Concerned as\r\nthis story is with the period of vague and legendary antiquity as well as\r\nwith the disorders of mediæval time and with centuries of seclusion, it is\r\nplain that it is not an easy task to present a trustworthy and connected\r\naccount of the momentous changes through which the empire has been called\r\nto pass. It would be impossible to state in detail the sources from which\r\nI have derived the material for this work. I place first and as most\r\nimportant a residence of several years in Japan, during which I became\r\nfamiliar with the character of the Japanese people and with the traditions\r\nand events of their history. Most of the works treating of Japan during\r\nand prior to the period of her seclusion, as well as the more recent\r\nworks, I have had occasion to consult. They will be found referred to in\r\nthe following pages. Beyond all others, however, I desire to acknowledge\r\nmy obligations to the _Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan_. A\r\nlist of the contributors to these transactions would include such names as\r\nSatow, Aston, Chamberlain, McClatchie, Gubbins, Geerts, Milne, Whitney,\r\nWigmore and others, whose investigations have made possible a reasonably\r\ncomplete knowledge of Japan. The _Transactions of the German Asiatic\r\nSociety_ are scarcely less noteworthy than those of her sister society. To\r\nthese invaluable sources of information are to be added Chamberlain’s\r\n_Things Japanese_, Rein’s _Japan_ and the _Industries of Japan_, Griffis’\r\n_Mikado’s Empire_, Mounsey’s _Satsuma Rebellion_, Dening’s _Life of\r\nHideyoshi_, the published papers of Professor E. S. Morse, and the two\r\nhandbooks prepared successively by Mr. Satow and Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nTo friends who have taken an interest in this publication I owe many\r\nthanks for valuable and timely help: to Dr. J. C. Hepburn, who for so many\r\nyears was a resident in Yokohama; to Mr. Benjamin Smith Lyman of\r\nPhiladelphia who still retains his interest in and knowledge of things\r\nJapanese; to Mr. Tateno, the Japanese Minister at Washington, and to the\r\ndepartments of the Japanese government which have furnished me material\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nIn the spelling of Japanese words I have followed, with a few exceptions,\r\nthe system of the Roman Alphabet Association (Rōmaji Kai) as given in its\r\npublished statement. I have also had constantly at hand Hepburn’s\r\n_Dictionary_, the _Dictionary of Towns and Roads_, by Dr. W. N. Whitney,\r\nand _Murray’s Handbook of Japan_, by B. H. Chamberlain. In accordance with\r\nthese authorities, in the pronunciation of Japanese words the consonants\r\nare to be taken at their usual English values and the vowels at their\r\nvalues in Italian or German.\r\n\r\nDAVID MURRAY.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              Bell At Kyoto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE JAPANESE ARCHIPELAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first knowledge of the Japanese empire was brought to Europe by Marco\r\nPolo after his return from his travels in China in A.D. 1295. He had been\r\ntold in China of “Chipangu,(1) an island towards the east in the high\r\nseas, 1500 miles from the continent; and a very great island it is. The\r\npeople are white, civilized, and well favored. They are idolaters, and are\r\ndependent on nobody. And I can tell you the quantity of gold they have is\r\nendless; for they find it in their own islands.” The name Chipangu is the\r\ntransliteration of the Chinese name which modern scholars write\r\nChi-pen-kue, by which Japan was then known in China. From it the Japanese\r\nderived the name Nippon, and then prefixed the term Dai (great), making it\r\nDai Nippon, the name which is now used by them to designate their empire.\r\nEuropeans transformed the Chinese name into Japan, or Japon, by which the\r\ncountry is known among them at present.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo’s mention of this island produced a great impression on the\r\ndiscoverers of the fifteenth century. In Toscanelli’s map, used by\r\nColumbus as the basis of his voyages, “Cipango” occupies a prominent place\r\nto the east of Asia, with no American continent between it and Europe. It\r\nwas the aim of Columbus, and of many subsequent explorers, to find a route\r\nto this reputedly rich island and to the eastern shores of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe islands composing the empire of Japan are situated in the northwestern\r\npart of the Pacific ocean. They are part of the long line of volcanic\r\nislands stretching from the peninsula of Kamtschatka on the north to\r\nFormosa on the south. The direction in which they lie is northeast and\r\nsouthwest, and in a general way they are parallel to the continent.\r\n\r\nThe latitude of the most northern point of Yezo is 45° 35’, and the\r\nlatitude of the most southern point of Kyūshū is 31°. The longitude of the\r\nmost eastern point of Yezo is 146° 17’, and the longitude of the most\r\nwestern point of Kyūshū is 130° 31’. The four principal islands therefore\r\nextend through 14° 35’ of latitude and 15° 46’ of longitude.\r\n\r\nThe Kurile islands(2) extending from Yezo northeast to the straits\r\nseparating Kamtschatka from the island of Shumushu belong also to Japan.\r\nThis last island has a latitude of 51° 5’ and a longitude of 157° 10’. In\r\nlike manner the Ryūkyū islands, lying in a southwest direction from Kyūshū\r\nbelong to Japan. The most distant island has a latitude of 24° and a\r\nlongitude of 123° 45’. The whole Japanese possessions therefore extend\r\nthrough a latitude of 27° 5’ and a longitude of 33° 25’.\r\n\r\nThe empire consists of four large islands and not less than three thousand\r\nsmall ones. Some of these small islands are large enough to constitute\r\ndistinct provinces, but the greater part are too small to have a separate\r\npolitical existence, and are attached for administrative purposes to the\r\nparts of the large islands opposite to which they lie. The principal\r\nisland is situated between Yezo on the north and Kyūshū on the south.\r\n\r\nFrom Omasaki, the northern extremity at the Tsugaru straits, to Tōkyō, the\r\ncapital, the island runs nearly north and south a distance of about 590\r\nmiles, and from Tōkyō to the Shimonoseki straits the greatest extension of\r\nthe island is nearly east and west, a distance of about 540 miles. That\r\nis, measuring in the direction of the greatest extension, the island is\r\nabout 1130 miles long. The width of the island is nowhere greater than two\r\nhundred miles and for much of its length not more than one hundred miles.\r\n\r\nAmong the Japanese this island has no separate name.(3) It is often called\r\nby them Hondo(4) which may be translated Main island. By this translated\r\nname the principal island will be designated in these pages. The term\r\nNippon or more frequently Dai Nippon (Great Nippon) is used by them to\r\ndesignate the entire empire, and it is not to be understood as restricted\r\nto the principal island.\r\n\r\nThe second largest island is Yezo, lying northeast from the Main island\r\nand separated from it by the Tsugaru straits. Its longest line is from\r\nCape Shiretoko at its northeast extremity to Cape Shira-kami on Tsugaru\r\nstraits, about 350 miles; and from its northern point, Cape Soya on the La\r\nPerouse straits to Yerimosaki, it measures about 270 miles. The centre of\r\nthe island is an elevated peak, from which rivers flow in all directions\r\nto the ocean. Hakodate the principal port is situated on Tsugaru straits\r\nand possesses one of the most commodious harbors of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe third in size of the great islands of Japan is Kyūshū, a name meaning\r\nnine provinces, referring to the manner in which it was divided in early\r\ntimes. It lies south from the western extremity of the Main island. Its\r\ngreatest extension is from north to south, being about 200 miles. Its\r\nwidth from east to west varies from sixty to ninety miles. Its temperature\r\nand products partake of a tropical character.\r\n\r\nTo the east of Kyūshū lies Shikoku (meaning four provinces) which is the\r\nfourth of the great islands of Japan. It is about one half as large as\r\nKyūshū, which in climate and productions it much resembles. It is south of\r\nthe western extension of the Main island and is nearly parallel to it. Its\r\nlength is about 170 miles.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of Japan one of its names among the natives was\r\nŌyashima, meaning the Great Eight Islands. The islands included in this\r\nname were: the Main island, Kyūshū, Shikoku, Awaji, Sado, Tsushima, Oki,\r\nand Iki. The large island of Yezo had not then been conquered and added to\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nAwaji is situated in the Inland sea between the Main island and Shikoku.\r\nIt is about fifty miles long and has an area of 218 square miles. Sado is\r\nsituated in the Japan sea, off the northwest coast of the Main island. It\r\nis about forty-eight miles long and has an area of about 335 square miles.\r\nTsushima lies half-way between Japan and Korea, and has a length of about\r\nforty-six miles, and an area of about 262 square miles. Oki lies off the\r\ncoast of Izumo and has an area of about 130 square miles. Finally Iki, the\r\nsmallest of the original great eight islands, lies west of the northern\r\nextremity of Kyūshū and has an area of fifty square miles.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese islands are invested on the east by the Pacific ocean. They\r\nare separated from the continent by the Okhotsk sea, the Japan sea, and\r\nthe Yellow sea. The Kuro Shiwo (black current) flows from the tropical\r\nwaters in a northeast direction, skirting the islands of Japan on their\r\neast coasts, and deflecting its course to the eastward carries its\r\nameliorating influences to the west coast of America. It is divided by the\r\nprojecting southern extremity of the island of Kyūshū, and a perceptible\r\nportion of it flows on the west coast of the Japanese islands through the\r\nJapan sea and out again into the Pacific ocean through the Tsugaru and the\r\nLa Perouse straits. The effect of the Kuro Shiwo upon the climate and\r\nproductions of the lands along which it flows is not greatly different\r\nfrom that of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic ocean, which in situation,\r\ndirection, and volume it resembles.\r\n\r\nThe body of water known among foreigners as the Inland sea, but which the\r\nJapanese call Seto-no-Uchi-Umi (the sea within the straits), is a\r\npicturesque sheet of water situated between the Linschoten straits on the\r\neast and the Shimonoseki straits on the west. The latter is seven miles\r\nlong and at its narrowest part not more than two thousand feet wide. It\r\nseparates Kyūshū on the south from the Main island on the north. The\r\nInland sea is occupied by an almost countless number of islands, which\r\nbear evidence of volcanic origin, and are covered with luxuriant\r\nvegetation. The lines of steamers from Shanghai and Nagasaki to the\r\nvarious ports on the Main island, and numberless smaller craft in every\r\ndirection, run through the Inland sea.\r\n\r\nThe principal islands of Japan are interspersed with mountains, hills and\r\nvalleys. Yezo the most northern of these islands is traversed by two\r\nranges of mountains; the one being the extension of the island of\r\nSaghalien, the other the extension of the Kurile islands. These two ranges\r\ncross each other at the centre of the island, and here the greatest\r\nelevation is to be found. The shape given to the island by these\r\nintersecting ranges is that of a four-pointed star. The rivers in nearly\r\nall cases flow from the centre outward to the sea. There are few large\r\nrivers. The most important is the Ishikari which empties into Ishikari\r\nbay. The valley of this river is the most rich and fertile part of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe mountain ranges on the Main island extend usually in the greatest\r\ndirection of the island. In the northern and central portions the ranges\r\nchiefly run north and south. In the western extension of this island the\r\nmountain ranges run in nearly an east and west direction. The ordinary\r\nheight attained by these ranges is not great, but there are many volcanic\r\npeaks which rise out of the surrounding mass to a great elevation. The\r\nhighest mountain in Japan is Fuji-san (sometimes called Fuji-yama). It is\r\nalmost conical in shape; although one side has been deformed by a volcanic\r\neruption which occurred in 1707. It stands not far from the coast, and is\r\ndirectly in view from the steamers entering the bay of Tōkyō on their way\r\nto Yokohama. It is about sixty miles from Tōkyō in a direct line, and\r\nthere are many places in the city from which it can be seen. Its top is\r\ncovered with snow during ten months of the year, which the heat of August\r\nand September melts away. The height of Fuji-san according to the\r\nmeasurement of English naval officers is 12,365 feet.(5)\r\n\r\nNext to Fuji-san the mountains most worthy of notice are Gas-san in Uzen,\r\nMitake in Shinano, the Nikkō mountains in Shimotsuke, Haku-san in Kaga,\r\nKirishima-yama in Hyūga, and Asama-yama in Shinano. Asama-yama is about\r\n8,000 feet high, and is an active volcano.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the Japanese islands have been affected with\r\nearthquakes. Occasionally they have been severe and destructive, but\r\nusually slight and ineffective. It is said that not less than five hundred\r\nshocks(6) occur in Japan each year. The last severe earthquake was in the\r\nautumn of 1891, when the central part of the Main island, especially in\r\nthe neighborhood of Gifu, was destructively disturbed. During the long\r\nhistory of the empire many notable cases(7) have occurred. Mr.\r\nHattori-Ichijo in a paper read before the Asiatic Society of Japan, March,\r\n1878, has compiled a list of destructive earthquakes, and has deduced from\r\nit some important generalizations.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with earthquakes in Japan as elsewhere are the\r\nphenomena of volcanoes. The whole archipelago bears evidence of volcanic\r\nformation. The long line of islands stretching from Kamtschatka to Borneo\r\nis plainly the product of continued volcanic action. Dr. Rein(8)\r\nenumerates eighteen active volcanoes now in existence within the empire.\r\nFuji-san in all its beauty was no doubt thrown up as a volcano. The last\r\ntime it was in action was in 1707, when in connection with a series of\r\nsevere earthquake shocks, an eruption took place on the south side of the\r\nmountain, and its symmetrical form was destroyed by the production of the\r\nnew crater, Hōye-san.\r\n\r\nAmong the mountainous districts many small lakes are found, a few of which\r\nare large enough to be navigated. In Yezo there are six considerable\r\nlakes. In the Main island the largest lake is Biwa, in the beautiful\r\nmountain region north of Kyōto. It received its name from its fancied\r\nresemblance to the shape of a musical instrument called a _biwa_. There is\r\na legend that this lake came into existence in a single night, when the\r\nvolcanic mountain Fuji-san 300 miles distant was raised to its present\r\nheight. It is about fifty miles long and about twenty miles broad at its\r\ngreatest width. It is said to be not less than 330 feet at its greatest\r\ndepth. It is navigated by steamboats and smaller craft. It is situated\r\nabout 350 feet above the ocean. Lake Suwa in Shinano is 2,635 feet above\r\nthe ocean. Lake Chūzenji in the Nikkō mountains is 4,400 feet; and Hakoné\r\nlake near Yokohama is 2,400 feet.\r\n\r\nOwing to the narrowness of the Main island, there are no rivers of a large\r\nsize. Most of them take their rise in the mountainous regions of the\r\nmiddle of the islands, and by a more or less circuitous route find their\r\nway to the ocean. The Tone-gawa (_gawa_ means river) is the longest and\r\nbroadest of the rivers of Japan. It rises in Kōtsuke and flows in an\r\neastern direction, receiving many tributaries, attains a breadth of more\r\nthan a mile, and with a current much narrowed, empties into the Pacific\r\nocean at Chōshi point. It is about 170 miles long and is navigated by\r\nboats for a great distance. The Shinano-gawa, which may be named as second\r\nin size, rises in the province of Shinano, flows in a northern direction,\r\nand empties into the Japan sea at Ni-igata. The Kiso-gawa also rises in\r\nthe high lands of Shinano, and, flowing southward, empties into Owari bay.\r\nThe Fuji-kawa(9) takes its rise in the northern part of the province of\r\nKai, and in its course skirting the base of Fuji-san on the west, empties\r\ninto Suruga bay. It is chiefly notable for being one of the swiftest\r\nstreams in Japan and liable to sudden and great floods.\r\n\r\nTo these rivers may be added the Yodo-gawa, which is the outlet of Lake\r\nBiwa, in the province of Ōmi, and which flows through Kyōto, and empties\r\ninto the Inland sea at Ōsaka. This river is navigable for flat-bottomed\r\nsteamboats as far as Kyōto. In the islands of Kyūshū and Shikoku there are\r\nno large rivers; but there are many streams which give to these islands\r\ntheir richness and fertility.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Japan, as might be expected from its great stretch from\r\nnorth to south, and the varied circumstances of ocean currents, winds, and\r\nmountains, is very different in the different parts. The latitude of Tōkyō\r\nis 35°, which is not very different from that of Cyprus in the\r\nMediterranean, or the city of Raleigh in North Carolina. Besides the\r\nlatitude of the islands of Japan, the most noticeable cause of their\r\nclimatic condition is the Kuro Shiwo (black current). This current flows\r\nfrom the tropical regions near the Philippine islands, impinges on the\r\nsouthern islands, and is divided by them into two unequal parts. The\r\ngreater part skirts the Japanese islands on their east coast, imparting to\r\nthem that warm and moist atmosphere, which is one source of the fertility\r\nof their soil and beauty of their vegetation. To this important cause must\r\nbe added another, which is closely related to it in its effects. The\r\nJapanese islands are in the region of the north-east monsoon,(10) which\r\naffects in a marked degree the climate of all parts over which the winds\r\nextend. The same monsoon blows over the eastern countries of the\r\ncontinent, but the insular character of Japan and the proximity of the\r\nwarm current on both sides of the islands give to the winds which prevail\r\na character which they do not possess on the continent. During the greater\r\npart of September the northern wind blows, which brings a colder\r\ntemperature, condensing the moisture contained in the atmosphere. This\r\nmonth is therefore generally a rainy month. Gradually the atmosphere\r\nbecomes more dry, and the beautiful autumn and early winter follow in\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe winter is very different in the different parts. On the east coast the\r\ntemperature is very moderate. Even as far north as Tōkyō the snow rarely\r\nfalls to a depth of more than a few inches, and then rapidly melts away.\r\nIce seldom forms to a thickness, even on protected waters, to permit\r\nskating. In all this region, however, snow covers the high mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of the Main island the conditions are very different.\r\nThe winds of the continent take up the moisture of the Japan sea, and\r\ncarry it to the west coast, and then, coming in contact with high ranges\r\nof mountains which run down the middle of the island, impart their\r\nmoisture in the form of rain in summer, and snow in winter. These\r\ncircumstances produce extraordinary falls of snow on the west coast. This\r\nis particularly true of the provinces of Kaga, Noto, Etchū, Echigo, and\r\neven farther north, especially in the mountainous regions. In the northern\r\npart of these districts the snow is often as much as twenty feet deep\r\nduring the winter months. The inhabitants are obliged to live in the\r\nsecond stories of their houses and often find it necessary to make steps\r\nfrom their houses out to the top of the snow. One effect of these deep\r\nsnows is to cover up with a safe protection the shrubs and tender plants\r\nwhich would otherwise be exposed to the chilling winds of winter. By this\r\nmeans the tea-shrub and the camellia, which could not withstand the open\r\nwinter winds, are protected so as to grow luxuriantly.\r\n\r\nThe southern islands are materially warmer than the Main island. The\r\ntropical current together with the warm sunshine due to their low\r\nlatitude, immerses them in a moist and warm atmosphere. Their productions\r\nare of a sub-tropical character. Cotton, rice, tobacco, sugar, sweet\r\npotatoes, oranges, yams, and other plants of a warm latitude, flourish in\r\nKyūshū and Shikoku. The high mountains and the well watered valleys, the\r\nabundance of forest trees, and wild and luxuriant vegetation,(11) give to\r\nthese islands an aspect of perennial verdure.\r\n\r\nThe productions of the Main island are, as might be expected, far more\r\nvarious. In the southern part, especially that part bordering on the\r\nInland sea, the productions are to a large extent similar to those in the\r\nsouthern islands. Rice and cotton are raised in great abundance. Tea\r\nflourishes particularly in the provinces near Kyōto and also in the rich\r\nvalleys of the east coast. Silk-raising is a principal occupation. Nearly\r\none half in value of all the exports from Japan is raw and manufactured\r\nsilk, and a large part of the remainder is tea. The principal food raised\r\nin nearly all the islands is rice. The streams of water which abound\r\neverywhere make the irrigation which rice cultivation requires easy and\r\neffective. Besides the rice which is raised in paddy land there is also a\r\nvariety called upland rice. This grows without irrigation but is inferior\r\nto the principal variety in productiveness. In the early rituals of the\r\nShintō temples prayers were always offered for the five cereals. These\r\nwere understood to be rice, millet, barley, beans, and sorghum. All these\r\nhave been cultivated from early times, and can be successfully raised in\r\nalmost all parts of the islands. Rice cannot, however, be raised north of\r\nthe Main island. Millet, barley, and beans are cultivated everywhere, and\r\nare the principal articles of food among the country population. Buckwheat\r\nis also cultivated in all northern parts. It is believed to have been\r\nintroduced from Manchuria where it is found growing wild.\r\n\r\nThe domestic animals of Japan are by no means so abundant as in the\r\ncorresponding parts of the continent. The horse has existed here from\r\nantiquity but was only used for riding or as a pack-horse, but never until\r\nrecently was used for driving. The cow, owing perhaps to the restrictive\r\ninfluence of the Buddhist doctrines, was never used for food. Even milk,\r\nbutter, and cheese, which from time immemorial formed such important\r\narticles of food throughout Europe and among the nomadic peoples of Asia,\r\nwere never used. Sheep are almost unknown even to this day, and where they\r\nhave been introduced it is only in very recent times and by foreign\r\nenterprise. Goats are sometimes but not commonly found. On the island of\r\nŌshima,(12) off the province of Izu, they had multiplied to so great an\r\nextent and were so destructive to vegetation that about 1850 the\r\ninhabitants combined to extirpate them. Swine are found in the Ryūkyū\r\nislands, where they had been brought from China and they are found only\r\nincidentally in other places when introduced by foreigners. Dogs and cats\r\nand barnyard fowl are found in all the islands.\r\n\r\nWild animals are only moderately abundant, as is natural in a country so\r\nthickly inhabited. The black bear is found frequently in the well-wooded\r\nmountains of Yezo and the northern part of the Main island. The great\r\nbear, called also by the Japanese the red bear, and which is the same as\r\nthe grizzly bear of North America, is also common in the Kurile islands\r\nand in Yezo. The wolf is sometimes found and the fox is common. The\r\nsuperstitions concerning the fox are as remarkable as those in the north\r\nof Europe, and have doubtless prevented its destruction. Deer are found in\r\nabundance in almost all parts of the islands. They are, however, most\r\ncommon in Yezo where immense herds feed upon the plentiful herbage.\r\n\r\nThe waters around Japan abound in fish. The coast is indented by bays and\r\ninlets which give opportunity for fishing. The warm currents flowing past\r\nthe islands bring a great variety of fish which otherwise would not reach\r\nthese islands. By far the most common article of food, other than\r\nvegetable, is the fish of various kinds and the shell-fish which are\r\ncaught on the coasts and carried inland to almost all parts.\r\n\r\nThe division of the empire into provinces (_kuni_) was an important step\r\nin practical administration, and it is often referred to in these pages.\r\nThis division was first made by the Emperor Seimu A.D. 131-190, when\r\nthirty-two provinces were constituted. The northern boundary of the empire\r\nwas indicated by a line across the Main island from Sendai bay to a place\r\non the west coast nearly corresponding to the present situation of\r\nNi-igata. North of this line was the acknowledged territory of the Ainos,\r\nand even south of it were many tracts which were the disputed border.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Jingō, after her return from the expedition against Korea in\r\nA.D. 303, introduced the Korean system of division, by constituting the\r\nhome provinces and circuits. After some changes and subdivisions in\r\nsubsequent times the apportionment was settled as follows: _Gokinai_ or\r\nthe five home provinces, viz. Yamashiro, Yamato, Kawachi, Izumi, and\r\nSettsu; _Tōkaidō_, or eastern sea circuit, 15 provinces; _Tōzandō_, or\r\neastern mountain circuit, eight provinces; _Sanindō_, or mountain back\r\ncircuit, eight provinces; _Sanyōdō_, or mountain front circuit, eight\r\nprovinces; and _Saikaidō_, or western sea circuit, nine provinces; in all\r\nsixty-eight provinces. After the close of the war of restoration in 1868,\r\nthe large territories in the north of the Main island represented by the\r\nprovinces of Mutsu and Dewa, which had been conquered from the Ainos, were\r\nsubdivided into seven provinces, thus making seventy-three. Still later\r\nthe island of Yezo, with which were associated the Kurile islands, was\r\ncreated a circuit under the name of _Hok-kaidō_, or north sea circuit,\r\nhaving eleven provinces. The number of existing provinces therefore is\r\neighty-four. In recent times these eighty-four provinces have for\r\nadministrative purposes been consolidated into three imperial cities\r\n(_fu_), forty-two prefectures (_ken_), and one territory (_chō_). The\r\nimperial cities (_fu_) are Tōkyō, Ōsaka, and Kyōto; the one territory\r\n(_chō_) comprises the island of Yezo and the adjacent small islands\r\nincluding the Kuriles; and the prefectures (_ken_) have been formed from\r\nthe provinces by combining and consolidating them in accordance with their\r\nconvenience and proximity.\r\n\r\nThere are only a few large cities in Japan, but very many of a small\r\nsize.(13) Tōkyō,(14) the capital, contains 1,155,200 inhabitants. Ōsaka,\r\nthe second largest city contains 473,541; Kyōto, the old capital, 289,588;\r\nNagoya, 170,433; Kōbé, 136,968; and Yokohama, 127,987. These are all the\r\ncities containing as many as 100,000 inhabitants. Besides these there are\r\nfour cities which have between 100,000 and 60,000; twelve which have\r\nbetween 60,000 and 40,000, and twelve which have between 40,000 and\r\n30,000. The number of smaller towns is very great. The division of the\r\ncountry into _daimiates_, and the maintenance of a _daimyō_ town in each\r\nled to the establishment of many cities and large villages.\r\n\r\nThe population of the empire of Japan is to a large extent massed in\r\ncities and villages. Even in the country, among the farmers, the people\r\nare gathered in settlements with wide spaces of cultivated and\r\nuncultivated land between. This is due in a great measure to the character\r\nof the crops and to the primitive nature of the cultivation. Rice, which\r\nis the most common crop, requires irrigation for its successful tillage.\r\nThis limits the area occupied to the valleys and to those hillsides where\r\nthe streams can be diverted to the rice fields. The area of land under\r\nactual cultivation is about 12,000,000 acres. It has been estimated that\r\nthe average amount of land under cultivation is only three quarters of an\r\nacre for each of those engaged in farming. This amount seems to us very\r\nlittle and can only be explained by the character of the cultivation. The\r\nland almost always is made to bear two crops each year. As soon as one\r\ncrop is cleared away, and often even before that, another is planted.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census(15) of 1890 the population of the Japanese empire\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\nKwazoku (nobles)              3,768\r\nShizoku (_samurai_)       2,008,641\r\nHeimin (common people)   38,441,052\r\nTotal                    40,453,461\r\n\r\nThe areas of the several large islands and their dependencies together\r\nwith their population are given below:\r\n\r\n                                Sq. m.

THE ORIGINAL AND SURVIVING RACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present population of Japan there are two distinct races, the Ainos\r\nand the Japanese. Of the former there is only a small number now remaining\r\nin the island of Yezo. There was also a remnant in the island of\r\nSaghalien, but in 1875, when a treaty was made with Russia ceding the\r\nJapanese claim to the southern half of Saghalien in exchange for the\r\nKurile islands, permission was granted for all Japanese subjects who\r\nwished, to remove to the Japanese island of Yezo. Accordingly among other\r\nJapanese subjects seven hundred and fifty Ainos removed to the valley of\r\nthe Ishikari, where they have continued to reside.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                               Aino Family\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ainos are probably the original race, who in early times inhabited the\r\nMain island down to the Hakoné pass and possibly farther to the south.\r\nFrom Japanese history we learn that the military forces of the empire were\r\nconstantly employed to suppress the disturbances caused by the barbarous\r\npeople of the north. The necessity of this forcible repression, which\r\nfrequently recurred, was a chief reason for the formation of a military\r\nclass in the early history of Japan. One of the duties imposed on\r\nYamato-dake by his imperial father (A.D. 71-130) was to chastise and\r\nsubdue the Yemishi. This is the name by which the barbarous peoples of the\r\nnorth and east were known among the Japanese. According to Chamberlain(16)\r\nin his translation of _Kojiki_, the Chinese characters with which the\r\nYemishi is written mean Prawn Barbarians, in allusion to the long beards\r\nwhich make their faces resemble a prawn’s head. The hairy people now known\r\nas Ainos are almost certainly referred to. The origin of the term Aino is\r\nunknown. By the Japanese it is believed to be derived from _inu_, meaning\r\na dog, and to have been bestowed on them in contempt. The name is not used\r\nby the Ainos themselves. In common with the inhabitants of the Kurile\r\nislands and the Japanese portion of Saghalien they call themselves Yezo.\r\n\r\nThe present characteristics of the Ainos have led many to doubt whether\r\nthey are really the descendants of the hardy barbarians who so long\r\nwithstood the military power of the Japanese. But the effect of centuries\r\nof repression and conquest must be taken into account. The Ainos have\r\nbecome the peaceable and inoffensive people which we now find them, by\r\nmany generations of cruel and imperious restraint. That they should have\r\nbecome in this sequence of events a quiet and submissive people is not\r\nwonderful. The number of Ainos in the island of Yezo is given in 1880,\r\nwhich is the last census made of them, as 16,637(17); and this number is\r\nbelieved to be gradually decreasing. Travellers who have visited them\r\nunite in testifying to their great amiability and docility. Physically\r\nthey are a sturdy and well developed race. The characteristic which has\r\nbeen noticed in them more than any other is the abundant growth of hair.\r\nThe men have a heavy and bushy head of hair and a full beard which is\r\nallowed to grow down to their chests. Other parts of the body are also\r\ncovered with a growth which far surpasses that of the ordinary races. In\r\nthe matter of food, clothing, houses and implements, they remain in the\r\nmost primitive condition. In personal habits they are far less cleanly\r\nthan their Japanese neighbors. Travellers(18) who have remained with them\r\nfor many weeks assert that in all that time they never saw them wash\r\neither their persons or their clothes.\r\n\r\nThey practise few arts. The making of pottery even in its rudest forms is\r\nunknown. All vessels in use are obtained by barter from the Japanese.\r\nOccasionally an old-fashioned Japanese matchlock gun is found among them,\r\nbut mainly their hunting is carried on with bows and arrows. Their fishing\r\nis conducted with the rude apparatus which their ancestors used. They have\r\nno written language, and even the pictorial writing, which has often been\r\nfound among rude people, seems to be utterly unknown among them. Their\r\nreligious ideas(19) are of the most vague and incoherent description. The\r\nobjects of worship are chiefly inanimate objects such as rivers, rocks and\r\nmountains. They seem to have a certain fear of the spirit land. They do\r\nnot readily talk about their deceased ancestors. Their places of burial\r\nare concealed, and foreigners rarely obtain access to them.\r\n\r\nIn their rude superstitions the bear seems to have a singular part.\r\nWhether their traditions concerning this animal had their origin in some\r\nearlier fear of the bear as a ferocious neighbor it is impossible to\r\ndetermine. In every community the men capture each spring a young cub\r\nwhich they bring home. They entrust it to a woman who feeds it on the milk\r\nfrom her breast. When it is too old to be further nursed in this way, it\r\nis confined in a bear cage provided for the purpose. Then in the autumn of\r\nthe following year the grand bear festival is held. At an appointed signal\r\nthe door of the cage is opened and the bear, which has been infuriated by\r\nhunger and teasing attacks, rushes out. The assembled hunters rush upon\r\nhim with bows and arrows, clubs and knives, and after an exciting struggle\r\ndespatch him. The carcass is cut in pieces and distributed among the\r\nfamilies of the community, who feast upon it with great delight. Mingled\r\nwith this rough and exciting scene is much _saké_ drinking. This is one\r\naccomplishment which they have learned from the Japanese. The men are all\r\nconfirmed _saké_ drinkers, and both men and women persistent smokers. Of\r\nthe meaning and object of this bear feast the Ainos themselves are\r\nignorant. It goes back to a period beyond their present traditions.\r\nWhether it has in it an element of bear worship it is impossible to learn.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Stone age which are found in the northern part of the\r\nMain island are usually attributed to the Ainos. These remains have been\r\ncollected and studied both by native scholars and by foreigners. Among the\r\nmost important of them have been the articles found in shell heaps\r\nuncovered in different parts of the empire. The first(20) to which foreign\r\nattention was drawn was that at Ōmori, near Tōkyō. Since then many others\r\nhave been opened and many valuable finds have been reported. The shell\r\nheaps have evidently been used like kitchen-middens in Europe and\r\nelsewhere, as places for dumping the refuse of shell-fish used for food.\r\nThese became places for the throwing of useless and broken articles used\r\nin the household, and thus have been the means of preserving many of the\r\nimplements used in prehistoric times. The most significant discovery made\r\nin these shell heaps was that at Ōmori, of the bones of human beings\r\nartificially broken in such a way as to indicate that cannibalism had been\r\nprevalent at the time. Whether this can be assumed as sufficient proof of\r\nso grave a charge has been disputed. It is claimed(21) that in at least\r\nseven similar shell heaps no human bones and no evidences of cannibalism\r\nwere found. If however the case is considered as sufficiently proved, it\r\nis clear from this as well as from many other circumstances that the Ainos\r\nof that early day were by no means the mild and gentle race which we now\r\nfind them. It is interesting to note that Marco Polo(22) mentions\r\ncannibalism as one of the customs which were believed to exist in Japan in\r\nhis day.\r\n\r\nBesides the Ainos there is evidence of the existence of another savage\r\ntribe, which at an early date seems to have been found in many parts of\r\nthe Main island, and at a later date in the island of Yezo and the Kurile\r\nislands on the north. They are the so-called pit-dwellers. In the very\r\nearliest writings of the Japanese we find references to them. They dug\r\npits in the earth and built over them a roof, and used these pits or\r\ncellars as rooms in which to sleep. The Japanese conquerors in the central\r\nparts of the Main island had many conflicts with these pit-dwellers. And\r\nin the north and east they as well as the Ainos were encountered by the\r\nmilitary forces of the empire. They were probably driven north by the more\r\npowerful Ainos and have almost disappeared. Abundant evidence(23) however\r\nis found in the island of Yezo of their previous existence. The Ainos in\r\ntheir traditions call them Koro-pok-guru,(24) or hole-men. Among the\r\nJapanese they are spoken of as Ko-bito, or dwarfs. There are said to be\r\nstill in Yezo the remains of villages where these men lived in earlier\r\ntimes. In the Kurile islands, in the peninsula of Kamtschatka, and in the\r\nsouthern part of Saghalien remnants of this primitive people are met with.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Japanese race which extends from the Kurile islands on\r\nthe north to the Ryūkyū islands on the south, we see at once that it is a\r\nmixed race containing widely different elements. Even after the many\r\ncenturies during which the amalgamation has been going on, we recognize\r\nstill the varying types to which the individuals tend. In the south more\r\nthan in the north, and more among the ruling classes than in the laboring\r\nclasses there are specimens of a delicate, refined appearance, face oval,\r\neyes oblique, nose slightly Roman, and frame delicate but well\r\nproportioned. Then there is another type which has been recognized by all\r\nobservers. It is found more in the north than the south and is much more\r\ncommon among the laboring population than among the higher classes. The\r\nface is broad and the cheek bones prominent. The nose is flat and the eyes\r\nare horizontal. The frame is robust and muscular, but not so well\r\nproportioned and regular as in the former type. These two types with many\r\nintervening links are found everywhere. The characteristics are perhaps\r\nmore marked among the women than the men. Especially among the aristocracy\r\nthe women have been less affected by weather and exposure and physical\r\nexertion than the men. In the regions about Kyōto and in the western\r\nportions of the Main island the prevalence of what may be called the\r\naristocratic type is most marked. Even in the time of the Dutch trade with\r\nJapan, Kaempfer(25) refers to the women of Saga, on the south coast of the\r\nInland sea, as “handsomer than in any other Asiatic country.” The northern\r\nregions, including the old provinces of Mutsu and Dewa, show a much larger\r\nelement of the more robust type. The men are more muscular and of a darker\r\ncomplexion. Their faces are broader and flatter and their hair and beard\r\nmore abundant. They show probably the influence of the admixture with the\r\nAino race, which within historic times inhabited these provinces.\r\n\r\nDr. Baelz, a German scholar who has spent many years in Japan, has devoted\r\nmuch study to the races of Japan, and has made elaborate measurements both\r\nof living specimens and skeletons. His conclusions may be safely followed,\r\nas having been reached by adequate study and by personal\r\ninvestigation.(26) Mainly following him therefore we give briefly the\r\nresults of the best thought in regard to the ethnography of the races now\r\ninhabiting the Japanese islands.\r\n\r\nThe Ainos of the present day are the descendants of the original occupants\r\nof northern and central portions of the Main island. Their share in the\r\nancestry of the present Japanese people is not great, but still sensible,\r\nand has contributed to the personal peculiarities which are found in the\r\ninhabitants of these regions. They probably came originally from the\r\ncontinent by way of the Kurile islands, or by the island of Saghalien.\r\nThey belong to the northern group of the Mongolians who inhabit the\r\nregions about Kamtschatka and adjacent parts of Siberia. They have left\r\nmarks of their occupancy on the Main island as far south as the Hakoné\r\npass, in the shell heaps, flint arrow-heads, and remains of primitive\r\npottery which are still found. These marks indicate a low degree of\r\ncivilization, and the persistence with which they withstood the Japanese\r\nconquerors, and the harshness and contempt with which they were always\r\ntreated, have prevented them from mingling to any great extent with their\r\nconquerors or accepting their culture.\r\n\r\nThe twofold character of the Japanese race as it is seen at present can\r\nbest be explained by two extensive migrations from the continent. The\r\nfirst of these migrations probably took place from Korea, whence they\r\nlanded on the Main island in the province of Izumo. This will account for\r\nthe mythological legends which in the early Japanese accounts cluster to\r\nso great an extent around Izumo. It will also explain why it was that when\r\nJimmu Tennō came on his expedition from the island of Kyūshū, he found on\r\nthe Main island inhabitants who in all essential particulars resembled his\r\nown forces, and with whom he formed alliances. This first migration seems\r\nto have belonged to a rougher and more barbarous tribe of the Mongolian\r\nrace, and has given rise to the more robust and muscular element now found\r\namong the people.\r\n\r\nThe second migration may have come across by the same route and landed on\r\nthe island of Kyūshū. They may have marched across the island or skirted\r\naround its southern cape and spread themselves out in the province of\r\nHyūga, where in the Japanese accounts we first find them. This migration\r\nprobably occurred long after the first, and came evidently from a more\r\ncultured tribe of the great Mongolian race. That they came from the same\r\nrace is evident from their understanding the same language, and having\r\nhabits and methods of government which were not a surprise to the\r\nnew-comers, and in which they readily co-operated. On the contrary, the\r\nruder tribes at the north of the Main island were spoken of as\r\nYemishi,—that is, barbarians, and recognized from the first as different\r\nand inferior.\r\n\r\nWhile the natural and easiest route to Japan would be by way of the\r\npeninsula of Korea, and by the narrow straits about 125 miles in\r\nwidth,—divided into two shorter parts by the island Tsushima lying about\r\nhalf-way between,—it is possible that this second migration may have taken\r\nplace through Formosa and the Ryūkyū islands. This would perhaps account\r\nbetter for the Malay element which is claimed by many to be found in the\r\npopulation of the southern islands. This is attempted to be accounted for\r\nby the drifting of Malay castaways along the equatorial current upon the\r\nRyūkyū islands, whence they spread to the southern islands of Japan. But\r\nthe existence of this Malay element is denied by many observers who have\r\nvisited the Ryūkyū islands and aver that among the islanders there is no\r\nevidence of the existence at any time of a Malay immigration, that the\r\nlanguage is only slightly different from the Japanese, and in personal\r\nappearance they are as like to the Koreans and Chinese as the Japanese\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important measurements which Dr. Baelz has made of the\r\nJapanese races are here given, converted into English measures for more\r\nready comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe average height of the males among the Japanese, as obtained by the\r\nmeasurements of skeletons verified by measurements of living specimens, is\r\n5.02 feet, ranging from 4.76 feet to 5.44 feet. The average height of the\r\nfemales measured was 4.66 feet, ranging from 4.46 feet to 4.92 feet.\r\nReferring to the skulls measured by him he says that relatively they are\r\nlarge, as is always the case among people of small size.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of the Ainos by Dr. Scheube as given by Dr. Rein(27) are:\r\naverage height of males 4.9 feet to 5.2 feet, and of females 4.8 feet to\r\n5.0 feet, which do not differ very greatly from the measurements of the\r\nJapanese as given by Dr. Baelz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. MYTHS AND LEGENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of writing and printing was not introduced into Japan until A.D.\r\n284, when it was brought from China. Up to that time therefore no written\r\naccounts existed or could exist of the early history of the country. Oral\r\ntradition was the only agency by which a knowledge of the events of that\r\nepoch could be preserved and transmitted. That such a method of preserving\r\nhistory(28) is uncertain and questionable no one can doubt. We may expect\r\nto find therefore in the accounts which have come down to us of those\r\ncenturies which transpired before written records were introduced, much\r\nthat is contradictory and unintelligible, and much out of which the truth\r\ncan be gleaned only by the most painstaking research.\r\n\r\nThe oldest book of Japanese history which has come down to us is called\r\n_Kojiki_,(29) or _Records of Ancient __ Matters_. This work was undertaken\r\nby the direction of the Emperor Temmu (A.D. 673-686), who became impressed\r\nwith the necessity of collecting the ancient traditions which were still\r\nextant, and preserving them in a permanent record. Before the work was\r\nended the emperor died, and for twenty-five years the collected traditions\r\nwere preserved in the memory of Hiyeda-no-are. At the end of that time the\r\nEmpress Gemmyō superintended its completion, and it was finally presented\r\nto the Court in A.D. 711. By a comparison of this work with _Nihongi_, or\r\n_Chronicles of Japan_, which was completed A.D. 720, only nine years after\r\nthe other, we are convinced that the era of Chinese classicism had not yet\r\nfallen upon the country. The style of the older book is a purer Japanese,\r\nand imparts to us the traditions of Japanese history uncolored by Chinese\r\nphilosophical ideas and classic pedantry which shortly after overwhelmed\r\nJapanese literature. But in many particulars these two works, almost\r\nequally ancient, supplement and explain each other. The events given in\r\nthe two are in most respects the same, the principal difference being that\r\nthe _Chronicles_ is much more tinctured with Chinese philosophy, and the\r\nmyths concerning the creation especially show the influence of that dual\r\nsystem which had been introduced to give a philosophical aspect to the\r\nJapanese cosmogony.\r\n\r\nThe _Kojiki_(30) has been translated into English, to which have been\r\nadded a valuable introduction and notes. The _Nihongi_ (_Chronicles of\r\nJapan_) has never been translated entire into English, but has been used\r\nby scholars in connection with the _Kojiki_. Among the Japanese it has\r\nalways been more highly esteemed than the _Kojiki_, perhaps because of its\r\nmore learned and classical style.\r\n\r\nBesides these two historical works the student of early times finds his\r\nchief assistance in the Shintō rituals(31) contained in a work called\r\n_Yengishiki_ (_Code of Ceremonial Law_). They have been in part translated\r\nby Mr. Satow, who for many years was the learned Japanese secretary of the\r\nBritish legation, and who read two papers on them before the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Japan, and afterward prepared an article on the same subject\r\nfor the _Westminster Review_.(32)\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent from these circumstances that the knowledge of the\r\nearlier events, indeed of all preceding the ninth century, must be derived\r\nfrom tradition and cannot claim the same certainty as when based on\r\ncontemporaneous documents. Not only the whole of the so-called divine age,\r\nbut the reigns of the emperors from Jimmu to Richū, must be reckoned as\r\nbelonging to the traditional period of Japanese history, and must be\r\nsifted and weighed by the processes of reason.\r\n\r\nRelying on the narratives of the _Kojiki_ and the _Nihongi_, Japanese\r\nscholars have constructed a table of the emperors which has been accepted\r\nby the great mass of the readers, both foreign and native. It will be\r\nfound in the Appendix.(33) It must be remembered that the names of these\r\nearly emperors, their ages at the time of accession and at the time of\r\ndeath, and the length of reign, must have all been handed down by\r\ntradition during almost a thousand years. That errors and uncertainties\r\nshould have crept in seems inevitable. Either the names and order of the\r\nsuccessive emperors, or the length of time during which they reigned would\r\nbe liable to be misstated. If we examine the list of emperors(34) we find\r\nthat the ages at death of the first seventeen, beginning with Jimmu and\r\nending with Nintoku, sum up 1853 years, with an average of 109 years(35)\r\nfor each. The age of Jimmu is given as 127 years; of Kōan 137 years, of\r\nKōrei 128 years, of Keikō 143 years, of Nintoku, the last, 110 years, etc.\r\nThen suddenly the ages of the emperors from Richū onward drop to 67, 60,\r\n80, 56, etc., so that the ages of the seventeen emperors, beginning with\r\nRichū, have an average of only 61-½ years. This reasonable average extends\r\ndown through the long series to the present time. It is plain that up to\r\nthis time there must have existed a different system of reckoning the ages\r\nthan that which pertained afterwards. Either the original epoch of the\r\nEmperor Jimmu has been rendered more remote and the lives of the emperors\r\nhave been prolonged to fill up the space, or, if we assume the epoch of\r\nJimmu to be correct, we must suppose that a number of the emperors have\r\nbeen dropped from the count.\r\n\r\nThe sudden depression in the ages occurs about the time of the\r\nintroduction of writing from China, which occurred in A.D. 284. Wani, who\r\ncame from Korea to Japan bringing continental culture with him, was\r\nappointed tutor to the heir-apparent who became the Emperor Nintoku.\r\nDuring his and subsequent reigns a knowledge of Chinese writing gradually\r\nspread, so that the annals of the Imperial court were kept in regular and\r\nstated order. This will account without difficulty for the sudden change\r\nand for the irregularity of the early chronology.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the almost absolute certainty of error which exists in the\r\nreceived Japanese chronology, it is by far more convenient to accept it in\r\nthe form it is presented to us, and use it as if it were true. The early\r\nhistory must be treated as traditional and only the later period from the\r\nbeginning of the fourth century can be accepted as in any sense\r\nhistorical. Yet the events of the earlier period which have been preserved\r\nfor us by oral tradition are capable with due care and inspection of\r\nfurnishing important lessons and disclosing many facts in regard to the\r\nlives and characteristics of the primitive Japanese.\r\n\r\nIn writing the history of Rome, Dr. Thomas Arnold(36) said that the only\r\nway to treat its early history was to give the early legends in as nearly\r\nthe form in which they had been handed down as possible; that in this way\r\nthe spirit of the people would be preserved and the residuum of truth in\r\nthem would become the heritage of the present generation. We have tried to\r\ntreat the myths and legends of Japanese history in this manner, and have\r\ngiven the principal stories as they are preserved among the Japanese.\r\n\r\n_The Origin of the Celestial Deities._\r\n\r\nThe scene opens in the plain of high heaven. When heaven and earth began\r\nthere were three deities(37) in existence, that is:\r\n\r\nMaster-of-the-August-Centre-of-Heaven,\r\nHigh-August-Producing-Wondrous-Deity,\r\nDivine-Producing-Wondrous-Deity.\r\n\r\nThese three came into existence without creation and afterwards died.\r\n\r\nThen two other deities were born from a thing that sprouted up like unto a\r\nreed shoot when the earth, young and like unto floating oil, drifted about\r\nmedusa-like, viz.:\r\n\r\nPleasant-Reed-Shoot-Prince-Elder-Deity,\r\nHeavenly-Externally-Standing-Deity.\r\n\r\nThese two deities likewise came into existence without creation and\r\nafterward died.\r\n\r\nThe five deities above named are called the Heavenly Deities.\r\n\r\nNext were born,\r\n\r\nEarthly-Eternally-Standing-Deity,\r\nLuxuriant-Integrating-Master-Deity.\r\n\r\nThese two deities likewise came into existence without creation and\r\nafterwards died.\r\n\r\nNext were born,\r\n\r\nMud-Earth-Lord and Mud-Earth-Lady,\r\nGerm-Integrating-Deity and Life-Integrating-Deity,\r\nElder-of-the-Great-Place and Elder-Lady-of-the-Great-Place,\r\nPerfect-Exterior and Oh-Awful-Lady,\r\nThe-Male-who-invites and The-Female-who-invites;\r\nor Izanagi and Izanami.\r\n\r\nThe two deities named above together with these five pairs are called the\r\nseven divine generations.\r\n\r\n_The Creation of the Japanese Islands._\r\n\r\nThen the heavenly deities gave commandment to Izanagi and Izanami to make,\r\nconsolidate, and give birth to this drifting land. For their divine\r\nmission they received a heavenly jewelled spear. With this, standing on\r\nthe floating bridge of heaven, they reached down and stirred the brine and\r\nthen drew up the spear. The brine that dripped from the end of the spear\r\nwas piled up and became the island of Onogoro(38) or Self-Coagulated\r\nIsland. Then the pair descended upon this island and erected thereon a\r\npalace eight fathoms long. Here they lived and begat successive islands.\r\nThe first was the island of Hirugo, which, as it was a miscarriage, they\r\nput in a boat of bulrushes and let it float away. The second was the\r\nisland of Awa, which also is not reckoned among their offspring. The next\r\nwas the island of Awaji,(39) and the next the land of Iyo by which is\r\nunderstood the present island of Shikoku.\r\n\r\nSo in succession they produced the islands of Mitsugo, near the island of\r\nOki, the island of Tsukushi, which is now called Kyūshū, the island of\r\nIki, the island of Tsu, and the island of Sado, and lastly the\r\nGreat-Yamato-the-Luxuriant-Island-of-the-Dragon-Fly, which is supposed to\r\nmean the principal island, named in these pages the Main island. Afterward\r\nthey produced Kojima in Kibi, Ōshima, the island of Adzuki, the island of\r\nHime, the island of Chika, and the islands of Futago.\r\n\r\nThus were finished the labors of this industrious pair in producing the\r\nislands of Japan. Then they turned to the duty of begetting additional\r\ndeities, and thirty-five are named as their descendants. But as their\r\nnames do not appear in the record of subsequent events, we omit them here.\r\nFinally the Deity of Fire was born, and the mother in giving birth to this\r\nchild died and departed into hades. Izanagi was overwhelmed with grief at\r\nhis wife’s death. The tears which he shed turned into the\r\nCrying-Weeping-Female-Deity. In his madness he drew the ten-grasp(40)\r\nsabre with which he was augustly girded, and cut off the head of the Deity\r\nof Fire. Three deities were born from the blood that stuck to the blade;\r\nthree were born from the blood that besprinkled the sword guard; two were\r\nborn from the blood which oozed out through his fingers as they grasped\r\nthe hilt; and eight were born from the head and trunk of the slaughtered\r\ndeity.\r\n\r\n_Descent into Hades._\r\n\r\nThen Izanagi resolved to follow his spouse into the land of hades. At the\r\ngate of the palace of hades she came out to meet him. After an interview\r\nwith him she went back to seek the advice of the deities of hades. To her\r\nimpatient husband she seemed to tarry too long. So he broke off the\r\nend-tooth of the comb stuck in his hair, and kindling it as a torch he\r\nwent in. He was appalled by the dreadful pollution of the place, and by\r\nthe loathsome condition of his spouse. He fled from the scene followed by\r\nthe furious guards. By guile and by force, however, he escaped and came\r\nagain to the upper regions.\r\n\r\n_Purification of Izanagi._\r\n\r\nThen Izanagi, in order to purify himself from the pollution of hades, came\r\nto a small stream on the island of Tsukushi. So he threw down the august\r\nstaff which he carried and it became a deity. He took off his girdle and\r\nit became a deity. He threw down his skirt and it became a deity. And he\r\ntook off his upper garment and it became a deity. And from his trousers\r\nwhich he threw down there was born a deity. Three deities were born from\r\nthe bracelet which he took from his left arm, and three from the bracelet\r\nwhich he took from his right arm. Thus twelve deities were born from the\r\nthings which he took off.\r\n\r\nThen he found that the waters in the upper reach were too rapid, and the\r\nwaters in the lower reach were too sluggish. So he plunged into the waters\r\nof the middle reach. And as he washed, there were born successive deities,\r\nwhose names it is not needful to mention. But when he washed his left\r\naugust eye there was born from it the\r\nHeaven-Shining-Great-August-Deity,(41) or as she is often called the Sun\r\nGoddess.\r\n\r\nWhen he washed his right august eye there was born\r\nHis-Augustness-Moon-Night-Possessor. Then when he washed his august nose\r\nthere was born His-Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness. Thus fourteen\r\ndeities were born from his bathing. All these deities, as well as those\r\nbefore produced, seem to have come into being in full maturity, and did\r\nnot need years of growth to develop their final powers.\r\n\r\nIzanagi was greatly delighted with the beauty and brilliancy of these last\r\nthree children. He took from his neck his august necklace and gave it to\r\nthe Sun Goddess, saying, Rule thou in the plains of high heaven. Then he\r\ngave command to the Moon-Night-Possessor, Rule thou the dominion of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAnd to His-Impetuous-Male-Augustness he commanded, Rule thou the plain of\r\nthe sea. But His-Impetuous-Male-Augustness did not assume command of his\r\ndomain, but cried and wept till his beard reached the pit of his stomach.\r\nThen Izanagi said to him, How is it that thou dost not take possession of\r\nthy domain, but dost wail and weep? He replied, I weep because I wish to\r\ngo to my mother in hades. Then Izanagi said, If that be so thou shalt not\r\ndwell in this land. So he expelled him with a divine expulsion (whatever\r\nthat may mean).\r\n\r\n_Visit of His-Impetuous-Male-Augustness to the Heavenly Plains._\r\n\r\nThen His-Impetuous-Male-Augustness said, I will first take leave of my\r\nsister who rules in the plains of heaven. When the Sun Goddess saw her\r\nbrother coming she put jewels in her hair and on her arms, slung two\r\nquivers of arrows on her back, put an elbow pad upon her left arm, and,\r\nbrandishing her bow, she went out to meet him. She demanded of him why he\r\nascended hither. Then he replied that he had no malicious intentions; that\r\nhis august father had expelled him with a divine expulsion, and that he\r\nhad come to take leave of her before departing to the land of hades.\r\n\r\nThereupon she proposed to him a test of his sincerity. They stood on\r\nopposite sides of the tranquil river of heaven. She begged him to reach\r\nher his mighty sabre. She broke it into three pieces and crunched the\r\npieces in her mouth, and blew the fragments away. Her breath and the\r\nfragments which she blew away were turned into three female deities. Then\r\nHis-Impetuous-Male-Augustness took the jewels which she wore in her hair,\r\nand the jewels which she wore in her head-dress, and the jewels she wore\r\non her left arm, and the jewels she wore on her right arm, and crunched\r\nthem and blew them out, and they were turned into five male deities. Then\r\nthe Sun Goddess declared that the three female deities which were produced\r\nfrom her brother’s sword belonged to him, and the five male deities which\r\nwere produced from her own jewels belonged to her. But\r\nHis-Impetuous-Male-Augustness was angry at this decision, and broke down\r\nthe fences of her rice fields, and filled up the water sluices, and\r\ndefiled her garden. And as she sat with her maidens in the weaving hall,\r\nhe broke a hole in the roof and dropped upon them a piebald horse which he\r\nhad flayed with a backward flaying.(42)\r\n\r\n_Retirement of the Sun Goddess._\r\n\r\nThen the Sun Goddess closed the door of the cave in which the weaving hall\r\nwas, and the whole plain of heaven and the Central-Land-of-Reed-Plains\r\nwere darkened, and night prevailed, and portents of woe were seen on every\r\nhand. Myriads of deities assembled in the bed of the tranquil river of\r\nheaven and besought the deity Thought-Includer, child of the\r\nHigh-August-Producing-Wondrous-Deity, the second of the original trio of\r\ndeities, to propose a plan for inducing the Sun Goddess to reappear. They\r\ngathered the cocks of the barn-door fowl and made them crow; they wrought\r\na metal mirror; they constructed a string of beautiful jewels; they\r\nperformed divination with the shoulder-blade of a stag; they took a plant\r\nof Sakaki and hung on its branches the strings of jewels, the mirror, and\r\nofferings of peace. Then they caused the rituals to be recited, and a\r\ndance to be danced, and all the assembled deities laughed aloud. The Sun\r\nGoddess heard these sounds of merriment and was amazed. She softly opened\r\nthe door and looked out, and asked the meaning of all this tumult. They\r\ntold her it was because they had found another goddess more illustrious\r\nthan she. At the same time they held before her luminous face the mirror\r\nwhich they had made. Astonished, she stepped out, and they shut and\r\nfastened the door behind her. And the plain of heaven and the\r\nCentral-Land-of-Reed-Plains became light again.\r\n\r\nThen the assembled deities took council together, and caused\r\nHis-Impetuous-Male-Augustness to be punished and expelled with a divine\r\nexpulsion.\r\n\r\n_His-Impetuous-Male-Augustness in Izumo._\r\n\r\nSo His-Impetuous-Male-Augustness came to the river Hi in Izumo. And he\r\nfound there an old man and an old woman and a young girl, and they were\r\nweeping. And he asked them why they wept. And the old man answered. I once\r\nhad eight daughters; but every year an eight-forked serpent comes and\r\ndevours one of them; and now it is the time for it to come again. Then the\r\ndeity said, Wilt thou give me thy daughter if I save her from the serpent?\r\nAnd he eagerly promised her. Then the deity said, Do you brew eight tubs\r\nof strong _saké_, and set each on a platform within an enclosure. So they\r\nbrewed and set the _saké_ according to his bidding. Then the eight-forked\r\nserpent came and putting a head in each tub drank up all the _saké_, and\r\nbeing intoxicated therewith went to sleep. The deity then with his sabre\r\nhacked the serpent in pieces, and the blood flowed out and reddened the\r\nriver. But when he came to the middle tail his sabre was broken, and when\r\nhe searched he found that within the tail was a great sword which he took\r\nout. And this is the herb-quelling-great-sword.\r\n\r\nThen His-Impetuous-Male-Augustness built for himself a palace and dwelt\r\nthere with his wife, and made the old man the master of his palace.\r\n\r\nHere follows a line of legends relating to the deities of the land of\r\nIzumo, which do not concern particularly our story, except that they show\r\nthat Izumo was closely connected with the early migrations from the\r\ncontinent. It must be remembered that Izumo lies almost directly opposite\r\nto Korea, and that this would be a natural point to which the nomadic\r\ntribes of Asia would turn in seeking for new fields in which to settle.\r\n\r\n_Plans for Pacifying the Land._\r\n\r\nThen the heavenly deities consulted together how they might pacify the\r\nlands of Japan. They sent down one of their number to report on its\r\ncondition. But he went no farther than the floating bridge of heaven, and\r\nseeing the violence which prevailed he returned. Then they sent another;\r\nbut he made friends with the insurgent deities and brought back no report.\r\nAgain they sent an envoy, who married the daughter of the insurgent deity,\r\nand for eight years sent back no report. After this they sent a pheasant\r\ndown to inquire why a report was not sent. This bird perched on a cassia\r\ntree at the palace gate of the delinquent envoy, and he hearing its\r\nmournful croaking shot it with an arrow, which flew up through the ether\r\nand landed in the plains of heaven. The arrow was shot down again and\r\nkilled the envoy. Finally two other envoys were sent down, who landed in\r\nIzumo, and after some parley with the refractory deities of the land\r\nreceived their adhesion and settled and pacified the land. Then they\r\nreturned to the heavenly plains and reported that peace was established.\r\n\r\n_Descent of the August Grandchild._\r\n\r\nThe Central-Land-of-Reed-Plains(43) being now reported as peaceful, the\r\nheavenly deities sent\r\nHis-Augustness-Heaven-Plenty-Earth-Plenty-Heaven’s-Sun-Height-Prince-Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty,(44)\r\nwho was a grandson of Her-Augustness-the-Sun-Goddess, to dwell in and rule\r\nover it. There were joined to him in this mission(45) the\r\nDeity-Prince-of-Saruta as his vanguard and five chiefs of companies. They\r\ngave him also the string of jewels and the mirror with which the Sun\r\nGoddess had been allured from the cave, and also the\r\nherb-quelling-great-sword which His-Augustness-the-Impetuous-Male-Deity\r\nhad taken from the tail of the serpent. And they charged him saying,\r\nRegard this mirror precisely as if it were our august spirit, and\r\nreverence it as if reverencing us.\r\n\r\nThen His-Augustness-Heaven’s-Prince-Rice-Ear-Ruddy-Plenty, taking leave of\r\nthe plains of heaven, and pushing asunder the heavenly spreading clouds,\r\ndescended upon the peak of Takachiho(46) in Tsukushi, a mountain which is\r\nstill pointed out in the present island of Kyūshū. And noting that the\r\nplace was an exceedingly good country, he built for himself a palace and\r\ndwelt there. And he married a wife who was the daughter of a deity of the\r\nplace, who bore him three sons whom he named Prince Fire-Shine, Prince\r\nFire-Climax, and Prince Fire-Subside.\r\n\r\n_Princes Fire-Shine and Fire-Subside._\r\n\r\nNow Prince Fire-Shine was a notable fisherman and Prince Fire-Subside was\r\na hunter. And Prince Fire-Subside said unto his elder brother, Let us\r\nexchange our occupations and try our luck. And after some hesitation on\r\nthe part of the elder brother the exchange was made. But Prince\r\nFire-Subside was not successful and lost the fish-hook in the sea. Then\r\nPrince Fire-Shine proposed to his younger brother to exchange back the\r\nimplements which they had used. But the younger brother said he had had no\r\nluck and had lost the hook in the sea. But Prince Fire-Shine was angry and\r\ndemanded his hook. Then Prince Fire-Subside broke his sword into many\r\nfragments and made them into fish-hooks, which he gave to his brother in\r\nplace of the one he had lost. But he would not receive them. Then he made\r\na thousand fish-hooks and offered these. But he said, I want my original\r\nhook.\r\n\r\nAnd as Prince Fire-Subside was weeping by the sea shore the Deity\r\nSalt-Possessor came to him and asked him why he wept. He replied, I have\r\nexchanged a fish-hook with my elder brother, and have lost it, and he will\r\nnot be satisfied with any compensation I can make, but demands the\r\noriginal hook. Then the Deity Salt-Possessor built a boat and set him in\r\nit, and said to him, Sail on in this boat along this way, and you will\r\ncome to a palace built of fishes’ scales. It is the palace of the Deity\r\nOcean-Possessor. There will be a cassia tree by the well near the palace.\r\nGo and sit in the top of that tree, and the daughter of the\r\nOcean-Possessor will come to thee and tell thee what to do.\r\n\r\nSo he sailed away in the boat and came to the palace of the\r\nOcean-Possessor, and he climbed the cassia tree and sat there. And the\r\nmaidens of the daughter of the Sea Deity came out to draw water, and saw\r\nthe beautiful young man sitting in the tree. Then he asked them for some\r\nwater. And they drew water and gave it to him in a jewelled cup. Without\r\ndrinking from it he took the jewel from his neck and put it in his mouth\r\nand spat it into the vessel, and it clung to the vessel. So the maidens\r\ntook the vessel and the jewel clinging to it into the palace to their\r\nmistress. And they told her that a beautiful young man was sitting in the\r\ncassia tree by the well.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Deity then went out himself and recognized the young man as Prince\r\nFire-Subside. He brought him into the palace, spread rugs for him to sit\r\non, and made a banquet for him. He gave him his daughter in marriage, and\r\nhe abode there three years.\r\n\r\nAt last one morning his daughter reported to the Sea Deity that Prince\r\nFire-Subside, although he had passed three years without a sigh, yet last\r\nnight he had heaved one deep sigh. The Sea Deity asked him why he sighed.\r\nThen Prince Fire-Subside told him about his difficulty with his brother,\r\nand how he would accept no compensation for his lost fish-hook, but\r\ndemanded the return of the original. Thereupon the Sea Deity summoned\r\ntogether all the fishes of the sea and asked them if any one of them had\r\nswallowed this hook. And all the fishes said that the _tai_ had complained\r\nof something sticking in its throat, and doubtless that was the lost hook.\r\nThe throat of the _tai_ therefore being examined, the hook was found and\r\ngiven to Prince Fire-Subside.\r\n\r\nThen the Sea Deity dismissed him to his own country, and gave him two\r\njewels, a flow-tide jewel and an ebb-tide jewel. And he set him on the\r\nhead of an immense crocodile and bade the crocodile convey him carefully\r\nand come back and make a report. And Prince Fire-Subside gave the\r\nrecovered hook to his brother. But a spirit of animosity still dwelt in\r\nhis heart, and he tried to kill his brother. Then Prince Fire-Subside\r\nthrew out the flow-tide jewel, and the tide came in upon the Prince\r\nFire-Shine and was about to drown him. And he cried out to his brother and\r\nexpressed his repentance. Then Prince Fire-Subside threw out the ebb-tide\r\njewel and the tide flowed back and left him safe.\r\n\r\nThen Prince Fire-Shine bowed his head before his younger brother, and\r\nsaid, Henceforth I will be thy guard by day and night, and will faithfully\r\nserve thee.\r\n\r\nAnd His-Augustness-Prince-Fire-Subside succeeded his father and dwelt in\r\nthe palace of Takachiho five hundred and eighty years. The place of his\r\ntomb is still shown on Mount Takachiho in the province of Hyūga of the\r\nisland of Kyūshū. And he left as his successor his son, whom the daughter\r\nof the Sea Deity had borne him. And this son was the father of\r\nHis-Augustness-Divine-Yamato-Iware-Prince, who is known to posterity by\r\nhis canonical name of Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. FOUNDING THE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the time when the movements which resulted in the\r\nestablishment of the empire of Japan took place. The events are still\r\noverlaid with myth and legend, which could only have been transmitted by\r\noral tradition. But they have to do with characters and places which are\r\ntied to the present by stronger cords than those of the divine age. What\r\nthe events really were which are involved in the myths of the preceding\r\nchapter it is impossible to predicate. That the celestial invasion of the\r\nisland of Kyūshū means the coming thither of a chief and his followers\r\nfrom the continent by way of Korea seems most reasonable. The\r\ninter-mixture of Izumo with these legends may mean that another migration\r\nof a kindred race took place to that part of the Main island. The easy\r\naccess to both Izumo and Kyūshū from Korea makes these migrations the\r\nnatural explanation of the landing of the Japanese upon these fertile and\r\ntempting islands.\r\n\r\nWithout settling the difficult ethnographical questions which are involved\r\nin this problem, we propose to follow the Kyūshū invaders into the Main\r\nisland. We will note the slow and laborious steps by which they proceeded\r\nto establish a government, which through many changes and emergencies\r\ncontinues to this day.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, whom we will continue to call Jimmu,(47) had an elder brother,\r\nPrince Itsu-se, who seems, however, to have been less active and energetic\r\nthan the younger. At least, even from the first it is Prince Jimmu who is\r\nrepresented as taking the initiative in the movements which were now\r\nbegun. The two brothers consulted together and resolved to conduct an\r\nexpedition towards the east. It will be remembered that their grandfather\r\nhad established his palace on Mount Takachiho, which is one of the two\r\nhighest peaks in Kyūshū, situated in the province of Hyūga, nearly in the\r\nmiddle of the southern extension of the island of Kyūshū. It was from this\r\nplace that the two brothers started on their expedition. It was no doubt\r\nsuch an expedition as the Norse Vikings of a later day often led into the\r\nislands of their neighbors. They had with them a force composed of the\r\ndescendants of the invaders who had come with their grandfather from the\r\ncontinent. They marched first through the country called Toyo, which was a\r\nluxuriant and fertile region on the northeast part of the island. Thence\r\nthey marched to the palace of Wokada, situated in a district of the island\r\nof Tsukushi, lying on the northwest coast facing Tsushima and the\r\npeninsula of Korea, and bordering on the straits of the Inland sea. Here\r\nthey remained a year and probably built the boats by which they crossed\r\nthe Inland sea.\r\n\r\nFrom Tsukushi they crossed to the province of Aki in the Main island on\r\nthe coast of the Inland sea, where it is said they remained seven years.\r\nThe progress seems like that of the hordes of the Goths in the early ages\r\nof European history. It was not merely a military expedition, but a\r\nmigration of a tribe with all its belongings, women and children, old men\r\nand old women, and household and agricultural effects. The military band\r\nunder Prince Jimmu and his brother formed the vanguard and protection of\r\nthe tribe. During their seven years’ sojourn in Aki they were compelled to\r\nresort to agriculture as well as fishing for their support.\r\n\r\nThen they skirted along the north coast of the Inland sea to Takashima in\r\nthe province of Kibi. Thence they crept with their awkward boats eastward\r\namong the luxuriant islands. They met a native of the coast out in his\r\nboat fishing and engaged his services as a guide. He conducted them to\r\nNaniwa, which now bears the name of Ōsaka, where they encountered the\r\nswift tides and rough sea which navigators still meet in this place.\r\nFinally they landed at a point which we cannot recognize, but which must\r\nhave been in the neighborhood of Ōsaka at the mouth of the Yodo river.\r\n\r\nHere their conflicts with the natives began. The whole region seems to\r\nhave been occupied by tribes not unlike their own, who had probably come\r\nthither from the settlements in Izumo. The first to dispute their progress\r\nwas Prince Nagasuné (Long Legs), of Tomi, who raised an army and resisted\r\nthe landing of the invaders. It was in the battle that ensued at this\r\nplace that Prince Itsu-se, the elder brother, received a wound in his hand\r\nfrom an arrow shot by Prince Nagasuné. The reason given reveals a curious\r\nsuperstition which seems to have prevailed from this early time. The\r\nJapanese prince on receiving the wound exclaims, “It is not right for me,\r\nan august child of the Sun Goddess, to fight facing the sun. It is for\r\nthis reason that I am stricken by the wretched villain’s hurtful hand.”\r\nPrince Itsu-se, after a few days, died from the effects of the wound. He\r\nis buried on mount Kama in the province of Kii.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to recount all the legends which cluster around this\r\ninvasion of the central provinces of Japan; about the wild boar which came\r\nout of the mountains near Kumano, before which Prince Jimmu and all his\r\nwarriors fell down in a faint; about the miraculous sword which was sent\r\ndown from the heavenly plains to aid him in subduing the\r\nCentral-Land-of-Reed-Plains; about a crow eight feet long which was sent\r\nto guide him in his expedition, and about the deities with tails who in\r\nseveral places were encountered. To our conception they seem meaningless,\r\nand do not in any measure contribute to the progress of the story. They\r\nbear evidence of a later invention, and do not belong legitimately to the\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nAt Uda, on the east coast of the Yamato peninsula, there lived two\r\nbrothers named Ukashi. The elder brother undertook to deceive Prince\r\nJimmu, and set a trap in which to capture and slay him. But the younger\r\nbrother revealed the plot, whereupon the followers of Prince Jimmu\r\ncompelled the traitor to retreat into his own trap, where they killed him.\r\nThe younger brother was honored and rewarded by Jimmu, and appears\r\nafterward among the hereditary princes of the country.\r\n\r\nAgain, as he was making his progress through the country Prince Jimmu came\r\nupon a company of the savages known as pit-dwellers,(48) whom the _Kojiki_\r\ncalls earth-spiders, and describes them as having tails. There appear to\r\nhave existed at this period remnants of these tribes as far south as the\r\n35th parallel. At a later period they were driven out by the Ainos, and\r\nnothing but some of their relics now exists, even in Yezo. The peculiarity\r\nby which they were known was, that they lived in a sort of pit dug out of\r\nthe earth in the sides of the mountains, over which they built a roof of\r\nlimbs and grass. In the present case there were eighty of the warriors of\r\nthis tribe. Prince Jimmu made a banquet for them in one of their pits and\r\nassigned an equal number of his own men to act as attendants. Each of\r\nthese attendants was girded with a sword. Then from a post outside he sang\r\na song,(49) and at a given signal in this song the eighty attendants fell\r\nupon the eighty earth-spiders and slew them all.\r\n\r\nThus having subdued all opposing forces and brought the country into\r\nsubjection, Prince Jimmu established himself in a palace built for him at\r\nKashiwara in the province of Yamato. This is usually regarded by Japanese\r\nhistorians as the beginning of the empire, and the present era(50) is\r\nreckoned from this establishment of a capital in Yamato. From the record\r\nof the length of the reigns of the several emperors contained in the\r\n_Kojiki_, and the _Nihongi_, and later books, the date of the accession of\r\nthe Emperor Jimmu is fixed at 660 B.C. We have given elsewhere(51) our\r\nreason for believing the record of the early reigns of doubtful\r\nauthenticity. Nevertheless, as it is impossible to propose a definite\r\nchange, it is better to use the accepted scheme with its admitted defects.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Jimmu after his accession continued to reign seventy-five\r\nyears and, according to the _Kojiki_, died at the age of one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven. The _Nihongi_, however, gives his age at death as one\r\nhundred and twenty-seven, and this has been adopted by the government in\r\nits published chronology.(52) His burial place is said to be on the\r\nnorthern side of mount Unebi in the province of Yamato. It is just to\r\nassign to the Emperor Jimmu the exalted place which the Japanese claim for\r\nhim in their history. That he was a prince of high enterprise is evident\r\nfrom his adventurous expedition from the home of his family into the\r\nbarbarous and unknown regions of the Main island. He accomplished its\r\nconquest with less slaughter and cruelty than the customs of the times\r\nseemed to justify. He made it his policy to effect terms with the native\r\nprinces and seek their co-operation in his government. He extended his\r\nsway so that it covered Anato, now known as Nagato, and Izumo on the west,\r\nand reached probably to Owari on the east. All this time he had held a\r\nfirm hand on the island from which he had come, so that few if any\r\noutbreaks occurred among its restless Turanian or native inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Jimmu was succeeded by his third son, known by his canonical\r\nname as the Emperor Suizei. The reigning emperor, it seems, exercised the\r\nright to select the son who should succeed him. This was not always the\r\noldest son, but from the time he was chosen he was known as _taishi_,\r\nwhich is nearly equivalent to the English term crown prince. The Emperor\r\nSuizei, it is said, occupied a palace at Takaoka, in Kazuraki, in the\r\nprovince of Yamato. This palace was not far from that occupied by his\r\nfather, yet it was not the same. And in the reigns of the successive\r\nsovereigns down to A.D. 709, when the capital was for a time established\r\nat Nara, we observe it as a most singular circumstance that each new\r\nemperor resided in a new palace. In the first place, the palace spoken of\r\nin these early times was probably a very simple structure. Mr. Satow, in\r\nhis paper(53) on the temples at Isé, gives an account of the form and\r\nconstruction of the prehistoric Japanese house. The Shintō temple in its\r\npure form is probably a survival of the original palace. Before the\r\nintroduction of edge-tools of iron and boring implements or nails, the\r\nbuilding must have been constructed in a very primitive fashion. It will\r\nbe understood that stone or brick were never used. Wood was the only\r\nmaterial for the frame. The roof was thatched with rushes or rice straw.\r\nThe pure Shintō temples of modern times are built with the utmost\r\nsimplicity and plainness. Although the occasion for adhering to primitive\r\nmethods has long since passed away, yet the buildings are conformed to the\r\nstyles of structure necessary before the introduction of modern tools and\r\nappliances. To build a new palace therefore for a new emperor involved by\r\nno means such an outlay of time and work as might be imagined.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that when a young man was chosen crown prince he had\r\nan establishment of his own assigned to him, and this became his palace\r\nwhich he occupied when he became emperor. When a man died, and especially\r\nwhen an emperor died, it was an ancient custom to abandon his abode. It\r\nbecame unclean by the presence in it of a dead body, and therefore was no\r\nlonger used.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              Shinto Temple\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is narrated of the immediate successors of the Emperor Jimmu of\r\nimportance to this story. The accounts contained in either of the oldest\r\nhistories relate merely to the genealogies of the several sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Suizei was, as we have seen, the third son of Jimmu and\r\nreigned thirty-two years, dying at the age of eighty-four.(54)\r\n\r\nThe third emperor was Annei, the only son of the Emperor Suizei. He\r\nreigned thirty-seven years and died at the age of fifty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe fourth emperor was Itoku, the oldest son of the Emperor Annei. He\r\nreigned thirty-three years and died at the age of seventy-seven.\r\n\r\nThe fifth emperor was Kōshō, the oldest son of the Emperor Itoku. He\r\nreigned eighty-two years and died at the age of one hundred and fourteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe sixth emperor was Kōan, the oldest son of the Emperor Kōshō. He\r\nreigned one hundred and one years and died at the age of one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe seventh emperor was Kōrei, the second son of the Emperor Kōan. He\r\nreigned seventy-five years and died at the age of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight.\r\n\r\nThe eighth emperor was Kōgen, the oldest son of the Emperor Kōrei. He\r\nreigned fifty-six years and died at the age of one hundred and sixteen.\r\n\r\nThe ninth emperor was Kaikwa, a younger son of the Emperor Kōgen. He\r\nreigned fifty-nine years and died at the age of one hundred and eleven.\r\n\r\nThe tenth emperor was Sūjin, a younger son of the Emperor Kaikwa. He\r\nreigned sixty-seven years and died at the age of one hundred and nineteen.\r\nIt is narrated that during his reign a pestilence broke out which was so\r\nsevere that the country was almost depopulated. The emperor was greatly\r\ndisturbed by this calamity, and there appeared to him in the night a\r\ndivine vision. The Great Deity, the Great Master of Things, appeared and\r\nrevealed to him, that if he would cause him to be appropriately worshipped\r\nthe pestilence would cease. The worship was accordingly ordained and\r\nexecuted, and the pestilence forthwith abated.\r\n\r\nIn this reign expeditions were also sent into the northwestern and\r\nnortheastern districts of the Main island to repress the disturbances\r\nwhich had arisen. The reports from these expeditions were in each case\r\nfavorable, and the whole empire was in a condition of quiet and\r\nprosperity, such as had not before existed. Taxes were for the first time\r\nlevied on the proceeds of the chase and on the handiwork of the women.\r\nReservoirs for the collection of water, used in the irrigation of the rice\r\ncrops, were constructed in the imperial provinces, and encouragement was\r\neverywhere given to the growing industries of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Sūjin was succeeded by his younger son who is known as the\r\neleventh emperor under the name of Suinin. He is said to have reigned\r\nninety-nine years, and to have died at the age of one hundred and\r\nforty-one.\r\n\r\nA conspiracy came near ending the life of this emperor. A brother of the\r\nempress was ambitious to attain supreme authority. He approached his\r\nsister with the subtle question, Which is dearer to thee, thine elder\r\nbrother or thy husband? She replied, My elder brother is dearer. Then he\r\nsaid, If I be truly the dearer to thee, let me and thee rule the empire.\r\nAnd he gave her a finely tempered dagger and said to her, Slay the emperor\r\nwith this in his sleep. So the emperor, unconscious of danger, was\r\nsleeping one day with his head on the lap of the empress. And she,\r\nthinking the time had come, was about to strike him with the dagger. But\r\nher courage failed her, and tears fell from her eyes on the face of the\r\nsleeping emperor. He started up, awakened by the falling tears, and said\r\nto her, I have had a strange dream. A violent shower came up from the\r\ndirection of Saho and suddenly wet my face. And a small damask-colored\r\nsnake coiled itself around my neck. What can such a dream betoken? Then\r\nthe empress, conscience-stricken, confessed the conspiracy with her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe emperor, knowing that no time was to be lost, immediately collected a\r\nforce of troops and marched against his brother-in-law. He had entrenched\r\nhimself behind palisades of timber and awaited the emperor’s attack. The\r\nempress, hesitating between her brother and her husband, had made her\r\nescape to her brother’s palace. At this terrible juncture she was\r\ndelivered of a child. She brought the child to the palisades in sight of\r\nthe emperor, and cried out to him to take it under his care. He was deeply\r\nmoved by her appeal to him and forthwith planned to rescue both the child\r\nand its mother. He chose from among his warriors a band of the bravest and\r\nmost cunning, and commanded them, saying, When ye go to take the child, be\r\nsure that ye seize also the mother.\r\n\r\nBut she, fearing that the soldiers would try to snatch her when they came\r\nfor the child, shaved off her hair and covered her head with the loose\r\nhair as if it were still adhering. And she made the jewel-strings around\r\nher neck and arms rotten, and she rendered her garments, by which they\r\nmight catch hold of her, tender by soaking them in _saké_. When the\r\nsoldiers came to her she gave them the child and fled. Then they seized\r\nher by the hair and it came away in their hands; and they clutched at the\r\njewel-strings and they broke; and then they grasped her garments, but they\r\nhad been rendered tender and gave way in their hands. So she escaped from\r\nthem and fled. Then they went back to the emperor and reported that they\r\nhad been unable to capture the mother, but they had brought the babe. The\r\nemperor was angry at what the soldiers told him. He was angry at the\r\njewellers who had made the rotten jewel-strings and deprived them of their\r\nlands. He called to the empress through the burning palisades around the\r\npalace—for the soldiers had set fire to the palace—saying, A child’s name\r\nmust be given by its mother; what shall be the name of this child? And she\r\nanswered, Let it be called Prince Homu-chiwake. And again he called: How\r\nshall he be reared? She replied, Take for him a foster-mother and bathing\r\nwoman who shall care for him. Then he asked again, saying: Who shall\r\nloosen the small, fresh pendant which you have tied upon him? And she gave\r\ndirections concerning this also. Then the emperor paused no longer, but\r\nslew the rebellious prince in his burning palace, and the empress perished\r\nwith her wicked brother.\r\n\r\nFollowing this is a long legend concerning this child which was dumb from\r\nits birth, and how he was sent to worship at the temple of the deities of\r\nIzumo, and how he miraculously attained the power of speech and was\r\nbrought back to his father.\r\n\r\nIt was during the reign of this emperor also that Tajima-mori was sent to\r\nChina to fetch specimens of the orange-tree for introduction into Japan.\r\nHe returned with them, but when he reached the capital the emperor was\r\ndead. The messenger was shocked and brought the specimens of the\r\norange-tree to the burial place of the emperor, where he died from grief.\r\n\r\nUp to this time it seems to have been the cruel custom to bury with the\r\ndeceased members of the imperial family, and perhaps with others of high\r\nrank, the living retainers and horses who had been in their service. It is\r\nsaid that when the emperor’s younger brother died (B.C. 2) they buried\r\nalong with him his living retainers, placing them upright in a circle\r\naround him and leaving their heads uncovered. Night and day were heard the\r\nagonizing cries of these thus left to die of starvation. The emperor was\r\ngreatly moved and resolved that this terrible custom should be abolished.\r\nFour years later the empress herself died, and the emperor called together\r\nhis counsellors to propose some plan by which this practice of living\r\nsacrifices could be avoided. Thereupon one of his counsellors,\r\nNomi-no-Sukuné, advanced and begged the emperor to listen to a scheme\r\nwhich he had to present. He suggested that, instead of burying the living\r\nretainers with their master or mistress, clay images of men and women and\r\nhorses be set up in a circle around the burial place. The plan pleased the\r\nemperor vastly, and images were at once made and buried around the dead\r\nempress. As a mark of his high appreciation Nomi-no-Sukuné was appointed\r\nchief of the clay-workers guild.\r\n\r\nIt appears probable that this cruel usage of burying living retainers with\r\ntheir dead master was not entirely ended by this substitution of clay\r\nimages. As late as A.D. 646 the emperor found it necessary to prescribe\r\nregulations for funerals and to forbid the burial of living retainers. Mr.\r\nSatow(55) has given a most interesting account of this edict which\r\npertains not only to the practice of burial of retainers, but also to the\r\nsize of vaults and mounds and the number of laborers who might be employed\r\nin preparing the structure.\r\n\r\nThe images used as a substitute for living retainers were called _Tsuchio\r\nNingio_ (clay images). They have been found in many parts of the country,\r\nespecially in the home provinces where the burial of the imperial families\r\nand the connected nobility took place. This burying of images seems to\r\nhave died out about A.D. 700. Its discontinuance probably was owing to the\r\ngrowing prevalence of Buddhism which discountenanced a custom founded on a\r\nreligion anterior to it.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              Buried Images\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Suinin was succeeded by his younger son Keikō who became the\r\ntwelfth emperor. He reigned fifty-nine years, and died at the age of one\r\nhundred and forty-three. His son, Prince O-usu, who afterward was known as\r\nYamato-dake, is represented as pursuing a most daring and romantic career.\r\nThe myths concerning him are among the most picturesque in Japanese\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe first adventure narrated of him was regarding his elder brother. His\r\nfather asked him, Why does not thy elder brother make his appearance at\r\nthe imperial banquets? Do thou see after this and teach him his duty.\r\n\r\nA few days after his father said again to him, Why dost not thy brother\r\nattend to his duty? Hast thou not warned him as I bade thee?\r\n\r\nThe young prince replied that he had taken that trouble. Then his father\r\nsaid, How didst thou take the trouble to warn him? And the prince coolly\r\ntold him that he had slain him and thrown his carcass away.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was alarmed at the coolness and ferocity of his son, and\r\nbethought how he might employ him advantageously. Now there were at Kumaso\r\nin Kyūshū two brothers, fierce and rebellious bandits, who paid small\r\nrespect to the imperial wishes. The emperor conceived that it would be a\r\nfitting achievement for his fearless son to put an end to these reckless\r\noutlaws. So Yamato-dake borrowed from his aunt her female apparel, and\r\nhiding a sword in the bosom of his dress, he sought out the two outlaws in\r\ntheir hiding-place. They were about to celebrate the occupancy of a new\r\ncave which they had fitted up for themselves. They had invited a goodly\r\nnumber of their neighbors, and especially of the female sex. Prince\r\nYamato-dake, who was young and fresh-looking, put on his female disguise\r\nand let down his hair which was still long. He sauntered about the cave\r\nand went in where the two outlaws were amusing themselves with their\r\nfemale visitors. They were surprised and delighted to see this new and\r\nbeautiful face. They seated her between them and did their best to\r\nentertain her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, when the outlaws were off their guard, he drew his sword from\r\nhis bosom and slew the elder brother. The younger rushed out of the door\r\nof the cave, the prince close at his heels. With one hand he clutched him\r\nby the back and with the other thrust him through with his sword. As he\r\nfell he begged the prince to pause a moment and not to withdraw his sword\r\nfrom his fatal wound.\r\n\r\nThen the outlaw said, Who art thou? And he told him and for what purpose\r\nhe had come.\r\n\r\nThe outlaw said, There were in the west none so brave as we two brothers.\r\nFrom this time forward it shall be right to praise thee as the August\r\nChild Yamato-dake (the bravest in Yamato).\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had said this, the prince “ripped him up like a ripe\r\nmelon.”(56)\r\n\r\nThen after he had subdued and pacified the rebellious princes of the\r\ndistricts about the straits of Shimonoseki he returned to the emperor and\r\nmade his report.\r\n\r\nFollowing this account of Yamato-dake’s adventures in the West, there are\r\ngiven the interesting traditions concerning his expedition to the East,\r\nand his encounters with the Ainos, who inhabited the northern part of the\r\nisland. That there was a basis of fact to these traditions there cannot be\r\na doubt. Yet the events have such an air of fable and poetry that it is\r\nimpossible to separate the fact from the legend. As we have done in\r\nprevious instances, we give the stories in their essential entirety,\r\nleaving to scholars hereafter the task of winnowing the grains of fact out\r\nof the chaff which the imagination of the race has left for us.\r\n\r\nPrince Yamato-dake took on his expedition to the East the Prince\r\nMi-suki-tomo-mimi-take. The emperor gave him these instructions: “Subdue\r\nand pacify the savage deities, and likewise the unsubmissive people of the\r\ntwelve roads(57) of the East.”\r\n\r\nPrince Yamato-dake first visited the temple of the Sun Goddess in Isé,\r\nwhere he worshipped at the shrine of his great ancestress. He must have\r\nhad a presentiment that he never would return alive from this expedition.\r\nHis aunt Yamato-hime,(58) who was the priestess of this temple, gave him\r\non his departure the sword(59) which the Impetuous-Male-Deity discovered\r\nin the tail of the snake which he slew in Izumo. She also gave him a bag\r\nwhich he was not to open until he found himself in pressing difficulty.\r\n\r\nHe came to the land of Owari, and appears there to have been smitten by\r\nthe charms of the Princess Miyazu. And, planning to wed her on his way\r\nback, he plighted to her his troth and went on. Then he came to the\r\nprovince of Sagami, where he met the chief of the land. But he deceived\r\nhim and said that in the midst of a vast moor there is a lagoon where\r\nlives a deity. Yamato-dake went over the moor to find the deity. Whereupon\r\nthe chief set fire to the grass, expecting to see him consumed. But\r\nYamato-dake seeing his danger, and being assured that the time of pressing\r\ndifficulty had come, opened the bag which his aunt, Yamato-hime, had given\r\nhim. There he found a fire drill,(60) with which a fire could be struck.\r\nHe cut away the grass around him with the sword which had been given him,\r\nand then set fire to the moor. When he was safe from the fire he sought\r\nout and slew the traitorous chief and all the chiefs who were associated\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nFrom Sagami he undertook to cross in a boat the waters of Yedo bay to\r\nKazusa opposite. But the sea was rough and they were on the point of being\r\noverwhelmed and drowned. Then his wife, the Princess Oto-Tachibana, who\r\naccompanied him on this expedition, threw out mats from the boat, and\r\nsaying, “I will enter the sea instead of the prince; you must finish the\r\ntask on which you are sent,” she sprang from the boat and sat down on the\r\nmats(61) she had thrown out. Immediately the waves were quiet and the boat\r\nsailed on in safety. And the comb of the princess was washed ashore, and\r\nthe people built for it a sacred mausoleum in which it was kept.\r\n\r\nThen Prince Yamato-dake penetrated the regions occupied by the Ainos(62)\r\nand subdued them. Having accomplished this principal object of his\r\nundertaking, he returned by way of the Usui pass opposite to mount Fuji.\r\nAs he stood in this lofty position and looked out on the sea where his\r\nwife had sacrificed herself for his safety, he cried out: “Azuma ha ya!”\r\n(O my wife!) Azuma is a name often used in poetry for the part of Japan\r\nnorth of this pass. But whether this myth was invented to explain the\r\nname, or the name was derived from the incident, it is impossible to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nThen Prince Yomato-dake went into the high lands of Shinano and after he\r\nhad settled the disturbances which existed there, he came back to Owari\r\nwhere he had left the Princess Miyazu. In one of his excursions into the\r\nrebellious regions he was stricken with a fatal illness. In his enfeebled\r\ncondition he struggled on, almost unable to walk. He made his way towards\r\nIsé. At Ōtsu, a village on the coast of Owari bay, he recovered the sword\r\nwhich he had left on his way to the East. In his painful journey he sat\r\ndown under a pine tree. The spirit of poesy even in his pain came upon him\r\nand he sang this little poem(63) in praise of the pine tree:\r\n\r\n\r\n    O mine elder brother, the single pine tree\r\n    That art on cape Ōtsu, which directly faces Owari!\r\n    If thou single pine tree! wert a person,\r\n    I would gird my sword upon thee,\r\n    I would clothe thee with my garments,—\r\n    O mine elder brother, the single pine tree!\r\n\r\n\r\nHe went on a little farther to Nobono and his sickness became more\r\nserious. And there in the open fields he felt that his end had come. He\r\nsent the spoils of his expedition to the temple of his great ancestress,\r\nthe Sun Goddess. He sent his faithful companion Prince Kibi-no-Takehito to\r\nthe emperor to carry his last message. It was: “I have chastised the\r\neastern barbarians according to your imperial order with the help of the\r\ngods and with your imperial influence. I hoped to return in triumph with\r\nmy weapons wrapped in white. But I have been seized with a mortal disease,\r\nand I cannot recover. I am lying in the sweet open fields. I do not care\r\nfor my life. I only regret that I cannot live to appear before thee and\r\nmake my report of my expedition.”\r\n\r\nAnd he died in the thirty-second year of his age. And they buried him\r\nthere and built a mausoleum over his remains. The emperor lamented the\r\ndeath of his gallant and immortal son, and made an imperial progress into\r\nthe regions which he had conquered and pacified.\r\n\r\nThe successor to the Emperor Keikō was known by the canonical name of\r\nSeimu. He was the thirteenth emperor, and was the grandson of his\r\npredecessor, having been a son of the hero Yamato-dake who was the crown\r\nprince until his death. The Emperor Seimu reigned fifty-nine years and\r\ndied at the age of one hundred and eight. Nothing noteworthy is narrated\r\nof his reign.\r\n\r\nHis successor, the fourteenth emperor, was Chūai, his eldest son. He\r\nreigned only eight years and died at the age of fifty-two. It is\r\nremarkable that his capital was in the island of Kyūshū and not in the\r\nMain island, like his predecessors from the time of the Emperor Jimmu.\r\nThis removal was probably due to the preparations which had already begun\r\nfor the invasion of Korea. The island of Kyūshū is most favorably situated\r\nfor the preparation and sailing of such an expedition. The wife of this\r\nemperor was Jingō-Kōgō, who was a much more forcible and energetic\r\ncharacter than her husband.\r\n\r\nShe is one of the heroines around whom much tradition has gathered, and\r\nher successful invasion of Korea is an event which the Japanese writers\r\nand artists are never tired of representing. The legend—for undoubtedly\r\nmuch of the story is legendary—is essentially as follows:\r\n\r\nThe emperor was busy in Kyūshū in reducing to subjection the tribes of the\r\nKumaso who inhabited the southern portion of the island. Up to this time\r\nthese restless tribes had given much trouble to the empire and expeditions\r\nwere constantly needed to keep them in order. They were unquestionably of\r\na kindred race with the Japanese who accompanied the Emperor Jimmu into\r\nthe Main island. The empress, afterward known as Jingō-Kōgō and the\r\nfaithful prime-minister Take-no-uchi(64) were at their temporary palace at\r\nKashihi. The empress in an interview on the campaign became divinely\r\npossessed. And she spoke to the emperor in the name of the deity that\r\npossessed her saying, “There is a land at the westward, and in that land\r\nthere is abundance of various treasures dazzling to the eye, from gold and\r\nsilver downwards. I will now bestow this land upon thee.”\r\n\r\nThen the emperor replied, “If you ascend to a high place and look\r\nwestward, no country is to be seen; there is only the great sea.” And he\r\npushed away the lute upon which he was playing and said, “They are lying\r\ndeities which have spoken to you.” Then the deity was very angry and spoke\r\nagain through the empress. “This empire is not a land over which thou art\r\nfit to rule. Go thou the one road.”\r\n\r\nThe prime-minister Take-no-uchi then said to the emperor, “I am filled\r\nwith awe, my heavenly sovereign, at this fearful message. I pray thee\r\ncontinue playing thy august lute.” Then he played softly; and gradually\r\nthe sound died away and all was still. And they took a light and looking\r\nin his face, behold he was dead.\r\n\r\nThe empress and the prime-minister Take-no-uchi concealed for the time the\r\ndeath of the emperor, and she herself proceeded to carry out the plan for\r\nthe invasion of Korea. With indefatigable energy she gathered her forces\r\nand equipped a fleet for the descent upon Korea. She set out from Wani in\r\nKyūshū in the tenth month of the year A.D. 202. Even the fish of the sea\r\nwere her allies, for with one accord they bore the ship in which she\r\nsailed across the intervening straits on their backs.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Japanese was a complete surprise to the people of Korea.\r\nAt this time the peninsula now known to us as Korea and to the Japanese as\r\nChōsen, was divided into three kingdoms, Kōrai, Shiraki, and Kudara. The\r\nfleet of Jingō-Kōgō landed in the kingdom of Shiraki. The king was so\r\ncompletely unprepared for this incursion that he at once offered his\r\nsubjection and proposed to become a tributary kingdom. The proposition was\r\naccepted. The kings of Kōrai and Kudara made similar proposals which also\r\nwere accepted. Each was to make an immediate contribution to the empress,\r\nand annually thereafter to send tribute to the capital of Japan. Thus they\r\nbecame the three tributary countries (_sankan_) dependent on Japan.\r\nAlthough this invasion of a foreign country without cause or provocation\r\nmust be pronounced indefensible, yet it is not unlikely that the subject\r\nkingdoms were quite as safe and free under the distant and little\r\nintermeddlesome dominion of the Japanese empire, as they had been in the\r\npast or were likely to be in the future from their troublesome neighbors,\r\nChina and the restless Mongolian tribes. To Japan the connection with the\r\ncontinent was of momentous value. It opened up a natural and easy way for\r\nthe influx of those continental influences which were to be of so great\r\nservice in their future history.\r\n\r\nThe empress, having within three years completely accomplished the object\r\nof her expedition, returned with her fleet to Kyūshū. She brought back\r\nwith her hostages from the conquered kingdoms, to ensure their fulfilment\r\nof the promises they had made. She had learned many lessons of government\r\nwhich she was not slow to introduce into her administration at home. Soon\r\nafter reaching Kyūshū she was delivered of the son of whom she was\r\npregnant at the time of the death of the emperor, and who afterwards\r\nbecame the Emperor Ōjin.\r\n\r\nThe object which she and her faithful prime-minister had in concealing the\r\ndeath of the emperor was accomplished. They now made the fact public, and\r\nproclaimed her own son as her successor. Two older sons of Chūai by\r\nanother empress were unwilling to submit to the rule of a younger brother.\r\nBut the Empress Jingō, who had now become a national idol by her Korean\r\nexpedition, soon put down the conspiracy of these princes and reigned till\r\nthe end of her life and left a quiet succession to her son.\r\n\r\nShe is said to have reigned as empress-regent(65) sixty-eight years, and\r\nto have died at the age of one hundred.\r\n\r\nHer son became the fifteenth emperor and is known by the canonical name of\r\nŌjin. He commenced his reign in the year A.D. 270, and reigned forty years\r\nand died at the age of one hundred and ten. But the beginning of his reign\r\nis reckoned in the government list from the death of his father. The\r\nEmperor Ōjin is widely worshipped as Hachiman the god of war, although he\r\nis by no means noted as a warrior. The explanation of this curious\r\ncircumstance is found in the fact that his mother was pregnant with him\r\nduring her famous invasion of Korea, and her heroism and success are\r\nattributed to the martial character of her unborn son.\r\n\r\nThe good fruits of the Korean conquest particularly showed themselves in\r\nA.D. 284, when the king of Kudara sent his usual tribute to the emperor of\r\nJapan. The ambassador for that year was Ajiki, a learned man who was\r\nfamiliar with Chinese literature. At the request of the emperor he gave\r\nthe young prince, who afterwards became the Emperor Nintoku, lessons in\r\nthe Chinese language and literature. The year following the king of Kudara\r\nseeing how much his efforts to furnish Chinese learning were appreciated,\r\nsent an eminent Chinese scholar, Wani, who took with him the _Confucian\r\nAnalects_ and the _Thousand Character Essay_, two noted Chinese classics\r\nand presented them to the emperor. The prince continued his studies under\r\nWani and became a very learned man.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had three sons between whom he wished to divide his authority,\r\nwishing however to establish his youngest son as the crown prince and his\r\nsuccessor. He summoned them before him and put this question to the elder,\r\n“Which should be preferred, a younger son or an older?” Then the elder son\r\nreplied that he thought the older son should be preferred. But the emperor\r\nturned to the second son and asked him the same question. He replied that\r\nas the older son was more grown and less of a care, he thought the younger\r\nson would be more of a favorite. The emperor was pleased with this reply\r\nbecause it coincided with his own sentiment. He created his youngest son,\r\nPrince Waka-iratsu, the crown prince and ordered his second son, Prince\r\nOsasagi, to assist him. He gave the charge of the mountains, rivers,\r\nforests, fields, etc. to his eldest son.\r\n\r\nSo when the Emperor Ōjin died A.D. 310, the younger son urged his brother\r\nto accept the imperial power; but he declined, saying: “How can I disobey\r\nthe commands of my father?” The oldest of the three brothers, learning of\r\nthe controversy, undertook to secure the authority for himself by a plot.\r\nThe conspiracy was, however, soon put down and the elder brother slain.\r\nThe friendly dispute between the two other brothers lasted three years and\r\nwas finally ended by the younger committing suicide, and thus devolving\r\nthe imperial office on his remaining brother. This brother was the noted\r\nEmperor Nintoku. He began his reign in the year A.D. 313, and died A.D.\r\n399 in the one hundred and tenth year of his age. He was a most careful\r\nand considerate ruler. By observing his subjects he was convinced that\r\nthey were overburdened and impoverished with the taxes which the\r\ngovernment collected from them. So he announced by an imperial decree that\r\nfor three years all taxes should be remitted. Even the sums which were\r\nnecessary to keep the palace in repair and to provide his court with\r\nsuitable clothing were not collected. And the palace grew shabby, and its\r\nroof leaked, and he himself went about in coarse and cheap garments. And\r\nthe farmers came to him and begged that they might contribute to his\r\nwants. But he refused, and suffered three years to pass. In the meantime\r\nthe country revived, and the farmers being relieved from the burdens which\r\nthey had so long borne entered on a long period of encouraging prosperity.\r\nHe surveyed the land from a high outlook, and saw the curling smoke and\r\nthe fertile fields and rejoiced. Then he gave commands, and the taxes were\r\nrenewed, and the people paid them willingly, and they in their gratitude\r\ncalled Nintoku the Sage Emperor.\r\n\r\nIt was in the reign of the Emperor Nintoku that the noted prime-minister\r\nPrince Take-no-uchi is said to have died. He had served six emperors,\r\nviz.: Keikō, Seimu, Chūai, Jingō-Kōgō, Ōjin, and Nintoku. His age(66) is\r\ngiven variously from two hundred and eighty-two to three hundred and\r\neighty, in different books, one of which is a Chinese work and one a\r\nKorean. It will be remembered that he was the chief adviser of the warlike\r\nEmpress Jingō in her invasion of Korea, and took an active part in the\r\nevents which followed that expedition. That there was such a figure in\r\nJapanese history there can be little doubt, but that much of his life and\r\nthe great age to which he lived are like many of the stories of the\r\ncharacters in the midst of which he lived, legendary and mythical, no one\r\ncan question.\r\n\r\nIt was in this reign also that we have it stated that historiographers\r\nwere sent out to the provinces and directed to make record of all\r\nimportant events and forward them to the court.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a point in Japanese history where the accounts\r\ncompiled by the historians of the times have written records on which to\r\nrely. The legendary and marvellous stories which have been the bulk of the\r\npreceding history may now be replaced by the soberer narrations which\r\nwriting has preserved for us. It will be seen that the lives(67) of the\r\nemperors now drop from the astonishing age which in previous years they\r\nattained to a very moderate and reasonable length. In the subsequent\r\nchapters will be found the sober and chastened story to which Japanese\r\nhistory is henceforth reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. NATIVE CULTURE AND CONTINENTAL INFLUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore going on to the meagre story which is supplied to us by the early\r\nyears of Japanese history, it will be well to glean from the myths and\r\nlegends which tradition has preserved the lessons which they contain.\r\nAlthough we may be unable to concede the truth of these traditions in\r\ntheir entirety, and believe in the celestial origin of the race and the\r\nwonders of the divine age, we may be able to obtain from them many\r\nimportant facts regarding the habits and manner of life of the early\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nWe have often referred to the admirable work Mr. Chamberlain has done in\r\nhis translation of the _Kojiki_, and in the scholarly notes he has added.\r\nBut in our present enquiries we must give him still greater credit for the\r\nimportant lessons which he has drawn from the myths and legends of the\r\n_Kojiki_ in his learned introduction. No writer at the present day can\r\nafford to dispense with the deductions which he has been able to draw from\r\nthe oldest writings of the Japanese, and from the traditions of an older\r\ndate which these writings have preserved. Relying therefore chiefly on\r\nthis learned introduction,(68) we propose to enumerate in a summary manner\r\nthe particulars concerning the early Japanese life.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the government of the early Japanese was of the tribal\r\norder. The emperor was the chieftain of an expedition which came from the\r\nisland of Kyūshū and established a government by conquest. The chiefs of\r\nthe various localities were reduced to subjection and became tributary to\r\nthe emperor, or were replaced by new chiefs appointed by the emperor. The\r\ngovernment was therefore essentially feudal in its characteristics. The\r\nemperor depended for the consideration of his plans and for their\r\nexecution upon officers who were attached to his court. There were guilds\r\ncomposed of those who manufactured various articles, or who were employed\r\nto execute special plans. Thus we have guilds of clay image makers, guilds\r\nof ladies attendant on the emperor, guilds of butlers, guilds of cooks,\r\nguilds of guards, etc. To each of these there was a captain who became by\r\nappointment hereditary chief. We have no mention of money for the payment\r\nof services rendered. The taxes were probably paid in kind. And all\r\ntransactions as far as they are mentioned at all seem to have been of the\r\nnature of barter.\r\n\r\nThe religious notions of the prehistoric Japanese were founded on the\r\nmyths relating to their ancestor. Notwithstanding the vast number of\r\ndeities who came into existence according to tradition, most of them\r\nvanish as soon as they are named and are no more heard of. Even deities\r\nlike Izanagi and Izanami, who are represented as taking so important a\r\npart in events, are not perpetuated as objects of worship in Japanese\r\nhistory, and have no temples erected to their memory and no service\r\nprescribed or maintained in their honor. The most important deity in the\r\nPantheon of the Japanese was Amaterasu-ō-mi-kami, who is also called in\r\nChinese characters Tensho Daijin or the Sun Goddess. She appears not only\r\nin the myths concerning the origin of the Japanese race, but as the\r\ngrandmother of the divine prince Hiko-ho-no-ni-nigi, who first came down\r\nto rule the Japanese empire. In the Shintō temples at Isé the principal\r\ndeity worshipped at Gekū is Uké-moche-no-Kami, and the secondary deities\r\nNinigi-no-Mikoto, who came down to found the Japanese empire and was the\r\ngrandmother of the Emperor Jimmu, and two others. At the Naikū the\r\nprincipal deity is Amaterasu-ō-mi-kami (from heaven shining great deity),\r\nalso called the Sun Goddess, and two secondary deities. The temples at\r\nIsé, especially those that are dedicated to the Sun Goddess, are the most\r\nhighly regarded of any in Japan. Other temples of considerable popularity\r\nare situated in other parts of the empire. Thus there are Shintō temples\r\nin Kyūshū and in Izumo, which are old parts of Japan settled long before\r\nBuddhism was introduced.\r\n\r\nThe Shintō religion must be regarded as the primitive religion of the\r\nJapanese people. It prevailed among them long before Buddhism was\r\npropagated by priests from Korea. It differs from all known systems of\r\nreligion, in having no body of dogma by which its adherents are held\r\ntogether. The greatest advocate of Shintoism, Moto-ori, a writer of the\r\n18th century, admits that it has no moral code. He asserts that\r\n“morals(69) were invented by the Chinese because they were an immoral\r\npeople, but in Japan there was no necessity for any system of morals, as\r\nevery Japanese acted rightly if he only consulted his own heart.”\r\n\r\nReference is frequently made in the early stories to divination, or the\r\nprocess of obtaining the will of the gods by indirection. The oldest\r\nmethod of divination was by using the shoulder-blade of a deer. It was\r\nscraped entirely free from flesh, and then placed over a fire made from\r\ncherry wood. The divine will was determined by the cracks caused by the\r\nfire in the bone. A later method of divination was by using the shell of a\r\ntortoise in the same way as the shoulder-blade of the deer was used. They\r\nhad superstitions about fighting with the back to the sun; about using\r\nonly one light in the house at once; about breaking off the teeth of a\r\ncomb in the night-time; about the destination of the first arrow shot in\r\nbattle, etc.\r\n\r\nThe superstition of impurity being attached to the mother at the birth of\r\na child, and to the house and those associated with it in which a death\r\noccurred, is often mentioned. A mother, when about to be delivered, was\r\nrequired to retire alone into a separate dwelling or hut without windows.\r\nThis cruel custom has prevailed in the island of Hachijō(70) down almost\r\nto the present time. A custom prevailed, also, of abandoning the dwelling\r\nin which a death had occurred. The dead body was removed to a mourning\r\nhut, where amid sobs and weeping the mourners continued to hold a\r\ncarousal, feasting upon the food provided for the dead. This abandonment\r\nof the house occupied by the living may explain the custom, so often\r\nreferred to, of each new emperor occupying a different palace from that of\r\nhis predecessor. We have already referred to the dreadful custom which\r\nprevailed until the reign of the Emperor Suinin, of burying living\r\nretainers around the sepulchre of their dead master. The custom was\r\nreplaced by burying clay images of servants and animals around the tomb,\r\nand this continued till about A.D. 700.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that children received any kind of education other\r\nthan a training in the use of arms and implements. The art of writing was\r\nbrought over from Korea in A.D. 284. Up to this time there is nothing to\r\nshow that the Japanese possessed any means of recording the events which\r\noccurred. No books existed, and reading and writing were unknown. The\r\nlanguage spoken by the people was an ancient form of that which now\r\nprevails. The earliest examples of this language are found in the songs\r\npreserved in the _Kojiki_ and _Nihongi_. As in every language, the\r\nearliest preserved specimens are poetry, so in Japanese the fragments\r\nwhich have been remembered and brought down to us, are scraps of songs.\r\nThe origin of this language is, like the origin of the race, impossible at\r\npresent to verify. It seems plain that the race came from the continent by\r\nway of Korea. If this is to be taken as the origin of the race, then the\r\nlanguage which developed into the Japanese came from the northern tribes\r\nof China and of Siberia.\r\n\r\nThere is no indication of the method by which the early Japanese reckoned\r\ntime. The sun in the daytime and the cocks by night, must have given them\r\ntheir division of hours. The year made itself apparent by the changes of\r\ntemperature. It was not, however, till the introduction of calendars from\r\nChina that anything like an accurate system of estimating and recording\r\ntime was introduced.\r\n\r\nThe food of the primitive Japanese was much more largely animal than it\r\nbecame in later times. To the early Japanese there was no restriction in\r\nthe use of animal food, such as the Buddhists introduced. Fish and\r\nshell-fish have always been, and doubtless from the first were, principal\r\narticles of food. The five grains, so called, are often referred to, and\r\nare specially mentioned in the Shintō rituals, whose origin goes back to\r\nprehistoric times. These grains(71) are rice, millet, barley, and two\r\nkinds of beans. Silkworms and their food plant, the mulberry, are likewise\r\nspoken of. The only kind of drink referred to is _saké_. It will be\r\nremembered that in the myth concerning the Impetuous Male Deity in Izumo,\r\nthe old man and old woman were directed to prepare eight tubs of _saké_,\r\nby drinking which the eight-headed serpent was intoxicated. In the\r\ntraditional history of the emperors, they are represented as drinking\r\n_saké_, sometimes even to intoxication. And in the rituals recited when\r\nofferings are made to their deities, the jars of _saké_ are enumerated\r\namong the things offered. The Japanese writers claim that _saké_ was a\r\nnative discovery, but there is a well supported belief that in very early\r\ntimes they borrowed the art of manufacturing it from the Chinese. There is\r\nat least a difficulty in believing that this liquor should have been\r\ninvented independently in the two countries. Chopsticks are mentioned in\r\nearly Japanese times, and clay vessels for food, and cups for drinking\r\nmade of oak leaves. On the whole, the conclusions to be drawn from the\r\nearliest traditions concerning the Japanese lead us to regard them as\r\nhaving attained a material degree of civilization in all matters\r\npertaining to food and drink. Yet it cannot be regarded as other than\r\nstrange that milk, cheese and butter are nowhere mentioned, and had never\r\nbeen used.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of clothing we have little except hints to guide us in\r\nforming inferences. The rituals enumerate(72) “bright cloth, soft cloth,\r\nand coarse cloth.” Mr. Satow remarks(73) on this enumeration that “in the\r\nearliest ages the materials used were the bark of the paper-mulberry\r\n(_broussonetia papyrifera_), wistaria tendrils and hemp, but when the\r\nsilkworm was introduced the finer fabric naturally took the place of the\r\nhumbler in the offerings to the gods.” The paper-mulberry which is now\r\nused for making paper, was in early times twisted into a thread and woven\r\ninto a very serviceable cloth. Cotton(74) which now furnishes so large a\r\npart of the clothing of the people is nowhere mentioned. The skins of\r\nanimals were doubtless used as clothing before the introduction of\r\nBuddhism made the killing of animals uncommon. In the legend of the\r\npurification of Izanagi(75) we read of a girdle, of a skirt, of an upper\r\ngarment, of trousers, and of a hat. What the shapes of these garments were\r\nwe cannot tell, but the number of different garments indicates a\r\nconsiderable development in the ideas of clothing. In the same myth, and\r\nin many other places, mention is made of the bracelets which Izanagi wore\r\non the left and right arm. And when he wished to show his pleasure in the\r\ndaughter who had been produced in washing his left eye, he invested her\r\nwith his necklace taken from his own neck. Jewelry seems in these\r\nprehistoric times to have been more commonly worn than in modern\r\nhistorical times. The jewels(76) used were the _magatama_ and _kudatama_\r\nwhich have been found in the ancient burial places.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          Magatama and Kudatama.\r\n\r\n\r\nRings have also been found which are believed to date back to prehistoric\r\ntimes. From the clay images which have come down to us it is now\r\nascertained that the rings were worn as ornaments to the ears and never as\r\nrings to the fingers. These rings are of copper or bronze, plated with\r\ngold or silver. Combs and mirrors are spoken of, but how the metal mirrors\r\nare made we do not know.\r\n\r\nThe only indications of the character of the houses(77) used by the early\r\nJapanese are found in the traditions respecting the primitive Shintō\r\ntemples. The early methods of building were perpetuated in these temples,\r\nand in the eighteenth century a very persistent effort was made for the\r\nrevival of pure Shintō. Under the influence of this movement the temples\r\nat Isé and elsewhere were purified from the contaminations which had been\r\nintroduced by Buddhism. After the close of the war which resulted in the\r\nrestoration of the emperor to his proper authority in 1868 a small temple\r\nin the most severe Shintō style was built at Kudan, one of the picturesque\r\nheights of Yedo, in memory of the soldiers who perished in the conflict.\r\nFrom a careful examination of all that can illustrate the houses of the\r\nearly Japanese, we infer that they were of extreme simplicity. Stone was\r\nnever used. The structures were entirely of wood. Even the palaces of the\r\nemperors were what we would call merely huts. Four upright posts sunk in\r\nthe ground formed the corners. At the half-way intervals between these\r\nposts, were planted four other posts; those at the gable ends were high\r\nenough to sustain the ridge pole. On the other sides on the top of the\r\nposts were laid two plates. Abutting on these plates and crossing each\r\nother at the ridge pole stood the rafters, which sustained the thatched\r\nroof. In the absence of nails and pins, the timbers were fastened together\r\nby the tough tendrils of climbing plants. A hole in the gable end\r\npermitted the escape of the smoke from the fire built on the ground floor.\r\nAround the sides of the interior stood a raised couch on which the\r\noccupants sat by day and slept at night. The other parts of the floor were\r\nuncovered and consisted only of earth. They used mats made from the skins\r\nof animals or from rushes, on which they sat and slept. The doors of their\r\ndwellings were fastened by means of iron hooks, and swung on hinges unlike\r\nthe modern Japanese door which always is made to slide.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural plants spoken of are numerous but leave unmentioned many\r\nof the plants of first importance. Tea, now so extensively cultivated, is\r\nnowhere spoken of. Tobacco was a late importation and came in with the\r\nPortuguese in the sixteenth century. Cotton was not introduced, as we have\r\nalready said, until the beginning of the ninth century. Potatoes,\r\nincluding both the sweet potato and the white potato, are unmentioned. The\r\norange came to Japan according to the received tradition at the close of\r\nthe reign of the Emperor Suinin (A.D. 29-70).\r\n\r\nVery little is said of the implements used by the primitive Japanese.\r\nMetal of any kind was almost unknown. We read of swords and fish-hooks,\r\nbut these are the only implements referred to which seem to have been made\r\nof metal. Pots and cups of earthenware were used. The axes which they must\r\nhave used to cut down the trees for building and for fuel must have been\r\nof stone, or sometimes of deer’s horn. Archæologists both native and\r\nforeign have brought to light many ancient implements of the Stone age. An\r\ninteresting and detailed account of these discoveries will be found in the\r\nwork on _Japanese Archæology_ by Henry Von Siebold, Yokohoma, 1879.\r\n\r\nThe arms used by the warriors were spears, bows and arrows, and swords.\r\nNumerous arrow heads have been found which bear a striking likeness to\r\nthose found in Europe and America. Spear heads of flint have also been\r\nfound. That the people were emerging from the Stone age is shown by the\r\nswords made of metal which they are represented as habitually using. They\r\nalso seem to have had a small sword or dagger, as in the myth of the\r\ntraitorous plot entered into by the empress and her brother against the\r\nEmperor Suinin. Castles in the modern sense are not referred to, although\r\nthe same word _shiro_ is used to represent the stockades with which they\r\nprotected themselves. The castles of modern times, such as those at\r\nKumamoto, Owari, and Yedo, are without doubt the outgrowth of the\r\nprimitive stockade, and the same name has continued to be applied in all\r\nthe successive changes.\r\n\r\nFew domestic animals are mentioned. The horse is spoken of as an animal\r\nfor riding, but not for driving. The same thing may be said of the use of\r\nhorses in Japan even until modern times. The domestic fowl is referred to\r\nin the myth of the disappearance of the Sun Goddess. Dogs are mentioned in\r\nthe later parts of the traditional period, but not cats. The cow and the\r\nproducts of the cow are not referred to. To these domestic animals may be\r\nadded the cormorant,(78) which was used for fishing, in the same way that\r\nit is used in the eastern parts of China and to a small extent in the\r\nwaters of Owari and Mino at the present time. The wild animals of that day\r\nwere the deer, the bear, the boar, the hare, etc. These animals were\r\nhunted for their flesh and for their skins.\r\n\r\nThe islands of Japan being largely interspersed with water much of the\r\ntravel even from the earliest time was performed in boats. The expedition\r\nof Jimmu from the island of Kyūshū was in part conducted in the boats\r\nwhich the colony had constructed for the purpose. Whether these boats were\r\nof the form now used in Japan it is impossible to determine. It is\r\nprobable however that the present form of boat is an evolution of the\r\nprimitive boat, which was used by the prehistoric Japanese and which was a\r\npart of the equipment with which their ancestors came over from Korea to\r\nthe islands of Japan. Travel on land was principally on foot, although as\r\nwe have said the horse was used at this early day for riding. No wheeled\r\nvehicle is mentioned. The bullock cart used in later times was restricted\r\nto the use of the imperial household, and probably was introduced by the\r\nBuddhists. There were government roads constructed from the home provinces\r\nin different directions to those more distant. It is said that this scheme\r\nwas more fully carried out after the return of the Empress Jingō from her\r\nconquest of Korea.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from these evidences of native culture to the events of\r\nJapanese history which have to do with the introduction of the\r\ncivilization from the continent. For three thousand years before the\r\nChristian era China has been looked upon as one of the cultured nations of\r\nthe earth. No written language has ever been or is now understood by so\r\nmany people as the Chinese. The Chinese were a civilized people centuries\r\nbefore the Japanese had, even according to their own uncertain legends,\r\nemerged into the light as an empire. If we accept the opinion which seems\r\nmost reasonable, that the Japanese came over to the Japanese islands from\r\nthe continent by way of Korea, and belong to the Mongol tribes of central\r\nAsia, then we must assume that the Japanese were closely related to a\r\nlarge section of the Chinese. They have been from the beginning of their\r\nhistory a receptive people. They have stood ready to welcome the good\r\nthings which were offered to them, coming from whatever direction. They\r\naccepted eagerly the Chinese written language and the philosophy with\r\nwhich it came charged. They accepted Buddhism with its priesthood and\r\ndogma and ritual, and permitted it to crowd their native religion until it\r\nbecame a pitiful minority. They have in recent times accepted with a\r\nhearty impetuosity the civilization of western nations, and are absorbing\r\nit as rapidly as the habits and thoughts of a people can take in so\r\nimportant a change.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the first introduction(79) of Chinese\r\nliterature into Japan. It took place in the reign of the Emperor Ōjin A.D.\r\n284. The ambassador who brought the tribute from Korea that year was Ajiki\r\nwho was familiar with the Chinese literature. He gave lessons in Chinese\r\nto the crown prince. The next year the king of Korea sent out an eminent\r\nscholar named Wani,(80) who continued to give instruction to the crown\r\nprince. From this time a knowledge of Chinese gradually spread and\r\nscholars were attached to the government to make a written record of the\r\nevents which took place. Historiographers were sent out during the reign\r\nof the Emperor Hanzei, A.D. 404, who were directed to make a record of all\r\nimportant events and forward them to the court. These steps soon began to\r\nshow themselves in the absence of the wonderful and legendary from the\r\nnarrative of events. Beginning with the reign of the Emperor Richū the\r\nages of the emperors which before his time had been of such a marvellous\r\nlength now drop to a reasonable and moderate period.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth emperor was Inkyō, the fourth son of the Emperor Nintoku.\r\nHe was of an amiable and philanthropic temperament, and accepted the\r\nposition of emperor with great reluctance. His health was delicate, and he\r\nfeared to take upon himself such a responsibility. In the meantime there\r\nwas an interregnum, and the court officials were anxious to have him enter\r\nupon the duties of emperor. At last he consented and became emperor A.D.\r\n412. It was during his reign that confusion arose concerning the family\r\nnames, or rather, that the confusion which had been long growing now had\r\nits settlement. Family names had been a matter of growth, and many persons\r\nclaimed the right to use a certain name who were in no wise entitled to\r\nit. The emperor took a singular and effectual method to settle the\r\ntroublesome and personal questions that arose. He summoned all those who\r\nclaimed to belong to any family whose claim was disputed to appear at\r\nAmakashi and show that they were entitled to the names they claimed. He\r\nplaced jars of boiling water and required each one to plunge his hand in\r\nthe water. He who was injured by the hot water was pronounced a deceiver,\r\nand he who came off unhurt was pronounced as entitled to the name. The\r\nemperor took occasion to settle the questions concerning names, and put\r\nthe matter on a more stable basis. And as the art of writing now began to\r\nbe more common among the people mistakes in regard to names did not again\r\nseriously recur.\r\n\r\nThe emperor’s ill-health was the occasion for the introduction of another\r\nof the civilizing arts of the continent. When the annual tribute from\r\nKorea was sent it so chanced that the ambassador who came with it was a\r\nperson versed in the medical art. If we estimate this man’s science or\r\nskill by that of the Chinese practitioner of a later day, we should\r\ncertainly not place a very high value on it. It is narrated, however, that\r\nhe cured the imperial invalid, and by this means gained great credit for\r\nhis profession, and added another to the obligations which Japan owed to\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Emperor Inkyō there was a quarrel about the\r\nsuccession between his two sons, Prince Kinashi-no-Karu and Prince\r\nAnaho-no-Ōji. The courtiers all favored the latter, who was the younger\r\nbrother, and he surrounded his elder brother in the house of\r\nMonobe-no-Ōmai. Seeing no way of escape he committed suicide.(81) The\r\nyounger brother then became the twentieth emperor, who is known under the\r\ncanonical name of Ankō. He had another difficulty growing out of social\r\ncomplications. He wanted to make the younger sister of Okusaka-no-Ōji, who\r\nwas the brother of the preceding Emperor Inkyō, the wife of\r\nŌhatsuse-no-Ōji, his own younger brother, who afterwards became the\r\nEmperor Yuriyaku. He sent as a messenger the court official, Ne-no-Ōmi, to\r\nask the consent of her elder brother, who gladly gave it, and as a token\r\nof his gratitude for this high honor he sent a rich necklace. Ne-no-Ōmi,\r\novercome with covetousness, kept the necklace for himself, and reported to\r\nthe emperor that Okusaka-no-Ōji refused his consent. The emperor was very\r\nangry, and sent a detachment of troops against the supposed offender. They\r\nsurrounded the house and put him to death. His chief attendants, knowing\r\nhis innocence, committed suicide by the side of their dead master. The\r\nemperor then completed his design of taking the sister of Okusaka-no-Ōji\r\nas the wife of the Prince Ōhatsuse-no-Ōji, and he also took his widow and\r\npromoted her to be his empress.\r\n\r\nOut of these circumstances arose serious troubles. His new empress had a\r\nyoung son by her first husband named Mayuwa-no-Ō, said to have been only\r\nseven years old. With his mother he was an inmate of the palace, and was\r\nprobably a spoiled and wayward boy. The emperor was afraid lest this boy,\r\nwhen he came to understand who had been the cause of the death of his\r\nfather, would undertake to revenge himself. He talked with the empress\r\nabout his fears and explained his apprehensions. The boy accidentally\r\nheard the conversation, and was probably stimulated thereby to do the very\r\nthing which the emperor feared. Creeping stealthily into the room where\r\nthe emperor lay asleep he stabbed him and then fled, taking refuge in the\r\nhouse of the Grandee Tsubura. The emperor was fifty-six years of age at\r\nthe time of his death. This tragical event produced a great excitement.\r\nThe younger brother of the emperor, Ōhatsuse, amazed and angry because his\r\ntwo older brothers were not, as he thought, sufficiently enraged by the\r\nmurder of the emperor, killed them both. Then he attacked the Grandee\r\nTsubura and the boy Mayuwa in their refuge. Seeing no way of escape\r\nTsubura, at the request of the boy, first slew him and then killed\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Ōhatsuse, who seemed to have been of a violent disposition,\r\nmurdered Ichinobe-no-Oshiha, son of the seventeenth emperor, Richū. His\r\ntwo sons, then merely boys, Ōke and Woke (literally big basket and little\r\nbasket), hearing of this catastrophe escaped into the province of Harima\r\nwhere they worked as cow-herds. Ōhatsuse was crowned as the twenty-first\r\nemperor and is known by the canonical name of Yūriyaku Tennō.\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 470 an ambassador came from Go in China and by order of\r\nthe emperor was entertained by the Grandee Ne-no-Ōmi. A court official,\r\nToneri, was directed to see that this duty was suitably performed. Now\r\nNe-no-Ōmi, it will be remembered, was the grandee who, on a former\r\noccasion, was sent by the Emperor Ankō to solicit the hand of the Princess\r\nHatahi-no-Ōji for the present emperor, who was then the crown prince. In\r\norder to entertain the Chinese ambassador with becoming magnificence,\r\nNe-no-Ōmi robed himself in a gorgeous manner and among other things put on\r\nthe rich necklace which he had stolen. Toneri reported to the emperor the\r\nsuperb entertainment which Ne-no-Ōmi had accorded to the Chinese\r\nambassador, and especially the necklace which he wore. The emperor\r\ninnocently asked that Ne-no-Ōmi should appear before him in order that he\r\nmight see his superb dress. The empress, who was with her husband when\r\nNe-no-Ōmi came in, recognized the necklace which had been sent by her\r\nbrother to the late emperor. The theft was charged and Ne-no-Ōmi compelled\r\nto confess. The emperor proclaimed the innocence of Okusaka-no-Ōji and his\r\ngreat regret at the mistaken punishments.\r\n\r\nThere are many traditions current in Japanese early history concerning\r\nthis emperor. In one he is represented in his imperial journeys to have\r\nseen a house belonging to Lord Shiki built with a raised roof like that of\r\nthe imperial palace. He was greatly enraged that any subject should dare\r\nto take such a liberty, and sent his attendants to burn the house down.\r\nThe poor frightened lord hastened to the emperor and humbly apologized for\r\nhis stupidity. And he presented to the emperor in token of his humble\r\nsubmission a white dog clothed with cloth and led by a string. So he was\r\nforgiven and his house was spared.\r\n\r\nIn another legend he is said to have come upon a beautiful girl by the\r\nriver side washing clothes. He stopped and conferred with her, and said to\r\nher, “Do not thou marry a husband, I will send for thee.” With this he\r\nreturned to the palace and forgot about his promise. But the poor girl did\r\nnot forget. Year after year passed, till at last after eighty years of\r\nwaiting she was a very old woman. Then she thought, “My face and form are\r\nlean and withered, there is no longer any hope. Nevertheless, if I do not\r\nshow the Heavenly Sovereign how truly I have waited, my disappointment\r\nwill be unbearable.” And so with such gifts as she could afford she\r\npresented herself before the emperor. He wondering at her and her gifts\r\nasked her, “What old woman art thou, and why art thou come hither?” She\r\nreplied, “Having in such and such a month and such and such a year\r\nreceived the Heavenly Sovereign’s commands, I have been reverently\r\nawaiting the great command until this day, and eighty years have passed\r\nby. Now, my appearance is decrepit and there is no longer any hope.\r\nNevertheless, I have come forth in order to show and declare my\r\nfaithfulness.” Thereupon the Heavenly Sovereign, greatly agitated,\r\nexclaimed, “I had quite forgotten my command; and thou meanwhile, ever\r\nfaithfully awaiting my commands, hast vainly let pass by the years of thy\r\nprime. It is too pitiful.” He sent her back to her home with such\r\nconsolation as rich gifts could impart.\r\n\r\nWe give one more of the legends which cling to the name of this emperor.\r\n\r\nHe was making an imperial progress to the moor of Akizu for the purpose of\r\nhunting. And as he sat down to rest a horse-fly bit his august arm. But\r\nimmediately a dragon-fly came and seized the horse-fly and flew away.\r\nThereupon he composed an august song as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who is it tells in the great presence that game is lying on the\r\n    peak of Womuro, at Mi-Yeshinu? Our Great Lord who tranquilly\r\n    carries on the government, being seated on the throne to await the\r\n    game, a horse-fly alights on and stings the fleshy part of his arm\r\n    fully clad in a sleeve of white stuff, and a dragon-fly quickly\r\n    eats up the horse-fly. That it might properly bear its name, the\r\n    land of Yamato was called the Island of the Dragon-Fly.(82)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a long reign Yūriyaku is said in _Kojiki_ to have died at the age of\r\none hundred and twenty-four.\r\n\r\nThe son of the Emperor Yūriyaku, Prince Shiraka, succeeded him. He is\r\nknown in history as the Emperor Seinei. He lived only five years after his\r\naccession and left no descendant to fill the throne. Search was\r\naccordingly made for some one of imperial blood who might become emperor.\r\nIt will be remembered that the Emperor Yūriyaku, before his accession, had\r\nmurdered Prince Ichinobe-no-Oshiwa, son of the eighteenth emperor, and\r\nthat his two sons, then young boys, Princes Ōke and Woke, made their\r\nescape into the province of Harima. A new governor of this province had\r\njust arrived and was in attendance at the festivities in honor of the\r\nopening of a new cave(83) by a citizen of the place. As usual there was\r\nfeasting, and drinking, and dancing. The two young men Ōke and Woke, who\r\noccupied menial positions in this household, were called upon to dance.\r\nAfter some hesitation they each in succession danced and sang some of the\r\nsongs which they had learned in their boyhood.(84) The new governor\r\nrecognized these songs to be such as were taught at the court, and on\r\nenquiring found the young men to be grandsons of the Emperor Richū. He\r\nbrought them to the palace and presented them to their aunt Queen Ii-Toyo.\r\nAfter a friendly contest between the two brothers, the younger one, Prince\r\nWoke, became the twenty-third emperor under the canonical name of Kenzō.\r\nHis reign was a very short one, only eight years according to the _Kojiki_\r\nand three years according to the _Nihongi_. The only incident of\r\nconsequence recorded of him is that he sought out the burial place of his\r\nfather, who had been murdered by the Emperor Yūriyaku, and transferred his\r\nremains to a fitting mausoleum. He also contemplated the desecration of\r\nthe mausoleum of the murderer as a mark of his vengeance, but was\r\ndissuaded by his brother from the undertaking.\r\n\r\nHe died without children and was succeeded by his elder brother Prince Ōke\r\nwho became A.D. 488 the twenty-fourth emperor under the canonical name of\r\nNinken.\r\n\r\nConcerning the emperor and several of his successors there is little of\r\ninterest to record. The twenty-fifth emperor, Muretsu (A.D. 499), who was\r\na son of the emperor Ninken, was chiefly notable for his cruelty. Some of\r\nthe acts recorded of him can only be equalled by those of the degenerate\r\noccupants of the imperial throne of Rome in its worst days. He reigned\r\neleven years and died without children. The twenty-sixth emperor was\r\nKeitai Tennō, who was the fifth descendant from Ōjin Tennō. The only\r\nnoticeable events in his reign were an expedition to Korea to settle\r\ndifficulties which had then intervened, and an expedition to Chikushi, the\r\nnorthern part of Kyūshū, to repress tumults which had arisen. The next\r\nemperors were Ankan Tennō and Senkuwa Tennō, whose reigns were uneventful.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-ninth emperor was Kimmei Tennō, (A.D. 540-571), who was the son\r\nof Keitai Tennō. He reigned thirty-two years and died at the age of\r\nsixty-three. It was during his reign, in A.D. 552, that an ambassador from\r\nKudara, one of the three provinces of Korea, presented to the emperor an\r\nimage of Shaka, and also Buddhist books explaining the doctrine. He\r\ncommended highly the new religion, and the emperor was deeply impressed\r\nwith its novelties. This seems the more probable because up to this time\r\nJapan looked upon China and Korea as leaders in civilization, and\r\ntherefore was disposed to regard what had obtained a footing there as\r\nworthy of acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe prime-minister Soga-no-Iname favored the new religion, and urged that\r\nthe image of Shaka which had been brought over should be duly set up and\r\nworshipped. But the ministers Monobe-no-Okoshi and Kumako opposed the\r\nproposition, saying, “Our country has its own gods; and they perhaps will\r\nbe angry with us if we pay our devotions to a foreign god.”\r\n\r\nBut the emperor settled the matter by saying, “Let Iname try it.” He gave\r\nthe idol to Iname with the directions that he should set it up and pray to\r\nit. Accordingly Iname took the image of Shaka and established it in a\r\nhouse of his own, which he created a temple, and worshipped it.\r\n\r\nBut shortly after this an epidemic broke out in the country, and Okoshi\r\nand Kumako declared that it was due to the strange god which had been\r\nreceived from the western barbarians, and besought the emperor to have it\r\nthrown away. The image therefore by the emperor’s command was thrown into\r\nthe sea near Naniwa,(85) and the temple in which it had been erected was\r\ndestroyed. This was the first movement towards the introduction of\r\nBuddhism.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the thirtieth emperor, Bitatsu Tennō, A.D. 572, who was\r\nthe son of Kimmei Tennō, Kudara again made a contribution of Buddhist\r\nemblems, viz.: books of Buddhist doctrine; a priest of Ritsu sect; a\r\npriest; a nun; a diviner; an image maker; and a Buddhist temple carpenter.\r\nThese were all housed in the temple of Owake-no-O at Naniwa. Seven years\r\nafter this two Japanese ambassadors who had been sent to Kudara brought\r\nback with them several Buddhist images of stone, which the Daijin Umako\r\nobtained as his possession. He built several Buddhist temples in which he\r\nplaced the images and other precious relics which he had secured. He also\r\nbuilt a pagoda and houses in which the priests and nuns resided. When\r\nUmako was sick he asked from the emperor that he might avail himself of\r\nthe Buddhist ritual. The emperor gave him this privilege, but commanded\r\nhim to restrict it to himself.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Bitatsu died A.D. 585 at the age of forty-eight. His successor\r\nwas Emperor Yōmei the thirty-first in order from the Emperor Jimmu. He was\r\nby his mother a descendant of the Soga family and his first wife was also\r\na daughter of the prime-minister, the Noble Iname who was also of the Soga\r\nfamily. The bitter hostility between the members of the court who favored\r\nBuddhism and those who opposed it continued. The leader of the former\r\nparty was Umako now the prime-minister, while the opponents of Buddhism\r\nwere led by Moriya. One of the occasions when their hostility broke out\r\nwas when the emperor was taken sick and he wished to try the effect of the\r\nBuddhist Sampō, that is, the three precious elements of Buddhism, Buddha,\r\nthe rites of Buddhism, and the Buddhist priests. Moriya and his party\r\nadvised against this conformity to Buddhism, but Umako supported him in\r\nhis wishes and introduced a Buddhist priest into the palace to attend upon\r\nthe emperor. In spite of all this effort, however, the emperor died,\r\nhaving reigned only three years.\r\n\r\nThe death of the emperor was the signal for the breaking out of serious\r\ndisturbances. Moriya the champion of the old religion was killed and his\r\nparty overpowered. From this time Buddhism may be said to have triumphed\r\nin Japan. The thirty-second emperor, Sujun, was crowned A.D. 588. He was\r\nthe son of the Emperor Kimmei, and at the time of his accession was\r\nsixty-nine years of age. The communication with Korea continued, and more\r\nand more of the Buddhist culture was introduced. Umako, who now had\r\nundisputed sway in the government, sent out to Korea persons to study the\r\nBuddhist faith, and consecrated many priests and nuns and erected temples\r\nfor the new worship.\r\n\r\nBut everything did not move smoothly. Umako, with all his zeal and\r\nenthusiasm for Buddhism, was suspected of personal ambition, and was\r\nlooked upon with distrust. A plot to assassinate the emperor was planned\r\nby Umako, which terminated his life, after a reign of only four years, in\r\nthe seventy-third year of his age.\r\n\r\nThe thirty-third sovereign was the Empress Suiko, who was the sister of\r\nthe Emperor Yōmei. Her coronation took place A.D. 593. Her reign was\r\nchiefly remarkable for the active influence of Umaydo-no-Ōji (A.D.\r\n572-622), who was the second son of the Emperor Yōmei, and who was made\r\ncrown prince under the empress, and aided her in the administration of the\r\npolitical affairs of the government. This prince is better known by his\r\nposthumous title of Shōtoku Taishi (great teacher of the divine virtue),\r\nand is held in great reverence as the principal founder and promoter of\r\nBuddhism in Japan. His name has been linked with many legends, which are\r\nstill current after the lapse of fourteen hundred years. It is said that\r\nas soon as he was born he was able to speak, and was in all respects a\r\nvery clever boy. His memory was wonderfully acute. He had Napoleon the\r\nGreat’s talent of attending to several things at the same time. He could\r\nhear the appeals of eight persons at once, and give to each a proper\r\nanswer. From this circumstance he sometimes went by the name of\r\nYatsumimi-no-Ōji, that is, Prince of Eight Ears.\r\n\r\nThe prince threw the whole influence of the government in favor of\r\nBuddhism. Many temples were built in different central districts for the\r\nconvenience of the new religion. Under his influence the officers of the\r\ngovernment rivalled each other in founding temples and maintaining them at\r\ntheir own expense. He took as his teacher a priest who had recently come\r\nfrom Korea, and from him for the first time learned the five Buddhist\r\ncommandments:\r\n\r\n      1. Against stealing.\r\n      2. Against lying.\r\n      3. Against intemperance.\r\n      4. Against murder.\r\n      5. Against adultery.\r\n\r\nHe gave command to an artificer in copper to make large images of Buddha\r\nfor each of the officers in the government. The king of Koma in Korea\r\nhearing of this great undertaking sent a contribution of three hundred\r\n_ryō_ of gold. The images were finished in due time and an imposing\r\nreligious ceremonial was held in honor of the event. Many of the principal\r\ntemples of Buddhism in different parts of Japan take their origin from the\r\ntime of Shōtoku Taishi, and no single character in history is so\r\nintimately connected with the development of Buddhism.\r\n\r\nIt was not only as a religious reformer, however, that he deserves to be\r\nremembered. He was a a most painstaking and enlightened ruler. He\r\nstudiously gathered from the Chinese the elements and methods of\r\ngovernment and adapted them to his own country.(86) From his time the\r\nstudy of Chinese literature became the essential culture of the active\r\nminds of Japan.\r\n\r\nShōtoku Taishi died A.D. 622, having been the principal officer of the\r\ngovernment for twenty-nine years.\r\n\r\nThe impulse which Shōtoku had given to Buddhism did not subside. In the\r\nyear following his death officers were appointed to govern the growing\r\nreligious communities, called Sosho and Sozu, which in dignity and power\r\ncorresponded to archbishops and bishops in Christian nomenclature. The\r\nfirst archbishop was Kwankin, a priest from Kudara, and the first bishop\r\nwas Tokuseki of Kurabe. These officials examined every priest and nun and\r\nmade a register of them. A census of Buddhism is also given which belongs\r\nto this same period. According to this there were forty-six Buddhist\r\ntemples and 1385 priests and nuns.\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 626, Soga-no-Umako the _daijin_ and a life-long friend\r\nand promoter of Buddhism died, and two years later the Empress Suiko died.\r\nSo nearly all the prominent participants in the events which had taken\r\nplace since the first entrance of Buddhism into Japan, had disappeared. In\r\nthe meantime a religion had taken possession of a field in which it was\r\ndestined to exert a wide influence and undergo a national development.\r\n\r\nAlong with this religion had come a literature and a culture, which when\r\nabsorbed into the life of this people gave them the permanent\r\ncharacteristics which we now recognize as the Japanese civilization. The\r\nfreer and more frequent intercourse with China and Korea brought with it\r\nnot only a knowledge of books and writing, but many improvements in arts\r\nand many new arts and agricultural industries. When the forces of the\r\nEmpress Jingō returned from Korea they brought with them persons skilled\r\nin many industrial occupations. It is a tradition that a descendant of the\r\nKan dynasty in China had fled to Korea on the fall of that dynasty, and in\r\nthe twentieth year of the Emperor Ōjin (A.D. 290) had migrated to Japan\r\nwith a colony who were familiar with weaving and sewing. In the\r\nthirty-seventh year of the same emperor an officer was sent to China to\r\nobtain more weavers and sewers. The cultivation of the mulberry tree and\r\nthe breeding of silk-worms(87) was introduced from China in A.D. 457, and\r\nin order to encourage this industry the empress herself engaged in it. At\r\nthis early period this important industry was begun, or at least received\r\nan impulse which has been continued down to the present time.\r\n\r\nWith these industrial arts came in rapid succession the elements of a\r\nhigher civilization. Books on almanac-making, astronomy, geography and\r\ndivination were brought to Japan from Korea and China. The Chinese\r\ncalendar(88) was first used in the reign of the Empress Suiko under the\r\nregency of Shōtoku Taishi. This almanac was based on the lunar periods and\r\nthe civil year began with the new moon occurring about the beginning of\r\nFebruary. But as the length of the civil year is not an exact multiple of\r\nthe number of days contained in a lunation, the twelve lunar months used\r\nby the Chinese and Japanese will be about eleven days shorter than the\r\nsolar year. Hence to prevent the discrepancy from increasing and throwing\r\nthe seasons entirely out of their place in the calendar, an intercalary\r\nmonth was inserted nearly every third year. It was inserted not at the end\r\nof the year but whenever the discrepancy had reached the number of days in\r\na lunation. The month thus inserted was called by the same name as the\r\npreceding with an explanatory prefix. From this period therefore the dates\r\nof Japanese events may be relied upon with some degree of certainty. For\r\nevents occurring before this period, a knowledge of which must have been\r\ntransmitted by oral tradition, the dates assigned to them in the _Nihongi_\r\nmust have been computed by counting back to the supposed time according to\r\nthe calendar in use at the time of the writing.\r\n\r\nThe astronomy and geography introduced into Japan along with\r\nalmanac-making in the fifth century were without question very primitive\r\nsciences. At this time even in Europe the knowledge of these sciences was\r\nnot advanced beyond the imperfect notions of the Greeks. It was not until\r\nthe sixteenth century, when the discoveries of the Portuguese and the\r\nSpaniards and the English had revealed the shape and the divisions of the\r\nearth, and the Jesuits had carried this knowledge to China and Japan, that\r\nanything like a correct astronomy or geography was possible. By\r\ndivination, which is mentioned as one of the sciences brought over from\r\nKorea, was meant the determination of future events or of lucky or unlucky\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe most important civilizing force introduced from China at this period\r\nwas the formal institutions of education. Although the first establishment\r\nof a school dates from the reign of the Emperor Tenji (A.D. 668-671), yet\r\nit was not till the reign of the Emperor Mommu (A.D. 697-707) that the\r\nuniversity was regularly organized. Branch schools were also established\r\nin the several provinces. In the university there were departments for\r\nChinese literature, for medicine, for astronomy and almanac-making, and\r\nfor astrology. Under the first head were included the art of writing the\r\nChinese characters, the practice of composition, the study of the Chinese\r\nclassics, and the reading of books of Chinese history. In like manner the\r\ntraining of the students in medicine chiefly consisted in making them\r\nfamiliar with the methods which prevailed in China. The properties of\r\nmedicinal plants, the variations of the pulse in health and disease and in\r\nthe changing seasons, and the anatomy of the human body were the chief\r\nsubjects of study. The human cadaver was never dissected, but a knowledge\r\nof anatomy was obtained from diagrams which were wholly hypothetical. In\r\nearly times medical officers were appointed to experiment with medicines\r\nupon monkeys, and also to dissect the bodies of monkeys. From these\r\ndissections, as well as from the printed diagrams of Chinese books the\r\nimperfect knowledge which they had reached was derived. It was not till\r\n1771 that Sugita Genpaku(89) and several other Japanese scholars had an\r\nopportunity to dissect the body of a criminal, and by personal observation\r\nfound the utter falsity of the Chinese diagrams on which they had hitherto\r\nrelied, and the correctness of the Dutch books, which they had, contrary\r\nto the laws of the country, learned to read.\r\n\r\nThe great reverence felt for Chinese culture led to the introduction at an\r\nearly date of the Chinese system of official rank. The system remained in\r\nforce down to the restoration in 1868. The officers were _Daijō-daijin_\r\n(Prime-Minister), _Sa-daijin_ (Minister of the Left), _U-daijin_ (Minister\r\nof the Right), together with eight boards,(90) charged with the various\r\nduties of administration. These boards were divided into sections, and the\r\nvarious departments of the government were respectively performed by them.\r\nIn this way the administration became thoroughly bureaucratic, in\r\nimitation of the Chinese empire, to which the Japanese at this time looked\r\nup with the most complete reverence.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these official boards, six official ranks were also\r\nintroduced from China. These ranks were designated, first, virtue; second,\r\nhumanity; third, propriety; fourth, truth; fifth, righteousness, and\r\nsixth, wisdom. Each of these ranks(91) was divided into two orders termed\r\nrespectively the Greater and the Lesser. Thus there were twelve\r\ndistinctions in this system. It was introduced in the reign of the Empress\r\nSuiko, A.D. 604, and is generally attributed to the Regent Shōtoku, who\r\nwas a great admirer of the continental civilization. It existed in this\r\nform until the time of the Emperor Kōtoku, when, A.D. 649, it was extended\r\nto nineteen distinctions. These were not given to the individual in\r\nrecognition of talent, but to families to be by them transmitted to their\r\nposterity as hereditary rank.\r\n\r\nFor many years during this period of active intercourse with China and\r\nKorea, Dazaifu, situated on the west coast of Kyūshū, north of the present\r\nsituation of Nagasaki, was the recognized port where strangers were\r\nreceived. This city was the seat of a vice-royalty, having control over\r\nthe nine provinces of Kyūshū. The office of vice-governor was considered a\r\nplace of honorable banishment to which distinguished men who were\r\ndistasteful at court could be sent.\r\n\r\nThese continental influences continued for many years and indeed have\r\nnever ceased. There has always existed a class of scholars who looked upon\r\nChinese learning as the supreme pinnacle to which the human mind could\r\nattain. This was especially true of the admirers of Confucius and\r\nConfucianism. Although it was not until a much later period that the\r\nculture of a Chinese philosophy attained its highest mark, yet even in the\r\nearly arrangement of the studies in the university we see the wide\r\ninfluence which the writings of the Chinese classics exerted.\r\n\r\nWe close this chapter with an event which evinced the advance which\r\nJapanese civilization had made, and aided greatly in promoting this\r\nadvance in the subsequent centuries. This event was the publication of the\r\n_Kojiki_ (Record of Ancient Things) and the _Nihongi_ (Chronicles of\r\nJapan). A book still older than these is said to have been composed in\r\nA.D. 620, but it perished in a fire in A.D. 645, although a fragment is\r\nsaid to have been rescued. The circumstances attending the preparation of\r\nthe _Kojiki_ are given by Mr. Satow in his paper(92) on the “Revival of\r\nPure Shintō,” and also by Mr. Chamberlain(93) in his introduction to the\r\ntranslation. The Emperor Temmu had resolved to take measures to preserve\r\nthe true traditions from oblivion. He had the records carefully examined\r\nand compiled. Then these collated traditions were one by one committed to\r\none of the household officers, Hiyeda-no-Are, who had a marvellously\r\nretentive memory. Before the work of compilation was finished the emperor\r\ndied; but the Empress Gemmyō, who after an interval succeeded him, carried\r\nit on to its completion in A.D. 712. By her direction the traditions were\r\ntaken down from Are’s dictation in the form in which we now have them. It\r\nis by no means a pleasing or attractive work, even in the opinion of the\r\nJapanese. It is bald and archaic in its form and composition. It is,\r\nhowever, notable as being freer from the admixture of Chinese learning,\r\nand therefore a better index of the native culture of the race than the\r\nworks which followed it.(94) Much of it consists of mere genealogies of\r\nthe emperors and naked statements of leading events, but there are besides\r\nthis many legends and poems which bear evidence of having been handed down\r\nin essentially their present form. As an authority for the chronology of\r\nthe early events it is, of course, of small value. It is evident that\r\nwhere a narrative of events has been carried through many centuries by\r\ntradition alone, without written records to check or assist it, no\r\ndependence can be placed on the chronology of the events, further than,\r\nperhaps, on the order of sequence.\r\n\r\nOnly eight years after the publication of the _Kojiki_, a second work\r\ntermed _Nihongi_ or Chronicles of Japan was issued. It was prepared by\r\nimperial command and appeared in A.D. 720 in the reign of the Empress\r\nGenshō. It differs from the older book in being composed in the Chinese\r\nidiom, and in being much more tinctured with the ideas of Chinese\r\nphilosophy. These two works, so nearly contemporaneous, both of them\r\ncomposed in so great a degree of the legendary elements of Japanese\r\nhistory, must be looked upon as marking a distinct epoch in the story of\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE MIDDLE AGES OF JAPAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of the Japanese government during the greater part of its long\r\ncareer has been that of an absolute monarchy. The emperor was supposed to\r\nhold in his hands the supreme authority, and to dispose, as he saw fit, of\r\nhonors and emoluments, offices and administrative duties. There was no\r\nfundamental law of succession, by which the order of accession to the\r\nthrone was regulated. The reigning emperor usually selected during his\r\nlifetime some one of his sons, or, if he had no sons, some other prince of\r\nthe imperial family, who became the crown prince during the life of the\r\nemperor, and on his death succeeded to the throne.(95) The selection was\r\nusually made with the concurrence of the officers of the court, and very\r\noften must be credited entirely to the preference of these officers.\r\nSometimes the emperor died before the appointment of a crown prince had\r\ntaken place. In this case the selection lay in the hands of the court\r\nofficers, and many cases are recorded in the history of the empire where\r\nserious disturbances arose between the partisans of different aspirants to\r\nthe throne. These disturbances usually account for the _interregna_ which\r\nare so often found between the reigns of successive sovereigns.\r\n\r\nTo the freedom which has prevailed, not only in the imperial house but\r\nalso in all the families of the empire, in regard to the rights of\r\nsuccession, must be attributed the long and unbroken line which the\r\nimperial house of Japan is able to show. That a line of sovereigns should\r\ncontinue from the time of Jimmu down to the present without break by\r\nreason of the failure of children, is of course impossible. But the\r\ndifficulty disappears when it is remembered, that in case of the failure\r\nof a son to succeed, the father provided for the want by adopting as his\r\nson some prince of the imperial family, and appointing him as his heir.\r\nWith this principle of adoption must be mentioned the practice of\r\nabdication(96) which produced a marked and constantly recurring influence\r\nin the history of Japan. Especially was this the case in the middle ages\r\nof Japanese history. The practice spread from the imperial house downwards\r\ninto all departments of Japanese life. Although the principle of\r\nabdication and adoption was probably brought from China and was adopted by\r\nthe Japanese as a mark of superior culture, yet these practices were\r\ncarried to a much greater extent in Japan than was ever thought of in\r\ntheir original home. We shall see in the story of Japanese times the\r\namazing and ludicrous extent to which the abdication of reigning\r\nsovereigns was carried. We shall witness even the great and sagacious\r\nIeyasu himself, after holding the office of shōgun for only two years,\r\nretiring in favor of his son Hidetada, and yet from his retirement\r\npractically exercising the authority of the office for many years.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 668 the Emperor Tenji(97) began a brief reign of three years. As\r\nhe had been regent during the two preceding reigns, and chiefly managed\r\nthe administration, very little change occurred after his accession to\r\npower. His reign is mainly remarkable for the first appearance in a\r\nprominent position of the Fujiwara family. The emperor appointed his\r\ncounsellor Nakatomi-no-Kamatari as _nai-daijin_ (private minister), an\r\noffice next in rank after _sa-daijin_, and which was created at this time.\r\nNakatomi, was authorized to assume the family name of Fujiwara, meaning\r\nwistaria-field. The ancestor of this family, Nakatomi-no-Muraji,(98) was\r\nfabled to have come down from the celestial plains to the island of\r\nKyūshū. The family therefore ranks with that of the emperor as the oldest\r\nand most honored in the empire. From the time of its establishment down to\r\nthe present it has enjoyed many honors and privileges, and has played a\r\nvery distinguished part in the history of the country. This family first\r\nbecame prominent during the reign of the Emperor Kōtoku. The Soga family\r\nfrom the times of the first introduction of Buddhism had grown to be the\r\nmost powerful and influential in the empire. Umako had held the position\r\nof _daijin_ and his son Yemishi became _daijin_ after his father’s death.\r\nYemishi presumed upon his promotion to this high office and put on the\r\nairs of hereditary rank. He built castles for himself and son and\r\norganized guards for their defence. His son Iruka became _daijin_ after\r\nhis father’s death and conducted himself with even greater arrogance. At\r\nlast his conduct became intolerable and he was assassinated A.D. 645. The\r\nchief actor in this plot was Nakatomi-no-Kamatari, who was at this time on\r\nintimate terms with the prince who afterwards became the Emperor Tenji.\r\n\r\nFurther experiences, this time disastrous, with Korea were encountered\r\nduring this reign. A Japanese garrison had been maintained in Kudara, the\r\nwestern division of Korea. But at this time the people of Shiraki with\r\nhelp from China attacked this garrison and compelled it to retreat to\r\nJapan. Along with the Japanese came many of the Koreans who had been\r\nfriendly with them, and who carried with them, like the Huguenots when\r\ndriven from France, a knowledge of many arts and a culture which were\r\neagerly welcomed by the rising Japanese empire. They were colonized in\r\nconvenient quarters in different provinces, and as an encouragement freed\r\nfrom taxation for a time. Their influence upon the opening civilization of\r\nJapan cannot be overlooked or neglected in our estimate of the forces\r\nwhich conspired to produce the final result. In the book of Japanese\r\nannals called _Nihon Shoki_ there is a statement(99) that in the fifth\r\nmonth of the second year of _Reiki_ (A.D. 717) 1799 Koreans were collected\r\ntogether in the province of Musashi and formed the district of “Koma-gōri”\r\nor Korean district. Again in the third year of _Tempyō Hoji_ (A.D. 760)\r\nforty inhabitants of Shinra (a kingdom of Korea) and thirty-four priests\r\nand priestesses came to Japan and founded the “Shinra-gōri,” or Korean\r\ndistrict. These events occurred not long after the time we are now\r\nconsidering and show that the Korean colonization still continued and that\r\nthe influence of the arts and culture which the colonists introduced was\r\nmarked and important.\r\n\r\nFew events are noted during the reigns which succeeded. The following are\r\nthe most worthy of mention. The Emperor Temmu (A.D. 673-686) added several\r\nnew degrees of rank to those already established. He also favored the\r\nBuddhist religion by making its services obligatory, and by forbidding the\r\neating of flesh. Silver was first discovered in Tsushima A.D. 674, which\r\nwas followed twenty years later by the manufacture of the first silver\r\nmoney. Copper was discovered in Musashi in the reign of the Empress Gemmyō\r\n(A.D. 708-715) and the making of copper money came into vogue. Before that\r\ntime the copper money in use was obtained from Korea and China. Gold coin\r\nis said to have been first issued under the Emperor Junnin (A.D. 759-765).\r\nAn observatory was established for the inspection of the stars in\r\nconnection with the new department of astrology. The cultivation of the\r\nlacquer tree and the mulberry and the raising of silk-worms were still\r\nfurther encouraged and extended. Cremation was first practised about A.D.\r\n700 in the case of a Buddhist priest who left directions that his body\r\nshould be burned. Since that time cremation has been employed for the\r\ndisposal of the dead by the Shin (or Monto) sect, and is now authorized\r\nbut not made obligatory by the government. The progress made by Buddhism\r\nis shown by the census of temples which was made in the reign of the\r\nEmpress Jito (A.D. 690-702) and which gave the number as 545. The\r\npublication of the _Kojiki_ in A.D. 712, and of the _Nihongi_ eight years\r\nlater, has already been referred to at the close of the preceding chapter.\r\nThese works are still looked upon as the foundations of Japanese\r\nliterature and the highest authorities of Japanese history.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the Empress Gemmyō (A.D. 710) the imperial residence was\r\nfixed at Nara. Up to this time the custom(100) derived from antiquity had\r\nprevailed of changing the residence on the accession of each new emperor.\r\nBut the court continued at Nara for a period of seventy-five years running\r\nthrough seven reigns; and in consequence Nara has always been looked upon\r\nwith peculiar reverence, and is the seat of several of the most notable\r\nBuddhist and Shintō temples(101) and structures. It is here that\r\nKasuga-no-miya was founded in A.D. 767 and dedicated to the honor of the\r\nancestor of the Fujiwara family. Here also is Tō-dai-ji a Buddhist temple\r\nfamed for containing the bronze statue of Great Buddha. This colossal idol\r\nwas constructed in A.D. 736 under the Emperor Shōmu, during the time that\r\nthe imperial court resided at Nara. The height of the image is fifty-three\r\nfeet, being seven feet higher than the Daibutsu at Kamakura. The temple\r\nwas built over the image and in A.D. 1180 was destroyed by a fire which\r\nmelted the head of the image. This was replaced. The temple was burned\r\nagain A.D. 1567, from which time the image has remained as the Japanese\r\nsay “a wet god.”\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 794(102) during the reign of the Emperor Kwammu (A.D. 782-806) the\r\ncapital was removed to Kyōto on the banks of the Kamogawa. The situation\r\nand the environs are lovely, and justify the affectionate reverence with\r\nwhich it has ever been regarded. Here were built the palaces and offices\r\nfor the emperor and his court. It was officially called Miyako, that is,\r\nresidence of the sovereign. It continued to be occupied as the capital\r\nuntil A.D. 1868, when the court was moved to Tōkyō. At this time the name\r\nof the city was changed to Saikyō, which means western capital, in\r\ndistinction from Tōkyō, which means eastern capital.\r\n\r\nThe Emishi in the northern part of the Main island continued to give much\r\ntrouble to the government. During the reign of the Emperor Shōmu (A.D.\r\n724-756) Fujiwara-no-Umakai was sent against these restless neighbors and\r\nsucceeded in reducing them to subjection, which lasted longer than usual.\r\nA fort was built to keep them in subjection, called the castle of Taga.\r\nThere is still standing a stone monument at Taga, between Sendai and\r\nMatsushima, on which is an inscription which has been translated by Mr.\r\nAston,(103) of the British legation. The inscription gives the date of its\r\nfirst construction, which corresponds to A.D. 724, and of its restoration,\r\nA.D. 762. Mr. Aston points out that the _ri_ here mentioned is not the\r\npresent Japanese _ri_ equivalent to miles 2.44, but the ancient _ri_ which\r\nis somewhat less than half a mile. This makes it evident that the part of\r\nthe Main island north of a point near Sendai was at this time denominated\r\nYezo, and was occupied by the barbarous tribes who then as now called\r\nthemselves Yezo.\r\n\r\nThe employment of a Fujiwara in this expedition was probably purely\r\nperfunctory. So far as we know, this family, which had by this time risen\r\nto a position of great influence, was in no respect military, and the\r\nappointment of Umakai as chief of the forces sent against the Ainos was\r\ndue to the political prominence of his family. For many centuries the\r\nrelations of the Fujiwara family to the imperial house was most intimate.\r\nIndeed the late Viscount Mori,(104) in his introduction to _Education in\r\nJapan_, speaks of this relation as a “proprietorship.” “The throne for a\r\ntime became virtually the property of one family, who exclusively\r\ncontrolled it.” This family was that of Fujiwara,(105) to which reference\r\nhas already been made. The founder of this house, Kamatari, was a man of\r\ngreat talent and administrative ability, and his immediate successors were\r\nworthy of their ancestor’s fame, and in succession filled the office of\r\n_daijin._ In this way the office came to be regarded as hereditary in the\r\nFujiwara family. The office of _kuambaku_, also from about A.D. 880,\r\nbecame hereditary in the Fujiwara house. Owing to the great age and\r\nprominence of the family, it became customary to marry the emperors and\r\nprinces of the imperial house to ladies taken from it, so that after a\r\ntime the mothers and wives of the princes of the imperial house were\r\nwithout exception descendants of the Fujiwara, and the offices of the\r\ncourt were in the hands of this family. In this condition of things the\r\nabdication of emperors, before they had reigned long enough to learn the\r\nduties of their position, became the common practice. This vicious custom\r\nwas encouraged by the Fujiwara, because it placed greater authority in\r\ntheir hands, and left them to conduct the administration without\r\ntroublesome interference. The Emperor Seiwa (A.D. 859-880) commenced to\r\nreign when he was nine years of age, and abdicated when he was\r\ntwenty-six.(106) Shujaku (A.D. 931-952) became emperor when he was eight\r\nyears of age and abdicated at the age of twenty-three. Toba became emperor\r\n(A.D. 1108) at five years of age, and resigned at the age of twenty.\r\nRokujō was made emperor (A.D. 1166) at the age of two and resigned at the\r\nage of four. Takakura, who succeeded Rokujō (A.D. 1169), was eight years\r\nof age and abdicated at the age of nineteen. It often happened that there\r\nwere living at the same time several retired emperors, besides the actual\r\nemperor.(107) Thus, in the period when Ichijō began his reign at the age\r\nof seven (A.D. 987), there were three retired emperors still living, viz.:\r\nReizei, who began to reign (A.D. 968) at eighteen, and retired at twenty;\r\nEnyū, who began to reign (A.D. 970) at eleven, and retired at twenty-six;\r\nKwazan, who began to reign (A.D. 985) at seventeen, and retired at\r\nnineteen. At a period somewhat later than the one now under consideration,\r\nduring the reign of Go-Nijō, who had just been made emperor (A.D. 1301) at\r\nseventeen, and who retired at nineteen, there were four retired emperors\r\nliving. When the emperors retired they often went into a Buddhist\r\nmonastery, taking the title of _hō-ō_ or _cloistered emperor_. From this\r\nsacred seclusion they continued many times to wield the powers of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe object of this abdication was twofold. The sovereigns themselves often\r\nbecame restless and dissatisfied in the constrained attitude which they\r\nwere compelled to maintain. If they were in the least ambitious to meet\r\nthe requirements of their elevated position and realized in any degree the\r\nlegitimate claims which their country had upon them, their natural efforts\r\nto take part in the administration were promptly checked, and they were\r\nreminded that it was unbecoming and unfitting for the descendants of the\r\ngods to mingle in ordinary earthly affairs. In this way it often fell out\r\nthat the ablest of the emperors retired from the actual position of\r\nreigning emperor in order to free themselves from the restraints of\r\netiquette and from the burden of _ennui_ which held them captive. They\r\nassumed the dignity of retired emperors, and often from their retirement\r\nwielded a greater influence and exerted a far more active part in the\r\nadministration of affairs than they ever had been able to do when upon the\r\nimperial throne.\r\n\r\nBesides this motive which affected the occupants of the throne, there was\r\na corresponding one which led the officers of the court to encourage and\r\nperhaps sometimes to compel the emperors to abdicate. These administrative\r\nofficers, into whose hands the management of the government had fallen,\r\nwere desirous to retain their authority, and therefore whenever an emperor\r\nexhibited signs of independence, or any disposition to think or act for\r\nhimself, they contrived means to have him retire and leave in his place\r\nsome inexperienced boy who could be more easily controlled.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of supervising statesmanship the Fujiwara family became, and\r\nfor centuries remained, supreme experts. For a period of four hundred\r\nyears, from A.D. 645 to 1050, they monopolized nearly all the important\r\noffices in the government. The wives and concubines of the feeble emperors\r\nwere all taken from its inexhaustible _repertoire_. The men of the family,\r\namong whom were always some of administrative ability, found it a task of\r\nno great difficulty to rule the emperor who was supposed to be divinely\r\ninspired to rule the empire, especially when he was usually a boy whose\r\nmother, wife, and court favorites were all supplied from the Fujiwara\r\nfamily. This kind of life and environment could not fail to produce on the\r\nsuccessive emperors a sadly demoralizing effect. They were brought up in\r\nan enervating atmosphere and their whole life was spent in arts and\r\nemployments which, instead of developing in them a spirit of independence\r\nand a high ambition and ability to govern well the empire committed to\r\nthem, led them to devote themselves to pleasures, and to leave to others\r\nless fortunate the duty of administering the affairs of government.\r\n\r\nThe same circumstances which demoralized the occupants of the imperial\r\nthrone served in a certain though less degree to enervate and enfeeble the\r\nFujiwara family. Although they sometimes appointed one of their number the\r\ncommander of an expedition against the Emishi, or to put down fresh\r\nrevolts in the island of Kyūshū, yet his duties were purely honorary. He\r\nusually remained at home and sent one or more of the active military\r\nchieftains to lead the forces against the enemy in the field. If the\r\nexpedition was successful, however, the honorary commander did not forget\r\nto have himself duly promoted, and rewarded with additional lands and\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nOther families besides the Fujiwara, rose in these long and weary\r\ncenturies to prominence, and seemed on the point of disputing the security\r\nof their position. Thus the Tachibana in the eighth century attained high\r\nhonors and distinction. It was an old family, and even as far back as the\r\nlegend of Yamato-dake(108) we find that a princess of the Tachibana family\r\nwas his wife, who sacrificed herself in the bay of Yedo to appease the\r\nturbulent waters. It was Maroyé, a member of the Tachibana family and a\r\nfavorite of the Emperor Shōmu (A.D. 724-756), who compiled the collection\r\nof ancient Japanese poetry called Man-yōshū or collection of Myriad\r\nLeaves.\r\n\r\nAnother family which attained prominence was the Sugawara. It originated\r\nin the province of Kawachi. The most noted representative of this family\r\nwas Sugawara Michizané, who was first conspicuous as the teacher of the\r\nyoung prince who afterward became the Emperor Uda (A.D. 888-898). He was a\r\nbrilliant scholar in Chinese, which was then the learned language of the\r\nEast. Even down to modern times his family has been devoted to learning.\r\nThe Sugawara(109) and Ōye families both had adopted literature as their\r\nhereditary profession, and the government made them an allowance for the\r\nexpenses(110) of those who might be pursuing their studies in the national\r\nuniversity. The influence of Michizané over the emperor was marked and\r\nsalutary. Under his wise tutelage Uda showed so much independence that the\r\nFujiwara _Kwambaku_ found means to lead him to abdicate in favor of his\r\nson, who became the sixtieth emperor, and is known under the historic name\r\nof Daigo. Michizané became the counsellor and was created _nai-daijin_\r\nunder the new emperor, who at the time of his accession was only fourteen\r\nyears old. But the _Kwambaku_ Tokihira determined to free himself from the\r\nadverse influence of this wise and honest counsellor. So he had him sent\r\nin a kind of honorable banishment to Dazaifu, the seat of the vice-royalty\r\nof the island of Kyūshū. It is said that he died here in A.D. 903. There\r\nwas a great re-action in regard to him after his death, and he was\r\ncanonized under the name of Tenjin(111) (Heavenly god), and is held sacred\r\nas the patron saint of men of letters and of students. The twenty-fifth\r\nday of each month is kept as a holiday in schools, sacred to Tenjin-Sama,\r\nand the twenty-fifth of June as an annual _matsuri_.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                Michizane.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the families which finally displaced the Fujiwara from their position\r\nof supremacy were what were technically called the military families. The\r\nseparation of officers into civil and military was made under the reforms\r\nintroduced from China. The Fujiwara in the main restricted themselves to\r\ncivil duties. Wherever it was necessary to send military expeditions\r\nagainst the barbarians of the north, or rebels in Kyūshū, or into the\r\ndisaffected districts of Korea, commanders were selected from families\r\ndevoted to military service. The Taira family was of this class. Hei is\r\nthe Chinese equivalent of the Japanese name Taira, and is more often used\r\nin the literature of the times. The Taira family sprang from the Emperor\r\nKwammu (A.D. 782-806) through one of his concubines. The great-grandson of\r\nKwammu, Takamochi, received permission to adopt the name of Taira, and\r\nthus became the founder of the family. They were the military vassals of\r\nthe crown for many generations.\r\n\r\nA little later than the Taira arose another family, the Minamoto, whose\r\nequivalent Chinese name was Gen. It sprang from the Emperor Seiwa (A.D.\r\n859-880). His son Tadazumi became minister of war. Tadazumi had two sons,\r\nwho were granted the family name of Minamoto; the descendants of one of\r\nthem, Tsunemoto, being created military vassals.\r\n\r\nThe almost constant wars in which the empire was engaged led to the\r\nextension of the military class. From the time now under discussion the\r\nmilitary class came to be looked upon as a distinct and separate part of\r\nthe population. It was composed of those who in the time of war showed an\r\naptitude for arms, and who were most serviceable in the campaigns which\r\nthey undertook. Gradually they became distinct from the agricultural\r\npeasantry, and by education and training came to look upon arms as their\r\nlegitimate profession. They naturally attached themselves to the military\r\ncommanders who led them in their various expeditions, and thus were in\r\ntime regarded as the standing troops of the empire. This growth of a\r\nmilitary class, whose commanders were restless and ambitious, gradually\r\nundermined the authority which the Fujiwara up to the tenth century had\r\nalmost unrestrictedly exercised. The employment of commanders from the\r\nmilitary families raised in them an ambition to share in the powers of\r\ngovernment. The struggles which ensued, first between the Fujiwara and\r\nTaira, and then between the Taira and Minamoto, continued to keep the\r\ncountry embroiled for more than a century. The suffering and desolation\r\nresulting from these weary internecine wars can only be paralleled by such\r\nconflicts as that between the White and Red Roses in England, or the\r\nThirty Years’ War in Germany. Of these struggles it will be possible to\r\ngive only an outline.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that the Taira family sprang from the\r\nEmperor Kwammu,(112) whose great-grandson, Takamochi received permission\r\nto take Taira as his family name. The Emperor Shirakawa tired of the\r\narrogance of the Fujiwara in A.D. 1087 retired into a cloister, and from\r\nthis seclusion continued to exercise a controlling influence in the\r\nconduct of affairs. Tadamori a descendant of Taira-no-Takamochi was a\r\nfavorite in his court, and even had a _liaison_ with one of his\r\nconcubines.\r\n\r\nThe ex-emperor complaisantly informed the courtier that if the child to be\r\nborn proved to be a daughter he himself would adopt it, but if a son then\r\nit should belong to Tadamori. Accordingly the child being a son was a\r\nTaira, and rose to great eminence as Taira-no-Kiyomori. Tadamori acquired\r\nfor himself great credit by his successful expedition against Korean\r\npirates who had cruised along the eastern coasts of Japan. In the troubles\r\nwhich subsequently arose in reference to the succession the Taira took an\r\nimportant part. The Emperor Toba, who succeeded to the throne in A.D. 1108\r\nat the age of six, abdicated in A.D. 1123 at the age of twenty-six. Both\r\nhis father, the ex-Emperor Horikawa, and his grandfather, the ex-Emperor\r\nShirakawa, were still living in retirement. He was succeeded by his son\r\nthe Emperor Shutoku in A.D. 1124, then six years old, who after reigning\r\nseventeen years abdicated. He had a son but was succeeded A.D. 1142 by his\r\nbrother Konoye who was four years of age. This mature youth reigned\r\nthirteen years and died without abdicating. On his death-bed he adopted as\r\nthe crown prince his brother Go-Shirakawa, thus displacing the lineal\r\nheir. The succession was now bitterly disputed. The Minamoto chiefly\r\nespoused the cause of the displaced heir, while Kiyomori and the Taira\r\ntogether with Minamoto-no-Yoshitomo supported Go-Shirakawa. In a battle\r\nfought A.D. 1156 Kyomori won the victory. This victory raised him to a\r\npinnacle of power. He began a career of nepotism and patronage which was\r\nnot inferior to that of the Fujiwara. The ex-Emperor Shutoku and his son\r\nwere banished to the province of Sanuki where it is said that Shutoku died\r\nof starvation. Tametomo a member of the Minamoto clan who was famed for\r\nhis great strength and for his skill in archery was sent as an exile to\r\nthe island of Hachijō, southeast of the promontory of Izu. From this\r\nisland he escaped, and it is a tradition that he made his way to the\r\nRyūkyū islands where he rose to prominence and became the ancestor of the\r\nkings of these islands.\r\n\r\nYoshitomo of the Minamoto clan, who had sided with Kiyomori in the recent\r\ndynastic conflict was a brother of the Tametomo just mentioned. He was\r\ngreatly offended by the violent use which Kiyomori made of the power which\r\nhad come into his hands. With all the Minamoto and Fujiwara he conspired\r\nto overthrow the victorious and arrogant Taira. But Kiyomori suspecting\r\nthe plans of his enemies took measures to counteract them and suddenly\r\nfell upon them in the city of Kyōto. Yoshitomo was obliged to save himself\r\nby fleeing to Owari, where he was assassinated by the agents of Kiyomori.\r\nThe death of the head of the Minamoto only made the tyrant more determined\r\nto crush all opposition. Even the ex-Emperor Go-Shirakawa, who was a\r\nson-in-law of Kiyomori, but who showed some signs of disapproval, was sent\r\ninto exile. Several of the sons of Yoshitomo were put to death; but\r\nYoritomo then a boy of thirteen was saved by the interference of the\r\nmother-in-law of Kiyomori, and was sent into exile in the province of Izu,\r\nand put into the safe-keeping of two faithful Taira men, one of whom Hōjō\r\nTokimasa will be heard of hereafter.\r\n\r\nBesides the four sons of Yoshitomo by his wife, he had also three sons by\r\na concubine named Tokiwa. She was a woman of great beauty, and for that\r\nreason as well as because she was the mother of the romantic hero\r\nYoshitsuné, she has often been chosen by Japanese artists as the subject\r\nof their pictures. Tokiwa and her three children, of whom Yoshitsuné was\r\nthen an infant at the breast, fled at the breaking out of the storm upon\r\nYoshitomo and the Minamoto clan. They are often represented as wandering\r\nthrough a storm of snow, Yoshitsuné being carried as an infant on the back\r\nof his mother, and the other two little ones pattering along with unequal\r\nsteps at her side. In this forlorn condition they were met by one of the\r\nTaira soldiers, who took pity on them and gave them shelter. From him they\r\nlearned that Kiyomori had taken the mother of Tokiwa prisoner, and held\r\nher in confinement, knowing that this would surely bring back to him the\r\nfair fugitive and her children. In the Chinese teachings of that day, in\r\nwhich Tokiwa had been educated, the duty of a child to its mother was\r\nparamount to that of a mother to her child. So Tokiwa felt that it was\r\nunquestionably her duty to go back at once to the capital and surrender\r\nherself in order to procure the release of her mother. But her maternal\r\nheart rebelled when she remembered that her babes would surely be\r\nsacrificed by this devotion. Her woman’s wit devised a scheme which might\r\npossibly furnish a way between these terrible alternatives. She determined\r\nto surrender herself and her children to Kiyomori, and depend upon her\r\nbeauty to save them from the fate which had been pronounced upon all the\r\nMinamoto. So with her little flock she went back and gave herself up to\r\nthe implacable tyrant. Softened by her beauty and urged by a number of his\r\ncourtiers, he set her mother at liberty in exchange for her becoming his\r\nconcubine, and distributed her children in separate monasteries. The chief\r\ninterest follows the youngest boy, Yoshitsuné, who was sent to the\r\nmonastery at Kurama Yama(113) near Kyōto. Here he grew up a vigorous and\r\nactive youth, more devoted to woodcraft, archery, and fencing than to the\r\nstudies and devotions of the monastery. At sixteen years of age he was\r\nurged by the priests to become a monk and to spend the rest of his days in\r\npraying for the soul of his father. But he refused, and shortly after he\r\nescaped from the monastery in company with a merchant who was about to\r\nvisit the northern provinces. Yoshitsuné reached Mutsu, where he entered\r\nthe service of Fujiwara-no-Hidehira, then governor of the province. Here\r\nhe spent several years devoting himself to the military duties which\r\nchiefly pertained to the government of that rough and barbarous province.\r\nHe developed into the gallant and accomplished soldier who played a\r\nprincipal part in the wars which followed, and became the national hero\r\naround whose name have clustered the choicest traditions of his country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as we have seen, Yoritomo,(114) the oldest son of Yoshitomo,\r\nand by inheritance the head of the Minamoto clan, had been banished to Izu\r\nand committed to the care of two faithful Taira adherents. Yoritomo\r\nmarried Masago, the daughter of Hōjō Tokimasa, one of these, and found\r\nmeans to induce Tokimasa to join him in his plans to overthrow the tyrant\r\nKiyomori, who now ruled the empire with relentless severity. Even the\r\nretired emperor joined in this conspiracy and wrote letters to Yoritomo\r\nurging him to lead in the attempt to put down the Taira. Yoritomo summoned\r\nthe scattered members of the Minamoto clan and all the disaffected\r\nelements of every kind to his assistance. It does not seem that this\r\nsummons was responded to with the alacrity which was hoped for. The\r\ninexperience of Yoritomo and the power and resources of him against whom\r\nthey were called upon to array themselves, led the scattered enemies of\r\nKiyomori to hesitate to join so hopeless a cause. The rendezvous of the\r\nMinamoto was at Ishibashi Yama, and it is said that only three hundred men\r\ngathered at the call. They were followed and attacked by a greatly\r\nsuperior force, and utterly routed. It is a tradition that Yoritomo and\r\nsix friends, who had escaped from the slaughter of this battle, hid\r\nthemselves in the hollow of an immense tree. Their pursuers, in searching\r\nfor them, sent one of their number to examine this tree. He was secretly a\r\nfriend of the Minamoto, and when he discovered the fugitives he told them\r\nto remain, and announced to those who sent him that the tree was empty. He\r\neven inserted his spear into the hollow and turned it about to show that\r\nthere was nothing there. When he did this two doves(115) flew out, and the\r\nartful soldier reported that spiders’ webs were in the mouth of the\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nYoritomo now fled to the promontory of Awa, east of what became known\r\nafterward as Yedo bay. He sent messages in every direction summoning the\r\nenemies of Kiyomori to join him. His brother Yoshitsuné gathered what\r\nforces he could from the north and marched to the region which was to\r\nbecome famous as the site of Kamakura. He was joined by others of his clan\r\nand soon felt himself in such a position as to assume the aggressive. He\r\nfixed upon Kamakura as his headquarters about A.D. 1180, and as his power\r\nincreased it grew to be a great city. It was difficult of access from\r\nKyōto and by fortifying the pass of Hakoné,(116) where the mountainous\r\nregions of Shinano come down to the eastern coast not far from Fujisan, it\r\nwas rendered safe from attacks coming from the south.\r\n\r\nWhile these notes of preparation were being sounded Kiyomori, who as\r\n_daijō-daijin_ had ruled the empire for many years, died A.D. 1181, at the\r\nage of sixty-four. He was fully aware of the portentous clouds which were\r\ngathering around his family. On his death-bed he is said to have warned\r\nthem of the danger arising from the plans of Yoritomo. According to the\r\n_Nihon-Gwaishi_, he said, “My regret is only that I am dying, and have not\r\nyet seen the head of Yoritomo of the Minamoto. After my decease do not\r\nmake offerings to Buddha on my behalf nor read sacred books. Only cut off\r\nthe head of Yoritomo of the Minamoto and hang it on my tomb.”\r\n\r\nThe death of Kiyomori(117) hastened the triumph of Yoritomo. Munemori the\r\nson of Kiyomori became the head of the Taira clan, and continued the\r\ncontest. But Yoritomo’s combinations speedily reduced the country to his\r\npower. Yoshitsuné with his army from the north was at Kamakura; Yoshinaka,\r\na cousin of Yoritomo, was in command of an army gathered in the highlands\r\nof Shinano; while Yoritomo himself led the forces collected in Awa, Kazusa\r\nand Musashi. The point to which all the armies were directed was the\r\ncapital where the Taira were still in full control. Yoshinaka was the\r\nfirst to come in collision with the forces of the capital. Munemori had\r\nsent out an army to oppose Yoshinaka who was swiftly approaching along the\r\nNakasendō. The Taira army was completely defeated and Yoshinaka marched\r\nvictoriously into the capital. Munemori with the reigning emperor Antoku,\r\nthen only a child six years of age, and all the imperial court crossed the\r\nInland sea to Sanuki, the northern province of the island of Shikoku. The\r\ntwo retired emperors Go-Shirakawa, and Takakura who sympathized with the\r\nrevolutionary movements of Yoritomo, remained behind and welcomed\r\nYoshinaka to the capital. The retirement of the emperor from the palace\r\nwas taken as his abdication, and his younger brother, Go-Toba, then seven\r\nyears old, was proclaimed emperor.\r\n\r\nYoshinaka, puffed up by his rapid success, and disregarding the paramount\r\nposition of Yoritomo, assumed the superintendence of the government and\r\nhad himself appointed _sei-i-shōgun_,(118) which was the highest military\r\ntitle then bestowed upon a subject. He even went so far as to antagonize\r\nYoritomo and undertook to pluck the fruits of the military movements which\r\nhad brought about this revolution of the government.\r\n\r\nYoritomo at once despatched Yoshitsuné at the head of his army to Kyōto to\r\nput down this most unexpected and unnatural defection. He met Yoshinaka’s\r\narmy near lake Biwa and inflicted upon it a severe defeat. Overwhelmed\r\nwith shame and knowing that he deserved no consideration at the hands of\r\nhis outraged relatives, Yoshinaka committed suicide. Yoshitsuné then\r\nfollowed the fugitive court. He destroyed the Taira palace at Hyōgo, and\r\nthen crossed over to Sanuki, whither the court had fled. Alarmed by the\r\nswift vengeance which was pursuing them, Munemori together with the\r\nemperor and his mother and all the court hastily embarked for what they\r\nhoped might be an asylum in the island of Kyūshū. They were pursued by the\r\nMinamoto army in the junks which had brought them to Sanuki. They were\r\novertaken at Dan-no-ura not far from the village of Shimonoseki, in the\r\nnarrow straits at the western extremity of the Inland sea. The naval\r\nbattle which here took place is the most famous in the annals of the\r\nJapanese empire. According to the _Nihon-Gwaishi_ the Taira fleet\r\nconsisted of five hundred junks, and the Minamoto of seven hundred. The\r\nvessels of the Taira were encumbered by many women and children of the\r\nescaping families, which put them at a great disadvantage. The young\r\nemperor, with his mother and grandmother, were also the precious freight\r\nof this fugitive fleet. Of course, at this early date the vessels which\r\ncontended were unlike the monstrous men-of-war which now make naval\r\nwarfare so stupendous a game. They were not even to be compared with the\r\nvessels which made up the Spanish Armada in A.D. 1588, or the ships in\r\nwhich the gallant British sailors repulsed them. Cannon were no part of\r\ntheir armament. The men fought with bows and arrows, and with spears and\r\nswords. It was, however, a terrible hand-to-hand fight between men who\r\nfelt that their all was at stake. Story-tellers draw from this battle some\r\nof their most lurid narratives, and artists have depicted it with\r\nrealistic horrors. The grandmother of the emperor, the widow of Kiyomori,\r\nseeing that escape was impossible, took the boy emperor in her arms, and\r\nin spite of the remonstrances of her daughter, who was the boy’s mother,\r\nshe plunged into the sea, and both were drowned.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the Taira perished in this battle, but a remnant escaped\r\nto the island of Kyūshū and hid themselves in the inaccessible valleys of\r\nthe province of Higo. Here they have been recognized in recent times, and\r\nit is claimed that they still show the surly aversion to strangers which\r\nis an inheritance derived from the necessity under which they long rested\r\nto hide themselves from the vengeance which pursued them.(119)\r\n\r\nThis battle was decisive in the question of supremacy between the Taira\r\nand Minamoto clans. The same policy of extermination which Kiyomori had\r\npursued against the Minamoto was now remorselessly enforced by the\r\nMinamoto against the Taira. The prisoners who were taken in the battle\r\nwere executed to the last man. Munemori was taken prisoner and\r\ndecapitated. Whenever a Taira man, woman, or child was found, death was\r\nthe inevitable penalty inflicted. Yoritomo stationed his father-in-law\r\nHōjō Tokimasa at Kyōto to search out and eradicate his enemies as well as\r\nto supervise the affairs of the government.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Go-Toba, a mere child (A.D. 1186) only seven\r\nyears of age, had been put on the throne, in the place of the fugitive\r\nAntoku. Now that the latter had perished at Dan-no-ura, there could be no\r\nquestion about the legitimacy and regularity of Go-Toba’s accession. The\r\nretired Emperor Go-Shirakawa, who had been a friend and promoter of the\r\nschemes of Yoritomo, was still alive, and rendered important aid in the\r\nre-organization of the government.\r\n\r\nThe darkest blot upon the character of Yoritomo is his treatment of his\r\nyoungest brother Yoshitsuné. It was he who had by his generalship and\r\ngallantry brought these terrible wars to a triumphant conclusion. He had\r\ncrushed in the decisive battle of Dan-no-ura the last of the enemies of\r\nYoritomo. With his victorious troops he marched northward, and with\r\nprisoners and captured standards was on his way to lay them at the feet of\r\nhis now triumphant brother at Kamakura. But the demon of jealousy had\r\ntaken possession of Yoritomo. He resented the success and fame of his more\r\nwinning and heroic brother. He sent orders to him not to enter Kamakura,\r\nand to give up his trophies of battle at Koshigoye near to Enoshima. Here\r\nat the monastery of Mampukuji is still kept the draft of the touching\r\nletter(120) which he sent to his brother, protesting his loyalty and\r\ndenying the charges of ambition and self-seeking which had been made\r\nagainst him. But all this availed nothing. Yoshitsuné returned to Kyōto\r\nand, in fear of bodily harm from the machinations of his brother, made his\r\nescape with his faithful servant Benkei,(121) into his old asylum with his\r\nfriend Fujiwara Hidehira the governor of Mutsu. Shortly after his arrival,\r\nhowever, Hidehira died, and his son Yasuhira abjectly connived at his\r\nassassination(122) A.D. 1189, with a view to secure Yoritomo’s favor. He\r\nwas at the time of his death only thirty years of age. He has lived down\r\nto the present time in the admiring affection of a warlike and heroic\r\npeople. Although Yoritomo is looked upon as perhaps their greatest hero,\r\nyet their admiration is always coupled with a _proviso_ concerning his\r\ncruel treatment of his brother.\r\n\r\nIn order not to rest under the imputation of having encouraged this\r\nassassination, Yoritomo marched at the head of a strong force and\r\ninflicted punishment upon Yasuhira for having done what he himself desired\r\nbut dared not directly authorize.\r\n\r\nThe way was now clear for Yoritomo to establish a system of government\r\nwhich should secure to him and his family the fruits of his long contest.\r\nIn A.D. 1190, he went up to the capital to pay his respects to the Emperor\r\nGo-Toba as well as to the veteran retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa. The latter\r\nwas now in his sixty-sixth year, and had held his place through five\r\nsuccessive reigns, and was now the friend and patron of the new\r\ngovernment. He died, however, only two years later. Yoritomo knew the\r\neffect produced by a magnificent display, and therefore made his progress\r\nto the capital with all the pomp and circumstance which he could command.\r\nThe festivities were kept up for a month, and the court and its\r\nsurroundings were deeply impressed with a sense of the power and\r\nirresistible authority of the head of the Minamoto clan.\r\n\r\nYoritomo did not, however, choose to establish himself at Kyōto amid the\r\natmosphere of effeminacy which surrounded the court. After his official\r\nvisit, during which every honor and rank which could be bestowed by the\r\nemperor were showered upon his head and all his family and friends, he\r\nreturned to his own chosen seat at Kamakura. Here he busied himself in\r\nperfecting a system which, while it would perpetuate his own power, would\r\nalso build up a firm national government.\r\n\r\nHis first step, A.D. 1184, was to establish a council at which affairs of\r\nstate were discussed, and which furnished a medium through which the\r\nadministration might be conducted. The president of this council was\r\nŌye-no-Hiromoto.(123) Its jurisdiction pertained at first to the\r\nKwantō—that is, to the part of the country east of the Hakoné barrier.\r\nThis region was more completely under the control of the Minamoto, and\r\ntherefore could be more easily and surely submitted to administrative\r\nmethods. He also established a criminal tribunal to take cognizance of\r\nrobberies and other crimes which, during the lawless and violent\r\ndisturbances in the country, had largely prevailed.\r\n\r\nBut the step, which was destined to produce the most far-reaching results,\r\nconsisted in his obtaining from the emperor the appointment of five of his\r\nown family as governors of provinces, promising on his part to supervise\r\ntheir actions and to be responsible for the due performance of their duty.\r\nUp to this time the governors and vice-governors of provinces had always\r\nbeen appointed from civil life and were taken from the families\r\nsurrounding the imperial court. He also was authorized to send into each\r\nprovince a military man, who was to reside there, to aid the governor in\r\nmilitary affairs. Naturally, the military man, being the more active,\r\ngradually absorbed much of the power formerly exercised by the governor.\r\nThese military men were under the authority of Yoritomo and formed the\r\nbeginning of that feudal system which was destined to prevail so long in\r\nJapan. He also received from the court, shortly after his visit to Kyōto,\r\nthe title of _sei-i-tai-shōgun_, which was the highest military title\r\nwhich had ever been bestowed on a subject. This is the title which, down\r\nto A.D. 1868, was borne by the real rulers of Japan. The possession of the\r\npower implied by this title enabled Yoritomo to introduce responsible\r\ngovernment into the almost ungoverned districts of the empire, and to give\r\nto Japan for the first time in many centuries a semblance of peace.\r\n\r\nThere were also many minor matters of administration which Yoritomo, in\r\nthe few remaining years of his life, put in order. He obtained from the\r\nemperor permission to levy a tax on the agricultural products of the\r\ncountry, from which he defrayed the expenses of the military government.\r\nHe established tribunals for the hearing and determining of causes, and\r\nthus secured justice in the ordinary affairs of life. He forbade the\r\npriests and monks in the great Buddhist monasteries, who had become\r\npowerful and arrogant, to bear arms, or to harbor those bearing arms.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                Yoritomo.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all these administrative reforms Yoritomo was careful always to secure\r\nthe assent and authority of the imperial court.(124) In no case did he\r\nassume or exercise independent authority. In this way was introduced at\r\nthis time that system of dual government which continued until the\r\nresignation of the Tokugawa Shōgun in 1868. After his first visit to\r\nKyōto, in A.D. 1190, Yoritomo devoted the remaining years of his life to\r\nthe confirmation of his power and the encouragement of the arts of peace.\r\nIn A.D. 1195 he made a second magnificent visit to Kyōto and remained four\r\nmonths. It is because of these peaceful results, which followed the long\r\ninternecine struggles, that the Japanese regard Yoritomo as one of their\r\nmost eminent and notable men. Under the influence of his court Kamakura\r\ngrew to be a great city and far outranked even Kyōto in power and\r\nactivity, though not in size.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the year A.D. 1198, when returning from the inspection of\r\na new bridge over the Sagami river, he had a fall from his horse which\r\nseriously injured him. He died from the effects of this fall in the early\r\npart of the following year, in the fifty-third year of his age. He had\r\nwielded the unlimited military power for the last fifteen years. His death\r\nwas almost as much of an epoch in the history of Japan as his life had\r\nbeen. We shall see in the chapters which follow the deplorable results of\r\nthat system of effeminacy and nepotism, of abdication and regency, which\r\nYoritomo had to resist, and which, had he lived twenty years more, his\r\ncountry might have escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. EMPEROR AND SHŌGUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Yoritomo brought into prominence the very same system which\r\nhad been the bane of the imperial house during many centuries. His son and\r\nthe hereditary successor to his position and power was Yoriiye, then\r\neighteen years of age. He was the son of Masago, and therefore the\r\ngrandson of Hōjō Tokimasa, who had been Yoritomo’s chief friend and\r\nadviser. He was an idle, vicious boy, and evinced no aptitude to carry on\r\nthe work of his father. In this wayward career he was not checked by his\r\ngrandfather, and is even said to have been encouraged to pursue a life of\r\npleasure and gayety, while the earnest work of the government was\r\ntransacted by others. Tokimasa assumed the duties of president of the\r\nCouncil as well as guardian of Yoriiye, and in these capacities conducted\r\nthe administration entirely according to his own will. The appointments of\r\nposition and rank which the father had received from the emperor were in\r\nlike manner bestowed upon the son. He was made head of the military\r\nadministrators stationed in the several provinces, and he also received\r\nthe military title of _sei-i-tai-shōgun_, to which Yoritomo had been\r\nappointed. But these appointments were only honorary, and the duties\r\npertaining to them were all performed by the guardian of the young man.\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 1203, that is in the fourth year succeeding Yoritomo’s\r\ndeath, Yoriiye was taken sick, and was unable to fulfil his duties even in\r\nthe feeble manner which was customary. His mother consulted with Tokimasa,\r\nand they agreed that Yoriiye should abdicate and surrender the headship of\r\nthe military administration to his brother Semman, who was twelve years of\r\nage, and his son Ichiman. Yoriiye seems to have resisted these\r\nsuggestions, and even resorted to force to free himself from the influence\r\nof the Hōjō. But Tokimasa was too powerful to be so easily dispensed with.\r\nYoriiye was compelled to yield, and he retired to a monastery and gave up\r\nhis offices. Not content with this living retirement, Tokimasa contrived\r\nto have him assassinated. Semman, his brother, was appointed\r\n_sei-i-tai-shōgun_, and his name changed to Sanetomo. But Sanetomo did not\r\nlong enjoy his promotion, because his nephew, the son of his murdered\r\npredecessor, deemed him responsible for his father’s murder, and took\r\noccasion to assassinate him. Then in turn the nephew was put to death for\r\nthis crime, and thus by the year A.D. 1219 the last of the descendants of\r\nthe great Yoritomo had perished. In the meantime Tokimasa had, A.D. 1205,\r\nretired to a Buddhist monastery in his sixty-eighth year, and in A.D.\r\n1216, when he was seventy-eight, he died. The court at Kamakura was now\r\nprepared to go on in its career of effeminacy after the pattern of that at\r\nKyōto.\r\n\r\nMesago, the widow of Yoritomo and daughter of Tokimasa, although she too\r\nhad taken refuge in a Buddhist nunnery, continued to exercise a ruling\r\ncontrol in the affairs of the government. She solicited from the court at\r\nKyōto the appointment of Yoritsuné, a boy of the Fujiwara family, only two\r\nyears old, as _sei-i-tai-shōgun_ in the place of the murdered Sanetomo.\r\nThe petition was granted, and this child was entrusted to the care of the\r\nHōjō, who, as regents(125) of the shōgun, exercised with unlimited sway\r\nthe authority of this great office. The situation of affairs in Japan at\r\nthis time was deplorable. Go-Toba and Tsuchi-mikado were both living in\r\nretirement as ex-emperors. Juntoku was the reigning emperor, who was under\r\nthe influence and tutelage of the ex-Emperor Go-Toba. Fretting under the\r\narrogance of the Hōjō, Go-Toba undertook to resist their claims. But\r\nYoshitoku, the Hōjō regent at this time, quickly brought the Kyōto court\r\nto terms by the use of his military power. The ex-Emperor Go-Toba was\r\ncompelled to become a monk, and was exiled to the island of Oki. The\r\nEmperor Juntoku was forced to abdicate, and was banished to Sado, and a\r\ngrandson of the former Emperor Takakura placed on the throne. Even the\r\nex-Emperor Tsuchi-mikado, who had not taken any part in the conspiracy,\r\nwas sent off to the island of Shikoku. The lands that had belonged to the\r\nimplicated nobles were confiscated and distributed by Yoshitoku among his\r\nown adherents. The power of the Hōjō family was thus raised to its supreme\r\npoint. They ruled both at Kyōto and Kamakura with resistless authority.\r\nThey exercised at both places this authority without demanding or\r\nreceiving the appointment to any of the high positions which they might\r\nhave claimed. They were only the regents of young and immature shōguns,\r\nwho were the appointees of a court which had at its head an emperor\r\nwithout power or influence, and which was controlled by the creatures of\r\ntheir own designation. This lamentable state of things lasted for many\r\nyears. The shōguns during all this time were children sent from Kyōto,\r\nsons of emperors or connections of the royal family. The Hōjō ruled them\r\nas well as the country. Whenever it seemed best, they relentlessly deposed\r\nthem, and set up others in their places. In A.D. 1289 the Regent Sadatoki,\r\nit is said, became irritated with one of these semi-royal shōguns, named\r\nKoreyasu, and in order to show his contempt for him, had him put in a\r\n_nori-mono_(126) with his heels upward, and sent him under guard to Kyōto.\r\nSome of the Hōjō regents, however, were men of character and efficiency.\r\nYasutoki, for instance, who became regent in A.D. 1225, was a man of\r\nnotable executive ability, taking Yoritomo as his model. Besides being a\r\nsoldier of tried capacity, he was a true friend of the farmer in his\r\nseasons of famine and trial, and a promoter of legal reforms and of the\r\narts, which found a congenial home among the Japanese.\r\n\r\nBut this condition of affairs could not last always. The very same\r\ninfluences which put the real power into the hands of the regents were at\r\nwork to render them unfit to continue to wield it. Abdication and\r\neffeminacy were gradually dragging down the Hōjō family to the same level\r\nas that of the shōguns and emperors. In A.D. 1256 Tokiyori, then only\r\nthirty years old, resigned the regency in favor of his son Tokimune, who\r\nwas only six years. He himself retired to a monastery, from which he\r\ntravelled as a visiting monk throughout the country. In the meantime his\r\nson was under the care of a tutor, Nagatoki, who, of course, was one of\r\nthe Hōjō family. Thus it had come about that a tutor now controlled the\r\nregent; who was supposed to control the shōgun; who was supposed to be the\r\nvassal of the emperor; who in turn was generally a child under the control\r\nof a corrupt and venal court. Truly government in Japan had sunk to its\r\nlowest point, and it was time for heroic remedies!\r\n\r\nOccasionally, in the midst of this corruption and inefficiency, an event\r\noccurs which stirs up the national enthusiasm and makes us feel that there\r\nis still left an element of heroism which will ultimately redeem the\r\nnation from impending ruin. Such was the Mongolian invasion of Japan in\r\nA.D. 1281. According to accounts given by Marco Polo, who evidently\r\nnarrates the exaggerated gossip of the Chinese court,(127) Kublai Khan had\r\nat this time conquered the Sung dynasty in China and reigned with\r\nunexampled magnificence. He had heard of the wealth of Japan and deemed it\r\nan easy matter to add this island empire to his immense dominions. His\r\nfirst step was to despatch an embassy to the Japanese court to demand the\r\nsubjection of the country to his authority. This embassy was referred to\r\nKamakura, whence it was indignantly dismissed. Finally he sent an invading\r\nforce in a large number of Chinese and Korean vessels who took possession\r\nof Tsushima, an island belonging to Japan and lying midway between Korea\r\nand Japan. Trusting to the effects of this success a new embassy was sent,\r\nwhich was brought before the Hōjō regent at Kamakura. The spot on the\r\nseashore is still pointed out where these imperious ambassadors were put\r\nto death, and thus a denial which could not be misunderstood was given to\r\nthe demands of the Grand Khan. A great invading force, which the Japanese\r\nput at a hundred thousand men, was immediately sent in more than three\r\nhundred vessels, who landed upon the island of Kyūshū. This army was met\r\nand defeated(128) by Tokimune, and, a timely typhoon coming to their aid,\r\nthe fleet of vessels was completely destroyed. Thus the only serious\r\nattempt at the invasion of Japan which has ever been made was completely\r\nfrustrated.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this heroic episode the affairs of Japan remained in\r\nthe same deplorable condition. As a rule children continued to occupy the\r\nimperial throne and to abdicate whenever their Hōjō masters deemed it\r\nbest. Children of the imperial house or of the family of Fujiwara were\r\nsent to Kamakura to become shōguns. And now at last the Hōjō regency had\r\nby successive steps come down to the same level, and children were made\r\nregents, whose actions and conduct were controlled by their inferiors.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this state of things, which continued till A.D. 1318,\r\nGo-Daigo became emperor. Contrary to the ordinary usage, he was a man\r\nthirty-one years old, in the full maturity of his powers. He was by no\r\nmeans free from the vices to which his surroundings inevitably tended. He\r\nwas fond of the gayety and pomp which the court had always cultivated. But\r\nhe realized the depth of the degradation to which the present condition of\r\naffairs had dragged his country. A famine brought great suffering upon the\r\npeople, and the efforts which the emperor made to assist them added to his\r\npopularity, and revealed to him the reverence in which the imperial throne\r\nwas held. His son Moriyoshi, as early as A.D. 1307, was implicated in\r\nplans against the Hōjō, which they discovered, and in consequence\r\ncompelled Go-Daigo to order his retirement into a monastery. Later\r\nGo-Daigo undertook to make a stand against the arrogance and intolerance\r\nof the Hōjō and induced the Buddhist monks to join him in fortifying\r\nKasagi in the province of Yamato. But this effort of the emperor was\r\nfruitless. Kasagi was attacked and destroyed and the emperor taken\r\nprisoner. As a punishment for his attempt he was sent as an exile to the\r\nisland of Oki. The Hōjō Regent Takatoki put Go-Kōgen on the throne as\r\nemperor. But Go-Daigo from his exile continued his exertions against the\r\nHōjō, and assistance came to him from unexpected quarters. He effected his\r\nescape from the island and, having raised an army, marched upon Kyōto.\r\nKusunoki Masashigé, who had given his aid to the emperor on former\r\noccasions, now exerted himself to good purpose. He is held in admiring\r\nremembrance to this day by his grateful country as the model of patriotic\r\ndevotion, to whom his emperor was dearer than his life. Another character\r\nwho stands out prominently in this trying time was Nitta Yoshisada. He was\r\na descendant of Yoshiiye, who, for his achievements against the Emishi,\r\nhad received the popular title of Hachiman-tarō. Nitta was a commander in\r\nthe army of the Hōjō, which had been sent against Kusunoki Masashigé. But\r\nat the last moment he refused to fight against the army of the emperor and\r\nretired with his troops and went over to the side of Masashigé. He\r\nreturned to his own province of Kōtsuke and raised an army to fight\r\nagainst the Hōjō. With this force he marched at once against Kamakura\r\nthrough the province of Sagami. His route lay along the beach. But at\r\nInamura-ga-saki the high ground, which is impassable for troops, juts out\r\nso far into the water that Nitta was unable to lead them past the\r\npromontory. Alone he clambered up the mountain path and looked out upon\r\nthe sea that lay in his way. He was bitterly disappointed that he could\r\nnot bring his force in time to share in the attack upon the hateful Hōjō\r\ncapital. He prayed to the Sea-god to withdraw the sea and allow him to\r\npass with his troops. Then he flung his sword into the waves in token of\r\nhis earnestness and of the dire necessity in which he found himself.\r\nThereupon the tide retreated and left a space of a mile and a half, along\r\nwhich Nitta(129) marched upon Kamakura.\r\n\r\nThe attack was spirited and was made from three directions simultaneously.\r\nIt was resisted with determined valor on the part of the Hōjō. The city\r\nwas finally set on fire by Nitta, and in a few hours was reduced to ashes.\r\nThus the power and the arrogant tyranny of the Hōjō family were sealed. It\r\nhad lasted from the death of Yoritomo, A.D. 1199, to the destruction of\r\nKamakura, A.D. 1333, in all one hundred and thirty-four years. It was a\r\nrough and tempestuous time and the Hōjō have left a name in their country\r\nof unexampled cruelty and rapacity. The most unpardonable crime of which\r\nthey were guilty was that of raising their sacrilegious hands against the\r\nemperor and making war against the imperial standard. For this they must\r\nrest under the charge of treason, and no merits however great or\r\ncommanding can ever excuse them in the eyes of their patriotic countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of Go-Daigo to the imperial throne, under so popular an\r\nuprising, seemed to betoken a return to the old and simple system of\r\nJapanese government. The intervention of a shōgun between the emperor and\r\nhis people, which had lasted from the time of Yoritomo, was contrary to\r\nthe precedents which had prevailed from the Emperor Jimmu down to that\r\ntime. It was the hope and wish of the best friends of the government at\r\nthis time to go back to the original precedents and govern the country\r\ndirectly from Kyōto with the power and authority derived from the emperor.\r\nBut the emperor was not equal to so radical a change from the methods\r\nwhich had prevailed for more than a century. He gave great offence by the\r\nmanner in which he distributed the forfeited fiefs among those who had\r\naided his restoration. To Ashikaga Taka-uji he awarded by far the greatest\r\nprize, while to Kusunoki and Nitta, who had in the popular estimation done\r\nmuch more for him, he allotted comparatively small rewards. Among the\r\nsoldiers, who in the long civil wars had lost the ability to devote\r\nthemselves to peaceful industries, this disappointment was most\r\nconspicuous. They had expected to be rewarded with lands and subordinate\r\nplaces, which would enable them to live in that feudal comfort to which\r\nthey deemed their exertions had entitled them.\r\n\r\nAt this time a feud broke out between Ashikaga Taka-uji and Nitta. The\r\nformer had accused Nitta of unfaithfulness to his emperor and Nitta was\r\nable to disprove the charge. He received the imperial commission to punish\r\nAshikaga and marched with his army upon him in the province of Tōtōmi. In\r\nthe battles (A.D. 1336) which ensued, the forces of Ashikaga were\r\ncompletely victorious. The emperor and his court were obliged to flee from\r\nKyōto and took up their residence in a Buddhist temple at Yoshino in the\r\nmountainous district south of Kyōto. This was the same monastery where\r\nYoshitsuné and Benkei had taken refuge previous to their escape into\r\nMutsu. Almost every tree and every rock in the picturesque grounds of this\r\nromantic spot(130) bear some evidence of the one or other of these\r\nmemorable refugees. The southern dynasty lasted in all fifty-seven years,\r\ndown to A.D. 1374, and although it was compelled to starve out a miserable\r\nexistence in exile from the capital, it is yet looked upon by historians\r\nas the legitimate branch; while the northern dynasty, which enjoyed the\r\nluxury of a palace and of the capital, is condemned as illegitimate.\r\n\r\nThis period of exile witnessed many notable events in the bloody history\r\nof the country. Ashikaga Taka-uji was of course the ruling spirit while he\r\nlived. He proclaimed that Go-Daigo had forfeited the throne and put Kōmyō\r\nTennō, a brother of Kōgen Tennō upon it in his stead. The insignia of the\r\nimperial power were in the possession of Go-Daigo, but Kōmyō, being\r\nsupported by the battalions of Ashikaga, cared little for these empty\r\nbaubles. The bloody sequence of affairs brought with it the death of the\r\nheroic Kusunoki Masashige. He with Nitta and other patriots had undertaken\r\nto support Go-Daigo. It is said that contrary to his military judgment he\r\nattacked the forces of Ashikaga, which were vastly superior in number. The\r\nbattle took place A.D. 1336, on the Minato-gawa, near the present site of\r\nHyōgo. The Ashikaga forces had cut off Kusunoki with a small band of\r\ndevoted followers from the main army. Seeing that his situation was\r\nhopeless and that his brave troops must be destroyed, with one hundred and\r\nfifty men—all that were left of his little army—he retired to a farmer’s\r\nhouse near by and there they all committed _hara-kiri_.(131) Kusunoki\r\nMasashige, when about to commit suicide, said to his son Masatsura: “For\r\nthe sake of keeping yourself out of danger’s way or of reaping some\r\ntemporal advantage, on no account are you to submit to Taka-uji. By so\r\ndoing you would bring reproach on our name. While there is a man left who\r\nbelongs to us let our flag be hoisted over the battlements of Mount Konzo,\r\nas a sign that we are still ready to fight in the emperor’s cause.”\r\n\r\nA little later than this, in A.D. 1338, the great companion and friend of\r\nKusunoki, Nitta Yoshisada, came to his end. He had undertaken to promote\r\nthe cause of the Emperor Go-Daigo in the northwestern provinces by\r\nco-operating with Fuji-wara-no-Yoritomo. Nitta with about fifty followers\r\nwas unexpectedly attacked by Ashikaga Tadatsune, with three thousand men\r\nnear Fukui in the province of Echizen. There was no way of escape with his\r\nlittle troop. In this condition he was urged to secure his personal\r\nsafety. But he refused to survive his comrades. Then he rode with his\r\nbrave company upon the enemy until his horse was disabled and he himself\r\nwas pierced in the eye with an arrow. He drew out the arrow with his own\r\nhand, and then, in order that his body might not be identified, with his\r\nsword cut off his own head, at least so it is said! Each member of his\r\ntroop followed this grewsome example, and it was only after examining the\r\nbodies of these headless corpses and the finding upon one a commission\r\nfrom the Emperor Go-Daigo, that the remains of the heroic Nitta were\r\nrecognized. The head was sent to Kyōto and there exposed by the Ashikaga\r\ncommander, and the body was buried near the place where the tragic death\r\noccurred.(132)\r\n\r\nThe Ashikaga family had now the uninterrupted control of affairs. They\r\nresided at Kyōto and inherited in succession the office of shōgun.\r\nTaka-uji, the founder of the Ashikaga shōgunate, and who had held the\r\noffice from A.D. 1334, died in A.D. 1358, when about fifty-three years\r\nold. He was succeeded by his son Yoshinori who was shōgun from A.D. 1359\r\nto A.D. 1367. Having retired he was succeeded by his grandson Yoshimitsu\r\nwho in turn retired in favor of his son Yoshimotsu. By this time the\r\nprecedents of abdication and effeminacy began to tell upon the Ashikaga\r\nsuccessors, and like all the preceding ruling families it gradually sank\r\ninto the usual insignificance. Some of the Ashikaga shōguns, however, were\r\nmen of uncommon ability and their services to their country deserve to be\r\ngratefully remembered. A number of them were men of culture and evinced\r\ntheir love of elegance and refinement by the palaces which they built in\r\nKyōto. Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was shōgun from A.D. 1368 to 1393, and at the\r\nlatter date retired in favor of his young son Yoshimotsu, but lived in\r\nofficial retirement in Kyōto till A.D. 1409. He built the palace now known\r\nas the Buddhist monastery Kinkakuji.(133) Its name is derived from\r\n_kinkaku_ (golden pavilion) which Yoshimitsu erected. The whole palace was\r\nbequeathed by him to the Zen sect of Buddhists and is still one of the\r\nsights best worth seeing in Kyōto.\r\n\r\nYoshimitsu has been visited by much obloquy because he accepted from the\r\nChinese government the title of King of Japan, and pledged himself to the\r\npayment of one thousand ounces of gold as a yearly tribute. It is said in\r\nexplanation of this tribute that it was to compensate for damages done by\r\nJapanese pirates to Chinese shipping. But it was probably negotiated for\r\nthe purpose of securing an ambitious title on the one hand and on the\r\nother making a troublesome neighbor a tributary kingdom.\r\n\r\nAnother building which takes its origin from the Ashikaga is the Tō-ji-in.\r\nIt was founded by Ashikaga Taka-uji and contains carved and lacquered\r\nwooden figures of the Ashikaga shōguns which are believed in most cases to\r\nbe contemporary portraits.(134)\r\n\r\nAnother of the notable Ashikaga shōguns was Yoshimasa, who held the office\r\nfrom A.D. 1443-1473. He retired at the latter date, and lived as retired\r\nshōgun until A.D. 1490. In this interval of seclusion he cultivated the\r\narts, and posed as the patron of literature and painting. That curious\r\ncustom called _cha-no-yu_, or tea ceremonies,(135) is usually adjudged to\r\nhim as its originator, but it is most probable that he only adopted and\r\nrefined it until it became the fashionable craze which has come down to\r\nmodern times. These ceremonies and his other modes of amusement were\r\nconducted in a palace which he had built called _gin-kaku_ (silver\r\npavilion). Yoshimasa left this palace to the monks of Shō-koku-ji, with\r\ndirections that it should be converted into a monastery, and in that\r\ncapacity it still serves at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe period of the two imperial dynasties lasted until A.D. 1392, when a\r\nproposition was made by the Shōgun Yoshimitsu to the then reigning emperor\r\nof the south, that the rivalry should be healed. It was agreed that\r\nGo-Kameyama of the southern dynasty should come to Kyōto and surrender the\r\ninsignia to Go-Komatsu, the ruling emperor of the northern dynasty. This\r\nwas duly accomplished, and Go-Kameyama, having handed over the insignia to\r\nGo-Komatsu, took the position of retired emperor. Thus the long rivalry\r\nbetween the northern and southern dynasties was ended, and Go-Komatsu\r\nstands as the ninety-ninth in the official list of emperors. In that list,\r\nhowever, none of the other emperors(136) of the northern dynasty appear,\r\nthey being regarded as pretenders, and in no case entitled to the dignity\r\nof divine rulers of Japan.\r\n\r\nThis settlement of dynastic difficulties and the unrestricted ascendancy\r\nof the Ashikaga shōguns gave the country a little interval of peace. The\r\ncondition of the peasantry at this time was most deplorable. The continual\r\nwars between neighboring lords and with the shōguns had kept in the field\r\narmies of military men, who were forced to subsist on contributions\r\nexacted from the tillers of the soil. The farmers everywhere were kept in\r\na state of uncertainty, and had little encouragement to cultivate crops\r\nwhich were almost sure to fall into the hands of others.\r\n\r\nOn the coasts of Kyūshū and other islands facing towards the continent\r\npiracy also sprang up and flourished apace. It was indeed an era of piracy\r\nall over the world. The Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch traders of this\r\nperiod were almost always ready to turn an honest penny by seizing an\r\nunfortunate vessel under the pretence that it was a pirate. The whole\r\ncoast of China, according to the accounts of Pinto, swarmed with both\r\nEuropean and Asiatic craft, which were either traders or pirates,\r\naccording to circumstances. Under this state of things, and with the\r\npressure of lawlessness and want behind them, it was not surprising that\r\nthe inhabitants of the western coasts of Japan should turn to a piratical\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nKnowing the Japanese only since centuries of enforced isolation had made\r\nthem unaccustomed to creep beyond their own shores, we can scarcely\r\nconceive of their hardihood and venturesomeness during and subsequent to\r\nthis active period. Mr. Satow(137) has gathered a most interesting series\r\nof facts pertaining to the intercourse between Japan and Siam, beginning\r\nat a period as early as that now under review. Not only did this\r\nintercourse consist in sending vessels laden with chattels for traffic,\r\nbut a colony of Japanese and a contingent of Japanese troops formed part\r\nof the assistance which Japan furnished to her southern neighbor.\r\n\r\nWhile these signs of activity were apparent on the coast, the provinces in\r\nthe interior were alive with political unrest. Particularly the principal\r\ndaimyōs, who had never since the days of Yoritomo felt a master’s power\r\nover them, took the present occasion to extend their dominions over their\r\nneighbors. For centuries the conflicts among them were almost unending. It\r\nis needless to undertake to disentangle the story of their wars. These\r\ndaimyōs were a far more distinct and pressing reality than the harmless\r\nemperor, or even than the far-removed shōgun. While their ceaseless civil\r\nwars rendered the condition of the country so uncertain and so unsettled,\r\nyet the authority of the local rulers tended to preserve peace and\r\ndispense a rude kind of justice among their own subjects. Thus while in\r\nmany parts of Japan poverty and desolation had eaten up everything, and\r\nlawlessness and robbery had put an end to industry, yet there were some\r\nfavored parts of the islands where the strong hand of the daimyōs\r\npreserved for their people the opportunities of life, and kept alive the\r\nchances of industry.(138)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. FROM THE ASHIKAGA SHŌGUNS TO THE DEATH OF NOBUNAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn almost the worst period of the Ashikaga anarchy, A.D. 1542, the\r\nPortuguese made their first appearance in Japan. Galvano, who had been\r\ngovernor of the Moluccas, gives an account of this first visit, when three\r\nfugitives from a Portuguese vessel in a Chinese junk were driven upon the\r\nislands of southern Japan. Concerning the doings(139) of these fugitives\r\nwe have no account in any foreign narratives.\r\n\r\nBut Fernam Mendez Pinto,(140) in his travels, etc., gives a detailed\r\nnarrative of the visit which he and his companions made a few years later\r\nin a ship with a Chinese captain and merchandise. The exact year cannot be\r\nascertained from Pinto’s narrative, but Hildreth(141) assumes that it\r\ncould not have been earlier than A.D. 1545. Pinto landed on Tane-ga-shima,\r\nan island south of the extreme southern point of the island of Kyūshū.\r\nThey were received with great cordiality by the prince, who evinced the\r\nutmost curiosity concerning the Portuguese who were on this ship. Pinto\r\nnaïvely confesses that “we rendered him answers as might rather fit his\r\nhumor than agree with the truth, ... that so we might not derogate from\r\nthe great opinion he had conceived of our country.”(142)\r\n\r\nAs a return for some of the kindnesses which the prince showed them, the\r\nPortuguese gave him a _harquebuse_, and explained to him the method of\r\nmaking powder. The present seems to have been most acceptable, and Pinto\r\ndeclares the armorers commenced at once to make imitations of it, “so that\r\nbefore their departure (which was five months and a half after) there were\r\nsix hundred of them made in the country.” And a few years later he was\r\nassured that there were above thirty thousand in the city of Fucheo,(143)\r\nthe capital of Bungo, and above three hundred thousand in the whole\r\nprovince. And so they have increased from this one _harquebuse_ which they\r\ngave to the prince of Tane-ga-shima, until every hamlet and city in the\r\nempire in a short time were supplied with them.(144)\r\n\r\nA short time after their reception at Tane-ga-shima the Prince of Bungo,\r\nwho was a relative of the Prince of Tane-ga-shima, sent for one of the\r\nPortuguese, and Pinto, by his own consent, was selected as being of a\r\n“more lively humor.” He was received with great consideration, and proved\r\nhimself of vast service in curing the prince of gout, with which he was\r\naffected. His success in this cure gave him immense repute, and he was\r\ninitiated into all the gayeties and sports of the prince’s court. In\r\nparticular he amused and interested them all by firing the matchlock which\r\nhe had brought with him. A son of the prince of about sixteen or seventeen\r\nyears of age was infatuated with this sport, and one day, unknown to\r\nPinto, he undertook to load and fire the matchlock, as he had seen the\r\nforeigner do. An explosion occurred, by which the young prince was much\r\ninjured, and owing to this Pinto came near being put to death for having\r\nwrought this disaster. But the young prince had more sense than the\r\nattendants, and at his request Pinto was given a chance to bind up the\r\nwounds and take care of him. The result was that the young prince quickly\r\nrecovered, and the fame of this cure was spread everywhere. “So that,”\r\nsays Pinto, “after this sort I received in recompense of this my cure\r\nabove fifteen hundred ducats that I carried with me from this place.”\r\n\r\nPinto made a second visit to Japan in the interests of trade in 1547,\r\nwhich was attended by a circumstance which had far-reaching results. In\r\ncritical circumstances they were called upon to take off two fugitives who\r\nappealed to them from the shore. A company of men on horseback demanded\r\nthe return of the fugitives, but without answer they pulled off to the\r\nship and took them aboard. The principal of these two fugitives(145) was\r\nAnjiro, whom the Jesuits usually name Anger, and his companion was his\r\nservant. They were taken in the Portuguese vessel to Malacca, where Pinto\r\nmet Father Francis Xavier, who had just arrived upon his mission to the\r\nEast. Xavier became intensely interested in these Japanese fugitives, and\r\ntook them to Goa, then the principal seat of Jesuit learning and the seat\r\nof an archbishopric in the East Indies. Here both the Japanese became\r\nconverts and were baptized, Anjiro receiving the name of Paulo de Santa\r\nFé(146) (Paul of the Holy Faith), and his companion the name of John. They\r\nlearned to speak and write the Portuguese language, and were instructed in\r\nthe elements of the Christian religion. With these efficient helps Xavier\r\nwas ready to enter Japan and commence the evangelization on which his\r\nheart had long been set.\r\n\r\nAt last arrangements were made with a Chinese vessel, which according to\r\nPinto’s account was a piratical craft, to convey Xavier and his companions\r\nto Japan. They arrived at Kagoshima, the capital of the province of\r\nSatsuma, August 15, A.D. 1549. Besides Xavier and his Japanese companions\r\nthere were Cosme de Torres, a priest, and Jean Ferdinand, a brother of the\r\nSociety of Jesus. They were cordially received by the Prince of Satsuma,\r\nand after a little, permission was given them to preach the Christian\r\nreligion in the city of Kagoshima. The family and relatives of Anjiro, who\r\nlived in Kagoshima, were converted and became the first fruits of the\r\nmission. In the letters which Xavier wrote home about this time we have\r\nhis early impressions concerning the Japanese. The princess took great\r\ninterest in the subjects discussed by Anjiro, and was especially struck\r\nwith a picture of the Madonna and child which he showed her. She asked to\r\nhave the heads of the Christian faith put in writing in order that she\r\nmight study them. For this reason a creed and a catechism were prepared\r\nand translated into the Japanese language, for the use of the princess and\r\nother enquirers. In one of his early letters he says: “I really think that\r\namong barbarous nations there can be none that has more natural goodness\r\nthan Japan.”(147) In the same letter he says: “They are wonderfully\r\ninclined to see all that is good and honest and have an eagerness to\r\nlearn.” Xavier, in letter 79, narrates his meeting with the Buddhist\r\npriest whom he calls Ningh-Sit, which name he says means Heart of Truth.\r\nThis priest was eighty years old, and in the conversation expressed great\r\nsurprise that Xavier should have come all the way from Portugal to preach\r\nto the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe biographers of Xavier have given us the fullest details of his life\r\nand works. That he was a man of the most fervent piety as well as the most\r\nconspicuous ability, is apparent from the energy and success with which he\r\nconducted his short but brilliant mission. Both in their accounts of him,\r\nas well as in the papal bull announcing his canonization, the claim is\r\ndistinctly set forth of his possession of miraculous power. He is\r\nrepresented as having raised a Japanese girl from the dead; as possessing\r\nthe gift of tongues, that is, as being able to speak in fluent Japanese,\r\nalthough he had not learned the language; as having given an answer which\r\nwhen heard was a satisfactory reply to the most various and different\r\nquestions,(148) such as, “the immortality of the soul, the motions of the\r\nheavens, the eclipses of the sun and moon, the colors of the rainbow, sin\r\nand grace, heaven and hell.”\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           St. Francis Xavier.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet it must be stated that Xavier himself does not claim these miraculous\r\npowers. Indeed among the letters published by Father Horace Tursellini is\r\none in which he thus speaks of himself: “God grant that as soon as\r\npossible we may learn the language of Japan in order to make known the\r\ndivine mysteries; then we shall zealously prosecute our Christian work.\r\nFor they speak and discourse much about us, but we are silent, ignorant of\r\nthe language of the country. At present we are become a child again to\r\nlearn the elements of the language.”\r\n\r\nThe desire for trade with the Portuguese seems to have been a principal\r\nreason for the ready reception of the missionaries. And when the\r\nPortuguese merchant ships resorted to Hirado, an island off the west coast\r\nof Kyūshū, instead of the less accessible Kagoshima, the Prince of\r\nKagoshima turned against the missionaries and forbade them from preaching\r\nand proselyting. From Kagoshima Xavier went to Hirado, where he was\r\nreceived with a salvo of artillery from a Portuguese vessel then at anchor\r\nthere. Here he made a short stay, preaching the gospel as usual and with\r\nthe approval of the prince establishing a church. Leaving Kosmé de Torres\r\nat Hirado and taking with him Fernandez and the two Japanese assistants he\r\ntouched at Hakata, famous as the place where the Mongol invaders were\r\nrepulsed. Then he crossed over to the Main island and travelling by land\r\nalong the Sanyōdō he entered Yamaguchi in the province of Nagato. His\r\nhumble and forlorn appearance did not produce a favorable impression on\r\nthe people of this city and he was driven out with obloquy. He set out for\r\nKyōto with a party of Japanese merchants, and as it was winter and Xavier\r\nhad to carry; on his back a box containing the vestments and vessels for\r\nthe celebration of mass, the journey was trying and difficult. He arrived\r\nat Kyōto A.D. 1550 in the midst of great political troubles. A fire had\r\ndestroyed a great part of what had been once a beautiful and luxurious\r\ncity. Many of the principal citizens had abandoned it and taken up their\r\nresidence with local princes in the provinces. Xavier could obtain a\r\nhearing neither from the emperor nor from the Ashikaga shōguns, who\r\nmaintained a representative in the capital at this time. He preached in\r\nthe street as he could obtain opportunity. But the atmosphere was\r\neverywhere unfavorable, and he resolved to abandon the field for the\r\npresent. Accordingly he went back to Bungo, whence he sailed for China\r\nNovember 20, A.D. 1551, with the purpose of establishing a mission. He had\r\nspent two years and three months in Japan and left an impression which has\r\nnever been effaced. He died on his way, at the little island of Sancian,\r\nDecember 2, A.D. 1552, aged forty-six. His body was carried to Malacca and\r\nafterward to Goa, where it was buried in the archiepiscopal\r\ncathedral.(149)\r\n\r\nThe departure and death of Xavier did not interrupt the work of the\r\nmission in Japan. Kosmé de Torres was left in charge and additional\r\nhelpers, both priests and lay brothers, were sent to prosecute what had\r\nbeen so conspicuously begun. The political disturbances in Yamaguchi for a\r\ntime interfered with the labors of the missionaries there. Bungo was the\r\nprincipal province where their encouragement had made their success most\r\nconspicuous. The prince had not indeed been baptized but he had permitted\r\nthe fathers to preach and he had allowed converts to adopt the new\r\nreligion, so that the work had assumed a promising appearance. The Prince\r\nof Ōmura became a convert and by his zeal in the destruction of idols and\r\nother extreme measures aroused the hostility of the Buddhist priesthood.\r\nIn Kyōto the progress of the work encountered many vicissitudes. The\r\npolitical troubles arising out of the contests between Mōri of Chōshū and\r\nthe rival house interfered with the propagation of Christianity both in\r\nYamaguchi and Kyōto. Mōri himself, the most powerful prince of his time\r\nand who once held the control in ten provinces, was hostile to the\r\nChristians. By his influence the work in Kyōto was temporarily abandoned\r\nand the fathers resorted to Sakai, a seaport town not far from Ōsaka,\r\nwhere a branch mission was established.\r\n\r\nIt was in A.D. 1573 that Nagasaki became distinctively a Christian city.\r\nAt that time the Portuguese were seeking various ports in which they could\r\nconduct a profitable trade, and they found that Nagasaki possessed a\r\nharbor in which their largest ships could ride at anchor. The merchants\r\nand Portuguese fathers therefore proposed to the Prince of Ōmura, in whose\r\nterritory the port of Nagasaki was situated, to grant to them the town\r\nwith jurisdiction over it. The prince at first refused, but finally by the\r\nintervention of the Prince of Arima the arrangement was made.(150) The\r\ntransference to Nagasaki of the foreign trade at this early day made it a\r\nvery prosperous place. The Prince of Ōmura had the town laid out in\r\nappropriate streets, and Christian churches were built often on the sites\r\nof Buddhist temples which were torn down to give place for them. It is\r\nsaid that in A.D. 1567 “there was hardly a person who was not a\r\nChristian.”\r\n\r\nWe shall have occasion often in the subsequent narrative to refer to the\r\nprogress of Christianity in the empire. In the meantime we must trace the\r\ncareer of Nobunaga, who exerted a powerful effect on the affairs of his\r\ncountry and particularly upon the condition of both Buddhism and\r\nChristianity. He must be regarded always as one of the great men of Japan\r\nwho at an opportune moment intervened to rescue its affairs from anarchy.\r\nHe prepared the way for Hideyoshi and he, in turn, made it possible for\r\nIeyasu to establish a peace which lasted without serious interruption for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nOta Nobunaga was descended from the Taira family through Ota Chikazane, a\r\ngreat-grandson of Taira Kiyomori. The father of Chikazane had perished in\r\nthe wars between the Taira and Minamoto families, and his mother had\r\nmarried as her second husband the chief man in the village of Tsuda in the\r\nprovince of Ōmi. The step-child was adopted by a Shintō priest of the\r\nvillage of Ota in the province of Echizen, and received the name of Ota\r\nChikazane. When he grew up, he became a Shintō priest and married and\r\nbecame the father of a line of priests. One of this succession was Ota\r\nNobuhide, who seems to have reverted from the priestly character back to\r\nthe warlike habits of his ancestors. In the general scramble for land,\r\nwhich characterized that period, Nobuhide acquired by force of arms\r\nconsiderable possessions in the province of Owari, which at his death in\r\nA.D. 1549 he left to his son Ota Nobunaga. This son grew up to be a man of\r\nlarge stature, but slender and delicate in frame. He was brave beyond the\r\nusual reckless bravery of his countrymen. He was by character and training\r\nfitted for command, and in the multifarious career of his busy life, in\r\nexpeditions, battles, and sieges, he showed himself the consummate\r\ngeneral. Like many other men of genius he was not equally as skilful in\r\ncivil as military affairs. He was ambitious to reduce the disorders of his\r\ncountry, and he was able to see in a great measure the success of his\r\nschemes. But he failed in leaving when he died any security for the\r\npreservation and continuance of that peace and unity which he had\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\nAt the time Nobunaga became prominent, the Emperor Go-Nara had died and\r\nŌgimachi in A.D. 1560 had just succeeded to the throne as the one hundred\r\nand fifth emperor. Ashikaga Yoshifusa had become shōgun in A.D. 1547 as a\r\nboy eleven years old, and was at this time a young man, who as usual\r\ndevoted himself to pleasure while the affairs of government were conducted\r\nby others. Both emperor and shōgun were almost powerless in the empire,\r\nthe real power being held by the local princes. In many cases they had\r\nlargely increased their holdings by conquest, and were almost entirely\r\nindependent of the central authority. For more than a century this\r\nindependence had been growing, and at the time of Nobunaga there was\r\nlittle pretence of deferring to the shōgun in any matter growing out of\r\nthe relations of one prince to the other, and none at all in reference to\r\nthe internal government of the territories within their jurisdiction. The\r\nprincipal local rulers at this time were the following: Imagaya Yoshimoto\r\ncontrolled the three provinces of Suruga, Tōtōmi, and Mikawa; Hōjō Ujiyasu\r\nfrom the town of Odowara ruled the Kwanto, including the provinces of\r\nSagami, Musashi, Awa, Kazusa, Shimosa, Hitachi, Kōtsuke, and Shimotsuke;\r\nTakeda Shingen ruled the province of Kai and the greater part of the\r\nmountainous province of Shinano; Uesugi Kenshin held under his control the\r\nnorthwestern provinces of Echizen, Echigo, Etchū, and Noto; Mōri Motonari\r\nafter a severe contest had obtained control of almost all the sixteen\r\nprovinces which composed the Chūgoku or central country; the island of\r\nKyūshū had been the scene of frequent civil wars and was now divided\r\nbetween the houses of Shimazu of Satsuma, Ōtomo of Bungo, and Ryōzoji of\r\nHizen; and finally the island of Shikoku was under the control of\r\nChōsokabe Motochika.(151) Besides these principal rulers, there were many\r\nsmaller holders who occupied fiefs subordinate to the great lords, and\r\npaid for their protection and their suzerainty in tribute and military\r\nservice. In the letters of the Jesuit missionaries of this period the\r\ngreat lords are denominated _kings_, but neither according to the theory\r\nof the Japanese government, nor the actual condition of these rulers can\r\nthe name be considered appropriate. The term daimyō(152) came into its\r\nfull and modern use only when Ieyasu reorganized and consolidated the\r\nfeudal system of the empire. But even at the period of Nobunaga the name\r\nwas employed to indicate the owners of land. We prefer to continue down to\r\nthe time of the Tokugawa shōguns the use of the terms _prince_ and\r\n_principality_ for the semi-independent rulers and their territories.\r\n\r\nThe holdings which Ota Nobunaga inherited from his father consisted only\r\nof four small properties in the province of Owari. Acting according to the\r\nfashion of the times he gradually extended his authority, until by A.D.\r\n1559 we find him supreme in Owari with his chief castle at Kiyosu near to\r\nthe city of Nagoya. His leading retainers and generals were Shibata\r\nGenroku and Sakuma Yemon, to whom must be added Hideyoshi,(153) who\r\ngradually and rapidly rose from obscurity to be the main reliance of his\r\nprince. Nobunaga was a skilful general, and whenever an interval occurred\r\nin his expeditions against his hostile neighbors he employed the time in\r\ncarefully drilling his troops, and preparing them for their next\r\nmovements. He found in Hideyoshi an incomparable strategist, whose plans,\r\nartifices, and intrigues were original and effective, and were worth more\r\nto his master than thousands of troops.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult in those days to find excuses to invade neighboring\r\ndomains, and hence we find Nobunaga, as soon as he had made himself master\r\nof Owari, on one pretext or another making himself also master of the\r\nprovinces of Mino, Ōmi, and Isé. Before this was accomplished, however, we\r\nsee plain indications both on the part of Nobunaga and his retainers that\r\nthe ultimate aim in view was the subjugation of the whole country, and the\r\nestablishment of a government like that of Yoritomo.\r\n\r\nAt this time (A.D. 1567) the affairs of the Ashikaga shōguns, who ruled in\r\nthe name of the emperor, were in a state of great confusion. Yoshiteru,\r\nthe shōgun, had been assassinated by one of his retainers, Miyoshi\r\nYoshitsugu. The younger brother of Yoshiteru was Yoshiaki, who desired to\r\nsucceed, but this did not comport with the designs of the assassins.\r\nAccordingly after making several unsuccessful applications for military\r\naid he finally applied to Nobunaga. This was exactly the kind of alliance\r\nthat Nobunaga wanted to justify his schemes of national conquest. With his\r\nown candidate in the office of shōgun, he could proceed without impediment\r\nto reduce all the princes of the empire to his supreme authority. He\r\ntherefore undertook to see Yoshiaki established as shōgun, and for this\r\npurpose marched a large army into Kyōto. Yoshiaki was installed as shōgun\r\nin A.D. 1568, and at his suggestion the emperor conferred on Nobunaga the\r\ntitle of Fuku-shōgun(154) or vice-shōgun. This was Nobunaga’s first\r\ndealings with the imperial capital, and the presence of his large army\r\ncreated a panic among the inactive and peaceful citizens.\r\n\r\nHe appointed Hideyoshi as commander-in-chief of the army at the capital,\r\nwho with a sagacity and energy that belonged to his character set himself\r\nto inspire confidence and to overcome the prejudice which everywhere\r\nprevailed against the new order of things. Kyōto had suffered so much from\r\nfires and warlike attacks, and still more by poverty and neglect, that it\r\nwas now in a lamentable condition. To have somebody, therefore, with the\r\npower and spirit to accomplish his ends, undertake to repair some of the\r\nwastes, and put in order what had long run to ruin, was an unexpected and\r\nagreeable surprise. The palaces of the emperor and the shōgun were\r\nrepaired and made suitable as habitations for the heads of the nation.\r\nStreets and bridges, temples and grounds were everywhere put in order.\r\nKyōto for the first time in many centuries had the benefit of a good and\r\nstrong government.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom to celebrate the establishment of a new year-period with\r\npopular rejoicings. The period called Genki was begun in December A.D.\r\n1570 by the Emperor Ōgimachi. Nobunaga brought to Kyōto on this occasion a\r\nvery large army in order to impress on the minds of the nation his\r\noverwhelming military power. He intended, moreover, to march his forces,\r\nas soon as this celebration was over, against Prince Asakura Yoshikage of\r\nthe province of Echizen, who had not yet submitted himself to Nobunaga’s\r\nauthority, and who had not given in his adhesion to the new shōgun. Taking\r\nwith him Hideyoshi and all the troops that could be spared from Kyōto,\r\nNobunaga marched north into the domains of Yoshikage. He was aided in his\r\nresistance by Asai Nagamasa, the governor of the castle of Itami in the\r\nprovince of Ōmi. An attempt had been made by Nobunaga to conciliate\r\nNagamasa by giving him his sister in marriage. But Nagamasa was still\r\ncool, and now at this critical time he turned to help Nobunaga’s enemy.\r\nThe unexpected combination came very near causing Nobunaga a disastrous\r\ndefeat. At an important battle which was fought in this short campaign, we\r\nsee together the three most noted men of their time, Nobunaga, Hideyoshi,\r\nand Ieyasu. The last of the three was only a few years younger than\r\nHideyoshi, and had already shown indications of the clear and steady\r\ncharacter of which he afterward gave such indubitable proof. The result\r\nwas the defeat of Nobunaga’s enemies and his victorious return to the\r\ncastle of Gifu in the province of Mino.\r\n\r\nBut his way was not yet quite free from obstacles. Asakura Yoshikage and\r\nAsai Nagamasa although defeated were not crushed, and made various efforts\r\nto regain the advantage over Nobunaga. The most noted of these was when\r\nNobunaga was absent from Kyōto with troops quelling a disturbance in\r\nŌsaka, Asakura and Asai took advantage of the opportunity and marched a\r\nstrong force upon the city. They had proceeded as far as Hiei-zan on the\r\nborders of Lake Biwa. This mountain was then occupied by an immense\r\nBuddhist monastery called Enriaku-ji from the year-period when it was\r\nestablished. It was said, that at this time there were as many as three\r\nthousand buildings belonging to the monastery. The monks of this\r\nestablishment were exceedingly independent, and were so numerous and\r\npowerful that they were able to exact whatever concessions they desired\r\nfrom the government at Kyōto, from which they were only a few miles\r\ndistant. They disliked Nobunaga and his powerful government with which\r\nthey dared not take their usual liberties. Accordingly they made common\r\ncause with Asakura and Asai and furnished them with shelter and supplies\r\non their march to Kyōto. But Nobunaga met them before they reached Kyōto,\r\nand so hemmed them in that they were glad to sue for peace and get back to\r\ntheir own provinces as well as they could. But on the ill-fated monastery\r\nNobunaga in A.D. 1571 visited a terrible revenge. He burned their\r\nbuildings, and what monks survived the slaughter he drove into banishment.\r\nThe monastery was partially restored subsequently by Ieyasu, but it was\r\nrestricted to one hundred and twenty-five buildings and never afterwards\r\nwas a political power in the country.\r\n\r\nDuring these years of Nobunaga’s supremacy, the Jesuit fathers had been\r\npushing forward their work of proselyting and had met with marvellous\r\nsuccess. The action of the Buddhist priests in siding with his enemies and\r\nthe consequent aversion with which he regarded them, led Nobunaga to favor\r\nthe establishment of Christian churches. In the letters of the fathers at\r\nthis period frequent references are made to Nobunaga and of his favorable\r\nattitude toward Christianity and their hope that he would finally become a\r\nconvert. But it is plain that the fathers did not comprehend fully the\r\ncause for the enmity of Nobunaga to the Buddhist monks, and his political\r\nreasons for showing favor to the Christian fathers. He remained as long as\r\nhe lived friendly to the Christian church, but made no progress towards an\r\navowal of his faith. Under his patronage a church was built in Kyōto, and\r\nanother at Azuchi on Lake Biwa, where he built for himself a beautiful\r\ncastle and residence. By this patronage and the zeal of the fathers the\r\nChristian church rose to its greatest prosperity(155) during the closing\r\nyears of Nobunaga’s life. In the year A.D. 1582 a mission was sent to the\r\npope, consisting of representatives from the Christian princes of Bungo,\r\nArima, and Ōmura. This mission consisted of two young Christian princes\r\nabout sixteen years of age, accompanied by two counsellors who were of\r\nmore mature years, and by Father Valignani, a Portuguese Jesuit, and by\r\nFather Diego de Mesquita as their preceptor and interpreter. They visited\r\nthe capitals of Portugal and Spain, which at this time were combined under\r\nthe crown of Philip II. of Spain, and were received at both with the most\r\nimpressive magnificence. They afterward visited Rome and were met by the\r\nbody-guard of the pope and escorted into the city by a long cavalcade of\r\nRoman nobles. They were lodged in the house of the Jesuits, whence they\r\nwere conducted by an immense procession to the Vatican. The Japanese\r\nambassadors rode in this procession on horseback dressed in their richest\r\nnative costume. They each presented to the pope the letter(156) which they\r\nhad brought from their prince, to which the reply of the pope was read.\r\nThe presents which they had brought were also delivered, and after a\r\nseries of most magnificent entertainments, and after they had been\r\ndecorated as Knights of the Gilded Spears, they took their departure. In\r\nthe meantime Pope Gregory XIII., who had received them, a few days later\r\nsuddenly died A.D. 1585. His successor was Pope Sixtus V., who was equally\r\nattentive to the ambassadors, and who dismissed them with briefs addressed\r\nto their several princes.\r\n\r\nShōgun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, whom Nobunaga had been instrumental in\r\ninstalling, became restive in the subordinate part which he was permitted\r\nto play. He sought out the princes who still resisted Nobunaga’s supremacy\r\nand communicated with them in reference to combining against him. He even\r\nwent so far as to fortify some of the castles near Kyōto. Nobunaga took\r\nstrenuous measures against Yoshiaki, and in A.D. 1573 deposed him. He was\r\nthe last of the Ashikaga shōguns, and with him came to an end a dynasty\r\nwhich had continued from Taka-uji in A.D. 1335 for two hundred and\r\nthirty-eight years.\r\n\r\nNobunaga assumed the duties which had hitherto been performed by the\r\nshōgun, that is he issued orders and made war and formed alliances in the\r\nname of the emperor. But he never took the name of shōgun(157) or presumed\r\nto act in a capacity which from the time of Yoritomo had always been\r\nfilled by a member of the Minamoto family, while he was a member of the\r\nTaira family. Whether this was the cause of his unwillingness to call\r\nhimself by this title to which he might legitimately have aspired we can\r\nonly conjecture. Of one thing we may be sure, that he was disinclined to\r\narouse the enmity of the ambitious princes of the empire, whose\r\nco-operation he still needed to establish his power on an enduring basis,\r\nby assuming a position which centuries of usage had appropriated to\r\nanother family. The emperor bestowed upon him the title of _nai-daijin_,\r\nwhich at this time however was a purely honorary designation and carried\r\nno power with it.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Chōsū was one of the most powerful of those who had not yet\r\nsubmitted to the supremacy of Nobunaga. The present prince was Mōri\r\nTerumoto, the grandson of the Mōri Motonari who by conquest had made\r\nhimself master of a large part of the central provinces. Nobunaga\r\ndespatched Hideyoshi with the best equipped army that at that time had\r\never been fitted out in Japan, to subdue the provinces lying to the west\r\nof Kyōto. He did not overrate the ability of the general to whom he\r\nentrusted this task. They set out in the early part of the year A.D. 1578.\r\nTheir first movement was against the strongholds of the province of\r\nHarima, which he reduced. We for the first time find mention in this\r\ncampaign of Kuroda(158) Yoshitaka, who in the invasion of Korea was a\r\nnotable figure. His services to Hideyoshi at this time were most signal.\r\nThe campaign lasted about five years and added five provinces to\r\nNobunaga’s dominions. Then after a visit to Kyōto he continued his\r\nconquests, never meeting with a defeat. The most remarkable achievement\r\nwas the capture of the castle of Takamatsu, in the province of Sanuki.\r\nThis castle was built with one side protected by the Kōbe-gawa and two\r\nlakes lying on the other sides, so that it was impossible to approach it\r\nby land with a large force. Hideyoshi, with the genius for strategy which\r\nmarked his character, saw that the only way to capture the fort was to\r\ndrown it out with water. He then set his troops to dam up the river below\r\nthe fortress. Gradually this was accomplished and as the water rose the\r\noccupants of the castle became more uncomfortable. Hideyoshi understanding\r\nhis master’s character feared to accomplish this important and critical\r\nexploit without Nobunaga’s knowledge. He therefore wrote asking him to\r\ncome without delay to his assistance. Nobunaga set out with a group of\r\ngenerals, among whom was Akechi Mitsuhide, with the troops under their\r\ncommand. They started from Azuchi on Lake Biwa, which was occupied as\r\nNobunaga’s headquarters. They were to proceed to the besieged fort by the\r\nshortest route. Nobunaga with a small escort went by way of Kyōto,\r\nexpecting soon to follow them. He took up his temporary abode in the\r\ntemple of Honnōji. It was observed that Akechi with his troops took a\r\ndifferent route from the others and marched towards Kyōto. When spoken to\r\nabout his purpose he exclaimed, “My enemy is in the Honnōji.” He explained\r\nto his captains his purpose and promised them unlimited plunder if they\r\nassisted him. He led his troops to Kyōto and directly to the Honnōji.\r\nNobunaga hearing the noise looked out and at once saw who were the\r\ntraitors. He defended himself for a time, but soon saw that he was\r\nhopelessly surrounded and cut off from help. He retired to an inner room\r\nof the temple, set it on fire, and then calmly committed _hara-kiri_. His\r\nbody was buried in the burning and falling ruins. His death occurred in\r\nA.D. 1582.\r\n\r\nThus ended the career of one of Japan’s great men. He had shown the\r\npossibility of uniting the provinces of Japan under one strong government.\r\nHe had given to Kyōto and the provinces lying east and north of it a\r\nperiod of peace and quiet under which great progress had been made in\r\nagriculture, the arts and in literature. He was a warrior and not a\r\nstatesman, and for this reason less was done than might have been in\r\nconfirming and solidifying the reforms which his conquest had made\r\npossible. Personally he was quick-tempered and overbearing, and often gave\r\noffence to those who were not able to see through his rough exterior to\r\nthe true and generous heart which lay beneath. The cause of the plot\r\nagainst him was probably the consequence of a familiarity with which he\r\nsometimes treated his military subordinates. It is said that on one\r\noccasion in his palace when he had grown somewhat over-festive he took the\r\nhead of his general Akechi(159) under his arm and with his fan played a\r\ntune upon it, using it like a drum. Akechi was mortally offended and never\r\nforgave the humiliating joke. His treason, which resulted in Nobunaga’s\r\ndeath, was the final outcome of this bit of thoughtless horse-play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. TOYOTOMI HIDEYOSHI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Nobunaga in the forty-ninth year of his age left the country\r\nin a critical condition. Sakuma and Shibata had been his active retainers\r\nand generals for many years, and they had the most bitter and envious\r\nhatred toward Hideyoshi, whom they had seen advance steadily up to and\r\npast them in the march of military preferment. It was to Hideyoshi that\r\nthe country looked to take up the work which Nobunaga’s death had\r\ninterrupted. Akechi began to realize when too late that he must reckon\r\nwith him for his terrible crime. He appointed two of his lieutenants to\r\nassassinate Hideyoshi on his way back to the capital. He sent word to Mōri\r\nTerumoto, who was trying to raise the siege of the castle of Takamatsu,\r\nconcerning Nobunaga’s death, hoping that this tragedy would encourage\r\nTerumoto to complete his designs.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the news had reached Hideyoshi. Terumoto had heard of the\r\nstarting of Nobunaga with additional troops, and had determined to make\r\npeace with Hideyoshi. He had sent messengers with a proposition for peace.\r\nThe measures for taking the castle had succeeded and it was surrendered.\r\nIn this state of things Hideyoshi(160) pursued a course which was\r\ncharacteristic of him. He sent word to Terumoto that Nobunaga was now dead\r\nand that therefore his proposition for peace might, if he wished, be\r\nwithdrawn. You must decide, he said, whether you will make peace or not;\r\nit is immaterial whether I fight or conclude a treaty of peace. To such a\r\nmessage there could be only one answer. Peace was at once concluded and\r\nHideyoshi started for Kyōto to deal with the traitors.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to assassinate Hideyoshi on his journey came very near being\r\nsuccessful. He was in such eagerness to reach his destination that he\r\nhurried on without regard to his army which accompanied him. A small\r\nbody-guard kept up as well as they could with their impatient chief. At\r\nNishinomiya in this journey Hideyoshi, when in advance of his body-guard,\r\nwas attacked by a band of the assassins. His only way of escape was by a\r\nnarrow road between rice fields, leading to a small temple. When he had\r\ntraversed part of this lane he dismounted, turning his horse around along\r\nthe way he had come, and stabbed him in the hind leg. Mad with pain, he\r\ngalloped back with disastrous effect upon the band which was following\r\nhim. Meanwhile Hideyoshi hurried to the temple. Here the priests were all\r\nin a big common bath-tub, taking their bath. Hastily telling them who he\r\nwas, and begging their protection, he stripped off his clothes and plunged\r\nin among the naked priests. When the assassins arrived, they could find\r\nnothing but a bath-tub full of priests, whom they soon left in search of\r\nthe fugitive. As they disappeared, the anxious body-guard arrived, and\r\nwere astonished and amused to find their chief clad in the garb of a\r\npriest and refreshed after his hurried journey with a luxurious bath.(161)\r\n\r\nHideyoshi, as soon as he arrived at Kyōto, issued an invitation to all the\r\nprinces to join him in punishing those who had brought about the death of\r\nNobunaga. A battle was fought at Yodo, not far from Kyōto, which resulted\r\nin the complete defeat of Akechi. He escaped, however, from this battle,\r\nbut on his way to his own castle he was recognized by a peasant and\r\nwounded with a bamboo spear. Seeing now that all hope was gone, he\r\ncommitted _hara-kiri_, and thus ended his inglorious career. His head was\r\nexposed in front of Honnōji, the temple where Nobunaga perished.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, this premature death of Nobunaga—for he was\r\nonly forty-nine years old—created an intense excitement. The idea of\r\nheredity had so fixed a place in men’s minds, that the only thought of\r\nNobunaga’s friends and retainers was to put forward in his place some one\r\nwho should be his heir. There were living two sons, both by concubines,\r\nviz. Nobuo and Nobutaka, and a grandson, Sambōshi, still a child, who was\r\na son of his son Nobutada, now deceased. Each of these representatives had\r\nsupporters among the powerful retainers of the dead prince. It may be\r\nassumed that each was supported not because of the rightful claim which he\r\nhad to the estates and the power which the dead prince had left behind\r\nhim, but solely because the supporters of the successful heir would be\r\nentrusted with special authority, and endowed with conquered provinces. It\r\nis sufficient to explain here that Hideyoshi supported the candidacy of\r\nthe grandson, Sambōshi, probably with no higher motive nor more\r\ndisinterested purpose than the others. After a noisy and hot debate it was\r\nfinally agreed that the grandson should be installed as successor, and\r\nHideyoshi undertook to be his guardian. He had a large army at Kyōto, and\r\nwith this he felt strong enough to carry things with a high hand. He\r\nappointed a funeral ceremony to be held in honor of Nobunaga, to which all\r\nthe princes were invited, and he posted his troops in such a way as to\r\ncommand every avenue of approach. He claimed for himself, as guardian of\r\nthe child Sambōshi, precedence of all the princes and generals. So at the\r\nfuneral service, with the child Sambōshi in his arms, he proceeded in\r\nadvance of all others to pay memorial honors to the dead. He supported\r\nthis action with such an overwhelming display of military force that his\r\nenemies were afraid to show any resistance.\r\n\r\nThe disappointed princes retired to their provinces and hoped that by some\r\nfortuitous circumstances they might still be able to circumvent the plans\r\nof Hideyoshi. He saw well that he must meet the opposition which would be\r\nconcentrated on him by activity and force. As a general not one of his\r\nenemies could compare with him in fertility of resources, in decisiveness\r\nof action, and in command of military strength. His first contest was with\r\nhis old comrade in arms Shibata Katsuie, who had served with him under\r\nNobunaga, and who was intensely jealous of Hideyoshi’s rapid rise in\r\nmilitary rank and territorial authority. Shibata had championed the cause\r\nof Nobutaka in the contest as to the successor of Nobunaga. He had command\r\nof troops in Echizen, and Nobutaka was governor of the castle of Gifu in\r\nthe province of Mino. The campaign was a short and decisive one. The\r\nbattle was fought at Shigutake and resulted in the complete defeat of\r\nShibata and his allies. It is notable that in this battle artillery were\r\nused and played a conspicuous part. Shibata after his overthrow committed\r\n_hara-kiri_. Nobutaka having escaped also put an end to himself. Thus the\r\nactive enemies of Hideyoshi in the north and west were overcome and the\r\nforfeited territory made use of to reward his friends.\r\n\r\nHis next contest was with the adherents of Nobuo, the other son of\r\nNobunaga. This was made memorable by the assistance which Ieyasu rendered\r\nto Nobuo. Hideyoshi’s army, himself not being present, was defeated.\r\nIeyasu being satisfied with this victory and knowing that he could not\r\nultimately triumph now made peace with Hideyoshi. The island of Shikoku,\r\nwhich was under the control of Chōsokabe Motochika was reduced to\r\nsubjection in a brief campaign and the chiefs compelled to do duty to\r\nHideyoshi as their head.\r\n\r\nIt seems that at this time Hideyoshi was ambitious to attain official\r\nappointment which would legitimately descend to his children and make him\r\nthe founder of a new line of shōguns. He applied to the ex-shōgun\r\nYoshiaki, whom Nobunaga had deposed(162) and who was now living in\r\nretirement, intimating that it would be to his interest to adopt him as\r\nhis son so that he could be appointed by the emperor as shōgun. But\r\nYoshiaki declined to comply with this suggestion on account of Hideyoshi’s\r\nhumble origin. In place of this appointment, however, he was installed\r\nA.D. 1585 by the Emperor Ōgimachi as _Kuambaku_, which is higher in rank\r\nthan any other office in the gift of the imperial court. Hitherto this\r\ntitle had been borne exclusively by members of the Fujiwara family, and it\r\nmust have been a severe blow to their aristocratic pride to have a humble\r\nplebeian who had risen solely by his own talents thus elevated by imperial\r\nappointment to this dignified position. He also received at this time the\r\nname of Toyotomi(163) by which he was afterward called, and in recognition\r\nof his successful conquest of much territory he received A.D. 1575 the\r\nhonorary title of Chikuzen-no-kami.\r\n\r\nThere were a few years from about A.D. 1583—with an important exception\r\nwhich will be given below—when peace reigned in all the territories of\r\nJapan, and when Hideyoshi devoted himself wisely and patiently to the\r\nsettlement of the feudal condition of the country. It was at this time he\r\nbegan building his great castle at Ōsaka which occupied about two years.\r\nWorkmen were drawn from almost all parts of Japan, and a portion of it is\r\nsaid to have been finer and more massive than had ever been seen in Japan.\r\nThis magnificent work(164) survived its capture by Ieyasu in 1614 and\r\nremained undisturbed down to the wars of the restoration in 1868, when it\r\nwas burned by the Tokugawa troops at the time they were about to evacuate\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe exception to which reference is made above was the important campaign\r\nwhich Hideyoshi was called upon to conduct in the island of Kyūshū against\r\nthe Satsuma clan.(165) The distance at which Kyūshū lay from the centre of\r\nimperial operations, the mountainous and inaccessible character of a great\r\npart of the territory, made it no easy matter to deal with the refractory\r\ninhabitants of this island. The Satsuma clan even at that early day had a\r\nreputation for bravery and dash which made them feared by all their\r\nneighbors. The prince of Satsuma at this time was Shimazu Yoshihisa, a\r\nmember of the same family who held the daimiate until the abolition of the\r\nfeudal system. It is a tradition that the first of this family was a son\r\nof Yoritomo, who in the year A.D. 1193 was appointed governor of Satsuma.\r\nLike all the feudal princes of the period, the prince of Satsuma was\r\nambitious to extend his dominion as far as possible. Hyūga, Bungo, Higo,\r\nand Hizen were either wholly or in part subject to his authority, so that\r\nby the year A.D. 1585 it was the boast of the prince that eight provinces\r\nacknowledged him as lord.(166)\r\n\r\nIt was in this critical period that Hideyoshi was appealed to for help by\r\nthe threatened provinces. He first sent a special envoy to Kagoshima, who\r\nwas directed to summon the prince to Kyōto to submit himself to the\r\nemperor and seek investiture from him for the territories which he held.\r\nShimazu received this message with scorn, tore up the letter and trampled\r\nit under his feet, and declared that to a man of mean extraction like\r\nHideyoshi he would never yield allegiance. Both parties recognized the\r\nnecessity of deciding this question by the arbitrament of war.\r\n\r\nHideyoshi called upon thirty-seven provinces to furnish troops for this\r\nexpedition. It is said that 150,000 men were assembled at Ōsaka ready to\r\nbe transported into Kyūshū. The vanguard, consisting of 60,000 men under\r\nHidenaga, the brother of Hideyoshi, set sail January 7, A.D. 1587. Troops\r\nfrom the western provinces joined these, so that this advanced army\r\nnumbered not less than 90,000 men.\r\n\r\nIn due time, January 22d, Hideyoshi himself, with his main army,\r\nconsisting of 130,000 men, left Ōsaka, marching by land to Shimonoseki,\r\nand from this point crossing over to Kyūshū. The Satsuma armies were in\r\nall cases far outnumbered, and step by step were compelled to retreat upon\r\nKagoshima. Hideyoshi had by means of spies(167) acquired a complete\r\nknowledge of the difficult country through which his armies must march\r\nbefore reaching Kagoshima. After much fighting the Satsuma troops were at\r\nlast driven into the castle of Kagoshima, and it only remained for\r\nHideyoshi to capture this stronghold in order to end in the most brilliant\r\nmanner his undertaking.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that Hideyoshi made one of these surprising and\r\nclever movements which stamp him as a man of consummate genius. Instead of\r\ncapturing the fortress and dividing up the territory among his deserving\r\ngenerals, as was expected, he restored to the Shimazu family its original\r\nbuildings, viz., the provinces of Satsuma and Ōsumi and half the province\r\nof Hyūga, only imposing as a condition that the present reigning prince\r\nshould retire in favor of his son, and that he should hold his fief as a\r\ngrant from the emperor. Thus ended one of the most memorable of the\r\ncampaigns which Hideyoshi had up to this time undertaken, and with this\r\nalso closed a series of events which exerted a permanent influence on the\r\nhistory of Japan.\r\n\r\nIt will be desirable at this point to trace the incidents which had\r\ntranspired in connection with the Jesuit fathers. It will be remembered\r\nthat the work of the fathers(168) was much interfered with by the\r\npolitical troubles which preceded the advent of Nobunaga. Owing to their\r\ntaking sides with his enemies he was very much incensed against the\r\nBuddhist priests and visited his indignation upon them in a drastic\r\nmeasure.(169) His desire to humiliate the Buddhist priests probably led\r\nhim to assume a favorable attitude towards the Christian fathers. As long\r\ntherefore as Nobunaga lived, churches were protected and the work of\r\nproselyting went on. Even after the death of Nobunaga in A.D. 1582 nothing\r\noccurred for some time to interfere with the spread of Christianity.\r\nHideyoshi was too much occupied with political and military affairs to\r\ngive much attention to the circumstances concerning religion. Indeed the\r\nopinion of Mr. Dening(170) in his _Life of Hideyoshi_ is no doubt true,\r\nthat he was in no respect of a religious temperament. Even the\r\nsuperstitions of his own country were treated with scant courtesy by this\r\ngreat master of men.\r\n\r\nGregory XIII. seeing what progress the Jesuits were making, and realizing\r\nhow fatal to success any conflict between rival brotherhoods would be,\r\nissued a brief in A.D. 1585, that no religious teachers except Jesuits\r\nshould be allowed in Japan. This regulation was exceedingly distasteful to\r\nboth the Dominicans and the Franciscans, especially after the visit of the\r\nJapanese embassy to Lisbon, Madrid, and Rome had directed the attention of\r\nthe whole religious world to the triumphs which the Jesuits were making in\r\nJapan. Envy against the Portuguese merchants for their monopoly of the\r\nJapanese trade had also its place in stirring up the Spaniards at Manila\r\nto seek an entrance to the island empire. The opposition with which\r\nChristianity had met was represented as due to the character and behavior\r\nof the missioners. In view of these circumstances the Spanish governor of\r\nManila sent a letter to Hideyoshi, asking for permission to open trade\r\nwith some of the ports of Japan. Four Franciscans attached themselves to\r\nthe bearer of this letter and in this way were introduced into the\r\ninterior of Japan. Among the valuable presents sent to Hideyoshi by the\r\ngovernor of Manila was a fine Spanish horse(171) with all its equipments.\r\nThese Franciscans who came in this indirect way were permitted to\r\nestablish themselves in Kyōto and Nagasaki. They were at once met by the\r\nprotest of the Jesuits who urged that the brief of the pope excluded them.\r\nBut these wily Franciscans replied that they had entered Japan as\r\nambassadors and not as religious fathers, and that now when they were in\r\nJapan the brief of the pope did not require them to leave.\r\n\r\nA very bitter state of feeling from the first therefore manifested itself\r\nbetween the Jesuits and Franciscans. The latter claimed that the\r\nopposition they met with was due to the plots and intrigues of the\r\nJesuits, and they openly avowed that the Jesuit fathers through cowardice\r\nfailed to exert themselves in the fulfilment of their religious duties,\r\nand in a craven spirit submitted to restrictions on their liberty to\r\npreach. Hideyoshi’s suspicion was aroused against the foreigners about\r\nthis time, A.D. 1587, by the gossip of a Portuguese sea-captain which had\r\nbeen reported to him. This report represented the captain as saying: “The\r\nking, my master, begins by sending priests who win over the people; and\r\nwhen this is done he despatches his troops to join the native Christians,\r\nand the conquest is easy and complete.”(172) This plan seemed so exactly\r\nto agree with experiences in China, India, and the East Indies, that\r\nHideyoshi resolved to make it impossible in Japan. He therefore issued an\r\nedict in the year A.D. 1587 commanding all foreign religious teachers on\r\npain of death to depart from Japan in twenty days. This edict, however,\r\ngave leave to Portuguese merchants “to traffic and reside in our ports\r\ntill further order; but withal we do hereby strictly forbid them, on pain\r\nof having both their ships and merchandises confiscated, to bring over\r\nwith them any foreign religious.”(173)\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this edict, in A.D. 1593 six Franciscans and three\r\nJesuits were arrested in Ōsaka and Kyōto and taken to Nagasaki, and there\r\nburnt. This was the first case of the execution of Christians by the order\r\nof the government. To explain the transportation of these missionaries to\r\nNagasaki and their execution there, it should be stated that in A.D. 1586,\r\nat the close of the Satsuma campaign, Nagasaki had been taken from the\r\nprince of Ōmura and made a government city, to be controlled by a governor\r\nappointed immediately from Kyōto. Shortly after this, in A.D. 1590, on\r\naccount of its superior harbor, it was fixed upon as the only port at\r\nwhich foreign vessels would be admitted.\r\n\r\nThere was still one refractory element in his dominions which it was\r\nnecessary to deal with. Hōjō Ujimasa maintained a hostile attitude at\r\nOdawara. He was determined once for all to reduce this rebellious chief\r\nand the others who might be influenced by his example. It is unnecessary\r\nto give the details of this short but decisive undertaking. Only one\r\nincident deserves to be given as illustrative of the character of\r\nHideyoshi. In sending troops to the field of action it was necessary that\r\na large number of horses should cross the sea of Enshū,(174) which was\r\nusually very rough at that time of year. The boatmen, as is usual, were\r\nvery superstitious, and had a decided aversion to transporting the horses\r\nin their boats; averring that the god of the sea Ryūgū had a special\r\ndislike for horses. Hideyoshi sent for the boatmen and told them that he\r\nhad undertaken this expedition at the command of the emperor, and that the\r\ngod of the sea was too polite to interfere in anything pertaining to the\r\ntransportation of troops for such a purpose. He said however that he would\r\nmake it all right by writing a letter to Ryūgū, instructing him to insure\r\nthe safe passage of the ships. This was done, and a letter addressed “Mr.\r\nRyūgū” was thrown into the sea. The boatmen were satisfied, and the horses\r\nwere taken over without difficulty.(175)\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Odawara the whole of the Kwantō, comprising the provinces\r\nof Sagami, Musashi, Kōtsuke, Shimotsuke, Hitachi, Shimōsa, Kazusa, and Awa\r\ncame into the possession of Hideyoshi. During the progress of the siege,\r\nit is said that he and Ieyasu were standing in a watch tower which they\r\nhad built on the heights above the castle of Odawara. Hideyoshi pointed to\r\nthe great plain before them and said(176): “Before many days I will have\r\nconquered all this, and I propose to give it into your keeping.”\r\n\r\nIeyasu thanked him warmly and said: “That were indeed great luck.”\r\n\r\nHideyoshi added: “Wilt thou reside here at Odawara as the Hōjō have done\r\nup to this time?”\r\n\r\nIeyasu answered: “Aye, my lord, that I will.”\r\n\r\n“That will not do,” said Hideyoshi. “I see on the map that there is a\r\nplace called Yedo about twenty _ri_ eastward from us. It is a position far\r\nbetter than this, and that will be the place for thee to live.”\r\n\r\nIeyasu bowed low and replied: “I will with reverence obey your lordship’s\r\ndirections.”\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this conversation after the fall of Odawara, Ieyasu was\r\nendowed with the provinces of the Kwantō and took up his residence at\r\nYedo. This is the first important appearance of Yedo in the general\r\nhistory of Japan. It had however an earlier history, when in the fifteenth\r\ncentury it appears as a fishing village called _Ye-do_, that is _door of\r\nthe bay_. Near this fishing village Ōta Dōkwan, a feudal baron, built\r\nhimself in A.D. 1456 a castle. With the advent of Ieyasu, Yedo became a\r\nplace of first importance, a rank which it still holds. The object of\r\nHideyoshi in thus entrusting this great heritage to Ieyasu seems to have\r\nbeen to secure him by the chains of gratitude to himself and his family.\r\nAlready Ieyasu was connected by marriage with Hideyoshi, his wife being\r\nHideyoshi’s sister. By making him lord of an immense and powerful country\r\nhe hoped to secure him in perpetual loyalty to himself and his heirs.\r\n\r\nIn order that he might be free from the cares and responsibilities of the\r\ngovernment at home, Hideyoshi retired from the position of _kwambaku_ A.D.\r\n1591 and took the title of _Taikō_. By this title he came to be generally\r\nknown in Japanese history, Taikō Sama, or my lord Taikō, being the form by\r\nwhich he was commonly spoken of. His nephew and heir Hidetsugu was at this\r\ntime promoted to the title of _kwambaku_, and was ostensibly at the head\r\nof the government. The Jesuit fathers speak of him as mild and amiable,\r\nand as at one time a hopeful student of the Christian religion. They note\r\nhowever a strange characteristic in him, that he was fond of cruelty and\r\nthat when criminals were to be put to death he sought the privilege of\r\ncutting them into pieces and trying cruel experiments upon their suffering\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1592 Taikō Sama had by one of his wives a son, whom he named\r\nHideyori. Over this new-born heir, whom, however, many suspect of not\r\nbeing Taikō Sama’s son, he made great rejoicing throughout the empire. He\r\nrequired his nephew to adopt this new-born son as his heir, although he\r\nhad several sons of his own. The result of this action was a feeling of\r\nhostility between the uncle and nephew. Hidetsugu applied to Mōri, the\r\nchief of Chōsū, to aid him in the conflict with his uncle. But Mōri was\r\ntoo wary to enter upon such a contest with the veteran general. Instead of\r\nhelping Hidetsugu, he revealed to Taikō Sama the traitorous proposition of\r\nhis nephew. Hidetsugu was thereupon stripped of his office and sent as an\r\nexile to the monastery of Kōya-san in the province of Kii. A year later he\r\nwas commanded with his attendants to commit _hara-kiri_; and with an\r\nunusual exhibition of cruelty, his counsellors, wives, and children were\r\nlikewise put to death.\r\n\r\nHideyoshi had for a long time contemplated the invasion of Korea and\r\nultimately of China. In a conversation with Nobunaga when he was about to\r\nset out on his conquest of the western provinces he is represented as\r\nsaying(177): “I hope to bring the whole of Chūgoku into subjection to us.\r\nWhen that is accomplished I will go on to Kyūshū and take the whole of it.\r\nWhen Kyūshū is ours, if you will grant me the revenue of that island for\r\none year, I will prepare ships of war, and purchase provisions, and go\r\nover and take Korea. Korea I shall ask you to bestow on me as a reward for\r\nmy services, and to enable me to make still further conquests; for with\r\nKorean troops, aided by your illustrious influence, I intend to bring the\r\nwhole of China under my sway. When that is effected, the three countries\r\n[China, Korea, and Japan] will be one. I shall do it all as easily as a\r\nman rolls up a piece of matting and carries it under his arm.” He had\r\nalready carried out part of this plan; he had brought the whole of Chūgoku\r\nand of the island of Kyūshū under his rule. It remained for him to effect\r\nthe conquest of Korea and China in order to complete his ambitious\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose he needed ships on a large scale, for the transportation\r\nof troops and for keeping them supplied with necessary provisions. From\r\nthe foreign merchants, who traded at his ports, he hoped to obtain ships\r\nlarger and stronger than were built in his own dominions. It was a great\r\ndisappointment to him when he found this impossible, and that the\r\nmerchants, whom he had favored, were unwilling to put their ships at his\r\ndisposal. It is claimed by the Jesuit fathers that this disappointment was\r\nthe chief reason for the want of favor with which Hideyoshi regarded them\r\nduring the last years of his life. It is also advanced as one reason for\r\nhis entering on the invasion of Korea, that he might thus employ in\r\ndistant and dangerous expeditions some of the Christian princes whose\r\nfidelity to himself and loyalty to the emperor he thought he had reason to\r\ndoubt. He was ambitious, so they said, to rival in his own person the\r\nreputation of the Emperor Ōjin, who rose in popular estimation to the rank\r\nof Hachiman, the god of war, and who is worshipped in many temples,\r\nbecause, while he was still unborn, his mother led a hostile and\r\nsuccessful expedition into this same Korea.\r\n\r\nThe immediate pretext(178) for a war was the fact that for many years the\r\nembassies which it had been the custom to send from Korea to Japan with\r\ngifts and acknowledgments had been discontinued. In A.D. 1582 he sent an\r\nenvoy to remonstrate, who was unsuccessful. Subsequently he sent the\r\nprince of Tsushima, who had maintained at Fusan, a port of Korea, a\r\nstation for trade, to continue negotiations. After some delay and the\r\nconcession of important conditions the prince had the satisfaction, in\r\nA.D. 1590, of accompanying an embassy which the government of Korea sent\r\nto Hideyoshi. They arrived at Kyōto at the time when Hideyoshi was absent\r\non his campaign against Hōjō Ujimasa at Odawara. He allowed them to await\r\nhis return, and even when he had resumed his residence at the capital he\r\nshowed no eagerness to give them an audience. On the pretence that the\r\nhall of audience needed repairs, he kept them waiting many months before\r\nhe gave orders for their reception. It seemed that he was trying to\r\nhumiliate them in revenge for their dilatoriness in coming to him. It is\r\nnot impossible that he had already made up his mind to conduct an\r\nexpedition in any event into Korea and China, and the disrespect with\r\nwhich he treated the embassy was with the deliberate intention of widening\r\nthe breach already existing.\r\n\r\nMr. Aston has given us an account of the reception which was finally\r\naccorded to the ambassadors, drawn from Korean sources, and which shows\r\nthat they were entertained in a very unceremonious fashion. They were\r\nsurprised to find that in Japan this man whom they had been led to look\r\nupon as a sovereign was only a subject. They presented a letter from the\r\nking of Korea conveying his congratulations and enumerating the gifts(179)\r\nhe had sent. These enumerated gifts consisted of horses, falcons, saddles,\r\nharness, cloth of various kinds, skins, ginseng, etc. These were articles\r\nwhich the Japanese of an earlier age had prized very highly and for the\r\nmore artistic production of some of which the Koreans had rendered\r\nmaterial assistance. Hideyoshi suggested that the embassy should return to\r\ntheir own country at once without waiting for an answer to their letter.\r\nThis they were unwilling to do. So they waited at Sakai whence they were\r\nto sail, till the _kwambaku_ was pleased to send them a message for their\r\nking. It was so arrogant in tone that they had to beg for its modification\r\nseveral times before they dared to carry it home. The letter plainly\r\nannounced his intention to invade China and called upon the Koreans to aid\r\nhim in this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe ambassadors went home with the conviction that it was Hideyoshi’s\r\nintention to invade their country. At their instigation the government\r\nmade what preparations it could, by repairing fortresses, and collecting\r\ntroops, arms, and provisions. The country was a poor country, and had had\r\nthe good fortune or the misfortune to remain at peace for two hundred\r\nyears. The arts of war had been forgotten. They had no generals who could\r\ncope with the practised soldiers of Japan. Firearms which had been\r\nintroduced into the military equipments of Japanese armies were almost\r\nunknown in Korea. It is true that they had been taken under the protection\r\nof China and could call upon her for aid. But China was distant and slow,\r\nand Korea might be destroyed before her slumbering energies could be\r\naroused.\r\n\r\nThe preparations which Hideyoshi made, as was his custom, were thorough\r\nand extensive. Each prince in Kyūshū, as being nearest to the seat of war,\r\nwas required to furnish a quota of troops in proportion to his revenues.\r\nEach prince in Shikoku and in the Main island, in like manner, was to\r\nprovide troops proportionate to his revenue and his proximity to the seat\r\nof war. Princes whose territories bordered on the sea were to furnish\r\njunks and boats, and men to handle them. The force which was thus\r\nassembled at Nagoya, now called Karatsu, in Hizen was estimated at 300,000\r\nmen, of whom 130,000 were to be immediately despatched. Hideyoshi did not\r\npersonally lead this force. It was under the command of two generals who\r\nwere independent of each other, but were ordered to co-operate. One of\r\nthese generals was Konishi Yukinaga Settsu-no-kami, whom the Jesuit\r\nfathers refer to under the name of Don Austin. From an humble position in\r\nlife he had risen to high and responsible rank in the army. Under the\r\ninfluence of Takeyama, a Christian prince, whom the Jesuit fathers call\r\nJusto Ucondono, he had been converted to Christianity. Hideyoshi, as has\r\nbeen pointed out, was desirous of securing the help of the Christian\r\nprinces in Kyūshū, and therefore appointed a Christian as one of the\r\ngenerals-in-chief. Under him were sent the contingents from Bungo, Ōmura,\r\nArima, and other provinces where the Christian element was predominant.\r\nThis division of the invading army may therefore be looked upon as\r\nrepresenting the Christian population of the empire. The other\r\ngeneral-in-chief was Katō Kiyomasa,(180) who had been associated with\r\nHideyoshi ever since the times of Nobunaga. He was the son of a blacksmith\r\nand in A.D. 1563 he became one of Hideyoshi’s retainers. He was a man of\r\nunusual size and of great personal bravery. He commanded an army collected\r\nmainly from the northern and eastern provinces, which comprised the\r\nexperienced veterans of Hideyoshi’s earlier campaigns. He is usually\r\nspoken of as inimical to the Christians, but this enmity probably grew up\r\nalong with the ill-feeling between the two armies in Korea.\r\n\r\nKonishi’s division arrived in Korea April 13, A.D. 1592, and captured the\r\nsmall town of Fusan, which had been the port at which the Japanese had for\r\ngenerations maintained a trading post. After the arrival of Katō the two\r\ndivisions marched towards the capital, reducing without difficulty the\r\ncastles that lay in their way. The greatest terror prevailed among the\r\ninhabitants, and the court, with King Riyen at its head, resolved to flee\r\ninto the province bordering on China. The armies reached the capital and\r\nthen set out northward. The dissensions between the commanders had by this\r\ntime reached such a point that they determined to separate. Katō traversed\r\nthe northeastern provinces and in his course captured many Koreans of\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nKonishi marched to the north and found the king at Pingshang on the\r\nborders of the river Taitong-Kiang. Here he was joined by Kuroda Noritaka,\r\nwhom the Jesuit fathers named Condera(181) Combiendono, and by Yoshitoshi\r\nthe prince of Tsushima, who had marched with their forces by a different\r\nroute. An effort at negotiations at this point met with no success. The\r\nking continued his flight northward to Ichiu, a fortified town on the\r\nborders of China. After he left a sharp contest took place between the\r\nbesiegers and defenders, which resulted in the abandonment of the town and\r\nits capture by the Japanese. The stores of grain which had been collected\r\nby the Koreans were captured with the town.\r\n\r\nKonishi was anxious to conduct further military operations in connection\r\nwith the Japanese vessels which had been lying all this time at Fusan.\r\nDirections were accordingly sent to have the junks sent round to the\r\nwestern coast. The Koreans picked up courage to show fight with their\r\nvessels, which seemed to have been of a superior construction to those of\r\ntheir enemies. They allured the Japanese boats out to sea and then turned\r\nupon them suddenly and treated them so roughly that they were glad to get\r\nback to the protection of the harbor and to give up the purpose of\r\ncruising along the western coast. The result of this little success\r\nencouraged the Koreans so much that it may be said to have been a turning\r\npoint in the invasion.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the piteous appeals of the Koreans to China had produced\r\nsome effect. A small army of five thousand men, which was raised in the\r\nadjoining province of Laotung, was sent to their aid. This insufficient\r\nforce rashly undertook to attack the Japanese in Pingshang. But they led\r\nthe invaders into the town, and then so thoroughly routed them that the\r\nescaped remnants made their way back to Laotung. This experience led the\r\nChinese officials to see that if they wished to help the Koreans at all\r\nthey must despatch a stronger force. This they set to work at once to do.\r\nThey endeavored to gain some time by pretending to enter upon negotiations\r\nfor an armistice. During the autumn months of A.D. 1592 the Japanese\r\ntroops were almost idle. And they were very much taken by surprise when\r\nnear the end of the year the Chinese army, forty thousand strong, besides\r\nKoreans, made its appearance on the scene. The Japanese commander had no\r\ntime to call for help, and before he realized the imminency of the danger\r\nPingshang was attacked. Being far outnumbered Konishi deemed it prudent to\r\nmake his escape from the beleaguered town, and to save his army by a\r\nretreat, which was a painful and inglorious one.\r\n\r\nThe other division of the Japanese army under Katō, who had occupied the\r\nwest coast, found its position untenable with a superior Chinese army\r\nthreatening it. It also was compelled to retreat towards the south. But\r\nthe veteran army of Katō was not content to yield all that it had gained\r\nwithout a struggle. A bloody engagement followed near Pachiung, in which\r\nthe Chinese and Korean army suffered a significant defeat. The Chinese\r\narmy then retired to Pingshang, and Katō was not in a condition to follow\r\nit over the impassable winter roads and with deficient supplies. The\r\nJapanese troops had suffered an experience such as never befell them under\r\nthe redoubtable leadership of Hideyoshi. And the Chinese had had enough of\r\nthe terrible two-handed swords which the Japanese soldier could wield so\r\neffectively.(182)\r\n\r\nThe chief obstacle to peace was the mutual distrust with which each of the\r\nthree parties regarded the others. Korea hated the Japanese with a perfect\r\nand justifiable hatred; she also feared and despised the pompous and\r\npretentious pride of China. But in the negotiations which ensued the\r\ncountry which had suffered most had least to say. It remained for the two\r\ngreater powers to come to some agreement which should be satisfactory to\r\nthem; and whether Korea were satisfied or not was of secondary moment.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese envoy proceeded to Peking and is said to have negotiated\r\npeace on these conditions: That the emperor of China should grant to\r\nHideyoshi the honor of investiture, that the Japanese troops should all\r\nleave Korea, and that Japan should engage never to invade Korea again.\r\nThere was some jangling about the withdrawal of the Japanese soldiers but\r\nat last this matter was arranged.\r\n\r\nAn embassy was sent by the Chinese government to Japan to carry out the\r\nceremony of investiture. They arrived in the autumn of the year A.D. 1596.\r\nTaikō Sama made elaborate preparations for their reception. Some fears\r\nwere felt as to how Taikō Sama would regard this proposition of\r\ninvestiture when he came to understand it. The Buddhist priest, who was to\r\ntranslate the Chinese document into Japanese(183) for the benefit of Taikō\r\nSama, was urged to make some modification in the wording to conciliate his\r\nambition. But he was too honest to depart from the true rendering. He read\r\nto Taikō Sama and the assembled court a letter from the Chinese emperor\r\ngranting him investiture as king of Japan, and announced having sent by\r\nthe ambassadors the robe and the golden seal pertaining to the office.\r\n\r\nTaikō Sama listened with amazement,(184) as he for the first time realized\r\nthat the Emperor of China by this document had undertaken to invest him as\r\nking of Japan instead of (“Ming emperor”). He was in an uncontrollable\r\nrage. He tore off the robe which he had put on. He snatched the document\r\nfrom the reader and tore it into shreds, exclaiming: “Since I have the\r\nwhole of this country in my grasp, did I wish to become its emperor I\r\ncould do so without the consent of the barbarians.” He was with difficulty\r\nrestrained from taking the life of the Japanese ambassador who had\r\nnegotiated the treaty. He sent word to the Chinese envoys who had brought\r\nthe robe and seal to begone back to their country and to tell their\r\nemperor that he would send troops to slaughter them like cattle. Both\r\nKorea and China knew that a new invasion would surely result from this\r\ndisappointment. Katō and Konishi the Japanese generals in the previous\r\ncampaign and who had gone home during the interval were ordered back to\r\ntake command of the old troops and of fresh recruits which were to be\r\nsent. They busied themselves with repairing the fortifications which had\r\nbeen left in possession of the Japanese garrisons.\r\n\r\nThe disgraced and frightened Chinese ambassadors made their way back to\r\nPeking. They were ashamed to present themselves without showing something\r\nin return for the gifts they had carried to Taikō Sama. They purchased\r\nsome velvets and scarlet cloth, which they represented as the presents\r\nwhich had been sent. They pretended that Taikō Sama was much pleased with\r\nthe investiture, and that his invasion of Korea was due to the fact that\r\nthe Korean government had interfered to prevent the free and kindly\r\nintercourse between China and Japan. The cloth and velvet, however, were\r\nat once recognized as European productions and not derived from Japan. So\r\nthe ambassadors were charged with deceit and at last confessed.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese army was reinforced, it is said, with 130,000 fresh troops.\r\nSupplies, however, were difficult to obtain, and the movements were much\r\nhindered. A small Chinese army of 5,000 men arrived at the end of the year\r\nA.D. 1597 to aid the Koreans. An attack on the Japanese ships at Fusan was\r\nmade by the Korean navy, but it was without difficulty repelled and most\r\nof the attacking ships destroyed. After some material advantages, which,\r\nhowever, were not decisive, the Japanese troops were forced to return to\r\nFusan for the winter. The principal engagement was at Yöl-san, a strong\r\nposition, accessible both by sea and land. It was garrisoned by troops of\r\nKatō’s division, who were brave and determined. The army composed of\r\nChinese and Koreans, under the Chinese commander-in-chief Hsing-chieh,\r\nlaid siege to this fortress, and succeeded in cutting off all its\r\ncommunications. But Kuroda and Hachisuka came to Katō’s assistance, and\r\ncompelled the Chinese general to raise the siege and retreat to Söul, the\r\nKorean capital. It was in one of the battles fought during the summer of\r\nA.D. 1598, that 38,700 heads of Chinese and Korean soldiers are said to\r\nhave been taken. The heads were buried in a mound after the ears and noses\r\nhad been cut off. These grewsome relics of savage warfare were pickled in\r\ntubs and sent home to Kyōto, where they were deposited in a mound in the\r\ngrounds of the temple of Daibutsu, and over them a monument erected which\r\nis marked _mimi-zuka_ or ear-mound. There the mound and monument can be\r\nseen to this day.(185)\r\n\r\nThe death of Taikō Sama occurred on the day equivalent to the 18th of\r\nSeptember, A.D. 1598, and on his death-bed he seems to have been troubled\r\nwith the thought of the veteran warriors who were uselessly wearing out\r\ntheir lives in Korea. In his last moments he opened his eyes and exclaimed\r\nearnestly: “Let not the spirits of the hundred thousand troops I have sent\r\nto Korea become disembodied in a foreign land.”(186) Ieyasu, on whom\r\ndevolved the military responsibility after the Taikō’s death, and who had\r\nnever sympathized with his wishes and aims regarding Korea, did not delay\r\nthe complete withdrawal of the troops which still remained in Korea.\r\n\r\nThus ended a chapter in the history of Japan, on which her best friends\r\ncan look back with neither pride nor satisfaction. This war was begun\r\nwithout any sufficient provocation, and its results did nothing to advance\r\nthe glory of Japan or its soldiers. The great soldier who planned it and\r\npushed it on with relentless energy gained nothing from it except\r\nvexation. Much of the time during which the war lasted he sat in his\r\ntemporary palace at Nagoya in Hizen, waiting eagerly for news from his\r\narmies. Instead of tidings of victories and triumphs and rich conquests,\r\nhe was obliged too often to hear of the dissensions of his generals, the\r\nstarving and miseries of his soldiers, and the curses and hatred of a\r\nruined and unhappy country. All that he had to show for his expenditure of\r\nmen and money were several _saké_ tubs of pickled ears and noses with\r\nwhich to form a mound in the temple of Daibutsu, and the recollection of\r\nan investiture by the emperor of China, which could only bring to him pain\r\nand humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe only beneficial results to Japan that can be traced to all this was\r\nthe introduction into different provinces of some of the skilled artisans\r\nof Korea. The prince of Satsuma, Shimazu Yoshihiro, in A.D. 1598, brought\r\nhome with him when he returned from the Korean war seventeen families of\r\nKorean potters,(187) who were settled in his province. They have lived\r\nthere ever since, and in many ways still retain the marks of their\r\nnationality. It is to them that Satsuma _faïence_ owes its exquisite\r\nbeauty and its world-wide reputation.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                Hideyoshi.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Taikō realized that his recovery was impossible he tried to\r\narrange the affairs of the empire in such a way as to secure a\r\ncontinuation of the power in his son Hideyori, who was at that time only\r\nfive years old. For this purpose he appointed a council consisting of\r\nTokugawa Ieyasu, Maeda Toshi-ie, Mōri Terumoto, Ukita Hide-ei and Uesugi\r\nKagekatsu, of which Ieyasu was the president and chief. These were to\r\nconstitute a regency during his son’s minority. He also appointed a board\r\nof associates, who were called middle councillors, and a board of military\r\nofficers called _bugyo_. He called all these councillors and military\r\nofficers into his presence before he died, and made them swear allegiance\r\nto his successor Hideyori. There seems to have been among them a suspicion\r\nof the fidelity of Ieyasu, for the Taikō is represented as saying to two\r\nof his friends: “You need not be anxious about Ieyasu. He will not rebel\r\nagainst my house.(188) Cultivate friendship with him.” Thus in his\r\nsixty-second year died (September, 1598) the greatest soldier, if not the\r\ngreatest man, whom Japan has produced. That he rose from obscurity solely\r\nby his own talents, is a more conspicuous merit in Japan than in most\r\nother countries. Family and heredity have always counted for so much in\r\nthis land of the gods, that few instances have occurred in which men of\r\nhumble birth have risen to eminence. That one such in spite of his low\r\nbirth, in spite of personal infirmities, in spite of the opposition and\r\nenvy of contemporaries, had risen to so high a position in the empire, has\r\nbeen a source of pride and encouragement to thousands of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe Taikō was buried close to the Daibutsu temple, which he himself had\r\nbuilt to shelter the colossal figure of Buddha, constructed in imitation\r\nof the Daibutsu which Yoritomo had built at Kamakura. The figure was to be\r\none hundred and sixty feet in height, and the workmen had it nearly\r\nfinished when a terrible earthquake in A.D. 1596 shook down the building.\r\nIn the following year the temple was rebuilt, and the image was completed\r\nup to the neck. The workmen were preparing to cast the head, when a fire\r\nbroke out in the scaffolding and again destroyed the temple, and also the\r\nimage. It was one of the schemes of Ieyasu, so it is said, to induce the\r\nyoung Hideyori to exhaust his resources upon such expensive projects, and\r\nthus render him incapable of resisting any serious movement against\r\nhimself. He therefore suggested to the boy and his mother that this temple\r\nand image, which Hideyoshi had begun, should not fail of erection. They\r\ntherefore resumed the construction, and carried it on with great\r\nlavishness. It took until A.D. 1614 to complete the work, and when it was\r\nabout to be consecrated with imposing ceremonies, Ieyasu, who by this time\r\nwas supreme in the empire, suddenly forbade the progress of the ceremony.\r\nHe affected to be offended by the inscription which had been put on the\r\nbell,(189) but the real reason was probably his desire to find some\r\npretext by which he could put a quarrel upon the adherents of Hideyori.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE FOUNDING OF THE TOKUGAWA SHŌGUNATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong all the friends and retainers of Hideyoshi the most prominent and\r\nable was Tokugawa Ieyasu. He was six years younger than Hideyoshi, and\r\ntherefore in A.D. 1598, when the Taikō died, he was fifty-six years old.\r\nHe was born at the village of Matsudaira in the province of Mikawa A.D.\r\n1542. His family counted its descent from Minamoto Yoshi-ie, who in the\r\neleventh century had by his military prowess in the wars against the Ainos\r\nearned the heroic name of Hachiman-Tarō. Therefore he was, as custom and\r\ntradition now for a long time had required for those holding the office of\r\nshōgun, a descendant from the Minamoto family.(190) The name Tokugawa,\r\nwhich Ieyasu rendered famous, was derived from a village in the province\r\nof Shimotsuke, where his ancestors had lived. His first experiences in war\r\nwere under Nobunaga, side by side with Hideyoshi. He proved himself not\r\nonly a capable soldier, prudent and painstaking, but also a good\r\nadministrator in times of peace. Hideyoshi had such confidence in him, and\r\nso much doubt about the wisdom of requiring the guardians to wait until\r\nhis son, a mere child five years old, had grown up to years of\r\nresponsibility, that he is represented as having said to Ieyasu: “I\r\nforesee that there will be great wars after my decease; I know too that\r\nthere is no one but you who can keep the country quiet. I therefore\r\nbequeath the whole country to you, and trust you will expend all your\r\nstrength in governing it. My son Hideyori is still young. I beg you will\r\nlook after him. When he is grown up, I leave it to you to decide whether\r\nhe will be my successor or not.”(191)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Taikō was dead, and the attempt was made to set in motion\r\nthe machinery he had designed for governing the country, troubles began to\r\nmanifest themselves. The princes whom he had appointed as members of his\r\ngoverning boards, began immediately to quarrel among themselves. On Ieyasu\r\ndevolved the duty of regulating the affairs of the government. For this\r\npurpose he resided at Fushimi, which is a suburb of Kyōto. His most active\r\nopponent was Ishida Mitsunari, who had been appointed one of the five\r\n_bugyō_, or governors, under the Taikō’s arrangement. They grew jealous of\r\nIeyasu, because, under the existing order of things, the governors were of\r\nvery minor importance. Mitsunari had acquired his influence with the\r\nTaikō, not through military achievements, but by intrigue and flattery. He\r\nwas cordially detested by such disinterested friends as Katō Kiyomasa and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe ground on which the opposition to Ieyasu was based was that he was not\r\nfaithfully performing his duty, as he had promised to the dying Taikō,\r\ntowards his child and heir. It is not improbable that even at this early\r\nday it was seen that Ieyasu proposed to disregard the pretensions of the\r\nyouthful son of Hideyoshi, in the same way that he in his day had\r\ndisregarded the claims of the heir of Nobunaga. The rough and warlike\r\ntimes, and the restless and ambitious manners of the feudal lords of these\r\ntimes, made it impossible to entrust the country to the hands of a child.\r\n\r\nUnder this strained relation, the members of the regency divided into two\r\nparties. Speaking broadly, it was again a contest between the north and\r\nthe south of Japan. Ieyasu’s association had been from the beginning with\r\nthe Kwantō, and now more than ever his power was centred about Yedo.\r\nMitsunari on the contrary had leagued himself with the princes of Chōsū\r\nand Satsuma, and with others of minor importance, all more or less\r\nrepresentative of the southern half of the empire. The Christians chiefly\r\nsided with Hideyori and his adherents. Mitsunari himself was a Christian\r\nconvert, and the Jesuit fathers explain that his position and that of the\r\nother Christian leaders were due to their conscientious desire to fulfil\r\ntheir oath of fidelity to Hideyori. That Ieyasu should have been derelict\r\nin such a solemn duty was a sufficient cause for their opposition to him.\r\n\r\nEvents now rushed rapidly to a culmination. One of the most powerful of\r\nthe princes allied against Ieyasu was Uesugi Kagekatsu, the lord of Echigo\r\nand Aizu. He had retired to Aizu after having solemnly made a\r\ncovenant(192) with the others engaged in the plot to take measures against\r\nIeyasu. He was summoned to Kyōto to pay his respects to the emperor, but\r\non some trivial excuse he declined to come. Ieyasu now saw that nothing\r\nbut war would settle the disputes which had arisen. He repaired to Yedo\r\nand to Shimotsuké, and made preparations for the conflict which he saw\r\nimpending.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the members of the league were busy. Mitsunari sent an\r\nurgent circular to all the feudal princes, charging Ieyasu with certain\r\nmisdeeds and crimes, the chief of which was that instead of guarding the\r\ninheritance of the Taikō for his son, he was with the blackest guilt\r\nendeavoring to seize it for himself. A formidable army was gathered at\r\nŌsaka consisting of 128,000 men.(193) Made up as it was from different\r\nprovinces and officered by its provincial leaders, it lacked that element\r\nof unity and accord which is so essential to an army. The first movement\r\nwas against the castle of Fushimi, which was the centre from which Ieyasu\r\ngoverned the country. After a short siege it fell and then, it is said,\r\nwas accidentally burned to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe news of the attack upon Fushimi was brought to Ieyasu in Shimotsuké,\r\nand a council of his friends and retainers was held to determine what\r\nsteps must be taken to meet the emergency. It was urged that the time had\r\ncome when Ieyasu should meet his enemies, and settle by battle the\r\nquestions which had risen between them. It was determined that all the\r\nscattered troops should be gathered together, and that they should march\r\nto Fushimi prepared to encounter the enemy in battle at whatever point\r\nthey should meet them. The eldest son of Ieyasu, Hideyasu, was put in\r\ncharge of Yedo and entrusted with the care of the surrounding provinces.\r\nThis was an important trust, because the powerful prince Uesugi lay to the\r\nnorth of him and would seize the first opportunity to attack him. To\r\nFukushima was given the command of the vanguard. The principal army was\r\ndivided into two parts, one of which was to march along the Tōkaidō under\r\nthe command of Ieyasu himself, the other was placed under the charge of\r\nIeyasu’s second son Hidetada, and was to take the route along the\r\nNakasendō. The whole army consisted of 75,000 men, a number much smaller\r\nthan the army of the league, but which had the advantage of being\r\ncontrolled by one mastering and experienced commander.\r\n\r\nThe armies met at Sekigahara,(194) a little village on the Nakasendō,\r\nOctober, A.D. 1600. One place on the neighboring hill is still pointed out\r\nwhence Ieyasu witnessed the battle and issued his orders. Both sides\r\nfought with determined bravery, and the battle lasted the whole day.\r\nCannon and other firearms were to some extent made use of, but the\r\nold-fashioned weapons, the sword and the spear, were the terrible means by\r\nwhich the victory was decided. For a long time the battle raged without\r\neither party obtaining a decisive advantage. Notwithstanding his\r\ninferiority in numbers Ieyasu was completely victorious. The carnage was\r\ndreadful. The number of the confederate army said to have been killed was\r\n40,000.(195) This seems like an impossible exaggeration, and the Japanese\r\nannalists are, like those of other nations, given to heightened\r\nstatements. But that the loss of life on both sides was very great there\r\ncan be no doubt.\r\n\r\nTwo ghastly mounds called Kubi-zuka, or head piles, are still shown where\r\nthe heads of the decapitated confederates were buried. This battle must\r\nalways stand with that at Dan-no-ura between the Minamoto and Taira\r\nfamilies, as one of the decisive battles in the history of Japan. By it\r\nwas settled the fate of the country for two hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that the victor in this battle was a man who knew how to\r\nsecure the advantages to be derived from a victory. It is said that at the\r\nclose of this battle when he saw success perching on his banners, he\r\nrepeated to those around him the old Japanese proverb: “After victory\r\ntighten the strings of your helmet.”(196) The division of Hidetada joined\r\nhim after the battle, and he promptly followed up his victory by seizing\r\nthe castles on his way and taking possession of Kyōto and Ōsaka. The\r\nfeudal princes who had stood aloof or opposed him nearly all came forward\r\nand submitted themselves to his authority. Uesugi and Satake in the north,\r\nwho had been among his most active opponents, at once presented themselves\r\nto Hideyasu at Yedo and made their submission. Mōri, the powerful lord of\r\nthe western provinces, who had been most active in the confederation\r\nagainst him, sent congratulations on his victory, but they were coldly\r\nreceived. Finally he was pardoned, being however deprived of six out of\r\nhis eight provinces. He was suffered to retain of all his rich inheritance\r\nonly Suō and Nagato. Several of the leaders were captured, among whom were\r\nMitsunari, Konishi, and Ōtani, who being Christians deemed it unworthy\r\ntheir faith to commit _hara-kiri_. They were carried to Kyōto where they\r\nwere beheaded and their heads exposed in the dry bed of the Kamo-gawa.\r\n\r\nThe work of reducing to order the island of Kyūshū was entrusted to the\r\nveteran generals Katō Kiyomasa and Kuroda Yoshitaka. The former undertook\r\nthe reduction of Hizen, and the latter that of Bungo, Buzen, and Chikuzen.\r\nThe house of Shimazu, although it had taken sides against Ieyasu in the\r\ngreat contest, duly made its submission and was treated with great\r\nconsideration. The whole of the territory assigned to it by Hideyoshi\r\nafter the war of A.D. 1586 was restored to it, namely, the whole of the\r\nprovinces of Satsuma and Ōsumi, and one half of the province of Hyūga. To\r\nKatō Kiyomasa(197) was given the province of Higo, which had, after the\r\nKorean war, been assigned to Konishi in recognition of his services, but\r\nwhich was now taken from his family because he had been one of Ieyasu’s\r\nactive opponents. The Kuroda family received as its inheritance a portion\r\nof the province of Chikuzen with its capital at Fukuoka, which it held\r\nuntil the abolition of feudal tenures in 1871.\r\n\r\nIeyasu was a peaceful and moderate character, and in the settlement of the\r\ndisturbances which had marked his advent to power, he is notable for\r\nhaving pursued a course of great kindness and consideration. With the\r\nexception of the cases already mentioned there were no executions for\r\npolitical offences. It was his desire and ambition to establish a system\r\nof government which should be continuous and not liable, like those of\r\nNobunaga and Taikō Sama, to be overturned at the death of him who had\r\nfounded it. By the gift of Taikō Sama he had already in his possession a\r\nlarge part of the Kwantō. And by the result of the war which had ended at\r\nSekigahara, he had come into possession of a great number of other fiefs,\r\nwith which he could reward those who had been faithful to him. It was the\r\ndifficult and delicate part of his work to distribute judiciously among\r\nhis supporters and retainers the confiscated estates. To realize how\r\ncompletely the feudal system as reformed by Ieyasu was bound to him and\r\nconstituted to support and perpetuate his family, it is only necessary to\r\nexamine such a list of the daimyōs(198) as is given in Appert’s _Ancien\r\nJapon_.(199) Out of the two hundred and sixty-three daimyōs there\r\nenumerated, one hundred and fifty-eight are either vassals or branches of\r\nthe Tokugawa family. But while he thus carefully provided the supports for\r\nhis own family, he spared many of the old and well-rooted houses, which\r\nhad incorporated themselves into the history of the country. He built his\r\nstructure on the old and tried foundation stones. With far-sighted\r\nstatesmanship he recognized that every new form of government, to be\r\npermanent, must be a development from that which precedes it, and must\r\ninclude within itself whatever is lasting in the nature of its forerunner.\r\n\r\nThe dual form of government had for many centuries existed in Japan, and\r\nthe customs and habits of thinking, and the modes of administering justice\r\nand of controlling the conduct of men had become adapted to this system.\r\nIt was therefore natural that Ieyasu should turn his attention to\r\nreforming and perfecting such a form of government. A scheme of this kind\r\nseemed best adapted to a country in which there existed on the one hand an\r\nemperor of divine origin, honored of all men, but who by long neglect had\r\nbecome unfit to govern, and in whom was lodged only the source of honor;\r\nand on the other hand an executive department on which devolved the\r\npractical duty of governing, organizing, maintaining, and defending.\r\nThough he was compelled to look back through centuries of misrule, and\r\nthrough long periods of war and usurpation, he could see straight to\r\nYoritomo, the first of the shōguns, and could trace from him a clear\r\ndescent in the Minamoto family. To this task, therefore, he set himself:\r\nto maintain the empire in all its heaven-descended purity and to create a\r\nline of hereditary shōguns who should constitute its executive department.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, he sent his son Hidetada to the emperor to make\r\na full report of everything that had been done in the settlement of the\r\naffairs of the country. The emperor was graciously pleased to approve his\r\nacts and to bestow upon him, A.D. 1603, the hereditary title of\r\nSei-i-tai-shōgun. This was the title borne by Yoritomo when he was the\r\nreal ruler of the country. Since that time there had been a long line of\r\nshōguns, the last of whom was Ashikaga Yoshiaki, whom Nobunaga deposed in\r\n1573, and who had died 1597. With this new appointment began a line of\r\nTokugawa shōguns that ended only with the restoration in 1868.\r\n\r\nIeyasu’s most radical change in the system of government consisted in the\r\nestablishment of the seat of his executive department at Yedo. Since A.D.\r\n794 Kyōto had been the capital where successive emperors had reigned, and\r\nwhere Nobunaga and Hideyoshi exercised executive control. Kamakura had\r\nbeen the seat of Yoritomo and his successors. But Ieyasu saw advantages in\r\nestablishing himself in a new field, to which the traditions of idleness\r\nand effeminacy had not attached themselves, and where the associations of\r\nhis own warlike career would act as a stimulus to his contemporaries and\r\nsuccessors. He remained at Fushimi until necessary repairs could be made\r\nto the Castle of Yedo(200) and the roads between it and the capital put in\r\norder. The place which henceforth was to be the principal capital of the\r\ncountry first comes into notice, as we have before mentioned, as a castle\r\nbuilt by Ōta Dōkwan in A.D. 1456. He had been placed here by the\r\nauthorities of Kamakura to watch the movements of the restless princes of\r\nthe north. Recognizing the strength and convenience of the high grounds on\r\nthe border of Yedo bay, he built a castle which, through many\r\ntransformations and enlargements, finally developed into the great feudal\r\ncapital of the Tokugawa shōguns. It was here that Ieyasu, after the fall\r\nof Odawara, by the advice of Hideyoshi,(201) established himself for the\r\ngovernment of the provinces of the Kwantō which had been given to him.\r\n\r\nAnd it was without doubt this earlier experience which led him to select\r\nYedo as the centre of his feudal government. The reputation which this\r\neastern region bore for roughness and want of culture, as compared with\r\nthe capital of the emperor at Kyōto, seemed to him an advantage rather\r\nthan an objection. He could here build up a system of government free from\r\nthe faults and weaknesses which had become inseparable from the old seats\r\nof power. After the repairs and enlargements had been completed he took up\r\nhis residence there. Besides this castle, Ieyasu had for his private\r\nresidence, especially after his retirement from the shōgunate, an\r\nestablishment at Sumpu, now called Shizuoka. Here he was visited by\r\nEnglish and Dutch envoys in reference to the terms of allowing trade, and\r\nhere, after the manner of his country, he maintained his hold upon the\r\nadministration of affairs, notwithstanding his formal retirement.\r\n\r\nA continued source of disquietude and danger to the empire, or at least to\r\nthe plans of Ieyasu for a dynasty of Tokugawa shōguns, lay in Hideyori,\r\nthe son and heir of Taikō Sama. He was born in 1592, and was therefore at\r\nthis time, 1614, in his twenty-third year. As long as he lived he would be\r\nnaturally and inevitably the centre to which all the disaffected elements\r\nof the country would gravitate. The failure of Ieyasu to support the cause\r\nof his old master’s son would always prove a source of weakness to him,\r\nespecially in a country where fidelity to parents and superiors was held\r\nin such high esteem. He determined, therefore, to bring to a conclusion\r\nthese threatening troubles which had so long been hanging over him.\r\nAccordingly, on the ground that Hideyori was plotting with his enemies\r\nagainst the peace of the state, he set out from Sumpu, where he was then\r\nresiding as retired shōgun, with an army of seventy thousand men. Hideyori\r\nand his mother had for a long time resided at the castle of Ōsaka, and\r\nagainst this Ieyasu directed his large army. It was bravely and skilfully\r\ndefended, and without the help of artillery, which at this early day was\r\nrarely used in sieges, a long time elapsed before any decided advantage\r\nwas gained. At last the defenders were tempted beyond the protection of\r\ntheir fortifications, and a battle was fought June 3, 1615. It is\r\ndescribed by the Jesuit fathers, two of whom witnessed it, as being\r\nsanguinary beyond the example of the bloody battles of the Japanese civil\r\nwars. It resulted in the complete overthrow of Hideyori’s adherents, and\r\nthe destruction of the castle by fire. Both Hideyori and his mother were\r\nsaid to have perished in the conflagration. Reports were current that they\r\nhad, however, escaped and taken refuge in some friendly locality. But no\r\ntrace of them was ever found, and it was taken for granted that this was\r\nthe end of Hideyori and his party.\r\n\r\nBefore ending this chapter, which is designed to record the establishment\r\nof the Tokugawa shōguns, reference should be made to the settlement of the\r\nquestions left in dispute by Taikō Sama respecting Korea. There remained\r\nafter the war, with all its attendant atrocities and sufferings, a feeling\r\nof intense bitterness towards the Japanese on the part both of the Koreans\r\nand Chinese. The absence of any sufficient cause for the invasion, and the\r\navowed purpose of Taikō Sama to extend his conquests to China had awakened\r\nagainst him and his armies a hatred which generations could not wipe out.\r\nSoon after the recall of the Japanese troops which followed the death of\r\nTaikō Sama, Ieyasu opened negotiations with Korea through the daimyō of\r\nTsushima. He caused the government to be informed that any friendly\r\novertures on its part would be received in a like spirit. The king of\r\nKorea accordingly despatched an embassy with an autograph letter,\r\naddressed to the “King of Japan.” A translation of this letter will be\r\nfound in Mr. Aston’s last paper(202) on Hideyoshi’s invasion of Korea.\r\nAmong other things it says: “The sovereign and subjects of this country\r\nwere profoundly grieved, and felt that they could not live under the same\r\nheaven with your country.... However your country has now reformed the\r\nerrors of the past dynasty and practises the former friendly relations. If\r\nthis be so, is it not a blessing to the people of both countries? We have\r\ntherefore sent you the present embassy in token of friendship. The\r\nenclosed paper contains a list of some poor productions of our country. Be\r\npleased to understand this.” This letter was dated in the year 1607. A\r\nfriendly answer was returned to it, and from this time it may be\r\nunderstood that the relations between the two countries were placed on a\r\nsatisfactory basis. These steps were taken on the part of Korea with the\r\nknowledge and approval of China, which now claimed to hold a protectorate\r\nover the peninsula of Korea. The same negotiations therefore which\r\nresulted in peaceful relations with Korea brought about a condition of\r\namity with China which was not disturbed until very recent times.\r\n\r\nThe ruinous effects of this invasion, however, were never overcome in\r\nKorea itself. Her cities had been destroyed, her industries blotted out,\r\nand her fertile fields rendered desolate. Once she had been the fruitful\r\ntree from which Japan was glad to gather her arts and civilization, but\r\nnow she was only a branchless trunk which the fires of war had charred and\r\nleft standing.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             Tokugawa Crest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. CHRISTIANITY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the readers of the story of Japan the most interesting episode is that\r\nof the introduction and subsequent extirpation of Christianity. We have\r\ntherefore given an account of the first arrival of the Jesuit missionaries\r\nwith the sainted Xavier at their head, and we have seen their labors\r\ncrowned with a very wide success. During the times of Nobunaga and\r\nHideyoshi the question had assumed something of a political aspect. In\r\nseveral of the provinces of Kyūshū the princes had become converts and had\r\nfreely used their influence, and sometimes their authority, to extend\r\nChristianity among their subjects. In Kyōto and Yamaguchi, in Ōsaka and\r\nSakai, as well as in Kyūshū, the Jesuit fathers had founded flourishing\r\nchurches and exerted a wide influence. They had established colleges where\r\nthe candidates for the church could be educated and trained. They had\r\norganized hospitals and asylums at Nagasaki and elsewhere, where those\r\nneeding aid could be received and treated.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the progress of the work had met with a severe setback in\r\nA.D. 1587, when Taikō Sama issued an edict expelling all foreign religious\r\nteachers from Japan. In pursuance of this edict nine foreigners who had\r\nevaded expulsion were burnt at Nagasaki. The reason for this decisive\r\naction on the part of Taikō Sama is usually attributed to the suspicion\r\nwhich had been awakened in him by the loose and unguarded talk of a\r\nPortuguese sea captain.(203) But other causes undoubtedly contributed to\r\nproduce in him this intolerant frame of mind. Indeed, the idea of\r\ntoleration as applied to religious belief had not yet been admitted even\r\nin Europe. At this very time Philip II., who had united in his own person\r\nthe kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, was endeavoring to compel, by force of\r\narms, the Netherlands to accept his religious belief, and was engaged\r\nthroughout all his immense dominions in the task of reducing men’s minds\r\nto a hideous uniformity.\r\n\r\nEven in several of the provinces of Japan where the Jesuits had attained\r\nthe ascendancy, the most forcible measures had been taken by the Christian\r\nprinces to compel all their subjects to follow their own example and adopt\r\nthe Christian faith. Takeyama, whom the Jesuit fathers designate as Justo\r\nUcondono, carried out in his territory at Akashi a system of bitter\r\npersecution. He gave his subjects the option of becoming Christians or\r\nleaving his territory. Konishi Yukinaga, who received part of the province\r\nof Higo as his fief after the Korean war enforced with great persistency\r\nthe acceptance of the Christian faith, and robbed the Buddhist priests of\r\ntheir temples and their lands. The princes of Ōmura and Arima, and to a\r\ncertain extent the princes of Bungo, followed the advice of the Jesuit\r\nfathers in using their authority to advance the cause of Christianity. The\r\nfathers could scarcely complain of having the system of intolerance\r\npractised upon them, which, when circumstances were favorable, they had\r\nadvised to be applied to their opponents. It was this impossibility of\r\nsecuring peace and harmony, and the suspicion of the territorial ambition\r\nof Spain and Portugal, which drove Taikō Sama to the conclusion that the\r\nforeign religious teachers and the faith which they had so successfully\r\npropagated, were a source of imminent danger to his country. To him it was\r\npurely a political question. He had no deep religious impressions which\r\nhad led him to prefer the precepts of the old Japanese faith to those of\r\nChristianity. These systems could not apparently live together, and it\r\nseemed to him the safest and most sensible way to extinguish the weaker\r\nand most dangerous before it became too strong. Hence he began that policy\r\nof repression and expulsion which his successor reluctantly took up.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of Ieyasu’s supremacy the Christians were not\r\ndisturbed. He was too much occupied with the establishment of the new\r\nexecutive department which he had planned. In 1606 the Portuguese resident\r\nbishop, Father Louis Cerqueria, was received by Ieyasu at Kyōto. The\r\nfathers speak of this audience with great hopefulness, and did not seem to\r\nbe aware that the court which most of the Christian princes were at that\r\ntime paying to Hideyori was likely to prejudice Ieyasu against them. Again\r\nin 1607 Ieyasu, who was then at Kofu in the province of Kai awaiting the\r\ncompletion of his castle at Yedo, expressed a desire to see the\r\nProvincial. Accordingly when he waited on Ieyasu he was received very\r\ncordially. The Christian fathers were much encouraged by these indications\r\nof the favor of Ieyasu. But whatever they may have been, they cannot be\r\ninterpreted as showing any intention on his part to promote their\r\nreligious proselytism. Even in the very midst of these assumed favors he\r\nissued in 1606 what may be called a warning proclamation,(204) announcing\r\nthat he had learned with pain that, contrary to Taikō Sama’s edict, many\r\nhad embraced the Christian religion. He warned all officers of his court\r\nto see that the edict was strictly enforced. He declared that it was for\r\nthe good of the state that none should embrace the new doctrine; and that\r\nsuch as had already done so must change immediately.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation of Ieyasu did not, however, prevent the Catholics at\r\nNagasaki from celebrating in a gorgeous manner the beatification(205) of\r\nIgnatius Loyola, the founder and first General of the Society of Jesus.\r\nThe bishop officiated in pontifical robes, and the members of the society,\r\ntogether with the Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians, made a solemn\r\nprocession through the city. This celebration was in distinct\r\ncontravention of the orders which had been issued against such public\r\ndisplays. It was made more emphatic by being also held on the same day in\r\nthe province of Arima, whose daimyō was an ardent advocate of the\r\nChristian doctrine. These open and determined infractions of the\r\ndirections of the government provoked Ieyasu to take severe measures. He\r\nbegan by punishing some of the native Christians connected with his own\r\ncourt, who were charged with bribery and intrigue in behalf of the daimyō\r\nof Arima. A number of these accused Christians were banished and their\r\nestates confiscated.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime both the English and Dutch had appeared on the scene, as\r\nwill be more fully detailed in the next chapter. Their object was solely\r\ntrade, and as the Portuguese monopoly hitherto had been mainly secured by\r\nthe Jesuit fathers, it was natural for the new-comers to represent the\r\nmotive of these fathers in an unfavorable and suspicious light. “Indeed,”\r\nas Hildreth(206) says, “they had only to confirm the truth of what the\r\nPortuguese and Spanish said of each other to excite in the minds of the\r\nJapanese rulers the gravest distrust as to the designs of the priests of\r\nboth nations.”(207)\r\n\r\nWhether it is true as charged that the minds of the Japanese rulers had\r\nbeen poisoned against the Jesuit fathers by misrepresentation and\r\nfalsehood, it may be impossible to determine definitely; but it is fair to\r\ninfer that the cruel and intolerant policy of the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nwould be fully set forth and the danger to the Japanese empire from the\r\nmachinations of the foreign religious teachers held up in the worst light.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of Ieyasu’s life, after he had settled the affairs\r\nof the empire and put the shōgunate upon a permanent basis, we see growing\r\nevidence of his prejudice against Christianity. That he had such prejudice\r\nin a very pronounced form is clear from his reference to the “false and\r\ncorrupt school” in chapter xxxi. of the _Legacy_. And he had inherited\r\nfrom Taikō Sama the conviction that the spread of this foreign faith was a\r\nmenace to the peace of the empire. The instructions(208) which were issued\r\nto the members of the Society of Jesus, however, forbade any father to\r\nmeddle in secular affairs or to interfere in any way with the political\r\nconcerns of the government in which they were laboring. That there were\r\noccasional instances of the disregard of this regulation by the\r\nenthusiastic members of the order may be supposed, but it will be unjust\r\nand unfounded to attribute to this society a settled policy of\r\ninterference in the affairs of the nations where they were employed as\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nIeyasu, evidently having made up his mind that for the safety of the\r\nempire Christianity must be extirpated, in 1614 issued an edict(209) that\r\nthe members of all religious orders, whether European or Japanese, should\r\nbe sent out of the country; that the churches which had been erected in\r\nvarious localities should be pulled down, and that the native adherents of\r\nthe faith should be compelled to renounce it. In part execution of this\r\nedict all the members of the Society of Jesus, native and foreign, were\r\nordered to be sent to Nagasaki. Native Christians were sent to Tsugaru,\r\nthe northern extremity of the Main island. Takeyama, who had already been\r\nbanished by Taikō Sama to the province of Kaga, was ordered to leave the\r\ncountry. He was sent in a Chinese ship to Manila, where he soon after\r\ndied. In order to repress any disturbance that might arise from the\r\nexecution of this edict, ten thousand troops were sent to Kyūshū, where\r\nthe converts were much the most numerous, and where the daimyōs in many\r\ncases either openly protected or indirectly favored the new faith.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this edict, as many as three hundred persons are said\r\nto have been shipped from Japan October 25, 1614. All the resident Jesuits\r\nwere included in this number, excepting eighteen fathers and nine\r\nbrothers, who concealed themselves and thus escaped the search. Following\r\nthis deportation of converts the most persistent efforts continued to be\r\nmade to force the native Christians to renounce their faith. The accounts\r\ngiven, both by the foreign and by the Japanese writers, of the\r\npersecutions which now broke upon the heads of the Christians are beyond\r\ndescription horrible. A special service was established by the government\r\nwhich was called the Christian Enquiry,(210) the object of which was to\r\nsearch out Christians in every quarter and drive them to a renunciation of\r\ntheir faith. Both the foreign priests who had remained in the country in\r\nspite of the edict and the native converts were hunted down and punished\r\nwith the most appalling tortures. Rewards were offered for information\r\ninvolving Christians of every position and rank, even of parents against\r\ntheir children and of children against their parents. At what time this\r\npractice began it is difficult to say, but that rewards were used at an\r\nearly period is evident from the re-issue of an edict in 1655, in which it\r\nis stated(211) that formerly a reward of 200 pieces of silver was paid for\r\ndenouncing a father (_bateren_) and 100 for denouncing a brother\r\n(_iruman_); but from this time the rewards should be: for denouncing a\r\nfather, 300 pieces; a brother, 200 pieces; and a catechist, 50 pieces. In\r\n1711 this tariff was raised, for denouncing a father to 500 pieces, a\r\nbrother to 300 pieces, and a catechist to 100 pieces; also for denouncing\r\na person who, having recanted, returned to the faith, 300 pieces. These\r\nedicts against Christianity were displayed on the edict-boards as late as\r\nthe year 1868.\r\n\r\nThe persecution began in its worst form about 1616. This was the year in\r\nwhich Ieyasu died, but his son and successor carried out the terrible\r\nprogramme with heartless thoroughness. It has never been surpassed for\r\ncruelty and brutality on the part of the persecutors, or for courage and\r\nconstancy on the part of those who suffered. The letters of the Jesuit\r\nfathers are full of descriptions of the shocking trials to which the\r\nChristians were subjected. The tortures inflicted are almost beyond\r\nbelief. Mr. Gubbins, in the paper(212) to which reference has already been\r\nmade, says: “We read of Christians being executed in a barbarous manner in\r\nsight of each other, of their being hurled from the tops of precipices, of\r\ntheir being buried alive, of their being torn asunder by oxen, of their\r\nbeing tied up in rice-bags, which were heaped up together, and of the pile\r\nthus formed being set on fire. Others were tortured before death by the\r\ninsertion of sharp spikes under the nails of their hands and feet, while\r\nsome poor wretches by a refinement of horrid cruelty were shut up in cages\r\nand there left to starve with food before their eyes. Let it not be\r\nsupposed that we have drawn on the Jesuit accounts solely for this\r\ninformation. An examination of the Japanese records will show that the\r\ncase is not overstated.”(213)\r\n\r\nThe region around Nagasaki was most fully impregnated with the new\r\ndoctrine, and it was here that the persecution was by far the most severe.\r\nThis was now an imperial city, governed directly by officers from the\r\ngovernment of Yedo. The governor is called Kanwaytsdo by Warenius, relying\r\non Caron and Guysbert, but I have been unable to identify him by his true\r\nJapanese name. Beginning from 1616 there was a continuous succession of\r\npersecutions. In 1622 one hundred and thirty men, women, and children were\r\nput to death, among whom were two Spanish priests, and Spinola an Italian.\r\nThe next year one hundred more were put to death. The heroism of these\r\nmartyrs awakened the greatest enthusiasm among the Christians. In the\r\ndarkness of the night following the execution many of them crept to the\r\nplace where their friends had been burnt and tenderly plucked some charred\r\nfragments of their bodies, which they carried away and cherished as\r\nprecious relics. To prevent the recurrence of such practices the officers\r\ndirected that the bodies of those burnt should be completely consumed and\r\nthe ashes thrown into the sea. Guysbert in his account mentions that among\r\nthose executed at Hirado was a man who had been in the employ of the Dutch\r\nfactory and his wife. They had two little boys whom the factor offered to\r\ntake and have brought up by the Dutch. But the parents declined, saying\r\nthat they preferred to have the boys die with them. A plan was devised by\r\nwhich the heads of households were required to certify that none of their\r\nfamilies were Christians, and that no priests or converts were harbored by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll this terrible exercise of power and the constantly recurring scenes of\r\nsuffering were more than the governor could endure, and so we find him at\r\nlast complaining that he could not sleep and that his health was impaired.\r\nAt his earnest petition he was relieved and a new governor appointed in\r\n1626. He signalized his entrance upon his duties by condemning thirteen\r\nChristians to be burnt, viz.: Bishop Franciscus Parquerus, a Portuguese,\r\nseventy years old; Balthazar de Tores, a Dominican, fifty-seven years old,\r\ntogether with five Portuguese and five Japanese laymen. When it came to\r\nthe crisis the five Portuguese renounced their faith and escaped death. On\r\nthe twelfth of July nine more were executed, five by burning and four by\r\nbeheading. On the twenty-ninth of July a priest was caught and executed\r\nwho had concealed himself in a camp of lepers, and who had hoped in that\r\nway to escape detection.\r\n\r\nThe governor exerted himself to bring about recantations on the part of\r\nthose who had professed themselves Christians. He promised special favors\r\nto such as would renounce their faith, and in many cases went far beyond\r\npromises to secure the result. He set a day when all the apostates dressed\r\nin their best clothes should present themselves at his office. Fifteen\r\nhundred appeared on this occasion, and were treated with the greatest\r\nkindness and consideration. But the officers began to see that putting\r\nChristians to death would not prevent others from embracing the same\r\ndoctrine. There grew up such an enthusiasm among the faithful that they\r\nsought rather than avoided the crown of martyrdom. As Guysbert points out,\r\nthe knowledge of the Christian religion possessed by these converts must\r\nhave been exceedingly small; they knew the Lord’s prayer and the _Ave\r\nMaria_, and a few other prayers of the Church, but they had not the\r\nScriptures to read, and many of them could not have read them even if they\r\nhad been translated into their own language. And yet these humble and\r\nignorant people withstood death, and tortures far worse than death, with a\r\nheroism worthy of all praise.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of February, 1627, twelve persons were captured in a\r\nhiding-place about a mile from Nagasaki; they were first branded with a\r\nhot iron on the forehead, and then on each cheek; then because they would\r\nnot recant they were burnt to death. Subsequently forty more were\r\ncaptured, among whom were a father and mother with their three young\r\nchildren. The children were frightened at the dreadful preparations, and\r\nwould have recanted, but their parents refused to permit them to take\r\nadvantage of the offers of clemency. After the branding and beating, those\r\nwho were not yet driven to recant were sent off to the boiling springs of\r\nOnsen in Arima. Here they were tortured by having the boiling water of the\r\nsprings poured upon them, and by being compelled to breathe the\r\nsuffocating sulphurous air which these springs emitted.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of the following May, nine martyrs suffered all the\r\ntorments which could be contrived and finally were drowned. August\r\nseventeenth five Christians were burnt and eighteen otherwise put to\r\ndeath, of whom one was a Franciscan monk and the rest were natives.\r\nOctober twenty-sixth three Japanese magnates who had joined Hideyori\r\nagainst Ieyasu were discovered to be Christians, and were shipped off to\r\nMacao. In the following year, 1628, it is said that three hundred and\r\nforty-eight persons were tortured for their faith, including torture by\r\nthe boiling springs, beating with clubs, and burning. It had been reduced\r\nto such a science that when they saw a subject becoming weak and likely to\r\ndie, they suspended their torments until he revived. Whenever a priest was\r\ncaptured in any household the whole family by whom he had been concealed\r\nwere put to death.\r\n\r\nAnother new governor was sent to Nagasaki on the 27th of July, 1629. He\r\ncame with the high purpose of rooting out every vestige of Christianity.\r\nHe set about his work in the most systematic manner. Nagasaki, it must be\r\nunderstood, is laid out in streets which can be closed up by gates. Each\r\nstreet had its head man, and every five houses in each street were under\r\nthe special charge of a separate overseer. These overseers were\r\nresponsible as to what occurred and who were concealed in each of the\r\nhouses under his charge. The gates were all closed at night and opened\r\nagain in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe governor went through these streets house by house, and examined every\r\nperson in every house. If the occupants were not Christians, or if they\r\nrenounced their Christianity, they were allowed to go undisturbed; but if\r\nany one persisted in the new doctrine he was sent off to be tortured by\r\nhot water at the boiling springs. This torture was now improved by\r\nrequiring the victim to have his back slit open and the boiling water\r\npoured directly on the raw flesh. He used the most monstrous means to\r\nforce the people to renounce their faith. He compelled naked women to go\r\nthrough the streets on their hands and knees, and many recanted rather\r\nthan suffer such an ordeal. Other cases are recorded too horrible to be\r\nrelated, and which only the ingenuity of hell could have devised. That any\r\nshould have persisted after such inhuman persecutions seems to be almost\r\nbeyond belief. Guysbert says that in 1626 Nagasaki had forty thousand\r\nChristians, and in 1629 not one was left who acknowledged himself a\r\nbeliever. The governor was proud that he had virtually exterminated\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nBut the extermination had not yet been attained. The severity of the\r\nmeasures adopted in Nagasaki had indeed driven many into the surrounding\r\nprovinces, so that every place of shelter was full. They awaited in terror\r\nthe time when they too should be summoned to torture and death. Usually\r\nthey had not long to wait, for the service of the Christian Enquiry was\r\nactive and diligent. New refinements of cruelty were constantly invented\r\nand applied. The last and one of the most effectual is denominated by the\r\nforeign historians of these scenes the _Torment of the Fosse_. Mathia\r\nTanner, S. J., in his _History of the Martyrs of Japan_, published in\r\nPrague, 1675, gives minute accounts of many martyrdoms. His descriptions\r\nare illustrated by sickening engravings of the tortures inflicted. Among\r\nthese he gives one illustrating the suspension of a martyr in a pit on the\r\n16th of August, 1633. The victim is swathed in a covering which confines\r\nall parts of the body except one hand with which he can make the signal of\r\nrecantation. A post is planted by the side of the pit, with an arm\r\nprojecting out over it. The martyr is then drawn up by a rope fastened to\r\nthe feet and run over the arm of the post. He is then lowered into the pit\r\nto a depth of five or six feet and there suffered to hang. The suffering\r\nwas excruciating. Blood exuded from the mouth and nose, and the sense of\r\npressure on the brain was fearful. Yet with all this suffering the victim\r\nusually lived eight or nine days. Few could endure this torture, and it\r\nproved a most effectual method of bringing about recantations. Guysbert\r\nsays that he had many friendly conversations with those who had\r\nexperienced the torture of the _Fosse_. They solemnly assured him “that\r\nneither the pain caused by burning with fire, nor that caused by any other\r\nkind of torture, deserves to be compared with the agony produced in this\r\nway.” Not being able longer to endure the suffering, they had recanted and\r\nbeen set free. Yet it is told as a miraculous triumph of faith that a\r\nyoung girl was submitted to this torture, and lived fifteen days without\r\nrecanting and at last died.\r\n\r\nIt is surely not unnatural that human nature should succumb to such\r\ntorments. Even the well seasoned nerves of the Jesuit fathers were not\r\nalways able to endure to the end. The enemies of the Jesuits delight in\r\nnarrating the apostasy of Father Christopher Ferreyra, seventy years old,\r\na Portuguese missionary and the provincial of the order. He was captured\r\nin Nagasaki, 1633, and was tortured by suspension in the _Fosse_. After\r\nfive hours he gave the signal of recantation and was released. He was kept\r\nfor some time in prison and compelled to give information concerning the\r\nmembers of his order in Japan. He was set at liberty and forced to marry,\r\nassuming the Japanese dress and a Japanese name. There was a report set on\r\nfoot by the Jesuits that in his old age when on his death-bed he recovered\r\nhis courage and declared himself a Christian, whereupon he was immediately\r\ncarried off by the Japanese officers to the torture of the _Fosse_, where\r\nhe perished a penitent martyr.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the method of trial called _E-fumi_,(214) or\r\ntrampling on the cross, was instituted. At first pictures on paper were\r\nused, then slabs of wood were substituted as more durable, and finally in\r\nthe year 1660 an engraver of Nagasaki, named Yusa, cast bronze plates from\r\nthe metal obtained by despoiling the altars of the churches. These plates\r\nwere about five inches long and four inches wide and one inch thick, and\r\nhad on them a figure of Christ on the cross. We take from the French\r\nedition of Kæmpfer’s _History of Japan_(215) an account of what he calls\r\n“this detestable solemnity.” It was conducted by an officer called the\r\n_kirishitan bugyō_, or Christian inquisitor, and began on the second day\r\nof the first month. In Nagasaki it was commenced at two different places\r\nat once, and was carried on from house to house until the whole city was\r\nfinished. The officers of each street were required to be present. The\r\nmetal plate on which was a figure of the Saviour upon the cross was laid\r\nupon the floor. Then the head of the house, his family, and servants of\r\nboth sexes, old and young, and any lodgers that might be in the house,\r\nwere called into the room. The secretary of the inquisitor thereupon made\r\na list of the household and called upon them one by one to set their feet\r\non the plate. Even young children not able to walk were carried by their\r\nmothers and made to step on the images with their feet. Then the head of\r\nthe family put his seal to the list as a certificate to be laid before the\r\ngovernor that the inquisition had been performed in his house. If any\r\nrefused thus to trample on the cross they were at once turned over to the\r\nproper officers to be tortured as the cases required.\r\n\r\nThis same method of trial was used in the provinces about Nagasaki, the\r\ngovernor lending to the officers the plate which they might use.\r\n\r\nWithout following the entire series of events which resulted in the\r\nextirpation of Christianity, it will be sufficient to give a brief\r\nnarrative of the closing act in this fearful tragedy. It is just, however,\r\nto explain that the Shimabara rebellion was not due to the Christians\r\nalone, but that other causes contributed to and perhaps originated it. In\r\nview, however, of the cruel persecutions to which the Christians were\r\nsubjected, it is not surprising that they should have been driven to\r\nengage in such a rebellion as that in Arima.(216) The wonder rather is\r\nthat they were not often and in many places impelled to take up arms\r\nagainst the inhumanities of their rulers. The explanation of this absence\r\nof resistance will be found in the scattered condition of the Christian\r\ncommunities. Nowhere, unless it might be in Nagasaki, was the number of\r\nconverts collected in one place at all considerable. They were everywhere\r\noverawed by the organized power of the government, and the experience of\r\nthose who joined in this Arima insurrection did not encourage a repetition\r\nof its horrors.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the revolt is traced to the misgovernment of the daimyō\r\nof Arima. The original daimyō had been transferred by the shōgun to\r\nanother province, and when he removed from Arima he left nearly all his\r\nold retainers behind him. The newly instituted daimyō, on the contrary,\r\nwho came to occupy the vacated province brought with him a full complement\r\nof his own followers. To make room for these new retainers the old ones\r\nwere displaced placed from their dwellings and holdings, and compelled to\r\nbecome farmers or to take up any other occupation which they could find.\r\nLike the _samurai_ of other parts of Japan who had been unaccustomed to\r\nany calling except that of arms, these displaced retainers proved very\r\nunsuccessful farmers, and were of course very much dissatisfied with the\r\nnew course of things. The daimyō was a cruel and inconsiderate man, who\r\nmade small account of the hardships and complaints of the _samurai_\r\nfarmers. The taxes were made heavier than they could pay, and when they\r\nfailed to bring in the required amount of rice, he ordered them to be\r\ndressed in straw rain-coats which were tied around their neck and arms.\r\nTheir hands were fastened behind their backs, and in this helpless\r\ncondition the rain-coats were set on fire. Many were fatally burned, and\r\nsome to escape the burning threw themselves into the water and were\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nThis senseless cruelty awakened an intense feeling of hatred against the\r\ndaimyō. And when his son who succeeded him was disposed to continue the\r\nsame tyrannical policy, the farmers rose in insurrection against their\r\nlord. The peasants of the island of Amakusa, which lies directly opposite\r\nto the province of Arima, also joined in this rising, owing to their\r\ndiscontent against the daimyō of Karatsu.\r\n\r\nThe Christians, who had so long groaned under the persecutions of their\r\nrulers, seized this opportunity to rise, and joined the farmers. They\r\ndeclared that the time had now come for them to avenge the innocent blood\r\nof Christians and priests who had perished throughout the empire. The\r\nrising of the Christians began at the village of Oyei in Amakusa, October,\r\n1637. The excitement was intense, and in a few days it is said that eight\r\nthousand three hundred men and one thousand women were assembled at this\r\nvillage. They chose as their chief Shirō Tokisada, the son of the head man\r\nof the village of Hara, who proposed to march immediately upon Nagasaki\r\nand open negotiations with foreign nations, and if possible obtain from\r\nthem the help of troops. He was an enthusiast and without experience in\r\nwar. The leading spirit in the insurrection seems to have been a\r\n_rônin_(217) named Ashizuka, who recommended that the insurgents should\r\ncross over to Shimabara. But Shirō and his enthusiastic followers resolved\r\nto attack the castle of Tomioka situated on the north-west coast of\r\nAmakusa. They were, however, unable to make any impression upon it, and\r\nwere obliged to withdraw. Ashizuka and a few followers succeeded in\r\nbreaking into the castle of Shimabara and seizing the arms and ammunition\r\nand provisions which were stored there. The government rice stores were\r\nseized both on the mainland and on the island of Amakusa. All the\r\ninsurgents, including men, women, and children, then gathered into a\r\ndeserted castle at Hara, which was capable of holding 40,000 to 50,000\r\npersons. It was supposed to be impregnable, and was put in order and\r\nprovisioned for a long siege. The number gathered here is estimated by the\r\nJapanese writers at 40,200, but this number without doubt is an\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\nThe local rulers finding themselves unable to cope with the rebellion, and\r\nseeing its proportions swelling every day, appealed to Yedo for help. The\r\nshōgun at this time was Iemitsu, the son of the preceding shōgun, and\r\ngrandson of Ieyasu. He possessed many of the good qualities of his\r\ngrandfather, and is looked upon, with the exception of Ieyasu, as the\r\ngreatest of the Tokugawa line. He had imbibed all the prejudices of his\r\npredecessors against foreigners and against the religion of the\r\nforeigners. He feared that this rebellion was begun at their instigation,\r\nand would be carried on with their encouragement and help. He prepared\r\ntherefore for a sharp and desperate struggle, which he was determined\r\nshould be carried out to the bitter end.\r\n\r\nItakura Naizen was sent down as commander-in-chief, and given full powers.\r\nUnder his direction the siege of the castle, in which the rebels were\r\ngathered, was commenced on the 31st of December, 1637. The daimyōs of\r\nKyūshū, on the demand of the government, sent additional troops, so that\r\nthe besieging army amounted to 160,000 men. Yet with all this force, urged\r\non by an ambition to end this rebellion, no serious effect had yet been\r\nproduced on the castle. The attacks which had been made had produced no\r\nbreach in its walls. We have no information concerning the progress of\r\naffairs among the inmates. It must be remembered that a part of the rebels\r\nwere _samurai_ farmers, who were inured to arms, and who knew perfectly\r\nthat neither consideration nor mercy would be shown them or their families\r\nin case the castle were taken. The remainder of the besieged force were\r\nthe Christian insurgents, who had been driven to this rebellion by their\r\ncruel persecution. Nothing could be worse than what they had already\r\nendured, and they had no expectation that if they were beaten in this\r\ncontest any pity would be shown to them. Despair made the attitude of both\r\ndivisions of the rebels one of determined resistance, and their obstinacy\r\nled the besiegers to put forth every effort.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             Pleasure Yacht.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             Pleasure Yacht.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             Merchant Vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne step which they took in this matter led to much discussion and to the\r\nwidening of the breach between the Dutch and the Portuguese. On the 11th\r\nof January, 1638, the besiegers applied to the Dutch at Hirado for a\r\nsupply of gunpowder, which request was complied with, and at the same time\r\nan apology was tendered that no larger quantity could be sent. Again, on\r\nthe 15th of February a request for cannon to be used in the siege was\r\nreceived, and the guns were sent. Mr. Koeckebacker says: “We gave the\r\nlargest and most uniform guns in our possession.”(218) Finally, on the\r\n19th of February, Mr. Koeckebacker was asked to send one of the Dutch\r\nships(219) then at Hirado to the assistance of the besiegers. The _de Ryp_\r\nwas accordingly sent, and Mr. Koeckebacker himself accompanied her. The\r\nguns which had been first sent were mounted as a land battery, and the\r\nguns of the _de Ryp_ from her anchorage in the bay were trained on the\r\ncastle. It was a new experience for the Japanese to see cannon used in the\r\nsiege of a castle, but the effect was much less than had been expected. No\r\npracticable breach was made, and the final result seemed as far off as\r\never. “During the fifteen days from the 24th of February to the 12th of\r\nMarch, there were thrown into the camp of the enemy four hundred and\r\ntwenty-six cannon balls from the twenty guns of the ship _de Ryp_.”(220)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Japanese officers began to feel that it was not a\r\ndignified proceeding to call upon a foreign nation to help them to put\r\ndown a local rebellion. Even the insurgents had shot an arrow into the\r\nimperial camp to which a letter was attached, deriding them for calling\r\nfor assistance when there were so many courageous soldiers in Japan.\r\nWhatever may have been the cause, the Dutch received notice on the 12th of\r\nMarch that their ship was no longer required, and accordingly they\r\nreturned to Hirado. The castle was taken by assault on the 12th of April,\r\n1638, after a siege which had lasted one hundred and two days, and about\r\nseven months from the breaking out of the rebellion. By special orders\r\nfrom Yedo the insurgents captured in the castle were to the last man,\r\nwoman, and child put to death.(221) The father of Shirō, the young leader,\r\nwas crucified, and Shirō himself was decapitated, and his head exposed for\r\nseven days on the great pier at Nagasaki. The daimyō, whose misgovernment\r\nhad brought on this rebellion in Amakusa, was stripped of most of his\r\nterritories, and he was so intensely hated in what remained to him that he\r\ncommitted _hara-kiri_. The daimyō of Arima, whose misconduct and neglect\r\nhad driven the _samurai_ farmers into their fatal rising, was also\r\npermitted to take his own life.\r\n\r\nThe help, which the Dutch rendered in this siege, exposed them to much\r\nvituperation. Naturally, the Jesuit historians have taken a very\r\nunfavorable view of the Dutch share in this sad transaction. Dr. Geerts in\r\nhis defence of the Dutch argues: “Koeckebacker did no more than any one\r\nelse of any nationality would probably have done in the same difficult\r\nposition.... His endeavor was to preserve from decline or destruction the\r\ninterests intrusted to him, and this was done at the smallest possible\r\nprice.... Moreover, the letters of Koeckebacker clearly show that the\r\nJapanese government did not ask the aid of the Dutch in the persecution of\r\nChristians, as has often been asserted by foreign authors, who have not\r\ntaken the trouble to inform themselves thoroughly on the subject, but they\r\nrequested the guns and the aid of the Dutch vessel for the purpose of\r\nsubduing rebellious subjects.... There could be no valid reason for\r\nKoeckebacker to refuse the pressing request for aid, and consequently he\r\nagreed to give assistance, as every wise man would have done in his\r\nplace.... Koeckebacker did not take part in the general massacre which\r\nfollowed on the 11th of April, when the fortress of the rebels was taken\r\nby the imperial troops, as he left with his ship for Hirado on the 12th of\r\nMarch, leaving the guns behind in Arima. Had it been in his power to\r\nprevent such a general massacre after the fortress had been taken, and the\r\nrebels were prisoners, he would no doubt have done so.”(222)\r\n\r\nThis frightful termination to the rebellion, followed as it was by severe\r\nand persistent measures against Christians everywhere, was apparently the\r\ndeath-blow to the church in the empire. No further efforts were made,\r\neither by the daimyōs of provinces or by the heads of the church, to make\r\nopen headway against the determined efforts of the government. Whatever\r\nwas done was in secret, and every means was tried on the part of those who\r\nstill clung to the Christian belief, and especially of those who were\r\nstill daring enough to try to minister to them, to conceal their locality\r\nand their identity.(223)\r\n\r\nThe history of Christianity in Japan from this time downward was that of a\r\nscattered and dismembered remnant struggling for existence. A long line of\r\nedicts reaching to modern times was directed against “the corrupt sect,”\r\nrepeating again and again the directions for its suppression. The\r\n_kirishitan bugyō_, or Christian inquisitor, had his office in Yedo, and\r\nunder him was a numerous and active corps of assistants. Inouye\r\nChikugo-no-Kami for a long time held this position. A place is still\r\npointed out called _Karishitan Zaka_, or Christian Valley, where once\r\nstood the house in which were confined a number of the foreign priests.\r\nHere may be seen the grave of Father Chiara, who had under torture abjured\r\nhis faith, and remained a prisoner for forty years, dying 1685.(224)\r\nProfessor Dixon says that “there are two bamboo tubes inserted in sockets\r\nin front of the tomb, which I have never found empty, but always full of\r\nflowers in bloom. No one knows who offer these flowers, but they must be\r\ndescendants of the Doshin Christians, or believers in Christianity, or\r\nworshippers of Koshin.” Here also was confined Father Baptiste Sidotti, a\r\nSicilian Jesuit who ventured to enter Japan in 1707 with the purpose of\r\nresuming the work of the Jesuits which the persecution had interrupted.\r\n\r\nAnd yet with all this vigilance and severity on the part of the\r\ngovernment, what was the amazement of the Christian world to learn that\r\nthe old faith still survived! In the villages around Nagasaki there were\r\ndiscovered in 1865,(225) not only words and symbols which had been\r\npreserved in the language, but even communities where had been kept alive\r\nfor more than two centuries the worship bequeathed to them by their\r\nancestors. We shall have occasion hereafter to refer to this interesting\r\nmemento of the Christianity of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. FEUDALISM IN JAPAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIeyasu was not only a general of eminent abilities, who had from his youth\r\nbeen accustomed to the responsibility and management of great campaigns,\r\nbut he was a statesman who knew how to secure the advantage to be obtained\r\nfrom victories and conquests. After the decisive battle of Sekigahara,\r\nwhen the control of the empire became fixed in his hands, we hear little\r\nmore of him as a general, excepting in the battle at Ōsaka, when the\r\nfortunes of Hideyori were finally and definitely settled. The common\r\nconception of Ieyasu is not that of a great commander like Hideyoshi, but\r\nrather of an organizer and law-maker, who out of confused and dismembered\r\nprovinces and principalities of the empire constructed a firm and abiding\r\nstate.(226) After his settlement of the dissensions at home, and his\r\nadmirable adjustment of the outstanding difficulties with Korea and China,\r\nwhich we have already traced, we shall find Ieyasu principally engaged in\r\nframing a government which should be suited to the peculiar wants and\r\nfounded on the historical antecedents of the country.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                 Ieyasu.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one characteristic of Ieyasu which has not received sufficient\r\nattention. Although not a great scholar in any sense, even in the age in\r\nwhich he lived, he was more familiar than most men of affairs of his day\r\nwith the Chinese classical writings, and was in the more leisurely periods\r\nof his life a noted patron of learned men. The Chinese classics were said\r\nto have been brought to Japan at an early period, even before the first\r\nintroduction of Buddhism. But the period was too early and the condition\r\nof the country too rude to make the reading and study of the philosophical\r\nand political writings of Confucius and Mencius an essential part of the\r\neducation of the people. The culture which Buddhism brought with it,\r\naccompanied with a knowledge of the writing and reading of the Chinese\r\nletters, was all that obtained any currency during the disturbed and\r\nwarlike ages of Japanese history. But when peace was at last established\r\nby the supremacy of Ieyasu, and the active Japanese intellect had some\r\nother employment than fighting, then learning took a great start. And as\r\nthe only idea which the Japanese possessed of learning was that which\r\nprevailed in China and was imbedded in the Chinese writings, they\r\nnaturally turned to them for thought and systematic training.\r\n\r\nFortunately Ieyasu was a man who appreciated at its full value the effect\r\nof learning on the character of his people. He caused the Confucian\r\nclassics(227) to be printed at a press which he patronized in Fushimi, and\r\nthis was said to be the first time these works had ever been printed in\r\nJapan. He gathered scholars about him at Fushimi, at Yedo, and after his\r\nretirement at Shizuoka (Sumpu). He favored education and encouraged the\r\ndaimyōs to establish schools where the children of their retainers could\r\nbe taught not only military accomplishments but the elements of a good\r\neducation. The Chinese classics were made the essentials of such an\r\neducation, and the chief duty of a school was to teach the pupils to read\r\nand write and understand the works which their venerable and learned\r\nneighbor had furnished them.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         Mixing Ink For Writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this movement in behalf of learning was hampered by the\r\nimpracticable nature of the Chinese written language. Instead of a few\r\ncharacters representing sounds, like European alphabets, it consists of\r\nthousands of symbols, each representing an idea. The pupil must therefore\r\nspend years in learning to make, and know and read the mere signs of\r\nlanguage. And in the modern necessities of printing,(228) the compositor\r\nmust handle not less than 4,000 or 5,000 Chinese characters, besides the\r\nJapanese _kana_ and other needful marks. The _kana_ here mentioned were\r\nthe result of a promising effort which was made to simplify the Chinese\r\nwritten language by expressing it in symbols representing sounds.\r\nForty-seven _kana_ letters—by repetition extended to fifty—each\r\nrepresenting a syllable, are used to express Japanese words.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n Styles Of Letters: (Chinese Proverb: Hiroku koriwo aisuruwo jintoyu. To\r\nlove universally is true humility.) 1. Kaisho (book letters). 2. Ditto. 3.\r\n    Gyosho (script letters). 4. Ditto. 5. Hirasaua (Japanese script).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           Japanese Syllabary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe castle of Yedo was reconstructed and enlarged after the battle of\r\nSekigahara, while Ieyasu continued to reside at Fushimi. The Jesuit\r\nfathers, who accompanied the Father Provincial on his visit to Ieyasu,\r\nassert that 300,000 men were employed in this work. Very much of the\r\nground where the present city of Tōkyō now stands, was then, according to\r\nold maps, covered with water. In excavating the moat which surrounds the\r\ncastle, and the canals connecting this moat with the Sumida-gawa, immense\r\nquantities of earth were obtained, which were used to fill up lagoons and\r\nto reclaim from the shallow bay portions which have now become solid land.\r\nThis work of building the castle and fitting the city for the residence of\r\na great population, was carried on by many of the successors of Ieyasu.\r\nThe third shōgun, Iemitsu, the grandson of Ieyasu, made great improvements\r\nboth to the castle and the city, so that the population and position of\r\nYedo in no long time placed it as the chief city of the empire.(229)\r\n\r\nThe task to which Ieyasu devoted himself during the years of his residence\r\nat Yedo was that of consolidating and settling the feudal system of the\r\nempire. The daimyōs had for centuries been so accustomed to conduct\r\nthemselves independently, and to govern each his own province in his own\r\nway, that they might be expected to resent any efforts to restrict their\r\naction. Fortunately Ieyasu was a mild and temperate man, who, while he\r\ncould act with firmness, was most considerate of the feelings and motives\r\nof others. After the decisive victory of Sekigahara he readily and\r\ncordially made terms with his enemies, and did not show himself rapacious\r\nin exacting from them undue penalties for their hostility. To the daimyō\r\nof Satsuma, as we have already seen, he restored the entire territory\r\nwhich Taikō Sama had given him. The daimyō of Chōshū was allowed to keep\r\ntwo of the provinces out of the ten which he had acquired by conquest, yet\r\nthese two made him still one of the richest and most powerful princes in\r\nthe empire. With others he dealt in the same liberal spirit, so that out\r\nof the old proud daimyōs whom he spared and permitted to continue in their\r\nholdings, he created for himself a body of fast friends.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that the end Ieyasu had in view was to establish\r\na system which should continue loyal to his successors, and to a line of\r\nsuccessors who should be of his own family. Hence out of the confiscated\r\nterritories, and out of those which were in part vacated as a fine on the\r\nformer holders, and out of those which had become vacant by natural\r\ncauses, he carved many fiefs with which he endowed members of his own\r\nfamily and those retainers who were closely affiliated with him. He had\r\ntwelve children,(230) nine sons and three daughters. The daughters were\r\nmarried to three daimyōs. The oldest of his sons, Nobuyasu, had died at an\r\nearly age. His second son, Hideyasu, had been adopted by Taikō Sama, and\r\nto him Ieyasu gave the province of Echizen as his fief. The third son,\r\nHidetada, who shared with his father the command of the forces at the\r\nbattle Sekigahara, had married a daughter of Taikō Sama, and succeeded his\r\nfather as shōgun. On his youngest three sons he bestowed the rich\r\nprovinces of Owari, Kii, and Mito, and constituted the families to which\r\nthey gave rise as the _Go-san-ké_, or the three honorable families. In\r\ncase of a failure in the direct line, the heir to the shōgunate was to be\r\nchosen from one of these families.\r\n\r\nWithout undertaking to give a detailed account of the feudal system as\r\nmodified and established by Ieyasu, it will be sufficient to give the\r\nclasses of daimyōs as they continued to exist under the Tokugawa\r\nshōgunate.(231) It must be understood that feudalism existed in Japan\r\nbefore the time of Ieyasu. It can be traced to the period when Yoritomo\r\nobtained from the emperor permission to send into each province a _shiugo_\r\nwho should be a military man, and should act as protector of the _kokushū_\r\nor governor, who was always a civilian appointed by the emperor. These\r\nmilitary protectors were provided with troops, for the pay of whom\r\nYoritomo got permission from the emperor to levy a tax. Being active men,\r\nand having troops under their command, they gradually absorbed the entire\r\nauthority, and probably in most cases displaced the _kokushū_, who only\r\nrepresented the powerless government at Kyōto. Under the disturbed times\r\nwhich followed the fall of the house of Yoritomo these _shiugo_ became the\r\nhereditary military governors of the provinces, and usurped not only the\r\nfunctions but the name of _kokushū_. They became a class of feudal barons\r\nwho, during the interval when no central authority controlled them,\r\ngoverned each one his own province on his own responsibility. Even after\r\nthe establishment of a central authority, and continuously down to the\r\nabolition of feudalism, the government of the people was in the hands of\r\nthe daimyō of each province. The assessment of taxes, the construction of\r\nroads and bridges, the maintenance of education, the punishment of crime,\r\nthe collection of debts, the enforcement of contracts, and indeed the\r\nwhole circle of what was denominated law were in the hands of the local\r\ngovernment. In truth, in Japan as in other feudal countries there was\r\nscarcely such a thing as law in existence. The customs that prevailed, the\r\ncommon-sense decisions of a magistrate, the final determinations of the\r\ndaimyō, were authoritative in every community. And in all these each\r\nprovince was in a great degree a law unto itself.\r\n\r\nThe classes of daimyōs as arranged and established by Ieyasu were not\r\naltered by his successors, although the number included under each class\r\nwas liable to minor changes. Before Ieyasu’s time there were three classes\r\nof daimyōs, viz.: eighteen _kokushū_, who may be termed lords of\r\nprovinces, thirty-two _ryōshu_ or lords of smaller districts, and two\r\nhundred and twelve _jōshu_ or lords of castles, that is two hundred and\r\nsixty-two in all. The distinction between the first two was one of rank,\r\nbut the third differed from the others in the fact that the assessment in\r\neach case was less than 100,000 _kōku_ of rice. The number of _kokushū_\r\ndaimiates was increased by the addition of Kii and Owari, to which Ieyasu\r\nappointed two of his sons as daimyōs. A third son he appointed daimyō of\r\nMito, which was already of the _kokushū_ rank. He vacated this place by\r\ncompelling the previous holder to accept in place of it another daimiate\r\nof equivalent value.\r\n\r\nIeyasu divided all daimyōs into two distinct classes, the _fudai_ and the\r\n_tozama_. The term _fudai_ was used to designate those who were considered\r\nthe vassals of the Tokugawa family. The _tozama_ daimyōs were those who\r\nwere considered as equal to the vassals of the Tokugawa family, but who\r\nwere not in fact vassals. Of the former there were originally one hundred\r\nand seventy-seven, and of the latter eighty-six.(232) Twenty-one of the\r\n_fudai_ daimyōs were relatives of the shōgun’s family, of whom three, as\r\nhas been stated, were the “honorable families.” All the others, numbering\r\neighteen, bore the name of Matsudaira, one of the family names of Ieyasu,\r\nderived from a small village in the province of Mikawa, where Ieyasu was\r\nborn. This was allowed to them as a special honor.\r\n\r\nWe give here the classification of the daimyōs as enumerated by M.\r\nAppert(233) in his list for the epoch about 1850:\r\n\r\n1. Go-san-ké (three honorable families)                  3\r\n2. Fudai daimyōs (vassals of Tokugawa family)          137\r\n3. Tozama daimyōs (equal to vassals)                    99\r\n4. Kamon (all the other branches of Tokugawa family)    18\r\n5.  Daimyōs, not classified                              6\r\nTotal                                                  263\r\n\r\nThe five leading _tozama_ daimyōs were Kaga, Sendai, Aizu, Chōshū, and\r\nSatsuma, and although they ranked after the _go-san-ké_, they had some\r\nsuperior advantages. They were classed as _kyakubun_, or guests, and\r\nwhenever they paid a visit to the capital of the shōgun, they were met by\r\nenvoys and conducted to their residences.\r\n\r\nBesides these daimyōs of different classes, Ieyasu established an inferior\r\nkind of feudal nobility, which was termed _hatamoto_. This means literally\r\n_under the flag_. They had small holdings assigned to them, and their\r\nincome varied very greatly. Mr. Gubbins, in his paper, puts the number at\r\nabout 2,000. It was the custom to employ the members of this minor class\r\nof aristocracy very largely in filling the official positions in the\r\nshōgun’s government. Indeed, it was held as a common maxim, that the\r\noffices should be filled by poor men rather than by rich.(234) The\r\n_gokenin_, numbering about 5,000, were still another class who were\r\ninferior to the _hatamoto_. They had small incomes, and were mostly\r\nemployed in subordinate positions. Beneath these again stood the ordinary\r\nfighting men, or common _samurai_, who were the retainers of the daimyōs\r\nand of the shōgun. They were the descendants of the soldiers of the time\r\nof Yoritomo, who appointed _shiugo_ to reside with a company of troops in\r\neach province, for the purpose of keeping the peace. They had already\r\ngrown to claim a great superiority over the common people, and Ieyasu\r\nencouraged them in this feeling of superciliousness. The people were\r\ndivided into four classes, arranged in the following order: _samurai_,\r\nfarmers, artisans, and merchants. And in his _Legacy_ Ieyasu thus\r\nexpresses himself(235): “The _samurai_ are masters of the four classes.\r\nFarmers, artisans, and merchants may not behave in a rude manner towards\r\n_samurai_ ... and a _samurai_ is not to be interfered with in cutting down\r\na fellow who has behaved to him in a manner other than is expected.” Again\r\nhe says(236): “A girded sword is the living soul of a _samurai_.”\r\n\r\nThe authority coming from so high and so revered a source did not grow\r\nless during the centuries of feudalism which followed. The _samurai_ did\r\nnot fail to use all the privileges which were allowed them by Ieyasu’s\r\ntestamentary law. Especially in the large cities where great numbers of\r\nthem were gathered, and where idleness led them into endless evil\r\npractices, the arrogance and overbearing pride of the _samurai_ made them\r\nan intolerable nuisance. Nevertheless it must be allowed that nearly all\r\nthat was good, and high-minded, and scholarly in Japan was to be found\r\namong the ranks of the feudal retainers. It is to them that the credit\r\nmust be given of the great changes and improvements which have been\r\ninitiated since Japan was opened up to foreigners. They were the students\r\nwho went out into the world to learn what western science had to teach\r\nthem. They have been pioneers in a return to a central authority and to\r\nthe experiment of a representative government, and to the principles of\r\nfreedom and toleration to which the country is committed. To them Japan\r\nowes its ancient as well as its modern system of education. Its old stores\r\nof literature, it is true, are not due to them, but surely all its modern\r\ndevelopment in newspapers, magazines, history, political science, and\r\nlegal and commercial codes, is to be traced to the adaptability and energy\r\nof the old _samurai_ class.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                               Sword-Maker.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _samurai_ had the privilege of carrying two swords; the principal one\r\n(_katana_) was about four feet long, nearly straight, but slightly curved\r\ntoward the point, the blade thick and ground to a keen though blunt edge.\r\nIt was carried in a scabbard thrust through the _obi_ or belt on the left\r\nside, with the edge uppermost. Besides the _katana_ the _samurai_ carried\r\nalso a short sword about nine and a half inches long, called _wakizashi_.\r\nThe blade of the sword was fastened to the hilt by a pin of wood and could\r\nbe readily detached. On the part of the blade inserted in the hilt, the\r\nmaker’s name was always inscribed, and it was a special matter of pride\r\nwhen he was one of the famous sword-smiths of Japan. The most noted makers\r\nwere Munechika, Masamune, Yoshimitsu, and Muramasa, who ranged from the\r\ntenth down through the fourteenth century. The quality of the Japanese\r\nsword has been a matter of national pride, and the feats which have been\r\naccomplished by it seem almost beyond belief. To cleave at one blow three\r\nhuman bodies laid one upon another; to cut through a pile of copper coins\r\nwithout nicking the edge, were common tests which were often tried.(237)\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                      Sword, Spears, And Matchlock.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an essential part of the education of a young _samurai_ that he\r\nshould be trained thoroughly in martial exercises. The latter part of\r\nevery school day was given up to this kind of physical training. He was\r\ntaught to ride a horse, to shoot with the bow, to handle the spear, and\r\nespecially to be skilled in the etiquette and use of the sword.(238) They\r\nwent through again and again the tragic details of the commission of\r\n_hara-kiri_, and had it impressed on their youthful imaginations with such\r\nforce and vividness, that when the time for its actual enactment came they\r\nwere able to meet the bloody reality without a tremor and with perfect\r\ncomposure.(239)\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the relations between the feudal chiefs and their\r\nretainers lay in the doctrine of Confucius. The principles which he lays\r\ndown fitted in admirably to the ideas which the historical system of\r\nJapanese feudalism had made familiar. They inculcated absolute submission\r\nof the son to the father, of the wife to her husband, and of the servant\r\nto his master, and in these respects Japanese feudalism was a willing and\r\nzealous disciple. On these lines Ieyasu constructed his plans of\r\ngovernment, and his successors enthusiastically followed in his footsteps.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          Daibutsu At Kamakura.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn religious belief the nation by the time of Ieyasu was largely\r\nBuddhistic. Through ten centuries and a half the active propagation of\r\nthis faith had been going on, until now by far the greater number of the\r\npopulation were Buddhists. In his _Legacy_ Ieyasu expresses a desire to\r\ntolerate all religious sects except the Christian. He says: “High and low\r\nalike may follow their own inclinations with respect to religious tenets\r\nwhich have obtained down to the present time, except as regards the false\r\nand corrupt school (Christianity). Religious disputes have ever proved the\r\nbane and misfortune of the empire, and should determinedly be put a stop\r\nto.”(240)\r\n\r\nWhile he was therefore tolerant towards all the different sects of\r\nBuddhism and towards the old Shintō faith of the country, he particularly\r\npatronized the Jōdo sect to which his ancestors had been attached, and to\r\nwhich he charges his posterity to remain faithful.(241) In the archives of\r\nthe Buddhist temple Zōjōji at Shiba in Tōkyō was preserved an account\r\nwritten by the head priest of the time, how Ieyasu, in 1590, visited the\r\ntemple and took it under his patronage, saying,(242) “For a general to be\r\nwithout an ancestral temple of his own is as though he were forgetful of\r\nthe fact that he must die.... I have now come to beg of you to let me make\r\nthis my ancestral temple here.” So that from the time of Ieyasu the Jōdo\r\nwas the authorized sect to which the court of the shōguns was especially\r\nattached, and to this is to be attributed the fact that its temples and\r\nmonasteries in Tōkyō have always been of the most majestic and gorgeous\r\ncharacter.(243)\r\n\r\nIeyasu did not long hold the office of shōgun, which the emperor had\r\nconferred upon him in 1603. It is not easy to understand why a man, who\r\nwas only sixty-three years of age and who was still in vigorous health,\r\nshould wish to throw off the responsibilities of office and retire to\r\nprivate life. We must remember, however, that it was the custom of his\r\ncountry, consecrated by the usage of the imperial house and of the shōguns\r\nand regents who had preceded him. Morever, though he surrendered to his\r\nson the title of shōgun, he retained in his own hands a large part of the\r\npower which he had hitherto exercised.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that he was anxious to establish the succession of the\r\nshōgunate unquestionably in his own family. For this purpose he deemed it\r\nwise to initiate a successor while he still had the influence and the\r\npower to compel the acquiescence of the feudal lords of the empire. Acting\r\nupon these considerations Ieyasu, in 1605, retired in favor of his third\r\nson Hidetada. He received from the emperor the title of\r\n_sei-i-tai-shōgun_, which his father had held. Ieyasu took up his\r\nresidence at Sumpu(244) (now Shizuoka), which was situated on Suruga bay,\r\none hundred and fourteen miles from the shōgun’s capital. Here he\r\nmaintained a court and practically in all important matters governed the\r\ncountry. He was free, however, from the petty details of the\r\nadministration, and devoted himself as an amateur to a literary life, to\r\nthe collection and printing of books, and to the encouragement and\r\npatronage of literary men, in which he delighted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime important events had been taking place which had great\r\ninfluence on the history of Japan. The contest between the Spanish on the\r\none hand, and the Dutch and English on the other, was not confined to the\r\nAtlantic, but broke out in the Pacific, where the Portuguese and Spaniards\r\nhad so long been predominant. A preliminary to the opening of trade with\r\nthe Dutch were the arrival of William Adams and his extraordinary\r\nexperiences in Japan. As we learn from his own letters,(245) he was born\r\nnear Rochester in England, 1574, and when twelve years old was apprenticed\r\nto Nicholas Diggins as a pilot. With him he served for twelve years, then\r\ntook service as pilot major of a fleet of five sail, which was about to be\r\ndespatched by the “Indish Companie” to take part in the trade of the East\r\nIndies. This fleet had a rough time, and with fevers and scurvy and want\r\nof food a great part of the crews of the five vessels died. They sailed by\r\nthe way of the straits of Magellan, then northward past Chili, and\r\nwestward across the broad Pacific. Two of the ships turned back at the\r\nstraits and returned to Holland. A third vessel was captured by the\r\nSpaniards, and the pinnace of a fourth was seized by eight men, and run\r\ninto some island on their way, supposed to be one of the Sandwich Islands,\r\nand there wrecked, and the eight men probably eaten. The two vessels still\r\nremaining were the _Hope_ and the _Charity_. The former of these was never\r\nmore heard of. The sole remaining vessel was the _Charity_, of which\r\nJaques Maihore was the master, and William Adams was the pilot. Sickness,\r\nespecially the scurvy, which was the frightful scourge on board the\r\nvessels of that day, had reduced the crew, so that only four were able to\r\nwalk, of whom Adams was one, and four more could creep on their knees.\r\n\r\nIn this condition they reached, on the eleventh of April, 1600, the\r\nnortheastern coast of the island of Kyūshū, landing in the province of\r\nBungo, whose prince in earlier days had been the friend and patron of the\r\nPortuguese Jesuits. They were kindly received, the governor of the\r\ndistrict furnishing a guard to protect their property—too late however for\r\nthe preservation of much of it—and a house in which the sick could be\r\ncared for. In a few days a Portuguese Jesuit and other Portuguese arrived\r\nfrom Nagasaki, through whom the Dutch could communicate with the natives.\r\nThe national and religious animosity between the strangers and their\r\ninterpreters could not fail, however, to manifest itself. The Portuguese\r\ntried to create the impression that the refugees were pirates and unworthy\r\nof protection and help.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the usual custom, word was immediately sent to Ieyasu\r\n(whom Adams calls the emperor), who at this time was at the castle of\r\nŌsaka. He sent boats to Bungo, by which Adams and one of the crew were\r\nconveyed to his castle. Adams gives an interesting account of his\r\nreception, of the questions asked concerning his country, and its\r\nrelations to the Spanish and Portuguese. He took occasion to explain, that\r\nthe object of the Dutch in entering the East was purely that of trade,\r\nthat they had in their own country many commodities which they would be\r\nglad to exchange for the products of the eastern nations.\r\n\r\nAfter this interview Adams was kept thirty-nine days in prison, expecting\r\nto suffer the punishment of crucifixion, which he understood was the\r\ncommon mode of disposing of such characters. He found afterwards that the\r\nPortuguese had been using means to poison the mind of Ieyasu by\r\nrepresenting them as dangerous characters, and recommending that all the\r\nrefugees should be put to death as a warning to others. But he tells\r\nus(246) that Ieyasu answered them, that “we as yet had done to him nor to\r\nnone of his lands any harm or dammage [and it was] against Reason and\r\nJustice to put us to death. If our countreys had warres the one with the\r\nother, that was no cause that he should put us to death.”\r\n\r\nWhile Adams was thus kept in prison, the _Charity_ had been brought to\r\nSakai, near to Ōsaka. Finally he was set at liberty, and suffered to\r\nrevisit his ship, where he found the captain and remnant of the crew. The\r\ngoods and clothing on board had been stolen by the natives, which Ieyasu\r\ntried to recover for them. But everything had been so scattered that it\r\nwas impossible to regain it, “savinge 50,000 Rs in reddy money was\r\ncommanded to be geven us” [as compensation]. After this settlement they\r\nwere ordered to sail with their ship to the “land of Quanto and neere to\r\nthe citie Eddo,” whither Ieyasu was about to proceed by land. Here they\r\nhad a mutiny among their men, which ended in the entire disbanding of the\r\ncrew, and the dividing up among them the money which they had received for\r\ntheir goods. Each man was left to shift for himself. The captain got\r\npermission to sail in a Japanese junk to Patan, where he hoped to meet\r\nDutch vessels.\r\n\r\nAdams himself was kept about the shōgun’s court, and was made useful in\r\nvarious ways. His first achievement was to build a vessel of about\r\neighteen tons burthen, which gained him great favor, in which he made\r\nseveral short voyages. Then in 1609, by command of the shōgun, he built\r\nanother ship of one hundred and twenty tons burthen, which also was a\r\nsuccessful venture. For it so happened that the governor of Manila was on\r\nhis way to Nova Spania(247) in a large ship of one thousand tons burthen,\r\nand was wrecked on the east coast of Japan, in the province of Shimosa.\r\nThe governor and those of his comrades who were saved from the shipwreck\r\nwere sent on to Acapulco in the ship which Adams had just built. In the\r\nyear following, the governor, in recognition of their kindness to him,\r\nsent back to the Japanese government a much larger vessel as a present,\r\nthe original being sent to and retained at Manila.\r\n\r\nAdams was a straightforward, honest fellow, and commended himself to\r\nIeyasu by usefulness not only in such matters as building ships, but in\r\nfurnishing information concerning foreign affairs, which at this time were\r\npressing on the government. In order to render him more content, Ieyasu\r\ngave him a small holding at Hemi, near the present town of Yokosuka, a few\r\nhours’ sail from Yedo. He himself speaks of this property as “a living\r\nlike unto a lordship in England, with eighty or ninety husbandmen, that be\r\nas my slaves or servants.”(248) He probably also had a residence in Yedo,\r\nfor there is to this day a street called _An-jin-chō_, or Pilot Street,\r\nnear Nihonbashi, which is popularly believed to have been the street in\r\nwhich Adams lived. He himself says that he was known among the Japanese as\r\n“An-gin Sama,” or Mr. Pilot. To console himself for the loss of his wife\r\nand children left in England, he married a Japanese wife, who, with\r\nseveral children, is mentioned by Captain Cocks in the visit above\r\nreferred to. Notwithstanding his frequent endeavors to get back to\r\nEngland, he was never able to return, but after much important service\r\nboth to the Dutch and English, to which we shall refer below, he died May\r\n6, 1620.(249)\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of the Dutch after Adams’ shipwreck, as above\r\ndescribed, was in 1609, when the _Red Lion_ and the yacht _Griffon_\r\narrived at Hirado. They were well received by the daimyō, and a deputation\r\nwas sent to Yedo to visit the shōgun. Adams, in his second letter, speaks\r\nof their being “received in great friendship, making conditions with the\r\nemperor (shōgun) yearly to send a ship or two.” They were given a letter\r\naddressed to the “King of Holland,” with which they went back, arriving\r\nhome July, 1610. This letter, among other things, promises, “that they\r\n(your subjects), in all places, countries, and islands under mine\r\nobedience, may traffic and build homes serviceable and needful for their\r\ntrade and merchandises, where they may trade without any hindrance at\r\ntheir pleasure, as well in time to come as for the present, so that no man\r\nshall do them any wrong. And I will maintain and defend them as mine own\r\nsubjects.”(250)\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this agreement the first vessel to arrive was a small\r\nyacht in July, 1611. A deputation from this vessel also went to visit the\r\nshōgun and the retired shōgun. It so chanced that a Portuguese party had\r\npreceded them by a few days. These deputations met at the court of Ieyasu.\r\nBy the assistance of Adams, who was ready to do a favor to his old\r\nfriends, the Dutch were kindly welcomed by the ex-shōgun’s court, and in\r\nspite of the hostility, or perhaps aided by the hostility, of the\r\nPortuguese, they received from him a patent for continued trade. As given\r\nin Kaempfer in translation it is as follows:\r\n\r\n“All Dutch ships that come into my empire of Japan, whatever place or port\r\nthey may put into, we do hereby expressly command all and every one of our\r\nsubjects not to molest the same in any way, nor to be a hindrance to them;\r\nbut, on the contrary, to show them all manner of help, favor and\r\nassistance. Every one shall beware to maintain the friendship, in\r\nassurance of which we have been pleased to give our imperial word to these\r\npeople; and every one shall take care that our commands and promises be\r\ninviolably kept.\r\n\r\n“Dated (in Japanese equivalent to) August 30, 1611.”(251)\r\n\r\nThis was the authority on which the Dutch trade in Japan began, and under\r\nwhich, with many changes and vicissitudes, it continued to the time when\r\nthe country was opened by treaty to foreign nations.\r\n\r\nThe effort made by English merchants to open a trade with the Japanese was\r\nmade only a little after this time. Indeed, it is said that the report\r\nbrought back by the Dutch in the _Red Lion_ concerning Adams’ presence and\r\ninfluence in Japan, gave the impulse which started an expedition under\r\nCaptain John Saris in January, 1611. Saris was an old adventurer in the\r\nEast, and therefore fitted to encounter the varied experiences of his\r\nproposed trip. He carried a letter from James I., then king of England, to\r\nIeyasu the retired shōgun. At Bantam on his way he found that Adams’ first\r\nletter,(252) contained in the collection of his letters, and dated October\r\n22, 1611, had just been received by the English merchants. It encouraged\r\nSaris to push on in his expedition. He arrived at Hirado, June, 1613,\r\nwhere the daimyō welcomed him and immediately sent off a special messenger\r\nto the shōgun’s court to summon Adams to their aid. He came at once, and\r\nby his advice Captain Saris with a party set out to pay his respects to\r\nthe retired shōgun. He gives an interesting account(253) of this journey\r\nand visit, which resulted in a charter of privileges(254) for the London\r\nEast India Company to trade in any port of the empire. Having arranged to\r\nhis great satisfaction this important matter he returned to Hirado, where\r\nhe established a factory to serve as the basis for future English trade.\r\nIn this, however, he encountered no little opposition from the Dutch\r\ntraders, who had a factory in the same place. For while these enterprising\r\nnations, who had been allies in the days of the Armada, could combine very\r\nreadily in opposition to the Spanish and Portuguese, it was not easy for\r\neither of them to look on complacently while the other secured for itself\r\nsuperior advantages in the matter of trade. Captain Saris tried to come to\r\nsome agreement with his rivals, so that the prices of commodities might be\r\nkept up, but he was compelled to see the Dutch factory, in order to crowd\r\nhim out of the field, putting the goods which they had for sale at prices\r\nwhich were ruinous to both. Having established matters, however, on as\r\nsatisfactory a footing as he could arrange, and having left his comrade,\r\nCaptain Cocks, in charge of the English factory, he sailed for home.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent events in the history of English trade with Japan may as\r\nwell be traced here. The relations of the English and Dutch in the East\r\ngrew steadily more inimical. Perhaps this was due to the increasing\r\nrivalry in trade and navigation which prevailed between them at home. In\r\n1617 the London East India Company fitted out an expedition of five large\r\nvessels. This fleet arrived in the East in the summer of the following\r\nyear. After much hostile skirmishing in which the Dutch obtained the\r\npermanent advantage, and the English commander was about to retire, word\r\nwas brought to them from Europe that a peace had been arranged between the\r\ntwo countries. The English and Dutch vessels accordingly sailed to Japan,\r\nwhere they took a hand at trade; because in those days ships always were\r\nsent to the East prepared either to fight or trade as the case required.\r\nBut this amicable arrangement did not last many years. The massacre at the\r\nSpice Islands in 1623, for which Cromwell afterward exacted an indemnity,\r\nended all attempts at co-operation in the East. Soon after this the\r\nEnglish company withdrew entirely from the Japanese trade, having lost in\r\nthe effort forty thousand pounds. The Dutch were thus left without a\r\nrival, and we shall see on what conditions and at what sacrifices they\r\ncontinued to maintain their monopoly.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Ieyasu’s retirement, which lasted from 1605 until his\r\ndeath in 1616, he devoted himself, as we have seen, to the consolidation\r\nof his family dynasty and to such literary occupations as his leisure\r\nallowed. He was a patron of the art derived from Korea, which then was\r\npopular in Japan, of printing with movable types.(255) This art fell into\r\ndisuse afterwards, but during Ieyasu’s retirement in Sumpu he interested\r\nhimself in printing with blocks as well as by the new method. When he died\r\nhe was engaged in seeing through the press an edition of an important\r\nChinese work.\r\n\r\nHe left behind him a document, called the _Legacy of Ieyasu_, which to\r\nthose desirous of studying the character and motives of the founder of the\r\nTokugawa dynasty possesses a supreme interest. Some doubt has been thrown\r\nby Japanese critics on the authenticity of this composition. It has been\r\nasserted that it was not the work of Ieyasu and therefore not worthy of\r\nthe reverence in which it has been held. But whether the _Legacy_(256) was\r\noriginally composed by him or approved and sanctioned by him, matters\r\nlittle for our purpose. It dates from the time of the founding of the\r\nTokugawa shōgunate, and has been an unimpeachable authority during all its\r\nhistory. One of the singular features in the disposition of the _Legacy_,\r\nto which Professor Grigsby directs attention, was the secrecy in which it\r\nwas kept. The original was preserved in Kyōto and was never seen, while an\r\nauthenticated copy was kept at the shōgun’s court in Yedo, and once a year\r\nwas open to the inspection of all above a certain rank. To us it seems\r\nunaccountable that a body of so-called laws, by which the conduct of men\r\nwas to be guided, should be kept secret from them. But it must be\r\nremembered that in those days there were no such things as laws in the\r\nsense we now understand the term. There were magistrates who heard causes\r\nand complaints, but their decisions were based not on laws which had been\r\nenacted by the government, but upon prevailing custom and upon the innate\r\nsense of justice which was assumed to be present in the mind of every man.\r\nWhatever laws or rules therefore were in existence were not for the\r\ninformation of the people, but for the guidance of the magistrates.\r\n\r\nThe _Legacy of Ieyasu_ consists of one hundred chapters, arranged without\r\nany attempt at logical order. Each chapter treats of a single, separate\r\nsubject, and is usually of a very moderate length. As Professor Grigsby\r\nhas pointed out: “Sixteen chapters consist of moral maxims and\r\nreflections; fifty-five are connected with politics and administrations;\r\ntwenty-two refer to legal matters, and in seven Ieyasu relates episodes of\r\nhis own personal history.” The moral maxims are quoted chiefly from the\r\nworks of the Chinese sages, Confucius and Mencius. While the collection on\r\nthe whole has a military aspect, and plainly encourages and promotes the\r\nwell-being of a military class, yet we see in it the mild and peaceful\r\nnature of Ieyasu. The fifteenth chapter says: “In my youth my sole aim was\r\nto conquer and subjugate inimical provinces and to take revenge on the\r\nenemies of my ancestors. Yuyō teaches, however, that ‘to assist the people\r\nis to give peace to the empire,’ and since I have come to understand that\r\nthe precept is founded on sound principle, I have undeviatingly followed\r\nit. Let my posterity hold fast this principle. Any one turning his back\r\nupon it is no descendant of mine. The people are the foundation of the\r\nempire.”\r\n\r\nHis estimate of the social relations is given in the forty-sixth chapter,\r\nin which he says: “The married state is the great relation of mankind. One\r\nshould not live alone after sixteen years of age, but should procure a\r\nmediator and perform the ceremony of matrimonial alliance. The same\r\nkindred, however, may not intermarry. A family of good descent should be\r\nchosen to marry into; for when a line of descendants is prolonged, the\r\nforeheads of ancestors expand. All mankind recognize marriage as the first\r\nlaw of nature.”\r\n\r\nThe old custom of servants and retainers following their masters to death,\r\nand committing suicide in order to accompany them, is referred to in the\r\nseventy-fifth chapter.(257) It is not improbable that some exhibition of\r\nthis custom occasionally was seen in the days of Ieyasu, for he very\r\nsternly condemns it thus: “Although it is undoubtedly an ancient custom\r\nfor a vassal to follow his lord to death, there is not the slightest\r\nreason in the practice.... These practices are strictly forbidden, more\r\nespecially to primary retainers, and also to secondary retainers even to\r\nthe lowest. He is the opposite of a faithful servant who disregards this\r\nprohibition; his posterity shall be impoverished by the confiscation of\r\nhis property, as a warning to those who disobey the laws.”(258)\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to follow in detail the line of Tokugawa shōguns. Few\r\nof them impressed themselves in any marked manner on the history of their\r\ncountry. Iemitsu, the third shōgun, who was a grandson of Ieyasu, was a\r\nman of great ability, and left many marks of his talents upon the empire.\r\nUnder his administration the capital made great advances. He bound the\r\ndaimyōs to his house by requiring them to maintain residences in Yedo\r\nunder the surveillance of the government. His mausoleum is placed with\r\nthat of his grandfather amid the august glories of Nikkō. Tsunayoshi\r\n(1681-1709) during his incumbency was more than usually interested in the\r\npeaceful prosperity of his country, and is gratefully remembered for his\r\npatronage of education and letters. But on the whole they were content to\r\nfill the office of shōgun in a perfunctory manner, and to leave to\r\nsubordinates the duty of governing.\r\n\r\nJapan reached the acme of her ancient greatness during the Tokugawa\r\ndynasty. The arts which have given her such a deservedly high rank\r\nattained their greatest perfection. Keramics and lacquer, which are her\r\nmost exquisite arts, achieved a degree of excellence to which we can now\r\nonly look back with hopeless admiration. Metal-work, as shown in the\r\nmanufacture of bronze and in the forging and mounting of swords, was\r\nscarcely less notable. The still higher art of painting, which came to\r\nJapan from China, rose during the Tokugawa period to the rank which it\r\nstill holds in the estimation of the artistic world.\r\n\r\nThe best evidence, however, of the civilization of a people is found in\r\ntheir social condition. To learn the true culture of a nation it is\r\nnecessary to study their education and literature, their laws and system\r\nof government, and their morals and religion. In some of these particulars\r\nit is still difficult to obtain an adequate knowledge of Japan. But\r\ngradually they are being revealed to us. The laws and legal\r\nprecedents(259) which prevailed during the Tokugawa period have been\r\nunearthed from the archives of the Department of Justice and are being\r\npublished in the _Transactions of the Asiatic Society_.\r\n\r\nThe medical and scientific advancement of Japan in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries was not co-ordinate with her progress in the arts.\r\nThey were hampered with the old Chinese notions about a male principle and\r\na female principle which were conceived to prevail in nature, and with the\r\nfive elements to which the human organs were supposed to correspond.\r\nFortunately nature has ways of healing diseases in spite of theories and\r\ndrugs. To this benign principle must be assigned the fact that the human\r\nrace has survived the surgery and medicaments of mediæval Europe as well\r\nas mediæval China and Japan. In one particular the medical art of Japan\r\nseems to have been differently, perhaps better, conducted than in Europe.\r\nIt is narrated by the Japanese annalists,(260) that if a physican made a\r\nmistake in his prescription or in his directions for taking the medicine\r\nhe was punished by three years’ imprisonment and a heavy fine; and if\r\nthere should be any impurity in the medicine prescribed or any mistake in\r\nthe preparation, sixty lashes were inflicted besides a heavy fine.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          Oban. Gold Coin, 1727.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree peculiar modes of medical practice deserve notice. The first was\r\nacupuncture, which consisted in inserting a thin needle through the skin\r\ninto the muscles beneath. A second was the cauterization by _moxa_(261)\r\n(Japanese _mogusa_). This was effected by placing over the spot a small\r\nconical wad of the fibrous blossoms of mugwort (_Artemisia vulgaris\r\nlatifolia_). The cone was kindled at the top and slowly burned till it was\r\nconsumed. A painful blister was produced on the spot, which was believed\r\nto have a wholesome effect in the case of many complaints. A third mode of\r\ntreatment is the practice of _massage_ (_amma_), which western nations\r\nhave borrowed, and which in Japan it has long been the exclusive privilege\r\nof the blind to apply.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          Cauterizing With Moxa.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the improved notions of western medicine were introduced by the\r\nDutch, and this accounts for the unprecedentedly rapid advance which this\r\nscience has made since the opening of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. COMMODORE PERRY AND WHAT FOLLOWED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most potent cause which led to the breaking down of the Tokugawa\r\nShōgunate, was the attitude which the empire had assumed toward foreign\r\nnations. There were other causes which co-operated with this, but none\r\nwhich were capable of such far-reaching and revolutionary effects. We have\r\nseen that this attitude was due to the fears entertained concerning the\r\ndesigns of the Portuguese and the Spanish. These fears may have been\r\nunfounded, but they were none the less real and operative. Such fears may\r\nhave been stimulated by the Dutch, who had no reason to deal tenderly with\r\nthe fanatical enemies of the independence and religion of their country.\r\nThe spirit of trade with large profits was at the bottom of the great\r\nenterprises which were sent out from Europe to the East and West Indies\r\nduring the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe rivalry between the Dutch and Portuguese resulted in the banishment of\r\nthe latter, and the establishment of the Dutch at Nagasaki in 1640. They\r\noccupied the little artificial island of Deshima, about three acres in\r\nextent, where were erected their houses, their offices and stores, and\r\nwhere for more than two hundred years their trade was conducted. And this,\r\ntogether with a like limited arrangement with the Chinese, was the sole\r\nforeign intercourse allowed with Japan.\r\n\r\nIt is plain now that this seclusion was a great mistake. It would have\r\nbeen of inestimable value to this enterprising and progressive people, to\r\nhave kept in the race for improvement with the other nations of the world.\r\nThey would not at this late day be compelled, under a dreadful strain of\r\nresources, to provide themselves with the modern appliances of\r\ncivilization. Long since they would have tried the experiments with which\r\nthey are now engaged, and would have found a way through the intricacies\r\nof politics to a free and stable government. To Ieyasu and his successors\r\nthe way of safety seemed to be, to shut themselves up and sternly deny\r\nadmittance to the outside world, while they continued to work out their\r\ndestiny in their own way.\r\n\r\nWith whatever shortcomings the Dutch are to be charged in their\r\nintercourse with Japan, the world owes a great debt of gratitude to them\r\nfor what they accomplished. Whatever was known concerning Japanese history\r\nand civilization down to the times of Commodore Perry, came chiefly from\r\nthe Dutch. And not less than the debt of the rest of the world is that of\r\nJapan herself. Although the influence of the government was always exerted\r\nagainst the admission of foreign ideas, not a few of the seeds of western\r\ncivilization were by them planted in a fertile soil and bore abundant\r\nfruit. To Kaempfer and Baron von Siebold particularly we must always look\r\nfor our knowledge of the Japan of the days of its seclusion. Many efforts\r\nwere made at successive times to open intercourse by the representatives\r\nof different nations. The Russians were the most persistent, and their\r\nattempts did not cease until the imprisonment of Captain Galowin in 1811.\r\nIn comparatively recent times numerous essays were made resulting in\r\ndisappointment. The American brig _Morrison_ in 1837, the British\r\nsurveying ship _Saramang_ in 1845, Captain Cooper in 1845, Commodore\r\nBiddle in 1848, Admiral Cecille in 1848, Commander Glynn in 1849, and\r\nCommander Matheson in the same year, all made efforts to communicate with\r\nthe government, but were rebuffed. It is plain that affairs were rapidly\r\nverging towards a point when the isolation of Japan must be given up.\r\n\r\nSeveral causes contributed to the creation of a special interest in the\r\nUnited States of America, concerning the opening of negotiations with\r\nJapan. One of these was the magnitude to which the whale fishery had\r\nattained, and the large financial investments(262) held in this industry\r\nby American citizens. A second cause was the opening of China to foreign\r\ntrade as a result of the opium war. But the most active cause was the\r\ndiscovery of gold in California in 1848, and the consequent development of\r\nthat state as a centre of trade. It was an early scheme to run a line of\r\nsteamers from San Francisco to the newly opened ports of China. To\r\nHongkong the distance is about 6,149 nautical miles, and if a steamer is\r\nto traverse the whole distance without a break, she must carry an enormous\r\nload of coal. The only remedy lay in establishing a coaling station on the\r\nJapanese islands, and this could only be effected when Japan abandoned her\r\npolicy of seclusion and entered with a free heart into the comity of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the government and people of the United States at last\r\neventuated in the expedition under Commodore Matthew C. Perry. He had for\r\na long time been convinced of the importance and feasibility of such an\r\nundertaking, and when he was summoned to take charge of it he made the\r\nmost thorough preparation for his task.\r\n\r\nAt his suggestion the government procured all available books, maps, and\r\ncharts, and he made himself master of every conceivable detail. From\r\nmanufacturing establishments he secured models of railways, telegraphic\r\nlines, and other interesting industrial equipments. He realized the\r\nnecessity of taking with him such a naval force that its appearance in\r\nJapanese waters would produce a profound impression upon the government.\r\nAnd knowing that all his predecessors, who had sought access by way of\r\nNagasaki, had been repelled, he resolved to avoid it and its Portuguese\r\nand Dutch traditions and venture boldly into the bay of Yedo.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was known that a diplomatic expedition was to be despatched\r\nto Japan under the command of Commodore Perry he was deluged with\r\napplications, both from England and America, to be permitted to join it.\r\n\r\nBut Perry resolutely declined all these enterprising offers. In his long\r\ncareer as a naval officer he had seen the danger of admitting on board\r\nmen-of-war persons who were not under the authority of the commander. From\r\nsuch dangers he meant to be free. He therefore refused to take on board\r\nthe ships of his squadron any but regularly accredited officers and men\r\nover whom he exercised legitimate control. He even made it a rule that if\r\nany of the officers kept diaries during the progress of the expedition,\r\nthey should be the property of the Navy Department and could not be\r\npublished without its permission and authority.\r\n\r\nCommodore Perry carried with him a friendly letter from the President of\r\nthe United States to the Emperor of Japan,(263) who is therein addressed\r\nas “Great and Good Friend.” The letter pointed out the contiguity of the\r\ntwo countries and the importance of their friendship and commercial\r\nintercourse; it announced that Commodore Perry had been sent to give\r\nassurance of the friendly sentiment of the President, and to arrange for\r\nprivileges of trade, for the care of shipwrecked sailors, and for the\r\nappointment of a convenient port where coal and other supplies might be\r\nobtained by the vessels of the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter some provoking delays and disappointments the expedition sailed from\r\nNorfolk on the 24th of November, 1852,(264) proceeding by the way of the\r\ncape of Good Hope to the China sea. There taking on board Dr. S. Wells\r\nWilliams as interpreter, and visiting several ports in China, the Bonin\r\nislands, and the Ryūkyū islands, they sailed to Japan. The squadron, led\r\nby the _Susquehanna_ and followed by the _Mississippi_, the _Plymouth_,\r\nand the _Saratoga_, entered Yedo bay, July 8, 1853.(265)\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          Commodore M. C. Perry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese government had been warned of the preparation and coming of\r\nthis expedition by the Dutch. Eager to maintain their position with the\r\ngovernment the King of the Netherlands addressed to the Shōgun a letter in\r\n1844 suggesting the relaxation of the laws excluding foreign nations from\r\ntrade. But in the following year he received an answer declining to make\r\nany changes.\r\n\r\nWith all the warning, however, which the government had received and the\r\npreparations which had been made for the momentous occasion, the\r\nappearance of the squadron at the entrance of Yedo bay was an intense\r\nsurprise. Two large steam frigates—the _Susquehanna_ and the\r\n_Mississippi_—and two sloops-of-war—the _Plymouth_ and the\r\n_Saratoga_,—although much inferior to the squadron promised, composed such\r\nan array as had never before made its appearance in Yedo bay. As they\r\nplowed through the peaceful waters, in full view of the white-capped peak\r\nof Fuji-yama, every height and vantage ground along the shore seemed alive\r\nwith troops and with wondering and alarmed inhabitants. The vessels came\r\nto anchor off the village of Uraga, which is not far from the present site\r\nof the dockyards at Yokosuka.\r\n\r\nThe account(266) of the preliminary negotiations conducted by Commodore\r\nPerry with the officers of the government is interesting, as showing the\r\nefforts made by them to send him to Nagasaki, and his absolute refusal to\r\ngo thither or conduct his business through the Dutch or Chinese. When\r\nthere seemed no other way, consent was given to receive, through an\r\nofficer of adequate rank, the letter from the President of the United\r\nStates to the Emperor of Japan. When he had formally delivered this\r\nletter, he took his departure with an intimation that he would return at a\r\nfuture day and receive the answer.(267)\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the display of force which Commodore Perry took\r\ncare to make in all his transactions with the Japanese officials at the\r\nsame time that he was careful to convey assurances of his friendly\r\npurposes and objects, produced a deep impression on the government with\r\nwhich he had to deal. It is useless to deny that it was on this display of\r\nforce that Commodore Perry largely relied for the success of his\r\nexpedition. That he was prepared to use force had it been necessary we may\r\nfeel sure.(268) But the instructions of his government and his own sense\r\nof international justice bound him to exhaust every peaceful resource\r\nbefore resorting to measures of coercion.\r\n\r\nThe government of the shōgun was greatly troubled by this responsibility\r\nso suddenly laid upon it. They knew not what would be the result of their\r\nrefusal to enter upon negotiations when Perry returned. The seclusion in\r\nwhich they had kept themselves so long had cut them off from a knowledge\r\nof the relations in which the nations of the world stood to each other.\r\nNotwithstanding Commodore Perry’s protestations of friendliness, they were\r\nafraid of his great ships and their powerful armaments. Should they, as\r\nthey might easily do, make their way up the bay till they were within\r\ngunshot of the capital, what resistance could the government show, or how\r\ncould it prevent them from battering down the castle and all the daimyōs’\r\nresidences.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of loyalty to the emperor and opposition to the shōgun,\r\nwhich had been growing up so insidiously and had now become really\r\nformidable, was a source of the greatest perplexity to the Yedo\r\ngovernment. Should they proceed with their negotiations and make a treaty\r\nwith the Americans, this anti-shōgun sentiment was ready to manifest\r\nitself against them with terrible effect. If they refused to negotiate,\r\nthen they must be ready to meet the invaders of their soil with their\r\nmiserable obsolete armor and with hearts that two hundred years of peace\r\nhad rendered more obsolete than their armor.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to consult the daimyōs and learn to what\r\nextent they could rely on their co-operation. The daimyō of Mito,(269) a\r\ndescendant of the famous Mitsukuni, seemed to have inherited one at least\r\nof the opinions of his ancestor. He advocated the observance of a greater\r\nreverence for the emperor at Kyōto, and criticised the assumption of\r\nimperial powers by the shōgun. At the same time he was an ardent\r\nforeign-hater, and in 1841 had been placed in confinement because he had\r\nmelted down the bells of the Buddhist temples of his domains, and cast\r\ncannon for their protection. But now he was pardoned and appointed to take\r\nmeasures for the defence of the country. On the 15th of July—the American\r\nsquadron was still in the bay, for it left on the 17th—the daimyō of Mito\r\nsent in to the government a memorial(270) setting forth his decisive views\r\non the subject. He gave ten reasons against a treaty and in favor of war.\r\nWe give them here in Mr. Nitobe’s translation:\r\n\r\n“1. The annals of our history speak of the exploits of the great, who\r\nplanted our banners on alien soil; but never was the clash of foreign arms\r\nheard within the precincts of our holy ground. Let not our generation be\r\nthe first to see the disgrace of a barbarian army treading on the land\r\nwhere our fathers rest.\r\n\r\n“2. Notwithstanding the strict interdiction of Christianity, there are\r\nthose guilty of the heinous crime of professing the doctrines of this evil\r\nsect. If now America be once admitted into our favor, the rise of this\r\nfaith is a matter of certainty.\r\n\r\n“3. What! Trade our gold, silver, copper, iron, and sundry useful\r\nmaterials for wool, glass, and similar trashy little articles! Even the\r\nlimited barter of the Dutch factory ought to have been stopped.\r\n\r\n“4. Many a time recently have Russia and other countries solicited trade\r\nwith us; but they were refused. If once America is permitted the\r\nprivilege, what excuse is there for not extending the same to other\r\nnations?\r\n\r\n“5. The policy of the barbarians is first to enter a country for trade,\r\nthen to introduce their religion, and afterward to stir up strife and\r\ncontention. Be guided by the experience of our forefathers two centuries\r\nback; despise not the teachings of the Chinese Opium War.\r\n\r\n“6. The Dutch scholars say that our people should cross the ocean, go to\r\nother countries and engage in active trade. This is all very desirable,\r\nprovided they be as brave and strong as were their ancestors in olden\r\ntime; but at present the long-continued peace has incapacitated them for\r\nany such activity.\r\n\r\n“7. The necessity of caution against the ships now lying in the harbor\r\n(_i.e._, Perry’s squadron) has brought the valiant _samurai_ to the\r\ncapital from distant quarters. Is it wise to disappoint them?\r\n\r\n“8. Not only the naval defence of Nagasaki but all things relating to\r\nforeign affairs have been entrusted to the two clans of Kuroda and\r\nNabeshima. To hold any conference with a foreign power outside of the port\r\nof Nagasaki—as has been done this time at Uraga—is to encroach upon their\r\nrights and trust. These powerful families will not thankfully accept an\r\nintrusion into their vested authority.\r\n\r\n“9. The haughty demeanor of the barbarians now at anchorage has provoked\r\neven the illiterate populace. Should nothing be done to show that the\r\ngovernment shares the indignation of the people, they will lose all fear\r\nand respect for it.\r\n\r\n“10. Peace and prosperity of long duration have enervated the spirit,\r\nrusted the armor, and blunted the swords of our men. Dulled to ease, when\r\nshall they be aroused? Is not the present the most auspicious moment to\r\nquicken their sinews of war?”\r\n\r\nThe government sent to all the daimyōs copies of the American letter to\r\nthe shōgun, and asked for their opinions concerning the course to be\r\npursued. Many answers were immediately received. They almost unanimously\r\ndeclared against the opening of the country. Some advocated the\r\nalternative suggested in the letter itself, to open the country\r\ntemporarily and try the experiment for three years, or five years, or ten\r\nyears. In the meantime the defences of the country and new and improved\r\narms and armaments could be perfected. The government did indeed busy\r\nitself during Perry’s absence in hurrying forward defensive preparations.\r\nThe line of forts which still are visible in the shallow water of the bay\r\nopposite Shinagawa, the southern suburb of the capital, were hastily\r\nconstructed. Bells from monasteries and metal articles of luxury were\r\nmelted down and cast into cannon. Lessons were given and became quickly\r\nfashionable in the use of European small-arms and artillery. The military\r\nclass from the various clans flocked to Yedo and Kyōto in large numbers,\r\nexpecting to be called upon to defend their country against the impudent\r\nintrusion of the barbarians.\r\n\r\nDuring this busy time of perplexity and preparation the Shōgun\r\nIeyoshi,—the twelfth of the Tokugawa dynasty—died August 25, 1853. His son\r\nIesada succeeded him as the thirteenth shōgun. The death of the reigning\r\nshōgun did not produce any marked effect upon the policy of the\r\ngovernment. Long before this time the custom of abdication, and the habits\r\nof luxury and effeminacy in which the family of the shōgun was reared, had\r\ndragged the house down to the usual impotent level. The government was\r\nconducted by a system of bureaucracy which relieved the titular shōguns\r\nfrom all responsibility and allowed them to live in profitless\r\nvoluptuousness. So that one died and another reigned in his stead without\r\ncausing more than a ripple upon the surface of current events.\r\n\r\nShortly after the departure of the American squadron from Yedo bay, the\r\nRussian Admiral Pontiatine appeared in the harbor of Nagasaki, and made\r\napplication for a national agreement to open ports for trade, to adjust\r\nthe boundary line between the two nations across the island of Saghalien,\r\nand to live in neighborly intimacy. English vessels were also in Chinese\r\nwaters watching the Russians, and the war, usually called the Crimean war,\r\nactually broke out in the spring of 1854. A visit from these vessels might\r\ntherefore be expected at any time.\r\n\r\nCommodore Perry during the interval between his two visits to Japan sailed\r\nto the ports of China where the Taiping rebellion was then in action. The\r\nconfusion and insecurity occasioned by this uprising rendered the presence\r\nof the squadron most acceptable to the American merchants.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of February, 1854, he made his appearance a second time in\r\nYedo bay with a fleet of seven ships, viz., three steam frigates and four\r\nsloops-of-war. Three additional vessels were to join, and did join, the\r\nfleet in Yedo bay. So that when the fleet was all mustered there were ten\r\nfully armed vessels, comprising such an array as had never before appeared\r\nin Japanese waters.\r\n\r\nAfter some haggling about the place where the negotiations should be\r\nconducted, it was finally settled that the place of meeting should be at\r\nKanagawa, near the village (now the city) of Yokohama. Here after much\r\ndeliberation and discussion, proposals and amendments, banquets and\r\npresents, a treaty was agreed upon. The signing and exchange took place on\r\nthe 31st of March, 1854. It was immediately sent to Washington for\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nAs this was the first formal treaty(271) made with any western country we\r\ngive a synopsis of its provisions.\r\n\r\nArt. I. Peace and amity to exist between the two countries.\r\n\r\nArt. II. The port of Shimoda to be opened immediately and the port of\r\nHakodate to be opened in one year, and American ships to be supplied with\r\nnecessary provisions in them.\r\n\r\nArt. III. Shipwrecked persons of either nation to be cared for, and\r\nexpenses to be refunded.\r\n\r\nArt. IV. Shipwrecked and other persons not to be imprisoned but to be\r\namenable to just laws.\r\n\r\nArt. V. Americans at Shimoda and Hakodate not to be subject to\r\nconfinement; free to go about within defined limits.\r\n\r\nArt. VI. Further deliberation to be held between the parties to settle\r\nconcerning trade and matters requiring to be arranged.\r\n\r\nArt. VII. Trade in open ports to be subject to such regulations as the\r\nJapanese government shall establish.\r\n\r\nArt. VIII. Wood, water, provisions, coal, etc., to be procured only\r\nthrough appointed Japanese officers.\r\n\r\nArt. IX. If at any future day privileges in addition to those here\r\nenumerated are granted to any other nation, the same to be allowed to\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nArt. X. Ships of the United States not to resort to other ports than\r\nShimoda and Hakodate except in stress of weather.\r\n\r\nArt. XI. Consuls or agents of the United States to reside at Shimoda.\r\n\r\nArt. XII. The ratification of this treaty to be exchanged within eighteen\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n                  -------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, as soon as this treaty with the United States\r\nhad been signed there was a rush of other nations to obtain similar terms.\r\nAdmiral Sir John Sterling, acting in behalf of the government of Great\r\nBritain, negotiated a treaty which was signed at Nagasaki on the 15th of\r\nOctober, 1854. Admiral Pontiatine negotiated a similar treaty for Russia,\r\nwhich was signed at Shimoda on the 7th of February, 1855. A treaty with\r\nthe Netherlands was signed on the 30th of January, 1856.\r\n\r\nNone of these were in any general sense commercial treaties, providing for\r\ntrade and making regulations by which it might be conducted. They were\r\nrather preliminary conventions, making arrangements for vessels to obtain\r\nnecessary provisions, and stipulating for the protection of those\r\nsuffering shipwreck, and for vessels driven under stress of weather to\r\ntake shelter in the harbors of Japan. They each provided for admission to\r\ntwo ports: The American treaty to Shimoda and Hakodate; the English treaty\r\nto Nagasaki and Hakodate; the Russian treaty to Shimoda and Hakodate.\r\n\r\nAll these treaties contained what is called “the most favored nation\r\nclause,” so that where the privileges granted to any one nation were in\r\nexcess of those granted previously to others, these privileges were also\r\nwithout further negotiation extended to the nations that had already made\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nThese dealings with foreign nations produced the most intense excitement\r\nthroughout the empire. The old sentiment of hostility to foreign\r\nintercourse showed itself in unmistakable intensity. The song of the Black\r\nShip, by which term the vessels of foreign nations were designated, was\r\nheard everywhere. Two distinct parties came into existence called the\r\n_Jo-i_ party, who wished to expel the barbarians; and the _Kai-koku_\r\nparty, who were in favor of opening the country.(272) The members of the\r\nlatter party were principally connected with the shōgun’s government, and\r\nhad become impressed with the folly of trying to resist the pressure of\r\nthe outside world. The _Jo-i_ party was made up of the conservative\r\nelements in the country, who clung to the old traditions of Japan that had\r\nmatured during the two centuries of the Tokugawa rule. Besides these\r\nconservatives there was also a party who nourished a traditional dislike\r\nto the Tokugawa family, and was glad to see it involved in difficulties\r\nwhich were sure to bring down upon it the vengeance of the nation. These\r\nwere chiefly found among the southwestern daimiates such as Satsuma,\r\nChōshū, Hizen, and Tosa. The daimyō of Mito(273) although connected with\r\nthe shōgun’s family was bitterly hostile to the policy of holding any\r\nfriendly relations with foreigners. He was therefore regarded as the head\r\nof the _Jo-i_ party, and many of the disaffected _samurai_ rallied about\r\nhim as their champion and leader.\r\n\r\nIt was charged against the shōgun that in making treaties with foreign\r\nnations he had transcended the powers(274) that rightly belonged to him.\r\nHe was not the sovereign of Japan and never had been. He was only the\r\nchief executive under the emperor, and was not even next in rank to the\r\nemperor. It was impossible, therefore, that treaties made by the shōgun\r\nand not ratified by his sovereign should be regarded by the Japanese as\r\nlegitimate and binding.\r\n\r\nThe question of the legality of the treaties which the shōgun had made was\r\nan important one, and interested not only the Japanese themselves but the\r\nforeigners whose privileges under these treaties were at stake. There is\r\nno doubt that Commodore Perry as well as all the subsequent negotiators,\r\nbelieved that in making treaties with the shōgun they were dealing with a\r\ncompetent authority. The precedents occurring in the history of Japan\r\nseemed all to bear in this direction. The Portuguese and the Spanish had\r\ndealt with the shōgun and never with the emperor. The Dutch had received\r\nfrom Ieyasu the privileges of trade and had ever since continued under the\r\nshōgun’s protection. Captain Saris in his negotiations in 1614 received\r\nwritten assurances of protection and privileges of trade from the shōgun.\r\n\r\nIt was because the shōgun’s power had become weakened, and there had grown\r\nup an active sentiment against him, that the question in reference to his\r\nlegitimate authority arose. “Had the treaty” (with Perry) “been concluded\r\nwhen the power of Yedo was at its former height, it is probable that no\r\nquestions would have been asked.”(275)\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of the treaty made with the United States it was\r\nprovided that a consul should be appointed “to reside at Shimoda at any\r\ntime after the expiration of eighteen months from the signing the treaty.”\r\nIn execution of this provision the United States government sent out\r\nTownsend Harris, who arrived in August, 1856. After some hesitation he was\r\nallowed to take up his residence at Shimoda. He was a man of great\r\npatience and tact, and gradually urged his way into the confidence of the\r\ngovernment. He became the counsellor and educator of the officials in\r\neverything pertaining to foreign affairs. He was received December 7,\r\n1857, by the shōgun with the ceremony due to his new rank of\r\nplenipotentiary which he had then received.(276) In a despatch, dated July\r\n8, 1858, he tells of a severe illness which he had suffered; how the\r\nshōgun sent two physicians to attend him, and when a bulletin was sent to\r\nYedo that his case was hopeless, the physicians “received peremptory\r\norders to cure me, and if I died they would themselves be in peril.”\r\n\r\nThe principal effort of Mr. Harris was the negotiation of a commercial\r\ntreaty which should make provision for the maintenance of trade in\r\nspecified ports of Japan. The treaties already made by Japan with foreign\r\nnations only provided for furnishing vessels with needed supplies, and for\r\nthe protection of vessels driven by stress of weather and of persons\r\nshipwrecked on the Japanese islands. It remained to agree upon terms,\r\nwhich should be mutually advantageous, for the regular opening of the\r\nports for trade and for the residence at these ports of the merchants\r\nengaged in trade.\r\n\r\nThe excitement occasioned by the steps already taken rendered the shōgun’s\r\ngovernment exceedingly reluctant to proceed further in this direction. It\r\nwas only after much persuasion, and with a desire to avoid appearing to\r\nyield to the appearance of force(277) with which the English were about to\r\nurge the negotiation of a commercial treaty, that at last, on the 17th of\r\nJune, 1857, a treaty “for the purpose of further regulating the\r\nintercourse of American citizens within the empire of Japan” was duly\r\nconcluded. The port of Nagasaki was to be opened in addition to those\r\nalready stipulated. American citizens were to be permitted to reside at\r\nShimoda and Hakodate for the purpose of supplying the wants of the vessels\r\nwhich visited there.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to have been adequate, for only about a year later a\r\nfurther treaty, revoking that of June, 1857, was arranged. It was signed\r\nat Yedo on the 29th of July, 1858. Equivalent treaties were negotiated by\r\nother nations, and it is under the terms of these that the intercourse\r\nbetween Japan and the nations of Europe and America is still conducted.\r\nThey provided for the opening of the ports of Ni-igata and Hyōgo, and for\r\nthe closing of Shimoda, which had been found unsuitable, and the opening\r\nin its place of Kanagawa.(278) They fixed dates for the opening of the\r\ncities of Yedo and Ōsaka, and provided for the setting apart of suitable\r\nconcessions in each of them for residence and trade. They provided that\r\nall cases of litigation in which foreigners were defendants should be\r\ntried in the consular court of the nation to which the defendant belonged,\r\nand all cases in which Japanese citizens were defendants should be tried\r\nin Japanese courts. They fixed the limits within which foreigners at any\r\nof the treaty ports could travel, but permitted the diplomatic agent of\r\nany nation to travel without limitation. They prohibited the importation\r\nof opium. Commercial regulations were attached to the treaties and made a\r\npart of them, which directed that a duty of five _per centum_ should be\r\npaid on all goods imported into Japan for sale, except that on\r\nintoxicating liquors a duty of thirty-five _per centum_ should be exacted.\r\nAll articles of Japanese production exported were to pay a duty of five\r\n_per centum_, except gold and silver coin and copper in bars. These trade\r\nregulations stipulated that five years after the opening of Kanagawa the\r\nexport and import duties should be subject to revision at the desire of\r\neither party. The treaties themselves provide that on and after 1872\r\neither of the contracting parties may demand a revision of the same upon\r\ngiving one year’s notice of its desire.\r\n\r\nThese stipulations in reference to a revision of the treaties, and\r\nespecially of the tariff of duties to be paid on imported goods, have been\r\na source of great anxiety and concern to the Japanese government. The\r\nsmall duty of five _per centum_, which it has been permitted to collect on\r\nthe goods imported, is scarcely more than enough to maintain the machinery\r\nof collection. And while the initiative is given to it to ask for a\r\nrevision of the treaties, it has never yet been able to obtain the consent\r\nof the principal nations concerned to any change in the original hard\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nAnother provision in the treaties which has been the occasion of endless\r\ndebate is that which requires all foreigners to remain under the\r\njurisdiction of the consuls of their respective countries. It is claimed\r\non the part of the Japanese that this provision, which was reasonable when\r\nthe treaties were first made, is no longer just or necessary. The laws\r\nhave been so far perfected, their judges and officers have been so\r\neducated, and the machinery of their courts have been so far conformed to\r\nEuropean practice that it is no longer reasonable that foreigners residing\r\nin Japan should be under other than Japanese jurisdiction. It is earnestly\r\nto be hoped that these sources of irritation between Japan and the treaty\r\npowers may speedily be removed, and that the efforts of this progressive\r\nrace to fall into line in the march of civilization may be appreciated and\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\nAny one who reads the diplomatic correspondence covering this period will\r\nsee how serious were the troubles with which the country was called upon\r\nto deal. He will realize also how almost impossible it was for the\r\ndiplomatic representatives of the western powers to comprehend the\r\ndifficulties of the situation or know how to conduct the affairs of their\r\nlegations with justice and consideration.\r\n\r\nA succession of murders and outrages occurred, which awakened the fears of\r\nthe foreign residents. It is plain enough now that this state of things\r\nwas not so much due to the want of effort on the part of the government to\r\ncarry out its agreements with foreign nations, as to the bitter and\r\nirreconcilable party hatred which had sprung up in consequence of these\r\nefforts. The feudal organization of the government, by which the first\r\nallegiance was due to the daimyō, rendered the condition of things more\r\ndemoralized. It was an old feudal custom, whenever the retainers of a\r\ndaimyō wished to avenge any act without committing their lord, they\r\nwithdrew from his service and became _ronins_. Most of the outrages which\r\noccurred during the years intervening between the formation of the\r\ntreaties and the restoration were committed by these masterless men.\r\nResponsibility for them was disclaimed by the daimyōs, and the government\r\nof Yedo was unable to extend its control over these wandering\r\nswash-bucklers. There was no course for the foreign ministers to pursue\r\nbut to hold the shōgun’s government responsible for the protection of\r\nforeigners and foreign trade. This government, which was called the\r\n_bakufu_,(279) had made the treaties with the foreign powers, as many\r\nclaimed, without having adequate authority, and had thus assumed to be\r\nsupreme in matters of foreign intercourse. It was natural therefore that\r\nthe representatives of the treaty powers should look to the _bakufu_ for\r\nthe security of those who had come hither under the sanction of these\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nIt was in consequence a bloody time through which the country was called\r\nto pass. The prime minister and the head of the _bakufu_ party was Ii\r\nKamon-no-kami,(280) the daimyō of Hikoné in the province of Mino. On\r\naccount of the youth of the shōgun he was created regent. He was a man of\r\ngreat resolution and unscrupulous in the measures by which he attempted to\r\ncarry out the policy to which he was committed. By his enemies he was\r\ncalled the “swaggering prime minister (_bakko genro_).” Assured that the\r\nforeign treaties could not be abrogated without dangerous collisions with\r\nforeign nations, he sought to crush the opposition which assailed them.\r\nThe daimyō of Mito, who had been the head of the anti-foreign party at\r\nYedo, he compelled to resign and confined him to his private palace in his\r\nprovince. Numerous other persons who had busied themselves with\r\ninterfering with his schemes and in promoting opposition in Kyōto, he also\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nSuddenly on the 23d of March, 1860, Ii Kamon-no-kami was assassinated as\r\nhe was being carried in his _norimono_ from his _yashiki_ outside the\r\nSakurada gate to the palace of the shōgun.\r\n\r\nThe assassins were eighteen _ronins_ of the province of Mito, who wished\r\nto avenge the imprisonment of their prince. They carried the head of the\r\nmurdered regent to the Mito castle, and after exhibiting it to the\r\ngloating eyes of the prince, exposed it upon a pike at the principal gate.\r\n\r\nThe death of the regent was an irreparable blow to the government. There\r\nwas no one who could take his place and assume his _rôle_. His loss must\r\nbe reckoned as one of the principal events which marked the decadence of\r\nthe shōgun’s power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. REVOLUTIONARY PRELUDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outrages which now succeeded each other with terrible frequency were\r\nnot confined to the native members of the opposing parties. Foreigners,\r\nwho were so essentially the cause of the political disturbances in Japan,\r\nwere particularly exposed to attacks. On the 14th of January, 1861, Mr.\r\nHeusken, the secretary and interpreter of the American legation, when\r\nriding home at night from the Prussian legation in Yedo, was attacked by\r\narmed assassins and mortally wounded. The object of this murder is\r\nsupposed to have been the desire of one of the ministers of foreign\r\naffairs to take revenge on Mr. Heusken,(281) for his activity in promoting\r\nforeign intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe weakness and the fears of the government were shown by the warning,\r\nwhich they sent to the foreign ministers to avoid attending the funeral of\r\nMr. Heusken, lest further outrages might be committed. They did attend,\r\nhowever, and no disturbances occurred. It only remains to mention that Mr.\r\nHarris subsequently made an arrangement with the government for the\r\npayment of an indemnity(282) of $10,000 to the mother of Mr. Heusken, who\r\nwas then living at Amsterdam in Holland.\r\n\r\nThe next circumstance which awakened universal attention was an attack\r\nmade on the British legation, on the night of the 5th of July, 1861. At\r\nthis time the British minister occupied as a legation the buildings of the\r\ntemple Tozenji, situated at Takanawa in the city of Yedo. It was guarded\r\nby a company of Japanese troops, to whom the government had entrusted its\r\nprotection. Mr. Alcock had just returned by an overland journey from\r\nNagasaki, and with a number of other Englishmen was domiciled in the\r\nlegation. The attacking party consisted of fourteen _ronins_ belonging to\r\nthe Mito clan, who had banded themselves together to take vengeance on the\r\n“accursed foreigners.” Several of the guards were killed, and Mr.\r\nOliphant,(283) the secretary of legation, and Mr. Morrison, H. B. M’s\r\nconsul at Nagasaki, were severely wounded. On one of the party who was\r\ncaptured was found a paper,(284) which set forth the object of the attack\r\nand the names of the fourteen _ronins_ who had conspired for its\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThat the government regarded such outrages with alarm is certain. They\r\ntook the earliest opportunity to express their distress that the legation\r\nunder their protection had thus been invaded. They assured Mr. Alcock with\r\nthe most pitiable sincerity that “they had no power of preventing such\r\nattacks upon the legation, nor of providing against a renewal of the same\r\nwith a greater certainty of success.” “They could not,” they said,\r\n“guarantee any of the representatives against these attempts at\r\nassassination, to which all foreigners in Japan were liable, whether in\r\ntheir houses or in the public thoroughfares.”(285) They pretended to\r\npunish, and yet were afraid openly to punish the persons engaged in this\r\nattack.(286) They promised to do what they could for the protection of the\r\nforeign representatives; but their measures necessarily consisted in\r\nmaking the legations a kind of prison where the occupants were confined\r\nand protected.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, with all these assurances of danger, the foreign representatives\r\nseem to have been singularly ignorant of the real difficulties with which\r\nthe government had to deal. This was due, no doubt, to the want of candor\r\non the part of the Japanese officials in not explaining frankly and fully\r\nto them the political complications which existed between the governments\r\nof Yedo and Kyōto. They represented a widespread discontent to have grown\r\nup since the negotiation of the treaties, owing to the increased price of\r\nprovisions, the derangement of the currency, and the danger of famine. In\r\nview of these pressing difficulties they asked for the postponement of the\r\ntime fixed by the treaties for opening a port on the western coast and\r\nHyōgo on the Inland sea, and for the establishment of definite concessions\r\nin the cities of Yedo and Ōsaka. These modifications of the treaties were\r\nfinally accepted, and it was arranged that the opening of the ports named\r\nabove should be postponed for a period of five years from the first of\r\nJanuary, 1863.\r\n\r\nThis postponement of the opening of the ports was the chief reason for\r\nsending to foreign countries their first embassy. This set out from\r\nYokohama in January, 1862, and visited the United States, then England,\r\nand the other treaty powers. They were everywhere received with the utmost\r\nkindness and distinction. The immediate object of their mission was, as we\r\nhave seen, accomplished. The opening of additional ports was deferred on\r\ncondition that in those already opened the obstacles which had been put in\r\nthe way of trade should be removed.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the attainment of this end, the visit of the embassy to\r\nforeign capitals and countries produced a salutary influence both on the\r\nforeigners whom they met and on the influential personages of which it\r\nconsisted. The former learned to their surprise that they had a\r\ncultivated, intelligent, and clever race to deal with, whose\r\ndiplomatists,(287) although inexperienced in European politics, were not\r\nunqualified to enter the courts of western capitals. But the revelation to\r\nthe Japanese envoys was still greater and more surprising. For the first\r\ntime they saw the terrible armaments of western powers, and realized the\r\nfutility of attempting to make armed resistance to their measures. But\r\nthey encountered on every hand not hatred and aversion, but the warmest\r\ninterest and kindness,(288) and a desire to render them every courtesy.\r\nInstead of barbarians, as they had been taught to regard all foreigners,\r\nthey found everywhere warm-hearted and intelligent friends who were\r\nanxious to see their country treated with justice and consideration.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of June, 1862, a year after the first, a second attack was\r\nmade upon the British legation. Lieutenant-Colonel Neale was at this time\r\n_chargé d’affaires_, and had just removed from Yokohama and resumed the\r\noccupancy of the temple of Tozenji. The government took the precaution to\r\nestablish guards, who daily and nightly made their rounds to protect the\r\nbuildings. Besides this there was a guard detailed from the British fleet\r\nto render the legation more secure. The officials persisted in claiming\r\nthat only one person, Itō Gumpei, was engaged in the attack, and that it\r\nwas a matter of private revenge for an insult which one of the English\r\nguards had put upon him. Two of these guards were killed in the attack,\r\nand Itō Gumpei the assassin escaped to his own house, where he was\r\npermitted to commit _hara-kiri_. There was probably no plot on the part of\r\nthose whose duty it was to protect the legation. But the uncertainty which\r\nhung over the affair, and the repetition of the violence of the preceding\r\nyear led Colonel Neale to abandon his residence at Yedo and return to\r\nYokohama. An indemnity of £10,000 was demanded and finally paid for the\r\nfamilies of the two members of the guard who had been murdered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the relations between the courts at Kyōto and Yedo had\r\nbecome more and more strained. The efforts at reconciliation, such as the\r\nmarriage between the young shōgun and the sister of the emperor in 1861,\r\nproduced no permanent effect. The disease was too deep-seated and serious\r\nto be affected by such palliations. Shimazu Saburō, the uncle(289) and\r\nguardian of the young daimyō of Satsuma, came in 1862 to Kyōto with the\r\navowed purpose of advising the emperor in this emergency. He was\r\naccompanied by a formidable body of Satsuma troops, and on these he relied\r\nto have his advice followed.\r\n\r\nOn his way thither he had been joined by a body of _ronins_ who were\r\ncontemplating the accomplishment of some enterprise which should be\r\nnotable in the expulsion of foreigners. They imagined that the powerful\r\nhead of the Satsuma clan would be a suitable leader for such an\r\nenterprise. They approached him therefore and humbly petitioned to be\r\nreceived under his standard. Not quite satisfied to have such a band of\r\nreckless ruffians under his command, he, however, scarcely dared to refuse\r\ntheir petition. He therefore permitted them to join his escort and march\r\nwith him to Kyōto.\r\n\r\nThe emperor’s court, although bitterly hostile to the liberal policy which\r\nprevailed at Yedo, were alarmed by the desperate allies which Shimazu was\r\nbringing with him. He presented their memorial to the emperor, and favored\r\ntheir wishes to use all the force of the country to dislodge the hated\r\nforeigner from its soil. Other powerful daimyōs were collected at the same\r\ntime at the imperial capital, and its peaceful suburbs resounded with the\r\nclank of warlike preparations. The most notable of these was the daimyō of\r\nChōshū, who at this time was joined with the Satsuma chief in the measures\r\nagainst the shōgun’s government.\r\n\r\nShimazu continued his journey to Yedo in the summer of 1862, where he\r\nendeavored to impress on the _bakufu_ the necessity of taking measures to\r\npacify the country. It is safe to say that his suggestions were coldly\r\nreceived, and he was made to feel that he was in an enemy’s camp. It is\r\nsaid that the shōgun refused to receive him personally, but referred him,\r\nfor any business which he had to present, to the council. It is certain,\r\ntherefore, when he left Yedo in September, 1862, with his train and\r\nescort, he was in no amiable frame of mind. And it was in this condition\r\nof irritation that he became the chief actor in an event which was the\r\nsaddest of all the collisions between the Japanese and the foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe Satsuma train left Yedo on the morning of the 14th of September by way\r\nof the _Tōkaidō_, which runs through Kawasaki and skirts the village of\r\nKanagawa. It consisted of a semi-military procession of guards on foot and\r\non horseback, of _norimonos_, in which the prince and his high military\r\nand civil attendants were carried, of led-horses for them to ride when\r\nthey desired, and of a long straggling continuation of pack-horses and men\r\ncarrying the luggage of the train. It was said to contain not less than\r\neight hundred _samurai_ in attendance on their master.\r\n\r\nThe etiquette of the road for such trains was well settled in feudal\r\nJapan. The right of way was always accorded to the daimyō, and all\r\nunmilitary persons or parties were required to stand at the side of the\r\nroad while the train was passing, to dismount if on horseback, and to bow\r\nto the daimyō’s _norimono_ as it was carried past. It may be supposed that\r\nthe _samurai_ in attendance upon the incensed Shimazu were in no humor to\r\nhave these rules trifled with, and especially would not deal very tenderly\r\nwith any foreigners who might fall in their way.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day on which the Satsuma train left Yedo, a small\r\nriding party left Yokohama for the village of Kawasaki, on a visit to the\r\ntemple at that place. It consisted of one lady and three gentlemen, one of\r\nwhom was Mr. Charles L. Richardson, who had for many years been a merchant\r\nat Shanghai, but who was visiting Japan previous to his return to England.\r\nA few miles north of the village of Kanagawa they encountered the head of\r\nthe train, and for some distance passed successive parts of it. They were\r\neither ignorant of the etiquette which required them to withdraw during\r\nthe passage of such a cavalcade, or underrated the danger of disregarding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nPresently they came upon the troop which had special charge of the\r\n_norimono_ in which the prince was carried. It was surrounded by a\r\nformidable body of retainers, armed with swords and spears. The reckless\r\nriders paid little heed to their scowling looks, and rode carelessly on,\r\nsometimes even threading their way through the interstices of the\r\nstraggling train. When they were nearly opposite to the prince’s\r\n_norimono_, which they were about to pass without dismounting or saluting,\r\nthey were so alarmed by the evidences of danger that one of the gentlemen\r\ncalled out to Mr. Richardson who was riding ahead, “Don’t go on, we can\r\nturn into a side road.” The other also exclaimed, “For God’s sake let us\r\nhave no row.” Richardson, who was foolhardy and ignorant of those with\r\nwhom he had to deal, answered, “Let me alone, I have lived fourteen years\r\nin China and know how to manage these people.” Suddenly a soldier from the\r\ncentre of the procession rushed upon them with a heavy two-handed sword\r\nand struck Richardson a fatal blow on his side under the left arm. Both\r\nthe other gentlemen were also severely wounded, and the lady had her\r\nbonnet knocked off by a blow aimed at her, but escaped unhurt. They all\r\nstarted at full speed towards home, riding over the Japanese guards who\r\nundertook to interfere. All except Richardson reached Kanagawa without\r\nfurther hurt; he after riding a few rods fell from his horse and died from\r\nthe effect of his terrible wound.(290)\r\n\r\nThe excitement in the town was intense. There was a proposition to\r\norganize immediately a force and pursue after the train, in order to\r\ncapture the murderer and the Satsuma chief. It was with no small effort\r\nand with the almost unanimous sentiment of the foreign community against\r\nhim, that Colonel Neale, the British _chargé d’affaires_, restrained them\r\nfrom an act which would have brought quick vengeance upon the town and\r\ninvolved Great Britain in a war with Japan. A demand was made upon the\r\ngovernment for the capture and punishment of the assassin of Mr.\r\nRichardson, and for the payment of an indemnity of £100,000, by the\r\nshōgun’s government and an additional sum by the daimyō of Satsuma.\r\n\r\nNeither the surrender of the assassin nor the payment of this indemnity\r\nwas willingly undertaken by Satsuma. It ended therefore in Admiral Kuper\r\nbeing despatched with a squadron of seven vessels to Kagoshima in order to\r\nenforce on the recalcitrant daimyō the terms agreed upon with the\r\ngovernment at Yedo. He arrived on the 11th of August, 1863, and was\r\nreceived with frowning batteries and a terrible typhoon of wind and rain.\r\nNegotiation failed to effect a settlement and the naval force was called\r\nupon to play its part. Three valuable new steamers, which the daimyō had\r\nrecently purchased, were captured and burned. The batteries which lined\r\nthe shore were dismantled by the guns of the ships. The city of Kagoshima,\r\nsaid to have had at this time a population of 180,000 and to have been one\r\nof the most prosperous towns in Japan, was almost completely destroyed by\r\nfire. After this drastic lesson the money demanded was paid, but the\r\nmurderer of Richardson was not and probably could not be surrendered, and\r\nnever has been publicly known.\r\n\r\nThe most important result which followed this severe experience was its\r\nmoral effect on the Satsuma leaders. They had become convinced that\r\nwestern skill and western equipments of war were not to be encountered by\r\nthe antiquated methods of Japan. To contend with the foreigner on anything\r\nlike equal terms it would be necessary to acquire his culture and\r\ndexterity, and avail themselves of his ships and armaments. It was not\r\nlong after this therefore, that the first company of Japanese\r\nstudents(291) were sent to London under the late Count Terashima by the\r\ndaimyō of Satsuma, and the purchase of cannon and ships of war was\r\nauthorized.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime another collision still more serious had occurred with the\r\ntreaty powers. The daimyō of Chōshū had, as we have seen, taken sides with\r\nthe court of Kyōto against the more liberal policy of the shōgun’s\r\ngovernment. He had placed men-of-war as guards and had erected batteries\r\nwithin his territory on the shores of the Shimonoseki straits through\r\nwhich ships usually passed on their way to and from the western ports. It\r\nis claimed, and is not improbable, that he was encouraged by the Kyōto\r\nstatesmen to attack foreign ships on their way through these narrow\r\nstraits, in order to embroil the Yedo government with the treaty powers.\r\n\r\nAccordingly on the 25th of June, 1863 the _Pembroke_, a small American\r\nmerchant steamer on her way from Yokohama to Nagasaki was fired upon by\r\ntwo men-of-war belonging to the daimyō of Chōshū. She was not hit or hurt\r\nand escaped through the Bungo channel without injury. Shortly afterwards,\r\non the 8th of July, the French gunboat _Kienchang_ while at anchor in the\r\nstraits, was also fired upon and severely injured. And lastly the Dutch\r\nship-of-war _Medusa_, in spite of a warning from the _Kienchang_,\r\nundertook to pass the straits and was fired upon by the ships and\r\nbatteries of the daimyō of Chōshū, to which she responded with decisive\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nNews of these hostile acts was brought immediately to Yokohama. The U. S.\r\nSteamship _Wyoming_ was lying there, and was at once despatched to avenge\r\nthe insult to the American flag. She arrived at Shimonoseki on July 16th,\r\nand in a conflict with ships and batteries sunk a brig and exploded the\r\nboiler of a steamer. On the 20th inst. the French frigate _Semiramis_ and\r\nthe gunboat _Tancrede_ under the command of Admiral Juares arrived to\r\nexact vengeance for the attack on the _Kienchang_. One of the batteries\r\nwas silenced, and a force of two hundred and fifty men were landed who\r\ndestroyed what remained.\r\n\r\nThese acts of signal vengeance were followed by negotiations for damages.\r\nThe shōgun’s government disavowed the actions of their rebellious\r\nsubordinate; but this did not free them from responsibility for the\r\ninjuries which he had inflicted. The American minister secured the payment\r\nof twelve thousand dollars for alleged losses by the _Pembroke_, although\r\nas we have seen the vessel got off without any damage. Negotiations in\r\nregard to freeing the Inland sea from obstructions dragged along for\r\nalmost a year. The _bakufu_ promised to take measures to reduce to a\r\npeaceful attitude the daimyō of Chōshū whose territories bordered on the\r\nnarrow straits of Shimonoseki. But the growing political disturbances of\r\nthe nation and the impoverishment of the shōgun’s treasury made it\r\nimpossible to carry out its pacific designs.\r\n\r\nFinally an expedition was organized by the treaty powers to visit\r\nShimonoseki, in order to destroy whatever might be in existence there. It\r\nconsisted of nine British(292) ships-of-war, four Dutch, three French, and\r\none steamer, chartered for the occasion to represent the United\r\nStates.(293) It sailed from Yokohama on the 28th and 29th of August, 1864.\r\nThe attack was made from the 5th to the 8th of September. The daimyō,\r\nfinding it useless to contend against such overwhelming odds, gave in his\r\nabsolute submission.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the expedition the representatives of the allied\r\npowers held a conference with the Japanese ministers of foreign affairs\r\nwith reference to the final settlement of this unfortunate business. A\r\nconvention(294) was entered into between the interested parties, dated the\r\n22d of October, 1864, by which an indemnity of three million dollars was\r\nto be paid by Japan to the four powers for damages and for expenses\r\nentailed by the operations against the daimyō of Chōshū. This sum was to\r\nbe paid in instalments of half a million dollars each. The four powers\r\nagreed among themselves as to the division of this indemnity: That France,\r\nthe Netherlands, and the United States, in consideration of the actual\r\nattacks made on their shipping, were to receive each one hundred and forty\r\nthousand dollars, and that the remaining sum should be divided equally\r\nbetween the four powers.\r\n\r\nIt has always been felt that the exaction of this large indemnity was a\r\nharsh if not an unwarrantable proceeding. The government of Yedo had\r\ndisavowed and apologized for the conduct of the rebellious daimyō, and\r\npromised, if time were allowed, to reduce him to subjection. Of the powers\r\nwhich were allied in the expedition, Great Britain had suffered no damage,\r\nand the United States had already received an indemnity for the injuries\r\nand expenses of the vessel fired upon. To insist, therefore, upon the\r\ngovernment not only paying for the damage inflicted, but for the expense\r\nof an unnecessarily large and costly expedition to suppress the rebellious\r\nsubordinate, which was sent contrary to the express protest of the\r\nresponsible government, seems too much like that overbearing diplomacy\r\nwith which western nations have conducted their intercourse in the\r\nEast.(295) The promised sum, however, was at last, after much financial\r\ndistress, all paid, and the painful episode was ended.\r\n\r\nOne undesigned benefit resulted from the Shimonoseki expedition. Just as\r\nthe bombardment of Kagoshima had taught the daimyō of Satsuma the folly of\r\nresisting western armaments, so now the daimyō of Chōshū had learned by an\r\nexpensive experience the same bitter lesson. For the future these two\r\npowerful clans might therefore be counted on, not only to oppose the\r\nmoribund government of Yedo, but to withstand the folly of trying to expel\r\nthe foreigners who by treaty with an unauthorized agent had been admitted\r\ninto the country. The Chōshū leaders had also taken advantage of their\r\nexperiences in this conflict with foreigners to put their troops on a\r\nbetter basis as regards arms and organization. For the first time the\r\nprivilege of the _samurai_ to do all the fighting, was disregarded, and a\r\ndivision(296) of troops was formed from the common people, which was armed\r\nwith foreign muskets and drilled in the western tactics. They went by the\r\nname of “irregular troops” (_kiheitai_), and played no small part in\r\nrendering nugatory the efforts of the shōgun to “chastise” the daimyō of\r\nChōshū in 1865 and 1866.\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy military event deserves mention here. Colonel Neale had\r\napplied to his government for a military guard to protect British\r\ninterests at Yokohama. Two companies of the 20th regiment were sent from\r\nHongkong, and with the consent of the Japanese government took up their\r\nresidence in 1864 at barracks in the foreign settlement. They were\r\nafterwards joined by a French contingent, and for many years they were a\r\nfamiliar sight, and gave a sense of security to the nervous residents.\r\n\r\nWhile these serious collisions were taking place between Japan and the\r\nforeign powers, there was an increasing and irreconcilable animosity\r\ndeveloped between the Kyōto and Yedo governments. The ostensible reason,\r\nwhich was put forward on all occasions, was the difference of opinion upon\r\nthe question of the foreign treaties and foreign intercourse. The Yedo\r\ngovernment had by the force of circumstances become practically familiar\r\nwith the views of the representatives of foreign nations, and had been\r\nconvinced that the task of expelling foreigners and returning again to the\r\nancient policy of seclusion was far beyond the power of Japan. On the\r\ncontrary, the court of the emperor was a hot-bed of anti-foreign sentiment\r\nin which all the ancient prejudices of the empire naturally flourished,\r\nand where the feudal princes who were jealous of the shōgun found a ready\r\nelement in which to foment difficulties.\r\n\r\nTwo important games were in progress. Yedo was the field on which one of\r\nthese was to be decided, and the players were the representatives of the\r\ntreaty powers on the one side, and the shōgun’s government on the other.\r\nVictory had already been virtually declared in favor of an open country\r\nand foreign intercourse. The other game was being played at Kyōto between\r\nthe shōgun’s friends and his enemies. The stake was a momentous one,\r\nnamely, to determine whether the present dual government was to continue\r\nand who was hereafter to wield the destinies of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe government of the shōgun had long been convinced that it was necessary\r\nto make the best of the presence of foreigners in the country and that it\r\nwas vain to make further exertions for their expulsion. But a vast number\r\nof the feudal retainers of the daimyōs were still bitterly hostile, and\r\ntook frequent occasion to commit outrages, for which the government was\r\nheld responsible. Besides the cases which have been already mentioned, a\r\nnew legation which the British government had built in Gotenyama, a site\r\nwhich the Japanese government had set apart in Yedo for foreign legations,\r\nwas burned to the ground in 1863. In the same year the temple buildings in\r\nYedo which the United States had leased for a legation were burned. Twice\r\nthe shōgun’s castle in Yedo had been destroyed by fire. A murderous attack\r\nwas made upon British subjects in Nagasaki; Lieutenant de Cannes of the\r\nFrench troops was assassinated in 1864; and in the same year Major Baldwin\r\nand Lieutenant Bird, two British officers, were murdered at Kamakura.\r\n\r\nThese repeated outrages seriously disturbed the Yedo government, and led\r\nto several attempts to curtail the privileges which by the treaties were\r\nsecured to foreigners. The last proposition of the kind which was made was\r\none conveyed to the French government by an embassy sent out in 1864. They\r\npresented a request to have the port of Kanagawa closed up and trade to be\r\nconfined to Hakodate and Nagasaki. They received no encouragement,\r\nhowever, and returned with their eyes “opened by the high state of\r\nmaterial and moral prosperity which surrounded them,” and reported the\r\ncomplete failure of their attempts at persuasion. “The _bakufu_\r\nreprimanded them for having disgraced their functions, and, reducing their\r\nincomes, forced them to retire into private life.”(297)\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now to trace the course of events at Kyōto. According to\r\nthe theory of the government of Japan the emperor was the supreme and\r\nunlimited ruler and the shōgun was his executive. The maintenance of the\r\nemperor and his court was a function of the shōgun, and hence it was\r\nalmost always possible for him to compel the emperor to pursue any policy\r\nwhich he might desire.\r\n\r\nAt the time now under review Kōmei, the father of the present emperor,\r\noccupied the imperial throne. He had succeeded to this dignity in 1847 at\r\nthe age of eighteen, and he died in 1866 at the age of thirty-seven. The\r\nshōgun was Iemochi, who in 1858 had been chosen from the family of Kii,\r\nbecause of the failure of an heir in the regular line. At the time of his\r\nelection he was a boy of twelve years of age, and was placed under the\r\nguardianship of the prime minister Ii Kamon-no-kami. After the\r\nassassination of the prime minister in 1861, Hitotsubashi Gyōbukyō, a son\r\nof the daimyō of Mito, was appointed guardian, and served in this capacity\r\nuntil the shōgun’s death.\r\n\r\nAround the court of the emperor were gathered many discordant elements.\r\nThe party of the shōgun was always represented, and the daimyō of Aizu,\r\nits ardent friend and champion, had the honorable distinction of guarding\r\nthe imperial palace. By invitation many other daimyōs were at Kyōto with\r\nretinues of officers and attendants, and with guards of troops. The\r\nsouthern and western daimyōs were present in imposing numbers, and\r\nalthough they did not always agree among themselves, they were in harmony\r\nin the general purpose to discredit the government at Yedo and to promote\r\nthe imperial authority.\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of foreigners was the common subject of discussion and\r\nagitation. Although again and again it had been assured that it was\r\nimpossible to dislodge the treaty powers from their position in the\r\ncountry, the court still continued to direct its efforts to this object.\r\nFor the first time in two hundred and thirty years,(298) when Iemitsu went\r\nup to the imperial court, the Shōgun Iemochi visited Kyōto in 1863 in\r\norder to consult about the affairs of the country. In accordance with the\r\nprecedent set by Iemitsu, the shōgun distributed on this occasion rich\r\npresents to the emperor and the officers of his court. He also scattered\r\namong the townspeople his largesses, until “the whole populace, moistened\r\nin the bath of his mercy and goodness, were greatly pleased and\r\ngratified.”(299)\r\n\r\nConferences(300) were held between the daimyōs who were present in Kyōto\r\nand the officials of the court, and in spite of the objections and\r\nremonstrances of the Yedo official, an imperial edict was issued and\r\nentrusted to the shōgun for execution, to expel from the country the hated\r\nforeigners. This edict was notified to the representatives of the treaty\r\npowers by the Yedo officials. They seemed, however, to regard their duty\r\nfully done when this notice was given. No serious steps were ever taken to\r\ncarry out these expulsive measures, unless the obstruction of navigation\r\nof the Shimonoseki straits by the daimyō of Chōshū be regarded of this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 a plot was alleged to have been formed by the Chōshū men to seize\r\nthe emperor and carry him off to their own territory. The object aimed at\r\nby this plot was of course to get the court out of the hands of the\r\nshōgun’s friends, and surround it by influences favorable to the plans of\r\nthe southern daimyōs. The court, however, became alarmed by the reports in\r\ncirculation, and steps were taken to forbid the Chōshū troops, who guarded\r\nSakaimachi gate, access to the grounds of the imperial palace. Offended by\r\nthis action they retired to their own territory. Seven of the most\r\nprominent court nobles (_kuges_)(301) who sympathized with Chōshū in his\r\naims and purposes accompanied them, and were thereupon deprived of their\r\nrank and revenue.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the Chōshū clansmen and the triumph of the shōgun’s party\r\nseemed to have put an end to the anti-foreign policy. The emperor and his\r\ncourt had been forced to the conclusion that the effort to expel the\r\ntreaty powers was far beyond the powers of Japan, even if it were united\r\nand its exertions directed from one centre. From this time may be\r\nestimated to begin a new phase in the contest which was to end in the\r\nrestoration of the original form of government.\r\n\r\nThe territory of Chōshū had become the rendezvous for all the disaffected\r\nelements of the empire. The daimyō was looked upon as the patriotic leader\r\nof the country, and _ronins_ from all parts hastened to enroll themselves\r\nunder his banner. In the summer of 1864 the Chōshū forces, to the number\r\nof several thousand, composed not only of the _samurai_ of the province,\r\nbut also of the disaffected _ronins_ who had gathered there, and of the\r\n“irregular troops,” _kiheitai_, which had been organized, started to\r\nre-enter Kyōto in order to regain the position they had previously\r\noccupied. The contest which followed has been described with lurid\r\ndistinctness by native annalists. They were encountered by Hitotsubashi in\r\ncommand of the troops of Aizu, Echizen, Hikoné, and other loyal clans.\r\nAfter a battle which lasted several days, and which raged chiefly about\r\nthe imperial palace, the Chōshū troops were completely defeated and forced\r\nto retire. It gives us an idea of the terrible earnestness of these\r\nJapanese warriors to read how a little remnant of the Chōshū troops took\r\nrefuge on Tennōzan; and when they heard their pursuers approaching, how\r\nseventeen of them committed _hara-kiri_(302); and lest their heads should\r\nbe recognized and their names disgraced, how they had thrown themselves\r\ninto the flames of a temple which they had set on fire. Three of the\r\ncompany who had performed the friendly act of decapitation for their\r\ncomrades had escaped by mountain roads and made their way back to Chōshū.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             Kido Takeyoshi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usual concomitant of fighting in a town had followed, and a great part\r\nof Kyōto had been destroyed by fire.(303) The Satsuma troops had taken an\r\nimportant part in this repulse of Chōshū. They had intervened at a very\r\ncritical moment, and had captured a considerable number of Chōshū\r\nprisoners. But they had treated them with great consideration, and\r\nsubsequently had even sent them home with presents, so that the Chōshū men\r\nfelt they really had friends instead of enemies in the warlike southern\r\nclan. It is in this battle we catch the first glimpse of the Chōshū\r\nleader, Kido Takeyoshi, then known as Katsura Kogorō.(304) He must have\r\nbeen about thirty-four years of age, and already gave promise of the\r\ntalents which made him one of the most conspicuous and influential\r\nstatesmen of the restoration.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Sir Harry Parkes arrived in Japan as the envoy plenipotentiary of\r\nthe British government. He had resided in China from boyhood, and had been\r\nespecially conspicuous in the war between China and Great Britain in 1860.\r\nHis career in Japan continued until 1883, when he was promoted to the\r\ncourt of Peking. He had the good fortune to be the representative of his\r\ncountry during the most momentous years of modern Japanese history, and in\r\nmany of the most important events he exerted an influence which was\r\ndecisive.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         Udaijin Iwakura Tomomi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe troubles in Chōshū were finally brought to a close. The efforts of the\r\nshōgun, although conducted at great expense, were unavailing. Satsuma,\r\nwhen summoned to render aid in crushing the rebellious prince, declined to\r\njoin in the campaign. Through the efforts of Saigō Kichinoske,(305) a\r\ntreaty of amity was effected between the two clans. The kind treatment of\r\nthe Chōshū prisoners in the attack on Kyōto was remembered, and the help\r\nand alliance of the powerful Kyūshū clan were eagerly accepted. Peace was\r\nnegotiated between the shōgun and the rebels. Thus the Chōshū episode was\r\nended, with no credit to the shōgun’s party, but with a distinct gain to\r\nthe cause of the imperial restoration.(306)\r\n\r\nIt had long been recognized that the treaties which had been made by the\r\nforeign powers would possess a greatly increased influence on the Japanese\r\npeople if they could have the sanction of the emperor. The shōgun Iemochi\r\nhad been summoned to Kyōto by the emperor to consult upon the concerns of\r\nthe nation, and was occupying his castle at Ōsaka. The representatives of\r\nthe foreign powers thereupon concluded that it would be a timely movement\r\nto proceed with their naval armaments to Hyōgo, and wait upon the shōgun\r\nat Ōsaka, with the purpose of urging him to obtain the imperial approval\r\nof the treaties. This was accordingly done, and an impressive display of\r\nthe allied fleets was made at the town, which has since been opened to\r\nforeign trade.\r\n\r\nThe shōgun was both young and irresolute, and personally had neither\r\nweight nor influence. But his guardian, Hitotsubashi, was a man of mature\r\nyears and judgment. He recognized the importance of obtaining the approval\r\nof the emperor to the foreign treaties, and of thus ending the long and\r\nruinous agitation which prevailed in the country.\r\n\r\nA memorial(307) was presented to the emperor in the name of the shōgun,\r\nsetting forth the embarrassment under which the administration of the\r\ncountry had been conducted on account of the supposed opposition of the\r\nemperor to the treaties, and begging him to relieve them by signifying his\r\nsanction; and assuring him that if this is not given, the foreign\r\nrepresentatives who are at Hyōgo will proceed to the capital and demand it\r\nat his hands.\r\n\r\nIt ended in the sanction of the treaties being signified October 23, 1865,\r\nby the following laconic decree(308) addressed to the shōgun: “The\r\nimperial consent is given to the treaties, and you will therefore\r\nundertake the necessary arrangements therewith.”\r\n\r\nDuring this critical time the Shōgun Iemochi died September 19, 1866, at\r\nhis castle in Ōsaka at the age of eighteen. He had been chosen in 1858, in\r\nthe absence of a regular heir, by the determined influence of Ii\r\nKamon-no-kami, who was then all-powerful at Yedo. He was too young to have\r\nany predominating influence upon affairs. Until the assassination of the\r\nprime minister Ii Kamon-no-kami in 1861 the boy shōgun had been under his\r\nguardianship. Since then that duty had been devolved upon Hitotsubashi, a\r\nson of the diamyō of Mito, who had been himself strongly pressed for the\r\noffice of shōgun, but who was alleged to be too mature and resolute a\r\ncharacter for the prime minister’s purposes. As guardian, Hitotsubashi had\r\ntaken an active part in the effort to obtain the sanction of the treaties,\r\nand the final success of this important step must in a great measure be\r\nattributed to him.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Iemochi without direct heirs, the office of shōgun was\r\noffered to Hitotsubashi as a representative of Mito, one of the “honorable\r\nfamilies” from whom a shōgun was to be chosen in case of a failure of\r\ndirect heirs. It is said that he accepted the office with great\r\nreluctance, knowing the troubles which would surely await him who assumed\r\nit. He assented only on the command of the emperor and the assurance of\r\nsupport from many of the diamyōs. He has thus the distinction of becoming\r\nthe last of the long line of Tokugawa shōguns, under the name of Tokugawa\r\nYoshinobu.(309)\r\n\r\nA few months after the death of Iemochi, on the 3d of February, 1867,\r\nEmperor Kōmei also died from an attack of small-pox. He is said to have\r\nbeen strongly prejudiced against foreigners and foreign intercourse, and\r\nit was claimed at the time of his death, that when he sanctioned the\r\nforeign treaties the divine nature left him to fall a prey to the ravages\r\nof ordinary disease. His son Mutsuhito, then in his fifteenth year,\r\nsucceeded him and is now the reigning emperor, the one hundred and\r\ntwenty-first of his line.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          The Reigning Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was thought that the death of an emperor of strong prejudices and of a\r\nmature age would naturally favor a more complete control by the new\r\nshōgun. It was not to be anticipated that an emperor, still only a youth,\r\nwould pursue the same policy as his father, and undertake to assume a real\r\nand active part in the government of his country. But the shōgun and his\r\nfriends underrated the influences which were gathered at Kyōto, and which\r\nnow went far beyond an anti-foreign sentiment and were chiefly concerned\r\nwith schemes for restoring the imperial power and unifying the form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe daimyō of Tosa, who was a man of liberal sentiments and of great\r\npenetration, addressed a letter to the shōgun in October, 1867, in which\r\nhe frankly says: “The cause [of our trouble] lies in the fact that the\r\nadministration proceeds from two centres, causing the empire’s eyes and\r\nears to be turned in two different directions. The march of events has\r\nbrought about a revolution, and the old system can no longer be persevered\r\nin. You should restore the governing power into the hands of the sovereign\r\nand so lay a foundation on which Japan may take its stand as the equal of\r\nother countries.”(310)\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             Imperial Crests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shōgun being deeply impressed with the wisdom of this advice drew up a\r\ndocument addressed to his vassals, asking their opinion of the\r\nadvisability of his resignation. Among other things he says: “It appears\r\nto me that the laws cannot be maintained in face of the daily extension of\r\nour foreign relations, unless the government be conducted by one head, and\r\nI propose therefore to surrender the whole governing power into the hands\r\nof the imperial court. This is the best I can do for the interests of the\r\nempire.”(311) According to this announced resolution, on the 19th of\r\nNovember, 1867, the shōgun resigned into the hands of the emperor his\r\nauthority. This surrender was accepted, and thus a dynasty which had\r\nlasted from 1603 came to an end. That this surrender might be declined and\r\nthe power still continue to be held by the Tokugawa, was perhaps the hope\r\nand wish of the last shōgun. But it was not to be. The powerful clans who\r\nfor years had labored for the destruction of the Tokugawa primacy were\r\nready to undertake the responsibility of a new government. And although\r\nthe change was not to be effected without a struggle, yet from this point\r\nmay be counted to begin the new period of the restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. THE RESTORED EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the shōgun was accepted by the emperor, on the\r\nunderstanding that a conference of the daimyōs was to be called and its\r\nopinion taken in reference to the subsequent conduct of affairs. In the\r\nmeantime the ex-shōgun, under the command of the emperor, was to continue\r\nthe administration, particularly of those interests which concerned the\r\nforeign powers. But the allied western daimyōs feared the effect of\r\nleaving the administration in the hands of their enemies. The possession\r\nof the person of the emperor was always reckoned an important advantage.\r\nEspecially was this the case when the emperor was only a boy, whose\r\ninfluence in the affairs of the government could have little weight. They\r\nresolved, therefore, to take measures which would definitely ensure the\r\ntermination of the shōgun’s power, and secure for themselves the result\r\nfor which they had been so long laboring.\r\n\r\nOn January 3, 1868, by a so-called order of the emperor,(312) but really\r\nby the agreement of the allied daimyōs, the troops of the Aizu clan, who\r\nwere in charge of the palace gates, were dismissed from their duty, and\r\ntheir place assumed by troops of the clans of Satsuma, Tosa, Aki, Owari,\r\nand Echizen. The _kugés_ who surrounded the court and who were favorable\r\nto the Tokugawa party were discharged and forbidden to enter its\r\nprecincts. The vacant places were filled by adherents of the new order of\r\nthings. The offices of _kwambaku_ and _shōgun_ were by imperial edict\r\nabolished. A provisional plan of administration was adopted and persons of\r\nadequate rank appointed to conduct the several departments. “A decree was\r\nissued announcing that the government of the country was henceforth solely\r\nin the hands of the imperial court.”(313)\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the new government was to recall the daimyō of\r\nChōshū, who had been expelled from Kyōto, in 1863, and to invite back the\r\n_kugés_ who had been exiled and deprived of their revenues and honors. The\r\nsentence of confiscation which had been pronounced upon them was abrogated\r\nand they were restored to their former privileges. One of them, Sanjo\r\nSaneyoshi, as prime minister spent the remainder of his life in reviving\r\nthe ancient and original form of government. The Chōshū troops who had\r\nbeen driven out of the capital in 1863, were recalled and given a share\r\nwith the loyal clans in guarding the palace of the emperor.\r\n\r\nThis powerful clan,(314) which had suffered such a varied experience, was\r\ndestined to take and maintain a leading position in the future development\r\nof the restored empire.\r\n\r\nThe Aizu and other clans which had been devoted friends of the Tokugawa\r\nshōguns were especially outraged by this conciliatory spirit shown to the\r\nChōshū troops. They claimed that this clan by resisting the imperial\r\ncommands had merited the opprobrious title of rebels (_chōtoki_), and were\r\nno longer fit for the association of loyal clans. But the Chōshū daimyō\r\nhad been restored to the favor of his emperor, and moreover was allied\r\nwith the clans whose power was paramount at Kyōto, so that the\r\ndisapprobation of the Tokugawa adherents had little terror for him.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of his friends the shōgun retired to his castle at\r\nŌsaka, and the troops attached to his cause also retreated and gathered\r\nunder his standard. The situation of affairs was for a time uncertain. The\r\nshōgun had resigned, and his resignation had been accepted, but he had\r\nbeen asked by the emperor to continue his administration. Subsequently,\r\nunder the pressure of the allied clans, the emperor had abolished the\r\nshōgunate and entrusted the administration to a provisional government.\r\nThis last action the friends of the ex-shōgun resented as the doings of\r\nrevolutionists. It is believed that he himself was averse to further\r\nconflict. Any step which he might take in the vindication of his rights\r\nmust involve war with the allied clans, and he was not a man of war.\r\n\r\nWhile these critical events were taking place, the representatives of\r\nforeign powers came down from Yedo to Hyōgo with an impressive array of\r\nmen-of-war. By invitation of the ex-shōgun they visited him at Ōsaka. In\r\nreply to the representatives he made an address,(315) complaining of the\r\narbitrary conduct of those who now had possession of the imperial person,\r\nand notifying them that he was willing and able to protect their rights\r\nunder the treaties, and asking them to await the action of a conference to\r\nbe summoned. In consequence of the conflict which was now imminent, the\r\nrepresentatives of the treaty powers issued a notice to their citizens\r\nthat neutrality must be maintained under all circumstances, and arms and\r\nammunition must not be sold to either party.\r\n\r\nThe first armed conflict between the two parties took place during the\r\nclosing days of January, 1868. Two of the allied daimyōs, Owari and\r\nEchizen, were sent to Ōsaka to confer with the ex-shōgun, in the hope that\r\nsome terms might be agreed upon, by which further difficulty could be\r\navoided. They were both Tokugawa daimyōs, Owari belonging to one of the\r\n_go-sanké_ families, and Echizen being a descendant of Ieyasu’s son. They\r\noffered to the ex-shōgun an honorable appointment, and if he would come to\r\nKyōto they assured him a ready audience before the emperor. He promised to\r\nobey the emperor’s command and visit the capital.\r\n\r\nAfter the envoys had gone his friends raised suspicions in his mind\r\nconcerning his personal safety. The daimyōs of Aizu and Kuwana offered to\r\naccompany him in case he determined to go. They organized, therefore, a\r\nforce of about 10,000 men with which they proposed to escort him. He must\r\nhave known that a formidable military escort like this would precipitate a\r\nconflict. However, he set out. The news of the preparations of the\r\nex-shōgun was brought to Kyōto, and aroused a determination to resist his\r\ninvasion of the capital. He had been invited to the palace by the emperor,\r\nbut he was to come as a peaceful visitor. If he had determined to come\r\nwith a guard composed of the enemies of the empire he must be resisted.\r\n\r\nTroops of the Satsuma and Chōshū clans were, therefore, posted to\r\nintercept the march of the ex-shōgun’s escort. It is believed that they\r\nnumbered about 1,500(316) men. The fighting took place on the roads\r\nleading from Ōsaka to Kyōto, and lasted during the 28th, 29th, and 30th of\r\nJanuary. It ended in the complete defeat of the rebel army, although it so\r\nfar outnumbered its adversaries.\r\n\r\nThe ex-shōgun being thus disappointed in his plan to enter the capital\r\nwith a commanding force retired to his castle at Ōsaka, from which he\r\nproceeded on a steam corvette to Yedo.(317) The castle at Ōsaka was burnt,\r\nand the defeated troops made their way by land to the same rendezvous. The\r\nantipathy existing between the Satsuma clan and the Tokugawa adherents\r\nshowed itself in a very pronounced manner in Yedo. The Satsuma _yashiki_,\r\nwhich was occupied by troops of that clan and by _ronins_ favorable to\r\nthem was surrounded by Tokugawa troops and burnt. Collisions between the\r\ntwo parties were of constant occurrence, which continued until the arrival\r\nof the imperial troops restored order. In Hyōgo too, which with Ōsaka was\r\nopened to foreign trade on the first of January, 1868, there were\r\ndifficulties between the foreigners and anti-foreign element in the\r\npopulation. But these troubles rapidly disappeared, because the new\r\ngovernment took pains at once to make it plain that the treaties with\r\nforeign powers were to be kept, and outrages committed against those who\r\nwere in the country under these treaties were not to be tolerated.\r\n\r\nOn February 8, 1868, the emperor sent to the foreign representatives a\r\nrequest that they communicate to their governments the fact that hereafter\r\nthe administration of both internal and external affairs would be\r\nconducted by him, and that officers would be appointed to conduct the\r\nbusiness which may arise under the foreign treaties.\r\n\r\nIn token of the sincerity of this communication an invitation was conveyed\r\nto the representatives of the powers then at Hyōgo to present themselves\r\nbefore the emperor on March 23d. The significance of this event can\r\nscarcely now be conceived. Never before in the history of the empire had\r\nits divine head deigned to admit to his presence the despised foreigner,\r\nor put himself on an equality with the sovereign of the foreigner. The\r\nevent created in the ancient capital the utmost excitement. The French and\r\nDutch ministers had each in turn been conducted to the palace and had been\r\nreceived in audience. No serious incident had occurred. But during the\r\nprogress of Sir Harry Parkes,(318) the British representative, from his\r\nlodgings to the palace, two fanatical _samurai_ rushed upon his escort,\r\nand before they could be overpowered wounded nine of them. One of the\r\nwould-be assassins was killed and the other was captured after being\r\ndesperately wounded. The party returned at once to the lodgings of the\r\nenvoy who fortunately was uninjured.\r\n\r\nThe court, by whose invitation the ministers had undertaken to present\r\nthemselves before the emperor, was overwhelmed with mortification. High\r\nofficers at once waited upon Sir Harry and tendered their sympathy and\r\nprofound regret. After making every reparation in their power,\r\narrangements were made to hold the audience on the day following that\r\noriginally appointed. It was held accordingly without further incident.\r\nWarned by this alarming occurrence, the government issued an edict, that\r\nas the treaties had now been sanctioned by the emperor, the protection of\r\nforeigners was henceforth his particular care; that if therefore any\r\n_samurai_ were to be guilty of an outrage against them, he should be\r\ndegraded from his rank, and denied the honorable privilege of committing\r\n_hara-kiri_; he should suffer the punishment of a common criminal and have\r\nhis head exposed in token of dishonor. Miyeda Shigeru, the surviving\r\nculprit, was thus punished.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the brief contest was now shifted to the east. The ex-shōgun\r\nseemed to vacillate between a complete surrender of his power and a\r\nprovisional retention of it until the will of the nation could be taken by\r\na conference of the daimyōs. On the arrival of the imperial forces in Yedo\r\nthe final terms of his future treatment were announced to the ex-shōgun:\r\nThat he retire to Mito, and there live in seclusion; that the castle in\r\nYedo be evacuated; and that the vessels and armaments now in the\r\npossession of the ex-shōgun be surrendered. These terms were accepted, and\r\nhe took up his residence in his ancestral province of Mito. Subsequently\r\nhe was permitted to remove to the castle of Sumpu at Shizuoka. With him\r\nthe dynasty of Tokugawa shōguns vanishes from history.\r\n\r\nHis adherents, however, still continued to resist the imperial forces. For\r\nmonths the Aizu troops hovered about Yedo, and at last came to blows with\r\nthe imperial troops at the grounds of the Uyeno temple on July 4, 1868. It\r\nwas a hard-fought battle, and was at last decided by an Armstrong gun in\r\nthe hands of the Hizen troops. The fine old temple was destroyed, and the\r\nrebel forces withdrew to the north.\r\n\r\nFurther complications arose—fighting at Utsunomiya, etc.,—but at last they\r\nwere ended by the surrender of the castle of Wakamatsu, where the daimyō\r\nof Aizu had made a stand. With generous fortitude he took the blame upon\r\nhimself and submitted to the clemency of his sovereign.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary now in order to bring to a close the account of this\r\nshort military contest, to refer to the movements of the fleet lying at\r\nShinagawa. It will be remembered that by the terms accepted by the\r\nex-shōgun these vessels were to be surrendered to the imperial forces.\r\nThere were seven of them, mounting in all eighty-three guns. They were\r\nunder the command of Enomoto Izumi-no-kami, who had learned in Holland the\r\nscience of naval war. He did not approve of his master surrendering these\r\nmuniments of war. On the morning of the day when the vessels were to be\r\ndelivered over to the imperial commander, they had disappeared from their\r\nanchorage. In the night Enomoto had got up steam, crept out through Yedo\r\nbay, and sailed northward to more friendly climes. The imperial fleet\r\nfollowed, and after some manœuvring at Sendai proceeded to Hakodate. Here\r\nthe warlike operations between the rebels and the imperial troops lasted\r\ntill July, 1869. Finally, the leaders, Enomoto and Matsudaira Tarō, seeing\r\nthat it was hopeless to contend longer against a constantly increasing\r\nenemy, offered to commit _hara-kiri_, in order that their followers might\r\nbe saved by a surrender. Their unselfish purpose was not, however,\r\npermitted. Then it was determined that the two leaders should give\r\nthemselves up to the besiegers, to save the rest. This was done. The\r\nprisoners were sent to Yedo, and their gallant conduct and heroic devotion\r\nto the cause of their prince were so keenly appreciated that they were all\r\npardoned.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were transpiring in the east and north, the work of\r\nestablishing a system of administration was proceeded with at Kyōto.\r\n\r\nA constitution was drawn up, detailing the various departments of the\r\ngovernment, and the duties of the officers in each. These departments\r\nwere: 1. Of supreme administration; 2. of the Shintō religion; 3. of home\r\naffairs; 4. of foreign affairs; 5. of war; 6. of finance; 7. of judicial\r\naffairs; 8. of legislative affairs. This scheme underwent several changes,\r\nand for a long time was regarded as only tentative.\r\n\r\nThe ablest men in the movements which were now in progress were afraid of\r\nthe traditions of indulgence and effeminacy which attached to the court at\r\nKyōto. In order to restore the government to a true and self-respecting\r\nbasis, it seemed necessary to cut loose from the centuries of seclusion in\r\nwhich the emperor had remained, and enter upon the work of governing the\r\nempire as a serious and solemn task. It was in this spirit that Ōkubo\r\nToshimichi of Satsuma, one of the ablest of the statesmen of the new era,\r\nmade in 1868 a novel and startling proposition. It was in a memorial(319)\r\naddressed by him to the emperor. He proposed that the emperor should\r\nabandon the traditions which had grown up respecting his person and his\r\ncourt, and rule his empire with personal supervision. To do this\r\nsuccessfully, he recommended that the capital be transferred from the\r\nplace of its degrading superstitions to a new home. He suggested that\r\nŌsaka be the place selected.\r\n\r\nIf the emperor’s court had been under the same influences as had governed\r\nit in past years, such a proposition would have been received with horror.\r\nPerhaps even the bold proposer would have been deemed fit for the ceremony\r\nof _hara-kiri_. But the men who surrounded the emperor belonged to a\r\ndifferent school, and the emperor himself, although he was still an\r\ninexperienced youth, had already begun to breathe the freer air of a new\r\nlife. The proposition was welcomed, and led to the great change which\r\nfollowed. After discussion and consideration it was determined that the\r\nemperor should make his residence not in Ōsaka, which would have been a\r\ngreat and impressive change, but in Yedo, where for two hundred and fifty\r\nyears the family of Ieyasu had wielded the destinies of the empire. By\r\nthis change more than any other was emphasized the fact that hereafter the\r\nexecutive as well as the ultimate power was to be found in the same\r\nimperial hands.\r\n\r\nActing on these principles the emperor followed his victorious army and,\r\nNovember 26, 1869, arrived at Yedo and took up his residence in the\r\ncastle. Reports were made to him of the complete settlement of all\r\ndifficulties in the north and the establishment of peace. In token of his\r\narrival the name of Yedo had been changed to Tōkyō(320) (eastern capital),\r\nby which name it has since been known. As a compensation to the\r\ndisappointed and disheartened citizens of Kyōto, their city received the\r\ncorresponding designation of Saikyō (western capital). The year-period,\r\nwhich from January, 1865, had borne the name of Keiō, had been changed to\r\n_Meiji_(321) (Enlightened Peace), and was fixed to begin from January,\r\n1868. Heretofore the year-periods had been changed whenever it seemed\r\ndesirable to mark a fortunate epoch. But by the edict establishing the\r\n_Meiji_ year-period, it was settled that hereafter an emperor was to make\r\nbut one change in the year-period during his reign.\r\n\r\nThe emperor returned to the western capital during the spring of 1869 for\r\na brief visit. The usual etiquette of mourning for his father required his\r\npresence at the imperial tomb. He also availed himself of this visit to\r\nwed the present empress, who was a princess of the house of Ichijō,(322)\r\none of the ancient families descended from the Fujiwara. He came back\r\nagain in April, but there was so much opposition on the part of the\r\ninhabitants of the ancient capital to the complete loss of their emperor,\r\nthat it was deemed most prudent for the newly married empress to remain\r\nbehind. She did not set out for Tōkyō to join her husband until the\r\nNovember following, where she arrived without incident.\r\n\r\nA surprising reminiscence of the Christianity which was supposed to have\r\nbeen extinguished in the seventeenth century came to light in 1865.\r\nSeveral Christian communities in the neighborhood of Nagasaki(323) were\r\ndiscovered, who had preserved their faith for more than two hundred years.\r\nWithout priests, without teachers, almost without any printed instruction,\r\nthey had kept alive by tradition through successive generations a\r\nknowledge of the religion which their ancestors had professed. These\r\ncommunities had no doubt maintained a discreet quiet as to the tenets of\r\ntheir belief. They had a traditional fear of the persecution to which\r\ntheir fathers had been subjected and sought by silence to remain\r\nundisturbed. It was the rejoicing at their discovery which directed the\r\nattention of the government to the fire which had been so long\r\nsmouldering.\r\n\r\nA new edict of the imperial government, displayed upon the public\r\nedict-boards in 1868, first called the notice of the foreign\r\nrepresentatives to the measures which were being taken.(324) It was as\r\nfollows: “The evil sect called Christian is strictly prohibited.\r\nSuspicious persons should be reported to the proper officers, and rewards\r\nwill be given.” Nearly all the ministers of foreign powers remonstrated\r\nagainst this proclamation, as throwing discredit on the religions of their\r\ncountries. The Japanese officials defended the punishment of Christians by\r\nalleging the national prejudice against them, which had come from the\r\npreceding centuries. They argued that the question was one of purely\r\ndomestic concern, of which foreign nations could have no adequate\r\nknowledge, and in which they had no right to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe Christians chiefly lived in Urakami, a village near Nagasaki. They\r\nwere said to number about four thousand. Orders were sent by the\r\ngovernment from Tōkyō in June, 1868, that all the families who would not\r\nrecant should be deported and put in the charge of daimyōs in different\r\nprovinces. Only a small part of the Christians were thus exiled. The\r\ngovernment probably dealt with greater leniency because they found the\r\ntreaty powers so deeply interested. Subsequently the measures taken\r\nagainst the native Christians were withdrawn. In March, 1872, those who\r\nhad been dispersed among the daimyōs were granted permission to return to\r\ntheir homes, and persecution for religious belief was ended forever.\r\n\r\nOn April 17, 1869, before his court and an assembly of daimyōs, the\r\nemperor took what has been called the charter oath(325) in five articles,\r\nin substance, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A deliberative assembly shall be formed, and all measures decided by\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\n2. The principles of social and political economics should be diligently\r\nstudied by both the superior and inferior classes of our people.\r\n\r\n3. Every one in the community shall be assisted to persevere in carrying\r\nout his will for all good purposes.\r\n\r\n4. All the absurd usages of former times should be disregarded, and the\r\nimpartiality and justice displayed in the workings of nature be adopted as\r\nthe basis of action.\r\n\r\n5. Wisdom and ability should be sought after in all quarters of the world\r\nfor the purpose of firmly establishing the foundations of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe promise in the first article to establish a deliberative assembly was\r\nwatched with the greatest solicitude. And when during the same year the\r\n_kogisho_(326) (parliament) was called together, great hopes were\r\nentertained of its usefulness. It was composed of persons representing\r\neach of the daimiates, who were chosen for the position by the daimyōs. It\r\nwas a quiet peaceful debating society,(327) whose function was to give\r\nadvice to the imperial government.\r\n\r\nThat it was a thoroughly conservative body is apparent from the result of\r\nits discussion upon several of the traditional customs of Japan. On the\r\nproposition to recommend the abolition of the privilege of _hara-kiri_ the\r\nvote stood: Ayes 3, noes 200, and not voting 6. On the proposition to\r\nabolish the wearing of swords, which was introduced and advocated by Mori\r\nArinori, the final vote was unanimously against it in a house of 213.(328)\r\nAfter a short and uneventful career the _kogisho_ was dissolved in the\r\nautumn of the same year in which it was summoned. It had been a step, but\r\nnot a very important step, in the direction of parliamentary government.\r\n\r\nWe must now give an account of the most remarkable event in the modern\r\nhistory of Japan. We refer to the termination of feudalism by the\r\nvoluntary surrender of their feudal rights on the part of the daimyōs.\r\nThis action was a logical consequence of the restoration of the executive\r\npower into the hands of the emperor. It was felt by the statesmen of this\r\nperiod that in order to secure a government which could grapple\r\nsuccessfully with the many questions which would press upon it, there must\r\nbe a centralization of the powers which were now distributed among the\r\npowerful daimyōs of the empire. To bring this about by force was\r\nimpossible. To discover among the princes a willingness to give up their\r\nhereditary privileges and come down to the position of a powerless\r\naristocracy was something for which we have hitherto looked in vain.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              Mori Arinori.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtless the _fainéant_ condition of nearly all the daimyōs at this time\r\nmade the accomplishment of this event more easy. With only a few\r\nexceptions, the hereditary princes of the provinces had come to be merely\r\nthe formal chiefs of their daimiates. The real power was in the hands of\r\nthe energetic and capable _samurai_, who were employed to manage the\r\naffairs. They saw that any scheme for transferring the political authority\r\nof the daimyōs to the central government would render more important their\r\nservices. They would become not merely the formal administrative\r\nfunctionaries, but the real officers to whom responsible duties and trusts\r\nwould be confided. Some of this class of subordinates had already in the\r\nnew imperial government tasted the savoriness of this kind of service, and\r\nthey were ready to carry out a plan which seemed to have patriotism and\r\npracticability in its favor.\r\n\r\nThe most notable circumstance in this series of events was the\r\npresentation to the emperor of an elaborate memorial signed by the daimyōs\r\nof Chōshū, Satsuma, Tosa, Hizen, Kaga, and others, offering him the lists\r\nof their possessions and men. This memorial(329) appeared in the official\r\ngazette March 5, 1869. Its preparation is attributed to Kido Takayoshi,\r\nand bears supreme evidence to his learning and statesmanship. With lofty\r\neloquence the memorial exclaims: “The place where we live is the emperor’s\r\nland, and the food which we eat is grown by the emperor’s men. How can we\r\nmake it our own? We now reverently offer up the lists of our possessions\r\nand men, with the prayer that the emperor will take good measures for\r\nrewarding those to whom reward is due and taking from those to whom\r\npunishment is due. Let the imperial orders be issued for altering and\r\nremodelling the territories of the various classes.... This is now the\r\nmost urgent duty of the emperor, as it is that of his servants and\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nThe example thus set by the most powerful and influential daimyōs was\r\nfollowed rapidly by others. Two hundred and forty-one(330) of the daimyōs\r\nunited in asking the emperor to take back their hereditary territories.\r\nAnd in the end only a small number remained who had not so petitioned.\r\nPrince Azuki in his memorial says: “1. Let them restore the territories\r\nwhich they have received from the emperor and return to a constitutional\r\nand undivided country. 2. Let them abandon their titles and under the name\r\nof _kwazoku_ (persons of honor) receive such properties as may serve for\r\ntheir wants. 3. Let the officers of the clans abandoning that title, call\r\nthemselves officers of the emperor, receiving property equal to that which\r\nthey have hitherto held.”\r\n\r\nIn response to these memorials a decree(331) was issued by the emperor\r\nAugust 7, 1869, announcing the abolition of the daimiates, and the\r\nrestoration of their revenues to the imperial treasury. It was also\r\ndecreed that the ranks of court nobles (_kugés_) and of daimyōs be\r\nabolished and the single rank of _kwazoku_ be substituted.\r\n\r\nThus at one stroke the whole institution of feudalism which had flourished\r\nfrom the time of Yoritomo was cut away. The government made provision for\r\nthe administration by creating prefectures (_ken_) to take the place of\r\ndaimiates. This was done in 1871. At first the daimyōs were appointed\r\ngovernors of the prefectures. But it was soon found that these hereditary\r\nprinces were as a class utterly unfit for the chief executive offices of\r\ntheir old provinces. Hence, one by one other competent persons were\r\nappointed to vacancies, until it came to be understood that competence and\r\nfitness were to be the requisite qualifications for such appointments.\r\n\r\nThe financial questions involved in the suppression of the feudal system\r\nwere serious and difficult. When the daimyōs surrendered their fiefs, they\r\ndid so with the understanding that they themselves should “receive such\r\nproperties as may serve their wants,”(332) and that the emperor should\r\ntake “measures for rewarding those to whom reward is due.”(333) It was\r\ndecided that each ex-daimyō, and each of the suzerains that were dependent\r\non him, should receive one tenth of the amount of their income from their\r\nfiefs. The ex-daimyōs received this amount free of any claims upon them\r\nfor the support of the non-productive _samurai_, who formed the standing\r\narmies of each clan. The central government assumed all the payments to\r\nthe _samurai_ for services of whatever kind. This heavy charge of the\r\ngovernment was met by borrowing $165,000,000,(334) which was added to the\r\nnational debt. With this sum they undertook to capitalize the pensions,\r\nwhich was finally accomplished by a compulsory enactment. Each claimant\r\nreceived from the government interest-bearing bonds for the amount of his\r\nincome reckoned at from five to fourteen years’ purchase according to its\r\nsum. Thus to the great relief of the country the matter of pensions was\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nTo many of the _samurai_ this summary settlement had unfortunate results.\r\nThe lump sums which they received were often soon consumed, and they were\r\nleft penniless and helpless. The traditions under which they had been\r\ntrained led them to look down upon labor and trade with disdain, and\r\nrendered them unfit to enter successfully on the careers of modern life.\r\nIn many cases worry and disappointment, and in others poverty and want,\r\nhave been the sequels which have closely followed the poor and obsolete\r\n_samurai._\r\n\r\nSeveral minor but noteworthy steps in reform were taken. The ancient\r\ndisqualifications of the _eta_ and _heimin_ were removed in 1871, and\r\nthese pariahs placed on the same legal footing as the rest of the\r\npopulation. The first railway in Japan was opened between Yokohama and\r\nTōkyō in 1872. The European calendar, so far as it regarded the beginning\r\nof the year and the beginning of the months, was adopted in 1873. The year\r\nwas still counted from Jimmu Tennō, 1873 of the Christian era\r\ncorresponding to 2533 of the Japanese era, and also by the _Meiji_\r\nyear-period, the commencement of which was from 1868.\r\n\r\nSeveral international events deserve notice here. A number of Ryūkyū\r\nislanders (vassals of Japan) had been shipwrecked on Formosa and some\r\nkilled by the semi-savage inhabitants. To punish this cruelty, and to\r\ninsure a more humane treatment in the future, the Japanese government sent\r\nan expedition under General Saigō Tsugumichi. They made short work of the\r\ninhuman tribes and enforced upon them the lesson of civility. China, who\r\nclaimed a sovereignty over this island, acknowledged the service Japan had\r\nrendered, and agreed to pay an indemnity for the expenses of the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nThe long-pending dispute between Russia and Japan concerning the boundary\r\nin Saghalien was settled in 1875 by a treaty(335) which exchanged the\r\nJapanese claims in Saghalien for the Kurile islands (Chishima).\r\n\r\nAn unexpected attack by the Koreans upon a Japanese steamer asking coal\r\nand provisions awakened an intense excitement in Japan. An expedition\r\nafter the pattern of Commodore Perry’s, under the command of General\r\nKuroda Kiyotaka, was despatched in January, 1876, to come to an\r\nunderstanding with the Koreans. The negotiations were entirely successful,\r\nand a treaty(336) of amity and commerce was concluded, and thus another of\r\nthe secluded kingdoms of the East had been brought into the comity of\r\nnations. Then outbreaks of this kind in Saga, in Higo, in Akizuki, and in\r\nChōshū occurred, but they were all put down without difficulty or delay.\r\nThe promptness with which the government dealt with these factions boded\r\nno good to the reactionary movements that were ready to break out in other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Satsuma clan had taken the most prominent part in the\r\ndestruction of the shōgunate and in the restoration of an imperial\r\ngovernment, there was in it a greater amount of conservatism and\r\nopposition to modern innovations than was to be found elsewhere. Indeed,\r\nthe clan had split into two distinct parties, the one aiding in all the\r\nreforms and changes which the government was attempting to carry out, the\r\nother holding resolutely to the old feudal traditions which they saw\r\nendangered by the present attitude of the emperor’s counsellors. The\r\nlatter party had for its leaders Shimazu Saburō and Saigō Takamori, both\r\nof whom had played conspicuous parts in the recent history of their\r\ncountry. The government had tried to conciliate these two influential men\r\nand to secure their co-operation in the administration. But both had\r\nretired from Tōkyō, and declined longer to share the responsibility of a\r\ncourse which they could not approve.\r\n\r\nSaigō, who was the idol of the _samurai_, after his retirement established\r\nnear Kagoshima a military school, where the young men of that class were\r\ndrilled in the duties of the army. Branch schools on the same model were\r\nalso carried on in several other places in the province. In all it was\r\nsaid that not less than 20,000 young _samurai_ were receiving a training\r\nin these dangerous schools. They were filled with the most violent\r\nantipathy to the government and were with difficulty restrained, even by\r\ntheir leaders, from outbreaks in sympathy with the uprisings which\r\nelsewhere were taking place.\r\n\r\nThe government was naturally solicitous concerning these collections of\r\ninflammable material. A collision with the students over the removal of\r\nsome stores of arms and ammunition, revealed their readiness to break into\r\nrebellion. It is not improbable that designing conspirators took advantage\r\nof the open and chivalric character of Saigō to push him into the\r\ninitiation of hostilities. Admiral Kawamura, himself a Satsuma man and a\r\nconnection of Saigō, was sent down to hold an interview with him and if\r\npossible to make a peaceful settlement. But the interview was declined.\r\nThe rebellious elements were at once gathered together, and Saigō, at the\r\nhead of a force of 14,000 men, started about the middle of February, 1877,\r\non his march up the west coast of Kyūshū, on his way to Tōkyō. The\r\nconspirators estimated that a force of 30,000 troops could be counted on\r\nto take part in the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe first impediment in their march was the castle of Kumamoto,(337) where\r\nthe government had a garrison of 2,000 to 3,000 men under General Tani.\r\nSaigō determined to reduce it before making further progress. He spent\r\nseveral weeks in this vain attempt. This was a precious delay for the\r\ngovernment, which it spent in organizing and sending forward troops for\r\nopposing the advance of the rebels. All available forces were collected\r\nand put in motion to the seat of war. Prince Arisugawa-no-miya was\r\nappointed commander-in-chief and established his headquarters at Fukuoka.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of troops at the seat of government was under the\r\nsupervision of General Saigō Tsugumichi, a younger brother of the rebel\r\nleader. Loyal as he was to his emperor, it was a painful task for him to\r\norganize war against his brother. With native delicacy he left to others\r\nthe duty of fighting on the field, and confined himself to the less\r\nconspicuous part of gathering and sending troops as they were needed.\r\n\r\nThe rebels had besieged Kumamoto and had already reduced it to great\r\nstraits. But the imperial forces came in time to its relief. There was\r\ndesperate fighting, but at last the besiegers were compelled to withdraw.\r\n\r\nThey retreated toward the east coast with the apparent purpose of seeking\r\na way to the north by Hyūga and Bungo. Promptly they were followed and\r\nconfined to a defensive attitude. The most desperate battles were fought\r\nin this part of the campaign. Though disappointed and outnumbered, the\r\nrebels fought with consummate bravery. They were almost in the shadow of\r\nthe mountains where their celestial ancestor was fabled to have descended\r\nupon the Japanese islands.(338) Their last stand was at Nobeoka in the\r\nnortheast corner of Hyūga. Their leaders realized that to continue the\r\ncontest would only cause unnecessary and hopeless slaughter.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Saigō saw that to end the fighting and save his\r\nfollowers he must leave them. Accordingly with about two hundred of those\r\nwho were personally devoted to him, he broke through the imperial line and\r\nescaped to Kagoshima. The army, finding they were forsaken, surrendered,\r\nAugust 19, 1877. Saigō, with his little band, entrenched himself on the\r\nsummit of the hill Shiroyama overlooking Kagoshima. Here he was surrounded\r\nby the imperial forces and bombarded night and day. The veteran leader was\r\nat last wounded in the thigh, and seeing that all hope of escape was gone,\r\nhe requested one of his lieutenants to perform for him the friendly office\r\nof severing his head from his body. After the capture of the stronghold,\r\nthe bodies of Saigō and his comrades were discovered. Admiral Kawamura\r\nhimself with tender hands washed the bloody head of his dead friend, and\r\nsaw that the bodies of all were decently buried. Thus, on September 24,\r\n1877, the last and most serious of the attempts which have been made to\r\ndisturb the empire in its new career came to an end.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one mournful sequel to this rebellion. Ōkubo\r\nToshimichi, a statesman and patriot of the purest type, had from the\r\nbeginning resisted the reactionary movements of his clan. At the time of\r\nthe rebellion he was minister of Home Affairs and put forth all his\r\nexertions to suppress it. A baseless slander that he had sent to Satsuma\r\nhired assassins to take Saigō’s life, had been used by the reckless\r\nconspirators to force the rebel leader to an outbreak. This was believed\r\nby many of the _samurai_, not only in Satsuma but in other provinces. On\r\nMay 14, 1878, Tōkyō was startled by the news that Ōkubo, while driving\r\nthrough a secluded spot in the old castle grounds, on his way to the\r\nemperor’s palace, had been murdered. The assassins were from the province\r\nof Kaga, and gave as the reason for their crime their desire to avenge the\r\ndeath of Saigō. Japan could ill afford to spare at this time her most\r\nclear-headed statesman and her noblest and most unflinching patriot.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                            Okubo Toshimichi.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat followed these important events must be told in a summary manner.\r\nThere was a powerful and growing party in the empire, who looked forward\r\nto a modification of the absolute form of government to which they had\r\nreturned in 1868. This party was particularly aggressive in the province\r\nof Tosa. They recalled to themselves and others the solemn pledge which\r\nthe emperor had given to his people in his charter oath,(339) when he\r\nannounced that “a deliberative assembly shall be formed, and all measures\r\ndecided by public opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe ruling minds in the government feared that the people were too\r\ninexperienced and too unaccustomed to deciding and acting for themselves\r\nto be entrusted with the grave duty of constitutional government. As a\r\npreparation for so important a step local assemblies were authorized and\r\nestablished in 1878. Matters referring to the government of each _fu_ and\r\n_ken_ were to be discussed, and to a certain extent decided in these\r\nassemblies. It was believed that the experience gained in such bodies\r\nwould go far towards preparing men for service in an imperial legislative\r\nbody. The expectations founded on these local assemblies were realized and\r\nin a fair degree they continued to fulfil their purpose.\r\n\r\nIn further pursuance of the plan of constitutional government, the\r\nemperor, on February 11, 1889, at his palace, promulgated a\r\nconstitution(340) for his people. In the presence of his cabinet and court\r\nhe took a solemn oath to govern under its limitations and powers. This\r\nconstitution contains seven chapters consisting of one hundred and eleven\r\narticles: Chapter I. The Emperor; II. Rights and Duties of Subjects; III.\r\nThe Imperial Diet; IV. The Ministers of State and Privy Council; V. The\r\nJudicature; VI. Finance; VII. Supplementary Rules. The emperor also\r\nannounced that the imperial diet would be convoked in the twenty-third\r\nyear of _Meiji_ (1890), and that the constitution would go into effect at\r\nthe date of its assembling.\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              Ito Hirobumi.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would seem that no great advance can be secured in Japan without the\r\nsacrifice of a valuable life. As Ii Kamon-no-kami was murdered in 1860,\r\nand as Ōkubo fell by the assassin’s hand at the close of the Satsuma\r\nrebellion, so now on the very day when the emperor was to promulgate this\r\nliberal constitution, Viscount Mori Arinori fell a victim to the fanatical\r\nhatred of one who looked with distrust upon the progress which his country\r\nwas making. No one could look, or did look, on this progress with more\r\ninterest than Mori. He had so long and so earnestly advocated a liberal\r\nand tolerant policy in the councils of his country, and had been a leader\r\nin all that was high and noble, that we cannot regard, except with\r\nprofound regret, his untimely death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.

LAWS OF SHŌTOKU TAISHI.(344)\r\n\r\n\r\n[From _Dai Nihonshi_, vol. xii., folio 28 to 31.]\r\n\r\nI.—Harmony shall be esteemed and obedience shall be held in regard.\r\nBecause dissensions prevail, therefore men are often unfaithful to their\r\nprince and disobedient to their fathers. Let adjoining districts be left\r\nin peace, thus harmony between superior and inferior shall be cultivated\r\nand co-operation in matters of state shall be promoted, and thus the right\r\nreason of all things may be reached and the right thing accomplished.\r\n\r\nII.—Let bountiful honor be always paid to the three precious elements of\r\nBuddhism, that is, to its priests, its ritual, and its founder. It is the\r\nhighest religion in the universe, and all people in all generations must\r\npay becoming reverence to its doctrines. Do not harshly censure men’s\r\nwickedness but teach them faithfully until they yield obedience. Unless\r\nmen rely upon Buddhism there is no way to convert them from the wrong to\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nIII.—To the commands of the Emperor men must be duly obedient. The prince\r\nmust be looked upon as the heaven and his subjects as the earth. The earth\r\ncontains all things and the heaven stretches over it. The four seasons\r\npass orderly along and the spirit of the universe is harmonious. If the\r\nearth were to cover the heaven the effect would be distraction. Hence the\r\nprince must command and the subject obey; superiors must act and inferiors\r\nyield. Men ought therefore to pay due heed to the orders of the Emperor;\r\nif not they will bring ruin on themselves.\r\n\r\nIV.—Politeness must be the chief rule of conduct for all officers and\r\ntheir colleagues in the court. The first principle governing subjects must\r\nbe politeness. When superiors are not polite then inferiors will not keep\r\nin the right; when inferiors are not polite their conduct degenerates into\r\ncrime. When both prince and subjects are polite, then social order is\r\nnever disturbed and the state is kept in a condition of tranquillity.\r\n\r\nV.—Covetousness and rapacity must be expelled from the hearts of officers,\r\nand they must adjudicate with just discrimination in all suits that come\r\nbefore them. Even in a single day there are thousands of such suits, and\r\nin the course of years how great must be the accumulation! If the suit is\r\nwon through bribery, then the poor man can obtain no justice but only the\r\nrich. The poor man will have no sure place of dependence, and subjects\r\nwill be driven to abandon their duty.\r\n\r\nVI.—To punish vice and to encourage virtue is the rule in good ancient\r\nlaw. The virtuous man must therefore be promoted, and the vicious man must\r\nbe surely punished. The man who is untruthful is a powerful instrument to\r\nendanger the state and a keen weapon to destroy the nation. The flatterer\r\nloves to tell the faults of the inferior to the superior, and also to\r\ndisclose the errors of the superior to the inferior. Such men are alike\r\nunfaithful to the prince and unfriendly to fellow citizens, and in the end\r\nfail not to stir up social disorder.\r\n\r\nVII.—The duty of men in the government must be assigned according to their\r\ncapacity. When intelligent men take service the applause of the people\r\nfollows, but when bad men are in office calamities ensue. If wise officers\r\nare put on duty the matters of state are well managed, and the community\r\nis free from danger and prosperity prevails. Therefore in ancient times\r\nthe wise king never selected the office for the man, but always selected\r\nthe man to suit the office.\r\n\r\nVIII.—Too often officers and their colleagues come early to their offices\r\nand retire soon; so that the public work accomplished in a single day is\r\nsmall. It is incumbent on them to devote sufficient time to their tasks;\r\nif not, then the work of the government cannot be done.\r\n\r\nIX.—Everything must be faithfully done, because fidelity is the origin of\r\njustice. The distinction between good and bad, between success and\r\nfailure, depends on fidelity. When both prince and subjects are faithful\r\nthen there are no duties which cannot be accomplished, but when both are\r\nunfaithful nothing can be done.\r\n\r\nX.—Give up all thoughts of indignation and be not angered with others on\r\naccount of a disagreement of opinion. Each one may have a different point\r\nof view and may therefore come to a different conclusion. If the one side\r\nbe right then the other must be wrong, or the cases may be just reversed.\r\nIt would be unjust to set down one man as surely wise and another as\r\npositively stupid; because men cannot attain perfection in their\r\ncharacters. It is impossible to decide either side to be perfectly right\r\nor perfectly wrong. While you are angry with another who has a different\r\nview from you, you cannot be sure lest you be in the wrong. Therefore\r\nthough you may think yourself in the right, it is safer to follow the\r\nopinions of the many.\r\n\r\nXI.—Let merit and demerit be carefully considered, and let rewards and\r\npunishments be meted out accordingly. In times past this has often failed\r\nto be justly done. It is incumbent on all who are entrusted with the\r\ndirection of public affairs and on all officers of the government to look\r\ncarefully after the distribution of rewards and punishments.\r\n\r\nXII.—Governors of provinces and their deputies must be careful not to\r\nimpose too heavy duties on their subjects. One state never has more than\r\none prince, and in like manner the subjects cannot have more than one\r\nmaster. The prince is the head of all his dominions and of all his\r\nsubjects. The officers of government are also the subjects of the prince;\r\nand there is no reason why they should dare to lay undue burdens upon\r\nothers who are subjects of the same prince.\r\n\r\nXIII.—Each officer of the government has his appointed duty. Sometimes\r\nofficers complain of the stagnation of business, which, however, is caused\r\nby their own absence from their appointed duties. They must not make a\r\npretence of the performance of their duties, and by their neglect\r\ninterrupt public affairs.\r\n\r\nXIV.—Subjects and officers must not be jealous of each other. If one\r\nperson is envious of another, the second is sure to be envious of the\r\nfirst. Thus the evils of jealousy never end. If men shall envy each other\r\non account of their talent and wisdom, no single wise man would ever be\r\nobtained for government service through a thousand years. What a noble\r\nmethod of governing a state would that be which expelled from its service\r\nall wise men!\r\n\r\nXV.—To sacrifice private interests for the public good is the duty of the\r\nsubject. When men are selfish there must be ill-will; when ill-will comes,\r\nthen with it must come iniquity, which will disturb the public welfare.\r\nIll-will is sure to bring about the breaking of wholesome rules and the\r\nviolation of the laws of the state. It is for this reason that the harmony\r\nbetween superior and inferior spoken of in the first article is so\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nXVI.—To select a convenient season in which to employ men for public work\r\nis the rule of good ancient law. Winter is a time of leisure; but during\r\nthe season between spring and autumn, in which they are employed on their\r\nfarms and in feeding silk-worms, it is not expedient to take men from\r\ntheir work, or interfere with them in their efforts to supply food and\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nXVII.—Important matters should only be settled after due conference with\r\nmany men. Trifling matters may be decided without conference, because they\r\nare not so material in their effects; but weighty matters, on account of\r\ntheir far-reaching consequences, must be discussed with many councillors.\r\nIt is thus that the right way shall be found and pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n_    1 The Book of Ser Marco Polo, the Venetian_; translated by Colonel\r\n      Henry Yule, C.B.

In the\r\n      successive issues of the _Résumé Statistique_, published by the\r\n      Statistical Bureau, the term Nippon is used to designate the\r\n      principal island.

The town\r\n      of Shimoda, which had been opened as a port for foreign trade was\r\n      almost destroyed, and the Russian frigate _Diana_ which was lying\r\n      there was so injured that she had to be abandoned.

Satow and Hawes’\r\n      _Handbook_, p. 338.\r\n\r\n  118 The title of shōgun is said to have been created by the Emperor\r\n      Sujin, who divided the empire into four military divisions, each\r\n      commanded by a shōgun or general. When Yoshinaka assumed control in\r\n      Kyōto at the time of his victory he was appointed _sei-i-shōgun_\r\n      (barbarian compelling general). Subsequently Yoritomo secured the\r\n      supreme military authority and having resigned the civil offices\r\n      held by him he was appointed by imperial edict _sei-i-tai-shōgun_ or\r\n      great barbarian compelling general.\r\n\r\n      See G. Appert’s _Ancien Japon_, vol. iii., p. 84; also Satow’s note\r\n      to Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. i., p. 42.\r\n\r\n  119 Adams, in his _History of Japan_, vol. i., p. 37, gives a quaint\r\n      quotation from _Nihon-Gwaishi_ as follows: “The crimes of the Heishi\r\n      against the imperial family were atoned for by their services, and\r\n      heaven therefore would not cut off their posterity. And this\r\n      probably was right.”\r\n\r\n  120 See Satow and Hawes’ _Handbook_, p. 57.\r\n\r\n  121 There are almost as many legends current concerning Benkei as his\r\n      master. Their first encounter was upon the Gojō bridge in Kyōto,\r\n      where Benkei prowled for the purpose of robbing passengers.\r\n      Yoshitsuné, then only a youth of sixteen years, displayed so much\r\n      agility and swordsmanship that the veteran robber yielded to him,\r\n      and ever after followed him as his faithful body servant. The\r\n      _Japanese Fairy World_, by W. E. Griffis, contains the legend of\r\n      Benkei stealing a huge bell five feet high from the monastery at\r\n      Miidera, and carrying it on his shoulders to Hiyēsan (see p. 93).\r\n      When Yoshitsuné was compelled to flee from the vengeance of his\r\n      brother, he came with Benkei, both disguised as begging priests, to\r\n      a guarded barrier. The custodians refused them passage, but Benkei,\r\n      who was cunning as well as strong, pulled out from his bosom a roll\r\n      of blank paper and pretended to read a commission from the abbot of\r\n      Hōkōji, in Kyōto, authorizing the two travellers to collect funds\r\n      throughout the country for casting a great bell for their temple.\r\n      The custodians were deeply impressed with this holy message and\r\n      allowed the travellers to pass without further question.\r\n\r\n  122 There are many legends, existing among the Ainos, of Yoshitsuné\r\n      having lived among them and taught them improved arts of hunting and\r\n      fishing. There is a wooden image of him at the village of Upper\r\n      Piratori, which is saluted (not worshipped) in token of honor to his\r\n      memory. Rev. John Batchelor, who has lived as a missionary among the\r\n      Ainos many years, is of the opinion that this reverence is largely\r\n      due to a desire on the part of the Ainos to conciliate their\r\n      Japanese masters. It has seemed not unreasonable to suppose that the\r\n      traditions concerning Yoshitsuné among the Ainos have been carried\r\n      from the Main island by the retreating tribes, and that Yoshitsuné\r\n      never lived with them in Yezo, but was only familiar with them in\r\n      the wild regions of Mutsu and Dewa.\r\n\r\n      See paper by Rev. J. Batchelor, _Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol.\r\n      xvi., part 1, p. 20.\r\n\r\n  123 Ōye-no-Hiromoto was a powerful adherent of Yoritomo, and was a\r\n      member of his administrative council. He was the ancestor of the\r\n      Mōri family, who afterward became famous as the daimyōs of Chōshū.\r\n\r\n  124 We owe to Kaempfer, perhaps, the erroneous notion which has been\r\n      repeated by subsequent writers that there was both an ecclesiastical\r\n      and a temporal emperor. This was never true. There has been only one\r\n      emperor, who, in the Japanese theory, was the direct descendant of\r\n      divine ancestors and who has always been the supreme authority. From\r\n      the time of Yoritomo, however, the administration was in the hand of\r\n      an hereditary shōgun who always received the commission of the\r\n      emperor for the performance of his duties. See Kaempfer’s _Histoire\r\n      de l’Empire du Japon_, vol. i., p. 182.\r\n\r\n  125 The Japanese term is _Shikken_, which is usually translated\r\n      _regent_.\r\n\r\n  126 A travelling palanquin.\r\n\r\n  127 See _Travels of Marco Polo_, second edition, London, 1875, vol. ii.,\r\n      p. 240.\r\n\r\n  128 In the year A.D. 1890 two pictures were brought to light which\r\n      represent the events of this memorable battle. They are believed to\r\n      have been painted about A.D. 1294 by Naganori and Nagatoki, painters\r\n      of the Tosa school. They have been in the family of one of the\r\n      captains in the Japanese army of that day, and while the figures of\r\n      the men and horses are not well drawn the pictures in other respects\r\n      have great historical value. Alongside of the scenes represented,\r\n      legends are written in explanation. It is said that these valuable\r\n      historical pictures are likely to come into the Household Department\r\n      and thus be more carefully preserved than they are likely to be in a\r\n      private house.—_Japan Weekly Mail_, 1890, p. 581.\r\n\r\n  129 For a description of this locality, which is justly famed in\r\n      Japanese annals, see Satow and Hawes’ _Handbook_, p. 56.\r\n\r\n  130 See Chamberlain’s _Handbook_, 1891, p. 337.\r\n\r\n  131 Quite an animated and interesting controversy took place a few years\r\n      ago with reference to this suicide of Kusunoki. Popular opinion\r\n      strongly justifies the act and rewards with its highest approval the\r\n      memory of the patriot. But Mr. Fukuzawa, one of the most radical of\r\n      the public men of to-day and an active and trenchant writer,\r\n      condemned the act as indefensible and cowardly.\r\n\r\n  132 Mr. Griffis says that when he resided in Fukui in A.D. 1871—more\r\n      than five hundred years after the event,—he saw the grave of the\r\n      heroic Nitta almost daily strewed with flowers.—_The Mikado’s\r\n      Empire_, 1876, p. 190.\r\n\r\n  133 Satow and Hawes’ _Handbook_, p. 356.\r\n\r\n  134 It is an evidence of the feeling which still exists towards the\r\n      Ashikaga shōguns that in 1863 these figures were taken from the\r\n      Tō-ji-in and beheaded and the heads pilloried in the dry bed of the\r\n      Kamogawa, at the spot where it is customary to expose the heads of\r\n      the worst criminals. Several of the men who were guilty of this\r\n      outrage were captured and were put into the hands of various daimyōs\r\n      by whom they were kept as prisoners.—Satow and Hawes’ _Handbook_, p.\r\n      357.\r\n\r\n  135 See the full account of tea ceremonies in Chamberlain’s _Things\r\n      Japanese_, 1892, p. 404.\r\n\r\n  136 The official list of emperors will be found in Appendix I.

M. von Brandt\r\n      as quoted in Rein’s _Japan_, p. 261.\r\n\r\n  139 Mr. W. A. Woolley, in a paper read before the Asiatic Society of\r\n      Japan, gives an account derived from Japanese sources as follows:\r\n      “Amongst those who landed on this occasion was one of the _Literati_\r\n      of China, who acted as interpreter between the foreigners and the\r\n      chief of the island Hyōbu-no-jō Tokitada. [Since both the Chinese\r\n      and Japanese used the same ideographic characters, they could\r\n      understand each other’s writing but not speech.] In reply to\r\n      questions the interpreter is represented as having described his\r\n      friends the foreigners as being ignorant of etiquette and\r\n      characters, of the use of wine cups and chop sticks, and as being,\r\n      in fact, little better than the beasts of the field. The chief of\r\n      the foreigners taught Tokitada the use of firearms, and upon leaving\r\n      presented him with three guns and ammunition, which were forwarded\r\n      to Shimazu Yoshihisa, and through him to the shōgun.”—_Asiatic\r\n      Society Transactions_, vol. ix., p. 128.\r\n\r\n  140 See _Adventures of Mendez Pinto_, done into English by Henry Cogan,\r\n      London, 1891, pp. 259 etc.\r\n\r\n  141 Hildreth’s _Japan_, etc., 1855, p. 27, note.\r\n\r\n_  142 Adventures of Mendez Pinto_, p. 281.\r\n\r\n  143 This is the name by which Pinto calls this city (see _Adventures of\r\n      Mendez Pinto_, London, 1891, p. 265); the real name, however, at\r\n      this time was Fumai, and is now Ōita.\r\n\r\n  144 The author himself saw in Japan in 1874 the native hunters using an\r\n      old-fashioned matchlock, in which the powder was fired by a slow\r\n      burning match, which was brought down to the powder by a trigger.\r\n      This kind of firearm, which was in use in Europe in the fifteenth\r\n      century, was taken to Japan by the Portuguese, and continued to be\r\n      used there until the re-organization of the army introduced the\r\n      modern form of gun.\r\n\r\n  145 In the accounts given by the biographers of Xavier, it is said that\r\n      there were two companions of Anjiro who in the subsequent baptism\r\n      received the names of John and Anthony.\r\n\r\n  146 This was the name of the seminary in Goa where Anjiro had been\r\n      educated.\r\n\r\n  147 See Coleridge’s _Life and Letters of St. Francis Xavier_, London,\r\n      1872, p. 237.\r\n\r\n  148 Bouhour’s _Life of Xavier_, p. 274.\r\n\r\n  149 In the _Life of St. Francis Xavier_ by Bartholi and Maffei the\r\n      following circumstance is given: “It seems that a rat had invaded\r\n      the sanctuary and gnawed the ornaments of the altar. The sacristan\r\n      appealed to the saint thus: ‘Father Francis! people say that you\r\n      passed from this life in the vicinity of China; that you were a\r\n      saint, that your body still remains entire and incorrupt at Goa. Now\r\n      here am I your sacristan; and I ask is it consistent with your honor\r\n      that a rat should have the audacity to gnaw the ornaments of your\r\n      altar? I demand his death at your hand.’ On opening the door of the\r\n      sanctuary the next morning the sacristan found the culprit quite\r\n      dead.”\r\n\r\n  150 See Woolley, “Historical Notes on Nagasaki”, _Asiatic Society\r\n      Transactions_, vol. ix., p. 129.\r\n\r\n  151 For these facts concerning Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, and the condition\r\n      of the country during their times, the author is largely indebted to\r\n      the _Life of Toyotomi Hideyoshi_, by Walter Dening, Tokio, 1890.\r\n\r\n  152 The word _daimyō_ means _great name_, and was used in reference to\r\n      the ownership of land; _shomyō_ means _small name_, and was at first\r\n      employed to indicate the small land-owner. But the word never\r\n      obtained currency, the small land-owner always preferring to call\r\n      himself a daimyō. See Chamberlain’s _Things Japanese_, p. 84.\r\n\r\n  153 The element of comedy shows itself from the beginning in Hideyoshi’s\r\n      character when he adopted the calabash, in which he had carried\r\n      water, as his symbol of victory. He added a new one for each\r\n      victory, and at last adopted a bunch of calabashes for his\r\n      coat-of-arms. Afterwards he had this constructed of gold, which was\r\n      carried as the emblem of his triumphant career.\r\n\r\n  154 See Dening’s _Life of Hideyoshi_, p. 207.\r\n\r\n  155 In Chamberlain’s _Things Japanese_ the estimate is given that at\r\n      this most prosperous time the number of Japanese professing\r\n      Christianity was not less than six hundred thousand, p. 297.\r\n\r\n  156 See the letter which the ambassador from the Prince of Bungo\r\n      presented on this occasion.

But Nobunaga and Hideyoshi were no more\r\n      usurpers than the Tokugawas, who succeeded them by force of arms.\r\n\r\n  158 Mr. Satow with rare literary insight has identified this Kuroda with\r\n      the Condera Combiendono of the Jesuit fathers. _Asiatic Society\r\n      Transactions_, vol. vii., p. 151.\r\n\r\n  159 See Shiga’s _History of Nations_, Tōkyō, 1888, p. 128.\r\n\r\n  160 Dening’s _Life of Toyotomi Hideyoshi_, p. 274.\r\n\r\n  161 See Dening’s _Life of Toyotomi Hideyoshi_, p. 278.\r\n\r\n  162 See p. 189.\r\n\r\n  163 His original name was Nakamura Hyoshi, the family taking its name\r\n      from the village where he was born. Then at his induction to manhood\r\n      A.D. 1553 his name was changed to Tokichi Takayoshi. At another turn\r\n      in his career he became Kinoshita Tokichi Takayoshi. In the year\r\n      A.D. 1562 he received permission to use the name Hideyoshi instead\r\n      of Tokichi, and A.D. 1575 his name was again changed to Hashiba,\r\n      which the Jesuit fathers wrote Faxiba.\r\n\r\n  164 See Satow and Hawes’ _Handbook_, p. 341.\r\n\r\n  165 The facts here related concerning this most interesting episode in\r\n      the life of Hideyoshi are chiefly taken from a paper furnished by\r\n      Mr. J. H. Gubbins to the _Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol. viii.,\r\n      p. 92.\r\n\r\n  166 The Emperor Ōgimachi retired from the throne A.D. 1586, and was\r\n      succeeded by Go-Yojō, then sixteen years old. It shows of how small\r\n      account the emperors had become, that this change in the head of the\r\n      nation is scarcely mentioned in the histories of the time.\r\n\r\n  167 The spies and guides employed by Hideyoshi were priests of the Shin\r\n      sect of Buddhists, who after the fall of Kagoshima were discovered\r\n      and crucified. A decree was also issued that every inhabitant of\r\n      Satsuma who was connected with this sect must renounce his creed. To\r\n      this day there exists among the people of Satsuma a general\r\n      hostility to the Buddhists which can be traced to this trying\r\n      episode.

It is not\r\n      improbable that some of the improved breeds, now seen in the\r\n      southern provinces, owe their origin to these valuable horses sent\r\n      over as presents.\r\n\r\n  172 See Chamberlain’s _Things Japanese_, 1892, p. 298, note.

See Dening’s _Life of Toyotomi Hideyoshi_, p.\r\n      156.\r\n\r\n  197 Kiyomasa was a bitter enemy of the Christians, owing no doubt to the\r\n      rivalry and antagonism which had sprung up with Konishi, who was a\r\n      Christian, in the Korean war. He is termed Toronosqui by the Jesuit\r\n      fathers from a personal name Toronosuke which he bore in his youth,\r\n      and he is characterized as “_vir ter execrandus_,” on account of his\r\n      persecution of the Christians in his province. Perhaps on account of\r\n      this fierce opposition he was greatly admired by the Buddhists, and\r\n      is worshipped under the name of Seishōkō by the Nichiren sect at a\r\n      shrine in the temple of Hommonji at Ikegami. Another monument to his\r\n      memory is the Castle of Kumamoto, which he built and which still\r\n      stands as one of the best existing specimens of the feudal castles\r\n      of Japan. As an evidence of its substantial character, in A.D. 1877,\r\n      under the command of General Tani, it withstood the siege of the\r\n      Satsuma rebels and gave the government time to bring troops to crush\r\n      the rebellion.\r\n\r\n  198 The plural of this word is here and elsewhere used in its English\r\n      form, although no such plural is found in Japanese.\r\n\r\n_  199 Ancien Japon_, par G.

And when the\r\n      Hollander challenged an exhibition of such power, the missionary\r\n      undertook to walk on the surface of the sea. A day was appointed.\r\n      The Spaniard prepared himself by confession, prayer, and fasting. A\r\n      great crowd of the Japanese assembled to see the miracle, and the\r\n      friar, after a confident exhortation to the multitude, stepped,\r\n      crucifix in hand, into the water. But he was soon floundering over\r\n      his head, and was only saved from drowning by some boats sent to his\r\n      assistance.—Hildreth’s _Japan_, etc., p. 140.\r\n\r\n  208 “This will seem to you less strange, if you consider how the Apostle\r\n      St. Paul commands us to obey even secular superiors and gentiles as\r\n      Christ himself, from whom all well-ordered authority is derived: for\r\n      thus he writes to the Ephesians (vii. 5): ‘be obedient to them that\r\n      are your temporal lords according to the flesh, with fear and\r\n      trembling in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ; not seeming\r\n      to the eye, as it were pleasing men, but as the servants of Christ\r\n      doing the will of God from the heart, with a good will seeming as to\r\n      the Lord and not to men.’ ”\r\n\r\n      The above is an extract from an Epistle of St. Ignatius, the 26th of\r\n      March, 1553, which is still regarded as authoritative and is read\r\n      every month to each of the houses. It was supplied to me by Dr. Carl\r\n      Meyer and verified by Rev. D. H. Buel, S. J. of St. Francis Xavier’s\r\n      College, New York City. Dr. Meyer has also pointed out that the\r\n      Second General Congregation, 1565, severely forbids any Jesuit to\r\n      act as confessor or theologian to a prince longer than one or two\r\n      years, and gives the minutest instructions to prevent a priest from\r\n      interfering in any way with political and secular affairs in such a\r\n      position.\r\n\r\n  209 This edict of Ieyasu is given by Mr. Satow in his contributions to\r\n      the debate on Mr. Gubbins’ _Review of the Introduction of\r\n      Christianity into China and Japan_.

Mr. Gubbins and Mr. Woolley had access to Japanese\r\n      authorities, and we have in their papers been enabled to see this\r\n      bloody episode for the first time from a Japanese standpoint. Dr.\r\n      Geerts has rendered an invaluable service in giving us translations\r\n      of letters written by Koeckebacker, the head of the Dutch factory\r\n      during the events, which show us how this insurrection was regarded\r\n      by the Dutch East India Company.\r\n\r\n  217 A _rônin_ was a retainer who had given up the service of his feudal\r\n      master, and for the time being was his own master.\r\n\r\n  218 See Dr. Geerts’ paper, _Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol. xi., p.\r\n      75.\r\n\r\n  219 The ships in use at this time among the Japanese were far less\r\n      seaworthy than those of European nations. The accompanying figures\r\n      given by Charlevoix, although probably somewhat fanciful, show the\r\n      impractical character of the vessels of that time.\r\n\r\n  220 See Dr. Geerts’ paper, _Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol. xi., p.\r\n      111.\r\n\r\n  221 Mr. Koeckebacker says: “The rebels counted in all, young and old, as\r\n      it was said, about forty thousand. They were all killed except one\r\n      of the four principal leaders, being an artist who formerly used to\r\n      gain his livelihood by making idols. This man was kept alive and\r\n      sent to Yedo.”—Dr. Geerts’ paper, _Asiatic Society Transactions_,\r\n      vol. xi., part 1, p. 107.\r\n\r\n      There is a tradition that a number of the prisoners who were\r\n      captured at this castle were hurled down from the rocks of the\r\n      island now called Papenberg in Nagasaki harbor. But Dr. Geerts\r\n      ridicules this notion and says: “A little local knowledge would show\r\n      it to be impossible to throw people from the rocks on Papenberg into\r\n      the sea, as the rocks are by no means steep bluffs, but possess an\r\n      inclined shape and a shore. A little knowledge of the Dutch language\r\n      would further show that the name Papenberg means ‘mountain of the\r\n      priest,’ in allusion to the shape of a Roman Catholic priest’s cap\r\n      or bonnet.”—_Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol. xi., part 1, p.\r\n      115.\r\n\r\n  222 See Dr. Geerts’ paper, _Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol. xi.,\r\n      part 1, pp. 110 and 111.\r\n\r\n  223 A Japanese writer thus sums up the result of the effort to introduce\r\n      Christianity into his country: “After nearly a hundred years of\r\n      Christianity and foreign intercourse, the only apparent results of\r\n      this contact with another religion and civilization were the\r\n      adoption of gunpowder and firearms as weapons, the use of tobacco\r\n      and the habit of smoking, the making of sponge-cake, the\r\n      naturalization into the language of a few foreign words, and the\r\n      introduction of new and strange forms of disease.”—Shigetaka Shiga’s\r\n      _History of Nations_, Tōkyō, 1888. The words introduced into the\r\n      language from the Portuguese, except several derived from\r\n      Christianity, are as follows: _tabako_, tobacco; _pan_ (_pāo_),\r\n      bread; _kasutera_ (from Castilla), sponge-cake; _tanto_, much;\r\n      _kappa_ (_capa_), a waterproof; _kappu_ (_copa_), a cup or wine\r\n      glass; _birōdo_ (_vellendo_), velvet; _biidoro_ (_vidro_),\r\n      glass.—Rein’s _Japan_, p. 312.\r\n\r\n  224 See Mr. Satow’s contributions to the discussion of Mr. Gubbins’\r\n      paper, _Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol. vi., part 1, p. 61; also\r\n      Satow and Hawes’ _Handbook_, p. 22; also Griffis’ _Mikado’s Empire_,\r\n      p. 262; and Professor Dixon’s paper on the Christian Valley,\r\n      _Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol. xvi., p. 207.\r\n\r\n  225 See Chamberlain’s _Things Japanese_, 1892, p. 300.\r\n\r\n  226 See _Legacy of Ieyasu_, cap. xv.\r\n\r\n  227 The _Confucian_ classics consist of the Four Books, viz.: _The Great\r\n      Learning_, _The Doctrine of the Mean_, _The Confucian Analects_, and\r\n      _The Sayings of Mencius_; and the Five Canons, viz.: _The Book of\r\n      Changes_, _The Book of Poetry_, _The Book of History_, _The Canon of\r\n      Rites_, and _Spring and Autumn_ (_Annals of the State of Lu_, by\r\n      Confucius).

[Transcriber’s\r\n      Note: This bell is shown as the Frontispiece to the book.] The\r\n      former was erected about A.D. 1252 after plans initiated by Yoritomo\r\n      before his death. The statue in its sitting posture is nearly fifty\r\n      feet in height. It is constructed of separate plates of bronze\r\n      brazed together. Formerly it was enclosed in a temple, but this was\r\n      twice destroyed by tidal waves, and since its last destruction in\r\n      1494 it has not been rebuilt.\r\n\r\n      The bell given in the illustration is that at the temple of\r\n      Daibutsu, the inscription on which is said to have offended Ieyasu.\r\n      It is nearly fourteen feet in height and nine feet in diameter. Its\r\n      weight is more than sixty-three tons.—See Satow and Hawes’\r\n      _Handbook_, p. 368.\r\n\r\n  244 In the account given by Don Rodrigo de Vivero, the late governor of\r\n      Manila, of a visit made in 1608 by him in behalf of Spanish trade,\r\n      Yedo is described as a city of seven hundred thousand inhabitants,\r\n      and Sumpu, which he calls Suruga, where the emperor (as he\r\n      denominates Ieyasu) lived, is estimated to contain from five to six\r\n      hundred thousand inhabitants. He was so pleased with the country\r\n      through which he travelled that he declares, “if he could have\r\n      prevailed upon himself to renounce his God and his king he should\r\n      have preferred that country to his own.”—See Hildreth’s _Japan_,\r\n      etc., pp. 145, 147.\r\n\r\n  245 These letters were written from Japan between 1611 and 1617. They\r\n      were printed in part in Purchas’ _Pilgrimes_, and are included in\r\n      the publications of the Hackluyt Society. From the latter source\r\n      they were printed in pamphlet form by the _Japan Gazette_ at\r\n      Yokohama, 1879. It is from this last source these references are\r\n      taken.\r\n\r\n  246 First letter of Adams in pamphlet edition. Yokohama, 1878, p. 8.\r\n\r\n  247 This name, Nova Spania or New Spain, was first given to the\r\n      peninsula of Yucatan, and was afterward extended to the territory of\r\n      Mexico conquered by Cortez. Finally it was given to all the Spanish\r\n      provinces extending on the Pacific coast from Panama to Van Couver’s\r\n      island. Acapulco was the principal harbor on the Pacific coast.—See\r\n      Prescott’s _Conquest of Mexico_.\r\n\r\n  248 Captain Cocks in his “Diary,” contained in Purchas’ _Pilgrimes_,\r\n      part 1, book iv., gives an account of a visit he made to Yedo in\r\n      1616, on the business of the English trade, at which time he visited\r\n      Adams’ seat, which he calls “Phebe,” doubtless mistaking the sound\r\n      of the real name “Meni.”—See Chamberlain’s _Things Japanese_, 1892,\r\n      p. 15.\r\n\r\n  249 His place of burial was identified in 1872 by Mr. James Walter of\r\n      Yokohama on a beautiful hill near Yokosuka, where both he and his\r\n      Japanese wife lie buried. His will, which was deposited in the\r\n      archives of the East India Company in London, divided his estate\r\n      equally between his Japanese and English families. His Japanese\r\n      landed estate was probably inherited by his Japanese son.

F. Lowder and\r\n      published in Yokohama in 1874. We are indebted to W. E. Grigsby,\r\n      Esq., formerly professor of law in the University of Tōkyō, for a\r\n      valuable paper on the _Legacy of Ieyasu_ in which a careful analysis\r\n      is given and a comparison of its details is made with the provisions\r\n      for the regulation of early communities elsewhere.—See _Asiatic\r\n      Society Transactions_, vol. iii., part 2, p. 131.\r\n\r\n  257 Ieyasu may have had in mind a shocking example of _junshi_ (dying\r\n      with the master) which occurred in his own family. Tadayoshi, his\r\n      fifth son, to whom had been assigned an estate in Owari, died young,\r\n      and five of his retainers, in order to follow their master,\r\n      committed _hara-kiri_ in accordance with the old feudal custom. This\r\n      is believed to have been almost the last instance of the kind, and\r\n      must have touched Ieyasu very closely.—_Mikado’s Empire_, by W. E.\r\n      Griffis, D.D., p. 272.\r\n\r\n  258 Notwithstanding this positive prohibition left by Ieyasu,\r\n      occasionally the strength of the old feudal habit was too great for\r\n      the more merciful spirit. It is said when the third shōgun of the\r\n      Tokugawa family (Iemitsu) died, two of the daimyōs, Hotta of Sakura\r\n      and Abe of Bingo, committed _hara-kiri_. Hotta’s sword, still\r\n      stained with blood, is retained in the _kura_ of the daimiate at\r\n      _Tōkyō_, and on the anniversary of the event is shown to the\r\n      _samurai_, who appear on the occasion in full dress.\r\n\r\n  259 See _Asiatic Society Transactions_, vol. xx., Supplement, in which\r\n      Prof. J.

I have seen in\r\n      the possession of his descendant, the present occupant of the\r\n      beautiful family _yashiki_ in Tōkyō, the original of the memorandum\r\n      showing the arrangement of the rooms through which Mr. Harris was to\r\n      pass, and the position where he was to stand during the delivery of\r\n      his congratulatory remarks.\r\n\r\n  277 In a despatch to the Secretary of State, dated November 25, 1856,\r\n      Mr. Harris explains the condition of the negotiations in reference\r\n      to a commercial treaty. He narrates his interview at Hongkong with\r\n      Sir John Bowring, who told him that he was empowered to negotiate a\r\n      commercial treaty. Mr. Harris shrewdly observes: “I shall call their\r\n      (the Japanese government’s) attention to the fact that by making a\r\n      treaty with me they would save the point of honor that must arise\r\n      from their apparently yielding to the force that backs the\r\n      plenipotentiary and not to the justice of their demands.”\r\n\r\n  278 Although Kanagawa was made an open port for trade by these treaties,\r\n      the adjoining village of Yokohama was found practically better\r\n      suited for the purpose. The very proximity of Kanagawa to the\r\n      _Tōkaidō_, which led foreigners to prefer it when the treaties were\r\n      made, proved to be an objection in the disordered times that\r\n      followed. On this account Yokohama rapidly rose to the importance\r\n      which it still holds.\r\n\r\n  279 The word means Curtain Government, in reference to the curtain with\r\n      which the camp of a general was surrounded. The term is equivalent\r\n      to Military Government, and is used to designate the shōgun’s as\r\n      distinguished from the emperor’s court.\r\n\r\n  280 See _The Life of Ii Naosuke_, by Shimada Saburo, Tōkyō, 1888; also\r\n      the _Constitutional Development of Japan_, by Toyokichi Iyenaga,\r\n      Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University, 1891, p. 15.\r\n\r\n  281 Mr. Heusken who had gone to Japan with Mr. Townsend Harris in 1858\r\n      was a Hollander by birth. The Dutch language at that time was almost\r\n      the only medium through which communication could be had with the\r\n      Japanese. A native interpreter turned the sentiment into Dutch, and\r\n      then a person who understood both Dutch and English translated it\r\n      into the latter tongue. This circuitous system of interpretation\r\n      was, however, soon remedied by native scholars learning English, and\r\n      by English and American scholars learning Japanese.\r\n\r\n  282 See _American Diplomatic Correspondence_, November 27, 1861.\r\n\r\n  283 A full account of this affair may be found in Alcock’s _Capital of\r\n      the Tycoon_, and in the _Life of Laurence Oliphant_.\r\n\r\n  284 A translation of this paper cited from the correspondence presented\r\n      to Parliament is given in Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. i., p.\r\n      138.\r\n\r\n  285 See Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. i., p. 139.\r\n\r\n  286 In Mr. Satow’s translation of _Kinsé Shiriaku_ (p. 18) it is said\r\n      that the _bakufu_ ordered the house of Mito to arrest the men who\r\n      had broken into the English temple residence, but they made their\r\n      escape into Ōshiu and Dewa.\r\n\r\n  287 See the account of the negotiations of this embassy with Earl\r\n      Russell in Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. i., p. 177 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  288 One of the officials naïvely told the American minister when\r\n      speaking of the reception of the embassy in the United States: “We\r\n      did not believe you when you told us of the friendly feeling of your\r\n      country for us; but we now see that all you said was true.”\r\n\r\n  289 The daimyō was really his own son who had been adopted by his\r\n      brother, the former daimyō, and who on the death of his brother had\r\n      succeeded him as daimyō. Shimazu Saburō was therefore legally the\r\n      uncle of his own son.\r\n\r\n  290 Dr. J. C. Hepburn, a resident in Kanagawa at this time, attended to\r\n      the wounded men at the U. S. Consulate. In a letter to me after\r\n      reading the above account, he says that, “it was the common report\r\n      at the time that Richardson did ride into Satsuma’s train and that\r\n      he (Satsuma) said, ‘Kill him.’ It was the general belief that\r\n      Richardson brought the whole catastrophe on himself.”\r\n\r\n  291 In addition to Terashima there were in the company Mori Arinori,\r\n      Yoshida Kiyonari, Hatakeyama Yoshinari, and others. They became\r\n      deeply imbued with the spirit of western institutions and with the\r\n      principles of constitutional liberty and toleration. Their influence\r\n      upon the new career of their country was marked and salutary.\r\n      Through the agency of Mr. Laurence Oliphant a part of them became\r\n      misled with the delusions of Thomas Lake Harris, and with him\r\n      removed to Brocton on the shores of Lake Erie, U. S. where they\r\n      resided for a time as members of the Brotherhood of the New Life.\r\n      They had as associates in this singular community Lady Oliphant and\r\n      her distinguished son, and like them were called upon to perform the\r\n      ordinary menial employments connected with the community.\r\n\r\n  292 It should be stated here that a despatch to the British envoy from\r\n      Earl Russell arrived just after the sailing of the expedition in\r\n      which he says: “That Her Majesty’s government positively enjoin you\r\n      not to undertake any military operation whatever in the interior of\r\n      Japan; and they would indeed regret the adoption of any measures of\r\n      hostility against the Japanese government or princes, even though\r\n      limited to naval operations, unless absolutely required by\r\n      self-defence.” Had this order arrived in time, it is probable that\r\n      the expedition would not have sailed.—_Correspondence Respecting\r\n      Affairs in Japan_, 1875, No. 1, p. 45.\r\n\r\n  293 It will be remembered that the United States at this time had\r\n      occasion to use all her ships-of-war at home in the civil war that\r\n      was raging.\r\n\r\n  294 See _Treaties and Conventions between the Empire of Japan and Other\r\n      Powers_, p. 318.\r\n\r\n  295 The only additional circumstance that deserves mention in this\r\n      connection is that in response to a widely expressed public\r\n      sentiment the Congress of the United States in 1883 refunded to\r\n      Japan $785,000.87, her share in this indemnity.—See _Treaties and\r\n      Conventions between the Empire of Japan and Other Powers_, p. 320.\r\n\r\n  296 See translation of _Kinsé Shiriaku_, Yokohama, 1876, p. 59.\r\n\r\n  297 See translation of _Kinsé Shiriaku_, Yokohama, p. 50.\r\n\r\n  298 See translation of _Kinsé Shiraku_, Yokohama, p. 24.\r\n\r\n  299 See citation in Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. i., p. 260.\r\n\r\n  300 Toyokichi Iyenaga, Ph.D., in his pamphlet on the _Constitutional\r\n      Development of Japan_, p. 17, traces the evolution of the present\r\n      parliamentary institutions to the conferences which were held at\r\n      this and subsequent times.\r\n\r\n  301 Among these was Sanjō Saneyoshi, who afterwards for many years was\r\n      the prime minister of the restored government.\r\n\r\n  302 See Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. i., p. 431.\r\n\r\n  303 The annalist from whom Adams quotes gives the number of houses\r\n      burned as 27,000.

He was originally an ardent anti-foreign partisan, and\r\n      through this sentiment became an advocate of a restoration of the\r\n      emperor. His services in this revolutionary movement were rewarded\r\n      by a pension granted and accepted by the emperor’s express\r\n      command.—See Mounsey’s _Satsuma Rebellion_, London, p. 22.\r\n\r\n  306 In this reconciliation of the Satsuma and Chōshū clans the court\r\n      noble, Iwakura Tomomi, took a prominent part, and after the\r\n      restoration was complete he became one of the principal officers in\r\n      the new government, holding the office of _Udaijin_ until his death.\r\n      He is best known to foreigners as the head of an embassy which\r\n      visited western countries in 1872-3.\r\n\r\n  307 See this memorial as given in Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. ii.,\r\n      p. 24.\r\n\r\n  308 See Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. ii., p. 24.\r\n\r\n  309 See Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. ii., p. 37.\r\n\r\n  310 Translation of _Kinsé Shiriaku_, Yokohama, p. 30.\r\n\r\n  311 Translation of _Kinsé Shiraku_, Yokohama, p. 80.\r\n\r\n  312 See translation of _Kinsé Shiriaku_, Yokohama, p. 82.\r\n\r\n  313 See translation of _Kinsé Shiriaku_, Yokohama, p. 82.\r\n\r\n  314 With that talent for nicknaming which the Japanese exhibit, the\r\n      leading party in the new government was called _Sat-chō-to_; derived\r\n      from the first syllables of the clans, Satsuma, Chōshū, and Tosa.\r\n\r\n  315 See Adams’ _History of Japan_, vol. ii., p. 84.\r\n\r\n  316 The numbers here given, of 10,000 troops in the rebel army and 1,500\r\n      in the imperial army, are much less than those claimed by the\r\n      Japanese authorities, but Mr. Satow who had means of ascertaining\r\n      the truth gives the numbers as stated in the text. See Adams’\r\n      _History of Japan_, vol. ii., p. 99, note.\r\n\r\n  317 An incident connected with this return illustrates both the times\r\n      and customs of the country. Hori Kura-no-kami, a prominent retainer\r\n      of the ex-shōgun, besought his master to commit _hara-kiri_ as the\r\n      only way in which his own honor and the dignity of the Tokugawa clan\r\n      could be preserved. He offered to join him in this tragic ceremony,\r\n      but the ex-shōgun declined to end his life in this way. Thereupon\r\n      the devoted retainer retired and in the presence of his own friends\r\n      himself committed _hara-kiri_.\r\n\r\n_  318 American Diplomatic Correspondence_, April 3, 1868.\r\n\r\n  319 An English translation of this memorial will be found in Black’s\r\n      _New Japan_, vol. ii., p. 84.

An official\r\n      translation was published at Yokohama in 1889.\r\n\r\n  341 In the official list Jingō is not reckoned, and the time of her\r\n      reign is counted with that of her son and successor.\r\n\r\n  342 From _Japanese Chronological Tables_, by William Bramsen, 1880.\r\n\r\n      The system of counting from year-periods (_nengō_) was introduced\r\n      from China. These periods of Japanese history do not correspond to\r\n      the reigns of the emperors. A new one was chosen whenever it was\r\n      deemed necessary to commemorate an auspicious or ward off a malign\r\n      event. By a notification issued in 1872 it was announced that\r\n      hereafter the year-period should be changed but once during the\r\n      reign of an emperor. The current period, _Meiji_ (Enlightened\r\n      Peace), will therefore continue during the reign of the present\r\n      emperor.\r\n\r\n      The numbers in the second column of this table indicate the years as\r\n      counted from the founding of the empire by Jimmu Tennō. According to\r\n      the official chronology this occurred B.C. 660.\r\n\r\n  343 Translated from the chronology of the shōguns in _Mittheilungen der\r\n      deutschen Gesellschaft fur Natur und Volkerkunde Ostasiens_, Heft 3,\r\n      1873.\r\n\r\n  344 The translation of these laws of Shōtoku Taishi was furnished by Mr.\r\n      Tsuji Shinji, late vice-minister of state for education, and by Mr.\r\n      Matsumoto Kumpei.",
