Cook, to be our companion through the magnificent rooms of our own\r\nNational Gallery; without question now the most important collection of\r\npaintings in Europe for the purposes of the general student. Of course\r\nthe Florentine School must always be studied in Florence, the Dutch\r\nin Holland, and the Roman in Rome; but to obtain a clear knowledge of\r\ntheir relations to each other, and compare with the best advantage the\r\ncharacters in which they severally excel, the thoughtful scholars of\r\nany foreign country ought now to become pilgrims to the Dome--(such as\r\nit is)--of Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\nWe have indeed--be it to our humiliation remembered--small reason\r\nto congratulate ourselves on the enlargement of the collection now\r\nbelonging to the public, by the sale of the former possessions of our\r\nnobles. But since the parks and castles which were once the pride,\r\nbeauty, and political strength of England are doomed by the progress\r\nof democracy to be cut up into lots on building leases, and have\r\ntheir libraries and pictures sold at Sotheby's and Christie's, we\r\nmay at least be thankful that the funds placed by the Government at\r\nthe disposal of the Trustees for the National Gallery have permitted\r\nthem to save so much from the wreck of English mansions and Italian\r\nmonasteries, and enrich the recreations of our metropolis with graceful\r\ninterludes by Perugino and Raphael.\r\n\r\nIt will be at once felt by the readers of the following catalogue that\r\nit tells them, about every picture and its painter, just the things\r\nthey wished to know. They may rest satisfied also that it tells them\r\nthese things on the best historical authorities, and that they have in\r\nits concise pages an account of the rise and decline of the arts of the\r\nOld Masters, and record of their personal characters and worldly state\r\nand fortunes, leaving nothing of authentic tradition, and essential\r\ninterest, untold.\r\n\r\nAs a collection of critical remarks by esteemed judges, and of clearly\r\nformed opinions by earnest lovers of art, the little book possesses a\r\nmetaphysical interest quite as great as its historical one. Of course\r\nthe first persons to be consulted on the merit of a picture are those\r\nfor whom the artist painted it: with those in after generations who\r\nhave sympathy with them; one does not ask a Roundhead or a Republican\r\nhis opinion of the Vandyke at Wilton, nor a Presbyterian minister his\r\nimpressions of the Sistine Chapel:--but from any one honestly taking\r\npleasure in any sort of painting, it is always worth while to hear the\r\ngrounds of his admiration, if he can himself analyse them. For those\r\nwho take no pleasure in painting, or who are offended by its inevitable\r\nfaults, any form of criticism is insolent. Opinion is only valuable\r\nwhen it\r\n\r\n                  gilds with various rays\r\n    These painted clouds that beautify our days.\r\n\r\nWhen I last lingered in the Gallery before my old favourites, I\r\nthought them more wonderful than ever before; but as I draw towards\r\nthe close of life, I feel that the real world is more wonderful yet:\r\nthat Painting has not yet fulfilled half her mission,--she has told us\r\nonly of the heroism of men and the happiness of angels: she may perhaps\r\nrecord in future the beauty of a world whose mortal inhabitants are\r\nhappy, and which angels may be glad to visit.\r\n\r\n  J. RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  _April_ 1888.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nWITH SOME\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY\r\n\r\n\r\n=Division into Volumes.=--In arrangement and, to some degree, in\r\ncontents the Handbook in its present form differs from the earlier\r\neditions. Important changes have been made during the last few years\r\nin the constitution and scope of the National Gallery itself. The\r\nGallery now consists of two branches controlled by a single Board of\r\nTrustees: (1) the \"National Gallery\" in Trafalgar Square; and (2) the\r\n\"Tate Gallery\" or, as it is officially called, the \"National Gallery\r\nof British Art\" on the Thames Embankment at Millbank.[1] At the former\r\nGallery are hung all the pictures belonging to Foreign Schools.\r\nPictures of the British Schools are hung partly in Trafalgar Square\r\nand partly at Millbank, and from time to time pictures are moved from\r\none Gallery to the other. It has therefore been decided to divide the\r\nHandbook into volumes according to subject rather than according to\r\nposition. Volume I. deals with the Foreign Schools (National Gallery);\r\nVolume II., with the British Schools (National Gallery and Tate\r\nGallery). By this division the convenience of the books for purposes\r\nof reference or use in the Galleries will not be disturbed by future\r\nchanges in the allocation of British pictures between Trafalgar Square\r\nand Millbank respectively.\r\n\r\n=How to use the Handbook.=--The one fixed point in the arrangement of\r\nthe National Gallery is the numbering of the pictures. The numbers\r\naffixed to the frames, and referred to in the Official Reports\r\nand Catalogues, are never changed. This is an excellent rule, the\r\nobservance of which, in the case of some foreign galleries, would have\r\nsaved no little inconvenience to students and visitors. In the present,\r\nas in the preceding editions of the Handbook, advantage has been taken\r\nof this fixed system of numbering; and in the pages devoted to the\r\nBiographical and Descriptive Catalogue the pictures are enumerated in\r\ntheir numerical order. The introductory remarks on the chief Schools\r\nof Painting represented in the Gallery are brought together at the\r\nbeginning of the book. The visitor who desires to make an historical\r\nstudy of the Collection may, if he will, glance first at the general\r\nintroduction given to the pictures in each School; and then, as he\r\nmakes his survey of the rooms devoted to the several Schools, note the\r\nnumbers on the frames, and refer to the Numerical Catalogue following\r\nthe series of introductions. On the other hand, the visitor who\r\ndoes not care to use the Handbook in this way has only to skip the\r\npreliminary chapters, and to pass at once, as he finds himself before\r\nthis picture or that, to the Numerical Catalogue. For the convenience,\r\nagain, of visitors or students desiring to find the works of some\r\nparticular painter, the full and detailed Index of Painters, first\r\nintroduced in the Third Edition, has here been retained. References to\r\nall the pictures by each painter, and to the page where some account\r\nof his life and work is given, will be found in this Index. Finally,\r\na concise Numerical Index is given, wherein the reader may find at\r\nonce the particulars of acquisition, the _provenance_, and other\r\ncircumstances regarding every picture (by a foreign artist) in the\r\npossession of the National Gallery, wherever deposited.\r\n\r\n=History of the National Gallery.=--\"For the purposes of the general\r\nstudent, the National Gallery is now,\" said Mr. Ruskin in 1888,\r\n\"without question the most important collection of paintings in\r\nEurope.\" Forty years before he said of the same Gallery that it was\r\n\"an European jest.\" The growth of the Gallery from jest to glory[2]\r\nmay be traced in the final index to this book, where the pictures\r\nare enumerated in the order of their acquisition. Many incidents\r\nconnected with the acquisition of particular pictures will also be\r\nfound chronicled in the Catalogue[3]; but it may here be interesting\r\nto summarise the history of the institution. The National Gallery of\r\nEngland dates from the year 1824, when the Angerstein Collection of\r\nthirty-eight pictures was purchased. They were exhibited for some\r\nyears in Mr. Angerstein's house in Pall Mall; for it was not till\r\n1832 that the building in which the collection is now deposited was\r\nbegun. This building, which was designed expressly for the purpose by\r\nWilliam Wilkins, R.A., was opened to the public in 1838.[4] At that\r\ntime, however, the Gallery comprised only six rooms, the remaining\r\nspace in the building being devoted to the Royal Academy of Arts--whose\r\ninscription may still be seen above a disused doorway to the right of\r\nthe main entrance. In 1860 the first enlargement was made--consisting\r\nof one new room. In 1869 the Royal Academy removed to Burlington House,\r\nand five more rooms were gained for the National Gallery. In 1876 the\r\nso-called \"New Wing\" was added, erected from a design by E. M. Barry,\r\nR.A. In that year the whole collection was for the first time housed\r\nunder a single roof. The English School had, since its increase in\r\n1847 by the Vernon gift, been exhibited first at Marlborough House\r\n(up to 1859), and afterwards at South Kensington. In 1884 a further\r\naddition of five rooms was commenced under the superintendence of Sir\r\nJohn Taylor, of Her Majesty's Office of Works; these rooms (numbered\r\nI., II., III., V., VI. on the plan), with a new staircase and other\r\nimprovements, were opened to the public in 1887; and the Gallery then\r\nconsisted of twenty-two rooms, besides ample accommodation for the\r\noffices of the Director and the convenience of the students.[5] A\r\nfurther extension of the Gallery, on the site of St. George's Barracks,\r\nwas completed in 1911; this consisted of six new rooms.[6] At the same\r\ntime the older portions of the building were reconstructed, in order to\r\nmake it fire-proof. The rearrangement of the Gallery is described below\r\n(p. xxv).\r\n\r\n=Growth of the Collection.=--This growth in the Galleries has, however,\r\nbarely sufficed to keep pace with the growth of the pictures. In 1838\r\nthe total number of national pictures was still only 150. In 1875 the\r\nnumber was 926. In 1911 the number of pictures, etc. (exclusive of\r\nthe Turner water-colours) vested in the Trustees of the Gallery was\r\nnearly 2870. This result has been due to the combination of private\r\ngenerosity and State aid which is characteristic of our country. The\r\nVernon gift of English pictures in 1847 added over 150 at a stroke.\r\nTen years later Turner's bequest added (besides some 19,000 drawings\r\nin various stages of completion) 100 pictures. In 1876 the Wynn Ellis\r\ngift of foreign pictures added nearly another hundred. In 1910 the\r\nbequest of Mr. George Salting added 192 pictures (160 foreign and 32\r\nBritish). Particulars of other gifts and bequests may be gathered from\r\nthe Appendix. Parliamentary grants have of late years been supplemented\r\nby private subscriptions and bequests. In 1890 Messrs. N. M. Rothschild\r\nand Sons, Sir Edward Guinness, Bart. (now Lord Iveagh), and Mr. Charles\r\nCotes, each contributed £10,000 towards the purchase of three important\r\npictures (1314-5-6); whilst in 1904, Mr. Astor, Mr. Beit, Lord Burton,\r\nLord Iveagh, Mr. Pierpont Morgan, and Lady Wantage subscribed £21,000\r\nto supplement a Government grant for the purchase of Titian's \"Portrait\r\nof Ariosto\" (1944). In 1903 a \"National Art-Collections Fund\" was\r\nestablished for organising private benefactions to the Galleries\r\nand Museums of the United Kingdom; it was through this agency that\r\nthe famous \"Venus\" by Velazquez (2057), in 1906, and the still more\r\nfamous \"Christina, Duchess of Milan,\" by Holbein (2475), in 1909, were\r\nadded to the National Gallery. The same Fund contributed also to the\r\npurchase in 1911, of the Castle Howard Mabuse (2790). Mr. Francis\r\nClarke bequeathed £23,104, and Mr. T. D. Lewis £10,000, the interest\r\nupon which sums was to be expended in pictures. Mr. R. C. Wheeler\r\nleft a sum of £2655, the interest on which was to purchase _English_\r\npictures. Mr. J. L. Walker left £10,000, not to form a fund, but to\r\nbe spent on \"a picture or pictures.\" In 1903 a large bequest was made\r\nto the Gallery by Colonel Temple West. The will was disputed; but\r\nby the settlement ultimately effected (1907, 1908) a sum of £99,909\r\nwas received, of which the interest is available for the purchase of\r\npictures. In 1906 Mr. C. E. G. Mackerell made a bequest, and this\r\nwill also was disputed. By the settlement (1908) a sum of £2859 was\r\nreceived, and a further sum will be forthcoming at the expiration\r\nof certain life-interests, of which sums, again, the interest will\r\nbe available for the purchase of pictures. Appendix II. shows the\r\npictures acquired from these several funds. This growth of the Gallery\r\nby private gift and public expenditure concurrently accords with the\r\nmanner of its birth. One of the factors which decided Lord Liverpool in\r\nfavour of the purchase of Mr. Angerstein's Collection was the generous\r\noffer of a private citizen--Sir George Beaumont.\r\n\r\n=Value of the Pictures.=--Sir George's gift, as we shall see from a\r\nlittle story attaching to one of his pictures (61), was not of that\r\nwhich cost him nothing in the giving. The generosity of private donors,\r\nwhich that little story places in so pleasing and even pathetic a\r\nlight, has been accompanied by public expenditure at once liberal\r\nand prudent. The total cost of the collection so far has been about\r\n£900,000[7]; at present prices there is little doubt that the pictures\r\nso acquired could be sold for several times that sum. It will be seen\r\nin the following pages that there have been some bad bargains; but\r\nthese mostly belong to the period when responsibility was divided, in\r\nan undefined way, between the Trustees and the Keeper. The present\r\norganisation of the Gallery dates from 1855, when, as the result\r\nof several Commissions and Committees, a Treasury Minute was drawn\r\nup--appointing a Director to preside over the Gallery, and placing an\r\nannual grant of money at his disposal.[8] The curious reader may trace\r\nthe use of this discretion made by successive Directors in the table of\r\nprices given in the final index--a table which would afford material\r\nfor an instructive history of recent fashions in art. The annual grant\r\nhas from time to time been supplemented by special grants, of which\r\nthe most notable were those for the Peel Collection, the Blenheim\r\npictures, the Longford Castle pictures, two new Rembrandts (1674-5),\r\nTitian's \"Ariosto\" (1944), Holbein's \"Duchess of Milan\" (2475),\r\nand Mabuse's \"Adoration of the Magi\" (2790) respectively. The Peel\r\nCollection consisted of seventy-seven pictures. The vote was proposed\r\nin the House of Commons on March 20, 1871, and in supporting it the\r\nlate Sir W. H. Gregory (one of the Trustees of the Gallery) alluded to\r\n\"the additional interest connected with the collection, for it was the\r\nlabour of love of one of our greatest English Statesmen, and it was\r\ngratifying to see that the taste of the amateur was on a par with the\r\nsagacity of the minister, for throughout this large collection there\r\ncould hardly be named more than two or three pictures which were not of\r\nthe very highest order of merit.\" The price paid for this collection,\r\n£70,000, was exceedingly moderate.[9] The \"princely\" price given for\r\nthe two Blenheim pictures is more open to exception; but if the price\r\nwas unprecedented, so also was the sale of so superb a Raphael in the\r\npresent day unprecedented.\r\n\r\n=Features of the Collection.=--The result of the expenditure with\r\nwhich successive Parliaments have thus supplemented private gifts\r\nhas been to raise the National Gallery to a position second to that\r\nof no single collection in the world. The number of pictures now on\r\nview in Trafalgar Square, exclusive of the water-colours, is about\r\n1600.[10] This number is very much smaller than that of the galleries\r\nat Dresden, Madrid, and Paris--the three largest in the world. On\r\nthe other hand no foreign gallery has been so carefully acquired, or\r\nso wisely weeded, as ours. An Act was passed in 1856 authorising the\r\nsale of unsuitable works, whilst another passed in 1883 sanctioned the\r\nthinning of the Gallery in favour of Provincial collections. There\r\nare still many serious gaps. In the Italian School we have no work by\r\nMasaccio--the first of the naturalisers in landscape; only one doubtful\r\nexample of Palma Vecchio, the greatest of the Bergamese painters;\r\nno first-rate portrait by Tintoret. The French School is little\r\nrepresented--an omission which is, however, splendidly supplied in the\r\nWallace Collection at Hertford House, now the property of the nation.\r\nIn the National Gallery itself there is no picture by \"the incomparable\r\nWatteau,\" the \"prince of Court painters.\" The specimens of the Spanish\r\nSchool are few in number, though Velazquez is now finely represented;\r\nwhilst amongst the old masters of our own British School there are\r\nmany gaps for some future Vernon or Tate to fill up. But on the other\r\nhand we can set against these deficiencies many painters who, and even\r\nschools which, can nowhere--in one place--be so well studied as in\r\nTrafalgar Square. The works of Crivelli--one of the quaintest and most\r\ncharming of the earlier Venetians--which hang together in one room; the\r\nworks of the Brescian School, including those of its splendid portrait\r\npainters--Moroni and Il Moretto; the series of Raphaels, showing each\r\nof his successive styles; and in the English School the unrivalled and\r\nincomparable collection of Turners,--are amongst the particular glories\r\nof the National Collection. Historically the collection is remarkably\r\ninstructive. This is a point which successive Directors have, on the\r\nrecommendation of Royal Commissions, kept steadily in view; and which\r\nhas been very clearly shown since the successive re-arrangements of the\r\nGallery after the extension in 1887.\r\n\r\n=Scope of the Handbook.=--It is in order to help visitors to take full\r\nadvantage of the opportunities thus afforded for historical study that\r\nI have furnished some general introductions to the various Schools\r\nof Painting represented in the National Gallery. With regard to the\r\nnotes in the Numerical Catalogue, my object has been to interest the\r\ndaily increasing numbers of the general public who visit the National\r\nGallery. The full inventories and other details, which are necessary\r\nfor the identification of pictures, and which are most admirably given\r\nin the (unabridged) Official Catalogue--would obviously be out of place\r\nin a book designed for popular use. Nor, secondly, would any elaborate\r\ntechnical criticism have been in keeping--even had it been in my power\r\nto offer it--with a guide intended for unprofessional readers. C. R.\r\nLeslie, the father of the present Academician, tells how he \"spoke one\r\nday to Stothard of his touching picture of a sailor taking leave of his\r\nwife or sweetheart. 'I am glad you like it, sir,' said Stothard; 'it\r\nwas painted with japanner's gold size.'\" I have been mainly concerned\r\nwith the sentiment of the pictures, and have for the most part left the\r\n\"japanner's gold size\" alone.\r\n\r\n=Mr. Ruskin's Notes.=--It had often occurred to me, as a student of\r\nMr. Ruskin's writings, that a collection of his scattered notes upon\r\npainters and pictures now in the National Gallery would be of great\r\nvalue. I applied to Mr. Ruskin in the matter, and he readily permitted\r\nme to make what use I liked of any, or all, of his writings. The\r\ngenerosity of this permission, which was supplemented by constant\r\nencouragement and counsel, makes me the more anxious to explain clearly\r\nthe limits of his responsibility for the book. He did not attempt to\r\nrevise, or correct, either my gleanings from his own books, or the\r\nnotes added by myself from other sources. Beyond his general permission\r\nto me to reprint his past writings, Mr. Ruskin had, therefore,\r\nno responsibility for this compilation whatever. I should more\r\nparticularly state that the pages upon the Turner Gallery in the Second\r\nVolume were not even glanced at by him. The criticisms from his books\r\nthere collected represent, therefore, solely his attitude to Turner at\r\nthe time they were severally written. But, subject to this deduction,\r\nthe passages from Ruskin arranged throughout the following pages\r\nwill, I hope, enable the _Handbook_ to serve a second purpose. Any\r\nstudent who goes through the Gallery under Ruskin's guidance--even at\r\nsecond-hand--can hardly fail to obtain some insight into the system of\r\nart-teaching embodied in his works. The full exposition of that system\r\nmust still be studied in the original text-books, but here the reader\r\nmay find a series of examples and illustrations which will perhaps make\r\nthe study more vivid and actual.\r\n\r\n=Attribution of Pictures.=--In the matter of _attributions_, the rule,\r\nin the successive editions of this Handbook, has been to follow the\r\nauthority of the Official Labels and Catalogues. Criticism has been\r\nvery busy of late years with the traditional attribution of pictures\r\nin our Gallery, and successive Directors introduce their several, and\r\nsometimes contradictory, opinions on such points. Thus more than One\r\nOld Master hitherto supposed to be represented in the Gallery has\r\nbeen banished, and others, whose fame had not previously been bruited\r\nabroad, have been credited with familiar masterpieces. Thus--to\r\nnotice some of the changes made by Sir Edward Poynter (Catalogue of\r\n1906)--among the Venetians, Bastiani and Catena have come into favour.\r\nTo Bastiani was given the picture of \"The Doge Giovanni Mocenigo\" (750)\r\nwhich for forty years has been exhibited as a work by Carpaccio; that\r\ncharming painter now disappears from the National Gallery. To Catena\r\nis attributed the \"St. Jerome\" (694), which for several decades had\r\nbeen cited as peculiarly characteristic of Bellini. To Catena also is\r\ngiven the \"Warrior in Adoration\" (234). In this case Catena's gain is\r\nGiorgione's loss. But elsewhere Giorgione has received compensation for\r\ndisturbance. To him has been given the \"Adoration of the Magi\" (1160),\r\nwhich some critics attributed to Catena. The beautiful \"Ecce Homo\"\r\n(1310), which was sold as a Carlo Dolci and bought by Sir Frederick\r\nBurton as a Bellini, was ascribed by Sir Edward Poynter to Cima. One\r\nof the minor Venetians--Basaiti, who enjoyed a high reputation at the\r\nNational Gallery--was deprived of the pretty \"Madonna of the Meadow\"\r\n(599), which went to swell the opulent record of Bellini. Among the\r\nFlorentines, a newcomer is Zenobio Macchiavelli, to whom is attributed\r\nan altar-piece (586) formerly catalogued under the name of Fra Filippo\r\nLippi. Cosimo Rosselli, hitherto credited with a large \"St. Jerome in\r\nthe Desert\" (227), now disappears; it was labelled \"Tuscan School,\"\r\nand was any one's picture. The attribution of pictures belonging to\r\nthe group of the two Lippis and Botticelli is still very uncertain.\r\nA note on these critical diversities will be found under No. 293.\r\nAmong alterations in other schools we may note the substitution of\r\nZurbaran for Velazquez as the painter of \"The Nativity,\" No. 232; the\r\nattribution to Patinir, the Fleming, of a landscape formerly labelled\r\n\"Venetian School\" (1298); and the discovery of Jacob van Oost as the\r\npainter of a charming \"Portrait of a Boy\" (1137), which, but for an\r\nimpossibility in the dates, might well continue to pass as Isaac van\r\nOstade's.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal changes made in the ascriptions of the pictures\r\nduring Sir Edward Poynter's directorate. His successor, Sir Charles\r\nHolroyd, has recently made many others, as shown in the following list:\r\n\r\n      97 (_P. Veronese_), now described as \"after Veronese.\"\r\n\r\n      215, 216 (_School of T. Gaddi_), now assigned to _Lorenzo\r\n      Monaco_ (_see_ 1897).\r\n\r\n      227 (_Florentine School_), now assigned to _Francesco\r\n      Botticini_ (a Tuscan painter of the 15th century).\r\n\r\n      276 (_School of Giotto_), now assigned to _Spinello Aretino_;\r\n      for whom, _see_ 581.\r\n\r\n      296 (_Florentine School_), now assigned to _Verrocchio_; _see_\r\n      below, p. 262.\r\n\r\n      568 (_School of Giotto_), now assigned to _Angelo di Taddeo\r\n      Gaddi_, a pupil of Giotto's chief disciple, Taddeo Gaddi (for\r\n      whom, _see_ p. 211).\r\n\r\n      579 (_School of Taddeo Gaddi_), now assigned to _Niccolo di\r\n      Pietro Gerini_, a painter of Florence who was inscribed in the\r\n      guild in 1368 and died in 1415. Our picture is dated 1387.\r\n\r\n      579A (_School of Taddeo Gaddi_), now assigned to Gaddi's pupil,\r\n      _Giovanni da Milano_.\r\n\r\n      581 (_Spinello Aretino_), now assigned to _Orcagna_; for whom,\r\n      _see_ 569.\r\n\r\n      585 (_Umbrian School_), now assigned to \"School of\r\n      _Pollajuolo_\"; for whom, _see_ 292.\r\n\r\n      591 (_Benozzo Gozzoli_), now described as \"School of Benozzo.\"\r\n\r\n      592 (_Filippino Lippi_), now assigned to _Botticelli_; _see\r\n      below_, p. 294 _n._\r\n\r\n      599 (_Giovanni Bellini_), now re-assigned to _Basaiti_; _see\r\n      below_, p. 299.\r\n\r\n      636 (_Titian_ or _Palma_). After a period of ascription to\r\n      Titian, this portrait is now re-assigned to _Palma_; _see\r\n      below_, p. 315.\r\n\r\n      650 (_Angelo Bronzino_), now assigned to his pupil, _Alessandro\r\n      Allori_ (Florentine: 1535-1607).\r\n\r\n      654 (_School of Roger van der Weyden_), now assigned to _School\r\n      of Robert Campin_; for whom, _see_ 2608.\r\n\r\n      655 (_Bernard van Orley_), now ascribed to _Ambrosius Benson_;\r\n      born in Lombardy, painted in Bruges, living in 1545.\r\n\r\n      658 (_after Schongauer_), now assigned to _School of Campin_.\r\n      The picture ascribed to the \"Master of Flémalle,\" as referred\r\n      to in the text (p. 328), is now No. 2608 (also now assigned to\r\n      Campin).\r\n\r\n      659 (_Johann Rottenhammer_), now assigned to _Jan Brueghel, the\r\n      younger_ (1601-1667), a scholar of Brueghel, the elder.\r\n\r\n      664 (_Roger van der Weyden_), now assigned to _Dierick Bouts_;\r\n      for whom, _see_ 2595.\r\n\r\n      670 (_Angelo Bronzino_), now described as \"School of Bronzino.\"\r\n\r\n      696 (_Flemish School_), now assigned to _Petrus Cristus_; for\r\n      whom, _see_ 2593.\r\n\r\n      704 (_Bronzino_), now described as \"School of Bronzino.\"\r\n\r\n      709 (_Flemish School_), now assigned to _Memlinc_; for whom,\r\n      _see_ 686.\r\n\r\n      713 (_Jan Mostaert_), now assigned to _Jan Prevost_ (Flemish:\r\n      1462-1529), a painter of Bruges and a friend of Albert Dürer.\r\n\r\n      714 (_Cornelis Engelbertsz_), now assigned to _Bernard van\r\n      Orley_; for whom, _see_ 655.\r\n\r\n      715 (_Joachim Patinir_), now assigned to _Quentin Metsys_; for\r\n      whom, _see_ 295.\r\n\r\n      750 (_Lazzaro Bastiani_), now described as \"School of Gentile\r\n      Bellini\"; for whom, _see_ 1213.\r\n\r\n      774 (_Flemish School_), now assigned to _Dierick Bouts_; for\r\n      whom, _see_ 2595.\r\n\r\n      779, 780 (_Borgognone_), now described as \"School of\r\n      Borgognone.\"\r\n\r\n      781 (_Florentine School_), now attributed to _Botticini_.\r\n\r\n      782 (_Botticelli_), now described as \"School of Botticelli.\"\r\n\r\n      808 (_Giovanni Bellini_), now assigned to _Gentile Bellini_;\r\n      _see below_, p. 422 _n._\r\n\r\n      916 (_School of Botticelli_), now assigned to _Jacopo del\r\n      Sellaio_; for whom, _see_ 2492.\r\n\r\n      943 (_Flemish School_), now assigned to _D.

Bouts), who died in 1549.\r\n\r\n      1085 (_School of the Rhine_), now assigned to _Geertgen Tot\r\n      Sint Jans_ (Dutch: 15th century). This painter was a pupil of\r\n      Albert van Ouwater; he established himself at Haarlem in a\r\n      convent belonging to the Knights of St. John (whence his name,\r\n      Gerard of St. John's). His works were seen and admired by Dürer.\r\n\r\n      1086 (_Flemish School_), now assigned to the \"School of Robert\r\n      Campin\"; for whom, _see_ 2608.\r\n\r\n      1109A (_Mengs_). To this picture the number 1099 (noted in\r\n      previous editions of this _Handbook_ as having been missed in\r\n      the official numbering) is now given.\r\n\r\n      1121 (_Venetian School_), now assigned to _Catena_; for whom,\r\n      _see_ 234.\r\n\r\n      1124 (_Filippino Lippi_), now described as \"School of\r\n      Botticelli.\"\r\n\r\n      1126 (_Botticelli_), now assigned to _Botticini_; _see_ on this\r\n      subject p. 536 _n._\r\n\r\n      1160 (_School of Giorgione_), now assigned to _Giorgione_\r\n      himself.\r\n\r\n      1199 (_Florentine School_), now assigned to _Pier Francesco\r\n      Fiorentino_; a Tuscan painter of the 15th century.\r\n\r\n      1376 (_Velazquez_), now \"ascribed to Velazquez.\"\r\n\r\n      1412 (_Filippino Lippi_), now described as \"School of\r\n      Botticelli.\"\r\n\r\n      1419 (_Flemish School_), now assigned to _Early French School_.\r\n      The picture formed part of a diptych; the companion picture was\r\n      in the Dudley Collection (No. 29 in the sale catalogue of 1892,\r\n      where an illustration of it was given). In this the choir of\r\n      St. Denis is shown. There are two portraits by the same hand at\r\n      Chantilly.\r\n\r\n      1433 (_Flemish School_), now assigned to _Roger van der\r\n      Weyden_; for whom, _see_ 664.\r\n\r\n      1434 (_Velazquez_), now \"ascribed to Velazquez,\" and it is\r\n      added that the picture has been attributed to Luca Giordano\r\n      (Neapolitan: 1632-1705).\r\n\r\n      1440 (_Giovanni Bellini_), now assigned to _Gentile Bellini_;\r\n      for whom, _see_ 1213.\r\n\r\n      1468 (_Spinello Aretino_), now assigned to _Jacopo di Cione_,\r\n      the younger brother of Andrea Cione (called Orcagna); he was\r\n      still living in 1394.\r\n\r\n      1652 This picture has hitherto been assigned to the _British\r\n      School_ (and therefore included in vol. ii. of the _Handbook_),\r\n      and called a portrait of Katharine Parr. It is now discovered\r\n      to belong to the _Dutch School_ and to be a \"portrait of Madame\r\n      van der Goes.\"\r\n\r\n      1699 (_Jan Vermeer_), now \"attributed to Vermeer.\"\r\n\r\n      1842 (_Tuscan School_), now \"attributed to _Stefano di\r\n      Giovanni_,\" known as _Sassetta_ (Sienese: 1392-1450).\r\n\r\n      1870 \"Angels with Keys,\" by _Sebastiano Conca_ (Neapolitan:\r\n      1679-1764). Lent by the Victoria and Albert Museum.\r\n\r\n      1903 (_Jan Fyt_), now assigned to _Pieter Boel_ (Flemish:\r\n      1622-1674), of Antwerp, who became official painter to Louis\r\n      XIV.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that critical fashions are unstable, and that in\r\nseveral cases Sir Edward Poynter's changes have been reversed. The\r\nrecent alterations were made just as this edition of the _Handbook_ was\r\ngoing to press. The ascriptions in the body of my Catalogue remain,\r\ntherefore, in conformity with the Official Catalogue of 1906 which\r\nembodied Sir Edward Poynter's views. The lists of painters and pictures\r\nat the end (Appendix I. and II.) have, on the other hand, been revised\r\nin accordance with Sir Charles Holroyd's alterations.\r\n\r\n=Additional Notes.=--In the _notes upon the pictures_, a large number\r\nof additional remarks have been introduced since this _Handbook_\r\nfirst appeared. These, it is hoped, may serve here and there to\r\ndeepen the visitor's impression, to suggest fresh points of view, to\r\nopen up incidental sources of interest. Attention may be called, by\r\nway of example, under this head, to several notes upon the designs\r\ndepicted on the dresses, draperies, and backgrounds of the Italian\r\npictures. These designs, sometimes invented by the artists themselves\r\nand sometimes copied from actual stuffs, form a series of examples\r\nwhich illustrate the \"art fabrics\" of the best period of Italian\r\ndecorative art, and which might well give hints for the decoration of\r\ntextile fabrics to-day.[11] Another incidental source of interest in\r\na collection of pictures such as ours, is the historical development\r\nof art as it may be traced in the several representations of the same\r\nsubject by different painters, in successive periods, and in different\r\nschools. Such comparisons are instructive to those interested alike\r\nin the evolution of art and in the history of religious ideas. In the\r\nart of mediæval Christendom we find an unwritten theology, a popular\r\nfigurative teaching of the sublime story of Christianity blended with\r\nthe traditions of many generations. On the walls of the National\r\nGallery we may see a series of typical scenes from the Annunciation to\r\nthe Passion, from the childhood of Christ to His Death, Resurrection,\r\nand Ascension, together with ideal forms of apostles and saints. These\r\npictures, contemplated in sequence and compared with one another,\r\nafford, as a writer in the _Dublin Review_ (October 1888) has pointed\r\nout, a large and interesting field for thought. Very interesting it\r\nis also to trace the different types which prevail in the different\r\nschools. Thus at Florence, the Madonna is a tender, shrinking, delicate\r\nmaiden. At Venice, she is a calm, serene, and pure-spirited mother.\r\nThe Florentine \"handmaiden of the Lord\" often wears a mystic, and\r\nalmost always an intellectual air. The Venetian type, seen at its\r\ncentral perfection in Bellini, has a neck firm as a column; the child\r\nis nude and plays with a flower or fruit; grandeur of mien and a noble\r\ntype of motherhood are the ideals the Venetian painters set before\r\nthemselves. The Lombard Madonna is less spiritual and severe than the\r\nFlorentine. A refined worldly beauty replaces here the poetic idealism\r\nof the Tuscan artists. With the Umbrian painters the model of the\r\nMadonna is usually a softly-rounded and very girlish maiden. A certain\r\nmystic pensiveness informs her features. Her feet tread this earth,\r\nbut her soul is absorbed in the contemplation of the infinite.[12] A\r\nstudy of the successive characteristics of Raphael's Madonnas, passing\r\nfrom the vaguely divine to the frankly human, would form material\r\nfor a volume in itself.[13] In another department of the painter's\r\nart, the comparative method of study is no less suggestive. It is one\r\nof the most curious points of interest in any large collection of\r\npictures to notice the different impressions that the same elements\r\nof natural scenery make upon different painters. As figure painting\r\ncame to be perfected, some adequate suggestion of landscape background\r\nwas required. Giotto and Orcagna first attempted to give resemblance\r\nto nature in this respect. Subsequent painters carried the attempt\r\nto greater success, but it was long before landscape for its own\r\nsake obtained attention. When it did, the preferences of individual\r\npainters, now freed from conventionalism, found abundant scope, as we\r\nmay see by pausing in succession before the flowery meadows of the\r\n\"primitives,\" the \"fiery woodlands of Titian,\" the savage crags of\r\nSalvator Rosa, the \"saffron skies of Claude.\"[14] These are some of the\r\nincidental points of interest upon which additional notes have been\r\nsupplied in recent editions. Many others will be discovered by the\r\npatient reader of the following pages.\r\n\r\n=Notices of Painters.=--Lastly, the _biographical and critical notices_\r\nof the painters have been revised and expanded since the first\r\nappearance of the book. Many have been re-written throughout, nearly\r\nall have been re-cast, and a good many references to pictures in other\r\ngalleries and countries have been introduced. The important accession\r\nto the National Gallery of the Arundel Society's unique collection\r\nof copies from the old masters affords an opportunity even to the\r\nuntraveled visitor to become acquainted, in some sort, with the most\r\nfamous wall-paintings of Italy. Mr. Ruskin, by whose death the National\r\nGallery lost one of its best and oldest friends, once expressed a hope\r\nto me that the notices of the painters given in this Handbook would\r\nbe found useful by some readers not only as a companion in Trafalgar\r\nSquare, but also for other galleries, at home and abroad. Nobody can\r\nknow better than the compiler how far Mr. Ruskin's kindness led him in\r\nthe direction of over-indulgence.\r\n\r\nI can only hope that the later editions have been made--largely owing\r\nto the suggestions of critics and private correspondents--a little\r\nmore deserving of the kind reception which, now for a period of nearly\r\ntwenty-five years, has been given by the public to my Handbook.\r\n\r\n  E. T. C.\r\n\r\n  _May 1912._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The Tate Gallery is ten minutes' drive or twenty minutes' walk\r\nfrom Trafalgar Square. It is reached in a straight line by Whitehall,\r\nParliament Street, past the Houses of Parliament, Millbank Street, and\r\nGrosvenor Road.\r\n\r\n[2] Mr. Ruskin himself was converted by the acquisition of the great\r\nPerugino (No. 288). In congratulating the Trustees on their acquisition\r\nof this \"noble picture,\" he wrote: \"It at once, to my mind, raises our\r\nNational Gallery from a second-rate to a first-rate collection. I have\r\nalways loved the master, and given much time to the study of his works;\r\nbut this is the best I have ever seen\" (_Notes on the Turner Gallery_,\r\np. 89 _n._).\r\n\r\n[3] See, for instance, Nos. 10, 61, 193, 195, 479 and 498, 757, 790,\r\n896, 1131, and 1171.\r\n\r\n[4] The exterior of the building is not generally considered an\r\narchitectural success, and the ugliness of the dome is almost\r\nproverbial. But it should be remembered that the original design\r\nincluded the erection of suitable pieces of sculpture--such as may\r\nbe seen in old engravings of the Gallery, made from the architect's\r\ndrawings--on the still vacant pedestals.\r\n\r\n[5] The several extensions of the Gallery are shown in the plan on a\r\nlater page.\r\n\r\n[6] The total number should thus be 28; but in the reconstruction four\r\nsmaller rooms were thrown into two larger ones. The plan thus shows 25\r\nnumbered rooms and one called the \"Dome.\"\r\n\r\n[7] This sum only includes amounts paid out of Parliamentary grants or\r\nother National Gallery funds or special contributions.\r\n\r\n[8] In 1894, however, an alteration was made in the Minute, and the\r\nresponsibility for purchases was vested in the Director and the\r\nTrustees jointly.\r\n\r\n[9] Sir William Gregory relates in his _Autobiography_ the following\r\nstory: \"In 1884, when the Trustees were endeavouring to secure some of\r\nthe pre-eminently fine Rubenses from the Duke of Marlborough, Alfred\r\nRothschild met me in St. James's Street, and said, 'If you think the\r\nBlenheim Rubenses are more important than your Dutch pictures to the\r\nGallery, and that you cannot get the money from the Government, I am\r\nprepared to give you £250,000 for the Peel pictures; and I will hold\r\ngood to this offer till the day after to-morrow.'\"\r\n\r\n[10] Of the 1170 pieces thus unaccounted for (the total number\r\nbelonging to the Trustees being roughly 2870) the greater number are at\r\nMillbank. Others are on loan to provincial institutions (see App. II.).\r\n\r\n[11] With this object in view, several of them have been published with\r\ndescriptive letterpress by Mr. Sydney Vacher.\r\n\r\n[12] These contrasts were worked out and illustrated by Mr. Grant Allen\r\nin his papers on \"The Evolution of Italian Art\" in the _Pall Mall\r\nMagazine_ for 1895.\r\n\r\n[13] See _Raphael's Madonnas_, by Karl Károly, 1894.\r\n\r\n[14] Ruskin's _Modern Painters_ is of course the great book on this\r\nsubject. The evolution of \"Landscape in Art\" has been historically\r\ntreated by Mr. Josiah Gilbert in a work thus entitled, which contains\r\nnumerous illustrations from the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUIDE TO THE GALLERY\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTIONS TO THE SCHOOLS OF PAINTING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pictures in the National Gallery are hung methodically, so far\r\nas the wall-space and other circumstances will admit, in order to\r\nillustrate the different schools of painting, and to facilitate their\r\nhistorical study.

What, he\r\nmay be inclined to ask, is there worth looking at in the quaint and\r\ngaunt pictures around him here? The answer is a very simple one. This\r\nvestibule is the nursery of Italian art. Here is the first stammering\r\nof infant painting. Accustomed as we are at the present day to so much\r\ntechnical skill even in the commonest works of art, we may be inclined\r\nto think that the art of painting--the art of giving the resemblances\r\nof things by means of colour laid on to wood or canvas--is an easy\r\none, of which men have everywhere and at all times possessed the\r\nmastery. But this of course is not the case. The skill of to-day is\r\nthe acquired result of long centuries of gradual improvement; and the\r\npictures in this vestibule bear the same relation to the pictures of\r\nour own time as the stone huts of our forefathers to the Gallery in\r\nwhich we stand. The poorness of the pictures here is the measure of the\r\nrichness of others. To feel the full greatness of Raphael's Madonna\r\n(1171), one should first pause awhile before the earliest Italian\r\npicture here (564), the gaunt and forbidding Madonna by\r\n\r\n    Margaritone of Arezzo,\r\n      With the grave-clothes garb and swaddling barret\r\n    (Why purse up mouth and beak in a pet so,\r\n      You bald old saturnine poll-clawed parrot?) (_R. Browning_).\r\n\r\nBut even in the earliest efforts of infancy, there is a certain\r\namount of inherited gift. First of all, therefore, one should look at\r\na specimen of such art as Italians had before them when they first\r\nbegan to paint for themselves. With the fall of the Roman Empire\r\nand the invasion of the Goths, the centre of civilisation shifted\r\nto the capital of the Eastern Church, Byzantium (Constantinople).\r\nThe characteristics of Byzantine art may be seen in a Greek picture\r\n(594). The history of early Italian art is the history of the effort\r\nto escape from the swaddling clothes of this rigid Byzantine School.\r\nThe effort was of two kinds: first the painters had to see nature\r\ntruly, instead of contenting themselves with fixed symbols--art had to\r\nbecome \"natural,\" instead of \"conventional.\" Secondly, having learned\r\nto see truly, they had to learn how to give a true resemblance of\r\nwhat they saw; how to exhibit things in relief, in perspective, and\r\nin illumination. In _relief_: that is, they had to learn to show one\r\nthing as standing out from another; in _perspective_: that is, to\r\nshow things as they really look, instead of as we infer they are; in\r\n_illumination_: that is, to show things in the colours they assume\r\nunder such and such lights. The first distinct advance was made by\r\nCimabue and Giotto at Florence, but contemporaneous with them was the\r\nsimilar work of Duccio and his successors at Siena, whose pictures\r\nshould be studied in this connection. Various stages in the advance\r\nwill be pointed out under the pictures themselves; and the student\r\nof art will perhaps find the same kind of pleasure in tracing the\r\npainter's progress as grown-up people feel in watching the gradual\r\ndevelopment of children.\r\n\r\nBut there is another kind of interest also. Wordsworth says that\r\nchildren are the best philosophers; and in the case of art at any\r\nrate there is some truth in what he says, for \"this is a general\r\nlaw, that supposing the intellect of the workman the same, the more\r\nimitatively complete his art, the less he will mean by it; and the\r\nruder the symbol, the deeper is its intention\" (Ruskin's _Lectures on\r\nArt_, § 19). The more complete his powers of imitation become, the\r\nmore intellectual interest he takes in the expression, and the less\r\ntherefore in the thing meant. What then is the meaning of these early\r\npictures? To answer this question, we must go back to consider what\r\nit was that gave the original impulse to the revival of art in Italy.\r\nTo this revival two circumstances contributed. First, no school of\r\npainting can exist until society is comparatively rich, until there\r\nis wealth enough to support a class of men with leisure to produce\r\nbeautiful things. Such an increase of wealth took place at Florence in\r\nthe thirteenth century: the gay and courteous life of the Florentines\r\nat that time was ready for the adornment of art. The particular\r\ndirection which art took was due to the religious revival, headed by\r\nSt. Francis and St. Dominic, which occurred at the same time. Churches\r\nwere everywhere built, and on the church walls frescoes were wanted,\r\nalike to satisfy the growing sense of beauty and to assist in teaching\r\nChristian doctrine. These early pictures are thus to be considered as\r\na kind of painted preaching. The story of Cimabue's great picture (see\r\nNo. 565) well illustrates the double origin of the revival of art. It\r\nwas to its place above the altar in the great Dominican church of Sta.\r\nMaria Novella at Florence that the picture was carried in triumphal\r\nprocession; whilst the fact that a whole city should thus have turned\r\nout to rejoice over the completion of a picture, proves \"the widespread\r\nsensibility of the Florentines to things of beauty, and shows the\r\nsympathy which, emanating from the people, was destined to inspire and\r\nbrace the artist for his work\" (Symonds: _Renaissance_, iii. 137).[15]\r\nThe history of Giotto is no less significant. It was for the walls of\r\nthe church of St. Francis at Assisi that his greatest work was done. It\r\nwas there that he at once pondered over the meaning of the Christian\r\nfaith (with what result is shown by Ruskin in _Fors Clavigera_ and\r\nelsewhere), and learned the secret of giving the resemblance of the\r\nobjects of that faith in painting. Thus, then, we arrive at the second\r\nsource of interest in these old pictures of Florence--rude and foolish\r\nas they sometimes seem. \"Those were noble days for the painter, when\r\nthe whole belief of Christendom, grasped by his own faith, and firmly\r\nrooted in the faith of the people round him, as yet unimpaired by alien\r\nemanations from the world of classic culture, had to be set forth for\r\nthe first time in art. His work was then a Bible, a compendium of grave\r\ndivinity and human history, a book embracing all things needful for\r\nthe spiritual and civil life of man. He spoke to men who could not\r\nread, for whom there were no printed pages, but whose hearts received\r\nhis teaching through the eye. Thus painting was not then what it is\r\nnow, a decoration of existence, but a potent and efficient agent in\r\nthe education of the race\" (_ibid._ p. 143). The message which these\r\npainters had to deliver was painted on the walls of churches or civic\r\nbuildings; and it is only there--at Assisi, and Padua, and Florence,\r\nand Siena--that they can be properly read. But from such scraps and\r\nfragments as are here preserved, one may learn, as it were, the\r\nalphabet, and catch the necessary point of view.\r\n\r\nBut why, it may be asked, did painting come to its new birth first at\r\nFlorence, rather than elsewhere in Italy? The first answer is that\r\npainting thus arose at Florence because it was there that a new style\r\nof building at this time arose. The painters were wanted, as we have\r\nseen, to decorate the churches, and in those days there was no sharp\r\ndistinction between the arts. Not only were architects sculptors, but\r\nthey were often painters and goldsmiths as well. Giotto and Orcagna\r\nare instances of this union of the arts. But why did the new style of\r\nbuilding arise specially in Florence? The answer to this is twofold:\r\nfirst, the Florentines inherited the artistic gifts and faculties of\r\nthe Etruscan (Tuscan) race. Even in late Florentine pictures, pure\r\nEtruscan design will often be found surviving (see 586). Secondly, in\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century new art impulse came from the\r\nNorth in the shape of a northern builder, who, after building Assisi,\r\nvisited Florence and instructed Arnolfo in Gothic, as opposed to Greek\r\narchitecture. Thus there met the two principles of art--the Norman (or\r\nLombard), vigorous and savage; the Greek (or Byzantine), contemplative\r\nbut sterile. The new spirit in Florence \"adopts what is best in each,\r\nand gives to what it adopts a new energy of its own, ... collects and\r\nanimates the Norman and Byzantine tradition, and forms out of the\r\nperfected worship and work of both, the honest Christian faith and\r\nvital craftsmanship of the world.... Central stood Etruscan Florence:\r\nagricultural in occupation, religious in thought, she directed the\r\nindustry of the Northman into the arts of peace; kindled the dreams\r\nof the Byzantine with the fire of charity. Child of her peace, and\r\nexponent of her passion, her Cimabue became the interpreter to mankind\r\nof the meaning of the Birth of Christ\" (_Ariadne Florentina_, ch. ii.;\r\n_Mornings in Florence_, ii. 44, 45).\r\n\r\n      --> _In the left-hand corner of the Vestibule will be found a\r\n      very remarkable series of archaic Greek portraits dating from\r\n      the second or third century A.D. (Nos. 1260-1270)._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the Entrance Hall and Vestibule is worth some\r\nattention, for here is the finest collection of marbles in London.\r\nMany distant parts of the world have contributed to it. The Alps, from\r\na steep face of mountain 2000 feet high on the Simplon Pass, send the\r\ntwo massive square pillars of light green \"cipollino\" which form the\r\napproach to the Vestibule from the Square. Their carved capitals are of\r\nalabaster from Derbyshire, whilst the bases on which they stand are of\r\nCorrennie granite from near Aberdeen. The square blocks of bluish gray\r\nbeneath the upper columns come from New Zealand. Ascending the stone\r\nsteps, the visitor should notice the side walls, built up of squares\r\nof \"giallo antico,\" which was brought from the quarry at Simittu, in\r\nthe territory of Tunis. It had long been known that Rome was full of\r\nthe beautiful \"giallo antico,\" sometimes yellow, sometimes rosy in\r\ncolour, but always of exquisite texture and even to work. It had come\r\nfrom the province of Africa; and the quarry was rediscovered by a\r\nBelgian engineer working on the railway then being made from Tunis to\r\nthe Algerian frontier. He observed at Simittu a half-consumed mountain\r\nwith gaps clearly marked, from which the last monoliths had been cut,\r\nand the work of the Romans was presently resumed by a Belgian Company.\r\nNo more beautiful specimen of the \"giallo antico\" similar to that used\r\nin Augustan Rome could be desired than slabs in the entrance to the\r\nNational Gallery. The cornice above the \"giallo antico\" walls is of\r\n\"pavonazzetto\" from the Apennines, near Pisa, and the same marble forms\r\nthe base of the red columns. These splendid columns come from quarries\r\nnear Chenouah, just west of Algiers, which were first opened by the\r\nFrench some years ago. Red Etruscan is the unmeaning trade name of this\r\njasper-like stone, which is also used for door frames in many of the\r\nnew rooms with very sumptuous effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] My references to this book are to the new edition of 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLORENTINE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n      \"This is the way people look when they feel this or that--when\r\n      they have this or that other mental character: are they\r\n      devotional, thoughtful, affectionate, indignant, or inspired?\r\n      are they prophets, saints, priests, or kings? then--whatsoever\r\n      is truly thoughtful, affectionate, prophetic, priestly,\r\n      kingly--_that_ the Florentine School lived to discern and show;\r\n      _that_ they have discerned and shown; and all their greatness\r\n      is first fastened in their aim at this central truth--the open\r\n      expression of the living human soul\" (RUSKIN: _Two Paths_, §\r\n      21).\r\n\r\n    Each face obedient to its passion's law,\r\n      Each passion clear proclaimed without a tongue.\r\n\r\n  ROBERT BROWNING: _Pictor Ignotus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Great nations write their autobiographies in three manuscripts;--the\r\nbook of their deeds, the book of their words, and the book of their\r\nart. Not one of these books can be understood unless we read the two\r\nothers; but of the three, the only quite trustworthy one is the last.\"\r\nThe reason for this faithfulness in the record of art is twofold. The\r\nart of any nation can only be great \"by the general gifts and common\r\nsympathies of the race;\" and secondly, \"art is always instinctive, and\r\nthe honesty or pretence of it therefore open to the day\" (_St. Mark's\r\nRest_, Preface). It has been seen from the remarks already made how\r\nFlorentine art in its infancy was thus in a certain sense a record\r\nof the times out of which it sprang. In the later pictures, we may\r\ntrace some of the developments which characterised the inner history\r\nof Florence in succeeding stages. The first thing that will strike\r\nany one who takes a general look at the early Florentine pictures and\r\nthen at the later, is the fact that easel pictures have now superseded\r\nfragments of fresco and altar-pieces. Here at once we see reflected\r\ntwo features of the time of the Renaissance. Pictures were no longer\r\nwanted merely for church decoration and Scripture teaching; there\r\nwas a growing taste for beautiful things as household possessions.\r\nAnd then also the influence of the church itself was declining; the\r\nexclusive place hitherto occupied by religion as a motive for art was\r\nbeing superseded by the revival of classical learning. Benozzo Gozzoli\r\npaints the Rape of Helen, Botticelli paints Mars and Venus, Piero di\r\nCosimo paints the Death of Procris, and Pollajuolo the story of Apollo\r\nand Daphne. The Renaissance was, however, \"a new birth\" in another way\r\nthan this; it opened men's eyes not only to the learning of the ancient\r\nworld, but to the beauties of the world in which they themselves lived.\r\nIn previous times the burden of serious and thoughtful minds had been,\r\n\"The world is very evil, the times are waxing late;\" the burden of the\r\nnew song is, \"The world is very beautiful.\" Thus we see the painters\r\nno longer confined to a fixed cycle of subjects represented with the\r\ntraditional surroundings, but ranging at will over everything that they\r\nfound beautiful or interesting around them. And above all they took\r\nto representing the noblest embodiment of life--the human form. Some\r\nattempts at portraiture may be perceived in the saints of the earliest\r\npictures; but here we find professed portraits on every wall. This\r\nindeed was one of the chief glories of the Florentine School--\"the open\r\nexpression of the living human soul.\" This widening and secularising of\r\nart did not pass in Florence, as we know, without a protest; and here,\r\ntoo, history is painted on the walls. Some of the protest was silent,\r\nas Angelico's, who painted on through a later generation in the old\r\nspirit; some of it was vocal, in the fiery eloquence of Savonarola,\r\nwhose influence may be seen in Botticelli's work (1034).\r\n\r\nBut the development went on, all protests notwithstanding; for as\r\nthe life of every nation runs its appointed course, so does its art;\r\nand the second point of interest in studying a school of painting\r\nis to watch its successive periods of birth, growth, maturity, and\r\ndecay. In no school is this development so completely marked as in\r\nthe Florentine, which for this reason, as well as for its priority in\r\ntime, and therefore influence on succeeding schools, takes precedence\r\nof all others. The _first_ period--covering roughly the fourteenth\r\ncentury, called the Giottesque, from its principal master--is that in\r\nwhich the thing told is of more importance than the manner of telling\r\nit, and in which the religious sentiment dominated the plastic faculty.\r\nIn the _second_ period, covering roughly the fifteenth century, and\r\ncalled by the Italians the period of the _quattro-centisti_,[16] the\r\nartist, beginning as we have seen to look freely at the world around\r\nhim, begins also to study deeply with a view to represent nature more\r\nexactly. One may see the new passion for the scientific study of the\r\nart in Paolo Uccello (583), who devoted himself to perspective; and\r\nin Pollajuolo (292), who first studied anatomy from the dead body. It\r\nis customary to group the Florentine artists of this scientific and\r\nrealistic period under three heads, according to the main tendencies\r\nwhich they severally exhibit. The first group aimed especially at\r\n\"action, movement, and the expression of intense passions.\" The artist\r\nwho stands at the head of this group, Masaccio, is, unhappily, not\r\nrepresented in the National Gallery, but the descent from him is\r\nrepresented by Fra Filippo Lippi, Pesellino, Botticelli, Filippino\r\nLippi. The second group aimed rather at \"realistic probability, and\r\ncorrectness in hitting off the characteristics of individual things,\"\r\nand is represented by Cosimo Rosselli, Piero di Cosimo, Ghirlandajo,\r\nAndrea del Sarto, Francia Bigio. Thirdly, some of the Florentine\r\nSchool were directly influenced by the work of contemporary sculptors.\r\nChief amongst this group are Pollajuolo, Verocchio, himself a sculptor,\r\nand Lorenzo di Credi. We come now to the _third_ stage in the\r\nFlorentine, as in every other vital school of painting. This period\r\nwitnesses the perfection of the technical processes of the art, and\r\nthe attempt of the painter to \"raise forms, imitated by the artists of\r\nthe preceding period from nature, to ideal beauty, and to give to the\r\nrepresentations of the sentiments and affections the utmost grace and\r\nenergy.\" The great Florentine masters of this culminating period are\r\nLeonardo da Vinci and Michael Angelo. The former is especially typical\r\nof this stage of development. \"When a nation's culture has reached its\r\nculminating point, we see everywhere,\" says Morelli,[17] \"in daily life\r\nas well as in literature and art, that _grace_[18] comes to be valued\r\nmore than _character_. So it was in Italy during the closing decades\r\nof the fifteenth century and the opening ones of the sixteenth. To no\r\nartist was it given to express this feeling so fully as to the great\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, perhaps the most richly gifted man that mother\r\nNature ever made. He was the first who tried to express the smile of\r\ninward happiness, the sweetness of the soul.\" But this culminating\r\nperiod of art already contained within it the germs of decay. The very\r\nperfection of the technical processes of painting caused in all, except\r\npainters of the highest mental gifts, a certain deadness and coldness,\r\nsuch as Browning makes Andrea del Sarto (1487-1531) be conscious of in\r\nhis own works; the \"faultless painter\" as compared with others less\r\ntechnically perfect but more full of soul (see under 690). Moreover the\r\nvery fascination of the great men, the pleasure in imitating their\r\ntechnical skill, led to decay. Grace soon passed into insipidity, and\r\nthe dramatic energy of Michael Angelo into exaggerated violence. One\r\nmannerism led to another until the school of the \"Eclectics\" sought to\r\nunite the mannerisms of all, and Italian art, having run its course,\r\nbecame extinct.[19]\r\n\r\nThe growth and decay of painting described above is connected by Ruskin\r\nwith a corresponding growth and decay in religion. He divides the\r\ncourse of mediæval art into two stages: the first stage (covering the\r\nfirst two periods above) \"is that of the formation of conscience by the\r\ndiscovery of the true laws of social order and personal virtue, coupled\r\nwith sincere effort to live by such laws as they are discovered. All\r\nthe Arts advance steadily during this stage of national growth, and\r\nare lovely, even in their deficiencies, as the buds of flowers are\r\nlovely by their vital force, swift change, and continent beauty. The\r\nnext stage is that in which the conscience is entirely formed, and\r\nthe nation, finding it painful to live in obedience to the precepts\r\nit has discovered, looks about to discover, also, a compromise for\r\nobedience to them. In this condition of mind its first endeavour is\r\nnearly always to make its religion pompous, and please the gods by\r\ngiving them gifts and entertainments, in which it may piously and\r\npleasurably share itself; so that a magnificent display of the powers\r\nof art it has gained by sincerity, takes place for a few years, and\r\nis then followed by their extinction, rapid and complete exactly in\r\nthe degree in which the nation resigns itself to hypocrisy. The works\r\nof Raphael, Michael Angelo, and Tintoret, belong to this period of\r\ncompromise in the career of the greatest nation of the world; and are\r\nthe most splendid efforts yet made by human creatures to maintain the\r\ndignity of states with beautiful colours, and defend the doctrines\r\nof theology with anatomical designs.\" It is easy to see how the\r\nprogress in realism led to a decline in religion. \"The greater the\r\n(painter's) powers became, the more (his) mind was absorbed in their\r\nattainment, and complacent in their display. The early arts of laying\r\non bright colours smoothly, of burnishing golden ornaments, or tracing,\r\nleaf by leaf, the outlines of flowers, were not so difficult as that\r\nthey should materially occupy the thoughts of the artist, or furnish\r\nfoundation for his conceit; he learned these rudiments of his work\r\nwithout pain, and employed them without pride, his spirit being left\r\nfree to express, so far as it was capable of them, the reaches of\r\nhigher thought. But when accurate shade, and subtle colour, and perfect\r\nanatomy, and complicated perspective, became necessary to the work, the\r\nartist's whole energy was employed in learning the laws of these, and\r\nhis whole pleasure consisted in exhibiting them. His life was devoted,\r\nnot to the objects of art, but to the cunning of it; and the sciences\r\nof composition and light and shade were pursued as if there were\r\nabstract good in them;--as if, like astronomy or mathematics, they were\r\nends in themselves, irrespective of anything to be effected by them.\r\nAnd without perception, on the part of any one, of the abyss to which\r\nall were hastening, a fatal change of aim took place throughout the\r\nwhole world of art. In early times _art was employed for the display of\r\nreligious facts_; now, _religious facts were employed for the display\r\nof art_. The transition, though imperceptible, was consummate; it\r\ninvolved the entire destiny of painting. It was passing from the paths\r\nof life to the paths of death\" (_Relation between Michael Angelo and\r\nTintoret_, pp. 8, 9, and _Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. iv.\r\n§ 11.

There\r\nis a \"Madonna\" at Siena, painted in 1281, which is decidedly superior\r\nto such work as Margaritone's (564). But the start which Siena obtained\r\nat first was soon lost; and at a time when Florentine art was finding\r\nnew directions, that at Siena was running still in the old grooves.\r\nThis was owing to the markedly religious character of its painting,\r\nshown in the tone of the statutes above quoted. Such religious fervour\r\nseems at first sight inconsistent with the character of a people who\r\nwere famed for factious quarrels and delicate living.[20] But \"the\r\ncontradiction is more apparent than real. The people of Siena were\r\nhighly impressible and emotional, quick to obey the promptings of their\r\npassion, whether it took the form of hatred or of love, of spiritual\r\nfervour or of carnal violence. The religious feeling was a passion\r\nwith them, on a par with all the other movements of their quick and\r\nmobile temperament.\"[21] Sienese art reflects this spirit; it is like\r\nthe religion of their St. Catherine, rapt and ecstatic. The early\r\nFlorentine pictures are not very dissimilar; but in Siena the same kind\r\nof art lasted much longer. In the work, for instance, of Matteo di\r\nGiovanni (see 1155), there is still the same expression of religious\r\necstasy, and the same prodigal use of gold in the background, as marked\r\nthe works of the preceding century; yet he was contemporary with the\r\nFlorentine Botticelli, who introduced many new motives into art. Matteo\r\nwas the best Sienese painter of the fifteenth century, and with him the\r\nindependent school of Siena comes to an end. Girolamo del Pacchia (246)\r\nbetrays the influence of Florence; whilst Il Sodoma (1144), who settled\r\nat Siena and had many pupils, was not a native, and shows in his style\r\nno affinity with the true Sienese School. Peruzzi (218), on the other\r\nhand, was a native of Siena, but belongs in his artistic development to\r\nthe Roman School.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] See Dante, _Inferno_ xxix. 121. There was, moreover, in Siena\r\na \"Prodigal Club,\" and a poet of the day wrote a series of sonnets\r\n(translated by D. G. Rossetti) \"Unto the blithe and lordly fellowship.\"\r\n\r\n[21] _History of the Renaissance in Italy_, iii. 161.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOLS OF LOMBARDY\r\n\r\n      Painters of \"the loveliest district of North Italy, where\r\n      hills, and streams, and air, meet in softest harmonies\"\r\n      (RUSKIN: _Queen of the Air_, § 157).\r\n\r\n    'Twere pleasant could Correggio's fleeting glow\r\n    Hang full in face of one where'er one roams,\r\n    Since he more than the others brings with him\r\n    Italy's self,--the marvellous Modenese!\r\n\r\n  BROWNING: _Bishop Blougram's Apology_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loose use of the term \"school\" has caused much confusion in the\r\nhistory and criticism of art. Sometimes the term is used with reference\r\nonly to the place where such and such painters principally worked.\r\nThus Raphael and Michael Angelo, together with their followers, are\r\nsometimes called the \"Roman School.\" But Rome produced no great\r\nnative painters; she was merely a centre to which painters were drawn\r\nfrom elsewhere. So too when the phrase \"Milanese School\" occurs, it\r\ngenerally means Leonardo da Vinci and his immediate pupils, because,\r\nthough a Florentine, he taught at Milan. Sometimes, again, the term\r\n\"school\" is used as mere geographical expression. Thus under \"Lombard\r\nSchool\" are often included the painters of Parma, simply because Parma\r\nis contiguous to Lombardy. A third use of the term school, however, is\r\nthat in which it means \"a definite quality, native to the district,\r\nshared through many generations by all its painters, and culminating\r\nin a few men of commanding genius.\" Such a definite quality is\r\ngenerally marked by \"a special collection of traditions, and processes,\r\na particular method, a peculiar style in design, and an equally\r\npeculiar taste in colouring--all contributing to the representation\r\nof a national ideal existing in the minds of the artists of the same\r\ncountry at the same time.\" This is the use of the term which is\r\nsuggested by the main arrangement of the National Gallery, and which is\r\nat once the most instructive and the most interesting.\r\n\r\nFollowing this principle in the case of the present chapter, we\r\nmust first dispose of the \"pseudo-Lombards\"--the Cremonese, namely,\r\nand Correggio. The pictures belonging to artists of Cremona are, as\r\nwill be seen below, practically Venetian. Correggio and his imitator\r\nParmigiano are more difficult to deal with. The truth is that Correggio\r\nstands very much apart (see under 10); but if he must be labelled,\r\nit seems best to follow Morelli and class him, on the score of his\r\nearly training, with the Ferrarese. Coming now to the genuine Lombard\r\nSchool, one sees by looking round the room that it is by no means\r\nidentical with Leonardo da Vinci. He himself was a Florentine, who\r\nsettled at Milan, and whose powerful individuality exercised a strong\r\ninfluence on succeeding painters there. But before his coming, there\r\nwas a native Lombard School--with artists scattered about in the towns\r\nand villages around Milan, and with a distinct style of its own. Long\r\nbefore Leonardo came to settle at Milan, the Lombard Madonnas--with\r\ntheir long oval faces and somewhat simpering smile--have already what\r\nwe now describe as a \"Leonardesque character.\" Among technical points\r\nwe may notice as characteristic of the Lombard School, in its earlier\r\nphases, a partiality for sombre tints and high finish in the rendering\r\nof detail. In spirit the School is characterised by great simplicity of\r\nfeeling. It will be noticed that among the Milanese pictures there are\r\nfew with any allegorical or mythological subject. Even after Leonardo\r\ncame to Milan, bringing with him new motives and a wide curiosity, the\r\nnative Lombard masters, such as Luini and Gaudenzio Ferrari, adhered\r\nin the main to sacred subjects. The Lombard School, it should be\r\nobserved, was late in arising. The building of Milan Cathedral and the\r\nCertosa of Pavia in the first part of the fifteenth century directed\r\nthe art-impulse of the time rather to sculpture, and it was not till\r\nabout 1450 that Vincenzo Foppa came from Brescia and established the\r\nprincipal school of painting at Milan. Other schools started with\r\nspiritual aims, which wore off, as it were, under the new pleasure of\r\nsharpening their means of execution; but the Lombards first took up\r\nthe art when it had already been reduced to a science. And then most\r\nof the painters were natives, not of some large capital, but of small\r\ntowns or country villages. Thus Luini was born on the Lago Maggiore,\r\nand the traditions of his life all murmur about the lake district. But\r\nhe learned technique at Milan; and thus came to \"stand alone,\" adds\r\nRuskin, \"in uniting consummate art power with untainted simplicity of\r\nreligious imagination\" (see references under 18).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the historical development of the school, it was\r\nfounded, as we have seen, by Vincenzo Foppa, \"the Mantegna of the\r\nLombard School.\" Borgognone, his pupil, was its Perugino. Then came\r\nLeonardo from Florence, and the school divides into two sets--those\r\nwho were immediately and directly his imitators, and those who,\r\nwhilst feeling his influence, yet preserved the independent Lombard\r\ntraditions. The visitor will have no difficulty in recognising the\r\npictures of Beltraffio, Oggionno, and Martino Piazza as belonging to\r\nthe former class. Solario, Luini, and Lanini are more independent.\r\nLastly Sodoma, a pupil of Leonardo, went off to Siena and established\r\na second Sienese School there, which is represented at the National\r\nGallery by Peruzzi (218).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFERRARESE AND BOLOGNESE SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n      \"One may almost apply to the School of Ferrara the proud boast\r\n      of its ducal House of Este--\r\n\r\n    Whoe'er in Italy is known to fame,\r\n    This lordly house as frequent guest can claim.\"\r\n\r\n  _Guidebook._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Schools of Ferrara and Bologna, which, as will be seen, are\r\nsubstantially one and the same, are interesting both for themselves\r\nand for their influence on others. Two of the greatest of all Italian\r\npainters--Correggio and Raphael--may be claimed as \"guests,\" as it\r\nwere, of \"this lordly\" school. Correggio's master was Francesco\r\nBianchi of Ferrara, a scholar of Cosimo Tura, and may possibly have\r\nafterwards studied under Francia at Bologna;[22] whilst as for Raphael,\r\nhis master, Timoteo Viti, was also a pupil of Francia. The important\r\ninfluence of this school is natural enough, for the Ferrarese appear\r\nto have had much innate genius for art, and there is a note of\r\nunmistakable originality in their work.\r\n\r\n\"The Art of the Emilia, the region that lies between the river Po and\r\nthe Apennines, has been unduly neglected. Here there once dwelt a\r\nvigorous and gifted race, as original in their way as the Umbrians,\r\nTuscans or Venetians, who found means of self-expression in form and\r\ncolour under the political security of the Court of Este, and whose\r\nart forms an organic whole with stages of development and decay,\r\ncharacteristically differing, like their dialect, from that of other\r\nparts of Italy.... The traveller visiting the now deserted city of\r\nFerrara, who meditates on its records of the past, may still in fancy\r\nsee erected again the triumphal arches which welcomed emperors, popes\r\nand princes in the 'quattro-cento'; the gilded barges ascending the\r\nriver to the city; the platforms draped with the arras, on which were\r\nwoven in gold and silk stories of cavaliers in tilt and tourney; the\r\nduke in his robes, stiff with brocade of gold and covered with gems,\r\nbearing a jewelled sceptre in his hand; the magnificently caparisoned\r\nsteeds; the princesses who came in their chariots of triumph, to be\r\nbrides of the house of Este.... To trace the various processes, alike\r\nof thought, feeling and technique, which have gone to the making of a\r\nmasterpiece of Correggio, L'Ortolano or Dosso is a fascinating pursuit.\r\nOnly through knowledge of the tentative efforts of their predecessors\r\nat the splendid jovial court of the Este, is it possible to get a\r\ntotal impression. Born, as elsewhere, in bondage to rigid types and\r\nforms of composition, Ferrarese genius began by being profoundly\r\ndramatic and realistic. The masters of 1450 to 1475, well grounded\r\nin geometry, perspective and anatomy, painted rather what they saw\r\nthan what they felt. Their aim was to conventionalise Nature rather\r\nthan to transfigure her, and truth was more to them than beauty. The\r\nnext generation, 1475 to 1500, developed technique so as to express\r\nmovement and emotion, tempered by the eternal charm of antique ideals,\r\ntill upon this sure foundation there arose men of high imagination and\r\nsentiment, who grasped and solved the mysteries of tone and colour, as\r\ndistinguished from a brilliant palette\" (R. H. Benson and A. Venturi\r\nin Burlington Fine Arts Club's Catalogue, 1894). Of the first or\r\nGiottesque period of the school no pictures survive, and the founder\r\nof the school, so far as we can now study it, is Cosimo Tura, who\r\noccupies the same place in the art of Ferrara as Piero della Francesca\r\noccupied in that of Umbria, or Mantegna in that of Padua. Look at his\r\npicture (772): one sees at once that here is something different from\r\nother pictures, one feels that one would certainly be able to recognise\r\nthat \"rugged, gnarled, and angular\" but vigorous style again. Doubtless\r\nthere was some Flemish influence upon the school (see the notes on\r\nTura, No. 772); and doubtless also the Ferrarese were influenced by\r\nthe neighbouring school of Squarcione at Padua. But the pictures of\r\nTura are enough to show how large an original element of native genius\r\nthere was. The later developments of this genius are well illustrated\r\nin this room, with the important exception that Dosso Dossi, the\r\ngreatest colourist amongst the Ferrarese masters, is very incompletely\r\nrepresented. His best works are to be seen at Ferrara, Dresden,\r\nFlorence, and the Borghese Palace. He has been called \"the Titian\r\nof the Ferrarese School,\" just as Lorenzo Costa has been called its\r\nPerugino and Garofalo its Raphael. Such phrases are useful as helping\r\nthe student to compare corresponding pictures in different schools, and\r\nthus to appreciate their characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe early Bolognese School does not really exist except as an offshoot\r\nof the Ferrarese. Marco Zoppo (590) was \"no better,\" says Morelli,\r\n\"than a caricature of his master, Squarcione, and besides, he spent the\r\ngreater part of his life at Venice;\" whilst Lippo Dalmasii (752) was\r\nvery inferior to contemporary artists elsewhere. The so-called earlier\r\nBolognese School was really founded by the Ferrarese Francesco Cossa\r\nand Lorenzo Costa, who moved to Bologna about 1480, and the latter of\r\nwhom \"set up shop\" with Francia in that town (see under 629). Remarks\r\non the later \"Eclectic\" School of Bologna, formed by the Carracci, may\r\nmore conveniently be deferred (see p. 35)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] See for Correggio's connection with the Ferrarese-Bolognese\r\nSchool, Morelli's _German Galleries_, pp. 120-124.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UMBRIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n      \"More allied to the Tuscan than to the Venetian spirit, the\r\n      Umbrian masters produced a style of genuine originality. The\r\n      cities of the Central Apennines owed their specific quality\r\n      of religious fervour to the influences emanating from Assisi,\r\n      the headquarters of the _cultus_ of St. Francis. This pietism,\r\n      nowhere else so paramount, except for a short period in Siena,\r\n      constitutes the individuality of Umbria\" (J. A. SYMONDS:\r\n      _Renaissance in Italy_, iii. 133).\r\n\r\n    Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth\r\n    The Urbinate...\r\n    Well, I can fancy how he did it all,\r\n    Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see,\r\n    Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him,\r\n    Above and through his art....\r\n\r\n  BROWNING: _Andrea del Sarto_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Umbrian School, unlike the Florentine, was distinctively\r\nprovincial; painting was not centralised in any great capital, but\r\nflourished in small towns and retired valleys--in Perugia, Foligno,\r\nBorgo S. Sepolcro, S. Severino, Rimini (see 2118), etc. Hence the\r\nolder traditions of Italian art held their ground, and the religious\r\nfeeling of the Middle Ages survived long after it had elsewhere been\r\nsuperseded. This tendency was confirmed by the spirit of the district.\r\nThe little townships of Umbria begirdle the Hill of Assisi, the\r\nhallowed abode of St. Francis, and were the peculiar seats of religious\r\nenthusiasm. Art followed the current of life, just as it did in\r\nFlorence or Venice or Padua; and Umbria--\"the Galilee,\" as it has been\r\ncalled, \"of Italy\"--thus produced a distinct type in painting, marked\r\nby a quality of sentimental pietism. The influence of Siena, whose\r\nartists worked at Perugia, must have made in the same direction, and it\r\nis interesting to notice in this room one picture of St. Catherine of\r\nSiena (249), and two of her namesake of Alexandria (693, 168). It is\r\ninteresting, further, to notice how the \"purist\" style of landscape,\r\nidentified with this pietistic art (see under 288), is characteristic\r\nof the district itself. \"Whoever visits the hill-town of Perugia will\r\nbe struck,\" says Morelli, \"with two things: the fine, lovely voices\r\nof the women, and the view that opens before the enraptured eye, over\r\nthe whole valley, from the spot where the old castle stood of yore. On\r\nyour left, perched on a projecting hill that leans against the bare\r\nsunburnt down, lies Assisi, the birthplace of S. Francis, where first\r\nhis fiery soul was kindled to enthusiasm, where his sister Clara led\r\na pious life, and finally found her grave. Lower down, the eye can\r\nstill reach Spello and its neighbouring Foligno, while the range of\r\nhills, on whose ridge Montefalco looks out from the midst of its gray\r\nolives, closes the charming picture. This is the gracious nook of\r\nearth, the smiling landscape, in which Pietro Perugino loves to place\r\nhis chaste, God-fraught Madonnas, and which in his pictures, like soft\r\nmusic, heightens the mood awakened in us by his martyrs pining after\r\nParadise\" (_German Galleries_, p. 252). \"All is wrought,\" says another\r\nwriter, \"into a quietude and harmony that seem eternal. This is one\r\nof the mysterious charms in the Holy Families of Raffaelle and of the\r\nearly painters before him: the faces of the Madonnas are beyond the\r\ndiscomposure of passion, and their very draperies betoken an Elysian\r\natmosphere which wind never blew\" (_Letters of Edward FitzGerald_, i.\r\n45). Such were the local circumstances of the art which, beginning with\r\nthe almost grotesque pietism of Niccolò da Foligno (1107), led up to\r\nthe \"purist ideal\" of Perugino and to the first manner of Raphael.\r\n\r\nThe scattered character of Umbrian art above referred to makes it\r\nimpossible for us to trace its course historically. From that point of\r\nview each of the local schools would have to be treated separately. Of\r\nthe local schools which were the earliest to develop--Gubbio, Fabriano,\r\nand S. Severine--the first two are not represented here at all, and the\r\nthird has only one picture (249). The taste for art amongst the people\r\nof Perugia was much later in developing itself. Even up to 1440 they\r\nhad to rely on Sienese artists; and later still they sent for Piero\r\ndella Francesca, of Borgo S. Sepolcro, who had studied at Florence and\r\nhad greatly advanced the science of perspective. Many of the Umbrian\r\nmasters--Melozzo, Palmezzano, Fra Carnovale, Giovanni Santi, and even\r\nperhaps Perugino, were pupils of his. The earliest native artist of\r\nPerugia in the gallery is Fiorenzo di Lorenzo (1103), who, however,\r\nowed much to the Florentine Benozzo Gozzoli. This Fiorenzo was probably\r\nthe master of Pinturicchio. The latter worked for some time under\r\nPerugino, who had studied under Piero della Francesca and afterwards\r\nhimself went to study in Florence. Perugino in his turn was the\r\nmaster, after Timoteo Viti, of Raphael. The development of Raphael's\r\nart, leading in its later periods to directions far removed from the\r\nUmbrian ideal, is traced under the biographical notice of that master\r\n(1171). We have thus completed the circle of the principal Umbrian\r\nmasters. They are allied, as it will have been seen, by teaching, to\r\nthe Florentines, but they retained a distinctive character throughout.\r\nThe one exception in this respect is Luca Signorelli, who, though he\r\nwas apprenticed to Piero della Francesca, was born nearer to Florence,\r\nand whose affinities are far more with the Florentine than with the\r\nUmbrian School.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VENETIAN AND ALLIED SCHOOLS[23]\r\n\r\n      \"The Venetian School proposed to itself the representation\r\n      of the effect of colour and shade on all things; chiefly on\r\n      the human form. Here you have the most perfect representation\r\n      possible of colour, and light, and shade, as they affect\r\n      the external aspect of the human form, and its immediate\r\n      accessories, architecture, furniture, and dress. This external\r\n      aspect of noblest nature was the first aim of the Venetians,\r\n      and all their greatness depended on their patience in achieving\r\n      it\" (RUSKIN: _Two Paths_, §§ 20, 22).\r\n\r\n    Diego answered thus: \"I saw in Venice\r\n        The true test of the good and beautiful;\r\n        First, in my judgment, ever stands that school,\r\n    And Titian first of all Italian men is.\"\r\n\r\n  VELAZQUEZ, reported by Boschini, in curious Italian\r\n      verse thus translated by Dr. Donaldson.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general characteristics of the Venetian School, as defined by Mr.\r\nRuskin in the passage above quoted, may be traced both to historical\r\ncircumstances and to physical surroundings. Thus the first broad fact\r\nto be noticed about the Venetian School of painting is that it is\r\nlater than the Florentine by some hundred years or more. From the point\r\nof view of art, Venice, from her intimate connection as a trading\r\npower with the East, was almost a Byzantine colony. St. Mark's is a\r\nByzantine church, her earliest palaces are Byzantine palaces. And so,\r\ntoo, for painting she relied exclusively on a Byzantine supply. It was\r\nnot till the latter end of the fourteenth century that the influence\r\nof Giotto's works in the neighbouring town of Padua began to rouse\r\nVenice to do and think for herself in art, instead of letting her\r\nGreek subjects do all for her.[24] But by the time Venetian painters\r\nhad acquired any real mastery over their art, Venice was already in a\r\nstate of great magnificence; her palaces, with their fronts of white\r\nmarble, porphyry, and serpentine, were the admiration of every visitor.\r\nPainters paint what they see around them, and hence at the outset we\r\nfind in the Venetian School the rendering of material magnificence\r\nand the brilliant colours that distinguish it throughout. Look, for\r\ninstance, at the pictures by a comparatively early Venetian, like\r\nCrivelli (see 602); no other painter of a corresponding age showed such\r\nfondness for fruits and stuffs and canopies and jewels and brilliant\r\narchitecture. And then, in the second place, there is the colour of\r\nVenice itself, caused by her position on the lagoons. The Venetians\r\nhad no gardens; \"but what are the purples and scarlets and blues of\r\niris, anemone, or columbine, dispersed among deep meadow-grasses\r\nor trained in quiet cloister garden-beds, when compared with that\r\nmelodrama of flame and gold and rose and orange and azure, which the\r\nskies and lagoons of Venice yield almost daily to the eye?\" (Symonds's\r\n_Renaissance_, iii. 255). But, thirdly, the sea had a further influence\r\non Venetian painting--it caused at once their love of bodily beauty\r\nand the kind of such beauty that they loved. Compare, for instance, a\r\ntypical Venetian \"beauty,\" such as Paris Bordone's (674), with one of\r\nBotticelli's (915): how great is the difference between them! Well,\r\nthe sea \"tends to induce in us great respect for the whole human body;\r\nfor its limbs, as much as for its tongue or its wit.... To put the\r\nhelm up at the right moment is the beginning of all cunning, and for\r\nthat we need arm and eye;--not tongue. And with this respect for the\r\nbody as such, comes also the sailor's preference of massive beauty in\r\nbodily form. The landsmen, among their roses and orange-blossoms, and\r\nchequered shadows of twisted vine, may well please themselves with pale\r\nfaces, and finely drawn eyebrows and fantastic braiding of hair. But\r\nfrom the sweeping glory of the sea we learn to love another kind of\r\nbeauty; broad-breasted; level-browed, like the horizon;--thighed and\r\nshouldered like the billows;--footed like their stealing foam;--bathed\r\nin clouds of golden hair like their sunsets.\" Then further, \"this\r\nocean-work is wholly adverse to any morbid conditions of sentiment.\r\nReverie, above all things, is forbidden by Scylla and Charybdis. By\r\nthe dogs and the depths, no dreaming! The first thing required of us\r\nis presence of mind. Neither love, nor poetry, nor piety, must ever\r\nso take up our thoughts as to make us slow or unready.\" Herein will\r\nbe found the source of a notable distinction between the treatment\r\nof sacred subjects by Venetian painters and all others. The first\r\nVenetian artists began with asceticism, just as the Florentines did;\r\n\"always, however, delighting in more massive and deep colour than\r\nother religious painters. They are especially fond of saints who have\r\nbeen cardinals, because of their red hats, and they sunburn all their\r\nhermits into splendid russet brown\" (see 768). Then again, through all\r\nenthusiasm they retain a supreme common sense. Look back, for instance,\r\nfrom the religious pictures in this room, from Titian's \"Holy Family\"\r\n(635), or Cima's \"Madonna\" (634), to those of the Umbrians, which we\r\nhave just left. The Umbrian religion is something apart from the world,\r\nthe Venetian is of it. The religion of the Venetian painters is as real\r\nas that of Fra Angelico. But it was the faith not of humble men or of\r\nmystics, not of profound thinkers or ecstatic visionaries, so much\r\nas of courtiers and statesmen, of senators and merchants, for whom\r\nreligion was not a thing by itself but a part and parcel of ordinary\r\nlife. \"Throughout the rest of Italy, piety had become abstract, and\r\nopposed theoretically to worldly life; hence the Florentine and Umbrian\r\npainters generally separated their saints from living men. They\r\ndelighted in imagining scenes of spiritual perfectness;--Paradises,\r\nand companies of the redeemed at the judgment;--glorified meetings\r\nof martyrs;--madonnas surrounded by circles of angels. If, which was\r\nrare, definite portraitures of living men were introduced, these real\r\ncharacters formed a kind of chorus or attendant company, taking no part\r\nin the action. At Venice all this was reversed, and so boldly as at\r\nfirst to shock, with its seeming irreverence, a spectator accustomed to\r\nthe formalities and abstractions of the so-called sacred schools. The\r\nmadonnas are no more seated apart on their thrones, the saints no more\r\nbreathe celestial air. They are on our own plain ground--nay, here in\r\nour houses with us.\" Cima places the Madonna in his own country-side,\r\nwhilst at Venice itself Tintoret paints Paradise as the decoration\r\nfor the hall of the Greater Council of the State. The religion of the\r\nVenetian School was not less sincere than that of others, but it was\r\nless formal, less didactic; for Venice was constantly at feud with the\r\npopes, and here we come to the last circumstance which need be noticed\r\nas determining the characteristics of the school. \"Among Italian cities\r\nVenice was unique. She alone was tranquil in her empire, unimpeded in\r\nher constitutional development, independent of Church interference,\r\nundisturbed by the cross purposes and intrigues of the despots,\r\ninhabited by merchants who were princes, and by a freeborn people\r\nwho had never seen war at their gates. The serenity of undisturbed\r\nsecurity, the luxury of wealth amassed abroad and liberally spent at\r\nhome, gave a physiognomy of ease and proud self-confidence to all\r\nher edifices.... The conditions of Florence stimulated mental energy\r\nand turned the face of the soul inwards. Those of Venice inclined\r\nthe individual to accept life as he found it\" (_Symonds_, iii. 259).\r\nHence the ideal of Venetian painting was \"stateliness and power; high\r\nintercourse with kingly and beautiful humanity, proud thoughts, or\r\nsplendid pleasures; throned sensualities; and ennobled appetites.\"\r\n\r\nA speciality of the Venetian School arising from the characteristics\r\nwe have described is its portraiture. \"If there be any one sign by\r\nwhich the Venetian countenance, as it is recorded for us, to the very\r\nlife, by a school of portraiture which has never been equalled (chiefly\r\nbecause no portraiture ever had subjects so noble),--I say, if there\r\nbe one thing more notable than another in the Venetian features, it is\r\ntheir deep pensiveness and solemnity. In other districts of Italy, the\r\ndignity of the heads which occur in the most celebrated compositions is\r\nclearly owing to the feeling of the painter. He has visibly realised or\r\nidealised his models, and appears always to be veiling the faults or\r\nfailings of the human nature around him, so that the best of his work\r\nis that which has most perfectly taken the colour of his own mind; and\r\nthe least impressive, if not the least valuable, that which appears to\r\nhave been unaffected and unmodified portraiture. But at Venice, all is\r\nexactly the reverse of this. The tone of mind in the painter appears\r\noften in some degree frivolous or sensual; delighting in costume, in\r\ndomestic and grotesque incident, and in studies of the naked form. But\r\nthe moment he gives himself definitely to portraiture, all is noble\r\nand grave; the more literally true his work, the more majestic; and\r\nthe same artist who will produce little beyond what is commonplace\r\nin painting a Madonna or an Apostle, will rise into unapproachable\r\nsublimity when his subject is a Member of the Forty, or a Master of the\r\nMint\" (_Stones of Venice_, vol. iii. ch. iii. § lxxv.).\r\n\r\nIn its historical development the Venetian School may be divided, like\r\nother schools, into three main periods. First we have the _Giottesque_\r\nor heroic period, or, as it should in the case of Venice be called,\r\n\"the Vivarini epoch, bright, innocent, more or less elementary,\r\nentirely religious art, reaching from 1400-1480.\" Next comes the\r\nBellini epoch, sometimes classic and mythic as well as religious,\r\n1480-1520. In this period Venetian art is \"entirely characteristic of\r\nher calm and brave statesmanship, her modest and faithful religion.\"\r\n\"Bright costumes, distinct and sunny landscapes, broad backgrounds of\r\narchitecture, large skies, polished armour, gilded cornices, young\r\nfaces of fisher-boys and country girls, grave faces of old men brown\r\nwith sea-wind and sunlight, withered faces of women hearty in a hale\r\nold age, the strong manhood of Venetian senators, the dignity of\r\npatrician ladies, the gracefulness of children, the rosy whiteness\r\nand amber-coloured tresses of the daughters of the Adriatic and the\r\nlagoons--these are the source of inspiration to the Venetians of the\r\nsecond period.... Among the loveliest motives in the altar-pieces of\r\nthis period are the boy-angels playing flutes and mandolines beneath\r\nthe Madonna on the steps of her throne. They are more earthly than Fra\r\nAngelico's melodists, and yet they are not precisely of human lineage.\r\nIt is not, perhaps, too much to say that they strike the keynote of\r\nVenetian devotion, at once real and devoid of pietistic rapture\"\r\n(_Symonds_, iii. 266.) Thirdly comes the epoch of \"supremely powerful\r\nart corrupted by taint of death,\" 1520-1600.\r\n\r\nThis final transition may perhaps best be seen by tracing the similar\r\nprogress in the technical feature which distinguishes the Venetian\r\npainters. They are the school of colour. Their speciality consists\r\nin seeing that \"shadow is not an absence of colour, but is, on the\r\ncontrary, necessary to the full presence of colour; every colour in\r\npainting must be a shadow to some brighter colour, and a light to some\r\ndarker one--all the while being a positive colour itself. And the great\r\nsplendour of the Venetian School arises from their having seen and held\r\nfrom the beginning this great fact--that shadow is as much colour as\r\nlight, often much more. In Titian's fullest red the lights are pale\r\nrose-colour, passing into white--the shadows warm deep crimson. In\r\nVeronese's most splendid orange the lights are pale, the shadows crocus\r\ncolour.... Observe that this is no matter of taste, but fact. It is\r\nan absolute fact that shadows are as much colours as lights are; and\r\nwhoever represents them by merely the subdued or darkened tint of the\r\nlight, represents them falsely.\" But in the two earlier periods above\r\nspecified, the Venetians are further \"separated from other schools by\r\ntheir contentment with tranquil cheerfulness of light; by their never\r\nwanting to be dazzled. None of their lights are flashing or blinding;\r\nthey are soft, winning, precious; lights of pearl, not of lime: only,\r\nyou know, on this condition they cannot have sunshine: their day is\r\nthe day of Paradise; they need no candles, neither light of the sun,\r\nin their cities; and everything is seen clear, as through crystal, far\r\nor near. This holds to the end of the fifteenth century. Then they\r\nbegin to see that this, beautiful as it may be, is still a make-believe\r\nlight; that we do not live in the inside of a pearl; but in an\r\natmosphere through which a burning sun shines thwartedly, and over\r\nwhich a sorrowful night must far prevail. And then the chiaroscurists\r\nsucceed in persuading them of the fact that there is mystery in the\r\nday as in the night, and show them how constantly to see truly, is to\r\nsee dimly. And also they teach them the brilliancy of light, and the\r\ndegree in which it is raised from the darkness; and instead of their\r\nsweet and pearly peace, tempt them to look for the strength of flame\r\nand coruscation of lightning.\" Three pictures may be noted in which\r\nthe whole process may be traced. First in Bellini's \"St. Jerome\"[25]\r\n(694) is the serene light of the Master of Peace. In another Bellini\r\n(726) is a first twilight effect--such as Titian afterwards developed\r\ninto more solemn hues; whilst in No. 1130 is an example of the light\r\nfar withdrawn and the coils of shade of Tintoret. (For Ruskin's general\r\nremarks on the Venetian School see _Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix.\r\nch. iii.; _Guide to Venetian Academy_; Oxford _Lectures on Art_, §§\r\n134, 173-177.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] With the pictures of Venice, those of many neighbouring\r\ntowns--Brescia, Bergamo, Treviso, and Verona--are associated. All these\r\nlocal schools have certain peculiarities of their own, and some of them\r\nare well represented here. Nowhere, for instance, out of Brescia itself\r\ncan the Brescian School be so well studied as in the National Gallery.\r\nBut above these local peculiarities there are common characteristics in\r\nthe work of all these schools which they share with that of Venice. It\r\nis only these common characteristics that can here be noticed. (Some\r\ninteresting remarks by Dr. Richter, on the independence of the Veronese\r\nSchool, will be found in _The Art Journal_, February 1895.)\r\n\r\n[24] It should, however, be remembered that \"before the Venetian\r\nSchool of painting had got much beyond a lisp, Venetian artists were\r\nalready expressing themselves strikingly and beautifully in _stone_, in\r\narchitectural and sculptural works\" (see Morelli's _German Galleries_,\r\np. 5).\r\n\r\n[25] Now ascribed, however, to Catena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PADUAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n      \"Padovani gran dottori\" (the Paduans are great scholars)\r\n\r\n  _Italian Proverb._\r\n\r\n\r\nPadua, more than any other Italian city, was the home of the classical\r\nRenaissance in painting. It was at Padua, that is to say, that the\r\nprinciples which governed classical art were first and most distinctly\r\napplied to painting. The founder of this learned Paduan school[26]\r\nwas Squarcione (1394-1474). He had travelled in Italy and Greece, and\r\nthe school which he set up in Padua on his return--filled with models\r\nand casts from the antique--enjoyed in its day such a reputation\r\nthat travelling princes and great lords used to honour it with their\r\nvisits. It was the influence of ancient sculpture that gave the Paduan\r\nSchool its characteristics. Squarcione was pre-eminently a teacher of\r\nthe learned science of linear perspective; and the study of antique\r\nsculpture led his pupils to define all their forms severely and\r\nsharply. \"In truth,\" says Layard, \"the peculiarity of this school\r\nconsists in a style of conception and treatment more plastic than\r\npictorial.\" This characteristic of the school is pointed out below\r\nunder some of Mantegna's pictures, but is seen best of all in Gregorio\r\nSchiavone (see especially 630). A second mark of the classical learning\r\nof the school may be observed in the choice of antique embellishments,\r\nof bas-reliefs and festoons of fruits in the accessories. For a third\r\nand crowning characteristic of the school--the repose and self-control\r\nof classical art--the reader is referred to the remarks under\r\nMantegna's pictures. With Mantegna the school of Padua reached its\r\nconsummation. Crivelli's pictures are hung with those of the Paduan\r\nschool, for he too is believed to have been a pupil of Squarcione.\r\nBut after Mantegna the learning of Padua must be traced not in native\r\npainters, but in its influence on other schools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] The earlier Paduan School, represented in the National Gallery by\r\nNo 701, was only an offshoot from the Florentine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATER ITALIAN SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n      \"The eclectic school endeavoured to unite opposite partialities\r\n      and weaknesses. They trained themselves under masters of\r\n      exaggeration, and tried to unite opposite exaggerations.\r\n      That was impossible. They did not see that the only possible\r\n      eclecticism had been already accomplished;--the eclecticism\r\n      of temperance, which, by the restraint of force, gains higher\r\n      force; and by the self-denial of delight, gains higher delight\"\r\n      (RUSKIN: _Two Paths_, § 59).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe typical painters, with whom this chapter is concerned, are those\r\nof the \"Eclectic School\" of Bologna--the Carracci, Domenichino, Guido\r\nReni; and Salvator Rosa, the Neapolitan painter of about the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt may be noticed, in the first place, that the lower repute in which\r\nthese Italian painters of the seventeenth century are now held is of\r\ncomparatively recent date. Poussin, for instance, ranked Domenichino\r\nnext to Raphael, and preferred the works of the Carracci to all others\r\nin Rome, except only Raphael's, and Sir Joshua Reynolds cited them as\r\nmodels of perfection. Why, then, is it that modern criticism stamps\r\nthe later Italian Schools as schools of the decadence? To examine\r\nthe pictures themselves and to compare them with earlier works is\r\nthe best way of finding out; but a few general remarks may be found\r\nof assistance. The painting of the schools now under consideration\r\nwas \"not spontaneous art. It was art mechanically revived during\r\na period of critical hesitancy and declining enthusiasms.\" It was\r\nlargely produced at Bologna by men not eminently gifted for the\r\narts. When Ludovico Carracci, for instance, went to Venice, the\r\nveteran Tintoretto warned him that he had no vocation. Moreover \"the\r\npainting which emerged there at the close of the sixteenth century\r\nembodied religion and culture, both of a base alloy.... Therefore,\r\nthough the painters went on painting the old subjects, they painted\r\nall alike with frigid superficiality. Nothing new or vital, fanciful\r\nor imaginative, has been breathed into antique mythology. What has\r\nbeen added to religious expression is repellent, ... extravagantly\r\nideal in ecstatic Magdalens and Maries, extravagantly realistic in\r\nmartyrdoms and torments, extravagantly harsh in dogmatic mysteries,\r\nextravagantly soft in sentimental tenderness and tearful piety.... If\r\nwe turn from the ideas of the late Italian painters to their execution,\r\nwe shall find similar reasons for its failure to delight\" (Symonds's\r\n_Renaissance_, vii. 232). For \"all these old eclectic theories were\r\nbased not upon an endeavour to unite the various characters of nature\r\n(which it is possible to do), but the various narrownesses of taste,\r\nwhich it is impossible to do.... All these specialities have their\r\nown charm in their own way; and there are times when the particular\r\nhumour of each man is refreshing to us from its very distinctness;\r\nbut the effort to add any other qualities to this refreshing one\r\ninstantly takes away the distinctiveness\" (_Two Paths_, § 58). It was\r\nnot an attempt to unite the various characters of _nature_. On the\r\ncontrary, \"these painters, in selecting, omitted just those features\r\nwhich had given grace and character to their models. The substitution\r\nof generic types for portraiture, the avoidance of individuality, the\r\ncontempt for what is simple and natural in details, deprived their work\r\nof attractiveness and suggestion. It is noticeable that they never\r\npainted flowers. While studying Titian's landscapes, they omitted the\r\niris and the caper-blossom and the columbine, which star the grass\r\nbeneath Ariadne's feet.... They began the false system of depicting\r\nideal foliage and ideal precipices--that is to say, trees which are not\r\ntrees, and cliffs which cannot be distinguished from cork or stucco.\r\nIn like manner, the cloths wherewith they clad their personages were\r\nnot of brocade, or satin, or broadcloth, but of that empty lie called\r\ndrapery ... one monstrous nondescript stuff, differently dyed in dull\r\nor glaring colours, but always shoddy. Characteristic costumes have\r\ndisappeared.... After the same fashion furniture, utensils, houses,\r\nanimals, birds, weapons, are idealised--stripped, that is to say, of\r\nwhat in these things is specific and vital\"[27] (Symonds, _ibid._ p.\r\n233).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the historical development of the declining art whose\r\ngeneral characteristics we have been discussing, it is usual to group\r\nthe painters under three heads--the Mannerists, the Eclectics, and\r\nthe Naturalists. By the first of these are meant the painters in the\r\nseveral schools who succeeded the culminating masters and imitated\r\ntheir peculiarities. We have already noticed, under the Florentine\r\nSchool, how this \"mannerism\" set in, and all the other schools show a\r\nlike process. Thus Giulio Romano shows the dramatic energy of Raphael\r\nand Michael Angelo passed into mannerism. Tiepolo is a \"mannerised\"\r\nPaolo Veronese, Baroccio a \"mannerised\" Correggio. Later on, however,\r\nand largely under the influence of the \"counter-Reformation\"--the\r\nrenewed activity, that is, of the Roman church consequent on the\r\nReformation,[28]--a reaction against the Mannerists set in. This\r\nreaction took two forms. The first was that of the Eclectic School\r\nfounded by the Carraccis at Bologna in about the year 1580. This\r\nschool--so called from its principle of \"selecting\" the qualities of\r\ndifferent schools--includes, besides the Carraccis themselves, Guido\r\nReni, Domenichino, Sassoferrato, and Guercino. The last-mentioned,\r\nhowever, combined in some measure the aims both of the Eclectics and of\r\nthe other school which was formed in protest against the Mannerists.\r\nThis was the school of the so-called Naturalists, of whom Caravaggio\r\n(1569-1609) was the first representative, and whose influence may be\r\ntraced in the Spanish Ribera (see page 220) and the Neapolitan Salvator\r\nRosa. They called themselves \"Naturalists,\" as being opposed to the\r\n\"ideal\" aims alike of the Mannerists and the Eclectics; but they made\r\nthe fatal mistake--a mistake which seems to have a permanent hold on a\r\ncertain order of minds, for it is at the root of much of the art-effort\r\nof our own day--that there is something more \"real\" and \"natural\"\r\nin the vulgarities of human life than in its nobleness, and in the\r\nugliness of nature than in its beauty (see below under 172, and under\r\nSalvator Rosa _passim_).\r\n\r\nThe later Venetian pictures make a most interesting group. In the\r\neighteenth century Venetian art experienced a partial revival, and the\r\npainters of this revival--Tiepolo, Longhi, Canaletto, and Guardi may\r\nhere be well studied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] It was this false striving after \"the ideal,\" as Mr. Symonds\r\npoints out, that caused Reynolds, with his obsolete doctrine about\r\nthe nature of \"the grand style,\" to admire the Bolognese masters. For\r\nReynolds's statement of his doctrine see his _Discourses_, ii. and\r\niii., and his papers in the _Idler_ (Nos. 79 and 82); for Ruskin's\r\ndestructive criticism of it, see _Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv.\r\nch. i.-iii.\r\n\r\n[28] The realism and the morbid taint in the religious pictures of\r\nthe Italian decadence were in some measure the direct outcome of\r\necclesiastical teaching. \"Depict well the flaying of St. Bartholomew,\"\r\nsaid a Jesuit father, \"it may win hearts to piety.\" The comment of\r\nShelley on the Bolognese Schools was this: \"Why write books against\r\nreligion when we may hang up such pictures?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY FLEMISH AND THE GERMAN SCHOOLS\r\n\r\n      \"Why is it, probably, that Pictures exist in the world, and\r\n      to what end was the divine art of Painting bestowed, by the\r\n      earnest gods, upon poor mankind? I could advise once, for a\r\n      little! To make this poor authentic earth a little memorable\r\n      for us. Flaying of St. Bartholomew, Rape of Europa, Rape of the\r\n      Sabines, Piping and Amours of goat-footed Pan, Romulus suckled\r\n      by the Wolf: all this and much else of fabulous, distant,\r\n      unimportant, not to say impossible, ugly and unworthy shall\r\n      pass. But I say, Herewithal is something not phantasmal; of\r\n      indisputable certainty, home-grown\" (CARLYLE: _Friedrich_, bk.\r\n      iv. ch. vi., slightly altered).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Early Flemish and German schools are by no means so completely\r\nrepresented as the nearly contemporary schools of Italy; but there\r\nare enough pictures to bring out the characteristics of the northern\r\nart. Nothing can be more instructive, and convincing of the value of\r\nart as a means of national autobiography, than to compare the early\r\npictures in these rooms _en bloc_ with those in any of the Italian\r\nrooms (_e.g._ the Umbrian). No one can fail to be struck at once by\r\nthe contrast between what Mr. Ruskin has called \"the angular and bony\r\nsanctities of the North,\" and \"the drooping graces and pensive pieties\r\nof the South.\" This is the first distinguishing character of the early\r\nnorthern art: there is little feeling, or care, for beauty as such.\r\nLook round the rooms, and see whether there is a single face which\r\nwill haunt you for its beauty. Look at the pictures which interest\r\nyou most, choose out the brightest and the most exquisitely finished:\r\nand see if it is not an almost defiant absence of beautiful feature\r\nthat characterises them. Coupled with their absence of feeling for the\r\nbeautiful there is in the work of these artists a strange fondness for\r\ndeath--for agonies, crucifixions, depositions, exhumations. \"It is not\r\nthat the person needs excitement or has any such strong perceptions as\r\nwould cause excitement, but he is dead to the horror, and a strange\r\nevil influence guides his feebleness of mind rather to fearful images\r\nthan to beautiful ones,--as our disturbed dreams are sometimes filled\r\nwith ghastlinesses which seem not to arise out of any conceivable\r\nassociation of our waking ideas, but to be a vapour out of the very\r\nchambers of the tomb, to which the mind, in its palsy, has approached\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. iv. pt. v. ch. xix. § 16). Thus, in painting\r\nscenes from the Passion or stories from the book of martyrs, the\r\nItalians of the earlier time endured the painfulness, the northern\r\nartists rejoiced in it.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is it that gives these pictures their worth and has\r\ncaused their painters to be included amongst the great masters of\r\nthe world? Look at some of the best, and the more you look the more\r\nyou will see that their goodness consists in an absolute fidelity to\r\nnature--in dress, in ornaments, and especially in portraiture. Here\r\nare unmistakably the men and women of the time, set down precisely\r\nin their habit as they lived. In this grim, unrelenting truthfulness\r\nthese pictures correspond exactly to the ideal which Carlyle--himself\r\na typical northerner--lays down, in the passage above quoted, for the\r\nart of painting.\r\n\r\nLook at these pictures and at the Italian again, and another obvious\r\ndifference is apparent. The Flemish pictures are on the whole much\r\nsmaller. This is a fact full of significance. In the sunny South the\r\nartists spent their best energies in covering large spaces of wall with\r\nfrescoes; in the damp climate of the North they were obliged to paint\r\nchiefly upon panels. The conditions of their climate were no doubt what\r\nled to the discovery of the Van Eyck method (described under 186),\r\nthe point of which was a way of drying pictures rapidly without the\r\nnecessity of exposure to the sun. It was a method only applicable to\r\nwork on a small scale, but it permitted such work to be brought to the\r\nhighest finish. This precisely suited the painstaking, patient men of\r\nthe Low Countries. Hence the minuteness and finish which characterise\r\ntheir work. Moreover, \"every charm that can be bestowed upon so small\r\na surface is requisite to intensify its attractive power; and hence\r\nFlemish painters developed a jewel-like quality of colouring which\r\nremained peculiar to themselves.\" ... Further, the Van Eyck method,\r\nrequiring absolute forethought and forbidding any alterations, tended\r\nto a set of stock subjects treated more or less in the same way. \"Thus\r\nthe chief qualities of the Flemish School may be called Veracity\r\nof Imitation, Jewel-like richness of Colour, perfection of Finish,\r\nemphasis of Character, and Conservatism in design. These indeed are\r\nvirtues enough to make a school of art great in the annals of time,\r\neven though they may never be able to win for it the clatter of popular\r\napplause. The paintings of Flanders were not, and were not intended to\r\nbe, popular. Flemish artists did not, like the Italians, paint for the\r\nfolk, but for the delight of a small cultured clique.\"[29]\r\n\r\nSuch are the general characteristics of the Early Flemish School.\r\nPassing now to its historical development and to its relations with the\r\nschools of Germany, we may distinguish three successive periods. (1)\r\nThe birthplace of painting as a separate art in the North was on the\r\nLower Rhine, at Maastricht and Cologne. Of this school of the Lower\r\nRhine a characteristic specimen is No. 687. It is properly grouped with\r\nthe Early Flemish School, because in the fourteenth century most of the\r\nFlemish artists were Germans from the valley of the Rhine. (2) Later\r\non, however, the great development in the prosperity and wealth of the\r\nLow Countries--the land of the Woolsack and the Golden Fleece, led to\r\nthe growth of a native art. This was closely connected with the schools\r\nof illuminators patronised by the Courts of France and Burgundy,\r\nand many works of the _Primitifs_ cannot be distinguished, with any\r\ncomplete certainty, as French or Flemish. Just as at Venice the people,\r\nbusy with their trade, preferred for a long time to buy rather than\r\nproduce their works of art, but afterwards settled down and made works\r\nfor themselves, so in Flanders the German art came to be superseded by\r\na native Flemish art. The Early Flemish School, covering roughly the\r\nperiod 1400-1500, was the result, the most important masters being Van\r\nEyck, Van der Weyden, Bouts, David, and Memlinc. (3.) It was now the\r\nturn of this school to influence that of Germany. The Flemish masters\r\nwere great travellers, and the German masters were no doubt attracted\r\nto Flanders by the great technical skill there in vogue. Hence we\r\nnow come to a second period in German painting--marked by Flemish\r\ninfluence. There is less of the mysticism and more realism; but with\r\nthe realism there is an element of brutality and ugliness. Nos. 707 and\r\n1049 are typical German pictures of this period.\r\n\r\nFinally, it will be noticed, as the visitor goes round the rooms, that\r\nmany of the pictures are either altogether \"unknown\" or are attributed\r\nto artists whose names are not given, and who are merely described as\r\nthe \"master\" of such and such other pictures. This is an interesting\r\nand characteristic point. Of individual painters of the Early German\r\nSchool, and for the most part of those of the Early Flemish, very\r\nlittle is known. They seldom signed their names,[30] and the works\r\nof the fifteenth century were in the next two centuries treated with\r\nneglect. Hence both the attribution of these pictures, and the lives of\r\nthe painters to whom they are attributed, are still very uncertain. A\r\nsecond reason for this uncertainty is to be found in the Guild system,\r\nwhich was very strict amongst the northern artists. Painting, to the\r\nmediæval mind, was a craft like any other, and was subject to the same\r\nrules. The Guild educated the artist and bought his materials, and\r\neven when he emerged into mastership, stood in many ways between him\r\nand his patron. Hence pictures were often regarded as the work not\r\nof this or that individual, but of this or that Guild. Hence too the\r\nquiet industry and the uncompetitive patience of these Early Flemish\r\npainters. \"It was not merely the result of chance that the brothers\r\nVan Eyck invented their peculiar method of painting by which they were\r\nenabled to produce pictures of almost unlimited durability and of\r\nunsurpassable finish, provided sufficient care were bestowed upon the\r\nwork. The spirit of the day and the method of the day were reflections\r\none of another.... Take any picture of this old Flemish School, and\r\nregard it carefully, you will find that only so do its beauties strike\r\nyou at all.... The old Flemish artists did always the thing that was\r\nwithin their powers, striving indeed by daily industry to increase the\r\nstrength of those powers, but never hoping either by luck or momentary\r\ninsanity to attain anything unattainable by patient thought and\r\nlong-continued labour. 'Patient continuance in well-doing' was the open\r\nsecret of their success\" (_Conway_, ch. ii.)\r\n\r\nOf the later German School, specially distinguished in portraiture,\r\nthe Gallery has now some fine examples, and here again there is\r\nsimilarity between the German and the early Flemish painters. \"If,\"\r\nsays Ruskin, \"the reader were to make the circuit of this collection\r\nfor the purpose of determining which picture united in its modes of\r\nexecution the highest reach of achievement with the strongest assurance\r\nof durability, we believe that he would finally pause before a small\r\npicture or panel, representing two quaintly dressed figures in a dimly\r\nlighted room.\" Turn from the portraits by Jan van Eyck to the portraits\r\nby Cranach and Albert Dürer, and much of the same minute fidelity and\r\ncareful workmanship will be found. For Holbein's portraits, the reader\r\nis referred to the notes (pp. 613-4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Sir W. M.

They are now separated, and with the _early_ Flemish\r\nschool we have already dealt. We take up the story here at the point\r\nwhere it leaves off there, and proceed to discuss the Dutch school;\r\npassing afterwards to the later Flemish school. The confusion between\r\nDutch and Flemish art is, it may first be remarked, historical. Just as\r\nFlanders derived its earliest artistic impulse from German painters, so\r\ndid the Dutch derive theirs from the Flemings. In the two first periods\r\nof Flemish art, Dutch art runs precisely parallel with it. During the\r\nsixteenth century a new development began in both schools. This is the\r\nperiod of Italian influence, of the \"Romanists\" or \"Italianisers,\" as\r\nthey are called, represented typically by Bernard van Orley and Mabuse.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the sixteenth century, however, a national movement\r\nbegan in both schools--corresponding closely to political changes. In\r\n1579 the \"Union of Utrecht\" was effected, whereby the Dutch \"United\r\nProvinces\" (= roughly what is now Holland) were separated alike from\r\nthe Spanish Netherlands and from the Empire, and Dutch independence\r\nthus began. Within the next fifty years nearly all the great Dutch\r\npainters were born--Berchem, Bol, Cuyp, Frans Hals, Van der Helst,\r\nDe Keyser, Rembrandt, Ruysdael. In characteristics, as well as in\r\nchronology, Dutch art was the direct outcome of Dutch history. This\r\nart has come to be identified in common parlance, owing to its chief\r\nand distinguishing characteristic, with what is known as \"_genre_\r\npainting,\"--the painting, that is, which takes its subject from small\r\nincidents of everyday life. Three historical conditions combined to\r\nbring this kind of painting into vogue. First, the Reformation. The\r\nDutch, when they asserted their independence, were no longer Catholics;\r\nbut Protestantism despised the arts, and hence the arts became entirely\r\ndissociated from religion. There were no more churches to ornament,\r\nand hence no more religious pictures were painted[31] whilst religious\r\nrapture is superseded by what one of their own critics describes as\r\n\"the boisterous outbursts which betoken approaching drunkenness\"\r\n(Havard: _The Dutch School_, p. 12).[32] Secondly, the Dutch were\r\nRepublicans. There was no reigning family. There were no palaces to\r\ndecorate, and hence no more historical or mythological pictures were\r\nin demand. This point of distinction may best be remembered by the\r\nsupreme contempt which the great King Louis XIV. of France entertained\r\nfor the _genre_ style. _Eloignez de mot ces magots_, he said, \"take\r\naway the absurd things,\" when some one showed him some works by\r\nTeniers. But the \"plain, simple citizens\" of the United Provinces\r\ndid not want their faces idealised--hence the prosaic excellence of\r\nDutch portraiture,--nor had they any ambition to see on their walls\r\nanything but an imitation of their actual lives--of their dykes,\r\ntheir courtyards, their kitchens, and their sculleries. Thirdly,\r\nthe Dutch were a very self-centred people. \"With the Dutch,\" says\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds (Discourse iv.), \"a history piece is properly a\r\nportrait of themselves; whether they describe the inside or outside\r\nof their houses, we have their own people engaged in their own\r\npeculiar occupations; working or drinking, playing or fighting. The\r\ncircumstances that enter into a picture of this kind, are so far from\r\ngiving a general view of human life, that they exhibit all the minute\r\nparticularities of a nation differing in several respects from the rest\r\nof mankind.\" \"Those innumerable _genre_ pieces--conversation, music,\r\nplay--were in truth,\" says Mr. Pater, \"the equivalent of novel-reading\r\nfor that day; its own actual life, in its own proper circumstances,\r\nreflected in various degrees of idealisation, with no diminution of the\r\nsense of reality (that is to say), but with more and more purged and\r\nperfected delightfulness of interest. Themselves illustrating, as every\r\nstudent of their history knows, the good-fellowship of family life, it\r\nwas the ideal of that life which these artists depicted; the ideal of\r\nhome in a country where the preponderant interest of life, after all,\r\ncould not well be out of doors. Of the earth earthy,[33] it was an\r\nideal very different from that which the sacred Italian painters had\r\nevoked from the life of Italy; yet, in its best types, was not without\r\na kind of natural religiousness. And in the achievement of a type of\r\nbeauty so national and vernacular, the votaries of purely Italian art\r\nmight well feel that the Italianisers, like Berghem, Bol, and Jan\r\nWeenix, went so far afield in vain\" (_Imaginary Portraits_, p. 99).\r\n\r\nThe same awakening of a national taste made itself felt in the native\r\nschool of Dutch landscape--a landscape excellent in many ways, but\r\ncabin'd, cribbed, and confined, like their own dykes. \"Of deities or\r\nvirtues, angels, principalities, or powers, in the name of our ditches,\r\nno more. Let us have cattle, and market vegetables\" (_Modern Painters_,\r\nvol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. § 11). But the Dutch School of landscape\r\nhad the qualities of its defects. \"The Dutch began to see what a\r\npicture their country was--its canals, and _boompjis_, and endless\r\nbroadly-lighted meadows, and thousands of miles of quaint water-side;\r\nand their painters were the first true masters of landscape for its own\r\nsake\" (Pater, _ib._ p. 98).\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] This statement, like all others in so short and general a summary\r\nas alone can be here attempted, is of course only broadly true.\r\n\r\n[32] It is interesting to note that this spirit of anti-religious\r\nrevolt is what fascinated Heine in Dutch pictures. \"In the house I\r\nlodged at in Leyden there once lived,\" he says, \"the great Jan Steen,\r\nwhom I hold to be as great as Raphael. Even as a sacred painter Jan was\r\nas great, and that will be clearly seen when the religion of sorrow\r\nhas passed away.... How often, during my stay, did I think myself back\r\nfor whole hours into the household scenes in which the excellent Jan\r\nmust have lived and suffered. Many a time I thought I saw him bodily,\r\nsitting at his easel, now and then grasping the great jug, 'reflecting\r\nand therewith drinking, and then again drinking without reflecting.' It\r\nwas no gloomy Catholic spectre that I saw, but a modern bright spirit\r\nof joy, who after death still visited his old workroom to paint many\r\npictures and to drink\" (Heine's _Prose Writings_, Camelot Series, p.\r\n67).\r\n\r\n[33] \"The Dutch painters were not poets, nor the sons of poets, but\r\ntheir fathers rescued a Republic from the slime and covered it with\r\nsuch fair farms that I declare to this day I like Dutch cheese as\r\nwell as any, because it sends one in imagination to the many-uddered\r\nmeadows which Cuyp has embossed in gold and silver. What savoury\r\nhares and rabbits they had in the low blunt sand-hills, and how the\r\nTeniers boor snared them, and how the big-breech'd Gunn-Mann (I haven't\r\nany knowledge of Dutch, but I am sure that must be the Dutch for\r\n'sportsman') banged off his piece at them, and then how the shining\r\nVrow saw them in the Schopp and bargained for them. The Schopp had\r\noften a window with a green curtain in it, and a basso-relievo of\r\nCupids and goats beneath, with a crack across the bas-relief, and iron\r\nstains on the marble, and a bright brass bulging bottle on the sill,\r\nand such pickling cabbage as makes the mouth water\" (_Letters of James\r\nSmetham_, p. 172).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LATER FLEMISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Flemish school has been already traced (pp.\r\n38-41). The birth of its later period is almost exactly contemporaneous\r\nwith that which has been described in the case of the Dutch school.\r\nIn 1598 the Archduke Albert and his consort Isabel established what\r\nwas almost an independent State in the Spanish Netherlands (= roughly\r\nFlanders, or the modern Belgium). The \"Spanish Fury\" was at an end, the\r\nInquisition was relaxed. Albert and Isabel eagerly welcomed artists\r\nand men of letters, and the exuberant art of Rubens responded to the\r\ncall. This is the third and great period in the Flemish school--the\r\nsuccession being carried on by Rubens's pupils, Van Dyck and Teniers.\r\nRubens, the greatest master of the Flemish School, was born in 1577\r\nin Germany, but brought up at Antwerp, then the depository of western\r\ncommerce, and he coloured every subject that he touched with the same\r\nhues of gay magnificence. It is by his pictures, and those of Van\r\nDyck, that this room is dominated, and it is unnecessary to anticipate\r\nhere the accounts of those masters given below (pp. 111, 130). They\r\nwere painters of the Courts. The works of Teniers complete the picture\r\nof Flemish life and manners by taking us among the common people in\r\ncountry fairs and village taverns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n      \"For the learned and the lettered,\" says a Spanish author in\r\n      the reign of Philip IV., \"written knowledge may suffice; but\r\n      for the ignorant, what master is like Painting? They may read\r\n      their duty in a picture, although they cannot search for it in\r\n      books.\"\r\n\r\n      \"What we are all attempting,\" said Sir Joshua Reynolds, \"to do\r\n      with great labour, Velazquez does at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of the great schools of painting is so scantily represented in the\r\nNational Gallery as the Spanish, although the works in this room by its\r\ngreatest master, Velazquez, are of exceptional excellence in quality\r\nand of exceptional interest as illustrating the progress of his art.\r\nThe deficiency in Spanish pictures is not peculiar to London. \"Spain,\"\r\nsaid Sir David Wilkie, \"is the Timbuctoo of artists.\" The Spanish\r\nSchool of painters and their history are still only half explored, and\r\ncan only be fully studied in Spain itself. \"He who Seville (and Madrid)\r\nhas not seen, has not seen the marvels great\" of Spanish painting.[34]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, enough examples of the school here to make some few\r\ngeneral remarks desirable. The first point to be noticed is this, that\r\nall the painters represented in the room (with two or three exceptions)\r\nare nearly contemporary. The period 1588-1682 covers all their lives.\r\n\r\nThey are four of the chief painters of Spain, and they all reach\r\na high level of technical skill. This fact suggests at once the\r\nfirst characteristic point in the history of the Spanish School. It\r\nhas no infancy.[35] It sprang full-grown into birth. The reason of\r\nthis was its Italian origin. The art of painting, except as purely\r\ndecorative, was forbidden to the Moors; and it was only in 1492,\r\nwhen the banner of Castile first hung on the towers of the Alhambra,\r\nthat the age of painting, as of other greatness, began for Spain.\r\nBut the very greatness of Spain led to Italian influence in art.\r\nThe early Spanish painters nearly all found means of going to Italy\r\n(Theotocopuli,--1122--was born there in 1548), and the great Italian\r\npainters were constantly attracted to the Spanish court.\r\n\r\nBut though Spanish art sprang thus rapidly to perfection under foreign\r\ninfluence, it was yet stamped throughout with a thoroughly distinctive\r\ncharacter. In the first place the proverbial gravity of the Spaniard\r\nis reflected also in his art. Look round this room, and see if the\r\nprevailing impression is not of something grave, dark, lurid. There\r\nis here nothing of the sweet fancifulness of the early Florentines,\r\nnothing of the gay voluptuousness of the later Venetians. The shadow of\r\nthe Spaniard's dark cloak seems to be over every canvas. Then secondly,\r\nSpanish painting is intensely \"naturalist.\" Velazquez exhibits this\r\ntendency at its best: there is an irresistible reality about his\r\nportraits which makes the men alive to all who look at them; Murillo\r\nexhibits it in its excess: his best religious pictures are spoiled by\r\ntheir too close adherence to ordinary and even vulgar types.\r\n\r\nBoth these characteristics are partly accounted for by a third.\r\nPainting in Spain was not so much the handmaid, as the bondslave, of\r\nthe Church. As the Church was in Spain, so had art to be--monastic,\r\nsevere, immutable. \"To have changed an attitude or an attribute would\r\nhave been a change of Deity.\" Pacheco, the master of Velazquez, was\r\ncharged by the Inquisition to see that no pictures were painted likely\r\nto disturb the true faith. Angels were on no account, he prescribed,\r\nto be drawn without wings. The feet of the Blessed Virgin were on no\r\naccount to be exhibited, and she was to be dressed in blue and white,\r\nfor that she was so dressed when she appeared to Beatrix de Silva,\r\na Portuguese nun, who founded the order called after her. One sees\r\nat once how an art, working under such conditions as these, would be\r\nlikely to lose free play of fancy. And then, lastly, one may note\r\nhow the Spanish church tended also to make Spanish art intensely\r\nnaturalistic. Pictures were expected to teach religious dogmas and to\r\nenforce mystical ideas. But, in the inevitable course of superstition,\r\nthe symbol passed into a reality. This was more particularly the case\r\nwith statues. Everything was done to get images accepted as realities.\r\nTo this day they are not only painted but dressed: they have, like\r\nqueens, their mistress of the robes. This idea of art--as something\r\nwhich was not to appeal to the imagination, but was to pass itself off\r\nas a reality--inevitably extended also to Spanish painting. How far it\r\ndid so is best shown in a story gravely related by Pacheco. A painter\r\non a high scaffold had just half finished the figure of the Blessed\r\nVirgin when he felt the whole woodwork on which he stood giving way.\r\nHe called out in his horror, \"Holy Virgin, hold me,\" and straightway\r\nthe painted arm of the Virgin was thrust out from the wall, supporting\r\nthe painter in mid-air! When a ladder was brought and the painter got\r\nhis feet on it, the Virgin's arm relapsed and became again only a\r\npainting on the wall. One need not go farther than this story to see\r\nthe origin of the realistic character of Spanish art, or to understand\r\nhow Murillo, although often the most mystic of all painters in his\r\nconceptions of religious subjects, was also the most naturalistic in\r\nhis treatment of them (see W. B. Scott: _Murillo and the Spanish School\r\nof Painting_).\r\n\r\n      --> _We now pass into Rooms XVI. and XVII., where pictures of\r\n      the French School are hung._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] On the ground floor small copies of many of the famous pictures at\r\nMadrid may be seen.\r\n\r\n[35] This statement, though broadly true, requires, of course, much\r\nmodification: see the early Spanish picture (of the 15th century) on\r\nloan in this room from the Victoria and Albert Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH SCHOOL\r\n\r\n_ROOMS XVI AND XVII_\r\n\r\n    Whate'er Lorraine _light-touch'd_ with _softening_ hue,\r\n    Or _savage_ Rosa _dash'd_, or _learned_ Poussin _drew_.\r\n\r\n  THOMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the pictures in this room nearly all the more important are the\r\nworks of three masters--Claude and the two Poussins. It is of them,\r\ntherefore, that a few general remarks will here be made. It should be\r\nnoticed in the first place how very different this French School of\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is from the French School of\r\nto-day. The latter school is distinguished for its technical skill,\r\nwhich makes Paris the chief centre of art teaching in the world, but,\r\nalso, and still more markedly, for its \"excessive realism and gross\r\nsensuality.\" \"A few years ago,\" adds Professor Middleton, \"a gold\r\nmedal was won at the Paris _Salon_ by a 'naturalist' picture--a real\r\nmasterpiece of technical skill. It represented Job as an emaciated old\r\nman covered with ulcers, carefully studied in the Paris hospitals for\r\nskin diseases.\" There could not be a greater contrast than between such\r\nart as that and the \"ideal\" landscapes of Claude, the Bacchanalian\r\nscenes of Poussin, or the soft girl-faces of Greuze.\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves now to Claude and the Poussins--with whom, however,\r\nthe contemporary works of Salvator Rosa (in Room XIII.) should be\r\nstudied, we note that in spite of considerable differences between\r\nthem they agree in marking a great advance in the art of landscape\r\npainting. The old conventionalism has now altogether disappeared; there\r\nis an attempt to paint nature as she really is. There are effects of\r\nnature, too,--not shown in any earlier pictures, and here painted for\r\nthe first time,--graceful effects of foliage, smooth surface of water,\r\ndiffusion of yellow sunlight. In some of these effects Claude has\r\nnever been surpassed; but when his pictures are more closely examined,\r\nthey are often found to be untrue to the forms of nature. Trees are\r\nnot branched, nor rocks formed, nor mountains grouped as Claude and\r\nPoussin represent. Their conception of landscape, and especially of\r\nits relation to human life, is governed by the \"classical ideal,\"\r\nto which as far as possible they made their pictures approach. This\r\n\"classical\" landscape is \"the representation of (1) perfectly trained\r\nand civilised human life; (2) associated with perfect natural scenery,\r\nand (3) with decorative spiritual powers. (1) There are no signs in\r\nit of humiliating labour or abasing misfortune. Classical persons\r\nmust be trained in all the polite arts, and, because their health is\r\nto be perfect, chiefly in the open air. Hence the architecture around\r\nthem must be of the most finished kind, the rough country and ground\r\nbeing subdued by frequent and happy humanity. (2) Such personages\r\nand buildings must be associated with natural scenery, uninjured by\r\nstorms or inclemency of climate (such injury implying interruption\r\nof the open air life); and it must be scenery conducing to pleasure,\r\nnot to material service; all cornfields, orchards, olive-yards, and\r\nsuch-like being under the management of slaves, and the superior\r\nbeings having nothing to do with them; but passing their lives under\r\navenues of scented and otherwise delightful trees--under picturesque\r\nrocks and by clear fountains. It is curious, as marking the classical\r\nspirit, that a sailing vessel is hardly admissible, but a galley\r\nwith oars is admissible, because the rowers may be conceived as\r\nabsolute slaves. (3) The spiritual powers in classical scenery must\r\nbe decorative; ornamental gods, not governing gods; otherwise they\r\ncould not be subjected to the principles of taste, but would demand\r\nreverence. In order, therefore, as far as possible, without taking\r\naway their supernatural power, to destroy their dignity ... those only\r\nare introduced who are the lords of lascivious pleasures. For the\r\nappearance of any great god would at once destroy the whole theory of\r\nclassical life; therefore Pan, Bacchus, and the Satyrs, with Venus\r\nand the Nymphs, are the principal spiritual powers of the classical\r\nlandscape\" (abridged from _Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. v. §§\r\n1-8).\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to point out how entirely this ideal accords with\r\nthe prevailing taste and literature of their time. The painting of\r\nClaude and Salvator precisely corresponds to what is called \"_pastoral_\r\npoetry, that is to say, poetry written in praise of the country, by\r\nmen who lived in coffee-houses and on the Mall[36]-- ... the class\r\nof poetry in which a farmer's girl is spoken of as a 'nymph,' and a\r\nfarmer's boy as a 'swain,' and in which, throughout, a ridiculous\r\nand unnatural refinement is supposed to exist in rural life, merely\r\nbecause the poet himself has neither had the courage to endure its\r\nhardships, nor the wit to conceive its realities.... Examine the\r\nnovels of Smollett, Fielding, and Sterne, the comedies of Molière,\r\nand the writings of Johnson and Addison, and I do not think you will\r\nfind a single expression of true delight in sublime nature in any one\r\nof them. Perhaps Sterne's _Sentimental Journey_, in its total absence\r\nof sentiment on any subject but humanity ... is the most striking\r\ninstance; ... and if you compare with this negation of feeling on one\r\nside, the interludes of Molière, in which shepherds and shepherdesses\r\nare introduced in court dress, you will have a very accurate conception\r\nof the general spirit of the age.[37] It was in such a state of\r\nsociety that the landscape of Claude, Gaspar Poussin, and Salvator Rosa\r\nattained its reputation. It is the complete expression on canvas of the\r\nspirit of the time\" (Edinburgh _Lectures on Architecture and Painting_,\r\npp. 163-167). The reputation thus gained survived unimpaired almost\r\ninto the present century, until Wordsworth in poetry and Turner in\r\npainting led the return to nature, and the modern school of landscape\r\narose.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the art of Constable to which direct influence\r\nmust be attributed in the foundation of the modern school of\r\nlandscape--_paysage intime_--in France (see Vol. II., pp. 93-4). Of\r\nthis school, wholly unrepresented until lately in our National Gallery,\r\na few examples--characteristic, if not very important--may now be seen\r\nin Room XVII. (see Nos. 2058, 2135, etc.).\r\n\r\n--> _We have now concluded our survey of the Foreign Schools. The\r\nwestern doors in Room XVII. lead down a side staircase into the\r\nentrance Hall, and thus form an exit from the Gallery. On the\r\nstaircases leading to the Hall and thence down to the basement, some\r\nforeign pictures are now placed. The visitor who wishes to see the\r\nBritish School should return into Room XVI. and thence proceed into\r\nthe East Vestibule, where a few portraits by British masters are hung.\r\nDescending the steps and ascending those opposite, the visitor will\r\ncome into the West Vestibule, which leads to the rooms of the British\r\nSchool--XVIII., XIX., XX., and XXI. Finally, at the east end of the\r\nGallery, we reach Room XXII., devoted to the Turner Collection. For\r\nremarks on the British School see Volume II. From the Entrance Hall,\r\nthe visitor reaches the West Basement, and by corresponding stairs on\r\nthe other side the East Basement.

James Barry,\r\nthe R. A., was \"amazed at finding the realities of the Alps grander\r\nthan the imaginations of Salvator,\" and writes to Edmund Burke from\r\nTurin in 1766 to say that he saw the moon from the Mont Cenis five\r\ntimes as big as usual, \"from being so much nearer to it\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMERICAL CATALOGUE, WITH BIOGRAPHICAL AND DESCRIPTIVE NOTES\r\n\r\nN.

THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.\r\n\r\n  _Sebastiano del Piombo_ (Venetian: 1485-1547).\r\n\r\n      This large picture is generally accounted the masterpiece of\r\n      Sebastiano Luciani. He was called _del Piombo_ (lead), from\r\n      his holding the office of Keeper of the Leaden Seal (see No.\r\n      20). Sebastiano was originally a painter and musician at\r\n      Venice, where he studied successively under John Bellini and\r\n      Giorgione. But in 1512 he was invited to Rome by the famous\r\n      banker Agostino Chigi. Here he fell under the influence of\r\n      Michael Angelo, who employed Sebastiano to execute several of\r\n      his designs, and saw in him a means, says Vasari, of outdoing\r\n      Raphael. The opportunity occurred when the Cardinal Giulio de'\r\n      Medici commissioned Raphael to paint the \"Transfiguration\"\r\n      (now in the Vatican), and at the same time Sebastiano to\r\n      paint this picture, on the same scale, of the Raising of\r\n      Lazarus. The pictures when finished were exhibited side by\r\n      side, and there were some who preferred Sebastiano's. \"The\r\n      picture was painted,\" says Vasari, \"with the utmost care,\r\n      under the direction, and in some parts with the design, of\r\n      Michael Angelo.\" There are in the British Museum two original\r\n      drawings by Michael Angelo which are evidently preparatory\r\n      studies for the figure of Lazarus; but Sebastiano cannot have\r\n      painted under his friend's direction, for Michael Angelo was\r\n      at Florence at the time, and Sebastiano writes to him, \"There\r\n      has been some delay with my work. I have endeavoured to keep\r\n      it back as long as possible, that Raphael might not see it\r\n      before it is finished.... But now I do not hesitate any more. I\r\n      believe I shall not, with my work, bring discredit upon you.\"\r\n      Another masterpiece of Sebastiano has recently been added to\r\n      the Gallery (1450), which also contains two of his portrait\r\n      pieces (20 and 24), a branch of art in which he obtained great\r\n      success; Vasari particularly notices his skill in painting the\r\n      head and hands.\r\n\r\nThis famous picture is especially remarkable for its dramatic unity.\r\nIt is crowded with figures, but all combine to concentrate attention\r\non the central subject. The time chosen by the painter is after the\r\ncompletion of the miracle: \"He that was dead came forth, bound hand and\r\nfoot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin.\"\r\nJesus in the middle of the picture is uttering the words, \"Loose him,\r\nand let him go;\" with his right hand Jesus points to heaven, as if he\r\nsaid, \"I have raised thee by the power of him who sent me.\" The three\r\nmen, who have already removed the lid of the sepulchre, are fulfilling\r\nChrist's command. The grave-clothes, by which the face of Lazarus is\r\nthrown into deep shade, express the idea of the night of the grave\r\nwhich but just before enveloped him; and the eye looking eagerly\r\nfrom beneath the shade upon Christ shows the new life in its most\r\nintellectual organ. To the left, behind Christ, is St. John, answering\r\nobjections raised against the credibility of the miracle. Farther off,\r\nbehind this group, is one of the Pharisees, whose unbelief is combated\r\nby the man who points in evidence to the raised Lazarus. Behind Lazarus\r\nis his sister Martha, sickening now at what she most desired; behind\r\nher are other women--holding their noses.[38] At the foot of Jesus is\r\nthe other sister, Mary, full of faith and gratitude--\r\n\r\n    Her eyes are homes of silent prayer,\r\n      Nor other thought her mind admits\r\n      But, he was dead, and there he sits,\r\n    And he that brought him back is there.\r\n\r\n    Then one deep love doth supersede\r\n      All other, when her ardent gaze\r\n      Roves from the living brother's face,\r\n    And rests upon the Life indeed.\r\n\r\n  TENNYSON: _In Memoriam_, xxxii.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CEPHALUS AND PROCRIS.\r\n\r\n  _Claude Lorraine_ (French: 1600-1682).\r\n\r\n      Claude Gellée was the son of humble parents, and to the end he\r\n      was an unlettered man. He was born in the village of Champagne,\r\n      in the Vosges, Duchy of Lorraine, and thence acquired the name\r\n      of _Le Lorrain_. Lineal descendants of Claude's brother still\r\n      live in the village, and the house in which he was born is\r\n      now preserved as a museum of relics of the painter. He was\r\n      brought up, it is said, as a pastry-cook, but he entered the\r\n      household of Agostino Tassi, a Perugian landscape painter, at\r\n      Rome, in the capacity of general factotum, cooking his master's\r\n      meals and grinding his colours. From him Claude received his\r\n      first instruction in art. Subsequently he travelled to the\r\n      Tyrol and to Venice--the influence of which place may be seen\r\n      in the \"gentle ripples of waveless seas\" in his Seaports.\r\n      After working for some time at Nancy, the capital of Lorraine,\r\n      he returned in October 1627 to Rome, and there settled down\r\n      for the remainder of his life. The house which he inhabited\r\n      may still be seen at the angle of the streets Sistina and\r\n      Gregoriana. Of his life at Rome many interesting particulars\r\n      are given by his friend Sandrart, a German painter, who was for\r\n      some years his companion. \"In order,\" says Sandrart, \"that he\r\n      might be able to study closely the innermost secrets of nature,\r\n      he used to linger in the open air from before daybreak even to\r\n      nightfall, so that he might learn to depict with a scrupulous\r\n      adherence to nature's model the changing phases of dawn, the\r\n      rising and setting sun, as well as the hours of twilight....\r\n      In this most difficult and toilsome mode of study he spent\r\n      many years; making excursions into the country every day, and\r\n      returning even after a long journey without finding it irksome.\r\n      Sometimes I have chanced to meet him amongst the steepest\r\n      cliffs at Tivoli, handling the brush before those well-known\r\n      waterfalls, and painting the actual scene, not by the aid of\r\n      imagination or invention, but according to the very objects\r\n      which nature placed before him.\"[39] (One of these sketches\r\n      is now in the British Museum.) On one expedition to Tivoli,\r\n      Claude was accompanied, we know, by Poussin, but for the most\r\n      part he lived a secluded life; \"he did not,\" says Sandrart, \"in\r\n      everyday life much affect the civilities of polite society.\"\r\n      Such seclusion must partly have been necessary to enable\r\n      Claude to cope with the commissions that crowded in upon him.\r\n      For the Pope Urban VIII. he painted the four pictures now in\r\n      the Louvre, and the three succeeding popes were all among his\r\n      patrons. So was Cardinal Mazarin and the Duke of Bouillon, the\r\n      Papal Commander-in-Chief, for whom amongst other pictures he\r\n      painted two (12 and 14) in this Gallery. England was a great\r\n      buyer of his works: nineteen were ordered from here in 1644\r\n      alone; and commissions came also from Denmark and the Low\r\n      Countries. One sees the pressure of a busy man in the number\r\n      of \"stock\" subjects which he repeated. He suffered much too\r\n      from forgers, and it was partly to check the sale of fictitious\r\n      Claudes that he prepared his \"Liber Veritatis\"--a collection\r\n      of drawings of all his pictures, now in the possession of\r\n      the Duke of Devonshire. Two hundred and seventy more of his\r\n      drawings may be seen in the British Museum. For his figures,\r\n      however, he was glad of outside help, and many painters put\r\n      these in for him. The soft, pensive, and almost feminine charm\r\n      which characterises his landscapes well agree with what we know\r\n      of his life. He was passionately fond of music. To a little\r\n      girl, \"living with me and brought up in my house in charity,\"\r\n      he bequeathed much of his treasures. He had received also a\r\n      poor, lame lad into his house, whom he instructed in painting\r\n      and music, and who rewarded him by demanding arrears of salary\r\n      for \"assistance.\" Towards his poor relations he was uniformly\r\n      generous, and when Sandrart left him it was a nephew from the\r\n      Vosges whom he called to keep house for him.\r\n\r\n      With regard to the characteristics of Claude's art, his general\r\n      position in the history of landscape painting has been defined\r\n      in the chapter on the French School, and some further points\r\n      of detail are noticed under his several works. Here, however,\r\n      it may be convenient to give Ruskin's summary of the matter.\r\n      (1) Claude had a fine feeling for beauty of form, and is seldom\r\n      ungraceful in his foliage. His tenderness of conception is\r\n      especially shown in delicate aerial effects, such as no one\r\n      had ever rendered before, and in some respects, no one has\r\n      ever done in oil-colour since. But their character appears to\r\n      rise rather from a delicacy of bodily constitution in Claude\r\n      than from any mental sensibility; such as they are, they give\r\n      a kind of feminine charm to his work, which partly accounts\r\n      for its wide influence. To whatever their character may be\r\n      traced, it renders him incapable of enjoying or painting\r\n      anything energetic or terrible. Thus a perfectly genuine and\r\n      untouched sky of Claude is beyond praise in all qualities of\r\n      air. But he was incapable of rendering great effects of space\r\n      and infinity. (2) As with his skies, so too with his seas.\r\n      They are the finest pieces of water painting in ancient art.\r\n      But they are selections of the particular moment when the\r\n      sea is most insipid and characterless. (3) He had sincerity\r\n      of purpose; but in common with the other landscape painters\r\n      of his day, neither earnestness, humility, nor love, such\r\n      as would ever cause him to forget himself. Hence there is\r\n      in his work no simple or honest record of any single truth,\r\n      and his pictures, when examined with reference to essential\r\n      truth, are one mass of error from beginning to end. So far as\r\n      he felt the truth, he tried to be true; but he never felt it\r\n      enough to sacrifice supposed propriety, or habitual method,\r\n      to it. Very few of his sketches and none of his pictures show\r\n      evidence of interest in other natural phenomena than the\r\n      quiet afternoon sunshine which would fall methodically into a\r\n      composition.[40] One would suppose he had never seen scarlet\r\n      in a morning cloud, nor a storm burst on the Apennines. (4)\r\n      He shows a peculiar incapacity of understanding the main\r\n      point of a matter, and of men of name is the best instance\r\n      of a want of imagination, nearly total, borne out by painful\r\n      but untaught study of nature, and much feeling for abstract\r\n      beauty of form, with none whatever for harmony of expression.\r\n      (5) Yet in spite of all his deficiencies Claude effected a\r\n      revolution in art. This revolution consisted in setting the\r\n      sun in heaven. We will give him the credit of this with no\r\n      drawbacks.[41] Till Claude's time no one had seriously thought\r\n      of painting the sun but conventionally; that is so say, as a\r\n      red or yellow star (often), with a face in it, under which\r\n      type it was constantly represented in illumination; else it\r\n      was kept out of the picture, or introduced in fragmentary\r\n      distances, breaking through clouds with almost definite rays.\r\n      Claude first set it in the pictorial heaven (collected from\r\n      _Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. §§ 3, 5,\r\n      14, sec. iii. ch. i. § 9, ch. iii. §§ 13-15, 17; vol. ii. pt.\r\n      iii. sec. ii. ch. ii. § 18; vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. xviii. §§ 22,\r\n      27, and Appendix i.; vol. v. pt. ix. ch. v. §§ 10, 11). This\r\n      summary should show that it is a mistake to represent Ruskin\r\n      as blind to the merits of Claude. He has done full justice\r\n      to Claude's amenity and pensive grace; to the beauty of his\r\n      skies and the skill and charm of his aerial effects. At the\r\n      time when Ruskin began to write _Modern Painters_, Claude was\r\n      still accounted the prince of all landscape painters. The\r\n      estimate of Claude against which Ruskin protested may be found\r\n      in Goethe. \"Claude Lorraine,\" he said, \"knew the real world\r\n      thoroughly, even to its smallest detail, and he made use of it\r\n      to express the world contained in his own beautiful soul. He\r\n      stands to nature in a double relation,--he is both her slave\r\n      and her master: her slave, by the material means which he is\r\n      obliged to employ to make himself understood; her master,\r\n      because he subordinates these material means to a well reasoned\r\n      inspiration, to which he makes them serve as instruments.\"\r\n      And elsewhere, Goethe expresses his admiration for the depth\r\n      and grasp of Claude's powers. Ruskin, in vindicating the\r\n      greater sweep and depth of Turner's genius, fastened with all\r\n      the emphasis of an advocate upon the weak points in Claude's\r\n      artistic and intellectual armoury. By so doing he cleared the\r\n      ground for a truer appreciation of Claude. As a corrective\r\n      or supplement to Ruskin's adverse criticisms, the reader may\r\n      be referred to Constable's enthusiastic appreciations. \"I\r\n      do not wonder,\" wrote Constable to his wife, \"at you being\r\n      jealous of Claude. If anything could come between our love,\r\n      it is him.... The Claudes, the Claudes are all, all, I can\r\n      think of here\" (Leslie's _Life of Constable_, 1845, p. 121).\r\n      Constable was writing from Sir George Beaumont's house, where\r\n      several of the Claudes, now in the National Gallery, were then\r\n      hanging. Constable, however, was alive to some of Claude's\r\n      defects. \"Claude's exhilaration and light,\" he wrote to Leslie,\r\n      \"departed from him when he was between fifty and sixty, and he\r\n      then became a professor of the 'higher walks of art,' and fell\r\n      in a great degree into the manner of the painters around him;\r\n      so difficult is it to be natural, so easy to be superior in\r\n      our own opinion. When we have the pleasure of being together\r\n      at the National Gallery I think I shall not find it difficult\r\n      to illustrate these remarks, as Carr has sent a large picture\r\n      of the latter description\" (_ibid._, p. 221). The picture in\r\n      question is No. 6, painted in 1658.\r\n\r\nFor the story of Cephalus, who is here receiving from Procris the\r\npresents of Diana, the hound Lelaps, and the fatal dart with which\r\nshe was killed, see under 698. As for the landscape, Mr. Ruskin cites\r\nthis picture as an instance of the \"childishness and incompetence\" of\r\nClaude's foregrounds.\r\n\r\n\"I will not,\" he writes, \"say anything of the agreeable composition\r\nof the three banks, rising one behind another from the water, except\r\nonly that it amounts to a demonstration that all three were painted\r\nin the artist's study, without any reference to nature whatever. In\r\nfact, there is quite enough intrinsic evidence in each of them to\r\nprove this, seeing that what appears to be meant for vegetation upon\r\nthem amounts to nothing more than a green stain on their surfaces,\r\nthe more evidently false because the leaves of the trees twenty yards\r\nfarther off are all perfectly visible and distinct; and that the sharp\r\nlines with which each cuts against that beyond it are not only such\r\nas crumbling earth could never show or assume, but are maintained\r\nthrough their whole progress ungraduated, unchanging, and unaffected\r\nby any of the circumstances of varying shade to which every one of\r\nnature's lines is inevitably subjected. In fact the whole arrangement\r\nis the impotent struggle of a tyro to express by successive edges that\r\napproach of earth which he finds himself incapable of expressing by the\r\ndrawing of the surface. Claude wished to make you understand that the\r\nedge of his pond came nearer and nearer; he had probably often tried to\r\ndo this with an unbroken bank, or a bank only varied by the delicate\r\nand harmonious anatomy of nature: and he had found that owing to his\r\ntotal ignorance of the laws of perspective such efforts on his part\r\ninvariably ended in his reducing his pond to the form of a round O, and\r\nmaking it look perpendicular. Much comfort and solace of mind in such\r\nunpleasant circumstances may be derived from instantly dividing the\r\nobnoxious bank into a number of successive promontories, and developing\r\ntheir edges with completeness and intensity\" (_Modern Painters_, vol.\r\ni. pt. ii. sec. iv. ch. iv. §§ 17, 18).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. A CONCERT.\r\n\r\n  _School of Titian_ (Venetian). _See under next picture._\r\n\r\n      The young man in the red velvet cap plays on the violoncello;\r\n      the other on the oboe, of which only the reed is visible. The\r\n      other three are vocalists. The master is keeping time, and is\r\n      intent on the boy pupil. The young girl, with her hand on her\r\n      husband's shoulder, is waiting to chime in, and looks far away\r\n      the while to where the music takes her. \"In Titian's portraits\r\n      you always see the soul,--faces 'which pale passion loves.'\r\n      Look at the Music-piece by Titian--it is 'all ear,'--the\r\n      expression is evanescent as the sounds--the features are seen\r\n      in a sort of dim _chiaroscuro_, as if the confused impressions\r\n      of another sense intervened--and you might easily suppose some\r\n      of the performers to have been engaged the night before in\r\n\r\n        Mask or midnight serenade\r\n    Which the starved lover to his mistress sings\r\n        Best quitted with disdain.\"\r\n\r\n  (HAZLITT: _Criticisms on Art_, edition 1843, p. 10).\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is indeed a travelling party of musicians practising for\r\na serenade. Certainly one thinks of this picture as one reads of a\r\nsupper party at Titian's house. \"Before the tables were set out, we\r\nspent the time in looking at the lifelike figures in the excellent\r\npaintings of which the house was full, and in discussing the real\r\nbeauty and charm of the garden, which was a pleasure and a wonder to\r\nevery one. It is situated in the extreme part of Venice upon the sea,\r\nand from it may be seen the pretty little island of Murano, and other\r\nbeautiful places. This part of the sea, as soon as the sun went down,\r\nswarmed with gondolas adorned with beautiful women, and resounded with\r\nvaried harmonies--the music of voices and instruments till midnight\"\r\n(Priscianese, describing a visit to Titian in 1540: cited in Heath's\r\n_Titian_, \"Great Artists\" series, p. 53).\r\n\r\n\r\n4. A HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Titian_ (Venetian: 1477-1576).\r\n\r\n      Tiziano Vecellio--\"il divino Tiziano,\" as his countrymen called\r\n      him--is one of the greatest names in the history of painting:\r\n      \"There is a strange undercurrent of everlasting murmur about\r\n      his name, which means the deep consent of all great men that\r\n      he is greater than they\" (_Two Paths_, § 57). Titian's works\r\n      \"are not art,\" said one of his contemporaries, \"but miracles;\r\n      they make upon me the impression of something divine, and as\r\n      heaven is the soul's paradise, so God has transfused into\r\n      Titian's colours the paradise of our bodies.\" It is not easy,\r\n      however, to point out the special characteristics of Titian,\r\n      for it is his glory to offer nothing over-prominent and to\r\n      keep \"in all things the middle path of perfection.\" Titian's\r\n      mind was \"wholly realist, universal, and manly. He saw that\r\n      sensual passion in man was not only a fact, but a Divine fact;\r\n      the human creature, though the highest of the animals, was,\r\n      nevertheless, a perfect animal, and his happiness, health, and\r\n      nobleness depended on the due power of every animal passion,\r\n      as well as the cultivation of every spiritual tendency\"\r\n      (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. iii. § 30). As a youth\r\n      Titian worked under the influence of Giorgione, of whom (says\r\n      Vasari), \"they who were excellent confessed that he was born\r\n      to put the breath of life into painted figures and to imitate\r\n      the elasticity and colour of flesh.\" The so-called \"Sacred\r\n      and Profane Love\" of Titian marks the culmination of his\r\n      \"Giorgionesque\" style, in which sensuous delight and spiritual\r\n      yearning are mixed in subtle harmony. The \"Bacchus and Ariadne\"\r\n      of our own Gallery belongs to a somewhat later date, and is a\r\n      combination of poetry and painting almost unique in the world\r\n      of art. \"One object,\" says Sir Frederick Burton,[42] \"Titian\r\n      kept steadily before him from the beginning--the rendering\r\n      of the lustre of the skin in its warmth, its pearliness, and\r\n      its light, such as it is found in the European races, and\r\n      nowhere perhaps in such perfection as in the blended northern\r\n      and southern blood of Venetia. He presents to us humanity in\r\n      its noblest and most beautiful forms, and so profoundly had\r\n      he studied it that the ideal personages introduced in his\r\n      pictures have an intense individuality. Naturally, therefore,\r\n      he stands supreme amongst the great portrait-painters. In the\r\n      department of landscape he was, if not the first to perceive,\r\n      at least the first to render, nature in her sublimer aspects.\r\n      When dealing with classical themes he thoroughly translated\r\n      the spirit, without idly imitating the forms, of antiquity.\"\r\n      And as the range of his intellectual sympathy was wide, so\r\n      was that of his executive skill. He is, indeed, especially\r\n      supreme as a colourist; but for the rest, the very greatness\r\n      of the master lies in there being no one quality predominant\r\n      in him. Raphael's power is properly called \"Raphaelesque,\" but\r\n      \"Titian's power is simply the power of doing right. Whatever\r\n      came before Titian, he did wholly as it _ought_ to be done\"\r\n      (_Two Paths_, §§ 57, 58, 69).\r\n\r\n      This universality of Titian's art is reflected in his life--a\r\n      life prolonged far beyond the ordinary human spell, and full\r\n      to the end of \"superhuman toil.\" He was sent from his country\r\n      home at Cadore to Venice to begin his studies when quite a\r\n      boy: he was only nine, it is said, when he entered Gentile\r\n      Bellini's studio. He lived to be ninety-nine, and his life\r\n      was one long education. He was nearly threescore years and\r\n      ten when he visited Rome and saw Michael Angelo, but he \"had\r\n      greatly improved,\" he said in later years, \"after he had been\r\n      at Rome.\" He painted until his dying hour, and is said to have\r\n      exclaimed at the last that he was \"only then beginning to\r\n      understand what painting was.\" This continual striving after\r\n      perfection, this consciousness of falling short, is in striking\r\n      contrast to the honour and glory paid to him by others. He was\r\n      painter in ordinary to the Venetian State (a post in which he\r\n      succeeded Giovanni Bellini). He was an honoured guest at the\r\n      court of Alphonso I., Duke of Ferrara, for whom he painted\r\n      the \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" (35). To the Emperor Charles V. he\r\n      \"stood as Apelles to Alexander the Great, the only man worthy\r\n      to paint his royal master,\" and he was made Count Palatine and\r\n      Knight of the Golden Spur, with precedence for his children as\r\n      nobles of the Empire. The emperor's son, Philip II. (of Spain),\r\n      was an equally generous patron; the Pope Paul III. tried hard\r\n      to induce Titian to settle in Rome; and Henry III. of France,\r\n      who visited him at his own house, wished the picture on which\r\n      the painter was then at work to be placed over his tomb. In\r\n      his house at Venice Titian lived in great style, attracting\r\n      kings and nobles and men of letters to him. There is all the\r\n      keenness of a city of merchants in Titian's business relations,\r\n      and many of the extant documents about him are petitions for\r\n      further favours and for arrears of pensions. But if he gathered\r\n      like a beggar, he spent like a prince. There is a story of two\r\n      cardinals coming to dine at his house. He flung his purse to\r\n      the steward, and bade him make ready, for \"all the world was\r\n      coming to dine with him.\" Certain too it is that if he knocked\r\n      too much at the doors of princes, it was for the sake of his\r\n      children rather than of himself. At the loss of his wife (when\r\n      he was fifty-seven) he was \"utterly disconsolate,\" says the\r\n      letter of a friend. His sister Orsa afterwards kept house for\r\n      him--\"sister, daughter, mother, companion, and steward of his\r\n      household,\" so Aretino described her; and it was his daughter\r\n      Lavinia whom he oftenest loved to paint. She was \"the person\r\n      dearest to him in all the world,\" and many years after she\r\n      had died (1560) in childbirth, he described her to Philip II.\r\n      as \"absolute mistress of his soul.\" A less pleasant light is\r\n      thrown upon the great painter by his friendship and close\r\n      association with the infamous Aretino. This curious product\r\n      of the Renaissance came to Venice in 1527, and with Titian\r\n      and Jacopo del Sansovino formed \"the so-called Triumvirate,\r\n      which was a kind of Council of Three, having as its _raison\r\n      d'être_ the mutual furtherance of material interests, and the\r\n      pursuit of art, love, and pleasure.\" To Titian's association\r\n      with Aretino some critics have ascribed the stronger vein of\r\n      sensuality which is discernible in some of his later works. To\r\n      the extreme limit, however, of his long life his hand never\r\n      lost its cunning, nor was the force of imagination abated. He\r\n      was carried off by the plague, and received even in that time\r\n      of panic the honour of solemn obsequies in the church of the\r\n      Frari--\"the man as highly favoured,\" says Vasari, \"by fortune\r\n      as any of his kind had ever been before him.\" His house at\r\n      Venice is still shown. It looks across the lagoons to the\r\n      distant mountains of his early home.\r\n\r\nOne of the pictures which mark the advance made by Titian in the art\r\nof landscape. Look at the background of some earlier Holy Family--at\r\nthe \"purist\" landscape, for instance, of Perugino (288),--and the\r\nchange will be seen at once--a change from the conventional or ideal to\r\nthe real and the actual. Titian was one of the first to \"relieve the\r\nforeground of his landscapes from the grotesque, quaint, and crowded\r\nformalism of the early painters, and give a close approximation to the\r\nforms of nature in all things; retaining, however, this much of the\r\nold system, that the distances were for the most part painted in deep\r\nultramarine blue, the foregrounds in rich green and brown\" (_Lectures\r\non Architecture and Painting_, p. 158). In particular he was the\r\nfirst[43] to \"apprehend the subduing pathos that comes with eventide\"\r\n(see Gilbert's _Cadore_ or _Titian's Country_, p. 33). Titian, says\r\nRuskin (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ii. § 1, ch. vii. § 15), \"hardly\r\never paints sunshine, but a certain opalescent twilight which has as\r\nmuch of human emotion as of imitative truth in it:\r\n\r\n    The clouds that gather round the setting sun\r\n    Do take a sober colouring from an eye\r\n    That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5. A SEAPORT AT SUNSET.\r\n\r\n  _Claude Lorraine_ (French: 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\nAn instance of false tone (_cf._ under Cuyp, No. 53). \"Many even of the\r\nbest pictures of Claude must be looked close into to be felt, and lose\r\nlight every foot that we retire. The smallest of the three Seaports in\r\nthe National Gallery is valuable and right in tone when we are close to\r\nit, but ten yards off it is all brick-dust, offensively and evidently\r\nfalse in its whole hue.\" Contrast \"the perfect and unchanging influence\r\nof Turner's picture at any distance. We approach only to follow the\r\nsunshine into every cranny of the leafage, and retire only to feel it\r\ndiffused over the scene, the whole picture glowing like a sun or star\r\nat whatever distance we stand, and lighting the air between us and it\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. i. § 20).\r\n\r\n\r\n6. DAVID AT THE CAVE OF ADULLAM.[44]\r\n\r\n  _Claude Lorraine_ (French: 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\nDavid, in front of the cave, \"longed and said, 'Oh that one would give\r\nme to drink of the water of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!' And the\r\nthree mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines (seen in the\r\nvalley), and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the\r\ngate, and took it, and brought it to David\" (2 Samuel xxiii. 15, 16).\r\nWith regard to the landscape, the picture is a good instance at once\r\nof Claude's strength and weakness. Thus \"the central group of trees is\r\na very noble piece of painting\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii.\r\nsec. iv. ch. ii. § 8). On the other hand the rocks, both in the left\r\ncorner and in the right, are highly absurd. \"The Claudesque landscape\r\nis not, as so commonly supposed, an idealised abstract of the nature\r\nabout Rome. It is an ultimate condition of the Florentine conventional\r\nlandscape, more or less softened by reference to nature\" (_ibid._,\r\nvol. iii. pt. iv. ch. xviii. § 27). So, too, \"the brown foreground and\r\nrocks are as false as colour can be: first, because there never was\r\nsuch a brown sunlight, for even the sand and cinders (volcanic tufa)\r\nabout Naples, granting that he had studied from these ugliest of all\r\nformations, are, where they are fresh fractured, golden and lustrous\r\nin full light, compared to these ideals of crags, and become, like all\r\nother rocks, quiet and gray when weathered; and secondly, because no\r\nrock that ever nature stained is without its countless breaking tints\r\nof varied vegetation\" (_ibid._, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. ii. § 16).\r\n\r\n\r\n7, 37. GROUPS OF HEADS.\r\n\r\n  _After Correggio. See under 10._\r\n\r\nCopies by Annibale Carracci from Correggio's compositions in the church\r\nof S. Giovanni at Parma (Layard's edition of Kugler's _Italian School\r\nof Painting_, ii. 631). These pictures have had an eventful history,\r\nand been connected with the fortunes of many sovereigns. They came to\r\nthe National Gallery from Mr. Angerstein, who bought them from the\r\nOrleans collection. They had formerly been in the possession of Queen\r\nChristina, having been carried off to Sweden as part of the plunder of\r\nPrague when that city was captured by the Swedes in 1648. The pictures\r\ncollected there by the Emperor Rudolph II. were removed to Stockholm.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. A DREAM OF HUMAN LIFE.\r\n\r\n  _From a design by Michael Angelo. See 790._\r\n\r\nThe naked figure, typical of the human race, and reclining against a\r\nslippery globe,--with the world, we may say, before him,--is awakening,\r\nat the sound of a trumpet from above from the dream of life to the\r\nlasting realities of eternity. It may be the sound of the \"last trump\"\r\nor the call to a \"new life\" that comes before. Behind his seat are\r\nseveral masks, illustrating the insincerity or duplicity of a world\r\nin which \"all is vanity\"; and around him are visions of the tempting\r\nand transitory hopes, fears, and vices of humanity. On the right sits\r\na helmed warrior, moody and discomfited; his arms hang listlessly and\r\nhis face is unseen--hidden perhaps from the cruelty of War. Above\r\nhim are battling figures--emblematic of Strife and Contention. A\r\nlittle detached from this group is a son dragging down his parent by\r\nthe beard--\"bringing his grey hair with sorrow to the grave.\" On the\r\nother side sits Jealousy, gnawing a heart; and above are the sordid\r\nhands of Avarice clutching a bag of gold. On the left hand Lust and\r\nSorrow are conspicuous; Intemperance raises a huge bottle to his lips;\r\nand Gluttony turns a spit (see Landseer's _Catalogue of the National\r\nGallery_, 1834, p. 41). Thus all around the figure of Human Life there\r\nwait--\r\n\r\n    The ministers of human fate\r\n      And black Misfortune's baleful train!...\r\n    These shall the fury Passions tear,\r\n      The vultures of the mind,\r\n    Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear,\r\n      And shame that sculks behind;\r\n    Or pining Love shall waste their youth,\r\n      Or Jealousy, with rankling tooth,\r\n        That inly gnaws the secret heart;\r\n      And Envy wan, and faded Care,\r\n      Grim-visag'd comfortless Despair,\r\n        And Sorrow's piercing dart.\r\n\r\n  GRAY: _Ode on a distant prospect of Eton College_.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. \"LORD, WHITHER GOEST THOU?\"\r\n\r\n  _Annibale Carracci_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1560-1609).\r\n\r\n      Annibale, younger brother of Agostino and cousin of Lodovico\r\n      Carracci, was one of the three masters of the Eclectic School\r\n      at Bologna, the characteristics of which have been discussed in\r\n      the chapter on the Later Italian Schools. Annibale, the most\r\n      distinguished of the family as a painter, was the son of a\r\n      tailor and was intended for his father's business. He went off,\r\n      however, to his cousin Lodovico, with whom he devoted himself\r\n      to art. In 1580 he visited Parma, where he spent three years in\r\n      studying the works of Correggio. The copies noticed above (7\r\n      and 37) were perhaps made at this time. Annibale afterwards\r\n      studied in Venice. In 1589 the school of the Carracci was\r\n      started at Bologna. They called it the _Incamminati_, or, as we\r\n      might say, \"The Right Road.\" In 1600 Annibale was invited to\r\n      Rome by the Cardinal Odoardo Farnese to decorate his palace.\r\n      Here, we are told, \"he was received and treated as a gentleman,\r\n      and was granted the usual table allowance of a courtier.\"\r\n      He was assisted in the Farnese frescoes by Lanfranco, by\r\n      Domenichino (then a young man), and by his brother Agostino,\r\n      of whom, however, he was very jealous (_see under_ 147). He\r\n      died in 1609, and was buried near Raphael in the Pantheon. The\r\n      frescoes of the Carracci in the Farnese palace were preferred\r\n      by Poussin to all the works in Rome after those of Raphael,\r\n      and they undoubtedly possess many technical merits. The\r\n      subject-pictures by Annibale in our Gallery will fail greatly\r\n      to please; they are academical and unindividual, and are\r\n      deficient in true enthusiasm. Annibale was one of the first to\r\n      practise landscape-painting as a separate department of art. In\r\n      this field the influence of the Netherlands and of Venice may\r\n      be seen united in Carracci's pictures, which in their turn laid\r\n      the foundation for Poussin and Claude. In our Gallery Annibale\r\n      is seen at his best in the two poetic subjects painted for a\r\n      harpsichord (93 and 94); these are both graceful and spirited.\r\n\r\nThe Apostle Peter, according to a Roman tradition, being terrified at\r\nthe danger which threatened him in Rome, betook himself to flight.\r\nOn the Via Appia our Saviour appeared to him bearing his cross. To\r\nPeter's question: Domine quo vadis? (\"Lord, whither goest Thou?\")\r\nChrist replied, \"To Rome, to suffer again crucifixion.\" Upon which\r\nthe apostle retraced his steps, and received the crown of martyrdom.\r\nSo much for the subject. As for its treatment, the note of almost\r\ncomic exaggeration in St. Peter's attitude will not fail to strike the\r\nspectator; and \"there is this objection to be made to the landscape,\r\nthat, though the day is breaking over the distant hills and pediment on\r\nthe right hand, there must be another sun somewhere out of the picture\r\non the left hand, since the cast shadows from St. Peter and the Saviour\r\nfall directly to the right\" (Landseer's _Catalogue_, p. 193).\r\n\r\n\r\n10. THE EDUCATION OF CUPID.\r\n\r\n  _Correggio_ (Parmese: 1494-1534).\r\n\r\n      Antonio Allegri--called Il Correggio from his birthplace, a\r\n      small town near Modena--is one of the most distinctive of\r\n      the old masters. What is it that constitutes what Carlyle\r\n      (following Sterne) calls the \"Correggiosity of Correggio\"? It\r\n      is at once a way peculiar to him amongst artists, of looking\r\n      at the world, and an excellence, peculiar to him also, in his\r\n      methods of painting. Correggio \"looked at the world in a single\r\n      mood of sensuous joy,\" as a place in which everything is full\r\n      of happy life and soft pleasure. The characteristics of his\r\n      style are \"sidelong grace,\" and an all-pervading sweetness.\r\n      The method, peculiar to him, by which he realised this way\r\n      of looking at things on canvas, is the subtle gradation of\r\n      colours,--a point, it is interesting to note, in which of all\r\n      modern masters Leighton most nearly resembles him (_Art of\r\n      England_, p. 98). \"Correggio is,\" says Ruskin, \"the captain\r\n      of the painter's art as such. Other men have nobler or more\r\n      numerous gifts, but as a painter, master of the art of laying\r\n      colour so as to be lovely, Correggio is alone\" (_Oxford\r\n      Lectures on Art_, § 177). The circumstances of Correggio's life\r\n      go far to explain the individuality of his style. He was the\r\n      son of a modest, peaceful burgher, and Correggio and Parma,\r\n      where he spent his life, were towns removed from the greater\r\n      intellectual excitements and political revolutions of his time.\r\n      Ignorant of society, unpatronised by Popes or great Princes,\r\n      his mind was touched by no deep passion other than love for\r\n      his art, and \"like a poet hidden in the light of thought,\" he\r\n      worked out for himself the ideals of grace and movement which\r\n      live in his pictures (see Symonds, _Renaissance_, iii. 248). Of\r\n      the details of his life little is known. His earliest works,\r\n      as Morelli first demonstrated, reveal the influence of the\r\n      Ferrarese masters, nor was he untouched by the creations of\r\n      Mantegna at Mantua, where he studied for two or three years. In\r\n      1514, in his twentieth year, he was entrusted with an important\r\n      commission by the Minorite Friars of Correggio. The Court of\r\n      Correggio was then a centre of refinement and culture, under\r\n      the rule of Giberto and his wife Veronica, who was one of the\r\n      most accomplished women of the day, and greatly admired \"our\r\n      Antonio,\" as she called the painter. In 1518 Correggio left his\r\n      native city for Parma, which was to become for ever associated\r\n      with his name. \"There is little reason,\" says his latest\r\n      biographer, \"to lament that he never visited Rome or any other\r\n      great city. Parma, rising in smiling tranquillity upon her\r\n      fertile plains, girdled by castles and villages, and looking\r\n      out upon the vaporous line of hills from which the streams\r\n      which give her water descend into the champaign, offered our\r\n      painter not only the serenity that suited his temperament,\r\n      but a vaster field of activity than had ever been allotted to\r\n      any artist. There were altar-pieces to be painted, rooms to\r\n      be decorated; and the joyous fancies of his genius were to be\r\n      allowed ample scope in the decoration of two stately cupolas\"\r\n      (Ricci). He was first employed by the Abbess of the Convent of\r\n      S. Paolo to paint her principal chamber. It is characteristic\r\n      of the time that the subjects selected were from pagan\r\n      mythology. Afterwards Correggio was commissioned to cover with\r\n      frescoes the cupolas of the Church of S. Giovanni Evangelista,\r\n      and of the cathedral. In these compositions, Correggio \"carries\r\n      the foreshortening of the figures to a point which, while it\r\n      displays the daring of the artist, too often transcends the\r\n      limits of grace.\" Seen from below, little of the figures is\r\n      sometimes distinguishable except legs and arms in vehement\r\n      commotion. When one of the frescoes in the cathedral was first\r\n      uncovered, a canon is said to have remarked that it looked\r\n      to him like a \"fricassee of frogs.\" But many of the angels'\r\n      heads in Correggio's frescoes are exquisitely beautiful. It is\r\n      only in Parma that Correggio's power can be fully appreciated.\r\n      His charm is to be found rather in his oil-paintings, and\r\n      in these the National Gallery possesses some acknowledged\r\n      masterpieces. In 1530 Correggio lost his wife, and returned to\r\n      his native town. \"Although by nature good and well-disposed, he\r\n      nevertheless,\" says Vasari, \"grieved more than was reasonable\r\n      under the burden of those passions which are common to all men.\r\n      He was very melancholic in the exercise of his art, and felt\r\n      its fatigues greatly.\" His life was but little longer than that\r\n      of Raphael, for he died in his forty-first year. The stories of\r\n      his poverty given in many biographies appear to be ill-founded.\r\n      He was in constant employment; he was treated as a person of\r\n      consideration, and received good remuneration; and the Governor\r\n      of Parma wrote to the Duke of Mantua on the painter's death,\r\n      \"I hear he has made comfortable provision for his heirs.\" His\r\n      fame was great, and has been enduring; but his influence upon\r\n      later art was not fortunate. \"His successors, attracted by an\r\n      intoxicating loveliness which they could not analyse, threw\r\n      themselves blindly into the imitation of Correggio's faults....\r\n      Cupolas through the length and breadth of Italy began to be\r\n      covered with clouds and simpering cherubs in the convulsions\r\n      of artificial ecstasy. The attenuated elegance of Parmigiano,\r\n      the attitudinising of Anselmi's saints and angels, and a\r\n      general sacrifice of what is solid and enduring to sentimental\r\n      gewgaws on the part of all painters who had submitted to the\r\n      magic of Correggio, proved how easy it was to go astray with\r\n      the great master. Meanwhile, no one could approach him in that\r\n      which was truly his own--the delineation of a transient moment\r\n      in the life of sensuous beauty, the painting of a smile on\r\n      Nature's face, when light and colour tremble in harmony with\r\n      the movement of joyous living creatures\" (Symonds: _Sketches\r\n      and Studies in Italy and Greece_, ii. 158).\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated works in the Gallery--\"the two pictures\r\nwhich I would last part with out of it,\" Ruskin once said, \"would be\r\nTitian's Bacchus and Correggio's Venus.\" It is a great picture first\r\nbecause it is true to nature. \"Look at the foot of Venus. Correggio\r\nmade it as like a foot as he could, and you won't easily find anything\r\nliker.... Great civilised art is always the representation, to the\r\nutmost of its power, of whatever it has got to show--made to look as\r\nlike the thing as possible\" (_Queen of the Air_, § 163). Notice, too,\r\nthe roundness of effect produced in the limbs by the gradation of\r\nfull colours, the reflected lights, and the transparent shadows. The\r\n\"chiaroscuro\" is so clever that you can look through the shadows into\r\nthe substance.\r\n\r\nAs for the subject of the picture, Mercury, the messenger of the gods\r\n(dressed therefore in his winged cap and sandals), is endeavouring\r\nto teach Cupid (Love) his letters, of which, according to the Greek\r\nstory, Mercury was the inventor. Venus, the Goddess of Beauty and the\r\nMother of Love, looks out to the spectator with a winning smile of\r\nself-complacent loveliness and points us to the child. She has taken\r\ncharge meanwhile of Cupid's bow (from which he shoots his arrows into\r\nlovers' hearts), and is herself represented (as sometimes in classical\r\ngems) with wings, for Beauty has wings to fly away as well as Time and\r\nLove. The picture is sometimes called the Education of Cupid, but Love\r\nlearns through the heart and not through the head, and \"if you look at\r\nthis most perfect picture wisely, you will see that it really ought to\r\nbe called 'Mercury trying, _and failing_, to teach Cupid to read,' for\r\nindeed from the beginning and to the end of time, Love reads without\r\nletters, and counts without arithmetic\" (_Fors Clavigera_, viii. 238).\r\n\r\nThis famous picture has had a strange, eventful history. It was\r\npainted in 1521 or 1522, and a century later it was still in the Ducal\r\nGallery at Mantua. In 1625 Charles I. of England despatched his music\r\nmaster, Nicholas Laniere, to Italy to buy pictures for him. Laniere\r\ncommunicated with a picture-dealer named Nys, who purchased several\r\nworks from the Mantuan gallery. When the transaction became known,\r\nthe citizens took it so ill that the Duke would have paid double the\r\nmoney to be rid of the bargain. But Nys would not relent, and the\r\npicture was included in the artistic freight which the ship _Margaret_\r\ntook to London in 1628. On its arrival, our picture was hung in the\r\nking's private apartments in Whitehall. When he was beheaded, and his\r\ncollection sold, the Correggio was bought for £40 by the Duke of Alva,\r\nand taken to Spain. It afterwards passed through several collections,\r\nand ultimately into that of Murat, King of Naples. Upon his fall from\r\npower his wife took it with her when she escaped to Vienna. During\r\nthe congress of sovereigns in 1822 her chamberlain communicated with\r\nthe ministers of all the Powers, with a view to the sale of this and\r\nanother Correggio (15). Russia was negotiating for the purchase of them\r\nwhen Lord Londonderry, hearing by mere accident of the affair, went to\r\nthe chamberlain, paid the larger price against which Russia was holding\r\nout, and despatched his courier post haste to Vienna to convey the\r\ntreasures to England. An attempt was made to stop him, but they reached\r\nthis country almost before the Russians had heard of the purchase.[45]\r\nThe picture has not come unscathed out of these changes and chances.\r\n\"Repairs,\" says Sir Edward Poynter, \"are visible in many places.\r\nInjudicious cleaning has done even more injury; and it has undoubtedly\r\nbeen deprived of much of that final delicate surface-painting which,\r\nin the hands of a great master, does so much to unite a picture into\r\none harmonious whole. It remains, nevertheless, one of the most\r\ndistinguished works in the collection\" (_The National Gallery_, i. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n11. ST. JEROME.\r\n\r\n  _Guido Reni_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1575-1642).\r\n\r\n      Guido was a native of Bologna, the son of a musician, and\r\n      first studied under Dionysius Calvaert, a Flemish artist\r\n      established in that city. Guido afterwards removed to the\r\n      school of the Carracci, and became one of their most celebrated\r\n      pupils. For twenty years he worked in Rome, where he obtained\r\n      great distinction. He left Rome abruptly, owing to a dispute\r\n      with one of the Cardinals, and settled in Bologna, where he\r\n      lived in splendour and established a school. \"As a child he\r\n      was very beautiful, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a fair\r\n      complexion. He was specially characterised by devotion to the\r\n      Madonna. On every Christmas-eve, for seven successive years,\r\n      ghostly knockings were heard upon his chamber door; and every\r\n      night, when he awoke from sleep, the darkness above his bed\r\n      was illuminated by a mysterious globe of light. In after life,\r\n      besides being piously addicted to Madonna-worship, he had a\r\n      great dread of women in general and witches in particular.\r\n      He was always careful, it is said, to leave his studio door\r\n      open while drawing from a woman\" (Symonds's _Renaissance_,\r\n      vii. 215). To the temperament thus indicated we may trace the\r\n      half-effeminate, half-spiritual character of some of his\r\n      works--the \"few pale rays of fading sanctity,\" which Ruskin\r\n      sees in him (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. iv. § 4).\r\n      In later life his effeminate eccentricity amounted to insanity,\r\n      and he gave himself wholly up to the gaming table. To extricate\r\n      himself from money troubles he sold his time, says his\r\n      biographer, at a stipulated sum per hour, to certain dealers,\r\n      one of whom tasked him so rigidly as to stand by him, watch in\r\n      hand, while he worked. How different from the honourable terms\r\n      on which the earlier masters worked! How easy to understand the\r\n      number of bad Guidos in the world! His biographer, Malvasia,\r\n      relates that Guido's works were sometimes begun and finished in\r\n      three hours. His earlier works were in the robust and forcible\r\n      style of Caravaggio (_see_ No. 172). Afterwards he aimed rather\r\n      at ideal grace. Both styles are represented in the National\r\n      Gallery; the \"Magdalen\" (177), the \"Youthful Christ embracing\r\n      St. John\" (191), and the \"Ecce Homo\" (271), have all been much\r\n      admired for their sentiment or sentimentality. The head of St.\r\n      John is a work of undoubted grace. But Guido's best work is the\r\n      Aurora of the Rospigliosi Palace at Rome.\r\n\r\nFor the story of St. Jerome, _see_ under 227.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. ISAAC AND REBECCA, OR \"THE MILL.\"[46]\r\n\r\n_Claude_ (French: 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\nThis and the Claude on the other side of the door (14) are of peculiar\r\ninterest as being the two which Turner selected for \"the noble passage\r\nof arms to which he challenged his rival from the grave.\" He left\r\ntwo of his own pictures (479 and 498) to the nation on the express\r\ncondition that they should always hang side by side--as they are\r\nhanging to-day--with these two by Claude.[47] To discuss fully the\r\ncomparative merits of the pictures would be beyond the scope of this\r\nhandbook; the whole of the first volume of _Modern Painters_ was\r\nwritten to establish the superiority of Turner. We can only select a\r\nfew leading points.\r\n\r\n\"The greatest picture is that which conveys the greatest number of the\r\ngreatest ideas.\" Take first what Ruskin calls \"ideas of relation,\" by\r\nwhich he means \"the perception of intellectual relations, including\r\neverything productive of expression, sentiment, character.\" Now from\r\nthis point of view this picture is a particularly clear instance of\r\nClaude's \"inability to see the main point in a matter\" or to present\r\nany harmonious conception:--\r\n\r\n      \"The foreground is a piece of very lovely and perfect forest\r\n      scenery, with a dance of peasants by a brook side; quite enough\r\n      subject to form, in the hands of a master, an impressive and\r\n      complete picture. On the other side of the brook, however, we\r\n      have a piece of pastoral life; a man with some bulls and goats\r\n      tumbling headforemost into the water, owing to some sudden\r\n      paralytic affection of all their legs. Even this group is one\r\n      too many; the shepherd had no business to drive his flock so\r\n      near the dancers, and the dancers will certainly frighten\r\n      the cattle. But when we look farther into the picture, our\r\n      feelings receive a sudden and violent shock, by the unexpected\r\n      appearance, amidst things pastoral and musical, of the\r\n      military; a number of Roman soldiers riding in on hobby-horses,\r\n      with a leader on foot, apparently encouraging them to make an\r\n      immediate and decisive charge on the musicians. Beyond the\r\n      soldiers is a circular temple, in exceedingly bad repair; and\r\n      close beside it, built against its very walls, a neat watermill\r\n      in full work. By the mills flows a large river with a weir all\r\n      across it. The weir has not been made for the mill (for that\r\n      receives its water from the hills by a trough carried over the\r\n      temple), but it is particularly ugly and monotonous in its line\r\n      of fall, and the water below forms a dead-looking pond, on\r\n      which some people are fishing in punts. The banks of this river\r\n      resemble in contour the later geological formations around\r\n      London, constituted chiefly of broken pots and oyster-shells.\r\n      At an inconvenient distance from the waterside stands a city,\r\n      composed of twenty-five round towers and a pyramid. Beyond\r\n      the city is a handsome bridge; beyond the bridge, part of the\r\n      Campagna, with fragments of aqueducts; beyond the Campagna the\r\n      chain of the Alps; on the left, the cascades of Tivoli. This\r\n      is, I believe, a fair example of what is commonly called an\r\n      'ideal' landscape; _i.e._ a group of the artist's studies from\r\n      Nature, individually spoiled, selected with such opposition\r\n      of character as may ensure their neutralising each other's\r\n      effect, and united with sufficient unnaturalness and violence\r\n      of association to ensure their producing a general sensation\r\n      of the impossible. Let us analyse the separate subjects a\r\n      little in this ideal work of Claude's. Perhaps there is no\r\n      more impressive scene on earth than the solitary extent of\r\n      the Campagna of Rome under evening light.... A dull purple\r\n      poisonous haze stretches level along the desert, veiling its\r\n      spectral wrecks of massy ruins, on whose rents the red light\r\n      rests, like dying fire on defiled altars. The blue ridge of\r\n      the Alban Mount lifts itself against a solemn space of green,\r\n      clear, quiet sky. Watch-towers of dark clouds stand steadfastly\r\n      along the promontories of the Apennines. From the plain to\r\n      the mountains the shattered aqueducts, pier beyond pier, melt\r\n      into darkness, like shadowy and countless troops of funeral\r\n      mourners, passing from a nation's grave. Let us, with Claude,\r\n      make a few 'ideal' alterations in this landscape. First, we\r\n      will reduce the multitudinous precipices of the Apennines to\r\n      four sugar loaves. Secondly, we will remove the Alban Mount,\r\n      and put a large dust-heap in its stead. Next we will knock\r\n      down the greater part of the aqueducts, and leave only an\r\n      arch or two, that their infinity of length may no longer be\r\n      painful from its monotony. For the purple mist and declining\r\n      sun, we will substitute a bright blue sky, with round white\r\n      clouds. Finally, we will get rid of the unpleasant ruins in the\r\n      foreground; we will plant some handsome trees therein, we will\r\n      send for some fiddlers, and get up a dance, and a picnic party.\r\n      It will be found, throughout the picture, that the same species\r\n      of improvement is made on the materials which Claude had ready\r\n      to his hand. The descending slopes of the city of Rome, towards\r\n      the pyramid of Caius Cestius, supply not only lines of the most\r\n      exquisite variety and beauty, but matter for contemplation and\r\n      reflection in every fragment of their buildings. This passage\r\n      has been idealised by Claude into a set of similar round\r\n      towers, respecting which no idea can be formed but that they\r\n      are uninhabitable, and to which no interest can be attached\r\n      beyond the difficulty of conjecturing what they could have been\r\n      built for. The ruins of the temple are rendered unimpressive\r\n      by the juxtaposition of the watermill, and inexplicable by the\r\n      introduction of the Roman soldiers. The glide of the muddy\r\n      streams of the melancholy Tiber and Anio through the Campagna\r\n      is impressive in itself, but altogether ceases to be so when\r\n      we disturb their stillness of motion by a weir, adorn their\r\n      neglected flow with a handsome bridge, and cover their solitary\r\n      surface with punts, nets, and fishermen\" (_Modern Painters_,\r\n      vol i., preface to second edition, pp. xxxvi.-xxxix.)\r\n\r\nTake next the \"ideas of truth\" in the picture--the perception, that is\r\nto say, of faithfulness in a statement of facts by the thing produced.\r\nAnd first (1) for truth of _colour_. \"Can it be seriously supposed\r\nthat those murky browns and melancholy greens are representative of\r\nthe tints of leaves under full noonday sun? I know that you cannot\r\nhelp looking upon all these pictures as pieces of dark relief against\r\na light wholly proceeding from the distances; but they are nothing\r\nof the kind, they are noon and morning effects with full lateral\r\nlight. Be so kind as to match the colour of a leaf in the sun (the\r\ndarkest you like) as nearly as you can, and bring your matched colour\r\nand set it beside one of these groups of trees, and take a blade of\r\ncommon grass, and set it beside any part of the fullest light of\r\ntheir foregrounds, and then talk about the truth of colour of the old\r\nmasters!\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. ii. § 5).\r\n(2) Next for truth of _chiaroscuro_. Claude neglects that distinctness\r\nof shadow which is the chief means of expressing vividness of light.\r\nThus \"the trunks of the trees between the water-wheel and the white\r\nfigure of the middle distance, are dark and visible; but their shadows\r\nare scarcely discernible on the ground, and are quite vague and lost in\r\nthe building. In nature, every bit of the shadow, both on the ground\r\nand building, would have been defined and conspicuous; while the trunks\r\nthemselves would have been faint, confused, and indistinguishable, in\r\ntheir illumined parts,[48] from the grass or distance\" (_ibid._, ch.\r\niii. § 4). (3) Thirdly, for truth of _space_. In nature everything is\r\nindistinct, but nothing vacant. But look at the city on the right bank\r\nof the river:--\r\n\r\n      \"I have seen many cities in my life, and drawn not a few; and\r\n      I have seen many fortifications, fancy ones included, which\r\n      frequently supply us with very new ideas indeed, especially in\r\n      matters of proportion; but I do not remember ever having met\r\n      with either a city or a fortress _entirely_ composed of round\r\n      towers of various heights and sizes, all facsimiles of each\r\n      other, and absolutely agreeing in the number of battlements.\r\n      I have, indeed, some faint recollection of having delineated\r\n      such a one in the first page of a spelling book when I was four\r\n      years old; but, somehow or other, the dignity and perfection\r\n      of the ideal were not appreciated, and the volume was not\r\n      considered to be increased in value by the frontispiece.\r\n      Without, however, venturing to doubt the entire sublimity\r\n      of the same ideal as it occurs in Claude, let us consider\r\n      how nature, if she had been fortunate enough to originate so\r\n      perfect a conception, would have managed it in its details.\r\n      Claude has permitted us to see every battlement, and the first\r\n      impulse we feel upon looking at the picture is to count how\r\n      many there are. Nature would have given us a peculiar confused\r\n      roughness of the upper lines, a multitude of intersections\r\n      and spots, which we should have known from experience was\r\n      indicative of battlements, but which we might as well have\r\n      thought of creating as of counting. Claude has given you the\r\n      walls below in one dead void of uniform gray. There is nothing\r\n      to be seen or felt, or guessed at in it; it is gray paint or\r\n      gray shade, whichever you may choose to call it, but it is\r\n      nothing more. Nature would have let you see, nay, would have\r\n      compelled you to see, thousands of spots or lines, not one\r\n      to be absolutely understood or accounted for, but yet all\r\n      characteristic and different from each other; breaking lights\r\n      on shattered stones, vague shadows from waving vegetation,\r\n      irregular stains of time and weather, mouldering hollows,\r\n      sparkling casements: all would have been there; none indeed\r\n      seen as such, none comprehensible or like themselves, but all\r\n      visible; little shadows and sparkles, and scratches, making\r\n      that whole space of colour a transparent, palpitating, various\r\n      infinity\"[49] (_ibid._, ch. v. § 7).\r\n\r\n(4) Lastly, the picture entirely ignores truth of _mountains_. And\r\nthis in two ways. First, there is a total want of magnitude and aerial\r\ndistance:--\r\n\r\n      \"In the distance is something white, which I believe must be\r\n      intended for a snowy mountain, because I do not see that it\r\n      can well be intended for anything else. Now no mountain of\r\n      elevation sufficient to be sheeted with perpetual snow can by\r\n      any possibility sink so low on the horizon as this something of\r\n      Claude's, unless it be at a distance of from fifty to seventy\r\n      miles. At such distances ... the mountains rise from the\r\n      horizon like transparent films, only distinguishable from mist\r\n      by their excessively keen edges and their brilliant flashes\r\n      of sudden light; they are as unsubstantial as the air itself,\r\n      and impress their enormous size by means of this aerial-ness,\r\n      in a far greater degree at these vast distances, than even\r\n      when towering above the spectator's head.[50] Now, I ask of\r\n      the candid observer if there be the smallest vestige of an\r\n      effort to attain, if there be the most miserable, the most\r\n      contemptible, shadow of attainment of such an effect by Claude?\r\n      Does that white thing on the horizon look seventy miles off?\r\n      Is it faint or fading, or to be looked for by the eye before\r\n      it can be found out? Does it look high? Does it look large?\r\n      Does it look impressive? You cannot but feel that there is not\r\n      a vestige of any kind or species of truth in that horizon; and\r\n      that however artistical it may be, as giving brilliancy to the\r\n      distance (though as far as I have any feeling in the matter\r\n      it only gives coldness), it is, in the very branch of art on\r\n      which Claude's reputation chiefly rests, aerial perspective,\r\n      hurling defiance to nature in her very teeth. But there are\r\n      worse failures in this unlucky distance.... No mountain was\r\n      ever raised to the level of perpetual snow without an infinite\r\n      multiplicity of form. Its foundation is built of a hundred\r\n      minor mountains, and from these, great buttresses run in\r\n      converging ridges to the central peak.... Consequently, in\r\n      distant effect, when chains of such peaks are visible at once,\r\n      the multiplicity of form is absolutely oceanic; and though\r\n      it is possible in near scenes to find vast and simple masses\r\n      composed of lines which run unbroken for a thousand feet or\r\n      more, it is physically impossible when these masses are thrown\r\n      seventy miles back to have simple outlines, for then these\r\n      large features become mere jags and hillocks, and are heaped\r\n      and huddled together in endless confusion.... Hence these\r\n      mountains of Claude having no indication of the steep vertical\r\n      summits which are characteristic of the central ridges, having\r\n      soft edges instead of decisive ones, simple forms instead of\r\n      varied and broken ones, and being painted with a crude raw\r\n      white, having no transparency, nor filminess, nor air in it,\r\n      instead of rising in the opalescent mystery which invariably\r\n      characterises the distant snows, have the forms and the colours\r\n      of heaps of chalk in a limekiln, not of Alps\" (_ibid._, sec.\r\n      iv. ch. ii. §§ 8, 9).\r\n\r\n\r\n13. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Murillo_ (Spanish: 1618-1682).\r\n\r\n      Bartolomé Estéban Murillo, the most widely popular of the\r\n      Spanish painters, was himself sprung from the \"people.\" He was\r\n      born of humble parents in Seville, and his earliest attempts\r\n      at art were pictures for fairs. He is also believed to have\r\n      supplied some of the Madonnas which were shipped off by loads\r\n      for the convents in Mexico[51] and Peru. A turning-point in\r\n      his artistic career came, however, when a certain Pedro de\r\n      Moya came into the studio of Murillo's uncle, Castillo. De\r\n      Moya had been studying under Van Dyck in London. Van Dyck's\r\n      style was a revelation to Murillo, who determined forthwith to\r\n      start off on the grand tour. First, however, he went to Madrid,\r\n      where Velazquez helped him greatly. His studies there were\r\n      so successful, and his popularity became so great, that the\r\n      foreign journey was abandoned. He married a lady of fortune,\r\n      his house became a centre of taste and fashion, commissions\r\n      poured in upon him, and in 1660 he formed the Academy of\r\n      Seville. His life was as pious as it was busy. He was often\r\n      seen praying for long hours in his parish church, and in his\r\n      last illness (which was brought on by his falling, in a fit of\r\n      absence of mind, from a scaffold) he was carried every day to\r\n      pray before Pedro Campaña's \"Descent from the Cross.\" \"I wait\r\n      here,\" he said to the sacristan who asked one day if he were\r\n      ready to go, \"till the pious servants of our Lord have taken\r\n      him down.\"\r\n\r\n      Murillo was thus one of the last sincerely religious\r\n      painters--a class which, \"after a few pale rays of fading\r\n      sanctity from Guido, and brown gleams of gipsy Madonnahood\r\n      from Murillo, came utterly to an end\" (_Modern Painters_, vol.\r\n      v. pt. ix. ch. iv. § 4). But it was \"_gipsy_ Madonnahood\":\r\n      there is an entire want of elevation in his religious types,\r\n      and the peasants whom he painted as beggars or flower-girls\r\n      he painted also as angels or Virgins. This mingling of the\r\n      common with the religious alike in subject and treatment was\r\n      no doubt a principal reason of his great popularity in his own\r\n      country.[52] His vulgarity of treatment in his favourite beggar\r\n      subjects is best seen in the Dulwich Gallery; of his religious\r\n      style, the pictures here are characteristic examples. There is\r\n      a certain \"sweetness\" and sentimentality about them which often\r\n      makes them immensely popular. The French in particular are\r\n      subject to a _furore_ for Murillo, his \"Immaculate Conception,\"\r\n      now in the Louvre, having been bought in 1852 for £23,440--the\r\n      largest sum ever given up to that time for a single\r\n      picture.[53] With children, too, Murillo is nearly always a\r\n      great favourite. A maturer taste, however, finds the sentiment\r\n      of Murillo overcharged, and the sweetness of expression an\r\n      insufficient substitute for elevation of character. \"His\r\n      drawing,\" says Ruskin, \"is free and not ungraceful, but most\r\n      imperfect and slurred to give a melting quality of colour. That\r\n      colour is agreeable because it has no force or severity; but\r\n      it is morbid, sunless, and untrue. His expression is sweet,\r\n      but shallow; his models amiable, but vulgar and mindless; his\r\n      chiaroscuro commonplace, opaque, and conventional; and yet all\r\n      this is so agreeably combined, and animated by a species of\r\n      wax-work life, that it is sure to catch everybody who has not\r\n      either very high feeling or strong love of truth, and to keep\r\n      them from obtaining either\" (Letter to Dean Liddell, given in\r\n      the _Memoir_ by H. L. Thompson, p, 224.)[54] \"Murillo,\" says\r\n      a more appreciative critic, \"who assimilated least of foreign\r\n      elements, had become the most international of all Spanish\r\n      painters; for he possessed the art of winning the favour of\r\n      all, the gift of a language intelligible to all times and\r\n      peoples, to all classes and even to aliens of his faith\"\r\n      (Justi: _Velazquez and his Times_, p. 236). One charm his\r\n      pictures have which no criticism is likely to take away: they\r\n      are all stamped with the artist's individuality; there is never\r\n      any mistaking a Murillo.\r\n\r\nThis picture--known as the Pedroso Murillo, from the Pedroso family,\r\nin whose possession it remained until 1810--is one of the painter's\r\nlast works, painted when he was about sixty. The look of childlike\r\ninnocence in the head of the young Christ is very attractive, although\r\nthe attitude is undeniably \"stagey.\" The heads of the Virgin and St.\r\nJoseph also are good instances of Murillo's plan of \"supplying the\r\nplace of intrinsic elevation by a dramatic exhibition of sentiment\"\r\n(W. B. Scott). The picture is characteristic of what is known as\r\nMurillo's third, or _vaporoso_, manner. His first manner is called\r\n_frio_, or cold; his second warm, or _calido_, and the third, from its\r\nmelting softness, _vaporoso_. The first style is generally spoken of\r\nas lasting up to 1648, the second up to 1656, but he did not so much\r\npaint in these different manners at different times as adapt them to\r\nthe different subjects severally in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. SEAPORT: THE QUEEN OF SHEBA.\r\n\r\n  _Claude_ (French, 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\nThis seaport--inscribed in the right corner _La Reine de Saba va\r\ntrouver Salamon_,--is one of Claude's masterpieces. Like its companion,\r\nthe picture was painted in 1648 for the Duke of Bouillon. \"The\r\nspectator,\" says Sir Edward Poynter, \"may almost imagine that he feels\r\nthe freshness of the early morning, and the breeze which sends the\r\ncrisp waves rolling in from the open sea, while the limpid purity of\r\nthe sunlit atmosphere and the sparkle of the sun on the water, not\r\nonly invite sympathy with the more exquisite aspects of nature, which\r\nis, perhaps, the highest achievement of this art, but are expressed\r\nwith a simplicity and perfection of execution which surpass all the\r\nworks of other painters in which similar effects have been attempted\"\r\n(_The National Gallery_, i. 192). The picture which Turner selected to\r\nvie with this is not one of his best, but Ruskin makes a point out of\r\nClaude's poverty of invention in the details. The queen is starting for\r\na distant expedition, and was going in great state (she went \"with a\r\nvery great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance,\r\nand precious stones\"); yet the prominent incident in the picture is the\r\ncarrying of one schoolgirl's trunk. She is going by sea, and is setting\r\nout in the early morning (for the sun is represented only a little\r\nabove the horizon);[55] yet has no wraps, nor even a head-dress. For\r\nthe rest, Ruskin notices the tameness of Claude's waves and a certain\r\nconventionality in his treatment of ships and seaports generally. \"A\r\nman accustomed to the broad, wild sea-shore, with its bright breakers,\r\nand free winds, and sounding rocks, and eternal sensation of tameless\r\npower, can scarcely but be angered when Claude bids him stand still on\r\nsome paltry chipped and chiselled quay, with porters and wheel-barrows\r\nrunning against him, to watch a weak, rippling, bound and barriered\r\nwater, that has not strength enough in one of its waves to upset the\r\nflower-pots on the wall, or even to fling one jet of spray over the\r\nconfining stone\"[56] (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i.\r\nch. vii. § 5). Claude's ships, too, and his conception of seaports\r\ngenerally, show a strange want of true imagination:\r\n\r\n      \"His ships, having hulls of a shape something between a\r\n      cocoanut and a high-heeled shoe, balanced on their keels on\r\n      the top of the water, with some scaffolding and cross-sticks\r\n      above, and a flag at the top of every stick, form perhaps the\r\n      _purest_ exhibition of human inanity and fatuity which the arts\r\n      have yet produced. The harbours also, in which these model\r\n      navies ride, are worthy of all observation for the intensity\r\n      of the false taste which, endeavouring to unite in them the\r\n      characters of pleasure-ground and port, destroys the veracity\r\n      of both. There are many inlets of the Italian seas where sweet\r\n      gardens and regular terraces descend to the water's edge; but\r\n      these are not the spots where merchant vessels anchor, or where\r\n      bales are disembarked. On the other hand, there are many busy\r\n      quays and noisy arsenals upon the shores of Italy; but queens'\r\n      palaces are not built upon the quays, nor are the docks in any\r\n      wise adorned with conservatories or ruins. It was reserved\r\n      for the genius of Claude to combine the luxurious with the\r\n      lucrative, and rise to a commercial ideal, in which cables are\r\n      fastened to temple pillars, and lighthouses adorned with rows\r\n      of bean-pots\" (_Harbours of England_, pp. 17, 18). Notice,\r\n      lastly, the \"atrocious error in ordinary perspective\" in the\r\n      quay on the left of which the figure is sitting with his hand\r\n      at his eyes[57] (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. i. sec. i. ch.\r\n      v. § 5, pt. ii. sec. vi. ch. ii. § 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n15. ECCE HOMO!\r\n\r\n  _Correggio_ (Parmese: 1494-1534). _See under_ 10.\r\n\r\n\"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple\r\nrobe. And Pilate saith unto them, _Behold the Man!_\"--_Ecce Homo!_\r\n(John xix. 5). Over the domain of tragedy Correggio--with his pretty\r\ngrace and sentimentality--had little sway. In this respect he has\r\nbeen called \"the Rossini of painting. The melodies of the _Stabat\r\nMater_ are the exact analogues in music of Correggio's voluptuous\r\nrenderings of grave or mysterious motives\" (Symonds: _Renaissance_,\r\niii. 248). Thus here it is rather a not-unpleasant feeling of grief\r\nthan any profound sense of sorrow or resignation that the painter\r\nexpresses; but within these limits the picture is a very effective\r\none. \"The features of Christ express pain without being in the least\r\ndisfigured by it. How striking is the holding out of the fettered\r\nhands, as if to say, 'Behold, these are bound for you!' The Virgin\r\nMary, who, in order to see her son, has held by the balustrade which\r\nseparates him from her, sinks with grief into the arms of Mary\r\nMagdalene. Her lips still seem to tremble, but the corners of the mouth\r\nare already fixed, it is involuntarily open; the arched eyelids are on\r\nthe point of covering the closing eyes; the hands with which she has\r\nheld fast let go the balustrade\" (Waagen: _Treasures of Art in Great\r\nBritain_, i. 327). To the right is a Roman soldier, robust and rugged,\r\nyet with a touch of pity in his look; whilst to the left, standing just\r\nwithin the judgment hall, is Pilate, the Roman proconsul, with a mild\r\nlook of self-satisfaction on his face--as of the man who \"washed his\r\nhands\" of the affair and left the populace to do with Christ as they\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nThis picture (which is supposed to have been painted in 1521)\r\nwas formerly in the possession of the Counts Prati of Parma, and\r\nsubsequently in the Colonna Palace at Rome. It was purchased of the\r\nColonna family by Sir Simon Clarke, who, finding it impossible to\r\ntake it out of Italy, sold it to Murat, then King of Naples. It was\r\npurchased, as already related, with No. 10 by Lord Londonderry in 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON.\r\n\r\n  _Tintoretto_ (Venetian: 1518-1594).\r\n\r\n      Jacopo Robusti, called Tintoretto (the little dyer), from the\r\n      trade of his father, is the last great master of the Venetian\r\n      School and \"the most imaginative of all painters.\" His artistic\r\n      ambition was expressed in the line which he wrote on the wall\r\n      of his studio: \"The design of Michelangelo and the colouring of\r\n      Titian.\" He engrafted (says Symonds) on the calm and natural\r\n      Venetian manner \"something of the Michelangelesque sublimity,\r\n      and sought to sway by dramatic movement the romantic motives\r\n      of the school.\" He conquers Michelangelo (says Ruskin) in\r\n      his own field; \"out-flies him in motion, outnumbers him in\r\n      multitude, outwits him in fancy and out-flames him in rage.\"\r\n      The imagination of Tintoret dwelt among the tragic and\r\n      dramatic scenes in sacred history. While he conceived of these\r\n      in the largest and most audacious spirit, his \"imagination\r\n      penetrative\" extended to the minutest details, and his great\r\n      works abound in those minor episodes which lend so much reality\r\n      to a poet's conceptions. In his classical pictures, Tintoret\r\n      combined with the sumptuous colour of Titian something of the\r\n      mythopoeic faculty which enabled him to inspire the tales of\r\n      ancient Greece with an intense vitality of beauty. In other of\r\n      his pictures, effects of light and shade are the vehicle of\r\n      his imagination. It was Tintoret (says Symonds) \"who brought\r\n      to its perfection the poetry of _chiaroscuro_, expressing\r\n      moods of passion and emotion by brusque lights, luminous\r\n      half-shadows, by semi-opaque darkness, no less unmistakably\r\n      than Beethoven by symphonic modulations\" (_Renaissance_, iii.\r\n      270). The intense vitality which characterises Tintoret's\r\n      subject-pictures is conspicuous also in his portraits. They\r\n      \"render the man at his best, full of health and determination,\r\n      and make us look back with amazement to a state where the human\r\n      plant was in such vigour\" (Berenson's _Venetian Painters_,\r\n      p. 59). The picture now before us (16) may give some idea of\r\n      Tintoret's power of imagination; and the decorative piece\r\n      lately added to the Gallery (1313) is exemplary of another\r\n      side of his genius. The Galleries at Hampton Court should also\r\n      be visited by all admirers of Tintoretto. But it is only in\r\n      Venice that this great master can properly be studied, and\r\n      only in the works of Ruskin that any full appreciation of\r\n      his powers is to be found.[58] One or two points, however,\r\n      may profitably be mentioned which visitors who come across\r\n      pictures by Tintoret in foreign galleries should bear in mind.\r\n      First, he is the most unequal in execution of all painters.\r\n      The Venetians used to say he had three pencils--one of gold,\r\n      one of silver, and a third of iron. Annibale Carracci said of\r\n      him that \"if he was sometimes equal to Titian, he was often\r\n      inferior to Tintoretto.\" Secondly, \"when no one would pay for\r\n      his colours (and sometimes nobody would even give him space of\r\n      wall to paint on), he used cheap blue for ultramarine;\" and he\r\n      worked so rapidly, \"and on such large spaces of canvas, that,\r\n      between damp and dry, his colours must go, for the most part.\"\r\n      Tintoret, from the rapidity of his execution, received the\r\n      nickname of _il Furioso_; and Sebastiano del Piombo used to say\r\n      that Tintoret could paint as much in two days as would occupy\r\n      him for two years. Thirdly, Tintoret \"is entirely unconcerned\r\n      respecting the satisfaction of the public. He neither cares to\r\n      display his strength to them, nor convey his ideas to them;\r\n      when he finishes his work, it is, because he is in the humour\r\n      to do so; and the sketch which a meaner painter would have\r\n      left incomplete to show how cleverly it was begun, Tintoret\r\n      simply leaves because he has done as much of it as he likes\"\r\n      (_Relation between Michael Angelo and Tintoret, passim_).\r\n\r\n      The well-founded pride which is thus stamped on Tintoret's art\r\n      is conspicuous in his life. From the first he stood alone. His\r\n      father had sent him as a boy to Titian's studio; but after\r\n      ten days the master dismissed him. From this time forward\r\n      the two men remained upon distant terms,--Tintoretto being\r\n      indeed an ardent admirer of Titian, but never a friend, and\r\n      Titian and his set turning the cold shoulder upon Tintoret.\r\n      The slight passed by Titian upon the young Tintoret threw him\r\n      back upon his own resources, and henceforth he pursued his\r\n      own ideals, self-taught. He bought casts from the antique\r\n      and from the works of Michelangelo; he devoted the day to\r\n      painting, and in the night he made drawings from his casts. His\r\n      persevering labour won for him in time a high position among\r\n      the painters of Venice, and before he was forty he had become\r\n      the acknowledged rival of Titian himself. For some years,\r\n      however, he worked in poverty, often accepting commissions\r\n      without pay, and when he became famous he often worked \"for\r\n      nothing.\" For years he painted in the Scuola di San Rocco--\"a\r\n      shrine reared by Tintoret to his own genius\"--at the rate of\r\n      100 ducats a year. For his \"Paradise\" in the Ducal Palace, \"the\r\n      greatest picture in the world,\" he was asked to name his own\r\n      price, but he left it to the State, and abated something from\r\n      what they tendered. While the commission was still pending,\r\n      Tintoret used to tell the senators that he prayed to God for\r\n      it, so that paradise itself might perchance be his recompense\r\n      after death. His exquisite \"Three Graces\" in the Ducal Palace\r\n      was painted for fifty ducats. He lived aloof from the world,\r\n      seldom leaving Venice. His house, on the Fondamenta de' Mori,\r\n      is still standing, and there are stories told of the way in\r\n      which his wife, the daughter of a Venetian nobleman, tried to\r\n      guard against his unworldliness. When he left the house she\r\n      would wrap up money for him in a handkerchief, and expected\r\n      an account of it on his return. Tintoretto, it is said, had\r\n      always to confess that he had spent it upon alms. He loved all\r\n      the arts, and played the lute and various instruments, some of\r\n      them of his own invention. He designed theatrical costumes,\r\n      and was well versed in mechanics. He abounded in witty sayings,\r\n      but no smile, we are told, ever hovered on his lips. He died at\r\n      the age of seventy-six, leaving as the record of a long life,\r\n      devoted with rare single-mindedness to his art, the remark that\r\n      the art of painting was one which became ever increasingly\r\n      difficult.\r\n\r\nA picture of particular interest in the National Gallery, being a\r\nrepresentation by one of the greatest of artists of the patron saint of\r\nEngland. The fight of St. George with the dragon is familiar to every\r\none, being on the reverse of our gold sovereigns, and in the \"Jubilee\"\r\ncoinage on that of our silver crowns. \"As a piece of mere die-cutting,\r\nthat St. George is one of the best bits of work we have on our money,\"\r\nbut a reference to its absurdities in design will serve admirably to\r\nbring out some of the imaginative merits of this picture. On our coins\r\nSt. George's horse looks abstractedly in the air, instead of where it\r\nwould have looked, at the beast between its legs. Here Tintoret has\r\nadmirably brought out the chivalry of the horse. Knight and charger\r\nare alike intent upon their foe, and note that St. George wears no\r\nspurs: the noble animal nature is attuned to his rider. But, though\r\nun-spurred, St. George is every inch a knight. His whole strength is\r\ngiven in the spear-thrust which is to kill the dragon: compare this\r\nwith St. George on our coins, \"with nothing but his helmet on (being\r\nthe last piece of armour he is likely to want), putting his naked\r\nfeet, at least his feet showing their toes through the buskins, well\r\nforward, that the dragon may with the greatest convenience get a bite\r\nat them; and about to deliver a mortal blow at him with a sword which\r\ncannot reach him by a couple of yards.\" To understand the other touches\r\nof true imagination in Tintoret's picture, it is necessary to recall\r\nthe meaning of the legend of St. George and the Dragon (identical with\r\nthat of Perseus and Andromeda).[59] The dragon represents the evil of\r\nsinful, fleshly passion, the element in our nature which is of the\r\nearth, earthy. Notice with what savage tenacity, therefore, the beast\r\nis made to clutch at the earth. From his mouth he is spitting fire--the\r\nred fire of consuming passion. St. George is the champion of purity;\r\nhe rides therefore on a white horse, white being the typical colour of\r\na blameless life. He wears no helmet--for that might obscure his sight,\r\nand the difficulty in this warfare is not so much to kill your dragon\r\nas to see him. In front of him is the dead body of another man:\r\n\r\n    He gazes on the silent dead\r\n    \"They perished in their daring deeds.\"\r\n    This proverb flashes through his head,\r\n    \"The many fail, the one succeeds.\"\r\n\r\nBehind him is a long castle wall, the towers and battlements perhaps\r\nof some great city. In many pictures of this subject (see _e.g._ 75)\r\nthere are crowds of spectators on the walls, who will cheer the knight\r\nin his struggle and applaud him in his victory. But here the walls\r\nare deserted, and but for the princess in the foreground, there are\r\nno spectators of the struggle: it is one which has to be fought alone\r\nand in secret places. The princess had been given, in the story, as a\r\nsacrifice to the dragon, and St. George, who comes to rescue her, is\r\nthus the type of noble chivalry. \"She turns away for flight; and if her\r\nhands are raised to heaven, and her knees fall to earth, it is more\r\nthat she stumbles in a woman's weakness, than that she abides in faith\r\nor sweet surrender. Tintoret sees the scene as in the first place a\r\nmatter of fact, and paints accordingly, following his judgment of girl\r\nnature.\" But in another sense the princess of the allegory represents\r\nthe soul of man, which has to be freed from subjection to the dragon\r\nof the flesh. And so perhaps Tintoret makes her fly, \"from a certain\r\nascetic feeling, a sense growing with the growing license of Venice,\r\nthat the soul must rather escape from this monster by flight than hope\r\nto see it subdued and made serviceable\" (_St. Mark's Rest_, Second\r\nSupplement, pp. 14, 21, 33; _Fors Clavigera_, 1873, xxv. and xxvi.)\r\n\r\n\r\n17. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea del Sarto_[60] (Florentine: 1486-1531). _See_ 690.\r\n\r\nSt. Elizabeth with her son, the infant John the Baptist, visiting the\r\nMadonna and infant Christ. It is \"a Holy Family,\" but except for the\r\nsymbolical cross of the Baptist and the faint circlet of golden light\r\nsurrounding the Madonna's head, there is no hint of divinity about this\r\npretty domestic scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. CHRIST AND THE PHARISEES.[61]\r\n\r\n  _Bernardino Luini_ (Lombard: about 1475-1533).\r\n\r\n      Bernardino, \"dear little Bernard,\" the son of Giovanni\r\n      Lutero, called Luini from his birthplace Luino, on the Lago\r\n      Maggiore, is perhaps, says Ruskin, \"the best central type of\r\n      the highly-trained Italian painter,\" being \"alone in uniting\r\n      consummate art-power with untainted simplicity of religious\r\n      imagination.\" \"The two elements, poised in perfect balance, are\r\n      so calmed and restrained, each by the other, that most of us\r\n      lose the sense of both.\" Next to nothing is known of his life\r\n      beyond journeys to various places in the lake district--Lugano,\r\n      Legnano, and Saronno, to paint frescoes. \"We have no anecdotes\r\n      of him, only hundreds of noble works. Child of the Alps, and\r\n      of their divinest lake, he is taught, without doubt or dismay,\r\n      a lofty religious creed, and a sufficient law of life, and of\r\n      its mechanical arts. Whether lessoned by Leonardo himself,\r\n      or merely one of many, disciplined in the system of the\r\n      Milanese School, he learns unerringly to draw, unerringly and\r\n      enduringly to paint\" ... \"a mighty colourist, while Leonardo\r\n      was only a fine draughtsman in black, staining the chiaroscuro\r\n      drawing like a coloured print.\" Luini's \"tasks are set him\r\n      without question day by day, by men who are justly satisfied\r\n      with his work, and who accept it without any harmful praise\r\n      or senseless blame. Place, scale, and subject are determined\r\n      for him on the cloister wall or the church dome; as he is\r\n      required, and for sufficient daily bread, and little more,\r\n      he paints what he has been taught to design wisely and has\r\n      passion to realise gloriously: every touch he lays is eternal,\r\n      every thought he conceives is beautiful and pure\" (_Queen of\r\n      the Air_, § 157; _Catalogue of the Educational Series_, p. 43;\r\n      Oxford _Lectures on Art_, §§ 73, 92). This picture, formerly\r\n      ascribed to Leonardo, belongs to Luini's second period, when\r\n      he was under the influence of that master. To his third and\r\n      independent manner belong the frescoes at Milan, Saronno, and\r\n      Lugano, and the three pictures in Como Cathedral (Morelli's\r\n      _Italian Masters in German Galleries_, 1883, pp. 435-438).\r\n      Luini's female figures (says Sir Frederick Burton) \"are full of\r\n      sweetness and gracious dignity; and should we incline to cavil\r\n      at the monotony of his type, its loveliness disarms us. But a\r\n      merit even higher than his sense of beauty is the pathos which\r\n      he infused into subjects that required it. These he imagined\r\n      from within outwards, following his inspiration without egotism\r\n      or mannerism. He appears to most advantage in fresco; for few\r\n      have understood so well as he the management of the limited\r\n      palette of the fresco painter, and that skilful juxtaposition\r\n      of tints by which the value of each is exalted. The decorated\r\n      party-wall and adjacent chapels in S. Maurizio at Milan must\r\n      once have been as conspicuous for their harmonious colouring\r\n      as the former still is for the radiant beauty of the Virgin\r\n      Saints in its lower compartment.\" Copies of several of Luini's\r\n      frescoes are included in the Arundel Society's Collection.\r\n\r\nChrist is arguing with the Pharisees, but he wears the tender\r\nexpression of the man who \"did not strive nor cry, neither was his\r\nvoice heard in the streets.\" The disputant on the extreme right, with\r\nthe close-shaven face and firm-set features, has his hand on a volume\r\nof the Scriptures, and is taking his stand (as it were) on the letter\r\nof the law. The one on the extreme left, on the other hand, is almost\r\npersuaded. In contrast to him is the older man with the white beard,\r\nwho seems to be marvelling at the presumption of youth. The remaining\r\nhead is the type of the fanatic; \"by our law he ought to die.\" This\r\npicture, besides its splendid colouring, is a good instance of that law\r\nof order or symmetry which is characteristic of all perfect art. The\r\ncentral figure faces us; there are two figures on one side, balanced by\r\ntwo on the other; the face in the left corner looks right, that in the\r\nright corner looks left, whilst to break any too obtrusive symmetry the\r\nhead of Christ itself inclines somewhat to the left also. This famous\r\npicture, of which there are several old copies, was formerly in the\r\nAldobrandini apartments in the Borghese Palace at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. NARCISSUS AND ECHO.\r\n\r\n  _Claude_ (French: 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\nNarcissus, a beautiful youth, was beloved by the nymph Echo, but he\r\nspurned her love, and when she pined away she was changed into a stone\r\nwhich still retained the power of voice. But Narcissus, seeing his own\r\nimage reflected in a fountain, became enamoured of it, and when he\r\ncould never reach his phantom love he killed himself for grief, and the\r\nnymphs who came to burn his body found only the \"short-lived flower\"\r\nthat bears his name. Here, half-hidden in the trees, we see the\r\n\r\n    Naiad hid beneath the bank,\r\n      By the willowy river-side,\r\n    Where Narcissus gently sank,\r\n      Where unmarried Echo died.\r\n\r\n  _Ionica._\r\n\r\nThis was one of Sir George Beaumont's Claudes which Constable so much\r\nadmired when he was staying at Coleorton. \"I am now going,\" wrote\r\nConstable to his wife, \"to breakfast before the Narcissus of Claude.\r\nHow enchanting and lovely it is; far, very far surpassing any other\r\nlandscape I ever beheld\" (Leslie's _Life of Constable_, 1845, p. 120).\r\nRuskin, on the other hand, finds fault with some of the details, as\r\nshowing Claude's ignorance of tree structure. \"Take the stem of the\r\nchief tree in Claude's Narcissus. It is a very faithful portrait of a\r\nlarge boa-constrictor with a handsome tail; the kind of trunk which\r\nyoung ladies at fashionable boarding schools represent with nosegays at\r\nthe top of them by way of forest scenery.\" Again, \"Observe the bough\r\nunderneath the first bend of the great stem, ... it sends off four\r\nbranches like the ribs of a leaf. The two lowest of these are both\r\nquite as thick as the parent stem, and the stem itself is much thicker\r\nafter it has sent off the first one than it was before. The top boughs\r\nof the central tree, in the 'Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca' (12),\r\nramify in the same scientific way\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii.\r\nsec. vi. ch. i. §§ 7, 9).\r\n\r\n\r\n20. IPPOLITO DE' MEDICI AND THE ARTIST.\r\n\r\n  _Sebastiano del Piombo_ (Venetian: 1485-1547). _See_ 1.\r\n\r\nIn 1531 Sebastiano received from the Pope the office of Frate del\r\nPiombo, Monk of the Leaden Signet, which was affixed to the pontifical\r\ndiplomas. An entertaining account of Sebastiano's appointment is given\r\nin Benvenuto Cellini's Memoirs (see Symonds's translation, i. 150). The\r\npainter is here dressed in the black robe of his office; on the table\r\nare two parchment-deeds, with Sebastiano's hand on the seal of one of\r\nthem, and the picture thus represents, perhaps, the ratification of the\r\nappointment by his friend and patron, the Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici.\r\nThe artist's portrait of himself agrees very well with what Vasari says\r\nof his character. He was a painter more of necessity than of choice,\r\nand when once he received his valuable sinecure he forsook his palette\r\nfor the lute, and people found it very hard to get any work out of him.\r\nHe much preferred talking about pictures, says Vasari, to executing\r\nthem. He was \"of a very full habit,\" and young painters who resorted to\r\nhim \"rarely made any great profit, since from his example they could\r\nlearn little beside the art of good living.\" But he was a thoroughly\r\ngood fellow, and a kindly withal. A better or more agreeable companion\r\nnever lived; and when he died he commanded that his remains should\r\nbe carried to the tomb without any ceremony of priests and friars,\r\nand that the amount which would have been thus expended should be\r\ndistributed to the poor, for the love of God: and so was it done. But\r\nin one branch of art, adds Vasari, Sebastiano was always ready to work,\r\nnamely, in painting portraits, such as this, from the life. \"In this\r\nart he did certainly surpass all others in delicacy and excellence--so\r\nmuch so that when Cardinal Ippolito fell in love with the lady Giulia\r\nGonzaga, he sent Sebastiano with four swift horses to her home for\r\nthe purpose of taking her portrait, and in about a month the artist\r\ncompleted the likeness, when, what with the celestial beauties of that\r\nlady, and what with the able hand of so accomplished a master, the\r\npicture proved to be a most divine one.\" No. 24 was formerly thought to\r\nbe the portrait in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. PORTRAIT OF A FLORENTINE LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Cristofano Allori_ (Florentine: 1577-1621).\r\n\r\n      An excellent portrait-painter, who painted many of the\r\n      distinguished persons of his time. Of his other works, the best\r\n      known is the \"Judith with the head of Holophernes,\" in the\r\n      Pitti. The Judith \"so beautifully and magnificently attired is\r\n      a portrait of his mistress; while her mother appears in the\r\n      character of Abra, and the head of Holophernes is that of the\r\n      painter, who permitted his beard to grow for this purpose.\"\r\n      He was very fastidious in his execution. \"From this method,\r\n      and from vicious habits that often seduced him from his\r\n      labours, his pictures are rare, and he himself is little known\"\r\n      (Lanzi's _History of Painting_, i. 217). Cristofano was the\r\n      son of Alessandro Allori, a painter of Michelangelo's school.\r\n\r\nNotice the richly embroidered head-dress, resembling in form the\r\nVenetian rolled coif or turban which often occurs in pictures of Titian.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. ANGELS WEEPING OVER THE DEAD CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Guercino_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1591-1666).\r\n\r\n      Giovanni Francesco Barbieri was called Guercino, the\r\n      Squintling, from an accident which distorted his right eye in\r\n      babyhood. He attained to much fame and wealth in his day; but\r\n      was self-taught, and the son of humble parents, his father\r\n      being a wood-carrier, and agreeing to pay for his son's\r\n      education by a load of grain and a vat of grapes delivered\r\n      yearly. As a young man, he settled in Rome, where he became\r\n      acquainted with Caravaggio. He returned to his native town,\r\n      Cento, in 1623, and there founded an academy which was much\r\n      frequented by young painters. In 1642 he removed to Bologna,\r\n      where he died in affluent circumstances in 1666. In art\r\n      history Guercino is interesting as showing the blending of\r\n      the Eclectic style of the Carracci with the Naturalistic\r\n      style of Caravaggio. In the work of his latest, or Bolognese,\r\n      period, \"when he appears to have endeavoured to approximate\r\n      to the style of Guido, he forsook the vigorous handling and\r\n      treatment of his earlier pictures and fell into an insipid\r\n      manner\" (Burton). Guercino (says Symonds) \"lived the life of\r\n      an anchorite, absorbed in studies, reserved, sober, pious,\r\n      truthful, sincere in his commerce with the world, unaffectedly\r\n      virtuous, devoted to his art and God.\" In the motives of\r\n      his picture one sees reflected the Catholic revival of his\r\n      day,--\"the Christianity of the age was not naïve, simple,\r\n      sincere, and popular, but hysterical, dogmatic, hypocritical,\r\n      and sacerdotal. It was not Christianity indeed, but Catholicism\r\n      galvanised by terror into reactionary movement\" (_Renaissance_,\r\n      vii. 232).\r\n\r\nA comparison even of this little picture--in its somewhat morbid\r\nsentiment--with such an one as Crivelli's (602)--with its deeper\r\nbecause simpler feeling--well illustrates the nature of the change.\r\nThis is, however, one of Guercino's best works. It was formerly in the\r\nBorghese Gallery, and Rumohr, in his account of that collection (1784),\r\nnotices it as one of the productions of the painter's best time. \"The\r\nfigure of Christ is admirable in drawing and foreshortening, and\r\npainted with a broad decisive touch in really astonishing relief; while\r\nthe weeping angels, if not of an elevated type, are marked by a real\r\nnaïveté and sincerity of pathos. The wonderful chiaroscuro is here not\r\nonly rich, and well concentrated, too, beyond the painter's wont, but\r\nimpressive, and duly accounted for by the supernatural luminosity of\r\nthe body of Christ\" (_Portfolio_, August 1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n23. \"THE VIRGIN OF THE BASKET.\"\r\n\r\n  _Correggio_ (Parmese: 1494-1534). _See_ 10.\r\n\r\nA celebrated work of the master, and one of the principal treasures of\r\nthe National Gallery--\"a little gem of extraordinary tenderness,\" Mengs\r\ncalls it; and Frizzoni, \"an incomparable marvel of light, vivacity,\r\nand smiling sweetness.\" Alike in sentiment and in technique, it is\r\nvery characteristic. A comparison of it with Raphael's great Madonna\r\nor any of those of the earlier masters (_e.g._ Bellini) will show in\r\na moment wherein the peculiarity of Correggio consists. The mother\r\nhas none of the rapt look of the woman who \"laid these things in her\r\nheart,\" and the child has no prophetic sense of future suffering. There\r\nis nothing to mark the picture as representing the Holy Family except\r\nthe introduction of Joseph, the carpenter, in the background. It is a\r\npicture painted solely in the \"religion of humanity,\" and full only of\r\nartless grace and melodious tenderness. The child is full of play and\r\nfun; the mother (with the household basket which gives the picture its\r\nname--\"La Vierge au panier\") is dressing him, and has just succeeded\r\nin putting his right arm through the sleeve of his little coat, and\r\nis endeavouring by gentle stratagem to do the same with the left;\r\nbut something has caught his fancy, and she shares in his delight,\r\nsmiling with all a young mother's fondness at the waywardness of her\r\ncurly-haired boy. \"As a painting,\" says Sir Edward Poynter, \"it is one\r\nof those masterpieces of perfect technicality, of brilliant purity of\r\nlighting and colouring, and of completeness of modelling in the flesh\r\ntints, combined with the utmost apparent ease of execution, which may\r\nwell be the despair of painters for all time. As a design it is no\r\nless remarkable; for though of studied harmony in the arrangement of\r\nthe forms it is so natural that all appearance of effort is lost, and\r\nwe cannot conceive of the scene as being rendered in a more artless\r\nmanner\" (_The National Gallery_, i. 4).\r\n\r\nThe date of this picture is uncertain. Some, liking to find in it a\r\npiece of the painter's own home-life, have dated it 1521-22, that is\r\njust after the birth of Correggio's first child. Others put it earlier\r\nin the artist's career, 1518. It is perhaps the picture which Vasari\r\ndescribes as in the possession of the Cavaliere Baiardi of Parma--\"a\r\nmarvellous and beautiful work by Correggio, in which Our Lady puts a\r\nlittle shirt on the Infant Christ.\" It was afterwards in the royal\r\ncollection at Madrid, from which it passed by the gift of Charles IV.\r\nto Don Emanuele Goday, at whose instance it was subjected to a most\r\nrigorous cleaning. During the French invasion of Spain it fell into\r\nvarious hands, and in 1825 was bought for the National Gallery from Mr.\r\nC. J. Nieuwenhuys for £3800--a sum, it has been calculated, that would\r\n\"cover the little panel with sovereigns just twenty-seven times over.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n24. AN ITALIAN LADY AS ST. AGATHA.\r\n\r\n  _Sebastiano del Piombo_ (Venetian: 1485-1547). _See_ 1.\r\n\r\nThe nimbus around the head indicates the saint; the palm branch and\r\nthe pincers indicate St. Agatha, who was \"bound and beaten with rods,\r\nand her tender bosom was cruelly torn with iron pincers; and as her\r\nblood flowed forth, she said, 'O thou tyrant! shamest thou not to treat\r\nme so--- thou who hast been nourished and fed from the breast of a\r\nmother?' And this was her only plaint.\" See also under 20.\r\n\r\n\r\n25. ST. JOHN IN THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\n  _Annibale Carracci_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1560-1609). _See_ 9.\r\n\r\n\"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts\r\ntill the day of his shewing unto Israel\" (Luke i. 80). In his left hand\r\nis the standard of the Lamb, the symbol of his mission, for which he\r\nis preparing himself in the desert solitude, while with his right he\r\ncatches water in a cup from a stream in the rocks, symbolical of the\r\nwater by which that mission, the baptism unto repentance, was to be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n26. THE CONSECRATION OF ST. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Veronese_ (Veronese: 1528-1588).\r\n\r\n      Paolo Caliari (called Veronese from his birthplace) stands,\r\n      says Ruskin, in the forefront of the great colourists. \"Titian,\r\n      Veronese, and Tintoret were the only painters who ever sought\r\n      entirely to master, and who did entirely master, the truths of\r\n      light and shade as associated with colour, in the noblest of\r\n      all physical created things, the human form.\" With Veronese,\r\n      \"the whole picture is like the rose--glowing with colour in\r\n      the shadows, and rising into paler and more delicate hues, or\r\n      masses of whiteness, in the lights.\" Contrasting the aims of\r\n      Veronese with those of the great chiaroscurists, Ruskin says:\r\n      \"Veronese chooses to represent the great relations of visible\r\n      things to each other, to the heaven above, and to the earth\r\n      beneath them. He holds it more important to show how a figure\r\n      stands relieved from delicate air, or marble wall; how as a\r\n      red, or purple, or white figure, it separates itself, in clear\r\n      discernibility, from things not red, nor purple, nor white;\r\n      how infinite daylight shines round it; how innumerable veils\r\n      of faint shadow invest it; how its blackness and darkness\r\n      are, in the excess of their nature, just as limited and local\r\n      as its intensity of light; all this, I say, he feels to be\r\n      more important than showing merely the exact _measure_ of the\r\n      spark of sunshine that gleams on a dagger-hilt, or glows on a\r\n      jewel. All this, moreover, he feels to be harmonious,--capable\r\n      of being joined in one great system of spacious truth. And\r\n      with inevitable watchfulness, inestimable subtlety, he unites\r\n      all this in tenderest balance, noting in each hair's-breadth\r\n      of colour, not merely what its rightness or wrongness is\r\n      in itself, but what its relation is to every other on his\r\n      canvas.\" In the tone of his colouring Paolo retained, as Sir\r\n      F. Burton points out, much of the tradition of the Veronese\r\n      school. \"The silvery tone which differentiates his best works\r\n      from the golden lustre of Titian was not gained in Venice, and\r\n      under the lightsome skies of the lagoons he was not tempted\r\n      to alter it.\" In the tone of his mind Veronese was thoroughly\r\n      Venetian. It is a certain \"gay grasp of the outside aspects of\r\n      the world\" that distinguishes him. \"By habitual preference,\r\n      exquisitely graceful and playful; religious, without severity,\r\n      and winningly noble; delighting in slight, sweet everyday\r\n      incident, but hiding deep meanings underneath it; rarely\r\n      painting a gloomy subject, and never a base one\" (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. iii. § 16; vol. iv. pt. v.\r\n      ch. iii. § 18, ch. xx. § 16; vol. v. pt. ix. ch. iii. § 27;\r\n      _Cambridge Inaugural Lecture in O.O.R._, vol. i. § 314). Thus\r\n      Venetian in character, it is the Venice of his time--with all\r\n      its material magnificence and pride of life of a nation of\r\n      merchant princes--that Veronese everywhere paints. \"Veronese,\"\r\n      says Symonds, \"elevated pageantry to the height of serious art.\r\n      His domain is noonday sunlight ablaze on sumptuous dresses and\r\n      Palladian architecture. Armour, shot silks and satins, brocaded\r\n      canopies, banners, plate, fruit, sceptres, crowns--all things,\r\n      in fact, that burn and glitter in the sun--form the habitual\r\n      furniture of his pictures.\" It is characteristic of the spirit\r\n      of his time that the pictures by Veronese of banquets and\r\n      other scenes of gaiety were mostly painted for monasteries.\r\n      The frank introduction of the costumes of the painter's own\r\n      time, clothing the fine race to which he belonged, gives to\r\n      his pictures of this kind an historical interest. Often he\r\n      introduces portraits into his groups. In expression his\r\n      figures are often deficient. \"He will make the Magdalene wash\r\n      the feet of Christ with a countenance as absolutely unmoved as\r\n      that of any ordinary servant bringing an ewer to her master.\"\r\n      Animal force in men, superb voluptuousness in women, were\r\n      his favourite types. \"His noblest creatures are men of about\r\n      twenty-five, manly, brawny, crisp-haired, full of nerve and\r\n      blood. In all this Veronese resembles Rubens. But he does not,\r\n      like Rubens, strike us as gross, sensual, fleshly; he remains\r\n      proud and powerful, and frigidly urbane. The same love of\r\n      display led him to delight in allegory--not allegory of the\r\n      deep and mystic kind, but of the pompous and processional, in\r\n      which Venice appears enthroned among the deities, or the genii\r\n      of the arts are personified as handsome women and blooming\r\n      boys.\" He painted with marvellous facility and revelled, as we\r\n      have seen, in exuberance. In this he resembled Rubens, but he\r\n      combined, as Rubens did not, moderation with profusion. Amid\r\n      so much that is distracting, Veronese never loses command over\r\n      his subject or his brush, \"restraining, for truth's sake, his\r\n      exhaustless energy; reining back, for truth's sake, his fiery\r\n      strength; veiling, before truth, the vanity of brightness;\r\n      penetrating, for truth, the discouragement of gloom; ruling his\r\n      restless invention with a rod of iron; pardoning no error, no\r\n      thoughtlessness, no forgetfulness; and subduing all his powers,\r\n      impulses, and imaginations, to the arbitrament of a merciless\r\n      justice, and the obedience of an incorruptible verity.\"\r\n\r\n      Of the life of Paolo Veronese few incidents are related. He\r\n      was the son of a stone carver, and having shown a propensity\r\n      to painting was apprenticed to his uncle, a mediocre artist.\r\n      In his native city the works of Cavazzola and other Veronese\r\n      masters were before his eyes. After executing some commissions\r\n      in Mantua and Verona, he went in 1555 to Venice, which was\r\n      henceforward to be his home and the scene of his triumphs.\r\n      He soon began to rank with Tintoretto, who was nearly twenty\r\n      years his senior, and with Titian, then in his eightieth year.\r\n      He entered into a competition for painting the ceiling of the\r\n      library of St. Mark, and executed the commission with so much\r\n      power that his very rivals voted him the golden chain which had\r\n      been tendered as an honorary distinction. He visited Verona in\r\n      1565, where he then married the daughter of his old master;\r\n      and in 1560-61 he went to Rome in the suite of Grimani, the\r\n      Venetian ambassador. With these exceptions he remained in\r\n      Venice, full of work and honour. Upon his death his two sons\r\n      and his younger brother, Benedetto, continued the work of his\r\n      studio, signing the works which they produced in common as\r\n      \"heirs of Paolo Caliari Veronese.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture, which was formerly in the church of San Niccolo de' Frari\r\nat Venice, represents the consecration of Nicholas (for whom see 1171)\r\nas Bishop of Myra, in Syria (hence the turbans of the attendants). Two\r\ndignitaries of the Church are presenting him to the patriarch, who\r\nholds aloft the symbolical cross of the Redeemer, and with his right\r\nhand gives his blessing. The bishop-elect abases himself meanwhile\r\nthat he may be exalted, while the angel descending with the mitre and\r\ncrozier signifies that his \"call\" is from above. Clearly it is the\r\npageantry of a Church function that fascinates the painter. \"His art\r\nis seen at its best,\" says Sir Edward Poynter, \"in the grouping and\r\nlight and shade in this picture. The boy kneeling on the right is a\r\nmasterpiece of silvery colour, and, with his red stockings, gives\r\nvivacity to the whole composition.\" We may also observe in this picture\r\nthe employment of a \"glaze.\" \"The kneeling figure of the Saint is robed\r\nin green, with sleeves of golden orange. This latter colour is carried\r\nthrough as under-painting over the whole draped portions of the figure,\r\nthe green being then floated over and so manipulated that the golden\r\ntint shows through in parts and gives the high lights on the folds\"\r\n(Baldwin Brown's _Fine Arts_, 1891, p. 310).\r\n\r\n\r\n27. THE POPE JULIUS II.\r\n\r\n  _Raphael_ (Urbino: 1483-1520). _See_ 1171.\r\n\r\n      This is one of nine replicas, or contemporary copies, of the\r\n      portrait in the Uffizi at Florence. Julius died in 1513; the\r\n      portrait belongs, therefore, to the earlier part of Raphael's\r\n      Roman period.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of a Pope of the church militant. \"Raphael has caught\r\nthe momentary repose of a restless and passionate spirit, and has\r\nshown all the grace and beauty which are to be found in the sense of\r\npower repressed and power at rest. Seated in an arm-chair, with head\r\nbent downward, the Pope is in deep thought. His furrowed brow and his\r\ndeep-sunk eyes tell of energy and decision. The down-drawn corners\r\nof his mouth betoken constant dealings with the world\" (Creighton's\r\n_History of the Papacy_). For it was in the temporal, not in the\r\nspiritual world that Julius lived and moved and had his being, and\r\nbecame, by his combination of military and diplomatic abilities, the\r\nmost prominent political figure of his day. But, like other great\r\nprinces of the time, Julius was a liberal and enlightened patron of\r\nthe arts: it was he who laid the foundation-stone of St. Peter's,\r\nand who called Michael Angelo and Raphael to his court. On the green\r\nhanging which forms the background, the cross-keys of the pontifical\r\noffice are indicated, and from the two corners of the back of the\r\nchair rise two shafts, surmounted by gilt ornaments in the form of\r\nacorns--in reference to the armorial bearings of the Pope's family\r\n(_della Rovere_). \"No amount of elaboration in the background could\r\ndisturb the attention of any one looking at the portrait of Julius the\r\nSecond, by Raphael, also in the Tribune, which I cannot help thinking\r\nis _the_ finished portrait in the world. A portrait is _the most truly\r\nhistorical picture_, and this is the most monumental and historical of\r\nportraits. The longer one looks at it the more it demands attention. A\r\nsuperficial picture is like a superficial character--it may do for an\r\nacquaintance, but not for a friend. One never gets to the end of things\r\nto interest and admire in many old portrait-pictures\" (G. F. Watts,\r\nR.A., in the _Magazine of Art_, January 1889).\r\n\r\n\r\n28. SUSANNAH AND THE ELDERS.\r\n\r\n  _Lodovico Carracci_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1555-1619).\r\n\r\n      Lodovico is famous in art history as the founder of the\r\n      Eclectic school of Bologna. Disgusted with the weakness of the\r\n      Mannerists (of whom Baroccio was the best; _see_ next picture),\r\n      he determined to start a rival school, and enlisted the\r\n      services of his two cousins, Agostino and Annibale, for that\r\n      purpose. Their object, as expressed in a sonnet by Agostino,\r\n      was to be to \"acquire the design of Rome, Venetian action, and\r\n      Venetian management of shade, the dignified colour of Lombardy\r\n      (Leonardo), the terrible manner of Michael Angelo, Titian's\r\n      truth and nature, the sovereign purity of Correggio's style,\r\n      and the just symmetry of Raphael.\" Lodovico, who was the son\r\n      of a Bolognese butcher,[62] was a man of very wide culture and\r\n      of great industry. In natural talent he was deficient. When\r\n      first sent to an art school at Bologna, he was called by his\r\n      companions \"the ox,\" and when he visited Venice the veteran\r\n      Tintoretto warned him that he had no vocation. But resolving\r\n      to win by industry what nature seemed to have denied him, he\r\n      studied diligently at Florence, Parma, Mantua, and Venice. He\r\n      superintended the school, at first conjointly with his cousins,\r\n      afterwards alone, from 1589 to his death.\r\n\r\nA less objectionable rendering than most, of the story of Susannah in\r\nthe Apocrypha--a story for all time, setting forth as it does the way\r\nin which minions of the law too often prey upon the innocent, and the\r\nrighteous condemnation that the people, when there are just judges in\r\nthe land, mete out to the offenders. Two judges, \"ancients of the\r\npeople,\" approached Susannah and threatened to report her as guilty\r\nunless she consented to do their bidding. She refused, and was reported\r\naccordingly. Judgment had well-nigh gone against her, when Daniel arose\r\nto convict the elders of false-witness, and they were straightway put\r\nto death. It is the moment of Susannah's temptation that the artist\r\nhere depicts. \"It is,\" says Hazlitt (p. 5), \"as if the young Jewish\r\nbeauty had been just surprised in that unguarded spot--crouching down\r\nin one corner of the picture, the face turned back with a mingled\r\nexpression of terror, shame, and unconquerable sweetness, and the whole\r\nfigure, with the arms crossed, shrinking into itself with bewitching\r\ngrace and modesty.\" But Hazlitt never took notes, and Susannah's arms\r\nare not crossed--nor is her expression quite so naïve as he describes.\r\n\r\n\r\n29. \"OUR LADY OF THE CAT.\"\r\n\r\n  _Baroccio_ (Umbrian: 1528-1612).\r\n\r\n      Federigo Barocci, or Baroccio, is the best of the \"Mannerists.\"\r\n      \"He feebly continued the style of Correggio,\" says Symonds,\r\n      \"with a certain hectic originality, infusing sentimental\r\n      pietism into that great master's pagan sensuousness\"\r\n      (_Renaissance_, viii. 211). His colouring is peculiar: he used\r\n      too much vermilion and ultramarine, and too few yellows. He was\r\n      a native of Urbino, and the son of a sculptor. In 1548 he went\r\n      to Rome and remained there some years, devoting his time to the\r\n      study of Raphael. He then returned to Urbino, again visiting\r\n      Rome in 1560, when he was employed in the Vatican. While there\r\n      he was nearly poisoned, by some rival it is supposed, and for\r\n      the rest of his long life he suffered from disease of the\r\n      stomach, which rendered him unable to do much work. He died at\r\n      Urbino at the age of eighty-four.\r\n\r\nAn admirable example of the decline of Italian art. The old religious\r\nspirit has entirely vanished, and the Holy Family is represented\r\nas worrying a bird with a cat! John the Baptist holds the little\r\ngoldfinch; while the Madonna expressly directs the attention of the\r\ninfant Christ to the fun. \"See, the cat is trying to get at it,\" she\r\nseems to say. Behind the bird, the painter, in unconscious irony,\r\nhas placed the Cross. The visitor who wishes to see how far Italian\r\nart has travelled in a hundred years should compare this picture\r\nwith such an one as Bellini's (280), or with one of Raphael's, of\r\nwhom Baroccio was a fellow-countryman. The connecting link should\r\nthen be seen in Correggio (23). With Bellini or Perugino, the motive\r\nis wholly religious. With Raphael it is intermingled with artistic\r\ndisplay. Correggio brings heaven wholly down to earth, but yet paints\r\nhis domestic scene with lovely grace. Baroccio brings, one may almost\r\nsay, heaven down to hell,[63] and uses all his skill to show the infant\r\nSaviour's pleasure in teasing a bird. But the artist only embodied the\r\nspirit of his time. Baroccio was one of the most celebrated painters of\r\nhis day, and his biographer (Bellori) writes of him that \"his pencil\r\nmay be said to have been dedicated to religion: so devout, so tender,\r\nand so calculated to awaken feelings of piety, are the sentiments\r\nexpressed in his pictures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n30. SEAPORT: ST. URSULA.\r\n\r\n  _Claude_ (French: 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\nThe best Claude in the Gallery, for it is a perfect example of his\r\nchief merit--the painting of quiet skies. Constable, in one of his\r\nlectures, refers to it as \"probably the finest picture of _middle-tint_\r\nin the world. The sun is rising through a thin mist, which, like the\r\neffect of a gauze blind in a room, diffuses the light equally. There\r\nare no large dark masses, there is no evasion in any part of this\r\nadmirable work, every object is fairly painted in a firm style of\r\nexecution, yet in no other picture have I seen the evanescent character\r\nof light so well expressed\" (Leslie's _Life of Constable_, p. 338).\r\n\"The effect of the breeze upon the water and upon the trees,\" says\r\nOttley, \"and the freshness of the morning atmosphere, in this picture,\r\nare expressed with a closeness of imitation bordering on illusion\"\r\n(_Descriptive Catalogue of the National Gallery_, 1826, p. 42).\r\n\r\nAs for the subject: St. Ursula, a beautiful and gifted Sicilian\r\nprincess, was sought in marriage by a prince of Britain; but having\r\nalready dedicated herself to Christ, she made a condition that before\r\nher marriage, she, with eleven thousand attendant virgins, should be\r\npermitted for the space of three years to visit the shrines of the\r\nSaints. This being permitted, the maidens started on a miraculous\r\nvoyage. Guided by angels they proceeded as far as Rome, where pagans\r\nhaving plotted their death, on their further journey to Cologne they\r\nwere martyred by the barbarians besieging that city. Here in the\r\npicture they are represented as embarking.\r\n\r\n\r\n31. THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC.\r\n\r\n  _Gaspard Poussin_ (French: 1613-1675).\r\n\r\n      Among the artists who were most closely associated with\r\n      Nicolas Poussin (_see_ 39) were his wife's brothers, Giovanni\r\n      and Gaspard Dughet. The former was loved by Poussin as a\r\n      son; the latter was also his pupil and adopted his name,\r\n      though in France he is familiarly known as \"Le Guaspre.\"\r\n      Gaspard was Poussin's junior by nineteen years, and the older\r\n      man, recognising his abilities, encouraged him to landscape\r\n      painting. By the time he was twenty, Gaspard had established\r\n      himself as an independent painter in Rome, and his works were\r\n      eagerly sought by lovers of art. The Palazzo Doria and the\r\n      Palazzo Colonna are especially rich in his works; the picture\r\n      now before us, by some considered Gaspard's masterpiece, was\r\n      formerly in the latter palace. Gaspard resided chiefly at\r\n      Rome, but he also rented houses at Frascati and at Tivoli.\r\n      In the noble scenery of those places and elsewhere in the\r\n      country around Rome, he found the subjects for many of his\r\n      best pictures. He worked so rapidly, we are told, that he\r\n      would often \"finish a picture in a day.\" He had a genuine love\r\n      for nature, and also a passion for the chase. \"A little ass,\r\n      that he cared for himself, his only servant, bore his entire\r\n      apparatus, provisions, and a tent, under which, protected\r\n      from the sun and wind, he made his landscapes.\" There is\r\n      (says Ruskin) more serious feeling in his landscapes, more\r\n      \"perception of the moral truth of nature,\" and \"grander\r\n      reachings after sympathy\" than in those either of Nicolas or\r\n      of Claude. It is impossible to look at many of his pictures\r\n      in this Gallery without sharing the sense of grandeur and\r\n      infinity in nature which inspired them, and hence it is that\r\n      from Gaspard's own time till now they have enjoyed \"a permanent\r\n      power of address to the human heart.\" But more than this\r\n      has been claimed for Gaspard. Critics thought they found in\r\n      his works faithful adherence to the truths of nature in sky\r\n      and trees. Ottley, for instance, in his _Catalogue of the\r\n      National Gallery_ (1826), speaks of Gaspard's \"unrivalled\r\n      correctness of imitation.\" Against these claims Ruskin took\r\n      up his fiery parable. Gaspard's pictures are \"full,\" he says,\r\n      \"of the most degraded mannerism;\" first and foremost, in his\r\n      search of a false sublimity, he painted every object in his\r\n      picture, vegetation and all, of one dull gray and brown; and\r\n      too many of his landscapes are now one dry, volcanic darkness.\r\n      And secondly, he had a total want of imagination in seizing\r\n      the true forms of natural objects, so that some passages of\r\n      his landscapes are, as we shall see, perfect epitomes of the\r\n      falseness to nature in the painters of that age[64] (collected\r\n      from _Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. §§ 3,\r\n      14; vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. v. § 12, sec ii. ch. ii. §\r\n      18; vol. iv. pt. v. ch. xvi. § 24).\r\n\r\nThese remarks cannot be better illustrated than in the present picture.\r\nAbraham and Isaac--the former with a lighted torch, the latter with\r\nthe wood--are ascending the hill on the right to the sacrifice; while\r\nAbraham's two servants await his return below. The whole spirit of the\r\npicture is \"solemn and unbroken,\" in perfect harmony with the subject.\r\nBut it is kept from being a really grand picture by the \"hopeless want\r\nof imagination\" in the forms of the clouds, the colour of the sky, and\r\nthe treatment of the distant landscape. These painters, says Ruskin,\r\nlooked at clouds, \"with utter carelessness and bluntness of feeling;\r\nsaw that there were a great many rounded passages in them; found it\r\nmuch easier to sweep circles than to design beauties, and sat down\r\nin their studies, contented with perpetual repetitions of the same\r\nspherical conceptions, having about the same relation to the clouds\r\nof nature, that a child's carving of a turnip has to the head of the\r\nApollo.... Take the ropy, tough-looking wreath in the 'Sacrifice\r\nof Isaac,' and find one part of it, if you can, which is not the\r\nrepetition of every other part of it, all together being as round and\r\nvapid as the brush could draw them\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii.\r\nsec. iii. ch. iii. § 8). Equally deficient is the colour of the sky:--\r\n\r\n      \"It is here high noon, as is shown by the shadow of the\r\n      figures; and what sort of colour is the sky at the top of the\r\n      picture? Is it pale and gray with heat, full of sunshine,\r\n      and unfathomable in depth? On the contrary, it is of a pitch\r\n      of darkness which, except on Mont Blanc or Chimborazo, is as\r\n      purely impossible as colour can be. He might as well have\r\n      painted it coal-black: and it is laid on with a dead coat of\r\n      flat paint, having no one quality or resemblance of sky about\r\n      it. It cannot have altered, because the land horizon is as\r\n      delicate and tender in tone as possible, and is evidently\r\n      unchanged; and to complete the absurdity of the whole thing,\r\n      this colour holds its own, without gradation or alteration, to\r\n      within three or four degrees of the horizon, where it suddenly\r\n      becomes bold and unmixed yellow. Now the horizon at noon may be\r\n      yellow when the whole sky is covered with dark clouds, and only\r\n      _one_ open streak of light left in the distance from which the\r\n      whole light proceeds; but with a clear, open sky, and opposite\r\n      the sun, at noon, such a yellow horizon as this is physically\r\n      impossible.... We have in this sky (and it is a fine picture,\r\n      one of the best of Gaspar's that I know) a notable example of\r\n      the truth of the old masters--two impossible colours impossibly\r\n      united!... Nor is this a solitary instance; it is Gaspar\r\n      Poussin's favourite and characteristic effect\" (_ibid._, vol.\r\n      i. pt. ii. sec. iii. ch. i. § 10).\r\n\r\nLastly, the same want of truth is shown in the wide expanse stretching\r\naway to the distance:--\r\n\r\n      \"It is luminous, retiring, delicate and perfect in tone, and\r\n      is quite complete enough to deceive and delight the careless\r\n      eye to which all distances are alike; nay, it is perfect\r\n      and masterly, and absolutely right, if we consider it as a\r\n      sketch,--as a first plan of a distance, afterwards to be\r\n      carried out in detail. But we must remember that all these\r\n      alternate spaces of gray and gold are not the landscape itself,\r\n      but the treatment of it; not its substance, but its light and\r\n      shade. They are just what nature would cast over it, and write\r\n      upon it with every cloud, but which she would cast in play, and\r\n      without carefulness, as matters of the very smallest possible\r\n      importance. All her work and her attention would be given to\r\n      bring out from underneath this, and through this, the forms\r\n      and the material character which this can only be valuable to\r\n      illustrate, not to conceal. Every one of those broad spaces she\r\n      would linger over in protracted delight, teaching you fresh\r\n      lessons in every hair's-breadth of it, until the mind lost\r\n      itself in following her; now fringing the dark edge of the\r\n      shadow with a tufted line of level forest; now losing it for an\r\n      instant in a breath of mist; then breaking it with the white\r\n      gleaming angle of a narrow brook; then dwelling upon it again\r\n      in a gentle, mounded, melting undulation, over the other side\r\n      of which she would carry you down into a dusty space of soft\r\n      crowded light, with the hedges and the paths and the sprinkled\r\n      cottages and scattered trees mixed up and mingled together in\r\n      one beautiful, delicate, impenetrable mystery, sparkling and\r\n      melting, and passing away into the sky, without one line of\r\n      distinctness, or one instant of vacancy\"[65] (_ibid._, vol. i.\r\n      pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. v. § 8).\r\n\r\n\r\n32. THE RAPE OF GANYMEDE.\r\n\r\n  _School of Titian. See under 4._\r\n\r\nGanymede--so the Greek story ran--was a beautiful Trojan boy beloved\r\nof Jupiter, and was carried off by an eagle to Olympus to be the\r\ncup-bearer of the gods. Which things, say some, are an allegory--for\r\n\"those whom the gods love die young,\" and are snatched off, it may be,\r\nin sudden death, as by an eagle's swoop.\r\n\r\n    Flushed Ganymede, his rosy thigh\r\n    Half-buried in the Eagle's down,\r\n    Sole as a flying star shot thro' the sky.\r\n\r\n  TENNYSON: _Palace of Art_.\r\n\r\nThis picture was painted, like Tintoret's \"Milky Way\" (1313) and the\r\nfour Veroneses (1318, 1324-6), for a compartment of a ceiling. It\r\ncorresponds with a picture described by Ridolfi as painted by a scholar\r\nof Titian, though some connect it rather with Tintoret (see J. B. S.\r\nHolborn's _Tintoretto_, 1903, pp. 34, 35). It was formerly in the\r\nColonna Palace: the background is a restoration by Carlo Maratti (_see_\r\n174).\r\n\r\n\r\n33. THE VISION OF ST. JEROME.\r\n\r\n  _Parmigiano_ (Parmese: 1503-1540).\r\n\r\n      A picture of great interest both for itself and for the\r\n      circumstances under which it was painted. Parmigiano was\r\n      painting it at Rome in 1527 when the city was sacked by the\r\n      army of the Emperor Charles V. under Constable Bourbon. So\r\n      intent, says Vasari, was our artist on his work that \"when his\r\n      own dwelling was filled with certain of these men, who were\r\n      Germans, he remained undisturbed by their clamours, and did\r\n      not move from his place; arriving in the room therefore, and\r\n      finding him thus employed, they stood confounded at the beauty\r\n      of the paintings they beheld, and, like good and sensible men\r\n      as they must have been, they permitted him to continue his\r\n      occupation.\"[66] Parmigiano had other narrow escapes in his\r\n      career, which ultimately came to a bad end, owing, Vasari says,\r\n      to his forsaking painting for alchemy, \"since he believed\r\n      that he should make himself rich much more rapidly by the\r\n      congelation of mercury than by his art.\"\r\n\r\n      Francesco Maria Mazzola was called Parmigiano from Parma, his\r\n      birthplace. After Correggio settled there, Parmigiano devoted\r\n      himself to the study and imitation of that master. In 1523 he\r\n      went to Rome, to study the works of Raphael and Michael Angelo.\r\n      In 1531 he returned to Parma, and undertook an important\r\n      commission to paint in one of its churches. He was paid in\r\n      advance, and when after five years he had not begun the work\r\n      he was imprisoned for breach of contract. He was released on\r\n      a promise that he would proceed with the frescoes, but he fled\r\n      the city, and shortly afterwards died, in his thirty-seventh\r\n      year. The chequered life of the artist finds a parallel in the\r\n      varying fortunes of his reputation as an artist. He was an\r\n      imitator both of Correggio and of Michael Angelo--here, for\r\n      instance, the head of the infant Christ recalls the former\r\n      master, the figures of St. Jerome and St. John recall the\r\n      latter; and in his own day was held to have imitated them\r\n      successfully, whilst Vasari adds that \"the spirit of Raphael\r\n      was said to have passed into Parmigiano.\" Of one of his works\r\n      Reynolds, two hundred years later, expressed himself \"at a loss\r\n      which to admire most, the correctness of drawing or grandeur\r\n      of conception.\" But the fashion in art has changed since\r\n      Reynolds's day, and modern critics have found Parmigiano's work\r\n      \"incongruous,\" \"insipid,\" and \"affected.\" This difference of\r\n      opinion is well exemplified in the case of this picture. Vasari\r\n      calls it \"singularly beautiful,\" and its subsequent popularity\r\n      is attested by the number of copies of it extant (visitors on\r\n      Students' Days will still often see copyists at work on it).\r\n      But other critics have attributed its fame \"more to its defects\r\n      than its beauties\" (Passavant), and have found it \"mannered and\r\n      theatrical\" (Mrs. Jameson), and \"a pernicious adaptation of an\r\n      incongruous style\" (Dr. Richter).\r\n\r\nLeaving the visitor to form his own judgment, we may remind him that\r\nthe subject is a supposed dream of St. Jerome when doing penance in the\r\ndesert. He is asleep on the ground--doing penance, it might seem from\r\nhis distorted position, even in his sleep, with a skull before him and\r\na crucifix beside him. He is in the same desert where John the Baptist\r\nonce preached, and thinking, we may suppose, of him, St. Jerome sees\r\nhim in vision--with his camel skin about him--pointing upwards to the\r\nsky. There is the Virgin Mary seated as queen of heaven on a crescent\r\nmoon, with a palm branch in her hand--the symbol now, not of martyrdom,\r\nbut of victory over sin and death. And on her knee is the Divine Child,\r\nwho rests his right hand on a little book on the Madonna's lap. It\r\nis a volume, we may suppose, of the Scriptures which St. Jerome had\r\ntranslated, and the vision thus foreshadows the time when it should be\r\nsaid unto him, \"Well done, thou good and faithful servant; ... enter\r\nthou into the joy of thy Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n34. VENUS AND ADONIS.\r\n\r\n  _Titian_ (Venetian: 1477-1576). _See_ 4.\r\n\r\nVenus is endeavouring to detain Adonis from the chase; but the sun is\r\nup (see his chariot in the sky) and the young huntsman is eager to be\r\noff with his hounds and his spear. The enamoured goddess caresses him,\r\nbut it will be in vain. For Cupid, the god of love, is not there: he is\r\nasleep and at a distance, with his bow and quiver hanging on a tree;\r\nand all the blandishments of beauty, unaided by love, are as naught.\r\n\r\n    Even as the sun with purple-colour'd face\r\n    Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,\r\n    Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;\r\n    Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;\r\n      Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,\r\n      And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.\r\n\r\n  SHAKESPEARE: _Venus and Adonis_.\r\n\r\nThis picture (formerly in the Colonna Palace at Rome) is probably a\r\nstudio-repetition of an original which is now at Madrid, and which\r\nwas painted by Titian for Philip II. of Spain, then King-Consort of\r\nEngland. It was forwarded to him in London in 1554. The picture is\r\nthus forty years later than the \"Bacchus and Ariadne,\" and critics\r\nfind in it not unjustly a lack of the finer poetry which characterises\r\nthe earlier classical works of the master. \"That the aim of the artist\r\nwas not a very high one, or this _poesia_ very near to his heart, is\r\ndemonstrated by the curiously material fashion in which he recommends\r\nit to his royal patron. He says that 'if in the _Danaë_ (now at Naples)\r\nthe forms were to be seen front-wise, here was occasion to look at\r\nthem from a contrary direction--a pleasant variety for the ornament of\r\na _camerino_.' Our worldly-wise painter evidently knew that material\r\nallurements as well as supreme art were necessary to captivate Philip\"\r\n(Claude Philips: _The Later Work of Titian_, p. 80).\r\n\r\n\r\n35. BACCHUS AND ARIADNE.\r\n\r\n  _Titian_ (Venetian: 1477-1576). _See_ 4.\r\n\r\nA picture which is at once a school of poetry and a school of art--\"in\r\nits combination of all the qualities which go to make a great work\r\nof art possibly the finest picture in the world\" (Poynter). It is\r\na translation on canvas of the scene described in Catullus, where\r\nBacchus, the wine-god, returning with his revel rout from a sacrifice,\r\nfinds Ariadne on the seashore, after she had been deserted by Theseus,\r\nher lover. Bacchus no sooner sees her than he is enamoured and\r\ndetermines to make her his bride--\r\n\r\n    Bounding along is blooming Bacchus seen,\r\n    With all his heart aflame with love for thee,\r\n    Fair Ariadne! and behind him, see,\r\n    Where Satyrs and Sileni whirl along,\r\n    With frenzy fired, a fierce tumultuous throng....\r\n    There some wave thyrsi wreathed with ivy, here\r\n    Some toss the limbs of a dismembered steer....\r\n    Others with open palms the timbrel smite,\r\n    Or with their brazen rods make tinklings light.\r\n\r\n  _Carmen_ lxiv.: Sir T. Martin's translation.\r\n\r\nNothing can be finer than the painter's representation of Bacchus and\r\nhis rout: there is a \"divine inebriety\" in the god which is the very\r\n\"incarnation of the spirit of revelry.\" \"With this telling of the\r\nstory,\" says Charles Lamb (Essay on _Barrenness of the Imaginative\r\nFaculty in the Productions of Modern Art_), \"an artist, and no ordinary\r\none, might remain richly proud.... But Titian has recalled past time,\r\nand made it contributory with the present to one simultaneous effect.\r\nWith the desert all ringing with the mad cymbals of his followers, made\r\nlucid with the presence and new offers of a god,--as if unconscious\r\nof Bacchus, or but idly casting her eyes as upon some unconcerning\r\npageant, her soul undistracted from Theseus, Ariadne is still pacing\r\nthe solitary shore, in as much heart-silence, and in almost the same\r\nlocal solitude, with which she awoke at daybreak to catch the forlorn\r\nlast glances of the sail that bore away the Athenian.\" But though\r\nas yet half unconscious, Ariadne is already under her fated star:\r\nfor above is the constellation of Ariadne's crown--the crown with\r\nwhich Bacchus presented his bride. And observe in connection with the\r\nastronomical side of the allegory the figure in Bacchus's train with\r\nthe serpent round him: this is the serpent-bearer (Milton's \"Orphiucus\r\nhuge\") translated to the skies with Bacchus and Ariadne. Notice too\r\nanother piece of poetry: the marriage of Bacchus and Ariadne took place\r\nin the spring, Ariadne herself being the personification of its return,\r\nand Bacchus of its gladness; hence the flowers in the foreground which\r\ndeck his path.\r\n\r\nThe picture is as full of the painter's art as of the poet's. Note\r\nfirst the exquisite painting of the vine leaves,[67] and of the\r\nflowers in the foreground, as an instance of the \"constant habit of\r\nthe great masters to render every detail of their foreground with\r\nthe most laborious botanical fidelity\": \"The foreground is occupied\r\nwith the common blue iris, the _aquilegia_, and the wild rose (more\r\ncorrectly the _Capparis spinosa_); _every stamen_ of which latter is\r\ngiven, while the blossoms and leaves of the columbine (a difficult\r\nflower to draw) have been studied with the most exquisite accuracy.\"\r\nBut this detail is sought not for its own sake, but only so far as is\r\nnecessary to mark the typical qualities of beauty in the object. Thus\r\n\"while every stamen of the rose is given because this was necessary\r\nto mark the flower, and while the curves and large characters of the\r\nleaves are rendered with exquisite fidelity, there is no vestige of\r\nparticular texture, of moss, bloom, moisture, or any other accident,\r\nno dewdrops, nor flies, nor trickeries of any kind; nothing beyond the\r\nsimple forms and hues of the flowers, even those hues themselves being\r\nsimplified and broadly rendered. The varieties of _aquilegia_ have in\r\nreality a grayish and uncertain tone of colour, and never attain the\r\npurity of blue with which Titian has gifted his flower. But the master\r\ndoes not aim at the particular colour of individual blossoms; he seizes\r\nthe type of all, and gives it with the utmost purity and simplicity\r\nof which colour is capable.\" A second point to be noticed is the way\r\nin which one kind of truth has often to be sacrificed in order to\r\ngain another. Thus here Titian sacrifices truth of aerial effect to\r\nrichness of tone--tone in the sense, that is, of that quality of colour\r\nwhich makes us feel that the whole picture is in one climate, under\r\none kind of light, and in one kind of atmosphere. \"It is difficult to\r\nimagine anything more magnificently impossible than the blue of the\r\ndistant landscape; impossible, not from its vividness, but because it\r\nis not faint and aerial enough to account for its purity of colour; it\r\nis too dark and blue at the same time; and there is indeed so total\r\na want of atmosphere in it, that, but for the difference of form, it\r\nwould be impossible to tell the mountains intended to be ten miles\r\noff, from the robe of Ariadne close to the spectator. Yet make this\r\nblue faint, aerial, and distant; make it in the slightest degree to\r\nresemble the tint of nature's colour; and all the tone of the picture,\r\nall the intensity and splendour, will vanish on the instant\" (_Modern\r\nPainters_, vols. i., xxvii., xxx. (Preface to the Second Edition),\r\npt. i. sec. ii. ch. i. § 5, pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. i. § 15; vol. iii.\r\npt. iv. ch. ix. § 18; vol. v. pt. ix. ch. iii. § 31; _Arrows of the\r\nChace_, i. 58). We may notice lastly what Sir Joshua Reynolds points\r\nout (Discourse viii.), that the harmony of the picture--that wonderful\r\nbringing together of two times of which Lamb speaks above, is assisted\r\nby the distribution of colours. \"To Ariadne is given (say the critics)\r\na red scarf, to relieve the figure from the sea, which is behind her.\r\nIt is not for that reason alone, but for another of much greater\r\nconsequence; for the sake of the general harmony and effect of the\r\npicture. The figure of Ariadne is separated from the great group, and\r\nis dressed in blue, which, added to the colour of the sea, makes that\r\nquantity of cold colour which Titian thought necessary for the support\r\nand brilliancy of the great group; which group is composed, with very\r\nlittle exception, entirely of mellow colours. But as the picture in\r\nthis case would be divided into two distinct parts, one half cold and\r\nthe other warm, it was necessary to carry some of the mellow colours\r\nof the great group into the cold part of the picture, and a part of\r\nthe cold into the great group; accordingly, Titian gave Ariadne a red\r\nscarf, and to one of the Bacchantes a little blue drapery.\"\r\n\r\nThis famous picture was a commission from the Duke Alfonso I. of\r\nFerrara. There were great delays in its delivery, the Duke and his\r\nagents resorting alternately to threats and cajolery in order to\r\nextract the promised canvas from the painter. Among other excuses\r\nTitian said he had no canvas for it. The Duke supplied the canvas, and\r\nsent at the same time a frame. But the picture did not come. Ultimately\r\nTitian took it with him to Ferrara in 1522, and finished it there. He\r\nseems to have been engaged on it, off and on, for some three years. The\r\npicture subsequently passed into the Aldobrandini collection at Rome,\r\nfrom which it was purchased for an English collector in 1806. Twenty\r\nyears later it was acquired by the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n36. A LAND STORM.\r\n\r\n  _Gaspard Poussin_ (French: 1613-1675). _See_ 31.\r\n\r\nThe one gleam of light breaking through the clouds falls on the watch\r\ntower of a castle, perched on a rock--\"a stately image of stability,\"\r\nwhere all things else are bent beneath the power of the storm. The\r\nspirit of the picture is, however, better than its execution. Take,\r\nfor instance, the clouds. They are mere \"massive concretions of ink\r\nand indigo, wrung and twisted very hard, apparently in a vain effort\r\nto get some moisture out of them\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt.\r\nii. sec. iii. ch. iv. § 6). In the tree forms, again, Ruskin sees a\r\nconcentration of errors. \"Gaspard Poussin, by his bad drawing, does\r\nnot make his stem strong, but his tree weak; he does not make his\r\ngust violent, but his boughs of Indian-rubber\" (for details of this\r\ncriticism see _ibid._, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. vi. ch. i. §§ 12, 13).\r\n\r\n\r\n37. _See under_ 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n38. THE ABDUCTION OF THE SABINE WOMEN.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640).\r\n\r\n      Peter Paul Rubens, born on the festival of Saints Peter and\r\n      Paul (hence his Christian name), is the chief glory of the\r\n      Flemish School, and one of the great masters of the world. It\r\n      is impossible to walk round any gallery where there are good\r\n      specimens of his work and not to be impressed at once with his\r\n      _power_. Here, one feels, is a strong man, who knew what he\r\n      wanted to paint, and was able to paint it. Whatever moral or\r\n      poetical feelings he had or had not, he was at any rate master\r\n      of the painter's language,[68] and this language is itself \"so\r\n      difficult and so vast, that the mere possession of it argues\r\n      the man is great, and that his works are worth reading.\" \"I\r\n      have never spoken,\" says Ruskin elsewhere, \"and I never will\r\n      speak of Rubens but with the most reverential feeling; and\r\n      whatever imperfections in his art may have resulted from his\r\n      unfortunate want of seriousness and incapability of true\r\n      passion, his calibre of mind was originally such that I\r\n      believe the world may see another Titian and another Raphael,\r\n      before it sees another Rubens.\" Rubens affords, in fact, \"the\r\n      Northern parallel to the power of the Venetians.\" Like the\r\n      Venetians, too, he is a _great colourist_. The pictures by the\r\n      later Northern painters which here hang around his are dark\r\n      and gloomy; his are all bright and golden. He is like Paul\r\n      Veronese, too, in his \"gay grasp of the outside aspects of the\r\n      world.\"[69] His pictures in this Gallery embrace a wide range\r\n      of subjects--some peaceful, others tumultuous--some religious,\r\n      others profane, but over them all is the same _gay glamour_,\r\n      \"Alike, to Rubens, came subjects of tumult or tranquillity, of\r\n      gaiety or terror; the nether, earthly, and upper world were to\r\n      him animated with the same feeling, lighted by the same sun; he\r\n      dyed in the same lake of fire the warp of the wedding-garment\r\n      or of the winding-sheet; swept into the same delirium the\r\n      recklessness of the sensualist and rapture of the anchorite;\r\n      saw in tears only their glittering, and in torture only its\r\n      flush.\" A fourth characteristic, which also cannot fail to\r\n      be perceived in a general survey of Rubens's pictures in the\r\n      Gallery, remains to be noticed. In all his exuberant joyousness\r\n      is a strain of _coarseness_, \"a want of feeling for grace and\r\n      mystery.\" \"There is an absence everywhere of refinement and\r\n      delicacy, a preference everywhere for abundant and excessive\r\n      types.\" He would have agreed, one may think, with the saying\r\n      of Blake (in the _Marriage of Heaven and Hell_), \"exuberance\r\n      is beauty,\"--Madonnas, goddesses, Roman matrons, have all\r\n      alike a touch of grossness. Rubens, says Fromentin, \"is very\r\n      earthy, more earthy than any among the masters whose equal he\r\n      is, but the painter comes to the aid of the draughtsman and the\r\n      thinker, and sets them free.\" To like effect Heine speaks of\r\n      \"the colossal good humour of that Netherlands Titan, the wings\r\n      of whose spirit were so strong that they bore him up to the\r\n      sun, in spite of the hundredweights of Dutch cheese hanging to\r\n      his legs.\"\r\n\r\n      It is instructive to notice how the art of Rubens was\r\n      characteristic of the circumstances of his life and time. In\r\n      the first place, though he travelled in many lands, Rubens\r\n      remained to the end a Fleming, every inch of him.[70] \"A man\r\n      long trained to love the monk's visions of Fra Angelico,\r\n      turns in proud and ineffable disgust from the first work of\r\n      Rubens which he encounters on his return across the Alps. But\r\n      is he right in his indignation? He has forgotten that while\r\n      Angelico prayed and wept in his _olive shade_, there was\r\n      different work doing in the dank fields of Flanders;--wild\r\n      seas to be banked out; endless canals to be dug, and boundless\r\n      marshes to be drained; hard ploughing and harrowing of the\r\n      frosty clay; careful breeding of stout horses and fat cattle;\r\n      close setting of brick walls against cold winds and snow;\r\n      much hardening of hands and gross stoutening of bodies in\r\n      all this; gross jovialities of harvest homes and Christmas\r\n      feasts which were to be the reward of it; rough affections,\r\n      and sluggish imaginations; fleshy, substantial, iron-shod\r\n      humanities, but humanities still; humanities which God had\r\n      his eye upon, and which won, perhaps, here and there, as much\r\n      favour in his sight as the wasted aspects of the whispering\r\n      monks of Florence. (Heaven forbid it should not be so, since\r\n      the most of us cannot be monks, but must be ploughmen and\r\n      reapers still.) And are we to suppose there is no nobility in\r\n      Rubens's masculine and universal sympathy with all this, and\r\n      with his large human rendering of it, Gentleman though he was,\r\n      by birth, and feeling, and education, and place; and, when he\r\n      chose, lordly in conception also? He had his faults, perhaps\r\n      great and lamentable faults, though more those of his time and\r\n      his country than his own; he has neither cloister breeding nor\r\n      boudoir breeding, and is very unfit to paint either in missals\r\n      or annuals; but he has an open sky and wide-world breeding in\r\n      him, that we may not be offended with, fit alike for king's\r\n      court, knight's camp, or peasant's cottage.\" It is thus that\r\n      Rubens was a child of Flanders. But he was also a child of\r\n      the intellectual time in which he lived. He was born at a\r\n      time, says Ruskin, when the Reformation had been arrested--his\r\n      father, curiously enough, had fled from Antwerp as a Reformer,\r\n      but afterwards returned to Catholicism. \"The Evangelicals\r\n      despised the arts, while the Roman Catholics were effete or\r\n      insincere, and could not retain influence over men of strong\r\n      reasoning power. The painters could only associate frankly with\r\n      men of the world, and themselves became men of the world. Men,\r\n      I mean, having no belief in spiritual existences, no interests\r\n      or affections beyond the grave. Not but that they still painted\r\n      Scriptural subjects. Altarpieces were wanted occasionally,\r\n      and pious patrons sometimes commissioned a cabinet Madonna.\r\n      But there is just this difference between men of this modern\r\n      period and the Florentines or Venetians--that, whereas the\r\n      latter never exert themselves fully except on a sacred subject,\r\n      the Flemish and Dutch masters are always languid unless they\r\n      are profane.\" Rubens was thus a man of the world. When a\r\n      boy he was for some time page in the family of a countess\r\n      at Brussels. But his bent towards art was too strong to be\r\n      gainsaid. When only twenty-two he was already a master-painter\r\n      in the Antwerp Guild. Two years later he went to Italy, and\r\n      for eight years he was in the service of the Duke of Mantua.\r\n      An excellent Latin scholar, he was also proficient in French,\r\n      Italian, English, German, and Dutch. These gifts procured him\r\n      diplomatic employment. In 1603 \"the Fleming,\" as they called\r\n      him, was sent on a mission to Spain. In 1608 news of his\r\n      mother's illness reached him, and he hastened home, when he was\r\n      appointed court-painter to the Archduke Albert, then Governor\r\n      of the Netherlands. In 1620 he visited Paris, at the invitation\r\n      of Mary de' Medici (a sister of the Duchess of Mantua), and\r\n      received the commission for the celebrated series of pictures\r\n      now in the Louvre, commemorating the marriage of that princess\r\n      with Henry IV. of France. In 1628 Rubens was sent on a\r\n      mission to Philip IV. of Spain, and made the acquaintance of\r\n      Velazquez. The great decorative master and the great realist\r\n      (his junior by twenty-two years) painted together, travelled\r\n      together, and talked together for eight or nine months. Rubens,\r\n      we are told, was never so well pleased as when he was in the\r\n      company of Velazquez, and Velazquez showed no resentment at\r\n      the commissions given by the court to the foreign painter. In\r\n      1629 Rubens was sent to Charles I. of England (_see under_ 46),\r\n      by whom, in the following year, he was knighted. He was also\r\n      given an honorary degree by the University of Cambridge. On\r\n      this occasion, Rubens was commissioned to paint the pictures\r\n      which adorn the ceiling of the Banqueting Hall of Whitehall\r\n      (now the United Service Institution). Wherever he went Rubens\r\n      continued to paint, and his diplomacy he considered as mere\r\n      recreation. \"The painter Rubens,\" he is reported to have said\r\n      of himself, \"amuses himself with being ambassador.\" \"So said\r\n      one with whom, but for his own words, we might have thought\r\n      that effort had been absorbed in power, and the labour of\r\n      his art in its felicity.\" How hard he laboured is known by\r\n      the enormous number of his works which still survive, by the\r\n      large fortune he amassed, and by the great request in which\r\n      his talents were held. \"Whatever work of his I may require,\"\r\n      wrote a celebrated Antwerp printer, \"I have to ask him six\r\n      months before, so as that he may think of it at leisure, and do\r\n      the work on Sundays or holidays; no week-days of his could I\r\n      pretend to get under 100 florins.\" But of the several thousands\r\n      of works ascribed to the master, many were painted from his\r\n      sketches by pupils and assistants. \"To put it plainly, Rubens\r\n      established a picture factory at Antwerp. He was thus enabled\r\n      to paint portraits, landscapes, hunting scenes, and pictures\r\n      of _genre_, as well as to undertake several series of gigantic\r\n      decorations as important as those of Raphael or Michael\r\n      Angelo. The master made small, lively sketches of the work to\r\n      be done, the pupils laid them in, each doing what suited his\r\n      talent, while Rubens reserved to himself the duty of bringing\r\n      the picture together; in some cases by using the work beneath\r\n      as a ground for almost complete repainting, in most cases by\r\n      mainly correcting here and there, or enhancing the effect with\r\n      a few brilliant and dexterous touches\" (R. A. M. Stevenson's\r\n      \"_Portfolio_ monograph\" on Rubens). Brueghel, Snyders, Teniers,\r\n      and Van Dyck were among his assistants. Some of Rubens's\r\n      letters contain curious information on his methods. Thus he\r\n      offers to Sir Dudley Carleton certain pictures in exchange for\r\n      a collection of antique marbles. Among them was to be \"'A Last\r\n      Judgment,' begun by one of my pupils after an original which I\r\n      made of much larger size for the Prince of Neubourg, who paid\r\n      me for it 3500 florins in ready money. As the present piece is\r\n      not quite finished, I will retouch it altogether by myself, so\r\n      that it can pass for an original: 1200 florins.\"\r\n\r\n      Rubens was unspoilt by success. Like many other great artists,\r\n      he is conspicuous for \"a quite curious gentleness and serene\r\n      courtesy.... His letters are almost ludicrous in their\r\n      unhurried politeness. He was an honourable and entirely\r\n      well-intentioned man, earnestly industrious, simple and\r\n      temperate in habits of life, highbred, learned, and discreet.\r\n      His affection for his mother was great, his generosity to\r\n      contemporary artists unfailing.\" He was twice married. In\r\n      1626 his first wife, Isabella Brant, died. Four years later\r\n      he married Helena Fourment, a beautiful girl of sixteen, the\r\n      living incarnation of his feminine type. \"At the time of his\r\n      second marriage Rubens was fifty-three years of age. He led\r\n      a serious, happy, retired life. His leisure time he devoted\r\n      to his family, to a few friends, to his correspondence, his\r\n      collections, and his rides.\" \"In the morning,\" we read, \"he\r\n      rose very early, and while he painted someone read aloud Livy,\r\n      Plutarch, Cicero, Virgil or other poets. Then he would stroll\r\n      in his gallery to stimulate his taste by the sight of the works\r\n      of art he had brought from Italy. On other occasions he would\r\n      study science, in which he always retained an active interest.\r\n      Although he lived splendidly, he ate and drank moderately, and\r\n      the gout from which he suffered in later life was certainly\r\n      undeserved. He painted in the afternoon till towards evening,\r\n      when he mounted a horse and rode out of the town.\" His house\r\n      at Antwerp still stands; as also does his country-house, near\r\n      Mechlin, of which there is a view in our Gallery (No. 66)\r\n      (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. § 15, sec.\r\n      ii. ch. ii. § 12; vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. i. § 2; vol.\r\n      iv. pt. v. ch. i. § 17; vol. v. pt. viii. ch. iv. § 21, pt.\r\n      ix. ch. vi. §§ 1-9; _On the Old Road_, i. 185, 186; _Stones of\r\n      Venice_, vol. i. App. 15; Wauters, _The Flemish School_, p.\r\n      214).\r\n\r\n\"A miracle of agitation. A flush tide of the richest colour, which\r\npositively seems to boil up in swirling eddies of harmonious form.\r\nIts whole surface is swept by lines which rush each other on like the\r\nrapid successive entrances of an excited _stretto_, till the violent\r\nmovement seems to undulate the entire pattern of the picture\" (R.\r\nA. M. Stevenson: _Velazquez_, 1899, p. 51). As for the subject, see\r\nfor the story of the Sabine women under 644. But the subject in this\r\ncase does not greatly matter. \"Rubens in one of his most marvellous\r\npictures, the Rape of the Sabines, which hangs in the National Gallery,\r\ndid not even take the trouble to dress his Sabines in the costumes\r\nof their day. Without any more ado he dressed them in the style of\r\nthe seventeenth century. One might rather think it a kidnapping of\r\nbeautiful Antwerp women on a Flemish fair-day. But what difference does\r\nit make? He has _made_ white shoulders that shine, sumptuous stuffs,\r\nwarriors with glittering arms--all which is instinct with life, and\r\nblazes with the deepest colouring of the greatest of Flemish masters.\r\nThe colourists have never considered the subject otherwise than as a\r\nmeans of representing life under such and such actions, or such and\r\nsuch aspects, joyful or sad, or simply plastic\" (Benjamin Constant in\r\n_North American Review_, Nov. 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n39. THE NURSING OF BACCHUS.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Poussin_ (French: 1593[71]-1665).\r\n\r\n      The life of Nicolas Poussin may be summed up in the cry of\r\n      Æneas, _Italiam petimus_--we make for Italy. He was born in\r\n      Normandy, of a noble family, and first learnt painting under\r\n      Quintin Varin at Les Andelys. When eighteen he went to Paris\r\n      and became acquainted with Courtois, the mathematician, whose\r\n      collection of Italian prints fired him with a desire to go to\r\n      Rome. This devotion to Rome became from that day the leading\r\n      point alike in his life and in his art. Among the artist\r\n      friends of his wandering years was Philippe de Champaigne\r\n      (see under 798). After several unsuccessful efforts to get to\r\n      Rome, Poussin made the acquaintance at Lyons of the Italian\r\n      poet Marino, who invited him to Rome (1624), and introduced\r\n      him to Cardinal Barberini. The Cardinal, however, was called\r\n      away, and for a time Poussin's life in Rome was one of severe\r\n      struggle. He also fell ill, and was nursed by a compatriot,\r\n      Dughet, whose daughter he afterwards married. The wife brought\r\n      her husband a comfortable dowry, with which a house was bought,\r\n      and the painter, now released from the pinch of poverty, was\r\n      able to give free play to his talents. In 1640 he returned to\r\n      Paris, where he was introduced by Richelieu (for whom amongst\r\n      other pictures he painted No. 62 in this Gallery) to Louis\r\n      XIII. The king appointed him his painter-in-ordinary, with a\r\n      salary of £120 and rooms in the Tuileries, but two years later,\r\n      disgusted with the intrigues and jealousies of Paris, and being\r\n      anxious to rejoin his wife, he returned to Rome, where he\r\n      remained--full of work--for the rest of his life. His house on\r\n      the Pincian, adjoining the church of the Trinita, may still be\r\n      seen, and he is buried in the church of St. Lorenzo. Poussin,\r\n      says his biographer, Bellori, led a regular life, rising early\r\n      and taking a walk for one or two hours, sometimes in the city,\r\n      but more often on Monte Pincio, not far from his house. From\r\n      these lovely gardens he could enjoy the view of Rome on its\r\n      hills; there he met his friends and discoursed on curious and\r\n      learned topics. \"In the evening he went out again and walked\r\n      on the Piazza di Spagna, at the foot of the hill, in the midst\r\n      of the strangers who congregate there. He always had friends\r\n      with him, and often they made a kind of retinue. He spoke often\r\n      of art, and so clearly, that artists and all cultivated men of\r\n      talent came to hear his beautiful and profound thoughts about\r\n      painting.\" \"During my sojourn in Rome,\" says a traveller of\r\n      that period, \"I often saw Poussin. I admired the extreme love\r\n      this excellent painter had for perfection in his art. I met\r\n      him among the ruins of Rome, in the Campagna, and on the banks\r\n      of the Tiber, and I saw him carry home stones, moss, flowers,\r\n      and other things, in order to paint them from nature. One\r\n      day I asked him how he had attained such an elevation among\r\n      the greatest artists of Italy. He answered modestly, 'I have\r\n      neglected nothing.'\"\r\n\r\n      It is Rome which gives the leading idea also to Poussin's\r\n      art. He has been called the \"Raphael of France\"; and certain\r\n      it is that at a time when the local art of France was purely\r\n      decorative in character, he returned, and strenuously adhered,\r\n      to classical traditions. Already at Paris he had studied casts\r\n      and prints after Raphael; and when he first went to Rome he\r\n      lived with Du Quesnoy (\"Il Fiammingo\"), under whom he learnt\r\n      the art of modelling _bassi-relievi_. He also studied anatomy,\r\n      and attended the academy of Domenichino, whom he considered\r\n      the first master in Rome. His profound classical learning has\r\n      caused him to be called \"the learned Poussin.\" \"He studied the\r\n      beautiful,\" says his biographer, \"in the Greek statues of the\r\n      Vatican.\" \"He studied the ancients so much,\" says Sir Joshua\r\n      Reynolds, \"that he acquired a habit of thinking in their way,\r\n      and seemed to know perfectly the actions and gestures they\r\n      would use on every occasion.\" His learning went, however,\r\n      farther than this in its influence on his art. His ideal, says\r\n      Lanzi, was that of \"philosophy in painting\"; and in one of his\r\n      letters Poussin illustrates the idea from the Greek theory\r\n      of \"modes\" in music. If a subject were serious, it should be\r\n      painted in the Doric mode; if vehement, in the Phrygian; if\r\n      plaintive, in the Lydian; if joyous, in the Ionic.[72] This\r\n      classical learning of Poussin was the source at once of his\r\n      strength and of his weakness as an artist. On the one hand, it\r\n      often made his work wonderfully harmonious and impressive. Thus\r\n      in the Ionic mode, his Bacchanalian pictures in this Gallery\r\n      and elsewhere are nearly the best representations in art of\r\n      the Epicurean ideal of life, of a world in which enjoyment is\r\n      the end of existence. \"His best works,\" says Ruskin, \"are his\r\n      Bacchanalian revels, always brightly wanton, full of frisk and\r\n      fire; but they are coarser than Titian's[73] and infinitely\r\n      less beautiful. In all minglings of the human and brutal\r\n      character he leans on the bestial, yet with a sternly Greek\r\n      severity of treatment.\" Again, in more serious Doric mode, he\r\n      is \"the great master of the elevated ideal of landscape.\" He\r\n      does not \"put much power into his landscape when it becomes\r\n      principal; the best pieces of it occur in fragments behind\r\n      his figures. Beautiful vegetation, more or less ornamental in\r\n      character, occurs in nearly all his mythological subjects, but\r\n      his pure landscape is notable only for its dignified reserve;\r\n      the great squareness and horizontality of its masses, with\r\n      lowness of tone, giving it a deeply meditative character:\"\r\n      see especially 40. On the other hand, he had the defects of\r\n      his training. It made him too restrained and too cold. \"His\r\n      peculiarities are, without exception, weaknesses, induced\r\n      in a highly intellectual and inventive mind by being fed on\r\n      medals, books, and _bassi-relievi_ instead of nature, and by\r\n      the want of any deep sensibility.\" Thus he \"had noble powers of\r\n      design, and might have been a thoroughly great painter had he\r\n      been trained in Venice;[74] but his Roman education kept him\r\n      tame; his trenchant severity was contrary to the tendencies\r\n      of his age, and had few imitators, compared to the dashing of\r\n      Salvator and the mist of Claude. These few imitators adopted\r\n      his manner without possessing either his science or invention;\r\n      and the Italian School of landscape soon expired.... This\r\n      restraint, peculiarly classical, is much too manifest in him;\r\n      for, owing to his habit of never letting himself be free, he\r\n      does nothing as well as it ought to be done, rarely even as\r\n      well as he can himself do it; and his best beauty is poor,\r\n      incomplete and characterless, though refined.\" Finally, his\r\n      \"want of sensibility permits him to paint frightful subjects\r\n      without feeling any true horror; his pictures of the plague\r\n      are thus ghastly in incident, sometimes disgusting, but never\r\n      impressive:\" see 165 (collected from _Modern Painters_, vol. i.\r\n      preface, p. xxv., pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. § 14; vol. ii. pt.\r\n      iii. sec. ii. ch. ii. § 19; vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. xviii. § 28;\r\n      vol. v. pt. ix. ch. v. § 17).\r\n\r\nThe wine-god is represented in infancy, nursed by the nymphs and fauns\r\nof Euboea, and fed not on milk but on the juice of the grape. \"The\r\npicture makes one thirsty to look at it--the colouring even is dry and\r\nadust. The figure of the infant Bacchus seems as if he would drink up a\r\nvintage--he drinks with his mouth, his hands, his belly, and his whole\r\nbody. Gargantua was nothing to him\" (Hazlitt: _Criticisms on Art_, p.\r\n33).\r\n\r\n\r\n40. LANDSCAPE: PHOCION.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Poussin_ (French: 1593-1665). _See_ 39.\r\n\r\n\"The work of a really great and intellectual mind, one of the finest\r\nlandscapes that ancient art has produced\"[75] (_Modern Painters_, vol.\r\ni. pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. i. § 8),--its excellence consisting in the\r\nperfect harmony of the landscape with the subject represented, and\r\nthus marking the painter's sense of the dependence of landscape for\r\nits greatest impressiveness on human interest. In the foreground to\r\nthe left is Phocion \"the good\"--the incorruptible Athenian general and\r\nstatesman, contemporary with Philip and Alexander the Great, of whom\r\nit is recorded that he was \"never elated in prosperity nor dejected in\r\nadversity,\" and \"never betrayed pusillanimity by a tear nor joy by a\r\nsmile.\" He wears an undyed robe, and is washing his feet at a public\r\nfountain, the dress and action being thus alike emblematic of the\r\npurity and simplicity of his life. In entire keeping with this figure\r\nof noble simplicity is the feeling of the landscape in which \"all the\r\nair a solemn stillness holds.\" In detail, however, Ruskin finds the\r\npicture deficient in truth--false, indeed, both in tone and colour (see\r\n_ibid._, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. ii. § 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n41.

A BACCHANALIAN FESTIVAL.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Poussin_ (French: 1593-1665). _See_ 39.\r\n\r\n      A realisation of the classic legends of mirth and jollity,\r\n      precisely in the spirit of Keats's ode _On a Grecian Urn_--\r\n\r\n    What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape\r\n      Of deities or mortals, or of both,\r\n        In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?\r\n      What men or gods are these? What maidens loath?\r\n    What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?\r\n        What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?\r\n\r\n      \"This masterpiece, conceived in the manner of Titian and imbued\r\n      with the spirit of the antique, full of life, and incomparable\r\n      for its qualities of drawing and painting, is perhaps the most\r\n      beautiful work which Nicolas Poussin ever painted, and, with\r\n      the 'Bacchanalian Dance' (No. 62), is among the most valued\r\n      possessions of the National Gallery\" (Poynter: _The National\r\n      Gallery_, ii. 104).\r\n\r\n\r\n43. CHRIST TAKEN DOWN FROM THE CROSS.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45.\r\n\r\nA sketch for a composition which Rembrandt etched and also drew. The\r\ndrawing is in the British Museum.

A BLEACHING GROUND.\r\n\r\n  _J. van Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1628-1682). _See_ 627.\r\n\r\nThis little picture, which dates from the earliest days of the National\r\nGallery, was for many years obscured with dirt and not exhibited to the\r\npublic. It has recently been cleaned, and shows one of the painter's\r\nfavourite subjects--the bleaching grounds in the neighbourhood of\r\nHaarlem. Before the discovery of chemical means of bleaching linen,\r\nthese were a great source of income to the town. Linen was brought here\r\nfrom all parts of the continent to be bleached, and then went back as\r\nDutch linen or Holland.\r\n\r\n\r\n45. THE WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669).\r\n\r\n      Rembrandt Harmensz--called also Van Rhyn, \"of the Rhine,\" from\r\n      having been born on the banks of that river--has a place apart\r\n      by himself in the history of painting. He is the greatest\r\n      genius of the Dutch School, and one of the six supreme masters\r\n      of the world. He is also one of the most distinctive and\r\n      individual of them all. In what, let us ask, do the genius and\r\n      the individuality of Rembrandt consist? In the first place, his\r\n      mastery of the resources of painting, within the sphere and\r\n      for the ideals he chose for himself, is surpassed by no other\r\n      artist. \"It will be remembered,\" said Millais, \"that Rembrandt\r\n      in his first period was very careful and minute in detail,\r\n      and there is evidence of stippling in his flesh-painting;\r\n      but when he grew older, and in the fulness of his power, all\r\n      appearance of such manipulation and minuteness vanished in the\r\n      breadth and facility of his brush, though the advantage of\r\n      his early manner remained. The latter manner is, of course,\r\n      much the finer and really the more finished of the two.[76] I\r\n      have closely examined his pictures at the National Gallery,\r\n      and have actually _seen_, beneath that grand veil of breadth,\r\n      the early work that his art conceals from untrained eyes--the\r\n      whole science of painting. And herein lies his superiority\r\n      to Velazquez, who, with all his mighty power and magnificent\r\n      execution, never rose to the perfection which, above all with\r\n      painters, consists in _ars celare artem_\" (_Magazine of Art_,\r\n      1888, p. 291). \"Rembrandt,\" says Sir Frederic Burton, \"would\r\n      have been unparalleled had he treated nothing but frivolous\r\n      subjects\"; but, in the second place, \"the artist was a poet\r\n      and a seer.\" He was a seer in his penetration into the mind of\r\n      man; a poet in his perception of a special kind of beauty. His\r\n      portraits have \"an inward life that belongs to no others in a\r\n      like degree.\" It is as a painter of character that he shows\r\n      himself supreme, bringing out the personality of his sitters\r\n      in their gestures and attitudes, and in the peculiarity of\r\n      bearing and expression stamped upon them by temperament and\r\n      habits. From his dramatic action and mastery of expression,\r\n      Rembrandt has been called \"the Shakespeare of Holland.\" In his\r\n      religious subjects, the originality of his mind and power of\r\n      his imagination are also conspicuous. \"He gives,\" says Ruskin,\r\n      \"pathetic or powerful fancies, founded on real Scripture\r\n      reading, and on his interest in the picturesque character of\r\n      the Jew.\" In all subjects alike, \"he moves us by his profound\r\n      sympathy with his kind, by his tragic power, by his deep\r\n      pathos, by his humour, which is thoroughly human and seldom\r\n      cynical.\" What he held up to nature--and herein is Rembrandt's\r\n      individuality most marked--was the dark mirror. \"He was,\" says\r\n      Leighton, \"the supreme painter who revealed to the world the\r\n      poetry of twilight and all the magic mystery of gloom.\" \"He was\r\n      in the mystery,\" says Burton, \"that underlies the surface of\r\n      things.\" \"He accosts with his dark lantern,\" says Fromentin,\r\n      \"the world of the marvellous, of conscience, and the ideal; he\r\n      has no master in the art of painting, because he has no equal\r\n      in the power of showing the invisible.\" \"It was his function,\"\r\n      says another critic, \"to introduce mystery as an element of\r\n      effect in the imitative arts.\" \"As by a stroke of enchantment\r\n      Rembrandt brought down a cloud over the face of nature, and\r\n      beneath it, half-revealed, half-hidden, her shapes met the\r\n      eye in aspects full of new suggestion.\"[77] In the technical\r\n      method by which Rembrandt worked out his ideal he is the great\r\n      master of the school of chiaroscuro--of those, that is, who\r\n      strive at representing not so much the colours of objects,\r\n      as the contrasts of light and shade upon them. \"If it were\r\n      possible for art to give all the truths of nature it ought to\r\n      do it. But this is not possible. Choice must always be made\r\n      of some facts which _can_ be represented from among others\r\n      which must be passed by in silence, or even, in some respects,\r\n      misrepresented.... Rembrandt always chooses to represent the\r\n      exact force with which the light on the most illumined part\r\n      of an object is opposed to its obscurer portions. In order\r\n      to obtain this, in most cases, not very important truth, he\r\n      sacrifices the light and colour of five-sixths of his picture;\r\n      and the expression of every character of objects which\r\n      depends on tenderness of shape or tint. But he obtains his\r\n      single truth, and what picturesque and forcible expression is\r\n      dependent upon it, with magnificent skill and subtlety.\"[78]\r\n      Rembrandt \"sacrifices the light and colour of five-sixths of\r\n      his picture.\" This is inevitable. For both the light and the\r\n      darkness of nature are inimitable by art. \"The whole question,\r\n      therefore, is simply whether you will be false at one end of\r\n      the scale or at the other--that is, whether you will lose\r\n      yourself in light or in darkness.... What Veronese does is\r\n      to make his colours true to nature as far as he can. What\r\n      Rembrandt does is to make his contrasts true, never minding\r\n      his colours--with the result that in most cases not one colour\r\n      is absolutely true.\"[79] An exception, however, must be made.\r\n      For he often \"chose subjects in which the real colours were\r\n      very nearly imitable,--as single heads with dark backgrounds,\r\n      in which nature's highest light was little above his own.\" He\r\n      was particularly fond also of dark scenes lighted only by some\r\n      small spot of light; as, for instance, in this picture and in\r\n      No. 47.\r\n\r\n      The technical skill and sense of power which distinguish\r\n      Rembrandt's work are reflected in his life--a life of hard\r\n      labour, sinking towards its close into deep gloom, and a life\r\n      at all times of a certain aloofness and of restricted vision.\r\n      He was born at Leyden, being the fifth child of a miller, and\r\n      from a very early age set himself to etch and sketch the common\r\n      things about the mill. \"His father's mill was, doubtless,\r\n      Rembrandt's school; the strong and solitary light, with its\r\n      impenetrable obscurity around, the characteristic feature of\r\n      many of Rembrandt's best works, is just such an effect as would\r\n      be produced by the one ray admitted into the lofty chamber of a\r\n      mill from the small window, its ventilator\" (Wornum). He never\r\n      went to Italy or cultivated the grand style. He studied the\r\n      life and manner of his own time and people. His models were\r\n      not conspicuous for elegance; beauty of form was not within\r\n      the compass of his art. He was indefatigable in making studies\r\n      both of himself and of his mother. Among the things he studied\r\n      were, it must be admitted, the lowest functions of humanity and\r\n      often obscenities of a rollicking kind; coarseness of manner\r\n      and conversation was common at that time. Rembrandt studied for\r\n      a short period under a well-known painter, Pieter Lastman, at\r\n      Amsterdam, where he had for a fellow-pupil a fellow-townsman,\r\n      Jan Lievens (see 1095), but returned to Leyden in 1624,\r\n      determined \"to study and practise in his own fashion.\" He soon\r\n      acquired a considerable reputation; a Dutch poet, in a book\r\n      published in 1630, refers to him as an instance of precocity,\r\n      and in disproof of the doctrine of heredity. Rembrandt,\r\n      \"beardless, yet already famous,\" was the son of a miller, \"made\r\n      of other flour than his father's.\" As most of his sitters lived\r\n      in Amsterdam, then a great centre of wealth and learning,\r\n      Rembrandt moved to that city in 1631. The famous \"Anatomy\r\n      Lesson,\" now in the Museum at the Hague, was produced in the\r\n      following year. \"He lived very simply,\" we are told, \"and when\r\n      at work contented himself with a herring or a piece of cheese\r\n      and bread; his only extravagance was a passion for collecting.\"\r\n      In 1634 he married Saskia Uilenburg, a lady of a good Frisian\r\n      family, and possessed of some fortune. Her features may be\r\n      recognised in a large number of the painter's pictures; in none\r\n      more attractively rendered than in the famous picture of the\r\n      Dresden Gallery, in which she is sitting on her husband's knee.\r\n      During this period of Rembrandt's life all went well with him.\r\n      Commissions poured in; his studio was crowded with scholars,\r\n      and his etchings spread his fame far beyond his native land.\r\n      He lived for his art and his home, mixing little in society.\r\n      \"When I want to give my wits a rest,\" he said, \"I do not look\r\n      for honour, but for liberty.\" \"When he was painting,\" said\r\n      one of his biographers, \"he would not have given audience\r\n      to the greatest monarch on earth, but would have compelled\r\n      even such an one to wait or to come again when he was more at\r\n      leisure.\" He never travelled, even in Holland, and he dwelt\r\n      apart. He had few books, but his taste in art was catholic.\r\n      To his passion for collecting we have already referred. His\r\n      house, which still stands in the Breedstraat, was a museum of\r\n      curiosities, containing costly materials, stuffed animals,\r\n      richly ornamented weapons, casts, engravings, and pictures\r\n      (including works by Palma Vecchio and Giorgione). The pearls,\r\n      precious stones, rich necklaces, clasps and bracelets of every\r\n      kind that Saskia wears in her portraits were not gems of the\r\n      painter's imagination, but actual objects from the jewel-cases\r\n      which he filled for his wife. \"When Rembrandt was present\r\n      at a sale,\" says Baldinucci, \"it was his habit, especially\r\n      when pictures drawn by great masters were put up, to make an\r\n      enormous advance on the first bid, which generally silenced all\r\n      competition. To those who expressed their surprise at such a\r\n      proceeding, he replied that by this means he hoped to raise the\r\n      status of his profession.\" This lordly buying was the undoing\r\n      of Rembrandt's worldly fortunes. In 1642 Saskia died, and his\r\n      financial embarrassments, which had already begun, went from\r\n      worse to worse. In 1656 he was declared bankrupt; his house and\r\n      collections were sold, and at the age of fifty-one he found\r\n      himself homeless and penniless. He was stripped, we read, even\r\n      of his household linen, though of this, to be sure, he seems to\r\n      have had but a meagre store. In his life, as in his art, there\r\n      were heavy shadows; but the light shines out in his undaunted\r\n      perseverance. He had lived for some years with his servant,\r\n      Hendrickje Stoffels, an uneducated peasant, who served him as a\r\n      model, and whose homely features appear in many of the pictures\r\n      of his middle period (_see e.g._ No. 54). In 1654 Rembrandt had\r\n      been summoned before the elders of the Church on account of the\r\n      irregularity of their relationship. But Hendrickje was a good\r\n      mother to Rembrandt's legitimate children as well as to her\r\n      own, and in 1660 she and the painter's son, Titus, entered into\r\n      partnership as art dealers, and supported Rembrandt by the sale\r\n      of his etchings. His vogue as a painter had by this time been\r\n      eclipsed by the popularity of painters of less sombre genius.\r\n      Fallen from his rich estate and frowned upon by the Church, the\r\n      master found himself in the last period of his life deserted\r\n      and unhonoured. Yet to this period belong many of his noblest\r\n      works. \"He had never cared,\" says M. Michel, \"for the suffrages\r\n      of the crowd. He set his face more steadily than ever towards\r\n      the goal he had marked out for himself. Within the walls of\r\n      his makeshift studios, seeking solace in work and meditation,\r\n      he lived for his art more absolutely than before; and some\r\n      of his creations of this period have a poetry and a depth\r\n      of expression such as he had never hitherto achieved.\" But\r\n      fresh sorrows descended upon the master as the end drew near.\r\n      Hendrickje died about 1664, and this blow was followed in 1668\r\n      by the death of Titus. Crushed in spirit and broken by poverty,\r\n      the old painter did not long survive his son. He died in\r\n      1669--unknown, unrecorded, and dishonoured. Gerard de Lairesse,\r\n      then at the height of his reputation, said of him only that he\r\n      was a master \"who merely achieved an effect of rottenness,\"\r\n      and was \"capable of nothing but vulgar and prosaic subjects.\"\r\n      Now, two centuries and a quarter after his death, Rembrandt's\r\n      fame stands higher than even in the heyday of his success. His\r\n      work as a painter is represented in the National Gallery by\r\n      several masterpieces. Of his drawings and etchings the British\r\n      Museum possesses a splendid collection; an exhibition of these\r\n      (illustrated by an admirable Catalogue) was arranged in 1899.\r\n\r\nA _tour de force_ in the artist's speciality of contrasts of light and\r\nshade. Notice how a succession of these contrasts gradually renders the\r\nsubject intelligible. \"The eye falls at once upon the woman, who is\r\ndressed in white, passes then to the figure of Christ, which next to\r\nher is the most strongly lighted--and so on to Peter, to the Pharisees,\r\nto the soldiers, till at length it perceives in the mysterious gloom of\r\nthe Temple the High Altar, with the worshippers on the steps\" (Waagen:\r\n_Treasures of Art in Great Britain_, i. 353). \"Beyond the ordinary\r\nclaims of art, this picture commands our attention from the grand\r\nconception of the painter, who here, as in other pictures and etchings,\r\nhas invested Christ with a majestic dignity which recalls Leonardo and\r\nno other\" (J. F. White).\r\n\r\nThis picture, which was painted in 1644 for Jan Six, the well-known\r\npatron of Rembrandt, passed eventually into the possession of Mr.\r\nAngerstein. The poet Wordsworth, describing a visit he paid to the\r\nAngerstein collection, wrote to Sir George Beaumont in 1808: \"Coleridge\r\nand I availed ourselves of your letters to Lawrence, and saw Mr.\r\nAngerstein's pictures. The day was very unfavourable, not a gleam\r\nof sun, and the clouds were quite in disgrace. The great picture of\r\nMichael Angelo and Sebastian (No. 1) pleased me more than ever. The new\r\nRembrandt has, I think, much, very much, in it to admire, but still\r\nmore to _wonder at_ rather than admire. I have seen many pictures of\r\nRembrandt which I should prefer to it. The light in the _depth_ of the\r\ntemple is far the finest part of it: indeed, it is the only part of\r\nthe picture which gives me very _high_ pleasure; but that does highly\r\nplease me\" (_Memorials of Coleorton_, ii. 49).\r\n\r\n\r\n46. THE BLESSINGS OF PEACE\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See_ 38.\r\n\r\nThis picture was presented in 1630 to King Charles I. by Rubens,\r\nwhen he came to England as accredited ambassador for the purpose\r\nof negotiating a peace with Spain. After the death of Charles, the\r\nParliament sold the picture for £100. It passed into the possession\r\nof the Doria family at Genoa, where it was known as \"The Family of\r\nRubens.\" It was afterwards bought by the Marquis of Stafford for £3000,\r\nand by him presented to the National Gallery.[80]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which the picture was painted gave the clue to\r\nits meaning. Rubens came to urge Charles to conclude peace, and here\r\non canvas he sets forth its blessings. In the centre of the picture is\r\nthe Goddess of _Wisdom_, with Minerva's helmet on her head, her right\r\nhand resting on her spear, now to be used no more. Before her flies\r\n_War_, reluctantly, as if he dared not resist Wisdom, yet employing\r\nhis shield, in order still to shelter _Discord_, with her torch now\r\nextinguished. Last of all in the hateful train is _Malice_, whose\r\nvery breath is fire, and who \"endeth foul in many a snaky fold\"--in\r\nthe serpent's folds, which ever attend the hostilities of nations.\r\nBeneath Minerva's protection sits _Peace_ enthroned, and gives the milk\r\nof human kindness for babes to suck. From above, Zephyrus, the soft\r\nwarm wind, descends with the olive wreath--the emblem in all ages of\r\npublic peace, whilst at her side stands the \"all-bounteous Pan,\" with\r\nAmalthea's storied Horn of _Plenty_. A band of happy children, led by\r\n_Love_ (whose torch, now that Discord's is gone out, burns aloft),\r\napproach to taste the sweets of Peace, and to minister to abundance.\r\nIn the train of Plenty comes _Opulence_, bringing goblets, wreaths\r\nof pearl, and other treasures; whilst behind is _Music_, playing on\r\nher tambourine to celebrate the arts of peace. Last of all in the\r\nforeground is a leopard, not hurting or destroying any more, but\r\nplayful as a lamb--\r\n\r\n    All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail;\r\n    Returning Justice lift aloft her scale;\r\n    Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,\r\n    And white-rob'd Innocence from heaven descend....\r\n    No more shall nation against nation rise,\r\n    Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes....\r\n    The lambs with wolves shall graze the verdant mead,\r\n    And boys in flowery bands the tiger lead.\r\n\r\n  POPE: _Messiah_.\r\n\r\n\r\n47. THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45.\r\n\r\nA characteristic piece of \"Bible by candle-light.\" There is, however,\r\nsomething spiritually instructive, as well as technically skilful,\r\nin the way in which such light there is all proceeds from Him who\r\ncame to be the light of the world: compared with this divine light\r\nthat in the lantern of the shepherds pales and is ineffectual. The\r\npicture is dated 1646. For the most part, however, the picture is a\r\npiece of pure realism, which may be contrasted in an instructive way\r\nwith the essentially religious art of earlier schools. Here there is\r\nlittle, if any, symbolism, and \"the decorative qualities with which\r\na painter like Botticelli appealed to the imagination to heighten\r\nthe impressiveness of the story have vanished also. In their stead\r\nwe have pure naturalism,--naturalism of a very refined and cultured\r\norder, which appeals to the imagination as powerfully, but in a\r\ntotally different way. The charm of the picture is independent of any\r\nexegetical qualities. Rembrandt treats the Nativity as a natural event,\r\nin a scientific spirit. The only connection between this picture and\r\nreligious art is that it represents certain conventional attributes\r\nwhich are common to both. But just so much as we subtract from it as\r\nan exponent of strictly religious thought, just so much must we add to\r\nit as appealing to the intellect in general; its impressiveness, its\r\nsublimity, and its suggestiveness, and it has all these, are evolved\r\nout of the phenomena of natural effects by a poetical process\" (J. E.\r\nHodgson, R.A., in _Magazine of Art_, 1890, p. 42).\r\n\r\n\r\n48. LANDSCAPE, WITH TOBIAS AND THE ANGEL.\r\n\r\n  _Domenichino_ (Eclectic-Bologna, 1581-1641).\r\n\r\n      Domenico Zampieri, called Domenichino for his small stature,\r\n      was born at Bologna, the son of a shoemaker. He entered the\r\n      school of the Carracci, and afterwards was invited to Rome\r\n      by Albani, in whose house he lived. Here he soon acquired\r\n      a great reputation, and was taken by Annibale Carracci as\r\n      assistant in the execution of the frescoes of the Farnese\r\n      Palace. The Cardinals Borghese and Aldobrandini were also among\r\n      his patrons. In 1617 he revisited Bologna, where he married.\r\n      In 1621 he was recalled to Rome by the Pope Gregory XV., who\r\n      appointed him principal painter and architect to the pontifical\r\n      palace. Some of the villas at Frascati were designed by him.\r\n      In 1630 he was invited to Naples to decorate the Cappella del\r\n      Tesoro of the Duomo, a commission which Guido Reni sought in\r\n      vain. Here Domenichino incurred the hostility of the Neapolitan\r\n      painters, and the machinations of the notorious triumvirate,\r\n      the \"Cabal of Naples,\" were suspected of causing his death.\r\n      At Rome also he had been much persecuted by rival artists.\r\n      Accusations of plagiarism were levelled at him, and his more\r\n      pushing competitors \"decried him to such a degree that he\r\n      was long destitute of all commissions.\" It is interesting\r\n      to contrast the conditions of (literally) \"cut-throat\r\n      competition,\" under which the Italian painters of the decadence\r\n      worked, with the Guild System of the Flemish and the honourable\r\n      time and piece-work of the earlier Italians.\r\n\r\n      The varying fortunes of Domenichino's fame form a curious\r\n      chapter in the history of taste. In his own time and down to\r\n      the end of the eighteenth century he was ranked among the\r\n      greatest masters. Poussin placed him next to Raphael. Bellori\r\n      attributed to him \"the same wand which belongs to the poetical\r\n      enchanters.\" Sir Joshua Reynolds speaks of him with high\r\n      respect, and Lanzi describes him as the admiration of all\r\n      professors, and records the enormous price which his pictures\r\n      still fetched (1809). Against these panegyrics we may set\r\n      Ruskin's invectives. \"I once supposed,\" he says, \"that there\r\n      was some life in the landscape of Domenichino, but in this I\r\n      must have been wrong. The man who painted the 'Madonna del\r\n      Rosario' and 'Martyrdom of St. Agnes' in the gallery of Bologna\r\n      is palpably incapable of doing anything good, great, or right,\r\n      in any field, way, or kind whatsoever.... Whatever appears\r\n      good in any of the doings of such a painter must be deceptive,\r\n      and we may be assured that our taste is corrupted and false\r\n      whenever we feel disposed to admire him.... I am prepared to\r\n      support this position, however uncharitable it may seem; a\r\n      man may be tempted into a gross sin by passion and forgiven,\r\n      and yet there are some kinds of sins into which only men of\r\n      a certain kind can be tempted, and which cannot be forgiven.\r\n      It should be added, however, that the artistical qualities\r\n      of these pictures are in every way worthy of the conceptions\r\n      they realise; I do not recollect any instance of colour or\r\n      execution so coarse and feelingless.\" Domenichino and the\r\n      Carraccis were, says Ruskin elsewhere, mere \"art-weeds.\" \"Their\r\n      landscape, which may in few words be accurately described as\r\n      'scum of Titian,' possesses no single merit, nor any ground\r\n      for the forgiveness of demerit.\" \"The flight of Domenichino's\r\n      angels is a sprawl paralysed.\" \"They are peculiarly offensive,\r\n      studies of bare-legged children howling and kicking in volumes\r\n      of smoke\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch.\r\n      vii. § 13; vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. v. § 17; vol. iii.\r\n      pt. iv. ch. xviii. § 20; _Stones of Venice_, travellers'\r\n      edition, vol. ii. ch. vi.; _On the Old Road_, vol. i. § 91).\r\n      Ruskin's estimate, \"though expressed with such a clangour of\r\n      emphasis,\" yet fairly represents, as Mr. Symonds says, the\r\n      feeling of modern students. Perhaps, however, the reaction\r\n      against the once worshipped pictures of Domenichino has gone\r\n      too far. His celebrated \"Diana and her Nymphs\" in the Borghese\r\n      Gallery is \"a charming picture,\" says Morelli, \"worthy of a\r\n      purer period of art. Full of cheerful animation and naïve\r\n      and delightful details, it cannot fail to please\" (_Roman\r\n      Galleries_, p. 228). Of the moral obliquity which Ruskin seems\r\n      to impute, Domenichino must be acquitted. He appears to have\r\n      been a simple, modest, painstaking, and virtuous person. \"He\r\n      was misled by his dramatic bias, and also by the prevalent\r\n      religious temper of his age. That he belonged to a school which\r\n      was essentially vulgar in its choice of type, to a city never\r\n      distinguished for delicacy of taste, and to a generation which\r\n      was rapidly losing the sense of artistic reserve, suffices\r\n      to explain the crude brutality of the conceptions which he\r\n      formed of tragic episodes\" (Symonds, _Renaissance_, vii. 220).\r\n      Lanzi says with truth that Domenichino's style of painting\r\n      is \"almost theatrical.\" He tears the passion of his figures\r\n      to tatters--\"exaggerated action destroying,\" as Ruskin says,\r\n      \"all appearance of intense feeling.\" An interesting tale is\r\n      told of the way in which the artist worked himself up. He was\r\n      engaged on a scene of martyrdom, and \"in painting one of the\r\n      executioners he actually threw himself into a passion, using\r\n      threatening words and actions.

THE PORTRAIT OF RUBENS.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641).\r\n\r\n      Sir Anthony Van Dyck, the prince of court portrait-painters\r\n      and the most famous of Rubens's pupils, is one of the many\r\n      great artists whose gifts showed themselves almost from birth.\r\n      He was born at Antwerp, the seventh child of a tradesman in\r\n      good circumstances. His mother was a woman of taste, who\r\n      attained considerable skill in art-needlework, and from her\r\n      he doubtless derived many of the qualities for which his\r\n      works are conspicuous. At the age of ten the boy had already\r\n      begun to paint. His admission at the age of thirteen to the\r\n      crowded studio of Rubens is a proof of his precocious talent.\r\n      Documents recently discovered show that Van Dyck when seventeen\r\n      had already pupils of his own, and that his independent work\r\n      was sought after by artists and amateurs. At nineteen he was\r\n      admitted to the painters' Guild of St. Luke. For five years\r\n      (1620-25) he was for the most part travelling and painting\r\n      in Italy, with introductions from Rubens. Many of his best\r\n      works are still to be seen in Genoa and Turin. He also visited\r\n      Venice, where the spell of Titian's genius enchanted him.\r\n      Several sketches in the British Museum testify to his devout\r\n      study of the great Venetian. On his return to Antwerp at the\r\n      end of 1625, Van Dyck soon became the great court-painter of\r\n      his time. Queens visited him in his studio, and the nobility\r\n      of three nations considered it an honour to be painted by him.\r\n      Religious pictures were also produced by him at this time\r\n      with amazing rapidity. In 1632 he came to England. He had\r\n      already paid a short visit in 1620-21, when he had painted\r\n      James I., and was in receipt of a grant from the Exchequer\r\n      \"for special service performed for His Majesty.\" This first\r\n      visit to England seems to have been due to the initiative\r\n      of the celebrated connoisseur, the Earl of Arundel. At the\r\n      court of Charles I. Van Dyck came at once into the highest\r\n      favour. Sir Kenelm Digby, a gentleman of the bedchamber, was\r\n      his bosom friend, and on his first presentation to Charles I.\r\n      he obtained permission to paint the king and queen. He was\r\n      appointed painter to the court, was knighted, and received a\r\n      pension of £200. A town-house was given him at Blackfriars,\r\n      and a country-house at Eltham. He \"always went magnificently\r\n      dressed, had a numerous and gallant equipage, and kept so good\r\n      a table in his apartment that few princes were more visited\r\n      or better served.\" In England alone there are said to be\r\n      twenty-four portraits of the king by Van Dyck, and twenty-five\r\n      of Queen Henrietta Maria. Every one of distinction desired to\r\n      have his or her features immortalised by the court-painter,\r\n      and for seven years he worked at the portraits of the English\r\n      aristocracy with indefatigable industry. Some 300 of these\r\n      portraits exist in this country. The painter's health gradually\r\n      began to fail, from the constant drain upon his strength\r\n      caused by the incessant labour necessary to procure the means\r\n      of gratifying his luxurious tastes, and also by his irregular\r\n      mode of life. Van Dyck, says Mr. Law in his Catalogue of the\r\n      Hampton Court Gallery, \"loved beauty in every form, and found\r\n      the seduction of female charms altogether irresistible.\" In\r\n      1639 he married Mary Ruthven, grand-daughter of the unfortunate\r\n      Lord Ruthven, Earl of Gowrie--a marriage promoted by the king,\r\n      who hoped thereby to effect a change in the painter's habits\r\n      of life. Margaret Lemon, the celebrated beauty, who lived with\r\n      Van Dyck for some time at Blackfriars, resented the marriage\r\n      most bitterly, and tried to maim the painter's right hand. In\r\n      1640-41 he travelled abroad with his wife, but returned to\r\n      this country a dying man. The king offered a special reward to\r\n      any doctor who could save the painter's life; but he expired\r\n      in his house at Blackfriars on December 9, 1641, at the early\r\n      age of forty-two. Two days afterwards he was buried in the old\r\n      cathedral of St. Paul's, and the king erected a monument to\r\n      record the death of one \"who in life had conferred immortality\r\n      on many.\" A magnificent collection of his works was shown at\r\n      the Royal Academy in the winter exhibition of 1900.\r\n\r\n      The characteristics of Van Dyck's art may in large measure be\r\n      gathered from the circumstances of his life. He is essentially\r\n      the painter of princes. His sacred and other subject pictures\r\n      are often remarkable for force and vigour of handling.\r\n      \"Van Dyck,\" says Ruskin, \"often gives a graceful dramatic\r\n      rendering of received Scriptural legends.\" But it is not in\r\n      these subjects that Van Dyck is seen in his most interesting\r\n      and most characteristic manner. \"Rubens is only to be seen in\r\n      the Battle of the Amazons, and Van Dyck only at court.\" No\r\n      more in him than in the other later Flemish artists is there\r\n      anything spiritual. The difference between him and Teniers, for\r\n      instance, is accidental rather than essential. \"They lived,\"\r\n      says Ruskin, \"the gentle at court, the simple in the pot-house;\r\n      and could indeed paint, according to their habitation, a\r\n      nobleman or a boor, but were not only incapable of conceiving,\r\n      but wholly unwishful to conceive, anything, natural or\r\n      supernatural, beyond the precincts of the Presence and the\r\n      tavern.\" What distinguishes Van Dyck is the indelible mark of\r\n      courtly grace and refinement which he gives to all his sitters.\r\n      Nowhere clearer than in his portraits does one see the better\r\n      side of the \"Cavalier\" ideal. In this connection we may note\r\n      Van Dyck's feeling for the nobility of the horse (_see_ note\r\n      on No. 156). One thing \"that gives nobleness to the Van Dyck,\"\r\n      says Ruskin in describing one of his \"cavalier\" portraits, \"is\r\n      its feminineness; the rich, light silken scarf, the flowing\r\n      hair, the delicate, sharp, though sunburnt features, and the\r\n      lace collar, do not in the least diminish the manliness,\r\n      but add feminineness. One sees that the knight is indeed a\r\n      soldier, but not a soldier only; that he is accomplished in all\r\n      ways, and tender in all thoughts.\" The reader who remembers\r\n      any large collection of Van Dycks will feel that the spirit\r\n      of Ruskin's description is true to a very large number of\r\n      them. One may forget the individual sitter; the impression\r\n      left by the Van Dyck type is indelible. Charles I. and his\r\n      Queen, though painted by several other painters, are known to\r\n      posterity exclusively through Van Dyck--not (says M. Hymans)\r\n      from a greater closeness of resemblance to the original, but\r\n      from a particular power of expression and bearing, which, once\r\n      seen, it is impossible to forget. The same may be said of Van\r\n      Dyck's portraits generally. He endowed all his sitters alike\r\n      with the same distinction of feature and elegance in bearing.\r\n      He excelled in giving delicacy to the hands, and is said to\r\n      have kept special models for this part of his work. He is not\r\n      what is called an \"intimate\" portrait painter. He does not\r\n      startle us with penetration in seizing points of individual\r\n      character; he charms us with the refinement of his type.\r\n      \"In Titian,\" says Ruskin, \"it is always the Man whom we see\r\n      first; in Van Dyck the Prince or the Sir.\" With regard to Van\r\n      Dyck's technique, his earlier productions (says Sir F. Burton)\r\n      \"are scarcely to be distinguished from those of Rubens, and\r\n      there are cases in which dogmatism as to authorship would be\r\n      hazardous.[81] Differentiation is first visible in a greater\r\n      precision, a slenderer, it might be said, a more wiry touch,\r\n      and a cooler colouring, on the part of the pupil.\" At its\r\n      worst, Van Dyck's touch is distinguished by what Ruskin calls\r\n      a certain \"flightiness and flimsiness\"; at its best, by great\r\n      refinement: \"there is not a touch of Van Dyck's pencil but he\r\n      seems to have revelled in--not grossly, but delicately--tasting\r\n      the colour in every touch as an epicure would wine.\" His\r\n      output was prodigious; in spite of his early death more than\r\n      1000 works are attributed to him. A considerable portion of\r\n      many of these was done by assistants, and his later works\r\n      are often hasty and careless. The references to Van Dyck in\r\n      Ruskin's books are numerous. (The most interesting are _Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. §§ 5, 10, 22; ch. vii. § 23;\r\n      _Elements of Drawing_, appendix ii.; _On the Old Road_, i. §\r\n      154; _Art of England_, 1884, pp. 43, 83, 138, 212.)\r\n\r\nA portrait of special interest as having been much prized by Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds, to whom it formerly belonged. When Mr. Angerstein bought\r\nit, the great Burke is said to have congratulated him on possessing\r\nSir Joshua's \"favourite picture.\" It is commonly called \"The Portrait\r\nof Rubens,\" but the principal figure does not greatly resemble the\r\nwell-known face of Rubens; it is more probably a portrait of Luke\r\nVostermann, a celebrated engraver of the time. He is discoursing, it\r\nwould seem, on some point of art, suggested by the little statue which\r\na man behind is holding.\r\n\r\n\r\n50. ST. AMBROSE AND THEODOSIUS.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See under last picture._\r\n\r\nA copy, with some variations, of a large picture by Rubens now at\r\nVienna. The subject is that described by Gibbon (ch. xxvii.). The\r\nEmperor Theodosius, for a massacre of the inhabitants of Thessalonica,\r\nwas excommunicated by Ambrose, the Archbishop of Milan.\r\n\r\n      The emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches, and\r\n      by those of his spiritual father; and, after he had bewailed\r\n      the mischievous and irreparable consequences of his own rash\r\n      fury, he proceeded, in the accustomed manner, to perform his\r\n      devotions in the great church of Milan. He was stayed in the\r\n      porch by the Archbishop; who, in the tone and language of an\r\n      ambassador of heaven, declared to his sovereign that private\r\n      contrition was not sufficient to atone for a public fault, or\r\n      to appease the justice of an offended Deity. Theodosius humbly\r\n      represented that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide,\r\n      David, the man after God's own heart, had been guilty not\r\n      only of murder, but of adultery. \"You have imitated David in\r\n      his crime, imitate then his repentance,\" was the reply of the\r\n      undaunted Ambrose.\r\n\r\nObserve as an instance of picturesque ornament properly introduced\r\nin subordination to the figure subject, the robes of St. Ambrose.\r\n\"Tintoret, Titian, Veronese, Rubens, and Van Dyck would be very sorry\r\nto part with their figured stuffs and lustrous silks; and sorry,\r\nobserve, exactly in the degree of their picturesque feeling. Should\r\nnot _we_ also be sorry to have Bishop Ambrose without his vest in that\r\npicture of the National Gallery? But I think Van Dyck would not have\r\nliked, on the other hand, the vest without the bishop. And I much doubt\r\nif Titian or Veronese would have enjoyed going into Waterloo House, and\r\nmaking studies of dresses upon the counters\" (_Stones of Venice_, vol.\r\ni. ch. xx. § 13).\r\n\r\n\r\n51. A JEW MERCHANT.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45.\r\n\r\nOne of the \"heads of the people\" whom Rembrandt saw around him; for the\r\nstreet in which he lived at Amsterdam swarmed with Dutch and Portuguese\r\nJews. \"In rendering human character, such as he saw about him,\r\nRembrandt is nearly equal to Correggio, Titian, Tintoret, Veronese,\r\nor Velazquez; and the real power of him is in his stern and steady\r\ntouch on lip and brow,--seen best in his lightest etchings,--or in the\r\nlightest parts of the handling of his portraits, the head of the Jew in\r\nour own Gallery being about as good and thorough work as it is possible\r\nto see of his\" (_Academy Notes_, 1859, p. 52).\r\n\r\n\r\n52. \"PORTRAIT OF GEVARTIUS.\"\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See_ 49.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated pictures in the Gallery. The title by\r\nwhich it is commonly known is incorrect; the sitter being not Gaspar\r\nGevarts or Gevartius, but Cornelius van der Geest, an amateur of the\r\narts and a friend of Rubens and Van Dyck. It is the grave learning of\r\na scholar, the gentle refinement of an artist--notice especially \"the\r\nliquid, living lustre of the eye\"--that Van Dyck here puts before us.\r\nIn point of execution this picture ranks as one of the finest portraits\r\nin the world. \"From it,\" says Mr. Watts, R.A., \"the modern student\r\nwill learn more than from any I am acquainted with. The eyes,\" he\r\nadds, \"are miracles of drawing and painting. They are a little tired\r\nand overworked, and do not so much _see_ anything as indicate the\r\nthoughtful brain behind. How wonderful the flexible mouth! with the\r\nlight shining through the sparse moustache. How tremulously yet firmly\r\npainted. The ear: how set on ... so throughout there is no part of\r\nthis wonderful portrait that might not be examined and enlarged upon;\r\nbut I would ask my fellow-students to do this for themselves. Not a\r\ntouch is put in for what is understood by 'effect.' Dexterous in a\r\nsuperlative degree, there is not in the ordinary sense a dexterous dab\r\ndoing duty for honourable serious work: nothing done to look well at\r\none distance or another, but to be right at every distance\" (_Magazine\r\nof Art_, June 1889). Sir Edward Poynter is equally enthusiastic. \"This\r\nwonderful portrait,\" he says, \"is perhaps the most perfect head ever\r\npainted by this consummate painter. Not only for the brilliancy and\r\npurity of its flesh tints, the masterly drawing, and the vitality of\r\nthe expression, does it rank as one of the masterpieces of portraiture\r\nexisting; but for the brushwork, of which every touch expresses with\r\nsupreme dexterity all the varieties of form, substance, and texture,\r\nit is unsurpassed, perhaps unrivalled, in the history of painting\"\r\n(_National Gallery_, i. 152). Another P.R.A., Benjamin West, copied the\r\n\"Gevartius,\" and at this day there is no picture in the Gallery more\r\noften copied by students.[82] Their preference is justified by that\r\nof the painter himself, who \"used to consider it his masterpiece, and\r\nbefore he had gained his great reputation carried it about with him\r\nfrom court to court, and patron to patron, to show what he could do as\r\na portrait painter.\"[83]\r\n\r\n\r\n53. AN EVENING LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Albert Cuyp_ (Dutch: 1620-1691).\r\n\r\n      Cuyp was born at Dort--the son of an artist who was one of the\r\n      founders of the Painters' Guild in that town. He was a deacon\r\n      and elder of his church, and was a citizen of importance,\r\n      holding various municipal and judicial offices. As a painter,\r\n      however, he had little reputation in his own country, and,\r\n      as is the case with so many of the Dutch masters, it was in\r\n      England that he was first appreciated. Even in 1750 one of\r\n      his pictures sold for thirty florins; in 1876 one fetched\r\n      at Christie's £5040. The high esteem in which his works are\r\n      thus held is justified alike by their own merits and by his\r\n      important position in the history of landscape art. He is, in\r\n      the first place, the principal master of pastoral landscape,\r\n      \"representing peasant life and its daily work, or such scenery\r\n      as may naturally be suggestive of it, consisting usually of\r\n      simple landscape, in part subjected to agriculture, with\r\n      figures, cattle, and domestic buildings.\" In this respect Cuyp\r\n      is an interesting case of the detachment of an artist's life.\r\n      He was born and lived in troublous times; but in looking at his\r\n      works one would imagine (it has been said) \"that he passed his\r\n      whole life in Arcadia, untroubled by any more anxious thought\r\n      than whether the sun would give the effect which he required\r\n      for his paintings, or the cows stay long enough for him to\r\n      depict them in their natural attitudes.\" Dwelling on the banks\r\n      of the placid Maas, he delighted also to reproduce the warm\r\n      skies of summer or autumn reflected in an expanse of water\r\n      overspread with marine craft. Secondly, Cuyp has been called\r\n      the \"Dutch Claude,\" for he was the first amongst the Dutch to\r\n      \"set the sun in the sky.\" \"For expression of effects of yellow\r\n      sunlight, parts might be chosen out of the good pictures of\r\n      Cuyp, which have never been equalled in art.\" It is sun_shine_,\r\n      observe, that Cuyp paints, not sun _colour_. \"Observe this\r\n      accurately. Those easily understood effects of afternoon light,\r\n      gracious and sweet so far as they reach, are produced by the\r\n      softly warm or yellow rays of the sun falling through mist.\r\n      They are low in tone, even in nature, and disguise the colours\r\n      of objects. They are imitable even by persons who have little\r\n      or no gift of colour, if the tones of the picture are kept\r\n      low and in true harmony, and the reflected lights warm. But\r\n      they never could be painted by great colourists. The fact of\r\n      blue and crimson being effaced by yellow and grey puts such\r\n      effect at once out of the notice or thought of a colourist.\"\r\n      The task of painting the sun _colour_ was reserved for Turner;\r\n      yet Cuyp's pictures had a great influence over him.\" He went\r\n      steadily through the subdued golden chord, and painted Cuyp's\r\n      favourite effect, 'sun rising through vapour,' for many a weary\r\n      year. But this was not enough for him. He must paint the sun in\r\n      his strength, the sun rising _not_ through vapour. If you turn\r\n      to the Apollo in the 'Ulysses and Polyphemus' (508), his horses\r\n      are rising beyond the horizon--you see he is not 'rising\r\n      through vapour,' but above it;--gaining somewhat of a victory\r\n      over vapour, it appears. The old Dutch brewer,[84] with his\r\n      yellow mist, was a great man and a good guide, but he was not\r\n      Apollo. He and his dray-horses led the way through the flats\r\n      cheerily, for a little time; we have other horses now flaming\r\n      out 'beyond the mighty sea'\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt.\r\n      ii. sec. ii. ch. i. § 19; vol. v. pt. ix. ch. xi. §§ 3, 4).\r\n      Admirers of Cuyp should make a point of visiting the Dulwich\r\n      Gallery, which is peculiarly rich in works by this master. In\r\n      the British Museum are several of his drawings and studies.\r\n\r\nAn interesting study in what is called \"truth of tone\" may be made with\r\nthis picture--by which is meant the \"exact relation and fitness of\r\nshadow and light, and of the hues of all objects under them; and more\r\nespecially that precious quality of each colour laid on which makes it\r\nappear a quiet colour illuminated, not a bright colour in shade.\" Now\r\nwith regard to this Ruskin says, \"I much doubt if there be a single\r\n_bright_ Cuyp in the world, which, taken as a whole, does not present\r\nmany glaring solecisms in tone. I have not seen many fine pictures\r\nof his which were not utterly spoiled by the vermilion dress of some\r\nprincipal figure--a vermilion totally unaffected and unwarmed by the\r\ngolden hue of the rest of the picture; and, what is worse, with little\r\ndistinction between its own illumined and shaded parts, so that it\r\nappears altogether out of sunshine--the colour of a bright vermilion\r\nin dead, cold daylight.... And these failing parts, though they often\r\nescape the eye when we are near the picture and able to dwell upon what\r\nis beautiful in it, yet so injure its whole effect that I question if\r\nthere be many Cuyps in which vivid colours occur, which will not lose\r\ntheir effect and become cold and flat at a distance of ten or twelve\r\npaces, retaining their influence only when the eye is close enough\r\nto rest on the right parts without including the whole. Take, for\r\ninstance, the large one in our National Gallery. (Seen at a distance)\r\nthe black cow appears a great deal nearer than the dogs, and the golden\r\ntones of the distance look like a sepia drawing rather than like\r\nsunshine, owing chiefly to the utter want of aerial greys indicated\r\nthrough them\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. i. §§\r\n11, 19).\r\n\r\n\r\n54. A WOMAN BATHING.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45.\r\n\r\n\"Those who have been in Holland,\" says Mrs. Jameson, \"must often\r\nhave seen the peasant girls washing their linen and trampling on it,\r\nprecisely in the manner here depicted. Rembrandt may have seen one\r\nof them from his window, and snatching up his pencil and palette, he\r\nthrew the figure on the canvas and fixed it there as by a spell.\"\r\nMore probably, however, this is one of Rembrandt's many pictures of\r\nhis servant and model, Hendrickje Stoffels. \"The finest of the whole\r\nseries,\" says M. Michel, \"is the study of Hendrickje in the National\r\nGallery, the so-called 'Woman Bathing.' It bears the date 1654, and\r\nis undoubtedly a masterpiece among Rembrandt's less important works.\r\nThe young woman, whose only garment is a chemise, stands facing the\r\nspectator, in a deep pool. Her attitude suggests a sensation of\r\npleasure and refreshment tempered by the involuntary shrinking of the\r\nbody at the first contact of the cold water. The light from above\r\nglances on her breast and forehead, and on the luxuriant disorder\r\nof her bright hair; the lower part of her face and her legs are in\r\ndeep transparent shadow. The brown tones of the soil, the landscape\r\nbackground and the water, the purple and gold of the draperies, make up\r\na marvellous setting alike for the brilliantly illuminated contour and\r\nthe more subdued carnations of the model. The truth of the impression,\r\nthe breadth of the careful but masterly execution, the variety of\r\nthe handling, proclaim the matured power of the artist, and combine\r\nto glorify the hardy grace and youthful radiance of his creation\"\r\n(_Rembrandt: his Life, his Work, and his Time_, ii. 70).\r\n\r\n\r\n55. THE DEATH OF PROCRIS (_see under_ 698).\r\n\r\n  _Claude_ (French: 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\n\"A most pathetic picture,\" says Constable (who made a copy of it\r\nwhen it was in Sir George Beaumont's possession). \"The expression of\r\nCephalus is very touching; and, indeed, nothing can be finer than the\r\nway in which Claude has told that affecting story throughout. Procris\r\nhas come from her concealment to die at the feet of her husband.\r\nAbove her is a withered tree clasped by ivy, an emblem of love in\r\ndeath,--while a stag seen on the outline of a hill, over which the\r\nrising sun spreads his rays, explains the cause of a fatal mistake....\r\nIt is the fashion to find fault with his figures indiscriminately,\r\nyet in his best time they are so far from being objectionable that we\r\ncannot easily imagine anything else according so well with his scenes;\r\nas objects of colour they seem indispensable. Wilson said to a friend\r\nwho was talking of them in the usual manner, 'Do not fall into the\r\ncommon mistake of objecting to Claude's figures'\" (Leslie's _Life of\r\nConstable_, 1845, p. 339).\r\n\r\n\r\n56.

A STUDY OF TREES.\r\n\r\n  _Claude_ (French: 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\nThis picture, when in Sir George Beaumont's collection at Coleorton,\r\nwas copied by Constable and called by him \"The Little Grove.\" In 1823\r\nConstable wrote to a friend, \"I have likewise begun 'The Little Grove'\r\nby Claude; a noonday scene 'which warms and cheers, but which does\r\nnot inflame or irritate.' Through the depths of the trees are seen a\r\nwaterfall and a ruined temple, and a solitary shepherd is piping to\r\nsome goats and sheep:--\r\n\r\n    'In closing shades and where the current strays,\r\n    Pipes the lone shepherd to his feeding flocks.'\"\r\n\r\n(Leslie's _Life of Constable_, 1845, p. 119.)\r\n\r\n\r\n59. THE BRAZEN SERPENT.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See_ 38.\r\n\r\n\"It is interesting to observe the difference in the treatment of\r\nthis subject by the three great masters, Michael Angelo, Rubens,\r\nand Tintoret.... Rubens and Michael Angelo made the fiery serpents\r\nhuge boa-constrictors, and knotted the sufferers together with them.\r\nTintoret makes ... the serpents little flying and fluttering monsters,\r\nlike lampreys with wings; and the children of Israel, instead of being\r\nthrown into convulsed and writhing groups, are scattered, fainting in\r\nthe fields, far away in the distance. As usual, Tintoret's conception,\r\nwhile thoroughly characteristic of himself, is also truer to the words\r\nof Scripture. We are told that 'the Lord sent fiery serpents among the\r\npeople, and they _bit_ the people'; we are not told that they crushed\r\nthe people to death. And, while thus the truest, it is also the most\r\nterrific conception.... Our instinct tells us that boa-constrictors do\r\nnot come in armies; and we look upon the picture with as little emotion\r\nas upon the handle of a vase, or any other form worked out of serpents,\r\nwhen there is no probability of serpents actually occurring\" (_Stones\r\nof Venice_: Venetian Index, \"Rocco, Scuola di San,\" No. 24).\r\n\r\n\r\n61. LANDSCAPE WITH FIGURES.\r\n\r\n  _Claude_ (French: 1600-1682). _See_ 2.\r\n\r\nThe history of this picture is curiously interesting. It belonged to\r\nSir George Beaumont, who valued it so highly that it was, we are told,\r\nhis travelling companion. He presented it to the National Gallery in\r\n1826, but unable to bear its loss begged it back for the rest of his\r\nlife. He took it with him into the country, and on his death, two years\r\nlater, his widow restored it to the nation. Sir George Beaumont was not\r\nthe only artist who thought highly of this little picture. Constable,\r\nwe are told, \"looked back on the first sight of this exquisite work as\r\nan important epoch in his life.... It is called _The Annunciation_; but\r\nthe spring by which the female is seated, and the action of the angel\r\nwho points to the buildings in the distance, leave little doubt that\r\nClaude's intention was to represent the first flight of Hagar from the\r\npresence of her mistress\" (Leslie's _Life of Constable_, 1845, p. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n62. A BACCHANALIAN DANCE.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Poussin_ (French: 1593-1665). _See_ 39.\r\n\r\nThis picture, one of Poussin's masterpieces, is probably one of four\r\nBacchanals painted for Cardinal Richelieu:--\r\n\r\n    Whence came ye, jolly Satyrs! whence came ye,\r\n    So many, and so many, and such glee?\r\n    Why have ye left your forest haunts, why left\r\n        Your nuts in oak-tree cleft?--\r\n    \"For wine, for wine we left our kernel tree;\r\n    For wine we left our heath, and yellow brooms,\r\n        And cold mushrooms;\r\n    For wine we follow Bacchus through the earth;\r\n    Great god of breathless cups and chirping mirth!\r\n    Come hither, lady fair, and joined be\r\n        To our mad minstrelsy!\"\r\n\r\n  KEATS: _Endymion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n63. LANDSCAPE WITH FIGURES.\r\n\r\n  _Annibale Carracci_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1560-1609). _See_ 9.\r\n\r\nThis picture was originally in the Giustiniani Palace at Rome; hence\r\nthe figures are supposed to represent (as stated on the frame) Prince\r\nGiustiniani and his attendants returning from the chase.\r\n\r\n\r\n64. RETURN OF THE ARK FROM CAPTIVITY.\r\n\r\n  _Sebastien Bourdon_ (French: 1616-1671).\r\n\r\nThis picture was a great favourite with Sir Joshua Reynolds, to whom\r\nit once belonged. He cited it, together with a picture by Salvator\r\nRosa, to the students of the Academy (Discourse xiv.) as an instance\r\nof the \"poetical style of landscape,\" calling particular attention to\r\nthe \"visionary\" character of \"the whole and every part of the scene.\"\r\nThe subject is the return of the ark by the Philistines to the valley\r\nof Bath-shemesh, as described in I Samuel vi. 10-14. The painter was\r\none of the original twelve _anciens_ of the old French Academy of\r\npainting, of which he died rector; he had formerly been painter to\r\nQueen Christina of Sweden, to whose country he had fled as a Protestant.\r\n\r\n\r\n65. CEPHALUS AND AURORA.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Poussin_ (French: 1593-1669). _See under_ 39.\r\n\r\nNone of the \"learned\" Poussin's pictures in the Gallery shows so well\r\nas this how steeped he was alike in the knowledge and in the feeling of\r\nGreek mythology. Cephalus was a Thessalian prince whose love of hunting\r\ncarried him away at early dawn from the arms of his wife Procris (see\r\nunder 698). Hence the allegorical fable of the loves of Cephalus and\r\nAurora, the goddess of the dawn, and her attempt to rival Procris in\r\nhis affections. Cephalus here half yields to Aurora's blandishments,\r\nbut a little Cupid holds up before him the portrait of his wife and\r\nrecalls her love to his mind. Behind is Aurora's car, in which she is\r\ndrawn by the white-winged Pegasus across the sky. But Pegasus, with\r\nthat intermingling of many ideas which is characteristic of all Greek\r\nmyths, is also \"the Angel of the Wild Fountains: that is to say, the\r\nfastest flying or lower rain-cloud, winged, but racing as upon the\r\nearth.\"[85] Hence beside him sleeps a river-god, his head resting on\r\nhis urn. But the mountain top is tipped with dawn; and behind, one sees\r\na Naiad waking. Farther still beyond, in a brightening horizon, the\r\nform of Apollo, the sun-god whose advent follows on the dawn, is just\r\napparent, his horses and his car melting into the shapes of morning\r\nclouds.[86]\r\n\r\n\r\n66. A LANDSCAPE: AUTUMN MORNING.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See_ 38.\r\n\r\nRubens \"perhaps furnishes us with the first instances of complete,\r\nunconventional, unaffected landscape. His treatment is healthy, manly,\r\nand rational, not very affectionate, yet often condescending to minute\r\nand multitudinous detail; always, as far as it goes, pure, forcible,\r\nand refreshing, consummate in composition, and marvellous in colour\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. § 15). Notice\r\nespecially the sky. \"The whole field of ancient landscape art affords,\r\nas far as we remember, but one instance of any effort whatever to\r\nrepresent the character of the upper cloud region. That one instance\r\nis the landscape of Rubens in our own Gallery, in which the mottled or\r\nfleecy sky is given with perfect truth and exquisite beauty\" (_ibid._,\r\nvol. i. pt. ii. sec. iii. ch. ii. § 9). Rubens's skill in landscape was\r\npartly due to fondness for the scenery he depicted. This picture was\r\npainted when he was at Genoa, but it is a purely Flemish scene--a broad\r\nstretch of his own lowlands, with the castle of Stein, it is said,\r\nwhich was afterwards his residence, near Mechlin, in the background,\r\nwith Flemish waggon and horses fording a brook, and with a sportsman in\r\nthe immediate foreground, carrying an old-fashioned firelock, intent on\r\na covey of partridges.[87] \"The Dutch painters are perfectly contented\r\nwith their flat fields and pollards; Rubens, though he had seen the\r\nAlps, usually composes his landscapes of a hayfield or two, plenty of\r\npollards and willows, a distant spire, a Dutch house with a moat about\r\nit, a windmill, and a ditch\" (_ibid._, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. xiii. §\r\n20). The Dutch painters agreed, in fact, with the Lincolnshire farmer\r\nin Kingsley's _Alton Locke_, whom Ruskin goes on to quote: \"None o'\r\nthis here darned ups and downs o' hills, to shake a body's victuals out\r\nof his inwards,\" but \"all so vlat as a barn's vloor, for vorty mile on\r\nend--there's the country to live in!\"\r\n\r\nThis picture is one of four \"seasons.\" (Spring is in the Wallace\r\ncollection at Hertford House, Summer and Winter are in the Royal\r\ncollection at Windsor.) It was presented to the nation by Sir George\r\nBeaumont. The painter Haydon, describing a visit to Sir George at\r\nColeorton, writes:\r\n\r\n\"We dined with the Claude and Rembrandt before us, breakfasted with the\r\nRubens landscape, and did nothing morning, noon, or night but think\r\nof painting, dream of painting, and wake to paint again.\" The picture\r\nis referred to also by Wordsworth in a very interesting passage.\r\n\"I heard the other day,\" he writes to Sir George Beaumont, \"of two\r\nartists, who thus expressed themselves upon the subject of a scene\r\namong our lakes: 'Plague upon those vile enclosures!' said one; 'they\r\nspoil everything.' 'Oh,' said the other, 'I never _see_ them.' Glover\r\nwas the name of this last. Now, for my part, I should not wish to be\r\neither of these gentlemen, but to have in my own mind the power of\r\nturning to advantage, wherever it is possible, every object of Art and\r\nNature as they appear before me. What a noble instance, as you have\r\npointed out to me, has Rubens given of this in that picture in your\r\npossession, where he has brought, as it were, a whole country into\r\none landscape, and made the most formal partitions of cultivation,\r\nhedgerows of pollard willows, conduct the eye into the depths and\r\ndistances of his picture: and thus, more than by any other means, has\r\ngiven it that appearance of immensity which is so striking\" (_Memorials\r\nof Coleorton_, ii. 135).\r\n\r\n\r\n67. THE HOLY FAMILY AND ST. GEORGE.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See_ 38.\r\n\r\nOn the left are the usual incidents of a \"Riposo,\" or Repose in\r\nEgypt. St. Joseph is asleep, and the mule browses on the bank of the\r\nstream, while John the Baptist and attendant angels play with the\r\nLamb. The Holy Child is on its mother's knee, and to them St. George\r\nis presenting his proselyte, the heathen princess whom he had saved\r\nfrom the dragon (see under 16). The dragon, now bridled with her\r\ngirdle, follows her meekly, and St. George, as he introduces her to the\r\nmysteries of Christianity, plants the banner of the Faith. With the\r\nholy mother is St. Mary Magdalen--a penitent sinner herself, like the\r\nheathen princess, whom she now ushers into the Holy Presence.\r\n\r\nSuch appears to be the subject. As for the manner in which it is\r\ntreated, it is interesting to know that the figures are portraits of\r\nthe painter himself and his family. Rubens \"is religious, too, after\r\nhis manner; hears mass every morning, and perpetually uses the phrase\r\n'by the grace of God,' or some other such, in writing of any business\r\nhe takes in hand; but the tone of his religion may be determined\r\nby one fact. We saw how Veronese painted himself and his family as\r\nworshipping the Madonna. Rubens has also painted himself in an equally\r\nelaborate piece.[88] But they are not _worshipping_ the Madonna. They\r\nare _performing_ the Madonna, and her saintly entourage\" (_Modern\r\nPainters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. § 9).\r\n\r\n\r\n68. A WOODY LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Gaspard Poussin_ (French: 1613-1675). _See_ 31.\r\n\r\nThe scene is the beautiful avenue of oaks, called the \"Galleria di\r\nSopra,\" which skirts the upper margin of the Lake of Albano. Ruskin\r\nrefers to this picture in illustration of his thesis that Turner's\r\n\"truth of vegetation,\" in his representation of the exceeding intricacy\r\nof nature, is not to be paralleled among the old painters, and least of\r\nall in Gaspard Poussin with his regular \"tree-patterns.\" The picture\r\nbefore us is \"a woody landscape,\" which in nature would be a mass of\r\nintricate foliage--\r\n\r\n      \"a mere confusion of points and lines between you and the\r\n      sky.... This, as it comes down into the body of the tree,\r\n      gets closer, but never opaque; it is always transparent,\r\n      with crumbling lights in it letting you through to the sky;\r\n      then, out of this, come, heavier and heavier, the masses of\r\n      illumined foliage, all dazzling and inextricable, save here\r\n      and there a single leaf on the extremities: then, under these,\r\n      you get deep passages of broken irregular gloom, passing into\r\n      transparent, green-lighted, misty hollows ... all penetrable\r\n      and transparent, and, in proportion, inextricable and\r\n      incomprehensible, except where across the labyrinth and mystery\r\n      of the dazzling light and dream-like shadow, falls, close to\r\n      us, some solitary spray, some wreath of two or three motionless\r\n      large leaves, the type and embodying of all that in the rest we\r\n      feel and imagine, but can never see.\r\n\r\n      \"Now, with thus much of nature in your mind, go to Gaspard\r\n      Poussin's 'View near Albano.' It is the very subject to unite\r\n      all these effects, a sloping bank shaded with intertwined\r\n      forest. And what has Gaspard given us? A mass of smooth,\r\n      opaque, varnished brown, without one interstice, one change\r\n      of hue, or any vestige of leafy structure, in its interior,\r\n      or in those parts of it, I should say, which are intended to\r\n      represent interior; but out of it, over it rather, at regular\r\n      intervals, we have circular groups of greenish touches,\r\n      always the same in size, shape, and distance from each other,\r\n      containing so exactly the same number of touches each, that\r\n      you cannot tell one from another. There are eight or nine and\r\n      thirty of them, laid over each other like fish-scales; the\r\n      shade being most carefully made darker and darker as it recedes\r\n      from each until it comes to the edge of the next, against\r\n      which it cuts in the same sharp circular line, and then begins\r\n      to decline again, until the canvas is covered with about as\r\n      much intelligence or feeling of art as a house-painter has in\r\n      marbling a wainscot, or a weaver in repeating an ornamental\r\n      pattern. What is there in this, which the most determined\r\n      prejudice in favour of the old masters can for a moment suppose\r\n      to resemble trees? It is exactly what the most ignorant\r\n      beginner, trying to make a complete drawing, would lay down;\r\n      exactly the conception of trees which we have in the works of\r\n      our worst drawing-masters, where the shade is laid on with\r\n      the black lead and stump, and every human power exerted to\r\n      make it look like a kitchen grate well polished\"[89] (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. vi. ch. i. §§ 16-19).\r\n\r\nA further \"untruth of vegetation\" is the perpetration of the bough at\r\nthe left-hand upper corner. This is--\r\n\r\n      \"a representation of an ornamental group of elephants'\r\n      tusks, with feathers tied to the end of them. Not the\r\n      wildest imagination could ever conjure up in it the remotest\r\n      resemblance to the bough of a tree. It might be the claws of\r\n      a witch, the talons of an eagle, the horns of a fiend; but it\r\n      is a full assemblage of every conceivable falsehood which can\r\n      be told respecting foliage, a piece of work so barbarous in\r\n      every way, that one glance at it ought to prove the complete\r\n      charlatanism and trickery of the whole system of the old\r\n      landscape painters\" (_ibid._, § 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n69. ST. JOHN PREACHING IN THE WILDERNESS.\r\n\r\n  _Pietro Francesco Mola_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1612-1668).\r\n\r\n      Mola, a native of Milan, and the son of an architect, studied\r\n      first at Rome and Venice, but afterwards at Bologna--returning\r\n      ultimately to Rome, where he held the office of President of\r\n      the Academy of St. Luke. \"There is,\" says Sir Frederic Burton,\r\n      \"a certain idyllic character in Mola's works which renders\r\n      them extremely attractive and of more artistic value than the\r\n      majority of works produced in his day.\"\r\n\r\nThe wild figure of the Baptist is well contrasted with the turbaned\r\nPharisee and the rest of his audience:--\r\n\r\n    The last, and greatest, herald of Heav'n's King,\r\n    Girt with rough skins, hies to the desert wild:\r\n    There burst he forth--\"All ye whose hopes rely\r\n    On God! with me amidst these deserts mourn;\r\n    Repent! repent! and from old errors turn.\"\r\n    Who listen'd to his voice, obey'd his cry?\r\n    Only the echoes, which he made relent,\r\n    Rung from their flinty caves--Repent!--repent!\r\n\r\n  DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN: _Flowers of Zion_.\r\n\r\nThe preacher places his right hand on his heart as if to attest his\r\nown sincerity, while with his left he points to the Saviour, who is\r\nseen approaching in the distance: \"This is he of whom I said, After me\r\ncometh a man which is preferred before me, for he was before me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n70. CORNELIA AND HER JEWELS.\r\n\r\n  _Padovanino_ (Venetian: 1590-1650).\r\n\r\n      Alessandro Varotari was born at Padua, from which town he\r\n      derived the name by which he is generally known. He was the\r\n      son of a Veronese painter, but went early to Venice, where\r\n      he became a student and imitator of the works of Titian and\r\n      Paolo Veronese. His masterpiece is the \"Marriage at Cana\" in\r\n      the Academy at Venice. He painted children well, and often\r\n      introduced them into his pictures.\r\n\r\nCornelia, a noble Roman lady, daughter of the elder Scipio Africanus,\r\nand mother of the Gracchi, was visited by a friend, who ostentatiously\r\nexhibited her jewels. Cornelia being asked to show hers in turn,\r\npointed to her two sons, just then returning from school, and said,\r\n\"These are my jewels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n71. A PARTY OF MULETEERS.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Both_ (Dutch: 1610-1662).\r\n\r\n      Jan Both, born at Utrecht, was one of the first \"Italianisers\"\r\n      in landscape. He was the son of a glass painter, who gave him\r\n      his first lessons in drawing; he afterwards became the pupil\r\n      of Abraham Bloemaert. As soon as he was old enough to travel,\r\n      he set out with his brother Andries for Italy. Unlike Rubens,\r\n      who even at Genoa painted only the Netherlands, Both adopted\r\n      Italian scenery as his subject. At Rome he formed his style on\r\n      that of Claude. The two brothers travelled, studied, and worked\r\n      in Italy together. Jan excelled in landscape; the figures and\r\n      cattle in his pictures were generally sketched by Andries.\r\n      After some years at Rome, the brothers worked for a time at\r\n      Venice; here Andries, having dined one evening not wisely but\r\n      too well, fell from his gondola into the water and was drowned.\r\n      This was a terrible blow to Jan, who returned to Utrecht in\r\n      despair, where he survived his brother for some years, during\r\n      which Poelenburgh took the place of Andries (see No. 209). In\r\n      the year 1649 Jan was one of the chiefs of the Painters' Guild\r\n      at Utrecht, and the inscription on an engraved portrait of him\r\n      published in 1662 speaks of him as a \"good and well-respected\r\n      landscape painter.\" Both loved to paint abruptly-rising rocks,\r\n      with mountain paths fringed with trees, and cascades or lakes\r\n      in the foreground. His best works are distinguished by the soft\r\n      golden tones of the declining day. Several good examples of\r\n      this master are to be seen at the Dulwich Gallery.\r\n\r\nA reminiscence, doubtless, of one of Both's journeys in the Italian\r\nlake district. One may recall the reminiscence of Italy by another\r\nnorthern traveller--\r\n\r\n    Know'st thou the mountain bridge that hangs on cloud?\r\n    The mules in mist grope o'er the torrent loud,\r\n    In caves lie coil'd the dragon's ancient brood,\r\n    The crag leaps down and over it the flood:\r\n    Know'st thou it, then?\r\n                        'Tis there! 'tis there\r\n    Our way runs; O my father, wilt thou go?\r\n\r\n  MIGNON'S song in _Wilhelm Meister_: Carlyle's translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n72. LANDSCAPE WITH TOBIAS AND THE ANGEL.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n73. THE CONVERSION OF ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Ercole di Giulio Grandi_ (Ferrarese: died 1531).\r\n\r\nThe confused character of this picture is sufficiently shown by the\r\nfact that whilst the official designation is as above, other critics\r\nhave called it the \"Destruction of Sennacherib.\" For a masterpiece\r\nby Ercole, see 1119. The ascription to him of this inferior work is\r\ndecidedly doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n74. A SPANISH PEASANT BOY.\r\n\r\n  _Murillo_ (Spanish: 1618-1682). _See_ 13.\r\n\r\nLook at this and the other little boy near it (176), and you will see\r\nat once the secret of Murillo's popularity. \"In a country like Spain\r\nhe became easily the favourite of the crowd. He was one of themselves,\r\nand had all the gifts they valued. Not like Velazquez, reproducing by\r\nchoice only the noble and dignified side of the national character,\r\nMurillo could paint to perfection either the precocious sentiment of\r\nthe Good Shepherd with the lamb by his side, or the rags and happiness\r\nof the gipsy beggar boy\" (W. B. Scott's _Murillo_, p. 76)--\r\n\r\n    Poor and content is rich and rich enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n75. ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON.\r\n\r\n  _Domenichino_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1581-1641). _See_ 48.\r\n\r\nCompare this conventional representation of the subject with the\r\nimaginative one by Tintoretto (16). Amongst points of comparison notice\r\nthe absence of anything terrible in the dragon, the crowd of spectators\r\n(on the walls in the distance), St. George's helmet; and where is his\r\nspear?\r\n\r\n\r\n76. CHRIST'S AGONY IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  _After Correggio_. _See under_ 10.\r\n\r\nThis is an old copy, or perhaps a replica, of the original picture\r\nin the possession of the Duke of Wellington at Apsley House. The\r\ntreatment of the subject is remarkable, and characteristic of\r\nCorreggio. \"The angel hovers in mid-air with marvellous ease and\r\nlightness, and though he bears the healing message of approaching\r\nbliss, he cannot restrain his sense of pity. His face is at once\r\nradiant and sorrowful, expressing the mingled feelings with which he\r\npoints on the one hand to heaven, on the other to the cross and crown\r\nof thorns. Christ, effulgent in his long straight robe and shining\r\naureole, gazes upward with mournful resignation, the spasm of agony\r\ndying out of his face. The twilight landscape is calm and melancholy.\r\nThe supernatural radiance sheds but a faint light on the grass and\r\nbushes, scarcely touching the figures of the sleeping disciples, and\r\ndying out completely in the dense foliage beyond. But in the distance\r\na band of soldiers, scarcely visible by the faint glimmer of their\r\ntorches, draws near, led by Judas, and over the mountains the sky\r\nwhitens with the first pale streak of dawn\" (Ricci: _Correggio: his\r\nLife, his Friends, and his Time_, p. 231). The effect of light,\r\nMengs points out, is peculiar: \"the radiance of the Saviour's face\r\nlights up the picture. But this radiance comes from above, as if from\r\nHeaven, while the angel is illuminated by the light reflected from\r\nthe Saviour.\" It is interesting to compare Correggio's version of the\r\nagony with the earlier one by Bellini (726) and Mantegna (1417). The\r\nearlier pictures impress us, but the manner of impression is quite\r\ndifferent. There is no attempt either in the Bellini or in the Mantegna\r\nto win our sympathy by the beauty of the human type. This, on the other\r\nhand, is of the essence of Correggio's art. \"The figure of Christ and\r\nthe Angel represent the dignity of perfect humanity; and Correggio\r\nmakes the pathos of the expiatory sacrifice of Calvary turn upon this\r\nconsideration. This is the strictly Renaissance point of view\" (J. E.\r\nHodgson, R.A., in _Magazine of Art_, 1886, p. 215).\r\n\r\nThe original picture has a legend attached to it. \"Correggio,\" says\r\nLomazzo, \"was accustomed always to value his works at a very low price,\r\nand having on one occasion to pay a bill of four or five _scudi_ to an\r\napothecary in his native city, he painted him 'Christ Praying in the\r\nGarden,' which he executed with all possible care.\" The picture was\r\nsold shortly afterwards for 500 _scudi_. It was subsequently in the\r\nroyal collection at Madrid, and after the battle of Vittoria it was\r\nfound in Joseph Bonaparte's carriage by one of Wellington's colonels.\r\nWellington hastened to restore it to Ferdinand VII., who, not to be\r\noutdone in courtesy, presented it to the duke. The picture in our\r\nGallery was part of the Angerstein collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n77. THE STONING OF ST. STEPHEN.\r\n\r\n  _Domenichino_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1581-1641). _See_ 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n78.[90] LANDSCAPE WITH RUINS.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Berchem_ (Dutch: 1620-1683).\r\n\r\n      Nicolas Pietersz, son of Pieter Claesz, a painter, called\r\n      himself Berchem, by which name he is entered in the town\r\n      records of Haarlem, and by which he signed his pictures. He\r\n      married the daughter of his master, Jan Wils (No. 1007). In\r\n      1642 he became a member of the Guild of St. Luke at Haarlem.\r\n      No authentic information exists about his visiting Italy,\r\n      but that he had travelled in that country is clear from the\r\n      views represented in his pictures, and from the character\r\n      of his landscapes generally. His style resembles that of\r\n      another Dutch \"Italianiser,\" Jan Both (No. 71), and there\r\n      seems to have been some rivalry between the two men. It is\r\n      related that a burgomaster of Dordrecht, Van der Hulk by\r\n      name, commissioned a picture from each painter, promising an\r\n      additional premium to the one whose work should be thought\r\n      the better. On the completion Of the pictures, the patron\r\n      declared that the admirable works had deprived him of the\r\n      capability of preference, and that both were entitled to the\r\n      premium. The picture painted on this occasion by Berchem is the\r\n      \"Halt of Huntsmen,\" now in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg.\r\n      Berchem's landscapes are taken, says Dr. Richter, \"from the\r\n      mountainous countries of Italy, and the types and costumes of\r\n      the figures therein represented are also entirely Italian,\r\n      though not copied direct from nature. He probably painted\r\n      most of his Italian landscapes in Holland. What characterises\r\n      him principally is a brilliant and easy touch, with which\r\n      he renders nature with more art than exactitude. He is more\r\n      ingenious in his conceptions than profound or true.\" The\r\n      mannerism and monotony of his works accord with what is told\r\n      of his life. In 1665, when at the height of his reputation, he\r\n      sold his labour to a dealer, from early in the morning to four\r\n      in the afternoon, for ten florins a day. His wife, it appears,\r\n      kept the purse, and is said to have doled out very scanty\r\n      supplies--a precaution which was perhaps necessary, as Berchem\r\n      had a weakness for Italian drawings, his collection of which\r\n      sold at his death for 12,800 florins.\r\n\r\n\r\n81. THE VISION OF ST. AUGUSTINE.\r\n\r\n  _Garofalo_ (Ferrarese: 1481-1559).\r\n\r\n      Benvenuto Tisio, called Garofalo[91] from the village of\r\n      that name on the Po to which his family belonged, was (like\r\n      Sodoma) the son of a shoemaker, and having shown a strong taste\r\n      for art, was apprenticed as a lad to the Ferrarese painter,\r\n      Domenico Panetti. Seven years later he went to Cremona and\r\n      attached himself to Boccaccino (806). He left Cremona suddenly,\r\n      as described in a letter, still extant, from Boccaccino to\r\n      Garofalo's father: \"Had your son,\" he writes, \"learnt good\r\n      manners as thoroughly as he has learnt painting, he would\r\n      scarcely have played me such a shabby trick. He has taken\r\n      himself off, I know not whither, and without a word. But this\r\n      may be a clue to his whereabouts, that he said, if he is to be\r\n      believed, that he would see Rome.\" From Rome he returned to\r\n      Ferrara, where he formed a warm friendship with the brothers\r\n      Dossi. In 1509 he was again in Rome, where he saw and admired\r\n      Michael Angelo's frescoes in the Sixtine Chapel in all the\r\n      splendour of their freshness. He also greatly admired the work\r\n      of Raphael; \"and displayed,\" says Vasari, \"so much diffidence\r\n      as well as courtesy that he became the friend of Raphael, who,\r\n      kind and obliging as he was, assisted and favoured Benvenuto\r\n      much, teaching him many things.\" In 1511 Benvenuto was at\r\n      Mantua, but in the following year he returned to Ferrara,\r\n      which remained his home for the rest of his life. There, says\r\n      Vasari, who was entertained by him, he lived a particularly\r\n      happy and busy life, being \"cheerful of disposition, mild in\r\n      his converse, warmly attached to his friends, beyond measure\r\n      affectionate and devoted, and always supporting the trials of\r\n      his life with patient resignation.\" These trials were very\r\n      heavy, for soon after he was forty he lost the sight of one\r\n      eye; \"nor was he without fear and much danger of losing the\r\n      other. He then recommended himself to God, and made a vow to\r\n      wear grey clothing ever after, as, in fact, he did, when by\r\n      the grace of God the sight of the left eye was preserved to\r\n      him so perfectly that the works executed by Garofalo in his\r\n      sixty-fifth year are so well done, so delicately finished,\r\n      and evince so much care, that they are truly wonderful.\" For\r\n      the last nine years of his life he was totally blind, in\r\n      which affliction he solaced himself by cultivating music.\r\n      Garofalo's works are very numerous; many of them are in France\r\n      and in Rome, and in our own Gallery he is well represented.\r\n      \"He was conscientious and truthful within his scope, and the\r\n      ease and delicacy with which he carried out his smaller works\r\n      could hardly be exceeded.\" He was an eclectic rather than an\r\n      original painter, though he remained Ferrarese throughout in\r\n      his system of colouring. \"His fellow-countrymen have called\r\n      him the 'Ferrarese Raphael,' in the same way that the Milanese\r\n      have called Luini the 'Lombard Raphael,' and, if properly\r\n      understood, both appellations have their meaning; for these\r\n      painters occupy much the same position in their respective\r\n      schools as did Raphael in the Umbrian, Andrea del Sarto in the\r\n      Florentine, etc., though the individual gifts of each were of\r\n      course very different.\" (Morelli's _Borghese and Doria-Pamfili\r\n      Galleries_, pp. 200-214, contains a detailed account of\r\n      Garofalo. His theory that the works attributed to Ortolano\r\n      are in reality early works of Garofalo is very doubtful. See\r\n      on this point under 699, and _cf._ Venturi's criticism in the\r\n      Catalogue of the Ferrarese Exhibition at the Burlington Fine\r\n      Arts Club).\r\n\r\nA well-known incident in the life of St. Augustine, Bishop of Hippo in\r\nAfrica (A.D. 354-430), one of the \"doctors\" of the Christian Church\r\nwhose writings have had a greater effect than those probably of any\r\none man on the beliefs and lives of succeeding Christian ages. Whilst\r\nbusied, he tells us, in writing his discourse on the Trinity, he one\r\nday beheld a child, who, having dug a hole in the sand, was bringing\r\nwater, as children at the seaside do, to empty the sea into his hole.\r\nAugustine told him it was impossible. \"Not more impossible,\" replied\r\nthe child, \"than for thee, O Augustine! to explain the mystery on\r\nwhich thou art now meditating\" (\"Canst thou by searching find out God?\r\ncanst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? It is as high as\r\nheaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know? The\r\nmeasure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea,\"\r\nJob xi. 7-9). The painter shows the visionary nature of the scene by\r\nplacing beside St Augustine the figure of St. Catherine, the patron\r\nsaint of theologians and scholars, and in the background, on a little\r\njutting cape, St. Stephen, whose life and actions are set forth in St.\r\nAugustine's writings. The saint himself receives the child's lesson\r\nwith the contemptuous impatience of a scholar's ambition; but all the\r\ntime the heavens whose mysteries he would fain explore are open behind\r\nhim, and the angel choirs are singing that he who would enter in must\r\nfirst become as a little child, \"for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n82. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Mazzolino_ (Ferrarese: 1480-1528). _See_ 169.\r\n\r\nFor better examples of this painter, _see_ Nos. 169 and 641.\r\n\r\n\r\n84. MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Salvator Rosa_ (Neapolitan: 1615-1673).\r\n\r\n      \"What is most to be admired in the works of Salvator Rosa,\"\r\n      says Sir Joshua Reynolds, \"is the perfect correspondence\r\n      which he observed between the subjects which he chose and his\r\n      manner of treating them. Everything is of a piece: his rocks,\r\n      trees, sky, even to his handling, have the same wild and rude\r\n      character which animates his figures.\" There is perhaps no\r\n      painter whose life is more accurately reflected in his work\r\n      than Salvator. Conspicuous in this picture are a withered tree\r\n      on the right and a withered tree on the left: they are typical\r\n      of the painter's blasted life, and \"indignant, desolate,\r\n      and degraded art.\" He was born near Naples, the son of an\r\n      architect and land-surveyor. In early youth he forsook his\r\n      father's business and began secretly to learn painting. At\r\n      seventeen his father died, and Salvator, being one of a large\r\n      and poor family, was thrown on his own resources. He \"cast\r\n      himself carelessly on the current of life. No rectitude of\r\n      ledger-lines stood in his way; no tender precision of household\r\n      customs; no calm successions of rural labour. But past his\r\n      half-starved lips rolled profusion of pitiless wealth; before\r\n      him glared and swept the troops of shameless pleasure. Above\r\n      him muttered Vesuvius; beneath his feet shook the Solfatara. In\r\n      heart disdainful, in temper adventurous; conscious of power,\r\n      impatient of labour, and yet more of the pride of the patrons\r\n      of his youth, he fled to the Calabrian hills, seeking, not\r\n      knowledge, but freedom. If he was to be surrounded by cruelty\r\n      and deceit, let them at least be those of brave men or savage\r\n      beasts, not of the timorous and the contemptible. Better the\r\n      wrath of the robber than enmity of the priest; and the cunning\r\n      of the wolf than of the hypocrite.\" It was in this frame of\r\n      mind that he sought the solitudes of the hills: \"How I hate\r\n      the sight of every spot that is inhabited,\" he says in one of\r\n      his letters. It was thus that he formed the taste for the wild\r\n      nature which distinguishes his landscapes. It is said indeed\r\n      that he once herded for a time with a band of brigands in the\r\n      Abruzzi. \"Yet even among such scenes as these Salvator might\r\n      have been calmed and exalted had he been, indeed, capable of\r\n      exaltation. But he was not of high temper enough to perceive\r\n      beauty. He had not the sacred sense--the sense of colour; all\r\n      the loveliest hues of the Calabrian air were invisible to him;\r\n      the sorrowful desolation of the Calabrian villages unfelt. He\r\n      saw only what was gross and terrible,--the jagged peak, the\r\n      splintered tree, the flowerless bank of grass, and wandering\r\n      weed, prickly and pale. His temper confirmed itself in evil,\r\n      and became more and more fierce and morose; though not, I\r\n      believe, cruel, ungenerous, or lascivious. I should not suspect\r\n      Salvator of wantonly inflicting pain. His constantly painting\r\n      it does not prove he delighted in it; he felt the horror of it,\r\n      and in that horror, fascination. Also, he desired fame, and saw\r\n      that here was an untried field rich enough in morbid excitement\r\n      to catch the humour of his indolent patrons. But the gloom\r\n      gained upon him, and grasped him. He could jest, indeed, as men\r\n      jest in prison-yards (he became afterwards a renowned mimic in\r\n      Florence); his satires are full of good mocking, but his own\r\n      doom to sadness is never repealed.\" It is characteristic of\r\n      the man that the picture on the reputation of which he went\r\n      up from Naples to Rome was \"Tityus torn by the Vulture.\" At\r\n      Rome, besides his fame as a painter, he made his mark as a\r\n      musician, poet, and improvisatore. He cut a brave figure in\r\n      the Carnival, and his satires were bold and biting. Partly on\r\n      this account he afterwards found it well to leave Rome for\r\n      Florence, where he formed one of the company of \"I Percossi\"\r\n      (the stricken)--of jovial wits and artists--who enjoyed the\r\n      hospitalities of Cardinal Carlo Giovanni de' Medici. But in\r\n      spite of his merry-making he knew (as he says in a cantata)\r\n      \"no truce from care, no pause from woe.\" He ultimately died\r\n      of the dropsy, having shortly before his death married the\r\n      Florentine Lucrezia, who had borne him two sons. \"Of all men\r\n      whose work I have ever studied,\" says Mr. Ruskin, in summing\r\n      up his career as typical of the lives which cannot conquer\r\n      evil but remain at war with, or in captivity to it, \"he gives\r\n      me most distinctly the idea of a lost spirit. Michelet calls\r\n      him, 'Ce damné Salvator,' perhaps in a sense merely harsh and\r\n      violent; the epithet to me seems true in a more literal, more\r\n      merciful sense,--'That condemned Salvator.' I see in him,\r\n      notwithstanding all his baseness, the last traces of spiritual\r\n      life in the art of Europe.... All succeeding men ... were men\r\n      of the world; they are never in earnest and they are never\r\n      appalled. But Salvator was capable of pensiveness, of faith,\r\n      and of fear. The misery of the earth is a marvel to him; he\r\n      cannot leave off gazing at it. The religion of the earth is a\r\n      horror to him. He gnashes his teeth at it, rages at it, mocks\r\n      and gibes at it. He would have acknowledged religion had he\r\n      seen any that was true.... Helpless Salvator! A little early\r\n      sympathy, a word of true guidance, perhaps, had saved him.\r\n      What says he of himself? 'Despiser of wealth and of death.'\r\n      Two grand scorns: but, oh, condemned Salvator! the question\r\n      is not for man what he can scorn, but what he can love.\" At\r\n      the \"opposite poles of art are Fra Angelico and Salvator Rosa;\r\n      of whom the one was a man who smiled seldom, wept often,\r\n      prayed constantly, and never harboured an impure thought. His\r\n      pictures are simply so many pieces of jewellery, the colour of\r\n      the draperies being perfectly pure, as various as those of a\r\n      painted window, chastened only by paleness, and relieved upon\r\n      a gold ground. Salvator was a dissipated jester and satirist,\r\n      a man who spent his life in masquing and revelry. But his\r\n      pictures are full of horror, and their colour is for the most\r\n      part gloomy grey. Truly it would seem as if art had so much\r\n      eternity in it that it must take its dye from the close rather\r\n      than the course of life; 'in such laughter the heart of man is\r\n      sorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heaviness'\" (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. iv. See also vol. i. pt. i. sec.\r\n      ii. ch. ii. § 9; vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. xviii. § 21; vol. v. pt.\r\n      ix. ch. viii. § 14. _Stones of Venice_, vol. ii. ch. v. § 31.\r\n      For a full record of fact and romance about this painter, see\r\n      Lady Morgan's interesting _Life and Times of Salvator Rosa_;\r\n      London, 1855).\r\n\r\nAn illustration of Æsop's fable of the dishonest woodman who, hearing\r\nof the reward which an honest fellow-labourer had obtained from Mercury\r\nfor not claiming either the gold or silver axe which the god first\r\noffered, threw his axe also into the water, hoping for like good\r\nfortune. Mercury--here seen standing in the stream--showed him a golden\r\naxe. He claimed it, and the god having rebuked him for his impudence,\r\nleft him to lose his axe and repent of his folly. The painting of the\r\npicture is conspicuous for that want of sense for colour, noted above\r\nas fatally characteristic of Salvator:--\r\n\r\n      There is on the left-hand side something without doubt intended\r\n      for a rocky mountain, in the middle distance, near enough\r\n      for all its fissures and crags to be distinctly visible, or,\r\n      rather, for a great many awkward scratches of the brush over it\r\n      to be visible, which, though not particularly representative\r\n      either of one thing or another, are without doubt intended to\r\n      be symbolical of rocks. Now no mountain in full light, and near\r\n      enough for its details of crags to be seen, is without great\r\n      variety of delicate colour. Salvator has painted it throughout\r\n      without one instant of variation; but this, I suppose, is\r\n      simplicity and generalisation;--let it pass: but what is the\r\n      colour? _Pure sky blue_, without one grain of grey, or any\r\n      modifying hue whatsoever; the same brush which had just given\r\n      the bluest parts of the sky has been more loaded at the same\r\n      part of the pallet, and the whole mountain thrown in with\r\n      unmitigated ultramarine. Now, mountains can only become pure\r\n      blue when there is so much air between them that they become\r\n      mere flat dark shades, every detail being totally lost:\r\n      they become blue when they become air, and not till then.\r\n      Consequently this part of Salvator's painting, being of hills\r\n      perfectly clear and near, with all their details visible, is,\r\n      as far as colour is concerned, broad, bold falsehood, the\r\n      direct assertion of direct impossibility.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Salvator's want of sense for colour one should\r\ntake his insensitiveness to other beauty. For instance, his choice\r\nof withered trees, which are here on both sides of us, \"is precisely\r\nthe sign of his preferring ugliness to beauty, decrepitude and\r\ndisorganisation to life and youth\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii.\r\nsec. ii. ch. ii. § 4; vol. v. pt. vi. ch. viii. § 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n85.

Erminia from the beleaguered city of Jerusalem had beheld\r\nthe Christian knight, Tancred, whom she loved, wounded in conflict.\r\nDisguised in the armour of her friend Clorinda, wearing a dark blue\r\ncuirass with a white mantle over it, she stole forth at night to tend\r\nhim. The sentinels espy her and give her chase. But she outstrips them\r\nall, and after a three days' flight finds herself amongst a shepherd\r\nfamily, who entertain her kindly. The old shepherd is busily making\r\ncard-baskets, and listening to the music of his children. Their fear\r\ngives place to delight as the strange warrior, having dismounted from\r\nher horse and thrown off her helmet and shield, unbinds her tresses and\r\ndiscloses herself a woman--\r\n\r\n              An old man, on a rising ground,\r\n        In the fresh shade, his white flocks feeding near,\r\n        Twig baskets wove; and listen'd to the sound\r\n    Trill'd by three blooming boys, who sat disporting round.\r\n              These, at the shining of her silver arms,\r\n        Were seized at once with wonder and despair;\r\n        But sweet Erminia sooth'd their vain alarms,\r\n        Discovering her dove's eyes and golden hair.\r\n        \"Follow,\" she said, \"dear innocents, the care\r\n        Of heaven, your fanciful employ;\r\n        For the so formidable arms I bear,\r\n        No cruel warfare bring, nor harsh annoy\r\n    To your engaging tasks, to your sweet songs of joy.\"\r\n\r\n  From Landseer's _Catalogue_, p. 214.\r\n\r\nThis picture has sometimes been ascribed to Domenichino; as the latter\r\nwas occasionally employed by Annibale to execute his designs, both\r\nmasters may have had a share in the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n91.

The old preceptor is leering and\r\npampered, yet with something of a schoolmaster's gravity, \"half\r\ninclining to the brute, half conscious of the god.\" The young\r\npupil--like the shepherd boy in Sidney's _Arcadia_, \"piping as though\r\nhe should never be old\"--is \"full of simple careless grace, laughing in\r\nyouth and beauty; he holds the Pan's pipe in both hands, and looks up\r\nwith timid wonder, with an expression of mingled delight and surprise\r\nat the sounds he produces\" (Hazlitt: _Criticisms upon Art_, p. 6).\r\n\r\nThese two pictures--together with the \"Lot\" and \"Susannah\" of Guido\r\n(193 and 196)--used to hang in the Lancellotti Palace in Rome. Lanzi\r\ndescribes our picture, No. 94, as one of the principal treasures of\r\nthat collection. It is exquisitely finished, he says; the figures are\r\n\"at once designed, coloured, and disposed with the hand of a great\r\nmaster\" (Bohn's translation, iii. 79).\r\n\r\n\r\n95. DIDO AND ÆNEAS.\r\n\r\n  _Gaspard Poussin_ (French: 1613-1675). _See_ 31.\r\n\r\nDido, Queen of Carthage, enamoured of the Trojan Æneas, the destined\r\nfounder of Rome, sought to detain him by strategy within her dominions.\r\nThe goddess Juno, who had espoused Dido's cause, contrived that a storm\r\nshould befall when the Queen and her guests were on a hunting party\r\n(_Æneid_, iv. 119). In front of the cave a Cupid holds the horse of\r\nÆneas, and two others are fluttering above. High in the clouds is Juno,\r\naccompanied by Venus, who had contrived all this for Dido's undoing.\r\n\r\nAs for the execution of the picture, \"the stormy wind blows loudly\r\nthrough its leaves, but the total want of invention in the cloud-forms\r\nbears it down beyond redemption. Look at the wreaths of _cloud_ (?),\r\nwith their unpleasant edges cut as hard and solid and opaque and smooth\r\nas thick black paint can make them, rolled up over one another like a\r\ndirty sail badly reefed\"[93] (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec.\r\niii. ch. iv. § 23; vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. ii. § 18).\r\n\r\n\r\n97. THE RAPE OF EUROPA.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Veronese_ (Veronese: 1528-1588). _See_ 26 & p. xix.\r\n\r\n(A study for a larger picture now at Vienna.) Jupiter, enamoured of\r\nEuropa, a Phoenician princess, transformed himself into a white bull,\r\nand mingled with her father's herds whilst she was gathering flowers\r\nwith her attendants. Europa, struck by the beauty and gentle nature\r\nof the beast, caressed him, and even mounted on his back. Two of her\r\nattendants are here assisting her, while a third remonstrates with her\r\non her foolhardiness. Europa is replying that she has no fears. The\r\namorous bull meanwhile is licking her foot. He is garlanded with a\r\nwreath of flowers, which is held by his master Cupid, forming thus the\r\nleading-string of Love. With the other hand Cupid has \"taken the bull\r\nby the horn\"; whilst above, two little winged loves are gathering fruit\r\nand scattering roses. In the middle distance Europa and the bull appear\r\nagain, about to enter the sea; whilst farther on, the bull is swimming\r\nwith her toward the land. For the story goes that as soon as Europa\r\nhad seated herself on his back Jupiter crossed the sea and carried her\r\nsafely to the island of Crete, and from this rape of Europa comes the\r\nname of the continent to which she was carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n98. VIEW OF LA RICCIA.\r\n\r\n  _Gaspard Poussin_ (French: 1613-1675). _See_ 31.\r\n\r\nThis picture and the scene of it--the ancient town of Aricia, about\r\nfifteen miles from Rome, famous in Roman legend, and Horace's first\r\nstopping-place on his journey to Brindisi--are described by Ruskin in\r\na celebrated passage of _Modern Painters_:--\r\n\r\n      \"Whether it can be supposed to resemble the ancient Aricia,\r\n      now La Riccia, close to Albano, I will not take upon me to\r\n      determine, seeing that most of the towns of those old masters\r\n      are quite as much like one place as another; but, at any rate,\r\n      it is a town on a hill, wooded with two-and-thirty bushes,\r\n      of very uniform size, and possessing about the same number\r\n      of leaves each. These bushes are all painted in with one\r\n      dull opaque brown, becoming very slightly greenish towards\r\n      the lights, and discover in one place a bit of rock, which\r\n      of course would in nature have been cool and grey beside the\r\n      lustrous hues of foliage, and which, therefore, being moreover\r\n      completely in shade, is consistently and scientifically painted\r\n      of a very clear, pretty, and positive brick red, the only thing\r\n      like colour in the picture. The foreground is a piece of road\r\n      which, in order to make allowance for its greater nearness, for\r\n      its being completely in light, and, it may be presumed, for the\r\n      quantity of vegetation usually present on carriage-roads, is\r\n      given in a very cool green grey; and the truth of the picture\r\n      is completed by a number of dots in the sky on the right, with\r\n      a stalk to them, of a sober and similar brown.[94]\r\n\r\n      \"Not long ago, I was slowly descending this very bit of\r\n      carriage road.... The noonday sun came slanting down the rocky\r\n      slopes of La Riccia, and their masses of entangled and tall\r\n      foliage, whose autumnal tints were mixed with the wet verdure\r\n      of a thousand evergreens, were penetrated with it as with rain.\r\n      I cannot call it colour: it was conflagration. Purple and\r\n      crimson and scarlet, like the curtains of God's tabernacle,\r\n      the rejoicing trees sank into the valley in showers of light,\r\n      every separate leaf quivering with buoyant and burning life;\r\n      each, as it turned to reflect or to transmit the sunbeam, first\r\n      a torch and then an emerald. Far up into the recesses of the\r\n      valley, the green vistas arched like the hollows of mighty\r\n      waves of some crystalline sea, with the arbutus flowers dashed\r\n      along their flanks for foam, and silver flakes of orange spray\r\n      tossed into the air around them, breaking over the grey walls\r\n      of rock into a thousand separate stars, fading and kindling\r\n      alternately as the weak wind lifted and let them fall. Every\r\n      glade of grass burned like the golden floor of heaven, opening\r\n      in sudden gleams as the foliage broke and closed above it, as\r\n      sheet-lightning opens in a cloud at sunset; the motionless\r\n      masses of dark rock--dark though flushed with scarlet lichen,\r\n      casting their quiet shadows across its restless radiance, the\r\n      fountain underneath them filling its marble hollow with blue\r\n      mist and fitful sound; and over all, the multitudinous bars\r\n      of amber and rose, the sacred clouds that have no darkness,\r\n      and only exist to illumine, were seen in fathomless intervals\r\n      between the solemn and orbed repose of the stone pines, passing\r\n      to lose themselves in the last, white, blinding lustre of the\r\n      measureless line where the Campagna melted into the sea. Tell\r\n      me who is likest this, Poussin or Turner?\" (vol. i. pt. ii.\r\n      sec. ii. ch. ii. §§ 1-3).\r\n\r\nRuskin further instances the picture as an example of \"untruth of\r\ntrees.\" It is an elementary law of tree structure that stems only taper\r\nwhen sending off foliage and sprays:--\r\n\r\n      \"Therefore we see at once that the stem of Gaspard Poussin's\r\n      tall tree, on the right of the 'La Riccia,' is the painting\r\n      of a carrot or a parsnip, not of the trunk of a tree\" (see\r\n      further, _ibid._, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. vi. ch. i. § 6; and\r\n      _cf._ vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. ii. § 18).\r\n\r\n\r\n101, 102, 103, 104. THE FOUR AGES OF MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Lancret_ (French: 1690-1743).\r\n\r\n      Lancret, a painter of the \"fêtes galantes\" school, was an\r\n      imitator of Watteau, but his productions lack the airy grace\r\n      and touch of poetry which elevate even the most frivolous\r\n      pictures of that \"prince of court painters\" into works of\r\n      fine art. Examples of Watteau are now included among the\r\n      National treasures in the Wallace collection at Hertford House.\r\n      Lancret was the son of humble parents, and received his early\r\n      training as an engraver. Entering subsequently the studio of\r\n      Claude Gillot he came under the influence of Watteau, but his\r\n      friendship with that painter was short-lived. A rivalry appears\r\n      to have sprung up between them, and they remained estranged\r\n      until the closing year of Watteau's life. \"Lancret was a\r\n      thorough _bourgeois_, and passed his time chiefly in Paris.\r\n      He was a regular frequenter of the opera and the 'Comique,'\r\n      and was a friend of the dancers La Camargo and La Sallé, whom\r\n      he frequently represented in his works\" (Bryan's _Dictionary\r\n      of Painters_). In 1719 he was admitted into the Academy,\r\n      and in 1735 was elected Councillor. In 1840 he married a\r\n      grand-daughter of the comic poet Boursault.\r\n\r\nThese pictures, which are among the principal works of Lancret, are\r\ninteresting historical records as showing the ideal of life at the\r\nFrench Court in the time of the regent Orleans and Louis XV. In\r\n\"Infancy\" (101) children, in the gayest clothes and garlanded with\r\nflowers, are at play under a stately portico--life being not so much\r\na stage as a game, and all the men and women (in that sense) \"merely\r\nplayers.\" To what should children, thus educated, grow up but to the\r\npomps and vanity of life, as shown in \"Youth\" (102)? The adornment of\r\nthe person is the chief occupation, it would seem, of the dwellers in\r\n\"the Armida Palace, where the inmates live enchanted lives, lapped in\r\nsoft music of adulation, waited on by the splendours of the world.\"\r\nAnd \"Manhood\" (103) is like unto youth. The business of life is\r\npleasure on the greensward, with shooting at the popinjay! \"Old Age\"\r\n(104) has no place in such a philosophy of life. One old man is indeed\r\nattempting a last amour. The other caresses a dog, while the old women\r\nsleep or spin. But in \"Old Age\" the painter changes his scene from the\r\ncourt to common life; the thought of old age is banished, it seems,\r\nfrom the high life of princes. \"In short,\" wrote an English observer at\r\nthe time when this picture was painted, \"all the symptoms which I have\r\never met with in History, previous to all Changes and Revolutions in\r\ngovernment, now exist and daily increase in France\" (Lord Chesterfield:\r\nsee Carlyle's _French Revolution_, bk. i. ch. ii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n125. IZAAK WALTON (1593-1683).\r\n\r\n  _Jacob Huysman_ (Dutch: 1656-1696).\r\n\r\n      Huysman was one of the many foreign artists who settled in\r\n      England under the Stuarts. He obtained considerable employment\r\n      as a portrait painter, in spite of Sir Peter Lely's rivalry;\r\n      one of the portraits among the \"Windsor Beauties,\" now at\r\n      Hampton Court, was painted by him.\r\n\r\nA portrait of the retired city hosier who became famous as the author\r\nof the _Complete Angler_. It was painted for his family (with whom\r\nit remained till it was presented to the National Gallery in 1838),\r\nand was engraved in one of the later editions of the book (1836).\r\nIzaak Walton--\"that quaint, old, cruel coxcomb\" (as Byron, who was no\r\nfisherman, called him)--lived to be ninety: his fishing did something,\r\none may expect, to keep him in the vigorous health which is here\r\nstamped on his face. \"The features of the countenance often enable us,\"\r\nsays Zouch in the _Memoirs of Izaak Walton_ (cited in M. E. Wotton's\r\n_Word Portraits of Famous Writers_, p. 323), \"to form a judgment, not\r\nvery fallible, of the disposition of the mind. In few portraits can\r\nthis discovery be more successfully pursued than in that of Izaak\r\nWalton. Lavater, the acute master of physiognomy, would, I think,\r\ninstantly acknowledge in it the decisive traits of the original,--mild\r\ncomplacency, forbearance, mature consideration, calm activity, peace,\r\nsound understanding, power of thought, discerning attention, and\r\nsecretly active friendship. Happy in his unblemished integrity, happy\r\nin the approbation and esteem of others, he enwraps himself in his own\r\nvirtue. The exaltation of a good conscience eminently shines forth in\r\nthis venerable person.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n127. VENICE: THE SCUOLA DELLA CARITÀ.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768).\r\n\r\n      Antonio Canale, commonly called Canaletto,[95] was born in\r\n      Venice, lived in Venice, and painted Venice. His pictures (of\r\n      which the one before us is among the best) are in some respects\r\n      very like the place, but most of those who love it best soon\r\n      find much that is wanting in Canaletto's representations. \"The\r\n      effect of a fine Canaletto,\" says Ruskin, \"is, in its first\r\n      impression, dioramic. We fancy we are in our beloved Venice\r\n      again, with one foot, by mistake, in the clear, invisible film\r\n      of water lapping over the marble steps of the foreground. Every\r\n      house has its proper relief against the sky; every brick and\r\n      stone its proper hue of sunlight and shade; and every degree\r\n      of distance its proper tone of relieving air. Presently,\r\n      however, we begin to feel that it is hard and gloomy, and that\r\n      the painter, compelled by the lowness of the utmost light at\r\n      his disposal to deepen the shadows, in order to get the right\r\n      relation, has lost the flashing, dazzling, exulting light\r\n      which was one of our chief sources of Venetian happiness.\r\n      But we pardon this, knowing it to be unavoidable, and begin\r\n      to look for something of that in which Venice differs from\r\n      Rotterdam, or any other city built beside canals. We know that\r\n      house, certainly; we never passed it without stopping our\r\n      gondola, for its arabesques were as rich as a bank of flowers\r\n      in spring, and as beautiful as a dream. What has Canaletto\r\n      given us for them? Four black dots. Well; take the next house.\r\n      We remember that too; it was mouldering inch by inch into\r\n      the canal, and the bricks had fallen away from its shattered\r\n      marble shafts, and left them white, skeleton-like; yet, with\r\n      their fretwork of cold flowers wreathed about them still,\r\n      untouched by time, and through the rents of the wall behind\r\n      them there used to come long sunbeams, greened by the weeds\r\n      through which they pierced, which flitted and fell, one by\r\n      one, round those grey and quiet shafts, catching here a leaf\r\n      and there a leaf, and gliding over the illumined edges and\r\n      delicate fissures, until they sank into the deep dark hollow\r\n      between the marble blocks of the sunk foundation, lighting\r\n      every other moment one isolated emerald lamp on the crest of\r\n      the intermittent waves, when the wild sea-weeds and crimson\r\n      lichens drifted and crawled with their thousand colours\r\n      and free branches over its decay, and the black, clogging,\r\n      accumulated limpets hung in ropy clusters from the dripping\r\n      and tinkling stone. What has Canaletto given us for this? One\r\n      square red mass, composed of--let me count--five-and-fifty,\r\n      no; six-and-fifty, no; I was right at first, five-and-fifty\r\n      bricks, of precisely the same size, shape, and colour, one\r\n      great black line for the shadow of the roof at the top, and\r\n      six similar ripples in a row at the bottom! And this is\r\n      what people call 'painting nature'! It is, indeed, painting\r\n      nature, as she appears to the most unfeeling and untaught of\r\n      mankind. The bargeman and the bricklayer probably see no more\r\n      in Venice than Canaletto gives--heaps of earth and mortar,\r\n      with water between--and are just as capable of appreciating\r\n      the facts of sunlight and shadow, by which he deceives us,\r\n      as the most educated of us all. But what more there is in\r\n      Venice than brick and stone--what there is of mystery and\r\n      death, and memory and beauty--what there is to be learned or\r\n      lamented, to be loved or wept--we look for to Canaletto in\r\n      vain\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. sec. ii. pt. i. ch. vii. §\r\n      7, first edition). Canaletto's pictures of Venice in this room\r\n      should be compared with Turner's. It is impossible to get a\r\n      more instructive instance of the different impression made on\r\n      different minds by the same scenes. Canaletto drew, says one\r\n      of his admirers (_Lanzi_, ii. 317), exactly as he saw. Well,\r\n      what he did see we have shown us here. What others have seen,\r\n      those who have not been to Venice can discover from Turner's\r\n      pictures, from Shelley's and Byron's verse, or Ruskin's prose.\r\n      \"Let the reader restore Venice in his imagination to some\r\n      resemblance of what she must have been before her fall. Let\r\n      him, looking from Lido or Fusina, replace, in the forest of\r\n      towers, those of the hundred and sixty-six churches which the\r\n      French threw down; let him sheet her walls with purple and\r\n      scarlet, overlay her minarets with gold, ... and fill her\r\n      canals with gilded barges and bannered ships; finally, let him\r\n      withdraw from this scene, already so brilliant, such sadness\r\n      and stain as had been set upon it by the declining energies of\r\n      more than half a century, and he will see Venice as it was seen\r\n      by Canaletto (as it might have been seen by him, Ruskin means);\r\n      whose miserable, virtueless, heartless mechanism, accepted\r\n      as the representation of such various glory, is, both in its\r\n      existence and acceptance, among the most striking signs of the\r\n      lost sensation and deadened intellect of the nation at that\r\n      time.... The mannerism of Canaletto is the most degraded that\r\n      I know in the whole range of art. Professing the most servile\r\n      and mindless imitation, it imitates nothing but the blackness\r\n      of the shadows; it gives no single architectural ornament,\r\n      however near, so much form, as might enable us even to guess\r\n      at its actual one; ... it gives the buildings neither their\r\n      architectural beauty nor their ancestral dignity, for there is\r\n      no texture of stone nor character of age in Canaletto's touch;\r\n      which is invariably a violent, black, sharp, ruled penmanlike\r\n      line, as far removed from the grace of nature as from her\r\n      faintness and transparency: and for his truth of colour let\r\n      the single fact of his having omitted all record whatsoever\r\n      of the frescoes, whose wrecks are still to be found at least\r\n      on one half of the unrestored palaces, and, with still less\r\n      excusableness, all record of the magnificent coloured marbles\"\r\n      (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt ii. sec. i. ch. vii. § 30).\r\n      Stated in the fewest words, the difference between Canaletto\r\n      and the others is this: To Canaletto Venice was a city of murky\r\n      shadows, to them it is a city of enchanted colour. But his\r\n      pictures satisfied the taste of his time, as the great number\r\n      of them still extant testifies. Moreover his fame extended\r\n      beyond his own country. There was an English resident at Venice\r\n      who engaged Canaletto (who started in life at his father's\r\n      profession, that of scene painter) to work for him at low\r\n      prices, and then used to retail the pictures at an enormous\r\n      profit to English travellers. At last Canaletto came to England\r\n      himself, and was given many commissions; but after two years he\r\n      returned to Venice, as it was still Venetian pictures that his\r\n      patrons wanted. How completely the public taste has now changed\r\n      is shown by the fact that the Venice of all the most popular\r\n      painters to-day, of whatever nation, is the Venice of Ruskin\r\n      and Turner. Canaletto's pictures, however, will always possess\r\n      one element of interest, apart from any fluctuations in taste.\r\n      Within his limits they are historical records of the appearance\r\n      of Venice in his time; and as more and more of the old Venice\r\n      is destroyed, Canaletto's pictures will increase in interest.\r\n      For though he is mechanical, yet his mechanism is very good.\r\n      He was, by the way, the first to apply the camera obscura to\r\n      linear perspective, and he painted in a workmanlike manner, so\r\n      that his pictures endure.[96]\r\n\r\nAn interesting piece of \"old Venice.\" Beyond the canal is what is\r\nnow the National Gallery of Venice--the Academy of Arts--but was\r\nin Canaletto's time still the Scuola della Carità, the conventual\r\nbuildings of the Brotherhood of our Lady of Charity. Notice the green\r\ngrass in the little square: the Campo, as it is called (the field), is\r\nnow covered with flagstones (there is a sketch of this spot among the\r\nTurner drawings given by Ruskin to the University Galleries at Oxford:\r\nsee _Guide to the Venetian Academy_, p. 34).\r\n\r\n\r\n134. A LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelius Gerritz Decker_ (Dutch: died 1678).\r\n\r\n      \"Amongst the artists who followed the footsteps of Ruysdael and\r\n      Hobbema, the one who most nearly resembled these masters was\r\n      Cornelius Decker, whose works may be classed among the best\r\n      Dutch landscapes\" (Havard's _Dutch School_, p. 209). He painted\r\n      at Haarlem, and studied under Salomon Ruysdael (see 1344).\r\n\r\n\r\n135. LANDSCAPE WITH RUINS.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See_ 127.\r\n\r\nThe artist, \"disgusted with his first profession (of scene painter),\r\nremoved,\" we are told, \"while still young to Rome, where he wholly\r\ndevoted himself to drawing views from nature, and in particular from\r\nancient ruins\" (_Lanzi_, ii. 317).\r\n\r\n\r\n137. LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Goyen_ (Dutch: 1596-1656).\r\n\r\n      Jan van Goyen, one of the first masters in the native Dutch\r\n      art of landscape as opposed to the exotic work of the\r\n      Italianisers, was born at Leyden in 1596. He studied with the\r\n      elder Swanenburch, the father of Rembrandt's first master,\r\n      and subsequently went to Haarlem to work under Esaias van de\r\n      Velde. His position in the world of art was considerable. In\r\n      1640 he was President of the Guild of St. Luke at the Hague;\r\n      his portrait was painted by Vandyck and Frans Hals; and Jan\r\n      Steen was his son-in-law. His earlier extant pictures date\r\n      from 1621, his latest go down to the year of his death. His\r\n      production during this period of thirty-five years was immense;\r\n      \"a single London expert claims to have had at least three or\r\n      four hundred genuine pictures by the master passing through\r\n      his hands during the last thirty years.\" Like so many of the\r\n      Dutch masters whose works are now prized, he received in his\r\n      lifetime very small sums for his pictures--often not more than\r\n      fifteen or twenty florins apiece. He tried to help his income\r\n      by speculating in houses, and even, after the fashion of the\r\n      time, in tulips. But he died insolvent. His work, however, and\r\n      influence remained. His extant pictures are very numerous; and\r\n      among the successors whose skill was largely formed by him are\r\n      Cuyp, Jan van de Cappelle, and Salomon Ruysdael. \"The subjects\r\n      which he preferred were of two kinds: flat landscapes with a\r\n      little broken ground in the front, a cottage, the figures of a\r\n      few peasants, and a clump of trees; or, on the other hand,--and\r\n      these are his best and most characteristic productions--broad\r\n      views of the river scenery of Holland, a wide expanse of water\r\n      under a wide sky.\" He was one of the first to discover a poetry\r\n      in the unbroken horizons of his native land. \"Where he is at\r\n      his best is in the painting of the infinitely varied sky that\r\n      overhangs a great Dutch river or estuary, the clouds taking at\r\n      every movement new shapes or new effects of light and shade,\r\n      and the water below reflecting them\" (see an article on \"The\r\n      Landscape Painters of Holland\" in _The Quarterly Review_,\r\n      October 1891). In order to give his favourite effects, he\r\n      generally placed the skyline very low in the picture, sometimes\r\n      not more than a quarter of the canvas being given to the\r\n      landscape. Van Goyen aimed rather at tone than at colour.\r\n      \"His silvery river-views, with all their delicate shades of\r\n      grey, are almost studies in monochrome.\" In his landscapes\r\n      the foliage and the herbage partake more or less of brown or\r\n      gray. \"No heavy, dark, no bright colour disturbs,\" says Sir F.\r\n      Burton, \"the dreamy monotone.\"\r\n\r\nThis work was formerly ascribed to J. Ruysdael.\r\n\r\n\r\n138. A VIEW IN ROME.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Antonio Panini_ (Roman: 1695-1768).\r\n\r\n      Panini, who obtained celebrity as a painter of architectural\r\n      subjects, was born at Piacenza, and studied in Rome. His\r\n      settled place of abode was that city, but for some time he\r\n      lived in Paris, and in 1732 he was elected a member of the\r\n      French Academy.\r\n\r\nRoman ruins with the pyramid of Caius Cestius.\r\n\r\n\r\n140. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Bartholomeus van der Helst_ (Dutch: 1611-1670).\r\n\r\n      Of the life of Van der Helst, one of the most distinguished\r\n      of the Dutch portrait painters, little is known, except that\r\n      he resided constantly at Amsterdam, and was in good practice\r\n      there as a portrait painter. He had a part in founding the\r\n      Painters' Guild there, whilst his likeness of Paul Potter at\r\n      the Hague (1654), and his partnership with Bakhuizen, who\r\n      laid in the backgrounds of some of his pictures in 1668,\r\n      indicate a constant companionship with the best artists of\r\n      the time. His masterpiece is in the Museum at Amsterdam. It\r\n      contains thirty-five portraits, whole length, and represents\r\n      a banquet given by a company of the civil-guard of Amsterdam,\r\n      in commemoration of the Peace of Münster, in 1648. Sir Joshua\r\n      Reynolds, in his _Journey to Flanders and Holland_, says of\r\n      that work that it \"is, perhaps, the first picture of portraits\r\n      in the world, comprehending more of those qualities which make\r\n      a perfect portrait than any other I have ever seen.\" Whilst\r\n      delighted with Van der Helst, Sir Joshua was disappointed by\r\n      Rembrandt; and certainly \"Van der Helst attracts by qualities\r\n      entirely differing from those of Rembrandt and Frans Hals:\r\n      nothing can be more striking than the contrast between the\r\n      strong concentrated light and the deep gloom of Rembrandt,\r\n      and the contempt of chiaroscuro peculiar to his rival, except\r\n      the contrast between the rapid sketchy touch of Hals and the\r\n      careful finish of Van der Helst.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture is dated 1647.\r\n\r\n\r\n146. A VIEW ON THE MAES.\r\n\r\n  _Abraham Storck_ (Dutch: 1630-1710).\r\n\r\n      About the life of this marine painter nothing is known. His\r\n      pictures usually represent views near Amsterdam, \"with a\r\n      variety of shipping and boats, and a number of small figures,\r\n      correctly drawn, and handled with spirit. His ships are well\r\n      drawn, his colouring clear and transparent, and his skies and\r\n      water light and floating\" (Bryan).\r\n\r\nRotterdam is seen in the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n147. CEPHALUS AND AURORA.\r\n\r\n\r\n148. THE TRIUMPH OF GALATEA.\r\n\r\n  _Agostino Carracci_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1557-1602).\r\n\r\n      Agostino was the elder brother of Annibale Carracci (see\r\n      under 9) and cousin of Lodovico (see under 28). It was he\r\n      who composed the well-known sonnet in which the aims of the\r\n      Eclectic School are set forth. He was the most learned of the\r\n      Carracci, being painter, engraver, poet, and musician, and\r\n      well versed in the arts and sciences generally. His pictures\r\n      are rare. The best is the \"Communion of St. Jerome\" in the\r\n      Academy at Bologna. His prints are numerous; his engraving\r\n      of Tintoretto's \"Crucifixion,\" executed at Venice in 1589,\r\n      was highly praised by that artist. In the same year Agostino\r\n      returned to Bologna, and became the principal teacher in the\r\n      school of the Carracci. He afterwards went to Rome to assist\r\n      Annibale in the frescoes for the Farnese Palace. He executed\r\n      the \"Cephalus and Aurora\" and \"Galatea\" in that series; his\r\n      success excited the jealousy of Annibale, and caused a feud\r\n      between the two brothers. Agostino thereupon left Rome for\r\n      Parma, where he died shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nThese are the cartoons made by Agostino for the frescoes referred\r\nto above. They formed part of Sir Thomas Lawrence's collection of\r\ndrawings. In 147, Cephalus, while on a hunting expedition on Mount\r\nHymettus, is forcibly carried off by Aurora. The aged Tithonus, her\r\nhusband, is sleeping in the foreground. In 148, the sea-nymph Galatea\r\nis borne on the ocean by Glaucus, preceded by Triton blowing his horn,\r\nand surrounded by Nereids and Cupids on Dolphins.\r\n\r\n\r\n149. A CALM AT SEA.\r\n\r\n  _Willem van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1633-1707).\r\n\r\n      William Van de Velde, the younger, was the son of an artist\r\n      of the same name, and the two together were the most famous\r\n      sea-painters of their time. The father was specially\r\n      commissioned by the East India Company to paint several of\r\n      their ships. The son was for a time engaged in painting the\r\n      chief naval battles of the Dutch. In 1675 they were both\r\n      established in England, living at Greenwich, as painters\r\n      to King Charles II., who granted each of them a pension of\r\n      £100 a year; the father \"for taking and making draughts of\r\n      sea-fights\"; and the son \"for putting the said draughts into\r\n      colours.\" The Vandeveldes, thus employed, \"produced,\" says\r\n      Macaulay, \"for the king and his nobles some of the finest\r\n      sea-pieces in the world.\" \"The palm,\" says Walpole, \"is not\r\n      less disputed with Raphael for history than with Vandevelde\r\n      for sea-pieces.\" But in no branch of art has the English\r\n      School of this century made more conspicuous advance than in\r\n      sea-painting, and those who are fresh from reminiscences of\r\n      Turner or Lee, or, amongst later artists, of Hook and Moore\r\n      and Brett, will hardly be inclined to agree at this day with\r\n      such high praise of Vandevelde. \"It is not easily understood,\"\r\n      says Ruskin, \"considering how many there are who love the sea,\r\n      and look at it, that Vandevelde and such others should be\r\n      tolerated. Foam appears to me to curdle and cream on the wave\r\n      sides, and to fly flashing from their crests, and not to be\r\n      set astride upon them like a peruke; and waves appear to me to\r\n      fall, and plunge, and toss, and nod, and crash over, and not\r\n      to curl up like shavings; and water appears to me, when it is\r\n      grey, to have the grey of stormy air mixed with its own deep,\r\n      heavy, thunderous, threatening blue, and not the grey of the\r\n      first coat of cheap paint on a deal floor.\"\r\n\r\n      \"It is not easy to understand,\" perhaps, but two helps towards\r\n      understanding may be mentioned in Ruskin's own words. First,\r\n      previous painters--including even the Venetians, sea-folk\r\n      though they were--had all treated the sea conventionally.\r\n      Vandevelde and his fellows, at any rate, endeavoured to study\r\n      it from nature. Bakhuizen, as we shall see, like Turner\r\n      after him, used to go to sea in all weathers, the better to\r\n      obtain \"impressions.\" Hence the Dutch sea-painting did mark\r\n      an advance, and how great was its influence on later artists\r\n      and sea-lovers we know from the case of Turner, who \"painted\r\n      many pictures in the manner of Vandevelde, and always painted\r\n      the sea too grey, and too opaque, in consequence of his early\r\n      study of him.\" And this grey and opaque rendering of the sea by\r\n      the Dutch was to some extent due to natural causes. \"Although\r\n      in artistical qualities lower than is easily by language\r\n      expressible, the Italian marine painting usually conveys an\r\n      idea of three facts about the sea,--that it is green, that\r\n      it is deep, and that the sun shines on it. The dark plain\r\n      which stands for far-away Adriatic with the Venetians, and\r\n      the glinting swells of tamed wave which lap about the quays\r\n      of Claude, agree in giving the general impression that the\r\n      ocean consists of pure water, and is open to the pure sky. But\r\n      the Dutch painters, while they attained considerably greater\r\n      dexterity than the Italian in mere delineation of nautical\r\n      incident, were by nature precluded from ever becoming aware of\r\n      these common facts; and having, in reality, never in all their\r\n      lives seen the sea, but only a shallow mixture of sea-water\r\n      and sand; and also never in all their lives seen the sky, but\r\n      only a lower element between them and it, composed of marsh\r\n      exhalation and fog-bank,--they are not to be with too great\r\n      severity reproached for the dulness of their records of the\r\n      nautical enterprise of Holland. _We_ only are to be reproached,\r\n      who, familiar with the Atlantic, are yet ready to accept with\r\n      faith, as types of sea, the small waves _en papillote_ and\r\n      peruke-like puffs of farinaceous foam, which were the delight\r\n      of Bakhuizen and his compeers\"[97] (_Modern Painters_, vol. i.\r\n      pt. ii. sec. v. ch. i. § 20; vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. xviii. § 30;\r\n      _On the Old Road_, i. 283; _Harbours of England_, p. 18). The\r\n      storms of Van der Velde are certainly unattractive, but the\r\n      silvery daylight of his \"calms at sea\" gives to many of his\r\n      works an enduring charm. This painter is well represented both\r\n      in the Dulwich Gallery and in the Wallace collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n150.

A RIVER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Goyen_ (Dutch: 1596-1656). _See_ 137.\r\n\r\nSigned with the artist's name, and dated 1645.\r\n\r\n\r\n152. AN EVENING LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Aart van der Neer_ (Dutch: 1603-1677).\r\n\r\n      This painter was a native of Amsterdam, and lived and worked\r\n      there. His pictures are now much appreciated; but he died\r\n      destitute, and the pictures he left behind him were valued at\r\n      only three florins apiece.\r\n\r\nAart (Arthur) van der Neer is the Dutch painter of \"the hues and\r\nharmonies of evening.\" Before the door of the country house are a lady\r\nand gentleman, who have come out as if to gaze on one of such effects.\r\nThis is one of the largest of his pictures--which is the more valuable\r\nas the figures are by Cuyp, whose name is inscribed on the pail; but\r\n239 is perhaps more attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n153. THE CRADLE.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Maes_ (Dutch: 1632-1693).\r\n\r\n      Maes (or, in more modern form, Maas), was a pupil of Rembrandt,\r\n      and ranks high among Dutch masters, being distinguished from\r\n      many of the _genre_ painters by his richer colouring. \"He\r\n      assimilated the principles of his master,\" says Sir. F. Burton,\r\n      \"without adopting his subjects. In the class of pictures by\r\n      which he is best known, namely, indoor scenes taken from\r\n      ordinary life, he unites subtlety of chiaroscuro, vigorous\r\n      colour, and great mastery in handling, with that true finish\r\n      which never becomes trivial. The figures are finely drawn, and\r\n      their action is perfect. Harmonies of red and black prevail\r\n      in these works--sometimes pervading the picture in subdued\r\n      tones; sometimes brought out in full contrasting force against\r\n      white. The smaller pictures by Maes in this Gallery are among\r\n      the finest examples of the former mode of treatment.\" Maes\r\n      entered Rembrandt's studio in 1650 and remained there four\r\n      years. He then returned to Dort, his native town, where he\r\n      lived till 1678. In that year he moved to Amsterdam, where he\r\n      remained to the end of his life, and was employed by most of\r\n      the distinguished persons of his time. In these latter years\r\n      he was mostly engaged in portraits. His earlier portraits (of\r\n      which No. 1277 is a good specimen) are worthy of a pupil of\r\n      Rembrandt. The later portraits are so different in style and\r\n      inferior in quality that some critics ascribe them to the\r\n      painter's son or some other artist of the same name. \"Maes's\r\n      favourite colour,\" says Havard, \"was red. No artist uses this\r\n      colour with more boldness or more success than he does in his\r\n      earlier works [note, _e.g._ the crimson curtain which forms the\r\n      background in 1277]. For this reason doubts have been raised if\r\n      he ever painted the series of large bewigged portraits which\r\n      have been attributed to him, sombre and morose faces, uniformly\r\n      set against a dark background. It is difficult to imagine the\r\n      brilliant painter of 'The Cradle' forgetting his skill in light\r\n      and shade and his love of nature, to give himself up, as in\r\n      these commonplace productions, to mannerism and affectation\"\r\n      (_The Dutch School_, p. 100).\r\n\r\n\r\n154. A MUSIC PARTY.\r\n\r\n  _David Teniers, the younger_ (Flemish: 1610-1694).\r\n\r\n      Teniers, though a Fleming by birth, belongs rather to the\r\n      Dutch School in style--being one of the principal _genre_\r\n      painters, of whom most of the other leading masters are Dutch.\r\n      His art stands, however, in direct relation to that of the\r\n      Flemish painters preceding him, through the want of spiritual\r\n      motive common to him and to them. But Teniers and the _genre_\r\n      painters carry this banishment of spiritual motive a step\r\n      further. \"Rubens often gives instructive and magnificent\r\n      allegory. Rembrandt, pathetic or powerful fancies, founded on\r\n      real Scripture-reading, and on his interest in the picturesque\r\n      character of the Jew. And Van Dyck, a graceful rendering of\r\n      received Scriptural legends. But (with Teniers) ... we lose,\r\n      not only all faith in religion, but all remembrance of it.\r\n      Absolutely now at last we find ourselves without sight of God\r\n      in all the world.... Farthest savages had, and still have,\r\n      their Great Spirit, or, in extremity, their feather-idols,\r\n      large-eyed; but here in Holland we have at last got utterly\r\n      done with it all. Our only idol glitters dimly, in tangible\r\n      shape of a pint pot, and all the incense offered thereto comes\r\n      out of a small censer or bowl at the end of a pipe.\" The\r\n      place of Teniers in art history is, therefore, so far as the\r\n      ideals of art go, that he is, _par excellence_, \"the painter\r\n      of the pleasures of the ale-house and card-table\" (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. §§ 10, 11; ch. viii. § 11).\r\n      He did, indeed, occasionally venture on the ground of religious\r\n      painting; but his essays in this sort are absurd. His devotion\r\n      to _genre_ entirely hit the taste of his time, and his fame was\r\n      rapid and enduring. He was taught the rudiments of art by his\r\n      father, David Teniers, the elder, a mediocre painter of small\r\n      rustic subjects (see 949); but his real masters were Rubens and\r\n      Brouwer, though he did not actually study with them. In 1633,\r\n      at the age of twenty-three, he received the dignity of master.\r\n      Four years later he married the daughter of Velvet Breughel,\r\n      the former ward of Rubens, who acted as witness at the marriage\r\n      ceremony. His talents were in universal request. The Archduke\r\n      Leopold-William, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, appointed\r\n      him his private painter, and gave him an office in his\r\n      household. Queen Christina of Sweden and King Philip IV. of\r\n      Spain were amongst his patrons. He gave Don Juan of Austria\r\n      lessons in painting, and this prince painted the portrait of\r\n      Teniers's son, and presented it to the master as a token of his\r\n      regard. In 1644 he was chosen to preside over the Antwerp Guild\r\n      of Painters. In 1647 he took up his abode in Brussels. His\r\n      country-seat at Perck (see 817) was a constant resort of the\r\n      Spanish and Flemish nobility. Shortly after the death of his\r\n      first wife in 1656 he married Isabella de Fren, daughter of the\r\n      Secretary of the Council of Brabant, and he strove his utmost\r\n      to prove his right to armorial bearings. The king declared his\r\n      readiness to grant the request, but only on condition that\r\n      Teniers should give up selling his pictures. Teniers did not\r\n      accept the condition, and transferred his energies to procuring\r\n      a charter for an Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp to which\r\n      artists should alone be admitted, whereas the former Guild of\r\n      St. Luke made no distinction between art and handicraft.\r\n\r\n      The aristocratic leanings of Teniers may be detected in his\r\n      pictures. He is indeed, as we have seen, \"the painter of the\r\n      ale-house.\" \"He depicted the manners of the Flemish rustic,\r\n      told of the intimacy of his domestic life and his happy, coarse\r\n      laughter. His folk go to market, clean out the stable, milk the\r\n      cows, raise the nets, sharpen knives, shoot off arrows, play\r\n      at nine-pins or cards, bind up wounds, pull out teeth, cure\r\n      bacon, make sausages, smoke, sing, dance, caress the girls,\r\n      and, above all things, drink, like the live Flemings they are.\"\r\n      Yet as compared with some other masters of _genre_, Teniers\r\n      seems to treat his rustics somewhat from the outside. Their\r\n      expressions are often exaggerated, and their gestures pass\r\n      into grimace. \"Brouwer knew more of taverns; Ostade was more\r\n      thoroughly at home in cottages.... Teniers seems anxious to\r\n      have it known that, far from indulging in the coarse amusements\r\n      of the boors he is fond of painting, he himself lives in good\r\n      style and looks like a gentleman. He never seems tired of\r\n      showing the turrets of his château of Perck, and in the midst\r\n      of rustic merry-makings we often see his family and himself\r\n      received cap in hand by the joyous peasants\" (_e.g._ in 817).\r\n      So too, though many of his interiors are very good, Teniers is\r\n      on the whole at his best in open-air scenes. In his skies he\r\n      has given (says Ruskin) \"some very wonderful passages\" (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. iii. ch. i. § 20; H. Hymans in\r\n      _Encyclopædia Britannica_; Wauters's _Flemish School_, p. 294).\r\n      Good examples of Teniers continue to be greatly appreciated.\r\n      The Belgian Government, for instance, gave £5000 in 1867 for\r\n      the \"Village Pastoral,\" now in Brussels Museum. The taste of\r\n      Teniers may justly be condemned; his technique will always\r\n      be admired. \"Take,\" says Ruskin, \"a picture by Teniers, of\r\n      sots quarrelling over their dice; it is an entirely clever\r\n      picture--so clever that nothing in its kind has ever been done\r\n      equal to it; but it is also an entirely base and evil picture.\r\n      It is an expression of delight in the prolonged contemplation\r\n      of a vile thing, and delight in that is an 'unmannered' or\r\n      'immoral' quality\" (_Crown of Wild Olive_, § 56). His bright\r\n      palette, his freshness of handling, his straightforwardness\r\n      in means and intent, give to the best works of Teniers a\r\n      permanent interest. He \"touched with a workmanly hand, such\r\n      as we cannot see rivalled now\"; and he seems \"never to have\r\n      painted indolently, but gave the purchaser his thorough money's\r\n      worth of mechanism.\" Hence it is that Sir Joshua Reynolds,\r\n      though condemning Teniers's vulgarity of subject, yet held\r\n      up his pictures as models to students who wished to excel in\r\n      execution. It should, however, be noted that his works vary\r\n      very much in this respect. Many of his later pictures are\r\n      painted so thinly that the ground is in places barely covered.\r\n      They have been called \"afternoons,\" not from their subject, but\r\n      from the time the painter took in producing them.\r\n\r\nThis and the companion picture, 158, are characteristic specimens of\r\nthe painter. The human specimens are ugly and vulgar; the pottery is\r\npretty, and beautifully painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n155. THE MONEY CHANGERS.\r\n\r\n  _Teniers_ (Flemish: 1610-1694). _See under_ last picture.\r\n\r\nA man and his wife--usurers, we may suppose--counting their money.\r\nThere is all the miser's misery in the withered careworn faces, all\r\nthe miser's greed in the thin, tremulous hands. The man alone seems\r\nnot quite to like some transaction which they are discussing; the\r\nwoman--Portia's prerogative of mercy being reversed--seems to be\r\nthinking, \"Come, man, don't be a fool: a bond is a bond.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n156. A STUDY OF HORSES.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See_ 49.\r\n\r\nAn interesting sketch as illustrating Van Dyck's affection for the\r\nhorse. \"In painting, I find that no real interest is taken in the\r\nhorse until Van Dyck's time, he and Rubens doing more for it than\r\nall previous painters put together. Rubens was a good rider, and\r\nrode nearly every day, as, I doubt not, Van Dyck also. The horse has\r\nnever, I think, been painted worthily again, since he died\" (_Modern\r\nPainters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. § 22).\r\n\r\nThe particular choice of subject in this sketch shows further in its\r\nliterary connection a lover of the horse. The subject, as we know\r\nfrom the words _equi Achillis_ on a scroll in the left corner of the\r\npicture, is the horses of Achilles, said for their swiftness to be the\r\nsons of the wind Zephyrus: in the upper part of the picture is a sketch\r\nof a zephyr's head. \"The gentleness of chivalry, properly so called,\r\ndepends on the recognition of the order and awe of lower and loftier\r\nanimal-life, ... taught most perfectly by Homer in the fable of the\r\nhorses of Achilles. There is, perhaps, in all the _Iliad_ nothing more\r\ndeep in significance--there is nothing in all literature more perfect\r\nin human tenderness, and honour for the mystery of inferior life,\r\nthan the verses that describe the sorrow of the divine horses at the\r\ndeath of Patroclus, and the comfort given them by the greatest of the\r\ngods\"[98] (_Fors Clavigera_, 1871, ix. 13).\r\n\r\n\r\n157.

Leslie\r\n(_Handbook for Young Painters_, p. 243), \"before which I find myself\r\nmore often standing than at this.\" Its great attraction, he adds, is\r\n\"the delight of seeing a trait of childhood we have often observed and\r\nbeen amused with in nature, for the first time so felicitously given by\r\nart.\" The Dutch housewife sits intently engaged in scraping a parsnip,\r\nwhilst the child stands by her side \"watching the process, as children\r\nwill stand and watch the most ordinary operations, with an intensity\r\nof interest, as if the very existence of the whole world depended on\r\nthe exact manner in which that parsnip was scraped.\" Note the Flemish\r\n_kruik_, or beer-jug, so often introduced into the pictures of Maes.\r\nSigned and dated 1655.\r\n\r\n\r\n160. A \"RIPOSO.\"\r\n\r\n  _Mola_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1612-1668). _See_ 69.\r\n\r\nThe Italians gave this title to the subject of the Holy Family resting\r\non the way in their flight to Egypt,--\"the angel of the Lord appeareth\r\nto Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his\r\nmother, and flee into Egypt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n161. AN ITALIAN LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Gaspard Poussin_ (French: 1613-1675). _See_ 31.\r\n\r\nGaspard travelled largely in Italy in search of the picturesque, and\r\nthis striking landscape may be a recollection of the mountain scenery\r\nin the North--possibly near Bergamo. The spray of foliage prominent on\r\nthe left is characteristic of Gaspard's method:--\r\n\r\n      \"One of the most remarkable characters of natural leafage is\r\n      the constancy with which, while the leaves are arranged on the\r\n      spray with exquisite regularity, that regularity is modified in\r\n      their actual effect. For as in every group of leaves some are\r\n      seen sideways, forming merely long lines, some foreshortened,\r\n      some crossing each other, every one differently turned and\r\n      placed from all the others, the forms of the leaves, though\r\n      in themselves similar, give rise to a thousand strange and\r\n      differing forms in the group.... Now go to Gaspard Poussin and\r\n      take one of his sprays, where they come against the sky; you\r\n      may count it all round: one, two, three, four, one bunch; five,\r\n      six, seven, eight, two bunches; nine, ten, eleven, twelve,\r\n      three bunches; with four leaves each; and such leaves! every\r\n      one precisely the same as its neighbour, blunt and round at\r\n      the end (where every forest leaf is sharp, except that of the\r\n      fig-tree), tied together by the stalks, and so fastened on to\r\n      the demoniacal claws above described (see under 68), one bunch\r\n      to each claw\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. vi. ch.\r\n      i. §§ 16, 17).\r\n\r\n\r\n163. VENICE: A VIEW ON THE GRAND CANAL.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See_ 127.\r\n\r\nThe Church, that of S. Simeone Piccolo, was built in Canaletto's time.\r\n\"One of the ugliest churches in Venice or elsewhere. Its black dome,\r\nlike an unusual species of gasometer, is the admiration of modern\r\nItalian architects\" (_Stones of Venice_, vol. iii. Venetian Index, _s.\r\nv._ Simeone).\r\n\r\n\r\n165. THE PLAGUE AT ASHDOD.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Poussin_ (French: 1593-1665). _See_ 39.\r\n\r\nThe Philistines having overcome the Israelites removed the ark of the\r\nLord to Ashdod, and placed it in the temple of their god Dagon. \"And\r\nwhen they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen\r\nupon his face to the earth before the ark ...\" (seen here in the temple\r\nto the right). \"But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod,\r\nand he smote them with a loathsome plague\" (1 Samuel v. 4, 6).\r\n\r\nThe picture--a ghastly subject ghastlily treated--is yet a good\r\ninstance of Poussin's learned treatment. Everywhere the intention to\r\nexpress alarm is obvious, and in the foreground are figures fleeing the\r\ninfection, with nose and mouth muffled. Others are engaged removing the\r\ndead and dying, while in the centre are the dead bodies of a mother and\r\nchild; another child approaches the mother's breast, but the father\r\nstoops down to avert it. A similar group to this occurs in a design\r\nby Raphael, \"Il Morbetto,\" and was also in the celebrated picture by\r\nAristides which Alexander the Great, at the sack of Thebes, claimed for\r\nhimself and sent to his palace at Pella (Wornum: _Epochs of Painting_,\r\np. 47, ed. 1864). This picture is a replica of one, now in the Louvre,\r\nwhich was painted in Rome in 1630--Poussin receiving only 60 scudi\r\n(about 12 guineas) for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n166. A CAPUCHIN FRIAR.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45.\r\n\r\nMichel ascribes this portrait to the year of Rembrandt's tribulations.\r\n\"At this period, when his emotions were so deeply stirred by the\r\nvision of a compassionate Saviour, he felt a kindred attraction for\r\nthose mystic souls who sought in solitude and prayer a closer communion\r\nwith the Christ to whom he felt himself drawn by his own sorrows. The\r\n'Capuchin' in the National Gallery has suffered from time, but the\r\ndevout gravity of the face is finely expressed\" (_Rembrandt: his Life,\r\nhis Work, and his Time_, ii. 126).\r\n\r\n\r\n167. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Peruzzi_ (Sienese: 1481-1537). _See_ 218.\r\n\r\nThis drawing--of the same composition as we see in the picture\r\nNo. 218--was made at Bologna in 1521 for Count Giovanni Battista\r\nBentivogli. The drawing was presented to the National Gallery by Lord\r\nVernon, together with a print from the plate engraved from it by\r\nAgostino Carracci.\r\n\r\n\r\n168. ST. CATHERINE OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n  _Raphael_ (Urbino: 1483-1520). _See_ 1171.\r\n\r\n      This is a picture of Raphael's second period--\"painted about\r\n      the year 1507, to judge from its close resemblance in style\r\n      to the celebrated picture of the Entombment in the Borghese\r\n      (Rome), which is known to have been executed at that time.\"\r\n      There are several studies for the picture in the University\r\n      Galleries at Oxford, and another in the Chatsworth collection.\r\n      The finished cartoon in black and white chalk, pricked for\r\n      transfer to the panel, is exhibited in the Louvre.\r\n\r\nA perfect picture of saintly resignation. St. Catherine (for whose\r\nstory see 693) leans on the wheel, the instrument of her martyrdom,\r\nand \"looks up to heaven in the dawn of the eternal day, with her lips\r\nparted in the resting from her pain.\" Her right hand is pressed on her\r\nbosom, as if she replied to the call from above, \"I am here, O Lord!\r\nready to do Thy will.\" From above, a bright ray is seen streaming\r\ndown upon her, emblematic of the divine inspiration which enabled\r\nher to confound her heathen adversaries. The studies existing show\r\nthe pains Raphael took with the exquisite expression; but the result\r\ndefies analysis. \"It is impossible to explain in language the exact\r\nqualities of the lines on which depend the whole truth and beauty of\r\nexpression about the half-opened lips of Raphael's St. Catherine.\" But\r\nthese lines should be noticed as exemplifying the principle of \"vital\r\nbeauty\"--of beauty, that is to say, as consisting in the appearance\r\nin living things of felicitous fulfilment of function. Thus eyes and\r\nmouths become more beautiful precisely as they become more perfect\r\nmeans of moral expression. The mouth of a negro is ugly because it is\r\nonly a means of eating; the mouth of St. Catherine is beautiful for the\r\nfeeling it expresses (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch.\r\nvii. § 47; vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. xii. § 10, sec. ii. ch. v. §\r\n21). It may be noticed, lastly, how much the pathetic feeling of the\r\npicture is heightened by the herbage in the foreground, and especially\r\nperhaps by the carefully-painted dandelion \"clock\": \"so soon passeth it\r\naway, and we are gone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n169. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Ludovico Mazzolino_ (Ferrarese: 1480-1528).\r\n\r\n      Ludovico Mazzolino, \"whose brilliant colours play through\r\n      all shades,\" has been called \"the glowworm of the Ferrarese\r\n      School;\" creamy-toned backgrounds of architectural subjects\r\n      also enrich his compositions. \"He was principally a _genre_\r\n      painter, though in his early period he is said to have worked\r\n      much in fresco. His brilliant colouring made him a favourite\r\n      with art-loving prelates of succeeding generations; hence\r\n      his small pictures abound in Roman collections\" (_Italian\r\n      Painters_, Borghese Gallery, p. 219). Morelli elsewhere adds\r\n      the conjecture that Mazzolino studied at Ferrara under Domenico\r\n      Pannetti. In another of his characteristics--the minuteness,\r\n      namely, of his work--he resembles rather the Flemish School.\r\n      Of his life little or nothing is known; but his interest in\r\n      decorative craftsmanship is proved by his pictures.\r\n\r\nThe background and accessories here, as well as in 641, are\r\nparticularly interesting as a record of the decorative art of the\r\ntime. A few years before the date of these pictures the Pope Leo X.\r\nhad unearthed the buried treasures of the Baths of Titus, and Giovanni\r\nda Udine rediscovered the mode by which their stucco decorations were\r\nproduced. This method of modelling in wet plaster on walls and ceilings\r\nwas extensively used in house decoration from that time down to the\r\nmiddle of the last century, but has since then been supplanted by the\r\ncheaper process of casting. No sooner was Giovanni da Udine's invention\r\nknown than it must have been adopted by Ferrarese artists, for here we\r\nfind Mazzolino portraying it in the background of his picture. As in\r\nTura's pilaster (see 772), the winged sphere plays a principal part in\r\nthe design, for it was a favourite badge of the ducal house of Ferrara.\r\nNor is it only in the plaster modelling that Mazzolino's interest in\r\ndecorative art shows itself. The back of the bench on which the Madonna\r\nsits is crowned by the most delicate carving, whilst up aloft, peeping\r\nover the wall on which the plaster work occurs, there is a choir of\r\nangels playing on a portable organ, which is full of suggestions for\r\ndecorative design (G. T. Robinson in _Art Journal_, May 1886, pp. 151,\r\n152).\r\n\r\n\r\n170. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Garofalo_ (Ferrarese; 1481-1559). _See_ 81.\r\n\r\nNotice the rich cap in which the little St. John is dressed; it is not\r\nunlike those which French and Flemish children are still made to wear\r\nas a protection from tumbles. There is a grace in the figures of the\r\nVirgin and St. Elizabeth which recalls Raphael. A less happy effect of\r\nhis influence may be seen in the vision of the heavenly host above,\r\nfull of that exaggerated action which marks the decadence of Italian\r\nart. God the Father is represented gesticulating wildly, almost like an\r\nactor in melodrama. And so with the playing angels. In pictures of the\r\ngreat time they are shown \"with uninterrupted and effortless\r\ngesture ... singing as calmly as the Fates weave\" (_Relation between\r\nMichael Angelo and Tintoret_, p. 15), but here they are all scrambling\r\nthrough their songs, their hair floating in the breeze and their faces\r\nfull of excited gesture.\r\n\r\n\r\n172. THE SUPPER AT EMMAUS.\r\n\r\n  _Caravaggio_ (Naturalist: 1569-1609).\r\n\r\n      Michael Angelo Amerighi, the son of a mason, is usually called\r\n      Caravaggio from his birthplace, a town of that name near\r\n      Milan.[99] He was the leader of the so-called \"Naturalist\"\r\n      School (see introduction to \"The Later Italian Schools\"),\r\n      which numbered among its disciples Spagnoletto (235) and the\r\n      Dutch Gerard von Honthorst (1444). The characteristics of his\r\n      art, as described below, were not out of keeping with the\r\n      sombre character of the man.[100] He had established himself\r\n      as a painter at Rome, when he had to fly for homicide. He was\r\n      playing at tennis and became so violent in a dispute that he\r\n      killed his companion. After a short stay at Naples he went to\r\n      Malta, where he gained the favour of the grand-master, and was\r\n      made a Knight of the Cross of Malta. His ungovernable temper,\r\n      however, again led him into trouble, and quarrelling with one\r\n      of the knights, he was cast into prison. He escaped to Sicily\r\n      and thence returned to Naples. Having procured the Pope's\r\n      pardon for his original offence, he hired a felucca and set\r\n      sail for Rome. The coast-guard arrested him in mistake for\r\n      another person; the crew of the felucca plundered him of all\r\n      his belongings; and after wandering disconsolately along the\r\n      coast, he was seized with fever, and died at the early age of\r\n      forty.\r\n\r\nOne notices first in this picture the least important things--the\r\nsupper before the company, the roast chicken before Christ. Next one\r\nsees how coarse and almost ruffianly are the disciples, represented\r\nas supping with their risen Lord at Emmaus (Luke xxiv. 30, 31). Both\r\npoints are characteristic of the painter, who was driven by the\r\ninsipidities of the preceding mannerists into a crude \"realism,\" which\r\nmade him resolve to describe sacred and historical events just as\r\nthough they were being enacted in a slum by butchers and fishwives.\r\n\"He was led away,\" says Lanzi (i. 452), \"by his sombre genius, and\r\nrepresented objects with very little light. He ridiculed all artists\r\nwho attempted a noble expression of countenance or graceful folding of\r\ndrapery.\" His first altar-piece was removed by the priests for whom it\r\nwas painted, as being too vulgar for such a subject. \"Many interesting\r\nstudies from the taverns of Italy remain to prove Caravaggio's\r\nmastery over scenes of common life. For the historian of manners in\r\nseventeenth-century Italy, those pictures have a truly precious value,\r\nas they are executed with such passion as to raise them above the more\r\ncareful but more lymphatic transcripts from beer-cellars in Dutch\r\npainting. But when he applied his principles to higher subjects, then\r\nvulgarity became apparent. It seems difficult for realism, either\r\nin literature or art, not to fasten upon ugliness, vice, pain, and\r\ndisease, as though these imperfections of our nature were more real\r\nthan beauty, goodness, pleasure, and health. Therefore Caravaggio, the\r\nleader of a school which the Italians christened Naturalists, may be\r\ncompared to Zola\" (_Symonds_, vii. 221).\r\n\r\n\r\n173. PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Bassano_ (Venetian: 1510-1592).\r\n\r\n      Jacopo da Ponte is commonly called Il Bassano or Jacopo\r\n      da Bassano from his native town, near Venice. His father,\r\n      Francesco, who was a painter in the school of the Bellini, was\r\n      his first master; he afterwards studied under Bonifazio at\r\n      Venice. After a short stay in that city, Jacopo returned to his\r\n      native town, where he remained for the rest of a long life.\r\n      \"His best works are almost worthy,\" says Sir F. Burton, \"of\r\n      Titian. They are conspicuous among other qualities for Venetian\r\n      excellence of colouring--especially in his green, where he\r\n      exhibits a peculiar brilliancy. Most of his pictures seem at\r\n      first sight as dazzling, then as cooling and soothing, as the\r\n      best kind of stained glass; while the colouring of details,\r\n      particularly of those under high lights, is jewel-like, as\r\n      clear and deep and satisfying as rubies and emeralds.\" No. 228\r\n      in this Collection has passages which illustrate this point.\r\n      Jacopo was nearly contemporary with the great Tintoretto, but\r\n      while the latter was the last of the Venetian painters in the\r\n      grand style, Bassano after a time devoted himself to simple\r\n      scenes of country life. His distinguishing place in the history\r\n      of art is that he was the first Italian painter of _genre_--a\r\n      painter, that is, _du genre bas_, painter of a low class of\r\n      subjects, of familiar objects such as do not belong to any\r\n      other recognised class of paintings (as history, portrait,\r\n      etc.): see, for instance, No. 228, in which the religious\r\n      subject merely gives the painter an opportunity for a scene\r\n      of market life. \"His pictures were for the inhabitants of the\r\n      small market-town from which he takes his name, where, besides\r\n      the gates, you still see men and women in rustic garb crouching\r\n      over their many-coloured wares; and where, just outside the\r\n      walls, you may see all the ordinary occupations connected\r\n      with farming and grazing. Inspired, although unawares, by\r\n      the new idea of giving perfectly modern versions of Biblical\r\n      stories, Bassano introduced into nearly every picture he\r\n      painted episodes from the life in the streets of Bassano and\r\n      in the country just outside the gates. Another thing Bassano\r\n      could not fail to do, working as he did in the country and\r\n      for country people, was to paint landscape. He loved to paint\r\n      the real country. He was, in fact, the first modern landscape\r\n      painter\" (Berenson: _Venetian Painters of the Renaissance_, §\r\n      xxi). \"Giovanni Bellini places his figure in the crystal air\r\n      of an Italian morning; Titian and Tintoretto give us daylight,\r\n      mighty while subdued; but Bassano throws a lurid grey over his\r\n      landscape and carries the eye to the solemn twilight spread\r\n      along the distant horizon. This peculiarity of feature is\r\n      partly accounted for by the position of the town of Bassano,\r\n      which is wrapped in an early twilight by the high mountains\r\n      above it on the west\" (Layard's edition of _Kugler_, ii. 624).\r\n\r\nA fine portrait--somewhat recalling Rembrandt in style--of a very\r\nrefined face. In the vase beside him is a sprig of myrtle. This painter\r\nis fond of introducing such vases: see one in 277. In the principal\r\nstreet of Bassano, where the artist was born and, after studying at\r\nVenice, continued to live, such vessels may still be seen placed out\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n174. PORTRAIT OF CARDINAL CERRI.\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Maratti_ (Roman: 1625-1713).\r\n\r\n      Carlo Maratti (called also Carlo delle Madonne, from the large\r\n      number of Madonna pictures that he painted) was an imitator of\r\n      Raphael, and for nearly half a century the most eminent painter\r\n      in Rome. The portrait of a cardinal should have come kindly\r\n      to him, for he was in the service of several popes, and was\r\n      appointed superintendent of the Vatican Chambers by Innocent XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n176. ST. JOHN AND THE LAMB.\r\n\r\n  _Murillo_ (Spanish: 1618-1682). _See 13._\r\n\r\nAn interesting illustration of the substitution of the palpable image\r\nfor the figurative phrase. The mission of St. John the Baptist was to\r\nprepare the way for Christ, to proclaim to the people \"Behold the Lamb\r\nof God!\" Murillo makes the standard of the Lamb, with those words upon\r\nit, lie upon the ground below; but he further represents the young St.\r\nJohn as embracing an actual lamb.\r\n\r\n\r\n177. THE MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Guido_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1575-1642). _See 11._\r\n\r\nJust such a picture as might have suggested the lines in Pope's epistle\r\non \"The Characters of Women\"--\r\n\r\n    Let then the fair one beautifully cry,\r\n    In Magdalen's loose hair and lifted eye;\r\n    Or dress'd in smiles of sweet Cecilia shine,\r\n    With simpering angels, palms, and harps divine;\r\n    Whether the charmer sinner it, or saint it,\r\n    If folly grow romantic, I must paint it.\r\n\r\nJust such a picture, too, as Guido turned out in numbers. \"He was\r\nspecially fond,\" says one of his biographers, \"of depicting faces with\r\nupraised looks, and he used to say that he had a hundred different\r\nmodes\" of thus supplying sentimentality to order.\r\n\r\n\r\n179. VIRGIN AND CHILD ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n\r\n180. A PIETÀ.\r\n\r\n  _Francia_ (Ferrarese-Bolognese: 1450-1517).\r\n\r\n      Of Francesco Raibolini's life the two most interesting things\r\n      are these: first, that great artist though he came to be,\r\n      he never painted a picture, so far as we know, till he was\r\n      forty; and secondly, the intimate connection, exemplified in\r\n      him, between the artist and the craftsman. He was the son of\r\n      a carpenter, and, like so many of the greatest old masters,\r\n      was brought up to the goldsmith's trade. The name of Francia\r\n      was that of his master in goldsmith's work, and was adopted by\r\n      him in gratitude.[101] He attained great skill in his trade,\r\n      especially as a die-engraver and a worker in \"niello\" (inlaying\r\n      a black composition into steel or silver). He was appointed\r\n      steward of the Goldsmiths' Guild in 1483, and afterwards became\r\n      master of the Mint--a post which he held till his death.\r\n      In some of his earlier pictures the hand of a goldsmith is\r\n      seen--in the clear outline, the metallic and polished surface,\r\n      and the minuteness of detail; and even on some of his later\r\n      and more important works, such as 179, he signed himself\r\n      \"Francia _aurifex_ (goldsmith) Bononiensis.\" It was with Costa,\r\n      the Ferrarese artist (see 629), who migrated to Bologna, and\r\n      with whom he entered into partnership, that Francia learnt\r\n      the art of painting, and thus, though a Bolognese, he is\r\n      properly included in the Ferrarese School. His work marks the\r\n      culminating point of that school, just as Raphael's[102] marks\r\n      that of the Umbrian, and in these pictures (originally one\r\n      altar-piece, painted for the Buonvisi chapel in S. Frediano\r\n      at Lucca, where, says Vasari, it was held to be of great\r\n      value) we have some of his best work. Many of his pictures are\r\n      still at Bologna, including the one which some consider his\r\n      _chef d'oeuvre_, the Bentivoglio altar-piece in S. Giacomo\r\n      Maggiore. Francia is the most pathetic of painters. Raphael\r\n      is said to have remarked that Francia's Madonnas were the most\r\n      devoutly beautiful he knew,[103] and there is considerable\r\n      affinity between Francia and Perugino. But the Umbrian master\r\n      was more ideal; in Francia there are touches of realism. \"It\r\n      will be observed in No. 180 that the Virgin is represented as\r\n      a middle-aged woman, and that the lids of the angels' eyes are\r\n      red with weeping. In spirit also they are different. Francia\r\n      makes his angels appeal to the spectator as if to enlist his\r\n      sympathy in the pathos of the tragedy, holding up the beautiful\r\n      tresses of Christ's hair to aid in the appeal. This Perugino\r\n      would never have done; his angels, and his saints also, are\r\n      always wrapt in a spiritual ecstasy to which Francia could not\r\n      attain\" (Monkhouse: _In the National Gallery_, p. 173).\r\n\r\n(179) On the throne are the Virgin and her mother, St. Anne, who offers\r\nthe infant Christ a peach, symbolical, as the fruit thus offered in\r\nthese pictures originally was, of \"the fruits of the spirit--joy,\r\npeace, and love.\" At the foot of the throne stands the little St. John\r\n(the Baptist), \"one of the purest creations of Christian art,\" holding\r\nin his arms the cross of reeds and the scroll inscribed \"Ecce Agnus\r\nDei\" (\"Behold the Lamb of God\"). The discovery of Benedetto Buonvisi's\r\nwill has shown why the various saints were selected--St. Anne, because\r\nthe Buonvisi chapel was dedicated to her; St. Lawrence as the patron of\r\nthe founder's father; St. Paul as the patron of the founder's brother\r\nand heir; St. Sebastian as the saint invoked in plagues (from which\r\ncalamity Lucca suffered in 1510); and St. Benedict as the patron of the\r\nfounder (G. C. Williamson's _Francia_, p. 111).\r\n\r\n(180) This picture, which was the \"lunette,\" or arch, forming the top\r\nof the altar-piece, is a \"pietà,\" _i.e._ the Virgin and two angels\r\nweeping over the dead body of Christ. The artist has filled his picture\r\nwith that solemn reverential pity, harmonised by love, which befits\r\nhis subject. The body of Christ--utterly dead, yet not distorted nor\r\ndefaced by death--is that of a tired man whose great soul would not\r\nlet him rest while there was still His father's work to do on earth.\r\nIn the face of the angel at His head there is a look of quiet joy, as\r\nof one who knows that \"death is but a covered way that leads into the\r\nlight\"; in the attitude and expression of the angel at the feet there\r\nis prayerful sympathy for the sorrowing mother. The face of the mother\r\nherself, which before was pure and calm, is now tear-stained and sad,\r\nbecause her son has met so cruel a death--\r\n\r\n    What else in life seems piteous any more\r\n    After such pity?\r\n\r\nYet it bears a look of content because the world has known him. She\r\nrests His body tenderly on her knee as she did when he was a little\r\nchild--thus are \"the hues of the morning and the solemnity of eve,\r\nthe gladness in accomplished promise, and sorrow of the sword-pierced\r\nheart, gathered into one human Lamp of ineffable love\" (_Modern\r\nPainters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. v. § 21).\r\n\r\n\r\n181. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n  _Perugino_ (_Umbrian_: 1446-1523). _See 288._\r\n\r\nIf really by Perugino,[104] this must be one of his early works. It is\r\npainted in _tempera_. The Flemish process of oil-painting found its\r\nway to Venice, where Perugino is known to have been in 1494, and where\r\nhe probably learnt it. The superiority of the new method may be seen\r\nin a moment by comparing the cracked surface and faded colours of this\r\npicture with 288, which was painted when Perugino had obtained complete\r\nmastery over the new medium, and which is still as bright and fresh as\r\nwhen it was painted. The style of this picture is, however, thoroughly\r\nPeruginesque. It is interesting to compare the Umbrian type of the\r\nMadonna--innocent and girl-like, with an air of far-off reverie--with\r\nthe types of other schools. The Umbrian Madonna is less mature, more\r\netherealised than the Venetian. She is a girl, rather than a mother.\r\nTherein she resembles the Florentine type; but an air of dreamy reverie\r\nin the Umbrian takes the place of the intellectual mysticism of\r\nthe Florentine. In Perugino \"the Umbrian type finds its fullest and\r\nhighest representative. Dainty small features, all too babyish for\r\nthe figures that bear them; a mouth like a cupid's bow; a tiny and\r\ndelicate chin; eyes set well apart, with curiously heavy and drooping\r\nlids; faint pencilled eyebrows; a broad smooth forehead,--these are the\r\nmain elements in Perugino's Madonnas\" (Grant Allen in the _Pall Mall\r\nMagazine_, 1895, p. 620).\r\n\r\n\r\n184. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Lucidel_ (German: 1527-1590).\r\n\r\n      Lucidel (a name which is supposed to be a corruption of\r\n      Neufchatel) studied painting at Antwerp, and afterwards settled\r\n      at Nuremberg. This picture, dated 1561, was formally ascribed\r\n      to Sir Antonio More and supposed to represent Jeanne d'Archel;\r\n      but it reveals (says the latest edition of the Official\r\n      Catalogue) \"in its style and its Upper German costume, the\r\n      handiwork of Lucidel.\"\r\n\r\n\"The picture is much obscured,\" says Sir Edward Poynter, \"by a coarse\r\nbrown varnish. A beautiful example of this master, in the collection of\r\nLord Spencer, is remarkable for the purity of its colour, and doubtless\r\nthis portrait had originally the same qualities\" (_The National\r\nGallery_, i. 294).\r\n\r\n\r\n186. PORTRAITS OF JAN ARNOLFINI AND HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Eyck_ (Early Flemish: about 1390-1440).\r\n\r\n      The Van Eycks--Hubert, the elder brother, and Jan--were natives\r\n      of Maesyck (Eyck-sur-Meuse), and are famous as being the\r\n      artists to whose ingenuity the first invention of the art of\r\n      painting in oils was for a long time ascribed. The probability\r\n      is that although the practice of mixing oil with colours was\r\n      employed for decorative purposes in Germany and elsewhere long\r\n      before their time, they were the first to so improve it as to\r\n      make it fully serviceable for figure-painting.[105] The art of\r\n      oil painting reached higher perfection in many ways after their\r\n      time; but there is no picture in the Gallery which shows better\r\n      than this, one great capacity of oil painting--its combination,\r\n      namely, of \"imperishable firmness with exquisite delicacy\"\r\n      (_On the Old Road_, i. 141). The place of the Van Eycks in\r\n      the development of early Flemish art has been described in\r\n      the introduction to that School, but the suddenness and\r\n      completeness of their mastery remains among the wonders of\r\n      painting. \"The first Italian Renaissance,\" says Fromentin,\r\n      \"has nothing comparable to this. And in the particular order\r\n      of sentiments they expressed and of the subjects they chose,\r\n      one must admit that neither any Lombard School, nor Tuscan, nor\r\n      Venetian, produced anything that resembles the first outburst\r\n      of the School of Bruges.\" The two brothers were granted the\r\n      freedom of the profession by the Corporation of Painters\r\n      of Ghent in 1421. In that year Jan left Hubert and took an\r\n      appointment as painter to Count John of Bavaria at the Hague.\r\n      In 1424 he returned to Bruges as painter to Philip, Duke of\r\n      Burgundy, in whose service he remained to the end of his life.\r\n      Like Rubens, the painter Jan van Eyck \"amused himself with\r\n      being ambassador.\" \"He was frequently employed on missions of\r\n      trust; and following the fortunes of a chief who was always in\r\n      the saddle, he appears for a time to have been in ceaseless\r\n      motion, receiving extra pay for secret services at Leyden,\r\n      drawing his salary at Bruges, yet settled in a fixed abode at\r\n      Lille. In 1428 he joined the embassy sent by Philip the Good to\r\n      Lisbon to beg the hand of Isabella of Portugal. His portrait of\r\n      the bride fixed the Duke's choice. After his return he settled\r\n      finally at Bruges, where he married, and his wife bore him\r\n      a daughter, known in after years as a nun in the convent of\r\n      Maesyck. At the christening of this child the Duke was sponsor;\r\n      and this was but one of the many distinctions by which Philip\r\n      the Good rewarded his painter's merits\" (Crowe). But never was\r\n      there an artist less puffed up. \"Jan van Eyck was here.\" \"As\r\n      I can, not as I would.\" Such signatures are the sign-marks of\r\n      modesty. In 1426 his brother Hubert died, leaving the great\r\n      altar-piece--the Adoration of the Lamb--for Jan to finish.\r\n      This masterpiece of the Van Eycks was in 1432 set up in the\r\n      Chapel of St. Bavon at Ghent, where the central portions still\r\n      remain--the other original panels being now at Brussels and\r\n      Berlin. The portraits by Jan in our Gallery belong to the next\r\n      three years. There are no finer specimens of his marvellous\r\n      precision and delicacy in this branch of the art.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful picture of a Flemish interior--dated 1434--is as spruce\r\nand clean now (for the small twig broom did its work so well that the\r\ngoodman and his wife were not afraid to walk on the polished floor\r\nwithout their shoes), as it was when first painted five hundred years\r\nago. This is the more interesting from the eventful history the picture\r\nhas had. At one time we hear of a barber-surgeon at Bruges presenting\r\nit to the Queen-regent of the Netherlands, who valued it so highly\r\nthat she pensioned him in return for the gift. At another it must have\r\npassed again into humbler hands, for General Hay found it in the room\r\nto which he was taken in 1815 at Brussels to recover from wounds at\r\nthe battle of Waterloo. He purchased the picture after his recovery,\r\nand sold it to the British Government in 1842. \"It is,\" says Sir\r\nEdward Poynter, \"one of the most precious possessions in the national\r\ncollection, and, in respect of its marvellous finish, combined with\r\nthe most astounding truth of imitation and effect, perhaps the most\r\nremarkable picture in the world.\"\r\n\r\nFor the delicacy of workmanship note especially the mirror, in which\r\nare reflected not only the objects in the room, but others beyond what\r\nappears in the picture, for a door and two additional figures may be\r\ndistinguished. In the frame of the mirror, too, are ten diminutive\r\npictures of the ten \"moments\" in the Passion of Christ \"as material\r\nfor the lady's meditation while doing her hair.\" Notice also the\r\nbrass-work of the chandelier. \"There are many little objects about,\r\nsuch as an orange on the window-sill, placed there to catch the light.\r\nThrough the window you can see a cherry-tree, with sunshine on the\r\nripe fruit. In the treatment of these and similar details Jan van\r\nEyck shows a liking for dots and spots of light\" (Conway). Above the\r\nchandelier, elaborately wrought, is the painter's signature. This\r\nsignature (in Latin), \"Jan van Eyck was here,\" exactly expresses the\r\nmodesty and veracity which were the keynote of his art. The artist only\r\nprofessed to come, to see, and to record what he saw. Arnolfini was the\r\nrepresentative at Bruges of a Lucca firm of merchants, and Van Eyck\r\ngives us a picture of the quiet, dry, business folk exactly as he found\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n187. THE APOTHEOSIS OF WILLIAM THE TACITURN OF HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See 38._\r\n\r\nA sketch of a picture in the possession of the Earl of Jersey. This\r\nsketch was formerly in the possession of Sir David Wilkie, R.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n189. THE DOGE LEONARDO LOREDANO.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_ (Venetian: 1426-1516).\r\n\r\n      Giovanni Bellini (often shortened into Giambellini)--the\r\n      greatest of the fifteenth-century artists--\"the mighty\r\n      Venetian master who alone of all the painters of Italy\r\n      united purity of religious aim with perfection of artistical\r\n      power\"[106]--belonged, it is interesting to note, to a\r\n      thoroughly artistic family. His father, Jacopo, drawings by\r\n      whom may be seen in the British Museum, was an artist of\r\n      repute; his elder brother Gentile (see 1213) was another. The\r\n      two brothers studied together in their father's school at\r\n      Padua, and there they formed a friendship with Mantegna, who\r\n      afterwards married their sister. Two pictures in our Gallery\r\n      (Bellini's, 726; and Mantegna's, 1417) recall the days of\r\n      their early association. By blood every inch an artist, so was\r\n      Giovanni also in character. His life was one long devotion\r\n      to his art. He lived to be ninety, and showed to the end\r\n      increasing knowledge and power. Albert Dürer wrote in 1506,\r\n      when the grand old man was eighty, that \"though very old he was\r\n      still the best painter in Venice.\"[107]\r\n\r\n      This famous portrait must have been painted about the same\r\n      time, for Leonardo Loredano only became Doge in 1501. About\r\n      1460, Bellini had settled in Venice, where he soon rivalled and\r\n      eclipsed the established school of the Vivarini. In 1479, when\r\n      his elder brother Gentile departed to Constantinople, Giovanni\r\n      was appointed in his place to carry on the series of pictures\r\n      for the Hall of the Great Council in the Ducal Palace. These\r\n      works were destroyed by fire in 1577. The documents referring\r\n      to them show the terms on which he worked. He was engaged at\r\n      a fixed rate of salary to work \"constantly and daily, so that\r\n      said pictures may be completed as expeditiously as possible,\r\n      with three assistants, also paid by the State, to render speedy\r\n      and diligent assistance.\" One of these assistants was Carpaccio\r\n      (see 750). Three years later he was appointed State painter to\r\n      the Republic. His fame is sounded by Ariosto, who in \"Orlando\r\n      Furioso\" ranks him with Leonardo. It may be gathered also\r\n      from the number of great painters who attended his studio,\r\n      including Giorgione and Titian. He was overwhelmed with work,\r\n      and doubtless employed assistants to complete commissions from\r\n      his design. Hence the confusion that exists in the matter of\r\n      attribution among pictures of this school (see under 599).\r\n      With Titian he was on terms of warm friendship, and his last\r\n      work (a companion piece to Titian's \"Bacchus and Ariadne,\" now\r\n      in the Duke of Northumberland's Gallery at Alnwick) was left\r\n      for Titian to finish. Bellini was buried in the Church of SS.\r\n      Giovanni e Paolo, in the same tomb where Gentile had lain since\r\n      1507.\r\n\r\n      Giovanni Bellini's long life covers the end of one period\r\n      and the beginning of another in the history of Italian art.\r\n      In point of technique this is so: his earliest works are in\r\n      tempera, his later ones in oil--the use of which medium he\r\n      learnt perhaps from Antonello da Messina. It is so also in\r\n      motive. \"The iridescence of dying statesmanship in Italy, her\r\n      magnificence of hollow piety, were represented in the arts of\r\n      Venice and Florence by two mighty men on either side--Titian\r\n      and Tintoret, Michael Angelo and Raphael. Of the calm and\r\n      brave statesmanship, the modest and faithful religion,\r\n      which had been her strength, I am content to name one chief\r\n      representative artist at Venice, John Bellini.\" The years of\r\n      change were 1480-1520 (roughly speaking those of Raphael's\r\n      life). \"John Bellini precedes the change, meets and resists it\r\n      victoriously till his death. Nothing of flaw or failure is ever\r\n      to be discerned in him\" (_Relation between Michael Angelo and\r\n      Tintoret_, pp. 11-13). His position is thus unique: he was the\r\n      meeting-point of two ways: as great in artistic power as the\r\n      masters who came after, as pure in religious aim as those who\r\n      went before. An interesting episode is recorded which marks\r\n      the transition and Bellini's meeting of it. Isabella Gonzaga,\r\n      the Duchess of Mantua, wrote in 1501 to her agent in Venice to\r\n      get Bellini to do for her a picture of which the subject was\r\n      to be profane, to suit Mantegna's allegories. Bellini suggests\r\n      that he cannot do such a subject in a way to compare with\r\n      Mantegna; with such a subject \"he cannot do anything to look\r\n      well.\" Isabella thereupon is content to put up with a religious\r\n      subject, but Bellini on his side agrees to add \"a distant\r\n      landscape and other fantasies\" (_qualche luntani et altra\r\n      fantaxia_). Bellini, however, was by no means stagnant in his\r\n      art, or in his outlook. At the end of his life, he undertook,\r\n      as we have seen, a Bacchanal, and in his middle period he\r\n      painted the beautiful little allegories now in the Academy at\r\n      Venice. \"Bellini,\" says Morelli, \"was ever making progress. He\r\n      knew how to adapt himself to his subject, and was, as occasion\r\n      required, grand and serious, graceful and attractive, naïve and\r\n      simple.\" It is in Venice that Bellini can be best studied; but\r\n      our National Gallery is fortunate in having more of his works\r\n      than can be seen in any other collection north of the Alps. And\r\n      how varied are his powers! The same hand has given us subjects\r\n      of intense religious conviction, like \"The Agony in the Garden\"\r\n      (726) and \"The Blood of the Redeemer\" (1233); \"sunny pictures\r\n      of devotional sentiment\" (280 and 599); the noble portrait here\r\n      before us; and delicate landscape work, like the \"Peter Martyr\"\r\n      (812). In his earliest pictures he devoted himself to the\r\n      profoundest sentiments of Christianity--perhaps, as has been\r\n      suggested, under the influence of S. Bernardino, then preaching\r\n      at Padua (Roger Fry's _Giovanni Bellini_, p. 22). Afterwards\r\n      the \"note\" in Bellini's work is rather \"genial serenity.\" The\r\n      expression of his Madonnas is often tender and solemn, but\r\n      he never lets it pass into the region of the ecstatic. All\r\n      is bright and peaceful and sunny. He belongs to what Ruskin\r\n      calls \"the age of the masters,\" in which the main object is\r\n      \"pictorial perfectness and deliciousness.\"\r\n\r\nA magnificent portrait of one of the greatest men of the Venetian\r\nRepublic. Leonardo, the 67th Doge, held office from 1501 to 1521. He\r\nbelonged to one of the most ancient and noble families in the State,\r\nand Venice, under his rule, was one of the Great Powers of Europe--as\r\nthe league of Cambrai formed against him sufficiently shows. There\r\nis all the quiet dignity of a born ruler in his face--\"fearless,\r\nfaithful, patient, impenetrable, implacable--every word a fate\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. ix. § 1). In his capacity of\r\nState painter to the Republic it was Bellini's duty to execute the\r\nofficial portraits of the Doges. During his long life he saw no fewer\r\nthan eleven Doges, and was State painter during the reigns of four.\r\nThis, however, is the only portrait of a Doge by Bellini which has been\r\npreserved (Richter's _Lectures on the National Gallery_, p. 42). It is\r\nremarkable alike for strong characterisation, simplicity of conception,\r\nand brilliancy of colouring.\r\n\r\n\r\n190. A JEWISH RABBI.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45, and also under 51.\r\n\r\n\r\n191. THE YOUTHFUL CHRIST AND ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n  _Guido_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1575-1642). _See 11._\r\n\r\nSt. John is charming in the beauty of boyhood. In the youthful Christ\r\nthe painter has striven after something more \"ideal,\" and has produced\r\na somewhat namby-pamby face.\r\n\r\n\r\n192. PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard Dou_ (Dutch: 1613-1675).\r\n\r\n      Dou, who stands at the head of the Leyden School, is\r\n      remarkable for the patient industry which he devoted to his\r\n      work, and which was rewarded by his attainment of wonderful\r\n      mastery in delicate execution. \"Mr. Slap-dash whips out his\r\n      pocket-book, scribbles for five minutes on one page, and\r\n      from that memorandum paints with the aid of the depths of\r\n      his consciousness the whole of his picture. Not so the true\r\n      follower of Gerard Dou. To him the silent surface with the\r\n      white ground is a sacred place that is to tell on after ages,\r\n      and bring pleasure or power or knowledge to hundreds of\r\n      thousands as silently. No eyes, emperor's or clown's, telling\r\n      the other that they have been there. It is worth this man's\r\n      while to spend a whole sketch-book, if need be, over one\r\n      twelve-inch panel\" (_Letters of James Smetham_, p. 173). With\r\n      Gerard Dou \"a picture was a thing of orderly progression,\r\n      even as the flowers of spring gradually unfold their leaves\r\n      and buds and blossoms to the sun. He hurried his work for no\r\n      man, but moved with a princely ease, as much as to say to the\r\n      world, 'Other men may hurry as they please, from necessity or\r\n      excitement; but Gerard Dou at least chooses to think, and to\r\n      perfect his works until he has satisfied himself.'\" At first\r\n      he worked at portrait-painting, but his manner was too slow to\r\n      please his sitters. \"The wife of a wealthy burgomaster paid\r\n      the penalty of possessing a fair white hand by having to sit\r\n      five long days while the painter transferred it to canvas. Had\r\n      his patrons come into the world for no other purpose than to\r\n      serve Gerard Dou, he could not have dissipated their time with\r\n      greater indifference. The cheek of his fair model would grow\r\n      pale with hunger and fatigue while he was rounding a pearl on\r\n      her neck\" (968). Afterwards Dou devoted himself to scenes of\r\n      indoor _genre_, and herein \"he spent as much time in imitating\r\n      an indentation on a copper stewpan as he devoted to a dimple\r\n      in the refulgent cheek of beauty. Each object he transcribes\r\n      is sharp or dull, transparent or opaque, rounded or squared,\r\n      as it ought to be. The texture is always given with exactness,\r\n      even to the minute threads in a costly robe. He paints goblets\r\n      of wine which would tempt an ascetic. His gentlemen smoke\r\n      such delicately moulded clay pipes with so much serenity that\r\n      smoking in his pictures is invested with all the grace of an\r\n      accomplishment. He carried his neatness and love of order into\r\n      his studio. Other painters were content to sit at an easel of\r\n      plain deal--Gerard Dou must have one of ebony, inlaid with\r\n      mother-of-pearl. He locked up his colours in a costly cabinet\r\n      as if they had been rubies, emeralds, and brilliants of the\r\n      first water. On arriving in front of his easel, he is said\r\n      to have paused for a few moments to allow the dust to settle\r\n      before he uncovered the picture\" (Merritt's _Art Criticism and\r\n      Romance_, i. 170). The German painter Sandrart relates that he\r\n      once visited Dou's studio and admired the great care bestowed\r\n      by the artist on the painting of a broomstick. Dou remarked\r\n      that he would still have to work at it for three days more. The\r\n      history of his pictures is a remarkable instance of industry\r\n      rewarded. In his lifetime an amateur of the name of Spiering\r\n      used to pay him one thousand florins a year--in itself a good\r\n      income--for the mere privilege of having the first offer of\r\n      his pictures; and since his death their value has steadily\r\n      increased. Of his life, beyond what has been stated above,\r\n      little is known. He was the son of a glazier at Leyden, and was\r\n      apprenticed successively to an engraver and a glass-painter.\r\n      At the age of fifteen he entered the studio of Rembrandt, with\r\n      whom he remained three years. He lived nearly all his life in\r\n      his native town. Among his pupils were Schalcken (199), Mieris\r\n      (840), and Metsu (838).\r\n\r\nThis fine portrait is painted (says Sir Edward Poynter) in a style\r\nunusually large and free for the master.\r\n\r\n\r\n193. LOT AND HIS DAUGHTERS LEAVING SODOM.\r\n\r\n  _Guido_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1575-1642). _See 11._\r\n\r\nThis and the companion picture (196) are interesting as being two of\r\nthe nation's conspicuously bad bargains. The purchase of them at very\r\nhigh prices, £1680 and £1260, was indeed one of the grievances that\r\nled to the Select Committee of the House of Commons, 1853, and to the\r\nsubsequent reconstitution of the Gallery. \"Expert\" witnesses declared\r\nbefore the Committee that these two pictures ought not to have been\r\nbought at any price or even accepted as a gift. Ruskin had some time\r\npreviously written to the _Times_ about them as follows:--\r\n\r\n      \"Sir, if the canvases of Guido, lately introduced into the\r\n      Gallery, had been good works of even that bad master, which\r\n      they are not,--if they had been genuine and untouched works,\r\n      even though feeble, which they are not,--if, though false and\r\n      retouched remnants of a feeble and fallen school, they had been\r\n      endurably decent or elementarily instructive,--some conceivable\r\n      excuse might perhaps have been by ingenuity forged, and by\r\n      impudence uttered, for their introduction into a gallery where\r\n      we previously possessed two good Guidos (11 and 177) ... but\r\n      now, sir, what vestige of an apology remains for the cumbering\r\n      our walls with pictures that have no single virtue, no colour,\r\n      no drawing, no character, no history, no thought?\" (_Arrows of\r\n      the Chace_, i. 64, 65).\r\n\r\n\r\n194. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See 38._\r\n\r\nAt the wedding of Thetis and Peleus an apple was thrown amongst the\r\nguests by the Goddess of Discord, to be given to the most beautiful.\r\nParis, the Trojan shepherd, was ordered by Jupiter to decide the\r\ncontest. He is here seated with Mercury, the messenger of the gods,\r\nat his side, about to award the apple to Venus. On the right of Venus\r\nis Juno with her peacock at her feet; on the left, Minerva, with her\r\nowl perched behind her. Paris thus chose Pleasure, instead of Power or\r\nWisdom; and from his choice came, the story adds, all the troubling\r\nof domestic peace involved in the Trojan War. The Goddess of Discord,\r\nalready assured of her victory and its consequences, hovers in the\r\nclouds above, spreading fire and pestilence.\r\n\r\nThis picture--one of Rubens's masterpieces and \"evidently entirely\r\nthe work of his own hand\"--belongs to his latest period; \"never did\r\nhe show his intense appreciation of the beauty of flesh and the\r\ndelights of colour more conspicuously than in the pictures of his old\r\nage.\" Characteristic also is the painter's treatment of the subject.\r\nThe goddesses are as substantial as any figures of flesh and blood;\r\nthe picture is realistic, not symbolic. An exactly opposite method\r\nof treatment was exemplified in Mr. Watt's \"Judgment of Paris,\"\r\nexhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1887. Paris was left out, for\r\ndoes not every lover have the same choice to make for himself? and the\r\ngoddesses were soft visionary forms of purely ideal beauty (_cf. Modern\r\nPainters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. viii. § 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n195. A MEDICAL PROFESSOR.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (German School).\r\n\r\nThe interest of this picture lies in the history of its purchase. It\r\nwas bought by the trustees in 1845, on the advice of the then Keeper,\r\nas a Holbein. \"The veriest tyro might well have been ashamed of such\r\na purchase\" (_Arrows of the Chace_, i. 65); and very much ashamed\r\nthe trustees were, when immediately after the purchase the hoax was\r\ndiscovered. There and then they subscribed £100 between them, which\r\nthey offered to M. Rochard, the dealer, \"to induce him to annul the\r\nbargain, but he declined, and there was an end of it.\"[108]\r\n\r\n\r\n196. SUSANNAH AND THE ELDERS.\r\n\r\n  _Guido Reni_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1575-1642). _See 11._\r\n\r\n\"A work devoid alike of art and decency\" (_Modern Painters_, vol.\r\nii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. xiv. § 24). For the circumstances of its\r\nacquisition see above under 193.\r\n\r\n\r\n197. A WILD BOAR HUNT.\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish: 1599-1660).\r\n\r\n      Don Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velazquez was born at Seville of\r\n      well-to-do parents--his father's name being Silva, his mother's\r\n      Velazquez. His talent for drawing quickly showed itself, and\r\n      when only twenty he married Juana, the daughter of his second\r\n      master, Pacheco (his first being another painter of Seville,\r\n      Herrera). Pacheco's house, says one of the Spanish historians,\r\n      was \"the golden prison of painting,\" and it was here that\r\n      Velazquez met Cervantes, and obtained his first introduction\r\n      to the brilliant circle in which he was himself to shine. In\r\n      Pacheco's company he went in 1622 to Madrid, where he had\r\n      influential friends, and next year he was invited to return\r\n      by Olivares, the king's great minister. Olivares persuaded\r\n      the king to sit to Velazquez for his portrait. The portrait\r\n      was a complete success, and the painter stepped at once into\r\n      fame and favour. This immediate success is characteristic of\r\n      his extraordinary facility. \"Just think,\" says Ruskin, \"what\r\n      is implied when a man of the enormous power and facility that\r\n      Reynolds had, says he was 'trying to do with great labour'\r\n      what Velazquez 'did at once.'\" Velazquez shows indeed \"the\r\n      highest reach of technical perfection yet attained in art; all\r\n      effort and labour seeming to cease in the radiant peace and\r\n      simplicity of consummate human power\"[109] (_Two Paths_, § 68;\r\n      _Fors Clavigera_, 1876, p. 188). From the time of this first\r\n      portrait of Philip IV. onwards, the life of Velazquez was one\r\n      long triumph. He was not only the favourite but the friend of\r\n      the king. He was made in succession painter to the king, keeper\r\n      of the wardrobe, usher of the royal chamber, and chamberlain,\r\n      and offices were also found for his friends and relations.\r\n      He lived in the king's palace on terms of close intimacy,\r\n      painting the king and his family in innumerable attitudes, and\r\n      accompanying him on his royal progresses. When our Charles I.,\r\n      then Prince of Wales, visited Madrid in 1623, Velazquez painted\r\n      his portrait, and figured in all the royal fêtes held in the\r\n      English prince's honour. The Duke of Buckingham, it would seem,\r\n      was also his friend, and Velazquez saw much too of Rubens, when\r\n      the latter came on his diplomatic mission to Madrid. Rubens\r\n      advised Velazquez to visit Italy, and in 1630 the king gave\r\n      his consent. He travelled with recommendations from the king,\r\n      and wherever he went--Venice, Ferrara, Rome, Naples--he was\r\n      received with all the honours accorded to princes. His second\r\n      visit to Italy was in 1648, when the king sent him to buy\r\n      pictures with the view of forming a Spanish Academy. At Rome he\r\n      painted the portrait of the Pope (Innocent X.), which made so\r\n      great a mark that it was carried in triumphal procession, like\r\n      Cimabue's picture of old. His royal master, however, became\r\n      impatient for his return, and he hurried back to Madrid, after\r\n      giving commissions to all the leading artists then at Rome. On\r\n      his return he was given fresh honours and offices--especially\r\n      that of Marshal of the Court, whose duty it was to superintend\r\n      the personal lodgment of the king during excursions. It was\r\n      the duties of this office which were the immediate cause\r\n      of his death. He accompanied the king to the conference at\r\n      Irun--on the \"Island of the Pheasants\"--which led to the\r\n      marriage of Louis XIV. with the Infanta Maria Teresa. There is\r\n      a picture of him at Versailles by the French artist Lebrun,\r\n      which was painted on this occasion. The portrait, sombre\r\n      and cadaverous-looking, was no doubt true to life; and when\r\n      Velazquez returned to Madrid, it was found that his exertions\r\n      in arranging the royal journey had sown the seeds of a fever,\r\n      from which after a week's illness he died. Seven days later his\r\n      wife died of grief, and was buried at his side.\r\n\r\n      Though Velazquez spent all his life, as we have seen, amongst\r\n      the great ones of the earth, no trace of vanity or meanness\r\n      is discernible in his character. Ruskin (_The Two Paths_,\r\n      §§ 62, 65) connects his sweetness of disposition with the\r\n      truthfulness which was characteristic of his art. \"The art\r\n      which is especially dedicated to natural fact always indicates\r\n      a peculiar gentleness and tenderness of mind, and all great and\r\n      successful work of that kind will assuredly be the production\r\n      of thoughtful, sensitive, earnest, kind men, large in their\r\n      views of life, and full of various intellectual power ... (One\r\n      instance is Reynolds). The other painter whom I would give\r\n      you as an instance of this gentleness is a man of another\r\n      nation, on the whole I suppose one of the most cruel civilised\r\n      nations in the world,--the Spaniards. They produced but one\r\n      great painter, only one; but he among the very greatest of\r\n      painters, Velazquez. You would not suppose, from looking at\r\n      Velazquez's portraits generally, that he was an especially kind\r\n      or good man; you perceive a peculiar sternness about them;\r\n      for they were as true as steel, and the persons whom he had\r\n      to paint being not generally kind or good people, they were\r\n      stern in expression, and Velazquez gave the sternness; but he\r\n      had precisely the same intense perception of truth, the same\r\n      marvellous instinct for the rendering of all natural soul and\r\n      all natural form that our Reynolds had. Let me, then, read you\r\n      his character as it is given by Mr. Stirling (afterwards Sir\r\n      W. Stirling-Maxwell): 'Certain charges, of what nature we are\r\n      not informed, brought against him after his death, made it\r\n      necessary for his executor to refute them at a private audience\r\n      granted to him by the king for that purpose. After listening\r\n      to the defence of his friend, Philip immediately made answer,\r\n      \"I can believe all you say of the excellent disposition of\r\n      Diego Velazquez.\" Having lived for half his life in courts, he\r\n      was yet capable both of gratitude and generosity.... No mean\r\n      jealousy ever influenced his conduct to his brother artists; he\r\n      could afford not only to acknowledge the merits, but to forgive\r\n      the malice of his rivals. His character was of that rare and\r\n      happy kind, in which high intellectual power is combined\r\n      with indomitable strength of will, and a winning sweetness\r\n      of temper.'\" Nothing shows his character better than his\r\n      treatment of Murillo, who came to Madrid, an unfriended youth,\r\n      in 1640. Velazquez received him to his house, gave directions\r\n      for his admission to all the galleries and for permission to\r\n      copy, presented him to the king, procured him commissions, and\r\n      offered him facilities for making the journey to Rome.\r\n\r\n      The chief characteristics of Velazquez's art have been already\r\n      incidentally alluded to. \"Rejecting all influences,\" says Sir\r\n      Frederick Burton, \"alike native and foreign, and following\r\n      nature alone, he succeeded in imitating the true appearances\r\n      of things as seen through the atmosphere that surrounds them,\r\n      with a fidelity that has never been matched. Whatever he\r\n      undertook to paint, whether the human face and figure, other\r\n      animals, or landscape scenery, the result in his hands was a\r\n      presentment intensely individualised, and yet, at the same\r\n      time, suggestive of the type.\" Some modern writers claim the\r\n      work of Velazquez as \"impressionism\"--a much abused and a\r\n      very ill-defined term. Certainly Velazquez, like every other\r\n      great artist, painted his impressions. But his sheet-anchor\r\n      was fidelity to fact; and as for his _technique_, it was\r\n      only by constant observation and practice that he attained\r\n      that lightness of hand, that felicity of touch, by which his\r\n      later work is characterised. For a painting of the master's\r\n      earliest period, see 1375. The truthfulness of Velazquez had\r\n      its reward, says Ruskin, in making him distinguished also\r\n      amongst all Spanish painters by the sparkling purity of his\r\n      colour. \"Colour is, more than all elements of art, the reward\r\n      of veracity of purpose.... In giving an account of anything\r\n      for its own sake, the most important points are those of form.\r\n      Nevertheless, the form of the object is its own attribute;\r\n      special, not shared with other things. An error in giving an\r\n      account of it does not necessarily involve wider error. But\r\n      its colour is partly its own, partly shared with other things\r\n      round it. The hue and power of all broad sunlight is involved\r\n      in the colour it has cast upon this single thing; to falsify\r\n      that colour, is to misrepresent and break the harmony of the\r\n      day: also, by what colour it bears, this single object is\r\n      altering hues all round it; reflecting its own into them,\r\n      displaying them by opposition, softening them by repetition;\r\n      one falsehood in colour in one place, implies a thousand in\r\n      the neighbourhood.... Hence the apparent anomaly that the only\r\n      schools of colour are the schools of Realism.... Velazquez,\r\n      the greatest colourist, is the most accurate portrait painter\r\n      of Spain\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. xi. § 8\r\n      _n._).[110] It is curious that the influence of Velazquez was\r\n      in his own time and country comparatively circumscribed. He\r\n      exercised no such overpowering attraction as that of Leonardo,\r\n      or Raphael, or Michael Angelo. The real followers of Velazquez\r\n      are painters of our own day, and more especially the French\r\n      painters of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and\r\n      their imitators in the other schools of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nA very interesting picture, both for the sparkling brilliancy of its\r\nexecution and for the truth with which it reproduces the court life\r\nof the time. Philip IV. was as fond of the chase as he was of the\r\narts; and here we see some state hunting-party in a royal enclosure\r\n(such as was arranged, no doubt, for the pleasure of our Charles I.\r\nwhen he visited Madrid), with an array of huntsmen and guards, and\r\nmagnificent carriages for the ladies of the court. \"The king has just\r\nthrown his _horquilla_ [a kind of pitchfork] into the flank of a boar\r\ntearing furiously by.... Here the heroes of the day are very slightly\r\nsketched, but we at once recognise Philip IV. from the few touches\r\nsuggesting his face; he keeps to the right, owing to the proximity\r\nof the ladies, and by him stands Olivares as equerry-in-chief.... In\r\nthe second carriage is Queen Isabella. Occasionally the boars made\r\ntremendous leaps; hence the ladies are also provided with pitchforks\r\nto turn them aside. Moreover, two huntsmen with spears keep watch by\r\nthe Queen's coach. The groups of spectators deserve minute study.\r\nThey contain studies of costume and character enough for a scrap-book\r\nof \"Castilian Types of the Seventeenth Century.\" Thus, notice under\r\nthe tree on the right a peasant resting with elbows and chest on\r\nthe patient back of his beloved ass--verily, another Sancho Panza!\r\nAnd those two rogues on the grass, one holding the water-jug to his\r\nmouth, look like a sketch by Murillo. The mendicant, again, in the\r\nbrown cloak, both hands resting on his stick, is surely a privileged\r\nspeculator, who solemnly invites the rich folk to increase their stock\r\nin the next world by entrusting their investments to him. Elsewhere is\r\na rider slashing at the hard flanks of his obstinate mule, while his\r\n_escudero_ shoves from behind; two cavaliers paying each other formal\r\ncompliments; a group of experts in \"dog-flesh\" near the master of the\r\nhounds, thronging round the fine boar-hound, who has been ripped up by\r\nthe quarry. Notice, too, the isolated group of cavaliers in grey and\r\nscarlet cloaks, with the clergyman, perhaps the \"chaplain to the hunt.\"\r\nThey stand apart from the scene, having more weighty matters on hand.\"\r\n\"The figures do not seem very numerous, as they are scattered about\r\nwithout a trace of conventional grouping. Yet, even without the heads\r\nthat are merely suggested, there are over a hundred figures, some sixty\r\noutside and fifty inside the central enclosure. Sir Edwin Landseer\r\ndeclared that he had never seen so much large art on so small a scale\"\r\n(Justi's _Velazquez and his Times_, pp. 212-14). Notice especially the\r\ntwo splendid dogs near the left-hand corner. Velazquez is very great in\r\npainting dogs; he \"has made some of them nearly as grand as his surly\r\nkings\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. § 13).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the execution of the picture (which was bought in 1846\r\nand was alleged to have been damaged in cleaning), Ruskin wrote:\r\n\"I have seldom met with an example of the master which gave me\r\nmore delight, or which I believed to be in more genuine or perfect\r\ncondition.... (The critic's) complaint of loss of substance in the\r\nfigures of the foreground is, I have no doubt, altogether groundless.\r\nHe has seen little southern scenery if he supposes that the brilliancy\r\nand apparent nearness of the silver clouds is in the slightest degree\r\novercharged; and shows little appreciation of Velazquez in supposing\r\nhim to have sacrificed the solemnity and might of such a distance\r\nto the inferior interest of the figures in the foreground.... The\r\nposition of the horizon suggests, and the _lateral_ extent of the\r\nforeground _proves_, such a distance between the spectator and even\r\nits nearest figures as may well justify the slightness of their\r\nexecution. Even granting that some of the upper glazings of the figures\r\nhad been removed, the tone of the whole picture is so light, grey,\r\nand glittering, and the dependence on the power of its whites so\r\nabsolute, that I think the process hardly to be regretted which has\r\nleft these in lustre so precious, and restored to a brilliancy which a\r\ncomparison with any modern work of similar aim would render apparently\r\nsupernatural, the sparkling motion of its figures and the serene snow\r\nof its sky\"[111] (_Arrows of the Chace_, i. 58-60).\r\n\r\n\r\n198. THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n  _Annibale Carracci_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1560-1609). _See 9._\r\n\r\nThe legend of the temptation of St. Anthony, here realistically set\r\nforth, is the story of the temptations that beset the ascetic. In\r\nthe wilderness, brooding over sin, he is tempted; it is only when he\r\nreturns to the world and goes about doing good that the temptations\r\ncease to trouble him. St. Anthony lived, like Faust, the life of\r\na recluse and a visionary, and like him was tempted of the devil.\r\n\"Seeing that wicked suggestions availed not, Satan raised up in his\r\nsight (again like Mephistopheles in _Faust_) the sensible images of\r\nforbidden things. He clothed his demons in human forms; they hovered\r\nround him in the shape of beautiful women, who, with the softest\r\nblandishments, allured him to sin.\" The saint in his distress resolved\r\nto flee yet farther from the world; but it is not so that evil can\r\nbe conquered, and still \"spirits in hideous forms pressed round him\r\nin crowds, scourged him and tore him with their talons--all shapes\r\nof horror, 'worse than fancy ever feigned or fear conceived,' came\r\nroaring, howling, hissing, shrieking in his ears.\" In the midst of all\r\nthis terror a vision of help from on high shone upon him; the evil\r\nphantoms vanished, and he arose unhurt and strong to endure. But it is\r\ncharacteristic of the love of horror in the Bolognese School that in\r\nCarracci's picture the celestial vision does not dissolve the terrors.\r\n\r\n\r\n199. LESBIA AND HER SPARROW.\r\n\r\n  _Godfried Schalcken_ (Dutch: 1643-1706).\r\n\r\n      Schalcken was probably a pupil of Gerard Dou (see 192), whose\r\n      delicate finish he sought to rival. \"But the smooth, polished\r\n      surface of his works is unpleasant, and the labour bestowed\r\n      upon them is too obvious\" (Burton). He spent the greater part\r\n      of his life at Dort, but he was employed for some time in\r\n      England by King William III. In addition to his _genre_ pieces,\r\n      Schalcken painted numerous portraits, and also attempted sacred\r\n      subjects. He especially excelled in pictures of candle-light.\r\n\r\nA picture in illustration of a Latin poem, as befits a painter whose\r\nfather was headmaster of a Latin school (at Dort). Lesbia is weighing\r\njewels against her sparrow, which she loved better even than her own\r\neyes--\r\n\r\n    Mourn, every Venus, every Love!\r\n      Gallants gay, mourn every one!\r\n    My darling had a favourite dove,\r\n      That she did prize\r\n      As her own eyes--\r\n    Her dove is dead and gone.\r\n\r\n  G. R., from _Catullus_, iii.\r\n\r\n\r\n200. THE MADONNA IN PRAYER.\r\n\r\n  _Sassoferrato_ (Eclectic: 1605-1685).\r\n\r\n      Giovanni Battista Salvi, called Sassoferrato from his\r\n      birthplace, not far from Urbino, is generally described as a\r\n      follower of the Carracci, but he seems to have been chiefly\r\n      a copyist of Raphael, Perugino, and other early masters.\r\n      Compare Sassoferrato's Madonnas with the earlier models, and\r\n      the distinction between sentimentality and sentiment becomes\r\n      plain. His works are, however, marked by real feeling, and he\r\n      maintained a certain elevation of style.\r\n\r\n\r\n202. DOMESTIC POULTRY\r\n\r\n  _Melchior de Hondecoeter_ (Dutch: 1636-1695).\r\n\r\n      This painter, a member of a noble family of Brabant, devoted\r\n      himself to the poultry-yard, and became famous for his pictures\r\n      of fowl and other birds. His compositions show a constant study\r\n      of the subjects he treats. He studied first under his father,\r\n      Gysbert de Hondecoeter, and afterwards under his uncle, Jan\r\n      Baptist Weenix (1096).\r\n\r\n\"A beautiful brood of young chickens in the foreground. The cock was\r\nHondecoeter's favourite bird, which he is said to have taught to stand\r\nto him in a fixed position as a model.\" (Official Catalogue).\r\n\r\n\r\n203. CONVENTUAL CHARITY.\r\n\r\n  _William van Herp_ (Flemish: 1614-1677).\r\n\r\n      Works by W. Van Herp, a member of the Painters' Guild at\r\n      Antwerp, are not numerous. They show the influence of Rubens\r\n      and also of Jordaens, the two leaders of the Flemish School at\r\n      his time.\r\n\r\nFranciscan friars are distributing food to the poor at the gate of a\r\nconvent.\r\n\r\n\r\n204. DUTCH SHIPPING.\r\n\r\n  _Bakhuizen_ (Dutch: 1631-1708).\r\n\r\n      Ludolf Bakhuizen comes second in the succession of Dutch\r\n      sea painters to W. van de Velde, and the reader is referred\r\n      to the remarks on that painter (see under 149) for the\r\n      general characteristics of them both. Whereas, however, Van\r\n      de Velde preferred calms, Bakhuizen preferred storms, and\r\n      even \"voluntarily exposed his life several times,\" says a\r\n      compatriot, \"for the sake of seizing, in all its horrible\r\n      reality, the effects of rough weather\" (Havard: _The Dutch\r\n      School_, p. 255). It cannot be said, however, that the result\r\n      was very successful. There is, adds the same critic, a hardness\r\n      about his forms and a want of transparency in his colours\r\n      \"which cannot be counterbalanced by the fury of upheaved\r\n      waves or the furious driving of the heavy clouds across the\r\n      sky.\" Bakhuizen, before he took to painting, was successively\r\n      a book-keeper (his father was town-clerk of Emden) and a\r\n      writing-master. Perhaps it is to his experience in the latter\r\n      capacity that the hardness and \"peruke-like\" regularity of\r\n      his waves are due. In his own day, however, his sea-pieces\r\n      were very greatly esteemed. The King of Prussia was among his\r\n      patrons, and the Tzar, Peter the Great, frequently visited his\r\n      studios, and even himself took lessons of him. He made many\r\n      constructive drawings of ships for that monarch. He was also\r\n      an etcher, and the British Museum possesses a fragment of a\r\n      sketch-book of his.\r\n\r\n\r\n205. ITINERANT MUSICIANS.\r\n\r\n  _J. W. E. Dietrich_ (German: 1712-1774).\r\n\r\n      Johann Wilhelm Ernst Dietrich was born at Weimar, where his\r\n      father was court-painter. So precocious was his talent that\r\n      when only in his eighteenth year he was himself appointed\r\n      court-painter to Augustus II., King of Poland and Elector of\r\n      Saxony. In 1743 he went to Italy, and after this visit he\r\n      turned his name into Italian by signing it Dietrici (as in the\r\n      picture dated 1745). He was afterwards appointed keeper of the\r\n      celebrated Gallery at Dresden, a Professor of the Academy\r\n      there, and Director of the school of painting attached to the\r\n      porcelain manufactory. His pictures and etchings are numerous.\r\n      In his original work his style remained German. But he had also\r\n      a remarkable facility in imitating the works of other painters.\r\n      \"He did more,\" says Merritt, the picture-restorer, \"to confound\r\n      collectors than all other imitators put together. Hundreds\r\n      of his imitations of the various masters have been sold to\r\n      second-rate amateurs for original productions\" (_Art Criticism\r\n      and Romance_, i. 164).\r\n\r\n\r\n206. THE HEAD OF A GIRL.\r\n\r\n  _Jean Baptiste Greuze_ (French: 1725-1805).\r\n\r\n      To understand the great reputation which Greuze enjoyed in his\r\n      day one should remember, besides the prettiness of his pictures\r\n      in themselves, the contrast which they afforded in their\r\n      subject-matter to the art around them. Look, for instance,\r\n      at 1090 and 101-104. Those pictures are nearly contemporary\r\n      with Greuze's, and are typical, the first of the mythology,\r\n      the latter of the courtliness, and all of the sensuality, of\r\n      the current art of the time. The return to nature, the return\r\n      to simpler life and sounder morals, which inspired Rousseau,\r\n      found expression in Greuze's domestic scenes and sweet girl\r\n      faces. \"Courage, my good Greuze,\" said Diderot of one of\r\n      Greuze's pictures of domestic drama; \"introduce morality into\r\n      painting. What, has not the pencil been long enough and too\r\n      long consecrated to debauchery and vice? Ought we not to be\r\n      delighted at seeing it at last unite with dramatic poetry in\r\n      instructing us, correcting us, inviting us to virtue?\"[112]\r\n      Greuze's art, in comparison with what was around it, was thus\r\n      simple, natural, moral. Yet one sees now that something of\r\n      the artificiality, against which his pictures were a protest,\r\n      nevertheless affected them. For instance there is an obvious\r\n      posing in this picture, just as there is a touch of affectation\r\n      in 1154. Decidedly, too, Greuze \"invests his lessons of\r\n      bourgeois morality with sensuous attractions.\" There is neither\r\n      the innocence nor the unconsciousness in the girls of Greuze\r\n      that there is in those of Reynolds or Millais.\r\n\r\n      The life of Greuze is interesting for the curious instance it\r\n      affords of the inability, which so many eminent men have shown,\r\n      to know in what direction their best powers lay. Greuze's\r\n      reputation rested on his _genre_ painting--on his rendering of\r\n      domestic scenes or faces; but his ambition was to figure as\r\n      an historical painter. His one picture in this style--\"Severus\r\n      and Caracalla\" (in the Louvre)--was painted in 1769 as his\r\n      diploma work for the French Academy. They praised him for\r\n      \"his former productions, which were excellent,\" and not for\r\n      \"this one, which was unworthy alike of them and of him,\" and\r\n      admitted him as a painter in the class of _genre_ only. Greuze,\r\n      who was vain and overbearing in the days of his vogue, was\r\n      greatly incensed and ceased to exhibit at the Academy until\r\n      after the Revolution. But his power had then begun to fail;\r\n      the classic school reigned supreme; and Greuze, who had been\r\n      unhappily married, and whose large earnings were squandered by\r\n      extravagance and bad management, died in great poverty. He was\r\n      born in Burgundy, of humble middle-class parents, in the little\r\n      town of Tournus, where his modest birthplace may still be seen.\r\n      His happiest productions were taken from the daily life of the\r\n      middle-classes, and his sweet girl faces are unique in French\r\n      art (Lady Dilke's article in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, and\r\n      Morley's _Diderot_, vol. ii. chap. iii.).\r\n\r\nCampbell's \"Lines on a picture of a girl by Greuze\" may be quoted of\r\nthis picture:--\r\n\r\n    What wert thou, maid?--thy life--thy name\r\n      Oblivion hides in mystery;\r\n    Though from thy face my heart could frame\r\n      A long romantic history.\r\n\r\n    Transported to thy time I seem,\r\n      Though dust thy coffin covers--\r\n    And hear the songs, in fancy's dream,\r\n      Of thy devoted lovers.\r\n\r\n    How witching must have been thy breath--\r\n      How sweet the living charmer--\r\n    Whose every semblance after death\r\n      Can make the heart grow warmer!\r\n\r\n\r\n207. THE IDLE SERVANT.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Maes_ (Dutch: 1632-1693). _See_ 153.\r\n\r\nIn the background is the family at dinner. The waiting-maid comes to\r\nthe kitchen to serve the next course--the duckling, perhaps, which\r\na cat is stealing--and finds the cook of Sancho Panza's philosophy:\r\n\"Blessings on him who invented sleep, ... the food that appeases\r\nhunger, the drink that quenches thirst, ... the balance that equals the\r\nsimple with the wise.\" Signed and dated 1655.\r\n\r\n\r\n208. THE FINDING OF MOSES.\r\n\r\n  _Bartholomew Breenbergh_ (Dutch: 1599-1659).\r\n\r\n      Breenbergh, after visiting Italy, established himself in\r\n      France, where, after the example of Poussin and Claude, he\r\n      painted \"classical landscapes,\" into which he introduced small\r\n      figures, supposed to represent scenes from Holy Writ, etc.\r\n      His work was in great request in France, and several of his\r\n      pictures are now in the Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n209. THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.\r\n\r\n  _Both_ and _Poelenburgh_ (Dutch). _See under_ 71 and 955.\r\n\r\nThe landscape by Both, the figures by Poelenburgh. For the subject of\r\nthe judgment of Paris, see under 194.\r\n\r\n\r\n210. VENICE: THE PIAZZA DI SAN MARCO.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Guardi_ (Venetian: 1712-1793).\r\n\r\n      Francesco Guardi was a scholar and imitator of Canaletto. \"Less\r\n      prized during the heyday of his master's fame, he has been\r\n      steadily acquiring reputation on account of certain qualities\r\n      peculiar to himself. His draughtsmanship displays an agreeable\r\n      stateliness; his colouring a graceful gemmy brightness and\r\n      a glow of sunny gold. But what has mainly served to win for\r\n      Guardi popularity, is the attention he paid to contemporary\r\n      costume and manners. Canaletto filled large canvases with\r\n      mathematical perspectives of city and water. At the same time\r\n      he omitted life and incident. There is little to remind us that\r\n      the Venice he so laboriously depicted was the Venice of perukes\r\n      and bagwigs, of masks and hoops and carnival disguises. Guardi\r\n      had an eye for local colour and for fashionable humours\" (J. A.\r\n      Symonds, \"Pietro Longhi,\" in the _Century Guild Hobby Horse_,\r\n      April 1889).\r\n\r\nNotice the effect of light on the Church of St. Mark at the end of the\r\nsquare: \"Beyond those troops of ordered arches there rises a vision out\r\nof the earth, and all the great square seems to have opened from it in\r\na kind of awe, that we may see it far away;--a multitude of pillars\r\nand white domes, clustered into a long low pyramid of coloured light\"\r\n(_Stones of Venice_, vol. ii. ch. iv. § 14).\r\n\r\n\r\n211. A BATTLE-PIECE.\r\n\r\n  _Johan van Huchtenburgh_ (Dutch: 1646-1733).\r\n\r\n      Huchtenburgh was in great request as a battle-painter, and in\r\n      1708 was commissioned by Prince Eugene to paint the victories\r\n      won by that prince and the Duke of Marlborough over the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n212. A MERCHANT AND HIS CLERK.\r\n\r\n  _Thomas de Keyser_ (Dutch: 1596-1667).\r\n\r\n      This painter--the son of an eminent sculptor and architect--was\r\n      born at Amsterdam, and was one of the chief forerunners of\r\n      Rembrandt in the art of portrait painting. \"If,\" says Burton,\r\n      \"in some of his work remains of the formality and stiffness\r\n      of the sixteenth century may be traced, the greater number\r\n      show a freedom and a sense of life unusual among those of his\r\n      predecessors.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture--which is signed (on the mantelpiece) and dated 1627--is\r\ninteresting as showing us, in a particular instance, the condition of\r\nsocial and political life out of which the Dutch art of the seventeenth\r\ncentury arose. The merchant has his globes before him: he was one of\r\nthose who had built up the riches of his country by foreign trade. But\r\nhe is a man of taste as well as of business, and the two things are\r\nclosely united.[113] His office is itself hung with rich tapestry, and\r\namongst the implements of his trade, his plans and books and maps, is\r\na guitar. \"The United Provinces, grouped together by the Convention\r\nof Utrecht (1579), ... concentrated the public functions in the hands\r\nof an aristocratic middle class (such as we see them in Terburg's\r\nhistorical picture, 896), educated and powerful, eager for science and\r\nriches, bold enough to undertake everything, and persevering enough\r\nto carry their enterprises to a successful conclusion. The brilliant\r\nheroism, implacable will, and indefatigable perseverance which had\r\naided the people to recover their liberty and autonomy were now\r\ndirected to other objects.... Their shipbuilders covered the seas with\r\nvessels, a legion of adventurous sailors went forth in all directions\r\nto discover distant shores or to conquer unknown continents.... Gold\r\nwas now to be found in plenty in the country which hitherto had been\r\npoor, and with the influx of riches, taste, luxury, appreciation of the\r\nbeautiful and love of Art were developed\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_,\r\np. 62).\r\n\r\n\r\n213. THE VISION OF A KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n  _Raphael_ (Urbino: 1483-1520). _See_ 1171.\r\n\r\n      This picture--with the original pen-and-ink drawing from which\r\n      it was traced[114]--is the earliest known work of Raphael,\r\n      painted when he was not more than seventeen and was \"pluming\r\n      his wings and meditating a flight.\" His first (or as it is\r\n      commonly called, \"Perugian\") period may be divided into two:\r\n      (1) Down to about 1500, before he went to Perugia, and whilst\r\n      he was still studying at Urbino under Timoteo Viti; (2) From\r\n      1500-1504, at Perugia. This picture probably belongs to the\r\n      former of these periods. It is unlike Perugino in several\r\n      respects--in the landscape, for instance, and in the broad hand\r\n      of the sleeping knight, whereas Perugino's hands are narrower\r\n      and longer. In connection, too, with Raphael's early pupilage\r\n      under a Ferrarese master, note that the figure of Duty is\r\n      like Francia's saint in No. 638 (see further on this subject\r\n      Morelli's _Italian Pictures in German Galleries_, pp. 285-340).\r\n      The picture, which was at one time in the possession of Sir\r\n      Thomas Lawrence, came to England from the Borghese Gallery at\r\n      Rome. It was originally in the Ducal Palace at Urbino. \"The\r\n      subject breathes the very essence of that courtly and romantic\r\n      atmosphere which haunted the palace of Urbino and may well\r\n      have been inspired by the Duchess Elizabeth herself. This\r\n      accomplished lady was the first to honour the son of her old\r\n      friend Giovanni Santi with her patronage, and Raphael may have\r\n      painted this little allegory for the decoration of her chamber,\r\n      just as Costa and Mantegna painted their picture of Parnassus\r\n      and the Muses for Isabella d'Este's grotto at Mantua\" (Julia\r\n      Cartwright: _Early Work of Raphael_, p. 12).\r\n\r\nA young knight sleeps under a laurel--the tree whose leaves were in all\r\nages the reward of honour; and in a dream of his future career he sees\r\ntwo figures approach him, between whom he has to make his choice. The\r\none on the left speaks with the voice of Duty; she is purple-robed and\r\noffers him a book and a sword--emblematic of the active life of study\r\nand conflict. The other is of fair countenance and is gaily decked\r\nwith ribbons and strings of coral. Hers is the voice of Pleasure, and\r\nthe flower she offers is a sprig of myrtle in bloom--\"myrtle dear to\r\nVenus.\" Raphael was thinking, perhaps, of the Greek story which told\r\nof the choice of Hercules. For Hercules, when he came to man's estate,\r\nlaid him down to rest and pondered which road in life to take; and\r\nlo! there stood by him two women. And one of them took up her parable\r\nand said: \"O Hercules, if thou wouldst choose the smoothest and the\r\npleasantest path, then shouldst thou follow me.\" And Hercules said:\r\n\"O lady, I pray thee tell me thy name.\" And she answered: \"Those who\r\nlove me call me Pleasure, and those who hate me call me Evil.\" Then the\r\nother woman came forward and said: \"O Hercules, there is no road to\r\nhappiness except through toil and trouble; such is the gods' decree,\r\nand if thou wouldst be happy in thy life and honoured in thy death,\r\nthen up and follow me.\" And her name was Duty. And Hercules chose the\r\nbetter part, and went about the world redressing human wrong, and was\r\nreverenced by men and honoured by the gods--\r\n\r\n    Choose well; your choice is\r\n    Brief, and yet endless.\r\n    Here eyes do regard you\r\n    In Eternity's stillness;\r\n    Here is all fulness,\r\n    Ye brave, to reward you.\r\n    Work, and despair not!\r\n\r\n  GOETHE, tr. by Carlyle (_Past and Present_).\r\n\r\n\r\n214. CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Guido_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1575-1642). _See_ 11.\r\n\r\nIn pictures of this subject two distinct conceptions may be noticed.\r\nIn some the coronation of the Virgin is, as it were, dramatic; the\r\nsubject is represented, that is to say, as the closing act in the life\r\nof the Virgin, and saints and disciples appear in the foreground as\r\nwitnesses on earth of her coronation in heaven. No. 1155 is a good\r\ninstance of that treatment. This picture, on the other hand, shows the\r\nmystical treatment of the subject--the coronation of the Virgin being\r\nthe accepted type of the Church triumphant. The scene is laid entirely\r\nin heaven, and the only actors are the angels of the heavenly host.\r\nNotice the carefully symmetrical arrangement of the whole composition,\r\nas well as the charming faces of many of the angel chorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n215, 216. VARIOUS SAINTS.[115]\r\n\r\n  _School of Taddeo Gaddi_ (Florentine: 1300-1366).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      Taddeo Gaddi was the godson and pupil of Giotto, with whom he\r\n      lived twenty-four years, and whose tradition he faithfully\r\n      carried on: art had \"gone back,\" he used to say, \"since his\r\n      master's death.\" His most extensive works were the frescoes\r\n      in the Spanish Chapel in Santa Maria Novella (described in\r\n      ch. iv. of Ruskin's _Mornings in Florence_). Taddeo was also\r\n      distinguished as an architect. \"He built the Ponte Vecchio, and\r\n      the old stones of it were so laid by him that they are unshaken\r\n      to this day.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an air of settled peace, of abstract quietude, about this\r\ncompany of saints which is very impressive--something fixed in the\r\nattitude and features recalling the conventual life as described by St.\r\nBernard and paraphrased by Wordsworth in his _Ecclesiastical Sonnets_--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here Man more purely lives, less oft doth fall,\r\n    More promptly rises, walks with stricter heed,\r\n    More safely rests, dies happier, is freed\r\n    Earlier from cleansing fires, and gains withal\r\n    A brighter crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n218. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Peruzzi_ (Sienese: 1481-1536).\r\n\r\n      Baldassare Peruzzi, an excellent draughtsman and fair painter,\r\n      was most distinguished as an architect. His life, says Sir\r\n      Edward Poynter, was one which any artist might envy. \"Brought\r\n      up at his own wish as a painter at Siena, he soon gave\r\n      evidence of such talent that he was entrusted with important\r\n      commissions at Rome, making acquaintance by this means with one\r\n      of the great Roman patrons of art, Agostino Chigi, the same\r\n      for whom Raphael painted a chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo.\r\n      Baldassare found leisure to devote himself to the study of\r\n      architecture; from this time he seems to have had almost the\r\n      happiest lot that one can imagine falling to an artist, that\r\n      of building palaces and decorating them with his own hand\"\r\n      (_Lectures on Art_, ch. viii.). Among these were the Farnesina\r\n      Palace for Agostino Chigi, and the Palazzo Massimi, which is\r\n      \"justly considered one of the most beautiful and ingeniously\r\n      constructed in Rome.\" It is characteristic of the taste of the\r\n      time that what Vasari most admired in Peruzzi's buildings was\r\n      \"the decoration of the Loggia at the Villa Farnesina, painted\r\n      in perspective to imitate stucco work.\" \"This is done so\r\n      perfectly,\" he says, \"with the colours, that even experienced\r\n      artists have taken them to be works in relief. I remember that\r\n      Titian, a most excellent and renowned painter, whom I conducted\r\n      to see these works, could by no means be persuaded that they\r\n      were painted, and remained in astonishment when, on changing\r\n      his point of view, he perceived that they were so.\" Baldassare\r\n      also designed the fortifications of Siena, and on the death\r\n      of Raphael was appointed architect of St. Peter's at Rome.\r\n      His life was not free from adventures. At the sack of Rome\r\n      in 1527 he was plundered of all he possessed by the Imperial\r\n      soldiers, and was forced to paint a picture of their general,\r\n      the Constable Bourbon, who had been killed in the assault of\r\n      the city. He died at Rome, not without suspicion of having been\r\n      poisoned, and was buried in the Pantheon, near the tomb of\r\n      Raphael.\r\n\r\nThere is a drawing by Peruzzi of this subject in possession of the\r\nNational Gallery, No. 167. Girolamo da Treviso (623) made a copy of\r\nit, which is perhaps this work. The figures of the three magi are\r\ninteresting as having been portraits of Titian, Raphael, and Michael\r\nAngelo.\r\n\r\n\r\n219. THE DEAD CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Lombard School, 16th century).\r\n\r\nPerhaps to be ascribed to Bazzi (see under 1144).\r\n\r\n\r\n221. HIS OWN PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  =Rembrandt= (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45.\r\n\r\nCompare No. 672. That was painted when he was about thirty; this,\r\nsome thirty years later. We see here the same features, though worn\r\nby age; the same self-reliant expression, though broken down by\r\ncare. \"In manner,\" says Sir Walter Armstrong, \"it is amazingly free,\r\nirresponsible, and what in any one but a stupendous master we should\r\ncall careless. It looks as though he had taken up the first dirty\r\npalette on which he could lay his hands, and set himself to the making\r\nof a picture with no further thought. To those who put signs of mastery\r\nabove all other qualities, it is one of the most attractive pictures in\r\nthe whole Gallery\" (_Portfolio_, September 1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n222. A MAN'S PORTRAIT (dated 1433).\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Eyck_ (Early Flemish: about 1390-1440). _See_ 186.\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\nOne of Van Eyck's obviously truthful portraits, so highly finished that\r\nthe single hairs on the shaven chin are given. On the upper part of the\r\nframe is the inscription, \"Als ich kan\"--as I can, the first words of\r\nan old Flemish proverb, \"As I can, but not as I will,\"--an inscription\r\nbeautifully illustrative of a great man's modesty; accurately true\r\nalso as a piece of criticism. No pictures are more finished than Van\r\nEyck's, yet they are only \"as he can,\" not as he would. \"Let all the\r\ningenuity and all the art of the human race he brought to bear upon the\r\nattainment of the utmost possible finish, and they could not do what\r\nis done in the foot of a fly, or the film of a bubble. God alone can\r\nfinish; and the more intelligent the human mind becomes, the more the\r\ninfiniteness of interval is felt between human and divine work in this\r\nrespect\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt iv. ch. ix. § 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n223. DUTCH SHIPPING.\r\n\r\n  _Bakhuizen_ (Dutch: 1631-1708). _See_ 204.\r\n\r\n\r\n224. THE TRIBUTE MONEY.\r\n\r\n  _School of Titian. See under_ 4.\r\n\r\nThe Pharisee, hoping to entrap Jesus into sedition, asks him whether\r\nit is lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar. \"Show me _the tribute money_\"\r\nis the answer. \"Whose is this image and superscription?... Render unto\r\nCæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are\r\nGod's.\" Titian's great picture of this subject (painted about 1514) is\r\nat Dresden.\r\n\r\n\r\n225. BEATIFIC VISION OF THE MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Giulio Romano_ (Roman: 1498-1546). _See_ 624.\r\n\r\nA semicircular fresco (formerly in the church of the Trinita de' Monti,\r\nRome), showing the Magdalen borne upwards by angels to witness the joys\r\nof the blessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n226. VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH ST. JOHN AND ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _School of Botticelli_ (1447-1510). _See_ 1034.\r\n\r\nThis is a copy of a picture by Botticelli in the Rospigliosi Palace at\r\nRome. In the background is a hedge of roses, Botticelli's favourite\r\nflower. \"No man has ever yet drawn, and none is likely to draw for\r\nmany a day, roses as well as Sandro has drawn them\" (_Fors Clavigera_,\r\n1872, xii. 2). And he painted them, just as he painted his Madonnas,\r\nfrom life, and from everyday life--for even as late as forty years ago,\r\nFlorence was \"yet encircled by a wilderness of wild rose.\" It should be\r\nnoticed, further, that there was a constant Biblical reference in the\r\nflowers which the painters consecrated to their Madonnas--especially\r\nthe rose, the emblem of love and beauty. The background in Madonna\r\npictures is frequently, as here, a piece of garden trellis: \"a garden\r\nenclosed is my sister, my spouse\" (Song of Solomon, iv. 12).\r\n\r\n\r\n227. ST. JEROME IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n  _Florentine School_ (15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      Kneeling below are Girolamo Rucellai and his son. The arms of\r\n      the Rucellai family are at each end of the _predella_. The\r\n      picture was originally an altar-piece in the Rucellai Chapel\r\n      in the church of the Eremiti di San Girolamo at Fiesole.\r\n      Formerly ascribed to Cosimo Rosselli, the picture is now\r\n      conjecturally attributed to Botticini (for whom see under 1126).\r\n\r\nSt. Jerome (A.D. 342-420) who first made the great Eastern book, the\r\nBible, legible in the West, by translating the Hebrew into Latin, was\r\none of the chief saints of the Latin or Western Church, and was a\r\nfavourite subject in Christian art; there are a dozen pictures of him\r\nin the National Gallery alone. One of the chief events in his life\r\nis told in the left-hand compartment at the bottom of this picture.\r\nJerome is tending a sick lion, and in all the pictures of him a lion\r\nappears as his constant companion. The story is that one evening a lion\r\nentered the monastery, limping as in pain, and all the brethren fled in\r\nterror, as we see one of them doing here, whilst the others are looking\r\non safely behind a door; but Jerome went forward to meet the lion,\r\nas though he had been a guest. And the lion lifted up his paw, and\r\nJerome, finding it was wounded by a thorn, tended the wild creature,\r\nwhich henceforward became his constant companion and friend. What did\r\nthe Christian painters mean by their fond insistence on the constancy\r\nof the lion-friend? They meant to foretell a day \"when the Fear of Man\r\nshall be laid in benediction, not enmity, on inferior beings,--when\r\nthey shall not hurt or destroy in all the holy Mountain, and the Peace\r\nof the Earth shall be as far removed from its present sorrow, as the\r\npresent gloriously animate universe from the nascent desert, whose\r\ndeeps were the place of dragons, and its mountains, domes of fire. Of\r\nthat day knoweth no man; but the Kingdom of God is already come to\r\nthose who have tamed in their own hearts what was rampant of the lower\r\nnature, and have learned to cherish what is lovely and human, in the\r\nwandering children of the clouds and fields\" (_Bible of Amiens_, ch.\r\niii. § 54). The other compartments depict incidents in the lives of St.\r\nDamasus, St. Eusebius, St. Paula, and St. Eustache--saints associated\r\nwith St. Jerome. The picture itself shows an earlier period of his\r\nlife, when, before he settled in a monastery, but after a life of\r\npleasure in Rome, he left (as he himself tells us) not only parents and\r\nkindred, but the accustomed luxuries of delicate life, and lived for\r\nten years in the desert in the effort to obtain some closer knowledge\r\nof the Being and Will of God. The saints who are made by the painter to\r\nkeep St. Jerome company below are in sorrow; the angels above, in joy.\r\nThe other kneeling figures are portraits of the patron for whom the\r\npicture was painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n228. CHRIST AND THE MONEY-CHANGERS.\r\n\r\n  _Bassano_ (Venetian: 1510-1592). _See_ 173.\r\n\r\nChrist is driving out from the House of Prayer all those who had made\r\nit a den of thieves--money-changers, dealers in cattle, sheep, goats,\r\nbirds, etc. A subject which lent itself conveniently to Bassano's\r\ncharacteristic _genre_ style.\r\n\r\n\r\n230. A FRANCISCAN MONK.\r\n\r\n  _Francisco Zurbaran_ (Spanish: 1598-1662).\r\n\r\n      Zurbaran--the contemporary of Velazquez--unites in a\r\n      typical manner the two main characteristics of the Spanish\r\n      School--asceticism in subject, realism in presentment. He\r\n      is, says Stirling-Maxwell, the peculiar painter of monks, as\r\n      Raphael is of Madonnas, and Ribera of martyrdoms; he studied\r\n      the Spanish friar, and painted him with as high a relish as\r\n      Titian painted the Venetian noble, and Vandyck the gentleman of\r\n      England. In the Museum of Seville are several pictures which he\r\n      painted for the Carthusians of that city. \"The venerable friars\r\n      seem portraits; each differs in feature from the other, yet all\r\n      bear the impress of long years of solitary and silent penance;\r\n      their white draperies chill the eye, as their cold hopeless\r\n      faces chill the heart; and the whole scene is brought before\r\n      us with a vivid fidelity, which shows that Zurbaran studied\r\n      the Carthusian in his native cloisters with the like close and\r\n      faithful attention that Velazquez bestowed on the courtier,\r\n      strutting it in the corridors of the Alcazar or the alleys\r\n      of Aranjuez\" (_Annals of the Artists of Spain_, ch. xi.).\r\n      Zurbaran was the son of a peasant, but having shown an early\r\n      talent for drawing was released from the plough and sent to the\r\n      studio of the painter-priest Juan de Roelas, at Seville. His\r\n      abilities and his close study of nature soon gained him a high\r\n      reputation; his forcible naturalistic style acquired for him\r\n      the name of \"the Caravaggio of Spain.\" He was employed in the\r\n      cathedral of Seville, which remained his abode for the greater\r\n      part of his life. In his picture of \"St. Thomas Aquinas\" in\r\n      the museum there, the dark wild face, immediately behind the\r\n      Imperial adorer, is traditionally held to be the portrait of\r\n      Zurbaran himself. His habits were those of the recluse, but\r\n      in 1650 he was, through the influence of Velazquez, called\r\n      to Madrid. There he was set to a task little suited to his\r\n      tastes--the production of a series of pictures (now in the\r\n      Prado) to illustrate the labours of Hercules. Philip IV. used,\r\n      we are told, to visit the artist whilst engaged on these\r\n      pictures, and on one occasion expressed his admiration of his\r\n      powers by laying his hand on his shoulder, and calling him\r\n      \"painter of the King, and king of the painters.\" \"His best\r\n      characteristic,\" says Burton, \"is his power of imparting the\r\n      sense of life to the heads of his figures. He was in fact a\r\n      great, though not a professed, portrait painter.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a transcript from the religious life around him that Zurbaran\r\nhere sets before us. Seville was the most orthodox city in the most\r\nCatholic country--at every corner of the streets there were Franciscan\r\nmonks, with prayers or charms to sell in exchange for food or money.\r\n\"For centuries in Spain country people bought up the monks' old garbs,\r\nto use them in dressing the dead, so that St. Peter might pass them\r\ninto heaven thinking they were Franciscans.\" It was in the streets and\r\nconvents of Seville therefore that Zurbaran found his models. This\r\npicture was bought for the National Gallery from the Louis Philippe\r\nsale in 1853. When the gallery of Spanish pictures to which it formerly\r\nbelonged was inaugurated in the Louvre, \"what remained most strongly\r\nin the Parisian mind, so impressionable and so _blasé_, was not the\r\nsuavity of Murillo, nor the astonishing pencil of Velazquez, making\r\nthe canvas speak and palpitate with life; it was a certain 'Monk in\r\nprayer' of Zurbaran, which it was impossible to forget, even if one\r\nhad seen it only once\" (C. Blanc, cited in W. B. Scott's _Murillo_,\r\np. 55). \"Of his gloomy monastic studies,\" says Stirling-Maxwell, \"the\r\nkneeling Franciscan holding a skull is one of the ablest; the face,\r\ndimly seen beneath the brown hood, is turned to heaven; no trace of\r\nearthly expression is left on its pale features, but the wild eyes seem\r\nfixed on some dismal vision; and a single glance at the canvas imprints\r\nthe figure on the memory for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n232. THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.\r\n\r\n  _Francisco Zurbaran_ (Spanish: 1598-1662). _See_ 230.\r\n\r\nA characteristic and fine example of the naturalistic treatment of\r\nsuch subjects by the Spanish School; formerly supposed to be an\r\nearly work of Velazquez, now attributed by the authorities of the\r\nGallery, following M. de Beruete, to Zurbaran.[116] The affinity of\r\nthe Spanish School in this respect to the Italian naturalists may be\r\nseen by a glance at No. 172 in the late Italian Room. In the distance\r\nis the guiding angel as the star of the Epiphany. It is a pretty\r\npiece of observation of child nature that makes the painter show the\r\nboy offering his animals to the infant Christ. One remembers George\r\nEliot's \"young Daniel\" (in _Scenes of Clerical Life_), who says to Mr.\r\nGilfil, by way of making friends, \"We've got two pups, shall I show\r\n'em yer? One's got white spots.\" Zurbaran was noted for his successful\r\ndelineation of animals. Palomino mentions with approbation his picture\r\nof an enraged dog from which chance observers used to run away, and of\r\na yearling lamb, deemed by the possessor of more value than a hecatomb\r\nof full-grown sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n234. A WARRIOR ADORING THE INFANT CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Catena_ (Venetian: died 1531).\r\n\r\n      Of Vincenzo di Biagio, commonly called Catena (possibly from a\r\n      partiality for jewellery), little is known, and until recently\r\n      little was heard. Modern critics have, however, decided that\r\n      he was one of the ablest of the School of Bellini, and have\r\n      attributed to him many beautiful works, which have hitherto\r\n      borne famous names.[117] He was born at Treviso; his first\r\n      master was probably the elder Girolamo da Treviso, but he\r\n      must have finished his artistic education in the School of\r\n      Bellini. Signed pictures from his hand are to be found in\r\n      several of the Venetian churches and elsewhere. He was fond of\r\n      introducing a partridge (as here and in 694) and a white poodle\r\n      dog (as here) into his pictures, by which they may often be\r\n      recognised. An altar-piece, representing S. Cristina in the\r\n      church of S. Maria Mater Domini, and another of S. Giustina in\r\n      S. Simpliciana are referred to as offering marked analogies\r\n      with the work now before us. A letter is extant, dated April\r\n      11, 1520, when Raphael was just deceased and Michelangelo\r\n      infirm, in which Catena is recommended to be on his guard,\r\n      \"since danger seems to be impending over all very excellent\r\n      painters.\" He was famous for his portraits; the portrait of\r\n      Count Raimund Fugger, specially praised by Vasari, is now at\r\n      Berlin. He died in 1531, in which year he made a will leaving\r\n      legacies to a number of poor painters, and the greater part\r\n      of his substance to the Guild of his art. In his later works\r\n      the influence of Giorgione is strongly marked--as here in the\r\n      rich full colour of the Kneeling Knight, and in other respects.\r\n      \"Giorgione,\" says Mr. Berenson, \"created a demand which other\r\n      painters were forced to supply. One of them, turning toward the\r\n      new in a way that is full of singular charm, gave his later\r\n      works all the beauty and softness of the first spring days in\r\n      Italy. Upon hearing the title of one of Catena's works in the\r\n      National Gallery, _A Warrior Adoring the Infant Christ_, who\r\n      could imagine what a treat the picture itself had in store\r\n      for him? It is a fragrant summer landscape enjoyed by a few\r\n      quiet people, one of whom, in armour, with the glamour of the\r\n      Orient about him, kneels at the Virgin's feet, while a romantic\r\n      young page holds his horse's bridle. A good instance of the\r\n      Giorgionesque way of treating a subject; not for the story, nor\r\n      for the display of skill, nor for the obvious feeling, but for\r\n      the lovely landscape, for the effects of light and colour, and\r\n      for the sweetness of human relations\" (_The Venetian Painters\r\n      of the Renaissance_, p. 31).\r\n\r\nObserve, for the technical merits of this picture, the horse-bridle:\r\n\"An example of true painter's work in minor detail; unsurpassable,\r\nbut not, by patience and modesty, inimitable\" (_Academy Notes_, 1875,\r\np. 48). As for the subject, the warrior portrayed is nameless. This\r\nis suggestive; it is not a peculiar picture, it is a type of what was\r\nthe common method of Venetian portraiture. \"An English gentleman,\r\ndesiring his portrait, gives probably to the painter a choice of\r\nseveral actions, in any of which he is willing to be represented.\r\nAs for instance, riding his best horse, shooting with his favourite\r\npointer, manifesting himself in his robes of state on some great\r\npublic occasion, meditating in his study, playing with his children,\r\nor visiting his tenants; in any of these or other such circumstances,\r\nhe will give the artist free leave to paint him. But in one important\r\naction he would shrink even from the suggestion of being drawn. He will\r\nassuredly not let himself be painted praying. Strangely, this is the\r\naction which, of all others, a Venetian desires to be painted in. If\r\nthey want a noble and complete portrait, they nearly all choose to be\r\npainted on their knees\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. iii.\r\n§ 15). Notice also the little dog in the corner--\"one of the little\r\ncurly, short-nosed, fringy-pawed things which all Venetian ladies\r\npetted.\" \"The dog is thus constantly introduced by the Venetians (in\r\nMadonna pictures) in order to give the fullest contrast to the highest\r\ntones of human thought and feeling.... But they saw the noble qualities\r\nof the dog too--all his patience, love, and faithfulness ...,\" and\r\nintroduced him into their sacred pictures partly therefore in order\r\nto show that \"all the lower creatures, who can love, have passed,\r\nthrough their love, into the guardianship and guidance of angels\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. iii. § 21, ch. vi. § 14; _Fors\r\nClavigera_, 1877, p. 31).[118]\r\n\r\n\r\n235. THE DEAD CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Giuseppe Ribera, called Spagnoletto_ (Spanish: 1598-1648).\r\n\r\n      Ribera is a leading artist amongst what are called the\r\n      _Naturalisti_ or _Tenebrosi_ (an alternative title, curiously\r\n      significant of the warped and degraded principle of the\r\n      school, as if \"nature\" were indeed only another name for\r\n      \"darkness\").[119] His works show remarkable force and facility;\r\n      his subjects were painful. As Byron says--\r\n\r\n                          Spagnoletto tainted\r\n    His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.\r\n\r\n      \"It is a curious example of the perversity of the human mind,\"\r\n      says Stirling-Maxwell, \"that subjects like these should have\r\n      been the chosen recreations of an eye that opened in infancy on\r\n      the palms and the fair women of Valencia, and rested for half\r\n      a lifetime on the splendour of the Bay of Naples.\" His life\r\n      was like his art, being \"one long contrast between splendour\r\n      and misery, black shadow and shining light\" (Scott). He made\r\n      his way when quite a youth to Rome, where one day, as he was\r\n      sketching in the streets, dressed in rags and eating crusts,\r\n      he was picked up by a cardinal and taken into his household.\r\n      They called him in Italy, owing to his small stature, by the\r\n      name Lo Spagnoletto, the little Spaniard. But Ribera could\r\n      not brook the cardinal's livery, and stole away into poverty\r\n      and independence again. He especially studied the works of\r\n      Caravaggio, and went afterwards to Parma to study Correggio.\r\n      Then he moved to Naples, where a picture-dealer discovered his\r\n      talent and gave him his daughter in marriage. A large picture\r\n      of the martyrdom of St. Bartholomew, which he painted about\r\n      this time, was exhibited by the dealer on the balcony of his\r\n      house, and created such a _furore_ that the Spanish Viceroy,\r\n      delighted at finding the painter to be a Spaniard, loaded him\r\n      with appointments and commissions. This was the making of\r\n      Ribera's fortune. He soon became very wealthy--never going out\r\n      but in his carriage, and with an equerry to accompany him, and\r\n      so hard had he to work to keep pace with his orders that his\r\n      servants were instructed at last to interrupt him when working\r\n      hours were fairly over. He kept open house--entertaining\r\n      Velazquez, for instance, when the latter visited Naples in\r\n      1630; but though lavish he was yet mean. Ribera, Corenzio (a\r\n      Greek), and Caracciolo (a Neapolitan), formed a memorable\r\n      cabal, with the object of establishing a local monopoly in\r\n      the artistic profession for themselves. In this object, by\r\n      means of force and fraud, they succeeded for many years.\r\n      Domenichino, Annibale Carracci, and Guido Reni were all more\r\n      or less victims of the cabal. The story of the conspiracy of\r\n      Ribera and his allies to get the commission for painting the\r\n      chapel of St. Januarius, forms one of the most curious and\r\n      disgraceful chapters in the history of art, and may be read in\r\n      Lanzi's _History of Painting_ (vol. ii. in Bohn's translation).\r\n      Ribera's life ended like his pictures, in darkness. His\r\n      daughter was carried off by one of his great friends, Don Juan\r\n      of Austria, and Ribera was so overwhelmed with grief that he\r\n      left Naples and was never more heard of.[120]\r\n\r\nThe Virgin, accompanied here by St. John and Mary Magdalen, is weeping\r\nover the dead Christ--the subject termed by the Italians a _Pietà_. It\r\nis instructive to compare this Spanish treatment of it with an Italian\r\nPietà, such as Francia's No. 180. How much more ghastly is the dead\r\nChrist here! How much less tender are the ministering mourners!\r\n\r\n\r\n236. CASTLE OF SANT' ANGELO, ROME.\r\n\r\n  _Claude Joseph Vernet_ (French: 1714-1789).\r\n\r\n      Vernet, one of the most celebrated of French landscape and\r\n      marine painters, received his inspiration and lived a large\r\n      part of his life in Italy. He was born at Avignon, and in 1732\r\n      went to Italy with a view of improving himself in historical\r\n      painting, but the beautiful scenery of Genoa and Naples\r\n      induced him to devote himself to marine landscape. One of his\r\n      Mediterranean pictures is No. 1393 in this Gallery. It is\r\n      said that on his first voyage he was so impressed with the\r\n      effect of a stormy sea as to have himself tied to the mast\r\n      in order to be able more accurately to observe it. For some\r\n      time Vernet lived in poverty. He had to paint carriages, and\r\n      a picture, afterwards sold for 5000 francs, procured him only\r\n      a single suit of clothes. His subjects were now the rivers,\r\n      landscapes, and costumes of Rome (as in this picture). In 1752\r\n      he was invited to Paris by Louis XV. In the following year\r\n      he was elected a member of the French Academy of Arts, and\r\n      was commissioned by the Government to paint his celebrated\r\n      pictures, now in the Louvre, of the seaports of France. This\r\n      task occupied him the greater part of the year. He died in\r\n      the Louvre, where he had been given apartments by the king.\r\n      His last years were embittered by the madness of his wife, a\r\n      daughter of the Pope's naval commandant, whom he had married\r\n      in 1745. He was the grandfather of the celebrated historical\r\n      painter, Horace Vernet (see 1285).\r\n\r\nPast and present in the eternal city, as it was in Vernet's day. Behind\r\nis the castle which the Emperor Hadrian had built for his family tomb,\r\nin which were buried several of the Emperors after him, and the history\r\nof which in the Middle Ages was almost the history of Rome itself. In\r\nfront is a fête on the Tiber, with a fashionable crowd in crinolines\r\nwatching the boats tilting on the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n237. A WOMAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See 45._\r\n\r\nOf interest as being one of his last works: dated 1666.\r\n\r\n\r\n238. DEAD GAME.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Weenix_ (Dutch: 1640-1719).\r\n\r\n      Jan Weenix, the younger, was born at Amsterdam--the son of\r\n      Jan Baptista Weenix (see 1096)--and is usually considered\r\n      the best of all Dutch artists in this style. For some years\r\n      he was employed at the Court of John William, Elector of the\r\n      Palatinate.\r\n\r\nA stag, a couple of hares (a speciality with this artist), a heron, and\r\na fowling-piece.\r\n\r\n\r\n239. A MOONLIGHT SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Aart van der Neer_ (Dutch: 1603-1677). _See_ 152.\r\n\r\nA good example of \"the penetrating melancholy of moonlight\"--an effect\r\nin which this painter excelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n240. CROSSING THE FORD.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Berchem_ (Dutch: 1620-1683). _See_ 78.\r\n\r\n\r\n242. THE GAME OF BACKGAMMON.\r\n\r\n  _Teniers_ (Flemish: 1610-1694). _See_ 154.\r\n\r\n\"An example,\" says Mr. J. T. Nettleship in a comparison between Morland\r\nand some of the Dutch masters, \"not only of the works that Morland\r\nloved, but of the life (alas!) he best loved too. In one respect it\r\nat once takes rank above the English painter, for every man must be a\r\nportrait; the two playing might indeed be English as well as Dutch, the\r\nman looking on is a degraded boor. In the chimney-place are several men\r\nfarther off--one with his back to you is seated on a bench with his\r\nhead against the chimney-jamb, a 'poor drinker,' he seems. The standing\r\nman, standing with his back to the fire, smoking a long clay, looks\r\nhalf-pitying, half-scornful at the feebler sinner\" (_George Morland_,\r\np. 23).\r\n\r\n\r\n243. AN OLD MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See_ 45.\r\n\r\nA noble picture of the dignity of old age (dated 1659).\r\n\r\n\r\n244. A SHEPHERD WITH A LAMB.\r\n\r\n  _Spagnoletto_ (Spanish: 1598-1648). _See_ 235.\r\n\r\n\r\n245. PORTRAIT OF A SENATOR.\r\n\r\n  _Hans Baldung_ (German-Swabian: 1476-1545).\r\n\r\n      This portrait is dated 1514, and signed with the monogram\r\n      of Albert Dürer, to whom it was formerly ascribed. But the\r\n      monogram is now said to be a forgery, and the picture is\r\n      identified as the work of Dürer's friend Baldung. On the death\r\n      of Dürer (in 1528) Baldung received a lock of his hair (now\r\n      preserved in the Library of the Academy of Arts at Vienna), and\r\n      Dürer, in his Journal in the Low Countries, records having sold\r\n      several of Baldung's engravings. Baldung, painter, engraver,\r\n      and designer, was a native of Gmünd in Swabia, and his earliest\r\n      works show the influence of Martin Schongauer (see 658). He\r\n      lived at Freiburg-in-the-Breisgau (in the monastery at which\r\n      place is his greatest work, a \"Coronation of the Virgin\"),\r\n      and also at Strassburg, of which latter city he became a\r\n      senator shortly before his death. Baldung's portraits, says\r\n      the Official Catalogue, \"are highly individual and full of\r\n      character. When unsigned they have sometimes passed for the\r\n      work of Dürer, but they want his searching modelling.\" Baldung\r\n      acquired and adopted the name of Green or Grün, either from his\r\n      habit of dressing in that colour or from his fondness for a\r\n      peculiarly brilliant tint of green often found in his pictures.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Dürer was strong on Hans Baldung, and a similar spirit\r\nis discernible in the works of both painters. This old man, strong and\r\nyet melancholy, is precisely true to Dürer's favourite type of human\r\nstrength founded on labour and sorrow. And the choice of this type is\r\ncharacteristic of his mind. With the Reformation came, says Mr. Ruskin,\r\n\"the Resurrection of Death. Never, since man first saw him face to\r\nface, had his terror been so great.\" Nothing shows the character of men\r\nof that time so clearly as the way in which they severally meet the\r\nKing of Terror. \"It haunted Dürer long; and the answer he gave to the\r\nquestion of the grave was that of patient hope; and twofold, consisting\r\nof one design in praise of Fortitude, and another in praise of\r\nLabour.... The plate of 'Melancholia' is the history of the sorrowful\r\ntoil of the earth, as the 'Knight and Death' is of its sorrowful\r\npatience under temptation\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. iv.).\r\n\r\n\r\n246. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Girolamo del Pacchia_ (Sienese: 1477-1535).\r\n\r\n      Pacchia, who is often confused with his fellow-countryman\r\n      Pacchiarotto, was born at Siena, being the son of a\r\n      cannon-founder from Croatia who had settled in that city.\r\n      He first studied in his native town, but afterwards went to\r\n      Florence. His works recall the style of the Florentine masters\r\n      of the time. In 1500 he went to Rome, returning to Siena with\r\n      an established reputation in 1508. Many of his works are to be\r\n      seen in the churches and picture-gallery in that city, famous\r\n      alike for its religious revivals, its artistic activity, and\r\n      its civic turbulence. Pacchia, in company with Pacchiarotti,\r\n      joined the revolutionary club of the Bardotti, and on its\r\n      suppression in 1535 the two artists fled the city. After that\r\n      date no record of Pacchia has been found.\r\n\r\nThis graceful picture resembles the style of Andrea del Sarto.\r\n\r\n\r\n247. \"ECCO HOMO!\"\r\n\r\n  _Matteo di Giovanni_ (Sienese: 1435-1495). _See_ 1155.\r\n\r\n\"Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple\r\nrobe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!\" (Ecco Homo) (St.\r\nJohn xix. 5). In the \"glory\" around the head are the Latin letters\r\nsignifying \"Jesus Christ of Nazareth\"; on the outer edge of the\r\nbackground, \"at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in\r\nheaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth\" (Philippians\r\nii. 10).\r\n\r\n\r\n248. THE VISION OF ST. BERNARD.\r\n\r\n  _Fra Filippo Lippi_ (Florentine: about 1406-1469). _See_ 666.\r\n\r\n\"St. Bernard was remarkable for his devotion to the blessed Virgin; one\r\nof his most celebrated works, the _Missus est_, was composed in her\r\nhonour as mother of the Redeemer; and in eighty sermons from the Song\r\nof Solomon he set forth her divine perfection. His health was extremely\r\nfeeble; and once, when he was employed in writing his homilies, and was\r\nso ill that he could scarcely hold the pen, she graciously appeared\r\nto him, and comforted and restored him by her divine presence\" (Mrs.\r\nJameson: _Legends of the Monastic Orders_, p. 152). Notice the peculiar\r\nshape of the picture, the upper corners of the square being cut away.\r\nThe picture was painted in 1447 (the artist receiving 40 _lire_, equal\r\nnow perhaps to £60, for it and another work) to fit a space over\r\nthe door of the Palazzo della Signoria at Florence. \"Have you ever\r\nconsidered, in the early history of painting, how important is the\r\nhistory of the frame-maker? It is a matter, I assure you, needing your\r\nvery best consideration, for the frame was made before the picture. The\r\npainted window is much, but the aperture it fills was thought of before\r\nit. The fresco by Giotto is much, but the vault it adorns was planned\r\nfirst ... and in pointing out to you this fact, I may once for all\r\nprove to, you the essential unity of the arts\" (_Ariadne Florentina_,\r\n§§ 59, 60).\r\n\r\n\r\n249. THE MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE OF SIENA.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo di San Severino_ (Umbrian: painted 1483-1496).\r\n\r\n      This picture is signed by the artist \"Laurentius _the second_\r\n      of Severino\"--to distinguish himself from the earlier Lorenzo,\r\n      who was born in 1374, and who painted some frescoes at Urbino\r\n      in 1416. The date of this picture is approximately fixed by\r\n      the fact that Catherine is described on her nimbus as \"saint,\"\r\n      and she was not canonised till 1461; and perhaps also by the\r\n      influence on Lorenzo of Crivelli (painted 1468-1493), which has\r\n      been traced in the execution of the details: see for instance\r\n      the cucumber and apple on the step of the throne (_cf._ 724,\r\n      etc).\r\n\r\nSt. Catherine of Siena (1347-1380) is one of the most remarkable\r\nfigures of the Middle Ages. She was the daughter of a dyer, brought\r\nup in the humblest of surroundings, and wholly uneducated. When only\r\nthirteen she entered the monastic life as a nun of the Dominican\r\norder (St. Dominic is here present on the right), and at once became\r\nfamous in the city for her good works. She tended the sick and\r\nplague-stricken, and was a minister of mercy to the worst and meanest\r\nof her fellow-creatures. On one occasion a hardened murderer, whom\r\npriests had visited in vain, was so subdued by her tenderness that he\r\nconfessed his sins, begged her to wait for him by the scaffold, and\r\ndied with the names of Jesus and Catherine on his lips. In addition to\r\nher piety and zeal she succeeded as a mediator between Florence and\r\nher native city, and between Florence and the Pope; she travelled to\r\nAvignon, and there induced Gregory XI. to return to Rome; she narrowly\r\nescaped political martyrdom during one of her embassies from Gregory\r\nto the Florentine republic; she preached a crusade against the Turks,\r\nand she aided, by her dying words, to keep Pope Urban on the throne.\r\nBut \"when she died she left behind her a memory of love more than of\r\npower, the fragrance of an unselfish and gentle life. Her place is in\r\nthe heart of the humble. Her prayer is still whispered by poor children\r\non their mother's knee, and her relics are kissed daily by the simple\r\nand devout.\"\r\n\r\nThe mystical marriage which forms the subject of this picture, where\r\nthe infant Christ is placing the ring on her finger, suggests the\r\nsecret of her power. Once when she was fasting and praying, Christ\r\nhimself appeared to her, she said, and gave her his heart. For love\r\nwas the keynote of her religion, and the mainspring of her life.\r\nIn no merely figurative sense did she regard herself as the spouse\r\nof Christ; she dwelt upon the bliss, beyond all mortal happiness,\r\nwhich she enjoyed in supersensual communion with her Lord. The world\r\nhas not lost its ladies of the race of St. Catherine, beautiful and\r\npure and holy, who live lives of saintly mercy in the power of human\r\nand heavenly love. (See further, for St. Catherine of Siena, J. A.\r\nSymonds, _Sketches in Italy_ (Siena), from which the above account is\r\nprincipally taken.)\r\n\r\n\r\n250. FOUR SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _The Meister von Werden_ (German: 15th Century).\r\n\r\n      The Meister von Werden, or the painter of this picture and of\r\n      Nos. 251 and 253, which were found in the old Abbey of Werden,\r\n      near Düsseldorf, is otherwise unknown. These three pictures\r\n      probably formed folding wings of an altar-piece. A fourth\r\n      panel, belonging to the same series, is in the National Gallery\r\n      of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe saints in this picture are Jerome (with his lion), Benedict (in the\r\nhabit of his order), Giles (with his doe), and Romuald (founder of the\r\neremite order of the Camaldoli).\r\n\r\n\r\n251. FOUR SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _The Meister von Werden. See under_ 250.\r\n\r\nThe saints in this picture are Augustine (with the heart transfixed\r\nwith an arrow), Ludger (Bishop of Münster, Apostle of Saxony), Hubert\r\n(patron saint of the chase, see No. 783) and Maurice.\r\n\r\n\r\n252. THE CONVERSION OF ST. HUBERT.\r\n\r\n  _The Meister von Werden. See under_ 250.\r\n\r\n\r\n253. THE MASS OF ST. HUBERT.\r\n\r\n  _The Meister von Werden. See under_ 250.\r\n\r\nFor St. Hubert, see under 783. Here the saint, in his canonicals, is\r\nrepresented bending before the altar; while an angel from heaven is,\r\naccording to the legend, descending with the stole.\r\n\r\n\r\n254-261. FRAGMENTS OF AN ALTAR-PIECE.\r\n\r\n_The Meister von Liesborn_ (German: about 1465).\r\n\r\n      The principal work of this master, whose name has not come\r\n      down to us, was a high altar-piece for a convent church of the\r\n      Benedictines at Liesborn, near Münster in Westphalia. This\r\n      work was cut in pieces and sold in 1807, when the convent was\r\n      suspended, and Napoleon established the modern kingdom of\r\n      Westphalia. Some of the pieces were afterwards lost, some were\r\n      obtained by different collectors, while others, which were\r\n      acquired by Herr Krüger of Minden, were purchased in 1854 by\r\n      the British Government. The sweet but feeble faces, with the\r\n      gold background, recall the earliest Lower Rhine School, of\r\n      which the Westphalian was an offshoot.\r\n\r\nIn 259--a Head of Christ on the Cross--we have a fragment of the centre\r\ncompartment of the altar-piece.\r\n\r\nIn 260 and 261 we have the saints who stood by the side of the Cross\r\n(hence their melancholy expression). In 260 the saints are St. John,\r\nSt. Benedict, and St. Scholastica (the first Benedictine nun and the\r\nsister of St. Benedict himself). In 261 the saints are Sts. Cosmas and\r\nDamian (see under 594), and the Virgin.\r\n\r\nIn 254 and 255 we have other saints: in 254, St. Ambrose (see under\r\n50), St. Exuperius (a Bishop of Toulouse), and St. Jerome (saying, as\r\nit were, \"Down, down\" to his lion); in 255, St. Gregory, St. Hilary,\r\nand St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the central groups in the altar-piece were\r\nrepresented various sacred subjects. No. 256, represents the\r\nAnnunciation; No. 257, the Purification of the Virgin and the\r\nPresentation of Christ in the Temple; No. 258, The Adoration of the\r\nMagi.\r\n\r\n\r\n262. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _School of the Meister von Liesborn. See under_ last pictures.\r\n\r\nIn the form of a predella or decoration of the base of the altar-piece.\r\nIn the centre is Christ on the Cross; on either side are four Saints;\r\non the left St. Scholastica, Mary Magdalen, St. Anne with the Virgin in\r\nher arms, who holds the Infant Christ; and the Virgin. On the right St.\r\nJohn the Evangelist, St. Andrew, St. Benedict, and St. Agnes with the\r\nLamb. In the background is a representation of Jerusalem; here depicted\r\nas a little Westphalian town.\r\n\r\n\r\n264. A COUNT OF HAINAULT AND HIS PATRON SAINT.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish).\r\n\r\nThe count and the confessor. The count, attired as a monk, is praying.\r\nBehind him is his patron saint (St. Ambrose), holding a cross in\r\none hand, a scourge in the other. More important, however, than the\r\npenitence of the count is the splendour of the robes. The picture is a\r\ngood illustration of the love of jewellery characteristic of the time.\r\n\"That this love of jewels was shared by the painters is sufficiently\r\nshown by the amount and beauty of the jewelled ornaments introduced by\r\nthem into their pictures. Not only are brooches and clasps, sceptres\r\nand crowns, studded with precious stones, but the hems of garments\r\nare continually sewn with them, whilst gloves and shoes of state are\r\nlikewise so adorned\" (Conway, p. 121). This picture is by some ascribed\r\nto Gerard van der Meire (see under 1078).\r\n\r\n\r\n265. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish School: Early 16th Century).\r\n\r\n\r\n266. THE DEPOSITION FROM THE CROSS.\r\n\r\n  _Lambert Lombard_ (Flemish: 1505-1566).\r\n\r\n      Lambert Lombard of Liège was, says Vasari, \"a distinguished\r\n      man of letters, a most judicious painter, and an admirable\r\n      architect.\" His pictures, which are scarce, are generally\r\n      remarkable for correctness of drawing, but his colouring was\r\n      thin and cold. Lombard, who was a pupil of Mabuse (see 656),\r\n      travelled as a young man in Germany and France, and visited\r\n      Italy in the suite of Cardinal Pole, when he became acquainted\r\n      with Vasari. On his return he opened a school at Liège.\r\n\r\n\r\n268. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Veronese_ (Veronese: 1528-1588). _See under_ 26.\r\n\r\nA striking example of the old symbolical conception, according to which\r\nthe adoration of the Magi--the tribute of the wise men from the East\r\nto the dawning star of Christianity--was represented as taking place\r\nin the ruins of an antique temple, signifying that Christianity was\r\nfounded upon the ruins of Paganism. This picture was painted in 1573\r\nfor the church of San Silvestro in Venice, where it remained until\r\n1835. It is mentioned in most of the guidebooks and descriptions of\r\nVenice. One of these published in 1792 says, in describing the church\r\nof San Silvestro: \"Many are the pictures by Tintoretto, by scholars of\r\nTitian, by Palma Vecchio, etc.; but among them all the famous Adoration\r\nof the Magi by Paolo Veronese deserves especial attention.\" The picture\r\nhas recently been covered with glass, an operation which is noteworthy\r\non account of the great size of the pane required, 11 ft. 7 in. by 10\r\nft. 7 in. The pane had to be obtained in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n269. A KNIGHT IN ARMOUR.\r\n\r\n  _Giorgione_ (Venetian: 1477-1510).\r\n\r\n      Giorgio[121] of Castelfranco, called Giorgione, George the\r\n      Great,--a name given him, according to Vasari, \"because of\r\n      the gifts of his person and the greatness of his mind,\"--is\r\n      one of the most renowned of the old masters, and exercised a\r\n      deeper influence upon the artists of his time than any other\r\n      painter. He was the fellow-pupil with Titian of Bellini at\r\n      Venice, and after executing works at his native place was\r\n      employed in Venice. Here by way of exhibiting a specimen of his\r\n      ability, he decorated the front of his house with frescoes.\r\n      He was afterwards employed in conjunction with Titian there\r\n      to decorate the façade of the Fondaco de' Tedeschi. These\r\n      paintings have been destroyed by the sea-winds.[122] But what\r\n      was more original in Giorgione's work was his small subject\r\n      pictures. He was, says Pater, \"the inventor of _genre_, of\r\n      those easily movable pictures which serve for uses neither of\r\n      devotion, nor of allegorical or historical teaching--little\r\n      groups of real men and women, amid congruous furniture or\r\n      landscape--morsels of actual life, conversation or music or\r\n      play, refined upon or idealised, till they come to seem like\r\n      glimpses of life from afar.\" Some of Bellini's late works\r\n      are already of this kind; but they were a little too austere\r\n      and sober in colour for the taste of the time. Carpaccio was\r\n      full of brilliancy, fancy, and gaiety, but he painted few\r\n      easel pictures. Giorgione brought to the new style all the\r\n      resources of a poetical imagination, of a happy temper, and\r\n      of supreme gifts as a colourist. He was, says Ruskin, one of\r\n      \"the seven supreme colourists.\"[123] The chief colour on his\r\n      palette, it has been said, was sunlight. In the glowing colour\r\n      with which he invested the human form \"the sense of nudity is\r\n      utterly lost, and there is no need nor desire of concealment\r\n      any more, but his naked figures move among the trees like\r\n      fiery pillars, and lie on the grass like flakes of sunshine\"\r\n      (_Modern Painters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. xiv. § 20).\r\n      Giorgione, says Mr. Colvin, came to enrich Venetian painting\r\n      further, with \"a stronger sense of life and of the glory of\r\n      the real world as distinguished from the solemn dreamland of\r\n      the religious imagination. He had a power hitherto unknown\r\n      of interpreting both the charm of merely human grace and\r\n      distinction, and the natural joy of life in the golden sunlight\r\n      among woods and meadows.\" Giorgione, by his originality and\r\n      his exact correspondence with the spirit of the time, created\r\n      a demand which other painters were forced to supply. His\r\n      influence, says Morelli, is not only to be traced in the\r\n      early work of Titian; it stands out broadly in the paintings\r\n      of nearly all his Venetian contemporaries--Lotto, Palma,\r\n      Pordenone, Bonifacio, Cariani, and many others, not to speak\r\n      of his scholar, Sebastiano del Piombo. The surviving pictures\r\n      which are undoubtedly by Giorgione's own hand are very few.\r\n      This category hardly includes more than four,--the altar-piece\r\n      at Castelfranco (see below), the so-called \"Famiglia di\r\n      Giorgione\" (now identified as \"Adrastus and Hypsipyle,\" in the\r\n      Palazzo Giovanelli at Venice), the \"Three Philosophers\" (in\r\n      the Belvedere at Vienna), and the lovely \"Sleeping Venus,\"\r\n      identified by Morelli, in the Dresden Gallery. Among pictures\r\n      in a second and less certain category, may be mentioned the\r\n      \"Concert\" in the Louvre (the \"Venetian Pastoral\" of Rossetti's\r\n      sonnet), another \"Concert\" in the Pitti, the \"Head of a\r\n      Shepherd\" at Hampton Court, and (more doubtfully) No. 1160 in\r\n      this Gallery. The number of reputed Giorgiones is very large.\r\n      His fame has been constant from his own day to ours, and as\r\n      every gallery desired to have a Giorgione, the wish was freely\r\n      gratified by dealers and cataloguers. Modern criticism has\r\n      played havoc among most of these so-called Giorgiones;[124] but\r\n      the Giorgionesque spirit remains--unmistakable and distinct--in\r\n      many works. Such in this Gallery are Nos. 930, 1123, and 1173,\r\n      ascribed by the director to \"the School of Giorgione.\" It is\r\n      a school, as we have seen, of _genre_. It \"employs itself\r\n      mainly with painted idylls, but, in the production of this\r\n      pictorial poetry, exercises a wonderful tact in the selecting\r\n      of such matter as lends itself most readily and entirely to\r\n      pictorial form, to complete expression by drawing and colour.\r\n      For although its productions are painted poems, they belong\r\n      to a sort of poetry which tells itself without an articulated\r\n      story.\" Vasari remarked that it was difficult to give\r\n      Giorgione's representations an explanatory name. As Morelli has\r\n      well pointed out, the genius of Titian was wholly dramatic;\r\n      Giorgione was a lyric poet, who gives us at most dramatic\r\n      lyrics. A picture by Giorgione or in his style \"presents us\r\n      with a kind of profoundly significant and animated instant, a\r\n      mere gesture, a look, a smile perhaps--some brief and wholly\r\n      concrete moment--into which, however, all the motives, all\r\n      the interests and effects of a long history, have condensed\r\n      themselves, and which seem to absorb past and future in an\r\n      intense consciousness of the present. Such ideal instants the\r\n      school of Giorgione selects, with its admirable tact, from\r\n      that feverish, tumultuously coloured life of the old citizens\r\n      of Venice--exquisite pauses in Time, in which, arrested thus,\r\n      we seem to be spectators of all the fulness of existence, and\r\n      which are like some consummate extract or quintessence of\r\n      life.\" Pictures in the Giorgionesque spirit are, as it were,\r\n      \"musical intervals in human existence--filled with people with\r\n      intent faces listening to music, to the sound of water, to time\r\n      as it flies\" (Pater: \"The School of Giorgione,\" _Fortnightly\r\n      Review_, October 1877, reprinted in the third edition of _The\r\n      Renaissance_). The landscapes of Giorgione have the same\r\n      quality of quickened life. \"Most painted landscapes leave\r\n      little power to call up the actual physical sensations of the\r\n      scenes themselves, but Giorgione's never fail to produce this\r\n      effect; they speak directly to the sensations, making the\r\n      beholder feel refreshed and soothed, as if actually reclining\r\n      on the grass in the shade of the trees, with his mind free\r\n      to muse on what delights it most. In so far as poetry may\r\n      be compared to painting, Giorgione's feeling for landscape\r\n      suggests Keats\" (Mary Logan: _Guide to the Italian Pictures at\r\n      Hampton Court_, p. 13).\r\n\r\n      Giorgione's pictures may be described as showing us golden\r\n      moments of a golden age. His life, as told by Vasari and\r\n      Ridolfi, corresponds with this ideal, which also was in exact\r\n      accordance with the spirit of the times. Many readers will\r\n      remember that it is with a mention of Giorgione that Ruskin\r\n      prefaces his noble description of Venice in the days of the\r\n      early Renaissance: \"Born half-way between the mountains and the\r\n      sea--that young George of Castelfranco--of the Brave Castle;\r\n      stout George they called him, George of Georges, so goodly a\r\n      boy he was--Giorgione. Have you ever thought what a world his\r\n      eyes opened on--fair, searching eyes of youth? What a world\r\n      of mighty life, from those mountain roots to the shore; of\r\n      loveliest life, when he went down, yet so young, to the marble\r\n      city, and became himself as a fiery heart to it?\" (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. ix. § 1). He spent his childhood\r\n      at Castelfranco, \"where the last crags of the Venetian Alps\r\n      break down romantically with something of a park-like grace to\r\n      the plain.\" \"Giorgione's ideal of luxuriant pastoral scenery,\r\n      the country of pleasant copses, glades and brooks, amid which\r\n      his personages love to wander or recline with lute and pipe,\r\n      was derived, no doubt, from these natural surroundings of his\r\n      childhood.\" Close by his birthplace is Asolo, whence the word\r\n      _asolare_, \"to disport in the open air; to amuse oneself at\r\n      random\" (see Browning's _Asolando_). Giorgione \"found his way\r\n      early into a circle of notable persons--people of courtesy,\r\n      and became initiated into those differences of personal type,\r\n      manner, and even of dress, which are best understood there.\r\n      Not far from his home lived Catherine of Cornaro, formerly\r\n      Queen of Cyprus, and up in the towers which still remain, Tuzio\r\n      Costanzo, the famous _condottiére_--a picturesque remnant\r\n      of mediæval manners, in a civilisation rapidly changing\"\r\n      (Pater). In Venice Giorgione's gracious bearing and varied\r\n      accomplishments introduced him into congenial company. \"He took\r\n      no small delight,\" says Vasari, \"in love-passages and in the\r\n      sound of the lute, to which he was so cordially devoted, and\r\n      which he practised so constantly, that he played and sang with\r\n      the most exquisite perfection, insomuch that he was for this\r\n      cause frequently invited to musical assemblies and festivals\r\n      by the most distinguished personages.\" \"It happened, about his\r\n      thirty-fourth year, that in one of those parties at which he\r\n      entertained his friends with music, he met a certain lady of\r\n      whom he became greatly enamoured, and 'they rejoiced greatly,'\r\n      says Vasari, 'the one and the other in their love.' And two\r\n      quite different legends concerning it agree in this, that it\r\n      was through this lady he came by his death; Ridolfi relating\r\n      that, being robbed of her by one of his pupils, he died of\r\n      grief at the double treason; Vasari, that she being secretly\r\n      stricken of the plague, and he making his visits to her as\r\n      usual, he took the sickness from her mortally, along with her\r\n      kisses, and so briefly departed\" (Pater).[125]\r\n\r\nThis little panel is a study for the figure of San Liberale, the\r\nwarrior-saint, in the altar-piece by Giorgione at Castelfranco--one of\r\nhis acknowledged masterpieces, and according to Ruskin one of the two\r\nbest pictures in the world.[126] Notice \"the bronzed, burning flesh\"\r\nof the knight--\"the right Giorgione colour on his brow\" characteristic\r\nof a race of seamen (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. v. ch.\r\ni. § 19). This \"original little study in oil, with the delicately\r\ngleaming silver-grey armour is,\" says Mr. Pater, \"one of the greatest\r\ntreasures of the National Gallery, and in it, as in some other knightly\r\npersonages attributed to Giorgione, people have supposed the likeness\r\nof his own presumably gracious presence.\" From a MS. memorandum on the\r\nback of the Castelfranco picture, it appears, however, that the warrior\r\nwas said to represent Gaston de Foix. The only difference between this\r\nstudy and the picture is that in the altar-piece the warrior wears his\r\nhelmet, while in the picture he is bareheaded. On this ground, and\r\nowing to the high finish of our picture, some have argued that it is\r\nnot an original study for the picture, but a later copy from it (see\r\n_e.g._ Richter's _Italian Art in the National Gallery_, p. 86). The\r\nargument does not seem conclusive. Do artists never make elaborate\r\nstudies? and is not an artist as likely to vary his design as a copyist\r\nhis model? Our picture, which was formerly in the collection of\r\nBenjamin West, P.R.A., was bequeathed to the National Gallery by Samuel\r\nRogers.\r\n\r\n\r\n270. \"NOLI ME TANGERE!\"\r\n\r\n  _Titian_ (Venetian: 1477-1576). _See 4._\r\n\r\nA picture of the evensong of nature and of the evening of a life's\r\ntragedy. \"The hues and harmonies of evening\" are upon the distant hills\r\nand plain; and whilst the shadows fall upon the middle slopes, there\r\nfalls too \"the awful shadow of some unseen Power\" upon the repentant\r\nwoman who has been keeping her vigil in the peaceful solitude; at the\r\nsound of her name she has turned from her weeping and fallen forward\r\non her knees towards him whom she now knows to be her master. \"The\r\nimpetuosity with which she has thrown herself on her knees in shown\r\nby the fluttering drapery of her sleeve,[127] which is still buoyed\r\nup by the air; thus with a true painter's art telling the action of\r\nthe previous moment\" (_Quarterly Review_, October 1888). She stretches\r\nout her hand to touch him, but is checked by his words; as Christ, who\r\nis represented with a hoe in his hand because she had first supposed\r\nhim to be the gardener, bids her forbear: \"Touch me not,\" \"noli me\r\ntangere,\" \"for I am not yet ascended to my Father:\" it is not on this\r\nside of the hills that the troubled soul can enter into the peace of\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful picture was bequeathed to the National Gallery by Samuel\r\nRogers. It is usually ascribed to Titian's earlier or \"Giorgionesque\"\r\nperiod. \"The Magdalen is, appropriately enough, of the same type as\r\nthe exquisite golden-blond courtesans--or, if you will, models--who\r\nconstantly appear and re-appear in this period of Venetian art\" (C.\r\nPhillips: _The Earlier Work of Titian_, p. 52).\r\n\r\n\r\n271. \"ECCE HOMO!\"\r\n\r\n  _Guido_ (Eclectic-Bologna: 1575-1642). _See 11._\r\n\r\nFor the subject, see under 15, by Correggio. It was from Correggio that\r\nthe Eclectics borrowed the type of face for this subject--which was\r\na favourite one with them; but notice how much more they dwell on the\r\nphysical pain and horror, how much less on the spiritual beauty, than\r\nCorreggio did.\r\n\r\n\r\n272. AN APOSTLE.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Italian: 16th century).\r\n\r\nFrom a church near Venice. Formerly ascribed to Pordenone.\r\n\r\n\r\n274. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Mantegna_ (Paduan: 1431-1506).\r\n\r\n      Andrea Mantegna, the greatest master of the Paduan School, has\r\n      a commanding name in art history, so much so that many writers\r\n      describe the epoch of painting (from 1450 to 1500 and a little\r\n      onwards), of which he was one of the chief representatives,\r\n      as the _Mantegnesque_ period. \"No painter more remarkable for\r\n      originality than Mantegna ever lived. Whoever has learned to\r\n      relish this great master will never overlook a scrap by him;\r\n      for while his works sometimes show a certain austerity and\r\n      harshness, they have always a force and will which belong\r\n      to no one else\" (Layard). \"Intensity may be said to be the\r\n      characteristic of Mantegna as an artist. Deeply in earnest,\r\n      he swerved from his purpose neither to the right nor to the\r\n      left. In expressing tragic emotion, he sometimes touched a\r\n      realism beyond the limits prescribed by poetic art. So, too,\r\n      he never arrived at an ideal of female beauty. But he could be\r\n      as tender as he was stern; and we forget the homely plainness\r\n      of his Madonnas in the devoted and boding mother or the benign\r\n      protectress. His children are always childlike and without\r\n      self-consciousness. His drawing was remarkably correct. An\r\n      occasional lengthiness in his figures adds to their dignity,\r\n      and never oversteps possible nature. Drapery he treated as a\r\n      means of displaying the figure. This peculiarity he derived\r\n      from an almost too exclusive study of ancient sculpture. Yet so\r\n      thoroughly does it accord with his whole style, that none would\r\n      willingly miss a single fold which the master thought worthy of\r\n      almost infinite care\" (Burton). He was a _tempera_ painter, and\r\n      \"excelled in harmoniously broken tones, but with little attempt\r\n      at those rich and deep effects which by the practice of art his\r\n      later Venetian contemporaries initiated.\" \"He loved allegory\r\n      and symbolism; but with him they clothed a living spirit.\" The\r\n      beauty of classical bas-relief entered deep into his soul and\r\n      ruled his imagination. His classical pictures are \"statuesque\r\n      and stately, but glow with the spirit of revived antiquity\"\r\n      (Symonds). He was equally distinguished as an engraver and a\r\n      painter, and his plates spread his fame and influence widely\r\n      abroad.\r\n\r\n      Mantegna was born at Padua,[128] and according to Vasari, was\r\n      originally, like Giotto, a shepherd boy. Like Giotto, too,\r\n      he early displayed great aptitude for drawing, so much that\r\n      when only ten years old he was adopted by Squarcione as son\r\n      and pupil. Squarcione was an indifferent painter, but must\r\n      have been an able teacher, and it was from him that Mantegna\r\n      imbibed his love of the antique. It was Squarcione's intention\r\n      to make him his heir, but Mantegna married a daughter of\r\n      Jacopo Bellini, Squarcione's rival; \"and when this was told\r\n      to Squarcione he was so much displeased with Andrea that they\r\n      were ever afterwards enemies.\" Of Mantegna's association with\r\n      his brother-in-law, Giovanni Bellini, the pictures numbered 726\r\n      and 1417 in this gallery are an interesting record. Mantegna\r\n      soon obtained recognition. Among the most important of his\r\n      early works are the frescoes of the chapel of St. James and St.\r\n      Christopher in the church of the Eremitani at Padua. Copies of\r\n      some of these may be seen in the Arundel Society's collection.\r\n      Of about the same date is \"The Agony in the Garden,\" No.\r\n      1417. To his early period belong also the \"St. George\" in the\r\n      Venice Academy, and the triptych in the Uffizi. The picture\r\n      now before us, the beautiful \"Madonna della Vittoria,\" and\r\n      the \"Parnassus\" of the Louvre belong to a maturer time. In\r\n      1466 Mantegna went, at the invitation of the Marquis Ludovico\r\n      Gonzaga, to the court of Mantua, and there he remained till his\r\n      death, as painter-in-ordinary at a salary of £30 a year--with\r\n      the exception of two years spent in painting for Pope Innocent\r\n      VIII. at Rome. Many of Mantegna's frescoes at Mantua are now\r\n      obliterated; but some are preserved in the Camera degli Sposi\r\n      in the Ducal Palace, and in spite of restorations, exhibit some\r\n      of the master's characteristics in perfection. For the palace\r\n      of St. Sebastiano at Mantua, he painted in _tempera_ on canvas\r\n      the \"Triumph of Cæsar,\" now at Hampton Court. Although much\r\n      defaced, this large composition still proclaims the genius of\r\n      the master who \"loved to resuscitate the ancient world, and\r\n      render it to the living eye in all its detail, and with all its\r\n      human interest.\" The sketch by Rubens in our Gallery, No. 278,\r\n      was made from a portion of Mantegna's cartoons. In a similar\r\n      style is the master's \"Triumph of Scipio,\" No. 902, completed\r\n      shortly before his death. At Rome (1488-1490) he decorated the\r\n      chapel of the Belvedere, now demolished.\r\n\r\n      Though in the service of princes, Mantegna knew his worth, and\r\n      was wont to say that \"Ludovico might be proud of having in him\r\n      something that no other prince in Italy could boast of.\" He\r\n      liked, too, to live in the grand style of his age. It appears\r\n      that he spent habitually more money than he could afford, and\r\n      after his death his sons had to sell the pictures in his studio\r\n      for the payment of his creditors. Still more was he a child of\r\n      his age--the age of the revival of classical learning--in his\r\n      love for the antique. He spent much of his money in forming\r\n      a collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, and the forced\r\n      sale of its chief ornament, a bust of Faustina, is said to\r\n      have broken his heart. \"He was the friend of students, eagerly\r\n      absorbing the knowledge brought to light by antiquarian\r\n      research; and thus independently of his high value as a\r\n      painter, he embodies for us in art that sincere passion for the\r\n      ancient world which was the dominating intellectual impulse of\r\n      his age.\" With Mantegna, classical antiques were not merely\r\n      the foibles of a collector, but the models of his art. He was\r\n      \"always of opinion,\" says Vasari, \"that good antique statues\r\n      were more perfect, and displayed more beauty in the different\r\n      parts, than is exhibited by nature.\" Of some of his works what\r\n      Vasari adds is no doubt true--that they recall the idea of\r\n      stone rather than of living flesh. But Mantegna studied nature\r\n      closely too; for, as Goethe said of his pictures, \"the study of\r\n      the antique gives form, and nature adds appropriate movement\r\n      and the health of life.\" Mantegna died at Mantua and was\r\n      buried in a chapel of the Church of Sant' Andrea. The expenses\r\n      incurred by him in founding and decorating this family chapel\r\n      had added seriously to his embarrassments. \"Over his grave was\r\n      placed a bronze bust, most noble in modelling and perfect in\r\n      execution. The broad forehead, with its deeply cloven furrows,\r\n      the stern and piercing eyes, the large lips compressed with\r\n      nervous energy, the massive nose, the strength of jaw and\r\n      chin, and the superb clusters of the hair escaping from a\r\n      laurel-wreath upon the royal head, are such as realise for us\r\n      our notion of a Roman in the days of the republic. Mantegna's\r\n      own genius has inspired this masterpiece, which tradition\r\n      assigns to the medallist Sperando Maglioli. Whoever wrought it\r\n      must have felt the incubation of the mighty painter's spirit,\r\n      and have striven to express in bronze the character of his\r\n      uncompromising art\" (Symonds: _The Renaissance in Italy_,\r\n      iii. 203). A plaster cast from this bust hangs on one of the\r\n      staircases in our Gallery. Mantegna's second son, Francesco,\r\n      who in his father's later years had assisted in his studio,\r\n      afterwards practised independently. See Nos. 639, 1106, 1381.\r\n\r\n\"One of the choicest pictures in the National Gallery,\" exquisite\r\nalike in sentiment, in drawing, and in purity of colour. \"Being in an\r\nadmirable state of preservation, it enables us to become acquainted\r\nwith all the characteristics of Mantegna's style, and above all to\r\nenjoy the refinement in his rendering of the human forms, the accuracy\r\nin his drawing, the conscientiousness in the rendering of the smallest\r\ndetails\" (_Richter_). For the latter point notice especially the\r\nherbage in the foreground. Mantegna, says Mr. Ruskin, is \"the greatest\r\nleaf-painter of Lombardy,\" and the \"exquisite outlines\" here show\r\n\"the symmetry and precision of his design\" (_Catalogue of Educational\r\nSeries_, p. 52). The draperies also are \"of extraordinary beauty\r\nin design and colour. The rose-coloured dress of the Virgin is most\r\ndelicately heightened with gold, and the draperies of the two saints\r\nare of materials shot with changing colours of exquisite harmonies\"\r\n(_Poynter_). Very sweet is the expression of mingled humility and\r\ntenderness in the mother of the Divine Child. On her right stands St.\r\nJohn the Baptist, the great preacher of repentance; on her left Mary\r\nMagdalen, the woman who repented. The Baptist bears a cross and on the\r\nscroll attached to it are written the words (in Latin), \"Behold the\r\nLamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\" The Magdalen\r\ncarries the vase of ointment--the symbol at once of her conversion\r\nand her love (\"She brought an alabaster box of ointment, and began\r\nto wash his feet with tears.... And he said unto her, Thy sins are\r\nforgiven\"). \"Mantegna combines with the most inexhaustible imagination\r\nand invention and power, which include the whole range of art, from the\r\nmost playful fantasy to the profoundest and most passionate tragedy, a\r\nskill of workmanship so minutely and marvellously delicate as to defy\r\nimitation. Look at the refinement with which the drapery is drawn, the\r\nwonderful delicacy of handling with which the gold-lights are laid on,\r\nthe beautiful and loving spirit which has presided over the execution\r\nof the foliage in the background, and indeed of every detail in the\r\npicture, and you will begin to have an understanding of what I mean by\r\nworkmanship as such, and how an artist proceeds whose hand has been\r\nthoroughly trained, and who is truly in love with his art\" (Poynter's\r\n_Lectures on Art_, p. 127).\r\n\r\n\r\n275. VIRGIN AND CHILD, ST. JOHN AND AN ANGEL.\r\n\r\n  _Sandro Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510). _See 1034._\r\n\r\nA beautiful and characteristic work.[129] \"At first glance you may\r\nthink the picture a mere piece of affectation. Well--yes, Botticelli\r\nis affected in the way that all men of his century necessarily were.\r\nMuch euphuism, much studied grace of manner, much formal assertion\r\nof scholarship, mingling with his force of imagination. And he likes\r\ntwisting the fingers of hands about\"--just as he likes also dancing\r\nmotion and waved drapery (see 1034) (_Mornings in Florence_, iii. 59).\r\nThe picture is characteristic also of two faculties which Botticelli\r\nacquired from his early training as a goldsmith: first, his use of gold\r\nas a means of enriching the light (as here in the Madonna's hair);\r\nand, secondly, the \"incomparable invention and delicacy\" with which he\r\ntreated all accessory details and ornaments (as here in the scarves and\r\ndresses). But chiefly is the picture characteristic of his \"sentiment\r\nof ineffable melancholy, of which it is hard to penetrate the sense,\r\nand impossible to escape the spell.\" It may help one in understanding\r\nthe spirit of such pictures to remember that in Botticelli there met\r\nin perfect poise the tenderness of Christian feeling with the grace\r\nof the classical Renaissance. He was \"a Greek reanimate. The first\r\nGreeks were distinguished from the barbarians by their simple humanity;\r\nthe second Greeks--these Florentine Greeks reanimate--are human more\r\nstrongly, more deeply, leaping from the Byzantine death at the call of\r\nChrist, 'Loose him, and let him go.' And there is upon them at once\r\nthe joy of resurrection and the solemnity of the grave\"[130] (_Ariadne\r\nFlorentina_, § 161; and _Fors Clavigera_, 1872, xxii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n276. TWO APOSTLES.\r\n\r\n  School of _Giotto_. _See under 568._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n    Here's Giotto with his Saints a-praising God,\r\n    That set us praising.\r\n\r\n  BROWNING.\r\n\r\nThese solemn heads seem to breathe the very spirit of the master; but\r\nthe history of the painting forbids the supposition that we have here\r\nthe handiwork, or even the direct influence of Giotto. It is a fragment\r\nfrom one of the wall-paintings in the chapel of St. John the Baptist in\r\nthe church of S. Maria del Carmine at Florence. The frescoes were not\r\nexecuted till 1350, some years after the death of Giotto. The subject\r\nof the composition to which our fragment belongs was the burial of\r\nthe Baptist. The history of these frescoes is typical of that of many\r\na vicissitude, and recalls the idea suggested in one of Browning's\r\n_Dramatic Lyrics_, in which the soul of the painter watches the gradual\r\ndecay and dispersal of his life's work:--\r\n\r\n    Wherever a fresco peals and drops,\r\n      Wherever an outline weakens and wanes\r\n    Till the latest life in the painting stops,\r\n      Stands One whom each fainter pulse-tick pains:\r\n    One, wishful each scrap should clutch the brick,\r\n      Each tinge, not wholly escape the plaster,\r\n    --A lion who dies of an ass's kick,\r\n      The wronged great soul of an ancient Master.\r\n\r\nThis and two portions from other paintings of the series, now in the\r\ninstitution at Liverpool, were saved from the fire which destroyed\r\nthis chapel in 1771, and became the property of Mr. Thomas Patch, the\r\nengraver. They were brought to England by Mr. Townley. This fragment\r\nwas subsequently in the collection of the Right Hon. C. Greville, from\r\nwhom it passed into the possession of Mr. Rogers, and at the sale of\r\nhis pictures in 1856 was purchased for the National Gallery. Some other\r\nfragments are preserved in the Cappella dell' Ammannati, in the Campo\r\nSanto at Pisa, and one is in the town gallery at Pavia.\r\n\r\n\r\n277. THE GOOD SAMARITAN.\r\n\r\n  _Bassano_ (Venetian: 1510-1592). _See 173._\r\n\r\nThe wounded Jew, who had fallen among thieves, is beneath the shadow of\r\na great rock. The Levite is behind, engaged in sanctimonious prayer.\r\nThe good Samaritan is busy in good works. He has brought out his\r\nflask and is raising the Jew to place him on his mule. The picture\r\nis of additional interest as having been a favourite with Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds, to whom it once belonged, and who is said to have kept it\r\nalways in his studio. It was afterwards in the collection of Samuel\r\nRogers.\r\n\r\n\r\n278. THE TRIUMPH OF JULIUS CÆSAR.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See 38._\r\n\r\nOne of the fruits of Rubens's visit to Italy. This picture was in\r\nRubens's possession at his death, and is described in the inventory as\r\n\"Three cloathes pasted upon bord, beinge the Triumph of Julius Cæsar,\r\nafter Andrew Mantegna, not full made.\" Mantegna's procession (somewhat\r\nsimilar to the Triumph of Scipio, No. 902) was painted for the Duke of\r\nMantua, and is now at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\nAny one who cares to see by a single illustration what \"classic\r\npurity of style\" means, should compare Mantegna's original with this\r\ntranscript by Rubens. \"The Flemish painter strives to add richness to\r\nthe scene by Bacchanalian riot and the sensuality of imperial Rome.\r\nHis elephants twist their trunks, and trumpet to the din of cymbals;\r\nnegroes feed the flaming candelabra with scattered frankincense; the\r\nwhite oxen of Clitumnus are loaded with gaudy flowers, and the dancing\r\nmaidens are dishevelled Mænads. But the rhythmic procession of\r\nMantegna, modulated to the sound of flutes and soft recorders, carries\r\nour imagination back to the best days and strength of Rome. His priests\r\nand generals, captives and choric women, are as little Greek as they\r\nare modern. In them awakes to a new life the spirit-quelling energy\r\nof the Republic. The painter's severe taste keeps out of sight the\r\ninsolence and orgies of the Empire; he conceives Rome as Shakespeare\r\ndid in _Coriolanus_\"[131] (Symonds's _Renaissance_, iii. 200).\r\n\r\n\r\n279. THE HORRORS OF WAR.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See 38._\r\n\r\n\"Mars, leaving the temple of Janus[132] open, is held back by Venus,\r\nwhile Europe bewails the inevitable miseries of war; but he is drawn on\r\nby the Fury Alecto, who is preceded by Plague and Famine; the figure\r\non the ground with the broken lute represents Concord overthrown. Mars\r\nand the two female figures behind him are said to be the portraits of\r\nRubens and his two wives\" (Official Catalogue).\r\n\r\nThis is a sketch of the large picture painted by Rubens in 1637 for\r\nhis friend Sustermans, and now in the Pitti palace at Genoa. This\r\nsketch, with the preceding one, was in the collection of Mr. Rogers,\r\nwhere Ruskin saw it, as recorded in the following extract from his\r\nautobiography, in which he describes \"a lesson given to me by George\r\nRichmond at one of Mr. Rogers's breakfasts (the old man used to ask\r\nme, finding me always reverent to him, joyful in his pictures, and\r\nsometimes amusing, as an object of curiosity to his guests), date\r\nuncertain, but probably in 1842\":--\r\n\r\n      Until that year, Rubens had remained the type of colour power\r\n      to me, and Titian's flesh tints of little worth! But that\r\n      morning, as I was getting talkative over the wild Rubens's\r\n      sketch (War or Discord, or Victory or the Furies, I forget\r\n      what), Richmond said, pointing to the Veronese beneath it,\r\n      \"Why are you not looking at this--so much greater in manner?\"\r\n      \"Greater--how?\" I asked, in surprise; \"it seems to me quite\r\n      tame beside the Rubens.\" \"That may be,\" said Richmond, \"but the\r\n      Veronese is true, the other wildly conventional.\" \"In what way\r\n      true?\" I asked, still not understanding. \"Well,\" said Richmond,\r\n      \"compare the pure shadows on the flesh in Veronese, and its\r\n      clear edge, with Rubens's ochre and vermilion, and outline of\r\n      asphalt\" (_Praeterita_, ii. 181).\r\n\r\n\r\n280. THE MADONNA OF THE POMEGRANATE.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_ (Venetian: 1426-1516). _See 189._\r\n\r\nA prophetic sense of the Saviour's sufferings is signified by the\r\nsymbol of the pomegranate--\r\n\r\n        Pomegranate, which, if cut deep down the middle,\r\n    Shows a heart within blood-tinctured, of a veined humanity.\r\n\r\n  MRS. BROWNING: _Lady Geraldine's Courtship_.\r\n\r\n    Years pass and change; mother and child remain.\r\n      Mother so proudly sad, so sadly wise,\r\n      With perfect face and wonderful calm eyes,\r\n    Full of a mute expectancy of pain:\r\n    Child of whose love the mother seems so fain,\r\n      Looking far off, as if in other skies\r\n      He saw the hill of crucifixion rise,\r\n    And knew the horror, and would not refrain.\r\n\r\n  _Love in Idleness_ (1883).\r\n\r\nThis picture, which is signed by the painter, probably dates from\r\n1485-88.\r\n\r\n\r\n281. ST. JEROME READING.\r\n\r\n  _Marco Basaiti_ (Venetian: painted 1500-1521).\r\n\r\n      Basaiti--born in Friuli; according to some writers, of Greek\r\n      parents--was assistant to Alvise Vivarini. He was one of the\r\n      early Venetian painters in oils. His works when well preserved\r\n      are (says Sir F. Burton) brilliant in colour, and display\r\n      great ability in the general management of the accessories,\r\n      especially in the landscape backgrounds, which, according to\r\n      Zanetti, he contrived to unite with his figures more skilfully\r\n      than his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe scenery, says Gilbert (_Cadore_, p. 42), is that of Serravalle\r\nin Titian's country--Serravalle, \"the true gate of the hills,\" with\r\nwalls and towers rising steeply on the hill-side. The way in which\r\nthe old masters thus consigned their saints and anchorites to\r\nthe hill-country is very typical of the mediæval view of\r\nlandscape. \"The idea of retirement from the world for the sake of\r\nself-mortification ... gave to all mountain solitude at once a sanctity\r\nand a terror, in the mediæval mind, which were altogether different\r\nfrom anything that it had possessed in the un-Christian periods....\r\nJust in so much as it appeared necessary for the noblest men to retire\r\nto the hill-recesses before their missions could be accomplished,\r\nor their spirit perfected, in so far did the daily world seem by\r\ncomparison to be pronounced profane and dangerous; and to those who\r\nloved that world and its work, the mountains were thus voiceful with\r\nperpetual rebuke.... And thousands of hearts, which might otherwise\r\nhave felt that there was loveliness in the wild landscape, shrank from\r\nit in dread, because they knew that the monk retired to it for penance,\r\nand the hermit for contemplation\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv.\r\nch. xiv. § 10).\r\n\r\n\r\n282. THE GLORIFICATION OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Bertucci_ (Umbrian: 16th Century).\r\n\r\n      Formerly ascribed in the Official Catalogue to Lo Spagna (for\r\n      whom see under 1032); by other critics attributed to Giovanni\r\n      Battista of Faenza, called Bertucci (the monkey), an artist\r\n      who borrowed both from the Umbrian School and from Lorenzo\r\n      Costa. The similarity between this picture and No. 629, by the\r\n      latter artist, especially in the playing angels at the foot of\r\n      the throne, is remarkable (see Richter's _Italian Art in the\r\n      National Gallery_, p. 52). Works by Bertucci are to be seen in\r\n      the picture gallery of Faenza.\r\n\r\nThe little angels are very pretty. Notice the three peering out from\r\nunder the Virgin's robe. On the marble platform below one angel plays\r\na white-headed pipe; the other, a six-stringed rebec, which is very\r\naccurately represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n283. VIRGIN AND CHILD ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n  _Benozzo Gozzoli_ (Florentine: 1420-1498).\r\n\r\n      Benozzo Gozzoli was the favourite pupil of the \"angelical\r\n      painter,\" Fra Angelico. From him Benozzo borrowed the devotion\r\n      in his pictures, the bent of his own mind being altogether\r\n      different. It must be remembered that \"in nearly all the great\r\n      periods of art the choice of subject has not been left to the\r\n      painter; ... and his own personal feelings are ascertainable\r\n      only by watching, in the themes assigned to him, what are\r\n      the points in which he seems to take most pleasure. Thus in\r\n      the prolonged ranges of varied subjects with which Benozzo\r\n      Gozzoli decorated the cloisters of Pisa, it is easy to see\r\n      that love of simple domestic incident, sweet landscape, and\r\n      glittering ornament, prevails slightly over the solemn elements\r\n      of religious feeling, which, nevertheless, the spirit of the\r\n      age instilled into him in such measure as to form a very lovely\r\n      and noble mind, though still one of the second order\" (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. iii. § 8). The earlier works\r\n      of Benozzo are entirely in Fra Angelico's manner. His later\r\n      style (of which an example may be seen in No. 591) presents\r\n      the greatest contrast to that master; for Benozzo is \"the\r\n      first of all the Florentine painters who seem to have been\r\n      smitten with the beauty of the natural world and its various\r\n      appearances. His later pictures overflow with the delighted\r\n      sense of this beauty. He was the first to create rich landscape\r\n      backgrounds, with cities, villas, and trees, rivers, and\r\n      richly-cultivated valleys, bold rocks and hills. He displays\r\n      the richest fancy for architectural forms,--open porticoes,\r\n      elegant arcades, and balconies. In the representation of the\r\n      human figure, we find gaiety and whim, feeling and dignity, in\r\n      the happiest combination\" (Layard). Like other painters of the\r\n      time Benozzo began his career as a worker in metal, and his\r\n      name is found amongst the artificers who assisted Ghiberti in\r\n      making the celebrated gates for the Baptistery at Florence.\r\n      He next entered the school of Fra Angelico, accompanying his\r\n      master to Rome and Orvieto. In 1459 he was employed to decorate\r\n      the walls of the small chapel in the Medici, now Riccardi\r\n      Palace, and here he first gave rein to his own fancies. Copies\r\n      from these frescoes are included in the Arundel Society's\r\n      collection, as well as from those in the church of S. Agostino\r\n      at S. Gimignano, where Benozzo was next employed. The chief\r\n      work of his life was, however, the painting of the Campo Santo\r\n      at Pisa. This occupied him from 1469-1485. Twenty-one of the\r\n      frescoes were by his own hand. They are much injured; for\r\n      \"when any dignitary of Pisa was to be buried, they peeled off\r\n      some Benozzo Gozzoli and put up a nice new tablet to the new\r\n      defunct\" (_Praeterita_, vol. ii. ch. vi., where Ruskin gives\r\n      a charming account of happy days spent in copying Benozzo's\r\n      work). These frescoes are remarkable for their wealth of fancy\r\n      and picturesque detail. The Pisans themselves were so well\r\n      pleased that they presented the painter in 1478 with a tomb,\r\n      that his body might repose amidst the great works of his life.\r\n      He died at Pisa twenty years later.\r\n\r\nThis was a picture painted very much to order. The figure of the Virgin\r\nwas specially directed--so it appears from the original contract,\r\ndated 1461, still in existence--to be made similar in mode, form, and\r\nornaments to one by Fra Angelico, now in the Florentine Academy, and\r\nit was also stipulated that \"the said Benozzo shall at his own cost\r\ndiligently gild the said panel throughout, both as regards figures and\r\nornaments.\" The prices paid for such commissions in those days may be\r\njudged from the fact that in the case of his great frescoes at Pisa,\r\nBenozzo contracted to paint three a year for 10 ducats each (= say\r\n£100). As for Benozzo's own personal feelings, it is easy to see with\r\nwhat pleasure he put in the pretty flowers in the foreground for St.\r\nFrancis, and the sweet-faced angels behind the throne, and with what\r\ngusto he shot the gold in their draperies. The figure on our extreme\r\nleft is St. Zenobius. His embroidered cope is very rich. The details of\r\nneedlework in the picture will well repay careful study. Compared with\r\nall this, the kneeling St. Jerome and St. Francis and the other saints\r\nappear somewhat perfunctory. Notice, too, the bright goldfinches on the\r\nalabaster steps, introduced, we may suppose, in honour of\r\n\r\n    Sweet St. Francis of Assisi, would that he were here again!\r\n    He that in his Catholic wholeness used to call the very flowers\r\n    Sisters, brothers--and the beasts--whose pains are hardly less\r\n      than ours!\r\n\r\n\r\n284. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Bartolommeo Vivarini_ (Venetian: painted 1450-1499).\r\n\r\n      Bartolommeo Vivarini of Murano was the younger brother of\r\n      Antonio (see 768), with whom he began to work in partnership in\r\n      1450--as is shown by the inscription on the great altar-piece\r\n      by the two brothers, now in the Pinacoteca of Bologna.\r\n      Bartolommeo appears to have studied at Padua, and the influence\r\n      of Squarcione is manifest in the painter's striving after\r\n      correctness of form. \"The ornate character of his altar-pieces,\r\n      with gold heightening, garlands of fruit and flowers and\r\n      fluttering fillets, is also borrowed from the Paduans, and\r\n      lends festal pomp and solemnity to the whole.\"\r\n\r\nOf Bartolommeo Vivarini it is recorded that he painted (in 1473) the\r\nfirst oil picture that was exhibited in Venice. This one, however, is\r\nin tempera. \"The figures in Bartolommeo's pictures are still hard in\r\noutline,--thin (except the Madonna's throat, which always in Venice, is\r\nstrong as a pillar), and much marked in sinew and bone (studied from\r\nlife, mind you, not by dissection); exquisitely delicate and careful\r\nin pure colour;--in character portraits of holy men and women, such\r\nas then were. There is no idealism here whatever. Monks and nuns had\r\nindeed faces and mien like these saints, when they desired to have the\r\nsaints painted for them\" (_Guide to the Venetian Academy_, p. 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n285. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Morone_ (Veronese: 1473-1529).\r\n\r\n      Francesco is one of the best masters in the earlier style of\r\n      the Veronese School. He was the son of Domenico Morone (1211),\r\n      the friend and fellow-worker of Girolamo dai Libri (748) and\r\n      the master of Morando (735). His works are rarely to be seen\r\n      out of Verona, but the present picture is characteristic. At\r\n      Verona, his best work in fresco is to be seen in the decoration\r\n      of the sacristry of S. Maria in Organo, described by Vasari.\r\n      Among his altar-pieces, one in the same church and another\r\n      in S. Bernardino are specially noteworthy. \"There is,\" says\r\n      Sir F. Burton, \"something peculiarly winning in the type\r\n      chosen for the Madonna by this painter. The small, round,\r\n      delicately-featured head, slightly thrown back, so that the\r\n      eyes are cast down towards the worshipper, conveys a mingled\r\n      impression of sweetness and dignity. The finish of his easel\r\n      pictures is remarkable; the eye is delighted by the intricate\r\n      variegation of costly stuffs, where numerous tints broken\r\n      together resemble what nature has wrought on the wings of some\r\n      moths and butterflies. Such broken surfaces give additional\r\n      value to the masses of whole colour where these more sparingly\r\n      appear.\" \"That the artist himself was of a harmless, lovable\r\n      nature is evident from his will which we still possess, and\r\n      Vasari's judgment is to the same effect when he calls him 'so\r\n      good a man, so religious and so orderly that no word which\r\n      was not a praiseworthy one was ever known to proceed from his\r\n      mouth'\" (Richter). Vasari adds that he was \"buried in the\r\n      church of San Domenico beside his father, and was borne to his\r\n      grave clothed as he had desired to be, in the vestments of a\r\n      monk of San Francesco.\"\r\n\r\n\"A youthful production, in which glowing colour, delicately balanced,\r\nis combined with fine drawing and powerful modelling. Characteristic\r\nare the regular oval of the Madonna's head and the look of simplicity\r\nand charm which breathes in the features\" (Dr. Richter in _Art\r\nJournal_, Feb. 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n286. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Tacconi_ (Cremonese: painted 1464-1490).\r\n\r\n      The only signed picture by this painter still in existence. He\r\n      was a native of Cremona and worked there: he and his brother\r\n      pleased the Cremonese so much by painting in the Town Hall that\r\n      the artists were given an exemption from taxes. But he may\r\n      be classed as a Venetian, for he was an imitator of Giovanni\r\n      Bellini. This picture at once recalls Bellini's No. 280, and is\r\n      in fact a copy of a Madonna by that painter in the Chiesa degli\r\n      Scalzi at Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n287. LUDOVICO MARTINENGO.\r\n\r\n  _Bartolommeo Veneziano_ (painted 1505-1530).\r\n\r\n      The Martinengo family seems to have patronised this painter,\r\n      as the Senator Count Martinengo, of Venice, possesses as\r\n      an heirloom a small picture by the master which is signed\r\n      \"Bartolommeo mezzo Veneziano e mezzo Cremonese.\" The present\r\n      picture (dated 1530) is signed \"Bartolom. Venetus,\" so that he\r\n      was perhaps a Cremonese by birth and a Venetian by artistic\r\n      training, being probably a pupil of Giovanni Bellini (see\r\n      Morelli's _Italian Works in German Galleries_, p. 138).\r\n\r\nA portrait of a young man, at the age of twenty-six (as the inscription\r\ntells us), in the costume of the Campagnia della Calza (the guild of\r\nthe stocking).\r\n\r\n\r\n288. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD, MICHAEL AND RAPHAEL.\r\n\r\n  _Pietro Perugino_[133] (Umbrian: 1446-1523).\r\n\r\n      Pietro Vannucci, a native of Castello della Pieve, was\r\n      called Perugino, from the town of which he afterwards became\r\n      a citizen. His earliest master was probably Fiorenzo di\r\n      Lorenzo, and he is known to have also worked under Piero\r\n      della Francesca. Afterwards he went to Florence, where,\r\n      it is said, he studied with Leonardo da Vinci under the\r\n      sculptor Verrocchio. There is, however, no trace of any such\r\n      discipleship in his works, which, on the contrary, show an\r\n      untouched development of native Umbrian art, so that Perugino\r\n      becomes the typical representative of what Ruskin calls the\r\n      \"purist ideal.\" It is probable that his first visit to Florence\r\n      was not paid till he was already established in independent\r\n      practice. \"He there remained,\" says Vasari, \"for many months\r\n      without even a bed to lie on, and miserably took his sleep\r\n      upon a chest; but, turning night into day, and labouring\r\n      without intermission, he devoted himself most fervently to\r\n      the study of his profession.\" And in time he became himself a\r\n      famous master, with Raphael for his pupil, and \"he attained\r\n      to such a height of reputation that his works were dispersed,\r\n      not only through Florence and all over Italy, but in France,\r\n      Spain, and other countries.\" He was himself too of a roving\r\n      disposition, and he multiplied his engagements beyond his\r\n      power of fulfilling them. In 1475 he received his first public\r\n      commission at Perugia, but the frescoes then painted for the\r\n      Palazzo Communale have perished. In 1480 he was employed by\r\n      the Pope Sixtus IV., together with Signorelli and Botticelli,\r\n      to cover the walls of the Sixtine Chapel with frescoes. Of the\r\n      four allotted to Perugino (which occupied him in part for six\r\n      years) three were afterwards destroyed to make room for Michael\r\n      Angelo's \"Last Judgment\"; the fourth, the \"Delivery of the\r\n      Keys to St. Peter,\" remains. Perugino's subsequent movements\r\n      are not easy to follow,[134] and we can only here allude to\r\n      some of his most famous works. In 1494 he was at Venice, and\r\n      in the same year painted his very beautiful altar-piece in\r\n      S. Agostino at Cremona. In 1495 he contracted to paint for\r\n      the monks of Cassino the noble Assumption now at Lyons. In\r\n      1496 he painted for the Cathedral of Perugia, the famous\r\n      \"Sposalizio,\" now at Caen. To the same period in his career\r\n      belongs the picture now before us, painted for the Certosa\r\n      of Pavia. Down to about 1493, Perugino's easel pictures were\r\n      executed in _tempera_ (see 181); he then adopted the new oil\r\n      medium, which he used to such splendid effect in richness of\r\n      colour. In 1499 he was at Perugia, engaged upon the beautiful\r\n      frescoes in the Hall of the Bankers (Collegio del Cambio). He\r\n      was afterwards in Florence, but in 1505 returned to Perugia,\r\n      where in 1507 he painted the altar-piece, No. 1075 in our\r\n      gallery. In his later years he erected a large studio in which\r\n      several scholars were employed to execute commissions from\r\n      his designs, and the works of this period show considerable\r\n      inequality of execution, as well as repetition of design,\r\n      and some falling off in richness of colouring. According to\r\n      Vasari's gossip Perugino was very careful of his money--as one\r\n      who had seen such hard times might well be; would only paint\r\n      for cash down, and on all his wanderings carried his money box\r\n      with him. \"When it is fair weather,\" he used to say, \"a man\r\n      must build his house, that he may be under shelter when he most\r\n      needs it.\" It was not, however, till middle life that he did\r\n      literally build himself a house. At the same time he married a\r\n      very beautiful girl, and is said to have had so much pleasure\r\n      in seeing her wear becoming head-dresses that he would spend\r\n      hours together in arranging that part of her toilet with his\r\n      own hands. There is a tradition that she was the model for the\r\n      angel who accompanies Tobias in our picture. The master was\r\n      still painting in his 77th year, and was engaged on a fresco\r\n      at Frontignano (now in this gallery, No. 1441), when he was\r\n      carried off by the plague. The most famous of his pupils was\r\n      Raphael; among the rest, the most accomplished were Giovanni lo\r\n      Spagna (1032), and Giannicola Manni (1194).\r\n\r\n      Perugino's work is well represented in the National Gallery,\r\n      and its several characteristics are pointed out under the\r\n      pictures themselves (_cf._ especially 181 and 1075). He was,\r\n      as we have said, the typical representative of the purist\r\n      ideal. His technical supremacy set the seal of perfection upon\r\n      pietistic art, and the masterpiece before us is unique for\r\n      its combination of warmth of colour, with the expression of\r\n      religious fervour. \"What this artist seems to have aimed at,\r\n      was to create for the soul, amid the pomps and passions of this\r\n      world, a resting-place of contemplation tenanted by saintly and\r\n      seraphic beings.\" Of his life as reflected in his work, Ruskin\r\n      gives this summary: \"A sound craftsman and workman to the very\r\n      heart's core. A noble, gracious, and quiet labourer from youth\r\n      to death,--never weary, never impatient, never untender, never\r\n      untrue. Not Tintoret in power, not Raphael in flexibility,\r\n      not Holbein in veracity, not Luini in love,--their gathered\r\n      gifts he has, in balanced and fruitful measure, fit to be the\r\n      guide, and impulse, and father of all\" (_Ariadne Florentina_,\r\n      § 72). But Perugino, like the times in which he lived,\r\n      presents a study in contradictions. This idealist painted his\r\n      portrait in the Sala del Cambio; it is an unsurpassed piece of\r\n      realism, and the hard, unsympathetic features do not belie,\r\n      but rather win credence for Vasari's tales about his sordid\r\n      soul. He never deviated in his art from the pietistic path he\r\n      had chosen; but according to Vasari[135] (whose statements\r\n      on this point are supported by some other evidence), he was\r\n      himself an unbeliever, and on his death-bed rejected the last\r\n      sacraments. In his art he is essentially a quietist. He is not\r\n      successful when he represents action or movement. His ideal is\r\n      of quiet rapture, and sacred peace. But the criminal records\r\n      of Florence prove that he was not over-scrupulous to keep\r\n      his hands from violence, and in the civil courts he pursued\r\n      Michael Angelo with equal indiscretion and ill-success for\r\n      defamation of character. His pictures reflect the landscape,\r\n      but not the fortunes, of his native country: that the quietism\r\n      of Perugino \"should have been fashionable in Perugia, while\r\n      the Baglioni were tearing each other to pieces, and the troops\r\n      of the Vitelli and the Borgia were trampling upon Umbria, is\r\n      one of the most striking paradoxes of an age rich in dramatic\r\n      contradictions\" (Symonds's _Renaissance_, iii. 218).\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable pictures in the Gallery alike for its own\r\nbeauty and for its interest in the history of art. For Perugino\r\nis the final representative of the old superstitious art, just as\r\nMichael Angelo and Raphael (in his later manners) were the first\r\nrepresentatives of the modern scientific and anatomical art; the\r\nepithet bestowed on Perugino by Michael Angelo, _goffo nell' arte_\r\n(dunce, or blockhead, in art), shows how trenchant the separation\r\nis between these two forms of artists. One may notice, then, in\r\nthis picture as a perfect example of the earlier art: First, that\r\neverything in it is dainty and delightful, and all that it attempts\r\nis accomplished. Michael Angelo, dashing off his impetuous thoughts,\r\nleft much of his work half done (see 790); Perugino worked steadily in\r\nthe old ways and indeed repeated ideas with so little reflection that,\r\naccording to Vasari, he was blamed for doing the same thing over and\r\nover again. But everything is finished, even to the gilding of single\r\nhairs. Notice also the beautiful painting of the fish.[136] Secondly,\r\nit is a work in the school of colour, as distinguished from the school\r\nof light and shade. \"Clear, calm, placid, perpetual vision, far and\r\nnear; endless perspicuity of space, unfatigued veracity of eternal\r\nlight, perfectly accurate delineation of every leaf on the trees and\r\nevery flower in the fields\" (notice especially in the foreground the\r\n\"blue flower fit for paradise\" of the central compartment). \"There\r\nis no darkness, no wrong. Every colour is lovely, and every space is\r\nlight. The world, the universe, is divine; all sadness is a part of\r\nharmony; and all gloom a part of peace.\" In connection with the lovely\r\nblue in the picture (which was painted in 1494-98 for the Certosa of\r\nPavia), one may remember the story told of an earlier picture, how\r\nthe prior of the convent for which Perugino was painting doled out to\r\nhim the costly colour of ultramarine, and how Perugino, by constantly\r\nwashing his brushes, obtained a surreptitious hoard of the colour,\r\nwhich he ultimately restored to shame the prior for his suspicions.\r\nThirdly, in its rendering of landscape, the picture is characteristic\r\nof the \"purism\" of older art as compared with the later \"naturalism.\"\r\n\"The religious painters impress on their landscape perfect symmetry\r\nand order, such as may seem, consistent with the spiritual nature\r\nthey would represent. The trees grow straight, equally branched on\r\neach side, and of slight and feathery frame. The mountains stand\r\nup unscathed; the waters are always waveless, the skies always\r\ncalm.\"[137] Notice also that the sentiment of the whole picture is\r\nlike its landscape; there is no striving, nor crying, no convulsive\r\naction; it is all one \"pure passage of intense feeling and heavenly\r\nlight, holy and undefiled, glorious with the changeless passion of\r\neternity--sanctified with shadeless peace.\" Notice lastly, how in this,\r\nas in many sacred compositions, \"a living symmetry, the balance of\r\nharmonious opposites, is one of the profoundest sources of their power.\r\nThe Madonna of Perugino in the National Gallery, with the angel Michael\r\non one side and Raphael on the other, is as beautiful an example as\r\nyou can have\" (_Elements of Drawing_, p. 258). The subject of the\r\nright-hand compartment is Raphael and Tobias (for which see 781); that\r\nof the left-hand one is \"the orderer of Christian warfare, Michael the\r\nArchangel; not Milton's 'with hostile brow and visage all inflamed';\r\nnot even Milton's in kingly treading of the hills of Paradise; not\r\nRaphael's with expanded wings and brandished spear; but Perugino's\r\nwith his triple crest of traceless plume unshaken in heaven, his hand\r\nfallen on his crossleted sword, the truth-girdle binding his undinted\r\narmour; God has put his power upon him, resistless radiance is on his\r\nlimbs; no lines are there of earthly strength, no trace on the divine\r\nfeatures of earthly anger; trustful and thoughtful, fearless, but full\r\nof love, incapable except of the repose of eternal conquest, vessel and\r\ninstrument of Omnipotence, filled like a cloud with the victor light,\r\nthe dust of principalities and powers beneath his feet, the murmur of\r\nhell against him heard by his spiritual ear like the winding of a shell\r\non the far-off sea-shore.\" He is thus armed as the orderer of Christian\r\nwarfare against evil; in his other character, as lord of souls, he has\r\nthe scales which hang on a tree by his side (_Ariadne Florentina_, pp.\r\n40, 265, 266; _On the Old Road_, i. § 529; _Modern Painters_, vol. ii.\r\npt. iii. sec. i. ch. x. § 4; sec. ii. ch. v. § 20.)\r\n\r\n\r\n289. \"THE NIGHT WATCH.\"\r\n\r\n  _Gerrit Lundens_ (Dutch: 1622-1677).\r\n\r\nThis is a copy, on a greatly reduced scale, of the famous picture by\r\nRembrandt (painted in 1642), now in the State-Museum at Amsterdam. It\r\nis of interest as showing the pristine condition of its great original,\r\nwhich in the earlier part of the eighteenth century was maltreated on\r\nall four sides, and thereby shorn of some of its figures in order to\r\nsuit the dimensions of a room to which it was at that time removed. The\r\npicture had so darkened by time or neglect, that it came to be called\r\n\"The Night Watch.\" The real subject is the march out of a company of\r\nthe Amsterdam Musketeers from their Headquarters' Hall, under the\r\ncommand of their captain, Frans Banning Cocq, who is seen advancing\r\nin the centre and giving orders to his lieutenant. The principal\r\nfigures are all portraits, and the names were written on the back of\r\nthe picture. Our copy was painted for Cocq himself, and after many\r\nvicissitudes reached England at the beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n290. A MAN'S PORTRAIT (dated 1432).\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Eyck_ (Early Flemish: about 1390-1440). _See 186._\r\n\r\nA portrait of a friend of the artist, for it is inscribed \"Leal\r\nSouvenir\"--and a true recollection it obviously is, and was the more\r\nacceptable, one likes to think, for being so. \"It is not the untrue\r\nimaginary Picture of a man and his work that I want, ... but the actual\r\nnatural Likeness, true as the face itself, nay, _truer_ in a sense,\r\nWhich the Artist, if there is one, might help to give, and the Botcher\r\nnever can\" (Carlyle, _Friedrich_).\r\n\r\n\r\n291. PORTRAIT OF A GIRL.\r\n\r\n  _Lucas Cranach_ (German: 1472-1553).\r\n\r\n      Lucas Sunder (or possibly Müller), called Cranach from\r\n      his native place, was one of the chief of the German\r\n      painters,--after Dürer, the most famous artist of his day.\r\n      He was the close friend of Martin Luther, whose features\r\n      he several times represented. He may indeed be called the\r\n      painter of the German Reformation, and in his later works\r\n      the reformed doctrines receive symbolical illustration. The\r\n      influences of the Renaissance were also at work in his art,\r\n      as may be seen in his classical subjects. He was fond also\r\n      of drawing birds and animals, and he often depicted hunting\r\n      scenes. These he rendered with a realism of effect which won\r\n      the admiration of his princely employers. It was, however, as a\r\n      portrait-painter that he was chiefly employed. His engravings\r\n      were also very numerous. In the lower left-hand corner of the\r\n      picture before us, a crowned serpent will be noticed. This\r\n      was the arms granted to him in 1508 by the Elector of Saxony,\r\n      and it superseded his initials on all his pictures after that\r\n      date. Of Cranach's earlier years, little is known. In 1504 he\r\n      was established at Wittenburg as court-painter to Frederick\r\n      the Wise, a post which he occupied under the next two Electors\r\n      as well. He was a man of importance at Wittenburg, for he was\r\n      twice mayor of the town, and carried on there, besides large\r\n      art workshops, a book-printing business and an apothecary's\r\n      shop. He was also employed in diplomatic missions, and when the\r\n      Elector Frederick the Magnanimous was in captivity at Augsburg,\r\n      Cranach was instrumental in procuring his release from the\r\n      Emperor Charles V., whose portrait had in earlier years been\r\n      taken by our painter.\r\n\r\n\"His female portraits have a sort of naïve grace that renders them\r\nvery pleasing. There is one in the National Gallery, of a young girl\r\nin elaborate costume, which is entirely characteristic\" (Bryan's\r\n_Dictionary of Painters_).\r\n\r\n\r\n292. MARTYRDOM OF ST. SEBASTIAN.\r\n\r\n  _Antonio Pollajuolo_ (Florentine: 1429-1498).\r\n\r\n      This picture is expressly ascribed by Vasari to Antonio alone.\r\n      On the other hand, Albertini, an earlier authority (1510),\r\n      ascribes it to Piero, the younger brother of Antonio. It is\r\n      known that many pictures were the joint production of both\r\n      brothers--Antonio furnishing the design, and Piero putting it\r\n      into colour. \"In the 'St. Sebastian,'\" says Sir F. Burton, \"we\r\n      probably have a work so produced; the severe and strenuous\r\n      drawing of the elder brother, the sculptor and _toreuta_ by\r\n      profession, is visible throughout; whether he shared in the\r\n      painting, and if he did, to what extent, may remain an open\r\n      question.\"\r\n\r\n      Antonio Pollajuolo (the \"poulterer,\"--so called from his\r\n      grandfather's trade) is an interesting man from two points of\r\n      view: first, as an instance of the union of the arts in old\r\n      times; for he was a working goldsmith and engraver as well as\r\n      a sculptor and painter. He took to painting comparatively late\r\n      in life, desiring, says Vasari, \"for his labour a more enduring\r\n      memory\" than belongs to works of the goldsmith's art; \"and his\r\n      brother Piero being a painter, he joined himself to him for\r\n      the purpose of learning the modes of proceeding in painting.\r\n      He acquired a knowledge in the course of a few months and\r\n      became an excellent master.\" He became, indeed, an excellent\r\n      draughtsman, but \"neither harmony of colours nor grace was\r\n      the strong point of this master\" (Morelli's _Italian Masters\r\n      in German Galleries_, p. 351). In 1484 Antonio was invited\r\n      to Rome by Pope Innocent VIII., and executed some important\r\n      monumental works in St. Peter's. His brother died in 1496;\r\n      Antonio, two years later. The two brothers were buried in S.\r\n      Pietro in Vincoli, where busts of them may be seen. Antonio\r\n      is interesting, in the second place, for the developments he\r\n      introduced into Italian painting. He was one of the first of\r\n      the Florentines to adopt an oil medium, and the first (says\r\n      Vasari) who had recourse to the dissection of the dead subject.\r\n      To him, therefore, Ruskin attributes a baleful influence. \"The\r\n      virtual beginner of artistic anatomy in Italy was a man called\r\n      'the poulterer'--Pollajuolo, a man of immense power, but on\r\n      whom the curse of the Italian mind in this age was set at its\r\n      deepest. See the horrible picture of St. Sebastian by him in\r\n      our National Gallery.\" He was the beginner of those anatomical\r\n      studies, continues Ruskin, which, pursued and established\r\n      by later masters, \"polluted their work with the science of\r\n      the sepulchre, and degraded it with presumptuous and paltry\r\n      technical skill. Foreshorten your Christ, and paint Him, if\r\n      you can, half-putrefied--that is the scientific art of the\r\n      Renaissance\" (_Ariadne Florentina_, Appendix IV.).\r\n\r\nHow popular this \"scientific art\" was in its day may be seen from the\r\nfollowing enthusiastic account which Vasari gives of this picture:--\r\n\r\n      A remarkable and admirably executed work, with numerous\r\n      horses, many undraped figures, and singularly beautiful\r\n      foreshortenings. This picture likewise contains the portrait\r\n      of St. Sebastian himself, taken from the life--from the face\r\n      of Gino di Ludovico Capponi, that is. The painting has been\r\n      more extolled than any other ever executed by Antonio. He has\r\n      evidently copied nature in this work to the utmost of his\r\n      power, as we perceive more particularly in one of the archers,\r\n      who, bending towards the earth, and resting his weapon against\r\n      his breast, is employing all the force of a strong arm to\r\n      prepare it for action; the veins are swelling, the muscles\r\n      strained, and the man holds his breath as he applies all his\r\n      strength to the effort. Nor is this the only figure executed\r\n      with care; all the others are likewise well done, and in the\r\n      diversity of their attitudes give clear proof of the artist's\r\n      ability and of the labour bestowed by him on his work; all\r\n      which was fully acknowledged by Antonio Pucci, who gave him\r\n      three hundred scudi for the picture, declaring at the same time\r\n      that he was barely paying him for the colours. This work was\r\n      completed in the year 1475.\r\n\r\nThe dominant motive in the picture is, it will be seen, interest in\r\nthe mechanism of the human body; notice especially the muscles of the\r\nexecutioners' legs and their efforts in stretching their bows. There\r\nare, however, other points worthy of notice. \"The work is not less\r\nremarkable for the extent and variety of the landscape, and for the\r\nsense of aerial, as distinct from mere linear, perspective. Instead\r\nof standing up like a wall behind the figures it appears to recede to\r\nthe horizon, as in nature. The study of the remains of classical art\r\nalso is betrayed by the introduction of one of the Roman monumental\r\narches in the background. The groups of soldiers and horses introduced\r\nat different distances further attest the variety of the designers'\r\ninterests\" (Monkhouse: _In the National Gallery_, 1894, p. 77).\r\n\r\n\r\n293. VIRGIN AND CHILD: STS. JEROME AND DOMINIC.\r\n\r\n  _Filippino Lippi_ (Florentine: 1457-1504).\r\n\r\n      Filippo Lippi, the younger (called \"Filippino\" to distinguish\r\n      him from his father), was the son of Fra Filippo Lippi (see\r\n      666), and the nun, Lucrezia Buti. In his will, Filippino left\r\n      an annual provision of corn, wine, oil, and other necessaries\r\n      to his beloved mother Lucrezia, daughter of Francesco Buti.\r\n      There is perhaps no other case in art-history of father and son\r\n      attaining such nearly equal excellence as did the two Lippis.\r\n      Owing to his father's death when Filippino was still a boy,\r\n      the latter became the pupil of Botticelli, and so good a pupil\r\n      was he that the critics are often in doubt, as explained in\r\n      the footnote, to which master to ascribe pictures.[138] The\r\n      genius of Filippino seems to have been the more gentle, that of\r\n      Botticelli the more impetuous. The grace and charm of Filippino\r\n      are nowhere better shown than in the \"Vision of St. Bernard,\"\r\n      in the church of the Badia at Florence--a work executed when\r\n      he was about 23. A copy of it is in the Arundel Society's\r\n      collection. The pictures in our Gallery which are indubitably\r\n      by Filippino (namely, this picture and 927), show the same\r\n      quiet beauty. Filippino was also employed upon important\r\n      frescoes--in the Branacci Chapel, in Sta Maria Novella, and (at\r\n      Rome) in Sta Maria Sopra Minerva; in these works he shows great\r\n      skill in composition, appropriate action, and refined feeling.\r\n      Filippino lived a busy and a blameless life; and the peace and\r\n      beauty of his pictures were a reflection of his character.\r\n      \"Having been ever courteous, obliging, and friendly, Filippino\r\n      was lamented,\" says Vasari, \"by all who had known him, but more\r\n      particularly by the youth of Florence, his native city; and\r\n      when his funeral procession was passing through the streets,\r\n      the shops were closed, as is done for the most part at the\r\n      funerals of princes only.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture is identified by the arms of the Rucellai family below, as\r\nthe one described by Vasari as \"executed in the church of San Pancrazio\r\nfor the chapel of the Rucellai family.\" After the suppression of the\r\nchurch, it was removed to the Palazzo Rucellai until it was purchased\r\nfor the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n294. THE FAMILY OF DARIUS.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Veronese_ (Veronese: 1528-1588). _See 260._\r\n\r\nThis picture--\"the most precious Paul Veronese,\" says Ruskin, \"in\r\nthe world\"--is, according to another critic, \"in itself a school of\r\nart, where every quality of the master is seen in perfection--his\r\nstately male figures, his beautiful women, his noble dog, and even his\r\nfavourite monkey, his splendid architecture, gem-like colour, tones\r\nof gold and silver, sparkling and crisp touch, marvellous facility of\r\nhand and unrivalled power of composition.\"[139] The glowing colour is\r\nwhat strikes one first; and next the dignity, life, and ease of the\r\nprincipal persons represented. It is a splendid example too of what the\r\nhistorical pictures of the old masters were. The scene represented is\r\nthat of the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great, surrounded by\r\nhis generals, receiving the submission of the family of the defeated\r\nPersian King Darius; but in his treatment of the scene, Veronese makes\r\nit a piece of contemporary Venetian life.\r\n\r\n      \"It is a constant law that the greatest men, whether poets or\r\n      historians, live entirely in their own age.... Dante paints\r\n      Italy in the thirteenth century; Chaucer, England in the\r\n      fourteenth; Masaccio, Florence in the fifteenth; Tintoret,\r\n      Venice in the sixteenth;--all of them utterly regardless\r\n      of anachronism and minor error of every kind, but getting\r\n      always vital truth out of the vital present.... Tintoret and\r\n      Shakespeare paint, both of them, simply Venetian and English\r\n      nature as they saw it in their time, down to the root; and it\r\n      does for _all_ time; but as for any care to cast themselves\r\n      into the particular ways and tones of thought or custom of past\r\n      time in their historical work, you will find it in neither of\r\n      them, nor in any other perfectly great man that I know of\"\r\n      (_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. vii. §§ 19, 20).\r\n\r\nThus here Veronese simply paints a group of living Venetians of his\r\ntime,[140] dog,[141] monkey and all. Alexander, in red armour, is\r\npointing to his friend Hephaestion, who stands a little behind on his\r\nleft, and whom the captives had at first mistaken for the king. The\r\nqueen-mother implores his pardon, but Alexander tells her that she has\r\nnot erred, for that Hephaestion is another Alexander. The principal\r\nfigures representing these different characters are, however, all\r\ncontemporary portraits of the Pisani family,[142] it is said, for whom\r\nthe picture was painted, and in choosing this scene of Alexander in\r\none of his best moments Veronese was expressing his ideal of Venetian\r\nnobility and refinement. \"The greatest portrait painters,\" says\r\nRuskin,--\"Titian, Veronese, Velazquez, and Raphael,--introduce the\r\nmost trenchant, clear, and complete backgrounds. Indeed, the first\r\nthree so rejoiced in quantity of accessories, that, when engaged on\r\nimportant portraits, they would paint large historical pictures merely\r\nby way of illustration or introduction. The priceless Veronese, 'The\r\nTriumph of Alexander,' was painted only to introduce portraits of the\r\nPisani; and chiefly to set off to the best advantage the face of one\r\nfair girl\" (_Academy Notes_, 1857, p. 37). So too the dresses to which\r\nthe picture owes so much of its splendour, are the Venetian dresses\r\nof the period. It may be interesting to remark that something of the\r\nmagnificence in the picture itself attaches also to the circumstances\r\nof its painting. Veronese having been detained by some accident at\r\nthe Pisani Villa at Este, painted this work there, and left it behind\r\nhim, sending word that he had left wherewithal to defray the expense\r\nof his entertainment. As the Pisani family ultimately sold it to the\r\nNational Gallery in 1857 for £13,650, Veronese's words were decidedly\r\nmade good. It may be interesting to add that the negotiations for its\r\npurchase extended over nearly four years. Vast sums had been offered\r\nfor the picture in former centuries, and within the previous thirty\r\nyears sovereigns, public bodies, and individuals had all been competing\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nSome of the fame of the picture is due to its splendid preservation.\r\nRumohr speaks of it as \"perhaps the only existing criterion by which\r\nto estimate the original colouring of Paul Veronese.\" \"The lakes, for\r\ninstance, in the crimson cuirass and dress of Alexander, which form\r\nsuch a magnificent feature in the composition, are,\" says Sir Edward\r\nPoynter, \"as fresh as when first painted, as, indeed, is the whole\r\npicture.\" James Smetham, in one of his eloquent letters, refers to this\r\nwork in 1858, in illustration of the enduring qualities of a painter's\r\n\"flying touches\"--touches \"destined to live in hours and moments when\r\n_you_ have fled beyond all moments into the unembarrassed calm of\r\neternity\":--\r\n\r\n      Paul Veronese, three hundred years ago, painted that bright\r\n      Alexander, with his handsome, flushed Venetian face, and that\r\n      glowing uniform of the Venetian general which he wears; and\r\n      before him, on their knees, he set those golden ladies, who are\r\n      pleading in pink and violet; and there he is, and there are\r\n      they, in our National Gallery; he, flushed and handsome--they,\r\n      golden and suppliant as ever. It takes an oldish man to\r\n      remember the comet of 1811. Who remembers Paul Veronese, nine\r\n      generations since? But not a tint of his thoughts is unfixed,\r\n      they beam along the walls as fresh as ever. Saint Nicholas\r\n      stoops to the Angelic Coronation (26), and the solemn fiddling\r\n      of the Marriage at Cana is heard along the silent galleries of\r\n      the Louvre. (\"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are\r\n      sweeter\")--yes, and will be so when you and I have cleaned our\r\n      last palette, and \"in the darkness over us, the four-handed\r\n      mole shall scrape.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n205. OUR SAVIOUR AND THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Quentin Metsys_ (Flemish: 1460-1530).\r\n\r\n      Metsys--whose name appears also in the forms Matsys, Massys,\r\n      and Messys--was the first of the great Antwerp painters and\r\n      the last who remained faithful to the traditions of the early\r\n      Flemish school. The gold background here recalls the earliest\r\n      Flemish pictures in the Gallery. \"He retained,\" says Sir F.\r\n      Burton, \"the technical method introduced by the Van Eycks, but\r\n      with a softer and broader handling, and with a wonderfully\r\n      subtle modelling which gave perfect relief and rounding\r\n      without dark shadows.\" Among the most important monuments of\r\n      his skill are the large altar-pieces in the public galleries of\r\n      Brussels and Antwerp respectively. There are in other galleries\r\n      pictures similar to the two figures here before us. Metsys was\r\n      also fond of depicting merchants or money-changers counting\r\n      their gains--a subject imitated by Marinus van Romerswael\r\n      (see 944). Metsys was a native of Antwerp, and a person of\r\n      consequence in his native town. A romantic legend was formerly\r\n      associated with his name. He was, it is said, a locksmith, but\r\n      became a painter to obtain the consent of his wife's father\r\n      to his marriage. Hence the inscription--_connubalis amor de\r\n      mulcibre fecit Apellem_. But this story, it now appears,\r\n      belongs to another Metsys, of Louvain. Our painter was twice\r\n      married. Portraits of himself and his second wife are in the\r\n      Uffizi at Florence.\r\n\r\nThese figures are remarkable for their serenity and dignity.\r\nCharacteristic also is the care lavished on the jewellery and edgings.\r\nThe figure of our Saviour somewhat resembles the \"Salvator Mundi\" of\r\nAntonella da Messina (673)--the Italian painter who introduced the\r\nFlemish influence to his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n296. THE VIRGIN ADORING THE INFANT CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  Florentine School (15th Century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      The authorship of this picture and of No. 781, which must\r\n      be by the same hand, is one of the unsolved problems of art\r\n      criticism. It has at different times been ascribed to Domenico\r\n      Ghirlandajo, to Antonio Pollajuolo, to the school of Piero\r\n      Pollajuolo, to Verrocchio, and to an unknown master in the\r\n      school of the last-mentioned painter. Sir F. Burton said, \"If\r\n      not by Verrocchio, it must be the work of one of his most\r\n      distinguished pupils.\" Sir Edward Poynter says, \"This picture\r\n      has all the characteristics of Andrea del Verrocchio's best\r\n      work, and is probably by that painter; but the small number of\r\n      works that can with certainty be ascribed to him renders the\r\n      attribution uncertain.\" Andrea del Verrocchio (1435-1488) was\r\n      the sculptor of the celebrated equestrian statue of Bartolommeo\r\n      Colleoni at Venice, than which, says Ruskin, \"I do not believe\r\n      that there is a more glorious work of sculpture existing in\r\n      the world\" (_Stones of Venice_, vol. iii. ch. I, § 22). As\r\n      a painter Verrocchio was for a time the master of Leonardo\r\n      da Vinci, who painted the figure of an angel in Verrocchio's\r\n      \"Baptism of Christ\" (in the Florentine Academy). \"This figure,\"\r\n      says Vasari (ii. 255), \"was so much superior to the other parts\r\n      of the picture that, perceiving this, Verrocchio resolved\r\n      never again to take pencil in hand.\" Whether this be so or\r\n      not, Verrocchio left an enduring mark on the art of his time.\r\n      \"He delighted to paint the _putto_--the infant boy who is just\r\n      beginning to rejoice in the use of his limbs--and with such\r\n      a charm did he invest his creations of this kind, whether in\r\n      sculpture or in painting, that,\" says Dr. Meyer, \"it is not too\r\n      much to say that he was the creator of that child-type which\r\n      is so universal in the Italian art of the _Cinque-cento_.\"\r\n      \"Verrocchio,\" says E. Müntz, \"is the plastic artist, deeply\r\n      enamoured of form, delighting in hollowing it out, in fining it\r\n      down; he has none of the literary temperament of a Donatello,\r\n      a Mantegna, masters who in order to give expression to the\r\n      passions that stir them, to realise their ideal, need a vast\r\n      theatre, numerous actors, dramatic subjects. There is no\r\n      _mise-en-scène_, no searching after recondite ideas, with\r\n      Verrocchio. Most suggestive in spirit, he sowed more than he\r\n      reaped, and produced more pupils than masterpieces. All there\r\n      is of feminine, one might almost say effeminate, in Leonardo's\r\n      art, the delicacy, the _morbidezza_, the suavity, appear,\r\n      though often merely in embryo, in the work of Verrocchio\"\r\n      (_Leonardo da Vinci_, i. 23, 25). The one undoubted picture\r\n      by Verrocchio is \"The Baptism\" above referred to. In the St.\r\n      George's Museum at Sheffield there is a \"Madonna Adoring\"\r\n      which has a marked affinity (especially in the Virgin's\r\n      expression and attitude, and in her peculiar head-dress) to our\r\n      picture. Ruskin, who purchased it in Venice from the Manfrini\r\n      collection, ascribed it unhesitatingly to Verrocchio, and\r\n      called it \"a picture of extreme value, which teaches all I want\r\n      my pupils to learn of art.\" For an excellent reproduction of\r\n      it, and for a full discussion both of it and of our picture,\r\n      the reader should consult Mr. W. White's _Principles of Art as\r\n      illustrated in the Ruskin Museum_ (pp. 62-83). The angel on the\r\n      left of this picture resembles the angel in the \"Baptism,\" and\r\n      the drawing of a head in the Uffizi at Florence by Verrocchio\r\n      is a study for an angel. Dr. Richter, however, thinks the\r\n      picture must be ascribed to a pupil of Verrocchio only, for\r\n      \"the artist of the Colleoni monument could not have been guilty\r\n      of the abnormal extension given to the lower part of the\r\n      Virgin's body. What should we have to say of the proportions of\r\n      this figure if she were to rise from her seat?\" (_Italian Art\r\n      in the National Gallery_, p. 33). Morelli, on the other hand,\r\n      on the strength of various technical details, ascribes the\r\n      picture to Pollajuolo (_Italian Masters in German Galleries_,\r\n      pp. 353-355).\r\n\r\nThis picture, whatever may be its authorship, is certainly one of\r\nthe most beautiful examples of Florentine art in the second half of\r\nthe fifteenth century. Of a very individual and fascinating type are\r\nthe faces of the two angels; their sweet and childlike loveliness\r\nwill haunt the memory of any visitor who has once studied them. Mr.\r\nMonkhouse suggests that they may represent some member of the Medici\r\nfamily: \"It is at all events evident that the originals of these\r\nbeautiful children, however elevated by the refinement of the artist,\r\nbelonged to no common stock. Nor can there be any doubt that this\r\nextremely elegant type, dainty to a degree unknown before, has a close\r\naffinity to the ideal of Leonardo da Vinci.\" The angels' hands in our\r\npicture are also very beautiful, though there is a touch of awkward\r\naffectation in the disjointed bend of the little finger in the angel on\r\nthe left. The spectator will notice further the beautiful embroidery,\r\nand the jewelled brooches worn both by this angel and by the Madonna.\r\nThe child holds a raspberry in one hand, some seeds of which he puts\r\nto his lips. The expression of the mother is very beautiful in its\r\nserene happiness of worship. Her head-dress is peculiar. \"The light\r\ngolden hair is entirely off the forehead, with but little showing, and\r\nis formed into a kind of pad, enclosed in an ornamental veil of thin\r\nmaterial, which being tied round upon the top of the head, lightly\r\nforms a triangular curved peak upon the forehead, and hangs down\r\ngracefully on either shoulder.\" The entire picture is, as Kugler says,\r\n\"a work of the most attractive character, from its careful finish, its\r\nrich and transparent colour, and its great beauty of expression.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n297. THE NATIVITY.\r\n\r\n  _Il Romanino_ (Brescian: about 1485-1566).\r\n\r\n      Girolamo Romani was a native of Brescia and the son of a\r\n      painter; his family belonged originally to the small town of\r\n      Romano, in the province of Bergamo: hence his name, \"Romanino.\"\r\n      Like Moretto (whose rival he was), he was little known outside\r\n      the district of Brescia; but he studied at Venice, where he\r\n      took Giorgione for his pattern. His best works are remarkable\r\n      for a brilliant golden colouring, which is unfortunately not\r\n      conspicuous in this picture. It pervades the fine altar-piece\r\n      of the \"Madonna Enthroned\" in S. Francesco at Brescia. Another\r\n      splendid altar-piece is to be seen in the museum at Padua.\r\n      Among Romanino's frescoes may be mentioned the lively scenes he\r\n      executed for the Castle of Malpaga. Copies of these are in the\r\n      Arundel Society's collection.\r\n\r\nOf this altar-piece--painted in 1525 for the church of St. Alessandro\r\nat Brescia--Mr. Pater gives the following description: \"Alessandro,\r\npatron of the church, one of the many youthful patrician converts\r\nItaly reveres from the ranks of the Roman army, stands on one side,\r\nwith ample crimson banner superbly furled about his lustrous black\r\narmour; and on the other--St. Jerome, Romanino's own namesake--neither\r\nmore nor less than the familiar, self-tormenting anchorite.... But\r\nthe loveliest subjects are in the corners above--Gaudioso, Bishop of\r\nBrescia, above St. Jerome; above Alessandro, St. Filippo Benizzi,\r\nmeek founder of the order of Servites to which that church at Brescia\r\nbelonged, with his lily, and in the right hand a book, and what a\r\nbook!... If you wish to see what can be made of the leaves, the vellum\r\ncovers of a book, observe that in St. Philip's hands. The metre? the\r\ncontents? you ask: What may they be? and whence did it come?--Out of\r\nembalmed sacristy, or antique coffin of some early Brescian martyr,\r\nor, through that bright space of blue Italian sky, from the hands of\r\nan angel, like his Annunciation lily, or the book received in the\r\nApocalypse by John the Divine? It is one of those old saints, Gaudioso\r\n(at home in every church of Brescia), who looks out with full face\r\nfrom the opposite corner of the altar-piece, from a background which,\r\nthough it might be the new heaven over a new earth, is in truth only\r\nthe proper, breathable air of Italy. As we see him here, Saint Gaudioso\r\nis one of the more exquisite treasures of our National Gallery. It\r\nwas thus that, at the magic touch of Romanino's art, the dim, early,\r\nhunted-down Brescian church of the primitive centuries, crushed into\r\nthe dust, it might seem, was 'brought to her king,' out of those old\r\ndark crypts, 'in raiment of needlework'--the delicate, richly-folded,\r\npontifical white vestments, the mitre and staff and gloves, and rich\r\njewelled cope, blue or green.[143] The face, of remarkable beauty,\r\nafter a type which all feel, though it is actually rare in art, is\r\nprobably a portrait of some distinguished churchman of Romanino's own\r\nday: a second Gaudioso, perhaps, setting that later Brescian church to\r\nrights after the terrible French occupation in the painter's own time,\r\nas his saintly predecessor, the Gaudioso of the earlier century here\r\ncommemorated, had done after the invasion of the Goths. The eloquent\r\neyes are open upon some glorious vision. 'He hath made us kings and\r\npriests!' they seem to say for him, as the clean, sensitive lips might\r\ndo so eloquently. Beauty and holiness had 'kissed each other,' as in\r\nBorgognone's imperial deacons at the Certosa. At the Renaissance the\r\nworld might seem to have parted them again. But here certainly, once\r\nmore, Catholicism and the Renaissance, religion and culture, holiness\r\nand beauty, might seem reconciled, by one who had conceived neither\r\nafter any feeble way, in a gifted person. Here at least, by the skill\r\nof Romanino's hand, the obscure martyr of the crypts shines as a saint\r\nof the later Renaissance, with a sanctity of which the elegant world\r\nitself would hardly escape the fascination, and which reminds one how\r\nthe great Apostle St. Paul has made courtesy part of the content of the\r\nDivine charity itself. A Rubens in Italy!--so Romanino has been called.\r\nIn this gracious presence we might think that, like Rubens also, he had\r\nbeen a courtier\" (\"Art Notes in North Italy\" in _New Review_, November\r\n1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n298. THE TWO ST. CATHERINES.\r\n\r\n  _Ambrogio Borgognone_ (Lombard: about 1455-1523).\r\n\r\n      Ambrogio Borgognone, called also Ambrogio da Fossano, the\r\n      latter being the name of a town in Piedmont, was born at Milan.\r\n      \"It may have been Ambrogio's grandfather or great-grandfather\r\n      who left the little Piedmontese town to settle at Milan; one of\r\n      his ancestors had probably lived some time in Flanders (then\r\n      called Borgogna by the Italians) and had thus received the\r\n      surname of Borgognone. Ambrogio, who holds the same central\r\n      place in the Milanese School of painting as Perugino in that\r\n      of Perugia, and Francia in that of Bologna, was, according to\r\n      my view, a pupil of Vincenzo Foppa the elder, and the real\r\n      master of Bernardino Luini, the Raphael of the Milanese school.\r\n      He remains in all his works a thorough Lombard\" (Morelli's\r\n      _German Galleries_, p. 419). The tenderness of feeling in\r\n      this \"Perugino of the Lombard School\" is very marked. \"The\r\n      presentment of divine or holy personages, in calm serenity\r\n      or in resigned suffering, accorded best,\" says Burton, \"with\r\n      his temperament. Even his colouring partakes of the pervading\r\n      sentiment; the grey pallor of his heads is only modified, now\r\n      and then, by the reddened eyelids of sorrow. In the Accademia\r\n      at Pavia is a small picture, representing Christ bearing his\r\n      cross, and followed by some Carthusian Brothers, which in\r\n      simple pathos and deep religious meaning is perhaps without\r\n      its equal in art.\" Ambrogio was distinguished as an architect\r\n      no less than as a painter, and was employed on the façade of\r\n      the Certosa of Pavia--a view of which building figures in the\r\n      background of a picture by Ambrogio in our gallery (1410).\r\n\r\nFor St. Catherine of Alexandria, see under 693; for St. Catherine of\r\nSiena, under 249. Each of them was proclaimed the spouse of Christ for\r\nthe love they bore him. And Borgognone here places them on either side\r\nof the Madonna's throne. \"Their names are inscribed on the haloes which\r\nsurround their heads. The Madonna--an exquisite example of the earlier\r\nand purer Lombard type--sits enthroned on a raised seat, which may be\r\ncompared with that of the Blenheim Madonna and of many other Virgins in\r\nour collection. The Child, erect on her knees and short-coated after\r\nthe earlier wont, is in the very act of placing the ring of His mystic\r\nwedding on the timorous hand of St. Catherine of Alexandria. The Saint\r\nherself, as the earlier and more famous of the two, stands at the right\r\nhand of Our Lady. In her left she grasps the palm of martyrdom. As\r\nPrincess of Egypt the meek and beautiful lady wears a regal crown. Her\r\nlong wavy hair, of the type which we usually regard as Leonardesque,\r\nbut which Leonardo really acquired in Lombardy, is characteristic of\r\nthis saint, even in pictures of other schools (_cf._ the Umbrian,\r\nNo. 646). At her feet lies the wheel, with its conventional hooked\r\nspikes, which was the instrument of her torture. On the Madonna's left\r\nstands St. Catherine of Siena in her Dominican robes. Her face is pure\r\nsaintliness--a marvel of beauty; her left hand holds the ascetic white\r\nlily of the Dominican order; her right the Madonna takes with a gentle,\r\nand one might almost say consolatory gesture. Our Lady seems to comfort\r\nher for her less favoured position; and if you look close you will see\r\nthat the infant Saviour holds in His left hand a second ring, which He\r\nextends with childish grace towards the Nun of Siena\" (Grant Allen in\r\n_Pall Mall Magazine_, June-December 1895, p. 66).\r\n\r\n\r\n299. PORTRAIT OF AN ITALIAN NOBLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Moretto_ (Brescian: 1498-1555).\r\n\r\n      In examples of the Brescian, as of the Veronese School, the\r\n      National Gallery is very rich. \"The dialect of the Brescians\r\n      is very like that of their neighbours of Bergamo, but not so\r\n      harsh and rugged (see 1203): the character of the people,\r\n      too, is more lively and frank, more given to show and swagger\r\n      (Bresciani spacca-cantoni). The Brescians, wedged in between\r\n      the Veronese and Bergamese, unite, to some extent, the manly\r\n      energy of the latter with the greater vivacity and pliancy of\r\n      the former\" (_Morelli_). The foundation of the Brescian School\r\n      was laid by Vincenzo Foppa (see 729), whose pupil Il Moretto\r\n      was. It is characteristic of the wide dispersion of the art\r\n      gift in Italy that this Alessandro Bonvicino, nicknamed \"Il\r\n      Moretto,\"--one of the greatest of portrait painters,--should\r\n      have belonged entirely to a provincial city. He was born and\r\n      educated at Brescia, where his father was a merchant; and\r\n      with the exception of a very few pictures, he painted only\r\n      for his native town and the province of Brescia, and it is\r\n      there that nearly the whole work of his life is still to be\r\n      found. Indeed he was little known beyond the frontiers of\r\n      the Brescian district, and it is only during the last half\r\n      century or so that his reputation has arisen. Moretto never\r\n      studied in Venice; his development and genius are native, and\r\n      he rivalled Titian himself in the stateliness and dignity\r\n      of his figures. His altar-pieces are distinguished further\r\n      by much gravity of feeling and sincerity of unostentatious\r\n      religious feeling. The picture in our own gallery (625) is a\r\n      good example. Others are to be found in the churches of his\r\n      native town and in some foreign galleries. Among the best are\r\n      the \"Coronation of the Virgin\" in SS. Nazzaro e Celso, Brescia;\r\n      \"St. Margaret\" in S. Francesco, Brescia; \"The Feast of the\r\n      Pharisee,\" S. Maria della Pietà, Venice; \"Madonna and Child,\"\r\n      Städel Institute, Frankfort; and \"S. Giustina,\" Belvedere,\r\n      Vienna. His nickname of \"the Blackamoor\" is particularly\r\n      inappropriate to his style, which is distinguished for its\r\n      silvery tones, \"a cool, tender, and harmonious scale of colour\r\n      which has a peculiar charm, and is entirely his own\" (_Layard_,\r\n      ii. 577). This harmony of colour, which became characteristic\r\n      of the Brescian School, may be observed also in his rival,\r\n      Romanino. Moretto is distinguished not more for his religious\r\n      subjects than for his portraits, of which we possess two very\r\n      beautiful specimens in the picture now before us, and in No.\r\n      1025. He was the master of another great portrait-painter,\r\n      Moroni of Bergamo (see 697), and works of the two are often\r\n      confused. In addition to the charm of his harmonious colouring,\r\n      Moretto's portraits are remarkable for the dignity he imparts\r\n      to his subjects. \"Moretto,\" says Morelli, \"shows himself the\r\n      higher artist of the two; his conception of a subject and\r\n      his drawing are nobler and more elegant than those of his\r\n      matter-of-fact scholar; but these intellectual qualities,\r\n      which are not perceptible to every eye, do not always suffice\r\n      to distinguish his weaker works from Moroni's best. In such\r\n      cases the only means we have of determining the authorship is\r\n      an exact and minute examination. The shape and expression of\r\n      the hand, for instance, are very different in Moroni from what\r\n      they are in Moretto. The hands of the latter, with pointed\r\n      fingers, suggestive of the academy, are never so true to nature\r\n      as those which Moroni can make when he chooses in drawing\r\n      from life. Moretto's flesh-colours, too, have a delicate\r\n      silver tone, while Moroni's, with their earth-like tints,\r\n      are more realistic\" (_German Galleries_, pp. 47-50, 169-171,\r\n      396-403).[144]\r\n\r\nThis painter is conspicuous, says Lanzi (_History of Painting in\r\nItaly_, Bohn's edition 1847, ii. 181), for his \"skill in imitating\r\nevery kind of velvet, satin, or other cloth, either of gold or silver.\"\r\nHis portraits are remarkable, as is noticed under 1025, for their\r\npoetic insight. He is not content with producing an obvious likeness\r\nin the flesh; he strives at portraying or suggesting some spiritual\r\nidea in all his sitters. These characteristics are conspicuous in\r\nthe present picture. Thus notice, first, the splendid brocades. Then\r\nsecondly, how the painter tells you not only that this was what the\r\nsitter looked like, but what was his character. It is clearly the\r\nportrait of some one who combined with an important position the\r\ntastes of a _dilettante_, and who had an aspiring soul. On his cap is\r\na label inscribed ιου λιαν ποθω, which being literally interpreted\r\nmeans \"Alas, I desire too much!\"--an inscription which accords with\r\nthe yearning upward gaze and the pose selected by the painter. But the\r\nmotto has also a punning reference. Reading the two first words as one,\r\nit becomes ιουλιαν ποθω, \"I desire Julia,\" or with a further pun on\r\nthe last word, \"Julia Potho.\" We thus obtain a clue to the identity of\r\nthe sitter. The Potho or Pozzo family was well known at the time in\r\nBrescia. Francesco dal Pozzo, 3rd Marquis of Ponderano (born 1494),\r\nhad as his first-born a daughter Julia. She became the wife of Giacomo\r\nGromo, Signor di Ternengo, who was a man of official status in Biella\r\nin 1539, having to do with the fiscal arrangements of the district.\r\nThis may be indicated in our picture by the two coins of bronze and\r\ngold, and the die or seal. The sandalled foot on the table (an antique\r\nlamp?) may indicate his love of antiquities. \"It is to be hoped, if\r\nour picture be a portrait of Monsignor Giacomo Gromo di Ternengo, that\r\nhe had not long to wait before he became the devoted husband of Julia\r\nPotho, for whom he so yearned, and whose favour he wore in his hat.\"\r\n(W. Fred Dickes in _Athenæum_, June 3 and Aug. 26, 1893).[145]\r\n\r\n\r\n300. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Cima da Conegliano_ (Venetian: 1460-1518).\r\n\r\n      Some miles north of Venice, in the Friuli, rises the town\r\n      of Conegliano, which, from its isolated and castled hill,\r\n      overlooks the plain of Treviso. Cima, whose real name was\r\n      Giovanni Battista, takes his title in art-history from the\r\n      \"cima,\" or castled \"height,\" of his native place--a picturesque\r\n      feature which he introduced, wherever it was at all possible,\r\n      into his pictures. We see these towers of Conegliano in\r\n      the present picture; and a window is opened in the large\r\n      composition, No. 816, in order to give us a glimpse of a\r\n      similar height. In his love of his native landscape is one of\r\n      the principal charms of Cima's work. \"Morning is his favourite\r\n      time--morning among the hills; and then and there the painter\r\n      enjoyed more happiness than any twilight gondola could give\r\n      him. In our National Gallery are two examples of the Conegliano\r\n      scenery, but the brilliant daylight that so distinguishes Cima\r\n      is strangely absent\" (Gilbert's _Landscape in Art_, p. 329).\r\n      One of his best works is the \"St. John the Baptist\" in the\r\n      church of S. Maria dell' Orto, Venice. \"He is here painting,\"\r\n      says Ruskin, \"his name-saint; the whole picture full of peace\r\n      and intense faith and hope, and deep joy in light of sky and\r\n      fruit and flower and weed of earth. The picture was painted\r\n      for the church of Our Lady of the Garden, and it is full of\r\n      simple flowers, and has the wild strawberry of Cima's native\r\n      mountains gleaming through the grass.... He has given us the\r\n      oak, the fig, the beautiful 'Erba della Madonna' on the wall,\r\n      precisely such a bunch of it as may be seen growing at this\r\n      day on the marble steps of that very church; ivy, and other\r\n      creepers, and a strawberry plant in the foreground, with a\r\n      blossom, and a berry just set, and one half-ripe, and one ripe,\r\n      all patiently and innocently painted from the real thing, and\r\n      therefore most divine.... His own Alps are in the distance,\r\n      and he shall teach us how to paint wild flowers, and how to\r\n      think of them\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch.\r\n      vii. § 9; vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. x. § 5; Oxford _Lectures on\r\n      Art_, § 150; _Catalogue of the Educational Series_, p. 27). The\r\n      charming landscape and fine colour of Cima are accompanied\r\n      by earnestness of religious feeling, and a sense of peace and\r\n      quiet, unmixed with any ascetism. \"The painter,\" says Ruskin,\r\n      of another of his pictures, \"does not desire the excitement\r\n      of rapid movement, nor even the passion of beautiful light.\r\n      But he hates darkness as he does death. He paints noble human\r\n      creatures simply in clear daylight; not in rapture, nor yet in\r\n      agony. The unexciting colour will not at first delight you;\r\n      but its charm will never fail, and you will find that you\r\n      never return to it but with a sense of relief and of peace....\r\n      Cima is not supreme in any artistic quality, but good and\r\n      praiseworthy in all\" (_Lectures on Landscape_, § 60; _Guide to\r\n      the Academy at Venice_, p. 14). Cima is usually reckoned among\r\n      the disciples of Giovanni Bellini, and is believed at one time\r\n      to have superintended the workshop of that master.\r\n\r\nIn the background, on the right, are the towers of Conegliano; on the\r\nleft, the neighbouring castle of Colalto. There is something very\r\npretty in the way in which the earlier Venetian masters placed their\r\nHoly Families in their own fields and amongst their own mountains\r\n(compare _e.g._ the Madonna in the Meadow, No. 599), thus imagining\r\nthe Madonna and her child not as a far-away sanctity in the sky, but\r\nas an actual presence nigh unto them, at their very doors.[146] \"There\r\nhas probably not been an innocent cottage-home throughout the length\r\nand breadth of Europe during the whole period of vital Christianity,\r\nin which the imagined presence of the Madonna has not given sanctity\r\nto the humblest duties, and comfort to the sorest trials of the lives\r\nof women; and every brightest and loftiest achievement of the arts and\r\nstrength of manhood has been the fulfilment of the assured prophecy of\r\nthe poor Israelite maiden, 'He that is mighty hath magnified me, and\r\nholy is his name'\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1874, p. 105).\r\n\r\n\r\n479. THE SUN RISING IN A MIST.\r\n\r\n  _J. M. W. Turner, R.A._ (British: 1775-1851).\r\n\r\nFor the circumstances under which this picture by Turner and the \"Dido\r\nBuilding Carthage\" (498) hang not in the Turner Gallery but beside the\r\nClaudes, see under 12.\r\n\r\nThis picture was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1807, and belongs\r\ntherefore to Turner's first period, which was distinguished by\r\n\"subdued colour and perpetual reference to precedent in composition.\"\r\nThis effect of sunrise in a mist was a favourite one with Dutch\r\npainters, and Turner, when he went to the sea-shore, painted it in\r\nthe Dutch manner. A time was to come when he would paint the sun\r\nrising no longer in a mist. Yet from the first, the bent of his own\r\nmind was visible in his work. He paints no such ideal futilities as\r\nare pointed out above in Claude's picture, but fishermen engaged in\r\ntheir daily toil. One of his father's best friends was a fishmonger,\r\nwhom he often visited: \"which gives us a friendly turn of mind towards\r\nherring-fishing, whaling, Calais poissardes, and many other of our\r\nchoicest subjects in afterlife.\" He was the painter not of \"pastoral\r\nindolence or classic pride, but of the labour of men, by sea and land\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. ix.).\r\n\r\n\r\n498. DIDO BUILDING CARTHAGE.\r\n\r\n  _J. M. W. Turner, R.A._ (British: 1775-1851).\r\n\r\nFrom the technical point of view this is not one of Turner's best\r\npictures. It was exhibited in 1815, and belongs therefore to his first\r\nperiod, when he had still not completely exorcised \"the brown demon.\"\r\nThe picture, says Ruskin, \"is quite unworthy of Turner as a colourist,\"\r\n\"his eye for colour unaccountably fails him,\"[147] and \"the foreground\r\nis heavy and evidently paint, if we compare it with genuine passages of\r\nClaude's sunshine\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii.\r\n§ 45, sec. ii. ch. i. § 13, ch. ii. § 18).\r\n\r\nBut there is a noble idea in the picture. Dido, Queen of Carthage,\r\nsurrounded by her people, and with plans and papers about her, is\r\nsuperintending the building of the city which was to become the great\r\nmaritime power of the ancient world. \"The principal object in the\r\nforeground (on the left) is a group of children sailing toy boats.\r\nThe exquisite choice of this incident, as expressive of the ruling\r\npassion which was to be the source of future greatness, in preference\r\nto the tumult of busy stone-masons or arming soldiers, is quite as\r\nappreciable when it is told as when it is seen,--it has nothing to do\r\nwith the technicalities of painting; a scratch of the pen would have\r\nconveyed the idea and spoken to the intellect as much as the elaborate\r\nrealisations of colour. Such a thought as this is something far above\r\nall art; it is epic poetry of the highest order\" (_Modern Painters_,\r\nvol. i. pt. i. sec. i. ch. vii. § 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n564. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH SCENES FROM THE LIVES OF THE SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Margaritone_ (Tuscan: 1216-1293).\r\n\r\n      Margaritone, famous in his time (like so many of his\r\n      successors) for painting, sculpture, and architecture\r\n      alike, was a native of Arezzo, and was \"the last of the\r\n      Italian artists who painted entirely after the Greek (or\r\n      Byzantine) manner,\" from which Cimabue and Giotto were the\r\n      first to depart.[148] He died at the age of seventy-seven,\r\n      \"afflicted and disgusted (says Vasari) that he had lived to\r\n      see the changes by which all honours were transferred to new\r\n      artists.\" This picture being, according to the critics, the\r\n      most important and characteristic picture of the artist still\r\n      remaining, should, therefore, be carefully studied by those\r\n      who are interested in tracing the history of art. Of the\r\n      Greek manner, in which art was for so many centuries encased,\r\n      one may notice, first, that there was no attempt to depict\r\n      things like life. Art, as the phrase goes, was \"symbolic,\" not\r\n      \"representative.\" Certain definite symbols, certain definite\r\n      attitudes, were understood to mean certain things. Just as in\r\n      earlier Greek painting white flesh, for instance, was taken to\r\n      denote a woman, black or red flesh a man, so here such and such\r\n      attitudes were accepted as meaning that the figure in question\r\n      was the Virgin, and such and such other attitudes that it was\r\n      the Christ. Secondly, these symbols were all expressive of\r\n      various dogmas of the Church--of creeds and formulas peculiar\r\n      to one sect rather than of spiritual truths common to all\r\n      Christianity.\r\n\r\nBoth characteristics may be traced in almost every line of this\r\npicture. For instance, the humanity of Christ is not yet even hinted\r\nat, his divinity alone being insisted upon. Thus the young God is here\r\nrepresented in the form of a man-child; erect, with the assumed dignity\r\nof an adult, as he raises his hand to bless the faithful. With his left\r\nhand he holds the roll in which are written the names of the faithful\r\nsaved: it is as a judge that he comes into the world. The Virgin again\r\nis here shown as elect of God to be the mother of God: not as the\r\nmother of Jesus, the mother of man's highest humanity. She wears on\r\nher head the fleur-de-lys coronet, symbol of purity; and the glory, or\r\naureole, around her represents the acrostic symbol of the fish, the\r\nGreek word for fish containing the initials of the several Greek words\r\nmeaning \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour.\" Outside this \"Vesica\" (or\r\n\"fish glory\"), in the four corners, are four Jewish symbols (Ezekiel\r\ni. 10), adopted as emblems of the four Evangelists--the Angel (St.\r\nMatthew), the Ox (St. Luke), the Lion (St. Mark), and the Eagle (St.\r\nJohn). So again, in the scenes on either side of the central piece\r\nwe see the same gloomy theology, in which the world is thought of\r\nsolely as a place made hideous with evils, where saints are boiled\r\nby pagans, women slain by seducers, children devoured by dragons. By\r\nhelp of such pictured deeds of hell, men were taught by the early\r\nChurch to \"loathe this base world and think of heaven's bliss.\" The\r\nfirst subject (on the spectator's left) represents the birth of Christ\r\nin a cattle-shed; the second St. John the Evangelist, calm midst the\r\ncauldron of seething oil, the martyr's uplifted hand expressing the\r\nprecept, \"Pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.\"\r\nThe third subject depicts in a rude symbolic way incidents in the\r\nlife of St. Catherine--her beheading, her soul's reception by angels,\r\nand the burial of her body by two angels on Mount Sinai. The fourth\r\nsubject shows St. Nicolas appearing suddenly to some sailors, whom he\r\nexhorts to throw overboard a vase given by the devil. In the fifth is\r\nSt. John resuscitating the body of Drusiana, a matron who had lived\r\nin his house previous to his departure, and whose bier he had chanced\r\nto meet on his return to Ephesus. In the next subject St. Benedict,\r\nfounder of the Benedictine Order, is shown in the act of throwing\r\nhimself into a thicket of briars and nettles, as he rushes from his\r\ncave to rid himself of the recollection of a beautiful woman he had\r\nonce met in Rome, and whose image now tempts him to leave his chosen\r\nsolitude. In the seventh, St. Nicolas liberates three innocent men;\r\nand in the eighth is represented St. Margaret, patron saint of women\r\nin childbirth, whom the devil in the form of a dragon confronts to\r\nterrify into abnegation of her Christian faith. Unable to persuade her,\r\nhe devours her, but bursts in the midst, and by power of the Cross she\r\nemerges unhurt. It is interesting to observe that the two consecutive\r\nacts are here shown as co-existent: a thing frequently done, as we have\r\nseen, in early art. Finally, another characteristic feature is the\r\nintroduction of the \"grotesque\" in the animals that support the throne\r\nas a relief from the strained seriousness of the rest of the picture\r\n(A. H. Macmurdo in _Century Guild Hobby Horse_, i. 21-28).\r\n\r\nThe picture, signed by the painter, was an altar-front in the church of\r\nSanta Margherita at Arezzo. It is painted in _tempera_ on linen cloth\r\nattached to wood, and even in Vasari's day its preservation was deemed\r\nremarkable. \"It comprises,\" he says, \"many small figures, of better\r\nmanner than those of larger size, designed with more grace and finished\r\nwith greater delicacy; and this work deserves consideration, not\r\nonly because the little figures are so carefully done that they look\r\nlike miniatures, but also for the extraordinary fact that a picture\r\non canvas should have continued in such good preservation during 300\r\nyears\" (i. 89).\r\n\r\n\r\n565. THE MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Cimabue_ (Florentine: 1240-1302).\r\n\r\n      Giovanni Cenni, called Cimabue, has been called the \"Father of\r\n      Modern Painting.\" He imitated the Byzantine style, says Vasari,\r\n      but \"improved the art and relieved it greatly from its uncouth\r\n      manner.\" He did not entirely free himself from the dismal\r\n      formalism of his predecessors, but he infused new life into\r\n      the old traditional types. A contemporary of his was Niccola\r\n      Pisano, whose work in the allied art of sculpture shows a more\r\n      marked advance, and who perhaps really gave the new impulse\r\n      which art received at this period--an impulse carried on in the\r\n      field of painting by Cimabue's pupil, Giotto. Niccola Pisano,\r\n      says Ruskin, \"is the Master of Naturalism in Italy,--therefore\r\n      elsewhere: of Naturalism and all that follows\" (_Val d'Arno_,\r\n      § 16). Well-authenticated pictures by Cimabue are the Madonna\r\n      panel with angels in the Academy at Florence (formerly in the\r\n      church of SS. Trinita), and the colossal Madonna still in the\r\n      Rucellai chapel in S. Maria Novella. The latter is the picture\r\n      of which the well-known story, referred to below, is told. Our\r\n      picture, which is also mentioned by Vasari, was originally\r\n      attached to a pilaster in the choir of S. Croce.[149]\r\n      Cimabue also executed some of the frescoes in the Upper\r\n      Church at Assisi: and at the time of his death was occupied\r\n      on the mosaics in the tribune of the Duomo at Pisa. Copies\r\n      of Cimabue's frescoes may be seen in the Arundel Society's\r\n      Collection.\r\n\r\nThe changes which Cimabue introduced into the art of painting were\r\ntwofold. In the first place, his pictures show an _increase of\r\npictorial skill_. This picture has suffered much from time. Thus in the\r\nMadonna's face, which was originally laid in green and painted over\r\nthinly, time and restorations have removed this over-painting, and left\r\nthe green exposed (see also Duccio's 566). The green and purple of her\r\ndress also have changed into a dusky tone; but even so, the advance\r\nin pictorial skill may be seen in the shading of the colours, and the\r\nattempt to represent the light and dark masses of the drapery, whereas\r\nin earlier pictures the painters had been content with flat tints. But\r\nthe advance made by Cimabue was even more in spirit than in technical\r\nskill. He combined the contemplation of the South with the action of\r\nthe North. He gave the populace of his day something to look at--and\r\nsomething to love. \"Is she not beautiful,\" asks a critic before this\r\npicture, \"in simplicity and solemn majesty? Is she not a real mother\r\nwith a half sad and foreboding wistful look that goes straight to the\r\nheart?\" Cimabue's Madonna is still a Mater Dolorosa--\"our Lady of\r\nPain,\" but there is an attempt alike in her and in the child, and in\r\nthe attendant angels, to substitute for the conventional image of an\r\nideal personage the _representation of real humanity_. It was this\r\nchange that explains the story told of one of Cimabue's works, that\r\nit was carried in glad procession, with the sound of trumpets, from\r\nhis house to the church, and that the place was ever afterwards called\r\n\"Borgo Allegro\" (the joyful quarter)--a name which it bears to this\r\nday. \"This delight was not merely in the revelation of an art they\r\nhad not known how to practise; it was delight in the _revelation of a\r\nMadonna whom they had not known how to love_\" (_Mornings in Florence_,\r\nii. 48). In telling this story, Vasari adds that \"they had not seen\r\nanything better\"; the rudeness and quaintness which are all that at\r\nfirst sight are now discernible would then, it must be remembered, have\r\nbeen unseen. We may recall the poet's protest against those who,\r\n\r\n    Because of some stiff draperies and loose joints,\r\n      Gaze scorn down from the heights of Raffaelhood\r\n    On Cimabue's picture.\r\n\r\n  MRS. BROWNING: _Casa Guidi Windows_.\r\n\r\n\r\n566. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Duccio_ (Sienese: about 1260-1340).\r\n\r\n      Duccio, the son of Buoninsegna, did much the same for the\r\n      Sienese School as Cimabue and Giotto did for the Florentine.\r\n      He was the first, that is to say, who, forsaking partly the\r\n      conventional manner of the Byzantine School, endeavoured to\r\n      give some resemblance to nature, and in religious subjects to\r\n      bring down heaven to earth. \"He retained the ancient formulas,\r\n      destroying, however, their formalism by the inspiration of new\r\n      life.\" The development of Sienese art under his influence was\r\n      parallel to, yet distinct from, that in Florence. \"His feeling\r\n      is quite distinct; his pure, sweet, transparent colouring is\r\n      his own; his type of beauty more graceful and more classical,\r\n      and he loved more gentle curves, more oval faces and longer\r\n      limbs. In these things he followed his own temperament, and\r\n      by so doing determined the characteristics of the Sienese\r\n      School\" (Monkhouse: _In the National Gallery_, p. 17). In\r\n      1285 Duccio was commissioned to paint a large Madonna for\r\n      the church of S. Maria Novella at Florence. In 1308 he began\r\n      the execution of his Maestà for the cathedral of Siena, of\r\n      which some portions are now in the transept and others in the\r\n      Opera del Duomo. The revelation that Duccio made of the new\r\n      power of art was received, as was Cimabue's, with rapturous\r\n      applause, and a portion of the famous picture just referred to\r\n      was in 1310 carried in procession on a beautiful day in June\r\n      to the Cathedral amidst the ringing of bells and the sounding\r\n      of trumpets; the magistrates, clergy, and religious orders\r\n      escorting it, followed by a multitude of citizens with their\r\n      wives and families, praying as they went: the shops were closed\r\n      and alms distributed to the poor. For that masterpiece Duccio\r\n      received 16 soldi (8d.) the working day, paid to him in monthly\r\n      instalments. The city, however, found him his materials,\r\n      which, owing to the quantity of gold used (see 1139), raised\r\n      the whole cost to 3000 gold florins. Works by Duccio are a\r\n      speciality of the National Gallery, which has four of them to\r\n      show, 566, 1139, 1140, and 1330. The present picture is the\r\n      most important, and best illustrates the new departure made by\r\n      Duccio.\r\n\r\nThe young Christ, for instance, instead of being depicted in the act\r\nof priestly benediction (as in 564), is shown as a true babe, drawing\r\naside the veil that hides his Mother's face. In this little incident\r\none may thus see the tendency which was to lead to the representation\r\nof the Mother and Child as a Holy _Family_ (the spectator must have\r\n\"charity of imagination\" to ignore the green hue of the Madonna's\r\nface, for reasons stated under 565). \"A conception like this of the\r\nInfant Saviour is not met with, so far as I know, in the whole range\r\nof Byzantine art from the fifth century onwards. The relation of the\r\nChild to his mother, as here represented, the gesture of childlike\r\nlove, contrasting with the expression of melancholy in her face,\r\nwhich, perhaps, constitutes the principal charm of the picture--is\r\nan innovation. This motive does not occur in the work of Niccola\r\nPisano, the great sculptor who had executed a famous work in the\r\ncathedral of Siena some twenty years previously. We find it, however,\r\nin contemporary Gothic sculpture of France; a very characteristic\r\nexample is in the South Kensington Museum, a charming little ivory of\r\nthe Madonna standing with the Child in her arms\" (Richter's _Lectures\r\non the National Gallery_, p. 18). Above are seen the prophets, headed\r\nby David their king, while on either side St. Catherine[150] and St\r\nDominic adore the vision of the mother of God. The Byzantine influence,\r\non the other hand, may be seen in the Greek type of feature and long,\r\nslender fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n567. CHRIST ON THE CROSS.\r\n\r\n  _Segna di Buonaventura_ (Sienese: painted 1305-1326).\r\n\r\nA ghastly and conventional work by one of the early Sienese painters--a\r\npupil of Duccio.\r\n\r\n\r\n568. THE CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  School of _Giotto_ (Giotto: 1266-1336).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      Giotto di Bondone--great alike as a painter, a sculptor, and\r\n      an architect--was the son of a shepherd in the country near\r\n      Florence. One day when he was drawing a ram of his father's\r\n      flock with a stone upon a smooth piece of rock, Cimabue (see\r\n      565) happened to be passing by, and, seeing the lad's natural\r\n      bent, carried him off to be a painter. Cimabue taught him all\r\n      he knew, and in time the pupil eclipsed his master. Dante\r\n      mentions this as an instance of the vanity of Fame: \"Cimabue\r\n      thought to hold the field in painting, but now Giotto has the\r\n      cry.\" But another poet holds\r\n\r\n    That Cimabue smiled upon the lad\r\n      _At the first stroke which passed what he could do_,\r\n    Or else his Virgin's smile had never had\r\n      Such sweetness in't. All great men who foreknew\r\n    Their heirs in art, for art's sake have been glad.\r\n\r\n      MRS. BROWNING: _Casa Guidi Windows_.\r\n\r\n      The earliest examples of his work extant are the frescoes\r\n      forming the lower range in the Upper Church at Assisi. His\r\n      frescoes of the virtues in the Lower Church are believed to\r\n      belong to a later period. So great was his fame that in 1298\r\n      he was sent for to do some work for the Pope. It was for him\r\n      that Giotto sent as his testimonial the famous circle drawn\r\n      with a brush, without compasses. \"You may judge my masterhood\r\n      of craft,\" Giotto tells us, \"by seeing that I can draw a\r\n      circle unerringly.\" (Hence the saying, \"rounder than the O\r\n      of Giotto.\") After a short time in Rome, Giotto returned to\r\n      Florence and painted the chapel of the Podestà, or Bargello, of\r\n      Florence, which was rescued from destruction in 1841. Some of\r\n      Giotto's work in it was restored. Here is his famous portrait\r\n      of Dante (traced previous to restoration and published by the\r\n      Arundel Society). To a later period belong his frescoes in the\r\n      church of Santa Croce. In 1303 Giotto was called to decorate\r\n      the walls of the chapel of the Annunziata dell' Arena at\r\n      Padua. This he did with a series of compositions which are the\r\n      greatest monument of his genius. It was during the execution\r\n      of this work that Dante visited Padua, being entertained by\r\n      his friend the painter. \"Thus went Giotto, a serene labourer,\r\n      throughout the length and breadth of Italy. He engaged himself\r\n      in other tasks at Ferrara, Verona, and Ravenna, and at last\r\n      at Avignon, where he became acquainted with Petrarch. Then\r\n      passed rapidly through Florence and Orvieto on his way to\r\n      Naples, where he received the kindest welcome from the good\r\n      King Robert. The King, ever partial to men of mind and genius,\r\n      took especial delight in Giotto's society; and Giotto (says\r\n      Vasari), who had ever his repartee ready, held him fascinated\r\n      at once with the magic of his pencil and pleasantry of his\r\n      tongue. Returning to Florence, Giotto was appointed chief\r\n      master of the works of the Duomo then in progress. He designed\r\n      the Campanile, modelled the bas-relief for the base of the\r\n      building, and sculptured two of them with his own hand. He died\r\n      full of honour and at the zenith of his strength. He was buried\r\n      in the cathedral, at the angle nearest his campanile; and thus\r\n      the tower, which is the chief grace of his native city, may be\r\n      regarded as his own sepulchral monument.\" Only those who have\r\n      seen Giotto's wall paintings at Assisi, Padua, and Florence can\r\n      form any true conception of his greatness. It is pointed out\r\n      below in what respects his work was remarkable and important\r\n      for his time. It has also an abiding value in itself. \"In nine\r\n      cases out of ten,\" says Ruskin, \"the first expression of an\r\n      idea is the most valuable: the idea may afterwards be polished\r\n      and softened, and made more attractive to the general eye; but\r\n      the first expression of it has a freshness and brightness, like\r\n      the flash of a native crystal compared to the lustre of glass\r\n      that has been melted and cut. Giotto was not, indeed, one of\r\n      the most accomplished painters, but he was one of the greatest\r\n      men who ever lived. He was the first master of his time, in\r\n      architecture as well as in painting; he was the friend of\r\n      Dante, and the undisputed interpreter of religious truth, by\r\n      means of painting, over the whole of Italy. The works of such\r\n      a man may not be the best to set before children in order to\r\n      teach them drawing; but they assuredly should be studied with\r\n      the greatest care by all who are interested in the history of\r\n      the human mind\" (_Giotto and his Works in Padua_). Copies of\r\n      many of his works are in the Arundel Society's Collection.\r\n\r\nIt was Cimabue who first attempted to represent action as well as\r\ncontemplation. Giotto went farther, and represented the action of\r\ndaily life. \"Cimabue magnified the Maid; and Florence rejoiced in\r\nher Queen. But it was left for Giotto to make the queenship better\r\nbeloved, in its sweet humiliation.\" This picture is not by the master\r\nhimself, but it is characteristic--in its greater _naturalness_ and\r\nresemblance to human life--of Giotto's work. Cimabue's picture (565)\r\nis felt in a moment to be archaic beside it. Giotto is thus the first\r\npainter of domestic life--the \"reconciler of the domestic with the\r\nmonastic ideal, of household wisdom, labour of love, toil upon earth\r\naccording to the law of Heaven, with revelation in cave or island,\r\nwith the endurance of desolate and loveless days, with the repose of\r\nfolded hands that wait Heaven's time.\" The corresponding development in\r\nthe direction of greater naturalness which Giotto--himself a country\r\nlad brought up amongst the hills and fields--introduced in the art of\r\n_landscape_ painting cannot, unfortunately, be illustrated from the\r\nNational Gallery (see on this point Edinburgh _Lectures on Architecture\r\nand Painting_, ch. iii.). But a third development--the introduction,\r\nnamely, of _portraiture_--is well seen in the Heads of St. John and St.\r\nPaul (276), a work in which Giotto's influence is very marked. There\r\nis no longer a mere adoption of conventional types: these apostles\r\nare individual portraits. \"Before Cimabue, no beautiful rendering of\r\nhuman form was possible; and the rude or formal types of the Lombard\r\nand Byzantine, though they would serve in the tumult of the chase,\r\nor as the recognised symbols of creed, could not represent personal\r\nand domestic character. Faces with goggling eyes and rigid lips might\r\nbe endured, with ready help of imagination, for gods, angels, saints,\r\nor hunters--or for anybody else in scenes of recognised legend; but\r\nwould not serve for pleasant portraiture of one's own self, or of the\r\nincidents of gentle, actual life. And even Cimabue did not venture\r\nto leave the sphere of conventionally reverenced dignity. He still\r\npainted--though beautifully--only the Madonna, and the St. Joseph,\r\nand the Christ. These he made living--Florence asked no more: and\r\n'Credette Cimabue nella pintura tener lo campo.' But Giotto came from\r\nthe field; and saw with his simple eyes a lowlier worth. And he painted\r\nthe Madonna, and St. Joseph, and the Christ,--yes, by all means, if you\r\nchoose to call them so, but essentially,--Mamma, Papa, and the Baby.\r\nAnd all Italy threw up its cap--'ora ha Giotto il grido' (now Giotto\r\nhas the cry).\" A fourth development which the art of painting owes to\r\nGiotto may be well seen in this picture. Notice the pretty passages of\r\n_colour_, as, for instance, in the dresses of the angels. \"The Greeks\r\nhad painted anything anyhow,--gods black, horses red, lips and cheeks\r\nwhite; and when the Etruscan vase expanded into a Cimabue picture, or a\r\nTafi mosaic, still--except that the Madonna was to have a blue dress,\r\nand everything else as much gold on it as could be managed--there was\r\nvery little advance in notions of colour. Suddenly Giotto threw aside\r\nall the glitter, and all the conventionalism; and declared that he\r\nsaw the sky blue, the tablecloth white, and angels, when he dreamed\r\nof them, rosy. And he simply founded the schools of colour in Italy\"\r\n(_Mornings in Florence_, pt. ii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n569. AN ALTAR-PIECE.\r\n\r\n  _Orcagna_ (Florentine: about 1308-1386).\r\n\r\n      \"From the time of Giotto to the end of the 14th century Orcagna\r\n      stands quite pre-eminent even among the many excellent artists\r\n      of that time. In sculpture he was a pupil of Andrea Pisano;\r\n      in painting, though indirectly, a disciple of Giotto. Few\r\n      artists have practised with such success so many branches\r\n      of the arts. Orcagna was not only a painter and a sculptor,\r\n      but also a worker in mosaic, an architect and a poet. His\r\n      importance in the history of Italian art rests not merely\r\n      on his numerous and beautiful productions, but also on his\r\n      widespread influence, transmitted to his successors through\r\n      a large and carefully trained school of pupils. In style as a\r\n      painter Orcagna comes midway between Giotto and Fra Angelico;\r\n      he combined the dramatic force and realistic vigour of the\r\n      earlier painting with the pure brilliant colour and refined\r\n      unearthly beauty of Fra Angelico. His large fresco paintings\r\n      are works of extreme decorative beauty and splendour, composed\r\n      with careful reference to their architectural surroundings\"\r\n      (Middleton). His real name was Andrea di Cione, but he\r\n      was called by his contemporaries Orcagna, a corruption of\r\n      Arcagnuolo, the Archangel. \"An intense solemnity and energy\r\n      in the sublimest groups of his figures, fading away as he\r\n      touches inferior subjects, indicates that his home was among\r\n      the _archangels_, and his rank among the first of the sons\r\n      of men\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. iii. § 8).\r\n      Orcagna's father was a goldsmith, and the result of his early\r\n      training in the use of the precious metals may be traced in\r\n      the extreme delicacy and refined detail of his principal\r\n      works in sculpture. He used to note his union of the arts\r\n      by signing his pictures \"the work of ... sculptor,\" and his\r\n      sculptures \"the work of ... painter.\" As a sculptor and\r\n      architect, the principal work of Orcagna is the church of\r\n      Or San Michele at Florence. The great marble tabernacle is\r\n      \"one of the most important and beautiful works of art which\r\n      even Italy possesses.\" Vasari also attributes to his design\r\n      the Loggia dei Lanzi in the Piazza della Signoria, but this\r\n      attribution cannot be upheld. As a painter, the chief works\r\n      of Orcagna are the frescoes in the Strozzi chapel in S. Maria\r\n      Novella. The \"Paradise\" is the finest of these compositions--a\r\n      work full both of grace and of majesty. These frescoes were\r\n      executed in 1350. In 1357 Orcagna painted the altar-piece in\r\n      the same chapel, and of about the same date is the altar-piece\r\n      now before us. The grand frescoes in the Campo Santo at Pisa\r\n      ascribed by Vasari to Orcagna are now attributed to other hands.\r\n\r\n\"In San Piero Maggiore,\" says Vasari in his life of Orcagna, \"he\r\nexecuted a rather large picture, the 'Coronation of the Virgin.'\" This\r\nis the picture now before us. The principal portion is numbered 569.\r\nThe other nine pictures (570-578) were originally portions of the\r\nsame magnificent piece of decoration. A model of the church for which\r\nit was painted is held by St. Peter (among the saints adoring on the\r\nspectator's left). This altar-piece, though a handsome piece of church\r\nfurniture, is not so favourable a specimen of the master's power as\r\nare the works referred to above. Nevertheless these panels are full of\r\nvaried interest.\r\n\r\nA certain quaint uncouthness should not blind us to Orcagna's wealth\r\nof expressive detail. Thus, \"in the sensitive cast of the Mother's\r\ncountenance, and in the refined pose of her figure, there is a rare\r\ndegree of eloquence, such as silently bespeaks a modesty which would\r\nshun, a humility which would disallow, any sort of self-adornment.\r\nHer Lord, to whose will she submits herself, is no less monumental in\r\ndignity of combined power and tenderness. And in the celestial band\r\nbelow, in the maidens that play and sing at the Mother's feet, despite\r\ntheir quaint little almond eyes, there is a _naïveté_ of expression, a\r\nsimplicity and animation unequalled at so early a date. In particular\r\nshe who, singing behind the harpist, generously spends her soul in\r\nimpassioned songs, while others, agreeable to nature's truth, are\r\nsinging regardless of their song, interested only in what is around.\r\nAgain, in that dual company of holy men and women sitting about the\r\nthrone, reverence stills every feature, and a saintly singleness of\r\npurpose keeps each eye as they look in loving adoration on Him whose\r\ndying bought their soul's salvation, or as they lean towards Her\r\nwhose human heart petitioned them to Paradise\" (A. H. Macmurdo in\r\n_Century Guild Hobby Horse_, ii. 34). In the _Hobby Horse_ (a different\r\npublication, No. 1, 1893), a musical expert calls attention to the\r\ninstruments shown by Orcagna. Thus \"in the central compartment note the\r\nportative organ, at that time in familiar use, with its gimlet-shaped\r\nkeys all of one light colour, and apparently, even in that early date,\r\nchromatic in disposition. Five large drone pipes may be recognised,\r\nfrom their being out of scale with the melody pipes. The second\r\ninstrument in the angelic band is the mediæval harp, the comb holding\r\nthe wrest, or tuning, pins being held here in an animal's mouth. A\r\nthird angel is furnished with a cither, also a favourite mediæval\r\ninstrument. It is ornamented in ebony and ivory, and has a plectrum\r\nguard inserted in the belly, as in a modern mandoline. The fourth angel\r\nhas a viol of a clumsy form; it took another 200 years to arrive at the\r\ngraceful outline of the violin. The fifth has a psaltery. One angel has\r\na bagpipe; the chaunter or melody pipe has eight holes, the same number\r\nthe highland bagpipe has now.\" Variations of these instruments may be\r\nnoted in the subordinate pictures (A. J. Hipkins). An expert in another\r\nart calls attention to the beauty of the patterns on the dresses of the\r\ncentral figures, on the ground upon which the angels kneel and stand,\r\nand also on the stuff hung at the back of the throne (Sydney Vacher:\r\n_Italian Ornaments from brocades and stuffs found in pictures in the\r\nNational Gallery_).\r\n\r\n\r\n570-2. THE TRINITY, WITH ANGELS ADORING.\r\n\r\n_Orcagna_ (part of the altar-piece, 569).\r\n\r\nOne may notice here one of Orcagna's limitations. \"He was unable to\r\ndraw the nude. On this inability followed a coldness to the value of\r\nflowing lines, and to the power of unity in composition; neither could\r\nhe indicate motion or buoyancy in flying or floating figures\" (_On the\r\nOld Road_, i. § 78). Compare especially the flying angels in the two\r\nlittle pictures 571 and 572, with such figures as those by Botticelli\r\n(1034), and it will be seen at once how inferior Orcagna's knowledge\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\r\n573-5. THE NATIVITY, ADORATION, AND RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\n_Orcagna_ (part of the altar-piece, 569).\r\n\r\nThese panels are very rude and \"conventional\": nothing can be more\r\nabsurd, for instance, than the sleeping sheep and shepherds at the\r\ntop of the Nativity; but they are interesting, if only by comparison\r\nwith later pictures of the same subjects. Such a comparison shows\r\nhow constant the traditional ways of representing these events were,\r\nand how individual choice was shown in beautifying the traditions.\r\nFrom this point of view the Nativity is specially interesting. \"This\r\nbeautiful little picture,\" says Mr. Hodgson, R.A., \"is a good example\r\nof the simplest and most perfectly symbolical treatment of the subject.\r\nIn design and composition the painter has thought only how to convey\r\nthe story with the utmost clearness and simplicity. It is what it was\r\nintended to be, a Scripture story made visible to those who could not\r\nread. Naturalism, _i.e._ the actual representation of the aspect of\r\nnature, is not thought of, no more at least than was necessary to make\r\nthe meaning of the painted symbol equivalent to that of the word: rock\r\nfor rock, ox for ox, and ass for ass. The degree of naturalism aimed\r\nat in such scenes can be tested pretty accurately by the treatment of\r\nthe nimbus. A flat circular expanse of gold inserted into a picture\r\nmust necessarily be destructive of all illusion--it is treated as\r\na symbol, a thing non-existent, but as a necessary traditional\r\nobservance. When naturalism was aimed at, the nimbus was looked upon\r\nas an actual existing corona of golden light which the saint carried\r\nabout with him, and it was drawn in perspective, according to the\r\nturn of his head\" (_Magazine of Art_, 1890, p. 39). Turn next to the\r\nNativity by Piero della Francesca (908)--a picture painted 100 years\r\nlater. The symbolism is already mixed up with some conscious striving\r\nafter objects beautiful in themselves. To a generation later still\r\nbelongs Botticelli's \"Nativity\" (1034). It is full, as we shall see,\r\nof doctrinal symbolism, but it strikes the imagination also by the\r\npomp and pageantry of the angelic host, and appeals to the senses by\r\nits flowing lines and gorgeous colourings. Yet in all these pictures\r\nof the Nativity there are certain fixed elements. One feature never\r\nabsent is the introduction of the ox and the ass, suggested by a text\r\nfrom Habakkuk, iii. 4, \"He shall lie down between the ox and the ass.\"\r\nA second point is that Joseph \"sits apart, apparently weary or in\r\nmeditation. Great care seems to have been taken to suggest that he in\r\na certain sense held aloof, and was no participator in the interest\r\nof the scene; it was feared, perhaps, that were he to exhibit joy and\r\nsurprise, it might convey the idea of paternity; he is always a mere\r\nimpassive spectator.\" The scene of the Nativity is in the earliest\r\npictures always represented as a cavern; a grotto at Bethlehem is to\r\nthis day revered as the actual spot. In Margaritone's picture (564)\r\nwe have a bare cave in the rock. In Orcagna's the cave remains, but a\r\nwooden portico or shed is added to shelter the Virgin and her Child.\r\nNext the cave disappears altogether, but the shed remains (_e.g._ 908,\r\n1034).\r\n\r\nThe Adoration of the Magi (574) was a favourite subject with the\r\nItalian painters, for the three kings and their attendants gave them an\r\nexcuse for the most elaborate and picturesque detail. In the picture\r\nbefore us Orcagna was restricted by the size and shape of the panel;\r\nbut even making the necessary allowances on this score, we see that we\r\nhave here a relatively simple treatment of the theme. Orcagna finds\r\nroom, however, for \"a perfect menagerie. There are the sheep, with a\r\nhowling dog above; and below, an evil, badger-like dog, evidently much\r\nashamed of himself and his deeds, is sneaking along into a hole in the\r\nrock. As for the amiable ox sitting upon his haunches, with his tail\r\nturned round like a cat's, and the shy ass, showing the whites of his\r\neye: are they not delightful beauties?\" (_The Beasts of the National\r\nGallery_, by Sophia Beale, in _Good Words_, July 1895). For the rest,\r\nOrcagna's \"Adoration\" is limited to the necessary characters. By way\r\nof contrast, look at Filippino Lippi's (1033), in which some seventy\r\nfigures are introduced, and the whole picture is alive with gay\r\ncolours and picturesque incident. Other representations of the same\r\nsubject in our Gallery are by Fra Angelico (582), Foppa (729), Dossi\r\n(640), Peruzzi (167), and Veronese (268). A study of similarities and\r\ndifferences in these various examples will disclose an immense number\r\nof coincidences. The type survives, but each feature is the subject of\r\nelaborate variations.\r\n\r\n\r\n576. THE THREE MARIES AT THE SEPULCHRE.\r\n\r\n  _Orcagna_ (part of the altar-piece, 569).\r\n\r\nMary Magdalen, Mary the mother of James, and Salome stand beside the\r\nvacant tomb (Mark xvi. 1); on the opposite side are two angels: \"he\r\nis risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him.\" This\r\nsubject, common with the earliest painters, is afterwards seldom met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n577. THE ASCENSION.\r\n\r\n  _Orcagna_ (part of the altar-piece, 569).\r\n\r\nThis was a subject in which Giotto made a new departure. None of the\r\nByzantine or earliest Italian painters ventured to introduce the entire\r\nfigure of Christ in this scene. They showed the feet only, concealing\r\nthe body; according to the text, \"a cloud received Him out of their\r\nsight.\" This form of representation may be seen in some manuscripts in\r\nthe British Museum. In the Arena at Padua, Giotto broke away from this\r\ntradition and introduced the entire figure of Christ; succeeding also\r\nin conveying the idea of ascending motion very skilfully. Orcagna's\r\npicture is modelled on the new type fixed by Giotto.\r\n\r\n\r\n578. THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.\r\n\r\n  _Orcagna_ (part of the altar-piece, 569).\r\n\r\nThe descent of the Holy Spirit is represented above; and below, the\r\nmultitude confounded, every man hearing his own language.\r\n\r\n\r\n579. THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  School of _Taddeo Gaddi_ (Florentine: 1300-1366). _See_ 215.\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\nIn the centre is John the Baptist, baptizing Christ; on the left St.\r\nPeter, on the right St. Paul. In the pictures for the _predella_\r\n(the step on the top of the altar, thus forming the base of the\r\naltar-piece) is a saint at either end; and then, on the left, (1) the\r\nangel announcing the Baptist's birth, (2) his birth, (3) his death,\r\n(4) Herod's feast, and (5) Herodias with John the Baptist's head in a\r\ncharger. The picture must have been the work of an inferior scholar;\r\nbut it is interesting to notice that this attempt to tell a consecutive\r\nstory in his picture, as in an epic poem, instead of a fastening on\r\nsome one turning-point in it, as in a drama, is characteristic of\r\nearly art (see under 1188). Notice further in the central picture \"how\r\ndesignedly the fish in the water are arranged: not in groups, as chance\r\nmight rule in the actual stream, but in ordered procession. All great\r\nartists ... have shown this especial delight in ordering the relations\r\nof self-set details\" (A. H. Macmurdo in _Century Guild Hobby Horse_, i.\r\n71).\r\n\r\n\r\n579a. PARTS OF AN ALTAR-PIECE.\r\n\r\n  School of _Taddeo Gaddi_ (Florentine: 1300-1366). _See_ 215.\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\nThese three panels formed the _cuspidi_ of the Baptism of Christ (579).\r\nIn the centre is the Almighty, on the left the Virgin, on the right\r\nIsaiah, holding a scroll with the words (in Latin), \"Behold a virgin\r\nshall conceive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n580, 580a and b. THE ASCENSION OF ST. JOHN THE EVANGELIST.\r\n\r\n_Jacopo Landini_ (Florentine: about 1310-1390).\r\n\r\n      Jacopo Landini was born at Prato Vecchio, in the Casentino;\r\n      whence his common designation, Jacopo da Casentino. This\r\n      picture was formerly in the Church of St. John at the painter's\r\n      native place. He was a pupil of Taddeo Gaddi, and the master of\r\n      Spinello Aretino.\r\n\r\nAnother of the altar-pieces (_cf._ 579, above), which aimed at giving\r\nthe whole story of some subject, and thus recall the time when sacred\r\npictures were (as it has been put) a kind of \"Scripture _Graphic_.\"\r\nIn the _predella_ pictures (580_b_) are, on the left, (1) St. John\r\ndistributing alms and baptizing, (2) his vision of Revelation in the\r\nisland of Patmos, (3) his escape from the cauldron of boiling oil;\r\nand then, as the subject of the principal picture, his ascension to\r\nheaven, for, \"according to the Greek legend, St. John died without\r\npain or change, and immediately rose again in bodily form and ascended\r\ninto heaven to rejoin Christ and the Virgin.\" In the central picture,\r\nMr. Gilbert finds \"a glimpse of true landscape feeling in the brown\r\nplatform of rock, carefully gradated in aerial perspective, in the\r\ncolouring, coarse though it be, and especially in the long dark\r\nsea-line beyond\" (_Landscape in Art_, p. 184). In the other small\r\npictures and in the pilasters are various saints, and immediately over\r\nthe central picture are (1) the gates of hell cast down, (2) Christ\r\nrisen from the dead, (3) the donor of the picture and his family, being\r\npresented by the two St. Johns. Of the _cuspidi_, or upper pictures\r\n(580a), the centre piece is a symbolic representation of the Trinity\r\n(seen best on a large scale in 727); at the sides are the Virgin and\r\nthe Angel of the Annunciation, divided as explained under 1139.\r\n\r\n\r\n581. A GROUP OF SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Spinello Aretino_ (Tuscan: about 1333-1410).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      Spinello di Luca Spinelli is commonly called Spinello Aretino,\r\n      from Arezzo, his native town. As is the case with most of the\r\n      early Tuscan painters, he is seen to greater advantage in his\r\n      frescoes than in his panel pictures. Some fragments of frescoes\r\n      by him are in our Gallery (1216). Important frescoes may be\r\n      seen in the sacristy of S. Miniato above Florence (the life of\r\n      St. Benedict); in the Campo Santo at Pisa (the histories of SS.\r\n      Efeso and Potito); and in the Palazzo Pubblico at Siena (scenes\r\n      in the life of Pope Alexander III.). Spinello \"represents the\r\n      spirit of Giotto at the close of the fourteenth century better\r\n      than any other painter of the time.\" He belonged to a family\r\n      of goldsmiths. It is interesting to note on an altar-piece\r\n      executed by him for Monte Oliveto (now in the Gallery of\r\n      Siena), that the names of the carver and gilder of the frame\r\n      are inscribed as conspicuously as that of Spinello the painter\r\n      of the picture. He was the pupil of Jacopo di Casentino.\r\n\r\nCertainly not an adequate, and perhaps not an authentic, specimen\r\nof the master. The saints are St. John the Baptist, St. John the\r\nEvangelist, and St. James the Greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n582. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Fra Angelico_ (Florentine: 1387-1455). _See_ 663.\r\n\r\nFor the subject see notes on No. 574. Angelico's picture is remarkable\r\nfor the picturesque and sparkling costumes. \"The art of Angelico,\"\r\nsays Ruskin, \"both as a colourist and a draughtsman, is consummate; so\r\nperfect and beautiful, that his work may be recognised at any distance\r\nby the rainbow play and brilliancy of it. However closely it may be\r\nsurrounded by other works of the same school, glowing with enamel and\r\ngold, Angelico's may be told from them at a glance, like so many pieces\r\nof opal lying among common marbles\" (_Stones of Venice_, vol. i. app.\r\n15).\r\n\r\n\r\n683. THE ROUT OF SAN ROMANO.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Uccello_ (Florentine: 1397-1475).\r\n\r\n      This painter was originally brought up as a goldsmith, and\r\n      was one of the assistants of Lorenzo Ghiberti in preparing\r\n      the first pair of the celebrated gates of the Baptistery. It\r\n      is doubtful with whom he learnt to paint. He introduced new\r\n      enthusiasms and interests into the art, as explained below\r\n      in the notes on this picture. The majority of his works have\r\n      perished. He was employed principally in Florence, where\r\n      frescoes by him may be seen in one of the cloisters of S. Maria\r\n      Novella. At Padua he also executed some works which are said\r\n      by Vasari to have been greatly admired by Andrea Mantegna.\r\n      Other works by him are referred to below. The present picture\r\n      is, however, the most attractive of his extant productions. He\r\n      seems to have been a man of original character, and Vasari's\r\n      life of him is very good reading. The biographer's statement\r\n      about his poverty seems to be exaggerated, for documents exist\r\n      showing that he lived in a house which he had purchased.\r\n\r\nA picture of great interest in itself, both from a technical and from\r\na moral point of view, and also deserving of note in the history of\r\npainting. (1) It shows the beginning of scientific \"perspective\"\r\n(_i.e._ the science of representing the form and dimensions of things\r\nas they really _look_, instead of as we conceive them by touch or\r\nmeasurement to _be_); the painter is pleased with the new discovery,\r\nand sets himself, as it were, the hardest problem in perspective\r\nhe can find. Note the \"foreshortening\" of the figure on the ground\r\n(objects are said to be \"foreshortened\" when viewed so that we see\r\ntheir breadth, and not their length--for example, the leg of Titian's\r\nGanymede in No. 32). So devoted was Paolo to his science that he became\r\n(says Vasari) more needy than famous. His wife used to complain to her\r\nfriends that he sat up all night studying, and that the only answer she\r\never got to her remonstrances was, \"What a delightful thing is this\r\nperspective!\" The sculptor Donatello is also said to have remonstrated\r\nwith our painter: \"Ah, Paolo, with this perspective of thine, thou\r\nart leaving the substance for the shadow.\" Paolo was fond, too, of\r\ngeometry, which he read with Manetti. He had another and a softer\r\npassion: he was so fond of birds that he was called Paul of the Birds\r\n(\"Uccelli\"--his family name being Paolo di Dono), and he had numbers\r\nof painted birds, cats, and dogs in his house, being too poor to keep\r\nthe living creatures. (2) This picture is remarkable, secondly, as the\r\nearliest Italian work in the Gallery containing portraits, and the\r\nfirst which endeavours to represent a contemporary event.\r\n\r\nOur picture has hitherto been supposed to represent the battle of\r\nSant' Egidio (1417) in which Carlo Malatesta and his nephew Galeazzo\r\nwere taken prisoners by Braccio di Montone, lord of Perugia. Other\r\nbattle-pieces belonging to the same series are in the Uffizi and the\r\nLouvre respectively; and it has been shown by Mr. Herbert P. Horne\r\n(_Monthly Review_, October, 1901) that these are the three pictures\r\nof the \"Rout of San Romano,\" painted by Uccello for the palace of\r\nCosimo de' Medici, as described in an inventory of 1492. The principal\r\nfigure is Niccolo Maurucci da Tolentino, the leader of the Florentine\r\nforces, directing the attack against the Sienese at San Romano in 1432.\r\n\"He is represented on horseback fully armed, except for his helmet,\r\nwith the baton of command in his right hand. He wears on his head a\r\nrich _cappuccio_, or head-dress, of gold and purple damask; while his\r\nbascinet, covered with purple velvet, is carried by his helmet-bearer,\r\nwho rides by his side [the 'young Malatesta' of previous descriptions].\r\nAbove the figure of Tolentino waves his standard powdered with his\r\nimpress, the 'groppo di Salomone,' a knot of curious and intricate\r\nform, in a white field.\" The impress may be seen again, as Mr. Horne\r\npoints out, in the memorial portrait of Tolentino by Andrea del\r\nCastagno in the Cathedral of Florence.\r\n\r\nFrom the moral point of view, we may see in this picture, says Ruskin,\r\nwhat a gentleman's view of war is, as distinguished from a boor's,\r\nwith mean passion and low fury on every face. \"Look at the young\r\nMalatesta,[151] riding into the battle of Sant' Egidio. His uncle\r\nCarlo, the leader of the army, a grave man of about sixty, has just\r\ngiven orders for the knights to close: two have pushed forward with\r\nlowered lances, and the _mêlée_ has begun only a few yards in front;\r\nbut the young knight, riding at his uncle's side, has not put his\r\nhelmet on, nor intends doing so yet. Erect he sits, and quiet, waiting\r\nfor his captain's order to charge; calm as if he were at a hawking\r\nparty, only more grave; his golden hair wreathed about his proud white\r\nbrow, as about a statue's\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch.\r\nviii. § 9). Another point to notice is the type this picture affords\r\nof \"the neglect of the perfectness of the earth's beauty, by reason of\r\nthe passions of men. The armies meet on a country road beside a hedge\r\nof wild roses; the tender red flowers tossing above their helmets, and\r\nglowing between the lowered lances.\" In like manner, adds Ruskin, in\r\nthe Middle Ages, when men lived for safety in walled cities, \"the whole\r\nof Nature only shone for man between the tossing of helmet-crests; and\r\nsometimes I cannot but think of the trees of the earth as capable of a\r\nkind of sorrow, in that imperfect life of theirs, as they opened their\r\ninnocent leaves in the warm spring-time, in vain for men; and all along\r\nthe dells of England her beeches cast their dappled shade only where\r\nthe outlaw drew his bow, and the king rode his careless chase\" (_Modern\r\nPainters_, vol. v. pt. vi. ch. i. § 6).\r\n\r\n\r\n585. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Umbrian School_ (15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\nThis picture has been dethroned by Sir Edward Poynter from the high\r\nestate which it occupied in the catalogues of former directors, wherein\r\nit figured as a portrait by Piero della Francesca (see 665) of Isotta\r\ndi Rimini, the wife of Sigismondo Malatesta. Our portrait \"bears little\r\nresemblance,\" says the official catalogue, \"to the well-known medallion\r\nportraits of that lady by Matteo de' Pasti.\" It is, says Dr. Richter,\r\n\"an indifferent production, inferior to the master in outline, as well\r\nas in the execution of the ornamental parts. It may have been done\r\nby any forgotten painter of the time\" (_Italian Art in the National\r\nGallery_, p. 17). \"The curious stippled execution has little or nothing\r\nin common with the subtle technique of Piero\" (Claude Phillips in the\r\n_Academy_, September 28, 1889). It is, however, interesting for its\r\nstudy of fashions of the time. Notice the high forehead and the sleeves\r\nand ornaments of the lady's gown.\r\n\r\n\r\n586. MADONNA AND CHILD ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n  _Zenobio Macchiavelli_ (Florentine: 1418-1479).\r\n\r\n      This picture was formerly ascribed to Fra Filippo Lippi. It is\r\n      now given to Macchiavelli, who was a pupil of Benozzo Gozzoli,\r\n      and perhaps also of Lippi. A signed altar-piece by this painter\r\n      is in the Museo Civico at Pisa; another is in the Louvre; and\r\n      a third is in the National Gallery of Ireland. The latter is\r\n      \"a picture of singular interest,\" says the catalogue, \"proving\r\n      this master to have been one of the first of his time; full of\r\n      delicacy and refinement of feeling, and the heads beautifully\r\n      drawn.\"\r\n\r\n                Madonna and her babe,\r\n    Ringed by a bowery, flowery angel-brood\r\n    Lilies and vestments and white faces.\r\n\r\n      BROWNING: _Fra Lippo Lippi_.\r\n\r\nA characteristic production of a school which, \"orderly and obedient\r\nitself, understood the law of order in all things, which is the\r\nchief distinction between art and rudeness. And the first aim of\r\nevery great painter is to express clearly his obedience to the law\r\nof Kosmos, Order, or Symmetry\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1876, p. 292).\r\nThe four angel-faces on one side of the Madonna are matched by four\r\non the other; the bishop and black monk on one side-compartment, by\r\nthe saint and black nun on the other. Similarly at the foot of the\r\nthrone the two angels are arranged symmetrically, one facing one way,\r\nthe other the other. \"You will at first be pained by the decision of\r\nline, and, in the children at least, uncomeliness of feature, which\r\nare characteristic, the first, of purely descended Etruscan work; the\r\nsecond, of the Florentine School headed afterwards by Donatello. But\r\nit is absolutely necessary, for right progress in knowledge, that you\r\nbegin by observing and tracing decisive lines; and that you consider\r\ndignity and simplicity of expression more than beauty of feature\"\r\n(_Fors Clavigera_, 1875, p. 308).\r\n\r\n\r\n589. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Fra Filippo Lippi_ (Florentine: about 1406-1469). _See_ 666.\r\n\r\nCombined with Lippi's realism of representation, \"there is also an\r\nunusually mystic spiritualism of conception. Nearly all the Madonnas,\r\neven of the most strictly devotional schools, themselves support the\r\nchild, either on their knees or in their arms. But here the Christ is\r\nmiraculously borne by an angel\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1875, p. 308).\r\n\r\n\r\n590. A PIETÀ.\r\n\r\n  _Marco Zoppo_ (Bolognese; painted 1471-1498).\r\n\r\n      This unattractive painter was born in Bologna, and became a\r\n      pupil in the school of Squarcione at Padua. His work shows also\r\n      the influence of Cosimo Tura at Florence.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the various representations of the Dead\r\nChrist, or Pietà, which may be seen in the National Gallery. The\r\nsubject, it may first be noted, was treated in very different ways.\r\n\"Convention did not early harden down into fixity of composition or\r\ncrystallise into rigid forms. A certain plasticity of imagination was\r\npermitted from the beginning; a certain indefiniteness of nomenclature\r\nand scope remained habitual to the end\" (Grant Allen: see also Mrs.\r\nJameson's _History of our Lord_, ii. 226). Sometimes the subject of\r\nthe \"Pietà\" is the Mater Dolorosa, weeping over the body of the dead\r\nSaviour, and attended by saints (266, 1427) or angels (180). At other\r\ntimes the dead Saviour is supported by angels only (22, 219, 602), or,\r\nas in this picture, by saints. Sometimes the dead figure is represented\r\nlying at full length (22, 180); at other times it is a half-figure\r\nshowing above a tomb or ledge (219, 266, 602, 590, 1427). Still more\r\ninteresting is a comparison between these pictures for the illustration\r\nit gives of the different sentiment of different painters or schools.\r\nThe picture before us is hard and dry; that of Crivelli (602) is full\r\nof tenderness. With some painters it is the physical horror, the bodily\r\ndistortion that appeals to them in this subject. With others it is the\r\npity and the sorrow (as, pre-eminently, in Francia's, 180).\r\n\r\n\r\n591. THE RAPE OF HELEN.\r\n\r\n  _Benozzo Gozzoli_ (Florentine: 1420-1498). _See_ 283.\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\nThe earliest picture in the Gallery which was painted for domestic\r\npleasure, not religious service. One of the earliest also in which a\r\nclassical subject is attempted. It probably formed the end of a coffer\r\nor _cassone_,[152] such as were often given for wedding presents, and\r\nwas no doubt a commission to the artist for that purpose. Hence the\r\nchoice of subject (which has been variously given as the Rape of Helen\r\nand the Rape of the Venetian Brides), and the (surely intentional)\r\ncomic extravagance of the drawing: the bridegroom takes giant's strides\r\nin lover's eagerness, and the ships scud along with love to speed them.\r\nThe ludicrous unreality of the rocks and trees, contrasted with the\r\nbeautifully painted flowers of the foreground, is very characteristic\r\nof the art of the time (_cf._ 283 and 582). Rocks, trees, and water are\r\nall purely \"conventional\" still; and \"the most satisfactory work of the\r\nperiod is that which most resembles missal painting, that is to say,\r\nwhich is fullest of beautiful flowers and animals scattered among the\r\nlandscape, in the old independent way, like the birds upon a screen.\r\nThe landscape of Benozzo Gozzoli is exquisitely rich in incident of\r\nthis kind\" (Edinburgh _Lectures on Architecture and Painting_, ch.\r\niii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n592. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Filippino Lippi_[153] (Florentine: 1457-1504). _See_ 293.\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\nThis picture, with its immense retinue of followers, is \"full of life\r\nand swarms with incident and expression, from the dignified gravity of\r\nSt. Joseph to the fantastic humour of the dwarf. No two figures are\r\nalike, except perhaps the two shepherds who are approaching from the\r\nright, and they are different from all the rest\" (Monkhouse).\r\n\r\n\r\n593. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo di Credi_ (Florentine: 1459-1537).\r\n\r\n      Lorenzo di Andrea Credi has been called by Morelli the Carlo\r\n      Dolci of the fifteenth century. His pictures are sweet and\r\n      gentle, but lack force or inspiration. His colouring tends\r\n      towards crudeness; his careful execution and finish are\r\n      remarkable. \"He was a very careful and laborious workman,\r\n      distilling his own oils and grinding his own colours; and when\r\n      he was working he would suffer no movement to be made,\" says\r\n      Vasari, \"that would cause dust to settle on his pictures.\"\r\n      What Vasari adds about him may be partly seen in this and the\r\n      companion picture (648), with their bright colouring and pretty\r\n      distances: \"His works were finished with so much delicacy\r\n      that every other painting looks but just sketched and left\r\n      incomplete as compared with those from his hand.\" Lorenzo\r\n      was the son and grandson of goldsmiths, and was placed when\r\n      quite a child under the tuition of Verocchio (296), and was\r\n      still working under him at the age of twenty-one, content with\r\n      the modest salary of one florin (about £2) a month. Like his\r\n      master, he was a sculptor as well as a painter, and Verocchio\r\n      in his will requested that Lorenzo might finish his famous\r\n      statue (at Venice) of Bartolommeo Colleoni. (The Venetians,\r\n      however, gave it to Alessandro Leopardo to finish.) Lorenzo was\r\n      one of the few men who lived through the Renaissance without\r\n      swerving from the religious traditions of earlier art, and even\r\n      without being much influenced by his fellow-pupils--though in\r\n      his grave and sweet Madonnas there is yet a suspicion of the\r\n      sidelong look, half sweet, half sinister, and of the long,\r\n      oval face, which distinguish Leonardo. He was a disciple of\r\n      Savonarola, and burnt his share of pictures in the famous\r\n      bonfire. \"His will bears witness to his contrition. After\r\n      having assured the future of his old woman-servant, to whom\r\n      he left his bedding and an annuity in kind; after having made\r\n      certain donations to his niece and to the daughter of a friend,\r\n      a goldsmith; he directed that the rest of his fortune should go\r\n      to the brotherhood of the indigent poor, and that his obsequies\r\n      should be as simple as possible\" (Müntz: _Leonardo da Vinci_,\r\n      i. 29). Lorenzo is not represented so well in the National\r\n      Gallery as in the Louvre and at Florence. His \"Nativity\" in\r\n      the Florentine Academy is perhaps his best work. Lorenzo's\r\n      range was limited, and \"Holy Conversations\" or \"Madonnas\" were\r\n      his most frequent subjects. A peculiarity of them is the large\r\n      head and somewhat puffy and clumsy forms he gives to the Infant\r\n      Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n594. THE \"HOLY MONEY-DESPISERS.\"\r\n\r\n  _Emmanuel_ (Byzantine: about 1660).\r\n\r\nThis picture is the earliest in the Gallery (with the exception of\r\nthe Greek portraits, see 1260)--not in order of time, but in order of\r\nartistic development. It is a genuine Byzantine picture, an example,\r\ntherefore, of the art which prevailed in Italy from the sixth century\r\ndown to about 1250, and the influence of which survived even when the\r\nItalian painters had developed an art of their own. The Byzantine style\r\nof painting is distinguished by its conventionality and its constancy.\r\nIt was the recognised thing that such and such a subject should be\r\ntreated in such and such a way and no other. There is a Byzantine\r\nManual of Painting in a manuscript of the eleventh century in which\r\ninstructions are given not only as to the subjects to be represented,\r\nbut as to the costume, age, and lineaments of the characters. An art\r\nof this kind was naturally unchanging. This picture is probably only\r\n200 years old, but if it had been painted 800 years ago, or if it had\r\nbeen ordered only the other day from the monks of Mount Athos, little\r\ndifference of style would be perceptible. It is signed in Greek \"The\r\nhand of Emmanouel, the priest, son of John,\" a painter living in Venice\r\nabout the year 1660.\r\n\r\nThe picture is conventional in its choice of subject--the saints Cosmas\r\nand Damian being one of the subjects recognised in Byzantine art.\r\nThey were martyrs of the fourth century--patron saints of medicine,\r\nwhich they practised without fees--hence their title, the \"holy\r\nmoney-despisers.\" They are here receiving the Divine blessing. The\r\npicture is conventional also in its treatment. Thus the attitude of\r\nthe hand is the recognised symbol whereby to express that a figure is\r\nspeaking. So, too, the background is formed by a golden plain, which\r\nis meant to represent the air or the sky. The dark blue semicircle\r\nsurrounding the bust of our Saviour, above the two heads of the saints,\r\nhas more or less the form of the horizon, and is meant to represent the\r\nheaven in which Christ dwells (Richter's _Italian Art_, etc., pp. 5-7).\r\n\r\n\r\n595. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Venetian School: 15th-16th century).\r\n\r\nOne of the many pictures in the Gallery from which the so-called\r\n\"æsthetic\" or \"high art\" gowns of the present day have been copied.\r\nFormerly ascribed to Battista Zelotti, a disciple of Paul Veronese.\r\n\r\n\r\n596. THE ENTOMBMENT OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Marco Palmezzano_ (Umbrian: 1456-1537).\r\n\r\n      This painter was a fellow-countryman and pupil of Melozzo of\r\n      Forli, who studied under Piero della Francesca, and to that\r\n      extent Marco is a member of the Umbrian School. Like his\r\n      master, Marco studied geometry and perspective. He was skilful\r\n      in perspective, \"but he scarcely ever ridded himself of a\r\n      certain dryness and hardness, and his draperies are in general\r\n      angular in the folds, cutting up instead of indicating the\r\n      forms beneath\" (Burton). His pictures abound in Forli.\r\n\r\nThis picture, originally of a semicircular shape, was the lunette of\r\nan altar-piece, painted in 1506 for the Cathedral of Forli, and now in\r\nthe Gallery of that town. To the spectator's right is San Mercuriale,\r\nfirst bishop of Forli, holding the Guelphic banner of the church; on\r\nthe left, San Valeriano with the standard of Forli.\r\n\r\n\r\n597. \"ST. VINCENTIUS FERRER.\"\r\n\r\n  _Francesco del Cossa_ (Ferrarese: about 1435-1485).\r\n\r\n      Cossa was a contemporary of Cosimo Tura (772), with whom\r\n      he exhibits close affinities of style. \"But while Tura was\r\n      fantastic, and inclined to the lavish use of decoration,\r\n      Cossa, with severer views of his art, sought to give dignity\r\n      and grandeur to his figures, and kept ornamentation within its\r\n      proper bounds\" (Official Catalogue). \"It may be added that\r\n      Cossa, though 'severer' in one sense, viz. that he saw more\r\n      clearly and kept more strictly within the true limits of fine\r\n      art, had more amenity than Tura; his decorative instinct was\r\n      more refined, his sense of grace less crude. He was also a\r\n      sweeter, finer, colourist\" (Monkhouse). Cossa worked at Ferrara\r\n      with other artists for Duke Borso, and among other works he\r\n      executed some of the frescoes for the Schifanoia Palace. These\r\n      have been copied by the Arundel Society. In 1470 Cossa removed\r\n      to Bologna, where his best works are to be seen. The finest\r\n      of them is the \"Virgin and Child with St. Petronius\" in the\r\n      Pinacoteca--\"a work of singular grandeur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our beautiful panel is, for its size, as characteristic and fine a\r\nspecimen of the master as exists. The painting throughout is of fine\r\nquality, the modelling and expression of the head admirable, the colour\r\nstrong and fine, but soft withal, and the abundant detail executed\r\nwith great skill and patience, but kept in due subordination. The\r\nstrange background, with its fantastic erections, half architecture\r\nhalf rock, is of less beauty, but equally characteristic of the\r\nartist\" (Monkhouse: _In the National Gallery_, p. 167). The picture,\r\nonce ascribed to Marco Zoppo, has been now recognised as the central\r\npanel of an altar-piece by Cossa, of which the wings are in the Brera\r\nat Milan, and the predella is in the Picture Gallery of the Vatican.\r\nThe Dominican represented has at various times been supposed to be\r\nSt. Dominic himself, St. Vincentius Ferrer, and St. Hyacinth. The\r\npredella pictures are of scenes in the life of St. Hyacinth, who\r\ntherefore is probably the subject of our panel also. He was a member\r\nof the Dominican Order (whose habit he wears), a Pole by birth, and a\r\nmissionary in Russia. St. Vincentius Ferrer was a Spaniard of Valencia,\r\nwho in 1374, at the age of 17, entered the Dominican Order, died in\r\n1419, and was canonised in 1455.\r\n\r\n\r\n598. ST. FRANCIS WITH THE \"STIGMATA.\"\r\n\r\n  _Filippino Lippi_ (Florentine: 1457-1504). _See 293._\r\n\r\n      St. Francis, the founder of the Franciscan Order of monks (the\r\n      Black Friars), was the great apostle of Works, whilst St.\r\n      Dominic, the founder of the Dominican Order (White Friars),\r\n      was the great apostle of Faith. It was the teaching of these\r\n      two orders that gave the impetus to the church building, from\r\n      which grew the art revival at Florence in the thirteenth\r\n      century. \"The gospel of works, according to St. Francis, lay\r\n      in three things. You must work without money, and be poor.\r\n      You must work without pleasure, and be chaste. You must work\r\n      according to orders, and be obedient.\" And so truly did he in\r\n      his own works exemplify the life of Christ, that, according to\r\n      the legend of the time, he received also in his own person the\r\n      wounds (or \"stigmata\") of the Crucified One--here visible on\r\n      his hands. (\"Take my yoke upon you\"; or \"Take up the cross and\r\n      follow me.\") \"His reception of the 'stigmata' is, perhaps, a\r\n      marvellous instance of the power of imagination over physical\r\n      conditions; perhaps an equally marvellous instance of the\r\n      swift change of metaphor into tradition; but assuredly, and\r\n      beyond dispute, one of the most influential, significant, and\r\n      instructive traditions possessed by the Church of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nThe saint is here represented in glory; choirs of singing angels\r\nencompass him; for now \"the wounds of his Master are his inheritance,\r\nthe cross--sign not of triumph, but of trial, is his reward\" (_Mornings\r\nin Florence_, i. 8, 13; iii. 64). Inscribed on the picture below are\r\nsome lines from a Latin hymn to St. Francis, exhorting others to follow\r\nhim, and to advance as he did the standards of their king (\"Let those\r\nwho depart out of Egypt follow him, and be united to him, in whom the\r\nstandards of the King come forth for us in clear light\").\r\n\r\nThe floating angels recall those by Botticelli, but the pupil's work\r\nis not here so good: these angels seem after all to be standing,\r\nBotticelli's to be indeed floating in thin air. Lippi, too, learnt\r\nno doubt from him the goldsmith's work, seen here in the indented\r\nbackground to the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n599. THE MADONNA OF THE MEADOW.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_ (Venetian: 1426-1516). _See 189._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\nA very charming little picture, marred only by a certain insipidity\r\nin the expression of the Madonna--which contrasts markedly alike with\r\nthe pathetic type of Bellini's early Madonnas (_e.g._ No. 288), and\r\nwith the more stately type which he afterwards adopted (as in the\r\naltar-piece in the Academy at Venice). \"The landscape is altogether\r\ninteresting, and will well repay a long examination. The incident of\r\nthe bird and the serpent should not be missed, and the Eastern sheep\r\nwith the long ears and its stately attendant in the white burnous\r\nshould be noted as an attempt to give some Oriental character to the\r\nscene\" (Monkhouse: _In the National Gallery_, p. 220). \"The exquisite\r\nopaline purity of its daylight, the delicacy and finish of every\r\ndetail, the walls and towers of the little town serene in the rays of\r\nmorning, and the mountain ranges, pure and lovely in definition--all\r\nthese graces make the picture one of the joys of art\" (Gilbert's\r\n_Landscape in Art_, p. 330).\r\n\r\nThis picture has at different times been given several different\r\nattributions, of which the most cautious was \"School of Bellini.\" In\r\nearlier editions of the Official Catalogue it was ascribed to Basaiti\r\n(see 281); but now (1898) to Bellini. Sir Edward Poynter refers in\r\nsupport of this alteration to the close resemblance of the present\r\npicture to a signed work by Bellini in the Giovanelli Palace at\r\nVenice, and, as regards the background, to No. 812 in our gallery.\r\nSir Walter Armstrong (_Notes on the National Gallery_, p. 24) draws\r\nattention to the similarity in the baby's hands here and in 224, and\r\nwould ascribe both pictures to Catena. The correct settlement of\r\ndisputed points of attribution like this is highly important for the\r\nhistory of painting, but meanwhile the very fact of such disputes has\r\na useful significance, as showing what is meant by the old \"schools\"\r\nof painting. Individual peculiarities are only discovered by minutest\r\nexaminations; but beneath such differences there are in each school\r\nsimilarities of treatment and conception which come from common\r\ntraditions and common teaching, and which cause critics of equal\r\nintelligence to attribute the same pictures to different masters of the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n600. THE BLIND BEGGAR.\r\n\r\n  _J. L. Dyckmans_ (Flemish: 1811-1888).\r\n\r\n      Josef Laurens Dyckmans, a pupil of Wappers, was for some time\r\n      Professor of the Academy of Painting at Antwerp.\r\n\r\n\"A blind old man is standing in the sunshine by a church door: before\r\nhim is a young girl, who is holding out her hand for alms to the\r\npassers-by; an old lady coming from the church is feeling in her pocket\r\nfor a sou; some other figures are seen in the porch at their devotions\r\nbefore a crucifix. Painted at Antwerp, signed _J. Dyckmans_, 1853\"\r\n(Official Catalogue). \"The picture is painted in a tone of colour\r\nexceedingly low, but the whole is worked to an extreme finish; the\r\nheads in fact are elaborated with a care such as Denner's pictures\r\nshow. In these days of light and glowing harmonies the eye is at once\r\nstruck with the abstinence from colour which the artist has made a\r\ncardinal principle in the execution of his work\" (_Art Journal_, July\r\n1864). This picture was presented by Miss Jane Clark, who paid 900\r\nguineas for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n602. A \"PIETÀ.\"\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Crivelli_ (Venetian: painted 1468-1493).\r\n\r\n      Crivelli is one of the most individual of painters, and no\r\n      collection is so rich in his works as the National Gallery. He\r\n      was a native of Venice, and his work shows marked affinities\r\n      with the school of Padua. Of his life, little is known except\r\n      that in, or shortly before, the year 1468 he settled at Ascoli\r\n      in the Marches of Ancona. In that neighbourhood he seems to\r\n      have spent the rest of his life, in the employment mainly\r\n      of various religious fraternities. He thus lived somewhat\r\n      outside the artistic world of his time, a fact which serves\r\n      to explain the rather conservative character of his art.\r\n      Thus he adhered to the _tempera_ medium. He adhered also to\r\n      the Byzantine traditions of the old Venetian School with its\r\n      fondness for the \"ancona,\" or altar-piece consisting of many\r\n      single figures each in its separate compartment, and for gilt\r\n      and silvered ornaments in high relief. There is, too, a vein\r\n      of affectation in his pictures which contrasts strongly with\r\n      the naturalistic tendency in contemporary Venetian art. Owing\r\n      to a little touch of vanity in the painter we are able to date\r\n      many of his pictures. For it is known that he was knighted in\r\n      1490, and so proud was \"Sir Charles\" of his new honour that he\r\n      signed all subsequent pictures \"Carlo Crivelli, Knight.\" No.\r\n      724 is probably the first he finished after the reception of\r\n      the coveted honour. His love of accessories, and especially\r\n      of fruit, will strike every visitor; and so also will the\r\n      brilliance of his colouring and the unerring, if somewhat\r\n      harsh, exactness of his outlines. For tender pathos the present\r\n      picture is remarkable. His range was, as we shall see, somewhat\r\n      limited. He seldom attempted compositions on any large scale,\r\n      and his subject pictures are few: No. 739 is one of the best\r\n      of them. He excelled rather in single figures, and in these\r\n      we find expressed, \"in quaint combination, morose asceticism,\r\n      passionate and demonstrative grief, verging on caricature,\r\n      occasional grandeur of conception and presentment, knightly\r\n      dignity, feminine sweetness and tenderness mingled with demure\r\n      and far-fetched grace\" (Sir F. Burton). Up to the end of the\r\n      eighteenth century Crivelli's works were still to be found in\r\n      their original places, in the churches and convents of Eastern\r\n      Italy, where they attracted little attention. The suppression\r\n      of the convents after the age of the Revolution brought them\r\n      into notice, and English collectors purchased them in large\r\n      numbers. In recent years this appreciation has steadily\r\n      increased. The large altar-piece, 788, was bought in 1868 for\r\n      £3360. At the Dudley sale in 1892, the altar-piece, now in the\r\n      Berlin Museum, fetched £7350.\r\n\r\nThis little picture is part of an altar-piece formerly in a church at\r\nMonte Fiore, near Fermo: other portions are at Brussels. The picture is\r\nsigned, but not dated; the piece of red watered silk which hangs over\r\nthe edge of the tomb is characteristic of Crivelli's earlier period.\r\nIts prettily pathetic sentiment and brilliant tone make it one of the\r\npainter's most attractive works. For some remarks on the subject, see\r\nunder 590.\r\n\r\n\r\n621. THE HORSE FAIR.\r\n\r\n  _Rosa Bonheur_ (French: 1822-1899).\r\n\r\n      Mdlle. Rosalie Bonheur, usually called Rosa Bonheur, the most\r\n      vigorous and spirited of French animal painters, was born at\r\n      Bordeaux. Her parents had a sharp struggle for existence. Her\r\n      mother taught music; her father--Raymond Bonheur--drawing. He\r\n      was a painter of some ability, and all the children inherited\r\n      an artistic bent. When the family removed to Paris, Rosa's\r\n      precocious talents rapidly developed. They lived next door\r\n      to a tavern which was a house of call for diligences and\r\n      market-waggons, and there she found inexhaustible material\r\n      for animal studies. Her brother, Auguste, became an animal\r\n      and landscape painter of repute; another brother, Isidore,\r\n      an animal sculptor; her sister, Juliette, who married M.\r\n      Peyrol, was also a well-known painter. In the Salon of 1848\r\n      the whole family exhibited. From the common purse, when they\r\n      were children, a goat was bought for a model, which they used\r\n      to carry up to their humble studio. Another place of study\r\n      with Rosa Bonheur was the Abattoir du Roule, \"where, with\r\n      characteristic fortitude, she not only controlled her natural\r\n      repugnance to scenes of slaughter, but overcame all the disgust\r\n      which attended the 'brutalité grossière' of the people employed\r\n      there. Even at this early period she studied not only the\r\n      outward aspects and anatomical construction of the creatures\r\n      she painted, but their passions and tempers. Among the friends\r\n      to whom she always referred with grateful pleasure as helpful\r\n      in these days was Paul Delaroche, who called at the humble\r\n      family quarters on a sixth floor, and was not sparing in his\r\n      admiration.\" Rosa had first been apprenticed to a dressmaker,\r\n      but her love of art impelled her to give up this occupation,\r\n      and she succeeded in contributing to the family exchequer by\r\n      the sale of copies made in the Louvre. In 1841, when only 19,\r\n      she exhibited two pictures in the Salon. Her mother died in\r\n      1833, and in 1845 her father married again; from that time\r\n      forward she lived an independent life. Her famous \"Labourage\r\n      Nivernais,\" now in the Luxembourg, was painted in 1848. This\r\n      greatly increased her reputation, and she was able to secure\r\n      for her father the post of director of the Women's Painting\r\n      School, established by the Government in Paris. His death\r\n      in the following year affected her greatly, and she did not\r\n      exhibit again until 1853, when \"The Horse Fair,\" _Le Marché\r\n      aux Chevaux_, appeared. Through engravings and photographs\r\n      this work made the name of Rosa Bonheur famous throughout the\r\n      world. She visited Spain and Scotland, and painted pictures of\r\n      both those countries. Her permanent residence was an estate\r\n      at By in the forest of Fontainebleau, which she purchased in\r\n      1855. There ten years later she was personally invested by the\r\n      Emperor of the French with the Cross of the Legion of Honour,\r\n      an honour confirmed in later years by President Carnot. A\r\n      still higher compliment was paid her in 1870-1871, when her\r\n      studio and residence were spared from any intrusion, by the\r\n      special order of Prince Frederick Charles. For many years she\r\n      regularly attended horse fairs both in France--such as she has\r\n      here depicted--and abroad, adopting as a rule men's costume in\r\n      order to carry out her studies and purchases without attracting\r\n      attention. Mr. Frith relates how when he and Sir John Millais\r\n      went to lunch with her in 1858, they were met at the station by\r\n      a carriage, the coachman appearing to be a French Abbé. \"The\r\n      driver wore a black broad-brimmed hat and black cloak, long\r\n      white hair with a cheery rosy face. It was Rosa Bonheur, who\r\n      lives at her château with a lady companion, and others in the\r\n      form of boars, lions, and deer, who serve as models.\" Gambart,\r\n      who was of the party, \"repeated to her some words of praise\r\n      given by Landseer to a picture of hers, then exhibiting in\r\n      London. Her eyes filled with tears as she listened.\" \"When one\r\n      sees this young artist,\" wrote a journalist in 1852, \"small of\r\n      stature and of delicate appearance, standing by a huge canvas,\r\n      he would be tempted to think that her powers had not attained\r\n      the full height of their ambition; but when he comes to make\r\n      note of the straight, resolute lines of the artist's features,\r\n      her full square forehead, her thick hair, cut as short as that\r\n      of a man, and her dark, quick flashing eyes, he ceases to\r\n      fear. He then realises that it is not reckless audacity which\r\n      impels her forward in her work, but a greatness of soul and a\r\n      consciousness of her strength.\" \"Few artistic careers,\" says\r\n      her brother-in-law, \"have been more active, more brilliant, or\r\n      more characterised by simple and quiet dignity, or perhaps, on\r\n      the whole, more happy. Having known during her youngest days\r\n      the terrible inconvenience of poverty, Rosa Bonheur raised\r\n      herself, by her talent alone, to a position of independence\r\n      and fortune. She was privileged to enjoy at the same time\r\n      the charms of fame and the sweets of obscurity.\" She never\r\n      abandoned the retired habits of life she loved, and she was\r\n      able to continue her studies to the end.\r\n\r\n\"The magnificent stallions with their powerful forms pass before us\r\nat a trot, kicking up the dust under their feet. Full of life and\r\nmovement, and thoroughly imbued with realism, but of a beautiful and\r\nnoble realism. The composition is admirable, and brings out finely the\r\nenergy and spirit of the horse. The scene represents the horses as\r\nhaving just reached the market, and as being in the act of falling back\r\nto re-form for their proper places. The fine trees in the background\r\nof the picture, under which, upon a rising ground, the dealers and\r\nbuyers take up their position, are obscured on the left by the haze,\r\nand by the clouds of dust raised by the trotting horses; in the\r\nbackground, too, at the extreme left, is seen the small dome of the\r\nSalpêtrière. The _Marché aux Chevaux_ of Paris was at that time situate\r\nin the Boulevard l'Hôpital, not far from the Orleans railway; but in\r\nconsequence of changes, the market has lost the picturesque aspect it\r\nwore in 1853. One looks in vain now for the large trees which then\r\nshadowed it, and the bold earth, covered in places by short dusty\r\ngrass and broken up by the trampling of the horses.... A mingling of\r\nart and truth is very obvious in 'The Horse Fair.' The irregular order\r\nof the horses, their different movements bringing into play all their\r\nmuscles; the different spots of their coats, so disposed as to set off\r\none another, and furnishing at the same time a charming variety to the\r\neye; the powerful dappled Perche horses, which pass in the foreground\r\nand constitute the centre of the picture, with the groups of black[154]\r\nand white horses which rear themselves up on their hind feet--all this\r\nshows a profoundly skilful arrangement, and results in a grand and\r\nharmonious _ensemble_. Yet the first impression which this picture\r\ngives is that of a scene taken from the life, and of intense realism.\r\nThe freedom and breadth of the execution are equal to the beauty of\r\nthe composition. The vigorous touch, and the powerful drawing also\r\nhelp to give this picture a spirited character and masculine vigour in\r\nperfect harmony with the subject it represents\" (René Peyrol in the\r\n_Art Annual_ on Rosa Bonheur). Ruskin, while bearing his testimony to\r\nthe artist's power, calls attention to \"one stern fact concerning art\"\r\nwhich here detracts from her full success. \"No painter of animals ever\r\nyet was entirely great, who shrank from painting the human face; and\r\nMdlle. Bonheur _does_ shrink from it.... In the 'Horse Fair,' the human\r\nfaces are nearly all dexterously, but disagreeably, hidden, and the one\r\nclearly shown has not the slightest character. Mdlle. Bonheur may rely\r\nupon this, that if she cannot paint a man's face, she can neither paint\r\na horse's, a dog's, nor a bull's. There is in every animal's eye a dim\r\nimage and gleam of humanity, a flash of strange light through which\r\ntheir life looks out and up to our great mystery of command over them,\r\nand claims the fellowship of the creature, if not of the soul.[155]\r\nI assure Mdlle. Bonheur, strange as the words may sound to her, after\r\nwhat she has been told by huntsmen and racers, she has never painted a\r\nhorse yet. She has only painted trotting bodies of horses\" (_Academy\r\nNotes, etc._ 1858, p. 32).\r\n\r\nThe original of this famous composition--probably the best-known and\r\nmost popular animal picture of our epoch--was exhibited in the Salon\r\nin 1853. The painter had been engaged on it for a long time, and had\r\nmade innumerable studies for it. She used to call it \"her Parthenon\r\nFrieze.\" It was sold to Mr. Gambart, the picture-dealer, who brought it\r\nto England. It made a great sensation in London, and afterwards went\r\non a provincial tour. It then travelled to America where it was sold,\r\nand is now in the New York Museum. Rosa Bonheur painted for Gambart two\r\nrepetitions of it on a smaller scale. One of these, the picture before\r\nus, was bought by Mr. Jacob Bell, who bequeathed it to the nation in\r\n1859. It was the first work by a living foreign painter to be admitted\r\nto the Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n623. MADONNA AND CHILD ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n  _Girolamo da Treviso_ (Venetian: 1497-1544).\r\n\r\n      Girolamo, the son and pupil of Piermaria Pennachi, was born\r\n      at Treviso. He painted at Venice, Genoa, Trent, Faenza, and\r\n      Bologna, at which latter place several of his frescoes and\r\n      paintings remain. Between the years 1535 and 1538 he returned\r\n      to Venice and became intimate with Titian, Sansovino, and\r\n      Aretino. \"In 1542,\" says Vasari, \"he repaired to England, where\r\n      he was so favoured by certain of his friends, who recommended\r\n      him to the king (Henry VIII.), that he was at once appointed to\r\n      the service of that monarch. Presenting himself to the English\r\n      sovereign accordingly, Girolamo was employed, not as painter,\r\n      but as engineer, and having given proofs of his ability in\r\n      various edifices, copied from such as he had seen in Tuscany\r\n      and other parts of Italy, the king admired them greatly.\r\n      Nay, furthermore, his majesty rewarded the master with large\r\n      gifts, and ordained him a stipend of four hundred crowns a\r\n      year, giving him at the same time opportunity and permission\r\n      to erect an honourable abode for himself, the cost of which\r\n      was borne by the king.\" Girolamo had, however, to erect also\r\n      some bastions at Boulogne, and there \"he was struck by a\r\n      cannon-ball, which came with such violence that it cut him in\r\n      two as he sat on his horse. And so were his life and all the\r\n      honours of this world extinguished together, all his greatness\r\n      departing in a moment.\" His works are now scarce. No. 218 in\r\n      this gallery may be the copy made by Girolamo from Peruzzi's\r\n      drawing, No. 167.\r\n\r\nThis picture, formerly the altar-piece of the Boccaferri chapel in\r\nS. Domenico at Bologna, is signed by the painter and is mentioned by\r\nVasari (iii. 287) as \"the best of his works: it represents the Madonna\r\nwith numerous saints (Joseph, James, and Paul), and contains the\r\nportrait of the person by whom the painter was commissioned to execute\r\nthe work.\" Girolamo, who, as we have seen, was a man of travel, \"did\r\nnot remain faithful to the tradition of art as professed at Venice\r\nand Treviso, and might be called rather a forerunner of the eclectic\r\nschools.... The head of St. Paul is apparently copied from Raphael's\r\npicture of St. Cecilia in Bologna. In the types of other figures, in\r\nthe colouring and in the landscape, we perceive the influence of Dosso\r\nDossi and of Garofalo\" (Richter's _Italian Art, etc._ p. 87).\r\n\r\n\r\n624. THE INFANCY OF JUPITER.\r\n\r\n  _Giulio Romano_ (Roman: 1492-1546).\r\n\r\n      Giulio Pippi, called \"the Roman,\" was born at Rome, and was\r\n      Raphael's favourite pupil; to him Raphael bequeathed his\r\n      implements and works of art. But the master could not also\r\n      bequeath his spirit, and in Giulio's works (such as 643 and\r\n      644, which, however, are now attributed to a pupil), though\r\n      \"the archæology is admirable, the movements of the actors are\r\n      affected and forced, and the whole result is a grievous example\r\n      of the mannerism already beginning to prevail\" (Woltmann and\r\n      Woermann: _History of Painting_, ii. 562). \"Raphael worked\r\n      out the mine of his own thought so thoroughly, so completely\r\n      exhausted the motives of his invention, and carried his\r\n      style to such perfection, that he left nothing unused for\r\n      his followers.... In the Roman manner the dramatic element\r\n      was conspicuous; and to carry dramatic painting beyond the\r\n      limits of good style in art is unfortunately easy.... For all\r\n      the higher purposes of genuine art, inspiration passed from\r\n      his pupils as colour fades from Eastern clouds at sunset,\r\n      suddenly\" (Symonds's _Renaissance_, iii. 359).... \"Giulio\r\n      Romano alone, by dint of robust energy and lurid fire of fancy\r\n      flickering amid the smoke of his coarser nature, achieved a\r\n      triumph. His Palazzo del Te at Mantua may be cited as the most\r\n      perfect production of the epoch, combining, as it does, all\r\n      forms of antique decoration and construction with the vivid\r\n      individuality of genius\" (_Symonds_, ii. 319; iii. 360). It was\r\n      in 1523 that Giulio entered the service of Federigo Gonzaga,\r\n      Duke of Mantua, and besides executing a very large number of\r\n      works in oil and fresco, he was distinguished as an architect\r\n      and rebuilt nearly the whole town.[156] Vasari made his\r\n      acquaintance there, and admired his works so much that Giulio\r\n      deserved, he said, to see a statue of himself erected at every\r\n      corner of the city. During his earlier period at Rome, Giulio\r\n      was entrusted with the completion of the frescoes of the Sala\r\n      di Costantino in the Vatican. Among his best oil-pictures are\r\n      the \"Martyrdom of St. Stephen\" in the church of that saint at\r\n      Genoa, and a \"Holy Family\" in the Dresden Gallery.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the classic myth of the infancy of Jupiter, who was\r\nborn in Crete and hidden by his mother, Rhea, in order to save him\r\nfrom his father Saturn (\"all-devouring Time\"), who used to devour his\r\nsons as soon as they were born, from fear of the prophecy that one of\r\nthem would dethrone him. In the background are the Curetes \"who, as\r\nthe story is, erst drowned in Crete that infant cry of Jove, when the\r\nyoung band about the babe in rapid dance, arms in hand to measured\r\ntread, beat brass on brass, that Saturn might not get him to consign to\r\nhis devouring jaws\" (_Lucretius_, Munro's translation, ii. 629). This\r\npicture has been much admired by artists. Samuel Palmer, the friend of\r\nWilliam Blake, wrote of it: \"By the bye, if you want to see a picture\r\nbound by a splendid imagination upon the fine, firm, old philosophy, do\r\ngo and look at the Julio Romano (Nursing of Jupiter) in the National\r\nGallery. That is precisely the picture Blake would have revelled in. I\r\nthink I hear him say, 'As fine as possible, Sir! It is not permitted\r\nto man to do better!'\" (_Memoir of Anne Gilchrist_, p. 59). Elsewhere\r\nPalmer proposed to a friend as a compact test of taste the question:\r\n\"Do I love the Julio Romano in the National Gallery?\" (_Life and\r\nLetters of Samuel Palmer_, p. 250). Another distinguished artist, John\r\nLinnell, was also a great admirer of the picture. He strongly urged\r\nits purchase for the National Gallery, declaring it to be \"full of\r\nbeauty and without any alloy\" (Story's _Life of Linnell_, ii. 123).\r\n\r\n\r\n625. AN ALTAR-PIECE.\r\n\r\n  _Il Moretto_ (Brescian: 1498-1555). _See 299._\r\n\r\nThe principal figure is St. Bernardino of Siena (1380-1444). He was\r\none of the most celebrated preachers of his time: hence the words on\r\nthe open book which he is represented as holding in his left hand,\r\n\"Father, I have manifested thy name to men.\" The Gospel which he\r\npreached was \"Salvation through Jesus Christ\": hence the circle in\r\nhis right hand with the Latin monogram \"I.H.S.\" (Jesus the Saviour of\r\nmankind). He came of a noble family, but the secret of his power was\r\nhis determination to live amongst the poor ones of the earth: hence\r\nat his feet are mitres inscribed with the names of the three cities\r\nof which he refused the bishoprics. The attendant saints are Sts.\r\nJerome, Joseph, Francis (to whose order Bernardino belonged), and\r\nNicholas of Bari. Above is a vision of the only crown to which St.\r\nBernardino aspired--the company of the saints, the Virgin and Child,\r\nSt. Catherine, and St. Clara. Into the pervading expression of simple\r\nand humble piety the artist has put, perhaps, something of his own\r\ncharacter; for he was a man of great personal piety, and he is said to\r\nhave always prepared himself (like Fra Angelico before him) by prayer\r\nand fasting for any important work of sacred art. Something, too, of\r\nthis ascetic ideal may be seen in the attenuated figures of his saints.\r\n\r\n\"In those who already know Moretto, this altar-piece will,\" says Mr.\r\nPater, \"awake many a reminiscence of his art at its best. The three\r\nwhite mitres, for instance, grandly painted towards the centre of\r\nthe picture, at the feet of St. Bernardino, may remind one of the\r\ngreat white mitre which, in the genial picture of St. Nicholas, in\r\nthe _Miracoli_ at Brescia, one of the children, who as delightfully\r\nunconventional acolytes accompany their beloved patron into the\r\npresence of the Madonna, carries along so willingly, laughing almost,\r\nwith pleasure and pride, at his part in so great a function. In the\r\naltar-piece at the National Gallery those white mitres form the keynote\r\nfrom which the pale, cloistral splendours of the whole picture radiate.\r\nYou see what a wealth of enjoyable colour Moretto, for one, can bring\r\nout of monkish habits in themselves sad enough, and receive a new\r\nlesson in the artistic value of reserve\" (\"Art Notes in North Italy,\"\r\nin _New Review_, November 1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n626. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510). _See 1034._\r\n\r\nThis portrait was formerly ascribed in the Official Catalogue to\r\nMasaccio. The wish was perhaps father to the thought, for Masaccio is\r\na very important person in the development of art (being the leader of\r\nthe scientific movement in Florentine painting, and also \"the first\r\nman,\" says Ruskin, \"who entirely broke through the conventionality of\r\nhis time and painted pure landscape\"), and is not otherwise represented\r\nin the National Gallery. Mr. Wornum (the late Keeper) ascribed the\r\nportrait to Filippino Lippi; it is now ascribed to Botticelli, who was\r\nalso distinguished in portrait-painting, which in his time was becoming\r\nincreasingly fashionable. \"The waving lines in the falling hair, and\r\nthe drawing of the mouth, seem to leave no doubt that Botticelli\r\nalone is the author of this impressive, yet simple and unpretentious,\r\nlikeness of an unknown Florentine\" (Richter: _Italian Art in the\r\nNational Gallery_, p. 24).\r\n\r\n\r\n627, 628. WATERFALLS.\r\n\r\n  _Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1628-1682).\r\n\r\n      Jacob van Ruysdael is usually accounted the greatest of the\r\n      Dutch landscape painters. He often painted wild scenery, but\r\n      it is perhaps in the quiet, and as it were uneventful pictures\r\n      from the neighbourhood of Haarlem, that he charms us most. \"At\r\n      each moment in the country around Haarlem,\" says M. Michel,\r\n      \"the name of Ruysdael occurs to one with a recollection of\r\n      some picture of his. One can follow his course and even find\r\n      the very place where he must have sat.\" \"Of all the Dutch\r\n      painters,\" says Fromentin, \"Ruysdael is the one who has the\r\n      noblest resemblance to his country. He has its spaciousness,\r\n      its sadness, its somewhat gloomy placidity, its monotonous\r\n      and tranquil charm.\" But though in this way a product of the\r\n      soil, Ruysdael's genius is essentially human and individual.\r\n      His means of expression were the simplest. His touch is crisp\r\n      and spirited, his workmanship thorough and conscientious; but\r\n      he had no adventitious aids to attraction. There is, however,\r\n      continues Fromentin, something in his works which compels\r\n      respect. \"It is the conviction created by them that they are\r\n      the outcome of a great man who has something to say. The\r\n      cause of his superiority to others is to be found in this,\r\n      that there is behind the painter a man who thinks, behind each\r\n      of his pictures an idea. In studying a picture by Ruysdael we\r\n      become interested also in the personality of the painter. We\r\n      find ourselves asking questions. Had he joys, as he certainly\r\n      had bitterness? Did destiny give him occasion to love other\r\n      things than clouds, and from what did he suffer most, if he\r\n      did suffer, from the torment of painting well or of living?\r\n      All these questions remain without answer, and yet posterity\r\n      is interested in them. Would it occur to you to ask as much\r\n      about Berchem, Karel Dujardin, Wouwerman, Goyen, Terburg,\r\n      Metsu, Peter de Hoogh himself? All these brilliant or charming\r\n      painters painted, and that seems to suffice. Ruysdael painted,\r\n      but he also lived, and that is why it matters so much to know\r\n      how he lived. I know only three or four men in the Dutch school\r\n      whose personality is thus interesting--Rembrandt, Ruysdael,\r\n      Paul Potter, and possibly Cuyp, which is already more than is\r\n      enough to classify them\" (_Les Maitres d'Autrefois_, Hollande,\r\n      ch. vii. See also M. Emile Michel's article in the _Revue des\r\n      deux Mondes_ for 1888). What we find pre-eminently in Ruysdael\r\n      is a mind in harmony with nature in her simplest and most\r\n      sombre moods. \"The grey vapour that overspreads his skies\r\n      seldom admits a fleeting gleam of sunshine to pass through\"\r\n      (Burton). Ruysdael is remarkable also for a certain solemn love\r\n      of solitude, and this love of nature in itself, undisturbed by\r\n      the incidents of daily life, distinguishes him from most of his\r\n      contemporaries, and accounts, perhaps, for his popularity in\r\n      more modern times. Goethe, who admired Ruysdael greatly, calls\r\n      special attention to the painter's success in \"representing the\r\n      Past in the Present,\" and in suggesting to the spectator that\r\n      \"the works of nature live and last longer than the works of\r\n      men\"(\"Ruysdael als Dichter\").\r\n\r\n      The sense of isolation perceptible in his pictures is in\r\n      keeping also with what we know of his life. He was born at\r\n      Haarlem, the son of a picture-dealer and frame-maker, but\r\n      became a citizen of Amsterdam. His father intended him for\r\n      the medical profession, but he probably received instruction\r\n      in painting from his uncle, Salomon van Ruysdael (1439). He\r\n      remained unmarried in order, it is said, to promote the comfort\r\n      of his aged father. He belonged to the sect of the Mennonites,\r\n      who enjoined on their disciples strict separation from the\r\n      world. In Ruysdael's case the world also separated itself\r\n      from him. His talents were ignored by the great public of his\r\n      day; and in 1681 he was admitted into the town's almshouse at\r\n      Haarlem, where he died in the following year. His landscapes\r\n      are now eagerly sought after and command high prices. His\r\n      views are mostly taken from the northern provinces of the\r\n      Netherlands; the Norwegian scenery which he introduced in\r\n      many of his later works being studied probably from sketches\r\n      by Van Everdingen. But it is probable, though (as a writer\r\n      in the _Quarterly Review_ observes) no direct evidence in\r\n      confirmation has yet been found, \"that Ruysdael went to Norway\r\n      either with or without Everdingen, and for a time steeped\r\n      himself in the spirit of the wild landscape. The large number\r\n      of works of the waterfall class that we possess show that he\r\n      was deeply impressed by the artistic and ethical qualities of\r\n      the landscape. Severe, remote, and melancholy, these Norwegian\r\n      solitudes appealed to the mind of this most solitary of\r\n      artists, in whose art, as Goethe said, the poetry of loneliness\r\n      has found an eternal expression.\"\r\n\r\nWaterfalls are a speciality with the painter (the name Ruysdael\r\nappropriately signifies _foaming water_). \"Ordinary running or falling\r\nwater may be sufficiently rendered, by observing careful curves of\r\nprojection with a dark ground, and breaking a little white over it, as\r\nwe see done with judgment and taste by Ruysdael\" (_Modern Painters_,\r\nvol. i. pt. ii. sec. v. ch. i. § 2). \"Ruysdael's painting of falling\r\nwater,\" adds Ruskin (_ibid._ §21), \"is generally agreeable; more than\r\nagreeable it can hardly be considered. There appears no exertion of\r\nmind in any of his works; nor are they calculated to produce either\r\nharm or good by their feeble influence. They are good furniture\r\npictures, unworthy of praise, and undeserving of blame.\" It is\r\ninteresting to compare this damningly faint praise from Ruskin with\r\nthe words of another critic. \"Where is the traveller,\" asks M. Charles\r\nBlanc, \"familiar with the impressive beauties of mountainous countries,\r\nwho cannot find them in the pictures of Ruysdael? At the foot of those\r\nsteep rocks how the water falls, foams, and writhes round the ruins\r\nit has brought down! It dashes forward from the right, from the left,\r\nand from the background of the picture towards the gulf which draws\r\nit in; it rushes down, I was going to say, with a hollow noise, for\r\nin fact one imagines one can almost hear it. We see it gliding down\r\nthe slippery rocks, dashing against the rough bark of the trees, and\r\ngushing down the rugged bottom of the ravine. We fancy we feel the\r\ncold and humid spray falling on our faces.... But such is the power\r\nof genius, that after having seen in all its magnificent reality the\r\nspectacle which the artist has reproduced on a piece of canvas some few\r\ninches in magnitude, nature seems to us less grand and less startling\r\nthan the work of Ruysdael.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n629. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo Costa_ (Ferrarese: 1460-1535).\r\n\r\n      Lorenzo Costa was a pupil of Cosimo Tura, at Ferrara, but was\r\n      soon drawn away to Bologna, where he worked with Francia. The\r\n      friendship of these two men is a good instance of the unity\r\n      between the different arts in the Middle Ages. Thus the\r\n      workshop of Francia at Bologna consisted of two stories. In\r\n      the upper story, pictures were painted under the supervision\r\n      of Costa; whilst in the lower, gold and silver works were\r\n      executed, and coins stamped, under the direction of Francia.\r\n      Costa remained for twenty-three years at Bologna, where many\r\n      of his principal works still exist. The altar-piece in the\r\n      church of S. Giovanni in Monte is the most remarkable. In\r\n      1509, invited by the Marquis Francesco Gonzaga, whose wife\r\n      was Isabella d'Este, Costa fixed his abode in Mantua, where\r\n      he remained till his death. He depicted their court in an\r\n      allegorical composition, now in the Louvre. \"Costa's style,\"\r\n      says Sir F. Burton, \"varied during his long career. His earlier\r\n      works bear signs of his filiation to Tura and Cossa. In later\r\n      productions we may trace more of the amenity of Umbrian art,\r\n      and finally the influence of his own pupil Francia. His best\r\n      merits are a gentle gravity and a sense of colour. Want of\r\n      force mars what is meant for grace.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture (which is signed, and dated 1505) should be compared\r\nwith the Perugino in the next room (288), for Lorenzo Costa has\r\nbeen called \"the Perugino of Ferrara,\" and works of his are in many\r\ngalleries wrongly attributed to Perugino. Every one will feel that\r\nthere is a grace and a sweetness here which recalls Perugino. Lorenzo,\r\ntoo, has Perugino's fondness for a \"purist\" landscape (see 288); and\r\nnote the curious device, peculiar to the Ferrarese School, by which\r\nhe introduces it. The Madonna's throne is constructed in two parts,\r\nso that between the base and the upper part a vacant space is left,\r\nthrough which we look into the open air (\"Thus saith the Lord, the\r\nheaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool\"). One of Costa's\r\nweaknesses may be observed in the figures of the standing saints.\r\n\"His figures are seldom planted firmly on the ground--a fault which\r\nhe shared with Francia. The ill-understood folds of their garments\r\nobscure the form, and trail upon the ground in meaningless tags. This\r\ninsensibility on the part of Costa to one of the noblest means of\r\nexpression in art is remarkable, inasmuch as the works of Francesco\r\nCossa might have set him an example of draperies carefully studied,\r\ntrue to fact, and often grandly disposed\" (Burton).\r\n\r\n\r\n630. MADONNA AND CHILD WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Gregorio Schiavone_ (Paduan: painted about 1470).\r\n\r\nA picture of historical interest, as being the earliest in the\r\nGallery of the Paduan School. Gregorio, the Sclavonian (_i.e._\r\nDalmatian), though not, one must think, a very good artist, was proud\r\nof his master, and this picture is signed (on the little card below\r\nthe throne) \"the work of Schiavone, the pupil of Squarcione.\" That\r\nmaster's style was distinguished by its _sculpturesque_ quality; and\r\nin the works of a somewhat clumsy pupil like Gregorio (\"this Dalmatian\r\nclodhopper,\" Morelli calls him) one sees this tendency carried to\r\nexcess; the outline of the Madonna's face here, and still more in\r\n904, is quite grotesquely sharp. Another characteristic of the school\r\nis exemplified in both Gregorio's pictures--the choice, namely, of\r\nantique embellishments, of bas-reliefs, and festoons of fruit, in the\r\naccessories. Thus note here the bas-relief behind the Madonna's chair,\r\nand in 904 the festoons of fruit upon the arch.\r\n\r\n\r\n631. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Francesco Bissolo_ (Venetian: painted 1500-1528).\r\n\r\nBy one of Bellini's pupils and imitators. Observe the rich dress of a\r\nByzantine stuff embroidered with strange animals, such as one sees in\r\nthe old mosaics at Venice. The lady wears too a long gold chain, as the\r\nVenetian women do to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n632, 633. TWO SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Girolamo da Santa Croce_ (Venetian: painted 1520-1550).\r\n\r\n      Girolamo--a relation probably of Francesco Rizo, also of Santa\r\n      Croce (a village near Bergamo)--was one of the weaker followers\r\n      of Giovanni Bellini. Morelli mentions, as a sign by which\r\n      Girolamo's pictures, which are frequently met with in North\r\n      Italian galleries, may often be recognised, that \"he introduced\r\n      a parrot whenever the subject he was treating would allow it,\r\n      just as Paolo Farinato used to put a snail into his paintings\r\n      as a sort of mark.\"\r\n\r\nThese two panels were formerly the doors of an altar-piece.\r\n\r\n\r\n634. THE MADONNA OF THE GOLDFINCH.\r\n\r\n  _Cima da Conegliano_ (Venetian: 1460-1518). _See 300._\r\n\r\nThe Madonna here wears a graver expression than is common with Cima.\r\nThere is the usual hilly background, with the ruins of a Roman temple\r\nintroduced on the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n635. THE \"REPOSE.\"\r\n\r\n  _Titian_ (Venetian: 1477-1576). _See 4._\r\n\r\nThe subject of this radiantly beautiful picture is the familiar\r\n\"Repose\" of the Holy Family during their flight into Egypt;\r\n\"perfect serenity and repose\" are the keynote of the composition.\r\nThe introduction of St. John the Baptist, and St. Catherine[157]\r\nembracing the Holy Child, and in the distance the angel appearing to\r\nthe shepherds, serve as the sign-manuals to mark the sacred subject.\r\nFor the rest it is a simple domestic scene, laid amongst the hills of\r\nTitian's country, near Ceneda, on the way to Cadore:--\r\n\r\n      To this Ceneda scenery I would assign those charming mixtures\r\n      of woodland and plain,--those sweeping intermingling lines of\r\n      hill, here broken by a jutting rock, sinking there into the\r\n      sudden depth of bosky shades,--which are another characteristic\r\n      of Titian's landscape. The play of light and shade over such\r\n      a country, throwing out now this, now that, of the billowy\r\n      ranges as they alternately smiled in sunshine, or frowned in\r\n      shadow; now printing off a tower or a crag, dark against a\r\n      far-off flitting gleam, now touching into brightness a cottage\r\n      or a castle; he specially delighted to record.... It must\r\n      have been from the village of Caverzano, and within an easy\r\n      walk from Belluno, that he took the mountain forms, and noted\r\n      the sublime effect upon them of evening light, introduced\r\n      in the \"Madonna and St. Catherine.\" The lines of hill and\r\n      mountain are identical with a record in my sketch-book, and the\r\n      sharp-pointed hill, almost lost in the rays, is one of the most\r\n      familiar features in the neighbourhood of Belluno (Gilbert:\r\n      _Cadore_, pp. 36, 59).\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert makes another interesting remark, which may be verified in\r\nthis picture with its flocks of sheep, as well as in 270, with its farm\r\nbuildings:\r\n\r\n      Another characteristic of Titian's landscape, and new in his\r\n      time, is his perception of its domestic charm--the sweetness\r\n      of a home landscape. A cottage, a farm, a mill, take the\r\n      place with him of the temples, towers, and lordly palaces of\r\n      town-bred painters.... Honest travellers on a country track,\r\n      or sleeping in the shade; the peasant going forth to labour,\r\n      or returning with his tools; the high-roofed, quaintly gabled\r\n      farm, with its nondescript surroundings, and all set snugly on\r\n      the bosky knoll ... these are his favourite subjects. But they\r\n      never would have been so to a thorough Venetian. They show us\r\n      the man of the hills--the breezy, happy hills: the man of many\r\n      pleasant memories, upon the sward, beside the brook, under the\r\n      bending boughs: the man who carried no city apprehensions, or\r\n      city squeamishness to country places, but was at home anywhere\r\n      under the broad heaven (_ibid._ p. 60).\r\n\r\nThe colour-scheme of this masterpiece is worth noting. It is in keeping\r\nwith the effect of coolness and repose aimed at in the composition.\r\n\"The dominant chord is composed by the cerulean blues of the heaven and\r\nof the Virgin's dress, the deep luscious greens of the landscape and\r\nthe peculiar pale citron hue, relieved with a crimson girdle, of the\r\nrobe worn by St. Catherine. With this exception there is not a trace\r\nof red in the picture. Contrary to almost universal usage, it might\r\nalmost be said to orthodoxy, the entire draperies of the Virgin are of\r\none intense blue. Her veil-like headgear is of a brownish-gray, while\r\nthe St. Catherine wears a golden-brown scarf, continuing the glories of\r\nher elaborately dressed hair. The audacity of the colour-scheme is only\r\nequalled by its success; no calculated effort at anything unusual being\r\napparent\" (Claude Phillips: _The Later Work of Titian_, p. 10).\r\n\r\nThis picture, which is signed TICIAN, was formerly in the Sacristy of\r\nthe Escurial; it has the Escurial mark on the back. A \"Madonna with\r\nSt. Catherine\" by Titian is mentioned in a letter of 1530 written by\r\nGiacomo Malatesta to Federigo Gonzaga at Mantua. The reference is\r\nsupposed by Crowe and Cavalcaselle to be to the \"Vierge au Lupin\" of\r\nthe Louvre; but it may be to our picture (see Phillips: _The Earlier\r\nWork of Titian_, p. 82 _n._).\r\n\r\n\r\n636. \"PORTRAIT OF A POET.\"\r\n\r\n  _Titian_; or _Palma Vecchio_ (Bergamese: 1480-1528).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\nThis picture was long ascribed to Titian; then for many years to Palma\r\n(of whom, therefore, some notice is here retained); now it has been\r\nrestored by the officials to Titian. Others believe it to be the work\r\nof Giorgione (see below).\r\n\r\n      Jacopo Palma, the elder (II Vecchio), is one of the most\r\n      illustrious of the \"post-Bellinian School\" of painters at\r\n      Venice. But he was born near Bergamo and \"could never\r\n      entirely lay aside his mountain nature in his works\" (see\r\n      Morelli's _German Galleries_, pp. 13-18, 24-31, for the best\r\n      account of Palma's place in art history). He was especially\r\n      great in the Holy Families, called by the Italians \"Sante\r\n      Conversazioni,\" in which the figures of sacred story are\r\n      grouped together in restful attitudes and enframed with blue\r\n      mountain landscapes. He painted so many of these compositions\r\n      that Ruskin says--somewhat too sweepingly--that he painted \"no\r\n      profane subject of importance\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v.\r\n      pt. ix. ch. iii. § 17). He was also a magnificent painter of\r\n      female and fancy portraits--a branch of art in which he rivals\r\n      even Titian. Palma's works are sometimes divided into three\r\n      manners--the Bellinesque, the Giorgionesque, and the _blonde_.\r\n      Among the most famous of his productions are the \"Adoration\r\n      of the Shepherds,\" in the Louvre; the \"Jacob and Rachel,\" at\r\n      Dresden; and the altar-piece in St. Sebastiano at Vicenza--\"his\r\n      finest and most perfect work,\" according to Morelli. His \"St.\r\n      Barbara,\" in S. Maria Formosa at Venice, is also celebrated.\r\n      The so-called \"Bella da Tiziano,\" at Rome, and the \"Three\r\n      Sisters,\" at Dresden, are among the best-known of his portraits.\r\n\r\nThis fine portrait was formerly supposed to represent Ariosto\r\n(1474-1533), who was acquainted with Titian and commemorates him as one\r\n\"who honours Cadore not less than Sebastiano del Piombo and Raphael\r\nhonour Venice and Urbino.\" But the portrait bears little resemblance to\r\nthe poet as he is known to us by authenticated likenesses. The title\r\n\"Portrait of a Poet\" is based partly on the character of the face,\r\npartly on the bush of laurel in the background. The evidence for the\r\nascription to Palma is by no means conclusive (see _Notes and Queries_,\r\nDec. 28, 1889). Mr. W. Fred Dickes has suggested--ingeniously, if not\r\nconvincingly--that the portrait is of the famous \"Liberator of Italy,\"\r\nProspero Colonna (1464-1523), painted in 1500, when he was living in\r\ntemporary retirement as a lay brother in a Benedictine monastery.\r\nProspero is described as \"tall in person, ruddy in countenance; his\r\neyes were black, his beard reddish, and the locks of his hair of a\r\nchestnut character.\" The laurel would be appropriate to a victorious\r\ncaptain, no less than to a poet. Mr. Dickes ascribes the portrait\r\nto Giorgione (see _Magazine of Art_, March and April 1893). This\r\nascription is accepted by Mr. Herbert Cook. \"The conception is\r\ncharacteristic of Giorgione--the pensive charm, the feeling of reserve,\r\nthe touch of fanciful imagination in the decorative accessories, but,\r\nabove all, the extreme refinement.... Where can the like be found\r\nin Palma, or even Titian? Titian is more virile in his conception,\r\nless lyrical, less fanciful; Palma, infinitely less subtle in\r\ncharacterisation\" (_Giorgione_, p. 84).\r\n\r\n\r\n637. DAPHNIS AND CHLOE.\r\n\r\n  _Paris Bordone_ (Venetian: 1500-1570).\r\n\r\n      Paris Bordone, one of the most splendid colourists of the\r\n      Venetian School, was born of a noble family of Treviso. \"He was\r\n      taken,\" says Vasari, \"at the age of eight to certain of his\r\n      mother's kindred in Venice, where, having studied grammar and\r\n      become an excellent musician, he was sent to Titian.\" With him\r\n      he remained for a few years, and afterwards \"set himself to\r\n      imitate the manner of Giorgione to the utmost of his power.\"\r\n      \"Though Venetian in his education, he took a path peculiar\r\n      to himself, and it is only a very inexperienced eye that can\r\n      mistake him for Giorgione or Titian. He is remarkable for a\r\n      delicate rosy colour in his flesh, and for the purple, crimson,\r\n      and shot tints of his draperies, which are usually in small\r\n      and crumpled folds\" (Kugler). His most famous work--the large\r\n      picture in the Venetian Academy of \"The Fisherman presenting\r\n      the Ring of St. Mark to the Doge\"--is a masterpiece of gorgeous\r\n      colouring. \"The moment you come before the picture you say,\r\n      '_What_ a piece of colour!' To Paris the Duke, the Senate, and\r\n      the miracle are all merely vehicles for flashes of scarlet\r\n      and gold on marble and silk\" (Ruskin's _Guide to the Venetian\r\n      Academy_, p. 17). He painted sacred subjects, mythology,\r\n      and portraits. In all alike he found occasion for the same\r\n      brilliant display of flesh-tints and stuffs. Visitors to the\r\n      Italian lakes will find a Holy Family by Bordone at Lovere, in\r\n      the Accademia Tadini, which is another of his masterpieces.\r\n      There are some fine portraits by him at Hampton Court, and No.\r\n      674 in our Gallery is a very characteristic example. Chloe in\r\n      the picture before us belongs to the same type. \"The ideal\r\n      of beauty for women in Italy during the sixteenth century\r\n      was--perhaps because so difficult of attainment!--extreme\r\n      blondness. Palma seems to have had no other aim than to fill\r\n      his canvases with expanses of fair flesh and yellow hair. Paris\r\n      Bordone succeeded Palma as the fashionable beauty-painter, and\r\n      continued the tradition\" (Mary Logan: _Guide to the Italian\r\n      Pictures at Hampton Court_, p. 28). The fame of Bordone led\r\n      to his being invited to France by Francis II. in 1558-1559 to\r\n      paint the ladies of the Court. He was knighted by the king. He\r\n      also visited Augsburg to execute commissions for the merchant\r\n      princes of that city. \"He lives quietly in his own house,\" says\r\n      Vasari, \"working only at the request of princes, or others of\r\n      his friends, avoiding all rivalry and those vain ambitions\r\n      which do but disturb the repose of man.\"\r\n\r\nDaphnis and Chloe, a shepherd and shepherdess, whose life and love were\r\na favourite Greek story, are about to be crowned by Cupid with a wreath\r\nof myrtle.\r\n\r\n\r\n638. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Francia_ (Ferrarese-Bolognese: 1450-1517).\r\n\r\nFor more important pictures by this master, see 179 and 180. The saint\r\nwith the palm-branch here will be recognised in one of the angels in\r\n180.\r\n\r\n\r\n639. \"NOLI ME TANGERE!\"\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Mantegna_ (Paduan: about 1470-1517).\r\n\r\n      Francesco was the pupil and assistant of his father Andrea,\r\n      whose style is very obvious in this and the two companion\r\n      pictures (1106, 1381). Francesco completed some work which\r\n      Andrea had left unfinished.\r\n\r\n(For the subject see 270.) The three little pictures by Francesco (639,\r\n1106, 1381) are all noticeable for their dainty detail, often selected\r\nfor symbolic meaning. Thus, notice here the vine with purple grapes\r\nsupported on a dead tree which hangs over the figure of Christ--an\r\nemblem of life and death. The vine is the most ancient of all symbols\r\nof Christ and his Church, being founded on His own words: \"I am the\r\nvine, ye are the branches.\" On the other side a bird is seen defending\r\nits nest against a snake which has crept up the tree; on the left is a\r\nbeehive.\r\n\r\n\r\n640. ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Dosso Dossi_ (Ferrarese: 1479-1542).\r\n\r\n      Giovanni di Lutero, who adopted the name of Dosso Dossi,\r\n      was the greatest colourist of the Ferrarese School. \"His\r\n      masterpiece is the great altar picture formerly in the Church\r\n      of S. Andrea at Ferrara, but now in the public gallery of that\r\n      city, and one of the principal art treasures of Italy. This\r\n      sumptuous work, notwithstanding the irreparable injuries it\r\n      had sustained from injudicious restorations and repaints, is\r\n      still a perfect blaze of colour\" (Kugler). The little picture\r\n      before us gives an inadequate impression of the painter's\r\n      powers. No. 1234 is more characteristic. For Dossi's real bent\r\n      lay towards portraiture and romantic subjects. Portraits by\r\n      him of the Dukes of Ferrara and of other personages are in the\r\n      public gallery at Modena. Of his subject-pictures the \"Circe\"\r\n      of the Borghese Gallery at Rome is the most sumptuous. The\r\n      records of Dossi's career are scanty; but his works \"point\r\n      strongly to two widely different currents of influence, the\r\n      one Venetian, the other Ferrarese.\" He is supposed to have\r\n      been for some years at Venice, but to have studied first under\r\n      the Ferrarese Lorenzo Costa at Bologna. \"His education in art,\r\n      the main characteristics of his style, and his long residence\r\n      at Ferrara, where he was attached to the court, and where\r\n      he chiefly worked, entitle him to a place in the Ferrarese\r\n      School.... His colouring is much admired, and justly, for its\r\n      force, brilliancy, and novel harmonies: but it would be a\r\n      mistake to class it with that of the great Venetian masters\r\n      who had a profounder knowledge and a purer ideal of colour\"\r\n      (Burton). Dossi's romantic genius was no doubt fostered by\r\n      his friendship with Ariosto, who celebrated Dosso and his\r\n      brother Battista in somewhat exaggerated terms, naming them\r\n      in the same breath with Leonardo, Mantegna, Bellini, Michael\r\n      Angelo, Raphael, and Titian. \"The name of Dosso,\" says Vasari\r\n      ill-naturedly, \"had then obtained greater fame from the pen of\r\n      Messer Ludovico than from all the pencils and colours consumed\r\n      by himself in the whole course of his life.\" Dosso was highly\r\n      favoured, he adds, by Duke Alphonso, of Ferrara, \"first because\r\n      of his abilities in art, and next on account of his excellent\r\n      qualities as a man and the pleasantness of his manners, which\r\n      were advantages always highly acceptable to the Duke\" (iii.\r\n      256). There are many pictures by Dosso in private collections\r\n      in England. The exhibition of the Ferrarese School at the\r\n      Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1894 included thirteen of them.\r\n      He is well represented at Hampton Court. \"His works,\" says\r\n      Mary Logan in an interesting appreciation of the painter, \"are\r\n      distinguished from all Venetian paintings by effects of light\r\n      in dreamland rather than in the everyday world (and have in\r\n      them) ... a fascinating touch of the bizarre\" (Kyrle Society's\r\n      _Guide to the Italian Pictures at Hampton Court_). Many\r\n      pictures passing under other names have been restored to Dosso\r\n      by Morelli (see his _Borghese and Doria-Pamfili Galleries_, pp.\r\n      214-219).\r\n\r\n\r\n641. THE WOMAN TAKEN IN ADULTERY.\r\n\r\n  _Ludovico Mazzolino_ (Ferrarese: 1480-1528). _See 169._\r\n\r\nA picture chiefly remarkable, like 169, for its accessories. Notice the\r\nornamental sculpture, the paintings in imitation of bronze relievo, and\r\nthe modelled plaster work on the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n642. CHRIST'S AGONY IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  _Garofalo_ (Ferrarese: 1481-1559). _See 81._\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare this with other versions of the subject\r\nin the Gallery--_e.g._ 76, 726, 1417. What we may call the necessary\r\ncomponent parts of the picture are all present--the angel with cup\r\nand cross, the sleeping apostles, a crowd with torches approaching.\r\nBut Garofalo's picture seems cold and unimaginative as compared with\r\nCorreggio's, Bellini's, or Mantegna's.\r\n\r\n\r\n643. THE CAPTURE OF CARTHAGENA.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Rinaldo Mantovano_ (Roman: early 16th century).\r\n\r\n      This and the companion picture, 644, formerly ascribed to\r\n      Giulio Romano, are now ascribed to Rinaldo of Mantua, one of\r\n      the scholars whom Giulio formed when at work in that city.\r\n      Rinaldo is mentioned by Vasari as the ablest painter that\r\n      Mantua ever produced, and as having been \"prematurely removed\r\n      from the world by death.\"\r\n\r\nIn the upper compartment is represented the capture of New Carthage by\r\nthe Roman general, Publius Cornelius Scipio, B.C. 210. He distinguished\r\nhimself on that occasion by the generosity with which he treated the\r\nSpanish hostages kept there by the Carthaginians. This is the subject\r\nof the lower compartment. Among the hostages was a girl--hardly\r\nrepresented here as in the story, \"so beautiful that all eyes turned\r\nupon her\"--whom Scipio protected from indignity and formally betrothed\r\nto her own lover, who is here advancing to touch the great man's hand,\r\nand when they brought thank-offerings to Scipio, he ordered them, as we\r\nsee here, to be removed again: \"accept them from me,\" he said, \"as the\r\ngirl's dowry\" (_Livy_, xxvi. ch. 50).\r\n\r\n\r\n644. THE RAPE OF THE SABINES.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Rinaldo Mantovano_ (Roman: early 16th century).\r\n\r\nRomulus, the founder of Rome--so the story goes--had collected a\r\nmotley crew of men about him, and demanded women from the neighbouring\r\nstates wherewith to people his kingdom. And when they refused, he\r\ndetermined to take them by stratagem. He appointed a day for a splendid\r\nsacrifice, with public games and shows, and the neighbouring Sabines\r\nflocked with their wives and daughters to see the sight. He himself\r\npresided, sitting among his nobles, clothed in purple. As a signal for\r\nthe assault, he was to rise, gather up his robe, and fold it about\r\nhim. Many of the people wore swords that day, and kept their eyes upon\r\nhim, watching for the signal, which was no sooner given than they\r\ndrew them, and, rushing on with a shout, seized the daughters of the\r\nSabines, but quietly suffered the men to escape. This is the subject\r\nof the upper compartment of this picture. But afterwards the Sabines\r\nfought the Romans in order to recover their daughters. The battle was\r\nlong and fierce, until the Sabine women threw themselves between the\r\ncombatants and induced them to ratify the accomplished union with\r\nterms of friendship and alliance. This is the subject of the lower\r\ncompartment--the intervention of the Sabine women in the right-hand\r\npart, the reconciliation in the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n645. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Albertinelli_ (Florentine: 1474-1515).\r\n\r\n      Mariotto Albertinelli, a pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, was the\r\n      friend and assistant of the painter-monk, Fra Bartolommeo (see\r\n      1694). He himself, being of an impatient character, \"was so\r\n      offended with certain criticisms of his work,\" says Vasari,\r\n      \"that he gave up painting and turned publican.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture is often now attributed to a later painter--Sogliani,\r\n1492-1544.\r\n\r\n\r\n646. ST. CATHARINE.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Umbrian School: 15th century).\r\n\r\nThis, and the companion picture (647), formerly deposited in the South\r\nKensington Museum, were at the time of their purchase (in 1860) from\r\nthe Beauconsin Collection \"ascribed to Ridolfo Ghirlandajo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n647. ST. URSULA.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Umbrian School: 15th century).\r\n\r\nThe emblem of her martyrdom, an arrow, is in her right hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n648. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo di Credi_ (Florentine: 1459-1537). _See 593._\r\n\r\nA pretty landscape background, with a ruin, and the angel appearing\r\nto the shepherds in the distance--the whole charmingly harmonious in\r\nits blue-grays. \"A pure and simple-minded man, Lorenzo delighted in\r\npure, bright, and simple landscapes, in which one reads something of\r\nthe gentle Angelico's feeling. Nature with Credi, as with the saint\r\nof Fiesole, must show no stain, no trouble, no severity, no sign of\r\nthe transient. Far be it from him to introduce the jagged ranges that\r\nLeonardo reared upon his far, mysterious horizons. No, he must have all\r\nthat is green and blue, and cheerful\" (Gilbert's _Landscape in Art_, p.\r\n225). With regard to the landscape backgrounds of the Italian painters,\r\nMr. Mackail, in a letter to F. T. Palgrave (_Journals and Memories_,\r\np. 256), raises the question \"whether landscape painting has not lost\r\nas well as gained by being elevated from the background into the\r\nsubstance of a picture; whether, that is, the moral or human interest\r\nthat is essential to all great art can exist in pure landscape painting\r\nwithout putting a greater strain on it than it will bear. Take, for\r\ninstance, the landscape backgrounds of Lorenzo di Credi's pictures in\r\nthe National Gallery, or of the great Perugino triptych. Have they\r\nnot a moral or spiritual quality, as they stand in their place in the\r\npicture, that they can only have through this elusive (if one may say\r\nso) treatment?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n649. PORTRAIT OF A BOY.\r\n\r\n  _Angelo Bronzino_ (Florentine: 1502-1572).\r\n\r\n      Angelo di Cosimo, called Il Bronzino, was born in a suburb\r\n      of Florence, of poor parents; he became a popular artist,\r\n      \"nor have we any one in our day,\" says Vasari, \"who is more\r\n      ingenious, varied, fanciful, and spirited in the jesting kind\r\n      of verse.\" He was also good at a more serious kind of verse;\r\n      amongst other things he wrote sonnets on Benvenuto Cellini's\r\n      \"Perseus,\" of which Cellini says, \"they spoke so generously\r\n      of my performance, in that fine style of his which is most\r\n      exquisite, that this alone repaid me somewhat for the pain\r\n      of my long troubles.\" Vasari was a great friend of his, and\r\n      speaks in the warmest terms of his generosity and kindness. He\r\n      was the favourite pupil of Pontormo, some of whose works, left\r\n      unfinished, he completed. His portraits, if sometimes hard and\r\n      cold, are often excellent, and form a gallery of great interest\r\n      to the historian of Florence. In his frescoes and allegories,\r\n      he belongs to the period of decline. His \"Descent of Christ\r\n      into Hell,\" in the Uffizi, is among the most celebrated of\r\n      his works. \"Want of thought and feeling, combined with the\r\n      presumptuous treatment of colossal and imaginative subjects,\r\n      renders his compositions inexpressibly chilling\" (_Symonds_,\r\n      iii. 365). Ruskin cites him as an instance of the \"base\r\n      grotesque of men who, having no true imagination, are apt,\r\n      more than others, to try by startling realism to enforce the\r\n      monstrosity that has no terror in itself\" (_Modern Painters_,\r\n      vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. viii. § 8).\r\n\r\nThis charming portrait was formerly attributed to Pontormo. Sir Edward\r\nPoynter, following Frizzoni, has transferred it to Bronzino. (See _Arte\r\nItaliana del Rinascimento_, p. 267.)\r\n\r\n\r\n650. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Angelo Bronzino_ (Florentine: 1502-1572). _See 649._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n\"In the rich costume of the sixteenth century,\" says the Official\r\nCatalogue,--and the picture therein resembles most portraits of the\r\ntime. For it is a remarkable thing how much great art depends on\r\ngay and dainty gowns. Note first, in going round these rooms, how\r\nfondly all the best painters enjoy dress patterns. \"It doesn't matter\r\nwhat school they belong to--Fra Angelico, Perugino, John Bellini,\r\nGiorgione, Titian, Tintoret, Veronese, Leonardo da Vinci--no matter\r\nhow they differ in other respects, all of them like dress patterns;\r\nand what is more, the nobler the painter is, the surer he is to do\r\nhis patterns well.\" Then note, as following from this fact, how much\r\nof the splendour of the pictures that we most admire depends on\r\nsplendour of dress. \"True nobleness of dress is a necessity to any\r\nnation which wishes to possess living art, concerned with portraiture\r\nof human nature. No good historical painting ever yet existed, or\r\never can exist, where the dresses of the people of the time are not\r\nbeautiful; and had it not been for the lovely and fantastic dressing\r\nof the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, neither French nor\r\nFlorentine nor Venetian art could have risen to anything like the rank\r\nit reached\" (see, _e.g._, under 294). And with regard to this nobleness\r\nof dress, it may be observed lastly how \"the best dressing was never\r\nthe costliest; and its effect depended much more on its beautiful and,\r\nin early times, modest arrangement, and on the simple and lovely manner\r\nof its colour, than on gorgeousness of clasp or embroidery\" (_Cambridge\r\nInaugural Address_, p. 11; _A joy for ever_, § 54).\r\n\r\n\r\n651. AN ALLEGORY: \"ALL IS VANITY.\"\r\n\r\n  _Angelo Bronzino_ (Florentine: 1502-1572). _See 649._\r\n\r\nVenus, crowned as Queen of Life, yet with the apple of discord in\r\nher hand, turns her head to kiss Cupid, whose wings are coloured in\r\nDelight, but behind whom is the gaunt figure of Jealousy, tearing her\r\nhair. Folly, with one foot in manacles, and the other treading on a\r\nthorn, is preparing to throw a handful of roses--\r\n\r\n    Sweet is Love and sweet is the Rose,\r\n      Each has a flower and each has a thorn.\r\n\r\nA Harpy, the personification of vain desire and fitful passion, with a\r\nhuman face, but with claws to her feet and with a serpent's body, is\r\noffering in one hand a piece of honey-comb, whilst she holds her sting\r\nbehind her in the other. In one corner, beneath the God of Love, doves\r\nare billing and cooing; but over against them, beneath Folly, there are\r\nmasks showing the hideous emptiness of human passion. And behind them\r\nall is Time, with wings to speed his course and the hour-glass on his\r\nshoulders to mark his seasons, preparing to let down the veil which\r\nPleasure, with grapes twined in her hair, and with the scowl of angry\r\ndisappointment on her face, seeks in vain to lift--\r\n\r\n    \"Redeem mine hours--the space is brief--\r\n      While in my glass the sand-grains shiver,\r\n    And measureless thy joy or grief,\r\n      When Time and thou shalt part for ever!\"\r\n\r\nSCOTT: _The Antiquary_.\r\n\r\nThis picture--in some ways harsh and vulgar--was originally painted for\r\nFrancis I. of France. For a note on its crude colouring, see 270.\r\n\r\n\r\n652. CHARITY.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Salviati_ (Florentine: 1510-1563).\r\n\r\n      Francesco Rossi, called \"de' Salviati\" from his patron, the\r\n      Cardinal of that name, studied under Andrea del Sarto, and was\r\n      an imitator of Michael Angelo. He was a great friend of Vasari,\r\n      whose life of Salviati gives a most interesting account of\r\n      their intimacy, especially of their early student days, when\r\n      they \"met together and went on festival days or at other times\r\n      to copy a design from the best works wherever these were to be\r\n      found dispersed about the city of Florence.\" In 1548 Salviati\r\n      settled in Rome, where he was much employed.\r\n\r\nThe usual pictorial representation of Charity, as a woman surrounded\r\nby children and giving suck, is the same as Spenser's description of\r\n\"Charissa\"--\r\n\r\n      She was a woman in her freshest age,\r\n    Of wondrous beauty, and of bounty rare....\r\n    Her necke and brests were ever open bare,\r\n    That aye thereof her babes might sucke their fill....\r\n      A multitude of babes about her hong,\r\n    Playing their sportes, that joy'd her to behold;\r\n    Whom still she fed whiles they were weake and young,\r\n    But thrust them forth still as they wexed old.\r\n\r\n  _The Faërie Queene_, i. 10. xxx. xxxi.\r\n\r\n\r\n653. HUSBAND AND WIFE.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n\r\nThis picture, formerly ascribed to Roger van der Weyden, and called\r\n\"The Painter and his Wife,\" is delightfully typical of the Flemish\r\nideal both in man and woman--\"the man shrewd and determined, the woman\r\nsweet and motherly.\" \"They are not fine of figure nor graceful of\r\nlimb, but, with hardly an exception, their faces tell us that they\r\nare men of tried capacity and learnt experience. Through the eyes of\r\nmany of them glances a happy, childlike soul enough, but the mind is\r\nalmost invariably a slow-moving, solid power ... and such as they, were\r\nthe artists who painted them; they possessed the same industry, they\r\nadmired the same qualities. The virtue of honest strength, which made\r\nthe men of Flanders the merchant princes of Europe, was the virtue\r\nwhose traces the artists of Flanders loved to observe.... They care\r\nlittle for mystery, little for pity, little for enthusiasm.... They\r\nlove a man whose visage tells the strength of his character, who has\r\nweathered the buffetings of many a storm, and bears on his visage the\r\nmarks of the struggle\" (Conway's _Early Flemish Artists_, p. 104).\r\n\r\n\r\n654. THE MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Later School of Roger van der Weyden_ (Early Flemish:\r\n  1400-about 1464). _See_ 664.\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\nKnown for the Magdalen by the small vase at her feet--emblem, in all\r\nthe religious painters, of the alabaster box of ointment--\"the symbol\r\nat once of her conversion and her love.\" In these \"reading Magdalens\"\r\nshe is represented as now reconciled to heaven, and magnificently\r\nattired--in reference to her former state of worldly prosperity.\r\n\"It is difficult for us, in these days, to conceive the passionate\r\nadmiration and devotion with which the Magdalen was regarded by her\r\nvotaries in the Middle Ages. The imputed sinfulness of her life only\r\nbrought her nearer to them. Those who did not dare to lift up their\r\neyes to the more saintly models of purity and holiness,--the martyrs\r\nwho had suffered in the cause of chastity,--took courage to invoke\r\nher intercession\" (Mrs. Jameson: _Sacred and Legendary Art_, p. 205).\r\nHence the numerous Magdalens to be met with in nearly every picture\r\ngallery; in art decidedly there has been \"more joy over one sinner that\r\nrepenteth than over ninety-and-nine that need no repentance.\"\r\n\r\n\"This picture is undoubtedly by the unknown master who painted two\r\nremarkable panels formerly in the Abbey of Flémalle in Belgium, but now\r\nin the Städel Museum at Frankfort-on-Maine. They present respectively\r\nthe standing figure of the Virgin with the Infant at her breast, and\r\nthe figure of St. Veronica, as an elderly woman, holding before her\r\nthe sacred napkin on which is the impression of our Lord's visage.\r\nThese, and a third panel in the same museum, representing the Trinity,\r\nbut, unlike the others, painted in monochrome, must have belonged to a\r\nlarge altar-piece in many compartments, of which it is quite possible\r\nthe small picture above described may have formed one\" (_Official\r\nCatalogue_). Mr. Claude Phillips, on the other hand, while admiring\r\nthe delicate and exquisite colour of our picture and the enamel-like\r\nquality of its surface, sees in it no resemblance to the works\r\ndescribed above (see _Academy_, Sept. 28, 1889).\r\n\r\n\r\n655. THE READING MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Bernard van Orley_ (Flemish: about 1490-1542).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      This painter, who studied in Raphael's school, was a designer\r\n      for tapestry (the staple industry of Brussels in his time) and\r\n      stained glass, as well as what is now exclusively called an\r\n      artist, and had all a designer's care for little things. He\r\n      superintended the manufacture of the tapestries of the Vatican\r\n      made from Raphael's cartoons, and there are some tapestries by\r\n      him in the great hall at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\nNotice the prettily designed cup in ivory and gold--symbolical of the\r\nbox of precious ointment offered by the Magdalen to her Lord. For the\r\nsubject see under last picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n656: A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n_Mabuse_ (Flemish: about 1470-1541).\r\n\r\n      Jan Gossart, called Mabuse from the town in Hainault (now in\r\n      France) where he was born, is interesting in the history of\r\n      art as the man who began the emigration of Flemish painters to\r\n      Italy. He set out in 1508 in the suite of Philip of Burgundy,\r\n      and remained about ten years in Italy where he copied the works\r\n      of Leonardo and Michael Angelo. He was one of the illuminators\r\n      of the famous Grimani Breviary in the Library at Venice. The\r\n      finest example of the first, or Flemish period of Mabuse is\r\n      the \"Adoration of the Magi\" at Castle Howard. To his second\r\n      period, in which Italian influence is discernible, belongs\r\n      the altar-piece in the Cathedral of Prague. There is a good\r\n      portrait group by him at Hampton Court representing the\r\n      children of King Christian II. of Denmark. A very fine work,\r\n      attributed to Mabuse, has recently been added to the Gallery,\r\n      No. 1689.\r\n\r\nThe sitter here is of the Flemish national type, but the Italian\r\ninfluence may be seen in the Renaissance architecture of the background.\r\n\r\n\r\n657. A DUTCH GENTLEMAN AND LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Jacob Cornelissen_ (Dutch: about 1475-1555).\r\n\r\n      This painter was the master of Jan Schorel (720), and is\r\n      mentioned by Van Mander as a great artist. Most of his\r\n      altar-pieces for the churches of Holland perished during the\r\n      Reformation. He was also an engraver, and his woodcuts were as\r\n      much admired as the copperplates of his contemporary, Lucas\r\n      van Leyden. He had a son, Dirk, who was also a good painter,\r\n      especially of portraits.\r\n\r\nPresumably a husband and wife--the donors, we may suppose, of an\r\naltar-piece. Their patron saints attend them. St. Peter lays his hand\r\napprovingly on the man's shoulder. The woman, as \"the weaker vessel,\"\r\nseems to be supported by St. Paul. It should be noticed that in sacred\r\nand legendary art these two saints are almost always introduced\r\ntogether--St. Peter, with the keys, representing the church of the\r\nconverted Jews, St. Paul that of the Gentiles: his common attributes\r\nare a book (denoting his Epistles), and a sword, signifying the manner\r\nof his martyrdom, and being emblematic also of \"the good fight\" fought\r\nby the faithful Christian with \"the sword of the Spirit, which is the\r\nword of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n658. THE DEATH OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _After Schongauer_. (German-Swabian: 1450-about 1488).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      A picture, painted perhaps by Hugo van der Goes, on the\r\n      lines of a print by Martin Schongauer, who was known to his\r\n      contemporaries as \"the glory of painters\" and \"Martin the\r\n      Beautiful.\" He was born at Colmar, but probably studied under\r\n      Roger van der Weyden. By some the picture is ascribed to the\r\n      anonymous \"Master of Flémalle,\" a contemporary of Roger van der\r\n      Weyden: for whom see a little picture in Room XVI., now (1908)\r\n      lent to the Gallery by Mr. Salting.\r\n\r\nThe \"absolute joy in ugliness,\" which Ruskin finds most strongly\r\nexemplified in some of Schongauer's prints (_Modern Painters_, vol.\r\niv. pt. v. ch. xix. § 18), is not altogether absent from this picture.\r\nA more unpleasant bedchamber, with its unseemly crowd of fat bustling\r\napostles (notice the old fellow puffing away at a censer on the left),\r\nit would be hard to conceive. One is glad to escape through the open\r\nwindow to the pretty little view of the square.\r\n\r\n\r\n659. PAN AND SYRINX.\r\n\r\n  _Johann Rottenhammer_ (German: 1564-1623).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      This painter was born at Munich. Early in life he went to Rome,\r\n      where he obtained some reputation. He next went to Venice,\r\n      where he executed some pictures in imitation of Tintoretto,\r\n      who was then still living. On his return to his native country\r\n      he settled at Augsburg, and was much patronised by the Emperor\r\n      Rudolph II.\r\n\r\nThe nymph Syrinx, beloved by Pan and flying from his pursuit, takes\r\nrefuge among some bulrushes. The god, thinking to grasp her, finds only\r\nreeds in his hand--\r\n\r\n    And while he sighs his ill-success to find,\r\n    The tender canes were shaken by the wind,\r\n    And breathed a mournful air, unheard before,\r\n    That, much surprising Pan, yet pleased him more.\r\n\r\n  DRYDEN, from Ovid's _Metamorphoses_.\r\n\r\nHe formed the reeds into a pipe, hence the name of Syrinx given to the\r\n\"Pan's pipe,\" see 94. The background of this picture (which is executed\r\non copper) is said to be by Jan Brueghel (for whom see 1287).\r\n\r\n\r\n660. A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to François Clouet_ (French: about 1510-1572).\r\n\r\n      François Clouet, like his father Jeannet before him, was\r\n      court painter to the King of France. Jeannet was, however,\r\n      probably a Netherlander; and François remained faithful to the\r\n      old northern style of painting. This and the other portrait\r\n      ascribed to him might well be taken for works of the Flemish\r\n      school.\r\n\r\nIn the costume of the 16th century: dated 1543.\r\n\r\n\r\n661. THE MADONNA DI SAN SISTO.\r\n\r\n  _After Raphael_. (See _under_ 1171.)\r\n\r\nA tracing from the original picture by Raphael at Dresden, by Jakob\r\nSchlesinger (1793-1855)--a Professor of Painting at Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n663. THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\n  _Fra Angelico_ (Florentine: 1387-1455).\r\n\r\n      Artists may be divided according to the subjects of their\r\n      choice into Purists, Naturalists, and Sensualists. The first\r\n      take the good in the world or in human nature around them\r\n      and leave the evil; the second render all that they see,\r\n      sympathising with all the good, and yet confessing the evil\r\n      also; the third perceive and imitate evil only (_Stones of\r\n      Venice_, vol. ii. ch. vi. § 51). Of the first class Fra\r\n      Giovanni da Fiesole is the leading type. His life was largely\r\n      spent in the endeavour to imagine the beings of another\r\n      world.[158] His baptismal name was Guido, but he changed it\r\n      early in life to Giovanni, when he entered a Dominican convent\r\n      in Florence. He was once offered the archbishopric of his city,\r\n      but he refused it: \"He who practises the art of painting,\"\r\n      he said, \"has need of quiet, and should live without cares\r\n      and anxieties; he who would do the work of Christ must dwell\r\n      continually with Him.\" He was given the name of \"Angelico,\"\r\n      and after his death the style and distinction of \"Beato\" (the\r\n      Blessed), for his purity and heavenly-mindedness, and it\r\n      is said of him that \"he was never known to be angry, or to\r\n      reprove, save in gentleness and love. Nor did he ever take\r\n      pencil in hand without prayer, and he could not paint the\r\n      Passion of Christ without tears of sorrow.\" By this \"purity of\r\n      life, habitual elevation of thought, and natural sweetness of\r\n      disposition, he was enabled to express the sacred affections\r\n      upon the human countenance as no one ever did before or since.\r\n      In order to effect clearer distinction between heavenly beings\r\n      and those of this world, he represents the former as clothed\r\n      in draperies of the purest colour, crowned with glories of\r\n      burnished gold, and entirely shadowless. With exquisite choice\r\n      of gesture, and disposition of folds of drapery, this mode of\r\n      treatment gives, perhaps, the best idea of spiritual beings\r\n      which the human mind is capable of forming. It is, therefore,\r\n      a true ideal; but the mode in which it is arrived at (being\r\n      so far mechanical and contradictory of the appearances of\r\n      nature) necessarily precludes those who practise it from\r\n      being complete masters of their art. It is always childish,\r\n      but beautiful in its childishness\" (_Modern Painters_, vol.\r\n      iii. pt. iv. ch. vi. § 4). Angelico, it may be added, looking\r\n      on his work as an inspiration from God, never altered or\r\n      improved his designs when once completed, saying that \"such\r\n      was the will of God.\" Angelico's work, says Ruskin in a later\r\n      passage, in which he discusses the weakness of the monastic\r\n      ideal, will always retain its power, \"as the gentle words of\r\n      a child will.\" Yet \"the peculiar phenomenon in his art is,\r\n      to me, not its loveliness, but its weakness.... Of all men\r\n      deserving to be called great, Fra Angelico permits to himself\r\n      the least pardonable faults and the most palpable follies.\r\n      There is evidently within him a sense of grace and power of\r\n      invention as great as Ghiberti's; ... [but] comparing him with\r\n      contemporary great artists of equal grace and invention, one\r\n      peculiar character remains noticeable in him--which, logically,\r\n      we ought therefore to attribute to the religious fervour;--and\r\n      that distinctive character is, the contented indulgence of\r\n      his own weaknesses, and perseverance in his own ignorances.\"\r\n      Passing to consider the sources of the peculiar charm which\r\n      we nevertheless feel in Angelico's work, Ruskin mentions\r\n      \"for one minor thing, an exquisite variety and brightness of\r\n      ornamental work\"; while \"much of the impression of sanctity\"\r\n      is \"dependent on a singular repose and grace of gesture,\r\n      consummating itself in the floating, flying, and, above all,\r\n      in the dancing groups\" (_Ethics of the Dust_, pp. 150-152).\r\n      Fra Angelico is said to have begun his artistic career as an\r\n      illuminator of manuscripts--a tradition which is entirely in\r\n      accordance with the style of his later works. In 1409 he left\r\n      Fiesole for Foligno and Cortona. In the churches of the latter\r\n      place fine altar-pieces by him are still preserved. From 1418\r\n      to 1436 he was again at Fiesole. In the latter year he was\r\n      invited to Florence to decorate the new Convent of St. Mark.\r\n      His frescoes here occupied him nine years. \"This convent, now\r\n      converted into a national monument, is a very museum of Fra\r\n      Angelico--cloisters, refectory, chapter-house, guest-room,\r\n      corridor, stairs, and not less than nineteen or twenty cells,\r\n      bear witness to a skill and leisure alike obsolete.\" Copies of\r\n      several of the frescoes may be seen in the Arundel Society's\r\n      collection. In 1445 Fra Angelico was called to Rome, where he\r\n      painted the chapel of Nicolas V. in the Vatican (also copied\r\n      and engraved for the Arundel Society). At Orvieto in 1447 he\r\n      commenced some paintings in the chapel of the Madonna di San\r\n      Brixio, which were afterwards completed by Signorelli. The last\r\n      years of the painter's life were spent at Rome. He was buried\r\n      in the Church of the Minerva, where his recumbent effigy (an\r\n      emaciated figure in the Dominican habit) may still be seen.\r\n      \"Some works are for Earth,\" says a line in his Latin epitaph,\r\n      \"others for Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe weakness and the strength of the painter are alike well seen in\r\nthis picture of Christ, with the banner of the resurrection surrounded\r\nby the Blessed. The representation of Christ Himself is weak and devoid\r\nof dignity; but what can be more beautiful than the surrounding angel\r\nchoirs, \"with the flames on their white foreheads waving brighter as\r\nthey move, and the sparkles streaming from their purple wings like\r\nthe glitter of many suns upon a sounding sea, listening in the pauses\r\nof alternate song for the prolonging of the trumpet blast, and the\r\nanswering of psaltery and cymbal, throughout the endless deep, and\r\nfrom all the star shores of heaven\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. ii. pt.\r\niii. sec. ii. ch. v. § 21).[159] No two of the 266 figures are alike\r\nin face or form, though each is perfect in grace and beauty.[160] In\r\nthe central compartment the seraphim (red) are on Christ's right, the\r\ncherubim (blue) on His left. In the compartment to Christ's left are,\r\namongst other patriarchs and saints, Abraham with the sword, Noah\r\nwith the ark, Moses with the tables of law, Aaron with his name on his\r\nmitre, and below them St. Agnes with the Lamb, and St. Catherine with\r\nher wheel. The martyrs bear palms in their hands; some wear wreaths\r\nof roses, others the crown of thorns. In the compartment to Christ's\r\nleft are the Virgin, St. Peter with the keys, and the Evangelists. On\r\nthe extreme ends on either side are those of the painter's brother\r\nDominicans, in their black robes, who have joined the company of the\r\n\"Blessed.\"\r\n\r\n    Multitudes--multitudes--stood up in bliss,\r\n      Made equal to the angels, glorious, fair;\r\n    With harps, palms, wedding-garments, kiss of peace,\r\n      And crowned and haloed hair.\r\n\r\n    Each face looked one way like a moon new-lit,\r\n      Each face looked one way toward its Sun of Love;\r\n    Drank love, and bathed in love, and mirrored it,\r\n      And knew no end thereof.\r\n\r\n    Glory touched glory, on each blessèd head,\r\n      Hands locked dear hands never to sunder more:\r\n    These were the new-begotten from the dead\r\n      Whom the great birthday bore.\r\n\r\n  CHRISTINA ROSSETTI: _From House to Home_.\r\n\r\nThis picture was formerly the predella of an altar-piece in San\r\nDomenico at Fiesole. It was sold by the monks in 1826 to the Prussian\r\nConsul in Rome, from whose nephew it was purchased for our Gallery.\r\n\"The price paid was £3500. The additional and incidental expenses, in\r\nconsequence of the demands of the Roman Government before allowing the\r\nexportation, were unusually great. Those demands, ostensibly founded\r\non the excellence and celebrity of the picture, were admitted to be\r\npartly also suggested by the state of the Papal finances.\" The British\r\nConsul finally paid £700 for the permission of exportation (_Director's\r\nReport_, 1861). The altar-piece to which our picture belonged remains\r\nsadly damaged _in situ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n664. THE DEPOSITION IN THE TOMB.\r\n\r\n  _Roger van der Weyden_[161] (Early Flemish: 1400-1464).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xix)\r\n\r\n      This painter was born at Tournai, where he was known as Rogelet\r\n      de la Pasture. He afterwards went to Brussels, where he\r\n      assumed his Flemish name, and where in 1436 he was appointed\r\n      town painter. For the Hall of Justice there he painted four\r\n      pictures, which are now lost, but of which the designs are\r\n      preserved in a set of tapestries in Berne Cathedral. He was\r\n      the chief master (as a teacher, that is) of the early Flemish\r\n      school. It was he who carried Flemish art into Italy (see\r\n      772), where he was in 1449-1450. \"Contemporary Italian writers\r\n      laud the pathos, the brilliant colouring, and the exhaustive\r\n      finish of his works.\" He on his side gained something from the\r\n      study of Italian masters. The composition of many of his great\r\n      works--_e.g._ \"The Last Judgment\" at Beaune, the \"Nativity\"\r\n      at Berlin, and \"The Adoration of the Magi\" at Munich--bears\r\n      evidence of Italian influence. Nearer home, the school of the\r\n      Lower Rhine in its later time was an offshoot of his school:\r\n      and farther up the river, Martin Schongauer, at Colmar, was\r\n      an immediate pupil of his. He set the fashions in several\r\n      subjects--such as descents from the cross, and hundreds of\r\n      followers imitated his designs. What gave his art this wide\r\n      currency was the way in which it united the older religious\r\n      feeling, from which Van Eyck had cut himself adrift, with\r\n      the new naturalism and improved technique which Van Eyck had\r\n      introduced. His French blood, too, gave his art an element of\r\n      vivid emotion, which was lacking in the staid control of Van\r\n      Eyck. He is especially praised for his \"representations of\r\n      human desires and dispositions, whether grief, pain, or joy.\"\r\n      He thus painted for the religious needs of the people at large;\r\n      and though an inferior artist, enjoyed a far wider influence\r\n      than Van Eyck. \"Less intensely realistic than Van Eyck, less\r\n      gifted with the desire and the power to reproduce the phenomena\r\n      of nature for their own sake, and in their completeness, he\r\n      thought more,\" says Sir F. Burton, \"of expressing the feelings\r\n      common to him and the pious worshippers for whose edification\r\n      he wrought. His figures exhibit deep, if sometimes rather\r\n      overstrained, pathos. He strove with naïf earnestness to bring\r\n      home to the senses the reality of the incidents connected with\r\n      the last sufferings and death of the Saviour. Still he was\r\n      naturalistic too, in the sense in which that term applies to\r\n      all painters of the early Flemish school, in that he imitated\r\n      with minuteness every object which he thought necessary to his\r\n      compositions; but of the broad principles of chiaroscuro and\r\n      subordination which Van Eyck had so wonderfully grasped, he\r\n      had small perception. His scenes seem filled with the light of\r\n      early morning. His colour, pale in the flesh-tints with greyish\r\n      modelling, is varied and delicately rich in the clothing and\r\n      other stuffs introduced. His landscape abounds in freshness\r\n      and greenth. Thus he transferred to his oil pictures the light\r\n      and brilliance of missal painting, an art which perhaps he had\r\n      himself practised.\" \"He occasionally practised a very different\r\n      technical method from that usually employed in Flanders--that\r\n      is to say, he painted in pure tempera colours on unprimed\r\n      linen, the flesh tints especially being laid on extremely\r\n      thin, so that the texture of the linen remains unhidden. Other\r\n      colours, such as a smalto blue used for draperies, are applied\r\n      in greater body, and the whole is left uncovered by any\r\n      varnish\" (Middleton). Of this method the present picture is a\r\n      fine example.\r\n\r\nThis picture--\"one of the most exquisite in feeling of the early\r\nFlemish school\" (Poynter)--is full of sincere emotion. \"Roger van der\r\nWeyden is especially known by his touching conception of some of the\r\nscenes of the Passion. He excelled in the lull of suppressed feeling.\r\nThe picture of the Entombment by him in the National Gallery is as\r\nmuch more sad to the heart than the passionate Italian conception,\r\nas a deep sigh sometimes than a flood of tears. We could almost\r\nwish those mourners, with their compressed lips, red eyelids, and\r\nslowly trickling tears, would weep more--it would grieve us less. But\r\nevidently the violence of the first paroxysm of grief is over, and\r\nthis is the exhaustion after it. The tide is ebbing as with all new\r\nsorrow, too soon to flow again. No finer conception of manly sorrow,\r\nsternly repressed, exists than in the heads of Nicodemus and Joseph of\r\nArimathea, who devote themselves the more strenuously to their task in\r\norder to conceal their grief. Strange that a painter of such exquisite\r\nrefinement of feeling should adhere to so hideous a type of Christ as\r\nthat which appears here\" (Mrs. Jameson's _History of our Lord_, ii.\r\n246). It is interesting to contrast the figure of Christ with that in\r\nFrancia's picture (180). In painting such subjects the Italians of the\r\nbest time endured the physical painfulness, the Northern temperament\r\nrejoiced in it. The painters in so doing were only meeting the wishes\r\nof their patrons. There is a contract, for instance, still in existence\r\nin which it is expressly stipulated that the form of our Lord in a\r\npicture ordered at Bruges shall be painted \"in all respects like a dead\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n665. THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Piero della Francesca_ (Umbrian: about 1416-1492).\r\n\r\n      This great Umbrian master was a native of Borgo San Sepolcro in\r\n      Umbria, but studied in Florence, where it is probable that he\r\n      was a pupil of Paolo Uccello (see 583). A combination of the\r\n      characteristics of the two schools is to be seen in the work\r\n      of Piero, who had at the same time a marked individuality of\r\n      his own. \"He has the imaginative impulse, the Umbrian sense\r\n      of an inner, an almost mystic beauty, of a certain aloofness\r\n      from earth and uplifting of the soaring spirit; and yet on\r\n      the other side of his character he is strongly scientific; he\r\n      studies perspective, the projection of shadows, the scheme\r\n      of values; he fills his work with light and atmosphere,\r\n      and improves on the oil methods of the earlier Florentines\"\r\n      (Brinton's _Renaissance in Italian Art_, iii. 85). \"By dignity\r\n      of portraiture, by loftiness of style, and by a certain\r\n      poetical solemnity of imagination he raised himself above the\r\n      level of the mass of his contemporaries. Those who have once\r\n      seen his fresco of the 'Resurrection' at Borgo San Sepolcro\r\n      [in the Pinacoteca] will never forget the deep impression\r\n      of solitude and aloofness from all earthly things produced\r\n      by it\" (Symonds, iii. 170). A copy of this fresco may be\r\n      seen in the Arundel Society's collection. The picture now\r\n      before us also well illustrates the skill in dealing with\r\n      technical difficulties and the solemn grandeur of conception\r\n      which characterise the painter. Piero della Francesca was\r\n      so called after his mother,[162] \"Francesca's Peter,\" for,\r\n      says Vasari, \"he had been brought up solely by herself, who\r\n      furthermore assisted him in the attainment of that learning\r\n      to which his good fortune had destined him.\" He received at\r\n      first a scientific education, and possessed, adds Vasari, \"a\r\n      considerable knowledge of Euclid, inasmuch that he understood\r\n      all the most important properties of rectilinear bodies better\r\n      than any other geometrician.\" In a treatise on perspective,\r\n      written in the vulgar tongue, he reduced the science to \"rules\r\n      which have hardly admitted of subsequent improvement.\" These\r\n      studies influenced Piero's tendencies in art. \"The laws of\r\n      aerial perspective, of the harmony of colours, the proportions\r\n      of light and shade, and the position of objects in space were\r\n      equally developed by one whose feeling for precise calculation\r\n      went _pari passu_ with that of pictorial representation.\r\n      In this combination of science and art he was strictly the\r\n      precursor of Leonardo da Vinci. Fra Luca Paccioli, a celebrated\r\n      mathematician, and an intimate friend of Piero, was in later\r\n      years in constant communication with Leonardo\" (Layard, i.\r\n      215). Piero probably acquired the new method of oil painting\r\n      from Domenico Veneziano (see 766), whom he assisted in some\r\n      wall paintings in S. Maria Nuova in Florence in 1439, and with\r\n      whom he afterwards worked at Loreto. Some of his best works\r\n      are to be seen in his native city, and at Arezzo he painted a\r\n      remarkable series of frescoes for the church of S. Francesco.\r\n      Piero was also employed at Urbino, where he appears to have\r\n      been the guest of Raphael's father, Giovanni Santi. He worked\r\n      also in Rimini and Ferrara, and was called to Rome to paint two\r\n      frescoes in the Vatican, which were afterwards destroyed to\r\n      make room for the works of Raphael. His later, like his earlier\r\n      years, were devoted to mathematical studies, and in his old\r\n      age \"the ban Of blindness struck both palette from his thumb\r\n      And pencil from his finger.\" Among his pupils Vasari mentions\r\n      Perugino and Signorelli.\r\n\r\nA picture of great interest from a technical point of view, as showing\r\nan advancing skill, especially in perspective. The feet of Christ\r\nare finely \"foreshortened\"; the tops of the mountains are correctly\r\nreflected on the surface of the river in the foreground; in the\r\nmiddle distance there is a foreshortened view of a street leading to\r\na fortified town, and the anatomy of the figure stripping himself for\r\nbaptism is very carefully rendered. This very realistic figure of a\r\nconvert strikes a curious note; Piero's paintings are \"the working\r\nout of problems before our very eyes.\" In these technical respects\r\nPiero resembles Paolo Uccello, while there is also a striking affinity\r\nof style between the landscapes of the two painters. \"The peculiar\r\nconstruction of these landscapes, with steep mountains of an uncommon\r\ntype, is the more remarkable because they are the starting-point\r\nof all the later achievements in realistic landscape painting\"\r\n(Richter's _Italian Art in the National Gallery_, p. 16). \"The study\r\nof natural phenomena,\" says Mr. Monkhouse, \"is everywhere apparent.\r\nThe pomegranate trees are the earliest attempt in the National Gallery\r\nto give what may be called the portrait of a particular tree--the\r\nhabit of its growth, the special character of its leafage. The hedge\r\nin Uccello's 'Battle of St. Egidio' is the nearest approach to it. He\r\nhas striven to imagine the scene as it actually might have happened.\r\nSundry worthies, in strange rich costumes, look on from a further\r\nbank. Nothing is 'newer' in the picture than the carefully studied\r\nreflections of their garments in the water. The effect, so beautifully\r\nrendered by Burne-Jones in his picture of 'Venus's Looking-Glass,'\r\nPiero was the first to paint, if not to observe\" (_In the National\r\nGallery_, p. 106).\r\n\r\nThe subject is the baptism in Jordan. Christ, under the shade of a\r\npomegranate tree, is being \"baptized of John in Jordan; and straightway\r\ncoming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit\r\nlike a dove descending upon him\" (Mark i. 9, 10). The spiritual feeling\r\nof the scene is enhanced by the sweet presence of the attendant\r\nangels,--crowned with wreaths of flowers, instead of the nimbus. It is\r\nan old belief that angels watch over men's birth, and so too they are\r\nrepresented as presiding over the new birth, which is typified by the\r\nrite of baptism. \"What solemnity in the bearing of Christ as He permits\r\nJohn to pour over Him the water of Jordan which is flowing in a shallow\r\nstream at his feet! How modest the deportment of the assistant angels\r\nat His side! How the trees, whose every leaf in the dense foliage is\r\ndistinctly outlined, seem even to hush their whispers that nothing may\r\ndisturb the nearness of God, who looking down from heaven as out of the\r\nfar distance, makes his presence felt\" (Grimm's _Life of Raphael_, p.\r\n46). This picture, which seems never to have been finished and shows\r\nthe under-painting, was formerly the principal altar-piece of the\r\nPriory of St. John the Baptist at Borgo San Sepolcro.\r\n\r\n\r\n666. THE ANNUNCIATION.\r\n\r\n  _Fra Filippo Lippi_ (Florentine: about 1406-1469).\r\n\r\n    I am poor brother Lippo, by your leave!...\r\n    Yes, I'm the painter, since you style me so....\r\n    For me, I think I speak as I was taught;\r\n    I always see the garden and God there\r\n    A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned,\r\n    The value and significance of flesh,\r\n    I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards....\r\n    Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn,\r\n    Left foot and right foot, go a double step,\r\n    Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,\r\n    Both in their order?\r\n\r\n  BROWNING: _Fra Lippo Lippi_.\r\n\r\n      This and the companion picture by the same artist (667) were\r\n      painted for Cosmo de' Medici (this one is marked with Cosmo's\r\n      crest--three feathers tied together in a ring), and are\r\n      identified with a story told by Vasari, which Browning worked\r\n      up in his poem on the artist. Cosmo, knowing the artist's ways,\r\n      kept him under lock and key that his work might be the quicker\r\n      done, but Lippi one night contrived a way of escape, and \"from\r\n      that time forward,\" adds Vasari, \"Cosmo gave the artist more\r\n      liberty, and was by this means more promptly and effectually\r\n      served by the painter, and was wont to say that men of genius\r\n      were not beasts of burden, but forms of light.\" Filippo was\r\n      the son of a butcher, and, being left an orphan, was committed\r\n      to the charge of the monks of the Carmelite convent close to\r\n      which his parents had lived. At the age of fourteen or fifteen\r\n      he was induced to take the vows of the order. At this time he\r\n      must have seen Masaccio painting in the famous Branacci chapel\r\n      of the conventual church, S. M. del Carmine. Lippi himself\r\n      executed some works (now destroyed) in the church, and having\r\n      by this time found his true vocation, he was in 1431 permitted\r\n      to leave the convent in order to be free to practise his art.\r\n      Vasari relates that during an excursion on the Adriatic, Lippi\r\n      was taken captive by some Moorish pirates. But after a while\r\n      he found opportunity to draw a whole-length portrait of his\r\n      master with charcoal on a white wall, which the pirates deemed\r\n      so marvellous that they set him at liberty. This tale, however,\r\n      is inconsistent with the facts of Lippi's life as now known\r\n      from documentary evidence. Lippi enjoyed the patronage of the\r\n      Medici, and he received sinecure offices also from the Pope.\r\n      During the years 1431-53 many of his best panel pictures were\r\n      painted. Among these may be mentioned the \"Coronation of the\r\n      Virgin\" (Academy, Florence), in which is introduced a portrait\r\n      of himself with the tonsure, and bearing a scroll inscribed\r\n      _Is perfecit opus_, and the \"Virgin adoring the Infant, borne\r\n      by two Angels\" (Uffizi), which was selected by Ruskin for\r\n      one of his four \"Lesson Photographs,\" and is fully described\r\n      by him in _Fors_, 1875, p. 307. At the end of the period in\r\n      question Lippi undertook the principal work of his life, which\r\n      occupied him for several years, the series of frescoes in the\r\n      choir of the Duomo at Prato. \"These magnificent paintings,\"\r\n      says Morelli, \"were executed at about the same time as those\r\n      equally celebrated by Mantegna in the Cappella degli Eremitani\r\n      at Padua. Whoever would learn to know the aspirations and\r\n      artistic power of that period in the highest utterances, has\r\n      only to study those two wall-paintings. If we are carried away\r\n      by Fra Filippo's grandeur of conception and his pure dramatic\r\n      vividness, we are enthralled, on the other hand, by Mantegna's\r\n      greater fulness of expression and his perfect execution\"\r\n      (_German Galleries_, p. 71). While engaged on these frescoes,\r\n      the friar-painter was appointed chaplain to the convent of\r\n      Santa Margherita. Here he became enamoured of one of the nuns,\r\n      Lucrezia Buti, and having persuaded the abbess to let Lucrezia\r\n      sit to him for a study of the Madonna, he carried her off\r\n      to his house. She remained with him for two years, and bore\r\n      him a son, the renowned painter, Filippino Lippi (293). Her\r\n      portrait is to be seen in the Virgin of the \"Assumption,\" now\r\n      in the Communal Gallery at Prato. She was induced to return to\r\n      the convent, and took fresh vows, but again escaped to seek\r\n      the friar's protection. The scandal now became serious, and\r\n      Filippo was threatened with punishment. But Cosmo de' Medici\r\n      intervened, and the Pope issued a bull releasing the erring\r\n      pair from their vows and sanctioning their marriage. Lippi's\r\n      last work was a series of frescoes in the choir of the Duomo\r\n      at Spoleto. Here he died, from an illness ascribed by some to\r\n      poison, leaving the work to be finished by his assistant, Fra\r\n      Diamante. He was buried in the Duomo. Over his tomb Lorenzo de'\r\n      Medici caused a monument to be erected, and Poliziano wrote\r\n      Latin couplets to commemorate the fame of the friar-painter.\r\n      \"His art,\" says Ruskin, \"is the finest, out and out, that\r\n      ever monk did, which I attribute myself to what is usually\r\n      considered faultful in him, his having run away with a pretty\r\n      novice out of a convent.... The real gist of the matter is that\r\n      Lippi did, openly and bravely, what the highest prelates in the\r\n      Church did basely and in secret; also he loved, where they only\r\n      lusted; and he has been proclaimed therefore by them--and too\r\n      foolishly believed by us--to have been a shameful person\"[163]\r\n      (_Fors Clavigera_, 1872, xxii. 4; _Ariadne Florentina_, vi.\r\n      § 5 _n._). In other words, Lippi, while true to his religion,\r\n      did not shut himself out from the world--to use the theological\r\n      language, he \"sanctified,\" not \"crucified,\" the flesh. His\r\n      pictures are \"nobly religious work,--examples of the most\r\n      perfect unison of religious myth with faithful realism of human\r\n      nature yet produced in this world\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1876, p.\r\n      187). \"The human element, with him so naïve and spontaneous,\r\n      gives,\" says Burton, \"a singular charm to his works. His\r\n      colour is golden and broad, and his drapery finely cast and of\r\n      fascinatingly broken tones.\" Among his pupils (besides his son)\r\n      were Pesellino and Botticelli.\r\n\r\nHere the traditional legend of the Annunciation is faithfully adhered\r\nto, and there is much \"unusually mystic spiritualism of conception\" in\r\nthe dove, the Spirit of God, proceeding in rays of golden light from\r\nthe hand of an unseen Presence; but the painter delights to elaborate\r\nalso every element of human interest and worldly beauty. Note, for\r\ninstance, the prettiness of the angel's face, the gracefulness of\r\nhis figure, the sheen of his wings, and the dainty splendour of the\r\nVirgin's chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n667. ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST AND SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Fra Filippo Lippi_ (Florentine: 1406-1469). _See 666._\r\n\r\nLippi's general characteristics, noticed above under the companion\r\npicture (666), may again be seen here. The \"other saints\" are Sts.\r\nFrancis (on the spectator's right, with the stigmata), Lawrence, and\r\nCosmas; on the left Sts. Damianus, Anthony, and Peter Martyr--this\r\nlast a particularly \"human\" saint. Lippi was a monk himself, and drew\r\nhis saints in the human resemblance of good \"brothers\" that he knew.\r\n\"I will tell you what Lippi must have taught any boy whom he loved.\r\nFirst, humility, and to live in joy and peace, injuring no man--if\r\nsuch innocence might be. Nothing is so manifest in every face by him\r\nas its gentleness and rest.\" It is characteristic of Lippi, too,\r\nthat the saints should be represented sitting in so pretty a garden.\r\nSecondly,--\"a little thing it seems, but was a great one,--love of\r\nflowers. No one draws such lilies or such daisies as Lippi. Botticelli\r\nbeat him afterwards in roses, but never in lilies\" (_Ariadne\r\nFlorentina_, vi. § 9).\r\n\r\n\r\n668. THE BEATO FERRETTI.\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Crivelli_ (Venetian: painted 1468-1493). _See 602._\r\n\r\nGabriele Ferretti (to whose family Pope Pius IX. belonged) was Superior\r\nof the Franciscans in the March of Ancona, and died in 1456. Thirty\r\nyears later his body was found incorrupt, and was deposited in a\r\nsarcophagus in the church of S. Francesco ad Alto at Ancona. It is\r\nconjectured that the present picture was painted for that church in\r\ncommemoration of the discovery of the body. The artist shows us the\r\nholy man in enjoyment of the vision of the beatified. \"The Beato (in\r\nFranciscan habit) has been reading or praying, at the entrance of a\r\ncave near a church, in a quiet country spot from which a road leads to\r\na town in the distance. Suddenly in the sky the Virgin and Child appear\r\n(surrounded by the _Vesica_ glory, see No. 564). He has laid down his\r\nbook, put off his sandals, and kneels in prayer and adoration.... The\r\nmasterly treatment of the drapery, the perfection of the forms, the\r\narchitecture, the sense of spaciousness in the landscape, all point\r\nto the maturity of Crivelli's art.... The landscape, for general\r\neffect, is one of his best, though the treatment of the rocks and of\r\nthe foreground is still conventional. The most striking objects in\r\nit are the leafless tree-stems, the counterpart, as it were, of the\r\nhard and bony human figures of which he was so fond, and therefore\r\nan illustration of his love for anatomical forms. His seeking after\r\nrealism again appears in the two ducks painted with minute precision.\r\nIn contrast to them we get the festoon of fruit at the top of the\r\npicture, illustrating the conventional and decorative aspect of his\r\nart. No picture of his suggests more completely both the range and the\r\nlimitations of Crivelli\" (G. M. Rushforth: _Carlo Crivelli_, pp. 65,\r\n87).\r\n\r\n\r\n669. ST. SEBASTIAN, ST. ROCH AND ST. DEMETRIUS.\r\n\r\n  _L'Ortolano_ (Ferrarese: died about 1525).\r\n\r\n      Giambattista Benvenuti, called L'Ortolano (the gardener) from\r\n      his father's occupation, is still a problem in art history,\r\n      details of his life being so uncertain that even the existence\r\n      of him is disputed by some critics. There is, however,\r\n      documentary evidence which proves his existence. This noble\r\n      picture was, until 1844, the altar-piece of the parochial\r\n      church of Bondeno, near Ferrara, where it was generally\r\n      considered the painter's masterpiece. His life and works are\r\n      generally confounded with those of Garofalo, to which painter\r\n      Morelli ascribes the present work. \"Garofalo's characteristics\r\n      are apparent in the form of hand, the brown flesh-tints, the\r\n      drapery, the landscape, and the small stones in the foreground\"\r\n      (_Italian Painters_: The Borghese and Doria-Pamfili Galleries\r\n      in Rome, p. 208). On the other hand, Venturi has drawn up\r\n      a list of works, showing common characteristics and common\r\n      differences from Garofalo, which he therefore attributes to\r\n      Ortolano. To this list should be added Lord Wimborne's \"St.\r\n      Joseph presenting the Infant Christ.\" Among the characteristics\r\n      noticeable in our picture are houses planted on posts; long,\r\n      straight streaks in the background turning to white; trees with\r\n      large, sparse, yellowing leaves. \"Garofalo never achieved the\r\n      rapt expression of St. Demetrius\" (see the argument of Venturi\r\n      quoted in Burlington Fine Arts Club's Catalogue, 1894).\r\n\r\nIn the centre is St. Sebastian, tied to a tree, and pierced with\r\narrows; whilst in the foreground is a cross-bow, lying uselessly. For\r\nthe story is that Sebastian was a noble youth who was promoted to the\r\ncommand of a company in the Prætorian Guards by the Emperor Diocletian:\r\n\r\n      \"At this time he was secretly a Christian, but his faith only\r\n      rendered him more loyal to his masters; more faithful in all\r\n      his engagements; more mild, more charitable; while his favour\r\n      with his prince, and his popularity with the troops, enabled\r\n      him to protect those who were persecuted for Christ's sake,\r\n      and to convert many to the truth. Among his friends were two\r\n      young men of noble family, soldiers like himself; their names\r\n      were Marcus and Marcellinus.\" And when they were tortured for\r\n      being Christians, Sebastian, \"neglecting his own safety, rushed\r\n      forward, and, by his exhortations, encouraged them rather to\r\n      die than to renounce their Redeemer. Then Diocletian ordered\r\n      that Sebastian also should be bound to a stake and shot to\r\n      death with arrows. The archers left him for dead; but in the\r\n      middle of the night, Irene, the widow of one of his martyred\r\n      friends, came with her attendants to take his body away, that\r\n      she might bury it honourably; and it was found that none of\r\n      the arrows had pierced him in a vital part, and that he yet\r\n      breathed. So they carried him to her house, and his wounds were\r\n      dressed; and the pious widow tended him night and day, until\r\n      he had wholly recovered\" (Mrs. Jameson: _Sacred and Legendary\r\n      Art_, 1850, pp. 343, 344).\r\n\r\nThis legend was one of the special favourites with the mediæval\r\npainters: \"the display of beautiful form, permitted and even\r\nconsecrated by devotion, is so rare in Christian representations, that\r\nwe cannot wonder at the avidity with which this subject was seized\"\r\n(_ibid._ p. 346). It is instructive to compare the noble use of the\r\nsubject made in this picture, in which the great technical skill\r\nof the painter is subordinate to the beautiful display of a sacred\r\nlegend, with the \"St. Sebastian\" of Pollajuolo (292), in which, as we\r\nhave seen, the subject is used solely--and painfully--for the display\r\nof such skill. With St. Sebastian is here represented, on his left,\r\nhis contemporary, St. Demetrius. He is clad in armour, for he also\r\nserved under Diocletian, being Proconsul of Greece, and like St.\r\nSebastian used his high office to preach Christ. On the other side is\r\nSt. Roch (for whose legend see 735). He is a much later saint (about\r\nA.D. 1300), and is associated with St. Sebastian as another patron of\r\nthe plague-stricken. Arrows have been from all antiquity the emblem\r\nof pestilence; and from the association of arrows with his legend,\r\nSt. Sebastian succeeded in Christian times to the honours enjoyed by\r\nApollo, in Greek mythology, as the protector against pestilence.\r\n\r\n\r\n670. A KNIGHT OF ST. STEPHEN.\r\n\r\n  _Angelo Bronzino_ (Florentine: 1502-1572). _See 649._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nHe wears the robes of his order (with a red cross bordered with\r\nyellow), an order established by Cosimo, Duke of Tuscany, and charged\r\nwith the defence of the coasts against pirates. The knight is a good\r\nspecimen of the courtier aristocracy with which Cosimo surrounded\r\nhimself. The knights of St. Stephen afterwards won much honour by their\r\nprowess, but they were men of culture also: notice that this one holds\r\na book in his hand, which rests on a table richly carved in the taste\r\nof the time. This portrait was presented to the nation by Mr. Watts,\r\nR.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n671. MADONNA AND CHILD ENTHRONED\r\n\r\n  _Garofalo_ (Ferrarese: 1481-1559). _See 81._\r\n\r\nThis fine picture was originally the principal altar-piece of\r\nthe church of San Guglielmo (St. William) at Ferrara. Hence the\r\nintroduction of that saint (on our left)--a beautiful face, into which\r\nthe artist has put, one may think, all his local piety. The saint\r\nis in armour, for William--the institutor of the hermit order of\r\nGuglielmites--was originally a soldier, and was \"given,\" says one of\r\nhis biographers, \"unto a licentious manner of living, too common among\r\npersons of that profession.\" It was to escape from such temptations\r\nthat he became a holy penitent, and fought thenceforward in mountain\r\nsolitudes, as a soldier of Christ against the flesh and the devil.\r\nBeside him stands St. Clara, \"the very ideal of a gray sister, sedate\r\nand sweet, sober, steadfast, and demure.\" She gazes on a crucifix, for\r\nshe too had renounced the pomps and vanities of the world. Her wealth\r\nof golden hair was cut off, it is said, by St. Francis; her fortune she\r\ngave to hospitals, and herself became the foundress of the Order of\r\n\"Poor Clares.\" St. Francis stands on the other side of the throne, and\r\nbesides him is \"good St. Anthony\" (see under 776).\r\n\r\n\r\n672. HIS OWN PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See 45._\r\n\r\n\"This portrait, dated 1640, describes the man well--strong and robust,\r\nwith powerful head, firm and compressed lips and determined chin, with\r\nheavy eyebrows, separated by a deep vertical furrow, and with eyes of\r\nkeen penetrating glance,--altogether a self-reliant man, who would\r\ncarry out his own ideas, careless whether his popularity waxed or\r\nwaned\" (J. F. White in _Encyclopædia Britannica_).\r\n\r\n\r\n673. \"SALVATOR MUNDI.\"\r\n\r\n  _Antonello da Messina_ (Venetian: 1444-1493)\r\n\r\n      A picture of special interest as being the earliest known\r\n      work (it is dated 1465) of Antonello, of Messina in Sicily,\r\n      who is famous as the man by whom the art of painting in oils,\r\n      as perfected by the Van Eycks (see 186), was introduced into\r\n      Venice. Vasari's story is that Antonello saw, on a visit to\r\n      Naples, a picture by John Van Eyck, in which the brilliancy\r\n      and fine fusion of the tints so struck him that he forthwith\r\n      set out for Flanders, ingratiated himself with Van Eyck, and\r\n      learnt from him the secret of his method. But the dates do\r\n      not agree with this story. For Van Eyck died in 1440, and\r\n      Antonello must therefore have been born early in the century,\r\n      whereas, on the contrary, Vasari expressly states that he died\r\n      in 1493, aged forty-nine. More probably Antonello learnt the\r\n      Flemish technique from the painters of that school who are\r\n      known to have been at Naples in the middle of the fifteenth\r\n      century. In his native town, in the church of S. Gregorio,\r\n      is a triptych by him, dated 1473. In the same year he was at\r\n      Venice, where he remained until his death. \"His practical\r\n      mastery of the new method, still unknown in the city of the\r\n      Lagoons, of glazing in oil colours a ground laid in tempera,\r\n      must have given Antonello a higher status at Venice than\r\n      his intrinsic merits as an artist would have warranted. We\r\n      see that he is at once honoured with a commission from the\r\n      wardens of S. Cassiano. Unhappily the altar-piece there, so\r\n      highly praised by Matteo Collaccio and Sabellico, and signed\r\n      with the year 1473, has long since disappeared. And not only\r\n      did the church dignitaries of Venice patronise him, but the\r\n      patricians were eager to have their likenesses taken on the\r\n      new principle practised by Antonello; and, to judge by the\r\n      number of portraits he turned out in those years, he must for\r\n      a time have been the most popular portrait painter in Venice\"\r\n      (Morelli). Of his portraits there is a good example in our\r\n      Gallery (1141). The splendid portrait in the Louvre is dated\r\n      1475; that in the Berlin Gallery, 1478. The \"Crucifixion\" in\r\n      our Gallery is dated 1477. \"It is evident to me,\" says Morelli,\r\n      \"that Antonello gradually formed himself by studying the works\r\n      and seeking the society of the great Venetian masters, till he\r\n      reached that degree of perfection which we miss in his early\r\n      Ecce Homos and admire in his portraits of 1475-78. His Italian\r\n      nature gradually works its way through the Flemish shell in\r\n      which his first master had encased his hand as well as mind. In\r\n      this transformation of Antonello as an artist Giovanni Bellini\r\n      had obviously the greatest share. Whoever visits the churches\r\n      of Messina, and of the towns and villages along that eastern\r\n      coast of Sicily as far as Syracuse, will still find in many\r\n      of them Madonnas, whether in colour or in marble, that remind\r\n      him of Antonello and Giambellino. And not only did Antonello\r\n      act powerfully on his own Sicilian countrymen; we also discern\r\n      his influence in several portraits by painters of Upper\r\n      Italy--for instance, those of Solario.\" No. 923, for example,\r\n      the portrait of a Venetian Senator, by that master, is strongly\r\n      reminiscent of Antonello's style. In fact, as Sir F. Burton\r\n      says, \"to Antonello and his Flemish education is due that type\r\n      of portraiture which we find among the Venetian and North\r\n      Italian painters of his time, and which, under a southern sun,\r\n      and in the hands of a Titian, expanded itself in the noblest\r\n      form.\" (The above account of Antonello follows Morelli: see his\r\n      _Italian Masters in German Galleries_, pp. 376-390).\r\n\r\nChrist as the \"Saviour of the World,\" stands with his finger on the\r\nedge of a parapet, giving the blessing and gazing into eternity. The\r\npicture, being dated 1465,[164] must have been painted by Antonello in\r\nhis twenty-first year. Both in conception and in the ruddy complexion\r\npeculiar to the school of Van Eyck (see 222 and 290) it suggests a\r\nFlemish influence. Notice also the _pentimenti_ (or corrections):\r\nthe right hand and border of the tunic were originally higher, and\r\ntheir forms, obliterated by the painter, have now in course of time\r\ndisappeared. This again shows the hand of an experienced artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n674. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Paris Bordone_ (Venetian: 1500-1570). _See 637._\r\n\r\nA splendid specimen of this painter's portraits, and a type of the\r\nface which meets one in nearly every Gallery of Europe; for Bordone,\r\nwho had (as we have seen) a great vogue as a lady's portrait painter,\r\nhad yet a way, says Ridolfi, of making such works appear more like\r\nfancy portraits than individual portraits. This one is of a girl of\r\nthe Brignole family, aged eighteen, according to the inscription. In\r\nthe Brignole Palace at Genoa (now the property of the town) are two\r\nmagnificent portraits by Bordone. The type here is that of a cruel and\r\nsomewhat sensual beauty--the eyes, especially, being, \"like Mars, to\r\nthreaten or command\"--\r\n\r\n    Cold eyelids that hide like a jewel\r\n      Hard eyes that grow soft for an hour;\r\n    The heavy white limbs, and the cruel\r\n      Red mouth like a venomous flower.\r\n\r\n  SWINBURNE: _Dolores_.\r\n\r\nSince the above note was written, Mr. H. Schütz Wilson has suggested,\r\nwith some plausibility, that the portrait is of Bianca Cappello\r\n(1542-1587), \"as pre-eminent in sumptuous voluptuous loveliness, as\r\nshe was in the crime of her day in Italy.\" \"In the deadly calm of the\r\nalmost inscrutable lineaments of this remarkable portrait, in which\r\ncharm and grace are shown behind so much that is terrible, so much\r\nthat is earthly, sensual, devilish, in those awful eyes, and in that\r\ncruel 'red mouth, like a venomous flower,' we see, as I fancy,\" says\r\nMr. Wilson, \"not an obscure girl of a noble family of Genoa, but the\r\ncounterfeit presentment of the romantically wicked Renaissance heroine,\r\nthe fair and evil Grand Duchess of Tuscany\" (_Pall Mall Gazette_,\r\nNovember 22, 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n679. THE PORTRAIT OF AN ASTRONOMER.\r\n\r\n  _Ferdinand Bol_ (Dutch: 1616-1680).\r\n\r\n      Bol was the most distinguished of Rembrandt's pupils in\r\n      portraiture. He was born at Dordrecht, and settled at\r\n      Amsterdam, where he acquired burgess rights in 1652. One of\r\n      Bol's portraits in the Louvre has attained the honour of being\r\n      hung in the Salon Carré. His \"Four Regents of the Leprosy\r\n      Hospital\" at Amsterdam is the painter's masterpiece, and one\r\n      of the finest works of the Dutch School. Bol's pictures are\r\n      remarkable for a prevailing yellow tone. Up to about the\r\n      year 1660 he seems to have remained the pupil of Rembrandt.\r\n      \"Unfortunately he did not remain faithful to his early\r\n      teaching. He made sacrifices to the taste of his time, and\r\n      abandoned the sober and grave figures, the severe and sustained\r\n      method of painting, the powerful light and shade of his school,\r\n      to seek a fresh source of success in overwhelming allegory and\r\n      in the imitation of Rubens. This was his ruin. His later works,\r\n      painted in full light, are very inferior to those of an earlier\r\n      date; their colouring is hard, glaring, and discordant, and\r\n      in composition they are frequently bombastic and pretentious\"\r\n      (Havard: _The Dutch School of Painting_, p. 93).\r\n\r\nThe sitter is conjectured to be an astronomer, from the globes on the\r\ntable before him and from the look on his face as of a man dwelling\r\namong the clouds. The picture is signed, and dated 1652.\r\n\r\n\r\n680. THE MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See 49._\r\n\r\nPainted by Van Dyck from the large picture by Rubens at Mechlin, for\r\nan engraver to work from. \"One of the too numerous brown sketches in\r\nthe manner of the Flemish School, which seem to me rather done for\r\nthe sake of wiping the brush clean than of painting anything. There\r\nis no colour in it, and no light and shade;--but a certain quantity\r\nof bitumen is rubbed about so as to slip more or less greasily into\r\nthe shape of figures; and one of St. John's (or St. James's) legs\r\nis suddenly terminated by a wriggle of white across it, to signify\r\nthat he is standing in the sea\" (_Art of England_, p. 44). Ruskin\r\nnotices the picture as an example of the art which was assailed by the\r\nPre-Raphaelites. A word-picture of the same scene in the Pre-Raphaelite\r\nmanner, with its literal and close realisation, will be found in\r\n_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. iv. § 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n685. SHOWERY WEATHER.\r\n\r\n  _Meindert Hobbema_ (Dutch: 1638-1709).\r\n\r\n      Hobbema, who disputes with Ruysdael the place of best Dutch\r\n      landscape painter, was a friend of the latter, and perhaps his\r\n      pupil: certainly works of the two are sometimes remarkably\r\n      alike. Thus it has been pointed out that Hobbema's No. 996\r\n      shows the influence of Ruysdael, whilst Ruysdael's No. 986\r\n      recalls Hobbema's. Often, too, they painted the same country;\r\n      compare _e.g._ No. 986 with Hobbema's No. 832. Like Ruysdael,\r\n      too, Hobbema was a painter without honour in his own country,\r\n      and nine-tenths of his known works are in England, where he was\r\n      first appreciated, and where he was the means of influencing\r\n      many of our landscape painters, notably Nasmyth. His pictures\r\n      were often ascribed to other painters, now considered greatly\r\n      his inferiors, in order to obtain better prices. It has been\r\n      remarked as a curious fact that until the middle of the\r\n      eighteenth century no engraver thought it worth while to\r\n      reproduce any of Hobbema's pictures; and Sir Joshua Reynolds\r\n      in his _Tour in Holland_ (1781) makes no reference to Hobbema,\r\n      though he must have seen some of his pictures. Even a hundred\r\n      years ago they were not much sought after; now they are more\r\n      valued than those of any landscape painter and fetch very\r\n      large prices at auctions. Recently one of them sold for as\r\n      much as £8820. This appreciation is due in part to the fact\r\n      that Hobbemas are very rare; the known works by him number\r\n      hardly more than a hundred. Of Hobbema's life very little\r\n      is recorded. His name (like that of Alma Tadema) betokens\r\n      Frisian origin. His birthplace is unknown, but he appears to\r\n      have been born at Amsterdam, and to have been the scholar of\r\n      Jacob Ruysdael in landscape painting. Ruysdael was the witness\r\n      at his marriage. This was in 1668. In the same year he was\r\n      appointed one of the sworn gaugers for the excise of the town.\r\n      \"Thus, a century before Burns, fortune played upon one of the\r\n      greatest of landscape painters the same trick that she played\r\n      in his case upon the most spontaneous of poets.\" Hobbema was\r\n      not the only painter of his time who had to eke out a bare\r\n      subsistence by employment more lucrative than the production\r\n      of masterpieces. Salomon van Ruysdael was also a frame-maker;\r\n      Van Goyen speculated in houses, picture-dealing, and tulips;\r\n      and Jan Steen was an innkeeper. The coincidence of Hobbema's\r\n      marriage and his appointment as gauger of wines and oil was not\r\n      by chance. The archives throw a curious light upon the public\r\n      morals of Amsterdam at the time of its greatest prosperity. By\r\n      a deed executed in the month of his marriage, Hobbema admits\r\n      that he owes his appointment to the influence of a companion\r\n      of his wife, like her a servant in the employment of the\r\n      burgomaster, and in consideration of this he agrees to pay her,\r\n      so long as he holds the place, an annual sum of 250 florins.\r\n      Posterity owes this servant of the burgomaster a grudge, for\r\n      after taking up the appointment, Hobbema scarcely painted\r\n      any more. The post cannot, however, have been lucrative, for\r\n      he died in evil circumstances--in a house directly opposite\r\n      to that in which Rembrandt had died forty years before. The\r\n      painter of works, any one of which is now worth a small fortune\r\n      to its possessor, was buried in a pauper's grave.\r\n\r\n      In spite of the resemblance to Ruysdael above noted, Hobbema's\r\n      best and most characteristic works are quite distinct.\r\n      Ruysdael is the painter of the solitude of nature, of rocks\r\n      and waterfalls; Hobbema of the Dutch \"fields with dwellings\r\n      sprinkled o'er.\" The pervading tone of Ruysdael is dark\r\n      and sombre; that of Hobbema is drowsy and still. A second\r\n      characteristic of Hobbema is his fondness for oak foliage, and\r\n      a certain \"nigglingness\" in his execution of it. See _e.g._\r\n      832, 833. \"They (Hobbema and Both) can paint oak leafage\r\n      faithfully, but do not know where to stop, and by doing too\r\n      much, lose the truth of all, lose the very truth of detail\r\n      at which they aim, for all their minute work only gives two\r\n      leaves to nature's twenty. They are evidently incapable of\r\n      even thinking of a tree, much more of drawing it, except leaf\r\n      by leaf; they have no notion nor sense of simplicity, mass,\r\n      or obscurity, and when they come to distance, where it is\r\n      totally impossible that leaves should be separately seen,\r\n      being incapable of conceiving or rendering the grand and quiet\r\n      forms of truth, they are reduced to paint their bushes with\r\n      dots and touches expressive of leaves three feet broad each.\"\r\n      \"No word,\" Ruskin elsewhere adds, \"has been more harmfully\r\n      misused than that ugly one of 'niggling.' I should be glad if\r\n      it were entirely banished from service and record. The only\r\n      essential question about drawing is whether it be right or\r\n      wrong; that it be small or large, swift or slow, is a matter of\r\n      convenience only. But so far as the word may be legitimately\r\n      used at all, it belongs especially to such execution as this\r\n      of Hobbema's--execution which substitutes, on whatever scale,\r\n      a mechanical trick or habit of hand for true drawing of known\r\n      or intended forms.\" A second objection to Hobbema's method may\r\n      be mentioned besides its \"trickiness.\" His \"niggling\" touch\r\n      is extended from the foreground to objects farther off, and\r\n      thus \"a middle distance of Hobbema involves a contradiction\r\n      in terms; it states a distance by perspective, which it\r\n      contradicts by distinctness of detail\" (_Modern Painters_, vol.\r\n      i. pt. ii. sec. ii. ch. v. § 17, sec. vi. ch. i. § 22; vol. v.\r\n      pt. vi. ch. v. § 6). In spite, however, of such defects, the\r\n      works of Hobbema have an enduring charm for their incisiveness\r\n      of touch, and warmth of light. He had not Ruysdael's variety\r\n      nor his depth of poetic feeling. The forest glade and the\r\n      watermill are almost all he paints. But these he paints so\r\n      firmly and decisively that they live for ever, and upon them he\r\n      casts a warm and golden tone which never fails to please.\r\n\r\n\r\n686. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Hans Memlinc_ (Early Flemish: 1430-1494).\r\n\r\n      It is only in the Hospital of St. John at Bruges that the art\r\n      of this exquisite painter can be properly studied. There,\r\n      as among the Fra Angelicos at San Marco in Florence and the\r\n      Giottos at the Arena in Padua, one may see the great works\r\n      of a mediæval painter in the very surroundings which first\r\n      produced them. (Copies of some of Memlinc's works at Bruges and\r\n      elsewhere are included in the Arundel Society's collection.)\r\n      The Hospital is, as it were, a shrine of Memlinc. Around this\r\n      fact legends grew. In one of the pictures, it was said, a\r\n      portrait of the artist might be discovered; on the sculptured\r\n      ornaments of a porch enframing one of its subjects, an incident\r\n      of the master's life might be traced,--his danger as he lay\r\n      senseless in the street, his rescue as charitable people\r\n      carried his body to the hospital. It came to be told how the\r\n      great artist began life as a soldier who went to the wars\r\n      under Charles the Bold, and came back riddled with wounds from\r\n      the field of Nancy. Wandering homeward in a disabled state in\r\n      1477, he fainted in the streets of Bruges, and was cured by\r\n      the Hospitallers. Unknown to them and a stranger to Bruges, he\r\n      gave tangible proofs of his skill to the brethren of St. John,\r\n      and showed his gratitude by refusing payment for a picture he\r\n      had painted. Unfortunately all this is a myth. Of his real life\r\n      little is known, but it is enough to refute the legends that\r\n      for so long passed current. In 1477 he was under contract to\r\n      furnish an altar-piece for the guild chapel of the booksellers\r\n      of Bruges; this picture, preserved under the name of the \"Seven\r\n      Griefs of Mary,\" is now one of the principal treasures of the\r\n      Gallery of Turin. His many pictures for the Hospitallers were\r\n      painted in 1479 and 1480. He was born at Mayence on the Rhine.\r\n      His name (which should not be spelt Memling) was probably\r\n      derived from the town of Memmelinck (now Medenblik) in the\r\n      north-east of Holland, to which place his family presumably\r\n      belonged. He is known from the town records to have been\r\n      settled in Bruges in his own house in 1479. He must have been\r\n      a citizen of some wealth, for in the next year he was one of\r\n      those who contributed to a loan raised by Maximilian of Austria\r\n      to push hostilities against France. In 1487 he lost his wife.\r\n      In 1494 he died, his children being still minors, and was\r\n      buried in the Church of St. Giles (see a document cited in the\r\n      _Athenæum_ of 2nd February 1889).\r\n\r\n      This is all that documentary evidence has disclosed about\r\n      Memlinc's life. If the evidence of his pictures may be taken,\r\n      his life must have been gentle and peaceful. For Memlinc's\r\n      place in the history of art is among the leaders of the\r\n      \"Purist\" School (see under 663). He was, we may say, the\r\n      Fra Angelico of Flanders. In technique he used the methods\r\n      perfected by the Van Eycks. \"In drawing a comparison between\r\n      Memlinc and his predecessors and contemporaries,[165] he\r\n      is found inferior to John Van Eyck in power of colour and\r\n      chiaroscuro, as well as in searching portraiture; to Van der\r\n      Weyden in dramatic force; to Dierick Bouts and Gheeraert\r\n      David in beauty and finish of landscape\" (Weale's monograph\r\n      on Memlinc, published by the Arundel Society). But Memlinc\r\n      had a sentiment and an ideal of his own to which none of his\r\n      Flemish contemporaries attained. \"Van Eyck saw with his eye,\r\n      Memlinc begins to see with his spirit. The one copied and\r\n      imitated; the other copies, imitates,--and transfigures. Van\r\n      Eyck, without any thought of an ideal, reproduced the virile\r\n      types which passed before his eyes. Memlinc dreams as he looks,\r\n      chooses what is most lovable and delicate in human forms, and\r\n      creates above all as his feminine type a choice being who was\r\n      unknown before his time, and has disappeared since. They are\r\n      women, but women seen according to the tender predilections\r\n      of a spirit in love with grace, nobility, beauty.\" Memlinc's\r\n      men, on the other hand, do not compare advantageously with Van\r\n      Eyck's. There is more vigour in the latter, more framework,\r\n      more muscle, more blood. \"Memlinc's art is very human, but\r\n      there is in it no trace of the villainies and atrocities of\r\n      his time. His ideal is his own. It foreshadowed perhaps the\r\n      Bellinis, the Botticellis, the Peruginos, but not Leonardo, nor\r\n      the Tuscans, nor the Romans of the Renaissance. Imagine in the\r\n      midst of the horror of the century a privileged spot, a sort of\r\n      angelic retreat where the passions are silenced and troubles\r\n      cease, where men pray and worship, where physical and moral\r\n      deformities are transfigured, where new sentiments come into\r\n      being and sweet usages grow up like the lilies: imagine this\r\n      and you will have an idea of the unique soul of Memlinc and of\r\n      the miracle which he works in his pictures\" (Fromentin: _Les\r\n      Maitres d'Autrefois_).\r\n\r\nIn front is a portrait of the donor of the picture. On the Virgin's\r\nleft is St. George with the dragon--not a very dreadful dragon,\r\neither--\"they do not hurt or destroy\" in the peaceful gardens that\r\nMemlinc fancied. Notice how the peaceful idea is continued in the man\r\nreturning to his pleasant home in the background to the left. The\r\nVirgin herself is typical of the feminine idea in early Flemish art.\r\n\"It must be borne in mind that the people of the fifteenth century\r\nstill lived in an age when the language of symbols was rich and widely\r\nunderstood.... The high forehead of the Virgin and wide arching brows\r\ntell of her intellectual power, her rich long hair figures forth\r\nthe fulness of her life, her slim figure and tiny mouth symbolise\r\nher purity, her mild eyes with their drooping eyelids discover her\r\ndevoutness, her bent head speaks of humility. The supreme and evident\r\nvirtue which reigns in all these Madonnas is an absolute purity of\r\nheart\" (Conway's _Early Flemish Painters_, pp. 109, 110).\r\n\r\n\r\n687. ST. VERONICA.\r\n\r\n  _Meister Wilhelm of Cologne_ (Early German: living in 1380).\r\n\r\n      A work of interest as being by the first artist who emerges\r\n      in the North as an individual painter--painting before his\r\n      time being a mere appendage of other arts and the work solely\r\n      of guilds. This \"Master William,\" who is mentioned in an old\r\n      chronicle as having \"painted a man as though he were alive,\"\r\n      was a native of Herle, near Cologne, and attained a prominent\r\n      position in the latter town.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this picture is the compassionate woman whose door\r\nChrist passed when bearing his cross to Calvary. Seeing the drops of\r\nagony on his brow she wiped his face with her napkin, and the true\r\nimage (_Vera Icon_: hence her name) of Christ remained miraculously\r\nimpressed upon it--the Christ-like deed thus imprinting itself and\r\nabiding ever with her. The subject of the picture gives it a further\r\nhistorical interest as being suggestive of the mystics, the \"Friends of\r\nGod,\" as they called themselves, who were preaching in the Rhine Valley\r\nat this time, and under whose influence this early school of painting\r\narose. \"The mystic is one who claims to be able to see God with the\r\ninner vision of the soul. He studies to be quiet that his still soul\r\nmay reflect the face of God\"--even as did the cloth of St. Veronica\r\n(Beard's _Hibbert Lectures_).\r\n\r\n\r\n690. \"HIS OWN PORTRAIT.\"[166]\r\n\r\n  _Andrea del Sarto_ (Florentine: 1486-1531).\r\n\r\n\r\n      The cabinet pictures of Andrea del Sarto, \"the faultless\r\n      painter,\" are well known to all visitors in the great galleries\r\n      of Europe. There is a certain mannerism in them which makes\r\n      them very easy of recognition. His type of Madonna is constant,\r\n      for it was taken from the beautiful wife whom he loved so\r\n      well, and who requited his love so ill. In his angels there\r\n      is a delicate, misty beauty; and over all his works there is\r\n      \"that peculiar softness, harmony, and delicacy of colouring\r\n      which the Italians call _morbidezza_, and which is to be\r\n      seen in its perfection in the 'Madonna di San Francesco' in\r\n      the Uffizi.\" That Holy Family (painted in 1517) is generally\r\n      considered his masterpiece, and may be taken as the supreme\r\n      type of similar pictures in all the galleries. Another typical\r\n      work is the \"Charity\" of the Louvre (painted 1518). But it is\r\n      only in Florence among his frescoes--now unhappily fading,\r\n      but preserved in part by copies in the Arundel Society's\r\n      collection--the frescoes of the Santissima Annunziata, the\r\n      convent of S. Salvi, and, above all, the cloister of the\r\n      Scalzo, that a full conception of Andrea's power can be\r\n      obtained. \"There only,\" says Mr. Swinburne, \"can one trace and\r\n      tell how great a painter and how various he was. There only,\r\n      but surely there, can the influence and pressure of the things\r\n      of time on his immortal spirit be understood.... In the little\r\n      cloister of the Scalzo there is such exultation and exuberance\r\n      of young power, of fresh passion and imagination, that only by\r\n      the innate grace can one recognise the hand of the master whom\r\n      hitherto we knew by the works of his after life, when the gift\r\n      of grace had survived the gift of invention. This and all other\r\n      gifts it did survive; all pleasure of life and power of mind.\r\n      All these his charm of touch, his sweetness of execution, his\r\n      'Elysian beauty, melancholy grace' outlived and blossomed in\r\n      their dust\" (Mr. Swinburne's eloquent piece on this painter's\r\n      works is in the first series of _Essays and Studies_, where\r\n      also are some notes on the master's drawings in the Uffizi\r\n      collection).\r\n\r\n      The painter's life is told in great detail and with much\r\n      vivacity by Vasari, to whose pages every reader should turn.\r\n      He was the pupil of Piero di Cosimo, and the friend and\r\n      fellow-worker of Franciabigio. All their spare, time, we are\r\n      told, was spent in drawing from the cartoons of Michelangelo\r\n      and Leonardo. \"After the exhibition of Michelangelo's\r\n      celebrated 'Cartoon of Pisa,' in 1506, he became a decided\r\n      imitator of that painter in design: in colour and light and\r\n      shade Fra Bartolommeo appears to have been his model.\" His\r\n      celebrated frescoes in the convent of the Annunziata (not\r\n      completed till 1514) were among his earliest works. Those in\r\n      the Scalzo were done in 1514. In 1517 he married, and in 1518\r\n      he went to Paris, returning to Florence in the following year.\r\n      The story that he embezzled sums of money given him by the king\r\n      for the purchase of pictures is open to suspicion, since the\r\n      accounts of the king have been discovered. No trace of such\r\n      moneys occurs, nor did the king ever make any effort to obtain\r\n      restitution. Andrea died of the plague at the early age of\r\n      forty-five.\r\n\r\nBrowning's poem, in which he sets forth the pathos of the artist's\r\nlife, is the best commentary on this beautiful portrait--so masterly\r\nin workmanship, so rich in suggestion of character. The real name of\r\nAndrea del Sarto--\"Andrew of the Tailor,\" so called from his father's\r\ntrade--was Andrea d'Agnolo: his monogram, formed of two inverted A's,\r\nmay here be seen on the background to the left. The Italians called him\r\n\"the faultless painter\": faultless, they meant, in all the technical\r\nrequirements of painting--\r\n\r\n              All is silver-grey,\r\n    Placid and perfect with my art.\r\n\r\nBut men may be \"faultily faultless\"; and what he lacked was just the\r\none thing needful--the consecration and the poet's dream, which lift\r\nmany works by less skilful hands than his into the higher region of\r\nimaginative art--\r\n\r\n    Their works drop groundward, but themselves, I know,\r\n    Reach many a time a heaven that's shut to me,...\r\n    My works are nearer heaven, but I sit here.\r\n\r\nAnd the self-reproach was not less bitter for the knowledge of \"what\r\nmight have been.\" There is a story that Michael Angelo visited his\r\nstudio, and said afterwards to Raphael--\r\n\r\n    \"Friend, there's a certain little sorry scrub\r\n    \"Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how,\r\n    \"Who, were he set to plan and execute\r\n    \"As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings,\r\n    \"Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!\"\r\n\r\nYet Andrea himself too was once pricked on by kings. Two pictures of\r\nhis had been sent to Francis I., who thereupon invited the painter to\r\nhis court. And there for a time he worked and was honoured; but in the\r\nmidst of it all he sat reading the letters which Lucrezia, his wife,\r\nsent him to Paris. \"You called me and I came home to your heart.\" It\r\nis her face which we see everywhere in Andrea's Madonnas, and if at\r\nany time he took his model from any other face, there was always a\r\nresemblance to hers in the painting--\r\n\r\n    You smile? why, there's my picture ready made!\r\n\r\nBut Lucrezia served as his model, not his ideal. She had been married\r\nbefore to a hatter, but was remarkable, says Vasari, who worked in\r\nAndrea's studio and had a grudge against her, \"as much for pride and\r\nhaughtiness, as for beauty and fascination.\"[167] And\r\n\r\n                    Had the mouth there urged\r\n    \"God and the glory! never care for gain....\r\n    \"Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo!\r\n    \"Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!\"\r\n    I might have done it for you. So it seems.\r\n\r\nIt is in some such mood of communing with himself that we seem here to\r\nsee the painter; yet there is a certain undercurrent of contentment\r\nbelow the look of melancholy. \"The force of a beautiful face carries me\r\nto heaven\": so sang Michael Angelo. Lucrezia dragged her husband down;\r\nhis rivals overcame him--\r\n\r\n    Because there's still Lucrezia,--_as I choose_.\r\n\r\n\r\n691. \"ECCE HOMO!\"\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Lo Spagna_ (Umbrian: painted 1503-1530).\r\n  _See 1032._\r\n\r\n\r\n602. ST. HUGO OF GRENOBLE.\r\n\r\n  _Lodovico of Parma_ (Parmese: early 16th century).\r\n\r\n      Said to have been a scholar of Francia.\r\n\r\nThe crozier shows him to be a bishop, and it is inscribed S. VGO. This\r\nis St. Hugo (died 1132), who was Bishop of Grenoble when St. Bruno\r\nfounded the Chartreuse, and who often resided amongst the Carthusians.\r\nDoubtless he was not an unwelcome visitor, for he had the power, it\r\nis said, of converting fowls into fish, which it was lawful to eat.\r\nFor forty years, it is further told of him, he had haunting doubts on\r\nthe old, old question of the origin of evil. The good bishop referred\r\nthem at last to Pope Gregory VII., who greatly comforted St. Hugo by\r\nassuring him that such doubts were only sent to try his virtue and\r\nfaith in the providence of God in permitting evil in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n693. ST. CATHERINE OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n  _Pinturicchio_ (Umbrian: 1454-1513).\r\n\r\n      Bernardino di Betto, or the son of Benedetto, was commonly\r\n      called Pinturicchio, \"the little painter.\" He is not strongly\r\n      represented in our Gallery. His principal works are the\r\n      decorated ceiling and frescoes in the Library of Siena, which\r\n      represent the life of the Pope Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (Pius\r\n      II.). A drawing of this Library and copies of some of the\r\n      frescoes are in the Arundel Society's Collection. Pinturicchio,\r\n      says Symonds, is \"a kind of Umbrian Gozzoli, who brings us\r\n      here and there in close relation to the men of his own time.\r\n      His wall-paintings in the library of the Cathedral of Siena\r\n      are so well preserved that we need not seek elsewhere for\r\n      better specimens of the decorative art most highly prized in\r\n      the first years of the 16th century. These frescoes have a\r\n      richness of effect and a vivacity of natural action which, in\r\n      spite of their superficiality, render them highly charming.\r\n      The life of Pius II. is treated like a legend. Both Pope and\r\n      Emperor are romantically conceived, and each portion of the\r\n      tale is told as though it were a part in some popular ballad.\r\n      So much remains of Perugian affectation as gives a kind of\r\n      childlike grace to the studied attitudes and many-coloured\r\n      groups of elegant young men\" (_Renaissance_, iii. 220). In\r\n      the foreground of one of the frescoes is a charming figure,\r\n      supposed to be a portrait of the young Raphael. Vasari states\r\n      and subsequent writers have repeated that Pinturicchio was\r\n      assisted in these frescoes by Raphael. This supposition rests\r\n      on three drawings attributed to Raphael, but now proved to be\r\n      by Pinturicchio, who bound himself to execute the whole work\r\n      with his own hand. Morelli's attribution to Pinturicchio of\r\n      the so-called \"Raphael's sketch-book\" at Venice is one of the\r\n      most important of that critic's discoveries. \"If (says Morelli)\r\n      in representing serious religious subjects, he does not come\r\n      up to Perugino as regards proportion, finish, and the filling\r\n      of space; if his forms are not so noble, and the expression\r\n      of religious sentiment not so deep as in Pietro; yet, on the\r\n      other hand, Pinturicchio is, to my mind, less conscious, more\r\n      fresh and racy than Perugino, and does not so often fatigue us\r\n      by monotony and that conventional sweetness which, especially\r\n      in the productions of his last twenty years, makes Pietro\r\n      positively wearisome. And, as an imaginative landscape-painter,\r\n      Pinturicchio surpasses almost all of his contemporaries\"\r\n      (_German Galleries_, p. 285). Pinturicchio's frescoes at Siena\r\n      occupied him from 1502 to 1509. He probably studied first under\r\n      Fiorenzo di Lorenzo (No. 1103); afterwards he entered into\r\n      partnership with Pietro Perugino. He went to Rome in 1479 and\r\n      was honoured by commissions from cardinals and popes. Among\r\n      his works in Rome are frescoes representing the stories of\r\n      the Virgin and St. Jerome in S. Maria del Popolo; frescoes in\r\n      the Appartamenti Borgia in the Vatican, and frescoes of S.\r\n      Bernardino of Siena in the Bufalini Chapel, S. Maria Aracoeli.\r\n      Morelli attributes to him also two of the frescoes in the\r\n      Sixtine Chapel (the Baptism of Christ and the History of\r\n      Moses). In 1500 he commenced the beautiful series of frescoes,\r\n      now much disfigured, in the collegiate church at Spello (see\r\n      Arundel Society's copies). That he was held in high esteem by\r\n      his fellow-citizens is shown by his having been elected in\r\n      1501 Decemvir of Perugia in place of Pietro Perugino. Unlike\r\n      Perugino, he never mastered the use of oil, but painted in\r\n      tempera. Vasari, who did not like Pinturicchio, describes him\r\n      as somewhat of a hack, and still more of a lover of money.\r\n      \"Among other qualities he possessed that of giving considerable\r\n      satisfaction to princes and nobles because he quickly brought\r\n      the works commanded by them to an end.\" As for his love of\r\n      money, he died of vexation, Vasari assures us, \"because a\r\n      certain trunk which he had insisted on being removed from his\r\n      painting-room in Siena was afterwards found to be full of gold\r\n      pieces.\" According, however, to a contemporary writer, his wife\r\n      left him alone in his house when ill, and he was starved to\r\n      death.\r\n\r\nSt. Catherine of Alexandria was of all the female saints next to\r\nMary Magdalene the most popular: she meets us in nearly every room\r\nin the National Gallery, and even in London, churches and districts\r\nonce placed under her protection still retain her name. Her general\r\nattributes are a book, a sword, and a wheel. The meaning of these\r\nwill be seen from the legend of her which crusaders brought from the\r\nEast. She was the daughter of a queen, and of marvellous wisdom and\r\nunderstanding. And when the time came that she should govern her\r\npeople, she, shunning responsibility and preferring wisdom before\r\nsovereignty, shut herself up in her palace and gave her mind to\r\nthe study of philosophy. For this wilful seclusiveness her people\r\nwished her to marry a husband who should at once fulfil the duties of\r\ngovernment and lead them forth to battle. But she, to prevent this\r\nrepugnant union, made one more spiritual by her mystical marriage with\r\nChrist. And for this and other unworldly persistencies, the heathen\r\ntyrant Maximin would have broken her on a wheel, but that \"fire came\r\ndown from heaven, sent by the destroying angel of God, and broke the\r\nwheel in pieces.\" Yet for all this the tyrant repented not, and after\r\nscourging St. Catherine with rods beheaded her with the sword, and so\r\nhaving won the martyr's palm, she entered into the joy of her Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n694. ST. JEROME IN HIS STUDY.\r\n\r\n  _School of Giovanni Bellini._[168] _See under 189._\r\n\r\nBesides translating the Bible, St. Jerome (see 227) is famous as one of\r\nthe founders of the monastic system, \"of the ordered cell and tended\r\ngarden where before was but the desert and the wild wood,\" and he\r\ndied in the monastery he had founded at Bethlehem. This picture shows\r\nus the inside of monastic life. St. Jerome, with the scholar's look\r\nof quiet satisfaction, is deep in study; his room has no luxury, but\r\nis beautiful in its grace and order; the lion, who seems here to be\r\nsharing his master's meditation, and the partridge peering into the\r\nsaint's slippers, speak of the love of the old monks for the lower\r\nanimals; and the beautiful landscape seen through the open window\r\nrecalls the sweet nooks which they everywhere chose and tended for\r\ntheir dwelling. The effect of the whole picture is to suggest the\r\npeaceful simplicity of the old religious life in contrast to the\r\n\"getting and spending\" with which we now \"lay waste our powers.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture belongs to what Ruskin has called the \"Time of the\r\nMasters,\" who desire only to make everything dainty and delightful.\r\n\"Everything in it is exquisite, complete, and pure; there is not a\r\nparticle of dust in the cupboards, nor a cloud in the air; the wooden\r\nshutters are dainty, the candlestick is dainty, the saint's blue hat\r\nis dainty, and its violet tassel, and its ribbon, and his blue cloak,\r\nand his spare pair of shoes, and his little brown partridge--it is all\r\na perfect quintessence of innocent luxury--absolute delight, without\r\none drawback in it, nor taint of the Devil anywhere\" (_Verona and other\r\nLectures_, § 26). For another specimen of this \"pictorial perfectness\r\nand deliciousness,\" see 288 (especially the compartment with Raphael\r\nand Tobit).\r\n\r\nAs for the partridge, this is frequently introduced into sacred\r\npictures, especially those of the Venetian School. There is a pretty\r\nlegend of St. John which perhaps accounts for it, and which makes\r\nits introduction very appropriate in the picture of a recluse. St.\r\nJohn had, it is said, a tame partridge, which he cherished much, and\r\namused himself with feeding and tending. A certain huntsman, passing\r\nby with his bow and arrows, was astonished to see the great apostle,\r\nso venerable for his age and sanctity, engaged in such an amusement.\r\nThe apostle asked him if he always kept his bow bent. He answered that\r\nwould be the way to render it useless. \"If,\" replied St. John, \"you\r\nunbend your bow to prevent its being useless, so do I thus unbend my\r\nmind for the same reason\" (Mrs. Jameson: _Sacred and Legendary Art_, p.\r\n100).\r\n\r\n\r\n695. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Previtali_ (Bergamese: about 1480-1528).\r\n\r\n      This painter (whose personality is in some art-histories merged\r\n      in that of Cordelle Agii, see 1409) was one of Bellini's\r\n      numerous pupils--a provincial from Bergamo, \"a dry, honest,\r\n      monotonous\" painter (see Morelli's _German Galleries_, pp.\r\n      178-181, and under 1203). \"As regards technique, Previtali\r\n      is certainly very eminent; in brilliance of colouring he is\r\n      not behind any of Bellini's pupils, and the landscapes in\r\n      the background of his pictures are for the most part neatly\r\n      and faultlessly executed. But he lacks the main attributes\r\n      of a great artist--invention and the power of original\r\n      representation.\" Whilst painting in Venice, he signed his\r\n      pictures _Andreas Bergomensis_; on his return to Bergamo,\r\n      _Andreas Previtalus_. His pictures at Bergamo are numerous; the\r\n      best is the altar-piece in S. Spirito.\r\n\r\nA characteristic example of the painter. The figure of the monk in\r\nadoration is somewhat hard. The landscape background is pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n696. MARCO BARBARIGO.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish: 15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nHe was Venetian Consul in London in 1449, and holds in his hand a\r\nletter addressed to him there. He was subsequently elected Doge, but\r\ndied (in 1486), after holding the office for six months. It is recorded\r\nof him as Doge that he was a specially mild-tempered and good man--a\r\ncharacter which is not belied in this portrait of him in his earlier\r\ndays. This portrait was formerly ascribed to Gerard van der Meire (see\r\nunder 1078). It is now by some attributed to Petrus Cristus.\r\n\r\n\r\n697. PORTRAIT OF A TAILOR.\r\n\r\n  _Moroni_ (Bergamese: 1525-1578).\r\n\r\n      Giambattista Moroni is one of the greatest of the Italian\r\n      portrait-painters, and this picture is perhaps his best-known\r\n      and most popular production.[169] The works of Moroni appeal\r\n      alike to the general public and to the painter. He gave to\r\n      his figures a vitality and ease, and impressed upon them a\r\n      verisimilitude which appeal to every spectator. His works (adds\r\n      Sir F. Burton) \"will always be highly estimated by the painter,\r\n      as they exhibit rare technical merits, perfect knowledge and\r\n      command of means, facility of execution without display of\r\n      dexterity, truth of colour, and the finest perception of the\r\n      value of tones.\" \"No portrait-painter ever placed the epidermis\r\n      of the human face upon canvas with more fidelity, and with\r\n      greater truth than Moroni: his portraits have all a more or\r\n      less prosaic look, but they must all have had that startling\r\n      likeness to the original which so enchants the great public,\r\n      who exclaim 'The very man! just how he looks!' And it was\r\n      with the eyes of the great public that Moroni did look at his\r\n      subjects; he was not a poet in the true sense of the word,\r\n      but a consummate painter. Yet, now and then, he manages to\r\n      go beyond himself, and to pierce the surface till he reaches\r\n      the soul of the sitter. In such cases his portraits may rank\r\n      with those of Titian\" (Morelli's _German Galleries_, p. 48).\r\n      His colouring varied at different periods of his life. For\r\n      examples of his manner before he came under Il Moretto's\r\n      influence see 1023 and 1316--the reddish hue of his flesh-tints\r\n      being characteristic. In his second period he adopted the\r\n      \"silvery\" manner of Il Moretto: seen here and in 1022; whilst\r\n      for his third, or naturalistic manner see 742. Moroni is a\r\n      distinguished ornament of the school of Bergamo--a provincial\r\n      school characterised, says Morelli, by \"manly energy,\" but\r\n      also by \"a certain prosaic want of refinement.\" See, for\r\n      other Bergamese painters, Previtali (695) and Cariani (1203).\r\n      Palma Vecchio, the greatest of them, is represented by the\r\n      \"Portrait of Ariosto,\" 636. Giambattista Moroni was a painter\r\n      without honour in his own country, and when people from Bergamo\r\n      came to Titian to be painted, he used to refer them to their\r\n      own countryman--no better face painter, he would tell them,\r\n      existed. Moroni is believed to have entered the studio of\r\n      Moretto at Brescia when fifteen years of age. His religious\r\n      pictures are inferior reflections of his master's. Upon one\r\n      of them, still preserved in the church of Gorlago (between\r\n      Bergamo and Brescia) he was engaged at the time of his death.\r\n      No admirer of Moroni should omit to visit Bergamo: a splendid\r\n      series of his portraits is to be seen in the Carrara gallery\r\n      of that town. There too, as also in the gallery at Verona, is\r\n      a pretty portrait by him of a little girl.\r\n\r\nA \"speaking portrait.\" \"The tailor's picture is so well done,\" says an\r\nold Italian critic, \"that it speaks better than an advocate could.\" A\r\nportrait that enables one, moreover, to realise what was once meant\r\nby a \"worshipful company of merchant tailors.\" Tagliapanni--for such\r\nis his name--is no Alton Locke--- no discontented \"tailor and poet\";\r\nneither is he like some fashionable West-End tailor, with ambitions of\r\nrising above his work. He is well-to-do--notice his handsome ring; but\r\nhe has the shears in his hands. He does the work himself, and he likes\r\nthe work. He is something of an artist, it would seem, in clothes: his\r\njacket and handsome breeches were a piece of his work, one may suppose;\r\nand the artist has caught and immortalised him, as he is standing back\r\nfor a minute to calculate the effect of his next cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n698. THE DEATH OF PROCRIS.\r\n\r\n  _Piero di Cosimo_ (Florentine: 1462-1521).\r\n\r\n      A very characteristic work, and the most interesting of those\r\n      extant, by Piero, called di Cosimo, after his godfather and\r\n      master, Cosimo Rosselli. Piero's peculiarities are well known\r\n      to all readers of George Eliot's _Romola_, where everything\r\n      told us about him by Vasari in one of his most amusing chapters\r\n      is carefully worked up. The first impression left by this\r\n      picture--its quaintness--is precisely typical of the man. He\r\n      shut himself off from the world and stopped his ears; lived in\r\n      the untidiest of rooms, and would not have his garden tended,\r\n      \"preferring to see all things wild and savage about him.\" He\r\n      took his meals at times and in ways that no other man did, and\r\n      Romola used to coax him with sweets and hard-boiled eggs. His\r\n      fondness for quaint landscape (\"he would sometimes stand beside\r\n      a wall,\" says Vasari, \"and image forth the most extraordinary\r\n      landscapes that ever were\") may be seen in this picture; so\r\n      also may his love of animals, in which, says Vasari, he took\r\n      \"indescribable pleasure.\" Piero accompanied his master, Cosimo\r\n      Rosselli, to Rome in 1480, and painted the landscape to that\r\n      master's \"Sermon on the Mount\" in the Sixtine Chapel. He\r\n      painted several altar-pieces, but his true bent was towards\r\n      mythological subjects and quaintly decorative treatment.\r\n      Vasari describes in detail a Carnival triumph devised by Piero.\r\n      This and the adornment of dwelling-rooms and marriage-chests\r\n      were the forms in which his fantastic originality found the\r\n      most congenial expression. He was also a good portrait-painter:\r\n      No. 895 in this gallery has recently been recognised as his\r\n      work.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of Piero's pictures were generally mythological. In\r\n_Romola_ he paints Tito and Romola as Bacchus and Ariadne; here he\r\nshows the death of Procris, the story in which the ancients embodied\r\nthe folly of jealousy. For Procris being told that Cephalus was\r\nunfaithful, straightway believed the report and secretly followed him\r\nto the woods, for he was a great hunter. And Cephalus called upon\r\n\"aura,\" the Latin for breeze, for Cephalus was hot after the chase:\r\n\"Sweet air, O come,\" and echo answered, \"Come, sweet air.\" But Procris,\r\nthinking that he was calling after his mistress, turned to see, and as\r\nshe moved she made a rustling in the leaves, which Cephalus mistook for\r\nthe motion of some beast of the forest, and let fly his unerring dart,\r\nwhich Procris once had given him.\r\n\r\n      But Procris lay among the white wind-flowers,\r\n      Shot in the throat. From out the little wound\r\n      The slow blood drained, as drops in autumn showers\r\n      Drip from the leaves upon the sodden ground.\r\n      None saw her die but Lelaps, the swift hound,\r\n      That watched her dumbly with a wistful fear,\r\n      Till at the dawn, the hornèd wood-men found\r\n      And bore her gently on a sylvan bier,\r\n    To lie beside the sea,--with many an uncouth tear.\r\n\r\nPiero's treatment of the theme is, it should be noted, romantic, rather\r\nthan classical; in which respect his picture is characteristic of\r\nthe earlier Renaissance. \"In creating his Satyr the painter has not\r\nhad recourse to any antique bas-relief, but has imagined for himself\r\na being half human, half bestial, and yet wholly real; nor has he\r\nportrayed in Procris a nymph of Greek form, but a girl of Florence.\r\nThe strange animals and gaudy flowers introduced into the landscape\r\nbackground further remove the subject from the sphere of classic\r\ntreatment. Florentine realism and quaint fancy being thus curiously\r\nblended, the artistic result may be profitably studied for the light it\r\nthrows upon the so-called Paganism of the earlier Renaissance. Fancy at\r\nthat moment was more free than when superior knowledge of antiquity\r\nhad created a demand for reproductive art, and when the painters\r\nthought less of the meaning of the fable for themselves than of its\r\ncapability of being used as a machine for the display of erudition\"\r\n(Symonds's _Renaissance_, iii. 187). Piero seems to have taken his\r\nbackground from Lake Thrasymene.\r\n\r\nPiero's poetic fancy in this picture has aroused a responsive echo in\r\nthe poets of our own day. The lines quoted above are from \"The Death of\r\nProcris; a version suggested by the so-named picture of Piero di Cosimo\r\nin the National Gallery,\" in Mr. Austin Dobson's _Old World Idylls_.\r\nAnother version of the picture may be found in Michael Field's _Sight\r\nand Song_:--\r\n\r\n    And there she lies half-veiled, half-bare,\r\n    Deep in the midst of nature that abides\r\n    Inapprehensive she is lying there,\r\n        So wan;\r\n    The flowers, the silver estuary afar--\r\n    These daisies, plantains, all the white and red\r\n    Field-blossoms through the leaves and grasses spread;\r\n    The water with its pelican,\r\n    Its flight of sails and its blue countrysides--\r\n    Unto themselves they are;\r\n        The dogs sport on the sand,\r\n    The herons curve about the reeds\r\n    Or one by one descend the air,\r\n        While lifelessly she bleeds\r\n        From throat and dabbled hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruskin also has written a piece around our picture, which he reads\r\nwith a different eye from \"Michael Field,\"[170] seeing in it not so\r\nmuch the inapprehensiveness of nature as the pathetic fallacy whereby\r\nthe moods of nature are made to sympathise with human joy or sorrow:--\r\n\r\n      \"The next best landscape (to Bellini's 'Peter Martyr') in\r\n      the National Gallery is a Florentine one on the edge of\r\n      transition to the Greek feeling; and in that the distance\r\n      is still beautiful, but misty, not clear; the flowers are\r\n      still beautiful, but, intentionally, of the colour of blood;\r\n      and in the foreground lies the dead body of Procris, which\r\n      disturbs the poor painter greatly; and he has expressed his\r\n      disturbed mind about it in the figure of a poor little brown\r\n      (nearly black) Faun, or perhaps the god Faunus himself, who\r\n      is much puzzled by the death of Procris, and stoops over\r\n      her, thinking it a woful thing to find her pretty body lying\r\n      there breathless, and all spotted with blood on the breast\"\r\n      (_Lectures on Landscape_, § 94).\r\n\r\n\r\n699. AGOSTINO AND NICCOLO DELLA TORRE.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo Lotto_ (Venetian: 1480-1555).\r\n\r\n      To this great painter full justice has scarcely been done by\r\n      writers on art--an omission which in recent years Morelli and\r\n      still more Mr. Berenson, in his elaborate monograph, have\r\n      sought to repair. Lotto led a wandering life, which took him\r\n      much away from Venice; hence his pictures are comparatively\r\n      little known. Again, as Sir F. Burton points out, \"great\r\n      versatility and remarkable impressibility are among the chief\r\n      characteristics of Lotto, who certainly was possessed of genius\r\n      but whose development was oscillating and affected by many\r\n      influences. Only by extremely careful study and comparison can\r\n      his hand be traced throughout in works, which at first sight\r\n      exhibit little or nothing in common. Were none of Lotto's works\r\n      signed or otherwise attested they would certainly bear very\r\n      various attributions, as indeed many of his unsigned pictures\r\n      have done, and as it is likely some do still.\" The portrait,\r\n      for instance, of Andrea Odoni at Hampton Court was for several\r\n      centuries attributed to Correggio, but recent cleaning has\r\n      uncovered Lotto's signature and the date 1527. Of his power as\r\n      a portrait-painter visitors to the National Gallery can form a\r\n      good idea. His works in this sort will bear comparison with the\r\n      best of his contemporaries. They have, says Morelli, \"all that\r\n      refined, inward elegance of feeling which marks the culminating\r\n      point in the last stage of progressive art in Italy, and\r\n      which is principally represented by Leonardo da Vinci, Lotto,\r\n      Andrea del Sarto, and Correggio; whereas the elegance of\r\n      Bronzino in Tuscany, and of Parmigiano in North Italy, is an\r\n      outward affected one, which has nothing to do with the inner\r\n      life of the person represented, and therefore characterises\r\n      the first stage of declining art.\" His sympathetic nature\r\n      enabled him to seize the finer traits of his sitters, and\r\n      they in turn \"look out from his canvasses as if begging for\r\n      the sympathy\" of the spectator. No. 1047 in our Gallery is\r\n      especially characteristic. Lotto's altar-pieces, which were\r\n      numerous, must be studied at Treviso, Recanati, Jesi, Bergamo,\r\n      and Trescorre (frescoes), near the latter place. His pictures\r\n      at different periods (they are for the most part dated) show\r\n      strong resemblances to different painters--to Bellini and the\r\n      Vivarini, to Palma, to Titian, to Giorgione, and to Correggio.\r\n      He was born at Venice, and, according to Vasari, was a disciple\r\n      of John Bellini. Mr. Berenson, on the contrary, maintains\r\n      on internal evidence that Lotto must have belonged to the\r\n      rival school of Alvise Vivarini. Of Palma, he was, according\r\n      to Vasari, the friend and companion. With Titian he was on\r\n      friendly terms, though if we may judge from a letter by Pietro\r\n      Aretino, the attitude of the worldly Titian coterie to the\r\n      gentle Lotto, was not unmixed with some contempt. \"O Lotto,\" he\r\n      writes, \"as goodness good, and as talent talented, Titian from\r\n      Augsburg, in the midst of the high favour everybody is eager to\r\n      show him, greets and embraces you by the token of the letter\r\n      which I received from him two days ago. He says that it would\r\n      double the pleasure that he takes in the emperor's satisfaction\r\n      with the picture he is now painting, if he had your eye and\r\n      your judgment to approve him. And indeed, the painter is\r\n      not mistaken, for your judgment has been formed by age, by\r\n      nature, and by art, with the prompting of that straightforward\r\n      kindliness which pronounces upon the works of others exactly\r\n      as if they were your own. Envy is not in your breast. Rather\r\n      do you delight to see in other artists certain qualities which\r\n      you do not find in your own brush, although it performs those\r\n      miracles which do not come easy to many who yet feel very happy\r\n      over their technical skill. But holding the second place in\r\n      the art of painting is nothing compared to holding the first\r\n      place in the duties of religion, for Heaven will recompense you\r\n      with a glory that passes the praise of this world.--Venice,\r\n      April 1548.\" The resemblance between Lotto and Correggio was\r\n      founded on no personal intercourse or artistic \"influence,\" but\r\n      on similarity of temperament. It is most conspicuous in the\r\n      works of Lotto's \"Bergamask period\" (1518-1526). But whereas\r\n      Correggio's sensitiveness is to impressions of outward joy\r\n      and beauty, Lotto's is attuned rather to states of the human\r\n      soul. Titian's sitters, it has been well said, are as if on\r\n      parade, and his religious pictures tell of the pomp or rapture\r\n      of public services. Lotto's sitters commune rather with their\r\n      own souls, and in his devotional pieces he aims at a personal\r\n      interpretation of religious motives. \"As a colourist,\" says\r\n      Burton, \"Lotto remained throughout a Venetian. His flesh tints\r\n      are true, and various as the age, sex, and temperament of the\r\n      persons depicted.\" All that we know of his life suggests a\r\n      reserved, sensitive, and unworldly nature. Unlike so many of\r\n      his contemporaries, he never sued the favour of the mighty.\r\n      In his account book recently discovered at Loreto he speaks\r\n      again and again of having done excellent work for people who\r\n      remunerated him with pence where if a contract had been made\r\n      they would have had to pay him in pounds. He lodged sometimes\r\n      with friends, sometimes with monks. His life was that of a\r\n      lonely wanderer, very industrious, but laying up no store. In\r\n      1554 he made over himself and all his belongings to the Holy\r\n      House at Loreto, \"being tired of wandering and wishing to end\r\n      his days in that holy place.\" During the last years of his life\r\n      he had almost entirely lost his voice. In one of his wills is\r\n      a reference which shows us the temperament of the man. Among\r\n      his scanty possessions were a number of antique gems. These\r\n      he speaks of lovingly, because they were engraved with mystic\r\n      symbols for the spirit to brood upon (see _Lorenzo Lotto: an\r\n      Essay in Constructive Criticism_, by Bernhard Berenson, 1895;\r\n      and Morelli's _German Galleries_, pp. 31-40; _Roman Galleries_,\r\n      p. 301).\r\n\r\nAgostino was Professor of Medicine in the University of Padua; he\r\nholds a copy of \"Galen,\" the most celebrated of the ancient medical\r\nwriters, in his hand. It was for Niccolo, however, according to the\r\ninscription, that the picture was painted in 1515; and Signor Morelli\r\n(its former owner) thinks that Agostino's portrait must have been\r\ninserted at a later time, for \"it is placed very awkwardly in the\r\nbackground\" (_German Galleries_, p. 37 _n._). \"No one with a feeling\r\nfor composition can doubt for an instant that Agostino was originally\r\nintended to be alone on the canvas, as he occupies all of it that a\r\nsingle bust ought to occupy. Morelli's inference seems thus to be well\r\nfounded that Lotto, on his return from Venice to Bergamo, stopped at\r\nPadua and painted the portrait of Agostino, which he brought to Niccolo\r\nat Bergamo, who thereupon had his own portrait added.... Lotto's\r\nsitters were in no way remarkable. Nevertheless, he gives them a look\r\nof refinement and innate sweetness of nature which brings us very close\r\nto them\" (Berenson, pp. 138, 321).\r\n\r\n\r\n700. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Bernardino Lanini_ (Lombard: about 1508-1578).\r\n\r\n      Lanini was a native of Vercelli, and a scholar of Gaudenzio\r\n      Ferrari. Subsequently he approached more to the manner of\r\n      Leonardo, as in this picture dated 1543. His works are frequent\r\n      at Turin and Vercelli. There is an altar-piece by him at Borgo\r\n      Sesia, near Varallo; his principal works are frescoes in the\r\n      Cathedral at Novara.\r\n\r\nMr. Pater bids us notice in this picture the \"pensive, tarnished silver\r\nsidelights, like mere reflections of natural sunshine\" (\"Art Notes in\r\nNorth Italy,\" _New Review_, Nov. 1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n701. THE CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Justus of Padua_ (died 1400).\r\n\r\n      A picture of interest as being the oldest by any North Italian\r\n      painter in the Gallery--the date inscribed on the plinth below\r\n      is 1367. Justus (Giusto di Giovanni) was a native of Florence,\r\n      who in 1375 settled in Padua and founded his style upon the\r\n      works of Giotto in that town. The frescoes at Padua formerly\r\n      ascribed to him are now said to be the works of his scholars,\r\n      Giovanni and Antonio da Padova.\r\n\r\nNone of the pictures in our Gallery by followers of Giotto is so\r\nsatisfactory as this; \"exquisite both in design and colour, though on\r\na very small scale, it has,\" says Sir E. Poynter, \"all the largeness\r\nof style which characterises the great Florentine fourteenth-century\r\nfrescoes\" (_The National Gallery_, i. 258). \"The Virgin is of a fresh\r\ntype, pretty and noble also. Amongst the saints in the centre picture\r\nthat of St. Paul (on the extreme right) is distinguished by its natural\r\nbearing. There is, however, vigour and a sense of beauty and proportion\r\nthroughout this charming little work.\" In the panel to the left, with\r\nthe Nativity, \"may be noticed the spirit of alertness in the attendant\r\nwaiting to wash the child, and the statuesque design of St. Joseph\";\r\nin that to the right, with the crucifixion, \"the figure of St. John,\r\nat the foot of the Cross, with its fine expression of grief, and\r\nbeautifully-designed drapery\" (Monkhouse, _Italian Pre-Raphaelites_,\r\np. 23). Above is the Annunciation, with regard to which see notes on\r\nNo. 1139. On the reverse side of the wings are other incidents from the\r\nlife of the Virgin.\r\n\r\nThis and the pictures following (701-722) were presented by Queen\r\nVictoria to the National Gallery \"in fulfilment of the wishes of\r\nH.R.H. the Prince Consort.\" They formerly belonged to the collection\r\nof H.I.H. Prince Louis of Oettingen-Wallerstein, and afterwards\r\nbecame the property of Prince Albert. It was his intention from\r\nthe first to present them to the nation, but the gift was delayed\r\nowing to the uncertainty with regard to the site of the proposed new\r\nNational Gallery. The Prince's purpose remained unaccomplished, but\r\nnot forgotten, at his death, and in 1863 the best pictures from the\r\ncollection were presented by Queen Victoria to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n702. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Umbrian: 15th-16th century).\r\n\r\nFormerly ascribed to _L'Ingegno_. _See 1220._\r\n\r\n\r\n703. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Pinturicchio_ (Umbrian: 1454-1513). _See 693._\r\n\r\n\r\n704. COSIMO, DUKE OF TUSCANY.\r\n\r\n  _Angelo Bronzino_ (Florentine: 1502-1572). _See 649._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nA contemporary portrait of the great Medici, the first \"Grand Duke\"\r\nof Tuscany (ruled 1537-1564), who was regarded in his day as the very\r\nincarnation of Machiavelli's _Prince_, \"inasmuch as he joined daring\r\nto talent and prudence,\" and though \"he could practise mercy in due\r\nseason,\" was yet \"capable of great cruelty.\" No one, who notices here\r\nthat large protruding under lip of his, will doubt this last element in\r\nhis character.\r\n\r\n\r\n705. STS. MATTHEW, CATHERINE, AND JOHN.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Stephan Lochner_ (Early German: died 1451).\r\n\r\n      \"Meister Stephan\" was a native of Constance, who settled in\r\n      Cologne, and whose work has the stamp of the early Cologne\r\n      School (see 687). His chief work is the so-called Dombild, now\r\n      in Cologne Cathedral: \"Item. I gave two white pennies,\" says\r\n      Albert Dürer in his diary, \"to see the picture that Master\r\n      Staffan of Cologne painted.\" This famous altar-piece has been\r\n      published by the Arundel Society. \"Italian Art,\" says Sir F.\r\n      Burton, \"has seldom produced a group so beautiful as that of\r\n      the crowned Madonna in its central panel.\" Another exquisite\r\n      little picture ascribed to Meister Stephan is in the Cologne\r\n      Museum.\r\n\r\nThree figures full of innocent fervour and graceful sentimentality.\r\nSt. Matthew as an evangelist holds a book and a pen, and is attended\r\nby the symbolic angel. St. John is attended by the eagle, which is the\r\nconstant symbol of this evangelist, because he soared upwards to the\r\ncontemplation of the divine nature of the Saviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n706. PRESENTATION OF CHRIST IN THE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n  _The Master of the Lyversberg Passion_ (German:\r\n  died about 1490).\r\n\r\n      A picture by the unknown painter of a series of Passion\r\n      pictures, formerly belonging to Herr Lyversberg of Cologne,\r\n      but now in the Museum of the city. He painted also a series\r\n      of eight subjects from the Life of Mary. Of these six are in\r\n      the Pinacothek at Munich, a seventh is in the German Museum at\r\n      Nuremberg, and our picture is the eighth.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic of the German School after the Flemish influence. The\r\nsky background is gilt as in the old German pictures, but the types of\r\nthe figures are Flemish. Notice the quaint pointed shoes, and the touch\r\nof realism in making the foot of Simeon, as he advances to receive the\r\nchild from its mother, come half out of his slipper.\r\n\r\n\r\n707. ST. PETER AND ST. DOROTHY.\r\n\r\n  _Master of the Cologne Crucifixion_ (Early German School: early 16th\r\n    century).\r\n\r\nPart of an altar-piece, the rest of which is in the Munich Gallery, by\r\nan artist whose name is unknown, and who is therefore called after his\r\nprincipal works (now in the Cologne Museum). It has been well said of\r\nhim that \"he succeeded in giving an intense expression of transient\r\nemotion to the faces; but by endeavouring to lend a sympathetic action\r\nto the whole figure, he has exaggerated the action into distortion\"\r\n(_History of Painting_, from the German of Woltmann and Woermann,\r\nii. 224). This is conspicuously the case here. Look, for instance,\r\nat the comic contrast between St. Peter's big foot and St. Dorothy's\r\npointed little shoe--between what is almost a leer on his face and the\r\n\"mincing\" affectation on hers. St. Peter is distinguished of course\r\nby the keys; St. Dorothy by the basket of flowers--the flowers which\r\nshe sent to Theophilus in token of the truth of the faith in which she\r\ndied: \"Carry these to Theophilus, say that Dorothea has sent them,\r\nand that I go before him to the garden whence they came and await him\r\nthere\" (see Mrs. Jameson; _Sacred and Legendary Art_, p. 336, ed.\r\n1850).\r\n\r\n\r\n708. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_[171] (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n\r\nThe Madonna offers Christ an apple--symbol of the forbidden fruit, and\r\nthus of the sin in the world which he came to remove.\r\n\r\n\r\n709. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish School; 15th-16th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\n\"In Flemish pictures the varnish was incorporated with the surface\r\ncolours, and cannot be removed without destroying at the same time\r\nthe very fabric of the work. For this reason all attempts to, what is\r\ncalled, _restore_, or clean pictures of the Flemish School, result only\r\nin the destruction of the work, and by this means many fine pictures\r\nhave, for all practical purposes, perished.... (This picture) is a\r\nlamentable example\" (Conway's _Early Flemish Artists_, p. 119).\r\n\r\n\r\n710. PORTRAIT OF A MONK.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_[172] (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n711. \"MATER DOLOROSA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n712. \"ECCE HOMO!\"\r\n\r\n  _Roger van der Weyden_ (Flemish: 1400-1464). _See 664._\r\n\r\n\"It was a common custom with Roger's followers to copy single heads\r\nout of their master's large groups. Such single heads always have gold\r\nbackgrounds, usually dotted over with little black dashes\" (Conway's\r\n_Early Flemish Artists_, p. 275). These companion panels are perhaps\r\ninstances, and the heads selected for reproduction are typical of the\r\noverstrained pathos of this school. Notice how prominently the tears in\r\nthe sorrowing mother, and the blood and tears in the \"Ecco Homo\" are\r\nmade to stand out.\r\n\r\n\r\n713. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Mostaert_ (Early Dutch: 1474-1555).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\n      Mostaert, a native of Haarlem, was for eighteen years painter\r\n      to Margaret of Austria, Regent of the Netherlands. A picture\r\n      ascribed to him is preserved in the church of Notre Dame at\r\n      Bruges, but no known pictures bear his signature. A large\r\n      number of his works perished in the great fire at Haarlem in\r\n      1571.\r\n\r\nOne of the few specimens in the Gallery of the first period of Dutch\r\nart, when it was still following the traditions of the Early Flemish\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\n\r\n714. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelis Engelbertsz_ (Dutch: 1468-1533).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\n      Engelbertsz was one of the earliest oil painters at Leyden,\r\n      and is said to have been the master of Lucas of Leyden. Most\r\n      of his important religious works were destroyed by the Dutch\r\n      iconoclasts of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n715. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _Joachim Patinir_ (Early Flemish: died 1524).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\n      Patinir (born at Dinant, but settled in Antwerp) was styled\r\n      by Albert Dürer, who stayed with him when in Antwerp, drew\r\n      his portrait and attended his wedding, \"Joachim the good\r\n      landscape painter.\" What distinguishes his landscape is its\r\n      greater expanse, as compared with earlier works. The Flemish\r\n      painters preceding him were mostly content with the narrow\r\n      domestic scenery of their own Maas country. But Patinir's\r\n      pictures \"embrace miles of country, and open on every side....\r\n      Some far-away cottage by the river-side, some hamlet nestling\r\n      against a remote hill-slope, some castle on a craggy peak,\r\n      blue against the transparent sky--such objects were a joy to\r\n      him.... Moreover, with Patinir the fantastic element was of\r\n      much importance. He wished his landscapes to be romantic.... He\r\n      would have precipitous rocks.... His river must pass through\r\n      gorges or under natural archways; his skies must be full of\r\n      moving clouds; his wide districts of country must present\r\n      contrasts of rocky mountain, water, and fertile plains.... He\r\n      saw also the grandeur of wild scenery, and strove, though not\r\n      with perfect success, to bring that into his pictures, showing\r\n      thereby the possession of a foretaste of that delight in nature\r\n      for her own sake, the full enjoyment of which has been reserved\r\n      for the people of our own century\" (Conway's _Early Flemish\r\n      Artists_, pp. 299, 300). \"His figures,\" says Sir F. Burton,\r\n      \"while retaining old Netherlandish characteristics, are\r\n      good, expressive, and even noble in conception.\" Most of the\r\n      Galleries contain pictures by Patinir. Madrid is particularly\r\n      rich in them.\r\n\r\n\"A high authority on early Flemish art, M. Henri Hymans, has stated\r\nthat the figures in the 'Crucifixion' given to Joachim Patinir, and of\r\nwhich the landscape is undoubtedly his, are by the painter's friend,\r\nQuentin Matsys. Unquestionably these figures differ much in colour and\r\nexecution from those contained in such other examples of Patinir in the\r\nNational Gallery as the 'Nun' (945), or 'The Visit of the Virgin to St.\r\nElizabeth' (1082)\" (Claude Phillips in the _Academy_, September 28,\r\n1889).\r\n\r\n\r\n716. ST. CHRISTOPHER.\r\n\r\n  _Joachim Patinir_ (Early Flemish: died 1524). _See 715._\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest attempts in painting to tell the beautiful legend\r\nof Christopher (the Christ bearer), the hermit ferryman, who, \"having\r\nsustained others in their chief earthly trials, afterwards had Christ\r\nfor companion of his own.\" The best account of the legend of St.\r\nChristopher is to be found in Miss Alexander's _Roadside Songs of\r\nTuscany_, edited by Ruskin, illustrated with \"the most beautiful and\r\ntrue designs that have ever yet been made out of all the multitude by\r\nwhich alike the best spiritual and worldly power of Art have commended\r\nto Christendom its noblest monastic legend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n717. ST. JOHN ON THE ISLAND OF PATMOS.\r\n\r\n  _Joachim Patinir_ (Early Flemish: died 1524). _See 715._\r\n\r\nThe evangelist on the island of Patmos, writing the revelations out\r\nof an ink-horn held by an eagle, which an imp is attempting to steal.\r\nIn the sky above are the revelations themselves: \"And there appeared\r\na great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon\r\nunder her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.... And there\r\nappeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon,\r\nhaving seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads\"\r\n(Revelation xii. 1, 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n718. CHRIST ON THE CROSS.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Hendrik Bles_ (Flemish: about 1480-1550).\r\n\r\n      Bles, called by the Italians \"Civetta\" (the owl), on account of\r\n      the owl which he often adopted as his monogram, was an imitator\r\n      of Patinir (see 715). Van Mander says that his nickname was Met\r\n      de Bles (with the forelock), but as he signs himself Henricus\r\n      Blessius, it is probable that Bles was his real name.\r\n\r\n\r\n719. THE READING MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Hendrik Bles_ (_See last picture_).\r\n\r\nFor the subject see No. 654.\r\n\r\n\r\n720. A \"REPOSE\" (see No. 160).\r\n\r\n\r\n721. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Schorel_ (Dutch: 1495-1562).\r\n\r\n      Schorel, so called from his birthplace, belongs to the second\r\n      period of Dutch art, and was one of the most successful of the\r\n      \"Italianisers\"; but neither of these pictures is a good or\r\n      indeed a certain specimen. He was a poet and musician as well\r\n      as a painter, and studied under Albert Dürer at Nuremberg.\r\n      He afterwards visited Venice, whence he went to Jerusalem,\r\n      returning by Rhodes to Rome. In 1522 he was made by his\r\n      countryman, Pope Adrian VI., Keeper of the Art Collection of\r\n      the Vatican. He afterwards returned to Utrecht, where he died\r\n      a Canon of St. Mary's. He was the master of Anthony Mor.\r\n\r\n\r\n722. A LADY'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (German: 15th-16th century).\r\n\r\nFormerly ascribed to Sigmund Holbein (1465-1540). A German\r\nhousewife--with a characteristic mixture about her of sentimentality\r\n(for she holds a forget-me-not in her hand) and of austerity (for there\r\nis something forbidding, surely, in these terribly angular fingers of\r\nhers).\r\n\r\n\r\n724. \"OUR LADY OF THE SWALLOW.\"\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Crivelli_ (Venetian: painted 1468-1493). _See 602._\r\n\r\nFull of the dainty detail which characterises the Venetian pictures\r\nof this time. Notice the fruit placed everywhere about the Virgin's\r\nthrone; and above, the vases of flowers and the swallow--hence the name\r\nof the picture, \"Madonna della Rondine.\" Notice also the beautiful\r\ndress patterns and the rich hanging brocades. The Virgin's dress is\r\na lovely silk brocade, of a design which might well be copied for\r\nmuslins and curtains. In this picture, however, \"Crivelli's gift\r\nof characterisation has been overpowered by his interest in the\r\naccessories. St. Jerome, indeed, is a noble and dignified figure, but\r\nwho could believe in the St. Sebastian? As a study of costume the\r\nfigure is interesting, reproducing every detail with minute fidelity,\r\nand bringing before us the model of a well-dressed young man of\r\nCrivelli's time. But the features are of an ignoble type, and the\r\nattitude is suggestive only of self-conscious vanity. Instead of a\r\ndevout attendant at the throne, we seem to get a dandy posing for the\r\nadmiration of the spectator.\" The scenes of the predella, on the other\r\nhand, are full of animation, of feeling, and of force (Rushforth's\r\n_Crivelli_, p. 72). The picture is signed by Carolus Crivellus _Miles_,\r\nso that it is one of his later works. In the centre of the step is the\r\nescutcheon of the Odoni family, for whose chapel in the church of the\r\nFranciscans at Matelica the picture was painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n726. CHRIST'S AGONY IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_ (Venetian: 1426-1516). _See 189._\r\n\r\nAn early work of the master, painted probably about 1459 (nearly half\r\na century earlier than the Doge's portrait, 189), but interesting as\r\nshowing the advance made by him in landscape. \"We see for the first\r\ntime an attempt to render a particular effect of light, the first\r\ntwilight picture with clouds rosy with the lingering gleams of sunset,\r\nand light shining from the sky on hill and town--the first in which\r\na head is seen in shadow against a brilliant sky\" (Monkhouse: _The\r\nItalian Pre-Raphaelites_, p. 73). \"In the figures of the Apostles,\r\nespecially in the one on the left, the repose of sleep is expressed in\r\nso admirable and convincing a manner, that it would be difficult to\r\nname a second painter of the _quattro-cento_ who could compare with\r\nBellini in this respect\" (Richter). Nor is the advance one in the\r\ntechnique of art only. The picture is one of the earliest in which art\r\nmade use of what Ruskin calls \"the pathetic fallacy\"--in which, that\r\nis, art represents nature as sympathising with human emotion. Bellini\r\n\"called in nature,\" says Mr. Hodgson, R.A. (_Magazine of Art_, 1886,\r\np 215), \"to sympathise with human sorrows, or rather he was the first\r\nto point out that nature takes her colouring and her aspects from\r\nthe conditions of our passions and sentiments.[173] That sombre sky,\r\nwith its gleam along the horizon, that long dark hill, the wild plain\r\nover which the traitor and his accomplices are stealing, have exactly\r\nthe aspect which they would present to one who stood there knowing\r\nthat a horrible treason was going to be perpetrated.\" Compare, for\r\nthis \"pathetic fallacy\" in painting, Titian's \"Noli me tangere\" (No.\r\n270). Bellini's picture should be compared with Mantegna's of the same\r\nsubject in an adjoining room (1417). Mantegna seizes only the sublimity\r\nof the idea of the Agony, Bellini's penetrating sympathy renders its\r\ninfinite pathos. Mantegna's picture is in some technical respects the\r\nmore accomplished; \"but in all that concerns the imaginative conception\r\nof the subject, in the harmonising of all the accessories to produce a\r\nsingle profound impression on the emotions, above all in the large and\r\nreposeful spaciousness of the composition, Bellini is surely the more\r\nto be admired\" (Roger Fry: _Giovanni Bellini_, p. 22). Both pictures\r\nmay be profitably compared with Correggio's of the same subject, in\r\nwhich we are introduced to a new order of ideas (See notes on No. 76).\r\n\r\n\r\n727. THE TRINITY.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Pesellino_ (Florentine: 1422-1457).\r\n\r\n      This accomplished master was called Pesellino to distinguish\r\n      him from his grandfather Pesello, by whom he was brought up. He\r\n      is \"entitled to one of the highest places in the ranks of the\r\n      Florentine School of the fifteenth century. His compositions\r\n      are distinguished by their lively grace, and the beautiful\r\n      and truthful expressions of the persons portrayed\" (Kugler).\r\n      In beauty of colour and dignity of design the work before us\r\n      is his masterpiece. He was a pupil of Fra Filippo Lippi, and\r\n      subsequently opened a workshop in Florence in partnership\r\n      with a certain Piero di Lorenzo. He died at the early age of\r\n      thirty-five, leaving a widow and several children in penury.\r\n      His works are very rare. Two compartments of a predella by\r\n      him are in the Accademia at Florence, a fourth being in the\r\n      Louvre. The collection of Morelli (now in the Public Gallery of\r\n      Bergamo) contains three charming little pictures by him, which\r\n      strongly recall the style of Fra Filippo (Morelli's account of\r\n      the painter is in his _Roman Galleries_, pp. 253-58). \"In the\r\n      Torrigiani Palace at Florence are two remarkable panels from\r\n      _cassoni_, there ascribed to Gozzoli, but by modern criticism\r\n      more justly to Pesellino; they bear out Vasari's remark as to\r\n      this painter's skill in delineating animals\" (Burton).\r\n\r\nThis picture is perhaps the finest version extant of the conventional\r\nItalian representation of the mystery of the Trinity. The Son on a\r\ncrucifix is supported by the Father, whilst the Holy Spirit in the\r\nform of a dove hovers over the head of the Son. The head of the First\r\nPerson of the Trinity is a very majestic conception. \"In this face,\r\nso full of beauty and power, of intensity and calm, as well as the\r\ncareful modelling of the pathetic figure of Christ upon the cross,\r\nPesellino touches heights which Lippi could not reach; but in the\r\ncharming cherubim and seraphim with which the severity of the subject\r\nis softened and decorated, and in the beauty of the colour (though\r\nthat has suffered much) we may recognise the influence of his master.\r\nWe have only to compare this picture with the representations of\r\nthe same subject by Landini (580_a_) and Orcagna (570) to show how\r\nthe power to render the most august subjects had been increased by\r\nprogress in technical accomplishment and the liberation of the artist's\r\nimagination, even when the elements and arrangements of the composition\r\nremained virtually unchanged from the traditional type\" (Monkhouse, _In\r\nthe National Gallery_, p. 62). The picture is referred to by Vasari:\r\n\"At Pistoja is a work by Pesello, representing the Trinity, with\r\nfigures of San Zeno and San Jacopo\" (ii. 115). On the suppression of\r\nthe religious congregation to whom the church of the Holy Trinity at\r\nPistoja belonged, the picture was sold, and passed into the collection\r\nof Mr. Young Ottley. The side panels referred to by Vasari are still in\r\nprivate collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n728. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Beltraffio_ (Lombard: 1467-1516).\r\n\r\n      Giovanni Antonio Beltraffio came of a noble family in Milan\r\n      (his epitaph is in the Brera) and filled public offices in\r\n      his native town. He fell under the influence of Leonardo, and\r\n      when that master settled at Milan, Beltraffio lodged in his\r\n      house, and became his ardent disciple. \"His most ambitious\r\n      creation, where he lamentably fails, is the Louvre altar-piece,\r\n      the redeeming features of which are the fine portraits of the\r\n      Casio family, his friends and patrons. When he confined himself\r\n      to portraiture he was often strikingly successful, and the\r\n      older Milanese families still possess a number of ancestral\r\n      portraits by him, some of which are of great charm. He seems\r\n      to have become the pet artist of the society of his day,\r\n      often painting the portraits of his friends in the guise of\r\n      a St. Sebastian, or as Sta. Barbara. He accompanied Leonardo\r\n      to Rome in 1514. Although not a great artist, and entirely\r\n      lacking in imagination and dramatic power, he exhibits singular\r\n      refinement. His cultured intellect enabled him to appreciate,\r\n      and in a measure reflect, the fastidious spirit of his master.\r\n      His works charm by their high finish, and by the absence of\r\n      all vulgarity or display. His portraits do not reveal much\r\n      penetration, and he never caught the subtleties of character or\r\n      the intellectual qualities of his sitters\" (_Catalogue of the\r\n      Burlington Fine Arts Club Exhibition_, 1898, p. lviii.). His\r\n      pictures are for the most part on a small scale. Good specimens\r\n      are to be seen in the Morelli collection at Bergamo, and the\r\n      Poldi-Pezzoli collection at Milan. To delineate the human\r\n      figure on a large scale, or human passions, was not his forte;\r\n      he succeeded better in expressing naïve innocence in children,\r\n      and gentle grace in the Mother of God, or devoted women\r\n      (Morelli's _German Galleries_, pp. 425-48; _Roman Galleries_,\r\n      p. 163).\r\n\r\nOf Beltraffio's powers in the respect last mentioned this charming\r\npicture is perhaps the best specimen extant. The child with its quaint\r\nbelly-band, and still more the noble but slightly languishing grace of\r\nthe mother, at once recall Leonardo.\r\n\r\n\r\n729. THE ADORATION OF THE KINGS.\r\n\r\n  _Vincenzo Foppa_ (Lombard: about 1425-1492).\r\n\r\n      Foppa--Il Vecchio as he is called, to distinguish him from a\r\n      younger Foppa of the Brescian School[174]--is an important\r\n      person in the history of art. Born at Brescia, but removing\r\n      in early manhood to Milan, he \"holds both in the School of\r\n      Brescia, and especially in that of Milan, the same place that\r\n      the mighty Mantegna does at Padua, and Cosimo Tura at Ferrara,\"\r\n      representing that early period of development when force of\r\n      character is more insisted on than beauty of expression. In\r\n      relation to the Milanese, Foppa was the founder of the school\r\n      which prevailed before and up to the time of Leonardo da\r\n      Vinci. He was already an artist of repute in 1456, when he was\r\n      employed to decorate the Medici Palace at Milan with frescoes.\r\n      These works, and many others executed by him in Milan and the\r\n      neighbourhood, have perished. His best remaining frescoes are\r\n      those of the Four Fathers of the Church in S. Eustorgio at\r\n      Milan. Foppa was also employed in Genoa and Savona. Late in\r\n      life he returned to Brescia, where he received a renewed grant\r\n      of citizenship, and a pension, and where also he died. Of his\r\n      extant works, the earliest is a Crucifixion in the Bergamo\r\n      gallery. This is dated 1456, and supports the statement of old\r\n      writers that Foppa had studied under Squarcione at Padua. His\r\n      latest work is the altar-piece, now in S. Maria di Castello at\r\n      Savona. This belongs to the year 1490, and agrees in style with\r\n      our National Gallery picture. Foppa is said to have written on\r\n      perspective, and many painters of the Lombard School studied\r\n      under him.\r\n\r\nTraces of the older style of work, from which Foppa freed his school,\r\nmay here be seen in the embossed ornaments in gilt stucco. Notice\r\nthe daintiness of the picture throughout: the pretty flowers in the\r\nforeground, the splendid brocades of the kneeling king, the birds\r\nand weeds in the ruined stable. In the background are the star and\r\ncity of Bethlehem. \"The general effect is dark and heavy, relieved\r\nby an abundant use of red; the flesh tones, as usual, are of ashen\r\nhue. The Madonna is of Foppa's characteristic type, of solid build.\r\nIt is interesting to find that there is little or no direct trace of\r\nLeonardesque influence, a fact which shows that Foppa was too advanced\r\nin years to modify perceptibly his style on the advent of the mighty\r\nFlorentine in 1481\" (_Catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club\r\nExhibition_, 1898, p. xxviii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n732. A CANAL SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Aart van der Neer_ (Dutch: 1603-1677). _See 152._\r\n\r\nThe figures in the picture are supposed to be by Lingelbach (see No.\r\n837).\r\n\r\n\r\n734. A MILANESE LAWYER.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Solario_ (Lombard: about 1460-1520).\r\n\r\n      Andrea belonged to an artist family, the Solari (of Solaro,\r\n      a village near Saronna); one of his brothers, Christopher\r\n      (nicknamed \"Il Gobbo,\" the hunchback), was an architect and\r\n      sculptor, and from him perhaps Andrea learnt his superb\r\n      modelling of the head--a point which is conspicuous in this\r\n      picture, and in which he surpassed all his contemporaries.\r\n      His repute in his own time is attested by the journey he made\r\n      to France in 1507. The Cardinal George of Amboise desired to\r\n      entrust the decoration of a chapel to Leonardo; but Leonardo\r\n      was too much taken up with hydraulic works at Milan to accept\r\n      the commission, and the Cardinal's representative sent Andrea\r\n      in the great man's place. It is not known with whom Solario\r\n      studied painting, but his subject-pictures prove conclusively\r\n      that he came within Leonardo's sphere of influence. \"Although\r\n      by birth and training a Lombard artist, Solario was so much in\r\n      Venice that his native style was largely modified. There is\r\n      no historical evidence that he ever met Antonello da Messina,\r\n      but his works bear such close resemblance to that master's\r\n      productions that it cannot be doubted they were acquainted.\r\n      The portrait No. 923 is obviously Venetian in character;\r\n      indeed, it passed not long since under Bellini's name. It seems\r\n      unnecessary to suppose [with Morelli] that he paid a visit\r\n      to Flanders. The Flemish traits so conspicuous in his work\r\n      could well be derived from contact with Antonello. To the end\r\n      of his life he painted with the utmost finish and delicacy.\r\n      The brilliance and warmth of his colour compensate for the\r\n      somewhat cold ivory pallor of his flesh tones. His landscapes\r\n      are remarkably picturesque and full of incident. That behind\r\n      the figure of Longono in the National Gallery portrait is of\r\n      the greatest delicacy and charm\" (_Catalogue of the Burlington\r\n      Fine Arts Club Exhibition_, 1898, p. lxi. See also Morelli's\r\n      _German Galleries_, pp. 63-68; _Roman Galleries_, pp. 170-176).\r\n      Subject-pictures by Solario may be seen in the Brera and the\r\n      Poldi-Pezzoli Gallery at Milan, and in the Louvre. His last\r\n      work was a large \"Assumption of the Virgin\" for the Certosa of\r\n      Pavia (now in the Sacristy), which his death prevented him from\r\n      finishing.\r\n\r\nA portrait (dated 1505) of the artist's friend, a Milanese lawyer,\r\nwhose name, John Christopher Longono, is written on a letter in his\r\nright hand. He wears the gown and cap (not unlike that still worn\r\nby French \"advocates\") of his profession. Observe the landscape\r\nbackground--here quaintly peopled with prancing dogs and horses on\r\nthe left, and servants in red pushing off boats on the right--with\r\nwhich the old painters, like some of our modern photographers, were\r\nfond of flattering their subjects. But in this case the subject is\r\nwell entitled to his \"setting,\" for he is a nobleman as well as a\r\nlawyer, and the background is perhaps studied from his country seat.\r\nOn the bottom of the panel is a Latin inscription which, literally\r\ninterpreted, runs, \"Not knowing what you have been or what you may be,\r\nmay it for long be your study to be able to see what you are,\" _i.e._\r\nby looking at this picture of yourself--a neatly-turned compliment at\r\nonce to the painter and his subject: the picture is to last for many\r\na long year, and the lawyer for many a long year is to grow no older.\r\nOr is the inscription also meant to describe the lawyer's character in\r\nwords, as the portrait does in colours--a man not troubled overmuch\r\nwith what has been or what may be hereafter, but one who is keenly\r\nalive to what he is, and who pours all his powers into the tasks and\r\ninterests of the present?\r\n\r\n\r\n735. ST. ROCH WITH THE ANGEL.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Morando_ (Veronese: 1486-1522).\r\n\r\n      Paolo Morando, otherwise known as Cavazzola (his father was\r\n      Taddeo Cavazzola di Jacobi di Morando), was a pupil of Morone\r\n      (see 285). He \"infused a higher life, and a fine system of\r\n      colouring into the Veronese School, making thus a great advance\r\n      upon his contemporaries, and preparing the way for Paul\r\n      Veronese.... He shows, as Dr. Burckhardt has justly observed,\r\n      'a marvellous transition from the realism of the fifteenth\r\n      century to the noble free character of the sixteenth, not to an\r\n      empty idealism'\" (_Layard_, i. 270). His masterpieces are still\r\n      in his native Verona, and nowhere else, except in the National\r\n      Gallery, can he be studied.\r\n\r\nSt. Roch is the patron of the sick and plague-stricken. The legend\r\nsays that he left great riches to travel as a pilgrim to Rome, where\r\nhe tended those sick of the plague, and by his intercession effected\r\nmiraculous cures. Through many cities he laboured thus, until at last\r\nin Piacenza he became himself plague-stricken, and with a horrible\r\nulcer in his thigh he was turned out into a lonely wood. He has here\r\nlaid aside his pilgrim staff and hung his hat upon it, and prepared\r\nhimself to die, when an angel appears to him and drops a fresh rose on\r\nhis path. There is no rose without a thorn, and no thorn in a saint's\r\ncrown without a rose. He bares his thigh to show his wound to the\r\nangel, who (says the legend) dressed it for him, whilst his little dog\r\nmiraculously brought him every morning a loaf of bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n736. A VENETIAN SENATOR.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Bonsignori_ (Veronese: 1455-1519).\r\n\r\n      Called incorrectly, by Vasari, Monsignori. He was born at\r\n      Verona, where, in the churches of S. Fermo, S. Bernardino, S.\r\n      Paolo, and in the Pinacoteca, works by him may be seen. In\r\n      the grand but not always attractive productions of his earlier\r\n      style, Bonsignori followed the traditions and manner of the\r\n      Veronese School. Later in life he went to Mantua, where he\r\n      settled and was influenced by Mantegna (see Morelli's _German\r\n      Galleries_, p. 103, _note_).\r\n\r\nA portrait--remarkable for vigorous execution, and strong\r\nindividuality--of a senator, from the life, \"in his habit as he\r\nstood,\"--a branch of art in which this painter excelled. He has been\r\ncalled indeed \"the modern Zeuxis,\" after the famous Greek painter whose\r\npainted grapes deceived the birds. For so lifelike were Bonsignori's\r\npictures--says Vasari in his entertaining account of this painter--that\r\non one occasion a dog rushed at a painted dog on the artist's canvas,\r\nwhilst on another a bird flew forward to perch itself on the extended\r\narm of a painted child. The portrait before us is executed in tempera.\r\nThe study in chalk, for it is in the Albertina collection at Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n737. A WATERFALL.\r\n\r\n  _Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1628-1682). _See 627._\r\n\r\n\r\n739. THE ANNUNCIATION.\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Crivelli_ (Venetian: painted 1468-1493). _See 602._\r\n\r\nMary is kneeling in her chamber; while a golden ray from a glory above,\r\npiercing the house wall, has struck her head, over which is hovering a\r\ndove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit. The angel of the Annunciation is\r\noutside in the court, but she cannot see him, for a wall stands between\r\nthem--\"a treatment of the subject which may be intended to suggest\r\nthat the angel appeared to her in a dream.\" It also gives the painter\r\nan opportunity for introducing an additional display of incident and\r\nornament. Beside the angel is St. Emidius, the patron saint of Ascoli,\r\nwith a model of the city in his hand. \"There could not be better\r\nexamples of what we may call Crivelli's 'exquisite' style, which is\r\nonly just saved by its refinement from mere prettiness and affectation.\r\nThis angel is a _poseur_ if ever there was one.\" The picture is very\r\ncharacteristic, in two features, of mediæval art. First, it was never\r\nantiquarian: it did not attempt to give a correct historical setting\r\n(_cf._ under 294). No mediæval painter made the Virgin a Jewess; they\r\nnationalised her, as it were, and painted her in the likeness of their\r\nown maidens. So too their scenery was the likeness of their own homes\r\nand their own country. Here, for instance, is a picture of an Italian\r\ncity in gala attire, somewhat idealised, no doubt, in splendour, but\r\notherwise a \"perfectly true representation of what the architecture of\r\nItaly was in her glorious time; trim, dainty,--red and white like the\r\nblossom of a carnation,--touched with gold like a peacock's plumes,\r\nand frescoed, even to its chimney-pots, with fairest arabesques,--its\r\ninhabitants, and it together, one harmony of work and life\" (_Guide\r\nto the Venetian Academy_, p. 21). And secondly, the picture shows\r\nthe pleasure the painters took in their accessories, and the frank\r\nhumour--free at once from irreverence and from gloom--with which the\r\nVenetians especially approached what was to them a religion of daily\r\nlife. Notice especially the little girl at the top of the steps on the\r\nleft, looking round the corner. The whole of this side of the picture\r\nshows a naturalistic treatment which forms \"a curious accompaniment\r\nand contrast to Crivelli's ordinary conventional manner. The group\r\ntalking with a friar at the house door, the citizen who passes along\r\nbent on business, the dandy who shades his eyes from the sun and looks\r\nup at the house, the figures on the arch, and the people walking in\r\nthe open space by the town walls beyond, make up a picture of real\r\nlife unequalled among Crivelli's works\" (Rushworth's _Crivelli_, p.\r\n63). As a representation of the \"Annunciation,\" the picture should be\r\ncompared and contrasted with Lippi's (666). The Madonna and the Angel,\r\n\"though essential to the work from the point of view of the patrons,\r\nwho commissioned it, were merely its occasion from the point of view\r\nof that extraordinarily painstaking and detail-loving creature, its\r\npainter. There is endless profusion of decorative work; elaborate\r\narabesques on the pilasters of the Madonna's lordly house, elaborate\r\ncapitals, elaborate loggias, an elaborate cornice. The grain of the\r\nwood on her reading-desk is carefully painted; so are the planks in\r\nthe wall of her bedchamber.... Besides the endless interest of its\r\ndecorative work, this picture is useful as marking the difference\r\nbetween the spiritual and ideal motives which dominated Florence, and\r\nthe worldly motives of richness and splendour which dominated Venice.\r\nCompare its purely adventitious detail with the poetical background of\r\nFilippo Lippi. In the Florentine, the detail is there for the sake\r\nof the picture; in the Venetian, the picture is there for the sake of\r\nthe detail\" (Grant Allen, in the _Pall Mall Magazine_, July 1895). See\r\nunder 1139 for further notes on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe picture is signed and dated, 1486, at the bottom of the\r\npilasters of the Virgin's chamber. On the face of the step below\r\nis an inscription between three coats of arms (the Bishop's, the\r\nPope's, and the town's)--_Libertas Ecclesiastica_, which is of some\r\nhistorical interest. In the year 1482 the city of Ascoli came to an\r\nagreement with the Pope, whereby, in return for an annual tribute\r\nand the acknowledgment of his suzerainty, the Pope issued a Bull in\r\nfavour of its citizens, conferring on them municipal Home Rule. A new\r\nphrase--_Libertas Ecclesiastica_, Independence under the Church--was\r\ninvented to describe the new settlement. The arrival of the Charter\r\non March 25, the Feast of the Annunciation, was celebrated henceforth\r\nby ceremonies on that day, in which a procession to the church of the\r\nAnnunziata was a prominent feature. Our picture was painted for that\r\nchurch, where it remained until 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n740. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Sassoferrato_ (Eclectic: 1605-1685). _See 200._\r\n\r\n\r\n741. THE DEAD ORLANDO.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Velazquez_.[175] _See under 197._\r\n\r\nThe closing scene, according to one of the many legends, in the\r\nhistory of that \"peerless paladin,\" Orlando, or Roland, who was slain\r\nat the battle of Roncesvalles, when returning from Charlemagne's\r\nexpedition against the Saracens in Spain. Invulnerable to the sword,\r\nhe was squeezed to death by Bernardo del Carpio. He lies, therefore,\r\nprostrate, but fully dressed and armed, his right hand resting on his\r\nchest, his left on the hilt of his famous sword. Over the dead man's\r\nfeet there hangs from a branch a small brass lamp, the flame of which,\r\nlike the hero's life, has just expired. On either side are the skulls\r\nand bones of other \"paladins and peers who on Roncesvalles died.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n742. PORTRAIT OF A LAWYER.\r\n\r\n  _Moroni_ (Bergamese: 1525-1578). _See 697._\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of the painter's third or naturalistic manner.\r\nThere is an ease of attitude and an absence of constraint which makes\r\nthe portrait transparently natural.\r\n\r\n\r\n744. THE \"GARVAGH MADONNA.\"\r\n\r\n  _Raphael_ (Umbrian: 1483-1520). _See 1171._\r\n\r\nThis picture--known as the \"Garvagh Madonna,\" from its former owner,\r\nLord Garvagh, or the \"Aldobrandini Madonna,\" from having originally\r\nbelonged to the Aldobrandini apartments of the Borghese Palace at\r\nRome--belongs to Raphael's third or Roman period, and a comparison\r\nwith the \"Ansidei\" shows the changes in feeling between the painter's\r\nearlier and later manners. The devotional character of the Umbrian\r\nSchool is less marked. In the \"Ansidei Madonna\" the divinity of the\r\nVirgin is insisted on; and above her throne is the inscription \"Hail,\r\nMother of Christ.\" But here the divinity is only dimly indicated by a\r\nhalo. And as the Madonna is here a merely human mother, so is the child\r\na purely human child. The saints in contemplation of the \"Ansidei\" are\r\nreplaced by a little St. John, and the two children play with a pink.\r\nThe expressions of the children, as indeed the whole picture, are full\r\nof sweetness and beauty.[176] Very beautiful too is the pyramidal\r\ncomposition of the group. Of the ultimate significance of the change\r\nmarked by Raphael's third manner, Ruskin says that it--\r\n\r\n      \"Was all the more fatal because at first veiled by an\r\n      appearance of greater dignity and sincerity than were\r\n      possessed by the older art. One of the earliest results of\r\n      the new knowledge was the putting away the greater part of\r\n      the _unlikelihoods_ and fineries of the ancient pictures, and\r\n      an apparently closer following of nature and probability.\r\n      The appearances of nature were more closely followed in\r\n      everything; and the crowned Queen-Virgin of Perugino sank\r\n      into a simple Italian mother in Raphael's 'Madonna of the\r\n      Chair.' ... But the glittering childishness of the old art\r\n      was rejected, not because it was false, but because it was\r\n      easy; and, still more, because the painter had no longer any\r\n      religious passion to express. He could think of the Madonna\r\n      now very calmly, with no desire to pour out the treasures of\r\n      earth at her feet, or cover her brows with the golden shafts of\r\n      heaven. He could think of her as an available subject for the\r\n      display of transparent shadows, skilful tints, and scientific\r\n      foreshortenings,--as a fair woman, forming, if well painted, a\r\n      pleasant piece of furniture for the corner of a boudoir, and\r\n      best imagined by combination of the beauties of the prettiest\r\n      contadinas\"[177] (_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. iv.\r\n      §§ 12, 13).\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be remembered that the \"Madonna di San Sisto,\"\r\nperhaps the most spiritual of all Raphael's conceptions, was the latest\r\nof the series.\r\n\r\n\r\n745. KING PHILIP IV. OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish: 1599-1660). _See 197._\r\n\r\nFew kings have left so many enduring monuments of themselves as\r\nPhilip IV., whose face figures twice on these walls and meets one\r\nin nearly every European gallery. But nowhere, perhaps, has it been\r\nmore supremely rendered than on this canvas, where the king seems to\r\nlive and move before us. The picture is \"perhaps the finest example\r\nof oil-painting accessible to the British student. Though one of the\r\nlater works of the master, it is constructed out of a carefully wrought\r\nand smooth impasto, without any 'bravura' strokes. The lights are\r\nnowhere loaded. The hair is painted, not modelled; the jewels on the\r\ndress are easily touched in without relief-effect or juggling. The\r\nwonder of the thing is the infinite variety over a surface so simply\r\ntreated. The face is in such broad, even light that one has to adopt\r\nsome device which brings it freshly into the field of vision--as by\r\nturning the head down or looking at it through the hand--in order\r\nto see how firm is the modelling. The flesh-tints are simple enough.\r\nYet take almost any square inch of surface on the face--say the upper\r\nlip with its moustache--and note the effect of each one of the free\r\nbrush-strokes which draw the pale, umber hair over the warm rubbing\r\non the flesh; or in the cold, lack-lustre, blue eye, measure the\r\napparent ease of the touches against their firm, incisive clearness.\r\nEverything is there--form, expression--in a word, the life; but it has\r\nall grown into perfection on the canvas so quietly, so smoothly, as\r\nif Velazquez had indeed painted with the will only and not with the\r\nhand\" (Baldwin Brown: _The Fine Arts_, p. 319). \"Velazquez fuses his\r\ncolours in a way that baffles painters. They melt into each other by\r\nimperceptible gradations, as he deals with plane after plane in his\r\nsubtly-modelled faces. Observe the action of light on the pallid face\r\nof the worn-out king, giving to the skin the breath of life in its\r\ndelicate transparency\" (_Quarterly Review_, April 1899).\r\n\r\nThe face is one which, once seen, is not soon forgotten. Velazquez,\r\nas we have said, caught its expression at once, and by comparing the\r\nface in its youth (1129) with its middle age here, one can almost\r\ntrace the king's career. In youth we see him cold and phlegmatic,\r\nbut slender in figure graceful and dignified in bearing, and with a\r\nfine open forehead. But the young king was bent on ease and pleasure,\r\nand his minister Olivares did nothing to persuade him into more\r\nactive kingship. The less pleasing traits in his character have, in\r\nconsequence, come to be deeper impressed at the time of this later\r\nportrait. He was devoted to sport, and the cruelty of the Spaniard\r\nis conspicuous in the lip--more underhung now than before. In the\r\ngrowth of the double chin and yet greater impassiveness of expression,\r\none may see the traces of that \"talent for dead silence and marble\r\nimmobility\" which, says the historian, \"he so highly improved that\r\nhe could sit out a comedy without stirring hand or foot, and conduct\r\nan audience without movement of a muscle, except those in his lips\r\nand tongue.\" It is not the face of a great ruler; but it is one which\r\nrightly lives on a painter's canvas, for no king was ever at once so\r\nliberal and so enlightened a patron of the arts as he. Himself too he\r\nwas something of an artist; and the best-known piece of his painting\r\ntells a pretty story, which it is pleasant to remember in front of\r\nVelazquez's portraits of him. Velazquez painted once his own portrait\r\nin the background of the king's family (the \"Maids of Honour\"--Las\r\nMeninas--now at Madrid). \"Is there anything wrong with it?\" Velazquez\r\nasked. \"Yes,\" said the king, taking the palette in his hand, \"just\r\nthis\"--and he sketched in on the painter's portrait the coveted red\r\ncross of the order of Santiago. \"In all his portraits Philip wears the\r\n_golilla_, a stiff linen collar projecting at right angles from the\r\nneck. It was invented by the king, who was very proud of it. In regard\r\nto the wonderful structure of Philip's moustaches, it is said that, to\r\npreserve their form, they were encased during the night in perfumed\r\nleather covers called _bigoteras_\" (J. F. White, in _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_).\r\n\r\n\r\n746. A LANDSCAPE WITH RUINS.\r\n\r\n  _Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1628-1682). _See 627._\r\n\r\nThis picture is signed and dated 1673.\r\n\r\n\r\n747. ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST AND ST. LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Hans Memlinc. See 686._\r\n\r\nSt. Lawrence may nearly always be distinguished by his gridiron--the\r\nemblem of his martyrdom. He was a pious deacon of the Christian Church,\r\nwho was put to death by the Romans. A new kind of torture was, says the\r\nlegend, prepared for him. He was stretched on a sort of bed, formed of\r\niron bars in the manner of a gridiron, and was roasted alive. \"But so\r\ngreat was his constancy that in the middle of his torments he said,\r\n'Seest thou not, O thou foolish man, that I am already roasted on one\r\nside, and that, if thou wouldst have me well cooked, it is time to turn\r\nme on the other?' Then St. Lawrence lifted up his eyes, and his pure\r\nand invincible spirit fled to heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n748. MADONNA AND CHILD, WITH ST. ANNE.\r\n\r\n  _Girolamo dai Libri_ (Veronese: 1474-1556).\r\n\r\n      Girolamo inherited his surname (\"of the books\") from\r\n      the occupation of his father, who was an illuminator of\r\n      manuscripts. Girolamo himself excelled in this branch of art,\r\n      but he also became famous as a painter of altar-pieces. He\r\n      had \"a playful fancy, and loved to introduce into his pictures\r\n      festoons of flowers and fruit, trees of rich green foliage\r\n      bearing lemons and oranges, and angels singing and playing on\r\n      musical instruments. He was a true Veronese in his feeling\r\n      for colour, which in his works is always rich and gay. In his\r\n      backgrounds are frequently seen distant views of his native\r\n      city, with her castellated hills and blue mountains\" (Layard,\r\n      i. 269). Girolamo, whose friendship with Francesco Morone\r\n      (285) is on record, was born in Verona, and it is there that\r\n      many of his principal works are preserved. In the Pinacoteca\r\n      are several charming pictures, and there also is a collection\r\n      of Girolamo's missals. In S. Giorgio Maggiore is a \"Madonna\r\n      Enthroned,\" dated 1526, which is by many considered the\r\n      painter's masterpiece. The German artist Ludwig Richter,[178]\r\n      thus records (in his _Lebenserinnerungen_) the impression\r\n      it made upon him:--\"I thought that I had scarcely ever seen\r\n      anything so beautiful and touching. The picture was by Girolamo\r\n      dai Libri, an old master of whom until then I had never heard,\r\n      nor, indeed, have I seen any other picture by him since. Here\r\n      it was that there first arose in me a suspicion of what a depth\r\n      of spiritual life, and of the heavenly beauty that is born\r\n      of it, lay in the masters of the pre-Raphaelite period. The\r\n      master's way of seeing and feeling, his style--and the style\r\n      is the man--impressed me deeply and permanently, touched me\r\n      sympathetically. In fact this dear old painter became veritably\r\n      my patron saint, for he it was who first opened to me the gates\r\n      of the inner sanctuary of Art\" (quoted by Dr. Richter, in the\r\n      _Art Journal_, February, 1895).\r\n\r\nA picture \"with a pedigree,\" being mentioned by Vasari. \"In the church\r\nof the Scala (at Verona),\" he says, in his life of the painter, \"the\r\npicture of the Madonna with St. Anna is by his hand, and is placed\r\nbetween the San Sebastiano of Il Moro and the San Rocco of Cavazzola\r\n(Morando).\" The latter picture (735) and Girolamo's now hang on the\r\nsame wall of our Gallery. In the composition of this picture one may\r\ntrace, perhaps, the influence of the dainty work Girolamo was first\r\naccustomed to. Thus the trefoil, or cloverleaf pattern, is followed\r\nboth in the arrangement of the Virgin, St. Anne, and the Child, and in\r\nthat of the little playing angels below. Notice the pretty trellis-work\r\nof roses on either side, and the slain dragon at the Virgin's feet,\r\nemblematic (the latter) of Christ's victory over the powers of evil,\r\nand (the former) of the \"ways of pleasantness\" and \"paths of peace\"\r\nthat he came to prepare.\r\n\r\n\r\n749. THE GIUSTI FAMILY OF VERONA.\r\n\r\n  _Niccolo Giolfino_ (Veronese: painted 1486-1518).\r\n\r\nLittle is known of this painter except that he was a friend of\r\nMantegna. The façade of his house at Verona was painted with frescoes,\r\nthe upper part by Mantegna, the lower by Giolfino himself. He was\r\nprobably a scholar of Liberale, to whose altar-piece in the cathedral\r\nat Verona he added the wings. One of his best works is a large\r\naltar-piece in S. Anastasia in that city.\r\n\r\nTwo groups of family portraits, chiefly interesting for studies in\r\ncostume, originally in one picture, which formed the _predella_ of an\r\naltar-piece: hence the upward look of some of the faces.\r\n\r\n\r\n750. THE DOGE GIOVANNI MOCENIGO.\r\n\r\n  _Lazzaro Bastiani_ (Venetian: about 1425-1512).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThis picture was, until recently, ascribed to Carpaccio, of whom,\r\ntherefore, some account is here retained. It was once inscribed with\r\nCarpaccio's name and the date 1479, but these, having been shown to be\r\nfalse, were removed. The work is now attributed, in accordance with the\r\nconclusions reached by Signor Molmenti and Dr. Ludwig[179] to Bastiani.\r\n\r\n      Lazzaro Bastiani was for many years the victim of one of\r\n      Vasari's confusions. Carpaccio, we are told by that authority,\r\n      \"taught his art to two of his brothers, both of whom imitated\r\n      him closely; one of these was called Lazzaro, the other\r\n      Sebastiano.\" No such painters existed; but the name of Lazzaro\r\n      Bastiani is on record as that of a painter already at work in\r\n      1449. The presumption is, therefore, that he was not taught by,\r\n      but the master of, Carpaccio, by which latter painter there\r\n      is no dated work before 1490. Numerous records of later works\r\n      by Bastiani from 1449 onwards have been discovered; and there\r\n      is a public document of December 11, 1508, in which Bastiani\r\n      and Carpaccio were appointed to value the frescoes executed by\r\n      Giorgione on the Fondaco dei Tedeschi. Our picture, hitherto\r\n      supposed to be an early work of Carpaccio, should be compared\r\n      with the signed and dated (1484) work of Bastiani in the Duomo\r\n      of Murano, representing a Canon kneeling before the Virgin.\r\n      Other pictures by him are in the Academies of Vienna and Venice\r\n      respectively.\r\n\r\n      Various technical similarities between the work of Bastiani and\r\n      Carpaccio are pointed out by Sig. Molmenti and Dr. Ludwig, but\r\n      Bastiani's pictures lack the charm and gaiety of Carpaccio and\r\n      his chief claim to fame is that which the critics now award him\r\n      of having been the master of that great painter.\r\n\r\n      The works of Vittore Carpaccio (about 1450-1522) have of recent\r\n      years attracted great attention owing to the prominence given\r\n      to them by Ruskin in all his writings since 1870. Of \"The\r\n      Presentation\" in the Venetian Academy (dated 1510) he says:\r\n      \"You may measure yourself, outside and in,--your religion,\r\n      your taste, your knowledge of art, your knowledge of men and\r\n      things,--by the quantity of admiration which honestly, after\r\n      due time given, you can feel for this picture. You are not\r\n      required to think the Madonna pretty, or to receive the same\r\n      religious delight from the conception of the scene which\r\n      you would rightly receive from Angelico, Filippo Lippi, or\r\n      Perugino. This is essentially Venetian,--prosaic, matter\r\n      of fact,--retaining its supreme common-sense through all\r\n      enthusiasm. Nor are you required to think this a first-rate\r\n      work in Venetian colour. This is the best picture in the\r\n      Academy, precisely because it is _not_ the best piece of\r\n      colour there;--because the great master has subdued his own\r\n      main passion, and restrained his colour-faculty, though the\r\n      best in Venice, that you might _not_ say the moment you came\r\n      before the picture, as you do of the Paris Bordone, '_What_ a\r\n      piece of colour!' Carpaccio does not want you to think of _his_\r\n      colour, but of _your_ Christ.... If you begin really to feel\r\n      the picture, observe that its supreme merit is in the exactly\r\n      just balance of all virtue;--detail perfect, yet inconspicuous;\r\n      composition intricate and severe, but concealed under apparent\r\n      simplicity; and painter's faculty of the supremest, used\r\n      nevertheless with entire subjection of it to intellectual\r\n      purpose.\" Other powers of Carpaccio are better seen in the St.\r\n      Ursula Series, also in the Venetian Academy, and since Ruskin's\r\n      day honourably hung. \"They are,\" says Layard, \"masterly works,\r\n      rich in all that gives value and grandeur to historical art.\r\n      The rather monotonous history which forms the groundwork of\r\n      many of them is throughout varied and elevated by a free\r\n      style of grouping and by happy moral allusions. The colours,\r\n      notwithstanding injudicious cleanings and restorations, still\r\n      shine with the purest light. The variety of expression,\r\n      always lifelike, in the many figures, their beautiful and\r\n      simple action, and the admirable dramatic representation of\r\n      the different incidents connected with the story, give these\r\n      pictures an inexpressible charm. The subject of the dream of\r\n      the young St. Ursula, in bed in her chamber, with her table and\r\n      an open book upon it and her vase of flowers, has a purity and\r\n      simplicity quite unique\" (i. 320). These pictures were painted\r\n      1490-5. Of later date (1502-1511) is the series in the little\r\n      church of S. Giorgio degli Schiavoni. They are full of the\r\n      charm of picturesque reality, the wealth of rich and quaint\r\n      accessories, the playful fancy and penetrative imagination,\r\n      which characterise Carpaccio. Occasional works by him are to\r\n      be seen in various continental galleries (_e.g._ Milan and\r\n      Ferrara); but it is only in Venice that any adequate conception\r\n      of him can be formed. Of his life little is known. He was\r\n      born either in one of the Venetian islands, or in Istria. He\r\n      generally signed himself \"Victor Carpathius.\" Vasari calls him\r\n      Scarpaccia; in old Venetian documents, he is Scarpaza. \"He was\r\n      associated with Gentile Bellini in executing the historical\r\n      paintings for the Hall of the Great Council in the Ducal\r\n      Palace, and it has been thought possible that he accompanied\r\n      Gentile to Constantinople as an assistant. The minute knowledge\r\n      of Oriental customs and costumes which his works display\r\n      suggests that he had visited the East, and even those parts\r\n      of it which were then still under the sway of the Sultans of\r\n      Egypt\" (Burton). Ruskin's criticisms, and descriptions of\r\n      his principal pictures, will be found in his _Guide to the\r\n      Academy at Venice, St. Mark's Rest_ (Supplements), and _Fors\r\n      Clavigera_, 1872, xx.; 1873, xxvi.; 1876, pp. 329, 340, 357,\r\n      381; 1877, p. 26; 1878, p. 182. An earlier reference is in the\r\n      Oxford _Lectures on Art_, § 73. Copies from some of Carpaccio's\r\n      \"Schiavoni\" pictures are in the Arundel Society's Collection.\r\n      Copies of the \"Ursula\" series and other pictures made for\r\n      Ruskin are in the St. George's Museum at Sheffield.\r\n\r\nThis is a votive picture commissioned by Giovanni Mocenigo (who\r\nreigned over Venice 1477-1485), to be presented by him, according\r\nto the custom with reigning doges, to the Ducal Palace. The scene\r\nselected represents the doge kneeling before the Virgin and begging\r\nher protection on the occasion of the plague of 1478. The gold vase on\r\nthe altar before the throne contains medicaments, for which, according\r\nto the inscription below, a blessing is invoked: \"Celestial Virgin,\r\npreserve the City and Republic of Venice and the Venetian State, and\r\nextend your protection to me if I deserve it.\" Behind the doge is his\r\npatron saint St. John, on the opposite side is St. Christopher. The\r\nsetting thus chosen for the doge's picture is characteristic. \"The\r\nfirst step towards the ennobling of any face is the ridding it of its\r\nvanity; to which aim there cannot be anything more contrary than that\r\nprinciple of portraiture which prevails with us in these days, whose\r\nend seems to be the expression of vanity throughout, in face and in\r\nall circumstances of accompaniment; tending constantly to insolence\r\nof attitude, and levity and haughtiness of expression, and worked out\r\nfurther in mean accompaniments of worldly splendour and possession;\r\ntogether with hints or proclamations of what the person has done or\r\nsupposes himself to have done, which, if known, it is gratuitous in the\r\nportrait to exhibit, and, if unknown, it is insolent to proclaim.... To\r\nwhich practices are to be opposed ... the mighty and simple modesty\r\nof ... Venice, where we find the ... doges not set forth with thrones\r\nand curtains of state, but kneeling, always crownless, and returning\r\nthanks to God for his help; or as priests, interceding for the nation\r\nin its affliction\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch.\r\nxiv. § 19). The picture was bought in 1865 from the Doge's descendant,\r\nAloise Count Mocenigo di Sant' Eustachio.\r\n\r\n\r\n751. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Santi_ (Umbrian: about 1440-1494).\r\n\r\n      This picture is of peculiar interest because it is by Raphael's\r\n      father. It does not, however, give a full idea of the extent\r\n      to which Raphael's talent was hereditary, for Giovanni's easel\r\n      pictures, such as this, are inferior to his wall pictures.\r\n      The young Raphael had all the advantages of an atmosphere of\r\n      artistic culture. Giovanni, like his father before him, was\r\n      a well-to-do burgher, and kept originally a general retail\r\n      shop, but he afterwards--under the teaching, it is thought,\r\n      of Melozzo da Forli--took to painting, and his house, if one\r\n      may judge from Piero della Francesca's visit in 1467, was a\r\n      resort of painters. At the brilliant court of Duke Federigo of\r\n      Urbino, Giovanni moreover acquired a taste for literature, and\r\n      there is a long rhyming chronicle by him extant in which he\r\n      describes the Duke's visit to Mantua, and amongst other things\r\n      praises greatly the works of Mantegna, Melozzo, and Piero\r\n      della Francesca. But to see how much of Raphael's genius was\r\n      original, one has only to compare this picture by the father\r\n      with one (say 744) by the son. Giovanni's female heads are not\r\n      without a mild dignity of their own; but his works lack the\r\n      soft grace and winning charm that distinguish his son's.\r\n\r\n\"Worth study, in spite of what critics say of its crudity. Concede its\r\nimmaturity, at least, though an immaturity visibly susceptible of a\r\ndelicate grace, it wins you nevertheless to return again and again,\r\nand ponder, by a sincere expression of sorrow, profound, yet resigned,\r\nbe the cause what it may, among all the causes of sorrow inherent in\r\nthe ideal of maternity, human or divine. But if you keep in mind,\r\nwhen looking at it, the facts of Raphael's childhood,[180] you will\r\nrecognise in his father's picture, not the anticipated sorrow of the\r\nMater Dolorosa over the dead son, but the grief of a simple household\r\nover the mother herself taken early from it. This may have been the\r\nfirst picture the eyes of the world's great painter of Madonnas rested\r\non; and if he stood diligently before it to copy, and so copying,\r\nquite unconsciously, and with no disloyalty to his original, refined,\r\nimproved, substituted,--substituted himself, in fact, his finer\r\nself--he had already struck the persistent note of his career\" (Pater:\r\n_Miscellaneous Studies_, p. 32).\r\n\r\n\r\n752. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Lippo Dalmasii_ (Bolognese: painted 1376-1410).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nA picture by a Bolognese artist, of the _Giottesque_ period, Lippo,\r\nson of Dalmasius, called also \"Lippo of the Madonna,\" from the many\r\npictures like this he painted: no Bolognese gentleman's family, we are\r\ntold, was considered complete without one.\r\n\r\n\r\n753. ON THE ROAD TO EMMAUS.\r\n\r\n  _Altobello Melone_ (Cremonese: painted about 1500).\r\n\r\n      There was no native and independent school of Cremona. Melone\r\n      was a pupil of Romanino at Brescia. He painted some of the\r\n      frescoes in the nave of Cremona Cathedral.\r\n\r\nTwo of Christ's disciples are walking after his death and burial to\r\nEmmaus. The risen Christ \"drew near, and went with them. But their\r\neyes were holden, that they should not know him\" (Luke xxiv. 16). The\r\npainter makes excuses for the disciples not recognising their Master by\r\nnaïvely dressing Him as a tourist with an alpenstock.\r\n\r\n\r\n  755. RHETORIC.}\r\n  756. MUSIC.   }\r\n\r\n  _Melozzo da Forli_ (Umbrian: 1438-1494).\r\n\r\n      Melozzo, born at Forli in the Romagna, near Ravenna, is classed\r\n      with the Umbrian School, both because he studied (it is\r\n      believed) under Piero della Francesca, and because he worked at\r\n      Urbino. Giovanni Santi, who was his friend, especially praises\r\n      Melozzo, \"to me so dear,\" for his skill in perspective; and,\r\n      like many other artists of these times, he was an architect\r\n      as well as a painter. In 1472 he was in Rome; he was one of\r\n      the original members of the Roman Academy of St. Luke, founded\r\n      by Sixtus IV., and in the book of the Academy he signs his\r\n      name as \"Painter to the Pope.\" Some of his Roman frescoes are\r\n      preserved. In the Vatican gallery is a fresco transferred to\r\n      canvas, commemorating the restoration of the Vatican Library\r\n      and containing many portraits. This work has been published by\r\n      the Arundel Society, but Melozzo is more widely known by the\r\n      figures of angels playing on musical instruments, now in the\r\n      sacristy of St. Peter's, which have been published by the same\r\n      Society. These grand figures of youths with abundant flowing\r\n      hair are \"among the most beautiful and masterful creations\r\n      of the Renaissance spirit, caught up, it would seem, into a\r\n      certain ecstasy and rapture of divine things.\" Portions of a\r\n      fresco, painted for SS. Apostoli, representing the Ascension\r\n      of our Lord, are now on the staircase of the Quirinal Palace.\r\n      The work was \"one of the most grand and daring feats of\r\n      foreshadowing that art has bequeathed, and may be considered\r\n      as the first illustration of that science which Mantegna and\r\n      Correggio further developed\" (Kugler). In this connection we\r\n      may notice in our pictures that \"the steps and the figures\r\n      thereon are drawn in perspective, as if they were real objects\r\n      seen from below; they present the earliest example the Gallery\r\n      possesses of this kind of perspective illusion, which was\r\n      practised with great success by Mantegna, and carried out on\r\n      the grandest scale by Michael Angelo in the ceiling of the\r\n      Sistine chapel\" (Monkhouse, _In the National Gallery_, p. 115).\r\n      About the year 1480 Melozzo went to Urbino, where he executed\r\n      the work described below. In Forli itself a few frescoes by\r\n      Melozzo survive. In the British Museum there are some drawings\r\n      by this rare master.\r\n\r\nThese pictures are two of a series of seven, which were painted for\r\nthe good Duke Frederick to decorate the library of the Ducal Palace\r\nat Urbino. The words on the frieze above our pictures are portions\r\nof a running inscription describing the Duke's style and titles. He\r\nwas created \"Gonfaloniere of the Church\" (756) in 1465 and \"Duke\r\nof Urbino\" (755) in 1474. The series represented symbolically the\r\nseven arts--grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, music, geometry,\r\nand astronomy--which, until the close of the Middle Ages, formed\r\nthe curriculum of a liberal education. Notice in both pictures that\r\nthe figures of the learners are kneeling--an attitude symbolical of\r\nthe spirit of reverence and humility which distinguishes the true\r\nscholar (\"I prayed, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me\"); whilst\r\nthe figures representing the sciences to be learned are seated on\r\nthrones--symbolical of the true kingship that consists in knowledge\r\n(\"And I set her before kingdoms and thrones\"), and are clothed about\r\nwith pearls and other precious stones (\"She is more precious than\r\nrubies\").\r\n\r\nIn the picture of Rhetoric (755) the youth is being taught not to\r\nspeak, but to read--\"You must not speak,\" the Queen of Rhetoric seems\r\nto tell him, \"until you have something to say.\" Notice, too, that\r\nRhetoric is robed in cold gray. \"You think Rhetoric should be glowing,\r\nfervid, impetuous? No. Above all things,--cool.\"\r\n\r\nBut Music (756) is robed in bright red, the colour of delight. The book\r\nnow is closed. \"After learning to reason, you will learn to sing; for\r\nyou will want to. There is so much reason for singing in this sweet\r\nworld, when one thinks rightly of it.\" Music points her scholar to a\r\nsmall organ--\"not that you are never to sing anything but hymns, but\r\nthat whatever is rightly called music, or work of the Muses, is divine\r\nin help and healing\" (_Mornings in Florence_, v. 128, 134). Hanging\r\nfrom the wall on the left, almost above the scholar's head, is a sprig\r\nof bay, the Muses' crown. Other pictures of this same series are in the\r\ngallery at Berlin and in the Royal Collection at Windsor. The latter\r\nis of peculiar interest in the history of the Renaissance. It shows\r\nthe Duke, his son and the Court, and a black-robed humanist, seated in\r\na sort of pulpit--\"the unique representation of a scene of frequent\r\noccurrence in the Courts of Italy, where listening to lectures formed a\r\npart of every day's occupation\" (_see_ the description in Symonds, ii.\r\np. 221).\r\n\r\n\r\n757. CHRIST BLESSING LITTLE CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Dutch: School of Rembrandt).\r\n\r\nThis is one of the nation's conspicuously bad bargains. It was bought\r\nin 1866 as a Rembrandt and at a Rembrandt price (£7000), but was soon\r\nrecognised as being only a work by some pupil. It is easy to be wise\r\nafter the event, but it certainly seems strange that the connoisseurs\r\nof the time, even if technical differences had escaped them, should\r\nnot have seen a lack of Rembrandt's power about this work. A writer in\r\nthe _Times_ (June 24, 1888) has no hesitation in ascribing the picture\r\nto Nicolas Maes. He says: \"If it was painted by Maes it would probably\r\nhave been after the series of small works, mostly dating about 1656.\r\nMaes was a pupil of Rembrandt in 1650, at the time when the master's\r\ntreatment of sacred subjects was more direct than in his earlier years.\r\nIn this picture fanciful costume is discarded, and the figures are\r\npainted straight from the life. The figure of Christ is, indeed, weak\r\nand conventional, but it is not to be expected that a young man would\r\nhere be successful in a figure so foreign to his general practice;\r\nand, if we admit the supposition that the composition followed the\r\nsmall panels, the relaxation of style pervading the entire work tallies\r\nwith the known facts of the career of Maes, who between 1660 and 1670\r\nappears to have devoted himself almost entirely to portrait painting;\r\nthese representations of Dutch and Antwerp burghers, though solid and\r\nrespectable, possess none of the charm and interest of the earlier\r\nworks owing their inspiration to the direct influence of Rembrandt.\"\r\n(See, for instance, No. 1277.) Some ascribe the picture with equal\r\nassurance to Lievens (see 1095); see an article by Ford Madox Brown\r\nin the _Magazine of Art_, Feb. 1890; others to Eeckhout (see _The\r\nAthenæum_, Jan. 19, 1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n758. PORTRAIT OF THE COUNTESS PALMA OF URBINO.\r\n\r\n  _Piero della Francesca_ (Umbrian: 1416-1492). _See 665._\r\n\r\n      Ascribed by Morelli to Paolo Uccello. \"The treatment of\r\n      the hair recalls that of one of the portraits in Paolo's\r\n      battle-piece (583), while Piero used to represent curls in a\r\n      thin and thread-like shape. The ornament on the left sleeve of\r\n      the lady also reminds one of the decoration on the standard\"\r\n      (Richter's _Italian Art in the National Gallery_, p. 17). \"Of\r\n      purely Florentine origin, and with its hardness of outline and\r\n      modelling, and its severity of aspect, resembles a Pesellino\r\n      writ large\" (Claude Phillips in the _Academy_, Sept. 28, 1889).\r\n\r\nThis and the other profile head once ascribed to Piero (585) \"are\r\nprobably the earliest specimens we have in the National Gallery of pure\r\nportraits, _i.e._ pictures devoted simply to record the likeness of an\r\nindividual, first introduced as donors into votive pictures, and next\r\nas actors in scenes from sacred history and legend. Portraits have\r\nat length made good their claim to a separate existence in pictorial\r\nart\" (Monkhouse: _The Italian Pre-Raphaelites_, p. 41). To Piero\r\ndella Francesca also we owe \"most precious portraits (at Rimini and\r\nin the Uffizi) of two Italian princes, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta\r\nand Federigo of Urbino, masterpieces of fidelity to nature and sound\r\nworkmanship\" (Symonds).\r\n\r\n\r\n766, 767. HEADS OF SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Veneziano_ (died 1461).\r\n\r\n      Though Domenico describes himself as Venetian (as on the\r\n      signature to 1215), he worked at Perugia and Florence, and his\r\n      works belie any connection with Venetian art. Between 1439 and\r\n      1445 he was engaged in the church of S. Maria Nuova, in which\r\n      work he was assisted by his pupil Piero della Francesca.\r\n      These pictures have perished. The works by his hand we possess\r\n      give no evidence of his being an oil painter, but he is known\r\n      to have used oil, and indeed was celebrated as one of the\r\n      earliest Italian painters in that medium. Vasari's story about\r\n      Andrea del Castagno's jealousy, and his murder of Domenico\r\n      in consequence, is disproved by documentary evidence showing\r\n      that Domenico survived his alleged murderer by five years.\r\n      Domenico's only known works, now extant, are an altar-piece in\r\n      the Uffizi and the work described below.\r\n\r\nThese heads are from the niche or tabernacle which contained the\r\nMadonna and Child, No. 1215. The work was executed for the Canto\r\n(street corner) de' Carnesecchi in Florence. It is thus referred to by\r\nVasari:--\r\n\r\n      Being invited to Florence, the first thing Domenico did was to\r\n      paint a tabernacle in fresco, at the corner of the Carnesecchi,\r\n      in the angle of the two roads, leading, the one to the new, the\r\n      other to the old Piazza of Santa Maria Novella. The subject of\r\n      this work is a Virgin surrounded by various saints, and as it\r\n      pleased the Florentines greatly and was much commended by the\r\n      artists of the time, as well as by the citizens, this picture\r\n      awakened bitter rage and envy against poor Domenico in the\r\n      ill-regulated mind of Andrea (ii. 99--here follows Vasari's\r\n      rattling and reckless story of Domenico's murder by the jealous\r\n      Andrea del Castagno).\r\n\r\nFor centuries Domenico's work was exposed to wind and weather. The\r\nheads, Nos. 766, 767, passed into the possession of Sir Charles\r\nEastlake, from whose collection they were purchased for the National\r\nGallery in 1867. The central fresco (No. 1215) was in 1851 detached\r\nfrom the wall and badly restored. It was subsequently acquired by Lord\r\nLindsay, the author of _Sketches of the History of Christian Art_,\r\nwhose son, James, Earl of Crawford and Balcarres, presented it to the\r\nnation in 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n768. ST. PETER AND ST. JEROME.\r\n\r\n  _Antonio Vivarini_ (Venetian: died 1470).\r\n\r\n      Antonio da Murano, called also Antonio Vivarini, was the eldest\r\n      of a family of painters, who played a part in the development\r\n      of the Venetian School corresponding to that of Giotto and his\r\n      circle in the Florentine School. The Venetian is, it will be\r\n      seen, a century later than the Florentine (_cf._ Introduction).\r\n      It was at the adjacent island of Murano (where most of the\r\n      Venetian glass is now made, and which was once the resort of\r\n      the wealthier Venetian citizens) that an independent school\r\n      first developed itself, Antonio and his brother Bartolommeo\r\n      (see 284) being natives of that place. The work of the\r\n      Vivarini was to impart a distinctively artistic impulse to the\r\n      conventional craftsmanship which previously prevailed in Venice\r\n      in accordance with Byzantine traditions. Recently published\r\n      documents (dated 1272) give a curious insight into the position\r\n      and work of the earliest Venetian painters (see Richter's\r\n      _Lectures on the National Gallery_, pp. 23-29). They were\r\n      treated merely as artisans. They were engaged for the most part\r\n      in work which would now be classed as industrial craftsmanship\r\n      in painting arms and furniture. Paintings, in our sense of the\r\n      word, were an unimportant and occasional branch of their work.\r\n      The division of labour which in our own day is a frequent cause\r\n      of industrial disputes (as, for instance, between builders and\r\n      plasterers) was then in dispute between painters and gilders.\r\n      A recorded case was settled as follows: \"We judge it just\r\n      to permit the gilder to use colour, and the painter to use\r\n      gilding, when the one or the other plays a subordinate part in\r\n      the finished work. A decision in the opposite sense would seem\r\n      to us hard; for it would be inconvenient to decree that a work\r\n      which can be done by one, must be done by two. Thus, though\r\n      each litigant loses, each is compensated for his loss. The\r\n      profession of the gilder is gilding, but painting is permitted\r\n      as an accessory. In like manner painting is the profession of\r\n      the painter, but gilding is permitted as an accessory.\" In\r\n      this picture, St. Peter's key is, it will be seen, embossed\r\n      in goldsmiths' fashion, and Bartolommeo's picture has a gold\r\n      background. Antonio Vivarini first worked in partnership with\r\n      a certain Zuan (Giovanni), who appears to have been a German\r\n      by birth, and the visitor will notice between the work of the\r\n      early Venetian School a certain affinity with the contemporary\r\n      German work of the Cologne School. After 1450 the name of\r\n      Johannes the German disappears from the inscriptions on\r\n      Vivarini altar-pieces, and that of Bartolommeo takes its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n769. ST. MICHAEL AND THE DRAGON.\r\n\r\n  (_Umbrian_: 1416-1492). _See 665._\r\n\r\n      Formerly ascribed to Fra Carnovale (Bartolommeo Corradini); but\r\n      between Piero della Francesca's angels in 908 and the figure of\r\n      St. Michael here there is a close resemblance, which seems to\r\n      identify the picture as his.\r\n\r\nSt. Michael, the angel of war against the dragon of sin, stands\r\ntriumphant over his foe--emblem of the final triumph of the spiritual\r\nover the animal and earthly part of our nature. It is the most\r\nuniversal of all symbols. The victor is different in different ages,\r\nbut the enemy is always the same crawling reptile. Christian art, from\r\nits earliest times, has thus interpreted the text, \"The dragon shalt\r\nthou trample under feet\" (Psalm xci. 13); and in illustrations of\r\nHindoo mythology Vishnu suffering is folded in the coils of a serpent,\r\nwhilst Vishnu triumphant stands like St. Michael, with his foot upon\r\nthe defeated monster.\r\n\r\n\r\n770. LEONELLO D'ESTE.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Oriolo_ (Ferrarese: painted about 1450).\r\n\r\n      Of Oriolo nothing is known. He was probably by birth a\r\n      Ferrarese, and was evidently a pupil of Pisano (see 776).\r\n\r\nLeonello (of whom also there is a medallion portrait in the frame of\r\nthe picture just referred to), of the house of Este, was Marquis of\r\nFerrara, 1441-1450. His mild and kindly face agrees well with what is\r\nknown of his life. The one important action of his reign was that of a\r\npeacemaker, when he mediated between Venice and the King of Anjou. \"He\r\nhad not his equal,\" says Muratori, \"in piety towards God, in equity and\r\nkindness towards his subjects. He was the protector of men of letters\r\nand was himself a good Latin scholar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n771. ST. JEROME IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n  _Bono_ (Ferrarese: painted about 1450).\r\n\r\n      In the signature of this picture, \"Bono of Ferrara\" announces\r\n      himself \"a pupil of Pisano's,\" and the figure of St. Jerome\r\n      here much resembles Pisano's \"St. Anthony\" (776). Bono's other\r\n      known work is a fresco of St. Christopher in the Eremitani\r\n      Chapel at Padua. \"A clumsy and inferior master,\" says Morelli\r\n      (_German Galleries_, p. 11 _n._); \"an excellent painter,\" says\r\n      Sir F. Burton. His style is, at any rate, precise and effective.\r\n\r\nSt. Jerome (for whom see 773 and 227) is in the desert, deep in\r\nthought; his lion couched at his feet keeps his master's thoughts\r\ncompany as faithfully as a scholar's dog. The desert is here shown as\r\nthe saint's study; notice, especially, the little table that the rock\r\nmakes behind him for his books. Ruskin says of a similar modification\r\nof accessories to express supernatural character, in Bellini's \"St.\r\nJerome\" at Venice: \"The Saint sits upon a rock, his grand form defined\r\nagainst clear green open sky; he is reading; a noble tree springs out\r\nof a cleft in the rock, bends itself suddenly back to form a rest\r\nfor the volume, then shoots up into the sky. There is something very\r\nbeautiful in this obedient ministry of the lower creature; but be it\r\nobserved that the sweet feeling of the whole depends upon the service\r\nbeing such as is consistent with its nature. It is not animated,\r\nit does not _listen_ to the saint, not bend itself towards him as\r\nif in affection; this would have been mere fancy, illegitimate and\r\neffectless. But the simple bend of the trunk to receive the book is\r\nmiraculous subjection of the true nature of the tree; it is therefore\r\nimaginative, and very touching\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. ii. pt. iii.\r\nsec. ii. ch. v. § 8).\r\n\r\n\r\n772. MADONNA AND CHILD ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n  _Cosimo Tura_ (Ferrarese: 1420-1495).\r\n\r\n      Cosimo Tura (pronounced Cosmè in Ferrarese) is the first\r\n      Ferrarese painter of eminence and of native talent whose\r\n      works have come down to us. He was a well-to-do citizen, and,\r\n      like Titian after him, dealt in timber. As an artist he was\r\n      in the service of Duke Borso of Ferrara (whose portrait is\r\n      introduced in the background of No. 773), and other members\r\n      of the princely house of Este. The court of Ferrara was then\r\n      one of the most learned of Italy. A curious instance occurs in\r\n      this picture, where, on either side of the Virgin's throne,\r\n      are inscribed the Commandments, in Hebrew characters. Such\r\n      inscriptions are common in Ferrarese pictures, and point to\r\n      the presence of some Hebrew scholar or scholars. It was at\r\n      this court that Cosimo came under the influence of Flemish\r\n      art as described below, for the house of Este (which was of\r\n      Lombard origin, and thus had a natural affinity perhaps for\r\n      northern art) had invited Roger van der Weyden to Ferrara. Tura\r\n      was \"first employed by the Duke of Ferrara in 1451. Between\r\n      1452 and 1456 his whereabouts are uncertain. Possibly he was\r\n      then in Padua among the followers of Squarcione, or else in\r\n      Venice, to the poor of which city he left by will part of the\r\n      fruits of his long and industrious life. In 1458 he rose to\r\n      a fixed appointment in the Ducal service. He made a fortune,\r\n      risked it in trade, and died a wealthy man\" (Catalogue of the\r\n      Burlington Fine Arts Club's Exhibition, 1894, p. xv.). Some\r\n      of his works are to be seen at Ferrara, others are in the\r\n      Berlin Gallery, at Bergamo, and the Correr Museum at Venice.\r\n      He is one of the most unmistakable and least fascinating, yet\r\n      most interesting of painters. Of beauty or grace in the human\r\n      figure he had no perception. His colour schemes are peculiar,\r\n      and harmonious rather than beautiful. But he had sincerity\r\n      of purpose and vigour of manipulation. Where his subjects\r\n      lend themselves to strength, he is impressive, as in the \"St.\r\n      Jerome\" (773), but his Madonnas (772 and 905) are both affected\r\n      and ugly. His patience in the execution of detail, and quaint\r\n      if superabundant ornament, are always interesting. The picture\r\n      now before us is thoroughly characteristic of a master who\r\n      alternately repels and attracts.\r\n\r\nThe decorative detail here deserves close attention. Compare, for\r\ninstance, the ornament of the pilasters here with that of the pilasters\r\nin Crivelli's \"Annunciation\" (739), which was painted about the same\r\ntime. \"Crivelli follows the traditional lines common to all such\r\nfeatures from later Roman times downwards, while Tura's accessories\r\nare full of inventiveness and are evidently designed for this especial\r\npicture. Thus the cup, balls, and wing-like appendages in the pilaster\r\nare quite original. The general scheme of colour in the picture, also,\r\nwith its contrasts of red and green, is quite apart from anything\r\nexisting in contemporary Italian art, and recalls rather a Flemish\r\nstained-glass window of the fifteenth century\" (G. T. Robinson in _Art\r\nJournal_, May 1886, pp. 149, 150). The musical instruments are also\r\nworth notice. \"One of the angels, on the left, holds an ornamental\r\nviol, having five strings, with a carved man's head; another angel, on\r\nthe right, holds a similar viol, with a carved woman's head. In the\r\ncentre is placed a positive organ--that is, a small organ not intended\r\nfor removal. The player is on the left, in front of the organ; the\r\nblower is on the right, behind it. Only natural keys are visible, but\r\nthere are three stops to be drawn out from the side, in the primitive\r\nway, by means of cords attached to them, to control the pipes, of which\r\nthirty are visible and three are drones. These pipes are grouped in\r\ncolumnar disposition, like an hour-glass, and not in the order of ranks\r\nusual with small organs. It is noticeable that the player uses both\r\nhands, held nearly in the modern position\" (A. J. Hipkins in _The Hobby\r\nHorse_, No. i. p. 19).\r\n\r\n\r\n773. ST. JEROME IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n  _Cosimo Tura_ (Ferrarese: 1420-1495). _See 772._\r\n\r\n        Jerome knocking at his poor old breast\r\n    With his great round stone to subdue the flesh--\r\n\r\nand schooling himself into renunciation of the world, the flesh, and\r\nthe devil. In contrast to the wildness of the surroundings, the painter\r\nintroduces quite a company of birds and beasts--an owl sits in sedate\r\nwisdom above the saint, his familiar lion is walking to the stream for\r\nwater, and in the crannies and ledges are other animals to keep him\r\ncompany. For it was his union of gentleness and refinement with noble\r\ncontinence, his love and imagination winning even savage beasts into\r\ndomestic friends, that distinguished St. Jerome and formed the true\r\nmonastic ideal (see 227).\r\n\r\n\r\n774. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish School: 15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nOn the Madonna's right is St. Peter; on her left St. Paul, an\r\narrangement common in early art, St. Peter and St. Paul being the two\r\nchief apostles on whom the Church of Christ is built. St. Paul offers\r\na pink to the infant Christ. Flowers were consecrated to the Virgin,\r\nand the early painters chose those they liked best to be emblems of\r\nlove and beauty. Notice the design on the stuff fixed at the back of\r\nthe Madonna's throne; it is a beautiful example of the ornamental work\r\nof the time in northern Europe. The picture was formerly ascribed to\r\nVan der Goes--an artist whose only certainly known picture is the\r\naltar-piece in the hospital of S. Maria Nuova in Florence,--and is by\r\nsome ascribed to Bouts (see under 783).\r\n\r\n\r\n775. AN OLD LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See 45._\r\n\r\nAn old lady, eighty-three years of age (as the inscription shows). This\r\nsplendid portrait is dated 1634, and was made therefore when Rembrandt\r\nwas twenty-eight. His mother was from the first a favourite sitter of\r\nhis, and hence, perhaps, the affectionate fidelity with which he always\r\npainted the wrinkled faces of old age. In the British Museum there is\r\nan Indian-ink copy of this portrait, from which it appears that the\r\nlady's name was Françoise van Wasserhoven. Rembrandt, says M. Michel,\r\n\"is most individual and moving in those portraits of old women, in\r\nwhich by the accidents of form and feature he so admirably suggests the\r\nmoral life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n776. ST. ANTHONY AND ST. GEORGE.\r\n\r\n  _Vittore Pisano_ (Veronese: 1380-1452).\r\n\r\n      The earliest picture of the Veronese School in the Gallery. \"No\r\n      school of painting in Italy except the Florentine shows,\" says\r\n      Morelli, \"so regular and uninterrupted a development, from the\r\n      thirteenth to the seventeenth century, as the graceful school\r\n      of Verona. If we look, for example, at some of the oldest\r\n      frescoes at St. Zeno, at the frescoes of the great Pisanello\r\n      in S. Anastasia of the first half of the fifteenth century, at\r\n      the pictures of Liberale (1134 and 1336) and Domenico Morone\r\n      (1211), and of their pupils Francesco Morone (285), Girolamo\r\n      dai Libri (748), Michele da Verona (1214), Giolfino (749),\r\n      and Morando (735 and 769), and then to Paolo Veronese and his\r\n      followers, we find everywhere the same cheerful and graceful\r\n      character looking out of each of these works of the Veronese\r\n      School. The Veronese do not penetrate so deep into the essence\r\n      of art as the Venetians, but they are, with few exceptions,\r\n      more gracious and serene. And to this day the population of\r\n      this beautifully situated town is reckoned the cheeriest\r\n      and gayest in all Italy: _Veronesi, mezzo natti_\" (_German\r\n      Galleries_, p. 395). In the National Gallery the development\r\n      of the Veronese School may, as will be seen from the\r\n      references inserted above, be well studied. The importance and\r\n      independence of the Veronese painters are shown by the career\r\n      of Vittore Pisano, commonly called by the endearing diminutive\r\n      Pisanello. He was born at St. Vigilio, near the Lake of Garda,\r\n      and was probably a pupil of Altichiero, an older master of the\r\n      Veronese School, and was famous as the inventor of a method of\r\n      casting medals; but though better known now as a medallist, in\r\n      his own day he was equally famous as a painter. In the frame of\r\n      this picture are inserted casts from two of his medals, and it\r\n      will be noticed that the lower one--a profile of himself--is\r\n      inscribed Pisanus Pictor; Pisano the Painter. The medal above\r\n      is that of Leonello d'Este, his patron, for whom this picture\r\n      was probably painted, and whose portrait by a pupil of Pisano\r\n      is in our Gallery (770). At Bergamo is a portrait of Leonello\r\n      by Pisano himself (reproduced in the Illustrated Catalogue of\r\n      the Morelli Gallery by Signor Frizzoni). Another evidence of\r\n      Pisano's practice as a medallist will be noticed in the gilt\r\n      embossed work of St. George's sword and spurs. Leonello wrote\r\n      of Pisano as \"the most illustrious of all the painters of\r\n      this age,\" and contemporary writers similarly extol his fame.\r\n      In 1421 he was summoned to Venice. \"When, in the beginning\r\n      of the fifteenth century, great monumental works in painting\r\n      were to be carried out at Venice, the local school was still\r\n      so insignificant that no native artist could be entrusted\r\n      with the commission. They were obliged to summon Vittore\r\n      Pisano, notwithstanding that he had once been on the list of\r\n      the politically obnoxious, and as such was liable to penal\r\n      consequences\" (Richter). Pisano was accompanied by Gentile da\r\n      Fabriano. \"The presence of those two eminent artists in the\r\n      city of the Lagoons gave,\" says Morelli, \"a new impulse to\r\n      its school of painting. Jacopo Bellini became a scholar of\r\n      Gentile, and when his master had finished his work at Venice he\r\n      accompanied him to Florence. During the few years of their stay\r\n      at Venice, Gentile and Pisanello must not only have instructed\r\n      Bellini in their art, but their influence on Antonio Vivarini\r\n      of Murano also seems to me undeniable.... Taking him all in\r\n      all, I consider that Giovanni Bellini was the greatest painter\r\n      in North Italy in the fifteenth century, though undoubtedly\r\n      Pisano was in the first half of the century as great a painter\r\n      as was Bellini in the second half\" (_German Galleries_, p.\r\n      357; _Roman Galleries_, p. 267). Of Pisano's wall-paintings\r\n      in the Doge's Palace, in that of the Pope, and in the castles\r\n      of the foremost princes of the century, no traces remain. His\r\n      fresco of \"St. George mounting for the fight\" may be seen\r\n      in the church of St. Anastasia at Verona. Among his very\r\n      rare easel-pictures the one now before us is signed and very\r\n      original in conception; No. 1436 is the most important, and\r\n      is especially interesting as illustrating Pisano's love of\r\n      representing animals, and the high reputation he enjoyed for\r\n      his skill in doing so. \"Vittore lived,\" says Sir F. Burton,\r\n      \"at a time when the traditions and forms of chivalry had not\r\n      yet died out; and all his works, including his delicate and\r\n      spirited pen-drawings in the Louvre, have a certain stamp of\r\n      knightly grace which is singularly attractive: in this respect\r\n      they resemble the creations of Gentile da Fabriano.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of the picture--a meeting between St. George and St.\r\nAnthony, with a vision of the Virgin and Child above--is not to be\r\nfound in the legends of the saints, and Pisano's conception is quite\r\noriginal. St. George appears to have been a favourite subject with the\r\nartist--probably because of the way in which his armour lent itself to\r\nmedallion-like treatment. There is a good instance of frank anachronism\r\nin the large Tuscan hat of Pisano's own day which he quaintly makes St.\r\nGeorge wear, \"according to the everyday custom of the Italian noblemen\r\nat their country-seats in the summer.\"[181] Perhaps too the painter\r\nchose St. George partly because he involved a horse and a dragon, and\r\nPisano, says Vasari, \"took especial pleasure in the delineation of\r\nanimals.\" This may have given him a weakness for the boar of good St.\r\nAnthony--the hermit saint whose temptations have passed into a proverb.\r\nThe saint carries a bell, for \"it is said that the wicked spirits that\r\nbe in the region of the air fear much when they hear the bells ringen,\"\r\nand a staff, another means of exorcising the devil; whilst the boar,\r\nnow tamed into service, is symbolical of the demon of sensuality which\r\nSt. Anthony vanquished. And here perhaps we find the clue to the idea\r\nin the picture. For the dragon whom St. George slew represents the\r\nsame sensual enemy. St. George conquered by fighting, St. Anthony by\r\nfasting. The two saints now meet when \"each on his course alone\" has\r\n\"worked out each a way.\" The old man, whose life has been spent in\r\nstruggle, greets the triumphant youth with curious surprise; and St.\r\nGeorge too, with the thoughtful look on his face, will have much to\r\nsay and learn. But over them both, as to all who overcome, the heavens\r\nopen in beatific vision; for though there be diversity of gifts, it\r\nis the same spirit. The signature of the painter (Pisanus pinxit) is\r\nfantastically traced by herbage in the foreground.\r\n\r\n\r\n777. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Morando_ (Veronese: 1486-1522). _See 735._\r\n\r\nA picture of great beauty, which goes far to justify the title of\r\n\"the Raphael of the Veronese School\" by which Morando has been\r\ndistinguished. Every visitor will be struck by the unpretentious\r\nsimplicity of conception, the rich colours and the sweet faces--with\r\njust a dash of Raphaelesque affectation. It is interesting to note that\r\nMorando was almost exactly contemporary with Raphael, while his art\r\nexhibits a maturity developed under totally different circumstances.\r\nFor Morando never left Verona, and was thus, says Sir F. Burton, \"a\r\npure growth of the native Veronese School. His colouring, though often\r\nbrilliant, is rather cold; the pale flesh-tints, glossy in surface, are\r\nshadowed with grey, and even the lake reds introduced in garments tend\r\ntowards that purplish hue which the best colourists avoid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n778. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Martino da Udine_ (Venetian: 1470-1547).\r\n\r\n      Martino of Udine was called also Pellegrino of San Daniele (a\r\n      village near the former place). According to Vasari, he was a\r\n      pupil of Giovanni Bellini, who, astonished at the marvellous\r\n      progress of his pupil, gave him the name of Pellegrino--that\r\n      is, rare, extraordinary. More probably, however, it should\r\n      be interpreted merely as a stranger or foreigner at Udine,\r\n      Martino being of Dalmatian origin (see for a full account and\r\n      discussion of this painter Morelli's _German Galleries_, pp.\r\n      18-23). He was, says Sir F. Burton, \"one of those men who,\r\n      with little native genius, have yet the capacity of absorbing\r\n      material from others, and of working it into new forms with\r\n      success. Thus Pellegrino turned out some works which, while\r\n      they carry the foreign stamp of Giorgione, Titian, Pordenone,\r\n      or other great contemporaries, nevertheless show considerable\r\n      freshness of conception and treatment.\" His altar-piece, of\r\n      1494, in the church of Osopo, shows the influence of Cima da\r\n      Conegliano. From 1504 to 1512 he was frequently at Ferrara\r\n      working for the Duke Alfonso. In 1519-1521 he painted a part\r\n      of the choir of S. Antonio at S. Daniele (the earlier part\r\n      was painted in 1497); in this, his best work, he appears as\r\n      an imitator not only of Pordenone but of Romanino. In 1526 he\r\n      went, apparently for the first time, to Venice, there to buy\r\n      colours for a large picture which he had engaged to paint for\r\n      the church of Cividale: that picture shows his study of Palma.\r\n      Pellegrino combined with painting the business of a timber\r\n      merchant. \"That so mediocre a painter as Pellegrino should have\r\n      attained high honour in Friuli need,\" says Morelli, \"surprise\r\n      no one who knows the other painters of that little country.\r\n      The value of anything in the world is comparative. The Friulan\r\n      race never manifested the same talent for art as, for instance,\r\n      their neighbours of Treviso.\"\r\n\r\nOn the right of the throne is St. James, with his hand on the shoulder\r\nof the donor of the picture; on the left St. George, with the dead\r\ndragon at his horse's feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n779, 780. FAMILY PORTRAITS.[182]\r\n\r\n  _Borgognone_ (Lombard: about 1455-1523). _See 298._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nOn the left (779) a group of nine men, above them a hand, probably\r\nof some patron saint; on the right (780) a group of thirteen women,\r\nkneeling (apparently) by the side of a tomb--studies of character\r\ndrawing. These pictures are painted on silk (now attached to wood),\r\nand were originally part of a standard. Mr. Pater says of Borgognone\r\nthat \"a northern temper is a marked element of his genius--something of\r\nthe _patience_, especially, of the masters of Dijon or Bruges, nowhere\r\nmore clearly [seen] than in the two groups of male and female heads\r\nin the National Gallery, family groups, painted in the attitude of\r\nworship, with a lowly religious sincerity which may remind us of the\r\ncontemporary work of M. Legros. Like those northern masters, he accepts\r\npiously, but can refine, what 'has no comeliness'\" (\"Art Notes in North\r\nItaly,\" in the _New Review_, November 1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n781. RAPHAEL AND TOBIAS.\r\n\r\n  _Florentine School_ (15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew legend of Tobit and his son Tobias (told in the Book of\r\nTobit in the Apocrypha) was a favourite one with the Mediæval Church,\r\nand became therefore a traditional subject for painting; see _e.g._\r\nin the National Gallery, 288, 72, and 48. Tobit, a Jewish exile,\r\nhaving fallen also into poverty, and afterwards becoming blind, prays\r\nfor death rather than life in noble despair. \"To him the angel of\r\nall beautiful life (Raphael) is sent, hidden in simplicity of human\r\nduty, taking a servant's place for hire, to lead his son in all right\r\nand happy ways of life\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1877, p. 31). Here we see\r\nRaphael leading the young Tobias into Media, where he was to marry\r\nSara, his rich kinswoman, the daughter of Raguel. But she was haunted\r\nby an evil spirit, who had slain her seven husbands, each on their\r\nwedding-day, and the angel bade Tobias take the gall of a certain fish,\r\nwherewith afterwards to heal his father's blindness, and its heart and\r\nliver wherewith to drive away the evil spirit from his bride. Tobias is\r\ncarrying the fish, Raphael has a small box for the gall. The \"rising\r\nstep\" and the \"springy motion in his gait\" are characteristic of him\r\nwho was the messenger of heaven, the kindly companion of humanity--\r\n\r\n    Raphael, the sociable spirit, that deigned\r\n    To travel with Tobias, and secured\r\n    His marriage with the seven times wedded maid.\r\n\r\n  MILTON: _Paradise Lost_, v. 221.\r\n\r\nFor the authorship of this picture, see under 296. \"This picture,\" says\r\na critic who gives both to Verrocchio, \"may possibly be not entirely\r\nfrom his hand, but there is no doubt that it is essentially his,\r\nand that to his fancy for painting boyhood and opening youth we owe\r\nthat curious misreading of the story of Tobias, representing him as\r\na young lad instead of a grown man, which is to be found through all\r\nthe numerous Florentine picture of him by the school of Botticelli, by\r\nPiero di Cosimo and the rest\" (_Times_, October 26, 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n782. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510). _See under 1034._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nProbably only a \"school picture.\" Most of the old masters kept schools,\r\nor shops, in which several pupils served as apprentices and worked at\r\npictures under the master's directions. The sale of such pictures under\r\nthe master's name was (and is) a very common occurrence, and even in\r\nthose days forged signatures were not unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n783. THE EXHUMATION OF BISHOP HUBERT.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n\r\n      This beautiful work was formerly in the collection of Mr.\r\n      Beckford at Fonthill, where it was described as the Burial of a\r\n      Bishop by Jan Van Eyck. It has also been ascribed to Gerard Van\r\n      der Meire (see 1078) and to Thierri Bouts (about 1420-1475).\r\n      This latter painter--called by early authors Thierry, or Dierik\r\n      of Haarlem, from the name of his native town, and by modern\r\n      writers Thierri Stuerbout,--was town's painter of Louvain, and\r\n      a pupil probably of Roger van der Weyden. His principal works\r\n      are now in the Brussels Museum. Other pictures in the Gallery\r\n      attributed to him by some critics are 664, 774, and 943. Van\r\n      der Meire, Justus of Ghent, and Albert Van Ouwater have also\r\n      been suggested as the painters of this picture; it closely\r\n      resembles the \"Raising of Lazarus\" ascribed to the last-named\r\n      painter in the Berlin Gallery.\r\n\r\nSt. Hubert was originally a nobleman of Aquitaine, much addicted to\r\nall worldly pleasures, and especially to that of the chase. But one\r\nday in Holy Week, when all good Christians were at their devotions, as\r\nhe was hunting in the forest of Ardennes, he encountered a milk-white\r\nstag bearing the crucifix between his horns. Filled with awe and\r\nastonishment, he renounced the pomps and vanities of the world, turned\r\nhermit in that very forest of Ardennes, was ordained, and became\r\nBishop of Liège. So the legend runs, embalming, we may suppose, the\r\nconversion of some reckless lover of the chase, like the wild huntsman\r\nof the German legend. And at Liège he was buried, but thirteen years\r\nafterwards his body was disinterred, and lo! it was found entire; even\r\nthe episcopal robes in which he had been interred were without spot or\r\nstain. A century later the body was removed from Liège and reinterred\r\nin the abbey church of the Benedictine monks of Ardennes. The Emperor\r\nLouis le Débonnaire assisted at the translation of the relics, and\r\nthe day was long kept as a festival throughout this part of Flanders.\r\nThis is the subject of the present picture, of which the scene is laid\r\nin the choir of a beautiful Gothic church. On the altar behind the\r\nprincipal group stands a shrine, on which is a little figure of St.\r\nHubert with his hunting-horn. The royal personage assisting represents\r\nLouis le Débonnaire. The picture is of wonderful beauty, finished in\r\nevery part (abridged from Mrs. Jameson: _Sacred and Legendary Art_,\r\npp. 431, 432). Though it is thus an historical picture, the artist\r\ntakes the figures from his own time, and the heads, like miniatures\r\nin character and delicacy of expression, are doubtless portraits--the\r\nwhole scene being a picture of a Flemish Cathedral on some festival\r\nday. Notice, as a particularly interesting little piece of life, the\r\nman flattening his nose against the screen on the left, with a jeering\r\nexpression, as if he \"didn't half believe it all.\" It is a piece of\r\nliving grotesque, exactly such as meets one in the sculptured stones\r\nof a mediæval cathedral itself--\"peeping round the corner at you and\r\nlurking in secret places, like a monk's joke whispered in church\"\r\n(Conway's _Early Flemish Artists_, p. 17).\r\n\r\n\r\n788. AN ALTAR-PIECE.\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Crivelli_ (Venetian: painted 1468-1493). _See_ 602.\r\n\r\nThis important picture is one of Crivelli's masterpieces and is very\r\ncharacteristic of his genius and its limitations. The work, it will be\r\nseen, is not so much a picture as a collection of panel pictures built\r\nup into a gorgeous piece of decoration. The panels in the two lower\r\ntiers were painted for the old church of San Domenico, at Ascoli; the\r\ncentral panel of the Madonna and Child is inscribed with the painter's\r\nname and the date 1476. The church was rebuilt in 1776, and some years\r\nafterwards the picture came into the possession of Cardinal Zelada at\r\nRome, who added the four upper pictures by the same painter. In 1852\r\nthe picture passed to Prince Anatole de Demidoff, at Florence, where it\r\nwas put into its present magnificent frame. Crivelli's artistic aim, it\r\nhas been said, was the development and perfection of isolated figures\r\nfor elaborate altar-pieces of this kind, and those before us are among\r\nthe best he ever did: \"in them calm dignity, strength of character,\r\ngentleness, and grace, can all be treated by him with perfect success\r\napart from the disturbing elements of emotion and action.\" The type of\r\nthe Virgin here is very characteristic, with her high-arched eyebrows,\r\nsmall mouth, and hair tightly drawn back from the forehead. So too\r\nare the hands, with very long fingers, in which affectation borders\r\non dislocation. Very natural, on the contrary, is the figure of the\r\ninfant Christ, \"fast asleep with one hand under his head while with the\r\nother he grasps his mother's middle finger--a picture drawn from the\r\nlife.\" The decorative details are characteristic. Note the dolphins\r\non the base of the throne. The festoons are meant to represent real\r\nofferings of fruit, tied with string and fastened with nails. On one\r\nside of the Virgin is St. Peter, an impressive figure: his costume\r\nshows the use of raised ornaments and imitation gems, which is common\r\nin Crivelli's earlier works, but which he gradually dropped. Beyond St.\r\nPeter is St. John the Baptist in the wilderness: the hard and severe\r\nstyle of the figure is remarkable. \"The landscape in which he stands\r\nshould not be passed over, with the stream flowing at his feet and the\r\ntree-stems broken off so as not to interfere with the gold background\r\nwhich sets off the upper half of the figure.\" On the other side of the\r\nVirgin is St. Catherine of Alexandria, and beyond her St. Dominic--a\r\nfigure \"admirable in its expression of piety and humility and in the\r\npersonality with which Crivelli has invested it.\" The half-length\r\nfigures in the second tier are St. Francis, with the stigmata; St.\r\nAndrew, with cross and book--a very grand head; St. Stephen, with the\r\nstones of his martyrdom; and St. Thomas Aquinas, with book and the\r\nmodel of a church. In the top tier are St. Jerome, also carrying the\r\nmodel of a church; the Archangel Michael, trampling on the dragon and\r\nweighing in a pair of scales a man and a woman who are of light weight;\r\nSt. Peter Martyr, with the sword of his martyrdom, and St. Lucy,\r\ncarrying a plate with eyes upon it. The reference is to the legend\r\nwhich relates that in order to discourage the suit of a youth who loved\r\nher for the beauty of her eyes, she plucked them out with her own hands\r\nand sent them to him in a dish. The youth, struck with remorse, became\r\na Christian, and Lucy's sight was miraculously restored to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n790. THE ENTOMBMENT OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Michael Angelo_ (Florentine: 1475-1564).\r\n\r\n      Michelangelo (commonly anglicised as above) Buonarroti (which\r\n      surname, however, is commonly dropped) is the Titan of Italian\r\n      art. He was the rival of Raphael; and amongst the artists who\r\n      were present at the unveiling of his great statue of David were\r\n      Perugino, Botticelli, Lorenzo di Credi, Leonardo da Vinci,\r\n      and Filippino Lippi. He lived through the fall of Rome and\r\n      Florence, and survived into the decadence of Italian art. In\r\n      the many-sidedness of his genius he may be compared to Leonardo\r\n      da Vinci. He was at once painter, sculptor, architect, and man\r\n      of action. The greatness of his work was reflected in that of\r\n      his character. He passed most of his life at Rome, amidst the\r\n      petty intrigues of a debased Court; but he never placed his\r\n      self-respect in jeopardy. Filial duty, too, was one of the\r\n      mainsprings of his life. He lived most sparingly, and sent\r\n      all the money he could save to support his father's family at\r\n      Florence. \"Whence they must pray God,\" he says in one of his\r\n      letters, \"that all his works may have good success.\" He was\r\n      proud, and would brook no insult; and when Pope Julius left\r\n      him with unpaid marbles and workmen on his hands, he mounted\r\n      his horse and rode off to Florence. There are many stories,\r\n      too, of the quiet sarcasm with which he would \"reproach men for\r\n      sin.\" \"What does the raised hand denote?\" Julius asked of a\r\n      statue of himself. \"You are advising the people of Bologna to\r\n      be wise,\" was Michelangelo's reply. With all this, however, he\r\n      was for the most part above the jealousy of other artists. When\r\n      commissioned to paint the Sixtine Chapel, he urged that Raphael\r\n      would be a more fit person to execute so great a work; and when\r\n      he was appointed architect of St. Peter's he refused to permit\r\n      any material alteration of Bramante's design, though Bramante\r\n      had perpetually intrigued against him. Michelangelo was a poet\r\n      also (his sonnets have been translated by J. A. Symonds), his\r\n      poetry being partly inspired by Vittoria Colonna, widow of the\r\n      Marquis of Pescara, to whom late in life he became attached,\r\n      and whose friendship, until her death in 1547, was the solace\r\n      of his lonely labours.\r\n\r\n      It is only in Florence and in Rome that the work of\r\n      Michelangelo can be studied. Our Gallery is fortunate, however,\r\n      in having two easel pictures, which, whether entirely from\r\n      his own hand or not, are eminently characteristic of his\r\n      style. The South Kensington Museum and the Royal Academy each\r\n      possess one example of his sculpture. His drawings are to be\r\n      seen in several English collections, especially in that of the\r\n      University of Oxford. A concise chronological summary may here\r\n      be useful to recall to the reader's recollection the chief\r\n      works of the master. At the age of thirteen he was apprenticed\r\n      for three years to Domenico Ghirlandaio to whom our picture,\r\n      No. 809, was formerly ascribed. He made rapid advance in the\r\n      art of painting, and showed also aptitude for sculpture; so\r\n      that in 1489, before his apprenticeship was out, Domenico\r\n      recommended him to Lorenzo de' Medici, who had founded a school\r\n      of sculpture in the garden of his villa. Here, in the society\r\n      and service of Lorenzo, Michelangelo remained for four years.\r\n      Lorenzo's unworthy successor Piero employed the young artist\r\n      only on unworthy commissions, setting him on one occasion, it\r\n      is said, to make a statue of snow; a tradition which inspires a\r\n      noble passage in Ruskin's _Political Economy of Art_, as also\r\n      in Mrs. Browning's _Casa Guidi Windows_. In 1493 Michelangelo\r\n      removed to Bologna, returning in the next year to Florence,\r\n      where he produced a \"Sleeping Cupid,\" which was sold in Rome\r\n      as a veritable antique. This induced him, in 1496, to try his\r\n      fortune in the Papal capital. To this period belong his statue\r\n      of \"Cupid,\" now at South Kensington, the \"Bacchus\" in the\r\n      Bargello at Florence, and the noble \"Pietà\" in St. Peter's at\r\n      Rome. By these works he attained the position of the greatest\r\n      sculptor in Italy, and on his return to Florence in 1501 he\r\n      executed the colossal statue of \"David,\" now in the Accademia.\r\n      Works of about the same time are the round marble relief in the\r\n      possession of the Royal Academy, and our picture No. 809. The\r\n      circular \"Madonna and Child,\" now in the Uffizi, belongs to\r\n      1504. In the same year he received a commission to paint one\r\n      wall of the Palazzo Vecchio. The painting was never executed;\r\n      but Michelangelo's cartoon for it,--known as the \"Cartoon\r\n      of Pisa\"--excited great admiration for its treatment of the\r\n      human figure. In 1505 began Michelangelo's stormy relations\r\n      with the imperious Pope, Julius II. For two years he was\r\n      employed on a great bronze statue of the Pontiff, which was\r\n      afterwards cast as a cannon and used against the Pope by the\r\n      Bolognese. In 1508, being then thirty-three, Michelangelo was\r\n      commissioned by Julius to paint the ceiling of the Sixtine\r\n      Chapel. In this great work, which was finished on November 1,\r\n      1512, the artist set forth, in the vehicle of the human form,\r\n      his conception of the creation, and the early history of the\r\n      world, with reference to man's final redemption and salvation.\r\n      The frescoes have in our time been admirably photographed, and\r\n      the figures of the Prophets and Sibyls, who sit enthroned in\r\n      niches round the vault, are very widely known. The paintings\r\n      caused Michelangelo to suspend his labour on the mausoleum\r\n      of Julius--a work which gave him an infinity of labour and\r\n      vexation, and which was never finished. The great figure of\r\n      \"Moses,\" now in S. Pietro in Vincoli, and the \"Captives,\" in\r\n      the Louvre, were designed for this monument. During the nine\r\n      years' pontificate of Leo X. (1513-22), Michelangelo was mostly\r\n      employed in the unworthy occupation of procuring marble from\r\n      the quarries of Pietra Santa for the façade of the church\r\n      of San Lorenzo at Florence. The short reign of Adrian VI.\r\n      succeeded, and Michelangelo went on working for a time at the\r\n      monument to Julius. He was also employed on the works of the\r\n      Medici Chapel at Florence. In 1523 when Clement VII. succeeded,\r\n      the artist was put to various architectural works. Stormy years\r\n      followed, and Michelangelo quitted the Medici statues to defend\r\n      his native city. He was appointed director of fortifications,\r\n      and was entrusted also with diplomatic missions. When in 1530\r\n      Florence was treacherously yielded to the Medici, Michelangelo\r\n      lay for some time in concealment. Clement, however, gave him\r\n      his pardon, and ordered him to resume work on the Medici\r\n      chapel in San Lorenzo. He worked, as he says, with \"morbid\r\n      haste\" but saddened heart, and thus were completed his most\r\n      impressive productions in sculpture--the four great recumbent\r\n      figures for the tombs of Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici. In\r\n      1534 Clement died. Michelangelo flung down his mallet, and\r\n      set foot in Florence no more. But \"a new Eurystheus arose for\r\n      our Hercules.\" The artist hoped to complete the mausoleum of\r\n      Julius. But the new Pope, Paul III., set him to work upon\r\n      the fresco of the Last Judgment, on the altar wall of the\r\n      Sixtine Chapel. In this mighty work, containing 314 figures,\r\n      which occupied him from 1534 to 1542, the painter \"devoted\r\n      his terrible genius to a subject worthy of the times in which\r\n      he lived.\" Since he had first listened, while a youth, to the\r\n      prophecies of Savonarola, the woes announced in that apocalypse\r\n      had all come true. To Michelangelo, Christ came as an avenger,\r\n      vindictive and implacable, and the lost souls fall before his\r\n      wrath in every contortion of nudity. After the painting of\r\n      the \"Last Judgment,\" one more great labour was reserved for\r\n      Michelangelo. He was called upon to succeed Antonio da San\r\n      Gallo as architect of St. Peter's, a post which he continued to\r\n      hold under succeeding Popes until his death. \"The dome of St.\r\n      Peter's, as seen from Tivoli or the Alban hills, like a cloud\r\n      upon the Campagna, is his; but he has no share in the façade\r\n      which screens it from the Piazza.\" His last poem declared the\r\n      vanity of the art which was his glory, and his dying words to\r\n      his household were these; \"In your passage through this life\r\n      remember the sufferings of Jesus Christ.\" His body was taken,\r\n      as he had desired, to Florence, and he lies in Santa Croce.\r\n\r\n      To the artistic genius of Michelangelo, a few out of\r\n      innumerable tributes may here be mentioned. Raphael \"thanked\r\n      God that he was born in the days of Michelangelo,\" and Sir\r\n      Joshua Reynolds says, in his _Discourses_, that \"to kiss the\r\n      hem of his garment, to catch the slightest of his perfections,\r\n      would be glory and distinction enough for an ambitious man.\"\r\n      His knowledge of the human body and his power of representing\r\n      it were supreme. \"If a combination of the most exquisite\r\n      finish in drawing and modelling which allows the work to\r\n      bear the closest inspection in its details, with the utmost\r\n      simplicity, breadth, and clearness of effect in a distant\r\n      view, constitute, as I believe they do, the elements of perfect\r\n      work, I must assert positively,\" says Sir Edward Poynter,\r\n      \"that Michelangelo is the most perfect of workmen.\" This\r\n      workmanship was employed with consummate dramatic effect.\r\n      \"He considered figures the highest means of telling a story;\r\n      he concentrated his powers on the single important point of\r\n      expression, so that he had no need of accessories to help him\r\n      out with his story\" (_Lectures on Art_). But above all the\r\n      work of Michelangelo was the expression of \"a vast imaginative\r\n      gift, the stormy poetry of his mind.\" His works, says Ruskin,\r\n      \"have borne and in themselves retain and exercise the same\r\n      inexplicable power--inexplicable because proceeding from an\r\n      imaginative perception almost superhuman, which goes whither\r\n      we cannot follow, and is where we cannot come; throwing naked\r\n      the final, deepest root of the being of man, whereby he grows\r\n      out of the invisible, and holds on his God home\" (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. ii. \"Of Imagination Penetrative\"). \"About the\r\n      qualities of his genius,\" says Symonds, \"opinions may and will,\r\n      and ought to differ. It is so pronounced, so peculiar, so\r\n      repulsive to one man, so attractive to another, that, like his\r\n      own dread statue of Lorenzo de' Medici, 'it fascinates and is\r\n      intolerable.' There are few, I take it, who can feel at home\r\n      with him in all the length and breadth and dark depths of the\r\n      regions that he traversed. The world of thought and forms in\r\n      which he lived habitually is too arid, like an extinct planet,\r\n      tenanted by mighty elemental beings with little human left to\r\n      them, but visionary Titan-shapes, too vast and void for common\r\n      minds to dwell in pleasurably. The sweetness that emerges\r\n      from his strength, the beauty which blooms rarely, strangely,\r\n      in unhomely wise, upon the awful crowd of his conceptions,\r\n      are only to be apprehended by some innate sympathy or by\r\n      long incubation of the brooding intellect. It is probable,\r\n      therefore, that the deathless artist through long centuries of\r\n      glory will abide as solitary as the simple old man did in his\r\n      poor house at Rome\" (_Life of Michelangelo_, ii. 373). On his\r\n      successors the influence of Michelangelo was not happy. They\r\n      could imitate his mannerisms, but not his manner. They had not\r\n      his imagination, but they could copy the violent attitudes in\r\n      which he clothed his Titanic thoughts. The anatomical studies\r\n      which with him were the groundwork for his imagination to build\r\n      upon became in their hands the final object of their art.\r\n      (Among those who have been alternately fascinated and repelled\r\n      by Michelangelo was Ruskin. His case against Michelangelo\r\n      is contained in the pamphlet entitled _The Relation between\r\n      Michael Angelo and Tintoret_. But some of Ruskin's critics\r\n      forget that the pamphlet was meant to be read in conjunction\r\n      with his own earlier praise in _Modern Painters_, and with\r\n      Mr. Tyrwhitt's appreciation in _Christian Art and Symbolism_.\r\n      \"These lectures,\" said Ruskin, in his preface to that book,\r\n      \"show throughout the most beautiful and just reverence for\r\n      Michael Angelo, and are of especial value in their account\r\n      of him; while the last lecture on sculpture, which I gave at\r\n      Oxford, is entirely devoted to examining the modes in which\r\n      his genius itself failed, and perverted that of other men. But\r\n      Michael Angelo is great enough to make praise and blame alike\r\n      necessary, and alike inadequate\").\r\n\r\nOne of the many unfinished works, which, as Vasari tells us,\r\nMichelangelo left behind him in painting as in sculpture. Its history\r\nis interesting. It was formerly in the gallery of Cardinal Fesch,\r\nwhich was sold and dispersed after his death. From its unfinished\r\nstate and neglected condition it attracted little attention, and was\r\nbought literally \"dirt cheap\" by Mr. Macpherson, an English gentleman\r\nestablished as a photographer in Rome. After the dirt upon its face had\r\nbeen removed, it was submitted to competent judges, who unhesitatingly\r\npronounced it to be the work of Michelangelo. The discovery caused\r\na great sensation. A law-suit was instituted against Mr. Macpherson\r\nfor the recovery of the picture, which was sequestrated pending the\r\ndecision of the Roman courts. After some years he obtained a judgment\r\nin his favour, removed the picture to England, and sold it to the\r\nNational Gallery for £2000. Peter von Cornelius, the eminent German\r\npainter, in evidence in the law-suit declared it to be \"una cosa\r\npreziosa--un vero originale di Michelangelo.\"[183]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the picture is entirely characteristic of the\r\nschool of Michelangelo. What we notice in it most is not the features\r\nof the Maries, but the rendering of the corpse, in all its flaccid\r\nlimbs and muscles:--\r\n\r\n      \"Take the heads from a painting of Angelico,--very little but\r\n      drapery will be left;--drapery made redundant in quantity and\r\n      rigid in fold, that it may conceal the forms, and give a proud\r\n      or ascetic reserve to the actions of the bodily frame. Bellini\r\n      and his school, indeed, rejected at once the false theory\r\n      and the easy mannerism of such religious design, and painted\r\n      the body without fear or reserve, as, in its subordination,\r\n      honourable and lovely. But the inner heart and fire of it are\r\n      by them always first thought of, and no action is given to\r\n      it merely to show its beauty. Whereas the great culminating\r\n      masters, and chiefly of these, Tintoret, Correggio, and Michael\r\n      Angelo, delight in the body for its own sake, and cast it into\r\n      every conceivable attitude, often in violation of all natural\r\n      probability, that they may exhibit the action of its skeleton\r\n      and the contours of its flesh. Correggio and Tintoret learn the\r\n      body from the living body, and delight in its breath, colour,\r\n      and motion. Michael Angelo learned it essentially from the\r\n      corpse, and had great pride in showing that he knew all its\r\n      mechanism. The simplicity of the old religious art was rejected\r\n      not because it was false, but because it was easy; and the dead\r\n      Christ was thought of only as an available subject for the\r\n      display of anatomy\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch.\r\n      iv.; _Relation between Michael Angelo and Tintoret, passim_).\r\n\r\nThe ideal of the painter has in fact changed. The picture is in its\r\nessence not a devotional work: it is a study in the dead nude.\r\n\r\n\r\n794. A DUTCH COURTYARD.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter de Hooch_ (Dutch: 1630-about 1677).\r\n\r\n      Hooch (or Hooghe)--\"the indoor Cuyp,\" as he has been called,\r\n      and \"one of the glories of the Dutch School--is also one of\r\n      the glories of England,\" for it was here that his great merits\r\n      were first discovered, and that three-fourths of his pictures\r\n      are now preserved. \"There are,\" says Ruskin (_Modern Painters_,\r\n      vol. v. pt. ix. ch. viii. § 11), whilst tracing the general\r\n      insensitiveness of the Dutch School, \"deeper elements in De\r\n      Hooghe, sometimes expressed with superb quiet painting.\" He\r\n      chose the simplest subjects and used apparently the simplest\r\n      means. But his figures are always placed with the utmost\r\n      skill, and the details, so carefully wrought, are all made\r\n      contributory to the general idea of the picture. In producing\r\n      an effect of serenity, Hooch is unsurpassed. Of his life\r\n      nothing is known except that he was at Delft 1653-56, and that\r\n      afterwards he resided at Amsterdam. In his own country, a fine\r\n      picture by him so late as 1765 brought only 450 florins. In\r\n      1817 it fetched 4000 florins, whilst in 1876 the Berlin Gallery\r\n      paid £6000 for one of his pictures. At the Secrétan Sale in\r\n      1889 an \"interior\" by De Hooch fetched £11,040. The present\r\n      picture was bought in Paris in 1869 for £1722. No. 834 fetched\r\n      in 1804, £220; No. 835, in 1810, £187.\r\n\r\nThe whole picture, in its cheerful colour and dainty neatness, seems\r\nto reflect the light of a peaceful and happy home, in which everything\r\nis done decently and in order. They are no rolling stones, these Dutch\r\nburghers, but stay-at-home folk, whose pride is in the trimness of\r\ntheir surroundings. Every day, one thinks, the good housewife will thus\r\nlook to see that the dinner is duly prepared; every day the husband\r\nwill thus walk along the garden, sure of her happy greeting. The\r\npicture is signed, and dated 1665.\r\n\r\n\r\n796. A VASE OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Huysum_ (Dutch: 1682-1749).\r\n\r\n      Jan was the son and pupil of Justus van Huysum, a painter\r\n      of Amsterdam. By close study Jan attained great fame as a\r\n      flower-painter. The principal florists of Holland supplied him\r\n      with their choicest productions as subjects, and his reputation\r\n      soon spread throughout Europe. \"Whilst still young he became\r\n      rich and honoured, and reached the summit of fortune. The\r\n      prices noted in the sale catalogues of the eighteenth century,\r\n      which are altogether out of proportion to those realised by\r\n      other works, reveal to us with what infatuation this finished\r\n      master, so delicate, erudite, and careful, was regarded\"\r\n      (Havard: _The Dutch School_, p. 264). He usually arranged his\r\n      flowers in elegant vases, of which he finished the ornaments\r\n      in the most careful manner. He was fond also of introducing a\r\n      bird's nest with eggs. Both of these characteristics may be\r\n      seen in the picture before us. The care with which he rendered\r\n      every detail is remarkable. \"As to you, dear old Jan Van\r\n      Huysum,\" writes an artist of our own day, \"you have edified me\r\n      beyond expression. You teach me that a man can't be too careful\r\n      as to his work, be it what it may. Your pearly dewdrops on\r\n      the fresh gathered green things of the earth refresh me. Your\r\n      tiny ants on the petals of the pink teach me in their minute\r\n      contemplation to be like the star, _Ohne Hast, Ohne Rast_. How\r\n      cool, and calm, and cheerful, and confident you are, Jan!\"\r\n      (_Letters of James Smetham_, p. 173). \"The world is so old,\"\r\n      says Ruskin, \"that there is no dearth of things first-rate; and\r\n      life so short that there is no excuse for looking at things\r\n      second-rate. Let us then go to Rubens for blending, and to\r\n      Titian for quality, of colour; to Veronese for daylight, and\r\n      Rembrandt for lamplight; to Buonarroti for awfulness, and to\r\n      Van Huysum for precision. Any man is worthy of respect, in his\r\n      own rank, who has pursued any truth or attainment with all his\r\n      heart and strength\" (Letter to Liddell in the _Memoir_ of the\r\n      Dean, by H. L. Thompson, p. 224). Other pictures by Jan Van\r\n      Huysum may be seen in the Wallace Collection and the Dulwich\r\n      Gallery.\r\n\r\nSigned, and dated 1736-1737. Notice the bird's nest, with the\r\ngreenfinch's eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n797. A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Cuyp_ (Dutch: 1620-1691). _See 53._\r\n\r\nThis excellent portrait serves to remind us that, unlike most of his\r\nfellow landscape painters, Cuyp could paint his own figures. Indeed\r\nwe have seen that he sometimes painted them in other landscapes, see\r\nNo. 152. The picture is signed \"Aetatis suae 56, 1649. A. Cuyp fecit.\"\r\nCuyp is one of the most various of all the Dutch masters. \"What\r\nuniversality in the hand that could paint skies more glowing than\r\nthose of Both, clouds as vaporous as those of Van de Cappelle, water\r\nmore luminous than Van de Velde's, cattle as true to nature as Paul\r\nPotter's, horses better than Wouverman's, horsemen more distinguished\r\nthan Vandyck's! Sometimes, too--and there is a noble example in our\r\nNational Gallery--we find Aelbert Cuyp painting portraits, not in the\r\nstiff precise way that the father painted them, but with a freedom of\r\ntouch and a brilliancy of colour that place him between Van der Helst\r\nand Rembrandt\" (_Quarterly Review_, October 1891, and Fromentin's' _Les\r\nMaitres d'autrefois_, \"Hollande,\" ch. viii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n798. CARDINAL RICHELIEU.\r\n\r\n  _Philippe de Champaigne_ (French: 1602-1674).\r\n\r\n      A painter of historical subjects and portraits, he was born at\r\n      Brussels, but went to Paris at the age of 19. He was employed\r\n      by Du Chesne, the painter royal, to work at the Luxembourg in\r\n      concert with Nicolas Poussin. Du Chesne was of mediocre talent\r\n      and jealous disposition, and Champaigne and Poussin soon left\r\n      him. The two men were mutually attached, and in after years\r\n      Champaigne discoursed at a session of the Academy on the merits\r\n      of his friend Poussin. Champaigne returned to Brussels, but was\r\n      recalled in 1627 to succeed Du Chesne. He executed many works\r\n      for the churches and royal residences and also for Cardinal\r\n      Richelieu's palace. He became an original member of the French\r\n      Academy in 1648, of which he was also Professor and Rector.\r\n      Towards the end of his life, his fame began to pale before\r\n      that of Le Brun. His religious and historical works, of which\r\n      there are several in the Louvre, are apt to leave the modern\r\n      spectator cold; but his portraits are excellent.\r\n\r\nThis picture was painted for the Roman sculptor Mocchi to make a bust\r\nfrom, hence the two profiles as well as the full face. Over the profile\r\non the right are the words (in French), \"of the two profiles this is\r\nthe better.\" In this profile the compressed lips, the merciless eyes,\r\nthe iron-gray hair and prominent nose, bespeak the great Cardinal\r\nMinister of Louis XIII., and the maker of France, who summed up his\r\npolicy and his character in the words, \"I venture on nothing without\r\nfirst thinking it out; but once decided, I go straight to my point,\r\noverthrow or cut down whatever stands in my way, and finally cover it\r\nall up with my cardinal's red robes.\" In the full face one sees rather\r\nthe man who was also a princely patron of the arts and artists (of\r\nDe Champaigne amongst their number), and the founder of the French\r\nAcademy.[184] The central head here was clearly used as a study for the\r\nfull-length portrait, No. 1449.\r\n\r\n\r\n802. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Bartolommeo Montagna_ (Venetian: about 1450-1523).\r\n\r\n      Montagna was born near Brescia, and worked at Vicenza, but must\r\n      have studied at Venice.[185] \"He is entitled,\" says Kugler,\r\n      \"to a much higher place among the painters of the last part of\r\n      the fifteenth century than that hitherto accorded to him. His\r\n      art is distinct in character, with a firm outline and a bold,\r\n      sure hand; his colour is low but rich, bright, and gem-like. He\r\n      gives a grand, dignified expression and pose to his figures;\r\n      his draperies are generally arranged in broad folds, and his\r\n      landscape backgrounds, although minute, frequently denote\r\n      an original and poetical fancy.\" His best work is the great\r\n      altar-piece now in the Brera at Milan, a picture worthy to\r\n      rank with those of the same kind by Bellini and Carpaccio.\r\n      Other important works by Montagna are in the Public Gallery of\r\n      Bergamo, in the Museo Civico at Vicenza, and in the Pilgrimage\r\n      Church on Monte Berico, near Vicenza.\r\n\r\nThis picture is ascribed by some critics to Giovanni Speranza, a\r\npainter of Vicenza contemporary with Montagna.\r\n\r\n\r\n803. THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Marco Marziale_ (Venetian: painted 1499-1507).\r\n\r\n      Marco was one of the assistants engaged to work under Giovanni\r\n      Bellini in the decoration of the Ducal Palace. Whilst Bellini\r\n      received sixty ducats a year, Marco received only twenty-four.\r\n      Nothing else is known about his career. Of his works, which are\r\n      very rare, the best are in our Gallery.\r\n\r\nAn example which shows what wealth of interest there is in the National\r\nCollection. It is only by a second-rate painter of the Venetian school;\r\nbut no picture in the Gallery is richer than this in decorative design.\r\nNote first the varied and beautifully-designed patterns in the mosaics\r\nof the church--recalling one of the domes of St. Mark's. Then the\r\nlectern, covered with a cloth, and the delicately-embroidered border,\r\nwrought in sampler stitch, deserve close examination. The cushion\r\nabove this, and the tassels, formed of three pendent tufts of silk\r\nhung on to a gold embroidered ball, offer good decorative suggestions\r\nto the trimming manufacturer. Attached to the front of the lectern\r\nis a label or \"cartellino,\" setting forth that \"Marco Marziale the\r\nVenetian, by command of that magnificent knight and jurisconsult,\r\nthe learned Thomaseo R., made this picture in the year 1500.\" As it\r\nis probable that this was the first important commission Marco ever\r\nobtained on his own account, there is little wonder that he wrought\r\nthe record so elaborately. This \"Thomaseo R.\" was Raimondi, a knight\r\nof the order of Jerusalem--a man of considerable note in Cremona as a\r\nlawyer and poet. His portrait occupies the forefront of the right-hand\r\ncorner of the picture, his set features recalling the lawyer rather\r\nthan the poet. It is his mantle, however, which best repays notice--a\r\nsumptuous robe of raised red velvet, such a fabric as Venice was then\r\nwinning industrial renown by weaving. The very pretty pattern is of\r\nthe so-called \"pomegranate form,\" and occurs also on the mantle of the\r\ndonor's wife, who occupies a corresponding position on the left-hand\r\nside of the picture. In the South Kensington Museum there is a remnant\r\nof Italian silk brocade of this pattern (in the Bock collection). The\r\nrobe of the High Priest is also evidently taken by the painter from\r\na silk robe, and is very rich. The design, in which the wild pink is\r\nlargely introduced, is unique. Ruskin had a wall-paper made for him in\r\n1872 copied from this robe: it has ever since been used for the walls\r\nof the drawing-room and study at Brantwood. \"It will thus be seen that\r\nthis one picture brings before us a great number of suggestions in\r\ndesign for various technic arts; at least half a dozen patterns exist\r\nin the ornaments of the mosaic work of the vaults; five or six patterns\r\nof embroidered or woven borders will be found in it, as many designs\r\nfor diapered or other surface decoration, examples of beaten metal-work\r\nand of bookbinding, besides the carved wood lectern.\" For notice of\r\nother points, see further the interesting article by G. T. Robinson in\r\nthe _Art Journal_, June 1886, and cp. Vacher's _Italian Ornament_, No.\r\n24.\r\n\r\n\r\n804. MADONNA AND CHILD ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n  _Marco Marziale_ (Venetian: painted 1499-1507). _See 803._\r\n\r\nThis picture was painted seven years later (1507) than 803, which it\r\nresembles in the bright mosaics of the vault and the interesting\r\ndesign on the robe of the bishop on the left. Notice the little angel\r\nplaying the mandoline on the steps of the throne, characteristic of the\r\nearlier Venetian painters.\r\n\r\n\r\n805. PEELING PEARS.\r\n\r\n  _Teniers_ (Flemish: 1600-1694). _See 154._\r\n\r\n\r\n806. THE PROCESSION TO CALVARY.\r\n\r\n  _Boccaccio Boccaccino_ (Cremonese: about 1460-1525).\r\n\r\n      Boccaccino was a native of Cremona, where many of his works are\r\n      still preserved. \"All that is best in his art,\" says Morelli,\r\n      \"he derived from the school of the Bellini.\" In the Venetian\r\n      Academy is a beautiful \"mystic marriage of St. Catherine\"\r\n      which is signed by him. He is a painter, says Kugler, \"of very\r\n      distinct individuality, and may be easily recognised by the\r\n      peculiar type and expression of his figures, and especially by\r\n      his women, who generally have much grace and beauty. One of\r\n      his characteristics is a light-grey eye with a dark rim.\" This\r\n      picture is \"not characteristic of Boccaccino's manner, and is\r\n      probably by another hand\" (ii. 389).\r\n\r\nFor some remarks on the subject of this picture see under 1143.\r\n\r\n\r\n807. MADONNA AND CHILD ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Crivelli_ (Venetian: painted 1468-1493). _See 602._\r\n\r\nThis picture (like 724) is signed by \"_Sir_ Charles\": it is dated\r\n1491. It bears the painter's sign-manual also in the fruits and the\r\nvase of flowers. The giver of the picture (which was dedicated to the\r\nVirgin, and which, as recorded in a Latin inscription below, cost no\r\ninconsiderable sum) is kneeling, in the habit of a Dominican nun, at\r\nthe foot of the throne. On the Madonna's left is St. Sebastian, pierced\r\nwith arrows and tied to a pillar, but with the happy look of \"sorrow\r\nended\" on his face. On her right is St. Francis. Near his feet are\r\nsome flowers and a snail--typical of the kindness and humbleness of\r\nthe saint, of whom it is recorded that \"he spoke never to bird nor to\r\ncicala, nor even to wolf and beast of prey, but as his brother,\" and\r\nwho thus taught the lesson \"Never to blend our pleasure, or our pride,\r\nWith sorrow of the meanest thing that feels\" (_Wordsworth_).\r\n\r\n\r\n808. ST. PETER MARTYR.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_[186] (Venetian: 1426-1516). _See 189._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nA fancy portrait of a jolly comfortable-looking Dominican monk--a\r\nfaithful portrait doubtless. His face is painted as it really was,\r\n\"wart and all,\" but it has pleased him to be represented in the\r\ncharacter of Peter, a famous member of his order (see under 812).\r\n\r\n\r\n809. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Michael Angelo_ (Florentine: 1475-1564). _See 790._\r\n\r\nThe Virgin mother is seen withholding from the child Saviour the\r\nprophetic writings in which His sufferings are foretold. Angelic\r\nfigures beside them examine a scroll--\r\n\r\n    Turn not the prophet's page, O Son! He knew\r\n      All that Thou hast to suffer and hath writ.\r\n      Not yet Thine hour of knowledge. Infinite\r\n    The sorrows that thy manhood's lot must rue\r\n    And dire acquaintance of Thy grief. That clue\r\n      The spirits of Thy mournful ministerings,\r\n      Seek through yon scroll in silence. For these things\r\n    The angels have desired to look into.\r\n\r\n    Still before Eden waves the fiery sword,--\r\n      Her Tree of Life unransomed: whose sad tree\r\n      Of Knowledge yet to growth of Calvary\r\n      Must yield its Tempter,--Hell the earliest dead\r\n    Of Earth resign,--and yet, O Son and Lord,\r\n      The Seed o' the woman bruise the serpent's head.\r\n\r\n  D. G. ROSSETTI: _Sonnets and Ballads_.[187]\r\n\r\nThis picture was at one time attributed to Domenico Ghirlandajo; and\r\nSignor Frizzoni now attributes it to Granacci. But, says Sir Edward\r\nPoynter, \"the beauty of the figures, the nobility of the heads, and\r\nthe fine qualities of drawing and modelling stamp it as the work of\r\nthe great master himself.\" \"In my judgment,\" says Symonds (_Life of\r\nMichelangelo Buonarroti_, i. 65), \"this is the most beautiful of the\r\neasel pictures attributed to Michelangelo.... Florentine painters had\r\nbeen wont to place attendant angels at both sides of their enthroned\r\nMadonnas. But their angels were winged and clothed like acolytes;\r\nthe Madonna was seated on a rich throne or under a canopy, with\r\naltar-candles, wreaths of roses, flowering lilies. It is characteristic\r\nof Michelangelo to adopt a conventional motive, and to treat it with\r\nbrusque originality. In this picture there are no accessories to the\r\nfigures, and the attendant angels are Tuscan lads half draped in\r\nsuccinct tunics. The types have not been chosen with regard to ideal\r\nloveliness or dignity, but accurately studied from living models. This\r\nis very obvious in the heads of Christ and St. John. The two adolescent\r\ngenii on the right hand possess a high degree of natural grace. Yet\r\neven here what strikes one most is the charm of their attitude, the\r\nlovely interlacing of their arms and breasts, the lithe alertness of\r\nthe one lad contrasted with the thoughtful leaning languor of his\r\ncomrade. Only perhaps in some drawings of combined male figures made\r\nby Ingres, for his picture of the 'Golden Age,' have lines of equal\r\ndignity and simple beauty been developed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n810. PARDON DAY IN BRITTANY.\r\n\r\n  _Charles Poussin_ (French: born 1819).\r\n\r\n      M. Pierre Charles Poussin, a pupil of L. Cogniet, was an\r\n      exhibitor at the French _Salon_ from 1842 to 1882. Many of his\r\n      pictures were, like this one, of scenes in Brittany.\r\n\r\nThe scene is that of a fête held in honour of _Notre Dame de Bon\r\nSecours_ of Guingamp in Brittany, on the 2nd of July in every year.\r\nPope Paul V. in 1619 granted a plenary indulgence to all persons \"who\r\ntruly confessed and communicated, who shall visit the said church of\r\nNotre Dame de Guingamp on the day and fête of the Visitation of the\r\nBlessed Virgin Mary, which it is the custom every year to celebrate on\r\nthe 2nd day of July; who shall devotionally pray for the preservation\r\nof concord and peace among all Christian princes; who shall render\r\nhospitality to the poor pilgrims; who shall make peace with their\r\nenemies, and shall promote it amongst others--shall, in short, sweetly\r\nbring into the way of salvation some unfortunate and erring soul.\" An\r\nEnglish visitor published a long account of the fête in the _Standard_\r\nof July 5 and following days in 1870, describing \"the frank but sedate\r\nfestivity and merry-making under the trees.\" That was twenty years\r\nafter this picture was painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n811. TOBIAS AND THE ANGEL.\r\n\r\n  _Salvator Rosa_ (Neapolitan: 1615-1673). _See under 84._\r\n\r\nFor the subject of Tobias, who is in the water holding the fish,\r\nsee 781. The wild rocky landscape conveys a general sense of savage\r\npower. Salvator, says Ruskin, is \"a good instance of vicious\r\nexecution, dependent on too great fondness for sensations of power,\r\nvicious because intrusive and attractive in itself, instead of being\r\nsubordinate to the results and forgotten in them\" (_Modern Painters_,\r\nvol. i. pt. i. sec. ii. ch. ii. § 9).\r\n\r\n\r\n812. THE DEATH OF ST. PETER MARTYR.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_[188] (Venetian: 1426-1516). _See 189._\r\n\r\n      \"Peter Martyr was general of the Dominicans in 1252, a most\r\n      powerful person in the Holy Inquisition, and a violent\r\n      persecutor for what he deemed the true faith, which made him\r\n      many inveterate enemies. There was one family in particular\r\n      which he had treated with excessive cruelty, and their\r\n      relations, who were in the army, were so enraged by Peter's\r\n      barbarity that they resolved to revenge themselves.... Having\r\n      been informed that he was to make a visit to a distant province\r\n      in pursuit of some wretched heretics, who had been denounced to\r\n      the inquisition, they lay in wait for him in a wood, through\r\n      which they knew he must pass, in company with one person, a\r\n      friar of his convent; here they attacked him, cleft his skull\r\n      with a sabre, and left him dead on the spot\" (Mrs. Jameson;\r\n      _Handbook to the Public Galleries_, 1842, i. 70).\r\n\r\nThis picture, one of the painter's latest works, is interesting, first,\r\nfor its skill in landscape. It is a true piece of local scenery that\r\nBellini paints,--\"all Italian in masses of intricate wood and foliage,\r\nin plain, mountain, and buildings, and glowing, not under direct\r\nsunshine, but with the soft suffusion of southern light\" (_Layard_,\r\ni. 312). It is, says Ruskin, one of the six most beautiful landscapes\r\nin the earlier mediæval art, of the \"purist\" school, \"being wholly\r\nfelicitous and enjoyable.\" Every leaf is painted with loving care, and\r\nBellini treats the incident in the foreground as \"entirely cheerful\r\nand pleasing; it does not disturb or even surprise him, much less\r\ndisplease in the slightest degree.\" \"You see in a moment the main\r\ncharacteristic of the school,--that it mattered not in the least to\r\nJohn, and that he doesn't expect it to matter to you, whether people\r\nare martyred or not, so long as one can make a pretty grey of their\r\ngown, and a nice white of their sleeves, and infinite decoration\r\nof forest leaves behind, and a divine picture at last out of all.\r\nEverything in the world was done and made only that it might be rightly\r\npainted--that is the true master's creed\" (_Verona and its Rivers_, §\r\n27, and _Lectures on Landscape_, pp. 22, 65, 73).[189] Notice, further,\r\nBellini's compliance, as far as the subject admitted, with one of the\r\nconditions of the greatest art, \"serenity in state or action.\" \"You\r\nare to be interested in the living creatures; not in what is happening\r\nto them.... It is not possible, of course, always literally to observe\r\nthis condition, that there shall be quiet action or none; but Bellini's\r\ntreatment of violence in action you may see exemplified in a notable\r\nway in his \"St. Peter Martyr.\" The soldier is indeed striking the sword\r\ndown into his breast; but in the face of the Saint is only resignation\r\nand faintness of death, not pain--that of the executioner is impassive;\r\nand while a painter of the later schools would have covered breast and\r\nsword with blood, Bellini allows no stain of it; but pleases himself\r\nwith most elaborate and exquisite painting of a soft crimson feather\r\nin the executioner's helmet\" (_Relation between Michael Angelo and\r\nTintoret_, p. 16).\r\n\r\n\r\n814. DUTCH BOATS IN A CALM.\r\n\r\n  _P. J. Clays_ (Belgian: 1818-1900).\r\n\r\n      Paul Jean Clays was a native of Bruges. He studied art in Paris\r\n      under Gudin, and afterwards settled at Brussels, where in 1851\r\n      he received a gold medal. He frequently exhibited at the\r\n      French _Salon_, and was a chevalier of the Legion of Honour as\r\n      well as of the Order of Leopold. For a long time, says a French\r\n      critic, \"the sea, or rather the water, has had no interpreter\r\n      more exact than Clays: he knows its clearness, and he knows how\r\n      to render the little noisy waves, all bathed in light.\" \"He\r\n      does not paint the sea,\" says another, \"but the Scheldt where\r\n      it widens, and those gray and light waters that bear you on a\r\n      steamer from Moerdyk to Rotterdam. With a profound feeling for\r\n      these things he expresses the humidity of the skies of Western\r\n      Flanders, the sleep of the calmed waters, or the caressing, and\r\n      sometimes menacing, of the breeze which makes the little uneasy\r\n      waves stride around the barges loaded to the brim.\" Some of his\r\n      pictures have fetched very large prices--one having sold in New\r\n      York for £3550 (Miss Clement and Laurence Hutton: _Artists of\r\n      the Nineteenth Century_).\r\n\r\n\r\n815. DUTCH BOATS AT FLUSHING.\r\n\r\n  _P. J. Clays_ (Belgian: 1818-1900). _See 814._\r\n\r\n\r\n816. THE INCREDULITY OF ST. THOMAS.\r\n\r\n  _Cima da Conegliano_ (Venetian: 1460-1518). _See 300._\r\n\r\nA picture interesting among other things for its history. It is signed\r\nand dated (1504), and was painted as a commission for a religious\r\nfraternity, for the altar of their patron saint, St. Thomas, in the\r\nchurch of St. Francesco at Portogruario (near Conegliano). The price\r\npaid for it was equal to about £17 sterling, at that time representing\r\na considerable sum. The account of its cost and of a law-suit\r\ninstituted by the painter against the fraternity is still preserved.\r\nFor 328 years it remained in its original place; it was then removed\r\nby the local authorities, and in 1870 was sold to our Government.\r\nWhen bought it \"was greatly disfigured by various repaints, and was\r\notherwise in bad condition. Judicious cleaning and restoration (by Mr.\r\nWm. Dyer) have brought out its fine qualities. The heads are highly\r\nexpressive, and some of the figures ... of great dignity\" (_Layard_, i.\r\n325).\r\n\r\n\r\n817. TENIERS'S COUNTRY-SEAT AT PERCK.\r\n\r\n  _Teniers_ (Flemish: 1600-1694). _See 154._\r\n\r\n\"A perfect type of the Unromantic Art which was assailed by the gentle\r\nenthusiasm of the English School of Landscape. It represents a few\r\nordinary Dutch houses, an ordinary Dutch steeple or two, some still\r\nmore ordinary Dutch trees, and most ordinary Dutch clouds, assembled in\r\ncontemplation of an ordinary Dutch duck-pond; or, perhaps, in respect\r\nof size, we may more courteously call it a goose-pond. All these\r\nobjects are painted either gray or brown, and the atmosphere is of\r\nthe kind which looks not merely as if the sun had disappeared for the\r\nday, but as if he had gone out altogether, and left a stable lantern\r\ninstead. The total effect having appeared, even to the painter's own\r\nmind, at last little exhilatory, he has enlivened it by three figures\r\non the brink of the goose-pond--two gentlemen and a lady,--standing all\r\nthree perfectly upright, side by side, in court dress, the gentlemen\r\nwith expansive boots, and all with conical hats and high features.\r\nIn order to invest those characters with dramatic interest, a rustic\r\nfisherman presents to them, as a tribute,--or, perhaps, exhibits as a\r\nnatural curiosity,--a large fish, just elicited from the goose-pond by\r\nhis adventurous companions, who have waded into the middle of it, every\r\none of them, with singular exactitude, up to the calf of his leg\" (_Art\r\nof England_, pp. 209, 211). The group on the left comprise the painter\r\nand his wife, another lady, and his son.\r\n\r\n\r\n818. COAST SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Bakhuizen_ (Dutch: 1631-1708). _See 204._\r\n\r\n\r\n819. OFF THE MOUTH OF THE THAMES.\r\n\r\n  _Bakhuizen_ (Dutch: 1631-1708). _See 204._\r\n\r\nOn representations of rough weather by this painter and Vandevelde,\r\nRuskin writes as follows: \"If one could but arrest the connoisseurs in\r\nthe fact of looking at them with belief, and, magically introducing the\r\nimage of a true sea-wave, let it roll up through the room,--one massive\r\nfathom's height and rood's breadth of brine, passing them by but\r\nonce,--dividing, Red-Sea like, on right hand and left,--but at least\r\nsetting close before their eyes, for once in inevitable truth, what\r\na sea-wave really is; its green mountainous giddiness of wrath, its\r\noverwhelming crest--heavy as iron, fitful as flame, clashing against\r\nthe sky in long cloven edge,--its furrowed flanks all ghastly clear,\r\ndeep in transparent death, but all laced across with lurid nets of\r\nspume, and tearing open into meshed interstices their churned veil of\r\nsilver fury, showing still the calm gray abyss below; that has no fury\r\nand no voice, but is as a grave always open, which the green sighing\r\nmounds do but hide for an instant as they pass. Would they, shuddering\r\nback from this wave of the true, implacable sea, turn forthwith to the\r\npapillotes? It might be so. It is what we are all doing, more or less,\r\ncontinually\" (_Harbours of England_, p. 19). In default of the actual\r\nsea-wave, the visitor may be recommended to look next at Turner's\r\nrough seas (472 and 476). Such a comparison will show how much of the\r\nroughness in the Dutch pictures is due to mere blackness, how little to\r\nany terror in the forms of the waves, such as Turner depicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n820. LANDSCAPE WITH RUIN.\r\n\r\n  _Berchem_ (Dutch: 1620-1683). _See 78._\r\n\r\n\r\n821. A FAMILY GROUP.\r\n\r\n  _Gonzales Coques_ (Flemish: 1618-1684).\r\n\r\n      In spite of his Spanish-sounding name, this artist was a pure\r\n      Fleming. He was born at Antwerp and appears never to have left\r\n      his native town. His father, whose surname was Cocx, gave the\r\n      child the name of Gonzalvus: these names the painter afterwards\r\n      changed to Gonzales Coques. His first master was Peter Breughel\r\n      (the third painter of that name). He afterwards studied under\r\n      David Ryckhaert the Elder, whose daughter he married. His first\r\n      subjects were conversation-pieces and assemblies; but the\r\n      extraordinary reputation acquired by Van Dyck for his portraits\r\n      inspired Coques with the ambition to distinguish himself in\r\n      like manner, although on a smaller scale. There is in the\r\n      little works of Coques the same air of elegance and refinement\r\n      which distinguishes Van Dyck. Hence he has been called \"the\r\n      Little Van Dyck.\" His works, says Bürger, are \"Van Dycks seen\r\n      through the wrong side of the glass\"; or as another critic puts\r\n      it, \"Van Dycks in 18mo.\" They were greatly admired during his\r\n      lifetime, and he was patronised by Charles I., the Archduke\r\n      Leopold, and the Prince of Orange. His works, however, are very\r\n      rare; about half of them are in this country. He was admitted\r\n      as a master in the Guild of Painters in 1640-41, and twice\r\n      served as its Dean, in 1665-66 and 1680-81.\r\n\r\nNotice the youngest child in the go-cart, which is being pushed by\r\nanother of the children, whilst the eldest sister, as befits her\r\nyears, is playing the guitar. And the little dogs, as befits them,\r\nare sporting in front. It is pretty of the painter or his sitters to\r\ninclude them in the family group.\r\n\r\n\r\n822. AN EVENING LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Cuyp_ (Dutch: 1620-1691). _See 53._\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of the hazy, drowsy effect in which Cuyp excelled.\r\n\"A brewer by trade,[190] he feels the quiet of a summer afternoon, and\r\nhis work will make you marvellously drowsy. It is good for nothing\r\nelse that I know of; strong, but unhelpful and unthoughtful. Nothing\r\nhappens in his pictures, except some indifferent persons asking the way\r\nof somebody else, who, by the cast of countenance, seems not likely to\r\nknow it. For further entertainment, perhaps, a red cow and a white one;\r\nor puppies at play, not playfully; the man's heart not going even with\r\nthe puppies. Essentially he sees nothing but the shine on the flaps of\r\ntheir ears\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. chap. vi. § 12).\r\n\r\n\r\n823. ON THE MEUSE.\r\n\r\n  _Cuyp_ (Dutch: 1620-1691). _See 53._\r\n\r\nNotice the reflections. Cuyp \"is a man of large natural gift, and sees\r\nbroadly, nay, even seriously; finds out--a wonderful thing for men to\r\nfind out in those days--that there are reflections in the water, and\r\nthat boats require often to be painted upside down\" (_Modern Painters_,\r\nvol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. § 12).\r\n\r\n\r\n824. A RUINED CASTLE.\r\n\r\n  _Cuyp_ (Dutch: 1620-1691). _See 53._\r\n\r\nThe castle may be the same as that seen in No. 1289. Some lines from\r\nBeattie's \"Scotland\" have been applied to it:--\r\n\r\n    Behold our lakes ...\r\n    Each girdled with its mountain belt\r\n    Of rock and tower and forest trees,\r\n    And gemmed with island sanctuaries\r\n    Like floating palaces, they seem\r\n    The elysium of a poet's dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis picture was originally bought at Horn, in the Netherlands, of an\r\nold clothesman, for 1s. 3d. Sir Robert Peel paid 350 guineas for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n825. THE POULTERER'S SHOP.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard Dou_ (Dutch: 1613-1675). _See 192._\r\n\r\nThis picture, as an acknowledged _chef d'oeuvre_ of the master, has\r\nlong been celebrated. It was purchased by Sir Robert Peel from the\r\nFonthill Collection in 1823 for £1270. Mrs. Jameson, on seeing the\r\npicture at Sir R. Peel's, wrote: \"All executed with such a nicety of\r\ntouch--such an inconceivable truth and minuteness of imitation--as to\r\nrender the picture a very miracle of art. A higher merit consists in\r\nthe admirable painting of the heads, especially that of the old woman,\r\nwhich is full of life.\" \"A wicker market-basket is a common homely\r\nthing, but look at its presentment here--every polished, well-used\r\ntwig of it following the true undulations of form and colour, light\r\nand shade, through the marvellous patience and skill of the vanished\r\nDutchman--and see if it does not produce an exquisite poetic tremor\r\nby the thoughts it evolves. There is a dead image of the barnyard\r\ncock which Mr. Darwin may compare with the barndoor fowl of to-day as\r\naccurately as if it were photographed. His once fiery eye is glazed\r\nand sightless as a dim pearl, his neck feathers ruffled but no longer\r\nin anger or pride; his pale, amber-coloured legs helplessly and\r\ningloriously reversed, their impatient and masterful scratching among\r\nhis dames in the stubble over for ever; the glossy purples, greens,\r\nand blacks of his tail-feathers rising sharp and delicate out of the\r\nspeckled hazes of colour which it required days and days to lay side\r\nby side among the crushed and crowding plumes. The cock, the horologe\r\nof Thorpe's light, crows no more to the answering hill-farms. He is\r\ndestined for the spit of the housewife who holds up the hare. But his\r\nfate was glorious, for by what tens of thousands since the year 1650\r\nor thereabouts have his perfections been admired and praised. It was\r\nworth living for, and, to chanticleer, worth dying for, to become the\r\noccasion of such a miracle of art\" (Smetham's _Literary Works_, p. 240).\r\n\r\n\r\n826. FIGURES AND ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n827. FORDING THE STREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n828. LANDSCAPE WITH CATTLE.\r\n\r\n  _Karel du Jardin_ (Dutch: 1622-1678).\r\n\r\n      This painter was the ablest of the followers of Nicolas\r\n      Berchem, and like that master often painted Italian scenery. He\r\n      stayed for some years in Rome, where his pictures were greatly\r\n      admired, and where, in the jovial artist circles of the day,\r\n      he was given the nickname of \"Barbe de Bouc\" (goat's-beard).\r\n      On his return from Italy he is said to have stayed some time\r\n      at Lyons, where he married a widow with whom he afterwards\r\n      settled in Holland. He resided at the Hague from 1656 to 1659,\r\n      and there was much influenced by the example of Paul Potter.\r\n      He next moved to Amsterdam, which he made his home for some\r\n      years. He returned in the end to the Italian haunts of his\r\n      early years, and died at Venice. In his best pastoral works,\r\n      the truth and finish of his execution, the brilliancy of their\r\n      atmosphere, and the harmonious colouring, are attractive. He\r\n      also painted portraits and large groups, and executed some good\r\n      etchings.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of Du Jardin that his works are \"excellent when they\r\nare not detestable,\" a remark which is well exemplified in these\r\npictures. No. 827 is at once vulgar in incident and unpleasant in\r\ncolour. No. 826, on the other hand, one of the pastoral idyls for which\r\nDu Jardin is famous, is a _chef d'oeuvre_ of the painter (Sir Robert\r\nPeel paid 930 guineas for it). No. 828 has a true Italian air, and\r\nthere is a touch of almost pathetic humour in the contrast between the\r\ncow and the woman. It is the beast that has its eyes on the sunset and\r\nenjoys the benediction of the evening hour. The woman is cumbered with\r\nmuch serving, and spins with her back to the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n829. A STAG HUNT.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Hackaert_ (Dutch: 1629-1696).\r\n\r\n      Hackaert was a native of Amsterdam, but between the years\r\n      1653 and 1658 he travelled much in Switzerland, Germany, and\r\n      Italy. At this time he chose his subjects from the mountains.\r\n      In painting the landscape of his own country he especially\r\n      affected woodland views, with effects of light shining through\r\n      the trees.\r\n\r\nThe figures in this picture are attributed to N. Berchem.\r\n\r\n\r\n830. THE AVENUE, MIDDELHARNIS.\r\n\r\n  _Hobbema_ (Dutch: 1638-1709). _See 685._\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best rendering of a Dutch village in the Gallery--beautiful\r\nalike in its general effect and in the faithful way in which every\r\ncharacteristic of the country is brought out. Note the long avenue,\r\na High Street, as it were, of lopped trees, to lead the traveller to\r\nthe village; the bright red roofs, suggestive already in the distance\r\nof the cheerful cleanliness he will find; the broad ditch on either\r\nside of the road--the land reclaimed from the water, and the water\r\nnow embanked to fertilise the land; the neat plantations, allotments\r\nit may be, each as trim and well kept as a lawn; and lastly, the\r\nnursery-garden on the left, in which the gardener, smoking, like\r\nthe true Hollander, as he works, is pruning some grafted trees.\r\nMiddelharnis is one of several places that dispute the honour of being\r\nHobbema's birthplace.\r\n\r\nThis picture--which is signed, and dated 16-9 (third figure\r\nillegible)--is generally recognised as the painter's masterpiece. The\r\nsubject is unusual, showing a more open landscape and a wider expanse\r\nof sky than Hobbema ordinarily represented. The power and freshness\r\nwith which he has treated the theme are remarkable. \"Such daylight,\"\r\nsays Waagen, \"I have never seen in any picture.\" It is to be noted\r\nfurther that the artist makes no effort to attain the picturesque,\r\nand that the picture offends in some respects against the laws of\r\ncomposition. Thus \"M. Michel complains of the road coming straight,\r\nat once cutting the picture awkwardly in two, of the slender trees\r\nwith which it is symmetrically bordered, and which have on their tops\r\nonly small plumes of foliage, of the parallel ditches which hold in\r\nthe road on either side, and of the cross-road which cuts the picture\r\nhorizontally, and lastly, the rose-trees and shrubs planted regularly\r\nin straight lines. All this, he says, does not make a very picturesque\r\npicture. For our own part, it is the fearless and truthful manner in\r\nwhich Hobbema has treated what must at first sight have appeared an\r\nunpromising subject, that is one of its greatest charms\" (Cundall:\r\n_The Landscape Painters of Holland_, p. 53). Like Hobbema's pictures\r\ngenerally, this masterpiece was held in little honour in its own\r\ncountry. It was sold at Dort in 1815 for £90. Sir Robert Peel bought\r\nit in 1829 for £800. It is said to have been restored and retouched\r\nby Reinagle (see Mrs. Jameson's _Handbook to the Private Galleries of\r\nLondon_, p. 354 _n._).\r\n\r\n\r\n831. THE RUINS OF BREDERODE CASTLE.\r\n\r\n  _Hobbema_ (Dutch: 1638-1709). _See 685._\r\n\r\nThis fine picture also is somewhat unusual in subject for Hobbema, who\r\nwas ordinarily content with humble village scenes. It affords a good\r\ninstance of his literal truth to nature. M. Michel, in his monograph\r\non the painter, gives side by side a reproduction of it and a sketch\r\nfrom his own pen of the ruins as they exist to-day, which, with the\r\nexception of the addition of a modern barbaric bell-turret and some\r\nbattlements, preserve almost the identical appearance which Hobbema\r\nportrayed upwards of two centuries ago. \"The ivy continues to entwine\r\nits garlands round the disjointed bricks, and, as formerly, the ducks\r\nsport in the stagnant waters of the moat, or take a luxurious siesta\r\namidst the tufts of grass on its banks, while the rooks and crows,\r\ninstalled as masters in the recesses of the ancient walls, fill the\r\nair with their incessant cries\" (quoted in Cundall's _Landscape and\r\nPastoral Painters of Holland_, 1891, p. 52). The ducks[191] are\r\nascribed to Wyntrank; the figures to Lingelbach. The picture is\r\nsigned, and dated 1667. It was, however, at one time re-christened as\r\na Wijnants, in order to procure a better price at auctions. In 1825 it\r\nsold for £880.\r\n\r\n\r\n832. A VILLAGE WITH WATERMILLS.\r\n\r\n  _Hobbema_ (Dutch: 1638-1709). _See 685._\r\n\r\nThis is one of Hobbema's most usual subjects--a cottage, a mill, a few\r\ntrees. The effect is that of a summer sky, with light fleecy clouds,\r\nand gleams of sunshine seem to pass over the scene. Sir Robert Peel\r\npaid £525 for the picture. It should be compared with Ruysdael's of a\r\nsimilar scene (986).\r\n\r\n\r\n833. A FOREST SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Hobbema_ (Dutch: 1638-1709). _See 685._\r\n\r\n\r\n834. A DUTCH INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter de Hooch_ (Dutch: 1630-about 1677). _See 794._\r\n\r\nThis picture is interesting as enabling us to discern the painter's\r\ntechnical process. \"The more luminous parts of it, such as the costumes\r\nof the two men at the table, are painted in semi-opaque colour over a\r\nbrilliant orange ground. Here and there the orange may be seen peeping\r\nout, and its presence elsewhere gives a peculiar pearliness to the\r\ntints laid upon it. De Hooch painted very thinly. In this picture the\r\nmaid with the brazier is an afterthought. She is painted over the\r\ntiles and other details of the background, which now show through her\r\nskirts. Before she was put in, this space to the right was occupied by\r\nan old gentleman with a white beard and moustache, and a wide-brimmed\r\nhat, all of which can be descried under the brown of the mantelpiece\"\r\n(Armstrong: _Notes on the National Gallery_, pp. 36, 37).\r\n\r\n\r\n835. COURT OF A DUTCH HOUSE.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter de Hooch_ (Dutch: 1630-about 1677). _See 794._\r\n\r\nA courtyard at Delft: superbly painted, and a good picture of Dutch\r\nhome life--of its neatness, its cleanliness, its quiet, and its\r\ncontent. Notice over the entrance a commemorative inscription, partly\r\ncovered already by vine leaves, dated 1614. The day's work is done,\r\nand the wife stands in the porch, waiting for her husband's return;\r\na servant brings down the child too into the courtyard to greet its\r\nfather. \"It is natural to think your own house and garden the nicest\r\nhouse and garden that ever were.... They are a treasure to you which\r\nno money could buy,--the leaving them is always pain,--the return to\r\nthem a new thrill and wakening to life. They are a home and a place of\r\nroot to you, as if you were founded on the ground like its walls, or\r\ngrew into it like its flowers\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1876, p. 51). Such a\r\nhome (says Mr. Pater in his _Imaginary Portraits_) \"was, in its minute\r\nand busy wellbeing, like an epitome of Holland itself, with all the\r\ngood-fortune of its thriving genius reflected, quite spontaneously, in\r\nthe national taste. The nation had learned to content itself with a\r\nreligion which told little, or not at all, on the outsides of things.\r\nBut we may fancy that something of the religious spirit had gone,\r\naccording to the law of the transmutation of force, into the scrupulous\r\ncare for cleanliness, into the grave, old-world, conservative beauty\r\nof Dutch houses, which meant that the life people maintained in them\r\nwas normally affectionate and pure.\" This picture was much admired by\r\nConstable. \"The least mannered,\" he said, \"and consequently the best\r\npictures I have seen, are some of the works of De Hooge, particularly\r\none of an outdoor subject, at Sir R. Peel's. His indoors are as\r\ngood, but less difficult, as being less lustrous\" (Leslie's _Life of\r\nConstable_, p. 299). The picture is signed, and dated 1658.\r\n\r\n\r\n836. A VIEW IN HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n  _Philip de Koninck_ (Dutch: 1619-1688).\r\n\r\n      Koninck, or Koning, was born at Amsterdam and became a pupil of\r\n      Rembrandt. He painted historical subjects and portraits, but it\r\n      is for his landscapes that he is now most admired. These are\r\n      generally expansive views in which aerial perspective is well\r\n      given: \"The distances of the painters of the older schools had\r\n      been full of objects and figures as minutely rendered as those\r\n      on the foremost places, only ever so much smaller. Compare with\r\n      these distances the simply treated expanse of country offered\r\n      to view in P. de Koninck's landscapes. Here we do not have\r\n      merely a series of objects getting smaller as they recede, but\r\n      a far more generalised representation of the whole face of\r\n      nature bathed in an atmosphere in which objects are lost to\r\n      view\" (Baldwin Brown's _Fine Arts_, p. 301).\r\n\r\nThere is a repetition of this picture in the Royal Museum at the Hague.\r\nOne may presume that Koninck's pictures had aristocratic purchasers;\r\nfor, unlike the painters of \"pastoral landscape,\" he is fond of\r\nintroducing persons of distinction--here it is a hawking party; in 974\r\na carriage-and-six with outriders.\r\n\r\n\r\n837. THE HAY HARVEST.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Lingelbach_ (Dutch: 1623-1674).\r\n\r\n      Though a German by birth, Lingelbach is included amongst the\r\n      Dutch painters; for he lived chiefly in Amsterdam, and was\r\n      largely employed in inserting the figures in the landscapes of\r\n      Wynants and others. He also passed some years in Italy, and\r\n      frequently painted Italian scenes and incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n838. THE DUET.\r\n\r\n  _Gabriel Metsu_ (Dutch: 1630-1667).\r\n\r\n      Metsu is one of the _genre_ painters who are now appraised\r\n      most highly--sums of £2580 and £3200 severally were given\r\n      at the Secrétan Sale for pictures of his. In the Hertford\r\n      House Gallery are some good specimens which the late Sir\r\n      Richard Wallace acquired at great cost. Though, like most of\r\n      his brother-artists, he was fond of painting tavern-scenes\r\n      (_e.g._ No. 970), he was also a painter of high life and the\r\n      drawing-room, like Terburg and Netscher. \"In each of these\r\n      spheres he combined humour with expression, a keen appreciation\r\n      of nature with feeling, and breadth with delicacy of touch, in\r\n      a manner unsurpassed by any of his contemporaries\" (Crowe).\r\n      \"When his pictures have escaped the ordeal of ruthless cleaning\r\n      they are pervaded by the finest tone, and the whites in them\r\n      have that delicate glow which distance and atmosphere lend\r\n      to snowy peaks. It is obvious that he caressed this least\r\n      manageable of colours with unceasing love. Altogether his works\r\n      have a quality of distinction rare in those of any school\"\r\n      (Burton). Metsu's father was a painter, whose third wife (the\r\n      mother of Gabriel) was a painter's widow. The boy was taught by\r\n      Gerard Dou, and already at the age of fourteen was admitted a\r\n      member of the Leyden Guild of Painters. In 1650 he removed to\r\n      Amsterdam, where he fell under the influence of Rembrandt. The\r\n      large picture in the Louvre of \"The Woman taken in Adultery,\"\r\n      signed by Metsu and dated 1653, shows this fact. Metsu did not,\r\n      however, adhere to religious subjects, but applied the lessons\r\n      he learnt from the great master to subjects more congenial to\r\n      his talent.\r\n\r\n\r\n839. THE MUSIC LESSON.\r\n\r\n  _Gabriel Metsu_ (Dutch: 1630-1667).\r\n\r\nA picture that might serve as an illustration of \"the gamut of\r\nHortensio\" (see _Taming of the Shrew_, Act. iii. sc. 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n840. A LADY FEEDING A PARROT.\r\n\r\n  _Frans van Mieris_ (Dutch: 1635-1681).\r\n\r\n      This painter, the son of a goldsmith (one of twenty-three\r\n      children) and the pupil of Gerard Dou, is known as \"Old Frans,\"\r\n      to distinguish him from his grandson of that name, who, like\r\n      his son William (see 841), was also a painter. The works of\r\n      Frans are very much superior to those of his successors.\r\n      \"Unlike William Mieris, he rarely cared to carry the eye from\r\n      the beautiful painting of the figures by working up or covering\r\n      the base of the casement with highly finished bas-reliefs. That\r\n      kind of thing may be looked for in William Mieris's curiously\r\n      finished pictures, but certainly is not wanted in the works\r\n      of Francis. His female figures, independently of being always\r\n      well painted, are often graceful and pretty; he could paint a\r\n      lady at her toilet with the delicacy and feeling of Metsu and\r\n      Terburg, and was besides happy in varying the expressions and\r\n      faces of his female beauties; he was fond of painting them in\r\n      richly coloured jackets trimmed with fur. He was also a capital\r\n      hand at painting birds\" (Seguier). The elegance and high\r\n      technical qualities of his productions brought him numerous and\r\n      distinguished patrons. The Grand Duke of Tuscany visited him at\r\n      Leyden, and the Archduke Leopold William desired to attract him\r\n      to Vienna. Mieris, however, would not leave Leyden; nor did his\r\n      large and lucrative practice induce any carelessness or neglect\r\n      in his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n841. A FISH AND POULTRY SHOP.\r\n\r\n  _Willem van Mieris_ (Dutch: 1662-1747).\r\n\r\n      The son of Frans (see above, 840). He succeeded to his father's\r\n      practice, but was an indifferent imitator. A comparison between\r\n      him and the leading \"Little Masters of Holland\" will show the\r\n      difference between true finish and laborious trifling.\r\n\r\nDecidedly an \"artistic\" shop: notice the elaborate bas-relief (as also\r\nin 825), with marine subjects suitable to a fishmonger's, below the\r\nshop-window, and the handsome curtain ready to serve as shutters. The\r\npicture is sometimes called \"The Cat,\" from the cat eyeing the duck\r\nwhose head hangs from the window-sill.\r\n\r\n\r\n842. A GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  _Frédéric de Moucheron_ (Dutch: 1633-1686).\r\n\r\n      This painter came of an Antwerp family, but he studied and\r\n      afterwards settled at Amsterdam. He also studied and worked\r\n      for some years in Paris. He confined himself to landscape;\r\n      Lingelbach, A. van de Velde and others were employed to paint\r\n      in his figures.\r\n\r\nThe figures here are ascribed to Adrian van de Velde.\r\n\r\n\r\n843. BLOWING BUBBLES.\r\n\r\n  _Gaspard Netscher_ (Dutch: 1639-1684).\r\n\r\n      Netscher, one of the chief painters of Dutch \"high life,\" had\r\n      a somewhat eventful career. He was born at Heidelberg, which\r\n      was then being besieged. His mother, after seeing her two elder\r\n      children die of hunger before her eyes, escaped with Gaspard\r\n      through the investing lines to Arnheim. The boy was intended\r\n      for a doctor, but took to painting and studied under Terburg.\r\n      In 1659 he started on a tour to Italy, but at Bordeaux he fell\r\n      in love with a girl from Liège, whom he married. He settled\r\n      at Bordeaux, but his pictures, such as this, which are now\r\n      so much valued, then brought him but slight remuneration;\r\n      and after returning to the Hague, he turned his attention to\r\n      portrait-painting. Several of his portraits are of English\r\n      sitters, and it is supposed that he visited this country, but\r\n      this is uncertain. Netscher's portraits are generally on a\r\n      small scale, and very highly finished. He was patronised by\r\n      William III., and was rapidly acquiring fame, when he died at\r\n      the age of forty-five. His _genre_ pieces resemble those of F.\r\n      Mieris.\r\n\r\n\r\n844. MATERNAL INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n  _Netscher_ (Dutch: 1639-1684). _See 843._\r\n\r\nNotice in the background, over a cupboard, hanging in a black frame, a\r\nsmall copy of Rubens' \"Brazen Serpent,\" now in this collection (59).\r\n\r\n\r\n845. A LADY AT A SPINNING WHEEL.\r\n\r\n  _Netscher_ (Dutch: 1639-1684). _See 843._\r\n\r\n\r\n846. THE ALCHYMIST.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian van Ostade_ (Dutch: 1610-1685).\r\n\r\n      Adrian, the elder of the two Ostades, was a pupil of Frans\r\n      Hals. Later in life, he felt the influence of Rembrandt, and\r\n      he painted some religious subjects. But he is best known for\r\n      his scenes from peasant life. These are now greatly esteemed,\r\n      and pictures which the painter himself probably sold for a few\r\n      shillings now fetch hundreds and even thousands of pounds.\r\n      Adrian Ostade is the contemporary of Teniers, and it is\r\n      interesting to compare their respective delineations of rustic\r\n      life. \"The contrast lies in the different condition of the\r\n      agricultural classes of Brabant and Holland. Brabant has more\r\n      sun, more comfort, and a higher type of humanity; Teniers, in\r\n      consequence, is silvery and sparkling; the people he paints are\r\n      fair specimens of a well-built race. Holland, in the vicinity\r\n      of Haarlem, seems to have suffered much in war; the air is\r\n      moist and hazy, and the people, as depicted by Ostade, are\r\n      short, ill-favoured, and marked with the stamp of adversity on\r\n      their features and dress. The greatness of Ostade lies in the\r\n      fact that he often caught the poetic side of the life of the\r\n      peasant class, in spite of its ugliness and stunted form and\r\n      mis-shapen features. He did so by giving their vulgar sports,\r\n      their quarrels, even their quieter moods of enjoyment, the\r\n      magic light of the sun-gleam, and by clothing the wreck of\r\n      cottages with gay vegetation\" (Crowe). Ostade was especially\r\n      fond of the foliage of the vine. He is often coarse, but\r\n      sometimes shows a genuine sense of humour. He had, says Sir\r\n      F. Burton, \"artistic qualities of a high order--consummate\r\n      skill in composition and taste in arrangement; subtlety of\r\n      chiaroscuro and refined delicacy of colour; appropriate, and\r\n      never overstrained action in the figures, and precision,\r\n      combined with breadth, of handling. His earlier pictures are\r\n      the coolest in tone; those of his middle period more golden,\r\n      showing gradually the influence of Rembrandt. His drawings and\r\n      etchings are extremely fine.\" His father, Jan Hendrik, was a\r\n      weaver; the children adopted the name of Ostade from a small\r\n      hamlet, near Eindhoven, which their parents left to settle at\r\n      Haarlem. There Adrian lived and worked, being enrolled as a\r\n      member of the Civic Guard in 1636, and becoming Dean of the\r\n      Painters' Guild in 1662. He was twice married; the second time,\r\n      to a daughter of Jan van Goyen.\r\n\r\nUnder the three-legged stool is a paper on which is written a warning\r\nof the vanity of the alchymist's labour--_oleum et operam perdis_:\r\n\"you are wasting your cost and pains\"--a warning not unjustified in a\r\npainter's mouth, for more than one old master devoted the end of his\r\nlife to the fruitless task of making gold (_e.g._ Parmigiano, see 33).\r\nThe English painter, Romney, too, dabbled in alchemy when he was a\r\nyoung man, and in his declining years sketched a melodrama representing\r\nthe progress of an alchymist in quest of the philosopher's stone.\r\nThe picture is signed (on a shovel hanging against the wall), and\r\ndated 1661. It is, says Mr. J. T. Nettleship in a comparison between\r\nOstade and George Morland, \"a marvellous example of the _atmosphère de\r\ntableau_. Everything takes its place, but is also a wonder of finish.\r\nThe whole picture gives you a large feeling of space and tone. And\r\nthere is no bogeydom, no straining after weirdness; the whole is a\r\ncommon workshop, the scene of the man's daily life; he feeds well, one\r\nis sure--if he has dreams his face does not betray them, it is just\r\nthe face of a born craftsman. It is impossible to look at this picture\r\nwithout acknowledging the influence such work must have had on Morland.\r\nBut Morland never achieved such delicacy united to breadth, such finish\r\ncombined with harmony of effect, though before he took the wrong turn\r\nhe came near achieving it\" (_George Morland_, p. 23).\r\n\r\n\r\n847. A VILLAGE SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Isaac van Ostade_ (Dutch: 1621-1649).\r\n\r\n      Isaac, born at Haarlem, was the younger brother of Adrian van\r\n      Ostade, with whom he remained as pupil till 1641, when he set\r\n      up in business on his own account. There is a record of a\r\n      transaction of his in that year which throws an interesting\r\n      light on the picture-dealing world of the day. In 1643 a dealer\r\n      summoned him for breach of a contract made in 1641 to deliver\r\n      six pictures and seven \"rounds\" for twenty-seven florins. Part\r\n      of Isaac's defence was that his pictures had since risen in\r\n      value. The case was referred to the Painters' Guild, which\r\n      decided that he must perform his contract, but that the number\r\n      of the \"rounds\" should be reduced to five and the price of the\r\n      whole be increased to fifty florins. It may be conjectured that\r\n      the low value thus set upon the cottage scenes in his brother's\r\n      manner induced Isaac to cultivate a different style of his own.\r\n      This consisted largely of village inns (of which the present\r\n      picture is a capital example), and winter scenes (among which\r\n      No. 963 in our Gallery is a masterpiece). He combined a genuine\r\n      appreciation of nature with great skill in the treatment of\r\n      figures. He was fond, as will be seen, of introducing a white\r\n      horse to serve as the principal light in his compositions.\r\n\r\nThis picture was bought by Sir Robert Peel for 400 guineas, and was\r\nesteemed, says Mrs. Jameson in her catalogue of his collection, \"the\r\nmasterpiece of the painter. The transparent, sparkling beauty of the\r\nexecution was never surpassed. The figures, the foliage, the animals,\r\nthe atmospheric effect, are all perfect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n848. A SKATING SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Isaac van Ostade_ (Dutch: 1621-1649). _See 847._\r\n\r\n\r\n849. LANDSCAPE WITH CATTLE.\r\n\r\n  _Paul Potter_ (Dutch: 1625-1654).\r\n\r\n      Paul Potter, the best of the Dutch cattle painters, was the\r\n      son of an artist (see 1008), and a remarkable instance of\r\n      precocious talent, having been a clever painter and etcher\r\n      at the age of fourteen. The environs of Enkhuizen, where\r\n      he was born, did not offer scenes of surpassing beauty;\r\n      but the rich brown and gold tints of the cattle contrasted\r\n      pleasantly with the verdure of the flat fields. These Potter\r\n      set himself to study and to paint; and so accurately did he\r\n      master the anatomy of cattle that a writer on the natural\r\n      history of Holland, in 1769-79, did not hesitate to utilise,\r\n      in order to illustrate his work, paintings and sketches by\r\n      Potter, including geometrical drawings which he had made to\r\n      demonstrate the proper proportions of cattle. His skill brought\r\n      him much patronage at the Hague; and in 1650 he married the\r\n      daughter of a distinguished architect in that city, who made\r\n      some objections, it is said, to his daughter marrying a mere\r\n      \"painter of animals.\" But the painter of animals prospered\r\n      better than many of his contemporary painters of men, and\r\n      both at the Hague and at Amsterdam his works continued to be\r\n      in great request. But a too close application to his art told\r\n      on a weak constitution, and he died of consumption at the age\r\n      of twenty-nine (Cundall's _Landscape and Pastoral Painters\r\n      of Holland_, pp. 113 _sq._). For a century after his death\r\n      his works realised very small sums, but latterly they have\r\n      been sought after at extravagant prices. Technically they are\r\n      very accomplished; but Ruskin calls attention to a certain\r\n      defect of feeling in his treatment. He \"does not care even for\r\n      sheep, but only for wool; regards not cows, but cow-hides. He\r\n      attains great dexterity in drawing tufts and locks, lingers in\r\n      the little parallel ravines and furrows of fleece that open\r\n      across sheep's backs as they turn; is unsurpassed in twisting\r\n      a horn or pointing a nose; but he cannot paint eyes, nor\r\n      perceive any condition of an animal's mind except its desire of\r\n      grazing\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. § 12). In\r\n      estimating his work, it should however be remembered that he\r\n      died very young, and died learning. The famous \"Young Bull\" of\r\n      the Hague, painted in 1647 when he was twenty-two, is usually\r\n      considered his masterpiece. Rather, says Fromentin, is it only\r\n      a _tour de force_, a wonderful study. The portrait of the\r\n      painter as he appeared in his last days, done by his friend Van\r\n      der Helst, is in the Hague Museum.\r\n\r\nSigned, and dated 1651, and therefore among the painter's later works.\r\n\r\n\r\n850. A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See 45._\r\n\r\nDated 1635. The sitter wears the typical \"Rembrandt collar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n851. VENUS SLEEPING.\r\n\r\n  _Sebastiano Ricci_ (Venetian: 1659-1734).\r\n\r\n      An unimportant work by a painter who worked for several years\r\n      in this country, and covered many walls and ceilings with his\r\n      facile compositions. Examples of his religious and mythological\r\n      pictures may be seen at the Dulwich Gallery. Ricci, says\r\n      Dr. Richter in his catalogue of that collection, \"is one of\r\n      the most attractive painters of the Italian decadence. His\r\n      compositions are lively and ingenious, without, however, being\r\n      profound.\" There are also several of his works at Hampton\r\n      Court. He was born at Belluno in the Venetian State, and before\r\n      coming to England was employed by the Duke of Parma and at the\r\n      Viennese court in decorating the palace of Schoenbrunn. He left\r\n      England in disgust on finding that the work of decorating the\r\n      cupola of St. Paul's was to be entrusted to a native artist,\r\n      Sir James Thornhill. \"Ricci had great facility in imitating\r\n      the style of other masters. His picture of the 'Apostles\r\n      adoring the Sacrament' in the church of S. Giustina at Padua is\r\n      painted in imitation of the cupola of S. Giovanni at Parma by\r\n      Correggio; and his 'S. Gregorio' at Bergamo recalls the works\r\n      of Guercino. But his most successful imitations were those of\r\n      Paul Veronese, many of which he is said to have sold as by that\r\n      master. He deceived the French painter La Fosse, who avenged\r\n      himself by the sarcastic remark, 'For the future, take my\r\n      advice and paint no more Ricci's'\" (Bryan).\r\n\r\n\r\n852. THE CHAPEAU DE POIL.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See 38._\r\n\r\nOne of the best known and most be-copied pictures in the Gallery. Its\r\nfame among artists \"depends to no slight extent on its being a _tour\r\nde force_. The head is painted in reflected light, so as to come as\r\nnear as may be to Queen Elizabeth's _shadowless_ ideal\" (Armstrong:\r\n_Notes on the National Gallery_, p. 31). \"No one who has not beheld\r\nthis masterpiece of painting can form any conception,\" says Dr. Waagen,\r\n\"of the transparency and brilliancy with which the local colours in the\r\nfeatures and complexion, though under the shadow of a broad-brimmed\r\nhat, are brought out and made to tell, while the different parts are\r\nrounded and relieved, with the finest knowledge and use of reflected\r\nlights.\" The expression of the subject is as much a _tour de force_ as\r\nthe technical treatment--\r\n\r\n    I know a maiden fair to see,\r\n        Take care!...\r\n    She gives a side-glance and looks down,\r\n        Beware! beware!...\r\n    She has a bosom as white as snow,\r\n        Take care!\r\n    She knows how much it is best to show,\r\n        Beware! beware!\r\n        Trust her not,\r\n    She is fooling thee!\r\n\r\n  LONGFELLOW: from the German.\r\n\r\nThe picture is a portrait of Susanne Fourment, an elder sister of\r\nRubens's second wife, Helène Fourment. Susanne often sat to Rubens;\r\nother paintings and drawings of her by his hand exist. She afterwards\r\nmarried Arnold Lunden. The picture remained in the possession of the\r\npainter until his death, when it passed into that of Nicholas Lunden,\r\nwho had married Isabella, a daughter of Rubens by his second wife,\r\nHelène Fourment. The picture remained in the Lunden family until 1822,\r\nwhen it was sold by auction for 36,000 florins and brought to England.\r\nAfter being offered in vain to George IV., it was bought by Sir Robert\r\nPeel for 3500 guineas. Why and when this picture of a lady in a beaver\r\nhat acquired the inappropriate title of \"Chapeau de Paille\" (\"The Straw\r\nHat\"), by which it has hitherto been called, is unknown. Perhaps the\r\ntitle is a corruption of \"Chapeau d'Espagne.\" An entirely different\r\nstory about the picture was current in the Lunden family. According\r\nto this not very probable tradition, Miss Susanne had refused to sit\r\nto Rubens, so he painted her unawares whilst she was in her garden,\r\nwearing a large straw hat. When the picture was done, she pardoned the\r\nflattering indiscretion and accepted it as a gift. Rubens afterwards\r\nbegged leave to take back the portrait, promising in return a work\r\nin which he would put all his talent. This was a _replica_ of the\r\nsame portrait, but instead of a straw hat (_chapeau de paille_) he\r\nintroduced in the second version the beaver hat (_chapeau de poil_)\r\nthat we see. The Lunden family had christened the original \"Chapeau\r\nde Paille,\" and the present picture has ever since retained the same\r\ntitle. (See letter in the _Times_, August 6, 1886, from M. Jules Nollée\r\nde Noduwez, himself a connection of the Lunden family).\r\n\r\n\r\n853. THE TRIUMPH OF SILENUS.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See 38._\r\n\r\nFor the subject see under 93. \"Rubens painted these subjects with\r\na gusto in which there is something fearful, so wonderful is the\r\nskill, the felicity of execution, the life, the energy, the fancy\r\ndisplayed--so gross and so repulsive the sentiment. In Niccolo\r\nPoussin's Bacchanalian scenes we have the licence and the revels of\r\ngods and nymphs, and of the golden age. Rubens gives us, with perhaps a\r\ntruer moral feeling but more depraved taste, mere animal sensuality,\r\nwith all its most brutal attributes\" (Mrs. Jameson's _Handbook to the\r\nPrivate Galleries of London_, p. 362). This picture was in the artist's\r\npossession at the time of his death, and was then bought for Cardinal\r\nRichelieu. It was afterwards in the collection of Sir Robert Peel, who\r\ngave £1100 for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n853. a-p.\r\n\r\nThese sixteen drawings by Rubens formed part of the rich collection of\r\nSir Thomas Lawrence, P.R.A., after whose death they were acquired for\r\nSir Robert Peel. They were purchased for the nation in 1871 with the\r\nPeel Collection of pictures. The subjects are as follows:--\r\n\r\n      =853 a=, =b=, =c=, and =d=. Four studies for the famous picture\r\n      at Munich, representing the \"Fall of the Damned.\" In black\r\n      chalk, tinted slightly. \"Inconceivably fine,\" says Mrs. Jameson.\r\n\r\n      =853 e.= THE MARTYRDOM OF A SAINT.--He kneels, and a woman is\r\n      about to bind his eyes. Fifteen figures with angels.\r\n\r\n      =853 f.= THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST.--Study for the picture\r\n      at Munich.\r\n\r\n      =853 g.= THE CRUCIFIXION.--Drawing from the great picture at\r\n      Antwerp, done for the engraver to work from.\r\n\r\n      =853 h.= PORTRAIT OF A GIRL; with a cap and feather. Study from\r\n      one of his own children.\r\n\r\n      =853 i.= PORTRAIT OF A LADY, with flowers in her hair. Probably\r\n      a study from his first wife. \"Extremely fine,\" says Mrs.\r\n      Jameson, \"and full of life.\"\r\n\r\n      =853 j.= HEAD OF A LADY, in chalk and sepia, wonderfully\r\n      spirited.\r\n\r\n      =853 k.= SKETCH FOR MONUMENTAL SCULPTURE, or design for a\r\n      frontispiece--with a figure of \"Fame.\"\r\n\r\n      =853 l.= THE SAME, with figures of Moses and Aaron.\r\n\r\n      =853 m.= THE SAME, with satyrs.\r\n\r\n      =853 n.= THE SAME, representing the siege of Breda: Minerva and\r\n      Hercules, prisoners, implements of war, etc.\r\n\r\n      =853 o.= STUDY OF A LIONESS, introduced into his picture of\r\n      \"Daniel in the Lion's Den.\"\r\n\r\n      =853 p.= SKETCH OF A LION HUNT.--Study for the great picture at\r\n      Dresden.\r\n\r\n\r\n854. A FOREST SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1628-1682). _See 627._\r\n\r\nOf this picture, when it was in Sir Robert Peel's collection, Mrs.\r\nJameson tells a pretty tale. \"'I cannot express to you,' said the\r\nstatesman, 'the feeling of tranquillity, of restoration, with which,\r\nin an interval of harassing official business, I look around me here.'\r\nAnd while he spoke, in the slow, quiet tone of a weary man, he turned\r\nhis eyes on a forest scene of Ruysdael, and gazed on it for a minute\r\nor two in silence, as if its cool, dewy verdure, its deep seclusion,\r\nits transparent waters stealing through the glade, had sent refreshment\r\ninto his very soul\" (_Handbook to the Private Galleries of London_, p.\r\nxix.).\r\n\r\n\r\n855. A WATERFALL.\r\n\r\n  _Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1628-1682). _See 627._\r\n\r\n\r\n856. THE MUSIC-MASTER.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Steen_ (Dutch: 1626-1679).\r\n\r\n      It is in the collections of Holland, and especially in the\r\n      Museum of Amsterdam, that the best works of this remarkable\r\n      painter are to be seen--a painter whose talent and occasional\r\n      grace made Reynolds name him in the same breath with Raphael,\r\n      and who has by other critics been called the Molière of\r\n      painting. This latter comparison happily expresses the dramatic\r\n      and intellectual quality of Steen's best works. He drew not\r\n      merely Dutch life, but human nature. He depicts the comedy\r\n      of human life, for the most part, in a spirit of genial\r\n      toleration, but sometimes with touches of almost Hogarthian\r\n      satire. With regard to technical qualities, his best works are\r\n      admirable for their skilful composition, brilliant touch, and\r\n      harmonious colouring. \"Steen when it pleased him was an artist\r\n      of great ability. Unfortunately it did not always please him\r\n      to be so, and then his colour became blurred, his execution\r\n      trivial, and the general aspect of his figures heavy and\r\n      monotonous; but whenever he exerts himself he becomes once\r\n      more and remains a great master. It is the more astonishing\r\n      to find these defects, as they are peculiar neither to the\r\n      beginning nor to the end of his career, and therefore cannot\r\n      be attributed to a hard apprenticeship or premature decay.\r\n      They are to be explained by the irregular life which the\r\n      painter led\" (Havard). The number of his works, however,--of\r\n      which more than 500 have been catalogued--seem to negative the\r\n      stories in which some biographers accept of Steen's drunken\r\n      and dissolute life. He was the son of a brewer and was born at\r\n      Leyden. He first studied under a German painter, Knüpfer, at\r\n      Utrecht; afterwards with Adrian van Ostade, and Jan van Goyen\r\n      whose daughter he married in 1649. In the previous year he had\r\n      joined the Painters' Guild of Haarlem. That he was improvident\r\n      is proved by records of executions for debt which have been\r\n      discovered in the archives of that town. His pictures must have\r\n      fetched small prices, for he contracted to pay the year's rent\r\n      of his house for 1666-67 with three portraits \"painted as well\r\n      as he was able,\" the rent being 29 florins. In 1669 his wife\r\n      and his father died, and Steen, who is supposed to have resided\r\n      for some years at the Hague, returned to Leyden and opened a\r\n      tavern, and for the rest of his life combined the businesses of\r\n      painter and publican.\r\n\r\nA work of some humour. The music-master is sadly bored with the\r\nexercises of his pupil at the harpsichord, but his disgust is fully\r\nshared by the young brother whose turn is to come next, and who is\r\nbringing a lute into the room. The picture is signed on the harpsichord.\r\n\r\n\r\n857, 858, 859, 860. THE FOUR SEASONS.\r\n\r\n  _Teniers_ (Flemish: 1610-1694). _See 154._\r\n\r\nVery interesting little pictures, as characteristic of the entire\r\nwant of poetry in Teniers' art. Compare Mantegna's version of\r\nSummer and Autumn (1125), or recall Botticelli's lovely vision of\r\nSpring at Florence, and one sees in a moment the difference in art\r\nbetween poetical imagination and vulgarity. To Teniers, Spring--\"the\r\nsweet spring, the year's pleasant king\"--is only a man carrying a\r\nflower-pot. Summer--\"all the sweet season of summertide\"--suggests\r\nnothing but a man holding a wheat-sheaf. Autumn--\"season of mists\r\nand mellow fruitfulness\"--brings him only a first glass of wine;\r\nand Winter--\"white winter, rough nurse, that rocks the dead cold\r\nyear\"--only a second. These pictures (which are painted on copper),\r\nwere once in the possession of Prince Talleyrand, and Sir Robert Peel\r\nbought them in 1823 for £189.\r\n\r\n\r\n861. A COUNTRY SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Teniers_ (Flemish: 1610-1694). _See 154._\r\n\r\nThe man with the barrow is a portrait of Teniers' gardener.\r\n\r\n\r\n862. THE SURPRISE.\r\n\r\n  _Teniers_ (Flemish: 1610-1694). _See 154._\r\n\r\nHardly an instance in which \"vice itself loses half its evil by losing\r\nall its grossness.\" It is a very vulgar intrigue. The husband courts\r\nwithout passion; the maid-servant \"stoops to folly\" without grace; the\r\nwife surprises the lovers without dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\n863. THE RICH MAN IN HELL.\r\n\r\n  _Teniers_ (Flemish: 1610-1694). _See 154._\r\n\r\nThe sequel to the story of Dives and Lazarus. \"And it came to pass,\r\nthat the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's\r\nbosom: the rich man also died, and was buried. And in hell he lift\r\nup his eyes, being in torments\" (Luke xvi. 22, 23). A favourite\r\nsubject with Teniers, giving him an opportunity for painting comic\r\nmonstrosities.\r\n\r\n\r\n864. THE GUITAR LESSON.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard Terburg_ (Dutch: 1617-1681).\r\n\r\n      Terburg is the most refined of all the Dutch painters of\r\n      \"conversation pieces.\" He depicts with admirable truth, both\r\n      in his portraits and _genre_ pictures, the life of the wealthy\r\n      and cultured classes of his time. His figures are well drawn\r\n      and expressive, and the accessories are duly subordinated.\r\n      He renders the texture of draperies with great skill, and\r\n      his colouring is at once rich and quiet. He was the son of a\r\n      wealthy man, a traveller and a connoisseur who himself imparted\r\n      the rudiments of art to his son. Gerard afterwards studied in\r\n      Amsterdam and Haarlem. In 1635 he visited England, and thence\r\n      made the grand tour of the Continent, studying the works of\r\n      Titian and others. On his return to Holland he remained some\r\n      time at Amsterdam, learning much from the works of Rembrandt.\r\n      In 1646 he was at Münster, where he painted the famous picture,\r\n      No. 896 in our Gallery. This excited such admiration on account\r\n      of the excellence of its portraits and general truth to nature,\r\n      that the Spanish ambassador took Terburg with him to Madrid,\r\n      where he was knighted by Philip IV. and had the opportunity of\r\n      adding a study of Velazquez to his artistic advantages. Terburg\r\n      settled eventually at Deventer, where he married and became\r\n      burgomaster: a full-length portrait of him in that capacity is\r\n      in the Museum at the Hague.\r\n\r\nThis is a characteristic example of the painter's conversation pieces.\r\nSir Robert Peel bought it in 1826 for 920 guineas.\r\n\r\n\r\n865. A COAST SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van de Cappelle_ (Dutch: painted about 1650-1680).\r\n\r\n      Of this painter, whose works have of recent years become\r\n      popular with collectors, the Dutch writers have left no record.\r\n      Nor has anything been discovered about him beyond the fact\r\n      that, on the occasion of his marriage in 1653, he received the\r\n      freedom of the city of Amsterdam. One may connect with this\r\n      fact the state barge, introduced in some of his pictures,--or\r\n      the corporation barge, it may be,--much resembling the barges\r\n      belonging to the City and the City Companies which not long ago\r\n      might still be seen on the Thames at London, and some of which\r\n      survive, transformed into College barges at Oxford. Cappelle's\r\n      works are comparatively rare; they show that he loved a calm\r\n      sea, lit up with warm rays.\r\n\r\n\r\n866. A STREET IN COLOGNE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van der Heyden_ (Dutch: 1637-1712).\r\n\r\n      Van der Heyden (or Heyde), who has been called, from the\r\n      minute neatness of his workmanship, \"the Dou of architectural\r\n      painters,\"[192] was one of the first Dutch artists to devote\r\n      himself to that class of subject. It was a result no doubt of\r\n      the Italianising tendency of the time. \"It would seem that they\r\n      required to be initiated in this style by the views of foreign\r\n      market-places and squares with which the Italianising painters\r\n      had decorated the saloons of Amsterdam, and that in the\r\n      presence of this invasion of forums and piazzas they exclaimed,\r\n      'Have we not streets, squares, and monuments to paint?'\"\r\n      (Havard: _The Dutch School_, p. 238). Of course they had; and\r\n      no works of the time are more interesting than these minute\r\n      historical records. \"A striking feature in Van der Heyden is\r\n      the pencilling or dividing of the brickwork of the houses and\r\n      walls by delicate white lines; so finely are these drawn that\r\n      if it were not for the trouble, one might count the bricks\r\n      in his buildings\" (Seguier). But he had the art of combining\r\n      this microscopic detail with breadth of effect. The division\r\n      of labour in art work was in his time very fully applied; and\r\n      Van der Heyden's range was very limited. He seldom turned his\r\n      hand to anything but brick houses and churches in streets or\r\n      squares, or rows along canals, or the moated granges common in\r\n      his native country. He could draw neither man nor beast, and\r\n      relied on Adrian van der Velde to enliven his street scenes\r\n      with spirited figures. Van der Heyden was born at Gorcum, and\r\n      was apprenticed to a glass-painter. He then moved to Amsterdam\r\n      and studied architectural drawing. He visited England, Belgium,\r\n      and the Rhenish Provinces. In the later part of his life he\r\n      varied the practice of art with the pursuit of mechanics, for\r\n      which he had a strong turn. He invented various improvements\r\n      in the fire-engine, introduced the use of street-lamps, and at\r\n      the time of his death was superintendent of the lighting and\r\n      director of the firemen's company at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIn the background is seen the then unfinished tower of Cologne\r\nCathedral surmounted by the old vane. This was a favourite subject of\r\nthe painter; there is another version of it in the Wallace Collection.\r\nThe figures are attributed to A. van de Velde.\r\n\r\n\r\n867. THE FARM COTTAGE.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1636-1672).\r\n\r\n      Adrian, the son of William van de Velde the elder, the marine\r\n      painter, first studied under his father, and next under\r\n      Wynants, the landscape painter. He showed his talent very\r\n      early. \"Wynants,\" said that painter's wife, when the young\r\n      Adrian entered his studio, \"you have found your master.\" He\r\n      afterwards studied the figure under Wouwerman. His talent was\r\n      versatile, for he painted figures, animals, and landscapes with\r\n      equal truth and refinement. His large canvases (_e.g._ No. 80\r\n      in the Wallace Collection) are hard, and leave the spectator\r\n      cold; but his cabinet pictures are refined in outline and\r\n      delicate in tone. He was fond of village scenery with cattle\r\n      introduced, in which kind are several good examples in our\r\n      Gallery. He was also successful in winter scenes. Of his sandy\r\n      coast scenes there is a choice example in the Six Collection\r\n      at Amsterdam. The value and interest of many pictures by\r\n      Ruysdael, Van der Heyden, Hobbema, and other painters of the\r\n      time, were enhanced by figures inserted by Adrian. He must have\r\n      had wonderful facility and industry, for in addition to these\r\n      insertions, and in spite of his short life, the catalogue of\r\n      his own pictures includes nearly 200 items.\r\n\r\nThis picture is signed, and dated 1658. The effect is that of a fine\r\nwarm summer afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n868. THE FORD.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1636-1672). _See 867._\r\n\r\n\"The figures and faces,\" says Mrs. Jameson in her catalogue of the Peel\r\nCollection, \"are finished with inexpressible delicacy; the animals\r\nare painted with characteristic truth; the foliage of the trees seems\r\nstirred by the breeze;--in short, it is a most rare piece of work in\r\nevery part, and full of pastoral sentiment, though there is certainly\r\nnothing Arcadian in the personages introduced.\" Sir Robert Peel bought\r\nthe picture in 1840 for 760 gs.\r\n\r\n\r\n869. A FROST SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1636-1672). _See 867._\r\n\r\nThis picture--known as \"Les Amusements d'Hiver\"--is signed, and dated\r\n1668. The men are playing hockey. Other figures are occupied with a\r\nsledge. On the left is a refreshment booth.\r\n\r\n\r\n870. SHIPPING IN A CALM.\r\n\r\n  _W. van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1633-1707). _See 149._\r\n\r\nA dogger, with hanging sail, in the foreground; behind it a\r\nfrigate--\"and a variety of vessels, at every different gradation of\r\ndistance, carry the eye back to the horizon. The air and ocean are\r\nstill as sleep. Signed, and dated 1657, when the painter was only 24.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n871. BATHING AT LOW WATER.\r\n\r\n  _W. van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1633-1707). _See 149._\r\n\r\nIncidentally a good study in the \"philosophy of clothes.\" The\r\npainter hits off with much humour the essential difference between\r\nthose who regard man as \"by nature a naked animal\"--seen in the\r\nnaked bathers--and those who regard him as emphatically \"a clothed\r\nanimal\"--seen in the prim old gentleman who gets himself carried on a\r\nman's back. Intermediate between these two classes are those who use\r\nclothes as a convenience, but are not entirely subject to them--such,\r\nfor instance, is the comfortable old fellow smoking his pipe and wading\r\nhome, not without obvious contempt for the old gentleman riding, as\r\naforesaid, in ignominious slavery to his \"Sunday best.\" Dated 1661;\r\nbought by Sir Robert Peel from the collection of the Duc de Berri.\r\n\r\n\r\n872. A SLIGHT BREEZE.\r\n\r\n  _W. van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1633-1707). _See 149._\r\n\r\n\r\n873. THE COAST OF SCHEVENINGEN.\r\n\r\n  _W. van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1633-1707). _See 149._\r\n\r\n\"A scene well known to those who have visited the Hague, and frequently\r\nrepresented by Van de Velde. There are the high sand-hills to the\r\nleft, and above them are seen a few fishermen's huts and the little\r\nchurch of Scheveningen. Along the beach are numerous figures, variously\r\ngrouped and employed; the most conspicuous are several persons near a\r\npost-waggon. The sea is quietly rolling in to the shore, impelled by a\r\nlight breeze. The figures are painted with exquisite finish and spirit\r\nby Adrian van de Velde\" (Mrs. Jameson). Sir Robert Peel bought this\r\npicture from the Pourtalès Collection for £800. It is a characteristic\r\nspecimen of the master, showing how his version of the sea was coloured\r\nby that \"mixture of sand and sea-water\" which belongs to his native\r\ncoasts. \"I have come,\" writes Fromentin, \"to Scheveningen. Before me is\r\nthe calm, gray, fleecy North Sea. Who has not seen it? One thinks of\r\nRuysdael, of Van Goyen, of Van de Velde. One easily finds their point\r\nof view. I could tell you the exact place where they sat, as if the\r\ntrace of them had remained imprinted for two centuries: the sea is on\r\nthe left; the ridged sand-hills stand out on the right, stretch away,\r\ndiminish and are lost insensibly in the dim horizon; the grass is poor;\r\nthe sand-hills are pale; the sea-shore is colourless; the sea is like\r\nmilk; the sky has silky clouds and is wonderfully aerial.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n874. A CALM AT SEA.\r\n\r\n  _W. van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1633-1707). _See 149._\r\n\r\nA Dutch frigate and a small English cutter becalmed. \"There is a repose\r\nin the air, a clearness in the still, smooth sea, quite indescribable\"\r\n(Mrs. Jameson).\r\n\r\n\r\n875. A LIGHT BREEZE.\r\n\r\n  _W. van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1633-1707). _See 149._\r\n\r\nTwo doggers in the foreground; behind one of them, a Dutch frigate.\r\n\r\n\r\n876. A GALE.\r\n\r\n  _W. van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1633-1707). _See 149._\r\n\r\n\r\n877. HIS OWN PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See 49._\r\n\r\nThat Van Dyck was at a very early age a portrait-painter of rare merit\r\nmay be seen, from this likeness of himself while still quite young and\r\nbeardless. In the Wallace Collection there is another early portrait of\r\nhimself, in the character of Paris. Our picture is the portrait of an\r\nartist and a man of refinement. Notice especially the long, tapering\r\nfingers--delicate almost to the point of feminineness. They are very\r\ncharacteristic of Van Dyck's work, who, indeed, drew all his hands\r\nfrom one model: the same delicate fingers may be seen in the so-called\r\n\"portrait of Rubens\" (49). In giving this delicacy to all sitters Van\r\nDyck fell no doubt into mannerism; in giving it to great artists such\r\nas himself he was entirely right. Palmistry assigns fine, tapering\r\nfingers to \"artistic temperament,\" and rightly, for fine fingers are\r\nnecessary for fine work. \"The art of painting, properly so called,\r\nconsists in laying on the least possible colour that will produce the\r\nrequired result; and this measurement, in all the ultimate--that is to\r\nsay the principal--operations of colouring, is so delicate that not\r\none human hand in a million has the required lightness\" (_Two Paths_,\r\nAppendix iv., where much interesting matter on this subject will be\r\nfound).\r\n\r\n\r\n877 A. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n\r\n877 B. RINALDO AND ARMIDA.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See 49._\r\n\r\nThese drawings were bought with the Peel Collection. The former is the\r\nstudy for an altar-piece of the church of St. Michael at Ghent--\"a most\r\nsuperb drawing,\" says Mrs. Jameson. The latter is a drawing prepared\r\nfor the engraver, Peter de Jode, from the large picture of the subject\r\nin the Louvre. It was the sight of that picture that determined King\r\nCharles I. to secure the services of Van Dyck.\r\n\r\n\r\n878. \"THE PRETTY MILKMAID.\"\r\n\r\n  _Philips Wouwerman_ (Dutch: 1619-1668).\r\n\r\n      Wouwerman--whose pictures may nearly always be told by a\r\n      white horse, which is almost his sign-manual--is selected\r\n      by Ruskin as the central instance of the \"hybrid school of\r\n      landscape.\" To understand this term we must recall his division\r\n      of all landscape, in its relation to human beings, into the\r\n      following heads: (1) _Heroic_, representing an imaginary\r\n      world inhabited by noble men and spiritual powers--Titian;\r\n      (2) _Classical_, representing an imaginary world inhabited by\r\n      perfectly civilised men and inferior spiritual powers--Poussin;\r\n      (3) _Pastoral_, representing peasant life in its daily\r\n      work--Cuyp; (4) _Contemplative_, directed to observation of\r\n      the powers of nature and record of historical associations\r\n      connected with landscape, contrasted with existing states\r\n      of human life--Turner. The _hybrid_ school of which Berchem\r\n      and Wouwerman are the chief representatives is that which\r\n      endeavours to unite the irreconcilable sentiment of two\r\n      or more of the above-mentioned classes. Thus here we have\r\n      Wouwerman's conception of the heroic in the officers and in\r\n      the rocky landscape; of the pastoral in the pretty milkmaid,\r\n      to whom an officer is speaking, and who gives her name to the\r\n      picture. So again the painter's desire to assemble all kinds\r\n      of pleasurable elements may be seen in the crowded composition\r\n      of an adjoining picture (879). Wouwerman is further selected\r\n      by Ruskin as the chief type of vulgarity in art--meaning by\r\n      vulgarity, insensibility. He introduces into his pictures--see,\r\n      for instance, 879--every element that he thinks pleasurable,\r\n      yet has not imagination enough to enter heartily into any of\r\n      them. His pleasure is \"without a gleam of higher things,\" and\r\n      in his war-pieces there is \"no heroism, awe or mercy, hope or\r\n      faith.\" With regard, finally, to the execution, it is \"careful\r\n      and conscientious,\" the tone of his pictures generally dark\r\n      and gray, the figures being thrown out in spots of light\r\n      (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. viii.). \"There is no\r\n      good painting,\" Ruskin says of a Wouwerman at Turin, \"properly\r\n      so called, anywhere, but of clever, dotty, sparkling, telling\r\n      execution, as much as the canvas will hold\" (_ibid._ § 8).\r\n      Wouwerman was born at Haarlem; his father was a painter. From\r\n      him Philips learnt the practice of art, afterwards studying\r\n      landscape under Wynants. He worked for some time at Hamburg, in\r\n      the studio of Everard Decker. In 1640 he returned to Haarlem,\r\n      where he remained for the rest of his life. He had two brothers\r\n      who were also painters. His productivity was enormous. He\r\n      lived forty-nine years, and it has been calculated that even\r\n      if we deny his authorship of one half the pictures ascribed to\r\n      him, we leave him with at least 500, or about one for every\r\n      three weeks during his productive years (Bryan's _Dictionary\r\n      of Painters_). Few galleries are without several pictures by\r\n      Wouwerman. In the Wallace Collection he is represented by six,\r\n      in the Dulwich Gallery by ten.\r\n\r\nThe picture is known after the milkmaid whom the officer is chucking\r\nunder the chin, whilst the trumpeter takes a sarcastic pleasure, we may\r\nsuppose, in sounding all the louder the call \"to arms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n879. THE INTERIOR OF A STABLE.\r\n\r\n  _Wouwerman_ (Dutch: 1619-1668). _See 878._\r\n\r\nThe profusion of pleasurable incident in this picture has already been\r\nnoticed (see under 878) in connection with Wouwerman's bent of mind;\r\nbut notice also how the crowded composition spoils the effect of a\r\npicture as a picture. Clearly also will it spoil the stable-keeper's\r\nbusiness. He eyes the coin which one of his customers is giving him\r\nwith all the discontent of a London cabman, and has no eye to spare\r\nfor the smart lady with her cavalier, who are just entering the\r\nstable. This is a good instance of what has been called \"Wouwerman's\r\nnonsense-pictures, a mere assemblage of things to be imitated, items\r\nwithout a meaning\" (W. B. Scott: _Half-hour Lectures on Art_, p. 299).\r\n\r\n\r\n880. ON THE SEA SHORE.\r\n\r\n  _Wouwerman_ (Dutch: 1619-1668). _See 878._\r\n\r\nThis picture was formerly in the collection of Queen Elizabeth of\r\nSpain, whose arms are stamped on the back. Sir Robert Peel bought it in\r\n1823 for 450 guineas.\r\n\r\n\r\n881. GATHERING FAGGOTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n882. A LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Wouwerman_ (Dutch: 1619-1668). _See 878._\r\n\r\n\r\n883. A BEGGAR BY THE ROADSIDE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Wynants_ (Dutch: about 1615-1679).\r\n\r\n      Wynants--spelt also Wijnants--the painter of the sandy wayside,\r\n      was one of the founders of the Dutch school of landscape, and\r\n      was an artist of much originality. Out of a few docks and\r\n      thistles, it has been said, a tree, and a sandbank, he could\r\n      make a picture. \"In the choice of his subjects Wijnants shows\r\n      a preference,\" says Sir F. Burton, \"for open scenery, where,\r\n      under a sky of summer blue broken by illuminated cloud-masses,\r\n      the undulating soil reveals its nature through beaten tracks\r\n      and rugged roads with their shelving sides of gold-coloured\r\n      sand, while trees are scattered thinly on the slopes. Or he\r\n      loves the borders of the forest, where mighty tree-trunks,\r\n      smitten by past storms, still extend some gnarled branches\r\n      across the sky, or a fallen stem lies half imbedded amongst\r\n      tall grasses and large-leaved plants. In such scenes Wynants is\r\n      particularly attractive. They give us the poetry of form and\r\n      light, as Ruisdael's deep pine-forests give us that of gloom\r\n      and solitude.\" Of his life little is known. He was probably\r\n      born about the year 1615, as his earliest pictures bear the\r\n      dates 1641 and 1642. He was still living in 1679, as one of his\r\n      paintings in the Hermitage of St. Petersburg bears that date.\r\n      In October 1642 the registers of St. Luke's Guild at Haarlem\r\n      mention a Jan Wijnants as dealer in works of art; this probably\r\n      refers to the painter. He resided at Haarlem, and afterwards\r\n      at Amsterdam. Wouwerman and A. van de Velde were among his\r\n      scholars, the latter artist and others inserted figures in his\r\n      pictures, for Wynants painted only landscape. The visitor will\r\n      find good examples of him at Dulwich and Hertford House.\r\n\r\nThe picture is signed (on the trunk of the felled tree) and dated 1659.\r\nThe figures in this and the next picture are ascribed to A. van de\r\nVelde.\r\n\r\n\r\n884. SAND DUNES.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Wynants_ (Dutch: about 1615-1679). _See 883._\r\n\r\nIt is not uninteresting to notice--as strangely in keeping with the\r\npoor and hard country here depicted--that in nearly every picture by\r\nWynants (see 883, 971, 972) there is a dead tree. That Dutch painters\r\nwere alive to the beauties of vegetation, the oaks of Ruysdael are\r\nenough to show; but to Wynants at least nature seems to have been\r\nvisible only as a destroying power, as a rugged and conflicting force,\r\nagainst which the sturdy Hollander had to battle for existence as best\r\nhe might.\r\n\r\n\r\n895. PORTRAIT OF A WARRIOR.\r\n\r\n  _Piero di Cosimo_ (Florentine: 1462-1521). _See 698._\r\n\r\nFrancesco Ferruccio, of whom this is said to be a portrait, was the\r\nFlorentine general whose skill and patriotism shed a lustre on the\r\nfinal struggle of Florence against the combined forces of the Pope and\r\nthe Emperor. He was then in command of the outlying possessions of\r\nFlorence, and had there been a second Ferruccio within the city itself\r\nthe fortune of war might have been different. Francesco was killed in\r\na battle near Pistoia on August 3, 1530. In the background of this\r\nportrait there is a view of the Piazza della Signoria at Florence; and\r\nat the entrance door Michael Angelo's statue of David, which was placed\r\nthere in 1504. The picture was formerly ascribed to Lorenzo Costa;\r\nthe recognition of its true authorship is due to Dr. Richter and Dr.\r\nG. Frizzoni. The identification of the warrior with the celebrated\r\ngeneral is considered doubtful by them (see Richter's _Italian Art\r\nin the National Gallery_, p. 36; and Frizzoni's _Arte Italiana del\r\nRinascimento_, p. 252).\r\n\r\n\r\n896. THE PEACE OF MÜNSTER.\r\n\r\n  _Terburg_ (Dutch: 1617-1681). _See 864._\r\n\r\nOne of the \"gems\" of the National Collection--\"priceless\" because\r\nnot only of its great artistic merit, but of its unique historical\r\ninterest. It is an exact representation by a contemporary Dutch painter\r\nof one of the turning-points in Dutch history--the ratification,\r\nnamely, by the delegates of the Dutch United Provinces, on 15th May\r\n1684, of the Treaty of Münster, with which the eighty years' war\r\nbetween Spain and the United Provinces was concluded, altogether to\r\nthe advantage of the latter. The clerk (in a scarlet cloak) is reading\r\nthe document. The plenipotentiaries are standing nearest to the table.\r\nSix of them, holding up the right hand, are the delegates of the\r\nUnited Provinces; two, with their right hands resting on an open copy\r\nof the Gospels, are the representatives of Spain. One of the Dutch\r\ndelegates and one of the Spanish hold copies of the document, which\r\nthey follow as it is being read by the clerk. The brass chandelier, it\r\nis interesting to note, still hangs in the hall at Münster. The painter\r\nhas introduced his own portrait among the figures on the left, in\r\nthree-quarter face, behind the officer who stands with one arm resting\r\non the chair of the third Dutch delegate (counting from the left).\r\n\r\nDuring his lifetime Terburg did not part with the picture. It passed\r\nat one time into the possession of Prince Talleyrand, and by a curious\r\ncoincidence was hanging in the room of his hotel, under the view of the\r\nAllied Sovereigns, at the signing of the treaty of 1814. After several\r\nmore changes of hands it was bought in 1868 by the late Marquis of\r\nHertford for £8800--equivalent, the curious in such things may like\r\nto know, to nearly £24 per square inch of canvas; at his death it\r\ncame into the possession of Sir Richard Wallace, who presented it to\r\nthe nation in 1871. A curious story is told in this connection. At\r\nthe De Morny sale in 1865 the picture had been sold for £1805. At the\r\nSan Donato (or Demidoff) sale, three years later, Sir William Boxall,\r\nDirector of the National Gallery, bid up to £6000 for it; but his\r\nmandate went no further, and his mortification was great when he found\r\nhimself far outbid by the Marquis of Hertford. Three years later,\r\nan unknown gentleman, not too smartly dressed, was announced at the\r\nNational Gallery, and began to open a small picture-case. Sir William\r\nwas busy, and \"could not go into the matter now.\" \"But you had better\r\njust have a glance--I ask no more,\" said the stranger. Sir William\r\nrefused. The stranger insisted. Boxall, struck dumb at the sight of\r\nthe picture it had been his dream to add to the National Collection,\r\nraised his eyes to those of the visitor. \"My name is Wallace,\" said\r\nthe stranger quietly, \"Sir Richard Wallace; and I came to offer this\r\npicture to the National Gallery.\" \"I nearly fainted,\" said Boxall in\r\nrecounting the story; \"I had nearly refused 'The Peace of Münster,'\r\none of the wonders of the world\" (M. H. Spielmann: _The Wallace\r\nCollection_, p. 107).\r\n\r\n\r\n901. A LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Looten_ (Dutch: about 1618-1681).\r\n\r\n      Looten is said to have visited England in the reign of Charles\r\n      II., in order (as a countryman of his explains) \"to initiate\r\n      the English into the beauties of Dutch landscape.\" The process\r\n      was successful, for many large pictures by Looten are (or were)\r\n      in English country-seats. The figures in his landscapes were\r\n      sometimes painted by Berchem.\r\n\r\n\r\n902. \"THE TRIUMPH OF SCIPIO.\"\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Mantegna_ (Paduan: 1431-1506). _See 274._\r\n\r\nOne of the _grisailles_, or pictures in gray and brown, of which\r\nMantegna in his later years painted very many, and to multiply which\r\nhe took to engraving. In its subject the picture is a piece of ancient\r\nRome. No other works of the time, it has been said, are so full of\r\nantique feeling as Mantegna's. Botticelli played with the art of the\r\nancients and modernised it; Mantegna actually lived and moved in it\r\n(Woltmann and Woermann: _History of Painting_, translated by Clara\r\nBell, ii. 378). Mantegna's classical scholarship, too, is abundantly\r\nshown in the details of this picture, which is full of allusions to\r\nLatin authors and history. The Triumph of Scipio, it may be briefly\r\nexplained, consisted in his being selected by the Senate as \"the\r\nworthiest man in Rome,\" by whom alone--so the oracle decreed--must\r\nCybele, the Phrygian mother of the gods, be received. It was \"an\r\nhonour,\" says Livy, with the fine patriotism of Rome, \"more to be\r\ncoveted than any other which the Senate or people could bestow.\" On\r\nthe left, the image of the goddess is being borne on a litter, and\r\nwith it the sacred stone alleged to have fallen from heaven. It was an\r\nunusual fall of meteoric stones that had caused the Romans to consult\r\nthe oracle in B.C. 204, during Hannibal's occupation of Italy, and the\r\noracle had answered that the Phrygian mother must be brought to Rome.\r\nThis goddess, worshipped under different forms in many parts of the\r\nworld, was a personification of the passive generative power in nature,\r\nand from this time forward she was included among the recognised\r\ndivinities of the Roman State. In the centre of the picture Scipio and\r\nhis retinue are receiving her; whilst Claudia, a Roman lady, has thrown\r\nherself before the image. Some slur had attached to her reputation, but\r\nshe had proved her innocence by invoking the goddess and then drawing\r\noff from a shoal in the harbour of Ostia, with the aid of only a slight\r\nrope, the vessel which bore the sacred image.\r\n\r\n\"The picture,\" says Sir F. Burton, \"has a history of its own. It was\r\nundertaken towards the close of Mantegna's long and laborious career;\r\nand when that career terminated in the sadness and gloom which have\r\ntoo often awaited those whose imaginative powers had placed them\r\nabove their fellow-men, it remained in his studio, probably not fully\r\nfinished. It may have been the last, it was certainly one of the last,\r\npictures which his pencil touched.\" An advance payment of 25 ducats had\r\nbeen made to Mantegna in 1504. His son Francesco made an unsuccessful\r\nclaim to it as an inheritance from his father, offering to repay the\r\namount received in advance. The picture, representing an event glorious\r\nin the history of the Scipios, was commissioned by a Venetian nobleman,\r\nFrancesco Cornaro, in order to throw lustre upon the genealogy of his\r\nfamily, which claimed to belong to the Roman _gens Cornelia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n903. CARDINAL FLEURY.\r\n\r\n  _Hyacinthe Rigaud_ (French: 1659-1743).\r\n\r\n      Rigaud was a native of Perpignan, and the son and grandson\r\n      of a painter. In 1681 he went up to Paris, and following\r\n      the advice of Le Brun devoted himself to portraiture. He\r\n      studied diligently the works of Van Dyck, whose disciple\r\n      he always professed to be. He rapidly obtained fame as a\r\n      portrait-painter, but it was not till 1700--on the completion\r\n      of his \"St. Andrew\" now in the Louvre--that he was admitted as\r\n      an historical painter into the Academy. He held various offices\r\n      in that body, and painted all the great men of his day. His own\r\n      portrait by himself is in the Uffizi.\r\n\r\nA portrait of the famous tutor, and afterwards prime minister, of Louis\r\nXV. It is eminently the \"pacific Fleury,\" who strove to keep France\r\nout of war and starved her army and navy when she was forced into it,\r\nthat we see in this amiable old gentleman--the scholar and member\r\nof the Academy, who completed what is now the National Library of\r\nFrance--rather than the statesman. A similar picture is in the Wallace\r\nCollection (No. 130).\r\n\r\n\r\n904. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Gregorio Schiavone_ (Paduan: painted about 1470). _See 630._\r\n\r\n\r\n905. THE MADONNA IN PRAYER.\r\n\r\n  _Cosimo Tura_ (Ferrarese: 1420-1495). _See 772._\r\n\r\nTura's type of the Madonna is perhaps the least pleasing in the whole\r\nrange of Italian art.\r\n\r\n\r\n906. THE MADONNA IN ECSTASY.\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Crivelli_ (Venetian: painted 1468-1493). _See 602._\r\n\r\nThe latest of Crivelli's dated pictures in the Gallery (1492), and\r\nremarkable for the deep colours which mark the artist's highest powers.\r\nNotice the usual hanging fruit and the pot of roses and carnations.\r\nThe Virgin looks up to the Almighty and the dove, while two angels,\r\nwith a scroll, support a crown over her head. On the scroll are\r\ninscribed (in Latin) the words, \"As I was conceived in the mind of God\r\nfrom the beginning, so was I also made.\"\r\n\r\n      The masterpiece known as \"The Virgin in Ecstasy,\" rather\r\n      presents (as the text shows) the idea which is the foundation\r\n      of the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, combined with\r\n      the \"Coronation\" of the glorified mother. It is intended, in\r\n      fact, to bring before us not the historical mother of Christ\r\n      so much as that mediæval conception of the mystical being of\r\n      Ecclesiasticus and the Book of Wisdom, existing from all time\r\n      in the mind of God as the instrument of the Incarnation, and\r\n      returning to share the glory of her divine Son. Crivelli has\r\n      expressed with rare distinction that combination of humility\r\n      and awe with a sense of personal dignity which befits this\r\n      ideal of the Virgin. In herself she is an imposing figure,\r\n      but she is absorbed in the divine influences which mould her\r\n      destiny. Never did Crivelli come nearer to the grand style than\r\n      in this magnificent conception (Rushforth's _Crivelli_, p. 75).\r\n\r\n\r\n907. ST. CATHERINE AND ST. MARY MAGDALENE.\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Crivelli_ (Venetian: painted 1468-1493). _See 602._\r\n\r\nThe figure of St. Mary Magdalene, with the vase of precious ointment,\r\nis characteristic of the painter's more affected style; notice\r\nespecially the fingers elongated to the point of grotesqueness.\r\n\r\n\r\n908. THE NATIVITY OF CHRIST.[193]\r\n\r\n  _Piero della Francesca_ (Umbrian: 1416-1492). _See 665._\r\n\r\n      \"This painting is said to be unfinished. But even minute\r\n      details, such as the pearls on the robes of the angels and on\r\n      the head-dress of the Virgin, have been worked out with an\r\n      accuracy which excites astonishment. One of the two shepherds,\r\n      standing on the right side and seen in front, appears to have\r\n      no pupils to his eyes, and this strange fact might account for\r\n      the theory of the unfinished state of the picture. On the other\r\n      hand it seems to me to have suffered very much from repainting\r\n      in all the flesh parts.... The restorer has, I believe,\r\n      forgotten to paint in the pupils of the shepherd's eyes after\r\n      having destroyed them by the cleaning of the original painting\"\r\n      (Richter's _Italian Art in the National Gallery_, pp. 16, 17).\r\n      The beauty of the picture is in the choir of angels with their\r\n      mouths in different attitudes of singing, making such music\r\n      sweet\r\n\r\n      As never was by mortal finger strook--\r\n    Divinely-warbled voice\r\n    Answering the stringèd noise,\r\n      As all their souls in blissful rapture took.\r\n\r\n  MILTON: _Hymn on Christ's Nativity_.\r\n\r\n\"The picture is a masterpiece\" says Mr. Hipkins, \"in musical\r\ndelineation. It is the perfectly expressed singing of these\r\ncharacteristic angels that arrests attention first; but the\r\narchæologist in musical instruments values the two large lutes held by\r\nthe outside angels of the group, who are accompanying the singers. The\r\nsplendid lines and fine dimensions of these instruments suggest their\r\nsonorous tone. When this picture came from the Barker Collection, each\r\nlute had eleven strings, and the number of pegs in one of them seems\r\nto have this number; but in cleaning the picture the strings have\r\ndisappeared. As the picture was not finished by the painter, it is\r\nsupposed that the strings were a later addition. However, the number\r\nwas right, according to the practice with large lutes at that time, to\r\ngive six open notes; the highest, or melody, string being open\"[194]\r\n(_The Hobby Horse_, No. 1, 1893). \"The figures of the Virgin and Child\r\nare of the gentlest and fairest type, and show undoubted signs of the\r\nFlemish influence, which made itself felt in Florence and throughout\r\nCentral Italy after Hugo van der Goes set up his great altar-piece\r\nin the Ospedale of Santa Maria Novella\" (W. G. Waters: _Piero della\r\nFrancesca_ p. 64).\r\n\r\nThis picture was formerly in the possession of the Marini-Franceschi\r\nfamily, of Borgo San Sepolcro, descendants of the painter. The wings\r\nand the predella once belonging to it are in the cathedral of that city.\r\n\r\n\r\n909. THE MADONNA OF THE WHITE ROSE.\r\n\r\n  _Benvenuto da Siena_ (Sienese: 1436-1518).\r\n\r\n      The earliest known work by this painter is an Annunciation,\r\n      painted in 1466, in the church of S. Girolamo at Volterra. He\r\n      executed some of the illuminations of the choir-books, and\r\n      designed portions of the pavement, in the cathedral of Siena.\r\n      He was the son of a mason.\r\n\r\nA charming combination of older and newer \"motives.\" There is the gold\r\nbackground, true to the old Sienese traditions, but there are also the\r\nlittle fiddling angels, so common in Venetian and other pictures of the\r\ntime of Benvenuto's later years. In the compartments on either side are\r\nSt. Peter, and St. Nicholas of Bari (with various adornments referring\r\nto his story: see under 1171).\r\n\r\n\r\n910. THE TRIUMPH OF CHASTITY.\r\n\r\n  _Luca Signorelli_ (Cortona: 1441-1523). _See under 1128._\r\n\r\nIn the foreground Cupid on his knees is bound by maidens; in the\r\ndistance there are other two groups, in one of which the god of love is\r\nbeing captured, in the other he is led away in triumph with his arms\r\npinioned behind him. This painting is a fresco which was transferred\r\nto canvas from the wall of a palace at Siena. It was injured in the\r\nprocess, and has been badly restored. It is signed LUCAS CORITIUS, and\r\naccording to the official catalogue, \"the hand of the master is visible\r\nenough in the less damaged parts.\" According to other authorities, the\r\ninscription is forged, and the picture \"a weak production by Genga,\"\r\nSignorelli's assistant at Orvieto (Richter's _Italian Art in the\r\nNational Gallery_, p. 49).\r\n\r\n\r\n911. ULYSSES AND PENELOPE.\r\n\r\n  _Pinturicchio_ (Umbrian: 1454-1513). _See 693._\r\n\r\nPenelope was wife of Ulysses, King of Ithaca, whose wanderings after\r\nthe Trojan war are told in Homer's \"Odyssey,\" and shown in summary\r\nin the distance of this picture. Through the open window is seen the\r\nship of Ulysses, with the hero bound to the mast; the sirens, whose\r\ncoasts he passed unhurt, are sporting in the sea; and on an island\r\nnear is the palace of Circe, who changed his companions into swine.\r\nIn his absence Penelope was beset by many suitors, such as are here\r\nseen clad in joyous raiment, and was in sore straits to resist their\r\nimportunity. But \"some god put it into my heart to set up a great web\r\nin the halls, and thereat to weave a robe fine of woof and very wide;\r\nand-anon I spake among them, saying: 'Ye princely youths, my wooers,\r\nnow that goodly Odysseus is dead, do ye abide patiently, how eager\r\nsoever to speed on this marriage of mine, till I finish the robe ...\r\neven this shroud for the hero Laertes, father of Odysseus, against the\r\nday when the deadly doom shall bring him low, of death that lays men at\r\ntheir length.' ... So spake I, and their high hearts consented thereto.\r\nSo then in the daytime I would weave the mighty web, and in the night\r\nunravel the same\" (xix. 138-150: Butcher and Lang's translation). And\r\nfor the space of three years Penelope's web was still unwoven, and the\r\nsuitors were deceived; but afterwards, when they chid her loudly, she\r\nfinished the web, and could neither escape marriage nor devise any\r\nfurther counsel, for that her son too chafed while the suitors devoured\r\nhis livelihood. But Ulysses then returned; he is now in the doorway\r\njust entering; and presently Penelope will take down her husband's\r\nbow--now hanging with a quiver of arrows above her head--which the\r\nsuitors could not bend, but was bent by Ulysses.\r\n\r\nThe painter makes no attempt at archæological reconstruction; he gives\r\nus a picture of the costumes of his own day. This vivacious picture is\r\na fresco transferred to canvas. It was painted in the Pandolfo Petrucci\r\nPalace at Siena, which also Signorelli's \"Triumph of Chastity\" once\r\ndecorated (now 910 in our Gallery).\r\n\r\n\r\n912, 913, 914. THE STORY OF GRISELDA.\r\n\r\n  Umbrian School: 15th-16th century.\r\n\r\nOn these three panels (formerly ascribed to Pinturicchio),[195] which\r\nwere probably destined to serve as decorations to a chest, the story\r\nof Griselda is told with much naïve awkwardness of drawing, but also\r\nwith much naïve playfulness of incident. The story, told in Boccaccio's\r\n_Decameron_, and by Petrarch, is also to be found in Chaucer's _Clerkes\r\nTale_.\r\n\r\nIn the first picture (912) we see (1) on the extreme left the Marquis\r\nof Saluzzo, who is out hunting with a great retinue. He meets Griselda,\r\na peasant girl, who is drawing water at the well, and falls in love\r\nwith her. Next (2) on the extreme right is her humble barn-like\r\ndwelling, with the marquis serenading his love from below. (3) He\r\ncarries her off with him; and note how Griselda, who is to be modest\r\nand humble to the end, hangs her head in \"maiden shamefacedness.\" (4)\r\nThen the marquis has her attired in gold and fine linen, fit for a\r\nprince's bride. Her pattens and perhaps her garters are lying discarded\r\nbeside her. And so (5), in the centre of the picture, all is ready for\r\nthe wedding:\r\n\r\n    This markis hath hir spoused with a ring\r\n    Brought for the same cause, and then hir sette\r\n    Upon an hors, snow-whyt and wel ambling.\r\n\r\nBefore the second act (913) a few years are supposed to have elapsed.\r\n(1) On the left Griselda's two children--a boy and a girl--(in the\r\nlikeness of two very wooden dolls) are being carried off, as if by a\r\nvillain in a transpontine tragedy. They are supposed to have since\r\ndied miserably. (2) The marquis tires of his love for Griselda, and\r\nis divorced: in the centre of the picture we see her giving back the\r\nwedding ring. (3) Then she is stripped of her fine clothes, and (4)\r\nsent away to her father's house, but\r\n\r\n    \"The smok,\" quod he, \"that thou hast on thy bak,\r\n    Lat it be stille, and ber it forth with thee.\"\r\n\r\nTwo young gallants, in absurd attitudes, look on in half-pitying\r\namusement, while nearer to us two serving-men are disgusted at the\r\ncruel shame. (5) On the extreme right she is at home again, tending, as\r\nbefore, her father's sheep.\r\n\r\nIn the last act (914), a grand banquet is prepared for the marquis's\r\nsecond wedding, and Griselda is sent for to the castle to do menial\r\nwork. On the left we see her sweeping; on the right she is waiting at\r\ntable. Then, on the left again, it is discovered that the marquis's new\r\nbride is none other than Griselda's long-lost daughter, accompanied by\r\nher brother. They had all the while been tended in a distant city with\r\nthe utmost care. Griselda is thereupon affectionately embraced by her\r\nhusband, publicly reinstated in her proper position, and presented to\r\nall the court as a model of wifely obedience and patience--\r\n\r\n    No wedded man so hardy be tassaille\r\n    His wyues pacience, in hope to fynde\r\n    Grisildes, for in certein he shal faille!\r\n    O noble wyues, ful of heigh prudènce,\r\n    Lat non humilitee your tongë naille.\r\n\r\n\r\n915. MARS AND VENUS.\r\n\r\n  _Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510). _See 1034._\r\n\r\nSo the picture is usually called--Mars, the God of War, asleep, and\r\nthe young satyrs playing with his discarded armour, while one of\r\nthem attempts to rouse him by blowing a shell. The subject is almost\r\nidentical with that which Spenser draws in the _Faërie Queene_, where\r\nSir Guyon, the Knight of Purity, overthrows the Bower of Bliss in which\r\nAcrasia (or Pleasure) dwells--the last and worst of Sir Guyon's trials,\r\nfor \"it is harder to fight against pleasure than against pain.\" Note\r\nespecially the expression of the sleeping youth: he is overcome with\r\nbrutish paralysis, and they cannot awaken him. Note also the swarm of\r\nhornets issuing from the tree-trunk by his head--significant of the\r\npower that sensual indulgence has of venomously wounding. Visitors who\r\nhave been in Venice may remember similar details in Carpaccio's picture\r\nof St. George and the Dragon (J. R. Anderson in _St. Mark's Rest_,\r\nSecond Supplement, p. 20).\r\n\r\n      Upon a bed of Roses she was layd,\r\n    As faint through heat, or dight to pleasant sin;\r\n    And was arrayd, or rather disarrayd,\r\n    All in a vele of silke and silver thin,\r\n    That hid no whit her alabaster skin ...\r\n      The young man, sleeping by her, seemd to be\r\n    Some goodly swayne of honorable place,\r\n    That certes it great pitty was to see\r\n    Him his nobility so fowle deface ...\r\n      His warlike armes, the ydle instruments\r\n    Of sleeping praise, were hong upon a tree ...\r\n    Ne for them ne for honour cared hee,\r\n    Ne ought that did to his advauncement tend;\r\n    But in lewd loves, and wastfull luxuree,\r\n    His dayes, his goods, his bodie, he did spend:\r\n    O horrible enchantment, that him so did blend!\r\n\r\n  _Faërie Queene_, bk. ii. 12, §§ lxxvii.-lxxx.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by Dr. Richter that the subject of the picture\r\nis not mythological, but an illustration of Angelo Poliziano's poem,\r\n\"Stanze per la Giostra,\" \"The Song of the Tournament,\" written in 1476\r\nin glorification of Giuliano de' Medici, who had entered the lists in\r\nthe preceding year, at the tournament given in honour of Simonetta\r\nCattaneo. In this poem, Giuliano appears as a youth enamoured of the\r\nchase, and contemptuous of women. Cupid determines that he shall fall\r\na prey to a pair of lovely eyes, and leads him to the presence of\r\nSimonetta. But night falls and Simonetta vanishes, whereupon Venus\r\nsends Giuliano a dream in which he is exhorted to enter the lists in\r\nhonour of his lady-love. He foreknows that victory will crown his\r\narms, and that love will reward his valour, but these joyful tidings\r\nare black with the shadow of death, for early in 1476 Simonetta died.\r\nAccording to Dr. Richter's interpretation, Giuliano in the picture\r\nbefore us lies sunk in deepest sleep. The little satyrs are whispering\r\ndreams into his ears, dreams from the realms of Venus. In his dreams,\r\nGiuliano is overcome with fear, because his lady is clad in the armour\r\nof Pallas: he cannot brook the gleam of her helmet and her lance. But\r\nCupid whispers: \"Lift thine eyes, Giuliano, to that flame which with\r\nits radiance blinds thee like a sun; for she it is who quickens noble\r\nminds, and from the breast all evil thoughts expels.\" He dreams again;\r\na goddess comes to his aid leading him to battle and to victory. She\r\ndivests his lady of the armour of Pallas, and leaves her robed in white\r\n(_Lectures on the National Gallery_, p. 51). The poem[196] may thus be\r\nmade to fit the picture. It may, however, be questioned whether the\r\naction of the little Cupids is not more appropriate to the accepted\r\ntheory which sees in the armour the discarded weapons of a Mars or a\r\nknight, and Count Plunkett (_Sandro Botticelli_, pp. 44-5) refers to\r\na passage in Lucian, with whose dialogues Botticelli was familiar.\r\nIn describing a picture by Aëtion of the \"Nuptials of Alexander and\r\nRoxana,\" Lucian describes how \"on one side of it little Cupids play\r\namong Alexander's armour; two are carrying his spear, as porters do a\r\nheavy beam; two more grasp the handles of a shield, tugging it along\r\nwith another reclining on it ... and then another has got into the\r\nbreastplate.... All this is not idle fancy, on which the painter has\r\nbeen lavishing needless pains; he is hinting that Alexander has also\r\nanother love, in War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n916. VENUS WITH CUPIDS.\r\n\r\n  _School of Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510). _See 1034._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThe expression of melancholy characteristic of Botticelli's Madonnas\r\nis not absent from his heathen goddesses either. Notice also the\r\nroses--the painter's favourite flower (see 226). This picture is\r\nprobably only a work of his school; the figure of the goddess is a\r\nnot very successful repetition of the one in 915. The subject of the\r\npicture recalls the description of Simonetta in Poliziano's poem:--\r\n\r\n    White is the maid, and white the robe around her,\r\n      With buds and roses and thin grasses pied;\r\n    Enwreathèd folds of golden tresses crowned her,\r\n      Shadowing her forehead fair with modest pride;\r\n    The wild wood smiled; the thicket, where he found her,\r\n      To ease his anguish, bloomed on every side:\r\n    Serene she sits, with gesture queenly mild,\r\n      And with her brow tempers the tempests wild.\r\n\r\n  SYMONDS's Translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n920. ORPHEUS.\r\n\r\n  _Roelandt Savery_ (Dutch: 1576-1639).\r\n\r\n      Savery, a painter of Courtrai, was instructed by his brother\r\n      at Amsterdam. His works show the influence of Jan Breughel.\r\n      He visited France in the reign of Henry IV., by whom he was\r\n      employed in the royal palaces. He was subsequently invited to\r\n      Prague by the Emperor Rudolph II., in whose service he spent\r\n      several years.\r\n\r\nA not very poetical rendering of the poetical legend of the power of\r\nmusic:--\r\n\r\n    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,\r\n    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze\r\n    By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet\r\n    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;\r\n    Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,\r\n    But music for the time doth change his nature.\r\n\r\n  _Merchant of Venice_, Act v. Sc. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n923. A VENETIAN SENATOR.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Solario_ (Lombard: about 1460-1520). _See 734._\r\n\r\nThis picture \"was ascribed to Giovanni Bellini before it entered the\r\nNational Gallery, and _dilettanti_ might well mistake it for a work of\r\nAntonello da Messina. There seems to be little doubt that the picture\r\nwas painted by Solario at Venice, where he went in 1490 in company of\r\nhis brother.... The firmly drawn portrait of the senator, with its\r\nminutely executed landscape in the background, reveals plainly that he\r\nthere became an ardent follower of Antonello\" (Richter's _Italian Art\r\nin the National Gallery_, p. 99).\r\n\r\n\r\n924. A GOTHIC INTERIOR\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Neeffs_ (Flemish: 1577-about 1661).\r\n\r\n      This eminent architectural painter belonged to a family of\r\n      Antwerp artists. He was a pupil of Hendrick Steenwyck the\r\n      elder. \"He did for the Roman Catholic churches of Antwerp that\r\n      which, thirty years later, and with greater talent, a more\r\n      flowing brush, and a better understanding of chiaro-oscuro,\r\n      Emmanuel de Witte (see 1053) was destined to do for the\r\n      Protestant churches of Delft. Neeffs took special delight\r\n      in the representation of night scenes, torchlight funeral\r\n      services, and the like. Teniers and Velvet Breughel themselves\r\n      often assisted him in these small canvases, thus bearing\r\n      testimony to the high esteem in which Neeffs was held by his\r\n      colleagues\" (Wauters, _The Flemish School_, p. 342.)\r\n\r\nA group of figures is inspecting a conspicuous Renaissance tomb. Notice\r\nthe dogs among the visitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n927. AN ANGEL ADORING.\r\n\r\n  _Filippino Lippi_ (Florentine: 1457-1504). _See 293._\r\n\r\n    And with the morn those angel faces smile,\r\n    Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.\r\n\r\n  CARDINAL NEWMAN.\r\n\r\nThis exquisite fragment once belonged to Sir Augustus Callcott, R.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n928. APOLLO AND DAPHNE.\r\n\r\n  Ascribed to _Pollajuolo_ (Florentine: 1429-1498). _See 292._\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, seeing the perpetual verdure of the laurel, personified\r\nit in the story of Apollo and Daphne (= laurel), which told how the\r\nsun-god was enamoured of her. But she, praying to be delivered from\r\nhis pursuit, was changed by the gods into a laurel--her two arms are\r\nhere sprouting, just as the god has caught her in his embrace; and he,\r\ncrowning his head with the leaves, ordained that the tree should for\r\never bloom and be sacred to his divinity (see further for the story of\r\nApollo and Daphne under 520). The fact that Phoebus Apollo was also\r\nthe god of song has suggested a pretty adaptation of the legend to the\r\ncase of poets who sing for love and earn the laurel wreath--\r\n\r\n    Yet, what he sung in his immortal strain,\r\n    Though unsuccessful, was not sung in vain:\r\n    All, but the Nymph that should redress his wrong,\r\n    Attend his passion and approve his song.\r\n    Like Phoebus thus, acquiring unsought praise,\r\n    He catched at love, and filled his arms with bays.\r\n\r\n  WALLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n929. THE \"BRIDGEWATER MADONNA.\"\r\n\r\n  _Copy after Raphael._ _See under 1171._\r\n\r\nThis is an ancient copy, probably by a Flemish painter, of the\r\noriginal, which is in the possession of the Earl of Ellesmere at\r\nBridgewater House. It belongs to Raphael's second or Florentine period,\r\nand its exquisite grace has caused it to be known by some writers as\r\n\"La Plus Belle des Vierges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n930. THE GARDEN OF LOVE.\r\n\r\n  _School of Giorgione_ (Venetian: 16th century). _See 269._\r\n\r\nCertainly not by Giorgione,[197] but a characteristic example\r\nof a class of composition of which, as we have seen, he was the\r\ninventor--one of those Venetian pastorals in which young men and women\r\n\"disport in the open air, amuse themselves at random\" (_Asolando_).\r\n\r\n\r\n931. THE MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Veronese_ (Veronese: 1528-1588). _See 26._\r\n\r\nThe Magdalen--she who had sinned much, but who was forgiven because\r\nshe loved much--is represented at the Saviour's feet, laying aside her\r\njewels, and thus renouncing the vanities of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n932. A KNIGHT OF MALTA.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Italian: 16th century).\r\n\r\nFormerly ascribed to Sebastiano del Piombo.\r\n\r\n\r\n933. BOY WITH A BIRD.\r\n\r\n  _Padovanino_ (Venetian: 1590-1650). _See 70._\r\n\r\nContrast with this child caressing a dove Baroccio's Christ teasing\r\na bird. Padovanino lived much at Venice, and shared perhaps the\r\nVenetian's fondness for pigeons--the sacred birds of St. Mark's, which\r\nare kept and fed in the great square to this day at the public charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n934. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Carlo Dolci_ (Florentine: 1616-1686).\r\n\r\n      Carlo Dolci, the son of a Florentine tailor, is, like his\r\n      contemporary Sassoferrato, a good instance of the affected\r\n      religious school described in our introduction to the\r\n      Later Italian Schools. He was of a very retiring and pious\r\n      disposition, much given, we are told, to melancholy. Every one\r\n      who looks first at the pictures of similar subjects by earlier\r\n      Italian artists will be struck by something sentimental and\r\n      effeminate in Dolci's conceptions. Similarly in his execution\r\n      there is an over-smoothness and softness, corresponding to\r\n      \"polished\" language in literature (see _Modern Painters_, vol.\r\n      iii. pt. iv. ch. ix. § 7). In the Dulwich Gallery is a St.\r\n      Catherine of Siena which is one of Dolci's _chefs d'oeuvre_.\r\n\r\n\r\n935. A RIVER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Salvator Rosa_ (Neapolitan: 1615-1673). _See 84._\r\n\r\n\r\n936. THE FARNESE THEATRE, PARMA.\r\n\r\n  _Ferdinando Bibiena_ (Bolognese: 1657-1743).\r\n\r\n      Ferdinando Galli, called Bibiena, was one of a family of\r\n      artists who came from a place of that name in the Bolognese\r\n      State. He was a celebrated architect and scenic artist. He\r\n      was engaged at many of the European courts in the arrangement\r\n      of state pageants. He executed several works for Ranuccio\r\n      Farnese, Duke of Parma. His architectural and perspective views\r\n      are to be seen in the principal galleries in Italy. In these\r\n      the figures are usually painted by his brother Francesco.\r\n      Ferdinando, who published several works on architecture, became\r\n      blind in his old age.\r\n\r\nA scene in the theatre with _Othello_ being played. The pit is\r\nunseated; it is a kind of \"promenade play.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n937. VENICE: SCUOLA DI SAN ROCCO.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_[198] (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See 127._\r\n\r\nThe principal building is the Scuola of the religious fraternity of St.\r\nRoch--\"an interesting building of the early Renaissance (1517), passing\r\ninto Roman Renaissance,\" and, \"as regards the pictures it contains (by\r\nTintoret), one of the three most precious buildings in Italy\" (_Stones\r\nof Venice_, Venetian Index). From the adjoining Church of St. Roch, the\r\nHoly Thursday procession of the Doges and Officers of State, together\r\nwith the members of the Fraternity, is advancing under an awning on\r\nits way to St. Mark's. Notice the carpets hung out of the windows--a\r\nstanding feature, this, in Venetian gala decorations from very early\r\ntimes (see, for instance, No. 739).[199] Notice, also, the pictures\r\ndisplayed in the open air--a feature which well illustrates the\r\ndifference between the later \"easel pictures\" and the earlier pictures\r\nintended to serve as architectural decorations. \"A glance at this\r\npicture is sufficient to show how utterly the ordinary oil painting\r\nfails when employed as an architectural embellishment. Pictures which\r\nwere to adorn and form part of a building had to consist of figures,\r\nseparated one from another, all standing in simple and restful\r\nattitudes, and all plainly relieved against a light ground\" (Conway:\r\n_Early Flemish Artists_, p. 270). Apart from one of the conditions of\r\nearly art thus suggested, the picture is interesting as showing how in\r\nthe eighteenth century in Italy, as in the thirteenth, art was part and\r\nparcel of the life of the people. Cimabue's pictures were carried in\r\nprocession; and here in Canaletto's we see Venetian \"old masters\" hung\r\nout to assist in the popular rejoicing.\r\n\r\n\r\n938. VENICE: REGATTA ON THE GRAND CANAL.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See 127._\r\n\r\nA state regatta--a pastime which owes its origin to Venice--in honour\r\nof the visit to the city of the King of Denmark in 1709. In the centre\r\nof the canal are the gondoliers, racing; to the sides are moored the\r\nspectators, the gala barges of the nobles conspicuous amongst them.\r\nThe variegated building on the left is a temporary pavilion for the\r\ndistribution of prizes. These regattas at Venice took the place of our\r\nroyal processions here. \"Wherever the eye turned, it beheld a vast\r\nmultitude at doorways, on the quays, and even on the roofs. Some of the\r\nspectators occupied scaffoldings erected at favourable points along the\r\nsides of the canal; and the patrician ladies did not disdain to leave\r\ntheir palaces, and, entering their gondolas, lose themselves among the\r\ninfinite number of the boats\" (_Feste Veneziane_: quoted in Howells's\r\n_Venetian Life_, ii. 69). Another custom in which we have begun to\r\nimitate the Venetians, and which may be seen in this picture, is that\r\nof hanging out carpets and stuffs by way of decorations. \"The windows\r\nand balconies,\" says the same account, \"were decked with damasks,\r\nstuffs of the Levant, tapestries, and velvets;\" a very old Venetian\r\ncustom: see under 937.\r\n\r\n\r\n939, 940. VENICE: THE PIAZZETTA, AND THE DUCAL PALACE.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See 127._\r\n\r\nCanaletto's representation of the central spot of Venice. In 939 is\r\nthe Piazzetta, the little Piazza or square, in front the church of\r\nSt. Mark, with its bell towers; on the left are the mint and library;\r\non the right is the ducal palace. This appears again in 940, with the\r\nfamous column of St. Mark, patron saint of Venice, while beyond it is\r\nthe Ponte della Paglia, the prisons, and the Riva degli Schiavoni.\r\n\r\n\r\n941. VENICE: THE GRIMANI PALACE.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See 127._\r\n\r\nThis palace, situated on the Grand Canal and used until lately as the\r\npost-office, was built in the sixteenth century by San Micheli, and is\r\n\"the principal type at Venice, and one of the best in Europe, of the\r\ncentral architecture of the Renaissance schools--that carefully studied\r\nand perfectly executed architecture to which those schools owe their\r\nprincipal claim to our respect, and which became the model of most of\r\nthe important works subsequently produced by civilised nations.... It\r\nis composed of three stories of the Corinthian order (_i.e._ in which\r\nthe ornament is concave, distinguished from Doric, in which it is\r\nconvex), at once simple, delicate, and sublime; but on so colossal a\r\nscale that the three-storied palaces on its right and left only reach\r\nto the cornice which marks the level of its first floor\" (_Stones of\r\nVenice_, vol. iii. ch. ii. §§ 1, 2). Buildings in the same style in\r\nLondon are St. Paul's and Whitehall.\r\n\r\n\r\n942. ETON COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See under 127._\r\n\r\nPainted during the artist's first English visit, 1746-1748, perhaps in\r\nthe same year (1747) that Gray published his well-known ode--\r\n\r\n    Ye distant spires, ye antique towers\r\n      That crown the watery glade,\r\n    Where grateful Science still adores\r\n      Her Henry's holy shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n943. A PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThis portrait, which is dated 1462, was formerly supposed to be\r\nMemlinc's portrait of himself, in the costume of the Hospital of St.\r\nJohn at Bruges, but is now called by others Bouts's own portrait. \"It\r\nis,\" says Sir W. Armstrong (_Notes on the National Gallery_, p. 28),\r\n\"pretty surely the work of Dirck Bouts. Compare it with the Madonna\r\nnumbered 774, and ascribed to Van der Goes. In conception, in chord\r\nof colour, in technical manner, the similarity is so complete between\r\nthem as to leave room, in my mind, for very little doubt as to the\r\nidentity of their authors. And this Madonna is by Dirck Bouts, as no\r\none who has examined his 'Last Supper' in the Church of St. Pierre at\r\nLouvain can doubt.... Sir Martin Conway, who was the first, I fancy, to\r\nrecognise Bouts in all three of these pictures, drew my attention to a\r\ncurious peculiarity of his: he goes out of his way to paint hands. In\r\nhis 'Last Supper' many hands are displayed that might quite naturally\r\nhave been hidden, and we find the same thing in this portrait.\" Whether\r\nof Memlinc or of Bouts, the face bespeaks a gentle, humble, pious,\r\nlaborious soul. The painting of the hair is especially remarkable.\r\nIt is touched with the utmost minuteness, and yet the silky, flowing\r\ntexture is conveyed with the utmost freedom. This picture was formerly\r\nin the possession of Samuel Rogers.\r\n\r\n\r\n944. TWO USURERS.\r\n\r\n  _Marinus van Romerswael_ (Flemish: about 1497-1573).\r\n\r\n      Marinus of Romerswael (his birthplace), also called \"de Zeeuw\"\r\n      (the Zeelander), was fond of this subject, the composition of\r\n      which he seems to have borrowed from Quentin Metsys, by whom\r\n      also similar pictures are common. In early life Marinus was\r\n      apprenticed to a glass-painter at Antwerp. Nothing is known of\r\n      his later life till towards its close, when he was residing\r\n      at Middelburg. \"There, in 1566, in an iconoclastic outburst\r\n      of the populace, the churches of the town were wrecked; and\r\n      Marinus was accused before the tribunals of taking part in the\r\n      spoliation of the Westmonsterkerk. Being held guilty, he was\r\n      condemned on the 25th of June 1567 to perform an ignominious\r\n      public penance and to be banished from Middelburg for the\r\n      space of six years. An aged man then, he can scarcely have\r\n      survived his term of exile\" (see authorities cited in the\r\n      Official Catalogue).\r\n\r\nOne inserts items in a ledger; the other puzzles over the particulars\r\nof some business transaction. It is a powerful realisation of what\r\nRuskin calls the New Beatitude, \"Blessed are the merciless, for they\r\nshall obtain money.\" \"The picture is remarkable,\" says Sir Edward\r\nPoynter, \"not only for its marvellous finish, and the energy of the\r\nexpressions, but for its luminous quality and the purity of the colour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n945. ST. AGNES ADORING.\r\n\r\n  _Joachim Patinir_ (Early Flemish: died 1524). _See 715._\r\n\r\nSt. Agnes, the young martyr virgin,--attired as a\r\n\r\n      Pensive nun, devout and pure,\r\n    Sober, steadfast, and demure,--\r\n\r\nkneels before the infant Christ, \"for knowest thou not that Agnes has\r\nbeen a Christian from her infancy upwards, and the husband to whom she\r\nis betrothed is no other than Jesus Christ?\" The infant Christ holds a\r\ncoral rosary in his hand, for he would crown her with jewels compared\r\nwith which all earthly gifts are as dross. \"It chanced that the son of\r\nthe prefect of Rome beheld her one day as he rode through the city,\r\nand became violently enamoured, and desired to have her for his wife.\r\nHe asked her in marriage of her parents, but the maiden repelled all\r\nhis advances. Then he brought rich presents, bracelets of gold and\r\ngems, and rare jewels and precious ornaments, and promised her all the\r\ndelights of the world if she would consent to be his wife. But she\r\nrejected him and his gifts, saying, Away from me, tempter! for I am\r\nalready betrothed to a lover who is greater and fairer than any earthly\r\nsuitor. To him I have pledged my faith, and he will crown me with\r\njewels, compared to which thy gifts are dross\" (MRS. JAMESON: _Sacred\r\nand Legendary Art_, p. 356.)\r\n\r\n\r\n946. A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Mabuse_ (Flemish: about 1470-1541). _See 656._\r\n\r\nOn the back of this picture is the brand of Charles I., a crown with C.\r\nR.\r\n\r\n\r\n947. A PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish School).\r\n\r\nFormerly hung with the French pictures. Now ascribed to the Flemish\r\nSchool of the 15th or early 16th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n948. LANDSCAPE: A SKETCH.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See_ 38.\r\n\r\n\r\n949. LANDSCAPE WITH GIPSIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n950. VILLAGE GOSSIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n951. THE GAME OF BOWLS.\r\n\r\n  _David Teniers, the elder_ (Flemish: 1582-1649).\r\n\r\n      This artist is less memorable for his own works, which are\r\n      mediocre, than as the founder of a family of painters (see\r\n      Wauters: _The Flemish School_, p. 299), and the father of the\r\n      celebrated David Teniers (the younger). He was a member of\r\n      the Antwerp Guild of Painters, but spent ten years at Rome,\r\n      where he came under the influence of Adam Elsheimer. The elder\r\n      Teniers was the master of his son, who carried on his style,\r\n      so that it is not always easy to distinguish their several\r\n      pictures. In their own time father and son were equally\r\n      appreciated. There is a large number of works by the elder\r\n      Teniers in the Dulwich Gallery. On the whole they are browner\r\n      in tone than those of the younger painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n952. \"THE VILLAGE FÊTE.\"\r\n\r\n  _David Teniers_ (Flemish: 1610-1694). _See_ 154.\r\n\r\nSo the picture is usually called, but the subject seems rather to be\r\na pilgrimage to some holy shrine or miraculous well. A cross is seen\r\non the right; the priest in charge of the pilgrimage stands somewhat\r\nlower down; on the left is a man selling little memorial flags with\r\ncrosses on them. The hungry travellers are waiting for the meal which\r\nis being prepared for them in several huge cauldrons. The town of\r\nAntwerp is seen in the distance. This picture, dated 1643, is among the\r\nbest works of Teniers, and includes 150 figures. \"Truth in physiognomy,\r\ndistribution of groups, the beautiful effect of light and shade,\r\ncommand,\" says Hymans, \"our warmest admiration.\" In the foreground are\r\nTeniers and his party, with his little boy leading a greyhound, and the\r\ngirl of this party is almost the only pleasant face in the picture.\r\nThe painter, one begins to suspect, had not much real sympathy with\r\nhis \"village scenes\" after all; and perhaps the demand for such scenes\r\non the part of his aristocratic patrons was only a kind of vicarious\r\n\"slumming\"--an anticipation of the fashionable craze of a later age.\r\n\r\n\r\n953. THE TOPER.\r\n\r\n  _David Teniers_ (Flemish: 1610-1694). _See 154._\r\n\r\nThis picture is signed with a T. within a D., which is the signature of\r\nthe elder Teniers.\r\n\r\n    But, lo, a Teniers woos, and not in vain,\r\n    Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:\r\n    His bell-mouth'd goblet makes one feel quite Danish,\r\n    Or Dutch, with thirst--what, ho! a flask of Rhenish.--BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n954. A LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelis Huysmans_ (Flemish: 1648-1727).\r\n\r\n      This painter, whose pictures have for the most part become very\r\n      dark, was born at Antwerp, the son of an architect. He studied\r\n      the art of landscape under Jacques d'Arthois at Brussels, by\r\n      which master we are told he was kept so closely to drawing that\r\n      he could only practise painting by night. He took up his abode\r\n      at Mechlin; but in 1702 removed to Antwerp, returning, however,\r\n      to Mechlin fourteen years later.

WOMEN BATHING.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelis van Poelenburgh_ (Dutch: 1586-1667).\r\n\r\n      This painter was a native of Utrecht, where he studied under\r\n      A. Bloemaert. He afterwards visited Italy and Rome, where he\r\n      was in 1617, and where he studied the works of Elsheimer.\r\n      He generally painted Italian landscapes, which he peopled\r\n      with nude figures, goddesses, nymphs bathing, or antique\r\n      shepherdesses. These works hit the taste of Royal and Grand\r\n      Ducal patrons throughout Europe. On quitting Rome for Florence,\r\n      he was employed by the Grand Duke. In 1627 he returned to\r\n      Utrecht, whither his fame had preceded him. Rubens is said to\r\n      have visited him, and Van Dyck painted his portrait. He was\r\n      invited also to London, and was employed both by Charles I.\r\n      and James II. He was on three occasions appointed Dean of the\r\n      Painters' Guild at Utrecht, where he died. He frequently helped\r\n      his fellow landscape painters by inserting figures for them.\r\n      Those in Both's \"Judgment of Paris\" (No. 209) are by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n956.

A BATTLE.\r\n\r\n  _Wouwerman_ (Dutch: 1619-1668). _See 878._\r\n\r\nIn Wouwerman's battle-pieces, says Ruskin, there is \"nothing but animal\r\nrage and cowardice\"--with which he contrasts the noble battle-piece by\r\nPaolo Uccello (583). \"It is very singular,\" he adds, \"that unmitigated\r\nexpressions of cowardice in battle should be given by the painters of\r\nso brave a nation as the Dutch. Not but that it is possible enough\r\nfor a coward to be stubborn, and a brave man weak; the one may win his\r\nbattle by blind persistence, and the other lose it by a thoughtful\r\nvacillation. Nevertheless, the want of all expression of resoluteness\r\nin Dutch battle-pieces remains, for the present, a mystery to me. In\r\nthose of Wouwerman, it is only a natural development of his perfect\r\nvulgarity in all respects\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch.\r\nviii. §§ 8-10).\r\n\r\n\r\n977.

FLOWERS, INSECTS, AND FRUIT.\r\n\r\n  _Jacob Walscappelle_ (Dutch: painted about 1675).\r\n\r\n      A painter of fruit and flowers in the style of de Heem. His\r\n      flowers are generally arranged in water-bottles, and are\r\n      besprinkled with butterflies and other insects. He painted at\r\n      Amsterdam from about 1667 to 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\n1003. DEAD PARTRIDGES AND OTHER BIRDS.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Fyt_ (Flemish: 1611-1661).\r\n\r\n      Fyt--painter and etcher of animals--was a pupil of Snyders,\r\n      whom in some respects he excelled. The sale catalogues of the\r\n      greater part of the nineteenth century show that his works\r\n      were little appreciated, but recent criticism has given him a\r\n      very high place among the animal and still-life painters of\r\n      his country. \"Fyt's work,\" says Sir F. Burton, \"is perfect in\r\n      its kind, exhibiting the finest observation of nature, and an\r\n      execution which unites the greatest mastery with the utmost\r\n      delicacy. His composition is unconstrained, and the colouring\r\n      and tone of his pictures are most pleasing.\" He was born at\r\n      Antwerp, where, after some years' residence in Italy, he became\r\n      Dean of the Painters' Guild.\r\n\r\n\r\n1004. AN ITALIAN LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Berchem_ (Dutch: 1620-1683). _See 78._\r\n\r\n\r\n1005. PLOUGHING.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Berchem_ (Dutch: 1620-1683). _See 78._\r\n\r\n\"There is in this small picture,\" says Sir Edward Poynter, \"a genuine\r\nfeeling for nature, which is generally somewhat wanting in the works\r\nof Berchem, whose manner, founded on the study of Italian landscape\r\nart, gives frequently an artificial effect to his composition\"\r\n(_National Gallery_, i. 44).\r\n\r\n\r\n1006. HURDY-GURDY.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Berchem_ (Dutch: 1620-1683). _See 78._\r\n\r\nBerchem, as we have seen, was an \"Italianiser,\" and here introduces us\r\nto one of the exports of that country--\r\n\r\n    Far from England, in the sunny\r\n      South, where Anio leaps in foam,\r\n    Thou wast reared, till lack of money\r\n      Drew thee from thy vine-clad home.\r\n\r\n  CALVERLEY: _Fly Leaves_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1007. A ROCKY LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Wils_ (Dutch: about 1600-1670).\r\n\r\n      Wils, whose pictures are seldom met with, \"would appear, from\r\n      the style of most of his works, to have studied under Jan\r\n      Both at Utrecht.... He was the father-in-law and one of the\r\n      teachers of Nicolas Berchem, between whose works and some of\r\n      those of Wils (as, for instance, the present picture) a great\r\n      resemblance may be traced\" (Official Catalogue).\r\n\r\nThe figures in this picture are supposed to have been put in by\r\nWouwerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n1008. A STAG HUNT.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Potter_ (Dutch: 1597-1652).\r\n\r\n      Pieter Potter, the father of Paul Potter, was a native of\r\n      Enkhuizen, and originally painted on glass. In one of his early\r\n      signatures (1628) he describes himself as \"glass annealer,\r\n      also painter.\" Later on, he settled at Amsterdam and was\r\n      director of a manufactory of gilt leather there. He formed his\r\n      style, we are told, under the influence of Frans Hals, and\r\n      painted various subjects, such as scenes in the guard-house,\r\n      still-life, and landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n1009. THE OLD GRAY HUNTER.\r\n\r\n  _Paul Potter_ (Dutch: 1625-1654). _See 849._\r\n\r\n\r\n1010. RENAISSANCE ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n  _Dirk van Delen_ (Dutch: 1607-1673).\r\n\r\n      This painter was born at Heusden. He lived at Arnemuiden in\r\n      Zealand, of which town he was burgomaster. He worked also at\r\n      Haarlem, Delft, and Antwerp.\r\n\r\nA picture by a rare master--interesting to students of the history\r\nof architectural taste. In 992 we are shown the struggle between the\r\nold Gothic style and the new Renaissance architecture; here we see\r\nthe full victory of the latter. Dirk van Delen loved to depict the\r\ncostly and variegated marbles on splendid palaces in the style of the\r\nlate Renaissance. He will not be defrauded, even by considerations of\r\ndistance, of any of his details, and every statue and ornament is shown\r\nus as minutely as if it were on the level of the eye. The classical\r\nstyle has pervaded too the fountain; note the gilt bronze group of\r\nHercules and the Hydra.\r\n\r\n\r\n1011. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Coques_ (Flemish: 1618-1684). _See 821._\r\n\r\nA faithful imitation on a reduced scale of Van Dyck's ideal of\r\nfeminine \"elegance.\" There is a certain artificial simplicity very\r\ncharacteristic of the time, in the combination of the lady, with her\r\nsumptuous white satin and the elaborate architecture behind her, and\r\nher pet lamb.\r\n\r\n\r\n1012. PORTRAIT OF A MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Matthew Merian, the younger_ (Swiss: 1621-1687).\r\n\r\n      This painter was the son of Matthew Merian, the elder, an\r\n      eminent Swiss draughtsman and engraver. The father had\r\n      established himself at Frankfort as a book and print seller,\r\n      and on his death in 1650, the son assumed management of the\r\n      business, and continued the publication of the \"Theatrum\r\n      Europæum,\" for which he arranged several plates. But the\r\n      younger Merian was best known as a painter. He was born at\r\n      Bâle, and at the age of 14 came to Frankfort, where he learnt\r\n      to paint under Joachim van Sandrart, whom he accompanied to\r\n      Amsterdam in 1637 and to England in 1640. In this country he\r\n      came into friendly relations with Van Dyck, whom he took as\r\n      his model in the art of portraiture. Merian also travelled in\r\n      France and Italy. As a portrait-painter he was much patronised\r\n      by the German princes and also by the Emperor Leopold I. He\r\n      also painted religious and historical pictures, such as the\r\n      \"Martyrdom of St. Lawrence,\" for the high altar of Bamberg\r\n      Cathedral, and the \"Resurrection,\" in the Library of Bâle.\r\n\r\nThis picture was formerly ascribed to Van Dyck. The man's dress is of\r\nblack velvet, of the fashion of about 1665-70.\r\n\r\n\r\n1013. GEESE AND DUCKS.\r\n\r\n  _Melchior de Hondecoeter_ (Dutch: 1636-1695). _See 202._\r\n\r\n\r\n1014. THE MARTYRDOM OF ST. LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\n  _Adam Elsheimer_ (German: 1578-1620).\r\n\r\n      Elsheimer was the son of a tailor at Frankfort-on-Maine. He\r\n      himself settled in Rome. \"He inherited with his northern blood\r\n      an intense love of nature and her varied aspects. Upon this\r\n      he engrafted a careful study of the human form, and in Italy\r\n      he profited by the example of the great masters of preceding\r\n      generations. Thus, aided by a certain homely imagination, he\r\n      formed a style of his own, combining landscape and figure\r\n      in such a manner that each was the necessary complement of\r\n      the other, and that subject and situation were in perfect\r\n      harmony. The lonely, and at that time, wooded, depressions of\r\n      the Roman Campagna, and the hills of Albano and Tivoli, were\r\n      his favourite haunts, and in their scenery his imagination\r\n      placed events in biblical or mythological story. He loved\r\n      especially to paint the strange effects produced by diverse\r\n      sources of illumination. The novelty of his aims, the beauty\r\n      of his execution, and the geniality of his disposition,\r\n      gained him admirers and friends\" (Official Catalogue). His\r\n      contemporaries Sandrart and Cornelius de Bie describe him as\r\n      an extraordinary artist who had \"a peculiar manner of his\r\n      own. He was, indeed, the first who invented a style of small\r\n      sceneries, landscapes, and other curiosities.\" He possessed,\r\n      we are told, so extraordinary a memory, that it was sufficient\r\n      for him to have looked at an object or scene once to draw it\r\n      with the utmost precision. The extreme patience and labour with\r\n      which he finished his pictures were such that the prices he\r\n      received never sufficiently repaid him. Had he been paid but\r\n      a fourth part of what his works have since produced, he might\r\n      have lived in affluence instead of indigence and distress.\r\n      Elsheimer usually painted on copper (as is the case with this\r\n      picture). His etchings and drawings are well known; in the\r\n      Städel Institute of his native town there is a large collection\r\n      of them. There are also some in the British Museum. Elsheimer's\r\n      works had a considerable influence on many succeeding Dutch\r\n      painters. \"Elsheimer,\" says Mr. Colvin in his Guide to the\r\n      British Museum Drawings, \"fills a very important part in art as\r\n      the forerunner on the one hand of Claude and his group, by his\r\n      delight in the composition and massing of the forms of hill,\r\n      plain, and grove in the country round Rome, and on the other\r\n      hand of Rembrandt and _his_ group, by his predilection for\r\n      strong artificial contrasts of light, and for the dramatic and\r\n      speaking action of his figures.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Lawrence (for whose legend see 747) is being prepared for\r\nmartyrdom. Beside him there is an image of Cæsar, unto whom will be\r\nrendered Cæsar's due--the saint's life; but over his head is an angel\r\nfrom heaven, for unto God will go the saint's soul. The emperor is\r\ncrowned on earth; the angel brings the saint a palm branch, an earnest\r\nof the martyr's crown in heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n1015. FRUIT, FLOWERS, AND DEAD BIRDS.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Os_ (Dutch: 1744-1808).\r\n\r\n      Born at Middelharnis, a most distinguished flower-painter in\r\n      the manner of Van Huysum. He also painted marine pieces and\r\n      wrote poetry. His wife drew portraits in chalk, and his two\r\n      sons were painters.\r\n\r\nProminent amongst the flowers is the red cockscomb. A picture by the\r\nmost distinguished flower-painter of his time, and characteristic, in\r\nan interesting particular, of Dutch pictures of this kind generally.\r\n\"If the reader has any familiarity with the galleries of painting\r\nin the great cities of Europe, he cannot but retain a clear, though\r\nsomewhat monotonously calm, impression of the character of those\r\npolished flower-pieces, or still-life pieces, which occupy subordinate\r\ncorners, and invite to moments of repose, or frivolity, the attention\r\nand imagination which have been wearied in admiring the attitudes of\r\nheroism, and sympathising with the sentiments of piety. Recalling to\r\nhis memory the brightest examples of these ... he will find that all\r\nthe older ones agree--if flower-pieces--in a certain courtliness and\r\nformality of arrangement, implying that the highest honours which\r\nflowers can attain are in being wreathed into grace of garlands, or\r\nassembled in variegation of bouquets, for the decoration of beauty, or\r\nflattery of _noblesse_. If fruit or still-life pieces, they agree no\r\nless distinctly in directness of reference to the supreme hour when the\r\ndestiny of dignified fruit is to be accomplished in a royal dessert;\r\nand the furred and feathered life of hill and forest may bear witness\r\nto the Wisdom of Providence by its extinction for the kitchen dresser.\r\nIrrespectively of these ornamental virtues, and culinary utilities, the\r\npainter never seems to perceive any conditions of beauty in the things\r\nthemselves, which would make them worth regard for their own sake:\r\nnor, even in these appointed functions, are they ever supposed to be\r\nworth painting, unless the pleasures they procure be distinguished as\r\nthose of the most exalted society\" (_Notes on Prout and Hunt_, pp. 10,\r\n11, where Ruskin goes on to contrast with this Dutch ideal the simple\r\npleasure in the flowers and fruits for their own sake which marks W.\r\nHunt's still-life drawings).\r\n\r\nObserve, as further characteristic of Dutch fruit-pieces, the\r\nbutterfly, the fly, and the earwig: \"There was a further _tour de\r\nforce_ demanded of the Dutch workman, without which all his happiest\r\npreceding achievements would have been unacknowledged. Not only a\r\ndew-drop, but, in some depth of bell or cranny of leaf, a bee, or a\r\nfly, was necessary for the complete satisfaction of the connoisseur. In\r\nthe articulation of the fly's legs, or neurology of the bee's wings,\r\nthe genius of painting was supposed to signify her accepted disciples;\r\nand their work went forth to the European world, thenceforward, without\r\nquestion, as worthy of its age and country. But, without recognising\r\nin myself, or desiring to encourage in my scholars, any unreasonable\r\ndislike or dread of the lower orders of living creatures, I trust\r\nthat the reader will feel with me that none of Mr. Hunt's peaches or\r\nplums would be made daintier by the detection on them of even the most\r\ncunningly latent wasp, or cautiously rampant caterpillar; and will\r\naccept, without so much opposition as it met with forty years ago, my\r\nthen first promulgated, but steadily since repeated assertion, that the\r\n'modern painter' had in these matters less vanity than the ancient one,\r\nand better taste\" (_ib._ pp. 14, 15).\r\n\r\n\r\n1016. A PORTRAIT OF A GIRL.\r\n\r\n  _Sir Peter Lely_ (Dutch: 1617-1680).\r\n\r\n      Lely, the court painter of the reign of Charles II., by whom\r\n      he was knighted, was a native of Holland; his father's name\r\n      was Van der Vaes, but the son took the nickname of Le Lys or\r\n      Lely (from the lily with which the front of his father's house\r\n      was ornamented) as a surname. He was born in Westphalia, but\r\n      settled in England in 1641, the year of Van Dyck's death, on\r\n      whom he modelled his style. It was Lely who is said to have\r\n      painted Cromwell, \"warts and all,\" but he easily accommodated\r\n      himself to the softer manners of the Restoration. The rich\r\n      curls, the full lips, and the languishing eyes of the frail\r\n      beauties of Charles II. may be seen at Hampton Court. Lely\r\n      was \"a mighty proud man,\" says Pepys, \"and full of state.\"\r\n      The painting of great ladies was a lucrative business, and\r\n      his collection of drawings and pictures sold at his death for\r\n      £26,000, a sum which bore a greater proportion to the fortunes\r\n      of the rich men of that day than £100,000 would bear to the\r\n      fortunes of the rich men of our time. He was struck with\r\n      apoplexy while painting the Duchess of Somerset, and was buried\r\n      at St. Paul's, Covent Garden.\r\n\r\nThe courtly affectation which distinguishes Lely's portraits is not\r\nabsent from this little girl. She is feeding the parrot, but obviously\r\ntakes no interest in it--not even troubling indeed to look at it. Her\r\nconcern seems to be only to hold up her flowing frock (or \"simar\")\r\nprettily and to point her fingers gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n1017. A WOODY LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish: dated 1622).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThe landscape is probably by Josse Mompers, an Antwerp artist who lived\r\n1564-1635.\r\n\r\n\r\n1018. A CLASSICAL LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Claude Lorraine_ (French: 1600-1682). _See 2._\r\n\r\nA characteristic example of Claude's \"classical compositions\" as\r\ndescribed in our chapter on the French School. It is one of his late\r\nworks, being dated 1673; the names of Anchises and Æneas occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1019. THE HEAD OF A GIRL.\r\n\r\n  _Greuze_ (French: 1725-1805). _See 206._\r\n\r\n    I will paint her as I see her....\r\n    With a forehead fair and saintly,\r\n      Which two blue eyes under-shine,\r\n      Like meek prayers before a shrine.\r\n\r\n    Face and figure of a child,--\r\n      Though too calm, you think, and tender,\r\n      For the childhood you would lend her.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. BROWNING: _A Portrait_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1020. GIRL WITH AN APPLE.\r\n\r\n  _Greuze_ (French: 1725-1805). _See 206._\r\n\r\n    A cloud of yellow hair\r\n    Is round about her ear.\r\n    She hath a mouth of grace,\r\n    And forehead sweet and fair.\r\n\r\n  AUSTIN DOBSON: _A Song of Angiola_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1021. PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Frans Hals_ (Dutch: 1580-1666).\r\n\r\n      Among the Dutch portrait-painters, Hals stands second only to\r\n      Rembrandt, while for mastery of the brush he is second only\r\n      to Velazquez. Though born in Antwerp and a pupil of Karel van\r\n      Mander (the Flemish painter and biographer), Hals is claimed\r\n      as a member of the Dutch School, inasmuch as his father was\r\n      settled at Haarlem in Holland, and he himself lived and worked\r\n      there. In style, \"though his vigorous drawing recalls by its\r\n      boldness the masterly method of Rubens, his manner of giving\r\n      to his work a sustained light, his style of composition, and\r\n      the choice of his subject, place him unmistakably in the Dutch\r\n      School.... No one, either before or after him, ever attained\r\n      the marvellous exactness with which he places flesh tints in\r\n      juxtaposition, without their mixing together, just as they\r\n      come from the palette.... No artist ever manipulated his\r\n      brush with such firmness, freedom, and life. In consequence\r\n      of his extraordinary ability, Frans Hals has been called 'the\r\n      personification of painting'\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_,\r\n      p. 110). \"We prize in Rembrandt,\" says another critic, \"the\r\n      golden glow of effect based upon artificial contrast of low\r\n      light in immeasurable gloom. Hals was fond of daylight of\r\n      silvery sheen. Both men were painters of touch, but of touch\r\n      on different keys. Rembrandt was the bass, Hals the treble.\"\r\n      Rembrandt's portraits are the more profound, and there is in\r\n      them an intensity of pathetic realism which was beyond the\r\n      reach of Hals; but Hals seizes the brighter moments of lusty\r\n      life with a force and truth which have never been excelled.\r\n      Hals is best seen in the Haarlem Museum in a series of portrait\r\n      groups. Of his single portraits, No. 1251 in our Gallery is a\r\n      characteristic example, and at Hertford House is a famous and\r\n      charming picture, \"The Laughing Cavalier,\" which is full of\r\n      what Fromentin well calls \"the irresistible verve\" of Frans\r\n      Hals.\r\n\r\n      The life of Hals was irregular and improvident, but full also\r\n      of work and energy. At a time when the Dutch nation fought\r\n      for independence and won it, Hals appears in the ranks of\r\n      its military guilds. He was also a member of the Chamber\r\n      of Rhetoric, and president of the Painters' Corporation at\r\n      Haarlem. In 1610 he married, and five years later was summoned\r\n      before the magistrates for ill-treating his wife, and on that\r\n      occasion was severely reprimanded for his violent and drunken\r\n      habits. His first wife died prematurely, and he saved the\r\n      character of his second by marrying her in 1617. With her\r\n      he seems to have lived happily for nearly fifty years, and\r\n      they brought up a large family. Financial troubles, however,\r\n      befell the painter. In 1654 a forced sale of his pictures and\r\n      furniture at the suit of his baker brought him to penury. A few\r\n      years later we hear of the municipality paying his rent and\r\n      firing for him, and granting him a small annuity. His widow\r\n      had to seek outdoor relief from the guardians of the poor. His\r\n      four sons were all painters, and attained some distinction.\r\n      Several of the best Dutch painters--Van der Helst, A. van\r\n      Ostade, Metsu, Terburg, Steen, and others--were directly or\r\n      indirectly his scholars. In the Haarlem Museum there is a\r\n      picture by Job Berck-Heyde, dated 1652, of the studio in which\r\n      Frans Hals is surrounded by his sons and pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n1022. AN ITALIAN NOBLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Moroni_ (Bergamese: 1525-1578). _See 697._\r\n\r\nHis left foot appears to have been wounded, for it is attached by\r\na kind of stirrup and black cord to a band above the knee. It is\r\ninteresting to compare this portrait with the closely corresponding one\r\nby Moretto which hangs near it (1025). Both are excellent examples of\r\nthe several masters. Both were, no doubt, good likenesses; but there is\r\na suggestion of poetry in Moretto's which one misses in Moroni's. Both\r\nare believed to be portraits of members of the Fernaroli family.\r\n\r\n\r\n1023. AN ITALIAN LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Moroni_ (Bergamese: 1525-1578). _See 697._\r\n\r\nSaid to be the wife of the subject of the preceding portrait. Not so\r\nhappy a production; Moroni's strength lay in portraits of the other sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n1024. AN ITALIAN ECCLESIASTIC.\r\n\r\n  _Moroni_ (Bergamese: 1525-1578). _See 697._\r\n\r\nThe letter in his hand is addressed to himself, and tells us that he\r\nis Ludovico di Terzi, Canon of Bergamo, and an Apostolic Prothonotary.\r\nThese latter functionaries, of whom there are still twelve in the Roman\r\nChurch, are the chiefs of what may be called the Record Office of the\r\nChurch. It is their business to draw up the reports of all important\r\nChurch functions, such as the enthronements of new popes and public\r\nconsistories. It is an office of much dignity--as this holder of it\r\nseems to be fully conscious, and the prothonotaries rank with bishops\r\nin the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n1025. AN ITALIAN NOBLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Il Moretto_ (Brescian: 1498-1555). _See 299._\r\n\r\nThis picture, dated 1526, is one of Moretto's most elegant portraits.\r\nIt is a true character portrait, a picture of a soul as well as of\r\na face. It shows us an Italian nobleman with all the poetry and\r\naspiration of chivalry. On his scarlet cap he bears his proud device--a\r\nmedallion in gold and enamel of St. Christopher bearing the infant\r\nSaviour--the ideal of Christian chivalry: \"Inasmuch as ye have done it\r\nunto the least of one of these, ye have done it unto me.\" The picture\r\nis no doubt a portrait of one of the Fernaroli family, from whose\r\npalace in Brescia it came.\r\n\r\n\r\n1031. MARY MAGDALENE.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo_ (Brescian: about 1480-1548).\r\n\r\n      Savoldo, \"an excellent amateur, who was apparently first a\r\n      pupil of Romanino, then of Giovanni Bellini, and later of\r\n      Titian\"[200] (Morelli: _Borghese Gallery_, p. 246). \"He visited\r\n      Florence in 1508, and we find him enrolled as master in the\r\n      Painters' Guild there; his stay cannot, however, have been of\r\n      long duration, as none of his works known to us betray the\r\n      slightest Florentine influence\" (_id. German Galleries_, p.\r\n      408). \"His works,\" says Sir F. Burton, \"display a distinct\r\n      individuality, the result of tendencies inherent in his nature.\r\n      The romantic element, already developed in Venetian art, shows\r\n      itself strongly in his passion for scenes of early dawn and\r\n      late sunset and effects of night illuminated by fire. His human\r\n      types are pleasing with a certain grave dignity. His colouring\r\n      is on the whole colder than that of his contemporaries of the\r\n      Veneto-Brescian School, and his flesh tints are adust and\r\n      sombre, especially in his male figures; nor are his draperies\r\n      generally brilliant in colour, although he delighted in the\r\n      sheen of silken stuffs, contrasting it with the kind of\r\n      twilight which pervades many of his pictures.\" \"His landscapes\r\n      in sacred subjects make a profound impression of silent wonder\r\n      and devotion. They seem to palpitate in sympathy with the\r\n      deeds they witness, instead of being mere scenic backgrounds.\r\n      In the Berlin Deposition, for instance, the sky is lurid\r\n      and blood-stained; in the Adoration at Turin the shepherds\r\n      seem to be stealing noiselessly along, afraid of causing the\r\n      least disturbance in the hush and awe of the morning\" (Mary\r\n      Logan's _Guide to Hampton Court_, in which collection there\r\n      is a picture by Savoldo of a Madonna and Child, dated 1527).\r\n      Savoldo's pictures are rare, and often pass under other names.\r\n      He was, says Vasari (iv. 535), \"a fanciful and ingenious\r\n      person, what he has accomplished well meriting to be highly\r\n      commended.\" An important altar-piece, bearing his signature,\r\n      is in the Brera at Milan, and a beautiful \"Adoration of the\r\n      Shepherds\" is in the Church of St. Giobbe at Venice.\r\n\r\n\"A vein of realism, combined with the mystery of Savoldo's deep colours\r\nand half-lights, is seen in the picture of a woman shrouded in a mantle\r\nin the National Gallery\" (_Layard_, ii. 585). The picture agrees with\r\nthe description given by Ridolfi of a \"Magdalene,\" \"a celebrated\r\nwork of which there are many copies.\" A very similar picture, signed\r\nwith Savoldo's name, is in the Berlin Gallery. The Magdalen is here\r\napproaching the sepulchre, before which is a vase of ointment on a\r\nsquare stone--for she had \"bought sweet spices, that they might come\r\nand anoint him. And very early in the morning ... they came unto the\r\nsepulchre at the rising of the sun\" (Mark xvi. 1, 2). Notice the daring\r\nanachronism in the Venetian background, which \"gives with exquisite\r\ntruth a very early dawn upon the Giudecca.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1032. CHRIST'S AGONY IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  _Lo Spagna_ (Umbrian: painted 1503-1530).\r\n\r\n      Giovanni di Pietro, called Lo Spagna (the Spaniard), presumably\r\n      from his nationality, was a pupil of Pietro Perugino--the\r\n      best, perhaps, of all his pupils who remained untouched by\r\n      other influences. Observe for the influence of Perugino's\r\n      teaching the lovely flowers in the foreground and the attitude\r\n      of the leader of the Roman soldiers on the left (like that\r\n      of Perugino's Michael in 288). In 1516 Lo Spagna was made a\r\n      citizen of Spoleto, and in the following year president of the\r\n      Society of Artists there. The Madonna Enthroned, now in the\r\n      Lower Church of Assisi, is considered his masterpiece.\r\n\r\nAn angel bearing a chalice flies towards Christ from above (\"O my\r\nFather, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy\r\nwill be done\"). On the right is Judas with a band of Roman soldiers.\r\nOn the foreground are the three disciples sleeping (\"What! could ye\r\nnot watch with me one hour? Watch, and pray, that ye enter not into\r\ntemptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak\").\r\n\r\nThis picture was at one time ascribed to the young Raphael,[201] being\r\nidentified with the work which he executed for Duke Guidobaldo of\r\nUrbino, and which is thus described by Vasari (iii. 8): \"For the same\r\nnoble, the master executed another small picture, representing Christ\r\npraying in the Garden, with three of the apostles, who are sleeping\r\nat some distance, and which is so beautifully painted that it could\r\nscarcely be either better or otherwise were it even in miniature.\"\r\nVasari traces the history of the picture down to his time, when it\r\nwas in the Hermitage of Camaldoli. Our picture was formerly in the\r\npossession of Prince Gabrielli at Rome. The greater portion of the\r\noriginal drawing for it is in the Uffizi, catalogued under Perugino.\r\n\r\n\r\n1033. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Filippino Lippi_ (Florentine: 1457-1504). _See 293._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThis picture[202] (like 592, _q.v._) is often ascribed to Botticelli,\r\nfrom whom Filippino learnt his fondness for the circular form. Every\r\none will recognise too the resemblance to Botticelli in the daintiness\r\nof the dresses, the trappings of the horses (especially in the middle\r\nof the foreground), and the other accessories (such as the head-dresses\r\nof the Magi on the right). Vasari, indeed, says of Filippino that \"the\r\nornaments he added were so new, so fanciful, and so richly varied, that\r\nhe must be considered the first who taught the moderns the new method\r\nof giving variety to the habiliments, and who first embellished his\r\nfigures by adorning them with vestments after the antique.\" Filippino\r\nand later painters give these embellishments to angels as well as\r\nto men; and Vasari, it will be seen, considered it altogether an\r\nimprovement. Some remarks on the other side will be found in _Modern\r\nPainters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. v. § 14 (\"Of the Superhuman\r\nIdeal\"). \"The ornaments used by Angelico, Giotto, and Perugino (see,\r\n_e.g._ 288) are always of a _generic_ and _abstract_ character. They\r\nare not diamonds, nor brocades, nor velvets, nor gold embroideries;\r\nthey are mere spots of gold or of colour, simple patterns upon\r\n_textureless_ draperies; the angel wings burn with transparent crimson\r\nand purple and amber, but they are not set forth with peacocks' plumes;\r\nthe golden circlets gleam with changeful light, but they are not beaded\r\nwith pearls nor set with sapphires. In the works of Filippino Lippi,\r\nMantegna, and many other painters following, interesting examples may\r\nbe found of the opposite treatment; and as in Lippi the heads are\r\nusually very sweet, and the composition severe, the degrading effect of\r\nthe realised decorations and imitated dress may be seen in him simply,\r\nand without any addition of painfulness from other deficiencies of\r\nfeeling.\" In addition to the minor ornamentation, one may notice in\r\nthis picture the crowded groups of spectators which Filippino was fond\r\nof introducing. But so harmoniously are they grouped in six principal\r\ngroups that the spectator will at first probably be surprised to hear\r\nthat there are as many as seventy figures in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n1034. THE NATIVITY OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Sandro Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510).\r\n\r\n      The family surname of Sandro (Alessandro, or Alexander) was\r\n      Filipepi. \"He was apprenticed when a lad to a goldsmith, called\r\n      Botticello (for he obstinately refused to learn either to\r\n      read, write, or sum); of which master we know only that he so\r\n      formed this boy that thenceforward the boy thought it right to\r\n      be called Botticello's Sandro, and nobody else's (in Italian\r\n      Sandro di Botticello, abbreviated into Sandro Botticelli).[203]\r\n      Having learned prosperously how to manage gold, he took a\r\n      fancy to know how to manage colour, and was put under the\r\n      best master in Florence, the Monk Lippi\" (see 666). Some\r\n      characteristics of Lippi's art--its union of a buoyant spirit\r\n      of life and enjoyment with simplicity and tenderness of\r\n      religious feeling--are seen in the pupil. But he added in his\r\n      turn marked characteristics of his own, which are noticed in\r\n      detail under his several pictures here. \"Where Fra Filippo was\r\n      all repose, Sandro was all movement.\" Moreover, Botticelli's\r\n      range of subject was very wide--embracing Venus crowned with\r\n      roses and the Virgin crowned by Christ, the birth of Love (at\r\n      Florence), and the birth of the Saviour. Botticelli, says\r\n      Ruskin, is \"the only painter of Italy who understood the\r\n      thoughts of Heathens and Christians equally, and could in a\r\n      measure paint both Aphrodite and the Madonna. So that he is, on\r\n      the whole, the most universal of painters; and, take him all in\r\n      all, the greatest Florentine workman\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1872,\r\n      xxii. 2). He was, we are told, _persona sofistica_, and lived\r\n      on terms of intimacy with members of the Florentine Platonic\r\n      Academy. The speculations which he shared with the poet Matteo\r\n      Palmieri are enshrined in his \"Assumption\" (No. 1126), painted\r\n      about 1475. In 1481 he executed a series of designs for\r\n      Landino's edition of Dante: these wonderful drawings, formerly\r\n      in the Hamilton Collection, are now at Berlin. \"By this time,\"\r\n      says Ruskin, \"he was accounted so good a divine, as well as\r\n      painter, that Pope Sixtus IV. sent for him to be master of\r\n      the works in his new (Sistine) chapel--where the first thing\r\n      my young gentleman does, mind you, is to paint the devil,\r\n      in a monk's dress, tempting Christ! The sauciest thing, out\r\n      and out, done in the history of the Reformation, it seems to\r\n      me; yet so wisely done, and with such true respect otherwise\r\n      shown for what was sacred in the Church, that the Pope didn't\r\n      mind; and all went on as merrily as marriage bells.\" The\r\n      history of Moses--the subject of his other fresco in the\r\n      Sistine Chapel--\"teems with his exuberant power and displays\r\n      great grandeur of landscape.\" In the same chapel are also 28\r\n      portraits of Popes by Botticelli. \"And having thus obtained\r\n      great honour and reputation, and considerable sums of money,\r\n      he squandered all the last away. And at this time, Savonarola\r\n      beginning to make himself heard, and founding in Florence the\r\n      company of the Piagnoni (Mourners or Grumblers, as opposed to\r\n      the men of pleasure), Sandro made a Grumbler of himself, being\r\n      then some forty years old; fell sadder, wiser, and poorer day\r\n      by day; until he became a poor bedesman of Lorenzo de' Medici;\r\n      and having gone some time on crutches, being unable to stand\r\n      upright, died peacefully\" (_Ariadne Florentina_, Lecture VI.;\r\n      _Fors Clavigera_, 1872, xxii. 2-6).\r\n\r\n      Few things are more curious in the history of taste than the\r\n      vicissitudes of Botticelli's fame. In his own day he had been\r\n      much esteemed, but his reputation was soon eclipsed. In 1602\r\n      a decree was issued by the Grand Duke of Tuscany prohibiting\r\n      the inhabitants of Florence from removing important works\r\n      of art, for \"neither the city nor the land itself is to be\r\n      despoiled of the masterpieces of eminent painters.\" The\r\n      schedule of _eccellenti pittori_ contains nineteen names,\r\n      among which that of Filippino Lippi, Botticelli's pupil, is\r\n      included, but not Botticelli himself.[204] The rediscovery\r\n      of Botticelli has fallen to our country and generation. The\r\n      influence of Rossetti, the example of Burne-Jones, the famous\r\n      essay of Pater, and the enthusiasm of Ruskin, have established\r\n      a cult of Botticelli which in earlier generations would have\r\n      passed for a mild lunacy.[205] Goldsmith, had he witnessed\r\n      it, might have substituted the name of Botticelli for that of\r\n      Perugino in his satire on fashionable æstheticism. The poetical\r\n      imagination of Botticelli, his inventive design, the strong\r\n      sense of life which glows through all his pictures, are truly\r\n      admirable. But what lends additional force to his vogue is\r\n      the seal of _intimité_ which is set upon his work. Botticelli\r\n      treats his themes, says Burton \"with a verve, a naïveté, and\r\n      pathos peculiar to himself.\" Besides the very greatest men,\r\n      there is (says Pater) \"a certain number of artists who have\r\n      a distinct faculty of their own by which they convey to us a\r\n      peculiar quality of pleasure which we cannot get elsewhere, and\r\n      these, too, have their place in general culture. Of this select\r\n      number Botticelli is one; he has the freshness, the uncertain\r\n      and diffident promise which belongs to the earlier Renaissance\r\n      itself, and makes it perhaps the most interesting period in\r\n      the history of the mind; in studying his work one begins to\r\n      understand to how great a place in human culture the art of\r\n      Italy had been called.\"\r\n\r\nThe other pictures by Botticelli in the National Gallery (see 275,\r\n1126, and 915) adequately represent his earlier phases; this one\r\ncompletes the story of his life--painted as it was under Savonarola's\r\ninfluence--\r\n\r\n    Wrought in the troublous times of Italy\r\n      By Sandro Botticelli, when for fear\r\n\r\n      Of that last judgment, and last day drawn near\r\n    To end all labour and all revelry,\r\n    He worked and prayed in silence.\r\n\r\n  ANDREW LANG: _Ballads and Lyrics, etc._\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and curious picture is very characteristic of\r\nBotticelli's genius. It is full of highly wrought emotion--note \"the\r\nfervour of the still Madonna as she kneels before the Child, the\r\nextraordinary nervous tension which the artist has managed to suggest\r\nin the seated figure of Joseph, the rapture and ecstasy of the angels\";\r\nthe picture is full also, as we shall see, of mystic symbolism, but\r\nall is crowned and harmonised by a sense of pictorial daintiness and\r\nbeauty. The centre of the picture is occupied by the familiar subject\r\nof the Nativity, and the accessories suggest in symbolic fashion the\r\neffects of Christ's Advent upon the good and the evil respectively. The\r\ntheological symbolism may be seen in the gesture of the divine Child\r\npointing to his mouth--typifying that he was the Word of God. So at the\r\nbottom of the picture there are devils running, at Christ's coming,\r\ninto chinks of the rocks (those who are Christ's must put away \"the\r\nworks of darkness\"); whilst the shepherds and angels embracing signify\r\nthe reconciliation such as Savonarola wished to effect between heaven\r\nand earth. On either side of the central group angels are telling\r\nthe glad tidings \"of peace on earth, goodwill towards men.\" Note the\r\nsymmetry in this part of the picture; the three Magi on the left, the\r\nthree shepherds in adoration on the right; and in colour, the red frock\r\nof the angel on the right, the red wings on the left. Meanwhile in the\r\nsky above is a lovely choir of Botticelli's floating angels, dancing\r\nbetween earth and heaven, on a golden background suffused with light.\r\nThe picture is, says Ruskin, \"a quite perfect example of what the\r\nmasters of the pure Greek school did in Florence.... The entire purpose\r\nof the picture is a mystic symbolism by motion and chiaroscuro. By\r\nmotion, first. There is a dome of burning clouds in the upper heaven.\r\nTwelve angels half float, half dance, in a circle, round the lower\r\nvault of it. All their drapery is drifted so as to make you feel the\r\nwhirlwind of their motion. They are seen by gleams of silvery or fiery\r\nlight, relieved against an equally lighted blue of inimitable depth\r\nand loveliness. It is impossible for you ever to see a more noble\r\nwork of passionate Greek chiaroscuro--rejoicing in light\" (_Lectures\r\non Landscape_, § 58). The introduction in the same picture of the\r\nsolemn teaching below, with these beautiful angel forms above, suggests\r\nprecisely what Ruskin has defined to be Botticelli's position among\r\npictorial reformers. \"He was what Luther wished to be, but could not\r\nbe--a reformer still believing in the Church; his mind is at peace,\r\nand his art therefore can pursue the delight of beauty and yet remain\r\nprophetic.\" \"He was not a preacher of new doctrines, but a witness\r\nagainst the betrayal of old ones.\"\r\n\r\nThe first and more obvious intention of Botticelli's painted sermon\r\nwas, as we have seen, to show the effects of the Advent upon the good\r\nand the evil. But he has also a particular application, an esoteric\r\nmeaning. The clue to this is afforded by the Greek inscription at the\r\ntop, which, being interpreted, is--\r\n\r\n      \"This picture I, Alexander, painted at the end of the year\r\n      1500, in the troubles of Italy, in the half-time after the\r\n      time during the fulfilment of the eleventh of St. John, in the\r\n      Second Woe of the Apocalypse, in the loosing of the devil for\r\n      three years and a half. Afterwards he shall be confined, and we\r\n      shall see him trodden down, as in this picture.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the troubles of Italy, at the end of the year 1500.\" Now, on\r\nMay 12, 1497, exactly three years and a half before the date of\r\nBotticelli's inscription, Savonarola was burnt alive (as depicted\r\non the little panel, No. 1301); and his death, says the historian,\r\n\"meant for Florence the triumph of all that was most corrupt; vice\r\nwas everywhere rampant, and virtuous living was utterly despised.\"\r\nBut in the faith of Botticelli, the reverent disciple of Savonarola,\r\nthis tyranny of the Evil One was doomed to pass away. He saw \"in\r\nthe troubles of Italy\" a fulfilment of the awful words to which his\r\ninscription refers us in the eleventh chapter of the Revelation of St.\r\nJohn the Divine:--\r\n\r\n      The holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.\r\n      And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall\r\n      prophesy. These are the two olive trees. And when they shall\r\n      have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out\r\n      of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall\r\n      overcome them, and kill them. And they that dwell upon the\r\n      earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send\r\n      gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented\r\n      them that dwelt on the earth. And after three days and an half\r\n      the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood\r\n      upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.\r\n      And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them,\r\n      Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and\r\n      their enemies beheld them. The second woe is past. And there\r\n      were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world\r\n      are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he\r\n      shall reign for ever and ever.\r\n\r\nTo the elect, then, Botticelli meant his picture to show the fulfilment\r\nof the prophecy by the Second Advent of Christ, and the final triumph\r\nof Savonarola. The men embraced by angels are in this reading of the\r\npicture the \"witnesses\" to whom the spirit of life was returned; they\r\nare welcomed back to earth by angels, ere they are rapt heavenward.\r\nThey bear olive boughs, because in the Apocalypse olive trees are\r\nsymbolical of the Lord's anointed ones. \"There is but one point\r\nwhich seems at variance with the Biblical text: in it two witnesses\r\nare spoken of, here there are three. This deviation was doubtless\r\nintentional. When Savonarola died, two others shared his palm of\r\nmartyrdom, Fra Domenico Buonvicini and Fra Silvestre Marussi. The three\r\nfigures crowned with myrtle represent the three risen and glorified\r\nmartyrs\" (Richter's _Lectures on the National Gallery_, p. 61. See also\r\nMr. Sidney Colvin's article in the _Portfolio_, Feb. 1879).\r\n\r\n\r\n1035. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Francia Bigio_ (Florentine: 1482-1525).\r\n\r\n      Francesco di Cristoforo Bigi (this picture is signed FRA CP\r\n      = _Franciscus Cristophori pinxit_), commonly called Francia\r\n      Bigio, was the son of a weaver at Milan, and \"devoted himself\r\n      to the art of painting, not so much (Vasari tells us) because\r\n      he was desirous of fame, as that he might thus be enabled to\r\n      render assistance to his indigent relations.\" He was at first\r\n      the pupil of Albertinelli (645), and afterwards formed a close\r\n      friendship with Andrea del Sarto, in conjunction with whom\r\n      he produced his first important work in 1513, in the small\r\n      cloister of the Servi. It was here that occurred the famous\r\n      scene, described by Vasari, with the Friars, who, having\r\n      uncovered Bigio's fresco of the _Sposalizio_ before the painter\r\n      considered it finished, so enraged him that he defaced some of\r\n      the finest heads in it with a mason's hammer, and would have\r\n      destroyed the whole but for forcible intervention. Neither he\r\n      nor any other painter could be induced to repair the injuries,\r\n      which remain to this day. Bigio was, as we may see from this\r\n      picture, an admirable portrait-painter--an excellence which\r\n      he owed, says Vasari, to his patient and modest industry. He\r\n      was \"a great lover of peace, and for that reason (adds Vasari\r\n      drily) would never marry.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man wears on his breast the cross of the Knights of Malta.\r\nThe letter in his hand bears the date 1514. On the parapet is an\r\ninscription: tar: vblia: chi: bien: eima (slowly forgets he who loves\r\nwell)--\r\n\r\n        Dear as remember'd kisses after death,\r\n    And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd\r\n    On lips that are for others; deep as love,\r\n    Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;\r\n    O Death in Life, the days that are no more.\r\n\r\n  TENNYSON: _The Princess_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1036. A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish: 15th-16th century).\r\n\r\nA picture, it might be, of Hamlet with the skulls: \"That skull had a\r\ntongue in it, and could sing once.\" In his left hand he holds a flower:\r\n\"there's pansies, that's for thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1041. THE VISION OF ST. HELENA.\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Veronese_ (Veronese: 1528-1588). _See 26._\r\n\r\n      St. Helena, the mother of Constantine, made a pilgrimage to\r\n      Jerusalem, when a victory was gained by the emperor, to recover\r\n      the very cross of which she had seen a mysterious symbol.\r\n      Having reached the sacred city, she caused the soil of Calvary\r\n      to be excavated, because the Jews were accustomed to bury the\r\n      instruments of execution upon the spot where they had been\r\n      used. And there she found three crosses, and that one which was\r\n      the holy cross was distinguished from the others by the healing\r\n      of a lady of quality who was sick. The empress divided the\r\n      true cross into three parts, giving one of them to the Bishop\r\n      of Jerusalem, and another to the church at Constantinople. The\r\n      third she brought to Rome, where she built for it the great\r\n      basilica of S. Croce.\r\n\r\nHere we see the saint in devout reverie, while through the open window\r\ntwo cherubim bear a cross through the air. This beautiful picture, in\r\nwhich Veronese gives us an ideal and mystic composition, treated with a\r\nsimplicity unusual to him, seems to have been derived from a plate by\r\nMarc Antonio, the founder of Italian engraving (1480-1534), supposed\r\nto be after a drawing by Raphael. The design is identical, though an\r\nexquisitely airy angel with a slender cross in Marc Antonio's engraving\r\nis replaced in Veronese's picture by chubby cherubs with a more solid\r\ncross. (The engraving is reproduced in the _Art Journal_, 1891, p.\r\n376, with some critical remarks. \"This wonderful picture,\" says the\r\nwriter, \"is at once a delight and a puzzle. If Veronese was capable of\r\nefforts like the 'Vision of St. Helena,' why have we not more such,\r\nseeing how many treasures of his art have survived to us? The engraving\r\noffers an explanation, curiously exact, of this difficulty. Whatever\r\nin the 'Vision' is Veronese's own--the drapery and the colour--is not\r\nmore remarkable than in many other pictures of his; on the other hand,\r\nwhatever is not distinctively of Veronese is Marc Antonio's.... What\r\nmore natural than that Veronese should essay to clothe in the glory of\r\nhis own colouring[206] some creation of the great Italian who learnt\r\nfrom Dürer how to interpret the art of Raphael to Italy?\") Veronese's\r\npicture once formed the altar-piece of a chapel dedicated to St. Helena\r\nat Venice, and was afterwards in the collection of the great Duke of\r\nMarlborough.\r\n\r\n\r\n1042. A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Catharina van Hemessen_ (Flemish: painted about 1550).\r\n\r\n      Catharina was the daughter of a painter named Jan Sanders,\r\n      called Jan van Hemessen from his native village. She married\r\n      a musician of repute in the Low Countries, and with him went\r\n      to Madrid, where she acquired celebrity and favour through her\r\n      ability in portraiture.\r\n\r\n\r\n1045. A CANON AND HIS PATRON SAINT.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard David_ (Early Flemish: 1460-1523).\r\n\r\n      This remarkable painter, who has been rediscovered in recent\r\n      years by the researches of Mr. Weale, was born in Oudewater,\r\n      a small town in the south of Holland. He settled in Bruges in\r\n      1483, passing through the various grades of the Painters' Guild\r\n      in that town, until he became its Dean in 1501. He was also\r\n      connected with the Guild of Illuminators of Bruges, and with\r\n      that of painters at Antwerp. In 1496 he married the daughter\r\n      of a Bruges goldsmith. In 1509 he painted and presented to\r\n      the Carmelites of Sion at Bruges a beautiful altar-piece, in\r\n      which he introduced his own portrait in the background to the\r\n      right, and that of his wife to the left. This altar-piece was\r\n      sold by the Carmelites in 1785, and is now in the Museum of\r\n      Rouen. Other important works by the painter are now in the\r\n      Academy at Bruges, and in the church of St. Basil in that\r\n      town there is a triptych by him. The present picture and No.\r\n      1432 were also painted for a church in the same place. David's\r\n      works have often been confounded with those of Memlinc, and\r\n      it is impossible to give them higher praise. He was a fine\r\n      colourist. His faces show that he was an adequate interpreter\r\n      of character. The details he executed with the utmost\r\n      minuteness and skill; and he is remarkable also for his careful\r\n      and truthful landscapes. In 1508 David entered a religious\r\n      brotherhood; he was buried in Notre Dame at Bruges, where he\r\n      was laid beneath the tower.\r\n\r\nThe canon kneels in adoration, with his patron saints around him--St.\r\nBernardino of Siena behind, St. Donatian in advance of him, and St.\r\nMartin to the left. It was St. Martin who shared his cloak with the\r\nbeggar, and here in the distance to the left--in compliment to the\r\ncanon's generosity--is a beggar limping towards the group, asking\r\nalms. Notice the wood through which he walks. The subdued light\r\nbeneath the thick foliage of the trees is admirably rendered. David\r\n\"was the first painter to think of the shadow-giving nature of trees.\r\nTrees had for many years formed a favourite subject for backgrounds,\r\nbut even by Memlinc they were rather conventionally rendered, one by\r\none, not grouped into woods, and seldom brought into the foreground.\r\nHere we have a wood brought near us, with its domed canopy of foliage\r\nabove, and its labyrinth of trunks buried in sylvan twilight below\"\r\n(Conway's _Early Flemish Artists_, p. 298). Notice also the beautiful\r\nand elaborate work on the robes of St. Martin and St. Donatian. They\r\nare fully described in Mr. Weale's monograph referred to below. This\r\nwill repay the most minute examination. The crimson-velvet cope of St.\r\nMartin is a masterpiece. The portrait of the donor is admirable.\r\n\r\nThe history of this beautiful picture, and of the changes and chances\r\nit went through before finding a permanent home in the National\r\nGallery, is very curious. In 1501 a colleague of Richard van der\r\nCapelle (see 1432) and one of the executors of his will, namely, Canon\r\nBernardin Salviati (illegitimate son of a rich Florentine merchant who\r\ntraded or resided in Flanders), was secretary of the chapter of S.\r\nDonatian at Bruges. Having obtained leave to restore and embellish the\r\naltar of SS. John Baptist and Mary Magdalene, he commissioned Gerard\r\nDavid to paint the shutters of the reredos. These shutters, together\r\nwith those of several other altar reredoses in the nave of the church,\r\nwere, at the request of the sacristan, who complained that they were\r\nalways breaking the wax candles, sold in a lot by order of the chapter\r\nin 1787 for an insignificant sum of money. What became of the others is\r\nnot known, but the one before us was, as we learn from the letters of\r\nHorace Walpole, bought in 1792, by Mr. Thomas Barrett, of Lee Priory,\r\nKent, and it figures in the catalogue of that collection as \"a group\r\nof saints by John Gossart of Maubeuge.\" At the sale of the Lee Priory\r\nCollection in May 1859, it was knocked down to the late Mr. William\r\nBenoni White for 525 guineas. Sir J. C. Robinson drew Mr. Weale's\r\nattention to the picture, which he at once recognised as being the\r\nright-hand shutter of the reredos of Salviati's chantry altar. \"I tried\r\nhard,\" says Mr. Weale, \"but in vain, to persuade the late Sir Charles\r\nEastlake to purchase it for the National Gallery, but Mr. White would\r\nnot part with it for less than £1000. Oddly enough the latter, who bore\r\nthe character of being a most penurious and miserly man, by his last\r\nwill and testament proved a generous benefactor to the nation, and left\r\nthis panel in July 1878 to the National Gallery\" (W. H. James Weale:\r\n_Portfolio_ monograph on Gerard David, 1895, p. 18).\r\n\r\n\r\n1047. A FAMILY GROUP.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo Lotto_ (Venetian: 1480-1555). _See 699._\r\n\r\n\"Supposed,\" says the official catalogue, \"to represent the painter,\r\nhis wife, and two children.\" This cannot be the case, for Lotto seems\r\nto have had no close domestic ties. The picture is, however, full of\r\ninterest for its own sake. \"The man and the woman are, it is true,\r\nboth looking out of the picture, but nevertheless the feeling we have\r\nis that the group before us is not, as is usual in Italian family\r\npictures, a mere collection of portraits, but that it is composed of\r\npeople who are intimately related to each other, constantly acting\r\nand reacting one upon the other, and that it is presented in a way\r\nwhich, while giving the individuality of each, makes it hard to\r\nthink of them except as conditioned, and even determined, by each\r\nother's presence.\" We may in fact find in this domestic group an\r\nanticipation of the spirit of the modern psychological novel. \"Far\r\nfrom being painted as such groups usually were in Italy--a mere\r\ncollection of faces looking one like the other, but with no bond of\r\nsympathy or interest uniting them--it is in itself a family story, as\r\nmodern almost as Tolstoi's _Katia_. Lotto makes it evident that the\r\nsensitiveness of the man's nature has brought him to understand and\r\ncondone his wife's limitations, and that she, in her turn, has been\r\nrefined and softened into sympathy with him; so that the impression\r\nthe picture leaves is one of great kindliness, covering a multitude of\r\nsmall disappointments and incompatibilities\" (B. Berenson: _Lorenzo\r\nLotto_, pp. 194, 227, 322). Mr. Berenson calls attention further to\r\nthe historical significance of this page from contemporary life and\r\nmanners. The artist \"opens our eyes to the existence in a time and in\r\na country supposed to be wholly devoted to carnality and carnage, of\r\ngentle, sensitive people, who must have had many of our own social\r\nand ethical ideas.\" He \"helps us to a truer and saner view of the\r\nsixteenth century in Italy than has been given by popular writers from\r\nStendhal downwards, who too exclusively have devoted themselves to its\r\nlurid side. Lotto's charity helps us to restore that human balance\r\nwithout which the Italy of the sixteenth century would be a veritable\r\npandemonium.\" The Venetian costumes, etc. may also be noticed. The\r\nlittle girl is dressed in as \"grown-up\" a way as her mother. On the\r\ntable is a Turkey carpet, reminding us of Venetian commerce with the\r\nEast. A Turkey carpet figures also in No. 1105.\r\n\r\n\r\n1048. PORTRAIT OF A CARDINAL.\r\n\r\n  _Italian School_ (16th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nPainted on copper, a material which seems first to have been used for\r\npainting in the School of Antwerp. M. Auguste Cartan, of Besançon, in\r\na paper by him in the _Courrier de l'Art_ (June 25, 1886), points out\r\nthe resemblance between this portrait and one, also on copper, in the\r\nmuseum at Besançon, ascribed to Scipione Pulzone, surnamed Gaetano\r\n(1550-1558), a painter who has been called \"the Van Dyck of the Roman\r\nSchool.\" A contemporary biographer speaks of Gaetano's portraits as\r\nbeing so conscientious that every hair is painted, and of his skill in\r\nrendering various stuffs; both these characteristics may be observed\r\nin the present picture. In the same paper M. Cartan identifies the\r\nCardinal as Cardinal Sirleto, Librarian of the Vatican 1570-1585, and\r\ntutor of S. Carlo Borromeo. There is a bust of Cardinal Sirleto in the\r\nchurch of San Lorenzo at Rome, and M. Cartan declares the resemblance\r\nbetween the bust and this portrait to be unmistakable. There is also\r\nin the Corsini Palace at Rome a bust portrait of the same personage by\r\nScipione Gaetano.\r\n\r\n\r\n1049. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (German-Westphalian: 15th century).\r\n\r\nA good example of the strength and weakness of this German art. What is\r\ngood are the clothes, which are very quaint and various. The figures\r\nshow a ghastly enjoyment of horror and ugliness: notice especially the\r\ncrucified thief on the left.\r\n\r\n\r\n1050. A SEA VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _Bakhuizen_ (Dutch: 1631-1708). _See 204._\r\n\r\n\r\n1051. OUR LORD, ST. THOMAS, AND ST. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n  _Bertucci_ (Umbrian: 16th century). _See 282._\r\n\r\nOur Lord extends his hand and foot to the doubting St. Thomas: \"Reach\r\nhither thy finger, and behold my hands; ... and be not faithless,\r\nbut believing.\" To the right, resting his hands on the shoulder of\r\nthe donor of the picture, is St. Anthony of Padua, another saint who\r\ndoubted \"till\"--as the legend (painted by Murillo) describes--\"in his\r\narms,\" so it is told, \"The saint did his dear Lord enfold, And there\r\nappeared a light like gold From out the skies of Padua.\" This picture\r\nappears to be by the same painter as No. 282, and both are now ascribed\r\nto Bertucci.\r\n\r\n\r\n1052. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Lombard School_ (15th or early 16th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n1053. A CHURCH AT DELFT.\r\n\r\n  _Emanuel de Witte_ (Dutch: 1607-1692). _Room X._\r\n\r\n      Witte was a native of Alkmaar, but settled at Delft, where he\r\n      probably met another architectural painter, Dirk van Delen.\r\n      \"An exact knowledge of perspective, a perfect conception of\r\n      light and shade, and a delicacy of execution which reveals\r\n      every detail without degenerating into dryness, figures well\r\n      drawn and sufficiently picturesque ... are the qualities which\r\n      distinguish his works\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_, p. 245).\r\n      The picture before us is not a very favourable specimen of\r\n      the painter's skill. In the gallery at Hertford House one of\r\n      his masterpieces may be seen. His style, says Mr. Phillips in\r\n      his catalogue of that collection, \"is absolutely opposed to\r\n      that of the somewhat earlier painters of the Flemish School,\r\n      Steenwyck the Younger and Pieter Neeffs the Elder, who obtained\r\n      their chief effects by accuracy of linear perspective, while\r\n      De Witte realised his by broad and masterly chiaroscuro. In\r\n      his treatment of light and colour he shows some affinity to\r\n      Pieter de Hooch.\" The date of his birth is uncertain; it should\r\n      perhaps be 1617.\r\n\r\nNotice the anti-Pauline practice of the worshippers (\"Every man\r\npraying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. But every\r\nwoman that prayeth with her head uncovered, dishonoureth her head\"--1\r\nCorinthians xi. 4, 5). Here it is the women who are \"uncovered,\" the\r\nmen who are \"covered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1054. A VIEW IN VENICE.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Guardi_ (Venetian: 1712-1793). _See 210._\r\n\r\n\r\n1055. A VILLAGE CARD PARTY.\r\n\r\n  _Hendrick Sorgh_ (Dutch: 1611-1670).\r\n\r\n      Hendrick Rokes, a painter of Rotterdam, was the son of Martin\r\n      Rokes, the master of the passage-boat from Rotterdam to\r\n      Dordrecht. On account of his care and attention to passengers,\r\n      Martin acquired the appellation of Sorgh, or Careful; the name\r\n      descended to and was adopted by the son. Having shown an early\r\n      talent for art, Hendrick was sent to Antwerp, where he was\r\n      placed under the tuition of the younger Teniers. His style,\r\n      however, rather recalls that of Adrian Brouwer. He painted\r\n      Biblical subjects in a familiar manner, indoor scenes of humble\r\n      life, village fairs, and, later, river and sea views. Some of\r\n      his best works are in the Dresden Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe game rests with the woman, who is not going to play, it would seem,\r\ntill the score is settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n1056. \"A KISS IN THE CUP.\"\r\n\r\n  _Hendrick Sorgh_ (Dutch: 1611-1670).\r\n\r\n    Drink to me only with thine eyes,\r\n      And I will pledge with mine;\r\n    Or leave a kiss but in the cup\r\n      And I'll not look for wine.\r\n\r\n  BEN JONSON: _To Celia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1057. A RIVER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Claude Joseph Vernet_ (French: 1714-1789). _See 236._\r\n\r\n\r\n1058. VENICE: THE CANAL REGGIO.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See 127._\r\n\r\nOne of the principal waterways, after the Grand Canal, in Venice. The\r\npicture is a good instance of this painter's method of representing\r\nwater. He \"covers the whole space of it with one monotonous ripple,\r\ncomposed of a coat of well-chosen, but perfectly opaque and smooth\r\nsea-green, covered with a certain number--I cannot state the exact\r\naverage, but it varies from three hundred and fifty to four hundred\r\nand upwards, according to the extent of canvas to be covered, of white\r\nconcave touches, which are very properly symbolical of ripple[207]....\r\nIf it be but remembered that every one of the surfaces of those\r\nmultitudinous ripples is in nature a mirror which catches, according\r\nto its position, either the image of the sky, or of the silver beaks\r\nof the gondolas, or of their black bodies and scarlet draperies, or of\r\nthe white marble, or the green sea-weed on the low stones, it cannot\r\nbut be felt that those waves would have something more of colour upon\r\nthem than that opaque dead green.... Venice is sad and silent now to\r\nwhat she was in his time; but even yet, could I but place the reader\r\nat early morning on the quay below the Rialto, when the market-boats,\r\nfull-laden, float into groups of golden colour, and let him watch the\r\ndashing of the water about their glittering steely heads, and under\r\nthe shadows of the vine leaves; and show him the purple of the grapes\r\nand the figs, and the glowing of the scarlet gourds, carried away in\r\nlong streams upon the waves; and among them, the crimson fish-baskets,\r\nplashing and sparkling and flaming as the morning sun falls on their\r\nwet tawny sides; and above, the painted sails of the fishing-boats,\r\norange and white, scarlet and blue,--he would not be merciful to\r\nCanaletto any more\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. v. ch. i.\r\n§§ 18, 19).\r\n\r\n\r\n1059. VENICE: SAN PIETRO IN CASTELLO.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See 127._\r\n\r\nA humble church, typical of the humble origin of Venice, a city founded\r\non the sands by fugitives. The church stands on one of the outermost\r\nislets, where, in the seventh century, it is said that St. Peter\r\nappeared in person to the Bishop of Heraclea, and commanded him to\r\nfound, in his honour, a church in that spot. \"The title of Bishop of\r\nCastello was first taken in 1091; St. Mark's was not made the cathedral\r\nchurch till 1807.... The present church is among the least interesting\r\nin Venice; a wooden bridge, something like that of Battersea on a\r\nsmall scale, connects its island, now almost deserted, with a wretched\r\nsuburb of the city behind the arsenal; and a blank level of lifeless\r\ngrass, rotted away in places rather than trodden, is extended before\r\nits mildewed façade and solitary tower\" (_Stones of Venice_, vol. i.\r\nAppendix iv.)\r\n\r\n\r\n1060. TWO VEDETTES ON THE WATCH.\r\n\r\n  _Wouwerman_ (Dutch: 1619-1668). _See 878._\r\n\r\n\r\n1061. DELFT: SCENE OF AN EXPLOSION\r\n\r\n  _Egbert van der Poel_ (Dutch: 1621-1664).\r\n\r\n      Born at Delft; in 1650 entered as a member of the painter's\r\n      guild there; afterwards moved to Rotterdam, where he died.\r\n      \"Although his name recalls fires especially--never did painter\r\n      burn so many houses and farm cottages as Van der Poel--he\r\n      painted also small scenes in the style of Ostade, as we see\r\n      in his 'Rustic House' in the Louvre, and the 'Interior' in\r\n      the Museum of Amsterdam. There are also a few pictures by him\r\n      representing still life\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_, p. 156).\r\n\r\nOne of the many views painted by this artist of the explosion of a\r\npowder mill at Delft, October 12, 1654. One might think the mill\r\nexploded specially to be painted, so neatly and in order is everything\r\nrepresented. In this explosion, a well-known painter, Carel Fabrizius,\r\nlost his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n1062. A BATTLE PIECE\r\n\r\n  _Ferrarese School_ (early 16th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n1063. A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Flemish School_ (15th-16th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n1074. AN OYSTER SUPPER.\r\n\r\n  _Dirk Hals_ (Dutch; 1589-1656).\r\n\r\n      \"Dirk was the younger brother of Frans Hals (see 1021), and\r\n      was born at Malines in 1589. He followed his elder brother\r\n      to Haarlem, where he died in 1656--that is, ten years before\r\n      Frans. Dirk was a clever artist, at least so far as may be\r\n      judged by his works, which are extremely rare. His figures\r\n      are amusing, graceful in manner, and especially interesting\r\n      from their costumes, which belong to his own time, and now\r\n      appear somewhat strange and extravagant\" (Havard: _The Dutch\r\n      School_, p. 121). Dirk confined himself chiefly, says Burton,\r\n      \"to the representation of convivial parties, where cavaliers\r\n      and ladies are seen enjoying themselves without much reserve\r\n      at table, in the dance, or with music. His light pencil, his\r\n      brilliant colour, laid on thinly over a greyish ground, and\r\n      sharply accentuated, suited the themes and the small scale of\r\n      his pictures.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture is signed (on the architrave above the open door), and\r\ndated 1626.\r\n\r\n\r\n1075. VIRGIN AND CHILD, ST. JEROME, AND ST. FRANCIS.\r\n\r\n  _Perugino_ (Umbrian: 1446-1523). _See 288._\r\n\r\nA very \"Peruginesque\" example--full, that is, of the peculiar sentiment\r\nand apparent affectation which caused Goldsmith to make the admiration\r\nof him the test of absurd connoisseurship.[208] But \"what is commonly\r\nthought affected in his design,\" says Ruskin, \"is indeed the true\r\nremains of the great architectural symmetry which was soon to be lost,\r\nand which makes him the true follower of Arnolfo and Brunelleschi,\"\r\nthe great Florentine builders (_Ariadne Florentina_, § 72). The picture\r\ndisplays also in perfection \"that quality of tone in which Perugino\r\nstands unsurpassed; and the rich and liquid, but subdued colour is\r\nsteeped in a transparent atmosphere of pale golden glow\" (Burton).\r\n\r\nThe history of this picture affords a good instance of that enrichment\r\nof the National Gallery with \"graceful interludes by Perugino,\" saved\r\nfrom \"the wreck of Italian monasteries,\" of which Mr. Ruskin speaks\r\nin his preface to this work. It was painted by Perugino in 1507, to\r\nbe placed over an altar in memory of a master-carpenter at Perugia.\r\nIt afterwards passed into the possession of the monks who owned the\r\nchurch. They sold it, with the chapel in which it was placed, to the\r\nCecconi family, from whom it passed by inheritance to the family Della\r\nPenna. In 1822 the head of this family removed it to his palace,\r\nleaving a copy of it in its place in the church, and in 1879 the\r\npicture itself was bought from the Baron della Penna for the Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n1077. ALTAR-PIECE (dated 1501).\r\n\r\n  _Borgognone_ (Lombard: about 1455-1523). _See 298._\r\n\r\nA picture of the \"man of sorrows.\" On either side of the infant Christ\r\nare shown the scenes of his suffering[209]--\r\n\r\n    In stature grows the Heavenly Child,\r\n        With death before his eyes;\r\n    A Lamb unblemished, meek and mild,\r\n        Prepared for sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFor sacrifice--but also for redemption, and so above the throne are\r\nthe angels of God, playing the glad music of death swallowed up in\r\nvictory. In the right-hand compartment is Christ bearing his cross; in\r\nthe left his agony in the garden. The three disciples are here crouched\r\nasleep lower down, and behind a wall are the Roman soldiers, whilst\r\nfrom above an angel brings a cup with a cross, two spears, and a crown\r\nof thorns in it: \"Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:\r\nnevertheless, not my will, but thine be done. And there appeared an\r\nangel unto him from heaven, strengthening him\" (Luke xxii. 42, 43).\r\n\r\n\r\n1078. THE DEPOSITION FROM THE CROSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1079. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\n      These two pictures closely resemble in style and colouring\r\n      the large altar-piece in the church of St. Bavon at Ghent,\r\n      which is attributed to Gerard van der Meire.[210] That painter\r\n      flourished at Ghent about the middle of the fifteenth century;\r\n      entering the Guild of St. Luke in 1452, and becoming sub-dean\r\n      in 1474. He is described in a chronicle of the time as a pupil\r\n      of Hubert van Eyck, but the historian Van Mander says he began\r\n      to paint after the death of Jan van Eyck, a statement which is\r\n      confirmed by the date of his enrolment in the Guild. Nothing\r\n      is yet really known about him except the bare fact of his\r\n      existence, for no picture has been certainly identified as his.\r\n\r\n(1079.) It is interesting to compare this representation of the scene,\r\nalmost childlike in its simplicity, alike with the treatment by later\r\npainters (see, for instance, Rembrandt's, No. 47), and with the more\r\ndecorative and symbolic treatment of the early Italians (_e.g._\r\nBotticelli, No. 1034). The picture before us \"shows no particular\r\nfelicity of rendering, no depth or insight; it carries little\r\nconviction of reality, but it has a homely charm. The painter was\r\nthoroughly convinced of the actual truth of what he represented, and\r\nthought only of bringing the same home to everyday experience. In the\r\nbackground he has placed a village, in which men are discussing what is\r\ngoing on\" (J. E. Hodgson, R.A., in the _Magazine of Art_, 1890, p. 42).\r\n\r\n\r\n1080. HEAD OF JOHN THE BAPTIST.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (School of the Lower Rhine: 15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThe introduction of children's faces--in the character of mourning\r\nangels--to so ghastly a subject is very characteristic of the love of\r\nhorror common to the Flemish and German Schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n1081. A MAN AT PRAYER.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n\r\nProbably a portrait of the donor of an altar-piece, of which this\r\npicture formed one compartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n1082. THE VISIT OF THE MADONNA TO ST. ELIZABETH.\r\n\r\n  _Joachim Patinir_ (Early Flemish: died 1524). _See 715._\r\n\r\n\r\n1083. CHRIST CROWNED WITH THORNS.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\n\r\n1084. THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT.\r\n\r\n  _Joachim Patinir_ (Early Flemish: died 1524). _See 715._\r\n\r\n\r\n1085. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (School of the Lower Rhine: 15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nA picture of the same school as 706, but the Flemish influence is here\r\nmore discernible. In the background is a church lighted from within.\r\nThe heads are very ugly (notice the saint in the left compartment), but\r\nthe execution, especially of the accessories, is very delicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n1086. CHRIST APPEARING AFTER HIS RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nNotice the empty tomb, visible through the half-opened door in the\r\nbackground--with the Roman soldier asleep beside, and an angel above\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n1087. THE MOCKING OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early German: 15th century).\r\n\r\nSir Martin Conway says of the Lyversberg Passion what is equally\r\napplicable to this picture, and indeed to most of the German art of\r\nthe same period (_cf. e.g._ 1049). \"The Passion, as conceived by this\r\npainter, was a scene for the display of brutality rather than the\r\nexhibition of heroism. The enduring Christ is not the subject of the\r\npictures, but the torturing villains that surround him. The figure\r\nof Christ does not dominate the rest; the vile element seems always\r\nvictorious\" (_Early Flemish Artists_, p. 202).\r\n\r\n\r\n1088. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (German School: 16th century).\r\n\r\nAn altar-piece in three compartments. On the side panels are two\r\nfigures, probably the donor and his wife, kneeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n1089. MADONNA AND CHILD WITH ST. ELIZABETH.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n1090. PAN AND SYRINX.\r\n\r\n  _François Boucher_ (French: 1704-1770).\r\n\r\n      Boucher, \"the Anacreon of Painting,\" was the typical\r\n      painter-decorator of the Louis-quinze period. He painted (as\r\n      Mr. Dobson sings in _Old World Idylls_)--\r\n\r\n      Rose-water Raphael,--_en couleur de rose_,\r\n    The crowned Caprice, whose sceptre, nowise sainted,\r\n      Swayed the light realm of ballets and bon-mots;\r\n    Ruled the dim boudoir's _demi-jour_, or drove\r\n    Pink-ribboned flocks through some pink-flowered grove.\r\n\r\n    Made of his work a kind of languid Maying,\r\n      Filled with false gods and muses misbegot;--\r\n    A Versailles Eden of cosmetic youth,\r\n    Wherein most things went naked, save the Truth.\r\n\r\n      Boucher is represented by no less than 21 canvases at Hertford\r\n      House, some of them of considerable historical interest. For\r\n      Boucher owed much to the favour of Madame de Pompadour, who\r\n      purchased in 1753 the two fine pictures of \"Sunrise\" and\r\n      \"Sunset\" now at Hertford House. In the same collection are\r\n      the idyllic and erotic subjects with which Boucher decorated\r\n      the boudoir at the Hôtel de l'Arsenal in which the Pompadour\r\n      was wont to receive her royal lover. He also painted several\r\n      portraits of the all-powerful favourite, whom he instructed in\r\n      the art of etching; one of these portraits is also at Hertford\r\n      House. Boucher was the son of a designer for embroideries. He\r\n      spent some years in Rome, but returned to Paris untouched by\r\n      the great works he had seen. He suited his art to the taste of\r\n      the time, and had his reward in reaping considerable wealth by\r\n      his productions, which, including drawings for the engravers,\r\n      he poured forth in thousands. In 1755 he became inspector\r\n      of the Gobelins, an appointment which he resigned in 1765\r\n      on becoming first painter to the king. Sir Joshua Reynolds\r\n      describes a visit to Boucher, whom he found \"at work on a very\r\n      large picture without drawings or models of any kind.\" Sir\r\n      Joshua allows, however, to some of his earlier works, \"grace\r\n      and beauty and good skill in composition.\" His easy execution\r\n      and often dainty colour are also admired. He was the idol of\r\n      his day, but his meretricious art was the subject of very\r\n      pungent criticism from the not very austere Diderot.[211]\r\n\r\nFor another version of the same subject, see 659.\r\n\r\n\r\n1002. ST. SEBASTIAN.\r\n\r\n  _Zaganelli_ (Ferrarese: about 1500).\r\n\r\n      The only known work by a master who signs himself Bernardino\r\n      (of) Cotignola (in the Duchy of Ferrara). He was a brother of\r\n      Francesco Zaganelli, and is believed to have worked towards the\r\n      end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis picture formed the chief panel of an altar-piece formerly in the\r\nchurch of the Carmine at Pavia, and thus described by Bartoli:\r\n\r\n      In the twelfth chapel (is) an ancient picture divided into\r\n      six compartments, of which the three larger exhibit, in the\r\n      centre St. Sebastian, and at the sides St. Nicholas and St.\r\n      Catherine of Alexandria, while the three smaller which are\r\n      above represent the body of the Redeemer supported by two\r\n      angels in the centre, and at the sides the Virgin Mary and the\r\n      Announcing Angel. This (altar-piece) is the work of Bernardino\r\n      da Cotignola, who has affixed to it his name on a feigned label.\r\n\r\nFor the story of St. Sebastian, see under 669.\r\n\r\n\r\n1093. OUR LADY OF THE ROCKS.\r\n\r\n  _Leonardo da Vinci_ (Florentine: 1452-1519).\r\n\r\n      There is no more fascinating and illustrious name in the annals\r\n      of art than Leonardo, of Vinci, a town in the Val d'Arno below\r\n      Florence. He has been well called, from the many-sidedness of\r\n      his efforts, the Faust of the Renaissance. The great public\r\n      which knows him best by his few pictures and many drawings does\r\n      not always remember that he was also musician, critic, poet,\r\n      sculptor, architect, mechanist, mathematician, philosopher,\r\n      and explorer. In a letter addressed to Ludovico il Moro,\r\n      Prince of Milan, in whose service he lived for sixteen years\r\n      (1483-1499), he enumerates as his chief qualification his\r\n      skill in military engineering, and throws in his art as an\r\n      incidental accomplishment. \"I will also undertake any work in\r\n      sculpture, in marble, in bronze, or in terra-cotta; likewise\r\n      in painting I can do what may be done as well as any man, be\r\n      he who he may.\" The range and amount alike of his theoretical\r\n      discoveries and practical ingenuities were extraordinary. He\r\n      divined the circulation of the blood. He anticipated Copernicus\r\n      in propounding the theory of the earth's movement. He declared\r\n      that \"motion was the cause of all life.\" He forestalled\r\n      Lamarck's classification of vertebrate and invertebrate. He\r\n      takes his place, in virtue of his researches into rocks and\r\n      fossils, with the masters of modern science who have proclaimed\r\n      the continuity of geological causes. He was the first inventor\r\n      of screw propulsion. He made paddle-wheels. He attacked the\r\n      problem of aerial navigation. He invented swimming belts. He\r\n      anticipated by many years the invention of the camera obscura.\r\n      He was great alike as a civil and a military engineer. He\r\n      watered the Lombard plain by the invention of sluices; he\r\n      was one of the first to recommend the use of mines for the\r\n      destruction of forts, and he anticipated the inventions of\r\n      our time in suggesting breech-loading guns and mitrailleuses.\r\n      He shrank neither from the highest speculations nor from the\r\n      humblest contrivances. For centuries after his death the\r\n      burghers of Milan minced meat for their sausages with machines\r\n      invented by the painter of \"Monna Lisa.\"\r\n\r\n      This marvellous curiosity in science and invention could\r\n      not but profoundly influence Leonardo's work as an artist.\r\n      One result is as obvious as it was unfortunate. He paid the\r\n      penalty of versatility in undertaking more than he could\r\n      fulfil. His dilatoriness is well known. He went once to Rome,\r\n      but the Pope, Leo X., offended him by exclaiming, \"Ah! this\r\n      man will never do anything; he thinks of the end before the\r\n      beginning of his work\" (He had made elaborate preparations\r\n      for varnishing his picture before he began it.) Many of his\r\n      works were thus unfinished, and others, owing to premature\r\n      experiments in material, are ruined--especially his famous Last\r\n      Supper at Milan, of which there is an original drawing at the\r\n      Royal Academy. \"Leonardo's oil painting,\" says Ruskin,--not,\r\n      however, without a touch of exaggeration--\"is all gone black\r\n      or to nothing.\" \"Because Leonardo made models of machines,\r\n      dug canals, built fortifications, and dissipated half his\r\n      art-power in capricious ingenuities, we have many anecdotes\r\n      of him;--but no picture of importance on canvas, and only a\r\n      few withered stains of one upon a wall\" (_Queen of the Air_, §\r\n      157). But Leonardo's curiosity, his wide outlook, his sense of\r\n      the immensities, added something to his art which otherwise it\r\n      might not have contained, and which is intensely characteristic\r\n      of it. Who, for instance, has ever penetrated the secret of\r\n      Leonardo's smile?--of the ineffable, mysterious, plaintive,\r\n      and haunting smile that has fascinated and perplexed the world\r\n      century after century in the portrait of La Gioconda? That\r\n      unfathomable smile, with so much of mystery and with something\r\n      of weirdness in it, was the reflection of Leonardo's mind,\r\n      which had explored the depths and heights, and ever came back\r\n      from the pursuit with the sense of the inscrutable Mystery\r\n      beyond. \"What is that,\" he asks, \"which does not give itself to\r\n      human comprehension, and which, if it did, would not exist? It\r\n      is the infinite, which, if it could so give itself, would be\r\n      done and ended.\" In the \"Last Supper,\" says M. Müntz, \"he had\r\n      realised his ideal.\" Leonardo himself would not have said so.\r\n      His was one of those lofty minds before which an unattainable\r\n      ideal ever hovers. \"It is of a truth impossible,\" said a friend\r\n      of the master to him, \"to conceive of faces more lovely and\r\n      gentle than those of St. James the Great and St. James the\r\n      Less. Accept thy misfortune, therefore, and leave thy Christ\r\n      imperfect as He is, for otherwise, when compared with the\r\n      Apostles, He would not be their Saviour and Master.\" Leonardo\r\n      took the advice, and never finished the head of Christ. But he\r\n      fixed the outward type of Christ for succeeding generations.\r\n      Apart from the credit due to Leonardo as an ennobler of style\r\n      in art, he stands out further in the history of painting as the\r\n      first who investigated the laws of light and shade. There are\r\n      \"three methods of art, producing respectively linear designs,\r\n      effects of light, and effects of colour. In preparing to draw\r\n      any object, you will find that practically you have to ask\r\n      yourself, Shall I aim at the colour of it, the light of it,\r\n      or the lines of it? The best art comes so near nature as in a\r\n      measure to unite all. But the best art is not, and cannot be,\r\n      as good as nature; and the mode of its deficiency is that it\r\n      must lose some of the colour, some of the light, or some of\r\n      the delineation. And in consequence, there is one great school\r\n      which says, 'We will have delineation, and as much colour and\r\n      shade as are consistent with it.' Another, which says, 'We\r\n      will have shade, and as much colour and delineation as are\r\n      consistent with it.' The third, 'We will have the colour, and\r\n      as much light and delineation as are consistent with it.' The\r\n      second class, the Chiaroscurists, are essentially draughtsmen\r\n      with chalk, charcoal, or single tints. Many of them paint, but\r\n      always with some effort and pain. Leonardo is the type of them\"\r\n      (compressed from _Ariadne Florentina_, §§ 18-21).\r\n\r\n      To his artistic genius and intellectual alertness, Leonardo\r\n      added great personal beauty (\"the radiance of his countenance,\r\n      which was splendidly beautiful, brought cheerfulness,\" says\r\n      Vasari, \"to the heart of the most melancholy\") and great\r\n      physical strength. He could bend a door-knocker, we are told,\r\n      or a horse-shoe as if it were lead. He was left-handed and\r\n      wrote from right to left. Besides his physical strength,\r\n      Vasari mentions his kindness and gentleness, and tells us\r\n      how he would frequently buy caged birds from the dealers, in\r\n      order to give them back their liberty. Scandalous accusations\r\n      were at one time brought against him, but researches made\r\n      in the archives during the last few years have effectually\r\n      disposed of the charge. One curious trait in the character\r\n      of Leonardo remains to be noticed. In his art he created a\r\n      feminine type of extraordinary and haunting beauty. \"And yet,\"\r\n      says his latest biographer, \"Leonardo, like Donatello, was\r\n      one of those exceptionally great artists in whose life the\r\n      love of woman seems to have played no part.... The delights\r\n      of the mind sufficed him. He himself proclaimed it in plain\r\n      terms. _Cosa bella mortal passa e non arte._' Fair humanity\r\n      passes, but art endures.'\" This extraordinary man was the son\r\n      of a peasant-mother, Caterina, and was born out of wedlock,\r\n      his father being a Florentine notary; and amongst Leonardo's\r\n      manuscripts is a record of a visit to Caterina in the hospital,\r\n      who soon after his father's death had married in her own\r\n      station, and of expenses paid for her funeral. His life has\r\n      three divisions--thirty years at Florence, nearly twenty years\r\n      at Milan, then nineteen years of wandering, till he sinks to\r\n      rest under the protection of the King of France. (1) Leonardo\r\n      was the pupil of Verrocchio (see 296), \"a master well chosen,\r\n      for in his earnest and discursive mind were many points of\r\n      contact with that of his illustrious pupil.\" Leonardo seems\r\n      to have retained his connection with Verrocchio until 1477,\r\n      but the records of his Florentine period are very scanty. His\r\n      earliest undoubted work is the unfinished \"Adoration\" in the\r\n      Uffizi. To this period also belongs the head of the \"Medusa\" in\r\n      that collection, celebrated in Shelley's verses--a work, says\r\n      Mr. Pater, in which \"the fascination of corruption penetrates\r\n      in every touch its exquisitely finished beauty.\" (2) In 1483\r\n      Leonardo removed to Milan to take service with Ludovico Sforza.\r\n      He served his patron in those multifarious ways for which\r\n      his talents fitted him,--as musician and improvisatore, as\r\n      director of court pageants, as sculptor, painter, and civil\r\n      and military engineer. To this Milanese period belong two of\r\n      the master's most celebrated productions--the present picture\r\n      and the \"Last Supper,\" executed in oil colours on an end wall\r\n      of the refectory in the Dominican Convent of S. Maria della\r\n      Grazia. At Milan, Leonardo founded the famous Vincian Academy\r\n      of Arts over which he presided, which attracted so many pupils,\r\n      and which may be said to have established a new Milanese\r\n      School. For his Academy he made the elaborate notes for a\r\n      Treatise on Painting which were posthumously published.(3) In\r\n      1500, consequent upon the flight of the Duke before the French\r\n      army, Leonardo left Milan and returned to Florence. His stay,\r\n      however, was not long, for he took service for a time with\r\n      Cæsar Borgia as architect and military engineer. He was again\r\n      in Florence in 1503, and was commissioned with Michelangelo to\r\n      paint the Hall of Council in the Palace of the Signory. His\r\n      subject was the Battle of Anghiari. The painting was begun\r\n      but never completed. The cartoon, now lost, remained and\r\n      excited the greatest admiration, \"The man who had presented\r\n      the solemn moment of the Last Supper with a dignity and pathos\r\n      never equalled, who could portray feminine loveliness with\r\n      a sweetness and grace peculiar to his pencil, was no less\r\n      successful in bringing before the eye the turmoil of battle and\r\n      the fierce passions inspired by the struggle for victory.\" One\r\n      great work of his of this period (1504) happily survives--the\r\n      famous portrait of Monna Lisa, known as La Gioconda, in the\r\n      Louvre. For the next ten years (1506-1516), Leonardo alternated\r\n      between Milan, Florence, and Rome. Other works of this period\r\n      are the \"St. Anne\" and \"St. John,\" also in the Louvre. In 1516\r\n      he accompanied the French King, Francis I., to France, who\r\n      lodged him and his faithful friend Melzi in the Château de\r\n      Cloux, near Amboise. Three years later he died, having made\r\n      his will (the text of which has recently been discovered) a\r\n      week before the end--\"considering the certainty of death and\r\n      the uncertainty of the hour, of its approach.\" He was buried,\r\n      by his own instructions, in the church of St. Florentin at\r\n      Amboise. Of Leonardo as a young man, no authentic portraits\r\n      exist. In the Royal Collection at Windsor and at Turin there\r\n      are portraits of himself in red chalk; and on the Sacro Monte\r\n      at Varallo, one of Gaudenzio Ferrari's sculptured figures\r\n      is a portrait of the great master. Leonardo's drawings are\r\n      very beautiful and numerous--the Windsor Collection being the\r\n      richest; they show us with what infinite searching the master\r\n      drew near to his ideals. The picture before us makes upon the\r\n      spectator the impression of rapid and spontaneous creation;\r\n      but the drawings for it show that it was in fact one of the\r\n      most laborious of Leonardo's works (see on this subject Müntz's\r\n      _Leonardo da Vinci_, i. 162 in the English translation. This\r\n      is the best life of the master. The most penetrative study of\r\n      Leonardo remains Mr. Pater's, in his _Renaissance_).\r\n\r\nThis beautiful picture is very characteristic of Leonardo in its\r\neffects of light and shade, in grace and refinement of delineation, in\r\nfelicity of gesture, and in the curious beauty of the types. Leonardo\r\nmakes out of his subject a charming idyll, into which the spectator\r\nmay read his own meanings. \"In St. John the Baptist,\" says Lomazzo,\r\nwriting in 1584, \"we may see the motive of obedience and child like\r\nveneration, as he kneels with joined hands and bends towards Christ; in\r\nthe Virgin, the feeling of happy meditation as she beholds this act;\r\nin the angel, the idea of angelic gladness, as he ponders the joy that\r\nshall come to the world from this mystery; and in the Infant Christ we\r\nbehold divinity and wisdom. And therefore the Virgin kneels, holding\r\nSt. John with her right hand and extending her left, and the angel\r\nlikewise supports Christ, who, seated, regards St. John and blesses\r\nhim.\" A modern poet, adding to the picture a beautiful thought of\r\nhis own, has suggested that in the valley of the shadow of death the\r\nVirgin brings the soul of a dead child for her son's blessing (see an\r\ninteresting discussion of \"The Louvre Sonnets of Rossetti,\" by W. M.\r\nHardinge, in _Temple Bar_, March 1891):--\r\n\r\n    Mother, is this the darkness of the end,\r\n        The Shadow of Death? and is that outer sea\r\n        Infinite imminent Eternity?[212]\r\n    And does the death-pang by man's seed sustain'd\r\n    In Time's each instant cause thy face to bend\r\n        Its silent prayer upon the Son, while He\r\n        Blesses the dead with His hand silently\r\n    To His long day which hours no more offend?\r\n    Mother of grace, the pass is difficult,\r\n        Keen as these rocks, and the bewildered souls\r\n          Throng it like echoes, blindly shuddering through.\r\n        Thy name, O Lord, each spirit's voice extols,\r\n          Whose peace abides in the dark avenue\r\n    Amid the bitterness of things occult.\r\n\r\n  D. G. ROSSETTI: _Sonnets and Ballads_.\r\n\r\nThe landscape from which the picture takes its title is remarkable.\r\nLeonardo, a pioneer in so many other things, was a pioneer also in\r\nAlpine exploration, and has even been credited with a first ascent\r\nin the Monte Rosa range. However this may be, it is clear from his\r\npictures and drawings that his mineralogical and geological studies\r\nattracted him to the curious rocks and peaks which he had observed\r\namong the mountains of North Italy.[213] \"In him,\" says Mr. Pater,\r\n\"first appears the taste for what is _bizarre_ or _recherché_ in\r\nlandscape; hollow places full of the green shadow of bituminous rocks,\r\nridged reefs of trap-rock which cut the water into quaint sheets of\r\nlight; all solemn effects of moving water; you may follow it springing\r\nfrom its distant source among the rocks on the heath of the 'Madonna\r\nof the Balances,' passing as a little fall into the treacherous calm\r\nof the 'Madonna of the Lake,' next, as a goodly river below the cliffs\r\nof the 'Madonna of the Rocks,' stealing out in a network of divided\r\nstreams in 'La Gioconda' to the sea-shore of the 'St. Anne.' It is the\r\nlandscape not of dreams or of fancy, but of places far withdrawn.\"\r\nNotice also the flowers of the foreground. \"Leonardo paints flowers\r\nwith such curious felicity that different writers have attributed to\r\nhim a fondness for particular flowers, as Clement the cyclamen, and Rio\r\nthe jasmine; while at Venice there is a stray leaf from his portfolio\r\ndotted all over with studies of violets and the white rose.\" \"This\r\nwork,\" says Ford Madox Brown, \"seems to have been laid in entirely\r\nwith ivory black, which, as its wont is, has come through the upper\r\npainting to the extent of leaving only to look at a picture in black,\r\nheightened, in the lights, with a little faint yellow. So much is true,\r\nand also that the rocks, from which the picture takes its name, are of\r\nthe most singular formations, such as no modern geologist would care to\r\nlecture on, the herbage being much the same as to its botanical value.\r\nBut in spite of these and other objections, such is the intrinsic\r\npower of the work in style of drawing and beauty of expression, that\r\nnothing known, not by the greatest masters, can do more than hold their\r\nown against it. Just stand a little way off, study the heads, and see\r\nwhat they tell you--most supreme master of the human face divine\"\r\n(_Magazine of Art_, 1890, p. 135).\r\n\r\n      There is, as everyone knows, a very similar picture to this\r\n      in the Louvre; and during the last few years an Anglo-French\r\n      dispute has raged furiously in artistic circles with regard\r\n      to the authenticity, priority, and relative merits of the two\r\n      pictures. The pedigree of our picture is singularly complete,\r\n      and there can be no doubt that it is a veritable work by the\r\n      hand of Leonardo. It agrees minutely with the description given\r\n      by Lomazzo (in 1584) of a painting by Leonardo, which in his\r\n      time was in the chapel of the Conception in the church of S.\r\n      Francesco at Milan. The picture in the Louvre differs from\r\n      Lomazzo's description in the one essential difference between\r\n      the two pictures. In the Louvre picture the angel looks towards\r\n      us and points to St. John, thus connecting the spectator with\r\n      what is taking place. In our picture, on the other hand, there\r\n      is no such connecting link. The action is complete within\r\n      itself. The spectator is not invited to participate in what is\r\n      to him a divine vision. It is clear therefore that our picture\r\n      is the one which, in 1584, was in S. Francesco at Milan, and\r\n      which passed for a work by Leonardo. External evidence has come\r\n      to light during the last few years proving what had hitherto\r\n      only been taken for granted, namely, that Leonardo did execute\r\n      the central composition of the altar-piece for that church.\r\n      This is a memorial from Ambrogio di Predis and Leonardo da\r\n      Vinci to the Duke of Milan, praying him to intervene in a\r\n      dispute which had arisen between the petitioners and the\r\n      brotherhood \"della Concezione\" with regard to the price to\r\n      be paid for certain works of art furnished by them for the\r\n      chapel of the brotherhood in S. Francesco. The brotherhood had\r\n      priced the oil-painting of Our Lady executed by Leonardo at\r\n      only 25 ducats, whereas it was worth 100 ducats, as shown by\r\n      the account and proved by the fact that certain persons were\r\n      found willing to purchase it at that price. No evidence is\r\n      forthcoming as to the settlement of the dispute. We have then\r\n      these facts: that Leonardo painted a picture of Our Lady for S.\r\n      Francesco, that such a picture was in the church in 1584, and\r\n      that our picture precisely agrees with Lomazzo's description of\r\n      it. The picture remained in the chapel until some time between\r\n      1751 and 1787. In the latter year Bianconi, in a guide-book to\r\n      Milan, states that the two side panels (1661, 1662) were still\r\n      there, but that the picture \"by the hand of Leonardo\" had been\r\n      removed. In 1777 our picture was brought to England by Gavin\r\n      Hamilton, and sold by him to the Marquis of Lansdowne, from\r\n      whom it afterwards passed by exchange into the collection of\r\n      the Earl of Suffolk at Charlton Park. From Lord Suffolk it was\r\n      bought in 1880 for the National Gallery, the price being £9000.\r\n\r\n      It will thus be seen that the external evidence in favour of\r\n      this picture being a veritable work by Leonardo is unusually\r\n      strong. Internal evidence is more difficult to bring to the\r\n      test, resting as it does on æsthetic considerations, the\r\n      force of which depends on the authority of the witness and\r\n      the competence of the court to which he appeals. Several\r\n      critics, it may be explained, had convinced themselves long\r\n      ago that the Louvre picture was the original and ours a copy.\r\n      The discovery of the new document above referred to seemed at\r\n      first to strengthen the authenticity of our picture. But the\r\n      point was ingeniously turned by the following gratuitous and\r\n      entirely unsupported theory. Leonardo, says Dr. Richter, _must\r\n      have_ sold the original to the French king, and let the church\r\n      have a copy at the low price agreed upon. Supporting this\r\n      theory in turn by internal evidence, the enemies of our picture\r\n      declare it to be \"an entirely wretched performance\" (Richter);\r\n      \"superficial,\" \"insipid,\" \"heavy,\" \"woolly,\" \"lacking in\r\n      elevation,\" \"feeble,\" in short, \"a work in which we do not\r\n      feel the real presence of the master\" (Müntz). Those who thus\r\n      disparage our picture suppose it to be a copy by Ambrogio di\r\n      Predis. To this theory, an effective retort has been given by\r\n      the purchase for the Gallery of the two wings that used to\r\n      flank the central picture. It is impossible to suppose that\r\n      the painter of No. 1662 was capable of producing our picture,\r\n      of which the skilful delineation and mysterious beauty delight\r\n      all spectators who have no preconceived theory in the matter.\r\n      It should be stated that some of the faults found with our\r\n      picture are admitted by the authorities of the Gallery. \"The\r\n      ill-drawn gilt _nimbi_ over the heads of the three principal\r\n      figures, as well as the clumsy reed cross which rests on St.\r\n      John's shoulder, are additions of a comparatively late period,\r\n      probably of the 17th century.\" Again, \"the hand of the Virgin\r\n      resting on St. John's shoulder is obviously the mere daub of a\r\n      picture restorer.\"\r\n\r\n      Those who support the authenticity of our picture do not feel\r\n      called upon to carry the war into the enemy's camp, though both\r\n      Sir Frederick Burton and Sir Edward Poynter notice various\r\n      defects and repaintings in the Louvre picture, and the former\r\n      points out that its pedigree does not extend back beyond 1642.\r\n      The fact seems to be that neither picture can properly be\r\n      called a copy of the other. The most striking difference--that\r\n      in the attitude of the angel--is fundamental, and not such\r\n      as a copyist would venture to make. There are many other\r\n      differences; indeed no single part of the groups is really\r\n      alike; and those differences (as Sir Edward Poynter shows) are\r\n      such as an artist would make in working from different studies.\r\n      Studies for portions of both pictures exist. A further question\r\n      in dispute is which of the two versions is the earlier. To\r\n      Sir Edward Poynter \"it seems that our picture shows traces of\r\n      Leonardo's training in the school of Verrocchio, and that it is\r\n      the Louvre picture which has more of the idealised refinement\r\n      of type on which Luini formed his style.\" To Mr. Claude\r\n      Phillips, on the other hand, the angel of the Louvre looking\r\n      straight out of the picture seems to be essentially Florentine,\r\n      and to belong specifically to the school of Verrocchio (see 296\r\n      in our Gallery). The variation in the angel's attitude, as\r\n      given in our version, is in conception a distinct improvement:\r\n      it makes the picture more self-contained. \"One can imagine,\"\r\n      says Mr. MacColl, \"Leonardo, on second thoughts, judging that\r\n      the Louvre angel drew too much attention to himself by his\r\n      pointing hand, and was better within the picture with downcast\r\n      eyes than when inviting the attention of the spectator by his\r\n      regard.\" (The very interesting discussion summarised above is\r\n      contained in the following English publications: Dr. Richter,\r\n      in the _Art Journal_ for June 1894; replied to by Sir Edward\r\n      Poynter in the same magazine for August, and by Sir F. Burton\r\n      in the _Nineteenth Century_ for July 1894. See also Eugene\r\n      Müntz's _Leonardo da Vinci_, vol. i. ch. vi.; the _Catalogue of\r\n      Milanese Pictures_ at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1898, pp.\r\n      li.-lvi.; Mr. Claude Phillips in the _National Review_, Dec.\r\n      1894; and \"D.

PORTRAIT OF A MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Sir Antonio More_ (Flemish: 1512-1578).\r\n\r\n      Antonij Mor (commonly known in this country as Sir Antonio\r\n      More, though when and by whom he was knighted does not appear)\r\n      succeeded Holbein as the principal portrait-painter settled in\r\n      England. \"Mor's style,\" it has been said, \"so much resembles\r\n      that of Holbein as to frequently create a doubt to which of\r\n      them a portrait is to be attributed; but he is not so clear\r\n      and delicate in his colouring, perhaps from having painted so\r\n      much in Spain, as that master.\" He was born at Antwerp and\r\n      studied under Schorel (see 720). An example of his earlier\r\n      manner, dated 1544, is in the Berlin Museum. Mor afterwards\r\n      travelled in Italy, and quickly emancipated himself from the\r\n      dry manner of Schorel, as his portrait of Cardinal Granvelle\r\n      at Vienna, done in 1549, shows. His portraits from this time\r\n      forward are remarkable for their \"unpretentious dignity.\"\r\n      Cardinal Granvelle introduced him to the service of Charles\r\n      V., by whom he was sent to Portugal to paint some of the royal\r\n      family. He was in the service of Queen Mary from 1554 to 1558.\r\n      She presented him with a hundred pounds and a gold chain, and\r\n      allowed him a hundred pounds a quarter. He was also largely\r\n      employed by the Howards and the Russells and others, grandees\r\n      of the court. One of his portraits of the Queen is in the Duke\r\n      of Wellington's Collection at Apsley House. When Philip went\r\n      to Spain to take possession of the throne, Mor accompanied\r\n      him, and for some time basked in the full sunshine of royal\r\n      favour. Suddenly he withdrew to Brussels, for some cause which\r\n      has never been satisfactorily explained. According to one\r\n      story, the king, visiting Mor's studio, laid his hand upon\r\n      his shoulder as he stood at the easel--a familiarity which\r\n      the artist returned by rudely rapping the royal knuckles with\r\n      his maulstick, or daubing them with carmine. The officers of\r\n      the Inquisition took advantage of this incident, it is said,\r\n      to vent their jealous wrath against the painter. He finally\r\n      established himself at Antwerp, his declining years being spent\r\n      in ease and opulence--the fruits of successful industry at the\r\n      courts of England, Portugal, and Spain. He is described to\r\n      us as \"very much the courtier, and a gentleman of grave and\r\n      majestic manners\"--a description borne out by the fine portrait\r\n      of himself at Althorp.\r\n\r\n\r\n1095. PORTRAIT OF ANNA MARIA SCHURMANN.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Lievens_ (Dutch: 1607-1674).\r\n\r\n      Lievens, painter and engraver, \"was a comrade of Rembrandt, but\r\n      conceived a strong admiration for Van Dyck, traces of which\r\n      are to be found in his portraits\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_,\r\n      p. 115). From 1631 to 1635 he was in England, where he painted\r\n      the portraits of Charles I. and his Queen, and of several of\r\n      the nobility. He afterwards worked at Antwerp, Leyden, and\r\n      Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThis lady (born at Cologne in 1607) was one of the most remarkable\r\npersonages of her time. So great was the renown of her learning that\r\nQueen Christina of Sweden went to visit her. She was familiar with\r\nGerman, Dutch, French, Italian, and English; and was a good scholar in\r\nLatin, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic. She corresponded\r\nwith some of the most erudite men of the day, and excelled in many\r\nof the fine arts. Late in life she fell under the influence of the\r\nnoted Pietist leader, Jean de la Badie, whose cause she persuaded the\r\nPrincess Palatine Elizabeth to espouse. After his death (in 1674) she\r\ncollected his disciples at Wierwerd, where she herself died four years\r\nlater in complete destitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n1096. A HUNTING SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Baptist Weenix_ (Dutch: 1621-1660).\r\n\r\n      Weenix, born at Amsterdam, was the son of an architect. His\r\n      master in painting was Abraham Bloemaert. Early in life he\r\n      married the daughter of Gilles de Hondecoeter; his nephew\r\n      Melchior Hondecoeter (No. 202) was afterwards his pupil. In\r\n      1642 his desire to see Italy caused him to leave his young\r\n      wife and to carry his palette and brushes beyond the Alps. He\r\n      promised to be absent only four months. He remained in Italy\r\n      four years. While there he studied the coast-scenes, the\r\n      people, and the architecture; \"the result of his observations\r\n      being the stately scenes, half real, half conventional, of\r\n      which good examples are to be found in the Wallace Collection.\"\r\n      On his return to Holland, Weenix was largely employed, first at\r\n      Amsterdam, and afterwards at Utrecht. In this country his name\r\n      is chiefly associated with pictures of dead game, but subjects\r\n      of this class--in which his son (238) also excelled--were only\r\n      the predilection of his later years.\r\n\r\n\r\n1098. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Montagna_ (Venetian: about 1450-1523). _See_ 802.\r\n\r\nThe Child lies asleep on a window-sill. The Mother stands in an\r\nattitude of devotion. A picture of fine feeling, and characteristic of\r\nthe artist's \"exalted naturalism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1100. A SCENE IN A PLAY.\r\n\r\n  _Pietro Longhi_ (Venetian: 1702-1762).\r\n\r\n      Pietro Longhi, who studied in Bologna, but afterwards settled\r\n      in his native Venice, was one of the four masters who made\r\n      a partial revival of Venetian painting in the eighteenth\r\n      century--the other three being Tiepolo (1692-1769, see 1192),\r\n      Canaletto (1697-1768, see 127), and Guardi (1712-1793, see\r\n      210). Longhi represented the Vanity Fair of Venice at his epoch\r\n      with fidelity and kindly feeling. He has been called \"the\r\n      Italian Hogarth,\" but he is greatly inferior in every respect\r\n      to that painter. Moreover he was not a satirist like Hogarth,\r\n      and there is more truth in the description of him as \"the\r\n      Goldoni of painters\"--Goldoni, the popular playwright, with\r\n      whom Longhi was nearly contemporary, and who, like him, just\r\n      reflects \"the shade and shine of common life, nor renders as it\r\n      rolls grandeur and gloom.\" \"Longhi used to tell Goldoni that\r\n      they were brethren in art. Longhi surveyed human life with the\r\n      same kindly glance and the same absence of gravity or depth of\r\n      intuition as Goldoni. They both studied nature, but nature only\r\n      in her genial moods. They both sincerely aimed at truth, but\r\n      avoided truths which were sinister or painful\" (J. A. Symonds,\r\n      in the _Century Guild Hobby Horse_, April 1889). Longhi was\r\n      the son of a goldsmith, and as a lad showed unusual skill in\r\n      designs for ornamental plate: hence the affectionate partiality\r\n      in his pictures for the minutest details of decorative\r\n      furniture, dress, and articles of luxury.\r\n\r\nThe engraved portrait on the wall is inscribed \"Gerardo Sagredo di\r\nMorei,\" and perhaps the picture is a group of the Sagredo family, for\r\nwhose palace in Venice Longhi painted some frescoes in 1734. The family\r\npreferred, perhaps, to be taken in the characters of a scene in a play\r\nof Goldoni's or some other popular writer--just as in the \"Vicar of\r\nWakefield\" they resolved to be drawn together, in one large historical\r\npiece. \"This would be cheaper, since one frame would serve for all, and\r\nit would be infinitely more genteel; for all families of any taste were\r\nnow drawn in the same manner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1101. MASKED VISITORS AT A MENAGERIE.\r\n\r\n  _Pietro Longhi_ (Venetian: 1702-1762). _See 1100._\r\n\r\nA characteristic glimpse of Venetian life a hundred years ago. \"At that\r\ntime,\" it has been said, \"perhaps people did not amuse themselves more\r\nat Venice than elsewhere, but they amused themselves differently. It\r\nis this seizing on peculiarities, on local and characteristic details,\r\nthat makes Longhi's little canvases so curious.\" Here he shows us two\r\nladies in dominoes, escorted by a cavalier, at a menagerie. The trainer\r\nexhibits a rhinoceros to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n1102. THE CHEVALIER ANDREA TRON.\r\n\r\n  _Pietro Longhi_ (Venetian: 1702-1762). _See 1100._\r\n\r\nThe portrait of \"a procurator of St. Mark's,\" a dignity in the Venetian\r\nState second only to that of Doge. The procurators were charged with\r\nthe legal administration of all the affairs of St. Mark's, and their\r\nofficial palaces (the Procuratie) adjoined the church. They were\r\nfurther charged with the care of orphans, and with the administration\r\nof others who cared to put themselves \"in chancery.\" The office was\r\nthus not unlike that of an English Lord Chancellor, and there is a\r\n\"grandmotherliness\" about this procurator that makes one think he must\r\nhave discharged some of his duties well. The broad golden stole over\r\nhis shoulder shows him to have been also a knight of the order of the\r\n_Stola d'Oro_, as the Procurator's stole was of crimson velvet. The\r\npicture is in its original frame, surmounted by the armorial bearings\r\nof the Tron family.\r\n\r\n\r\n1103. VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Fiorenzo di Lorenzo_ (Umbrian: 1472-1521).\r\n\r\n      These are the dates not of his birth and death (which are\r\n      unknown), but of the earliest and latest events recorded of\r\n      him. In 1472 he was commissioned to paint an altar-piece, the\r\n      principal parts of which may now be seen in the Pinacoteca\r\n      of Perugia, and he was elected a member of the Town Council\r\n      of Perugia. In 1521 he was commissioned to value some works\r\n      by another painter. The resemblance of his style to that of\r\n      Benozzo Gozzoli may be seen by comparing No. 283. Fiorenzo's\r\n      work is best seen in Perugia, where he reveals himself as an\r\n      artist of great feeling and ability. Especially remarkable\r\n      is the series of scenes from the life of Bernardino (some\r\n      reproduced by the Arundel Society). (See for notices of this\r\n      painter Morelli's _German Galleries_, p. 263, and S. Brinton's\r\n      _Renaissance in Italian Art_, pt. iii. pp. 108, 141).\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figures are--in front of the throne, St. Francis (on\r\nthe right of the Child), St Bernardino, a saint of Siena (on the left),\r\nand in smaller size the donor of the altar-piece. This is one of the\r\nearliest examples in the Gallery of the introduction of portraits in\r\nthis way. In the left-hand compartment St. John the Baptist; and in\r\nthe right-hand one St. Bartholomew, carrying his familiar attribute--a\r\nblood-stained knife, the instrument of his martyrdom. The compartments\r\ncontaining the figures of St. John the Baptist and St. Bartholomew\r\nwere originally at one side of the central panel, but have been placed\r\non each side for symmetry, the corresponding twin panels being lost.\r\nNotice the beautiful pattern engraved on the gold background.\r\n\r\n\r\n1104. THE ANNUNCIATION.\r\n\r\n  _Giannicola Manni_ (Umbrian: 1475-1544).\r\n\r\n      Born at Città della Pieve, the native town of Perugino, whose\r\n      pupil and assistant he became. Several of his works may be\r\n      seen in the Pinacoteca at Perugia, of which town he was a\r\n      magistrate. He also executed the frescoes in the chapel\r\n      attached to the Sala del Cambio.\r\n\r\nNotice the quaint \"arabesques\" on the Virgin's prie-dieu, or\r\npraying-stool; they are characteristic of this painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n1105. THE PROTHONOTARY-APOSTOLIC, JULIANO.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo Lotto_ (Venetian: 1480-1555). _See 699._\r\n\r\nSee for the subject under 1024. \"A smooth-shaven old man with a face\r\nthat one would not be in the least surprised to see to-day anywhere,\r\nand least of all in England. As a portrait, it is the quietest of all\r\nthose by Lotto known to me, and--if I may be allowed the word--the most\r\n'gentlemanly'\" (Berenson: _Lorenzo Lotto_, p. 189).\r\n\r\n\r\n1106. THE RESURRECTION.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Mantegna_ (Paduan: about 1470-1517). _See 639._\r\n\r\nNotice the classical sarcophagus of marble. The resurrection banner is\r\naffixed to a tall rod surmounted by a cross composed of golden balls.\r\n\r\n\r\n1107. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _Niccolò da Foligno_ (Umbrian: 1430-1492).\r\n\r\n      The pietism, characteristic of the Umbrian School generally,\r\n      is conspicuous in Niccolò, of whom Vasari remarks that \"the\r\n      expression of grief in his angels, and the tears they shed,\r\n      are so natural that I do not believe any artist, however\r\n      excellent he might be, could have done it much better.\" But\r\n      he often overstrained this expression into grimace. He shows,\r\n      says Morelli, the \"tendency to exaggeration which marks the\r\n      inhabitant of a small provincial town.\" He was capable,\r\n      however, of giving grace and beauty to his female heads and\r\n      heads of angels. Examples may be seen in the Brera at Milan,\r\n      and in the Vatican Gallery. It is probable that Niccolò owed\r\n      a good deal to Benozzo Gozzoli, who from 1452 to 1457 was\r\n      working not far from Foligno (see Morelli's _German Galleries_,\r\n      p. 258). Niccolò is often called Niccolò _Alunno_. The origin\r\n      of this mistake, made first by Vasari, is that on one of his\r\n      pictures he is described as \"Nicholaus _alumnus_ Flogging\"\r\n      (Niccolò, a native, or alumnus, of Foligno).\r\n\r\nIn this picture the artist seems to revel in the depiction of emotion,\r\nand (as it were) in \"piling up the agony.\" There is the same pleasure\r\nhere in the use of a new gift--that of expressing emotion--as in 583,\r\nin that of expressing perspective. The central scene of the Crucifixion\r\nis surrounded by the Agony in the Garden, Christ bearing his Cross, the\r\nDescent from the Cross, and the Resurrection. Note as characteristic of\r\nthe _genius loci_ in the Umbrian School that St. Francis of Assisi is\r\nkneeling at the foot of the cross.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this picture by the National Gallery (in 1881) had\r\na curious history. It was formerly in the convent of Santa Chiara at\r\nAquila, and on the suppression of the convent became the property of\r\nthe State. But by the Archbishop's orders it was successfully secreted.\r\nOn his death, some years later, it was conveyed to the house of one of\r\nthe canons of the cathedral, by whom it was sold to a dealer in Rome.\r\nThe dealer made a good thing out of it; he bought it for £260, and\r\nsold it (with another small picture) to our National Gallery for £1200.\r\nThe Italian Government instituted a prosecution for theft, which,\r\nhowever, was subsequently dropped for civil proceedings for damages\r\nagainst all the persons concerned, \"except the Englishman who, it is\r\nbelieved, bought the picture in good faith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1108. THE VIRGIN ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Sienese School: late 15th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n1109. THE MARRIAGE OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Niccolò di Buonaccorso_ (Sienese: died 1388).\r\n\r\n      Of this painter, who worked and held several offices at Siena,\r\n      none of the works is traceable except this signed picture\r\n      and some fragments (also signed, and dated 1387) in a little\r\n      village church near Siena.\r\n\r\n\"Remarkable, amongst other things, for the wonderful elaboration of\r\nthe gold ornaments on the dresses, and the attempt to give an Oriental\r\ncharacter to the scene by the introduction of the palm-tree, the\r\ncarpet, and the dark-faced player on the kettledrums. It is interesting\r\nalso for its notes from real life in the figure of the child, the\r\nfaces of some of the spectators in the background, the window-openings\r\nwith their poles, the figures on the right under the blind, and\r\nthe flower-pot on the sill on the left\" (Monkhouse: _The Italian\r\nPre-Raphaelites_, p. 17). For some remarks on the subject, see under\r\n1317.\r\n\r\n\r\n1109a. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _A. R. Mengs_ (German: 1728-1779).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\n      Anton Raphael Mengs, the son of a court painter at Dresden--a\r\n      post to which the boy afterwards succeeded--was taken when a\r\n      boy to Rome and set to study the works of the great masters.\r\n      He became the most celebrated representative of the Eclectic\r\n      School of painting in the eighteenth century, and played a\r\n      great part in the early days of the classic revival of that\r\n      period. In his writings, in Spanish, Italian, and German, he\r\n      elaborated his eclectic theory--the attainment of perfection by\r\n      the combination of diverse excellences, Greek designs with the\r\n      expression of Raphael, the chiaroscuro of Correggio, and the\r\n      colour of Titian. He was an intimate friend of Winckelmann,\r\n      who constantly wrote at his dictation. His work was eagerly\r\n      sought after, both at Rome and at the courts of Dresden and\r\n      Madrid, and his books enjoyed a very wide circulation.\r\n\r\nA cartoon, executed in black chalk.\r\n\r\n\r\n1113. A LEGENDARY SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n  _Pietro Lorenzetti_ (Sienese: died 1348).\r\n\r\n      This painter was the elder brother of Ambrogio Lorenzetti\r\n      (1147), and first appears as an artist in 1305. Many of his\r\n      works, or fragments of them, may still be seen in and around\r\n      Siena. Among the best is a triptych in the sacristy of the\r\n      Cathedral representing the birth of the Virgin. \"A long series\r\n      of frescoes, representing different incidents in the Passion,\r\n      have recently been rescued from whitewash in the church of S.\r\n      Francesco. They are remarkable for their vigour and harmony,\r\n      and show Pietro to have possessed great talents both as a\r\n      colourist and as a draughtsman\" (Bryan's _Dictionary_).\r\n\r\nProbably illustrative of some incident in the life of a saint--of\r\nBishop Sansovino, perhaps, the patron saint of Siena--in which the\r\nforces of the Christian and pagan religions were opposed. On one side\r\nis a pagan priest bearing a statue, supposed, from the apple in its\r\nhand, to be that of Venus. On the other is a Christian bishop engaged\r\nin some ecclesiastical function.\r\n\r\n\r\n1114-1118. THE FIVE SENSES.\r\n\r\n  _Coques_ (Flemish: 1618-1684). _See 821._\r\n\r\nCoques pays a pretty compliment to one of his fellow-artists Robert\r\nvan Hoecke (who, like a greater man, Leonardo, was an authority\r\non fortifications as well as a painter), in painting his portrait\r\nas typical of \"Sight.\" The figures in the rest of the series, if\r\nportraits, have not been identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n1119. MADONNA AND CHILD WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Ercole di Giulio Grandi_ (Ferrarese: died 1531).\r\n\r\n      Of this painter, one of the best of the Ferrarese school,\r\n      very little is known, beyond the fact that he was in the\r\n      service of the ducal house at Este. The identification of his\r\n      works is also very uncertain, for Vasari, unaware that two\r\n      painters of the Grandi family had borne the name of Ercole\r\n      (see 1127), classed the works of both under the same head. The\r\n      present picture is not signed, and was first identified as\r\n      the younger Ercole's by Morelli. This Ercole, son of Giulio\r\n      Cesare de' Grandi, studied under Francia and Lorenzo Costa,\r\n      to the latter of whom, indeed, this picture was attributed in\r\n      the foundling hospital of Ferrara, from which it comes. Like\r\n      Francia, Ercole combined the practice of other arts with that\r\n      of painting--being a gold-beater and modeller, as well as a\r\n      painter--a conjunction which is seen in this picture, with its\r\n      wealth of decorative accessories. He disputes with Garofalo the\r\n      title of \"the Raphael of Ferrara,\" a description which this\r\n      splendid picture goes some way to justify.\r\n\r\nA picture notable alike for its central idea and for its wealth of\r\ndecorative detail. In the group of the infant Saviour (a very finely\r\ndrawn figure) standing on the Virgin's knees in the act of benediction,\r\nwith St. William on the right of the throne and on the left St. John\r\nthe Baptist, is an imaginative representation of Christianity--the\r\nsoldier of Christ, with his armour on him, but bareheaded, and with his\r\nhand on the sword, on one side; the saint, with the Cross and the Book,\r\non the other. The accessories are full of decorative inventiveness,\r\nbut every detail is full of thought; they are an epitome, as it were,\r\nof all the decorative arts of the time. Note first, in the walnut\r\nwood pedestal of the throne, that the frieze at the top is a graceful\r\narrangement of dolphins, emblems of love and affection, and the base,\r\nof stags and swans (\"As pants the hart for cooling streams, so pants\r\nmy soul for thee, O God\"). In its central panel is an alto-relievo in\r\nivory, with Adam and Eve on either side of the Tree of Knowledge. On\r\neach of the receding panels is a white marble medallion of the turbaned\r\nhead of a prophet. On the _predella_ below there are, (1) beginning\r\non the spectator's right, the Nativity, (2) the Presentation in the\r\nTemple, (3) the Massacre of the Innocents, (4) the Flight into Egypt,\r\nand (5) Christ disputing with the Doctors. The ornamental details of\r\nthe marble _baldacchino_ (or canopy), like those of the throne, are all\r\nsymbolic; thus the archivolt is composed of choiring cherubim separated\r\nby pots of lilies, and the spandrils of the arch are occupied by\r\nmedallions of the angel Gabriel and the Virgin (G. T. Robinson in _Art\r\nJournal_, May 1886, p. 150).\r\n\r\n\r\n1120. ST. JEROME IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n  _Cima da Conegliano_ (Venetian: 1460-1518). _See 300._\r\n\r\nAnother of the numerous St. Jerome pictures: see under 694 and 227.\r\nThe saint has his usual company of animals. His lion is frowning,\r\nsomewhat with the same expression as in 227--as if to deprecate the\r\npenance which his master is about to inflict on himself. On the branch\r\nof the tree above is a hawk, looking on with the expression of a\r\nsuperior person--one quite too sagacious to countenance such madness.\r\nNotice also the serpent which crawls from beneath the rock on which\r\nthe Cross is placed. The picture, says Mr. Gilbert, \"is rich, even\r\nbrilliant, in colouring, and if there is a touch of oddity in the house\r\nperched upon a crag, there is loveliness in the mountain range, and in\r\nthe amber and lemon tints that streak the evening sky\" (_Landscape in\r\nArt_, p. 340).\r\n\r\n\r\n1121. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Venetian: time of Bellini).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThis portrait, when it hung in Hamilton Palace, used to be called a\r\nLeonardo. Sir W. Armstrong (_Notes on the National Gallery_, p. 24)\r\ngives it unhesitatingly to Basaiti (see 599).\r\n\r\n\r\n1122. ST. JEROME.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Theotocopuli_ (Spanish: 1548-1625).\r\n\r\n      This artist, called \"Il Greco,\" was of Greek descent and is\r\n      supposed to have studied in Venice. He was said to have been a\r\n      pupil of Titian, but his impetuous style seems rather to have\r\n      been modelled on that of Tintoretto. He settled at Toledo in\r\n      1575, and there acquired a great reputation. His picture of\r\n      \"The Parting of Our Lord's Raiment,\" which still adorns the\r\n      sacristy of the cathedral at Toledo, is, says Stirling-Maxwell,\r\n      \"truly admirable in drawing and composition; and the colouring\r\n      is on the whole rich and effective, although it is here and\r\n      there laid on in that spotted, streaky manner which afterwards\r\n      became the great and prominent defect of El Greco's style.\"\r\n      The picture in our Gallery No. 1457 in its energetic action\r\n      but faulty drawing is characteristic of him. The exaggerated\r\n      elongation of his figures is one of his common weaknesses.\r\n      The \"St. Maurice with his Theban Legion,\" which he painted\r\n      for Philip II. in the Escorial is \"little less extravagant\r\n      and atrocious than the massacre which it recorded\"; this was\r\n      painted in 1580. A year or two later he executed the \"Burial\r\n      of the Count of Orgaz\" in the church of St. Tomé at Toledo.\r\n      This is usually esteemed his masterpiece. \"The artist or lover\r\n      of art who has once beheld it will never, as he rambles among\r\n      the winding streets of the ancient city, pass the pretty brick\r\n      belfry of that church without turning aside to gaze upon its\r\n      superb picture once more.\" Theotocopuli has been described\r\n      as \"an artist who alternated between reason and delirium,\r\n      and displayed his great genius only at lucid intervals.\" His\r\n      portraits, of which there are several in the Royal Gallery at\r\n      Madrid, are often mannered; but occasionally very fine. Into\r\n      the portrait of his daughter (now at Keir) he put all his\r\n      skill; her face, with markedly Greek features, is \"one of the\r\n      most beautiful that death ever dimmed and that the pencil ever\r\n      rescued from the grave.\" Il Greco was much employed both as\r\n      sculptor and architect. He was a man of wit and learning, and\r\n      is said to have written on the three arts which he professed\r\n      (_Annals of the Artists of Spain_, ch. v.).\r\n\r\nThis picture passed when in the Hamilton Collection for the work of\r\nTitian. The inscription on the book, \"Cornaro aet suae 100-1566,\"\r\nis interpolated. The picture appears to be one of those realistic\r\nrepresentations of St. Jerome of which there are other examples by\r\nTheotocopuli.\r\n\r\n\r\n1123. VENUS, ADONIS, AND MYRRHA.\r\n\r\n  _School of Giorgione_ (Venetian: 16th century). _See 269._\r\n\r\nA picture of the golden age, entirely in the Giorgionesque spirit, and\r\noften attributed to Giorgione himself[214]--a vision of a land bathed\r\nin perpetual light and sparkling with golden sunshine. The legendary\r\nsubject which forms the theme of this characteristic pastoral is the\r\nstory of Myrrha, which may be read in Dryden's translations from Ovid's\r\n_Metamorphoses_. The principal group is Venus and her favourite Adonis\r\n(see under 34). He was the son of Myrrha, whose legend is the subject\r\nof several small groups. On the right is a woman fleeing from a man\r\nwho pursues her, sword in hand; these represent Myrrha and her father\r\nCinyras. Farther on the woman is on her knees; here Myrrha is praying\r\nto the gods to transform her--\r\n\r\n    ... Since my life the living will profane\r\n    And since my death the happy dead will stain,\r\n    Some other form to wretched Myrrha give,\r\n    Nor let her wholly die, nor wholly live.\r\n\r\nA third group shows the answer to her prayer: she is transferred into\r\nthe myrrh tree, whose \"precious drops her name retain,\" while the\r\nwood-nymphs receive her new-born babe, Adonis. In the background on the\r\nleft is represented the death of Adonis; Venus is lamenting over his\r\nbody and changing his blood into the anemone. The group in the clouds\r\nmay represent Cupid accidentally wounding his mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n1124. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Filippino Lippi_ (Florentine: 1457-1504). _See 293._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\n      By some ascribed to Botticelli.[215] \"There is an unmistakable\r\n      drawing for it in the Uffizi Collection (No. 210), which is\r\n      there ascribed to Botticelli, and which I, for one, am not at\r\n      all inclined to take away from him. My own opinion is that\r\n      there was no painter of the time who could have given so\r\n      poetically conceived a background as we have in No. 1124; the\r\n      drawing of some of the figures also speaks of itself\" (Mr.\r\n      Maurice Hewlett in the _Academy_, January 9, 1892).\r\n\r\nFor two other more highly-finished pictures of the same subject also\r\nascribed to this master see 592 and 1033. This picture, with others\r\nfrom the Hamilton Collection, was in the \"Old Masters\" Exhibition\r\nof 1873. \"The 'Adoration of the Magi,'\" wrote Ruskin to Mr. Fairfax\r\nMurray, \"had prettiness in it, but was poor stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1125. SUMMER AND AUTUMN.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Mantegna_[216] (Paduan: 1431-1506). _See 274._\r\n\r\nSummer holds a sieve for sifting the corn which she ripens. Autumn\r\nraises a goblet of wine to her lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n1126. THE ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510). _See 1034._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nA picture with an interesting history. It was painted by\r\nBotticelli[217] when he was a young man, for Matteo Palmieri (a\r\nprominent Florentine citizen). This Matteo and his wife are here\r\nrepresented on either side of the tomb in the foreground. The patron\r\nassisted Botticelli in working out the design; and between them\r\nthey made some modifications in theology, which brought them into\r\ntrouble--so early did Sandro's reforming work begin. The story is thus\r\ntold, and the picture described, by Vasari:--\r\n\r\n      \"In the church of San Pietro (Florence) the master painted\r\n      a picture for Matteo Palmieri with a very large number\r\n      of figures. The subject of this work, which is near the\r\n      side-door, is the Assumption of Our Lady, and the zones or\r\n      circles of heaven are there painted in their order. The\r\n      Patriarchs, the Prophets, the Apostles, the Evangelists, the\r\n      Martyrs, the Confessors, the Doctors, the Virgins, and the\r\n      Hierarchies; all which was executed by Sandro according to\r\n      the design furnished to him by Matteo, who was a very learned\r\n      and able man. The whole work was conducted and finished with\r\n      the most admirable skill and care; at the foot of it was\r\n      the portrait of Matteo kneeling, with that of his wife. But\r\n      although the picture is exceedingly beautiful and ought to have\r\n      put envy to shame, yet there were found certain malevolent\r\n      and censorious persons who, not being able to affix any other\r\n      blame to the work, declared that Matteo and Sandro had erred\r\n      gravely in that matter, and had fallen into grievous heresy.\r\n      Now, whether this be true or not, let none expect the judgment\r\n      of that question from me; it shall suffice me to note that the\r\n      figures executed by Sandro in that work are entirely worthy of\r\n      praise, and that the pains he took in depicting those circles\r\n      of the heavens must have been very great, to say nothing of\r\n      the angels mingled with the other figures, or of the various\r\n      foreshortenings, all which are designed in a very good manner\"\r\n      (ii. 233).\r\n\r\nMatteo Palmieri was the author of a poem called \"The City of\r\nLife,\"[218] in which he adopted Origen's thesis that the human race\r\nwas an incarnation of those angels who in the revolt of Lucifer were\r\nneither for God nor for his enemies, and explained how the soul of\r\nman could work its way back through the spheres to the very seat\r\nof deity. This \"heresy\" interprets (says Mr. Pater) much of the\r\npeculiar sentiment with which Botticelli infuses his profane and\r\nsacred persons,--neither all human, nor all divine (see above under\r\n275). It was ingeniously suggested, as we shall see, in this picture,\r\nand was entirely in accord with those \"Neo-Platonic\" ideas in which\r\nBotticelli, as a member of the Medici circle, was well versed. Matteo\r\nseems to have been afraid that his poem might bring him into trouble\r\nowing to its heretical views on the nature of angels, for he presented\r\nhis MS. to the Art of the Notaries in Florence, sealed and under the\r\nexpress condition that it should not be opened, \"so long as he lived\r\nimprisoned in this body.\" He died in 1478, and his poem fell under the\r\nexpected censure. Botticelli's picture, as Vasari says, shared this\r\nfate. The painting bears evidence of intentional injury, the faces\r\nof the donor and his wife having been scored through; nor did some\r\nof the apostles escape the wrath of these iconoclasts. Attempts at\r\nrestoration were made at some subsequent period. As the portrait of a\r\nheretic might not be exhibited in a Roman Catholic church, the picture\r\nwas covered up, and the chapel in which it stood was closed to public\r\nworship. Ultimately the book was declared innocuous, and the chapel was\r\nre-opened. The picture, however, had already been, or was afterwards,\r\nremoved from the family chapel of the Palmieri to their villa. On\r\nthe death of the last heir, it passed into the hands of a Florentine\r\ndealer who sold it to the 11th Duke of Hamilton. At the disposal of the\r\nHamilton Collection in 1882 it was bought for the National Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe picture was doubtless designed as an illustration of the closing\r\ncanto of \"The City of Life,\" in which Matteo supposes himself\r\nconducted by the Cumæan Sibyl through the Elysian Fields to Heaven.\r\nThe ostensible subject is the Assumption into Heaven of the Virgin.\r\nOn earth the apostles are represented gathered around the Virgin's\r\ntomb, from which \"annunciation lilies\" are growing; while she is in\r\nheaven kneeling in adoration before the Saviour, who has an open\r\nbook inscribed with the mystic letters Α and Ω: \"I am Alpha and\r\nOmega, the beginning and the end.\" Around the Virgin and Christ are\r\nall the hierarchies of heaven, arranged, according to the scheme of\r\nthe theologians, in three separate tiers. Nearest to Christ are the\r\nseraphs (red), cherubs (blue), and thrones (gold); these are conceived\r\nas absorbed in perpetual love and adoration round the throne of God,\r\nand are represented therefore as with heads only (the attribute of\r\nspirit) and wings (\"swift as thought\"). In relation with mankind come\r\nthe remaining orders--the dominations, virtues, powers (these last\r\nwith sceptres in their hands), and in the lowest of the three, tiers,\r\narchangels, princedoms, and angels (with their wands). \"The black vases\r\nwith golden borders in the hands of some of the angels are probably\r\nmeant for the 'golden vials full of the wrath of God' (Revelations\r\nxv. 7). Near them there are other angels, who in the attitude of\r\nexpectation point upward with their sticks; while those in the lowest\r\ncircle point down, and at the same time seem to invite those who hold\r\nvials to pour them out upon the city of Florence\" (Richter's _Italian\r\nArt in the National Gallery_, p. 28). Everywhere amongst the angelic\r\nhost are the blessed dead, and it is here that the views of Matteo's\r\npoem found expression. We have seen in Botticelli's \"Nativity\" (1034)\r\nthe same intercourse of men and angels, with reference there to the\r\nreconciling power of the \"Logos.\" Among the cherubs, we may decipher\r\nSt. James with the pilgrim staff, St. Andrew with his cross, St.\r\nPeter with the key, and St. Mary Magdalen with the casket. It is\r\ninteresting to note Botticelli's estimate of degrees in the scale\r\nof spiritual excellence. For instance, St. Catherine of Siena is in\r\nthe lowest ring among the Angels, but St. Bernard is in the third\r\nwith Principalities; Moses is among Powers, so are St. Lawrence, St.\r\nStephen, and St. Catherine of Alexandria; Virtues hold St. Bonaventura,\r\nSt. Dominic, and St. Paul; St. Francis with the Evangelists is higher,\r\nin Dominations; in the highest _Triplicitie_, as Spenser puts it, there\r\nare men--including the Baptist--mingled with the Cherubim. The angels\r\nare represented throughout as ministering spirits; and nothing in the\r\npicture is prettier than the way in which the angels are calling upon\r\nthe saints to \"enter into the joy of their Lord\"; note, for instance,\r\nthe white angel on the right in the lowest tier, and the saint in black\r\nand red. She will teach to him\r\n\r\n    The songs I sing here; which his voice\r\n      Shall pause in, hushed and slow,\r\n    And find some knowledge at each pause,\r\n      Or some new thing to know.\r\n\r\n  D. G. ROSSETTI: _The Blessed Damozel_.\r\n\r\nThere are many charming single figures; note, for instance, two angels\r\nin the lower tier in the centre; and all are characteristic of the\r\nnew type of angels which Botticelli introduced--forsaking entirely\r\nthe conventional idealism of earlier religious art, and substituting\r\nthe waving garments and flowing hair (suggestive of atmosphere and\r\nswiftness of motion) which we see in Perugino and Raphael.\r\n\r\nFinally, the picture is of topographical interest for the beautiful\r\nview of Florence and the Val d' Arno in the background--\r\n\r\n      The valley beneath where, white and wide\r\n    And washed by the morning water-gold,\r\n      Florence lay out on the mountain-side.\r\n\r\n  BROWNING: _Old Pictures in Florence_.\r\n\r\nThe precise point of view has been identified by Miss Margaret Stokes\r\nin her _Six Months in the Apennines_, pp. 261-264. Turning off the high\r\nroad, on the descent from the hill of Fiesole--\r\n\r\n      \"I got among the lanes on Monte Rinaldi near La Lastra, on the\r\n      Via Bolognese, and soon found myself among the ruined terraces\r\n      of an ancient garden, where cactus and aloe grew side by side\r\n      with brambles, periwinkles, and ivy. Having reached an open in\r\n      the thicket into which I had strayed, I was startled to see\r\n      the very scene represented by Botticelli about the year 1455\r\n      lying at my feet--the wide horizon reaching from San Domenico,\r\n      and the Apennines beyond Monte Moro, Scala, and Monte Maggio,\r\n      round the whole Val d' Arno, to San Lorenzo and the northern\r\n      boundary of Florence. Seated on the same mountain side, where\r\n      the great painter must have sat four hundred and thirty years\r\n      ago, and holding my little copy of his landscape in my hand, it\r\n      was intensely interesting to trace the objects still remaining\r\n      on which his eye had rested, and which his conscientious pencil\r\n      had outlined, and to note the changes wrought by time in the\r\n      aspect of the scene.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Stokes prints side by side with her copy of Botticelli's\r\nbackground a topographical plan of the present scene. The house on the\r\nhill above the Mugnone beyond the bridge is the Villa Palmieri, where\r\nQueen Victoria stayed in 1888. Boccaccio selected it for one of the\r\nhomes of his fair storytellers in the _Decameron_. Matteo Palmieri\r\nbought it in 1450. There, no doubt, Botticelli was often a guest, and\r\nthere the two friends may have planned this great altar-piece. \"It is\r\nperfectly in keeping with the poetic instincts of sacred painters of\r\nthe time that this great vision of Heaven should be represented as\r\nbursting on the poet in his own very home. Gazing upwards from his\r\ncypress groves into the unfathomable blue above, it is as if the sky\r\nhad slowly opened, and the interior of a vast dome were revealed,\r\nrising above three iridescent bands of light, peopled with nine\r\nsuccessive zones of sacred forms, all gazing in absorbed ecstasy on the\r\nfigure of the Divine Mother, lowliest of women, kneeling at the feet of\r\nthe Redeemer\" (pp. 261-264).\r\n\r\n\r\n1127. THE LAST SUPPER.\r\n\r\n  _Ercole Roberti de' Grandi_ (Ferrarese: 1450-1496).\r\n\r\n      This Ercole is not to be confused with the younger painter\r\n      of the same family (see 1119). Ercole Roberti was the son of\r\n      Antonio Grandi, also a painter. A drawing attributed to him\r\n      in the Louvre, representing the Massacre of the Innocents,\r\n      in which he nearly approaches the grandeur of conception and\r\n      masterly execution of Mantegna, seems to show that he had\r\n      either studied under that great painter, or had experienced his\r\n      influence. Mantua, where Mantegna lived after 1468, is at no\r\n      great distance from Ferrara. Ercole was employed at the latter\r\n      place by the dukes, from whom he received a regular salary.\r\n      Pictures by him are rare, and none is authenticated by his\r\n      genuine signature. In the Dresden Gallery are two compartments\r\n      of a predella by him, another being in the Royal Institution at\r\n      Liverpool. In these and a few other works, including those in\r\n      our Gallery, Ercole reveals himself as a thorough Ferrarese,\r\n      in his energetic rendering of life and character, and in his\r\n      careful study of details (Layard's edition of \"Kugler,\" ii.\r\n      351, and Morelli's _German Galleries_, pp. 109-113).\r\n\r\nA very dainty little work. Notice especially the painting of the\r\nbas-reliefs and of the decanters. The attitudes of the disciples\r\nbetoken respect or veneration, except that of the nearest figure,\r\nJudas, who turns away his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n1128. THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Luca Signorelli_ (Cortona: 1441-1523).\r\n\r\n      Signorelli was born at Cortona, on the boundary of Umbria and\r\n      Tuscany. By early teaching he is an Umbrian, but in style a\r\n      Florentine. Indeed, his position in the history of art is that\r\n      of forerunner of Michael Angelo. He was a pupil of Piero della\r\n      Francesca, with whom, no doubt, he acquired a knowledge of the\r\n      figure from anatomical study of the nude. His chief works,\r\n      the frescoes in the cathedral of Orvieto,[219]--executed by\r\n      the artist after his sixtieth year,--were ten years earlier\r\n      than the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel by Michael Angelo, who\r\n      was largely influenced by Signorelli's example. Like Michael\r\n      Angelo, Signorelli is intensely dramatic, and in pictures which\r\n      do not allow of the violent action to be found in his frescoes,\r\n      his figures seem to be instinct with suppressed action. \"To\r\n      no other contemporary painter,\" says Morelli, \"was it given\r\n      to endow the human frame with the like degree of passion,\r\n      vehemence, and strength\" (_Roman Galleries_, p. 92). \"To this\r\n      we may add,\" says another critic, \"that no other painter has\r\n      ever conceived humanity with the same stately grandeur and\r\n      in the same broad spirit. The confident strength of youth,\r\n      the stern austerity of middle life, the resolute solemnity\r\n      of old age--these are his themes. Signorelli is, before all,\r\n      the painter of the dignity of human life\" (Maud Cruttwell,\r\n      _Luca Signorelli_, p. 31.) He is a representative also of the\r\n      literary and classical Renaissance. He is fond of architectural\r\n      adornments in the style of his time--as in the present picture,\r\n      where the ceremony takes place in a hall or porch enriched with\r\n      bas-reliefs in circular panels and paved with square slabs of\r\n      coloured marbles. He painted the usual religious pictures, but\r\n      did not adhere to the traditional modes, and often introduced\r\n      a classical element (see 1133). It is interesting to note\r\n      that in his picture of some nude Greek gods (at Berlin) the\r\n      composition is the same as in his regulation church pictures\r\n      of the Madonna and Saints. Of Signorelli's personal life there\r\n      is a pleasant account in Vasari, whose kinsman he was. He\r\n      was a person of consequence in his native city, going hither\r\n      and thither to paint commissions, and then returning to the\r\n      discharge of his civic duties. \"He lived splendidly, in the\r\n      manner,\" says Vasari, \"rather of a noble and a gentleman than\r\n      in that of a painter.\" Not that he despised his profession,\r\n      for he expressly advised that his little kinsman should \"by\r\n      all means learn to draw, that he may not degenerate, for even\r\n      though he should hereafter devote himself to learning, yet\r\n      the knowledge of design, if not profitable, cannot fail to be\r\n      honourable and advantageous.\" Of Signorelli's own devotion\r\n      to his art Vasari tells another story, which has thus been\r\n      versified--\r\n\r\n    Vasari tells that Luca Signorelli,\r\n    The morning star of Michael Angelo,\r\n    Had but one son, a youth of seventeen summers,\r\n    Who died....\r\n    Still Luca spoke and groaned not; but he raised\r\n    The wonderful dead youth, and smoothed his hair,\r\n    Washed his red wounds, and laid him on a bed....\r\n    Naked and beautiful....\r\n    Then Luca seized his palette: hour by hour\r\n    Silence was in the room; none durst approach:\r\n    Morn wore to noon, and noon to eve, when shyly\r\n    A little maid peeped in and saw the painter\r\n    Painting his dead son with unerring hand-stroke,\r\n    Firm and dry-eyed before the lordly canvas.\r\n\r\n  SYMONDS, _Renaissance_, iii. 281.\r\n\r\nOur picture is thus described by Vasari,--for the fact that he calls\r\nit a fresco is no argument against the identification, since he often\r\nmakes such mistakes: \"In the church of San Francesco, in Volterra,\r\nthis master painted a fresco, representing the Circumcision of Christ.\r\nThis also is considered a wonderfully beautiful picture, but the Child\r\nhaving been injured by the damp, was repaired by Sodoma, whereby the\r\nbeauty was much diminished. And, of a truth, it would often be much\r\nbetter to retain the works of excellent masters, though half-spoiled,\r\nthan suffer them to be retouched by less capable artists.\" Vasari,\r\nhowever, seems to have been \"anxious to place Sodoma in a bad light\r\nwhenever he could. Damp was in all probability not the cause of the\r\nrestoration of the infant Christ. It was very likely repainted because\r\nthe public of Volterra disliked the realism with which Signorelli\r\nseems to have treated the subject\" (Richter, p. 48). Signorelli's\r\nchildren are curiously ugly: it seems as if he had no sympathy except\r\nin the painting of figures of powerful maturity. Of the fact of the\r\nrepainting recorded by Vasari there is no doubt; for the position of\r\nthe legs has been altered, their original action being distinctly\r\nshown by the incised outline still visible through the deep blue\r\ncolour of the Virgin's robe. The painting of the other figures is\r\n\"bold and resolute, the draperies sweep in broad folds round them.\r\nThe attitude of the standing woman to the right is grand, and the\r\nearnest concentration of the faces on the ceremony, and the absence\r\nof any connecting link between them and us, give dramatic reality to\r\nthe scene\" (Cruttwell, p. 40). It is interesting to note that the\r\nfigure of the operator is like the portrait of himself which Signorelli\r\nintroduced into his frescoes of the Preaching of Anti-Christ at\r\nOrvieto: the figure is, moreover, clothed in the dress of the period\r\nand of the rich materials in which, Vasari says, the artist took much\r\npleasure in dressing himself. Behind the central group is the aged\r\nSimeon, who blessed God and said, \"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant\r\ndepart in peace, according to thy word.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1129. KING PHILIP IV. OF SPAIN.\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish: 1599-1660). _See 197._\r\n\r\nThe king is younger here than in 745; hanging from his chain is the\r\norder of the Golden Fleece. Notice also that the head is not so\r\nminutely painted here as in 745; that being a bust portrait would be\r\nseen near, this being a full-length would naturally be placed above the\r\nlevel of the eye. The smaller picture might be called, in the art-slang\r\nof to-day, \"a harmony in black and gold\"; this, from the shimmer on\r\nits lace and the flashing on the rapier hilt, \"a harmony in black and\r\nsilver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange lot,\" exclaims a biographer of Velazquez, with reference\r\nto the painter's portraits of the king, \"to be the Apelles of this\r\ninactive Alexander. For thirty-seven long years always painting the\r\nsame effigy! For throughout all these years Philip's features preserved\r\na marvellous, a startling uniformity. In the black silk court dress,\r\nin the hunting suit, in the military uniform, in the white satin\r\nrobe of state, in the gilded steel armour, in the festive religious\r\nattire--kneeling, standing, mounted--the same stereotyped head is\r\nstill there with its everlasting steadfast gaze. It may change from\r\nlean to full, from the fresh smooth features of youth and those of\r\nmanhood, marked by the lines of passion, to the leaden, swollen, and\r\nrigid lineaments of age; but even at a distance it is still instantly\r\nrecognised. Who can mistake the long oval, with its pale whitish\r\ncomplexion, and cold phlegmatic glance of the great blue eyes under\r\nthe high forehead, and light stiffly-curled hair, strong flat lips\r\nand massive chin, the whole overcast with an expression of pride that\r\nrepels all advances and suppresses all outward show of feeling? He is\r\nsaid to have laughed but thrice in his life; and although the statement\r\nmight be questioned, it was still good enough to point a sally in one\r\nof Calderon's plays\" (Justi's _Velazquez and his Times_, pp. 107, 108).\r\n\r\n\r\n1130. CHRIST WASHING HIS DISCIPLES' FEET.\r\n\r\n  _Tintoretto_ (Venetian: 1518-1584). _See 16._\r\n\r\nSome remarks made by Ruskin on another version by Tintoret of the\r\nsame subject are not inappropriate to this dark and probably faded\r\npicture.[220] \"One circumstance is noticeable as in a considerable\r\ndegree detracting from the interest of most of Tintoret's\r\nrepresentations of our Saviour with his disciples. He never loses sight\r\nof the fact that all were poor, and the latter ignorant; and while he\r\nnever paints a senator or a saint, once thoroughly canonised, except as\r\na gentleman, he is very careful to paint the Apostles in their living\r\nintercourse with the Saviour in such a manner that the spectator may\r\nsee in an instant, as the Pharisee did of old, that they were unlearned\r\nand ignorant men; and, whenever we find them in a room, it is always\r\nsuch a one as would be inhabited by the lower classes.... We are\r\nquickly reminded that the guests' chamber or upper room ready prepared\r\nwas not likely to have been in a palace, by the humble furniture upon\r\nthe floor\" (_Stones of Venice_, Venetian Index, under \"Moisé, Church\r\nof St.\") In front is St. Peter, placing his foot in a brazen basin and\r\nbending forward with a deprecating action--in contrast to which is the\r\nlook of cheerful and almost amused alacrity on the part of Him who came\r\nnot to be ministered unto, but to minister. Behind are other disciples\r\npressing forward with reverent curiosity. Another, in the right-hand\r\ncorner of the foreground, has raised his foot on a bench and is drying\r\nit with a cloth. To the left a female attendant holds a taper, whilst\r\nin the background are other figures, one of whom reclines before a fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n1131. JOSEPH AND HIS KINDRED IN EGYPT.\r\n\r\n  _Jacopo Carucci da Pontormo_ (Florentine: 1494-1557).\r\n\r\n      Jacopo Carucci, commonly called Pontormo, from his birthplace\r\n      of that name (a town on the road from Pisa to Florence), was\r\n      a scholar of Andrea del Sarto, and was employed with his\r\n      master in decorating the outer court of the SS. Annunziata at\r\n      Florence. His fresco there of the \"Visitation\" is, for the\r\n      grandeur of the figures and beauty of the colouring, worthy\r\n      of Andrea himself. Pontormo was one of the most original\r\n      \"characters\" among those described by Vasari. His pictures were\r\n      much sought after, but \"he would never work but at such moments\r\n      as he pleased, and for such persons as chanced to be agreeable\r\n      to him, insomuch that he was frequently sought by gentlemen\r\n      who desired to possess some work from his hand, but for whom\r\n      he would do nothing; yet at that very time he would probably\r\n      be employing himself zealously for some inferior and plebeian\r\n      person. One of the Medici had been greatly pleased with a\r\n      picture by Pontormo, and said that in reward for it he might\r\n      ask whatever he pleased and should have his wish granted. But\r\n      such was, I know not whether to say the timidity, or the too\r\n      great respect and modesty of this man, that he asked nothing\r\n      better than just so much money as would enable him to redeem\r\n      a cloak which he had hastily pledged.\" Many other interesting\r\n      tales of Pontormo will be found in Vasari--of his love of\r\n      secrecy, his curious manner of life, and the dead bodies he\r\n      kept in troughs of water, so to paint more realistically the\r\n      victims of the Deluge. This last tale is characteristic of\r\n      Pontormo's place in the history of art, which for the most part\r\n      was that of an exaggerated mannerist after Michael Angelo. In\r\n      the National Gallery we see him at his best. His portraits are\r\n      uniformly excellent, and his \"Joseph in Egypt\" is mentioned by\r\n      Vasari as his most successful work--\"whether as regards the\r\n      power of invention displayed, the grouping of the figures,\r\n      the animation of the heads, or the variety and beauty of the\r\n      attitudes.\"\r\n\r\nThis crowded and fantastic composition contains a drama in five acts\r\ndescribing incidents in the life of Joseph in Egypt (see Genesis xlvii.\r\n1-6, 13-26; xlviii. 1-14). (1) On the left Pharaoh, in a white turban,\r\nand surrounded by attendants, is met by Joseph and his brethren, who\r\nstand before him in attitudes of supplication. The youth sitting on\r\nthe steps with a basket in his hand is a portrait (Vasari tells us)\r\nof the painter's pupil, Bronzino. (2) On the right of the foreground\r\nJoseph, seated on a triumphal car drawn by naked children, stoops\r\nforward towards a man who kneels and presents a petition. (3) In the\r\nmiddle distance there is an animated group of men (\"Wherefore shall\r\nwe die before thine eyes, both we and our land?\"). (4) On the steps\r\nleading up to the circular building on the right, Joseph is leading\r\none of his sons to see the dying Jacob; he is followed by the \"steward\r\nof the house,\" a conspicuous figure in a long crimson robe. The other\r\nboy appears at the top of the steps and is embraced by his mother.\r\n(5) Inside the room Jacob is represented as giving his blessing to\r\nthe two boys, Ephraim and Manasseh, who are presented to him by their\r\nfather. The antique statues which adorn the building were often given\r\nby mediæval artists as characteristic of Egypt, from which the art of\r\nGreece was believed to have been derived (see Richter's _Italian Art in\r\nthe National Gallery_, pp. 36-40).\r\n\r\nThe removal of this picture has been blasted by a woman's curse. It\r\nwas painted for a Florentine noble, named Borgherini; and when he was\r\nexiled, the civic authorities sent to his house to buy up all its works\r\nof art, which were to be sent as a present to the King of France. But\r\nBorgherini's wife received the official with \"reproaches of intolerable\r\nbitterness,\" says Vasari, \"such as had never before been hurled at\r\nliving man: 'How then! Dost thou, vile broker of frippery, miserable\r\nhuckster of twopences, dost thou presume to come hither with intent\r\nto lay thy fingers on the ornaments which belong to the chambers of\r\ngentlemen? despoiling, as thou hast long done, and as thou art for ever\r\ndoing, this our city of her fairest ornaments to embellish strange\r\nlands therewith? Depart from this house, thou and thy myrmidons.'\" The\r\nlady's anger preserved the picture--only to be afterwards seduced away,\r\nby English gold, into the Duke of Hamilton's Collection, from which it\r\nwas bought for the National Gallery in 1882. Borgherini's commission\r\nfor the works in question is thus described by Vasari:--\r\n\r\n      \"It chanced that Pier Francesco Borgherini had at that time\r\n      caused rich carvings in wood to be executed by Baccio d'\r\n      Agnolo for the decoration of coffers, backs of chairs, seats\r\n      of different forms, with a bedstead in walnut wood, all of\r\n      great beauty, and intended for the furnishing forth of an\r\n      apartment. He therefore desired that the paintings thereof\r\n      should be equal to the rest of the ornaments. To that end he\r\n      commissioned Andrea del Sarto to paint the history of Joseph in\r\n      figures of no great size, and these our artist was to execute\r\n      in competition with other artists,\"--Ubertino and Pontormo\r\n      among the number (_Vasari_, iii. 201, iv. 353).\r\n\r\nUbertino's paintings for this sumptuous bedroom as well as that of\r\nPontormo have now found their way into our Gallery (see 1218, 1219).\r\n\r\n\r\n1132. THE VESTIBULE OF A LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n  _Hendrick Steenwyck, the younger_ (Flemish: 1580-1649).\r\n\r\n      The elder painter of this name was one of the first to give us\r\n      those architectural interiors, which later became a specialty\r\n      among various painters (see Havard's _Dutch School_, p. 53).\r\n      His son, the younger Steenwyck, adopted the same line of\r\n      art. He came to London before 1629, and was much employed in\r\n      supplying architectural backgrounds to the royal portraits by\r\n      Van Dyck and to other pictures. He died in London after 1649.\r\n\r\nA picture for architects to look at. It is the interior of a vestibule\r\ngiving access to a library, and is full of inventiveness. Notice, too,\r\nhow beautifully the accessories--the tablecloth, the vase of flowers,\r\netc., are painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n1133. THE NATIVITY.\r\n\r\n  _Luca Signorelli_ (Cortona: 1441-1523). _See 1128._\r\n\r\nA dramatic representation in one canvas of the Gospel story told in\r\nLuke ii. 1-17. _Scene 1._ \"And it came to pass in those days, that\r\nthere went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus, that all the world\r\nshould be enrolled.\" This is represented by the Roman portico behind\r\nthe central group, under which, at a long table, is seated a row of\r\nscribes, who are entering the names of the people. _Scene 2._ \"And\r\nJoseph went up ... to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife ... and she\r\nbrought forth her first-born son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes,\r\nand laid him in the manger.\" This is the subject of the central scene.\r\nBut the artist, no longer bound by conventional rules, treats his text\r\nfreely. There is no manger, but the stable is suggested by the heads\r\nof the ox and the ass at the side; and instead of the Babe being found\r\n\"wrapped in swaddling clothes,\" it is naked. Joseph, in orange and\r\ncrimson robes, is full of benevolence. The shepherds on the left are\r\nin deep reverence. The Virgin is robed in deep blue and green, typical\r\nof the depth and mystery of her divine love. In the interstices of\r\nthe central group are three angels with golden hair and rainbow-hued\r\nwings--\"calm shining sons of morn.\" _Scene 3._ On the left is a group\r\nof shepherds: \"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding\r\nin the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.\" The angel of\r\nthe Lord is appearing unto them from heaven, and they are sore afraid,\r\nshielding their eyes from the heavenly light. _Scene 4._ On the right\r\nof the spectator, and seen through an arch of natural rock, is a\r\nshepherd playing on the pipe. This figure suggests the antique; he is\r\ncrowned with ivy leaves and might almost be Orpheus. Thus, instead\r\nof representing the \"Glory to God in the highest\" being sung by \"a\r\nmultitude of the heavenly host,\" Signorelli gives us a Greek singer--a\r\nvariation thoroughly characteristic of the classical revival of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe landscape is also thoroughly characteristic of the mediæval mind,\r\nwhich loved the fields but dreaded the mountains. See here, for\r\ninstance, how lovingly the flowers in the foreground are painted, and\r\nnote the trailing ivy in the centre of the picture, as well as the\r\nflowers and ferns; whereas the rocks upon which these latter grow are\r\naltogether impossible in form and position (see _Modern Painters_, vol.\r\niii. pt. iv. chs. xiv. and xv., where the landscape of Dante, of whom\r\nSignorelli was a close student, is analysed). The artist's signature is\r\ninscribed on the frieze of the portico. Some, however, have questioned\r\nits authenticity and declare the picture to be a weak imitation of the\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n1134. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Liberale da Verona_ (Veronese: 1451-1535).\r\n\r\n      Liberale di Giacomo, of Verona, was brought up as a\r\n      miniaturist, and his works in that sort, executed before he\r\n      was out of his teens, are much admired for their fancy and\r\n      sumptuous colour. The choral books which he executed for Monte\r\n      Oliveto are now in the cathedral of Chiusi. Returning to\r\n      Verona, Liberale took to painting on a large scale, and became\r\n      one of the most esteemed artists of the Veronese School. \"One\r\n      of his best works is the Martyrdom of St. Sebastian in the\r\n      Brera, in which he has introduced an interesting architectural\r\n      background with Venetian palaces on a canal, designed with much\r\n      spirit and minuteness. In consequence of his bold and vigorous\r\n      style his works are occasionally attributed to Mantegna\"\r\n      (Kugler). Many of his pictures are still at Verona.\r\n\r\nOne of \"the small spiritless Madonna pictures which he produced\r\ncarelessly and hastily in his old age, and supplied for niggardly\r\npay to the citizens of Verona. They served as wedding presents, and\r\nLiberale has only himself to thank if this degenerate practice should\r\nhave spoilt his reputation\" (Dr. Richter in the _Art Journal_, Feb.\r\n1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n1135, 1136. THE CLEMENCY OF TRAJAN.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Veronese School: 15th century).\r\n\r\nThese two panels, which clearly formed two sides of an ornamental box,\r\nrepresent a favourite subject with Italian painters of the period. The\r\nstory is that an ancient widow of Rome stopped the Emperor Trajan as he\r\nwas about to proceed on one of his foreign expeditions, and asked for\r\njustice against the murderers of her son, who is here seen lying dead\r\non the roadway. Trajan suggested that she should wait till his return.\r\nShe replied that the emperor might be killed in battle. \"Then,\" said\r\nTrajan, \"my successor will attend to the business.\" \"But why,\" she\r\nurged, \"not decide the case at once?\" The emperor on second thoughts\r\ndid so, and the second panel shows him on the judgment seat. He called\r\nthe culprits before him, spared their lives, but made them pay heavy\r\ndamages to the widow. This incident was engraved, together with the\r\nrecord of his victories, on Trajan's column.\r\n\r\n\r\n1137. PORTRAIT OF A BOY.\r\n\r\n  _Jacob van Oost the Elder_ (Flemish: 1600-1671).\r\n\r\n      This painter was born at Bruges, and his pictures are very\r\n      numerous in his native town. He painted principally religious\r\n      subjects in the style of the Carracci, whose works he had\r\n      studied in Italy. Of his portraits, this work--signed with his\r\n      monogram,[221] and dated 1650--is the best.\r\n\r\nA boy of eleven--so the inscription on the right-hand corner\r\nstates--Mr. Pater's Sebastian van Storck, it might be.\r\n\r\n\"It was a winter scene, by Adrian van de Velde, or by Isaac van\r\nOstade.... Sebastian van Storck, confessedly the most graceful\r\nperformer in all the skating multitude moving in endless maze over\r\nthe vast surface of the frozen water-meadow, liked best this season\r\nof the year for its expression of a perfect impassivity, or at least\r\nof a perfect repose. The earth was, or seemed to be, at rest, with\r\na breathlessness of slumber which suited the young man's peculiar\r\ntemper.... Yet with all his appreciation of the national winter,\r\nSebastian was not altogether a Hollander. His mother, of Spanish\r\ndescent and Catholic, had given a richness of tone and form to the\r\nhealthy freshness of the Dutch physiognomy, apt to preserve its\r\nyouthfulness of aspect far beyond the period of life usual with other\r\npeoples. This mixed expression charmed the eyes of Isaac van Ostade,\r\nwho had painted his portrait at one of those skating parties, with his\r\nplume and squirrel's tail and fur muff, in all the modest pleasantness\r\nof boyhood\" (_Imaginary Portraits_, p. 92).\r\n\r\n\r\n1138. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea del Castagno_ (Florentine: 1390-1457).\r\n\r\n      There is a rough vigour in this picture which agrees well\r\n      with what we know of the painter. His father was a labouring\r\n      man. Left an orphan in his boyhood, Andrea herded the cattle\r\n      of an uncle at the hamlet of Castagno (whence the painter's\r\n      name). He was first stimulated to study art by chancing to come\r\n      across an itinerant painter at work on a rustic tabernacle. He\r\n      began to draw upon the walls with charcoal or his knife, and\r\n      showed therein so much ability that he attracted the notice\r\n      of Benedetto de' Medici, who took the youth to Florence and\r\n      placed him under proper tuition. Such is Vasari's story. But\r\n      Benedetto's patronage did not save Andrea from a hard struggle\r\n      with adversity. At the age of forty he is found declaring that\r\n      he had neither bed, board, nor lodging in Florence, and was\r\n      so poor that in illness he had to take shelter in a public\r\n      hospital. These declarations were made, however, in a taxing\r\n      return. Subsequently Andrea received various commissions in the\r\n      palaces and churches of Florence, and from the Government. For\r\n      the latter he painted on the wall of the palace of the Podestà\r\n      the gibbeted bodies of those who were declared rebels on the\r\n      recall from banishment of Cosimo de' Medici. Most of Andrea's\r\n      works have perished; the few that remain in Florence display\r\n      \"a rude and coarse energy and an independent and original\r\n      spirit, but are seldom attractive, either in form or colour\"\r\n      (Kugler). He is said to have painted in oil, but no work by him\r\n      in that medium exists. Vasari's story in this connection, that\r\n      he assassinated Domenico Veneziano, is demonstrably false (see\r\n      under 766).\r\n\r\nThis picture is impressive in its solemn gloom. The impenitent thief\r\nwrithes in agony, the suffering Christ casts his last glance at his\r\nmother, who, with St. John the beloved disciple, stands below in\r\nspeechless grief. \"The most beautiful in colour of all early works\"\r\n(Ford Madox Brown in _Magazine of Art_, 1890, p. 134). Andrea's\r\ntreatment of the subject, as also Antonello's (1166), is remarkable\r\nfor simplicity and realism. In most representations of the Crucifixion\r\nthe central tragedy is partially lost in the large groups of\r\nbystanders (_e.g._ 718, 1048, 1088), and various symbolical figures\r\nare introduced--as, for instance, flying angels around the cross. Even\r\nin Giotto's fresco at Padua this feature is introduced. Indeed \"in all\r\nthe pictures of the Crucifixion by the great masters, with the single\r\nexception perhaps of that by Tintoret in the church of San Cassiano\r\nat Venice, there is a tendency to treat the painting as a symmetrical\r\nimage, or collective symbol of sacred mysteries, rather than as a\r\ndramatic representation\" (Ruskin's _Giotto_, p. 149). For an example of\r\na symbolic representation, in contrast to the severe simplicity of the\r\npicture before us, see No. 1478.\r\n\r\n\r\n1139. THE ANNUNCIATION.\r\n\r\n  _Duccio_ (Sienese: about 1260-1340). _See 566._\r\n\r\nThis picture shows us the side of Duccio on which the early School of\r\nSiena still adhered to the traditions of Byzantine art. For instance,\r\nthe Greek method of symbolising light on drapery is seen in the gold\r\nlines of Mary's dress, a decorative method which Duccio was the last to\r\nuse. So, too, in the gold background, which was universal in Byzantine\r\nmosaics. This survival may be seen in all the early Sienese pictures\r\nin the Gallery. In 1188, for instance, all the landscape background is\r\ngold; so in 1140 are all the spaces between the houses; whilst 1113\r\nresembles a brilliant mosaic with gold for its groundwork.\r\n\r\nWe have here the earliest representation in our Gallery of one of\r\nthe most frequent subjects in mediæval art, and a few remarks on its\r\ndevelopment may be interesting. The subjects which artists had at their\r\ndisposal in those days were prescribed to them by religious uses and\r\nreligious conventions. Not in novelty of subject, but in individuality\r\nof treatment, was scope for the artist's ingenuity to be found. Hence\r\na comparison of pictures of the same subject by different artists and\r\ndifferent schools affords a suggestive study in the evolution of art.\r\nOne may trace by such comparisons something of the same process of\r\n\"descent with modification\" that Darwin has exhibited in the case of\r\nfish and insect, fern and flower.[222] Thus we may compare the present\r\npicture--the earliest and simplest \"Annunciation\" in our Gallery--with\r\nCrivelli's (739), which is the most ornate, and which was painted\r\n200 years later. Two pictures of the same subject could hardly be\r\nmore unlike. Duccio's is severe and simple; Crivelli's, florid and\r\npicturesque. The one is rigidly confined to the main matter in hand;\r\nthe other is crowded from corner to corner with dainty detail and\r\nlively incident. Halfway, as it were, between the two stands Lippi's\r\n\"Annunciation\" (666); there also there is much lovely detail, but we\r\nsee in a moment that \"in the Florentine, the detail is there for the\r\nsake of the picture; in the Venetian, the picture is there for the\r\nsake of the detail.\" Crivelli's picture shows us the furthest point\r\nof departure from the original type. Yet observe how much of the\r\noriginal survives. First, and this point is absolutely fixed in all\r\nmediæval representations of the subject, the angel Gabriel occupies\r\nthe left-hand side, and the Blessed Virgin the right-hand side of the\r\npicture. Often (as in Giotto's frescoes in the Arena at Padua) the\r\nsubject is divided into two halves by the intervention of the choir\r\narch. In Italy, the Annunciation was always the subject employed for\r\nthe decoration of the main entrance of church. For this purpose, the\r\nconvenient architectural arrangement was to place a relief of the angel\r\non one side, a relief of the Madonna on the other, and the doorway\r\nbetween them.[223] Similarly inside, the Annunciation was constantly\r\nemployed to decorate the blank space beside an archway, and hence\r\narose the custom of dividing the treatment. We may see examples in our\r\nGallery in the wings (interior side) of the \"Coronation\" by Justus\r\nof Padua (701), and in the terminal panels of Landini's altar-piece\r\n(580A). To this peculiarity is perhaps due the wall, barrier, or column\r\nwhich so often marks off the figure of the Virgin from that of the\r\nangel. We find it here in the Duccio; also in Fra Angelico's picture\r\n(1406), and again in Crivelli's. Sometimes, however, there is no\r\nsuch division. See, for instance, Lippi's picture (666), and Manni's\r\n(1104). There is a reason for this difference. Lippi's, no doubt, was\r\npainted to fill the space over a doorway; Manni's was the apex of an\r\naltar-piece. The decorative function of the pictures governed their\r\ncomposition. Returning to the Duccio, we may notice as a third and\r\nnearly constant element, the angel's lilies--Annunciation lilies, as\r\nthe Italians call them. Sometimes they are in a vase as here; sometimes\r\n(as in the Crivelli), the angel bears a lily in his hand. Next, it\r\nis noticeable that the action almost invariably takes place in a\r\nloggia--an arcade or cloister. The lectern or _prie-dieu_, which in\r\nCrivelli's picture and in very many others of the subject stands beside\r\nthe Madonna, is a refinement on the earliest type as seen in Duccio and\r\nFra Angelico. But whether with lectern or without, the Virgin is always\r\nrepresented with a book engaged in her devotions. Visitors who desire\r\nto trace the evolution of this subject should conclude their studies at\r\nthe Tate Gallery, where, in Rossetti's \"Ecce Ancilla Domini\" and Mr.\r\nHacker's \"Annunciation,\" modern versions of the old subject are given.\r\nRossetti's is one of the most imaginative in the whole range of art\r\n(see Ruskin's analysis cited in vol. ii. of this handbook, No. 1210).\r\n\r\n\r\n1140. CHRIST HEALING THE BLIND.\r\n\r\n  _Duccio_ (Sienese: about 1260-1340). _See 566._\r\n\r\nThe departure from conventional forms, which was characteristic of\r\nDuccio, is conspicuous in this picture. Each of the disciples has an\r\nindividual character, the entire group representing not conventional\r\nforms but living types of men. There is a piece of symbolism in the\r\nblind man who has already been healed which should not escape notice.\r\nDuccio is not content to represent the bare act of healing, but insists\r\nfurther upon the efficacy of the touch of Him who was the Light of\r\nthe World, by making the blind man drop the staff of which he has no\r\nlonger need. There is another piece of symbolism in the gradated\r\nscale by which he draws attention to the respective dignities of his\r\ncharacters--Christ being the tallest in the picture, the blind man the\r\nshortest (A. H. Macmurdo in _Century Guild Hobby Horse_, 1886, p. 119).\r\n\r\n\r\n1141. SUPPOSED PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST.\r\n\r\n  _Antonello da Messina_ (Venetian: 1444-1493). _See 673._\r\n\r\nA portrait in Antonello's second or Venetian manner. The portrait is\r\nthe more interesting from the probability that it is of the painter\r\nhimself. The inscription which so stated is said to have been sawn off\r\nby a former owner to fit the picture into a frame.[224] \"It is the\r\nlikeness of a man who is entirely self-possessed, nowise an idealist,\r\nyet one who would never be prompted to impetuous action. He has plenty\r\nof intelligence; nothing would escape those clear gray eyes;--scarcely,\r\nhowever, do they seem as if they would penetrate below the outward show\r\nof things. Considered from a technical point of view, the same subdued\r\nfeeling is apparent. In the Louvre masterpiece (which this picture at\r\nonce recalls), Antonello evidently braced himself for a supreme effort;\r\nin the National Gallery portrait we have an excellent example of his\r\npowers at his best period\" (_Times_, May 31, 1883).\r\n\r\n\r\n1143. THE PROCESSION TO CALVARY.\r\n\r\n  _Ridolfo Ghirlandajo_ (Florentine: 1483-1561).\r\n\r\n      Ridolfo Bigordi, called Ghirlandajo, was the son of Domenico\r\n      Ghirlandajo (see 1230), who gave him his first instruction in\r\n      art. On the death of Domenico, Ridolfo was taken charge of by\r\n      his uncle David, and perhaps received instruction also from\r\n      Domenico's favourite pupil, Granacci. In 1503 Leonardo da\r\n      Vinci came to Florence, and seems to have exercised a strong\r\n      influence on the young Ridolfo. To this Leonardine period of\r\n      our artist, the present picture, executed in 1505, belongs:\r\n      some of the heads (which are of great force and beauty) seem to\r\n      have been copied or imitated from Leonardo. To the same period\r\n      and influence Morelli ascribes the \"Annunciation,\" No. 1288\r\n      in the Uffizi, there attributed to Leonardo himself, and the\r\n      \"Portrait of a Goldsmith,\" similarly attributed in the Pitti.\r\n      In Ridolfo's works after 1506 the influence of Raphael is\r\n      discernible. Raphael was his fellow-student and contemporary,\r\n      and between the two congenial youths an ardent friendship,\r\n      Vasari tells us, sprang up. Raphael employed Ridolfo to fill\r\n      in part of the blue drapery of the \"Belle Jardinière\", and\r\n      invited him to Rome; but Ridolfo, \"who had never, as the saying\r\n      is, 'lost sight of the cupola' (of the Duomo), and could in\r\n      no wise resolve on living out of Florence, would accept no\r\n      proposal which might compel him to abandon his abode in his\r\n      native place.\" At Florence Ridolfo found ample and congenial\r\n      employment, not only in the production of pictures, but in\r\n      artistic catering for the pageants of the Republic, and in\r\n      the service of the Medici. He did not disdain, says Vasari,\r\n      \"to paint banners, standards, and matters of similar kind. He\r\n      was an exceedingly prompt and rapid painter in many kinds of\r\n      work, more particularly in the preparations for festivals; when\r\n      the Emperor Charles V. arrived in Florence, he constructed\r\n      a triumphal arch in ten days, and another arch at the gate\r\n      of Prato was erected by this artist in a very short space of\r\n      time, this work being constructed for the marriage of the most\r\n      Illustrious Lady the Duchess Leonora.\" Among his pictures,\r\n      the \"St. Zenobio restoring a boy to life\" and the burial\r\n      of the same saint, in the Uffizi, are considered Ridolfo's\r\n      masterpieces; they are remarkable for force of colour, and fine\r\n      modelling in the heads. Ridolfo employed a number of young\r\n      painters, and from this workshop issued many pictures which\r\n      were sold to England, Germany, and Spain. He lived to be nearly\r\n      eighty years old; and \"though heavily afflicted with the gout,\r\n      he still bore much love,\" says Vasari, \"to all connected with\r\n      art, and liked to hear of, and when he could to see, whatever\r\n      was most commended in the way of buildings, pictures, and other\r\n      works.\" He was buried with his forefathers in S. Maria Novella.\r\n\r\nOne of the pictures in the Gallery which are additionally interesting\r\nfrom being mentioned and praised by Vasari--who, by the way, was\r\nhimself a friend of Ridolfo:\r\n\r\n      \"In the Church of S. Gallo he depicted our Saviour Christ,\r\n      bearing his Cross and accompanied by a large body of soldiers;\r\n      the Madonna and the other Maries, weeping in bitter grief, are\r\n      also represented, with San Giovanni and Santa Veronica, who\r\n      presents the handkerchief to our Saviour; all these figures are\r\n      delineated with infinite force and animation.[225] This work,\r\n      in which there are many beautiful portraits from the life, and\r\n      which is executed with much love and care, caused Ridolfo to\r\n      acquire a great name; the portrait of his father is among the\r\n      heads, as are those of certain among his disciples, and of some\r\n      of his friends--Poggino, Scheggia, and Nunziata, for example,\r\n      the head of the latter being one of extraordinary beauty\" (v.\r\n      5).\r\n\r\nIt is interesting in this connection to notice that the procession\r\nto Calvary was one of the regulation subjects with mediæval painters\r\n(see for a picture of it, some two hundred years earlier, 1189), and\r\nfamiliarity bred contempt for the pathos of the scene; it became a\r\nmere opportunity for variegated compositions, and curiously enough two\r\nof the brightest pictures in the Gallery (this and 806) are of this\r\nsubject. For the story of St. Veronica see 687.\r\n\r\n\r\n1144. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Bazzi_, called _Il Sodoma_ (Lombard: 1477-1549).\r\n\r\n      The confusion in the use of the word \"school\" is illustrated\r\n      in the case of Giovanni Antonio Bazzi (sometimes wrongly given\r\n      as Razzi), called also Il Sodoma. He spent most of his life\r\n      at Siena, and is often grouped therefore with the Sienese\r\n      School. But he was born at Vercelli, in Piedmont--being the\r\n      son of a shoemaker--and \"ripened into an artist during the two\r\n      years he spent at Milan with Leonardo da Vinci\" (1498-1500).\r\n      Sodoma is therefore, says Morelli (_German Galleries_, p.\r\n      428), to be reckoned as one of the Milanese-Lombard School.\r\n      \"Nay, I believe I should not be far wrong were I to maintain\r\n      that the majority of the better works ascribed to Leonardo in\r\n      private collections are by him.... Young Bazzi while at Milan\r\n      seems to have taken Leonardo for his model, not only in art,\r\n      but even in personal appearance and fancies. All his life he\r\n      loved to play the cavalier, and, like Leonardo, always kept\r\n      saddle-horses in his stable, and all kinds of queer animals\r\n      in his house.\"[226] Vasari gives an amusing, though probably\r\n      apocryphal, account of his excesses, and represents him as a\r\n      lewd fellow of the baser sort, with whom no respectable person\r\n      would have anything to do. But Raphael so respected Bazzi and\r\n      his work that he introduced his portrait (erroneously called\r\n      Perugino's) by the side of his own in his celebrated fresco of\r\n      the \"School of Athens.\" But at any rate Sodoma was a careless,\r\n      jovial fellow--dividing his time between the studio and the\r\n      stable; and when cash ran short or a horse ran wrong, he would\r\n      meet his liabilities with a hastily dashed-off picture. This\r\n      very Madonna may perhaps have paid off a racing debt.\r\n\r\n      \"Sodoma,\" says a distinguished German critic, \"had a poetic\r\n      soul, full of glowing and deep feeling, a richly endowed\r\n      creative mind, but no inclination for severe earnest work\"\r\n      (Jansen). His execution is unequal, but at his best he is one\r\n      of the most attractive of all the Italian painters. No one\r\n      will deny this who recalls the fresco, in the upper floor\r\n      of the Farnesina Palace, of \"The Marriage of Alexander and\r\n      Roxana\"--\"one of the most enchanting pictures of the whole\r\n      Renaissance,\" or who has studied the painter's work in the\r\n      churches, the Gallery, and the Palazzo Publico of Siena. The\r\n      figure of \"St. Ansano\" in the latter place may be taken as an\r\n      example of the dignity which Sodoma was capable of imparting\r\n      to his types. The \"Christ bound to the Column\" in the Siena\r\n      gallery is a fine example of his power as a colourist and his\r\n      command of pathetic expression; while in the figure of Eve in\r\n      the \"Limbo\" in the same gallery, and in more than one Holy\r\n      Family, we may see his innate sense of feminine beauty and\r\n      grace. It is supposed that Sodoma went as a young man to Milan\r\n      and there imbibed the influence of Leonardo da Vinci, but this\r\n      theory (maintained by Morelli) of a close connection between\r\n      Leonardo and Sodoma is not accepted by all critics. In 1501 he\r\n      went to Siena, where, in the stagnation of the local school, he\r\n      found ample openings for his abilities. To this period belong\r\n      the series of frescoes representing the history of St. Benedict\r\n      in the Convent of Monte Oliveto. In 1507 Sodoma was taken by\r\n      the Sienese merchant, Agostino Chigi, to Rome. He began to\r\n      decorate the Camera della Segnatura in the Vatican, but the\r\n      Pope transferred the commission to Raphael. Sodoma was again in\r\n      Rome in 1514, when he painted for Chigi the frescoes already\r\n      referred to. In the interval he had returned to Siena, where he\r\n      married the daughter of an innkeeper. From 1515 onwards he made\r\n      Siena his headquarters. Copies of some of the works mentioned\r\n      above may be seen in the Arundel Society's Collection.\r\n\r\nThis picture, which is hardly a satisfactory example of the painter,\r\nis one of those supposed by some critics to have been painted in the\r\nyears 1518-20, during which he is believed to have revisited Milan.\r\nOthers place it later in the artist's career. \"Probably one of his late\r\n'pot-boilers.' It was originally in the Rossini Collection at Pisa,\r\nand may have been painted there during the last years of the artist's\r\nlife, while he was working at the choir decorations in the cathedral\"\r\n(_Sodoma_, by the Contessa Priuli Bon, 1900, p. 92).\r\n\r\n\r\n1145. SAMSON AND DELILAH.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Mantegna_ (Paduan: 1431-1506). _See 274._\r\n\r\nSamson, whose giant's strength lay in his hair, fell into the toils\r\nof Delilah (Judges xvi.), who delivered him to his enemies by cutting\r\noff his hair as he lay asleep. On the trunk of the olive tree behind,\r\nMantegna has carved the moral he drew from the tale: \"Foemina diabolo\r\ntribus assibus est mala peior\" (woman is a worse evil than the devil\r\nby the three pennies which bind you to her).[227] But though Mantegna\r\nhas taken his subject from the Bible, his treatment of it is in the\r\nclassical spirit. \"Apart from the fact that her attention is directed\r\nto the mechanical operation, Delilah's expression is one of absolute\r\nand entire unconcern. Look of cunning, or of deceit, or of triumph\r\nthere is none. Mantegna was not the man to shirk expression when he\r\ndeemed the subject required it; probably, therefore, he left the\r\nfeatures impassive in obedience to the formula of a certain school of\r\nantique sculpture, that all violent emotion should be avoided\" (see\r\n_Times_, June 18, 1883).\r\n\r\n\r\n1147. HEADS OF NUNS.\r\n\r\n  _Ambrogio Lorenzetti_ (Sienese: died about 1348).\r\n\r\n      Ambrogio, the younger brother of Pietro Lorenzetti (see 1113),\r\n      was the greatest of the early Sienese painters. His series\r\n      of frescoes in the Sala della Pace in the Palazzo Publico of\r\n      Siena, typifying good and bad government, are known to every\r\n      traveller. They are full both of artistic beauty and historical\r\n      interest (see the description by Symonds in his _Sketches and\r\n      Studies_, iii. 43). The heads of many of Ambrogio's allegorical\r\n      figures are of great beauty and grandeur--especially that of\r\n      Peace, which is of classical dignity and may possibly have been\r\n      modelled on the lines of some antique sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe work before us is a mere shattered fragment of fresco (from a\r\nchurch in Siena), but it is enough to show the artist's feeling for the\r\ntrue portraiture that identifies character with likeness. The nuns'\r\nfaces are typical of the strong yet tender qualities developed in a\r\nlife of seclusion and self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n1148. CHRIST AT THE COLUMN.\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish; 1599-1660). _See 197._\r\n\r\nAn intensely dramatic rendering of the central lesson of Christianity.\r\nThe scene depicted is an episode from the Passion between the scourging\r\nand the crowning with thorns--a scene not given in the Gospels, and\r\ninvented to produce a more vivid effect than representations of\r\nfamiliar scenes. The absence of all decorative accessories concentrates\r\nthe attention at once on the figure of the Divine sufferer--bound by\r\nthe wrists to the column. His hands are swollen and blackened by the\r\ncords; the blood has trickled down the shoulder--so terrible was the\r\npunishment--and the scourges and rod have been flung contemptuously\r\nat his feet. Yet abnegation of self and Divine compassion are stamped\r\nindelibly on his countenance, as he turns his head to the child who\r\nis kneeling in adoration. The guardian angel behind bids the child\r\napproach the Redeemer in prayer (hence the alternative title that has\r\nbeen given to the picture, \"The Institution of Prayer\"). From the\r\nwise and prudent the lessons of Christianity are often hidden, but\r\nChrist himself here reveals them unto babes. \"He was wounded for our\r\ntransgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement\r\nof our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\" A\r\nthin white line, a ray, reaches from the position of the heart to the\r\nSaviour's ear--\r\n\r\n    To see sad sights moves more than hear them told,\r\n    For then the _heart_ interprets to the _ear_\r\n    The heavy motion that it doth behold.\r\n\r\nThe angel is a portrait (a preparatory study from a model is included\r\namongst the collection of drawings made by Cean Bermudez). The\r\ndowncast eye, the slightly pouting lips, as if about to weep, betray\r\nthe harrowing expression of the moment. This expression shows fine\r\ninvention, for it might have been more natural for the eye to follow\r\nthe hand directing the child's attention to the figure. But the angel\r\nfears himself to look, lest he be overcome with grief. The tone of\r\nthe picture is in keeping with its theme. There probably exists no\r\nother painting executed in such a decidedly gray, blackish-gray tone,\r\nalthough it is by no means colourless, as seen in the orange-brown and\r\ndull crimson of the angel's costume, which are peculiar to Velazquez.\r\nIt is as if, after the terrible event that has here taken place,\r\nmourning Nature had strewn the scene with a fine shower of ashes, as\r\nafter some tremendous volcanic outburst (Justi's _Velazquez and his\r\nTimes_, pp. 241-248).\r\n\r\n\r\n1149. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Marco d'Oggionno_ (Lombard: about 1470-1530).\r\n\r\n      Marco, called Oggionno from the village near Milan in which he\r\n      was born, was one of the pupils and imitators of Leonardo. He\r\n      made several copies of the master's \"Last Supper,\" one of which\r\n      is in the collection of the Royal Academy. His best original\r\n      work on a large scale is the \"Triumph of the Three Archangels\r\n      over Satan,\" in the Brera. Among his smaller works, the\r\n      \"Infant Christ caressing St. John,\" at Hampton Court, is more\r\n      successful than most. His works, says M. Müntz, \"are wanting\r\n      in vivacity of feeling and purity of drawing, and intensity of\r\n      colour does duty for intensity of sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a characteristic example of the painter's work. He succeeded\r\nin catching a little of Leonardo's smile, \"chilled as it were on the\r\nway\" (Logan). The study in chalk for the Virgin's head is in the Dyce\r\nCollection in the South Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n1150. PORTRAIT OF A MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Pontormo_ (Florentine: 1494-1557). _See 1131._\r\n\r\n1151. THE ENTOMBMENT.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (German: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nA copy, in colour, of an engraving by Martin Schongauer (see 658).\r\n\r\n\r\n1152. ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST.\r\n\r\n  _Martino Piazza_ (Lombard: early 16th Century).\r\n\r\n      Martino and his brother Albertino were painters at Lodi,\r\n      where they worked both together and separately; there are\r\n      many altar-pieces in the churches of that place by them.\r\n      This picture is a signed work of Martino alone. The brothers\r\n      belonged to the school which was established in Milan and its\r\n      neighbourhood before the arrival of Leonardo; but in many of\r\n      Martino's work the new influence is discernible. \"The curly\r\n      hair, his high finish and chiaroscuro, derived from a study of\r\n      Leonardo, are distinctive traits\" (Catalogue of the Burlington\r\n      Fine Arts Club's Exhibition, 1898, p. lxxvi.).\r\n\r\nCompare the type of countenance and form of the rocks with those in\r\nLeonardo's picture, 1093. For the subject of this picture see under 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n1154. GIRL WITH A LAMB.\r\n\r\n  _Greuze_ (French: 1725-1805). _See 206._\r\n\r\nAn unfinished study--characteristic of the touch of affectation often\r\nvisible in Greuze's pictures of simplicity. Children fondling pet lambs\r\nare a favourite motive in art, but its treatment is seldom free from\r\naffectation. See, for instance, Murillo's St. John, 176.\r\n\r\n\r\n1155. THE ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Matteo di Giovanni_ (Sienese: 1435-1495).\r\n\r\n      Matteo, the son of Giovanni di Bartolo (a mercer),--called also\r\n      Matteo di Siena--was the best Sienese painter of his time, and\r\n      in this picture, which is perhaps his masterpiece, we have an\r\n      epitome of all the most characteristic qualities of the earlier\r\n      Sienese school--\"its warm, delicate, and transparent colouring,\r\n      its graceful outline, its religious sentiment, and its somewhat\r\n      miniature-like execution. Matteo was the last of the series\r\n      of painters who developed the art of Duccio, adhering to the\r\n      traditions of the school of which that great master was the\r\n      founder\" (Layard). In the expression of passion and dramatic\r\n      action that school was never successful, struggling to\r\n      disguise weakness by overstraining expression. This weakness\r\n      is conspicuous in Matteo's pictures of the \"Massacre of the\r\n      Innocents\" (in S. Agostino and S. Maria de' Servi in Siena),\r\n      and is not absent from his \"Ecce Homo\" and \"St. Stephen\" in\r\n      this Gallery (247 and 1461). His best pictures at Siena are\r\n      the \"Madonna della Neve\" in the chapel of that name, and the\r\n      \"Coronation of S. Barbara\" in S. Domenico. He also designed one\r\n      of the Sibyls (the Samian) on the marble pavement of the Duomo.\r\n\r\nA picture in which the artist concentrates all he could command of\r\ngaiety and joyousness in colour, expression, action, and sentiment; and\r\nthus typical of the personal feeling, approximating to that of a lover\r\nto his mistress, which entered into Madonna worship. These pictures\r\nof coronations and assumptions of the Virgin are not merely tributes\r\nof devotion to the mother of God, but are poetic renderings of the\r\nrecognition of women's queenship, of her rule not by force of law but\r\nby tenderness and sacrifice--\r\n\r\n        For lo! thy law is pass'd\r\n    That this my love should manifestly be\r\n        To serve and honour thee:\r\n    And so I do: and my delight is full,\r\n    Accepted for the servant of thy rule.\r\n\r\nOne may read the same spirit, perhaps, in the legend of St. Thomas\r\nand the Madonna, introduced in this picture--of St. Thomas, who ever\r\ndoubted, but whose faith was confirmed by a woman's girdle. For the\r\nstory is that the Virgin, taking pity on his unbelief, threw down to\r\nhim her girdle, which he is here raising his hands to catch, as it\r\nfalls from her throne, in order that this tangible proof remaining with\r\nhim might remove all doubts for ever from his mind--\r\n\r\n        Lady, since I conceived\r\n    Thy pleasurable aspect in my heart,\r\n        My life has been apart\r\n    In shining brightness and the place of truth;\r\n        Which till that time, good sooth,\r\n    Groped among shadows in a darken'd place.\r\n\r\n  D. G. ROSSETTI: _Early Italian Poets_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1157. THE NATIVITY.\r\n\r\n  _Bernardo Cavallino_ (Neapolitan: 1622-1654).\r\n\r\n      This painter was a pupil of Massimo Stanzioni (a rival of\r\n      Spagnoletto), and showed such ability that \"at first he created\r\n      a jealous feeling in Massimo himself. Finding afterwards that\r\n      his talent lay more in small figures than in large, he pursued\r\n      that department and became very celebrated in his school. In\r\n      the galleries of the Neapolitan nobility are to be seen by him,\r\n      on canvas and copper, subjects both sacred and profane. Life\r\n      was alone wanting to him, which he unfortunately shortened by\r\n      his irregularities\" (Lanzi, ii. 41).\r\n\r\nA characteristic work in the \"naturalistic\" manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n1159. THE CALLING OF ABRAHAM.\r\n\r\n  _Gaspard Poussin_ (French: 1613-1675). _See 31._\r\n\r\nA very impressive picture in spite of the somewhat grotesque angel who\r\naccosts Abraham and points him to the Almighty seated in the clouds\r\nabove (Genesis xii.). And indeed it is in his skies that Gaspard\r\npoints us to the Infinite--in the open sky, stretching far away into\r\nthat yellow horizon. To what does this strange distant space owe its\r\nattractive power?\r\n\r\n      \"There is one thing that it has, or suggests, which no\r\n      other object of sight suggests in equal degree, and that\r\n      is--Infinity.... For the sky of night, though we may know it\r\n      boundless, is dark; it is a studded vault, a roof that seems to\r\n      shut us in and down; but the bright distance has no limit--we\r\n      feel its infinity, as we rejoice in its purity of light....\r\n      Of the value of this mode of treatment (_i.e._ the rendering\r\n      of open sky) there is a farther and more convincing proof\r\n      than its adoption either by the innocence of the Florentine\r\n      or the ardour of the Venetian, namely, that when retained or\r\n      imitated from them by the landscape painters of the seventeenth\r\n      century, when appearing in isolation from all other good, among\r\n      the weaknesses and paltrinesses of Claude, the mannerisms of\r\n      Gaspar, and the caricatures and brutalities of Salvator, it\r\n      yet redeems and upholds all three, conquers all foulness by\r\n      its purity, vindicates all folly by its dignity, and puts an\r\n      uncomprehended power of permanent address to the human heart\r\n      upon the lips of the senseless and the profane\"[228] (_Modern\r\n      Painters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. v. §§ 5, 12).\r\n\r\n\r\n1160. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _School of Giorgione_ (Venetian: early 16th century). _See 269._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xx)\r\n\r\nThis picture--ascribed by Morelli and others to Catena (see 234)--is by\r\nsome connected with the name of Giorgione. It displays, says Sir Edward\r\nPoynter, \"the qualities which we should expect to find in a picture by\r\nGiorgione, and does not seem so far removed from the only absolutely\r\nauthenticated work by him--the altar-piece at Castelfranco--as to make\r\nit impossible to attribute it to his hand. In qualities of drawing and\r\ncomposition it is superior to what we know of the work of Catena\" (_The\r\nNational Gallery_, i. 23). \"The figures are Bellinesque, yet with that\r\nadded touch of delicacy and refinement which Giorgione always knows how\r\nto impart. The richness of colouring, the depth of tone, the glamour of\r\nthe whole, is far superior to anything we can point to with certainty\r\nas Catena's work; and no finer example of his 'Giorgionesque' phase\r\nis to be found than the sumptuous 'Warrior adoring the Infant Christ'\r\n(234) which hangs close by. Catena's work seems cold and studied beside\r\nthe warmth and spontaneity of Giorgione's little panel\" (Herbert Cook's\r\n_Giorgione_, p. 54). \"Whoever painted it, it is worth many much larger\r\ncanvases. The simple, flowing cast of the drapery, the general scheme\r\nof colour, and the quality of individual tints, such as the mellow\r\nyellow shaded with red, and the greenish-blue of the Virgin's mantle,\r\nare not like what I know of Catena. The lively, well-drawn child, with\r\nits supple limbs; the faces of the women, with full faces, short noses,\r\nand square jaws; the straight-necked horses, and many other things in\r\nthis charming picture,--seem to me to proclaim a distinct, if unknown,\r\nmaster. Above all things distinct, perhaps, is the particular tone of\r\nreverence--naïve, quiet, but deep--that pervades the picture, a feeling\r\nwhich can scarcely have been imitated, but must have proceeded from the\r\nvery character of the painter himself\" (Monkhouse, _In the National\r\nGallery_, p. 224).\r\n\r\n\r\n1165. ST. HIPPOLYTUS AND ST. CATHERINE.\r\n\r\n  _Il Moretto_ (Brescian: 1498-1555). _See 299._\r\n\r\nTwo saints who were not divided in the manner of their martyrdom,\r\nand who are united therefore on the painter's canvas. Each holds the\r\nmartyr's palm. St. Catherine places her left hand on the hilt of a\r\nsword--the instrument by which she was ultimately beheaded, whilst her\r\nfoot rests upon the wheel on which she was to have been torn to death,\r\nhad not an angel from heaven broken it. St. Hippolytus's death was not\r\nunlike that which had been devised for St. Catherine. He is clad in\r\narmour, for he was the soldier stationed as guard over St. Lawrence\r\n(see 747), but he is represented as bareheaded, and with his face\r\nupturned in reverence, for that \"he was so moved by that illustrious\r\nmartyr's invincible courage and affectionate exhortations that he\r\nbecame a Christian with all his family.\" Wherefore he was tied to the\r\ntails of wild horses and torn to death. On the fragment of stone in\r\nthe foreground is an inscription in Latin, telling by what death the\r\ntwo saints glorified God--\"Membris dissolvi voluerunt ne vinculis\r\ndivellerentur aeternis:\" they chose to be torn limb by limb rather\r\nthan by renouncing their faith to be thus torn hereafter by eternal\r\nchains. The members of the body are the chains of the soul, and the\r\nmartyrs freed themselves from temporary fetters rather than submit to\r\nthe fetters of everlasting punishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n1166. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _Antonello da Messina_ (Venetian: 1444-1493). _See 673._\r\n\r\nSigned, and dated 1477, two years later than the very similar picture\r\nat Antwerp. Notice the harmonious colouring, and the expression of\r\n_abandon_ and lassitude, following more poignant grief, in the Virgin's\r\nattitude, with her arms falling down on each knee. \"The subject was\r\nnever more truly felt, and the little figure of the Virgin at the foot\r\nof the cross contains in it an expression of concentrated grief I never\r\nsaw equalled. The _eyes are shut_, the hands simply rest on the knees,\r\nbut this very simplicity gives it a truth which far surpasses the\r\nextravagant attitudes of the later painters\" (from a letter by Louisa,\r\nLady Waterford, from whom the picture was purchased in 1884; see Hare's\r\n_The Story of Two Noble Lives_, iii. 77). This picture shows, says Mr.\r\nGilbert, \"the dawning loveliness of Venetian colour, as distinguished\r\nfrom the vivid beauty of the early Flemish. Instead of the minute\r\ndefinition of every object characteristic of the Van Eyck School, we\r\nfind, spread over a scene of the utmost simplicity, a delicious silvery\r\nhaze, melting into the warm tones of a shadowless foreground. In this\r\nsmall picture we may see already what Venice owed to Flanders--how\r\nVenice would enrich the gift\" (_Landscape in Art_, p. 311).\r\n\r\n\r\n1168. PORTRAIT OF A JESUIT.\r\n\r\n  _Willem van der Vliet_ (Dutch: 1584-1642).\r\n\r\n      Works by this artist are rare and very little known. He\r\n      belonged to Delft--a town as active in painting as in pottery.\r\n      This picture is signed and dated 1631.\r\n\r\nAn admirable portrait. The Jesuit father, here depicted with so much\r\nquiet truth and skill, is a good representative of the great order\r\nwhich had at that time saved the Papacy. He is a student, but the\r\ncrucifix is ever on his books. \"The Jesuits appear,\" says Macaulay, \"to\r\nhave discovered the precise point to which intellectual culture can\r\nbe carried without risk of intellectual emancipation.\" But he turns\r\nround from his book and looks with a smile of tender sadness on the\r\nspectator--he is ready to read your heart and to give you sympathy in\r\nreturn for confidences.\r\n\r\n\r\n1169. MRS. ROBERT HOLLOND.\r\n\r\n  _Ary Scheffer_ (French-Dutch: 1795-1858).\r\n\r\n      An artist who once enjoyed a great vogue (a version of this\r\n      picture was bought in 1845 by the ex-Queen of the French for\r\n      £1000), and whose pictures are historically interesting for\r\n      their extraordinary absence of the colour-sense. Ary Scheffer's\r\n      pictures, says Ruskin (_Academy Notes_, 1858, p. 40), are\r\n      designed \"on the assumption that the noblest ideal of colour is\r\n      to be found in dust,\" and what he said in 1846 of the German\r\n      School is equally true of Ary Scheffer:[229] \"Brightness of\r\n      colour is altogether inadmissible without purity and harmony;\r\n      and the sacred painters must not be followed in their frankness\r\n      of unshadowed colour, unless we can also follow them in its\r\n      clearness. As far as I am acquainted with the modern schools\r\n      of Germany, they seem to be entirely ignorant of the value of\r\n      colour as an assistant of feeling, and to think that hardness,\r\n      dryness, and opacity are its virtues as employed in religious\r\n      art; whereas I hesitate not to affirm that in such art, more\r\n      than in any other, clearness, luminousness, and intensity of\r\n      hue are essential to right impression\" (_Modern Painters_, vol.\r\n      ii. pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. v. § 15). Ary Scheffer, whose father\r\n      was court painter at Amsterdam, was born at Dordrecht. On the\r\n      death of his father in 1809 his mother removed to Paris, and\r\n      he became a pupil of Pierre Guérin. In 1826 he became drawing\r\n      master in the Orleans family, and for the rest of his life\r\n      he was attached to them. In 1830, in company with Thiers, he\r\n      brought Louis Philippe, Duke of Orleans, to Paris; in 1848 he\r\n      helped the king to fly, and went with him to Brussels. The\r\n      events of the next few years shocked him so much that for a\r\n      time he \"could neither paint, eat, nor sleep,\" and he ceased\r\n      altogether to exhibit. His best known works are \"Paolo and\r\n      Francesca\" (1822), and \"Dante and Beatrice\" (1839). The former\r\n      of these sold in 1842 for over £2000; but at the posthumous\r\n      exhibition of his works, held shortly after his death, his\r\n      reputation suffered greatly, and at subsequent sales the\r\n      prices paid for his pictures went down with a rush. Their\r\n      sentimentality made them popular for a while, but it could not\r\n      save them from the condemnation due to their commonness of\r\n      thought and poverty of colour.\r\n\r\nA portrait of the lady--an English resident in Paris, and a friend of\r\nAry Scheffer--who sat to him for St. Monica.

MONICA.\r\n\r\n  _Ary Scheffer_ (French-Dutch: 1795-1858).\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the popularity which Ary Scheffer enjoyed forty years\r\nago, it may be interesting to cite what Mrs. Jameson said of this\r\npicture: \"I saw in the atelier of the painter, Ary Scheffer, in 1845,\r\nan admirable picture of St. Augustine and his mother Monica. The two\r\nfigures, not quite full-length, are seated; she holds his hand in\r\nboth hers, looking up to heaven with an expression of enthusiastic\r\nundoubting faith;--'the son of so many tears cannot be cast away!'\r\nHe also is looking up with an ardent, eager, but anxious, doubtful\r\nexpression, which seems to say, 'Help thou my unbelief.' For profound\r\nand truthful feeling and significance, I know few things in the compass\r\nof modern art that can be compared to this picture\" (_Sacred and\r\nLegendary Art_, 1850, p. 186).\r\n\r\n\r\n1171. THE \"ANSIDEI MADONNA.\"\r\n\r\n  _Raphael_ (Urbino: 1483-1520).\r\n\r\n      The genius of Raphael Santi (or Raffaello Sanzio, as the\r\n      modern Italians write his name) is an example of the force\r\n      alike of hereditary transmission of gifts and of surrounding\r\n      circumstances. He was the second son (born April 6) of\r\n      Giovanni Santi (see 751), a painter and poet of Urbino. The\r\n      son inherited the father's aptitude for painting; but as\r\n      Giovanni died when Raphael was only eleven, the boy's actual\r\n      teacher was Timoteo Viti, of whom there is a portrait in\r\n      chalks by Raphael in the British Museum. The young Raphael's\r\n      hereditary gifts were nurtured by the artistic atmosphere in\r\n      which he lived. Urbino, the Athens of Umbria, was at this\r\n      time one of the chief centres of artistic and intellectual\r\n      life in Italy; the ducal palace contained a fine collection\r\n      of pictures both by Italian and Flemish painters. Amongst\r\n      the latter were some by Van Eyck, and it is perhaps to this\r\n      influence that we may attribute the miniature-like care of\r\n      Raphael's earliest work, which is conspicuous in the \"Vision of\r\n      a Knight,\" and may be seen again in the jewel painting here.\r\n      An intense power of assimilation--of learning all things from\r\n      all men--characterised Raphael throughout his life, and is one\r\n      of the main causes of the width of range and catholicity of\r\n      taste to which he owes his universal popularity. Thus when he\r\n      went (probably not before 1500) to study under Perugino, he\r\n      so quickly assimilated the style of that master that he has\r\n      been credited with some of the design and even of the work in\r\n      Perugino's masterpiece, just as some of his pictures were, says\r\n      Vasari, mistaken for Perugino's. In 1504 he went to Florence,\r\n      which was his headquarters for the next four years. He at\r\n      once took a leading part in the artistic fraternity there,\r\n      and put one great artist after another under contribution for\r\n      some special power of drawing, beauty of colour, or grace of\r\n      composition. Thus from Signorelli and Michelangelo he learnt\r\n      to study the human form; it was at Florence, says Vasari, that\r\n      Raphael began to study the nude and to make anatomical drawings\r\n      from dissected corpses. From Leonardo da Vinci (sketches from\r\n      whom by Raphael may be seen at Oxford) he learnt soft beauty\r\n      of expression, and it is to this master's influence perhaps\r\n      that the smile of his Madonnas may be traced. In 1508 Raphael\r\n      was invited by the Pope Julius II. to Rome, and there he spent\r\n      the greater part of his life--painting, besides innumerable\r\n      altar-pieces and cabinet pictures, his famous cartoons and\r\n      frescoes. And yet he was only thirty-seven when he died.\r\n      His time was partly occupied too with portraiture, in which\r\n      he excelled. In 1514 he accepted the responsible office of\r\n      architect of St. Peter's, left vacant by the death of his\r\n      friend Bramante. A year later he was installed as director of\r\n      the excavations then in progress among the ruins of ancient\r\n      Rome, and flung himself into the work with devoted ardour. In\r\n      the heavy and multifarious work thus crowded upon him, Raphael\r\n      employed many assistants, among whom were Giulio Romano,\r\n      Giovanni da Udine, and Perino del Vaga, and in some of the\r\n      pictures of his Roman period the master's own hand executed\r\n      little more than the finishing touches. All that we know of\r\n      Raphael's private life and character reflects that innate love\r\n      of beauty which fused all he borrowed into something of his\r\n      own. \"All were surpassed by him,\" says Vasari, \"in friendly\r\n      courtesy as well as in art; all confessed the influence of\r\n      his sweet and gracious disposition, which was so replete with\r\n      excellence and so perfect in all the charities, that not only\r\n      was he honoured by men but even by the very animals, who would\r\n      constantly follow his steps and always loved him.\" In morals he\r\n      was pure, and might indeed be called almost immaculate, judged\r\n      by the lax standard of his age. The Cardinal Bibiena designed\r\n      his niece for Raphael, but--\r\n\r\n    Rafael made a century of sonnets,\r\n    Made and wrote them in a certain volume\r\n    Dinted with the silver-pointed pencil\r\n    Else he only used to draw Madonnas:\r\n    These, the world might view--but one, the volume.\r\n    Who that one, you ask? Your heart instructs you.\r\n\r\n      He lived a painter among princes--\"a model,\" says Vasari,\r\n      \"of how we should comport ourselves towards great men,\" but\r\n      also a prince among painters--jealous of none, kindly to\r\n      all. \"Whenever any other painter, whether known to him or\r\n      not, requested any assistance, he would invariably leave his\r\n      work to do him service; and his school--consisting of some\r\n      fifty painters, all men of ability and distinction--continued\r\n      in such unity and concord that all harsh feelings and evil\r\n      dispositions became subdued and disappeared at the sight of\r\n      him.\" And so when he died--having impaired his constitution by\r\n      a life of ceaseless toil--Rome went into a paroxysm of grief,\r\n      and flocked, as he lay in state, to catch a last sight of the\r\n      \"divine painter.\" He died on his birthday, April 6, and was\r\n      buried in the Pantheon with great solemnities.\r\n\r\n      With regard to Raphael's position in the history of art, it\r\n      is important to distinguish between his different \"periods,\"\r\n      which correspond, as will be seen, with the divisions of his\r\n      life. The National Gallery is fortunate in having specimens of\r\n      all the periods, and the importance of the pictures from this\r\n      point of view is noted under the several numbers, but it may\r\n      be convenient to summarise the matter briefly here. (1) First,\r\n      or Perugian period, down to 1504--which again may perhaps be\r\n      subdivided as explained under 213. During this period his works\r\n      closely resemble Perugino's--the most typical of them are the\r\n      \"Sposalizio,\" at Milan, copied from Perugino's painting of\r\n      the same subject, now at Caen; and the \"Crucifixion,\" in Mr.\r\n      L. Mond's Collection, of which Vasari says: \"If it were not\r\n      for the name of Raphael written upon it, it would be supposed\r\n      by every one to be a work of Pietro Perugino.\" (2) Second,\r\n      or Florentine period: 1504-1508. To this period belong the\r\n      \"Madonna del Granduca\" at Florence, \"La Belle Jardinière\" at\r\n      the Louvre, and in this country the Madonna at Lord Cowper's\r\n      (Panshanger), the Bridgewater Madonna (929), the St. Catherine\r\n      (168), and this \"Ansidei Madonna.\" The importance of this\r\n      picture in the history of art is that it shows the transition\r\n      from the first to the second period, being dated (on the border\r\n      of the Virgin's robe below her left arm) MDVI, 1506. A glance\r\n      at the Perugino No. 288 will show how much of that master's\r\n      influence remains. \"To his earlier Perugian manner we ascribe,\"\r\n      says Waagen (_Treasures of Art in Great Britain_, iii. 128),\r\n      \"the head of the Virgin, which, however, is the most beautiful\r\n      and noble development of this whole style, the rather too\r\n      round body of the otherwise very lovely child, the expression\r\n      of ardent yearning in St. John, as well as the position of\r\n      his feet, resembling that of St. Joseph in the 'Sposalizio,'\r\n      the cast of the draperies of the Virgin and St. Nicholas, the\r\n      use of several colours which have turned very dark, such as\r\n      the blue in the robe of the Virgin, the green in the canopy,\r\n      in the upper garment of St. Nicholas, and in the landscape,\r\n      and the use of gold in the hems, in the glories, in the two\r\n      Greek borders, and in the inscription SALVE MATER CHRISTI on\r\n      the wooden throne.\" Another point of special value in this\r\n      picture is that, like the Sistine Madonna, it is entirely by\r\n      Raphael's own hand, no pupil or assistant having touched it.\r\n      (3) Third, or Roman period, 1508-1520. The chief works of this\r\n      period are the frescoes in the Vatican. But in this country\r\n      there are the famous cartoons (at South Kensington), and in\r\n      the National Gallery the portrait of Julius II. (27), and the\r\n      Garvagh Madonna (744). The characteristics of this period are,\r\n      besides the perfection of executive power, the substitution\r\n      of classical for religious motive, and the straining after\r\n      dramatic effect.\r\n\r\n      From the technical point of view, this division into three (or\r\n      four) periods is instructive, but from the point of view of\r\n      motive a better division is that between his earlier and his\r\n      later work, the turning-point being his arrival in Rome. \"In\r\n      his twenty-fifth year,\" says Ruskin (Edinburgh _Lectures on\r\n      Architecture and Painting_, p. 213), \"one half-year only past\r\n      the precise centre of his available life, he was sent for to\r\n      Rome, to decorate the Vatican for Pope Julius II., and having\r\n      until that time worked exclusively in the ancient and stern\r\n      mediæval manner, he, in the first chamber which he decorated\r\n      in that palace, wrote upon its walls the _Mene_, _Tekel_,\r\n      _Upharsin_ of the arts of Christianity. And he wrote it thus:\r\n      On one wall of that chamber he placed a picture of the World\r\n      or Kingdom of _Theology_, presided over by _Christ_. And on\r\n      the side wall of that same chamber he placed the World or\r\n      Kingdom of _Poetry_, presided over by _Apollo_. And from that\r\n      spot, and from that hour, the intellect and the art of Italy\r\n      date their degradation.... And it was brought about in great\r\n      part by the very excellences of the man who had thus marked\r\n      the commencement of decline. The perfection of execution and\r\n      the beauty of feature which were attained in his works, and\r\n      in those of his greatest contemporaries, rendered finish of\r\n      execution and beauty of form the chief objects of all artists;\r\n      and thenceforward execution was looked for rather than thought,\r\n      and beauty rather than veracity.... The mediæval principles\r\n      led _up_ to Raphael, and the modern principles lead _down_\r\n      from him.\" The position of Raphael in the history of art\r\n      is thus closely parallel to that of his great contemporary\r\n      Michael Angelo (see 790). In Michael Angelo the art of Florence\r\n      reached its culmination and fell rapidly to Giulio Romano and\r\n      Venusti. In Raphael the art of Umbria was perfected and led\r\n      down to the conventional sentimentalities against which the\r\n      \"Pre-Raphaelites\" have in modern times revolted.\r\n\r\nThe \"Ansidei Madonna,\" so called from having been painted for the\r\nAnsidei family at Perugia,[230] was bought from the Duke of Marlborough\r\nby the nation for £70,000--more than three times the highest price ever\r\nbefore paid for a picture, and equal to more than £14 per square inch.\r\nThe importance of the picture to the student has been partly described\r\nabove; but to this must be added its unusual size and excellent state\r\nof preservation, and the fact that whilst on the one hand the National\r\nGallery had before no _chef d'oeuvre_ of Raphael, the number of such\r\nworks not already placed in foreign galleries was very small.[231]\r\nOn its own merits the \"Ansidei Madonna\" is by common consent one of\r\nthe most perfect pictures in the world. It has all the essentials of\r\nthe greatest art. First it is \"wrought in entirely consistent and\r\npermanent materials. The gold is represented by painting, not laid\r\non with real gold, and the painting is so secure that nearly four\r\nhundred years have produced in it no harmful change.\" \"The exquisite\r\npurity of the colour and the silvery and luminous quality of its\r\ntones\"[232] are as remarkable to-day as they must have been when the\r\npanel left the painter's easel. Secondly, \"the figures are in perfect\r\npeace. Those are the two first attributes of the best art. Faultless\r\nworkmanship and perfect serenity; a continuous, not momentary,\r\naction, or entire inaction; you are to be interested, in the living\r\ncreatures, not in what is happening to them. Then the third attribute\r\nof the best art is that it compels you to think of the spirit of the\r\ncreature, and therefore of its face, more than of its body. And the\r\nfourth is that in the face you shall be led to see only beauty or\r\njoy--never vileness, vice, or pain\" (_Relation between Michael Angelo\r\nand Tintoret_, pp. 14, 15). In fulfilling these essentials of the\r\nhighest art, the picture becomes also one of the noblest embodiments\r\nof Christianity. Raphael is above all the painter of motherhood and\r\nchildhood--of the self-forgetting love of the one, and the fearless\r\nfaith of the other--the human relationship which of all others is the\r\nmost divine. On either side are two saints--types both of them of\r\nthe peace of Christianity. In the figure of St. John the Baptist on\r\nthe left--with his rough camel skin upon him, and an expression of\r\necstatic contemplation on his face--the joy that comes from a life of\r\nself-sacrifice is made manifest; in that of the good Bishop Nicholas\r\nof Bari, the peace that comes from knowledge. The three balls at his\r\nfeet are a favourite emblem of the saint; typical partly of the mystery\r\nof the Trinity, but referring also to the three purses of gold which\r\nhe is said to have thrown into a poor man's window that his daughters\r\nmight not be portionless. Further we may notice how the same impression\r\nof infinite peace is conveyed by the landscape, and especially by the\r\nopen sky visible on either side of the throne. This open sky \"is of\r\nall visible things the least material, the least finite, the farthest\r\nwithdrawn from the earth prison-house, the most typical of the nature\r\nof God, the most suggestive of the glory of His dwelling-place. For\r\nthe sky of night, though we may know it boundless, is dark; it is a\r\nstudded vault, a roof that seems to shut us in and down; but the bright\r\ndistance has no limit: we feel its infinity, as we rejoice in its\r\npurity of light\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. v.\r\n§ 5).[233]\r\n\r\nIt has been said above that the Ansidei Madonna is \"by common consent\r\none of the most perfect pictures in the world.\" Criticisms which\r\nhave been published since its acquisition by the National Gallery\r\nrequire that statement to be modified. Thus, Mr. G. A. Storey, R.A.,\r\nin the course of a public lecture, has remarked that \"as compared\r\nwith Raphael's other works, the Ansidei Madonna lacked the touch of\r\nnature, the play and harmony that were characteristic of the master.\r\nAll the heads were looking in the same direction, and the figure of the\r\nVirgin was scarcely graceful. Nor was there the unity necessary to a\r\ncomplete composition, for each figure seemed unconnected with the rest,\r\nand, indeed, they seemed to be almost unconscious of each other's\r\nexistence.\" Mr. Ford Madox Brown (_Magazine of Art_, Feb. 1890) is more\r\nsevere still. \"The Bishop saint of Bari,\" he says, \"is certainly a fine\r\nfigure, worthy of the master it is attributed to. The Virgin and Child,\r\nhowever, are for sentiment just like two wax doll lay figures, making\r\nit hard to conceive how the same mighty hand can have produced anything\r\nso tame; while the figure of the Baptist, with ill-drawn legs, is\r\npositively repulsive both for pose and for expression of countenance.\r\nSurely Raphael could have had no hand in it.\" Mr. Pater, on the other\r\nhand, commends the Ansidei Madonna to students of Raphael as more\r\nworthy of admiration than any other work of the master: \"I find there,\r\nat first sight, with something of the pleasure one has in a proposition\r\nof Euclid, a sense of the power of the understanding, in the economy\r\nwith which he has reduced his material to the simplest terms. He is\r\npainting in Florence, but for Perugia, and sends it a specimen of its\r\nown old art--Mary and the babe enthroned, with St. Nicholas and the\r\nBaptist in attendance on either side. The kind of thing people there\r\nhad already seen so many times, but done better, in a sense not to\r\nbe measured by degrees, with a wholly original freedom and life and\r\ngrace, though he perhaps is unaware, done better as a whole, because\r\nbetter in every minute particular, than ever before. The scrupulous\r\nscholar, aged twenty-three, is now indeed a master, but still goes\r\ncarefully. Note, therefore, how much mere exclusion counts for in the\r\npositive effect of his work. There is a saying that the true artist is\r\nknown best by what he omits. Yes, because the whole question of good\r\ntaste is involved precisely in such jealous omission. Note this, for\r\ninstance, in the familiar Apennine background, with its blue hills\r\nand brown towns, faultless, for once--for once only--and observe, in\r\nthe Umbrian pictures around, how often such background is marred by\r\ngrotesque natural, or architectural detail, by incongruous or childish\r\nincident. In this cool, pearl-gray, quiet place, where colour tells for\r\ndouble,--the jewelled cope, the painted book in the hand of Mary, the\r\nchaplet of red coral,--one is reminded that among all classical writers\r\nRaphael's preference was for the faultless Virgil. How orderly, how\r\ndivinely clean and sweet the flesh, the vesture, the floor, the earth\r\nand sky! Ah, say rather the hand, the method of the painter! There is\r\nan unmistakable pledge of strength, of movement and animation in the\r\ncast of the Baptist's countenance, but reserved, repressed. Strange,\r\nRaphael has given him a staff of transparent crystal. Keep, then, to\r\nthat picture as the embodied formula of Raphael's genius. Amid all he\r\nhas here already achieved, full, we may think, of the quiet assurance\r\nof what is to come, his attitude is still that of the scholar; he\r\nseems still to be saying, before all things, from first to last, 'I am\r\nutterly purposed that I will not offend'\" (_Miscellaneous Studies_, p.\r\n53).\r\n\r\n\r\n1172. CHARLES THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See 49._\r\n\r\nThis famous picture was one of many equestrian portraits of Charles\r\nI. which Van Dyck painted at his court. It is, however, unique among\r\nthem. In all the others,--the Windsor picture, the replica at Hampton\r\nCourt, and the pictures in the Earl of Warwick's and the Marquis of\r\nLothian's Collections, the king faces the spectator, and rides, as it\r\nwere, straight out of the picture, the horse being white. The size,\r\nproportions, and composition of this picture are different. The horse\r\nis dun-coloured, and the king is seen in profile. A small picture at\r\nBuckingham Palace was probably the original design or sketch of it. It\r\nwas sold after Charles's death for £150 by the Parliament, and in 1885\r\nwas bought by another Parliament--from the Duke of Marlborough--for the\r\ngreat price of £17,500 (_see_ under 1171).\r\n\r\nIt is a courtier's portrait of the idol of the cavaliers--a portrait of\r\nthe good side of a bad king. Notice first the prominence given to the\r\nnoble horse (_cf._ under 156), almost to the point of clumsiness. Then\r\nin Charles himself, note the stately bearing, the personal dignity, the\r\nalmost feminine refinement. It is a portrait of personal courage--with\r\nno suspicion of any fatal want of presence of mind; of dignity--with\r\nthe obstinacy, which was its reverse side, left out. In such a portrait\r\n\"of a Cavalier by a Cavalier\" Van Dyck's work is invested with an\r\nenduring pathos for all Englishmen. One remembers only, in looking upon\r\nthis picture of him, Charles's graces, not his faults. One thinks of\r\nhim as the man who \"nothing common did, nor mean, upon that memorable\r\nscene.\" And so considered, how eloquent becomes the isolation in which\r\nthe painter has here left him. With him, indeed, is Sir Thomas Morton,\r\nhis equerry, but the king does not see him. Bareheaded he sits, gazing\r\ninto futurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n1173. AN UNKNOWN SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n  _School of Giorgione_ (Venetian: 16th Century). _See 269._\r\n\r\nAnother picture of the golden age (_cf._ 1123) such as Giorgione,\r\nwe are told, loved to paint,--\"men and women enjoying the golden\r\ntranquillity; here is seen the haughty lion, there the humble lamb;\r\nin another part we behold the swift flying hart, with many other\r\nterrestrial animals.\" The picture before us precisely agrees with this\r\ngeneral description, but the particular subject of it is unknown.[234]\r\nA child, it would seem, is being initiated into some order of the\r\ngolden age--he is being dedicated, perhaps, to a life of song, for the\r\nstately personage on the throne wears the poet's crown of wild olive,\r\nwhilst the young man on the steps below him lightly touches a lute,\r\nand has books by his side. The page bears a rich dish of fruits and\r\nherbs, for the golden age is vegetarian; whilst fawns and a leopard,\r\nwith a peacock and other birds, attend the court of the king of song.\r\nWhen in the Bohn Collection, this picture was ascribed to Giorgione.\r\nFor some interesting remarks on its possible authorship and subject,\r\nsee the _Times_, December 22, 1885, where resemblances in this picture\r\nto pictures of Carpaccio and Pordenone, as well as of Giorgione,\r\nare pointed out. Sir Edward Poynter says that the picture \"has\r\nconsiderable affinity with the two pictures attributed to Giorgione\r\nin the Uffizzi Gallery at Florence, but is weaker in execution and\r\neffect, especially in the landscape\" (_The National Gallery_, i. 26).\r\n\"True,\" says Mr. Herbert Cook, \"the landscape has been renovated;\r\ntrue, the Giorgionesque depth and richness is gone, the mellow glow\r\nof the 'Epiphany' (1160) is sadly wanting; but who can deny the charm\r\nof the picturesque scenery, which vividly recalls the landscape\r\nbackground elsewhere in the master's own work? who can fail to admire\r\nthe natural and unstudied grouping of the figures, the artlessness of\r\nthe whole, the loving simplicity with which the painter has done his\r\nwork? Sincerity and naïveté are too apparent for this to be the work\r\nof any but a quite young artist, and one whose style is so thoroughly\r\n'Giorgionesque' as to be none other than the young Giorgione himself.\r\nIn my opinion, this is one of his earliest essays into the region of\r\nromance, painted probably before his twenty-first year\" (_Giorgione_,\r\np. 92).\r\n\r\n\r\n1188. THE BETRAYAL OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n\r\n1189. THE PROCESSION TO CALVARY.\r\n\r\n  _Ugolino_ (Sienese: died 1339).\r\n\r\n      Ugolino was one of the founders of the Sienese School. So\r\n      great was his reputation that he was unanimously chosen by\r\n      the Florentines, in preference to their own artists, to paint\r\n      the altar-pieces of their two great churches; whilst another\r\n      picture that he painted for them was credited with miraculous\r\n      powers. These little pictures are portions of the one painted\r\n      by him for the high altar of Sta. Croce. \"He always adhered,\"\r\n      says Vasari (i. 138), \"in great part to the Greek manner, as\r\n      one who, having grown old in that method, was induced by a\r\n      sort of obstinacy to follow the manner of Cimabue, rather than\r\n      that of Giotto.\" The points which have been already noticed as\r\n      characteristic of his contemporary, Duccio (see 566), may be\r\n      traced equally in Ugolino.\r\n\r\nNotice in 1188 that the disciples are not mere conventional types,\r\nbut that an attempt is made to give them each an individuality, and\r\nto express their characters on their faces. The same expressions may\r\nbe noticed again in 1189. It is interesting, too, to observe how the\r\nfirst attempts of painting (as of poetry) to express action were epic,\r\nrather than dramatic. The painter tries to tell the whole story at\r\nonce; here is Judas giving the traitor's kiss, there is Peter cutting\r\noff the ear of the high priest's servant, and beside them are all the\r\nother characters of the story (_cf._ under 579). As art advances,\r\nit becomes on the other hand dramatic; the painter seizes on the\r\nessential point and makes his picture out of that. The difference may\r\nbe seen by contrasting Ugolino's picture with one of the same subject\r\nat Florence by Giotto, which Ruskin thus describes: \"See what choice\r\nGiotto made of his moments. Plenty of choice for him--in pain. The\r\nFlagellation--the Mocking--the Bearing the Cross; all habitually given\r\nby the Margheritones, and their school, as extremes of pain. 'No,'\r\nthinks Giotto. 'There was worse than all that. Many a good man has been\r\nmocked, spitefully entreated, spitted on, slain. But who was ever so\r\nbetrayed?' ... He paints the laying hands on him in the garden, but\r\nwith only two principal figures--Judas and Peter, of course: Judas and\r\nPeter were always principal in the old Byzantine composition,--Judas\r\ngiving the kiss, Peter cutting off the servant's ear. But the two\r\nare here not merely principal, but almost alone in sight, all the\r\nother figures thrown back; and Peter is not at all concerned about\r\nthe servant, or his struggle with him. He has got him down, but looks\r\nback suddenly at Judas giving the kiss. 'What!--_you_ are the traitor,\r\nthen--you!' 'Yes,' says Giotto; 'and you, also, in an hour more'\"\r\n(_Mornings in Florence_, ii. 41).\r\n\r\n\r\n1190. A BOY'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Clouet_ (French: about 1510-1572). _See 660._\r\n\r\nThis picture was presented to the Gallery by Mr. G. F. Watts, R.A., and\r\nit is interesting to note the sage-green background which Mr. Watts has\r\nhimself sometimes employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1192, 1193. SKETCHES FOR ALTAR-PIECES\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Battista Tiepolo_ (Venetian: 1692-1769).\r\n\r\n      Tiepolo, one of the leaders in the revival of Venetian art (see\r\n      under 1100), was the Paul Veronese of the eighteenth century.\r\n      \"Living,\" says Sir F. Burton, \"in the era of periwig in art\r\n      as a dress, he was at a sore disadvantage as compared with\r\n      his great prototype of the sixteenth century; but he steered\r\n      a pretty clear course between vapid classicality and buckram\r\n      fashion. Gifted with a brilliant fancy, and master of all the\r\n      resources of his art, Tiepolo formed a style which, whatever\r\n      its shortcomings, is splendidly decorative. In his easel\r\n      pictures, he is at his very best. Here he was not tempted by\r\n      vast surfaces into that looseness of composition and hastiness\r\n      of execution that often lessen the value of his frescoes;\r\n      here, therefore, he could indulge his feeling for compact\r\n      architectonic arrangement, display force of harmonious colour,\r\n      and exercise a brilliant method of handling akin to that of\r\n      Paul Veronese.\" Tiepolo worked for most of his life at Venice;\r\n      but went also to execute commissions at Milan, Wurzburg (where\r\n      his paintings in the Archbishop's Palace may still be seen),\r\n      and Madrid, in which latter city he died. Of his frescoes at\r\n      Venice the finest are those of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" in the\r\n      Palazzo Labia. Copies of these are in the Arundel Society's\r\n      Collection.\r\n\r\n\"Touched in with all the brilliant, flashing, dexterous _bravura_ of\r\nthe last of the rear-guard of the Venetians. The pictorial art of\r\nVenice finished with Tiepolo, and it seemed as if he was resolved that\r\nit should not die ignominiously, for in spirit and gaiety he was little\r\ninferior to Veronese himself. He had not the stronger qualities of his\r\nmodel; Veronese's grasp of character, his air of nobility, his profound\r\nand imaginative harmonies of colour, are wanting in the eighteenth\r\ncentury painter\" (_Times_, December 22, 1885).\r\n\r\n\r\n1194. CHRIST DRIVING OUT THE TRADERS.\r\n\r\n  _Marcello Venusti_ (Florentine: 1515-1579).\r\n\r\n      Venusti, a native of Como, was a pupil of Perino del Vaga,\r\n      but best known as assistant to Michelangelo, of whose works\r\n      he supplied copies with variations to suit different patrons.\r\n      In the oil copy of \"The Last Judgment,\" now at Naples, he\r\n      introduced in the left-hand corner a portrait of the master\r\n      himself. He was also employed to put into colour designs made\r\n      by Michelangelo.\r\n\r\nThere are drawings by Michelangelo in the British Museum for the\r\nfigures in this composition. Notice how everything is sacrificed to\r\nviolent action and contorted position--the money-changers whom Christ\r\nis driving out of the Temple are composed as it were for a ballet of\r\nlimbs. Notice also the \"debased\" architectural background--the absurdly\r\ndistorted pillars with their puerile capitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n1195. THE BIRTH OF VENUS.\r\n\r\n  _Rubens_ (Flemish: 1577-1640). _See 38._\r\n\r\nA finished study for a salver which was executed in silver for Charles\r\nI.\r\n\r\n      \"The central oval shows a goddess borne along and attended on\r\n      the surface of the waves by nymphs and tritons; sea gods and\r\n      goddesses, riding on aquatic monsters, disport themselves in\r\n      the broad flat border surrounding the central panel. Rubens may\r\n      be said to have here surpassed himself in those qualities of\r\n      movement and brilliant execution in which he was unrivalled.\r\n      His form, often florid in contour, although always supple, has\r\n      here a grace and beauty entirely in harmony with the classic\r\n      theme, and the personages are inspired with that immortal\r\n      gaiety which has so rarely found expression, save in the work\r\n      of the master's contemporary, our national poet, since it\r\n      vanished at the final decay of Greek art and literature. Of a\r\n      piece with the delightful imaginative qualities so prodigally\r\n      lavished on the present panel is the truly marvellous\r\n      execution. The hand has played over the surface with a\r\n      lightness and delicacy surprising even to those familiar with\r\n      the touch of the master in his first sketches for important\r\n      compositions. The method employed is simple and direct; the\r\n      figures have been outlined in pen and ink, then a general glaze\r\n      has been spread over the entire surface, on which the forms\r\n      were modelled in white and gray, the ultimate result being a\r\n      warm silvery tone\" (_Times_, December 22, 1885).\r\n\r\nThis design, which was sold at the Hamilton sale (1882) for £1680, was\r\nbought for the nation three years later at the Beckett Denison sale for\r\n£672.\r\n\r\n\r\n1196. A COMBAT BETWEEN LOVE AND CHASTITY.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Florentine School; 15th Century).\r\n\r\n      Probably by some unknown disciple of Botticelli. Formerly\r\n      ascribed to Botticelli himself--an ascription which, owing to\r\n      the absence of that master's predominating facial type, as well\r\n      as to the accuracy of landscape such as he never attempted,\r\n      has now been abandoned. But the exquisite workmanship--visible\r\n      only in a good light--of the shield and the quiver indicates\r\n      the hand of one of the goldsmith painters, whilst the\r\n      allegorical invention and the atmosphere of imaginative poetry\r\n      have \"the true Botticellian ring\" (see _Times_, December 22,\r\n      1885; see also Morelli's _Borghese Gallery_, p. 87 _n._). The\r\n      picture is one of a series which were probably painted for\r\n      furniture-panels. The one giving the sequel to our story, and\r\n      representing Chastity on a triumphal car, with Love sitting\r\n      bound in front, is in the Turin Gallery.\r\n\r\nChastity clothed only in white innocence is assailed by Love. She\r\nreceives his arrows on a shield of polished steel; the points of the\r\narrows break and burst forth into tiny golden flames--each temptation\r\nonly causing the sacred fire of Chastity to burn more brightly. The\r\nscene is laid in a romantic landscape where everything is pure and\r\nbeautiful. The field is enamelled with flowers--\r\n\r\n    Where the virgins are soft as the roses they twine;\r\n    And all, save the spirit of man, is divine.\r\n\r\nBeyond, in the bend of a river, two swans float on its tranquil\r\nsurface: a tall oak sapling rises straight and firm, and over all rests\r\na clear blue sky. The picture recalls the scene in Milton's _Comus_--\r\n\r\n    My sister is not so defenceless left\r\n    As you may imagine; she has a hidden strength,\r\n    Which you remember not.\r\n\r\n    _Second Brother._ What hidden strength,\r\n    Unless the strength of Heaven, if you mean that?\r\n\r\n    _First Brother._ I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength\r\n    Which, if Heaven gave it, may be term'd her own.\r\n    'Tis Chastity, my brother, Chastity;\r\n    She that has that, is clad in complete steel.\r\n\r\n\r\n1199. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Florentine: 15th Century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\nOn the right is St. John; on the left an angel crowned with a chaplet\r\nof roses and bearing the annunciation lily. Notice that the frame\r\nornamented with modelled stucco forms part of the picture, and is\r\nindeed part of the same panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n1200, 1201. GROUPS OF SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Macrino d'Alba_ (Lombard: about 1470-1528).\r\n\r\n      Macrino was born at Alba in Piedmont. \"There is no foundation\r\n      for the belief that his name was Giangiacomo Fava. His early\r\n      Lombard training was considerably modified by a visit to\r\n      Rome, and a study of the Florentine masters and Ghirlandajo's\r\n      influence is to be seen in his work. His pictures are easily\r\n      recognisable from the frequent recurrence of similar types\r\n      and attitudes\" (Catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club's\r\n      Exhibition, 1898, p. lxxvii.). The dates on his works range\r\n      from 1496 to 1508. They are to be found in the Certosa of\r\n      Pavia, at Alba, and in the Turin Gallery. He belongs to the\r\n      pre-Leonardo school of Lombardy, and was perhaps a pupil of\r\n      Vincenzo Foppa (729).\r\n\r\nIn the first group (1200) are St. Peter Martyr (for whom see 812),\r\nwith the knife and plenty of blood on his head, and a bishop in full\r\nrobes. In the second (1201), St. Thomas Aquinas looking with an almost\r\ncomic squint at a crucifix, and John the Baptist. On the pages of St.\r\nThomas's book are the words in Latin, \"I have kept the commandments of\r\nmy father\"; on those of St John the Baptist, \"Behold the Lamb of God,\r\nthat taketh away the sin of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1202. MADONNA AND CHILD, WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Bonifazio, the elder_ (Veronese: about 1490-1540).\r\n\r\n      Morelli disentangles from the confusions of art-historians and\r\n      critics three different painters of this name, whom he calls\r\n      respectively Bonifazio Veronese I., Bonifazio Veronese II., and\r\n      Bonifazio Veneziano (see _German Galleries_, pp. 184-194). The\r\n      elder Bonifazio Veronese, the painter of this picture, was a\r\n      pupil of Palma Vecchio, and one of the most brilliant of the\r\n      later Venetian painters. \"His bright conception,\" says Morelli,\r\n      \"and the light gracefulness of his figures seem to me never\r\n      to belie his native home, Verona; yet, as a technician, he is\r\n      an out-and-out Venetian. While the chords of his colouring\r\n      are neither so delicate and startling as in Giorgione, nor so\r\n      profound and powerful as in Palma and Titian, nor so ingenious\r\n      as in Lotto, yet they wield a peculiar charm over the eye\r\n      of the spectator by their bright, cheerful, and harmonious\r\n      lustre.\" Bonifazio's earlier works have been frequently\r\n      ascribed to Palma. Such was the case with the present picture,\r\n      a work of gorgeous colour and in admirable preservation. In\r\n      his later works the influence of Giorgione makes itself felt.\r\n      A much-damaged picture by Bonifazio at Hampton Court, \"Diana\r\n      and Actæon,\" was long ascribed to Giorgione. Venice possesses\r\n      many works of this \"God-made painter,\" as Ruskin calls him.\r\n      None is finer than the \"Dives and Lazarus\" in the Accademia, a\r\n      picture of sumptuous colour and exquisitely poetical sentiment.\r\n      In the Brera at Milan is another splendid work by Bonifazio,\r\n      long attributed to Giorgione--the \"Finding of Moses,\" a subject\r\n      of which he was fond, and into which he introduced numerous\r\n      figures in the gorgeous Venetian costumes of his day.\r\n\r\nA composition belonging to a class which Palma Vecchio brought into\r\nfavour, and which the Italians call _Sante Conversazioni_--groups,\r\nin restful attitudes, framed in sunny landscapes, with blue mountain\r\ndistances. Bonifazio's landscape backgrounds are very fine, and he was\r\nfond, like Titian, of introducing into them the scenery of the Dolomite\r\nmountains. On the right is St. Catherine holding a fragment of her\r\nwheel, while the youthful St. John the Baptist, standing on another\r\nfragment, stoops to kiss the infant Christ's foot--an action symbolical\r\nof the kingship of the Saviour (\"Thou hast put all things under him\").\r\nOn the left is St. James--with his staff, borne always by him as the\r\nfirst of the apostles who departed to fulfil the Gospel mission, and\r\ndressed as a pilgrim--Campostella, where his body was reputed to be,\r\nbeing in the middle ages a favourite place of pilgrimage. Behind St.\r\nJames is St. Jerome. Notice the significance of the incident in the\r\nmiddle distance--a shepherd asleep, while a wolf is devouring a sheep\r\n(\"But the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the sheep\").\r\n\r\n\r\n1203. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Cariani_ (Bergamese: about 1480-1541).\r\n\r\n      Of Giovanni Busi, called Cariani, no personal details are\r\n      known. He was born near Bergamo, and many works by this fine\r\n      colourist are in the galleries of that town. Others may\r\n      be seen at the Brera in Milan. Cariani, who seems to have\r\n      resided at Venice, is supposed to have been a pupil of his\r\n      fellow-countryman, Palma Vecchio. Morelli thus distinguishes\r\n      Cariani's style from that of Bonifazio Veronese (see 1202),\r\n      who was also a pupil of Palma: \"The type of the Madonna in\r\n      Cariani is rustic, but more energetic and serious, less worldly\r\n      than in Bonifazio, whose holy virgins and female martyrs,\r\n      with their soft, sweet expression and gentle grace, often\r\n      border on the sentimental. These masters also differ in the\r\n      harmony of their colours: the Bergamese is pithy and powerful,\r\n      but often heavy and dull; the Veronese, clear, lovely, and\r\n      brilliant; Bonifazio's landscapes are the lightest among those\r\n      of the Venetians, those in Cariani's pictures are brownish,\r\n      and the lines far from beautiful\" (_Italian Masters in German\r\n      Galleries_, 1883, p. 193).\r\n\r\nNotice the rustic type of the Madonna; she is a daughter of the\r\nmountains--the mountains above Bergamo, from which the painter came,\r\nand which figure in the background. The picture is a characteristic\r\npiece of provincial art; the expression of \"a simple, sturdy, energetic\r\nmountain-folk who do not always know how to unite refinement and grace\r\nwith their inbred strength and vigour\" (Morelli, _ibid._ p. 4). The\r\npicture is \"interesting mainly,\" says Mr. Monkhouse, \"for its costumes,\r\nits light-heartedness and florid colour, and as another of those _Sante\r\nConversazioni_ of which his master, Palma, was the inventor, and\r\nwhich took the place of the more holy 'Holy Families' of an earlier\r\nart,--pictures in which the Virgin became a simple woman of a wholly\r\nmundane beauty, and the saints but her friends in rich costumes,\r\nenjoying themselves somewhat sadly in the open air\" (_In the National\r\nGallery_, p. 248).\r\n\r\n\r\n1206. LANDSCAPE AND FIGURES.\r\n\r\n  _Salvator Rosa_ (Neapolitan: 1615-1673). _See 84._\r\n\r\nA good example of Salvator's scenic effects in landscape. The sense of\r\npower in the painting, the \"vigorous imagination, the dexterous and\r\nclever composition\" of Salvator are well shown; but \"all are rendered\r\nvalueless by coarseness of feeling, and habitual non-reference to\r\nnature.\" (See for further examination of Salvator's deficiencies in\r\nthis respect _Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. § 5,\r\nsec. iii. ch. iii. § 7, sec. vi. ch. i. § 11; vol. ii. pt. iii. sec.\r\nii. ch. ii. § 19.)\r\n\r\n\r\n1211, 1212. SCENES AT A TOURNAMENT.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Morone_ (Veronese: 1442-1508?)\r\n\r\n      Domenico Morone was in 1493 called upon by the Veronese\r\n      authorities in conjunction with Liberale (1134) to adjudicate\r\n      upon an artistic dispute. It seems, therefore, that he was\r\n      recognised as a leading painter of the day. This also is\r\n      Vasari's estimate: Domenico, he says, was in higher repute than\r\n      any other painter of Verona, Liberale alone excepted. Little,\r\n      however, is known to us about Domenico. Only two pictures are\r\n      known to bear his signature; one of these, a \"Madonna and\r\n      Child,\" is in the Berlin Gallery. He was the father of the\r\n      better known Francesco Morone (285).\r\n\r\nPossibly scenes from the _fêtes_ at the marriage of Isabella d'Este\r\nand Francesco Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua.[235] Domenico Morone,\r\ncalled Pellacane, the dog-skinner, from his father's occupation, may\r\nhave been present at the marriage ceremony, which took place in 1490;\r\nbut at any rate these little pictures are of historical interest as\r\ncontemporary illustrations. The scene in both is a tilt court, with its\r\nseat of honour in the middle. In the first the knights are tilting, the\r\nmarquis being on his throne and the seats filled with ladies. In the\r\nsecond the tilting is over, courtiers and ladies are dancing in the\r\nside compartments; whilst in the centre a knight in full armour, but\r\nbareheaded, awaits his award of victory from Isabella and her husband,\r\nwho are standing on the dais. There is much artistic merit in the\r\nsprightly way in which such momentary actions as that of the page going\r\nto spring over the partition in 1212 are rendered (see _Times_, July\r\n24, 1886).\r\n\r\n\r\n1213. PORTRAIT OF A PROFESSOR.\r\n\r\n  _Gentile Bellini_ (Venetian: 1427-1507).\r\n\r\n      Gentile was the elder brother of Giovanni (189), and was named\r\n      after Gentile da Fabriano under whom his father had studied.\r\n      In 1464, after severe training in his father's school, he\r\n      moved from Padua to Venice, and was employed by the State.\r\n      His high reputation is shown by the fact that, when in 1479\r\n      the Sultan Mahomet II. applied to the Venetians to send him a\r\n      good painter, he was deputed by them to go to Constantinople.\r\n      His visit there was marked by a well-known incident. He showed\r\n      the Sultan a picture of Herodias's daughter with the head of\r\n      John the Baptist. The Sultan objected to the bleeding head\r\n      as untrue to nature, and to prove his point ordered a slave\r\n      to be beheaded in Bellini's presence. The painter fled from\r\n      the scene of such experiments, but the influence of his visit\r\n      is to be seen in the oriental costumes which he was fond of\r\n      introducing into his pictures (as in the studies in the British\r\n      Museum and the library of Windsor Castle). The portrait of\r\n      the great Ottoman conqueror acquired by the late Sir Henry\r\n      Layard is an autograph replica of the work painted by Gentile\r\n      at Constantinople. On his return to Venice he was taken into\r\n      the permanent employment of the State, and executed many works\r\n      in the Ducal Palace and elsewhere; some were destroyed in\r\n      the fire of 1577, others remain. In 1486 Titian, then a boy\r\n      of nine, entered Gentile's studio. Easel pictures by him are\r\n      very scarce. His principal works are at Venice, and are the\r\n      most valuable record extant of the city as it was in his time.\r\n      They are described and highly praised by Ruskin in his _Guide\r\n      to the Academy at Venice_. In the same style is the \"St. Mark\r\n      preaching at Alexandria,\" now in the Brera at Milan. This work,\r\n      left unfinished when Gentile died, was completed, as his will\r\n      enjoined, by Giovanni.\r\n\r\nSupposed to be a portrait of Girolamo Malatini, Professor of\r\nMathematics in Venice (notice his brass compasses), who is said to\r\nhave taught Gentile and his brother Giovanni the rules of perspective.\r\n\"The portrait fully justifies the fame that Gentile had acquired as a\r\npainter of portraits, and shows him the forerunner of Titian\" (Layard's\r\nedition of \"Kugler,\" i. 306). The prominence given in this picture to\r\nthe sitter's hands should be noticed. The older tradition strictly\r\nlimited portraiture to the representation of the head only, or at most\r\nto the bust. Afterwards the expressiveness of the human hand _per se_\r\ncame to be recognised (see Mr. Herbert Cook's _Giorgione_, p. 19, and\r\ncompare the portraits Nos. 808 and 1440).\r\n\r\n\r\n1214. CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, AND VETURIA.\r\n\r\n  _Michele da Verona_ (Veronese: 1470-1523?)\r\n\r\n      Michele, a pupil of Domenico Morone (1211), was a contemporary\r\n      and sometimes an assistant of Cavazzola (735). The works of\r\n      the two are easily distinguishable. Michele, says Morelli,\r\n      \"is more pointed in the foldings of his draperies, as well as\r\n      in the fingers of his hands, which are always rather stumpy\r\n      in Cavazzola. In conception, however, Cavazzola is far above\r\n      Michele, and also more elegant and noble in his drawing\"\r\n      (_German Galleries_, p. 54). Many of Michele's works are to be\r\n      seen at Verona. His landscape backgrounds, as in the present\r\n      picture, are interesting.\r\n\r\nCoriolanus, a noble Roman, so called from Corioli, a city of the\r\nVolscians he had taken, bore himself haughtily, and was banished.\r\nNursing his revenge, he threw himself into the arms of the Volscians,\r\ndetermined henceforth to bear himself \"As if a man were author of\r\nhimself, And knew no other kin,\" and advanced at their head upon Rome.\r\nThe Romans, in terror, endeavoured in vain to appease him, and at last\r\nsent out his wife, Volumnia, with her child, here kneeling before him,\r\nand his mother, Veturia (Volumnia in Shakespeare's play), to intercede.\r\nIn their presence \"the strong man gave way; he throws himself on his\r\nknee, and is restored once more to human love\"--\r\n\r\n            Like a dull actor now,\r\n    I have forgot my part ... O, a kiss\r\n    Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!\r\n    Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss\r\n    I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip\r\n    Hath virgin'd it e'er since. Ye gods! I prate,\r\n    And the most noble mother of the world\r\n    Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth.\r\n\r\n  SHAKESPEARE: _Coriolanus_, Act v. Sc. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n1215. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Veneziano_ (died 1461). _See 766._\r\n\r\nFor the history of this picture (now withdrawn from exhibition) see\r\nunder 766. The restorations of 1851 there referred to were in great\r\npart removed after the acquisition of the picture by the National\r\nGallery. But \"it was found, late in 1904, that its state threatened\r\nits immediate destruction, and it was hoped that the mischief might\r\nbe arrested by re-lining. The pigment was, however, found to be\r\nfalling from the plaster ground in such a way that re-lining, which\r\nwould affect only the adherence of the ground to the canvas backing,\r\nwas useless, and very reluctant recourse was had to the process of\r\ntransferring the picture itself to canvas. This transfer resulted in\r\nsuch a loss to the picture that it has been withdrawn from public\r\nexhibition, and, for the present, it is thought better to leave it as a\r\ngenuine picture, of interest to connoisseurs, rather than subject it to\r\nthe extensive repainting without which it would hardly be intelligible\r\nto the ordinary visitor\" (_Director's Report_, 1905). A small copy of\r\nthe picture is exhibited among the Arundel Society's Collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n1216, 1216 a & b. THE FALL OF THE REBEL ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Spinello Aretino_ (Tuscan: about 1333-1410). _See 581._\r\n\r\nThese fragments of a fresco, now transferred to canvas, are of\r\nparticular interest from the following mention of it by Vasari. He\r\nrelates how Spinello Aretino, after executing important works in\r\nvarious cities of Italy, returned to his native city, Arezzo, and very\r\nshortly settled down to decorate the church of S. Maria degli Angeli.\r\nThe subject chosen was certain stories from the life of St. Michael.\r\n\"At the high altar,\" says Vasari, \"he represented Lucifer fixing his\r\nseat in the North, with the fall of the angels, who are changed into\r\ndevils as they descend to the earth. In the air appears St. Michael\r\nin combat with the old serpent of seven heads and ten horns, while\r\nbeneath and in the centre of the picture is Lucifer, already changed\r\ninto a most hideous beast. And so anxious was the artist to make him\r\nfrightful and horrible that it is said--such is sometimes the power\r\nof imagination--that the figure he had painted appeared to him in his\r\nsleep, demanding to know where the painter had seen him looking so\r\nugly as that, and wherefore he permitted his pencils to offer him, the\r\nsaid Lucifer, so mortifying an affront.\" Vasari attributes a fatal\r\nresult to this vision. \"The artist awoke,\" he says, \"in such extremity\r\nof terror that he was unable to cry out, but shook and trembled so\r\nviolently that his wife, awakening, hastened to his assistance. But\r\nthe shock was so great that he was on the point of expiring suddenly\r\nfrom this accident, and did not in fact survive it beyond a very short\r\ntime, during which he remained in a dispirited condition, with eyes\r\nfrom which all intelligence had departed\" (i. 269). In fact, however,\r\nSpinello lived many years and executed several important works after\r\nthe date in question. Some years ago the church of the Angeli was\r\ndismantled, and the greater portion of the frescoes perished. Sir A.\r\nH. Layard, who was passing Arezzo at the time, was fortunately able\r\nto secure a large piece of the principal fresco. The fragment is from\r\nthe centre of the composition, and contains a portion of the figure of\r\nMichael and six of the angels following him. The archangel, with raised\r\nsword, is striking at the dragon; his attendants, armed with spears and\r\nswords, thrust down the demons. Besides these figures, Sir A. H. Layard\r\nwas able to save a portion of the decorated border of the fresco (1216\r\nA & B). These he presented to the nation in 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n1217. THE ISRAELITES GATHERING MANNA.\r\n\r\n  _Ercole Roberti de' Grandi_ (Ferrarese: 1450-1496).\r\n  _See 1127._\r\n\r\n\"The lithe and sinewy form in the nude figure of the young man, the\r\naccurate draughtsmanship, the firm modelling, the care and study\r\nbestowed even on the tiny figures in the background, the dramatic\r\nintention and impression of vitality, indicate a familiarity with the\r\nworks of Mantegna\" (_Times_, July 24, 1886). The artist exhibits, adds\r\nSir F. Burton, \"no less appreciation of natural grace in the female\r\nfigures than of dignity in the principal male personages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1218, 1219. JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Ubertini_ (Florentine: 1494-1557).\r\n\r\n      Francesco, the son of Ubertino, a goldsmith, called Il\r\n      Bacchiacca, studied first under Perugino, and afterwards with\r\n      Franciabigio and Andrea del Sarto. He was also at one time\r\n      in Rome, where he lived on terms of intimacy with Giulio\r\n      Romano and Benvenuto Cellini; he is mentioned in Cellini's\r\n      Autobiography. He was \"more particularly successful,\" says\r\n      Vasari, \"in the execution of small figures, which he executed\r\n      to perfection and with infinite patience. Ultimately Bacchiacca\r\n      was received into the service of the Duke Cosimo, seeing\r\n      that he was excellent in the delineation of all kinds of\r\n      animals, and was therefore employed to decorate a study for\r\n      his Excellency, which he did with great ability, covering the\r\n      same with birds of various kinds, together with rare plants\r\n      and foliage. At a later period he painted in fresco the grotto\r\n      of a fountain which is in the garden of the Pitti Palace, and\r\n      also prepared the designs for hangings of a bed to be richly\r\n      embroidered all over with stories in small figures, this being\r\n      considered the most gorgeous decoration of the kind that has\r\n      ever been executed in similar work, seeing that the designs\r\n      of Francesco have been worked in embroidery, thickly mingled\r\n      with pearls and other costly material, by Antonio, the brother\r\n      of Francesco, who is an excellent master in embroidery\" (iv.\r\n      492). It would appear from Vasari's account that Francesco's\r\n      works consisted of _predelle_ for altar-pieces, and pictorial\r\n      adornments for wedding chests, and other pieces of \"art\r\n      furniture.\"[236] Morelli, however, in an interesting chapter\r\n      on Bacchiacca (_Roman Galleries_, pp. 103-113), claims for him\r\n      a much more important position, ascribing to him among other\r\n      works the charming and celebrated \"Portrait of a Boy\" in the\r\n      Louvre, commonly attributed to Raphael.\r\n\r\nThe present panels decorated the room in the house at Florence, from\r\nwhich Pontormo's picture of Joseph also comes (see under 1131); they\r\nwere doubtless painted for \"cassoni,\" or large chests which were used\r\nby the Italians of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries\r\nas wardrobes. \"In those palmy days art was welcomed everywhere in\r\nItaly, and had a share in all the concerns of men, and in all the\r\nevents and festivities of daily life. The nobles took a delight in\r\nenriching their palaces, their country houses, and the chapels in\r\ntheir churches, with paintings and sculpture, and even required that\r\ntheir household furniture should, whilst useful, be graceful and\r\nbeautiful.\" Our panels were purchased many years ago from the heirs of\r\nthe Borgherini.\r\n\r\nSeveral incidents occur in each of the two pictures, but the main\r\nfigures constantly recur, and we recognise them by their dress and\r\nlook. (1218). On the left, in this picture, are Joseph's brethren\r\ntravelling in search of corn towards the land of Egypt, quaint figures\r\nin fantastic dresses, with little Benjamin, a child in a blue frock,\r\nand Reuben weeping, and another brother trying in vain to console him.\r\n\"And the famine was sore in the land.... And the men took ... Benjamin;\r\nand rose up, and went down to Egypt\" (Genesis xliii. 1, 15). On the\r\nright in the same picture is Joseph welcoming his brothers in the\r\nportico of the palace, Pharaoh's armed guard outside looking rather\r\ngrimly and inhospitably on the intruders. The landscape is green and\r\npicturesque. It is noticeable that blue (the colour of hope) is here\r\nmade sacred to Joseph and Benjamin, the children of promise, who are in\r\nevery instance dressed alike.\r\n\r\n(1219). In the companion panel the further history of Joseph and his\r\nbrethren is depicted in three scenes or compartments, divided by\r\npillars. On the left are the brothers unloading the donkey of the\r\nempty meal-jars, now to be filled through Joseph's kindness. In the\r\ncentre is Joseph making himself known to his eleven brethren. He is\r\ngazing tenderly on little Benjamin, who advances towards him in the\r\nforeground. \"And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph: doth my\r\nfather yet live?\" (Genesis xlv. 3). On the right are seen the brethren\r\ndeparting homeward, and the mule laden with Benjamin and the filled\r\nmeal-bags is being driven off.\r\n\r\n\r\n1220. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD\r\n\r\n  _L' Ingegno_ (Umbrian: painted 1484-1511).\r\n\r\n      This is the only picture, says the Official Catalogue, which\r\n      can be authenticated \"with something like certainty\" as the\r\n      work of Andrea di Luigi, of Assisi. His name occurs in receipts\r\n      and registers from 1505 to 1511, in the capacity of procurator,\r\n      arbitrator, auditor to the magistracy, and finally of papal\r\n      cashier at Assisi. It was perhaps this \"talent\" for affairs\r\n      that won him the name of \"L' Ingegno.\" Vasari says he was the\r\n      most promising disciple of Perugino, and the resemblance to\r\n      that artist in this picture is strong. Compare for instance\r\n      even so small a thing as the dress patterns here with those in\r\n      288, as also the close resemblance to the \"purist\" landscape\r\n      there described.\r\n\r\n\r\n1221. \"DARBY AND JOAN.\"\r\n\r\n  _Abraham de Pape_ (Dutch: died 1666).\r\n\r\n      This painter, a friend and pupil of Gerard Dou, was a\r\n      well-to-do citizen of Leyden. He was twice Dean of the\r\n      Painters' Guild in that place. This picture (formerly in the\r\n      Blenheim Collection) is considered one of the best of his\r\n      works. The painter's name is inscribed on the wooden cupboard\r\n      on the wall above the spinning-wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n1222. A STUDY OF FOLIAGE, BIRDS, ETC.\r\n\r\n  _Melchior de Hondecoeter_ (Dutch: 1636-1695). _See 202._\r\n\r\nFormerly ascribed to Otto Marseus; but the defaced part of the\r\nsignature has recently been deciphered as being that of Hondecoeter,\r\ndated 1668.\r\n\r\n\r\n1227. VIRGIN AND CHILD\r\n\r\n  _Marcello Venusti_ (Florentine: 1515-1579). _See 1194._\r\n\r\nAlso St. Joseph and St. John the Baptist, with the skin of a wild beast\r\nquaintly treated as a head-dress. A picture from a composition by\r\nMichael Angelo, known as \"Il Silenzio.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1229. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Luis de Morales_ (Spanish: 1509-1586).\r\n\r\n      Luis de Morales was born at Badajos, and is one of the most\r\n      native of Spanish artists. He did not resort to Italy, such\r\n      foreign influence as is discernible in him being rather that of\r\n      the Flemings; and the religious sanctity of his work won him\r\n      the surname of \"the Divine.\" \"His subjects, always devotional,\r\n      were,\" we are told, \"mostly of the saddest, as the Saviour in\r\n      his hour of suffering, or dead in his mother's arms, or the\r\n      weeping Madonna. His object was to excite devotion through\r\n      images of pain, and to this end the forms are attenuated and\r\n      the faces disfigured by the marks of past or present anguish.\"\r\n      He was very largely commissioned by churches and convents,\r\n      and his fame spread over Spain. He was called to the court of\r\n      Philip II. in 1563, but was dismissed as soon as he had painted\r\n      one picture, and thereafter he fell into great poverty. He\r\n      had appeared at court, it is said, \"in the style of a grand\r\n      _seigneur_\" which seemed to the king and his courtiers absurd\r\n      in a mere painter, and was the cause of their disfavour. Some\r\n      years later, however, the king, learning of his poverty,\r\n      granted him a pension. In his earlier period, Morales painted\r\n      crowded compositions with numerous figures; in his later,\r\n      smaller pictures, such as the one before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n1230. PORTRAIT OF A GIRL.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Ghirlandajo_ (Florentine: 1449-1494).\r\n\r\n      The name of Ghirlandajo is one of the great landmarks in the\r\n      history of Florentine art. He was the first to introduce\r\n      portraits into \"historical\" pictures for their own sake, and\r\n      his series of frescoes in S. Maria Novella is particularly\r\n      interesting for the numerous portraits of his friends and\r\n      patrons, dressed in the costume of the period and introduced\r\n      into scenes of Florentine life and architecture. \"There is a\r\n      bishop,\" says Vasari, \"in his episcopal vestments and with\r\n      spectacles on his nose\"--Ghirlandajo was the first master who\r\n      ventured to paint a figure wearing spectacles--\"he is chanting\r\n      the prayers for the dead; and the fact that we do not hear\r\n      him alone demonstrates to us that he is not alive, but merely\r\n      painted.\" These groups of men and women in Ghirlandajo's\r\n      sacred compositions stand by in the costume of their day as\r\n      spectators of the incidents represented. He introduced also the\r\n      architecture of Florence in the richest display and in complete\r\n      perspective; and thus in his subjects taken from sacred story\r\n      he has left us \"an exalted picture of life as it presented\r\n      itself to him in that day.\" \"In the technical management of\r\n      fresco Ghirlandajo exhibits an unsurpassed finish, and worked\r\n      in it with extraordinary facility. He is said to have expressed\r\n      a wish that he might be allowed to paint in fresco the whole\r\n      of the walls which enclosed the city of Florence.\" He was\r\n      carried off by the plague in his forty-fifth year, but he had\r\n      already completed a very large body of work. He was the son of\r\n      a silk-broker named Bigordi. He and his brother David, who was\r\n      also a painter, were apprenticed to a goldsmith. Their master\r\n      probably manufactured the garlands of gold and silver which\r\n      were so much in favour with the women of Florence, and the\r\n      young men coming from his shop thus acquired the name of _del\r\n      Ghirlandajo_. Domenico early showed his bent by the striking\r\n      likenesses he drew of the people who passed by the goldsmith's\r\n      shop. He remained to the end of his life, says Ruskin, \"a\r\n      goldsmith with a gift of portraiture.\" As early as 1475 his\r\n      reputation was established, for in that year he was called to\r\n      Rome to paint in the Sistine Chapel, where his \"Calling of\r\n      Peter and Andrew\" is still well preserved. Among the frescoes\r\n      executed after his return to Florence may be mentioned the \"St.\r\n      Jerome\" in the church of the Ognissanti, the history of \"St.\r\n      Francis\" in the Trinita, and the famous series in the choir of\r\n      S. Maria Novella. Copies from several of these works may be\r\n      seen in the Arundel Society's Collection. They are described by\r\n      Ruskin in his _Mornings in Florence_ (see also _Praeterita_,\r\n      vol. ii., and numerous incidental references in _Modern\r\n      Painters_). Ghirlandajo had not, perhaps, Giotto's dramatic\r\n      instinct for the heart of his subjects, but his frescoes are\r\n      remarkable, not only for their brilliantly decorative effect,\r\n      but for their noble and dignified realism. In the Uffizi at\r\n      Florence are his best easel pictures. There is also a fine\r\n      \"Visitation\" in the Louvre. Ghirlandajo was celebrated further\r\n      as a worker in mosaic (_e.g._ the mosaic over the north door of\r\n      the Cathedral at Florence). He was twice married. The painter\r\n      Ridolfo (1143) was a son by his first wife. Amongst his other\r\n      pupils were Granacci and Michael Angelo.\r\n\r\nThe girl is of the same type--with the same hair, \"yellow as ripe\r\ncorn,\" and the same dainty primness--as the lady in Mr. Willett's\r\npicture (for some years on loan in the National Gallery, and now in\r\nthe collection of M. Rodolphe Kann at Paris), but she was perhaps of\r\nhumbler station--a simple flower in her hair and a coral necklace being\r\nher only ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n1231. PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Sir Antonio More_ (Flemish: 1512-1578). _See 1094._\r\n\r\n\"A man in the prime of life, attributed to Sir Antonio Moro; the\r\nsignature is perhaps apocryphal. There is little doubt, however, that\r\nthe attribution is correct; the manipulation shows all the prodigious\r\npower of Moro. His capacity for seizing character and the fine tone of\r\nhis flesh colour are all here. The execution suggests the brilliant\r\nstudy of Hubert Goltzius, by Moro, in the Brussels Gallery. That\r\nmasterpiece was stated to have been painted in an hour; the present\r\nhead bears every indication of almost equally rapid brush work\"\r\n(_Times_, September 19, 1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n1232. PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Heinrich Aldegrever_ (Westphalian: about 1502-1555).\r\n\r\n      \"Aldegrever is a son of the Renaissance, but he has not\r\n      altogether escaped the old Franconian stiffness and\r\n      provincialism.... His real strength is in engraving.... He\r\n      worked also as a goldsmith, and his ornamental designs are\r\n      numerous. We also know of a small number of woodcuts by him\"\r\n      (_Woltmann_, ii. 234). His pictures are very rare. The flower\r\n      and ring which figure in the best known portrait by him at\r\n      Vienna are again met with here, but this picture is less stiff\r\n      and formal than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n1233. THE BLOOD OF THE REDEEMER.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_ (Venetian: 1426-1516). _See 189._\r\n\r\nA devotional picture recalling such reminiscences of mediæval mysticism\r\nas are found in many of our hymns--\r\n\r\n    Come let us stand beneath his Cross:\r\n      So may the blood from out his side\r\n    Fall gently on us drop by drop.\r\n      Jesus our Lord is crucified.\r\n\r\n\"A cold sky with underlit clouds suggests the still and solemn hour\r\nof early dawn, a fitting time for the advent of this weird and\r\nlivid apparition. Gaunt, bloodless, and with attenuated limbs, the\r\nRedeemer, we recognise, has passed through the Valley of 'the Shadow\r\nof Death'--not victoriously; there is no light of triumph in the\r\nlustreless eyes; no palm nor crown awaits this victim of relentless\r\nhate, the type of infinite despair and eternal sacrifice\" (_Times_,\r\nSeptember 19, 1887)--\r\n\r\n    Sunrise is close: the upper sky is blue\r\n    That has been darkness; and the day is new,\r\n    Bleaching yon little town: where the white hue,\r\n      Spread blank on the horizon, skirts\r\n    The night-mass there is strife and wavy rush\r\n        Of beams in flush....\r\n    The dawn is blue among the hills and white\r\n    Above their tops; a gladness creeps in sight\r\n    Across the silver-russet slopes, but night\r\n      Obscures the mortal ebb and flow\r\n    Flushing Thy veins; Thy lips in strife for breath\r\n          Are full of death.\r\n\r\n  (\"Michael Field\" in _Sight and Song_.)\r\n\r\nThe looks and gestures of the Saviour seem to demonstrate that\r\nthe blood which pours from His riven side is freely given for the\r\nredemption of the world. In the details of the picture, which careless\r\nobservers might mistake for mere chance accessories, there is an\r\nallegorical meaning. The paved terrace with the open doorway symbolises\r\nthe Paradise regained by the Blood of the Sacrificed, the ideal\r\nChurch, the Church of the New Covenant, in contradistinction to the\r\nHortus Inclusus, the garden enclosed, without a door, which was the\r\ntype of the Old Covenant. The antique reliefs are pagan prototypes of\r\nthe Christian sacrifice. On the right is Mucius Scaevola, before Lars\r\nPorsena, thrusting his hand into the fire,--the ancient type of heroism\r\nand readiness to suffer; on the opposite side is a pagan sacrifice,\r\nwith Pan playing the pipes, signifying the propitiatory sacrifices of\r\nthe ancients, and thus foreshadowing the Sacrifice on the Cross. The\r\nlandscape background carries out the same ideas. On the right is a\r\nbarren hill with leafless trees, and at its base some ancient ruins\r\nand a crumbling fountain. In contrast to this on the opposite side is\r\na prosperous and well-fortified city, lying amid meadows; a church\r\ntower; the sky above is rosy with the light of early dawn. Figures are\r\nseen turning from the ancient ruins and making their way along the path\r\nwhich leads to a new and better home, the Christian city (Richter's\r\n_Lectures on the National Gallery_, p. 37).\r\n\r\nThis little picture is among the earliest of Bellini's works. The\r\nabnormal length of the figure of Christ and the exaggerated length and\r\nstraightness of the forearms are points which should be noticed in\r\nthis connection, resembling as they do characteristics of other early\r\nworks by the painter, and also the drawings of his father, Jacopo. But\r\n\"already, in spite of the archaism of form, he shows a feeling for\r\natmospheric tonality; the ruin to the right and the two figures near it\r\nare, as painters say, in their place; that is to say, the treatment as\r\nregards relations of tone is such as the linear perspective would lead\r\nus to expect. Still more surprising is the way in which the eye is led\r\ndown the valley to free spaces of luminous air\" (Roger Fry: _Giovanni\r\nBellini_, p. 18). The subject is a rare one in Italian art. Mr. Fry\r\ngives a reproduction of a similar figure in a picture by Crivelli in\r\nthe Poldi Pezzoli Collection at Milan; and Dr. Richter, one from a\r\nwoodcut in Savonarola's treatise on \"Humility,\" first printed in 1492.\r\n\r\n\r\n1234. \"A MUSE INSPIRING A COURT POET.\"\r\n\r\n  _Dosso Dossi_ (Ferrarese: 1479-1542). _See 640._\r\n\r\nCalled a \"court poet\" because, one may suppose, of his sleek and\r\nuninspired appearance; but poets do not always look their parts, and\r\n'tis the function of the Muse \"to mould the secret gold.\" But perhaps\r\nthe artist had some gently sarcastic intention, for it is but a small\r\nsprig that the Muse has spared to the poet from her garland. The head\r\nof the poet is clearly a portrait. That of the Muse \"is as fine in\r\ntechnique and condition as anything in the whole range of Dossi's work\"\r\n(Benson).\r\n\r\n\r\n1239, 1240. THE MURDER OF THE INNOCENTS.\r\n\r\n  _Girolamo Mocetto_ (Venetian: worked 1484-1514).\r\n\r\n      Mocetto was a native of Verona, but a pupil of Giovanni Bellini\r\n      at Venice. He was \"one of the earliest,\" says Lanzi (ii. 167),\r\n      \"and least polished among Bellini's disciples.\" And it is\r\n      interesting to contrast the accomplished and beautiful work of\r\n      the master (1233) with the almost ludicrous imperfections of\r\n      these two pictures by the pupil. Notice especially the absurd\r\n      attitude of the attendant to the left, in 1239; and in 1240,\r\n      the expression of grief in the mother. Mocetto's claim to\r\n      distinction rests rather on his rare engravings, executed from\r\n      the designs of Giovanni Bellini and Mantegna. He \"was also the\r\n      painter of the great window in the church of SS. Giovanni e\r\n      Paolo (Venice), which, although badly restored, still remains\r\n      a magnificent work\" (Layard, i. 332).\r\n\r\nThese works probably formed the wings of a triptych. In the former\r\nscene Herod directs the massacre which has already begun; in the\r\nsecond, the massacre is at its height.\r\n\r\n\r\n1241. CHRIST PREACHING IN THE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n  _Pedro Campaña_ (Flemish-Italian: 1503-1580).\r\n\r\n      The painter of this picture forms an interesting link in the\r\n      history of art. \"In Spain the influence exercised over the\r\n      national school by the northern Gothic masters was weakened\r\n      at an early stage by the Italian Renaissance. Strange to say,\r\n      a Fleming, who had learned his art in the school of Michael\r\n      Angelo, was the chief instrument by which Italy asserted her\r\n      power. Peter de Kampencer, to whom the Spaniards gave the\r\n      name of Pedro Campaña, was born in Brussels. He left Italy,\r\n      where he had enjoyed the protection of Cardinal Grimani, for\r\n      Seville (1548), where he founded an academy.\" Luis de Morales\r\n      (see 1229) is said to have been among his disciples. One of\r\n      his masterpieces, a \"Descent from the Cross,\" in Santa Cruz,\r\n      was the picture which Murillo was never tired of admiring (see\r\n      the story told under 13). Besides such large altar-pieces,\r\n      \"he was accustomed,\" says Lanzi (i. 402, Bohn's edition), \"to\r\n      paint small pictures, which were eagerly sought after by the\r\n      English, and transferred to their country, where they were\r\n      highly prized.\" In 1560 Campaña returned to his native city,\r\n      and became official painter to the tapestry works there.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this \"celebrated picture\" (as Lanzi calls it) is \"The\r\nMagdalen led by St. Martha to the Temple, to hear the preaching of\r\nChrist.\" Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus, is identified in\r\nlegend with the Magdalen, and her conversion is said to have begun with\r\nthe incident here depicted. The kneeling figure of the Magdalen is\r\nconspicuous amongst the women listeners; she is encouraged by Martha,\r\nwho points to the preacher (see Mrs. Jameson's _Sacred and Legendary\r\nArt_, p. 219, ed. 1850, for other representations of this subject).\r\n\r\n\r\n1243. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _C. W. Heimbach_ (German: 1613-1678).\r\n\r\nDated 1662. Notice the characteristic \"steeple-crowned\" hat.\r\n\r\n\r\n1247. THE CARD PLAYERS.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Maes_ (Dutch: 1632-1693). _See 153._\r\n\r\nThis picture, purchased in 1888 at the sale of the Gatton Park\r\n(Lord Oxenbridge's) Collection, was stated by the auctioneer to be\r\nby Rembrandt, but there is little doubt that it is really by his\r\ndisciple, Maes; though, as it is larger than most of the known works\r\nby that master, other critics have ascribed it to another pupil of\r\nRembrandt, Carl Faber, or Fabricius. \"In any case it is unmistakably\r\nof the Rembrandt school, and owes its inspiration to the method of\r\npresentation peculiar to the master. From every technical point of\r\nview it is first-rate. It is infused with the largeness of style, the\r\njust appreciation of character, and the glowing colour, to be found\r\nin Rembrandt's matured works. It is the turn of the girl to play. She\r\nregards her hand in evident perplexity, doubtful which card to throw\r\ndown. The man is apparently sure of his game\" (_Times_, June 4, 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n1248. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Bartholomeus van der Helst_ (Dutch: 1611-1670). _See 140._\r\n\r\nThe sitter belonged to the Braganza family. So prematurely demure\r\nis this plain little girl that, in spite of the fact that her hair\r\nis \"down\" and that she wears a round nursery cap, she is dignified\r\nwith the title of \"A Lady.\" She is certainly every inch a grown-up\r\nlady in her rich brocade dress, pearl necklace, and costly feathers.\r\nVan der Helst gave special attention, says Sir F. Burton, to \"the\r\ndiscrimination of stuffs, and his skill in reproducing the lustre\r\nand shimmer of jewellery or gold embroidery and the delicacy of the\r\nlace-worker's art has never been equalled.\" The picture is signed, and\r\ndated 1645.\r\n\r\n\r\n1251. PORTRAIT OF A MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Frans Hals_ (Dutch: 1580-1666). _See 1021._\r\n\r\nIt is only at Haarlem that the full power of Hals can be seen; but this\r\npicture shows something of his dash and facility. There is, indeed,\r\nupon it a stamp of power and individuality, alike in conception and\r\ntreatment, which makes it one of the most interesting portraits in the\r\nGallery. It is signed with the painter's monogram, and dated 1633.\r\nPossibly it is a portrait of the painter himself; and certainly it\r\nshows the type of a man to which Hals belonged--Hals, the dashing\r\nvolunteer who fought in the military guilds, the good-for-nothing,\r\ndaredevil fellow who loved his glass and was none too faithful in his\r\ndomestic relations, whose excesses brought him finally to penury,\r\nbut whose high spirit and unfailing dash enabled him to remain true,\r\nthrough it all, to the calling of his art.\r\n\r\n\r\n1252. A FRUIT-PIECE.\r\n\r\n  _Frans Snyders_ (Flemish: 1579-1657).\r\n\r\n      Snyders was one of the principal Flemish painters of animals\r\n      and still life, and his talents were so much admired by Rubens\r\n      that the latter often employed him to paint fruit, game, and\r\n      other accessories in his pictures. Rubens in exchange sometimes\r\n      drew the figures in pictures by Snyders, whom, as a last proof\r\n      of affection, he appointed by will to manage the sale of his\r\n      works of art. Snyders received many commissions, too, from the\r\n      Archduke Albert and from Philip III. of Spain. His earlier\r\n      pictures were confined to representations--such as this one\r\n      of fruit and vegetables, or of dead game and fish. In the\r\n      establishment of his parents, who were proprietors of a large\r\n      eating-house, he had ample opportunity of studying such models.\r\n      \"Snyders is not to be surpassed,\" says Sir F. Burton, \"in\r\n      the painting of fruit. With his fine appreciation of colour,\r\n      and his large method of handling, he reproduced with few but\r\n      masterly touches the characteristic surface of each luscious\r\n      product of the garden, with greater truth to nature than was\r\n      generally attained by those painters who sought it by means of\r\n      minute and laborious imitation.\" Afterwards Snyders enlarged\r\n      his scope, and produced those scenes of the chase for which he\r\n      became celebrated. The vigour which Snyders threw into these\r\n      productions is extraordinary, but pictures of animals in savage\r\n      chase or butchered agony do not appeal to all tastes. \"I know\r\n      no pictures,\" says Ruskin, \"more shameful to humanity than the\r\n      boar and lion hunts of Rubens and Snyders, signs of disgrace\r\n      all the deeper because the powers desecrated are so great. The\r\n      painter of the village ale-house sign may, not dishonourably,\r\n      paint the fox-hunt for the village squire; but the occupation\r\n      of magnificent art power in giving semblance of perpetuity to\r\n      those bodily pangs which Nature has mercifully ordained to\r\n      be transient, and in forcing us, by the fascination of its\r\n      stormy skill, to dwell on that from which eyes of merciful\r\n      men should instinctively turn away, and eyes of high-minded\r\n      men scornfully, is dishonourable alike in the power which it\r\n      degrades, and the joy to which it betrays\" (_Modern Painters_,\r\n      vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. § 19).\r\n\r\n\r\n1255. A STUDY OF STILL LIFE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Jans van de Velde_ (Dutch: born 1622).\r\n\r\n      This rare painter, perhaps the son of Jan van de Velde, the\r\n      engraver, was settled at Amsterdam in 1642. Besides being a\r\n      painter he was in business as a broker, and was described in\r\n      the marriage register as a silver-wire drawer. This picture is\r\n      dated 1656.\r\n\r\n\r\n1256. A STUDY OF STILL LIFE.\r\n\r\n  _Herman Steenwyck_ (Dutch: 17th Century).\r\n\r\n      This Steenwyck is not to be confused with the painter of\r\n      architectural interiors (see 1132). Herman, and a brother,\r\n      Pieter, were painters of still-life subjects at Leyden.\r\n\r\n\r\n1257. THE BIRTH OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Murillo_ (Spanish: 1618-1682). _See 13._\r\n\r\nA sketch for the large picture now in the Louvre (No. 540). \"Like so\r\nmany of the sketches of Murillo, it is so light in touch,\" says one\r\nof the critics, \"so exquisite in colour, as to be, from an artistic\r\npoint of view, preferable to the finished picture.\" This, however, is\r\nnot the only advantage which Murillo gains from smallness of scale.\r\nThere is a prettiness, and even a sentimentality, permissible on a\r\nsmall scale which offends the dignity of a large canvas. Thus, the\r\n\"affectation\" of the attendant angels is far less \"absurd\" here than in\r\nthe large picture. \"One of the cherubs shrinks back,\" adds Mr. Eastlake\r\nin his Louvre catalogue, \"frightened at a dog, which seems a strangely\r\nhuman act of weakness; another holds up a piece of baby-linen, with a\r\nprovokingly fantastic air.\" But herein we have the very characteristics\r\nwhich make the religious sentiment of Murillo's pictures interesting.\r\nIn the early Italian pictures the Virgin is a great lady, living in a\r\nfine house or spacious cloister. But in Spain the symbols of devotion\r\npassed into realities; and a combination of mysticism in conception\r\nwith realism in treatment is the distinguishing \"note\" of the Spanish\r\nreligious school. One could not wish for a prettier presentment of this\r\nmingled note than is afforded by this little sketch, with its angels\r\nhalf in ecstatic adoration over the \"Lily of Eden,\" and half in human\r\nplayfulness--a sketch which seems to combine with the frank realities\r\nof a humble nursery the religious sentiment of Keble's _Christian\r\nYear_:--\r\n\r\n    Ave Maria! blessed maid!\r\n    Lily of Eden's fragrant shade,\r\n      Who can express the love\r\n    That nurtured thee so pure and sweet,\r\n    Making thy heart a shelter meet\r\n      For Jesus' Holy Dove!\r\n\r\n\r\n1258. A STUDY OF STILL LIFE\r\n\r\n  _J. B. S. Chardin_ (French: 1699-1779).\r\n\r\n      Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin was the contemporary of Boucher\r\n      (1090), and his pictures may serve to remind us that there was\r\n      a _bourgeoisie_ in France as well as a _noblesse_ when Louis\r\n      XV. was king. The simple subject of this picture--a loaf of\r\n      brown bread, with a bottle of wine, spread out on a piece of\r\n      old newspaper--takes us far away from the luxurious trifling\r\n      of the Court painters. Chardin followed the path of frank\r\n      realism, treating, however, all his subjects with refinement.\r\n      To Dutch precision he added Gallic grace. He painted either\r\n      still life (as here) or scenes from the domestic life of the\r\n      people (as in 1664, and in a picture in the Dulwich Gallery).\r\n      His treatment was devoid of affectation, and his colouring\r\n      fresh and agreeable. \"He is the best colourist in the Salon,\"\r\n      said Diderot of him in his lifetime. Chardin, in the exercise\r\n      of his honest industry, knew how difficult it was to excel,\r\n      and said on one occasion to Diderot and the other critics,\r\n      \"Gently, good sirs, gently! Out of all the pictures that are\r\n      here seek the very worst; and know that two thousand unhappy\r\n      wretches have bitten their brushes in two with their teeth, in\r\n      despair of ever doing even so badly.\" Chardin's fellow-workers\r\n      appreciated his merits, and he was elected a member of the\r\n      Academy in 1728, becoming Treasurer of that body in 1755. There\r\n      is a large collection of his works in the Louvre. They fell\r\n      into disrepute during the succeeding reign of David and the\r\n      \"classical\" school, but they have again won a high position\r\n      in the estimation of those who know. This picture (which is\r\n      signed, and dated 1754) was presented to the Gallery; for No.\r\n      1664, purchased in 1898, the sum of £721 was paid.\r\n\r\nChardin's pictures show that instinctive \"power of reticence\" which is\r\none of the secrets of fine art. \"It is what gives value to such humble\r\nefforts as the study of still-life subjects, and raises them--as in\r\nthe works of the French painters, Chardin especially, and of some of\r\nthe Dutch painters--above the level of mere mechanical imitations,\r\nand transforms them into works capable of giving us real pleasure\"\r\n(Poynter's _Lectures on Art_, p. 195).\r\n\r\n\r\n1260-1270. EARLY GREEK PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\nThese eleven portraits are part of the find by Mr. Flinders Petrie, in\r\nhis excavations at Hawara, in the Fayoum (Middle Egypt), and are of\r\ngreat interest as supplying a fresh link in the historical development\r\nof art as exhibited in the National Gallery. Here is portraiture in\r\nits infancy. But even these portraits, done probably by Græco-Egyptian\r\nartists in the second or third century A.D., are later developments\r\nfrom an earlier stage. They were affixed to the outside covering of\r\nmummies in a position corresponding to the head of the corpse:[237] the\r\nexact arrangement can be seen in two mummies from the same \"find,\" now\r\nin the British Museum. \"They are derived,\" says Miss Amelia B. Edwards,\r\n\"by a clearly traced process of evolution from the portrait-heads\r\nfirst modelled in stucco upon Egyptian mummy cases, and then painted.\r\nFrom coloured portraiture in high relief to coloured portraiture on\r\nflexible canvas, where a certain amount of relief was obtained by\r\nthe prominence of the bandaged face beneath, was one step; and from\r\nthe flexible canvas to the panel upon which the semblance of relief\r\nwas given by light and shadow and foreshortening was another and\r\nfar more important step. It marked the transition from the Eastern\r\nto the Western school of painting.\" The portraits are painted with\r\npigments of rich colour on thin panels of cedar wood, wax being the\r\nmedium employed. \"The rather lumpy surface or _impasto_ which comes\r\nfrom the use of a wax medium is very obvious. The melted wax rapidly\r\nhardened when the brush touched the cold surface of the panel, and so\r\nprevented the pigment from being laid in a smooth, even manner. The\r\nwood was not, like stucco, sufficiently absorbent for the subsequent\r\napplication of heat to get rid of the lumpy surface by driving the\r\nsuperfluous wax below the surface\" (Middleton's _Remains of Ancient\r\nRome_, i. 100). The persons buried with these panel portraits were\r\nmostly of Greek origin; but some--as, for instance, the man (No. 1265,\r\npresented by Mr. Haworth)--seemed rather to be of the Roman type.\r\nThe faces exhibit all variations, from living grace to the emptiest\r\nvacuity. It has been suggested that \"the better portraits were painted\r\nfrom the life, whilst in other cases the painter was perhaps only\r\nsent for after death, and this may account for the vague and lifeless\r\nlooks of many of the portraits, inanimate in spite of the wide,\r\nopen, and vacuous smile.\" It will be noticed that \"the style of the\r\nportraits is usually conventional precisely in those details which\r\nmake the difference between one living face and another. The eyes,\r\nwhich more than any other feature should impart the living expression\r\nin all these cases, are executed in a perfunctory and formal manner.\r\nAnd they are, moreover, in many cases too large for the face. This\r\nis not merely due to the inability of the artists, for many of these\r\nportraits show a real grasp of character and a distinct technical\r\nskill in the modelling, notably in that, perhaps, most difficult\r\nof tasks, the indication of the play of muscles around the mouth.\r\nUnder these circumstances I think no one will deny that the measure\r\nof success achieved in some of the best of these portraits is very\r\nremarkable. The old man in particular (1265) shows a breadth of style\r\nand a quiet humour which reminds us of some of the Dutch masters of\r\nthe Teniers school. Of course there are good and bad among them;\r\nthe quality probably depended to some extent upon the price which\r\nthe relative could afford to pay. One wonders what the price may\r\nhave been, especially when we read of the enormous sums which great\r\npictures fetched in the palmy days of Greek painting. Most of these\r\npeople seem to have been well to do, as the gold wreaths of the men\r\nand the jewellery of the women prove\" (Cecil Smith, ch. vi. of W. M.\r\nF. Petrie's _Hawara, Biahmu, and Arsinoe_: 1889). No. 1261 retains the\r\ngreater part of a gilt gesso border, stamped or modelled with a wavy\r\ntendril and bud pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n1277. A MAN'S PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Maes_ (Dutch: 1632-1693). _See 153._\r\n\r\nSigned, and dated 1666. A singularly lifelike portrait of a singularly\r\nunattractive face.\r\n\r\n\r\n1278. A CONVIVIAL PARTY.\r\n\r\n  _Hendrik Gerritsz Pot_ (Dutch: about 1600-1656).\r\n\r\n      The picture is signed HP (on the side of the projecting\r\n      chimney). Several pictures--chiefly conversation-pieces and\r\n      portraits (including one of Charles I. in the Louvre)--bear\r\n      these initials. They are supposed to belong to the above-named\r\n      artist, of whom it is recorded that he visited England and made\r\n      portraits of the king.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary scene of the kind, but there is a pleasant touch in the\r\nlittle dog who furtively licks the hand of its half-tipsy master.\r\n\r\n\r\n1280. CHRIST APPEARING AFTER HIS RESURRECTION\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Early Flemish: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nThe Virgin Mary sits on the edge of an old-fashioned bedstead. Christ,\r\nwith the marks of the wounds in breast and feet, faces her, and behind\r\nhim is a great company of saints, kneeling. Highly finished throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n1282. SAN ZENOBIO RESTORING TO LIFE A DEAD CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Jacopo Chimenti da Empoli_ (Florentine: 1554-1640).\r\n\r\n      Chimenti, of Empoli, near Florence, was \"an imitator of\r\n      Andrea del Sarto, and distinguished for his Madonnas; he was\r\n      distinguished also for his love of good eating, and acquired\r\n      from his contemporaries the nickname of _L' Empilo_, instead of\r\n      L' Empoli, which is as much as to say stewpan\" (Wornum, _Epochs\r\n      of Painting_, p. 356). He was largely employed in the churches\r\n      of Florence and the neighbourhood. His best production is his\r\n      \"St. Ives\" in the Uffizi: \"in noble conception and truth and\r\n      glow of colour it reminds us of the best of the old Florentine\r\n      masters.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Zenobio (died A.D. 417) was a Bishop of Florence, famous in his\r\ntime for his eloquence and good works, and a favourite saint with\r\nthe Florentines in after ages. The following is the legend painted in\r\nthis picture:--\"A French lady of noble lineage, who was performing a\r\npilgrimage to Rome, stopped at Florence on the way, in order to see\r\nthe good bishop Zenobio, of whom she had heard so much, and having\r\nreceived his blessing she proceeded to Rome, leaving in his care her\r\nlittle son. The day before her return to Florence, the child died. She\r\nwas overwhelmed with grief, and took the child and laid him down at\r\nthe feet of St. Zenobio, who, by the efficacy of his prayers, restored\r\nthe child to life, and gave him back to the arms of his mother\" (Mrs.\r\nJameson, _Sacred and Legendary Art_, p. 415).\r\n\r\n\r\n1284. ST. FRANCIS AND ST. MARK.\r\n\r\n  _Antonio Vivarini_ (Venetian: died 1470). _See 768._\r\n\r\nA companion panel to the one already in the Gallery; see 768. The\r\ndesign of the pedestal is, it will be seen, the same in both.\r\n\r\n\r\n1285. PORTRAIT OF NAPOLEON I.\r\n\r\n  _Horace Vernet_ (French: 1789-1863).\r\n\r\n      Emile John Horace Vernet, soldier and artist, was the\r\n      grandson of Claude Joseph Vernet (236). He was decorated in\r\n      1814 by Napoleon for his gallant conduct before the enemy\r\n      at the Barrière de Clichy, on which occasion he served in a\r\n      regiment of hussars. In the Louvre there is a picture by him\r\n      representing the defence of Paris on that occasion. On the fall\r\n      of the Empire he left France for a time, but he gradually won\r\n      the favour of the court. In 1833 he joined the French army at\r\n      Algiers, and there gathered material for the huge battle-pieces\r\n      which he painted for Louis Philippe. The Crimean War furnished\r\n      him with another congenial set of subjects. His work had a\r\n      great vogue in its day, but owed more to its patriotic and\r\n      stirring subject-matter than to abiding artistic qualities.\r\n\r\nLess ideal than the beautiful sketch which David made of Napoleon\r\nas First Consul, or the later conventional pictures painted for\r\na generation which had not seen the original. There is no dreamy\r\nintensity in the eyes, and no engaging smile. The famous lock in the\r\ncentre of the forehead is there, and the face is still handsome,\r\nimposing, and resolute; but there is already something of the heaviness\r\nwhich presaged his fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n1286. A BOY DRINKING.\r\n\r\n  _Murillo_ (Spanish: 1618-1682). _See 13._\r\n\r\n\"The boy is resting his left arm on a table and holding a square\r\nbottle, like one of those used for schiedam. The head is finely\r\nmodelled, with a firm, broad touch; the bright eyes are deep set under\r\nthe brow, and they betray eager delight in the draught he is taking.\r\nThe flesh tones are unusually pure and bright for Murillo. The picture\r\nseems to be that which, named 'A Spanish Youth Drinking,' was sold in\r\n1836 with Lord Charles Townshend's collection for £414. With the Earl\r\nof Clare's pictures was sold, in 1864, 'A Peasant holding a Bottle and\r\ndrinking from a Glass,' which had belonged to Prince Talleyrand and\r\nLord C. Townshend,' for £1365\" (_Athenæum_).\r\n\r\n\r\n1287. INTERIOR OF AN ART GALLERY.\r\n\r\n  _Dutch School_ (17th Century).\r\n\r\nOf interest alike for its technical skill and for its historical\r\ninformation. No less than forty-two pictures hang upon the walls\r\nof the \"Art Gallery,\" and the collection is very interesting as\r\nshowing the taste of an amateur of the period. In addition to these,\r\nthere are globes, gems, maps, engravings, nautical instruments,\r\npieces of sculpture, and other \"objects of vertu\"--all painted with\r\nminiature-like delicacy. Especially charming is an elaborately inlaid\r\ncabinet with china and other \"curios\" upon it. Notice also the fine\r\nPersian carpet. The art treasures are being eagerly scanned by several\r\ngroups of connoisseurs, whilst--with a touch, perhaps, of satiric\r\nintent--a monkey is perched on the window-sill, criticising the\r\ncritics. It is interesting to note that with only three exceptions all\r\nthe paintings depicted in the Art Gallery are in black frames. This\r\nwas the common practice with the Low Country painters. Several of the\r\nlatest additions to the Dutch pictures in the Gallery are in their\r\noriginal black frames. The famous Teniers at Vienna of \"The Archduke's\r\nGallery\" is an equally apt illustration of the taste of Dutch and\r\nFlemish painters (_Athenæum_, 2nd January 1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n1288. FROST SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Aart van der Neer_ (Dutch: 1619-1692). _See 152._\r\n\r\n\r\n1289. LANDSCAPE WITH CATTLE.\r\n\r\n  _Cuyp_ (Dutch: 1620-1691). _See 53._\r\n\r\nA characteristic little work. In the distance is a ruined castle-keep\r\nin the water, which may be the same building as that depicted in No.\r\n824.\r\n\r\n\r\n1291. THE ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Juan de Valdes Leal_ (Spanish: 1630-1691).\r\n\r\n      Valdes Leal, who was born at Cordova, settled afterwards at\r\n      Seville, where he became the first President of the Academy\r\n      in that city. It is to him that some critics have assigned\r\n      the \"Dead Orlando\" in this room (741). His most famous\r\n      picture--\"one of the most repulsive, but also most impressive\r\n      ever painted,\" says Mr. W. B. Scott--is \"The Two Dead Men,\"\r\n      in the Hospital of Charity at Seville, representing a charnel\r\n      house with the partially-decayed corpses of a bishop and a\r\n      noble. So dreadful is the realism that Murillo said he never\r\n      could approach the picture without fancying he smelt the\r\n      horror. \"Ah, my compeer,\" replied the flattered realist, \"it\r\n      is not my fault; you have taken all the sweet fruit out of the\r\n      basket and left only the rotten.\"\r\n\r\nIn the present picture Valdes Leal has picked sweet fruit too;\r\nindeed it is over sweet. The donatrix of the picture and her son\r\nare shown in either corner, while in the midst the Virgin ascends\r\nto Heaven, surrounded by bands of angels. The picture is thoroughly\r\ncharacteristic, in its florid type of sentiment, of the Spanish school.\r\n\r\n\r\n1292. A FAMILY GROUP.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Bylert_ (Dutch: 1603-1671).\r\n\r\n      A painter of Utrecht; entered the Guild of Painters there in\r\n      1630, and repeatedly filled the office of its Dean. Studied at\r\n      Utrecht under A. Bloemaert, and afterwards visited Italy and\r\n      France. His works are numerous in the galleries of Amsterdam\r\n      and Utrecht.\r\n\r\nThey are plain old people, truth to tell, this group of two Dutch\r\nhousewives and a Dutch burgher, and they are somewhat too obviously\r\nsitting for their portraits. How prim and neat all the surroundings\r\nare! how pretty is the trailing rose on the balustrade! and with what\r\nquiet, unobtrusive fidelity the whole picture is painted!\r\n\r\n\r\n1293. MUSICAL PASTIME.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Miense Molenaer_ (Dutch: died 1668).\r\n\r\n      This painter, the best of three artists of the same name,\r\n      \"excelled in representing peasant interiors and scenes of\r\n      rustic life in a quiet style and in skilfully graduated tints.\r\n      His colouring is warm and clear; his drawing spirited, and\r\n      his touch full of life. Besides this, he possessed a certain\r\n      refinement, and his humour never overstepped the bounds of\r\n      decency. While his works retain characteristics peculiar to\r\n      him, they manifest also something of the styles of Steen,\r\n      Brauwer, and Ostade\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_, p. 159). He\r\n      was a native of Haarlem, and afterwards settled in Amsterdam.\r\n      His earlier works (such as the present picture) suggest the\r\n      tutelage of Frans Hals; the later works show the influence of\r\n      Rembrandt.\r\n\r\nThis picture (which is signed on the side of the foot-warmer) is a\r\ncapital example of the artist. \"The fair faces of the singers are very\r\nspontaneously expressive of their gaiety, and have something of the\r\nanimation of Jan Steen without his vulgar types and occasional grimace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1294. AN ALLEGORICAL SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n  _William van de Poorter_ (Dutch: painted 1630-1645).\r\n\r\n      This painter was a native of Haarlem, where he belonged to\r\n      the Guild of Painters, and was a pupil of Rembrandt. In this\r\n      picture the light, coming from the top on our left, falls on\r\n      the globe and figure with Rembrandtesque effect.\r\n\r\nThe subject is perhaps a \"Vigil of Arms,\" and may depict a knight or\r\nking passing the night before his investiture in the seclusion of\r\na private chapel. On the altar before which he stands are a globe,\r\ntwo crowns, and several documents. His left hand is turned slightly\r\nforward, as if to call attention to the action, while in his right hand\r\nhe holds a sceptre with its point resting on the globe. On the floor in\r\nfront of the altar lie his arms and armour; behind, hangs his banner.\r\nOn his head is a laurel wreath; and over a bright breastplate he wears\r\nthe richly embroidered robe of his order.\r\n\r\n\r\n1295. MADONNA AND CHILD, WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Girolamo Giovenone_ (Lombard: early 16th Century).\r\n\r\n      Giovenone was a native of Vercelli, in which city several fine\r\n      pictures by him are preserved. Other painters who worked, or\r\n      were born, at Vercelli are Macrino d' Alba (1200), Lanini\r\n      (700), and Gaudenzio Ferrari (1465). By some critics our\r\n      picture is assigned to another painter of the same school,\r\n      Defendente Ferrari (see Catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts\r\n      Club's Exhibition, 1898, p. lxxix.). Examples of both painters\r\n      may be seen in the Turin Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe Virgin and Child are flanked by the kneeling figures of two men,\r\nperhaps brothers, who were doubtless the donors of the picture. Behind\r\neach of them stands his patron saint, patting the devotee approvingly\r\non the back. The Virgin's face is charming; so also are two little\r\nangels, who are quaintly perched up aloft, one on either side sitting\r\non ledges of the canopied throne. The picture is a good example of\r\nsymmetry--almost exaggerated, one may think--in composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n1296, 1297. LANDSCAPES.\r\n\r\n  _Giuseppe Zais_ (Venetian: died 1784).\r\n\r\n      Zais, a Venetian, was a pupil of the Florentine landscape and\r\n      decorative painter Zuccarelli (1702-1788) who settled for many\r\n      years at Venice. Zuccarelli in 1752 came to this country, where\r\n      in 1768 he became an original member of the Royal Academy.\r\n      The works of Zais also for a time attracted the attention of\r\n      English amateurs, but he died a pauper in the hospital of\r\n      Treviso.\r\n\r\nAmusing examples of the so-called \"pastoral landscape,\" which found\r\nfavour in the last century--the landscape painted \"in praise of\r\nthe country by men who lived in coffee-houses.\" Zais was nearly\r\ncontemporary with Longhi, and shows us the same Venetians in\r\n_villeggiatura_ whom Longhi shows us in town (see 1100 and 1101). In\r\n1286 we see some \"picturesque\" farm-buildings on one side of a stream,\r\nwith a \"picturesque\" cow-herd asleep; whilst on the other side is a\r\nparty of gay ladies--dressed in crinolines and bows, and devoid of\r\nhats, shawls, or wraps--flirting with _beaux_. The companion picture\r\n(1297) is conceived in the same style; but the ladies are here fishing,\r\nthough, to judge from the amateurishness of their proceeding, they are\r\nnot likely to catch fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n1298. LANDSCAPE: RIVER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Joachim Patinir_ (Early Flemish: died 1524). _See 715._\r\n\r\nThis picture, acquired in Florence in 1889 together with two by Zais\r\n(1296, 1297), was for some years attributed to the Venetian school.\r\nIt is now recognised as a work of Patinir. The heavy blue tone of\r\nthat painter's distances here gives way to a lighter colour; but the\r\nfantastic landscape has strong resemblances to No. 716. If by Patinir,\r\nthe work is unique in being one of pure landscape, with no scriptural\r\nincident. \"The earliest independent landscape that we possess by an old\r\nmaster, the first admission that inanimate nature pure and simple is\r\nworth making a picture of. In the left corner is the artist sketching,\r\nwhich is a sort of guarantee that he worked in the open air, and that\r\nhe had been struck with the beauty of some such prospect.... He has\r\nbeen so used to regard landscape as an accessory that he does not dare\r\nto paint it except from a distance, or on any but a minute scale,\r\nand he enlivens it with signs of human industry in the raft and the\r\nlimekiln. It is as though a landscape had stepped out of the background\r\nof some old picture, and asserted its independence with fear and\r\ntrembling\" (Monkhouse: _In the National Gallery_, p. 202).\r\n\r\n\r\n1299. PORTRAIT OF A YOUTH.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Ghirlandajo_ (Florentine: 1449-1494). _See 1230._\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare this portrait with Botticelli's of\r\na somewhat similar subject (No. 626). Both were probably \"good\r\nlikenesses\"; but Ghirlandajo's is less forcible and impressive than\r\nBotticelli's.\r\n\r\n\r\n1300. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Milanese School: 15th-16th Century).\r\n\r\nApparently by a follower of Leonardo.\r\n\r\n\r\n1301. PORTRAIT OF SAVONAROLA.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Florentine: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nA portrait of the great patriot-priest of Florence (1452-1498), whose\r\nstrange career is familiar to all readers of George Eliot's _Romola_.\r\nUltimately he was condemned to death, with his two disciples; and on\r\nthe back of the portrait is a representation of their execution. They\r\nwere hung on a cross, and burnt.\r\n\r\n\r\n1302. THE SOUL OF ST. BERTIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1303. A CHOIR OF ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Simon Marmion_ (French: 1425-1489).\r\n\r\nThese two panels are the uppermost portions of an altar-screen\r\npainted for the Abbey Church of St. Bertin at St. Omer. The remaining\r\nportions are now in the King's Palace at the Hague. These shutters,\r\nand a diptych belonging to the Duc d'Aumale, are the only works that\r\nhave come down to us of Marmion, a painter of Valenciennes, worthy\r\n(according to the chroniclers of his time) of great admiration. The two\r\npanels before us had been reposing for thirty years in a lumber-room at\r\nthe South Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n1304. MARCUS CURTIUS.\r\n\r\n  Unknown (_Umbrian School_: 16th Century).\r\n\r\n      So described in the Official Catalogue. By Signor Frizzoni\r\n      the picture is considered to be of the Florentine school,\r\n      and is ascribed to Francesco Ubertini, for whom see No. 1218\r\n      (_Archivio Storico dell' Arte_, 1895, p. 104).\r\n\r\nThe subject is supposed to be that of the Roman youth who sacrificed\r\nhimself by leaping into a chasm which (said the oracle) would never\r\nclose until Rome threw into it the most precious thing she had. What\r\ndid Rome possess more precious than her arms and courage, said Curtius\r\nas he prepared to leap, in full armour, into the gulf. If this be\r\nthe subject here represented, the picture shows in an interesting\r\nway the frank anachronism of the early painters, for the local\r\ncolour is certainly not that of the Roman Forum, where Curtius took\r\nhis self-sacrificing leap. The picture bears strong resemblance to\r\nRaphael's earlier manner, as any visitor will see who compares it with\r\nthe \"Vision of a Knight\" (213). \"Michael Field\" has put the sentiment\r\nof the picture into verse in _Sight and Song_:--\r\n\r\n    He comes from yonder castle on the steep,\r\n    No Roman, but a lovely Christian knight,\r\n    With azure vest and florid mantle bright,\r\n    Blown, golden hair and youthful face flushed deep\r\n    For glory in the triumph of the leap.\r\n    Though his mild, amber horse rears back at sight\r\n    Of the red flames, though poised for thrust his right\r\n    Hand grasps a knife, his countenance doth keep\r\n    Soft as Saint Michael's with the devil at bay.\r\n    So sweet it is to cast one's life away\r\n    In the fresh pride and perfume of its breath!\r\n    He smiles to think how soon the cleft will close:\r\n    And see, a sun-brimmed cloud above him throws\r\n    Its white effulgence, as he fares to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n1305. A FAMILY GROUP.\r\n\r\n  _G. Donck_ (Dutch: 17th Century).\r\n\r\n      There are other signed pictures by this little known painter\r\n      in private collections in Vienna. They bear the dates 1627 and\r\n      1635.\r\n\r\nPortraits of Jan van Hensbeeck and his wife, Maria Koeck, with their\r\ninfant child between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n1308. PORTRAIT OF A MAN.\r\n\r\n  _J. B. Martinez del Mazo_ (Spanish: 1610-1687).\r\n\r\n      Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo, the favourite pupil and the\r\n      son-in-law of Velazquez, whom he succeeded in 1661 as painter\r\n      to the Spanish Court. In portraiture Mazo was an imitator\r\n      of the great master; he also painted hunting pieces and\r\n      landscapes. His view of Zaragoza, now in the Madrid Gallery, is\r\n      celebrated.\r\n\r\nA very short thick-set figure; possibly a portrait of one of Philip\r\nIV.'s court dwarfs.\r\n\r\n\r\n1309. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Bernardino Licinio_ (Venetian: painted 1524-1541).\r\n\r\n      The above are the earliest and latest dates on his pictures.\r\n      He was a native of Pordenone, in Friuli; a pupil and relative\r\n      of the better known painter who is called after that place.\r\n      There are two pictures by Bernardino at Hampton Court--\"A Lady\r\n      playing on the virginals,\" of rich though muddy colouring; and\r\n      \"A Family Group\" (dated 1524)--monotonous in composition, but\r\n      brilliant in colour (see Mary Logan's _Guide_, p. 25). He also\r\n      painted altar-pieces, among which one in the Frari at Venice is\r\n      the best.\r\n\r\nA young man with feminine features. His black gown, lined with gray\r\nfur, is left open at the chest and discloses a gold chain and pendant.\r\nOn the stone plinth whereon he leans is an inscription, \"Stephanus\r\nNani. abavro XVII. MDXXVIII·Lycinivs. P.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1310. \"ECCE HOMO!\"\r\n\r\n  _Cima da Conegliano_ (Venetian: 1460-1518). _See 300._\r\n\r\nThis picture was sold as a Carlo Dolci; but the attribution was an\r\nobvious absurdity. There is no resemblance whatever between the\r\naffected sentimentality of Dolci and the sincere pathos of this\r\npicture. Its deep and rich colouring also is very different from\r\nDolci's. Sir Frederick Burton labelled his _trouvaille_ \"Giovanni\r\nBellini.\" But its attribution to Cima is now accepted. \"This type of\r\nChrist,\" says Mr. Claude Phillips, \"of a perfect, manly beauty, of a\r\ndivine meekness tempering majesty, dates back not to Gian Bellino but\r\nto Cima. The preferred type of the elder master is more passionate,\r\nmore human. Our own Incredulity of St. Thomas, by Cima, shows in a\r\nmuch more perfunctory fashion a Christ similarly conceived\" (_The\r\nEarlier Work of Titian_, p. 31 _n._). To the same effect a writer in\r\nthe _Academy_ (July 26, 1890) says: \"The modelling--not precise or\r\nsearching enough for Giambellino--resembles that of his gifted pupil,\r\nthe parted lips being one of his especial characteristics, as may be\r\nnoted in his great 'Incredulity of St Thomas' (816). The treatment\r\nof the heavy wig-like masses of the hair, with its fine lines, is\r\nvery similar to that of the Saviour's parted locks in the larger\r\nwork, while a certain want of flexibility in the muscles of the face\r\nis also a distinguishing mark of the master. More striking still is\r\nthe coincidence that from the head of Christ issue in both instances\r\nsingle rays, disposed in three distinct and separate _fasciculi_--an\r\narrangement not found, as far as we are aware, in the works of Giovanni\r\nBellini, and never common in Italian art. The peculiarly brilliant\r\nblue of the drapery is paralleled by that of the little 'St. Jerome'\r\nfrom the Hamilton Palace Collection, and approached by that of the\r\n'Virgin and Child'--both these panels being sufficiently representative\r\nexamples of Cima. Comparison has in these remarks been restricted to\r\nworks in the National Gallery, as being most readily available for\r\npurposes of verification. The influence of Antonello--from whom Bellini\r\nhimself borrowed so much--is, in the new acquisition, undeniable,\r\nand may account for a virility and an intensity of pathos not often\r\nreached even in the better productions of the sympathetic Bellinesque\r\npainter to whom we would attribute it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1311. A WINTER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Beerestraaten_ (Dutch: 1622-1687).\r\n\r\n      This painter was the son of a cooper of Amsterdam. He travelled\r\n      much in Holland, staying in all the towns he visited, and\r\n      copying their monuments, squares, and thoroughfares, and\r\n      leaving everywhere on his route a great number of sketches and\r\n      pictures. He painted Italian views also, but these pictures may\r\n      have been founded on local sketches by other Dutch artists.\r\n      \"His manner of painting was vigorous; delicate finish and\r\n      precision of touch were less his aim than freedom of handling\r\n      combined with broad contrasts of tone, where the colour, of a\r\n      subdued richness, shows brilliancy and often loses itself in\r\n      harmonies of gray\" (_Official Catalogue_, and Havard's _Dutch\r\n      School_, p. 239).\r\n\r\nThe castle is that of Muiden, between Amsterdam and Naarden. The\r\nfortified village is in the distance. On the left is the Zuyder Zee.\r\nSigned in the foreground, and dated 1658.\r\n\r\n\r\n1312. THE VILLAGE COBBLER.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Victoors_ (Dutch: 1620-1672).\r\n\r\n      Victoors, a native of Amsterdam, was a pupil of Rembrandt,\r\n      and attempted biblical subjects in the style of his master; a\r\n      picture by him in this kind may be seen in the Dulwich Gallery.\r\n      But he is seen at his best in portraits and domestic subjects,\r\n      such as that treated in the present picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n1313. THE ORIGIN OF \"THE MILKY WAY.\"\r\n\r\n  _Tintoretto_ (Venetian: 1518-1594). _See 16._\r\n\r\nThis work, acquired from the Earl of Darnley, is a particularly welcome\r\naddition to the National Gallery; for the two works by Tintoret\r\npreviously in the collection,--the \"St. George and the Dragon\" and\r\n\"Christ Washing the Disciples' Feet,\"--though fairly representative of\r\nhis more sombre mood, give no idea whatever of such radiant forms and\r\nsweeping harmonies as those with which he decorated the Ducal Palace\r\nat Venice. This picture immediately recalls these last-mentioned\r\nworks, for it was doubtless designed as the centre-piece for some\r\npainted ceiling. The picture is a very beautiful representation of a\r\nclassic myth of the Milky Way. Hermes, it is told, carried the infant\r\nHercules to Olympus, and put him to the breast of Juno while she lay\r\nasleep; but, as she awoke, she pushed the child from her, and the milk\r\nthus spilled produced the Milky Way. In this picture, however, we see\r\nJupiter himself descending through the air and bearing the child in\r\nhis arms. Juno is rising undraped from her couch, surrounded by little\r\nloves, and attended by peacocks--emblems of her royal state as Queen\r\nof Heaven; while in the deep-blue firmament is the eagle carrying the\r\nthunderbolt of Jupiter. From her bosom issue long lacteal jets that\r\nseem, as it were, to crystallise into stars. Sumptuous draperies float\r\naround the ground, and in most poetical composition Tintoret has thus\r\n\"mingled with their gorgeous dyes The milky baldric of the skies.\"\r\nThere is a study for the picture in the Accademia at Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n1314. THE AMBASSADORS.\r\n\r\n  _Hans Holbein, the Younger_ (German: 1497-1543).\r\n\r\n      Hans Holbein--\"the greatest master,\" says Ruskin, \"of the\r\n      German, or any northern school\"--is closely identified with\r\n      England, and at least seventy important works by him are, it\r\n      is calculated, in this country. He is called \"the younger,\" to\r\n      distinguish him from his father of the same name, who was also\r\n      a celebrated painter.[238] The son was born at Augsburg, but\r\n      migrated early in life to Basle--then a centre of literary and\r\n      artistic activity. There he formed a friendship with Erasmus,\r\n      a portrait of whom from his hand is now one of the treasures\r\n      of the Basle Museum. Both at Basle and at Lucerne Holbein was\r\n      engaged in portraiture, house-decorating, and designs for\r\n      goldsmiths' work. Ruskin traces to Holbein's surroundings at\r\n      Basle the serious temper which characterises much of his art.\r\n      \"A grave man, knowing what steps of men keep truest time to the\r\n      chanting of Death. Having grave friends also;--the same singing\r\n      heard far off, it seems to me, or, perhaps even low in the\r\n      room, by that family of Sir Thomas More; or mingling with the\r\n      hum of bees in the meadows outside the towered wall of Basle;\r\n      or making the words of the book more tuneable, which meditative\r\n      Erasmus looks upon. Nay, that same soft death-music is on the\r\n      lips even of Holbein's Madonna.\" The reference here is to the\r\n      famous \"Darmstadt Madonna,\" which was painted about 1526. In\r\n      that year, leaving his wife and child behind him, Holbein set\r\n      out for England, with letters from Erasmus to Sir Thomas More,\r\n      who received him with honour. From 1528 to 1532 he was again\r\n      in Basle. In the latter year he returned to England to find\r\n      More in disgrace, and no longer able to assist him. Holbein,\r\n      however, met with a warm reception from the German merchants\r\n      of the Steelyard, and painted portraits of many of them. To\r\n      this same period also the present picture belongs. Gradually\r\n      he became known at court, and from 1536 onwards he was in\r\n      the service of Henry VIII., whose high opinion of Holbein is\r\n      recorded in the King's rebuke to one of his courtiers for\r\n      insulting the painter: \"You have not to do with Holbein, but\r\n      with me; and I tell you that of seven peasants I can make seven\r\n      lords, but not one Holbein.\" The portrait of Christina of\r\n      Denmark, lent by the Duke of Norfolk, was one of those painted\r\n      for the King. He paid during these years several visits to the\r\n      Continent, but died in this country--being carried off by the\r\n      plague--in 1543.\r\n\r\n      It is as a portrait-painter that Holbein is best known.\r\n      His work in this kind is, says Ruskin, \"true and thorough;\r\n      accomplished in the highest as the most literary sense, with\r\n      a calm entireness of unaffected resolution, which sacrifices\r\n      nothing, forgets nothing, and fears nothing.\" Of his fidelity\r\n      in portraiture and his fine perfection in accessories, we\r\n      have a magnificent example in the picture before us, to which\r\n      what Ruskin says of Holbein's \"George Gyzen\" (at Berlin)\r\n      equally applies. \"In some qualities of force and grace it is\r\n      inferior. But it is inexhaustible. Every detail of it wins,\r\n      retains, rewards the attention with a continually increasing\r\n      sense of wonderfulness. So far as it reaches, it contains the\r\n      absolute facts of colour, form, and character rendered with\r\n      an inaccessible faithfulness. There is no question respecting\r\n      things which it is best worth while to know, or things which\r\n      it is unnecessary to state, or which might be overlooked with\r\n      advantage. What were visible to Holbein, are visible to us;\r\n      we may despise if we will; deny or doubt, we shall not; if we\r\n      care to know anything concerning them, great or small, so much\r\n      as may by the eye be known is for ever knowable, reliable, and\r\n      indisputable.\" But Holbein, as we have seen, was much more than\r\n      a portrait-painter. Few artists, indeed, have excelled him\r\n      in \"majestic range of capacity.\" His \"Madonna\" at Darmstadt,\r\n      referred to above (the better known copy of which is at\r\n      Dresden), is one of the great religious pictures of the world.\r\n      (A copy of it is in the Arundel Society's Collection.) He was\r\n      also a fresco-painter, a designer for glass painting, and a\r\n      draughtsman for woodcuts; his designs for the \"Dance of Death\"\r\n      being the typical expression in Northern art of the spirit of\r\n      the Reformation. (For Ruskin's estimate of Holbein, see further\r\n      _Sir Joshua & Holbein_, reprinted in _On the Old Road_, vol.\r\n      i., and _Ariadne Florentina_, _passim_.)\r\n\r\nThis celebrated picture is, says Mr. Sidney Colvin, the most important\r\namong Holbein's works--after the Darmstadt Madonna--that are extant in\r\ngood preservation, important alike as to scale, and as to richness\r\nand multiplicity of accessories and costumes. It is also one of those\r\nmost characteristic of the master, both in his excellences and in\r\nhis faults. \"There are more completely satisfying works among his\r\nsingle-figure portraits, in some of which we find a greater artistic\r\nunity--as, for instance, in the portrait of 'Christina, Duchess of\r\nMilan.' Among the faults in the present work may be noticed the\r\nshort proportions of the figures in relation to the heads--an effect\r\nexaggerated in the case of the personage on our left by the fashion\r\nof the broad surcoat with its great puffed sleeves. It must further\r\nbe admitted that Holbein, who in decorative and ornamental design was\r\none of the most inventive, adroit, and powerful composers that ever\r\nlived, has in this instance seemed to let his composition take care of\r\nitself.[239] The figures are placed at either end of the desk, with a\r\ncertain _naïf_ stiffness almost recalling the pose of a photographic\r\ngroup. Moreover, masterly and energetic as are the heads in modelling,\r\nin expression they are somewhat rigid, harsh, and staring. Yet, all\r\ndeductions made, with what an effective and potent grasp does the\r\npicture hold us! The colouring is richer and more varied than in\r\nany other painting of the master.\" The accessories are painted with\r\n\"such strong minuteness of reality and diligent, though never paltry,\r\nemphasis of detail, that their due subordination to the whole and to\r\nthe personages would seem impossible. But the subordination is there\r\nall the same, and how it comes is Holbein's secret. The total effect is\r\none of singularly rich, if somewhat rigid grandeur;[240] the persons\r\ndominating as they should; the faces and hands remaining the master\r\nfeatures of the picture. The heads, with their hard gaze, lay hold\r\non the spectator masterfully, so that he cannot forget them after he\r\nhas passed away\" (_Art Journal_, January 1890). The brilliance of the\r\npicture, now that the discoloured varnish which formerly concealed many\r\nof its beauties has been removed, is very remarkable.[241] Every colour\r\nappears to have stood; and after 370 years the picture remains in its\r\npristine freshness.\r\n\r\nThe identity of the personages portrayed in the picture had long\r\nbeen a subject for critical conjecture among the ingenious. The\r\npicture was traditionally known as \"The Ambassadors,\" and the name\r\nof almost every ambassador of the period had at one time or another\r\nbeen suggested; while other critics, maintaining that the traditional\r\ntitle rested on no good authority, went further afield and sought\r\nto identify the personages with various poets and men of letters,\r\nto whom the accessories in the picture seemed appropriate.[242] The\r\nmatter has now, however, been finally set at rest by the discovery\r\nof a seventeenth-century manuscript, which gives a description of\r\nthe picture and records its history during the first 120 years of\r\nits existence.[243] This manuscript, presented by Miss Mary Hervey\r\n(who discovered it), is now hung in another part of the Gallery (in\r\nthe small room marked A on our plan). The traditional title of the\r\npicture is confirmed, for the portraits are of Jean de Dinteville (on\r\nthe left), French Ambassador in England, and George de Selve (on the\r\nright), Bishop of Lavaur, and subsequently Ambassador at Venice. The\r\ntwo men, we learn from the MS., were friends; and in 1533, the year\r\nin which the picture was painted, George de Selve came to England,\r\nby permission of the French king, on a visit to Jean de Dinteville:\r\n\"and the two, having there met with an excellent painter of Holland,\r\nemployed him to make this picture, which has been carefully preserved\r\nin the same place at Polizy up to the year 1653.\"\r\n\r\nThe document itself is convincing, and its identification of the\r\npersonages agrees with what may be learnt from an examination of the\r\npicture. There are three inscriptions on it. One is on the sheath\r\nof the dagger which hangs from the girdle of the personage on the\r\nspectator's left. This inscription is: \"ÆT. SVÆ 29.\" On the edges of\r\na clasped book, upon which the second personage leans, is another\r\ninscription: \"ÆTATIS SVÆ 25.\" Thirdly, in the shadow cast on the floor\r\nby the chief personage is the inscription: \"IOHANNES HOLBEIN PINGEBAT,\r\n1533.\" Jean de Dinteville, Seigneur of Polizy, Bailly of Troyes,\r\nChevalier de l'Ordre du Roi,--the order of St. Michael, which he wears\r\nin the picture,--was born September 21, 1504, and was, therefore, in\r\nhis 29th year, or just the age required by the picture, at the time\r\nof his first Embassy to England in 1533. He remained in this country\r\nfrom February to November of that year, returning again as Ambassador\r\nin 1536. At a later period of his life he became paralysed and retired\r\nto his estate at Polizy, where he occupied the enforced leisure of his\r\nill-health in building and embellishing the château, of which a vaulted\r\nundercroft and a few other striking fragments, including an inscription\r\nand some dates, yet remain as a monument to his tastes. He died in\r\n1555. On the globe, which stands on the lower shelf of the what-not,\r\nthe names are all of continents, countries, or great cities,--Paris,\r\nLyons, Bayonne, Genoa, Rome, Nuremberg,--with the single exception\r\nthat, in the east of France, we find the name of what is little more\r\nthan a village. This name is Polizy.\r\n\r\nGeorge de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur, was one of six brothers, nearly all\r\nof whom attained distinction as Ambassadors. In 1526, at the early\r\nage of 18, he was appointed to the See of Lavaur, but he was not\r\nconsecrated until 1534, when he was 26. It follows from these dates\r\nthat in 1533, the year in which he sat to Holbein, he was 25 years old,\r\nor precisely of the age recorded in the picture. His non-episcopal\r\ndress is explained by the fact that he was only consecrated in the\r\nfollowing year, the same in which he was appointed Ambassador at\r\nVenice. In 1536 he was transferred to Rome, where he remained two\r\nyears, and in 1540 we find him intrusted with an important mission\r\nto Charles V. Having voluntarily returned to his diocese when at the\r\nzenith of his career, in order to devote himself completely to his\r\nepiscopal duties, he died in 1542 (N.S.) at the early age of 34. His\r\nprofound learning, his piety, his keen interest in all intellectual\r\npursuits, make him one of the remarkable figures of his day.\r\n\r\nSome further description of the details may assist the spectator in his\r\nexamination of the picture. The background is hung with green damask,\r\nwhich in the upper left-hand corner reveals a silver crucifix. Jean de\r\nDinteville, the figure on the left, habited in the rich costume of the\r\nperiod of Henry VIII. and Francis I., wears a heavy gold chain with the\r\nbadge (as already explained) of the French Order of St. Michael. In his\r\nright hand he holds a richly-chased gold dagger, \"the design of which\r\nis manifestly Holbein's own; and beside it hangs a large green and gold\r\nsilk tassel, in itself a miracle of painting.\" In his black bonnet is\r\na jewel formed of a silver skull set in gold. The other personage is\r\nmore soberly attired. He wears a loose, long-sleeved gown of mulberry\r\nand black brocade, lined with sable, and the four-cornered black cap,\r\n\"which was in that age the common headgear of scholars, university\r\ndoctors, and ecclesiastics in undress.\" \"The contrast between the\r\nswordsman on one side and the gownsman on the other is characteristic\r\nof the era and profession of the two ambassadors.\" The upper shelf\r\nof the stand, or what-not, between the two figures is covered with\r\na Turkish rug, very beautifully painted, and on this are several\r\nmathematical and astronomical instruments, and, close to the principal\r\npersonage, a celestial globe. Conspicuous on the lower shelf is a lute,\r\nof which one of the strings was broken and curled up over the unbroken\r\none. On the lower shelf also are a case of flutes; an open music-book,\r\ncontaining part of the score and words of the Lutheran hymn, \"Komm,\r\nheiliger Geist\";[245] a smaller book on arithmetic, kept partly open by\r\na small square, a pair of compasses, and a terrestrial hand-globe (in\r\ndirect line below the other globe). On this globe the famous line drawn\r\nby Pope Alexander VI. in 1493 between the spheres of influence of Spain\r\nand Portugal is marked. Underneath the what-not is the lute-case; and\r\na fine mosaic adorns the floor. The design of this is (as Miss Hervey\r\npoints out) an accurate copy of the well-known mosaic pavement in the\r\nSanctuary of Westminster Abbey, for the construction of which marbles\r\nand workmen were brought from Italy by Abbot Richard Ware in the reign\r\nof Henry III. \"Nothing brings the English sojourn of the great painter\r\nmore closely home to us than to fancy him wandering through the aisles\r\nof the venerable Abbey--venerable even then--to sketch the outlines of\r\nthe historic pavement trodden by so many generations before and since\r\nthat time.\"\r\n\r\nOn the floor is a mysterious-looking object, which puzzled the\r\nconnoisseurs for centuries. Even the late Mr. Wornum could make\r\nnothing of it; and in his book on Holbein (1867) dismissed it as \"a\r\nsingular object which looks like the bones of some fish.\" The puzzle\r\nwas first solved by Dr. Woodward in 1873, when the picture was hung in\r\nthe \"Old Masters\" Exhibition. The curious fish-like object is simply\r\nthe anamorphosis--the distorted projection--of a human skull. It was\r\nprobably drawn from the reflection in a cylindrical mirror; and it\r\nis seen to be an accurate representation when viewed from the proper\r\npoint. If the spectator cannot discover this for himself, the attendant\r\nwill readily assist him. One must stand at a little distance off and\r\nlook in the direction of the length of the object from the right hand\r\nin order to \"find the skull.\" Pictorial puzzles such as the skull were\r\nat the time not uncommon. Allusions to such things are to be found in\r\nold inventories of pictures; and Shakespeare in _Richard II._ says:\r\n\r\n    Like pérspectives, which, _rightly_ gazed upon,\r\n    Show nothing but confusion: eyed _awry_\r\n    Distinguish form.--Act II. Sc. 2.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Canon Ainger has pointed out that in _Twelfth Night_, when\r\nthe Duke first becomes aware that Viola and Sebastian, who had up to\r\nthat time from their exact likeness been thought the same person, are\r\nreally two, he cries out that here is a puzzle in nature corresponding\r\nto those in art, where an object varies according to the point of view\r\nfrom which it is regarded:\r\n\r\n    A natural perspective--that is and is not!\r\n\r\nAs to the interpretation and significance of the puzzle, authorities\r\ndiffer. Some see in the skull only a punning signature of the painter's\r\nname (_hohl bein_, hollow bone, holbein). Others discover in it a\r\nrecondite allusion to Cranmer (crâne-mère). Others again, when the\r\nidentity of the personages was still in dispute, sought to connect\r\nthe skull with the death of one or other of them; most ingenious and\r\nfar-fetched theories were elaborated by Sir F. Burton and others with\r\nthis object. Probably, however, the distorted skull is only a variant\r\non the _memento mori_, which occurs very frequently in portraits of the\r\ntime (see, for instance, No. 1036). It may be (as Miss Hervey suggests)\r\nthat Dinteville had adopted the death's-head as his personal badge or\r\n_devise_. He suffered from ill-health, and in a letter to his brother\r\ndescribes himself as \"the most melancholy ambassador that ever was\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nThere is still a field open to conjecture with regard to the elaborate\r\naccessories described above. Mr. Sidney Colvin thinks, indeed, that\r\nthe globes, quadrant, music-book, etc., are probably simply introduced\r\nby the painter to show his skill of hand for the satisfaction of his\r\npatrons, the choice of objects having been made partly in compliment\r\nto them as persons interested in music and the sciences, partly because\r\nthey were the properties readiest to hand in the society of such men\r\nas Kratzer, the astronomer, and the German merchant goldsmiths of the\r\nSteelyard, among whom Holbein lived (_Times_, Dec. 10, 1895). Miss\r\nHervey sees in the accessories \"a record, probably unique in the domain\r\nof art, of the thoughts and studies, the hopes and fears, which swayed\r\nthe country and generation of Jean de Dinteville. The objects selected\r\nfor illustration precisely represent the pursuits and occupations most\r\nin vogue at the time in France. Geometry and Mechanics, the foundations\r\nof the builder's art, just then attaining classical expression in the\r\nlovely creations of the French Renaissance; Music, especially that of\r\nthe lute, which was so fashionable that every Frenchman of exalted\r\nposition carried a lutist in his train; the ingeniously contrived and\r\nartistically rendered _devise_; these, as the literature of the period\r\nabundantly testifies, were among the favourite studies and pastimes\r\nof the Court of France.\" Dinteville \"must have devoted many an hour\r\nto thinking out with the painter the elaborate details.\" A different\r\ncontention has been argued with much ability by Mr. Alfred Marks:--\r\n\r\n      The scheme of the picture is very unusual. At either end of a\r\n      table of two stages stands a figure in a ceremonious attitude.\r\n      Between these figures, the two stages of the table, occupying\r\n      the middle and most prominent portion of the picture, are\r\n      loaded with numerous accessories. The method of their display\r\n      forbids us to suppose that, as suggested by Mr. Colvin,\r\n      they are here merely to show the painter's skill of hand.\r\n      Indeed, the whole scheme of the picture--pose of figures and\r\n      arrangement of accessories--tells of some occasion which the\r\n      picture is designed to commemorate, or, let us say, perhaps,\r\n      some occasion of which advantage has been taken to place the\r\n      personages in a situation of more than ordinary interest. What\r\n      this occasion was the picture, as we shall find, declares\r\n      with sufficient plainness. Holbein's symbolism was simple\r\n      and direct. Does he desire to convey that his sitter is a\r\n      merchant? The figure is represented as holding a bond; other\r\n      bonds lie on a table, together with a seal and a pen. Or, if he\r\n      is portraying an astronomer, he introduces a quadrant, dials,\r\n      compasses, and other instruments of the craft. In the \"Two\r\n      Ambassadors\" the symbolism is, from the nature of the case,\r\n      not personal to each of the two figures, but applicable to the\r\n      occasion. The lute, instrument of harmony, was already, as has\r\n      been shown by Mr. Dickes [see _Magazine of Art_, December 1891\r\n      and June 1892], the accepted symbol of a treaty; the suggestion\r\n      is strengthened by the introduction of a case of flutes. The\r\n      occasion commemorated is, therefore, a treaty. Nor are we left\r\n      in doubt as to the nature of this treaty; the globes celestial\r\n      and terrestrial, the compasses, dials, quadrants, merchants'\r\n      calculating book, clearly indicate that the treaty was one\r\n      relating to commerce or navigation.\r\n\r\nMr. Marks discovers in support of his theory that in 1533 (the date of\r\nthe picture) some agreement was arrived at between King Henry VIII.\r\nand the French Ambassador with regard to certain grievances of French\r\nmerchants. George de Selve, as we have seen, came over to England with\r\nthe French King's permission and assisted Dinteville, it is suggested,\r\nin the arrangement, the conclusion of which is celebrated by Holbein's\r\npicture (_Times_, Dec. 7, 12, 23, 1895).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _provenance_ of the picture, in the year 1653 it\r\nwas still, as we have seen, at the château of Polizy. The next known\r\nnotices of it occur in a Rouen catalogue of 1787, and in the _Galerie\r\ndes Peintres_ (1792) of J. R. P. Lebrun (husband of the artist\r\nVigée-Lebrun), who had the picture in his possession, and states that\r\nhe had sold it, and that it was then in England. It seems probable that\r\nit came into the hands of the dealer Vandergutsch, and that from him it\r\nwas purchased by the second Earl of Radnor about 1808 or 1809, in whose\r\nfamily it became an heirloom. In 1891 it was purchased from the present\r\nearl for the nation.[246]\r\n\r\n\r\n1315. THE ADMIRAL PULIDO PAREJA.\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish: 1599-1660). _See 197._\r\n\r\nOne of the master's most famous works. \"In the year 1639,\" says\r\nPalomino, \"he made the picture of Don Adrian Pulido Pareja, a native\r\nof Madrid, Knight of the Order of Santiago, Admiral of the Fleet of\r\nNew Spain, who about that time was here transacting various official\r\nmatters with His Majesty. This portrait is life size, and is among the\r\nmost famous painted by Velazquez, on which account he put his name to\r\nit, which he otherwise seldom did: _Didacus Velazquez fecit; Philip IV.\r\nà cubiculo eiusque Pictor, anno 1639_.\" The painter's signature was not\r\nthe only thing which served at the time to stamp the picture as one of\r\nspecial excellence. The King one day was paying his customary visit\r\nto the painter; Philip mistook the picture for the admiral himself,\r\nand rebuked him for tarrying in Madrid when he had been ordered away.\r\nPerceiving his mistake, he addressed Velazquez with the words: 'I\r\nassure you I was deceived.' \"This, of course,\" says Mr. Colvin, \"is one\r\nof the common legends which abound in the art history of all countries,\r\nfrom Greece to Japan; but it is almost possible to believe the tale\r\nwhen we look at the picture. Something of the rugged flashing power and\r\nfierce eagerness of the sitter seems to have passed into the painter's\r\nhand, and the method of execution he has chosen emphasises and\r\nharmonises with the character of the subject. The rude soldier-sailor\r\nin his handsome suit stands in bodily and spiritual presence before us,\r\nand seems snorting with impatience to be off to the fight once more.\"\r\n\r\nPulido, the subject of the picture, was a captain who distinguished\r\nhimself greatly during the siege of Fontarabia, in the war with France.\r\n\"The browned face with gleams of white light belongs,\" says Professor\r\nJusti, in describing the picture, \"to a not uncommon Castilian type,\r\nof which this is an exceptionally stout, sturdy, grim specimen. The\r\nthick black shady eyebrows, very bushy and nearly meeting above the\r\nnose, the perpendicular wrinkle right in the middle of the forehead,\r\nthe up-twirled mustachio,--the whole enframed in an abundant mass\r\nof black hair parted on one side and profusely crowning the defiant\r\nhead,--bespeak the dauntless soldier as he stood on the ramparts of\r\nFontarabia, as he will yet stand on the quarter-deck of the Admiral's\r\nship in the hottest of the fight. There is nothing of the courtier in\r\nthe attitude, for he stands bolt upright, like a soldier before his\r\ncommanding officer. We see at once that he is not the man to hesitate\r\nabout risking his own life or that of others in the deadly jaws of a\r\nbreach. Both hands wear the yellow leather gloves, the right holding\r\nthe Admiral's staff, the left a very broad-brimmed felt hat. On his\r\nbreast is the red, gold-hemmed scarf and the red enamelled decoration\r\nof the Order of Santiago\"--which the King had bestowed upon him for his\r\ngallantry in the siege.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _technique_ of the picture, Palomino tells us that\r\nVelazquez painted it with brushes of unusual length, in order to work\r\nwith greater force and effect standing at a distance. \"It appears in\r\nfact (says Professor Justi) to have been very broadly treated, with\r\nmore fiery vigour than delicacy. The light yellow-gray ground--dark\r\nabove, and without any relation to the limits of wall and floor--has\r\nbeen specially prepared with reference to the black velvet costume.\r\nDon Adrian stands a little to the left, his glance directed towards\r\nthe observer, legs[247] brought close together, feet almost at a right\r\nangle. The colour is applied more freely than usual, the otherwise\r\nrarely employed dazzling white patches on the deep lace collar,\r\nflowered satin sleeves, plumes, bows on the knees, and accoutrements,\r\nhelping the illusion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1316. AN ITALIAN NOBLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Moroni_ (Bergamese: 1525-1578). _See 697._\r\n\r\nInferior in charm and interest to some of the other Moronis previously\r\nin the National Gallery, and to many of the master's marvellous\r\npictures in the Carrara Collection at Bergamo. \"Only,\" says a recent\r\ncritic, \"in the expressive look in the dreamy eyes, and in the drawing\r\nand painting of the left arm, clothed in chain-armour, do we find\r\ninterest.\" Another, and more favourable, critic (Mr. Sidney Colvin)\r\nsays: \"Dignity and directness of presentment, richness of quality\r\nand mellowness of tone, with a colour-sense never more powerfully\r\nshown than when the scheme is one of flesh-colour with simple black\r\nand white on gray--these are the universal qualities of Venetian\r\nportrait-painting.... This is a thoroughly characteristic example in\r\nan excellent state. We already possess a portrait by the same hand,\r\ncomposed of much the same elements (1022): a man in a close-fitting\r\nblack suit, showing chain-armour on the sleeves, a broken column, a\r\nwall, and a glimpse of sky. The two will make admirable pendants.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1317. THE MARRIAGE OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Sienese School: 14th or early 15th Century).\r\n\r\nThis is one of the stock subjects in which the evolution of Italian\r\nart may be most clearly traced. Everybody knows the beautiful and\r\ncelebrated \"Sposalizio\" of Raphael at Milan, which in its turn was\r\ncopied, with some characteristic modifications, from Perugino's\r\npicture, now at Caen. Comparing those versions of the subject with an\r\nearly one such as this, every one will be struck by the difference in\r\ngeneral effect, but not less remarkable are the resemblances. The type,\r\nso far as the component parts are concerned, remains constant. The\r\nbasis of the tale which Italian painters told for century after century\r\nis found in two of the apocryphal gospels. In them we read how the\r\n\"Virgin of the Lord\" was brought up, like Samuel, within the precincts\r\nof the temple, and how the High Priest summoned the suitors to an\r\nordeal. Every man of them was to take a rod, and he whose rod should\r\nmiraculously put forth leaves and blossom was to be chosen as husband.\r\nThe common features of all \"Sposalizio\" pictures adhere closely to this\r\nlegend. Thus the action always takes place within or just outside the\r\ntemple. In the centre stands the High Priest with a long gray beard and\r\n(almost always) a high-peaked mitre, the Italian painters' idea of a\r\nJewish ephod. He joins the hands of the pair in betrothal. The rod of\r\nJoseph blossoms, and above its foliage hovers the Holy Spirit in the\r\nform of a dove. One of the suitors is about to strike Joseph in his\r\npassion; another is engaged in breaking his rod in vexation. Raphael\r\nmakes the mien of the suitors much more gentle. He leaves out \"the\r\npassionate suitor\" altogether, but gives to the \"disappointed suitor\"\r\na prominent place as an opportunity for a graceful attitude. In this\r\npicture he is very much in the background (in the extreme left-hand\r\ncorner).\r\n\r\n\r\n1318. \"UNFAITHFULNESS.\"\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Veronese_ (Veronese: 1528-1588). _See 26._\r\n\r\nOne of a series: see under 1324-26.\r\n\r\n\r\n1319. VIEW IN ROME.\r\n\r\n  _Claude_ (French: 1600-1682). _See 2._\r\n\r\nOn the right of the composition are an ancient Ionic portico (seen from\r\nthe side) and a statue of Apollo, surrounded by trees. On the left is a\r\nwooded slope, beyond which, in the middle distance, is seen the church\r\nof Sta. Trinita de' Monti with other buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n1320, 1321. A MAN AND HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelis Janssens_ (Dutch: 1594-1664).\r\n\r\n      This painter--Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen--is believed to have\r\n      been born in London. He was taken into the service of James\r\n      I., whose portrait he painted several times. In the National\r\n      Portrait Gallery are portraits by him of Sir Edward Coke and\r\n      Lord Coventry. His reputation waned somewhat after the arrival\r\n      of Van Dyck, whose portrait he painted and whose influence\r\n      may be noticed in the pictures now before us. In the Dulwich\r\n      Gallery are two pictures formerly ascribed to Van Dyck, but\r\n      now to Janssens. In 1648 \"Cornelius Johnson, picture-drawer\"\r\n      was permitted by the Speaker's warrant to pass beyond seas\r\n      with such goods and chattels as belonged to himself. On his\r\n      return to Holland, he seems to have worked at Middelburg,\r\n      at the Hague, and at Amsterdam. Pictures by him may be seen\r\n      in all those places. His portraits are sometimes stiff in\r\n      conception, but are remarkable for the \"lively tranquillity of\r\n      the countenances.\" None of the artists excelled him in painting\r\n      the lace collars and cuffs which were the reigning fashion of\r\n      the time.\r\n\r\nThe man is Aglonius Voon; the woman (presumably his wife), Cornelia\r\nRemoens: the names are inscribed above their heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n1323. PIERO DI MEDICI.\r\n\r\n  _Angelo Bronzino_ (Florentine: 1502-1572). _See 649._\r\n\r\nA portrait of Piero, son of Cosimo the elder--surnamed \"Il Gottoso,\"\r\nThe Gouty--who died in 1469. Bronzino was employed to paint the\r\nportraits of many members of the Medici family. No. 704 is a\r\ncontemporary portrait of one of the later Dukes.\r\n\r\n\r\n1324. \"SCORN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1325. \"RESPECT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1326. \"HAPPY UNION.\"\r\n\r\n  _Paolo Veronese_ (Veronese: 1528-1588). _See 26._\r\n\r\nThe four Veroneses (1325, 1324, 1318, and 1326), acquired from\r\nCobham Hall, \"obviously formed a series, or portions of a series,\r\nof enrichments for a ceiling, and must be looked at accordingly.\r\nThey exhibit the decorative power of Veronese at a very high\r\npitch in respect to colour, composition, and action, while his\r\ncharacteristically large and bold style of design and draughtsmanship\r\nare most fortunately employed upon them. One may readily conceive\r\nthe magnificence of the saloon for which they were executed, and of\r\nwhich they must have been the chief ornaments. Sumptuous as they are\r\nnow, their superb qualities would be enhanced if they could be seen\r\nwith all their original accompaniments of gilding, carved frames, and\r\nmagnificent furniture\" (_Athenæum_, August 16, 1890).\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the pictures are moral allegories, and they go in\r\npairs. Thus we have first \"Respect\" (1325) and \"Scorn\" (1324). In the\r\nformer picture, a nude female figure--whose beautiful face recalls\r\nthat of the \"St. Helena\" (see No. 1041)--is seen recumbent on a couch,\r\nasleep or lost in dreams. Cupid is leading a warrior, clad in sumptuous\r\ncostume, but he turns aside, held back by an older man, in chivalrous\r\n_respect_. He is contrasted in the companion picture with another male\r\nfigure, who lies prostrate while a Cupid tramples in _scorn_ upon him.\r\nOn the left two females (contrasting with the two men in the former\r\npictures) are hurrying away. The elder carries an ermine, the emblem of\r\npurity, and guides the younger and more beautiful woman whom she has\r\nrescued from peril.\r\n\r\nIn the other two pictures the faithfulness and unfaithfulness of woman\r\nare similarly contrasted. In \"Unfaithfulness\" (1318) a nude female\r\nfigure, seated on a bank with her back turned to the spectator, extends\r\nher arm towards a man who grasps her right hand, while she with her\r\nleft is employed in furtively delivering a letter to a more youthful\r\nlover on the other side. He is of the same type as the figure of\r\nAlexander in the Family of Darius (294). Finally, in \"Happy Union\"\r\n(1326) the painter shows us the reward of faithfulness. Here a Cupid\r\nis introducing a warrior to a queenly figure--whom we may take to\r\npersonify Fame or Fortune--seated on a globe at the entrance to some\r\npalace. She is placing a wreath upon the man's brow; he is led by a\r\nbeautiful woman who carries a palm which she is about to present to\r\nhim. She in her turn is guided by a little Love who has hold of a\r\ngolden chain around her waist. A dog is also in attendance. It is a\r\npretty trait of the Venetian schools, the frequency with which a pet\r\ndog is introduced into scenes of domestic felicity.\r\n\r\nThe prices paid for these pictures are interesting. They belonged at\r\none time to Queen Christina of Sweden, and afterwards passed into\r\nthe Orleans Collection. At the sale of that collection, the Tintoret\r\nfetched £50, and the four Veroneses £198. Lord Darnley made a handsome\r\n\"unearned increment\" out of them. For the Tintoret and one of the\r\nVeroneses (1318) the nation paid £2500. For two more of the Veroneses\r\nthe same price was paid. The fourth Veronese (1325) was presented by\r\nLord Darnley.\r\n\r\n\r\n1327. A WINTER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Goyen_ (Dutch: 1596-1656). _See 137._\r\n\r\nThe scene is an arm of the Maes, near Dordrecht; the ice being covered\r\nwith skaters, hockey-players, and others. The figures are treated with\r\nconsiderable humour. In the distance rises the tall ruin, which is\r\nshown in so many of Cuyp's pictures. Van Goyen's signature and the date\r\n1642 are conspicuous on a sleigh in the foreground.\r\n\r\n\r\n1329. AN INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n  _Quiryn Brekelenham_ (Dutch: 1625-1668).\r\n\r\n      A native of Zwammerdam near Leyden, in which town he joined the\r\n      Guild of St. Luke in 1648. He was a pupil of Gerard Dou, but\r\n      did not adopt the high finish of that master; his style may\r\n      be called an admixture of that of Dou with that of Rembrandt.\r\n      He was a painter of quiet interiors, industrious households,\r\n      and kitchen scenes. \"Inspired by Rembrandt's teaching, he\r\n      placed his figures in a beautiful amber light. They are neither\r\n      too graceful nor too striking, but singularly lifelike and\r\n      truthful. The scenes in which he delights are always quiet,\r\n      modest, and sober in movement and expression. His touch is\r\n      free, supple, and soft\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_, p. 182).\r\n      Some of his best works are in the Ryks Museum at Amsterdam. Our\r\n      picture is signed, and dated 1653.\r\n\r\n\r\n1330. THE TRANSFIGURATION.\r\n\r\n  _Duccio_ (Sienese: about 1260-1340). _See 566._\r\n\r\n\"Clinging more closely to Byzantine traditions than any other of the\r\nworks of Duccio in the Gallery, is the panel of 'The Transfiguration,'\r\nwith the folds of the drapery indicated by gold lines. The elements of\r\nthis ancient design, like those of nearly all the Byzantine conceptions\r\nof scenes of sacred history, were never wholly departed from; they\r\nremain still quite recognisable in 'The Transfiguration' of Raphael\"\r\n(Monkhouse: _In the National Gallery_, p. 16).\r\n\r\n\r\n1331. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Bernardino Fungai_ (Sienese: about 1460-1516).\r\n\r\n      \"In flatness, absence of chiaroscuro, and use of gilding, he\r\n      partakes of the Sienese School,\" resembling, for instance,\r\n      Matteo di Giovanni (1155). \"But he is rather pleasing in his\r\n      children and angels, where he is influenced by Perugino; also\r\n      in his landscapes, which, though peculiar in their faint blue\r\n      distance, recall Pinturicchio. A characteristic of the master\r\n      is the heaviness of his hands at the fingers' ends\" (Layard's\r\n      edition of \"Kugler,\" i. 205). Fungai may best be studied in the\r\n      Accademia of Siena.\r\n\r\nThe style of this painter is dismissed by Lanzi as \"dry,\" and by\r\nanother authority as \"dry and stiff.\" There is a certain stiffness,\r\nundoubtedly--due probably in part to religious symbolism--in the hands\r\nof the Virgin and in the upraised finger of the Child, and in those of\r\nthe otherwise human and chubby cherubim. But there is nothing dry or\r\nstiff in the pretty faces of these children, or in the gracious and\r\nbeautiful face of the mother. She is clad in a white-and-gold brocade\r\nof very beautiful pattern. \"One of the finest of the kind known to us,\r\nit appears,\" says the _Athenæum_, \"to be of Venetian origin, and is a\r\npure and perfect diaper, instinct with the choicest Gothic grace and\r\nharmony of line, and betraying but the slightest touch of Orientalism.\r\nThis circumstance attests that the brocade did not come from a Sicilian\r\nloom, while other elements prohibit us from ascribing it to an\r\nultramontane craftsman.\" The landscape background, which has sadly\r\ndarkened, has many quaint figures--on one side Mary, Joseph, and a cow;\r\non the other, the Three Kings and their attendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n1332. GEORGE, 1ST EARL OF BERKELEY.\r\n\r\n  _G. Netscher_ (Dutch: 1639-1784). _See 843._\r\n\r\nThe first Earl of Berkeley--a man of considerable note in his day, and\r\nthe author of a religious work to which some complimentary couplets\r\nby Waller have given a kind of immortality--was born in 1628 and died\r\nin 1698. He was one of the Commissioners nominated in 1660 to proceed\r\nto the Hague to invite Charles to return to the kingdom, and shortly\r\nafterwards he received various important appointments. In 1688, after\r\nthe flight of the King, he was one of the lords assembled at the\r\nGuildhall to draw up the celebrated declaration constituting themselves\r\na provisional government until such time as the Prince of Orange should\r\narrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n1333. THE DEPOSITION FROM THE CROSS.\r\n\r\n  _Tiepolo_ (Venetian: 1692-1769). _See 1192._\r\n\r\n\r\n1334. THE FORTUNE-TELLER.\r\n\r\n  _Pietro Longhi_ (Venetian: 1702-1762). _See 1100._\r\n\r\nA girl, in the hooped dress and three-cornered hat of the 18th century,\r\nis having her hand read by a fortune-teller, while a cloaked cavalier,\r\nstanding near in a white domino, watches the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n1335. THE MADONNA.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (French School: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nThe face is most delicately executed; the white head-cloth and gown\r\nare covered by a blue mantle, which is jewelled and embroidered at the\r\nedge. The originally gold background is now brown; the nimbus of the\r\nVirgin is punctured in a beautiful foliated design.\r\n\r\n\r\n1336. THE DEATH OF DIDO.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Liberale da Verona_ (Veronese: 1451-1535).\r\n  _See 1134._\r\n\r\nPainted probably to adorn the front of a _cassone_ or marriage-chest.\r\n\"The buildings of the forum in which the pyre stands are copied from\r\nwell-known monuments at Verona. In the background on the left are seen\r\ntwo spectators in the everyday costume of the artist's contemporaries.\r\nThe one on the left-hand side seems from his dress to be a German.\r\nDürer has portrayed himself in an exactly similar way. The identity\r\nof the person thus represented will always remain hypothetical;\r\nnevertheless, the soldier leaning on his lance, on the extreme right,\r\npoints directly to Dürer, for the figure is taken from a well-known\r\nengraving by him\" (Dr. Richter in the _Art Journal_, February 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n1337. \"ECCE HOMO!\"\r\n\r\n  _Bazzi_ (Lombard: 1477-1549). _See 1144._\r\n\r\nProbably part of a picture of Christ bearing His Cross. The face wears\r\na gentle, grave, and dignified expression on features of a noble type.\r\n\r\n\r\n1338. THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1339. THE NATIVITY OF ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n  _Bernhard Fabritius_ (Dutch: painted 1650-1672).\r\n\r\n      Of this painter very little is known. He was a member of the\r\n      Painters' Guild at Leyden, and it is clear from his works that\r\n      he was a disciple of Rembrandt.\r\n\r\n(1338). The subject is treated with Dutch directness. It is a Dutch\r\ninterior with Dutch peasants. An opening in the roof discloses a peep\r\nof landscape in the light of early dawn.\r\n\r\n(1339). Somewhat more academic in treatment. The infant saint lies in a\r\nwicker cradle, at the foot of which lies St. Elizabeth, who offers an\r\napple to another child standing by the side of its nurse or mother. To\r\nthe right of the picture St. Zacharias writes on a tablet the record of\r\nthe birth.\r\n\r\n\r\n1340. LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Roeland Roghman_ (Dutch: 1597-1686).\r\n\r\n      Roghman is a landscape-painter widely known by his drawings and\r\n      etchings. He was a friend of Rembrandt. His pictures usually\r\n      represent views in Holland and on the borders of Germany, but\r\n      he travelled also in the Tyrol. His works \"exhibit a close\r\n      attention to nature in the forms, but his colour is dark and\r\n      disagreeable\" (Bryan).\r\n\r\n\r\n1341. A WOODLAND SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelius Decker_ (Dutch: died 1678). _See 134._\r\n\r\n\r\n1342. LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _J. de Wet_ (Dutch: 17th Century).\r\n\r\n      This is the only landscape subject known to bear the signature\r\n      of J. de Wet; other works so signed are of biblical subjects. A\r\n      Jan de Wet, a native of Hamburg, was a pupil of Rembrandt,--a\r\n      tutelage not inconsistent with the style of this picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n1343. AMSTERDAM MUSKETEERS ON PARADE.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Dutch School: about 1650).\r\n\r\nFormerly attributed to Govert Flinck (1615-1660), who was a pupil of\r\nRembrandt, and was commissioned to paint many considerable works for\r\nthe Town Hall of Amsterdam. Observe the group of officers on the left;\r\none bears a standard embroidered with the arms of that city.\r\n\r\n\r\n1344. A LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Salomon Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1600-1670).\r\n\r\n      A good example of one of the founders of the Haarlem School of\r\n      Landscape, uncle of the more famous Jacob Ruysdael. Like his\r\n      nephew, he was a member of the sect of Mennonites. He appears\r\n      to have had some talent for business; he was a prominent\r\n      officer to the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke, and there is a story\r\n      of his having invented a sort of imitation marble, by the sale\r\n      of which he was able to live in easier circumstances than the\r\n      majority of his artistic brethren. Salomon's work resembles\r\n      much that of Van Goyen (see 137), and it is difficult to\r\n      distinguish early works by the two painters. Afterwards they\r\n      diverged. \"Van Goyen prefers the round forms of the clouds\r\n      that on a fine summer day overhang the Maas; his brush always\r\n      plays with the delicacy of their shadows, and loves to turn a\r\n      landscape into what the moderns would call 'a harmony of gray\r\n      and silver.' Salomon Ruysdael is by no means so reticent in the\r\n      matter of colour. His skies in his later period are frankly\r\n      blue\" (_Quarterly Review_, October 1891).\r\n\r\nThere is in this picture \"a peculiarly sharp, clear, and firm touch,\r\nvery like that of Stark of Norwich. The warm, deep-toned evening sky is\r\nadmirable\" (_Athenæum_). The picture is signed, and dated 1659.\r\n\r\n\r\n1345. LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Wouwerman_ (Dutch: 1629-1666).\r\n\r\n      Jan was a younger brother and pupil of the more famous Philips\r\n      (see 878). Some works by another brother, Pieter, may be seen\r\n      in the Dulwich Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n1346. A WINTER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Hendrik van Avercamp_ (Dutch: 1585-1663).\r\n\r\n      A characteristically animated work by the Mute of Kampen, as\r\n      this painter was called. He was the son of a schoolmaster. He\r\n      was born dumb, and documents have been discovered in which his\r\n      mother speaks of her \"dumb and pitiable son.\" Having shown\r\n      an early talent for drawing, he was placed with a painter at\r\n      Amsterdam, and there and at the Hague he practised until 1625.\r\n      He afterwards joined his widowed mother at Kampen. In her will\r\n      of 1633 she made provision for him \"in order that he may not be\r\n      a burden on his brothers and sister.\" He loved especially to\r\n      depict lively scenes of winter sport. He defines his figures\r\n      sharply against the ice and snow. \"The refined modulations of\r\n      tint and the delicacies of aerial perspective, aimed at by\r\n      painters of such scenes in the middle of the 17th century, are\r\n      seldom found in Avercamp's works\" (Official Catalogue).\r\n\r\n\r\n1347. FARMYARD SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Isaak van Ostade_ (Dutch: 1621-1649). _See 847._\r\n\r\nThe crisp touch and golden light in this Cuyp-like picture will please\r\nall lovers of Dutch art.\r\n\r\n\r\n1348. LANDSCAPE WITH GOAT AND KID.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1635-1672). _See 867._\r\n\r\nA pleasant twilight effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n1352. LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _F. de Moucheron_ (Dutch: 1633-1686). _See 842._\r\n\r\nThe signature of the artist is on the cornice of one of the buildings.\r\nPossibly Lingelbach (see 837), who often worked with Moucheron, painted\r\nthe figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n1353. LANDSCAPE WITH SATYRS.\r\n\r\n  _Martin Ryckhaert_ (Flemish: 1587-1631).\r\n\r\n      Martin Ryckhaert was a son of the elder, and brother of the\r\n      younger, David Ryckhaert. He studied, and for some years\r\n      practised his art, in Italy. He is entered in the register of\r\n      the Painters' Guild at Antwerp as \"a painter with one arm,\" and\r\n      is so represented in the portrait by Van Dyck in the Dresden\r\n      Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n1375. CHRIST IN THE HOUSE OF MARTHA.\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish: 1590-1660). _See 197._\r\n\r\nA picture of the earliest, or Seville period of the painter. Though\r\nprofessedly a religious subject, it is in reality one of the\r\n_bodegones_, or tavern-pieces, which had come into favour at Seville\r\nduring the end of the sixteenth century--naturalistic studies of\r\nthe tavern and the kitchen. \"They are certainly to be valued,\" says\r\nPacheco, \"when painted as Velazquez paints them, for in this branch\r\nhe has attained such an eminence that he has left room for no rival.\r\nThey deserve high esteem; for with these elements and with portraiture\r\nhe discovered the true imitation of Nature.\" In the background, shown\r\nthrough a window or square opening in the wall, is seen an inner\r\nchamber with Christ addressing Martha, who stands, and Mary, who kneels\r\nbefore Him.\r\n\r\n\r\n1376. A DUEL IN THE PRADO (A SKETCH).\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish: 1599-1660). _See 197._\r\n\r\nNote that some of the figures in the foreground closely resemble the\r\ngroup in \"The Boar Hunt\" (No. 197).\r\n\r\n\r\n1377. THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.\r\n\r\n  _Venetian School_ (16th Century).\r\n\r\nFormerly ascribed to Savoldo (see 1031). \"In its deep and striking\r\nchiaroscuro it reminds one of a greater and later artist, Bassano,\r\nand even of the earlier works of Velazquez. It is a very interesting\r\npicture, full of imagination, especially in its landscape, and\r\ngenerally in fine condition. For light and effective painting, look at\r\nthe pigeons in the basket on the right\" (Monkhouse: _In the National\r\nGallery_, p. 261). This picture was bequeathed by the late Sir William\r\nGregory, one of the Trustees of the Gallery, who secured it for the\r\npaltry sum of £12: 10s., and was (as we know from his \"Autobiography\")\r\njustly proud of his bargain.[248]\r\n\r\n\r\n1378. AN INTERIOR WITH FIGURES.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Steen_ (Dutch: 1626-1679). _See 856._\r\n\r\nAnother of Sir William's bequests, and, like the preceding, \"a\r\nbargain.\" \"A French dealer,\" he wrote, \"offered me £250 the day after I\r\nhad bought it for £2: 3s.\" An itinerant musician enters the kitchen in\r\na village inn or country farmhouse, and salutes the buxom lady of the\r\nhouse with a fantastic gesture of courtesy. A flute sticks out of his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n1380. FRUIT AND FLOWER PIECE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van Os_ (Dutch: 1744-1808). _See 1015._\r\n\r\n\r\n1381. THE HOLY WOMEN AT THE SEPULCHRE.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Mantegna_ (Paduan: about 1470-1517.)\r\n  _See 639._\r\n\r\nFor the subject, see 576. Notice the pool in the foreground on which\r\nare two water-fowl, while a tortoise crawls towards it. This picture is\r\nthe same size as 639 and 1106, and the three beautiful little panels\r\ndoubtless formed a series--now at last brought together again, having\r\nbeen long separated in three different collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n1383. \"LA JEUNE FEMME AU CLAVECIN.\"\r\n\r\n  _Jan Vermeer of Delft_ (Dutch: 1632-1675).\r\n\r\n      This picture formerly belonged to the celebrated French critic\r\n      Thoré (who wrote under the name of \"W. Bürger\"), to whom\r\n      belongs the credit of having rescued Vermeer from oblivion.\r\n      He was famous in his own day, being one of the chiefs of the\r\n      Delft Guild of Artists. But after his death his works were\r\n      dispersed or destroyed or ascribed to Pieter de Hooch, and\r\n      his very existence was forgotten till \"Bürger's\" researches\r\n      rehabilitated him (see _Gazette des Beaux Arts_, 1866, pp.\r\n      297, 458, 542). He was born in Delft, and was for a short time\r\n      a pupil of Carel Fabritius, a painter who was deeply imbued\r\n      with the spirit and manner of Rembrandt. Vermeer obtained good\r\n      prices for his pictures, but his circumstances cannot have\r\n      been flourishing, for his widow had to apply to the court of\r\n      insolvency to be placed under a curator. His works are now\r\n      rare and costly: for the present picture £2400 was paid. The\r\n      artist with whom Vermeer has the closest affinity is De Hooch.\r\n      At an auction in Amsterdam in the middle of the 17th century a\r\n      De Hooch is praised as being \"nearly equal to the famous Van\r\n      der Meer of Delft,\" and there is often some confusion between\r\n      the works of the two painters. Substitute red for blue, it has\r\n      been said, and a Vermeer becomes a De Hooch. Both painters\r\n      are remarkable for the quality of light displayed in their\r\n      interiors, and Vermeer has never been surpassed in the cool\r\n      general effect which he produced. \"Though in perfection of\r\n      execution,\" says M. Havard, \"the one rivals the other, they\r\n      differ singularly in their use of the brush. Whilst Hooch\r\n      has a vigorous and supple touch, Vermeer on the other hand,\r\n      proceeding by short steps, paints in small patches, and then\r\n      connects the whole by glazing in a manner peculiar to himself,\r\n      which produces a vibrating effect, a characteristic of this\r\n      original painter which we cannot forget\" (_The Dutch School_,\r\n      p. 186). Beauty of tone and perfect harmony are conspicuous\r\n      in all his works, which in some other respects exhibit marked\r\n      differences, for \"the Sphinx of Delft\" (as Bürger calls him)\r\n      had several manners. It is supposed that he worked for a time\r\n      under Rembrandt. The picture of four life-sized figures in\r\n      the Dresden Gallery called \"Les Courtisanes,\" and dated 1656,\r\n      suggests the influence of that master. During the last ten or\r\n      twelve years of his life he adopted a second manner, of greater\r\n      delicacy and subtlety. In all his works there is a singular\r\n      completeness and charm. He is a master in rendering momentary\r\n      expression, and his pictures attract by the successful\r\n      delineation of character, as well as by the skill with which he\r\n      makes his figures move in light and air. He has also a complete\r\n      mastery of perspective, and in his effects of light upon flat\r\n      surfaces he is unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nThis picture is a good example of the qualities described above.[249]\r\n\"The head, however, has unfortunately suffered from over-cleaning,\r\nshowing the gray under-painting which gives the picture a colder\r\naspect than it would otherwise have\" (Official Catalogue). The picture\r\nhas a very good \"pedigree,\" Bürger, to whom it once belonged, having\r\ntraced it back, through the Solly and Danser-Nyman Collections, to an\r\nanonymous sale catalogue of 1714.\r\n\r\n\r\n1386. SOLDIERS QUARRELLING OVER THEIR BOOTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1387. PLAYERS AT TRIC-TRAC.\r\n\r\n  _W. C. Duyster_ (Dutch: 1599-1635).\r\n\r\nThese pictures are by one of the rarest of the Dutch masters--William\r\nCornells Duyster, a painter of Amsterdam. They were acquired from a\r\nfamily in whose possession they have been ever since they were brought\r\nover to this country by an officer in the army of William III. The fine\r\nexecution and brilliant condition of the pictures make them decidedly\r\nattractive. They are both signed; 1386, on a box in the foreground;\r\n1387, on the border of the beautifully-painted tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n1390. A SEA-PIECE.\r\n\r\n  _Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1628-1682). _See 627._\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of Ruysdael's sea-pieces, in which he was not\r\nsurpassed by any painter of the time. The view represented is the shore\r\nat Scheveningen. This picture, for which the sum of £3045 was paid by\r\nthe nation, changed hands in 1872 for £68 as one of a pair!\r\n\r\n\r\n1393. A MEDITERRANEAN SEAPORT.\r\n\r\n  _Claude Joseph Vernet_ (French: 1714-1789). _See 236._\r\n\r\nThe frigate is flying the Dutch tricolor flag. At the foot of the\r\nfortified wall is a party of Turkish or Albanian merchants.\r\n\r\n\r\n1397. AN OLD WOMAN SEWING.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Dutch School: 17th Century).\r\n\r\nOn the wall behind is an engraved portrait of a gentleman, with an\r\ninscription in which the name, Jan van Aach, and the date 1655 occur.\r\nThe name is possibly that of the unknown painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n1399. PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard Terburg_ (Dutch: 1617-1681). _See 864._\r\n\r\nThis and the following picture were in the collection of the late\r\nSir Charles Eastlake. By the provisions of his will, they were to be\r\noffered to the National Gallery at the prices he paid for them, viz.\r\n£25 and £75.\r\n\r\n\r\n1400. CHRIST BEFORE PILATE.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See 45._\r\n\r\nThis sketch is the original study for the etching of the same subject\r\ndone in 1636. It is signed with the artist's name underneath the clock\r\nwhich is above the arched entrance on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n1401. A FRUIT-PIECE.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Snyers_ (Flemish: 1681-1752).\r\n\r\n      A painter of fruit and flower pieces, landscapes, portraits,\r\n      and figure subjects of low life; was Director of the Royal\r\n      Academy of Antwerp.\r\n\r\nFowls, cray-fish, artichokes, lobsters, peaches, plums, strawberries,\r\nasparagus, radishes, and peonies--\"all represented of natural size\r\nand distributed in picturesque confusion.\" The artist's signature is\r\nincluded, as if embroidered on the corner of the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n1406. THE ANNUNCIATION.\r\n\r\n  _School of Fra Angelico_ (Florentine: 1387-1455). _See 663._\r\n\r\n\"Through an arched opening behind the Virgin we see a sort of cloister\r\ngarth. There are daisies on the sward, and in a pot stands a tall lily.\r\nA similar opening behind the Archangel reveals another part of the\r\ngarth, enclosed on all sides by a rose trellis. Beyond the trellis are\r\nvisible a hill and a convent resembling that of San Miniato, rows of\r\ncypresses, and more distinct peaks in fuller light. The embroideries,\r\nthe angel's plumage, and both the _nimbi_, are represented in real\r\ngold, while the last are incised in radial lines, so that, like the\r\nwings, their brilliance is distinct, and they shimmer in the light. On\r\nthe capitals of two of the columns of the cloister the red annulets\r\nupon a silver shield of the Albizzi family are seen\" (_Athenæum_).\r\nThe composition of this not very attractive picture recalls the\r\nAnnunciations by Fra Angelico, at Cortona and in the Madrid Gallery\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n1409. THE MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Cordelle Agii_ (Venetian: School of Bellini).\r\n\r\n      This picture is a repetition of one by Andrea Previtali in the\r\n      sacristy of the Church of San Giobbe at Venice, and the painter\r\n      has been supposed to be the same as Previtali. This, however,\r\n      is probably not the case. The present picture is signed (on a\r\n      cartellino) \"1504: Andreas Cordelli Agy dissipulus Jovannis\r\n      Bellini pinxit.\" He similarly describes himself as a pupil\r\n      of John Bellini on a picture in the Poldi Pezzoli Gallery at\r\n      Milan. Judging from his name, \"twists and needles,\" he or his\r\n      father was probably a pedlar (Layard's edition of \"Kugler,\" i.\r\n      334).\r\n\r\n\"The conjecture that Andrea Previtali is identical with Andrea Cordelle\r\nAgii seems to me,\" says Morelli, \"untenable. Both were fellow-scholars\r\nin the workshop of Giovanni Bellini, and it is undeniable that in\r\nsome of their works they closely resemble each other; but this may be\r\nexplained by the fact that the one probably copied the cartoons or even\r\nthe pictures of the other. The few signed works which I have met with\r\nby Cordelle Agii appear to me, however, to be more refined and lifelike\r\nin expression, and his landscapes are warmer and less vividly green in\r\ntone, than those of Previtali\" (_Roman Galleries_, p. 237 _n._). As\r\na picture by Previtali hangs close by (No. 695), the reader is in a\r\nposition to consider the justness of the critic's remarks for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n1410. VIRGIN AND CHILD\r\n\r\n  _Borgognone_ (Lombard: about 1455-1523). _See 298._\r\n\r\nThe nimbus which surrounds the Virgin's head is inscribed in gold\r\nwith the words AVE. MARIA. GRATIA. PLENA. DOM. The background is\r\ninteresting. On the right is no doubt a faithful view of part of the\r\nold façade of the Certosa of Pavia before it was completed. On the\r\nleft are other buildings which appear to be part of a convent, with\r\nCarthusian friars walking in front. This picture is earlier in date\r\nthan Borgognone's \"Two St. Catherines\" (298); it is \"more rigid in\r\nstyle and a capital example of the painter's less ambitious work\"\r\n(Catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club's Exhibition, 1898, p.\r\nxxxvii.).\r\n\r\n\r\n1411. A DIPTYCH.\r\n\r\n  _Ercole Roberti de' Grandi_ (Ferrarese: 1450-1496). _See 1127._\r\n\r\nOn the left the Adoration of the Shepherds. There is much natural charm\r\nin the figure of the Virgin bending over the manger. On the right the\r\ndead figure of Christ, with St. Jerome and St. Francis in the middle\r\ndistance receiving the stigmata. Very delicately finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n1412. VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n  _Filippino Lippi_ (Florentine: 1457-1504). _See 293._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\nFormerly ascribed to Botticelli.[250] Notice the beautifully painted\r\nwhite eglantine and jasmine blossoms in the vase on the balcony. The\r\nyouthful St. John is an attractive figure, very characteristic of this\r\ngroup of painters.\r\n\r\n\r\n1415. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard Dou_ (Dutch; 1613-1675). _See 192._\r\n\r\n\"An old inscription on the back of the panel states that this picture\r\nis a portrait of Anna Maria van Schurmann; but it will be observed\r\nthat the portrait by Jan Lievens (1095), supposed to represent the\r\nsame lady, differs in the colour of the hair, and has other points of\r\nvariation, which preclude the possibility of both having been painted\r\nfrom the same person\" (Official Catalogue).\r\n\r\n\r\n1416. VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Filippo Mazzola_ (Parmese: died 1505).\r\n\r\n      The Mazzola family affords one of the many instances in the\r\n      history of painting of artistic heredity. Filippo's two\r\n      brothers were also painters, and his son was the more famous\r\n      Parmigiano (see under 33). The Mazzoli were much employed\r\n      in Parma, but their work seldom rose above mediocrity.\r\n      By Filippo--called _delle erbette_ from the plants which\r\n      he was fond of introducing into his pictures--there are\r\n      religious-subject pictures to be seen at Parma. But he is best\r\n      known for his portraits, in which the influence of Antonello da\r\n      Messina is to be traced (see Morelli's _German Galleries_, p.\r\n      418). An excellent one in the Brera bears his signature.\r\n\r\nThis picture is in its original frame, of early _cinque-cento_ pattern,\r\nrichly carved, gilt, and painted. A somewhat similar frame has recently\r\nbeen given to the \"Vision of St. Eustace\" (1436).\r\n\r\n\r\n1417. CHRIST'S AGONY IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Mantegna_ (Paduan: 1431-1506). _See 274._\r\n\r\nA celebrated picture (painted in 1459 for Giacomo Marcello,\r\nPodestà of Padua), and a specially interesting acquisition to our\r\nGallery--first, as belonging to an earlier period of the master than\r\nhis other important works here; and secondly, for its strong family\r\nlikeness to the picture of the same subject by his brother-in-law,\r\nGiovanni Bellini, which, hangs in an adjoining room (No. 726). At\r\nthe time when these pictures were painted Giovanni and Andrea were\r\nworking at Padua under the influence of Giovanni's father, Jacopo\r\nBellini (Vasari has some family gossip on this subject, ii. 265);\r\nand the original suggestion for the treatment of the subject in both\r\npictures appears in Jacopo's sketch-book, now in the British Museum.\r\nA prominent object in the distance (an Italian version of Jerusalem)\r\nis a little gilt equestrian statue, which was evidently suggested by\r\nDonatello's equestrian statue of Gattamelata, still to be seen at\r\nPadua. The foreshortening of the apostles suggests the work of Uccello\r\n(see 583), who is known to have painted in that city. The picture\r\nhas been described as \"a marvellous combination of the fantastic and\r\nthe realistic\"; note for curious details the rabbits and storks, and\r\nthe cormorant on the withered tree. This picture is more quaint than\r\nBellini's; but Bellini's is the more original. \"Mantegna's,\" says\r\nMr. Monkhouse, \"exhibits only a strong personal treatment of old\r\nconventions: Bellini's proclaims the dawn of a new world of art. What\r\nwas old in the pictures--the Christ kneeling on a little hill, with\r\nthe sleepy apostles in foreshortened attitudes in the foreground,\r\nthe angelic vision on a cloud, and the suggestion of a neighbouring\r\ncity--are common to both pictures. What was new--the fresh observation\r\nof nature for its own sake--is found only in Bellini's. We see this\r\nin the smouldering clouds of sunset, the light thrown on the distant\r\nbuildings, the half-shade on the cliffs, the bringing-out of the\r\nfigures into something like the real open, sun-illumined air, the\r\nattempt at solution of the problem of the tone of a face and figure\r\nrelieved right against the sky\" (_In the National Gallery_, 1895, p.\r\n192).\r\n\r\n\r\n1417a. ILLUMINATED INITIAL LETTER.\r\n\r\nThe letter D: enclosed within it is painted \"The Agony in the Garden,\"\r\ncopied from the preceding picture by Mantegna. The picture and this\r\nletter were both in the collection of Lord Northbrook.\r\n\r\n\r\n1418. ST. JEROME IN HIS STUDY.\r\n\r\n  _Antonello da Messina_ (Venetian: 1444-1493).\r\n\r\nA celebrated little picture, with a long critical history, for as early\r\nas 1529 the writer known as the \"_anonimo_ of Morelli\" mentions it as\r\nbeing variously attributed to Van Eyck, to Memlinc, and to Antonello,\r\nwhile he himself ascribed it tentatively to \"Jacometto\" (Jacopo de'\r\nBarbari). The influence of the Flemish School is obvious, says Sir\r\nEdward Poynter, \"in the Gothic character of the architecture, the\r\ngeneral arrangement of the picture, and the finish of the details. But\r\nthe head of the saint has an energy of character highly characteristic\r\nof Antonello, and the buildings in the glimpse of landscape seen\r\nthrough the window on the left are distinctly Italian in character\"\r\n(_The National Gallery_, i. 14). It is interesting to compare this\r\npicture with the version of the same subject commonly ascribed to\r\nBellini (694). Observe, here, \"the lion walking along the cloister,\r\nholding up a suffering paw, and the puss curled up on a platform at\r\nthe saint's feet. Evidently this St. Jerome was a lover of animals,\r\nand, like Canon Liddon, more especially of cats\" (\"The Beasts of the\r\nNational Gallery,\" by Sophia Beale, in _Good Words_, July 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n1419. THE LEGEND OF ST. GILES.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish School: 15th Century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\n      \"St. Giles, patron saint of Edinburgh, and of woods, cripples,\r\n      lepers, and beggars, was an Athenian prince, revered for his\r\n      miraculous gifts. Having healed a sick man whom he found in a\r\n      church by laying his cloak over him, and fearing danger to his\r\n      soul from the fame which this event obtained him, he withdrew\r\n      to a solitary cave, where he lived as a hermit, nourished only\r\n      by wild herbs and the milk of a doe which had followed him. One\r\n      day the King of France, hunting near this retreat, shot the\r\n      doe, and, pursuing it, came upon the aged hermit holding in his\r\n      arms the doe, which was pierced by the arrow through his hand.\r\n      The King, seeing he was a man of God, begged forgiveness, and\r\n      wished to persuade St. Giles to return with him; but he refused\r\n      to quit his solitude, and remained in the cave till his death\"\r\n      (_Saints and their Symbols_, by E. A. G., 1881, p. 95).\r\n\r\nHere we see the saint, clad in hermit's robes, protecting the doe,\r\nwhich has fled from the hunting party towards him; his right hand is\r\ntransfixed by an arrow, intended for the animal. The King kneels to\r\nimplore forgiveness. He is attended by a companion, who is supposed\r\nto represent the painter of the picture. Notice the irises in the\r\nforeground, and to the right a plant of mullein, finished with great\r\ndelicacy. \"Remarkable as an example of extraordinary finish and\r\nenamel-like splendour of colour. Remarkable also for the flood of\r\neven, gay daylight diffused over it, such as makes us think of the\r\nmore moderate among recent _plein air_ transcripts from nature. But\r\nthe painter shows more of that intense humanity, of that command over\r\ndelicate shades of character and facial expression which are the\r\nhighest characteristic of the great Netherlandish masters of his time\"\r\n(Claude Phillips, in _National Review_, Dec. 1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n1420. A VIEW IN HAARLEM.\r\n\r\n  _Gerrit Berck-Heyde_ (Dutch: 1638-1698).\r\n\r\n      Gerrit, and his elder brother, Job, were the sons of a butcher\r\n      at Haarlem. Gerrit was very skilful in lineal perspective,\r\n      and reproduced with remarkable fidelity the most complicated\r\n      architectural views. The brothers worked together a great deal,\r\n      and Job often painted the figures in Gerrit's pictures. \"The\r\n      pictures of both brothers are remarkable for a broad style of\r\n      painting, for brilliant sunlight, and careful, but not over\r\n      elaborate, drawing of details, and the figures are invariably\r\n      well grouped\" (Official Catalogue).\r\n\r\nA view of the painter's favourite subject, the market-place of Haarlem.\r\nThe picture is signed, and dated 1674.\r\n\r\n\r\n1421. A TERRACE SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Steen_ (Dutch: 1626-1679). _See 856._\r\n\r\n\r\n1422. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Eustache Le Sueur_ (French: 1616-1655)\r\n\r\n      Le Sueur, sometimes styled \"the French Raphael,\" was the son of\r\n      a wood-carver at Paris, and became one of the original members\r\n      of the French Academy. His works, in spite of the early age\r\n      at which he died, are very numerous. He was assisted in the\r\n      production of them by three brothers and his brothers-in-law.\r\n      Several of his most important pictures are to be seen at the\r\n      Louvre.\r\n\r\nThis little picture is a good example of the painter's\r\ncharacteristics--with its somewhat crude colour, but considerable\r\ngracefulness, especially in the figure of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n\r\n1423. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Jan A. Ravesteijn_ (Dutch: 1572-1657).\r\n\r\n      This artist was born at the Hague, where his most important\r\n      works are to be found. He was admitted into the Painters'\r\n      Guild there in 1598. He was a pupil of Frans Hals, and was\r\n      much employed in painting the large groups of portraits--of\r\n      archers, magistrates, etc.--which were in vogue at the time.\r\n      Ravesteijn's groups are somewhat more formal than those of\r\n      Rembrandt, Hals, and Van der Helst, but are full of life and\r\n      character. He knew how to give dignity to his sitters, and his\r\n      pictures are inferior only to those of the great masters just\r\n      mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n1424. TOBIAS AND THE ANGEL.\r\n\r\n  _Adam Elsheimer_ (German: 1578-1620). _See 1014._\r\n\r\nA favourite subject with this painter. It was etched in 1613 by Count\r\nGondt, who was the painter's chief benefactor; he purchased some\r\nof Elsheimer's choicest pictures, and engraved seven of them. The\r\ncopper-plate of this subject fell into the hands of Rembrandt, and was\r\npartly erased and altered by him into another subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n1425. PORTRAIT GROUP.\r\n\r\n  _Le Nain_ (French: 1588-1648).\r\n\r\n      There were three brothers of this name, the sons of a sergeant\r\n      at Laon, who all worked together as painters in Paris, and\r\n      became members of the Academy in 1648, in which year two of\r\n      them died. Mathieu painted historical subjects; he lived\r\n      till 1677. The very interesting and pleasing pictures, such\r\n      as the present one, most generally known as the works of Le\r\n      Nain, were probably painted by the other brothers--Louis and\r\n      Antoine--conjointly. Antoine was born in 1588; Louis in 1593.\r\n      Their works consist of familiar objects and incidents, such\r\n      as the \"Peasants\" and the \"Blacksmith's Forge\" in the Louvre;\r\n      they have a direct air of truth and realism, which is very\r\n      remarkable in contrast to the artificial taste by which other\r\n      French painters of the same period were inspired. Another work\r\n      by the brothers may be seen at Dulwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n1427. THE DEAD CHRIST: A PIETÀ.\r\n\r\n  _Hans Baldung_ (German-Swabian: 1476-1545). _See 245._\r\n\r\nSigned and dated \"Hans Baldung, 1512.\" The Virgin's attitude is\r\nexpressive of intense sorrow. \"Her mouth is drawn convulsively down in\r\nthe manner usual in the pictures of Burgkmair and the school and epoch\r\nto which he and Baldung belonged. On our right is St. John. Behind the\r\ngroup is Joseph of Arimathea. Behind, God the Father appears, robed\r\nin blue under a red mantle, and holding across His knees the drooping\r\ncorpse of the Redeemer. Clouds form the background, and among them the\r\nHoly Ghost is hovering. The heads of all the figures bear plain nimbi\r\nof metallic gold. The draperies, except the loin-cloth of Christ, are\r\nsomewhat tortured in the manner of the German painters of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. On the front of the balcony in which they are placed are\r\ndepicted the donor and his family; in one corner is their escutcheon,\r\nbearing three money bags and a broad bar\" (_Athenæum_, Jan. 11, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n1429. THE ROTUNDA AT RANELAGH.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See 127._\r\n\r\nThe interior of the Rotunda in Ranelagh Gardens (at Chelsea), which\r\nwere opened as a rival to Vauxhall in 1742, and at once became the\r\nrage. \"Ranelagh has totally beat Vauxhall,\" wrote Walpole in 1744;\r\n\"nobody goes anywhere else.\" \"When I first entered Ranelagh,\" said Dr.\r\nJohnson, \"it gave me an expansion and gay sensation in my mind such as\r\nI never experienced anywhere else.\" Smollett describes it in his novels\r\nas an \"enchanted palace.\" \"Ranelagh,\" said Rogers (\"Table-Talk\"), \"was\r\na very pleasant place of amusement. There persons of inferior rank\r\nmingled with the highest nobility of Britain. All was so orderly and\r\nstill that you could hear the _whisking_ sound of the ladies' trains as\r\nthe immense assembly walked round and round the room. If you chose, you\r\nmight have tea, which was served up in the neatest equipage possible.\"\r\nThe dining boxes under the arcade on the ground level are shown in the\r\npicture, as well as the orchestra, the musicians, and the numerous\r\ngaily-dressed promenaders. On the back of the original canvas was an\r\ninscription by the artist, recording that the picture was painted in\r\nLondon in 1754.\r\n\r\n\r\n1430. ARCHITECTURAL SUBJECT WITH FIGURES.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Beccafumi_ (Sienese: 1486-1551).\r\n\r\n      Of this painter there is a very interesting account in Vasari.\r\n      His surname was adopted from his patron, on whose estate\r\n      Domenico's father was a labourer. Like Giotto, Domenico was\r\n      observed one day drawing on the ground, while minding his\r\n      father's sheep, and his master sent him to school and made an\r\n      artist of him. His style was first formed on that of Perugino,\r\n      whose pictures in Siena he copied. In 1510 he went to Rome to\r\n      study the works of Michael Angelo and Raphael; but returning\r\n      to Siena in 1512, he became a close imitator of Bazzi (1144),\r\n      who had recently settled in the city. Unlike Bazzi, Domenico\r\n      was (adds Vasari) \"most orderly and well conducted, lived as\r\n      it beseemed a Christian to do, and passed the greater part\r\n      of his time alone.\" \"It will nevertheless sometimes happen,\"\r\n      adds Vasari, \"that such as are called good fellows and merry\r\n      companions are more sought after than are the virtuous and\r\n      upright.\" In the matter of artistic commissions, however,\r\n      Beccafumi was well employed, in painting both altar-pieces for\r\n      churches and frescoes of classical subjects for the houses of\r\n      wealthy citizens. Some of the latter still remain _in situ_,\r\n      while the Accademia contains Beccafumi's best works in the\r\n      other sort. It was he who executed the mosaics of light and\r\n      dark marbles which form the pavement of the choir of the Duomo.\r\n      He also practised sculpture and did eight angels in bronze for\r\n      the Duomo. He hastened his death, says Vasari, \"by labouring\r\n      day and night at his castings of metal which he would also\r\n      finish and polish himself, working entirely alone, and refusing\r\n      to accept any assistance whatever.\" He occupied his leisure\r\n      time in cultivating a small property outside the city gates. He\r\n      could not work, he told Vasari, removed from the air of Siena.\r\n\r\nA picture corresponding in general character to several described by\r\nVasari. It is probably intended as a fantastic treatment of the visit\r\nof the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon, or of Esther before Ahasuerus.\r\n\r\n\r\n1431. THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Perugino_ (Umbrian: 1446-1523). _See 288._\r\n\r\nAround this little picture of the Umbrian School, bought by Sir Edward\r\nPoynter at Rome in 1894, a fierce battle of the critics has raged. Sir\r\nEdward's own description may first be cited:--\"A perfectly genuine\r\nwork by a scholar of Perugino, probably done in his studio, and, in my\r\nopinion, possibly by the young Raphael. The most characteristic point,\r\nbesides the beautiful painting of the figure of the Saviour, is the\r\ndrawing of the hands, which is precisely Raphael's. On the other hand,\r\nthe heads are not specially Raphaelesque, nor is the colour as pure\r\nand transparent as is usual even in his early work; at the same time,\r\nsuch characteristics as do not agree with what we know of his work\r\nmight possibly be due to its being a youthful performance. The painting\r\nof the trees is quite peculiar, and different from the treatment to\r\nbe found in the works of Perugino, or, indeed, of any work of the\r\nschool that I had seen. Some two or three years afterwards I saw the\r\npredella painting of 'St. John Preaching' by Raphael, belonging to the\r\nMarquis of Lansdowne, and was very interested to find in it the same\r\ntreatment of the leaves of the trees--that is to say, that, instead\r\nof the minute and delicate sprays of foliage, so characteristic of\r\nPerugino's own work and of, so far as I know, most of his followers,\r\nthe trees have only a few sprays of large and freely painted leaves.\"\r\nAccording to many of Sir Edward's critics, the picture is a \"detestable\r\nlittle production\"; while one of them ascribes it, as a work of the\r\nnineteenth century, to Micheli, \"a maker of old masters.\" (See a\r\ncopious correspondence in the _Athenæum_ and the _Times_, during March\r\nand April, 1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n1432. THE MARRIAGE OF ST. CATHERINE.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard David_ (Early Flemish: 1460-1523). _See 1045._\r\n\r\nThis picture (formerly ascribed to Hugo van der Goes) was, like No.\r\n1045, painted for the Collegiate Church of St. Donatian at Bruges.\r\nUntil the end of the last century it adorned the altar of St.\r\nCatherine in that church. The details of the picture are carried out\r\nwith marvellous care and finish, and the whole displays the utmost\r\nperfection of execution. The expression of the figures, is, however,\r\nhardly so animated or idealised as in No. 1045. But \"the Canon's\r\nintelligent head is admirably modelled and painted, and the figure\r\nof St. Catherine is executed with rare perfection. The jewellery,\r\nstuff, and draperies are all rendered with David's usual skill; while\r\nthe background, with its rich vegetation, vigorously coloured trees,\r\nand picturesque buildings, is hardly surpassed by that of any of his\r\nother pictures.\" The scene of the mystical marriage (for the subject,\r\nsee under 249) is laid in the emblematic walled garden (\"a garden\r\ninclosed is my sister, my spouse\"), surrounded by a vineyard (in\r\nwhich is an angel gathering grapes). On the right of the picture are\r\nseated St. Barbara, holding an open book, and St. Mary Magdalene with\r\nthe vase of precious ointment in her lap. In front of St. Catherine\r\nkneels the donor of the picture, Richard de Visch van der Capelle,\r\nCanon and Cantor of the Church; he is accompanied by his greyhound, on\r\nwhose collar is a shield bearing the Canon's arms. Before him, on the\r\nfloor, lie a breviary of blue velvet and his precentor's staff. The\r\nworkmanship of this staff is a good instance of the painter's minute\r\nprecision. The staff is surmounted by a group representing the Holy\r\nTrinity adored by a monk and a cardinal. It was painted from a staff\r\npresented to the church in 1338, and the picture precisely corresponds\r\nto a description of the staff, to be found in an old inventory of the\r\nchurch property (see authorities cited in the Official Catalogue from\r\nMr. Weale's description in the _Academy_, xiv. p. 391).\r\n\r\nThe picture was exhibited at Paris in 1881 under the name of Hugo van\r\nder Goes, and was sold for 54,100 francs. It ultimately passed into the\r\npossession of Mr. Lyne Stephens, by whom in 1895 it was bequeathed to\r\nthe National Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n1433. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish School: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nNotice the transparent starched muslin head-dress which, coming down as\r\nlow as the eyebrows and covering the ears, yet allows the forehead and\r\nears, and a high cap of gold and white brocade, to be seen through its\r\nthin texture.\r\n\r\n\r\n1434. A BETROTHAL.\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish: 1599-1660). _See 197._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\nAn unfinished picture once in the possession of Sir Edwin Landseer,\r\nand presented to the Gallery by Lord Savile, who has given a very\r\ninteresting surmise of the subject: \"It is evidently the representation\r\nof a betrothal in a private family, probably that of Velazquez himself.\r\nIf this surmise be correct, the principal male figure would be\r\nVelazquez as a Knight of the Order of Santiago, the red cross of which,\r\nthough half concealed, is seen on his cloak; the mother presenting\r\nher child would be his daughter, the wife of the artist Del Mazo, his\r\npupil and son-in-law, and the girl, their daughter, the grandchild of\r\nVelazquez. The foreground is occupied on the right by a half-length\r\nfigure of the poet Quevedo, with a huge pair of horn spectacles, as he\r\nis represented in his portrait by Velazquez at Apsley House, though\r\nhere he is a much older man. He was a great friend of Velazquez, and\r\nin this picture may represent the witness to the betrothal of the\r\nartist's grandchild. On the right is a negro, probably Juan Pareja,\r\nthe favourite slave of Velazquez, who is conveying a basket of fruit\r\nto his young mistress. Velazquez himself is waiting, pen in hand, for\r\nthe 'promesso sposo,' who, though not shown in the picture, may be\r\nentering the room by the portière which an attendant is raising; but\r\nhe is seen by the little bride elect, who waves a salute to him with\r\nthe flower in her hand. [Contrast, as a pretty little incident, the dog\r\nwho is running towards the door and barking at the stranger.] It is\r\nnot surprising that a painting of this unusual character should give\r\nrise to doubt as to the correctness of its attribution, and it has been\r\nsuggested that it is the work of Del Mazo, the pupil of Velazquez; but\r\nif that artist had been commissioned to paint the portrait of a knight\r\nof Santiago, his sitter would scarcely have been satisfied with the\r\nscanty indication of that celebrated order shown in this picture. If,\r\nhowever, as I believe, the knight of Santiago represents Velazquez\r\nhimself, the half-hidden cross of that order assumes an aspect that\r\nmay have an important bearing on the questions of the authorship\r\nof the picture, the date of the work, and the cause of its being\r\nunfinished. Stirling-Maxwell, in his admirable and exhaustive _Annals\r\nof the Artists of Spain_, relates that Philip IV. in 1658 conferred on\r\nVelazquez the habit of the Order of Santiago; but it was not for many\r\nmonths later that the artist was invested with its insignia, owing\r\nto the formalities required by the Order to prove his pedigree. The\r\nKing, impatient at this delay, sent for the President of the Order\r\nand the documents connected with the case, and having looked at them\r\nhis Majesty said to the President, 'Place on record that the evidence\r\nsatisfies me.' The half-concealed red cross of Santiago in the picture\r\nwas sufficient for Velazquez to show that he was entitled to the Order,\r\nbut, with the modesty and conscientiousness that distinguished him, he\r\ndid not design the insignia on his breast, where it is worn, apparently\r\nnot feeling justified in so doing until after his investiture. This,\r\nhowever, did not occur till November 1659. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat the picture must have been painted in 1658, after he had received\r\nthe habit, but not the insignia, of the Order. That the picture was\r\nleft unfinished was doubtless due to the onerous duties with which\r\nVelazquez was charged by the King in preparing the meeting on the\r\nBidassoa, in 1660, of the French and Spanish Courts, to celebrate the\r\nnuptials of Louis XIV. and the Infanta Maria Teresa. These duties\r\ndoubled the official fatigues and shortened the life of Velazquez, who\r\ndied shortly after his return to Madrid in August of the same year.\r\nThere is, therefore, good reason to believe that the picture in the\r\nNational Gallery is the last ever painted by Velazquez\" (letter to the\r\n_Times_, May 11, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n1436. THE VISION OF ST. EUSTACE.\r\n\r\n  _Vittore Pisano_ (Veronese: 1380-1452). _See 776._\r\n\r\n\"The minute but unobtrusive finish of the picture is,\" says the\r\nOfficial Catalogue, \"astonishing. Of the coats of the horse, dogs,\r\nstag, and other wild animals introduced every hair is drawn; and of the\r\nwild birds, every feather; nor are they less remarkable for the beauty\r\nof the drawing and the admirable character displayed, in which it may\r\nbe truly said this painter has never been excelled. Numerous studies\r\nof animals of the highest beauty are to be found in collections of\r\ndrawings throughout Europe, some of them evidently done in preparation\r\nfor this picture.\" St. Eustace, whose name before his conversion was\r\nPlacidus, was a Roman soldier, a captain of the guards in the reign of\r\nthe Emperor Trajan. He was a great lover of the chase, and \"one day,\r\nwhile hunting in the forest, he saw before him a stag of marvellous\r\nbeauty. He pursued it eagerly, and the stag fled before him, and\r\nascended a high rock. Then Placidus, looking up, beheld, between the\r\nhorns of the stag, a cross of radiant light, and on it the image of the\r\ncrucified Redeemer; and being astonished and dazzled by this vision, he\r\nfell on his knees, and a voice, which seemed to come from the crucifix,\r\ncried to him, and said, 'Placidus! why dost thou pursue me? I am\r\nChrist, whom thou hast hitherto served without knowing me. Dost thou\r\nnow believe?' And Placidus fell with his face to the earth, and said,\r\n'Lord, I believe!' And when he looked up again the wondrous vision had\r\ndeparted. And he returned to his house and was baptized with his wife\r\nand children\" (Mrs. Jameson: _Sacred and Legendary Art_, 1850, p. 466).\r\nFor a representation of the very similar legend of St. Hubert, see No.\r\n783. This beautiful picture (from Lord Ashburnham's Collection) has\r\nbeen placed in a very elaborate frame in the Italian style: compare No.\r\n1416.\r\n\r\n\r\n1437. THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST.\r\n\r\n  _Barnaba da Modena_ (painted about 1365).\r\n\r\nA specimen, very well preserved, of the Giottesque period of Italian\r\nart. The painter, a native of Modena, appears to have worked chiefly in\r\nPiedmont and Pisa. Examples of his work may be seen in the Galleries of\r\nPisa, Turin, Frankfort, and Berlin. It is pointed out as noticeable,\r\nin the Official Catalogue, that the drapery of the Virgin Mary is\r\ntreated in the hieratic or Byzantine manner, while that of the Apostles\r\nis in the naturalistic manner of Giotto. For a similar instance of\r\ntransitional treatment, see Duccio's \"Transfiguration,\" No. 1330.\r\n\r\n\r\n1438. HEAD OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Lombard School: 16th Century).\r\n\r\nA head of great beauty and much pathos of expression. An inscription on\r\nthe background gives the date of the picture, 1511.\r\n\r\n\r\n1439. FISHING IN THE RIVER.\r\n\r\n  _Salomon Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1600-1670). _See 1344._\r\n\r\nAn early work. Signed, and dated 1631. \"The sky is partly covered with\r\nsoft, gray clouds, and the whole scene gives the impression of a still\r\nand peaceful summer's day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1440. ST. DOMINIC.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_ (Venetian: 1427-1516). _See 189._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\nThe portrait of a monk (on the parapet is an inscription recording\r\nthat it is a likeness of Brother Theodore of Urbino) in the character\r\nof St. Dominic. He wears the Dominican robe, and the name of the saint\r\nis inscribed on the label of the book which he holds, and carries the\r\nusual attributes of the saint, the lily and a book (on the label of\r\nwhich are the words \"Sanctus Dominicus\"). The inscription is dated\r\n1515, so that if genuine this must be one of the painter's last works.\r\nNo. 808 is another portrait of a monk ascribed to the same painter--in\r\ncharacter as one of the saints (St. Peter Martyr). Signor Frizzoni\r\nattributes both of them to Gentile Bellini.\r\n\r\n\r\n1441. THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.\r\n\r\n  _Perugino_ (Umbrian: 1446-1523). _See 288._\r\n\r\nThis fresco from the church at Fontignano, near Castello della Pieve,\r\nwas left unfinished when the painter died there in 1523, in his 77th\r\nyear; it is believed to be his last work (_see_ Vasari, ii. 323). The\r\nfresco was transferred to canvas and removed in 1843. It was purchased\r\nin 1862 from Mr. Spence of Florence, by the South Kensington Museum.\r\n\"The hand had not lost its cunning, and there is much of the early\r\nsweetness in this huge fresco. There is the charm of its faded blues\r\nand purples, the haze of its shimmering sunshine, and the tender\r\nreverence of the kneeling figures\" (G. C. Williamson: _Perugino_, o, p.\r\n110).\r\n\r\n\r\n1442. SHIPS IN A GALE.\r\n\r\n  _Bakhuizen_ (Dutch: 1631-1708). _See 204._\r\n\r\n\r\n1443. INTERIOR OF A CHURCH.\r\n\r\n  _H. Steenwyck_ (Flemish: 1580-1649). _See 1132._\r\n\r\nA funeral service is being celebrated in the nave, while in the\r\nforeground is a christening procession.\r\n\r\n\r\n1444. PEASANTS WARMING THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard von Honthorst_ (Dutch: 1590-1656).\r\n\r\n      This artist went early in life to Rome, where he acquired the\r\n      style of Caravaggio (see 172). \"His rude contrasts of opaque\r\n      shade and brilliant light, his luminous effects produced by\r\n      the light of a torch or flambeau, and the naturalism of his\r\n      works, caused him to be much sought after in Italy, where\r\n      this style was in fashion,\" and acquired for him the name of\r\n      \"Gherardo della Notte.\" He returned to Utrecht, his birthplace,\r\n      in 1623, and in 1628 was commissioned by Charles I. to decorate\r\n      the palace of Whitehall. While in England he also painted the\r\n      portraits of the Court and many of the nobility. Several of his\r\n      portraits are to be seen in the National Portrait Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n1445, 1446. STUDIES OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n  _Rachel Ruysch_ (Dutch: 1664-1750).\r\n\r\n      One of the few female painters represented in the Gallery.\r\n      Rachel Ruysch was the daughter of a professor of anatomy, and\r\n      began to study art at an early age. She married Julian Pool,\r\n      a portrait-painter, and had a large family. She continued the\r\n      practice of her art until she reached an advanced age, always\r\n      signing her pictures with her maiden name. Notwithstanding\r\n      her industry, the number of her pictures is somewhat small,\r\n      and it was jokingly said in her time that \"she produced more\r\n      children than pictures.\" The labour she devoted to her work was\r\n      astonishing; two pictures alone are said to have occupied her\r\n      for seven years; and these she bestowed on one of her daughters\r\n      as a marriage portion. She was admirable in her manner of\r\n      grouping as well as in pencilling; each flower is relieved by\r\n      its neighbour, and all are kept in perfect harmony. She was\r\n      fond of introducing among her flowers the insects peculiar to\r\n      them (notice the butterfly in 1446); and these she depicted\r\n      with microscopic accuracy. \"Had her colouring been less cold,\r\n      she would certainly have equalled her illustrious rival, Van\r\n      Huysum\" (Bryan's _Dictionary of Painters_, and Havard's _Dutch\r\n      School_, p. 268).\r\n\r\n\r\n1447. A HUNTING PARTY.\r\n\r\n  _Adam Frans van der Meulen_ (Flemish: 1632-1694).\r\n\r\n      This painter, a native of Brussels, had a great facility\r\n      in battlepieces. Some of these found their way to France,\r\n      and attracted the notice of the painter Le Brun. On his\r\n      recommendation Van der Meulen was invited to the French\r\n      Court, and was at first employed on designs for the Gobelins\r\n      tapestries. Afterwards he accompanied Louis XIV. on his\r\n      campaigns, and, brush in hand, was present at all the principal\r\n      sieges and battles of that monarch. These he afterwards\r\n      painted for the King; he also depicted many hunting scenes\r\n      and cavalcades. His works are to be seen at the Louvre and\r\n      Versailles.\r\n\r\nThe present picture (signed, and dated 1662) shows us some such scene\r\nin the life of the Court. The suite is bareheaded, and it is clearly\r\nsome personage of importance--possibly Louis XIV. himself--who is\r\nseated at the window of the carriage. The background of open country\r\nwith blue distance is very pleasantly rendered.\r\n\r\n\r\n1448. A VILLAGE GREEN IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\n  _François S. Bonvin_ (French: 1817-1888).\r\n\r\n      A painter of still life and interiors as well as of landscape;\r\n      for thirty years a constant exhibitor at the Salon; given the\r\n      Order of the Legion of Honour in 1870.\r\n\r\nSigned, and dated 1869, at Verberie--a pleasantly-situated spot in the\r\ndepartment of the Oise, eleven miles north-east of Senlis.\r\n\r\n\r\n1449. CARDINAL RICHELIEU.\r\n\r\n  _Philippe de Champaigne_ (French: 1602-1674). _See 798._\r\n\r\n\"The central head in No. 798 was evidently used as a study for this\r\nportrait. The Cardinal, in the crimson silk robes of his office, with\r\nthe cross of the Order of St. Louis hung by a blue ribbon round his\r\nneck, stands as if just risen from the chair of state behind him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1450. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Sebastiano del Piombo_ (Venetian: 1485-1547). _See 1._\r\n\r\n\"In the mixture of the Venetian element,\" it has been said, \"with\r\nthe severe forms and masses of the Michelangelesque feeling consists\r\nthe charm of Sebastiano's best works\" (Layard, ii. 562). The \"superb\r\ncomposition\" before us, says Sir Edward Poynter, \"shows the influence\r\nof Michelangelo in every line.\" It was formerly in the collection\r\nof the late Mr. Thomas Baring, and was purchased from the Earl of\r\nNorthbrook in 1895. It was Mr. Baring's favourite picture in his\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n1451. INTERIOR OF A CHURCH.\r\n\r\n  _Gerrit Berck-Heyde_ (Dutch: 1638-1698). _See 1420._\r\n\r\nThe nave of a Gothic church in Holland, during sermon-time (the\r\npreacher is in the pulpit against one of the columns on the right).\r\nThe women sit on chairs; the men in seats raised in tiers. Some stand\r\nlistening to the sermon, and an elderly man on the left is warning\r\ntwo children to be quiet. In the centre a boy is playing with a dog,\r\nto which a woman directs the attention of the child with her. On the\r\npavement is the artist's signature, dated 1673.\r\n\r\n\r\n1454. A GONDOLA.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Guardi_ (Venetian: 1712-1793). _See 210._\r\n\r\n\r\n1455. THE CIRCUMCISION.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_ (Venetian: 1426-1516). _See 189._\r\n\r\nA picture of Bellini's earlier period, the original of numerous\r\nversions and copies in private and public galleries, presented to the\r\nNational Gallery by one of the trustees, the Earl of Carlisle. The\r\nVirgin is \"one of those magnificent Venetian women whose _morbidezza_\r\nprofoundly moved the painters of their country, marked by a grave,\r\nsuave, and restful expression, instinct with unconscious dignity; this\r\nis the countenance of a Venetian woman to the life, not over refined,\r\nbut full of repose, the repose of vigour and conscious strength,\r\nnot the languor of debility\" (_Athenæum_). The diaper of the High\r\nPriest's robe contains figures of antelopes, a curious instance of the\r\nstraightforward mode of the artist, who, no doubt, employed as a model\r\na veritable robe, and one of Oriental or Sicilian origin. Embroideries\r\nof this category were frequently used in Venice of old. The same\r\nOriental embroidery is to be seen in pictures by other Venetian artists\r\nin which the High Priest is introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n1456. VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Italian School: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nBelow is a portion of the original frame with three small quatrefoil\r\nmedallions in which are half-length figures of the Saviour, the Virgin,\r\nand St. John. The picture, which was presented to the Gallery by one of\r\nthe trustees, Mr. J.P. Heseltine, is ascribed to the school of Gentile\r\nda Fabriano (about 1360-1440), \"the Umbrian Fra Angelico,\" whose\r\ndelight in splendour and gold ornaments is so naïve.\r\n\r\n\r\n1457. CHRIST DRIVING THE TRADERS OUT OF THE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Theotocopuli_ (Spanish: 1548-1625). _See 1122._\r\n\r\n\r\n1459. THE WINE CONTRACT.\r\n\r\n  _Gerhard van den Eeckhout_ (Dutch: 1621-1674).\r\n\r\n      This painter, the son of a goldsmith at Amsterdam, was one\r\n      of the first to enter Rembrandt's school. He was a favourite\r\n      pupil, and lived in close intimacy with the master. His\r\n      biblical subjects--examples of which are at the Louvre, the\r\n      Hague, and Amsterdam--were painted in close imitation of\r\n      Rembrandt. He owed to his master not only his subjects, but\r\n      their figures, costumes, and attitudes; he could not, however,\r\n      borrow Rembrandt's warmth and intensity. His portraits are more\r\n      successful.\r\n\r\nA group of the four chiefs of the Wine Guild of Amsterdam seated in\r\nconversation over some deeds. The picture is signed, and dated 1657.\r\n\r\n\r\n1461. ST. SEBASTIAN.\r\n\r\n  _Matteo di Giovanni_ (Sienese: 1435-1495). _See 1155._\r\n\r\nThis and No. 247 by the same artist are, says Sir Edward Poynter,\r\n\"excellent examples of _tempera_ painting of the fifteenth century,\r\nin good preservation and unvarnished.\" The panel is surrounded by the\r\noriginal gilt mouldings.\r\n\r\n\r\n1462. SEA-PIECE WITH SHIPPING.\r\n\r\n  _Hendrik Dubbels_ (Dutch: 1620-1676).\r\n\r\n      This painter, \"the master of Bakhuizen (see under 204), was one\r\n      of the first, after the success of his pupil was confirmed, to\r\n      adopt his subjects and to copy his manner\" (Havard: _The Dutch\r\n      School_, p. 256). His works, however, bear little resemblance\r\n      to Bakhuizen's: they are more like Van de Cappelle. Many of his\r\n      pictures are to be found in private collections. The present\r\n      picture, with its luminous atmospheric effects, is an excellent\r\n      example. Observe on the leeboard of one of the barges the\r\n      signature, I. H. D., possibly Jan Hendrik Dubbels. There were\r\n      three painters of the name, Hendrik, Dirk, and Jan.\r\n\r\n\r\n1465. CHRIST RISING FROM THE TOMB.\r\n\r\n  _Gaudenzio Ferrari_ (Lombard: 1481-1549).\r\n\r\n      A welcome addition to the Gallery, as being the work\r\n      (though not a specially important work) of a great and most\r\n      indefatigable painter not previously represented. Gaudenzio\r\n      was a native of Valduggia (in the Val Sesia); his father was\r\n      a painter; his mother's surname was Vinzio, and in his early\r\n      work he often signed his pictures after her, \"Gaudentius\r\n      Vincius.\" He passed his life exclusively in Piedmont and\r\n      Lombardy, where nearly all his works are still to be found--at\r\n      Vercelli, Novara, Saronno, and Milan. The most important of\r\n      them are at Varallo, on the Sacro Monte and in the church at\r\n      its foot. In some of the chapels on the Sacro Monte he not only\r\n      painted the frescoes in the background but also executed the\r\n      terra-cotta figures, thus carrying out the scheme of uniting\r\n      painting and sculpture in a single design. His \"Crucifixion\r\n      Chapel,\" the most important of his works in this kind, has on\r\n      this account been described as \"the most daring among Italian\r\n      works of art.\" Gaudenzio, who was nearly contemporary with\r\n      Luini, first studied at Milan in the school of Stefano Scotto\r\n      (whose portrait he is believed to have introduced more than\r\n      once in his work at Varallo). The story that he visited Rome\r\n      and made the acquaintance of Raphael rests on no authority,\r\n      and probably arose from a certain similarity in his works to\r\n      the charm of Raphael. But this is a similarity, not of what is\r\n      called \"influence,\" but of age and temperament. \"The influence\r\n      of Perugino or of Raphael,\" says Morelli, \"is not more and\r\n      not less perceptible in Ferrari's paintings than in those of\r\n      nearly all the great masters of that happy period, generally\r\n      called the golden age of Italian art, during which Gaudenzio\r\n      and Luini held much the same place in their own school as\r\n      Raphael does in the Umbrian, Cavazzola (Morando) and Carotto\r\n      in the Veronese, Garofalo and Dosso in the Ferrarese, and Fra\r\n      Bartolommeo and Andrea del Sarto in the Florentine. Gaudenzio,\r\n      it is true, has not the grace of Luini, neither are his works\r\n      so perfect in execution as those of his rival; but take him\r\n      for all in all, as regards inventive genius, dramatic life,\r\n      and picturesqueness, he stands far above Luini. In his hot\r\n      haste Ferrari often loses his balance, and becomes quaint and\r\n      affected; many of his larger compositions, too, are overcrowded\r\n      with figures; but in his best works he is inferior to very few\r\n      of his contemporaries, and occasionally, as in some of those\r\n      groups of men and women in the great 'Crucifixion' at Varallo,\r\n      he might challenge a comparison with Raphael himself\" (_German\r\n      Galleries_, p. 441). The best and fullest account of Gaudenzio,\r\n      in English, is to be found in Mr. Samuel Butler's interesting\r\n      work on Varallo, entitled _Ex Voto_ (Trübner, 1888).\r\n\r\nChrist, holding the resurrection banner in His hand, rises from a\r\nmarble tomb. The painter, who was a child of the mountains, gives us a\r\nbackground of blue hills. The picture was the centre compartment of an\r\naltar-piece in a church at Magianico, near Lecco, on the Lake of Como.\r\nThis composition was copied with variations by Gaudenzio's follower\r\nGiuseppe Giovenone in a picture now at Turin.\r\n\r\n\r\n1466. THE WALK TO EMMAUS.\r\n\r\n  _Lelio Orsi_ (Parmese: 1511-1586).\r\n\r\n      This painter, highly esteemed in his own day and of\r\n      considerable talent, has remained less known than many others\r\n      of inferior merit--a fact which is due, as Lanzi observes\r\n      (ii. 357), to his having divided his time between Reggio and\r\n      Novellara, comparatively obscure towns in the Emilia. He was\r\n      born at Reggio, and was much employed there by the Gonzagi. He\r\n      is supposed to have been a pupil of Correggio, whose works he\r\n      is known to have copied, and of whom he was a personal friend.\r\n      In 1546 he was banished for some unknown offence, and was not\r\n      permitted to return to Reggio till 1552. During these years\r\n      he settled at Novellara, where again he was employed by the\r\n      Gonzagas. He must also have visited Rome, and studied the works\r\n      of Michael Angelo. Most of Orsi's frescoes have perished. Some\r\n      of his pictures are in the Gallery at Modena. He was celebrated\r\n      in his day no less as an architect than as a painter.\r\n\r\nThere is an element of picturesqueness and almost modern romanticism in\r\nthis picture. Christ and the disciples wear broad-brimmed hats and the\r\ndress of Italian peasants (_cf._ No. 753).\r\n\r\n\r\n1468. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _Spinello Aretino_ (Tuscan: about 1333-1410). _See 581._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\nA picture, some 500 years old, in excellent preservation, retaining\r\nits bright colours and the varied expressions of the faces. It is in\r\nits original frame, surmounted by a Gothic canopy. Two upright panels\r\non each side contain figures of St. John the Baptist and St. Paul\r\n(left), St. James the Greater and St. Bartholomew (right). In circular\r\nmedallions below are the Virgin and Child, with saints.\r\n\r\n\r\n1469. STILL LIFE.\r\n\r\n  _W. K. Heda_ (Dutch: 1594-1678)\r\n\r\n      One of the painters \"of the kitchen and dining-room--painters\r\n      who devoted themselves to painting copper and silver vessels,\r\n      pottery, and porcelain, modest saucepans, crystal cups, glass\r\n      bowls, and goblets of chased silver. The first to cultivate\r\n      this new style of still life was Willem Klaasz Heda. He was\r\n      born at Haarlem. He was a clever and careful painter, and must\r\n      have left behind him a considerable number of works; but,\r\n      nevertheless, his pictures are excessively rare. They generally\r\n      consist of a carved silver cup, a plate, and a cut lemon--three\r\n      subjects which the painter rendered with marvellous\r\n      truthfulness, the whole surrounded by a few accessories rising\r\n      out of a brown background\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_, p. 272).\r\n\r\n\r\n1470. A BATTLE SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _J. Weier_ (German: 17th Century).\r\n\r\n      This picture is signed I. Weier, and dated 1645. It may be\r\n      either by Jacob Weier, of Hamburg, who died in 1670; or by\r\n      Johann Matthias Weier, of the same town, who was a pupil of\r\n      Wouwerman, and died, a very old man, in 1690.\r\n\r\n\r\n1471. THE PICNIC (\"MARIENDA CAMPESTRE\").\r\n\r\n  _Francisco Goya_ (Spanish: 1746-1828).\r\n\r\n      This painter--of greater genius and of a more national spirit,\r\n      says Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, than any his century\r\n      produced--was the son of humble parents. Until the age of 16\r\n      he lived without any knowledge of art, when his passion for\r\n      painting was awakened by a monk of Santa Fé, near Saragossa,\r\n      after which he was admitted into the studio of José Luxan\r\n      Martinez, who had been educated in Italy. He distinguished\r\n      himself at this time, not so much in the studio as in the\r\n      streets, in the quarrels of painters and confraternities,\r\n      sometimes ending in bloodshed. At Madrid, to which city he\r\n      afterwards escaped, his mode of life appears to have been\r\n      anything but that of an orderly citizen. Being a good musician,\r\n      and gifted with a voice, he sallied forth nightly, serenading\r\n      the caged beauties of the capital, with whom he seems to have\r\n      been a general favourite, and whose portraits he painted. In\r\n      consequence of a street brawl in Madrid he fled to Italy, in\r\n      company with a party of bull-fighters, and resided at Rome,\r\n      where he fraternised with Louis David. In 1774 he returned\r\n      to Spain, married, and settled down to his profession. He\r\n      soon attracted the notice of Mengs, the King's painter, by\r\n      some designs which he executed for the royal manufactory of\r\n      tapestry, and became a popular artist of that capital, and a\r\n      prime favourite with its fashionable society. In 1789 he was\r\n      appointed painter-in-ordinary to Charles IV., a post which\r\n      he continued to hold under Ferdinand VII. He was so largely\r\n      employed that he was able to maintain a fine villa near Madrid,\r\n      where he entertained in the grand style. Among distinguished\r\n      persons who sat to him was the Duke of Wellington, but on his\r\n      making a remark which raised the artist's choler, Goya seized\r\n      a plaster cast and hurled it at the Duke's head. The artist's\r\n      declining years were spent in retirement at Bordeaux, where he\r\n      died at the age of 82.\r\n\r\n      \"Goya's earlier life indicated,\" says W. B. Scott, \"the\r\n      character of his painting--bizarre and wild, with a gleam of\r\n      infernal splendour in his choice of beauty. He was an inventor,\r\n      and gives us the most vivid and novel sensations, although\r\n      he serves us with vinegar as well as wine.\" \"Much that was\r\n      bizarre and tumultuous, the strangeness of charm, a certain\r\n      curious and sombre side of beauty, the sense of the strength\r\n      of a personality, the reflection of extravagant gaiety, or\r\n      excessive horror, Goya was able to render in a manner that had\r\n      never been seen before\" (_Goya_, by W. Rothenstein: 1900). He\r\n      was in no way the slave to the technicalities of the studio\r\n      or academical rules. In sacred subjects, which he painted\r\n      by no means _con amore_, he affects the hard style of David\r\n      and his French followers. But it was otherwise in those more\r\n      congenial works in which his hand spoke as his fancy prompted,\r\n      and in which he poured forth the gaiety of his art or the gall\r\n      of his sarcasm. There the daubing boldness of the execution\r\n      rivals the coarseness of the idea or the rudeness of the jest.\r\n      His colours were laid on as often with sticks, sponges, or\r\n      dish-clouts as with the brush. \"Smearing his canvas with\r\n      paint,\" says Gautier of him, \"as a mason plasters a wall, he\r\n      would add the delicate touches of sentiment with a dash of\r\n      his thumb.\" So dexterous was he in turning all materials to\r\n      artistic account that during morning visits to his friends he\r\n      would take the sandbox from the inkstand, and, strewing the\r\n      contents on the table, amuse them with caricatures traced in\r\n      an instant by his ready finger. His versatility is proverbial;\r\n      in addition to numerous oil paintings he executed many crayon\r\n      sketches, engravings, and etchings. It is by the latter that he\r\n      is perhaps best known. \"The Caprices\" are the most surprising,\r\n      showing humanity in all the stages of brutality and ugliness,\r\n      with a _mélange_ of beauty and demonology quite unexampled.\r\n      (W.B. Scott, _The Spanish School_; Bryan's _Dictionary of\r\n      Painters_; and Stirling-Maxwell, _Annals of the Artists of\r\n      Spain_.) The three following pictures are representative of\r\n      Goya's several styles--scenes of country life, demoniacal\r\n      fancies, and portraiture.\r\n\r\nFrom the collection of the Duke of Ossuna at Madrid. Théophile Gautier\r\ndescribed Goya--in the language of hyperbole--as \"a combination of\r\nWatteau and Rembrandt,\" and in this picture we have a Watteau-like\r\nsubject, treated, however, in a more grotesque fashion than that of the\r\ncharming French painter of rural _fêtes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1472. \"THE BEWITCHED.\"\r\n\r\n  _Francisco Goya_ (Spanish: 1746-1828). _See 1471._\r\n\r\nA scene from a play (\"El hechizado por fuerza\"), showing a player on\r\nthe stage, dressed as a padre in complete black, and in the act of\r\npouring oil into a lamp which is held by an obsequious demon, while a\r\nteam of ghostly and affrighted mules are rearing in the background.\r\nGoya, who has been called the Hogarth of Spain, specially delighted in\r\nsatirising the clergy, whose enchantments and incantations he parodied,\r\nand whom he was fond of portraying in the form of asses or apes.\r\n\r\n\r\n1473. PORTRAIT OF DOÑA ISABEL CORBO DE PORCEL.\r\n\r\n  _Francisco Goya_ (Spanish: 1746-1828). _See 1471._\r\n\r\n\"The lady was evidently a plump and rosy voluptuous woman, having\r\nlarge and liquid eyes with much dilated pupils, as well as coarse\r\nand full lips, and wearing her loose brown tresses about her eyes\r\nand ears, while a black mantilla fell from a lofty comb upon her\r\nshoulders. It is obvious--and this accounts for the lady's flushed\r\ncarnations and glittering pupils, not frequent elements in Goya's\r\nwork--that she prepared herself for sitting, not only by blacking her\r\neyelids with kohl, but using belladonna to dilate her eyes, and rouge\r\nfor her cheeks\" (_Athenæum_, July 4, 1896). This portrait, says Sir\r\nEdward Poynter, \"is perhaps as good an example as could be found of\r\nthe brilliancy of execution and vivid portrayal of character which\r\ncharacterise Goya at his best.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1476. JUPITER AND SEMELE.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Schiavone_ (Venetian: 1522-1582).\r\n\r\n      Andrea Meldolla, called Il Schiavone (from his birthplace in\r\n      Dalmatia, the country of the Slaves), was born of poor parents,\r\n      and died, we are told, \"after a life of much suffering as\r\n      well as labour\"--his works, by which the dealers enriched\r\n      themselves, barely supplying him with the means of existence.\r\n      He was employed at very small remuneration to paint the outside\r\n      of houses and panels for furniture. It is said that he was\r\n      rescued from obscurity by Titian. He was a good colourist, and\r\n      had considerable imagination. \"The colouring of Schiavone,\"\r\n      says Zanetti, \"was much admired by Tintoret, who kept a\r\n      painting by that artist in his studio and advised others to\r\n      do the same.\" Among the illustrious painters who followed\r\n      Tintoret's advice was our own Lord Leighton, from whose\r\n      collection the present picture was bought.\r\n\r\nThe picture illustrates the myth which told how Jupiter came to Semele,\r\nwhom he loved, attended by clouds, lightning, and thunderbolts. This\r\npanel was doubtless painted, as described above, for some piece of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n1478. THE CRUCIFIXION.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Mansueti_ (Venetian: born about 1450).\r\n\r\n      Of the life of this painter little is known. The registers of\r\n      San Giovanni, Venice, tell us that he was lame; and by his own\r\n      authority we learn that he was a pupil of Giovanni Bellini,\r\n      and a believer in the miracle of the Cross, which took place\r\n      in 1474, and forms the subject of a picture by him, now in\r\n      the Academy of Venice. His pictures in that collection are\r\n      interesting as illustrating Venetian costume and architecture,\r\n      and Ruskin finds \"much that is delightful in them.\" Mansueti's\r\n      figures, says Kugler (i. 332), are short and stumpy, and he\r\n      lacks the variety of expression and action of Gentile Bellini,\r\n      and the brilliancy of colour and fancy of Carpaccio.\r\n\r\nThis picture--which is not a very ambitious or characteristic\r\nillustration of the painter--gives a symbolic representation of the\r\nCrucifixion. \"In front of an architectural screen--on the right and\r\nleft of which is an open tabernacle in sculptured stone, enclosing,\r\ninstead of the usual statue of the Virgin or a saint, an angel singing,\r\nand holding an instrument of the Passion of our Saviour--lie the spear,\r\nand the sponge upon the reed. Between these is a Majesty of the usual\r\ntype, the flesh of the Redeemer being, doubtless owing to the partial\r\nfading of the carnations or the fact of the under-paint coming through,\r\nmore greenish and opaque than the Venetian artists, especially the\r\nschool of Bellini, affected. At the foot of the group the Magdalen\r\nkneels in the act of kissing the Saviour's feet. On her left stands the\r\nVirgin, and on the same side are two men, representing, of course, the\r\nMagi and the shepherds who attended the nativity of our Lord. On our\r\nright stand SS. John the Baptist and Peter, in front of whom kneels a\r\nman who holds the pincers as an implement of the Passion. The picture,\r\nas becomes its origin, is bright in colour as well as in its effect and\r\nlocal tints, very carefully and almost laboriously as well as timidly\r\ndrawn; the architecture would not discredit Peter Neeffs\" (_Athenæum_,\r\n24th October 1896). The picture is signed, and dated 1492.\r\n\r\n\r\n1479. A WINTER SCENE ON THE ICE.\r\n\r\n  _Hendrik van Avercamp_ (Dutch: 1586-1663). _See 1346._\r\n\r\nA winter scene such as Mr. Pater describes in his _Imaginary Portraits_\r\n(p. 91), with \"all the delicate poetry together with all the delicate\r\ncomfort of the frosty season,\" in \"the leafless branches, the furred\r\ndresses of the skaters, the warmth of the red-brick house fronts, and\r\nthe gleam of pale sunlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1481. A PHILOSOPHER.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelis Pietersz Bega_ (Dutch: 1620-1664).\r\n\r\n      This painter, who lived and died at Haarlem, was the son of\r\n      a sculptor and a pupil of Adrian van Ostade. \"Though,\" says\r\n      Havard (p. 148), \"a more finished draughtsman, with more\r\n      regard for grace of form and for the beauty of his figures,\r\n      in all other respects he was very inferior to Ostade. When we\r\n      notice his dry and heavy execution, his ruddy flesh-colouring,\r\n      and his opaque shadows, we are surprised that he should have so\r\n      far neglected the examples placed before him.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture, executed throughout with extreme care and finish, is\r\nsigned, and dated 1663.\r\n\r\n\r\n1489, 1490. PORTRAITS OF VENETIAN SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  (_Venetian School_: 16th Century.)\r\n\r\nTransferred from the South Kensington Museum, where the portraits were\r\nattributed to Tintoret.\r\n\r\n\r\n1493. LANDSCAPE, WITH VIEW OF THE CARRARA MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n  _G. Costa_ (Italian: born 1826).\r\n\r\n      Giovanni Costa, Professor in the Florentine Academy of Fine\r\n      Arts, is distinguished alike as a painter and a patriot. He\r\n      fought in the Venetian campaign of 1848, was a follower of\r\n      Mazzini, in 1853 joined the Piedmontese regiment of lancers\r\n      known as the Aosta Cavalleggieri, served on Garibaldi's staff\r\n      at Mentana, and in 1870 fought his way through the streets\r\n      of Rome at the head of the Italian army, and was the first\r\n      to enter the Capitol. This ended his military career; but\r\n      he afterwards served on the Municipal Council of Rome and\r\n      interested himself specially in the prevention of inundations\r\n      of the Tiber. It was in 1852 that Costa first began the study\r\n      of landscape painting, in which he was destined to become the\r\n      greatest ornament of the modern Italian School. His home was\r\n      in the Alban Hills, near Rome, and afterwards at Florence,\r\n      where in 1859 he inaugurated the \"open-air school\" in Italy.\r\n      In 1864 he returned to Rome, and in 1870 was appointed to\r\n      his professorship at Florence. In the earlier portion of\r\n      his artistic career, Costa exhibited at Paris (with Corot,\r\n      Troyon, and others); afterwards he found in England his chief\r\n      patrons, and many of his pupils. In 1853, at Rome, he made the\r\n      acquaintance of Leighton, whose intimate friend he remained\r\n      until the President's death. Another celebrated English artist\r\n      with whom Costa was intimate was Mason; there is considerable\r\n      affinity in some respects between the work of the two men.\r\n      The Italian painter has depicted almost every part of his\r\n      beautiful country. He has been called \"the Italian Millet,\"\r\n      for the feeling of sublimity which he knows so well how to\r\n      impart to the simplicities of peasant life; while in works\r\n      of pure landscape he especially excels in giving to blue\r\n      mountains, reedy banks, and olive-grown shores a poetical\r\n      charm. (See an interesting account of Professor Costa,\r\n      largely autobiographical, in the _Magazine of Art_, vol. vi.\r\n      His personal reminiscences of Mason and Leighton have been\r\n      published in the _Cornhill Magazine_, March 1897.)\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the Carrara Mountains is a favourite subject of the\r\npainter. In his pictures of these mountains, \"seen across a broad\r\nexpanse of plain through a misty atmosphere, he invests forms\r\nundeniably grand in themselves with a more solemn splendour and a\r\ndeepened poetry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1495. CHRIST DISPUTING WITH THE DOCTORS.\r\n\r\n  _Ludovico Mazzolino_ (Ferrarese: 1480-1528). _See 169._\r\n\r\nThis brilliant and characteristic little picture, containing\r\ntwenty-eight delicately and elaborately finished figures, is enriched\r\nwith one of Mazzolino's usual backgrounds of marble bas-reliefs. The\r\nlower of them represents Moses showing the Tables of the Law to the\r\nIsraelites. The upper, the battle between the Israelites and the\r\nPhilistines, with David beheading Goliath.\r\n\r\n\r\n1653. PORTRAIT OF HERSELF.\r\n\r\n  _Madame Vigée Le Brun_ (French: 1755-1842).\r\n\r\n      All visitors to Paris know this charming artist. Her two\r\n      portraits of herself with her little girl in her arms are in\r\n      the Louvre, and engravings or photographs of them are in every\r\n      printseller's window. They are characteristic of her refined\r\n      drawing, her limpid and transparent colour, her graceful\r\n      sentiment. She excelled in rendering the candour of innocence,\r\n      the charm of childhood, and maternal tenderness. She aimed\r\n      rather at a certain ideal of soft and smiling beauty than at\r\n      realism of portraiture. Some of her personages, even those in\r\n      the highest ranks of life, seem, it has been well said, to\r\n      have traversed the sentimental scenes of the tender Greuze,\r\n      and she was fond of enveloping her sitters in semi-allegorical\r\n      surroundings. If she cannot be reckoned among the great\r\n      portrait-painters, she yet shows a power which is rare among\r\n      artists of her sex, and a charming style of her own which will\r\n      always make her works attractive. Madame le Brun was herself\r\n      one of the most beautiful and accomplished women of her time.\r\n      Elizabeth Louise Vigée was born in Paris, and her early years\r\n      were spent in the studio of her father, who was a painter, and\r\n      among other artistic surroundings. Her own talents rapidly\r\n      developed; by the time she was 15 she had many commissions,\r\n      and at 20 she was already celebrated. Her beauty and social\r\n      charm soon gained for her the friendship of the greatest men\r\n      and women of the day, including La Harpe, D'Alembert, and\r\n      Marie Antoinette. With the Queen she was a great favourite.\r\n      She painted her portrait in 1779, and afterwards no less than\r\n      thirty times. She was made a member of the Royal Academy of\r\n      Painting in 1780, but when the Revolution broke out she left\r\n      Paris in haste. She went from capital to capital; in each\r\n      in turn the charm of her person and manner made her many\r\n      friends, and she was always full of commissions. In 1795 she\r\n      settled for some years at St. Petersburg, where she enjoyed\r\n      the favour of the Imperial Court. In 1802 she came for three\r\n      years to England, where she painted portraits of the Prince\r\n      of Wales and Lord Byron, among others. She was a favourite\r\n      wherever she went, but in spite of all the adulation she\r\n      received she remained simple and natural to the end. When she\r\n      returned to Paris, her salon became the rendezvous of the\r\n      most distinguished writers, painters, and politicians of that\r\n      brilliant period, and her _Souvenirs_, published in 1837, are\r\n      crowded with interesting sketches of her friends. In this frank\r\n      and engaging autobiography she gives us particulars of the\r\n      worthless husband--M. Le Brun, a picture-dealer whom she had\r\n      married when she was 20. He squandered her fortune, but she\r\n      found unfailing consolation in the daughter whom she presses\r\n      to her in those portraits in the Louvre. She outlived both her\r\n      daughter and her husband by many years and died at the age of\r\n      87.\r\n\r\nThis portrait was painted by the artist in her 27th year. Its\r\nacquisition for the National Gallery is specially interesting, for\r\nit was painted in emulation of the celebrated \"Chapeau de Paille\" of\r\nRubens (No. 852). She had seen and admired that work at Antwerp in\r\n1782, and determined to represent herself in a similar effect of shadow\r\nand reflected light. The portrait had so great a success that it gained\r\nher admission to the Académie, where she was received in the following\r\nyear, 1783.\r\n\r\n\r\n1660. PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian van der Werff_ (Dutch: 1659-1722).\r\n\r\n      \"The painter who by his astounding success did most after\r\n      Gerard de Lairesse to lead the art of painting into a\r\n      perverse path was Adrian van der Werff. He was born at\r\n      Kralinger-Ambacht, near Rotterdam, and received lessons in\r\n      drawing from Cornelis Picollet, and then entered the studio\r\n      of Eglon van der Neer, where he made rapid progress. At\r\n      first he seemed inclined to follow the bent of his master,\r\n      but he deserted the study of nature for the pursuit of the\r\n      ideal, and in doing so he fell into cold sentimentality and\r\n      tasteless affectation. His groups became pretentious, his heads\r\n      monotonous, his bodies have no life, and his flesh-colouring\r\n      assumes the polish and the tint of ivory. These defects,\r\n      however, did not prevent his misleading a certain number of\r\n      people who believed themselves to be connoisseurs. The Duke of\r\n      Wolfenbüttel and other high personages of his time contended\r\n      for the possession of his pictures at enormous prices, and\r\n      praised the merits of their favourite artist to the skies.\r\n      No one more assisted him in his career, and in the making of\r\n      his reputation, than the Elector-Palatine John William, who,\r\n      not satisfied with giving him very considerable commissions,\r\n      also conferred upon him the title of Chevalier, and ennobled\r\n      his family. (The artist signs himself on occasion 'Chevalier\r\n      van Werff'). The compositions which he painted for his patron\r\n      are now to be seen at Munich\" (Havard: _The Dutch School_, p.\r\n      280). There is in the Dulwich Gallery a \"Judgment of Paris\" by\r\n      Van der Werff--a celebrated work painted in 1718 for the Duke\r\n      of Orleans and much admired by Sir Joshua Reynolds. The heads\r\n      are wanting in expression and the flesh is bloodless, but the\r\n      painting is of the greatest finish. There are also pictures\r\n      by him in the Wallace Collection. \"The cold porcelain-like\r\n      colour,\" says Mr. Phillips in his catalogue, \"and mechanical\r\n      finish of this artist in the treatment of the nude are much\r\n      less appreciated by modern connoisseurs than they were by\r\n      his contemporaries. Still his general accomplishment and\r\n      the certainty of his execution, in a vicious and wholly\r\n      conventional style, are not to be denied.\"\r\n\r\nIn our picture \"the courtly painter of polished, lascivious nudities\r\nfaces the spectator in a wig of the period of Louis Quatorze, looking\r\nas dignified and impersonal as the painters of that particular age\r\ndid manage to look in their portraits.\" The statue of Fame, holding a\r\nwreath, is characteristic. The portrait is signed, and dated 1685.\r\n\r\n\r\n1661, 1662. WINGS OF THE ALTAR-PIECE, No. 1093.\r\n\r\n  _Ambrogio de Predis_ (Milanese: about 1450-1515).\r\n\r\n      This long-forgotten painter was rediscovered by Morelli in\r\n      1880, who claimed for him a considerable place in the Milanese\r\n      school. This claim has since been historically confirmed by the\r\n      document, referred to in the notes to No. 1093, showing that\r\n      Ambrogio de Predis was at work in Milan with Leonardo da Vinci,\r\n      employed as his assistant to paint the wings of the altar-piece\r\n      of which the central portion was the \"Vierge aux Rochers.\" By\r\n      a fortunate purchase these wings by Ambrogio now hang in our\r\n      Gallery, on either side of Leonardo's picture. Ambrogio's best\r\n      work was in portraiture, of which an example (one of the two\r\n      signed and dated by the artist) is also in our Gallery (No.\r\n      1665). Ambrogio and his brother Bernardino were sons of a\r\n      certain Lorenzo Preda of Milan. There is also a Cristoforo de\r\n      Predis, a miniaturist, one of whose miniatures (representing\r\n      Galeazzo Maria Sforza) is in the Wallace Collection, and it is\r\n      probable that from him Ambrogio received his first education in\r\n      art. In 1482 he was established as Court Painter to Ludovico\r\n      il Moro. In 1493 he accompanied Bianca Maria Sforza on the\r\n      occasion of her marriage to the Emperor Maximilian, but was\r\n      back again at Milan in 1494. In 1502 we find him at Innsbruck,\r\n      where he seems to have settled. In 1506 he designed some\r\n      tapestries for the Emperor, after which year nothing more is\r\n      known of him. In the Vienna Gallery is a signed portrait by him\r\n      of the Emperor, dated 1502, and to him Morelli ascribes the\r\n      celebrated profile portrait of Bianca Maria in the Ambrosiana\r\n      at Milan (there erroneously called Beatrice Sforza), hitherto\r\n      assigned to Leonardo. Among other portraits now ascribed to\r\n      Ambrogio are the \"Page\" in the Morelli Collection at Bergamo,\r\n      and \"Fr. Brivio\" in the Poldi Pezzoli Collection at Milan. De\r\n      Predis is \"a conscientious and careful painter, though his\r\n      drawing and modelling are often defective, particularly in the\r\n      representation of the hand.\" He \"seems to have been an artist\r\n      of some individuality, even after coming under Leonardo's\r\n      influence. He was by nature too much of a miniaturist to\r\n      concern himself with the larger problems of painting, and was\r\n      very limited in his range--even his portraits are uniformly\r\n      treated. He seems, judging by his drawings, to have sought\r\n      to improve himself by a careful and conscientious study of\r\n      Leonardo's work, and when he had the advantage of the master's\r\n      guiding hand he could produce works (like these angels) one\r\n      of which, though lacking the qualities of profound art, has\r\n      a certain charm and even dignity of its own\" (_Catalogue of\r\n      Milanese Pictures_ at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1898,\r\n      p. li.; Morelli's _German Galleries_, pp. 413-415; _Roman\r\n      Galleries_, pp. 180-189).\r\n\r\nThe angel in 1661 may, as suggested above, have been designed, or\r\nbegun, by Leonardo himself; that in 1662 must be entirely the work of\r\nAmbrogio. These paintings remained in their place, as we have seen\r\nunder 1093, up to 1787. They were purchased in 1878 from Duke Jean\r\nMelzi d'Erie at Milan for £2160.\r\n\r\n\r\n1664. \"LA FONTAINE.\"\r\n\r\n  _J. B. S. Chardin_ (French: 1699-1779). _See 1258._\r\n\r\nThe woman is drawing water from a copper \"fontaine\" into a black jug.\r\n\r\n\r\n1665. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Ambrogio de Predis_ (Milanese: about 1450-1515). _See 1661._\r\n\r\nIn his right hand he holds a scroll which bears the painter's signature\r\nAM. PR., the date 1494, and the words AN. 20. Formerly in the\r\npossession of the Archinti family, and supposed to represent Francesco\r\ndi Bartolommeo Archinto (1474-1551), who was Governor of Chiavenna. A\r\nvery refined portrait; but Morelli points out that the hand is \"coarse\r\nand wanting in life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1674. A BURGOMASTER.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See 45._\r\n\r\n\"The costume and rapid execution of this magnificent picture point\r\nrather,\" says Sir Edward Poynter, \"to its being a study than a portrait\r\npainted on commission.\" Probably also the title by which the picture\r\nhas long been known is a mistake: a Burgomaster would not be painted\r\nin such dingy and fantastic garb. The old man was no doubt a model\r\ndressed up by Rembrandt in studio \"properties.\" The knotted stick which\r\nhe holds in his hands may be recognised in the painter's portrait\r\nof himself in Lord Ilchester's possession (No. 61 in the Academy\r\nExhibition of 1899). That portrait is dated 1658, and this picture\r\nprobably belongs to the same period. The picturesque but nondescript\r\nheadgear worn by the \"burgomaster\" may have belonged to the master\r\nhimself in those latter days when all relics of the former splendours\r\nhad vanished. Whoever he may have been, the \"Burgomaster,\" as he lives\r\nfor ever on Rembrandt's canvas, is a striking personage; the refined,\r\nintellectual face recalls to some spectators one of the late ornaments\r\nof the Episcopal Bench in our own day. The portrait is a masterpiece\r\nalike of character-reading and of modelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n1675. PORTRAIT OF AN OLD LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Rembrandt_ (Dutch: 1606-1669). _See 45._\r\n\r\nA noble portrait. Rembrandt was a painter who reverenced old age, and\r\ngave its dignity and beauty to faces the least promising. We may notice\r\nespecially the pathetic eyes,--with an expression at once so living\r\nand so sorrowful, and the character in the hands which Rembrandt never\r\nfailed to give his sitters. The old lady wears a large white ruff,\r\n\"evidently clinging to the costume of her earlier years, for ruffs had\r\nlong been out of fashion at the time when the picture was painted.\" The\r\npicture has been known as the Burgomaster's Wife, but this description\r\nis without authority or probability. There is another portrait of\r\nthe same old lady in Lord Wantage's possession (No. 15 in the Academy\r\nExhibition, 1899). Lord Wantage's picture is dated 1661.\r\n\r\nThe two magnificent pictures just described, which hold their own\r\ntriumphantly even on a wall of masterpieces,[251] were formerly in\r\npossession of Sir William Middleton, Bart., great-uncle to Lady de\r\nSaumarez, and were exhibited at the British Institution in 1858. Since\r\nthat date they had been lost to sight until they were purchased for\r\nthe National Gallery in 1899.[252] They are believed to have been in\r\npossession of the Lee family, Lady de Saumarez's ancestors, from the\r\ntime that they were painted, but they may have come into the family\r\nwith a certain John van Enkoren, a Dutch gentleman, who married a\r\nsecond cousin of Sir William Middleton.\r\n\r\n\r\n1676. CHRIST DISPUTING WITH THE DOCTORS.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco de Herrera, the elder_ (Spanish: 1576-1656).\r\n\r\n      Francesco de Herrera, the elder--so called to distinguish him\r\n      from a son of the same name who was also a painter--was the\r\n      first to throw off the timid conventional style hitherto in\r\n      vogue, and to adopt the bold and vigorous manner which became\r\n      characteristic of the school of Seville. He drew, we are told,\r\n      with charred reeds, and painted with a housepainter's brush. It\r\n      is said that on occasions he would employ a servant to smear\r\n      the paints on his canvas with a coarse brush, and then himself\r\n      shape the rough masses into figures and draperies. In the\r\n      Louvre there is an important picture by Herrera, \"St. Basil\r\n      dictating his Doctrine,\" of which Théophile Gautier said that\r\n      it was \"dashed off with an unimaginable fury of the brush, and\r\n      blazed with the flashing of some auto-da-fè.\" In the Earl of\r\n      Clarendon's Collection are three powerful pictures (shown at\r\n      the New Gallery, 1895-96) representing scenes in the life of\r\n      St. Bonaventura. But most of Herrera's extant works, in oil and\r\n      fresco, remain at Seville. The vigour of his style was equalled\r\n      by the impetuosity of his temper. Pupils flocked round him,\r\n      but the violence of his outbursts drove them away. Among this\r\n      number was Velazquez. He perverted his talent as an engraver\r\n      of medals to the work of coining, and when suspected of this\r\n      offence fled for sanctuary to the Jesuits' College. There he\r\n      painted a picture which was shown to Philip IV. \"What need,\"\r\n      said the King, \"has a man gifted with abilities like yours of\r\n      silver and gold? Go, you are free; and take care that you do\r\n      not get into this scrape again.\" He could not, however, change\r\n      his violent habits, and his children, we are told, robbed him\r\n      and fled from his house. In 1650 Herrera removed to Madrid,\r\n      where he had the pleasure, or mortification, of seeing his\r\n      former pupil, Velazquez, at the height of his fame.\r\n\r\nA work in the painter's less impetuous style, but marked by the vigour\r\ncharacteristic of the Spanish and Italian \"naturalists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1680. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Dutch School_ (17th Century).\r\n\r\nAn admirable portrait of a young man with long golden hair, looking\r\nout at the spectator. The picture is signed J. Karel du Jardin. It has\r\nsometimes been attributed to the well-known painter of that name (see\r\n826), and been said to be a portrait of the artist by himself. But the\r\ninitial J. does not confirm this theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n1682. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco di Giorgio_ (Sienese: 1439-1502).\r\n\r\n      Francesco di Giorgio Martini was one of the most distinguished\r\n      architects and engineers of his time. He wrote a treatise on\r\n      \"Civil and Military Architecture,\" and was a great authority,\r\n      says Vasari, on \"all instruments required for the purposes of\r\n      war.\" There are two altar-pieces by him in the Siena Academy,\r\n      and he also occasionally produced works in sculpture: \"this he\r\n      could do very conveniently, being a man of fair possessions as\r\n      well as of remarkable ability, wherefore he did not work for\r\n      the sake of gain, but for his own pleasure, and when he felt\r\n      inclined, to the end that he might leave honourable memorials\r\n      of his existence behind him.\"\r\n\r\n\"This quaint little picture represents the Virgin in the attitude of\r\nwalking, leading the Infant Saviour by the hand. She wears a white\r\ndress, shaded blue, with a small gold pattern delicately painted upon\r\nit, and a rose-coloured mantle lined with dark green, and holds in her\r\nright hand a branch of roses. The drapery falls with much grace, and\r\nshe looks down with a sweet expression to the Child\" (_National Gallery\r\nReport_, 1899).\r\n\r\n\r\n1683. STUDY OF A HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _Cuyp_ (Dutch: 1620-1691). _See 53._\r\n\r\nThe glossy texture of the horse is well rendered.\r\n\r\n\r\n1686. STUDY OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n  _Henri Fantin-Latour_ (French: 1836-1904).\r\n\r\n      Ignace Henri Jean Théodore Fantin-Latour was born at Grenoble,\r\n      the son of a famous pastellist. He first exhibited at the Salon\r\n      in 1861. In 1864 his \"Hommage à Delacroix\" created a sensation.\r\n      In this country, where he was a constant exhibitor at the Royal\r\n      Academy, he is best known for his exquisite studies of roses\r\n      and other flowers. But he was also a painter of portraits (see\r\n      No. 1952) and of romantic subjects inspired by his musical\r\n      tastes. In portraiture, a thorough, though a sympathetic,\r\n      realist (witness his \"Monet's studio at the Batignolles\" in the\r\n      Luxembourg),--he becomes fanciful when he enters the domain\r\n      of romance. A favourite medium was lithography, in which he\r\n      excelled; the British Museum has a fine set of proofs. His\r\n      subjects are taken from the motives used in the musical dramas\r\n      of Wagner and Berlioz.\r\n\r\nLate summer flowers, chiefly roses, in a vase on a wooden table. The\r\nbackground, as usual with this painter, is of a flat tone of warm gray.\r\n\r\n\r\n1689. A MAN AND WIFE.\r\n\r\n  _Mabuse_ (Flemish: about 1470-1541). _See 656._\r\n\r\nPortraits, uncompromising in thoroughness, of a severe and\r\nuncompromising couple. \"This masterpiece,\" says Sir Edward Poynter,\r\n\"combines with a high perfection of finish and modelling, every detail\r\nbeing finished with the utmost care, even to the stubble of the man's\r\nbeard, great breadth of effect and a beautiful quality of light and\r\nshade\" (_National Gallery Report_, 1900). The portraits, formerly\r\nin the collection of Captain A. F. Dawson, used to be attributed\r\nto Quentin Matsys. Some authorities ascribe them to his brother,\r\nJan. Others believe that the work belongs to the German school. The\r\nattribution to Mabuse is made in the Director's Report for 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n1694. VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n  _Fra Bartolommeo_ (Florentine: 1475-1517).\r\n\r\n      Bartolommeo di Pagholo del Fattorino, one of the greatest of\r\n      the Florentine masters, is commonly known as Baccio della\r\n      Porta, or Fra Bartolommeo. He was born at the village of\r\n      Savignano, near Prato, and was sent while still a lad to the\r\n      studio of Cosimo Rosselli at Florence, where he lived with\r\n      some kinsfolk in a house near the gate of San Piero Gattolini\r\n      (now the Porta Romana). The neighbours, seeing him come and\r\n      go to his work, and ignoring surnames with the custom of the\r\n      time, distinguished him from all the other Bartholemews as\r\n      Baccio della Porta. \"He was loved in Florence,\" says Vasari,\r\n      \"for his virtue, for he was very diligent at his work, quiet\r\n      and good-natured, fearing God, living a tranquil life, flying\r\n      all vicious practices, and taking great pleasure in preaching,\r\n      and the society of worthy and sober persons.\" In the studio of\r\n      Rosselli he made the acquaintance of Mariotto Albertinelli, as\r\n      erratic, gay, and idle as his companion was pure, gentle, and\r\n      austere. Between the two young men a warm friendship sprang\r\n      up, which continued unbroken till the death of Albertinelli\r\n      in 1515. When Fra Bartolommeo temporarily relinquished the\r\n      practice of art in 1500, Albertinelli took up his abandoned\r\n      canvases, and from 1509 onwards the two men worked in formal\r\n      partnership. The religious spirit of Bartolommeo had been\r\n      profoundly impressed by Savonarola's preaching. To the famous\r\n      bonfire, into which the people cast their pomps and vanities,\r\n      our painter brought all the studies and drawings which he had\r\n      made from the nude. He was among the band of faithful followers\r\n      who shut themselves up with Savonarola in San Marco. \"Having\r\n      very little courage,\" says Vasari, \"being indeed of a timid\r\n      and even cowardly disposition, he lost heart on hearing the\r\n      clamours of an attack, which was made upon the convent shortly\r\n      after, and seeing some wounded and others killed, he began to\r\n      have grievous doubts respecting his position. Thereupon he\r\n      made a vow, that if he might be permitted to escape from the\r\n      rage of that strife, he would instantly assume the religious\r\n      habit of the Dominicans.\" This he did in the year 1500, and\r\n      for some time afterwards his brush was idle. When he resumed\r\n      work, it was on condition that the convent received all the\r\n      produce of his labours. In 1506, when Raphael visited Florence,\r\n      he formed a friendship with Fra Bartolommeo, in whose work he\r\n      doubtless found something to assimilate. Some years afterwards,\r\n      Fra Bartolommeo went to Rome, where he painted a figure of\r\n      St. Paul, and part of one of St. Peter (now in the Quirinal),\r\n      leaving Raphael to finish the work. Fra Bartolommeo suffered\r\n      from ill-health, and died at the early age of 42.\r\n\r\n      The contributions made by Fra Bartolommeo to Italian art were\r\n      fourfold. He exhibited a scientific scheme of composition\r\n      based on principles of strict symmetry, and in this respect\r\n      he was the precursor of Raphael. In colouring he was equal\r\n      to the best of his contemporaries; in his better works\r\n      brilliance is combined with harmony of tone in a very charming\r\n      manner. In some of his works, however, the attempt to adopt\r\n      the chiaroscuro of Leonardo led to an over-darkening of\r\n      the shadows. Vasari noticed even in his day that the use\r\n      of printer's-black and ivory-black had caused some of Fra\r\n      Bartolommeo's shadows to become unduly heavy. In his landscape\r\n      backgrounds, Fra Bartolommeo showed a considerable advance on\r\n      his predecessors. \"Everything is true and harmonious, up to\r\n      its intention, which is to be simple, calm, consistent, and\r\n      real,--real, and yet breathing an idyllic beauty.\" Lastly, he\r\n      was the inventor of the \"lay figure.\" \"He always considered\r\n      it advisable,\" says Vasari, \"to have the living object before\r\n      him when he worked; and the better to execute his draperies,\r\n      arms, and things of similar kind, he caused a figure, the site\r\n      of life, to be made in wood, with the limbs moveable at the\r\n      joints, and on this he then arranged the real draperies.\"\r\n\r\n      Fra Bartolommeo's range was limited. He is seen at his best\r\n      not in works (such as the fresco of the \"Last Judgment,\" now\r\n      in the picture gallery of the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova)\r\n      which call for the exercise of powerful imagination, but in\r\n      Madonna pieces. \"Nature made Fra Bartolommeo,\" says Symonds,\r\n      \"the painter of adoration.\" He excels in the poetry of simple\r\n      religious feeling. His works are rare outside Italy. Copies\r\n      from some of his frescoes at Florence are in the Arundel\r\n      Society's Collection; but the treasure city of Fra Bartolommeo\r\n      at his best is Lucca. Few figures in Italian art have been more\r\n      often copied and photographed than his charming little angel\r\n      who sings at the foot of the Madonna's throne in the Cathedral\r\n      of Lucca.\r\n\r\nFra Bartolommeo's pictures \"sum up,\" says Ruskin, \"the principles of\r\ngreat Italian religious art in its finest period,--serenely luminous\r\nsky,--full light on the faces; local colour the dominant power over\r\na chiaroscuro more perfect because subordinate; absolute serenity of\r\nemotion and gesture; and rigid symmetry in composition.\" And elsewhere\r\nhe speaks of \"the precious and pure passages of intense feeling and\r\nheavenly light, holy and undefined, and glorious with the changeless\r\npassion of eternity, which sanctify with their shadeless peace the deep\r\nand noble conceptions of the early school of Italy--of Fra Bartolommeo,\r\nPerugino, and the early mind of Raffaelle\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i.\r\npt. ii. sec. ii. ch. i. § 22, and epilogue of 1883 to vol. ii.). Some\r\ntrace of these characteristics may be found in the present picture. It\r\nis bright in colour, balanced in composition, simple in feeling, and\r\nshows a charming Tuscan landscape. Thoroughly Tuscan also is the type\r\nof peasant Madonna, with her brown hair tied up in a blue handkerchief.\r\nThe infant Christ is almost grotesque, but the little St. John may\r\ntake his place among Fra Bartolommeo's collection of sweet child-faces.\r\nOur picture[253] is ascribed to the years 1507-9. In the Corsini\r\nGallery at Rome is a repetition of it done at a later period, with the\r\nfigures, life-sized, reversed, and with St. Joseph added to complete\r\nthe pyramidal composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n1695. LANDSCAPE WITH NYMPHS.\r\n\r\n  _Venetian School_ (early 16th Century).\r\n\r\nFrom the South Kensington Museum: very characteristic of the Venetian\r\nschool is the beautiful blue distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n1696. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Bellini_ (Venetian: 1426-1516). _See 189._\r\n\r\nA fragment of a fresco, painted in 1481 and originally brought from the\r\nchurch of Magre, near Schio, in the neighbourhood of Vicenza. The work,\r\nif by Bellini, is somewhat earlier than the \"Madonna and Child\" (280)\r\nof our Gallery.[254] \"We have,\" says Mr. Roger Fry, \"no example of\r\nBellini's fresco work by which to judge it. It may therefore be argued\r\nthat the weak construction of the Virgin's figure and the poor drawing\r\nof the child are the result of Bellini's want of familiarity with the\r\nmedium, nor can it be denied that the weaknesses are exaggerations of\r\ncertain peculiarities of Bellini's own design. This is particularly\r\nnoticeable in the drawing of the child, which approaches very nearly\r\nin type and expression the child of the 'Madonna between the Magdalen\r\nand St. Catherine' of the Academy at Venice. But in no undoubted work\r\nby Bellini is the drawing so clumsy as this. Much, however, may be\r\nattributed to restoration, particularly in the Infant Christ, and it is\r\nimpossible to deny the great beauty of the colour--a peculiar golden\r\nglow which is very unusual in fresco, and is indeed a translation\r\ninto that medium of the golden richness of Bellini's _tempera_ and\r\noil pieces. The Madonna's expression has a certain tenderness and\r\ncharm which is characteristic of Bellini, but it lacks the definite\r\nrealisation of a mood which he almost invariably compassed\" (_The\r\nPilot_, Jan. 5, 1901). On the other hand, according to a well-known\r\ncritic, writing in the _Daily Telegraph_, \"the wistfulness of the\r\nVirgin is not the wistfulness of Giambellino, but rather that of\r\nBartolommeo Montagna or some kindred painter of the school of Vicenza.\r\nAgain, the type of the Virgin and the adjustment of her headgear recall\r\nthe severe yet passionate master of Vicenza just named, under the\r\ninfluence, not so much of Giovanni Bellini as of the elder school of\r\nVenice--that of the Vivarini.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1699. THE LESSON.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Vermeer of Delft_ (Dutch: 1632-1675). _See 1383._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\nA \"symphony in black and white\"; cool in effect, almost to the point\r\nof austerity and chilliness. The faces are full of expression. The\r\nmaster turns in expectation to the pupil, as much as to say \"Come,\r\ndon't you know?\" The pupil is ready with his answer, and seems to\r\nappeal for encouragement: \"That is right, is it not?\" There is a\r\nsevere absence of details; everything in the picture is made to\r\ncontribute to the colour scheme. \"The play of cool light on the faces\r\nand hands, on the man's black dress, and the gray tablecloth with its\r\npatches of blue shadow; the design of the man's large hat against the\r\ndark background, the almost pathetic charm of the fair-haired boy's\r\nexpression, the regular black and white of the tiled floor,--all seem\r\nchosen for their pictorial value alone and skilfully composed into this\r\ngrave, almost austere harmony. The largeness of design and rejection\r\nof all superfluous detail in this picture connect it with Vermeer's\r\nmore daring compositions\" (M. H. Witt, in the _Nineteenth Century_,\r\nOctober 1900). Only one life-size group by the master is certainly\r\nauthenticated--the signed \"Courtesans\" at Dresden. The attribution of\r\nour picture to the master is uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n1700. PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Dutch School: 17th Century).\r\n\r\nA strong face, finely painted. The iron-gray of the man's hair combines\r\nharmoniously with the lawn collar and cuffs; a harmony in black and\r\ngray.\r\n\r\n\r\n1701. LANDSCAPE WITH WATERMILL.\r\n\r\n  _Allart van Everdingen_ (Dutch: 1612-1675).\r\n\r\n      This painter, an elder contemporary and precursor of Ruysdael,\r\n      was born at Alkmaar. He studied successively under Roelandt\r\n      Savery at Utrecht and Pieter Molyn at Haarlem. In a voyage\r\n      which he made to the Baltic he was shipwrecked on the coast\r\n      of Norway, and he remained for some time in that country.\r\n      On returning to his native land he reproduced the scenes\r\n      among which he had dwelt--torrents edged around by huge firs\r\n      springing out from sombre masses of rock, and throwing their\r\n      spray into large stretches of transparent water. A large number\r\n      of studies from nature remain from his hand, and these he\r\n      composed into pictures. His works had some vogue in Holland,\r\n      where they provided a counter-attraction to the views of the\r\n      softer and more smiling country which the \"Italianisers\" were\r\n      offering to the public. If Ruysdael did not himself go to\r\n      Norway, it must have been Everdingen's Norwegian scenes that\r\n      inspired him. Everdingen's \"colouring is simple and pure, his\r\n      touch broad and facile, and it is evident that every object\r\n      in his pictures was studied from nature.\" He was also an\r\n      accomplished etcher. He died at Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\r\n1776. THE ADORATION OF THE SHEPHERDS.\r\n\r\n  _Signorelli_ (Cortona: 1441-1523). _See 1128._\r\n\r\nA _predella_ picture; characteristic of the master, and in good\r\npreservation. Formerly in the possession of Count Colonna Ferretti (a\r\nnephew of Pius IX.) at Cortona.\r\n\r\n\r\n1786. THE LAKE OF THUN.\r\n\r\n  _Alexandre Calame_ (Swiss: 1810-1864).\r\n\r\n      This painter is of some interest in the history of painting as\r\n      one of the pioneers who discovered for artistic purposes the\r\n      picturesqueness of Switzerland. He was born at Vevay, and was\r\n      the son--not (as sometimes stated) of a simple mason, but--of\r\n      a clever stone-cutter. He was very delicate as a child, and\r\n      an accident at school deprived him of the sight of his right\r\n      eye. As a youth, Calame obtained employment in a bank at\r\n      Geneva. He further aided the narrow resources of his home by\r\n      making little Swiss views in colour, which the shopkeepers\r\n      took up. Foreigners were glad to bring them away as travelling\r\n      memorials, in place of photographs, which did not then exist.\r\n      His employer, M. Diodati, noticing young Calame's talent for\r\n      art, generously enabled him to obtain instruction. He made\r\n      rapid progress, and became headmaster of a drawing-school in\r\n      Geneva. In 1837 he began contributing to foreign exhibitions\r\n      views of Switzerland, and these won for him a considerable\r\n      reputation. He visited England in 1850, and here, as in other\r\n      countries, his works found many purchasers. In the South\r\n      Kensington Museum there is a large collection of his Swiss\r\n      views in water-colour. He was a lithographer and engraver, as\r\n      well as a painter, and his plates of Swiss landscapes were at\r\n      one time well known. He received commissions from many European\r\n      sovereigns, and was visited by all the great personages who\r\n      passed through Geneva.\r\n\r\n      In France, indeed, art-circles were cool towards him. \"_Un\r\n      Calame, deux Calames, trois Calames--que de calamités_\" ran the\r\n      phrase every year in the Paris Salon. But in Germany he found\r\n      warm admirers and formed several imitators. His lithographed\r\n      studies of trees, and his landscapes for copying remained in\r\n      use for some decades as a medium of instruction in drawing.\r\n      He was a conscientious workman, who finished the whole of\r\n      his canvas or paper with equal industry, and his drawing was\r\n      correct. But his colouring is insipid, and his atmosphere\r\n      somewhat heavy. \"By painting he understood the illumination of\r\n      drawings, and his drawing was that of an engraver. Sentiment\r\n      is replaced by correct manipulation, and in the deep blue\r\n      mirror of his Alpine lakes, as in the luminous red of his\r\n      Alpine summits, there is always to be seen the illuminator who\r\n      has first drawn the contours with a neat pencil and pedantic\r\n      correctness\" (Muther's _History of Modern Painting_, ii. 322).\r\n      Calame's fertility was very great. His note-books contain the\r\n      record of 450 finished pictures in oil, 500 studies, and 1200\r\n      water-colours (E. Rambert: _Alexandre Calame. Sa vie et son\r\n      oeuvre_, Paris, 1884).\r\n\r\nThe mountain in our picture is the Blumlis Alp: an afternoon effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n1810. PORTRAIT OF A BOY.\r\n\r\n  _François Duchatel_ (Flemish: 1616-1694).\r\n\r\n      This painter, whose works are very rare, is said to have\r\n      been a pupil of David Teniers, the younger. In some of his\r\n      pictures representing village festivals he followed the style\r\n      of that master; in others, of family groups, his work rather\r\n      resembles that of Gonzales Coques. His most important picture\r\n      is in the Museum at Ghent. It represents the \"Inauguration\r\n      of Charles II., King of Spain, as Count of Flanders,\" and\r\n      comprises about a thousand small figures. Duchatel was born at\r\n      Brussels. He worked for some time in Paris in conjunction with\r\n      his fellow-countryman Van der Meulen (see 1447). The picture\r\n      before us, with its vigorous touch and warm colour, shows that\r\n      Duchatel was an accomplished portrait-painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n1812. THE AGONY IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  Ascribed to _Lo Spagna_. (_See 1032_).\r\n\r\n\"The figure of the Saviour and the angel are identical with those in\r\nthe picture by Lo Spagna in the National Gallery numbered 1032, but\r\nthe execution of the work points to possibly a different hand. It was\r\nascribed by Passavant to Raphael. On the back of the panel are incised\r\nthe initials G. D. H. in a monogram surmounted by a crown, and an\r\ninscription on paper of probably the 18th century; 'All' Illmo et\r\nEccmo Giovanni Hiccolini (_sic_) Imbascatore (_sic_) di Toscana in\r\nRoma.' It was exhibited in the Art Treasures Exhibition at Manchester\r\nin 1857 (No. 146) under the name of Raphael, when it belonged to Mr.\r\nHenry Farrer, who had it from Russia\" (_National Gallery Report_, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n1842. HEADS OF ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Tuscan School_ (15th century).\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\nA characteristic fragment of fresco.\r\n\r\n\r\n1843. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Benedetto Bonfigli_ (Umbrian: 1420-1496).\r\n\r\n      A characteristic, if unimportant, example of one of the early\r\n      masters of the Umbrian School. Bonfigli (or Buonfiglio)\r\n      was a native of Perugia, and his principal work, a series\r\n      of frescoes, full of quaint costume and fantastic detail,\r\n      representing the lives of St. Louis of Toulouse and St.\r\n      Herculanus, is in the Palazzo del Consiglio there.\r\n\r\nThere is much naïvete in the surprised expression of the seated Sir\r\nJoseph, and much dainty charm in the youths with their vessels of gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n1845. THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n  _Paris Bordone_ (Venetian: 1503-1570). _See 637._\r\n\r\nThe Saviour holds in his hand a scroll inscribed \"Ecce sum lux mundi,\"\r\nbut the expression is vapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n1847. THE VIRGIN CROWNED BY ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Luca Signorelli_ (Umbrian: 1441-1523). _See 1128._\r\n\r\nThis important picture, in a splendid frame of the period, is of\r\nspecial interest from the record of authenticity which it bears.\r\nOn the cartellino at the foot, is an inscription informing us that\r\n\"the noble picture before us was an offering of devotion by Master\r\nAloiusius, a French physician, and Thomasina his wife,\" that \"Luca\r\nSignorelli, the illustrious painter of Cortona\" was the artist, and\r\nthat the date was 1515. In the archives of the little town of Montone,\r\nnear Umbertide, a deed, dated September 10, 1515, has been discovered,\r\nwhich informs us further that the picture was painted for Master\r\nAloiusius, living at Montone, for the chapel of St. Christina at that\r\nplace, by Luca Signorelli \"on account of their mutual and cordial\r\nfriendship, and in consideration of the free services which he had\r\nreceived, and in future hopes to receive, from the said Aloiusius.\"\r\nThe physician on his part undertakes in the same deed to give free\r\nmedical attendance henceforth to the said Luca, and to any member of\r\nhis household. The place for which the picture was painted accounts\r\nfor the figure of St. Christina, on the right of the Virgin. Among her\r\nadventures was being tied to a millstone and cast into the Lake of\r\nBolsena, but angels upheld the millstone, and she floated back to land.\r\nThe legend explains also the charming view of a lake seen beneath the\r\nfeet of the Virgin. The altar-piece was discovered by Signor Mancini in\r\na cellar at Montone, much obscured by neglect, and was for some time in\r\nhis collection at Città di Castello. It has now been cleaned, and is\r\napparently in fine condition.\r\n\r\nThe date of the picture shows that it was painted towards the end of\r\nthe artist's life, when he was 74 years of age, and some critics have\r\nfound in the work signs that the master's hand was losing its cunning.\r\nCertainly the composition of the principal lines--with the upper figure\r\nat each side in line with the lower--is somewhat awkward, and the St.\r\nChristina is a heavy figure with a meaningless expression. That of St.\r\nSebastian, however, is vigorous; the central group of the Madonna and\r\nChild borne by cherubims is impressive; the angels above are very fine,\r\nand St. Jerome and St. Nicholas of Bari are good. The details of St.\r\nNicholas's robe and mitre deserve study. It is amusing to note that two\r\nof the critics who scarify the picture single out the landscape--the\r\none, as the worst part of it, the other, as its redeeming feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n1848. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Abraham Raguineau_ (Dutch: 1623-1681).\r\n\r\n      This painter, born in London, settled at the Hague, where he\r\n      seems to have met with little prosperity. At a later time, he\r\n      was living at Leyden, and was writing-master to the Prince of\r\n      Orange.\r\n\r\nThe picture is signed, and dated (1657), at the top of the oval on the\r\nleft, and is the only known signed work of the painter in existence.\r\nIt shows us a pleasant-looking, if somewhat characterless youth, aged\r\n18 (as the description states), whose coat, shirt, and collar make a\r\ndelicate study in cool grey tones.\r\n\r\n\r\n1849. THE NATIVITY.\r\n\r\n  _Jacopo Pacchiarotto_ (Sienese: 1474-1540).\r\n\r\n      The story of this painter and revolutionist--who, joining\r\n      the Bardotti and taking part in popular risings in Siena,\r\n      was concealed by the monks in a tomb, beside a newly-buried\r\n      corpse--is familiar from Browning's humorous telling of it\r\n      in his _Pacchiarotto and how he worked in Distemper_. He was\r\n      originally a pupil of Bernardino Fungai (see 1331); but his\r\n      later work shows the influence of Fra Bartolommeo and Raphael.\r\n\r\n\"He appears to have studied Raphael,\" says Lanzi, \"with the greatest\r\ncare; and there are heads and whole figures so lively, and with such\r\ngrace in the features, that to some connoisseurs they seem to possess\r\nthe ideal.\" Certainly there is a liveliness and an appropriateness\r\nof expression about the figures in this picture which distinguish it\r\nfrom the stiff mannerism of earlier Sienese pictures. Kneeling in\r\nadoration are St. John the Baptist and St. Jerome (with the stone, in\r\nhis character as penitent). St. Stephen, behind St. John, carries on\r\nhis head the stone, as symbol of his martyrdom. Behind St. Jerome is\r\nSt. Nicholas of Bari, a finely rendered portrait of venerable age. Of\r\nthe figures in the niche-shaped panels in the frame, that, at the top\r\non the left, of the Angel of the Annunciation is particularly graceful.\r\nThe panels of the predella show the Agony in the Garden, the Betrayal,\r\nthe Crucifixion, the Deposition, and the Resurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n1850. A SCENE ON THE ICE.\r\n\r\n  _Andries Vermeulen_ (Dutch: 1763-1814). _See 1447._\r\n\r\n\r\n1851. THE INTERIOR OF A STABLE.\r\n\r\n  _Dutch School_ (17th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n1860. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Ascribed to Sir Antonio More_ (Flemish: 1572-1578).\r\n\r\n\r\n1872. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Alvise Vivarini_ (Venetian, painted 1461-1503).\r\n\r\n      All visitors to Venice are familiar with a picture, in the\r\n      church of the Redentore, of the Madonna and Sleeping Child,\r\n      with two playing angels; there is a bird on the curtain above,\r\n      and some fruit on the parapet below. It is one of the most\r\n      charming little pictures in Venice, and is usually shown as a\r\n      work of Giovanni Bellini. Modern criticism assigns it, however,\r\n      to Alvise Vivarini, to whom an important place in the history\r\n      of Venetian painting is now accorded as an artist developing on\r\n      lines independent of the Bellinis, and as the Master of Lorenzo\r\n      Lotto.[255] That he was largely employed in the Ducal Palace\r\n      we know from Vasari, who describes his works there, commending\r\n      more particularly their fine perspective and \"portraits from\r\n      the life so well depicted as to prove that this master copied\r\n      nature very faithfully.\" These works, begun in 1489 and stopped\r\n      by the artist's death in 1503, were destroyed in the fire of\r\n      1577. Of his extant works, the earliest one, which is dated\r\n      (1475), is at Montefiorentino. The altar-piece in the Venice\r\n      Academy is dated 1480, and that in the Berlin Gallery is\r\n      probably of the same period. To a later date are assigned the\r\n      Madonnas of the Redentore and S. Giovanni in Bragora at Venice,\r\n      and the present picture. His latest work, finished after his\r\n      death by Marco Basaiti, is the large altar-piece of St. Ambrose\r\n      in the Frari.\r\n\r\nThis picture (which is signed on a cartellino on the parapet) is, says\r\nMr. Berenson, \"delightful as a composition. The Madonna is seen down\r\nto the waist, holding the Child on a parapet, while behind her, to\r\nthe left, a window opens out on a charming landscape. The Madonna's\r\nface has a tinge of almost Botticellian melancholy, as in Lotto's\r\nRecanati altarpiece. The Child is almost the _putto_ on the right in\r\nthe Redentore picture, but somewhat more bony. The draperies already\r\nhave the freedom of Alvise's latest works.\" The picture, formerly in\r\nthe Manfrini Gallery, was presented by Mr. Charles Loeser in 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n1895. BARON WAHA DE LINTER OF NAMUR.\r\n\r\n  _Jacob Jordaens_ (Flemish: 1593-1678).\r\n\r\n      Jordaens, who stands next to Rubens and Van Dyck among the\r\n      great Flemish painters, was a fellow-pupil with the former\r\n      under Adam Van Noort, whose daughter he married in 1616. In\r\n      the same year he became a member of the Painter's Guild of\r\n      St. Luke, being described as a \"water-colourist\"; his first\r\n      works were in fact paintings in distemper and cartoons for the\r\n      tapestry workers. By 1620 his fame as a painter of pictures\r\n      was established. His works, which are very numerous, are of\r\n      all kinds of subjects, but he is little represented in British\r\n      Galleries. Examples may be seen, however, in the Wallace\r\n      Collection and the Dulwich Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe name of the sitter is on the frame; his coat of arms and crest,\r\nwith the inscription \"Aetatis suae 63, 1626,\" are on the upper corner\r\nof the picture. It is a fine portrait, characteristic of the exuberance\r\nand vigour which mark the work of Jordaens.\r\n\r\n\r\n1896. INTERIOR OF A CHURCH.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Saenredam_ (Dutch: 1597-1665).\r\n\r\n      Saenredam, who lived at Haarlem, is one of the leading Dutch\r\n      painters of architecture. His interiors in particular are\r\n      remarkable for their luminous effect. Another example of them\r\n      may be seen at Dulwich.\r\n\r\nThe church is the Domkerk at Utrecht. Notice the boy making a\r\ncaricature on the wall; underneath this is the artist's signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n1897. THE CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo Monaco_ (Florentine: 1370-1425).\r\n\r\n      Don Lorenzo was born at Siena, but became a Camaldose monk of\r\n      the Convent of the Angeli at Florence, his early practice being\r\n      that of a miniaturist. In the principal of his known works--an\r\n      altar-piece of 1413 now in the Uffizi at Florence, Mr. Roger\r\n      Fry bids us note the cunning with which the painter \"weaves\r\n      together his flowing curves,\" the \"rare charm in his ætherial,\r\n      unstructural draperies,\" and \"a kind of visible music\" in his\r\n      design (_Monthly Review_, June 1901).\r\n\r\nSomething of these qualities may be seen in the long and slender\r\nfigures of our picture. The decorativeness of its patterns, and the\r\narchitectural details, should also be noticed. The picture, formerly\r\nin a church at Certaldo, is in its original Gothic frame. Crowe and\r\nCavalcaselle (vol. i. p. 554) suppose the picture to have formed part\r\nof a larger altar-piece of which the two wings are in our gallery,\r\nascribed to the school of Taddeo Gaddi (Nos. 215, 216). But the\r\ndifferent scale of the figures in them negatives this supposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n1903. LANDSCAPE, WITH DOGS AND GAME.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Fyt_ (Dutch: 1609-1661). _See 1003._\r\n  _See also_ (p. xxi)\r\n\r\n\r\n1909. THE EXECUTION OF LADY JANE GREY.\r\n\r\n  _Paul Delaroche_ (French: 1797-1856).\r\n\r\n      Hippolyte, or (as he called himself) Paul, Delaroche, was the\r\n      popular French painter of his time, and this is one of his\r\n      best known pictures. He turned to historical illustration\r\n      as affording scope for an art which should reconcile the\r\n      \"classical\" with the \"romantic.\" He was the embodiment in the\r\n      art of painting, as someone has put it, of Louis Philippe's\r\n      maxim of the _juste-milieu_. To the same class with the present\r\n      picture belong his \"Death of Queen Elizabeth\" (_Louvre_), \"The\r\n      Princes in the Tower\" (familiar from engravings), and several\r\n      works in the Wallace Collection. Ruskin, while not enamoured\r\n      of his pictures (see _Fors Clavigera_, Letter 35), allows\r\n      that his \"honest effort to grasp the reality of conceived\r\n      scenes\" compares favourably with \"the deathful formalism and\r\n      fallacy of what was once called 'Historical Art,'\" and that his\r\n      kindly-meant talent has \"contributed greatly to the instruction\r\n      of innumerable households\" (_Works_, vol. xix. pp. 50, 205).\r\n      Théophile Gautier, more contemptuously, described Delaroche's\r\n      art as that of \"historical illustration for the family use of\r\n      the _bourgeoisie_,\" and the vogue which it enjoyed all over\r\n      Europe set the fashion for what became a prevailing style of\r\n      \"stage-dramatic representation\" in painting. In 1833 (the\r\n      date on our picture) Delaroche was appointed a professor at\r\n      the École des Beaux-Arts, and from 1837-1841 he was engaged\r\n      upon the principal work of his life, the decoration of the\r\n      amphitheatre of that school--the idea of his design being an\r\n      assemblage of the chiefs of the arts in past ages to witness\r\n      the triumphs of the labourers in his own age. He was assisted\r\n      in this colossal work by many pupils; among them was Edward\r\n      Armitage, R. A. (see vol. ii. No. 759), who has given an\r\n      interesting account of the manner of their co-operation (see\r\n      _Report of the Commissioners on the Royal Academy_, 1863, p.\r\n      64). The \"Hemicycle\" was much damaged by fire in 1853, and was\r\n      restored after the death of Delaroche by Robert Henry.\r\n\r\nThe scene is in the Tower, February 12, 1554. Lady Jane Grey, condemned\r\nfor treason, has been blindfolded, and is being led to the block by the\r\nLieutenant of the Tower.\r\n\r\n\r\n1914. A ROYAL CHÂTEAU IN HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n1915. A DUTCH CHURCH AND MARKET PLACE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan van der Heyden_ (Dutch: 1637-1712). _See 866._\r\n\r\nThe château in the former picture is \"The House in the Wood\" (Huis ten\r\nBosch), built in 1647, in which the first Peace Conference was held at\r\nThe Hague.\r\n\r\n\r\n1917. AN ITALIAN LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Both_ (Dutch: 1610-1662). _See 71._\r\n\r\nA fine example of the \"soft golden tones\" noted in our account of Both\r\nas characteristic of his best works.\r\n\r\n\r\n1918. MARKET PLACE AT THE HAGUE.\r\n\r\n  _Paul Constantin La Fargue_ (Dutch: died 1782).\r\n\r\n      The work of an artist (best known by his drawings and etchings)\r\n      who painted many small pictures of his native city, The Hague.\r\n\r\nA scene in the Groén Market; the tower of the Groote Kerk in the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\n\r\n1925. PORTRAIT OF A MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Lucas Cranach_ (German: 1472-1553). _See 291._\r\n\r\nUpon the shield to the left is the painter's crest, as in No. 291; with\r\nthe date 1524. The head is fine and full of character; the hands are\r\nless successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n1930. PORTRAIT OF A LADY AS ST. MARGARET.\r\n\r\n  _Francisco Zurbaran_ (Spanish: 1598-1662). _See 230._\r\n\r\nZurbaran, it has been said, was \"a great though not a professed,\r\nportrait painter.\" The lady is St. Margaret only in virtue of the\r\ndragon, the emblem of the saint; otherwise this is a portrait of a\r\nyoung lady in a fanciful country costume.\r\n\r\n\r\n1937. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Bartholomeus van der Helst_ (Dutch: 1611-1670). _See 140._\r\n\r\nThis picture, said to be a portrait of a lady of the house of Braganza,\r\nwas formerly in the collection of Mr. Beckford at Fonthill. It is\r\nsigned, and dated 1645. The \"careful finish,\" which Sir Joshua Reynolds\r\ncommended in the work of Van der Helst, may be well studied here in the\r\nrich and beautiful costume and jewellery.\r\n\r\n\r\n1938. PORTRAIT OF HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\n  _Albrecht Dürer_ (German: 1471-1528).\r\n\r\n      The acquisition of this picture adds to the Gallery a fine\r\n      example of the great artist, who in all the characteristics\r\n      of his art is the central representative of the German\r\n      spirit,--\"its combination of the wild and rugged with the\r\n      homely and the tender, its meditative depth, its enigmatic\r\n      gloom, its sincerity and energy, its iron diligence and\r\n      discipline.\" The range of his powers is shown not only in\r\n      his works that survive, but in the estimation in which he\r\n      was held by his contemporaries. When he went to Venice they\r\n      \"praised his beautiful colouring,\" Bellini honoured him with\r\n      his friendship, \"and he was everywhere treated,\" so he wrote,\r\n      \"as a gentleman.\" Raphael sent him some drawings, on one of\r\n      which this note in Dürer's handwriting may still be seen:\r\n      \"Raphael of Urbino, who has been so highly esteemed by the\r\n      Pope, drew these naked figures, and sent them to Albrecht Dürer\r\n      in Nuremberg to show him his hand.\" He was a writer as well as\r\n      an artist. \"Painting,\" said Melanchthon, \"was the least of his\r\n      accomplishments\"; whilst of his personal qualities Luther bore\r\n      testimony when he wrote: \"As for Dürer, assuredly affection\r\n      bids us mourn for one who was the best of men.... May he rest\r\n      in peace with his fathers: Amen!\"\r\n\r\n      He was born at Nuremberg--the son of a goldsmith and the third\r\n      of eighteen children--and Albert of Nuremberg he remained\r\n      to the end--the painter of a city distinguished for its\r\n      \"self-restrained, contented, quaint domesticity.\" His first\r\n      training was from his father in the goldsmith's trade; next,\r\n      when fifteen, he was apprenticed for three and a half years\r\n      to Wohlgemuth, the chief painter of the town; and lastly\r\n      came his _Wanderjahre_, a long course of travel and study\r\n      in foreign lands. In 1494 he settled down at Nuremberg, and\r\n      there, with the exception of a visit to Venice in 1505-1506\r\n      (see p. 190 _n._), and to the Netherlands in 1520-1521, he\r\n      passed the remainder of his life in the busy and honoured\r\n      exercise of the various branches of his art. He had married,\r\n      at the age of twenty-three, a well-to-do merchant's daughter.\r\n      The stories which have long passed current with regard to her\r\n      being imperious, avaricious, and fretful, have been entirely\r\n      discredited on closer knowledge of the facts. The marriage was\r\n      childless, but husband and wife lived throughout on terms both\r\n      of affection and companionship. As for examples of Dürer's\r\n      work, the widely-spread prints of the \"Knight and Death\"\r\n      and the \"Melancholia\" give the best idea of his powers of\r\n      imagination; while in actual specimens of his handiwork in\r\n      drawing, the British Museum is the second richest collection in\r\n      the world.\r\n\r\nThe best commentary on this picture is the description of his father\r\nwhich Dürer wrote in a history of his family:--\r\n\r\n      \"My dear father became a goldsmith, a pure and skilful man. He\r\n      passed his life in great toil and stern, hard labour, having\r\n      nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for\r\n      himself, his wife, and his children; so that he had little\r\n      enough. He underwent, moreover, manifold afflictions, trials,\r\n      and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him,\r\n      for he lived an honourable, Christian life; was a man patient\r\n      of spirit, mild and peaceable to all, and very thankful towards\r\n      God. For himself he had little need of company and worldly\r\n      pleasures: he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man.\r\n      This my dear father was very careful with his children to bring\r\n      them up in the fear of God; for it was his highest wish to\r\n      train them well that they might be pleasing in the sight both\r\n      of God and man. Wherefore his daily speech to us was that we\r\n      should love God and deal truly with our neighbours.\"\r\n\r\nIt is just such a man that the painter here sets before us. \"The face\r\nis pathetic with the deep furrows ploughed in by seventy years of\r\nlabour and sorrow. Yet as he stands there, so quietly, for his son\r\nto paint him, there is just a trace of pleasure and pride lurking in\r\nthe kind old face\" (Conway's _Literary Remains of Dürer_, p. 35). An\r\ninscription on the top of the panel records that it was painted in\r\n1497, when the father was seventy and the son twenty-six. There are\r\nthree other versions of the picture--at Munich, Frankfort, and Syon\r\nHouse respectively, and the question which is the original has been\r\nmuch disputed. The present picture (exhibited at the Old Masters, 1903)\r\nwas bought, with No. 1937, for £10,000 from the Marquis of Northampton.\r\n\r\n\r\n1939. VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _French School_ (15th century).\r\n\r\nA little picture almost as delicately wrought as an illuminated page in\r\na missal. The donor is kneeling in the door of the Gothic chapel. The\r\nVirgin and Child are in \"a garden enclosed,\" where columbines spring\r\nup at her feet; at the top of the picture are two small figures of St\r\nMichael driving out Satan.\r\n\r\n\r\n1944. \"PORTRAIT OF ARIOSTO.\"\r\n\r\n  _Titian_ (Venetian: 1477-1576). _See 4._\r\n\r\nThis superb portrait, though traditionally called \"Ariosto,\" bears no\r\nresemblance to the poet. It is the picture of an Italian aristocrat of\r\nthe Renaissance that the painter sets before us; of a man refined and\r\nluxurious, unimpassioned, and somewhat cynical. Immortalised by art,\r\nhe looks out upon us with a somewhat scornful glance; the handsome\r\nhead is one of those thoroughly individualised representations which,\r\nonce studied, fix themselves indelibly in the memory. Sober and yet\r\nsumptuous in colour, the picture is enveloped in a luminous haze; and\r\nthe costume, with the quilted sleeve of steely grey, is a masterpiece\r\nof technique.\r\n\r\nThe picture, which is signed on the parapet Titianus V. (with another\r\nV. at the further end of the parapet), belongs to Titian's earlier\r\nperiod, when he was under the influence of Giorgione, to which master\r\nindeed it is sometimes attributed.[256] There are several versions\r\nof the picture, including one in Lord Rosebery's collection at\r\nMentmore.[257] The present picture (Old Masters, 1895) was bought by\r\nSir George Donaldson from Cobham Hall (Lord Darnley) for £30,000, and\r\nsold by him for the same price to the nation; a portion of the sum\r\n(£9000) being contributed by Mr. W. W. Astor, Mr. Alfred Beit, Lord\r\nBurton, Lord Iveagh, Mr. Pierpont Morgan, and Lady Wantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n1951. PORTRAIT OF DR. PERAL.\r\n\r\n  _Francisco Goya_ (Spanish: 1746-1828). _See 1471._\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps as good an example as could be found of the brilliancy and\r\nexecution and vivid portrayal of character which characterise this\r\nartist at his best\" (Official Catalogue).\r\n\r\n\r\n1952. MR. AND MRS. EDWIN EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n  _Henri Fantin-Latour_ (French: 1836-1904). _See 1686._\r\n\r\nA fine example of this artist's portraiture, representing old friends\r\nof the French painter, with whom he stayed when in this country. Mr.\r\nEdwards, landscape painter in water-colours and etcher (1823-1879), is\r\nexamining a print with an expert's eye. His wife, perhaps less happily\r\nposed (because seemingly disconnected with the other figure), looks\r\nout at the spectator with her arms folded. Mrs. Edwards who presented\r\nthis picture to the nation in 1904 died in 1907. \"Nearly every one of\r\nFantin-Latour's pictures in this country passed through her hands, and\r\nhave her private marks, by which she was able to identify them after a\r\nlapse of many years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1953. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Lazzaro Bastiani_ (Venetian: about 1425-1512). _See 750._\r\n\r\nIn the background is the festoon of fruit, familiar to us in Crivelli's\r\npictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n1969. A GREEK CAPTIVE.\r\n\r\n  _Henriette Browne_ (French: 1829-1901).\r\n\r\n\r\n2057. VENUS WITH THE MIRROR.\r\n\r\n  _Velazquez_ (Spanish: 1599-1660). _See 197._\r\n\r\nThis celebrated picture--commonly called \"Venus and Cupid,\" but known\r\nin Spain as the \"Venus del Espejo\"--is one of the master's rare studies\r\nof the nude, and it is characteristic of his genius. The subject is\r\nprofessedly mythological, but Velazquez seeks no adventitious interest\r\nfrom legendary association or idealistic grace. Here, as everywhere,\r\nhis standpoint is frankly realistic, whilst the work is saved from\r\ncommonness by purity of colour and sincerity of artistic purpose. It\r\nhas been truly said that the flesh-painting here makes many another\r\npicture in the Gallery look lifeless and unreal. The face of \"Venus\" in\r\nthe mirror--with broad features enframed in plainly dressed hair--does\r\nnot realise the promise of the pretty outline of the head with the\r\nbrown hair tied in a knot; and it has been suggested (by Dr. Justi)\r\nthat \"perhaps the damsel did not wish to be recognised.\" However\r\nthis may be, the very plainness of the face emphasises the artist's\r\nintention. The picturesqueness of the outline and modulations of the\r\nback in a youthful female figure was the artistic effect which he set\r\nhimself to render.\r\n\r\nThe history of the picture is well authenticated.[258] It was painted\r\nabout 1650, and passed into the possession of the Duke of Alba on his\r\nmarriage in 1688 with Doña Catalina de Haro of Guzmom, Condessa-Duquesa\r\nde Olivares, the picture forming part of her dowry. It is mentioned in\r\nan inventory of the paintings belonging to her family as \"a Venus of\r\nlife size reclining nude with a child who holds up for her a mirror\r\ninto which she gazes. This picture is an original work by Don Diego\r\nVelazquez.\" In an account of the Duke of Alba's palace in 1776 it is\r\ndescribed as \"the very celebrated Venus depicted from the back, in the\r\nreclining posture, with her face reflected in a mirror towards which\r\nshe directs her gaze.\" Subsequently the picture became the property of\r\nthe Spanish statesmen, Godoy. In 1808 it was sold and brought to this\r\ncountry; and purchased through Mr. Buchanan for the sum of £500, by Mr.\r\nMorritt, the friend of Sir Walter Scott. It became an heirloom in Mr.\r\nMorritt's family at Rokeby Hall, Teesdale. \"Twice,\" says Dr. Justi in\r\nhis life of Velazquez, \"in 1879 and 1885 I had the privilege of seeing\r\nit there and convincing myself of its faultless preservation and the\r\noriginal brilliancy and freshness of its colour.\" It was exhibited\r\nin 1857 among the \"Art Treasures\" at Manchester and in 1890 at the\r\n\"Old Masters.\" It was ultimately sold under an order of the Court of\r\nChancery, the price obtained being £30,500. It passed into the hands\r\nof Messrs. Agnew, and its sale out of this country was believed to be\r\nimminent when the National Art Collections Fund came to the rescue and\r\nraised by subscription the amount now necessary for its purchase.\r\n\r\nThe sum paid was £45,000,[259] and the picture was presented by the\r\nFund to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n2058. SUNNY DAYS IN THE FOREST.\r\n\r\n  _Diaz_ (French: 1809-1876).\r\n\r\n      Narciso Virgilio Diaz de la Peña, one of the members of \"the\r\n      Barbizon School\" (see p. 698), was born, of Spanish extraction,\r\n      at Bordeaux. Left an orphan at the age of ten, he was adopted\r\n      by a Protestant clergyman, living at Bellevue, near Sèvres.\r\n      He was of a truant disposition, and sleeping once upon the\r\n      grass in the woods he was bitten by a viper; the accident\r\n      cost him his left leg, and he had to go through life with\r\n      a wooden one, which he called his _pilon_. In after years,\r\n      when his pictures were rejected at the Salon, he would make a\r\n      hole in the canvas with his wooden leg, saying with a laugh\r\n      \"what's the use of being rich? I can't have my _pilon_ set in\r\n      diamonds.\" His early years were of uncertain fortune, spent in\r\n      earning a precarious living, sometimes as a painter on china\r\n      at Sèvres, sometimes as an errand-boy in the streets. But he\r\n      had confidence in his talent, and gradually found a market for\r\n      his pictures. These were at first of figures, flowers, or other\r\n      _genre_. A meeting in 1830 with Théodore Rousseau sent him to\r\n      Fontainebleau and nature. For Rousseau, he entertained the most\r\n      profound admiration, the story of \"the toast of Diaz,\" is well\r\n      known. Diaz had been preferred to Rousseau in admission to the\r\n      Legion of Honour. In attending a dinner given in 1851 to the\r\n      new _officiers_, Diaz rose and invited the company to drink \"À\r\n      Rousseau, notre maître oublié!\" Of his figure-subjects, one of\r\n      the best \"La Fée aux Perles\" is in the Louvre, but it is on his\r\n      landscapes that his fame chiefly rests. \"Go into the forest,\"\r\n      it has been said, \"lose yourself among its trees, and you can\r\n      only say 'À Diaz'.\" To him, however, the forest was not, as\r\n      to some others of the school, or as to Ruysdael, sombre or\r\n      serious. It was a keyboard on which to play colour-fantasies.\r\n      \"You paint stinging-nettles,\" he said to Millet, \"I prefer\r\n      roses.\" \"Pearls,\" said Théophile Gautier of his pictures,\r\n      \"brilliant as precious stones, prismatic gems and rainbow\r\n      jewels.\" His pictures have been called not so much landscapes,\r\n      as \"tree-scapes.\" \"Have you seen my last stem?\" he used to say\r\n      himself to his visitors. But it was the play of sunlight on\r\n      the stems that he chiefly loved. Diaz is the colourist of the\r\n      Barbizon School.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this sparkling little picture of a glade in the\r\nforest of Fontainebleau, lit by the afternoon sun, marked somewhat\r\nof an era in the history of the National Gallery. It was the first\r\nillustration on its walls of the modern French school of landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n2062. CHRIST TEACHING FROM ST. PETER'S SHIP.\r\n\r\n  _Herman Saftleven_ (Dutch: 1609-1685).\r\n\r\n      This painter, whose landscapes were praised by connoisseurs of\r\n      the time as \"distinguished by great care and accuracy,\" was\r\n      born at Rotterdam, was a pupil of Jan van Goyen, and worked\r\n      chiefly at Rotterdam and Utrecht. He painted many views on the\r\n      Rhine and Maas; and one of the former, in the Dulwich Gallery,\r\n      dated 1656, is among his best works.\r\n\r\nThe scene is the Lake of Gennesaret; the people are assembled on the\r\nshore to hear the words of Christ who is seated in St. Peter's ship\r\n(Luke v. 1-3).\r\n\r\n\r\n2069. THE \"MADONNA OF THE TOWER.\"\r\n\r\n  _Raphael_ (Urbino: 1483-1520). _See 1171._\r\n\r\nThis picture is attributed to the earlier portion of Raphael's \"Roman\r\nperiod\" (see p. 569); to about the same time, that is, as that of the\r\n\"Garvagh Madonna\" (No. 744). It takes its commonly accepted name from\r\nthe small tower which may be seen in the distance of the landscape\r\nbackground; it is sometimes referred to as \"The Madonna with the\r\nStanding Child,\" or \"The Virgin with the Downcast Eyes,\" or \"The\r\nRogers Madonna.\" It is painted on canvas, and has suffered much from\r\naccident and repainting; but the feeling of the picture is thoroughly\r\nRaphaelesque in purity of colour and charm of expression. The mother's\r\nface is full of affection, sweet and yet serious; while the Child looks\r\nout of the canvas, \"as if unconscious of all but the joy of the moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture was formerly in the Orleans collection, whence it was\r\npurchased by Mr. Willett in 1792 for £150. It next passed into the\r\ncollection of Mr. Henry Hope, at whose sale in 1816 it was bought\r\nfor 59 guineas by Samuel Rogers, the poet. \"In the atmosphere of\r\nSt. James's Place,\" says a chronicler of the works from the Orleans\r\nCollection which passed into the possession of Rogers, \"they may\r\nsafely be said to have been worshipped with a purer incense than they\r\never received before. We may be pardoned for recalling a few of them.\r\nForemost was a Raphael, one of the master's sweetest compositions, the\r\nChild standing with one foot on his mother's hand. It had been reduced\r\nby ruthless rubbings to a mere shadow, but the beauty was ineffaceable:\r\nhanging--how well remembered!--in the best light on the left-hand wall\r\nin the drawing-room. Then two glorious Titians--one of them, Christ\r\nappearing to the Magdalene\" (_Quarterly Review_, Oct. 1888). The\r\npicture last mentioned is also now in the National Gallery (No. 270)\r\nwhich possesses further from his collection, Nos. 269, 271, 276, 279.\r\nAt his sale in 1856 the Raphael was bought for 480 guineas by Mr. R. J.\r\nMackintosh, son of the historian, who exhibited it at Manchester in the\r\nArt Treasures Exhibition of 1857; it was also shown at the Old Masters\r\nin 1902. From him it passed to Miss Eva Mackintosh who has now (1906)\r\npresented it to the nation. In the British Museum there is a cartoon of\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n2078. THE HARBOUR OF TROUVILLE.\r\n\r\n  _Louis Eugène Boudin_ (French: 1825-1898).\r\n\r\nA view from within the harbour looking out to the open sea \"between\r\nthe piers.\" Signed and dated \"E. Boudin, '88,\" with the title on the\r\nback in the artist's handwriting, \"Entre les jetées, Trouville.\"\r\nThis picture by a fine sea-painter was presented by the National Art\r\nCollections Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n2081. LULLI AND HIS FELLOW MUSICIANS AT THE FRENCH COURT.\r\n\r\n  _Hyacinthe Rigaud_ (French, 1659-1743). _See 903._\r\n\r\nJean Baptiste de Lulli (or Lully) was the celebrated composer\r\n(1633-1687) for whose music Louis XIV. had a great predilection. For\r\nhim the King created a new company of musicians called _Les Petits\r\nViolons_ or _La Bande des Seize_. Lulli composed also the incidental\r\nmusic for Molière's plays. The portraits of Lulli, says a contemporary,\r\nare fairly like him, but he was smaller and stouter than they show.\r\n\r\n\r\n2082. A FLORENTINE LADY; _on the reverse_, A SYMBOLIC ANGEL.\r\n\r\n  _School of Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510). _See 1034._\r\n\r\nThe portrait is supposed to represent the unknown artist's wife; the\r\nangel holds an armillary sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n2083. PORTRAIT OF DR. BATTISTA FIERA.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo Costa_ (Ferrarese: 1460-1535). _See 629._\r\n\r\nThe portrait, \"warts and all,\" of a theologian, physician, and poet\r\nof Mantua. So he is described under the engraving of this picture,\r\nwhich is the frontispiece to a book published at Padua in 1649 and\r\nentitled _Baptistae Fierae Mantuani Medici sua aetate clarissimi Coena\r\nnotis illustrata a Carolo Avantio Rhodigino_. The portrait, a _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ of a painter whose portraits are rare, was shown at the\r\nBurlington Fine Arts Club in 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n2084. A YOUNG MAN IN BLACK.\r\n\r\n  _Florentine School._\r\n\r\n\"This picture has been attributed to Piero Pollajuolo and to the\r\npainter known as 'Amico di Sandro'\" (_National Gallery Report_, 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n2085. BIANCA CAPELLO.\r\n\r\n  _School of Bronzino_ (Florentine: 1502-1572). _See 649._\r\n\r\n\r\n2086. THE GATE WITH A ROUND TOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n2087. A PASTORAL LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Zuccarelli_ (Florentine: 1702-1788).\r\n\r\n      This painter of decorative landscape was much employed in\r\n      England, and during a sojourn here from 1752 to 1773 he became\r\n      one of the foundation members of our Royal Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\n2088. CHRIST TEACHING.\r\n\r\n  _Bernardino Luini_ (Lombard: about 1475-1533). _See 18._\r\n\r\nThe face, attitude, and design are the same as in the Christ of No. 18;\r\nbut the beautiful expression is absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n2089. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Lombard School_: 16th century.\r\n\r\nFresco on plaster; not unlike the work of Beltraffio.\r\n\r\n\r\n2090, 2091. ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Moretto_ (Brescian: 1498-1555). _See 299._\r\n\r\nCompanion figures, with wreaths of roses, inscribed (on the first) _Ave\r\nRegina_, (on the second) _Coelorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n2092, 2093. ST. JOSEPH AND ST. JEROME.\r\n\r\n  _Moretto_ (Brescian: 1498-1555). _See 299._\r\n\r\n\r\n2094. IL CAVALIERE.\r\n\r\n  _Moroni_ (Bergamese: 1525-1578). _See 697._\r\n\r\n\r\n2095. A MAN IN BLACK.\r\n\r\n  _Alvise Vivarini_ (Venetian: painted 1461-1503). _See 1872._\r\n\r\nA fine portrait, hitherto attributed to Antonello da Messina, but now\r\nassigned to Vivarini, on the analogy of similar busts attributed by Mr.\r\nBerenson to that painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n2096. THE MAN WITH A BEARD.\r\n\r\n  _Romanino_ (Brescian: about 1485-1566). _See 297._\r\n\r\n\r\n2097. THE LADY WITH THE CARNATIONS.\r\n\r\n  _Paris Bordone_ (Venetian: 1500-1570). _See 637._\r\n\r\n\r\n2098. S. MARIA DELLA SALUTE, VENICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n2099. THE DUCAL PALACE, VENICE\r\n\r\n  _Francesco Guardi_ (Venetian: 1712-1793). _See 210._\r\n\r\nExcellent examples of the best manner of this painter.\r\n\r\n\r\n2100. THE MARRIAGE OF THE EMPEROR FREDERICK I.\r\n\r\n  _Tiepolo_ (Venetian: 1692-1769). _See 1192, 1193._\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in the account of Tiepolo (under Nos. 1192, 1193)\r\nthat he executed wall-decorations in the Royal Palace, formerly the\r\nepiscopal residence, at Wurzburg. The present picture is almost the\r\nsame in composition as one of those. The subject--the marriage of\r\nFrederick Barbarossa in 1156, to Beatrix, daughter of the Count of\r\nBurgundy--lends itself well to Tiepolo's \"feeling for splendour,\" and\r\nswift mastery of decorative effect. The Imperial banner, emblazoned\r\nwith the black eagle, is borne by a warrior. The bishops of Wurzburg\r\nwere princes of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n2101. ESTHER AT THE THRONE OF AHASUERUS.\r\n\r\n  _Sebastiano Ricci_ (Venetian: 1659-1734). _See 857._\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the Book of Esther (xv. 7-16); \"Then lifting up his\r\ncountenance that shone with majesty, he looked very fiercely upon her,\r\nand the queen fell down and was pale and fainted,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n2102, 2103. TOWN AND RIVER SCENES.\r\n\r\n  _Jacopo Marieschi_ (Venetian: 1711-1794).\r\n\r\n      By this painter, an imitator of Canaletto, two views of Venice\r\n      were bought by the National Gallery from the Beauconsin\r\n      Collection, but they were consigned to the National Gallery of\r\n      Dublin.\r\n\r\n\r\n2104. A MAN WITH A WIDE COLLAR.\r\n\r\n  _Enrico Fiammingo._\r\n\r\n      This painter of whom little is known, was a follower of\r\n      Spagnoletto and Guido.\r\n\r\n\r\n2105. A MAN WITH A POINTED BEARD.\r\n\r\n  _Annibale Carracci_ (Bolognese: 1560-1609). _See 9._\r\n\r\n\r\n2106. PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST.\r\n\r\n  _Benedetto Gennari_ (Bolognese: 1633-1715).\r\n\r\n      The artist was the nephew and scholar of Guercino. He came\r\n      to England in 1674, and was for some time in the service\r\n      of Charles II. and James II. \"I once saw,\" says Lanzi, \"a\r\n      Bathsheba of Guercino, along with a copy by one of the Gennari.\r\n      The former appeared as if newly painted at the time, and the\r\n      latter as if many years previously, such was its inferiority\r\n      in strength of hand.... Benedetto subsequently formed for\r\n      himself a style in England, more polished and careful, and\r\n      exemplified it more particularly in his portraits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2107. HAGAR IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n  _Salvator Rosa_ (Neapolitan: 1615-1673). _See 84._\r\n\r\n\r\n2118. MADONNA AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Giovanni Francesco da Rimini_ (Umbrian: dated 1406).\r\n\r\n\r\n2127. PORTRAIT OF THE MARCHESE GIOVANNI BATTISTA CATTANEO.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See 49._\r\n\r\nIt has been said in our notice of Van Dyck that many of his best works\r\nare to be seen in Genoa. Two of the portraits made during his \"Genoese\r\nperiod\" are now in our Gallery; having found their way to Paris and\r\nthence to England from the palace of the Marchese Cattaneo in Genoa,\r\nand having been bought by the Trustees from Messrs. Colnaghi. The\r\nprice paid for the picture before us was £13,500. The portrait has\r\nnot the pathetic charm of the \"Gevartius\" (52), to which it now forms\r\na pendant; but in strength and vitality it is one of the painter's\r\nmasterpieces. The Marchese lives before us, instinct with nervous\r\nenergy; seeming, as has been well said, \"at once to interrogate the\r\nspectator, and haughtily to repel interrogation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2129. UNE PARADE.\r\n\r\n  _Gabriel Jacques de Saint Aubin_ (French: 1724-1780).\r\n\r\n      A pupil of Boucher; painter, first of heroic and then of\r\n      domestic subjects; also an etcher.\r\n\r\nSpectators watching a turn with the foils by two mountebanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n2130. THE WATER LANE.\r\n\r\n  _Jan Siberechts_ (Flemish: 1627-1703).\r\n\r\n      It is very fitting that this painter, whose works in\r\n      Continental galleries are rare, should be represented in ours;\r\n      for it was the Duke of Buckingham, who brought him into\r\n      vogue. Passing through Antwerp, the Duke was attracted by his\r\n      work, and took him in his train to England, where, according\r\n      to Walpole, he was much employed by the aristocracy. \"Among\r\n      the landscapes of the Flemish school,\" says an enthusiastic\r\n      critic (A. J. Wauters), \"there is not one of whom we think more\r\n      highly. If his colouring lacks the brilliancy and the soft\r\n      transparency of the tones of Rubens, it offers others both\r\n      rare and unexpected at a time when the Flemish landscape was\r\n      yet enslaved by conventional laws. Sieberechts boldly met the\r\n      difficulties offered by open-air scenes and foreshadowed the\r\n      daring colouring attempted by modern realism. His landscapes\r\n      are true pastorals. He understood the art of giving his\r\n      farm-girls and hinds real attitudes, taken from life; and how\r\n      to make the various hues of vermilion and silver, blue and\r\n      yellow of their costumes harmonise boldly together, which makes\r\n      his works so charming, and gives them such a free and entirely\r\n      personal character.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2133, 2134. \"ROSES\" AND \"APPLES.\"\r\n\r\n  _Henri Fantin-Latour_ (French: 1836-1904). _See 1686._\r\n\r\n\r\n2135. THE MARSH OF ARLEUX-DU-NORD.\r\n\r\n  _J. B. C. Corot_ (French: 1796-1875).\r\n\r\n      Corot is one of those original painters who bring new aspects\r\n      of nature and modes of beauty into ken. He is usually classed\r\n      with the Barbizon School (see p. 691), but he stands alone with\r\n      a peculiarly subtle and individual note of his own. \"Rousseau,\"\r\n      he once said, \"is an eagle; I am only a lark.\" His mood, though\r\n      often tinged with melancholy, is tender, and delicate; what he\r\n      loved was not the grandiose in form or colour, but rather all\r\n      that was glimmering, uncertain, evanescent--such as the \"shade\r\n      by the light quivering aspen made,\" or delicate effects, at\r\n      early dawn, or in moonlight. To read his letter on \"the day of\r\n      a landscapist\"[260] is the best introduction to his art. \"One\r\n      rises early, at three o'clock in the morning before the sun is\r\n      up, one goes and sits down at the foot of a tree, one looks and\r\n      waits; he does not see much at first. Nature resembles a white\r\n      tablecloth, where he can hardly distinguish the profiles of\r\n      some of the masses. Everything is scented, everything trembles\r\n      with the fresh breeze of the dawn.\" And then, again, when the\r\n      sun has set: \"Bien! bien! twilight commences. There is now\r\n      in the sky only that soft vaporous colour of pale citron.\r\n      One is losing sight of everything, but one still feels that\r\n      everything is there. The birds, those voices of the flowers,\r\n      say their evening prayer, the dew scatters pearls upon the\r\n      grass, the nymphs fly ... everything is again darkened; the\r\n      pond alone glitters. Good, there is my picture completed.\" It\r\n      was only gradually that Corot reached the style upon which\r\n      his fame rests. He was born in Paris of humble parents, and\r\n      served for some years in a draper's shop. He was twenty-two\r\n      before he was able to follow his artistic bent. He made the\r\n      usual classical tour to Italy, and it was not till 1843 that\r\n      he began to reveal the characteristic charm which he had found\r\n      in French landscape. He painted what few eyes are wont to see\r\n      and had to create the taste by which he was to be admired. But\r\n      affluence came to him, and he gave as readily as he received.\r\n      Many stories are told of his benevolence, and the love which he\r\n      inspired is recorded in the title, \"le père Corot,\" by which\r\n      he was called. As a mark of their esteem his fellow-artists\r\n      presented him with a gold medal shortly before his death. His\r\n      last words were characteristic of his art and his life. It was\r\n      his practice to sketch early and late in the open air, dreaming\r\n      his pictures as he studied, and to \"paint his dreams\" in the\r\n      studio. \"Last night,\" he said as he lay on his death-bed,\r\n      \"I saw in a dream a landscape with a rosy sky; it will be\r\n      marvellous to paint.\" He was seen to draw in the air with his\r\n      fingers. \"_Mon Dieu_\" he said, \"how beautiful that is; the most\r\n      beautiful landscape I have ever seen.\" His old housekeeper\r\n      offered to bring him his breakfast. He smiled and said, \"To-day\r\n      Père Corot will breakfast above.\"\r\n\r\nThis little picture is characteristic of one of Corot's tastes. \"He\r\nloved,\" we are told, \"water in indetermined clearness and in the\r\nshining glance of light, leaving it here in shadow and touching it\r\nthere with brightness. He loved morning before sunrise, when the white\r\nmists hover over pools like a light veil of gauze; he had a passion for\r\nevening which was almost greater; he loved the softer vapours which\r\ngather in the gloom.\" (Muther.) The picture was painted in 1871, and\r\nwas purchased by Fantin-Latour at the posthumous sale of Corot's works.\r\n\r\n\r\n2136. ENGRAVED PORTRAIT OF LULLY, THE MUSICIAN. _See 2081._\r\n\r\n\r\n2143. LADY STANDING BY A SPINET.\r\n\r\n  _Jacob Ochtervelt_ (Dutch: died before 1710).\r\n\r\n      Jacob Ochtervelt (sometimes called wrongly Jan, and Achtervelt\r\n      or Uchtervelt) was born probably at Rotterdam. He formed\r\n      his style on the model of Terburg, to whom his pictures are\r\n      sometimes attributed (see, for instance, an example in the\r\n      Venice Academy formerly given to Terburg).\r\n\r\nA beautiful example of a painter, by whom pictures in good condition\r\nare rare--a harmony in pink and grey and brown. There is poetical\r\nfeeling, too, in the lady's attitude and the man who looks up intently\r\nat her; as also some humour in the dog turning his attention to an\r\nintruder.\r\n\r\n\r\n2144. LA MARCHESA CATTANEO.\r\n\r\n  _Van Dyck_ (Flemish: 1599-1641). _See 49._\r\n\r\nA companion picture to No. 2127.\r\n\r\n\r\n2162. PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST.\r\n\r\n  _Joseph Ducreux_ (French: 1735-1802).\r\n\r\nThe artist is dressed as a French Abbé, with powdered hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n2163. THE MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Mabuse_ (Flemish: 1470-1541). _See 656._\r\n\r\n\r\n2204. INTERIOR OF A CHURCH.\r\n\r\n  _Hendrick Steenwyck_ (Flemish: 1580-1649). _See 1132._\r\n\r\nDated 1615. The nave of a Gothic church; in the distance a funeral\r\nprocession is entering the choir; beggars and dogs in the foreground.\r\n\r\n\r\n2205. INTERIOR OF A CHURCH.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Neeffs_ (Flemish: 1577-1661). _See 924._\r\n\r\nA night scene in a church of Renaissance architecture. On a tomb on the\r\nfloor is an inscription--\"632 Hier legt begraven Henri Steenwick.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2206. VESPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n2207. AFTER VESPERS.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Neeffs._\r\n\r\nThe chapel in No. 2207 is the same as that on the left in No. 2206.\r\n\r\n\r\n2209. ULRICUS SIROSENIUS, DUKE OF EAST FRIESLAND.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelissen_ (Dutch: about 1475-1555). _See 657._\r\n\r\nThe title is written on the back of the oak panel. The Duke's sword is\r\ninscribed--\"Victor est qui nomen Domini pugnavit.\" Among other versions\r\nof this portrait is one in the Oldenburg Gallery, attributed to Lucas\r\nvan Leyden. Another (in the Duke of Rutland's collection) has Dürer's\r\nmonogram.\r\n\r\n\r\n2211. JACQUELINE DE BOURGOGNE.\r\n\r\n  _Mabuse_ (Flemish: about 1470-1541). _See 656._\r\n\r\nThe beautiful costume and jewellery should be noticed; the girl holds\r\nan orrery. This picture was shown in the Golden Fleece Exhibition at\r\nBruges in 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n2216. \"LA MAIN CHAUDE.\"\r\n\r\n  _Jean François de Troy_ (French: 1679-1752).\r\n\r\n      This painter (pupil of his father, François de Troy) was\r\n      employed by Louis XIV. to execute designs for tapestry in the\r\n      grand style, and he carved out much decorative work. Sets\r\n      of some of the tapestries from his designs are in the State\r\n      Apartments in Windsor Castle. Subsequently, he adopted the\r\n      style of Watteau, and painted \"conversations galantes,\" such\r\n      as in the example before us. Other specimens of his work may\r\n      be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and in the Wallace\r\n      collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n2217. ELISA BONAPARTE, GRAND DUCHESS OF TUSCANY.\r\n\r\n  _J. L. David_ (French: 1748-1825).\r\n\r\n      Jacques Louis David, the founder of the \"classical school\"\r\n      in France and for many years the Dictator of French art,\r\n      was a nephew of Boucher, from whom he received his first\r\n      instruction. His celebrated \"Oath of the Horatii\" (1784)\r\n      and \"Brutus\" (1789), and other works of the kind, are in the\r\n      Louvre. They were not without influence on the politics of the\r\n      time, and David was elected a representative of Paris in the\r\n      Convention in 1792. He became a follower of Robespierre, and\r\n      naturally escaped execution. Abandoning politics, he became\r\n      acquainted with Napoleon, who made him his First Painter.\r\n      On the restoration of the Bourbons, he sought refuge in\r\n      Brussels, where he died. Many of his Napoleonic pictures are at\r\n      Versailles.\r\n\r\nA vigorous portrait-sketch of Elisa, sister of Napoleon, whom he made\r\nDuchess of Tuscany, with the titles of Duchess of Lucca and Princess\r\nof Piombino. She was born in 1777 and died in 1820. We see her here in\r\nwhite empire costume.\r\n\r\n\r\n2218. MADAME MALIBRAN.\r\n\r\n  _J. A. D. Ingres_ (French: 1780-1867).\r\n\r\nA study of the famous singer; attributed to Jean Auguste Dominique\r\nIngres, a pupil of David, who imparted a grace of his own to the\r\nClassical School.\r\n\r\n\r\n2251. PORTRAIT OF BONA OF SAVOY.\r\n\r\n  _Ambrogio de Predis_ (Milanese: about 1450-1515). _See 1661._\r\n\r\nThis striking full-length figure of a lady, richly attired and wearing\r\njewels, was No. 7 in the exhibition of pictures by Milanese masters\r\nat the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1894. It was then described as a\r\nportrait of Beatrice d'Este.\r\n\r\n\r\n2256. RIVER SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n2257. ILEX TREES, VILLEFRANCHE.\r\n\r\n  _Henri Harpignies_ (French: born 1819).\r\n\r\n      These two pictures, recently presented to the Gallery, are\r\n      slight examples of the work, in oil and water-colour, of an\r\n      artist who travelled with Corot and continued that master's\r\n      method of interpreting nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n2258. A WOODLAND SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Georges Michel_ (French: 1763-1843).\r\n\r\nA good example of an artist who has been called \"the Ruysdael of\r\nMontmartre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2281. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo Lotto_ (Venetian: 1480-1556). _See 699._\r\n\r\nThe Virgin, a pretty woman prettily dressed, is seated between St.\r\nJerome and St. Anthony of Padua, who holds in his hand a \"Madonna\r\nlily.\" This bright and dainty picture belongs to the year 1522 (see\r\nBerenson's _Lorenzo Lotto_, 1895, p. 187).\r\n\r\n\r\n2282. THE BOHEMIANS.\r\n\r\n  _Philips Wouwerman_ (Dutch: 1619-1668). _See 878._\r\n\r\n\r\n2283. DAWN.\r\n\r\n  _Aart van der Neer_ (Dutch: 1603-1677). _See 152._\r\n\r\n\r\n2285. A FAMILY GROUP.\r\n\r\n  _Frans Hals_ (Dutch: 1580-1666). _See 1021._\r\n\r\nAn important accession to the Gallery, as an example of the large\r\nportrait-groups in which Hals excelled. The composition whereby the ten\r\nfigures are all brought into a group is ingenious--the part played by\r\nthe direction of the elder boy's attention to the other being in this\r\nrespect important--though in colour the harmony is somewhat disturbed\r\nby the emphatic lights of the lace and linen worn by each member of\r\nthe group. There is individual character in all the portraits; among\r\nthe figures which most compel admiration are those of the mother, full\r\nof quiet dignity, of the eldest daughter, standing on the right with a\r\nwork-basket in her hand (both beautifully painted), and of the little\r\ngirl seated in front. The picture unknown to the connoisseurs before\r\nits acquisition for the National Gallery--was purchased in 1908 from\r\nLord Talbot de Malahide for £25,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n2288. PORTRAIT OF DR. FORLENZE.\r\n\r\n  _Jacques Antoine Vallin_ (French: 1770-1838).\r\n\r\nDr. J. N. B. Forlenze (1769-1833) was a physician and man of fashion\r\nin Naples. He had visited England and studied under John Hunter; and\r\npractised as an oculist in Paris. This portrait was exhibited at the\r\nSalon in 1808.\r\n\r\n\r\n2289. ATTILA: AN ALLEGORY.\r\n\r\n  _F. V. E. Delacroix_ (French: 1798-1863).\r\n\r\n      Ferdinand Victor Eugène Delacroix was the chief of the\r\n      \"Romantic\" school in painting, which in literature was\r\n      represented by de Musset, George Sand, and Victor Hugo. The\r\n      Romanticists revolted against the art of the Classicists as\r\n      cold, formal, and colourless. Delacroix, whose admiration\r\n      was for Byron in poetry and for Rubens in painting, sought\r\n      before all things passion, emotion, and colour. He had, says\r\n      Silvestre, \"the sun in his head and a thunderstorm in his\r\n      heart, and his grandiose and awe-inspiring brush sounded the\r\n      entire gamut of human emotion.\" He loved strong colour, and he\r\n      was one of many French artists who were influenced by the sight\r\n      of Constable's pictures in the Salon. His pictures were as\r\n      fiercely assailed, as they were furiously painted. \"It is the\r\n      massacre of painting,\" said Baron Gros of Delacroix's \"Massacre\r\n      of Chios.\" \"I became the abomination of painting,\" said the\r\n      artist, \"I was refused water and salt;\" but, he added, \"I was\r\n      enchanted with myself,\" and he won his way into favour. He was\r\n      born at Charenton St. Maurice, near Paris. His father, who\r\n      held high office under the First Empire, had been a partisan\r\n      of the violent faction during the Revolution, and, like some\r\n      other revolutionaries, was more consumed with public ardour\r\n      than concerned with private affairs. The boy was exposed to\r\n      accidents and neglect in his childhood which make one wonder\r\n      that he survived. He had poor health throughout life, and there\r\n      was in him a hectic strain which was reflected in his art. In\r\n      1817 he entered the studio of Guérin, where he had Ary Scheffer\r\n      (see 1169) for a fellow-pupil and antagonist, and afterwards\r\n      he worked under Baron Gros. He was deeply stirred by the War\r\n      of Greek Independence; and a visit which he paid to Morocco\r\n      and Algiers in 1831 had the effect of enriching his sense of\r\n      colour. He had a strong supporter in Thiers, through whose\r\n      influence he received many important commissions for public\r\n      works--in the decoration of the Louvre, the Luxembourg, and the\r\n      Chamber of Deputies. Our picture was a design for the latter.\r\n      These and other large works occupied him till 1855; and at last\r\n      in 1857 he was admitted into the French Academy.\r\n\r\nIn this characteristic design the spirit of Ruthless Conquest is\r\npersonified in the figure of Attila, the leader of the Huns, called\r\n\"The Scourge of God.\" He drives before him, beneath a blood-red sky and\r\namid the ghosts of the slain, figures emblematic of Beauty, Art, and\r\nPleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n2290. PARC DE SANSAC, INDRE-ET-LOIRE.\r\n\r\n  _Armand Charnay_ (French: born 1844).\r\n\r\n      Jean Marie Armand Charnay, born at Charlieu (Loire); in 1864\r\n      entered the École des Beaux-Arts; genre and landscape painter.\r\n\r\nThis picture of autumn in the walks of a French château was presented\r\nby the artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n2291. PORTRAIT OF CARDINAL DE RETZ.\r\n\r\n  _Philippe de Champaigne_ (French: 1602-1674). _See 798._\r\n\r\nA portrait, in Cardinal's cape and skull-cap, of Jean François Paul\r\nde Gondi (1614-1679), Archbishop of Paris, and afterwards Cardinal de\r\nRetz. As Archbishop, he aided the rising of the Fronde against Mazarin.\r\nIn 1652 he was arrested and imprisoned; he escaped, and for some years\r\nwandered abroad. In 1662 he was received into favour by Louis XIV.,\r\nand in his later years was often employed as an envoy to Rome. He is\r\ndescribed as having been in his youth short, near-sighted, ugly, and\r\nexceedingly awkward.\r\n\r\n\r\n2292. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Michiel Jansz van Mirevelt_ (Dutch: 1567-1641).\r\n\r\n      Mirevelt (or Miereveld) was the son of an engraver on precious\r\n      metals at Delft, and was trained as an engraver. He afterwards\r\n      entered the studio of Blocklandt at Utrecht, and devoted\r\n      himself to historical painting, still-life, and other subjects.\r\n      Presently he painted the portraits of some of the princes of\r\n      the House of Nassau, and these were so much admired that he\r\n      came into continuous request in that branch of art. Sandrart\r\n      relates that Mirevelt claimed to have painted nearly 10,000\r\n      portraits; doubtless an exaggeration, but \"it may be said that\r\n      it was he who made the custom of having portraits painted\r\n      general in the United Provinces. His painting, thin, clean\r\n      finished, and rather cold, was intended to please his elegant\r\n      clients\" (Havard).\r\n\r\nThis lady's stomacher embroidered with rows of pearls and pleated lace\r\nruff are finely painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n2293. HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  Ascribed to _Luca Penni_ (Roman: born about 1500).\r\n\r\n      One of the scholars and assistants of Raphael; after whose\r\n      death Penni is said to have attached himself to Perino del\r\n      Vaga. Subsequently he became an engraver.\r\n\r\n\r\n2294. PORTRAIT OF GALILEO.\r\n\r\n  _Passignano_ (Florentine: 1558-1638).\r\n\r\n      Domenico Cresti, called Il Passignano from his native place,\r\n      a village near Florence, was a pupil of Zuccaro. Moving to\r\n      Venice, he studied for a while under Paolo Veronese, whose\r\n      works he greatly admired and whose manner he followed. His\r\n      facility and rapidity caused a play upon his surname, and he\r\n      was called \"Passa ognuno.\"\r\n\r\nThe great astronomer (1564-1642) is represented with astrolabe, books,\r\ndiagram, and compasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n2295. PORTRAIT OF A MILITARY COMMANDER.\r\n\r\n  _Frans Pourbus, the younger_ (Flemish: 1569-1622).\r\n\r\n      Pourbus, son of Frans Pourbus the elder, was born at Antwerp,\r\n      and by 1591 was a master in the Guild of St. Luke. He was\r\n      employed by the Archduke Albert at Antwerp, at whose court\r\n      he attracted the notice of the Duke of Mantua. The Duke took\r\n      him into his service (1600-1609), and he shared with Rubens\r\n      the title of Painter to the Ducal Court. At Mantua he worked\r\n      at \"a collection of the most beautiful women in the world,\r\n      whether princesses or private ladies.\" Like Rubens, Pourbus was\r\n      occasionally employed as Ambassador, and a mission to Paris\r\n      caused him to forsake Italy for France. Eleanor of Mantua was\r\n      a sister of Marie de' Medici, and Pourbus finally settled in\r\n      Paris as Painter to the Queen. There is a portrait of the queen\r\n      by him at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n2423. LITHOGRAPHS OF HORSES.\r\n\r\n  _J. L. A. T. Géricault_ (French: 1791-1824).\r\n\r\n      Jean Louis André Théodore Géricault, animal and historical\r\n      painter, was a precursor of the revolt of the Romanticists\r\n      against the Classicists, which was carried further by Delacroix\r\n      (see 2289). His most famous picture, \"The Raft of the Medusa\"\r\n      (Louvre), was exhibited at the Salon in 1819 and excited much\r\n      controversy. He was the son of a prosperous advocate; and as\r\n      a young man became a member of the Jockey Club, and lived the\r\n      life of the _jeunesse dorée_. He had some instruction in art\r\n      from Charles Vernet and Guérin, but his real master was Rubens\r\n      in the Louvre. In 1816 he went to Italy. After 1819 he visited\r\n      England, where he practised the then new art of lithography.\r\n      His picture of \"The Derby at Epsom\" (1821) is in the Louvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n2439. A RIVER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _P. E. Théodore Rousseau_ (French: 1812-1867).\r\n\r\n      Rousseau, one of the founders of the modern school of\r\n      landscape in France, had to fight his way to fame through\r\n      many difficulties and much neglect. The toast of Diaz, \"à\r\n      notre maître oublié,\" has been already recorded (p. 691).\r\n      For thirteen years (1835-1848) his pictures were rejected\r\n      from the Salon; and official honours came to him tardily. He\r\n      had his revenge in the Exhibition of 1855, when his rejected\r\n      pictures \"came back as victorious exiles,\" and again in that\r\n      of 1867, when he was chosen president of the jury. But he\r\n      was of a sensitive and jealous disposition; he was estranged\r\n      from his best friend, Dupré, and chagrin at being passed over\r\n      for promotion in the Legion of Honour in 1867 is said to\r\n      have hastened his death. A pleasanter episode in his life is\r\n      his generous and timely help to Millet. The heads of the two\r\n      artists are carved together on his tombstone in the cemetery\r\n      of Chailly, near Barbizon. He was born in Paris, the son of a\r\n      merchant-tailor. He studied painting under Rémond and Guillon\r\n      Lethière, and first exhibited at the Salon in 1831. His\r\n      pictures in successive years were loudly trumpeted by Thoré as\r\n      those of an innovator, and for that reason perhaps excited the\r\n      more hostility among the old school. His favourite ground was\r\n      the forest of Fontainebleau, and he made his home at Barbizon,\r\n      studying every aspect of nature with intense application. \"It\r\n      is a good composition,\" he wrote, \"when the objects represented\r\n      are not there solely as they are, but when they contain under\r\n      a natural appearance the sentiments which they have stirred in\r\n      our souls. If we contest that the trees have power of thought,\r\n      at any rate we may allow that they can make us think; and in\r\n      return for all the modesty of which they make use to elevate\r\n      our thoughts, we owe them, as recompense, not arrogant freedom\r\n      or pedantic and classic style, but the sincerity of a grateful\r\n      attention in the reproduction of their being.\" There is a good\r\n      example of his forest-pictures in the Wallace Collection.\r\n\r\nRousseau was the most various of the landscape painters of his time.\r\nIn the present picture we see him in a peaceful mood; another picture\r\n(2635) is of a stormy sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n2475. CHRISTINA, DUCHESS OF MILAN.\r\n\r\n  _Hans Holbein_ (German: 1497-1543). _See 1314._\r\n\r\nAmongst Holbein's duties as painter to Henry VIII. was that of taking\r\nportraits of the ladies whom he proposed in turn to wed. After the\r\ndeath of Jane Seymour, the first favourite was the lady before us, \"the\r\ndemure half-smile not yet faded from her eyes\"--Christina, daughter\r\nof Christian II. of Denmark, niece of the Emperor Charles V., and\r\nwidow of the Duke of Milan. Reasons of state suggested her marriage\r\nto Henry VIII., and Holbein was sent to Brussels, where the Duchess\r\nwas residing. Our portrait was painted a few years later than \"The\r\nAmbassadors,\" from a sketch made at Brussels on March 12, 1538. The\r\ncircumstances are entertainingly told in the letters of the English\r\nenvoy, John Hutton, to Thomas Cromwell. On the 10th August Hutton\r\nhad sent off a portrait by another artist to Henry VIII., that he\r\nmight judge of the appearance of the young Duchess before making her\r\na proposal of marriage. The next evening \"Mr. Haunce\" (_i.e._ Hans\r\nHolbein) arrived in company of a servant of the king, whereupon Hutton\r\nsent off an express-courier to fetch back the picture he had already\r\ndespatched, \"for that in my opinion,\" he said, \"it was not so perfect\r\nas the case required, neither as the said Mr. Haunce could make it.\"\r\n\"The next day following at one of the clock in the afternoon, the\r\nsaid Lord Benedick came for Mr. Haunce, who, having but three hours'\r\nspace, both showed himself to be master of that science, for it is very\r\nperfect; the other is but slobbered in comparison to it, as, by the\r\nsight of both, your Lordships shall well perceive.\"\r\n\r\nThe original--the study, sketch, or miniature, the result of\r\nthree hours' hard work--has disappeared; but the picture which\r\nthe master made from it after he came home is now before us. The\r\nportrait, it would seem, did not make the king less anxious for the\r\nmatch--which, however, was broken off, it will be remembered, after\r\nlong negotiations, by the hostility of the emperor. The duchess, in\r\nspite of her tender years, seems--and the picture does not belie the\r\nsupposition--to have had a character of her own. The story of her\r\nreply, \"that she had but one head, but that if she had two, one should\r\nbe at the service of his majesty,\" is, indeed, now discredited; but\r\nher actual answer, \"You know I am the Emperor's poor servant and\r\nmust follow his pleasure,\" was, in the light of subsequent events,\r\nequally to the point. The English envoy specially reported \"her honest\r\ncountenance and the few words she wisely spoke.\"\r\n\r\nThe beautiful portrait before us was retained by Henry VIII., and\r\nthrough the Lumley, Pembroke, and Arundel Collections it passed\r\ninto that of the Dukes of Norfolk. \"Whether as a pictorial record\r\nof an interesting chapter of our history, or as an example of the\r\npresentment of a fresh and winning young personality by the most\r\nmasterful and at the same time most reserved and refined methods of the\r\npainter's craft, the picture counts among the very noblest of the art\r\ntreasures still left in England. That it is so left is mainly due to\r\nthe splendid generosity of a small group of private donors, the chief\r\nof whom elude our public thanks by choosing firmly to remain anonymous.\r\nAt the eleventh hour, when the picture was on the very point of leaving\r\nour shores to enrich a private gallery in America, these benefactors\r\ncame forward and enabled the Committee of the National Art-Collections'\r\nFund to present the masterpiece to the nation.\" The price paid was\r\n£72,000. (_Report of the National Art-Collections' Fund_, 1909;\r\nFroude's _History of England_, ch. xv.) The picture had for many years\r\nbeen lent to the National Gallery by the Duke of Norfolk.[261]\r\n\r\n\r\n2480. THE FISH MARKET.\r\n\r\n  _Philippe Rousseau_ (French: 1816-1887).\r\n\r\n      Born in Paris; first exhibited at the Salon in 1834, \"A View in\r\n      Normandy\"; afterwards made his reputation, and attained great\r\n      popularity as a painter of still-life.\r\n\r\n\r\n2482. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Benvenuto da Siena_ (Sienese: 1436-1518).\r\n\r\nThis painter is better seen in the larger picture, No. 909.\r\n\r\n\r\n2483. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Fiorenzo di Lorenzo_ (Umbrian: 1440-1521).\r\n\r\n\r\n2484. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _L'Ingegno_ (Umbrian: painted 1484-1511). _See 1220._\r\n\r\nThe donor and his wife kneel in adoration before the Virgin and Child\r\nenthroned between St. Dominic and St. Catherine of Siena. The picture\r\nwas formerly in Lord Dudley's collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n2485. SALOME.\r\n\r\n  _Cesare da Sesto_ (Lombard: 1477-1523).\r\n\r\n      Leonardo da Vinci was \"very successfully installed,\" says\r\n      Vasari, \"by Cesare da Sesto, who was also a Milanese.\" Cesare\r\n      was born at Sesto Calende on the Lago Maggiore, and is supposed\r\n      to have worked under Leonardo in Milan, 1507-1512. At Rome he\r\n      was, according to Lomazzo, an intimate friend of Raphael.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Herodias, with a face of haunting beauty, points to a\r\nvase, over which the executioner holds the head of John the Baptist.\r\nThe table on which it rests has sphinxes for supports. This picture is\r\na replica with variations of the one by Cesare in the Vienna Gallery,\r\nand is said to have come from the Barberini Palace in 1799.\r\n\r\n\r\n2486. A CONCERT.\r\n\r\n  _Ercole Roberti de' Grandi_ (Ferrarese: 1450-1496). _See 1127._\r\n\r\nThis picture was No. 14 at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1894, where\r\nit was ascribed to Lorenzo Costa. \"In type, the woman resembles one\r\nof the daughters of Bentivoglio II., and it may be that this group\r\nof musicians contains family portraits of the reigning house of the\r\nBentivogli at Bologna.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2487. BARTOLOMMEO BIANCHINI.\r\n\r\n  _Francia_ (Bolognese: 1450-1517). _See 180._\r\n\r\nThis picture, an early work by Francia, is an admirable example of\r\nthe artist as a portrait-painter. It is \"a marvel of fine condition,\r\nand betrays the technique of the goldsmith seeking for the quality of\r\nenamel. Bianchini was a Bolognese senator, collector, poet, and friend\r\nof Francia.\" Upon a \"Holy Family\" in the Berlin Museum is inscribed--\r\n\r\n  Bartholomei sumptu Bianchini maxima matrum\r\n  Hic vivit manibus, Francia, picta tuis.\r\n\r\nOur portrait, from the collection of the Princesse de Sagan, was No. 23\r\nat the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n2488. THE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Luca Signorelli_ (Cortona: 1441-1523). _See 1128._\r\n\r\n\r\n2489. THE YOUNG FLORENTINE.\r\n\r\n  _Domenico Ghirlandajo_ (Florentine: 1449-1494). _See 1230._\r\n\r\nThe portrait of the man in his red-coloured robe and black skull-cap\r\nis set against a landscape background. Many other examples of a like\r\ntreatment will have been noticed by the visitor; as, for instance, in\r\nthe fine portrait by Ridolfo Ghirlandajo (2491). And it is interesting\r\nto observe how long this convention survived, though with variations.\r\nThe advantage of introducing an object of locally dark colour behind\r\nthe head was perceived, and a background of curtain or other drapery\r\nwas used; but a piece of it was drawn back, so as still to display\r\nlandscape. See, _e.g._, Basaiti's portrait (2498). Or, again, a window\r\nwas opened with the same purpose. See, _e.g._, Piombo's portrait of\r\na Venetian lady as Salome (2493) and Cariani's of a Venetian magnate\r\n(2494). A corresponding development may be traced in Madonna pictures.\r\nOften the Virgin and Child are placed in an open landscape, as in the\r\nbeautiful \"Madonna of the Meadow\" (599). When they are brought indoors\r\na curtain is drawn back (2503), or a window opened--_e.g._ 2496, 2609,\r\nand (Flemish School) 2595.\r\n\r\n\r\n2490. COSTANZA DE' MEDICI.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo di Credi_ (Florentine: 1459-1537). _See 593._\r\n\r\nThe inscription records that the lady was the wife of Francis, Duke of\r\nGaeta. This portrait was formerly ascribed to D. Ghirlandajo.\r\n\r\n\r\n2491. GIROLAMO BENEVIENI.\r\n\r\n  _Ridolfo Ghirlandajo_ (Florentine: 1483-1561). _See 1143._\r\n\r\nThis fine portrait is of \"a very learned man,\" and an intimate friend\r\nof Lorenzo di Credi, who also, as Vasari relates, painted him. The\r\nbackground is studied from that in Leonardo's \"Mona Lisa.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2492. VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH ANGELS ADORING.\r\n\r\n  _Jacopo del Sellaio_ (Florentine: 1442-1493).\r\n\r\n      This painter is mentioned by Vasari as among the pupils of Fra\r\n      Filippo Lippi. He worked in the manner of Botticelli, and No.\r\n      916 in our gallery is now ascribed to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n2493. SALOME.\r\n\r\n  _Sebastiano del Piombo_ (Venetian: 1485-1547). _See 1._\r\n\r\n\r\n2494. AN ITALIAN GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Cariani_ (Bergamese: about 1480-1541). _See 1203._\r\n\r\nA vigorously-painted portrait of a personage of some importance or\r\nself-importance; perhaps, as the official catalogue suggests, \"the\r\nprincipal citizen of some provincial town.\" His robe is of gold\r\nbrocade, and he handles his gold chain. It may be a view of his town\r\nthat is shown through the open window.\r\n\r\n\r\n2495. \"OUR LADY OF THE LAURELS.\"\r\n\r\n  _Cariani_ (Bergamese: about 1480-1541). _See 1203._\r\n\r\nThis fine picture, known as _La Vierge aux Lauriers_ from its\r\nbackground of a laurel-bush (and roses), was formerly in the\r\nLeuchtenberg Collection at St. Petersburg, where it was ascribed to\r\nGiorgione.\r\n\r\n\r\n2496. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Beltraffio_ (Lombard: 1467-1516). _See 728._\r\n\r\n\r\n2497. VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH ST. JOHN.\r\n\r\n  _School of Botticelli_ (Florentine: 1447-1510). _See 1034._\r\n\r\n\r\n2498. A YOUNG VENETIAN.\r\n\r\n  _Marco Basaiti_ (Venetian: painted 1500-1521). _See 281._\r\n\r\nSigned on the parapet. The young Venetians, it will be noticed, wore\r\ntheir hair long, and carried great weights of it at the sides of their\r\nfaces: compare, _e.g._, No. 1121 (Catena), 2509 (Vivarini).\r\n\r\n\r\n2499. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Marco Basaiti_ (Venetian: painted 1500-1521).\r\n\r\nThis picture, if No. 599 be indeed by the same hand, must be an early\r\nwork; the face and figure, both of mother and of child, are ugly and\r\nungainly. The picture is signed in the left corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n2500. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Andrea Previtali_ (Bergamese: about 1480-1528). _See 695._\r\n\r\n\r\n2501. SALVATOR MUNDI.\r\n\r\n  _Previtali_ (Bergamese: about 1480-1528). _See 695._\r\n\r\nInscribed on the parapet \"Andreas Privitalus, p.\" and dated 1518.\r\n\r\n\r\n2502. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Bastiano Mainardi_ (Tuscan: died 1513).\r\n\r\n      This painter was the pupil, favourite assistant, and\r\n      brother-in-law of Domenico Ghirlandajo (see 1230). He was born\r\n      at San Gimignano, in the churches of which place pictures by\r\n      him are to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful painting of jewellery, and the fine patterns, should not\r\nescape notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n2503. HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _Antonio da Solario_ (Venetian: 15th-16th century).\r\n\r\nThis beautiful picture is signed on a cartellino \"Antonius da Solario\r\nV\"(enetus).\r\n\r\n\r\n2504. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Cesare da Sesto_ (Milanese: 1477-1523). _See 2485._\r\n\r\n\r\n2505. DAVID AND JONATHAN.\r\n\r\n  _Cima da Conegliano_ (Venetian: 1460-1518). _See 300._\r\n\r\nThis little picture, of David (carrying the head of Goliath) walking\r\nwith Jonathan, was formerly in the Modici collection at Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n2506. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Cima_ (Venetian: 1460-1518).\r\n\r\nFormerly in the Patrizi collection at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n2507. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Bartolommeo Veneziano_ (painted 1505-1530). _See 287._\r\n\r\nFrom the Castellani collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n2508. VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Florentine School: 15th century).\r\n\r\nTwo charming angels, of whom one is garlanded with roses, hold the\r\nchild before the Virgin. The scene is laid within the walls of the\r\nmystical garden (\"a garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse\"), behind\r\nwhich rise \"Noah's ark\" trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n2509. PORTRAIT OF A YOUTH.\r\n\r\n  _Alvise Vivarini_ (Venetian: painted 1461-1503). _See 1872._\r\n\r\n\"The portrait of a boy of fifteen or sixteen, a little defiant or shy,\r\nyet frank in look, with a blond _zazzera_ (head of hair) cropped short\r\nover the eyebrows, wearing a coat of pale turquoise blue. Formerly\r\nin the Duchatel collection at Paris, where it was seen by Messrs.\r\nCrowe and Cavalcaselle.\" By them ascribed to Andrea da Solario (see\r\n734); formerly, to Antonello (see 673); now, on the authority of Mr.\r\nBerenson, to Alvise: see Berenson's _Lorenzo Lotto_, pp. 110-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n2510. A PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Umbrian School: 15th century).\r\n\r\nPossibly a portrait of the young Raphael.\r\n\r\n\r\n2511. A MUSICIAN.\r\n\r\n  _Giulio Campi_ (Cremona: 1502-1572).\r\n\r\n      A master at the School of Cremona, who worked in the great\r\n      church there with Boccaccino (see 806). There are also works by\r\n      him at Mantua, where he is said to have studied under Giulio\r\n      Romano.\r\n\r\n\r\n2512. THE MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Correggio_ (Parmese: 1494-1534). _See 10._\r\n\r\n\"The art of Correggio with its deep sense of beauty and its tender\r\nsensibility was peculiarly fitted,\" says Signor Ricci, \"to give life\r\nand grace to the figure of the Magdalen. He introduced it in many of\r\nhis large compositions, and made it the subject of several separate\r\nstudies, but not one of the latter has survived.\" If this be an\r\nauthentic work, the statement requires correction; but the head of the\r\nMagdalen is not convincingly Correggiesque.\r\n\r\n\r\n2513. VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH SAINTS.\r\n\r\n  _Tiepolo_ (Venetian: 1692-1769). _See 1192._\r\n\r\n\r\n2514-2516. VIEWS IN VENICE.\r\n\r\n  _Canaletto_ (Venetian: 1697-1768). _See 127._\r\n\r\nNo. 2514 shows the Grand Canal, with the church of the Scalzi; No.\r\n2515, the square of St. Mark's, seen through an archway; No. 2516,\r\nthe Colonnade of the Procuratie Nuove. The white spots with which\r\nthe figures are picked out are not a happy instance of Canaletto's\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\n\r\n2517-2523. VARIOUS VIEWS.\r\n\r\n  _Guardi_ (Venetian: 1712-1793). _See 210._\r\n\r\nNo. 2517, \"Buildings and Figures\"; 2518, \"Gothic Archway and Figures\";\r\n2519, \"Venetian Courtyard\"; 2520, \"Quay-side with Warehouses\"; 2521,\r\n\"Ruins\"; 2522, \"Treasure-Seekers\"; 2523, \"View through an Archway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2524. THE TOWER OF MESTRE.\r\n\r\n  _Guardi_ (Venetian: 1712-1793). _See 210._\r\n\r\nIt was at Mestre that travellers in old days took gondola for Venice,\r\nand the tower was a familiar landmark. Ruskin mentions it in his\r\ndescription of the approach to Venice (_Stones_, vol. i. last chapter).\r\n\r\n\r\n2525. VENICE: PIAZZA DI SAN MARCO.\r\n\r\n  _Guardi_ (Venetian: 1712-1793).\r\n\r\nA good example of the deep, rich colour which Guardi gives to his\r\nVenetian subjects: see under 210.\r\n\r\n\r\n2526. PEASANT AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Spanish: 17th century).\r\n\r\n      This unfinished picture (once in the collection of the Earl\r\n      of Clare) has been ascribed to Pedro Nuñez de Villavicencio\r\n      (1630-1700). He was a Knight of the Order of St. John of\r\n      Jerusalem, a distinguished amateur-painter and a favourite\r\n      pupil of Murillo, who died in his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n2527. CHARLES MORDAUNT, EARL OF MONMOUTH.\r\n\r\n  _Juan Giacchinetti Gonzalez_ (Spanish: 1630-1696).\r\n\r\n      A portrait-painter, who was a great admirer of Titian and a\r\n      diligent copyist of his works. He was the son of a Burgundian\r\n      jeweller settled at Madrid, and he was born in that city.\r\n      He removed to Italy, where he was called, from his skill in\r\n      portraiture, _Il Borgognone dalle teste_ (the Burgundian of the\r\n      heads). He practised his art in Brescia and Bergamo, and died\r\n      in the latter city.\r\n\r\n\r\n2528. THE MAN WITH THE GLOVE.\r\n\r\n  _Frans Hals_ (Dutch: 1580-1666). _See 1021._\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of the \"irresistible verve\" which Hals brings to\r\nhis portraits, especially to those of men: see under 1021. To what is\r\nthere said, it may be interesting to add the opinion of Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds. \"In the work of Frank Hals, the portrait-painter may observe\r\nthe composition of a face, the features well put together, as the\r\npainters express it; from whence proceeds that strong-marked character\r\nof individual nature, which is so remarkable in his portraits, and is\r\nnot found in an equal degree in any other painter. If he had joined\r\nto this most difficult part of the art, a patience in finishing what\r\nhe had so correctly planned, he might justly have claimed the place\r\nwhich Vandyck, all things considered, so justly holds as the first of\r\nportrait-painters\" (_Sixth Discourse_).\r\n\r\n\r\n2529. THE LADY WITH THE FAN.\r\n\r\n  _Frans Hals_ (Dutch: 1580-1666). _See 1021._\r\n\r\n\r\n2530. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Cornelis Janssens_ (Dutch: 1594-1664). _See 1320._\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds has some interesting remarks on the technique of\r\nJanssens. \"There is a kind of finishing,\" he says, \"which may safely be\r\ncondemned, as it seems to counteract its own purpose; that is, when the\r\nartist, to avoid that hardness which proceeds from the outline cutting\r\nagainst the ground, softens and blends the colours to excess: this is\r\nwhat the ignorant call high finishing, but which tends to destroy the\r\nbrilliancy of colour, and the true effect of representation; which\r\nconsists very much in preserving the same proportion of sharpness and\r\nbluntness that is found in natural objects. This extreme softening,\r\ninstead of producing the effect of softness, gives the appearance of\r\nivory, or some other hard substance, highly polished. The portraits of\r\nCornelius Janssen appear to have this defect, and consequently want\r\nthat suppleness which is the characteristic of flesh; whereas, in the\r\nworks of Vandyck, we find that true mixture of softness and hardness\r\nperfectly observed\" (_Eleventh Discourse_).\r\n\r\n\r\n2531.

The year of his death is not known;\r\n      1660 is the date of the last mention of him in extant\r\n      documents. A deed of 1645 records that the painter bound\r\n      himself, at a yearly fee of 1200 gulden, to work exclusively\r\n      for a certain picture-dealer, from 7 a.m. till dusk, daily,\r\n      Sundays and Festivals alone excepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n2552.

It will be noticed that the point of view is\r\nmuch the same, and that the effect of sunlight in the middle distance\r\nis the same, as in the large picture, No. 990. One may ask the question\r\nwhich Fromentin puts of a like instance: \"The two landscapes are,\r\nthe one on a large scale, the other on a small, a repetition of the\r\nsame subject. Is the little canvas the study which served as text for\r\nthe large? Did Ruysdael design, or did he paint from nature? Was he\r\ninspired, or did he copy directly? That is his secret. In any case the\r\ntwo works are charming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2562. COUNTRY SCENE, WITH RUINED CASTLE.\r\n\r\n  _Ruysdael_ (Dutch: 1628-1682). _See 627._\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best known of Ruysdael's small pictures, much prized\r\nfor its luminous quality: its pedigree has been traced through famous\r\ncollections for over 100 years. In the Bredel sale (1875) it fetched\r\n£2310; in the Dudley sale (1892), £1470. It is No. 786 in vol. iv.\r\n(1912) of Smith's _Catalogue Raisonné_.\r\n\r\n\r\n2563.

Her clavichord stands\r\nupon a marble table and is open, showing a landscape painted inside the\r\ncover; a viol da gamba and bow are in the left-hand bottom corner, and\r\na blue and yellow curtain above; a picture with three figures hangs on\r\nthe wall behind. Signed to the right of the lady's head, J V Meer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2569. THREE BOORS DRINKING.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian Brouwer_ (Dutch-Flemish: 1605-1638).\r\n\r\n      Brouwer, Flemish by birth, Dutch by adoption, rivalled his\r\n      contemporary, the younger Teniers, as a genre painter. His\r\n      realism is as humorous as it is vigorous. His pictures, says\r\n      M. Havard, \"are marvels of arrangement and colouring. They\r\n      are sober in conception, and exhibit exquisite modelling,\r\n      remarkable softness, and light and shade full of transparency\r\n      and truthfulness; qualities which, during his lifetime,\r\n      obtained for Brouwer the admiration of his brother-artists\r\n      and the enthusiasm of Rubens,\" who, as is known from extant\r\n      documents, possessed several of his pictures. His portrait was\r\n      painted by Van Dyck to be placed in a collection of the most\r\n      celebrated portrait-painters.\r\n\r\n      Brouwer led an exciting life, and has been the subject of\r\n      several biographies, which have alternately covered him with\r\n      scandal and whitewashed him. Documents unearthed during recent\r\n      years support the earlier accounts, which represent this\r\n      painter of topers as a jovial, reckless, dissipated Bohemian;\r\n      though his epitaph may yet have partly told truth in describing\r\n      him as \"a man of great mind, who rejected every splendour of\r\n      the world, and who despised gain and riches.\" The documents\r\n      are set out by Wurzbach (_Niederländisches Künstler-Lexicon_,\r\n      1906). Taking all the evidence together, we may picture Brouwer\r\n      as a genial fellow, fond of adventure, slow in setting to\r\n      work, quick in spending, inclined to libertinism and drink,\r\n      constantly running into debt, a sworn foe of shams and parade,\r\n      fond of his joke, a lover of poetry, and popular among all who\r\n      knew him. One of the stories told of him well illustrates\r\n      his mocking contempt of fashionable vanities. At Amsterdam\r\n      he had bought himself some coarse linen, which he had made\r\n      up into a fashionable suit and then painted with a flowered\r\n      pattern. Brouwer's costume became the talk of the town, and\r\n      shops were ransacked to furnish copies of it; till one night\r\n      at the theatre, the artist jumped on to the stage, wiped off\r\n      his pattern with a wet cloth, and laughed at his audience.\r\n      He was born at Oudenarde, ran away from home, had exciting\r\n      adventures on the way, and turned up in Amsterdam and Haarlem.\r\n      He is said to have entered the studio of Frans Hals, and to\r\n      have been very badly treated there. He is known to have been an\r\n      artist of repute, moving also in literary circles, in Amsterdam\r\n      and Haarlem, 1625-27. He is next heard of at Antwerp, where\r\n      in 1631-32 he was admitted into the Painters' Guild. Three\r\n      years later he became a member of the section of the Guild\r\n      for exercising rhetoric. He was cast into the state prison,\r\n      probably on suspicion of espionage; and during the seven months\r\n      of his incarceration, succeeded in running up new debts to\r\n      the extent of £400--a feat which may be explained by the fact\r\n      that the prison amenities included an excellent wine-tavern.\r\n      He died--of his dissipations, according to some, but quite\r\n      as probably of the plague--and was buried in the cemetery,\r\n      and afterwards in the Convent Church of the Carmelites. His\r\n      pictures are rare. The Wallace Collection, the Victoria and\r\n      Albert Museum (Ionides Collection), and the Dulwich Gallery\r\n      have each one good example. It has been suggested that the\r\n      Landscape, No. 72 in our Gallery, hitherto attributed to\r\n      Rembrandt, is by Brouwer.\r\n\r\n\r\n2570, 2571. WOODY LANDSCAPES.\r\n\r\n  _Hobbema_ (Dutch: 1638-1709). _See 685._\r\n\r\n\r\n2572. THE LITTLE FARM.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian van de Velde_ (Dutch: 1636-1672). _See 867._\r\n\r\nNo. 57 in the Exhibition of Dutch Masters at the Burlington Fine Arts\r\nClub, 1900, when it was thus described: \"In the centre, among sparse\r\ntrees in leaf, stands a small farm; to left a man accompanied by a\r\nwoman on horseback, driving a flock of sheep to pasture; in the left\r\nforeground a pool of water, with a cow drinking; in the centre, two\r\nherdsmen, with cows, sheep, and goats lying down and feeding. Cool\r\ndaylight with light clouds spreading over blue sky.\" Signed in the\r\ncentre \"A. v. Velde 1663.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2573. SEA-SCAPE: WINDY DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n2574.

A MUSICAL PARTY.\r\n\r\n  _Anthonie Palamedes_ (Dutch: 1601-1673).\r\n\r\n      Palamedes was the son of a gem-engraver at Delft. He became\r\n      Dean of the Painters' Guild. He painted portraits and small\r\n      \"conversation pieces,\" and sometimes supplied figures for the\r\n      architectural pictures of his friend Dirk van Delen (see 1010).\r\n      \"The light and spirited pose of his figures, his bold touch,\r\n      and the skill with which he makes the outline of his little\r\n      groups stand out, please the eye\" (Havard).\r\n\r\n\r\n2576. A FAMILY GROUP.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Codde_ (Dutch: 1599-1678).\r\n\r\n      A painter of Amsterdam much influenced by Frans Hals.\r\n\r\n\r\n2577. A STIFF BREEZE.\r\n\r\n\r\n2578.

VAN LEEUWENHOEK, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Maes_ (Dutch: 1632-1693). _See 153._\r\n\r\nA portrait of the eminent Dutch _savant_ (1632-1723) who has been\r\ncalled \"the father of scientific microscopy.\" He was elected a Fellow\r\nof the Royal Society in 1680.\r\n\r\n\r\n2582. FRUIT AND FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n  _David de Heem_ (Dutch: 1570-1632).\r\n\r\n      David de Heem, the elder, born at Utrecht, was the father of\r\n      the more celebrated still-life painter of the same name. He and\r\n      his son were the founders of the \"still-life\" school in their\r\n      country.\r\n\r\nExcept for the snail, this brightly-coloured arrangement of oysters, a\r\nlemon, a plum, cherries and nuts, with a glass of wine, is not unlike\r\nthe kind of arrangement of actual eatables and drinkables which one\r\nmay see to-day in the shop-windows of Italian restaurants in London.\r\nNor, in all probability, was the motive of the picture different. \"The\r\npainting of still-life in Holland,\" says M. Havard, \"was originally\r\nsign-painting. Inn-keepers and game-dealers had real pictures as signs,\r\npainted upon their shop-fronts, and we know of several of these simple\r\nmasterpieces which have found their way into important collections\"\r\n(_The Dutch School_, p. 260).\r\n\r\n\r\n2583. CATTLE IN A STORMY LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Paul Potter_ (Dutch: 1625-1654). _See 849._\r\n\r\nSigned, and dated 1647; formerly in the collection of Mr. Hope, of\r\nDeepdene.\r\n\r\n\r\n2584. A LADY HOLDING A MIRROR.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Codde_ (Dutch: 1579-1678). _See 2576._\r\n\r\n\r\n2585. ST. MARY MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Adrian Ysenbrandt_ (Flemish: died 1551).\r\n\r\n      Ysenbrandt was an assistant of Gerard David (see 1045). He\r\n      came to Bruges, and was admitted into the Painters' Guild in\r\n      1510; he worked there till his death. He acquired a reputation\r\n      for skill in painting the nude and the human countenance;\r\n      his carefulness of execution and the sweetness of expression\r\n      which he gave to his faces were much admired. Many of his\r\n      pictures were sent to Spain (see W. H. Weale in the _Burlington\r\n      Magazine_, vol. ii.).\r\n\r\nThis picture of the Magdalen, before whom an angel holds a crucifix,\r\nwas in the Exhibition of the Primitives at Bruges in 1902. The artist's\r\ncareful execution may be noted in the beautifully illuminated MS.\r\n\r\n\r\n2586. COAST SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\n2587. A CALM.\r\n\r\n\r\n2588.

PORTRAIT OF A MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Petrus Cristus_ (Flemish: about 1410-1472).\r\n\r\n      Cristus was born at Baerle, near Ghent. He purchased the right\r\n      of citizenship at Bruges in 1444--that is, four years after the\r\n      death of Jan van Eyck. He cannot therefore have been a pupil\r\n      of that master, as has often been surmised; but he belongs to\r\n      the school of the Van Eycks \"by his realistic style, by the\r\n      extreme care he bestowed on details, by his bold and powerful\r\n      colouring, and by the tasteful arrangement of his draperies\r\n      and interiors. But his works can never be mistaken for those\r\n      of Van Eyck; his outline is often harsh, his types are wanting\r\n      in character; his figures, designed and executed with very\r\n      inferior skill, are not painted in the same impressive manner\r\n      as those of the great master\" (Wauters). The portrait of a\r\n      Venetian consul (No. 696) is ascribed to him.\r\n\r\nAcquired by Mr. Salting from the Earl of Northbrook's collection;\r\nNo. 10 at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1892--remarkable for the\r\npreciseness and microscopic minuteness of hand displayed in it. The\r\nportrait of a devout and studious young man. He holds an open book;\r\nand on the wall of his chamber there is hung a board on which an\r\nilluminated sheet of vellum, edged with a narrow red riband, has been\r\nnailed. The miniature at the top of it represents the _Vernacle_ (our\r\nLord's head with cruciform nimbus and rays); and below is a rhymed\r\nprayer, headed _Incipit oratio ad sanctam Veronicam_, and continuing\r\n\"Salve sancta facies Nostri redemptoris,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n2594. THE DUKE OF CLEVES.\r\n\r\n  _Hans Memlinc_ (Early Flemish: 1430-1494). _See 686._\r\n\r\n\r\n2595. VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Dierick Bouts_ (Early Flemish: about 1410-1475).\r\n\r\n      Dirk Bouts, Thieiri Bouts, Dierick of Haarlem, or Thieiri\r\n      Stuerbout (by all of which names he has been called) was Dutch\r\n      by birth, being born at Haarlem. At some unknown date he\r\n      migrated to Flanders, and established himself at Louvain, where\r\n      he was appointed Painter to the Town. In 1468 he delivered\r\n      to the Council two beautiful pictures (now in the Museum of\r\n      Brussels) representing \"The Judgment of the Emperor Otho.\" His\r\n      colouring, says M. Havard, \"is clear and brilliant. Red and\r\n      green assume under his brush the brilliancy of the ruby and the\r\n      emerald. His draperies are of unusual softness, and have none\r\n      of that stiffness of fold which is peculiar to Jan van Eyck and\r\n      some of his pupils. His flesh tints are of a warm and vivid\r\n      tone, and his shadows are remarkably transparent. But his merit\r\n      is manifested especially in his picturesque and original manner\r\n      of arranging his compositions. He is besides remarkable for the\r\n      care and distinctness with which he treats the landscapes in\r\n      the background of his pictures.\" Little is known of his life,\r\n      and the ascription of various works to him is conjectural. To\r\n      him, in the latest revision of labels in our Gallery, are now\r\n      attributed Nos. 664, 774, and 943.\r\n\r\n\r\n2596. ST. JEROME.\r\n\r\n  _Gerard David_ (Early Flemish: 1460-1523). _See 1045._\r\n\r\n\r\n2597. THREE VENETIAN GENTLEMEN AND A CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Johannes Stephen Calcar_ (Venetian: 1499-1546).\r\n\r\n      \"In the year 1545 I became known to,\" says Vasari, \"and\r\n      contracted much friendship with Giovanni Calcar, a Flemish\r\n      painter of great merit, who so successfully practised the\r\n      Italian manner that his works were not always perceived to be\r\n      those of a Fleming; but he died at Naples while still young,\r\n      and when the fairest hopes had been conceived respecting his\r\n      future progress.\" He worked first at Dordrecht; but in 1536\r\n      went to Venice, where he entered Titian's studio. He became a\r\n      good master, says Vasari elsewhere, \"whether for large or small\r\n      figures, and in portraits was most admirable. By his hand--and\r\n      they must do him honour to all time--were the designs for\r\n      anatomical studies which the most admirable Andrea Vessalio\r\n      caused to be engraved on copper and published with his works\"\r\n      (vol. v. p. 403).\r\n\r\n\r\n2598.

VIRGIN AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (School of Cologne: early 16th Century).\r\n\r\nBy the master of the \"Death of the Virgin\" (a picture in the Munich\r\nGallery), a painter of Cologne, the teacher, it is said, of Bruyn. The\r\ndonor of the picture, with spectacles and a large straw hat, stands\r\nat a desk, reading. (The curious in such matters may consult _Notes\r\nand Queries_, 1890, for other early instances of spectacles in art.)\r\nThe picture was No. 48 (Plate 23) in the Burlington Fine Art Club's\r\nExhibition of Early Netherlandish Pictures, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n2604. PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n  _Christopher Amberger_ (German: 1490-1563).\r\n\r\n      This painter, who worked at Augsburg, probably studied under\r\n      Hans Burgkmair, and the painting of Hans Holbein the younger\r\n      had an evident effect on his style, so much so that his works\r\n      have been sometimes mistaken for those of Holbein. In 1532 he\r\n      painted the portrait of Charles V.; and Sandrart tells us that\r\n      this portrait was considered by the Emperor equal to any of the\r\n      pictures painted of him by Titian. He certainly honoured the\r\n      artist by giving him a gold chain and medal on the occasion\r\n      (Bryan's _Dictionary of Painters_).\r\n\r\n\r\n2605. DR. FUCHSIUS.\r\n\r\n  _Bartolomaus Bruyn_ (School of Cologne: died 1556).\r\n\r\n      This artist painted both religious subjects and portraits.\r\n      His earlier works in the former kind recall the style of \"The\r\n      Master of the 'Death of the Virgin'\" (see above, 2603). Bruyn\r\n      was the last really eminent painter of the Cologne School. He\r\n      was a municipal councillor of that town in 1550 and 1553.\r\n\r\nA portrait of the celebrated German physician, Leonhard Fuchs\r\n(1501-1566), one of the fathers of scientific botany. He has obtained,\r\nsays Hallam, a verdant immortality in the familiar flower which bears\r\nhis name, the fuchsia. He espoused the doctrines of the Reformation; in\r\nour portrait he holds a paper inscribed (in German) \"The word of the\r\nLord endureth for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2606. THE MADONNA ENTHRONED.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish: 16th Century).\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the triptych, the Virgin sits on a throne of Flemish\r\nrenaissance design. On the right, St. Ambrose; on the left, St. Louis\r\nof Toulouse. The royal rank of the latter Saint (nephew of St. Louis,\r\nKing of France, and son of Charles of Anjou, King of Naples), who\r\nrenounced his succession and became Bishop of Toulouse, is commonly\r\nindicated as here, by fleur-de-lys upon a blue ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n2607. A MAN WITH A MEDALLION.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish: 15-16th Century).\r\n\r\n\r\n2608. VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Robert Campin_ (Early Flemish: died 1444).\r\n\r\n      Campin, a native of Hainault, settled at Tournai in about\r\n      the year 1406, and quickly made a reputation, becoming\r\n      painter-in-ordinary to the town. Between 1423 and 1428 there\r\n      are records showing that he filled several offices in the\r\n      Painters' Guild and amassed a considerable fortune. He had\r\n      several apprentices; among them, Roger Van der Weyden (see\r\n      711), who was with him from 1426 to 1432. He made many designs\r\n      for tapestry and seems to have been charged with the designing\r\n      of all municipal art work in whatever kind (W. H. Weale, in the\r\n      _Burlington Magazine_, vol. xi.).\r\n\r\n\r\n2609. VIRGIN AND CHILD IN AN APARTMENT.\r\n\r\n  _Campin_ (Early Flemish: died 1444).\r\n\r\nThe Virgin is of the same unlovely type as in the picture ascribed to\r\nBouts, No. 2595. Behind her head is a screen of plaited straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n2610. ANTOINE DE BOURBON.\r\n\r\n  _Corneille de Lyons_ (French: 16th Century).\r\n\r\n      Two painters are catalogued under this name, father and son,\r\n      who are sometimes distinguished as \"Corneille le Grand\" and\r\n      \"Corneille le Petit.\" The elder was a Flemish painter, who\r\n      became naturalised in France in 1547. In 1540 he was appointed\r\n      Painter to the Dauphin; in 1551, Painter to the King. He is\r\n      mentioned in a poem of 1544, and in a deed of 1564. Several\r\n      portraits in the Museum of Versailles and at Chantilly are\r\n      ascribed to him. (See Henri Bouchot's _Les Clouet et Corneille\r\n      de Lyon_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n2611. A MAN IN BLACK.\r\n\r\n  _Corneille de Lyons_ (French: 16th Century).\r\n\r\n\r\n2612. LOUIS XI., KING OF FRANCE, 1423-1483.\r\n\r\n\r\n2613. PHILIP AND MARGARET OF BURGUNDY.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (French: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nThese pictures are of the early Burgundian School.\r\n\r\n\r\n2614. A LADY AS MARY MAGDALEN.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (French School: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nNotice the pearl embroidery.\r\n\r\n\r\n2615. MARY, QUEEN OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (French School: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nFormerly supposed to represent Mary Tudor, sister of Henry VIII., born\r\nin 1498.\r\n\r\n\r\n2616. PORTRAIT OF A LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\n2617. THE DUCHESS D'ANGOULÊME.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (French School: 15th Century).\r\n\r\n\r\n2618. VIRGIN AND CHILD WITH ANGELS.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (French School: 15th Century).\r\n\r\nPossibly by an artist of the Catalonian school.\r\n\r\n\r\n2619. LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _Nicolas Poussin_ (French: 1593-1665). _See 39._\r\n\r\n\r\n2620. THE HAPPY MOTHER.\r\n\r\n  _Jean Honoré Fragonard_ (French: 1732-1806).\r\n\r\n      The only poets who seized the spirit of the France of the\r\n      eighteenth century were, said the brothers Goncourt, two\r\n      painters: Watteau and Fragonard. It was Fragonard, says Sir\r\n      Claude Phillips, \"whose frank passion, whose irresistible\r\n      _élan_ lighted up the decline of the century much as the\r\n      imaginativeness of Watteau, his reticence and wistful charm\r\n      even in the midst of voluptuousness, lighted up its first\r\n      years. He is the Ovid of French painting.\" He was born at\r\n      Grasse near Cannes; and the pupil, in Paris, first of Chardin\r\n      and then of Boucher (see 1258, 1090). Having won the Prix de\r\n      Rome in 1752, he travelled in Italy, drawing all the sights and\r\n      monuments, and studying the old masters. The works of Tiepolo\r\n      (see 1192) especially attracted him, and something of their\r\n      brilliant, flashing _bravura_ was to be characteristic of\r\n      Fragonard himself. Soon after his return to Paris, a picture\r\n      of \"Coresus and Callirhoë\" made a sensation in the Salon, and\r\n      inspired what Lord Morley calls \"an elaborate but not very\r\n      felicitous criticism\" by Diderot. Fragonard did not return,\r\n      however, to compositions in the classical style; he found\r\n      his _métier_, and a highly lucrative practice, in pictures\r\n      of sentimental _genre_, audaciously amorous in subject, and\r\n      of masterly grace and lightness in execution. Some of his\r\n      most famous works in this sort are to be seen in the Wallace\r\n      Collection. The beautifully decorative canvases, the \"Roman\r\n      d'Amour de la Jeunesse,\" which were exhibited in London in\r\n      1898 and are now in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection, were a\r\n      commission from Madame du Barry, who, however, for reasons\r\n      which have not been clearly explained, declined them. From\r\n      Mademoiselle Guimard, the dancer, and queen of the _monde\r\n      galant_, Fragonard had received a like commission; and the\r\n      story is well known of the revenge taken by the painter when\r\n      he threw up the task, and transformed his portrait of the lady\r\n      as Terpsichore into Tisiphone. In 1794 Fragonard retired for\r\n      security from the Terror to Grasse, and on his return to Paris\r\n      he found his vogue gone. The Revolution had killed the taste\r\n      for his amorous trifles. The reign of the Classical School of\r\n      David had begun; and Fragonard died in comparative oblivion and\r\n      poverty.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 Fragonard had married Marie Anne Gérard, the miniature painter;\r\nand to the succeeding years belong, says his biographer (the Baron de\r\nPortalis), many pictures of which the theme is the cradle. Our picture\r\nis of that kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n2621. WILLOWS.\r\n\r\n  _Charles François Daubigny_ (French: 1817-1878).\r\n\r\n      Daubigny was the youngest member of the \"Barbizon\" group;\r\n      and, though he has artistic affinity with them, and regarded\r\n      Corot as his master, he painted not in their chosen district,\r\n      but on the banks of the Oise. His landscapes have not the\r\n      poetry of Corot's, nor the force of Rousseau's; but they\r\n      are more comfortable, as it were, and human. Corot's world\r\n      might be inhabited by dryads; in Rousseau's landscapes man\r\n      is subordinate or overpowered; Daubigny paints nature as the\r\n      pleasant abode of human beings fond of the country--commons\r\n      not too remote from a garden wall, the banks of pleasant\r\n      streams where men may boat or fish. The country with him is\r\n      full of fresh air. \"There is a story told of a poor young\r\n      man, afflicted with consumption, who coming suddenly before a\r\n      work of Daubigny, exclaimed, 'Ah, I can breathe better now'\"\r\n      (Thomson's _Barbizon School_, p. 283).\r\n\r\n      Daubigny's life is in accord with what have been suggested\r\n      above as characteristic notes of his art. He had no privations,\r\n      storms, or struggles. He was born at Paris, in an artistic\r\n      family; and as a youth assisted his father in painting boxes,\r\n      clock-cases and the like. He was a delicate child, and had\r\n      lived much with his nurse Bazot at Valmondois on the Oise,\r\n      where too he afterwards spent many holidays and where in later\r\n      years he made his home. At the age of 18 he went to Italy,\r\n      where the pictures of Claude especially attracted him. On his\r\n      return he was engaged for a time as a picture-restorer. He\r\n      studied with Paul Delaroche, but struck out a line for himself\r\n      in landscape pictures and etchings, and his works gradually\r\n      found favour. He had a boat made for voyaging on the Oise and\r\n      Seine, and this served as a floating studio. He built himself a\r\n      house at Auvers on the Oise, which was decorated with paintings\r\n      by Corot and other artist-friends. In 1866 he was invited by\r\n      Leighton and others to visit England, and he exhibited at the\r\n      Academy. In 1859 he had been made a Chevalier of the Legion of\r\n      Honour, and in 1874 he was promoted to the grade of Officer.\r\n      On his death-bed he said to those about him \"Adieu; I am going\r\n      to see above if friend Corot has found me any _motifs_ for\r\n      landscapes.\"\r\n\r\nSunset effect on a lake; with brilliant colours piercing through the\r\ntrees to the water. Signed, and dated 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n2622. THE BANKS OF A RIVER.\r\n\r\n  _Daubigny_ (French: 1817-1878). _See 2621._\r\n\r\nAn earlier picture (signed, and dated 1859). The small house-boat or\r\nbarge in the foreground may be the painter's floating studio, mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n2623. ALDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n2624. THE GARDEN WALL.\r\n\r\n  _Daubigny_ (French: 1817-1878). _See 2621._\r\n\r\n\r\n2625. THE BENT TREE.\r\n\r\n  _J. B. C. Corot_ (French: 1796-1875). _See 2135._\r\n\r\nThis beautiful picture was formerly in the collection of the late Mr.\r\nAlexander Young, one of the earliest purchasers of Corots in England,\r\nand was generally considered the gem of his collection of works by\r\nthat master. The writer of an account of the Young Collection calls\r\nattention, in describing this picture, to \"the wonderful gradation of\r\ntones in the trees and foreground, the subtle beauty of the distant\r\nview, the massing and treatment of the trees against the luminous sky,\r\nthe dignified restraint of the colour scheme\" (_Studio_, vol. 39).\r\n\r\n\r\n2626. THE WOOD GATHERER.\r\n\r\n  _Corot_ (French: 1796-1875). _See 2135._\r\n\r\nAlso from the Young Collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n2627. EVENING ON THE LAKE.\r\n\r\n  _Corot_ (French: 1796-1875). _See 2135._\r\n\r\nFormerly in the collection of Lord Leighton. That Corot liked the\r\neffect of trees stretching out a graceful arm across the water may be\r\nseen by comparing this picture with No. 2625.\r\n\r\n\r\n2628. NOON.\r\n\r\n\r\n2629. A FLOOD.\r\n\r\n  _Corot_ (French: 1796-1875). _See 2135._\r\n\r\n\r\n2630. COWS STANDING IN A MARSH.\r\n\r\n  _Corot_ (French: 1796-1875). _See 2135._\r\n\r\nHow simple are the ingredients out of which Corot makes a picture! A\r\nmarsh, two cows with a herdsman, and four willows; but all are suffused\r\nin a beautiful haze, and wrought into an exquisite harmony of tone and\r\ncolour. Like all Corot's pictures, this should be seen from some little\r\ndistance; the more it is observed, the more will its charm be felt.\r\n\r\n\r\n2631. THE FISHERMAN'S HUT.\r\n\r\n  _Corot_ (French: 1796-1875). _See 2135._\r\n\r\nAn exquisite harmony in tender green and pink.\r\n\r\n\r\n2632. THE STORM.\r\n\r\n\r\n2633. COMMON WITH STORMY SUNSET.\r\n\r\n  _Diaz_ (French: 1809-1876). _See 2058._\r\n\r\n\r\n2634. RIVER SCENE.\r\n\r\n  _Jules Dupré_ (French: 1812-1889).\r\n\r\n      Dupré, the last of the romantic school of French landscape, the\r\n      friend and the survivor by many years of Millet and Rousseau,\r\n      was born at Nantes. He began by painting on china, in the\r\n      studio at Sèvres of his uncle, Arsène Gillet, to whom also Diaz\r\n      was at one time apprenticed. At the age of 22 he was already\r\n      exhibiting at the Salon; and unlike other members of the group,\r\n      he was well treated by the artistic powers of the day. During a\r\n      visit to England he became acquainted with Constable. He lived\r\n      at Isle-Adam near Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n2635. SUNSET AT AUVERGNE.\r\n\r\n  _Théodore Rousseau_ (French: 1812-1867). _See 2439._\r\n\r\n\r\n2636. THE WHISPER.\r\n\r\n  _Jean François Millet_ (French: 1814-1875).\r\n\r\n      Millet, the peasant painter of France, occupies an important\r\n      place in the history of modern art. He heard, as he said, _le\r\n      cri de la terre_; and it is this to which he gave expression\r\n      in painting. Gambetta well described the characteristics\r\n      of Millet and his great contemporary. Rousseau (see 2439)\r\n      \"revealed the forest; Millet was the painter of the seasons,\r\n      the fields, and the peasants.\" Rousseau and others of the\r\n      school were painters of the country, of work-a-day nature;\r\n      Millet painted the country-labourers. He did not idealise them,\r\n      but he showed, with deep poetry, the dignity of their labour.\r\n      This is the spirit of the great pictures--\"The Sower,\" \"The\r\n      Gleaners,\" \"The Angelus,\" by which through engravings and other\r\n      reproductions he is most widely known. The depth of impression\r\n      which those works are found to make was the result of intense\r\n      feeling and infinite pains on the part of the artist. \"The\r\n      Angelus\" hung on the point of finish for many months. \"I mean,\"\r\n      he said, \"I mean the bells to be heard sounding, and only\r\n      natural truth of expression can produce the effect.\" When a\r\n      visitor wanted to buy \"The Sheepfold,\" Millet would not let it\r\n      go. \"It is not complete,\" he said; \"you cannot hear the dog\r\n      bark in there yet.\" The life and character of Millet were in\r\n      accord with his work. He was born of peasant ancestry, and the\r\n      boy grew up, as Mr. Henley says, \"in an environment of toil,\r\n      sincerity, and devoutness. He was fostered upon the Bible and\r\n      the great book of nature.\" \"Wake up, my little François,\" was\r\n      his grandmother's morning salutation, \"the birds have long\r\n      been singing the glory of God.\" He learned Latin from the\r\n      parish priest, and he soon became a student of Virgil. He\r\n      followed his father out into the fields, and thenceforward,\r\n      as became the eldest boy in a large family, worked hard at\r\n      grafting and ploughing, sowing and reaping, scything and\r\n      sheaving and planting, and all the many duties of husbandmen.\r\n      The life he painted was the life he knew and had led. The\r\n      spirit in which he painted it was that of his own reverent, and\r\n      somewhat melancholy, temperament. In 1849 he moved from Paris\r\n      to Barbizon, on the borders of the Forest of Fontainebleau,\r\n      which henceforward was his home. \"If you could but see,\" he\r\n      wrote, \"how beautiful the forest is! It is so calm, with such\r\n      a terrible grandeur, that I feel myself really afraid in it.\"\r\n      \"The most joyful thing I know,\" he wrote in a letter of 1851,\r\n      \"is the peace, the silence that one enjoys in the woods or in\r\n      the tilled lands. One sees a poor, heavily laden creature with\r\n      a bundle of faggots advancing from a narrow path in the fields.\r\n      The manner in which this figure comes suddenly before one is a\r\n      momentary reminder of the fundamental condition of human life\r\n      and toil. On the tilled land around, one watches figures hoeing\r\n      and digging. One sees how this or that one rises and wipes away\r\n      the sweat with the back of his hand. 'In the sweat of thy face\r\n      shalt thou eat bread.' Is that merry, enlivening work, as some\r\n      people would like to persuade us? And yet it is here that I\r\n      find the true humanity, the great poetry.\"\r\n\r\n      Like most innovators, Millet had to create the taste by which\r\n      he was to be admired; and, though the tale of his struggles and\r\n      poverty is sometimes exaggerated, he had many discouragements\r\n      and times of difficulty. He was neither \"classical\" nor\r\n      \"romantic,\" and both of those schools of art looked askance at\r\n      him. He was born at Gruchy, near Cherbourg; and till the age of\r\n      18 lived the life of a peasant. As there were then other sons\r\n      to help on the farm, his father, who had long noticed the lad's\r\n      artistic talent, took him to Cherbourg, where he received some\r\n      instruction under Mouchel and Langlois successively, and where\r\n      the Town Council gave him assistance in pursuing his studies.\r\n      The death of his father recalled him for a while to the farm;\r\n      but in 1837, at the age of 23, he went to Paris and entered the\r\n      studio of Delaroche (see 1909). His studio-nickname was \"The\r\n      Man of the Woods.\" He tried to sell works in his own style, but\r\n      found no market for them, and had to take instead to painting\r\n      pastorals, etc., in the manner of Boucher and Watteau. He\r\n      married in 1841; his wife died in 1844, and in 1845 he married\r\n      again. For a time, he attained a certain vogue as a painter of\r\n      the nude, and a classical picture of OEdipus in the Salon\r\n      of 1847 attracted some attention. In 1849, as already said,\r\n      he settled at Barbizon, and it is from 1850 onwards that his\r\n      great works date. They did not sell, or they commanded very\r\n      small prices. One was bought by his devoted friend, Rousseau;\r\n      for \"The Angelus\" he received £100. Within 20 years of his\r\n      death, it fetched £22,120 at public auction. But the reputation\r\n      of Millet grew gradually in his lifetime, and in 1868 he was\r\n      made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He is buried beside\r\n      Rousseau at Chailly, near Barbizon.\r\n\r\nThis little \"pastoral,\" in which a girl reclines on a rock, while a\r\nnaked child whispers in her ear, belongs to the painter's earlier\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n2669. ST. CLEMENT AND DONOR.\r\n\r\n  _Le Mâitre de Jean Perréal_ (French: 15th century).\r\n\r\n      Attributed to the master of Jean Perréal (called Jean de Paris,\r\n      who lived about 1463-1529); painter to Louis XII.\r\n\r\nSt. Clement, in cope and mitre (as Bishop of Rome), rests his right\r\nhand on the shoulder of the Donor; and in his left hand carries an\r\nanchor (the emblem referring to the legend of the Saint having been\r\ncast into the sea bound to an anchor). Londoners are familiar with the\r\nemblem, as it surmounts the steeple of St. Clement Danes in the Strand.\r\n\r\n\r\n2670. LADY HOLDING A ROSARY.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Flemish: 16th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n2671. A PIETÀ.\r\n\r\n  _Francia_ (Bolognese: 1450-1517). _See 179._\r\n\r\n\r\n2672. A VENETIAN GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Alvise Vivarini_ (Venetian: painted 1461-1503). _See 1872._\r\n\r\nThis striking and powerful portrait is signed by the artist on the\r\nparapet. It was formerly in the Bonomi-Cereda Collection at Milan (see\r\nBerenson's _Lorenzo Lotto_, p. 107).\r\n\r\n\r\n2673. NARCISSUS.\r\n\r\n  _Beltraffio_ (Lombard: 1467-1516). _See 728._\r\n\r\nThis pretty little picture was shown at the Old Masters' Exhibition of\r\n1870, where Ruskin noted it as an example of the phase in Italian art\r\nin which \"pictorial perfectness and deliciousness\" were sought before\r\neverything else (_Works_, xix. 444-5). \"The same model reappears in the\r\nprofile portrait of a youth (also in the character of Narcissus) in the\r\nUffizi Gallery; again in a profile of San Sebastian in the Frizzoni\r\nCollection at Bergamo; and again in a profile drawing in the Louvre\"\r\n(No. 47_a_ at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, 1898).\r\n\r\n\r\n2709. MOTHER AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n\r\n2710. THE DRAWBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n  _Jacob Maris_ (Dutch: 1837-1899).\r\n\r\n      Two small pictures by one of the principal masters of the\r\n      modern Dutch School. Jacob Maris was born at The Hague. He\r\n      studied in Paris under Hebert, and exhibited at the Salon from\r\n      1862 to 1872, when he returned to The Hague. His figure-studies\r\n      show, says R. A. M. S., \"a perception of the rich but quiet\r\n      tissue of colour which wraps all Nature if you look at it\r\n      broadly enough.\" In landscape he and his brother Matthew are\r\n      the chief of modern Dutch painters.\r\n\r\n\r\n2711. WATERING HORSES.\r\n\r\n  _Anton Mauve_ (Dutch: 1838-1888).\r\n\r\n      Mauve, one of the favourite landscape-painters of the modern\r\n      Dutch School, was born at Zaandam, the son of a Baptist\r\n      minister. He studied art at Amsterdam; his pensive and peaceful\r\n      landscapes, often combined with horses and other animals,\r\n      rapidly became popular. \"His colour,\" wrote W. E. Henley,\r\n      \"is quite his own. To a right sense of nature and a mastery\r\n      of certain atmospheric effects, he unites a genuine strain\r\n      of poetry. His treatment of animals is at once judicious and\r\n      affectionate. He is careful to render them in relation to their\r\n      aerial surroundings; but he has recognised that they too are\r\n      creatures of character and sentiment, and he loves to paint\r\n      them in their relations to each other and to man. The sentiment\r\n      is never forced, the characterisation is never strained, the\r\n      drama is never exorbitant; the proportions in which they\r\n      are introduced are so nicely adjusted that the pictorial,\r\n      the purely artistic qualities of the work are undiminished\"\r\n      (Edinburgh Exhibition Catalogue, 1886).\r\n\r\nThis picture is a good example of the luminous skies in which Mauve\r\nexcelled. The sky shines, it has been said, even on a dull day (see an\r\nappreciation of Mauve by Frank Rutter in the _Studio_, vol. 42).\r\n\r\n\r\n2712. THE INTERIOR OF HAARLEM CHURCH.\r\n\r\n  _Johannes Bosboom_ (Dutch: 1817-1891).\r\n\r\n      A characteristic piece by a painter of architecture who\r\n      \"rendered very delicately the play of sunbeams in the interior\r\n      of picturesque churches, and warm effects of light in large\r\n      halls and dusky corners\" (Muther).\r\n\r\n\r\n2713. THE PHILOSOPHER.\r\n\r\n  _Joseph Israels_ (Dutch: 1824-1911).\r\n\r\n      Joseph Israels, the head of the modern Dutch School and a\r\n      painter of world-wide reputation, has been called \"The Dutch\r\n      Millet,\" and \"a modern Rembrandt\"; and the phrases serve to\r\n      indicate his characteristics, and his place in the development\r\n      of modern art. He essayed to do what Rembrandt had done\r\n      triumphantly two centuries before: to paint \"not accidents,\r\n      but life itself.\" He made in Dutch art the same departure that\r\n      Millet made in French: he turned from conventional themes and\r\n      motives to the life around him. Like Millet, Israels made a\r\n      false start in art. He went to Paris in 1845, entered the\r\n      École des Beaux-Arts, showing \"Achilles and Patroclus\" as his\r\n      probationary drawing, and on his return to Amsterdam in 1848\r\n      began to paint, as Delaroche had taught him, \"historical\"\r\n      scenes, Calabrian brigands, and other subjects in \"the grand\r\n      style.\" His health broke down, and he was ordered change of\r\n      scene. At Zandvoort, a small fishing village near Haarlem,\r\n      he found his Barbizon. \"He lodged with a ship's carpenter,\r\n      took part in all the usages of his house-mates, and began to\r\n      perceive amid these new surroundings that the events of the\r\n      present are capable of being painted, that the sorrows of the\r\n      poor are as deep as the tragical fate of ancient heroes, that\r\n      everyday life is as poetic as any historical subject, and that\r\n      nothing suggests richer moods of feeling than the interior of a\r\n      fishing-hut, bathed in tender light and harmonious in colour.\r\n      This residence of several months in a distant little village\r\n      led him to discover his calling, and determined his future\r\n      career\" (Muther). He was a devoted Jew, with a deep interest\r\n      in the life and character of those of his race who abound in\r\n      Holland. Among them, and among the Dutch toilers of the sea, he\r\n      found his vocation, in painting the tragedy, the pathos, or the\r\n      simple domestic joys of humble working folk. He did this with a\r\n      technical mastery and with rare insight. His power of pathetic\r\n      expression is remarkable; and over his work a spirit of soft\r\n      tenderness is suffused. Many, perhaps most, of his pictures\r\n      are sombre, but he had an eye for youth and hope, as well as\r\n      age and sorrow, and few artists have painted children with so\r\n      much sympathy. His method is broad and simple; his pictures\r\n      having unity of effect, and telling their own story with great\r\n      directness.\r\n\r\n      Joseph Israels was born at Gröningen, in the north of Holland,\r\n      and for a time was occupied in his father's business as a\r\n      money-changer, but he was encouraged to draw. In 1844 he went\r\n      to Amsterdam, and entered the studio of Jan Kruseman. Then, as\r\n      already related, came his student-years in Paris, and his false\r\n      start as an historical painter. In 1855 he was represented at\r\n      the Paris Exhibition by an historical picture of the Prince\r\n      of Orange. In 1857 he showed at the Salon \"Children by the\r\n      Sea\" and \"Evening on the Beach.\" This change of subject marks\r\n      the true start in an artistic career which was continuously\r\n      successful, and which was prolonged into extreme old age. In\r\n      1862 his picture of \"The Shipwrecked Mariner\" (see below,\r\n      2732) created a sensation at the International Exhibition in\r\n      London. In 1863 he married and settled down in a house midway\r\n      between The Hague and Scheveningen, facing the canal. \"Here the\r\n      boats with their loads of herrings pass slowly along, so that\r\n      the painter has only to look out of the front windows of his\r\n      house in order to see the very men and women, the boats and\r\n      towing-ropes, that figure in his canvases. His work is done\r\n      in a studio in his garden; here he has a glass house, in which\r\n      he paints his open-air figures, and has likewise fitted up a\r\n      corner of an old Dutch cottage, so that open-air scenes and\r\n      interiors may be as lifelike as it is possible for an artist to\r\n      render them. As you enter this studio, you perceive a little\r\n      old gentleman at work, dressed in a brown velvet coat. His hair\r\n      is silvery white, and his somewhat pale face is lit up with the\r\n      kindliest of smiles. He speaks five or six languages in the\r\n      pleasantest voice imaginable, and English is one of them.\"\r\n\r\n      Personally, Israels was one of the most breezy of men, full of\r\n      life and vigour, genial and accessible: \"as fresh in mind as a\r\n      youngster in his teens, as versatile as he is amiable, able and\r\n      always ready to talk on every conceivable subject of interest,\r\n      ever contributing some caustic and pointed comment, yet never\r\n      assuming the dictatorial and self-opinionated manner which\r\n      genius often considers itself privileged to adopt. His modesty,\r\n      his unfailing amiability to all, young and old, distinguished\r\n      and insignificant, have served to endear Joseph Israels to all\r\n      who come in contact with him. He does not care to talk much\r\n      about his own achievements, but he is less reticent about those\r\n      of his son Isaac, who, he declares, is a greater artist than\r\n      himself.\" These _personalia_ are quoted from notices which\r\n      appeared in connection with the artist's 75th birthday (in\r\n      the _Daily News_ and in _Israel_). He had still twelve years\r\n      of life; and \"his was the rare satisfaction of the man who,\r\n      beginning in advance of his time, creates his own public, and\r\n      sees it growing stronger, larger, and more devoted as he passes\r\n      from youth to middle life and thence to extreme old age. He\r\n      was not consciously the founder of a school, but he had many\r\n      close followers, and the modern Dutch painters, who are now so\r\n      fashionable, owe their fundamental ideas to him\" (_Times_, Aug.\r\n      15, 1911).\r\n\r\nThere are passages in Browning's _Grammarian's Funeral_ which will\r\nsuggest themselves to many readers as they study this picture of an\r\nold student writing by the light of a single candle. The picture\r\nmay be compared with an earlier Dutch one of a like subject--\"The\r\nPhilosopher,\" by Bega (1481).\r\n\r\n\r\n2714. GRANDFATHER'S BIRTHDAY.\r\n\r\n  _Isabey_ (French: 1804-1886).\r\n\r\n      Eugène Gabriel Isabey (by whom there are several pictures in\r\n      the Wallace Collection) was born in Paris, the son of the\r\n      celebrated miniature-painter, Jean-Baptiste Isabey. He first\r\n      appeared as a genre painter; and \"amid the group of Classicists\r\n      of his time, he had (says Dr. Muther) the effect of a beautiful\r\n      patch of colour.\" He afterwards took to sea painting, having\r\n      in 1830 accompanied the French expedition to Algiers as marine\r\n      draughtsman.\r\n\r\nA characteristic example of the elegant facility with which the painter\r\nrendered scenes involving gay attire.\r\n\r\n\r\n2715. FISH MARKET, DIEPPE.\r\n\r\n  _Isabey_ (French: 1804-1886).\r\n\r\n\r\n2723, 2724. LANDSCAPES.\r\n\r\n  Ascribed to _G. Poussin_ (French: 1613-1675). _See_ 31.\r\n\r\nThese landscapes, only recently included in the official numbering of\r\nthe collection, were presented by Mr. P. Pusey in 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n2725. CHRIST BLESSING.\r\n\r\n  _Benedetto Diana_ (Venetian: died 1525).\r\n\r\n      \"If Benedetto be the painter of the fine picture of 'Christ\r\n      at Emmaus,' in the church of St. Salvatore, Venice, still\r\n      attributed in the guidebooks to Giovanni Bellini, he must have\r\n      been an artist of no ordinary merit, and one who gradually,\r\n      from an unpromising commencement of his artistic career,\r\n      attained a high place among the followers of the master. A\r\n      half-length figure, larger than life, of the Saviour in the\r\n      act of blessing, signed with the painter's name, in private\r\n      possession at Venice, although in a very damaged condition, has\r\n      a grand and impressive character not unworthy of Bellini, to\r\n      whom, as to other Venetian masters of note, many works by Diana\r\n      in sundry collections are ascribed. He was employed with the\r\n      two Bellini and Alvise Vivarini in decorating the hall of the\r\n      Ducal Palace\" (Layard's ed. of Kugler, 1887, p. 333).\r\n\r\n\r\n2727. LE PONT DE LA TOURNELLE, PARIS.\r\n\r\n  _Stanislas Lapine_ (French: 1836-1892).\r\n\r\n      Born at Caen; studied under Corot; exhibited at the Salon from\r\n      1859.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Notre Dame in the middle distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n2731. LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _W. Buitenweg_ (Dutch: 1590-1630).\r\n\r\n      William Buitenweg, or Buytewech, best known for his landscape\r\n      drawings, was born at Rotterdam; married at Haarlem in 1613,\r\n      and in 1625 returned to Rotterdam.\r\n\r\n\r\n2732. THE SHIPWRECKED MARINER.\r\n\r\n  _Joseph Israels_ (Dutch: 1824-1911). _See 2713._\r\n\r\nThis celebrated picture--one by which the master often said he would\r\nlike to be judged--created a great sensation at the International\r\nExhibition of 1862. It was, said one critic, the most moving picture in\r\nthe exhibition; before it, said another, crowds daily linger. The storm\r\nhas passed, the waves have subsided, the greyish-black thunderclouds\r\nhave vanished, and greenish, pallid sky smiles upon the earth once\r\nmore. But upon the waves a shattered boat still rocks, and men and\r\nwomen and children have come down to see what victim may have been\r\ncast up by the tide--\"For men must work, and women must weep, Though\r\nstorms be sudden, and waters deep, And the harbour bar be moaning.\"\r\nTwo fishermen reverently bear home the body of their dead comrade. His\r\ndisconsolate wife and two awestruck children walk in front, and his\r\nold mother beside him. A man with a boat-hook, a woman pointing to the\r\nwreck on the reef, and others follow the procession, in the rear of\r\nwhich is the pathetic figure of a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n2757. TARTARUS: A SATIRICAL DESIGN.\r\n\r\n  _James Callot_ (French: 1593-1635).\r\n\r\n      \"A curious and fantastic composition (in Indian ink), by a\r\n      celebrated engraver and draughtsman, in which it would seem\r\n      that the artist intended to satirise the ecclesiastic factions\r\n      rife in France during the minority of Louis XIII. Under the\r\n      vault of a huge cave, round the upper part of which evil\r\n      spirits and harpies are sporting, several figures are grouped.\r\n      In the centre of the foreground two Jesuits are derided by\r\n      demons. On the right, Cerberus, chained to a rock, guards the\r\n      entrance to Hell, while an armed warrior (Louis XIII.) stands\r\n      near with his back to the spectator. On the left is Death,\r\n      surrounded by his victims and the Vices. In the middle distance\r\n      Charon is crossing the Styx with his boat full of passengers,\r\n      whom a crowd on the shore vainly endeavour to join. Beyond are\r\n      represented the tortures of the condemned, among whom Ixion,\r\n      Tityus, the Danaides, and other mythological personages are\r\n      conspicuous. The armorial bearings introduced on the lower\r\n      edge of the drawing are supposed to be those of M. de Boyer of\r\n      Baudot, who is said to have suggested the design\" (_Director's\r\n      Report_, 1884). The artist's independence of character is\r\n      recorded in a familiar anecdote. He was witness to the siege\r\n      and capitulation of his native town, Nancy, in 1633, and the\r\n      French king called on him to engrave a plate commemorative of\r\n      the occurrence. When he declined, some of the courtiers are\r\n      said to have remarked to the artist that there were means to\r\n      make him comply. He replied that he would sooner cut off his\r\n      right hand than employ it in such a work; a speech which, being\r\n      reported to the king, led him to say that the Dukes of Lorraine\r\n      were fortunate in the possession of such subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n2758. A SQUALL FROM THE WEST.\r\n\r\n  _Louis Eugène Boudin_ (French: 1825-1898). _See 2078._\r\n\r\n\r\n2759. STORMY LANDSCAPE.\r\n\r\n  _George Michel_ (French: 1763-1843). _See 2258._\r\n\r\n\r\n2764. A FAMILY GROUP.\r\n\r\n  Ascribed to _Jan Vermeer_ (Dutch: 1632-1675).\r\n\r\nThis picture once formed part of No. 1699; the right arm of the seated\r\nchild and the tablecloth here are continued there.\r\n\r\n\r\n2767. THE SEA.\r\n\r\n  _Gustave Courbet_ (French: 1819-1877).\r\n\r\n      Courbet is famous in the history of modern French painting as\r\n      the first of the \"realists\"; he is the Caravaggio of France,\r\n      full of force and vigour, but often somewhat coarse and brutal.\r\n      His landscapes and seapieces will probably be esteemed more\r\n      highly by posterity than his realistic works. He was, says Dr.\r\n      Muther, \"the first French painter of sea-pieces, who had a\r\n      feeling for the sombre majesty of the sea. His very quietude\r\n      is expressive of majesty; his peace is imposing, his smile\r\n      grave; and his caress is not without a menace.\" Courbet was\r\n      a revolutionary in politics, as in art. In September 1870 he\r\n      was appointed Director of the Fine Arts by the Provisional\r\n      Government, and he afterwards joined the Commune. He was\r\n      instrumental in saving many works of art, but he ordered the\r\n      destruction of the Column in the Place Vendôme. For this he was\r\n      brought before a court-martial and sentenced to six months'\r\n      imprisonment. Afterwards, in a civil action, he was cast in\r\n      heavy damages; his furniture and pictures were sold; and he\r\n      retired to Switzerland. He died at La Tour, Vevay, a ruined\r\n      man.\r\n\r\n\r\n2790. THE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Mabuse_ (Flemish: about 1470-1541). _See 656._\r\n\r\nThis famous picture was acquired for the National Gallery from\r\nRosalind, Countess of Carlisle, in 1911, for £42,776.[262] The picture\r\nwas painted in about the year 1500 for the Abbey of Grammont in East\r\nFlanders. In 1600 it was bought for 2000 florins by the Archduke\r\nAlbert to decorate the high altar of the Court Chapel in Brussels. A\r\nstory which is recorded of it in those days is a tribute to its bright\r\nattractiveness. During Lent it used to be concealed by the hanging in\r\nfront of it of a picture of the Crucifixion as less likely to interfere\r\nwith the penitential thoughts proper to the season. In the 18th century\r\nthe picture passed into the collection of Prince Charles of Lorraine,\r\nGovernor-General of the Netherlands, and thence into that of the\r\nfifth Earl of Carlisle. For more than a century it remained at Castle\r\nHoward, and many connoisseurs who saw it there wrote of it as one of\r\nthe chief art-treasures of Great Britain. \"I do not think,\" wrote W.\r\nBürger (Thoré), \"that there is anywhere else a picture by Mabuse so\r\nbrilliant, so well preserved, so _capital_ as the Adoration of the\r\nKings, belonging to the Earl of Carlisle.\" \"For variety of character,\r\nglow of colour, and finished execution, quite unsurpassed,\" said Mrs.\r\nJameson of it.\r\n\r\nThe pride of the artist himself in his work is shown by the fact that\r\nhe has signed his name upon it in two places--_i.e._ on the head-dress\r\nof Balthasar, the black king, and on the metal collar of his attendant.\r\nThe signature Jennin Gossart (diminutive, Little John), was that under\r\nwhich Mabuse was inscribed as a member of the Guild of St. Luke at\r\nAntwerp. In the history of Flemish art the picture is of interest as\r\none of the last works painted before the \"Italianising\" influence\r\nbecame marked. It is one of the finest specimens of Mabuse's first\r\nperiod (see under 656); but it will be noticed that the architecture of\r\nthe ruin is no longer Gothic, but already shows the influence of the\r\nRenaissance. The picture is after 400 years in perfect preservation.\r\nIt has an artistic unity, for the parts are subordinated to the\r\nwhole; but it is full of incident, which adds not a little to its\r\nattractiveness and curious interest.\r\n\r\nThe Adoration of the Magi affords a remarkable instance of the way\r\nin which the Bible text, first expounded by Church legends, was then\r\nembroidered by the painters; and this example of \"evolution in art\"\r\nmay be studied very fully in the National Gallery, which contains\r\npictures of the subject painted in various schools and at various\r\nperiods. The starting-point of the whole development is the second\r\nchapter of St. Matthew's Gospel where it is related that \"wise men came\r\nfrom the East to Jerusalem\"; that a star guided them to Bethlehem; and\r\nthat \"when they were come into the house, they saw the young child\r\nwith Mary his mother, and fell down and worshipped him; and when they\r\nhad opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts--gold, and\r\nfrankincense, and myrrh.\" Legend set itself to work on this narrative.\r\nThe Wise Men, it was decided, were three in number; and the Psalmist's\r\nprediction--\"the Kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring\r\npresents, the Kings of Sheba and Saba shall offer gifts\"--showed that\r\nthe Magi were kings. Later writers identified their realms as Tarsus,\r\nSaba, and Nubia; whence one of the kings is commonly represented as a\r\nMoor or Nubian. Their names also became known--Gaspar, Melchior, and\r\nBalthasar. Further developments of the legend--how their remains were\r\ndiscovered by the Empress Helena at Constantinople, and taken by Milan\r\nto Cologne--do not here concern us; it will be seen that by the time\r\nart was ready to take up the story, the painters had much material\r\naround which to let their fancy play.\r\n\r\nThe earlier painters in each school treated the story simply. Then as\r\ntechnical resources increased, and artistic effect rather than mere\r\nreligious instruction became the motive, the theme was ever more and\r\nmore expanded, until it became the most gorgeously rendered of all\r\nthe Gospel scenes. Many readers will remember the severe and simple\r\ntreatment of the subject by Giotto in the Arena Chapel at Padua;\r\nwith which may be compared in our gallery Orcagna's small picture\r\n(574). If the visitor after looking at that will turn to the splendid\r\npageant (1033), with its seventy figures, by Botticelli (or Filippino\r\nLippi), he will see at a glance how the theme became embroidered and\r\nenlarged. The picture by Fra Angelico (582) represents an intermediate\r\nstage. A similar contrast may be noted in the Flemish room. The\r\npicture attributed to David (1079) is simple, earnest, and homely;\r\nfar less gorgeous and various than the Mabuse. The fact is that, in\r\nthe more elaborate pictures of the subject, it was taken as an excuse\r\nor occasion for displaying whatever elements of pomp or circumstance\r\nappealed to the individual artist. Thus Peruzzi (167 and 218)\r\nelaborates the architecture and the horses, and introduces portraits.\r\nThe Tuscans made out of the subject a Florentine pageant. Mabuse's\r\npicture is interesting, amongst other reasons, as a kind of epitome\r\nof the arts and crafts of his time. Note, for instance, the cups and\r\nchalices in which the kings bring their presents; their jewelled robes\r\nand head-dresses; and, for a minor detail, the pretty bag worn by the\r\nBlack King's page: it might well be copied for a lady's reticule to-day.\r\n\r\nNo less remarkable than the variety of treatment in pictures of the\r\nMagi is the large measure of uniformity of type which may be found\r\nin them all. A few remarks on these common elements, which were for\r\nthe most part symbolic, will serve the double purpose of directing\r\nattention to further details in Mabuse's picture and of connecting it\r\nwith other examples in the Gallery. The _scene_ of the drama is in\r\nthe earliest pictures a stable or a shed; in the later, it is almost\r\ninvariably the ruins of a temple or other ancient building--a symbol of\r\nthe triumph of Christianity over paganism. The ox and the ass will be\r\nnoticed among the ruins here, and the shepherds are seen approaching.\r\nThe idea is to mark the event as a manifestation alike to the Jews\r\n(the shepherds) and to the Gentiles (the Magi). Angels hover above,\r\nsinging the \"Gloria in Excelsis,\" and the composition is crowned by\r\nthe Star with the Dove. The _background_ almost invariably includes a\r\nmountainous landscape, through which the retinue of the kings may be\r\ndiscerned winding its way--a reminder that they journeyed from a far\r\ncountry. This is a feature, indicated sufficiently by Mabuse, which\r\nmay be seen more emphasised in the picture by Foppa (729). The _Kings_\r\nare nearly always shown as old, middle-aged, and young respectively,\r\nand one of them is black: when the Gentiles were called to salvation,\r\nall ages, continents, and races were included. In Mabuse's picture the\r\nequality of the races is emphasised in a further way; the Black King,\r\nconspicuous on the left, has his train borne by a white page. The\r\neldest of the kings offers a vase of gold, out of which Christ has\r\ntaken a piece, which He holds in His hand. The king uncovers his head.\r\n\"To most mediæval painters the Adoration envisages itself essentially\r\nas an act of feudal homage.\" Conspicuous in the foreground are two\r\n_dogs_. \"The one on the right,\" says the Official Catalogue, \"is\r\nsimilar to a dog by Albert Dürer in his engraving of St. Eustace, that\r\non the left is reversed from a print by Martin Schongauer.\" The dog is\r\noften thus included in the \"Adoration\"; as, for instance, in one of\r\nthe earliest (Orcagna, 574) and in one of the latest (Peruzzi, 218) of\r\nour versions; and everybody will have noticed how frequently in other\r\nreligious pictures also the dog is introduced. \"This custom of putting\r\neither the dog, or some inferior animal, to be either in contrast, or\r\nmodest companionship, with the nobleness of human form and thought,\r\nis,\" says Ruskin, \"a piece of what may be called mental comparative\r\nanatomy, which has its beginning very far back in art\" (_Eagle's\r\nNest_, ch. 8; see also _Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. chs. 3, 6).\r\nThe place of _Joseph_ in the scene differs a good deal in different\r\npictures, for the early legends varied. Orcagna (574) shows him\r\nreceiving one of the presents from the hands of the Child: he plays, as\r\nit were, the part of royal treasurer or chamberlain. Dosso Dossi (640)\r\nshows him kneeling in the background. In the present picture he stands,\r\nin a red dress, under an archway, listening devoutly to the heavenly\r\nharmony. All the _figures_ in Mabuse's picture (there are some thirty)\r\nwill repay examination. The Virgin's expression is well given; and, as\r\na study in contrasts, the reverent figures behind the kneeling king may\r\nbe compared with the man on the extreme left who, catching hold of a\r\npillar, is leaning out in curiosity to see the sights. There is much\r\nother detail which might be described--the plants, for instance, in the\r\nforeground and on the ruins; but enough has been said to indicate the\r\nwealth and variety of interest which is to be found in this picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n2856. A CAVALIER AND A LADY.\r\n\r\n  _Pieter Quast_ (Dutch: 1606-1647).\r\n\r\n      Quast was a painter and engraver of The Hague; his pictures are\r\n      in the style of Brouwer and Isaac van Ostade.\r\n\r\n\r\n2862. ST. JOHN GUALBERTO.\r\n\r\n  _Lorenzo Monaco_ (Florentine: 1370-1425). _See 1897._\r\n\r\nThis picture represents St. John Gualberto, the Florentine (died 1073),\r\nestablishing the Order of the Vallombrosans, whose proper habit is of\r\na pale ash colour. He was Abbot of San Miniato, from which he retired\r\nto Vallombrosa, establishing there the Order called after the place of\r\nits original home.\r\n\r\n\r\n2863. VIRGIN AND CHILD, WITH ANGELS.\r\n\r\nSchool of _Benozzo Gozzoli_ (Florentine: 1420-1497). _See 283._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] It is worth noting that a similar incident (which in this picture\r\nhas greatly shocked some of the critics) is introduced in Orcagna's\r\ngreat fresco of the Triumph of Death. \"The three kings of the German\r\nlegend are represented looking at the three coffins containing\r\nthree bodies of kings, such as themselves, in the last stage of\r\ncorruption.... Orcagna disdains both poetry and taste; he wants the\r\n_facts_ only; he wishes to give the spectator the same lesson that\r\nthe kings had, and, therefore, instead of concealing the dead bodies,\r\nhe paints them with the most fearful detail. And then, he does not\r\nconsider what the three kings might most gracefully do. He considers\r\nonly what they actually, in all probability, _would have done_. He\r\nmakes them looking at the coffins with a startled stare, and one\r\nholding his nose\" (_Lectures on Architecture and Painting_, pp. 209,\r\n210).\r\n\r\nA comparison of the various opinions expressed on this picture would\r\nform a diverting chapter in the history of art criticism. Thus in\r\nKugler's _Handbook_ we are told that it is \"in many respects one of the\r\nnoblest pictures existing\"; Sir Henry Cole (\"Felix Summerly\") called\r\nit \"doubtless the greatest Italian painting in this country\"; Hazlitt\r\nsaid it was \"one of the best pictures on so large a scale that he\r\nwas acquainted with\"; Waagen pronounced it to be \"the most important\r\nspecimen of Italian art in England\"; Solly called it \"the second\r\npicture in the world\"; and Mrs. Jameson saw in it a combination of \"the\r\ncharacteristic power and beauty of the finest school of design and the\r\nfinest school of colouring in the world.\" For an equally uncompromising\r\ncondemnation see Landseer's _Catalogue_, pp. 92-119. It is interesting\r\nto note that in some cases the admiration excited by the picture was\r\ndue to the dirt with which by long neglect and lapse in time it had\r\ncome to be discoloured. Thus Hazlitt says that \"the figure of Lazarus\r\nis very fine and bold. The flesh is _well-baked_, _dingy_, and ready to\r\ncrumble from the touch, when it is liberated from its dread confinement\r\nto have life and motion impressed on it again\" (_Criticisms on Art_,\r\n1843, p. 9). Thus it was inferred that Sebastiano stooped to the\r\ntrivial artifice of imparting an appearance of half putrefaction to\r\nthe exhumed corpse. The absurdity of this criticism is well exposed by\r\nHenry Merritt, the famous picture restorer, in his essay on \"Dirt and\r\nPictures Separated\" (_Art Criticism and Romance_, i. 69). The fact is\r\nthat the whole picture was sadly darkened with time, and that it had\r\nbecome \"embedded beneath a thick covering, compounded of half opaque\r\nvarnish, patches of modern paint, and dirt.\" It has only been found\r\npossible partly to remove this covering. It may not be uninteresting to\r\nadd that the picture was a favourite with Charles Darwin. \"Many of the\r\npictures in the National Gallery,\" he wrote, \"gave me much pleasure;\r\nthat of Sebastian del Piombo exciting in me a sense of sublimity\"\r\n(_Life_, i. 49).\r\n\r\nThe poet Tennyson was another great admirer of the picture. His\r\nson, describing visits with the poet to the National Gallery, says,\r\n\"he always led the way first of all to the \"Raising of Lazarus,\" by\r\nSebastian del Piombo, and to Titian's \"Bacchus and Ariadne.\"\" \"The\r\nChrist I call Christlike,\" said Tennyson on one occasion to Carlyle,\r\n\"is Sebastian del Piombo's in the National Gallery\" (_Memoir_, ii.\r\n235). It is possible that the poet may have written the stanzas cited\r\nabove with his eye on Sebastiano's picture.\r\n\r\n[39] \"When they went to nature, which I believe to have been a very\r\nmuch rarer practice with them than their biographers would have us\r\nsuppose, they copied her like children, drawing what they knew to be\r\nthere, but not what they saw there\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii.\r\nsec. ii. ch. iii. § 7).\r\n\r\n[40] The \"Claude Lorraine glass\"--a convex dark, or coloured\r\nhand-mirror used to concentrate the features of a landscape in a\r\nsubdued tone--\"gives the objects of nature,\" says an old writer, \"a\r\nsoft mellow tinge like the colouring of that master.\"\r\n\r\n[41] But Ruskin does not quite keep his promise. \"If Claude had been a\r\ngreat man he would not have been so steadfastly set on painting effects\r\nof sun; he would have looked at all nature, and at all art, and would\r\nhave painted sun effects somewhat worse, and nature universally much\r\nbetter\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. xviii. § 23).\r\n\r\n[42] The passages quoted from Sir F. Burton are to be found in his\r\nedition of the Official Catalogue (unabridged) of the Foreign Schools.\r\nThat work, which occupied the late Director's leisure for many years,\r\nis a worthy monument of his wide learning and fastidious taste. A\r\nlarge-paper edition was issued by the Stationery Office in 1892.\r\n\r\n[43] See, however, the sunset picture of his predecessor, Bellini\r\n(726). Connoisseurs should note that this picture is referred to by\r\nRichter as bearing on the vexed question of Palma Vecchio's relation\r\nwith Titian, and showing that the latter imitated the former rather\r\nthan _vice versâ_ (_Italian Art in the National Gallery_, p. 85. See\r\nalso Morelli's _German Galleries_, p. 25).\r\n\r\n[44] Called also \"Sinon before Priam\" (_Æneid_, ii. 79).\r\n\r\n[45] The two pictures were bought by the nation in 1834 for £11,550.\r\nThe sum was then thought a very large one, and the trustees fortified\r\nthemselves with the opinion of experts. Amongst these Sir David Wilkie,\r\nR.A., wrote, \"It is certainly a large sum for two pictures; but giving\r\nthis difficulty its due weight, I would decidedly concur in giving this\r\nsum rather than let them go out of the country, considering the rarity\r\nof such specimens even in foreign countries, and their excellence as\r\nexamples of the high school to which they belong, to which it must be\r\nthe aim of every other school to approach.\"\r\n\r\n[46] The picture is inscribed \"Mariage d'Isaac avec Rebecca,\" but it is\r\na repetition with some variations in detail of the Claude known as _Il\r\nMolino_ (The Mill) in the Doria palace at Rome. Ruskin characterises\r\nthis version of the subject as a \"villainous and unpalliated copy.\"\r\n\"There is not,\" he adds, \"one touch or line of even decent painting in\r\nthe whole picture; but as connoisseurs have considered it a Claude, as\r\nit has been put in our Gallery for a Claude, and as people admire it\r\nevery day for a Claude, I may at least presume it has those qualities\r\nof Claude in it which are wont to excite the public admiration, though\r\nit possesses none of those which sometimes give him claim to it; and I\r\nhave so reasoned, and shall continue to reason upon it, especially with\r\nrespect to facts of form, which cannot have been much altered by the\r\ncopyist\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. iii. ch. i. § 9, sec.\r\niv. ch. ii. § 8).\r\n\r\n[47] The following is the text of this portion of Turner's will: \"I\r\ngive and bequeath unto the Trustees and Directors for the time being\r\nof a certain Society or Institution, called the 'National Gallery'\r\nor Society, the following pictures or paintings by myself, namely\r\nDido Building Carthage, and the picture formerly in the De Tabley\r\ncollection. To hold the said pictures or paintings unto the said\r\nTrustees and Directors of this said Society for the time being,\r\nin trust for the said Institution or Society for ever, subject,\r\nnevertheless, to, for, and upon the following reservations and\r\nrestrictions only; that is to say, I direct that the said pictures\r\nor paintings shall be hung, kept, and placed, that is to say, always\r\nbetween the two pictures painted by Claude, The Seaport and Mill.\"\r\nThe \"picture formerly in the De Tabley collection\" is the \"Sun rising\r\nin a Mist,\" 479. Turner bought it back at Lord de Tabley's sale at\r\nChristie's in 1827 for £514: 10s., and ever afterwards refused to part\r\nwith it. The other picture, the Carthage (498), was returned unsold\r\nfrom the Academy, and Turner always kept it in his gallery. His friend\r\nChantrey used to make him offers for it, but each time its price rose\r\nhigher. \"Why, what in the world, Turner, are you going to do with the\r\npicture?\" he asked. \"Be buried in it,\" Turner replied--a remark he\r\noften made to other friends.\r\n\r\n[48] \"So in N. Poussin's 'Phocion' (40) the shadow of the stick on the\r\nstone in the right-hand corner, is shaded off and lost, while you see\r\nthe stick plainly all the way. In nature's sunlight it would have been\r\nthe direct reverse: you would have seen the shadow black and sharp all\r\nthe way down; but you would have had to look for the stick, which in\r\nall probability would in several places have been confused with the\r\nstone behind it\" (_ibid._).\r\n\r\n[49] Compare on this point G. Poussin's \"Abraham and Isaac\" (31).\r\n\r\n[50] One may compare with Ruskin's description the similar one by\r\nTennyson of a distant view of Monte Rosa--\r\n\r\n    How faintly-flush'd, how phantom-fair,\r\n    Was Monte Rosa, hanging there\r\n      A thousand shadowy-pencill'd valleys\r\n    And snowy dells in a golden air.\r\n\r\n  _The Daisy._\r\n\r\n\r\n[51] \"In some of the convents (in Mexico) there still exist, buried\r\nalive like the inmates, various fine old paintings ... brought there by\r\nthe monks\" (Dublin National Gallery Catalogue). The Spanish influence\r\ngave birth, moreover, to a native Mexican School of painting, said to\r\nbe of considerable merit.\r\n\r\n[52] \"Murillo, of all true painters the narrowest, feeblest, and most\r\nsuperficial, for those reasons the most popular\" (_Two Paths_, § 57\r\n_n._)--\"The delight of vulgar painters (as Murillo) in coarse and\r\nslurred painting merely for the sake of its coarseness, opposed to the\r\ndivine finish which the greatest and mightiest of men disdained not\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. x. § 3).\r\n\r\n[53] The French partiality for Murillo is traditional, dating back to\r\nMarshal Soult's time, from whose collection the \"Immaculate Conception\"\r\nwas bought. Murillos were his favourite spoils from the Peninsular War.\r\n\"One day, showing General G---- his gallery in Paris, Soult stopped\r\nopposite a Murillo, and said, 'I very much value _that_, as it saved\r\nthe lives of two estimable persons.' An Aide-de-camp whispered, 'He\r\nthreatened to have both shot on the spot unless they _gave_ up the\r\npicture'\" (Ford's _Handbook_).\r\n\r\n[54] \"He was not a _bad_ painter,\" continued Ruskin, \"but he exercises\r\na most fatal influence on the English School, and therefore I owe\r\nhim an especial grudge. I have never entered the Dulwich Gallery for\r\nfourteen years without seeing at least three copyists before the\r\nMurillos. I _never_ have seen _one_ before the Paul Veronese....\r\nI intend some time in my life to have a general conflagration of\r\nMurillos.\" Ruskin would have been relieved to know that of late\r\nyears at the National Gallery Paul Veronese--and especially his St.\r\nHelena--has been very frequently copied.\r\n\r\n[55] Amongst the curiosities of criticisms are the differences\r\nbetween experts as to whether this is a morning or an evening effect.\r\nContradictory opinions on the point were submitted to the Select\r\nCommittee of 1853, but as the picture had been \"restored,\" each side\r\nwas able to impute the difficulty of deciding to the \"ruinous\" nature\r\nof that operation.\r\n\r\n[56] It may be interesting to note on the other side that Dr. Waagen\r\n(whose experience of the sea is given under No. 149) finds the waves in\r\nthis picture to \"run high,\" and to be \"extraordinarily deep and full.\"\r\n\r\n[57] Compare for equally defective perspective the covered portico in\r\n30.\r\n\r\n[58] Visitors to Venice may like to be reminded that most of Ruskin's\r\ncriticism upon Tintoret's works there is now easily accessible in (1)\r\n_The Relation between Michael Angelo and Tintoret_, (2) _The Stones of\r\nVenice_, travellers' edition, and (3) the reissue of the second volume\r\nof _Modern Painters_. Mr. Ruskin always accounted his \"discovery\" of\r\nTintoret as one of the chief works of his life. \"I have supplied,\" he\r\nwrote in _Stones of Venice_ (1853), \"somewhat copious notices of the\r\npictures of Tintoret, because they are much injured, difficult to read,\r\nand entirely neglected by other writers on art.\" \"I say with pride,\"\r\nhe wrote in the epilogue to the second volume of _Modern Painters_\r\n(1883), \"what it has become my duty to express openly, that it was\r\nleft to me, and to me alone, first to discern, and then to teach, so\r\nfar as in this hurried century any such thing _can_ be taught, the\r\nexcellency and supremacy of five great painters, despised until I\r\nspoke of them;--Turner, Tintoret, Luini, Botticelli, and Carpaccio.\r\nDespised,--nay, scarcely in any true sense of the word, known.\" For\r\nthe Pre-Ruskinian view of Tintoret, the reader may consult Kugler's\r\n_Handbook of Painting_.\r\n\r\n[59] For an exhaustive and interesting history of the legend see Mr. J.\r\nR. Anderson's Supplement to _St. Mark's Rest_. One account, it seems,\r\nplaces both Perseus and St. George in the Nile Delta. Politicians who\r\nsay that England has gone to Egypt to save that country from itself may\r\nperhaps see some significance in this. The superstitious in such things\r\nwill not forget either that one of Gordon's names was George.\r\n\r\n[60] It is proper to mention that most of the critics dispute the\r\ngenuineness of this picture, and consider it a copy by some scholar\r\nor imitator. \"It is but a school repetition of a signed picture in\r\nThe Hermitage, with the omission, however, of a charming figure of\r\nSt. Catherine.\" In connection with this disputed point, it may not\r\nbe out of place to recall the famous forgery in which Andrea himself\r\nplayed the chief part. The Duke of Mantua coveted Raphael's portrait of\r\nLeo X., and obtained permission from the Pope to appropriate it. The\r\nowner determined to meet force by fraud, and employed Andrea to make\r\na copy which was sent to the Duke as the original. The copy, when at\r\nMantua, deceived even Giulio Romano, who had himself taken part in the\r\nexecution of the original--a fact which might well induce some modesty\r\nof judgment in connoisseurs.\r\n\r\n[61] The title usually given to this picture, \"Christ Disputing with\r\nthe Doctors,\" cannot be correct, for the figure of Christ is too old\r\nfor an incident which occurred when he was twelve years old.\r\n\r\n[62] In the little-known collection in the library of Christ Church,\r\nOxford, there is a powerful but unpleasantly realistic picture of a\r\ngroup in a butcher's shop, by one of the Carracci, which is perhaps a\r\nfamily portrait.\r\n\r\n[63] See Blake's _Auguries of Innocence_.\r\n\r\n[64] Gaspard was particularly unfaithful to the variety of nature in\r\nhis representation of leaves (see 98). It is interesting therefore,\r\nas showing how long it passed for truth, to note that Lanzi (i. 481)\r\nsingles out this point for special praise: \"Everything that Gaspard\r\nexpresses is founded in nature; in his leaves he is as various as the\r\ntrees themselves.\"\r\n\r\n[65] Compare on this point Claude's \"Isaac and Rebecca,\" No. 12.\r\n\r\n[66] This anecdote is a modern counterpart of that of Protogenes, the\r\nrival of Apelles, who worked continuously, we are told, during the\r\nsiege of Rhodes by Demetrius Poliorcetes, notwithstanding that the\r\ngarden in which he painted was in the middle of the enemy's camp.\r\nDemetrius, unsolicited, took measures for the painter's safety, and\r\nwhen he was told that one of the masterpieces by Protogenes was in a\r\npart of the town exposed to assault, he changed his plan of operations.\r\n\r\n[67] \"If you live in London you may test your progress _accurately_ by\r\nthe degree of admiration you feel for the leaves of vine round the head\r\nof the Bacchus in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne\" (_Elements of Drawing_,\r\np. 82). Another technical beauty referred to in the same book (p. 77\r\n_n._) is \"the points of light on the white flower in the wreath of the\r\ndancing child-faun.\" Similarly, \"the wing of the cupid in Correggio's\r\npicture (10) is focused to two little grains of white at the top of\r\nit.\" Elsewhere Ruskin calls attention to \"the leaves which crown the\r\nBacchus, and the little dancing faun: every turn of the most subtle\r\nperspective, and every gradation of colour, is given with the colossal\r\nease and power of the consummate master\" (_Academy Notes_, 1855, p. 22).\r\n\r\n[68] Ruskin's analysis of Rubens's technical method, which is here\r\nomitted as foreign to the scope of this handbook, will be found in his\r\nreview of Eastlake's _History of Oil Painting_, now reprinted in _On\r\nthe Old Road_, i. §§ 98-136.\r\n\r\n[69] \"The conditions of art in Flanders--wealthy, _bourgeois_, proud,\r\nfree,--were not dissimilar to those of art in Venice. The misty flats\r\nof Belgium have some of the atmospheric qualities of Venice. As Van\r\nEyck is to the Vivarini, so is Rubens to Paolo Veronese. This expresses\r\nthe amount of likeness and difference\" (Symonds: _Renaissance_, iii.\r\n265 _n_).\r\n\r\n[70] See, for a further instance of this, what is said of Rubens's\r\nlandscapes below, under 66.\r\n\r\n[71] Dr. Elisabeth Denio, in her monograph on Poussin (1899), adduces\r\ngood reason for altering the commonly accepted date 1594 to 1593.\r\n\r\n[72] See _Lanzi_, i. 477, and a paper by Mr. R. Heath in the _Magazine\r\nof Art_ for September 1877, where Poussin's theory is illustrated\r\nfrom his pictures in the Louvre. English readers may be reminded that\r\nPoussin is particularly well represented in the Dulwich Gallery.\r\n\r\n[73] Elsewhere Ruskin says of Poussin, \"Whatever he has done has been\r\ndone better by Titian.\" Also, \"the landscape of Nicolo Poussin shows\r\nmuch power, and is usually composed and elaborated on right principles,\r\nbut I am aware of nothing that it has attained of new or peculiar\r\nexcellence; it is a graceful mixture of qualities to be found in other\r\nmasters in higher degrees. In finish it is inferior to Leonardo's, in\r\ninvention to Giorgione's, in truth to Titian's, in grace to Raphael's\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. § 14).\r\n\r\n[74] \"He feared the fascinations of colour, and once wrote from Venice\r\nthat he must flee from a place where they lured him too much. He did\r\nnot know how needless was the alarm\" (Sir F. Burton).\r\n\r\n[75] Constable, who made some studies from this picture, was of the\r\nsame opinion. In a letter to Fisher he describes it as \"a noble\r\nPoussin: a solemn, deep, still summer's noon, with large umbrageous\r\ntrees, and a man washing his feet at a fountain near them. Through the\r\nbreaks in the trees are mountains, and the clouds collecting about them\r\nwith the most enchanting effects possible. It cannot be too much to say\r\nthat this landscape is full of religious and moral feeling\" (Leslie's\r\n_Life of Constable_, p. 90).\r\n\r\n[76] \"Hang these pictures in a very strong light,\" said Rembrandt of\r\nhis early work. \"The smell of paint is not good for the health,\" he\r\nsaid many years afterwards, when a visitor came close up to one of his\r\nlater pictures.\r\n\r\n[77] Baldwin Brown's _The Fine Arts_, p. 298, where Mr. Whistler's\r\nbeautiful description of a \"nocturne\" on the Thames is cited as being\r\nin direct artistic descent from Rembrandt. \"To Rembrandt,\" said the\r\nlate Mr. Wornum (_Epochs of Painting_, 1864, p. 421), \"belongs the\r\nglory of having first embodied in art and perpetuated [such] rare\r\nand beautiful effects of nature\" as are referred to above. Ruskin\r\ntook up the sentence, and replied with characteristic emphasis: \"Such\r\neffects are indeed rare in nature; but they are not rare, absolutely.\r\nThe sky, with the sun in it, does not usually give the impression\r\nof being dimly lighted through a circular hole; but you may observe\r\na very similar effect any day in your coal-cellar. The light is not\r\nRembrandtesque on the current, or banks, of a river; but it is on\r\nthose of a drain. Colour is not Rembrandtesque, usually, in a clean\r\nhouse; but is presently obtainable of that quality in a dirty one. And\r\nwithout denying the pleasantness of the mode of progression, which Mr.\r\nHazlitt, perhaps too enthusiastically, describes (in a criticism upon\r\nthe present picture) as obtainable in a background of Rembrandt's, 'you\r\nstagger from one abyss of obscurity to another,' I cannot feel it an\r\nentirely glorious speciality to be distinguished, as Rembrandt was,\r\nfrom other great painters, chiefly by the liveliness of his darkness,\r\nand the dulness of his light. Glorious or inglorious, the speciality\r\nitself is easily and accurately definable. It is the aim of the best\r\npainters to paint the noblest things they can see by sunlight. It was\r\nthe aim of Rembrandt to paint the foulest things he could see--by\r\nrushlight,\"--a statement from which, of course, deduction must be made,\r\nin forming a general idea of Ruskin's estimate, for his appreciation of\r\nRembrandt's portraits. _See_, _e.g._ under 51.\r\n\r\n[78] To further understand Rembrandt's principle of choice, contrast\r\nthat of Veronese. See the passage quoted under No. 26.\r\n\r\n[79] Yet Rembrandt's pictures are often more deceptive--look more like\r\nreality--than others which are really more true. Why? It is because\r\n\"people are so much more easily and instinctively impressed by force of\r\nlight than truth of colour.... Give them the true contrast of light,\r\nand they will not observe the false local colour.\" The references to\r\nRuskin are _Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. ch. iii. § 16; vol.\r\niv. pt. v. ch. ii. §§ 11-19; vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi. § 10; _On the Old\r\nRoad_, i. 498-505.\r\n\r\n[80] Ruskin, writing to the _Times_ in 1847, said of the then condition\r\nof the picture: \"I have no hesitation in asserting that for the present\r\nit is utterly, and for ever partially, destroyed. I am not disposed\r\nlightly to impugn the judgment of Mr. Eastlake (that is, the then\r\nKeeper and subsequent Director, the late Sir C. L. Eastlake), but this\r\nwas indisputably of all the pictures in the Gallery that which least\r\nrequired, and least could endure, the process of cleaning. It was in\r\nthe most advantageous condition under which a work of Rubens can be\r\nseen; mellowed by time into more perfect harmony than when it left the\r\neasel, enriched and warmed, without losing any of its freshness or\r\nenergy. The execution of the master is always so bold and frank as to\r\nbe completely, perhaps even most agreeably, seen under circumstances of\r\nobscurity, which would be injurious to pictures of greater refinement;\r\nand though this was, indeed, one of his most highly-finished and\r\ncareful works (to my mind, before it suffered this recent injury, far\r\nsuperior to everything at Antwerp, Malines, or Cologne), this was a\r\nmore weighty reason for caution than for interference. Some portions of\r\ncolour have been exhibited which were formerly untraceable; but even\r\nthese have lost in power what they have gained in definitiveness,--the\r\nmajesty and preciousness of all the tones are departed, the balance of\r\ndistances lost. Time may, perhaps, restore something of the glow, but\r\nnever the subordination; and the more delicate portions of flesh tint,\r\nespecially the back of the female figure on the left, and of the boy in\r\nthe centre, are destroyed for ever\" (_Arrows of the Chace_, i, 56, 57).\r\n\r\n[81] The magnificent portrait No. 52 is by some critics ascribed to\r\nRubens. Van Dyck hardly ever signed his pictures.\r\n\r\n[82] Not all artists have learnt from this great work gladly. It was\r\nexhibited at the first exhibition of \"Old Masters\" at the British\r\nInstitution in 1815, and B. R. Haydon tells the following story:\r\n\"Lawrence was looking at the Gevartius when I was there, and as he\r\nturned round, to my wonder, his face was boiling with rage as he grated\r\nout between his teeth, 'I suppose they think we want teaching!'\"\r\n(_Autobiography_, i. 292).\r\n\r\n[83] Such is the tradition. By many modern critics the picture is, on\r\ninternal evidence, taken away from Van Dyck and given to Rubens. Mr.\r\nWatts in the article cited above says: \"Attributed to Van Dyck, but\r\nhardly, I think, suggesting his work, though it would be difficult to\r\nattribute it to any other painter, unless, perhaps, on some occasion\r\nRubens might have been inspired with so fervent a love for art that he\r\nforgot his satisfaction in scattering his over-ripe dexterity.\"\r\n\r\n[84] The statement found in many biographies of the painter that he was\r\na brewer is a mistake. It arose from the fact that his daughter married\r\na brewer, and that the painter himself was buried from his son-in-law's\r\nbrewery.\r\n\r\n[85] See _Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. vii. ch. iv. § 13.\r\n\r\n[86] Ruskin (_ibid._, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. iv. § 16) notices\r\nthis treatment of Apollo under the head of \"Imagination Contemplative,\"\r\nas an instance of an imaginative abstraction \"in which the form of one\r\nthing is fancifully indicated in the matter of another; as in phantoms\r\nand cloud shapes, the use of which, in mighty hands, is often most\r\nimpressive, as in the cloudy-charioted Apollo of Nicolo Poussin in our\r\nown Gallery, which the reader may oppose to the substantial Apollo in\r\nWilson's Niobe,\" see No. 110.\r\n\r\n[87] This figure is specially good. It was to rival this great\r\nlandscape that James Ward (see 688), as he avows in his autobiography,\r\npainted his \"Fighting Bulls,\" now in the South Kensington Museum. \"How\r\nfull of lithe natural movement,\" says Mr. J. T. Nettleship, \"is the\r\nman in the foreground, in heavy boots and feathered hat, stooping and\r\ncreeping towards the covey of partridges under cover of bramble and\r\nbush, compared with the clumsy anatomical bulls in Ward's picture\"\r\n(_George Morland_, p. 54).\r\n\r\n[88] Ruskin is here speaking of the somewhat similar \"St. George\"\r\npicture in the Church of St. James at Antwerp.\r\n\r\n[89] See also No. 98, in which the tree is said by Ruskin to be \"a mere\r\njest\" compared to this.\r\n\r\n[90] No. 78 was formerly Sir Joshua Reynolds's \"Holy Family,\" on which\r\nnotes will be found in Volume II. of this Handbook. The picture has now\r\nbeen withdrawn from exhibition and little remains of it, for owing to\r\nthe excessive use of asphaltum the pigments have disappeared.\r\n\r\n[91] \"Garofano\" is the Italian for \"gillyflower\" (or clove-pink),\r\nand Tisio sometimes painted this flower as his sign-manual (like Mr.\r\nWhistler's butterfly).\r\n\r\n[92] Authorities differ between this title and \"Pan teaching Apollo to\r\nplay on the pipes.\" Certainly there is the \"Pan's pipe,\" but then if\r\nit is Pan he ought to have goat's legs and horns. The fact that the\r\npicture is a companion to \"Silenus gathering Grapes\" makes also in\r\nfavour of the description given in the text above.\r\n\r\n[93] See also Ruskin's remarks on the companion storm piece, No. 36.\r\n\r\n[94] It should be noted that this, as well as very many other pictures,\r\nhas of late years been cleaned. Thus 98 and 68 (in 1880), 36 and 40 (in\r\n1868), have been \"cleaned and varnished.\" 31 was \"relined, repaired,\r\nand varnished\" in 1878; 161 was \"cleaned and repaired\" in 1868.\r\n\r\n[95] The diminutive title \"Il Canaletto\" was originally applied\r\nto Antonio's nephew and pupil, Bernardo Bellotto, but came to be\r\ntransferred to Antonio Canale himself. The two Canaletti painted so\r\nmuch alike that their works are not easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n[96] Ruskin, on one of his latest visits to the National Gallery\r\n(1887), confessed that he had found himself admiring Canaletto. \"After\r\nall,\" he said to me, \"he was a good workman in oils, whereas so much\r\nof Turner's work is going to rack and ruin.\" Ruskin had made a similar\r\nconcession long before to Claude. Writing to Mr. Fawkes on the death\r\nof Turner, he mentions a rumour that the artist had left only his\r\nfinished pictures to the nation. \"Alas! these are finished in a double\r\nsense--nothing but chilled fragments of paint on rotten canvas. The\r\nClaudites will have a triumph when they get into the National Gallery\"\r\n(quoted in _The Nineteenth Century_, April 1900).\r\n\r\n[97] An amusing instance of the naïve ignorance of the sea which\r\nunderlay much of the excessive admiration of Vandevelde is afforded by\r\nDr. Waagen, for many years director of the Berlin Gallery, and author\r\nof _Treasures of Art in England_. At the end of a passage describing\r\nhis \"first attempt to navigate the watery paths,\" he says: \"For the\r\nfirst time I understood the truth of these pictures (Bakhuizen's and\r\nVandevelde's), and the refined art with which, by intervening dashes\r\nof sunshine, near or at a distance, and _ships to animate the scene_,\r\nthey produce such a charming variety on the surface of the sea.\" \"For\r\nthe first time!\" exclaims Ruskin (_Arrows of the Chace_, i. 16, 17),\r\n\"and yet this gallery-bred judge, this discriminator of coloured\r\nshreds and canvas patches, who has no idea how ships animate the sea\r\nuntil--charged with the fates of the Royal Academy--he ventures his\r\ninvaluable person from Rotterdam to Greenwich, will walk up to the work\r\nof a man whose brow is hard with the spray of a hundred storms, and\r\ncharacterise it as 'wanting in truth of clouds and waves.'\" Dr. Waagen,\r\nit should be explained, had, on the strength of his first \"navigation\r\nof the watery ways\" pronounced Turner's works inferior in such truth to\r\nVandevelde. Clearly Dr. Waagen, more fortunate than most of our foreign\r\nvisitors, had a calm crossing.\r\n\r\n[98] It is interesting that another contemporary man of letters, the\r\nlate Matthew Arnold, singled out these same lines for special praise:\r\n\"No passage in poetry,\" he said, \"has moved and pleased me more\"\r\n(_Fortnightly Review_, August 1887, p. 299).\r\n\r\n[99] In this town were born two other painters, who are sometimes known\r\nby its name. Curiously enough, all three were originally masons.\r\n\r\n[100] Ruskin speaks of \"the ruffian Caravaggio, distinguished only by\r\nhis preference of candle-light and black shadows for the illustration\r\nand reinforcement of villainy\" (_On the Old Road_, i. § 48).\r\n\r\n[101] According to Morelli (_Italian Masters in German Galleries_,\r\np. 56 _n._), this familiar tale is legendary, Francia being merely\r\nan abbreviation of his Christian name, Francesco. But the painter\r\nsometimes signed his name Franciscus Francia, a form which on Morelli's\r\nhypothesis would be tautological.\r\n\r\n[102] Francia's friendship with Raphael, on which art historians\r\nhave based many theories and spun many interesting tales, is now\r\ndiscredited, the documents in question being comparatively modern\r\nforgeries (see p. 366 of Kugler's _Italian Schools of Painting_, 5th\r\nedition, revised by Sir A. H. Layard, 1887, elsewhere referred to as\r\n_Layard_).\r\n\r\n[103] Vasari's story that Francia died of chagrin on seeing how far the\r\nwhole work of his own life was transcended by Raphael's picture of St.\r\nCecilia, which was sent to its destination at Bologna about 1516, is\r\nhardly credible.\r\n\r\n[104] Ruskin said of this picture in 1847: \"The attribution to him of\r\nthe wretched panel which now bears his name is a mere insult\" (_Arrows\r\nof the Chace_, i. 64). \"Petrus Peruginus\" is inscribed in gold on the\r\nbase of the mantle of the Virgin, but the picture may be the work of\r\nhis disciple, Lo Spagna (see 1032).\r\n\r\n[105] Up to the time of the Van Eycks the general process of artistic\r\npainting for detached pictures was tempera. In this method the colours,\r\nafter being ground with chalk, were laid on with a medium of water,\r\nwhite of eggs, juice of unripe figs, or some similar substance. Some\r\nkind of oil varnish was, however, often laid on afterwards, and a few\r\nItalian artists sometimes tried to mix their colours with oil in the\r\nfirst instance; but the results cannot have been satisfactory, for even\r\nCrivelli, who died in 1495, was still exclusively a painter in tempera.\r\nThe objection to tempera, so far at any rate as northern countries\r\nwere concerned, was that it suffered from the damp. Thus in an old\r\nretable in Westminster Abbey, so painted, the painting has flaked off.\r\nThe objection to the early attempts at using oil as a medium was that\r\nit took a long time to dry. This caused Van Eyck incessant annoyance;\r\nhis knowledge of chemistry led him to make experiments, and at last he\r\nobtained a medium which hastened the drying without the necessity of\r\nexposure to the sun. This medium was probably a mixture of linseed and\r\nnut oils. This method is different from that now called oil-painting.\r\nNow the colours are laid on by an oily medium, and when the picture is\r\nfinished the whole surface is protected by a transparent varnish. Then\r\nthe varnish was incorporated with the surface colours (see Conway's\r\n_Early Flemish Artists_, p. 119; and Wauters's _Flemish School of\r\nPainting_, p. 35).\r\n\r\n[106] _Arrows of the Chace_, i. 66. \"John Bellini is the only artist\r\nwho appears to me to have united, in equal and magnificent measures,\r\njustness of drawing, nobleness of colouring, and perfect manliness\r\nof treatment, with the purest religious feeling. He did, as far as\r\nit is possible to do it, instinctively and unaffectedly, what the\r\nCarracci only pretended to do. Titian colours better, but has not his\r\npiety; Leonardo draws better, but has not his colour; Angelico is\r\nmore heavenly, but has not his manliness, far less his powers of art\"\r\n(_Stones of Venice_, Venetian Index). Morelli's estimate is the same;\r\nsee _German Galleries_, p. 361.\r\n\r\n[107] This letter of Dürer's gives an interesting glimpse into the art\r\nlife of the time. \"I have many good friends among the Italians, who\r\nwarn me not to eat and drink with their painters. Many also of them\r\nare my enemies; they copy my things for the churches, picking them\r\nup whenever they can. Yet they abuse my style, saying that it is not\r\nantique art, and that therefore it is not good. But Giambellini has\r\npraised me much before many gentlemen; he wishes to have something of\r\nmine; he came to me and begged me to do something for him, and is quite\r\nwilling to pay for it. And every one gives him such a good character\r\nthat I feel an affection for him. He is very old, and is yet the best\r\nin painting; and the thing which pleased me so well eleven years ago\r\nhas now no attractions for me\" (_Catalogue of Standard Series in the\r\nRuskin Drawing School_, P. 7).\r\n\r\n[108] See _Report of Select Committee on the National Gallery_, 1853,\r\np. 432, where the whole story will be found very frankly told in Sir C.\r\nEastlake's evidence.\r\n\r\n[109] Similarly Raphael Mengs, a later Spanish painter, said of\r\nVelazquez that he appeared to have painted with his will only, without\r\nthe aid of his hand.\r\n\r\n[110] I read the other day in an otherwise intelligent memoir of\r\nRuskin that \"a generation which admired Velazquez had outlived the art\r\ncriticism of Ruskin.\" Not outlived, but absorbed, and so forgotten.\r\nIt was Ruskin who, half a century before, proclaimed the consummate\r\nexcellence of Velazquez--the \"greatest artist of Spain,\" and \"one of\r\nthe great artists of the world\"; the master to all schools in his\r\n\"consummate ease\"; the man who was \"never wrong.\" In his admiration of\r\nVelazquez Ruskin never wavered. The citations above given are from his\r\nearlier books. In his later period, a picture by Velazquez was included\r\namong the \"Four Lesson Photographs\" as \"an example of the highest reach\r\nof technical perfection yet reached in art; all effort and labour\r\nseeming to cease in the radiant peace and simplicity of consummated\r\nhuman power\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1876, p. 188).\r\n\r\n[111] This was written in 1846. In 1853 some \"horrible revelations\"\r\nwere made about the picture before the Select Committee on the National\r\nGallery. Ruskin turned out to be curiously wrong, but also curiously\r\nright. He was wrong; for so far from the picture being \"in genuine and\r\nperfect condition,\" a considerable portion of the canvas, as we now\r\nsee it, turned out to be not by Velazquez's hand at all. Lord Cowley,\r\nits former owner, had sent it to a Mr. Thane, a picture dealer, to be\r\nrelined. A too hot iron was used, and a portion of the paint entirely\r\ndisappeared. Thane was in despair. The picture haunted him at nights.\r\nHe saw the figure of it in his dreams becoming more and more attenuated\r\nuntil it appeared at length a skeleton. He was near going mad over\r\nit, when a good angel came to his rescue in the shape of Lance, the\r\nflower and fruit painter, who offered to restore the missing parts\r\nout of his head. So far Ruskin was decidedly wrong. But he was also\r\nright. The parts which Lance painted in \"out of his head\" were the\r\ngroups on the left of the foreground, and some of the middle distance.\r\n\"I endeavoured,\" he says, \"to fill up the canvas, such as I supposed\r\nVelazquez would have done; and I had great facility in doing that,\r\nbecause if there was a man without a horse here, there was a horse\r\nwithout a man there, so I could easily take his execution as nearly\r\nas possible, and my own style of painting enabled me to keep pretty\r\nnear the mark\"(!). But the high lights of the sky, he particularly\r\nadded, were untouched by him. So that there Ruskin was right. The\r\npicture, when restored to its owner, gave complete satisfaction,\r\nand Lance's share in it was kept a secret. A year or two later he\r\nmust have felt a proud man. The picture was being exhibited at the\r\nBritish Gallery. In front of it Lance met two _cognoscenti_ of his\r\nacquaintance. \"It looks to me,\" he said, testing them, \"as if it had\r\nbeen a good deal repainted.\"--\"No! you're wrong there,\" they said; \"it\r\nis remarkably free from repaints.\" It should be added that soon after\r\nthe Parliamentary inquiry referred to above, a tracing of Goya's copy,\r\nprocured from Madrid, showed in fact that the restored work differed\r\nbut slightly from the copy, and Lance's work was probably far less\r\nimportant and extensive than he asserted. An idea of the original\r\ncondition of the picture may be had from a reduced replica, or first\r\nsketch, now in the Wallace Collection.\r\n\r\n[112] The view Diderot thus took of Greuze's art suggests the\r\nimportance of historical perspective in criticism. Pictures, like\r\neverything else, should be judged with reference to contemporary\r\ncircumstances, as well as by the standard of abstract principle. From\r\nthe former point of view Greuze, as we have seen, is a moralist in\r\npainting. From the latter Ruskin suggests the consideration \"how far\r\nthe value of a girl's head by Greuze would be lowered in the market if\r\nthe dress, which now leaves the bosom bare, were raised to the neck\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt. iv. chap. v. § 7).\r\n\r\n[113] Another instance of this intimate union of art with business may\r\nbe seen in the number of Dutch artists of the period who themselves\r\nheld municipal office. See, for instance, Terburg (864) and Delen\r\n(1010). Many of the Italian painters also were men of business and of\r\nofficial standing. Thus Titian was a timber merchant; whilst Manni,\r\nPerugino, and Pinturicchio were all magistrates.\r\n\r\n[114] \"The bit of bluish ribbed paper on which he made his design\r\nin light and dark strokes, now gone brown, and which he had pricked\r\nthrough for the purpose of tracing the design on the panel, is framed\r\nbeside it. He left it about, not thinking that in 350 years it would\r\nbe under glass in the distant city of London, stared at by English\r\nroughs, who would say, \"Sithee Bill, he's pricked it a' through with\r\na pin, and spilt th' ile on it!\" for there are two or three of these\r\namber-coloured blurs which come from a sketch being inadvertently put\r\ndown on a palette knife\" (_Letters of James Smetham_, p. 168).\r\n\r\n[115] These pictures, like the other Florentine works here exhibited,\r\nexcept 564 (which is on linen cloth attached to wood) and 276 (which is\r\nin fresco), are painted in tempera on wood. _Tempera_ (or distemper)\r\npainting is a generic term for the various methods in which some\r\nother substance than oil was the medium. Various substances were thus\r\nused--such as gum, glue or size, flour-paste, white of egg, milk of\r\nfigs. Cennino Cennini, who wrote a treatise on painting at the end of\r\nthe fourteenth century, professes to give the exact method of Giotto.\r\nEgg beaten up with water was preferred by him, except where the\r\nyellowness of the mixture injured the purity of the colour. The colours\r\nthus mixed were laid on to a panel (or on to a cloth stretched over the\r\npanel) previously prepared with a smooth white ground of plaster. And\r\nfinally oil or albumen was used to go over the whole surface. This was\r\nthe practice in general use for all detached pictures until the middle\r\nof the fifteenth century, when what is known as \"the Van Eyck method\"\r\ncame into vogue (see under 186).\r\n\r\n=Fresco= painting is painting upon walls of wet plaster with earths of\r\ndifferent colours diluted with water. It is so called from the colour\r\nbeing applied to the _fresh_ wet surface of lime, but it is of two\r\nkinds: (1) _fresco secco_, when the plaster of lime has been allowed\r\nto _dry_ on the wall and is then saturated with water before painting;\r\nthis was the method in use till after Giotto's time; (2) _buon fresco_,\r\nwhen the colours are laid on to the fresh plaster before it is yet dry.\r\n(The fullest account of these various technical processes and their\r\nhistory is Sir C. Eastlake's \"Materials for a History of Oil Painting,\"\r\na review of which by Ruskin appeared in the _Quarterly Review_, and is\r\nreprinted in _On the Old Road_, vol. i.).\r\n\r\n[116] The note in the Official Catalogue says that the picture does not\r\ncorrespond in the scheme of colour to the works of Velazquez's early\r\nperiod. On the other hand, \"it shows so decided an affinity with the\r\nfine picture by Zurbaran, in the Palace of San Telmo, at Seville, not\r\nonly in colouring but in every detail of the treatment, that there\r\ncan be no doubt that the attribution to Velazquez was an error, and\r\nthat Zurbaran is the true painter of this beautiful work, which may\r\nbe considered the best picture he ever painted.\" But \"we would fain\r\nsee proof,\" says another critic, \"that Zurbaran ever painted a head\r\nlike that of the Divine Child. The rest of the picture recalls the\r\nearly Seville manner of Velazquez in the style of Ribera\" (_Quarterly\r\nReview_, April 1899).\r\n\r\n[117] This picture, when first purchased for the National Gallery in\r\n1853, was ascribed to Giorgione. For many years it was given to the\r\n\"School of Bellini.\" In 1883 it was identified by Messrs. Crowe and\r\nCavalcaselle as a work by Catena. Signor Morelli and other critics\r\nof his school supported this view, which in 1898 was adopted by the\r\nauthorities of the Gallery. No. 694 has also been so attributed to him\r\nin the Catalogue. Other pictures which have at one time or another been\r\nconnected with Catena are 599, 812, and 1160.\r\n\r\n[118] \"The roguish little terrier pretends not to see what is going\r\non. But what are the partridges doing behind the chair of the Blessed\r\nVirgin? Was the Knight a worldling, given to sport, but arrested in\r\nthe pursuit of pleasure by some inward voice or vision; and so, taking\r\nthe result of the day's work, he lays it at the feet of the Divine\r\nChild and His Mother? Or was worship simply the pious Knight's godly\r\ncommencement of the day? Why, too, is the dog so sly looking? Is that\r\nlittle mass of curly white wool a sceptic, doubting his master's good\r\nresolutions?\" (Sophia Beale in _Good Words_, July 1895).\r\n\r\n[119] Ruskin, in his classification of artists from this point of view,\r\ncalls them \"sensualists,\" reserving the traditional title \"naturalists\"\r\nto the greatest men, whose \"subject is infinite as nature, their colour\r\nequally balanced splendour and sadness, reaching occasionally the\r\nhighest degrees of both, and their chiaroscuro equally balanced between\r\nlight and shade.\" This class represents the proper mean. In excess on\r\none side are the \"purists\" (Angelico, Perugino, Memlinc, Stothard), who\r\ntake the good and leave the evil. \"The faces of their figures express\r\nno evil passions; the skies of their landscapes are without storm;\r\nthe prevalent character of their colour is brightness, and of their\r\nchiaroscuro fulness of light.\" Then in excess on the other side are\r\nthe \"sensualists\" (Salvator Rosa, Caravaggio, Ribera), who \"perceive\r\nand imitate evil only. They cannot draw the trunk of a tree without\r\nblasting and shattering it, nor a sky except covered with stormy\r\nclouds; they delight in the beggary and brutality of the human race;\r\ntheir colour is for the most part subdued or lurid, and the greatest\r\nspaces of their pictures are occupied by darkness\" (_Stones of Venice_,\r\nvol. ii. ch. vi.). Elsewhere, Ruskin speaks of Caravaggio and Ribera as\r\n\"the black slaves of painting\" (_Elements of Drawing_, p. 317).\r\n\r\n[120] This is the story told by Dominici, the Neapolitan historian.\r\nAccording to Cean Bermudez, following Palomino (the Spanish historian),\r\nRibera died at Naples honoured and rich.\r\n\r\n[121] The tradition that he was a natural son of the Barbarella family,\r\nand in consequence called Barbarelli, appears to be unfounded.\r\n\r\n[122] \"Two figures of Giorgione's are still traceable, one of them\r\n(wrote Ruskin in 1846), singularly uninjured, is seen from far above\r\nand below the Rialto, flaming like the reflection of a sunset\" (_Modern\r\nPainters_ vol. i. ed. 3 pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. § 30). This beautiful\r\nfigure was engraved by Ruskin for his fifth volume; he called her from\r\nher glowing colour \"the Hesperid Aeglé.\"\r\n\r\n[123] Ruskin's seven are Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, Tintoret,\r\nCorreggio, Reynolds, and Turner (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch.\r\nxi, § 8, _n_).\r\n\r\n[124] A reaction in this respect is observable in the latest writer on\r\nGiorgione (Mr. Herbert Cook in the \"Great Masters\" Series), who shows\r\ngood cause for restoring many pictures to the master. The National\r\nGallery, he says (p. 95), affords unrivalled opportunity for studying\r\nthe various phases of Giorgione at different stages of his career. Nos.\r\n1160 and 1173 represent his earliest style; No. 1123, his later; Nos.\r\n269 and 636 are intermediate.\r\n\r\n[125] A contemporary document, recently discovered, proves that\r\nthe artist died of the plague. (See appendix to Mr. Herbert Cook's\r\n_Giorgione_, 1900).\r\n\r\n[126] Lecture at Oxford 1884 (reported in Cook's _Studies in Ruskin_,\r\np. 251). See also the \"Traveller's edition\" of the _Stones of Venice_,\r\nvol. ii. ch. vi., where the picture is described as \"one which unites\r\nevery artistic quality for which the painting of Venice has become\r\nrenowned with a depth of symbolism and nobleness of manner exemplary of\r\nall that in any age of art has characterised its highest masters.\" A\r\ncopy of this masterpiece is in the collection of the Arundel Society,\r\nnow to be seen in the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n[127] In an interesting discussion with Sir J. E. Millais, R.A., Mr.\r\nWatts, R.A., refers to the colours in this picture. Sir J. Millais\r\nhad said that time and age are the greatest old masters, and that old\r\nVenetian colours were crude. Mr. Watts replied: \"The colour of the\r\nbest-preserved pictures by Titian shows a marked distinction between\r\nlight flesh tones and white drapery. This is most distinctly seen in\r\nthe small 'Noli me Tangere' in our National Gallery, in the so-called\r\n'Venus' of the Tribune, and in the 'Flora' of the Uffizi, both in\r\nFlorence, and in Bronzino's 'All is Vanity,' also in the National\r\nGallery (651). In the last-named picture, for example, the colour is\r\nas crude and the surface as bare of mystery as if it had been painted\r\nyesterday. As a matter of fact, white unquestionably tones down, but\r\nnever becomes colour; indeed, under favourable conditions, and having\r\ndue regard to what is underneath, it changes very little. In the 'Noli\r\nme Tangere,' to which I have referred, the white sleeve of the Magdalen\r\nis still a beautiful white, quite different from the white of the\r\nfairest of Titian's flesh--proving that Titian never painted his flesh\r\nwhite\" (_Magazine of Art_, January 1889).\r\n\r\n[128] Or possibly at Vicenza. See _Layard_, i. 283 n. The words in the\r\ndocument relied upon to establish his birth at Vicenza are ambiguous,\r\nand may refer to his father.\r\n\r\n[129] Its ascription to Botticelli's own hand is, however, questioned\r\nby many critics. Thus Dr. Richter says, \"I know of no authentic picture\r\nby Botticelli in which the drawing of the hands and feet is so poor\r\nand coarse as are here, for instance, those of the Infant Saviour; the\r\ntype of the child is positively repulsive, whereas in Botticelli's own\r\nworks it is pre-eminently in the representation of the Infant Christ\r\nthat his great merits are strikingly apparent\" (_Lectures on the\r\nNational Gallery_, p. 62). The child, whether painted by Botticelli or\r\nby another hand, is undeniably ugly; but the expression of the Madonna,\r\nand the figures of the Baptist and the Angel seem to me to show\r\ncertainly the work of the master himself. Moreover, the critics who\r\ndispute the authenticity of this picture admit that of No. 915. Yet,\r\nas \"D. S. M.\" says, \"the mother here is the same person as the Venus,\r\nlooking out of the picture with the same effect of gentle detachment,\r\ncircumscribed with the same draughtsman's lines; the infant, whose type\r\nDr. Richter finds 'positively repulsive,' is the same infant as the\r\nSatyrs of the other picture, and so all through\" (_Saturday Review_,\r\nFeb. 18, 1899). On the back of the panel is written in the style of\r\nthe 16th century the name of Giuliano da San Gallo, the celebrated\r\narchitect, who was also a painter. There are drawings from his hand in\r\nthe British Museum, which show that he came from Botticelli's school.\r\nHis name on the back of this picture proves, it is argued, that it is\r\nby him. It may, however, very probably only signify that the picture\r\nformerly belonged to him.\r\n\r\n[130] Mr. Pater, in a well-known passage, gives a different explanation\r\nof the peculiar sentiment in Botticelli's Madonnas. \"Perhaps you have\r\nsometimes wondered why they attract you more and more, and often\r\ncome--although conformed to no obvious type of beauty--back to you when\r\nthe Madonnas of Raphael and the Virgins of Fra Angelico are forgotten.\r\nAt first, contrasting them with those, you may have thought that there\r\nwas something even mean or abject in them, for the lines of the face\r\nhave little nobleness, and the colour is wan. For with Botticelli she\r\ntoo, though she holds in her hands the 'Desire of all Nations,' is one\r\nof those who are neither for God nor for his enemies (see under III.\r\n1126), and her choice is on her face. She shrinks from the presence of\r\nthe Divine Child, and pleads in unmistakable undertones for a warmer,\r\nlower humanity\" (W. H. Pater: _Studies of the Renaissance_).\r\n\r\n    You promise heavens free from strife,\r\n      Pure truth and perfect change of will;\r\n    But sweet, sweet is this human life,\r\n      So sweet I fain would breathe it still.\r\n    Your chilly stars I can forgo:\r\n      This warm, kind world is all I know.\r\n\r\n  IONICA: _Mimnermus in Church_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[131]\r\n\r\n    The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle\r\n    That's curdied by the frost from purest snow\r\n    And hangs on Dian's temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n[132] The doors of the temple of \"two-headed Janus\" at Rome were always\r\nthrown open when the State was at war, and only closed in time of peace.\r\n\r\n[133] The whole, or part, of this picture was at one time freely\r\nascribed to Raphael; but Morelli has effectually disposed of the\r\nsuperstition by showing, amongst other arguments, that the drawings\r\nfor Tobias and the Angel (in the Oxford University Gallery and in\r\nthe British Museum) are undoubtedly by Perugino (_Italian Art in the\r\nGerman Galleries_, 1883, p. 289). The Oxford drawing is described\r\nand discussed, on the assumption that it is by Raphael, in Sir J. C.\r\nRobinson's _Drawings by Michael Angelo and Raffaello_, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[134] For a record of his movements the reader may refer to Morelli's\r\n_Italian Masters in German Galleries_, 1883, pp. 285-291.\r\n\r\n[135] Vasari's bias against the Umbrian master is too marked for any of\r\nhis attacks to be accepted without corroboration.\r\n\r\n[136] In a critique of F. Walker's \"Fishmongers' Stalls,\" Ruskin says:\r\n\"If the reader will waste five minutes of his season in London in the\r\nNational Gallery, he may see in the hand of Perugino's Tobias a fish\r\nworth all these on the boards together\" (_Arrows of the Chace_, i. 177).\r\n\r\n[137] With regard to the \"purist ideal\" it should be noticed that\r\n\"these fantasies of the earlier painters, though they darkened faith,\r\nnever hardened _feeling_; on the contrary, the frankness of their\r\nunlikelihood proceeded mainly from the endeavour on the part of the\r\npainter to express, not the actual fact, but the enthusiastic state\r\nof his own feelings about the fact; he covers the Virgin's dress with\r\ngold, not with any idea of representing the Virgin as she ever was,\r\nor ever will be seen, but with a burning desire to show what his love\r\nand reverence would think fittest for her. He erects for the stable\r\na Lombardic portico, not because he supposes the Lombardi to have\r\nbuilt stables in Palestine in the days of Tiberius, but to show that\r\nthe manger in which Christ was laid is, in his eyes, nobler than the\r\ngrandest architecture in the world. He fills his landscape with church\r\nspires and silver streams, not because he supposes that either were in\r\nsight at Bethlehem, but to remind the beholder of the peaceful course\r\nand succeeding power of Christianity\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. iii. pt.\r\niv. ch. iv. § 10). For a different kind of feeling in \"naturalistic\"\r\nart, see under 744.\r\n\r\n[138] Visitors who are interested in such points of connoisseurship\r\nmay be glad of this summary with regard to the works ascribed in the\r\nOfficial Catalogue to the associated painters, Fra Filippo Lippi,\r\nFilippino Lippi, and Botticelli. The _undisputed_ pictures of Fra\r\nFilippo are 248, 666, and 667; of Filippino, 293 and 927. The pictures\r\n592 and 1033 have marked resemblances both to Fra Filippo, Filippino,\r\nand to Botticelli, and are ascribed by different critics to one or\r\nother of those masters or pupils. 598 and 1124 are often ascribed\r\nto a pupil of Filippino; the pictures 586 and 589 to a pupil of Fra\r\nFilippo. The _undisputed_ pictures of Botticelli are 1034 and 1126. The\r\npictures 226, 275, 782, 915, and 916, are all ascribed by some critics\r\nto a pupil of his only, whilst to Botticelli himself has now been\r\nascribed the portrait 626, formerly classed as \"Unknown.\" To a supposed\r\npainter, christened by the critics \"Amico di Sandro,\" 1124 and 1412 are\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\n[139] _Layard_, ii. 621. Similarly Ruskin says: \"The possession of\r\nthe Pisani Veronese will happily enable the English public and the\r\nEnglish artist to convince themselves how sincerity and simplicity\r\nin statements of fact, power of draughtsmanship, and joy in colour,\r\nwere associated in a perfect balance in the great workmen in Venice\"\r\n(_Catalogue of the Turner Sketches and Drawings_, 1858, p. 10). As\r\nan instance of Veronese's \"economical work\"--a sure sign of a great\r\npainter--Ruskin refers to \"the painting of the pearls on the breast of\r\nthe nearer princess, in our best Paul Veronese. The lowest is about\r\nthe size of a small hazel nut, and falls on her rose-red dress. Any\r\nother but a Venetian would have put a complete piece of white paint\r\nover the dress, for the whole pearl, and painted that into the colours\r\nof the stone. But Veronese knows beforehand that all the dark side of\r\nthe pearl will reflect the red of the dress. He will not put white over\r\nthe red, only to put red over the white again. He leaves the actual\r\ndress for the dark side of the pearl, and with two small separate\r\ntouches, one white, another brown, places its high light and shadow.\r\nThis he does with perfect care and calm: but in two decisive seconds.\r\nThere is no dash nor display, nor hurry, nor error. The exactly right\r\nthing is done in the exactly right place, and not one atom of colour,\r\nnor moment of time spent vainly. Look close at the two touches,--you\r\nwonder what they mean. Retire six feet from the picture--the pearl is\r\nthere!\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. viii. ch. iv. § 18). \"One of\r\nthe chief delights which any one who really enjoys painting finds in\r\nthat art as distinct from sculpture, is in the exquisite inlaying or\r\njoiner's work of it, the fitting of edge to edge with a manual skill,\r\nprecisely correspondent to the close application of crowded notes\r\nwithout the least slur, in fine harp or piano-playing. In many of the\r\nfinest works of colour on a large scale, there is even some admission\r\nof the quality given to a painted window by the dark lead bars between\r\nthe pieces of glass. Both Tintoret and Veronese, when they paint on\r\ndark grounds, continually stop short with their tints just before they\r\ntouch others, leaving the dark ground showing between in a narrow bar.\r\nIn the Paul Veronese in the National Gallery, you will find every here\r\nand there pieces of outline which you would suppose were drawn with\r\na brown pencil. But no! look close, and you will find that they are\r\nthe dark ground _left_ between two tints, brought close to each other\r\nwithout touching\" (_Lectures on Landscape_, § 68). Elsewhere, Ruskin\r\ncalls special attention to the painting of \"the drooped left hand of\r\nthe princess, holding her crown\" (_Academy Notes_, 1858, p. 46).\r\n\r\n[140] An even more striking instance is to be found in Veronese's\r\npicture of the Last Supper, now in the Academy of Venice. Here\r\ntoo he introduced his favourite dog, as well as dwarfs and armed\r\nretainers. He was summoned before the Inquisition for such irreverent\r\nanachronisms; and the account of his cross-examination is most amusing\r\nand instructive reading. A translation will be found in the appendix to\r\nRuskin's _Guide to the Academy at Venice_.\r\n\r\n[141] Some readers may like to be referred to the passages in which\r\nRuskin discusses the place of the dog in art, with special reference\r\nto Veronese. They are, _Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. ix. ch. vi., and\r\n_The Eagle's Nest_, i. ch. viii.\r\n\r\n[142] Richter (_Italian Art in the National Gallery_, p. 74) disputes\r\nthis. The kneeling girls are, he believes, the artist's daughters, whom\r\nhe has also introduced into a picture in the Louvre, and the courtier\r\npresenting them is Veronese himself.\r\n\r\n[143] The pattern of the Madonna's robe in this picture is worth\r\nnotice--\"a good specimen of the treatment, probably taken from Persian\r\nexamples, of a ground sprinkled with conventional sprays of flowers\r\nspaced regularly\" (Vacher).\r\n\r\n[144] The three portraits, 1022, 1023, and 1025, formerly in the Casa\r\nFenaroli at Brescia, were there all attributed to Moretto. Signor\r\nMorelli was the first to recognise in the two former the hand and mind\r\nof Moroni, under whose name they were sold to the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n[145] Mr. Dickes's ingenious and interesting explanation is now\r\naccepted by the authorities, and there can be little doubt of its\r\ncorrectness. The motto had previously been misread as του λιαν ποθω\r\nwhich was interpreted \"by the desire of the extreme.\" The picture was\r\nfor many years in the possession of the Martinengo Cesaresco family,\r\nand passed for a portrait of their ancestor Count Sciarra. The motto\r\nwas interpreted as referring to the Count's desire to avenge the death\r\nof his father, who had been assassinated. The desire of the extreme,\r\nthe activity of a restless spirit, was with the Count to the end, and\r\nhe died fighting in France in the campaign which ended in a defeat of\r\nthe Huguenots at the battle of Moncontour, October 3, 1569. But the\r\nCount Sciarra was a soldier-adventurer, showing no characteristics\r\naccordant with the nobleman before us other than that, according to a\r\nBrescian historian, \"his eyes gleamed with an unconquerable desire.\"\r\nBut the inscription is undoubtedly as given in the text, the accents\r\nbeing all clearly marked. The portrait is clearly not of a restless man\r\nof action, so much as of a dilettante. The dates of the Count Sciarra's\r\ncareer are also inconsistent with his being painted in this picture\r\nof Moretto's best period. The statements on behalf of the traditional\r\nidentification made by the Contessa Evelyn Martinengo Cesaresco\r\n(_Athenæum_, Aug. 12, 1893) do not touch the points.\r\n\r\n[146] The feeling which one may thus find in these paintings of\r\nfour centuries ago still lingers amongst the Italian peasantry, as\r\nreaders of Miss Alexander's _Roadside Songs_ and _Christ's Folk in the\r\nApennine_ (both edited by Mr. Ruskin) will know.\r\n\r\n[147] It may be worth noting that, according to the son of Turner's\r\nfriend, Trimmer, this picture \"had an entire new sky painted at the\r\ndesire of Lawrence and other brother artists, who, when he had altered\r\nit, said the picture was ruined\" (Thornbury's _Life of Turner_, i. 175).\r\n\r\n[148] Dr. Richter, in laying down the law to the contrary, gives\r\ntoo narrow an interpretation to Vasari's words. The Margaritone is\r\ncertainly inferior to the best Byzantine work, but it adheres to the\r\ncharacteristics noticed above. Dr. Richter says: \"This curious, if\r\nuninteresting painter, in all probability would never have emerged\r\nfrom his modest sphere of awkward provincialism into the full light of\r\nhistory but for the special praise bestowed upon him by his obliging\r\ncountryman, Vasari. The latter states definitely, among other things,\r\nthat Margaritone painted in the _maniera greca_; nevertheless, a single\r\nglance at the picture in the National Gallery is sufficient to convince\r\nthe beholder that in reality this is not the case. Margaritone's\r\npictures appear to me to be drawn in the wild and grotesque style\r\nprevalent in Italy during the early middle ages\" (_Lectures on the\r\nNational Gallery_, p. 11).\r\n\r\n[149] Dr. Richter ascribes all these pictures to the School of Duccio\r\n(see _Lectures on the National Gallery_, pp. 4-10.).\r\n\r\n[150] So described in the Official Catalogue. But \"is the female\r\nsaint on the right wing of the triptych really St. Catherine of\r\nAlexandria? Only the beginning of the inscription on either side of\r\nthe figure containing the name can here still be deciphered. It runs\r\nthus: SCA (Saint) AL. The reading 'Catherine' thus apparently becomes\r\ninadmissible. Besides, the emblems of this female saint are decidedly\r\nnot those of Catherine of Alexandria, who is always represented with a\r\nwheel as the emblem of her martyrdom, while the saint in the picture\r\nbefore us holds in her right hand a palm branch (?) and in her left a\r\nsmall cross, the emblem of confessors\" (Richter's _Italian Art in the\r\nNational Gallery_, p. 9).\r\n\r\n[151] This head is said to bear a marked resemblance to Mr. Swinburne\r\nas a young man (see W. B. Scott's _Autobiographical Notes_, ii. 18).\r\n\r\n[152] It was a practice at Italian weddings that the bride should be\r\npresented, as part of her dowry, with a coffer, which was intended\r\nto hold her trousseau and wedding presents. Some very fine specimens\r\nof these _cassoni_ may be seen in the South Kensington Museum. They\r\nbelong principally to the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. The typical\r\n_cassone_ measured about six feet in length by two in height and two in\r\nbreadth. The front and ends were decorated with paintings or carvings.\r\nThe subjects depicted are either marriage scenes or stories borrowed\r\nfrom the Scriptures, from the classics, or from Petrarch. Many of the\r\npanel pictures in the National Gallery once adorned these _cassoni_.\r\nSee, for instance, Nos. 1218 and 1219. A favourite subject was the\r\nallegory entitled \"The Triumph of Love, Chastity, and Death,\" of which\r\nan excellent example is at South Kensington. The panel in this Gallery,\r\nNo. 1196, has a similar subject.\r\n\r\n[153] This picture and the _tondo_ of the same subject (1033) are by\r\nmany critics ascribed to Botticelli. \"In my opinion,\" says Morelli,\r\n\"the two excellent but somewhat defaced pictures in the National\r\nGallery, 592 and 1033, are works not of Filippino, but of Botticelli,\r\nwhose dramatic powers are well displayed here\" (_Italian Masters in\r\nGerman Galleries_, p. 236). For a full discussion leading to the same\r\nconclusion, see Monkhouse's _In the National Gallery_, p. 73.\r\n\r\n[154] Miss Betham-Edwards, on a visit to the painter at By, was shown\r\nsome sketches for \"The Horse Fair.\" \"'There you have a Boulonnais,' I\r\nobserved, as we contemplated the study of a fine black cart-horse. This\r\nremark gratified her. 'I am glad to find a stranger so much interested\r\nin our cart-horses'\" (_Anglo-French Reminiscences_, ch. xxv.). Rosa\r\nBonheur's knowledge of the animal world of France was very wide and\r\nprecise.\r\n\r\n[155] This was Rosa Bonheur's own faith. \"I believe,\" she once said,\r\n\"in a just God, and a Paradise of the just. But religion (_i.e._ the\r\nreligion of Rome) does not altogether satisfy me. I hold it monstrous\r\nthat animals are supposed to be without souls. My poor lioness loved\r\nme. Thus she had more soul than certain human beings who do not know\r\nwhat it is to love anything.\"\r\n\r\n[156] \"Giulio Romano did a little of everything for the Dukes of\r\nMantua,--from painting the most delicate and improper little fresco\r\nfor a bedchamber, to restraining the Po and Mincio with immense dykes,\r\nrestoring ancient edifices and building new ones, draining swamps and\r\ndemolishing and reconstructing whole streets, painting palaces and\r\nchurches, and designing the city slaughter-house\" (W. D. Howells's\r\n_Italian Journeys_, \"Ducal Mantua\"). Giulio's departure from Rome to\r\nMantua was due to the scandal caused by the publication of some obscene\r\ndesigns of his (see _Symonds_, v. 341).\r\n\r\n[157] \"The piece of St. Catherine's dress over her shoulders is painted\r\non the under dress, after that was dry. All its value would have been\r\nlost, had the slightest tint or trace of it been given previously. This\r\npicture, I think, and certainly many of Tintoret's, are painted on dark\r\ngrounds; but this is to save time, and with some loss to the future\r\nbrightness of the colour\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. v. pt. viii. ch. iv.\r\n§ 17 _n._).\r\n\r\n[158] Robert Browning, however, notes \"the _bonne bourgeoisie_ of his\r\npictures; the dear common folk of his crowds, divinely pure they all\r\nare, but fresh from the streets and market-place\" (_Letters of Robert\r\nand E. B. Browning_, i. 197). Mr. Langton Douglas in an illustrated\r\nmonograph on _Fra Angelico_ (1900) lays stress on the painter's\r\n\"strength and freedom\" as shown in the \"Adoration of the Magi\" at San\r\nMarco, or the \"San Lorenzo giving alms\" in the studio of Pope Nicholas;\r\nillustrates the influence of contemporary architecture and sculpture on\r\nhis work; and characterises him not as \"a saint with a happy knack of\r\nillustration,\" but as \"an artist who happened to be a saint.\"\r\n\r\n[159] \"This,\" says Mr. Hipkins of the present picture, \"is the grandest\r\nand most extended mediæval band on record, worthy of the heavenly Host,\r\nto declare the praises of the Blessed Trinity.\" Mr. Hipkins gives an\r\ninteresting identification and description of the instruments employed.\r\nTo the left of the centre compartment we may find a viol, a rebec, a\r\nclarion, trumpets, harp, cither, double flute, and psaltery--also a\r\ntambourine, beaten with the hand, a tabor, and a portable organ. In\r\nthe centre, under Christ, are two organs. The player on the pipe and\r\ntabor, left of the Redeemer, blows what seems to be a short French\r\nwhistle. \"Next to this musician is a cymbal player. The time beater is\r\napparently no less required where time exists no more than he is in our\r\nterrestrial world; such discipline of rhythm is hereby sanctified.\" \"In\r\nthe upper rows, on the left hand of the Redeemer, we see one of those\r\nlarge guitar-viols which were used by the troubadours\" (see further\r\n_The Hobby Horse_, No. 1, 1893, pp. 14-16).\r\n\r\n[160] \"The many small figures which are seen here surrounded by a\r\ncelestial glory are so beautiful,\" says Vasari of this picture, \"that\r\nthey appear to be truly beings of paradise; nor can he who approaches\r\nthem be ever weary of regarding their beauty.\"\r\n\r\n[161] Now ascribed by many critics to Bouts (see 783).\r\n\r\n[162] Or more correctly, Piero dei' Franceschi, after the family name\r\nof his mother. Her Christian name was Romana, and Piero's father, it\r\nhas now been ascertained, continued living during many years of his\r\nson's career. The year of Piero's birth is unknown.\r\n\r\n[163] This is a more charitable judgment than contemporary documents\r\nwould suggest. In 1450 Fra Filippo was thrown into prison for a debt\r\nwhich he denied, and under torture confessed that he had forged the\r\nreceipt. He was deprived of his rectory, and appealed to the Pope, who,\r\nhowever, confirmed the sentence, in a brief in which the painter is\r\naccused of \"numerous and abominable wickednesses.\"\r\n\r\n[164] It is interesting to note the cartellino, or little card at the\r\nfoot of the picture, on which Antonello inscribes his name and the\r\ndate. This cartellino was taken as a model by Giovanni Bellini and\r\nsubsequent Venetian artists (see _e.g._ 189 and 280).\r\n\r\n[165] Comparing him with Italian painters, his period of activity is\r\nseen to be coincident with the earlier work of Carpaccio and Perugino;\r\nhe died while Raphael was still a boy. Crowe and Cavalcaselle have\r\nshown that Memlinc's work was well known and appreciated among Italian\r\nconnoisseurs of the time.\r\n\r\n[166] I venture to retain this title, though the Official Catalogue\r\nassures us that it is but \"a pleasing illusion,\" as \"the features and\r\nthe general form of head have little or no resemblance to the quite\r\nauthentic portraits of Andrea\" at Florence, \"or to that engraved by\r\nVasari, who was personally acquainted with the painter. If (adds the\r\ncatalogue) the object in the hands represents, as it well may, a\r\npiece of modelling-clay, the subject of the portrait was probably a\r\nFlorentine sculptor.\" In that case we may perhaps save our \"pleasing\r\nillusion\" by supposing that Andrea interpreted the expression of a\r\nfellow-artist by his own experience. But the case is by no means clear.\r\nThe earlier portrait in the Uffizi is not very unlike ours. In the\r\nlater some resemblance remains, though the face has coarsened. But this\r\nis a matter on which every one must see resemblances or otherwise for\r\nhimself. (Reproductions will be found in the monograph on the painter\r\nin the \"Great Masters\" series. The author, H. Guinness, considers the\r\nauthenticity of our portrait to be \"beyond question,\" p. 23).\r\n\r\n[167] Lucrezia's character has, however, been whitewashed of late\r\nyears: see _Gazette des Beaux Arts_, December 1876 and three following\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[168] This delightful picture, which has hitherto been ascribed to\r\nBellini himself, is now (1898) attributed in the official catalogue to\r\nCatena (see 234).\r\n\r\n[169] \"The pet portrait of the lecturer was Moroni's 'Tailor.' Luckily\r\nthe original painting was in the National Gallery, and all interested\r\ncould judge for themselves whether, for simplicity, expression,\r\ndrawing, colour, and above all, soul, the portrait had a rival\" (Report\r\nof a lecture on \"Portraiture\" by Mr. Harry Furniss).\r\n\r\n[170] In a red-figured vase in the British Museum (E 477 in the Third\r\nVase Room) there is a picture of this same subject. \"The drawing,\"\r\nsays Miss Harrison, \"is somewhat coarse, and the painter seems to\r\nbe struggling with a subject that is expressively too much for him.\r\nProcris sinks in death in an odd, ill-drawn attitude; her soul escapes\r\nin the form of a bird, Kephalos smites his head in despair, the dog\r\nLailaps watches concerned. Erechtheus, the old king-father, is at hand\r\nto sympathise; the curt archaic symbolism of attitude, the utterance\r\nof mere gesture, is at fault here. The story was pregnant with modern\r\nsuggestion. It had to wait, so to speak, for the delicate imagination\r\nof the Renaissance painter, Piero di Cosimo, to make us feel the\r\ncontrast between the dead woman, over-sentient, passion-slain, and the\r\nshaggy faun, kindly perplexed, and the dumb, faithful dog; between the\r\nsoft slack peace of the woodland and the terrible tension of humanity\"\r\n(_Magazine of Art_, 1894, p. 61).\r\n\r\n[171] Formerly ascribed to Margaret van Eyck.\r\n\r\n[172] Formerly ascribed to Van der Goes.\r\n\r\n[173]\r\n\r\n    The clouds that gather round the setting sun\r\n    Do take a sober colouring from an eye\r\n    That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality.\r\n\r\n  WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[174] The existence of this supposed younger Foppa, and the date\r\n1492 (rather than 1502) must be considered doubtful in view of the\r\nresearches published by C. J. Ffoulkes in the _Athenæum_, February 15,\r\n1902.\r\n\r\n[175] \"Velazquez has left a great number of striking pictures, each\r\ncontaining a single figure. The Count de Pourtalès, in the collection\r\nat Paris (from which this picture was bought in 1865), has an\r\nexcellent specimen of one of these studies, called 'The Dead Orlando'\"\r\n(Stirling's _Annals of the Artists of Spain_, 1848, p. 680). Other\r\nauthorities ascribe the picture to Valdes Leal (see 1291).\r\n\r\n[176] Among other points we may notice the beautiful landscape;\r\n\"Nothing can be more perfect in pictorial effect than the old wall, the\r\ndistant roofs, the gleams of light on water, and the exquisite tones of\r\ngray\" (Gilbert's _Landscape in Art_, p. 263).\r\n\r\n[177] It may be interesting to note what Raphael's method actually was.\r\nHe writes to Count Baldassare Castiglione, in a complimentary way:\r\n\"To paint a beautiful woman, I must see several, with this condition,\r\nthat your lordship be near me to select the loveliest. But there being\r\na dearth both of good judges and of beautiful women, I make use of a\r\ncertain idea that comes into my mind. Whether with benefit to art, I\r\nknow not; but I strive to form such an ideal in my mind.\"\r\n\r\n[178] Readers of Ruskin will remember the high praise accorded to\r\nRichter's illustrations of the Lord's Prayer and other engravings in\r\n_The Elements of Drawing_.\r\n\r\n[179] See their _Vittore Carpaccio et la Confrérie de Sainte Ursule_,\r\npp. 9-10, and _Vittore Carpaccio, Le Vite e le Opere_.\r\n\r\n[180] Raphael was born in 1483. In 1491 his mother died.\r\n\r\n[181] \"Pisano's dragon is a pleasant-looking animal, wild-boar faced,\r\nand smilingly showing his fangs, as he crouches by the eminently\r\ngentlemanly St. George in the silver-plated and gilt armour; and a\r\nword in passing must be said for the lovely hog, with a broad grin\r\noverspreading his countenance, who accompanies the placid St. Anthony.\r\nIs not St. George, in the broad Tuscan hat, the personification of John\r\nInglesant as _il Cavaliere di San Giorgio_?\" (S. Beale in _Good Words_,\r\nJuly 1895).\r\n\r\n[182] \"A splendid example of the naïve humour of the painter. There\r\nis the father, somewhat sly, and the eldest son resembling him but\r\nless 'cute. The next head is that of a jolly, sandy-haired fellow.\r\nThen comes the reprobate, with a sensual upper lip, the only one\r\nin the family; all the others have thin, long slit mouths, as well\r\nas long straight noses. Behind, are the poor relations. We see the\r\ngood, hard-working cousin, who has found life too much for him; the\r\nself-approving fellow, who thanks God he is not as other men are;\r\nand above him the man who, if he has been saved from committing some\r\nterrible crime, certainly owes his exemption to God's mercy, not, we\r\nmay be sure, to his own strength of will. On the other side are the\r\nladies of the family. The severe mamma, with flat brow, a veritable\r\nMrs. Grundy. The daughter, evidently a worldling by the jewelled band\r\nround her forehead, is praying, because it is the business of the\r\nmoment. The easy-going maiden above her has taken to religious life\r\nbecause it affords her a certain amount of distinction, with a little\r\nsoul-saving. Behind, is the old great-aunt, a really pious soul, who\r\nhas adopted conventual life from a devout conviction that she could\r\nlive better and do more good as a member of a community than dwelling\r\nin the world. Above, are two fat-faced children, both more or less\r\nbored; and behind them is another, fascinated by the jewels of her\r\nkinswomen\" (S. Beale in _Good Words_, July 1895).\r\n\r\n[183] See Richter's _Italian Art in the National Gallery_, p. 44,\r\nwhere a résumé of recent criticism and a facsimile of the Albertina\r\ndrawing will be found. Signor Frizzoni, cited with approval by\r\nRichter, says: \"Although the composition seems to me not in the\r\nleast attractive, nor even successful (and for this very reason the\r\npicture might have been left unfinished), yet I cannot but consider\r\nit to be an original, and, moreover, a specially interesting one,\r\nand worthy of being looked at closely by those who wish to study\r\nthe master in the numerous characteristic features of his style.\r\nIn my opinion it is an early work by him; and this becomes evident\r\nespecially from the purity and delicacy in the features of one of the\r\nMaries, standing on the right side, in which, if I am not mistaken,\r\nthe pure types of his first master, Domenico Ghirlandaio, are much\r\nmore perceptible than Buonarroti's own grand style. In other parts,\r\nhowever, the sculpturesque manner of modelling peculiar to him is\r\nnot less noticeable--in the muscles, sturdy as usual, and in the\r\nprominent rendering of the corpse.\" Symonds, on the other hand, has\r\nno hesitation in rejecting the picture. \"It is,\" he says, \"painful to\r\nbelieve that at any period of his life Michelangelo could have produced\r\na composition so discordant, so unsatisfactory in some anatomical\r\ndetails, so feelingless and ugly. It bears indubitable traces of his\r\ninfluence; that is apparent in the figure of the dead Christ. But this\r\ncolossal nude, with the massive chest and attenuated legs, reminds us\r\nof his manner in old age; whereas the rest of the picture shows no\r\ntrace of that manner. I am inclined to think that the Entombment was\r\nthe production of a second-rate craftsman, working upon some design\r\nmade by Michelangelo at the advanced period when the Passion of our\r\nLord occupied his thoughts in Rome. Even so, the spirit of the drawing\r\nmust have been imperfectly assimilated; and, what is more puzzling, the\r\ncomposition does not recall the style of Michelangelo's old age. The\r\ncolouring, so far as we can understand it, rather suggests Pontormo\"\r\n(_The Life of Michelangelo_, 1893, i. 68). Sir Edward Poynter, on the\r\nother hand, will hear of no doubt: \"There is,\" he says, \"no doubt\r\nwhatever that this picture is the work of the great master. The\r\noriginality of the composition, the magnificent dignity of the poses,\r\nthe perfection of the modelling, combined with the profound knowledge\r\nand subtle play of the anatomical forms where the work is complete,\r\nand the exquisite beauty of the drapery, all stamp it as a work which,\r\nif completed, would have been one of the masterpieces of the world,\r\nand possible to no one but the great master of design. It is thought\r\ndesirable to insist on the grand qualities of this picture, because it\r\nhas been ascribed to Bandinelli, a bombastic sculptor, quite incapable\r\neither of the refinement or of the subtle feeling for nature which\r\nis evident in all the finished portions of this work\" (_The National\r\nGallery_, i. 72).\r\n\r\n[184] According to one of the dramatic critics in the daily press, Sir\r\nHenry Irving in playing _Richelieu_ was made up to resemble closely\r\nthis picture; and (added the critic) the actor brought out the three\r\nsides of Richelieu's character here depicted. \"At times we see him as\r\nthe pitiless, unscrupulous man who forced himself from obscurity to a\r\npower greater than his monarch's; at others we see the fine courteous\r\ngentleman who patronised literature, founded the French Academy, and\r\ncollaborated in half a dozen bad plays; and there is also not a little\r\nof the paltry, small-minded tyrant of whom Corneille said--\r\n\r\n    Il m'a trop fait de bien pour en dire du mal.\r\n    Il m'a trop fait de mal pour en dire du bien.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[185] See Morelli's _German Galleries_, p. 393. He dismisses the idea\r\nof an original Vicentine School as one which \"cannot be entertained at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n[186] \"By Gentile Bellini, and not by Giovanni, as stated in the\r\nCatalogue. The latter artist drew the ear of a different shape than did\r\nhis brother Gentile\" (Morelli: _German Galleries_, p. 10 _n._). If by\r\nGentile, the signature is forged or altered.\r\n\r\n[187] \"I subjoin,\" writes the poet to his mother (December 23, 1880),\r\n\"a sonnet I have done on the Michelangelo in the National Gallery. In\r\nthis picture the Virgin is withdrawing from the child the book which\r\ncontains the prophecy of his sufferings--I suppose that of Isaiah. The\r\nidea is a most beautiful one; and behind the group are angels perusing\r\na scroll. Shields was helpful to me in the interpretation of this\"\r\n(_Letters and Memoir_, ii. 365).\r\n\r\n[188] Signed Joannes Bellini, but by some critics ascribed to Gentile\r\nBellini. See Frizzoni's _Arte Italiana del Rinascimento_, p. 314.\r\n\r\n[189] To the same effect, Sir Edward Poynter: \"The painting of the\r\ngreen forest is the most perfectly beautiful piece of workmanship that\r\never was put into a picture\" (_Lectures on Art_, p. 128).\r\n\r\n[190] But see note on No. 53.\r\n\r\n[191] \"Unfortunately, Hobbema has allowed some one, apparently\r\nWyntrank, to put a few ducks into the foreground. They are not wanted,\r\nand the manipulation required to fit them in has caused the lower\r\npart of the picture to darken disagreeably\" (Armstrong: _Notes on the\r\nNational Gallery_, p. 38).\r\n\r\n[192] Ruskin speaks of him as an artist \"first-rate in an inferior\r\nline\" (_On the Old Road_, i. 558).\r\n\r\n[193] Some of Mr. Gladstone's purchases for the National Gallery are\r\nnoticed in the introduction to Appendix II. The \"Ansidei Madonna\" was\r\nalso purchased by a special vote when he was in power. The Gallery owes\r\nthe present picture to Mr. Disraeli's taste. \"I happened,\" says Sir\r\nWilliam Fraser in his _Disraeli and his Day_, \"to be at the saleroom\r\nin King Street: the crowd was considerable. A picture was on the easel\r\nfor sale; I did not know the name of the painter: the subject, 'The\r\nNativity,' of the pre-Raphaelite school. I was so charmed with it that\r\nI bid up to two thousand pounds. I then felt that I could not trust my\r\njudgment further: that I might be mistaken: and that the picture might\r\nbe 'run up' for trade purposes. It was bought for £2415. A few days\r\nafterwards I met Mr. C. Having noticed him in the crowd, I said, 'Do\r\nyou happen to know who bought that \"Francesca\"?' 'I did. Disraeli told\r\nme to buy it for the National Gallery.'\"\r\n\r\n[194] The fondness of the Old Masters for the brute creation is\r\nillustrated in this picture, as in so many others. The ox is evidently\r\nfascinated by the music; the ass is disturbed and brays fiercely. Note\r\nalso the goldfinch upon the roof.\r\n\r\n[195] \"The painter must, for the present, remain as an unknown Umbrian,\r\nalmost equally influenced by Pinturicchio and Signorelli, and with\r\npeculiar qualities of simple grace and romance, which give his work an\r\nextremely individual character\" (Cruttwell's _Signorelli_, p. 117).\r\n\r\n[196] English readers will find some account, with occasional\r\ntranslations, of Poliziano's poem in Symonds's _Sketches and Studies in\r\nItaly and Greece_, ii. 334, and _Renaissance_, iv. 350. Symonds, had\r\nalready remarked that much of the poem is like a picture of Botticelli.\r\nThe same painter's \"Birth of Venus\" may have been suggested by stanza\r\n99 of Poliziano, though the peculiar sentiment of that famous picture\r\nis the painter's own. See also under 916.\r\n\r\n[197] \"We venture to ask,\" says Dr. Richter, \"is this really an Italian\r\npicture?\" (_Italian Art in the National Gallery_, p. 87).\r\n\r\n[198] The figures are by Tiepolo (see under 1192).\r\n\r\n[199] Visitors who have been to Venice will remember that \"Carpaccio\r\ntrusts for the chief splendour of any _festa_ in cities to the patterns\r\nof the draperies hung out of windows\" (_Bible of Amiens_, p. 3).\r\n\r\n[200] Or, according to Mr. Berenson, of Alvise Vivarini and Lotto (see\r\nhis _Lorenzo Lotto_, pp. 113, 304).\r\n\r\n[201] It was exhibited at the \"Old Masters\" exhibition in 1873 as a\r\nRaphael. Mr. Ruskin, who had noticed it there, wrote to Mr. Fairfax\r\nMurray, \"Please look at the Raphael, and tell me how far the colour may\r\nhave changed on St. John's shoulder and in Judas' dress, and how far\r\nthe fantastic shot silks of this last are absolutely as they were.\"\r\n\r\n[202] It is a repetition with but slight variations of the Medici\r\npicture in the Uffizi.\r\n\r\n[203] \"The early Italian masters felt themselves so indebted to, and\r\nformed by, the master-craftsman who had mainly disciplined their\r\nfingers, whether in work on gold or marble, that they practically\r\nconsidered him their father, and took _his_ name rather than their\r\nown; so that most of the great Italian workmen are now known, not by\r\ntheir own names, but by those of their masters (or of their native\r\ntowns or villages--these being recognised as masters also), the master\r\nbeing himself often entirely forgotten by the public, and eclipsed by\r\nhis pupil; but immortal _in_ his pupil, and named in his name.... All\r\nwhich I beg you to take to heart and meditate on concerning Mastership\r\nand Pupilage\" (_Fors Clavigera_, 1872, xxii. 3, 4). Vasari's story may\r\nbe true, says Dr. Richter, \"even though no contemporary record of a\r\ngoldsmith called Botticello has been found. We know, however, that he\r\nhad a brother, Giovanni Battista, a carpenter and frame-maker of some\r\nrepute, nicknamed _Botticegli_, _i.e._ 'Little Barrel'; this nickname\r\nmay have been inherited by the younger brother\" (_Lectures on the\r\nNational Gallery_, p. 48).\r\n\r\n[204] See Richter's _Lectures on the National Gallery_ for the list, p.\r\n46.\r\n\r\n[205] Reference may be made also to Mr. Swinburne's \"Notes on Designs\r\nof the Old Masters at Florence\" (first published in the _Fortnightly\r\nReview_ for July 1868), in which he speaks of \"the faint and almost\r\npainful grace which gives a distinct value and curious charm to all\r\nthe works of Botticelli.\" At an auction in 1867 D. G. Rossetti picked\r\nup a Botticelli for £20. \"If he had not something to do,\" writes his\r\nbrother, \"with the vogue which soon afterwards began to attach to that\r\nfascinating master, I am under a misapprehension.\" Pater's essay first\r\nappeared in the _Fortnightly Review_ of August 1870. Ruskin's first\r\nmention of Botticelli was in a lecture delivered at Oxford during the\r\nLent Term, 1871. Carpaccio had been proclaimed in a lecture of the\r\npreceding year, and it became a standing joke among the profane to ask\r\nwho was Ruskin's last \"greatest painter.\" It was in answer thereto that\r\nMr. Bourdillon wrote:\r\n\r\n    To us this star or that seems bright,\r\n    And oft some headlong meteor's flight\r\n    Holds for awhile our raptured sight.\r\n    But he discerns each noble star;\r\n    The least is only the most far,\r\n    Whose worlds, may be, the mightiest are.\r\n\r\n\r\n[206] \"The dress appears to have been originally crimson or pink. If\r\nso, it has faded to so agreeable a tone that one could hardly wish it\r\notherwise\" (Poynter).\r\n\r\n[207] The visitor should contrast Canaletto's painting of still water\r\nwith Turner's (see under 535).\r\n\r\n[208] \"Upon asking how he had been taught the art of a _cognoscento_\r\nso very suddenly, he assured me that nothing was more easy. The whole\r\nsecret consisted in a strict adherence to two rules: the one, always\r\nto observe that the picture might have been better if the painter had\r\ntaken more pains; and the other to praise the works of Pietro Perugino\"\r\n(_Vicar of Wakefield_, ch. xx.).\r\n\r\n[209] The author of the catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club's\r\nExhibition of 1898 maintains that the two side panels are later in date\r\nthan the central panel, and have no connection with it (p. xxxvii.).\r\n\r\n[210] Sir Walter Armstrong attributes No. 1079 to David. \"The National\r\nGallery possesses one of the best of David's authenticated works\r\n(1045), and a comparison between it and the \"Adoration of the Magi,\"\r\nnumbered 1079, goes far to prove them to be by one hand. Compare, for\r\ninstance, the figure of the beggar in the one picture with that of St.\r\nJoseph in shadow behind the Virgin, in the other. And the evidence of\r\nstyle is confirmed by a curious discovery that I happened to make one\r\nbright day, when the glass was off the latter picture. Low down in the\r\nleft-hand corner the word OUVVATER is written in a way that precludes\r\nthe notion of forgery, for it has been scratched with, perhaps, the\r\nbutt end of a brush, while the paint was still wet, so that the red\r\nunder-painting shows through the letters. David was born at Ouwater, or\r\nOudewater, about 1450, and did not migrate to Bruges till 1484\" (_Notes\r\non the National Gallery_, p. 29).\r\n\r\n[211] See Morley's _Diderot_, ii. 62. \"Yet he cannot refuse to concede\r\nabout one of Boucher's pictures that after all he would be glad to\r\npossess it. Every time you saw it, he says, you would find fault\r\nwith it, yet you would go on looking at it. This is perhaps what the\r\nseverest modern amateur, as he strolls carelessly through the French\r\nschool at his leisure, would not in his heart care to deny.\"\r\n\r\n[212] Ruskin speaks under the head of typical beauty (of beauty, that\r\nis, as typical of divine attributes) of the absolute necessity in\r\npictures for some suggestion of infinity. \"Escape, Hope, Infinity, by\r\nwhatever conventionalism sought, the device is the same in all, the\r\ninstinct constant\" (_Modern Painters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. i. ch. v.\r\n§§ 7, 8).\r\n\r\n[213] Ruskin finds Leonardo's landscape unconvincing. \"In realisation\r\nof detail he verges on the ornamental; in his rock outlines he has all\r\nthe deficiencies and little of the feeling of the earlier men. The\r\nrocks are grotesque without being ideal, and extraordinary without\r\nbeing impressive.\" \"The forms of rock in Leonardo's celebrated 'Vierge\r\naux Rochers' are literally no better than those on a china plate\"\r\n(_Modern Painters_, vol. i. pt. ii. sec. i. ch. vii. § 13; Edinburgh\r\n_Lectures on Architecture and Painting_, p. 157). A high authority\r\non the Alpine region, Mr. Douglas Freshfield, has suggested that the\r\noriginals of Leonardo's backgrounds are to be found among the mountains\r\nbetween Val Sassina and the Lago di Lecco: \"The last spurs of the Alps\r\nare here singularly picturesque. The bold forms of the Corno di Canzo\r\nand Monte Baro break down to display the shining pools of the Laghi\r\ndi Pusiano and d' Annone. Hither Leonardo may have come, and looking\r\nacross the narrow lake or from beside some smaller pool or stream at\r\nthe stiff upright rocks of the Grigna and the Resegone, have conceived\r\nthe strange backgrounds with which we are all familiar\" (_Italian\r\nAlps_, 1875, p. 126). Mr. Freshfield's suggestion is borne out by\r\nLeonardo's own topographical notes, since published. He had visited the\r\ndistrict and specially remarks upon its fantastic rocks.\r\n\r\n[214] When in the Hamilton Collection, this picture was ascribed to\r\nGiorgione. Some critics strongly dispute the ascription (see, _e.g._,\r\nRichter's _Italian Art in the National Gallery_, p. 87), others accept\r\nit (see, _e.g._, an article in the _Times_, July 26, 1882). Sir\r\nEdward Poynter says: \"The qualities of colour and painting in this\r\npicture so closely resemble those of the famous 'Fête Champêtre' by\r\nGiorgione in the Louvre, that it is difficult not to believe that the\r\ntwo pictures are by the same hand, and that, if the Louvre picture is\r\nrightly named, the original attribution to Giorgione may be correct\"\r\n(_National Gallery_, i. 24). Mr. Herbert Cook is of the same opinion:\r\n\"The figures, with their compactly built and rounded limbs, are such as\r\nGiorgione loved to model, the sweep of draperies and the splendid line\r\nindicate a consummate master, the idyllic landscape is just such as we\r\nsee in the Louvre picture and elsewhere, the glow and splendour of the\r\nwhole reveal a master of tone and colouring\" (_Giorgione_, p. 94). As\r\nan illustration of the uncertainty of criticism it may be interesting\r\nto append the observations on Sir E. Poynter's remarks made by a writer\r\nin the _Daily Telegraph_ of Dec. 29, 1899: \"In reality no two works\r\nbelonging to more or less the same period of Venetian art could be\r\nmore utterly different. The Hamilton Palace picture is a soulless and\r\nsecond-rate production, dating a good many years later than the Louvre\r\nidyll, wholly different from it in handling, and remarkable only for\r\nits beautiful golden tone. The Louvre 'Fête Champêtre'--a late example\r\nof the divine master--is one of the loveliest and most characteristic\r\npieces produced in the early prime of Venetian painting. Should the\r\n'Venus and Adonis' be set down to Giorgione, the misrepresentation in\r\nthe National Gallery of a unique figure in art would be complete.\"\r\n\r\n[215] By Mr. Berenson to \"Amico di Sandro.\"\r\n\r\n[216] \"The figures are ill-proportioned and want expression and\r\ncharacter. They are more probably by a scholar or imitator\" (Layard's\r\n_Kugler_, vol. i. p. 289).\r\n\r\n[217] Critics of the modern school assert that the picture was not\r\nexecuted by Botticelli, even if it was designed by him; it bears,\r\nthey say, \"no trace of his style\" (see, _e.g._, Richter's _Lectures_\r\nand Frizzoni's _Arte Italiana del Rinascimento_). Ruskin was on the\r\nsame side: \"I hope you know Botticelli well enough,\" he wrote to Mr.\r\nFairfax Murray (February 14, 1873), \"not to think you'll have to copy\r\nstuff like that arms-akimbo thing. By the way, what have they all got,\r\nlike truncheons? They look like a lot of opera-directors.\" Dr. Uhlmann\r\nin his work on Botticelli ascribes the picture to Botticini; Vasari,\r\nhe thinks, confused the two painters,--a theory for which there is\r\nno sort of proof. There is only one work of Botticini which has been\r\nidentified with certainty. It is at Empoli, and was executed in 1490,\r\nor fifteen years at least before this picture. Vasari's account is\r\nprecise, and is confirmed, as we have seen, by historical records. Very\r\nconvincing internal proofs are necessary to overthrow this external\r\nevidence. Where are such proofs? The idea of the picture is entirely\r\nin accordance with what we know of Botticelli. \"The wonderful energy\r\nof the angels and the boldness of the design attest his invention\"\r\n(Monkhouse's _In the National Gallery_, p. 64). The case in this sense\r\nis very well put by Mr. Maurice Hewlett in the _Academy_ of January 9,\r\n1892. He points out among other things that the picture agrees with the\r\ngeneral spirit of Botticelli's designs for the \"Paradiso.\"\r\n\r\n[218] Some account of the poem is given in an appendix to vol. v. of\r\nSymonds's _Renaissance in Italy_.\r\n\r\n[219] The traveller will find a convenient handbook to these frescoes\r\nin Mr. J. L. Bevir's _Visitor's Guide to Orvieto_.\r\n\r\n[220] It came from the Hamilton sale (1882), and was bought for the\r\nsmall price of £157:10s.\r\n\r\n[221] Owing to the similarity of initials IVO the picture was ascribed\r\nby its former owner to Isaac van Ostade, who, however, died in 1649.\r\n\r\n[222] Materials for such comparison--which is not the least interesting\r\nof the many lines of study offered by a collection of pictures--are\r\nprovided in Mrs. Jameson's books, or may be formed still better by\r\nevery student for himself by a collection of photographs. A capital\r\nseries of articles by Mr. Grant Allen in the _Pall Mall Magazine_ of\r\n1895 traced, in a few of the most popular subjects, the process of\r\n\"Evolution in Early Italian Art.\"\r\n\r\n[223] Visitors to Venice will remember a beautiful use of this\r\narrangement on the southern side of the Rialto, the Dove forming the\r\nkeystone of the arch.\r\n\r\n[224] A piece of paper of the last century, glued to the back of this\r\npanel, contains a memorandum in now faded ink, in the handwriting of\r\nthe great-grandfather of Signor G. Molfini (from whom the picture\r\nwas bought in Genoa in 1883), to the following effect:--\"Antonello\r\nof Messina, a city of Sicily, a famous painter.... And this is his\r\nportrait, painted by himself, as was to be seen by an inscription below\r\nit which I, in order to reduce it (_i.e._ the picture) to a better\r\nshape, sawed away.\" Some traces of further writing are now illegible.\r\n\r\n[225] Ford Madox Brown, who was not one to be impressed by any\r\nauthority, has some very scathing remarks on this picture: \"Bad in\r\ncolour, in drawing, in grouping, and in expression, with the figure of\r\nJesus falling on its nose, this work seems to shine solely by reason of\r\nthe varnish with which it has recently been so polished up\" (_Magazine\r\nof Art_, 1890, p. 135).\r\n\r\n[226] He enumerates them in an official return of his property:\r\n\"Further, I have a monkey, moreover, a raven which can talk, and which\r\nI keep by me in order that he may teach from his cage a theological\r\njackass also to speak. Item: an owl to frighten the witches, two\r\npeacocks, two dogs, a sparrow-hawk, and other birds of prey, six fowls,\r\neighteen chickens, two moor-fowl, and many other birds, to name all of\r\nwhich would only cause confusion.\"\r\n\r\n[227] According to Nonius Marcellus: \"By old Roman law, brides used to\r\nbring three _asses_ (pennies), and to give one, which they held in the\r\nhand, to the bridegroom, as though to purchase him; to place another,\r\nwhich they held in the foot, on the hearth of the family Lares; and to\r\nput the third in their pocket and rattle it at the next cross-road.\"\r\n\r\n[228] See, however, for some deductions afterwards made from this\r\nestimate, _ibid._ vol. iv. pt. v. ch. iii. §§ 6, 7.\r\n\r\n[229] Elsewhere Ruskin makes some exception in favour of Ary Scheffer:\r\n\"Though one of the heads of the Mud sentiment school, he does\r\n_draw_ and _feel_ very beautifully and deeply\" (_Letters on Art and\r\nLiterature_, p. 37).\r\n\r\n[230] It was placed in their chapel in the church of S. Lorenzo in that\r\ncity. There it remained till 1764, when it was bought for the Duke of\r\nMarlborough, and a copy replaced the original in the chapel.\r\n\r\n[231] This picture and Van Dyck's \"Charles the First\" (1172) were\r\nbought in 1884 from the Duke of Marlborough for £87,500. Sir F. Burton,\r\nthe Director of the National Gallery, had valued them at £115,500 and\r\n£31,500 severally. I remember once hearing Mr. Gladstone refer to this\r\nmatter. His economic conscience seemed to give him some qualms on the\r\nscore of the unprecedented price. But he took comfort in the fact\r\nthat, large as was the price actually paid, the price asked by the\r\nowner, as also the valuation of the Director, was very much larger.\r\n\"At any rate,\" he said with a smile, \"I saved the taxpayers £45,000\r\non this Raphael, by not listening to the advice of the Director of\r\nthe Gallery.\" The purchase had been pressed upon the Government by\r\nall sorts and conditions of men. The Royal Academy memorialised Mr.\r\nGladstone, and pleaded especially for the Raphael--\"a work produced in\r\nthat happy period in which the reverent purity and the serene grace\r\nof the master's earliest work are already mellowing into the fuller\r\ndignity of his middle style.\" The Trustees of the National Gallery\r\ndeclared that the purchase would at once raise the Collection to a\r\nrank second to none, and superior to most, of the great Continental\r\nGalleries; whilst a memorial from members of Parliament of all parties,\r\nafter referring to the Raphael as the finest in point of colouring\r\nthat ever came from his hand, assured Mr. Gladstone that \"their\r\nconstituents and the whole nation will approve and applaud\" a departure\r\nfrom \"the hard line of severe economy.\" It appears from _The Life and\r\nCorrespondence of Mr. Childers_ (ii. 163), who was Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer at the time, that the purchase was first suggested by Queen\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\n[232] Sir Edward Poynter. The luminous quality of the picture conquered\r\nMr. Ruskin. After one of his last visits to the National Gallery, he\r\nsaid to me: \"The new Raphael is certainly lovely--quite the loveliest\r\nRaphael in the world. The 'San Sisto' is dark and brown beside it.\"\r\n\r\n[233] In this matter of the open sky also the \"Ansidei Madonna\" is\r\ncuriously transitional. \"Raphael,\" says Ruskin (_ibid._ § 10), \"in\r\nhis fall, betrayed the faith he had received from his father and\r\nhis master, and substituted for the radiant sky of the Madonna del\r\nCardellino, the chamber-wall of the Madonna della Sediola, and the\r\nbrown wainscot of the Baldacchino.\" Here we have both--the Baldacchino\r\nand the open sky behind.\r\n\r\n[234] Mr. Monkhouse suggests alternative explanations. Who is the\r\nfigure on the throne? \"Is he meant for some intellectual Dives,\r\nlearning too late that happiness exists not in luxury or knowledge? Is\r\nhe the poet, musing in sadness and mental solitude on the mysteries of\r\nlife, who cannot taste of its fruit or listen to its music, unconscious\r\nof the brute forces symbolised by the panther, and the vanity of human\r\npride imaged by the peacock on the dead branch; or is he a philosopher\r\nimparting wisdom to the young? What matter, the picture charms like\r\nnature, because we cannot fathom it\" (_In the National Gallery_, p.\r\n234). In the case of Giorgione's frescoes at Venice, Vasari frankly\r\n\"gave it up\": \"I, for my part, have never been able to understand what\r\nthey mean, nor, with all the inquiries that I have made, could I ever\r\nfind any one who did understand, or could explain them to me.\" But the\r\ntheory that the subject in Renaissance pictures meant nothing--that\r\ndetails were treated from a purely pictorial point of view--is, as Dr.\r\nRichter has well observed, more convenient than correct. The clue to\r\nmany of these unknown subjects is to be found in classical or Italian\r\nliterature. Bellini's allegorical compositions have recently been thus\r\ninterpreted. Titian's so-called \"Sacred and Profane Love\" has been\r\nidentified by Herr Franz Wickhoff as an illustration of the story of\r\nMedea as told in the seventh book of the _Argonautica_ of Valerius\r\nFlaccus, and the same author has also found the key to several works\r\nascribed to Giorgione.\r\n\r\n[235] Dr. Richter, who found these pictures in a Veronese palace,\r\npoints out that the architecture in the background represents the old\r\ntower of the castle of Mantua (_Art Journal_, Feb. 1895). It has,\r\nhowever, been urged amongst other objections that the eagle on the\r\nbanners belongs to neither of the two houses. Perhaps, therefore, the\r\nsubject of the pictures is purely imaginary or borrowed from some\r\nromance of the time.\r\n\r\n[236] See note on No. 591.\r\n\r\n[237] One portrait, however, was found by Mr. Petrie, not fixed over\r\nthe face of the mummy, but framed and glazed for hanging on the wall\r\nof a tomb. The frame, now in the British Museum, is very like what is\r\ncalled an \"Oxford frame.\"\r\n\r\n[238] Two other members of the family are known as painters--Ambrosius,\r\nbrother of the younger Hans; and Sigmund, brother of the elder. A\r\nportrait ascribed to the latter is in our Gallery, No. 722.\r\n\r\n[239] The picture is painted on ten boards joined vertically; and it is\r\ninteresting to speculate how far the composition may have been directed\r\nby the necessity of avoiding any joint in the faces.\r\n\r\n[240] _Cf._ what Ruskin says of \"the glorious severity\" of Holbein's\r\nportraits (_Modern Painters_, vol. ii. pt. iii. sec. 1. ch. xiv. § 19).\r\n\r\n[241] The contrast between the picture as it was before being cleaned\r\nand as it is now is very great. The accessories have come out in\r\nastonishing clearness, and the crucifix in the left-hand corner has\r\nbeen unveiled. The dingy green of the curtain background has given\r\nplace to a rich damask, and the gown of the younger man--which Wornum\r\ndescribed as \"brownish green\"--is now seen to be not green at all. Mr.\r\nDyer, to whose art this successful restoration was due, removed the\r\nobscuring dirt and varnish entirely by manual friction.\r\n\r\n[242] Several pages would be required to give a _résumé_ of all the\r\ntheories propounded, and of all the _pros_ and _cons_ in each case.\r\nAn account of the principal theories was given in the fourth edition\r\nof this Handbook, and the story forms an entertaining chapter in\r\nthe curiosities of criticism. The most elaborately sustained of the\r\ntheories is that which identifies the \"ambassadors\" with the Counts\r\nPalatine Otto Henry and his brother Philip (see the monograph on the\r\npicture by W. F. Dickes).\r\n\r\n[243] The following is the text of the document:--\r\n\r\n      Remarques sur le suject d'un tableau excellent des Srs.\r\n      d'Inteville Polizy, et de George de Selve.[244]\r\n\r\n      En ce tableau est representé au naturel Messire Jean de D\r\n      Intevile chevalier sieur de Polizy près de Bar-sur-seyne Bailly\r\n      de Troyes, qui fut Ambassadeur en Angleterre pour le Roy\r\n      François premier ez années 1532 & 1533 & de puis Gouverneur\r\n      de Monsieur Charles de France second filz diceluy Roy, le\r\n      quel Charles mourut a forest monstier en l'an 1545, & le dict\r\n      sr. de D Intevile en l'an 1555, sepulturé en l'eglise du dict\r\n      Polizy.

But it is evident that the hymn or anthem\r\nabove mentioned is merely a paraphrase of the well-known 'Veni Sancte\r\nSpiritus,' which for ages past has appeared in the Roman Catholic\r\nbreviary for use on Whit Sunday or the Feast of Pentecost, and still\r\nsurvives in the Anglican Ordination Service.\" The music in the book\r\nhas been identified by Mr. W. B. Squire, of the British Museum, as the\r\ncounterpoint sung by the tenor in Johann Walther's setting for the\r\nWittenberg hymn-book of 1524. Mr. Squire adds his opinion that Holbein\r\nchose those compositions for copying in the picture, \"on account of\r\nthe bearing which the words had upon either the individuals portrayed,\r\nor some incident connected with them, and intended to be commemorated\"\r\n(Letter to the _Times_, 14th November 1891). Miss Hervey finds an\r\nexplanation in the fact that the Bishop of Lavaur was devoted to the\r\ncause of religious re-union between the Roman Catholic and the Reformed\r\nChurches. The doctrine expressed by the two hymns was common to all the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n[246] For further particulars the reader is referred to _Holbein's\r\n'Ambassadors': the Picture and the Men_, by Mary F. S. Hervey (1900).\r\nMiss Hervey gives an interesting account of her identification of the\r\nsitters, and many curious speculations as to the details of the picture.\r\n\r\n[247] It has been suggested by some high authorities that the lower\r\nportion of the picture was probably left to some pupil to finish; for\r\nthe Admiral's legs are very flabbily drawn. They look as if there\r\nwere no bone or muscle in them, but only sawdust or padding. Señor de\r\nBereute, in spite of the very definite history of the picture given by\r\nPalomino, attributes the whole work not to Velazquez but to his pupil\r\nand son-in-law, J. B. del Mazo (1308). If this be correct, Mazo was\r\nanother Velazquez. There is nothing in Mazo's known works to justify\r\nsuch an estimate of his powers. \"Mazo, still in his early youth, had\r\nin 1634 married a daughter of Velazquez, and had only recently got a\r\nsubordinate place in Philip's court. It is hard to believe that he\r\ncould have painted this superb picture when only about 25 years of\r\nage, or that Philip would have entrusted him with the portrait of a\r\nfavourite when he had beside him his trusty Court painter, Velazquez\"\r\n(_Quarterly Review_, April 1899, p. 521).\r\n\r\n[248] \"Congratulate me (he wrote to his old friend and colleague,\r\nSir H. A. Layard) on a real _trouvaille_. The picture I bought at\r\nG. Bentinck's sale has come out splendidly, and is in first-rate\r\ncondition. Burton is greatly struck with it. It is a wonderful bit\r\nof luck to have picked up so fine a picture from among so many of\r\nthe cognoscenti.\" No wonder that Sir William Gregory, who bought his\r\npictures so cheap, was aghast at the large and even fancy price which\r\nthe nation sometimes has to pay. \"The cost of them,\" he writes of the\r\nLongford pictures (Nos. 1314-1316) \"makes me blush when I think of it.\"\r\n\r\n[249] The composition, however, has been blamed on the ground that\r\nthe square picture on the wall interferes with the girl's head in a\r\nvery awkward manner. The Cupid represented in that picture is also\r\nvery clumsy. A correspondent replying to these criticisms writes:\r\n\"The composition depends not upon the rhythm of the lines, but upon\r\nthe arrangement of patches of colour, somewhat in the manner of the\r\nJapanese. Dutch painters often represented inferior pictures upon\r\nthe walls of their interiors, perhaps as a kind of humorous contrast\r\nto their own masterpieces. See, for instance, the daub in De Hooch's\r\npicture in the National Gallery (No. 834).\"\r\n\r\n[250] By Mr. Berenson ascribed to \"Amico di Sandro.\"\r\n\r\n[251] \"Hung on each side of the great Vandyck, on the east wall of\r\nthe principal Dutch and Flemish room, they have given the completing\r\ntouch to that collection of _chefs d'oeuvre_, and made it now beyond\r\nquestion the finest wall of masterpieces of those schools in Europe\"\r\n(Sir Edward Poynter's speech at the Royal Academy Banquet, 1899).\r\n\r\n[252] The purchase for the nation was at one time in jeopardy. Early in\r\n1899 the two pictures were offered by Lord de Saumarez to the National\r\nGallery for the sum of £12,500. A special grant was obtained from Her\r\nMajesty's Treasury for this sum on the condition that the Trustees\r\nshould forego the annual grant for 1899-1900, estimated at £5000.\r\nLord de Saumarez found, however, that he had no power to sell the\r\npictures without an order from the Court of Chancery, and having been\r\nsubsequently offered the sum of £15,000 for these two pictures, the\r\nCourt decided they could only be sold to the National Gallery for an\r\nadvance on the sum offered. The Trustees, therefore, offered the sum of\r\n£15,050, for which the Court awarded them to the Trustees. Towards the\r\nbalance of the purchase money, amounting to £2550, two of the Trustees,\r\nMr. Alfred de Rothschild and Mr. Heseltine, liberally contributed £500\r\neach, and the remainder, amounting to £1550, was paid out of the grant\r\nfor the year 1898-99.\r\n\r\n[253] Mr. Roger Fry (in _The Pilot_, Jan. 5, 1901) attributes our\r\npicture, which he calls \"a distressing production,\" to \"some journeyman\r\npainter who treated Fra Bartolommeo's design in the spirit of the\r\nearlier furniture painters, but without their charm and _naïveté_.\"\r\n\r\n[254] \"His early pictures have only a hint of personal expression.\r\nSome of his Madonnas are still almost Byzantine in their hieratic\r\nsolemnity. It is possible to follow Giovanni Bellini's career almost\r\nfrom year to year by the increase of personal expression in his figures\r\nand landscapes\" (Mary Logan: _Guide to the Italian Pictures at Hampton\r\nCourt_, p. 9).\r\n\r\n[255] See Bernhard Berenson's _Lorenzo Lotto_, 1895, pp. 21-120.\r\n\r\n[256] See Mr. Herbert Cook's _Giorgione_, pp. 68-74.\r\n\r\n[257] That fine picture came from the Manfrini Palace at Venice; and\r\nthough by some called a \"bad and late copy\" (Mündler, _Beiträge zu B.'s\r\nCicerone_, 1870, p. 61) is by others highly praised. Thus Waagen, in\r\nhis _Treasures of Art in Great Britain_ (vol. iii. 1854, p. 19), in\r\ndescribing the Cobham Hall pictures, says of the picture now in the\r\nNational Gallery that it \"agrees essentially with the fine portrait in\r\nthe Manfrini collection at Venice. But the tone of the flesh is heavier\r\nhere, and the grey colour of the dress unites too much with the grey\r\nground, while in the Manfrini picture, the brown tones of the dress\r\nstand out decidedly from it.\"\r\n\r\n[258] See the _Second Annual Report of the National Art Collections\r\nFund_, 1906, pp. 35, 36. Until the matter was cleared up by the\r\nresearches of Señor de Beruete, summarised in that Report, it was\r\nsupposed that our picture was one of five mythologies painted by\r\nVelazquez for the Gallery of Mirrors in the Alcazar of Madrid, two of\r\nwhich perished in the great fire of 1734. Knowledge of this fire was\r\ndoubtless the origin of a suggestion that our picture also had been\r\ndamaged and repainted. There was correspondence on this subject, and\r\non others connected with the picture, in the _Times_ of November and\r\nDecember 1905 and the early part of 1906.\r\n\r\n[259] The intermediate processes by which the price of the picture rose\r\nfrom £30,500 to £45,000 have not been disclosed. Towards the latter\r\nsum, the largest contributions were--\"An Englishman\" £10,000; Lord\r\nMichelham, £8000; and Messrs. Agnew, £5250.\r\n\r\n[260] See pp. 75-78 of _The Barbizon School_, by D. C. Thomson, from\r\nwhose translation I borrow a few sentences.\r\n\r\n[261] According to William Morris, most visitors to the Gallery are apt\r\nto pass by some of its principal treasures. \"If ordinary people go to\r\nour National Gallery, the thing which they want to see is the Blenheim\r\nRaphael, which, though well done, is a very dull picture to any one\r\nnot an artist. While, when Holbein shows them the Danish princess of\r\nthe sixteenth century yet living on the canvas ...; when Van Eyck\r\nopens a window for them into Bruges of the fourteenth century; when\r\nBotticelli shows them Heaven as it lived in the hearts of men before\r\ntheology was dead, these things produce no impression on them, not so\r\nmuch even as to stimulate their curiosity and make them ask what 'tis\r\nall about; because these things were done to be looked at, and to make\r\nthe eyes tell the mind tales of the past, the present, and the future\"\r\n(Mackail's _Life of William Morris_, ii. 273).\r\n\r\n[262] The precise nature of the transaction was this:--Lady Carlisle\r\nreceived in cash £40,000 and the Treasury paid the death-duties\r\n(£2776). Of these sums, the National Gallery funds contributed £15,000;\r\nthe National Art-Collections' Fund, £10,000; and the Treasury £17,776\r\n(see House of Commons Debate, February 28, 1912).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPICTURES ON LOAN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOLY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n  _B. Fungai_ (Sienese: about 1460-1516). _See 1331._\r\n\r\nThis picture, not yet numbered, is lent by the Victoria and Albert\r\n(South Kensington) Museum. It is generally characteristic of Fungai,\r\nbut the figure of the Infant Christ is not pleasing.\r\n\r\n_Lent by Mr. Pierpont Morgan._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MADONNA DI SANTI ANTONIO.\r\n\r\n  _Raphael_ (Urbino: 1483-1520). _See 1171._\r\n\r\n\"In the same city (says Vasari)--[the city of Perugia, for which also\r\nthe Ansidei Madonna was painted]--Raphael was commissioned to paint a\r\npicture of Our Lady by the nuns of Sant' Antonio of Padua; the Infant\r\nChrist is in the lap of the Virgin and is fully clothed, as it pleased\r\nthose simple and pious ladies that he should be; on each side of Our\r\nLady are figures of saints, San Pietro, namely, with San Paolo, Santa\r\nCecilia, and Santa Catarina. To these two holy virgins the master has\r\ngiven the most lovely features and the most graceful attitudes; he has\r\nalso adorned them with the most fanciful and varied head-dresses that\r\ncould be imagined--a very unusual thing at that time. In a lunette\r\nabove this picture he painted a figure of the Almighty Father, which is\r\nextremely fine, and on the predella are three scenes from the history\r\nof Christ, in very small figures.... The whole work is without doubt\r\nvery admirable; it is full of devout feeling, and is held in the utmost\r\nveneration by the nuns for whom it was painted. It is very highly\r\ncommended by all painters likewise.\"\r\n\r\nThe small scenes which formed the predella have been dispersed;[263]\r\nfor the rest, the picture thus described by Vasari is before us. Vasari\r\ndates the work 1505, but it is now commonly ascribed to the years\r\n1507-8, after Raphael had experienced the influence of Fra Bartolommeo;\r\nit would thus be a little later than the Ansidei Madonna.\r\n\r\nThe history of the picture is long and eventful. In 1677 the nuns\r\nobtained permission to sell it, \"to pay their debts and because the\r\nsurface was in some parts flaking away.\" The central panel and the\r\nlunette (forming the picture as it now is) were bought by Antonio\r\nBigazzini, a nobleman of Perugia, for a sum of about £500. Shortly\r\nafterwards, the picture passed into the hands of the great Colonna\r\nfamily at Rome, and it is often called \"The Colonna Raphael.\" The\r\nfortunes of the picture now became part of those of modern Italian\r\nhistory. In the last century, the picture had been bought by Francis\r\nII., King of Naples. It was a great favourite of his, and was always\r\nkept in his bedroom in the Royal Palace. When the revolution of 1860\r\ncame, and the king was driven out of Naples, the Raphael accompanied\r\nhim on his wanderings, and the king succeeded in conveying it in\r\nsafety to the fortress of Gaeta. When Gaeta fell in 1861, and the\r\nking went into exile, he again took the picture with him, and it was\r\nsafely transported to Spain. The king was accompanied in his flight\r\nby the financier and factotum, formerly Spanish Minister at Naples,\r\nupon whom he had conferred the title of Duke of Ripalda. To him the\r\nking in some way pledged the picture, and for a time it became known\r\nas the Ripalda Raphael. Its history next becomes connected with the\r\nsecular jealousies of England and France. In 1867 Sir J. C. Robinson\r\nsaw the picture at Madrid, and received a hint that it might possibly\r\nbe for sale. Sir William Boxall, the Director of our Gallery, went to\r\ninspect the picture, which was then in fine condition; and Disraeli\r\nauthorised the trustees to buy it. Negotiations were commenced on the\r\nbasis of £20,000; but the Duke of Ripalda was a friend of the Empress\r\nEugénie, and the knowledge that England was in the market inspired a\r\ncounter-bid of £40,000 from France. The outbreak of the Prussian War\r\ncaused a hitch in the negotiations; and the picture, which had been\r\nsent to Paris, underwent rigorous \"restoration.\" The Colonna Raphael,\r\nwrote Sir William Gregory (May 1870), \"was, a few months ago, one of\r\nthe most perfect and important pictures of that master. In an evil\r\nmoment it had been submitted to the cleaner, and a piteous spectacle\r\nit now is in the eyes of gods and men. It is said that on the old\r\nframe being removed, the picture fell to the ground in three pieces.\r\nThis is confirmed by the extraordinary winking appearance of the eye\r\nof one of the female saints, through which unfortunately one of the\r\ncracks runs, and which therefore had to be repainted by a modern hand.\"\r\nRuskin, perhaps unaware of these repaintings or believing that they\r\ncould be removed, strongly urged the acquisition of the picture for the\r\nnation (_Works_, xxii. 140, xxxiv. 512). But the authorities would not\r\nentertain the idea, and the picture, refused both by the Louvre and by\r\nthe National Gallery, returned, unpurchased and unhonoured, into the\r\nhands of the Duke. In 1886 it was lent to the South Kensington Museum\r\nand there it remained for several years, until Mr. Martin Colnaghi\r\nbought it from the representatives of the late King of Naples. The\r\nParisian repaintings were removed, and the picture was restored to much\r\nof its pristine beauty. Ultimately it passed into the possession of Mr.\r\nPierpont Morgan (at the price, it is said, of £100,000), and by him it\r\nis for the present lent to the National Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADORATION OF THE MAGI.\r\n\r\n  _Unknown_ (Spanish: end of 15th century).\r\n\r\nSigned \"Lo Fil de Mestre Rodrigo.\" Lent by the Victoria and Albert\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[263] In addition to the \"three scenes\" mentioned by Vasari there\r\nwere two single figures, of St. Francis and St. Anthony of Padua\r\nrespectively: these are in the Dulwich Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPIES FROM THE OLD MASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--_VELAZQUEZ_\r\n\r\nOne collection is of fifty-nine copies in oil-colour, on a reduced\r\nscale, of pictures by Velazquez in the Prado Gallery, at Madrid,\r\npresented by Lord Savile.

A large\r\ncollection of water-copies from the Old Masters was thus accumulated,\r\nand the Collection was in 1897 deposited in the National Gallery on\r\nloan. Two years later, the Society was wound up, and the collection\r\nwas given to the nation. It is of great interest and value to all\r\nstudents of mediæval art. Many of the Arundel copies are familiar from\r\nreproductions in chromo-lithography. \"The latter,\" as a well-known\r\ncritic has remarked, \"although they undoubtedly did good service in\r\ntheir time by calling attention to the less known and less easily\r\navailable masterpieces of the earlier Italian art, were often\r\nenough lamentable caricatures of the things which they professed to\r\nrepresent. The drawings themselves are, however, in many cases, of an\r\nexquisite accuracy, of which the reproductions give little or no idea.\r\nOf course, when the attempt is made to copy in this medium the great\r\nachievements of Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, Palma Vecchio,\r\nPaolo Veronese,--or even of such earlier colourists as the Van Eycks\r\nand Memlinc,--failure, more or less complete, must inevitably be the\r\nresult. It would be difficult, on the other hand, to overestimate the\r\nvalue of such copies as those of the famous frescoes of Mantegna in\r\nthe Church of the Eremitani at Padua, those of Benozzo Gozzoli at San\r\nGimignano and Montefalco, of Piero della Francesca at Arezzo, or of\r\nthe great galaxy of Quattrocento painters--Perugino, Pinturicchio,\r\nBotticelli, Ghirlandajo, Signorelli, Cosimo Rosselli, and Piero di\r\nCosimo--who worked in the Sixtine Chapel before Michelangelo came to\r\ndwarf and efface them with his stupendous ceiling, and, thirty years\r\nlater on, with his 'Last Judgment.' For the purposes of study and\r\ncomparison these copies, lent by the Arundel Society, fulfil much the\r\nsame role as does a good museum of casts from antique masterpieces.\r\nThey do not enable the student of art to form a complete idea of the\r\noriginals, any more than the copies of the Pheidian and Praxitelean\r\nsculptures do; but they enlarge his view of the scope and significance\r\nof Italian and Netherlandish art in their greatest phases, and happily\r\nthey fill up gaps which must occur even in the most various and\r\nrepresentative collection, such as is the National Gallery.\"[264]\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the following catalogue may serve to bring before\r\nthe notice of visitors the importance of a collection which deserves\r\nmuch greater attention than it has hitherto received. The artists\r\nrepresented are arranged alphabetically, with references to such of\r\nthem as are also represented by original work in the National Gallery.\r\nAfter the title of each work, information is given as to the nature\r\nof the original from which the copy is made, and the place where the\r\noriginal is. The numerals after each picture refer to the numbers at\r\npresent on the frames.\r\n\r\n      ALBERTINELLI (see under 645).\r\n\r\n      The Visitation (11): picture, Uffizi, Florence.\r\n\r\n      ANDREA DEL CASTAGNO (see under 1138).\r\n\r\n      The Last Supper (120): fresco, Convent S.

In the centre is Venus with Cupid above\r\n      her head, pointing an arrow at Giuliano. Shortly after the\r\n      joust, Giuliano was murdered, and La Simonetta died. The\r\n      death-like figure to the extreme left, breathing upon Spring,\r\n      represents the premonition of these coming disasters. Simonetta\r\n      was a favourite model of Botticelli's, the same slender and\r\n      long-throated lady appearing in many of his works, though\r\n      sometimes spiritualised almost past recognition (cf. _Ariadne\r\n      Florentina_, Appendix iv.; and a sonnet by D.

Men go\r\n      forth to their labours until the evening; but she is awake\r\n      before them, and you might think that the sorrow in her face\r\n      was at the thought of the whole long day of love yet to come.\r\n      An emblematical figure of the wind blows hard across the grey\r\n      water, moving forward the dainty-tipped shell on which she\r\n      sails, the sea 'showing his teeth' as it moves in their lines\r\n      of foam, and sucking in one by one the falling roses....

The picture is mentioned by\r\n      Vasari (iii. 114): \"She is standing upright, her vestment is a\r\n      short mantle, but the figure is covered principally with the\r\n      long hair, which falls to her feet; and this is so beautiful\r\n      and natural that, while observing it, one cannot but fancy\r\n      that the light silky tresses are stirred by the wind. The\r\n      countenance, also, has the most divine beauty of expression,\r\n      and clearly exhibits the love which this Saint bore to her\r\n      Lord.\"]\r\n\r\nTITIAN (see under 4).\r\n\r\nMiracles of St. Anthony of Padua (14, 133): frescoes, Scuola del Santo,\r\nPadua.\r\n\r\n      TURA, COSIMO (see under 772).\r\n\r\n  Triumph of Venus (112): fresco, Schifanoia Palace, Ferrara.\r\n  Triumph of Minerva (129):  \"         \"            \"\r\n\r\n      UNKNOWN PAINTER.\r\n\r\n      Richard II. before the Madonna (27): picture, Wilton House.\r\n\r\n      VASCO, FERNANDEZ (\"Gran Vasco\") (Portuguese: born 1552).\r\n\r\n      St. Peter enthroned as Pope (48): picture, sacristy of the\r\n      cathedral, Vizen, Portugal.\r\n\r\n      VERONESE, PAOLO (see under 26).\r\n\r\n      Allegorical Subjects, \"Justice,\" \"Temperance,\" etc. (15, 18,\r\n      155, 156): frescoes, Villa Giacomelli, Masèr.\r\n\r\n      [This villa, built by Palladio for Daniele Barbara in 1580, is\r\n      reached from Cornuda, a station on the line between Treviso\r\n      and Belluno.

Among those that remain in Trafalgar Square are:--\r\n\r\n\"THE DYING ALEXANDER\" (_in the Vestibule_).--A Renaissance copy in\r\nEgyptian porphyry of the bust, in the Uffizi at Florence, known as\r\n\"The Dying Alexander.\" The bust is now generally recognised as the\r\nwork of a Pergamene sculptor, and is supposed to represent a youthful\r\ngiant. The influence of the \"Alexander type\" is in any case noticeable\r\nin this fine work; a type embodying \"the traces of human passion, the\r\nimperfection of human longing, the divine despair, which attach to\r\nthe highest mortal natures because they are high and because they are\r\nmortal.\"--Presented by Mr. Henry Yates Thompson.\r\n\r\nBUST OF MANTEGNA.--A plaster cast from the bust of Mantegna in\r\nthe Mantegna Chapel at Mantua: see the description quoted under\r\n274.--Presented by Mr. Henry Vaughan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[264] Among works of illustration produced of late years, \"the\r\npublications of the Arundel Society,\" says Ruskin, \"hold the first rank\r\nin purpose and principle, having been from the beginning conducted by\r\na council of gentlemen in the purest endeavour for public utility,\r\nand absolutely without taint of self-interest, or encumbrance of\r\noperation by personal or national jealousy. Failing often, as could\r\nnot but be the case when their task was one of supreme difficulty,\r\nand before unattempted, they have yet on the whole been successful\r\nin producing the most instructive and historically valuable series\r\nof engravings that have ever been put within reach of the public....\r\nI learned more from the Arundel copy than in the chapel itself; for\r\nthe daily companionship with the engraving taught me subtleties in\r\nthe composition which had escaped me in the multitudinous interest of\r\nvisits to the actual fresco\" (_Stones of Venice_, Travellers' edition,\r\nii, 176; and _Ariadne Florentina_, Appendix, p. 246).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\nINDEX LIST OF PAINTERS\r\n\r\nWITH THE SUBJECTS OF THEIR PICTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following list all the painters (of Foreign Schools) represented\r\nin the National Gallery are enumerated. Painters only represented\r\nby pictures belonging to, but now removed from, the Gallery are not\r\nincluded. The painters are given in alphabetical order, and are cited\r\nby the names by which they are most commonly known. But where such\r\nnames differ from the proper patronymics, the latter are also given,\r\nwith references to the former. Similar double references are given in\r\nother cases where doubt is likely to arise.\r\n\r\nIn the case of names with the prefix \"de\" or \"van,\" the painter should\r\nbe looked for under the initial letter of his surname: _e.g._ \"Van\r\nDyck\" under \"Dyck,\" \"Van de Cappelle\" under \"Cappelle.\"\r\n\r\nPictures by _unknown_ artists will be found under the schools to which\r\nthey severally belong: \"Dutch,\" \"Florentine,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn the case of painters represented by several pictures, the first\r\nreference after each name is to the page in the Handbook where some\r\ngeneral account of the painter will be found. The references after each\r\npicture are to the official number on its frame, under which number the\r\ndescription of the picture will be found in the preceding catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Agii, A.

These pictures are\r\ndistinguished in the Index by their titles being printed in _italics_;\r\nwhilst the name of the institution, or (in the case of provincial\r\ngalleries) the name of the town in which they are now to be seen is\r\nstated in the fourth column.\r\n\r\nIn the next two columns, the manner and date of each picture's\r\nacquisition are given. The names are those of the persons from whom the\r\npictures were purchased, or by whom they were given or bequeathed.\r\n\r\nIn the last column, the prices paid for all the purchased pictures\r\nare given. Except where otherwise specified, the funds out of which\r\npictures were purchased have been provided by Parliamentary Grants. The\r\nTrustees have at their disposal other funds derived from the Clarke,\r\nLewis, Mackrell, Temple West, and Walker bequests. (The Wheeler bequest\r\nis available for the purchase of English pictures only.) The letter\r\nC., L., M., or W. before the price in the last column denotes that the\r\nfunds were derived from one or other of those bequests.\r\n\r\nThe dates of the appointment of successive Keepers or Directors are\r\nalso given at their proper places in the Index, so that the curious\r\nreader may discover the use made by these officers of the funds at\r\ntheir disposal. It should, however, be remembered that up to 1855 the\r\nresponsibility for purchases rested rather with the Trustees and the\r\nTreasury than with the Keeper.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the cost of the pictures (both\r\nBritish[265] and Foreign) purchased up to the end of 1906:--\r\n\r\n  /================================================\\\r\n  |  PURCHASED out of PARLIAMENTARY GRANTS.        |\r\n  |------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |Pictures--                     £    _s._ _d._   |\r\n  |------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | 38 (Angerstein Collection)      57,000  0  0   |\r\n  | 31 (Lombardi-Baldi \"   )         7,035  0  0   |\r\n  | 33 (Beaucousin     \"   )         9,205  3  0   |\r\n  | 77 (Peel)          \"            75,000  0  0   |\r\n  |405 (Smaller Purchases)         332,073  8  5   |\r\n  |  2 (Blenheim Collection)        87,500  0  0   |\r\n  |  3 (Longford    \"      )        25,000  0  0   |\r\n  |  4 (Lord Northbrook)             8,000  0  0   |\r\n  |  2 (Saumarez Rembrandts)        14,050  0  0   |\r\n  |  2 (Lord Northampton)           10,000  0  0   |\r\n  |  2 (Genoa Vandycks)             25,000  0  0   |\r\n  |  1 (Lord Talbot de Malahide)    25,000  0  0   |\r\n  |---                            --------------   |\r\n  |601 pictures at a cost of    £  683,863 11  5   |\r\n  |================================================|\r\n  |  PURCHASED out of PRIVATE BEQUESTS, ETC.       |\r\n  |------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |Pictures--                        £   _s._ _d._ |\r\n  | 38           Clarke Fund        11,929  8  2   |\r\n  | 29           Lewis  \"            8,666  9  0   |\r\n  | 21           Walker \"           10,097 17  6   |\r\n  | 11           Wheeler \"           2,940  0  0   |\r\n  |   Grant from Lewis Fund towards                |\r\n  |     purchase of No. 1247           151 10  0   |\r\n  |   Gifts for Longford Pictures   30,000  0  0   |\r\n  |    \"    \"   Rembrandts           1,000  0  0   |\r\n  |   Titian's Ariosto              21,000  0  0   |\r\n  |  1 Velasquez' Venus             45,000  0  0   |\r\n  |---                            --------------   |\r\n  |100 pictures at a cost of    £  130,785  5  2   |\r\n  \\================================================/\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this table that 701 pictures in all have been\r\npurchased at a total cost of £814,648: 16: 7, an average of £1162 per\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n      A.

For\r\nthese see Vol. II.\r\n\r\n[266] The number of this picture has now been given to the foregoing,\r\nwhich has only recently been exhibited.\r\n\r\n[267] This picture does not appear in the Official Catalogue; nor can I\r\nfind any trace, in the Director's Annual Reports, of what was done with\r\nit. Its number has now been given to the foregoing picture, which has\r\nonly recently been exhibited.\r\n\r\n[268] The donor was informed when he offered these two pictures that\r\nthey were too large, in view of the limited wall-space then at the\r\ndisposal of the Gallery, to be placed in the rooms to which the public\r\nwere admitted. The pictures were presented on those terms, and for many\r\nyears were not numbered or incorporated in the Official Catalogue. They\r\nare now Nos. 2723, 2724.\r\n\r\n[269] No. 622 appears to have been missed in the official numbering.\r\n\r\n[270] No. 723 appears to have been missed in the official numbering.\r\n\r\n[271] The central portion of this triptych was bought in 1874 for £525.\r\nThe two side panels were bought in 1878, at the sale of Mr. Barker's\r\npictures, for £33:12s., and were added to the central compartment under\r\nthe same number (909).\r\n\r\n[272] £1224 from public Funds, £151:10s. from Lewis Fund.\r\n\r\n[273] 1313 and 1318 were purchased together for £2500.\r\n\r\n[274] £25,000 from a Parliamentary Grant; £30,000 from private gifts\r\n(see p. xv.)\r\n\r\n[275] 1313 and 1318 were purchased together for £2500.\r\n\r\n[276] 1324 and 1326 were purchased together for £2500.\r\n\r\n[277] Under the terms of Sir C. Eastlake's will these pictures were\r\noffered to the National Gallery at the prices which he paid for them.\r\n\r\n[278] This sum was made up as follows:--Special Grant from the\r\nTreasury, £12,500; from the Annual Grant for 1898-99, £1550; gifts by\r\nMr. Alfred de Rothschild and Mr. Heseltine, £500 each.\r\n\r\n[279] £9000 from the Parliamentary grant; the remainder subscribed by\r\nMr. W. W. Astor, Mr. A. Beit, Lord Burton, Lord Iveagh, Mr. J. Pierpont\r\nMorgan, and Lady Wantage.\r\n\r\n[280] To this sum Messrs. Colnaghi contributed £1000.\r\n\r\n[281] Presented by the National Art-Collections Fund with the aid of a\r\ngrant from the Government of £10,000.\r\n\r\n[282] The National Gallery funds provided £15,000; the Treasury made\r\na special grant of £15,000; and the National Art-Collections Fund\r\ncontributed £10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Transcriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n      Obvious spelling & typos corrected.\r\n\r\n      Italic is enclosed in _underscores_.\r\n\r\n      Bold is enclosed in =equals=.\r\n\r\n      [Symbol: hand pointing right] has been replaced with -->.\r\n\r\n      Removed first MACMILLAN AND CO., LTD., LONDON from the books\r\n      on art section as it is redundant.\r\n\r\n      P. xix through xxi is a list of updates. Author mostly used\r\n      \"see also\" notation in the INDEX LIST OF PAINTERS for the old\r\n      reference. Added same notation to missed index entries.
