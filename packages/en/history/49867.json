PREFATORY STATEMENT\r\n\r\nThe theme to which this volume is specifically limited is the\r\nposition and achievements of learned women in England in the period\r\nbetween 1650 and 1760. But before entering upon this detailed\r\nstudy it seems desirable to give a preliminary sketch of the work\r\nof learned women in England before 1650. In such a sketch it is,\r\nindeed, a temptation to go farther back along the path of history\r\nthan a single volume would allow. It is difficult, for instance,\r\nto avoid some account of the women of genius notable in the great\r\ndays of Greece and Rome.[1] More fascinating still would be a close\r\nstudy of the learned nuns of the Middle Ages.[2] St. Radegunde,\r\nAbbess of Poitiers, a poet of considerable distinction; St. Hilda,\r\nwho governed her double monastery at Whitby so successfully as to\r\nput it \"in the forefront of intellectual agencies in Great Britain\";\r\nthe group of learned nuns who corresponded with St. Boniface, chief\r\namong them being St. Lioba, who made of her convent at Bischopsheim,\r\nGermany, \"the most important educational center in that part of\r\nEurope\"; Hroswitha of Gandersheim, whose seven dramas \"caused the\r\ntragic muse to emerge once more from the midnight gloom of the Middle\r\nAges\";[3] St. Hildegard, \"the most voluminous woman writer of the\r\nMiddle Ages\"; St. Herrad, author of an encyclopædic work entitled\r\n_Hortus Deliciarum_, or _Garden of Delight_--these are but a few of\r\nthe women whose lives and works offer a field for profitable and\r\ninteresting investigation.\r\n\r\nEmily James Putnam, in her acute study, _The Lady_, says of this\r\nconvent life:\r\n\r\n  No institution of Europe has ever won for the lady the freedom\r\n  and development that she enjoyed in the convent in the early\r\n  days. The modern colleges for women only feebly reproduce it,\r\n  since the college for women has arisen when colleges in general\r\n  are under a cloud. The lady-abbess, on the other hand, was part\r\n  of the two great social forces of her time, feudalism and the\r\n  Church. Great spiritual rewards and great worldly prizes were\r\n  alike within her grasp. She was treated as an equal by men of\r\n  her time as is witnessed by letters we still have from popes\r\n  and emperors to abbesses. She had the stimulus of competition\r\n  with men in executive capacity, in scholarship, and in artistic\r\n  production, since her work was freely set before the general\r\n  public: but she was relieved by the circumstances of her\r\n  environment from the ceaseless competition in common life of\r\n  woman with woman for the favor of the individual man. In the\r\n  cloister of the great days, as on a small scale in the college\r\n  for women to-day, women were judged by each other as men are\r\n  everywhere judged by each other, for sterling qualities of head\r\n  and heart and character.[4]\r\n\r\nFrom mediæval poems and romances also come glimpses, tantalizingly\r\nbrief and casual, to be sure, yet glimpses indicative of a tendency\r\nto count learning as one of the possible charms of a heroine.[5] The\r\ndelightful lady in _Cursor Mundi_, who was described as \"learnyd,\r\nware and wise,\" was also said to be \"of much price lovéd.\" A later\r\nmaid, likewise of \"grete prys,\" could vie with a modern college girl\r\nin the variety and extent of her knowledge:\r\n\r\n      Wyse sche was and curtes of mowthe,\r\n      All the vii arse sche cowthe.\r\n      She had maystures at hur honde,\r\n      The wysest men of that londe,\r\n      And taght hur astronomye,\r\n      Arsmetryck and gemetrye.\r\n      That mayde was of grete prys\r\n      For sche was bothe warre and wyse.[6]\r\n\r\nIn _Floris and Blanchefleur_, Floris refused to study unless\r\nBlanchefleur was taught with him, and she prospered so at her books\r\nthat her lore was a wonder to all. When she and Floris had been in\r\nschool five years together, they knew Latin and could write well on\r\nparchment. When Floris went to visit his aunt she set him to learn\r\nmany things, as other children did, \"bot maydons and grome.\"[7] The\r\nwife of Sir Bevis of Hamtoun was taught \"fysik and sirgerie\" by great\r\nmasters from Bologna.[8] Melior, the fair mistress of Partonope of\r\nBlois, since she was the only heir to the kingdom, was sent to school\r\nthat she might get great wisdom. She says, \"A hundred mastres I had\r\nand mo,\" and adds that God graciously inclined her to learning so\r\nthat she came to know \"the seven sciences\" perfectly. She was also\r\ntrained in herbs and \"phisike,\" in \"Divinite and Nygromancy.\"[9]\r\nThaise, in _Apollonius of Tyre_, combined the \"wisdom of a clerk\" with\r\n\r\n                      every lusti werk,\r\n      Which to a gentlewoman longeth.\r\n\r\n      She was wel kept, sche was wel loked\r\n      Sche was wel tawht, sche was wel boked\r\n      So wel sche spedde hir in hire yowthe\r\n      That sche of every wisdom cowthe.[10]\r\n\r\nMedea, in Lydgate's _Troy Book_, had so passionate a desire for\r\nknowledge that she became in all the \"artis called liberal\" as expert\r\nand knowing as the best. She was powerful in logic, astronomy, and\r\nnecromancy.[11]\r\n\r\nBut the highly prized ladies of romance, the abbesses with all their\r\npomp and influence, the women poets, philosophers, and orators of\r\nGreece and Rome, all lose interest when compared with the story of\r\nthe learned women in Italy during the Renascence. When we come to\r\nthe actual flowering time of their genius the list is so long as to\r\nmake selection difficult. \"Never in history,\" says Mozans, \"had they\r\ngreater freedom of action in things of the mind; never were they,\r\nexcept probably in the case of the English and German abbesses of the\r\nMiddle Ages, treated with more marked deference and consideration\r\nor fairness; never were their efforts more highly appreciated or\r\nmore generously rewarded.... Everywhere the intellectual arena was\r\nopen to them on the same terms as to men. Incapacity and not sex was\r\nthe only bar to entrance.\"[12] When the great Cardinal Bembo said,\r\n\"Little girls should learn Latin; it completes their charm,\" he was\r\nexpressing the attitude of the best Italian scholars towards learning\r\nfor women. Intellectual attainments were not only counted appropriate\r\nfor women, but they were recognized as a distinct added attraction.\r\nEvery city of importance had women whose renown was a source of civic\r\npride. Women not only studied under tutors, but they apparently\r\nattended classes in the great universities, and even occupied\r\nimportant chairs in the most distinguished faculties.[13]\r\n\r\nThe outcome of a general investigation along the lines indicated\r\nwould doubtless go to prove that in all civilized nations, in all\r\nages of their progress, there have been individual women who by\r\nforce of native endowment and through some favorable conjunction of\r\ncircumstances, have risen into prominence in realms not ordinarily\r\nopen to the women of their time, and that there have been various\r\ninteresting epochs when women have responded in fairly large numbers\r\nto some exceptional intellectual stimulus.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PERIOD OF HENRY VIII AND ELIZABETH\r\n\r\nThe first woman author in the English language is probably Juliana\r\nBarnes (or Berners), whose delight in hunting, hawking, and fishing,\r\nalong with a surprising amount of technical knowledge on these\r\nsubjects, led her to write, in 1481, a book for \"the gentill men and\r\nhonest persones\" whose tastes coincided with hers. But this lady was\r\nprioress of Sopewell Nunnery and comes under the list of learned\r\nnuns.[14] Genuine interest in books on the part of women in secular\r\nlife in England received one of its earliest manifestations in the\r\nwill of the Duchess of Buckingham who left to her daughter-in-law,\r\nMargaret, the Countess of Richmond,[15] \"a book of English, being\r\na legend of Saints; a book of French, called Lucun; another book\r\nof French, of the Epistles and Gospels; and a Primmer with clasps\r\nof silver gilt, covered with purple velvet.\" This legacy was an\r\nimportant recognition of the literary tastes of the Countess of\r\nRichmond who had, says Ballard, \"a fine library stored with Latin,\r\nFrench and English books, not collected for ornament, or to make a\r\nfigure (as is frequently the case) but for use.\" The Countess knew\r\nFrench and had some knowledge of Latin. She also entered the field\r\nof authorship, publishing before 1509 _The mirroure of golde for the\r\nsinfull soule_, \"translated at Parice out of Laten into Frenshe ...\r\nand now of late translated out of Frenshe into Englishe by the right\r\nexcellent Princess Margaret.\" This right noble Margaret was likewise\r\na patroness of literature and a guardian of learning. She established\r\nlectureships in divinity, maintained scholarships for poor students,\r\nfounded two colleges, and in other ways manifested her interest in\r\nthe progress of education.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Richmond as a lover of books, as a translator of\r\nreligious works, and particularly as an intelligent and ardent\r\npatron of learning, foreshadowed feminine activities of a later\r\nday. But the learned lady as a recognized factor in social life had\r\nno real place in England till the time of Henry VIII. Renascence\r\nideas concerning the education of women came into England from\r\nSpain through Catherine, the first wife of Henry VIII. She was in\r\nEngland from 1501 to 1531. Under the influence of her mother, Queen\r\nIsabella,[16] she had been given remarkable educational advantages.\r\nQueen Isabella was interested in all that pertained to learning.\r\nShe was a collector of books and contributed important accessions\r\nto Spanish libraries. She knew several modern languages and had a\r\n\"critically accurate\" knowledge of Latin. Learning for women was\r\nencouraged at her court. The queen had herself a lady teacher,\r\nBeatrix Galindo, who was professor of rhetoric at the University\r\nof Salamanca, and who was called, for her knowledge of the Latin\r\nlanguage, _La Latina_. Other learned ladies of Spain were doubtless\r\nknown at the court, as Francisca de Lebrixa who often took the place\r\nof her father, professor of history in the University of Alcala;\r\nor Doña Maria Pacheco de Mendoza and her sister, who are mentioned\r\nby Mr. Foster as the parallels of Sir Thomas More's daughters in\r\nEngland.[17] In this eager, ambitious, intellectual atmosphere\r\nthe daughters of Isabella were brought up. She gave them personal\r\ninstruction, and secured for them foreign teachers of eminence.\r\nErasmus said that Catherine had been happily reared on letters from\r\nher infancy, that she loved literature, and that she was _egregie\r\ndocta_. In the English court Queen Catherine's influence was all\r\non the side of learning. Mr. Watson says that all the treatises on\r\nthe education of women that appeared in England between 1523 and\r\n1538 were under the spell of Catherine.[18] In the education of her\r\nown daughter, the Princess Mary, she kept to the traditions of the\r\nSpanish court and secured the most learned tutors for the young girl.\r\nDr. Lynacre wrote for the child Princess a _Rudiments of Grammar_.\r\nHis successor was Juan Luis Vives, who came to England in 1523 on the\r\ninvitation of Henry VIII. Whether Vives actually taught the Princess\r\nor not, he wrote, in 1523, as director of her studies, two Latin\r\ntreatises, both dedicated to Queen Catherine. The first of these,\r\n_De Institutione Fæminæ Christiannæ_, was translated into English\r\nby Richard Hyrde before 1528 (though not printed till 1540) under\r\nthe title, _The Instruction of a Christian Woman_. Hyrde dedicated\r\nhis translation to Catherine because of her gracious zeal \"to the\r\nvirtuous education of the womankind of this realm.\" Vives's second\r\ntreatise, _De Ratione Studii_, an account of the studies appropriate\r\nfor a young girl, appeared in 1524, and many editions are listed.\r\nStill another treatise is by subject-matter and chronology closely\r\nconnected with the two essays by Vives. In 1524 there appeared a\r\ntranslation by Margaret Roper of Erasmus's _Treatise on the Lord's\r\nPrayer_. The Introduction was by Mr. Hyrde, and its importance is\r\nindicated by Mr. Watson when he calls it \"the first reasoned claim of\r\nthe Renascence period, written in English, for the higher education\r\nof women.\" These treatises by Vives and Hyrde have much in common\r\nand they express the most advanced contemporary ideas on woman's\r\neducation. That the place of woman is in the home is emphatically\r\nstated. Housewifery is imperative. Vives has a charming passage on\r\nthe handling of wool and flax, \"two crafts yet left of that old\r\ninnocent world,\" crafts of which no woman, be she princess or queen,\r\nmay be rightly ignorant.[19] Almost equal in quaint interest is\r\nhis defense of the kitchen: \"Nor let nobody loathe the name of the\r\nkitchen: namely, being a thing very necessary, without the which\r\nneither sick folks can amend nor whole folks live.\" The lady should\r\nalso be mistress of a closet of medicaments which she must be able to\r\nadminister with skill. Occupations that involve any sort of publicity\r\nare counted inappropriate for women, hence Vives gives \"no license\r\nto a woman to be a teacher.\"[20] The essential feminine virtues are\r\npiety and modesty. Obedience to parents and to husbands is enjoined.\r\nThis obedience, if born of inner concord, might be a voluntary and\r\nideal thing. The mother of Vives is given as an example of the true\r\nwifely attitude: \"My mother Blanche when she had been fifteen years\r\nmarried unto my father, I could never see her strive with my father.\r\nThere were two sayings that she had ever in her mouth as proverbs.\r\nWhen she would say she believed well anything, then she used to\r\nsay, even as though Luis Vives had spoken it. When she would say\r\nthat she would [wished] anything, she used to say, even as though\r\nLuis Vives would it.\"[21] In all these points Vives and Hyrde were\r\nquite in accord with their age. The new element in their creed was\r\nthat learning could make women more attractive, companionable, and\r\nefficient in these home relationships.[22] Hyrde considers the man\r\nthat \"had leaver have his wife a fool than a wise woman\" as \"worse\r\nthan twice frantic.\" Maids must be good, says Vives, but learning\r\nwill fortify them and make them more truly good. In fact, according\r\nto Vives and Hyrde, there are no bounds to be set to the learning of\r\nwomen except those involved in the one general prescription that all\r\ntheir studies must tend to the development of character. Romances,\r\nfor instance, are forbidden because they give false ideals, while\r\nethical and religious books are strongly commended.[23]\r\n\r\nThe Princess Mary was too young to know the significance of the\r\nessays in her behalf, but she profited by the training accorded her.\r\nWhen she was but nine she was addressed by commissioners from Holland\r\nin the Latin tongue and responded in the same language \"with as much\r\nassurance and facility as if she had been twelve years of age.\"[24]\r\nHer parents were proud of her achievements and planned to have her\r\nlearn modern languages. Later in life, at the solicitation of Queen\r\nCatherine Parr, she translated Erasmus's _Paraphrase on the Gospel of\r\nSt. John_, and her work was highly praised.\r\n\r\nThe example set at court was followed in many noble families. There\r\nis in the realm of education no single picture more entertaining\r\nand attractive than that of Sir Thomas More and his daughters. Our\r\nknowledge of this family comes from various sources, the chief of\r\nwhich are a description written by Erasmus in a letter to John Faber,\r\nand the letters written by Sir Thomas to the tutors and to his\r\ndaughters, especially to his daughter Margaret.[25] Sir Thomas could\r\nnot see why learning was not as suitable for girls as for boys. In a\r\nletter to Gunnel he wrote:\r\n\r\n  Neither is there anie difference in harvest time, whether it was\r\n  man or woman, that sowed first the corne: for both of them beare\r\n  name of a reasonable creature equally, whose nature reason only\r\n  doth distinguish from bruite beastes, and therefore I do not\r\n  see why learning in like manner may not equally agree with both\r\n  sexes; for by it, reason is cultivated, and (as a fielde) sowed\r\n  with wholesome precepts, it bringeth excellent fruit. But if the\r\n  soyle of woman's braine be of its own nature bad, and apter to\r\n  beare fearne then corne (by which saying manie doe terrifye women\r\n  from learning) I am of opinion therefore that a woman's witt\r\n  is the more diligently by good instructions and learning to be\r\n  manured, to the ende, the defect of nature may be redressed by\r\n  industrie.[26]\r\n\r\nIn describing the ideal wife he said: \"May she be learned, if\r\npossible, or at least capable of being made so,\"[27] and he gave\r\nthe same training to Margaret and her sisters as to his son John.\r\nThe fame of these daughters went far. Symon Grinæus, in dedicating\r\nhis Plato to John, speaks of the young man's sisters as those \"whom\r\na divine heat of the spirit, to the admiration and a new example\r\nof this our age, hath driven into the sea of learning so far, and\r\nso happily, that they see no learning to be above their reach, no\r\ndisputation of philosophy above their capacity.\"[28] Margaret, the\r\ndaughter \"most like her father both in favour and wit,\" and \"a rare\r\nwoman for learning, sanctity, and secrecy,\"[29] was especially the\r\nsource of his pride. His delight in her overflows in his charming\r\nresponse to a letter from her asking for money: \"You aske monye,\r\ndeare Megg, too shamefully and fearefully of your father, who is\r\nboth desirous to giue it you, and your letter hath deserued it,\r\nwhich I could find in my heart to recompence, not as Alexander did\r\nby Cherilus, giuing him for every verse a Philipine of golde; but if\r\nmy abilities were answerable to my will, I would bestowe two Crownes\r\nof pure golde for euery sillable thereof.\"[30] He found her Latin\r\nletters written in so pure a style that \"Momus, his censure though\r\nnever so teastie,\" could find no fault in them. Sir Thomas took\r\noccasion to show these letters and other compositions by Margaret to\r\nthe Bishop of Exeter and to Reginald Pole, both good judges of any\r\nliterary performance; and Margaret's attainments seemed to both \"as a\r\nmiracle.\" Of Mr. Pole's amazement Sir Thomas wrote:\r\n\r\n  I could scarce make him believe, but that you had some help\r\n  from your maister, until I told him seriously that you had not\r\n  only never a maister in your house, but also never another man,\r\n  that needed not your help rather in writing anie thing, than\r\n  you needed his. In the mean time I thought with myself how true\r\n  I found that now, which once I remember I spoke unto you in\r\n  jeaste, when I pittied your hard happe, that men that read your\r\n  writings would suspect you to have had help from some other man\r\n  therein; which would derrogate somewhat from the praises due to\r\n  your workes; seeing that you of all others deserve least to have\r\n  such a suspition had of you, for that you never could abide to be\r\n  decked with the plumes of other birds.[31]\r\n\r\nBut sweet Meg is praised because she studies for love of learning,\r\nnot for fame, and contents herself with her husband and father as a\r\nsufficient audience. When Margaret married the best wish her father\r\ncould make was that her children should be most like to herself,\r\n\"except only in sex,\" yet he adds that a daughter who could imitate\r\nher mother's learning and virtues would be of more worth than \"three\r\nboys.\"[32]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FAMILY OF SIR THOMAS MORE\r\n\r\nHans Holbein pinxit. W. Parsons sculp. 1815\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in _Effigies Poeticae_, London, 1824, Vol. II]\r\n\r\nMargaret had three sons and two daughters and she took the same care\r\nof their education as had been taken of hers. Dr. John Morwen, a\r\nnoted Greek scholar, was preceptor in Greek and Latin to her daughter\r\nMary. Other tutors were Dr. Cole and Dr. Christopherson, also famous\r\nfor Greek. Mary seems to have followed in her mother's footsteps so\r\nfar as attention to learned pursuits is concerned, but without her\r\nmother's ability and charm. Her Latin orations were, however, so much\r\nadmired that her tutor, Dr. Morwen, translated them into English. Sir\r\nThomas More's other daughters, Elizabeth Dancy (b. 1509) and Cecilia\r\nHeron (b. 1510), and Margaret, a talented kinswoman who married her\r\ntutor, Dr. John Clement, in 1531, were given the same educational\r\nadvantages as Margaret. A characteristic eulogy of the three sisters\r\nwas by Mr. John Leland, its Latin being thus Englished in Ballard's\r\n_Memoirs_:\r\n\r\n      Forbear too much t' extoll, great Rome, from hence,\r\n      Thy fam'd Hortensius' Daughter's Eloquence;\r\n      These boasted names are now eclips'd by Three\r\n      More learned Nymphs, Great More's fair Progeny;\r\n      Who over-pas'd the Spinster's mean Employ;\r\n      The purest Latin Authors were their Joy;\r\n      They loved in Rome's political Style to write,\r\n      And with the choicest Eloquence indite,\r\n      Nor were they conversant alone in these,\r\n      They turn'd o'er Homer and Demosthenes;\r\n      From Aristotle's Store of Learning too\r\n      The mystic Art of Reasoning well they drew.\r\n      Then blush you Men if you neglect to trace\r\n      These Heights of Learning which the Female grace.[33]\r\n\r\nErasmus and Sir Thomas More were close friends and it was through\r\nthis friendship that Erasmus was converted to the idea of advanced\r\nstudies for women. In his _The Abbot and the Learned Woman_,\r\nMagdalia defends learning against the Abbot Antronius. The monk uses\r\nthe well-worn argument that woman's place is in the home, that it is\r\nher business to conduct the affairs of the family and to instruct the\r\nchildren. Magdalia does not contest this position, but urges that so\r\nweighty a business needs all possible wisdom and that through books\r\nshe gains wisdom. In a sharp attack on the ignorance of the monks she\r\nsays: \"In Spain and Italy there are not a few women belonging to the\r\nnoblest families who are a match for any man. In England there are\r\nthe Mores; in Germany the Pirckheimers and the Blaurers. And if you\r\ndon't take care, it will soon come to this, that we shall preside in\r\nthe schools of divinity, preach in the churches, and take possession\r\nof your mitres.... If you go on as you are doing it is more likely\r\nthat the geese will begin to preach than that such dumb shepherds as\r\nyou will be any longer endured.\"[34] Antronius is reduced to the weak\r\nargument that popular opinion does not favor Latin for women, and\r\nMagdalia closes the discussion with the classic defense of new ideas:\r\n\"Why do you tell me of popular opinion, which is the worst example\r\nin the world to be followed? What have I to do with custom, that is\r\nthe mistress of all evil practices? We ought to accustom ourselves to\r\nthe best things, and by that means that which was uncustomary would\r\nbecome habitual, and that which was unpleasant would become pleasant,\r\nand that which seemed unbecoming would look graceful.\"[35]\r\n\r\nThe daughters of Sir Thomas More were not the only girls trained\r\nin the best learning of the day. Another important family where\r\nparticular stress was laid on the education of the daughters was\r\nthat of Sir Anthony Coke, one of the tutors of King Edward VI.[36]\r\nMildred, the eldest daughter (1526-1589), who married Lord Burleigh,\r\nwas celebrated for her knowledge of Latin and Greek. Two other\r\ndaughters, Elizabeth, Lady Russel (b. _cir._ 1529), and Katharine,\r\nMrs. Killigrew (b. _cir._ 1530), had fine natural abilities and\r\na learned education, and were distinguished both socially and\r\nintellectually. But the most noted of the sisters was Anne (b. _cir._\r\n1527), who married Sir Nicholas Bacon, and became the mother of two\r\nremarkable sons, Anthony Bacon, and Francis Viscount St. Albans,\r\nthe great Lord Bacon. She was said to be \"exquisitely skilled in\r\nthe Greek, Latin, and Italian tongues.\" In 1550 she translated\r\ntwenty-five sermons from the Italian. In later life she did a much\r\nmore important piece of translation. Bishop Jewel had written in\r\nLatin _An Apology for the Church of England_. The book had made\r\nso great a stir that an English translation seemed desirable and\r\nLady Bacon undertook the task. She sent her translation to the\r\nArchbishop and to the author, with a letter written in Greek, that\r\nthey might correct any errors, but they found it so accurate that\r\nthey changed not the least word. In 1564 the Archbishop had the book\r\npublished without consulting Lady Bacon because he said he knew her\r\nmodesty would be abashed by any such publicity. He praised her clear\r\ntranslation saying that she \"had done honour to her sex and to the\r\ndegree of ladies.\" Lady Bacon was associated with her father in his\r\nduties as tutor to Edward VI. She also conducted the early education\r\nof her sons and they owed much to her wise care and great ability.\r\nSir Anthony Coke believed that women should be educated on the same\r\nlines as men, and that they were quite as capable of acquiring\r\nknowledge, and his own daughters brilliantly sustained this theory.\r\n\r\nA third distinguished family in which the daughters were liberally\r\neducated was that of Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset. Three of\r\nthem, Anne, Margaret, and Jane, were joint authors of _A Century of\r\nDistichs upon the Death of Queen Margaret of Navarre_, printed in\r\n1550 and later translated into Greek, French, and Italian.[37] Henry\r\nFitz Allan, Earl of Arundel, had both his daughters well trained\r\nin the classics and they had the advantage of the notable library\r\nhe had collected. The eldest, Lady Joanna Lumley[38] (d. 1576),\r\ntranslated four of the _Orations_ of Isocrates from Greek into\r\nLatin, and the _Iphigenia_ of Euripides from Greek into English.\r\nMost of her writings were dedicated to her father. Her manuscripts\r\nwere preserved in his library and so passed into royal possession\r\nin the time of James I. Another learned lady was Mary, Countess of\r\nArundel.[39] She translated from Greek and Latin and collected a book\r\nof similes from Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, and other classic authors.\r\nShe, too, dedicated her works to her father, Sir Thomas Arundel.\r\nSir Thomas Parr, \"following the example of Sir Thomas More and\r\nother great men,\" bestowed on his daughter Catherine[40] a learned\r\neducation, as \"the most valuable addition he could make to her other\r\ncharms.\" She was interested in all matters pertaining to learning,\r\nand successfully used her influence with the King in behalf of the\r\nuniversities. She wrote a letter in Latin to the Princess Mary to\r\ninduce her to translate Erasmus's _Paraphrase of St. John_, and wrote\r\nmany psalms, prayers, and meditations, beside _Queene Katherine\r\nParre's lamentation of a sinner_, published in 1548. Jane, Countess\r\nof Westmoreland, was placed by her father, the Earl of Surrey, under\r\nthe tuition of Mr. Fox, the Martyrologist, who reported her skill in\r\nLatin and Greek as such \"that she might well stand in competition\r\nwith the greatest men of that age.\"[41]\r\n\r\nMost interesting and most pathetic of all the young women known\r\nfor learning in Tudor times was Lady Jane Grey.[42] Ascham, in\r\na well-known passage in _The Scholemaster_ (1570), describes an\r\ninterview he had with her at Bradgate where she was pursuing her\r\nstudies under John Aylmer, her tutor. This was in 1550 when Lady Jane\r\nwas but thirteen.\r\n\r\n  Before I went into _Germanie_, I came to Brodegate in\r\n  Le(i)cestershire, to take my leaue of that noble Ladie _Iane\r\n  Grey_, to whom I was exeding moch beholdinge. Hir parentes,\r\n  the Duke and Duches, with all the houshold, Gentlemen and\r\n  Gentlewomen, were huntinge in the Parke; I founde her, in her\r\n  Chamber, readinge _Phædon Platonis_ in Greeke, and that with as\r\n  moch delite, as som ientlemen wold read a merie tale in _Bocase_.\r\n  After salutation, and dewtie done, with som other taulke, I asked\r\n  her, whie she wold leese soch pastime in the Parke! smiling\r\n  she answered me; I wisse, all their sporte in the Parke is but\r\n  a shoadoe to that pleasure, that I find in _Plato_: Alas good\r\n  folke, they neuer felt what trewe pleasure ment. And howe came\r\n  you Madame, quoth I, to this deepe knowledge of pleasure, and\r\n  what did chieflie allure you vnto it: seinge, not many women, but\r\n  verie fewe men haue attained thereunto. I will tell you, quoth\r\n  she, and to tell you a troth, which perchance ye will meruell\r\n  at. One of the greatest benefites, that euer God gaue me, is,\r\n  that he sent me so sharpe and seuere Parentes, and so ientle a\r\n  scholemaster. For when I am in the presence of either father or\r\n  mother, whether I speake, kepe silence, sit, stand, or go, eate,\r\n  drinke, be merie, or sad, be sowyng, plaiyng, dauncing, or doing\r\n  anie thing els, I most do it, as it were, in soch weight, mesure,\r\n  and number, euen so perfitelie, as God made the world, or else I\r\n  am so sharplie taunted, so cruellie threatened, yea presentlie\r\n  some tymes with pinches, nippes, and bobbes, and other waies,\r\n  which I will not name, for the honor I bear them, so without\r\n  measure mis-ordered, that I think my selfe in hell, till tyme\r\n  cum, that I must go to _M. Elmer_, who teacheth me so ientlie,\r\n  so pleasantlie, with soch faire allurements to learning, that\r\n  I thinke all the tyme nothing, whiles I am with him. And when\r\n  I am called from him, I fall on weeping because, what soeuer\r\n  I do els, but learning, is ful of grief, trouble, feare, and\r\n  whole misliking unto me: And thus my booke, hath bene so moch\r\n  my pleasure, and bringeth dayly to me more pleasure and more,\r\n  that in respect of it, all other pleasures, in vere deede be but\r\n  trifles and troubles vnto me. I remember this talke gladly, bothe\r\n  bicause it is so worthy of memorie, and bicause also, it was the\r\n  last talke that euer I had, and the last tyme, that euer I saw\r\n  that noble and worthie Ladie.\r\n\r\nMr. Elmer said she understood perfectly both kinds of philosophy,\r\nand could express herself very properly at least in the Latin and\r\nGreek tongues. Sir Thomas Chaloner said that she was \"well versed in\r\nHebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, French and Italian,\" that she \"played well\r\non instrumental music, writ a curious hand, and was excellent at\r\nher Needle.\" Ballard quotes a contemporaneous opinion that she was\r\nsuperior to King Edward VI in learning and in the languages. \"If her\r\nfortunes [says he] had been as good as her bringing up, joyned with\r\nfineness of wit: undoubtedly she might have seemed comparable not\r\nonly to the house of the Vespasians, Sempronians, and mother of the\r\nGracchies; yea, to any other women besides that deserveth high praise\r\nfor their singular learning; but also to the university men, which\r\nhave taken many degrees of the Schools.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as accessible records go it was only in royal or noble\r\nfamilies that a learned education was counted suitable for women. It\r\nis rare indeed to come upon an account like that of Elizabeth Lucar\r\n(1510-1537), the daughter of a Mr. Paul Withypoll, and the wife of a\r\nmerchant-tailor, Mr. Lucar. In her accomplishments she seems to have\r\nvied with the best ladies in the land. She was excellent in music,\r\nbeing able to play on the viol, the lute, and the virginal, and she\r\ncould sing in various tongues.\r\n\r\n      She wrought all Needle-works that Women exercise,\r\n      With Pen, Frame, or Stoole, all Pictures artificial,\r\n      Curious Knots, or Trailes, what fancy could devise,\r\n      Beasts, Birds, or Flowers, even as things natural.\r\n\r\nShe wrote \"three manner hands,\" was especially cunning in accounts\r\nand \"Algorism\" (Arithmetic), and she could speak, write, and\r\nread Latin, Spanish, and Italian, and she \"won the garland\" in\r\nEnglish.[43] Our knowledge of Elizabeth Withypoll's rare attainments\r\ncomes by chance from the information on her monument. Probably there\r\nwere other highly educated women in the wealthy middle classes but\r\ntheir learned tastes were not counted worthy of any definite record.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the many instances of girls trained in the best\r\nlearning of their times during the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, we have striking contemporary testimony as to the prevalence\r\nof the custom, and the high esteem in which such learning was held.\r\nRichard Mulcaster (1530-1611), first head-master of a school founded\r\nby the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1561, in discussing principles\r\nof education, expressed advanced ideas concerning the ability and\r\ntraining of girls.[44] He declared himself \"for them toothe and\r\nnaile.\" He says that their \"natural towardnesse\" is such that they\r\nshould be well brought up, and he summarizes the elements of this\r\ntraining. A young gentlewoman is thoroughly educated, he says, if she\r\ncan \"reade plainly, and distinctly, write faire and swiftly, sing\r\ncleare and sweetly, play wel and finely, understand and speak the\r\nlearned languages, and the tongues also which the time most embraseth\r\nwith some logicall helpe to chop, and some rhetoricke to brave.\" And\r\nhe asks whether it is likely that the children of a woman so trained\r\nwill be \"eare a whit the worse brought up\" for this learning. The\r\nplaces wherein girls may study may be at home with tutors or they may\r\ngo forth to the elementary school. And the teacher may be either a\r\nman or a woman. Mulcaster was himself in favor of sending girls to\r\nthe public grammar schools, and even to the universities, but he said\r\nit was \"a thing not used\" in his country, there was no \"president\"\r\ntherefor. But he is enthusiastic about the attainments of women.\r\nIn languages, he says, \"they compare favourably with our kinde in\r\nthe best degree.\" Some of them are so excellently trained and so\r\nrarely qualified that they could be preferred to \"the best Romaine\r\nor Greekish paragones be they never so much praised: to the Germaine\r\nor French gentlewymen by late writers so wel liked: to the Italian\r\nladies who dare write themselves and deserve fame for so doing.\"\r\n\r\nNicholas Udall, in 1548, in a Preface to Princess Mary's translation\r\nof the _Paraphrase of the Gospel of St. John_ by Erasmus, comments\r\non the great number of noble women at that time in England given not\r\nonly to human sciences and strange tongues, but\r\n\r\n  also so throughly expert in the Holy Scriptures that they were\r\n  able to compare with the best writers as well in enditeing and\r\n  penning of Godly and fruitful treatises to the instruction\r\n  and edifying of realmes in the knowledge of God, as also in\r\n  translating good books out of Latin or Greek into English....\r\n  It was now no news in England to see young damsels in noble\r\n  houses and in the courts of princes, instead of cards and other\r\n  instruments of idle trifling, to have continually in their hands\r\n  either psalms, homilies, or other devout meditations ... and\r\n  as familiarly both to read or reason thereof in Greek, Latin,\r\n  French or Italian, as in English. It was now a common thing to\r\n  see young virgins so trained in the study of good letters, that\r\n  they willingly set all other vain pastimes at naught for learning\r\n  sake. It was now no news at all, to see Queens and ladies of most\r\n  high estate and progeny, instead of courtly dalliance, to embrace\r\n  virtuous exercises of reading and writing, and with most earnest\r\n  study both early and late, to apply themselves to the acquiring\r\n  of knowledge.[45]\r\n\r\nPuttenham, in his _Arte of English Poesie_ (1589), indicates the\r\nprevalence of women poets in the sixteenth century when he says:\r\n\r\n  Darke word or doubtfull speach are not so narrowly to be looked\r\n  vpon in a large poeme, nor specially in the pretie Poesies and\r\n  deuises of Ladies and Gentlewomen-makers, whom we would not haue\r\n  too precise Poets least with their shrewd wits, when they were\r\n  maried they might become a little too fantasticall wiues.[46]\r\n\r\nOne of the influential foreign books of the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century was Baldasar Castiglione's _Il Cortegiano_, written\r\nin 1514, published in 1528, and translated into English in 1561 by\r\nThomas Hoby. The book is a conversation supposed to take place in the\r\ndrawing-room of the Duchess of Urbino, with the Duchess, her friend\r\nEmilia Pia, Pietro Bembo, Bernardo Bibbiena, Giuliano de Medici, and\r\nothers, among the speakers. In the chapter on the attributes of the\r\nperfect Court Lady, Count Gaspar Pallavicino says, \"Since you have\r\ngiven women letters and continence and magnanimity and temperance I\r\nonly marvel that you would not have them govern cities, make laws,\r\nand lead armies, and let the men stay at home to cook or spin.\"[47]\r\nGiuliano de Medici replies, laughing, \"Perhaps even that would not be\r\namiss.\" There follows a discussion of woman as essentially imperfect,\r\nan accident or mistake of nature, and consequently of less dignity\r\nthan men and not capable of those virtues to which men attain. But\r\nthe Magnifico held the doctrine that physical weakness does not\r\nconstitute inferiority, and that mentally women are equal to men:\r\n\"All the things that men can understand the same can women understand\r\ntoo; and where the intellect of the one penetrates there also can\r\nthat of the other penetrate.\"\r\n\r\nIt is but natural that the praise of learning for women should extend\r\nthrough the reign of Elizabeth. The Queen herself was an admirable\r\nlinguist. She spoke and wrote Latin with ease; she was a student\r\nof Plato, Aristotle, and Xenophon; and she made translations into\r\nEnglish from French and Italian, even translating from Latin into\r\nGreek. According to Ascham she read more Greek every day than some\r\nPrebendaries read Latin in a week, and bestowed more regular hours\r\non learning than six of the best given gentlemen in the court. It\r\nwas also in accordance with the ideals of the age that the Queen\r\nshould wish to shine as a poetess. Dyce, in his _Specimens of British\r\nPoetesses_, says that except for the speech of the Chorus in the\r\n_Hercules Acteus_ of Seneca (printed in Park's edition of Walpole's\r\n_Royal and Noble Authors_) he gives, and for the first time in\r\ncollected form, all the poems by this \"Flower of Troynovant.\" It is\r\nall occasional verse, such as a sonnet on that lovely \"daughter of\r\ndebate,\" Mary Queen of Scots, a _Rebus_, an _Epitaph_, and a few\r\nother stanzas. One little poem beginning\r\n\r\n      I grieve but dare not show my discontent,\r\n\r\nwith much that is conventional in expression, seems yet to have a\r\ngenuine note of personal feeling. Taken as a whole the brief sum of\r\nthe Queen's verse indicates no poetic aptitude. It merely goes to\r\nshow that verse writing was counted an agreeable accomplishment, and\r\none to be cultivated by a queen.\r\n\r\nProbably the most highly gifted woman during Elizabeth's reign\r\nwas Jane Weston (1582-1612).[48] And she was of high repute. When\r\nEvelyn went to dine with Lord Cornbury at Clarendon House (December\r\n20, 1668) to see the new house \"now bravely furnished, especially\r\nwith the pictures of most of our ancient and modern wits, poets,\r\nphilosophers, famous and learned Englishmen,\" he greatly commended\r\nhis lordship's collection, but suggested additional names of the\r\nlearned. Among these new names were Lady Jane Grey and Elizabeth\r\nJane Weston. In _Numismata_ Evelyn praised Jane Weston's Latin poem\r\non typography. Farnaby \"ranked her with Sir Thomas More and the best\r\nLatin poets of the day.\" She was reputed to speak and write English,\r\nGreek, German, Latin, Italian and Czech. John Philips praised her\r\nin his _Theatrum Poetarum_. \"Weston's fair daughter,\" \"the tenth\r\nmuse,\" \"the fourth grace,\" received, indeed, very high contemporary\r\nEnglish recognition, and even more extravagant praise came from\r\nforeign critics. Her collected works were published in 1602 by Georg\r\nMartin von Baldhoven at his own cost. At the end of the book there\r\nwas a list of learned women beginning with Deborah and ending with\r\nElizabeth Weston.\r\n\r\nThe only woman before 1603 in Aubrey's _Lives_, besides the Countess\r\nof Pembroke, was Elizabeth Danvers. His notes on her are: \"A great\r\npolitician; great witt and spirit, but revengefull. Knew how to\r\nmanage her estate as well as any man; understood jewells as well\r\nas any jeweller.\" He calls her \"an Italian,\" probably because she\r\nunderstood that language, and he says \"she had prodigious parts for a\r\nwoman.\" Her learning was certainly unusual, for \"she had Chaucer at\r\nher fingers' ends.\" The only date given for her is 1568, the year in\r\nwhich her son, Sir Charles Danvers, was born.[49]\r\n\r\nTo show that Scotland was not unrepresented, mention may be made of\r\nElizabeth Melville, supposed to be identical with Elizabeth Colville,\r\nLady Colville of Culross. In 1599 Alexander Hume dedicated to her his\r\n_Hymns_, or _Sacred Songs_, and he says of her: \"I know ye delite in\r\npoesie yourselfe; and as I vnfainedly confes, excelles any of your\r\nsexe in that art, that ever I heard within this nation. I have seene\r\nyour compositions so copious, so pregnant, so spirituall, that I\r\ndoubt not but it is the gift of God in you.\"[50] The one poem by\r\nwhich she is known, _Ane Godlie Dreame compylit in Scottish Meter by\r\nM. M. (Mistress Melville) Gentlewoman in Culross, at the request of\r\nher freindes_, was published in 1603. It appeared again in a volume\r\nof _Various Poetry_ in 1644, and in David Laing's _Early Metrical\r\nTales_ in 1826. Dyce gives a few stanzas in his _Specimens_. The poem\r\nis a Bunyan-like narrative in which the horrors of hell are painted\r\nwith a vigorous brush. In fact hell is made so distinct that even the\r\nmitigating and finally saving presence of Christ as guide can hardly\r\nsoften the pictures of \"puir damnit saullis ... frying wonder fast in\r\nflaming fire.\"[51]\r\n\r\nThe one lady of Elizabethan days whose fame justly exceeds that of\r\nany of her predecessors is Mary Sidney (1561-1621),[52] sister of\r\nSir Philip Sidney. At sixteen she married Henry Herbert, Earl of\r\nPembroke, and the twenty-four years of her married life were passed\r\nat his estate, Wilton House, in Wiltshire. Her brother Philip was\r\noften at Wilton and her more important literary accomplishments are\r\nclosely bound up with his work. It was at Wilton that he wrote _The\r\nCountess of Pembroke's Arcadia_ which he dedicated to his \"dear ladie\r\nand sister.\" The brother and sister translated together the whole\r\nbook of Psalms into English verse. Psalms 44-150 are attributed\r\nto Lady Pembroke. In 1592 she published two translations from the\r\nFrench, Du Plessis Mournay's _Le Excellent Discours de la Vie et de\r\nla Mort_; and Robert Garnier's _Marc Antonie_, a tragedy. Before 1600\r\nshe had also translated _The Triumph of Death_ from the Italian.\r\nIn 1593 she brought out her brother's _Arcadia_ on which she had\r\ndone most careful editorial work. She had also a taste for science.\r\nAubrey, in his _Brief Lives_, says of her: \"She was a great chymist,\r\nand spent yearly a great deale in that study.[53] She kept for her\r\nlaborator in the house Adrian Gilbert (vulgarly called Dr. Gilbert),\r\nhalf brother to Sir Walter Ralegh, who was a great chymist in those\r\ndayes.... She also gave an honourable pension to Dr. Thomas Mouffett,\r\nwho hath writ a booke _De insectis_. Also one ... Boston, a good\r\nchymist ... who did undoe himself by studying the philosopher's\r\nstone.\"\r\n\r\nBut while Lady Pembroke takes undoubtedly a high rank as translator\r\nand editor, her fame does not rest chiefly on this work. When\r\nNicholas Breton compared her to the Duchess of Urbino he brought\r\nforward her essential claim to distinction, which is that she\r\nunderstood, valued, and befriended the literati of her day. Aubrey\r\nsays: \"In her time Wilton House was like a College, there were so\r\nmany learned and ingeniose persons. She was the greatest patronesse\r\nof witt and learning of any lady in her time.\" The most extravagant\r\neulogies were addressed to her from girlhood to old age. No such\r\nchorus of praise had been accorded any other woman except the queen.\r\nBut it must be noted that this adulation is mainly for Lady Pembroke\r\nas the patroness of letters. Only incidentally are her own scholastic\r\nattainments commended. It was as a lover of wit and learning, as a\r\ndispenser of favors, that Lady Pembroke, the typical great lady of\r\nElizabethan days, expressed her interest in learning, rather than\r\nas herself a scholar; and it was as an intelligent and open-handed\r\npatroness that she received highest recognition.\r\n\r\nWotton, about a century later, gives the following summary of the\r\nlearning of this period: \"It was so very modish, that the fair Sex\r\nseemed to believe that _Greek_ and _Latin_ added to their Charms:\r\nand _Plato_ and _Aristotle_ untranslated, were frequent ornaments of\r\ntheir Closets. One would think by the Effects, that it was a proper\r\nWay of Educating of them, since there are no Accounts in History of\r\nso many truly great Women in any one age, as are to be found between\r\nthe years 15 and 1600.\"[54]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY SIDNEY, COUNTESS OF PEMBROKE\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in Horace Walpole's _Royal and Noble Authors_,\r\nLondon, 1806]\r\n\r\nThough Wotton counts the century as one period, a closer study of\r\ndates shows that most of the learned women of the century belong in\r\nthe first half of it, or at least obtained their education in the\r\nfirst half of it. The woman most noted for classical attainments\r\nduring Elizabeth's reign was Lady Bacon. Her sisters also were of\r\nconsiderable importance intellectually, and they lived well into the\r\nreign of Elizabeth. But their education and their establishment as\r\nwomen of exceptional learning belong before the coming of Elizabeth\r\nto the throne.\r\n\r\nMiss Weston's learning is unquestioned, but it can hardly be credited\r\nto England. She lived much abroad, her works were published in\r\nHolland, and the praise accorded her in England was but an echo of\r\nthe eulogies uttered by foreign critics. In spite of Queen Elizabeth\r\nand Lady Mary Sidney, and Lady Bacon and Jane Weston, it becomes\r\napparent by a study of dates and names that there were in Elizabeth's\r\nreign fewer eulogies of liberal education for girls and fewer records\r\nof women distinguished by learning than in the preceding period. In\r\npoint of fact, when we speak of the sixteenth century as a century of\r\nlearned women, the emphasis should be on the first sixty years of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PERIOD FROM 1603 TO 1650\r\n\r\nWith the death of Elizabeth we come practically to the end of the\r\nfavor accorded learned women. The changed tone of public opinion may\r\nbe fairly indicated by a few scattered utterances from contemporary\r\npoems and essays.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Overbury, in his _Characters_ (1614), describes \"A Good\r\nWoman\" as one \"whose husband's welfare is the business of her\r\nactions.\" Her chief virtue is that \"Shee is Hee.\" In _A Wife_ he says\r\nthat \"Books are a part of Man's Prerogative.\" He praises a \"passive\r\nunderstanding\" in women and deprecates learning since\r\n\r\n      What it finds malleable it maketh frail\r\n      And doth not add more ballast, but more sail.\r\n\r\nPowell, in _Tom of All Trades_ (1631), is emphatic in his plea\r\nfor the domestic as against the learned lady: \"Let them learne\r\nplaine workes of all kinds, so they take heed of too open seaming.\r\nInstead of Song and Musicke, let them learn Cookerie and Laundrie.\r\nAnd instead of reading in _Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia_, let them\r\nreade the grounds of good huswifery. I like not a female Poetresse\r\nat any hand.\"[55] William Habington, in _Castara_ (1634), a series\r\nof poems in honor of Lucy Herbert, his wife, gave a comprehensive\r\ndescription of the ideal wife's attitude towards her husband: \"Shee\r\nis inquisitive onely of new wayes to please him, and her wit sayles\r\nby no other compass then that of his direction. Shee lookes upon\r\nhim as Conjurers upon the Circle, beyond which there is nothing but\r\nDeath and Hell; and in him shee beleeves Paradice circumscrib'd. His\r\nvertues are her wonder and imitation; and his errors, her credulitie\r\nthinkes no more frailtie, then makes him descend to the title of\r\nMan.\"[56] Richard Brathwait, in _The English Gentleman_, comments\r\nwith apparent approval on the ancient seclusion of women. He says,\r\n\"_The Ægyptians_, by an especiall decree (as _Plutarch_ reports)\r\ninjoined their Women to weare no shooes, because they should abide\r\nat home. The _Grecians_ accustomed to burne, before the doore of the\r\nnew married, the axletree of that coach, wherein she was brought to\r\nher husbands house, letting her understand that she was ever after to\r\ndwell there.\"[57]\r\n\r\nSir Ralph Verney said of his own daughter: \"Pegg is very backward....\r\nI doubt not but she will be schollar enough for a Woeman.\" With\r\nregard to little Nancy Denton he wrote: \"Let not your girl learn\r\nLatin nor short hand: The difficulty of the first may keep her from\r\nthat vice, for soe I must esteem it in a woeman; but the easinesse\r\nof the other may be a prejudice to her; for the pride of taking\r\nsermon noates hath made multitudes of women unfortunate.\" Miss Nancy\r\nwas quite in advance of her godfather in her conception of the\r\nstudies appropriate for her. She wrote to him: \"I know you and my\r\ncoussenes wil out rech me in french, but i am a goeng whaar i hop\r\ni shal out rech you in ebri grek and laten.\" Sir Ralph answered:\r\n\"I did not think you had been guilty of soe much learning as I see\r\nyou are; and yet it seems you rest unsatisfied or else you would\r\nnot threaten Lattin, Greeke, and Hebrew too. Good sweet harte bee\r\nnot soe covitous; beleeve me a Bible (with y^e Common prayer) and a\r\ngood plaine cattichisme in your mother tongue being well read and\r\npractised, is well worth all the rest and much more sutable to your\r\nsex; I know your Father thinks thise false doctrine, but be confident\r\nyour husband will bee of my oppinion. In French you can not be too\r\ncunning for that language affords many admirable books fit for you\r\nas Romances, Plays, Poetry, Stories of illustrious (not learned)\r\nWoemen, receipts for preserving, makinge creames and all sorts of\r\ncookeryes, ordring your gardens and in Breif, all manner of good\r\nhousewifery.\"[58]\r\n\r\nThe general opinion was quite in accord with Luther when he said:\r\n\"Women should remain at home, sit still, keep house, and bear and\r\nbring up children\";[59] or, at the best, with Milton's \"He for God\r\nonly, she for God in him.\"[60]\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwyn, it is true, in 1619, in his _New Help to Discourse_,\r\npraises England as the place where women had the greatest\r\nprerogatives. In England, he says, women \"are not kept so severely\r\nsubmiss\" as in France, nor so jealously guarded as in Italy.\r\n\"England is termed by foreigners the Paradise of Women as it is by\r\nsome accounted the Hell of horses and the Purgatory of Servants.\r\nAnd it is a common byword among the Italians that if there were a\r\nbridge built over the narrow seas all women in Europe would run into\r\nEngland.\"[61] But this favorable opinion must be discounted as being\r\na retrospective estimate based mainly on the attitude towards women\r\nin the sixteenth century; and further, as being an Englishman's\r\nattempt to exalt English as against continental customs.\r\n\r\nOf more curious interest is the ingenious attempt of the Bishop of\r\nLondon to interpret the account of the creation of Eve from Adam's\r\nrib as an intention on the part of the Creator to teach the equality\r\nof woman with man. The Bishop says: \"The species of this bone is\r\nexprest to be _costa_, a rib, a bone of the side, not of the head: a\r\nwoman is not _domina_, the ruler; nor of any anterior part; she is\r\nnot _prælata_, preferred before the man; nor a bone of the foote;\r\nshe is not _serva_, a handmaid; nor of any hinder part; she is not\r\n_post-posita_, set behind the man; but a bone of the _side_, of a\r\nmiddle and indifferent part, to show that she is _socia_, a companion\r\nto her husband. For _qui jungunter lateribus, socii sunt_, they that\r\nwalke side to side, cheeke to cheeke, walke as companions.\"[62]\r\n\r\nOne book definitely in honor of the ladies came out rather late\r\nin the period. This was Charles Gerbier's _Elogium Heroinum. The\r\nLadies' Vindication: or, The Praise of Worthy Women._ The threefold\r\ndedication to the Princess of Bohemia, \"whose marvellous wisdom and\r\nprofound knowledge in Arts, Sciences, and Languages, is admired by\r\nall men,\" to the Countess Dowager of Claire, \"a Patroness of the\r\nMuses, a general Lover of the Languages, and Knowledge\"; and to the\r\n\"Vertuous Accomplisht Lady Anne Hudson,\" is justified by the three\r\nprinciples in natural philosophy, the three theological virtues,\r\nand the three graces. \"Woman,\" says Mr. Gerbier, \"is capable of\r\nas high improvement as man,\" an assertion which he proceeds to\r\nestablish by the following arguments: \"Does not _Sophia_ signify\r\nwisdom? Are not Faith, Hope and Charity represented as Women? Are not\r\nthe Seven Liberal Arts exprest in Women's Shapes? Are not the Nine\r\nMuses Daughters of Jupiter? Is not Wisdom called the Daughter of the\r\nHighest?\" His list of worthy women begins with the Queen of Sheba who\r\ndisputed with Solomon, goes enthusiastically through the famous dames\r\nof Greece and Rome, including the Muses and the Sibyls, and touches\r\nupon later learned women such as \"Christine de Pisan, Margaret of\r\nVallois, Lady Jane Grey, the Countess of Pembroke, the daughters of\r\nSir Anthony Cooke,\" and a few other outstanding personages of Tudor\r\ntimes. Praise so heterogeneous and uncritical was perhaps of little\r\nvalue, but such as it is, it stands alone in England in the period\r\nbetween Elizabeth and Charles II as a defense of learned women. And\r\nno defense or protest comes from the pen of a woman.\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be noted that in European countries women were\r\nmore vitally concerned in their own destinies. Between 1600 and 1641\r\nthere appeared at least three significant books by women dealing\r\nwith the intellectual emancipation of their sex. The earliest of\r\nthese came from Italy in 1608 with a second edition in 1621. It was\r\nwritten by a young Venetian widow, Lucrecia Marinelli (1571-1653),\r\nand was entitled _Della notabilità e della eccellenza delle donne\r\ne dei difetti degli uomini_. A second and better known book was by\r\nMarie de Jars, the _fille d'alliance_ of Montaigne, usually known as\r\nMlle. de Gournay.[63] Her book, entitled _L'Egalité des Hommes et des\r\nFemmes_, appeared in 1604 when \"the Pride of Gournay,\" \"the French\r\nSiren,\" as she was called, had become well known in the cultivated\r\ncircles of Paris through her definitive edition of Montaigne's\r\nworks in 1595. Mlle. de Gournay's thesis as to the dignity and\r\ncapacity of women is established by divine authority and by citations\r\nfrom the church fathers and ancient philosophers. She follows up\r\nthese expressions of opinion by a thorough résumé from sacred and\r\nprofane history of the women who have worthily held high places. M.\r\nFeugère[64] voices what must be the opinion of any modern reader\r\nwhen he says that _L'Egalité_ would be _plus piquant_ without the\r\npedantic form in which it is cast, without _les citations fréquentes\r\net les raisonnements scholastiques qui le surchargent_. But however\r\ncumbersome we may find her method, it apparently suited her public,\r\nfor the book was enthusiastically received.\r\n\r\nThe third and by far the most important book on the position and\r\ndesirable training of women was by Anna van Schurman of Utrecht.\r\nThe extremes to which Mlle. de Gournay carried her doctrines were\r\ndistasteful to Anna van Schurman, yet many of her ideas were\r\ndoubtless based on the work of her French predecessor, _la mère\r\ndu féminisme moderne_. Anna van Schurman's book was translated\r\ninto English and had a direct influence on the progress of English\r\neducational ideals for women. It is taken up in detail later in this\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe low estimate of learning, in the first half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, as an appropriate pursuit for women, had as its natural\r\noutcome a great decrease in the number of women who devoted\r\nthemselves to any form of scholarship. The names that remain to us\r\nfrom this period as in any way connected with literature or learning\r\nform a singularly inchoate list, interesting, for the most part,\r\nbecause of the oddities it represents rather than because of any\r\nsolid achievements. Of considerable importance are several ladies\r\nin the early years of the Stuarts who followed in the footsteps of\r\nLady Pembroke as patronesses of learning. The first of these was\r\nLady Bedford, who held her \"graceful and brilliant little court\"\r\nat Twickenham Park between 1608 and 1618. Daniel, Drayton, Donne,\r\nand Jonson were among those who celebrated her munificence. Though\r\nLady Bedford wrote verses she had no pronounced literary pursuits\r\nof her own. Her \"considerable and varied learning\" went preferably\r\nalong antiquarian and horticultural lines. She collected medals\r\nand pictures, and she designed a garden highly praised by Sir\r\nWilliam Temple. She is of importance chiefly because, in an age\r\nwhen learning lived only as it found patrons, she was magnificent\r\nin her hospitality to the poets.[65] Lady Mary Wroth was a niece\r\nof Lady Pembroke and carried on the traditional family attitude\r\ntowards poets. Jonson's _Alchemist_ (1610) was dedicated to her, and\r\nChapman's _Iliad_ (1614) had a prefatory sonnet addressed to her.\r\nShe wrote _The Countess of Montgomerie's Urania_ (1621), in four\r\nbooks, a work modeled on her uncle's _Arcadia_. A third patroness was\r\nElizabeth Spencer, wife of Sir George Carey. She was a kinswoman of\r\nEdmund Spenser and he commemorated her for \"the excellent favors\" she\r\nhad granted him.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable young women of the time of James I was\r\nElizabeth Jocelyn (1596-1622). She was brought up by her grandfather,\r\nWilliam Chaderton, Bishop of Lincoln. He was a friend of Sir\r\nAnthony Coke and Lord Burleigh and naturally shared their ideas as\r\nto education. The quick wit and remarkable memory of this little\r\ngranddaughter greatly pleased him and he took the utmost pains with\r\nher education, training her carefully in \"languages, history, and\r\nsome arts,\" but principally in \"studies of piety.\" She died nine days\r\nafter the birth of her first child to whom she left _The Mother's\r\nLegacie to her Unborne Childe_. The third edition came out in 1625,\r\nan incorrect impression in 1684, and a reprint of the 1625 edition in\r\n1852.[66] The little book contains a letter to her husband in which\r\nshe indicates her wishes in case the child should be a girl:\r\n\r\n  I desire her bringing up to bee learning the Bible, as my sisters\r\n  doe, good housewifery, writing and good workes: other learning a\r\n  woman needs not; though I admire it in those whom God hath blest\r\n  with discretion, yet I desired not so much in my owne, having\r\n  seene that sometimes women have greater portions of learning than\r\n  wisdome, which is of no better use to them than a main saile to a\r\n  flye-boat, which runs under water. But where learning and wisdom\r\n  meet in a vertuous disposed woman, she is the fittest closet of\r\n  all goodnesse. She is, indeed, I should but shame myself, if I\r\n  should goe about to praise her more. But, my dear, though she\r\n  have all this in her, she will hardly make a poore man's wife:\r\n  Yet I leave it to thy will. If thou desirest a learned daughter,\r\n  I pray God give her a wise and religious heart, that she may use\r\n  it to his glory, thy comfort, and her owne salvation.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the book is given up to cautions and plans for a\r\nboy's education. And for boy or girl there is great emphasis on\r\nreligion, on attending services, reading the Bible, and keeping up\r\nhabits of daily devotion. Of the prayers definitely recommended,\r\none for morning is one hundred and eighty lines, and one suitable\r\nfor all times is three hundred and fifty-nine lines. In the brief\r\nportion addressed directly to the girl, \"Devout Anna, Just Elizabeth,\r\nReligious Ester, and Chaste Susanna\" are held up as exemplars.\r\nSelf-effacement seems the chief duty enjoined on the girl: \"If\r\nthou beest a Daughter, remember thou art a Maid, and such ought\r\nthy modesty to bee, that thou shouldst scarce speak, but when thou\r\nanswerest.\" The book was deservedly popular because it was so genuine\r\nin its forecast of sorrow, so pathetically eager in plans and hopes\r\nfor her husband and child. No other work so personal and human in its\r\nappeal comes to light in this period.\r\n\r\nThere are during the first half of the century a few books by women\r\non practical subjects. They could hardly take rank as learned\r\nproductions, but they are significant as early attempts on the part\r\nof women to put into some sort of readable form, and to print for\r\nthe instruction of other women, the wisdom garnered through years of\r\nexperience. One of these books appeared in 1628 and was entitled _The\r\nCountess of Lincoln's Nurserie_.[67] The Countess was the mother\r\nof seven sons and nine daughters and wrote this little treatise\r\nparticularly for the guidance of her daughter-in-law Bridget. It\r\nis described as \"a well-wrote piece full of fine arguments, and\r\ncapable of convincing anyone that is capable of conviction, of the\r\nnecessity and advantages of mothers nursing their children.\" A\r\nsecond book transmitted information of another sort. Before 1651\r\nElizabeth Grey, Countess of Kent (1581-1651), the granddaughter of\r\nBess of Hardwick, wrote or compiled _A Choice Manuall, or Rare and\r\nSelect Receipts in Physick and Chyrurgery_. A second part, entitled\r\n_A True Gentlewoman's Delight Wherein is contained all manner of\r\nCookery_, reached its nineteenth edition in 1687. _The Legacie_,\r\nthe _Nurserie_, the _Choice Manuall_, were the direct outcome of\r\ninterests considered appropriate for women, and such publicity as\r\nthey involved would not be challenged.\r\n\r\nLetter-writing is also a realm ascribed without question to women,\r\nand when chance has rescued from oblivion any group of their letters,\r\nsocial history has been thereby enriched. The earliest Englishwoman,\r\nany large number of whose letters have been preserved and published,\r\nis Lady Brilliana Harley (1600-43) who wrote to her son Edward while\r\nhe was at Oxford in the years 1638-40. She was a woman of pronounced\r\nreligious and political opinions, observant, domestic, and with\r\na ready pen for picturesque detail, and her letters are of more\r\ninterest than most of the contemporary published work.[68]\r\n\r\nA few women have more directly to do with learning than those already\r\nmentioned. Occasionally in some great family Tudor traditions were\r\nmaintained. Margaret, Countess of Cumberland (1560-1616), for\r\ninstance, held to the idea that maidens of noble houses must be nobly\r\neducated, and she induced the poet Daniel to live at Skipton Castle\r\nas tutor to Anne, her nine-year-old daughter. Bishop Rainbow, who\r\nknew the family well, gives the following account of Anne:\r\n\r\n  She could discourse with virtuoso's, travellers, scholars,\r\n  merchants, divines, statesmen, and with good housewives in any\r\n  kind: insomuch that a prime and elegant wit, Dr. Donne, well seen\r\n  in all human learning ... is reported to have said of this lady,\r\n  in her younger years to this effect; that she knew well how to\r\n  discourse of all things from predestination to slea-silk. Meaning\r\n  that although she was skilful in her housewifery, and such things\r\n  in which women are conversant, yet her penetrating wit soared\r\n  up to pry into the highest mysteries, looking at the highest\r\n  example of female wisdom. Although she knew _Wool_ and _Flax_,\r\n  fine _Linen_ and _Silk_, things appertaining to the spindle and\r\n  the distaff: _yet she could open her mouth with wisdom_.... If\r\n  she had sought fame rather than wisdom, possibly she might have\r\n  been ranked among those wise and learned of her sex, of whom\r\n  _Pythagoras_ or _Plutarch_, or any of the ancients have made such\r\n  honourable mention.[69]\r\n\r\nA portrait of Anne at thirteen represents the books supposedly read\r\nby her under her tutor, Mr. Daniel, and her governess, Mrs. Ann\r\nTaylor, whose heads appear in the picture. The books are \"Eusebius,\r\nSt. Augustine, Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, Godfrey of Boulogne,\r\nThe French Academy, Cambden, Ortelius, and Agrippa on the Vanity of\r\nOccult Sciences.\"[70]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANNE CLIFFORD, COUNTESS OF DORSET, PEMBROKE AND\r\nMONTGOMERY\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in Pennant's _Tour in Scotland_, 1790, Part II]\r\n\r\nAt nineteen Anne married the Earl of Dorset. Her second marriage,\r\nin middle life, was to Philip Herbert, Fourth Earl of Pembroke and\r\nMontgomery. In alliance with these noble houses she was extremely\r\nunhappy. In her Journal she says: \"The marble pillars of Knowle in\r\nKent and Wilton in Wiltshire, were to me often times but the gay\r\narbor of anguish. A wise man, that knew the insides of my fortune,\r\nwould often say, that I lived in both these my lords' great families\r\nas the river Roan runs through the lake of Geneva, without mingling\r\nits streams with the lake; for I gave myself up to retiredness\r\nas much as I could and made good books and virtuous thoughts my\r\ncompanions.\"[71] A portrait, belonging to this period of middle life,\r\nindicates as the books then most favored, \"the Bible, Charron on\r\nWisdom and pious treatises.\" Lady Pembroke's pursuit of abstract\r\nand theological learning was, however, largely the outcome of her\r\nrepressed and unhappy life. On her second widowhood, in 1650, she\r\nforsook learning and gave free reign to her \"master-passion for\r\nbricks and mortar.\" But most of this energetic work, during which she\r\nrebuilt or restored her six castles and several churches, belongs\r\nafter the Restoration. As a woman of affairs Lady Pembroke made a\r\nremarkable impression on her age. Bishop Rainbow, who says she had\r\n\"a clear soul shining through a vivid body,\" emphasizes also \"her\r\ngreat understanding and judgment.\" Pennant, in his _Tour_, said\r\nthat she was regarded as \"the most eminent character of her times,\r\nfor intellectual accomplishments, for spirit, magnificence, and\r\nbenevolence.\"\r\n\r\nAnother lady who carried over into this period the liberal training\r\nof Tudor days was Elizabeth Tanfield (1585-1639), who, at the age of\r\nfifteen, married Henry Carey, later Viscount Falkland. Our knowledge\r\nof her very interesting life and character is derived mainly from a\r\n_Life_ written by one of her daughters. She was a lover of books from\r\nher childhood and learned languages--French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew,\r\nand Transylvanian--practically without a teacher. Her daughter said\r\nof her:\r\n\r\n  When she was but four or five years old they put her to learn\r\n  French, which she did about five weeks, and not profiting at all\r\n  gave it over; after, of herself, without a teacher, whilst she\r\n  was a child she learned French, Spanish and Italian; ... she\r\n  learned Latin in the same manner.... Hebrew she likewise, about\r\n  the same time, learned with very little teaching.... She then\r\n  learned also of a Transylvanian his language, but never finding\r\n  any use of it forgot it entirely. She read so incessantly at\r\n  night that her mother forbade the servants to give her candles.\r\n  But she bought candles at half a crown apiece of the servants and\r\n  at twelve was £100 in their debt, a debt which she paid on her\r\n  wedding day.\r\n\r\nHer work as an author began early, for her first play was written\r\nabout the time of her marriage. It was dedicated to her husband. A\r\nsecond play, _The Tragedy of Mariam the Faire Queene of Jewry_, was\r\nwritten when she was eighteen or nineteen, though not printed till\r\n1613.[72] She was early recognized as one of the most intellectual\r\nwomen of her time. In 1612 she was one of the three \"Glories of\r\nWomen\" to whom John Davies dedicated his _Muses Sacrifice_. Later, in\r\n1633, the publisher of Marston's Works dedicated them \"To the Right\r\nHonourable the Lady Elizabeth Carey, Viscountess Falkland,\" because\r\nshe was so \"well acquainted with the Muses.\" That Lady Falkland's\r\nappetite for learning never abated is apparent from her daughter's\r\ntestimony:\r\n\r\n  She had read very exceedingly much: poetry of all kinds ancient\r\n  and modern in several languages, all that ever she could meet;\r\n  history very universally, especially all ancient Greek and Roman\r\n  histories; all chronicles whatsoever of her own country, and\r\n  the French histories very thoroughly: of most other countries\r\n  something, though not so universally, of the ecclesiastical very\r\n  much, most especially concerning its chief pastors. Of books\r\n  treating of moral virtue or wisdom (such as Seneca, Plutarch's\r\n  _Morals_, and natural knowledge, as Pliny, and of late ones, such\r\n  as French, Mountaine, and English, Bacon) she had read very many\r\n  when she was young. Of the fathers and controversial writers on\r\n  both sides a great deal even of Luther and Calvin.[73]\r\n\r\nLady Falkland was converted to Catholicism in 1605 and she devoted\r\nall her learning to the service of the Church. She translated\r\nCardinal Perron's _Works_ and wrote lives of the saints in verse.\r\n\r\nLady Falkland's son Lucius married Letice Morrison, another \"undue\r\nlover of books,\" who abridged herself of sleep that the hours of\r\nreading might be prolonged. This daughter-in-law of Lady Falkland\r\nwas not only eager for learning, but she had independent views along\r\nsocial lines. One of her schemes was the foundation of houses \"for\r\nthe education of young gentlewomen and the retirement of widows with\r\nthe belief that through such houses learning and religion might\r\nflourish more than heretofore in her own sex.\" Her early death in the\r\ntime of the Civil War frustrated her plans, but they have an especial\r\ninterest as forecasting the ideas set forth by Mary Astell later in\r\nthe century.[74]\r\n\r\nAnna Hume, the daughter of David Hume, was carefully educated by her\r\nfather at Godscroft, a property to which he retired that he might be\r\nunmolested in his devotion to literature. Anna joined in his pursuits\r\nwith eagerness and intelligence, and after his death she did much\r\nto complete his work. In 1644 she superintended the publication\r\nof his _History of the House and Race of Douglas and Angus_. She\r\ntranslated Latin poems, and in 1644 she also published _The Triumph\r\nof Love, Chastity and Death_, translated from Petrarch. Drummond\r\nof Hawthornden speaks highly of her learning and of her \"rare and\r\npregnant wit.\"\r\n\r\nEsther Kello (1571-1624) is often spoken of as one of the notable\r\nwomen of the Stuart period. Her works were counted worthy gifts for\r\nkings, and are preserved in royal libraries. Calligraphy was one of\r\nthe fine arts in the seventeenth century. To write many different\r\nhands, to make flourishes, to decorate margins, to illuminate\r\ntitles and capital letters, to make elaborate head or tail pieces\r\nto chapters, and to write the alphabets of many languages, were\r\nthe elements of this art. No other accomplishment was so often\r\nadvertised.[75] It was in this art that Esther Kello excelled. _Les\r\nProverbes de Salomon_ (1599), written in forty hands, and with all\r\npossible ornamental detail, was one of her most famous books. It was\r\npreserved in \"Bodley's Library.\" In exactness, fineness, and beauty\r\nher books are said to rival the old illuminated manuscripts.[76]\r\n\r\nThere was published in 1630 a twelve-page tract entitled _A Chain\r\nof Pearl, or a Memorial of the Peerless Graces and heroic Virtues\r\nof Queen Elizabeth, of glorious memory, composed by the noble lady,\r\nDiana Primrose_. The Pearls of the Chain are Religion, Chastity,\r\nPrudence, Temperance, Clemency, Justice, Fortitude, Science,\r\nPatience, and Bounty. A preliminary address to the author by one\r\nDorothy Berry greets Diana as \"the _Prime-rose_ of the Muses nine.\"\r\nThe Pearls are in the style of exaggerated compliment always\r\nassociated with the name of Queen Elizabeth, but they could not have\r\nbeen inspired by any interested motives, for Elizabeth had been dead\r\nnearly a generation when they came from the press. Save the date of\r\npublication I have no facts about either Diana Primrose or Dorothy\r\nBerry. Perhaps their youth was spent during the \"blest and happy\r\nyears\" when the Heroine they praised was on the throne.\r\n\r\n      She, she it was that gave us golden days,\r\n      And did the English name to heaven raise.\r\n\r\nIf so, and if they wrote when trouble was brewing between the King\r\nand the people, we can well understand the ardor of Diana Primrose's\r\neulogy of the days when the Prince and People agreed \"in sacred\r\nconcord and sweet sympathy.\"\r\n\r\nA very curious book is by Mary Fage. It is entitled _Fame's Roule_\r\nand appeared in 1637.[77] It is a collection of the most ingenious\r\nanagrams and acrostics on the names of four hundred and twenty\r\npersons of the \"hopeful posterity\" of Charles I. John Weymes, for\r\ninstance, is anagrammed into \"Show men joy\" and John Hollis into \"Oh!\r\non my hills.\" The amplification of the anagram is mainly compliment\r\nwith now and then a trace of exhortation. This was an age when\r\nplaying with words gave undoubted pleasure, but four hundred and\r\ntwenty anagrams on royal names would seem an undue tax on even the\r\nmost agile manipulator of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nKatherine Chidley wrote and spoke on questions of Church and State.\r\nIn 1641 she published a quarto volume entitled _The Justification\r\nof the Independent Churches of Christ_, in which she maintained\r\nthat the congregations of the Saints should receive \"no direction\r\nin worship from any other than Christ their head and lawgiver.\" She\r\nis described as \"a most violent independent who talked with so much\r\nbitterness and with so clamorous a tongue as to vanquish opposing\r\ndivines, and who wrote as furiously in behalf of her cause as if she\r\nwere the Amazonian Queen in defence of the Trojans.\"\r\n\r\nA literary oddity of the Cromwell period, a fertile writer whose\r\nhalf-mad and often unintelligible prophetic writings yet came true\r\noften enough to secure her a troublesome reputation as a \"Cunning\r\nWoman,\" was Lady Eleanor Davies, the wife of Sir John Davies of\r\nHereford. She was twice married and both husbands had burned her\r\nmanuscripts, but finally, in 1651, there was printed a pamphlet, _The\r\nRestitution of Prophecy; that Buried Talent to be revived. By the\r\nLady Eleanor._[78] The Lady Eleanor was as devoted to anagrams as was\r\nMary Fage. The change of Eleanor Davies into \"Reveal O Daniel\" was\r\nher mystic authorization as a prophet, until some wit shattered her\r\nanagram by producing \"Never so mad a lady.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS BEFORE 1660\r\n\r\nOf schools for girls during the period before 1660 we get but vague\r\nhints. John Whitgift, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1583,\r\nprotested against having schools for \"maiden children\" within the\r\nprecincts of the church. And he added in a note, \"Especially seeing\r\nthey may have instruction by women in the town.\"[79] In the statutes\r\nof Harrow School, made in 1590, there is a statement to the effect\r\nthat \"no girls shall be received or taught,\" hence the subject had\r\nat least been under discussion.[80] _Love's Labour's Lost_ seems\r\nto indicate that Holofernes taught girls as well as boys,[81] and\r\nHelena comments on the \"school-days' friendship\" between her and\r\nHermia.[82] But these references belong to late Elizabethan times and\r\nare too indefinite to serve as evidence.\r\n\r\nThe best-known schools for girls in the first half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury were apparently religious in origin. One of these is the\r\n\"Institute\" founded by Mary Ward (1585-1645).[83] She was a brilliant\r\nand beautiful young Catholic who made it the aim of her life to\r\ninfluence young women to an acceptance of the Catholic faith. This\r\nshe endeavored to accomplish through educational agencies. It was\r\nher plan to have an organization of uncloistered nuns who should not\r\nwear habits, who should be free to come and go, and who should adapt\r\nthemselves in manner and dress to their surroundings in such ways as\r\nmight be most advisable in the pursuance of their spiritual aims.\r\nConditions in England made it useless to attempt such a school or\r\ncommunity there. So the first establishment of the Institute was at\r\nSt. Omer. This was in 1609. Five gentlewomen crossed the sea at that\r\ntime with Mary Ward. The one she loved and trusted most was Winifred\r\nWigmore, a descendant of the Throgmortons of Warwickshire, and so\r\nwell educated that she spoke five languages fluently. She had a keen\r\nintellect, was wise, sympathetic, courageous, and very devout. Mary\r\nPoyntz, \"gifted with all that can be most highly esteemed in person,\r\nbirth or fortune,\" the youngest of the group, was scarcely sixteen\r\nwhen she cast her lot in permanently with Mary Ward. Of Jane Browne,\r\nCatharine Smith, and Susanna Rookwood fewer details are given. Later\r\non Miss Ward was joined by Barbara Babthorpe, \"highly educated and\r\nvery well read ... with a striking gift of eloquence,\" and by her\r\nown sister Barbara Ward. Each of these ladies had a companion, so it\r\nwas quite a household that assembled at St. Omer, and they entered\r\nat once upon the life they had planned. They practiced rigid\r\nself-denial, living on one meal a day and sleeping on straw beds, and\r\nsubmitting themselves to other austerities. Their time was given over\r\nto good works, especially to education. They established a school for\r\nFrench and English girls, receiving the English girls as boarders.\r\nIn 1612 Miss Ward said that they had already received two nieces of\r\nthe Earl of Shrewsbury, and another young lady from the family of the\r\nEarl of Southampton, and that many Catholic nobles were planning to\r\nsend their daughters to be brought up in the Faith and good manners,\r\nby the ladies of St. Omer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY WARD\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in _The Life of Mary Ward_, by Mary Elizabeth\r\nChambers of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin]\r\n\r\nThe Institute finally received the sanction of the pope and was\r\nsuccessful in various countries. But Miss Ward's efforts to establish\r\nit in England in 1638 met with so much hostility that she was\r\nobliged to carry on her work secretly and by subterfuge, changing\r\nthe location of her little band of followers from time to time as\r\nsuspicion centered upon them. The Institute was finally broken up\r\nby the Puritans in 1642. Little is known of the actual work of the\r\nschool. The members of the Institute were always so anxious and\r\nharried that there could have been no really systematic instruction\r\nexcept in the articles of faith. There are in the Convent of the\r\nInstitute at Augsburg fifty large oil paintings dating from the\r\nseventeenth century, and representing events in its history. In these\r\npictures Mary Ward's life is seen to be one of dramatic interest from\r\nher childhood to her death. And her personality is one of compelling\r\ncharm. She was a heroine and a pioneer, an executive of first-rate\r\nability, an extremely acute woman of business, and yet without loss\r\nof the graces and amenities of human intercourse. The St. Omer school\r\nshows genius. Within the limits of her church she was promulgating\r\nideas the full fruition of which would not come for many years. She\r\nbelieved that sound mental training would establish women in their\r\nfaith, and that women, if given opportunity and education, would\r\nprove to have powers not generally ascribed to them. To establish a\r\nschool on this basis was an enterprise bolder, more original, and\r\nmore hazardous than was the opening of the first colleges for women\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nAnother religious school was that known as Little Gidding,[84]\r\nfounded by Nicholas Ferrar (1592-1637). The life of Ferrar is one\r\nof great interest. He was a man of wide experience. He had known\r\nacademic life at Cambridge, he had traveled in Holland, Germany,\r\nItaly, and Spain, he had conducted extensive business enterprises\r\nin connection with the Virginia Company, and had taken an important\r\nplace in political life as a member of Parliament. But while\r\nstill under forty he turned definitely to a life of religious\r\nsequestration. He and his mother bought the Manor of Little\r\nGidding in Huntingdonshire in 1624 and there they set up the new\r\nestablishment. He was joined by his brother John with his wife and\r\nthree children, and by Mrs. Collet, his favorite sister, with her\r\nhusband and sixteen children. To the children of these two families\r\nwere added such children of the neighboring gentry as cared to come.\r\nIn this household the girls were carefully educated. They had one\r\nmaster in Music, one in Arithmetic and Writing, one in English and\r\nLatin. They formed themselves into a little society called \"The\r\nAcademy\" which had regular meetings for discussion of topics set for\r\nthem. They took fanciful names, and had many quaint and elaborate\r\nlittle formalities. The topics discussed by \"Patient\" and \"Cheerful\"\r\nand \"Moderator\" and \"Visitor,\" and even by little four-year-old\r\n\"Humble,\" were nearly always religious or ethical, and the purpose\r\nof the discussions was always moral improvement. So strong was the\r\nreligious element, so rigid were the forms of fasting, feasting, and\r\nworshiping, that the school came under suspicion as a Protestant\r\nnunnery. In 1641 it was attacked in a pamphlet entitled _The Armenian\r\nNunnery, or a Brief Description and Relation of the newly erected\r\nMonasticall Place called the Armenian Nunnery at Little Gidding_.\r\n\r\nThe school at Little Gidding has had its fame as a religious\r\norganization perpetuated in Mr. Shorthouse's _John Inglesant_,\r\nbut it is even more famous in the annals of fine book-binding. It\r\nwas the belief of Nicholas Ferrar that every one should be taught\r\nsome hand-work, and he determined upon book-binding as a part of\r\nthe regular school work at Little Gidding. Dr. Jebb says that \"a\r\nCambridge book-binder's daughter that bound rarely\" was procured as\r\nan instructor. She came, he says, either from the University printers\r\nthemselves or from some Cambridge bindery which they patronized where\r\nshe herself had been trained. She brought some of her own stamps with\r\nher, and some of her own ideas as to how they should be arranged.\r\n\r\nEven this activity was the handmaid of religion, and was, indeed,\r\nprobably undertaken primarily in order to preserve the concordances\r\nof the four gospels so carefully worked out by Nicholas Ferrar.\r\nThe girls learned to do all the mechanical parts with extreme\r\nnicety, joining the many tiny slips and putting in the illustrative\r\nengravings with great deftness. The name of the binder is not usually\r\ngiven in the book, but there is one exception. A book bound by the\r\nyoungest of the workers bears the inscription:\r\n\r\n  Thanks be to God.\r\n  Done at Little Gidding. Anno Domino 1640\r\n  by Virginia Ferrar, an. 12.[85]\r\n\r\nThe curious little \"histories\" composed by \"The Academy\" were written\r\nout in three manuscript volumes and bound. They have been lately\r\nacquired by the British Museum. \"The volumes measure 13½ x 9 inches\r\nand are bound in black morocco, with a small double gold line running\r\nalong the edge, finished with a little ornamental spray at each\r\ncorner.\" The Concordances were more sumptuous. The _Bibliographica_\r\ngives full-page colored illustrations of these fine bindings and says\r\nof them:\r\n\r\n  The beautiful effect which Mary Collet, who seems to have done\r\n  much of the binding herself, was able to produce by different\r\n  arrangements of the stamps I have described shows that she was\r\n  undoubtedly a lady of much taste and originality ... and it may\r\n  fairly be considered that the velvet-bound volumes, of great\r\n  size, gorgeous in color and rich in decoration, which were\r\n  eventually produced under her supervision, must take the highest\r\n  rank among amateur decorative book-bindings.\r\n\r\n  Unequalled in size, original in design, and rich in execution,\r\n  these volumes must be seen to be appreciated; then indeed the\r\n  expressions which Charles I used concerning them, which sound\r\n  extravagant, can be well understood. Although much faded, and\r\n  sometimes re-backed and the sides relaid, with the silken ties\r\n  all gone, enough of their old magnificence still remains to make\r\n  us feel that we should indeed be proud that English binders could\r\n  have produced such works.[86]\r\n\r\nAside from these religious schools, which were very small, there were\r\nundoubtedly some fashionable boarding-schools, such as Mrs. Salmon's\r\nschool in Hackney where Katherine Fowler went.[87] Another fully\r\norganized private school at Hackney was that kept by Mrs. Perwick in\r\n1643, where as many as eight hundred girls had been educated.[88] The\r\nexistence of a school for girls in Richmond is shown by a curious\r\ndocument found among a large number of miscellaneous papers in\r\nWarwickshire. It is entitled \"Account for Peggy's Disbursements since\r\nher going to schoole at Richmond, being in Sept. 1646\":\r\n\r\n                                                              _s. d._\r\n\r\n  Payd for a louehood                                          2. 6\r\n\r\n  For carriing the truncke to Queenhive                        0. 8\r\n\r\n  For carriing it to Hammersmith                               1. 0\r\n\r\n  Payd for two pair of shoes                                   4. 0\r\n\r\n  Payd for a singing booke                                     1. 0\r\n\r\n  Given to M^{rsis} Jervoises mayd                             1. 0\r\n\r\n  Payed for a hairlace and a pair of showstrings               1. 0\r\n\r\n  For an inckhorne                                             0. 4\r\n\r\n  For faggots. 2_s._8_d._; and cleaving of wood, _12d._        3. 8\r\n\r\n  For 9^{li} of soape 2_s._ 4_d._; and starch 4_d._            2. 8\r\n\r\n  For hooks and a bolte for the doore                          0. 9\r\n\r\n  For sugar and licorich                                       1. 4\r\n\r\n  For silke and thread                                         0. 6\r\n\r\n  For 3^{li} of soape, 11_d._; and starch 4_d._; and carrying\r\n  letters 6_d._                                                1. 9\r\n\r\n  For 3^{li} of soape, 12_d._; and starch 4_d._                1. 4\r\n\r\n  For sugar, licorich and coultsfoot                           1. 6\r\n\r\n  For a necklace, 12_d._; for a m. of pins, 12_d._             2. 0\r\n\r\n  For a pair of cands (candles?) 6_d._; for muckadine 4_d._;\r\n  for wormsend (worsted), 2_d._                                1. 0\r\n\r\n  For shostrings, 6_d._; for going on errands, 6_d._           1. 0\r\n\r\n  For 3^{li} of soape, 12_d._; for starch 4_d._; thread and\r\n  silk 4_d._                                                   1. 8\r\n\r\n  For a bason, 4_d._; for carrying letters, 6_d._; for\r\n  tape 4_d._                                                   1. 2\r\n\r\n  For soape, 12_d._; for starch, 4_d._; for going on errands,\r\n  6_d._                                                        1.10\r\n\r\n  For a pair of pattins, 16_d._; for three pair of shoes,\r\n  6_s._                                                        7. 4\r\n\r\n  For callico to line her stockins, 2_d._; for showstrings\r\n  4_d._                                                        0. 6\r\n\r\n  For 3^{li} of soape, 12d.; for a pint of white wine 4d.      1. 4\r\n\r\n  For ale, 3_d._; for 1/2^{li} of sugar, 8_d._                 0.11\r\n\r\n  For a m. of pins, 12_d._; for a corle and one pair of\r\n  half-handed gloves, 8_d._                                    1. 8\r\n\r\n  Given to the writing mr.                                     2. 6\r\n\r\n  For silke, 12_d._; for silver for the tooth-pick case,\r\n  4_d._                                                        1. 4\r\n\r\n  For a sampler, 12_d._; for thread, needles,\r\n  paper, pins, and parchment, 30_d._                           3. 6\r\n\r\n  For a pair of shoes, 2_s._ 2_d._; for ribbon, 3_d._          2. 5\r\n\r\n  For soape, 12_d._; for starch, 4_d._; for carriing a letter,\r\n  4_d._                                                        1. 8\r\n\r\n  To the waterman bringing the (box?) to Richmond              1. 0\r\n\r\n  For shoestrings, 6_d._; for purge, 18_d._                    2. 0\r\n\r\n  For bringing the box from Richmond                           1. 0\r\n\r\n  For a coach from Fleetestreete                               1. 0\r\n\r\n  For wood to this time                                       15.10\r\n                                                             ------\r\n  Totall of disbursements to this 15th day of Aprill, 1647\r\n  is                                                       £3.18.5[89]\r\n\r\nPeggy's clothing and her board and tuition must have been paid for\r\nby her father. The accurate little list represents only her personal\r\nand incidental expenses. The writing-master's fee, the purchase of an\r\ninkhorn, a singing-book, and materials for a sampler are the only\r\nsuggestions that Peggy was being educated. But several of the items\r\nare indicative of general school conditions. For instance, if a girl\r\nhad a fire she evidently had to pay extra for it, Peggy's largest\r\nsingle item being for wood, \"cleaving of wood,\" and \"faggotts.\" The\r\nnext largest sum goes for \"soape\" and starch. Peggy apparently did\r\nher own laundry, or at least bought the materials used; and she\r\nbought them in amounts suggestive of disproportionate emphasis on\r\nclean linen. In clothing the most surprising purchase is of six pairs\r\nof shoes and one pair of \"pattins\" in six months. It is a pity we\r\nhave not the letters for the carrying of which Peggy paid ten pence.\r\nThey might serve to throw light on her expense account.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1649, Evelyn records in his _Diary_, \"Went to Putney by\r\nwater, in the barge with divers ladies, to see the schools, or\r\nColleges, of the young gentlewomen.\" These Putney schools may have\r\nbeen under the charge of Mrs. Makin. In that case they were the\r\nforerunners of the more advanced school she established at Tottenham\r\nHigh Cross in 1673.\r\n\r\nOne interesting point occurs in the foundation of a school for boys\r\nby Balthasar Gerbier in 1648. This school was an academy wherein\r\nthe sons of noble families could be taught classics, mathematics,\r\ndrawing, painting, carving, music, behavior, etc. The novel element\r\nin the school is Gerbier's advertisement December 21, 1649, in which\r\nhe says that ladies are to be admitted to his lectures.[90]\r\n\r\nIf girls were educated at all during the period from 1603 to 1660\r\nit must have been, in the main, at home under parents and tutors.\r\nBut even of such education the records are meager. Little Gidding\r\nwas practically a home school, but it stands as an isolated attempt.\r\nThe few little pictures of more secular home education that have\r\nbeen by chance preserved to us indicate no very valuable training.\r\nMrs. Alice Thornton (1626-1707), Lady Anne, daughter of the Earl of\r\nStrafford, and Lady Arabella Wentworth, were brought up in Ireland\r\nand were given \"the best education that Kingdome could afford.\" They\r\nwere taught to write and speak French; singing, dancing, playing on\r\nthe lute and theorboe, and such other accomplishments as \"working\r\nsilkes, gummework, sweetmeats, and other sutable huswifery\" such as\r\nwas necessary for girls of their social position.[91]\r\n\r\nWe get some further light from autobiographical sketches by the\r\nDuchess of Newcastle,[92] Lady Fanshawe,[93] and Mrs. Hutchinson,[94]\r\nwomen whose mature work belongs in the Restoration period or not many\r\nyears before it, but whose childhood and early youth belong in the\r\nperiod under consideration, and serve in a measure to illustrate its\r\nmethods. The educational advantages afforded these young daughters\r\nof the best families were like those of an eighteenth-century\r\nfinishing-school, and were far removed from the stern mental\r\ndiscipline in the school of Sir Thomas More.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nLEARNED LADIES IN ENGLAND FROM 1650 TO 1760\r\n\r\n\r\n1. AN INTRODUCTORY GROUP IN THE YEARS 1650-1675\r\n\r\nThe brief running summaries in the preceding chapter have perhaps\r\nserved to bring into prominence two sharply contrasted periods.\r\nThe first half of the sixteenth century and the first half of the\r\nseventeenth seem even more than a hundred years apart in tone and\r\ntemper. We turn from the eager intellectual life of many women in the\r\nTudor period, from their full and rich opportunities, and we find\r\nthat in the time of the earlier Stuarts there were very few women who\r\ntook any pride in learning, that there was little or no provision at\r\nhome or in schools for any but the most desultory sort of education\r\nfor girls, and that there were practically no formulated ideals or\r\ntheories of intellectual advancement for women. But at the close of\r\nthis barren half-century we come upon what may be considered the real\r\nbeginnings of the modern work of women. This era of development may\r\nbe appropriately introduced by the presentation of several women who,\r\nwhile in no sense cohering into a group, are yet alike in that their\r\nhome education belongs in the reign of Charles I, that later they had\r\nthe stern training incident on Civil War conditions, and that their\r\npublished work belongs before 1675.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margaret Lucas, the Duchess of Newcastle (1624-1674)]\r\n\r\nThe most talked-of learned lady of the Restoration period was the\r\nDuchess of Newcastle.[95] She was brought up by her mother, who was\r\nleft a widow with a great fortune and a family of eight children when\r\nMargaret was an infant. The Duchess in her _Autobiography_ describes\r\na family life conducted with splendor and luxury. She comments\r\non the elaborate attendance, the rich and costly garments, the many\r\npleasures, secured for the children by the industrious care and\r\ntender love of their mother. It was a bright, gay, free, affectionate\r\nhome life. But we get only slight indications of any educational\r\nadvantages. \"As for tutors, although we had for all sorts of vertues,\r\nas singing, dancing, playing on musick, reading, writing, working,\r\nand the like, yet we were not kept strictly thereto, they were rather\r\nfor formality than benefit, for my Mother cared not so much for our\r\ndancing and fidling, singing and prating of severall languages, as\r\nthat we should be bred virtuously, modestly, civilly, honourably and\r\non honest principles.\" None of these opportunities met Margaret's\r\nneeds. She says she had a natural stupidity in learning foreign\r\ntongues, cared little for music, disliked needlework, found cards\r\nand games tiresome, and dancing frivolous. Apparently the freedom\r\nof the family life left her at liberty to follow her real interests\r\nwhich were in the main intellectual. Here she had the sympathetic\r\naid of her brother, Lord Lucas. The precocious development of her\r\nmind is shown by the fact that at twelve she had written a book on a\r\nphilosophical subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARGARET CAVENDISH, DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in Horace Walpole's _Royal and Noble Authors_,\r\nLondon, 1806]\r\n\r\nAt eighteen she was appointed maid of honor to Queen Henrietta Maria\r\nand accompanied her to France. There, at twenty, she became the\r\nsecond wife of the Duke of Newcastle, a nobleman thirty-two years\r\nolder than herself, but who was, she says, \"the onely Person I ever\r\nwas in love with.\" She was with him during the trying years of his\r\nabsence from England and it was during this difficult and tedious\r\nperiod that literature became her resource. Her publications began\r\nwith _Philosophical Fancies_ in 1653 and closed with _Grounds of\r\nNatural Philosophy_ in 1668, during which period she wrote nearly\r\ntwelve folio volumes. The portions of her work concerning which she\r\nfelt the greatest measure of self-congratulation were her studies in\r\nnatural philosophy. Her _Philosophical Fancies_ of 1653 was expanded\r\nin 1655, and in 1663 received its final form as _Philosophical and\r\nPhysical Opinions_. Of all her books this was \"her best beloved and\r\nfavourite.\" But the quality on which she chiefly prides herself is\r\nthe very one that nullifies her work. Originality is her great boast,\r\nan originality so pronounced as to refuse to base its deductions on\r\nthe writings of previous thinkers. Her husband substantiates her\r\nclaim. He says that all her philosophical fancies are spun out of\r\nher own brain, and that, if she does not use the technical terms of\r\nphilosophers, it is because her language is her own too. She has\r\nscorned to talk with any \"profest scholar\" to learn his phraseology.\r\n\"She did never impe her high-flying Phancies, with any old broken\r\nFethers out of any university.\"[96] She says herself that she could\r\nnever \"afford board-room to other people's ideas lest the legitimate\r\noffspring of her own brain should be crowded out.\"[97] In Part IV,\r\n\"On the Motion of the Bodie,\" we find that the Duchess has never\r\nstudied anatomy, but this apparent disqualification does not prove\r\ninhibitory. In _An Epistle to the Reader_ she explains the situation:\r\n\r\n  I am to be pardoned, if I have not the names and tearms that\r\n  the Anatomists have or use; or if I have mistaken some parts in\r\n  the body, or misplaced any: for truly I never read of Anatomie,\r\n  nor never saw any man opened, much less dissected, which for my\r\n  better understanding I would have done; but I found that neither\r\n  the caurage of nature, nor the modesty of my sex would permit\r\n  me. Werefore it would be a great chance, even to a wonder I\r\n  should not erre in some; but I have seen the intrals of beasts,\r\n  but never as they are placed in their bodies, but as they are\r\n  cut out to be drest ... which intrals I have heard are much like\r\n  mans, especially a hogs, so that I know man hath a brain, a\r\n  heart, a stomach, liver, lights, spleen, and the like; yet these\r\n  I never viewed with a curious and searching eye, but as they\r\n  have laien in some vessels; and as for bones, nerves, muscels,\r\n  veines and the like, I know not how they are placed in the body,\r\n  but as I have gathered several times from several relations, or\r\n  discourses: here a bit and there a crum of knowledge, which my\r\n  natural reason hath put together.[98]\r\n\r\nFrom any modern standpoint of scientific excellence the inaccuracy\r\nand amazing self-confidence of these studies render them worse than\r\nfutile. But it was not ignorance that was charged against the Duchess\r\nby her critics. The experimental method was having its triumphs, but\r\ndoubtless a good deal of the scientific writing of the first half\r\nof the century was marked by a dogmatic tone and an uncertainty as\r\nto facts, so the Duchess was not attacked on that score. The common\r\nreport that irritated the Duke of Newcastle to a spirited defense of\r\nhis wife was that she could not have written these books, for \"no\r\nlady could understand so many hard words.\" The Duke takes up various\r\nkinds of hard words such as terms of divinity, philosophy, astronomy,\r\nand geometry, and shows that natural wit, common sense, and some\r\nobservation could compass most of them. He gives the following\r\naccount of the way he and the Duchess acquired a medical vocabulary:\r\n\"But would you know the great Mystery of these Physical terms, I am\r\nalmost ashamed to tell you; not that we have been ever sickly, but\r\nby melancholy often supposed ourselves to have such diseases as we\r\nhad not, and learned Physitians were too wise to put us out of that\r\nhumour, and so these terms cost us much more than they are worth, and\r\nI hope there is nobody so malicious as to envie us our bargain.\"[99]\r\nAt the end of his Preface the Duke comes to what he considers the\r\nreal cause of the aspersions on his Lady's books: \"But here's the\r\ncrime, a Lady writes them, and to intrench so much on the male\r\nprerogative, is not to be forgiven.\" The Duchess, in her _Address to\r\nthe Two Universities_, recurs to this idea. She hopes her book may be\r\nreceived\r\n\r\n  for the good incouragement of our sex, lest in time we should\r\n  grow irrational as idiots, by the dejectednesse of our spirits,\r\n  through the carelesse neglects, and despisements of the masculine\r\n  sex to the effeminate, thinking it impossible we should have\r\n  either learning or understanding, wit or judgement, as if we\r\n  had not rational souls as well as men, and we out of a custom\r\n  of dejectedness think so too, which makes us quit all industry\r\n  towards profitable knowledge ... so as we are become like worms\r\n  that only live in the dull earth of ignorance, winding ourselves\r\n  sometimes out, by the help of some refreshing rain of good\r\n  educations which seldom is given us; for we are kept like birds\r\n  in cages to hop up and down in our houses ... we are shut out of\r\n  all power, and Authority by reason we are never imployed either\r\n  in civil nor marshall affaires, our counsels are despised, and\r\n  laught at, the best of our actions are troden down with scorn,\r\n  by the over-weaning conceit men have of themselves and through a\r\n  despisement of us.[100]\r\n\r\nBut she presents her book with some confidence to the universities as\r\nplaces where are to be found right judgment and respectful civility.\r\nAnd at any rate she would rather \"lie intombed under the dust of an\r\nUniversity\" than be \"worshipped by the Vulgar as a Deity.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the Duchess's most curious books is _Orations of Divers Sorts\r\naccommodated to Divers Places_. Among the \"orations\" is a \"collection\r\nof speeches for a convivial meeting of country gentlemen in a market\r\ntown, ending with 'a speech of a quarter-drunk gentleman,' and 'a\r\nspeech of a half-drunk gentleman.' Another little collection headed\r\n'Female Orations' reports the speeches delivered at a meeting of\r\nwomen on the great question of combining together to make themselves\r\n'as free, happy, and famous as men.'\"[101]\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke and Duchess returned to England after the Restoration\r\nthey lived for the most part at one of their country estates,\r\nbut they made occasional visits to London. It was then that the\r\nDuchess's beauty, wealth, eccentric dress and manners, and literary\r\nand scientific pretensions made her a conspicuous and, to some, a\r\nridiculous figure. Sir Walter Scott, in _Peveril of the Peak_,[102]\r\nmakes Charles II say of the Duchess, \"Her Grace is an entire\r\nraree-show in her own person--a universal masquerade--indeed a sort\r\nof private Bedlam hospital\"; and this sums up the attitude that found\r\nexpression in the phrase, \"Mad Madge of Newcastle.\" In 1653 Dorothy\r\nOsborne wrote to Sir William Temple: \"Let me ask you if you have\r\nseen a book of poems newly come out, made by my Lady Newcastle? For\r\nGod's sake if you meet with it send it to me; they say 't is ten\r\ntimes more extravagant than her dress. Sure, the poor woman is a\r\nlittle distracted, she could never be so ridiculous as to venture at\r\nwriting books, and in verse too.\" A little later she wrote: \"You need\r\nnot send me Lady Newcastle's book at all, for I have seen it, and am\r\nsatisfied that there are many soberer people in Bedlam.\"[103] Mrs.\r\nEvelyn called on the Duchess in 1667 and wrote to Mr. Bohun:\r\n\r\n  I was surprised to find so much extravagancy and vanity in any\r\n  person not confined within four walls. Her habit particular,\r\n  fantastical, not unbecoming a good shape, which truly she may\r\n  boast of. Her face discovers the facility of her sex, in being\r\n  yet persuaded it deserves the esteem years forbid, by the\r\n  infinite care she takes to place her curls and patches. Her mein\r\n  surpasses the imagination of poets, or the descriptions of a\r\n  romance heroine's greatness: her gracious bows, seasonable nods,\r\n  courteous stretching out of her hands, twinkling of her eyes, and\r\n  various gestures of approbation, show what may be expected from\r\n  her discourse, which is as airy, empty, whimsical and rambling\r\n  as her books, aiming at science difficulties, high notions,\r\n  terminating commonly in nonsense, oaths, and obscenity.[104]\r\n\r\nOn May 30, 1667, the Duchess made a formal visit to the Royal\r\nSociety, and Pepys says she was all admiration at the fine\r\nexperiments they showed her, but he did not hear her say anything\r\nthat was worth hearing. There had been much objection to admitting\r\nher to the rooms of the Society, some of the members fearing that the\r\ntown would be \"full of ballads of it,\" but the visit seems to have\r\npassed off mildly and with the respectful observance to which she was\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARGARET CAVENDISH, DUCHESS OF NEWCASTLE\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in _The Lives of William Cavendish, Duke of\r\nNewcastle, and of his wife Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle_, edited by\r\nMark Antony Lower, London, 1872]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the stream of private criticism already indicated, the\r\nalmost unmixed adulation of which the Duchess was the subject is\r\nindicated by the _Letters and Poems, in Honour of the incomparable\r\nPrincess Margaret, Dutchess of Newcastle_, published in 1676, two\r\nyears after her death. In her lifetime, too, the praise was equally\r\nextravagant. Resounding Latin titles, such as _Illustrissima\r\nHeroina_, _Excellentissima Dux_, _Eminentissima Princeps_, came to\r\nher from high sources. The Rector Magnificus of the University of\r\nLeyden called her not only _Princeps fæminini sexus_, but _Princeps\r\nterrarum_. And the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge in a complimentary\r\naddress said that the great women of old could not contend with her\r\nfor the palm of learning, but rather would they, with bent knee,\r\nadore this _solam Margaretam Consumatissimam Principem_. Even so sane\r\na man as Evelyn wrote her a most flattering letter when she sent him\r\nher works in 1674. Beginning with Zenobia he assembled the great\r\nwomen of ancient times, the learned ladies of more modern days in\r\nFrance, Spain, Italy, and Holland, and concluded with\r\n\r\n  Mary de Gournay, & the famous Anna M. Schurman: and of our owne\r\n  country, Queene Elizabeth, Queene Jane, the Lady Weston, Mrs.\r\n  Philips our late Orinda, the daughters of S^r Tho: More; the\r\n  Queene Christina of Sweden, & Elizabeth, daughter of a queen also\r\n  to whom the renowned Des Cartes dedicated his learned worke, &\r\n  the profound researches of his extraordinary talent. But all\r\n  these, I say, sum'd together, possesse but that divided, which\r\n  yr Grace retaines in one; so as Lucretia Marinella, who writ a\r\n  book (in 1601) _dell' Excellenzia delle Donne, con difetti è\r\n  mancamenti de gli huomini_, had no neede to have assembled so\r\n  many instances and arguments to adorne the work, had she lived\r\n  to be witnesse of Margarite, Dutchess of Newcastle, to have read\r\n  her writings, & to have heard her discourse of the science she\r\n  comprehended.[105]\r\n\r\nPraise could hardly go further.\r\n\r\nThe best modern judgment discards the encomiums, but yet gives the\r\nDuchess a fairly high place. Sir Egerton Brydges, the editor of her\r\n_Autobiography_, says:\r\n\r\n  That the Duchess was deficient in a cultivated judgment; that\r\n  her knowledge was more multifarious than exact; and that her\r\n  powers of fancy and sentiment were more active than her powers\r\n  of reasoning, I will admit; but that her productions, mingled as\r\n  they are with great absurdities, are wanting either in talent or\r\n  in virtue, or even genius, I cannot concede.[106]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was buried in Westminster Abbey with this inscription on\r\nher monument:\r\n\r\n  Here lies the loyal Duke of Newcastle and his Duchess, his second\r\n  wife, by whom he had no issue. Her name was Margaret Lucas,\r\n  youngest sister to Lord Lucas of Colchester, a noble family, for\r\n  all the brothers were valliant, and all the sisters virtuous.\r\n  This Duchess was a wise, witty, and learned Lady, which her many\r\n  books do well testify; She was a most virtuous, and loving,\r\n  and careful wife, and was with her Lord all the time of his\r\n  banishment and miseries; and when they came home never parted\r\n  with him in his solitary retirements.\r\n\r\nThe two books by the Duchess that one would not willingly let die\r\nare her _Life_ of her husband and her _Autobiography_. These are\r\nof permanent value as pictures of the life of a great, rich family\r\nlike that of her girlhood home, and the straitened life in exile,\r\nwith the later affluent and splendid life of a noble high in royal\r\nfavor such as was the Duke of Newcastle. All the personal portions of\r\nboth books are told with an air of genuineness, a naïveté, that make\r\ndelightful reading. The Duchess summed up her life as that of a woman\r\n\"honourably born, carefully bred, and nobly married to a wise man,\"\r\nand it was out of these happy domestic relations that her best work\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Katherine Philips (1631-1664)]\r\n\r\nContemporary with the Duchess of Newcastle was Katherine Fowler,\r\nbetter known as Mrs. Katherine Philips, and better still as the\r\n\"Matchless Orinda.\" She was the daughter of John Fowler, \"an eminent\r\nmerchant in Bucklersbury,\" and Katherine Oxenbridge. Aubrey gives a\r\nquaint account of her precocious childhood as it was described to him\r\nby \"her cosen Blacket who lived with her from her swadling cloutes\r\ntill eight, and taught her to read.\" Aubrey says: \"When a child she\r\nwas mighty apt to learn, and ... she had read the Bible through\r\nbefore she was full four yeares old; she could have sayed I know not\r\nhow many places of Scripture and Chapters. She was a frequent hearer\r\nof sermons; had an excellent memory and could have brought away a\r\nsermon in her memory.\"[107]\r\n\r\nHer further education was carried on at Hackney at the school of\r\n\"Mris Salmon, a famous schoolmistress, Presbyterian.... Loved poetrey\r\nat schoole, and made verses there. She takes after her grandmother\r\nOxenbridge ... who was an acquaintance of Mr. Francis Quarles, being\r\nmuch inclined to poetrie herself.\" As a child Katherine evidently was\r\nas ardent a Presbyterian as her school-mistress and her Oxenbridge\r\nancestors. \"She was very religiously devoted when she was young;\r\nprayed by herself an hower together, and tooke sermons verbatim when\r\nshe was but ten yeares old.... She was when a child much against\r\nthe bishops, prayd to God to take them to him, but afterwards was\r\nreconciled to them. Prayed aloud, as the hypocritical fashion then\r\nwas, and was overheared.\"\r\n\r\nAt sixteen she married Mr. James Philips, Esquire, of Cardigan\r\nPriory, Wales. Her published work includes numerous brief poems,\r\nmost of them of a personal nature, two plays translated from the\r\nFrench, and several letters to Sir Charles Cotterell. This is rather\r\nscanty productivity to serve as a basis for the great vogue Mrs.\r\nPhilips certainly had, nor to the modern reader does the quality of\r\nthe work sufficiently account for the enthusiasm it excited. Yet we\r\nhave abundant testimony that the last ten years of her life were made\r\nbrilliant by praise from the most authoritative sources. Sir Charles\r\nCotterell, her intimate friend and the editor of her _Works_, said\r\nof her: \"We might well have call'd her the English Sappho, she of\r\nall the Poets of former Ages, being for her Verses and her Virtues\r\nboth, the most highly valued; but she has call'd herself ORINDA, a\r\nname that deserves to be added to the Muses, and to live with honour\r\nas long as they. Were our language as generally known to the world,\r\nas the Greek and Latin were anciently, or as the French is now, her\r\nVerses could not be confined within the limits of our Islands, but\r\nwould spread themselves as far as the Continent has Inhabitants, or\r\nas the Seas have any Shore.\" Something must be allowed here for the\r\nenthusiasm of a friend and an editor, but other estimates were almost\r\nas extreme. The Earl of Orrery had thought that the high praise of\r\nher poems at court must be exaggerated, but when he came to know\r\nher and her writings the court eulogies were to him but \"Imperfect\r\nTrophies,\" and he exclaimed, \"If there be Helicon, in Wales it is.\"\r\nHenry Lawes and Dr. Coleman, the best composers of the day, set some\r\nof her poems to music. Cowley in two poems to her praised her for her\r\nspirit \"so rich, so noble, and so high,\" her \"inward Virtue,\" her\r\n\"well-knit Sence,\" and for her poems in which were united all the\r\nexcellences of both sexes. When her translation of _Pompey_ appeared\r\nin the Smock-Alley Theater, Dublin, the Earl of Roscommon wrote the\r\nPrologue and Sir Edward Dering the Epilogue, and the success of the\r\nplay was assured by the enthusiastic support of the aristocracy of\r\nDublin. In 1659 Jeremy Taylor dedicated to her his _Discourse of the\r\nnature, offices and measures of friendship_. Though she does not\r\nexactly fulfill the prophecy of Mr. Thomas Rowe, that \"Orinda should\r\nbe an ever-glorious name to ages yet to come,\" yet her fame was by no\r\nmeans confined to her own brief day. We hear echoes of it far down in\r\nthe eighteenth century. The highest praise that could be given to any\r\nwoman poet was to bracket her with Orinda.\r\n\r\nBy the nineteenth century her vogue was almost extinct, but chance\r\nappreciation came from an unexpected quarter. Keats wrote to Reynolds\r\nin September, 1817:[108]\r\n\r\n  The world, and especially our England, has, within the last\r\n  thirty years, been vexed and teased by a set of Devils, whom\r\n  I Detest so much that I almost hunger after an Acherontic\r\n  promotion to a Torturer, purposely for their accomodation. These\r\n  devils are a set of women, who having taken a snack or Luncheon\r\n  of Literary scraps, set themselves up for towers of Babel in\r\n  languages, Sapphos in Poetry, Euclids in Geometry, and everything\r\n  in nothing. Among such the name of Montague has been preëminent.\r\n  The thing has made a very uncomfortable impression on me. I had\r\n  longed for some real feminine Modesty in these things, and was\r\n  therefore gladdened in the extreme on opening the other day, one\r\n  of Bailey's Books--a book of poetry written by one beautiful Mrs.\r\n  Philips, a friend of Jeremy Taylor's and called \"The Matchless\r\n  Orinda\"--you must have heard of her, and most likely read her\r\n  Poetry--I wish you have not, that I may have the pleasure of\r\n  treating you with a few stanzas.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he quotes the ten stanzas written by Orinda on parting\r\nwith her friend \"Rosania,\" a poem of genuine feeling and quaintly\r\ncharming in expression. \"In other of her poems,\" says Keats, \"there\r\nis a most delicate fancy of the Fletcher kind--which we will con over\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. KATHERINE PHILIPS\r\n\r\n\"From an original Picture in the Collection of her Grace the Dutchess\r\nof Dorset.\" Drawn by J. Thurston. Engraved by W. Finden. From an\r\nengraving in _Effigies Poeticae_. London, 1824]\r\n\r\nThus the magic of Orinda's name reasserts itself, and she is again\r\npraised as a lady of \"delicate fancy,\" \"feminine modesty,\" and\r\nunmatched in friendship. A reintroduction to a general public was\r\ngiven by Mr. Gosse's delightful essay in _Seventeenth Century\r\nStudies_ (1885). And in 1904 a selection from her poems was published\r\nwith an acute \"Appreciation.\"\r\n\r\nIn her own day Orinda was not only prized as a poet, but she was\r\nconsidered the highest example, the prophet and expounder, of true\r\nfriendship. Much of her verse was called forth by her Society of\r\nFriendship. The chief members of this circle were \"Antenor\" (Mr.\r\nPhilips), \"Lucasia\" (Miss Anne Owen), \"Rosania\" (Miss Mary Aubrey),\r\n\"Regina\" (Mrs. John Collier), \"Palæmon\" (Jeremy Taylor), \"Silvander\"\r\n(Sir Edward Dering), \"Policrite\" (Lady Margaret Cavendish),\r\n\"Celimena\" (Miss E. Boyl), \"Cassandra\" (Mrs. C. P., her dear sister),\r\nand \"Critander\" (Mr. J. B.). \"Ardelia,\" \"Phillis,\" and \"Pastora\"\r\nremain unidentified. There were doubtless others in the circle,\r\nbut these we know because they all received poetical tributes from\r\nOrinda. There were over thirty-five private individuals intimately\r\naddressed in her poems.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly the personal character of her poems that secured\r\nher so wide and favorable an audience while her writings were still\r\nin manuscript and known only as they passed from hand to hand. Each\r\nperson addressed was the center of a new circle of readers. But the\r\nintimacy of the poems is one reason for the actual agony Orinda\r\nsuffered when an unauthorized edition of her poems appeared in 1662.\r\n\"Their Names expos'd in this Impression without their leave\" was the\r\nburden of her grief. And she was likewise injured in her modesty. The\r\npublication seemed to put her in the position of a woman bold and\r\nmasculine enough to send her writings into the world. A thousand\r\npounds, she says, would not have bought her consent. To Sir Charles\r\nCotterell she wrote:\r\n\r\n  To me (Sir) who never writ any line in my life with any intention\r\n  to have it printed.... This is a most cruel accident, and hath\r\n  made so proportionate an impression upon me, that really it hath\r\n  cost me a sharp fit of sickness since I heard it.\r\n\r\nIf the garbled version makes a true version a necessary reparation\r\nof the misfortune she will yield, \"but with the same reluctancy as I\r\nwould cut off a Limb to save my Life.\"\r\n\r\n  I am so far from expecting applause for anything I scribble, that\r\n  I can hardly expect pardon; and sometimes I think that employment\r\n  so far above my reach, and unfit for my Sex, that I am going to\r\n  resolve against it for ever; and could I have recovered those\r\n  fugitive Papers that have escaped my hands, I had long since made\r\n  a sacrifice of them all. The truth is, I have an incorrigible\r\n  inclination to that folly of riming, and intending the effects of\r\n  that humour, only for my own amusement in a retir'd life; I did\r\n  not so much resist it as a wiser woman would have done.[109]\r\n\r\nShe had been planning a visit to London, but she wrote in despair to\r\nDorothy Osborne (then Mrs. Temple):\r\n\r\n  I must never show my face there or among any reasonable people\r\n  again, for some dishonest person hath got some collection of my\r\n  Poems as I heare, and hath deliver'd them to a Printer who I\r\n  heare is just upon putting them out and this hath soe extreamly\r\n  disturbed me, both to have my private folly so unhandsomely\r\n  exposed and ye belief that I believe the most part of ye world\r\n  are apt enough to believe yt I connived at this ugly accident\r\n  that I have been on ye rack ever since I heard it, though I have\r\n  written to Col. Jeffries who first sent me word of it to get ye\r\n  Printer punished, the book called in, and me someway publicly\r\n  vindicated yet I shall need all my friends to be my champions\r\n  to ye criticall and mallicious that I am soe innocent of this\r\n  pittiful design of a knave to get a groat that I never was more\r\n  vexed at anything and yt I utterly disclaim whatever he hath so\r\n  unhandsomely expos'd. I know you have goodness and generosity\r\n  enough to doe me right in your company and to give me your\r\n  opinion too how I may best get this impression supressed and\r\n  myself vindicated and therefore I will not beg your pardon for\r\n  troubling you with this impertinent story.[110]\r\n\r\nHer pride of authorship would, however, almost certainly have\r\ntriumphed over her modesty if she could have lived to see the\r\nsumptuous volume with its bravery of eulogistic verse in which Sir\r\nCharles Cotterell enshrined her work. Her letters to him, under the\r\ntitle _Letters from Orinda to Poliarchus_, were published in 1705 and\r\nadd distinctly to her fame.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Orinda becomes a personage to us and an agreeable one.\r\nThere is a note of sincerity through even her most unrestrained\r\npoems; the ardor of her affections is unmistakable; her loyalty to\r\nthe King, to her friends, to her ideas, is genuine. She does not\r\nlabor compliments. Her praise pours forth from the abundance of her\r\nfeeling. Perhaps one reason for her ready popularity was that she\r\naroused no antagonisms. Though a literary woman there was nothing\r\nabout her that was masculine, strident, or assertive. Her outlook on\r\nlife was gracious and tolerant. She loved simplicity and retirement\r\nand was never dazzled by wealth or titles.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there is one interesting and significant fact about her\r\nand that is her success. It was a kind of success new in English\r\nliterary history. A woman without any commanding advantages of birth\r\nor fortune, only moderately good-looking, without any compelling\r\nfascination, unstimulated by parental or tutorial ambitions, with but\r\nthe scantiest schooling, married to an ordinary, rather dull man;\r\na virtuous, sane, orderly, thrifty woman, excellent in business,\r\nhousewifely, with no eccentricities, simply follows her feelings in\r\nfriendship and the bent of her mind towards authorship, and attains\r\nin a few years a position notably high.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mary North (d. 1662)]\r\n\r\nTwo interesting young women who belong chronologically to this group\r\nare not exactly learned ladies, but they had intellectual piquancy\r\nand alertness. One of them, Mary North, was the eldest of the\r\nfourteen children of Dudley, the fourth Lord North. The mother of\r\nthis large family was evidently a remarkable woman. Her son Roger\r\nsays of her: \"The Government of us was In generall severe, but\r\ntender; our mother maintained her authority, and yet condiscended to\r\nEntertain us. She was learned (for a lady) and Eloquent. Had much\r\nKnoledg of History and readyness of witt to express herself, in the\r\npart of Reproof, wherein she was fluent and pungent.... But without\r\noccasion given to the Contrary, she was debonair, familiar, and very\r\nliberall of hir discourse to entertain all.\" This combination of the\r\npungent and the debonair made an effective family discipline, for it\r\nwas said that there was not a son or daughter whose abilities were\r\nnot of a very high order, and that the daughters were hardly less\r\ncultured than their brothers. And of this group Mary was, says Roger,\r\n\"by far the most brilliant--a woman of real genius.\" A charming\r\npicture is given of the ladies of the North family, gathered together\r\naccording to the custom of the time for endless tasks of tapestry\r\nand embroidery, listening entranced to Mary who recited romances for\r\nhours together, giving not only the story, but the conversations,\r\nthe substance of letters, and the general reflections. She had \"a\r\nsuperiour wit, a prodigious memory, and was most agreeable.\" \"She\r\ninstituted a sort of order of the wits of her time and acquaintance,\r\nwhereof the symbol was a sun with a circle touching the rays,\r\nand upon that in blue ground were wrote αὐτάρκης in proper Greek\r\ncharacters, which her father suggested. Divers of these were made in\r\nsilver and enamel, but in embroidery plenty, which were dispersed to\r\nthose wittified ladies who were willing to come into their order;\r\nand for a while they were formally worn, until the foundress fell\r\nunder the government of another, and then it was left off.\"[111] Mary\r\nNorth was married to Sir William Spring of Pakenham and died in 1662\r\nin her twenty-fourth year. Her feminine \"Order of Intellect,\" her\r\nquaint badge, \"the symbol of a community of taste and interest in\r\nliterature, science, and art,\"[112] offer an attractive and hopeful\r\nprospect. It was an inconspicuous little organization, springing up\r\ngayly and spontaneously, and its scope of learning may not have gone\r\nbeyond the French romances the gifted young leader knew by heart, but\r\nit was at any rate an association of young women with some pronounced\r\nliterary aspirations and tastes, and as such it stands out alone, a\r\ncharming picture set in the framework of the anxious years before the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dorothy Osborne, Lady Temple (1627-1694)]\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy Osborne had been Lady Temple some years her husband\r\nwrote from London a \"sweet scrip full of reproaches\" at the\r\nbusinesslike tone and brevity of her letters. She answered with a\r\ntouch of her old sauciness: \"Pray what did you expect I should have\r\nwrit, tell me that I may know how to please you next time. But now I\r\nremember me you would have such letters as I used to write before we\r\nwere marryed, there are a great many such in your cabinet yt I can\r\nsend you if you please, but none in my head I can assure you.\"[113]\r\n\r\nThe love letters thus preserved in Sir William Temple's cabinet\r\nhave had a narrow escape from oblivion. They were found among the\r\nTemple papers when Mr. Courtenay was preparing his elaborate _Life\r\nof Sir William Temple_, and forty-two extracts from the letters were\r\nput by Mr. Courtenay apologetically in an appendix. He could not\r\nbe sure that they would not seem trivial in comparison to matters\r\nof state. This book was published in 1836. Macaulay reviewed it\r\nin the _Edinburgh Review_ for October, 1838, and took occasion to\r\ngive a vivid sketch of Dorothy and her lover. Macaulay's article\r\nled Mr. Edward Abbot Parry to read Courtenay's extracts from the\r\nletters and to weave them together into a kind of story, which was\r\npublished in April, 1886, in _The English Illustrated Magazine_. This\r\nmagazine fell into the hands of Mrs. S. R. Longe who had had access\r\nto the original letters and had copied them with minute accuracy.\r\nThese letters were offered to Mr. Parry for publication and were\r\naccordingly brought out, though with omissions, in 1888.[114] In\r\n1903 the letters were published in full. Thus, after escaping the\r\nvicissitudes of nearly two and a half centuries, these letters became\r\na delight accessible to all.[115]\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy was twenty-one she went with her brother to France. At\r\nthe Isle of Wight they were joined by young Mr. William Temple who\r\npromptly fell in love with Dorothy because of the spirited way she\r\nmet a difficult situation. Her brother had written on the window pane\r\nat the inn some phrases objectionable to the Puritans, and the whole\r\nparty was arrested. Then Dorothy, relying upon the general chivalrous\r\nattitude towards women, took the blame upon herself, and they were\r\nset free. The courtship thus begun was destined to last seven years.\r\nThere were few meetings and the correspondence was carried on with\r\nall possible secrecy, for both the Osbornes and the Temples had\r\nother plans for the young people. It was a difficult seven years for\r\nDorothy. The Osbornes lived at Chicksands Priory in Bedfordshire,\r\na lonely and not very interesting region. Dorothy's mother died\r\nin 1650. After a long illness, during which she was his constant\r\nattendant, her father died in 1654. During these years her brother\r\nwas the only one of the family with her in the strange old house. And\r\nfrom him came her chief trial, for it was the effort of his life to\r\nsee her well married. Young men, middle-aged men, old men, aspired\r\nto be Mistress Dorothy's \"servants.\" The ancient Priory saw a train\r\nof lovers sent away unsatisfied. Dorothy gave all sorts of reasons\r\nfor her fastidious and critical attitude towards her suitors--all\r\nreasons but the real one. Mr. Temple had no assured income, Dorothy\r\nbut a small dowry, and no families in their rank of life could be\r\nexpected to sanction so imprudent a choice. In the meantime silence\r\nand faithfulness was the only resource of the impecunious lovers. It\r\nwas a hard fate, but not without compensations for later generations,\r\nfor if they had married happily on coming out of France there would\r\nhave been no bundle of letters in the old cabinet at Sheen.\r\n\r\nThere are various indications that Dorothy had numerous\r\ncorrespondents. That they did not save her letters is our great\r\nloss, for we can imagine few more delightful ways of being inducted\r\ninto the life of the times than through the letters of Mistress\r\nDorothy. The \"Matchless Orinda\" was one of her correspondents, but\r\nonly one letter arising out of this friendship has been preserved.\r\nIt may justly be quoted entire because it serves to unite the two\r\nmost interesting women of the time, and because it shows how Mrs.\r\nPhilips, in the plentitude of her fame, with Dublin dramatic triumphs\r\nfresh upon her, with the aristocracy of London adding leaves to her\r\nlaurel crown, courted the quiet Mrs. Temple living the most retired\r\nand domestic of lives at Sheen. This letter has the further pathetic\r\ninterest of being one of the last Orinda wrote, for when she reached\r\nLondon on this visit she had so longed for she fell a victim to that\r\nmost dreaded scourge, the small-pox:\r\n\r\n  _Deare Madam_,--You treat me in your letters so much to my\r\n  advantage and above my merit that I am almost affray'd to tell\r\n  you how exceedingly I am pleased with them lesst you should\r\n  attribute yt contentment to ye delight I take in being praised\r\n  whereas I am extreamely deceived if that be ye ground of it,\r\n  though I confess it is not free from vanity. I can not choose\r\n  but be proud of being owned by soe valuable a person as you are,\r\n  and one whom all my inclinations carry me to honour and love at\r\n  a very great rate, and you will find by the trouble I last gave\r\n  you of this kind how impossible it will be for you to be rid of\r\n  an importunity which you have much encourag'd and how much your\r\n  late silence alarm'd one yt is soe much concern'd for ye honour\r\n  you doe her in allowing her to hope you will frequently let her\r\n  know she hath some room in ye particular favour, I hope you\r\n  have pardon'd me that complaint and allow'd a little jealousy\r\n  to that great passion I have for you and that I shall with some\r\n  more assurance come to thank you for this last favour of 12th\r\n  instant, and must beg you to believe that if my convent were in\r\n  Cataya and I a recluse by vow to it, yet I should never attain\r\n  mortification enough to be able willingly to deny myself the\r\n  great entertainment of your correspondance, which seems to remove\r\n  me out of a solitary religious house on ye mountains and place\r\n  me in the most advantageous prospect upon both court and town\r\n  and give me right to a better place than of either, and that\r\n  madam is your friendship, which is so great a present, that there\r\n  is but one way to make it more valuable and yt is by making it\r\n  less ceremonious and by using me with a freedom that may give me\r\n  more access into your heart and this beg from you with a great\r\n  earnestness, and will promise you that whatsoever liberties\r\n  of that kind you allow me, yt I will never so much abase that\r\n  goodness as to press mine own advantages further than you shall\r\n  permit or lessen any of the respect I ow you, by the less formal\r\n  approaches I desire to make to you who though I esteem above most\r\n  of the world yet I love yet more.[116]\r\n\r\nOrinda was a letter-writer of no mean ability herself, but she wrote\r\nwith something of a professional tone, and possibly with an eye to\r\nnumerous readers. It was only Dorothy that could make town and court\r\nlive again. Macaulay's philippics against \"the dignity of history\"\r\nand his eulogy of the social value of such letters as Dorothy's must\r\nfind approval from every one who tries to revivify a forgotten era.\r\nDorothy was an acute observer. If the novel of domestic life had\r\nbeen in existence in her day she would have found the natural place\r\nfor her clever and slightly caustic pen. The successive suitors and\r\nvarious dull visitors at Chicksands could have had little suspicion\r\nof the merry and facile wit that was serving up their oddities for\r\nthe amusement of her lover. Furthermore, Dorothy was an inveterate\r\nreader, and a reader with mental reactions, an independent judgment,\r\nand a skill in witty comment. The general tone of the letters is a\r\ndelightful mixture of humor, tenderness, and coquetry. No writing\r\nof the time was more unaffectedly human. And there were counsels of\r\nprudence and of good sense, bits of worldly wisdom and penetrating\r\nknowledge of human foibles. And with it all was the charm of style.\r\nWhen Mr. Temple wishes to know how she spends her day she outlines\r\nthe slow-moving hours and closes with this delicate picture of\r\nevening:\r\n\r\n  The heat of the day is spent in reading or working, and about six\r\n  or seven o'clock I walk out into a common that lies hard by the\r\n  house, where a great many young wenches keep sheep and cows, and\r\n  sit in the shade singing of ballads. I go to them and compare\r\n  their voices and beauties to some ancient shepherdesses that I\r\n  have read of, and find a vast difference there: but, trust me,\r\n  I think these are as innocent as those could be. I talk to them\r\n  and find they want nothing to make them the happiest people in\r\n  the world but the knowledge that they are so. Most commonly when\r\n  we are in the midst of our discourse, one looks about her, and\r\n  spies her cows going into the corn, and then away they all run as\r\n  if they had wings to their heels. I, that am not so nimble, stay\r\n  behind; and when I see them driving home their cattle, I think\r\n  't is time for me to return too. When I have supped, I go into\r\n  the garden, and so to the side of a small river that runs by it,\r\n  when I sit down and wish you were with me (you had best say this\r\n  is not kind neither). In earnest, 't is a pleasant place, and\r\n  would be much more so to me if I had your company. I sit there\r\n  sometimes till I am lost with thinking; and were it not for some\r\n  cruel thoughts of the crossness of our fortunes that will not let\r\n  me sleep there, I should forget that there were such a thing to\r\n  be done as going to bed.[117]\r\n\r\nDorothy's easy, natural tone was quite in accord with her theory of\r\nletter-writing. She writes to Mr. Temple:\r\n\r\n  All letters, methinks, should be free and easy as one's\r\n  discourse, not studied like an oration, nor made up of hard words\r\n  like a charm. 'T is an admirable thing to see how some people\r\n  will labour to find terms that will obscure a plain sense, like\r\n  a gentleman I knew who would never say \"the weather grew cold,\"\r\n  but that \"winter begins to salute us.\" I have no patience for\r\n  such coxcombs, and cannot blame an old uncle of mine who threw\r\n  the standish at his man's head because he writ a letter for him,\r\n  where instead of saying (as his master bid him) that \"he had the\r\n  gout in his hand\" he said \"that the gout would not permit him to\r\n  put pen to paper.\" The fellow thought he had mended it mightily,\r\n  and that putting pen to paper was much better than plain writing!\r\n\r\nHow in 1652-54 did Dorothy escape the grand style? She was steeped in\r\nromances and she read Jeremy Taylor with delight. But there are no\r\npreciosities, no attempted elaborateness or ornamentation or splendor\r\nin her style. She might have written after the moderns had won their\r\nvictory so direct and straightforward is her speech. But the infinite\r\ncharm of her letters belongs to no age. It is the expression of a\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nWe cannot leave Dorothy Osborne's letters without feeling defrauded\r\nthat there are so few of them. After their marriage in 1655 the\r\nTemples lived five years in Ireland. Sir William's importance in\r\nstate affairs led to a later residence in Brussels and at The Hague.\r\nAfter 1681 they lived in retirement at Moor Park and Swift and Stella\r\nwere of their household. What opportunities for letters if Dorothy\r\nhad only been as indefatigable as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu! But\r\nexcept for a few personal notes from Sheen in 1665-67, Dorothy fades\r\nfrom our sight. Did accumulated sorrows sap her energy and dim her\r\njoyous courage? She had nine children. Seven of them died in infancy.\r\nHer daughter died of small-pox. Her son committed suicide because of\r\nfancied inability to perform a diplomatic mission. It is said that\r\nat some time during the years 1689-94 Queen Mary and Dorothy kept up\r\na continuous correspondence. If such letters were written there is\r\nnow no trace of them. The latest published letter from Dorothy is in\r\n1689 in response to some expression of condolence for the death of\r\nher son. It is difficult to recognize in this subdued and dignified,\r\nalmost cold and stately lady, the sparkling and mischievous Dorothy\r\nof the earlier letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lady Pakington (d. 1679)]\r\n\r\nJust about contemporary with Mrs. Philips and the Duchess of\r\nNewcastle was a remarkable woman of quite another type. This was\r\nLady Pakington, the daughter of Lord Coventry. If, as was long\r\nsupposed, she wrote the series of books of which _The Whole Duty of\r\nMan_ was one, that fact would place her very high in the ranks of\r\nseventeenth-century authors. With the consensus of expert opinion\r\nnow against the ascription of these books to her, she yet holds an\r\nimportant place among learned women.[118] Dr. George Hickes, whose\r\ndeanery was near Westwood, the home of Sir John Pakington, and who\r\nwas intimate with the family, in the Preface to his _Thesaurus_ which\r\nwas inscribed to Sir John, gives a \"character\" of Lady Pakington\r\nin which he says she was trained in her youth by \"the excellently\r\nlearned Sir Norton Knatchbull,\" and that later in life she was\r\nmistress of all the learning, good judgment, sound thinking, and\r\npiety necessary to have been the author of the famous _Whole Duty\r\nof Man_. He says that noted divines declared her as learned in the\r\nhistory of pagan and Christian systems of thought as were they\r\nthemselves; and that she knew concerning the antiquities of her own\r\ncounty \"almost as much as the greatest proficients in that kind of\r\nknowledge.\" Especially did Dr. Hickes comment on her \"talent for\r\nspeaking correctly, pertinently, clearly, and gracefully,\" and on\r\n\"her evenness of style and consistent manner of writing.\" No woman\r\nof the period came nearer being the tutelary deity of a coterie\r\nthan did Lady Pakington. Her loyalty to the Church of England and\r\nto the Stuart cause made of her beautiful home at Westwood during\r\nthe Protectorate a natural resort for royalist divines. Dr. Hammond,\r\nBishop Fell, Bishop Morley, Bishop Pearson, Bishop Henchman, Bishop\r\nGunning, were among those whose friendship and esteem she had\r\nacquired by her \"great virtues and eminent attainments in knowledge.\"\r\nBefore the Restoration she held a kind of Church of England salon,\r\nand though most of the men who frequented it were given benefices\r\nby Charles II and so scattered through England, Lady Pakington, by\r\nletter and occasional personal intercourse, kept up the friendships\r\nof the earlier days, through the nineteen years that she lived after\r\nthe Restoration. And even if she did not write _The Whole Duty of\r\nMan_ (1657) and the series that followed it, these books arose from\r\nthe discussions held at Westwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mary Boyle, the Countess of Warwick (1624-1678)]\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Warwick is best known from her _Diary_, her\r\n_Autobiography_, and the sermon preached at her funeral by Dr.\r\nAnthony Walker, rector of Fyfield in Essex. The _Diary_ was\r\nkept from July, 1666, till 1678. The part from 1666 to 1672 was\r\npublished in 1847 by the Religious Tract Society with a memoir. The\r\nremainder is among the manuscripts in the British Museum.[119] Her\r\n_Autobiography_, under the title, _Some Specialties in the Life\r\nof M. Warwicke_, was published by the Percy Society in 1848.[120]\r\nDr. Walker's sermon, entitled _The Virtuous Woman found, her loss\r\nbewailed, and character exemplified_, etc., was published in 1678 and\r\n1687.[121]\r\n\r\nMary Boyle was married to Mr. Rich, afterwards Earl of Warwick, when\r\nshe was but fifteen. Her life before that time she thus describes:\r\n\"I was married into my husband's family, as vain, as idle, and as\r\ninconsiderate a person as possible, minding nothing but curious\r\ndressing and fond and rich clothes, and spending my precious time\r\nin nothing else but reading romances, and in reading and seeing\r\nplays, and in going to court, and Hide Park and Spring Garden; and\r\nI was so fond of the court, that I had taken a secret resolution\r\nthat if my father died, and I was mistress of myself, I would become\r\na courtier.\"[122] But by the time she was twenty-one a complete\r\nchange was manifest. She became exceedingly devout. There is no more\r\nromance reading. The books on her chosen list are \"St. Bernard,\r\nGeorge Herbert, Jeremy Taylor, Baxter, Samuel Rutherford Clarke, the\r\n_Confessions_ of St. Augustine, John Janeway's _Dying_, Foxe's _Book\r\nof Martyrs_, Cayley's _Glimpses of Eternity_.\"[123] Her writing was\r\nall religious in tone. Rules for a Holy Life, Occasional Meditations,\r\nand Pious Reflections were among the topics she found most congenial.\r\nThe _Specialties in the Life of M. Warwicke_ shows the intensity of\r\nher struggle after spiritual perfection and her genuine aloofness\r\nfrom the gay and splendid scenes in which her rank compelled her\r\nto bear a part. The most ordinary occurrences, such as \"lighting\r\nmany candles at once,\" or \"drawing the window-curtains to prevent\r\nthe sun's putting out the fire,\" suggested pious reflections. At a\r\nglorious banquet at Whitehall \"the trumpets sounding in the midst\r\nof all that great show\" put mortifying thoughts into her mind and\r\nmade her consider \"what if the trump of God should now sound?\" In\r\na meditation entitled \"Upon looking out of my window at Chelsea,\r\nupon the Thames,\" her delight in the sweet river when it is calm and\r\nserene, and her dislike of it--so that she shut her window and ceased\r\nto look--when it was rough, is moralized into the charm of calm and\r\npatient people as against those of turbulent passions.[124]\r\n\r\nLady Warwick's writings exhibit none of the joyous or fervent aspects\r\nof religion. In the midst of domestic trials, surrounded by an alien\r\nlife, she was steadily tutoring her own heart, subduing her sins,\r\nfollowing a high ideal. Dr. Walker in his sermon gives an example\r\nof seventeenth-century pulpit oratory in his effort adequately to\r\npraise this great lady, as conspicuous for goodness as for her rank\r\nand wealth: \"An hundred mouths, and a thousand tongues though they\r\nall flowed with nectar, would be too few to praise her.\" \"Oh,\" he\r\nexclaims, \"for a Chrysostom's mouth, for an angel's tongue, to\r\ndescribe this terrestrial seraphine; or a ray of light condensed into\r\na pencil, and made tactile, to give you this glorious child of light\r\nin _viva effigie_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lucy Apsley, Mrs. Hutchinson (1620-?)]\r\n\r\nThat Lucy Hutchinson had written a life of her husband was known\r\nby many people and there were frequent requests in the eighteenth\r\ncentury that so valuable a historical document should be made\r\naccessible to the public. Mrs. Catherine Macaulay was one of those\r\nurgent in this matter, but without avail.[125] It was not till the\r\nmanuscript came into the possession of the Reverend Julius Hutchinson\r\nthat it was published. After the first edition in 1806 three editions\r\nappeared in four years. Some other writings besides the _Memoirs_\r\nwere found among the papers of Mrs. Hutchinson. Of these the precious\r\n_Autobiography_ was but a fragment. It not only closed abruptly, but\r\nleaves had been torn out. But from what remains we get one of the\r\nfew accounts of the home education of girls in the first half of the\r\nseventeenth century. Her father and mother, extremely glad to welcome\r\na girl after three sons, \"applied all their cares and spared no cost\"\r\nin her education. She describes this education as follows:\r\n\r\n  By the time I was four years old I read English perfectly, and\r\n  having a great memory, I was carried to sermons; and while I was\r\n  very young could remember and repeat them exactly, and being\r\n  caressed, the love of praise tickled me, and made me attend more\r\n  heedfully. When I was about seven years of age, I remember I\r\n  had at one time eight tutors in several qualities, languages,\r\n  music, dancing, writing and needle-work; but my genius was quite\r\n  averse from all but my book, and that I was so eager of, that\r\n  my mother, thinking it prejudiced my health, would moderate me\r\n  in it; yet this rather animated me than kept me back, and every\r\n  moment I could steal from my play I would employ in any book I\r\n  could find, when my own were locked up from me. After dinner and\r\n  supper I still had an hour allowed me to play, and then I would\r\n  steal into some hole or other to read. My father would have me\r\n  learn Latin, and I was so apt that I outstripped my brothers who\r\n  were at school, although my father's chaplain, that was my tutor\r\n  was a pitiful dull fellow. My brothers, who had a great deal of\r\n  wit, had some emulation at the progress I made in my learning,\r\n  which very well pleased my father; though my mother would have\r\n  been contented if I had not so wholly addicted myself to that\r\n  as to neglect my other qualities. As for music and dancing, I\r\n  profited very little in them, and would never practise my lute or\r\n  harpsichords but when my masters were with me; and for my needle\r\n  I absolutely hated it. Play among other children I despised, and\r\n  when I was forced to entertain such as came to visit me, I tired\r\n  them with more grave instructions than their mothers, and plucked\r\n  all their babies to pieces, and kept the children in such awe,\r\n  that they were glad when I entertained myself with elder company;\r\n  to whom I was very acceptable, and living in the house with many\r\n  persons that had a great deal of wit, and very profitable\r\n  serious discourses being frequent at my father's table and in my\r\n  mother's drawing-room, I was very attentive to all, and gathered\r\n  up things that I would utter again, to great admiration of many\r\n  that took my memory and imitation for wit. It pleased God that,\r\n  through the good instructions of my mother, and the sermons she\r\n  carried me to, I was convinced that the knowledge of God was the\r\n  most excellent study, and accordingly applied myself to it, and\r\n  to practise as I was taught. I used to exhort my mother's maids\r\n  much, and to turn their idle discourses to good subjects: but I\r\n  thought, when I had done this on the Lord's day, and every day\r\n  performed my due tasks of reading and praying, that then I was\r\n  free to anything that was not sin.[126]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. LUCY HUTCHINSON AND HER SON\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in _Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson_,\r\n1808]\r\n\r\nElsewhere she notes other elements of her education. She says that as\r\nsoon as she was weaned, a Frenchwoman was taken to be her dry-nurse\r\nand she was taught to speak French and English together. At the\r\nsiege of Nottingham Castle Mrs. Hutchinson is represented as acting\r\nthe part of a surgeon. This knowledge may doubtless be referred to\r\ninstructions by her mother. Sir Allen Apsley, Lucy's father, was\r\nlieutenant of the Tower of London during her youth, and Mrs. Apsley\r\nwas very generous and humane to the prisoners. Her daughter says of\r\nher:\r\n\r\n  What my father allowed her she spent not in vanities, although\r\n  she had what was rich and requisite upon occasions, but she\r\n  laid most of it out in pious and charitable uses. Sir Walter\r\n  Raleigh and Mr. Ruthin being prisoners in the Tower, and\r\n  addicting themselves to chemistry, she suffered them to make rare\r\n  experiments at her cost, partly to comfort and divert the poor\r\n  prisoners, and partly to gain the knowledge of their experiments,\r\n  and the medicines to help such poor people as were not able to\r\n  seek physicians. By these means she acquired a great deal of\r\n  skill, which was very profitable to many all her life.[127]\r\n\r\nThe love story of Lucy Apsley and Colonel Hutchinson is curiously\r\ninterwoven with her learning. When Lucy was sixteen her mother took\r\nher into Wiltshire in pursuance of a contemplated marriage contract\r\nand left a younger sister at a house where she was \"tabled for the\r\npractice of her lute.\" Mr. Hutchinson, \"tabled\" at the same house,\r\nwas attracted by the vivacious child, and frequently accompanied her\r\nwhen she went over to her mother's house. On one of these occasions\r\nhe saw some Latin books and was much interested to find that they\r\nbelonged to Lucy. Then he heard that this Lucy was \"reserved and\r\nstudious,\" then that she composed songs above \"the ordinary reach\r\nof a she-wit,\" then that she had \"sense above the rest,\" but that\r\nshe \"shunned the converse of men as a plague.\" Strangely enough,\r\nthese accounts, or some magic, or the hand of Providence, plunged\r\nMr. Hutchinson into the despairs and ardors of love even before he\r\nhad seen the lady. On her return, the proposed marriage contract\r\nnot having been completed, he daily frequented her mother's house,\r\nand for six weeks \"in the sweet season of the spring\" they had\r\nopportunity for converse with each other. During this period some\r\nenvious ladies endeavored to break the friendship by telling him that\r\nLucy neglected her dress and all womanish ornaments, giving herself\r\nup wholly to study and writing. But since his love had owed its\r\ninception to a sight of her Latin books, and had been stimulated by\r\nhearing her poetry, these insinuations did not interfere with what\r\nhis wife calls \"a more handsome management of love than the best\r\nromances describe.\"[128]\r\n\r\nSomewhat later Lucy Hutchinson's love of learning led her to at least\r\na slight knowledge of Greek and Hebrew. That she kept up her Latin\r\nis shown by the fact that she translated part of the _Æneid_. In\r\nher early married life she found scholastic means to mitigate the\r\nmonotony of the needlework she loathed. Out of a \"youthful curiosity\r\nto understand things she had heard so much of at second-hand\" she\r\ntranslated six books of _Lucretius_ into verse, accomplishing this\r\ntask, she says, \"in a room where my children practised the several\r\nqualities they were taught with their tutors, and I numbered the\r\nsyllables of my translation by the threads of the canvas I wrought\r\nin, and set them down with a pen and ink that stood by me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not, however, in Mrs. Hutchinson's life much opportunity\r\nfor scenes so domestic as this. She was married to Mr. Hutchinson\r\nin 1638. By 1642 her husband was definitely committed to the side\r\nof the Puritans, and the rest of their life till his death in 1664\r\nwas one of anxiety, conflict, and baffled high endeavor. But it was\r\nalso a life of achievement and excitement, and constantly sweetened\r\nand stimulated by extraordinary affection between husband and wife.\r\nWhen at his death she retired to the family home at Owthorpe the days\r\nmust have looked very blank and empty to the heroine of Nottingham\r\nCastle. Not even the care of her eight children could keep her mind\r\nfrom dwelling on the past. The message her husband sent her from\r\nhis death-bed in the prison, \"Let her, as she is above other women,\r\nshow herself, on this occasion, a good Christian, and above other\r\nwomen,\"[129] helped her to restrain extreme signs of grief, but her\r\nheart and mind were with him. And the mechanic exercise that dulled\r\nher grief was the writing of his _Life_. She had kept a rough sort\r\nof diary and this was the basis for the longer work. The writing\r\nwas done between 1664 and 1671 when Mrs. Hutchinson herself died.\r\nThe work was addressed \"To my Children\" and its purpose was to make\r\nthem know the character and deeds of their father. But the narrative\r\ngoes much farther than that. It is a minute account of the persons\r\nand events of that portion of the Civil War especially connected\r\nwith Nottingham. She writes as an eye-witness and a participant.\r\nShe wields a pen vigorous, racy, and unafraid. She had a genius\r\nfor picturesque characterization, and her scornful descriptions of\r\ncowards and traitors are veiled by no feminine softness of phrase.\r\nWhen describing such treacherous members of the Parliament Party as\r\nCharles White and Chadwick and his wife her vocabulary of abuse is\r\nunstinted. But she is equally fluent in her account of heroes such as\r\nColonel Thornhagh. The intrigues, the factions, the cross-currents,\r\nwithin the Puritan Party are as minutely analyzed and laid open as\r\nis the general contest between King and Parliament. Furthermore, the\r\nbook is readable from beginning to end. It moves with the rapidity\r\nof a novel of adventure. Mr. A. H. Upham[130] has analyzed Mrs.\r\nHutchinson's work to show that it was probably suggested by the\r\nDuchess of Newcastle's _Life_ of her husband, and that, further,\r\nthe general plan and even the choice of detail were guided by the\r\nDuchess's _Memoir_. The _Life_ of the Duke of Newcastle, though\r\nnot published till 1667, was written in 1665, and since the two\r\nfamilies were neighbors, and knew each other well, it might easily\r\nbe that Mrs. Hutchinson was acquainted with the work of the Duchess\r\nin manuscript. This ingenious theory is maintained by citations of\r\npassages showing numerous similarities. But the fact remains that\r\nMrs. Hutchinson's _Memoir_ moves forward as from the force of an\r\noriginal impulse, nobly religious, shrewd, caustic, affectionate, and\r\nnaïve. It was, in subject-matter and style, a notable achievement,\r\nand while succeeding in the amplest measure in its purpose of\r\nexalting Colonel Hutchinson's memory, quite as deservedly gives to\r\nMrs. Hutchinson her own unsought and higher pinnacle of fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ann Harrison, Lady Fanshawe (1625-1680)]\r\n\r\nA few years before her death Lady Fanshawe wrote for her son a\r\nnarrative of her life. Of her own education she says: \"Now it is\r\nnecessary to say something of my mother's education of me, which was\r\nwith all the advantages that time afforded, both for working all\r\nsorts of fine works with my needle, and learning French, singing,\r\n(the) lute, the virginals, and dancing; and, notwithstanding I\r\nlearned as well as most did, yet I was wild to that degree that\r\nthe hours of my beloved recreation took up too much of my time;\r\nfor I loved riding in the first place, and running, and all active\r\npastimes; and in fine I was what we graver people call a hoyting\r\ngirl. But to be just to myself I never did mischief to myself or\r\nother people, nor one immodest action or word in my life; but\r\nskipping and activity was my delight. But upon my mother's death\r\nand as an offering to her memory I flung away those little\r\nchildishnesses that formerly possessed me and by my father's\r\ncommand took upon me the charge of his house and family, which I\r\nso ordered by my excellent mother's example as found acceptance in\r\nhis sight.\"[131] At her mother's death Ann was \"fifteen years and\r\nthree months\" old, and the household she took charge of was one \"of\r\nplenty and hospitality,\" her father having a very great estate. In\r\n1644 she married Sir Richard Fanshawe to whom she was passionately\r\ndevoted during the twenty-six troubled years of their life together.\r\nShe says: \"Glory be to God, we never had but one mind throughout our\r\nlives, our souls were wrapped up in each other, our aims and designs\r\none, and our resentments one. We so studied one the other that we\r\nknew each other's mind by our looks; whatever was real happiness God\r\ngave it me in him.\"[132]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY FANSHAWE\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in _Memoirs of Lady Fanshawe_, London, 1830]\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Fanshawe wrote her _Memoirs_, her son Richard, her youngest\r\nchild, was about ten or twelve years old. Her purpose apparently\r\nwas to recount all the facts of the eventful family career. The\r\nnarrative, except for an occasional outburst, was uncolored by\r\nemotion. One series of events recorded is the births and deaths of\r\nchildren. In a period of twenty years Lady Fanshawe had fourteen\r\nchildren and she records the deaths of nine of them. This would seem\r\nto be suffering and sorrow enough for one life. But we get an added\r\nconception of the family vicissitudes when we discover that no two\r\nof the fourteen children were born in the same house, and no two\r\nof the nine who died were buried in the same churchyard. Madrid,\r\nLisbon, Paris, Yorkshire, Kent, Hertfordshire, Oxford, were places\r\nof sad memory to the bereaved mother. Yet, except in the cases of\r\n\"little Nan\" and the first Richard, there is simply a recital of\r\nfacts and dates. Lady Fanshawe was but fifty-five when she died,\r\nbut she had gone through so much that a re-living of past emotions\r\nas well as a recalling of facts would have made the writing of the\r\n_Memoirs_ an impossibility. As a narrative of the externals of life\r\nthe story has singular interest. It abounds in striking contrasts.\r\nMoney stringency, mishaps by land and sea, sicknesses, imprisonments,\r\ndeaths, mingle strangely with official splendors, royal gifts, rich\r\nfurnishings, gorgeous apparel. It is personal in tone, with as little\r\nhistorical detail as was consistent with carrying the narrative\r\nforward. And for that reason it is of importance to-day as a closer\r\nrecord of life than historians of the Civil War or of the reign of\r\nCharles II are likely to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margaret Blagge, Mrs. Godolphin (1652-1678)]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting personality in this early group is the beautiful\r\nMrs.[133] Margaret Blagge. She is the supreme example of a developed\r\nreligious sense in the court of Charles II. She was not driven\r\nto a life of devotion through a grief-enshrouded heart. Religion\r\nwas to her joy and ecstasy. John Evelyn recorded in his Diary a\r\ndetermination to consecrate the worthy life of Margaret Blagge to\r\nposterity, and when he died in 1706 he left a list of \"things I\r\nwould write out fair and reform if I had leisure,\" among them being\r\nthe _Life of Mrs. Godolphin_. This manuscript was first published\r\nin 1847. It records a life of singular charm and interest. Yet the\r\nfacts of Margaret Blagge's life are meager enough. She was born\r\nin 1652; was early in France with the Countess of Guildford; when\r\nscarcely twelve became maid of honor to the Duchess of York; and then\r\non the death of the Duchess in 1671 entered into the same service\r\nwith Queen Catherine; in 1674, after a nine-year courtship, married\r\nSidney Godolphin; and in 1678 died in child-birth. It is her inner\r\nlife that counts, and that life would have left small record had not\r\nthe beautiful young maid of honor chosen the wise and religious John\r\nEvelyn as her friendly counselor in her difficult attempt to maintain\r\na life of purity and piety in the most dissolute court of Europe.\r\nEvelyn recounts the success of her devout life in these words:\r\n\"Arethusa pass'd through all those turbulent waters without soe much\r\nas the least staine or tincture in her Chrystall; with her Piety grew\r\nup her Witt, which was soe sparkling, accompanyed with a Judgment\r\nand Eloquence so exterordinary, a Beauty and Ayre soe charmeing and\r\nlovely, in a word, an Address soe universally takeing, that, after\r\na few years, the Court never saw or had seen such a Constellation\r\nof perfections amongst all their splendid Circles.\"[134] But though\r\nshe was regarded as \"a little miracle\" at court, her heart was never\r\nthere. To no young woman of the time were the pomp and glory of the\r\nworld more alluringly open, but she turned instinctively from all\r\nsuch joys. She counted her beauty a snare and would never \"trick and\r\ndress herself vpp ... to be fine and ador'd.\" Lovers crowded about\r\nher, but she avoided the vain converse of gallants. Evelyn records\r\nher particular gift for mimicry, recitation, acting, but such talents\r\nshe held in abeyance. At sixteen she acted in a court play, probably\r\nDryden's _Indian Emperor_, with great success, but her growingly\r\ndevout spirit came to abhor such recreations, so that when she was\r\nsummoned by royal request to act in Crowne's _Calisto_, in 1674, even\r\nthough the play was to be given all by ladies, and those the most\r\nillustrious in the land, it was a matter of almost tragic grief to\r\nher that her duty forbade a refusal. \"To be herselfe an Actoresse ...\r\ncost her not only great reluctancy but many teares.\"[135] Though she\r\nwas decked with jewels worth £20,000, though she \"trode the Stage\r\nwith a surprizeing and admirable Aire,\" and though the whole theater\r\nwas extolling her, she felt no transport, but, when an interval came,\r\n\"retired into a Corner, reading a book of devotion.\" Not even the\r\nfact that she played the part of \"Diana, the Goddess of Chastity,\"\r\nconsoled her.\r\n\r\nShe had one real calling and that was to a religious life. As a\r\nchild of seven, in France with the Countess of Guildford, though\r\noften \"tempted by that By-Gott proselitesse to goe to Masse and be a\r\npapist,\"[136] she yet could maintain her own faith. Because of her\r\nspiritual precocity she was \"admitted to the holy Sacrament when she\r\nwas hardly Eleaven years of age.\" Though she disliked Catholicism,\r\nshe praised nunneries, and would have chosen a retired life of\r\ndevotion and good works, had not her love for Mr. Godolphin and the\r\nurgent advice of Mr. Evelyn restrained her. Nearly all her writing\r\nand reading were along religious lines. Mr. Evelyn says on this point:\r\n\r\n  She has houres alsoe for reading historye and diversions of\r\n  that nature; butt allwayes such as were choice, profitable and\r\n  instructive, and she had devoured an incredible deale of that\r\n  solid knowledge, and could accompt of it to admiration; soe as\r\n  I have even beene astonished to find such an heape of excellent\r\n  things and material observations collected and written with her\r\n  owne hand, many of which (since her being with God) came to myne;\r\n  for, besides a world of admirable prayers and pieces of flagrant\r\n  devotion, meditations, and discourses on various subjects (which\r\n  she compos'd), there was hardly a booke she read that she had not\r\n  common placed, as it were, or taken some remarkable note of; add\r\n  this to the Diary of her owne life, actions, resolutions, and\r\n  other circumstances, of which I shall give some specimen. She had\r\n  contracted the intire historye of the Scriptures, and the most\r\n  illustrious examples, sentences, and precepts, digested under\r\n  opposite and proper heads; and collected togeather the result of\r\n  every Article of the Apostles' Creed, out of Bishop Pearson's\r\n  excellent Treatise. I have allready spoken of her Sermon Notes:\r\n  butt to give a just Account of her Letters, they are so many and\r\n  in so excellent naturall and easy a style, that, as for their\r\n  number, one would believe she did nothing else butt write, soe,\r\n  for their weight and ingenuity, that she ought to doe nothing\r\n  else; and soe easyly did her Invention flow, that I have seen her\r\n  write a very long letter without once takeing off her pen (butt\r\n  to dip it), and that with exterordinary Judgment.[137]\r\n\r\nHer _Diary_ is a delightfully spontaneous document. Here is one\r\nResolution:\r\n\r\n  June the 2d.\r\n\r\n  I will nere play this halfe year butt att 3 penny omber, and then\r\n  with one att halves. I will not I doe not vow, but I will not doe\r\n  it;--what, loose mony att Cards, yet not give (to) the poore! 'T\r\n  is robbing God, misspending tyme, and missimploying my Talent:\r\n  three great Sinns. Three pounds would have kept three people from\r\n  starveing a month: well, I will not play.[138]\r\n\r\nEqually genuine and charming, but in more decorous and solemn\r\nfashion, is the letter in which she consecrated John Evelyn\r\nher friend. Indeed, the whole quaint and formal episode of the\r\nestablishment of this remarkable friendship, seems incredibly pure\r\nand lovely when thought of as occurring in the court of which\r\nGrammont's _Memoirs_ is a fair record. Evelyn wrote \"a little\r\nmaster-piece of biography,\" partly because of his intimate knowledge\r\nof Mrs. Godolphin's spiritual experience and his personal affection\r\nfor her, but also, in part, because his imagination was inevitably\r\nstimulated by the vision of a life so crystal clear in an environment\r\nso murky.\r\n\r\nThe versatility and intellectual energy of the Duchess of Newcastle,\r\nthe quick wit and instinct for style in Dorothy Osborne's letters,\r\nthe grave and sincere religious feeling coupled with considerable\r\ntheological learning on the part of women in influential positions\r\nlike Margaret Blagge, Lady Pakington, and Lady Warwick, the vivid\r\nsocial and political pictures in the biographies by Mrs. Hutchinson\r\nand Lady Fanshawe, the gay playing with _belles lettres_ in Mary\r\nNorth's little society, and especially the extraordinary vogue of\r\nMrs. Philips, are sufficient indications, as we look back over the\r\nperiod, that a new spirit was awake. It reads now almost as if there\r\nwere a general and brilliant opening of literary pursuits to women.\r\nBut it is also significant to recall that Mrs. Philips and the\r\nDuchess of Newcastle were the only two women whose ability or learned\r\ntastes were known at the time beyond their own small private circle.\r\nIn reality the work was sporadic, secluded, uninfluential. And the\r\nfame even of the Duchess of Newcastle and Mrs. Philips is hardly\r\nestablished before 1660. It is with the Restoration that the more\r\nvaried and public activities begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE CENTURY FOLLOWING THE RESTORATION\r\n\r\nThe period to be here presented in detail is the century following\r\nthe Restoration. During this period the work of women spreads out\r\nin new directions. Not only is there a greater variety in the kinds\r\nof writing, but other forms of self-expression are entered upon.\r\nIn this more complicated era the strictly chronological method\r\nbecomes confusing. It seems more desirable to take up the work under\r\ndifferent species, keeping to chronological development within each\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of new work by women, acting and painting, demand brief\r\npreliminary notice. Though possibly not within the category of\r\nlearned occupations they must yet be recognized as of great\r\nimportance in the new life opening before women.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTRESSES\r\n\r\nCharles II had in France been familiar with the custom of having\r\nwomen on the stage, and when he issued his two patents to Davenant\r\nand Killigrew he inserted the famous clause, \"We do permit and\r\ngive leave from this time to come that all women's parts be acted\r\nby women.\" Mrs. Coleman had taken the part of Ianthe in Davenant's\r\n_Siege of Rhodes_ in 1656, but this was not a regular play. It was\r\nmore of the nature of an opera or spectacle. The first woman to\r\nact on the public stage in England was probably the actress who\r\nplayed Desdemona, December 8, 1660. \"J. Jordan\" wrote a prologue to\r\nintroduce her as \"the first woman that came to act on the stage,\" but\r\nhe did not give her name.[139]\r\n\r\nThe theatrical novelty initiated by this unknown actress was\r\nfar-reaching in its effects. Through the ensuing years a constantly\r\nincreasing number of women followed the lure of the stage. No\r\nother opportunity open to the ambition of women met with so eager\r\na response, or could number so many aspirants, or could register\r\nsuccess so unqualified. Yet as we read of these early English\r\nactresses we hardly think of acting as a profession or of them as\r\nartists. They were in no sense students of the parts they played.\r\nBeauty, youth, high spirits, a certain native endowment of wit or\r\nboldness, ability to sing a song or dance a jig, seemed to meet all\r\nthe demands of audiences too much delighted with the mere fact of\r\nseeing women on the stage to be over-critical of their technique\r\nor interpretation. Moreover, the runs of plays were short, three\r\ndays being about the average, so there was hardly time to work up\r\nfinished productions. The stage tenure of most of the actresses was\r\nalso brief, hardly more than a prelude to the social and domestic\r\nirregularities of their later lives. Cunningham names Mrs. Betterton\r\nas the only actress of Charles II's day who was not mistress to some\r\nman at court. \"Frailties,\" as they were euphemistically called,\r\nbecame so normally associated with actresses that Anne Bracegirdle\r\nexcited incredulous surprise by her reputed purity of life, and\r\nshe was presented by the noblemen of her day with a purse of eight\r\nhundred guineas in recognition of her virtue.[140] The immorality of\r\nthese early actresses, girls of no rigorous professional training\r\nand no professional standards, is quite intelligible. In appearing\r\nbefore the public at all they broke so many conventions, defied the\r\nfeminine ideal so completely, that a few steps further in pursuit of\r\nflattery and luxurious living hardly seemed to count. As actresses\r\nthey were at once under a moral stigma anyhow, so far as the soberer\r\npart of the community was concerned, and they naturally followed the\r\npath of least resistance and accepted the morality of the court of\r\nthe merry monarch, a court where virtue with her \"lean and scare-crow\r\nface\" seldom intruded. The unfortunate outcome of the turpitude of\r\nthe Restoration actresses is that they built up in the public mind a\r\nprejudice against actresses as a class, a prejudice which affected\r\nlater even such women as Mrs. Betterton, Mrs. Bracegirdle, Mrs.\r\nCibber, or Mrs. Siddons. But it must not be forgotten that they\r\nserved the cause of women by opening the way to a new and important\r\nprofession, a profession in which women have no handicaps. The stage\r\nhas been represented by more women of genius, and has given to women\r\nmore unstinted recognition in fame and money, than have any of the\r\nother forms of public activity into which women have so far been\r\nadmitted, except, possibly, in late years, administrative work in\r\nsocial service.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, in this study, to carry the account of the\r\nactresses into further detail, or further down the century. The\r\nhistory of the part women took on the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncentury stage would make a volume of itself. And since it was many\r\nyears before acting was connected with any critical or intellectual\r\nconception of the plays represented, it may suffice here to leave\r\nthis portion of the new work of women with the mere announcement of\r\nits inception.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISTS\r\n\r\nTo acting we may add another new realm, that of painting. The\r\nearliest woman portrait-painter on record in England is Anne\r\nCarlisle, who died about 1680. In 1658 Sir William Sanderson, in his\r\n_Graphice_, commenting on the artists then in England, said, \"And in\r\nOyl Colours we have a vertuous example in that worthy Artist, Mrs.\r\nCarlisle.\" In the notes left by Vertue to Walpole was a statement\r\nthat he had seen in about 1730 the portrait Mrs. Carlisle had painted\r\nof herself. Her chief work was in copying the paintings of Italian\r\nmasters, or, according to a fashion of the times, reproducing them in\r\nminiature. It is said that Charles I admired her work so warmly that\r\nhe presented to her and Van Dyck ultramarine to the value of five\r\nhundred pounds.[141]\r\n\r\nOf more distinguished ability was Mary Beale (1637-1697),[142] who\r\nis said to have studied either with Sir Peter Lely or Robert Walker.\r\nAt least she watched Lely paint and thereby gained some of his\r\ntechnique. She worked in oils, water-colors, and crayons. Through\r\nSir Peter Lely she was given access to some of the best works of Van\r\nDyck and in copying these gained a training somewhat similar to that\r\ngiven most artists by sojourns in Italy or Holland. There are in the\r\nEnglish National Portrait Gallery portraits by her of Charles II and\r\nAbraham Cowley. At Knole is her portrait of John Milton; at Woburn\r\nAbbey, one of the Duke of Monmouth; Archbishop Tillotson, Henry, Duke\r\nof Norfolk, Dr. Sydenham, Dr. Croone, Bishop Wilkins, are among those\r\nwho sat to her. No other English portrait-painter of the period had\r\nso distinguished a clientèle or is represented by so many canvases\r\nin English galleries. Her success may be measured, in part, by her\r\nfinancial returns. In a pocket-book kept by her husband in 1672 is\r\nthis entry: \"Received this year, for pictures done by my dearest\r\nheart, 202_l._ 5_s._\" The receipts for 1674 were 216_l._ 5_s._; and\r\nfor 1677, 429_l._ She was still painting important portraits in\r\n1691, for we find in the _Term Catalogue_ for Michaelmas of that\r\nyear the announcement of \"The true Effigies of his Grace, John, Lord\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury. Engraven by Rob. White on a large sheet of\r\nPaper, from the Original lately painted by Mrs. Mary Beale.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the manuscript of Mr. Oldys, Mrs. Beale was also\r\ncelebrated for her poetry. He styles her, \"that masculine poet, as\r\nwell as Painter, the incomparable Mrs. Beale.\" Dr. Woodford included\r\nin his translations of the Psalms several versions by Mrs. Beale whom\r\nhe eulogizes as \"an absolutely compleat Gentlewoman,\" and to whom he\r\nwrote several poems under the name \"Beliza.\"[143]\r\n\r\nAnne Killigrew (1660-1685), a maid of honor to Mary of Modena, died\r\nat twenty-five, but she had already attained considerable repute\r\nas a portrait painter. There is a tradition that she studied with\r\nSir Peter Lely. If so she must have taken these lessons before she\r\nwas twenty, for Lely left England in 1680. Dryden says that her\r\nportrait of James II expressed \"not only his outward part, but\r\ndrew forth the very image of his heart,\" and that she was equally\r\nsuccessful in depicting the bright beauty and peerless majesty of\r\nMary of Modena. Her portrait of herself was engraved by Becket and\r\nprefaces the volume of her poems issued the year after her death.\r\nOther paintings were religious in subject, as in her portrayal of\r\nincidents in the life of John the Baptist; or mythological, as in her\r\nrepresentation of Diana's nymphs. Of far more possible significance\r\nis her landscape work. During 1660-1685 Robert Streater is the only\r\nEnglish landscape-painter of whom we have record. Charles II brought\r\nover a number of Italian and Flemish artists who painted English\r\nlandscapes in the style of Ruysdael, Poussin, or Salvator Rosa, and\r\ntheir work would be the pictures chiefly known at court. It is not\r\nimprobable that Miss Killigrew's landscapes were copies or imitations\r\nof these foreign artists. Dryden says she painted ruins of Greece and\r\nRome, and forest glades in which were nymphs and shaggy satyrs. Such\r\npictures must have been copies. But Dryden also enumerates sylvan\r\nscenes of herds and flocks; clear, shallow little brooks; deep rivers\r\nreflecting as in a mirror the trees on their banks. Such pictures\r\nare truly English in tone and whatever their intrinsic value such a\r\nchoice of subjects would put her with Robert Streater at the very\r\ninception of English landscape art. And though the scanty records\r\nconcerning her painting do not substantiate Dryden's description\r\nof her landscapes, it could hardly be supposed that he would have\r\nbeen so explicit in a poem written for the family and immediately\r\nafter her death had there not been some pictures at least moderately\r\ncorrespondent to his lines.[144]\r\n\r\nOther seventeenth-century names of less importance show an aspiration\r\nin art somewhat above that countenanced by the boarding-schools.\r\nMrs. Pepys and Miss Margaret Pen may serve to indicate the sort\r\nof work being done in amateurish fashion in various homes. Both\r\nladies were \"learning to limn\" with one Mr. Browne. Pepys was\r\ntremendously interested in his wife's progress. In the midst of\r\nterrifying accounts of the plague and the fire there come in 1665\r\nand 1666 frequent notes on her pictures. Once after a week's absence\r\non exhausting work he records, \"To my wife, and having viewed her\r\nlast piece of drawing since I saw her which is seven or eight days,\r\nwhich pleases me beyond anything in the world, to bed with great\r\ncontent, but weary.\" The next day, on being importuned to buy her a\r\npearl necklace, he promises it, but only \"if she pleases me in her\r\npainting.\" On one occasion he called on Lady Pen and says of the\r\nvisit, \"Talking with Mrs. Pegg Pen, and looking at her pictures,\r\nand commended them; but, Lord! so far short of my wife's as no\r\ncomparison.\" A month later is the note, \"I took my Lady Pen home,\r\nand her daughter Pegg and, after dinner I made my wife show them\r\nher pictures, which did mad Pegg Pen, who learnes of the same man.\"\r\nIn September, 1665, Pepys had just seen his wife's picture of our\r\nSaviour and thought it so pretty that he boasted of it to Evelyn,\r\nat which Evelyn paid him in kind by telling him that \"the beautiful\r\nMrs. Middleton is rare (in painting) and his own wife do brave\r\nthings.\"[145]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. ANNE KILLIGREW\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by herself engraved by T. Chambars]\r\n\r\nThe Evelyn family seems to have been instinctively artistic. In\r\nMr. Thoresby's account of a visit to Evelyn, he said he was shown\r\n\"many drawings and paintings of his own and his lady's doing; one\r\nespecially of enamel was surprisingly fine, and this ingenious lady\r\ntold me how she wrought it.\" Both Mr. Evelyn and his son Draper were\r\nproud of Mary's work in painting. Sixteen years after her death Mr.\r\nThoresby wrote: \"He afterwards carried me in his coach to his son\r\nDraper's at the Temple, and showed me many curious pieces of his\r\ningenious daughter's performances, both very small in miniature,\r\nand as large as the life in oil colours, equal it is thought to the\r\ngreatest masters of the age. He gave me a specimen of some prospects\r\nhe took in Italy, and etched upon the copper by his own hand.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the century is Sarah Curtis (d. 1743) who was married\r\nin 1701 to Bishop Hoadly. Before her marriage she had been a pupil\r\nof Mary Beale, and she is now represented in the National Portrait\r\nGallery by three canvases, portraits of Burnet, Winston, and Hoadly.\r\nMrs. Rowe's paintings were likewise highly prized by discriminating\r\nfriends. Of greater interest is Mrs. Delany (1700-1788). She copied\r\nat least seventy-two pictures by old masters and painted many\r\nportraits. Her work is not represented in public galleries, but many\r\nof her pictures are still preserved in private collections. Susan\r\nPenelope Gibson was a successful miniature painter. Elizabeth Creed\r\nwas also an artist of at least local repute. She did sacred subjects\r\nas altar-pieces for neighboring churches and she painted numerous\r\nportraits. She also gave free lessons to the girls living near her.\r\nHer daughter Elizabeth, who inherited her artistic tastes, is said to\r\nhave ornamented a hall in a Tudor mansion near Oundle.\r\n\r\nShort and insignificant as this list appears, it yet assumes real\r\nimportance when we realize not only that these were the earliest\r\nEnglish women to enter this field, but that the list shows up\r\nsurprisingly well when compared with a similar list of the native\r\nEnglish painters among the men of the period. Charles I was a great\r\nlover of art and he summoned many artists, some of the first rank, to\r\nEngland, and he bought pictures with a far-sighted munificence, and\r\nCharles II was ambitious of following along the same distinguished\r\npath. But a list of the pictures painted in England before 1700 shows\r\nhardly an English name. Hence the presence of any successful women\r\nartists is doubly significant.\r\n\r\nThe amateurish quality of the painting may be in part explained by\r\nthe fact that in but one case, that of Mary Beale, was there any\r\nimpetus or training such as are necessarily associated with work\r\nadopted as a profession. The painting was an accomplishment, a\r\npleasant occupation for leisure hours, a resource, rather than a life\r\npurpose ardently pursued. The only external reward for the many hours\r\nat the easel was the praise of a small circle of friends. The real\r\nincentive was an inner demand for some form of self-expression, and\r\nthe mere number of pictures painted, quite apart from the question\r\nof their excellence, is indicative of the eagerness with which women\r\nwelcomed any sort of opportunity for the free play of their own\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORS\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, acting or painting that occupied most of the\r\nwomen whose natures craved something out of the ordinary routine.\r\nWriting was a much more natural and feasible resource. Acting\r\nimplied a public, and even painting, especially portrait-painting,\r\nwas likely to be semi-public. But writing could be carried on in\r\nretirement and the results submitted only to the partial criticism\r\nof a home or social circle. It did not bring women before a carping\r\npublic or necessarily into competition with men, for even if plays\r\nwere produced and books published, the name of the writer could be\r\nveiled, as it usually was, under a decent anonymity. Hence women who\r\nrespected the obvious conventions could yet indulge themselves in\r\nauthorship.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITERS ON PRACTICAL SUBJECTS\r\n\r\nWhen women entered upon writing as a career, it might be thought that\r\nthey would at first take up subjects familiar to them, but such was\r\nnot the case. For instance, most of the books for children, before\r\nthe venture of the Newberys about the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, were by men.[146] It was James Janeway whose maxim, \"A child\r\nis never too little to go to Hell,\" resulted in works so popular as\r\n_A Looking Glass for Children_ and _A Token for Children_ (1676);\r\nJohn Bunyan's _A Book for Boys and Girls, or Country Rimes for\r\nChildren; being Divine Poems on the Creed, Commonwealth and Several\r\nother Subjects_ (1690); Mr. Mason's _A Little Catechism with little\r\nVerses and little sayings, for little children_ (1693). _The Divine\r\nand Moral Songs for Children_, by Isaac Watts in 1720, carried on the\r\nreligious instruction. There were also various accounts of the \"Life\r\nand Saintly Death\" of children of tender years, which were published\r\nwith the avowed purpose of influencing other children of like tender\r\nyears, but none of these are by women. The first women I have come\r\nupon who wrote professedly for children are Sarah Fielding and Mrs.\r\nCollyer in 1749.[147]\r\n\r\nIn a somewhat less degree the same condition exists in relation\r\nto medicine, especially in the realms most definitely in the hands\r\nof women. Mrs. Pilkington tells us that her father was the first\r\nman midwife in England, but nearly all the books on midwifery were\r\nwritten by men. Two women, however, appear in print, in a discussion\r\nof their professional work. Mrs. Jane Sharp's book is entitled _The\r\nMidwives' Book, or the whole Art of midwifery discovered, directing\r\nChild-bearing Women how to behave themselves in their Conception,\r\nBreeding, Bearing, and Nursing, of Children. In Six Books. By Mrs.\r\nJane Sharp, Practitioner in the Art of Midwifery above thirty\r\nyears_.[148]\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cellier, a second writer on midwifery, is known\r\nperhaps chiefly because she was supposed to have some connection\r\nwith the Meal Tub Plot. After her acquittal from treason charges she\r\nwrote a pamphlet called _Malice Defeated_, in which she courageously\r\nexpressed her adherence to an unpopular cause in the words, \"I do not\r\nyet so much fear the smell of Newgate as to be frighted for telling\r\nthe truth; nor is death so great a terror to me, but that I am still\r\nready to seal the same with my blood.\"[149] She must have been a\r\nwoman of substance as well as courage, for she was fined a thousand\r\npounds because of certain passages in this pamphlet. She was also\r\ncondemned to stand in the pillory three times, a punishment which,\r\naccording to Lady Russell, she bore with intrepidity and nonchalance,\r\nprotecting her head from missiles by means of a battledore which she\r\nheld up with one hand, while with the other she gathered up and put\r\ninto her pocket all the stones that fell within her reach.\r\n\r\nIn her profession of midwifery Mrs. Cellier was of high repute, but\r\nher interests were not circumscribed by her own practice. One of\r\nher schemes was the establishment of a \"Colledg of Midwives\" where\r\nthe best possible training should be given. Though her pamphlet,\r\nentitled _A Scheme for the Foundation of a Royal Hospital and raising\r\na revenue of 5000 l or 6000 l a year by and for the Maintenance of a\r\nCorporation of Skilful Midwives_, did not result in the establishment\r\nof her proposed college, the idea and the formulation of the plan do\r\ncredit to her foresight and intelligence, and sound quite in line\r\nwith modern forms of woman's civic enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries could show a long list\r\nof interesting and elaborately worked-out books on housewifery in\r\ngeneral and cooking in particular, but it seldom happens that one\r\nof these books is by a woman. It is, to be sure, not impossible\r\nthat more of the material was furnished by women than is apparent\r\non the surface. Very many of the books on housekeeping matters were\r\nanonymous and were probably mere publishers' compilations from\r\nunacknowledged sources, and in such cases the actual material may\r\nhave come from various housewives. But during the century I have\r\ncome upon but three women who published under their own names the\r\nresults of their experiences as cooks. The earliest of these was Mrs.\r\nHannah Woolley. She was born about 1623. Her mother and elder sisters\r\nare said to have been \"very well skilled in physick and chirurgery\"\r\nand they taught her in her youth. She was twice married, the first\r\ntime to a schoolmaster named Woolley, and then to a Mr. Francis\r\nChallinor. She is known usually as Mrs. Woolley. One of her books,\r\n_The Queen-like Closet, or A rich Cabinet stored with all manner of\r\nrare Receipts for preserving, Candying, and Cookery. Very pleasant\r\nand beneficial to all ingenuous persons of the Female Sex_, reached\r\nits eleventh edition by 1696. Mrs. Woolley had been governess in two\r\nnoble families and had acquired definite ideas as to polite behavior.\r\nThis knowledge also she committed to the printed page. On manners,\r\nbut especially on household management, she wrote as an authority and\r\nreceived due recognition.\r\n\r\nAnother book, by a woman whose initials I have not been able to\r\nexpand into a name, is the following: _The Cook's New Years Gift,\r\nCookery refined, or The Lady, Gentlewoman and Servant-maid's\r\nCompanion: containing the Art of dressing all sorts of Flesh, Fish,\r\nand Fowl, various ways, after the newest Mode; with their proper\r\nseasonings, sauces, Garnishes, serving up and carving, etc. By Mrs.\r\nA. M. a long practiser of this curious Art._ (_Term Catalogues_,\r\nMich. 1697. Mich. 1700.)\r\n\r\nThe work of Mrs. Woolley in the seventeenth century found its most\r\nworthy counterpart in the eighteenth century in Hannah Glasse's _The\r\nArt of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, which far exceeds any Thing of\r\nthe kind ever yet Published.... By a Lady. London. Printed for the\r\nAuthor; and sold at Mrs. Ashburn's, a China-Shop, the Corner of Fleet\r\nDitch, 1747._ The book was issued with about two hundred subscribers.\r\nA fourth edition in octavo came out in 1751, a ninth edition in 1759,\r\nand many later editions. In her Preface Mrs. Glasse said, \"If I have\r\nnot wrote in the high polite Stile I hope I shall be forgiven, for\r\nmy Intention is to instruct the lower Sort, therefore treat them in\r\ntheir own Way. For Example: when I bid them lard a Fowl, if I should\r\nbid them lard with large Lardoons, they would not know what I want:\r\nBut when I say they must lard with small Pieces of Bacon, they know\r\nwhat I mean.\" The new element in her book was this attempt to write\r\nout receipts that were simple enough to come into general use.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITERS ON RELIGION AND THEOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe _Term Catalogues_ for 1670-1713 show how great was the\r\npreponderance during those years of books on \"Divinity.\" That women\r\nshould share in this prevailing interest is but natural, for religion\r\ncame within the accepted canon of the truly feminine. And there are\r\nevidences of an even greater amount of devotional writing by women\r\nthan might be expected. The period 1650 to 1750, and especially the\r\nfirst half of that period, could show a long list of women noted for\r\nlives of piety and good works.[150] The loose living characteristic\r\nof the court apparently had its reaction towards exceptional\r\nspiritual rigor on the part of many ladies of rank. And of these\r\ndevout ladies no small number found in the composition of religious\r\nverse or prose the intellectual and emotional outlet denied them in\r\nother ways. Almost none of this writing was meant for a public. The\r\nreams of meditations, prayers, and reflections left in manuscript\r\nwere merely a private resource, and often kept secret even from the\r\nauthor's family. Such writings were in their nature fugitive, and it\r\nwould only now and then happen that some relative or friend would\r\ncollect and order the papers and see them through the press. We\r\naccordingly get scattered hints through funeral sermons and casual\r\nnotices of an amount of devotional writing greatly in excess of that\r\npublished. But to tabulate even all the published material would be\r\nwearisome and to no good end. A few illustrative examples showing the\r\nchief characteristics may suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lady Elizabeth Brooke (1601-1683)]\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of the persistent and prodigious industry\r\nshown by some of these ladies is the work of Lady Elizabeth Brooke.\r\nShe began at thirty to make notes on sermons, to copy extracts from\r\ncommentaries, and occasionally to write out some personal opinions,\r\nand she kept at this sedative occupation till her death fifty-two\r\nyears later. It is painful to reflect on such a mass of undigested\r\nmaterial, but the significant fact remains that she preferred such\r\nreading and writing to the ordinary interests of her sex. Some of her\r\n\"Observations and Rules for Practice\" were published as an appendix\r\nto the sermon preached at her funeral. Selections from her writings\r\nwere published as late as 1828 in _The Lady's Monitor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne Murray, Lady Halkett (1622-1699)]\r\n\r\nAnne Murray, Lady Halkett, was even more industrious. Her father,\r\nwho was tutor of Charles I and Provost of Eton, died when she was a\r\nchild, but her mother, who was governess to the Princess Elizabeth,\r\ngave her \"a complete education.\" Of her early life she says: \"My\r\nmother spared no expense in educating all her children in the most\r\nsuitable way to improve them ... and paid masters for teaching\r\nmy sister and mee to write, speak French, play on the lute and\r\nvirginalls, and dance, and kept a gentlewoman to teach us all kinds\r\nof needlework, which shows I was not brought up in an idle life.\"\r\nAfter several complicated and long drawn-out love affairs--fully\r\ndescribed in her _Autobiography_--Anne married Sir James Halkett\r\nin 1656. As the years passed her interests finally centered on\r\ntwo subjects, divinity and medicine. In \"physick and surgery\" she\r\ngained great repute. She was consulted in difficult cases from the\r\nremotest parts of the kingdom and her fame spread even to Holland.\r\nIt was quaintly said of her: \"She was ever employed either in doing\r\nor reaping good: in the summer season she vyed with the bee or ant,\r\nin gathering herbs, flowers, worms, snails, etc., for the still or\r\nlimbeck, for the mortar or boyling pan, etc., and was ordinarily\r\nthen in a dress fitted for her still-house; making preparations of\r\nextracted waters, spirits, ointments, conserves, salves, powders,\r\netc., which she ministered every Wednesday to a multitude of poor\r\ninfirm persons, besides what she dayly sent abroad to persons of all\r\nranks who consulted her in their maladies.\"[151] But it was religious\r\nthemes only that employed her pen. The catalogue of her writings\r\nincludes twenty-one volumes, or a total of about eight thousand pages\r\nof manuscript, some in quarto, some in folio size, and all bound.\r\nSome of these books were printed at Edinburgh in 1701. The title\r\nof one book of three hundred and fifteen pages will indicate the\r\ngeneral character of her writing: _Select Meditations and Prayers\r\nupon the First Week, with Observations on each Days Creation, and\r\nConsiderations on the Seven Capital Vices to be opposed, and their\r\nopposite Virtues to be studied and practised_.\r\n\r\n  _Vices to be subdued_                 _Virtues to be learned_\r\n  _Pride_                 Sunday        _Humility_\r\n  _Covetousness_          Monday        _Contentation_\r\n  _Lust_                  Tuesday       _Chastity_\r\n  _Envy_                  Wednesday     _Charity_\r\n  _Gluttony_              Thursday      _Temperance_\r\n  _Anger_                 Friday        _Patience_\r\n  _Sloth_                 Saturday      _Diligence_\r\n\r\nAll but nine of these books were written during Lady Halkett's\r\ntwenty-eight years of widowhood when she had much leisure, but under\r\nany circumstances the task was a great one, and becomes the more\r\namazing when we reflect upon it as really only a private recreation.\r\nTo write so much with no urgency of fame or money shows some very\r\nstrong inner demand for expression and a very facile pen.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Legacies\"]\r\n\r\nAnother type of religious book goes back for its inspiration to\r\nElizabeth Jocelyn's famous _Legacie_. One of Lady Halkett's books\r\nwas _The Mother's Will to an Unborn Child_, written in 1656 before\r\nthe birth of her daughter Elizabeth. Books of advice from parents to\r\nchildren to be read after the death of the parents were not uncommon.\r\nElizabeth Sadler (1623-1690), the wife of the Reverend Anthony\r\nWalker, was an exceedingly devout woman whose literary instinct and\r\na prevision of death led her to write a large book in octavo for the\r\ninstruction of her two daughters. Two other books will sufficiently\r\nillustrate the type: _The Experiences of God's gracious dealing with\r\nMrs. Elizabeth White, late wife of Mr. Tho. White of Caldecot in the\r\nCounty of Bucks; as they were written under her own hand, and found\r\nin her Closet after her decease: she dying in child-bed, December\r\n5th, 1669_;[152] _The Legacie of a Dying Mother to her mourning\r\nchildren; being the Experiences of Mistress Susanna Bell, who died\r\nMarch 13, 1672. With an Epistle Dedicatory by Thomas Brookes,\r\nMinister of the Gospel_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rachel Wriothesley, Lady Russell (1636-1723)]\r\n\r\nLady Russell is an example of a woman who definitely set out to be\r\nreligious, and whose writings contain an analysis of her methods.\r\nThe circumstances of her life give everything pertaining to her a\r\nparticular interest. The execution of Lord Russell for treason in\r\n1683 left her broken by the shock. She had, though without avail,\r\nset in motion every possible agency to avert his fate, and she had\r\ndevoted herself absolutely to him till his tragic death. Then,\r\nafter a period of the deepest despondency, she entered again upon\r\nthe duties that lay before her. She conducted the education and\r\narranged the marriages of her three children. She showed herself an\r\nexcellent business woman in the management of her estate. And she\r\nsteadily interested herself in securing benefices and other offices\r\nfor persons of whom her husband would have approved. Her _Letters_\r\nas published contain a few during the first years of her happy\r\nmarried life; many written concerning the \"judicial murder\" of Lord\r\nRussell; and very many concerning family affairs and the candidates\r\nfor whom she was seeking favor. As letters they are uninteresting.\r\nThe subject-matter is generally too local and temporary to hold the\r\nattention of the modern reader, and the style is dry and hard. Even\r\nthe records of her bitter grief and of her struggle to attain a mood\r\nof Christian resignation are less affecting than might be expected.\r\nA kind of apathy seemed to settle down over her spirit. She was too\r\ndeeply hurt to find in words any balm for her sorrows. She answered\r\ncondolences when she must, but briefly, and with no lightening of the\r\ngloom that encompassed her. Of all her letters the longest and most\r\nvaluable as a personal revelation is one written to her children July\r\n21, 1691, \"a day of sad remembrances,\" for it was the anniversary\r\nof her husband's execution eight years before. In 1691, Rachel, the\r\noldest child, was twenty years old, and Wriothesley, the youngest,\r\nwas eleven. The five or six pages in which Lady Russell recounts,\r\nprobably especially for the benefit of Rachel, her method of personal\r\nspiritual watch-care, has great value as a religious document,\r\nfor she was not alone in her way of seeking salvation, in her\r\nheart-searchings, in her dependence on the external means of grace,\r\nin her sedulous striving after perfection. It was the devout habit of\r\ndevout people of the time, but perhaps carried to a meticulous excess\r\nby Lady Russell. She says that she was always provided with a little\r\npiece of paper on which she wrote her faults and temptations as they\r\noccurred during the day. At night a careful review of this record\r\ncontributed to a better watch and ward.\r\n\r\n  And then [she continued], upon Friday morning when I have prayed\r\n  my usual daily prayers (which have bin most constantly for\r\n  many years those in taler's holy living) before I pray that of\r\n  intercession pa: 35. I stop ... and look upon my dayly notes for\r\n  that weeke, I recollect my fautes; consider what care I have\r\n  taken to correct or forsake them--but alas when we do best we\r\n  shall find enof to be humbled for--therefore I chuse some prayer\r\n  of confesion most times that in taler's holy living page 302.\r\n  When I have done it, I make my resolutions to do better for ye\r\n  time to come, and especialy to watch myselfe where i ame most\r\n  apt to fal, naming in what I ame so--then I pray some prayer\r\n  for grace to keep these promises of better obedience--as in\r\n  pa: 31--for grace to spend our time wel, on page 271, for the\r\n  grace of faith, hope & charity. Then I pray the dayly prayer of\r\n  intercession that I left of at in pa:35--after this I praise\r\n  God ... for all the blessings vouchsafed to me both spiritual &\r\n  temporal--as that I was born of Christian parents, not suffered\r\n  to be strangled in the womb, that I was baptized, and sence,\r\n  educated in Christian Religion. I blesse thee for al checks of\r\n  Conscience I have had especially those I have profited by....\r\n  And then I goe on, I bless thee for our creation, preservation\r\n  &c.--close with ye lords prayer.\r\n\r\nAfter this service she went over her faults of the week, making a\r\nsummary of them. A similar abridgment for the month was entered in\r\na book kept for that purpose, the incriminating little pieces of\r\npaper were torn up, and a new record entered upon. She found that a\r\nfrequent re-reading of the book \"saved much time in looking back\"\r\nand contributed to humility. Evidently Lady Russell was as orderly\r\nin religion as she was in her business affairs. She finds her\r\ndefinite tabulations \"hugely more satisfying to her mind, than a more\r\ncarelesse loose way of living is, and no settled method.\" The letter\r\ncloses with the admonition, \"Be devout & reguler in your dutys\r\nto God--heaven wil be secure, and pleasures innocent.\"[153] Lady\r\nRussell's letters reveal a devout, difficult, over-burdened life, so\r\nmuch concerned with the means of grace as never to have any happy\r\nconsciousness of grace itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elizabeth Blake, Mrs. Burnet (1661-1712)]\r\n\r\nElizabeth Burnet (1661-1712), daughter of Sir Richard Blake, married\r\nat seventeen into a Catholic family. Her husband, Robert Berkeley,\r\nwas a ward of Bishop Fell, through whom the marriage was brought\r\nabout. The firmness and tact necessary to maintain her own views as a\r\nProtestant and hold her husband to that faith, and yet not antagonize\r\nthe family, could hardly be expected of so young a girl. But Bishop\r\nFell had judged her character well and she met all the demands of so\r\ndelicate a situation. She took advantage of many leisure hours in\r\nthe country to investigate fully the questions at issue between the\r\nCatholics and the Protestants. She did not know the learned tongues,\r\nbut she studied the Scriptures, read commentaries, and conversed\r\nwith clergymen. When she became a widow in 1693, at thirty-two, she\r\nemployed her time in two characteristic ways. In the administration\r\nof her husband's charitable schemes she found congenial activity.\r\nAnd she gave way to her natural instinct for writing. In 1700 she\r\nbecame the wife of Bishop Burnet. His approval of her literary work\r\nand his request that it be published led to the production of her\r\n_Method of Devotion_. It was so popular that she revised and enlarged\r\nit and brought out a second edition. And it was republished in 1713\r\nafter her death. The book contained \"Rules for holy and devout\r\nLiving,\" \"Prayers on Several Occasions,\" \"Advices and Devotions on\r\nthe Holy Sacrament.\" Mrs. Trotter said of her in 1701, \"She has an\r\nextraordinary clear and solid judgment, the truest goodness and\r\nprudence, and the most charming affability in her behaviour; in\r\nshort, I have met with no such perfection in any of my sex.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elizabeth Bury (1644-1720)]\r\n\r\nElizabeth Bury was another young woman whose bright, acquisitive\r\nmind resented conventional inactivity and put out tentacles in all\r\ndirections for knowledge. Philology, philosophy, history, heraldry,\r\ngeography, mathematics, were among her interests. She contended\r\nthat souls were of no sex and that women were often \"disposed to\r\nan accurate search into things curious and profitable, as well as\r\nothers.\" She studied anatomy and medicine until she had gained \"a\r\nsurprizing knowledge of the human body, and of the _Materia Medica_,\"\r\nso that she could state the symptoms of the most difficult and\r\nintricate cases in the physician's own terms. She learned French that\r\nshe might talk with French refugees to whom she was a benefactress.\r\nHer correspondence and conversation were both highly prized. But all\r\nthese interests must be counted merely as diversions. \"Her constant\r\nfavourite and darling study was divinity.\" The Bible, Mr. Henry's\r\n_Annotations_, a few works on practical divinity, and a competent\r\nnumber of Hebrew books made up her working library. Hebrew because of\r\nits scriptural importance was the subject on which she concentrated\r\nher attention and she was reputed to have a critical knowledge of\r\nits idioms and peculiarities. It was said that she could even quote\r\nthe original in common conversation if the elucidation of some text\r\nwere in question. As the years passed, books and writing, \"morning\r\nhours with God,\" and many arduous charitable duties so fully occupied\r\nher that she found mere social life an unrewarded tax. Of ordinary\r\nconversation she said that though one might strike fire \"it always\r\nfell on wet tinder.\" The mass of manuscripts found after her death\r\nreflected the variety of her interests, but the majority were on\r\ntopics such as _Meditations on the Divinity of the Holy Scriptures_,\r\n_The unreasonableness of Fretting against God_, and similar subjects.\r\nShe kept also a voluminous _Diary_, an abridgment of which was\r\npublished by her husband in Bristol in 1721. Mr. Watts's _Elegy_\r\nindicates something of the reverence with which Mrs. Bury was\r\nregarded by her contemporaries; and a woman of her personal charm,\r\nexecutive ability, alert responsiveness to the calls of charity,\r\nalong with her quick mind, and multifarious, if not always profound,\r\nlearning would take an even higher place in any organized community\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Susanna Hopton (1627-1709)]\r\n\r\nWomen also entered the less feminine fields of controversy. Susanna\r\nHopton is an interesting example. In her youth she had become a\r\nCatholic, but under the influence of her husband she entered upon a\r\nthorough study of the points at issue between the Catholics and the\r\nProtestants. Dr. Hickes says of her: \"She made herself as perfect\r\nin the controversie, as English writers could make her, who managed\r\nthe controversie on both sides. I have (says he) above twenty popish\r\nauthors, which she left me, and some of them with marginal notes in\r\nher own hand. She was well versed in Bishop Moreton's, Archbishop\r\nLaud's and Mr. Chillingworth's works, and Ranchin's _Review of\r\nthe Council of Trent_, etc.\"[154] As a result of this reading she\r\ndrew up a long and learned letter to Father Tuberville, showing\r\nhim why she had renounced the Church of Rome. This letter was\r\npublished by Dr. Hickes immediately after her death in his volume of\r\n_Controversial Letters_ in 1710. Mr. William said that she was an\r\nexcellent casuist and divine, and could encounter and confute all\r\nenemies of the church. \"Her discourse and stile upon serious matters\r\nwas strong, eloquent and nervous; upon pleasant subjects, witty\r\nand facetious: and when it required an edge was sharp as a razor.\"\r\n_Daily Devotions_, _Meditations on the Six Days Of Creation_, and\r\n_Meditations on the Life of Christ_ were her other works. As a wife,\r\na neighbor, and a friend she seems to have been in high esteem, but\r\nher life had the church as its center.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Damaris Cudworth, Lady Masham (1658-1708)]\r\n\r\nDamaris Cudworth and Mary Astell, two of the most gifted women of\r\nthe period, became involved in the theological discussion between\r\nJohn Norris and John Locke. Miss Cudworth knew both disputants well.\r\nAs a young woman she had corresponded with Norris on the subject of\r\n\"Platonic Love,\" and in 1689 he had dedicated to her his _Reflections\r\nupon the Conduct of Human Life, with reference to the study of\r\nlearning and knowledge_. But it was Locke who had a permanent\r\ninfluence on her opinions. While she was still in Cambridge with her\r\nfather, Ralph Cudworth, Locke taught her divinity and philosophy.\r\nAfter her marriage to Sir Francis Masham in 1685, Locke was a\r\nfrequent visitor at their home, and from 1691 till his death in 1704\r\nhe lived permanently with them. Her polemical articles were doubtless\r\nwritten under his inspiration. In 1694 the correspondence between\r\nMary Astell and John Norris was published, under the title, _Letters\r\nconcerning the Love of God_. Two years later Lady Masham answered\r\ntheir arguments in her _Discourse concerning the Love of God_,[155]\r\nwhich was attributed to Locke and answered by Norris. In 1700 Lady\r\nMasham published _Occasional Thoughts in reference to a virtuous\r\nChristian Life_, which is her closing word in the controversy.\r\n\r\nDamaris Cudworth was a woman of remarkable intellect. Her father\r\nwas delighted with the early manifestations of her power and he\r\ntook pride in securing for her the best possible education. The\r\ncurious epitaph on her tomb praises her learning, judgment, candor,\r\npenetration, and love of truth, and credits her with being a devoted\r\nand intelligent mother. It sums up her character in the statement,\r\nthat \"to the Softness and Elegancy of her own Sex\" she added \"several\r\nof the noblest Accomplishments and Qualities of the other,\" and that\r\n\"she possessed these advantages in a degree unusual to either.\" The\r\nconventional eulogy on a tomb is always open to suspicion, but in\r\nthis case the vague generalities of the epitaph fall below the truth.\r\nLocke, in a letter to Phillipp van Limborch, said of her: \"The Lady\r\nherself is so well versed in theological and philosophical studies\r\nand of such an original mind that you will not find many men to whom\r\nshe is not superior in wealth of knowledge and ability to profit by\r\nit. Her judgment is excellent, and I know few who can bring such\r\nclearness of thought to bear upon the most abstruse subjects, or such\r\ncapacity for searching through and solving the difficulties. I do not\r\nsay of most women, but even of most learned men.\"[156]\r\n\r\nLady Masham was also recognized as one of the early champions for\r\nwoman's education, for when Mary Astell's _Serious Proposal_ appeared\r\nanonymously in 1694 it was by some attributed to Lady Masham. She\r\ntook the subject up definitely in her _Occasional Thoughts_. After\r\ncommenting on the lack of knowledge of science, law, history,\r\npolitics, morals, and religion, of most English gentlemen, Lady\r\nMasham continued:\r\n\r\n  Thus wretchedly destitute of all that Knowledge which they ought\r\n  to have, are, generally speaking, our English gentlemen, and\r\n  being so, what wonder can it be, if they like not that women\r\n  should have knowledge; for this is a quality that will give some\r\n  sort of superiority even to those who care not to have it?... But\r\n  such men as these would assuredly find their account much better\r\n  therein, if tenderness of that prerogative would teach them a\r\n  more legitimate way of maintaining it, than such a one as is a\r\n  very great impediment or discouragement at the least, to others\r\n  in the doing what God requires of them. For it is an undesirable\r\n  truth that a lady who is able to give an account of her faith,\r\n  and to defend her religion against the attacks of the cavilling\r\n  wits of the age, or the abuses of the obtruders of vain opinions:\r\n  that is capable of instructing her children in the reasonableness\r\n  of the christian religion, and of laying in them the foundations\r\n  of a solid virtue: that a lady, I say, no more knowing than this\r\n  does demand, can hardly escape being called learned by the men\r\n  of our days, and in consequence thereof, becoming a subject of\r\n  ridicule to one part of them, and of aversion to the other; with\r\n  but a few exceptions of some virtuous and rational persons. And\r\n  is not the incurring of general dislike one of the strongest\r\n  discouragements we can have to any thing?[157]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grace Norton, Lady Gethin (1676-1696)]\r\n\r\nThere was published soon after Lady Gethin's death, from loose papers\r\nleft by her, a work entitled _Reliquiæ Gethinianæ_. Congreve's poem,\r\nentitled _Verses to the Memory of Lady Grace Gethin, occasioned by\r\nreading her Book_, speaks in high praise of her. He says the book\r\nshows all that study or time could teach.\r\n\r\n      But to what height must his amazement rise,\r\n      When, having read the work, he turns his eyes\r\n      Again to view the foremost opening page,\r\n      And there the beauty, sex, and tender age,\r\n      Of her beholds, in whose pure mind arose\r\n      Th' ethereal source, from whence the current flows.\r\n\r\nLady Gethin was counted a marvel of wisdom, but when we read her\r\n_Apothegms_ and _Essays_ and _Witty Sayings_ we are more impressed by\r\nher accurate memory of Bacon and other earlier essayists than by any\r\nprofound knowledge of life on her own part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Eleanor James (fl. 1685-1715)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Eleanor James[158] was a writer on religious and political\r\ntopics. No complete list of her works has ever been compiled. She\r\ngained publicity for her religious views by numerous single printed\r\nsheets between 1685 and 1715. John Dunton described her husband as\r\nbeing well known because he was an excellent printer, and \"something\r\nthe better known for being the husband of that she-state-politician,\r\nMrs. Eleanor James.\" She is said to have constituted herself a sort\r\nof \"adviser to reigning sovereigns\" from Charles II to George I, whom\r\nshe visited in turn for counsel and admonition. Her chief published\r\nworks are on religious controversy. Her _Vindication of the Church\r\nof England_ (1687) created considerable antagonism. In answer to a\r\nsatirical _Address of thanks to Mrs. James on behalf of the Church\r\nof England_ she wrote _Mrs. James's Defence_. A lady also appeared\r\nin the lists against her in a book entitled _Elizabeth Rowe's Short\r\nAnswer to Eleanor James's Long Preamble or Vindication of the\r\nnew Test_. Mrs. James's _Apology_ (1694) and her _Reasons humbly\r\npresented to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal_ (1715) complete the\r\nlist of her more important publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Newcome (fl. 1728)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Newcome's _Enquiry into the Evidences of the Christian Religion_\r\nwas published in 1728. Mr. Bowyer says that she was by every one\r\naccounted a most excellent and worthy woman, and that her learning\r\nwas attested by more than one volume. Mr. Grey mentioned her in his\r\n_Hudibras_ as \"the very learned lady\" who gave him the note about\r\nPenguins in Book I. Nichols quotes a Mr. \"T. F.\" who says that she\r\nhad great fame for learning, but adds cautiously: \"All that I know\r\nof that matter is, that as often as I have been in company with her,\r\nand when things were thrown out designedly to tempt her to speak,\r\nand discover herself, as the armour produced to Achilles, it never\r\ntook effect. So that I can not speak of her learning from my own\r\nknowledge; but if she was not that, she was something better, a very\r\ngood woman.\"[159]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catherine Trotter, Mrs. Cockburn (1679-1749)]\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished woman in the field of polemics in the first\r\nhalf of the eighteenth century was Catherine Trotter, better known as\r\nMrs. Cockburn. The contemporary recognition accorded Mrs. Cockburn\r\nis to-day the most surprising fact about her. Her father was a\r\nScotchman, a commander in the royal navy, and highly thought of by\r\nCharles II, but his death at sea in 1683, and many ensuing disastrous\r\nbusiness complications, left the family in serious financial\r\ndifficulties. Mrs. Trotter was, however, nearly related to the Duke\r\nof Lauderdale and the Earl of Perth, a fact which secured her social\r\nrecognition no matter how narrow her circumstances. Catherine, her\r\nyoungest child, began writing poetry at a very early age. She also\r\nearly showed unusual mental alertness, for \"she both learned to\r\nwrite and made herself mistress of the _French_ language, by her own\r\napplication and diligence, without any instructor.\" In Latin and\r\nLogic she had some guidance. Logic was so interesting to her that\r\nwhile still young she drew up an abstract of its principles, for her\r\nown use.\r\n\r\nCatherine's first extant poem was a thanksgiving in heroic verse\r\nfor the recovery of Mr. Bevil Higgons from small-pox. She was then\r\nfourteen, but the labored lines have a kind of heavy maturity\r\nprophetic of her later verse. In her seventeenth year she entered\r\nfully upon her literary career. For thirteen years she devoted\r\nherself to study and writing, and if applause from high authorities\r\ncould justify her serious preoccupation with things of the mind, such\r\njustification was hers in full measure. Before she was seventeen\r\nher tragedy, _Agnes de Castro_, was acted at Drury Lane. It was by\r\nthe advice of the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex that she had allowed\r\n\"this little off-spring of her early muse\"[160] to try its fortune in\r\nthe world, and such success as it had must be attributed largely to\r\nthe protection of influential patrons. But with or without patrons,\r\nwhatever Miss Trotter did was sure to win praise. When she wrote a\r\neulogistic poem to Congreve on his _Mourning Bride_, in 1697, he\r\nexpressed himself as heartily vexed that her lines came too late for\r\npublication with his play, and said of her poetical commendation, \"It\r\nis the first thing, that ever happened to me, upon which I should\r\nmake it my choice to be vain.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1698 there appeared, at the new theater in Lincoln's Inn Fields,\r\nMiss Trotter's second tragedy entitled _The Fatal Friendship_.\r\nMr. Betterton, Mr. Verbruggen, Mr. Thurmond, Mrs. Barry, and Mrs.\r\nBracegirdle, took the chief parts. The play ran several nights and\r\nwas seen occasionally on the stage until far down in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Its immediate success was great and the praise that poured\r\nin upon the nineteen-year-old author must have been bewilderingly\r\nsweet. Mr. Higgons evened up the score for the small-pox poem by some\r\nverses which declared her direct descent from Sappho. Mr. Harman said\r\nthat she maintained the true empire of the stage along with Congreve,\r\nGranville, and a few others \"well read in honour's school.\" From \"an\r\nunknown hand\" came a poem addressed to \"my much esteemed Friend.\"\r\nThis author writes of his consuming anxiety at the beginning of the\r\nplay, and of the joy that gushed forth as he observed its success.\r\nThe impression from his poem is that he had known the play intimately\r\nbefore its appearance. According to \"the elegant pen of Mr. John\r\nHughes\" Miss Trotter's \"virgin voice offends no virgin ear,\" her\r\nchaste thoughts and clean expressions set her nobly apart as a\r\nreformer of the stage, and she is a successful champion of her sex,\r\nsince her genius has destroyed the \"Salique law of wit\" established\r\nby men. So pleased was Mr. Farquhar with _The Fatal Friendship_\r\nthat he sent his first comedy _Love and a Bottle_, which had \"been\r\nscandalously aspersed for affronting the ladies,\" \"to stand its\r\ntryal before one of the fairest of the sex, and the best judge.\" And\r\nhe adds his thanks for the \"favour and honour\" she showed him by\r\nappearing on his third night. He concludes his letter with a double\r\ncompliment: \"But humbly to confess the greatest motive, my passions\r\nwere wrought so high by representation of _Fatal Friendship_, and\r\nsince raised so high by a sight of the beautiful author, that I\r\ngladly catched this opportunity of owning myself your most faithful\r\nand humble servant.\" Mrs. Manly also gave a generous tribute to her\r\nyoung fellow-aspirant for stage honors:\r\n\r\n      Orinda and the Fair Astrea gone\r\n      Not one was found to fill the Vacant Throne;\r\n      Aspiring Man had quite regain'd the Sway,\r\n      Again had Taught us humbly to Obey;\r\n      Till you (Nature's third start, in favour of our Kind)\r\n      With stronger Arms, their Empire have disjoyn'd, etc.\r\n\r\n          _Dela Manley_\r\n\r\nAfter _The Fatal Friendship_ Miss Trotter's work for the stage need\r\nnot be particularly dwelt upon. She had a comedy brought out at Drury\r\nLane in 1701. A new tragedy in the same year at Drury Lane, and a\r\ntragedy at the Haymarket in 1706, complete the list. Some occasional\r\npoems appeared during this period. In 1700 she was one of the nine\r\nladies who wrote on the death of Dryden, under the title _The Nine\r\nMuses; or Poems written by as many ladies on the death of the late\r\nfamous John Dryden, Esq._ In 1704 she entered the lists with Mr.\r\nAddison and Mr. John Philips in celebrating the victory of Blenheim,\r\nbut she did not venture to publish her poem till the manuscript had\r\nbeen submitted to the Duke of Marlborough. When the duke and the\r\nduchess and the lord treasurer Godolphin declared themselves \"greatly\r\npleased\" she sent her lines to the press.\r\n\r\nBesides her dramatic and poetical work Miss Trotter wrote in prose\r\non critical and theological subjects. An interesting disquisition on\r\n\"the poets of the last age\" appeared in the dedication of her _The\r\nUnhappy Penitent_ in 1701. Of Shakespeare, Dryden, Lee, and Otway she\r\nspeaks with independent judgment and considerable discrimination. But\r\nnone of the works so far listed are those on which her fame rested.\r\nIt was not in poetry, drama, or literary criticism that she found\r\nsatisfaction. Religion and philosophy were her true field. Locke's\r\n_Essay concerning Human Understanding_ was published in 1690, and\r\namong the antagonistic criticisms it called forth were three series\r\nof _Remarks_ published anonymously in 1697 and 1699. Young as she was\r\nMiss Trotter pursued the controversy with the keenest interest and in\r\n1701 she drew up a _Defence of The Essay of Human Understanding_. Mr.\r\nGeorge Burnet of Kemney, then in Holland, and Mrs. Burnet, the wife\r\nof Bishop Burnet, were entrusted with the secret of her _Defence_,\r\nand both advised anonymous publication, agreeing with her that her\r\nyouth and sex would, if known, count against a work of that nature.\r\nHer _Defence_ appeared in print in 1702. Mrs. Burnet on finding that\r\nthe Bishop, Mr. John Norris, and Mr. Locke himself, were highly\r\npleased with it, could keep the secret no longer.[161] Mr. Locke sent\r\nMiss Trotter a present of books and a letter in which he expressed\r\nhis gratitude for \"an opportunity to own you for my protectress,\r\nwhich is the greatest honour my Essay could have procured me. Give\r\nme leave therefore to assure you, that as the rest of the world take\r\nnotice of the strength and clearness of your reasoning, so I can not\r\nbut be extremely sensible, that it was employed in my behalf.\"[162]\r\n\r\nA second pamphlet was entitled _A discourse concerning a guide in\r\nControversies_ and grew out of her own spiritual conflicts. Although\r\nof a Protestant family she had become a Catholic early in life, but\r\nhad gradually found herself less and less in harmony with that church\r\ntill 1707 when, in this _Discourse_, she announced her return to the\r\nChurch of England.\r\n\r\nThe polemical years between 1701 and 1707 had been diversified by\r\nseveral love affairs. Mr. George Burnet of Kemney, Mr. Fenn who was\r\nan eloquent young clergyman,[163] Mr. Cockburn, \"and some others,\"\r\nare indicated in her letters. Miss Trotter's letters to two of\r\nthese lovers, Mr. Fenn and Mr. Burnet, are nearly as polemical as\r\nher _Defence_ and _Discourse_. She uses all her old Art of Logic\r\nto reason her lovers into friends. She had, in fact, no particular\r\nrespect for the passion of love as a factor in human life. She\r\napologized for having given it so important a place in her plays,\r\nfor it was \"not noble enough to fill a whole tragedy.\"[164] When\r\nMr. Burnet professed \"the most passionate ardour of mind and soul\"\r\nfor her,[165] she responded with a eulogy of \"just and beneficent\r\nfriendship.\" \"It is only that niggard passion, which is distinguish'd\r\nby the name of love, that excludes all but one object from having a\r\npart in it, and is not satisfied without monopolizing the affections\r\nof the heart.\"[166] She offered Mr. Burnet \"due gratitude\" and she\r\nsurely owed him some return for the pains he took to spread the\r\nfame of her works. He wrote so highly of her to the Princess Sophia\r\nthat the royal lady wrote in answer: \"_Je suis charmée du portrait\r\navantageux, que vous me faites de la nouvelle Sappho Ecossoise, qui\r\nsemble meriter les eloges, que vous luy donnez_.\"[167]\r\n\r\nMiss Trotter's letters to Mr. Cockburn, whom she married in 1708, are\r\nalso full of argument and business. If she had a deep affection for\r\nhim she certainly never allowed herself to speak out. She says that\r\ntheir chief aim in marriage was to assist each other in performing\r\nthose duties that flow from the love of God.[168] Of the ensuing\r\ntwenty years she wrote in 1738 as follows: \"Being married in 1708,\r\nI bid adieu to the muses, and so wholly gave myself up to the cares\r\nof a family, and the education of my children, that I scarce knew\r\nthere was any such thing as books, plays, or poems stirring in Great\r\nBritain.\"[169] It was an attack on Mr. Locke that again drew her\r\ninto public controversy. Dr. Winch Holdsworth published in 1720 a\r\nsermon on Mr. Locke's \"false reasonings\" against the resurrection\r\nof the same body. The sermon came to her hands some years later\r\nand she published in 1726-27 _A Letter to Dr. Holdsworth_. In 1727\r\nhe published _A Defence of the Doctrine of the Resurrection of the\r\nsame Body_. Her answer, _A Vindication of Mr. Locke's Christian\r\nPrinciples_, remained in manuscript till the publication of her\r\nworks in 1751. She also wrote in 1739 _Remarks upon some Writers in\r\nthe Controversy concerning the Foundation of Moral Duty and Moral\r\nObligation_ which was published in 1743 in _The History of the\r\nWorks of the Learned_. In 1747 she entered upon a confutation of\r\nDr. Rutherforth's _Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue_.\r\nHer _Remarks_ on this _Essay_ was published by Mr. Warburton with a\r\nlaudatory Preface in which he spoke of her \"fine genius,\" \"clearness\r\nof expression, strength of reason, precision of logic, and attachment\r\nto truth.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1731 to 1748 there is a series of letters between Mrs. Cockburn\r\nand Anne Hepburn (afterwards Mrs. Arbuthnot), her niece. It is\r\nalmost entirely a literary and religious correspondence and shows\r\nthat Miss Hepburn's interests were on almost as high a plane as her\r\naunt's. A list of the books they exchanged and commented on would\r\ninclude most of the important new works in England during the first\r\nhalf of the century. The most interesting literary taste revealed is\r\nMrs. Cockburn's partiality for Pope. In 1738 she wrote him a long\r\nletter in which she said, \"Your _Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot_, and\r\n_Essay on Man_, gave me some idea of your morals. But when I read\r\nyour private letters, where, as you express it, you _throw yourself\r\nout upon paper_, I thought I saw your heart open and undisguised. I\r\nwas charmed with the sincere, ingenuous, unsuspecting friend, the\r\nunwilling enemy, the benevolent mind, extending to all parties, all\r\nreligions, all mankind; the filial piety, the tender concern for\r\na mother's approaching death, at an age, when most men would have\r\nconsidered theirs only as a useless burden. In short, I saw so many\r\namiable qualities opening on every different occasion, that I began\r\nas much to admire the valuable man as the great genius.\" She chides\r\nhim gently for thinking too lightly of his genius, for while he is\r\nmeasuring syllables and coupling rhymes to such excellent moral\r\nends, she is ready to assure him of a final \"_Well done, thou good\r\nand faithful servant_.\" It is a pity this epistle was never sent. It\r\nwould doubtless have been almost as surprising to the wicked wasp\r\nof Twickenham as to the crowd of enemies for whose benefit he was\r\npreparing the _New Dunciad_.\r\n\r\nMr. Birch, who edited Mrs. Cockburn's _Works_ in 1751, said of her:\r\n\r\n  Posterity at least will be solicitious to know, to whom they\r\n  will owe the most demonstrative and perspicuous reasonings, upon\r\n  subjects of eternal importance; and her own sex is entitled to\r\n  the fullest information about one, who has done such honour to\r\n  them, and raised our ideas of their intellectual power, by an\r\n  example of the greatest extent of understanding and correctness\r\n  of judgment. Antiquity, indeed, boasted of its _female\r\n  philosophers_, whose merits have been drawn forth in an elaborate\r\n  treatise of _Menage_. [_Historia Mulierum Philosophorum_, 8vo.\r\n  Lyons, 1690.] But our own age and country may without injustice\r\n  or vanity oppose to those illustrious ladies the defender of\r\n  _Locke_ and _Clarke_; who, with a genius equal to the most\r\n  eminent of them, had the superior advantage of cultivating it in\r\n  the only effectual method of improvement, the study of a real\r\n  philosophy, and a theology worthy human nature, and its all\r\n  perfect author.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cockburn had a strong, clear, acute mind. The impression she\r\nmade on the best thinkers in her generation is due to this fact, and,\r\nfurther, to the fact that she used her mentality on topics then\r\ncounted vital. She was didactic, she was morally irreproachable,\r\nshe was unassuming. That her editor's confident prediction of her\r\nfame has been discredited by time, that she is in reality hardly\r\nso much as a name to-day, is due partly to the oblivion that has\r\novertaken her subjects, but also, and even more justly, to the dead\r\nlevel of her excellence. She has no wit, no fancy, no imagination,\r\nno sprightliness of thought, no humor. Mary Astell and \"Sophia\" were\r\noccasionally roused to picturesque indignation. But not so with Mrs.\r\nCockburn. She is as cold, as orderly, as unstimulating as a formula.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Margaret Fell (1614-1702)]\r\n\r\nAmong dissenters there is less literary record. We find more among\r\nthe Quakers than elsewhere, yet even there not so much as might be\r\nexpected from the fact of their recognition of the equality of the\r\nsexes. It was stated in their creed: \"As we dare not encourage any\r\nministry but that which we believe to spring from the influence\r\nof the Holy Spirit, so neither dare we attempt to restrain this\r\nministry to persons of any condition in life, or to the male sex\r\nalone; but as male and female are one in Christ, we hold it proper\r\nthat such of the female sex as we believe to be endued with a right\r\nqualification for the ministry should exercise their gifts for the\r\ngeneral edification of the Church.\"[170] As a rule, however, the\r\nQuaker women were too busy on their preaching tours to have much\r\ntime for authorship. Margaret Fell is their chief representative\r\nwriter.[171] Her activities began before the Restoration. As the\r\nwife of Judge Fell of Swarthmore Hall she was of distinct social\r\nimportance, and she showed unusual ability in the conduct of the\r\nhousehold affairs incident on her husband's wealth and large landed\r\nproperties. She was always exceedingly devout and Swarthmore Hall\r\nwas traditionally recognized as the home of \"lecturing ministers.\"\r\nAmong these itinerant speakers, in 1652, was George Fox. His brief\r\nsojourn at Swarthmore was epoch-making, for when Judge Fell returned\r\nfrom a distant visit he was met as he crossed Ulverston Sands by a\r\nsolemn conclave of gentlemen on horseback whose purpose it was to\r\nannounce that his wife and most of his household had become Quakers.\r\nOn investigation he became himself at least sufficiently sympathetic\r\nwith the new views not to interfere with his wife's convictions.\r\nFor half a century she was identified with Quaker interests. The\r\ngreat dining-room at Swarthmore was for many years the regular\r\nmeeting-place of the Friends. In 1669, eleven years after the death\r\nof Judge Fell, Margaret married George Fox, and till his death in\r\n1691 she gave her time, her thought, her money, to a defense of\r\npersecuted Quakers. Three of her daughters became preachers. She\r\ntraveled from jail to jail, from house to house, to comfort the\r\nimprisoned and their families, and from meeting to meeting to preach\r\nthe word. As the \"nursing mother\" of the church she had an immense\r\ncorrespondence. The petitions to the king and to powerful noblemen\r\nwere often composed and personally presented by her. The importance\r\nattached to her advice and opinions is indicated by the hundreds of\r\nletters still extant addressed to her by the preachers who gathered\r\nabout George Fox. During her most active years the practical conduct\r\nof church affairs occupied her to the exclusion of other work. But\r\nearlier, especially during 1665-1668, she made use of the enforced\r\nleisure consequent on various imprisonments to write in defense of\r\nQuaker principles. Of the ten tracts thus produced one of the most\r\ninteresting was on the vexed question of the right of women to preach\r\nand was entitled _Women's Speaking Justified, Proved and Allowed of\r\nby the Scriptures_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne Finch, Lady Conway (d. 1679)]\r\n\r\nAnother important lady who, after long study in other religions came\r\nfinally into the Quaker faith, was Anne Finch, a daughter of Sir\r\nHenry Finch. In 1651 she married Lord Conway and was established\r\nas mistress of Ragley Castle in Warwickshire. As a young woman she\r\nhad been attracted by the teachings of Henry More, the Cambridge\r\nPlatonist. After she became Lady Conway he spent much time at Ragley\r\nwhere he wrote several of his books. During his various absences Mr.\r\nMore and Lady Conway corresponded regularly on theological subjects.\r\nThe questions in her letters sufficiently indicate the metaphysical\r\nperplexities that absorbed her thoughts. She knew the learned tongues\r\nand read eagerly the works of \"Plato, Plotinus, Philo Judæus, and the\r\nKabbala Denudata.\" She was a theosophist and a mystic. The esoteric,\r\nthe mysterious, the miraculous, captured her imagination. \"Under\r\nher inspiration Ragley became the home of religious marvels.\" One\r\nchapter of _John Inglesant_, the novel in which Mr. Shorthouse so\r\nsympathetically described Little Gidding, is said to be based on\r\nthe life at Ragley. Lady Conway suffered from headaches so severe\r\nand persistent as to defy the best skill of London and Paris. Under\r\nthe influence of Mr. More, who said there might be \"a sanative and\r\nhealing contagion as well as a morbid and venemous,\" she summoned to\r\nRagley the famous Valentine Greatrakes, \"the Stroker,\" but the magic\r\nof his hands failed in her case. Her headaches made of her life one\r\nlong disease, but never conquered her intellectual eagerness and\r\nhardly abated her learned pursuits.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally joined the Quakers it was against the advice of\r\nMr. More, but she was one, he said, \"who never submitted all her\r\njudgment to any one.\" Her friendship with Robert Barclay and William\r\nPenn followed her acceptance of the new doctrines. While Lady Conway\r\nwas undoubtedly one of the most distinguished converts to the Quaker\r\nfaith, her invalidism and then her death in 1679 interfered with any\r\nsuch active service as that of Margaret Fell. The two women were,\r\nmoreover, temperamentally unlike. Margaret Fell, a descendant of\r\nAnne Askew, had the blood of the martyrs in her veins. A \"cause\"\r\ncould capture her mind and heart. She was energetic, an organizer\r\nand administrator. Lady Conway, on the other hand, beyond almost any\r\nwoman of her time, lived in things of the mind.\r\n\r\nOf Lady Conway's numerous works only one has been printed. In 1690\r\nthere appeared at Amsterdam a collection of philosophical treatises\r\nwritten in Latin. The first one of the series was a translation of\r\n\"a work by a certain English countess, learned beyond her sex.\"\r\nLeibnitz, on the authority of Van Helmont, attributed this to Lady\r\nConway. This treatise was re-translated into English in 1692.[172]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jane Ward, Mrs. Lead (1623-1704)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Jane Lead[173] was a mystic and the founder of a sect. She\r\nwas the daughter of Schildknap Ward, of a good Norfolk family, and\r\nit is said that there were no external influences to account for\r\nher unusual experiences. As a child in the midst of the Christmas\r\ngayeties at her father's house, she heard a miraculous voice that\r\nsummoned her to a religious life. She became a widow while still\r\nyoung and thereafter followed without hindrance, in the completest\r\nseclusion, in London, her recognized vocation. She studied mystical\r\nworks and had nightly prophetic visions which she recorded in her\r\nspiritual diary. Between 1681 and 1702 she published fifteen volumes\r\nand another one appeared immediately after her death. In 1693 Mr.\r\nFrancis Lee, a young Oxford man and a medical student at Leyden,\r\nvisited her, gave allegiance to her doctrines, and devoted himself to\r\nher service. Mr. Lee and Mrs. Lead became the center of an important\r\ntheosophical organization called _The Philadelphian Society_, which\r\nexisted till 1702. Mrs. Lead died in 1704 \"in the 81st year of\r\nher age and the 65th of her vocation to the inward life.\" Mr. Lee\r\nwrote to the Countess Kniphausen and others in France and Germany\r\na letter entitled _The Last Hours of Jane Lead by an Eye and Ear\r\nWitness_. Five years before her death Mrs. Lead's spiritual diary was\r\npublished under the title, _A Fountain of Gardens, watered by the\r\nRivers of Divine pleasure, and springing up in all the variety of\r\nspiritual plants, blown up by the pure Breath into Paradise. To which\r\nis prefixed, A Poem, introductory to the Philadelphia Age, called\r\nSolomon's Porch, or The Beautiful gate to Wisdom's Temple_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Susannah Annesley, Mrs. Wesley (1670-1742)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable women of the early eighteenth century was\r\nSusannah Wesley, the mother of John and Charles Wesley. She came of a\r\nfine old Nottinghamshire family, and her father, Dr. Annesley, a man\r\nof power and influence, \"the St. Paul of the Nonconformists,\" secured\r\nfor his children an education suitable to their birth. At twenty-one\r\nSusannah, a beautiful and gifted young woman, married Samuel Wesley\r\nand entered upon her career as wife of a rector of humble position\r\nand small means.\r\n\r\nIt is said that large families either submerge the individual, or\r\nresult in characters of exceptionally fine discipline. From this test\r\nSusannah emerged triumphant. She was the twenty-fifth child of her\r\nfather, and in the first twenty-one years of her married life she had\r\nnineteen children. So, as child and parent, she was always in close\r\ntouch with many varied personalities, an experience the conditions of\r\nwhich demanded both firmness and flexibility.\r\n\r\nHer married life seemed made up of difficulties. Most of it was\r\npassed in a remote rectory, at Epworth, in the Lincolnshire\r\nfens, among the crudest and most boorish people.[174] Not even\r\nthe strictest economy could hold the outgo within the meager\r\nlimits of the rector's stipend. There were fevers, small-pox, and\r\nother diseases to combat, and five of the children died young.\r\nThere were also disasters through fire and flood and through the\r\nhostility of malicious parishioners, but Mrs. Wesley held herself\r\nsteadfast to her ideals. Her spirit was never daunted. In the most\r\nunpromising environment, under the most adverse conditions, she\r\ncreated a family life remarkable for its order, serenity, good\r\nbreeding, and aspiration. Even as a child the quality of her mind\r\nand character had been apparent. It is reported that at thirteen,\r\nhaving heard at home much discussion of the points at issue between\r\nthe Nonconformists and the Church of England, she had reviewed\r\nthe questions for herself and had decided in favor of the Church.\r\nThroughout her married life she showed the same independence and\r\nself-reliance. Mr. and Mrs. Wesley were always very happy together,\r\nbut she was in no sense the ideal submissive wife of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. She wrote to her son John when he was in Oxford, \"'T is\r\na misfortune almost peculiar to our family that your father and I\r\nseldom think alike.\"[175] She considered King William a usurper and\r\nconsistently refused to say Amen to the rector's prayers for the new\r\nmonarch. Mr. Wesley celebrated the victory of Blenheim in a poem,\r\nbut Mrs. Wesley disapproved of the war and she wrote: \"Since I am\r\nnot satisfied of the lawfulness of the war, I cannot beg a blessing\r\non our arms till I can have the opinion of one wiser and a more\r\ncompetent judge than myself in this point; namely, whether a private\r\nperson that had no hand in the beginning of the war but did always\r\ndisapprove of it may, notwithstanding, implore God's blessing on it,\r\nand pray for the good success of those arms which were taken up, I\r\nthink unlawfully.\" And she declined to join in the worship on the day\r\nappointed for prayers for the success of English troops.[176]\r\n\r\nMrs. Wesley had a natural genius for teaching and she became the\r\nschool-mistress of her family. Her methods were uniform and rigorous.\r\nAt five each child was given in one day, during two sessions of three\r\nhours each, such effective tutoring in the alphabet that by night he\r\nknew it and could begin reading the Book of Genesis the next day.\r\nThe various studies counted necessary followed in due order. Each\r\nchild was kept closely to the task in hand and the progress made was\r\nsurprising. Mrs. Wesley said, \"It is almost incredible what a child\r\nmay be taught in a quarter of a year by a vigorous application if it\r\nhave but tolerable capacity and good health.\" The virtues inculcated\r\nwere prompt obedience, quiet manners, correct speech, and courtesy.\r\nThe religious training of the children received especial emphasis.\r\nMrs. Wesley wrote out for them a clear series of explanatory comments\r\non the Catechism and the Creed, she trained them to take part in\r\nfamily devotions, and once a week she met each child for an hour of\r\nprivate religious conversation and instruction. So precious were\r\nthese hours to the children that when John was a Fellow in Oxford,\r\nhe wrote urging his mother to devote her thought and prayer to him\r\nduring the Thursday evening hour that had been his.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wesley's devout ministrations to her own family, during her\r\nhusband's absence, became known to some of the neighbors who\r\ndesired to join her circle. The numbers increased so rapidly that\r\non the first Sunday of February, 1712, more than two hundred were\r\npresent and many went away for want of room. The curate objected to\r\nthese meetings and Mr. Wesley wrote in deprecation of them. Mrs.\r\nWesley, too, was seriously in doubt whether one of her sex could\r\nfind Scripture authority for thus breaking the bread of life to the\r\npeople. But the manifest needs of the poor parishioners and their\r\neagerness for the gospel prevailed over all doubts and the meetings\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThe power of Mrs. Wesley in her own home and immediate neighborhood\r\nwas, through her son John, felt throughout England. Mr. Winchester\r\nsays truly:\r\n\r\n  John Wesley was the son of his mother. From her he inherited his\r\n  logical cast of mind, his executive capacity, his inflexibility\r\n  of will, his union of independence of judgment with respect for\r\n  authority, his deep religious temper. And all the characteristics\r\n  were developed and fixed by his early training. His precision\r\n  and order, his gift of organization and mastery of details, his\r\n  notions of education, even some specific rules and customs of his\r\n  religious societies, can be traced to his mother's discipline. It\r\n  is often said that Methodism began in the University of Oxford:\r\n  with more truth it might be said that it began in Susannah\r\n  Wesley's nursery.[177]\r\n\r\nThe religious writers so far mentioned only partially represent the\r\ngreat amount of similar literary activity. In many homes where rank\r\nor wealth made social diversions an alluring possibility there was\r\ncarried on by wives and daughters not only a life of austere piety\r\nand great practical benevolence, but a life also of intellectual\r\nambitions and instincts. The fact that many of the questions which\r\nthese ladies discussed are now dead issues cannot obscure the more\r\nsignificant fact that on questions then counted vital they wrote\r\nalways with energy, often with logical acumen, and sometimes with\r\neffectiveness. The home and social life that emerges from scattered\r\nhints and records in these religious writings is as remote from\r\nthat portrayed in contemporary court memoirs or diaries as is the\r\ngeneral tone of _Paradise Lost_ or _Pilgrim's Progress_, and is worth\r\ndwelling upon as illustrative of that body of almost unrecognized\r\nsolid morality that gave to Jeremy Collier a background of public\r\napproval when he attacked the immorality of the stage, and through\r\nthe stage, the immorality of the stage-going people.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITERS ON PRACTICAL BENEFICENCE\r\n\r\nThe piety that finds genuine expression in the writings of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries had almost as frequent\r\nexpression in the practical necessities of daily life. On the great\r\nladies of the land was laid the responsibility for the physical\r\nwell-being, the education, and the happiness of those beneath them in\r\nbirth and wealth. Responsibilities now provided for by multifarious\r\noverworked organizations then devolved upon individuals. And many\r\nwomen in the distribution of their money and leisure showed so much\r\ninsight and practical ability as to become ruling influences in\r\ntheir communities. The fame of some of these women spread through\r\nthe nation. The combination which they showed of munificent giving,\r\non the one hand, and of rigid self-discipline, on the other, exalted\r\nthem almost into saints. The two ladies who most fully illustrate the\r\ntype are Mrs. Bovey and Lady Elizabeth Hastings. Their learning was\r\nchiefly in the realm of theology.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catherine Riches, Mrs. Bovey (1670-1726)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Bovey,[178] the daughter of a London merchant, was a great\r\nheiress and a great beauty and was consequently much sought after.\r\nAt fifteen she married William Bovey, Esq., Lord of the Manor of\r\nFlaxley, Gloucestershire. After seven years of unhappiness she was\r\nleft a childless widow with a large fortune at her command. She\r\nrefused to marry again, but entered into a close friendship with Mrs.\r\nMary Pope. The two ladies lived together in retirement for thirty-two\r\nyears, making it the purpose of their lives to manage Mrs. Bovey's\r\nfortune and estate and to dispose of most of the income in wisely\r\nregulated charities. Mrs. Bovey was the subject of much praise from\r\nall kinds of people. Mrs. Manley gives the following vivid picture of\r\nher:\r\n\r\n  She is one of those lofty, black and lasting beauties that strike\r\n  with Reverence, and yet Delight; there is no Feature in her Face,\r\n  nor any thing in her Person, her Air and Manner, that could be\r\n  exchanged for any others, and she not prove a Loser: Then as to\r\n  her Mind and Conduct, her Judgment, her Sense, her Stedfastness,\r\n  her Reading, her Wit and Conversation, they are admirable; so\r\n  much above what is most lovely in the sex, shut but your Eyes,\r\n  (and allow for the Musick of her Voice) your Mind would be\r\n  charmed, as thinking yourself conversing with the most knowing,\r\n  most refined of ours; free from all Levity and Superficialness,\r\n  her Sense is sold [solid?] and perspicuous. Lovely Porcia is so\r\n  polite, so neat, so perfect an economist, that in taking in all\r\n  the greater Beauties of Life, she does not disdain to stoop to\r\n  the most inferiour; in short, she knows all that a Man can know,\r\n  without despising what, as a woman, she should not be ignorant of.\r\n\r\nIn 1714 Steele dedicated the second volume of his _Ladies' Library_\r\nto her. With his genius for giving delightful compliments, he says:\r\n\"Thus with the charms of your own sex, and knowledge not inferior to\r\nthe more learned of ours, a closet, a bower, or some scene of rural\r\nnature, has constantly robbed the world of a ladies appearance, who\r\nnever was beheld but with gladness to her visitants, nor ever admired\r\nbut with pain to herself.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hickes, in the Preface to his _Linguarum Septentrionalium\r\nThesaurus_ (1702), eulogized this _præstantissima & honestissima\r\nmatrona_ as the _Angliæ nostræ Hypatia Christiana_. She had received\r\nno formal education, yet by frequent converse with some of the most\r\nlearned men of the day and by intense application to study she\r\ngained a great share of knowledge. She was interested in educational\r\nmatters, and she gave with particular pleasure to organizations for\r\nthe training of poor children. At her death Mrs. Pope, her executor,\r\nwas instructed to pay large sums to such charitable schemes as\r\nthe gray-coat school, the blue-coat school, the charity school of\r\nChrist's Church Parish in Southwark, and a college to be founded in\r\nthe Island of Bermuda.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bovey's attractive personality may be further emphasized by the\r\npersistence of the rumor identifying her with \"the perverse widow\"\r\nwhose charms and whose coldness destroyed the peace of Sir Roger de\r\nCoverley's heart. Her beauty, her wealth, her learning, her kindness\r\nof heart, her general beneficence, and, finally, her inaccessibility,\r\nmade her admired, loved, and longed for, till she was idealized into\r\nsomething quite above human nature's daily food.\r\n\r\nCatherine Riches's father belonged to the wealthy merchant class\r\nof London. It would be interesting if we could know the kind of\r\nhome life and training given to this young city heiress. Was it the\r\nunhappy disciplinary years of her married life that turned her so\r\ndecisively from the pomps and pleasures apparently awaiting one so\r\nyoung and beautiful and rich?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lady Elizabeth Hastings (1688-1739)]\r\n\r\nLady Elizabeth Hastings was the daughter of Theophilus, seventh\r\nearl of Huntingdon, by his first wife, through whom, in 1704,\r\nshe came into a fortune and the possession of Ledstone Park, an\r\nestate near Pontefract, Yorkshire. From twenty-two to her death at\r\nfifty-seven Lady Elizabeth lived almost continuously at Ledstone. Of\r\nthese thirty-five years not a striking event is recorded. Her days\r\nwere \"bound each to each by natural piety\" and her tranquil life\r\ndeveloped along an uninterrupted course of charity and devotion.\r\n\r\nTo live in Yorkshire, in the eighteenth century, was to be buried.\r\nSocial and intellectual life were alike without sustenance. Yet\r\nfrom this remote home Lady Elizabeth's fame traveled to London and\r\nshe became the subject of remarkable eulogies. Number 42 of _The\r\nTatler_, written possibly by Congreve, appeared in 1709 when the\r\n\"divine Aspasia\" had been but five years at Ledstone. She must have\r\ngone there with well-formed ideas of life, for with no vacillations,\r\nno period of experimentation, she seems to have entered immediately\r\non that career of religious contemplation and good works which\r\nhad, in five years, given her the reputation of being a \"female\r\nphilosopher\" of the most exalted type. _The Tatler_ paper says that\r\nshe put into practice the schemes and plans the ancient sages had\r\nthought beautiful but inimitable. Steele, in _The Tatler_, number 49,\r\ngave perfect expression to the reverent admiration with which Lady\r\nElizabeth had come to be regarded:\r\n\r\n  Aspasia must therefore be allowed to be the first of the\r\n  beauteous Order of Love, whose unaffected freedom, and conscious\r\n  innocence, give her the attendance of the graces in all her\r\n  actions. The awful distance which we bear towards her in all our\r\n  thoughts of her, are certain instances of her being the truest\r\n  object of love of any of her sex. In this accomplished lady, love\r\n  is the constant effect, because it is never the design. Yet,\r\n  though her mien carries much more invitation than command, to\r\n  behold her is an immediate check to loose behaviour; and to love\r\n  her is a liberal education.\r\n\r\nA somewhat closer view of the life of the Lady Elizabeth comes from\r\ncasual notes by Thoresby who, in his travels about the northern\r\ncounties between 1711 and 1724, frequently spent a few days at\r\nLedstone. From the unconnected details scattered through his letters\r\nand diaries there emerges a fairly clear picture of a great house\r\nexactly ordered on the basis of the religious life. Private prayers,\r\nfamily devotions in which all the servants were included, at several\r\nstated hours each day, preparation for church festivals, frequent\r\nassemblages for the reading of sermons and holy books, refreshing\r\nconferences on mooted points of doctrine, friendly communion on the\r\npresent and future joys of the Christian, filled the days to the\r\nexclusion of worldly interests. No mother superior could have felt a\r\nresponsibility more definite or have exerted a power more minutely\r\norganized for the promotion of the spiritual welfare of those under\r\nher charge.\r\n\r\nLady Hastings was also engaged in schemes of wider application. She\r\nbecame as noted for her benefactions as for the saintliness of her\r\nrecluse life. \"Human learning as the handmaid of religion\" was the\r\nbasis on which her gifts were made. She therefore became definitely\r\nassociated with the new schemes springing up in England for the\r\neducation of poor boys and girls. In one of Thoresby's visits they\r\nwalked across the fields to see the new school she was building and\r\nendowing for the absolute maintenance and education of fourteen poor\r\ngirls. The _Victoria History of the County of Yorkshire_ records\r\n\"Lady Hastings's Schools\" at Thorp Arch, Ledsham, Collingham, and\r\nWick. The formal deeds conveying these schools to trustees are\r\ndated in 1738, probably because at that time she knew she could not\r\nrecover from the cancerous affection of which she died the following\r\nyear. But some of these schools had been established and supported\r\nby her much earlier. The account given of the Ledsham school is\r\ntypical of the others: \"These schools are part of the general charity\r\nfounded by Lady Elizabeth Hastings by deed 14 December, 1738. In\r\na charity school for boys 20 scholars were to be taught and one\r\nyouth between the ages of 17 and 23 as a charity school-master. The\r\ngirls' school was for 20 scholars, who were to be clothed partly out\r\nof the proceeds of their spinning. The boys' school is now public\r\nand elementary, while the girls' school gives a free education in\r\nelementary subjects and household duties. The expenses of this\r\nschool amount to about £400 a year, and this is wholly derived from\r\nthe endowment.\" Lady Elizabeth also left a large bequest to Queen's\r\nCollege, Oxford, for poor scholars from schools in Yorkshire,\r\nWestmoreland, and Cumberland.[179] Berkeley's missionary project\r\nfound in her one of its most generous supporters, and her name headed\r\nmany a list of charities for educational and religious purposes.\r\n\r\nSo well known did she become that in 1735 a remarkable tribute to\r\nher was planned and partly executed. An anonymous donor offered to\r\n_The Gentleman's Magazine_ a series of prizes for the four best poems\r\nentitled _The Christian Hero_. The chief prize was to be a \"GOLD\r\nMEDAL (_intrinsic value about Ten Pounds) which shall have the_ HEAD\r\n_of the Rt. Hon. the Lady_ ELIZABETH HASTINGS _on one Side, and that\r\nof James Oglethorpe Esq. on the other, with this Motto_, ENGLAND MAY\r\nCHALLENGE THE WORLD, 1736.\"[180] This announcement was in December,\r\n1735. In the January number for 1736 the editor expressed his great\r\nconcern at having given offense to a Lady, whose name even they did\r\nnot venture to mention again, by the publication of the proposed Gold\r\nMedal prize without her consent.[181] In February the donor humbly\r\nasked her Ladyship's pardon for the uneasiness he had so undesignedly\r\ncaused her, saying that he had not the honor to know her personally,\r\nbut had been animated solely by the feeling of respect and deference\r\ndue to the eminence of her character.[182]\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Hastings died, in 1739, _The Gentleman's Magazine_\r\npublished a memorial notice said to be by Dr. Johnson. In heavy,\r\nanalytic fashion it sums up her reputation for sanctity and\r\nbenevolence, and closes with the statement that \"scarce any age\r\nhas afforded a greater Blessing to many, or a brighter Pattern to\r\nall.\"[183] The year after her death, Law, the noted author of _The\r\nSerious Call_, cited Lady Hastings as a sufficient refutation of the\r\ncharge that saintliness was not a natural product of the English\r\nChurch. In 1741 Wilford's stately folio contained a laudatory account\r\nof Lady Hastings, and in 1742 Mr. Barnard published _An Historical\r\nCharacter, relating to the holy and exemplary Life of the Right\r\nHonourable Lady Elizabeth Hastings. To which are added, 1. One of the\r\nCodicils of her last Will, setting forth her Devise of Lands to the\r\nProvost and Scholars of Queen's College in Oxford, for the interest\r\nof 18 Northern Schools. 2. Some Observations therefrom. 3. A Schedule\r\nof her other perpetual Charities, with the Principal Rules for their\r\nAdministration._\r\n\r\nFew of the people who praised Lady Hastings knew her personally.\r\nEven more strongly than in the case of Mrs. Bovey there seems to\r\nhave grown up in the public mind a kind of idealized picture of her.\r\nShe was a saint set apart from the world, not only by a voluntary\r\nisolation, but by virtue of her beauty, beneficence, and nobility.\r\nShe was enshrined. The reverence, affection, and praise accorded her\r\nhave a definite note of Platonism. She becomes an embodiment of the\r\nhighest charm and excellence, and the actual \"Lady Betty\" seems lost\r\nin the process.\r\n\r\nWhat were the diversions at Ledstone? Lady Elizabeth's four younger\r\nhalf-sisters, Anne, Frances, Catherine, and Margaret, usually lived\r\nwith her. After the death of Lady Elizabeth, Margaret, who had\r\nbecome a convert to Methodism, married one of the leaders in that\r\nnew communion and it was through her influence that Selina, the\r\nwife of Theophilus, the brother of these young ladies, was likewise\r\nconverted to Methodism. The five sisters were apparently a unit in\r\ntheir predisposition to a religious life. But they were too young and\r\ntoo free not to have had some other elements in their life. Had they\r\nany such relief as the book-binding at Little Gidding? Our knowledge\r\nof the life at Ledstone is tantalizingly incomplete because every\r\none who wrote about Lady Elizabeth took at once an exalted tone, and\r\ngeneralized his picture into abstractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lady Huntingdon (1707-91)]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with Lady Hastings and the life at Ledstone is\r\nanother leader in the religious world, the famous Lady Huntingdon,\r\nthe wife of Lady Hastings's brother Theophilus. Margaret Hastings had\r\naccepted the doctrines of the Methodists and through her influence\r\nLady Huntingdon allied herself with the same obscure body. Lady\r\nHuntingdon was from childhood introspective and religious. As the\r\ndaughter of Earl Ferrars and the wife of the Earl of Huntingdon, a\r\nbrilliant social career was almost inevitable. But in the midst of\r\nthe splendid scenes in which she took a vivacious and apparently\r\nhappy part she was spiritually aloof. She was always resisting the\r\nencroachments of the world, and striving by self-denial, a rigid\r\ncourse of devotional exercises, and systematic beneficences, to\r\nsecure inward peace. But she never came into a free and joyous\r\nreligious consciousness till she accepted the new doctrines taught\r\nby the group of Oxford men known as Methodists.[184] In 1739 she\r\nsent for John and Charles Wesley to visit her and she became a\r\nfearless advocate of their views. After her husband's death in 1746\r\nshe devoted her time, her great wealth, and her influence to the\r\ncause of Methodism. With several clergymen, her two daughters, her\r\nsisters, Anne and Frances, and a few friends, she made a sort of\r\nhome missionary tour from Bath through Wales for the purpose of\r\nstudying the needs of the poor in the matter of religious education.\r\nIn 1748-49 she opened her fine mansion in Park Street, London, for\r\nMethodist preaching services. The most distinguished men and women\r\nof the time attended these services, but not always as reverent\r\nlisteners. The whole scheme was met with varying degrees of ridicule.\r\nCoventry wrote a description of the meetings at Park Lane, it is\r\nsupposed, in his account of \"Lady Harridan\" and her assembly:\r\n\r\n  It was a sisterhood of the godly, met together to bewail the\r\n  vanities of human life, and congratulate one another on their\r\n  breaking from the enchantments of a sinful world.\r\n\r\n  The causes which had converted them to Methodism, were as various\r\n  as the characters of the converts. Some, the ill success of their\r\n  charms had driven to despair; others, a consciousness of too\r\n  great success had touched with repentance.... But the greater\r\n  part, like the noble president, were women fatigued and worn out\r\n  in the vanities of life, the superannuated jades of pleasure,\r\n  who, being grown sick of themselves, and weary of the world,\r\n  were now fled to Methodism, as the newest sort of folly that had\r\n  lately been invented.[185]\r\n\r\nOne particularly offensive element in Methodism to people who set\r\nstore by birth and breeding was its leveling effect. Social position\r\ncounted for little in the face of the all-important classification\r\ninto saints and sinners. The Duchess of Buckingham wrote in violent\r\nprotest: \"The doctrines of these preachers are most repulsive, and\r\nstrongly tinctured with impertinence and disrespect towards their\r\nsuperiors, in perpetually endeavoring to level all ranks and do away\r\nwith all distinctions. It is monstrous to be told that you have a\r\nheart as sinful as the common wretches that crawl upon the earth.\r\nThis is highly offensive and insulting, and I cannot but wonder that\r\nyour ladyship should relish any sentiments so much at variance with\r\nhigh rank and good breeding.\"[186]\r\n\r\nThe fruition of Lady Huntingdon's remarkable work belongs later in\r\nthe century, but its inception is between 1739 and 1760 and is of\r\ngreat importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAMATIC WRITERS\r\n\r\nIn July, 1867, there was dispersed at Sotheby's rooms the library\r\nof the Reverend A. J. Stainforth. \"The collection was formed\r\nentirely of works of British and American poetesses and female\r\ndramatic writers. The books were arranged in over three thousand\r\nlots, and the catalogue extends to 166 pages.\" That Mr. Stainforth\r\nspared neither money nor diligence in securing the books for this\r\ncollection is evident from a single illustration, namely, his search\r\nfor so obscure a book as _Eliza's Babes_. \"When Mr. Stainforth was\r\nforming his collection of _Female Poets_ without regard to cost,\r\nhe failed to procure a copy of _Eliza's Babes_, although the hue\r\nand cry was circulated far and near.\"[187] I have not had access to\r\nthis catalogue and I do not know how many items the \"three thousand\r\nlots\" contain, nor how many individual names are catalogued. If the\r\narrangement is chronological it would doubtless serve to indicate the\r\nvery rapid spread of female authors after about 1750. Yet even the\r\ncentury from 1650 to 1750 is not without its large contribution. In\r\nthe preceding sections of this study there has been some indication\r\nof the mass of devotional and polemical writing by women. Among\r\npoets, playwrights, essayists, novelists, and letter-writers we shall\r\nfind not only an even greater volume of production, but work of\r\nhigher intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duchess of Newcastle (cir. 1625-1673)]\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Newcastle wrote numerous plays. Twenty-one were\r\npublished in 1662, and in 1668 five more appeared. They are\r\ndescribed as hardly more than allegorical dialogues arranged in\r\nsuccessive scenes, but without plot, and showing no power of dramatic\r\nportrayal. The Duchess herself is evidently the original of several\r\nof the characters. In her plays as in her scientific studies the\r\nparticular boast of the Duchess is that whatever she writes is spun\r\nout of her own fancy:\r\n\r\n      But noble readers, do not think my plays\r\n      Are such as have been writ in former days;\r\n      As Johnson, Shakespear, Beaumont, Fletcher writ,\r\n      Mine want their learning, reading, language, wit.\r\n      The Latin phrases, I could never tell,\r\n      But Johnson could, which made him write so well.\r\n      Greek, Latin poets I could never read,\r\n      Not their historians, but our English Speed:\r\n      I could not steal their wit, nor plots out-take;\r\n      All my plays plots, my own poor brain did make.\r\n      From Plutarch's story, I ne'er took a plot,\r\n      Nor from romances, nor from Don Quixote.[188]\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that these plays were not suited for stage\r\npresentation, and, in point of fact, very few of them were ever put\r\ninto rehearsal. One of the plays that did appear drew a great crowd,\r\nbut the motive was curiosity to see the Duchess rather than any\r\ninterest in the play. Pepys, who went to hear this play March 30,\r\n1667, wrote concerning it, and its author:\r\n\r\n  The whole story of this lady is a romance and all she does is\r\n  romantic. Her footmen in velvet coats, and herself in antique\r\n  dress, as they say; and was the other day at her own play, \"The\r\n  Humorous Lovers\"; the most ridiculous thing that ever was wrote,\r\n  but she and her Lord mightily pleased with it: and she at the\r\n  end, made her respects to the players, and did give them thanks.\r\n  There is as much expectation of her coming to Court, that so\r\n  people may come to see her, as if it were the Queen of Sheba.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aphra Amis, Mrs. Behn (1640-1689)]\r\n\r\nThe only important dramatic work by a woman during the second half\r\nof the seventeenth century was by Mrs. Behn. She was born at Wye,\r\nin Kent.[189] While she was still very young the Amis family went\r\nto Surinam, West Indies, where Aphra's girlhood was spent. At about\r\ntwenty-three[190] she returned to England and soon thereafter married\r\nMr. Behn, a London merchant of Dutch parentage. At his death, before\r\n1666, she was left nearly penniless. For a short time she was in\r\nHolland as a secret political agent for the English court. But her\r\nservices received scant official recognition and the pay was so\r\nmeager and uncertain that she returned to England and began to look\r\nabout for other means of support. The new passion for the theater was\r\nnot yet exhausted and she turned instinctively to play-writing as\r\nher most hopeful resource. During the years 1670-1689 her literary\r\noutput extended into many other fields and shows continuous work at\r\nhigh pressure. Not only was she one of the chief assets of the Duke's\r\nTheater as a playwright, but she also translated French verse and\r\nprose; she wrote numerous occasional poems; she edited miscellanies;\r\nand she wrote novels. Her comedies had a most flattering contemporary\r\nvogue and some of them maintained their popularity well into the\r\nnext century. She satisfied the taste of the day for rapid, bustling\r\nplots, with many and varied characters, and her intrigues were\r\ncleverly manipulated, while she surpassed most of her contemporaries\r\nin vivacious, easy, rapid dialogue. She is never dull or insipid. Her\r\nplays show that she had a vigorous mind, an overflow of spirits, a\r\nreckless mental energy. There is apparent a sense of power conscious\r\nof itself and careless of precedents or restrictions. In defiance of\r\nBen Jonson, Dryden, and Shadwell she spoke contemptuously of \"the\r\nmusty unities.\" The material for her plays she took wherever she\r\nfound it, from preceding plays, from romances, from real life, used\r\nit, made it over, and often so improved it that she could justifiably\r\nlaugh at charges of plagiarism. One charge she could not evade\r\nand that had to do with the immorality of her writings. Dryden,\r\nShadwell, Wycherley, and Etherege, and the audiences who applauded\r\ntheir plays, seemed to find the _vis comica_ in an open indecency\r\nof character, situation, and conversation that is to-day almost\r\nunbelievable. And of Mrs. Behn it must be admitted that she vied with\r\nthe most corrupt. She said, in extenuation, as Dryden also said in\r\nanswer to Jeremy Collier's strictures, that she wrote to please. She\r\ndid not consider comedy \"a reforming or converting agent,\" it was\r\nmeant to be \"an entertainment.\" Her emphasis on the vicious elements\r\nof the life about her was a clear case of supply and demand, but it\r\nhad an unhappy personal result. There early gathered about her name\r\na hostile tradition based on the fact that she was not only a woman\r\nwriter, but an eminently successful woman writer, and on the further\r\nfact that, being a woman, she had not the modest reserve for which\r\nthe chaste Orinda was idolized, but presented debaucheries in the\r\nbold and open manner characteristic of contemporary male playwrights.\r\nThis hostile tradition, crystallized by Pope in a witty couplet,[191]\r\nbecame a commonplace of adverse criticism, and Astræa's undeniable\r\ntalents have sunk into oblivion. A general revival of Mrs. Behn's\r\ncomedies would be impossible, undesirable, but by the student of\r\nsocial and political history in the Restoration period they cannot be\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. APHRA BEHN\r\n\r\nFrom a picture by Mary Beale in the collection of his Grace the Duke\r\nof Buckingham. Drawn by T. Uwins. Engraved by J. Fittler, A.R.A. From\r\nan engraving in _Effigies Poeticae_, London, 1824, Vol. II]\r\n\r\nMrs. Behn's novels are now as little known as her plays, but in her\r\nown day were very popular. _Oroonoko_, the first and by far the\r\nbest, was based on her life in Surinam. At a time when French heroic\r\nromances, with their high-flown adventures, unreal characters, and\r\nstilted dialogue, were the only works of fiction, Mrs. Behn's short,\r\nsimple, vigorous, and affecting story of real life comes with a\r\nstartling sense of novelty.[192] The vivid portrayal of the cruelties\r\nincident to the slave trade, though probably written without didactic\r\nintent, gives the story a modern humanitarian note not unprophetic of\r\n_Uncle Tom's Cabin_. And the description of the Indian Prince as\r\nthe ideal natural man, his innate virtues in their pristine purity\r\nunvitiated by civilization, foreshadows the theories of Rousseau.\r\nThe descriptions of nature, however exaggerated, are vivid and\r\nattractive, and show a delight in scenic detail not found again in\r\nfiction before Mrs. Collyer in 1730. Thus in four ways, choice of\r\nreal life as a theme, interest in scenery, emphasis on the natural\r\nman, and on humanitarianism, Mrs. Behn's little story links itself\r\nwith the novel of the future rather than with the romances of the\r\npast. In the plays Mrs. Behn showed exceptional ability in a realm in\r\nwhich women have seldom excelled. In her novels she marked out a path\r\nwhere women have gained marked literary success.\r\n\r\nIn one other way she is an important, outstanding figure. She was\r\nthe first woman in England who made authorship a profession, the\r\nfirst one who definitely set out to earn her living by her pen. It\r\nis unfortunate that the first literary lady to achieve \"economic\r\nindependence\" should likewise be the first whose writings were\r\nnotably immoral. But it is a law of human nature that an unaccustomed\r\nfreedom seldom contents itself in its early exercise of power with\r\ndestroying merely the unjust bonds by which it has been confined.\r\nFreedom is likely to begin by being license. And when Aphra Behn\r\nso far defied convention as to compete with men as a playwright on\r\nthe public stage, when she openly criticized her contemporaries and\r\nboasted that her comedies did not fall below most that she read, she\r\nhad so set herself apart in an unfeminine realm that prudishness and\r\ndecency fell together. Psychologically the actress and the writer of\r\ncomedies seem to have gone through similar experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plays between 1696 and 1706]\r\n\r\nMrs. Behn had no feminine contemporary rivals, but later in the\r\ncentury a number of women attempted to write for the stage. In\r\nGenest's record for Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields seven plays\r\nby six women are listed in 1696. In the ensuing ten years at least\r\neighteen more plays by women appeared. This exceptional activity\r\ndid not pass without satiric comment. In 1697 \"W. M.'s\" _Female\r\nWits_,[193] with its attack on Miss Trotter, Mrs. Manley, and\r\nMrs. Pix, was acted six times without intermission, a run showing\r\nexceptional popularity. In 1702 the hostility of the wits towards\r\nwomen playwrights was again voiced in Gildon's _The Two Stages_.[194]\r\nGenest says that about this time \"prejudice against females rose\r\nso high that Mrs. Centlivre in _Stolen Heiress_ and Mrs. Pix in\r\n_Conquest of Spain_ spoke of their plays as if by men.\"[195] The\r\nauthors of these twenty-five plays were Miss Trotter, Mrs. Pix, Mrs.\r\nManley, Mrs. Centlivre, Mrs. Wiseman, \"A Lady,\" \"A Young Lady,\" \"A\r\nLady of Quality,\" and \"A Club of Ladies.\" Fourteen of the plays\r\nwere tragedies, the best one being, probably, Miss Trotter's _Fatal\r\nFriendship_, almost the only one of the fourteen that survived on\r\nthe stage after its initial season. The writers of comedy were more\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nFew of these authors need particular notice. Miss Trotter's work\r\nhas already been discussed.[196] Mrs. Manley's three plays appeared\r\nat ten-year intervals, 1696, 1706, 1717. They were unsuccessful on\r\nthe stage and they have no qualities that would claim the reader's\r\nattention. It is in fiction, not in drama, that Mrs. Manley gained\r\nher reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Pix (1666-1720?)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Pix, daughter of the Reverend Roger Griffith, Vicar of\r\nNettlested in Oxfordshire, and wife of George Pix, a merchant tailor\r\nof London, was thirty when she brought out her first play. During\r\nthe ensuing ten years she put on the stage five tragedies, one\r\ncomedy, and possibly other plays not under her name. Her tragedies,\r\nthough written in blank verse, yet belong to the heroic _genre_,\r\nand their chief interest lies in the fact that they represent that\r\n_genre_ in its dying throes. In Mrs. Pix's tragedies the heroic\r\nplay of Dryden's day could look upon its enfeebled and distorted\r\nimage. We have the war background, the remoteness of time and place,\r\nthe historical source with free alterations of persons and events,\r\nthat mark the heroic drama. The type characters are the same. The\r\nheroine is unapproachable in beauty, unassailable in virtue. The\r\nhero, godlike in personal prowess, the idol of the army, framed by\r\nnature to be the darling joy of womankind, cares for glory only that\r\nhe may lay it at the feet of his beloved. Blest by her he will leave\r\nunenvied monarchs to \"fight for this Dunghil Earth.\" This noble pair,\r\njoined by indissoluble vows or by a secret marriage, are subjected\r\nby the plot to the machinations of the beautiful wicked woman in\r\nwhose heart has sprung into being a passion for the hero, and to the\r\narrogant demands of the tyrant who claims the heroine as his prey.\r\nThe result is disaster and the last act is a holocaust. Fights,\r\nmurders, and suicides carry off all the important _dramatis personæ_.\r\nDisguises, mistaken identity, the ravings of sudden madness, ghosts,\r\nand secret documents, determine the events of the play. Passion is\r\ntorn into exclamatory tatters from the first scene to the last. We\r\nhave rant and bluster and tortured similes, until taste, good sense,\r\nand correct English suffer the same fate as the chief characters.\r\nThe description of Mrs. Pix as \"a fat female author,\" appropriately\r\ncalled \"Mrs. Wellfed,\" would prepare us for something more placid\r\nthan the chaos into which she leads us.\r\n\r\nThe one possible explanation of Mrs. Pix's acceptance year after\r\nyear by the audiences of Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn Fields is that\r\nthe business of her plays never lags. They are short, full of action\r\nand surprising turns. An event is never delayed by a disquisition.\r\nThey also gave excellent opportunity for scenic effects of palaces,\r\nprisons, and camps.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Susanna Freeman, Mrs. Centlivre (1680?-1723)]\r\n\r\nThe only woman writer of plays of real importance in this period is\r\nSusanna Centlivre.[197] She was the daughter of a Mr. Freeman of\r\nHolbeach, Lincolnshire. He is said to have had a considerable estate\r\nat the time of the Restoration, but being a zealous dissenter, he was\r\npersecuted, his estates were confiscated, and he was obliged to seek\r\nrefuge in Ireland, where Susanna was born. Her early life is involved\r\nin obscurity, but there cling to her name biographical details of\r\na picturesque and romantic sort, though of rather questionable\r\nauthenticity. Left an orphan at nine and subjected to the ill-usage\r\nof a stepmother, the child, at twelve, finally escapes and makes her\r\nway to London which she enters penniless, innocent, beautiful. She\r\nis rescued by a Cambridge student, a Mr. Hammond, and disguised as\r\na boy she accompanies him to the University. Later she marries the\r\nnephew of Stephen Fox, but is left a widow before she is sixteen. A\r\nsecond marriage to a Mr. Carroll results in a second widowhood before\r\nshe is eighteen. At twenty her first tragedy is played at Drury Lane.\r\nShe appears soon after this as an actress in country theaters. Mrs.\r\nBehn and Mrs. Haywood could ask no richer material for an adventure\r\nnovel. Then suddenly the scene changes. The buffeted Susanna marries\r\nMr. Centlivre, Queen Anne's chief pastry-cook, and settles down into\r\na comfortable, orderly, and apparently happy domestic life, of which,\r\nhowever, we know in reality even less than of her early kaleidoscopic\r\ncareer.[198] The events of her life are the presentation and\r\npublication of her plays.\r\n\r\nBefore her marriage in 1706 she had begun the series of comedies of\r\nwhich, between 1703 and 1722, she wrote seventeen. They were all\r\nsuccessful, and four of them, _The Gamester_ (1705), _The Busy Body_\r\n(1709), _The Wonder: A Woman Keeps a Secret_ (1714), and _A Bold\r\nStroke for a Wife_ (1718), held a fairly prominent place on the stage\r\nthrough the century.\r\n\r\nIn 1761 there was published a fine edition of her works in three\r\nvolumes. There is a preliminary address \"To the World\" in which an\r\nanonymous woman endeavors to do justice to \"The Manes of the never\r\nto be forgotten Mrs. Centlivre.\" She thus recounts the difficulties\r\nMrs. Centlivre encountered as a female author:\r\n\r\n  She was even ashamed to proclaim her own great Genius, probably\r\n  because the Custom of the Times discountenanced poetical\r\n  Excellence in a Female. The Gentlemen of the Quill published it\r\n  not, perhaps envying her superior Talents; and her Bookseller,\r\n  complying with national Prejudices, put a fictitious Name to her\r\n  Love's Contrivance, thro' Fear that the Work shou'd be condemned\r\n  if known to be Feminine. With modest Diffidence she sent her\r\n  Performances, like Orphans, into the World, without so much as a\r\n  Nobleman to protect them; but they did not need to be supported\r\n  by Interest, they were admired as soon as known, their real\r\n  Standard, Merit, brought crowding Spectators to the playhouses,\r\n  and the female Author, tho' unknown, heard Applauses, such as\r\n  have since been heaped on that great Author and Actor _Colley\r\n  Cibber_.\r\n\r\n  Her play of the Busy Body, when known to be the Work of a Woman\r\n  scarce defray'd the Expences of the First Night. The thin\r\n  audience were pleased, and caused a full House the Second; the\r\n  Third was crowded, and so on to the Thirteenth, when it was\r\n  stopt, on account of the advanced Season; but the following\r\n  Winter it appear'd again with Applause, and for Six Nights\r\n  successively, was acted by rival Players, both at _Drury\r\n  Lane_ and at the _Hay-Market_ Houses. See here the Effects of\r\n  Prejudice, a Woman who did Honour to the Nation, suffer'd because\r\n  she was a Woman. Are these things fit and becoming a free-born\r\n  People, who call themselves polite and civilized! Hold! let my\r\n  Pen stop, and not reproach the present Age for the Sins of their\r\n  Fathers....\r\n\r\n  A Poet is born so, not made by Rules; and is there not an equal\r\n  Chance that the Poetical Birth should be female as well as\r\n  male?... I could wish that some young Ladies of my Acquaintance,\r\n  now in Boarding Schools, had classical Education, which would\r\n  improve their Minds, furnish them with a more general Knowledge,\r\n  and of course better fit them for Conversation, and the\r\n  Management of Business.\r\n\r\nThe author of \"To the World\" finds great satisfaction in the union\r\nof Mrs. Lennox with \"Lord Corke and Mr. Samuel Johnson\" in the\r\ntranslation of _Brumoy's Greek Theatre_.\r\n\r\n  This convinces me [she says] that not only that barbarous Custom\r\n  of denying Women to have Souls, begins to be rejected as foolish\r\n  and absurd, but also that foolish Assertion, that Female Minds\r\n  are not capable of producing literary Works, equal even to those\r\n  of _Pope_, now loses Ground, and probably the next Age may be\r\n  taught by our pens that our Geniuses have been hitherto cramped\r\n  and smothered, but not extinguished, and that the Sovereignty\r\n  which the male Part of the Creation have, until now usurped over\r\n  us, is unreasonably arbitrary: And, further, that our natural\r\n  Abilities entitle us to a larger Share, not only in Literary\r\n  Decisions, but that, with the present Directors, we are equally\r\n  entitled to Power both in Church and State....\r\n\r\nIn 1764 Baker, in _Biographia Dramatica_, gave an account of Mrs.\r\nCentlivre's work, and most eighteenth-century dramatic collections\r\nincluded plays by her. In 1776 _The New English Theatre_, which\r\nprofessed to assemble \"the most Valuable Plays which have been Acted\r\non the London Stage,\" published _The Busy Body_, _A Bold Stroke for\r\na Wife_, and _The Wonder_. Her plays were included by John Bell\r\nin various collections from 1776 to 1792. Mrs. Inchbald, in her\r\n_British Theatre_ (1808), and Oxberry, in _The New English Drama_,\r\n1818-1824, carried the publication of her plays into the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Such brief notices as occur are highly laudatory. Mr. Baker\r\nsays: \"In a word we cannot help giving it as our opinion, that if\r\nwe do not allow her to be the very first of our female writers for\r\nthe stage, she has but one above her, and may justly be placed next\r\nto her predecessor in dramatic glory, the great Mrs. Behn.\" Nearly\r\nhalf a century later Mrs. Inchbald gave even stronger praise when\r\nshe said that Mrs. Centlivre \"ranks in the first class of our comic\r\ndramatists.\" Of the _Busy Body_ Mrs. Inchbald said: \"This comedy is\r\nby far her best work. In excellence of fable, strength of character,\r\nand intricacy of occurrences, it forms one of the most entertaining\r\nexhibitions the theatre can boast.\" Of _The Wonder_ she wrote:\r\n\"Garrick thought Don Felix worthy his most powerful exertions, in\r\ndescribing the passion of jealousy; and his character was upon the\r\nlists with the favorite parts he performed.... Mrs. Centlivre has\r\nsomewhere said 'the Muses, like most females, are least liberal\r\nto their own sex.' She was ungrateful if she did not acknowledge\r\nher obligation to them in the composition of this work; for they\r\npresided with no niggardly influence over the whole production.\"\r\n\r\nModern study of Mrs. Centlivre's work has taken a surprising turn. It\r\nhas to do entirely with _Quellen_ and _Verhältnisse_. In 1900-1905\r\nthere were seven German dissertations dealing with the sources of her\r\nplays.[199]\r\n\r\nThe impulse to play-writing seems to have expended itself with Mrs.\r\nCentlivre. Hannah Cowley's popular _Belle's Stratagem_ (1782) is\r\nthe only other play of even moderate importance through the rest of\r\nthe century. The situation with regard to play-writing is rather\r\ncurious. Virtuous ladies were at liberty to write tragedies because\r\ntragedies were supposed to be moral and elevating. But unfortunately\r\nnone of these ladies succeeded in tragedy. On the other hand, ladies\r\nwho were not virtuous wrote comedies and were eminently successful.\r\nThe realm between tragedy and comedy, the sentimental comedy, in its\r\ncombination of didacticism and morality with social studies from\r\nmiddle-class life and the opportunity for rapid intrigue, might have\r\nseemed the very medium in which women could most advantageously work.\r\nBut the successful sentimental comedies from _The Conscious Lovers_\r\nto _False Delicacy_ were written by men playwrights.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL LEARNING AND LITERARY WORK\r\n\r\nBesides the women whose work was sufficiently specialized to be\r\ngrouped under particular subjects or species there were many women\r\nto whom learning was itself an avocation with no thought of any\r\nliterary outcome, and there were many more whose interests were in\r\nthe general field of _belles-lettres_ and who wrote either in verse\r\nor in prose, and on such varied themes as the occasion might suggest.\r\nSince no effective principle of classification suggests itself in\r\nconnection with these writers, it will probably be in the interests\r\nof clearness to discuss them in an order as nearly chronological as\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joan Philips (fl. 1679)]\r\n\r\nAn early, almost unknown, little volume of poems, published in 1679\r\nunder the title, _Female Poems on Several Occasions. Written by\r\nEphelia_, is the work of Joan Philips whose portrait accompanies the\r\npoems. Such of Miss Philips's poems as can be dated belong but a year\r\nor two before the publication of the book. She apparently had some\r\nrather close connection with court circles. Her little volume is\r\ndedicated to the \"Most Excellent Princess Mary, Dutchess of Richmond\r\nand Lennox\"; she sends a congratulatory poem to Charles II on the\r\ndiscovery of the Popish Plot; and she writes an elegy on Archbishop\r\nSheldon.\r\n\r\nHer poems are not, however, usually concerned with court and state.\r\nThe \"Several Occasions\" calling forth her verse are chiefly amatory\r\nor friendly. Her love-poems are highly personal. From poem to poem\r\nthe lady pursues the uneven and finally disastrous course of her love\r\nfor \"Strephon,\" sometimes less poetically addressed as \"F. G.\" From\r\n\"Love's First Approach\" to Strephon's final decisive nuptials with\r\na wealthier Fair One the hopes and despairs of Ephelia are spread\r\nbefore us. She can find no surcease from sorrow. Books fail her as\r\na resource, and her pen proves as recalcitrant as that of the White\r\nKing in Looking Glass Land.\r\n\r\n      Sometimes with Books I would divert my mind,\r\n      But nothing there but F's and G's I find.\r\n      Sometimes to ease my Grief, my Pen I take\r\n      But it no letters but F. G. will make.\r\n\r\nMiss Philips's friendship poems, in their addresses to \"the honoured\r\nEugenia,\" \"the beauteous Marinda,\" to \"Damon,\" and to \"Phylocles\r\ninviting him to friendship\" show how definitely Ephelia formed\r\nherself on the model of the great Orinda whom she praises as having\r\nreached the summit of excellence.\r\n\r\nMiss Philips also wrote in awe-struck admiration of \"Madam _Behn_\"\r\nwhose \"strenuous polite lines\" seemed to her a union of \"Strong and\r\nSweet\" such as might be envied by the wittiest men. And she followed\r\nin the footsteps of Mrs. Behn to the extent of writing one comedy,\r\n_The Pair-Royal of Coxcombs_ which had the humble success of being\r\nacted at a dancing-school. The deprecatory Prologue and Epilogue were\r\nincluded in her poems together with some of the love-songs in the\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nEphelia seems to spread her life before us, but as a personage in\r\nthe real world she escapes us. She and Strephon have faded into\r\nobscurity. She is contemporary in comedy with Mrs. Behn. Had they\r\nsome literary comradeship? But twelve years separate the published\r\nwork of Joan Philips from that of Mrs. Katherine Philips. Were\r\nthe two poetesses perhaps related? Lady Winchilsea was eighteen\r\nwhen the volume by Ephelia appeared. About fifteen years later we\r\nfind Lady Winchilsea as \"Ardealia\" writing on Friendship to one\r\n\"Ephelia.\" Could it possibly be this Ephelia? Did Ephelia publish\r\nthe poems herself with her own portrait as frontispiece? If so she\r\nwas strangely lacking in the reserve characteristic of Orinda and\r\nArdelia. But even with no biographical data whereby to substantiate\r\nor correct the poems, the thin little volume holds its place of\r\ninterest because of its early date and because of the literary\r\nambitions it indicates.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne Killigrew (1660-1685)]\r\n\r\nAnne Killigrew came of a family prominent in the court of Charles\r\nII. Her uncle Thomas, the \"court wit,\" was given a patent for the\r\nTheater Royal; her uncle Henry was admiral under James, Duke of York;\r\nher father was chaplain to James and Master of the Savoy; and Anne\r\nwas maid of honor to Mary of Modena. She was born in St. Martin's\r\nLane and died at her father's lodgings within the Cloisters of\r\nWestminster. London and the court were her habitat. Ballard says she\r\nhad \"a polite education,\" but no details are given. She apparently\r\nwas taught the accomplishments counted necessary for a girl in her\r\nsocial position. That she went beyond mediocrity in painting we\r\nhave already seen.[200] In poetry, also, according to Dryden, she\r\nexcelled. The thin volume of her published verse (1686) scarcely\r\njustifies his eulogy, but Wood, in _Athenæ Oxoniensis_, says that\r\nDryden in no way exceeds the truth. Her poems sent anonymously from\r\nhand to hand received high praise and were even at first attributed\r\nto the best poets of the age. They gradually came to be known as\r\nhers, but she gives no evidence of having suffered any contumely\r\nas a poetess. She has nowhere any complaint of undue or irritating\r\nfeminine limitations. She is pessimistic, scornful, rather hard and\r\ndrastic, in her judgments, but it is greed for gold, ambition for\r\nplace or power, unbridled love, atheism, war, that are the subjects\r\nof her invective. There is not a light or playful, or even a happy,\r\ntouch in her poems. They have a crude virility, what Dryden calls a\r\n\"noble vigour,\" and a contemptuous outlook on \"the truly wretched\r\nHuman Race.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally Miss Killigrew must have been attractive. Her epitaph\r\neulogizes her as a daughter and a sister:\r\n\r\n      In a numerous race\r\n      And vertuous, the highest place\r\n      None envy'd her: sisters, brothers,\r\n      Her admirers were and lovers:\r\n      She was to all s' obliging sweet,\r\n      All in one love to her did meet.\r\n\r\nAnd she was an acknowledged favorite at court, especially with her\r\nroyal master and mistress. Dryden emphasizes her beauty and charm.\r\nThe portrait she painted of herself shows her in no sense averse to\r\npomps and vanities of attire.[201] In actual life she must have moved\r\nalong in fairly smooth accord with the life about her, but there\r\ncould have been few ladies within the circle of the court more alien\r\nto it in spirit than Anne Killigrew. It is difficult to place her\r\nmentally amid the gayeties of London life. She presents an anomaly.\r\nTo be young, beautiful, gifted, high in social opportunities,\r\npraised and loved, and yet to look out upon life with bitterness\r\nand distaste, to be conscious at twenty-five that all this world\r\nhas to offer will turn to dust and ashes in the mouth--such is the\r\ncurious combination we find in her. While the few accessible details\r\nconcerning her indicate a considerable degree of lovableness, her\r\npoems are those of an implacable moral censor.\r\n\r\nAnne Killigrew was but four when Mrs. Philips died, but the spell of\r\nthe \"Matchless Orinda\" descended early upon her, and she gives one of\r\nthe earliest of the many eulogies written by women concerning their\r\ndistinguished ancestor among British Muses.\r\n\r\n      Orinda (Albion, and her sex's grace)\r\n      Ow'd not her glory to a beauteous face:\r\n      It was her radiant soul that shone within,\r\n      Which struck a lustre thro' her outward skin;\r\n      That did her lips and cheeks with roses dye,\r\n      Advanc'd her height, and sparkled in her eye.\r\n      Nor did her sex at all obstruct her fame.\r\n      But high'r 'mongst the stars it fixt her name;\r\n      What she did write, not only all allow'd,\r\n      But ev'ry laurel, to her laurel bow'd!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Evelyn (1635-1709) and Mary Evelyn (1665-85)]\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn's flattering letter to the Duchess of Newcastle,\r\nalready quoted, with its list of learned women, his suggestion to\r\nLord Cornbury that he add two ladies to his gallery of notables,\r\nthe trouble he took to conduct a party of ladies to see the girls'\r\n\"colleges\" at Hackney, and various references in _Numismata_ (1697)\r\nindicate a genuine interest in the intellectual achievements of\r\nwomen. Mrs. Evelyn seems at first to have been of a different temper.\r\nShe wrote as follows to her son's tutor, Mr. Bohun, in 1672:\r\n\r\n  Women were not borne to reade authors, and censure the learned,\r\n  to compare lives and judge of virtues, to give rules of morality,\r\n  and sacrifice to the Muses. We are willing to acknowledge all\r\n  time borrowed from family duties misspent; the care of children's\r\n  education, observing a husband's commands, assisting the sick,\r\n  relieving the poore, and being serviceable to our friends, are of\r\n  sufficient weight to employ the most improved capacities amongst\r\n  us. If sometimes it happens by accident that one of a thousand\r\n  aspires a little higher, her fate commonly exposes her to wonder,\r\n  but adds little to esteeme. The distaffe will defend our quarrels\r\n  as well as the sword, and the needle is as instructive as the\r\n  penne. A heroine is a kind of prodigy: the influence of a blazing\r\n  starre is not more dangerous, or more avoyded. Though I have\r\n  lived under the roofe of the learned, and in the neighborhood of\r\n  science, it has had no other effect on a temper like mine, but\r\n  that of admiration.\r\n\r\nBut these very letters, in which Mrs. Evelyn disclaims learning,\r\nwould be a capital point in refutation of Macaulay's charge of\r\ngeneral feminine illiteracy. In subject-matter, in style, and in the\r\nmechanics of writing they show a development not unworthy of that\r\n\"roofe of the learned\" under which she dwelt. At the time Mrs. Evelyn\r\nwrote the letter just quoted her daughter Mary was but six years old,\r\nbut her literary and artistic tastes must have soon become manifest,\r\nfor when she died of small-pox at nineteen she was an accomplished\r\nyoung woman, on the road, apparently, to be the dangerous \"blazing\r\nstarre\" her mother decried, and her training must have been going on\r\nfor ten or twelve years in the home with the active connivance of her\r\nparents. Her father was exceedingly proud, not only of her excellence\r\nin dancing and music, but especially, it would seem, of her passion\r\nfor books. She had, he said, \"read abundance of history, and all\r\nthe best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil, Horace, Ovid;\r\nall the best romances and modern poems.\" After her death they found\r\namong her papers a commonplace book in which she had entered \"an\r\nincredible number of selections from historians, poets, travellers.\"\r\nHer piety and her impulse towards expression were both shown in the\r\nmany \"resolutions, contemplations, prayers and devotions\" she left\r\nin written form. Of the extent to which both Mrs. Evelyn and her\r\ndaughter carried their work in painting and enamel I have already\r\nspoken.[202]\r\n\r\nThe Evelyn household may stand doubtless as one of many where,\r\nwithout any tinge of pedantry or any especial outward manifestations\r\nof learning, there was yet a natural interest in arts and letters, an\r\ninterest shared, in quite a simple, normal way by all the members of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Honorable Miss Dudleya North (1675-1712)]\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Miss Dudleya North was a niece of the Honorable Roger\r\nNorth, and it is through the memorable _Lives of the Norths_ that\r\nwe come upon an account of her life. Dudleya and her two younger\r\nbrothers were brought up together. She learned the same lessons and\r\nread the same books as her brothers, and joined in their amusements.\r\nWhen they went to the University, she carried on her studies at\r\nhome and she became one of the most highly cultured and learned\r\nwomen of her time. After she had conquered Greek and Latin she\r\nadvanced to Hebrew, and finally, \"by a long and severe course of\r\nstudy,\" she gained \"a competent knowledge in the whole circle of\r\nOriental learning.\" Her uncle Roger laconically described her life as\r\nfollows: \"The eldest sister, Catharine, died ... and the youngest,\r\nnamed Dudleya, having emaciated herself with study whereby she had\r\nmade familiar to her, not only Greek and Latin, but the Oriental\r\nlanguages, under the infliction of a sedentery distemper, died also.\"\r\n\r\nThe fine collection of Oriental books left by Miss North was given\r\nby her brother, Lord North and Grey, to the parochial library at\r\nRougham in Norfolk. Her uncle wrote: \"I have had a design to build a\r\nparochial library at Rougham, and now shall finish it this summer,\r\nand placing my niece's books there, entitle the Catalogue _Ex dono_,\r\netc., _e libris eruditissimæ virginis_, etc., which will be a\r\nmonument more lasting than marble.\"[203]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne Lee, Lady Wharton (1632?-1685)]\r\n\r\nAnne Lee, the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Henry Lee, married in\r\n1673 Thomas Wharton, whose chief interest in her was based on the\r\nlarge dowry she brought him. The unhappiness of her married life\r\nreceived some alleviation from the wise and steadfast friendship of\r\nDr. Gilbert Burnet. In 1680-81, she was in France for her health\r\nand during this time she corresponded regularly with Dr. Burnet.\r\nHe addressed to her various poems with titles such as _The Secrets\r\nof Friendship_, _Friendship's Mysteries_, _Pure Love_, and _Love's\r\nMagnetism_. She wrote a tragedy in blank verse on the love of Ovid\r\nfor Julia, a number of Scripture paraphrases, and some occasional\r\npoems.[204] Some of these poems drew approving verses from Dryden in\r\nhis _Eleonora_, a panegyrical poem on the death of Mrs. Wharton's\r\nelder sister, Lady Abingdon, in 1691, and from Waller, who, in his\r\nold age, was still equal to flattering a new \"Chloris,\" under which\r\nname he celebrated her learning and her poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ann Baynard (1672-1697)]\r\n\r\nAnn Baynard had a natural propensity to learning and her father Dr.\r\nEdward Baynard, Fellow of the College of Physicians, London, gave her\r\na very liberal education. Dr. Prude[205] says of her:\r\n\r\n  As for learning, whether it be to know and understand natural\r\n  causes and events, to know the courses of the sun, moon, and\r\n  stars; the qualities of herbs and plants; to be acquainted with\r\n  the demonstrable verities of the mathematicks; the study of\r\n  philosophy; the writings of the antients; and that in their own\r\n  proper language, without the help of an interpreter: These and\r\n  the like are the most noble accomplishments of the human mind,\r\n  and accordingly do bring great delight and satisfaction along\r\n  with them, these things she was not only conversant in, but\r\n  mistress of, and that to such a degree, that very few of her sex\r\n  did ever arrive at. She had from her infancy been trained up in\r\n  the knowledge of these things, and had made a great progress\r\n  therein; and even in her green years, at the age of 23, was\r\n  arrived to the knowledge of a bearded philosopher.[206]\r\n\r\nShe was a \"nervous and subtle disputant\" in the \"hard and knotty\r\narguments of metaphysical learning.\" She was always coveting more\r\nknowledge, saying that it was a sin to be contented with but a\r\nlittle. She was exceedingly religious and learning was to her but a\r\nhandmaid of piety. Her last words were a recommendation to women to\r\nstudy philosophy and the great book of nature which would give them\r\na sound basis for wisdom in practical life. Women, she said, are\r\ncapable of such study, and could accomplish much if they would \"spend\r\nof that time in study and thinking, which they do in visits, vanity\r\nand folly.\" Mr. Collier, in the _Great Historical Dictionary_, says\r\nof her that it is doubtful whether the first Ralph Baynard, who for\r\nhis conduct at the battle of Hastings was rewarded with eighty-five\r\nlordships, did more honor to the name of Baynard or the last Anne.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Alicia D'Anvers (fl. 1691)]\r\n\r\n_Academia: or the Humours of the University of Oxford in burlesque\r\nverse_ is a thin quarto by Mrs. Alicia D'Anvers. It was printed in\r\nMay, 1691, and again with a fuller descriptive title in June of the\r\nsame year. The poem is an account given to his fellow-servants by\r\nJohn who has recently visited Oxford. Mrs. D'Anvers puts herself\r\nin John's place. She uses his crude and even rough language, she\r\ngives his point of view, and relishes the misconceptions due to\r\nhis ignorance. Heavy and clumsy as the poem is there is something\r\nrefreshing and original in its tone. As an attempted realistic\r\nportrayal of a servant's experiences it stands quite by itself,\r\nexcept in comedies, in the decades before the novel widened human\r\ninterests. Mrs. D'Anvers is neither patronizing nor didactic.\r\nShe simply finds genuine humor and entertainment in the comic\r\njuxtaposition of John's mind and the ancient customs and glories of\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lady Chudleigh (1656-1710)]\r\n\r\nLady Chudleigh[207] was a lady of much repute in the eighteenth\r\ncentury for her writings in both prose and verse. Her _Poems_ were\r\npublished in 1703 and her _Essays_ in 1710, but her chief literary\r\nactivities belong in the late seventeenth century. Her _Essays_ are\r\ndisquisitions on Pride, Humility, Self-love, Friendship, Death,\r\nAnger, Avarice, Solitude, and kindred themes. Mr. Ballard says of\r\nthem: \"They appear to be, not the excursions of a lively imagination\r\n... so much as the deliberate results of a long exercise in the\r\nworld, improv'd with reading, regulated with judgment; softened by\r\ngood breeding, and heightened with sprightly thoughts and elevated\r\npiety.\" Her prose style is fluent, energetic, and, for the most part,\r\ncorrect. In her Preface to her _Song of Three Children Paraphrased_\r\nshe makes several points that indicate mental independence. In the\r\nheight of the dominance of the heroic couplet she chooses Pindaric\r\nverse because she does not wish to be tied up to the rules of the\r\ncouplet, and because she desires to give her fancy greater scope.\r\nShe begs pardon for introducing into her poem ideas \"not generally\r\nreceived,\" such as Dr. Burnet's conception of the \"Ante-diluvian\r\nEarth as Smooth, regular, and uniform; without Mountains or Hills.\"\r\nConcerning her poetic use of the doctrine of preëxistence she says,\r\n\"To me 't is indifferent which is true, as long as I know I am by\r\nthe Laws of Poetry allow'd the Liberty of chusing that which will\r\nsound most gracefully in Verse.\" In regard to the stars she adopts\r\n\"the Cartesian Hypothesis\" because it makes the universe \"appear\r\ninfinitely larger, fuller, more magnificent.\" Her imagination is\r\nas genuinely excited as was Tennyson's by her conception of the\r\n\"boundless Spaces\" of the heavens and the splendor of the \"huge\r\nGlobes which roll over our Heads.\" She believes also in a millennial\r\nexistence on \"a new habitable earth.\" The poem itself is an unbroken\r\necstasy ninety long stanzas in duration, and becomes undeniably\r\nwearisome. But the woman who could spend months in a lonely country\r\nplace absorbed in such religious and scientific reflections, who\r\ncould maintain for so long a time so rapt and energetic a mental\r\nattitude towards abstract subjects, was far enough removed from the\r\ntraditional _hausfrau_.\r\n\r\nThough Lady Chudleigh rejoices in these learned topics she modestly\r\ndisclaims any accurate knowledge. \"But 't is not reasonable to\r\nexpect that a Woman should be nicely skill'd in Physics: We are kept\r\nStrangers to all ingenious and useful Studies, and can have but a\r\nslight and superficial Knowledge of things.\" Two poems, _Resolution_\r\nand _To Mr. Dryden on his excellent Translation of Virgil_, give\r\nevidence of Lady Chudleigh's wide reading in poetry, history, drama,\r\nand divinity. Her literary dicta are of little value, for they do\r\nhardly more than echo the judgments of the day. According to her it\r\nwas the poet Waller who, coming after the \"transient Glimm'rings of\r\nChaucer\" and the \"Lunar Beams of Spenser,\" announced the dawn of\r\na new Morn, and with Dryden came \"The Triumphs of refulgent Day.\"\r\nTaken as a whole the poems bitterly inveigh against life with its\r\nblighting sorrows, its fleeting, unreal joys, its injustice, its\r\nblack despairs. The only break in the gloom comes in short periods of\r\nabsorption in books, or in occasional religious ecstasies.\r\n\r\nThe first poem by which Lady Chudleigh became known is _The\r\nLadies' Defence_: a sudden, angry outburst caused by a sermon on\r\n_Conjugal Duty_ by a Mr. Sprint, a nonconformist in Sherbourn,\r\nDorsetshire.[208] The personal animus in a little poem _To the\r\nLadies_ warning them against marriage, apparently grew out of her own\r\nmatrimonial infelicities. And _The Ladies' Defence_ has the same ring\r\nof indignant sincerity. The poem is in the form of a conversation\r\nbetween the parson who preached the sermon; Sir William Loveall, who,\r\nout of the ignorance of his unmarried state, endeavors to reconcile\r\nthe warring parties; Marissa, Lady Chudleigh herself; and Sir John\r\nBrute, who thanks the parson for preaching against \"those Terrors of\r\nour Lives, those worst of Plagues, those Furies call'd our Wives.\"\r\nThe parson replies:\r\n\r\n      Not led by Passion, but by Zeal inspir'd,\r\n      I've told the Women what's of them requir'd:\r\n      Taught them their Husbands to Obey and Please,\r\n      And to their Humours sacrifice their Ease:\r\n      Give up their Reason, and their Wills resign,\r\n      And ev'ry look, and ev'ry thought confine.\r\n      Sure, this Detraction you can't justly call?\r\n      'T is kindly meant, and 't is address'd to All.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      If you wou'd live as it becomes a Wife,\r\n      And raise the Honour of a marry'd Life,\r\n      You must the useful Art of wheedling try,\r\n      And with his various Humours still comply;\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Whate'er he is, you still must think him best,\r\n      And boast to all that you are truly blest;\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Also, to him you inward Reverence owe;\r\n      If he's a Fool, you must not think him so;\r\n      Nor yet indulge one mean contemptuous Thought,\r\n      Or fancy he can e'er commit a Fault.\r\n      Nor must your Deference be alone confin'd\r\n      Unto the hid Recesses of your Mind,\r\n      But must in all your Actions be display'd,\r\n      And visible to each Spectator made.[209]\r\n\r\nAfter this sarcastic summary of Mr. Sprint's irritating sermon Lady\r\nChudleigh in the person of Marissa, depicts the general condition of\r\nwomen and her own loftier ambitions:\r\n\r\n      'T is hard we should be by the Men despis'd\r\n      Yet kept from knowing what would make us priz'd.\r\n      Debarr'd from Knowledge, banish'd from the Schools,\r\n      And with the utmost Industry bred Fools.\r\n      Laugh'd out of Reason, jested out of Sense,\r\n      And nothing left but Native Innocence:\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Or that my Sex would all such Toys despise;\r\n      And only study to be Good, and Wise:\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Instead of Novels, Histories peruse,\r\n      And for their Guides the wise Ancients chuse,\r\n      Thro' all the Labyrinths of Learning go,\r\n      And grow more humble as they more do know.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Beauty's a Trifle merits not my Care.\r\n      I'd rather Æsop's ugly Visage wear,\r\n      Joyn'd with his Mind, than be a Fool, and Fair.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      But spite of you, we'll to ourselves be kind:\r\n      Your censures slight, your little Tricks despise,\r\n      And make it our whole business to be wise.\r\n      The mean low trivial Cares of Life disdain,\r\n      And read and Think, and Think and read again,\r\n      And on our Minds bestow the utmost Pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anne Kingsmill, Lady Winchilsea (1661-1720)]\r\n\r\nOne of the important women of letters in the late seventeenth century\r\nwas Anne Kingsmill.[210] Of her early life we have no definite\r\ndetails. That it was a gay and happy life may be inferred from one\r\nof her retrospective poems in which she says that in her youth\r\n\"Pleasure's tempting Air\" blew soft about her, and that she dedicated\r\nher \"Prime\" to \"vain Amusements.\" Later she coveted a place at court\r\nwhich to her ambitious eye seemed \"Paradice below.\" At what time this\r\ndesire was realized we have no record, but in 1683 we find her listed\r\nas one of the maids of honor to Mary of Modena. Miss Strickland says\r\nthat Anne Killigrew and Anne Kingsmill were \"ladies of irreproachable\r\nvirtue, members of the Church of England, and alike distinguished\r\nfor moral worth and literary achievements,\" and she adds that Anne\r\nKingsmill was \"well-known as the beautiful and witty maid of honour.\"\r\nIn 1684 Anne married Mr. Finch, gentleman of the bedchamber to\r\nthe Duke of York. At the coming of William and Mary, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nFinch went to the family place at Eastwell Park where they spent\r\nthe rest of their uneventful lives in a retirement, embittered at\r\nfirst, doubtless, by their grief over Stuart disasters, but, as\r\nthe years passed, rendered more and more delightful by the joys of\r\ncountry life, of books, and of friends. Mrs. Finch's best poems are\r\nthose inspired by Eastwell and its associations. The Elizabethan\r\nhouse at Eastwell was set in a park of old yew trees and majestic\r\nbeeches, forming \"the very ideal of an ancestral park of the ancient\r\nnoblesse,\" and it was by the extraordinary dignity and beauty of this\r\npark that Mrs. Finch's most imaginative work was inspired. Within\r\ndoors the gathering of antiquities, the illuminating of books,\r\nthe formation of a great library, and free literary productivity\r\nwere the family interests. There were also many and close ties of\r\nfriendship founded on natural causes of union such as loyalty to the\r\nStuarts, devotion to the Church of England, high and even austere\r\nideals of life. And family ties and ties of friendship received\r\nardent acknowledgment. No woman of this period was more happily\r\ncircumstanced in her home for the unhampered pursuit of literary\r\ntastes than was Lady Winchilsea. She began to write when she was a\r\nmaid of honor, but it was with a nervous sense of the ridicule that\r\nwould probably follow any disclosure of that fact. But at Eastwell\r\nthe case was different. There are charming pictures of evening\r\nsessions when the authoress presented her work to an enthusiastic\r\ncircle. A scribe entered her writings in a fair and clerkly hand in a\r\nmajestic folio. With such encouragement the lady kept sedulously and\r\njoyfully to her task. And when her husband's accession to the title\r\ngave her a new position of dignity and authority she even ventured,\r\nin 1713,[211] to publish a selection from her verse, first under the\r\npseudonym \"Ardelia,\" and then, in a later impression, with her full\r\nname and title.\r\n\r\nLady Winchilsea's poems were composed between 1683 and 1720, and\r\nduring this period she tried nearly all poetic forms. Songs, satires,\r\nfables, tragedies, translations, are fully represented. She was\r\nthe most voluminous of the minor poets of her time, and in vigor\r\nand scope she outranks most of them. But her literary importance\r\nto-day rests not so much on the amount or variety of her work, as\r\non the fact that in an age of didacticism and satire she delicately\r\nforeshadowed tastes that ruled in the romanticism of a century\r\nlater. It was her _Nocturnal Reverie_, with its minute accuracy of\r\nobservation, its sense of the mystery of nature and of the mystic\r\nunion between man and nature, that secured Wordsworth's praise,\r\ngave her an honorable place in Ward's _English Poets_, and finally\r\nestablished her in the heaven of literary fame as, in Mr. Gosse's\r\nphrase, \"a minor excelsitude.\"\r\n\r\nIn the present study quite other points are to be made concerning\r\nLady Winchilsea. She is particularly interesting when considered as\r\na heretic against certain prevailing social and educational ideals.\r\nIn the gay dissipations of court life under Charles II she maintained\r\na conception of life serious and even austere. In close association\r\nwith Mary of Modena and James II she yet maintained her devotion\r\nto the Church of England. With the world of fashion flocking to\r\nthe comedies of the Restoration dramatists she yet condemned the\r\nimmoralities of the stage with the bitterness of a Jeremy Collier.\r\nThere was, then, in Lady Winchilsea an independence of judgment, a\r\nstoutness of fiber in forming and defending her own views, which\r\nwould lead one to expect some trenchant remarks on the contemporary\r\nattitude towards women. It is much to be regretted that the letters\r\nof Lady Winchilsea, if any are extant, have never been published. Her\r\ninterests were so varied, her friendships so ardent, her hours of\r\ncountry leisure so numerous, her pen so facile, that she must have\r\nfound, in what Anne Seward called \"epistolary solicitudes,\" one\r\nof the most convenient outlets for a spirit often kicking against\r\nthe pricks of social conventions, and her keenness of insight,\r\nher caustic phrasing, would make her letters worth many pages of\r\npindarics. But in default of such letters we turn to the one prose\r\nessay and to the poems. From scattered passages we can build up the\r\nelements of her heresies. Though she loved her home and was the most\r\ndevoted of wives, she utterly rejected the _hausfrau_ theory of life.\r\nShe declared that she, at least, was never meant for \"the dull manage\r\nof a servile house.\" She asked little of her table except that it\r\nshould be \"set without her care.\" Rich food and elaborate service\r\ncould be dispensed with, but leisure and a free mind she must have.\r\nThe frivolous occupations of the town lady, the endless discussions\r\nof laces and brocades, the rivalries as to dishes and screens from\r\nChina, the gossip and ill-natured jests at fashionable tea-tables,\r\nshe found unendurable. Feminine accomplishments, such as embroidery,\r\namateurish drawing and painting, awakened her active hostility.\r\n\r\nThis definite rejection of all that ordinarily filled the feminine\r\nmind, and a rejection, moreover, in the interests of books and\r\nwriting, of course made Ardelia the unhappy victim of many a sneer.\r\nThe attack on her by Pope and Gay, in _Three Hours after Marriage_,\r\nin 1717, may be taken as an extreme example of the indignities to\r\nwhich \"a petticoat author\" might be subjected, but there must have\r\nbeen many lesser evidences of social disapproval or the irritating\r\ntheme would not so often recur in her poems. In \"The Introduction\"\r\nshe says:\r\n\r\n      Alas! a woman that attempts the pen,\r\n      Such an intruder on the rights of men,\r\n      Such a presumptuous Creature, is esteem'd,\r\n      The fault, can by no vertue be redeem'd.\r\n      They tell us, we mistake our sex and way;\r\n      Good breeding, fassion, dancing, dressing, play\r\n      Are the accomplishments we should desire;\r\n      To write, or read, or think, or to enquire\r\n      Would cloud our beauty, and exhaust our time,\r\n      And interrupt the Conquests of our prime.\r\n\r\nShe congratulates herself that she had at least had the good sense\r\nto keep her rhymes a secret while at court, where a \"Versifying\r\nMaid of Honour\" would have been looked upon \"with prejudice, if not\r\nwith contempt.\" During a visit to London she heard the young gossip\r\nAlmeria describe a certain lady as \"A Poetess! a woman who writes!\r\nA common jest!\" Conscious of her growing folio at Eastwell, Ardelia\r\nresented the implied censure. What law, she asks, forbids women\r\nto think? Women, she protests, are \"Education's and not Nature's\r\nfools.\" Ardelia had high praise from noted contemporaries and cordial\r\nappreciation at home. But these did not avail to conquer her morbid\r\nsensitiveness to criticism. She seemed to embody in herself two\r\nwarring tendencies, a demand for complete intellectual freedom and\r\nthe author's inevitable desire to spread his wares abroad, with the\r\nshrinking modesty of the lady to whom any sort of publicity was\r\nhateful.\r\n\r\nThe \"Matchless Orinda,\" Lady Winchilsea tells us, was the model on\r\nwhom, from her early girlhood she formed herself. The first verses\r\nshe wrote were in honor of Orinda. By Orinda's example she justified\r\nthe efforts and aims of her own muse, but she is in no sense a\r\ncopyist. It was Orinda's fame as a noted and virtuous woman poet\r\nthat inspired her rather than any close study of Orinda's work. Lady\r\nWinchilsea, in that small portion of her work on which her fame\r\nrests, is very delicately and truly original. Her spirit reacted\r\nagainst court life as definitely as did Anne Killigrew's, but she\r\nfound no satisfaction in satiric comment. She shrank from any sort of\r\ncontest. She argued and protested only when pushed to the wall. She\r\nwas shy and easily intimidated, and her best work does not come from\r\nthe heat of conflict or from bitterness of spirit. She is essentially\r\ncontemplative. The poems on which her fame rests blossomed out\r\nquietly, exquisitely, under the gentle stimulus of a happy home life\r\nin the midst of lovely natural surroundings. She is typically a\r\nlady of letters because, without the spur of necessity, urged on by\r\nno popular applause, she yet, for more than thirty years, made the\r\nreading of books and the writing of books the central occupation of\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Honorable Mrs. Monck (d. 1715)]\r\n\r\nThe honorable Mrs. Monck[212] was the daughter of Lord Molesworth, a\r\nnobleman of Ireland. Mr. Ballard says of her learning: \"She, purely\r\nby force of her own natural genius, acquired a perfect knowledge of\r\nthe Latin, Italian and Spanish tongues: and by a constant reading of\r\nthe finest authors in those languages, became so great a mistress of\r\nthe art of poetry, that she wrote many poems for her own diversion.\"\r\nIn 1716, after her death, Lord Molesworth published her poems under\r\nthe title _Marinda. Poems and Translations on Several Occasions._ In\r\nhis dedication to Caroline, the Princess of Wales, he says that the\r\nbook represents the works of the leisure hours of a young gentlewoman\r\nin a remote country solitude, with no assistance but that of a good\r\nlibrary, and with the daily care of a large family on her hands. In\r\ncommending her character he says, \"I loved her more _because she\r\ndeserved it, than because she was mine_.\" Various slight poems show\r\nMarinda's knowledge of Italian and Spanish. Better than all these\r\nare two cleverly turned epigrams on \"a lady of pleasure,\" and some\r\naffecting farewell lines written in her last sickness to her husband.\r\nMrs. Monck's repute for learning comes largely by hearsay, her\r\nprinted memorials are slight and unimportant, but she nevertheless\r\ngives an impression, elusive but real, of a most interesting\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Martha, Lady Giffard (1639-1722)]\r\n\r\nLady Giffard was Sir William Temple's sister. She was twelve years\r\nyounger than Dorothy. After her marriage and almost immediate\r\nwidowhood, in 1661, she made her home with the Temples. Her _Life\r\nand Correspondence_ has been published by Mrs. Longe as a sequel to\r\nthe _Letters of Dorothy Osborne_. The volume contains letters from\r\nLady Chesterfield, from Lady Sunderland (\"Saccharissa\"), and others,\r\nto Lady Giffard. The letters by Lady Giffard are few in number and\r\nare all written to her niece Lady Berkeley, later Lady Portland, and\r\nbelong in the years 1697-1722. These letters have none of the sparkle\r\nand humor and literary charm of Dorothy's. But we get indications\r\nthat Lady Giffard was a woman of intellectual interests. We find\r\nher reading Turkish history daytimes with recourse to Virgil, \"as\r\nless exacting,\" for evenings. She knew Spanish and French, and one\r\nof the specific items in her will is a bequest of the books she had\r\ncollected in these two languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sarah Byng, Mrs. Osborne (1693-1775)]\r\n\r\nA third series of letters, published under the title _Political\r\nand Social Letters of a Lady of the Eighteenth Century_, though\r\nbelonging later in the century, may be brought in here because they\r\ncarry on the series of Osborne letters. Sarah Byng, the daughter of\r\nAdmiral Byng, Viscount Torrington, married, in 1710, John Osborne\r\nof Chicksands Priory, the old home of Dorothy and the place from\r\nwhich she wrote most of her letters. Mr. John Osborne was Dorothy's\r\ngrand-nephew. He died in 1719 and his father in 1720, leaving to\r\nSarah Osborne an infant son, Danvers, the heir to the title and a\r\nheavily burdened estate. Her letters fall in several series, the\r\nfirst set from 1721 to 1739 being to her brother George on business\r\nmatters concerning the property. Most interesting are the letters\r\nto Danvers from 1733 to 1751. When he came of age in 1736 she was\r\nable to turn over to him an unincumbered estate, and on his marriage\r\nin 1740 she superintended the establishment of the new household at\r\nChicksands. A third set of letters has to do with the sentence and\r\nexecution of her brother Admiral Byng, in 1757. Through the death of\r\nthe wife of Danvers in 1743 and the death of Danvers in 1750 Mrs.\r\nOsborne was left with two grandsons to bring up, and her last letters\r\nare to John, one of these grandsons, who was traveling in Holland.\r\n\r\nThrough two generations Mrs. Osborne bore heavy administrative and\r\nfinancial burdens. She was both father and mother to her son, and\r\nthen to her grandsons. And she was left single-handed to conduct\r\nthe defense of her brother Admiral Byng. It is not strange that\r\nthe letters are frequently hurried and harassed in tone. She is\r\nconstantly vexed and baffled because, as a woman, she cannot conduct\r\naffairs directly. Some man must be her intermediary. She lays plans,\r\nforesees difficulties, writes explicit directions, and then she must\r\nurge and cajole her representative to due interest and prompt action.\r\nThe especial interest in her letters is their abundant and exact\r\naccount of social life and especially of domestic economy. Energetic,\r\ncourageous, resourceful, keenly observant, and with a clear head for\r\nbusiness, Mrs. Osborne shows herself to be. Perhaps if we had her\r\nletters before the burdens of life fell so heavily upon her we might\r\nfind some hint of the charm in Dorothy's letters, for even Dorothy's\r\nletters after marriage became \"tame and flat to what was before.\"\r\nAs it is, Mrs. Osborne's letters are valuable for scattered social\r\ndetail, not for any permanent charm of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elizabeth Singer, Mrs. Rowe (1674-1737)]\r\n\r\nMr. Walter Singer, a dissenting minister of Frome, was early left a\r\nwidower with three daughters. Two of these daughters showed while\r\nstill young exceptionally good minds and a natural interest in\r\nstudy. One daughter, who died at nineteen, was devoted to medicine\r\nand collected books on that subject. Elizabeth preferred drawing and\r\npoetry. She began drawing when her fingers could hardly hold the\r\npencil, and she squeezed out the juices of plants to make colors. Her\r\nfather furnished her an excellent master, and she attained sufficient\r\nskill so that throughout her life her work was highly prized by\r\nher friends. She also loved music \"to excess.\" But poetry was her\r\nchief delight. She began writing at twelve, and by the time she\r\nwas twenty-two she had on hand a store of verse so pleasing to her\r\nfriends that they insisted on its publication, and there accordingly\r\nappeared a thin little volume in 1696 under the title _Poems on\r\nSeveral Occasions. Written by Philomela._ The \"Preface to the\r\nReader,\" by one Elizabeth Johnson, is another of many contemporary\r\nindications of feminine irritation at the limitations imposed\r\nupon them. Miss Johnson allows \"Mankind the _Brutal Advantages of\r\nStrength_,\" but when they \"wou'd Monopolize _Sence_ too, when neither\r\nthat, nor Learning, nor so much as _Wit_\" is granted the women, they\r\nare forced to protest against such \"_notorious_ Violations on the\r\n_Liberties of Free-born English Women_.\" \"This makes the _Meekest\r\nWorm_ amongst us all, ready to turn agen when we are thus _trampled_\r\non; But alas! What can we do to _Right_ our selves? _stingless_ and\r\n_harmless_ as we are, we can only _Kiss_ the _Foot_ that _hurts_\r\nus.\" But it sometimes pleases Heaven to succor a distressed people\r\nby sending them some bright genius, \"an Epaminondas, a Timoleon,\r\na Nassaw.\" \"Nor is our _Defenceless Sex_ forgotten--we have not\r\nonly _Banduca's_ and _Zenobia's_, but _Sappho's_, and _Behn's_, and\r\n_Schurman's_, and _Orinda's_, who have _humbled_ the most haughty\r\nof our Antagonists, and made 'em do Homage to our _Wit_, as well\r\nas our _Beauty_.\" Miss Singer's consent to the publication of this\r\nvolume was gained only by a promise of strict anonymity, and the\r\n\"Philomela,\" then chosen as a pen-name through a naïve adaptation of\r\n\"Singer,\" became her permanent appellation.\r\n\r\nOne interesting fact with regard to these early poems is the\r\nindication we have of a kind of poetical commerce maintained among\r\nthe members of a group of persons similarly inclined to verse.\r\nPhilomela writes a _Pindarick Poem on Habbakuk_ which she sends to\r\n\"The Athenians\" and they respond with a poem beginning,\r\n\r\n      We yield! we yield! the Palm, bright Maid! be thine!\r\n\r\nShe sends a _Poetical Question_ to the Athenians and gets a long\r\nanswer. _The Vanity of the World_ and _The Wish_ are likewise\r\naddressed to the Athenians and have similar responses. In a\r\n_Pindarick to the Athenian Society_ she brings as \"_Zealous\r\nTribute_,\" \"The early products of a Female muse,\" praising especially\r\ntheir piety and heroic sentiments and the courage with which they\r\nhave lashed the darling vices of the times.\r\n\r\n      A friendship so exalted and immense,\r\n      A _female breast_ did ne'er before commence.\r\n\r\nA little poem in humorous vein, _To one that persuades me to leave\r\nthe Muses_, gives some account of her school-days. \"I fairly bid\r\nthe Boarding Schools farewell,\" \"Old Governess farewell with all my\r\nheart,\" are lines indicative of her attitude.\r\n\r\n      Spite of her heart, _Old Puss_ shall damn no more\r\n      Great _Sedley's_ Plays, and never look 'em o're;\r\n      Affront my _Novels_, no, nor in a Rage,\r\n      Force _Dryden's_ lofty Products from the Stage,\r\n      Whilst all the rest of the _melodious crew_,\r\n      With the _whole_ System of _Athenians_ too,\r\n      For Study's sake out of the Window flew.\r\n      But I, to Church, shall fill her Train no more,\r\n      And walk as if I sojurn'd by the hour.\r\n\r\nIn like vein she bids adieu to \"dancing days,\" singing lessons,\r\nJapan work, and even her \"esteemed Pencil,\" and vows to give herself\r\nto poetry. And true it is that the rest of her life is mainly of\r\nliterary and pious significance. When young her beauty and charm had\r\nresulted in \"a train of lovers,\" but no one of them, not even Mr.\r\nPrior, the poet, could lure her from her serene solitude--possibly\r\nbecause she was \"destined by heaven for the possession of another\r\ngentleman.\" At any rate, she went smoothly on with her chosen\r\nliterary life till she was thirty-six, when she married Mr. Thomas\r\nRowe, thirteen years younger than herself, but of like tastes and\r\nhimself an author. Their extraordinarily happy life together was\r\nbrought to a close by his death in 1715, and, after this five years\r\nof happiness, she spent the twenty-seven years of her widowhood\r\nin a stricter solitude, a more absorbed religious communion, a\r\ncompleter devotion to literary pursuits, than before her marriage.\r\nHer essays, her poems, her letters, were the events of her life. She\r\nhad early come to know the family of Lord Weymouth at Longleate.\r\nMr. Thynne had taught her French and Italian; various members of\r\nthe family and various family events were celebrated in her verse.\r\nShe was on most intimate terms with the Countess of Hertford and\r\ncorresponded with her for many years. Over a hundred of her letters\r\nto the Countess were published in _The Works of Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe\r\nand Mr. Thomas Rowe_, and though they make dull and monotonous\r\nreading now were highly esteemed at the time. In fact, the modest and\r\nanonymous Philomela had great eighteenth-century vogue. She had the\r\nfriendship of many in the great world, she was abundantly praised\r\nby poets and divines, and her works went through numerous editions.\r\nHer husband said that she combined the fire and passion of Aphra\r\nBehn with the chaste purity of Mrs. Katherine Philips. But Astræa's\r\npassion underwent some strange alchemy when it was transmuted into\r\nPhilomela's religious ecstasy. Orinda's purity was fatal to the\r\ncombination. Yet Mrs. Rowe's \"divine transports\" have--Mr. Watts\r\nadmits it--sometimes a soft and passionate sound, even an amorous\r\nnote, capable of misinterpretation, but evidently reminiscent of\r\nthe _Songs of Solomon_, beloved of her youth. It was not an age for\r\nenthusiasms and ecstasies. That her \"flights\" were so popular may\r\npossibly be explained by the fact that through them all she was\r\ncuriously prosaic and intellectually commonplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Bland (1660?-1765?)]\r\n\r\nMr. Ballard speaks of \"Mrs. Bland,[213] a Yorkshire gentlewoman so\r\nwell skilled in Hebrew that she taught it to her son and daughter.\"\r\nMrs. Bland was born about 1660 and married Mr. Nathaniel Bland in\r\n1681. Her instructor in Hebrew was Lord Van Helmont from whom she\r\nlearned to write the language with great exactness. At the request\r\nof Mr. Thoresby she wrote a Phylactery in Hebrew and presented it to\r\nthe Royal Society, where it was preserved among their curiosities.\r\nMr. Bland became Lord of the Manor at Beeston and Mr. Thoresby\r\nvisited him there. To the astonishment of the guest Martha Bland, the\r\nyoung daughter of the house, was translating Hebrew into English,\r\nhaving been taught by \"that ingenious gentlewoman,\" her mother. Four\r\nyears later Mr. Thoresby took his son Ralph to see \"Mrs. Bland,\r\nthe Hebrician.\" She had also studied Anglo-Saxon, for she borrowed\r\nElizabeth Elstob's book from Mr. Thoresby and kept it long enough to\r\ncopy out the grammar part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miss Jane Barker (fl. 1688-1723)]\r\n\r\nMiss Jane Barker is a literary lady whose productions belong in\r\ntwo epochs. Her collected poems appeared in 1688 under the title\r\n_Poetical Recreations: Consisting of Original Poems, Songs,\r\nOdes, etc. With Several New Translations. In Two Parts, Part I.\r\nOccasionally Written by Mrs. Jane Barker. Part II. By Several\r\nGentlemen of the Universities, and Others._ Twenty-seven years after\r\nthe publication of this verse Miss Barker again came before the\r\npublic, this time as a writer of romances which proved very popular.\r\nThey were collected under the title _The Entertaining Novels of Mrs.\r\nJane Barker_, and a second edition had appeared by 1719. In 1723 she\r\nbrought out _A Patch-Work Screen for the Ladies; or Love and Virtue\r\nRecommended: In a Collection of Instructive Novels. Related after a\r\nManner intirely New, and interspersed with Rural Poems, describing\r\nthe Innocence of a Country Life. By Mrs. Jane Barker, of Wilsthorp,\r\nnear Stamford, in Lincolnshire._[214]\r\n\r\nThe long silence between the verse of 1688 and the romances of\r\n1715-26 is unbroken by any explanatory hint or reference. Yet Miss\r\nBarker had but one story to tell and that was told in her youth. In\r\nher novels she uses the characters, events, and emotions recorded in\r\nher early verse. Under the form of a sustained narration, with the\r\naddition of much in the way of romantic adventure, they make more\r\nentertaining reading, but offer no essentially new elements. The\r\nfifth novel, _Clodius and Scipiana_, is perhaps but an enlargement\r\nof a romance entitled _Scipina_, which had been published and\r\nconcerning which she had received several congratulatory poems,\r\nbefore 1688.[215]\r\n\r\nOne persistent element in Miss Barker's verse and prose is\r\nautobiographic reference. Especially is this true of the poems,\r\n_The Amours of Bosvil and Galesia_ and _A Patch-Work Screen_. From\r\nthese sources various facts emerge concerning Miss Barker's life and\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nShe says that she was sent at first to the \"Putney School,\" but\r\nthat she was taken home at about ten by her mother who had come to\r\nconsider such schools as \"Academies of Vanity and Expense, no Way\r\ninstructive in the Rudiments of a Country Gentlewoman's Life.\" At\r\nfifteen she was sent to London under the care of an aunt to learn\r\n\"Town Politeness.\"[216] Her father lived near Cambridge,[217] and\r\nthrough her brother, a Cambridge man, she was well known in the\r\nyounger literary set at the University. The praise accorded her\r\nverse was excessive. \"Philaster\" of St. John's hails her as the true\r\nheiress of the great Orinda. To \"C. G.\" she is the Elijah for whose\r\nmantle meaner poets wait. \"Exilius,\" also of St. John's, celebrates\r\nthe miracles of her Almighty Pen. \"S. C.\" wonders to see men \"tug at\r\nClassic Oars\" and \"sweat over Horace\" when along comes a lady who\r\nwithout effort utters \"well-shapt Fancy and true Digested Thought.\"\r\n\"Fidelius\" rejoices to see \"Physick and Anatomie done into purest\r\nVerse.\" And \"J. N.,\" Fellow of St. John's, praises her Scipina as\r\nwrit in lines,\r\n\r\n      More than Astrea's soft, more than Orinda's Chaste.\r\n\r\nAnother gentleman from St. John's said that she surpassed \"the\r\nScaroons and Scudderies of France\" and showed that England could\r\noriginate as well as translate.[218] Miss Barker was evidently in the\r\nstimulating and unusual position of being the temporary literary idol\r\nof an academic coterie.\r\n\r\nThere was a false lover in Miss Barker's early life who, as\r\n\"Strephon\" in verse[219] and as \"Bosvil\" in prose,[220] is copiously\r\nwritten up along with her own emotional experiences as \"Galesia.\"\r\nThe most interesting portion of the affair has to do with Galesia's\r\noriginal ways of reëstablishing her happiness. She found comfort in\r\ncontemplating the wonderful works of Creation.[221] She wandered\r\nalong shady paths, by little streams, and through the meadows. She\r\nloved the early morning, the evening dews, the starry night sky.\r\nThere is no felicitous phrasing in the references to nature, but\r\nthe fact remains that Galesia found in nature a satisfaction and\r\nsometimes an exaltation quite foreign to the heroines of her time.\r\n\r\nGalesia's second resource is study. She says of this new occupation:\r\n\r\n  Finding myself abandon'd by _Bosvil_ and thinking it impossible\r\n  ever to love any Mortal more, resolv'd to espouse a Book, and\r\n  spend my Days in Study ... I imagin'd my self the _Orinda_ or\r\n  _Sapho_ of my Time. In order to this, I got my brother, who\r\n  was not yet return'd to Oxford,[222] to set me in the way to\r\n  learn my Grammar, which he really did, thinking it ... a Freak\r\n  without Foundation to be overthrown by the first Difficulty I\r\n  shou'd meet with in the Syntax, knowing it to be less easy to\r\n  make Substantive and Adjective agree, than to place a Patch or\r\n  Curl.[223]\r\n\r\nHer indulgent brother, when he came back from his studies abroad,\r\nalso taught her medicine. With him she went on long \"simpling\"\r\nexcursions to gather flowers for the \"large natural Herbal\" they were\r\nmaking. With him she read \"Bartholine, Walæus, Harvey, his Circulatio\r\nSanguinis, and Lower's Motion of the Heart.\"[224] She learned to\r\nwrite prescriptions, or \"bills\" as she called them, in Latin, with\r\nthe same \"Cyphers and Directions as Doctors do,\" so that even the\r\napothecaries were misled and filled her \"bills\" with those of the\r\nregular physicians.[225] She also ventured on something in the way\r\nof practice and gained some repute for curing cases of gout given up\r\nby the doctors.[226] She began to abandon the Muses for Paracelsus.\r\nOr if she wrote poems the processes of digestion and the circulation\r\nof the blood were her themes.[227] If the shackles of rhyme hindered\r\nscientific accuracy of statement, she squared herself with facts by\r\nabundant footnotes in which the proper Latin terminology was given\r\nfull scope. Her interest in medicine was a vital one. She even thanks\r\nStrephon, through whose falsity she had been driven to study, and had\r\nso gained a joy beyond \"the sottish ease\" that waits on love. In her\r\nnew love of learning she even took a vow of virginity:\r\n\r\n      In this happy life let me remain,\r\n      Fearless of twenty-five and all its train\r\n      Of slights or scorns, or being call'd Old Maid,\r\n      Those Goblings which so many have betray'd.[228]\r\n\r\nSomewhat later Galesia gained a complete victory over her lovelorn\r\nself by a most original and sensible method. She took entire charge\r\nof her father's farm. She planned the work, hired the laborers,\r\nsuperintended in person the occupations of each day, paid the wages,\r\nand kept the accounts. The wholesome interests of each day and\r\nequally wholesome fatigue at night left no intervals in which to\r\nregret her lost lover.[229]\r\n\r\nGalesia's recourse to hard study and responsible farm management\r\nas a cure for a wounded heart sets her as a heroine in a class by\r\nherself. She is so sensible and reasonable as to seem out of place\r\nin a romance. It is therefore something of a surprise to find her\r\nout-distancing the most sentimental in sighs and sobs and tears. Her\r\nutterance in recounting the baseness of Bosvil, \"It is fitting that I\r\nshould weep on all occasions,\" might serve as her permanent order of\r\nbusiness. \"My sighs alternately blew up my Tears and my Tears allay'd\r\nmy Sighs\" till \"fresh Reflections rais'd new Gusts of Sorrow,\"\r\ndescribes her stormy woes. Sometimes she is able to restrain \"the\r\nbriny Ebullition,\" but usually \"a new Flux of Tears\" breaks down all\r\nbarriers.\r\n\r\nWith the death of her brother the joy of Galesia's life went out.\r\nBooks and medicine lost their charm. Without his inspiring presence\r\nall her occupations became insipid. Her view of learned women also\r\nchanged. She says a learned woman is as ridiculous as a spinning\r\nHercules; that books are as unfit for women as paint, washes, and\r\npatches are for a man; that a studious woman and an effeminate man\r\nmay be classed together as out of their sphere. A learned woman is\r\n\"like a Forc'd Plant that never has its due or proper Relish but\r\nis wither'd by the first Blast,\" or \"like the Toad in the Fable,\r\nthat affected to swell itself as big as the Ox,\" and burst in the\r\nenterprise.[230] This bitter view of learning comes only in the\r\nnovels, and probably indicates some unhappy experiences on Miss\r\nBarker's part since the days when her muse was honored by the\r\nUniversity wits.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Celia Fiennes (fl. 1691-1703)]\r\n\r\nCelia Fiennes was the daughter of Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes and the\r\nsister of the third Viscount Saye and Sele. The one book by which she\r\nis known is _Through England on a Side Saddle in the Time of William\r\nand Mary, Being the Diary of Celia Fiennes_, first published in 1888\r\nby the Honorable Mrs. Griffith, to whom the original manuscript\r\nwas given by her father, the thirteenth Baron Saye and Sele. In\r\nher interesting \"To the Reader\" Miss Fiennes explains that these\r\njourneys were undertaken that she might regain her health by \"variety\r\nand change of aire and exercise\"; that she picked up such information\r\nas came in her way because her mind could not remain totally\r\nunoccupied; and that she wrote down her observations merely for the\r\npleasure of her near relations, the manuscript not being designed for\r\nmore public use. She then proceeds to justify her travels:\r\n\r\n  Now thus much without vanity may be asserted of the subject,\r\n  that if all persons, both Ladies, much more Gentlemen, would\r\n  spend some of their tyme in Journeys to visit their native\r\n  Land, and be curious to Inform themselves and make observations\r\n  of the pleasant prospects, good buildings, different produces\r\n  and manufactures of each place, with the variety of sports and\r\n  recreations they are adapt to, would be a souveraign remedy to\r\n  cure or preserve ffrom these Epidemick diseases of vapours,\r\n  should I add Laziness?--it would also fform such an Idea of\r\n  England, add much to its Glory and Esteem in our minds and\r\n  cure the evil Itch of over-valueing fforeign parts; at least\r\n  ffurnish them with an Equivalent to entertain strangers when\r\n  amongst us, Or jnform them when abroad of their native Country,\r\n  which has been often a Reproach to the English, ignorance and\r\n  being strangers to themselves. Nay the Ladies might have matter\r\n  not unworthy their observation, soe subject for conversation,\r\n  within their own compass in each country to which they relate,\r\n  and thence studdy now to be serviceable to their neighbours\r\n  especially the poor among whome they dwell, which would spare\r\n  them the uneasye thoughts how to pass away tedious dayes, and\r\n  tyme would not be a burden when not at a card or dice table,\r\n  and the ffashions and manners of fforeign parts less minded\r\n  and desired.... But now I may be justly blamed to pretend to\r\n  give acc: of our Constitution, Customs, Laws, Lect, matters\r\n  farre above my Reach or capacity, but herein I have described\r\n  what have come within my knowledge either by view and reading,\r\n  or relation from others which according to my conception have\r\n  faithfully Rehearsed, but where I have mistaken in any form\r\n  or subject matter I easily submitt to a correction and will\r\n  enter such Erratas in a supplement annext to y^e Book of some\r\n  particulars since remark'd; and shall conclude with a hearty wish\r\n  and recommendation to all, but Especially my own Sex, the studdy\r\n  of those things which tends to Improve the mind and makes our\r\n  Lives pleasant and comfortable as well as proffitable in all the\r\n  Stages and Stations of our Lives, and render suffering and age\r\n  supportable and Death less fformidable and a future State more\r\n  happy.[231]\r\n\r\nMiss Fiennes's separate journeys are not dated, but we know that\r\nthey began before 1691 because the earlier trips from her home at\r\nNewtontony in Wiltshire to Bath, to Oxfordshire, to \"Salsebury,\"\r\nwere taken with her mother, and her mother died in 1691. The\r\ndescription of the coronation of Queen Anne would indicate that the\r\ntravels extended beyond 1703. \"My Northern Journey in May 1697\"\r\nwas one of the most important of her travels. She thus records its\r\nclose: \"Thence to Highgate 6 miles, thence to London 4 miles where\r\nI returned and all our Company Blessed be God very well w^{th}out\r\nany disaster or trouble in 7 weeks tyme about 635 miles that we went\r\ntogether.\"[232] Cambridge, Ely, Peterborough, Nottingham, Lincoln,\r\nHull, and Scarborough, indicate their general route north. Encouraged\r\nby the success of this difficult trip, Miss Fiennes determined upon a\r\nstill more hazardous enterprise. \"My great Journey to Newcastle and\r\nto Cornwall\"[233] records a remarkable achievement. She went north to\r\nPeterborough; then west to Chester; then north by way of Liverpool,\r\nPreston, Lancaster, Kendall, Lake Windermere, Ambleside, Ulswater,\r\nPenrith, Carlisle, and so over into the edge of Scotland; then east\r\nto Newcastle; then southwest by Durham, Manchester, Worcester,\r\nExeter, Plymouth, Land's End; and finally home to Newtontony.\r\n\r\nArthur Young is famous for his English tours, but his travels\r\nare nearly three quarters of a century later than those of Miss\r\nFiennes.[234] Gray's notable visit to the Lakes was in 1769. In\r\n1756-1766 Amory, in his _Life of John Buncle_, described the Lake\r\nRegion, and as early as 1760 Dr. Brown wrote a letter praising the\r\nLakes. But Celia Fiennes's visit and description belong at the very\r\nbeginning of the century and confer upon her the honors belonging to\r\nthe pioneer. Her book has also a distinctive interest of its own.\r\nI cannot forbear to quote her account of her journey through the\r\nWestmoreland Hills:\r\n\r\n  Thence I Rode almost all the waye in sight of this great water\r\n  [Windermere], some tymes I lost it by reason of y^e great hills\r\n  interposeing and so a Continu'd up hill and down hill and that\r\n  pretty steep, even when I was in that they Called bottoms w^{ch}\r\n  are very rich good ground, and so I gained by degrees from Lower\r\n  to higher hills w^{ch} I alwayes went up and down before I came\r\n  to another hill. At last I attained to the side of one of these\r\n  hills or ffells of Rocks, w^{ch} I passed on the side much about\r\n  the Middle, for Looking down to the bottom it was at Least a Mile\r\n  all full of those Lesser hills and jnclosures, so Looking upward\r\n  I was as farre from the Top which was all Rocks, and something\r\n  more barren tho there was some trees and wood growing in y^e\r\n  Rocks and hanging over all down y^e Brow of some of the hills.\r\n  From these great ffells there are severall springs out of y^e\r\n  Rock that trickle down their sides, and as they meete with stones\r\n  and Rocks in the way, when something obstructs their passage and\r\n  so they Come with more violence, that gives a pleaseing sound\r\n  and murmuring noise.... As I walked down at this place I was\r\n  walled on both sides by those inaccessible high rocky barren\r\n  hills w^{ch} hangs over ones head in some places and appears very\r\n  terrible, and from them springs many Little Currents of water\r\n  from the sides and Clefts, w^{ch} trickle down to some Lower part\r\n  where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way,\r\n  w^{ch} makes a pleasant Rush and murmuring noise.[235]\r\n\r\nWordsworth's \"And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of\r\nwaters,\" has here an interesting early statement. Of Ulswater, she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  I rode the whole Length of this water by its side, sometyme a\r\n  Little higher upon the side of the hill and sometyme just by the\r\n  shore.... I observed the boundaries of all these great waters\r\n  (which are a sort of deep Lakes or kind of standing waters) are\r\n  these sort of Barren Rocky hill w^{ch} are so vastly high. I Call\r\n  this a standing water because its not like other great Rivers as\r\n  y^e Trent, Severne, Hull or Thames, etc. to appear to Run w^{th}\r\n  a streame or Current but only as it Rowles from side to side Like\r\n  waves as the wind moves it.[236]\r\n\r\nAs a rule scenery is but slightly touched upon. Miss Fiennes's\r\ninterest was in roads, bridges, markets, dwellings and grounds,\r\nchurches; in the quality and price of food, in dress, in pictures and\r\nfurniture, in manners and customs; in pageantry, processions, and\r\nceremonials. Her description of the customs at Bath, of the funeral\r\nof Queen Mary, of the Lord Mayor's Day in London, may be taken as\r\nillustrative of her method of writing. Her manuscript was printed\r\n_verbatim_, and that was, indeed, the only course to pursue. Any\r\nattempt to correct or methodize, or modernize it, would result almost\r\nin rewriting it. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, a generation later, was\r\na keen observer of affairs in Turkey, but Miss Fiennes surpasses her\r\nin fullness of detail. Nothing escapes her quick, accurate eye, her\r\nsharply retentive memory, and her unwearied pen. The facts crowd\r\nin upon each other with breathless haste. There is no such thing\r\nas grace or melody or beauty of style. There is hardly anything\r\nso tranquilizing as order and clearness. There is no time for any\r\npersonal reactions on the things seen. There is only here and there a\r\nreflection, there are only the scantiest notes on people. But there\r\nis an astounding assemblage of external facts, undiscriminating,\r\nuninterpreted, unenlivened by a spark of emotion or imagination,\r\nbut, in their total effect, genuinely impressive. What energy, what\r\ncourage, what endurance, it required for a woman to make these\r\nunusual and very difficult journeys! And yet at first reading the\r\ndry, rapid, confused narrative is as uninspiring as a guidebook. It\r\nis only gradually that we become conscious of the burning enthusiasm\r\nthat kept Miss Fiennes at her self-imposed task. She had the zeal\r\nof a devotee with the intellectual method of a chronicler or maker\r\nof inventories. But whatever may be the counts against her style,\r\nthere can be no deductions from the high estimate of her book as a\r\ncontribution to social history. And still more must it stand to her\r\ncredit that not only no other woman, but no man of her day knew so\r\nmuch about England as did this earliest of the women travelers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elizabeth Elstob (1683-1756)]\r\n\r\nA lady who can in the strictest interpretation of the word be called\r\nlearned is Elizabeth Elstob. For this reason and because she is very\r\nlittle known, I shall give as full an account as I have been able\r\nto obtain. In Ballard's _Collection of Original Letters_, in the\r\nBodleian Library are several to him from Miss Elstob, and among them\r\nis the following brief memoir of her life, in her own handwriting,\r\nenclosed in a letter dated November 23, 1738:\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth Elstob, Daughter of Ralph and Jane Elstob,[237] was\r\n  born in the Parish of St. Nicholas, in New Castle upon Tyne,\r\n  September the twenty ninth, sixteen hundred and eighty-three.\r\n  From her childhood she was a great lover of books, which\r\n  being observed by her mother, who was also a great admirer of\r\n  learning, especially in her own sex, there was nothing wanting\r\n  for her improvement, so long as her mother lived. But being\r\n  so unfortunate as to lose her when she was about eight years\r\n  old, and when she had but just gone thro' her accidence and\r\n  grammar, there was a stop put to her progress in learning for\r\n  some years. For her brother being under age when her mother\r\n  died, she was under the guardianship of a relation, who was no\r\n  friend to women's learning, so that she was not suffered to\r\n  proceed, notwithstanding her repeated requests that she might,\r\n  being always put off with that common and vulgar saying that one\r\n  tongue is enough for a woman. However, this discouragement did\r\n  not prevent her earnest endeavours to improve her mind, in the\r\n  best manner she was able, not only because she had a natural\r\n  inclination to books herself, but in obedience to her excellent\r\n  mother's desire. She therefore employed most of her time in\r\n  reading such English and French books (which last language she\r\n  with much difficulty obtained leave to learn) as she could meet\r\n  with till she went to live with her brother, who very joyfully\r\n  and readily assisted and encouraged her, in her studies,\r\n  with whom she laboured very hard as long as she lived. In that\r\n  time she translated and published an Essay on Glory, written in\r\n  French by the celebrated Mademoiselle de Scudery, and published\r\n  an English-Saxon Homily on the Birthday of St. Gregory, with an\r\n  English translation and Notes, etc. Also the Rudiments of Grammar\r\n  for the English-Saxon Tongue. She designed, if ill fortune had\r\n  not prevented her, to have published all Ælfrick's Homilies, of\r\n  which she made an entire transcript, with the various readings\r\n  from other manuscripts, and had translated several of them into\r\n  English. She likewise took an exact copy of the Textus Roffensis\r\n  upon vellum, now in the library of that great and generous\r\n  encourager of learning, the Right Honourable the Earl of Oxford.\r\n  And transcribed all the Hymns, from an ancient Manuscript\r\n  belonging to the Church of Sarum. She had several other designs,\r\n  but was unhappily hindered, by a necessity of getting her bread,\r\n  which with much difficulty, labour, and ill health, she has\r\n  endeavoured to do for many years, with very indifferent success.\r\n  If it had not been that Almighty God was graciously pleased to\r\n  raise her up lately some generous and good friends, she could not\r\n  have subsisted, to whom she always was, and will, by the grace of\r\n  God, be most faithful.[238]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIZABETH ELSTOB\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by herself engraved in an initial for her translation\r\nof _The Pastoral of St. Gregory_, 1709, and used also in her\r\n_Grammar_ in 1713]\r\n\r\nThe brother of whom Miss Elstob speaks was William Elstob, who was\r\nten years older than she. At eleven he was sent to Eton. At sixteen\r\nhe went to Cambridge, and later to Oxford, where he was finally, in\r\n1696, elected fellow of University College. In 1702 he became rector\r\nof the united parishes of St. Swithin and St. Mary Bothaw, in London,\r\nwhere he died in 1715 at the age of forty-two. He was a highly\r\ntrained linguist, a great lover of antiquities, and one of the most\r\npromising Anglo-Saxon scholars of his time. He apparently had liberal\r\nsentiments concerning the education of women, so that as soon as his\r\nsister came under his care all her desires for study were gratified.\r\nJust when she went to Oxford is not certain, but it was probably\r\nabout the time he took his fellowship, when she was thirteen. She\r\ngives the date of her entrance upon her Anglo-Saxon studies as 1698,\r\nwhen she was fifteen. In that year her brother had made a transcript\r\nof King Alfred's version of the Latin historian Orosius which he\r\ndesigned to publish. She wished to understand it and says, \"Having\r\ngained the Alphabet, I found it so easy, and in it so much the\r\ngrounds of our present Language, and of a more particular Agreement\r\nwith some Words which I had heard when very young in the _North_, as\r\ndrew me to be more inquisitive after Books written in that Language.\"\r\nHer brother was well pleased and recommended the _Saxon Heptatuch_.\r\nFrom this she went on to other treatises, and finally began to\r\ndivert herself with taking transcripts of such ancient manuscripts\r\nas she could find.[239] She proved to be particularly facile with\r\nher pen. The copies she made of the old manuscripts were said to be\r\nmarvels in the way of beauty and accuracy of lettering. Her copy of\r\nthe _Textus Roffensis_ is described by Nichols as \"one of the most\r\nlovely specimens of modern Saxon writing that can be imagined.\" She\r\nwas well received in the University, for Mr. Rowe Mores speaks of\r\nher as \"the _indefessa comes_ of her brother's studies, a female\r\nstudent in the University and a favourite of Dr. Hudson and the\r\nOxonians.\"[240] In 1702 she went with her brother to London and they\r\nkept on in their work together with great eagerness and satisfaction.\r\nThere gradually grew up in Miss Elstob's mind a desire to translate\r\nand publish some Anglo-Saxon manuscript. She was encouraged in this\r\nnot only by her brother, but by Dr. Hickes, \"the great patron of\r\nthe Septentrional Studies,\" who said that by publishing somewhat in\r\nSaxon she might invite \"the ladies to be acquainted with the Language\r\nof their Predecessors, and the Original of their Mother Tongue.\"\r\nThe text finally determined upon was the _Homily on the Birthday of\r\nSt. Gregory_. Dr. Hudson, \"a man of so generous a mind as not to\r\ndiscourage learning, even in the female sex,\" gave her access to the\r\nancient parchment Book of Homilies in the Bodleian. The book on St.\r\nGregory appeared in 1709 under the title, _An English-Saxon Homily on\r\nthe Birth-Day of St. Gregory: Anciently used in the English-Saxon\r\nChurch. Giving an Account of the Conversion of the English from\r\nPaganism to Christianity. Translated into Modern English, with\r\nNotes._ It was a stately and dignified volume with a full-page\r\nengraving by Gribelin, and many engraved letters and head and tail\r\npieces. In the capital \"G\" of Gregory was a portrait of Miss Elstob\r\ndone by herself.[241] The Dedication to Queen Anne apologizes for\r\nusing a language so \"out-dated and antiquated,\" a language which \"few\r\nMen and none of the other Sex have ventured to converse with\" since\r\nthe time when it was the current speech. But she adroitly pays the\r\nnecessary compliment and at the same time recommends her theme, by\r\npointing out that Anglo-Saxon was the language in which the Pious\r\nProgenitors of Queen Anne had received the Orthodox Faith of which\r\nthe Queen was the undoubted Defender. The Preface, sixty pages\r\nlong, is a learned account of the introduction of Christianity into\r\nEngland. In the text the Saxon and English are in parallel columns,\r\nand there is a brave apparatus of notes and comments. Following the\r\nEnglish-Saxon Homily is a Latin version by William Elstob which he\r\npresents to his sister with the following Latin letter:\r\n\r\n      _Gulielmus Elistobius\r\n      ELIZABETHÆ\r\n      Sorori suæ carissimæ\r\n      S. D._\r\n\r\n  _Dum tu, soror mea dilectissima, Homiliæ Saxonicæ, de gentis nostræ\r\n  Conversione paras versionem Anglicam fæminis liberalibus: nonnulli\r\n  forte ex amicis nostris, tum Academicis tum aliis, Latinam postulant\r\n  hominibus eruditis. Id te velle accomodare venis ad me dicens, bene\r\n  autem posse negâsti. Verecundius sane id quam verius. Sed favendum\r\n  omnino verecundiæ, præsertim muliebri: maximè autem tuæ, cum in te\r\n  virtus illa sit notissima. Quare, quod poscis, dulcis & indefessa\r\n  studiorum meorum comes, do tibi Latinè. Non Ciceronianè, ut tu velis,\r\n  id est ornatè, at non ineptè tamen: iisdem ferè verbis repositis\r\n  quæ in Saxonica olim tansfusa, vel ex Turonensi Gregorio, vel tuo,\r\n  vel ex Beda nostrate, vel utroque Diacono, & Johanne & Paulo. Eadem\r\n  plane ratione, qua jam pridem Orosium à nobis elucubratum scis, & qua\r\n  Gregorii tui Curam Pastoralem, Deo favente, & adjutrice te, Eruditis\r\n  perlibenter darem. Vale._\r\n\r\n      _Kal. Jun._ MDCCIX.\r\n\r\nThe book was published by subscription and the list of subscribers\r\nis an interesting one. We, of course, find the Anglo-Saxon scholars,\r\nsuch as Mr. Thwaites[242] and Dr. Hickes, various Oxonians, the\r\nElstobs of Canterbury and Durham, and others who were in the same\r\nreligious or learned circles. Various letters to Ralph Thoresby[243]\r\nshow his interest. In March, 1708-09, she sent him the frontispiece\r\nto the _Homily_ saying there would be other ornaments in the way of\r\nborders and letters \"which will make the book somewhat dear, but I\r\nwould willingly have it as beautiful as possible.\" In May, 1709,\r\nshe thanks him for procuring \"so noble a number of encouragers\"\r\nto her work. Nearly half of the two hundred and sixty subscribers\r\nare women. Lady Elizabeth Hastings and Lady Catharine Jones, Mary\r\nAstell's friends, are there; and Lady Winchilsea's friends, the\r\nThynnes, the Worseleys, and the Thanets, but not Mary Astell or Lady\r\nWinchilsea. The literary set--Pope, Swift, Gay, Addison, Steele--is\r\nnot represented. Women of title, clergymen, and scholars make up the\r\nlist.[244]\r\n\r\nThe Preface is of personal as well as learned interest. Miss Elstob\r\ndid not enter upon the career of authorship without an uneasy\r\nrecognition of the opprobrium she might bring upon herself by\r\naspirations so unfeminine. She was, in her own mind, fortified by\r\nthe elegant Latin treatise in which \"Mrs. Anna Maria à Schurman,\r\nthat Glory of her Sex,\" had answered, with due scholastic form and\r\ndignity, the usual objections made by Gentlemen to Women's Learning,\r\nbut in deference to the readers of her _Homily_ she felt the\r\nnecessity of a few words of self justification:\r\n\r\n  For first, I know it will be said, What has a Woman to do with\r\n  Learning? This I have known urged by some Men, with an Envy\r\n  unbecoming that greatness of Soul, which is said to dignify their\r\n  Sex.... Where is the Fault in Womens seeking after Learning? why\r\n  are they not to be valu'd for acquiring to themselves the noblest\r\n  Ornaments? what hurt can this be to themselves? what Disadvantage\r\n  to others? But there are two things usually opposed against\r\n  Womens Learning. That it makes them impertinent, and neglect\r\n  their household Affairs. Where this happens it is a Fault. But\r\n  it is not the Fault of Learning, which rather polishes and\r\n  refines our Nature, and teaches us that Method and Regularity,\r\n  which disposes us to greater Readiness and Dexterity in all\r\n  kinds of Business. I do not observe it so frequently objected\r\n  against Womens Diversions, that They take them off from Household\r\n  Affairs. Why therefore should those few among us, who are Lovers\r\n  of Learning, altho' no better account cou'd be given of it than\r\n  its being a Diversion, be deny'd the Benefit and Pleasure of it,\r\n  which is both so innocent and improving.... I shall not enter\r\n  into any more of the Reasons why some Gentlemen are so eager to\r\n  deny us this privilege: I am more surprised, and even ashamed, to\r\n  find any of the Ladies were more violent than they, in carrying\r\n  on the same charge. Who despairing to arrive at any eminent or\r\n  laudable degree of knowledge, seem totally to abandon themselves\r\n  to Ignorance, contenting themselves to sit down in Darkness, as\r\n  if they either had not Reason, or it were not capable by being\r\n  rightly cultivated, of bringing them into the Light.... Admit\r\n  a Woman may have Learning, is there no other kind of Learning\r\n  to employ her time? What is this Saxon? What has she to do with\r\n  this barbarous antiquated Stuff? so useless, so altogether\r\n  out of the way?... I fear, if things were rightly consider'd,\r\n  that the charge of Barbarity would rather fall upon those who,\r\n  while they fancy themselves adorn'd with the Embellishments\r\n  of foreign Learning, are ignorant, even to barbarity, of the\r\n  Faith, Religion, the Laws and Customs, and Language of their\r\n  Ancestors.[245]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the learning in Miss Elstob's work should\r\nbe thought of by many as in reality the work of her brother. On\r\nthis point, towards the close of the Preface, she comments rather\r\nambiguously as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have been askt the Question, more than once, whether this\r\n  Performance was all my own? How properly such a Question may be\r\n  ask'd by those who know with whom I live, I shall not dispute:\r\n  But since some there are who may have a Curiosity to know the\r\n  same thing, who yet suspect the Decency of such a Question: that\r\n  they may be under no Uneasiness on this account, they may be\r\n  pleas'd to understand that I have a kind Brother, who is always\r\n  ready to assist and encourage me in my Studies. I might say much\r\n  of my Obligations on this account: wou'd he permit me to express\r\n  my self at large on that Subject. But as I think it no shame to\r\n  me to take any Advice where it may be so easily obtain'd: so I\r\n  should think it unpardonable to be guilty of such a Silence, as\r\n  might make me seem averse to all Acknowledgement.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of the _Homily on the Birthday of St.\r\nGregory_ Miss Elstob made a visit to Canterbury where her uncle\r\nwas prebendary. The number of Canterbury names in her list of\r\nsubscribers shows that her fame for learning had preceded her. She\r\nwas very favorably received, especially by some ladies of rank,\r\none of whom expressed a desire to study Anglo-Saxon under her\r\ndirection. In pursuance of this project Miss Elstob began at once\r\non the preparation of an _Anglo-Saxon Grammar_.[246] In 1715, when\r\nthe _Grammar_ finally appeared, Miss Elstob wrote thus in a Preface\r\naddressed to Dr. Hickes:\r\n\r\n  I was more particularly gratified with the new Friendship and\r\n  Conversation, of a young Lady, whose Ingenuity and Love of\r\n  Learning is well known and esteem'd, not only in that Place,\r\n  but by yourself: and which so far indear'd itself to me, by her\r\n  promise that she wou'd learn the _Saxon Tongue_, and do me the\r\n  Honour to be my _Scholar_, as to make me think of composing an\r\n  _English Grammar_ of that Language for her use. That Ladies\r\n  Fortune hath so disposed of her since that time, and hath placed\r\n  her at so great distance, as that we have had no Opportunity,\r\n  of treating farther on this Matter, either by Discourse or\r\n  Correspondence. However, though a Work of a larger Extent, and\r\n  which hath amply experienced your Encouragement, did for some\r\n  time make me lay aside this Design, yet I did not wholly reject\r\n  it.... But considering the Pleasure I my self had reaped from\r\n  the Knowledge I have gained from this Original of our Mother\r\n  Tongue, and that others of my own Sex might be capable of the\r\n  same Satisfaction: I resolv'd to give them the Rudiments of that\r\n  Language in an English Dress.\r\n\r\nThe long Preface to the _Grammar_ is chiefly taken up with an\r\nattack on John Brightland, author of the _Whole System of English\r\nEducation_, and other wise grammarians who had spoken lightly of\r\nAnglo-Saxon and especially of the _Thesaurus_ of Dr. Hickes. One of\r\nthe aspersions cast by the gentlemen on their mother tongue was that\r\nthe Northern Languages \"consist of nothing but _Monosyllables_,\"\r\nand Miss Elstob plunges into a lengthy defense of monosyllables\r\nwith so many quotations from English verse as to show that being\r\n\"mistress of eight foreign languages\" did not prevent her from being\r\nexceedingly well read in the poetical literature of her own tongue.\r\nThis portion of the Preface is followed by a diatribe against those\r\nwho consider the study of antiquities and of the Saxon tongue as\r\nbelonging to a lower order of mind, and not contributing to a \"just\r\nstile\" as do the classics.[247] This topic, also, is illustrated by\r\nliterary characterizations so numerous and apt as to show wide and\r\ndiscriminating reading in English prose.[248]\r\n\r\nMiss Elstob was a redoubtable champion in the cause of Anglo-Saxon\r\nlearning. At the beginning of her career, in 1709, just as her\r\n_Homily on the Birthday of St. Gregory_ was coming from the press,\r\nSwift had spoken of her as one of the Professors in the College of\r\nMadonella, ascribing to her the publication of \"two of the choicest\r\nSaxon novels, which are said to have been in as much repute at Queen\r\nEmma's Court, as the 'Memoires from the New Atalantis' are with those\r\nof ours.\"[249] This disparaging allusion may have predisposed Miss\r\nElstob to answer Swift with exceptional energy when he ranged himself\r\nwith the scorners of Anglo-Saxon learning. In 1737 Mr. Ballard, in\r\nexpressing surprise at the appearance of some new opponent of Saxon,\r\nwrote: \"Indeed I thought that the bad success Dean Swift had met\r\nwith in this affair from the incomparably learned and ingenious Mrs.\r\nElstob, would have deterred all others from once opening their mouths\r\non this head.\"[250]\r\n\r\nThe _Homily_ and the _Grammar_ gave Miss Elstob, at thirty-two,\r\na distinguished place in the world of scholarship. She had also\r\nshown unusual skill with her pencil. Not only were her transcripts\r\nof manuscripts noted for their beauty, but she also drew admirable\r\nportraits. In 1737 Mr. Ballard wrote Mr. Joseph Ames:\r\n\r\n  I design, if possible, to make a tour to London this Winter, just\r\n  to peep upon a few choice friends, and will bring Miss Elstob's\r\n  Life of her Brother along with me, to pleasure you with. But you\r\n  must be silent in the affair, for some particular reasons not\r\n  proper here to be mentioned. Besides the above mentioned _Life_,\r\n  I have a dozen pieces of this fine accomplished gentlewoman's\r\n  drawings, amongst which are pictures of herself, Dr. Hickes, Mr.\r\n  Dryden, and Johannes Ogilvius, etc. very masterly done, and, as I\r\n  am told, very extraordinary true likenesses.[251]\r\n\r\nWe get no further completed work from Miss Elstob after the _Grammar_\r\nof 1715, but the six years between the _Homily_ and the _Grammar_\r\nwere rich in study and plans. In February, 1708-09, Mr. Thoresby\r\nwrote to Dr. Richardson:\r\n\r\n  Amongst the Authors, I might have mentioned some of the female\r\n  sex; as the Bishop of Sarum's lady, and Miss Elstob; the former\r\n  has writ a Method of Devotion, the latter translated a piece of\r\n  Mons. Scudery from the French, and added some of her own: and is\r\n  for giving us a more correct Edition of Sir John Spelman's Saxon\r\n  Psalms, in which tongue she is a great proficient, and has writ\r\n  that in my Album, etc.[252]\r\n\r\nThe \"work of larger extent\" for which Miss Elstob temporarily\r\nset aside her _Grammar_ was the proposed publication of a Saxon\r\nHomilarium with English translations and notes. That this Homilarium,\r\nwhich was to have been her great work, was well under way by 1712 is\r\nindicated by the following letter, December 23, 1712, from Dr. Hickes\r\nto Dr. Charlett:\r\n\r\n  I suppose you may have seen Miss Elstob, sister to Mr. Elstob,\r\n  formerly fellow of your Coll. and the MSS. she hath brought\r\n  to be printed at your press. The University hath acquired\r\n  much reputation and honour at home and abroad, by the Saxon\r\n  books printed there, as well as by those printed in Latin and\r\n  Greek, and the publication of the MSS. she hath brought (the\r\n  most correct I ever saw or read) will be of great advantage to\r\n  the Church of England against the Papists; for the honour of\r\n  our Predecessors the English Saxon Clergy, especially of the\r\n  Episcopal Order, and the credit of our country to which Miss\r\n  Elstob will be counted abroad as great an ornament in her way,\r\n  as Madam Dacier is to France. I do not desire you to give her\r\n  all encouragement, because I believe you will do it of your own\r\n  accord from your natural temper to promote good and great works.\r\n  But I desire you to recommend her, and her great undertaking to\r\n  others, for she and it are both very worthy to be encouraged, and\r\n  were I at Oxford, I should be a great solicitor for her. And had\r\n  I acquaintance enough with Mr. Vice-Chancellor I had troubled him\r\n  with a letter in her behalf. I will add no more but to tell you\r\n  that the news of Miss Elstob's encouragement at the University\r\n  will be very acceptable to me, because it will give her work\r\n  credit here, where it shall be promoted to the utmost power\r\n  by your Philo-Sax. and Philo-Goth. and most faithful, humble\r\n  Servt.[253]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1713, Bedford wrote to Mr. Hearne: \"I am to desire y^o\r\nfrom him to give all y^e assistance & encouragement y^o can to Mrs.\r\nElstob's work, who is now going down to y^e University again ab^t\r\nit.\"[254] Mr. Hearne responded in March: \"I wish Mrs. Elstob good\r\nsuccess. Tho' if she meet with no better Encouragement here than I\r\nhave done as yet 't will not be great.\"[255]\r\n\r\nIn the same year Mr. Bowyer printed \"Some Testimonies of Learned Men\r\nin favour of the intended edition of the _Saxon_ Homilies, concerning\r\nthe learning of the author of those Homilies, and the advantages to\r\nbe hoped from an edition of them.\"[256] And three letters from Miss\r\nElstob to the Lord Treasurer show that he solicited and obtained the\r\nQueen's Bounty towards printing the _Homilies_.[257]\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this encouragement the publication of the\r\n_Homilies_ hung fire for many months. It is possible that the\r\ndeath of Mr. Elstob and of Dr. Hickes in 1715 delayed matters by\r\ndepriving Miss Elstob of able advocates and counselors. In July,\r\n1716, Sir P. Sydenham indicates his concern that the book had not\r\nyet appeared.[258] In November of that year Mr. T. Baker writes\r\napologetically to Mr. Hearne that he is \"deep in M^{rs}. Elstob and\r\nMr. Strype,\" and that the work does not admit of haste.[259] Later in\r\nthe same month Mr. Hearne gives the cheering news that \"Mrs. Elstob's\r\nbook is going on at last.\"[260] But only five of the _Homilies_ were\r\nactually printed off at Oxford.[261] The great scheme failed for want\r\nof money. Miss Elstob's own fortune was apparently involved, for in\r\n1718 Mr. T. Baker wrote to Hearne that Miss Elstob was \"lately gone\r\noff for debt.\"[262]\r\n\r\nExcept these few facts concerning the _Homilies_ very few details are\r\nknown concerning Miss Elstob's life after 1715. Bishop Smalridge[263]\r\naided her for a time, but she could not endure the thought of\r\nbeing a burden on her friends, and she finally went to Evesham,\r\nWorcestershire, where she started a little school. Mr. Tindale,\r\nin his _History of Evesham_, says that he was credibly informed\r\nthat her weekly stipend in this school was at first but a groat a\r\nweek. She was in this very contracted and difficult way of life for\r\nnearly twenty years. When relief came it was as the result of the\r\nefforts of an obscure young Anglo-Saxon scholar, Mr. George Ballard,\r\na lady's-stay-maker, who became acquainted with Miss Elstob and\r\ndescribed her situation so effectively to one of his customers, a\r\nMrs. Chapone, that this lady wrote a circular letter representing\r\nMiss Elstob's extensive learning, her service to literature, her\r\nmultiplied distresses, her meekness and patience, and sent it to\r\nthe neighboring gentry. An annuity of twenty guineas was raised,\r\nand Miss Elstob was enabled to keep an assistant so that she could\r\nagain \"taste of that food of the mind from which she had been so long\r\noblig'd to fast.\"\r\n\r\nAnother result of Mrs. Chapone's letter was a possible appointment\r\nfor Miss Elstob as mistress of a charity school kept up by Lady\r\nElizabeth Hastings. With regard to this plan Miss Elstob wrote the\r\nfollowing very interesting letter to Mr. George Ballard:\r\n\r\n  Since you desire to know if I have accepted Mrs. Capon's\r\n  proposal, I do, though I am very sensible it is not commendable\r\n  to expose a private correspondence, venture to communicate to\r\n  so good a friend, a copy of the worthy gentleman's letter, sent\r\n  her in answer to her vastly kind recommendation of me, and the\r\n  charming letter she sent to me. In answer to hers, after I had\r\n  received your answer, I assured her of my readiness to serve that\r\n  excellent lady, as far as lyes in my power. But there are some\r\n  things to be taught in such a school, which I cannot pretend to:\r\n  I mean, the two accomplishments of a good housewife, spinning\r\n  and knitting. Not that I would be thought to be above doing any\r\n  commendable work proper for my sex; for I have continually in my\r\n  thoughts the glorious character of a virtuous woman, Proverbs\r\n  XXXI, 13; \"She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with\r\n  her hands.\" And as an instance of the truth of this, the gown\r\n  I had on when you gave me the favour of a visit was part of it\r\n  my own spinning, and I wear no other stockings but what I knit\r\n  myself: yet I do not think myself proficient enough in these arts\r\n  to become a teacher of them. As to your objection on the meanness\r\n  of the scholars, I assure you, Sir, I should think it as glorious\r\n  an employment to instruct those poor children, as to teach the\r\n  children of the greatest. But I must tell you that mine may be\r\n  termed a life of disappointments from my cradle till now, nor\r\n  do I expect any other while I live. This, and hearing no more\r\n  of that affair, makes me think her ladyship is provided with a\r\n  mistress before now, there being many more deserving than myself,\r\n  that are in want of such an employment. Nor do I repine; for I am\r\n  so inured to disappointments, that I expect nothing else, and I\r\n  receive them with as much easiness as others do their greatest\r\n  prosperity.... I often compare myself to poor John Tucker, whose\r\n  Life I read when a girl in Winstanley's Lives of the Poets, which\r\n  affected me so much that I cannot forget it yet. He is there\r\n  described to have been an honest, industrious, poor man, but,\r\n  notwithstanding his indefatigable industry, as the author writes,\r\n  \"no butter would stick on his bread.\"[264]\r\n\r\nThe Mrs. Chapone who wrote the circular letter concerning Miss Elstob\r\nwas Sarah Kirkham, an intimate girlhood friend of Mary Granville,\r\nafterward Mrs. Pendarves, but better known as Mrs. Delany. Sally\r\nKirkham is described by Mrs. Delany as a girl of \"extraordinary\r\nunderstanding, lively imagination, and humane disposition,\" of\r\n\"uncommon genius and intrepid spirit.\" In 1725, at the age of\r\ntwenty-four she married the Reverend John Chapone, and they went to\r\nlive in Stanton, Gloucestershire, and little more is heard of her\r\nuntil the writing of this letter before 1734. Mrs. Chapone meant the\r\nletter for the neighboring gentry, but it finally reached a more\r\ndistinguished audience. Mrs. Pendarves writes:\r\n\r\n  I told you in my last I had left Sally's letter with Mrs. Pointz.\r\n  She gave it to her husband, who desired the Duke to read it to\r\n  the Queen. The Queen was so touched with the letter that she\r\n  immediately sent for Mrs. Pointz, to inquire into some more\r\n  particulars about the person mentioned in it, _and the person\r\n  who wrote it_. Mrs. Pointz said she knew no more than what the\r\n  letter told, but that Mrs. Chapone was a friend of ours. The\r\n  Queen said she never in her life read a better letter, that it\r\n  had touched her heart, and ordered immediately an hundred pounds\r\n  for Mrs. Elstob, and said she \"need never fear a necessitous\r\n  old age whilst she lived, and that when she wanted more to ask\r\n  for it, and she should have it.\" I think this was acting like a\r\n  queen, and ought to be known.... I hope this may be the means of\r\n  serving our friend Sally, the letter was the whole discourse of\r\n  the drawing-room. The Queen asked the Duke \"When he should be\r\n  able to write such a letter.\" He answered, honestly, \"Never.\"\r\n  Mrs. Pointz has asked many particulars about Mr. Chapone, and I\r\n  did him justice.[265]\r\n\r\nQueen Caroline's interest was so genuinely aroused that she not only\r\nordered the £100 to be at once sent to Miss Elstob, but promised to\r\nrepeat the same every five years. This was evidently with the idea\r\nthat she should be taken from the little school at Evesham and put\r\ninto her proper station as \"mistress of a boarding-school for young\r\nladies of a higher rank.\" Such might have been the outcome had not\r\nthe money lapsed with the death of the Queen in 1737.\r\n\r\nAll plans for Miss Elstob seemed to end in failure till \"Sally's\r\nhistorical epistle,\" as Mrs. Pendarves called it, was sent to the\r\nDuchess of Portland at Bulstrode.[266] The result in this case was\r\nof permanent value, for Miss Elstob was invited by the Duchess to\r\nmake her home at Bulstrode as instructor of the children. Of this\r\nappointment Mrs. Pendarves wrote, December 12, 1738, to her mother:\r\n\r\n  The Duchess has now a thousand fears, lest my Lord and Lady\r\n  Oxford should have any objections against taking her, but I\r\n  hope they will all prove false.... Mrs. Elstob seems, out of\r\n  modesty and diffidence of herself, to decline coming, but it\r\n  would be most imprudent of her to decline such an offer, when no\r\n  fatigue will be imposed upon her, but all imaginable care will\r\n  be taken of her. I own I long to have _you see her_, that I may\r\n  really know what sort of woman she is. My Lord Oxford objects\r\n  to her not speaking French, but the Duchess answers she shall\r\n  have a master for that, or a maid to talk, and all she requires\r\n  and hopes of Mrs. Elstob is to instruct her children in the\r\n  principles of religion and virtue, to teach them to speak, read,\r\n  and understand English well, to cultivate their minds as far as\r\n  their capacity will allow, and to keep them company in the house\r\n  and when her health and strength will permit to take the air with\r\n  them. All this she is surely well qualified to do, and it would\r\n  be a sincere joy to me to have our worthy Duchess possest of so\r\n  valuable a person.[267]\r\n\r\nTen days later Mrs. Pendarves wrote again from Bulstrode:\r\n\r\n  The Elstobian matter is _quite fixed_, and she expressed the\r\n  utmost satisfaction at having secured such a worthy woman to\r\n  educate her children; I wrote last post to Mrs. Elstob to tell\r\n  her that the Duchess looked on her as engaged to her, and that\r\n  her salary should begin on Xmas Day next, though she could not\r\n  conveniently take her into her family till Midsummer. I hope\r\n  she will write to the Duchess, and suppose she will of course;\r\n  I gave her a little hint but would not have it mentioned that\r\n  I did.... I think your advice to Mrs. Elstob quite right about\r\n  _paying debts_; a person of such principles as hers cannot enjoy\r\n  any advantages without doing that justice when it is in her power\r\n  to do it.[268]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1739, Miss Elstob was in Evesham and several times met her\r\nbenefactor, Mrs. Chapone, of whom she gives a lively picture showing\r\nthat letter-writing was not Mrs. Chapone's only title to fame. Miss\r\nElstob writes:\r\n\r\n  The last time she was here, I had an exceeding pleasure,\r\n  though not without some concern, at hearing a long and _warm_\r\n  dispute between that charming woman, and Mr. Ben Seward, on\r\n  some methodistical notions, in which it was by better judges\r\n  than myself agreed that the _female_ antagonist had _much the\r\n  advantage over him_.[269]\r\n\r\nMiss Elstob spent the remaining seventeen years of her life with\r\nthe Duchess of Portland. They were comfortable, leisurely, studious\r\nyears, a delightful haven after her twenty years of hardship, penury,\r\nand intellectual starvation. But she was fifty-six when she went to\r\nBulstrode, and the ease and security of her life there came too late\r\nto rouse into life the mental activity so long dormant. Miss Elstob's\r\nreal life was the twenty years with her brother, years of plain\r\nliving and high aspirations while they worked together in the realms\r\nof pure scholarship. It would be difficult to find a more satisfying\r\nexample of literary comradeship than that offered by the learned\r\nyoung curate and the learned young sister, the \"_dulcis & indefessa\r\ncomes_\" of his studies.[270]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elizabeth Blackwell (fl. 1739)]\r\n\r\nIn 1739 Mrs. Elizabeth Blackwell published in two folio volumes _A\r\nCurious Herbal, containing Five Hundred Cuts, of the most useful\r\nPlants, which are now used in the Practice of Physick, engraved\r\non folio Copper Plates, after Drawings taken from the Life, by\r\nElizabeth Blackwell. To which is added, a short Description of the\r\nPlants and their common Uses in Physick. Printed for John Nourse at\r\nthe Lamb without Temple Bar._ The first of these magnificent volumes\r\nis dedicated to the famous Dr. Richard Mead, \"Physician to Kings,\" as\r\nthe one who first advised the publication of the work. The dedication\r\nof the second volume is to Isaac Rand, an apothecary and Fellow of\r\nthe Royal Society, and Curator of the Botanical Garden at Chelsea, as\r\nthe one to whom she went for assistance in all difficult botanical\r\nquestions. The short descriptions of the plants were taken mainly\r\nfrom Mr. Joseph Miller's _Botanicum Officinale_ with his consent. She\r\nlived near the Botanical Garden and made all her drawings from life.\r\nShe also etched them on copper, and colored them herself. The book\r\nreceived high recognition. Much of the work must have been done by\r\n1735, for on October 1 of that year the following testimonial, now\r\none of the title-pages, was written:\r\n\r\n  We whose names are underwritten, having seen a considerable\r\n  Number of the Drawings from which the Plates are to be engraved,\r\n  and likewise some of the Coloured Plants, think it a Justice done\r\n  the Publick to declare our Satisfaction with them, and our good\r\n  Opinion of the Capacity of the Undertaker.\r\n\r\n  R. Mead, M.D.\r\n  G. L. Tessier, M.D.\r\n  Alexander Stuart, M.D.\r\n  Ia. Douglas, M.D.\r\n  James Sherard, M.D.\r\n  W. Cheseldon\r\n  Joseph Miller\r\n  Isaac Rand\r\n  Rob. Nicholls\r\n\r\nThis statement was repeated in French and the names again signed.\r\n\r\nA further endorsement on the completion of the book was dated July 1,\r\n1737. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Imagines hasce Plantarum Officinalium per Dominam Elizabetham\r\n  Blackwell delineatas ceri incisas & depictas, iis qui Medicinæ\r\n  Operam dant, perutiles fore judicamus._\r\n\r\n  Thomas Pellet, Præs.\r\n\r\n  Henricus Plumptre }\r\n  Richardus Tyson   } _Censores_.\r\n  Peircuis Dod      }\r\n  Gulienius Wasey   }\r\n\r\nIn 1757-73 there was a fine republication of the work in Nuremberg\r\nwith an addition of a hundred plants, and a highly laudatory Preface.\r\nThe work was recognized at once as of great practical value because\r\nof the accuracy of the drawings and the large number of plants\r\nrepresented. The charm of the plates is beyond question so far as\r\ndelicacy of outline and beauty of coloring are concerned. They are\r\nsuperior to the plates in Darwin's _Botanic Garden_, nearly half a\r\ncentury later. The Blackwellia race of plants was named after Mrs.\r\nBlackwell in recognition of her admirable work.[271]\r\n\r\nMrs. Blackwell is herself an enigma. She emerges into public\r\nnotice for three years, but her life before and after sinks into\r\nobscurity. She was said to be \"a virtuous gentlewoman, daughter of\r\na worthy merchant,\" who gave her a handsome portion. Her husband\r\nwas Alexander Blackwell, a printer. He was a well-educated and able\r\nman, but generally counted an adventurer. He at one time entered\r\nupon a project of conducting a printing establishment of his own.\r\nHis failure in this landed him in a debtor's prison where he was\r\nconfined several years. Mrs. Blackwell's _Herbal_ was made by her for\r\nthe purpose of securing his release. He is said to have aided her in\r\nthe foreign terminology and in the abridgments from Miller. When he\r\nwas free her object was accomplished and we hear of no further work.\r\nIt would be interesting to know how she came to have so much skill.\r\nIt would be more interesting to know the psychology of her prompt\r\nabandonment of work by which she won both fame and money, and in\r\nwhich she took such evident delight.[272]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Elizabeth Cooper (fl. 1735-40)]\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that so few facts are accessible concerning\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cooper. Her works seem to offer interesting points\r\nof departure for investigation into her life and education, but\r\nwe know little about her except that her literary ventures belong\r\nbetween 1735 and 1740. She was the wife of Thomas Cooper,[273] who\r\nwas either an auctioneer or a book-seller, or possibly both, and she\r\nwas married before 1735. Beyond these meager facts our knowledge of\r\nher must be gleaned from her books. Apparently her first literary\r\nventure was a comedy. It was entitled _The Rival Widows; or, the Fair\r\nLibertine_, and was brought out at the Covent Garden Theater in 1735.\r\nIt had a successful run of nine nights. Baker says that \"allowing for\r\nthe too common freedom of female dramatists, this is far from a bad\r\ncomedy.\"[274] Genest, after briefly outlining the play and commenting\r\non various passages that seem to him borrowed from preceding\r\ndramatists, says: \"It is on the whole a tolerable play, but it wants\r\nincident sadly.\" But he does not agree with Baker as to the moral\r\ntone of the play, for he says of Lady Bellair, the heroine, \"Lady\r\nBellair is gay and extravagant, but of good principles at bottom ...\r\nit is with much impropriety that she is called a Fair Libertine--she\r\nis only above vulgar prejudices.\"[275] In her preface to the play\r\nMrs. Cooper says that it was designed \"an Offering to the Sex\" in\r\nthat the chief character is a woman \"capable of thinking for herself,\r\nand acting on the principles of Nature and Truth.\" Some indications\r\nof the characteristics of Lady Bellair may be found in the fact that\r\nMrs. Horton was chosen to create the part. Millamant in Congreve's\r\n_Way of the World_, Lady Dainty in Burnaby's _The Reform'd Wife_,\r\nLady Betty Modish in Cibber's _Careless Husband_, and Lady Townly in\r\nhis _Provoked Husband_, were the parts in which Mrs. Horton's beauty\r\nand her elegance of dress and manner found their fitting opportunity.\r\nLady Bellair belongs evidently to this class of fine lady coquettes,\r\nand a further point of interest concerning Mrs. Cooper is that on her\r\nbenefit night she herself played the part of Lady Bellair. Either\r\nMrs. Cooper had already shown enough ability as an amateur actress to\r\nwarrant her appearance on the stage of one of the leading theaters,\r\nor she was well enough known as a writer or as a personality to make\r\nher presence in the cast a drawing card. That she could venture\r\non the inevitable comparison with Mrs. Horton may indicate some\r\npossibilities in the way of her own attractive qualities. And it is\r\nto be further noted that she \"unexpectedly and surprizingly\" eclipsed\r\nMrs. Horton. The _Prompter_ endeavors to explain Mrs. Cooper's\r\nsuccess by saying that she \"looked\" the character and represented\r\nwith great \"naturalnes,\" the somewhat bold and libertine heroine.[276]\r\n\r\nMrs. Cooper's second dramatic attempt was a tragedy which was not\r\nsuccessful. It was acted but one night and was never printed.\r\n\r\nThis theatrical work was, however, only on the fringe of Mrs.\r\nCooper's real interest. In 1737 she published a book entitled _The\r\nMuses Library; Or, a Series of English Poetry, from the Saxons, to\r\nthe Reign of King Charles II containing, The Lives and Characters of\r\nall the known Writers in that Interval, the names of their Patrons;\r\nComplete Episodes, by way of Specimen of the larger Pieces, very\r\nnear the intire works of some, and large Quotations from others.\r\nBeing a General Collection of almost all the old valuable Poetry\r\nextant, now so industriously enquir'd after, tho' rarely to be found,\r\nbut in the Studies of the Curious, and affording Entertainment\r\non all Subjects, Philosophical, Historical, Moral, Satyrical,\r\nAllegorical, Critical, Heroick, Pastoral, Gallant, Amorous, Courtly\r\nand Sublime._ But one volume of this projected work was published.\r\nThe early Georgian public was not trained to an interest in the\r\npast. Mrs. Cooper suffered the not infrequent fate of pioneers.\r\nThere was even difficulty in working off one edition of the first\r\nvolume, as is evident from its appearance in 1738 and 1741 with\r\nchanged title-pages.[277] That Mrs. Cooper expected to publish the\r\nsecond volume, including the poets from Samuel Daniel to the time of\r\nCharles II, is shown not only by the statement in her Preface, but\r\nby interesting notes in the _Diary of William Oldys_ (1696-1761),\r\nthe famous antiquary. In 1736 he was in London employed in seeing\r\nthrough the press a new edition of Raleigh's _History of the World_.\r\nHis Chambers were in Gray's Inn and he was frequently consulted\r\nthere \"on obscure and obsolete writers by eminent men of letters.\"\r\nTwo of the people in whom he was particularly interested were Thomas\r\nHayward, who was compiling his _British Muse_, and Mrs. Cooper. In\r\nhis _Diary_ are the following records:\r\n\r\n  1737, June 22. Mrs. Cooper came to my chambers: said she would\r\n  return Puttenham's _Art of Poesy_, Browne's _Pastorals_, and Sir\r\n  Henry Wotton, when she had finished her extracts for the second\r\n  volume of her _Muses' Library_ to be published by Christmas.\r\n\r\n  July 4, Monday. Returned Sir T. More's works: some of his English\r\n  poetry therein might be for Mrs. Cooper's work, or Mr. Haywards,\r\n  on Fortune, etc.\r\n\r\n  Aug. 13. Rec'd letter from Mrs. Cooper to borrow old Marlowe's\r\n  poem of _Hero and Leander_ for the continuation of her _Muses'\r\n  Library_; sent by the servant a very scarce collection of old\r\n  poetry, called _The Paradise of Dainty Devices_, in which are\r\n  several pieces by the old Lord Vaux in King Henry the Eighth's\r\n  time, the Earl of Oxford, Sir W. Raleigh, Mr. Edwards, Jasper\r\n  Haywood, Hunis, Churchyard, Kinwelmarsh, Lloyd, Whetstone, etc.,\r\n  printed 4^o. 1578. To borrow one of Caxton's books of Sir Hans\r\n  Sloane and remember to apply the story of Absyrtus in the preface\r\n  for Mr. Hayward's Collection of select thoughts from our old\r\n  poets.[278]\r\n\r\nMrs. Cooper frequently comments on the difficulty and expense of\r\ngathering material for her enterprise and gratefully acknowledges\r\n\"the generous Assistance of the Candid Mr. Oldys.\" Biographical data\r\nwere also obtained only through most patient effort. The only _Lives\r\nof the Poets_ to which she could have access were Wood's _Athenæ\r\nOxoniensis_ and the works of Phillips, Winstanley, and Jacob. Edward\r\nPhillips's _Theatrum Poetarum_ appeared in 1675. Its first volume\r\ngave brief biographical and critical notes on sixty-four authors from\r\nRobert of Gloucester to George Chapman, thus covering about the same\r\nground as Mrs. Cooper's first volume which closes with Samuel Daniel.\r\nWilliam Winstanley's _Lives of the English Poets_ was published\r\nin 1687. It includes notes on poets from William the Conqueror to\r\nJames II with occasional brief illustrative extracts. _The Poetical\r\nRegister_ of Giles Jacob (1724) is, in the first volume, confined to\r\ndramatists and is based on Langbain. The second volume, _The Lives\r\nand Characters of the English Poets_, extends about a century and a\r\nquarter later than Mrs. Cooper's volume. In the period before 1600\r\nabout half the names in her volume are included and briefly commented\r\non. Jacob also gives an occasional extract.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cooper was not, then, without predecessors in her undertaking.\r\nThe novelty in her book was her assumption that people would not\r\nonly like to know about the old poets, but that there would be\r\nmany lovers of literature who would rejoice in reading the old\r\npoems, and very nearly in their original antiquated form. She gives\r\nten pages from Langland, eleven from Barclay, twenty-eight from\r\nSackville, twenty-four from Churchyard, thirty-five from Fulke\r\nGreville, thirty-one from Fairfax, and so on. Chaucer, Spenser, and\r\nShakespeare are less fully represented, as being already well known.\r\nThe selections are the result of wide reading and are made because\r\nthey pleased Mrs. Cooper's own taste. \"What has given me Pleasure in\r\nmy Closet,\" she says, \"I have undertaken to recommend to the Publick;\r\nnot presuming to inform the Judgment, but only awaken the Attention.\"\r\nThat she failed to \"awaken Attention\" was the fault of the age. Her\r\nselections were representative and interesting.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cooper's book shows not only wide research and a full knowledge\r\nof extant criticism, but it also manifests a personal zest in reading\r\nand an unusual independence of literary judgment. This independence\r\nis shown in her choice of authors. Phillips, Winstanley, and Jacob\r\nhad omitted Langland, but she says, \"In my Judgment, no Writer,\r\nexcept _Chaucer_, and _Spenser_, for many Ages, had more of real\r\nInspiration.\" Or take the case of Lydgate. Phillips mentions him, but\r\nnot, apparently, from any personal knowledge of his work. Winstanley\r\nand Jacob praise him highly. Mrs. Cooper says of him: \"Many Authors\r\nare so profuse in his Praise as to rank him very little below his\r\nMaster, and, often, quote them together; which rais'd my Curiosity so\r\nhigh, that I gave a considerable Price for his Works, and waded thro'\r\na large Folio, hoping still to have my Expectation gratified....\r\nBut I must, either confess my own want of Penetration, or beg leave\r\nto dissent from his Admirers.\" She gives a long quotation from\r\nLord Brook's _A Treatise of Humane Learning_, because his name has\r\n\"never yet received the Honours it deserved.\" She is indignant at\r\nthe general indifference to the work and fame of Edward Fairfax and\r\nwrites a eulogy of several pages. Her comments on Chaucer, Spenser,\r\nand Shakespeare are brief, since all agree on their preëminence.\r\nMr. Lounsbury, after noting one or two errors in the book, says of\r\nit: \"I know of no similar work produced at that period in which the\r\nknowledge displayed is so accurate and comprehensive, or the critical\r\nestimates so uniformly good and just. There was exhibited in it\r\nnot merely freshness of judgment but the independence that springs\r\nfrom the study of writers at first hand.\"[279] Mrs. Cooper had in\r\nher the making of a scholar. She allowed herself no generalities.\r\nWhatever she said was based on a thorough study of the material under\r\ndiscussion. Furthermore, she acquainted herself with all extant\r\ncritical opinion without thereby losing the power to form an opinion\r\nof her own.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cooper's Preface is an excellent, even an eloquent, piece\r\nof writing, in justification of poets as a nation's glory. She\r\nrecognizes that \"Merit is not its own Preservative\" and wishes in\r\nher book to set up if possible \"a Bulwark which shall preserve Merit\r\nfrom the attacks of Time.\" She considers her \"SERIES OF POETRY (which\r\nhas never been aim'd at anywhere else) ... one of the most valuable\r\ncollections that ever was made publick.\" She has no apologies to\r\nmake. In introducing to the moderns this august company of ancient\r\npoets she is saved from any possible self-consciousness by the\r\ndignity of her enterprise. The same tone pervades her Dedication. No\r\nsingle name is glorious enough to appear at the head of her list.\r\nShe chooses rather a dedication to \"the truly Honourable Society for\r\nthe Encouragement of Learning.\"[280] That Society was then in the\r\nhey-day of its brief glory. Mrs. Cooper had, apparently, no thought\r\nof personally benefiting by her Dedications. On the contrary she\r\ncounted this an opportunity to express what all authors and lovers\r\nof literature must feel towards a design \"so great, seasonable, and\r\nhumane\" as that of this new organization, a design applauded by \"all\r\nwho have Generosity, Benevolence or Politeness.\"\r\n\r\nAs dramatist and actress Mrs. Cooper would deserve at least passing\r\nmention, but as a scholar, as an ardent advocate of early English\r\npoetry, she must take high rank, not only among the learned women,\r\nbut also among the learned men of her day.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762)]\r\n\r\nNo woman of the first half of the eighteenth century had a more\r\nactive mind or facile pen than Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Although\r\nalmost none of her work appeared in print in her lifetime, her\r\npersonality made its own way, and she was early recognized as of note\r\nfor genius and learned acquirements. It is, therefore, of especial\r\ninterest to inquire into the particulars of her education, and to\r\nfind out her status as a woman of letters.\r\n\r\nThe materials for such an inquiry are fairly abundant, and are\r\nmainly: her miscellaneous letters, first published in 1803; a\r\nfragmentary autobiographical romance, of which she says \"not a\r\nsillable\" except the names is feigned; and the _Introductory\r\nAnecdotes_ by her granddaughter, Lady Louisa Stuart,[281] included\r\nin Lady Mary's _Letters and Works_ brought out by Lord Wharncliffe,\r\nher great-grandson, in 1887. The important groups of letters\r\ncontaining personal details are those written to Mr. Montagu from\r\nabout 1709 till their marriage in 1712, and the very large group to\r\nher family and friends, chiefly to Lady Bute, her daughter, during\r\nLady Mary's stay in Italy from 1739 to 1761.\r\n\r\nLady Mary's mother died when she was eight, and her father, too much\r\na man of pleasure to trouble himself with the education of girls,\r\ngave his three young daughters into the care of \"an old governess,\r\nwho, though perfectly good and pious, wanted a capacity for so great\r\na trust.\"[282] In commenting on the evil effects of an ignorant\r\neducation, Lady Mary said: \"My own was the worst in the world, being\r\nexactly the same as Clarissa Harlowe's; her pious Mrs. Norton so\r\nperfectly resembling my governess, who had been nurse to my mother.\r\nI could almost fancy the author was acquainted with her. She took so\r\nmuch pains from my infancy, to fill my head with superstitious tales\r\nand false notions, it was none of her fault I am not at this day\r\nafraid of witches and hobgoblins, or turned methodist.\"[283] But at\r\nleast there were no hindering home influences, and Lady Mary had what\r\nCharles Lamb would call the luck to be \"tumbled early into a closet\r\nof good old English books.\" Forsaking the dolls of her sisters she\r\ntook refuge in her father's fine library and there she read with the\r\nabsorption of a youthful Coleridge. She \"got by heart all the poetry\r\nthat came in her way,\" and she \"read every romance as yet invented.\"\r\nLady Louisa says she \"possessed and left after her, the whole library\r\nof Mrs. Lenox's Female Quixote--Cleopatra, Cassandra, Clelia, Cyrus,\r\nPharamond, Ibrahim, etc., etc.--all, like the lady Arabella's\r\ncollection, '_Englished_,' mostly, '_by persons of honour_.' The\r\nchief favourite appeared to have been a translation of Monsieur\r\nHonoré d'Urfé's Astrea, once the delight of Henri Quatre and his\r\ncourt, and still admired and quoted by the _savans_ who flourished\r\nunder Louis XIV. In a blank page of this massive volume (which might\r\nhave counterbalanced a pig of lead of the same size) Lady Mary had\r\nwritten in her fairest youthful hand the names and characteristic\r\nqualities of the chief personages thus:--the beautiful Diana, the\r\nvolatile Climene, the melancholy Doris, Celedon the faithful, Adamas\r\nthe wise, and so on; forming two long columns.\"[284] Among Lady\r\nMary's earliest attempts at authorship were romantic stories in\r\nimitation of these her favorite authors.\r\n\r\nBut along with her romances, and soon superseding them, were sterner\r\nstudies. She early began to teach herself Latin. In her account of\r\nherself under the name Lætitia, she said:\r\n\r\n  Her appetite for knowledge increasing with her years, without\r\n  considering the toilsome task she undertook, she began to learn\r\n  herself the Latin grammar, and with the help of an uncommon\r\n  memory and indefatigable labour, made herself so far mistress\r\n  of that language as to be able to understand almost any author.\r\n  This extraordinary attachment to study became the theme of public\r\n  discourse. Her Father, though no scholar himself, was flattered\r\n  with a pleasure in the progress she made, and this reputation\r\n  which she did not seek (having no end in view but her own\r\n  amusement) gave her enviers and consequently enemies among the\r\n  girls of her own age.\r\n\r\nLady Mary was but fourteen when her \"just and knowing\" criticism of\r\na play, her knowledge of Latin, and her relish for the classics,\r\nexcited the wonder and admiration of Mr. Wortley Montagu. He was as\r\namazed \"as if he had heard a piece of wax work talk.\"[285] But the\r\nenvy of her girl companions and the liberal praise of Mr. Wortley\r\nare not the only proofs that Lady Mary's shining talents and learned\r\ntastes met early recognition. Her uncle, Mr. William Fielding,\r\n\"perceived her capacity, corresponded with her, and encouraged her\r\npursuit of information.\" Bishop Burnet showed himself most friendly,\r\nand condescended to direct her studies. Mr. Wortley also kept up a\r\nkind of scholarly guidance. Lady Mary said to Spence in Rome in 1741:\r\n\"When I was young I was a great admirer of Ovid's Metamorphoses, and\r\nthat was one of the chief reasons that set me upon the thoughts of\r\nstealing the Latin language. Mr. Wortley was the only person to whom\r\nI communicated my design, and he encouraged me in it. I used to study\r\nfive or six hours a day for two years in my father's library; and\r\nso got that language, whilst everybody else thought I was reading\r\nnothing but novels and romances.\"[286] By the time she was twenty\r\nItalian had been added to her accomplishments. In an early undated\r\nletter to Mrs. Hewet she wrote: \"I have begun to learn Italian, and\r\nam much mortified I cannot do it of a signor of Monsieur Resingade's\r\nrecommendation; but 'tis always the fate of women to obey, and my\r\npapa has promised me to a Mr. Cassotti. I am afraid I shall never\r\nunderstand it as well as you do.\" By 1710 she was quoting Italian\r\nverse, and in the following year she corresponded with Mr. Resingade\r\nin Italian. That she was still working under Mr. Cassotti in 1712\r\nis apparent from her request that Mr. Wortley should send one of\r\nhis letters to her under the care of Mr. Cassotti, her \"Italian\r\nmaster.\" At this period, or a little later, she also learned French,\r\nso that she wrote letters and essays in that language. Her continued\r\ndevotion to study is shown by a letter from Thoresby to Anne Wortley\r\nin 1709: \"I am now so much alone, I have leisure to pass whole days\r\nin reading.... My study is nothing but dictionaries and grammars. I\r\nam trying whether it be possible to learn without a master; I am not\r\ncertain (and dare hardly hope) I shall make any great progress; but I\r\nfind the study so diverting. I am not only easy, but pleased with the\r\nsolitude that indulges it.\"[287]\r\n\r\nLady Mary's diligence resulted in 1710 in a translation of the Latin\r\nversion of the _Enchiridion_ of Epictetus which she sent to Bishop\r\nBurnet with a notable letter. Of the translation she says: \"Here is\r\nthe work of one week of my solitude--by the many faults in it your\r\nlordship will easily believe I spent no more time upon it; it was\r\nhardly finished when I was obliged to begin my journey, and I had\r\nnot leisure to write it over again. You have it here without any\r\ncorrections with all its blots and errors.\" Bishop Burnet returned\r\nthe document with emendations which in the present printed form are\r\ngiven in italics.[288] In spite of the numerous changes suggested\r\nas closer to the original, the translation remains as a remarkable\r\nproduction for a self-educated girl of twenty. Even more remarkable\r\nas evidencing maturity of thought and command of an admirable\r\nEnglish style is the letter, which is of particular significance in\r\nconnection with the contemporary attitude towards the learned woman:\r\n\r\n  My sex is usually forbid studies of this nature, and folly\r\n  reckoned so much our proper sphere, we are sooner pardoned any\r\n  excesses of that, than the least pretensions to reading or\r\n  good sense. We are permitted no books but such as tend to the\r\n  weakening and effeminating of the mind. Our natural defects are\r\n  every way indulged, and it is looked upon as in a degree criminal\r\n  to improve our reason, or fancy we have any. We are taught to\r\n  place all our art in adorning our outward forms, and permitted,\r\n  without reproach, to carry that custom even to extravagancy,\r\n  while our minds are entirely neglected, and, by disuse of\r\n  reflections, filled with nothing but the trifling objects our\r\n  eyes are daily entertained with. This custom, so long established\r\n  and industriously upheld, makes it even ridiculous to go out\r\n  of the common road, and forces one to find as many excuses as\r\n  if it was a thing altogether criminal not to play the fool in\r\n  concert with other women of quality, whose birth and leisure only\r\n  serve to render them the most useless and most worthless part\r\n  of the creation. There is hardly a character in the world more\r\n  despicable, or more liable to universal ridicule, than that of\r\n  a learned woman: those words imply, according to the received\r\n  sense, a tattling, impertinent, vain, and conceited creature. I\r\n  believe nobody will deny that learning may have this effect, but\r\n  it must be a very superficial degree of it. Erasmus was certainly\r\n  a man of great learning and good sense, and he seems to have my\r\n  opinion of it when he says, _Fæmina qui_ (sic) _vere sapit, non\r\n  videtur sibi sapere; contra, quæ cum nihil sapiat sibi videtur\r\n  sapere ea demum bis stulta est._ The Abbé Bellegarde gives a\r\n  right reason for women's talking overmuch: they know nothing, and\r\n  every outward object strikes their imagination, and produces a\r\n  multitude of thoughts, which, if they knew more, they would know\r\n  not worth their thinking of. I am not now arguing for an equality\r\n  of the two sexes. I do not doubt God and nature have thrown us\r\n  into an inferior rank; we are a lower part of the creation, we\r\n  owe obedience and submission to the superior sex, and any woman\r\n  who suffers her vanity and folly to deny this, rebels against\r\n  the law of the Creator, and indisputable order of nature: but\r\n  there is a worse effect than this, which follows the careless\r\n  education given to women of quality, its being so easy for any\r\n  man of sense, that finds it either his interest or his pleasure,\r\n  to corrupt them.[289]\r\n\r\nIn 1712 Lady Mary married Mr. Wortley Montagu, in 1713 her son was\r\nborn, and in 1715 she started with her husband on their journey\r\nto Turkey. The six years between the _Enchiridion_ and the Embassy\r\npresent Lady Mary to us in an enviable position. The reputation\r\nof her youth was augmented. \"The wittiest as well as one of the\r\nmost beautiful women of her day, she numbered among her admirers\r\nthe most powerful of the statesmen, and the most brilliant of the\r\n_littérateurs_; while, for a time at least she was a favourite at\r\nthe rival Courts of the King and the Prince of Wales.\"[290] The\r\nonly literary output of this period is a long, rather stilted and\r\nperfunctory criticism of Addison's _Cato_ which she undertook at her\r\nhusband's request,[291] and some _Court Poems_ which she wrote with\r\ngreat zest, in conjunction with Pope and Gay, in pursuance of Gay's\r\nplan to ridicule the pastoral by keeping the form, but making it the\r\nvehicle of corrupt court and town life. Of the seven poems so written\r\nfour were by Lady Mary. In them we come for the first time on her\r\npower of combining picturesque detail and caustic comment. Not Gay\r\nhimself was richer in local color; and Pope and Swift were almost\r\nequaled in contemptuous social portraiture.\r\n\r\nDuring the six years before the Embassy Lady Mary's activities\r\nwere essentially those of a social leader and the mistress of a\r\nhousehold. But all her interests were focused to one point when she\r\nfound that she could go to Turkey with Mr. Montagu. Travel \"is the\r\nthing on earth I most wish,\" she had written in 1710, and now that\r\nher husband was sent as Ambassador to the Porte, her dreams could be\r\nrealized. She must have been a perfect traveling companion. She had\r\ngreat courage, great endurance; no hardships or dangers daunted her.\r\nDuring the fifteen months of their absence she had her three-year-old\r\nson to care for, and her daughter was born while they were in\r\nConstantinople, but nothing interfered with her zest for experiences.\r\nEach day was a new adventure. Each day her insatiable desire to learn\r\nand to know some new thing received some new satisfaction. During\r\nthe journey she kept a full diary which, though not published till\r\nafter her death, became known in manuscript soon after her return.\r\nCertainly by 1725 she had prepared a copy with an eye to publication.\r\nTo this manuscript Mary Astell wrote a Preface, signed \"M. A.,\" and\r\ndated 1725. Mary Astell was twenty-two years older than Lady Mary for\r\nwhom she had a strong personal affection, as well as a very sincere\r\npride in her reputation as a learned woman. The Preface would seem to\r\nindicate that Lady Mary's \"enviers\" and \"enemies\" had not decreased\r\nsince her girlhood days:\r\n\r\n  In short [says Mary Astell] let her own sex, at least, do her\r\n  justice; lay aside diabolical Envy, and its brother Malice, with\r\n  all their accursed company, sly whispering, cruel backbiting,\r\n  spiteful detraction, and the rest of that hideous crew, which,\r\n  I hope, are very falsely said to attend the _Tea-Table_, being\r\n  more apt to think they attend those public places where virtuous\r\n  women never come. Let the men malign one another, if they think\r\n  fit, and strive to pull down merit, when they cannot equal it.\r\n  Let us be better-natured, than to give way to any unkind or\r\n  disrespectful thought of so bright an ornament of our sex merely\r\n  because she has better sense; for I doubt not but our hearts\r\n  will tell us, that this is the real and unpardonable offense,\r\n  whatever may be pretended. Let us be better Christians, than to\r\n  look upon her with an evil eye, only because the Giver of all\r\n  good gifts has entrusted and adorned her with the most excellent\r\n  talents. Rather let us freely own the superiority of this sublime\r\n  genius, as I do in the sincerity of my soul, pleased that a woman\r\n  triumphs, and proud to follow in her train. Let us offer her\r\n  the palm which is so justly her due; and if we pretend to any\r\n  laurels, lay them willingly at her feet.\r\n\r\nAfter Lady Mary's return to England in 1718 we come upon a long\r\nperiod of quiescence. Domestic affairs, events of social and\r\npolitical life, her friendships and hatreds, her economies and stock\r\nspeculations, completely occupied her. During the first part of this\r\nperiod she was extravagantly praised. Steele said of her in his essay\r\non Inoculation:\r\n\r\n  This ornament of her Sex and Country, who ennobles her own\r\n  Nobility by her Learning, Wit and Virtues, accompanying her\r\n  consort into Turkey, observed the Benefit of this Practice, with\r\n  its frequency, even among these obstinate Predestinarians, and\r\n  brought it over for the service and safety of her native England,\r\n  where she consecrated its first effects on the persons of her own\r\n  fine children.\r\n\r\nIn 1720 Pope wrote\r\n\r\n          In beauty and wit\r\n          No Mortal as yet\r\n      To question your empire has dared:\r\n        But men of discerning\r\n        Have thought that in learning\r\n      To yield to a lady was hard.\r\n\r\n          Impertinent schools,\r\n          With musty dull rules,\r\n      Have reading to females denied;\r\n        So Papists refuse\r\n        The Bible to use,\r\n      Lest flocks should be wise as their guide.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          But if the first Eve\r\n          Hard doom did receive\r\n      When only one apple had she,\r\n        What a punishment new\r\n        Shall be found out for you,\r\n      Who, tasting, have robbed the whole tree.\r\n\r\nAnd in 1727 he wrote in _Sandys' Ghost_:\r\n\r\n      Ye ladies, too, draw forth your pen,\r\n        I pray where can the hurt lie?\r\n      Since you have brains as well as men,\r\n        As witness Lady Wortley.\r\n\r\nBefore 1724 Dr. Young had sent her his tragedy _The Brothers_,\r\nrequesting her criticism. In 1725 Richard Savage dedicated his\r\n_Miscellanies_ to her as one through whose elevated and immortal wit\r\nEngland had been honored, and who had firmly established the fact\r\nthat women have \"strength of mind in proportion to their sweetness.\"\r\nAnd Henry Fielding, her second cousin, sent her his comedies,\r\n\"exceedingly anxious\" for her opinion of them.\r\n\r\nBut after 1724 or 1725 the years seem to slip on in an aimless\r\nfashion, the only breaks in the monotony coming from the\r\nintermittently virulent quarrels with Pope, the religious and medical\r\nanimosities roused by the inoculation process, family sorrows and\r\nfamily discords, with no literary output to mark any personal\r\nachievements. From thirty to fifty should have been harvest years\r\nafter so brilliant a beginning. But the early promise faded into a\r\nmiddle age disillusioned, unambitious, and rather commonplace. The\r\nonly writing of any importance was in the correspondence kept up in a\r\ndesultory fashion with various friends. Such of the letters of this\r\nperiod as have been preserved are so vivid and picturesque, so witty,\r\nand so pleasantly caustic in their comment, that we can only regret\r\ntheir small number. Take for instance the following description of a\r\nfeminine riot in the House of Commons:\r\n\r\n  At the last warm debate in the House of Lords, it was unanimously\r\n  resolved there should be no crowd of unnecessary auditors;\r\n  consequently the fair sex were excluded, and the gallery destined\r\n  to the sole use of the House of Commons. Notwithstanding which\r\n  determination, a tribe of dames resolved to show on this occasion\r\n  that neither men nor laws could resist them. These heroines were\r\n  Lady Huntington, the Duchess of Queensberry, the Duchess of\r\n  Ancaster, Lady Westmoreland, Lady Cobham, Lady Charlotte Edwin,\r\n  Lady Archibald Hamilton, and her daughter, Mrs. Scott, and Mrs.\r\n  Pendarves, and Lady Frances Saunderson. I am thus particular\r\n  in their names, since I look upon them to be the boldest\r\n  asserters, and most resigned sufferers for liberty, I ever read\r\n  of. They presented themselves at the door at nine o'clock in\r\n  the morning, where Sir William Saunderson respectfully informed\r\n  them the Chancellor had made an order against their admittance.\r\n  The Duchess of Queensberry, as head of the squadron, pished at\r\n  the ill-breeding of a mere lawyer, and desired him to let them\r\n  upstairs privately. After some modest refusals, he swore by\r\n  G---- he would not let them in. Her grace, with a noble warmth,\r\n  answered, by G---- they would come in in spite of the Chancellor\r\n  and the whole House. This being reported, the Peers resolved to\r\n  starve them out; an order was made that the doors should not be\r\n  opened till they had raised their siege. These Amazons now showed\r\n  themselves qualified for the duty even of foot soldiers; they\r\n  stood there till five in the afternoon, without either sustenance\r\n  or evacuation, every now and then playing volleys of thumps,\r\n  kicks, and raps against the door, with so much violence that the\r\n  speakers in the House were scarce heard. When the Lords were not\r\n  to be conquered by this, the two duchesses (very well apprised of\r\n  the use of stratagems in war) commanded a dead silence of half\r\n  an hour; and the Chancellor, who thought this a certain proof of\r\n  their absence (the Commons also being very impatient to enter),\r\n  gave order for the opening of the door; upon which they all\r\n  rushed in, pushed aside their competitors, and placed themselves\r\n  in the front rows of the gallery. They stayed there till after\r\n  eleven, when the House rose; and during the debate gave applause\r\n  and showed marks of dislike, not only by smiles and winks (which\r\n  have always been allowed in these cases), but by noisy laughs and\r\n  apparent contempts; which is supposed the true reason why poor\r\n  Lord Hervey spoke miserably.[292]\r\n\r\nIn 1739 Lady Mary drifted, without settled plan, to Italy, and there\r\nher self-elected exile lengthened itself insensibly into a habit of\r\nabsence, so that she did not return to England till 1761, the year\r\nbefore her death. During this period she kept a full journal, and\r\nprojected other work, but brought nothing to fruition.[293] Her chief\r\noccupation was reading. Her voracious appetite for fiction passed\r\nover from her girlhood absorption in French romances to the novels\r\ncrowding the presses of the mid-eighteenth century. The events of her\r\nplacid life were boxes of books from England, and the novels she read\r\nwould make an adequate list even for Polly Honeycomb. Lady Orford\r\nsaid she wondered how any one could find pleasure in the books Lady\r\nMary chose. But Lady Mary confessed herself \"a rake in reading,\" and\r\nsaid, in 1750: \"I thank God my taste still continues for the gay\r\npart of reading. Wiser people may think it trifling but it serves to\r\nsweeten life to me.\"[294] In 1752 her daughter sent her _Peregrine\r\nPickle_ (1751), Lady Vane's _Memoirs_ (1750), _The Fortunate Parish\r\nGirl_ (1750), _Pompey the Little_ (1751), _Eleanora's Adventures_\r\n(1751) and the _Life of Mrs. Constantia Philips_, as among the\r\ninteresting new books. In a letter to Lady Bute Lady Mary wrote:\r\n\r\n  I see in the newspapers the names of the following books:\r\n  Fortunate Mistress, Accomplished Rake, Mrs. Charke's Memoirs,\r\n  Modern Lovers, History of Two Orphans, Memoirs of David Ranger,\r\n  Miss [Mos]tyn, Dick Hazard, History of a Lady Platonist, Sophia\r\n  Shakespear, Jasper Banks, Frank Hammond, Sir Andrew Thompson,\r\n  Van a Clergyman's Son, Cleanthes and Celimena. I do not doubt\r\n  at least the greatest part of these are trash, lumber, etc.;\r\n  however, they will serve to pass away the idle time, if you will\r\n  be so kind to send them to your most affectionate mother.[295]\r\n\r\nAnd she read English drama from _Gammer Gurton's Needle_ to Lillo's\r\n_George Barnwell_, her prime favorite.[296]\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-two years in Italy Lady Mary was practically alone,\r\nbut she says time never hung heavy on her hands. She wrote letters\r\nconstantly, and her interest never flagged in the affairs of England\r\nin general and of Lady Bute's family in particular. As the daughters\r\ngrew up, Lady Mary wrote often about their education, and we see that\r\nthe ideas of the letter to Bishop Burnet persist. In 1753 she wrote\r\nconcerning Lady Mary, the eldest granddaughter, who had shown herself\r\nexcellent in arithmetic:\r\n\r\n  Learning, if she has a real taste for it, will not only make\r\n  her contented, but happy in it. No entertainment is so cheap\r\n  as reading, nor any pleasure so lasting. She will not want new\r\n  fashions, nor regret the loss of expensive diversions, or variety\r\n  of company, if she can be amused with an author in her closet.\r\n  To render this amusement extensive, she should be permitted to\r\n  learn the languages. I have heard it lamented that boys lose so\r\n  many years in mere learning of words: this is no objection to a\r\n  girl, whose time is not so precious: she cannot advance herself\r\n  in any profession, and has therefore more hours to spare; and as\r\n  you say her memory is good, she will be very agreeably employed\r\n  in this way. There are two cautions to be given on this subject:\r\n  first, not to think herself learned when she can read Latin, or\r\n  even Greek. Languages are more properly to be called vehicles\r\n  of learning than learning itself, as may be observed in many\r\n  schoolmasters, who, though perhaps critics in grammar, are the\r\n  most ignorant fellows on earth. True knowledge consists in\r\n  knowing things, not words. I would wish her no further a linguist\r\n  than to enable her to read books in their originals, that are\r\n  often corrupted, and always injured by translations. Two hours\r\n  application every morning will bring this about much sooner than\r\n  you can imagine, and she will have leisure enough besides to run\r\n  over the English poetry, which is a more important part of a\r\n  woman's education than it is generally supposed.... If she has\r\n  the same inclination (I should say passion) for learning that I\r\n  was born with, history, geography, and philosophy will furnish\r\n  her with materials to pass away cheerfully a longer life than is\r\n  allotted to mortals. I believe there are few heads capable of\r\n  making Sir I. Newton's calculations, but the result of them is\r\n  not difficult to be understood by a moderate capacity. Do not\r\n  fear this should make her affect the character of Lady ----,\r\n  of Lady ----, or Mrs. ----: These women are ridiculous, not\r\n  because they have learning, but because they have it not. One\r\n  thinks herself a complete historian, after reading Echard's Roman\r\n  History; another a profound philosopher, having got by heart some\r\n  of Pope's unintelligible essays; and a third an able divine, on\r\n  the strength of Whitfield's sermons: thus you hear them screaming\r\n  politics and controversy.[297]\r\n\r\nIn the next letter Lady Mary shows some doubt as to the wisdom of\r\ngiving advice so outspoken on the subject of learning. She says:\r\n\r\n  I cannot help writing a sort of apology for my last letter,\r\n  foreseeing that you will think it wrong, or at least Lord Bute\r\n  will be extremely shocked at the proposal of a learned education\r\n  for daughters, which the generality of men believe as great a\r\n  profanation as the clergy would do if the laity should presume to\r\n  exercise the functions of the priesthood. I desire you would take\r\n  notice, I would not have learning enjoined them as a task, but\r\n  permitted as a pleasure, if their genius leads them naturally to\r\n  it.[298]\r\n\r\nLater in the same letter she says:\r\n\r\n  There is nothing so like the education of a woman of quality as\r\n  that of a prince: they are taught to dance, and the exterior\r\n  part of what is called good breeding, which, if they attain,\r\n  they are extraordinary creatures in their kind, and have all the\r\n  accomplishments required by their directors. The same characters\r\n  are formed by the same lessons, which inclines me to think (if I\r\n  dare say it) that nature has not placed us in an inferior rank to\r\n  men, no more than the females of other animals, where we see no\r\n  distinction of capacity; though, I am persuaded, if there was a\r\n  commonwealth of rational horses (as Doctor Swift has supposed),\r\n  it would be an established maxim among them, that a mare could\r\n  not be taught to pace.\r\n\r\nIn October of the same year she wrote further on the subject of the\r\nlearned woman:\r\n\r\n  I confess I have often been complimented, since I have been in\r\n  Italy, on the books I have given the public. I used at first\r\n  to deny it with some warmth; but, finding I persuaded nobody,\r\n  I have of late contented myself with laughing whenever I heard\r\n  it mentioned, knowing the character of a learned woman is far\r\n  from being ridiculous in this country, the greatest families\r\n  being proud of having produced female writers; and a Milanese\r\n  lady being now professor of mathematics in the University of\r\n  Bologna, invited thither by a most obliging letter, wrote by the\r\n  present Pope, who desired her to accept of the chair, not as a\r\n  recompense for her merit, but to do honor to a town which is\r\n  under his protection. To say truth, there is no part of the world\r\n  where our sex is treated with so much contempt as in England.\r\n  I do not complain of men for having engrossed the government:\r\n  in excluding us from all degrees of power, they preserve us\r\n  from many fatigues, many dangers, and perhaps many crimes. The\r\n  small proportion of authority that has fallen to my share (only\r\n  over a few children and servants) always has been a burden and\r\n  never a pleasure, and I believe every one finds it so who acts\r\n  from a maxim (I think an indispensable duty), that whoever is\r\n  under my power is under my protection. Those who find a joy in\r\n  inflicting hardships and seeing objects of misery, may have\r\n  other sensations; but I have always thought corrections, even\r\n  when necessary, as painful to the giver as to the sufferer, and\r\n  am therefore very well satisfied with the state of subjection\r\n  we are placed in: but I think it the highest injustice to be\r\n  debarred the entertainment of my closet, and that the same\r\n  studies which raise the character of a man should hurt that of\r\n  a woman. We are educated in the grossest ignorance, and no art\r\n  omitted to stifle our natural reason; if some few get above their\r\n  nurse's instructions, our knowledge must rest concealed, and be\r\n  as useless to the world as gold in a mine. I am speaking now\r\n  according to our English notions, which may wear out, some ages\r\n  hence, along with others equally absurd.[299]\r\n\r\nLady Montagu died in London in 1762. Her _Turkish Letters_ were\r\npublished the next year. Her miscellaneous correspondence came\r\nout in 1807. Nor was her real significance apparent until both\r\npublications were accessible. It was then at once recognized that\r\nno English letter-writer had surpassed Lady Mary in brilliancy and\r\nwit. Her eye was so quick and accurate that no interesting details\r\nof dress or manner escaped her. As a chronicler and critic of social\r\nfaults and foibles she was cool, keen, merciless. She was graphic in\r\nphrase, homely and direct in figures of speech, racy and idiomatic.\r\nThe whole tone of her writing was free, lively, energetic, and she\r\ncould make any topic entertaining. As a person there seems to be\r\nground for two opposite opinions concerning Lady Mary. People admired\r\nher and praised her, or they hated her and told scandalous stories\r\nabout her. But as a writer there could be but one opinion. She was\r\nnot the first woman of letters to be eulogized, but she was the first\r\nwoman, not in fiction or drama, whose writings every one wished to\r\nread.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. De la Rivière Manley (1672-1724)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Manley,[300] a gentlewoman of good family, the daughter\r\nof Sir Roger Manley, was left an orphan while still young. Her\r\nguardian, a cousin twenty years older than herself, tricked her\r\ninto a false marriage, and then, on the birth of a child, announced\r\nthe cheat and disappeared. Most of the fortune left by her father\r\nhad also vanished. The details of her life after this until she\r\nbegan her career of authorship are but vaguely known. In 1696 she\r\nmade a threefold appeal to the public in _Letters written by Mrs.\r\nManley_;[301] _The Lost Lover_, a comedy written in seven days,\r\nproduced at Drury Lane, and not successful; and _The Royal Mischief_,\r\nsuccessfully brought out at Lincoln's Inn Fields. In the Preface\r\nto her _Letters_ (1696) Mrs. Manley spoke of the eager contention\r\nbetween the theaters as to which should bring her on the stage, but\r\ndrama was not her natural medium. When, after a silence of nine\r\nyears, she again appeared as an author, it was with _The Secret\r\nHistory of Queen Zarah_ (1705), a precursor of the scandalous\r\npersonal and political memories for which she became known. In\r\n1709 she published _Secret Memoirs and Manners of several Persons\r\nof Quality of Both Sexes. From the New Atalantis, an Island in the\r\nMediterranean._ The popularity of this book brought a second volume\r\nthe same year. In 1710 appeared _Memoirs of Europe towards the Close\r\nof the Eighth Century_. This and a second volume were afterwards\r\nreprinted as the third and fourth volumes of _The New Atalantis_. The\r\nsixth edition of _The New Atalantis_ had a _Key_ at the end of the\r\nfourth volume.\r\n\r\nThis book purported to be by an Italian and put into English by an\r\nanonymous translator. The plan of the romance is that of a journey\r\nwhere Astræa (Mrs. Behn revisiting the earth), Fame, and Virtue are\r\nconducted invisibly about while their guide, \"Intelligence,\" tells\r\nthem the secret histories of the persons they meet. Under this thin\r\ndisguise the statesmen, wits, and beauties of the reign of William\r\nand Mary and Queen Anne were at once recognized. Mrs. Manley, the\r\npublisher, and the printer, were arrested. On her own testimony,\r\nhowever, the blame was counted hers and she was examined before the\r\ncourt, but after about three months she was discharged. And the later\r\nvolumes followed with no public expression of disapproval.\r\n\r\nIn 1711 Mrs. Manley succeeded Swift as editor of _The Examiner_. In\r\n1714 appeared _The Adventures of Rivella, or, the History of the\r\nAuthor of Atalantis, by Sir Charles Lovemore_. In 1724 Curll brought\r\nthis out as _Mrs. Manley's History of Her own Life and Times_, and\r\nit was probably written by her. In 1720 _The Power of Love in Seven\r\nVolumes, and Verses_, in Anthony Hammond's _New Miscellany_, close\r\nher contributions to literature. She died at the house of Alderman\r\nBarker whose mistress she had been for several years.\r\n\r\nA fact of central interest about Mrs. Manley's personal and literary\r\ncareer is her quarrel with Steele which kept up with long lulls and\r\nacrimonious crises from before 1709 to 1717. In the first volume\r\nof _The New Atalantis_[302] she gave an account of Steele as\r\n\"Monsieur le Ingrate,\" narrating in detail her aid in rescuing him\r\nfrom the impostors who were leading him into ruinous expenses in\r\nsearch of the philosopher's stone, and bitterly assailing him for\r\nhis later ingratitude in the time of her own distresses. In the same\r\nyear _The Tatler_, No. 35, possibly referred to Mrs. Manley under\r\nthe description of the snuff-eating lady. Certainly in September\r\nSwift represented her, under the name of \"Epicene,\" as one of the\r\nprofessors in Madonella's college. Mrs. Manley, assuming that the\r\npaper was by Steele, wrote a denunciatory letter, which he answered\r\nin mild fashion, owning his former indebtedness to her and explaining\r\nhis inability to aid her when she appealed to him. In the third and\r\nfourth volumes of _The New Atalantis_ (1710) were further attacks\r\non Steele.[303] This third volume was dedicated to him as \"Isaac\r\nBickerstaffe.\" She quoted his letter, but omitted some of the\r\nmitigating sentences. Of the \"mighty Tatlers\" leveled at her she\r\nsays: \"A weak, unlearn'd Woman's Writings, to employ so great a Pen!\r\nHeavens? how valuable am I? How fond of that _Immortality_, even of\r\n_Infamy_, that you have promised! I am ravished at the Thoughts of\r\n_living a Thousand Years hence_ in your indelible lines, tho' to\r\n_give Offence_.... I shall be proud of furnishing Matter towards your\r\ninexhaustible _Tatler_, and of being a perpetual Monument of Mr.\r\nBickerstaffe's Gallantry and Morality.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1713, (_The Guardian_, No. 128), Steele entered the\r\ncontroversy concerning the demolition of Dunkirk. Mrs. Manley\r\nanswered with a pamphlet in which the \"honour and Prerogative of the\r\nQueen's Majesty\" were defended \"against the unexampled Insolence of\r\nthe Author of the Guardian.\" This closed the open hostilities, and\r\nby 1717 there were handsome apologies and frank admissions of error\r\non both sides, and the reconciliation seems to have been complete.\r\nThe chief interest we find in Mrs. Manley's play is the fact that\r\nSteele wrote the Prologue and that the play was dedicated to him. In\r\nthis Dedication she said, \"I have not known a greater mortification\r\nthan when I have reflected upon the severities which have flowed\r\nfrom a pen which is now, you see, disposed to celebrate and commend\r\nyou.\"[304]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Elizabeth Thomas (1677-1731)]\r\n\r\nDryden conferred upon Mrs. Thomas the title of \"Corinna\" and says, \"I\r\nwould have called you Sapho, but that I hear you are handsomer.\" The\r\nyoung poetess had received no regular education, but she improved her\r\nmind by reading the politest authors, and finally, at twenty-two, she\r\nventured forth as a poet herself. She sent two poems to Mr. Dryden\r\nasking his critical judgment of them. He responded with the following\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n  _Fair Corinna_,\r\n\r\n  I have sent your two poems back again, after having kept them so\r\n  long from you: They were I thought too good to be a woman's; some\r\n  of my friends to whom I read them, were of the same opinion. It\r\n  is not very gallant I must confess to say this of the fair sex;\r\n  but, most certain it is, they generally write with more softness\r\n  than strength. On the contrary, you want neither vigour in your\r\n  thoughts, nor force in your expression, nor harmony in your\r\n  numbers; and methinks, I find much of Orinda in your manner, (to\r\n  whom I had the honour to be related, and also to be known) but I\r\n  am so taken up with my own studies, that I have not leisure to\r\n  descend to particulars, being in the meantime, the fair Corinna's\r\n\r\n  Most humble, and\r\n  Most faithful servant\r\n  JOHN DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n  Nov. 12, 1699.\r\n\r\nThe poetical career thus auspiciously begun with the praise of\r\nthe great poet ended in disaster. After the death of Mr. Gwinnet,\r\nwho had courted her for sixteen years, in 1717, and of her mother\r\nin 1719, she was always in financial straits and used almost any\r\nmeans to avoid her creditors. During the time when she was living\r\nunder the protection of Mr. Henry Cromwell, she gained possession\r\nof twenty-five letters written to him by Mr. Pope. These she sold\r\nto Curll, who published them in 1726, and she thus gained a\r\ndisgraceful place in _The Dunciad_. Her _Poems_ were published in\r\n1722, 1726, 1727, but she does not seem to have been rewarded with\r\neither fame or money. Besides other unimportant literary work she\r\nwrote an autobiography entitled _Pylades and Corinna; or, Memoirs\r\nof the Lives, Amours, and Writings of Richard Gwinnet, Esquire, and\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Thomas, junior.... To which is prefixed the Life of\r\nCorinna, written by herself._ This was published in 1731 in two\r\nvolumes. The autobiography in an abridged form appears in Cibber's\r\n_Lives of the Poets_.[305]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Eliza Haywood (1693-1756)]\r\n\r\nMiss Eliza Fowler, the daughter of a small shopkeeper in London, was\r\nmarried before she was twenty to the Reverend Valentine Haywood.[306]\r\nIn 1721 she left her husband[307] and thereafter she had her own\r\nway to make. A few unimportant attempts as an actress[308] and some\r\noccasional unsuccessful attempts as a playwright may be set aside\r\nas not belonging to her real career. It was as a writer of romantic\r\ntales and novels that she achieved success. This vein once tapped,\r\nthe ore, such as it was, seemed inexhaustible. From 1719 to 1756 Mrs.\r\nHaywood published about seventy single works, nearly all of them\r\n\"fictitious tales.\"[309] If we should count various editions, the\r\nnumbers of times she was privileged to see some work by her issue\r\nfrom the press during her thirty-seven years of authorship would\r\nexceed one hundred and fifty. Her most prolific years were 1724 to\r\n1728, thirty-three new books appearing during this short time.\r\n\r\nThis crowding of book after book through the press, the numerous\r\neditions of the more popular novels, and the fact that four\r\n\"Collections\" of her works had appeared by 1729, sufficiently attest\r\nher extraordinary contemporary popularity. Mrs. Haywood's fecundity\r\nis not a matter for great surprise. It is easy to understand that\r\nif she could write one novel like _Love in Excess_, she could write\r\nhalf a hundred more without seriously taxing her creative spirit. But\r\nto the present-day reader her popularity seems incredible. Of what\r\nsort was the reading public that stimulated her and her publishers to\r\nsuch activity? According to Mr. Gosse's conjecture in \"What Ann Lang\r\nRead,\" \"Eliza was read by servants in the kitchen, by seamstresses,\r\nby basket-women, by prentices of all sorts, male and female, but\r\nchiefly the latter.\"[310] But Mr. Whicher points out that Mrs.\r\nHaywood's novels were never issued in cheap form, and that one to\r\nthree shillings for a slender octavo would put the books beyond the\r\npurses of the servant class.[311] In all probability Ann Lang, the\r\nmilliner's apprentice, is less truly representative of Mrs. Haywood's\r\nreaders than is Polly in Colman's _Polly Honeycomb_ (1760). Polly did\r\nnot begin her career as a novel-reader till more than a decade after\r\nthe appearance of _Pamela_, so that a fairly wide range of fiction\r\nwas open to her, and Mrs. Haywood could be but one element of her\r\npossible literary joys. But we know that _The History of Miss Betsy\r\nThoughtless_ was one of her favorites, and the extracts she gives\r\nfrom Mrs. Haywood's previous novels and the names she cherishes,\r\nread like satires on that lady's heroics. If Polly may be counted as\r\ntypical of Mrs. Haywood's public, we have readers distinctly above\r\nthe servant class. Mr. Honeycomb was a well-to-do tradesman with\r\nclerks in the office and a fairly elaborate domestic establishment.\r\nPolly may even have been to a finishing school. There are also\r\nindications of a class of readers higher still. The ladies of fashion\r\nwho so attentively pursued Mrs. Manley's _New Atalantis_ could hardly\r\nbe supposed indifferent to the social scandal in Mrs. Haywood's\r\n_Memoirs of a Certain Island_ and _The Court of Carimania_. In\r\nLeonora's library there was a _Book of Novels_ which would doubtless\r\nappeal to the same taste as Mrs. Haywood's tales. Furthermore, the\r\nimpassioned protests against novel-reading in all didactic addresses\r\nto young ladies would indicate a widespread devotion to fiction in\r\nthe higher social ranks.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haywood's popularity was certainly contributed to by a lack\r\nof important competitors. Before the advent of _Pamela_ the young\r\ngirl eager for stories must read French romances, Defoe's novels,\r\nor Mrs. Haywood's novels. Defoe was not particularly attractive to\r\nthe Pollys of the age, and the taste for the many-volumed romances,\r\nbeloved of ladies from Dorothy Osborne and Mrs. Pepys to Biddy Tipkin\r\nand Arabella,[312] was gradually dying out. So Mrs. Haywood had her\r\nchance. Her \"little Performances,\" as she called them, offered in\r\nbrief compass the love and adventure of the long romance without its\r\ntax on the reader's patience.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haywood's short romances have but one theme. \"Eliza writes, but\r\nLove alone inspires,\" is a correct analysis by one of her admirers.\r\nShe is the self-appointed chronicler of Love and all its attendant\r\npassions. She sets herself to trace \"The Wild Career of untamed Love\r\nin the proud Heart of Arbitrary Man\"; to note the thrilling ardors,\r\nthe languishments, the ecstasies and violent agitations on the part\r\nof the adored one; to depict with extravagant emphasis the jealousy,\r\nrage, despair, of disappointed affections. These experiences of the\r\nheart take place in the midst of adventures of the most melodramatic\r\nsort. Flights over land and sea are complicated by storms and\r\nshipwreck, by bandits and pirates. The heroic play itself is less\r\nprolific in elopements, seductions, duels, murders, and suicides.\r\nThe sword, the dagger, and the poison cup play an active part in\r\ncutting Gordian knots too intricately tied. There is small effort to\r\nmake the story probable. The whole effort is to make it exciting.\r\nThe reader is plunged from adventure to adventure with no breathing\r\nplace in which to be critical, and it is by this headlong speed that\r\nthe attention is held. But after reading several of the tales it\r\nbecomes apparent that to know one is to know all. The passions, the\r\nsituations, the obstacles, the dénouements recur. Nor are the people\r\ndifferentiated. The ardent lovers, their yielding or temporarily\r\nobdurate fair ones, the jealous lovers and mistresses, hard-hearted\r\nfathers, faithless friends, and mercenary confidants, make up the\r\npersonnel of each story. Among the hundreds of characters there is\r\nnot one that remains in the memory as a real person. They are but\r\npuppets through whose convulsive starts and unnatural tones Mrs.\r\nHaywood vainly endeavors to make genuine passion speak.\r\n\r\nNor have these novels any additional points of interest such as might\r\ncome from witty dialogue, pungent comment, or beautiful description.\r\nMrs. Haywood's English is fluent, intelligible, and fairly correct,\r\nbut it never attains distinction. The total effect of these tales\r\nof passion is one of almost stupefying dullness and monotony. It is\r\npainful to reflect on the blunted moral, emotional, and æsthetic\r\nsensibilities of a generation of readers who found their solace in\r\n_The Excess of Love_ and its congeners.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haywood's activities suffered something of a check after 1729,\r\npossibly owing to the savage attacks on her by Pope in _The Dunciad_\r\n(1728).[313] At any rate, for some reason or combination of reasons,\r\nno new original works of any importance by her appeared between\r\n1729 and 1751. Among various expedients to earn a livelihood during\r\nthis period the most notable is her attempt to establish herself\r\nas a publisher in 1742, but since only two books are recorded\r\nas published by her she probably quickly found herself without\r\nthe business training for such an enterprise.[314] A more notable\r\nundertaking is _The Female Spectator_ edited and at least partly\r\nwritten by Mrs. Haywood in April, 1744--May, 1746.\r\n\r\nShe entered again the field of authorship with her best novels, _The\r\nHistory of Miss Betsy Thoughtless_, in four volumes (1751), and _The\r\nHistory of Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy_, three volumes (1752), which have\r\nthe merit of faintly foreshadowing the domestic novel of a later\r\nday.[315]\r\n\r\nThe paper is professedly modeled on the work of Addison and Steele.\r\nThe writing purports to be by an editorial group of four ladies with\r\nMrs. Haywood as editor-in-chief. A vivacious widow in whom lovers\r\nconfide; Euphrosine, so called because of her brightness and charm;\r\nand Mira, a lady of hereditary wit, complete the quadrumvirate. Their\r\navowed purpose is to give entertaining items of news, discuss dress,\r\ndecorum, and social foibles in friendly admonition, and analyze the\r\nhuman heart. But there is no real emphasis except on the last of\r\nthese topics. The Tenderillas, Claribellas, Elismondas, Dorindas, and\r\nthe rest, pursue their amorous way from volume to volume, unconscious\r\nthat the world holds any interest but love, that \"noblest, softest,\r\nand the best\" of all the passions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUPPOSED EDITORS OF _THE FEMALE SPECTATOR_ BY MRS.\r\nELIZA HAYWOOD\r\n\r\nFrom Vol. I of the seventh edition, 1771\r\n\r\nMrs. Haywood is the scribe; the lady in black is the vivacious widow\r\nof quality; the lady standing is \"Euphrosine\"; the other lady is\r\n\"Mira\"]\r\n\r\nBut now and then the editors or some contributor break out of\r\nthe charmed circle, and we get a glimpse of women who, along with\r\ntheir overworked hearts, have at least rudimentary minds. A certain\r\n\"Cleora\" urges that women's best qualities are often stifled by a\r\nwrong education, and that \"the world would infallibly be happier\r\nthan it is if women were more knowing than they generally are.\" The\r\nstudies suggested are history, geography, some of the more agreeable\r\nparts of mathematics, and \"Enchanting Philosophy, its path strewd\r\nwith Roses.\" Music, poetry, dancing, and novels are suggested by\r\nway of relaxation. For solid reading the recommendation includes\r\ntranslations of Latin historians and French books of travel, and\r\ncloses with _Bailey's Dictionary_, \"a library of itself since there\r\nwas never person, place or action of any note, from the creation\r\ndown to the time of its being published, but what it gives a general\r\naccount of.\" In another essay \"Philo-Naturæ\" spends impassioned\r\npages urging ladies to study natural history, but nullifies her\r\neloquence by the narrow limit she assigns to their work. \"It is easy\r\nto see, that it is not my ambition to render my sex what is called\r\ndeeply-learned.\" Women need only \"a kind of general understanding\"\r\nof science, such as will enable them to take an agreeable part\r\nin conversation. They are not called to abstruse and difficult\r\nresearches, but merely to those light and charming observations that\r\ncatch the watchful eye on little excursions such as ladies make in\r\nfields, meadows, and gardens.\r\n\r\nIn _The Wife_ (1755) Mrs. Haywood is less liberal than in _The\r\nSpectator_. The married lady is particularly warned against the\r\ndangers of an active mind or speculative disposition. She may be so\r\nmisguided as to \"attempt to investigate those things that Heaven has\r\nhidden from human understanding,\" in which case her brain will be\r\ndistracted by books of controversy. Or she may strangely busy her\r\nmind about the planets, wondering whether those vast and luminous\r\norbs are habitable, and if so, whether possessed by men or angels\r\nor the ghosts of the departed. A lady so fantastically engaged is\r\nlikely to waste her time over such books as Fontanelle's _Plurality\r\nof Worlds_.\r\n\r\n  A woman who once gets either of these fancies into her head,\r\n  is lost to everything besides; her husband, children, family,\r\n  friends, acquaintances, with all the necessary avocations and\r\n  duties of her station, seem altogether unworthy her regard; she\r\n  lives in the clouds, and it is with difficulty she is dragg'd\r\n  down to the performance of anything requir'd of her below.\r\n\r\n  Methinks it is down-right madness to waste any part of time in\r\n  seeking after things impossible to be attain'd; or if attain'd\r\n  could be of no real service:--a married woman, above all others,\r\n  should avoid this error:--it best becomes her to center her whole\r\n  studies within the compass of her own walls,--to enquire no\r\n  farther than into the humours and inclinations of her husband and\r\n  children, to the end she may know how to oblige those she finds\r\n  in him, and rectify whatever is amiss in them, and not attempt to\r\n  extend her speculations beyond her family, and those things which\r\n  are entrusted to her management.\r\n\r\nMrs. Haywood's programme reads like a combination from Molière's\r\nChrysal and Mrs. Barbauld.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1729 Swift wrote from Dublin to Pope:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Mary Barber (1690?-1757])\r\n\r\n  There are three citizens' wives in this town; one of them whose\r\n  name is Grierson, a Scotch book-seller's wife. She is a very good\r\n  Latin and Greek scholar, and has lately published a fine edition\r\n  of Tacitus, with a Latin dedication to the Lord Lieutenant; and\r\n  she writes _Carmina Anglicana non Contemnenda_. The second is one\r\n  Mrs. Barber, wife to a woolen draper, who is our chief poetess,\r\n  and, upon the whole, has no ill genius. I fancy I have mentioned\r\n  her to you formerly. The last is the bearer hereof, and the\r\n  wife of a surly rich husband, who checks her vein; whereas Mrs.\r\n  Grierson is only well to pass, and Mrs. Barber, as it becomes the\r\n  chief poetess, is but poor. The bearer's name is Sykins. She has\r\n  a very good taste of poetry, has read much, and, as I hear, has\r\n  writ one or two things with applause, which I never saw, except\r\n  about six lines she sent me unknown, with a piece of sturgeon,\r\n  some years ago, on my birthday. Can you show such a triumfeminate\r\n  in London?[316]\r\n\r\nSoon after Swift added Mrs. Pilkington to his list of Dublin writers,\r\nbut it still remains a triumfeminate, because we hear no more of Mrs.\r\nSykins, the surly rich husband having apparently been successful in\r\nchecking her vein. Her proposed visit to Pope was also a failure.\r\nShe went to Twickenham and delivered Swift's letter, but, for some\r\nunknown reason, returned to London two hours before the time Pope\r\nhad appointed to receive her. His irritation found expression in the\r\nreference to \"an Irish poetess\" as among his troublesome visitors in\r\none version of _The Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot_.[317]\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Barber would hardly be so much as a name to-day were it not\r\nfor Swift. He first met her in about the year 1729, and from that\r\ntime to 1736 letters to and from him have much to say concerning\r\nher career. She was then nearly forty, most of her poems existed\r\nin manuscript, she was already something of a celebrity in Dublin,\r\nand her one desire was a subscription publication of her work. In\r\npursuance of this wish she went to London late in 1730 and Swift\r\nsent kindly letters in her behalf to several of his London friends.\r\nIn the summer of 1731 a mysterious letter to the Queen, purporting\r\nto be from Swift, contained this passage: \"Mrs. Barber, the best\r\nfemale poet of this or perhaps any age, is now in your majesty's\r\ncapital; known to Lady Hertford, Lady Torrington, Lady Walpole,\r\netc.; a woman whose genius is honoured by every man of genius in\r\nthis kingdom, and either honoured or envied by every man of genius\r\nin England.\"[318] Pope sent a copy of this letter to Swift, who\r\nimmediately and indignantly, in letters to Pope and the Countess of\r\nSuffolk, disavowed it. Such a letter, he said, would be \"a folly so\r\ntranscendent, that no man could be guilty of, who was not fit for\r\nBedlam.\" In his letter to Pope Swift said of Mrs. Barber:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Delany has been long her protector; and he, being many years\r\n  my acquaintance, desired my good office for her, and brought her\r\n  several times to the deanery. I knew she was poetically given,\r\n  and, for a woman, had a sort of genius that way. She appeared\r\n  very modest and pious, and I believe was sincere; and wholy\r\n  turned to poetry. I did conceive her journey to England was on\r\n  the score of her trade, being a woollen-draper, until Dr. Delany\r\n  said, she had a design of printing her poems by subscription,\r\n  and desired I would befriend her: which I did, chiefly by your\r\n  means, the doctor still urging me on: upon whose request I writ\r\n  to her two or three times, because she thought my countenancing\r\n  her might be of use. Lord Carteret very much befriended her, and\r\n  she seems to have made her way not ill.[319]\r\n\r\nThe perpetrator of the forged letter and the purpose in sending it\r\nto the Queen have never been discovered, but the irritation arising\r\nfrom it might well have destroyed Swift's interest in Mrs. Barber's\r\nsubscription list. He apparently recognized, however, that she was\r\ninnocent of offense and continued his efforts in her behalf. Dr.\r\nArbuthnot writes that he has shown \"as much civility as he could\" to\r\nMrs. Barber.[320] Gay has \"made a visit to Mrs. Barber.\"[321] Lady\r\nBetty Germain says Mrs. Barber \"goes on in her subscription very\r\nwell.\"[322] But the list was incomplete by the summer of 1732 and\r\ndragged slowly on till 1734 in spite of the aid of Mr. Barber, Lord\r\nMayor of London, Mrs. Worsley, Mrs. Cæsar, Mrs. Conduitt, Miss Kelly,\r\nLord Carteret, Lord Orrery, and the Duchess of Queensberry, all of\r\nwhom in response to applications from Swift wrote to him concerning\r\nthe progress of Mrs. Barber's affairs. In 1733 Mrs. Conduitt wrote\r\nthat \"the town had already been so long invited into the subscription\r\nthat most people had already refused or accepted.\"[323] It was\r\nnot till 1734 that the list was considered long enough to make\r\npublication safe.\r\n\r\nSwift crowned his service by writing a dedicatory letter to Lord\r\nOrrery. In this letter he spoke of Mrs. Barber as follows:\r\n\r\n  She desireth your protection on account of her wit and good\r\n  sense, as well as of her humility, her gratitude, and many\r\n  other virtues. I have read most of her poems; and believe your\r\n  Lordship will observe, that they generally contain something\r\n  new and useful, tending to the reproof of some vice or folly,\r\n  or recommending some virtue. She never writes on a subject with\r\n  general unconnected topics, but always with a scheme and method\r\n  driving to some particular end: wherein many writers in verse,\r\n  and of some distinction, are so often known to fail. In short,\r\n  she seemeth to have a true poetical genius, better cultivated\r\n  than could be expected, either from her sex, or the scene she\r\n  hath acted in, as the wife of a citizen. Yet I am assured, that\r\n  no woman was ever more useful to her husband in the way of his\r\n  business. Poetry hath only been her favorite amusement; for which\r\n  she hath one qualification that I wish all good poets possess'd a\r\n  share of; I mean, that she is ready to take advice, and submit to\r\n  have her verse corrected, by those who are generally allow'd to\r\n  be the best judges.[324]\r\n\r\nBut for the persistent efforts of Swift the subscription would never\r\nhave been completed. Yet Mrs. Barber had gained incidentally such\r\na retinue of supporting friends that her poems were republished in\r\n1735 and 1736. There was apparently a touch of personal venom in the\r\npassage where Mrs. Pilkington chronicles the generous aid given Mrs.\r\nBarber and emphasizes the final small success of the poems:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Barber ... was at this time writing a volume of Poems,\r\n  some of which I fancy might, at this Day, be seen in the\r\n  Cheesemungers, Chandlers, Pastry-cooks, and Second-hand\r\n  Book-sellers' Shops: However, dull as they were, they certainly\r\n  would have been much worse, but that Dr. Delany frequently held\r\n  what he called a _Senatus Consultum_, to correct these undigested\r\n  materials; at which were present sometimes the Dean, (in the\r\n  Chair) but always Mrs. Grierson, Mr. Pilkington, the Doctor, and\r\n  myself.[325]\r\n\r\nA poem in which they were summoned to one of these meetings began:\r\n\r\n      Mighty _Thomas_ a solemn _Senatus_ I call,\r\n      To consult for _Saphira_, so come one and all.\r\n\r\nIn 1736 Mrs. Barber was again in financial straits. A scheme for\r\nletting lodgings, and another scheme for selling Irish linens at\r\nBath having proved impracticable, she made a final appeal to Swift.\r\nDr. King of Oxford and Mrs. Cleland had spoken so warmly of Swift's\r\n_Treatise on Polite Conversation_ that many people wished to see it,\r\nand Lady Worsley with many other of Mrs. Barber's patronesses urged\r\nher to ask Swift to let her publish it for her own benefit. After\r\napologies for asking such a favor she says:\r\n\r\n  I humbly beseech you, sir, if you do not think it proper not to\r\n  be offended with me for asking it; for it was others, that out of\r\n  kindness to me, put me upon it. They said you made no advantage\r\n  for yourself, by your writings; and that, since you honoured me\r\n  with your protection, I had all the reason in the world to think\r\n  it would be a pleasure to you, to see me in easy circumstances;\r\n  that everybody would gladly subscribe for anything Dr. Swift\r\n  wrote; and indeed, I believe in my conscience, it would be the\r\n  making of me.[326]\r\n\r\nDean Swift presented her with the copy and the sale proved\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\nThe career of a mediocre writer like Mrs. Barber would hardly justify\r\nchronicling were it not for the interesting exemplification it\r\noffers of the system of patronage. Swift and his influential friends\r\nmanifest no particular interest in Mrs. Barber's \"moral and not\r\ninelegant verse,\" but responsibility for her welfare seems to have\r\nbeen accepted by them without demur, nor does she seem to have felt\r\nany hesitancy about accepting any aid that might be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most vivid introduction to Mrs. Grierson comes from the pen of\r\nher early friend Mrs. Pilkington:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Constantia Grierson (1706?-33)]\r\n\r\n  About two years before this a young Woman of about eighteen\r\n  years of age, was brought to my Father, by a Stationer to be by\r\n  him instructed in Midwifery.[327] She was Mistress of _Hebrew_,\r\n  _Greek_, _Latin_, and _French_, understood the _mathematicks_,\r\n  as well as most men. And what made these extraordinary Talents\r\n  yet more surprizing was, that her Parents were poor illiterate\r\n  Country People; so that her learning appeared like the Gift\r\n  poured out on the Apostles, of speaking all languages, without\r\n  the Pains of Study; or, like the intuitive Knowledge of Angels:\r\n  Yet in as much as the Power of Miracles is ceased; we must allow\r\n  she used human Means for such great and excellent Acquirements:\r\n  And yet in a long Friendship and Familiarity with her, I could\r\n  never obtain a satisfactory Account from her on this Head;\r\n  only she said, \"she had received some little Instruction from\r\n  the Minister of the Parish, when she could spare time from her\r\n  Needlework, to which she was closely kept by her Mother.\" She\r\n  wrote elegantly both in Verse and Prose; and some of the most\r\n  delightful Hours I ever past, were in the Conversation of this\r\n  female Philosopher.\r\n\r\n  My Father readily consented to accept her as a Pupil; and gave\r\n  her a general Invitation to his Table, so that she and I were\r\n  seldom asunder. My Parents were well pleased with our Intimacy,\r\n  as her Piety was not inferior to her Learning. Whether it was\r\n  owing to her own Desire, or the Envy of those who survived her,\r\n  I know not; but of her various and beautiful Writings except\r\n  one Poem of her's in Mrs. Barber's Works, I have never seen any\r\n  published; 't is true, as her turn was chiefly to philosophical\r\n  or divine Subjects, they might not be agreeable to the present\r\n  Taste.[328]\r\n\r\nA eulogy of Mrs. Grierson was written by Henry Brooke (1703?-1783)\r\nthe author of a tragedy, _Gustavus Vasa_, and various popular novels,\r\nin a poem on \"The Art of Printing,\" and an account of her, derived\r\nfrom his notes, was published in _Brookiana_ in 1804.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Brooke has celebrated the learning, piety, and virtue, of\r\n  Mrs. Grierson, in a poem which he wrote on the Art of Printing.\r\n  This lady was born in the city of Kilkenny. Such is the vanity\r\n  of man, that he thinks he pays a sufficient compliment to woman,\r\n  when he says, she has a masculine mind, when, in truth, it is\r\n  known that there are many females on record, who have rivalled\r\n  the lords of the creation in every branch of science, and\r\n  department of learning. In this constellation the name of Mrs.\r\n  Grierson will shine with increasing luster. Her father observed,\r\n  that his daughter, while yet a child, was very fond of books, and\r\n  not-withstanding his circumstances were narrow, he was determined\r\n  to furnish her with all those that he thought were suited to her\r\n  years; but he soon found, to his great joy, that her capacity was\r\n  not to be measured by her years, it flew before them; and that\r\n  her genius and inclination would triumph over every difficulty,\r\n  even without the aid of a master. In a time that is almost too\r\n  short to be mentioned, she was allowed by competent judges, to\r\n  be a perfect mistress of the Greek and Roman tongues; and whilst\r\n  other young women were proud of carrying the keys of closets,\r\n  etc., she carried the keys of science, which she unlocked and\r\n  surveyed, not with a transient eye, but with the warmth and\r\n  constancy of one that fell in love with their beauties, and could\r\n  duly appreciate their charms, so that all her attainments may be\r\n  said to have been dictated by nature, aided by laudable curiosity\r\n  and industry. She was early married to George Grierson, Esq., the\r\n  king's printer. As he had a good library, she had an opportunity\r\n  of indulging her literary pursuits.[329]\r\n\r\nAfter her marriage Mrs. Grierson carried on her studies with such\r\nardor that at twenty-one she brought out an edition of Terence and at\r\ntwenty-three an edition of Tacitus. When she died at twenty-seven,\r\nshe left a partially completed edition of Sallust. Mrs. Barber\r\nsays that she also wrote an unpublished _Abridgment of the History\r\nof England_. Her Tacitus has received high praise. Dr. Harwood, a\r\nlearned bibliographer, commented on it in the following terms:\r\n\r\n  This is one of the best edited books ever delivered to the world.\r\n  _Mrs. Grierson_ was a lady possessed of singular erudition, and\r\n  had an elegance of taste and solidity of judgment, which justly\r\n  rendered her one of the most wonderful as well as amiable of her\r\n  sex. Prefixed to this edition of Tacitus, is a dedication to\r\n  _Lord Carteret_, in most elegant Latinity.[330]\r\n\r\nMrs. Grierson also wrote occasional verse a few specimens of which\r\nappear in Mrs. Pilkington's _Memoirs_, in _Poems by Eminent Ladies_,\r\nand in Mrs. Barber's edition of her own poems. Mrs. Barber in her\r\nPreface praised Mrs. Grierson and gave many of the facts used by\r\nlater writers. Mr. Ballard was anxious to give a full account of\r\nMrs. Grierson, and he wrote in 1747 to Mrs. Barber for further\r\ninformation. \"I likewise,\" says Mr. Ballard, \"got the same friend to\r\napply to a learned and eminent dignitary in the church in Ireland;\r\none who is thoroughly acquainted with all the various circumstances\r\nof her life and is every way qualified for the performance.\" The\r\neminent churchman promised an account of her life, but it never came\r\nto hand, so Mr. Ballard was obliged to content himself with a general\r\neulogy. He says, \"If Heaven had spared her life, and blessed her with\r\nhealth, which she wanted for some years before her death, there is\r\ngood reason to think she would have made as great a figure in the\r\nlearned world, as any of her sex are recorded to have done.\" Mrs.\r\nGrierson, \"the learned Nymph Whom Curiosity engaged every Person to\r\nsee,\"[331] was on intimate terms with Swift, Thomas Sheridan, and\r\nDr. Delany, and it is singular that a more exact account of her life\r\nshould not have been preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lætitia van Lewen Pilkington (1712-50)]\r\n\r\nLætitia Pilkington, the daughter of Dr. Van Lewen, a physician of\r\nDublin, was about twenty-two years younger than Mrs. Barber, but\r\nMrs. Barber's work came so late in her life and Mrs. Pilkington was\r\nso precocious that they were in effect poetical contemporaries.\r\nLætitia's love for literature and her lively mind were in evidence\r\nbefore she was five. She thus describes the beginning of her\r\neducation:\r\n\r\n  My mother strictly followed _Solomon's_ Advice, in never sparing\r\n  the Rod; insomuch that I have frequently been whipt for looking\r\n  blue of a frosty Morning; and whether I deserved it or not, I was\r\n  sure of Correction every Day of my life.\r\n\r\n  From my earliest Infancy I had a Disposition to Letters; but my\r\n  Eyes being weak after the Small-pox, I was not permitted to look\r\n  at a Book; my Mother regarding more the Beauty of my Face, than\r\n  the Improvement of my Mind; neither was I allowed to learn to\r\n  read: This Restraint, as it generally happens, made me but more\r\n  earnest in the Pursuit of what I imagined must be so delightful.\r\n  Twenty times a Day have I been corrected, for asking what such\r\n  and such Letters spelt; my Mother used to tell me the Word,\r\n  accompanying it with a good Box on the Ear, which, I suppose,\r\n  imprinted it on my Mind.... I do assure you, it had this Effect\r\n  on me, that I never forgot what was once told me; and quickly\r\n  arrived at my desired Happiness, being able to read before she\r\n  thought I knew all my Letters; but this Pleasure I was obliged to\r\n  enjoy by Stealth with Fear and Trembling.\r\n\r\n  I was at this Time about five Years of Age; and my Mother being\r\n  one Day abroad, I had happily laid hold on _Alexander's Feast_\r\n  and found something in it so charming, that I read it aloud; but\r\n  how like a condemned Criminal did I look, when my Father, softly\r\n  opening his Study-door, took me in the very Fact; I dropt my Book\r\n  and burst into Tears, begging Pardon and promising never to do\r\n  so again: But my Sorrow was soon dispelled, when he bade me not\r\n  to be frightened, but read to him, which to his great Surprize,\r\n  I did very distinctly, and without hurting the Beauty of the\r\n  Numbers. Instead of the whipping, of which I stood in dread,\r\n  he took me up in his Arms, and kissed me, giving me a whole\r\n  Shilling, as a Reward, and told me, \"He would give me another as\r\n  soon as I got a Poem by Heart,\" which he put into my Hand, and\r\n  proved to be Mr. Pope's sacred Eclogue; which Task I performed\r\n  before my Mother returned Home. They were both astonished at my\r\n  Memory, and from that Day forward, I was permitted to read as\r\n  much as I pleased; only my Father took care to furnish me with\r\n  the best, and politest Authors; and took Delight in explaining to\r\n  me, whatever, by Reason of my tender Years, was above my Capacity\r\n  of Understanding.\r\n\r\n  But chiefly was I charmed and ravished with the Sweets of Poetry;\r\n  all my Hours were dedicated to the Muses; and, from a Reader, I\r\n  quickly became a Writer; I may truly say with Mr. _Pope_,\r\n\r\n      _I lisp'd in Numbers, for the Numbers came._\r\n\r\n  My Performances had the good Fortune to be looked on as\r\n  extraordinary for my Years; and the greatest and wisest Men in\r\n  the Kingdom did not disdain to hear the Prattle of the little\r\n  Muse, as they called me, even in my Childish Days. But as I\r\n  approached towards Womanhood a new Scene opened to me; and by the\r\n  Time I had looked on thirteen Years, I had almost as many Lovers.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen Lætitia married a penniless Irish parson, Mr. Matthew\r\nPilkington. Soon after their marriage they became well known in\r\nthe Dublin literary set. Constantia Grierson who was the first to\r\ncongratulate Lætitia on her marriage, and who witnessed the cruel\r\ntreatment the couple received from Mrs. Van Lewen, introduced them\r\nto Dr. Delany who befriended them. Through Dr. Delany they met\r\nSwift, who was much taken by the \"little poetical parson and his\r\nlittler poetical wife.\" He called them \"The Mighty Thomas Thumb\r\nand her Serene Highness of Lilliput,\"[332] and for a short time\r\nthey were evidently much at the deanery. The most famous portions\r\nof her _Memoirs_ have to do with Swift. His early biographers were\r\napparently unwilling to own how much of their vivid, picturesque\r\nmaterial came from a source so little esteemed, but Mr. Craik credits\r\nMrs. Pilkington with \"a picture of the Dean which is probably more\r\ntrue to the life than many that are more pretentious.\"[333] The young\r\nlady's wit, vivacity, courage, and independent mind brought a new\r\nand piquant element into Swift's life. He scolded her till she fled\r\nin tears, but at his imperious summons she always came back in new,\r\nadoring subjection. On one occasion, after an exceptionally severe\r\ncastigation, he wrote sharply but with an underlying compliment: \"You\r\nmust shake off the Leavings of your Sex. If you cannot keep a Secret,\r\nand take a Chiding, you will quickly be out of my Sphere. Corrigible\r\nPeople are to be chid; those who are otherwise, may be very safe\r\nfrom any Lectures of mine: I should rather choose to indulge them in\r\ntheir Follies, than attempt to set them right.\"[334] Usually her wit\r\ncould turn an impending quarrel into some sort of gay banter. On one\r\noccasion Swift began to reprimand her for having copied out one of\r\nhis manuscript poems. But she interrupted, saying she did not copy\r\nit, but knew it by heart from one reading. Whereupon there ensued a\r\nmemory contest. The test given her was from Shakespeare, all of whose\r\nworks she said she could repeat. \"The Line he first gave me, he had\r\npurposely picked out for its Singular Oddness: _But_ [sic] _rancours\r\nin the Vessel of my Peace_. Macbeth. I readily went on with the whole\r\nSpeech, and did so several times, that he tried me with the different\r\nPlays. The Dean then took down _Hudibras_, and ordered me to examine\r\nhim in it, as he had done me in _Shakespeare_; and, to my great\r\nsurprize, I found he remembered every Line from Beginning to End of\r\nit.\"[335]\r\n\r\nWhen Swift first saw little Mrs. Pilkington as a bride he exclaimed,\r\n\"What, this poor little Child married! God help her, she is early in\r\nTrouble.\"[336] The words were prophetic, for the troubles began very\r\nsoon. They were engendered by literary jealousy, for Mr. Pilkington\r\nwas a poet on his own account. Compliments to the wife became as\r\nwormwood to the husband, especially when such compliments were\r\naccompanied by frank depreciation of his own talents. Swift once put\r\na question to Mrs. Pilkington and received her answer. Mr. Pilkington\r\nthen entered the room and was asked the same question and gave an\r\nunsatisfactory answer. \"P-x on you for a Dunce,\" said the Dean. \"Were\r\nyour Wife and you to sit for a Fellowship, I would give her one,\r\nsooner than admit you a Sizar.\" From that time on Mr. Pilkington\r\nviewed his wife \"with scornful yet with jealous eyes.\"[337]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the two wrote odes in imitation of Horace.\r\nAngered at her success Mr. Pilkington told her that a Needle was more\r\nbecoming to a Woman's Hand than a Pen, and was placated only when the\r\nlady consigned her own ode to the flames and highly praised his. Her\r\ncomment is: \"And here let me seriously advise every Lady, who has\r\nthe Misfortune to be poetically turned, never to marry a Poet.... If\r\na Man cannot bear his Friend should write, much less can he endure\r\nit in his Wife; it seems to set them too much on a Level with their\r\nLords and Masters; and this I take to be the true Reason why even\r\nMen of Sense discountenance Learning in Women, and commonly choose\r\nfor Mates the most illiterate and stupid of the Sex; and bless their\r\nStars their Wife is not a Wit.\"[338] Jealousy was, however, the least\r\nof Mr. Pilkington's faults. He soon proved himself \"the arrantest\r\nrogue in England.\" The action he brought against his wife for divorce\r\nwas not sustained by the courts, but the outcome of it was that he\r\nabandoned her and her two children, and she was left penniless. She\r\nwent to London where she lived a life compounded of misfortunes and\r\nmisdemeanors.\r\n\r\nIn the _Memoirs_ she gives _in extenso_ the various expedients\r\nwhereby she tried to get a living. One of the most successful was as\r\na public letter-writer for which she issued the following card:\r\n\r\n  _Letters written here on any Subject, except on the Law, Price\r\n  Twelvepence; Petitions also Drawn at the same Rate. Mem. Ready\r\n  Money, no Trust._[339]\r\n\r\nUnder cover of getting subscriptions for the _Memoirs_, she really\r\nlived on the charities of the charitable and what she euphemistically\r\ntermed \"contributions from the great.\" Colley Cibber[340] especially\r\nbefriended her and urged her to push forward the _Memoirs_. But\r\nspite of all aid her course was downward. At one time she was even\r\nimprisoned for debt.[341] On her release she tried to keep a print\r\nand pamphlet shop,[342] but failed. And finally she wandered back to\r\nDublin where she died at thirty-eight.\r\n\r\nThe one book by which Mrs. Pilkington is known is her _Memoirs_, the\r\nthree volumes of which appeared in 1748. In 1754 a third edition\r\nappeared with an additional volume by her son. Shortly after her\r\ndeath there appeared a compilation entitled _The Celebrated Mrs.\r\nPilkington's Jests; or, The Cabinet of Wit and Humour_. In the\r\n_Memoirs_ the early happy life in Dublin and the later tricks\r\nand shifts and intrigues of the London life are described with\r\nequal frankness. The result was a tarnished fame as a woman, but\r\nan undisputed reputation as a clever writer. When the Earl of\r\nChesterfield wondered that she could write English so well, she sent\r\nword to his lordship that Dr. Swift had been her tutor.\r\n\r\nAs a literary critic Mrs. Pilkington is especially severe on the\r\nimmorality of some contemporary women writers. Speaking of a lady who\r\nhad refused to subscribe to her book she said:\r\n\r\n  She would have purchased my Book sooner than the Bible, to\r\n  indulge her private Meditations, Especially if I had the wicked\r\n  Art of painting up Vice in attractive Colours, as too many of\r\n  our Female Writers have done, to the Destruction of Thousands,\r\n  amongst whom Mrs. Manly and Mrs. Haywood deserve the foremost\r\n  Rank.\r\n\r\n  But what extraordinary Passions these Ladies may have\r\n  experienced, I know not; far be such Knowledge from a Modest\r\n  Woman: Indeed Mrs. _Haywood_ seems to have dropped her former\r\n  luscious Stile, and, for Variety presents us with the insipid:\r\n  Her _Female Spectators_ are a Collection of trite Stories,\r\n  delivered to us in stale and worn-out Phrases: Bless'd Revolution!\r\n\r\n      _Yet of the two, less dang'rous is th' Offence_\r\n      _To tire the Patience, than mislead the Sense._\r\n\r\n  And here give me leave to observe, that amongst the Ladies that\r\n  have taken up the Pen, I never met with but two who deserved the\r\n  Name of a _Writer_; the first is Madam _Dacier_, whose Learning\r\n  Mr. Pope, while he is indebted to her for all the notes on\r\n  _Homer_, endeavoured to depreciate; the second is Mrs. Catherine\r\n  Philips, the matchless _Orinda_, celebrated by Mr. _Cowley_, Lord\r\n  _Orrery_, and all the Men of Genius who lived in her Time.\r\n\r\n  I think this incomparable Lady was one of the first Refiners of\r\n  the _English_ Numbers. I cannot, except my own Country-woman\r\n  _Mrs. Grierson_, find out another female Writer, whose Works are\r\n  worth reading; she indeed had a happy and well-improved Genius!\r\n\r\nThe last glimpse we have of Mrs. Pilkington is most effective in the\r\ndramatic contrast it presents. On Thursday, April 12, 1750, John\r\nWesley wrote in his Dublin Diary: \"I breakfasted with one of the\r\nSociety, and found she had a lodger I little thought of. It was the\r\nfamous Mrs. Pilkington, who soon made an excuse for following me up\r\nstairs. I talked with her seriously about an hour: we then sung,\r\n'Happy Magdalene.' She appeared to be exceedingly struck: how long\r\nthe impression may last, God knows.\"[343]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Mary Davys (fl. 1725)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Davys wrote a comedy produced at Lincoln's Inn Fields in\r\n1716, and a didactic novel, _The Reform'd Coquet_, which appeared\r\nin 1724. Her _Works_, in two volumes, appeared in 1725. Miss Morgan\r\nsays that the young lord who is the hero of _The Reform'd Coquet_,\r\nis one of the earliest examples in fiction of \"the perfect prig of\r\nwhich Sir Charles Grandison is the consummate example.\"[344] She was\r\nthe wife of the Reverend Peter Davys, master of the free school of\r\nSt. Patrick's, Dublin, so she came into the circle of Swift. Dr. Ewen\r\nof Cambridge formerly had thirty-six letters from Swift to Mr. and\r\nMrs. Davys. Mr. Davys died in 1698 and Mrs. Davys was \"left to her\r\nown endeavours.\" In 1713 she wrote to Swift complaining that he had\r\nnot written to her for four years. \"I have honestly told her,\" he\r\nsaid, \"it was my way never to write to those whom I am never likely\r\nto see, unless I can serve them, which I cannot her, etc. Davis the\r\nschoolmaster's widow.\"[345] She was not so fortunate as Mrs. Grierson\r\nand Mrs. Pilkington.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Mary Mitchell Collyer (1716?-1762?)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Collyer's publications were anonymous and she has been hardly\r\nmore than a name in literary history. Recent investigations have,\r\nhowever, shown her to be of genuine importance, not merely as a\r\nwriter of considerable ability, but especially as an author in whom\r\nromantic tendencies found early and well-defined statement.[346]\r\nMrs. Collyer was the wife of Joseph Collyer, a compiler, translator,\r\nand publisher to whom her books have sometimes been attributed. Her\r\nson was Joseph Collyer, an engraver of merit. Mr. Collyer's income\r\nwas apparently small, for Mrs. Collyer wrote for the support of her\r\nfamily. In the Dedication to her _Death of Abel_ she said: \"Placed\r\nby the hand of Providence at an humble distance from the Great, my\r\ncares and pleasures are concentrated within the narrow limits of my\r\nlittle family, and it is in order to contribute to the support and\r\neducation of my children, I have taken up my pen.\"\r\n\r\nThe seven works attributed to Mrs. Collyer fall between 1743 and\r\n1763. It is unnecessary to consider these works here in detail except\r\nso far as may serve to indicate their historical significance.\r\nFor this purpose we may take up first the last of her books, the\r\ntranslations from the German, for it is on these that her modicum\r\nof fame has rested. When Mrs. Collyer translated Gesner's _Der Tod\r\nAbels_ in 1761 and began Klopstock's _Messiah_ the year after, she\r\nwas a pioneer in a new kind of learning. The professed linguists\r\nseldom included German in their list, and German literature was\r\npractically unknown.[347] Mr. Haney, in his study of \"German\r\nLiterature in England before 1790,\" gives William Taylor of Norwich\r\nas \"the first literary critic to attempt a systematic introduction of\r\nGerman literature into England,\" and Mr. Taylor's period of literary\r\nactivity did not begin until 1790. Of the sporadic translations\r\nbefore that period, aside from scientific and theological works and a\r\nfew hymns, Mr. Haney cites but two anterior to Mrs. Collyer's _Death\r\nof Abel_. There were few more popular works in the eighteenth century\r\nthan this translation. There were eighteen editions in twenty-one\r\nyears, and many later editions. It satisfied alike the pious reader\r\nand the lover of fiction. _The Quarterly Review_ for 1814[348] says:\r\n\"No book of foreign growth has ever become so popular in England as\r\nthe Death of Abel. Those publishers whose market lies among that\r\nportion of the people who are below what is called the public, but\r\nform a far more numerous class, include it regularly among their\r\n'sacred classics': it has been repeatedly printed at country presses\r\nwith worn types and on coarse paper; and it is found at country\r\nfairs, and in the little shops of remote towns almost as certainly\r\nas the Pilgrim's Progress and Robinson Crusoe.\" Miss Hughes quotes\r\nnumerous other testimonies to the same effect.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable popularity was due, of course, to the original author\r\nrather than to the translator. Mrs. Collyer's version received high\r\ncontemporary praise, but according to modern ideas it would be\r\ncounted loose and inaccurate. Miss Reed characterizes the style as\r\nunnatural and affected, and she thinks that while the translation\r\nmade Gesner widely known, it in reality injured his fame. But the\r\nexcellence of the work, or its defects, are not so significant in a\r\nstudy of Mrs. Collyer as are the facts that she was sufficiently well\r\ntrained in German to give even a fairly adequate version, and that\r\nshe should be the first to present a German poet of the new school to\r\nan English public.\r\n\r\nMrs. Collyer died before completing her translation of Klopstock and\r\nher husband carried it to a conclusion. He said in his Preface that\r\nhis wife's fatal illness was brought on by her agitation of mind in\r\nconnection with her work on the _Death of Abel_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Collyer's _Christmas Box_ is another instance of pioneer work.\r\nIts full descriptive title is _A Christmas Box, Consisting of Moral\r\nStories, adapted to the Capacities of Little Children and calculated\r\nto give them early impressions of Piety and Virtue. Two volumes.\r\nAdorned with cuts._ The _Christmas Box_ and Miss Fielding's _Little\r\nFemale Academy_ appeared in 1749, five years after Newbery's first\r\nchild's book, _The Little Pretty Pocket Book_, of 1744. In 1745\r\nhe brought out three volumes of _The Circles of the Sciences_,\r\nand in 1751-52 _The Lilliputian Magazine_. Thus a new class of\r\nliterature was definitely started, with Mrs. Collyer and Miss\r\nFielding as important contributors to the spread of the idea at its\r\ninception.[349]\r\n\r\nTwo of Mrs. Collyer's novels are translations from the French, and\r\nare of slight importance in comparison with her one original novel\r\nthe full title of which is _Felicia to Charlotte: Being Letters\r\nfrom a Young Lady in the Country, to her Friend in Town. Containing\r\nA Series of the most interesting Events, interspersed with Moral\r\nReflections; chiefly tending to prove that the Seeds of Virtue are\r\nimplanted in the Mind of Every Reasonable Being._ Volume one appeared\r\nin 1744 and a second volume in 1749. Miss Hughes in her analysis of\r\nthis novel[350] points out various elements that forecast ideas not\r\ndominant till some decades later. It was a novel of purpose, written\r\nfor ethical and religious ends, and as such antedates _John Buncle_\r\nby twelve years. It is also a novel of feeling. Its hero, Lucius,\r\nmust wait for Sterne before he can find his true kin. The courtship\r\nof Lucius is punctuated with sighs and tears, with the overwrought\r\nemotions of a sensitive heart. Steele's _Conscious Lovers_ offers an\r\nearly sentimental parallel, but the type was not fully developed till\r\nin the seventies. The first volume ends with the marriage of Felicia\r\nand Lucius. In the second volume the happy pair, now quite sane and\r\nsensible, are able to discuss with fluency and precision their ideas\r\non the nurture and education of children. This volume was thus a\r\npedagogic romance of the sort that became popular after Rousseau.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of all the new ideas brought forward by Felicia\r\nand Lucius is their love of nature and of country life. They choose\r\nthe country as a place of residence and justify their choice on\r\nrational grounds. And Mrs. Collyer has a surprising fullness and\r\nardor of description, and a sincere joy in nature not equaled\r\nin fiction before _John Buncle_ (1756-66), and she is a decade\r\nearlier.[351] It was only in poetry or in philosophical theory that\r\nMrs. Collyer could have found sources for her literary use of\r\nnature. Spenser, Milton, and Thomson were well known to her and they\r\ndoubtless influenced her.\r\n\r\nConnected with this love of nature are Mrs. Collyer's ideas on\r\ngardening. When she and Lucius bought their estate it was in the\r\nformal style, but they at once changed it to make it appear as much\r\nlike nature as possible. In this Mrs. Collyer was not entirely\r\noriginal, for the _Spectator_ and the _Guardian_, Pope, Switzer, and\r\nBatty Langley had decried the stiff regularity of the formal garden,\r\nand Kent's great gardens came between 1730 and 1748. But Mrs. Collyer\r\npromptly took up the new ideas and she ranks among their early\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nMrs. Collyer is very interesting because she showed herself in these\r\nvarious ways so sensitive to new ideas. She seemed to know what was\r\nin the air even before it had had any but the most casual expression.\r\nShe sat down very modestly and with much trepidation to write\r\nanonymous translations and novels for the support of her family, but\r\nshe was, quite unconsciously it may be, treading the path of the\r\npioneer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sarah Fielding (1710-1768)]\r\n\r\nSarah Fielding's first and most important novel, _The Adventures\r\nof David Simple in search of a Faithful Friend_ (1744), received\r\nextraordinary commendation from the two contemporary authors whose\r\njudgments might be counted authoritative, Henry Fielding and Samuel\r\nRichardson. Fielding's satiric picture of Mrs. Western in _Tom Jones_\r\nis more than offset by his utterances in connection with his sister\r\nSarah's books. When _David Simple_ appeared, _Joseph Andrews_ had\r\nbeen two years before the public, and it was natural that her popular\r\nlittle book should be attributed to Fielding. But when the second\r\nedition came out (also 1744) he took occasion to disavow his supposed\r\nauthorship, and likewise to commend the book.\r\n\r\n  A third, and indeed the strongest, reason which hath drawn me\r\n  into print, is to do justice to the real and sole author of this\r\n  little book; who, notwithstanding the many excellent observations\r\n  dispersed through it, and the deep knowledge of human nature it\r\n  discovers, is a young woman; one so nearly and dearly allied\r\n  to me, in the highest friendship as well as relation, that if\r\n  she had wanted any assistance of mine I would have been as ready\r\n  to have given it to her as I would have been just to my word in\r\n  owning it; but, in reality, two or three hints which arose on the\r\n  reading it, and some little direction as to the conduct of the\r\n  second volume, much the greater part of which I never saw till in\r\n  print, were all the aid she received from me. Indeed, I believe\r\n  there are few books in the world so absolutely the author's own\r\n  as this....\r\n\r\n  And as the faults of this work want very little excuse, so its\r\n  beauties want as little recommendation; though I will not say\r\n  but they may sometimes stand in need of being pointed out to the\r\n  generality of readers. For as the merit of this work consists\r\n  in a vast penetration into human nature, a deep and profound\r\n  discernment of all the mazes, windings, and labyrinths, which\r\n  perplex the heart of man to such a degree that he is himself\r\n  often incapable of seeing through them; and as this is the\r\n  greatest, noblest, and rarest of all the talents which constitute\r\n  a genius; so a much larger share of this talent is necessary even\r\n  to recognize these discoveries when they are laid before us than\r\n  fall to the share of a common reader....\r\n\r\n  As to the characters here described, I shall repeat the saying\r\n  of one of the greatest men in this age,--\"That they were as\r\n  wonderfully drawn by the writer as they were by Nature herself.\"\r\n  There are many strokes in Orguiel, Spatter, Varnish, Levif, the\r\n  Balancer, and some others which would have shined in the pages of\r\n  Theophrastus, Horace, or La Bruyère. Nay, there are some touches\r\n  which I will venture to say might have done honour to the pencil\r\n  of the immortal Shakespeare himself.[352]\r\n\r\nFor a continuation of _David Simple_ in 1747,[353] Fielding wrote a\r\ndedication and five letters. In this Preface he gave his opinion on\r\nlearning for women:\r\n\r\n  The objection to the sex of the author hardly requires an answer;\r\n  it will be chiefly advanced by those who derive their opinion of\r\n  women, very unfairly, from the fine ladies of the age; whereas,\r\n  if the behavior of their counterparts, the beaux, was to denote\r\n  the understanding of men, I apprehend the conclusion would be in\r\n  favour of the women, without making a compliment to that sex.\r\n  I can, of my own knowledge and from my own acquaintance, bear\r\n  testimony to the possibility of those examples which history\r\n  gives of women eminent for the highest endowments and faculties\r\n  of mind. I shall only add an answer to the same objection,\r\n  relating to David Simple, given by a lady of very high rank,\r\n  whose quality, is however, less an honour to her than her\r\n  understanding. \"So far,\" said she, \"from doubting David Simple to\r\n  be the performance of a woman, I am well convinced it could not\r\n  have been written by a man.\"[354]\r\n\r\nMiss Fielding's own views on the woman question are slightly\r\nindicated in this story. In the course of his peregrinations David\r\nSimple meets the charming Miss Cynthia, who tells him the story of\r\nher life and leads him to reflect upon the irritation and unhappiness\r\nwhich result from the undue restrictions imposed upon women. Miss\r\nCynthia had always been subject to repression. Whenever she asked\r\nquestions she was told, such things were not proper for girls of her\r\nage to know. She was not allowed to read, for Miss Cynthia must not\r\ninquire too far into things lest it should turn her brain. She was to\r\nmind her needlework and such things as are useful to women. Reading\r\nand poring over books would never get her a husband. Cynthia's\r\nrestlessness doubtless well represents the state of mind of many a\r\ncontemporary girl eager for learning, but not able to escape from the\r\nfeminine conventions.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 Miss Fielding published a work quite new in form and\r\nintention. It was entitled _The Governess; Or, The Little Female\r\nAcademy. Calculated for the Entertainment and Instruction of Young\r\nLadies in their Education._ It was so popular that a seventh edition\r\nappeared in 1760. This little book represents the happenings of nine\r\ndays in the school of Mrs. Teachum, a gentlewoman who taught young\r\nladies \"in Reading, Writing, Working, and in all proper Forms of\r\nBehavior.\" The oldest of her nine young ladies was fourteen, the\r\nyoungest was six, and the others between six and twelve. The book\r\nwas professedly written, not for the Mrs. Teachums of the age, but\r\nfor little girls under twelve. And the instruction embodied was\r\nthrown into story form to make it more acceptable to young readers.\r\nI know of no earlier similar attempt. Such books as had been\r\nwritten for children were serious and religious in tone. But Miss\r\nFielding's book was lively and entertaining. Each little girl told\r\nthe history of her life and analyzed her adventures and emotions,\r\nparticularly her faults and their outcome, in true romance style.\r\nBut all is kept pretty near to a child's understanding. And there\r\nare some occurrences--as a fracas in which the genteel young ladies\r\n\"fought and scratched and tore like young cats,\" for the possession\r\nof an apple redder and bigger than its companions in the basket, a\r\ncollation at a dairy farm, sewing-parties in an arbor with Miss Jenny\r\nPeace, the fourteen-year old girl, as story-teller and as umpire in\r\nall disputes, that must have had extraordinary charm for young misses\r\nwho had never before seen even a semblance of their own lives in\r\nprint.\r\n\r\nMiss Fielding's other works are of less significance except for her\r\ntranslation of _Xenophon's Memoirs of Socrates; with the Defence of\r\nSocrates before his Judges_ (1762), which indicates a knowledge of\r\nGreek more exact than was common in her day.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting fact in Miss Fielding's life is her close\r\nfriendship with Richardson. She was one of the most ardent admirers\r\nof his work. She says of Clarissa: \"When I read of her I am all\r\nsensation; my heart glows; I am overwhelmed; my only vent is\r\ntears.... Often have I reflected on my own vanity in daring but to\r\ntouch the hem of her garment.\" In 1756 Richardson wrote to her:\r\n\r\n  Why did you not tell Lady Bradshaigh ... that you were my\r\n  much-esteemed Sally Fielding, the author of David Simple? She\r\n  knows my opinion of you, and of your writing powers.... I have\r\n  just gone through your two vols. of Letters. Have re-perused them\r\n  with great pleasure, and found many new beauties in them. What\r\n  a knowledge of the human heart! Well might a critical judge of\r\n  writing say, as he did to me, that your late brother's knowledge\r\n  of it was not (fine writer as he was) comparable to yours. His\r\n  was but as the knowledge of the outside of a clock-work machine,\r\n  while your's was that of all the finer springs and movements of\r\n  the inside.[355]\r\n\r\nThe most popular work by Miss Fielding was _The Little Female\r\nAcademy_. _David Simple_, to be sure, went through two editions in\r\n1744. But the indications of contemporary recognition are not at all\r\ncommensurate with the praise from her brother and Richardson and\r\nother high authorities. Of foreign appreciation of her work there\r\nare more proofs. _David Simple_ was translated into German[356] in\r\n1746 and into French in 1755,[357] and _The Countess of Gräfin_ was\r\ntranslated into German in 1761.[358] The French translator of _David\r\nSimple_ commented on the _approbation générale_ which this romance\r\nhad found.[359]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charlotte Lennox (1720-1804)]\r\n\r\nCharlotte Rumsey was the daughter of Colonel James Rumsey,\r\nLieutenant-Governor of New York. At fifteen she was sent to England\r\nas the protégé and probable heiress of an aunt. But the aunt became\r\ninsane, and the girl was left penniless. The only facts that emerge\r\nconcerning the difficult years before her marriage to Mr. Lennox in\r\nabout 1748 have to do with her very mediocre career as an actress.\r\n\r\nExcept for a volume of poems in 1747, it was not till after her\r\nmarriage that Mrs. Lennox came forward prominently as an author. Her\r\ntwo-volume novel, _The Life of Harriet Stuart, Written by Herself_,\r\nappeared in 1751. But in literary circles she was evidently well\r\nknown before this, for Johnson was her especial friend. When her\r\nmanuscript was ready for publication, he arranged a celebration at\r\nhis Club. The festivities were to last all night. Mrs. Lennox was\r\nceremoniously crowned with laurel, and there was a magnificent hot\r\napple-pie stuck with bay leaves.[360] This first novel is probably\r\nin part autobiographical inasmuch as the heroine, Harriet Stuart,\r\nis the daughter of a man of high official rank in America, and goes\r\nto England at fifteen to live with an aunt who becomes insane and\r\nleaves her penniless. But this is merely a slight framework for\r\na series of love adventures. Miss Stuart's wit and beauty gather\r\nabout her lovers of all varieties, army officers, sea-captains,\r\npirates, merchants; and the alarming crises of her fate put her\r\ninto close competition with Clarissa Harlowe herself. America,\r\nFrance, and England are the far-separated scenes of Miss Stuart's\r\ntrials and victories, the emphasis being on her life in America.\r\nThere would be a chance for some interesting local color in this\r\nrepresentation of mid-eighteenth-century life in New York if the\r\nyoung lady could have spared a moment from her adventures to observe\r\nher surroundings. An Indian encampment, a visit to a fort, an\r\nescapade to a \"farm,\" a midnight row on the Hudson, are mentioned,\r\nbut with no comment. Towns and houses, roads, rivers, and seas, are\r\nbut localities for love scenes, means of transit from one episode\r\nto another. The story is told with a deft manipulation of details\r\nand an easy fluency that would seem to indicate something of a\r\nprevious literary apprenticeship. At any rate, in this novel she had\r\nfound her medium, and she was soon ready with a tale that gave her\r\ngenuine distinction. _The Female Quixote_ appeared in 1752 with a\r\nDedication written by Johnson, and it was reviewed by him in _The\r\nGentleman's Magazine_ for March. He said of it: \"Mr. Fielding,\r\nhowever emulous of Cervantes, and jealous of a rival, acknowledges\r\nin his paper of the 24th, that in many instances, this copy excels\r\nthe original, and though he has no connection with the author, he\r\nconcludes his encomium on the work, by earnestly recommending it as\r\na most extraordinary, and most excellent performance. 'It is,' says\r\nhe, 'a work of true humour, and cannot fail of giving a rational, as\r\nwell as a very pleasing amusement, to a sensible reader, who will\r\nat once be instructed, and highly diverted.'\"[361] Johnson's name\r\nis still more intimately connected with the book, for he wrote the\r\nchapter which has the heading, \"Being in the author's opinion, the\r\nbest chapter in this history.\"[362] _Harriet Stuart_ reads like an\r\necho of Richardson, but in _The Female Quixote_ Mrs. Lennox strikes\r\nan original note. Comedy had already, a generation earlier, in Biddy\r\nTipkin, made sport of the romance-reading girls of the day. But the\r\nsatire was new in fiction. And it was carried out with a fullness\r\nand accuracy of details possible only to one who had herself been a\r\ntraveler in enchanted realms. Mrs. Lennox must at some time have been\r\nas devoted to French fiction as even Dorothy Osborne and Mrs. Pepys\r\nin the preceding century. Her story is long-drawn-out and improbable,\r\nbut the cleverness with which Arabella and Lucy parody Don Quixote\r\nand Sancho Panza gives the book a notable place among the English\r\nfollowers of Cervantes. _The Spiritual Quixote_ (1773), a satire on\r\nthe Methodists, and _The Benevolent Quixote_ (1791), a satire on\r\nmawkish ideas of charity, are inferior in vivacity and interest to\r\nMrs. Lennox's work.\r\n\r\nIn 1753-54 Mrs. Lennox brought out _Shakespeare Illustrated; or,\r\nNovels and Histories on which the Plays are ... founded, collected\r\nand translated_, an uncritical piece of work according to present\r\nstandards, but historically significant as one of the earliest\r\nattempts to present Shakespeare's sources.[363] A two-volume novel,\r\n_Henrietta_, in 1758, was dramatized as a didactic comedy under\r\nthe title _The Sister_,[364] and brought out at Covent Garden in\r\n1769. Though Miss Mattocks played the chief part, and the Prologue\r\nand Epilogue were respectively by Colman and Goldsmith, the play\r\nmet with but moderate success. In 1760-61 Mrs. Lennox edited _The\r\nLadies Museum_, in which were illustrated articles on natural\r\nhistory written especially for ladies, philosophical discussions\r\nsimplified for ladies, and continued stories of the love-adventure\r\ntype evidently calculated for the same tastes. The most interesting\r\ncharacter drawing is that of an incipient Mrs. Malaprop in the person\r\nof a Mrs. Gibbons.\r\n\r\nIf any annals were extant of Mrs. Lennox's life we should doubtless\r\nfind records of continuous study. At least we constantly get new\r\nproofs of her learning. _The Memoirs of M. de Bethune, Duke of\r\nSully_, in three volumes in 1756,[365] _The Memoirs of the Countess\r\nBerci_, in two volumes in the same year, and _Memoirs for the History\r\nof Madame de Maintenon_, in 1757, show not only her mastery of\r\nFrench, but very steady application to intellectual tasks. In 1759\r\nshe had what might be considered her crowning honor as a learned\r\nlady. She was chosen to edit a translation of Brumoy's _Greek\r\nTheatre_. In collaboration with her were Dr. Johnson, Dr. Gregory\r\nSharpe, Dr. Grainger, and John Bourrya, men of recognized standing as\r\nscholars.[366]\r\n\r\nMrs. Lennox lived forty-four years after the close of the period\r\nunder discussion. But she belongs properly in the first half of\r\nthe century because all her important work comes between 1750 and\r\n1760. After a decade of exceptional literary activity she sinks\r\ninto obscurity. In 1775 Dr. Johnson assisted in preparing proposals\r\nfor the publication of her collected works, in three quarto\r\nvolumes, by subscription. Had this plan been carried out there\r\nwould doubtless have been preserved much interesting information\r\nconcerning the social and literary life of an eminently successful\r\nmid-eighteenth-century _bas bleu_. From the facts at hand it is easy\r\nto see that she was countenanced by some of the best minds of her\r\ntime. Her portrait was painted by Reynolds and engraved by Bartolozzi.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miss Catharine Talbot (1721-1770)]\r\n\r\nIn 1770 Miss Elizabeth Carter gathered together and published\r\nthe _Works_ of her friend Miss Catharine Talbot. There had been\r\nconsiderable urgency on the part of Miss Talbot's friends to secure\r\nsuch a publication during her lifetime, but she was too timid, and,\r\nthough _The Green Book_ in which she kept sketches and fragments,\r\nand \"the considering drawer,\" constantly received accessions, her\r\nmodest opinion of her own worth and an exaggerated dread of general\r\ncriticism held her back from the ordeal of the printed page. But when\r\nthe _Works_ finally appeared they achieved immediate popularity.\r\nThe _Reflections on the Seven Days of the Week_ went through three\r\neditions the first year and there was a tenth edition in 1784. Of\r\nthe _Works_ the eighth edition appeared within forty years. The\r\nextravagant contemporary estimate of Miss Talbot as a moral and\r\nreligious writer, as a supporter of Christian ethics, can awake only\r\nsurprise in the modern reader. Even a reader whose mind has been\r\nsubdued to second-class eighteenth-century didacticism finds Miss\r\nTalbot's moralizings pale and anæmic. But when we read her letters\r\nwe come upon a much more attractive and vital personality. A letter\r\ndescriptive of Mr. Browne Willis and his four daughters shows a gay\r\nspirit and a talent for minute observation and social satire of the\r\nJane Austen type.[367]\r\n\r\nFrom the age of five Miss Talbot lived in the family of Mr.\r\nSeeker, Bishop of Oxford and later Archbishop of Canterbury. Her\r\nspiritual and mental training were constantly under the supervision\r\nof the Archbishop, who loved her devotedly. And her education is\r\nparticularly interesting as an illustration of the desultory and\r\nfragmentary character of the intellectual discipline provided for a\r\ngirl of active mind, even in one of the best families. One advantage\r\nwas hers from early life, and that was her association with the\r\nlearned guests at the deanery where there was always an atmosphere\r\nof scholarly and serious discussion. And her position as a member\r\nof the Archbishop's family not only gave her entrance into the best\r\nsocial circles, but made it incumbent on her, as hostess or guest, to\r\ncultivate the amenities of life. But she did comparatively little in\r\nthe way of exact studies. She was proficient in French and Italian,\r\nbut she knew no Hebrew or Greek and but little Latin. She had tutors\r\nin geography and astronomy and found satisfaction in the conceptions\r\nopened up to her by these subjects. Of her drawing and painting for\r\nwhich she had considerable repute she wrote in 1745:\r\n\r\n  I learn of a good master but am much too impatient and too\r\n  volatile to give half the time and application that are necessary\r\n  to make anything tolerable, yet I undertake large pictures, like\r\n  an inconsiderate goose as I am, and then have the mortification\r\n  to leave them unfinished. This is actually the case with a fine\r\n  holy family of Carlo Maratti's, which I began last winter (and\r\n  two or three other pictures at the same time) in crayons, and\r\n  which must now want the perfecting touches till February or\r\n  March. At the same time I had undertaken to learn perspective of\r\n  Mr. Wright. I hope from all these things I shall in time learn\r\n  discretion at least, and not to be thus perpetually aiming _de\r\n  prendre la lune avec les dents_.[368]\r\n\r\nThis letter was written when she was twenty-five. A _Dialogue_\r\nwritten at eighteen gives an earlier glimpse of her chaotic student\r\nlife. This _Dialogue_ is entitled \"Enquiry how far Practice has kept\r\npace with Intention.\"\r\n\r\n  What have you done, this Summer?\r\n\r\n  Rode, and laughed, and fretted.\r\n\r\n  What did you intend to do?\r\n\r\n  To learn geography, mathematics; decimal fractions and good\r\n  humour: to work a screen, draw copies of two or three fine\r\n  prints, and read abundance of history: to improve my memory and\r\n  restrain my fancy: to lay out my time to the best advantage: to\r\n  be happy myself, and make everybody else so. To read Voltaire's\r\n  Newton, Whiston's Euclid, and Tillotson's Sermons.\r\n\r\n  Have you read nothing?\r\n\r\n  Yes: some of the Sermons; Mrs. Rowe's Works; The Tale of a Tub; a\r\n  book of Dr. Watt's; L'Histoire du Ciel; Milton, and abundance of\r\n  plays and idle books.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Secker's household presents an agreeable picture of\r\nlettered leisure. During the evenings there are long sessions known\r\nas \"the family readings.\" In 1751 they are reading Pope's _Works_,\r\nevidently in the recent nine-volume edition by Warburton. They are\r\nfilled with mingled pride and shame as they reflect on his genius and\r\nhis failings. They have read Mrs. Cockburn's defense of him and they\r\nlove her for her zealous championship. But Pope is not their idol.\r\nAll their hero worship, at least all of Miss Talbot's hero worship,\r\ngoes to Richardson. She cannot subscribe to any criticism of him. In\r\na discussion of one of his essays in _The Rambler_, Miss Carter's\r\nstrictures bring a spirited protest from Miss Talbot:\r\n\r\n  He does not pretend to give a scheme (not an entire scheme)\r\n  of female education, only to say how when well educated they\r\n  should behave, in opposition to the racketing life of the\r\n  Ranelagh-education misses of these our days. Do read it over\r\n  again a little candidly. How can you ever imagine that the author\r\n  of Clarissa has not an idea of what women may be, and ought to be.\r\n\r\nRichardson and Miss Talbot were personal friends and he thought\r\nso highly of her judgment that when he contemplated creating the\r\ncharacter of a perfect gentleman as the hero of _Sir Charles\r\nGrandison_, he consulted her concerning the traits of this superman.\r\nShe in turn consulted Miss Carter, and when the book appeared she\r\nwrote to Miss Carter in great glee:\r\n\r\n  Oh! Miss Carter, did you ever call Pigmalion a fool, for making\r\n  an image and falling in love with it ... and do you know that\r\n  you and I are two Pigmalionesses? Did not Mr. Richardson ask us\r\n  for some traits of his good man's character? And did we not give\r\n  him some? And has not he gone and put these and his own charming\r\n  ideas into a book and formed a Sir Charles Grandison?\r\n\r\nBeside the evening readings there were leisurely literary picnics,\r\nwhere by some riverside they drank tea and read Madame de Sévigné's\r\n_Letters_ and Miss Fielding. They read Mrs. Cockburn and Mrs. Jones,\r\nand Mrs. Lennox, even the _Memoirs_ of Mrs. Constantia Phillips, and\r\nthe early verse of Miss Mulso. There is time for slow and meditative\r\nreading, and for interested comment and question, back and forth, by\r\nletter. It was a normal, unpretentious, and stimulating way to gain\r\nan acquaintance with contemporary literature. And the great classics\r\nwere read, in translations, in the same manner. To read with a\r\nlearned man like Archbishop Secker was in itself an education.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that Miss Talbot had all the environment of education\r\nwith none of its disciplinary work. By twenty she was known as \"the\r\ncelebrated Miss Talbot\" without any basis of actual achievement. She\r\nseems to have embodied an eighteenth-century ideal. Her religious\r\nbeliefs were beyond cavil, her conduct irreproachable. She had an\r\nalert mind, wide interests, and considerable information on varied\r\ntopics. She had a high social rank, and she recognized social\r\nobligations. She was affable, approachable, attentive. She had enough\r\nlearning to give her distinction, but not enough even to threaten\r\npedantry. And she exerted all her talents in home and church circles.\r\nShe was not a Lætitia Pilkington writing scandal for daily bread,\r\nnor a Mary Astell protesting against the tyranny of man, nor an\r\nElizabeth Elstob delving in unfashionable research. She awakened no\r\nantagonisms. She had the success and happiness that come from being\r\nentirely in accord with one's environment.[369]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mary Leapor (1722-1746)]\r\n\r\nA few mediocre poetesses at the end of the period may be cursorily\r\nnoticed because in their own day they attracted some attention. In\r\n_Poems by Eminent Ladies_ Mary Leapor (1722-1746)[370] is given more\r\nspace than any other author. And in these decorous pages she stands\r\nout as a distinct individuality. She is the daughter of a gardener,\r\nbut no such elegant creature as Tennyson's Rose. She has work to do\r\nindoors and out, and her life is eminently prosaic. She has a plain\r\nface, an awkward figure, and non-descript clothes. But she has no\r\nquarrel with fate or her mirror. She seems to have been a shrewd,\r\nsensible young woman, vivacious, quick-witted, with no illusions, no\r\nsentimentality, no dreams. In her minor fashion she was a satirist of\r\nthe Pope school. Of the seventeen books in the little library she had\r\npainfully gathered, the ones she valued most were by Pope and Dryden.\r\nShe manages the heroic couplet with considerable correctness and ease\r\nand she follows Pope's method of illustrating a topic with verse\r\nportraits. Her closely studied country scenes suggest that Gay's\r\n_Shepherd's Week_ must have been among her books. Considering her\r\nyouth and contracted way of life, she had a remarkable insight into\r\nsocial foibles, but she had none of Swift's scorn of the human race\r\nnor of Pope's personal virulence. Her outlook on life was detached,\r\ntolerant, and amused.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miss Mary Jones (fl. 1755)]\r\n\r\nIn 1755, when Miss Mary Jones was included in _Eminent Ladies_, she\r\nwas still living, and therefore the date of her birth was not given.\r\nBut the editorial comment says that Oxford was her home, and \"hence\r\ndeservedly called the Seat of the Muses.\" Miss Jones corresponded\r\nwith a maid of honor, had many intimacies among the nobility, and\r\nrejoiced in the friendship of Her Royal Highness, the Princess\r\nof Orange. Her poems had, therefore, especial opportunities to\r\nmake their way. But the modest author long resisted the suggested\r\npublication of her works. She felt that these \"accidental ramblings\r\nof her thoughts into rhyme\" were of too slight value to be preserved\r\nin print. But she finally, in 1752, came forward with a volume\r\nwhich was greeted with high praise. _The Monthly Review_ for 1752\r\nbegan an Appreciation of her in the following flattering fashion:\r\n\"To the applauded names of the ingenious _Molly Leapor_, and the\r\ntruly admirable Mrs. _Cockburn_ (see Review, _the preceding volumes_)\r\nwe have now the pleasure to add that of Mrs. Jones; whose name\r\nwill not be less an honour to her country, and to the republic of\r\nletters, than her amiable life and manner are to her own sex: to\r\nthat sex whose natural charms alone are found sufficient to attract\r\nour tenderest regards; but which, when joined to those uncommon\r\naccomplishments and virtues this lady is mistress of, so justly\r\ncommand our highest admiration, and most ardent esteem.\" _The\r\nReview_ considers her compositions in verse as \"superior to those\r\nof any other of our female writers since _Catherine Phillips_\"\r\nand her prose as \"superior to any pieces of the kind that our own\r\ncountry has produced, from the pen of a woman.\" She was of a gay\r\nand vivacious temperament, and social by nature. Her interest in\r\nher friends' affairs brought forth many occasional poems. A spider\r\nfrightens Charlot, Mrs. East's canary bird dies, a hare is sent\r\nto Mrs. Clayton, Lady Beauclerk desires an elegy in memory of her\r\nhusband,--each incident receives poetical commemoration. Epistles on\r\n_Patience_, _Desire_, and _Hope_ are addressed to her friends among\r\nthe nobility.\r\n\r\nLike Miss Leapor she is a satellite of Pope. She has studied him to\r\nsuch effect that phrases and whole lines from his poems occur in\r\nher verse, and to the best of her ability she copies his style. Her\r\n_Epistle to Lady Bowyer_ is throughout curiously reminiscent of his\r\n_Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot_. Her verse essays are loosely constructed\r\namplifications of Pope's aphorism which she transforms into \"Whatever\r\nis, is Best.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mrs. Madan (fl. 1755)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Madan (\"formerly Miss Cowper\") was living in 1755. She was\r\nreputed to have fine talents for poetry, an \"extraordinary genius,\"\r\nin fact, but she could never be brought to publish any of her poems.\r\nShe is therefore known now only by her translation of Abelard's\r\nLetter to Eloisa, a kind of companion piece to Pope's _Eloisa to\r\nAbelard_. It is smooth, well-expressed, and shows some sympathetic\r\nunderstanding of Abelard's emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miss Mary Masters (fl. 1755)]\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Masters, a native of Ottley near Leeds in Yorkshire,\r\nhad an early taste for poetry, but she was \"always brow-beat and\r\ndiscountenanced by her parents.\"[371] The chief poems by her in\r\n_Eminent Ladies_ are trite paraphrases of the Psalms and need not\r\ndetain us.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 she brought out by subscription _Familiar Letters and Poems\r\non Several Occasions_. The letters between her as Maria and various\r\nfriends in 1755 are of considerable interest. The young ladies\r\ndiscuss, in the main, questions of love and marriage, but some\r\nletters at the end of the book concern themselves with the relative\r\npowers of men and women. \"Miss ----\" sustains the conventional view\r\nthat they differ fundamentally, men having more strength of judgment,\r\nand women quicker apprehension. She says that no woman has been great\r\nas an orator, that the best women poets are inferior to Milton, and\r\nthat men have always managed the government. Maria maintains that the\r\ndifference is not in the faculties themselves, but in the training of\r\nthe faculties and in opportunities for their use. She cites a young\r\nlady of twenty-two in France who had been admitted to the Academy\r\nof Science. And one entire letter is a eulogy of Italian learned\r\nladies. She gives the name of Clelia Borromeo of Milan, counted by\r\nthe Italians \"the greatest mathematician their country has produced,\r\nexcept Galileo and Manfredi\"; Gabriella Agnesi, also of Milan,\r\nskilled in algebraic computations; Countess Tullia Francesca Bizetti\r\nImbonati, a \"Lyrick Poetess,\" another Milanese lady; Laura Catterina\r\nBassi, Professor of Experimental Philosophy in the University of\r\nBologna, and many others. Maria is the earliest apologist for the\r\nadvancement of women to make such definite and intelligent use of\r\nthe learned Italian ladies as corroborative illustrations.[372]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Miss Mary Chandler (1687-1745)]\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Chandler (1687-1745), the daughter of a minister, was a\r\npopular poetess of Bath, where she had at eighteen set up a little\r\nshop. She was literary in her tastes and in spite of constant\r\nill-health and the hard work entailed by her shop she found time for\r\nwide reading in poetry. She also wrote rhyming riddles and poems to\r\nher friends. She became a favorite among the gentry and the literary\r\nladies in and about Bath, Lady Russell, the Duchess of Somerset, Mrs.\r\nBarber, and Elizabeth Rowe being among her friends. She often visited\r\nat great houses and her poems were handed about with much praise. She\r\nwas finally advised to make a collection of these occasional verses\r\nand publish them. They appeared under the title _A Description of\r\nBath_, and the book was so favorably received that it went through\r\nsix editions by 1744, and a seventh and an eighth edition in 1755\r\nand 1767. Our knowledge of Miss Chandler comes mainly from Cibber's\r\n_Lives of the Poets_. The account published by Cibber was written by\r\nMiss Chandler's brother Samuel.[373]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mary Granville (Mrs. Delany) (1700-1788)]\r\n\r\nMary Granville was sent at six to the private school of Mdlle.\r\nPuelle. From eight to seventeen she was educated at home according to\r\nthe established programme for girls destined for marriage and social\r\nposition. \"Music, reading, writing, French, work, and whist\" are the\r\noccupations she enumerates. At seventeen she was married to Alexander\r\nPendarves, a match counted advantageous though the bridegroom was\r\nsixty and detested by the bride. After the wedding--\"conducted with\r\nmuch pomp and misery\"--there came seven years on an isolated estate\r\nwhere all the skill and patience of the young wife were called into\r\naction by the jealous fancies and the hypochondriac whims of her\r\ninvalid husband. At twenty-four, a beautiful widow, she entered upon\r\na gay period of London life. Socially a success she had many offers\r\nof marriage, but her affections were entirely centered upon Lord\r\nBaltimore. His impassioned love was not, however, equal to the strain\r\nput upon it by her small dowry, and he suddenly married a rich wife.\r\nAfter the long illness that followed this destruction of her hopes\r\nMrs. Pendarves went to Ireland to recuperate. There she met Patrick\r\nDelany whom, years later, when she was forty-three, she married.\r\nThe most satisfying years of her life came after this marriage. Dr.\r\nDelany belonged to the best literary set of Dublin, and he was in\r\nfull accord with his wife's literary and artistic interests. For\r\na quarter of a century her life was one of leisure, stimulating\r\ncompanionship, much reading and discussion, much social variety, and\r\nlong hours of entertaining hand-work. After Dr. Delany's death in\r\n1768 Mrs. Delany lived in an honored, dignified, but not inactive\r\nretirement. She was loved and visited by the King and Queen and by\r\nmany devoted friends. There had gathered about her name a tradition\r\nof love and admiration. A sketch of her entitled \"Maria,\" by Dr.\r\nDelany, does not exceed the general impression we get of her charm.\r\nHe wrote:\r\n\r\n  Maria was early initiated into every art, with elegance and\r\n  condition, that could form her into a fine lady, a good woman,\r\n  and a good Christian. She read and wrote two languages correctly\r\n  and judiciously. She soon became a mistress of her pen in every\r\n  art to which a pen could be applied. She wrote a fine hand in the\r\n  most masterly manner, she drew, and she designed with amazing\r\n  correctness and skill....\r\n\r\n  With a person finely proportioned, she had a lovely face of great\r\n  sweetness set off with a head of fair hair, shining and naturally\r\n  curled, with a complexion which nothing could equal, in which the\r\n  lilies and the roses contended for the mastery. Her eyes were\r\n  bright ... indeed, I could never tell the colour they were of,\r\n  but to the best of my belief they were what Solomon calls \"Dove's\r\n  eyes,\" and she is almost the only woman I ever saw whose lips\r\n  were scarlet and her bloom beyond comparison.\r\n\r\nMr. Ballard dedicated the second part of the _Memoirs of Learned\r\nLadies_ to her as \"the truest judge, and the brightest pattern of\r\nall the accomplishments which adorn her sex.\" Burke called her \"the\r\nhighest bred woman of the world and the woman of fashion of all ages.\"\r\n\r\nThese citations but faintly indicate the impression made by Mrs.\r\nDelany on her contemporaries. It is not, however, an impression\r\nsustained by any existing work of hers. The seventy-two pictures\r\nshe painted were copies of old masters with occasional portraits\r\nof relatives and friends, and they were highly prized at the time,\r\nbut no one of them was of sufficient excellence to secure permanent\r\nrecognition. Her wide and diversified reading is evidenced by her\r\nletters which are full of references to the histories, novels, plays,\r\ncriticism, and devotional works occupying her eager attention. She\r\ncarried books on every journey. She read or was read to every spare\r\nmoment. But none of this miscellaneous devotion to books resulted in\r\nanything like learning or even in a critically discriminating taste.\r\n\r\nHer two real achievements were letter-writing and hand-work. Over\r\na thousand of her letters have been published. They are lively and\r\nentertaining and are valuable for the study of mid-eighteenth-century\r\nsocial life. Especially vivid are her accounts of festivities. The\r\nrooms and their furnishings, the gowns and jewels of the ladies,\r\nthe refreshments served, the guests and their idiosyncrasies, are\r\neffectively sketched in. There is humorous appreciation, but no touch\r\nof malice, and almost no gossip. The refinement and sweetness of\r\ntone in the letters never becomes vapid or mawkish. There is always\r\na counter-balancing gayety and buoyancy of mood. Mrs. Delany must\r\nhave made letter-writing nearly as much a matter of business as did\r\nMiss Seward, but the heavy \"epistolary solicitudes\" of the Swan of\r\nLichfield are at the other end of the scale from Mrs. Delany's bright\r\nnaturalness. Mrs. Delany's letters are but a clear medium revealing\r\n\"the fine lady, the good woman, and the good Christian\" of Dr.\r\nDelany's picture of \"Maria.\"\r\n\r\nThe most surprising element of Mrs. Delany's life is her hand-work.\r\nIn October, 1750, she wrote: \"I am going to make a very comfortable\r\ncloset, to have a dresser, and all manner of working tools, to keep\r\nall my stores for painting, carving, and gilding, etc., for my own\r\nroom is now so clean and pretty that I cannot suffer it to be strewed\r\nwith litter, only books and work, and the closet belonging to it to\r\nbe given up to prints, drawings, and my collections of fossils and\r\nminerals.\"\r\n\r\nWith almost any tool she had instinctive dexterity, and she had taste\r\nand originality. She apparently enjoyed every kind of hand-work that\r\ncame to her notice. She never wasted a minute. The knotting-shuttle\r\nand the embroidery needle were constant attendants on her tea-table\r\nhours, and she accomplished almost unbelievable amounts in\r\ndesigning and working fancy gowns, coverings for chairs and sofas,\r\nbed-curtains, etc. She made a carpet and other elaborate pieces in\r\ndouble cross-stitch; she did \"shell lustres\" and chenille work; she\r\ndesigned and executed a chapel ceiling in cards and shells. Most\r\nremarkable of all is her herbal begun when she was seventy-two and\r\ncompleted when she was eighty-five. The flowers were made of colored\r\npapers and were so accurate as hardly to be distinguished from\r\nthe flowers themselves. This paper mosaic was left to the Duchess\r\nof Portland with a selection of twenty of the flowers to Queen\r\nCharlotte. The herbal is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nA review of the achievements of Mrs. Delany--her painting, her\r\nhand-work, her letter-writing, her multifarious reading--shows that\r\nthese are but incidental to her personal charm. Her beauty, and the\r\nloveliness of her nature, made a fine commendatory background for\r\nwhatever she did. A friend's portrait, a design for a gown, a bit\r\nof turning in ivory, a letter--every trifle gained in value when\r\nillumined by the \"dove's eyes\" of so high-bred and elegant a lady.\r\nHer character was marked by uprightness, dignity, and good judgment.\r\nShe was delicate in her feelings, gentle, courteous, and most\r\nsincerely kind. All of her qualities made her a desirable member of\r\nany family or social group. It is as a fine lady of the best type\r\nthat she is remembered, not as a learned woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elizabeth Carter (1717-1806)]\r\n\r\nElizabeth Carter lived nearly half a century after the close of\r\nthe period now under consideration, and her fame as a learned lady\r\nbelongs chiefly in the second half of the century, but the work on\r\nwhich that fame was based belongs before 1760. Our knowledge of\r\nher life comes mainly from two sources, her _Memoirs_ published in\r\n1807 by her nephew and executor, Montagu Pennington, and a series\r\nof letters between Miss Carter and Miss Talbot written in the years\r\n1741-1770 and published in 1809. There are also many allusions to\r\nMiss Carter in contemporary writings.[374]\r\n\r\nMiss Carter's linguistic tastes were early in evidence, but she\r\nwas discouragingly slow and dull in mastering language details. It\r\nwas by sheer force of industry that she developed her remarkable\r\naptitude for foreign tongues. Latin, Greek, and Hebrew she learned\r\nfrom her father. Italian, Spanish, and German she taught herself.\r\nFrench she had learned as a child from a Huguenot refugee minister\r\nin Canterbury. She also gained some knowledge of Portuguese, and\r\nshe finally studied Arabic. She began her career as an author at\r\nseventeen with verses signed \"Eliza\" in _The Gentleman's Magazine_.\r\nAt twenty-one her slender little volume of poems appeared. It is all\r\noccasional verse and nowhere rises to any particular excellence.\r\nBut its moralizing and reflective tone proved acceptable to many\r\nreaders and there were new editions in 1762, 1766, 1776, 1777, with a\r\ntranslation into French in 1706.\r\n\r\nIn 1739 Miss Carter's knowledge of French and Italian, her wide\r\nreading, and her interest in philosophical questions were shown by\r\nher translation from the French of an attack on Pope's _Essay on\r\nMan_, by M. Crousaz,[375] and a translation from the Italian of\r\nAlgarotti's _Newtonianismo per le dame_.[376] At thirty-two she began\r\nher translation of _Epictetus_ at the request of Miss Talbot and\r\nArchbishop Secker. She kept rather fitfully at this task for three\r\nyears, from time to time forwarding completed sheets to the deanery.\r\nShe had not made the translation with any thought of publication and\r\nit was with much difficulty that she could be brought to consider the\r\nthought of presenting her work to a general public. But consensus of\r\nauthoritative opinion as to the ethical value of the original and\r\nthe excellence of the translation led her finally to consent to a\r\nsubscription publication at a guinea a volume in 1758. The success\r\nwas unprecedented. Her share of the profits was one thousand guineas\r\nand her fame was established beyond cavil.\r\n\r\nAfter _Epictetus_ we hear of no more work by Miss Carter. Her\r\nintellectual life was not, however, at a standstill. She kept up her\r\nlanguages by daily assigned readings, she read much in ancient and\r\nmodern history, she shows thorough familiarity with new books of\r\nscience, poetry, and letters. She practiced on the spinet and German\r\nflute. She was an admirable housekeeper, being in especial repute for\r\npuddings, cakes, and pastries. All odd minutes were given to work\r\nwith the needle and the shuttle. And she was guide and teacher to her\r\nyoung half-brothers and sisters. But we get no more poems, no more\r\nlearned translations.\r\n\r\nHer growing reputation as the most distinguished _bas bleu_ in\r\nEngland, her social success during London winters, the awe with\r\nwhich her country neighbors regarded her as \"the greatest schollard\r\nin the world,\" her travels in England and on the Continent, her\r\nliterary and artistic friendships--all these given in vivid detail in\r\nher letters--belong in the picture of the brilliant life after the\r\nmid-century mark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISS ELIZABETH CARTER\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving in _The Works of Elizabeth Carter_, 1806]\r\n\r\nBut in whatever period, from whatever point of view, Miss Carter\r\npresents us with a career almost unexampled in the annals\r\nof learned ladies. She chose learning young and pursued it\r\nundeviatingly, with no hesitancies and no retrospective regrets.\r\nThere were no disapproving friends or relatives to interpose\r\nobstacles in her path. Few girls, even to-day, could have greater\r\nfreedom in the determination of their own hours, occupations, and\r\npleasures. Her father, though disheartened by her slow progress,\r\nwas her faithful teacher. Even her stepmother aided and abetted\r\nher extravagant devotion to study. She was allowed to determine\r\nthe momentous question of marriage entirely according to her own\r\ninclinations. Her published work met with immediate praise. She was\r\nbut twenty-two when Johnson published epigrams in Greek and Latin in\r\nher honor, and said she should be praised in as many languages as\r\nLewis the Grand. And by middle life she had achieved independence,\r\nmoney, and fame.\r\n\r\nNor was her career merely an external success brilliantly masking\r\nunsatisfied inner desires. On the contrary, to the end her\r\neighty-nine years seemed rich and gracious to her. She did not covet\r\nother women's lovers or husbands or children or homes. She set\r\npossible honors lightly aside. When her friends were urging upon her\r\na place at court, she dreamed that she had cut off her head for the\r\ngreater convenience of curling her hair, and she declared this dream\r\nsymbolic of the fatal cost at which honors were often bought. Her\r\njoys were of an unambitious, quiet, perennial sort. She loved nature\r\nin all its moods of storm and shine. Her genius for friendship nearly\r\nequaled the \"Matchless Orinda's.\" She loved reading and had many\r\nbooks. She enjoyed reflection and had many hours of happy solitude.\r\nShe was domestic in her tastes and found herself loved and needed in\r\nher father's home. She had a sound, sweet, sensible, modest nature\r\nthat not only disarmed criticism, but preserved her from any undue or\r\narrogant emphasis on her position as the most distinguished literary\r\nwoman of her time. And she had an unfailing sense of humor that sent\r\nan undercurrent of enjoyment through even the prosaic and dreary\r\nparts of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BOARDING-SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS\r\n\r\nOf schools for girls in the period from 1650 to 1750 we can get only\r\nthe most scattered bits of information. It is apparent that there\r\nwere boarding-schools for girls from five to sixteen, and that these\r\nschools rapidly increased in number, but of the scope and nature of\r\nthe instruction we have only the most general ideas. In 1677 there\r\nappeared the following advertisement:\r\n\r\n  In Oxford there is set up a boarding-school for young gentlewomen\r\n  (by John Waver, Master in the art of dancing) where they may be\r\n  educated and instructed in the art of dancing, singing, music,\r\n  writing, and all manner of works.\r\n\r\nA more famous school was at Chelsea in Gorges House. Our first\r\nknowledge of this boarding-school comes from a play given by the\r\npupils. It was dated 1676 and was entitled \"_Beauty's Triumph_,\r\na masque presented by the scholars of Mr. Jeffrey Banister and\r\nMr. James Hart at their new Boarding-School for young Ladies and\r\nGentlewomen kept in that house which was formerly Sir Arthur Gorges\r\nat Chelsey.\"[377] The \"Epilogue--Spoken by a young lady\" recounts\r\n\"the serious things\" done in the school, embroidery and modeling in\r\nwax being the chief items.\r\n\r\n      One in rich works with lively colours tells\r\n      Lucretia's rape or mourning Philomel's;\r\n      Each chaste beholder sighs and drops a tear.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Another's different mind more pleasure takes\r\n      In various forms to mould the painted wax;\r\n      Such shape, such beauty in each piece is shown,\r\n      Nature sits pale, or blushing on her own,\r\n      To see her pride by curious art out-done.\r\n\r\nBetween 1680 and 1690 Purcell's _Dido and Æneas_ was given at this\r\nschool. D'Urfey's _Love for Money; or, the Boarding School_ (1691)\r\nhas its scene \"Chelsey by the River\" and is supposed to refer to this\r\nschool. It was here that Molly Verney learned to japan. The school\r\nmaintained its repute under Mr. Portman, and later under Josias\r\nPriests.\r\n\r\nIn 1680 the school was advertised:\r\n\r\n  Josias Priests, dancing master, that kept a boarding school\r\n  for gentlewomen in Leicester Field is removed to the great\r\n  school-house in Chelsea, which was Mr. Portman's, where he did\r\n  teach, and will continue the said master and others to the\r\n  improvement of the said school.\r\n\r\nGorges House was demolished in 1726.\r\n\r\nTwo other notices belong in the reign of Queen Anne. The first one\r\nshows the continued popularity of the Hackney schools:\r\n\r\n  Whereas it is reported that Mrs. Overing who keeps a Boarding\r\n  School at Bethnal Green near Hackney, is leaving off; this is to\r\n  give Notice that the said Report is false, if not Malicious. And\r\n  that she continues to take sober young Gentlewomen to board and\r\n  teach whatever is necessary to the Accomplishment of that sex.\r\n\r\nThe second one reads,\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Elizabeth Tutchin continues to keep her school at Highgate,\r\n  notwithstanding Reports to the contrary. Where young Gentlewomen\r\n  may be soberly Educated, and taught all sorts of Learning fit for\r\n  young Gentlewomen.[378]\r\n\r\nIn _The Levellers_ a dialogue between two young ladies, we have an\r\naccount of the education given at most of these schools. One of the\r\nyoung ladies says:\r\n\r\n  You know my father was a tradesman, and lived very well by his\r\n  traffick; and I, being beautiful, he thought nature had already\r\n  given me part of my portion, and therefore he would add a liberal\r\n  education, that I might be a complete gentlewoman; away he sent\r\n  me to the boarding school; there I learned to dance and sing; to\r\n  play on the bass viol, virginals, spinet, and guitar. I learned\r\n  to make wax work, japan, paint upon glass, to raise paste,\r\n  make sweetmeats, sauces, and everything that was genteel and\r\n  fashionable.[379]\r\n\r\nOne element here indicated seems to have held a fairly permanent\r\nplace, and that is some trifling form of hand-work. A book published\r\nin 1671 gives a hint as to the nature of this work. It is entitled\r\n_Four hundred new sorts of Birds, Beasts, Flowers, Fruits, Fish,\r\nFlyes, Worms, Landskips, Ovals, and Histories, etc. Lively coloured\r\nfor all sorts of Gentlewomen and School-Mistresses Works._ Many\r\nof the kinds of work with which women attempted to get rid of\r\ntheir leisure were apparently taught in the schools. All sorts of\r\nneedlework seem to have been included in the necessary subjects.\r\nThe interest in samplers is shown by a reference in _The Tatler_,\r\nApril 19, 1709, to an \"excellent discourse\" by \"Mrs. Arabella Manly,\r\nSchool-Mistress at Hackney,\" entitled _An Essay on the Invention of\r\nSamplers, communicated by Mrs. Judith Bagford with an account of her\r\nCollections for the same_.[380]\r\n\r\nIn 1714 a \"Venerable Correspondent\" wrote to _The Spectator_ that in\r\nher day young women \"Worked Beds, Chairs, and Hangings,\" and urged\r\n_The Spectator_ to recommend a renewal of these activities. The\r\nhumorous response is hardly an exaggerated statement of the great\r\npieces of work undertaken by the women of the seventeenth century:\r\n\r\n  What a delightful Entertainment must it be to the Fair Sex, whom\r\n  their native Modesty, and the Tenderness of Men towards them,\r\n  exempts from Publick Business, to pass their hours in imitating\r\n  Fruits and Flowers, and transplanting all the Beauties of Nature\r\n  into their own Dress, or raising a new Creation in their Closets\r\n  and Apartments. How pleasing is the Amusement of walking among\r\n  the Shades and Groves planted by themselves, in surveying Heroes\r\n  slain by their Needle, or little Cupids which they have brought\r\n  into the World without Pain.\r\n\r\n  This is, methinks, the most proper way wherein a Lady can shew a\r\n  fine Genius, and I cannot forbear wishing, that several Writers\r\n  of that Sex had chosen to apply themselves rather to Tapestry\r\n  than Rhime. Your Pastoral Poetesses may vent their Fancy in Rural\r\n  Landskips, and place despairing Shepherds under silken Willows,\r\n  or drown them in a Stream of Mohair.... How memorable would that\r\n  Matron be, who should have it Inscribed upon her Monument, \"That\r\n  she wrought out the whole Bible in Tapestry, and died in a good\r\n  old Age, after having covered three hundred Yards of Wall in the\r\n  Mansion-House.\"[381]\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century embroidery and tapestry are still an\r\noccupation, but other and less tedious works partially supplant them.\r\nPope's Grotto was not an isolated curiosity. _The Spectator_ suggests\r\nthe part women were taking in the manufacture of grottoes:\r\n\r\n  There is a very particular kind of Work, which of late several\r\n  Ladies here in our Kingdom seem very fond of, which seems very\r\n  well adapted to a Poetical Genius: It is the making of Grottos.\r\n  I know a Lady who has a very Beautiful one, composed by herself,\r\n  nor is there one Shell in it not stuck up by her own Hands.[382]\r\n\r\nPope wrote an inscription for a \"Grotto of Shells at Crux Easton, the\r\nWork of Nine young Ladies.\" These young ladies were sisters and their\r\ngrotto was also celebrated by \"N. H.\"[383] In 1735 \"S. J.\" wrote\r\na poem to a Lady to accompany a present of shells and stones for\r\nher grotto.[384] In 1746 Mr. Graves congratulated Lady Fane on her\r\n\"grotto divine\" where \"miracles are wrought by shells.\"[385]\r\n\r\nPaper-cutting also remained something of an art. Waller had praised\r\na lady who skillfully cut a tree in paper.[386] Cutting silhouettes\r\nwas one of the diversions of the circle of Dr. Swift, Dr. Delany,\r\nand Mr. Sheridan. There is a series of poems, concerning \"Dan\r\nJackson's Picture Cut in Silk and Paper,\" by Lady Betty.[387] The\r\nmost important cut-paper work on record is Mrs. Delany's herbarium\r\nor paper mosaics, but this did not come till the last quarter of the\r\ncentury.[388]\r\n\r\nMrs. Barber's _Patch-Work Screen_ gets its name from another sort of\r\ndevice. Screens were adorned by pasting odds and ends of pictures all\r\nover them. Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe wrote to the Duchess of Somerset in\r\n1734: \"The screen your Ladyship sent me is a Rareeshew for all the\r\nwomen and children about town who have anything of a nice and elegant\r\ntaste.\" The Duchess was at this time doing tent-stitch concerning\r\nwhich Mrs. Rowe wrote:\r\n\r\n  I am delighted with all your entertainments, except the\r\n  _Tent-stitch_; and that I own, I admire, but then 't is as some\r\n  people admire virtue, only in speculation. It seems to me an\r\n  ante-diluvian invention, a task for those long-breath'd people,\r\n  who spent a sort of eternity on earth, compar'd to the short\r\n  duration of a modern period. However, I am in no pain for your\r\n  Ladyship: whether your attempt is a chair or a stool, I suppose\r\n  it will be an hereditary occupation; if you finish the branch of\r\n  a tree, and Lady ----, a shepherd's crook, the service of your\r\n  generation is done, and you may contentedly leave the rest to be\r\n  finished by your children's children.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 Lady Bute had just completed a carpet concerning which she\r\nwrote to her mother, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Lady Mary answered:\r\n\r\n  You need not excuse to me taking notice of your carpet. I think\r\n  you have great reason to value your-self on the performance, but\r\n  will have better than I have had if you can persuade anybody\r\n  else to do so. I could never get people to believe that I set a\r\n  stitch, when I worked six hours in a day.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most popular of all the arts was japanning. Molly (b.\r\n1675), the daughter of Edmund Verney, was sent at eight to Mrs.\r\nPriest's school at Great Chelsey. Her father wrote to her:\r\n\r\n  I find you have a desire to learn to Jappan, as you call it,\r\n  and I approve of it; and so I shall of anything that is Good &\r\n  Virtuous, therefore learn in God's name all Good Things, & I\r\n  will willingly be at the Charge so farr as I am able--tho' they\r\n  come from Japan or from never so farr & Looke of an Indian Hue\r\n  & Odour, for I admire all accomplishments that will render you\r\n  considerable, and Lovely in the sight of God and man.[389]\r\n\r\nThe continued favor accorded japanning is shown by a letter from Mrs.\r\nRowe to the Duchess of Somerset in 1734:\r\n\r\n  My great attainment at present is colouring prints: If Lady ----\r\n  wants any birds for her new _Japan_, I have some at her service.\r\n  Mrs. ---- is so inchanted with this new japanning, that she has\r\n  abandon'd Mr. _Baxter_, and the _Greek_ Fathers, and employes her\r\n  time in sticking bears and monkies on all the wooden furniture\r\n  she can find about the house.\r\n\r\nJapanning was taught in most of the schools.\r\n\r\nMrs. Montagu, Queen of the Blue-Stockings, was indefatigable in her\r\ndevotion to hand-work. Not only was she familiar with every kind of\r\nneedlework, but she turned in wood and ivory, made shell grottoes,\r\nand designed shell frames, and she planned and executed feather\r\nhangings for a room. Mrs. Delany is the only lady whose recorded work\r\nexceeds that of Mrs. Montagu in amount and variety.\r\n\r\nDomestic science was faintly foreshadowed in what were known as\r\n\"Pastry Schools.\" The following illustrates the type:\r\n\r\n  To all young ladies at Edw. Kidder's Pastry School in little\r\n  Lincoln's Inn Fields are taught all sorts of Pastry and Cookery,\r\n  Dutch hollow works, and Butter works, on Thursdays, Fridays,\r\n  and Saturday, in the afternoon, and on the same days in the\r\n  Morning, at his school in Norris Street in St. James's Market,\r\n  and at his School in St. Martin's Le Grand, on Monday, Tuesday,\r\n  and Wednesday in the Afternoons. And at his School at St. Mary\r\n  Overies Dock, Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesday Mornings from 9 to\r\n  12.[390]\r\n\r\nAn entertaining passage in Shadwell's _The Scowrers_ (1690) indicates\r\nsomething of the character of a girl's education in the country:\r\n\r\n  _Priscilla._ Did she not bestow good breeding upon you there?\r\n\r\n  _Eugenia._ Breeding! what, to learn to feed Ducklings, and cram\r\n  Chickens?\r\n\r\n  _Clara._ To see cows milk'd, learn to Churn, and make cheese?\r\n\r\n  _Eugen._ To make Clouted cream, and whipt sillabubs?\r\n\r\n  _Clara._ To make a Caraway Cake, and raise Py Crust?\r\n\r\n  _Eugen._ And to learn the top of your skill in Syrrup, Sweetmeat,\r\n  _Aqua Mirabilis_, and Snayl water.\r\n\r\n  _Clara._ Or your great Cunning in Cheese cake, several Creams and\r\n  Almond butter.\r\n\r\n  _Prisc._ Ay, ay, and 't were better for all the Gentlemen in\r\n  England that Wives had no other breeding, but you had Musick and\r\n  Dancing.\r\n\r\n  _Eugen._ Yes, an ignorant, illiterate, hopping Puppy, that rides\r\n  his Dancing Circuit thirty Miles about, lights off his tyred\r\n  steed, draws his Kit at a poor Country creature, and gives her a\r\n  Hich in her Pace, that she shall never recover.\r\n\r\n  _Clara._ And for Musick an old hoarse singing man riding ten\r\n  miles from his Cathedral to Quaver out the Glories of our Birth\r\n  and State, or it may be a Scotch Song more hideous and barbarous\r\n  than an Irish Cronan.\r\n\r\n  _Eugen._ And another Musick Master from the next town to Teach\r\n  one to twinkle out _Lilly burlero_ upon an old pair of Virginals,\r\n  that sound worse than a Tinker's Kettle that cries for his work\r\n  on.\r\n\r\nWe happen to have somewhat more definite knowledge of one early\r\neighteenth-century school for girls. Mrs. Hannah Wood, the \"Mistress\r\nof a College-Boarding School\" in Bury, in 1723, was the sister of Mr.\r\nD. Bellamy who wrote \"Dramatic Entertainments\" for the \"Annual Public\r\nExercises of the School.\" These \"Entertainments\" were published with\r\na dedication to Mrs. Wood, \"A Prefatory Essay,\" and some \"Familiar\r\nLetters.\" Mr. Bellamy considers it the particular province of Mrs.\r\nWood \"to polish Nature,\" since she has \"a perfect Idea of every\r\nFemale Accomplishment\" and if her young ladies can be \"One Virtue the\r\nbetter\" through his labors it is ample reward.\r\n\r\nMr. Bellamy's plays were rather elaborately staged. There were\r\n\"pastoral figure dances\" and considerable singing. One character\r\nenters \"drest like a Gentleman.\" There is a machine for the descent\r\nof Apollo. The dramas performed are carefully adapted to young\r\nladies, \"the porcelaine-clay of humankind.\" Mr. Bellamy examines\r\nevery word and weighs each thought to see that \"The sence is Chast\r\nand inoffensive to nicest tast.\" The first of the plays given is\r\n_Vanquish'd Love: or, The Jealous Queen_, an adaptation of the\r\n_Rosamund_ of Addison. The emphasis on warm passions, amorous\r\nprayers, guilty fires, rage, jealousy, vengeance, and death, would\r\nbut doubtfully contribute to the delicate innocence of the young\r\nladies. All is, however, made right by the abrupt and unnatural\r\nrepentance of King Henry, and his eulogy of the sweets of \"Virtuous\r\nLove.\" The second play, _Innocence Betray'd; or, The Royal Imposter_,\r\nwas taken from Cowley's _Love's Riddle_. In the Epilogue a young lady\r\nsays the auditors may\r\n\r\n      Wish we had Rehears'd our Spelling Books:\r\n      And think our Time had been much better spent\r\n      In Cross-Stitch, Irish-Stitch, or at the Tent.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Bellamy is quite conscious that some indulgent and timorous\r\nparents may censure his designs of teaching young ladies to speak\r\nbefore an audience:\r\n\r\n  There are too many, I know, are of Opinion, that the _Art of\r\n  Pronunciation_ is no Female Accomplishment; that the Ladies were\r\n  design'd by Nature for the Objects of Sight only; and that to\r\n  encourage them in Dramatic Representations, is to offer Violence\r\n  to their native Modesty....\r\n\r\n  'T was an Observation of One of the most learned Prelates of his\r\n  Age, the late Archbishop of Cambray, That the general Mistake of\r\n  Parents in the Education of their Daughters, was this: \"That they\r\n  were too solicitous about the Ornament of their Person, and too\r\n  remiss, if not entirely regardless, of the Endowments of their\r\n  Mind.\"\r\n\r\n  'T is pity methinks that the favourite Works of Nature should be\r\n  nothing but moving Pictures, and, like Sir _Godfrey Kneller's_\r\n  Canvas, as Mr. Dryden expresses it, only _Look a Voice_; that the\r\n  Study of the Toilet should be recommended to them, as their most\r\n  material Accomplishment, whilst the Improvement of their Judgment\r\n  is neglected as a Trifle, and the early Exercise of their\r\n  Rational Faculties esteem'd, if not a Crime, an Act of Imprudence\r\n  and ill Conduct.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation of the play the young ladies are urged to enter\r\ninto the characters they have taken, and to remember the reverence\r\nand respect they owe their auditors. Under more specific directions\r\nMr. Bellamy says:\r\n\r\n  In the first place, Ladies, carefully avoid all unnatural\r\n  Distortions both of your Limbs and Features. Wry mouths,\r\n  contracted Brows, shrug'd up shoulders, and the like are Farce\r\n  and Buffoonry, very disagreeable and very ungenteel: Nay,\r\n  Coughing and Spitting, unless very accidental, are vicious\r\n  Habits, and ought betimes to be corrected.\r\n\r\nAmong \"Useful Observations\" is the following on modulation of the\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n  All Persons Names, viz., I, Thou, He, She, We, Ye, and They, etc.\r\n  and their following States, Me, Thee, Him, Her, Us, You, and\r\n  Them, etc. and their Possessives, My, Thy, Our, Yours, Theirs,\r\n  Mine, Thine, etc. and all Epithets, Adjectives, or Qualities,\r\n  by which Substantives, Beings, or Things are explain'd and\r\n  distinguish'd as, Black, White, Good, Bad, Round, Square, and the\r\n  like, should always be read or spoken with a clear, open, and\r\n  distinct Voice, as they are for the most part very emphatical,\r\n  and the Beauty of Expression depends much upon them.\r\n\r\nIn a letter on \"Female Accomplishments\" the Virtuous and Fair Antiope\r\nin the twenty-second book of Fénelon's _Telemachus_ is set forth as\r\nan example of a lady of the first quality. Her silence, modesty,\r\nreservedness, gentleness, her assiduous industry in spinning and\r\nembroidering, her regularity and order and poise, make her a treasure\r\nworthy to be sought in far regions. In the letter on \"Innocent\r\nRecreations\" reading is particularly commended. The \"chaste and very\r\nuseful\" collection of books suggested is based on the Postscript to\r\nDr. Hickes's _Instructions for the Education of a Daughter_, and is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  The whole Duty of Man, The Lady's Calling, The Government of the\r\n  Tongue, Mr. Nelson's Companion for the Feast and Fasts of the\r\n  Church of England, Meditations and Soliloquies of St. Augustine,\r\n  Comber and Bennet on the Liturgy, Mr. Boyle on the Style of the\r\n  Scriptures. Tillotson's Sermons, Paradise Lost with Addison's\r\n  judicious and entertaining Remarks, Blackmore's Paraphrase on\r\n  Job, Cowley's Davideis.\r\n\r\nFor the gayer part of poetry,\r\n\r\n  Mr. Waller, Mr. Cowley's _Mistress_, some pieces of Mr. Prior,\r\n  particularly his _Henry_ and _Emma_. Mr. Norris's _Miscellany_,\r\n  and Mr. Watts's _Horæ Lyricæ_. For precepts of Morality I would\r\n  lay before her Sir Roger L'Estrange's _Seneca_ and his _Fables_;\r\n  Mr. Collier's _Essays_ and his _Antoninus_ and some select pieces\r\n  of the Letters and Spectators.\r\n\r\nFor history, Lord Clarendon on the _Rebellion_ and Dr. Welwood's\r\n_Memoirs_ are suggested.\r\n\r\n  For novels, the _Adventures of Telemachus_, translated by Mr.\r\n  Ozell; and _Don Quixot_ by Mr. Motteux, Mr. Congreve, and others,\r\n  are the only Pieces that I would offer to her. For Plays, tho'\r\n  there are too many unfit for a young Lady's Perusal: yet such as\r\n  _Cato_, _Love and Empire_, _Tamerlane_, the _Mourning Bride_, the\r\n  _Distress'd Mother_, _Phædra and Hippolitus_, and the _Conscious\r\n  Lovers_, with many more, can never be read without Pleasure and\r\n  Improvement.\r\n\r\nSchools for young ladies increased in number during the eighteenth\r\ncentury, especially near London. Malcolm, in 1808, said that even so\r\nearly as 1759\r\n\r\n  two or three houses might be seen in almost every village, with\r\n  the inscription, \"Young Ladies boarded and educated,\" where every\r\n  description of tradesmen sent their children to be instructed,\r\n  not in the useful attainments necessary for humble life, but\r\n  the arts of coquetry and self-consequence--in short, those of\r\n  a _young lady_. The person who received the children had then\r\n  the sounding title of Governess: and French and Dancing-masters\r\n  prepared the girl for the hour when contempt for her parents'\r\n  deficiencies was to be substituted for affection and respect.\r\n  Instead of reading their native language with propriety and just\r\n  emphasis, it was totally neglected, and in place of nervous\r\n  sentences and flowing periods, the vulgarisms of low life were\r\n  continued; while the lady repeated familiar words of the French\r\n  language with a sound peculiar to Boarding-schools, and quite\r\n  unintelligible to a native of France: the pleasing labours of the\r\n  needle were thrown aside, and the young lady soon became an adept\r\n  in imitating laces and spoiling the beauty of coloured silks.[391]\r\n\r\nThe _Idler_ in 1750 comments on female education as spoiling girls\r\nfor service:\r\n\r\n  Scarcely a wench was to be got for all work, since education had\r\n  made such numbers of fine ladies that nobody would now accept a\r\n  lower title than that of waiting-maid, or something that might\r\n  qualify her to wear laced shoes and long ruffles and to sit at\r\n  work in the parlor window.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CHARITY SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nIn 1698 the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge started a\r\nmovement for the establishment of charity schools. An organized\r\npropaganda for getting subscriptions was undertaken by the bishops\r\nand was so successful that between 1698 and 1715 more than one\r\nhundred of these schools were established in London and Westminster.\r\nIn this scheme poor girls were considered as well as poor boys.\r\nThey were, of course, in separate schools.[392] Each school had\r\na prescribed uniform and the pupils marching in a body made a\r\npicturesque addition to many a civic festival. In 1714 Thoresby went\r\nto hear \"the Bishop of London preach the charity sermon before an\r\nalmost innumerable company of poor children, decently clad in various\r\ncolours, which are Christianly educated and cared for in the several\r\nwards of the city, both for soul and body.\"[393] In 1723 he again\r\nrecords seeing the Lord Mayor in all his pomp going to St. Bride's\r\nChurch with a great train of charity children, all decently habited,\r\nsome with blue coats with yellow vests, others brown, most with\r\nblue caps, but some with white hats and mathematical instruments in\r\ntheir hands.[394] By 1753 the number of charity children that went\r\nto Christ Church to hear the Anniversary Sermon was five thousand.\r\nWilliam Blake, in _Songs of Innocence_ (1789) and in _Songs of\r\nExperience_ (1799), gives the impression of great numbers. In the\r\nfirst of these commemorations Blake voices what was the general\r\nattitude, and that is a eulogy of London's magnificent generosity.\r\nThe second one represents a much more modern tone, that of question\r\nas to a city's social and civic standards where the supply of\r\nhelpless orphans was so large and so constant.\r\n\r\nThe word education is too pretentious for most of these schools.\r\nThe purpose in the main was to train boys and girls for service. In\r\nthe pictures drawn by Hogarth in 1741 in honor of Captain Coram's\r\nnoble charity, _The Foundling Hospital_, the three little girls in\r\nthe foreground are holding a spinning-wheel, a sampler, and a broom,\r\nindicating branches of industry to which they were destined.\r\n\r\nThere were also many privately endowed schools in various parts of\r\nEngland. In 1726 William Law, the author of _The Serious Call_,\r\nbrought out a treatise on _Christian Perfection_. It is said that an\r\nanonymous stranger presented him with £1000 on reading it. The next\r\nyear Law founded a school for fourteen girls at King's Cliffe, and\r\nthe money is supposed to have come from this gift. When Archibald\r\nHutcheson died in 1740 he expressed a wish that his widow should lead\r\na retired and religious life under Law's guidance. Miss Hester Gibbon\r\njoined Mrs. Hutcheson. Their joint income was £2600 a year, most of\r\nwhich they planned to spend in charity. In 1744 they settled down in\r\nKing's Cliffe in Law's house, formerly a royal manor house and known\r\nas \"King John's Palace,\" where they continued the girls' school,\r\nand added to it a school for eighteen boys. The important schools\r\nin Yorkshire founded by Lady Elizabeth Hastings have already been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nOther more private and personal and less permanent educational\r\nventures are occasionally recorded. A religious family school\r\nsomething after the fashion of Little Gidding was now and then\r\nattempted. One \"religious retirement\" is mentioned by Bishop Ken. Two\r\ndear friends whom he frequently visited were Mary and Anne Kemys of\r\nCefn Mably, Glamorganshire. After the death of their mother in 1683\r\nthey went to reside at Naish Court, about a mile from Porteshead.\r\nThere they established a kind of Anglican sisterhood where they\r\nlived a devout life and did charitable works. Bishop Ken was their\r\nspiritual adviser, and since he had known Nicholas Ferrar well, it\r\nis not unlikely that the ideals at Naish Court were somewhat like\r\nthose at Little Gidding.[395] In 1698 Sir George Wheler brought out a\r\ntractate entitled _A Protestant Monastery, or Christian Œconomics_,\r\ncontaining _Directions for the Religious Conduct of a Family_. He\r\nfounded and endowed a school for girls at Houghton-le-Springs,\r\nDurham, when he was rector there. Sir George Wheler was an intimate\r\nfriend and a disciple of Dr. Hickes with whom he went abroad. It\r\nwas evidently through the influence of Dr. Hickes that he became an\r\nadvocate of higher education for women.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the century Mrs. Montagu went to Bath-Easton to\r\nvisit her sister, Mrs. Scott, and Lady Bab Montagu, who had chosen a\r\nlife of retirement and good works. On her return to Sandleford, Mrs.\r\nMontagu wrote as follows to Mr. Gilbert West:\r\n\r\n  My sister rises early, and as soon as she has read prayers to\r\n  their small family, she sits down to cut out and prepare work\r\n  for 12 poor girls, whose schooling they pay for; to those whom\r\n  she finds more than ordinarily capable, she teaches writing and\r\n  arithmetic herself. The work these children are usually employed\r\n  in is making child-bed linen and clothes for poor people in the\r\n  neighborhood, which Lady Bab Montagu and she bestow as they see\r\n  occasion. Very early on Sunday morning these girls, with 12\r\n  little boys whom they also send to school, come to my sisters and\r\n  repeat their catechism, read some chapters, have the principal\r\n  articles of their religion explained to them, and then are sent\r\n  to the parish church. These good works are often performed by the\r\n  Methodist ladies in the best of enthusiasm, but thank God, my\r\n  sister's is a calm and rational piety. Her conversation is lively\r\n  and easy, and she enters into all the reasonable pleasures of\r\n  Society; goes frequently to the plays, and sometimes to balls,\r\n  etc. They have a very pretty house at Bath for the winter, and\r\n  one at Bath Easton for the summer; their houses are adorned\r\n  by the ingenuity of the owners, but as their income is small,\r\n  they deny themselves unnecessary expences. My sister seems very\r\n  happy; it has pleased God to lead her to truth, by the road of\r\n  affliction; but what draws the sting of death and triumphs over\r\n  the grave, cannot fail to heal the wounds of disappointment. Lady\r\n  Bab Montagu concurs with her in all these things, and their\r\n  convent, for by its regularity it resembles one, is really a\r\n  cheerful place.[396]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. HIGHER EDUCATION\r\n\r\nThe lesser boarding-schools and the charity schools give no\r\nintimation of anything even approximating the higher education of\r\nwomen. But that topic was not neglected. And it is of interest to\r\ntake up in chronological sequence the various expressions of opinion\r\nas to the kind of education women should have.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anna van Schurman (1607-1678)]\r\n\r\nThe first influential writer advocating a large and liberal\r\ncurriculum for women was a foreigner,[397] the famous Anna van\r\nSchurman of Utrecht. She was, indeed, the most famous learned woman\r\nof the seventeenth century, not only in Holland, but in the entire\r\nworld of letters. As a child she gave such indication of unusual\r\npower that her father's interest and ambition were aroused, and\r\nhe gave her perfect freedom and sympathetic coöperation in the\r\ndevelopment of her tastes. There was no regular plan or discipline in\r\nher education. She merely followed out, in art, in handicrafts, in\r\nletters, every new interest of her singularly alert and responsive\r\nmind. Till she was twenty-eight, art in some form was her chief\r\noccupation. She carved portraits in boxwood, modeled them in wax,\r\netched them on glass or copper, and cut medallions in ivory. She\r\ndid fine needlework and intricate embroidery, and worked tapestry.\r\nSpecimens of her scissors-work are still preserved in the Schurman\r\nmuseum at Franeker and show a dexterity that must have been\r\nremarkable even in that day of exquisite cut-paper.[398] And she\r\nexcelled in the fashionable accomplishment of writing in foreign\r\nalphabets. She sang delightfully, and played on the cymbal, the\r\nlute, and the violin. Her interest in the technical side of music\r\nis evidenced by her correspondence with noted musicians such as\r\nHuyghens, Hooft, and Bannius.\r\n\r\nBut gradually during the amateurish delights of these occupations\r\nand through the frivolities of a gay life there had been growing\r\nin Anna's mind a desire for serious work. And from twenty-eight to\r\nforty-eight she gave herself to the learned pursuits on which her\r\ncontemporary renown was based. She became known throughout Europe\r\nand the most extravagant recognition was accorded her. As the finest\r\nLatinist in Utrecht she was chosen to write the ode on the founding\r\nof the University in that city. She was named the \"Star of Utrecht.\"\r\nGisbert Voët, the Rector of the University, taught her Hebrew,\r\nSyriac, and Chaldee, and influenced her to devote years to a textual\r\nstudy of the Bible. Beverwyck, who through admiration for her had\r\nbecome a convinced feminist, dedicated his treatise _De Excellentia\r\nFæmini Sexus_ to her as \"the most wonderful woman of her day.\" Cats\r\nwrote poems to her as the _Wonderstuk_ of the age. Her _Ethiopian\r\nGrammar_ was greeted as a marvel by the scholars of the Dutch\r\nuniversities. Jean Louis Balzac congratulated himself on coming to\r\nknow \"_cette merveilleuse fille_.\" Descartes was one of her close\r\nfriends. She corresponded on terms of equality with theologians like\r\nJacob Lydius and Fredereck Spanheim and M. de Saumaise of Leyden\r\nUniversity. Caspar van Baerle eulogized her as \"a second Sempronia,\r\na better Sappho, a new Pallas.\" She became almost an object of\r\npilgrimage, royal personages being among those attracted by her great\r\nfame. The Queen of Poland, the Duchesse de Longueville, and Christina\r\nof Sweden with an escort of Jesuit priests were among those who made\r\nvisits of state to \"the incomparable Virgin.\"\r\n\r\nThe last twenty years of Anna van Schurman's life were given\r\nentirely to mystical religion under the guidance of Jean de Labadie\r\nof whose community she became the most influential member. But in\r\nthe preceding period many topics of contemporary interest held her\r\nattention. Chief among these was the right of women to free mental\r\ndevelopment. Dr. Rivet, Professor of Theology at Leyden, and her\r\nintimate friend, once wrote to her that ordinary women were debarred\r\nfrom equality with men by \"the sacred laws of Nature.\" Anna responded\r\nin lively protest and said that he based his arguments on custom\r\nand not on reason. In time she wrote a book embodying her own views\r\non the subject. It was published by Elzevir at Leyden in 1641 under\r\nthe title _De ingenii muliebris ad doctrinam et meliores litteras\r\naptitudine_. In 1659 the book was translated into rather stiff and\r\ncumbersome English, by \"C. B.,\" doubtless Clement Barksdale, an\r\nOxford man, a prolific translator from the Latin and much interested\r\nin education. He was master of a free school at Hereford, and later\r\nhad a successful private school at Hawling in Cotswolds. He must\r\nhave had especial interest in the education of women, for in 1675 he\r\nwrote a _Letter touching a College of Maids or a Virgin Society_. Mr.\r\nBarksdale's translation appeared under the title, _The Learned Maid_;\r\nor, _Whether a Maid may be a Scholar. Logick Exercise Written in\r\nLatine by that incomparable Virgin Anna Maria à Schurman of Utrecht.\r\nWith some Epistles to the famous Gassendus and others._ The book\r\nopens with a quotation from Fr. Spanhemius in which he eulogizes\r\nAnna van Schurman as \"the utmost Essay of Nature in this Sex.\" The\r\ntranslation is dedicated to the \"Lady A. H.,\" probably the Lady Anne\r\nHudson to whom Gerbier dedicated his _Elogium Heroinum_. There had\r\nevidently been an earlier translation than Barksdale's, for he says,\r\n\"This _strange maid_, being now the second time drest up in her\r\n_English Habit_, cometh to kiss your hand.\" Two translations into\r\nEnglish within eighteen years indicate a considerable interest in\r\nthe arguments advanced. Yet the form of the book was difficult and\r\nunattractive as is indicated by the phrase \"Logick Exercise.\" Every\r\nargument is thrown into stiff syllogistic form. The portion of the\r\nbook entitled \"A Refutation to the Adversaries\" is somewhat more\r\nnatural and lively. Stripped of their pedantry the arguments against\r\nthe education of women and the answers to these arguments are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Objection: The wits of women are too weak for the study of\r\n  letters.\r\n\r\n  Answer: Not all men have \"heroical wits\" yet they are not\r\n  excluded from studies. No claim is made that all women should\r\n  study, but only those of \"at least indifferent good wits.\"\r\n  Weakness of wit may be aided by study.\r\n\r\n  Objection: Women have no opportunity to prosecute studies, no\r\n  academies or schools being open to them.\r\n\r\n  Answer: There are parents and tutors.\r\n\r\n  Objection: Knowledge is a useless acquirement since women are\r\n  shut out from \"Politicall, Eclesiasticall, or Academicall\"\r\n  offices.\r\n\r\n  Answer: Though they gain not the Primary end of public usefulness\r\n  they yet gain an important secondary personal end.\r\n\r\n  Objection: Since a little knowledge will suffice for a woman in\r\n  her vocation an \"Encyclopædy\" of knowledge is superfluous.\r\n\r\n  Answer: There is ambiguity in the word \"vocation.\" Does it mean\r\n  that woman belongs to private as against public life? Then many\r\n  gentlemen in private life should be shut out from studies. Does\r\n  it mean woman's special calling to Family Life? But all human\r\n  beings have a right to a personal development, a \"Universal\r\n  Calling\" separate from and above their special vocation.\r\n\r\n  Objection: Women do not care for studies, and nothing should \"be\r\n  done _invitâ Minervâ_, as we say, Against the Hair.\"\r\n\r\n  Answer: The assumption that women do not care to apply themselves\r\n  to studies becomes logically important only when it is proved\r\n  of women after excitation and opportunity in studies. \"No man\r\n  can rightly judge of our Inclination to studies, before he hath\r\n  encouraged us by the best reasons and means to set upon them:\r\n  and withall hath given us some _taste_ of their sweetness.\"\r\n\r\nThe arguments given and the objections answered lead to the statement:\r\n\r\n  Wherefore our _Thesis_ stands firm: _A Christian Maid_, or _Woman\r\n  may conveniently give herself to Learning_: Whence we draw this\r\n  Consectary, that Maids may and ought to be excited and encouraged\r\n  by the best and strongest _Reasons_, by the _Testimonies_ of wise\r\n  men: and lastly by the _examples of illustrious Women_, to the\r\n  embracing of this kind of life, especially _those_ who are above\r\n  others provided of _leisure_, and other _means_ and _aides_ for\r\n  their _studies_. And, because it is best, that the mind being\r\n  seasoned with _Learning_ from the very Infancy: therefore the\r\n  _Parents_ themselves are chiefly to be stirred up, as we suppose,\r\n  and to be admonished of their duty.\r\n\r\nIn a presentation of the appropriate range of the studies of women\r\nAnna includes the entire circle of Liberal Arts and Sciences as\r\nconvenient for the Head of a Christian Maid.\r\n\r\n  But specially let regard be had unto those Arts which have\r\n  neerest alliance to _Theology_ and the _Moral Virtues_, and\r\n  are Principally subservient to them. In which number we\r\n  reckon _Grammar_, _Logick_, _Rhetoric_: especially _Logick_,\r\n  fitly called _The Key of all Sciences_: and then, _Physicks_,\r\n  _Metaphysicks_, _History_, etc. and also the knowledge of\r\n  Languages, chiefly of the _Hebrew_ and _Greek_. All which may\r\n  advance to the more facile and full understanding of _Holy\r\n  Scriptures_: to say nothing now of other Books. The rest, i.e.\r\n  _Mathematicks_, (to which is also referred _Musick_) _Poesie_,\r\n  _Picture_, and the like, not illiberal Arts, may obtain the\r\n  place of pretty Ornaments and ingenious Recreations. Lastly,\r\n  those studies which pertain to the practice of the Law, Military\r\n  Discipline, Oratory in the Church, Court, University, as less\r\n  proper and less necessary, we do not very much urge. And yet we\r\n  in no wise yield that our _Maid_ should be excluded from the\r\n  Scholastick Knowledge or Theory of those; especially not from\r\n  understanding the most noble Doctrine of the _Politicks_ or Civil\r\n  Government.\r\n\r\nThe whole book is a eulogy of learning as a specific for all the\r\nills of mind or heart. Anna quotes from the great Erasmus to the\r\neffect that \"nothing takes so full possession of the fair Temple of\r\na Virgin's breast, as learning and study, whither, on all occasions\r\nshe may fly for refuge,\" and hence nothing can so effectually\r\noppose vanity and light-mindedness. Studies will make a woman\r\nsufficient unto herself in leisure hours. Studies perfect and adorn\r\nthe intellect; they conduce to reverence for the most beautiful, the\r\nmost excellent, and so to love of God; they fortify the mind against\r\nheresies, they teach prudence, they destroy fear, they put courage\r\ninto the heart; they give a delight that is like \"Divine gladness\";\r\nand they mollify and sweeten manners. In fine, the liberal pursuit\r\nof learning brings the whole nature into conformity with \"the Rule\r\nof right reason.\" Who, then, would shut women out from delights so\r\nlaudable, virtues so desirable?\r\n\r\nThe whole book gives such an impression of high-minded earnestness,\r\nit is so strenuous and sincere, affirmative arguments are so\r\nelaborately established, and adversaries are so elaborately crushed,\r\nthat it becomes a distinct anti-climax to realize what, after all,\r\nwas the extent of her demand. She virtually asks nothing more than\r\nthat rich girls of good minds shall be allowed and even encouraged to\r\nstudy at home under tutors, with the proviso that they make no public\r\nuse of their learning, that they remember St. Paul's injunction to\r\nwomen \"to be οἰκουργός, keepers at home,\" and that they make learning\r\nthe handmaid of piety. Anna van Schurman was asking for what she\r\nherself had had. And her conception seems somewhat less modest when\r\nwe realize that no scholastic dignities, no authorship, no public\r\noffices, could put a woman of to-day so distinctly in the lime-light\r\nof royal and learned favor as was this retiring Anna in her quiet\r\nlittle home at Utrecht.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bathsua Pell, Mrs. Makin (fl. 1641-1673)]\r\n\r\nThe immediate follower of Anna van Schurman was Bathsua Pell,\r\nbetter known as Mrs. Makin.[399] She is one of the most\r\nsignificant personages connected with the education of girls in\r\nthe mid-seventeenth century. Her father was a rector in Southwick,\r\nSussex. He died in 1616 and his wife in 1617, leaving three\r\nchildren. Thomas became gentleman of the bedchamber to Charles I,\r\nbut went to America in 1635. The younger brother, John (1611-1685),\r\nwas early noted as a student. At thirteen he entered Trinity at\r\nCambridge, being even then \"as good a scholar as some masters of\r\narts.\" At twenty he was reported to know Hebrew, Greek, Latin,\r\nArabic, Italian, French, High and Low Dutch. By the time he was\r\ntwenty-three he had specialized in mathematics. He held important\r\nmathematical posts under Cromwell; and, later, under Charles II, he\r\nwas given a valuable living. Bathsua Pell had her brother's talent\r\nfor languages, and like him had an early repute for learning. About\r\n1641, when she was perhaps about thirty, she was appointed tutoress\r\nto Princess Elizabeth, the six-year-old daughter of Charles I. The\r\nlearned tutoress was apparently at liberty to follow her own ideas\r\nof education, and for several years she led the sad little Princess\r\ninto such delights as might be found in the languages and theology.\r\nShe boasted of her pupil's proficiency, saying that at nine she\r\ncould \"write, read, and in some measure understand, Latin, Greek,\r\nHebrew, French and Italian.\"[400] Mrs. Makin had other distinguished\r\npupils. Among them was Lucy Davies, daughter to Sir John Davies,\r\nAttorney-General for Ireland, and better known as author of _Nosce\r\nTeipsum_, and Eleanor Truchett, fluent author of half-mad books of\r\nprophecy.[401] Lucy married the sixth Earl of Huntington. After his\r\ndeath in 1655, when their son was but six years old, as Countess\r\nDowager of Huntington, she evidently gave her time and interest in\r\nher retirement to the studies begun under Mrs. Makin (possibly in the\r\nPutney Schools before 1649), who says of her in 1673: \"I am forbidden\r\nto mention the Countess _Dowager of Huntington_ (instructed\r\nsometimes by Mrs. Makin) howe well she understands _Latin_, _Greek_,\r\n_Hebrew_, _French_ and _Spanish_; or what a proficient she is in\r\nArts, subservient to Divinity, in which (if I durst I would tell you)\r\nshe excells.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. BATHSUA MAKIN\r\n\r\n\"Facsimile copy from an almost unique print by Marshall.\" From an\r\nengraving in Woodburn's _Gallery of Rare Portraits_, 1816, Vol. II,\r\npage 39.]\r\n\r\nMrs. Makin makes enthusiastic mention of other learned ladies, but\r\ndoes not make it clear whether they had been under her instruction.\r\nLady Mildmay could not, she says, be justly omitted. Then there\r\nwas Mrs. Thorold, daughter of Lady Carr in Lincolnshire, who was\r\n\"excellent in Philosophy, and all sorts of Learning.\" She cites also\r\n\"Dr. Love's daughters,\"[402] as \"still fresh in the memory of men\"\r\nfor their \"Worth and Excellency in Learning.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1649, John Evelyn and a party of ladies visited \"the\r\nschools or colleges for gentlewomen\" at Putney. In all probability\r\nMrs. Makin had charge of this institution. Certainly no other known\r\nEnglishwoman would have been so competent, or would have had such\r\nprestige as a school-mistress, and her _Essay_ of 1673 shows that\r\nshe remained in the educational field. Accompanying the _Essay_ is a\r\n_Prospectus_ for a school she had recently opened. \"If any enquire\r\nwhere this education may be performed, such may be informed that a\r\nschool is lately erected for Gentlewomen, at Tottenham High Cross,\r\nwithin four miles of London, on the road to Ware, where Mrs. Makin\r\nis governess who was formerly tutoress to the Princess Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter to King Charles the First. Where, by the blessing of God,\r\nGentlewomen may be instructed in the _Principles_ of _religion_, and\r\nin all manner of sober and virtuous Education: more particularly\r\nin all things ordinarily taught in other schools.\" These things\r\n\"ordinarily taught in other schools\" are listed as \"Dancing, Musick,\r\nSinging, Writing, Keeping accompts.\" Half the time in Mrs. Makin's\r\nschool was to be spent on this portion of the curriculum. The\r\nother half was to be \"employed in gaining the _Latin_ and _French_\r\ntongues.\" Greek, Hebrew, Italian, and Spanish were optional subjects,\r\nbut were offered by the Governess who had a \"competent knowledge\"\r\nof all of them. The language requirements could not have been\r\nextensive since \"Gentlewomen of eight or nine years old, that can\r\nread well, may be instructed in a year or two (according to their\r\nparts) in the _Latin_ and _French_ tongues.\" Something in the way of\r\nnatural history was attempted. Mrs. Makin announces, \"_Repositories_\r\nalso for Visibles shall be prepared; by which, from beholding the\r\nthings, Gentlewomen may learn the Names, Natures, Values, and Use\r\nof _Herbs_, _Shrubs_, _Trees_, _Mineral-pieces_, _Metals_, and\r\n_Stones_,\" a sort of laboratory course in botany and mineralogy.\r\nAstronomy, geography, and especially arithmetic and history were\r\nalso offered in a \"general\" way. Domestic science was not omitted,\r\nthough oddly bound up with a course in art: \"Those that please may\r\nlearn Limning, Preserving, Pastry, and Cookery.\" The principle of\r\nelectives was in full force. \"Those that think one language enough\r\nfor a Woman, may forbear the Languages, and learn only Experimental\r\nPhilosophy.\" In fact, students were allowed to take \"more or fewer\"\r\nof the courses offered as they might incline. The regular rate was\r\ntwenty pounds per annum, but a \"competent improvement in the Tongues,\r\nand the other things aforementioned\" was to command an additional\r\nfee. Very astutely Mrs. Makin constituted the parents the judge as\r\nto the excellency of their children's attainments. The notice closes\r\nwith this fair offer: \"Those that think these Things Improbable,\r\nor Impracticable may have further account every _Tuesday_, at Mr.\r\nMason's Coffee-house, in Cornhill, near the Royal Exchange; and\r\n_Thursdays_, at the 'Bolt and Tun,' in Fleet Street, between the\r\nhours of three and six in the afternoon, by some person whom Mrs.\r\nMakin shall appoint.\"[403]\r\n\r\nThis course of study, desultory, inchoate, fragmentary, as it is,\r\nis nevertheless of great historic interest. It is the first known\r\nattempt to organize a scheme of definite and solid study for girls.\r\nHowever superficial the work, it was based on a novel and important\r\nconception of the value of genuine knowledge in languages and science\r\nfor girls as well as for boys. It must have been as doubtful and\r\nepoch-making an event in a community to have its girls sent to\r\nTottenham High Cross, as for the earliest students to go to Vassar.\r\nUnfortunately the inception of this school is all we know about it.\r\nA knowledge of its actual work, its success, a list of its students,\r\nwould serve as an illuminating commentary on the general attitude\r\ntowards learning for girls in the last quarter of the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThat Mrs. Makin expected opposition is shown by the remarkable\r\n_Essay_ that was issued with her _Prospectus_. The full title\r\nof the _Essay_ is, _An Essay to Revive the Antient Education of\r\nGentlewomen, in Religion, Manners, Arts, & Tongues, with an Answer\r\nto the Objections against this Way of Education. London, Printed by\r\nJ. D. to be sold by Tho. Parkhurst, at the Bible and Crown, at the\r\nlower end of Cheapside._ 1673. In her opening paragraphs Mrs. Makin\r\nrecognizes that an age in which \"Learning and Virtue are counted\r\nPedantick Things, fit only for the Vulgar\" is not a propitious time\r\nto undertake an advanced scheme for the education of girls. She\r\ntrenchantly summarizes the prevalent attitude towards learned women;\r\nand then bravely sets forth her own creed. She also emphasizes the\r\nmodesty of her demands:\r\n\r\n  Custom, when it is inveterate, hath a mighty influence: it hath\r\n  the force of Nature itself. The Barbarous custom to breed Women\r\n  low, is grown general amongst us, and hath prevailed so far, that\r\n  it is verily believed (especially amongst a cort of debauched\r\n  Sots) that Women are not endued with such reason, as Men; nor\r\n  capable of improvement by Education, as they are. It is lookt\r\n  upon as a monstrous thing, to pretend the contrary. A Learned\r\n  Woman is thought to be a Comet, that bodes Mischief, when ever\r\n  it appears. To offer to the World the liberal Education of Women\r\n  is to deface the Image of God in Man, it will make Women so\r\n  high, and men so low, like Fire in the House-tops it will set\r\n  the whole world in a Flame. These things and worse than these,\r\n  are commonly talked of, and verily believed by many, who think\r\n  themselves wise Men: to contradict these is a bold attempt;\r\n  where the Attempter must expect to meet with much opposition....\r\n  I verily think, Women were formerly Educated in the knowledge\r\n  of Arts and Tongues, and by their Education, many did rise to\r\n  a great height in Learning. Were Women thus educated now, I am\r\n  confident the advantage would be very great: the Women would have\r\n  Honour and Pleasure, their Relations Profit, and the whole Nation\r\n  Advantage.... Were a competent number of Schools erected to\r\n  Educate Ladyes ingenuously, methinks I see how ashamed Men would\r\n  be of their Ignorance, and how industrious the next Generation\r\n  would be to wipe off their Reproach. I expect to meet with many\r\n  Scoffes and Taunts from inconsiderate and illiterate Men, that\r\n  prize their own Lusts and Pleasure more than your Profit and\r\n  Content. I shall be the less concern'd at these, so long as I am\r\n  in your favour; and this discourse may be a Weapon in your hands\r\n  to defend yourselves, whilst you endeavour to polish your Souls,\r\n  that you may glorify God, and answer the end of your Creation,\r\n  to be meet helps to your Husbands. Let not your Ladiships be\r\n  offended, that I do not (as some have wittily done) plead for\r\n  Female Preëminence. To ask too much is the way to be denied all.\r\n  God hath made Man the Head, if you be educated and instructed, as\r\n  I propose, I am sure you will acknowledge it, and be satisfied\r\n  that you are helps, that your Husbands do consult and advise with\r\n  you (which if you be wise they will be glad of) and that your\r\n  Husbands have the casting-Voice, in whose determinations you will\r\n  acquiesce.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of the _Essay_ is addressed to a \"much-honoured and\r\nworthy friend\" who has expressed considerable doubt as to the wisdom\r\nof her educational projects. The tone of his letter is indicated by\r\nthe following summary:\r\n\r\n  Your great question is, Whether to breed up Women in Arts and\r\n  Tongues, is not a mere new Device, never before practised in the\r\n  World. This you doubt the more: Because Women are of low Parts,\r\n  and not capable of Improvement by this Education. If they could\r\n  be improved you doubt, whether it would benefit them? If it\r\n  would benefit them, you enquire where such Education may be had?\r\n  or, whether they must go to School with Boys? to be made twice\r\n  more impudent than learned. At last you muster up a Legion of\r\n  Objections.\r\n\r\nThese doubts and objections are then discussed _seriatim_. To\r\nestablish her contention that women have been educated in arts and\r\nsciences in the past she gives an unchronological, uncritical list of\r\nwomen who attained distinction in Greece and Rome and in Bible times.\r\nMiriam, \"a great poet and philosopher,\" the women who danced before\r\nDavid (singing songs \"compos'd it's like by themselves\"), Huldah the\r\nProphetess, \"who dwelt (we may suppose) in a college where women were\r\nbred up in good literature\"; Anna and Phebe; Triphena, Triphosa, and\r\nPersis; Priscilla who instructed Apollos; Timothy's mother Eunice and\r\ngrandmother Lois; and Philip's four daughters, make up from Sacred\r\nWrit a list intended to allay the anxieties of a devout churchman\r\nas to the effect of learning on female piety. Mrs. Makin was really\r\nforced to get as many Biblical recruits as possible, since her\r\nopponents regularly massed their forces in the Garden of Eden with\r\nthe Sin of Eve as their impregnable fort.\r\n\r\nTo the lay mind examples from classic lands might prove\r\nauthoritative, hence there follows a list of Greek and Roman ladies\r\nof learning. If the heroes of ancient story are but idealized\r\nrepresentations of actual men, why, reasons Mrs. Makin, may we not\r\nsuppose some actual wise women as the begetters of the legends\r\nof Minerva, the Muses, and the Sibyls? From history she cites\r\n\"Sempronia, Cornelia, Lelia, Mutia, Cleobulina, Cassandra, Terentia,\r\nHortensia, Sulpitia, Portia, Helvitia, Enonia, Paula, Albina, Pella,\r\nJenobia, Voleria, Proba, Eudocia, Claudia,\" and many others; a list\r\ntoo undiscriminating to be convincing, but certainly creditable to\r\nMrs. Makin's industrious learning. After this wide preliminary sweep,\r\nMrs. Makin takes up different realms of attainment. \"Women have\r\nbeen good Linguists\"; \"Women have been good Oratours\"; \"Women have\r\nunderstood Logic\"; \"Women have been profound Philosophers\"; \"Some\r\nWomen have understood the Mathematics\"; \"Women have been good Poets\";\r\n\"Women have been good Divines\"--such are the theses she is prepared\r\nto defend. The mathematics are most thinly provided with examples,\r\nHypatia of Alexandria and \"A Lady of late, her name I have forgot,\"\r\nwho printed divers tables, being the only instances she can summon.\r\nThe richest assemblage of names comes under the linguists and the\r\npoets. The purpose of this ardent and prolonged search of times past\r\nand present is to show that women are not by act of creation always\r\nof \"low parts\"; that some, indeed, have approached the standards\r\nset by men. This being the case, women should have full educational\r\nopportunities. Mrs. Makin is careful, however, to hedge in even\r\nthis proposition with qualifications. Education belongs only to\r\nthe Christian maid, to the maid of excellent mind, to the maid of\r\nwealth and leisure. A woman's education is for her own development\r\nand pleasure and for the service of her family. Any social, public,\r\nutilitarian use of it is not for a moment contemplated. A further\r\nqualification is that education is not absolutely essential:\r\n\r\n  I do not mean that it is necessary to the _esse_, to the\r\n  _subsistence_, or to the salvation of women, to be thus educated.\r\n  Those that are mean in the world have not the opportunity\r\n  for this education. Those that are of low parts, though they\r\n  have opportunity, cannot reach this. _Ex quovis ligno not fit\r\n  Minerva._ My meaning is, persons that God hath blessed with the\r\n  things of this world, that have competent natural parts, ought to\r\n  be educated in knowledge. That is, it is much better they should\r\n  spend the time of their youth to be competently instructed in\r\n  those things usually taught to gentlewomen at schools, and the\r\n  over-plus of their time to be spent in gaining arts and tongues\r\n  and useful knowledge, rather than to trifle away so many precious\r\n  minutes, merely to polish their hands and feet, to curl their\r\n  locks, to dress and trim their bodies.\r\n\r\nWith these limitations the proposition may be allowed to stand that\r\nthe virtuous, talented woman of leisure should be granted educational\r\nadvantages. But there are objections still to be met. The more\r\nimportant of these may be summarized with Mrs. Makin's answers:\r\n\r\n  1. \"If we bring up our Daughters to Learning no Persons will\r\n  adventure to Marry them.\"\r\n\r\n  Answer: Learned men would surely choose learned wives, and it\r\n  will be long before there are learned women enough to overstock\r\n  the market.\r\n\r\n  2. \"When Solomon praised the good housewife no mention was made\r\n  of her learning.\"\r\n\r\n  Answer: The daily tasks of Solomon's housewife required\r\n  considerable knowledge. \"To buy wool and flax, to dye scarlet\r\n  and purple, requires skill in Natural Philosophy. To consider a\r\n  field, the quantity and quality, requires knowledge in Geometry.\r\n  To plant a vineyard, requires understanding in Husbandry. She\r\n  could not merchandise without Arithmetic. She could not govern so\r\n  great a family well without knowledge in Politics and Economics.\r\n  She could not look well to the ways of her household, except\r\n  she understood Physic and Chirurgery. She could not open her\r\n  mouth with wisdom and have in her tongue the law of kindness\r\n  without Grammar, Rhetoric and Logic.\" But at the best, Solomon's\r\n  good housewife seems to Mrs. Makin hardly more than \"an honest,\r\n  well-bred, ingenious, industrious Dutchwoman,\" not at all the\r\n  sort of talented gentlewoman of the leisure classes for whom the\r\n  new liberal education is to be provided.\r\n\r\n  3. \"Women are of ill Natures, and will abuse their Education.\"\r\n\r\n  Answer: Men also abuse their Education.\r\n\r\n  4. \"They will be proud and not obey their Husbands; they will be\r\n  pragmatick and boast of their Parts and Improvements.\"\r\n\r\n  Answer: \"To this I Answer; What is said of Philosophy, is true\r\n  of Knowledge; a little Philosophy carries a man from God, but a\r\n  great deal brings him back again; a little knowledge, like windy\r\n  Bladders, puffs up, but a good measure of true knowledge, like\r\n  Ballast in a Ship, settles down, and makes a person more even\r\n  in his station; 't is not knowing too much, but too little that\r\n  causes the irregularity.\"\r\n\r\n  5. \"The end of Learning is Publick Business\" in which women have\r\n  no concern.\r\n\r\n  Answer: The private ends of learning are as important as the\r\n  public ends. Moreover, this objection would apply to all men in\r\n  private life.\r\n\r\n  6. \"Women do not desire Learning.\"\r\n\r\n  Answer: \"Neither do many Boys.\"\r\n\r\n  7. \"Women are of Low Parts.\"\r\n\r\n  Answer: \"So are many Men.\"\r\n\r\n  8. Women are soft, tender, delicate, weak.\r\n\r\n  Answer: Then strengthen them by Education.\r\n\r\n  9. A learned gentlewoman is ridiculous because contrary to custom.\r\n\r\n  Answer: This custom has a bad ground. Men wish women to be fools,\r\n  that they may remain slaves. A bad custom should be broken that\r\n  good customs may prevail.\r\n\r\n  10. The final and crucial objection is elaborately stated:\r\n  \"How shall time be found to teach children these things here\r\n  proposed? Boys go to school ordinarily from seven till sixteen or\r\n  seventeen, and not above one in four attain so much knowledge in\r\n  the Tongues as to be admitted into the University, where no great\r\n  accuracy is required, and they learn nothing else usually besides\r\n  a little History. Gentlewomen will not ordinarily be sent out so\r\n  soon, nor is it convenient they should continue so long. Further,\r\n  half their time, it is supposed, must be spent in learning those\r\n  things that concern them as Women. Twice as many things are\r\n  proposed to be taught Girls in half the time, as Boyes do learn,\r\n  which is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the article is taken up with an analysis of Lilly's\r\n_Grammar_, to show how slow and burdensome and distasteful are its\r\nmethods, and to an analysis of the short cuts to knowledge devised\r\nby Mrs. Makin and Mr. Lewis. For instance, Lilly's long rule for\r\nsubstantives is simplified into, \"Any word with _a_, _an_, or _the_\r\nin front of it is a substantive.\" If you wish to distinguish between\r\na noun and an adjective you have but to note that nouns change\r\nwhen you make a plural, adjectives do not. And so on with many\r\nshrewd little tricks of learning whereby the parts of speech may\r\nbe known at a glance, the nature of said parts of speech not being\r\nin question. The whole of Mrs. Makin's scope and plan of education\r\nseems superficial and uncoördinated until seen in the light of the\r\ncontemporary training of boys as she describes it. Then her system\r\nseems alive and energetic in its effort to slough off non-essentials.\r\n\r\nIn passing, Mrs. Makin frequently utters wise and far-seeing opinions\r\nconcerning the education of girls.\r\n\r\n  If any desire to know what they should be instructed in? I\r\n  answer: I cannot tell where to begin to admit Women, nor from\r\n  what part of Learning to exclude them, in regard of their\r\n  Capacities. The whole _Encyclopoedia_ of Learning may be useful\r\n  some way or other to them. \"Grammar, Rhetorick, Logick, Physick,\r\n  the Tongues, Mathematics, Geography, History, Musick, Painting,\r\n  Poetry\"--all of these should be open to women, and all could be\r\n  advantageously used by them.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the pleasures of the student she says, \"Delight and\r\nPleasure are the attendants on Learning.\"\r\n\r\n  There is no pleasure greater than what is founded in Knowledge;\r\n  it is the First Fruits of Heaven, and a glimpse of that Glory we\r\n  afterwards expect. There is in all an innate desire of knowing,\r\n  and the satisfying this is the greatest pleasure. Men are very\r\n  cruel, that give them leave to look at a distance, only to know\r\n  they do not know; to make any thus to tantalize is a great\r\n  torment.\r\n\r\nShe is especially scornful of the vain and frivolous women of that\r\nfrivolous age, those women whose time is spent in \"making Points for\r\nBravery, in dressing and trimming themselves like Bartholomew-Babies,\r\nin Painting and Dancing, in making Flowers of Coloured Straw, and\r\nbuilding Houses of stained Paper, and such like vanities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poulain de la Barre]\r\n\r\nA book nearly contemporaneous with Mrs. Makin's _Prospectus_ is\r\nentitled _The Woman as Good as the Man, or the Equality of Both\r\nSexes. Written originally in French and translated into English by\r\nA. L._ The French original was by Poulain de la Barre whose _De\r\nl'Egalité des deux Sexes_ was published in 1673. The translation by\r\nA. L. came out in 1677. The Preface by the author and that by the\r\ntranslator show that they enter upon their work with considerable\r\ntrepidation, knowing that they write against the general view. The\r\nprobable opponents are classified as \"all the Ignorant and most\r\nof the Learned,\" but the author proceeds valiantly on his mission\r\nof enlightenment. \"Men,\" he says, \"have always kept women in\r\nsubjection,\" moved thereto by a \"secret Instinct,\" as if they had for\r\ntheir own dominance \"Letters-Patent from the Author of Nature.\" Women\r\nhave likewise accepted the doctrine of their own inferiority so that\r\ndependence and subjection have come to seem their normal condition.\r\nM. de la Barre states the prevalent idea and his own radical\r\ndeparture from it in the following passage:\r\n\r\n  Let every Man (in particular) be asked his Thoughts of Women\r\n  (in general) and that he would surely confess his Mind; he will\r\n  tell you without doubt, That they were not made but for Man;\r\n  That they are fit for nothing, but to Nurse and Breed little\r\n  Children in their Low Ages; and to mind the House. It may be the\r\n  more Ingenious will add, That there are many Women that have\r\n  indeed Parts, and Conduct; but that even they who seem to have\r\n  most, when they are nearly examined, discover still some-what\r\n  that speaks their Sex: That they have neither Solidity, nor\r\n  Constancy; nor that depth of Judgment which they think to find in\r\n  themselves: And that it hath been an effect of Divine Providence,\r\n  and Wisdom of Men, to have barred them from Sciences, Government,\r\n  and Offices: That it would be a pleasant thing indeed, to\r\n  see a Lady in the Chair (in quality of a Professor) teaching\r\n  _Rhetorick_, or _Medicine_; marching along the Streets, followed\r\n  by Officers, and Sergeants; putting in Execution Laws: Playing\r\n  the part of a Counsellour; pleading before Judges: Seated on a\r\n  Bench, to Administer Justice in Supream Courts: Leading of an\r\n  Army; giving Battel; and Speaking before States, and Princes, as\r\n  the Head of an Embassy.\r\n\r\n  I do confess, such Practices would surprize us; but for no other\r\n  reason, but that of Novelty. For, if in modelling of states and\r\n  establishing the different Offices that compose them, Women had\r\n  been likewise called to Functions; we should have been as much\r\n  accustomed to have seen them in Dignity, as they are to see us.\r\n  And should have found it no more strange to have seen a Lady on a\r\n  Throne, than a Woman in a Shop.[404]\r\n\r\nM. de la Barre admits that many women may properly be accused of\r\n\"Idleness, Softness, and Ignorance,\" but gives the astonishingly\r\nmodern explanation that no fair estimate of the ability of women\r\ncan be made until they have been trained by right education and\r\nstimulated by public responsibility and opportunity. He believes that\r\nif women \"made it their business to study Law, they would succeed in\r\nit (at least) as well as we.\" \"Women seem born to practise Physick.\"\r\nThey would excel as \"Pastour or Minister in the Church ... and\r\nthere can be nothing else but custome shewn, which remove _Women_\r\ntherefrom.... And if men were accustomed to see _Women_ in a Pulpit,\r\nthey would be no more startled thereat, than the _Women_ are at the\r\nsight of men.\" Women if rightly educated would show peculiar aptitude\r\nfor teaching.\r\n\r\n  If _Women_ had studyed in the Universities with men, or in\r\n  others appointed for them in particular, they might have entered\r\n  into Degrees, and taken the title of Master of Arts, Doctor of\r\n  Divinity, Medicine, Civil, and Cannon Law: And their genius so\r\n  advantageously fitting them to learn, would dispose them to teach\r\n  with success. They would find methods, and insinuating biasses,\r\n  to instil their Doctrine; they would discover the strength and\r\n  weakness of their Schollars, to proportion themseves to their\r\n  reach, and the facility which they have to express themselves;\r\n  and, [this] which is one of the most excellent talents of a good\r\n  Master, would compleat and render them admirable Mistresses.[405]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason \"why a _Woman_ of sound Judgment and\r\nUnderstanding, might not take the chaire in a court of Justice, and\r\npreside in all other companies.\" There are no positions of public\r\nauthority from the throne to the humblest office of state that should\r\nnot be open to women. Even \"the military Art hath nothing beyond\r\nothers, whereof _Women_ are not capable.\"\r\n\r\nThat women may become learned is beyond dispute, and they are the\r\nmore to be praised because of the difficulties they have overcome:\r\n\r\n  How many Ladies have there been, and how many are there still,\r\n  who ought to be placed amongst the number of the Learned, if we\r\n  assigne them not a Higher Sphear? The Age wherein we live hath\r\n  produced more of these, than all the past. And as they have in\r\n  all things run parallel with _Men_, upon some Particular Reasons,\r\n  they ought more to be esteemed than they: For, it behoved them\r\n  to surmount the Softness wherein their Sex is bred, renounce\r\n  the Pleasures and Idleness, to which Custom had condemned them,\r\n  overcome certain public Impediments that removed them from\r\n  Study, and to get above those disadvantagious Notions, which the\r\n  Vulgar conceive of the Learned, besides, those of their own Sex\r\n  in general: All this they have performed. And whether it be,\r\n  that these Difficulties have rendered their Wit more quick and\r\n  penetrating, or that these Qualities are the peculiar of their\r\n  Nature, they have [proportionably] made Progress and Advancements\r\n  beyond _Men_.[406]\r\n\r\nThese may be regarded as exceptional women, but \"there are infinite\r\nnumbers of _Women_, which could have done no less, had their\r\nAdvantages been Equal.\" But the training given to girls make them\r\nbelieve that beauty and fine clothes should be their only interests.\r\nTheir education seldom goes beyond writing and reading, and their\r\nlibrary consists of a few little books of devotion.\r\n\r\n  In all that which is taught to _Women_, do we see anything that\r\n  tends to solid instruction? It seems, on the contrary, that men\r\n  have agreed on this sort of education, of purpose to abase their\r\n  courage, darken their mind, and to fill it only with vanity, and\r\n  fopperies.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that \"Learning would render _Women_ more Wicked and\r\nProud.\" But only false knowledge can produce so bad an effect. True\r\nknowledge makes a woman humble and virtuous. It actually \"choaks\"\r\nsome men to find women eager after knowledge. These men have \"forged\r\nto themselves that Women ought not to Study,\" and they \"stand upon\r\ntheir Points, when Women demand to be informed of that which is\r\nLearned by Books.\" But since \"Ignorance is the most irksome Slavery,\"\r\nand knowing the truth is a way out of it, all women who seek that way\r\nshould be praised, not blamed.\r\n\r\n\"We may [then] with Assurance, exhort Ladies to apply themselves\r\nto Study; without having Respect to the little Reasons of those\r\nwho would undertake to divert them there-from. Since they have a\r\nMind (as well as We) capable of knowing of Truth ... they ought to\r\nput themselves in condition of avoyding the Reproach, of having\r\nstifled a Talent, which they might put to use.\" Learning cannot\r\nbe counted useless to women even if they do not publicly use it.\r\nIt is a personal right and necessity like \"Felicity and Vertue.\"\r\n\"The Spring of reason is not limited; it hath in all men an equal\r\nJurisdiction.... Truth and Knowledge are goods that admit of no\r\nprescription.\" And, finally, the economy of the world demands that\r\none half its mentality should not be debarred from the search after\r\nTruth.\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of M. Poulain de la Barre might be put in question\r\nby the fact that he wrote in 1675 a book entitled _De l'Excellence\r\ndes Hommes contre l'Egalité des Sexes_, but the earlier treatise\r\nmaintained its popularity, for it was republished in 1676, 1690,\r\n1692. Of the English translation but one edition appeared, nor does\r\nit seem to have been well known in the seventeenth century. Mary\r\nAstell makes no use of it, perhaps because it was too radical and\r\nuncompromising in its demand. Certainly no other defense of feminism\r\neven approached the work of M. de la Barre in the relentless logic\r\nwith which it carried fundamental assumptions into the practical\r\naffairs of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. George Hickes (1642-1715)]\r\n\r\nFrom Marie de Jars to Anna van Schurman, and then to Bathsua Makin\r\nis a regular and recognized progression of influence. I am unable\r\nto trace any direct influence from Mrs. Makin, though her prestige\r\nand the number of her aristocratic pupils must have made her school\r\none of the important factors in establishing new ideas. At any rate,\r\nby whatever influences brought about, we have, after about 1680,\r\nseveral significant discussions of liberal education for woman. One\r\nof the earliest and most surprising of these comes in a sermon by Dr.\r\nGeorge Hickes. Its full title is, _A Sermon Preached at the Church\r\nof St. Bridget, on Easter, Tuesday, being the first of April, 1684.\r\nBefore the Right Honourable Sir Henry Tulse, Lord Mayor of London\r\nand Honourable Court of Alderman, Together with the Governors of the\r\nHospital, upon the Subject of Alms-giving. By George Hickes, D. D.\r\nDean of Worcester, and Chaplain in Ordinary to his Majesty._\r\n\r\nAt the close of this sermon on the reasons for alms-giving Dr. Hickes\r\nemphasizes the great obligation resting on those \"Who heap up Riches,\r\nand can not tell who shall gather them, I mean those to whom God hath\r\ngiven great Estates, and no Children.\" Such people seem to him set\r\napart by Providence for the endowing of works of public beneficence.\r\nIn a comprehensive analysis of the practical ways in which they could\r\nuse their wealth we come upon the following remarkable suggestion:\r\n\r\n  I will also put you in mind of establishing a Found for Endowing\r\n  of poor Maids, who have lived so many years in Service, and of\r\n  building Schools, or Colleges for the Education of young Women,\r\n  much like unto those in the Universities, for the Education\r\n  of young Men, but with some alteration in the Discipline, and\r\n  Occonomy, as the nature of such an Institution would require.\r\n\r\n  Such Colleges might be so ordered, as to become security to your\r\n  Daughters against all the hazard to which they are exposed at\r\n  private Schools, and likewise a security to the Government,\r\n  that the Daughters of the Land should be bred up according\r\n  to the religion now established in it, to the unconceivable\r\n  advantage of the Publick, in rooting out _Enthusiasme_, with her\r\n  Daughter _Schisme_, both of which are upheld by nothing among\r\n  us as much, as by the Women, who are so silly and deceiveable\r\n  for want of Ingenious and Orthodox Education, and not for want\r\n  of Parts. Methinks the Rich and Honourable Ladies of the Church\r\n  of _England_, the _Elect Ladies_ of her Apostolical Communion\r\n  should be zealous to begin, and carry on such a work, as this;\r\n  which upon more accounts than I have mentioned, would make the\r\n  Daughters of _Israel_ be glad, and the Daughters of _Judah_ and\r\n  _Jerusalem_ rejoyce.\r\n\r\nHad Dr. Hickes read Anna van Schurman's _May the Christian Maid be a\r\nScholar?_ Or had he seen the _Prospectus_ and _Essay_ of Mrs. Makin\r\nwhich had appeared eleven years before he preached his Sermon to the\r\nLord Mayor?\r\n\r\nAmong the clergy of the English Church the Reverend George Hickes\r\nmust take rank as the earliest and one of the most important\r\ndefenders of higher education for women. His Easter sermon antedated\r\nMary Astell, and his claim was more generous and daring than hers. In\r\n1710, when he published _Controversial Letters_, he included letters\r\nfrom Susanna Hopton and Lady Gratiana Carew, and he considered them\r\nvaluable aids in the presentation of religious truth. It was he who\r\ncalled Mrs. Bovey \"the Christian Hypatia,\" and he was the chief\r\nencourager of Elizabeth Elstob.\r\n\r\nBesides these individual manifestations of approval Dr. Hickes\r\ncontributed to the cause of the right education of girls by a\r\ntranslation of Fénelon's _Traité de l'éducation des filles_ (1688),\r\nunder the title _Instructions for the Education of a Daughter,\r\nby the Author of Telemachus. To which is Added, A Small Tract of\r\nInstructions for the Conduct of Young Ladies of the Highest Rank.\r\nWith Suitable Devotions Annexed. Done into English and Revised by\r\nGeorge Hicks._ In putting the French treatise into an English dress\r\nDr. Hickes has not hesitated to make such changes as would bring\r\nthe book closer to English needs. This book was so widely read and\r\nso influential in England that rather full extracts may profitably\r\nbe given. But it should be noted in advance that the general tone\r\nof this treatise is much more conventional, much less liberal, in\r\nits ideas of education and of opportunity for self-expression than\r\nwas Dr. Hickes in his Easter sermon, and in his encouragement of\r\nindividual learned women. But it must be remembered that here he is\r\nnot writing for mature women with superior minds, but for young girls\r\nof high social rank to whom he wishes to recommend the most exalted\r\nideals of character, behavior, and general culture. Modest indeed are\r\nthe requirements in exact learning:\r\n\r\n  Teach her to _Read_ and _Write_ correctly. It is shameful, but\r\n  ordinary, to see Gentlewomen, who have both Wit and Politeness,\r\n  not able yet to pronounce well what they read; they either\r\n  hesitate, or else chant, as it were, in reading; whereas they\r\n  ought to pronounce their Words with a plain and natural Tone,\r\n  such as is also firm and uniform. They are still more grossly\r\n  deficient in Orthography, or in Spelling right, and in the\r\n  manner of forming or connecting Letters in Writing. Accustom her\r\n  then, from the first, to make her Lines strait, and to have her\r\n  Character neat and legible.\r\n\r\n  It would also be requisite for her to understand a little\r\n  _Grammar_ of her Native Language; by which it is not meant,\r\n  she should be taught by Rule, as Boys are, _Latin_: Use her\r\n  only without Affectation, not to take one Tense for another; to\r\n  express herself in proper Terms; to explain clearly her Thoughts,\r\n  with Order, and after a short and concise manner. Thus will you\r\n  put her into a Method, by which she may teach her own Children\r\n  afterwards to speak well and truly, without any formal Study.\r\n  It is well known, that in Old Rome, Sempronia the Mother of the\r\n  _Gracchi_, contributed very much to the forming of the Eloquence\r\n  of her Sons, who became afterwards so great Men.\r\n\r\n  She ought also to understand the Four first great Rules of\r\n  Arithmetic; you may make good use of them, in teaching her\r\n  thereby to keep your Accompts. This is indeed a troublesome\r\n  Employment to a great many; but an Habit from her Childhood,\r\n  joyn'd with the Easiness of keeping readily, by the Help of these\r\n  Rules, all Sorts of Accompts, tho' never so intricate, will very\r\n  much diminish this Dislike. Now't is sufficiently known how much\r\n  Exactness of Accompts conduces to the good Order in Families.\r\n\r\n  After these instructions, which are to hold the first Rank, I\r\n  believe it will not be quite useless, to allow young Ladies\r\n  according to their Leisure, and their Capacity, the _reading_\r\n  of some select prophane Authors, that have nothing Dangerous in\r\n  them for the Passions. This is the Means to give them a Distaste\r\n  of most Plays and Romances; Give them therefore into their Hands\r\n  _Greek_ and _Roman_ Histories, in the best Translations; they\r\n  will see in them wonderful Instances of Courage, of Faithfulness,\r\n  of Generosity, and of the great Contempt of their own private\r\n  Advantage, whenever the Publick was in the Balance. Let them not\r\n  be ignorant of the History of _Britain_, which hath also some\r\n  very great Instances of Brave (no less than of Bad) Actions, that\r\n  hardly any thing in Antiquity will be found to exceed: Those\r\n  Illustrious Patterns which have been set by their own Nation and\r\n  by Persons too of their own Sex, will be apt more strongly to\r\n  influence them.\r\n\r\n  Though _Natural Philosophy_ seems not to be adapted to the\r\n  Understanding of Women, or at least not to fall within the Bounds\r\n  of what concerns their Duty; yet _Moral Philosophy_ is, upon both\r\n  Accounts, to be studied by them.[407] _Languages_ are next to\r\n  be considered. It is commonly believ'd in _France_, that a Lady\r\n  that would be well-bred, must learn _Italian_ and _Spanish_; as\r\n  with us, _French_ at least. I see nothing of less Benefit than\r\n  this Study, unless it be where the Lady is oblig'd to it on\r\n  account of Business.... Some, and those the farthest in the World\r\n  from all Pedantry, think it would not be unreasonable for this\r\n  End, to have them learn a little _Latin_. For which, there may\r\n  be a great deal more Reason in those Countries, where this is\r\n  look'd on as the Language of the Church; it being an inestimable\r\n  Fruit and Consolation, say they, to understand the Words of the\r\n  Divine Service, whereat one is oblig'd to attend so often. Yet\r\n  doubtless, every where the Advantages of it are not small, if but\r\n  accompanied with Humility, and season'd with Prudence.\r\n\r\nTo this restricted course of study is added most careful advice as to\r\ngeneral reading with a particular caution against romances. If Dr.\r\nHickes's advice had prevailed Steele's Biddy Tipkin and Mrs. Lennox's\r\nArabella would never have existed:\r\n\r\n  But, on the contrary, Young Persons, and Women especially,\r\n  without Instruction and Application, have always a roving\r\n  Imagination. For want of solid Nourishment, their Curiosity\r\n  violently turns them towards Vain and Dangerous Objects. Such\r\n  as have a little Capacity, are in Danger to set up for Wits;\r\n  they read, for this, all the Books that may feed their Vanity;\r\n  they are extremely affected with Romances, with Plays, with\r\n  the Relations of Chimerical Adventures, in which profane Love\r\n  bears a mighty Share; they fill their Minds with empty Notions;\r\n  and, using themselves to the Magnificent Language of Heroes, or\r\n  Heroins, in Romances, they spoil themselves hereby for Converse\r\n  in the World: For all these fine airy Sentiments, these generous\r\n  Passions, these strange Adventures, which the Author of the\r\n  Romance, or Play, hath invented merely for Pleasure, bear no sort\r\n  of proportion, either to the True _Motives_, which are generally\r\n  the Springs of our Actions in the World, and upon which all our\r\n  Affairs do turn; or to the _Mistakes_, which are commonly met\r\n  with in all that is here undertaken.\r\n\r\n  A poor raw Girl, whose Head is fill'd with the moving and\r\n  surprising Strains, which have charmed her in her Reading, is\r\n  astonished, not to find in the World real Persons, who may\r\n  answer to these Romantick Heroes. Fain would she live like those\r\n  imaginary Princesses, who are in the Romances, that is, always\r\n  charming, always adored, always above all kind of Want: What a\r\n  Disgust must it be then, for her to descend from this Heroical\r\n  State, down to the meanest Parts and Offices of Housewifery.\r\n\r\nA second limit is set in cases where the roving imagination may carry\r\nyoung women to subjects too high for them:\r\n\r\n  Some carry their Curiosity yet much farther still, and set\r\n  themselves even to decide Matters of Religion, as much as if\r\n  they had studied in the Schools of Divinity twice Seven Years;\r\n  and with a Magisterial Air, are for determining some of the\r\n  most Knotty Questions that divide Men of the greatest Learning\r\n  and Capacity; and for settling the Bounds of Truth betwixt the\r\n  several contending Parties, as if they were capable of the\r\n  Employment.\r\n\r\nFrom \"An Address to the Right Honourable the Lady ----, From the\r\nTranslator,\" we get a list of books considered by Dr. Hickes as\r\nadvisable reading for English girls:\r\n\r\n  It must be acknowledg'd, that there is not less difficulty in\r\n  the Chusing good Books to busy one's self withal in _Solitude_,\r\n  than good Friends to Entertain one in _Conversation_. Those\r\n  which I would recommend to a Young Lady, next to the HOLY\r\n  SCRIPTURES, are, THE WHOLE DUTY OF MAN; THE LADY'S CALLING;\r\n  and THE GOVERNMENT OF THE TONGUE. After these let her read\r\n  Dr. Cave's PRIMITIVE CHRISTIANITY, to give her an Idea of the\r\n  Lives and Manners of the Ancient Christians; with which she\r\n  may join his LIVES OF THE APOSTLES, and, A COMPANION FOR THE\r\n  FESTIVALS OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, by Robert Nelson, Esq. She\r\n  ought not likewise to be unacquainted with A SERIOUS PROPOSAL\r\n  TO THE LADIES, FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF THEIR TRUEST AND GREATEST\r\n  INTEREST, in TWO PARTS; nor with THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AS\r\n  PROFESS'D BY A DAUGHTER OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND: These Two,\r\n  being written by one of her own Sex, may probably serve to make\r\n  a deeper Impression upon her, and will be both Instructive and\r\n  Delightful. To these, if you please, you may add, THE LADY'S\r\n  NEW YEARS GIFT; and, JUST MEASURES OF THE PIOUS INSTITUTION\r\n  OF YOUTH, by Mr. Monro. But, chiefly, the Two Volumes of THE\r\n  CHRISTIAN PATTERN, may very Profitably be recommended to her;\r\n  the Christian Exercises and Entertainments, in the Second, she\r\n  will find of very peculiar Service and Consolation to her, in\r\n  all the several Stages of Life; and if she can be brought to be\r\n  in love with the Character herein of _Philothea_, the Work is\r\n  soon done. The _Meditations_ and _Soliloquies_ of St. Augustine,\r\n  deserve likewise to be of the Number of her more intimate\r\n  Companions; together with the DEVOTIONS IN THE ANCIENT WAY OF\r\n  OFFICES, WITH PSALMS, AND HYMNS, AND PRAYERS FOR EVERY DAY IN\r\n  THE WEEK, publish'd by Dr. Hickes: Nothing can be ever sweeter\r\n  or finer than some of the _Meditations_, and particularly the\r\n  _Hymns_. To these let her add a most excellent Book, called,\r\n  THE OLD RELIGION; with the WINTER EVENING CONFERENCES; which,\r\n  together with solid Instruction, will be very divertive: Both by\r\n  Dr. Goodman. That when she approaches the Solemn Assemblies, she\r\n  may do it with that Understanding and Devotion which she ought,\r\n  let her read _Comber_ or _Bennet_ upon the _Liturgy_. That she\r\n  may read the _Scriptures_ in her Closet with a greater Relish,\r\n  let her peruse Mr. _Boyle's Considerations_ on their _Stile_.\r\n  For the _Psalms_, wherein I must needs suppose her particularly\r\n  conversant, she may have _Hatton's Psalter_, or _Patrick's\r\n  Paraphrase_, which are very plain, and will be of excellent Use.\r\n  The rest of the Practical Works of this last Author, will not\r\n  be unworthy her Acquaintance, but especially THE PARABLE OF THE\r\n  PILGRIM, the Pleasantness and Easiness of which will incite her\r\n  to read forward, and will much help to inspire a lovely Idea of\r\n  Religion. For the same Reason, that I recommend the last, I would\r\n  likewise THE MARTYRDOM OF THEODORA, with some few Pieces of like\r\n  Nature. And the TELEMACHUS of our Author will be better, sure,\r\n  for her, than any Romance or Novel besides: This, though written\r\n  in Prose, is perhaps the most compleat Poem that several Ages\r\n  have produced, for the Subject and Disposition of it. She may\r\n  be directed likewise to the _Psyche_ of Dr. _Beaumont_; to Dr.\r\n  _Woodford's Poetical Paraphrases_ on the Psalms and Canticles;\r\n  Sir _Richard Blackmore's Paraphrase_ on Job; the _Davideis_ and\r\n  some of the _Pindaricks_ of Mr. _Cowley_. If she be Curious, her\r\n  Time will not be lost in turning over the best Histories and\r\n  Memoirs. For _Plays_, there is great Danger in giving her but a\r\n  Taste of them, tho' there should be some few that may be read,\r\n  not only Innocently, but Usefully: And great Caution will be\r\n  required, not to be hurt by some that are the best Written, and\r\n  not to fall by them into sundry Inconveniences and Temptations,\r\n  which may not so presently, perhaps, appear; which the Principles\r\n  laid down in this Treatise of _Education_ do sufficiently evince.\r\n  For _Sermons_, at her leisure Hours, when she is disposed to\r\n  read them, there is abundant Choice. Let her not affect to read\r\n  such as are too Learned, or above her Capacity; and especially,\r\n  let her avoid all such as savour of a Party, and that may tend\r\n  to sowre her with Disputes either Civil or Religious. For the\r\n  Study of _Morality_, SENECA'S MORALS, Abstracted by _L'Estrange_,\r\n  is almost the only Piece, that I should offer to her, besides\r\n  the Incomparable Essays of Mr. _Collier_, and his ANTONINUS. I\r\n  mention but a few, among many others excellent in this kind,\r\n  because I would not have her distracted by too great Variety of\r\n  Reading.\r\n\r\nThe final admonition implies the danger always in the background of\r\nthe most liberal eighteenth-century mind, and that is that learning,\r\neven hedged-in and expurgated learning, might make girls bold and\r\nunfeminine:\r\n\r\n  That which remains next, is to win young ladies to beware of the\r\n  Reputation of being _Witty_; such a Reputation being constantly\r\n  attended with very great Perils and Inconveniences to them. For\r\n  if you take not Care hereof, they that are of a brisk lively\r\n  Spirit, will continually be intriguing, will be forward to\r\n  speak of everything, and be criticising on Matters beyond their\r\n  Capacity; while they affect to shew their Wit, and study to be\r\n  applauded when they are but troublesome by their Niceness. If\r\n  you can but give them a Relish for the true Delicacy, they will\r\n  presently be asham'd of this Affectation of Wit and Humour; and\r\n  so will avoid splitting upon those dangerous Shelves, which such\r\n  a Temper is ordinarily exposed to. Show them sweetly that the\r\n  Virgin Delicacy, the less it is touched, is the more admired....\r\n  A Maid ought not to speak but for Necessity; nor then but with an\r\n  Air of Diffidence and Deference: she ought not likewise to talk\r\n  of things which are above the common reach of Young Women, even\r\n  though she, herself, may, perhaps, be instructed in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mary Astell (1666-1739)]\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know whether the next and most pronounced\r\nadvocate of higher education, Mary Astell, had read Dr. Hickes's\r\nsermon. Miss Astell[408] was born in Newcastle in 1666. Her father\r\ndied when she was twelve; the uncle who is supposed to have educated\r\nher died when she was thirteen; her mother died when she was\r\neighteen. Beyond these facts nothing is known of her early life. A\r\nrecord of the education of Anne Killegrew, Anne Kingsmill, and Mary\r\nAstell would be a social document of great significance for the\r\nreign of Charles II. But it was a record too slight to be kept. Of\r\nthe books these young ladies read, the studies they pursued, of the\r\nschools they may have attended, of the tutors they had, we get no\r\nhint. Of the early influences that led them to achievements unusual\r\nin their day and circle we know nothing. When we first meet them\r\ntheir formal education is complete and we can surmise its details\r\nonly by doubtful inferences based on later attainments.\r\n\r\nAt about twenty Mary Astell went to London and there she lived\r\ntill her death in 1731, Chelsea being the part of the city with\r\nwhich she was most definitely associated. There is no available\r\nrecord of the first seven years of her London life. But during this\r\ntime she must have been doing thorough and consecutive reading in\r\nhistory, philosophy, theology, and politics. And she must have read\r\nanalytically, critically, with vigorous independent judgment, for\r\nat twenty-seven she was well ready for the era of controversy on\r\nwhich she then entered. Her style was also so matured in her first\r\npublished work as to indicate a disciplined mind and pen.\r\n\r\nIn 1693-94 she was in correspondence with John Norris concerning his\r\ntheory that God should be the sole object of human love. So acute, so\r\ndevout, so ably expressed, were Miss Astell's letters that Mr. Norris\r\nwon her consent to an anonymous publication of the correspondence\r\nin 1695 under the title, _Letters concerning the love of God_. In\r\nhis Preface Dr. Norris said that he could not express the value he\r\nset upon Miss Astell's letters either as to their ingenuity or their\r\npiety, \"the former of which might make them an entertainment for an\r\nangel, and the latter sufficient (if possible) to make a saint of the\r\nblackest devil.\" He said he had never met any discourses that had so\r\nenlightened his mind and enlarged his heart, had so taken possession\r\nof his spirit, and had exerted such \"a general and commanding\r\ninfluence over his whole soul.\"\r\n\r\nWhile carrying on this discussion with Mr. Norris another subject had\r\nbeen more definitely occupying Miss Astell's active mind, and in 1694\r\nshe had published her most original and important work, _A Serious\r\nProposal to the Ladies for the Advancement of their true and greatest\r\ninterest_. This appeared in July, 1694, and by 1697 the fourth\r\nedition came out. \"By a Lover of her Sex\" was the only indication of\r\nauthorship. In 1700 she published _Some Reflections upon Marriage_,\r\na discussion based on the unhappy experiences of her neighbor in\r\nChelsea, the Duchess of Mazarine. The years 1704-05 show her greatest\r\nactivity. In _Moderation Truly Stated_ (1704) she answered Owen's\r\n_Moderation a Virtue_, and in the Preface discussed Davenant's\r\nrecently published _Essays on Peace and War_. In _A Fair Way with\r\nDissenters and their Patrons_ (1704) she attempted to answer Defoe's\r\n_Shortest Way with Dissenters_, while in a Postscript she carried on\r\nher analysis of Owen's views on Moderation. In _An Impartial Enquiry\r\ninto the Causes of Rebellion and Civil War in this Kingdom_ she took\r\nup another phase of politics--religious controversy, showing herself\r\na believer in Stuart doctrines of Church and State. _The Christian\r\nReligion as Profess'd by a Daughter of the Church of England_ (1705)\r\nshowed the insidious dangers of latitudinarianism and deism within\r\nthe Church, and defended the Christian religion as reasonable and\r\nresulting in moral excellence. In 1709 appeared her last pamphlet,\r\n_Bart'lemy Fair, or an Enquiry after Wit_, an attack on Shaftesbury's\r\n_Letter Concerning Enthusiasm_, which she, however, wrongly\r\nattributed to Swift. The Preface to _Bart'lemy Fair_ is a bitter\r\ninvective against the Kit-Kat Club.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlets thus briefly listed are sufficient to show with\r\nwhat sustained energy Mary Astell entered into the discussions\r\nmost vital in her day. Education, religion, politics, and social\r\nquestions held her entire attention. She was never side-tracked\r\ninto anything light or gay. We find no indications that she had\r\nany interest in art or general literature, that she had any of the\r\nrecognized accomplishments, that she put any stress on scientific or\r\nlinguistic attainments. She was temperamentally a controversialist,\r\na propagandist. She was too serious, too much in earnest, to play\r\nwith a subject. Her disapprovals were never softened by any humorous\r\nrecognition of human foibles. For the graces and amenities of style\r\nshe had slight regard. But she was beyond any woman and most men\r\nof her day in her command of the weapons of satire and irony. She\r\ncould pierce to the heart of a sham or a sophistry, and she was\r\nmerciless in her analysis of a trifling, corrupt, or irreligious\r\nlife. She stands as a new type of learned woman. No other woman had\r\nideas so rigorously thought-out or so firmly expressed. She taught\r\nwith authority, not with the timidity, self-distrust, or reticence\r\nsupposedly feminine in her time. She did not, write for money or for\r\nfame. She wrote because she had a message.\r\n\r\nMany of the actual causes championed by Mary Astell are now dead\r\nissues, but her ideas concerning women, their education, their\r\nincreased freedom of action, even in some measure their economic\r\nindependence, led her into a field of controversy the problems of\r\nwhich are even yet but imperfectly solved. In the cause of feminism\r\nshe did pioneer work quite amazing in its challenge of contemporary\r\nopinion and in its tempered wisdom. Her fundamental assumption was\r\nthat the potentialities of women must be considered undetermined\r\nuntil they have been given full opportunities for preparation, and\r\ntested by real tasks. \"Women are from their very Infancy,\" she says,\r\n\"debarr'd those advantages with the want of which they are afterwards\r\nreproached, and nursed up in those vices which will hereafter be\r\nupbraided to them. So partial are Men to Expect Bricks when they\r\nafford no Straw.\"\r\n\r\nEleven years later in the Preface to _Reflections on Marriage_, in\r\nthe edition of 1706, she wrote with greater bitterness:\r\n\r\n  In the first place, Boys have much Time and Pains, Care and Cost\r\n  bestowed on their education, Girls have little or none. The\r\n  former are early initiated in the Sciences, are made acquainted\r\n  with Antient and Modern Discoveries, they Study Books and\r\n  Men, have all imaginable encouragement; not only Fame, a dry\r\n  reward now-a-days, But also Title, Authority, Power, and Riches\r\n  themselves which purchase all things, are the reward of their\r\n  improvement. The latter are restricted, frown'd upon, beat,\r\n  not _for_ but _from_ the Muses; Laughter and Ridicule that\r\n  never-failing Scare-Crow is set up to drive them from the Tree of\r\n  Knowledge. But if in spite of all difficulties Nature prevails,\r\n  and they can't be kept so ignorant as their masters would have\r\n  them, they are stared upon as Monsters, Censur'd, Envyd and every\r\n  way discouraged, or at the best they have the Fate the Proverb\r\n  assigns them: _Virtue is praised and starved_.\r\n\r\nEven more caustic is her outburst against the women who accept the\r\ntheory of their inferiority and hug their chains:\r\n\r\n  She's a Fool who would attempt their Deliverance or Improvements.\r\n  No, let them enjoy the great Honour and Felicity of their tame,\r\n  submissive and depending Temper! Let the Men applaud, and let\r\n  them glory in this wonderful Humility! Let them receive the\r\n  Flatteries and Grimaces of the other Sex, live unenvied by their\r\n  own, and be as much belov'd as one such Woman can afford to love\r\n  another! Let them enjoy the Glory of treading in the Footsteps\r\n  of their Predecessors, and of having the Prudence to avoid that\r\n  audacious attempt of soaring beyond their Sphere! Let them\r\n  Houswife or Play, Dress and be pretty entertaining Company! Or,\r\n  which is better, relieve the Poor to ease their own Compassions,\r\n  read pious Books, say their Prayers, and go to Church, because\r\n  they have been taught and us'd to do so, without being able to\r\n  give a better Reason for their Faith and Practice! Let them not\r\n  by any means aspire to being Women of Understanding, because\r\n  no Man can endure a Woman of Superior Sense, or would treat a\r\n  reasonable Woman civilly, but that he thinks he stands on higher\r\n  Ground, and that she is so wise as to make Exceptions, in his\r\n  Favour, and to take her Measures by his Directions; they may\r\n  pretend to Sense, indeed, since meer Pretences only render one\r\n  the more ridiculous! Let them, in short, be what is call'd\r\n  _very_ Women, for this is most acceptable to all sorts of Men;\r\n  or let them aim at the Title of _good devout_ Women, since Men\r\n  can bear with this; but let them not judge of the Sex by their\r\n  own Scantling: For the great Author of Nature and Fountain of all\r\n  Perfection, never design'd that the Mean and Imperfect, but that\r\n  the most Compleat and Excellent of his Creatures in every Kind,\r\n  should be the Standard to the rest.[409]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these very real elements of discouragement Mary Astell\r\nproposed a remedy. The basic assumptions of her _Serious Proposal_ in\r\n1694 are nearly identical with those of Bathsua Makin's _Prospectus_,\r\ntwenty-one years earlier. They agree that girls have minds worth\r\ntraining, that education is their natural right, their most reliable\r\nsafeguard, and a permanent source of strength and happiness. But here\r\nthe likeness ends. Mrs. Makin's inchoate plans contemplated little\r\nmore than the ordinary school for housewifery and accomplishments,\r\nwith the addition of solid learning for those who could be lured into\r\nit. The total training did not extend beyond the years a girl would\r\nordinarily spend in a boarding-school, hence the genuine learning she\r\ncould gain would be almost negligible. Mary Astell's plan was much\r\nmore comprehensive. It was for women as well as for girls. To her\r\n\"Religious Retirement\" might go women tired of the world, young women\r\nwaiting the arrangement of a suitable marriage, heiresses desiring to\r\nescape pursuit, spinsters anxious for some honorable retreat from a\r\nderisive world. All would find a serene and ordered life. But no vows\r\nwere to be taken. In fact, one important purpose of the college was\r\nto provide England with virtuous and accomplished wives, through whom\r\nsocial regeneration might be brought about.\r\n\r\nIn thus educating wives, however, Mary Astell had no iconoclastic\r\nor alarming notions of female dominance. She is as positive as\r\nthe author of _The Ladies Calling_, or of Halifax himself, in her\r\nconception of the husband as the head of the house. She says:\r\n\r\n  She then who Marries, ought to lay it down for an indisputable\r\n  Maxim, that her Husband must govern absolutely and intirely,\r\n  and that she has nothing else to do but to Please and Obey. She\r\n  must not attempt to divide his Authority, or so much as dispute\r\n  it; to struggle with her Yoke will only make it gall the more,\r\n  but must believe him Wise and Good in all respects the best,\r\n  at least he must be so to her. She who can't do this is no way\r\n  fit to be a Wife, she may set up for that peculiar Coronet the\r\n  antient Fathers talk'd of, but is not qualified to receive the\r\n  great Reward which attends the eminent Exercise of Humility and\r\n  Self-denial, Patience and Resignation, the duties that a Wife is\r\n  call'd to.[410]\r\n\r\nEducation can fortify and guide married women and can give them\r\nunending private satisfaction, but can in no way alter their status\r\nor secure them any freedom.\r\n\r\nTo the unmarried woman the college offered the only means so far\r\ndevised whereby they could not only escape from the odium of a single\r\nlife, but could have a chance for activity along lines chosen in\r\naccordance with their tastes and capacities.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the college and the plans as outlined were so reasonable\r\nand put forward with so much eloquence that they attracted\r\nfavorable attention. Part II of the _Proposal_ was dedicated to the\r\nPrincess Anne, and it is to her that we must give the credit for a\r\nsubscription of £10,000 for the necessary buildings.[411] And it is\r\npractically certain that Bishop Burnet, at this time tutor to the\r\nyoung Duke of Gloucester and so of easy access to Anne, is the one to\r\nwhom we must ascribe the withdrawal of that subscription and along\r\nwith it the royal sanction so essential an element in the success of\r\nthe plan. Bishop Burnet saw in this proposed \"Lay Monastery\" a source\r\nof plots and cabals dangerous to the Church. And Anne was too devout\r\nand narrow-minded a churchwoman to run any such risks. So the plan\r\ncame to no practical realization.\r\n\r\nThough the time was probably not ripe for such a college, it is\r\nsignificant that in the aristocratic circle where Mary Astell moved\r\nthere was apparently considerable favorable discussion of the\r\nproject. In 1697 Thomas Burnet wrote to the Electress Sophia of Mary\r\nAstell as \"a young Ladie of extraordinary piety and knowledge as any\r\nof the age\" and comments on her \"two little books of proposals to\r\nthe Ladies\" as showing \"both her zeal and judgment in thee advyces\r\ngiven to her sex, for the reformation of manners, living, studies,\r\nand conversations of the ladies.\"[412] In the same year Defoe, in his\r\n_Essay on Projects_, referred with praise to Mary Astell, though not\r\nagreeing with her plans in detail. In 1697, also, Evelyn commented\r\nfavorably on Mary Astell: He said that he could not omit some\r\nacknowledgment of the satisfaction he had received from her \"most\r\nsublime\" writings, and he adds concerning her college, \"Besides what\r\nlately she has proposed to the Virtuous of her Sex, to shew by her\r\nown Example, what great Things, and Excellencies it is Capable of,\r\nand which calls to mind the Lady of that _Protestant Monastery_, Mrs.\r\n_Farrer_, not long since at _Geding_ in _Huntington-shire_.\"[413]\r\nGeorge Wheler, in _A Protestant Nunnery_, refers to \"_A Serious\r\nProposal_ written by an ingenious Lady\" and gives it the further\r\ncompliment of adopting some of its ideas.[414] George Hickes, in\r\nhis _Instructions for the Education of a Daughter_ (1708), gives _A\r\nSerious Proposal_ and _The Christian Religion_, by Mary Astell, in\r\nthe list of books which he commends to young women. Robert Nelson, in\r\nan _Address to Persons of Quality_ (1715), also praised the _Proposal\r\nto Ladies_ as made \"by a very Ingenious Gentlewoman, which was then\r\nwell approved by several ladies and others.\"[415]\r\n\r\nThe wits of the time are usually accredited with derisive laughter\r\nat the female college. But the chief attacks were from Swift in\r\n_The Tatler_ in 1709, fifteen years after the _Proposal_, Part I,\r\nand twelve years after the second part. Swift's _Tatler_ articles\r\nfollowed immediately on Mary Astell's _Bart'lemy Fair_, and were\r\nreally not so much an attack on a college for women as an attempt to\r\nanswer Mary Astell's satiric commentary on the Kit-Kat Club, and on\r\nSteele and Swift in particular. It was a sort of _quid pro quo_ in\r\nwhich Swift seized upon the weapons most available. The coarseness\r\nof the description of the college must have been very offensive to\r\nMary Astell as a similar vulgarity of attack in _Three Hours after\r\nMarriage_ must have offended Lady Winchilsea. Swift represents the\r\nprofessors of the college to be Madonella (Mary Astell), Epicene\r\n(Mrs. Manley), and Mrs. Elstob, a union that would probably have been\r\nas irritating to Mrs. Manley as it was to her virtuous co-adjutors in\r\nacademic chairs. The break-up of the college is due to a company of\r\nrakes to whom the ladies collegiate give joyous welcome.\r\n\r\nSteele's attacks on Mary Astell are much milder. He represents her as\r\n\"Mrs. Comma, the great Scholar,\" who defends her desired seclusion\r\nby herself announcing to would-be callers that she is \"not at home.\"\r\nAgain, she is put in as the foreman of a jury in a Court of Honour,\r\nand is described as a \"professed Platonist that had spent much of her\r\ntime in exhorting the sex to set a just value upon their persons, and\r\nto make the men know themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThat the attention attracted by Mary Astell's writings was not all\r\ncontemptuous has been already indicated. Her books were, however,\r\nbut one source of her influence. In her later life not only was she\r\nof sufficient repute to make her home in Chelsea a sort of minor\r\nlearned salon, but she had considerable personal influence among\r\nyounger women of like aspirations. Of three of her friendships with\r\nlearned women we have some knowledge. The most intimate of these\r\nwas with Lady Elizabeth Hastings, twenty-two years her junior. Lady\r\nBetty went to Ledstone to live in about 1705 and was thereafter only\r\noccasionally in London, so they could not have had much continuous\r\npersonal association, but they apparently found themselves in\r\nimmediate accord on vital subjects. Lady Betty and her sisters on the\r\nremote Yorkshire estate almost realized in a small way Mary Astell's\r\nideal of a religious retirement. If the correspondence between them\r\nwere only extant it would be invaluable. Elizabeth Elstob is also\r\ngiven as one of Mary Astell's friends. Miss Elstob was in London\r\nfrom 1709 to 1715 and came to know Miss Astell during this period.\r\nIt was to Miss Elstob that Ballard wrote for information about Miss\r\nAstell when he wished to write her biography, which might seem to\r\nargue a known friendship between the two. But against any theory of\r\nreal intimacy is the fact that Miss Astell, a woman of substance and\r\nwide influence, did not exert herself in Miss Elstob's behalf when\r\nshe was left penniless and driven into obscurity. The most noted\r\nof Mary Astell's literary friends was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.\r\nThe culmination of that friendship in the indignant championship by\r\nMary Astell of Lady Mary's _Turkish Letters_ appears in an essay\r\ndated 1724, but the friendship was of much earlier date. It was not\r\nby wealth or position or beauty or social charm that Mary Astell\r\ngained and held her friends. In person she was \"ill-favoured and\r\nforbidding,\" in manner she was abrupt and even rough in repelling\r\nwhat displeased her. She defended her own leisure and followed her\r\nown plans with defiance of all social conventions. She had the\r\ninstincts of a recluse. She was deeply religious, austere to the\r\npoint of asceticism, and her friendships were no matter of mutual\r\nadmiration and easy compliances. She was a flaming advocate of Lady\r\nMary against all detractors, but she stoutly combated Lady Mary's\r\nreligious indifferentism. It was by sheer force of intellectual\r\nability, moral earnestness, and profound convictions that Mary Astell\r\ngained her general repute and by sincerity and an unexpected ardor of\r\ndevotion that she held her friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Essay in Defence of the Female Sex (1696)]\r\n\r\nMary Astell's _Serious Proposal_ appeared in 1694 with a second\r\nedition in 1695. In 1696 there appeared another feminist pamphlet\r\nthe full title of which was _An Essay in Defence of the Female Sex\r\nin which are inserted the characters of A Pedant, A Squire, A Beau,\r\nA Vertuoso, A Poetaster, A City-critick. C. In a Letter to a Lady\r\nby a Lady._ A second edition in 1696, a third in 1697, a fourth in\r\n1791, and an undated but later edition, testify to its popularity.\r\nThis pamphlet was long attributed to Mary Astell, but both internal\r\nand external evidence are against her authorship. There seem to\r\nbe reasons for ascribing it to Mrs. Drake, the sister of the Mr.\r\nJames Drake who wrote the commendatory poem and essay published\r\nwith the _Defence of the Female Sex_.[416] Whoever the author was\r\nshe certainly deserves the credit of being the most brilliant woman\r\nwriter of her period. In her Preface she says:\r\n\r\n  There have been women in all Ages, whose Writings might vie\r\n  with those of the greatest Men, as the Present Age as well as\r\n  past can testifie.... Their names are already too well known,\r\n  and celebrated to receive any additional Lustre from so weak\r\n  Encomiums as mine.... I pretend not to imitate, much less to\r\n  Rival those Illustrious Ladies who have done so much Honour to\r\n  their Sex, and are unanswerable Proofs of what I contend for.\r\n  I only wish, that some Ladies now living among us (whose names\r\n  I forbear to mention in regard to their Modesty) wou'd exert\r\n  themselves, and give us more recent Instances, who are both by\r\n  Nature and Education sufficiently qualified to do it, which I\r\n  pretend not to.\r\n\r\nThe _Essay_ opens with a statement that women must plead their own\r\ncause, since men no longer enter the lists in their behalf. The most\r\nrecent woman's advocate, William Walsh, she dismisses with scant\r\npraise:\r\n\r\n  Those Romantick days are over, and there is not so much as a _Don\r\n  Quixote_ of the Quill left to succor the distressed Damsels. 'T\r\n  is true a Feint of something of this Nature was made three or\r\n  four years since by one; but how much soever his Eugenia may\r\n  be oblig'd to him, I am of Opinion the rest of her Sex are but\r\n  little beholding to him. For as you rightly observ'd, _Madam_,\r\n  he has taken more care to give an Edge to his Satyr, than force\r\n  to his Apology; he has play'd a sham Prize, and receives more\r\n  thrusts than he makes.... He levels his Scandals at the whole\r\n  Sex, and thinks us sufficiently fortified, if out of the Story\r\n  of Two Thousand Years he has been able to pick up a few Examples\r\n  of Women illustrious for their Wit, Learning or Vertue.... I\r\n  have neither Learning nor Inclination to make a Precedent, or\r\n  indeed any use of Mr. W's labour'd Common Place Book; and shall\r\n  leave Pedents and School-Boys to rake and tumble the Rubbish of\r\n  Antiquity, and muster all the _Heroes_ and _Heroins_ they can\r\n  find.\r\n\r\nThe _Essay_ takes up no such serious and practical topics as Mary\r\nAstell discusses. The curious question proposed is, \"Whether the\r\ntime an ingenious Gentleman spends in the Company of Women, may\r\njustly be said to be misemploy'd, or not.\" The opinion to be combated\r\nis that of men who declare the company of women to be irksome and\r\nunprofitable. The author gives the old argument that in souls there\r\nis no male and female, and brings Scripture proof that woman was\r\nexpressly created as a companion for man. If the divine plan has been\r\ninterfered with by the disqualification of women the cause is to be\r\nfound not in their minds or natures but in their lack of education.\r\nMen should no more exult over being wiser than women than they would\r\ncongratulate themselves on conquering a man whose hands were tied.\r\n\r\nBut women, even without regular education, know more than they are\r\nsupposed to know. At boarding-schools, to be sure, they learn only\r\nneedlework, dancing, singing, music, drawing, painting, and other\r\naccomplishments; and of languages they know only their mother tongue\r\nand French, \"now very fashionable and almost as familiar amongst\r\nWomen of Quality as Men.\" But after school days they have abundant\r\nleisure and the world of classic literature is open to them in\r\ntranslations. Ovid, Tibullus, Juvenal, Horace, Plutarch, Seneca, and\r\nCicero may be read by the woman who knows only her mother tongue,\r\nand Dryden has already given \"Divine Samples\" of the sweetness\r\nand majesty of Virgil. The graces of France and Italy are equally\r\nat woman's command. Following this account of foreign, especially\r\nclassic literature, is an energetic passage, very modern in tone,\r\nattacking the conception dominant in the Augustan age that the term\r\n\"learning\" applied only to a knowledge of the dead languages.\r\n\r\n  Nor can I imagine for what good Reason a Man skill'd in Latin\r\n  and Greek, and vers'd in the Authors of Ancient Times shall be\r\n  call'd Learned; yet another who perfectly understands _Italian_,\r\n  _French_, _High Dutch_, and the rest of the _European_ Languages,\r\n  is acquainted with the Modern History of all those Countries\r\n  ... shall after all this be thought Unlearned for want of those\r\n  two Languages. Nay, though he be never so well vers'd in the\r\n  Modern Philosophy, Astronomy, Geometry, and Algebra, he shall\r\n  notwithstanding never be allow'd that honourable Title....\r\n  Thus you shall have 'em allow a Man to be a wise Man, a good\r\n  Naturalist, a good Mathematician, Politician, or Poet, but not\r\n  a Scholar, a learned Man, that is no Philologer. For my part I\r\n  think these Gentlemen have just inverted the use of the Term, and\r\n  given that to the knowledge of words, which belongs more properly\r\n  to Things. I take Nature to be the great Book of Universal\r\n  Learning, which he that reads best in all, or in any of its\r\n  Parts, is the greatest Scholar, the most learned Man.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, ignorance of Latin is no such drawback when one\r\nconsiders the English language and its riches. Who is nobler than Mr.\r\nShakespeare? Whose grief more awful than Mr. Otway's? What tenderer\r\nPassion than in the _Maid's Tragedy_? Whose thoughts more beautiful\r\nand gallant than Mr. Dryden's? Her \"Indignation, Compassion, Grief,\r\nare all at the Beck of these dramatists.\" Who can rival Sir George\r\nEtheredge, Sir Charles Sedley, for \"neat Raillery and Gallantry\"?\r\nWho has such strong \"Wit and pointed Satyr\" as Mr. Wicherley? Who\r\ncan offer such \"sprightly, gentile, easie Wit\" as Mr. Congreve? For\r\ncritics, who can more justly point out beauties and defects than\r\nMr. Dennis and Mr. Rymer? If for poetry we are inclined, what more\r\nravishing than the fancy of Cowley and the gallantry of Waller? For\r\nelevation of soul and reverence are there not the _Fairy Queen_ and\r\n_Paradise Lost_? Then as for \"satyrists,\" there are Mr. Butler and\r\nMr. Oldham. For morals there are sermons, pious, solid, eloquent. For\r\nessays, Lord Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh, Mr. Osborn, Sir Wm. Temple,\r\nSir George Mackenzie, Sir Roger L'Estrange.\r\n\r\nThe second portion of the _Essay_ answers those who accuse women of\r\ninconstancy, dissimulation, impertinence, and vanity. These, the\r\nauthor maintains, are imperfections of human nature, not especially\r\nof women; and her method of proof is to show typical masculine\r\nexemplifications of these defects. Under vanity are a \"Bully,\" a\r\n\"Scourer,\" a \"Fop Poet,\" a \"Beau,\" a \"Sloven\"; these being men who\r\ndisqualify themselves for agreeable social intercourse by a too\r\nemphatic and egregious desire to bring themselves into notice.\r\n\r\n  Of these the most voluminous Fool is the Fop Poet who ... has\r\n  always more Wit in his Pockets than any where else, yet seldom\r\n  or never any of his own there. _Esop's Daw_ was a _Type_ of him;\r\n  for he makes himself fine with the Plunder of all Parties. He is\r\n  a Smuggler of Wit, and steals French Fancies without paying the\r\n  customary Duties. Verse is his _Manufacture_; For it is more the\r\n  labour of his Finger than his brain.... He talks much of _Jack\r\n  Dryden_ and _Will Wycherley_, and the rest of that Set, and\r\n  protests he can't help having some respect for 'em, because they\r\n  have so much for him, and his Writings.... Once a Month he fits\r\n  out a small _Poetical Smack_ at the charge of his Bookseller,\r\n  which he lades with _French Plunder_ new vampt in English, small\r\n  Ventures of _Translated Odes_, _Elegies_ and _Epigrams_ of Young\r\n  Traders, and ballasts with heavy Prose, of his own.... He is the\r\n  Oracle of those that want Wit and the Plague of those that have\r\n  it.... Men avoid him for the same Reason they avoid the Pillory,\r\n  the security of their Ears.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pedant\" and the \"Country Squire\" are both blockheads, and thus\r\nunfitted for rational society. \"For my part, I think the Learned and\r\nUnlearned Blockhead pretty equal; for 't is all one to me, whether\r\na Man talk Nonsense, or unintelligible Sense.\" These characters are\r\nespecially effective. Not Pope himself has a more trenchant and\r\nsharply antithetic picture of the \"Vertuoso.\" Contemporary public\r\nopinion as to the uselessness of the students of grasses, flies,\r\nbugs, shells, coins, etc., received concise and picturesque statement\r\nin the _Defence_.\r\n\r\n  What improvements of _Physick_, or any useful Arts, what noble\r\n  Remedies, what serviceable Instruments have these Mushrome, and\r\n  Cockel-shell Hunters oblig'd the World with? For I am ready to\r\n  recant if they can shew so good a Med'cine as Stew'd _Prunes_,\r\n  or so necessary an Instrument as a _Flye Flop_ of their own\r\n  Invention and Discovery.... I wou'd not have any Body mistake\r\n  me so far, as to think I wou'd in the least reflect upon any\r\n  sincere, and intelligent Enquirers into Nature, of which I as\r\n  heartily wish a better knowledge, as any _Vertuoso_ of 'em all.\r\n  You can be my Witness, Madam, that I us'd to say, I thought Mr.\r\n  _Boyle_ more honourable for his learned Labours, than for his\r\n  Noble Birth; and that the _Royal Society_, by their great and\r\n  celebrated Performances, were an Illustrious Argument of the\r\n  Wisdom of the August Prince, their Founder of Happy _Memory_; and\r\n  that they highly merited the _Esteem_, _Respect_ and _Honour_\r\n  paid 'em by the Lovers of Learning all _Europe_ over. But though\r\n  I have a very great Veneration for the _Society_ in general, I\r\n  can't but put a vast difference between the particular Members\r\n  that compose it.\r\n\r\nThe character of a \"Beau\" is keen and minute in observation. No\r\ncoquette was more admirably dissected. The later _Tatler_ pictures\r\nare inferior in brightness and pointed detail. The whole account\r\nis readable, laughable. Impertinence is defined as the quality of\r\nbusying one's self with the trivial, and forcing these petty affairs\r\non the attention of the uninterested. The author responds in lively\r\nfashion to those who count this a peculiarly feminine trait:\r\n\r\n  Thus, when they hear us talking to, and advising one another\r\n  about the Order, Distribution, and Contrivance of _Household\r\n  Affairs_, about the _Regulation_ of the _Family_, the\r\n  _Government_ of _Children_ and _Servants_, the provident\r\n  management of a Kitchin, and the decent ordering of a _Table_,\r\n  the suitable _Matching_ and convenient disposition of\r\n  _Furniture_, and the like, they condemn us for impertinence.\r\n  Yet they may be pleased to consider, that as the affairs of\r\n  the World are now divided betwixt us, the _Domestick_ are our\r\n  share, and out of which we are rarely suffer'd to interpose our\r\n  Sense. They may be pleased to consider likewise, that as light\r\n  and inconsiderable as these things seem, they are capable of no\r\n  Pleasures of Sense higher, or more refin'd than those of _Brutes_\r\n  without our care of 'em. For were it not for that, their Houses\r\n  wou'd be meer _Bedlums_, their most luxurious Treats, but a rude\r\n  confusion of ill Digested, ill mixt Scents and Relishes, and the\r\n  fine Furniture, they bestow so much cost on, but an expensive\r\n  Heap of glittering Rubbish. Thus they are beholding to us for the\r\n  comfortable enjoyment of what their labour, or good Fortune hath\r\n  acquir'd or bestow'd, and think meanly of our care only, because\r\n  they understand not the value of it.\r\n\r\nThe _Essay_ is, in reality, hardly more than a frame for the\r\n\"Characters.\" It defends the female sex, by the method of denouncing\r\nthe \"Adversaries of the Sex.\" Its result as argument is, therefore,\r\non the whole, negative. But the positive value of the book is\r\ngreat in its spirited exemplification of a woman's power to form\r\nindependent judgments and to write vigorous English.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daniel Defoe (1661-1731)]\r\n\r\nIn 1697, the year in which the fourth edition of Mary Astell's _A\r\nSerious Proposal to the Ladies_ appeared, Defoe published his _Essay\r\non Projects_. Among plans for joint-stock banks, repairing and\r\nwidening of highways, assurance societies, sick clubs, pensions for\r\nwidows, etc., comes \"An Academy for Women\":\r\n\r\n  I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs\r\n  in the world, considering us as a civilized and a Christian\r\n  country, that we deny the advantages of learning to our women.\r\n  We reproach the sex every day with folly and impertinence, while\r\n  I am confident, had they the advantages of education equal to\r\n  us, they would be guilty of less than ourselves. One would\r\n  wonder indeed how it should happen that women are conversible\r\n  at all, since they are only beholden to natural parts for all\r\n  their knowledge. Their youth is spent to teach them to stitch\r\n  and sew, or make baubles; they are taught to read, indeed, and\r\n  perhaps to write their names, or so, and that is the height of\r\n  a woman's education; and I would but ask those who slight the\r\n  sex for their understanding, what is a man (a gentleman I mean)\r\n  good for, that is taught no more?... The soul is placed in the\r\n  body like a rough diamond, and must be polished, or the lustre of\r\n  it will never appear; and 't is manifest that, as the rational\r\n  soul distinguishes us from brutes, so education carries on the\r\n  distinction, and makes some less brutish than others. This is\r\n  too evident to need any demonstration. But why, then, should\r\n  women be denied the benefit of instruction?... I would ask any\r\n  such, what they can see in ignorance that they should think it a\r\n  necessary ornament to a woman? Or how much worse is a wise woman\r\n  than a fool? Or what has the woman done to forfeit the privilege\r\n  of being taught?... Shall we upbraid women with folly, when 't\r\n  is only the error of this inhuman custom that hindered them from\r\n  being made wiser?\r\n\r\n  The capacities of women are supposed to be greater, and their\r\n  senses quicker, than those of the men; and what they might\r\n  have been capable of being bred to, is plain from instances of\r\n  female wit, which this age is not without; which upbraids us\r\n  with injustice, and looks as if we denied women the advantage\r\n  of education for fear they should vie with the men in their\r\n  improvements. To remove this objection, and that women might\r\n  have at least a needful opportunity of education in all sorts of\r\n  useful learning, I propose the draught of an academy for that\r\n  purpose.... I doubt a method proposed by an ingenious lady, in\r\n  a little book called _Advice to the Ladies_, would be found\r\n  impracticable.... When I talk, therefore, of an academy for\r\n  women, I mean both the model, the teaching, and the government\r\n  different from what is proposed by that ingenious lady for whose\r\n  proposal I have a very great esteem, and also a great opinion of\r\n  her wit; different, too, from all sorts of religious confinement,\r\n  and, above all, from vows of celibacy.\r\n\r\n  Wherefore the academy I propose should differ but little from\r\n  public schools, wherein such ladies as were willing to study,\r\n  should have all the advantages of learning suitable to their\r\n  genius....\r\n\r\n  The building should be of three plain fronts, without any\r\n  jettings or bearing work, that the eye might at a glance see from\r\n  one coin to the other; the gardens walled in the same triangular\r\n  figure, with a large moat, and but one entrance.\r\n\r\nHaving thus provided against intrigues and escapades he would have no\r\nguards, no eyes, no spies, set over the ladies, but would expect them\r\nto be tried by the principles of honor and strict virtue.\r\n\r\nDefoe's arguments in favor of the higher education of women represent\r\nthe most advanced thought of his age.\r\n\r\n  Methinks mankind, for their own sakes, since, say what we will\r\n  of the women, we all think fit one time or other to be concerned\r\n  with them, should take some care to breed them up to be suitable\r\n  and serviceable, if they expected no such thing as delight from\r\n  them. Bless us! what care do we take to breed up a good horse,\r\n  and to break him well! And why not a woman?...\r\n\r\n  But to come closer to the business. The great distinguishing\r\n  difference which is seen in the world between men and women, is\r\n  in their education; and this is manifested by comparing it with\r\n  the difference between one man or woman and another.\r\n\r\n  And herein is it I take upon me to make such a bold assertion,\r\n  that all the world are mistaken in their practice about women;\r\n  for I can not think that God Almighty ever made them so delicate,\r\n  so glorious creatures, and furnished them with such charms, so\r\n  agreeable and delightful to man, with souls capable of the same\r\n  accomplishments with men, and all only to be stewards of our\r\n  houses, cooks, and slaves.\r\n\r\n  Not that I am for exalting the female government in the least;\r\n  but, in short, I would have men take women for companions, and\r\n  educate them to be fit for it....\r\n\r\n  I need not enlarge on the loss the defect of education is to\r\n  the sex, nor argue the benefit of the contrary practice: it is\r\n  a thing will be more easily granted than remedied. This chapter\r\n  is but an essay at the thing; and I refer the practice to these\r\n  happy days, if ever they shall be, when men shall be wise enough\r\n  to mend it.\r\n\r\nDefoe asserts that his ideas on this subject were not derived from\r\nMary Astell, and is even slightly irritated that she was ahead of\r\nhim in publication, since he had long before mentally elaborated the\r\nscheme he suggests.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Sophia Pamphlets\" (1739-40)]\r\n\r\nThe feminist argument was carried on in what are known as the \"Sophia\r\nPamphlets.\" The first of these appeared in 1739 and was entitled\r\n_Woman not inferior to Man: or a short and modest vindication of the\r\nnatural right of the fair sex to a perfect equality of power, dignity\r\nand esteem with the men. By Sophia a person of Quality._ There was an\r\nimmediate answer under the title, _Man superior to Woman; containing\r\na plain confutation of the fallacious arguments of Sophia in her\r\nlate Treatise intitled Woman not Inferior to Man_. In 1740 Sophia\r\nresponded with, _Woman's superior excellence over Man or a reply to\r\nthe author of a late treatise entitled Man superior to Woman. In\r\nwhich the excessive weakness of that Gentleman's answer to Woman\r\nnot inferior to Man is exposed._ The three pamphlets were published\r\ntogether in 1757 under the collective title _Beauty's Triumph_.\r\nThese pamphlets give an interesting little passage at arms in the\r\nfeminist controversy. The subjects taken up in the first pamphlet are\r\nclosely modeled on _The Woman as Good as the Man_. \"In what esteem\r\nthe women are held by the men and how justly\"; \"Whether women are\r\ninferior to men in this intellectual capacity, or not\"; \"Whether the\r\nmen are better qualified to govern than women, or not\"; \"Whether the\r\nwomen are fit for public offices, or not\"; \"Whether the women are\r\nnaturally capable of teaching sciences, or not\"; \"Whether women are\r\nnaturally qualified for military offices, or not,\"--these are the\r\ntopics discussed. With regard to the education of women Sophia says:\r\n\r\n  Men, by thinking us incapable of improving our intellects, have\r\n  entirely thrown us out of the advantages of education, and\r\n  thereby contributed as much as possible to make us the senseless\r\n  creatures they imagine us. So that for want of education, we are\r\n  rendered subject to all the follies they dislike in us.... And\r\n  as our sex, when it applies to learning, may be said at least to\r\n  keep pace with the men, so are they more to be esteemed for their\r\n  learning than the latter: Since they are under a necessity of\r\n  surmounting the softness they were educated in; of renouncing the\r\n  pleasure and indolence to which cruel custom seem'd to condemn\r\n  them to overcome the external impediments in their way of study;\r\n  and to conquer the disadvantageous notions, which the vulgar of\r\n  both sexes entertain of learning in women. And whether it be\r\n  these difficulties add any keenness to a female understanding, or\r\n  that nature has given women, a quicker more penetrating genius\r\n  than to men, it is self-evident that many of our sex have far\r\n  out-stript the men. Why then are we not as fit to learn and teach\r\n  the sciences, at least to our own sex, as they fancy themselves\r\n  to be.... We may easily conclude then, that if our sex, as it\r\n  hitherto appears, have all the talents requisite to learn and\r\n  teach these sciences, which qualify men for power and dignity,\r\n  they are equally capable of applying their knowledge to practice\r\n  in exercising that power and dignity. And since, as we have said,\r\n  this nation has seen many glorious instances of Women, severally\r\n  qualified to have all public authority center'd in them, why may\r\n  they not be as qualified at least for the subordinate offices of\r\n  ministers of state, vice-queens, governesses, etc.?\r\n\r\nSophia has, however, one reservation. Women may not enter the\r\nministry:\r\n\r\n  Thus far I insist there is no _science_ or _public office_ in a\r\n  state which women are not as much qualified for by Nature as the\r\n  ablest of Men. With regard to divinity, our natural capacity has\r\n  been restrain'd by a positive law of God: and therefore we know\r\n  better than to lay claim to what we could not practice without\r\n  sacrilegious intrusion.\r\n\r\nThe Gentleman, in his answer to Sophia, takes up her claims\r\n_seriatim_ and disposes of them to his own satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  Neither Juvenal nor I [he says] deny that Women may acquire some\r\n  superficial Learning. All we contend for is that it is ever evil\r\n  bestowed upon them, inasmuch as it renders them useless to their\r\n  own sex, and a nuisance to ours.... I grant Greece has shewn its\r\n  Sappho, Rome her Cornelia, France has produced a Dacier; Holland\r\n  has brought forth a Schurman; Italy a Doctress; and England now\r\n  boasts an Eliza and a Sophia.\r\n\r\nBut the whole serio-comic tone of the Gentleman's _Essay_ makes it\r\ndifficult of interpretation. Sophia writes as if she were in genuine\r\nearnest in her protest and propaganda. But it seems much less certain\r\nthat the Gentleman is not merely playing with the situation.[417] The\r\nidentity of the writers has not been discovered. Miss McIlquham[418]\r\nbelieves Lady Mary Wortley Montagu to be Sophia. But this is hardly\r\nlikely, since 1739 is the year Lady Mary went to Italy. A writer\r\nsigning himself \"Medley,\" in _Notes and Queries_, suggests that\r\n\"Sophia\" was Lady Sophia Fermor, the second wife of Lord Cararet,\r\nand thinks she may also have been the \"Sophia\" of _Letters of Portia\r\nto her Daughter Sophia_, though these were not published till years\r\nlater.[419]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS BOOKS ON WOMEN IN SOCIAL AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to definite discussions as to the learning appropriate\r\nfor women, there were numerous books on general topics pertaining to\r\nwomen, with incidental but often most illuminating comments on the\r\nadvantages or disadvantages of a liberal education. These books also\r\naid in building up a conception of the prevailing ideas concerning\r\nwomen apart from technical questions of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ladies' Calling (1673, 2d ed.)]\r\n\r\n_The Ladies' Calling_, the second edition of which appeared in 1673,\r\nwas the most important as well as the most influential of all the\r\nseventeenth-century books on the social and domestic aspects of\r\nthe life of women. The book is eminently well-bred, dignified, and\r\naristocratic in tone, and ardently religious. The authorship of _The\r\nLadies' Calling_ has long been in dispute. Tradition has persistently\r\nascribed it to Lady Pakington who, said Lady Winchilsea,\r\n\r\n      Of each Sex the two best Gifts enjoy'd,\r\n      The Skill to write, the Modesty to hide.\r\n\r\nBut if she were the author she has hidden the fact so successfully\r\nas to lose the credit of her work. Modern investigation ascribes the\r\nseries of books, _The Whole Duty of Man_, _The Gentleman's Calling_,\r\nand _The Ladies' Calling_, with some degree of certainty to Richard\r\nAllestree,[420] one of the learned and devout men who found in Lady\r\nPakington intellectual as well as religious sympathy. But it seems\r\nquite probable that Lady Pakington assisted him in _The Ladies'\r\nCalling_. At any rate, whoever the author, the book may fairly be\r\nconsidered an expression of the ideals of the group surrounding Lady\r\nPakington, an outgrowth of their discussions. The \"Calling\" described\r\nis purely religious in tone, and the republication of the book in\r\n1673 gains an added significance when we think of it as a protest\r\nagainst the social customs of the Restoration court and an appeal\r\nto ladies of high rank, summoning them to a sober sense of their\r\nduties and responsibilities. In an exaltation of Meekness, Modesty,\r\nAffability, and Piety as the genuine and proper Ornaments of Women,\r\nthe author states the opposing faults as he has observed them. The\r\npicture he gives of ladies in the best circles is sufficiently\r\nappalling. Under \"Modesty\" is a protest against \"Female swearers.\"\r\n\"An Oath sounds gratingly out of whatever mouth, but out of a woman's\r\nit hath such an uncooth harshness that there is no noise this side\r\nof Hell can be more amazingly odious.\" Drinking is also reprobated\r\nas \"a vice detestable in all, but prodigious in women,\" \"nothing\r\nhuman being so much a beast as a drunken woman.\" Modesty also forbids\r\nexcessive talkativeness, \"that indecency of loquacity\" generally\r\ncharged to women. It forbids loudness of discourse, \"a blustering or\r\nranting style,\" or even \"unhandsome earnestness.\" All mannishness\r\nin speech, manner, or dress must be avoided. Public speaking, even\r\non the part of gifted women, is alien alike to St. Paul and true\r\nmodesty. \"Incontinence of mind,\" whereby secrets slip so easily\r\nfrom the female grasp, is likewise opposed to the sobriety and\r\nself-restraint implied in modesty.\r\n\r\nAttractive and important as modesty is, it is outranked in value as a\r\ndaily necessity by Meekness, meekness of the will, of the affections,\r\nof the understanding. Women particularly need this endearing quality\r\nof ready submission to authority, for, \"since God has thus determined\r\nsubjection to be the women's lot, there needs no other argument of\r\nits fitness, or for their acquiescence\"; and since they must always\r\nbe under the control of parents or husband, they will do well to\r\ncultivate meekness, \"the parent of peace.\"\r\n\r\nAffability and compassion are considered natural to women. They also\r\nhave a predisposition to Piety, for it is based on Fear and Love,\r\nthe \"two most pungent passions of the female sex,\" and is, besides,\r\ntheir greatest ornament. Devotion, since it \"requires a supple gentle\r\nsoil,\" finds feminine softness and pliability very apt and proper for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe second part of _The Ladies' Calling_ comes from generals to\r\nparticulars. It takes up women as Virgins, Wives, and Widows.\r\nModesty and obedience being the recognized virtues of Virgins, their\r\ncase is passed over as having been already adequately presented.\r\n\"Superannuated Virgins\" are less easy to dispose of. \"An old Maid\r\nis now thought such a Curse as no Poetic fury can exceed, look'd on\r\nas the most calamitous Creature in Nature.\" There was no possible\r\ncomplete evasion of the contempt with which protracted maidenhood\r\nwas regarded. If, however, \"these superannuated Virgins would behave\r\nthemselves with Gravity and Reservedness, addict themselves to the\r\nstrictest Virtu and Piety, they would give the world some cause to\r\nbelieve 't was not their necessity, but their choice, that kept them\r\nunmarried; that they were pre-engaged to a better Amour, espoused to\r\nthe Spiritual Bridegroom: and this would give them among the soberer\r\nsort, at least the reverence and esteem of Matrons.... But if, on the\r\nother side, they endeavor to disguise their Age by all the impostures\r\nand gayeties of a youthful dress and behavior, if they still herd\r\nthemselves amongst the youngest and vainest company, and betray a\r\nyoung Mind in an aged Body, this must certainly expose themselves to\r\nscorn and censure.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the heading \"Antiquated Widows\" are similar admonitions to\r\na life of \"assiduous Devotion.\" \"How preposterous is it for an\r\nOld Woman to delight in Gauds and Trifles such as were fitter to\r\nentertain her Grand-children: to read Romances with spectacles, and\r\nbe at Masks and Dancings, when she is fit only to act the Antics?\r\nThese are contradictions to Nature, the tearing off her Marks, and\r\nwhere she has writ fifty or sixty, to lessen ... and write sixteen.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a long, serious, and very sincere book, and its evident\r\npurpose is to take up all important questions concerning women. But\r\nin point of fact, decorum, morality, piety, are the only subjects\r\nof discussion. Education is not mentioned except in the Preface,\r\nwhere it is stated that the mental inferiority of women should not\r\nbe accepted as a foregone conclusion until they have had the same\r\nopportunities as men.\r\n\r\n  Men have their parts cultivated and improved by Education,\r\n  refined and subtilized by Learning and Arts, are like an inclosed\r\n  piece of a Common, which by industry and husbandry becomes a\r\n  different thing from the rest, tho the natural turf owned no\r\n  such inequality. And truly had women the same advantage, I dare\r\n  not say but that they would make as good returns of it; som of\r\n  those few that have bin tried, have bin eminent in several parts\r\n  of Learning.... And were we sure they would have balast to their\r\n  sails, have humility enough to poize themselves against the\r\n  vanity of Learning, I see not why they might not more frequently\r\n  be entrusted with it; for if they could be secured against this\r\n  weed, doubtless the soil is rich enough to bear a good crop.\r\n  But not to oppose a received opinion, let it be admitted, that\r\n  in respect of their intellects they are below men; yet sure in\r\n  the sublimest part of humanity, they are their equals; they have\r\n  souls of as divine an Original, as endless a Duration, and as\r\n  capable of infinite Beatitude.\r\n\r\nAside from this one passage the book is thoroughly conventional in\r\nits conception of the domestic, educational, and social duties and\r\nposition of women. There is no hint of revolt, no thought of enlarged\r\nadvantages. Whatever is, is right, so far as the position of women is\r\nconcerned. The one appeal is for high-mindedness, personal religion,\r\nclose adherence to the Church, as a woman's armor of defense. Within\r\nthe realm of the spirit God and her own nature have set her free for\r\nlofty flights and great attainments.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lady's New Year's Gift (1688)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular and entertaining of the many books for the\r\nparticular advantage of the female sex was _The Lady's New Year's\r\nGift: or, Advice to a Daughter_, by George Savile, first Marquess\r\nof Halifax. It was printed from a circulating manuscript without\r\nauthorization in 1688. The fifteenth edition appeared in 1765. There\r\nwas a new edition in 1791. It was translated into Italian and several\r\ntimes into French.[421] There is no word about education in the book.\r\nIt concerns itself entirely with moral, social, and domestic topics.\r\nVanity, Pride, Censure, Religion, are characteristic headings. Under\r\n\"Behaviour\" is a satiric description of the women who refuse to grow\r\nold.\r\n\r\n  I will add one _Advice_ to conclude this head, which is that\r\n  you will let every seven years make some alteration in you\r\n  towards the Graver side, and not be like the _Girls_ of Fifty,\r\n  who resolve to be always Young, whatever Time with his Iron\r\n  Teeth hath determined to the contrary. Unnatural things carry\r\n  a Deformity in them never to be Disguised; the Liveliness of\r\n  youth in a riper Age, looketh like a new patch upon an old Gown;\r\n  so that a Gay Matron, a cheerful old Fool, may be reasonably\r\n  put into the List of the Tamer kind of Monsters. There is a\r\n  certain Creature call'd a Grave Hobby Horse, a kind of a she\r\n  Numps, that pretendeth to be pulled to a play, and must needs\r\n  go to Bartholomew Fair, to look after the young Folks, whom she\r\n  only seemeth to make her care, in reality she taketh them for\r\n  her excuse. Such an old Butterfly is of all Creatures the most\r\n  ridiculous, and the soonest found out.\r\n\r\nThis passage is apparently reminiscent of _The Ladies' Calling_\r\nand but emphasizes the early relegation of the lady to the cap and\r\nthe chimney-corner. There are other similar social dicta but the\r\nstress of the advice is on Husbands, House, Family, Children, the\r\nHusband bulking so large in the foreground as almost to obscure other\r\ninterests. \"How to live with a husband\" is the central topic. The\r\ngeneral laws on which particular maxims are founded are thus stated:\r\n\r\n  You must first lay it down for a Foundation in general, That\r\n  there is _Inequality_ in the _Sexes_, and that for the better\r\n  Oeconomy of the World, the _Men_, who were to be the Lawgivers,\r\n  had the larger share of _Reason_ bestow'd upon them; by which\r\n  means your Sex is the better prepar'd for the _Compliance_ that\r\n  is necessary for the better performance of those _Duties_ which\r\n  seem to be most properly assign'd to it. This looks a little\r\n  uncourtly at the first appearance; but upon Examination it\r\n  will be found that Nature is so far from being unjust to you,\r\n  that she is partial on your side. She hath made you such large\r\n  _Amends_ by other Advantages, for the seeming _Injustice_ of the\r\n  first Distribution, that the Right of Complaining is come over to\r\n  our Sex. You have it in your power not only to free yourselves,\r\n  but to subdue your Masters, and without violence throw both their\r\n  _Natural_ and _Legal Authority_ at your Feet. We are made of\r\n  differing _Tempers_, that our Defects may the better be Mutually\r\n  Supplied: Your _Sex_ wanteth our _Reason_ for your _Conduct_,\r\n  and our _Strength_ for your _Protection_; _Ours_ wanteth your\r\n  _Gentleness_ to soften, and to entertain us. The first part\r\n  of our Life is a good deal subjected to you in the Nursery,\r\n  where you Reign without Competition, and by that means have the\r\n  advantage of giving the first _Impressions_. Afterwards you have\r\n  stronger Influences, which, well manag'd, have more force in your\r\n  behalf, than all our _Privileges_ and _Jurisdictions_ can pretend\r\n  to have against you. You have more strength in your _Looks_, than\r\n  we in our _Laws_, and more power by your _Tears_, than we have by\r\n  our _Arguments_.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties a wife may meet are fully recognized and the best\r\nways of surmounting them are suggested. Is her husband unfaithful?\r\nThe wife's proper task is Discretion, Silence, affected Ignorance.\r\nDoes he drink to excess? Let her reflect that the fault is too\r\ncommon to be fatal to happiness. Is he ill-humored? The wife has but\r\nto mark \"how the Wheels of such a Man's Head are used to move\" and\r\nshe can manage him at her will. Is he sullen? Watch for \"the first\r\nAppearances of Cloudy Weather and be wary till the Fit shall pass.\"\r\nPossibly he may be a \"Close-handed Wretch.\" This calls forth all\r\na Wife's powers. She must use kindness, play on his ambition and\r\nvanity, using now and then even \"a Dose of Wine to open up a narrow\r\nMind.\" A weak and incompetent husband may become, in the hands of \"a\r\ndexterous woman,\" even an asset of some value. She must, of course,\r\npay deference to him in public, but she can easily see to it that\r\nhe is really under her control. \"Such a Fool is a dangerous Beast,\r\nif others have the keeping of him; and you must be very undexterous\r\nif when your Husband shall resolve to be an _Ass_, you do not take\r\ncare he may be _your Ass_.\" Marriage is but a prolonged fencing-bout\r\nof wits. The woman works under unavoidable handicaps, but if she\r\nis sufficiently adroit, if she is mistress of artifice, if she\r\nknows the tricks of the game, she may emerge from the conflict\r\nsubstantially victorious.\r\n\r\nThe book was written in all seriousness and with tender love for the\r\ndaughter Elizabeth for whose guidance it was intended. She is said\r\nto have prized it highly and to have kept it always on her table.\r\nElizabeth was married early to the third Earl of Chesterfield who\r\nevidently had a humorous appreciation of the book, for he wrote on\r\nthe fly-leaf \"Labour in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Dialogue concerning Women (1691)]\r\n\r\nIn 1691 there appeared _A Dialogue concerning Women, Being a Defence\r\nof the Sex. Written to Eugenia by W. Walsh._ The Preface by John\r\nDryden says of women: \"For my own part, who have always been their\r\nServant, and have never drawn my Pen against them, I had rather see\r\nsome of them prais'd extraordinarily, than any of them suffer by\r\ndetraction: And that in this Age, and at this time particularly,\r\nwherein I find more Heroines than Heroes.\"\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is between Misogynes and Philogynes: Misogynes brings up\r\nSolomon, Euripides, Simonides, Lucian, St. Chrysostom, and Juvenal,\r\nthe Epigrammatists, Comick Poets, and Satyrists, as a dreadful\r\narray of the ancients against women, showing at least that these\r\nancients \"had a very commendable faculty of calling Names.\" Misogynes\r\nespecially dislikes \"the Learned Woman, who runs mad for the love\r\nof hard words, who talks a mixt Jargon, or _Lingua Franca_, and has\r\nspent a great deal of time to make her capable of talking Nonsense in\r\nfour or five different languages.\"[422]\r\n\r\n  Do you not think Learning and Politics become a Woman as ill as\r\n  riding astride? [he asks]. Do you not, in answer to these, fetch\r\n  me a _Sappho_ out of Greece; a _Cornelia_, the Mother of the\r\n  _Gracchi_, out of Rome; an _Anna Maria Schurman_ out of Holland;\r\n  and think that in shewing me three Learned Women in three\r\n  thousand years, you have gain'd your point?\r\n\r\nPhilogynes answers that he shall continue in his opinion that\r\nlearning is suitable for women\r\n\r\n  'till you have answer'd _Anna Maria Shurman's_ Arguments in\r\n  their behalf, and 'till you have taken away her self, who is one\r\n  of the best Arguments.[423] 'T is possible everybody does not\r\n  know, that she was very well skill'd in the _Hebrew, Chaldee,\r\n  Syriac, Arabick, Turkish, Greek, Latin, French, English, Italian,\r\n  Spanish, German, Dutch, and Flemish_ Languages; that she had a\r\n  very good faculty at Poetry and Painting, that she was a perfect\r\n  Mistress of all the Philosophies, that the greatest Divines of\r\n  her time were proud of her judgment in their own profession, and\r\n  that when we had this character of her she was not above Thirty\r\n  years of Age.[424]\r\n\r\n  Or shall I refer you to Mademoiselle _Gournay_ among the\r\n  _French_, or _Lucretia Marinella_ among the _Italians_, who have\r\n  both writ in defence of their Sex, and who are both Arguments\r\n  themselves of the Excellency of it?[425]\r\n\r\n  Consider what Time and Charge is spent to make Men fit for\r\n  somewhat; Eight or Nine Years at School; Six or Seven Years at\r\n  the University; Four or Five Years in Travel; and after all this,\r\n  are they not almost all Fops, Clowns, Dunces, or Pedants? I know\r\n  not what you think of the Women; but if they are Fools they are\r\n  Fools with less pains, and less expence than we are.[426]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gildon's Letters (1694)]\r\n\r\nCharles L. Gildon published in 1694 a volume of miscellaneous letters\r\nand essays. Two of these letters were entitled \"Chloe to Urania,\r\nagainst Womens being Learn'd,\" and \"An Answer to the foregoing\r\nLetter in Defence of Womens being Learn'd.\" Chloe but transmits the\r\narguments of her lover Lysander. \"Learning will add fresh Pride to\r\nthe Sex,\" he asserts, and will kindle in them an ambition of absolute\r\nMastery. His second objection is the fundamental one. \"Women were by\r\ntheir Creator design'd for OBEDIENCE not RULE; to be instructed by\r\ntheir Husbands, not to instruct them; and to Study nothing but their\r\nHousehold Affairs.\" If learning were added to the personal charms of\r\nwomen, not deity itself, Lysander thinks, could maintain the divinely\r\nordained overlordship of man. A final argument is that learning\r\nwill tend to make women unfaithful to their husbands, will give them\r\n\"wandering desires.\" Lysander's antidote for the new ideas that seem\r\nto be perverting women's minds is Halifax's _Advice to a Daughter_,\r\nthe authority of which was so well established that Chloe dares utter\r\nno protest against it. Urania, however, easily demolishes Lysander's\r\nobjections, asserting that learning makes women humble, that no wise\r\nwoman would ever think so wildly as to \"attempt the inverting so\r\nprevalent, and inveterate a Custom of the Sovereignty of the Men.\"\r\nThe _Advice to a Daughter_ is a book Urania has little esteem for.\r\nEspecially is she indignant at Halifax's advice to women to remain in\r\nthe religious faith in which they have been brought up, since, even\r\nif such faith be error, says Halifax, women are not expected to do\r\nthe voluminous reading necessary to find out the truth. Women, Urania\r\nmaintains, should not govern their actions merely by what a corrupt\r\nage \"expects.\" They have souls to save and must learn the truth and\r\nmust have the learning that will guide them to the truth.\r\n\r\nBoth Lysander and Urania make the curious assumption that learning\r\nwould render women more attractive. Lysander thinks it would add\r\nunduly to their power. Urania explains the tendency of the learned\r\nwoman to conjugal infidelity by the statement that her uncommon\r\nlearning results in an uncommon number of admirers. Let more ladies\r\nhave learning and the charm of novelty would vanish.\r\n\r\nUrania is so easily superior to Chloe and her lover that we must\r\nrecognize in Gildon one of the champions of female learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ladies' Dictionary (1694)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious books of the late seventeenth century is _The\r\nLadies' Dictionary; Being a General Entertainment for the Fair-Sex:\r\nA Work Never attempted in English_. It was printed for \"John Dunton\r\nat the Raven in the Poultry, 1694,\" and is signed by \"N. H.\" who lays\r\nclaim to the authorship in the following passage which may be quoted\r\nat length, since from it we also get a characterization of the book,\r\nits proposed scope and aim:\r\n\r\n  _It is now near a Twelve-month since I first entered upon this\r\n  Project, at the desire of a worthy Friend, unto whom I owe more\r\n  than I can do for him: And when I considered the great need of\r\n  such a Book, as might be a_ COMPLEAT DIRECTORY _to the Female Sex\r\n  in all_ Relations, Companies, Conditions and States _of Life;\r\n  even from_ CHILDHOOD _down to_ Old-age, _and from the_ Lady _at\r\n  the Court, to the_ Cook-maid _in the Country: I was at length\r\n  prevailed upon to do it, and the rather because I know not of any\r\n  Book that hath done the like; indeed many learned Writters there\r\n  be, who have wrote excellent well of some_ Particular Subjects\r\n  _herein Treated of, but as there is not one of them hath written\r\n  upon all of them, so there are some things Treated of in this_\r\n  DICTIONARY _that I have not met with in any Language. 'T is\r\n  true_, MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN LOVE AFFAIRS, _might_ have furnisht\r\n  _out Materials for such a Work; yet I do not pretend thereby to\r\n  lessen my Obligations, to those_ Ladies_, who by their Generous\r\n  imparting to me their_ Manuscripts, _have furnisht me with_\r\n  several hundred _Experiments and Secrets in_ DOMESTIC AFFAIRS,\r\n  BEAUTIFYING, PRESERVING, CANDYING, PHYSICK, CHIRURGERY, ETC.\r\n  _Proper for my Work, and such as were not taken out of Printed\r\n  Books, or on the Credit of others, but such as are Re-commended\r\n  to me from their own Practice, all which shall be inserted in\r\n  a_ Second Part, _if this_ FIRST _meets with Encouragement, that\r\n  so both together may contain all_ ACCOMPLISHMENTS _needful for\r\n  Ladies, and be thereby rendered perfect.... So that you'll\r\n  find here at one view, the whole Series and Order of all the\r\n  most Heroick and Illustrious Women of all times, from the\r\n  first dawning of the World to this present Age, of all Regions\r\n  and Climate_, from _the Spicy East, to the Golden West, of_\r\n  all _faiths, whether_ Jews, Ethnicks, _or_ Christians, (_and\r\n  particularly an Account of those_ WOMEN MARTYRS _that suffer'd\r\n  in Queen Mary's days: And in the West in 85: And of all_ Eminent\r\n  _Ladies, that have dy'd in_ England _for these last fifty years_)\r\n  _of all Arts and Sciences, both the graver, and more polite; of\r\n  all Estates_, VIRGINS, WIVES and WIDOWS; _of all Complexions and\r\n  Humours, the Fair, the Foul, the Grave, the Witty, the Reserv'd,\r\n  the Familiar, the Chast, the Wanton. Whatever Poets have fancied,\r\n  or credible Histories have Recorded, of the first you have the\r\n  Misteries and Allegories clearly interpreted and explained; of\r\n  the latter the Genuine Relations Impartially delivered_.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the book is alphabetical, but Mr. \"N. H.\"\r\nis too temperamental to yield entirely to an arbitrary alphabet, and\r\nso, if words are spiritually akin, he does not hesitate to group them\r\nin defiance of their initial letters, as when he puts \"Pimp\" under\r\n\"Bawd,\" being unwilling to separate the household of Satan. There is,\r\nalso, to add to the confusion, unnatural division of subjects. Under\r\n\"D,\" \"Diversions for Ladies\" begins, but it is continued under \"R\" as\r\n\"Recreations for Ladies.\" More than one third of the 522 pages of the\r\nbook is given to such topics as \"Beauty,\" \"How to preserve Beauty,\"\r\n\"Gracefulness,\" \"Behaviour,\" \"Manners,\" \"Love,\" \"Melancholy Lovers,\"\r\n\"Occasions of falling in Love,\" \"Passionate Lovers,\" \"Opinions of\r\nthe Learned on Love,\" \"Progress of Love,\" \"Kissing,\" \"Wooing,\"\r\n\"Courtship,\" and \"Wedding.\"\r\n\r\nMr. \"N. H.\" says he has consulted the most valuable books written for\r\nand against the \"Fair-Sex\" and has made free use of \"Dr. Blancards,\r\nMr. Blounts, and other Dictionaries.\" That he had read _The Ladies\r\nCalling_ and _Advice to a Daughter_ is apparent from his treatment of\r\nsuch topics as, \"HUSBAND INDIFFERENT, or, how to make your Life easie\r\nwith him,\" and \"VIRGINS, THEIR STATE AND BEHAVIOUR, _particularly\r\nthose in years_,\" where the outline of the thought and, in frequent\r\ninstances, the exact phrasing of these recognized authorities are\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n\"Religion, a lady's chief ornament,\" is disposed of in two pages.\r\nLearning takes about four pages. The promise of the author to give a\r\ncatalogue of heroic and illustrious women is fulfilled by hundreds of\r\nnames from myth and legend, from Roman, Greek, and Hebrew history,\r\nand from Italy and Holland. When he begins his search for the eminent\r\nladies in England during the last half-century he summons quite a\r\nlist, including the Countess of Pembroke, Lady Mary Wroth, Ann Askew,\r\nthe daughters of Sir Anthony Cook, Lady Elizabeth Carew, Elizabetha\r\nJoanna Westonia, Lady Jane Grey, the Duchess of Newcastle, Mrs.\r\nKatherine Philips, Anne Broadstreet, and \"Astera Behen,\" but a page\r\nand a half is all he can find to say of all of them together. Mrs.\r\nBehn he describes as \"a Dramatic Poetress, whose well-known Plays\r\nhave been very taking; she was a retained Poetress to one of the\r\nTheatresses, and writ, besides, many curious Poems.\" The Duchess of\r\nNewcastle is \"a very Charitable and obliging Lady to the World\" in\r\nthat she \"copiously imparted to publick View, her Elaborate Works\r\n... not forgetting to make her own and her Lord's Fame live, when\r\nMonuments shall crumble into Dust.\"\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the book is a defense and eulogy of ladies and in\r\nthe very brief portion of it dedicated to learned women it champions\r\ntheir ability and protests against undue limitations of their\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ladies' Diary (1703-1726)]\r\n\r\nAmong the early efforts to meet the tastes of women and at the same\r\ntime coax them along the paths of a more definite mentality, we must\r\nrank _The Ladies' Diary: or, The Woman's Almanack, Containing many\r\nDelightful and Entertaining Particulars, peculiarly adapted for the\r\nUse and Diversion of the Fair-Sex_. One series of these little books\r\nranges continuously from 1703 to 1726. The _Diaries_ were brought out\r\nanonymously, but Mr. Thoresby records in 1720 that he was visited\r\nby \"Mr. Beighton of Coventry, an ingenious gentleman, author of the\r\nLadies' Diary,\" so the authorship seems to have been known though\r\nnot printed.[427] The announced purpose of the _Diaries_ is \"to\r\npromote some Parts of Mathematical Learning amongst the Fair Sex.\"\r\nTo this end Enigmas, Paradoxes, and Arithmetical Questions, are\r\nproposed one year, and prizes given for the answers the next year.\r\nThe Paradoxes included forty-five taken from a curious textbook\r\nentitled _Gorden's Geography_. The Enigmas were usually stated and\r\nanswered in verse, and sometimes they were in French or Latin. The\r\narithmetical questions often involved in answer a page or two of\r\nalgebraic formulæ or even the processes of geometry or trigonometry.\r\nAs a rule the ladies were especially interested in the Enigmas,\r\nleaving the mathematical portions to the men of letters, clergymen,\r\nand schoolmasters who solaced their winter evenings with the stimuli\r\noffered by the _Woman's Almanack_. Yet the editor asserts that even\r\nin mathematics the ladies often proved themselves very skillful. In\r\nthe introduction in 1718 he says:\r\n\r\n  And, that the rest of the Fair Sex may be encourag'd to attempt\r\n  Mathematics and Philosophical Knowledge, they here see that\r\n  their Sex have as clear Judgements, a sprightly quick Wit, a\r\n  penetrating Genius, and as discerning and sagacious Faculties\r\n  as ours, and to my Knowledge do, and can, carry them thro'\r\n  the most difficult Problems. I have seen them solve, and am\r\n  fully convinc'd, their Works in the Ladies _Diary_ are their\r\n  own Solutions and Compositions. This we may glory in as the\r\n  _Amazons_ of our Nation; and Foreigners would be amaz'd when I\r\n  shew them no less than 4 or 5 Hundred several Letters from so\r\n  many several Women, with Solutions _Geometrical_, _Arithmetical_,\r\n  _Algebraical_, _Astronomical_ and _Philosophical_.\r\n\r\nThe solemnity with which contributors devoted themselves to the\r\n_Diaries_, the stately compliments interchanged over successful work,\r\nprovoke a smile, but yet it must be confessed that no other agency\r\nbetween 1703 and 1726 offered to women so genuine an intellectual\r\nopportunity. To some women it was literally a perennial joy. Who were\r\nthe _Astræa_ and the _Adrastea_ whose names are so often in the prize\r\nlist? Who, in particular, was _Anna Philomathes_, who could write up\r\nwhole numbers, questions and answers, and who kept at the business\r\nsteadily for eleven years? From what homes did the \"4 or 5 Hundred\r\nseveral Letters\" of the editor's note come? That the _Tatlers_, the\r\n_Spectators_, and the _Guardians_ should have their thousands of\r\nreaders is easily explicable. But do not the now obscure _Diaries_\r\nindicate a more unusual mental energy, a more genuine delight in\r\npersonal mental activity? In many a home, geographies, arithmetics,\r\nhistories, classical dictionaries, would surround the \"Fair-Sex\"\r\nas they devoted themselves with leisurely assiduity to the demands\r\nof the _Diary_ for the ensuing year. And a prize or an honorable\r\nmention marked a gratifying mental achievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Guardian (1713)]\r\n\r\nIn _The Guardian_, No. 155, we have an account of how melancholy\r\na thing it is to see a coxcomb at the head of a family. The paper\r\nproceeds:\r\n\r\n  This is one reason why I would the more recommend the\r\n  improvements of the mind to my female readers, that a family may\r\n  have a double chance for it; and if it meets with weakness in\r\n  one of the heads, may have it made up in the other. It is indeed\r\n  an unhappy circumstance in a family, where the wife has more\r\n  knowledge than the husband; but it is better it should be so,\r\n  than that there should be no knowledge in the whole house. It\r\n  is highly expedient that at least one of the persons, who sits\r\n  at the helm of affairs, should give an example of good sense to\r\n  those who are under them.\r\n\r\n  I have often wondered that learning is not thought a proper\r\n  ingredient in the education of a woman of quality or fortune.\r\n  Since they have the same improveable minds as the male part\r\n  of the species, why should they not be cultivated by the same\r\n  method? Why should reason be left to itself in one of the sexes,\r\n  and be disciplined with so much care in the other?\r\n\r\n  There are some reasons why learning seems more adapted to the\r\n  female world, than to the male. As in the first place, because\r\n  they have more spare time upon their hands, and lead a more\r\n  sedentary life. Their employments are of a domestic nature, and\r\n  not like those of the other sex, which are often inconsistent\r\n  with study and contemplation. The excellent lady, the lady\r\n  Lizard, in the space of one summer furnished a gallery with\r\n  chairs and couches of her own and her daughters' working; and at\r\n  the same time heard all doctor Tillotson's sermons twice over. It\r\n  is always the custom for one of the young ladies to read, while\r\n  the others are at work; so that the learning of the family is not\r\n  at all prejudicial to its manufactures. I was mightily pleased\r\n  the other day to find them all busy in preserving several fruits\r\n  of the season, with the Sparkler in the midst of them, reading\r\n  over the Plurality of Worlds. It was very entertaining to me to\r\n  see them dividing their speculations between jellies and stars,\r\n  and making a sudden transition from the sun to an apricot, or\r\n  from the Copernican system to the figure of a cheesecake.\r\n\r\n  There is another reason why those especially who are women of\r\n  quality, should apply themselves to letters, namely, because\r\n  their husbands are generally strangers to them.\r\n\r\n  It is a great pity there should be no knowledge in a family. For\r\n  my own part, I am concerned, when I go into a great house, when\r\n  perhaps there is not a single person that can spell, unless it\r\n  be by chance the butler, or one of the footmen. What a figure is\r\n  their young heir likely to make, who is a dunce both by father's\r\n  and mother's side![428]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ladies' Library (1714)]\r\n\r\nAddison and Steele had in mind some publication such as _The Ladies'\r\nLibrary_ at least three years before it appeared. On April 12, 1711\r\n(No. 37), Addison described in _The Spectator_ the library of a lady\r\ncalled Leonora.[429] She had assembled her books partly in accordance\r\nwith her own taste, partly on the principle that there were some\r\nbooks no library could do without. The list is an interesting one:\r\n\r\n  _Ogleby's Virgil._\r\n\r\n  _Dryden's Juvenal._\r\n\r\n  _Casandra._\r\n\r\n  _Astræa._\r\n\r\n  Sir _Isaac Newton's_ Works.\r\n\r\n  The _Grand Cyrus_: with a Pin stuck in one of the middle Leaves.\r\n\r\n  _Pembroke's Arcadia._\r\n\r\n  _Lock_ of Human Understanding: with a Paper of Patches in it.\r\n\r\n  A Spelling book.\r\n\r\n  A Dictionary for the Explanation of hard Words.\r\n\r\n  _Sherlock_ upon Death.\r\n\r\n  The fifteen Comforts of Matrimony.\r\n\r\n  Sir _William Temple's_ Essays.\r\n\r\n  Father _Malebranche's_ Search after Truth, translated into\r\n  English.\r\n\r\n  A Book of Novelles.\r\n\r\n  The Academy of Compliments.\r\n\r\n  _Culpepper_'s Midwifery.\r\n\r\n  The Ladies' Calling.\r\n\r\n  Tales in Verse by Mr. _Durfey_: Bound in Red Leather, gilt on the\r\n  Back, and doubled down in several Places.\r\n\r\n  All the Classick Authors in Wood.\r\n\r\n  A Set of _Elzivers_ by the same Hand.\r\n\r\n  _Clelia_: Which opened of itself in the Place that described two\r\n  Lovers in a Bower.\r\n\r\n  _Baker's_ Chronicle.\r\n\r\n  Advice to a Daughter.\r\n\r\n  The New _Atalantis_, with a Key to it.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Steele's _Christian Heroe_.\r\n\r\n  A Prayer Book: With a Battle of _Hungary_ Water by the side of it.\r\n\r\n  Dr. _Sacheverell_'s Speech.\r\n\r\n  _Fielding_'s Tryal.\r\n\r\n  _Seneca_'s Morals.\r\n\r\n  _Taylor's_ Holy Living and Dying.\r\n\r\n  _Le Ferte_'s Instructions for Country Dances.\r\n\r\nAfter some comment on this list as not in all respects desirable,\r\nAddison stated that it was his purpose soon to suggest a catalogue\r\nof books that would be proper for the improvement of the sex. In\r\nMay (No. 79) of the same year a lady named \"B. D.\" reminded _The\r\nSpectator_ of this promise, and urged that in his catalogue of a\r\nFemale Library he would pay particular attention to devotional works.\r\nIn June (No. 92) _The Spectator_ gives an account of the letters\r\nreceived by the editor in answer to his call for help in making up\r\nhis \"Catalogue of a Lady's Library.\" Book-sellers recommend the\r\nauthors they have printed; husbands give the preference to Wingate's\r\n_Arithmetic_, the Countess of Kent's _Receipts, The Government of the\r\nTongue_. Ladies send in all sorts of advice. \"Coquetilla begs me not\r\nto think of nailing Women upon their Knees with Manuals of Devotion,\r\nnor of scorching their Faces with Books of Housewifry.\" French\r\nromances and plays rank among the most popular sorts of reading. _The\r\nSpectator_ renews his promise to search out in authors ancient and\r\nmodern the passages most suitable for women, a work of this nature\r\nbeing the more necessary since most books are calculated for male\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nIn August (No. 140) \"Parthenia\" writes concerning her disappointment\r\non reading the description of Leonora's Library which she finds no\r\ntrue guide at all, and she urges _The Spectator_ to more earnest\r\nefforts in behalf of the sex:\r\n\r\n  The great desire I have to Embellish my Mind with some of those\r\n  Graces which you say are so becoming, and which you assert\r\n  Reading helps us to, has made me uneasie 'till I am put in a\r\n  capacity of attaining them: This, Sir, I shall never think my\r\n  self in, 'till you shall be pleased to recommend some Author\r\n  or Authors to my Perusal.... I write to you not only my own\r\n  Sentiments, but also those of several other of my Acquaintance,\r\n  who are as little pleased with the ordinary manner of spending\r\n  one's Time as myself: And if a fervent Desire after Knowledge,\r\n  and a great Sense of our present Ignorance, may be thought a good\r\n  presage and earnest of Improvement you may look upon your Time\r\n  you shall bestow in answering this Request not thrown away to no\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this preliminary discussion the scheme was not\r\nimmediately carried out. In November, 1712 (No. 528), \"Rachel\r\nWelladay\" wrote reproachfully: \"You never have given us the Catalogue\r\nof a Lady's Library as you promised.\" And it was not till 1714\r\nthat _The Ladies' Library_ was published by Steele. Though in\r\nthree volumes and quite expensive, it became at once so popular\r\nthat there was an eighth edition by 1772.[430] The book was said\r\nto be \"Written by a Lady,\" but it is in reality a compilation from\r\nseventeenth-century authors. In the _Athenæum_ (July 5, 1884) is\r\nan article by Mr. Aitkin in which the chief passages are traced to\r\nTaylor's _Holy Living_ (168 pages), Fleetwood's _Relative Duties of\r\nParents and Children_, _The Whole Duty of Man_, _The Government of\r\nthe Tongue_, _The Ladies' Calling_ (208 pages), Locke's _Treatise\r\non Education_, Lucas's _Practical Christianity and Enquiry after\r\nHappiness_, Scott's _Christian Life_, Tillotson's _Sermons_, Mary\r\nAstell's _Serious Proposal_ (86 pages), Halifax's _Advice to a\r\nDaughter_ (47 pages), Hickes's _Education of a Daughter_. Angry\r\ncharges were brought against Steele for his use of such copious\r\nextracts from Jeremy Taylor, as \"an infringement on the rights of\r\nthe poor orphans who have very little else to subsist on,\"[431] and\r\nMary Astell commented satirically on the consistency of the author\r\nwho had shown his teeth against her _Serious Proposal_ and then had\r\ntranscribed \"above a hundred pages of it\" into his _Ladies' Library_.\r\nBut no individual cavils interfered with the general approval. The\r\nbook was received as an extremely judicious compilation of the\r\nbest passages from authoritative sources. _The Ladies' Calling_,\r\n_Advice to a Daughter_, _A Serious Proposal_, and _The Education of\r\na Daughter_, however unacceptable to modern thought many of their\r\nfundamental assumptions and practical rules may be, represented the\r\nhighest and most dignified contemporary views as to the rights and\r\nresponsibilities of women. Brought together thus in one survey these\r\nideas would make a cumulative impression. There was nothing in the\r\nquotations to antagonize or terrify the most conservative religious\r\nreaders, yet the total effect of the book would be a recognition of\r\nwoman's ability to think on important and difficult questions, and\r\nthe outcome would be to give her insensibly a more honorable place in\r\nhome, social, and church life.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gentleman Instructed (8th ed., 1728)]\r\n\r\nIn the _Supplement to The Gentleman Instructed_ there is an animated\r\npresentation of the faults of women. Eusebius, the sage who is to\r\ninstruct Neander in the duties of a gentleman, becomes so caustic in\r\nhis attacks on women that Emilia presents the matter to a \"Juncto\"\r\nof ladies assembled to discuss the fashions. Emilia and Lucia are\r\nappointed to wait on Eusebius and explain to him that a \"Select\r\nCommittee of Ladies\" require satisfaction at his hands. Neander\r\nproceeds in lively fashion to lay open the faults of ladies, their\r\nidleness, frivolity, vanity, and ignorance. During an arraignment\r\nso detailed and knowing it is small wonder that the envoys \"sate\r\nupon the Tenters,\" and received the witty summary of their sins with\r\nfloods of tears, or with torrents of angry words. On the entrance of\r\nNeander the colloquy takes a milder tone and Eusebius shows that he\r\nhas \"Balms to heal, as well as Causticks to blister.\" By a panegyric\r\nof noble and virtuous women he \"dashes the _aigre_ with the _doux_,\"\r\nand shows that he can speak \"like a Gentleman as well as an Orator.\"\r\nHe further modifies his harsh attitude by attributing feminine faults\r\nto defects in education. In answer to Neander's question as to the\r\n\"Cause of our Ladies' Misfortune,\" Eusebius responds:\r\n\r\n  It's indeed a Misfortune, but almost Universal; it's spread\r\n  over the whole World, and affects the whole Species. _Emilia_\r\n  has touched the Cause, ill Education: This is the fatal Source\r\n  of their Misery, the true Origin of all their Failings. Young\r\n  Ladies are brought up as if God created 'em merely for Seraglio,\r\n  and that their only Business was to charm a brutish _Sultan_:\r\n  One would think they had no Souls, there is such a Care taken\r\n  of their Bodies; that God had enacted a Salique Law as well\r\n  as the _French_, and excluded the Sex from the Inheritance of\r\n  Heaven.[432]\r\n\r\nLater Eusebius has so far conquered the opposition of the two ladies\r\nas to venture upon specific good advice:\r\n\r\n  Pretend not in Company to Wit; you will certainly betray your\r\n  Judgment. Women seldom appear more foolish, than when they aspire\r\n  to the Glory of being thought wise. Good God! How was I plague'd\r\n  t'other Day with the Impertinence of Madam H. She commented\r\n  upon _Aristotle_, and Lectur'd us upon the _Summe_ of _Thomas\r\n  Aquinas_. She scorn'd the Female Topick of Modes and Dresses, and\r\n  was for dancing on the high Ropes of _Physicks_ and _Divinity_.\r\n  We were first regaled with _Materia Prima_; then came up a Dish\r\n  of _Occult Qualities_; and at last a whole Plate of Theological\r\n  Terms were flung among the Company. It was as impossible to stop\r\n  her in this learned Career, as a Ship under full Sail, and you\r\n  might have sooner silenc'd a Hurricane, than have fetter'd her\r\n  Ladyship's Tongue. The Sex admir'd her Wisdom, and the Men smil'd\r\n  at her Folly. She is [_sic_] made a Provision of School Jargon,\r\n  and laid it out with much Prodigality, and more Assurance. But\r\n  all her Knowledge stuck on the Superficies of Words, she enter'd\r\n  not into the Sense. So that the Fame of her Parts shrunk under\r\n  Experience, and this Phœnix of women prov'd only a well-taught\r\n  Parrot.[433]\r\n\r\nTo a eulogy of needlework he adds:\r\n\r\n  You may season Works with Reading, for though Women should not\r\n  pretend to commence Doctors, yet I would not have 'em forswear\r\n  Knowledge, nor make a Vow of Stupidity. Indeed it's not necessary\r\n  to Rival the Knowledge of the Sybils, nor the Science of the\r\n  Muses, she should not wade too deep into Controversy, nor\r\n  soar so high as Divinity. These Studies lie out of a Lady's\r\n  Way: They fly up to the Head, and not only intoxicate weak\r\n  Brains, but turn them; They engender Pride, and blow us up with\r\n  Self-conceitedness, and when all these meet, we shall be apt to\r\n  measure Faith by our private Judgment, and set up our ill-shap'd\r\n  Notions against the receiv'd Tenets of our Religion.[434]\r\n\r\nEusebius joins with nearly all contemporary moralists in a\r\ncondemnation of romances:\r\n\r\n  Let not Romances come within reach of a young Lady: They are\r\n  the Poison of Youth and murther Souls, as sure as Arsenick or\r\n  Rats-bane kills Bodies.... Alas, when a young Creature reads\r\n  over flourish'd Descriptions of conquering Beauties, and captive\r\n  Knights; what a fine Landskip will they draw in her Head? How\r\n  powerfully will they work upon her tender Heart? What a Tumult\r\n  will they raise in her Breast?... How often will they envy a\r\n  Philoclea for having a _Pyrocles_ at her Feet, and how seriously\r\n  will she wish herself in the Place of Pamelia. Nay, it's odd,\r\n  when the Fancy is warm'd, and the Imagination charm'd with the\r\n  advantageous Characters of those Platonick Knights, she may fall\r\n  in Love with the bare Product of _Sidney's_ Brain, and become a\r\n  real Slave to Fable and Fiction.[435]\r\n\r\nSo convincing was Eusebius that Emilia said on leaving:\r\n\r\n  To complete the Favour, be pleas'd to oblige me with your\r\n  Instruction in Writing. Memory is Treacherous, and we often\r\n  forget those Things that should always be remembered: Besides\r\n  the Benefit is too important to be confined to a private Person.\r\n  My Disease is Epidemical, and you will find few Ladies in Court\r\n  untainted: Pray let the Remedy be publick. I will send it to\r\n  the Press with your Leave, and present it to our Sex with a\r\n  Dedication.\r\n\r\nThen the ladies took leave of Eusebius and drove home. \"They were\r\nas calm as a spring Morning, and of Enemies became _Eusebius's_\r\nAdmirers.\"[436]\r\n\r\nIn the _Supplement to The Gentleman Instructed_ there is little that\r\nis constructive so far as education is concerned. The faults of women\r\nare wittily and picturesquely phrased, but no substitute scheme of\r\nlife is offered. Wherever learning is specifically spoken of it is\r\nwith derision.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advice to a Lady (1731)]\r\n\r\nLord Lyttleton wrote in 1731, when he was but twenty-two, a poem\r\nentitled \"Advice to a Lady\" in which he reiterated the commonplaces\r\nof the day. He counsels an \"elegance of mind as well as dress,\"\r\nbut strictly limits the exercise of such mentality as the lady may\r\npossess:\r\n\r\n      Nor make to dangerous wit a vain pretence,\r\n      But wisely rest content with modest sense;\r\n      For wit, like wine, intoxicates the brain,\r\n      Too strong for feeble woman to sustain:\r\n      Of those who claim it more than half have none;\r\n      And half of those who have it are undone.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Seek to be good but aim not to be great:\r\n      A woman's noblest station is retreat:\r\n      Her fairest virtues fly from public sight,\r\n      Domestic worth, that shuns too strong a light.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the prudent wife towards her husband is also\r\nindicated:\r\n\r\n      From kind concern about his weal or woe,\r\n      Let each domestic duty seem to flow,\r\n      The _household sceptre_ if he bids you bear,\r\n      Make it your pride his _servant_ to appear;\r\n      Endearing thus the common acts of life.\r\n      The _mistress_ still shall charm him in the wife.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson thought this poem showed a mind attentive to life, that\r\nit was vigorously and very elegantly expressed, and that it was\r\nmarked by much truth and much prudence. But Lady Mary Wortley Montagu\r\nsummarized Lord Lyttleton's platitude in a contemptuous couplet:\r\n\r\n      Be plain in dress, and sober in your diet;\r\n      In short, my deary, kiss me! and be quiet.\r\n\r\nIn 1744 Edward Moore published his _Fables for Ladies_.[437] In\r\nthirteen rather smoothly versified little tales he enforces the\r\nordinary maxims included in the accepted social creed for women.\r\nOnly the last one goes out of the realm of decorum and domesticity.\r\nIn \"The Owl and the Nightingale\" the Nightingale represents the woman\r\nwho \"minds the duties of her nest\" and sings the song taught her by\r\nnature, and so gains applause from man and bird. The opposite type is\r\nrepresented by the Owl who, puffed up with self-conceit, spends her\r\ntime in pedantry and sloth. The owl-like lady vaunts her own wits,\r\ntwits her husband with his inferiority, and lets her children go\r\nragged and dirty.\r\n\r\n      With books her litter'd floor is spread,\r\n      Of nameless authors, never read;\r\n      Foul linen, petticoats, and lace\r\n      Fill up the intermediate space.\r\n      Abroad, at visitings, her tongue\r\n      Is never still, and always wrong;\r\n      All meanings she defines away,\r\n      And stands, with truth and sense, at bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Samuel Richardson]\r\n\r\nSamuel Richardson was the first to make feminism an issue in fiction.\r\nPamela and Clarissa Harlowe have the characteristics counted ideal by\r\nRichardson, and both of these young ladies have not only exceptional\r\nfacility with the pen, but they have an education superior to that\r\nof most girls of their day, and they have educational ideas far\r\nahead of their time. Though Clarissa was very young when she died,\r\nshe is represented as having accomplished much. In fine needlework\r\nshe excelled cloistered nuns, pieces of her work being sent even\r\nto Italy to show the skill of English maidens. She had a pretty\r\nhand at drawing, and, even when her execution was faulty, she was\r\nnevertheless \"absolute mistress in the _should-be_ of art.\" She knew\r\nFrench and Italian well, and had read the chief poetry in those\r\ntongues as well as in English. She had also begun Latin. She read\r\naloud fluently and correctly, with grace and dramatic effect. Her\r\nmaxim was, \"All that a woman can learn above the useful knowledge\r\nproper to her sex, _let her learn_.\" But she had no patience with a\r\n\"learned slattern,\" and deprecated any education that could turn a\r\nwoman away from domestic economy. Pamela was but sixteen when she\r\nmarried and her education had been in the main that gained through\r\nfour years with Lady B. But after her marriage she settles into\r\na routine of life, one element of which is three hours a day for\r\nstudy. Italian, French, geography, and arithmetic receive particular\r\nattention. The chief pleasures in her home are intellectual ones.\r\nHer first theatrical season in London presents her in the rôle of\r\ndramatic critic. Ambrose Philips's _The Distressed Mother_ and\r\nSteele's _Tender Husband_ had awakened tears and laughter from a\r\ngeneration of play-goers, before Pamela, self-appointed censor of\r\nthe stage, revealed their immoralities and improbabilities. It is\r\nalso Pamela who is chosen to lay bare the absurdities of the Italian\r\nopera. At her husband's wish she writes an extended essay in which\r\nshe dissects Locke's _Treatise on Education_ with explanatory and\r\ncritical comments. Furthermore, quite apart from these technicalities\r\nof education, Richardson has given to Pamela, Clarissa, and Miss Howe\r\nan independent personality. They are not mere puppets of relatives or\r\nof circumstances. They strive valiantly to direct the course of their\r\nlives according to the dictates of their own reason and conscience.\r\nParents and husbands are not the arbiters of their destiny. They hold\r\nto their own views in spite of adverse public opinion and private\r\nauthority. Nor do they cling to their theories with a mere meek and\r\nsilent obstinacy. They argue down all opponents. The whys and the\r\nwherefores are at their tongues' end. Conscience, mind, and will are\r\nin their own keeping.\r\n\r\nThese striking characteristics of Richardson's heroines present in\r\nconcrete form opinions frequently stated by him in his letters. Those\r\nto Lady Bradshaigh are sufficient to indicate the stand he took. This\r\ncorrespondence belongs in 1750 and 1751. The more important letters\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n  _Lady Bradshaigh to Richardson._\r\n\r\n  I own I do not approve of great learning in women. I believe it\r\n  rarely turns out to their advantage. No farther would I have them\r\n  to advance, than to what would enable them to write and converse\r\n  with propriety, and make themselves useful in every stage of\r\n  life. I hate to hear Latin out of a woman's mouth. There is\r\n  something in it, to me, masculine. I could fancy such a one weary\r\n  of the petticoat, and talking over the bottle. You say \"the men\r\n  are hastening apace into dictionary learning.\" The less occasion\r\n  still for the ladies to proceed in their's. I should be ashamed\r\n  of having more learning than my husband. And could we, do you\r\n  think, help shewing a little contempt, finding ourselves superior\r\n  in what the husband ought to excel in. Very few women have\r\n  strength of brain equal to such a trial: and as few men would\r\n  forego their lordly prerogative, and submit to a woman of better\r\n  understanding, either natural or acquired. A very uncomfortable\r\n  life do I see between an ignorant husband and a learned wife. Not\r\n  that I would have it thought unnecessary for a woman to read,\r\n  to spell, or speak English; which has been pretty much the case\r\n  hitherto. I often wonder we can converse at all; much more, that\r\n  we can write to be understood. Thanks to nature for what we have!\r\n\r\n  _Richardson to Lady Bradshaigh._\r\n\r\n  _Dear Madam_,\r\n\r\n  You do not approve of great learning in women. Learning in women\r\n  may be rightly or wrongly placed, according to the uses made of\r\n  them. And if the sex is to be brought up with a view to make the\r\n  individuals of it inferior in knowledge to the husbands they may\r\n  happen to have, not knowing who those husbands are, or what, or\r\n  whether sensible or foolish, learned or illiterate, it would be\r\n  best to keep them from writing or reading, and even from the\r\n  knowledge of the common idioms of speech. Would it not be very\r\n  pretty for the parents on both sides to make it the first subject\r\n  of their inquiries, whether the girl as a recommendation, were\r\n  a greater fool, or more ignorant, than the young fellow; and if\r\n  not, that they should reject her, for the booby's sake?--and\r\n  would not your objection stand as strongly against a preference\r\n  in mother-wit in the girl, as against what is called learning;\r\n  since linguists, (I will not call all linguists, learned men,) do\r\n  very seldom make the figure in conversation that even girls, from\r\n  sixteen to twenty, make.\r\n\r\n  If a woman have genius, let it take its course, as well as in\r\n  men: provided she neglect not anything that is more peculiarly\r\n  her province. If she has good sense, she will not make the man\r\n  she chuses, who wants her knowledge, uneasy, nor despise him for\r\n  that want. Her good sense will teach her what is her duty; nor\r\n  will she want reminding of the tenor of her marriage vow to him.\r\n  If she has not, she will find a thousand ways to plague him,\r\n  though she knew not one word beyond her mother-tongue, nor how to\r\n  write, read, or speak properly in that. The English, Madam, and\r\n  particularly what we call the plain English, is a very copious\r\n  and a very expressive language.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Bradshaigh to Richardson._\r\n\r\n  I will not approve of learning in women. You, not even you,\r\n  shall persuade me to it; that is no farther than I have already\r\n  allowed which I think is pretty extensively; let them study that,\r\n  domestic duties, and other necessary acquirements, and they will\r\n  have employment enough to keep them out of mischief, if their\r\n  inclinations are not strong that way: and if they were as learned\r\n  as the most learned you can name, I have a notion these same\r\n  whisperings must, in some degree, be attended to; and whilst\r\n  they have ears they will be open to flattery and whilst men have\r\n  tongues these ears will be filled with it. Learning cannot change\r\n  nature, but it can make a woman ridiculous, a woman of sense I\r\n  mean. Then, if it was once become customary, all parents would\r\n  think their children qualified, and say, \"If, please God, my girl\r\n  shall be a scholar,\" as the men say of their boys, boobies or\r\n  not: and what figures would most of us make!--Everything moves\r\n  easiest in its own sphere. Indeed, Sir, great learning would make\r\n  strange work of us. You know we are to submit and obey; and it\r\n  is much as ever we can do, often more, in our inferior state of\r\n  knowledge. I speak of acquired learning. What we have from good\r\n  sense and natural genius, nobody can take from us. And the more\r\n  a woman has of those, the better she must appear if along with\r\n  those, she has good nature and humility.\r\n\r\n  _Richardson to Lady Bradshaigh._\r\n\r\n  Your Ladyship will not \"approve of learning in women.\" I cannot\r\n  help it. But do you not think, Madam, that the woman, who,\r\n  additionally to the advantages she has from nature, \"has been\r\n  taught to read and converse with ease and propriety\"; who can\r\n  read, spell, and speak English; may not be as justly feared by\r\n  half the pretty fellows of this age, as if she could read and\r\n  understand Latin?\r\n\r\n  I do not allow, that because a man is superficial, a woman must\r\n  be so too, for fear she should meet with a husband to whom\r\n  she may have a superior understanding. Do you not remember\r\n  whose these words are? \"What a pity it is that true genius\r\n  and merit should be veiled under the cloud of inactivity and\r\n  modesty.\"--\"Strange! (adds this favourite of mine) that people\r\n  will wrap up their talents and hide them.\"\r\n\r\n  In your Ladyship's, of January 6, you say, \"I hate to hear\r\n  Latin out of a woman's mouth: there is something in it to me\r\n  masculine. I could fancy such a one weary of the petticoat, and\r\n  talking over a bottle.\" But, in this case, will not vanity and\r\n  conceit shew themselves, where they are predominant, in a man's\r\n  as much as in a woman's mind? Are there not pedantic men? Miss\r\n  C----[438] is an example that woman may be trusted with Latin and\r\n  even Greek, and yet not think themselves above their domestic\r\n  duties. But after all, I contend not that women should be taught\r\n  either of these languages; nor do I hold languages to be great\r\n  learning, as I hinted in my former. A linguist and a learned man\r\n  may very well be two persons. Meantime, all that I contend for,\r\n  is, that genius, whether in men or women, should take its course:\r\n  that, as the ray of divinity, it should not be suppressed. But\r\n  I acknowledge that the great and indispensable duties of women\r\n  are of the domestic kind; and that, if a woman neglect these,\r\n  or despise them, for the sake of science itself, which I call\r\n  learning, she is good for nothing.\r\n\r\n  But would you not, Madam, have called me by some hard name, had I\r\n  supposed the sex, in general, so conceited, so self-sufficient,\r\n  so naturally weak in judgment, as you do? and had I asserted,\r\n  that the more they knew, the worse they would be for it? I\r\n  believe, I have observed in a former, that neither of us will let\r\n  anyone but ourselves speak slightly of the sex.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Bradshaigh to Richardson (March 29_, 1751).\r\n\r\n  I think we pretty nearly agree, as to learning in women. And\r\n  I was glad to find our opinion corresponding with an author\r\n  esteemed by the judicious. In the letters of Balzac to Mr.\r\n  Chapelain, are the following words: \"I could more willingly\r\n  tolerate a woman with a beard, than one that pretends to\r\n  learning. In earnest, had I authority in the civil government, I\r\n  would condemn all those women to the distaff, that undertook to\r\n  write books, that transform their souls by masculine disguise,\r\n  and break the rank they hold in the world.\"\r\n\r\nFew bits of correspondence could be more illuminating. Lady\r\nBradshaigh holds the conventional mid-century view while Richardson\r\nrepresents the most advanced feminist ideas of his day. Mrs. Makin,\r\nMary Astell, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and \"Sophia\" asked hardly\r\nmore than Richardson freely grants.\r\n\r\nIn his letters to Miss Margaret Collier, Richardson is most earnest\r\nin his defense of literary women. In answer to her complaint that\r\nFielding's _Voyage to Lisbon_ was counted an inferior work and hence\r\nattributed to her, he \"inveighed vehemently\" against women who\r\npublished anonymously, and wished it in his power to punish those\r\ngeniuses of the female sex who studiously \"wrapped up their napkin'd\r\ntalents,\" elaborately concealing their \"God-_given_ talents.\" \"What\r\nis it that they fear?... Is it that the men will be afraid of them,\r\nand shun them as wives? Unworthy fear! Let the wretches shun and be\r\nafraid of them. Unworthy of such blessings, let such men not dare\r\nto look up to merits so superior to their own; and let them enter\r\ninto contract with women, whose sense is as diminutive as their own\r\nsouls.\" Miss Collier answers (with a deep sigh) that a preference\r\nfor \"little-minded creatures\" and an aversion to women of uncommon\r\nunderstanding is not confined to the wretches he anathematizes, but\r\nis as characteristic of \"men of real good sense, great parts, and\r\nmany fine qualities.\" Miss Collier styles Richardson \"the vindicator\"\r\nof her sex, but he holds his wrath and asks, \"Who shall vindicate the\r\nhonour of a sex, the most excellent of which desert themselves?\"[439]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry Fielding]\r\n\r\nFielding has, in _Tom Jones_, an entertaining learned lady in the\r\nperson of Mrs. Western, the sister of Squire Western. She was of\r\na masculine form, near six foot high, which, added to her manner\r\nand learning, possibly prevented the other sex from regarding her,\r\nnotwithstanding her petticoats, in the light of a woman. \"She had\r\nconsiderably improved her mind by study; she had not only read all\r\nthe modern plays, operas, oratorios, poems, and romances--in all\r\nwhich she was a critic--but had gone through Rapin's _History of\r\nEngland_, Eachard's _Roman History_, and many French _Mémoires pour\r\nservir à l'Histoire_: to these she had added most of the political\r\npamphlets and journals published within the last twenty years. From\r\nwhich she had obtained a very competent skill in politics, and could\r\ndiscourse very learnedly on the affairs of Europe.\" Squire Western\r\ndid not approve of his sister's learned tastes. \"You know,\" he says,\r\n\"I do not love to hear you talk about politics; they belong to us,\r\nand petticoats should not meddle.\"\r\n\r\nBut in Fielding's attitude towards his sister's work, and in the\r\npersonal opinions he expressed in the prefaces to her novels,\r\nwe find quite a different tone.[440] Mrs. Western represented a\r\nself-assertive, pretentious woman whose claim to learning was without\r\njustification, and as such Fielding satirized her. For a modest woman\r\nof real learning and ability Fielding had great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pompey the Little (1757)]\r\n\r\nIn Coventry's _Pompey the Little_ is a satirical sketch of a \"Lady\r\nSophister\" who had visited most of the courts of Europe and who\r\naffected a character of wisdom. We first meet her at the bedside\r\nof Lady Tempest who is being attended by Dr. Kildarby and Dr.\r\nRhubarb. Lady Sophister had associated with the _literati_ in France\r\n\"where the ladies affect a reputation of science, and are able to\r\ndiscourse on the profoundest questions of theology and philosophy.\"\r\nShe had somehow caught up with the notion that the soul is not\r\nimmortal, and she never found herself in the company of learned men\r\nwithout launching forth into a discussion of this subject. \"This\r\nextraordinary principle, to show that she did not take up her notions\r\nlightly and wantonly, she was able to demonstrate; and could appeal\r\nto the greatest authorities in defence of it. She had read Hobbes,\r\nMalebranche, Locke, Shaftesbury, Woolaston, and many more. But Locke\r\nwas her principal favourite, and consequently she rested chiefly upon\r\nhim to furnish her with quotations whenever her ladyship pleased to\r\nengage in controversy.\" She attacks the two doctors with, \"Have you\r\never read Mr. Locke's controversy with the Bishop of Worcester?\"\r\nand hardly waiting to triumph over their confused attempts to\r\nevade the question she proceeds: \"What do you esteem the soul to\r\nbe? Is it air, or fire, or æther, or a kind of quintessence, as\r\nAristotle observed--a composition of all the elements?... You know\r\nMr. Locke observes there are various kinds of matter. But first we\r\nshould define matter, which, you know, the logicians tell us is an\r\nextended solid substance. Out of this matter some is made into rose\r\nand peach-trees; the next form which matter takes is animal life;\r\nfrom whence we have lions and elephants and all the race of brutes:\r\nthen the last, as Mr. Locke observes, is thought, and reason, and\r\nvolition, from whence are created men; and therefore, you plainly\r\nsee it is impossible for the soul to be immortal.\" Dr. Rhubarb is\r\ndazed by this fluent reasoning, but protests he can recall nothing\r\nin Locke about roses and peach-trees and elephants and lions. \"Nay,\r\nsir,\" cried she, \"can you deny me this? If the soul is fire, it\r\nmust be extinguished; if air, it must be dispersed; if it be only\r\na modification of matter, then of course it ceases when matter is\r\nno longer modified; if it be anything else, it is exactly the same\r\nthing: and therefore you must confess--indeed, doctor, you must\r\nconfess--that it is impossible for the soul to be immortal.\"[441]\r\nBefore such a rapid fire of phrases the doctors retire discomfited.\r\nIt was generally thought that Mr. Coventry meant this sketch for Lady\r\nOrford, but even without this personal reference the passage would\r\nstand as Coventry's estimate of many of the women of his day who were\r\ndevoting themselves to metaphysics and knots of divinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jonathan Swift]\r\n\r\nThere is no more concise summing up of the arguments generally\r\nadvanced against the education of women in the first half of the\r\neighteenth century than that given by Swift in the opening paragraphs\r\nof his essay entitled _On the Education of Ladies_:\r\n\r\n  It is argued that the great end of marriage is propagation;\r\n  that, consequently, the principal business of a wife is to breed\r\n  children, and to take care of them in their infancy: That the\r\n  wife is to look to her family, watch over the servants, see\r\n  that they do their work: That she be absent from her house as\r\n  little as possible: That she is answerable for everything amiss\r\n  in the family: That she is to obey all the lawful commands\r\n  of her husband, and visit or be visited by no persons whom\r\n  he disapproves: That her whole business, if well performed,\r\n  will take up most hours of the day: That the greater she is,\r\n  and the more servants she keeps, her inspection must increase\r\n  accordingly: for, as a family represents a kingdom, so the wife,\r\n  who is her husband's first minister, must, under him, direct\r\n  all the officers of state, even to the lowest; and report their\r\n  behavior to her husband, as the first minister does to his\r\n  prince: That such a station requires much time, and thought,\r\n  and order; and, if well executed, leaves but little time for\r\n  visits or diversions: That a humor of reading books, except\r\n  those of devotion or housewifery, is apt to turn a woman's\r\n  brain: That plays, romances, novels, and love-poems, are only\r\n  proper to instruct them how to carry on an intrigue: That all\r\n  affectation of knowledge, beyond what is merely domestic, renders\r\n  them vain, conceited, and pretending: That the natural levity\r\n  of woman wants ballast; and when she once begins to think she\r\n  knows more than others of her sex, she will begin to despise\r\n  her husband, and grow fond of every coxcomb who pretends to any\r\n  knowledge in books: That she will learn scholastic words; make\r\n  herself ridiculous by pronouncing them wrong, and applying them\r\n  absurdly in all companies: That in the meantime, her househould\r\n  affairs, and the care of her children, will be wholly laid\r\n  aside; her toilet will be crowded with all the under-wits, where\r\n  the conversation will pass in criticising on the last play or\r\n  poem that comes out, and she will be careful to remember all\r\n  the remarks that were made, in order to retail them in the next\r\n  visit, especially in company who know nothing of the matter:\r\n  That she will have all the impertinence of a pedant, without the\r\n  knowledge; and for every new acquirement, will become so much the\r\n  worse.[442]\r\n\r\nThis essay breaks off abruptly so that we cannot tell in what\r\nspirit Swift planned to carry on the discussion. But in \"A Letter\r\nto a Very Young Lady on her Marriage\"[443] we get a somewhat fuller\r\nstatement showing his contempt for women in general, but indicating\r\npossibilities in the way of improvement in specific cases:\r\n\r\n  As divines say, That some people take more pains to be damned,\r\n  than it would cost them to be saved; so your sex employ more\r\n  thought, memory and application to be fools, than would serve\r\n  to make them wise and useful. When I reflect on this I cannot\r\n  conceive you to be human creatures, but a certain sort of species\r\n  hardly a degree above a monkey; who has more diverting tricks\r\n  than any of you, is an animal less mischievious and expensive,\r\n  might in time be a tolerable critic in velvet and brocade, and,\r\n  for ought I know, would equally become them.... It is a little\r\n  hard that not one gentleman's daughter in a thousand should be\r\n  brought to read or understand her own natural tongue, or to be\r\n  judge of the easiest books that are written in it; as any one\r\n  may find, who can have the patience to hear them, when they are\r\n  disposed to mangle a play or novel, where the least word out of\r\n  the common road is sure to disconcert them; and it is no wonder\r\n  when they are not so much as taught to spell in their childhood,\r\n  nor can ever attain to it in their whole lives.... I know very\r\n  well that those who are commonly called learned women, have lost\r\n  all manner of credit by their impertinent talkativeness; but\r\n  there is an easy remedy for this, if you once consider, that\r\n  after all the pains you may be at, you never can arrive in point\r\n  of learning to the perfection of a school boy.[444]\r\n\r\nIn harmony with this low estimate of the attainments of women is\r\nSwift's famous aphorism, \"A very little wit is valued in a woman\r\nas we are pleased with a few words spoken plain by a parrot.\"[445]\r\nToo much emphasis could easily be given this utterance. It should\r\nbe remembered that it was not part of a well-considered theory. It\r\nwas merely one of the many unrelated sayings written down when Swift\r\nand Pope resolved to commit to paper all the maxims, epigrams, and\r\nshort reflections on life that they could think of in a day.[446] The\r\nphilosophy expressed counted for less than witty phrasing.\r\n\r\nSo, too, with Swift's brutal attacks on Mary Astell's college. It is\r\ngiven undue significance if it is interpreted simply as an attack on\r\nhigher education for women. His derision of the college was an angry\r\noutburst against a particular learned woman who had used her wit to\r\nmake fun of the Kit-Kat Club. It was Mary Astell the satirist rather\r\nthan Mary Astell the defender of learned women who awakened his\r\nspleen.[447]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Swift seems to have been favorably disposed towards\r\nwomen of genuine and unpretentious learning. His friendly services\r\nto the Irish poetesses, especially to Mrs. Barber and Mrs.\r\nPilkington, while rather condescending in tone, nowhere indicates\r\nany condemnation of their aspirations in the way of writing and\r\npublishing. In the \"Letter to a Very Young Lady\" he comments\r\nunfavorably on the women who spend their youth in exploiting their\r\nbeauty, and their later years in visits and cards, and says, \"Whereas\r\nI have known ladies at sixty, to whom all the polite part of court\r\nand town paid their addresses, without any further view than that\r\nof enjoying the pleasure of their conversation.\" And he advised the\r\nyoung wife to seek out good books and elevating conversation in order\r\nto raise herself above the general degrading level of her sex:\r\n\r\n  You must improve your mind by closely pursuing such a method of\r\n  study as I shall direct or approve of. You must get a collection\r\n  of history and travels, which I will recommend to you, and\r\n  spend some hours every day in reading them, and making extracts\r\n  from them if your memory be weak. You must invite persons of\r\n  knowledge and understanding to an acquaintance with you, by\r\n  whose conversation you will learn to correct your taste and\r\n  judgment.[448]\r\n\r\nMore convincing still is Swift's estimate of Stella. From her\r\nchildhood he had trained her mind and selected her reading, and we\r\nmust assume that he had formed her character and determined her\r\nacquirements according to the feminine model he most admired. When he\r\npraised her it was her intelligence on which he put emphasis. He said\r\nof her:\r\n\r\n  Never was any of her sex born with better gifts of mind, or\r\n  who more improved them by reading and conversation.... She was\r\n  well versed in the Greek and Roman story, and was not unskilled\r\n  in that of France and England. She spoke French perfectly,\r\n  but forgot much of it by neglect and sickness. She had read\r\n  carefully all the best books of travel, which served to open\r\n  and enlarge the mind. She understood the Platonic and Epicurean\r\n  philosophy, and judged very well of the defects of the latter.\r\n  She made very judicious abstracts of the best books she had\r\n  read. She understood the nature of government, and could point\r\n  out all the errors of Hobbes, both in that and in religion. She\r\n  had a good insight into physic, and knew somewhat of anatomy;\r\n  in both which she was instructed in her younger days by an\r\n  eminent physician, who had her long under his care, and bore the\r\n  highest esteem for her person and understanding. She had a true\r\n  taste of wit and good sense, both in poetry and prose, and was\r\n  a perfect good critic of style. Although her knowledge, from\r\n  books and company, was much more extensive than usually falls to\r\n  the share of her sex, yet she was so far from making a parade\r\n  of it, that her female visitants, on their first acquaintance,\r\n  who expected to discover it by what they call hard words and\r\n  deep discourse, would be sometimes disappointed, and say, \"They\r\n  found she was like other women.\" But wise men, through all her\r\n  modesty, whatever they discoursed on, could easily observe that\r\n  she understood them very well, by the judgment shown in her\r\n  observations, as well as in her questions.[449]\r\n\r\nSwift did not consider a woman as a slave or a toy. An alert mind,\r\na fund of varied information, an intelligent interest in books and\r\ngeneral affairs, seemed to him necessary qualifications in a woman\r\nwho would be a suitable companion for a man of sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexander Pope]\r\n\r\nPope was interested in questions of education and general learning.\r\nHis own training had not come through the regular channels of\r\npublic schools and university, so perhaps as an observer _ab extra_\r\nthe defects of the system were more apparent to him than to\r\nthose brought up in it. At any rate he protested against corporal\r\npunishment, against the monotony of a narrow and fixed curriculum,\r\nagainst vague metaphysics and dry-as-dust textual criticism. But in\r\nthis general discussion he did not touch upon the question of woman's\r\neducation. His attitude towards learned ladies was a personal one.\r\nWhen he was in love with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the luster of\r\nher \"heavenly mind,\" her learning, and her wisdom, were celebrated\r\nalong with the grace and beauty depicted by Kneller.[450] But when\r\nshe was no longer in favor she became \"that dang'rous thing, a female\r\nwit.\"[451] In _The Rape of the Lock_ he addressed the wayward goddess\r\nof the Cave of Spleen as:\r\n\r\n      Parent of vapors and of female wit,\r\n      Who give th' hysteric, or poetic fit,\r\n      On various tempers act by various ways,\r\n      Make some take physic, others scribble plays.[452]\r\n\r\nThe \"women-wits\" apparently protested against these lines, or at\r\nleast Lady Winchilsea did, and he responded with a conciliatory\r\n_Impromptu to Lady Winchilsea_, six lines of which are as follows:\r\n\r\n      In vain you boast Poetic Names of yore,\r\n      And cite those Sapphos we admire no more:\r\n      Fate doomed the Fall of every Female Wit;\r\n      But doomed it then, when first Ardelia writ.\r\n      Of all examples by the world confess'd,\r\n      I knew Ardelia could not quote the best.\r\n\r\nBut Pope is never as undisguisedly himself in eulogy as he is in\r\nsatire, and his real opinions probably came out when he and Gay and\r\nArbuthnot sat down to write a play which should adequately represent\r\ntheir separate and combined hostilities. The assignment to Pope of\r\nthe character of Phœbe Clinket, the authoress, shows not only his\r\nattitude towards Lady Winchilsea, but probably towards the tribe of\r\nwomen wits as well.[453] \"Most women have no characters at all\"[454]\r\nis Pope's general summary; and the highest compliment he could pay\r\nto Martha Blount, the woman for whom he cared most, was that she had\r\n\"Sense and Good Humour.\"[455] In any comparison with Stella, Martha\r\nBlount seems a very commonplace personage to rank as a poet's friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bishop Burnet]\r\n\r\nBishop Burnet opposed Mary Astell's plan for a college, and he\r\ndisliked any pushing into public affairs by women. \"I thought,\" he\r\nsaid, \"there were two sorts of persons that ought not to meddle in\r\naffairs, though upon very different accounts. These were churchmen\r\nand women. We ought to be above it, and women were below it.\" And\r\nwhen he first heard of Lady Margaret Kennedy, he was unwilling to\r\nmeet her because of her unfeminine interest in politics.\r\n\r\nYet Bishop Burnet was not absolutely opposed to the education\r\nof women. When he gave instructions as to the choice of a wife,\r\n\"a good understanding\" and \"a liberal education\" were among the\r\ncharacteristics to be sought. His objection to Mary Astell's plan was\r\ndue to his fear that a lay monastery such as she described might be\r\nhostile to the interests of the Church. He even advocated academies\r\ndevoted to \"women's education and religious retreat,\" and he thought\r\nthat \"monasteries without vows\" might be set on foot in such a\r\nfashion as to be \"the honor of a Queen on her throne.\"[456]\r\n\r\nHe also found especial pleasure in the society of educated women.\r\nWhen he finally met Lady Margaret Kennedy, he fell in love with her\r\nin spite of her politics. They were married in 1671, and when, after\r\nher death, he summed up her character, he put particular stress on\r\nher intellectual attainments. \"She was a woman,\" he wrote, \"of much\r\nknowledge, had read vastly; she understood both French, Italian\r\nand Spanish; she knew the old Roman and Greek authors well in the\r\ntranslations; she was an excellent historian and knew all our late\r\naffairs exactly well, and had many things in her to furnish out much\r\nconversation.\"[457]\r\n\r\nBishop Burnet's second wife was Mrs. Mary Scott, whom he married in\r\nHolland about 1687. In the _Life of Burnet_ it is said of her: \"With\r\nthese advantages of birth, she had those of a fine person; was well\r\nskilled in drawing, music, and painting; and spoke Dutch, English,\r\nand French equally well. Her knowledge in matters of divinity was\r\nsuch as might rather be expected from a student than from a lady. She\r\nhad a fine understanding and sweetness of temper, and excelled in all\r\nthe qualifications of a dutiful wife, a prudent mistress of a family,\r\nand a tender mother of children.\"[458]\r\n\r\nBishop Burnet's third wife has already been noted as a religious\r\nwriter. Her work was brought to completion and publication through\r\nhis encouragement and coöperation.\r\n\r\nHe also chose intellectual women as friends. He corresponded with\r\nMrs. Wharton, and wrote frequent poems to her, and said he \"rejoiced\r\nin her life and friendship beyond all things of this world.\" Nor did\r\nthe fact that she was an authoress disturb him. He even wrote verses\r\nin imitation of her verses.[459]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Dr. Burnet enjoyed the individual woman of alert\r\nintelligence and trained mind, but that he deprecated any but the\r\nmost carefully guarded schemes for a general extension of educational\r\nadvantages to women.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Wesley]\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley was always susceptible to the charms of women, but his\r\nlack of discrimination and insight in regard to them led to several\r\ndisastrous affairs of the heart, and finally, at forty-eight, to a\r\nmore disastrous marriage. These circumstances must be taken into\r\nconsideration in reading his various utterances on married life. In\r\na tract on _Marriage_ he wrote that the duties of a wife may all be\r\nreduced to two: 1. She must recognize herself as the inferior of her\r\nhusband. 2. She must behave as such. No such order of precedence had\r\nprevailed in the Epworth rectory, and the mother he almost worshiped\r\nwould have scorned such rules. They grew rather from his unhappy\r\nunion with the domineering, suspicious, obstinate Mrs. Vazeille. When\r\nhe wrote to her, \"Be content to be a private, insignificant person,\r\nknown and loved by God and me. Leave me to be governed by God and my\r\nown conscience. Then shall I govern you with gentle sway, and show\r\nthat I do indeed love you, even as Christ the Church\"; he was not so\r\nmuch expressing his idea of inevitable masculine authority, as he was\r\ntrying to calm one woman whose jealous frenzies destroyed his private\r\nhappiness and threatened to injure his work.[460]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John Duncomb: The Feminead (1751)]\r\n\r\nJohn Duncomb's _Feminead: or, Female Genius_, was written in 1751\r\nwhen he was but twenty-two. It is a tame and feeble production, but\r\nsince it antedates Mr. Ballard's _Memoirs_ and the _Eminent Ladies_,\r\nMr. Duncomb's glorification of female genius should have at least the\r\ncredit of being an original idea. And however halting the expression,\r\nhis poem embodied a genuine enthusiasm that puts it in line with\r\nthe newer ideas of the mid-eighteenth century. The list of learned\r\nladies presented is not a long one. Comedy writers and writers of\r\npersonal memoirs are sorrowfully and briefly dismissed as followers\r\nof a wanton muse. The virtuous ladies celebrated are led, of course,\r\nby the chaste Orinda. Those who succeed her are Lady Winchilsea, Mrs.\r\nCockburn, Mrs. Rowe, the Countess of Hertford, Viscountess Irwin,\r\nMrs. Wright, Mrs. Madan, Mrs. Leapor, Miss Carter, Mrs. Brooks, Miss\r\nFerrar, Miss Pennington, Miss Mulso, and Miss Highmore. Several of\r\nthese ladies find their only commemoration here. The Viscountess\r\nIrwin is deserving of \"a grateful tribute from all female hands\"\r\nbecause she rescued her sex's cause from the aspersions cast upon\r\nit by Mr. Pope in his _On the Characters of Women_. The poetical\r\nepistle of the Viscountess in rebuttal of his charges proved\r\nto be a true Ithuriel's spear, and disarmed the witlings. Miss\r\nPennington (afterwards Mrs. Peckard) wrote two odes on \"Cynthia\"\r\nand the \"Spring\" that appeared in Dodsley's _Collection_, volume V.\r\nMiss Pennington's _The Copper Farthing_, a burlesque imitation of\r\nPhilips's _Splendid Shilling_, was printed in Dilly's _Repository_,\r\nvolume I. She died in 1759, aged twenty-five. The others in the list\r\nare spoken of elsewhere in these pages, so need no further comment\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe poems open with an invocation to Richardson as \"The sex's\r\nfriend and constant patron.\" And there is a passage of national\r\ncongratulation over the freedom with which British nymphs wander in\r\nthe groves of Wisdom:\r\n\r\n      Ev'n now fond Fancy in our polish'd land\r\n      Assembled shews a blooming, studious band:\r\n      With various arts our reverence they engage,\r\n      Some turn the tuneful, some the moral page;\r\n      These led by Contemplation, soar on high,\r\n      And range the Heavens with philosophic eye;\r\n      While those surrounded by a vocal choir,\r\n      The canvas tinge, or touch the warbling lyre.\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Duncomb of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, was looking\r\nup his illustrations of female genius at the same time that Mr.\r\nBallard of Magdalen, Oxford, was getting his elaborate _Memoirs_\r\nready for the press. And each writer was apparently influenced in\r\nhis views by some specific woman scholar or writer whom he knew and\r\nadmired, and through whom he was led into a championship of the\r\ngeneral cause. As the learned Miss Elstob, and the pretty coin-loving\r\nsister, stimulated Mr. Ballard, so Susanna Highmore apparently\r\ngave direction to Mr. Duncomb's enthusiasm. He loved Miss Highmore\r\n(1730?-1812) through a protracted courtship of more than twelve\r\nyears. She is the \"Eugenia\" of his poem and is described as \"The\r\nMuse's pupil from her tenderest years.\" She was the daughter of\r\nJoseph Highmore, the artist. She belonged to the Richardson coterie\r\nand was one of the group to whom he read _Sir Charles Grandison_. Her\r\nsketch of the scene forms the frontispiece to the second volume of\r\nMrs. Barbauld's _Correspondence of Samuel Richardson_. Her _Fidelio\r\nand Honoria_ is the best known of her writings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: George Ballard: Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain]\r\n\r\nIn 1752 there was published at Oxford a significant book entitled\r\n_Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain, who have been Celebrated\r\nfor their Writings or Skill in the Learned Languages Arts and\r\nSciences_. The author of this book was George Ballard of whose\r\nobscure life but a few chance details have reached our day. This is\r\nthe more to be regretted since he was evidently a person of marked\r\nindividuality. He was born in Campden, Gloucestershire, in 1706.\r\nHis father was a poor man, and it was necessary for the children\r\nto be put early to work. Since George was sickly an easy trade was\r\nfound for him and he was apprenticed to a stay-maker, or woman's\r\nhabit-maker. His literary tastes were early apparent. At fourteen\r\nhe read Fox's _Acts and Monuments of the Church_, various books of\r\npolemical divinity, and a number of books against dissenters. He\r\nhad antiquarian tastes, and while still young began a collection of\r\ncoins. Our most definite picture of him is as a young man of twenty,\r\nstill a stay-maker, but already well known as an indefatigable\r\ncollector. In the summer of 1726 Mr. R. Graves wrote to Mr. Hearne as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  At Campden in Gloucestershire lives one Mr. Ballard, a Taylor,\r\n  who hath a Daughter, a very pretty Girl, of about fourteen Years\r\n  of Age, that hath an extraordinary Genius for Coins, & hath made\r\n  an odd Collection of them. Mr. Granger (who came from thence\r\n  last Night in his Return from London) saw her, and speaks much\r\n  of her, w^{ch} I took the more notice of because he is himself\r\n  a good Judge of Coins, & hath an admirable Collection of them,\r\n  especially of English ones. But, it seems, this young Girl is\r\n  chiefly delighted with those that are Roman.[461]\r\n\r\nIn February of the next year he wrote again:\r\n\r\n  The bearer is the young tailor of Campden who has collected so\r\n  many odd coins.... The young Man, whose name is George Ballard\r\n  has been all about the Country to pick up old money, and has got\r\n  a great Number.... When he has gott any new that I have not seen,\r\n  he brings 'em to me to tell him whose they are.... I suppose he\r\n  will bring some of them with him to shew you.[462]\r\n\r\nIn March Mr. Hearne recorded the visit of Mr. Ballard:\r\n\r\n  Yesterday, in the afternoon, called upon me Mr. George Ballard,\r\n  a young man (a Tayllour) of Campden in Gloucestershire, of whom\r\n  I have heard Mr. Graves speak more than once. This Ballard is an\r\n  ingenious, curious young man, & hath pickt up abundance of old\r\n  Coins, some of w^{ch} he shewed me. He hath been at many places\r\n  about the country for that End. He hath also pickt up many of our\r\n  Historians, & other English Books, & takes great delight in them,\r\n  but he is no scholar. He is a mighty admirer of John Fox & talks\r\n  mightily against the Roman Catholicks, tho' I told him, that\r\n  there are fifteen thousand Lyes in Fox, & brought him to some\r\n  sense of the Abuses frequently put upon the poor Catholicks.\r\n\r\n  He shewd me an old Ed. w^{ch} is the first of _Historia\r\n  Britannica_. Mr. Ballard told me, about a week ago he met with a\r\n  curious old Paint upon Board (an original, as he takes it) done\r\n  excellently well, of Queen Catharine, the divorced wife of Henry\r\n  VIII.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Ballard hath a sister (which Mr. Graves used to talk also of)\r\n  equally curious in Coins and Books with himself. He told me, she\r\n  is twenty-three years of Age.[463]\r\n\r\n  There came with Mr. Ballard, one Mr. Ellys, who deals in Laces\r\n  etc. and is Brother in law to Mr. Ballard, having married\r\n  another (one elder) Sister of Mr. Ballard's, by whom he hath 2\r\n  children.[464]\r\n\r\nIn May of the same year Mr. Hearne wrote:\r\n\r\n  Yesterday Mr. Graves of Mickleton called upon us. He told me,\r\n  that young Ballard the Taylor of Campden is out of his time, &\r\n  hath very good business at his trade, but that he is now learning\r\n  Latin, going twice a day for that end to the School-master\r\n  there, and that he hath a great mind to come and enter of [_sic_]\r\n  some College or Hall in Oxford, but Mr. Graves gives him no\r\n  encouragement, judging it better (& so I think too) to keep to\r\n  his Trade. This young Ballard's Great Uncle was a Doctor of\r\n  Physick. Mr. Graves hath promised to send me some account of\r\n  him.[465]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the contradictory statements as to the age of the\r\nattractive, coin-loving sister, there emerges from these letters a\r\nsufficiently definite picture of a household in which at least two\r\ntalented young people were carrying on researches in line with the\r\nbest antiquarian work of the day.\r\n\r\nWe are not told when Mr. Ballard took up Anglo-Saxon. The letters to\r\nand by Mr. Hearne when Ballard was twenty-one and twenty-two do not\r\nmention Anglo-Saxon as one of his interests. Six years later we find\r\nhim on intimate terms with Elizabeth Elstob whose Evesham School was\r\nbut a few miles from Campden. It does not seem improbable that Miss\r\nElstob introduced this promising young scholar to her own chosen\r\nfield of work. He was, at any rate, so impressed by the disproportion\r\nbetween her learning and her toil-bound life that he became her\r\nknight-errant and finally set in motion influences that resulted\r\nin her freedom. Whether Miss Elstob introduced him to Anglo-Saxon,\r\nor merely joined her ripe scholarship to his young enthusiasm,\r\ntheir common interest results in a warm friendship that found in\r\nAnglo-Saxon its firmest bond.\r\n\r\nWe have one interesting bit of testimony to the ardor with which\r\nMr. Ballard pursued the new language. He needed an Anglo-Saxon\r\ndictionary, but not being able to buy one he borrowed, from Mr.\r\nBrowne Willis, _Somner's Dictionary_, and made a very beautiful\r\ntranscript of it, with Thwaites's additions. This transcript was one\r\nof the manuscripts bequeathed by Mr. Ballard to the Bodleian. It was\r\na tremendous piece of work, and it is small wonder that Mr. Ballard\r\ncelebrated its completion by a \"festival.\"[466]\r\n\r\nThe advice given by Mr. Graves, that the ambitious young stay-maker\r\nshould \"keep to his trade,\" was perforce followed. Most of his life\r\nwas spent as a tailor at Campden, but in spite of this his fame for\r\nscholarship grew apace. In 1750 Lord Chedworth and the gentlemen of\r\nhis hunt, who annually in the hunting season spent about a month at\r\nCampden, heard of his attainments, and they offered him an annuity\r\nof £100 for life in order that he might prosecute his studies. He\r\ngratefully accepted £60 and set out at once for Oxford. He was made\r\none of the eight clerks of Magdalen College, receiving his rooms\r\nand commons free. His life at Oxford was but a continuation of his\r\nactivities at Campden. He had begun vast collections on various\r\nsubjects and these he pushed nearer to completion. At his death,\r\nhowever, which occurred in 1755 and was occasioned, it was thought,\r\nby too strenuous application to study, the only work he had published\r\nwas the _Memoirs_. He left to the Bodleian forty-four volumes of\r\nmanuscripts and original letters, including copies of some of his own\r\nwriting, and all carefully indexed.[467]\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the _Memoirs_ was well under way before he went\r\nto Oxford, for Mr. G. Russell wrote to him, May 15, 1759: \"The work\r\nyou are now engaged in, will I hope rescue us in a great measure from\r\nthe too just accusation our neglect in Biography has occasioned,\r\nand you have this additional satisfaction in prospect, that as the\r\nFair Sex are the subject, so they will be the Protectresses and\r\nGuardians of your performance. Their smiles, like a benign planet,\r\nwill gradually ripen it to perfection, and their breath embalm it\r\nto posterity.\"[468] The original manuscript of the _Memoirs_ was in\r\nthe possession of Mr. Gough and was sold with the rest of his books\r\nin 1811.[469] A copy of the first edition, in the Bodleian, contains\r\nmanuscript notes in the handwriting of the author.[470] A second but\r\ninferior edition came out in 1775.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Memoirs_ appeared in 1752, it attracted little attention.\r\nThe _Monthly Review_ for February, 1753, is not laudatory. The editor\r\nregrets that Mr. Ballard did not go farther back than the fourteenth\r\ncentury, that he has vainly spent his industry in rescuing from\r\noblivion some ladies who might better have been left there, and\r\nfinally that \"so extraordinary a genius and so excellent a woman as\r\nMrs. Cockburn, is wholly unnoticed in this work.\" Other criticisms\r\nreached Mr. Ballard from private sources. They were based almost\r\nentirely on religious and party lines. Mr. Ballard's answer to a\r\nletter from Dr. Lyttleton, Dean of Exeter, will sufficiently indicate\r\nthe tone of these criticisms. It was written May 22, 1753:\r\n\r\n  The day before I received your first epistle a Gent. of my\r\n  acquaintance brought me the _Monthly Review_ for February, that\r\n  I might see what the candid and genteel authors of that work had\r\n  said of mine. They observe to the publick, that _I have said_\r\n  C. Tishem was so skilled in the Greek tongue, that she could\r\n  read Galen in its original, which very few Physicians are able\r\n  to do. Whether this was done maliciously, in order to bring the\r\n  wrath of the Æsculapians upon me, or inadvertently, I cannot\r\n  say: but I may justly affirm, that they have used me very ill in\r\n  that affair; since if they had read with attention, which they\r\n  ought to have done before they attempted to give a character of\r\n  the Book, they must have known that the whole account of that\r\n  Lady (which is but one page) is not mine, but borrowed with\r\n  due acknowledgement from the _General Dictionary_. They are\r\n  likewise pleased to inform the world that I have been rather\r\n  too industrious in the undertaking, having introduced several\r\n  women who hardly deserved a place in the work. I did not do\r\n  this for want of materials; neither did I do it rashly, without\r\n  advising with others of superior judgment in those affairs, of\r\n  which number Mr. Professor Ward was one. But those pragmatical\r\n  Censors seem to have but little acquaintance with those studies,\r\n  or otherwise they might have observed that all our general\r\n  Biographers, as Leland, Bale, Pits, Wood, and Tanner, have\r\n  trod the very same steps; and have given an account of all the\r\n  authors they could meet with, good and bad, just as they found\r\n  them: and yet, I have never heard of any one that had courage or\r\n  ill-nature enough, to endeavour to expose them for it. While I\r\n  was ruminating on these affairs, three or four letters came to\r\n  my hands, and perceiving one of them come from my worthy friend\r\n  the Dean of Exeter, I eagerly broke it open, and was perfectly\r\n  astonished to find myself accused of _party zeal_ in my book; and\r\n  that from thence the most candid reader might conclude the author\r\n  to be both a Church and State Tory. But after having thoroughly\r\n  considered all the passages objected to, and not finding the\r\n  least tincture of either Whig or Tory principles contained in\r\n  them, I began to chear up my drooping spirits, in hopes that I\r\n  might possibly outlive my supposed crime; but, alas! to my still\r\n  greater confusion! when I opened my next letter from a Tory\r\n  acquaintance, I was like one thunderstruck at the contents of it.\r\n  He discharges his passionate but ill-grounded resentment upon me\r\n  most furiously. He tells me, he did not imagine Magdalen College\r\n  could have produced such a rank Whig. He reproaches me with want\r\n  of due esteem for the Stuart Family, to whom he says I have shown\r\n  a deadly hatred, and he gives me, as he imagines, three flagrant\r\n  instances of it. 1. That I have unseasonably and maliciously\r\n  printed a letter of Queen Elizabeth's, in order to blacken the\r\n  memory of Mary Queen of Scots, and that, too, at a time when her\r\n  character began to shine as bright as the Sun. 2dly. That I have\r\n  endeavoured to make her memory odious, by representing her as\r\n  wanting natural affection to her only son, in my note at p. 162,\r\n  where he says I have printed part of a Will, etc. And 3dly, tho'\r\n  she was cut off in such a barbarous and unprecedented manner,\r\n  yet she has fallen unlamented by me. I am likewise charged with\r\n  having an affection to Puritanism; the reasons for which are,\r\n  my giving the Life of a Puritan Bishop's Lady, which it seems\r\n  need not have been done by me, had I not had a particular regard\r\n  for her, since it had been done before by Goodwin who reprinted\r\n  her Devotions. And not content with this, I have blemished my\r\n  book with the memoirs of a Dissenting teacher's wife, and have\r\n  been kind enough to heighten even the character given her by her\r\n  indulgent husband; and that I am very fond of quoting Fox and\r\n  Burnet upon all occasions. These are thought strong indications\r\n  of the above-mentioned charge. It may be thought entirely\r\n  unnecessary to answer any of the objections from Exeter, after\r\n  having given you this Summary of my kind Friend's Candid Epistle;\r\n  but to you, Sir, to whom I could disclose the very secrets of my\r\n  soul, I will endeavour to say a word or two upon this subject,\r\n  and make you my Confessor upon this Occasion; and I will do it\r\n  with as much sincerity as if I lay on my death-bed. Before I was\r\n  fourteen years old, I read over Fox's Acts and Monuments of the\r\n  Church, and several of the best books of Polemical Divinity,\r\n  which strongly fortified me in the Protestant Religion; and gave\r\n  me the greatest abhorrence to Popery. And soon after I perused\r\n  Mercurius Rusticus, The Eleventh Persecution, Lloyd, Walker's\r\n  Sufferings of the Clergy, and many others, which gave me almost\r\n  as bad an opinion of the Dissenters. But then I learned in my\r\n  childhood _to live in Charity with all Men_, and I have used my\r\n  best endeavours to put this doctrine in practice all my life\r\n  long. I never thought ill, or quarrelled with any man merely\r\n  because he had been educated in principles different to mine;\r\n  and yet I have been acquainted with many papists, dissenters,\r\n  etc. and if I found any of them learned, ingenuous, and modest,\r\n  I always found my heart well-disposed for contracting a firm\r\n  friendship with them: and notwithstanding that, I dare believe\r\n  that all those people will, with joint consent, vouch for me,\r\n  that I have ever been steady in my own principles.\r\n\r\n  I can truly affirm that never any one engaged in such a work,\r\n  with an honester heart, or executed it with more unbiassed\r\n  integrity, than I have done. And indeed, I take the unkind\r\n  censures passed upon me by the furious uncharitable zealots of\r\n  both parties, to be the strongest proof of it. And after all, I\r\n  dare challenge any man, whether Protestant, Papist, or Dissenter,\r\n  Whig or Tory, (and I have drawn up and published memoirs of\r\n  women who professed all those principles) to prove me guilty\r\n  of partiality, or to shew that I have made any uncharitable\r\n  reflections on any person, and whenever that is done, I will\r\n  faithfully promise to make a public recantation. I wish, Sir,\r\n  you would point out to me any one unbecoming word or expression\r\n  which has fell from me on Bishop Burnet. Had I had the least\r\n  inclination to have lessened his character, I did not want proper\r\n  materials to have done it. I have in my possession two original\r\n  letters from Bishop Gibson and Mr. Norris of Bemerton, to Dr.\r\n  Charlett, which, if published, would lessen your too great esteem\r\n  for him. And what, I beseech you, Sir, have I said in praise of\r\n  Mrs. Hopton and her pious and useful labours, which they do not\r\n  well deserve, and which can possibly give any just offence to\r\n  any good man? I dare not censure or condemn a good thing merely\r\n  because it borders upon the Church of Rome. I rather rejoice that\r\n  she retains anything I can fairly approve. Should I attempt to do\r\n  this, might I not condemn the greater part of our Liturgy, etc.?\r\n  and should I not stand self-condemned for so doing? I cannot for\r\n  my life perceive that I have said anything of that excellent\r\n  woman, which she does not merit; and I must beg leave to say\r\n  that I think her letter to F. Turbeville deserves to be wrote in\r\n  letters of gold, and ought to be carefully read and preserved by\r\n  all Protestants. Mary Queen of Scots fell under my notice, no\r\n  otherwise than as a learned woman. The affairs you mention would\r\n  by no means suit my peaceable temper. I was too well acquainted\r\n  with the warm disputes, and fierce engagement both of domestic\r\n  and foreign writers on that head, once to touch upon the subject.\r\n  And indeed, unless I had been the happy discoverer of some secret\r\n  springs of action which would have given new information to the\r\n  public, it would have been excessive folly in me to intermeddle\r\n  in an affair of so tender a nature, and of so great importance.\r\n\r\n  I have often blamed my dear friend Mr. Brome for destroying his\r\n  valuable collections, but I now cease to wonder at it. He spent\r\n  his leisure hours pleasantly and inoffensively, and when old\r\n  age came on, which not only abates the thirst, but oftentimes\r\n  gives a disrelish to these and almost all other things, which do\r\n  not help to make our passage into eternity more easy, he then\r\n  destroyed them (I dare believe) in order to prevent the malicious\r\n  reflections of an ill-natured world.\r\n\r\n  I have always been a passionate lover of History and Antiquity,\r\n  Biography, and Northern Literature: and as I have ever hated\r\n  idleness, so I have in my time filled many hundred sheets with my\r\n  useless scribble, the greater part of which I will commit to the\r\n  flames shortly to prevent their giving me any uneasiness in my\r\n  last moments.[471]\r\n\r\nThe bitter feeling indicated by this letter, and the sense of\r\ndisappointment resulting from criticisms so unsympathetic, must have\r\nbeen considerably mitigated by the noble list of subscribers with\r\nwhich the book was ushered into the world.[472] That would indicate\r\nat least a financial success, and doubtless appreciation came from\r\nmany unrecorded sources.\r\n\r\nMr. Ballard's book is of interest if it were only as a _tour de\r\nforce_ in the way of collecting materials from scattered sources.\r\nHe sought far and wide for the facts he chronicles. All available\r\nbiographical dictionaries, general histories, county histories,\r\ngenealogical records, wills, funeral sermons, epitaphs, published\r\nworks, private manuscripts,--all became the subjects of his\r\nindefatigable inquiries. He sought interviews, he wrote letters, he\r\ncajoled information from the most unlikely recesses. And he had an\r\neye for picturesque and personal detail, so that out of his rapid and\r\noften disordered assemblage of facts it is possible to reconstruct,\r\nin many instances, a vivid impression of real women in their form and\r\nhabit as they lived. That closer scholarship should now and then find\r\ninaccuracies in his statements is no more than should be expected,\r\nand should in no degree invalidate his claim to recognition as having\r\ndone an invaluable piece of research in a biographical realm entirely\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nThe _Memoirs_ is a handsome volume of 474 pages and contains sixty\r\nmore or less extended biographies. Except for Queen Elizabeth the\r\nlongest notice is in the twenty-four pages devoted to Margaret\r\nRoper, and the accounts range from that down to eight or ten lines.\r\nThe order is approximately chronological. The lives are divided\r\ninto two portions with separate dedications. The first one reads,\r\n\"To Mrs. Talbot of Kineton in Warwickshire the Following Memoirs of\r\nLearned Ladies in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries are most\r\nhumbly inscribed as an acknowledgement of my sincere and high regard\r\nfor her and Mr. Talbot and as a small Testimony of Gratitude for\r\nExtraordinary Favours conferred by Both of Them upon their most\r\nobliged and most devoted humble servant George Ballard.\" The second\r\ndedication was, \"To Mrs. Delany the Truest Judge and Brightest\r\nPattern of all the Accomplishments which adorn her Sex these Memoirs\r\nof Learned Ladies in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries are\r\nmost humbly inscribed by her obedient servant George Ballard.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Preface Mr. Ballard comments on the value of biographical\r\nrecords and then proceeds to a justification of his own work:\r\n\r\n  The present age is so far from being defective in this respect,\r\n  that it hath produced a greater number of excellent biographers\r\n  than any preceding times: and yet, I know not how it hath\r\n  happened, that very many ingenious women of this nation, who\r\n  were really possessed of a great share of learning, and have, no\r\n  doubt, in their time been famous for it, are not only unknown to\r\n  the public in general, but have been passed by in silence by our\r\n  greatest biographers.\r\n\r\n  When it is considered how much has been done on this subject\r\n  by many learned foreigners, we may justly be surprized at this\r\n  neglect among the writers of this nation; more especially, as it\r\n  is pretty certain, that England hath produced more women famous\r\n  for literary accomplishments, than any other nation in Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Those, whose memoirs are here offered to the publick, I have\r\n  placed in the order of time in which they lived; omitting none,\r\n  of whom I could collect sufficient materials. For as there may\r\n  yet be some learned women of those times, whose characters I am\r\n  an entire stranger to; so there are others, whom I well know to\r\n  have been persons of distinguished parts and learning, but have\r\n  been able to collect very little else relating to them. Such as,\r\n  Lady Mary Nevil, Lady Anne Southwell, Lady Honor Hay, Lady Mary\r\n  Wroath, Lady Armyne, Lady Ranelagh, Lady Anne Boynton (famous\r\n  for her skill in ancient coins, and noble collection of them)\r\n  Lady Levet, Lady Warner, Gentlewomen; Mrs. Mabilla Vaughan, Mrs.\r\n  Elizabeth Grimstone, Mrs. Jane Owen, Mrs. M. Croft, Mrs. Aemillia\r\n  Sawyer, Mrs. Makins (who corresponded in the learned languages,\r\n  with Mrs. Anna Maria à Schurman), Mrs. Gertrude More, Mrs.\r\n  Dorothy Leigh, together with many other learned and ingenious\r\n  women, since the year 1700; of those latter I have had the good\r\n  fortune to make very considerable collections: and among the\r\n  former, I had drawn up an account of Mrs. Carew, in the same\r\n  manner with the other memoirs, but omitted printing it by mere\r\n  accident.\r\n\r\nThe motto on the title-page, \"_Et sane qui Sexum alterum ad studia\r\nidoneum negant, iam olim rejecti, fuere ab omnibus philosophis_,\"\r\nexpresses the spirit of the book. Mr. Ballard was perfectly genuine\r\nin his admiration of learned women. In his impressionable youth he\r\nhad found his sister as intelligent in collecting old coins and books\r\nas he himself. Later the most learned Anglo-Saxon scholar he knew\r\nwas Miss Elstob. His fervent recognition of his sister's genius,\r\nhis high sense of Miss Elstob's learning, are but a forecast of the\r\ndirection of his mature work. He had known two brilliant women,\r\nhence he had a belief in the possible intellectual achievements of\r\nwomen. He had seen one of these women, in spite of her constructive\r\nand advanced scholarship, consigned to poverty and oblivion, and a\r\nsense of injustice took possession of his mind. The championship\r\nof Miss Elstob passed over into championship of all learned women.\r\nHis _Memoirs_, he hopes, will remove \"that vulgar prejudice of the\r\nsupposed incapacity of the female sex.\" To accomplish this end he\r\nrelies in the main on a cool and unemphasized recital of facts. But\r\nnow and then he allows himself to protest against some especial\r\ninjustice. For instance, under the \"Memoirs of Mary Countess of\r\nPembroke,\" he says of her translation of the Psalms:\r\n\r\n  But then we are informed by Sir John Harington, and afterwards by\r\n  Mr. Wood, and from him by the late learned Dr. Thomas, that she\r\n  was assisted by Dr. Babington then chaplain to the family, and\r\n  afterwards Bishop of Worcester; for, say they, 't was more than\r\n  a woman's skill to express the sense of the Hebrew so right, as\r\n  she hath done in her verse; or more than the English or Latin\r\n  translation could give her. This argument has likewise been made\r\n  use of by a certain divine to divest another worthy Lady of the\r\n  honour of an excellent performance, in the composition of which\r\n  was shown some skill in that primitive language. But why this\r\n  should be thought a cogent argument to prove it, I am very much\r\n  at a loss to know; it being not so much as pretended, so far as\r\n  I can be informed, that there is more skill required, or greater\r\n  difficulties to be met with in acquiring that language, than\r\n  there is in attaining an exact knowledge in the Greek and other\r\n  tongues, which all the world knows numberless women have been\r\n  perfectly well versed in.\r\n\r\n  And that the female sex are as capable of learning this as any\r\n  other language, appears so plain from many undeniable instances\r\n  of it, as to render any farther disproof as to that assertion\r\n  unnecessary. Let those who doubt of it, read what St. Jerom has\r\n  recorded of the noble Lady Paula and her daughter Eustochium.\r\n  The Lady Paula's character he solemnly professes himself, and\r\n  that upon a most solemn occasion, to have drawn not in the way of\r\n  a Panegyric, but to have related everything with the strictest\r\n  veracity; and therefore will not, I hope, be suspected of\r\n  flattery, when he tells us that she, in her old age, did speedily\r\n  learn it; and understood the language so well as to speak it.\r\n\r\n  Or if this be referring them too far back to antiquity, let them\r\n  reflect on the extraordinary learning and abilities of Mrs. Anna\r\n  Maria à Schurman; who was not only well skilled in Greek and\r\n  Latin, but in the Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Chaldaic, etc. And we\r\n  are told [in Evelyn's _Numismata_] that Ludovisia Sarracennia, a\r\n  Physician's daughter of Lyons, understood and spoke Hebrew and\r\n  Greek at the age of eight years. To let pass many other foreign\r\n  examples, I shall only observe that our own Kingdom produced\r\n  several women in the last century, who were famous for their\r\n  skill in Hebrew, etc. Particularly a young lady of the North\r\n  family, who was well versed in the Oriental languages. Mrs. Bland\r\n  a Yorkshire gentlewoman was so well skilled in it, that she\r\n  taught it to her son and daughter. Likewise the late Mrs. Bury of\r\n  Bristol, and others, of whom I need say no more here, since they\r\n  will be remembered in this catalogue.\r\n\r\nAgain, under \"Lady Pakington,\" the question of Hebrew comes up. One\r\ngentleman has told him that _The Whole Duty of Man_ and the other\r\ntreatises by the same author could not be by a woman because they\r\nwere too deeply learned, and another gentleman wrote that the \"many\r\nquotations from Hebrew writers\" precluded female authorship. But Mr.\r\nBallard answers:\r\n\r\n  And since skill in the Hebrew language is made use of as a\r\n  convincing argument (tho, for my part, I can not find one Hebrew\r\n  quotation in the whole book) he may please to understand, that\r\n  besides the justly celebrated Mrs. Anna Maria à Schurman, and\r\n  many other foreign ladies, we have had several domestic examples\r\n  of _Women_ who have been famed for their skill in that primitive\r\n  language, viz., Lady Jane Gray, Lady Killigrew, a Lady of the\r\n  Nottingham family, another Lady of the North family, Lady\r\n  Ranelagh, Mrs. Bury, and Mrs. Elizabeth Bland of Beeston in\r\n  Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poems by Eminent Ladies (1755)]\r\n\r\nThe success of Mr. Ballard's _Memoirs_ in 1752 led to the production\r\nin 1755 of _Poems by Eminent Ladies_, \"Printed for R. Baldwin, at the\r\nRose, in Pater-Noster-Row.\"[473] The brief Preface reads in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  These volumes are perhaps the most solid compliment that can\r\n  possibly be paid to the Fair Sex. They are a standing proof that\r\n  great abilities are not confined to the men, and that genius\r\n  often glows with equal warmth, and perhaps with more delicacy,\r\n  in the breast of a female. The Ladies, whose pieces we have here\r\n  collected, are not only an honour to their sex, but to their\r\n  native country; and there can be no doubt of their appearing to\r\n  advantage together, when they have each severally been approved\r\n  by the greatest writers of their times. It is indeed a remarkable\r\n  circumstance, that there is scarce one Lady, who has contributed\r\n  to fill these volumes, who was not celebrated by her contemporary\r\n  poets, and that most of them have been particularly distinguished\r\n  by the most lavish encomiums either from _Cowley_, _Dryden_,\r\n  _Roscommon_, _Creech_, _Pope_, or _Swift_.\r\n\r\n  There is indeed no good reason to be assigned why the poetical\r\n  attempts of females should not be well received, unless it can\r\n  be demonstrated that fancy and judgment are wholly confined\r\n  to one half of our species; a notion, to which the readers of\r\n  these volumes will not readily assent. It will not be thought\r\n  partiality to say that the reader will here meet with many pieces\r\n  on a great variety of subjects excellent in their way; and that\r\n  this collection is not inferior to any miscellany compiled from\r\n  the works of men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The short accounts of the several writers, prefixed to each of\r\n  their poems, were compiled from the best materials we could meet\r\n  with. The life of Mrs. _Behn_ in particular, (which is very\r\n  entertaining) is extracted from _The Lives of the Poets_, by Mr.\r\n  Theophilus Cibber and others. For many of the rest we are obliged\r\n  to Mr. _Ballard's_ entertaining Memoirs of Learned Ladies.\r\n\r\nThe two unimpressive volumes of this publication make rather more\r\ninteresting reading than most miscellanies, but there is no hint\r\nof latent genius. The ladies are merely clever versifiers. They\r\nmanage the heroic couplet with the mechanical skill of Pope's lesser\r\nimitators. Their verses jingle in the close with sufficient accuracy.\r\nPope's antitheses and balanced structures, his oratorical figures,\r\nhis use of pungent personal portraiture, are characteristics that\r\nfind many enfeebled echoes. In subject-matter and general tone the\r\nbooks present an impeccable front. The authors would be sure to\r\nprefer Steele's _Ladies' Library_ to Mrs. Pilkington's _Love in\r\nExcess_, yet they are not conspicuously strait-laced. The poems are\r\nnearly all occasional and gain thus a note of reality, and, though\r\nno lady attains to genuine humor or actual lightness of touch, there\r\nare evidences of a brightness of spirit, a vivacity, a quickness\r\nof repartee, that remove the poems from the realm of the purely\r\nimitative and conventional.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain (1755)]\r\n\r\nAmong the literary curiosities of the eighteenth century are two\r\nbooks by Thomas Amory. One of these, _Memoirs of Several Ladies of\r\nGreat Britain_, appeared in 1755 in two volumes. The first volume of\r\nthe second work, _The Life of John Buncle_, was published in 1756,\r\nand a second volume appeared in 1766. When he began the _Memoirs_\r\nhe had planned to extend the series to eight volumes, but he did\r\nnot carry it beyond the second volume of _John Buncle_. The full\r\ntitle of the _Memoirs_[474] indicates its character as a medley of\r\nunrelated observations, disquisitions, and opinions. _John Buncle_\r\nhas a less erratic plan, some order being given by the fact that\r\nthe hero engages in seven successive matrimonial ventures in the\r\ncourse of his travels through Yorkshire and the Lake District. But\r\nthe books are alike in aim, both being an exposition of Christian\r\nDeism. John Buncle's wives are all either able advocates of\r\nSocinianism when he meets them, or they have minds so attempered\r\nthat on hearing the tenets of that faith they ardently embrace it.\r\nThe ladies in both books are introduced with a Defoe-like apparatus\r\nof seemingly accurate details as to dates, locations, and particular\r\ncircumstances. Although these ladies have had a great variety of\r\nromantic adventures and differ somewhat as to wealth and social\r\nposition, they are essentially alike in character and function, the\r\none purpose of the author being through them to exemplify and explain\r\nhis religious beliefs. The interesting point is that Mr. Amory in\r\ncreating ideal and learned defenders of his views should have chosen\r\nyoung ladies. And this was deliberately done. He states it as his\r\nconviction \"that the faculties and imagination of women's minds\r\nproperly cultivated may equal those of the greatest men,\" and he\r\nadvocates a higher education for young women of sufficient fortune:\r\n\"It would be so far from making them those ridiculous mortals\r\nMolière has described under the character of learned ladies; that it\r\nwould render them more agreeable and useful, and enable them by the\r\nacquisition of true sense and knowledge, to be superior to gayety,\r\ndress and dissipation. They would be glorious creatures then. Every\r\nfamily would be happy.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view his young ladies in the _Memoirs_ and\r\n_John Buncle_ have not only virtue, wealth, and beauty, but learning\r\nof the most specialized and difficult sort. One girl of twenty had\r\nbeen for five years studying under the tutelage of a Scotchman\r\nand had attained great proficiency in \"arithmetic, Algebra, and\r\nfluxions.\" On her first interview with the author she discoursed for\r\nten uninterrupted pages on the method of fluxions and so wrought\r\nupon her hearer's admiration that \"for a full quarter of an hour\r\nafter she ceased he sat looking at her in the greatest astonishment.\"\r\nBut he recovered sufficiently to secure the mathematical prodigy as\r\nhis fourth wife. Another \"master in the fluxionary way\" was a Mrs.\r\nBenslow, and most of the ladies found a perennial source of joy in\r\nalgebra and arithmetic. But the realm in which their minds luxuriated\r\nwas that of speculative theology. They read books on religious\r\nfaiths, ancient and modern, they discussed the most abstruse problems\r\nof metaphysics, and they carried ethical problems into the most\r\nattenuated ramifications.\r\n\r\nThe lady who seems to be in all ways Mr. Amory's ideal is Miss\r\nHarriot Eusebia Harcourt. She appears in both books, and in\r\ndefiniteness of personality is superior to any of the other\r\ncharacters. It is not impossible that Amory gives under her name\r\na highly idealized portrait of some one he knew. The _Biographium\r\nFemineum_, published in 1766, was so impressed by Miss Harcourt as\r\nto catalogue her among distinguished Englishwomen, but the entire\r\naccount seems to be based on Amory's characterization. She is also\r\nadmitted as a real person in _Female Biography_, by Miss Mary Hays,\r\nin 1803, and in Rose's _New Biographical Dictionary_, in 1839. But\r\nMiss Harcourt is almost certainly a fictitious character. If any\r\nwoman had really accomplished what is described in Amory's books, it\r\nis incredible that there should have been no contemporary notice of\r\nso novel an experiment.[475]\r\n\r\nAccording to Amory, Miss Harcourt was born in 1705. She received a\r\nlearned education supplemented by nine years of travel in Europe with\r\nher father who secured for her the best masters in the languages\r\nof the different countries, so that she became an accomplished\r\nlinguist. On the death of her father in 1733 she inherited a large\r\nfortune which she was free to spend according to her own ideas.\r\nHer acquaintanceship with noble nuns in various parts of Europe\r\nhad convinced her that a life similar to theirs, but outside the\r\nCatholic Church, would be ideal. She thereupon returned to England\r\nand with eleven like-minded ladies she organized a society of\r\n\"Reformed Recluses.\" On her estate in Richmondshire she built a\r\nbeautiful cloister as a winter residence. In the summer the Society\r\noccupied a charming villa on the Green Island, a part of her father's\r\nproperty in the western islands of Scotland. Amory says that he was\r\nshipwrecked on this island and that during his long stay there he\r\nbecame intimately acquainted with the details of Miss Harcourt's\r\nscheme of life. On so agreeable a theme he allowed his imagination\r\nfree rein. The magnificent situation of the Green Island gave full\r\nscope for descriptions of wild and romantic scenery.[476] For the\r\nthings wrought by the hand of man in the grounds about the villa,\r\nhe had but to take hints from some of the great English gardens,\r\nnotably that at Stowe. The Elysium, the marble busts, the Rotunda,\r\nat Stowe, were almost certainly the original of his Elysian Fields,\r\ngroups of marble statues, and Orbicular Building. And as these\r\nexternal details stimulated his fancy to the production of an\r\nAladdin-like garden, so such suggestions as those of Mary Ward's\r\n\"Institute,\" or especially Mary Astell's \"Protestant Nunnery,\"\r\nstimulated his active mind into working out the details of such a\r\nplan. He described not only the constitution of such a society, its\r\nfinancial status, and its general aims, but he went into all the\r\nminutiæ of dress, meals, social customs, diversions, occupations. The\r\nladies paid £500 on entrance, they took no vows of celibacy, they had\r\nno prioress, they lived well, they had abundant service, they dressed\r\nrichly. The badge of their order was a large diamond cross. No one\r\nwas admitted who had not a taste for music. Musical composition,\r\nplaying on different instruments, singing, painting, and drawing\r\nwere the elegant diversions. There was a large and well-selected\r\nlibrary, and the ladies made researches according to their taste,\r\nwith the proviso that once a week they must read to the rest the\r\nresult of their labors--a sort of multifarious and inchoate seminar.\r\nThe approved papers were recorded in a club book called _Didaskalia_.\r\nThese ladies being Christian deists and having minds unclouded by\r\nthe mists of superstition, enthusiasm, and atheism, spent much time\r\nin rational devotion. Mr. Amory becomes ecstatic as the picture of\r\nthis ideal society grows under his hand and finally declares that\r\nif he were a woman of fortune he would at once seek out this happy\r\nsociety of religious recluses with a certainty that no other life on\r\nthe globe could offer such felicity. He approves of Miss Harcourt's\r\nlast act which was to will her large fortune as an endowment for this\r\ncloistral house. A fanciful dream, but one that constantly brings\r\nto mind Tennyson's _Princess_. Only to Amory's Green Island there\r\ncame no disrupting influences of love and childhood. He left his\r\nladies still enjoying their learned seclusion, and filling volume\r\nafter volume of the _Didaskalia_, painting great pictures, producing\r\noriginal oratorios, making abstruse speculations, and serving God\r\nwith calm hearts.[477]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSATIRIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THE LEARNED LADY IN COMEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe artificial comedy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in\r\nEngland is of genuine significance as a social document. Its purpose\r\nwas to hold up to ridicule whatever in contemporary life, especially\r\nthe life of the every-day middle-class world, could be counted\r\nfoolish or absurd. In its pages nearly every phase of ordinary\r\nhuman activity could look upon its more or less distorted image,\r\nand the taste and temper of the times are pretty fairly measured\r\nby the personages accepted by dramatists, actors, and audiences as\r\nlegitimate sources of comic appeal.\r\n\r\nLiterature offered a surprisingly rich field to the writers of\r\ncomedy. Tragedies and comedies, the new Italian opera, farces,\r\npantomimes, harlequinades, pastoral dramas, were parodied,\r\nburlesqued, and criticized on the stage. Individual authors,\r\ntheater-managers, actors, and actresses, were ever-recurring figures\r\nin the popular comedy. Quite a little library might, for instance, be\r\ngathered of the satiric representations of Colley Cibber, Theophilus\r\nCibber, and Susanna Maria Cibber.\r\n\r\nOther popular comic types were heroes and heroines marked by national\r\ncharacteristics. An illuminating social study might be made of the\r\nIrishman in comedy, the many ancestors of Sheridan's \"Sir Lucius\r\nO'Trigger,\" as \"Sir Teague O'Divelly,\" \"Sir Calligan O'Bralligan,\"\r\n\"Mr. O'Connor MacCormack,\" \"Major O'Flaherty,\" and the rest of the\r\ntruculent, honey-tongued, generous, blundering tribe. There are stage\r\nScotchmen and Welshmen represented by \"Sir Pertinax MacSycophant,\"\r\n\"Mr. Apreece,\" and their congeners. The Frenchman as valet,\r\nmusic-master, dancing-master, and villain-in-ordinary to the heroes\r\nis ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nOr we might study the professions. Physicians line up on the stage\r\nas quacks, charlatans, conscious impostors. Lawyers are pictured as\r\nmen whose sole purpose is to hide ignorance and knavery in a cloud\r\nof words, and to empty the pockets of their clients in a trumped-up\r\npursuit of justice.\r\n\r\nThe Church does not escape. The Puritan who in Restoration drama\r\nwas represented as a psalm-singing, whining, long-faced hypocrite,\r\nconcealing a vicious life under a pretense of rigid sanctity, was\r\nreplaced as a comic type in the early eighteenth century by the\r\nnon-juror, and when later Wesley's tabernacle and Foote's play-house\r\nwere competing for popular favor, it was the Methodist who obtained\r\nthe bright reversion, there being ascribed to him all the cant and\r\nhypocrisy of his forbears.\r\n\r\nSociety is likewise represented in all its follies and vices. Of\r\ngenuine social importance is a study of the long line of \"fops,\"\r\n\"coxcombs,\" \"pretty fellows,\" \"beaux,\" \"macaronies,\" \"dudes,\" as they\r\nwere variously called, from \"Sir Solomon, the Cautious Coxcomb,\" in\r\n1669, through \"Sir Fopling Flutter,\" \"Sir Courtly Nice,\" \"Sir Novelty\r\nFashion,\" \"Lord Foppington,\" \"Sir William Mode,\" \"Mr. Apeall,\" \"Sir\r\nBrilliant Fashion,\" \"Lord Trinket,\" \"Brisk,\" \"Flutter,\" \"Sparkish,\"\r\nand the rest of the inane tribe, with their laces and frills, their\r\npowdered wigs, their enameled snuff-boxes, their ivory combs and\r\npocket-mirrors, their muffs and canes, their inordinate vanity,\r\naffectation, and empty-headedness.\r\n\r\nLearning, too, found its place on the stage. From the establishment\r\nof the Royal Society in 1662, the work of the Gresham professors was\r\nthe theme of unbridled ridicule. The virtuoso who spent his whole\r\ntime with a telescope investigating the geography of the moon or\r\nwith a microscope determining the nature of the bloom on a plum; the\r\nanatomist, the geologist, the antiquarian, were counted fair game for\r\nthe satirist.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE LEARNED LADY AS A COMIC TYPE\r\n\r\nIn this multifarious activity of the comic spirit it would be strange\r\nif any pretense to learning on the part of women should escape.\r\nAnd we are, in fact, presented with a motley procession of mock\r\nMinervas. Even as early as Jonson there was some recognition of the\r\ncomic potentialities of the learned lady as a type. In _Epicœne_\r\n(1609) Morose is warned against matrimony by Truewit who recounts\r\nthe ways in which a learned wife could shatter his peace. Proud to\r\nshow her Latin and Greek, she might talk all day like a parrot; or,\r\ncunning in controversy, she might attack the very knots of divinity;\r\nor, considering herself a critic, she might \"censure _poets_, and\r\nauthors, and stiles, and compare 'hem, DANIEL with SPENSER, IONSON\r\nwith tother youth, and so foorth.\"[478] But this summary seems to be\r\nless a reflection of contemporary life than an echo from Juvenal's\r\nSixth Satire.[479] More bitterly satirical is Jonson's representation\r\nof the \"Collegiate Ladies,\" \"an order between courtiers and\r\ncountry madams, that live from their husbands.\" But these ladies\r\nmake no pretense to learning. Lady Haughty and her coadjutors are\r\nfrivolous, affected, profligate women whose \"college-grammar\" and\r\n\"college-honours\"[480] have no significance beyond the amorous\r\nintrigue for which their order was founded. The play reads as if\r\nthere had been some contemporary organization at which Jonson's\r\nsatire was directed, but no record of such an organization is extant.\r\nAt any rate, the satire was against women who considered themselves\r\nemancipated from conjugal life, rather than against learned women\r\nas such. In _The Devil is an Ass_ (1616) Jonson brings into some\r\nprominence \"a Lady Projectress\" who is said to deserve the gratitude\r\nof the commonwealth of ladies for her great undertakings in their\r\nbehalf. But her solid service is in the realm of Spanish fashions and\r\nnew cosmetics.\r\n\r\nJasper Mayne, in _The City Match_ (1639), has a fling at the \"new\r\nfoundation\" and \"the philosophical Madams\" in a manner even more\r\ncontemptuous than that of Jonson. He also presents a Mrs. Scruple,\r\na Puritan school-mistress learned in religious lore, who can\r\nexpound the Scriptures, who \"works Hebrew samplers and teaches to\r\nknit in Chaldee.\" Her pupil Dorcas makes \"religious petticoats,\"\r\nsubstituting church histories for flowers, and sanctifying cushionets\r\nand smock-sleeves with holy embroideries. But it seems to be the\r\nreligious zeal that is here satirized, with only an incidental\r\nreflection on the learning implied in a knowledge of Hebrew and\r\nChaldee.\r\n\r\nThese remote hints did not result in the establishment of a stage\r\ntype. It was through Molière that the learned lady took her place\r\nin English comedy. The immediate object of Molière's attack was the\r\ncoterie of the Hôtel de Rambouillet, a salon established about 1615.\r\nThe avowed purposes of this exclusive literary circle were to rid\r\nthe French tongue of impurities, to cultivate _le beau_ and _le vrai\r\nbel amour_ and _bel conversation_. They had a vocabulary peculiar to\r\nthemselves, and they devulgarized French by calling common things by\r\nuncommon names. They improvised stories and rhymes, played literary\r\ngames, called themselves by _noms de Parnasse_, and held exalted\r\nviews on friendship, love, and marriage, which they endlessly\r\ndiscussed. In the time of its greatest power some of the most noted\r\nmen and women of France belonged to this salon, but gradually\r\npedantry and affectation had crept in, and the extravagances of the\r\nlater _Précieux_ and _Précieuses_ in thought, speech, and manners\r\nawakened the ridicule of Molière. In his Preface to _Les Précieuses_\r\n(1659) he protested that the true _Précieuses_ could not rightly be\r\nvexed at a satire meant only for those absurd people who wretchedly\r\nimitated them. But it is nevertheless apparent that his play was an\r\nattack on the whole assembly of learned or pseudo-learned ladies and\r\ngentlemen who made up the salon, with particular attention to the\r\nladies. In this play he satirized especially _bel amour_, poetic\r\nimprovisation, and fine language.\r\n\r\nThirteen years later he returned to the general subject in a\r\nmore elaborate play, _Les Femmes Savantes_ (1672), where, in the\r\ncharacters of Armande, Bélise, and Philaminte, he represented the\r\nfalse delicacy of the learned ladies, the absurdities of their\r\nstruggle for pure diction, their puerile literary enthusiasms, their\r\naffected interest in science and philosophy, their neglect of all\r\nthe ordinary duties of life, and the essential hypocrisy of their\r\nprofessedly platonic attitude towards husbands and lovers.\r\n\r\nMolière's plays were well known to the earliest English playwrights\r\nof the Restoration.[481] Etherege had seen _Les Précieuses_[482]\r\non the French stage, and the impression it had made upon him was\r\nevidenced by his Sir Fopling Flutter, a brilliant English version\r\nof Molière's Mascarille, but Etherege nowhere takes up the ideas\r\nrepresented by Madelon and Cathos. Wycherley had personally known\r\nthe circle of the Hôtel de Rambouillet during his stay in France\r\nfrom 1655 to 1660,[483] and he could not have failed to know of\r\nthe sensation created by Molière's attack on the noted salon. And\r\nthroughout his work he was profoundly influenced by Molière in his\r\ngeneral conception of true comic material and methods. But apparently\r\nthe learned-lady theme did not appeal to him as especially suitable\r\nfor English treatment. Or possibly the very fact of his close\r\nassociation with some of the most brilliant members of the salon made\r\nhim averse to a satiric representation even of their absurdities.\r\n\r\nThe first comedy to show any direct influence of Madelon and Cathos\r\nis Dryden's _Mock Astrologer_ (1668).[484] Donna Aurelia is like\r\nher ancestors in _Les Précieuses_ in her attempts at fine language.\r\nShe is unable \"to speak ten words without some affected phrase that\r\nis in fashion.\" In direct imitation of the French damsels she calls\r\nher looking-glass \"the counsellor of the graces,\" and urges upon her\r\nmaid fashionable language and pronunciation. In her effort to secure\r\nstriking phraseology she does not rise above the constant use of\r\n\"furious.\" She has a \"furious inclination\" for the occult sciences,\r\na \"furious tender\" for Don Melchor, and a ghost is a \"furiously\r\nfurious\" appearance. Her indigence of epithets puts her far behind\r\nMolière's nimble-tongued young ladies, but she certainly strives to\r\nbe in the same class.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Molière became more apparent after the presentation\r\nof _Les Femmes Savantes_ in 1672. In Dryden's _Marriage à la Mode_\r\n(1672) is a really vital and entertaining picture of a lady with a\r\nliterary fad. Melantha is one of the sprightliest and most convincing\r\nof the comedy heroines before Congreve's Millamant. Melantha is a\r\nSicilian town lady, young, fair, and rich; a finished coquette,\r\nan inveterate news-monger, a hanger-on of the court. She would,\r\nshe says, rather be \"_mal traitée_ at court than deified in the\r\ntown.\" She accordingly overdoes what she considers to be court\r\ncharacteristics. Especially does she ape the French. French dances\r\nand clothes, French plays and ballets, French words, all that's\r\nwrit in France, fill her with rapture. Her lover does not win her\r\nby his face or fortune, but by his rapid fire of French terms.\r\nMelantha belongs to the cult of the _précieuses_ in her joy over fine\r\nlanguage. An Indian gown, a gimp petticoat, a new point gorget, are\r\ntossed to her maid Philatio as a reward for any new words she may\r\nbring in. Melantha counts it an ignominy to use vulgar, threadbare\r\nwords that are fit for nothing but to be thrown to peasants. She\r\npractices her vocabulary with her glances at the mirror, and makes\r\nup effective sentences into which she may run new acquisitions such\r\nas _naïveté_, _sottises_, _embarrass_, and is most unhappy when they\r\nprove recalcitrant and are lost in the rapid interplay of talk.\r\n\r\nMelantha is an admirable example of social satire, a delightfully\r\naudacious representation of a contemporary folly. France was\r\nthe recognized home of culture and good-breeding. No courtier\r\nor fashionable lady could be counted as having the last word in\r\nrefinement who had not spent some time on French soil, and the\r\nFrench language was one of the most important studies of the higher\r\nclasses in England. What was taken for granted in court circles\r\nbecame, of course, the _ne plus ultra_ of the ambitious town lady.\r\nBut her hastily acquired and imperfect knowledge would lead to\r\nmistakes and over-emphasis, the result being a character of genuinely\r\ncomic import. For the stage interpretation of Melantha actresses\r\ndoubtless had many a social model among the town ladies with violent\r\ncourt aspirations. Cibber says that Melantha was \"as finish'd an\r\nImpertinent as ever flutter'd in a Drawing-Room,\" and that she\r\ncontained \"the most compleat System of Female Foppery that could\r\npossibly be crowded into the tortured Form of a Fine Lady.\" And chief\r\namong her fopperies was her preciosity, a characteristic marked in\r\nmost of the learned ladies represented in seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncentury comedy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Behn's _Sir Patient Fancy_ came out late in 1678 and was based\r\nfor its chief intrigue on Molière's _Le Malade Imaginaire_ which had\r\nappeared in 1673. But the character of Lady Knowell, \"an affected\r\nlearned woman,\" reverted to _Les Femmes Savantes_. She is the young\r\nstepmother of Lord Knowell's marriageable son and daughter and is\r\nof considerable importance in the general movement of the play, but\r\nher real function is to present a caricature of a learned lady. She\r\nunderstands Greek, Latin, and Italian. She cannot endure \"divine\r\nHomer\" in a translation: \"_Ton d'apamibominous prosiphe podas ochus\r\nAchilleus!_ Ah how it sounds! which English't dwindles into the most\r\ngrating stuff:--Then the swift-footed _Achilles_ made reply.\" As\r\nshe looks upon the frivolous young girls of the play she exclaims:\r\n\"I'm for the substantial pleasure of an Author. _Philosophemur!_ is\r\nmy Motto.... Oh the delight of Books! When I was their age I always\r\nemployed my looser Hours in reading--if serious, 't was _Tacitus_,\r\n_Seneca_, _Plutarch's Morals_, or some such useful Author; or in an\r\nHumour gay, I was for Poetry, _Virgil_, _Homer_, or _Tasso_.\"\r\n\r\nTo this emphasis on the classics is added a preciosity which consists\r\nof misdirected attempts to use impressive language. Lady Knowell is\r\nan early and not very amusing Mrs. Malaprop. Her \"hard words\" are\r\nsometimes legitimate words to which she attaches a wrong meaning,\r\nas in the sentence, \"There is much Volubility in Human Affairs,\"\r\nwhen she means \"variability.\" But most of her words are compounded\r\nof portions of others each one of which contains some shade of\r\nher meaning; as, \"Were I querimonious [querulous, acrimonious] I\r\nshould resent the affront\"; \"Notwithstanding your Exprobations\r\n[expostulations, disapprobations]\"; and \"I saw your Reclination\r\n[revolt, declination] from my Addresses.\" These bungling attempts to\r\nplay with language are too far-sought, too puzzling, to bring instant\r\nlaughter, but they suffice to establish Lady Knowell as at least a\r\nwould-be precursor of Mrs. Malaprop a century later.\r\n\r\nThe young ladies make sport of Lady Knowell. Lucretia does not\r\napprove of her learning. \"Methinks,\" she says, \"to be read in the\r\nArts, as they call 'em, is the peculiar Province of the other Sex.\"\r\nIsabella is of much the same opinion, yet she feels that women might\r\neasily surpass most University men: \"Indeed the Men ... boast their\r\nLearning and Languages; but if they can find any one of our Sex\r\nfuller of Words, and to so little Purpose as some of their Gownmen,\r\nI'll be content to change my Petticoats for Pantaloons and go to a\r\nGrammar-school.\"\r\n\r\nIn Shadwell's _Sullen Lovers_ (1669) is a Lady Vaine who calls\r\nherself a \"Virtuosa\" and is learned in medicaments. She boasts of\r\nher serviceableness with her \"_Flos Unguentorum, Paracelsian_, and\r\n_Green-salve_,\" and praises the _Album Grecum_ as a salve of her own\r\nconcoction.\r\n\r\nOf much more interest is Shadwell's _Bury-Fair_ (1689). The chief\r\ncharacters are Lady Fantast, Mrs. Fantast, and Lady Fantast's\r\nstepdaughter, Gertrude Oldwit, and their attendant cavaliers. The\r\ncentral action, the joke played on the Fantast ladies in imposing\r\non them a barber dressed up to impersonate a French count, is taken\r\nfrom _Les Précieuses_. But Lady Fantast and her daughter have their\r\ndirect ancestry in Philaminte and Armande in _Les Femmes Savantes_.\r\nWildish who had at first loved Mrs. Fantast, but, on finding her a\r\n_précieuse_, had transferred his affections to Gertrude, is Molière's\r\nClitandre, while Gertrude herself and Mr. Oldwit are the Henriette\r\nand Chrysale of the French play. The common sense of the play is\r\nembodied in Wildish, Gertrude, and Mr. Oldwit. Lady Fantast is not\r\nherself especially learned, but all her ambitions in that line\r\nhave been concentrated on her daughter. \"I have bred my daughter a\r\nlinguist,\" she proudly exclaims when the young lady quotes Latin. The\r\ntwo ladies converse as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ To all that, which the World calls Wit and Breeding,\r\n  I have always had a natural Tendency, a _penchen_, deriv'd, as\r\n  the Learned say, _Ex traduce_, from your Ladyship: Besides the\r\n  great Prevalence of your Ladyship's most shining Example has\r\n  perpetually Stimulated me, to the Sacrificing all my Endeavours\r\n  towards the attaining of those inestimable Jewels; than which,\r\n  nothing in the Universe can be so much a _mon gre_, as the\r\n  _French_ say. And for Beauty, Madam, the Stock I am enrich'd\r\n  with, comes by emanation from your Ladyship; who has been long\r\n  held a Paragon of Perfection; Most _Charmant_, most _Tuant_.\r\n\r\n  _L. Fan._ Ah, my dear Child: I! Alas, Alas! Time has been, and\r\n  yet I am not quite gone; but thou hast those Attractions, which I\r\n  bewail the want of: Poetry, Latin, and the French tongue.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ I must confess, I have ever had a Tendress for the\r\n  Muses, and have a due Reverence for _Helicon_, and _Parnassus_,\r\n  and the Graces: But Heroick Numbers upon Love and Honour are\r\n  most Ravissant, most Suprenant; and a Tragedy is so Touchant! I\r\n  dye at a Tragedy; I'll swear, I do.\r\n\r\nLady Fantast has an adoration of French equal to that of Melantha.\r\n\"No Conversation,\" she says, \"can be refin'd and well-drest without\r\nFrench to lard it.\" The false count wins his way with the ladies when\r\nhe professes to believe them French:\r\n\r\n  _Count._ Me vil gage a hundred Pistol, dat dat fine Ladeè and her\r\n  ver pretty Sister, are de French Ladeè.\r\n\r\n  _L. Fan._ We have often bewailed the not having had the honour to\r\n  be born French.\r\n\r\n  _Count._ Pardon me, is impossible.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ _Monfoy, je parle vray!_ we are meer English\r\n  _assurement_.\r\n\r\n  _Count._ _Mon foy, je parle vray!_ vat is dat Gibberish? Oh,\r\n  lettè me see; de Fader is de Lawyere, an she learne of him at de\r\n  Temple: is de Law French. I am amazè! French Lookè, French Ayre,\r\n  French Mien, French Movement of de Bodee! Morbleu. Monsieur, I\r\n  vil gage 4,500 Pistol, dat dese two Sister vere bred in _France_,\r\n  yes. Teste bleau, I can no be deceive.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ _Jee vous en prie_, do not; we never had the blessing\r\n  to be in _France_; you do us too much Honour. Alas, we are forc'd\r\n  to be content with plain _English_ Breeding: you will bring all\r\n  my blood into a blush. I had indeed a _penchen_ always to French.\r\n\r\nThe barber-count makes fun of the French of the ladies Fantast, but\r\nin one of the conversations the joke is turned the other way, for\r\nMrs. Fantast's learning very nearly proves fatal to the count:\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ You know very well what the Poet says:\r\n\r\n      _Res est Solliciti plena timoris amor._\r\n\r\n  _Count._ Ver well, Madam, you be de most profound Ladee, and de\r\n  great Scholar.--[_Aside._] Morbleu, she vill findé me out! Begar,\r\n  I can no read.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ No, no assurement, pretty well read in the Classic\r\n  Authors. Or so. Monsieur _Scudery_ says very well:\r\n\r\n      _L'amour est une grande chose._\r\n\r\n  _Count._ Hee bee ver pretty Poet too.--Begar she will puzzle me.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ Poet, Monsieur! he writ Romances.\r\n\r\n  _Count._ Ah, Madam, in France we callè de Romance, de Posie.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ And as Monsieur _Balzac_ says, _Songez un peu_.\r\n\r\n  _Count._ Dat _Balzac_ write de very good Romance.\r\n\r\n  _Mrs. Fan._ Indeed! I never heard that.\r\n\r\n  _Count._ Je vous assure.--A pox on her reading!\r\n\r\nGertrude is the foil to Mrs. Fantast and she sees no necessity for\r\nthe punctilious breeding of the ladies Fantast. \"Breeding! I know\r\nno Breeding necessary, but Discretion to distinguish Company and\r\nOccasions; and Common Sense, to entertain Persons according to their\r\nRanks; besides making a Curt'sie not awkwardly, and walking with\r\none's Toes out.\"\r\n\r\nTo so low-bred a view of manners Mrs. Fantast can only exclaim, \"_Ars\r\nnon habet Inimicum præter Ignorantem_\"; but Gertrude responds: \"A\r\nLady may look after the Affairs of a Family, the Demeanor of her\r\nServants, take care of her Nursery, take all her Accounts every Week,\r\nobey her husband, and discharge all the Offices of a good Wife, with\r\nher Native Tongue; and this is all I desire to arrive at.\"\r\n\r\nThe two ladies are especially obnoxious to Mr. Oldwit, who exhausts a\r\nBillingsgate vocabulary in his irritation at their follies. He sums\r\nup his misery in the exclamation, \"He that would have the Devil more\r\ndamn'd, let him get him to marry a She-Wit!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Wright's _The Female Vertuosos_ (1693) is confessedly\r\ndrawn from \"the great Original of French Comedy.\" Ten of the\r\ncharacters and most of the situations are plainly modeled on _Les\r\nFemmes Savantes_, but the name of the play and the idea of ridiculing\r\nthe new science may have been suggested by Shadwell's _The Vertuoso_,\r\na popular attack on the Royal Society. Wright gains a trace of\r\noriginality by transferring his chief learned ladies from the realm\r\nof word-mongery to that of pseudo-science. The tone of the play is\r\nindicated by the prefixed quotation from Dryden's translation of\r\nJuvenal's Sixth Satire:[485]\r\n\r\n      Oh what a Midnight Curse has he, whose Side\r\n      Is pester'd with a Mood and Figure Bride!\r\n      Let mine, ye Gods! if such must be my Fate,\r\n      No Logic learn, nor History translate,\r\n      But rather be a quiet, humble Fool:\r\n      I hate a Wife to whom I go to School.\r\n\r\nThe three \"Vertuosos\" are Lady Meanwell, Mrs. Lovewit, and Catchat.\r\nMrs. Lovewit has been making laboratory experiments in behalf of the\r\n_literati_. She has collected all the plays that ever came out and is\r\nplanning to put them in a limbeck and extract all the quintessence\r\nof wit that is in them to sell by drops to the poets of the age.\r\nMrs. Meanwell has just made the great discovery that rain comes from\r\nclouds. With a housewifely objection to the wet streets of London\r\nand a corresponding sense of civic responsibility, she has invented\r\na way of keeping the streets as dry and clean as a drawing-room\r\nthe year round. She has just been to the Lord Mayor to propose her\r\nscheme, which is to erect a series of posts similar to the lamp-posts\r\nnewly set up in London, equip them with great bellows, and have city\r\nwatchmen to blow the clouds away. Catchat is interested in astronomy.\r\nThrough a telescope she has seen men in the moon and been almost\r\nembarrassed by the loving looks cast upon her by the amorous sparks\r\nof that shining world.\r\n\r\nWhile science is the main interest in this play, the other accepted\r\ntraits of the learned woman are not neglected. Catchat, for instance,\r\nhas been nurtured on the _Grand Cyrus_ and theoretically accepts\r\nits cold guidance in matters of love. But her platonic ideals\r\nfade before her desires, and she becomes the most impassioned\r\nhusband-hunter of the throng. Literary criticism is not omitted. Mr.\r\nMaggot Jingle's poem \"To the Countess of _Squeezingham_ upon her\r\nAGUE\" gains rapturous praise from the ladies. The maid Lucy is about\r\nto be discharged for having committed \"the horrid, scandalous, and\r\nexorbitant Offence\" of saying that \"Cowley, the wretched Cowley, was\r\nas good a poet as the incomparable Sir Maggot Jingle.\"\r\n\r\nThe domestic infelicity of Lord and Lady Meanwell is described as a\r\nresult of the lady's learning. Lord Meanwell says of her, \"My wife\r\nis a terrible Dragon when she is out of Humour; she makes indeed a\r\nHigh Boast of her Philosophy but she is not a bit the less Cholerick\r\nfor it, and her Morals that teach her to look upon all Things with an\r\nindifferent Eye have not the least Influence on her Passions.\" Lady\r\nMeanwell is a virago before whose hard words her husband shrinks into\r\ncowed submission.\r\n\r\nAs an outcome of their combined wits these ladies are about to open\r\nan \"Academy of _Beaux Esprits_,\" where they may communicate to\r\neach other such discoveries as they make, and which shall serve as\r\nan \"Apollo's Levee\" to the Sapphos of the Age, and as a Sovereign\r\nTribunal for all new books.\r\n\r\nCongreve's contribution to the learned lady in comedy comes in _The\r\nDouble Dealer_ (1694), in the admirable figure of Lady Froth, \"a\r\ncoquet pretender to poetry, wit, and learning.\" Her pet affectation\r\nis that of an extravagant passion for her husband, Lord Froth, the\r\nsolemn coxcomb of the play, and her affections have been bound up\r\nwith her literary aspirations even from the days of their courtship.\r\nShe had known love and sleepless nights and whimsies and vapors, but\r\nshe had also known how to give them vent.\r\n\r\n  _Cynthia._ How pray, Madam?\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ O I writ, writ abundantly;--do you never write?\r\n\r\n  _Cynthia._ Write what?\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ Songs, elegies, satires, encomiums, panegyrics,\r\n  lampoons, plays, or heroic poems.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of her learning and her lord's title Lady Froth assumes\r\nsuperiority over Cynthia, the modest, sensible heroine.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ My Lord Froth is as fine a gentleman and as much\r\n  a man of quality! Ah, nothing at all of the common air!... I\r\n  think I may say he wants nothing but a blue ribbon and a star to\r\n  make him shine, the very phosphorus of our hemisphere. Do you\r\n  understand those two hard words?... Being derived from the Greek\r\n  I thought you might have escaped the etymology.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship is also an author and has written an heroic poem on her\r\nconnubial bliss. She communicates this fact to Brisk, the foolish\r\ncritic.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ Did my lord tell you? yes, I vow, and the subject\r\n  is my lord's love to me. And what do you think I call it? I dare\r\n  swear you won't guess--'The Syllabub'; ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ Because my lord's title's Froth, egad; ha! ha! ha! deuce\r\n  take me, very _à propos_ and surprising, ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ He! ay, is not it?--And then I call my lord\r\n  Spumoso, and myself--what d' ye think I call myself?\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ Lactilla, maybe;--'gad I can not tell.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ Biddy, that's all, just my own name.\r\n\r\nLady Froth was certainly not without a competent critical apparatus\r\nfor writing poetry since she declares herself familiar with Bossu,\r\nRapin, Dacier upon Aristotle, and Horace. The wittiest portion of the\r\nplay is based on Molière's scene where the lady critics praise the\r\nfoolish poet. In Congreve the foolish poet is a woman and the critic\r\na man, but the comic situation is essentially the same.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ Then you think that episode between Susan, the\r\n  dairy-maid, and our coachman, is not amiss; you know I may\r\n  suppose the dairy in town as well as in the country.\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ Incomparable, let me perish!--But then being an heroic\r\n  poem, had not you better call him a charioteer? charioteer sounds\r\n  great; besides, your ladyship's coachman having a red face, and\r\n  you comparing him to the sun; and you know the sun is called\r\n  Heaven's charioteer.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ Oh, infinitely better! I am extremely beholden to\r\n  you for the hint; stay, we'll read over those half a score lines\r\n  again. (_Pulls out a paper._) Let me see here, you know what goes\r\n  before,--the comparison, you know. (_Reads._)\r\n\r\n      For as the sun shines every day.\r\n      So, of our coachman I may say--\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ I'm afraid that simile won't do in wet weather; because\r\n  you say the sun shines every day.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ No, for the sun it won't, but it will do for the\r\n  coachman; for you know there's most occasion for a coach in wet\r\n  weather.\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ Right, right, that saves all.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ Then, I don't say the sun shines all the day, but\r\n  that he peeps now and then; yet he does shine all the day too,\r\n  you know, though we don't see him.\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ Right, but the vulgar will never comprehend that.\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ Well, you shall hear--Let me see. (_Reads._)\r\n\r\n      For as the sun shines every day,\r\n      So, of our coachman I may say,\r\n      He shows his drunken fiery face,\r\n      Just as the sun does more or less.\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ That's right, all's well, all's well--\"More or less.\"\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ (_Reads._)\r\n\r\n      And when at night his labour's done,\r\n      Then too, like Heaven's charioteer the sun.\r\n\r\n  Ay, charioteer does better.\r\n\r\n      Into the dairy he descends,\r\n      And there his whipping and his driving ends;\r\n      There he's secure from danger of a bilk,\r\n      His fare is paid him, and he sets in milk.\r\n\r\n  For Susan, you know, is Thetis, and so--\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ Incomparably well and proper, egad!--But I have one\r\n  exception to make;--don't you think bilk (I know it's good\r\n  rhyme), but don't you think \"bilk\" and \"fare\" too like a\r\n  hackney-coachman?\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ I swear and vow, I am afraid so--And yet our Jehu\r\n  was a hackney-coachman when my lord took him.\r\n\r\n  _Brisk._ Was he? I'm answered, if Jehu was a\r\n  hackney-coachman.--You may put that in the marginal notes\r\n  though, to prevent criticism, and say, \"Jehu was formerly a\r\n  hackney-coachman.\"\r\n\r\n  _Lady Froth._ I will; you'd oblige me extremely to write notes on\r\n  the whole poem.\r\n\r\nIn 1697 there appeared a play by \"W. M.\" entitled _Female Wits_. Up\r\nto this time the character of the learned lady had been general in\r\ntype and based pretty closely on Molière, but with _Female Wits_ the\r\nsatire became personal. The point of the play was that the three\r\n\"wits\" should be recognized as representing specific ladies. Calista\r\nwas Catherine Cockburn, a beautiful young girl who at seventeen had\r\nhad the misfortune to have a tragedy brought out at the Theater\r\nRoyal.[486] She was treated rather gently, being merely bantered\r\nfor pretending to understand Latin and Greek. On being asked if she\r\nhad read Cicero's _Oration_ she answered, \"I know it so well as to\r\nhave turned it into Latin.\" Marsilia was Mrs. Manley, two of whose\r\ntragedies, _The Royal Mischief_ and _The Lost Lover_, had appeared\r\nthe preceding year.[487] She is represented as having a play in\r\nrehearsal. In the meantime she has a new project on the stocks. She\r\nis going to show the superiority of the moderns to the ancients by a\r\nrevision of \"Catiline's Conspiracy.\" The first speech is to remain\r\nas it is in the original, while the others, re-written with all the\r\nornaments of modern rhetoric, will show up, by contrast, the poverty\r\nof the Latin style. The sample she gives of her new version was\r\nundoubtedly a fling at heroic tragedy. Her address to Rome begins:\r\n\"Thy fated Stones, and thy cemented Walls, this Arm shall scatter\r\ninto Atoms. Then on thy Ruins will I mount! Mount, my aspiring\r\nSpirit, mount! Hit yon azure Roof and justle Gods!\" Mrs. Wellfed, \"a\r\nfat female author,\" was at once known to stand for Mrs. Pix,[488]\r\na writer of intolerable tragedies and poor comedies, and noted for\r\nher love of good living. Except for the personal reference this play\r\noffers little that can be of interest.\r\n\r\nVanbrugh's _Æsop_ (1699) is a play adapted from Boursault. Æsop is\r\nthe sage to whom successive people bring their problems. To each\r\none he gives a solution in a verse fable. Hortensia, the heroine of\r\none of these episodes, is described by her maid as \"the wise Lady,\r\nthe great scholar, that nobody can understand.\" She loves \"Words of\r\nErudition,\" and waxes eloquent on philosophical abstractions. There\r\nis something in her nature that soars too high for the vulgar, but\r\nshe hopes to find in Æsop a kindred soul because, as she says, \"His\r\nIntellects are categorical.\" But Æsop scorns her fine language. \"Now\r\nby my Faith, Lady,\" he answers, \"I don't know what _Intellect_ is;\r\nand methinks _categorical_ sounds as if you call'd me Names. Pray\r\nspeak that you may be understood; Language was designed for it,\r\nindeed it was.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Hortensia's lover asks Æsop's advice as to the best way to\r\nmanage a \"Philosopheress,\" the wise man advises retreat while there\r\nis yet time. The little apologue of \"The Linnet and the Nightingale\"\r\nembodies his views and is the most trenchant expression so far come\r\nupon of the supposed permanent opposition between learning and the\r\neternal feminine:\r\n\r\n      Once on a time, a Nightingale\r\n          To Changes prone;\r\n      Unconstant, fickle, whimsical,\r\n          (A Female one)\r\n      Who sung like others of her kind,\r\n          Hearing a well-taught Linnet's Airs,\r\n      Had other matters in her mind,\r\n          To imitate him she prepares.\r\n      Her Fancy strait was on the Wing:\r\n          I fly, quoth she,\r\n          As well as he;\r\n          I don't know why\r\n          I should not try\r\n      As well as he to sing.\r\n      From that day forth she chang'd her Throat:\r\n      She did, as learned Women do,\r\n          Till every thing\r\n          That heard her sing\r\n      Wou'd run away from her--as I from you.\r\n\r\nIn Charles Gildon's _Comparison between the Two Stages_ (1702) we\r\nhave a discussion by two gentlemen, Rambler and Sullen, and a critic,\r\nChagrin, as to the comparative merits of Drury Lane and Lincoln's Inn\r\nFields. The most important reference to women playwrights is in the\r\nfollowing passage:\r\n\r\n  _Rambler._ Proceed to the next.\r\n\r\n  _Sullen._ \"The Lost Lover, or, The Jealous Husband.\"\r\n\r\n  _Rambler._ I never heard of that.\r\n\r\n  _Sullen._ Oh this is a Lady's!\r\n\r\n  _Crit._ How's that?--Audetg; viris contendere virgo?\r\n\r\n  _Rambler._ See how Critick starts at the naming a lady.\r\n\r\n  _Crit._ What occasion had you to name a Lady in the confounded\r\n  work you're about?\r\n\r\n  _Sullen._ Here's a Play of hers.\r\n\r\n  _Crit._ The Devil there is. I wonder in my heart we are so lost\r\n  to all Sense and reason: What a Pox have the Women to do with\r\n  the Muses? I grant you the Poets call the Nine Muses by the names\r\n  of Women, but why so? not because the Sex had anything to do with\r\n  Poetry, but because in that Sex they're fitter for Prostitution.\r\n\r\n  _Rambler._ Abusive, now you're abusive Mr. Critick.\r\n\r\n  _Crit._ Sir I tell you we are abus'd: I hate these\r\n  Petticoat-Authors; 't is false Grammar, there's no Feminine for\r\n  the Latin word, 't is entirely of the Masculine Gender, and the\r\n  Language won't bear such a thing as a she-Author.\r\n\r\n  _Sullen._ Come, come, you forget your self; you know 't was a\r\n  Lady carry'd the Prize of Poetry in France t'other day; and I\r\n  assure you, if the Account were fairly stated, there have been in\r\n  England some of that Sex who have done admirably.\r\n\r\n  _Crit._ I'le hear no more on 't: Come Sir, drink about.\r\n\r\n  _Rambler._ To the Fair Author of The Fatal Friendship.\r\n\r\n  _Crit._ Ay, come; away with it, anything that the Glass may go\r\n  round....\r\n\r\nIn Farquhar's _The Inconstant_ (1703) one lady, named \"Bisarre\"\r\nbecause of her odd, capricious ways, illustrates Pope's \"Most women\r\nhave no character at all,\" so briskly does she change from \"a\r\nstarch'd piece of Austerity\" to a pert madcap. As a prude she takes\r\nrank among the learned ladies. She has a grave, reverend air, and is\r\ndubbed \"a Plato in Petticoats.\" She wins the affections of Captain\r\nDuretete--a man socially hampered by a University education--when\r\nshe talks to him in his own language. \"The Forms that Logicians\r\nintroduce,\" she begins in pedantic tone, \"and which proceed from\r\nsimple Enumeration, are dubitable.\" Duretete interrupts in an\r\necstasy, \"She's mine, Man; she's mine: My own Talent to a T. I'll\r\nmatch her in Dialectics, faith. I was seven Years at the University,\r\nMan, nurs'd up with _Barbara_, _Celarunt_, _Darii_, _Ferio_,\r\n_Baralipton_. Did you know that 't was Metaphysics made me an Ass?\"\r\nBisarre is the only heroine whose learning wins her a husband.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Centlivre's _The Basset Table_ (1705) the charming young\r\nValeria has a lover whom she intends to marry, but she is too much\r\noccupied with scientific research to have any time for darts and\r\nflames and lover's sighs. Fortunately Ensign cares so much for\r\nValeria and her ducats that he is able to endure the tediousness of\r\ncourtship in which laboratory experiments supersede passion.\r\n\r\n  _Ensign._ 'T is true, that little She Philosopher has made me\r\n  do Penance more heartily than ever my Sins did; I deserve her\r\n  by mere dint of Patience. I have stood whole Hours to hear her\r\n  assert, that Fire cannot burn, nor Water drown, nor Pain afflict,\r\n  and Forty ridiculous Systems....\r\n\r\n  _Sir Jam._ And all her Experiments on Frogs, Fish, and Flies, ha,\r\n  ha, without the least contradiction.\r\n\r\n  _Ensign._ Contradiction, no, no, I allow'd all she said, with,\r\n  undoubtedly, Madam,--I am of your Mind, Madam, it must be\r\n  so--Natural Causes, &c.\r\n\r\n  _Sir Jam._ Ha, ha, ha, I think it is a supernatural Cause, which\r\n  enables thee to go thro' this Fatigue; if it were not to raise\r\n  thy Fortune, I should think thee mad to pursue her.\r\n\r\nHe cannot edge in a word of love so absorbed does she declare herself\r\nto be in observing the circulation of blood in a fish's tail. Valeria\r\nis quite ahead of her time in her passion for dissection. She has\r\ndevoted her pretty dove to the cause of research, and offers her\r\njewels in return for her cousin's fine Italian greyhound, likewise\r\nto be used in her pursuit of anatomical secrets. When accused of\r\ncruelty she exclaims in quite a modern tone, \"Can Animals, Insects,\r\nor Reptiles be put to a nobler use than to increase our Knowledge?\"\r\nShe loses her sailor lover by breaking in upon his sea lingo with a\r\nrequest that he should speak, \"properly, positively, laconically,\r\nand naturally\" and by deluging him with questions about mermaids and\r\nthe inhabitants of the stars. He quickly determines that he doesn't\r\nregard a \"Philosophical Gimcrack the value of a cockle-shell,\" and\r\nconsiders the lovely young Valeria as \"fitter for Moorfields than\r\nMatrimony.\" She turns away from him with a sigh at the time wasted on\r\na being so irrational as a suitor, and devotes herself again to the\r\n\"immense Pleasures of dear, dear Philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nLady Reveller and her woman, Alphiew, sharply criticize Valeria for\r\nher unfeminine occupations.\r\n\r\n  _Lady._ Will you ever be weary of these Whimsies?\r\n\r\n  _Val._ Whimsies! Natural Philosophy a Whimsy! Oh! the unlearned\r\n  World.\r\n\r\n  _Lady._ Ridiculous Learning!\r\n\r\n  _Alp._ Ridiculous, indeed, for Women; Philosophy suits our Sex as\r\n  Jack Boots would do.\r\n\r\n  _Val._ Custom would bring them as much in Fashion as Furbeloes,\r\n  and Practice would make us as valiant as e'er a Hero of them all;\r\n  the Resolution is in the Mind--Nothing can enslave that.\r\n\r\n  _Lady._ My Stars! this Girl will be mad, that's certain.\r\n\r\n  _Val._ Mad! so Nero banish'd Philosophers from Rome, and the\r\n  first Discoverer of the Antipodes was condemn'd for a Heretic.\r\n\r\n  _Lady._ In my Conscience, Alphiew, this pretty Creature's\r\n  spoil'd. Well, Cousin, might I advise, you should bestow your\r\n  Fortune in founding a College for the Study of philosophy, where\r\n  none but Women should be admitted; and to immortalize your Name,\r\n  they should be called Valerians, ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\n  _Val._ What you make a jest of, I'd execute were Fortune in my\r\n  Power.\r\n\r\nThe heroine of Charles Johnson's _The Generous Husband_ (1711),\r\nFlorida, is described as a \"Pretender to Learning, a Philosophress.\"\r\nShe is young, beautiful and with a tolerable dower. But she is\r\ninvincibly opposed to marriage. She gives caustic analyses of the\r\nlawyer, the courtier, the soldier, the country squire, proposed by\r\nher father with matrimonial intent. \"I'll not be married,\" she says,\r\n\"I'll not submit myself to the uneven Temper of a Humourist; I'll\r\nneither be a Prop to a Fool's Fortune, nor a Bar to a Libertine's\r\nPleasure.\" \"I hate Men, I hate the Cumber of a Family, everything\r\nconcurs to discourage me, to make me fear it, to make it my Aversion.\r\nStudy has nothing in it but what is serene and calm.\" When her father\r\nurges the loss of her inheritance if she does not marry, her unmoved\r\nanswer is, \"I shall have still a good Book--which I am persuaded\r\nI shall love much better than a bad Husband--I'll tell you, Sir,\r\nfor these three Years that I have been acquainted with Aristotle,\r\nwe have not had the least difference together.\" Various lovers\r\npresent themselves. One of them says he trembles whenever he visits\r\nher because she puts him so in mind of his schoolmaster, but he\r\ndetermines to stand \"a little Ear-bating before Marriage\"--encouraged\r\nthereto by the lady's money--with the hope of devising effective\r\nrestraints after marriage. Another bold lover ventures upon her\r\nin her study where she sits surrounded by books and mathematical\r\ninstruments. He is disguised as a traveling _Japanese_ philosopher,\r\nand she enters upon the conversation with a learned salutation--_Vir\r\nColendissime si tu illorum Eruditorum_, but he begs her in the name\r\nof Dr. Bentley not to repudiate her \"vernacular Idiom,\" and the\r\ninterview proceeds in the English tongue. All goes prosperously until\r\nthe pseudo-philosopher speaks of love. She dismisses him with \"What a\r\nterrible Solecism in good Manners has this Fellow committed--_Nunquam\r\nminus solus quam cum solus_; excellent _Scipio_--I admire that\r\nthought.\" She yields to love only when the learned Mr. Dypthong, who\r\nhas \"corrected every Nod in Homer,\" appears as a suitor. He has just\r\nescaped from the \"_Gothic_ Persecution of a sort of _Animalcula_\r\ncall'd Punsters\" and comes to her as an Oracle of Reason. This is the\r\nright approach and his victory is assured when he praises her noble\r\neasy _Odes_ that Horace would not blush to own, her immortal Sonnet\r\non _Cato_, her mastery of \"both the Ethos and the Pathos.\" She pays\r\nhim in kind with honeyed compliments from the Muses and the Graces.\r\nThey discuss the Cartesian system, and the Epicurean, the Peripatetic\r\nand the Platonic Schools of Thought. The inhabitants of the moon come\r\nin for passing notice. The soul and the mind receive analysis. This\r\nsort of courtship suits her. 'T is thus a \"Philosophress\" should\r\nbe wooed. She balks a little at the marriage articles, praying Mr.\r\nGrub to alter the savage style of them into something more genteel,\r\nat least in so far as to let the dates be \"Calendar and Ides\"; the\r\npounds and pence, \"Sesterces and Talents.\" But she yields the point\r\non making the unhappy discovery that to be learned and polite in\r\ndower articles would be illegal, that the law demands tautology,\r\nverbiage, an impertinent jargon. It is only when Mr. Dypthong is\r\nunmasked a villain that Florida becomes \"sick of Letters,\" lays\r\naside the \"Severity of Thought\" along with her big folios, and\r\naccepts the paternal choice in the way of a husband. Her father,\r\nwhose slightest remarks have received pitiless logical analysis\r\nfrom his daughter, who is urged to maintain silence or to speak\r\n\"positively--laconically--naturally,\" whose arguments are met with\r\nclassic quotations that are but as gibberish to his uninstructed ear,\r\nhands her over to a husband with a sigh of relief. His conclusion is,\r\n\"Wit in a Woman is like Mettle in a blind Mare.\" The lover agrees\r\nthat \"a She-Understanding shou'd always be passive.\" Learning, he\r\nsays, may give a woman more Sail, but she's sure to lack Ballast!\r\n\r\nIn January, 1717, there appeared a farce at Drury Lane entitled\r\n_Three Hours after Marriage_. It was the joint work of Gay, Pope, and\r\nArbuthnot, but the character of the learned lady, Phœbe Clinket,[489]\r\nwas by Pope. Phœbe is not an important person in the plot. She was\r\nevidently drawn merely to caricature a learned lady, in this case an\r\nauthoress. She comes upon the stage in an ink-stained dress with pens\r\nstuck in her hair. Her maid carries strapped to her back a desk on\r\nwhich Phœbe writes:\r\n\r\n  _Maid._ I had as good carry a raree-show about the street. Oh!\r\n  how my back akes!\r\n\r\n  _Clink._ What are the labors of the back to those of the brain?\r\n  Thou scandal to the muses, I have now lost a thought worth a\r\n  folio, by thy impertinence.[490]\r\n\r\n  _Maid._ Have I not got a crick in my back already, that will make\r\n  me good for nothing, with lifting your great books?\r\n\r\n  _Clink._ Folio's, call them, and not great books, thou monster\r\n  of impropriety. But have patience, and I will remember the three\r\n  gallery-tickets I promis'd thee at my new Tragedy.\r\n\r\n  _Maid._ I shall never get my head-cloathes clear-starch'd at\r\n  this rate.\r\n\r\n  _Clink._ Thou destroyer of learning, thou worse than a book-worm!\r\n  Thou hast put me beyond all patience. Remember how my lyric ode\r\n  bound about a tallow-candle; thy wrapping up snuff in an epigram;\r\n  nay, the unworthy usage of my Hymn to _Apollo_, filthy creature!\r\n  read me the last lines I wrote upon the _Deluge_, and take care\r\n  to pronounce them as I taught you.\r\n\r\n  _Maid._ (_Reads with an affected tone._)\r\n\r\n      Swell'd with a dropsy, sickly Nature lies,\r\n      And melting in a diabetes, dies.\r\n\r\n  _Clink._ Still without Cadence!\r\n\r\n  _Maid._\r\n\r\n      Swell'd with a dropsy--\r\n\r\n  _Clink._ Hold. I conceive ...\r\n\r\n      The roaring seas o'er the tall woods have broke,\r\n      And whales now perch upon the sturdy oak.\r\n\r\n  Roaring? Stay. Rumbling, roaring, rustling. No; raging seas.\r\n  (_Writing._)\r\n\r\n      The raging seas o'er the tall woods have broke,\r\n      Now perch, thou whale, upon the sturdy oak.\r\n\r\n  Sturdy oak? No; steady, strong, strapping, stiff. Stiff? No;\r\n  stiff is too short.\r\n\r\n      What feast for fish! Oh too luxurious treat!\r\n      When hungry dolphins feed on butchers meat.\r\n\r\n  _Foss._ Niece, why, niece, niece! Oh, _Melpomene_, thou goddess\r\n  of tragedy, suspend thy influence for a moment, and suffer my\r\n  niece to give me a rational answer.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of the first act is devoted to a development of the\r\nsatiric representation of an authoress, and the character is given\r\nspecial point by the fact that it was intended for Lady Winchilsea.\r\nProbably no woman of the time was more cruelly pilloried. Exactly\r\nwhy Pope chose to give so disagreeable a picture of her it would\r\nbe difficult to say, but fortunately one is not obliged to give a\r\nreasonable basis for Pope's satirical sketches. For the occasion\r\nit is sufficient to say that her dramatic attempts were not to his\r\ntaste, and that some obscure personal irritation led him to take the\r\nopportunity of this play to speak his mind.\r\n\r\nIn minor points the character might be counted fairly applicable to\r\nLady Winchilsea. Her learning, her devotion to literary pursuits, her\r\nfecundity in verse, her opposition to amatory themes, her detestation\r\nof the modern stage, are all characteristics that tally with the\r\nburlesque portrait. Lady Winchilsea was also very religious, and\r\nthough herself maid of honor to Mary of Modena and so necessarily\r\nmuch in the corrupt Restoration court, was even unnecessarily strict\r\nand severe on the subject of morals and manners. This prudishness was\r\nsatirized by Phœbe Clinket's boast that she is \"unwilling to stand\r\neven on the brink of an indecorum,\" as a result of which delicacy she\r\nhas never allowed in her plays \"the libertinism of lip-embraces,\" and\r\nthis in spite of the fact that Aristotle never actually prohibited\r\nkissing on the stage. But in the main points of Phœbe Clinket's\r\nself-confidence and her determination to push her play at all hazards\r\nto the point of public presentation, there is no hint of a likeness\r\nto Lady Winchilsea, who was exceedingly modest and deprecatory\r\nabout her work. She never willingly allowed her dramatic writings\r\nto pass beyond a small domestic and literary circle, nor out of her\r\nvoluminous verse did any but a very small portion reach publication\r\nwith her permission. Furthermore, the tragedy of _The Universal\r\nDeluge_ attributed to Phœbe Clinket bears no resemblance to any\r\nextant work by Lady Winchilsea.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, quite apart from any personal application, Phœbe\r\nClinket is the most detestable picture of a learned lady in any\r\nof the comedies. She is vain, boastful, and superficial; she is a\r\npedant, a prude, and a hypocrite; and there are no mitigating traits.\r\n\r\nColley Cibber put on his play _The Refusal_ at Covent Garden in 1721\r\nand published it the same year. It is a close version of _Les Femmes\r\nSavantes_, the rich, middle-class family of Sir Gilbert Wrangle in\r\nCibber's play being the counterpart of the wealthy bourgeois family\r\nof Chrysal in Molière. The action follows that of Molière's play,\r\nand Molière gives the model for many of the important situations\r\nand conversations. Curll called _The Refusal_ merely \"a Sampler,\r\nwhereon Monsieur Molière's Stitching may easily be perceived from\r\nMr. Cibber's canvas.\"[491] But Cibber's play is a success in that it\r\nis a brilliant English adaptation of the French original. The two\r\ncharacters that represent learned ladies are Lady Wrangle and her\r\ndaughter Sophronia.\r\n\r\nSir Gilbert thus describes his wife to Mr. Frankly: \"She's a great\r\nplague to me. Not but my lord bishop, her uncle, was a mighty good\r\nman; she lived all along with him; I took her upon his word; 't was\r\nhe made her a scholar; I thought her a miracle; before I had her I\r\nused to go and hear her talk Latin with him an hour together; and\r\nthere I--I--I played the fool.\" Throughout the play Sir Gilbert is\r\nvery evidently a member of \"the hen-pecked fraternity.\" Lady Wrangle\r\nhas an important place in but two scenes and in both of these she\r\nendeavors to domineer over her husband. In the scene with the maid he\r\nis completely cowed, and in the scene of the wedding contract he is\r\ntriumphant only because of abundant friendly backing. Lady Wrangle's\r\nquarrelsome, jealous disposition is perhaps more in evidence than\r\nher learning, but she has learning too. She quotes Latin whenever\r\npossible and is herself an authoress.\r\n\r\nThe famous scene in Molière where the maid Martine is to be dismissed\r\nfor her indifference to Vaugelas and the laws of grammar, becomes in\r\nCibber a similar hurly-burly against the maid and the cook for having\r\nused a sheet of one of Lady Wrangle's productions in which to wrap\r\nthe roast. The maid--\"a brainless ideat,\" \"a dunce,\" \"an illiterate\r\nmonster,\" \"an eleventh plague of Egypt,\" according to the energetic\r\nvituperation of her mistress--seeing the leaf to be blotted and\r\nblurred took it for waste paper.\r\n\r\n  Blurred! you driveller! Was ever any piece perfect, that had not\r\n  corrections, erasures, interlineations, and improvements! Does\r\n  not the very original show, that when the mind is warmest, it is\r\n  never satisfied with its words:\r\n\r\n      _Incipit et dubitat; scribit, damnatque tabellas,_\r\n      _Et notat, et delet; mutat, culpatque probatque._\r\n\r\nThe leaf in question is a part of Lady Wrangle's translation of the\r\npassion of Byblis. Her husband calls it the passion of Bibble-Babble,\r\nand says, \"If a line on't happens to be mislaid, she's as mad as a\r\nblind mare that has lost her foal; she'll run her head against a\r\nstone-wall to recover it. All the use I find of her learning is, that\r\nit furnishes her more words to scold with.\"\r\n\r\nLady Wrangle's creed as expressed to Charlotte is, \"Refine your soul;\r\ngive your happier hours up to science, arts, and letters; enjoy\r\nthe raptures of philosophy, subdue your passions, and renounce the\r\nsensual commerce of mankind.\" She, however, claims Frankly as her\r\nlover, a virtuous and platonic one, to be sure, but so irrevocably\r\nhers as to preclude significant attentions to others. When she learns\r\nof his open love to Charlotte--she exclaims, \"I thought virtue,\r\nletters, and philosophy had only charms for him: I have known his\r\nsoul all rapture in their praises.\" And her indignation that he\r\nshould \"contaminate his intellects with such a chit of an animal\"\r\nchanges her platonic love into the most jealous hate. Her philosophy\r\nas to the proper conduct of the passions has no influence on her\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nSophronia is unlike her prototype Armande, in that Cibber converts\r\nher some time before the end of the play and she takes a husband\r\nwith a delight equal to that of Charlotte herself. Sophronia was,\r\non her father's second marriage, when he was foolishly enamoured\r\nof Lady Wrangle's Latin, put into the hands of the Bishop to be\r\nmade by him into a second prodigy of learning. She had also the\r\nadvantage of being instructed by her stepmother in the doctrines of\r\nplatonic love. Her learning, her doctrine of the union of souls, her\r\nenthusiasm for poetry, all give an effect of genuineness. Her lover\r\nGranger understands her well. He grants her \"half mad with learning\r\nand philosophy,\" but still \"a fool of parts and capable of thinking\r\nright.\" Frankly had formerly made love to her in conventional\r\nfashion, but to him she had shown herself a marble-hearted lady, a\r\nproud and haughty prude. But Granger knows how to approach her. He\r\nhumors all her romantic notions, chimes in with all her raptures\r\nin the air, scouts all love that is but an affair of the veins and\r\nthe arteries, exalts only the sexless union of harmonious minds and\r\nsouls, quotes Latin, declaims blank verse, makes slow and delicate\r\nand utterly submissive and reluctant approaches to so mundane a\r\nthought as marriage, and finally she falls a victim to blandishments\r\nso adroitly mingled. Granger's words, like Hybla drops, distil\r\nupon her sense; faint philosophy deserts her; and \"like a wounded\r\ndove\" she \"trembling hovers to her mate for succour\" in the most\r\napproved romantic style. When her stepmother says accusingly, \"What\r\nthen becomes of your Platonic system?\" she answers, \"Dissolved,\r\nevaporated, impracticable, and fallacious all: you'll own I have\r\nlabour'd in the experiment, but found at last, that to try gold in a\r\ncrucible of virgin-wax was a mere female folly.\" And she closes the\r\nplay with\r\n\r\n      In vain, against the force of nature's law,\r\n      Would rigid morals keep our hearts in awe;\r\n      All our lost labours of the brain but prove,\r\n      In life there's no philosophy like love.\r\n\r\nThe characters of Lady Wrangle and Sophronia with their affectations\r\nand useless learning are emphasized by the natural, sensible\r\nCharlotte who serves as a foil. She is a gay, laughing, wheedling,\r\nfascinating little rogue with a quick wit, and a genius for common\r\nsense. She cannot believe that a soul was crammed into a body just\r\nto spoil sport and she gives her whole nature free play. She loves\r\nMr. Frankly and says so, and she avows her preference for marriage\r\nas against philosophical mysteries. Her praises are recited by\r\nMr. Frankly in the words, \"As she does not read Aristotle, Plato,\r\nPlutarch, or Seneca, she is neither romantic nor vain of her\r\npedantry; and as her learning never went higher than Bickerstaff's\r\nLetters, her manners are consequently natural, modest and agreeable.\"\r\n\r\nIn Bickerstaff's _Lionel and Clarissa_ (1768), Sir John Flowerdew\r\nseems quite in advance of his age in securing a tutor for his\r\ndaughter and in considering \"a little knowledge\" necessary for\r\na woman. \"I am far,\" he says, \"from considering ignorance as a\r\ndesirable characteristic; when intelligence is not attended with\r\nimpertinent affectation, it teaches them [women] to judge with\r\nprecision, and gives them a degree of solidity necessary for the\r\ncompanion of a sensible man.\" This, however, is a cool statement of\r\ntheory. When his daughter outwits him and marries the tutor, he has a\r\nviolent reaction in favor of the straitest training a maid can have:\r\n\r\n        Girls like squirrels oft appear,\r\n      In their cages, pleased with flav'ry,\r\n      But, in fact, 't is all but knav'ry;\r\n        Less thro' love than out of fear:\r\n      Only on their tricks relying,\r\n      Let them out, their hands untying,\r\n        And You'll see the matter plain.\r\n      Once there's naught their flight to hamper,\r\n      Presto--whisk-away they scamper;\r\n        Never to return again.\r\n      Wou'd you manage lasses rightly,\r\n      You must watch them daily, nightly,\r\n      Shut them close, and hold them tightly;\r\n        Never loose an inch of chain:\r\n      Freedom, run-aways will make 'em,\r\n      And the devil can't o'ertake 'em.\r\n\r\nExcept for _Lionel and Clarissa_ there were after Cibber's _Refusal_\r\nfew representations of the learned lady as a comic type, until after\r\nthe revival of the comedy of manners under Sheridan and Goldsmith.\r\nThe sentimental comedy was occupied in rescuing super-sensitive,\r\nover-refined, delicate, tearful, and helpless heroines from the\r\nplots of abnormally dark villains, and in bestowing the prizes thus\r\ncaptured on the high-minded, self-conscious Sir Charles Grandisons\r\nwho posed as heroes of the play. Comic types fell by the way until\r\nGoldsmith succeeded in his knight-errantry in behalf of the goddess\r\nof fun, and routed sensibility, and sentimentality. And the learned\r\nladies in the comedy after 1770 represent a new kind of learning,\r\nand the ladies themselves are in many respects unlike their sisters\r\nof an earlier date.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE NOVEL-READING GIRL AS A COMIC TYPE\r\n\r\nThe learned-lady theme had an interesting variant in the\r\nnovel-reading girl. This type, as it appeared in comedy and fiction,\r\nis also of French origin. It finds its direct ancestry in Molière's\r\n_Les Précieuses_ (1659), a satiric representation of the vogue of\r\nthe French romances, most of which appeared in the twenty-five years\r\nbefore _Les Précieuses_.[492]\r\n\r\nAlong with the vogue of the romances came the critical comment.\r\nScarron's _Roman Comique_ (1651) burlesqued La Calprenède. Boileau's\r\n_Héros de Romans_ (1664) and _L'Art Poétique_ (1674) satirized\r\nespecially the romances of Scudéry. The two satires that showed the\r\neffect of the romances on the minds of young girls were Molière's\r\n_Les Précieuses_ and later Furetière's _Roman Bourgeois_ (1666).\r\n\r\nThese romances and satires were almost as well known in the original\r\nto cultivated Englishmen as they were to Frenchmen. There were\r\nalso numerous translations. Between 1647 and 1660 _Polexandre_,\r\n_Cassandre_, _Ibrahim_, _Artemène_, _Clélie_, _Almahide_,\r\n_Cléopâtre_, all appeared in English versions, and some of them\r\nseveral times. And the satires were also promptly translated. There\r\nis no better illustration of the general English familiarity with\r\nthose romances than that furnished by the letters Dorothy Osborne\r\nwrote to Sir William Temple in 1652-54. The Hôtel de Rambouillet\r\ncoterie itself could hardly have been more nearly letter perfect in\r\nthe details than was this young English lady. Her reading becomes\r\nso absorbing that her grave lover finds it necessary to caution her\r\nagainst the \"late hours\" reported to him. She is penitent, but her\r\nenthusiasm is unabated. Parts of _Cléopâtre_, she says, pleased her\r\nmore than anything she had ever read in her life. She confesses that\r\nshe cried an hour together over the sad story of Almanzor, and was so\r\nangry with Alcidiana that she could never love her after. But she is\r\nno uncritical admirer of the heroes and heroines. Her sense of humor\r\ndoes not forsake her. She laughs at _L'Amant Jaloux_, in _Cyrus_, as\r\none who seeks his own vexation, and _L'Amant mon Aimé_ was \"an ass.\"\r\nSir William's interest in the romances is hardly less than Dorothy's.\r\nShe sends him the separate volumes as she completes them, and there\r\nis a lively interchange of impressions and comments on various\r\ncharacters and situations.[493]\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration the fondness for romances may have been\r\nsomewhat lessened by the new passion for the theater. But\r\nromance-readers were still numerous. Pepys tells us that his wife\r\nsat up till twelve over the _Grand Cyrus_. Again he says, \"I find\r\nmy wife troubled at my checking her last night in a coach in her\r\nlong stories out of the _Grand Cyrus_ which she would tell, though\r\nnothing to the purpose, nor in any good manner.\" However, he must\r\nhave repented of his rigor, for we find him later calling at Martin's\r\nhis book-seller's, where he bought _Cassandre_ and some other French\r\nbooks for his wife's closet. And Mr. Pepys himself confesses to at\r\nleast one Sunday devoted to French romances.[494]\r\n\r\nThat Mr. and Mrs. Pepys were not alone in their tastes is made\r\nevident by contemporary arraignment of the romances as harmful\r\ninfluences. Mr. Pepys records a conversation with a Mr. Wilson who\r\nprotested passionately against them as perverters of history. _The\r\nLadies' Calling_ (1673) brings the matter home to daily life:\r\n\r\n  There is another thing to which some devote a very considerable\r\n  part of their time, and that is the reading Romances, which seems\r\n  now to be thought the peculiar and only becoming study of young\r\n  ladies. I confess their youth may a little adapt it to them when\r\n  they were Children, and I wish they were always in their event\r\n  as harmless; but I fear they often leave ill impressions behind\r\n  them. Those amorous passions which 't is their design to paint\r\n  to the utmost life are apt to insinuate themselves into their\r\n  unwary Readers, and by an unhappy inversion a Copy shall produce\r\n  an Original. When a poor young Creature shall read there of some\r\n  triumphant Beauty, that has I know not how many captiv'd Knights\r\n  prostrate at her feet, she will probably be tempted to think it a\r\n  fine thing; and may reflect how much she loses time, that has not\r\n  yet subdued _one_ heart; and then her business will be to spread\r\n  her nets, lay her toils to catch somebody who will more fatally\r\n  ensnare her. And when she has once worried herself into an amour,\r\n  those authors are subtil Casuists for all difficult cases that\r\n  may occur in it, will instruct in the necessary artifices of\r\n  deluding parents and friends, and put her ruin perfectly in her\r\n  own power. And truly this seems to be so natural a consequent of\r\n  this sort of study, that of all the divertisements that look so\r\n  innocently, they can scarce fall upon any more hazardous. Indeed\r\n  't is very difficult to imagine what mischief is done to the\r\n  world by the false notions and images of things: particularly\r\n  of Love and Honour, those noblest concerns of human life,\r\n  represented in these mirrors.[495]\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the French romances and the protests they aroused\r\nwould naturally make the romance-loving girl a type of genuine social\r\ninterest, and it is surprising that this element of Molière's _Les\r\nPrécieuses_ was not sooner taken up in English comedy. There were, to\r\nbe sure, occasional references to romance-reading something in the\r\nstyle of Molière. In Shadwell's _Bury-Fair_ (1689), for instance,\r\nGertrude is apparently familiar \"with Romances and Love and Honour\r\nPlays,\" and she complains that all the lovers talk so in the style\r\nof the romances that a girl knows in advance just what compliments\r\nshe must listen to.[496] And in Wright's _Female Vertuosos_ (1693)\r\nSir Maurice says, \"O' my Conscience, Women's Heads, now-a-days, are\r\nso stuff't up with their Trash of Romances and Poetry, that there is\r\nno Room left in 'em for Reason, or Common Sense.\" Later he bewails\r\nhis fate more bitterly: \"This Plague of Wit has infected all my\r\nServants, even my little Boy, forsooth, can not turn the Spit now\r\nwithout a _Pharamond_ or a _Cassandra_ in his hand.\" But it was not\r\ntill Steele's _Tender Husband_ in 1705 that the romance-reading girl\r\nappeared in England as a developed type. Steele's Biddy Tipkin[497]\r\nis nearly half a century later than Molière's Madelon and Cathos, but\r\nthey are her unquestioned ancestors.\r\n\r\nIn Molière's play the two country girls endeavor to apply to real\r\nlife the ideas they have gained from the romances. Gorgibus, the\r\nfather of Madelon and uncle of Cathos, is a worthy citizen whose\r\ncommon-sense views of life subject him to the scornful raillery of\r\nthe young ladies. He endeavors to provide them with good husbands,\r\nbut his straightforward methods shock their romance-tutored minds.\r\nTo be greeted at the first interview with marriage proposals is a\r\ncrude and coarse proceeding. If Cyrus had married Mandane, and Clélie\r\nhad married Aronce at once, what would have become of Mademoiselle\r\nde Scudéry's romances _Artemène_ and _Clélie_? The dull Gorgibus,\r\nand the lovers he has brought are hopelessly ignorant of _le carte\r\nde Tendre_, ignorant of the regions known as _Billets-doux_,\r\n_Petits-soins_, _Billets-galants_, _Jolis-vers_, and the other\r\nexactly marked stages of a well-wrought courtship. The young ladies\r\neven doubt the reality of their relationship to Gorgibus, and they\r\nreject the names Cathos and Madelon in favor of Polixène and Aminte.\r\nGorgibus attributes all their vagaries to the reading of romances,\r\nand in the climax of his irritation exclaims to the stock of\r\noffending volumes, \"_Et vous, qui êtes cause de leur folie, sottes\r\nbilleveseés, pernicieux amusements des esprits oisifs, romans,\r\nvers, chansons, sonnets et sonnettes, puissiez-vous être à tous les\r\ndiables!_\"\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea and many of the satiric details in the\r\npresentation of Biddy Tipkin in Steele's _The Tender Husband_ exactly\r\nfollow the French model. Biddy's reading is identical with that of\r\nMadelon and Cathos, but wider in scope. She refers familiarly to\r\npassages or characters in _Cléopâtre_, _Cassandre_, _Pharamond_,\r\n_Ibrahim_, _Artemène_, _Clélie_, and _Almahide_, showing that she\r\nhad practically covered the field of romance. She is an heiress under\r\nthe charge of her uncle, Hezekiah Tipkin, a banker of Lombard Street,\r\nand his sister, \"an antiquated virgin with a mighty affectation for\r\nyouth.\" Pounce, a lawyer on the lookout for a rich match for his\r\nclient, the impecunious Captain Cleremont, describes Biddy thus:\r\n\"Well then, since we may be free, you must understand, the young\r\nlady, by being kept from the world, has made a world of her own.\r\nShe has spent all her solitude in reading romances, her head is\r\nfull of shepherds, knights, flowery meads, groves, and streams, so\r\nthat if you talk like a man of this world to her, you do nothing.\"\r\nBut Cleremont, quite equal to the situation, responds, \"Oh, let\r\nme alone--I have been a great traveller in fairy-land myself, I\r\nknow Oroondates; Cassandra, Astræa, and Clelia are my intimate\r\nacquaintance.\" Pounce predicts success for the fluent Captain, but\r\nthere are other plans for Biddy. Her guardians wish her to marry her\r\ncousin, Humphry Gubbin, a country lout, familiarly known as \"Numps.\"\r\nHer attitude towards him and towards her prosaic aunt appears in the\r\nfollowing conversation:\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Was it not my gallant that whistled so charmingly in the\r\n  parlour before he went out this morning? He's a most accomplished\r\n  cavalier.\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Come, niece, come; you don't do well to make sport with\r\n  your relations, especially with a young gentleman that has so\r\n  much kindness for you.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Kindness for me! What a phrase is there to express the\r\n  darts and flames, the sighs and languishings, of an expecting\r\n  lover!\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Pray, niece, forbear this idle trash, and talk like other\r\n  people. Your cousin Humphry will be true and hearty in what he\r\n  says, and that's a great deal better than the talk and compliment\r\n  of romances.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Good madam, don't wound my ears with such expressions;\r\n  do you think I can ever love a man that's true and hearty? What a\r\n  peasant-like amour do these coarse words import! True and hearty!\r\n  Pray, aunt, endeavour a little at the embellishment of your style.\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Alack-a-day, cousin Biddy, these idle romances have quite\r\n  turned your head.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ How often must I desire you, madam, to lay aside\r\n  that familiar name, cousin Biddy? I never hear it without\r\n  blushing--Did you ever meet with a heroine in those idle\r\n  romances, as you call 'em, that was termed Biddy?\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Ah! cousin, cousin, these are mere vapours, indeed;\r\n  nothing but vapours.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ No, the heroine has always something soft and engaging\r\n  in her name; something that gives us a notion of the sweetness of\r\n  her beauty and behaviour; a name that glides through half-a-dozen\r\n  tender syllables, as Elismonda, Clidamira, Deidamia, that runs\r\n  upon vowels off the tongue; not hissing through one's teeth,\r\n  or breaking them with consonants. 'T is strange rudeness those\r\n  familiar names they give us, when there is Aurelia, Sacharissa,\r\n  Gloriana, for people of condition; and Celia, Chloris, Corinna,\r\n  Mopsa, for their maids and those of lower rank.\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Look ye, Biddy, this is not to be supported. I know not\r\n  where you learned this nicety; but I can tell you, forsooth, as\r\n  much as you despise it, your mother was a Bridget afore you, and\r\n  an excellent house-wife.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Good madam, don't upbraid me with my mother Bridget, and\r\n  an excellent house-wife.\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Yes, I say she was; and spent her time in better learning\r\n  than you ever did--not in reading of fights and battles of dwarfs\r\n  and giants, but in writing out receipts for broths, possets,\r\n  caudles, and surfeit-waters, as became a good country gentlewoman.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ My mother, and a Bridget!\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Yes, niece, I say again, your mother, my sister, was a\r\n  Bridget! the daughter of her mother Margery, of her mother Sisly,\r\n  of her mother Alice.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Have you no mercy? Oh, the barbarous genealogy!\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Of her mother Winifred, of her mother Joan.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Since you will run on, then I must needs tell you I am\r\n  not satisfied in the point of my nativity. Many an infant has\r\n  been placed in a cottage with obscure parents, till by chance\r\n  some ancient servant of the family has known it by its marks.\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Ay, you had best be searched--That's like your calling\r\n  the winds the fanning gales, before I don't know how much\r\n  company; and the tree that was blown by it had, forsooth, a\r\n  spirit imprisoned in the trunk of it.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Ignorance!\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Then a cloud this morning had a flying dragon in it.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ What eyes had you, that you could see nothing? For\r\n  my part I look upon it to be a prodigy, and expect something\r\n  extraordinary will happen to me before night.... But you have a\r\n  gross relish of things. What noble descriptions in romances had\r\n  been lost, if the writers had been persons of your gout?\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ I wish the authors had been hanged, and their books\r\n  burnt, before you had seen 'em.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Simplicity!\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ A parcel of improbable lies.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Indeed, madam, your raillery is coarse--\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Fit only to corrupt young girls, and fill their heads\r\n  with a thousand foolish dreams of I don't know what.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Nay, now, madam, you grow extravagant.\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ What I say is not to vex, but advise you for your good.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ What, to burn Philocles, Artaxeres, Oroondates, and the\r\n  rest of the heroic lovers, and take my country booby, cousin\r\n  Humphry, for a husband!\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ Oh dear, oh dear, Biddy! Pray, good dear, learn to act\r\n  and speak like the rest of the world; come, come, you shall marry\r\n  your cousin and live comfortably.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Live comfortably! What kind of life is that? A great\r\n  heiress live comfortably! Pray, aunt, learn to raise your\r\n  ideas--What is, I wonder, to live comfortably?\r\n\r\n  _Aunt._ To live comfortably is to live with prudence and\r\n  frugality, as we do in Lombard Street.\r\n\r\nBy mere force of contrast the way is open for the smooth-tongued Mr.\r\nCleremont. He meets the ladies in the park with such phrases as \"the\r\ncool breath of the morning,\" \"the season of pearly dews and gentle\r\nzephyrs,\" and Biddy is enraptured. After the adroit withdrawal of the\r\naunt by Pounce, Cleremont well maintains with Biddy his reputation as\r\na traveler in fairy-land, and assumes likewise the military prowess\r\nwithout which no romance hero was complete. He soon cleverly turns\r\nthe conversation to a proposal of marriage, but Biddy understands the\r\nlaws of romance too well to yield immediately. They part in the true\r\nspirit of _Cassandre_.\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ We enjoy here, madam, all the pretty landscapes of the\r\n  country without the pains of going thither.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Art and nature are in a rivalry, or rather a\r\n  confederacy, to adorn this beauteous park with all the agreeable\r\n  variety of water, shade, walks, and air. What can be more\r\n  charming than these flowery lawns?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Or these gloomy shades--\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Or these embroidered valleys--\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Or that transparent stream--\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Or these bowing branches on the banks of it, that seem\r\n  to admire their own beauty in the crystal mirror?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ I am surprised, madam, at the delicacy of your phrase.\r\n  Can such expressions come from Lombard Street?\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Alas, sir! what can be expected from an innocent virgin\r\n  that has been immured almost one-and-twenty years from the\r\n  conversation of mankind, under the care of an Urganda[498] of an\r\n  aunt?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Bless me, madam, how have you been abused! Many a lady\r\n  before your age has had an hundred lances broken in her service,\r\n  and as many dragons cut to pieces in honour of her.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Oh, the charming man! [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Do you believe Pamela was one-and-twenty before she knew\r\n  Musidorus?[499]\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ I could hear him ever. [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ A lady of your wit and beauty might have given occasion\r\n  for a whole romance in folio before that age.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Oh, the powers! Who can he be?--Oh, youth unknown--But\r\n  let me, in the first place, know whom I talk to, for, sir, I am\r\n  wholly unacquainted both with your person and your history. You\r\n  seem, indeed, by your deportment, and the distinguishing mark of\r\n  your bravery which you bear, to have been in a conflict. May I\r\n  not know what cruel beauty obliged you to such adventures till\r\n  she pitied you?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Oh, the pretty coxcomb! [_Aside._]--Oh, Blenheim,\r\n  Blenheim! Oh, Cordelia, Cordelia!\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ You mention the place of battle. I would fain hear an\r\n  exact description of it. Our public papers are so defective;\r\n  they don't so much as tell us how the sun rose on that glorious\r\n  day--Were there not a great many flights of vultures before the\r\n  battle began?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Oh, madam, they have eaten up half my acquaintance.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Certainly never birds of prey were so feasted; by\r\n  report, they might have lived half-a-year on the very legs and\r\n  arms our troops left behind 'em.\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Had we not fought near a wood we should never have got\r\n  legs enough to have come home upon. The joiner of the Foot Guards\r\n  has made his fortune by it.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ I shall never forgive your General. He has put all my\r\n  ancient heroes out of countenance; he has pulled down Cyrus and\r\n  Alexander, as much as Louis-le-Grand--But your own part in that\r\n  action?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Only that slight hurt, for the astrologer said at my\r\n  nativity, nor fire, nor sword, nor pike, nor musket shall destroy\r\n  this child, let him but avoid fair eyes--But, madam, mayn't I\r\n  crave the name of her that has so captivated my heart?\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ I can't guess whom you mean by that description; but if\r\n  you ask my name, I must confess you put me upon revealing what I\r\n  always keep as the greatest secret I have--for would you believe\r\n  it, they have called me--I don't know how to own it, but they\r\n  have called me--Bridget.\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Bridget?\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Bridget.\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Bridget?\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Spare my confusion, I beseech you, sir; and if you have\r\n  occasion to mention me, let it be by Parthenissa,[500] for that's\r\n  the name I have assumed ever since I came to years of discretion.\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ The insupportable tyranny of parents, to fix names on\r\n  helpless infants which they must blush at all their lives after!\r\n  I don't think there's a surname in the world to match it.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ No! What do you think of Tipkin?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Tipkin! Why, I think if I was a young lady that had it\r\n  I'd part with it immediately.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Pray, how would you get rid of it?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ I'd change it for another. I could recommend to you three\r\n  very pretty syllables--What do you think of Cleremont?\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ Cleremont! Cleremont! Very well--but what right have I\r\n  to it?\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ If you will give me leave, I'll put you in possession\r\n  of it. By a very few words I can make it over to you, and your\r\n  children after you.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ O fie! Whither are you running? You know a lover should\r\n  sigh in private, and languish whole years before he reveals his\r\n  passion; he should retire into some solitary grove, and make the\r\n  woods and wild beasts his confidants. You should have told it to\r\n  the echo half-a-year before you had discovered it, even to my\r\n  handmaid.\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ What can a lover do, madam, now the race of giants is\r\n  extinct? Had I lived in those days there had not been a mortal\r\n  six foot high, but should have owned Parthenissa for the paragon\r\n  of beauty, or measured his length on the ground--Parthenissa\r\n  should have been heard by the brooks and deserts at midnight, the\r\n  echo's burden and the river's murmur.\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ That had been a golden age, indeed! But see, my aunt has\r\n  left her grave companion and is coming toward us--I command you\r\n  to leave me.\r\n\r\n  _Cler._ Thus Oroondates, when Statira[501] dismissed him her\r\n  presence, threw himself at her feet, and implored permission but\r\n  to live. [_Offering to kneel._]\r\n\r\n  _Niece._ And thus Statira raised him from the earth, permitting\r\n  him to live and love.\r\n\r\nBut Biddy has not the cold constitution of the romance heroines\r\nand she presently acknowledges that she finds in herself all the\r\nsymptoms of a raging amour. \"I love solitude,\" she soliloquizes,\r\n\"I grow pale, I sigh frequently. I call upon the name of Cleremont\r\nwhen I don't think of it--His person is ever in my eyes, and his\r\nvoice in my ears--Methinks I long to lose myself in some pensive\r\ngrove, or to hang over the head of some warbling fountain, with a\r\nlute in my hand, softening the murmurs of the waters.\" And in spite\r\nof her reluctance to abridge courtship and so shut off \"all further\r\ndecoration of disguise, serenade and adventure,\" she finally consents\r\nto an immediate elopement, declaring that if Oroondates had been as\r\npressing as Cleremont _Cassandra_ would have been but a pocket-book.\r\n\r\nBiddy, her aunt, and her two suitors, form the most delightful group\r\nof characters in the comedy of manners before Goldsmith and Sheridan.\r\nAnd Biddy can hold her own against any of the heroines except\r\nCongreve's Millamant. Nance Oldfield created the character in 1705\r\nand it continued to be a favorite on the stage. The play was given\r\nseveral times nearly every year to 1736 and occasionally afterwards,\r\nso that the character of Biddy was one often before the public.\r\n\r\nThere are also other indications that the topic of romance-reading\r\nwas one of continued interest. In 1748 there appeared the second\r\nedition of an anonymous work entitled _The Lady's Drawing-Room. Being\r\na Faithful Picture of the Great World._ One chapter entitled \"The\r\nAdventures of Marilla\" presents a character following in the wake\r\nof \"Biddy Tipkin\" and antedating the _Female Quixote_ by perhaps a\r\ndecade:\r\n\r\n  MARILLA was a young Lady, who, from her most early years,\r\n  discover'd an uncommon Capacity, and, as she grew up, made a\r\n  wonderful Progress, not only in those Accomplishments usually\r\n  allowed to her own Sex, but also in some of those which more\r\n  properly appertain to ours. While a Child herself, she despis'd\r\n  all childish Diversions, and, as she was not a Companion for\r\n  those of riper Years, instead of playing with those of her own,\r\n  she amus'd herself with Reading, in which she took such an\r\n  infinite Delight, that, for a Book she had never seen before, she\r\n  would forego any other Satisfaction could be offer'd her; and,\r\n  tho' any one who had been present when she was thus employ'd,\r\n  and saw with what Swiftness her Eye pass'd from the Top of\r\n  every Page to the Bottom, would have thought it impossible for\r\n  her to receive much Advantage from the Contents, yet was her\r\n  Apprehension so acute, and her Memory so retentive, that whatever\r\n  she look'd over in this Manner was as much her own, as if she\r\n  had been the author of it.--What could be more amazing than\r\n  to hear a Girl, of ten or eleven Years of Age, quote Passages\r\n  from Pliny, Livy, and Sallust, talk of the Policies of Princes,\r\n  compare their several Interests, and the Motives on which War\r\n  and Peace were made, and make such Observations on them as could\r\n  rarely be contradicted! What might not have been expected from\r\n  such a Genius when Time had ripen't it to Perfection?--She had\r\n  also strong Notions of Philosophy, Morality, and Divinity, and\r\n  had only such Books, as tended to the Improvement of her Mind,\r\n  been thrown in her Way, she had doubtless made one of the most\r\n  shining Characters that any Age or Nation has produced; but\r\n  unhappily, she was likewise too well acquainted with Cassandra,\r\n  Cleopatra, Grand Cyrus, Pharamond, and other fabulous Treatises,\r\n  which poison'd her Way of Thinking, and gave her a certain\r\n  Bent of Mind, to which she ow'd all the Misfortunes of her\r\n  future Life. Indeed, I think, there cannot be any Thing more\r\n  pernicious to Youth, than the suffering them to read those idle\r\n  and voluminous Adventures, which have no Foundation either in\r\n  Truth, or good Sense, and I heartily wish, for the Sake not\r\n  only of the young Lady I am speaking of, but of many others\r\n  whose Reason has been perverted by them, tho' perhaps not in an\r\n  equal Degree, that the Government would forbid all such Books\r\n  from being sold or printed.... Marilla was always obliging,\r\n  and affable to every Body, but those who, as I said before,\r\n  declared themselves her Lovers; now was this owing to either the\r\n  Insensibility of her Heart, or to an Imagination, that all who\r\n  address'd her were unworthy to do so, but to those romantick\r\n  Notions she had imbib'd, by reading in what Manner the fictitious\r\n  Ladies of Antiquity had behav'd. She has often, since Time and a\r\n  melancholy Experience of the World, has mortify'd this Foible,\r\n  confess'd, That at that Time, she thought it the most audacious\r\n  and presuming Thing in the World for a Man, to make any publick\r\n  Declaration of his Passion, 'till he had suffer'd the Pangs of\r\n  it, in secret, for three or four Years.--That, even then, he\r\n  ought not to do it, unless Fortune had presented him with the\r\n  Opportunity of ushering it in by some extraordinary Service, and\r\n  that, whenever he express'd himself on that Head, it should be in\r\n  such ambiguous Terms, and with so much Timidity, that it should\r\n  rather be from his alter'd Countenance, and despairing Air The\r\n  Object of his Affections should perceive he lov'd her, than by\r\n  any Words he could be able to speak.--Then, as to her own Part\r\n  in this Farce, it seem'd to her the utmost Indecency in a Woman\r\n  to listen to any amorous Proposals, 'till the Lover had griev'd\r\n  himself to a Skeleton, and was on the Point of falling on his own\r\n  Sword; nor, when he had arriv'd at that Pitch of Desperation,\r\n  was she to vouchsafe him any greater Favour than a Command\r\n  to live.--That, after seven Years, she might, tho' with an\r\n  infinite Shew of Reluctance, allow him to kiss her Hand, confess\r\n  she pity'd him, but no more;--And, if he persevered a second\r\n  Apprenticeship in the same Manner, perhaps, that is, if she found\r\n  none more worthy, reward his faithful Service, by giving herself\r\n  to him.\r\n\r\n  These, she acknowledged, were the Ideas she had of Love and\r\n  Courtship; but, none of her Admirers acting in any Degree\r\n  answerable to them, she look'd on all the Professions of Love\r\n  made to her, as so many Affronts, and return'd them only with\r\n  picquant Repartees, or sullen Silence.\r\n\r\nIn 1752 Mrs. Charlotte Lennox, in _The Female Quixote_, gave an\r\neven more detailed picture of a girl obsessed by romances. Arabella\r\nwas left motherless when very young, and her father lived in\r\nretirement with her on a vast estate in a remote province. She\r\nwas very beautiful, and she was trained under the best masters in\r\ndancing, French, and Italian. But this excellent education had less\r\ninfluence on Arabella than the great store of French romances left\r\nby her mother who had bought them to relieve the tedium of life in\r\nthe lonely castle. Supposing these romances to be pictures of real\r\nlife, Arabella founded all her notions and expectations on them. She\r\nwas on the alert for love adventures, and she misinterpreted the\r\nmost ordinary actions or phrases into some romantic possibility.\r\nArabella had a good mind, lively wit, a sweet temper, a thousand\r\namiable qualities, but her romantic notions permeated her thoughts\r\nand feelings till she became involved in constant absurdities.\r\nGenerosity, courage, virtue, love, were of value to her only as\r\ninterpreted by the romances. Her lover, a courteous, frank, handsome\r\nman of the ordinary world, found all his attractions clouded over\r\nwhen he unfortunately fell asleep over some chapters in the romances\r\nespecially selected for his admiration and imitation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lennox's story satirizes nearly all the salient characteristics\r\nof the French romances. She burlesques their length and the\r\never-recurring histories, adventures, episodes. The romance\r\nconception of courtship and marriage, the lady's power of life\r\nand death over her lover, the exaggerated military prowess of the\r\nlover, the emphasis on unknown but illustrious birth, the bombastic\r\nlanguage, the use of disguises, abductions, banishments, the long,\r\nargumentative conversations, the odd romance letters with high-flown\r\nsuperscriptions and signatures, and florid, stilted style, the\r\nromantic falsification of history, are some of the many elements\r\nclearly portrayed by Mrs. Lennox. But in spite of the minute accuracy\r\nof her work, Mrs. Lennox's Arabella yields in definiteness of\r\nimpression as well as in veracity and charm to Biddy Tipkin.\r\n\r\nShortly after _The Female Quixote_ came a little poem by Mrs. Monk\r\nentitled \"On a Romantick Lady\" in which a lover says to his mistress:\r\n\r\n      This poring over your _Grand Cyrus_\r\n      Must ruin you, and will quite tire us.\r\n      It makes you think, that an affront 't is,\r\n      Unless your lover 's an _Orontes_,\r\n      And courts you with a passion frantick,\r\n      In manner and in stile romantick.\r\n      Now tho' I count myself no Zero,\r\n      I don't pretend to be an hero.\r\n      Or a by-blow of him that thunders,\r\n      Nor are you one of the sev'n wonders.\r\n      But a young damser very pretty,\r\n      And your true name is Mistress _Betty_.\r\n\r\nWith Mrs. Lennox and Mrs. Monk we seem to come to the end of\r\nthe satire on the romance-reading girls. But in 1756 we find in\r\nMurphy's _Apprentice_ a young man, a Mr. Gargle, an apothecary's\r\napprentice, whose wits have gone astray through reading romances.\r\n\"An absurd, ridiculous, a silly empty-headed coxcomb,\" exclaims his\r\nexasperated father, \"with his _Cassanders_ and his _Cloppatras_,\r\nand his trumpery; with his Romances, and his damn'd plays and\r\nhis _Odyssey_ Popes, and a parcel of fellows not worth a groat!\"\r\nCharlotte, Mr. Gargle's innamorata, was \"as innocent as water-gruel\"\r\nbefore he taught her to read play-books; but she was not permanently\r\ninjured by them, for before she had read far her father locked her\r\nbooks away and confined her in her room. In the projected romantic\r\nescape Charlotte is all practicality and good sense, but Mr. Gargle\r\ndemands rope-ladders, moonlight, emotions, attitudes, and poetical\r\nquotations, and so spoils all.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Gargle lags behind his generation. Romances were being\r\nrapidly replaced by the novel. Between 1740 and 1753 _Pamela_,\r\n_Joseph Andrews_, _Jonathan Wild_, _Clarissa Harlowe_, _Tom Jones_,\r\n_Amelia_, and _Sir Charles Grandison_ had established the new\r\nspecies. And the romance-reading girl speedily gives way to the\r\nnovel-reading girl.\r\n\r\nThe first representative of this type comes in 1760 in George\r\nColman's _Polly Honeycomb_, at the very end of the period we are\r\nconsidering. In the Prologue Colman shows a clear recognition of the\r\nchange of type. He says:\r\n\r\n      Hither in days of yore, from Spain or France,\r\n      Came a dread sorceress, her name ROMANCE.\r\n      O'er Britain's isle her wayward spell she cast,\r\n      And common sense in magick chain bound fast.\r\n      In mad sublime did each fond lover wooe,\r\n      And in heroicks ran each _billet-doux_:\r\n      High deeds of chivalry their sole delight,\r\n      Each fair a maid distress'd, each swain a knight.\r\n      Then might _Statira Oroondates_ see,\r\n      At tilts and tournaments, arm'd cap-a-pie.\r\n      She too, on milk-white palfrey, lance in hand,\r\n      A dwarf to guard her, pranc'd about the land.\r\n\r\n             *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      But now, the dear delight of later years,\r\n      The younger sister of ROMANCE appears:\r\n      Less solemn in her air, her drift the same,\r\n      And NOVEL her enchanting, charming, name.\r\n      ROMANCE might strike our grave forfathers' pomp,\r\n      But NOVEL for our buck and lively romp!\r\n      Cassandra's folios now no longer read,\r\n      See, two neat pocket-volumes in their stead!\r\n      And then so _sentimental_ is the stile.\r\n      So chaste, yet so bewitching all the while!\r\n      Plot, and elopement, passion, rape, and rapture,\r\n      The total sum of ev'ry dear--dear--Chapter.\r\n      'T is not alone the small-talk and the smart,\r\n      'T is NOVEL most beguiles the female heart.\r\n      Miss reads--she melts--she sighs--Love steals upon her--\r\n      And then--Alas, poor girl!--goodnight, poor honour!\r\n\r\nWhen Colman published the play he prefixed a list of one hundred and\r\neighty-two novels which purports to be an \"Extract from the catalogue\r\nof one of our most popular circulating libraries; from which extract\r\nthe reader may, without any great degree of shrewdness, strain the\r\nmoral of this performance.\"[502] Of these books over one hundred\r\nare in the form of \"Lives,\" \"Memoirs,\" or \"Adventures.\" The list\r\ncontains the principal novels of Richardson, Fielding, and Smollett,\r\nbut the majority of the books have passed into the limbo of the\r\nforgotten, if, indeed, they ever existed. Polly gets her books from a\r\ncirculating library in London, or purchases them from the bookseller,\r\nand she keeps up with the new books as they come out, but she does\r\nnot mention any of the books in Colman's list. _The History of Sir\r\nGeorge Truman and Emilia_, _The British Amazon_, _The Adventures of\r\nTom Ramble_, _The History of Dick Carless_, _History of Amelia_, are\r\nthe only novels she speaks of by the title. Her familiarity with\r\nnovels in general is such that she merely refers to the characters\r\nin an offhand fashion. Nurse indicates the scope of Polly's reading\r\nin \"Yes, yes, you are always reading your simple story-books. The\r\n_Ventures_ of Jack this, the history of Betsey t'other, and Sir\r\nHumphreys, and women with hard Christian names.\"[503] But Polly\r\nmerely refers to Clarinda and to Julia, to Betsey Thompson, to Sally\r\nWilkins, as girls who eloped because they had obstinate, ill-natured\r\nparents; to Bob Lovelace as a writer of charming letters; to poor\r\nClarissa and ugly Mr. Soames; to Nancy Howe and Mr. Hickman; to poor\r\nSophy Western as one locked up by an irate father; to Tom Jones, a\r\nfoundling and yet a gentleman's son. She means to marry Scribble,\r\nthough they \"go through as many distresses as Booth and Amelia.\"\r\nShe belabors Mr. Ledger with \"I hate you; you are as deceitful as\r\nBlifil, as rude as the Harlowes, and as ugly as Dr. Slop.\" After she\r\nhas assailed this unwelcome suitor from Change-alley with \"You are a\r\nvile book of Arithmetick, a table of pounds, shillings, and pence;\r\nyou are uglier than a figure of eight, and more tiresome than the\r\nmultiplication-table,\" she rejoices over her successful vituperation.\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha! there he goes! ha, ha, ha! I have out-topped them all;\r\nMiss Howe, Narcissa, Clarinda, Polly Barnes, Sophy Willis, and all of\r\nthem. None of them ever treated an odious fellow with so much spirit.\r\nThis would make an excellent chapter in a new Novel. But here comes\r\npapa; in a violent passion, no doubt. No matter: It will only furnish\r\nmaterials for the next chapter.\"\r\n\r\nThough it is apparent that Polly was reading Richardson and Fielding,\r\nyet the book that held temporary ascendancy over her imagination was\r\n_Sir George Truman_. By a clever device she is introduced reading the\r\nbook and giving lively comments thereon:\r\n\r\n  _Polly._ Well said, Sir George! Oh, the dear man. But so--\"With\r\n  these words the enraptur'd baronet [_reading_] concluded his\r\n  declaration of love.\"--So!--\"But what heart can imagine,\r\n  [_reading_] What tongue describe, or what pen delineate, the\r\n  amiable confusion of Emilia?\"--Well, now for it!--\"Reader, if\r\n  thou art a courtly reader, thou hast seen, at polite tables, iced\r\n  cream crimsoned with raspberries; or, if thou art an uncourtly\r\n  reader, thou hast seen the rosy-finger'd morning dawning in the\r\n  golden East;\" Dawning in the golden East! Very pretty.--\"Thou\r\n  hast seen, perhaps, [_reading_] the artificial vermilion on\r\n  the cheeks of Cleora, or the vermilion of nature on those of\r\n  Sylvia; thou hast seen--in a word, the lovely face of Emilia was\r\n  overspread with blushes.\" This is a most beautiful passage, I\r\n  protest! Well, a Novel for my money!--[_reading_] \"Sir George\r\n  touched at her confusion, gently seized her hand, and softly\r\n  pressing it to his bosom [_acting it as she reads_] where the\r\n  pulses of his heart beat quick, throbbing with tumultuous\r\n  passion, in a plaintive tone of voice, breathed out, 'Will you\r\n  not answer me, Emilia?'\" Tender creature!--\"She, half raising\r\n  [_reading and acting_] her downcast eyes, and half inclining\r\n  her averted head, said in faltering accents,--yes, Sir!\" Well,\r\n  now!--\"Then, gradually recovering, with ineffable sweetness she\r\n  prepared to address him: when Mrs. Jenkinson bounced into the\r\n  room, threw down a set of china in her hurry, and strewed the\r\n  floor with porcelain fragments: Then turning Emilia round and\r\n  round, whirled her out of the apartment in an instant, and struck\r\n  Sir George dumb with astonishment at her appearance. She raved;\r\n  but the baronet resuming his accustomed effrontery....\" Novels,\r\n  Nursee, novels! [exclaims Polly.] A novel is the only thing to\r\n  teach a girl life, and the way of the world, and elegant fancies,\r\n  and love, to the end of the chapter!... Do you think, Nursee, I\r\n  should have had such a good notion of love so early, if I had not\r\n  read novels?... Oh, Nursee, a Novel is the only thing!... Lord,\r\n  Nursee, if it was not for novels and love-letters a girl would\r\n  have no use for her writing and reading.\r\n\r\nIt is from her precious novels that the energetic young Polly has\r\na head so full of intrigues and contrivances. Rope-ladders or tied\r\nsheets and a feather-bed under the window, disguises, letters in\r\nlemon-juice, ink concealed in a pin-cushion, and paper and pens in\r\na fan, all the devices of a thwarted amour, are as the alphabet\r\nof intrigue to Polly. No wonder the cautious Mr. Ledger finally\r\nwithdraws his suit. \"She'd make a terrible wife for a sober citizen.\r\nWho can answer for her behaviour? I would not underwrite her for\r\nninety _per cent._\" Mr. Honeycomb attributes all Polly's vagaries to\r\n\"these damn'd story-books,\" and concludes, \"A man might as well turn\r\nhis daughter loose in Covent-Garden, as trust the cultivation of her\r\nmind to A CIRCULATING LIBRARY.\"\r\n\r\nLydia Languish in Sheridan's _Rivals_ (1775) carries us beyond the\r\nlimits of this study, but Lydia must be mentioned here because she\r\nbrings this topic to a natural chronological close and because of her\r\nrelationship to the characters already noted. Judged from the point\r\nof view of the books selected, Biddy, Marilla, and Arabella belong\r\nto the romance-readers, as opposed to Polly Honeycomb and Lydia\r\nLanguish, the novel-readers. But the lists of Polly and Lydia are far\r\nfrom identical. Lydia is, indeed, quite up to date in her novels.\r\nNine of the fifteen she mentions were first published between 1768\r\nand 1773.[504] And her reading is much less sensational and trashy\r\nthan that of Polly. The bustling, executive Polly cannot for a moment\r\nbe considered the real ancestor of Lydia. It is on Biddy Tipkin that\r\nLydia is more nearly modeled. The points of similarity between _The\r\nTender Husband_ and _The Rivals_ have often been noted, and it is in\r\nthe Biddy and Lydia portion that this kinship is closest. Lydia with\r\nher two suitors and her aunt make up a group fundamentally like the\r\none of which Biddy is the center, though, of course, Biddy's \"Urganda\r\nof an aunt\" is infinitely less amusing than \"the old weather-beaten\r\nshe-dragon,\" Mrs. Malaprop, and Numps and Captain Cleremont are but\r\nfaint forerunners of Bob Acres and Captain Absolute. But the original\r\nconception, the general relationship of these characters, their\r\nfunction in the play, are much the same. Biddy and Lydia are alike in\r\noccasional details and almost identical as type characters. And Lydia\r\nas a heroine given over to mischievous reading is like the other\r\nheroines in arousing in the harassed guardian or parent numerous\r\nprotests against romances and novels. Mrs. Malaprop and Sir Anthony\r\nAbsolute sum up all that has been said in the earlier plays. Mrs.\r\nMalaprop would not have young women become \"progenies\" of learning,\r\nand her ideal maid who goes to school at nine to learn a \"little\r\ningenuity and artifice,\" \"a supercilious knowledge of accounts,\" with\r\na little geography and reading, pretty well represents the amount\r\nof education the ordinary young girl was getting. And Sir Anthony\r\nprotests against the inevitable evils consequent on teaching girls to\r\nread:\r\n\r\n  All this is the natural consequence of teaching girls to read.\r\n  Had I a thousand daughters, by Heavens! I'd as soon have them\r\n  taught the black art as their alphabet!... Madam, a circulating\r\n  library in a town is, as an evergreen tree, of diabolical\r\n  knowledge ... it blossoms through the year!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Material not easily accessible]\r\n\r\nIn any attempt to trace a single line of thought or a social tendency\r\nthrough a long and remote period the difficult accessibility of the\r\nmaterial must be premised. It is disheartening to note how many of\r\nthe desired facts lurk in corners and byways, and are come upon\r\nalmost by chance. A stray allusion followed up may lead to some\r\nrich little pocket of information, while laboriously conducted\r\nexplorations prove futile. It is the discovery of these pockets\r\nof ore that constitute the rewards of the adventure. But such\r\nsatisfaction is constantly clouded by a sense of the pockets that\r\nhave been missed. Whatever discoveries reward the investigator, there\r\nis always a tantalizing sense of having hardly more than passed the\r\noutlying boundaries of what might be found.\r\n\r\nAlong with sins of omission it is regrettably certain that there\r\nmust be sins of commission. In individual instances the discovery\r\nof further material might result in a somewhat different evaluation\r\nof the literary or historic significance of the person concerned.\r\nAnd certain it is that fuller records would reveal force and charm\r\nin many a woman presented now by but a meager array of unsuggestive\r\nbiographical facts.\r\n\r\nA final difficulty results from a carelessness as to dates in\r\ncontemporary records of the period studied, especially with regard\r\nto minor people, so that chronology is sometimes led into a dim and\r\nconfused region of conjecture and approximation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Women in literary biography]\r\n\r\nOmission of important persons, mistakes in emphasis, an occasional\r\ndubious chronology, are due in part to the general condition of\r\nliterary biography till long after the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The details regarding men were often meager and inexact, but\r\nmuch more so was this the case with regard to women. When Ballard\r\nbegan the preliminary studies for his memoirs of learned ladies he\r\nfound the utmost difficulty in getting any reliable data. He refers\r\nto Leland, Bale, Pits, and Tanner as men whose works he had studied\r\nfor general method. But from none of these could he get direct aid in\r\nhis own field of research. Various records of Oxford and Cambridge\r\ncould render but incidental service, Edward Philips's _Threatrum\r\nPoetarum_ (1675); John Aubrey's _Brief Lives_ (known as early as\r\n1680); William Winstanley's _Lives of the most famous English Poets_\r\n(1687); Gildon's edition of Langbaine's _Dramatic Poets_, with a\r\nsecond volume on Poets in 1688, were somewhat more helpful. But in\r\nall these put together there were only a few pages devoted to women.\r\nJohn Shirley's _Illustrious History of Women_ (1686) and Juncker's\r\n_Catalogue of Learned Women_ (1692) have practically nothing to offer\r\ntowards a history of learned English women. John Evelyn's _Numismata_\r\n(1697) gives a list of renowned persons \"worthy the honour of\r\n_Medal_,\" in the course of which he mentions some instances of the\r\n\"Learned, Virtuous and Fair Sex,\" beginning with Boadicea. Thirteen\r\nEnglishwomen are in the list, but with only the briefest notice.\r\nGiles Jacob's _Poetical Register_ (1724) goes more into detail, but\r\nin his two volumes there are only fifteen pages of female biography.\r\nMrs. Cooper includes no woman in her _Muse's Library_ (1737) and\r\nHayward in his _The British Muse_ (1738) makes but one quotation\r\nfrom a woman. John Wilford's _Memorials and Characters_ (1741) was\r\ncompiled with the idea of presenting examples of piety and virtue.\r\nOf the eighty-one women noted only a few come within the category\r\nof learned women. Thomas Birch in his _Illustrious Persons of Great\r\nBritain_ (1752) includes no women but Queens.\r\n\r\nThe meager gleanings from the best biographical records before 1752\r\nput stronger emphasis on the importance of George Ballard's _Memoirs\r\nof Several Ladies of Great Britain_ as a book of original research,\r\nand as the first source of detailed and ordered, and, in general,\r\naccurate information concerning the learned women of England.[505]\r\n\r\nOf later sources the first is Theophilus Cibber's _Lives of the\r\nPoets_ (1753). Rather full accounts of fourteen women are given\r\nby Cibber, eight of them being names not included in Ballard's\r\nbook.[506] The _Eminent Ladies_ (1755) was but a weak compilation of\r\npoems with brief and perfunctory comment. In the _New and General\r\nBiographical Dictionary_, published in 1761, the most imposing\r\nbiographical work of the period, out of more than five thousand names\r\nless than twenty English women of letters are listed.\r\n\r\nThe first book after Ballard to take up female biography exclusively\r\nappeared in 1766 and is entitled: _Biographium Femineum. The Female\r\nWorthies: or, Memoirs of the Most Illustrious Ladies of all Ages and\r\nNations, who have been Eminently distinguished for their Magnanimity,\r\nLearning, Genius, Virtue, Piety, and other excellent Endowments,\r\nconspicuous in all the various Stations and Relations of Life, public\r\nand private. Containing (exclusive of Foreigners) The Lives of above\r\nFourscore British Ladies, who have shone with a peculiar Lustre, and\r\ngiven the noblest proofs of the most exalted Genius, and Superior\r\nWorth. Collected from History, and the most approved Biographers,\r\nand brought down to the present Times_ (1766). This book is based\r\non Ballard, Cibber, and _Eminent Ladies_, but also, unfortunately,\r\naccepts Amory as an authority.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 William Alexander published _The History of Women_, in two\r\nvolumes. Mr. Alexander has comparatively little to say about learned\r\nwomen. He wrote, he said, to \"amuse and instruct the Fair Sex,\"\r\nhoping thus to lure them from poring over novels and romances. He\r\navoided technical and foreign terms and all citation of authorities\r\nas being \"perplexing to the sex,\" and while his book professes to\r\nbe a sort of propagandist tract for female education, he so abhors\r\nfemale pendantry and so laments fair eyes dimmed by severe and\r\nintense study that his book is a distinct reaction from the dignified\r\nearlier ideals. Dr. Johnson admits no women into the society of his\r\nfifty-two _English Poets_ (1779-81). The _Biographia Britannica_\r\n(1778-93) includes Mary Beale and ten literary women. All of these\r\nexcept Mrs. Delany had appeared in Ballard or Cibber. Mary Hays's\r\n_Female Biography_, published in England in 1803 and in America in\r\n1807, in three volumes, includes celebrated women in \"all Ages and\r\nCountries.\" It is based on Ballard and the other authorities already\r\nindicated. The uncritical character of the book is indicated by the\r\nremark of Miss Hays, \"My book is intended for women and not for\r\nscholars.\" Robert Southey, in 1809, in his _Specimens of the Later\r\nEnglish Poets_, begins with the time of James II. Out of two hundred\r\nand twenty-three poets represented, seventeen are women. In the\r\nthirty-two volumes of Chalmers's _General Biographical Dictionary_\r\n(1812) about thirty English learned ladies are briefly noted. In\r\nCampbell's _British Poets_ (1819) there is but one woman, Katherine\r\nPhilips, among the one hundred and seventy names he gives. Alexander\r\nDyce, in _Specimens of British Poetesses_, in 1827, gives brief\r\nextracts in chronological order from eighty-three authors, but with\r\nonly the slightest possible apparatus of notes and dates. The purpose\r\nof Mr. Dyce was to exhibit the progress of English women in poetry,\r\nand his book was planned and partly executed before he happened upon\r\nthe _Eminent Ladies_, a reprint of which appeared about 1780. On a\r\nperusal of that book he found it so unimportant a precursor as not\r\nto interfere with his plan. Over half of Mr. Dyce's work is given to\r\nwomen after 1750. Of the forty-nine before that period, beginning\r\nwith Juliana Berners and ending with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, very\r\nfew are represented by more than two or three pages of quotation.\r\nLady Winchilsea, owing doubtless to Wordsworth's recent eulogy of\r\nher, is given eleven pages. Mr. Dyce did considerable independent\r\nresearch, for he quoted from a good many poems by women not mentioned\r\nby previous authors. Wordsworth had planned a similar work and had\r\nmade extracts for it, \"lucid crystals,\" he says, \"culled from a\r\nParnassian Cave seldom trod.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the nineteenth century various books, such as\r\nMiss Costello's _Memoirs of Eminent Englishwomen_ (1844), Mrs. Hale's\r\n_Woman's Record_ (1853), Jane Williams's _Literary Women of England_\r\n(1861), Julia Kavanagh's _English Women of Letters_ (1863), with\r\nother compilations treating especially of late eighteenth-century\r\nfiction but recognizing also the works of Mrs. Behn, Mrs. Manley, and\r\nMrs. Haywood, seemed to indicate a recrudescence of interest in the\r\nwork of women. But in most of these books the treatment is so vague\r\nand popular as to be of little use.\r\n\r\nOf more value than formal condensed statements in biographical\r\ncompilations are autobiographies, letters, contemporary allusions,\r\nworks in prose and verse, prefaces, and early individual biographies.\r\nThanks to a steadily growing interest in the period 1660 to 1800,\r\nthere has been an accumulation during recent years of special\r\ncritical editions of early works, of manuscripts published after long\r\nyears of oblivion, and of reprints of valuable productions. It is in\r\nparticular to this class of material that the student must go in an\r\nattempt to evolve personalities from scattered facts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The term \"learned\"]\r\n\r\nThe term \"learned\" as applied to women demands careful chronological\r\ndefinition. It would be used to-day, without any strong bias of\r\napproval or disapproval, to describe a woman who in some reputable\r\nrealm of learning has a competent apparatus of the facts involved,\r\nand a mind trained to order and interpret these facts. Such\r\nintellectual activity would be differentiated from creative work in\r\npoetry, fiction, and drama. But the phrase \"learned women\" as used\r\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had no such specialized\r\napplication. The contemporary defenders of \"The Excellency of the\r\nFemale Sex\" give the widest and loosest possible meaning to the term.\r\nIt sometimes stood for the most solid attainments, but it was also\r\nmade to cover very rudimentary intellectual strivings. An avowed\r\ntaste for reading, the faintest interest in physical phenomena, the\r\ncomposition of slight little poems, the writing-out of prayers and\r\nmeditations, even the copying of extracts into a common-place book,\r\ncould, in applause or derision, be counted as learned occupations.\r\nThis wide inclusiveness results inevitably in the practical\r\nbreaking-down of any set of qualities as necessarily connoted by the\r\nterm \"learned.\"\r\n\r\nEqually undiscriminating was the use of examples whereby to establish\r\nthe possible mentality of women. History and tradition were of equal\r\nauthority, the Muses and Sibyls counting as much as the great names\r\nof later days. The uncritical lists of learned ladies record as of\r\napparently equal importance the \"physical fancies\" of the Duchess of\r\nNewcastle and the exact botanical knowledge of Elizabeth Blackwell;\r\nthe playful coquetting with foreign tongues by some society ladies\r\nand the close linguistic attainments of Miss Elstob or Mrs. Collyer;\r\nthe wide sweep of general information of Mrs. Delany and the minute\r\ninvestigation into the field of early English by Mrs. Cooper.\r\n\r\nA similar ill-defined use of the term \"learned\" is inevitable in\r\nthe present attempt to estimate the intellectual tendencies of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth century women. In the evaluation of the\r\nwork of individual women as their names arise critical standards\r\ncan be given due weight. But in general it is not the object of\r\nthis study to test the scholastic, scientific, or literary work of\r\nthe women of the period by modern academic ideas of excellence. The\r\npurpose here is rather to show the number of women whose interests\r\nwere intellectual, whose chosen pursuits had to do with books\r\nand things of the mind, and who were demanding a new freedom of\r\nself-expression, new training, and new opportunities.\r\n\r\nStill another preliminary statement seems necessary. The period from\r\n1650 to 1760 is a rich and crowded one. Even when regarded from a\r\nsingle comparatively barren point of view such as an account of\r\nlearned women, it offers too much material for a single volume. To\r\nkeep at all within limits it is necessary to hold the presentation\r\nof each learned woman merely to those points in her life and work\r\nthat have to do with her as an exponent of new ideals for women, or\r\nas marking by her own achievements new feminine possibilities in the\r\narts, in learning, or in letters. Complete presentation would involve\r\nalmost a separate volume for each important woman. Many of the women\r\nhere studied offer interesting subjects for further investigation. A\r\nnew insight into the religious, the social, and the domestic life of\r\nthe period would be given by full biographies of such women as Anne\r\nKilligrew, Lady Winchilsea, Bathsua Makin, Mrs. Cooper, and indeed of\r\nmany others. Such studies would be invaluable as a contribution to\r\nthe history of the late seventeenth and the early eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Periods in intellectual progress of women]\r\n\r\nA retrospect of the progress of the intellectual freedom and the\r\nsystematic education of women in England does not reveal an orderly\r\nacceleration from period to period. There are, instead, periods of\r\nactivity followed by periods of quiescence. Two such periods, one of\r\nactivity, one of quiescence, may be noted before the Restoration.\r\n\r\nThe reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth have been called the golden\r\nage for learned women,[507] and even a cursory glance over these\r\nyears serves to justify that reputation. Theoretical statements by\r\ndistinguished foreigners such as that by Castiglione; the opinions\r\nof such men as Vives and Hyrde, of Mulcaster, Ascham, Udall, and\r\nErasmus; the example of the royal family and many great nobles in\r\nsecuring the most learned instruction for their daughters; the\r\ninfluence of at least two learned queens, Catherine of Aragon and\r\nElizabeth; the actual scholarship of many distinguished women; the\r\nwarm praise of this scholarship by the most eminent men, made up\r\na general atmosphere strongly stimulating to learned attainment\r\nby women. Individual opportunities of so high a character, and a\r\nreception so genial and even eager towards the intellectual activity\r\nof women did not again recur in England. But this golden age remains\r\nas hardly more than a brilliant picture; it has practically no\r\nimportant place in the progress of the education of women. The\r\nadvantages given to women were nullified, so far as initiating more\r\nwidespread activities is concerned, by two inherent defects. The\r\nlearning of women had no legitimate purpose or outcome beyond the\r\nhome. It was the object of adulation and flattery, but it seldom came\r\ninto competition with the work of men where it could be judged on its\r\nmerits. It had always a small audience favorably disposed in advance.\r\nLearning was a kind of high-class individual accomplishment purely\r\nfor home consumption. A second defect was that learning belonged only\r\nto the daughters of the nobility or of the very rich. Even within\r\nthese bounds it was sporadic, depending entirely on the opinion of\r\nthe head of the family.\r\n\r\nA gradual decline of interest in scholarship as an appropriate\r\npursuit for damsels of high lineage was apparent even in Elizabethan\r\ndays, and the change from Tudor ideals became marked in the period\r\nfrom the death of Elizabeth to the Restoration.[508] James looked\r\nupon women with contempt. Queen Anne's mother, Sophia of Mecklenburg,\r\nwas a highly gifted woman who, after her retirement from public life,\r\ndevoted her leisure to astronomy, chemistry, and other sciences.\r\nBut Anne had none of her mother's intellectual interests. She cared\r\nonly for fine dresses and jewels, progresses and masks, and gay\r\nfrivolous entertainments.[509] So she brought no literary ideals or\r\nambitions to counteract the king's cold indifference to education in\r\ngeneral. Under Charles I and Henrietta Maria there might readily have\r\narisen in a new and lighter form some educational ideals or schemes\r\nfavorable to women, for the King loved music and painting and had\r\nwell-developed literary tastes, and the Queen had great respect for\r\nthe French salons of her day and was interested in the general ideas\r\nof the _précieuses_. But the troubled times of the Civil War turned\r\nthe minds of both men and women to sterner tasks. And it is perhaps\r\nnot strange that this period proves the most barren one in English\r\nhistory so far as the education of girls is concerned.\r\n\r\nAt the Restoration we enter upon a new era of feminine activity.\r\nThe beginnings of this era do not, however, coincide sharply with\r\n1660, but belong at least a decade earlier. The chief women writing\r\nand studying between 1650 and 1675,[510] the Duchess of Newcastle,\r\nMrs. Philips, Mary North, Dorothy Osborne, Margaret Blagge, Lady\r\nPakington, the Countess of Warwick, Mrs. Hutchinson, and Lady\r\nFanshawe, brilliantly ushered in this new period. With the coming\r\nof peace and national security women were apparently conscious not\r\nonly of a new freedom, but of a new power and a new demand for some\r\nform of personal expression. After the unusual services rendered by\r\nthem in war-times they could not settle down at once into the tame\r\nconcerns of peace. This does not refer particularly to the women\r\ncounted the heroines of the Civil War. It refers rather to the\r\ngeneral emotional excitement and freeing of the spirit consequent on\r\nwar activities. There was on the part of women a blind and unfocused\r\nbut persistent and stimulating sense that larger and more varied\r\nopportunities were awaiting them. Latent powers had been stirred\r\ninto self-consciousness and could not again be lulled into the old\r\nquiescence.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the inevitable burdens and responsibilities of war\r\nthat had stirred women to new life. They could not fail to share\r\nin the new sense of personal importance and power that came to the\r\npeople as a whole in their victorious struggle with autocracy. But\r\nit must be observed that along with this consciousness of national\r\nand political self-realization there was, under the Puritans, stern\r\nrepression in matters of social and religious life. At the coming of\r\nCharles, however, all this was changed. With disastrous suddenness\r\npeople found themselves free to follow with all gayety of spirit\r\nwherever their pleasure-loving instincts led. That such breaking of\r\nbonds resulted in an almost incredible outburst of immorality should\r\nnot be allowed to obscure the fact that there was also a remarkable\r\nfreeing of the mind from conventional standards. For good or for evil\r\nthe individual found himself free to give energetic expression to his\r\nindividual tendencies. By this freedom, by this license, women as\r\nwell as men were profoundly moved.\r\n\r\nThe new impulses thus brought into being did not, however, give\r\nrise to anything like orderly and progressive activity on the part\r\nof women. The century following 1660 is seen to be an inchoate\r\nassemblage of beginnings. It is rich with a promise that comes to no\r\ndecisive result. The path, instead of leading to some well-marked\r\nfortress or to some mount of vision, loses itself in unmeaning\r\nmeanders.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, after the middle of the eighteenth century, even\r\nan appearance of retrogression in the attention devoted to learned\r\npursuits for women. It is not till the end of that century that\r\nthe movement acquires new momentum. Until we come to Catharine\r\nMacaulay, the novelists in the last quarter of the century, and Mary\r\nWollstonecraft at its end, we have little that is new in theory or\r\nstriking in achievement. From 1760 to 1775 no new woman writer of\r\ndistinction appears. On ideals of education and conduct, Dr. James\r\nFordyce, Mrs. Barbauld, and Mrs. Chapone, the recognized arbiters,\r\nare tame compilers of bromidic maxims with little of the dignity and\r\nspirit of the best writers on feminism six or seven decades earlier.\r\nThe actual accomplishment of the period before 1760 was a destruction\r\nof old placidities, a restlessness of discussion, rather than a\r\nmovement reaching definite achievement. But this discussion and the\r\nmany individual examples of literary or learned accomplishment on the\r\npart of women were together slowly having their collective effect.\r\nFinally salons came and gave social prestige to the women who could\r\nthink and talk brilliantly, and gave a tremendous impetus, if not\r\nto actual learning, yet to the idea that a woman should have sense,\r\nintelligence, a wide knowledge of books, and an understanding of\r\nhistory and current affairs.\r\n\r\nFrom Catharine Macaulay to about the time of Tennyson's _Princess_\r\nis a period possessing considerable unity and one that would reward\r\nminute study. Such an investigation would bring us close to the\r\nestablishment of great schools for the higher education of women and\r\ntheir consequent entrance upon a new era, an era that should look\r\nback with astonishment and respect to such ancestors as Anna van\r\nSchurman, Bathsua Makin, Dr. Hickes, and Mary Astell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The learned woman and a public]\r\n\r\nOne of the most promising characteristics of the work of women is\r\nthe emergence of learning from the aristocratic seclusion of the\r\n\"golden age.\" In Tudor times it was in courtly circles only that\r\nlearning was counted appropriate for women. Elizabeth Lucar stands\r\nas a solitary record of a lady from the wealthy middle class whose\r\naccomplishments were similar to those in the palaces of the great.\r\nBut a significant change is to be noted in the century initiated\r\nabout 1660. Duchesses and countesses are listed with wives and\r\ndaughters of the clergy, of rich merchants, of needy tradesmen. From\r\nthe Duchess of Newcastle to Mary Leapor, the gardener's daughter, the\r\nroll shows that aristocratic restrictions are no longer in full force\r\nin the realm of letters. In intimate connection with this change is\r\nthe fact that authorship is no longer a private, home affair. The\r\ndays when Margaret Roper was praised because she found her father and\r\nhusband a sufficient audience had passed forever. The work of women\r\nwas no longer a carefully tended flower of the hot-house. It must\r\ngrow in the open. To be sure, women hesitated to publish. The Orindas\r\nand Astræas and Philomelas and Ardelias, whom Richardson derides as\r\n\"the lovely dastards\" of the sex, show how women sought protecting\r\npseudonyms. But publish they did. They craved readers. The applauding\r\nmales of their households were no longer adequate. Under the spell of\r\na thousand traditional timidities and reluctancies they yet desired\r\nto see their words on the printed page, and they secretly coveted a\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, women were thinking of authorship as a tool and as\r\na weapon, not merely as a private resource. Mrs. Behn, the first\r\nEnglish woman to write definitely for money, was but the precursor\r\nof various women in succeeding years who came to regard the products\r\nof their minds as of pecuniary significance. Especially is this true\r\ntowards the end of the period. When we find Mrs. Haywood and Mrs.\r\nManley writing fiction of a sort that will sell, Mrs. Blackwell\r\ndoing superb botanical work in order to pay the fine imposed on her\r\nhusband, or Mrs. Collyer writing that she may supplement a meager\r\nincome and educate her children, we may not have come upon great\r\nart or literature, but we have come upon a new idea for women, the\r\npossible economic value of their work. It was not an idea that\r\nreached any but the most meager fruition, but at least the seed of a\r\nnew thought was sown.\r\n\r\nA third change was a respect for literature as a weapon, sometimes\r\nof offense, but mainly of defense and propaganda. The women who had\r\nideals to promulgate, causes to urge upon the indifferent, or evils\r\nto be meliorated, found that talking at home was weak and futile.\r\nThey must secure a public, and so the pamphlets poured forth. In\r\nfact, the fundamental difference between the golden age of the\r\nTudors and the much less agreeable period for learned women after\r\nthe Restoration was this matter of a public. Learning for home\r\nconsumption only and as an elegant resource was sterile. However\r\nfeeble intrinsically, learning and letters used for a purpose and\r\nsubmitted to a public had within it the seeds of vitality and the\r\npromise of a future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Large number of intellectual women]\r\n\r\nOf greater significance still is the large number of women who\r\ngave themselves to intellectual pursuits. From Mrs. Philips to\r\nMrs. Collyer the roll is impressively long. Macaulay's statement\r\nconcerning the illiteracy of the women of the period may have\r\nsome justification, but the exceptions are so numerous as almost\r\nto disprove the rule. And all the way down the line there is the\r\nsuggestion that many other women of like tastes and attainments\r\nhave been lost in obscurity. Many extant productions have\r\nbeen preserved only by chance. Dorothy Osborne's letters, the\r\nbiographies by Mrs. Hutchinson and Lady Fanshawe, Celia Fiennes's\r\ntravels, Lady Winchilsea's grand folio, to name but a few, escaped\r\ndestruction mainly through the undisturbed continuity of the family\r\nlife, and possibly the inertia, of their possessors. And where a\r\nfew manuscripts have been saved, many more have doubtless been\r\ndestroyed. The loss to learning and letters is probably slight.\r\nBut in estimating the strength of a tendency the numbers who were\r\naffected by it count as important testimony. Every woman whose\r\nmind was alert, demanding intellectual sustenance, and struggling\r\ntowards self-expression, adds a further fraction of proof as to the\r\nvitality of the new impulse. And, while not susceptible of absolute\r\nverification, the general tantalizing consciousness of many shadowy\r\npresences of women whose ideas and efforts never reached the printed\r\npage is a not unimportant factor in one's personal conviction as to\r\nthe very large number of women who were affected by the new unrest\r\nand the new aspiration hidden away under the ordinary routine of\r\nthought and work. But even without any such shadowy presences the\r\nlist is long enough to be convincing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Types of work but scantily represented]\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to tabulate the variety of ways in which women sought\r\nself-expression, we note first those fields of endeavor in which\r\ntheir work was but scantily represented. In some cases these areas of\r\nrestricted productivity are characteristic of the age in general, in\r\nsome cases, the outcome of limitations imposed on women in particular.\r\n\r\nOne type of the woman interested in letters becomes practically\r\nnon-existent in the period under discussion, and that is the\r\npatroness whose rank and wealth and intellectual tastes summoned\r\nabout her a brilliant coterie of poets and men of science to whom\r\nshe extended substantial aid. The patroness plays no important part\r\nin English life after Elizabethan times. Lady Bedford is the last\r\nnoted representative. Mary North's little circle of literary ladies,\r\nand the Matchless Orinda's \"Circle of Friendship\" are coteries, but\r\nwithout a Lady Bountiful as the center. Lady Pakington comes nearer\r\nthe type in her assemblage of Church of England divines. But on\r\nthe whole the patroness and salon are not revived till the time of\r\nthe _bas bleus_ in the mid-eighteenth century, and then only in a\r\nmodified form.\r\n\r\nIn the fine arts the attainments of women were slight and amateurish.\r\nMary Beale was the only portrait-painter of distinction, and in\r\nlandscape-painting no woman is represented by valuable canvases.\r\nBut the same state of affairs held true of English men. With the\r\nsolitary exception of Mr. Riley all of the noted portrait-painters\r\nin England before 1760 were foreigners. The landscape artists, too,\r\nwere foreigners, or were mere copiers of the Italian or Flemish\r\nmasters. So the deficiency of women in the fine arts may justly be\r\ncounted but a part of the general national deficiency. The immediate\r\nand permanent success of women on the stage has been sufficiently\r\nemphasized. But it should also be noted that acting was a career\r\nnecessarily limited to a comparatively small number of women.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of work more or less professional in character were but\r\nslightly represented. Except for governesses in great families and\r\nthe mistresses of boarding-schools for girls there were no women\r\nteachers, hence teaching as an ultimate goal was eliminated as a\r\ndetermining factor in the kind of intellectual work pursued. Even the\r\ngovernesses were not chosen for scholarship, but for character and\r\ngood-breeding. They had to do only with little children, and had no\r\nneed for learning. And the school-mistresses secured outside masters\r\nfor the various studies and accomplishments, confining their own work\r\nto morals and general management.\r\n\r\nWomen had so long had home medicaments to make and administer, the\r\nmistress of a great estate had so long been the sole resort in\r\nmatters concerning the health of her dependents, that we might\r\nexpect medicine to be one of the first important new fields conquered\r\nby women, but such was not the case. The Duchess of Newcastle, to\r\nbe sure, gave her fancy free rein in the wide fields of anatomy and\r\nphysiology. But besides such young women as Elizabeth Bury, renowned\r\nfor her knowledge of simples and her skill in diagnosis, and Jane\r\nBarker who followed her brother's lead in reading medical works,\r\nthere are no English women on record before 1760 as having given\r\nthemselves with any serious interest to the study of medicine. The\r\nonly possible exception would be in midwifery. In this department of\r\nmedical or surgical practice women had the matter almost in their own\r\nhands. Mrs. Pilkington says that her father, Dr. Van Lewen, was the\r\nfirst man midwife in England. There must, then, have been developed\r\namong women considerable knowledge and practical skill. But their\r\nwork was in no sense of professional rank. There was no definite\r\ntraining required, there was no way of applying standardized tests of\r\nexcellence, and there was no organization among the women themselves.\r\nAnd almost no women attempted to put into book form the results of\r\ntheir experience. Mrs. Jane Sharp's _The Midwives' Book_ (1671) is a\r\nsolitary exception. Mrs. Cellier's book advocating the maintenance\r\nof a \"Corporation of Skilful Midwives\" is the only suggestion I have\r\nfound looking towards professional training and recognition such as\r\nnurses now receive.\r\n\r\nIn housekeeping matters women were also in the main content to do the\r\nwork without any formal statements of the mysteries of their art.\r\nThere was much passing about of receipts for cookery, for toilet\r\npreparations, for curative drinks and salves, but when these were\r\ncollected and published, it was usually the work of some enterprising\r\nbook-seller. Mrs. Hannah Woolley, Mrs. \"A. M.,\" and Mrs. Hannah\r\nGlasse, are the only women I have come upon who could even in the\r\nfaintest way foreshadow the great mass of present-day writing on\r\nquestions of domestic science.\r\n\r\nAlthough the satire in some of the comedies would indicate that women\r\nwere manifesting some interest in the new discoveries through the\r\ntelescope and the microscope, and were sometimes giving themselves\r\nto laboratory experiments in dissection, there is no serious record\r\nof any real research in science by women. Even Mrs. Blackwell's\r\nexquisite and accurate botanical work is an artistic rather than\r\na scientific achievement so far as she herself is concerned.\r\nHer botanical facts were not entirely the result of personal\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nTo be \"the breeders of children in their low age\" had always been\r\nso unquestionably the province of women that they would supposedly\r\nbe past-masters in that art, and it might be expected that they\r\nwould use the first freedom of their pen to write such things as\r\nwould suit the tastes and needs of children. Again, such is not the\r\ncase. But it must be recognized that there was nowhere any catering\r\nto the literary needs of children. Bunyan's _Book for Boys and\r\nGirls_ (1680), Mason's _Little Catechism_ (1693), Watts's _Divine\r\nand Moral Songs for Children_ (1720) represent a few attempts to\r\nrender religious truth more palatable to the child's mind, but real\r\nliterature for children did not begin till 1744. Mr. Newberry's\r\n_Little Pretty Pocket Book_ of that year initiated a kind of\r\nliterature the vast extent of which can now hardly be estimated. And\r\nin the earliest period of literature for children Mrs. Collyer's\r\n_Christmas Box_ and Miss Fielding's _Little Female Academy_, both in\r\n1749, must take an honorable place.\r\n\r\nOne more kind of work for which women have manifested exceptional\r\nability in modern times is in the conduct of humanitarian\r\nenterprises. Traditionally they were the loaf-givers. The new thing\r\nwas to organize generosity into permanent efficiency and to make it\r\noperative beyond the limits of the family estate. Mrs. Bovey and\r\nLady Elizabeth Hastings are early instances of women devoting time,\r\nmentality, and money to the development of systematic benevolence.\r\nBut there were few women whose economic independence and sense of\r\ncivic responsibility were so happily united.\r\n\r\nStill another realm in which women to-day are finding large\r\nopportunity was practically closed to the women of earlier times,\r\nand that is public speaking. Except among the Quakers no woman spoke,\r\non any subject whatsoever, before an audience. She might sing or she\r\nmight act with applause. But talking was outside her bounds. Acting\r\nwas but repeating the words of others; singing was a gift of the\r\ngods; but talking to an audience, whether to delight or instruct,\r\ncarried plain implications of self-conscious superiority in knowledge\r\nor power. It was incredibly unfeminine and not to be endured. On this\r\ntopic the authority of St. Paul was still unquestioned.\r\n\r\nIf from the women who are to-day preparing for some sort of\r\nprofessional work, we should exclude all who expect to teach, all\r\nwho are planning to enter upon some sort of scientific research,\r\nall who are training themselves for public speaking, all who are\r\npreparing for the effective management of large enterprises, all who\r\nare writing on domestic or medical matters, the scope of feminine\r\nactivity would be almost unbelievably narrowed. These various kinds\r\nof work are now recognized channels through which whatever ability\r\na woman may have may find expression. But in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries if a woman had a good mind and felt impelled\r\nto use it, none of these avenues were normally open to her. It is\r\ndifficult to imagine what the withdrawal of all these opportunities\r\nwould mean in the reduction of adequate stimuli to good work. Hence\r\nthe few women who did pioneer work in these various departments must\r\nhave been moved by some strong urgency of the spirit. They were\r\nadventurers lured by the fascination of the new and the untried,\r\nand their effort is significant even when the region they conquered\r\nproved to be but the barren edge of a great continent.\r\n\r\nIt was in writing that women were least hampered, and, as has been\r\nstated, it was in writing that we find their work most varied and\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Women playwrights]\r\n\r\nAs playwrights they were especially successful in comedy. Mrs. Behn\r\nand Mrs. Centlivre take a very creditable rank in the comedy of\r\nlively intrigue and social satire. Tragedy appealed to more women\r\nwriters than did comedy, but they were less successful in that\r\nrealm. Tragedy was considered so inherently virtuous that the most\r\nhigh-minded could find in it edification, and young girls who were\r\nforbidden attendance on comedies were freely allowed to witness\r\ntragedies. For this reason women writers with dramatic aspirations,\r\nbut to whom the license of the comedy was distasteful, applied\r\nthemselves to tragedy. That Catherine Cockburn's _Fatal Friendship_\r\nshould be counted the best of these tragedies is perhaps a sufficient\r\ncondemnation of the entire series. But it must be again remembered\r\nthat it was not an age in which any writers excelled in tragedy. The\r\nheroic plays of Dryden, the domestic tragedy of Otway, and here and\r\nthere a play of some contemporary vogue, such as Ambrose Philips's\r\n_Distressed Mother_ and Addison's _Cato_, practically make up the\r\nlist. Of the tragedies recorded by Genest between 1660 and 1760\r\nvery few of those having any but the most ephemeral success are by\r\ncontemporary authors. Hence the failure of women in this realm is in\r\naccordance with the trend of the times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fiction]\r\n\r\nNovels did not come into existence till so late in the period under\r\ndiscussion that we have little chance to test women in this field\r\nwhich later proved to be peculiarly their own. Mrs. Behn's romances,\r\nwith their realistic detail, their high-wrought emotions, scenic\r\nsetting, and didactic intent, gave early examples of what might be\r\ndone. But it is not till after Richardson that women had conspicuous\r\nsuccess in works of fiction. After Mrs. Behn and before 1760 we have\r\nonly the scandalous annals of Mrs. Manley and Mrs. Haywood, Miss\r\nBarker's inchoate autobiographic tales, Mrs. Lennox's satiric novel,\r\nand the didactic stories of Mrs. Collyer and Miss Fielding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poetry]\r\n\r\nIn an age when facile versifying was counted a gentleman's\r\naccomplishment, and when the heroic couplet offered a form in which\r\nmechanical precision could be tested by the rule of the thumb, it\r\nwould be strange if women with some literary knack did not write\r\npoetry. And it is true that nearly every woman who wielded a pen\r\ntrained it sometimes into the conventional pindarics or heroics. But\r\non the whole, with most women writers poetry was but an occasional\r\nresource. It was not their chosen _métier_. There were, in fact, but\r\ntwo women, Mrs. Philips and Lady Winchilsea, who took their stand on\r\npoetry as their life's achievement. Orinda had grace, tenderness,\r\nand fine feeling. Ardelia had subtlety of intuition, a delicate\r\nindependence of taste, and an occasional high excellence of form and\r\nphrase. By these qualities these two women are marked off from the\r\npoetasters of their day and have some permanent importance. But the\r\nmass of verse by women was undistinguished. It offers, however, some\r\ninteresting general characteristics.\r\n\r\nCompared to the total amount of verse by women, religious verse\r\ntakes an unexpectedly small place. In no case that I can recall\r\nwere a woman's religious poems her best work. The most popular as\r\nwell as the most turgid and commonplace sort of religious writing\r\nwas the Scripture paraphrase. Poems of pure devotion, of prayer\r\nand of praise, are less often found. In such as do occur we might\r\nexpect the personal note, something winged and lyrical. But they\r\nare disappointingly timid and imitative. We have various proofs\r\nthat there was no absolute lack of poignant spiritual conflict and\r\nendeavor during this period, but religious emotion was apparently so\r\naccustomed to decorous forms that it could not be driven into the\r\nnakedness of soul consequent upon religious abasement or ecstasy.\r\nThe best religious verse of the period avoids strong emotions. It\r\nconsists of gentle moralizing touched by personal feeling. There is\r\na note of genuineness in the emphasis on fortitude, on self-control\r\nand self-abnegation, and on melancholy endurance. But the most that\r\ncan be said for the religious poetry by women is that it was about\r\non a par with contemporary religious poetry by men. It was an age of\r\nstrong church affiliations and of theological discussion, but it was\r\nnot an age that invited the expression of fervent religious emotion.\r\n\r\nThere is also little genuine love poetry. There is much that is\r\nfriendly and affectionate, but almost nothing that is impassioned.\r\nThis, however, is a negation applicable to all verse of the period.\r\nFew memorable love lyrics are to be found in English verse between\r\nWaller's _Go, lovely rose_, and the songs of Robert Burns. But women\r\nhad been so long emancipated from reason and traditionally given\r\nover to the feelings that love poetry, at least of the sentimental\r\nvariety, might have been thought their natural output. As a matter of\r\nfact, the case was quite otherwise. The poetry by women had not, in\r\ngeneral, what would be termed a feminine tone. Women do not seem to\r\nhave given their instincts free play when they took up the poetical\r\nquill. Poetry was either a trifling temporary resource or it was a\r\nserious, even solemn affair, and must concern itself with weighty\r\nmatters of vice and virtue. The style in poetry is consequently much\r\nless effective than in prose. There is almost nowhere through all the\r\nmass of this verse any brightness of fancy, any playfulness of wit,\r\nany mollifying sense of humor. There is little lightness of touch,\r\nthere are few felicities and unforgettable lines. And there is more\r\nof scorn, indignation, and didacticism than of sweetness and light.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Autobiography and letters]\r\n\r\nIn various departments of prose women writers reached an excellence\r\nconsiderably above the general prose average of the time. This is\r\nespecially true in certain rather new branches of writing. The\r\nfragments of autobiography that have come down to us are almost\r\nwithout exception fresh, unpretentious, and delightful pieces\r\nof work. The records given us by the Duchess of Newcastle, Mrs.\r\nHutchinson, Miss Barker, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Elizabeth Elstob,\r\nand others, simply whet the appetite for more. If Anne Killigrew and\r\nAnne Kingsmill and Bathsua Pell and Lady Elizabeth Hastings, and\r\nvery many other ladies, had left similar records we should have a\r\nlegacy of simple, straightforward, and individual prose worth reams\r\nof pindarics or theological discussions. The intimate personal appeal\r\nof the subject-matter seemed to make for a picturesqueness and homely\r\nvigor of style. The only women who wrote biography--the Duchess of\r\nNewcastle, Lady Fanshawe, and Mrs. Hutchinson--wrote about their\r\nhusbands, so they were, in reality, carrying on the autobiographical\r\nelement. And their success is perhaps due to an intimate knowledge of\r\nthe facts, and a strong personal interest such as had animated the\r\nsketches of their own childhood. At any rate, these three _Lives_\r\nrank in interest with Evelyn's _Mrs. Godolphin_ and Roger North's\r\n_Lives of the Norths_. Letters belong in the same general realm, and\r\noffer some of the most entertaining writing of the period. There are\r\nmany reasons for thinking that letter-writing was a more general\r\nfeminine resource than existing records would indicate. Such letters\r\nas are now extant have been preserved almost by accident. They were\r\nnot counted of contemporary importance and very few of them reached\r\npublication before the nineteenth century. Yet the list is fairly\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\nWe have the letters of Margaret Blagge to Mr. Godolphin; those of\r\nthe Osborne ladies, Dorothy, Martha, and Sarah; Orinda's epistles to\r\nPoliarchus; Mrs. Evelyn's letters to her son's tutor; Mrs. Rowe's\r\nto the Duchess of Somerset; Mrs. Delany's to numerous friends; Miss\r\nTalbot's to Miss Carter; Miss Carter's to a host of correspondents;\r\nMrs. Cockburn's to her lovers and to her niece; and Lady Mary Wortley\r\nMontagu's records from many lands as well as her early letters to\r\nMr. Montagu. As a body of documentary material these letters are\r\ninvaluable. And they are interesting reading. The keen eye for dress\r\nand customs would have qualified some of these ladies for the novel\r\nof manners. There are pungent character sketches and witty comment on\r\nsocial foibles. These letters show often a humor and gayety of spirit\r\nsuch as find entrance into no other forms of feminine writing. And\r\nthe style is almost uniformly easy and natural. Dorothy Osborne's\r\nobjection to stilted and pedantic letters could have been applicable\r\nto few women letter-writers. They had no thought of a public and so\r\nescaped the snare of professionalism in tone. The letters contain\r\nrecords of love and of grief, of moments of vivid emotion, of deep\r\nspiritual experience, of friendships and of hatreds, of hopes and\r\ndespairs, and because all these came from the mind and the heart of\r\nthe writer they are told in a convincing manner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Travels]\r\n\r\nAnother similar realm is that of travels. When women went on tours\r\nthey saw everything that was to be seen. And they set down the\r\ndetails with infinite patience. Celia Fiennes has no literary style\r\nat all, but no other description of England between 1650 and 1760\r\ncontains so much detail worth remembering. She was the most spirited\r\nand indefatigable of travelers, and this intensity of interest found\r\nits way into her book and communicates itself to the reader. Had she\r\nkept her diary with any remotest thought of publication she might\r\nhave been more lucid, but she might also have been less vigorous,\r\nindividual, and picturesque. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's _Turkish\r\nLetters_ created a sensation, as well they might, for as a writer of\r\ntravels she out-distanced all competitors.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of prose writing so far indicated were all animated by\r\npersonal experience and interest. That is certainly one secret\r\nof their charm. And it is to be observed that they are marked by\r\nqualities of observation and analysis later proved natural to\r\nwomen by their success in fiction. But there is another department\r\nof writing less naturally associated with women in which they\r\nwere nevertheless conspicuous for merit, and that is some form of\r\ncontroversial writing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Propaganda]\r\n\r\nWhen women espoused and defended a cause, it was with a heat of\r\npersonal conviction that robbed them of self-consciousness and\r\ncontributed to vigor and animation of style. Even earlier women,\r\nsuch as Anna van Schurman and Mrs. Makin, who felt that to be\r\nconvincing they must show their ability to argue with the most rigid\r\nscholastic apparatus, now and then had passages of high-wrought\r\nfeeling or indignation that burst the trammels of their logical\r\nform, and carry even to modern readers a sense of the intensity of\r\nconviction that moved the writer. Bathsua Pell's _Essay_ in 1673 is\r\nan admirable piece of propagandist writing. No defender of higher\r\neducation in the early days of women's colleges was more pungent\r\nin attack, or tossed off the unmeaning arguments of opponents with\r\nmore contemptuous ease. In writing on the higher education of women\r\nit is with the zeal of an enthusiast that Mary Astell marshals the\r\ndetails of her new scheme. She had thought her plan through to the\r\nend and she describes it with clearness and precision. Its noble\r\npossibilities give rise to seriousness and dignity of style. And when\r\nher mind is overborne by a recognition of the many foolish women\r\nand the scornful men who would render her ideals abortive, she is\r\nroused to passages of energetic satire. She is even acrimonious and\r\nvituperative. There is nothing soft or appealing or feminine about\r\nher work. If she convinces it will not be by the arts of her sex, but\r\nby argument and caustic attack. She does not entreat, she commands\r\nand instructs. The anonymous author of the _Defence_ describes, with\r\nkeen analysis, picturesque phrasing, and gay raillery, the beaux,\r\nthe clodpate squires, the pedants, and the virtuosi of her day. Few\r\ncontemporary satiric portraits are of more penetrating wit. \"Sophia\"\r\nof pamphlet fame carries on the successful propagandist writing.\r\nAnd Lady Winchilsea's one prose essay is indicative of her vigorous\r\npossibilities in speech when her ideas and feelings were involved.\r\nOne point concerning the generally dignified tone of these essays\r\nin defense of women should be noted, and that is that they were not\r\nthe outcome of personally bitter experiences or disappointments on\r\nthe part of the authors. The writing was informed rather by a sense\r\nof high civic idealism and responsibility. Though the advancement of\r\nwomen is presented as a matter of justice, and of importance to women\r\nas individuals, the arguments always turn to a larger conception, and\r\nthat is the service rendered to Society and the Church by educated\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious experience and controversy]\r\n\r\nIn religious controversy, also, women excelled. A practical or\r\npersonal cause was not imperative. They wrote with equal vehemence,\r\nsincerity, and will to convince, when they were defending an abstract\r\nprinciple as when they were protesting against injustice, or trying\r\nto further some specific reform. Lady Masham, Susanna Hopton, Mary\r\nAstell, and Mrs. Cockburn sufficiently illustrate the success of\r\nwomen as disputants. The fact that nearly all the topics on which\r\nthese religious controversialists wrote are now dead issues, and that\r\nthe writing has inevitably passed into oblivion along with the ideas\r\nit championed, should not be allowed to obscure the very evident\r\ncontemporary respect accorded women as redoubtable antagonists and\r\nable advocates. There were also women who wrote little, such as Lady\r\nPakington and Lady Conway, to whom the best men of the day gave\r\nhigh esteem for the soundness of their patristic and philosophical\r\nlearning, and for the acuteness of their thinking.\r\n\r\nWriters on personal religious experience or on hortatory subjects\r\ndo not reach so high a grade of work. The prodigious industry of\r\nvarious compilers, annotators, and note-takers--the true Church of\r\nEngland \"sermon-tasters\"--such as Lady Brooke and Lady Halkett, is\r\nless indicative of learning than of a pronounced religious bias. And\r\nin prose, as in verse, the free and natural expression of spiritual\r\nexperience was not characteristic of the age.\r\n\r\nThat more of this controversial and religious writing was not\r\npublished can hardly be counted a loss to literature. Religious\r\nmeditations quicken the inner life, and the effort to put religious\r\nemotions and beliefs into some literary form must contribute to\r\na more active mentality, but the resultant printed page is not\r\nnecessarily of permanent interest. The ardors and acrimonies, the\r\nlabyrinthine twisting of arguments, the niceties of interpretation,\r\nthe array of authorities, are all a leaden weight to the modern\r\nreader. And most meditations on virtues and vices are hardly more\r\nstimulating. But we cannot pass the great mass of these religious\r\nwritings without noting what a new impression they give us of social\r\nEngland, especially in the second half of the seventeenth century.\r\nA student of Restoration comedy sees the court of England in its\r\nmost frivolous and morally repellent aspect. But these women whose\r\nminds were so set on religion were all members of the aristocracy.\r\nMargaret Blagge, Anne Killigrew, and Anne Kingsmill, women of the\r\nmost sincere and ardent piety, were in intimate association with\r\nthe courts of Charles II and James II. Lady Pakington, Lady Brooke,\r\nLady Halkett, Lady Masham, Lady Russell, Mary Astell, Lady Elizabeth\r\nHastings, and, later, Lady Huntington, were all by rank or especial\r\nopportunity in the highest and most exclusive social circles and so\r\nin contact with the profligacy of the court. Their extreme assiduity\r\nin all matters of religion, in church attendance, in private prayer,\r\nin meditation, in self-examination, in their austere moral standards,\r\nwere a violent reaction from the evil life about them. In the homes\r\nand small social circles where their influence could be felt was\r\nbeing prepared a body of moral indignation, a desire for uprightness\r\nand purity of life, that gave to Jeremy Collier's attack on the stage\r\nin 1698 so overwhelming a response, and that was the sustaining force\r\nback of the Societies for the Reformation of Manners in the late\r\nseventeenth and early eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Work of women compared with contemporary work by men]\r\n\r\nThe writing done by women between 1660 and 1760 is more impressive\r\nfrom its amount and variety than from any high excellence of\r\nits component parts. A mere calling of the great names of the\r\nperiod--Milton, Bunyan, Dryden, Swift, Pope, Addison, and Steele--is\r\nadequate to show that no woman of the time is comparable to these men\r\nin mental stamina and energy, or in deft literary manipulation. The\r\ndramatic work by women presents no such brilliant social satire as we\r\nfind in Etherege and Wycherley, no wit so penetrating and sparkling\r\nas in Congreve's _Way of the World_, no humor so innocent and likable\r\nas in Steele's _Tender Husband_. In poetry Orinda and Ardelia make\r\nbut a poor showing beside the giants of the day. There are no women\r\nwriters on literary criticism even approaching the mastery of Dryden.\r\nThere are no essayists with the light touch and social ease of\r\nAddison and Steele. There are no novelists to be ranked with Defoe,\r\nRichardson, and Fielding.\r\n\r\nThese rather damaging negations amount, however, in the final\r\nanalysis, only to a statement that among the comparatively small\r\nnumber of women writers no one reached the pre-eminence of the eight\r\nor ten most distinguished literary men. But the same statement\r\ncould be made concerning the crowd of men striving for success in\r\nauthorship. Of most men it could be said that their best endeavors\r\nleft wide unconquered fields between them and the elect. It is,\r\nindeed, much to say of women that, untrained, with no stimulus of\r\nmoney or fame, a considerable number of them yet attained to an\r\nhonorable place in writers of a class below the best, and that\r\nin some realms such as autobiography, biography, travels, and\r\nletter-writing, and in writing inspired by some social reform, some\r\npropaganda of religion or ethics, they rank among the best of their\r\ntime. The same may be said of their work in pure scholarship. Miss\r\nElstob, Miss Carter, and Mrs. Collyer, in their respective fields of\r\nAnglo-Saxon, Greek, and German, were exact and thorough beyond the\r\ndemands of contemporary standards.\r\n\r\nBut even if there were not many successes to record, the great amount\r\nof work done by women would still carry its own sort of proof.\r\nIn establishing the existence of a tendency it is not the single\r\nbrilliant example, the genius, the persons of extraordinary ability,\r\nthat count. It is rather the aims, ambitions, attempts, of many\r\npersons variously striving in the same general direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comedy an embodiment of current opinion]\r\n\r\nThe general seventeenth and eighteenth century opinion concerning\r\nlearned women finds fairly complete statement in contemporary\r\ncomedy. The persistence of the learned lady as a comic type serves\r\nincidentally as corroborative proof of the increasing attention given\r\nby women to learned pursuits, for no stage type remains amusing from\r\nyear to year unless personages at least moderately correspondent to\r\nthe type exist in sufficient numbers to count as a factor in social\r\nlife. A basis of reality is necessary to give the type currency. But\r\nthe comedy is more important as voicing a general critical estimate\r\nof values. A character does not hold its own as a comic type unless\r\nto the mass of theater-goers it presents itself as out of focus\r\nwith common sense. A moral or social judgment is implied. The laugh\r\nthat followed Biddy Tipkin and Polly Honeycomb and Lydia Languish\r\nwas a recognition of the absurdity involved in regulating real life\r\nby the rules of romance, and the underlying protest against too free\r\naccess to fiction was quite in line with the diatribes of various\r\ngrave moralists. So, too, with the learned lady. The comic character\r\ngained its point from the assumption on the part of the playwright\r\nand the audience that there was a fundamental incongruity between\r\nthe lady and her learning. Learning did not belong to the lady, and\r\nwhen she assumed it she was thereby justly betrayed into all sorts\r\nof humiliations and absurdities. Back of every picture there was,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, the critical judgment. Learning and\r\nladies do not coalesce. Either the lady abandons the learning or the\r\nlearning spoils the lady.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of learned ladies represented in the comedy. In\r\nthe case of young, lovely, and well-dowered girls, learning was but\r\na foible. When convinced of its absurdity, these desirable maidens\r\nput aside their big folios and became the properly humble, adoring,\r\nand ignorant wives of the heroes whose sound good sense had shown\r\nthem their folly. The unpleasanter elements of the comic portraits\r\nbelong to dissatisfied wives whose souls were still bent on amorous\r\nadventure; to obsolescent ladies unwilling to confess the decay of\r\ntheir charms; to the old and the homely whom no bravery of attire\r\nand no battery of glances and graces could restore to the marriage\r\nmarket. To ladies of both classes Platonism is a name to conjure\r\nwith. All physical manifestations of love are abhorrent to them. The\r\nmystic union of souls is as much as the truly refined can tolerate.\r\nTo the young learned ladies this doctrine of austerity has at first a\r\ngenuine appeal, but is quickly proved impracticable and fallacious.\r\nTo the other ladies virtue is but a screen to mask their discredited\r\ncharms.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the learned ladies is as spurious as their virtue.\r\nThey profess an intimate knowledge of Latin and Greek, and French\r\nseems their native tongue. They are at ease in the jargon of\r\nphilosophical systems. They follow the telescope with the ardor of\r\nthe Royal Society itself. Their studies are full of mathematical\r\nbooks and instruments. The scalpel and microscope lead them along\r\nthe path of anatomical research. But in all this parade of learning\r\nthere is no real scholarship. The ladies are pretentious and\r\nconceited, flaunting their false Latin and Greek before all comers,\r\nclaiming to have explored the depths of knowledge when their short\r\nswallow-flights have scarcely brushed the surface.\r\n\r\nThe comedy may be said to embody the ordinary view as to the\r\nunsuitableness of learning for women. This implied critical negation\r\nis given a positive analogue in the actual training given to girls.\r\nTheir early education was not neglected as is shown by the numbers of\r\nmasters and tutors provided for the young daughters of good families.\r\nAnd from six to fourteen many girls were sent to the numerous\r\nboarding schools for young misses. But whether at home or in school\r\nthe teaching included little more than deportment, accomplishments,\r\nand housewifery. These were what, in the language of Mr. Verney,\r\nwould render a girl \"considerable in the eyes of God and man.\" Hannah\r\nWood's school was the most advanced of these minor schools for girls,\r\nand Sarah Fielding's _Little Female Academy_ depicts the best that\r\nwas done for younger girls. In any case education apparently ceased\r\nat fifteen or sixteen.\r\n\r\nThe schools provided for girls represent what it was in general\r\nthought that they needed. The comedy represents the absurdity of\r\ntrying to pass these limits. Confirmatory of these views would\r\nbe many private expressions by both men and women. There were,\r\nof course, hundreds of intelligent men to whom any change in the\r\nstatus of women seemed hostile to the best interests of society. And\r\nthere were hundreds of women who flouted all thoughts of learning\r\nas essentially, eternally unfeminine. _The Spectator_ records that\r\nat a certain period in the court of France it was counted a mark\r\nof ill-breeding to pronounce hard words right and that ladies not\r\ninfrequently took occasion to use such words \"that they might show\r\na Politeness in murdering them.\" And the diatribes in the English\r\nfeminist pamphlets from Bathsua Makin to \"Sophia\" show how many women\r\nin high circles boasted of ignorance as one of their charms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advanced opinions of a minority]\r\n\r\nBut we come to quite a different state of affairs when we consider\r\nthe opinions of the progressive minority. The proposed schemes for\r\nhigher education, although without immediate practical result, are\r\nnotable indications of a new era of thought. Bathsua Makin's was\r\nthe first formulated plan. But her effort to graft new fruit on the\r\nold stock resulted in a singular mixture. Her impassioned desire to\r\ninduct girls into the excellencies of higher learning was hampered\r\nin various ways. She could not lessen the attention paid to the\r\naccomplishments; she could not venture to push the school age beyond\r\nsixteen; and she could not make her beloved linguistics compulsory.\r\nWhat she did accomplish was not in the establishment of an ordered\r\nsystem. It was rather the impress of her tastes and advanced ideas on\r\nthe minds of individual pupils. The girls who went from the Tottenham\r\nHigh Cross School to various distinguished homes in England had no\r\nalarmingly fluent or exact knowledge of Latin, Greek, or Hebrew. But\r\nthey had all at least been invited to look within the portals of the\r\npalace of learning and some had found it rich and alluring. To all\r\nhad come a new conception of the learning possible to women. Mrs.\r\nMakin's court prestige, her reputation for prodigious scholastic\r\nattainments, her courage, originality, and independence, made her a\r\ndignified and an authoritative figure. It is a matter of regret that\r\nfull annals of her school were not preserved.\r\n\r\nThe education proposed by Dr. Hickes in his remarkable sermon in\r\n1683, ten years after Mrs. Makin established her school, was not\r\nanalyzed into details. But when he suggested for women seminaries of\r\nlearning similar to Oxford and Cambridge with only such changes in\r\nthe instruction and the regimen as might be found advisable to fit\r\nthem for their lives as women, and when he urged rich and childless\r\nwomen to make their wealth serve humanity by founding such colleges\r\nfor girls, he was too far ahead of his time to meet any immediate\r\npractical response, or even any opposition.\r\n\r\nThe next plan came from Mary Astell. This was a matured scheme.\r\nHer college was to be a sort of conventual retreat without vows\r\nand with an emphasis on the intellectual as well as the religious\r\nlife. Publicity, college honors, degrees, were not thought of.\r\nThere were to be no required studies, nor does she suggest even an\r\norderly progression of lectures. The heterogeneous character of her\r\nproposed clientèle forbade any rigidity of plan. Mary Astell seems\r\nto have looked about her and found many women to whom the customary\r\nrégime offered no satisfactory place. There were widows who did not\r\nchoose remarriage, spinsters unwelcome in the homes allotted them\r\nby kinship, girls with dowries too slender to make an advantageous\r\nmarriage probable, young heiresses subject to the too adventurous\r\npursuit of impecunious lovers and so in need of a haven pending\r\nmarriage. All these uncoördinated needs were to be met by the new\r\ninstitution. The plan was to provide agreeable surroundings wherein\r\nwomen could tranquilly and without hostile criticism work out their\r\nown salvation. Practical beneficence, teaching, study in various\r\nrealms, religious meditation, were the avenues open to individual\r\nchoice. To the women who remained permanently in the college a life\r\nof dignified achievement was possible. Upon the young women who were\r\ndestined to be wives and mothers in important homes would be exerted\r\nan influence tending to ennoble them in their domestic relations,\r\nand the learning they had gained would prove a resource amidst the\r\ndistractions and trials of life. The plan included too much, and\r\nthe adjustments rendered necessary by its captivating flexibility\r\nwould have taxed any organizer to the utmost. Perhaps it is as well\r\nthat the scheme was not put to the test of practice. Mary Astell's\r\ncontribution was in the idea she set forth and in her eloquent\r\ndefense of that idea.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that Defoe's plan for a woman's college should have\r\nbeen coincident with Mary Astell's, yet independent of it. Defoe's\r\nfertile imagination creates curious buildings in which to house his\r\nAcademy. He evidently considers Mary Astell's plan as too loose in\r\ngeneral structure and too religious in tone to be practicable. He\r\nnarrows his work down to such studies as are given in public schools.\r\n\r\nAfter Defoe we hear of no further plans for higher education. But\r\nthe idea lingered in the minds of many. Richardson in _Clarissa\r\nHarlowe_ suggests such an institution, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu\r\nsays that it was her youthful ambition to be foundress of a college.\r\nIn Mrs. Centlivre's _Basset Table_ the learned young Valeria is\r\nadvised to found a woman's college in which the pupils shall be\r\ncalled \"Valerians.\" The most curious and interesting embodiment of\r\nthe scheme was that by Thomas Amory. The fullness and realistic\r\nprecision of detail in his account of the \"Hertfordshire Religious\r\nRetirement\" were such as to make his heroine, the foundress, accepted\r\nas an historical personage. The fictitious narrative is, however, of\r\nespecial significance as showing the persistence of Mary Astell's\r\nabortive plan.\r\n\r\nIn complete harmony with these various schemes for giving women\r\ngreater intellectual freedom was the attitude in many private\r\nhomes. It is quite surprising to discover how many studious girls\r\nhad a favorable home environment. Elizabeth Jocelyn's grandfather,\r\na distinguished bishop, conducted her studies. Mary North's father\r\n\"fostered her little assemblage of female _literati_.\" Lady Pakington\r\nwas taught by the learned Sir Norton Knatchbull. Lucy Apsley's father\r\nspurred her on to outdo her brothers in Latin, and Mr. Hutchinson\r\nfell in love with her for her poetry and learning. Dudleya North had\r\nthe same teachers and studies as her brothers until they went to the\r\nUniversity. Damaris Cudworth's mind was her father's joy and pride\r\nand Locke was her tutor. Bishop Burnet provided for his daughter Mary\r\nall possible opportunities in books and art. John Evelyn cherished\r\nthe intellectual tastes of his daughter and showed her writings and\r\npaintings with pride. Anne Baynard, Anna Hume, Elizabeth Singer,\r\nwere girls whose early literary tendencies found paternal approval\r\nand aid. William Elstob gave fullest sympathy and guidance to his\r\nambitious young sister, the _indefessa comes_ of his studies. And\r\nElizabeth Carter's intellectual needs ruled the household.\r\n\r\nThese protected home studies were not unlike the opportunities\r\noffered girls in Tudor times and had the same disadvantages. There\r\nwere no ordered courses of study. The depths and shallows of a girl's\r\nlearning were largely dependent on the tastes of her father or tutor.\r\nShe entered upon such a line of work as offered itself, prepared\r\nherself for it as she went along, and achieved what she could. As\r\ncompensations for a training so desultory were the concentration and\r\nzest of the work, the undisciplined ardor of the pioneer, contact\r\nwith great books and men of well-seasoned learning.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that these scattered homes where the daughter\r\nfound herself free to develop learned tastes were doubtless more\r\nnumerous than is at first apparent. We know of a few such homes\r\nbecause of chance published records. But there must have been many\r\nhomes where the lettered leisure such as we find in the Evelyn\r\nfamily, in Lord Winchilsea's at Eastwell, and in Archbishop Secker's\r\nat Canterbury, was shared in to the fullest extent by the ladies of\r\nthe household. No daughter of the family might attain to notice as a\r\nwriter, but the result of such reading and thinking would be a high\r\nlevel of general intelligence which might, in the mass, be of more\r\nsignificance than authorship.\r\n\r\nMore important still as indicative of a new era is the favor accorded\r\nlearned women by many men of high standing. The adulation given the\r\nDuchess of Newcastle may have been inspired by her rank and wealth,\r\nbut Jeremy Taylor, Cowley, and the Earl of Roscommon had no such\r\nreason for their homage to Orinda. The clergymen who gathered at\r\nLady Pakington's rejoiced in her great learning. Dryden gave to Anne\r\nKilligrew such praise as awaits few poets and artists. The Norths\r\ngave honorable public recognition of Dudleya North's remarkable\r\nlinguistic attainments. The family circle at Eastwell applauded Lady\r\nWinchilsea's poems. Mrs. Blackwell's work received formal recognition\r\nfrom the most learned doctors of the day. Of the early novel-writers\r\nRichardson is so well recognized as the sex's champion, and as the\r\nchampion of learned ladies in particular, that his services need no\r\nfurther emphasis. Fielding's satirical picture of Mrs. Western ends\r\nwith the conclusion that \"petticoats should not meddle,\" but he more\r\nthan turns the scale by the opinions he expresses in the Prefaces to\r\nhis sister's books. Most men of ability preferred as companions women\r\nof good minds and a fair stock of ideas. Even Bishop Burnet, while\r\nafraid of general education, praises the intellectual endowment and\r\nlearned attainments of each of his three wives. And Swift, though\r\ncontemptuous of the race of women, for close comradeship chose\r\nStella, a woman of wit, sense, and learning, in preference to some\r\none of the doll or clinging-vine type. And his amiability, though\r\nrather too condescending, towards various literary ladies, may in\r\npart offset his brutal general statements. The fact is, nearly every\r\nwoman of learned or literary attainments was accorded praise--even an\r\nundue meed of praise--from her immediate circle and from at least a\r\nfew of her distinguished contemporaries.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, publication of worthy work was made a matter of\r\nurgency. Dr. Hickes did all in his power to bring Elizabeth Elstob's\r\nAnglo-Saxon work before the learned public of his day, and it was\r\nhe who insisted on the publication of Susanna Hopton's letters.\r\nLady Masham's _Letters of the Love of God_ were brought out only on\r\nthe insistence of John Norris. Mrs. Cockburn's early philosophical\r\nwritings received immediate praise from Bishop Burnet, John Norris,\r\nand John Locke. But for Archbishop Secker Miss Carter's _Epictetus_\r\nwould have remained in manuscript. It was through Bishop Burnet's\r\ninsistence that his wife's _Meditations_ were published.\r\n\r\nAnd still one more debt must be recorded, for some of the most\r\nimportant books in behalf of women were written by men. From Gerbier\r\nto Ballard the list is an interesting one. No woman ventured on\r\nstatements so astounding as those which Poulain de la Barre deduced\r\nfrom his fundamental assumption of the equality of the sexes. His\r\narguments may have been but an academic pushing of a principle to\r\nits logical conclusion, or his book may even have been satirical\r\nin intent, but the English translation was evidently made in all\r\nseriousness and served as a basis for \"Sophia's\" most audacious\r\nclaims. Specific attempts to bring female genius into knowledge and\r\nrepute were by men. John Duncomb's _Feminead_ in 1751 leads the list,\r\nand before 1760 we have the _Poems by Eminent Ladies_ of Bonnell and\r\nThornton, the _Lives_ by Theophilus Cibber, the exaltation of learned\r\nwomen in _John Buncle_, and, chief of all, the monumental work by\r\nGeorge Ballard.\r\n\r\nIn summary it seems fair to say that while there was a general\r\nopinion adverse to the learning of women and suspicious of it, there\r\nwere yet many men who seriously held views that would not sound\r\nantiquated in any modern defense of the higher education of women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Education in relation to the Church]\r\n\r\nIn all the discussions of plans for the intellectual training of\r\nwomen two suggestive limitations are to be noted. One is that nearly\r\nall men and women who favored the higher education did so because\r\nof the advantage it would be to the Church. The Quakers recognized\r\nthe right of women to speak in public because they believed such\r\naction authorized by the Scriptures, but the freedom so granted did\r\nnot go beyond religious topics. Susanna Wesley's ministry to her\r\nhusband's parishioners was excusable only because her teaching was\r\nin the service of the Church. And the clergymen of high rank who\r\nfavored learned women did so because the piety of these women would\r\nprobably prove more advantageous if it were trained. Even Ballard put\r\nextra emphasis on the ladies who read the Scriptures in Hebrew and\r\nGreek. And it was probably ethical rather than literary standards\r\nthat precluded any mention in his record of women such as Mrs. Behn,\r\nMrs. Manley, and Mrs. Haywood. In all Ballard's many pages I do not\r\nrecall even a hint that his learned ladies could be accused of any\r\nirregularities of life or doctrine. And it is because women are\r\nnaturally devout that Amory chooses learned young ladies to expound\r\nhis new religion.\r\n\r\nThe basis of Bishop Burnet's objection to Mary Astell's college was\r\nthat a body of women thus set apart for learning might conceivably\r\nprove inimical to the Church. The isolated learned lady under the\r\ncharge of some wise husband or father could presumably be guided in\r\nright paths or suppressed. But who could give bonds for a college of\r\nlearned women? It was the attitude towards the Church that turned the\r\nscale against or in favor of higher education. In point of fact, no\r\nwoman--not even the most profligate--wrote against religion. On the\r\ncontrary, all women of letters--even the most profligate--wrote in\r\nfavor of religion. Genuinely, or as a matter of convention, they all\r\nupheld virtue and the authority of the Church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outcome of education not foreseen]\r\n\r\nA second limitation is that the ultimate outcome of any greatly\r\nincreased intellectual freedom for women was but dimly descried.\r\nIf women were permitted to pursue learning into remote fastnesses,\r\nif they were allowed to thread their difficult way through the\r\nentanglements of philosophical disputations, if they were encouraged\r\nto look out upon the follies of life with satiric or reformatory\r\nintent, further steps in independence would seem an inevitable\r\nsequence. But such steps were not only not taken, they were not even\r\nforeseen. Nor did the most advanced men and women make any claims\r\nextending beyond the freedom to read, write, and think according to\r\ntheir own desires. Home duties and relationships remained unchanged.\r\nBathsua Makin said that higher education was not designed to\r\nmake wives self-assertive, but more reasonably and intelligently\r\nsubmissive. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Mary Astell, the two most\r\nadvanced and independent women of their day, are at one with the\r\ntheory of the divinely ordained headship of man. Their bitterness of\r\ntone contains no thought of change, no hint of rebellion. Women were\r\nstill under the dominion of fathers and husbands. The difference was\r\nthat these fathers and husbands were in numerous instances willing\r\nto accord a very much enlarged freedom. But the next step was not\r\ntaken by virtue of which the final right of decision as to her own\r\nthought and action would have belonged to the woman herself.\r\n\r\nThere was, furthermore, no claim made by women for any part in public\r\nlife. Mary Wollstonecraft's suffrage programme of 1791, mild as it\r\nwas, would have seemed to Mary Astell an incredible overturning\r\nof feminine ideals. Mary Astell and her congeners could not see\r\nthat the putting of educational weapons into the hands of women\r\nwas a concession carrying with it all later demands of feminism.\r\nThe advocates of higher education for women were blind to the\r\npotentialities of the situation. There was no immediate following-up\r\nof theory into action. The idea of woman as a self-sufficing,\r\nself-directing individuality, responsible for her own destiny,\r\nand capable of playing an important part in civic and national\r\naffairs, did not come into clear outline until two centuries after\r\nMary Astell's pronunciamento. In the period before 1760 we become\r\naware of a moving on the waters. We are conscious of a great stir\r\nof preparation as for a crisis. Many paths converge towards one\r\ngoal, but no goal is reached. Plans and achievements and favorable\r\nutterances seem to halt in mid-air.\r\n\r\nA detailed study of the various ways in which women sought for\r\nfuller and richer intellectual life shows in what isolation they\r\nworked, with what lack of leadership, with what a depressing sense\r\nof the futility of their uncoördinated efforts. The beginnings of\r\nthe new ideals for women were so modest and unassuming, so casual,\r\nso without self-consciousness, that at the time they could hardly be\r\nrecognized as beginnings. Evidences of a new vitality appear in the\r\nretrospect as numerous and promising, but in reality each thinker of\r\nnew thoughts stood out alone, a solitary champion, scarcely realizing\r\nthat in other parts of the field other champions were fighting under\r\nthe same banners. We can now bring together many rather advanced\r\nstatements in favor of educating girls. But these were often mere\r\npassing isolated utterances. There was nothing like an organized\r\npropaganda, no body of public opinion growing steadily in mass and\r\npower till it became dominant. There are hundreds of blades pushing\r\nup through the dark earth, but the field is never quite ripe for\r\nharvest. There is so much reasoning, so much able thought, so much\r\nsincerity of feeling and aspiration, and there are so many women\r\nreaching out into new mental realms, that a decisive revolution of\r\nopinion seems often imminent. But the world listens unconvinced, and\r\nin the actual affairs of life apparently applies the old standards.\r\n\r\nWhat was actually accomplished in the century before 1760 was a\r\nlavish sowing of seed, a steady infiltration of new ideas, a breaking\r\nup of old certainties as to woman's place in domestic and civic life,\r\nand an accumulation of examples proving women capable of the most\r\nvaried intellectual aptitudes and energies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

In the light of this fact we read\r\nwith interest a comment by De Segur in 1803: \"The English women live\r\nmuch in the same manner as those of Turkey, with the exception of\r\nwalls and keepers. Without being so much overlooked, they suffer\r\nequal constraint. However great the superiority they may be sensible\r\nthey possess above their husbands, they are obliged to respect and\r\nto fear them; and they endeavor to acquire their love as a matter\r\nof necessity. Such is also the lesson they give to their children,\r\nand it may be remarked that they recommend it to them rather as a\r\npolitical measure than as a duty. In fact, they can command only by\r\nobeying; and when it is said that a woman is happier in England than\r\nin any other country, it is only saying that she is prepared, by her\r\neducation, to be more satisfied than another woman with a mediocrity\r\nof happiness.\" (Hill, Georgiana: _Women in English Life_, vol.

In\r\n1790 Mr. G. P. Peckard, Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and\r\nthe husband of a descendant of the Ferrar family, published _Memoirs\r\nof the Life of Mr. Nicholas Ferrar_ (reprinted in Wordsworth's\r\n_Ecclesiastical Biography_, vol. IV). In 1828 and again in 1837\r\nappeared _Brief Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar_, by the Reverend T. M.\r\nMacdonogh (based on an unpublished _Life_ by Bishop Turner, extracts\r\nfrom which had been published in _The Christian Magazine_ in 1761).\r\nAn abridgment of Peckard's _Memoirs_ appeared in 1852. In 1855 came\r\nthe most important of the works on Ferrar. It was _Nicholas Ferrar,\r\nTwo Lives_, by J. E. B. Mayor, Cambridge. The Reverend Thomas\r\nCarter's _Nicholas Ferrar, his Household and Friends_, came out in\r\n1892. In 1880 Mr. J. Henry Shorthouse described Little Gidding in\r\nchapter IV of _John Inglesant_. In 1896 Emma Marshall, in _A Haunt\r\nof Ancient Peace_, also introduced the life of Little Gidding into\r\na fictitious narrative. In 1899 the _Story Books_ of Little Gidding\r\nwere edited by E. C.

As for swearers a man nede not\r\nto seke for thym, for in the Kynges courte and lordes courtes in\r\ncities, borowes and in townes, and in every house, in maner there is\r\nabbominable swerynge, and no man dothe go about to redresse it, but\r\ndoth take swearyng as for no sinne, which is a damnable synne; and\r\nthey the which doth use it, be possessed of the Devill, and no man\r\ncan helpe them but God and the Kynge.\" (Hill, Georgiana: _Women in\r\nEnglish Life_, vol.

Swift's _Polite Conversation_ (1738) bears the same\r\nimplication as to the manners of good society in the first quarter of\r\nthe eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[105] The \"Matchless Orinda\" gives us an inkling of the way some of\r\nthis praise should be discounted. It seems that Waller was reported\r\nto have said that he would give all his own poems to have been the\r\nauthor of a poem written by the Duchess of Newcastle. On being taxed\r\nwith insincerity he answered that he could \"do no less in Gallantry\r\nthan be willing to devote all his own Papers to save the Reputation\r\nof a Lady, and keep her from the Disgrace of having written anything\r\nso ill.\" (_Letters from Orinda to Poliarchus_, Letter XLII.)\r\n\r\n[106] _Life of the Duchess of Newcastle_ (ed.

The use of \"Mrs.\" for all reputable\r\npersons of the female sex, even children, prevailed during the\r\nseventeenth and into the eighteenth century. On the tombstone of\r\nMilton's daughter, a child under six months we read, \"1657. Mar. 20.\r\nMrs. Kathern Milton.\" (_Notes and Queries_, 7th Series, vol. VII,\r\np. 494.) _A Continuation of Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, Written\r\nby a Young Gentlewoman, Miss A. W._ (1651, 2d edition, 1690), is a\r\nstriking exception. There was sometimes a distinction between the\r\nmarried and the unmarried in that the latter had the Christian name\r\nafter the \"Mrs.\" as when Evelyn speaks of \"Mrs. Margaret Blagge,\"\r\nbut this custom was by no means invariable. The prefix \"Miss\" began\r\nsoon after the Restoration to be used as a term of reproach. January\r\n9, 1662, Evelyn says of Roxalana, \"She being taken to be ye Earl of\r\nOxford's _Misse_ (as at this time they began to call lewd women).\"\r\nIn 1669 Flecknoe, in _Epigrams of All Sorts_, wrote a poem to Mary\r\nDavis, the King's mistress, under the title \"To Miss Davis.\" In\r\n1675 appeared \"_The 'Miss' displayed; with all her Wheadling Arts\r\nand circumventions, By the Author of the First Part of the 'English\r\nRogue.'_\" In 1683, in Miss Barber's _Poems_, was a poem entitled \"To\r\nthe Town Miss,\" and in one of her novels (about 1715) she speaks of\r\nthe \"Town Miss\" who pretends to modesty. In 1690 we find the _Dutch\r\nWhore, or, the Miss of Amsterdam_.\r\n\r\n\"Miss\" in a reputable sense belonged to very young girls. In 1675\r\nLady Russell speaks of her daughter Rachel, who was then four years\r\nold, as \"our Miss.\" When the little girl is thirteen her grandfather\r\ncalls her \"Mrs. Rachel.\" (_Lady Russell's Letters_, vol. I, pp.\r\n14, 139.) In 1723, in _The Gentleman Instructed_, we read \"As soon\r\nas Reason begins to sparkle, Miss is led to the drawing-room.\" The\r\nproper age for \"Miss\" seems a little advanced in two quotations made\r\nby Mr. Aitkin (_Life of Steele_, vol. I, p. 162) from _Lillie's\r\nOriginal and Genuine Letters sent to the Tatler and Spectator_.\r\nOne young lady says: \"Being arrived at sixteen I have left the\r\nboarding-school, and now having assumed the title of Madam instead\r\nof Miss am come home.\" A second quotation seems to indicate a still\r\nfurther extension of the proper age for Miss; \"Let no woman after the\r\nknown age of twenty-one presume to admit of her being called Miss\r\nunless she can fairly prove she is not out of her sampler.\"\r\n\r\nActresses were usually called \"Mrs.\" in the bills. The first use\r\nof \"Miss\" that I can find is in 1685 in D'Urfey's _Commonwealth\r\nof Women_, where a part was played by \"Miss Nanny\" (Genest: _Some\r\nAccount of the English Stage_, vol. I, p. 443). In D'Urfey's _Don\r\nQuixote_ Altesidora was played by \"Miss Cross.\" Genest (vol. II, p.\r\n70) says: \"She was called _Miss_ because she was quite a girl ...\r\nshe was afterwards called Mrs. Cross ... the case was the same with\r\nseveral other actresses--Cibber in _The Lady's Last Stake_ calls\r\ntwo of the female characters _Miss_ Notable and _Mrs._ Conquest,\r\ntho' they are both unmarried--but one is a girl and the other a\r\nwoman.\" \"Miss Cross\" was \"Mrs.\" on the bills within a year. \"Miss\r\nYounger\" came into the house at seven years old. Later she became\r\n\"Mrs. Younger.\" So with Miss Mountfort, Miss Santlow, Miss Sherburn,\r\nMiss Booth, Miss Rogers, and other young actresses who entered the\r\ntheatrical profession between 1700-1715.\r\n\r\nBy 1750 \"Miss\" for unmarried women is pretty well established.\r\nThe list of subscribers to Ballard's _Memoirs_ (1752) contains\r\nmany ladies called \"Miss.\" _The Connoisseur_, November 25, 1754,\r\nsaid: \"Every unmarried woman is now called 'Miss.'\" But \"Mrs.\" for\r\nreputable unmarried women beyond girlhood was occasionally used\r\nthrough the century. Elizabeth Carter was always \"Mrs. Carter,\" while\r\nher friend Catharine Talbot, about the same age, was \"Miss Talbot.\"\r\nIn _Humphrey Clinker_ (1771) Tabitha Bramble, though a spinster, is\r\n\"Mrs.\" Sir Walter Scott called Joanna Baillie \"Mrs.\" in the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century. _Notes and Queries_ (7th Series, vol. VII,\r\npp. 104-256) calls attention to the fact that as late as 1889 \"Mrs.\"\r\nwas in many places considered the correct title for upper-class\r\nunmarried female servants.\r\n\r\n[134] Evelyn, John: _Life of Mrs. Godolphin_ (ed.

Dr. Hickes justified the presence of the poor in\r\nthe body politic, as necessary to the very existence of the State:\r\n\r\n\"But this Civil Equality is morally impossible, because no\r\nCommonweal, little or great, can subsist without Poor. They are\r\nnecessary, for the establishment of Superiority, and Subjection\r\nin Humane Societies, where there must be Members of Dishonour, as\r\nwell as Honour, and some to serve and obey, as well as others to\r\ncommand. The Poor are the Hands and Feet of the Body Politick, the\r\n_Gibeonites_ and _Nethinims_ in all Countries, who hew the Wood,\r\nand draw the Water of the Rich. They Plow our Lands, and dig our\r\nQuarries, and cleanse our Streets, nay, those, who fight our battels\r\nin the defence of their Country, are the _Poor Souldiers_, who, as\r\nthe Legions of _Blæsus_ once complained in a Mutiny, sell their\r\nlives for seven pence a day. As there must be Rich to be, like the\r\nCenturian in the Gospel, in Authority: so there must be Poor, to whom\r\nthey may say, _Go unto one, and he goeth, and to another come, and he\r\ncometh_; but were all equally rich, there could be no subordination,\r\nnone to command, nor none to serve. But in such case, the Body\r\nPolitick must dissolve, as the Natural body was like to do in the\r\nFable of _Agrippa_, when the rest of the Members would work no longer\r\nfor the Belly, which, they thought did nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n[187] In 1656 there appeared a book by Elizabeth Major entitled\r\n_Honey on the Rod, or a Comfortable Contemplation for one in\r\nAffliction, with Sundry Poems. By the Unworthiest of the Servants of\r\nthe Lord Jesus Christ._ In 1652 had appeared anonymously _Eliza's\r\nBabes, or the Virgin's Offerings_. A detailed examination of the two\r\nbooks leads to a surmise that they are by the same author. What is\r\nprobably a unique copy of _Eliza's Babes_ is in the British Museum.\r\n(_Notes and Queries_, 7th Series, vol. III, p. 502.)\r\n\r\n[188] Cibber: _Lives of the Poets_, vol.

Being a Sermon Preach'd at a Wedding,\r\nMay the Eleventh, 1699 at Sherbourne in Dorsetshire._ It was from\r\n1 Cor. VII, 34, \"But she that is Married careth for the things of\r\nthe World, how she may please her Husband.\" He explains that \"Man\r\nwas all Affibility and Sweetness of Temper\" before the Fall, the\r\nchief responsibility for which was properly placed on Eve and her\r\nfemale descendants. God had also fully indicated her function when\r\nhe deliberately created her for the Profit and Comfort of Man. \"A\r\ngood wife,\" continues Mr. Sprint, \"should be like a Mirrour which\r\nhath no Image of its own, but receives its Stamp and Image from the\r\nFace that looks into it: So should a good Wife endeavour to frame\r\nher outward Deportment, and her inward Affections according to her\r\nHusband's.\" She must not only obey his commands but she must bring\r\n\"under unto him the very Desires of the Heart to be regulated by\r\nhim so far, that it should not be lawful for her to will or desire\r\nwhat she herself liked, but only what her husband should approve and\r\nallow.\" Mr. Sprint printed his sermon only because of attacks by some\r\n\"ill-natur'd Females.\" He gets his revenge by saying that he has not\r\nmet among all his accusers one woman \"whose Husband is able to give\r\nher the Character of a dutiful and obedient Wife.\"\r\n\r\n[209] Lady Chudleigh's summary of the arts of a successful wife is\r\nexemplified in a serious book published anonymously entitled _The\r\nFair Counsellor, or, The Young Lady's Conduct after Marriage_.\r\nCharlotte is instructing Olivia in \"The Art of Management.\" A woman\r\nmust recognize that she is confined to her husband for life and\r\nhence she should make it her business to please. She should learn to\r\nreflect his moods as in a glass. To all wayward humors she should\r\noppose passive obedience and non-resistance. If he should come home\r\nintoxicated she should \"by all the little innocent Arts of Love and\r\nfond Endearments decoy him to his Bed.\" An illustrative example of\r\nwhat may be done by gentleness and submission is the experience of\r\nSir Toby Testy and his wife. Sir Toby became so warm with anger\r\none day as to cane my Lady. She retired in tears to her own room,\r\nexplaining to him later that it seemed better to her to bemoan her\r\nfate in silence than to expose his unkindness to a censorious world.\r\nThe outcome was that he clasped her in his arms with a thousand\r\nendearing protestations, and never disobliged her again to his dying\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[210] Winchilsea, Lady: _Poems_ (ed. Reynolds, Myra); \"A Fragment.\"\r\n\r\n[211] That Lady Winchilsea's work was pretty well known before 1713\r\nis evident from an interesting passage in Mrs. Manley's _The New\r\nAtalantis_ (1709). Some invisible spectators are being taken about\r\nunder the guidance of \"Intelligence.\" They are observing the daily\r\nparade of coaches on the \"Prado\" when Intelligence calls attention to\r\na lady in one of the coaches. \"The Lady,\" he says, \"once belonged to\r\nthe Court, but marrying into the Country, she made it her Business\r\nto devote herself to the Muses, and has writ a great many pretty\r\nThings: These Verses of the Progress of Life, have met with abundance\r\nof applause, and therefore I recommend them to your Excellency's\r\nPerusal.\" _The Progress of Life_ is then quoted entire and Astræa\r\ncomments: \"The Lady speaks very feelingly: We need look no further\r\nthan this, to know that she's herself past that agreeable Age she so\r\nmuch regrets. However, I am very well pleas'd with the Thought that\r\nruns thro'; if she had contracted something of the second and third\r\nstanza, it had not been the Worse. I presume she's one of the Few\r\nthat write out of Pleasure, and not Necessity. By that means its her\r\nown Fault, if she publish any Thing but what's Good; for it's next to\r\nimpossible to write much and write well.\" (Vol. I, p. 186.) In the\r\n_Key_ the \"Lady\" thus spoken of is said to be \"Col. Finch's Lady once\r\na Maid of Honour.\" Mrs. Manley's version of _The Progress of Life_\r\nshows several slight verbal variations from the form published in\r\n1713. Two lines on Parnassus in the second stanza appeared in 1713 as\r\nmore orthodox lines on Canaan. But when Miss Seward's mother taught\r\nher the poem in 1763, it was the old and not the 1713 version that\r\nshe used. (Winchilsea, Lady: _Works_, ed.

IV, p. 139, is this\r\nstatement: \"From another of Miss Elstob's letters in the same\r\ncollection [letters to Mr. Ballard] it appears that Dr. Hickes was\r\nher grandfather by the mother's side; a circumstance which may\r\naccount for her proficiency, if not for the origin of her Saxon\r\nstudies.\" I have not as yet found confirmation of this relationship.\r\nIn the letters and dedications to him the brother and sister put\r\nforward no claim to relationship, and in the letter Dr. Hickes wrote\r\nin behalf of William Elstob and in those written in approbation of\r\nMiss Elstob's work, there is no indication that he was asking help\r\nfor his grandchildren. The _Dictionary of National Biography_ says\r\nthat Dr. Hickes \"left no children,\" a statement slightly ambiguous,\r\nfor while it conveys the impression that he had no children, it\r\nmight be literally true even if Jane Elstob were his daughter, for\r\nshe died about twenty-four years before he did. Nichols in _Literary\r\nAnecdotes_ speaks of an Elstob pedigree \"accompanied by another\r\npedigree of Mrs. Elstob's mother.\" These were on a single leaf\r\nfastened into Richard St. George's _Visitation of the County of\r\nDurham_ (1615), among the MSS. of the Harleian Collection.\r\n\r\n[238] Walker, John: _Letters of Eminent Persons_, vol.

But if any one wishes\r\nto see her as she was when she was the favorite of Dr. _Hudson_ and\r\nthe _Oxonians_, they may view her portraiture in the initial G of\r\n_The English Saxon homily on the birthday of St. Gregory_.\" This\r\nportrait is repeated in his _Grammar_.\r\n\r\n[242] In the \"G\" of Gregorium is a portrait of Mr. Thwaites as St.\r\nGregory. (Nichols: _Literary Anecdotes_, vol. IV, p. 131.)\r\n\r\n[243] _Letters of Eminent Men addressed to Ralph Thoresby, F. R. S._\r\n\r\n[244] A new edition of this _Homily_ was brought out by William\r\nPickering, Leicester, 1839.\r\n\r\n[245] _Homily on the Birthday of St. Gregory_, p. ii.\r\n\r\n[246] This _Grammar_ is \"remarkable for being the first effort\r\nto present the study of Old English through the medium of modern\r\nEnglish.\" (Adams, Eleanor N.: _Old English Scholarship in England\r\nfrom 1566-1800_, p. 92.)\r\n\r\n[247] July 31, 1715, Mr. Hearne wrote to Mr. Hickes thanking him\r\nfor his \"excellently learned _Thesaurus_,\" and for Mrs. Elstob's\r\n_Grammar_. He comments on her Preface as \"judicious, learned, and\r\nelegant.\" He is particularly pleased with her remarks on the author\r\nof the \"Dissertation on reading the Classicks, and forming a just\r\nstile.\" This gentleman was of St. Edmund's Hall and was always looked\r\nupon as a vain, flashy person. \"I look'd upon him as the most unfit\r\nPerson I knew of a Scholar to write upon this Subject.... His book\r\nhath been sufficiently ridiculed & condemned her by y^e best Judges.\"\r\n(_Hearne's Collections_, vol. IV, p. 83.)\r\n\r\n[248] An interesting fact in connection with the publication of the\r\n_Grammar_ has to do with the type. Some years after the printing of\r\nthe _Homily_ the house of the printer, Mr. Bowyer, was burned and\r\nall the Anglo-Saxon type was destroyed. They could not have printed\r\nthe _Grammar_ had not Lord Chief Justice Parker provided the funds\r\nfor cutting new type. In 1753 Mr. N. Bowyer, son of the printer of\r\nthe _Grammar_, sent this type, as a curiosity, to Mr. Edward Rowe\r\nMores with this letter: \"I make bold to transmit to Oxford, through\r\nyour hands, the Saxon punches and matrices, which you were pleased\r\nto intimate would not be unacceptable to that learned Body. It would\r\nbe a great satisfaction to me if I could by this means perpetuate\r\nthe munificence of the noble Donor, to whom I am originally indebted\r\nfor them, the late Lord Chief Justice Parker, afterwards Earl of\r\nMacclesfield, who, among the numerous Benefactors which my father\r\nmet with, after his house was burnt in 1712-13, was so good as to\r\nprocure those types to be cut, to enable him to print Mrs. Elstob's\r\nSaxon Grammar. England had not then the advantage of such an Artist\r\nin Lettercutting as has since arisen: and that as my father received\r\nthem from a great Patron of Learning, his son consigns them to the\r\ngreatest Seminary of it.\" (Nichols: _Literary Anecdotes_, vol. II,\r\npp. 355-59.) In 1768 Mr. Edward Rowe Mores presented these punches\r\nand matrices to the Society of Antiquaries, and the Reverend Mr.\r\nPegge at that time communicated to the Society some account of\r\nWilliam and Elizabeth Elstob. (_Archæologia_, 1804, vol. I, p.\r\nxxv.) The difficulty in getting good type is shown by the following\r\nletters: May 19, 1713, Mr. Robert Nelson wrote to Mr. Wanley: \"Pray\r\ndo me the favor to write out the Saxon characters for Mr. Bowyer,\r\nas you have kindly promised; despatch in this affair is of great\r\nconsequence because my Lord Chief Justice Parker does intend to\r\nassist towards repairing this misfortune by giving him a set of\r\npress letters, and is very uneasy that he is not ready to begin\r\nhis friend's book which requires these characters to perfect it.\"\r\n(_Anecdotes of Bowyer_, p. 493.) Mr. Wanley said that he wrote out\r\nthe letters in the most exact and able manner that he could \"But it\r\nsignified little; for when the alphabet came into the hands of the\r\nworkman (who was but a blunderer) he could not imitate the fine and\r\nregular stroke of the pen; so that the letters are not only clumsy,\r\nbut unlike those that I drew. This appears by _Mrs. Elstob's Saxon\r\nGrammar_ being the book mentioned by Mr. Nelson.\" (_Ibid._, p. 498.)\r\n\r\n[249] Nichols: _Illustrations of Literary History_, vol.

IV, p. 132.)\r\n\r\n[254] _Hearne's Collections_, vol. IV, p. 87.\r\n\r\n[255] _Ibid._, vol.

Mr. Rowe Mores said\r\nthat Miss Elstob had once had a genteel fortune, but that she had\r\n\"pursued too much the drug called learning, and in that pursuit\r\nfailed of being careful of any one thing necessary.\"\r\n\r\n[263] \"The learned Saxonist, Mrs. Elstob, was one, among many others,\r\nwho about this period [1714] experienced the new Bishop's bounty.\"\r\n(Nichols: _Illustrations of Literary History_, vol. III, p. 227.) Mr.\r\nThomas Seward, Bishop of Lichfield, knew Miss Elstob and was one of\r\nthe contributors to her support.

Gordon wrote, \"We are every day increasing both\r\nin number and in members either conspicuous for their quality or\r\nstation, or learning and ingenuity.\" But constant difficulties\r\narose between the Society and book-sellers. No plan tried proved\r\nsatisfactory to both parties. By 1765 the finances of the Society\r\nwere practically exhausted, and in April, 1746, the Society came to\r\nan abrupt close, after a starving and not very productive ten years.\r\n(Nichols: _Anecdotes of Bowyer_, pp. 134-38.)\r\n\r\n[281] Miss Emily M. Symonds says of the author of the _Anecdotes_:\r\n\"Lady Louisa Stuart inherited her grandmother's tastes for literary\r\npursuits. That this taste was discouraged by her family is a real\r\ncalamity, as all will agree who are familiar with the _Selections\r\nfrom her Manuscripts (Essays and Verses)_, and the _Letters to Miss\r\nClinton_. Her sketch of the family of John, Duke of Argyll, is a\r\nbiographical gem, and her youthful letters read as if they had been\r\nwritten by one of Jane Austen's most charming heroines. Her satire\r\nis so sweet-tempered that it is evident she likes her victims none\r\nthe less for her laughter, while her common-sense philosophy, with\r\nits sub-acid flavour of gentle cynicism may be studied with advantage\r\neven in these enlightened days. A glimpse of Lady Mary's daughter and\r\ngranddaughter may be obtained from the _Diary_ of Miss Burney, who\r\nmet the two ladies at Mrs. Delany's in 1787. Lady Bute, she records,\r\nwith an exterior the most forbidding to strangers, has powers of\r\nconversation the most entertaining and lively where she is intimate.\r\nShe is full of anecdote, delights in strokes of general satire, yet\r\nwith mere love of comic, not insidious ridicule. She spares not for\r\ngiving her opinions, and laughs at fools as well as follies, with the\r\nshrewdest derision. Lady Louisa Stuart, her youngest daughter, has\r\nparts equal to those of her mother, with a deportment and appearance\r\ninfinitely more pleasing; yet she is far from handsome, but proves\r\nhow well beauty may be occasionally missed, when understanding and\r\nvivacity unite to fill up her place.... They seem both to inherit\r\nan ample portion of the wit of their mother and grandmother, Lady\r\nMary Wortley Montagu, though I believe them both to have escaped\r\nall inheritance of her faults. On the occasion of another and later\r\nmeeting Miss Burney writes: 'Lady Bute and Lady Louisa were both in\r\nsuch high spirits themselves, that they kept up all the conversation\r\nbetween them with such a vivacity, an acuteness, and an observation\r\non men and manners so clear and so sagacious, that it would be\r\ndifficult to pass an evening of greater entertainment.'\" (Symonds,\r\nEmily Morse: _Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Her Times_, p. 537.)\r\n\r\n[282] Symonds, Emily Morse: _Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Her\r\nTimes_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[283] _The Letters and Works of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu_ (Bell,\r\n1887), vol. II, p. 240.\r\n\r\n[284] _Ibid._, LXXVI. Lady Louisa gives the later history of these\r\nponderous black books saying that they survived the wear and tear\r\nof a century through the protection of an excellent person who had\r\nbeen Lady Bute's attendant before her marriage, and a part of the\r\nfamily ever after. \"Her spectacles were always to be found in Clelia\r\nand Cassandra, which she studied unceasingly six days of the week,\r\nprizing them next to the Bible and Tillotson's Sermons; because, to\r\ngive her own words, they were all about good and virtuous people,\r\nnot like the wicked trash she now saw young people get from the\r\ncirculating libraries.\"\r\n\r\n[285] Symonds: _Lady Mary Wortley Montagu and Her Times_, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[286] _Spence's Anecdotes_, by Singer (Ed. 1820), p. 232.\r\n\r\n[287] Montagu, Lady Mary: _Works_, vol.

The debate referred to\r\nwas on the conduct of the Spanish government, and took place on\r\nThursday, March 1, 1739. Mrs. Pendarves, afterwards Mrs. Delany,\r\ngives the following slightly different account of the matter: \"Lady\r\nWestmoreland ... and the Duchess of Queensberry, Mrs. Fortescue\r\nand myself, set forward for Westminster, and got up to the gallery\r\ndoor without any difficulty. There were thirteen ladies more that\r\ncame with the same intention. To tell you all the particulars of\r\nour provocations, the insults of the doorkeepers and our unshaken\r\nintrepidity, would flourish out more paper than a single frank\r\nwould contain; but we bore the buffets of a stinking crowd from\r\nhalf an hour after ten till five in the afternoon without moving an\r\ninch from our places, only see-sawing about as the motion of the\r\nmultitude forced us. At last, our committee resolved to adjourn to\r\nthe coffeehouse of the Court of Request, where debates began how we\r\nwere to proceed? It was agreed amongst us to address Sir Charles\r\nDalton (gentleman usher of the Black Rod) for admittance. The address\r\nwas presented, and an answer returned that whilst one lady remained\r\nin the passage to the gallery, the door should not be opened for\r\nthe members of the House of Commons, so we generously gave them the\r\nliberty of taking their places. As soon as the door was opened, they\r\nall rushed in, and we followed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to compare the events of this attack on the House\r\nof Lords with two similar attempts to affect legislative action\r\nin the seventeenth century. In 1643, when some peace propositions\r\nhad been under consideration in the House of Commons, but had been\r\nfinally abandoned, the women of London, with white silk ribbons\r\nin their hats, went in great numbers to the House bearing a peace\r\npetition. The House sent out a deputation of three or four members to\r\nmeet them, mollify them, and induce them to return home. Rushworth\r\nrecounts the further progress of the affair:\r\n\r\n\"But the women, not satisfied, remain'd thereabouts, and by noon\r\nwere encreased to five thousand at the least; and some men of the\r\nrabble in women's cloaths mixt themselves amongst them and instigated\r\nthem to go to the Commons door and cry 'Peace, Peace,' which they\r\ndid accordingly, thrusting to the door of the House at the upper\r\nstairs head; and as soon as they were pass'd a part of the Trained\r\nBand (that usually stood sentinal there) thrust the soldiers down\r\nand would suffer none to come in or go out of the House for near two\r\nhours. The Trained Band advised them to come down, and first pulled\r\nthem; and, afterwards to fright them shot powder. But they cry'd\r\nout 'Nothing but powder,' and having brickbats in the yard threw\r\nthem apace at the Trained Band, who then shot bullets, and killed\r\na ballad-singer with one arm that was heartening on the women, and\r\nanother poor man that came accidentally. Yet the women not daunted,\r\ncry'd out the louder at the door of the House of Commons, 'Give\r\nus these traitors that are against peace that we may tear them to\r\npieces, give us that dog Pym.'\"\r\n\r\nThis \"Female Riot\" had a disastrous end. When Waller's troopers\r\nwent by with his colors in their hats, the women snatched some of\r\nthe ribbons, calling the men Waller's dogs. The troopers defended\r\nthemselves, at first with swords \"flatways,\" but later cutting so\r\nfuriously over hands and faces that most of the women fled. The few\r\nwho remained were later dispersed by a troop of horses.\r\n\r\n[293] On her return she brought nineteen volumes of this journal\r\nwhich she entrusted to her daughter. Lady Bute kept them under lock\r\nand key, occasionally reading passages from them, and once allowing\r\nher daughter, Lady Louisa, to read the first portions. Before Lady\r\nBute's death the manuscript was solemnly burned as a sacred duty to\r\nher mother's memory.\r\n\r\n[294] Montagu, Lady Mary: _Works_, vol.

Of the four chief women, Laura Bassi, Anna Manzolini,\r\nMaria Agnesi, Clotilda Tambroni, the first three had attained to\r\nfame before 1755 when Miss Masters's book appeared. Maria Agnesi\r\n(1718-1808) was a European celebrity by the time she was twenty.\r\n\"M. Charles de Brosses, in his _Lettres Familières écrites de\r\nl'Italie en 1739 et 1740_, speaks of Agnesi in terms that recall\r\nthe marvellous stories which are related of Admirable Crichton and\r\nCico della Mirandola. 'She appeared to me,' he tells us, 'something\r\nmore stupendous--_una cosa piu stupenda_--than the Duomo of Milan.'\r\nHaving been invited to a _conversazione_ for the purpose of meeting\r\nthis wonderful woman, the learned Frenchman found her to be 'a young\r\nlady about eighteen or twenty.' She was surrounded by 'about thirty\r\npeople--many of them from different parts of Europe.' The discussion\r\nturned on various questions of mathematics and natural philosophy.\"\r\nThe astonishment excited by her knowledge of these abstruse subjects\r\nwas increased by her command of classical Latin which she spoke with\r\npurity, care, and accuracy. When the conversation became general she\r\nspoke to each person in the language of his own country. At about\r\nthirty Maria Agnesi brought out her great work, a treatise in two\r\nlarge volumes on the differential and integral calculus. \"It would\r\nbe impossible to describe the sensation it produced in the learned\r\nworld. Everybody talked about it; everybody admired the profound\r\nlearning of the author, and acclaimed her: 'Il portento del sesso,\r\nunico al Mondo'--the portent of her sex, unique in the world.\"\r\n(Mozans: _Woman in Science_, pp. 143-53.)\r\n\r\nLaura Caterina Bassi (1711-78) would take rank with learned women\r\nof any age or nation. At twenty-one she took part in a public\r\ndisputation on philosophy with some of the most distinguished\r\nscholars of the time as her opponents. The brilliancy of her success\r\non this occasion led to a request that she should present herself\r\nas candidate for the doctorate in philosophy. This was a still\r\nmore imposing ceremony. It was held in the Communal Palace which\r\nwas magnificently decorated for the splendid function. After a\r\ndiscourse in Latin to which she responded in the same tongue, she\r\nwas crowned with a laurel wreath exquisitely wrought in silver, and\r\nhad thrown round her the _vajo_, or university gown, both symbols\r\nof the doctorate. Her next triumph was when she passed the public\r\nexaminations and was appointed by acclamation to the chair of physics\r\nin the University of Bologna, an office which she held many years,\r\nand always with increasing fame. (Mozans: _Woman in Science_, pp.\r\n202-09.)\r\n\r\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu was much impressed by the fame of Laura\r\nBassi and wrote to England about her, and Lady Pomfret, on her visit\r\nto Italy, made a point of seeing the famous lady professor; but in\r\ngeneral the Englishwomen seem to have been quite ignorant of the\r\nstatus of learned women in Italy.\r\n\r\nAnna Manzolini (1716-1774) held the chair of anatomy in Bologna for\r\nmany years and is famous for her wax models of the organs of the\r\nhuman body.

This new art of expressing representations of objects upon\r\nwhite paper became the object of universal curiosity, and the artist\r\nwas encouraged by all the courts of _Europe_. The Elector _Palatine_\r\noffered her a thousand florins (equal to about a hundred guineas) for\r\nthree little pieces, which she refused.... The works of this woman\r\nare in design and taste extremely correct, and may best be compared\r\nwith the engravings of Mallon. When they are pasted upon black paper,\r\nthe places where the white paper is cut away in strokes, represent\r\nthose of a graver or pen, and are in the highest degree neat, true,\r\nbold, and distinct.\" (_The Gentleman's Magazine_, 1761, p. 338). The\r\ncut-work paper in England never equalled that of Mrs. Block until\r\nMrs. Delany's herbarium in the late eighteenth century out-distanced\r\nall competitors.

No woman ever\r\nwas or will be a _polyhistor_, like Salmasius, for example; nor a\r\nphilosopher; nor, in fact anything whatsoever, called by what name\r\nyou like, which demands either of these two combinations which\r\nfollow:--1, great powers of combination, that is, of massing or\r\ngrouping under large comprehensive principles; or, 2, severe logic.\"\r\n(_Works_, ed.

I don't think the Maid of Honour a proper person to\r\napply to; if he would only leave out his dedication to me _I could_\r\nsolicit for him, but _as it is_, it has even stopped my applying to\r\nget subscriptions.\" (_Mrs. Delany's Letters._ First Series, vol. III,\r\np. 186.) In December she wrote: \"I am afraid Mr. Ballard has not a\r\nlarge subscription; it vexes me that he should prevent my being of\r\nuse to him, but if we are successful in our affairs I shall hope to\r\n_make it up to him_.\" (_Ibid._)\r\n\r\n[473] The ladies whose poems are included in these volumes are: Mrs.\r\nBarber, Mrs. Behn, Miss Carter, Lady Chudleigh, Mrs. Cockburn, Mrs.\r\nGrierson, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Killigrew, Mrs. Leapor, Mrs. Madan, Mrs.\r\nMasters, Lady M. W. Montagu, Mrs. Monk, Duchess of Newcastle, Mrs. K.\r\nPhilips, Mrs. Pilkington, Mrs. Rowe, Lady Winchilsea.\r\n\r\n[474] _Memoirs: Containing the Lives of Several Ladies of Great\r\nBritain. A History of Antiquities, Productions of Nature and\r\nMonuments of Art. Observations on the Christian Religion, as\r\nprofessed by the Established Church, and Dissenters of every\r\nDenomination. Remarks on the Writings of the greatest English\r\nDivines: with a Variety of Disquisitions and Opinions relative to\r\nCriticisms and Manners; and many extraordinary Actions._\r\n\r\n[475] The _Memoirs_ (vol. II, p. 87) say that Miss Harcourt \"died\r\nsuddenly, at her seat in Richmondshire, the first of December 1745,\r\nin the 39th year of her age, and not in the year thirty-seven, as\r\nthe world was told in several advertisements in the London Evening\r\nPost of December 1739, by a gentleman who was imposed on in a false\r\naccount he received of her death.\" I have been unable to examine the\r\n_London Evening Post_ to see whether it contains any announcement\r\ncorrespondent to Amory's statement. (Rose says she was born in 1706\r\nat Richmond in Yorkshire and that she died in 1745.)\r\n\r\n[476] For Amory's exceptionally early and eager descriptions of the\r\nEnglish Lake District see Reynolds, Myra: _External Nature in English\r\nPoetry between Pope and Wordsworth_ (2d ed.), p. 208. To this must\r\nnow be added his distinction as one of the earliest Englishmen to be\r\ninterested in the islands off the coast of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[477] For further accounts of Thomas Amory see _The Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_, November, 1788 (vol. LVIII, p. 1062), where there is a\r\nprotest from Robert Amory concerning erroneous statements about\r\nhis father in the _St. James's Chronicle_ of November 6 (cf. vol.\r\nLIX, pp. 107, 322, 372); _General Biographical Dictionary_ (1798);\r\nChalmers' _Biographical Dictionary_; Hazlitt's _Round Table_ (1817);\r\n_Retrospective Review_ (vol. VI, p. 100, 1st Series, 1822); edition\r\nof Amory's _Works_ (1825); _Notes and Queries_, 1st Series, vol. XI,\r\np. 58; _Saturday Review_, May 12, 1877. From these references it\r\nbecomes apparent that Amory has attracted considerable attention,\r\nbut that there is a wide divergence of opinion as to whether he was\r\ninsane or a genius.\r\n\r\n[478] _Epicœne, or, The Silent Woman_, Act II, Sc. 2, ll. 117-20.\r\n\r\n[479] Juvenal: Satire VI, 434-40. \"That woman is a worse nuisance\r\nthan usual who, as soon as she reclines on her couch, praises Virgil;\r\nmakes excuses for doomed Dido; pits bards against one another and\r\ncompares them, and weighs Homer and Mars in the balance.\"\r\n\r\n[480] The word \"college\" was loosely used in the seventeenth century\r\nas signifying any company or collective body. Burton, in _Anatomy\r\nof Melancholy_ (1621), says, \"They have whole colleges of Curtezans\r\nin their Towns and Cities.\" Randolph, in _The Muse's Looking-Glass_\r\n(1638), calls play-houses \"colleges of transgression,\" and speaks\r\nof \"Black-Friar's College.\" Jonson, in _Staple of News_, says \"a\r\ncanter's college is proposed.\" Dryden even speaks of a \"college of\r\nbees\" (_Flower and Leaf_), and Amory, in _John Buncle_, uses the same\r\nphrase more than half a century later. It becomes evident, then,\r\nthat the words \"college\" and \"collegiate\" might be used without any\r\nthought of an organization founded for purposes of learning. (See\r\nJonson: _Epicœne_, Ed. Henry, Aurelia, p. 138.)\r\n\r\n[481] Miles, Dudley: _The Influence of Molière on Restoration\r\nComedy_, chap. III.\r\n\r\n[482] _Ibid._, p. 62.\r\n\r\n[483] _Ibid._, p. 68.\r\n\r\n[484] There are two other indications of the early influence of _Les\r\nPrécieuses_. Flecknoe published in 1667 an unacted play entitled\r\n_Damoiselles à la mode_, a sort of mosaic made up from four plays\r\nof which _Les Précieuses_ was one. September 15, 1668, Pepys wrote:\r\n\"To the King's play-house, to see a new play, acted but yesterday, a\r\ntranslation out of French by Dryden, called 'The Lady's à la Mode':\r\nso mean a thing as when they came to say it would be acted again\r\nto-morrow, both he that said it, Beeson, and the pit fell a-laughing,\r\nthere being this day not a quarter of the pit full.\" Pepys is the\r\nonly authority for attributing the piece to Dryden.\r\n\r\n[485] It is interesting to note that the dedication is to Charles,\r\nEarl of Winchilsea, whose aunt, Mrs. Finch, one of the _literati_,\r\nwas at that time living with the young Earl, at Eastwell, and had\r\neven then a vast folio of verse and prose with which the family\r\ncircle was occasionally regaled. She would hardly enjoy this choice\r\nof her nephew as public patron of Wright's caricature of female wits.\r\n\r\n[486] See p. 106.\r\n\r\n[487] See p. 208.\r\n\r\n[488] See p. 132.\r\n\r\n[489] See Winchilsea, Lady: _Works_ (edited by Myra Reynolds),\r\nIntroduction, pp. lxii-lxx, for full account of this character.\r\n\r\n[490] This scene may refer both to Lady Winchilsea and the Duchess\r\nof Newcastle. Cibber, in his _Lives of the Poets_, vol. II, p. 164,\r\nsays: \"The Duchess kept a great many young ladies about her person,\r\nwho occasionally wrote what she dictated. Some of them slept in a\r\nroom contiguous to that in which her Grace lay, and ever ready, at\r\nthe call of her bell to rise any hour of the night, to write down her\r\nconceptions, lest they should escape her memory.\"\r\n\r\n[491] Curll: _No Fool like Wits_, Prologue.\r\n\r\n[492] Seigneur de Gomberville brought out his _Polexandre_ in four\r\nvolumes, quarto, in 1632. More famous were La Calprenède's romances,\r\n_Cléopâtre_, _Cassandre_, and _Pharamond_, and the works of the\r\nScudéry brother and sister (the sister being the chief writer) who\r\nwrote _Ibrahim_, _Artemène_, _Clélie_, and _Almahide_. All of these\r\nexcept _Polexandre_ were published and some of them republished\r\nin France between 1641 and 1661. Their interminable length may be\r\nillustrated by _Artemène_ which was in ten volumes, a total of 6679\r\npages.\r\n\r\n[493] _Letters from Dorothy Osborne to Sir William Temple_, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[494] Pepys: _Diary_, Dec. 7, 1660; Feb. 10, 1661; May 12, 1666; Nov.\r\n16, 1668; May 5, 1669.\r\n\r\n[495] _The Ladies' Calling_, part II, section II.\r\n\r\n[496] Shadwell, Thomas: _Bury-Fair_, Act III, Sc. 1.\r\n\r\n[497] Steele, Richard: _The Tender Husband; or, The Accomplished\r\nFools_ (1705).\r\n\r\n[498] Urganda was an enchantress in the Amadis and Palmerin romances.\r\n\r\n[499] Musidorus, in Sir P. Sidney's _Arcadia_, is the Prince of\r\nThessaly, and in love with Pamela.\r\n\r\n[500] Parthenissa was the heroine of a romance of that name by Roger\r\nBoyle, Earl of Orrery, the first two parts of which appeared in 1651.\r\n\r\n[501] Statira, in _Cassandra_, was the widow of Alexander the Great,\r\nand the daughter of Darius. She married Oroondates after many\r\ndifficulties had been overcome.\r\n\r\n[502] Chambers, in _Traditions of Edinburgh_ (1869), says that Allan\r\nRamsay in 1725 set up \"a circulating library, whence he diffused\r\nplays and other books of fiction among the people of Edinburgh. It\r\nappears from some private notes of the historian Wodrow that, in\r\n1728, the magistrates, moved by some meddling spirits, took alarm at\r\nthe effect of this kind of reading on the minds of youth, and made an\r\nattempt to put it down, but without effect.\"\r\n\r\nThe editor of _Notes and Queries_ (4th Series, vol. IX, p. 443) says,\r\n\"We are inclined to think the first circulating library in Scotland\r\nwas in Dunfermline in 1711.\"\r\n\r\nScotland was ahead of England in the matter of circulating libraries.\r\nSo far as I can discover, Newcastle-on-Tyne has the honor of starting\r\nthe first circulating library in England. One Joseph Barber had \"lent\r\nbooks on the High Bridge, at the other end of the Flesh Market,\r\nin 1746, and now, in 1757, at Amen Corner, near St. Nicholas's\r\nChurchyard, he had 1257 volumes on loan. His was the 'old original'\r\nlibrary of circulation.\" In 1757 a rival appeared in the person of\r\nWilliam Charnley who placed two thousand volumes at the command of\r\nsubscribers at twelve shillings a year. (_Notes and Queries_, 5th\r\nSeries, vol. VIII, p. 155.)\r\n\r\nIn 1751 a circulating library was opened in Birmingham by the famous\r\nWilliam Hutton, who wrote in his _Autobiography_, \"I was the first\r\nwho opened a circulating library in Birmingham, in 1751, since\r\nwhich time many have entered the race.\" He also said, \"As I hired\r\nout books the fair sex did not neglect my shop.\" In 1750 there had\r\nbeen opened at Birmingham a book-club for the circulation of books\r\namong its members--\"probably the oldest book-club in existence,\" and\r\nstill flourishing in 1877. The Manchester subscription library dates\r\nfrom 1765, or earlier. (_Ibid._, 5th Series, vol. VII, p. 452.) The\r\ncirculating library of Liverpool was established May 1, 1758. The\r\nfirst catalogue is dated November 1, 1758. There were 109 subscribers\r\nat five shillings each, and 450 volumes. The centenary of this\r\nlibrary was celebrated May 13, 1858. (_Ibid._ 5th Series, vol. VII,\r\np. 354.) In January, 1761, Mr. Baker, book-seller of Tunbridge Wells,\r\nlost his circulating library by fire. By 1770 there were circulating\r\nlibraries at Settle, Rochdale, Exeter, and doubtless other places.\r\nIn _The Annual Register_ (p. 207) for 1761 is an interesting note:\r\n\"The reading female hires her novels from some country circulating\r\nlibrary, which consists of about an hundred volumes,\" which might\r\nvery well apply to Polly Honeycomb. (_Ibid._ 7th Series, vol. XII, p.\r\n66.)\r\n\r\nWhen Franklin came to London in 1725 there was not a single\r\ncirculating library in the metropolis. See Franklin's _Autobiography_\r\n(vol. I, p. 64), and in 1697 the only library in London which\r\napproached the nature of a public library was that of Zion College,\r\nbelonging to the London clergy (Ellis's _Letters of Literary Men_,\r\np. 245). The exact date of the earliest London circulating library I\r\nhave not yet ascertained; but according to Southey (_The Doctor_, ed.\r\nWarter, 1848, p. 271) the first set up in London was about the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century by Samuel Fancourt. (Buckle: _History\r\nof Civilization in England_, vol. I, p. 393.) Samuel Fancourt was\r\na dissenting minister who went to London about 1730. A library\r\nconducted by him at a subscription of a guinea a year was dissolved,\r\nMichaelmas, 1745. Between 1746 and 1748 he issued an alphabetical\r\ncatalogue of _Books and Pamphlets belonging to the Circulating\r\nLibrary in Crane Court_, in two volumes. In this \"Gentlemen and\r\nLadies' Growing and Circulating Library\" the initial payment was a\r\nguinea and four shillings a year. A subscriber could draw one book\r\nand one pamphlet at a time. \"He may keep them a reasonable time\r\naccording to their bigness.\" This library contained between two and\r\nthree thousand volumes, only about a tenth being light literature,\r\nand nearly half the total contents being on theology. (_Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography_, under Fancourt.)\r\n\r\n[503] _The Adventures of Jack Smart_ and _The History of Miss Betsey\r\nThoughtless_ are in Colman's list.\r\n\r\n[504] _The Reward of Constancy_ (possibly Shebeare's _The Happy Pair;\r\nor, Virtue and Constancy rewarded_, 1771); _The Fatal Connexion_,\r\nby Mrs. Fogarty (1773); _The Mistakes of the Heart_, by Treyssac de\r\nVergy (1769); _The Delicate Distress_ (1769) and _The Gordian Knot_\r\n(1769), by Mrs. Griffith; _The Memoirs of Lady Woodford_ (1771);\r\n_Peregrine Pickle_, by Smollett (1751); _Tears of Sensibility_,\r\ntranslated from French by John Murdock (1773); _Humphrey Clinker_, by\r\nSmollett (1771); _Sentimental Journey_, by Sterne (1768); _Roderick\r\nRandom_, by Smollett (1748; eighth ed. 1770); _The Innocent Adultery_\r\n(translation of Scarron's _L'Adultère Innocente_, in 1722-29 and with\r\nlater editions); _Lord Aimsworth_ (1773); _The Man of Feeling_, by\r\nMackenzie (1771). For full comment on these books, and the others in\r\nLydia's list see _Major Dramas of Richard Brinsley Sheridan_ (edited\r\nby George Henry Nettleton), Introduction, pp. lxviii-lxxvii.\r\n\r\n[505] Page 354.\r\n\r\n[506] The new names are Mrs. Behn, Mrs. Manley, Mrs. Centlivre, Mrs.\r\nThomas, Mrs. Rowe, Mrs. Cockburn, Mrs. Pilkington, and Miss Chandler.\r\nBallard (p. vii) gives a list of the ladies who had a reputation for\r\nlearning, but concerning whom he could get no information. The list\r\nis as follows: \"Lady Mary Nevil, Lady Anne Southwell, Lady Honor\r\nHay, Lady Mary Wroath, Lady Armyn, Lady Ranelagh, Lady Anne Boynton\r\n(famous for her skill in ancient coins, and noble collection of\r\nthem), Lady Levet, Lady Warner. Gentlewomen: Mrs. Mabilla Vaughan,\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Grimstone, Mrs. Jane Owen, Mrs. M. Croft, Mrs. Emilia\r\nLanyer, Mrs. Makins (who corresponded in the learned languages with\r\nMrs. Maria à Schurman), Mrs. Gertrude More, Mrs. Dorothy Leigh.\"\r\nNone of Cibber's additions appear in this list. Apparently Ballard's\r\nomission of writers of comedy and fiction would indicate that he did\r\nnot count them among the learned. The omission of Mrs. Cockburn is\r\nless explicable. The five _Lives_ given by both Ballard and Cibber\r\nare of the Duchess of Newcastle, Anne Killigrew, Lady Chudleigh, Mrs.\r\nMonk, Lady Winchilsea, and Mrs. Grierson.\r\n\r\n[507] Pages 4-23.\r\n\r\n[508] Pages 23-37.\r\n\r\n[509] Strickland, Agnes: _Lives of the Queens of England_, under\r\n\"Anne of Denmark.\"\r\n\r\n[510] Pages 46-81.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.\r\n\r\n  A superscript is denoted by ^; for example, w^{ch} or y^e.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within\r\n  the text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Repeated headings were removed to avoid redundancy for the reader.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspelling in the text,\r\n  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n  Pg 53.
