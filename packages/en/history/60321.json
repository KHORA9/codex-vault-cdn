I can only say that I have\r\nstriven to the utmost to prevent the entrance of any national bias into\r\nthe presentation of the picture.\r\n\r\nAs to the second influence. It is difficult to account for the fact that\r\nso interesting a page of our history should have remained unwritten.\r\nEven authors of fiction, who have pressed every department of history\r\ninto their service, have, with about half a dozen exceptions, neglected\r\nit as a source of inspiration, whilst historical accounts are limited to\r\nMr. Basil Thomson’s _Story of Dartmoor Prison_, Dr. T. J. Walker’s\r\n_Norman Cross_, and Mr. W. Sievwright’s _Perth Depôt_, all of which I\r\nhave been permitted to make use of, and local handbooks.\r\n\r\nYet the sojourn among us of thousands of war prisoners between the years\r\n1756 and 1815 must have been an important feature of our national\r\nlife—especially that of officers on parole in our country towns; despite\r\nwhich, during my quest in many counties of England, Scotland, and Wales,\r\nI have been surprised to find how rapidly and completely the memory of\r\nthis sojourn has faded; how faintly even it lingers in local tradition;\r\nhow much haziness there is, even in the minds of educated people, as to\r\nwho or what prisoners of war were; and how the process of gathering\r\ninformation has been one of almost literal excavation and disinterment.\r\nBut the task has been a great delight. It has introduced me to all sorts\r\nand conditions of interesting people; it has taken me to all sorts of\r\nodd nooks and corners of the country; and it has drawn my attention to a\r\nliterature which is not less valuable because it is merely local. I need\r\nnot say that but for the interest and enthusiasm of private individuals\r\nI could never have accomplished the task, and to them I hope I have made\r\nsufficient acknowledgement in the proper places, although it is possible\r\nthat, from their very multitude, I may have been guilty of omissions,\r\nfor which I can only apologize.\r\n\r\n                                                           FRANCIS ABELL\r\n\r\n LONDON, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER                                                            PAGE\r\n\r\n      I.

Did we of Britain treat our prisoners of war with the brutality\r\nalleged by foreign writers almost without exception?\r\n\r\n2. Did our Government sin in this respect more than did other\r\nGovernments in their treatment of the prisoners taken from us?\r\n\r\nAs an Englishman I much regret to say in reply to the first question,\r\nthat, after a very rigorous examination of authorities and weighing of\r\nevidence, and making allowance for the not unnatural exaggeration and\r\nembellishment by men smarting under deprivation of liberty, I find that\r\nforeigners have not unduly emphasized the brutality with which we\r\ntreated a large proportion of our prisoners of war, and I am fairly\r\nconfident that after a study of the following pages my readers will\r\nagree with me.\r\n\r\nBetween our treatment of prisoners on parole and in confinement on land,\r\nand foreign treatment of our countrymen similarly situated, the\r\ndifference, if any, is very slight, but nothing comparable with the\r\nEnglish prison-ship system existed anywhere else, except at Cadiz after\r\nthe battle of Baylen in 1808, and to the end of time this abominable,\r\nuseless, and indefensible system will remain a stain upon our national\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the second question, the balance appears to be fairly even\r\nbetween the behaviour of our own and foreign Governments—at any rate,\r\nbetween ours and that of France—for Britain and France practically\r\nmonopolize the consideration of our subject; the number of prisoners\r\ntaken by and from the United States, Spain, Holland, Denmark, and other\r\ncountries, is comparatively insignificant.\r\n\r\nEach Government accused the other. Each Government defended itself. Each\r\nGovernment could bring forward sufficient evidence to condemn the other.\r\nEach Government, judging by the numerous official documents which may be\r\nexamined, seems really to have aimed at treating its prisoners as\r\nhumanely and as liberally as circumstances would allow. Each Government\r\nwas badly served by just those sections of its subordinates which were\r\nin the closest and most constant contact with the prisoners. It is\r\nimpossible to read the printed and written regulations of the two\r\nGovernments with regard to the treatment of war-prisoners without being\r\nimpressed by their justness, fairness, and even kindness. The French\r\nrules published in 1792, for instance, are models of humane\r\nconsideration; they emphatically provided that foreign prisoners were to\r\nbe treated exactly as French soldiers in the matter of sustenance,\r\nlodging, and care when sick.\r\n\r\nAll this was nullified by the behaviour of subordinates. It is equally\r\nimpossible to read the personal narratives of British prisoners in\r\nFrance and of French prisoners in Britain without being convinced that\r\nthe good wills of the two Governments availed little against the\r\nbrutality, the avarice, and the dishonesty of the officials charged with\r\nthe carrying out of the benevolent instructions.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that Governments which really intended to act fairly\r\nwould have taken care that they were suitably served. So we think\r\nto-day. But it must always be borne in mind that the period covered in\r\nthis book—from 1756 to 1815—cannot be judged by the light of to-day. It\r\nwas an age of corruption from the top to the bottom of society, and it\r\nis not to be wondered at that, if Ministers and Members of Parliament,\r\nand officers of every kind—naval, military, and civil—were as\r\nessentially objects of sale and purchase as legs of mutton and suits of\r\nclothes, the lower orders of men in authority, those who were in most\r\ndirect touch with the prisoners of war, should not have been immune from\r\nthe contagion.\r\n\r\nMost exactly, too, must it be remembered by the commentator of to-day\r\nthat the age was not only corrupt, but hard and brutal; that beneath the\r\nveneer of formal politeness of manner there was an indifference to human\r\nsuffering, and a general rudeness of tastes and inclinations, which make\r\nthe gulf separating us from the age of Trafalgar wider than that which\r\nseparated the age of Trafalgar from that of the Tudors.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to realize that less than a century ago certain human\r\nbeings—free-born Britons—were treated in a fashion which to-day if it\r\nwas applied to animals would raise a storm of protest from John o’\r\nGroats to the Land’s End: that the fathers of some of us who would\r\nwarmly resent the aspersion of senility were subject to rules and\r\nrestrictions such as we only apply to children and idiots; that at the\r\ndate of Waterloo the efforts of Howard and Mrs. Fry had borne but little\r\nfruit in our prisons; and that thirty years were yet to pass ere the\r\nlast British slave became a free man. Unfortunates were regarded as\r\ncriminals, and treated accordingly, and the man whose only crime was\r\nthat he had fought for his country, received much the same consideration\r\nas the idiot gibbering on the straw of Bedlam.\r\n\r\nIt could not be expected that an age which held forgery and\r\nlinen-stealing to be capital offences; which treated freely-enlisted\r\nsailors and soldiers as animals, civil offenders as lunatics, and\r\nlunatics as dangerous criminals; of which the social life is fairly\r\nreflected in the caricatures of Gillray and Rowlandson; which extolled\r\nmuch conduct which to-day we regard as base and contemptible as actually\r\ndeserving of praise and admiration, should be tenderly disposed towards\r\nthousands of foreigners whose enforced detention in the land added\r\nmillions to taxation, and caused a constant menace to life and property.\r\n\r\nSo, clearly bearing in mind the vast differences between our age and\r\nthat covered in these pages, let us examine some of the recriminations\r\nbetween Britain and France, chiefly on the question of the treatment of\r\nprisoners of war, as a preparation for a more minute survey of the life\r\nof these unfortunates among us, and an equitable judgement thereon.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, prisoners of war were attended to by ‘The Commissioners for\r\ntaking care of sick and wounded seamen and for exchanging Prisoners of\r\nWar’, colloquially known as ‘The Sick and Hurt’ Office, whose business\r\nwas, ‘To see the sick and wounded seamen and prisoners were well cared\r\nfor, to keep exact accounts of money issued to the receiver, to disburse\r\nin the most husbandly manner, and in all things to act as their\r\njudgements and the necessities of the service should require.’ John\r\nEvelyn, Samuel Pepys, and Home, the author of _Douglas_, had been\r\nCommissioners. On December 22, 1799, the care of prisoners of war was\r\ntransferred to the Transport Office, and so remained until 1817. In 1819\r\nthe Victualling Office took over the duty.\r\n\r\nThroughout the period of the Seven Years’ War—that is, from 1756 to\r\n1763—there was a constant interchange of letters upon the subject of the\r\ntreatment of prisoners of war. The French king had made it a rule to\r\ndistribute monthly, from his private purse, money for the benefit of his\r\nsubjects who were prisoners in Britain; this was called the Royal\r\nBounty. It was applied not merely to the relief and comfort of the\r\nprisoners while in confinement, but also to the payment of their\r\nhomeward passages when exchanged, and of certain dues levied on them by\r\nthe British Government upon entering and leaving the country. The\r\npayment was made on a graduated scale, according to rank, by regularly\r\nappointed French agents in England, whose exact and beautifully kept\r\naccounts may be examined at the Archives Nationales in Paris.\r\n\r\nThis Royal Bounty, the French Government asserted, had been inspired by\r\nthe continual complaints about the bad treatment of their countrymen,\r\nprisoners of war in England. To this it was replied that when the French\r\nprisoners arrived it was determined and arranged that they should have\r\nexactly the same victualling both in quality and quantity as British\r\nseamen, and this was actually increased by half a pound of bread per man\r\nper diem over the original allowance. It was asserted that all the\r\nprovisions issued were good, although the bread was not always fresh\r\nbaked. This should be remedied. The meat was the same in quality as that\r\nserved out to British seamen—indeed it was better, for orders were\r\nissued that the prisoners should have fresh meat every meat day (six in\r\nthe week) whereas British seamen had it only twice a week, and sometimes\r\nnot so often.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of the Admiralty expressed their difficulty in\r\nbelieving that the French prisoners were really in need of aid from\r\nFrance, but said that if such aid was forthcoming it should be justly\r\ndistributed by appointed agents.\r\n\r\nThey appended a _Table d’Avitaillement_ to this effect:\r\n\r\nEvery day except Saturday every man received one and a half pounds of\r\nbread, three-quarters of a pound of beef, and one quart of beer. On\r\nSaturday instead of the beef he got four ounces of butter or six ounces\r\nof cheese. Four times a week each man was allowed in addition half a\r\npint of peas.\r\n\r\nFor money allowance officers of men-of-war received one shilling a day,\r\nofficers of privateers and merchant ships sixpence. These officers were\r\non parole, and in drawing up their report the Admiralty officials remark\r\nthat, although they have to regret very frequent breaches of parole,\r\ntheir standard of allowances remains unchanged.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the prison accommodation for the rank and file, at\r\nPortchester Castle, Forton Prison (Portsmouth), Millbay Prison\r\n(Plymouth), the men slept on guard-beds, two feet six inches in breadth,\r\nsix feet in length, provided with a canvas case filled with straw and a\r\ncoverlid. Sick prisoners were treated precisely as were British.\r\n\r\nAt Exeter, Liverpool, and Sissinghurst—‘a mansion house in Kent lately\r\nfitted up for prisoners’—the men slept in hammocks, each with a flock\r\nbed, a blanket, and a coverlid.\r\n\r\nAll this reads excellently, but from the numberless complaints made by\r\nprisoners, after due allowance has been made for exaggeration, I very\r\nmuch doubt if the poor fellows received their full allowance or were\r\nlodged as represented.\r\n\r\nThis was in 1757. As a counterblast to the French remonstrances, our\r\nAdmiralty complained bitterly of the treatment accorded to British\r\nprisoners in French prisons, especially that at Dinan. We quote the\r\nreply of De Moras, the French Administrator, for comparison. The French\r\nscale of provisioning prisoners was as follows:\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday each prisoner received one and\r\na half pounds of bread, one pint of beer at least, one pound of good,\r\nfresh meat, well cooked, consisting of beef, mutton, or veal, ‘without\r\nheads and feet’, soup, salt, and vinegar. On Wednesday, Friday, and\r\nSaturday, and ‘maigre’ days, half a pound of beans or peas well cooked\r\nand seasoned, and two ounces of butter. The same allowance was made in\r\nall prisons, except that in some wine took the place of beer.\r\n\r\nThe Administrator complained that he had great difficulty in getting\r\ncontractors for provisioning prisoners—a fact not without significance\r\nwhen we note how eagerly the position of contractor for prisoners of war\r\nwas competed for in England.\r\n\r\nDe Moras further stated that prisoners when sick were sent to the\r\nregular Service Hospitals, where they received the same attention as\r\nFrenchmen. Each officer prisoner received a money allowance of thirty\r\nsous—one shilling and threepence—a day, and renewed clothing when\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nThe following remonstrance, dated 1758, is one of many relating to\r\nalleged British peculation in the matter of the French Royal Bounty.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Plusieurs Français enfermés dans le château de Portchester représentent\r\nl’excessive longueur de leur détention et ont fait connoître une\r\nmanœuvre qui les prive d’un secours en argent que le Roy leur fait\r\ndonner tous les mois; après avoir changé l’or et l’argent qui leur a été\r\ndonné pour une monnoie de cuivre nommée _half pens_ on en a arrêté le\r\ncours et on les a mis dans l’impossibilité de jouir du soulagement que\r\nle Roy avoit voulu leur accorder.’\r\n\r\n\r\nCommenting upon this De Moras adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Je suis instruit que les châtiments les plus rigoureux sont employés à\r\nl’égard des Français prisonniers pour la faute la plus légère et que\r\ncelui qui cherche à s’évader est chargé de fers, mis en cachot, et perd\r\ntoute espérance de liberté. Je sais que quelques paroles inconsidérées\r\nlâchées contre votre agent à Portsmouth ont excité sa colère au point de\r\nfaire dépouiller 150 Français et de leur faire donner la bastonnade avec\r\nsi peu de ménagements que quelques-uns sont morts des suites de cette\r\nbarbare punition. Quant à la nourriture elle est assés décriée par tous\r\nles Français qui reviennent d’Angleterre, et il est vray que si on leur\r\ndistribue souvent du biscuit aussy mal fabriqué que celuy que\r\nquelques-uns d’eux out raporté, et que j’ay veu, l’usage n’en peut estre\r\nque désagréable et pernicieux. Ils disent aussy que la viande ne vaut\r\npas mieux, et qu’il en est de même de toutes les espèces de denrées.\r\n\r\n‘Je ne l’attribue qu’à l’infidélité et à l’avidité des entrepreneurs.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1758, as a reply to complaints made to the British Government about\r\nthe treatment of prisoners at Portchester, a report to the following\r\neffect was made by De Kergan, an officer of the French East India\r\nCompany on parole.\r\n\r\n1. The chief punishment is the _cachot_, which is wholesomely situated\r\nabove ground near the entrance gate. It is untrue that prisoners are\r\nplaced there in irons.\r\n\r\n2. Prisoners recaptured after escape are put in the _cachot_ upon\r\nhalf-rations until the expenses of recapture and the reward paid for the\r\nsame are made up, but prisoners are never deprived of the French King’s\r\nBounty or debarred the market.\r\n\r\n3. Only three men have lost everything as a result of recapture: one was\r\na lieutenant who had broken parole from Petersfield; the others were two\r\nsailors who defended themselves against Hambledon people who tried to\r\ncapture them, and killed one.\r\n\r\n4. It is utterly untrue that 150 prisoners have been flogged.\r\n\r\n5. The biscuit sent to M. de Moras as a specimen of the prison food did\r\nnot come from Portchester.\r\n\r\n6. He reports well upon the food served out to the prisoners.\r\n\r\n7. All complaints are listened to.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that De Kergan was shortly afterwards allowed to go home\r\nto France with his servant, it is difficult to resist the conclusion\r\nthat it had been ‘arranged’ by the British authorities that he should\r\nhave been selected to make the above report under promise of reward.\r\n\r\nDe Moras adds that although the number of English prisoners multiplies\r\ncontinually, it is owing to the slackness of exchange. On the part of\r\nFrance, he declares that they are all well treated, and asserts that the\r\nbalance of prisoners due to France is 800. Complaints from France about\r\nthe non-distribution of the King’s Bounty are continued during the year\r\n1758 and the following years, and a proposal is made that agents should\r\nbe stationed in each county to attend solely to the proper arrangement\r\nand distribution of all charitable contributions, for the benefit of the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘C’est le seul moyen,’ says De Moras, ‘qui puisse faire goûter aux\r\nofficiers et aux soldats que le sort des armes a privés de la liberté\r\nquelqu’apparence des avantages de la Paix au milieu même des malheurs de\r\nla guerre.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMore complaints from our side brought an answer in which lay the kernel\r\nof the whole matter: ‘L’exactitude des inférieurs demande à estre\r\nsouvent réveillée.’\r\n\r\nIn 1759 the care of the French prisoners in England practically devolved\r\nentirely upon us, as their Government unaccountably withdrew all\r\nsupport. The natural consequence was that their condition became\r\npitiable in the extreme—so much so that public subscriptions were opened\r\non behalf of the poor fellows. A London Committee sat at the _Crown and\r\nAnchor_ in the Strand, and the sum of £7,000 was collected. With this\r\nsum were sent to different prisons 3,131 great coats, 2,034 waistcoats,\r\n3,185 pairs of shoes, 3,054 pairs of breeches, 6,146 shirts, 3,006 caps,\r\nand 3,134 pairs of stockings. Letters of grateful acknowledgement and\r\nthanks were received from most of the dépôts. The following will serve\r\nas a specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ‘_Cornwall_ Man-of-War at Chatham, 13.1.1760.\r\n\r\n‘Nous les prisonniers de guerre à bord du vaisseau du Roi le “Cornwall”,\r\ndans la rivière de Chatham, reconnoissons d’avoir reçu chacun par les\r\nmains de notre bon commandant Guillaume Lefebre des hardes, consistant\r\nd’un surtout, une chemise, un bonnet, une paire de bas, de souliers et\r\nde coulottes. Nous prions MM. les Anglais qui out eu cette bonté pour\r\ninfortunés presque dépourvus auparavant de quoi se garantir de la\r\nsévérité de la saison, et de grandes souffrances par le froid, d’être\r\npersuadés de notre vive reconnoissance qui ne s’oubliera pas.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter of thanks from Sissinghurst contains excuses for some men who\r\nhad sold the clothes thus supplied for urgent necessaries, such as\r\ntobacco and the postage of letters, and praying for the remission of\r\ntheir punishment by being put on half-rations. From Helston, the\r\ncollector, W. Sandys, wrote that ‘in spite of vulgar prejudices which\r\nwere opposed to this charity, and the violent clamours raised against it\r\nby the author of a letter who threw on its promoters the accumulated\r\nreproach of Traitors, Jacobites and Enemies to their country,’ he sent\r\n£32.\r\n\r\nIt was in allusion to the above act of public benevolence that Goldsmith\r\nwrote in the twenty-third letter of the _Citizen of the World_: ‘When I\r\ncast my eye over the list of those who contributed on this occasion, I\r\nfind the names almost entirely English; scarce one foreigner appears\r\namong the number.... I am particularly struck with one who writes these\r\nwords upon the paper enclosing his benefaction: “The mite of an\r\nEnglishman, a citizen of the world, to Frenchmen, prisoners of war, and\r\nnaked.”’\r\n\r\nEven abroad this kindly spirit was appreciated, as appears from the\r\nfollowing extract from a contemporary Brussels gazette:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The animosity of the English against the French decreases. They are now\r\nsupposed to hate only those French who are in arms. A subscription is\r\nopened in the several towns and countries for clothing the French\r\nprisoners now in England, and the example has been followed in the\r\ncapital.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1760 the French Government thus replied to complaints on our side\r\nabout the ill-treatment of British prisoners at Brest.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The castle at Brest has a casemate 22 feet high, 22 feet broad, and 82\r\nlong. It is very dry, having been planked especially and has large\r\nwindows. Prisoners are allowed to go out from morning till evening in a\r\nlarge “meadow” [probably an ironical fancy name for the exercising yard,\r\nsimilar to the name of “Park” given to the open space on the prison\r\nhulks]. They have the same food as the men on the Royal ships: 8 ounces\r\nof meat—a small measure but equal to the English prison ration—the same\r\nwine as on the Royal ships, which is incomparably superior to the small\r\nbeer of England. Every day an examination of the prisoners is made by\r\nthe Commissioner of the Prison, an interpreter and a representative of\r\nthe prisoners. Bedding straw is changed every fifteen days, exactly as\r\nin the Royal Barracks.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHere it is clear that the Frenchman did exactly as the Englishman had\r\ndone. Having to give a reply to a complaint he copied out the Regulation\r\nand sent it, a formal piece of humbug which perhaps deceived and\r\nsatisfied such men in the street as bothered their heads about the fate\r\nof their countrymen, but which left the latter in exactly the same\r\nplight as before.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, with or without foundation, the general impression in\r\nEngland at this time, about 1760, was that such Englishmen as were\r\nunfortunate enough to fall into French hands were very badly treated.\r\nBeatson in his _Naval and Military Memoirs_[1] says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The enemy having swarms of small privateers at sea, captured no less\r\nthan 330 of the British ships.... It is to be lamented that some of\r\ntheir privateers exercised horrid barbarities on their prisoners, being\r\nthe crews of such ships as had presumed to make resistance, and who were\r\nafterwards obliged to submit: Conduct that would have disgraced the most\r\ninfamous pirate; and it would have redounded much to the credit of the\r\nCourt of France to have made public examples of those who behaved in\r\nthis manner. I am afraid, likewise, that there was but too much reason\r\nfor complaint of ill-treatment to the British subjects, even after they\r\nwere landed in France and sent to prison. Of this, indeed, several\r\naffidavits were made by the sufferers when they returned to England.\r\n\r\n‘On the contrary, the conduct of Great Britain was a striking example of\r\ntheir kindness and humanity to such unfortunate persons as were made\r\nprisoners of war. The prisons were situated in wholesome places, and\r\nsubject to public inspection, and the prisoners had every favour shown\r\nthem that prudence would admit of. From the greatness of their number,\r\nit is true, they frequently remained long in confinement before they\r\ncould be exchanged in terms of the cartel, by which their clothes were\r\nreduced to a very bad state, many of them, indeed, almost naked, and\r\nsuffered much from the inclemency of the weather. No sooner, however,\r\nwas their miserable condition in this respect made known, than\r\nsubscriptions for their relief were opened at several of the principal\r\nbanking-houses in London, by which very great sums were procured, and\r\nimmediately applied in purchasing necessaries for those who stood in the\r\ngreatest need of them.\r\n\r\n‘The bad state of the finances of France did not permit that kingdom to\r\ncontinue the allowance they formerly granted for the maintenance of\r\ntheir subjects who might become prisoners of war; but the nation who had\r\nacquired so much glory in overcoming them, had also the generosity to\r\nmaintain such of these unfortunate men as were in her power at the\r\npublic expense.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American prisoners conveyed to England during the War of\r\nIndependence, seem to have been regarded quite as unworthy of proper\r\ntreatment. On April 2, 1777, Benjamin Franklin and Silas Deane wrote\r\nfrom Paris to Lord Stormont, British Ambassador in Paris, on the subject\r\nof the ill-treatment of American prisoners in England, and said that\r\nsevere reprisals would be justifiable. On this a writer in the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, October 1777, commented:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It must certainly be a matter of some difficulty to dispose of such a\r\nnumber of prisoners as are daily taken from captured American\r\nprivateers; some of whom have from 100 to 300 men on board, few less\r\nthan 70 or 80; against whom the Americans can have no adequate number to\r\nexchange.... Were the privateersmen, therefore, to be treated as\r\nprisoners of war, our gaols would be too few to hold them. What then is\r\nto be done? Not indeed to load them with chains, or force them with\r\nstripes, famine, or other cruelties, as the letter charges, to enlist in\r\nGovernment service; but to allow them the same encouragement with other\r\nsubjects to enter on board the King’s ships, and then they would have no\r\nplea to complain of hard usage.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter referred to, sent on by Stormont to Lord North, contained the\r\nchief grievance that ‘stripes had been inflicted on some to make them\r\ncommit the deepest of all crimes—the fighting against the liberties of\r\ntheir country’. The reply to this was the stereotyped one ‘that all\r\npossible was done for the prisoners: that they were permitted to receive\r\ncharitable donations, and that complaints were attended to promptly’. A\r\ncontemporary number of the _London Packet_ contains a list of\r\nsubscriptions for the benefit of the American prisoners amounting to\r\n£4,600. The Committee for the collection and administration of this\r\nmoney, who sat at the _King’s Arms_ at Cornhill, seem to have occupied\r\nthemselves further, for in 1778 they call attention to the fact that one\r\nEbenezer Smith Platt, a Georgia merchant, had been put in Newgate, and\r\nironed, and placed in that part of the prison occupied by thieves,\r\nhighwaymen, housebreakers, and murderers, without any allowance for food\r\nor clothes, and must have perished but for private benevolence.\r\n\r\nThe most absurd reports of the brutal treatment of French prisoners in\r\nEngland were circulated in France. It was gravely reported to the\r\nDirectory that English doctors felt the pulses of French prisoner\r\npatients with the ends of their canes; that prisoners were killed _en\r\nmasse_ when subsistence became difficult; that large numbers were\r\npunished for the faults of individuals; and that the mortality among\r\nthem was appalling. The result was that the Directory sent over M.\r\nVochez to inquire into matters. The gross calumnies were exposed to him;\r\nhe was allowed free access to prisons and prison ships; it was proved to\r\nhim that out of an average total of 4,500 prisoners on the hulks at\r\nPortsmouth only six had died during the past quarter, and, expressing\r\nhimself as convinced, he returned, promising to report to the French\r\nminister the ‘gross misrepresentations which had been made to him’.\r\n\r\nA good specimen of the sort of report which sent M. Vochez over to\r\nEngland is the address of M. Riou to the Council of Five Hundred of the\r\n5th of Pluviôse of the year 6—that is January 25, 1798.\r\n\r\nAfter a violent tirade against England and her evil sway in the world,\r\nhe goes into details. He says that when his Government complained of the\r\npromiscuous herding together of officers and men as prisoners of war,\r\nthe English reply was: ‘You are republicans. You want equality,\r\ntherefore we treat you here equally.’ Alluding to the harsh treatment of\r\nprivateersmen taken prisoners, he declares it is because they do more\r\nharm to England by striking at her commerce than any fleets or armies.\r\nHe brings up the usual complaints about bad and insanitary prisons,\r\ninsufficient food, and the shameful treatment of officers on parole by\r\nthe country people. One hundred Nantes captains and officers had told\r\nhim that prisoners were confined in parties of seventy-two in huts\r\nseventeen feet long and ten feet high, some of them being merely cellars\r\nin the hillside; that the water soaked through hammocks, straw, and\r\nbread; that there was no air, that all this was light suffering compared\r\nwith the treatment they received daily from agents, officers, soldiers,\r\nand jailors, who on the slightest pretext fired upon the prisoners. ‘Un\r\njour, à Plymouth même, un prisonnier ajusté par un soldat fut tué. On\r\nenvoie chercher le commissaire. Il vient: soulève le cadavre: on lui\r\ndemande justice; il répond: “C’est un Français,” et se retire!’\r\n\r\nAlluding to the precautionary order which had been recently given in\r\nEngland that all parole should cease, and that all officers on parole\r\nshould be sent to prisons and prison ships, he says: ‘There is now no\r\nparole for officers. All are pell-mell together, of all ranks and of\r\nboth sexes. A woman was delivered of a child, she was left forty-eight\r\nhours without attention, and even a glass of water was denied her. Even\r\nthe body of a dead dog was fought for by the famished prisoners.’\r\n\r\nHe then describes in glowing terms the treatment of English prisoners in\r\nFrance; he suggests a tax for the relief of the French prisoners of war,\r\na ‘taxe d’humanité,’ being one-third of the ordinary sumptuary tax, and\r\nwinds up his attack:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Français! Vous avez déposé une foule d’offrandes sur l’autel de la\r\nPatrie! Ce ne sera pas tromper vos intentions que de les employer au\r\nsoulagement de l’humanité souffrante. Vous voulez combattre\r\nl’Angleterre: eh bien! Soulagez les victimes; conservez 22,000\r\nRépublicains qui un jour tourneront contre leurs oppresseurs leurs bras\r\ndirigés par la Vengeance! N’oubliez pas que le Gouvernement anglais\r\nmédite la ruine de la République; que, familiarisé avec tous les crimes,\r\nil en inventera de nouveaux pour essayer de la renverser; mais elle\r\nrestera triomphante, et le Gouvernement anglais sera détruit! Attaquez\r\nce monstre! Il expirera sous vos coups! Quirot, Le Clerc\r\n(Maine-et-Loire), Riou.’\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Times_ of January 8, 1798, comments severely upon the frequent\r\ntirades of the Directory, ridiculing the attitude of a Government\r\nremarkable above all others for its despotic character and its wholesale\r\nviolation of the common rights of man, as a champion of philanthropy, of\r\nmorals, and of humanity, and its appeal to all nations to unite against\r\nthe only country which protects the victims of Directorial anarchy.\r\nAfter declaring that the prisoners in England are treated better than\r\nprisoners of war ever were treated before, a fact admitted by all\r\nreasonable Frenchmen, the writer says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘And yet the Directory dares to state officially in the face of Europe\r\nthat the Cabinet of St. James has resolved to withdraw all means of\r\nsubsistence from 22,000 Republican prisoners in England, and has shut\r\nthem up in dungeons, as if such a measure, supposing it even to be true,\r\ncould have any other object than to force the French Government to\r\nprovide for the sustenance of the French prisoners in this country in\r\nthe same manner as our Government does with respect to the English\r\nprisoners in France.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 1798 the French Directory announced through Barras, the\r\npresident, that it would undertake the subsistence of the French\r\nprisoners in England, meaning by subsistence, provisions, clothing,\r\nmedical attendance, and to make good all depredations by prisoners.\r\n\r\n_The Times_ of February 27 said:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The firm conduct of our Government in refusing any longer to make\r\nadvances for the maintenance of French prisoners, has had the good\r\neffect of obliging the French Directory to come forward with the\r\nnecessary supplies, and as the French agents have now the full\r\nmanagement of this concern, we shall no longer be subject to their\r\nodious calumnies against the humanity of this country.’\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly the French Government took over the task of feeding and\r\nclothing the prisoners in England, they reduced the daily rations by one\r\nquarter. This irritated the prisoners extremely, and it was said by them\r\nthat they preferred the ‘atrocious cruelty of the despot of London to\r\nthe humanity and measures of the Five Directors of Paris’. A\r\ncorrespondent of _The Times_ of March 16, 1798, signing himself\r\n‘Director’, said that under the previous British victualling régime, a\r\nprisoner on his release showed the sum of four guineas which he had made\r\nby the sale of superfluous provisions, and the same writer declared that\r\nit had come to his knowledge that the new French provision agent had\r\nmade overtures to the old British contractor to supply inferior meat.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 it was resolved in the House of Commons that an inquiry should\r\nbe made to establish the truth or the reverse of the French complaints\r\nabout the treatment of French prisoners in England. It was stated that\r\nthe reports spread about in France were purposely exaggerated in order\r\nto inflame national feeling against Britain. Mr. Huskisson confirmed\r\nthis and alluded to the abominable treatment of Sir Sydney Smith.\r\n\r\nColonel Stanley affirmed that the prisoners were generally well treated:\r\nhe had lately been in Liverpool where 6,000 were confined, and found the\r\nofficers had every indulgence, three billiard tables, and that they\r\noften performed plays.\r\n\r\nIn May 1798 the Report was drawn up. After hearing evidence and making\r\nevery inquiry it was found that the French complaints were gross\r\nexaggerations; the Commissioners observed that ‘our prisoners in France\r\nwere treated with a degree of inhumanity and rigour unknown in any\r\nformer war, and unprecedented in the annals of civilized nations’, and\r\nreiterated the complaint that all British proposals for the exchange of\r\nprisoners were rejected.\r\n\r\nThe Report stated that there was good medical attendance given to\r\nprisoners in Britain; that there were constant checks on fraud by\r\ncontractors and officials; that the prisoners appointed their own\r\ninspector of rations; that fraudulent contractors were proceeded\r\nagainst, and punished, giving as a recent example, a Plymouth contractor\r\nwho, having failed in his engagements to supply the prisons with good\r\nprovisions of full weight, was imprisoned for six months and fined £300.\r\n\r\nThe Report stated that the daily scale of provisions for prisoners in\r\nhealth was: one and a half pounds of bread, three-quarters of a pound of\r\nbeef, one-third of an ounce of salt, and one quart of beer, except on\r\nSaturdays, when four ounces of butter and six ounces of cheese were\r\nsubstituted; and on four days of the week half a pint of pease, or in\r\nlieu one pound of cabbage stripped from the stalk.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners selected their own surgeons if they chose, and the same\r\ndiet was given to sick prisoners as to sick British seamen. Each man was\r\nprovided with a hammock, a palliasse, a bolster and a blanket, the straw\r\nof bolsters and palliasses being frequently changed.\r\n\r\nA letter written in 1793 to the Supplement of the _Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine_, holds good for 1798, as to the belief of the man in the\r\nstreet that the foregoing liberal and humane regulations were worth more\r\nthan the paper they were written on:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Sans Culottes we hold in prison never lived so well in their lives\r\nbefore: they are allowed every day three-quarters of a pound of good\r\nbeef, two pounds of bread with all the finest of the flour in it, the\r\nbran alone being extracted, two quarts of strong well-relished soup, one\r\npound of cabbage with the heart included, and a quart of good beer. As a\r\nFrenchman can live upon one pound of meat for a week, this allowance is\r\nover-plenteous, and the prisoners sell more than half of it. With the\r\nmoney so obtained they buy as much strong beer as they can get leave to\r\nhave brought them.... Such is the manner in which Englishmen are at this\r\njuncture treating their natural, inveterate, and unalterable enemies.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 22, 1799, the French Government—now the Consulate—repudiated\r\nthe arrangement made by the Directory for the subsistence of French\r\nwar-prisoners in England, and the British Government was obliged to\r\nundertake the task, the Transport Office now replacing the old ‘Sick and\r\nHurt’ Office. So the prisoner committees in the dépôts and prisons were\r\nabolished, and all persons who, under the previous arrangement, were\r\nunder the French agents and contractors, and as such had been allowed\r\npassports, returned to their original prisoner status.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Portland wrote thus to the Admiralty:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It is less necessary on this occasion to recall the circumstances which\r\ngave rise to the arrangement under which the two Governments agreed to\r\nprovide for the wants of their respective subjects during their\r\ndetention, as they have been submitted to Parliament and published to\r\nthe world in refutation of the false and unwarrantable assertions\r\nbrought forward by the French Government on this subject; but His\r\nMajesty cannot witness the termination of an arrangement founded on the\r\nfairest principles of Justice and Protection due by the Powers of War to\r\ntheir respective Prisoners, and proved by experience to be the best\r\ncalculated to provide for their comfort, without protesting against the\r\ndeparture (on the part of the French Government) from an agreement\r\nentered into between the two countries, and which tended so materially\r\nto mitigate the Calamities of War. To prevent this effect as much as\r\npossible with respect to the British prisoners now in France, it is His\r\nMajesty’s pleasure that Capt. Cotes should be instructed to ascertain\r\nexactly the rate of daily allowance made to each man by the French\r\nGovernment, and that he should take care to supply at the expense of\r\nthis country any difference that may exist between such allowance and\r\nwhat was issued by him under the late arrangement.\r\n\r\n‘With respect to all the prisoners not on Parole in this country, it is\r\nHis Majesty’s command that from the date of the French agent ceasing to\r\nsupply them, the Commissioners of Transports and for taking care of\r\nprisoners of war shall furnish them immediately with the same ration of\r\nProvisions as were granted before the late arrangement took place.’\r\n\r\n\r\n(Not clothing, as this had always been supplied by the French\r\nGovernment.)\r\n\r\nPrevious to this repudiatory act of France, the British Government made\r\na similar proposal to Holland, accompanying it with the following\r\nremarks, which certainly seem to point to a desire to do the best\r\npossible to minimize the misery of the unfortunate men.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We trust that your Government will not reject so humane a proposition,\r\nwhich, if accepted, will, of course, preclude the possibility of\r\ncomplaints or recriminations between the respective Governments, and\r\nprobably meliorate the fate of every individual to which it relates. In\r\nhealth their mode of living will be more conformable to their former\r\nhabits. In sickness they will be less apt to mistrust the skill of their\r\nattendants, or to question the interest they may take in their\r\npreservation. On all occasions they would be relieved from the suspicion\r\nthat the Hand which supplies their wants and ministers to their comfort,\r\nis directed by that spirit of Hostility which is too often the\r\nconsequence of the Prejudice and Enmity excited by the State of War\r\nbetween Nations.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the Dutch Government, no doubt acting under orders from\r\nwithout, replied that it was impossible to comply. So Dutch prisoners\r\nbecame also the objects of our national charity.\r\n\r\nThe _Moniteur_ thus defended the Act of Repudiation:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The notification of the abandonment by the French Government of the\r\nsupport of French prisoners in England is in conformity with the common\r\ncustoms of war, and is an act of wise administration and good policy.\r\nThe old Directory is perhaps the first Government which set the example\r\nof a belligerent power supporting its prisoners upon the territories of\r\nits enemies ... Men must have seen in this new arrangement a sort of\r\ninsult. The English papers of that time were filled with bitter\r\ncomplaints, with almost official justification of this conduct,\r\nsupported by most authentic proofs. Well-informed men saw with surprise\r\nthe French Government abandon itself blindly to these impolitic\r\nsuggestions, release the English from the expense and embarrassment of\r\nmaking burthensome advances, exhaust of its own accord the remains of\r\nits specie in order to send it to England; deprive themselves of the\r\npecuniary resources of which they stood in such pressing need, in order\r\nto add to the pecuniary resources of its enemies; and, in short, to\r\nsupport the enormous expenses of administration.\r\n\r\n‘The English, while they exclaimed against the injustice of the\r\naccusation, gathered with pleasure the fruits of this error of the\r\nDirectory; though our old Monarchical Government left England during the\r\nwhole war to support the expenses of the prisoners, and did not\r\nliquidate the balance until the return of Peace, and consequently of\r\ncirculation, credit, commerce, and plenty, rendered the payment more\r\neasy. The generally received custom of leaving to the humanity of\r\nbelligerent nations the care of protecting and supporting prisoners\r\nmarks the progress of civilization.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of repudiation by France of the care of French prisoners in\r\nEngland were not long in showing themselves.\r\n\r\nThe agent at Portchester Castle wrote to the Transport Office:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          ‘August, 1800.\r\n\r\n ‘GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\n‘I am under the necessity of laying before you the miserable situation\r\nof a great number of Prisoners at this Depôt for want of clothing. Many\r\nof them are entirely naked, and others have to cut up their hammocks to\r\ncover themselves. Their situation is such, that if not provided with\r\nthese articles before the cold weather commences they must inevitably\r\nperish.\r\n\r\n‘I beg to observe that it is nearly eighteen months since they were\r\nfurnished with any article of wearing apparel by the French Government,\r\nand then only a single shirt to each suit which must necessarily have\r\nbeen worn out long since.\r\n\r\n                                                         JOHN HOLMWOOD.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again, later on:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The prisoners are reduced to a state of dreadful meagreness. A great\r\nnumber of them have the appearance of walking skeletons. One has been\r\nfound dead in his hammock, and another fell out from mere debility and\r\nwas killed by the fall. The great part of those sent to the hospital die\r\nin a short time, others as soon as they are received there.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were written in consequence of letters of complaint from\r\nprisoners. The Agent in France for prisoners of war in England, Niou,\r\nwas communicated with, but no reply came. Otto, the Commissioner of the\r\nRepublic in England, however, said that as the French Government clothed\r\nBritish prisoners, _although they were not exactly British prisoners but\r\nallies_, it was our duty to clothe French prisoners. The British\r\nGovernment denied this, saying that _we_ clothed our allies when\r\nprisoners abroad, and ascribed much of the misery among the French\r\nprisoners to their irrepressible gambling habits. Dundas wrote a long\r\nletter to the French Commissioners about the neglect of their\r\nGovernment, but added that out of sheer compassion the British\r\nGovernment would supply the French prisoners with sufficient clothing.\r\nLord Malmesbury hinted that the prisoners were refused the chance of\r\nredress by the difficulty of gaining access to their Commissary, which\r\nGrenville stated was absolutely untrue, and that the commonest soldier\r\nor sailor had entire freedom of access to his representative.\r\n\r\nOn October 29, 1800, Otto, the French Commissioner in England, wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘My letter from Liverpool states that the number of deaths during the\r\npast month has greatly exceeded that of four previous months, even when\r\nthe depôt contained twice the number of prisoners. This sudden mortality\r\nwhich commenced at the close of last month, is the consequence of the\r\nfirst approach of cold weather, all, without exception, having failed\r\nfrom debility. The same fate awaits many more of these unfortunate\r\nbeings, already half starved from want of proper food, and obliged to\r\nsleep upon a damp pavement or a few handfuls of rotten straw. Hunger and\r\ntheir own imprudence, deprived them of their clothes, and now the effect\r\nof the cold weather obliges them to part with a share of their scanty\r\nsubsistence to procure clothing. In one word, their only hope is a\r\nchange in their situation or death.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this account Otto admits that the prisoners’ ‘imprudence’ has largely\r\nbrought about the state of affairs. Rupert George, Ambrose Serle, and\r\nJohn Schenck, the Transport Office Commissioners who had been sent to\r\ninquire, report confirming the misery, and re-affirm its chief cause.\r\nAbout Stapleton Prison they say:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Those who are not quite ragged and half naked, are generally very dirty\r\nin their scanty apparel, and make a worse appearance as to health than\r\nthey would do had they the power in such a dress to be clean. Profligacy\r\nand gambling add to the distress of many, and it is perhaps impossible\r\nto prevent or restrain this spirit, which can exercise itself in\r\ncorners. The Dutch prisoners at Stapleton (1800), being clothed by the\r\nDutch Government are in much better health than the French.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners sent to Otto an extract of a letter from Forton, near\r\nGosport. Griffin, the prison surgeon, says that ‘several prisoners have\r\nbeen received into the Hospital in a state of great debility owing to\r\ntheir having disposed of their ration of provisions for a week, a\r\nfortnight, and in some instances for a month at a time. We have felt it\r\nour duty to direct that such persons as may be discovered to have been\r\nconcerned in purchasing any article of provision, clothing or bedding,\r\nof another prisoner, should be confined in the Black Hole and kept on\r\nshort allowance for ten days and also be marked as having forfeited\r\ntheir turn of exchange.’\r\n\r\nCallous, almost brutal, according to our modern standards, as was the\r\ngeneral character of the period covered by this history, it must not be\r\ninferred therefrom that all sympathy was withheld from the unfortunate\r\nmen condemned to be prisoners on our shores. We have seen how generously\r\nthe British public responded to the call for aid in the cases of the\r\nFrench prisoners of 1759, and of the Americans of 1778; we shall see in\r\nthe progress of this history how very largely the heart of the country\r\npeople of Britain went out to the prisoners living on parole amongst\r\nthem, and I think my readers may accept a letter which I am about to put\r\nbefore them as evidence that a considerable section of the British\r\npublic was of opinion that the theory and practice of our system with\r\nregard to prisoners of war was not merely wrong, but wicked, and that\r\nvery drastic reform was most urgently needed.\r\n\r\nSome readers may share the opinion of the French General Pillet, which I\r\nappend to the letter, that the whole matter—the writing of the anonymous\r\nletter, and the prosecution and punishment of the newspaper editor who\r\npublished it, was a trick of the Government to blind the public eye to\r\nfacts, and that the fact that the Government should have been driven to\r\nhave recourse to it, pointed to their suspicion that the public had more\r\nthan an inkling that it was being hoodwinked.\r\n\r\nIn the _Statesman_ newspaper of March 19, 1812, appeared the following\r\narticle:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Our unfortunate prisoners in France have now been in captivity nine\r\nyears, and, while the true cause of their detention shall remain unknown\r\nto the country there cannot be any prospect of their restoration to\r\ntheir families and homes. In some journeys I have lately made I have had\r\nrepeated opportunities of discovering the infamous practices which\r\nproduce the present evil, and render our exiled countrymen the hopeless\r\nvictims of misery....’\r\n\r\n\r\n(The writer then describes the two classes of prisoners of war in\r\nEngland.)\r\n\r\n\r\n‘They are all under the care of the Transport Office who has the\r\nmanagement of the money for their maintenance, which amounts to an\r\nenormous sum (more than three millions per annum) of which a large part\r\nis not converted to the intended purpose, but is of clear benefit to the\r\nCommissioners and their employers. The prisoners on parole receiving\r\n1_s._ 6_d._ per diem produce comparatively little advantage to the\r\nCommissioners, who are benefited principally by the remittances these\r\nprisoners receive from France, keeping their money five or six months,\r\nand employing it in stock-jobbing. They gain still something from these,\r\nhowever, by what their agents think proper to send them of the property\r\nof those who die or run away. The prisoners in close confinement are\r\nvery profitable. These prisoners are allowed by the Government once in\r\neighteen months a complete suit of clothing, which however, they never\r\nreceive. Those, therefore, among them who have any covering have bought\r\nit with the product of their industry, on which the Agents make enormous\r\nprofits. Those who have no genius or no money go naked, and there are\r\nmany in this deplorable state. Such a picture Humanity revolts at, but\r\nit is a true one, for the produce of the clothing goes entirely into the\r\npockets of the Commissioners.\r\n\r\n‘A certain amount of bread, meat, &c., of good quality ought to be\r\nfurnished to each prisoner every day. They receive these victuals, but\r\nthey are generally of bad quality, and there is always something wanting\r\nin the quantity—as one half or one third at least, which is of great\r\namount. Besides, when any person is punished, he receives only one half\r\nof what is called a portion. These measures, whenever taken, produce\r\nabout £250 or £300 a day in each depôt according to the number of\r\nprisoners, and of course, are found necessary very often. These are the\r\nregular and common profits. The Commissioners receive besides large sums\r\nfor expenses of every description which have never been incurred in the\r\ncourse of the year, and find means to clear many hundreds of thousands\r\nof pounds to share with their employers.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer goes on to say that\r\n\r\n\r\n‘the real reason for bringing so many prisoners into the country is not\r\nmilitary, but to enrich themselves [i.e. the Government]. For the same\r\nreason they keep the San Domingo people of 1803, who, by a solemn\r\ncapitulation of Aux Cayes were to be returned to France. So with the\r\ncapitulation of Cap François, who were sent home in 1811 as\r\nclandestinely as possible. Bonaparte could say ditto to us if any of\r\nours capitulated in Spain like the Duke of York in Holland.\r\n\r\n‘All this is the reason why our people in France are so badly treated,\r\nand it is not to be wondered at.\r\n\r\n                                                             ‘HONESTUS.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Transport Office deemed the plain-speaking on the part of an\r\ninfluential journal so serious that the opinion of the Attorney-General\r\nwas asked, and he pronounced it to be ‘a most scandalous libel and ought\r\nto be prosecuted’. So the proprietor was proceeded against, found\r\nguilty, fined £500, imprisoned in Newgate for eighteen months, and had\r\nto find security for future good behaviour, himself in £1,000, and two\r\nsureties in £500 each.\r\n\r\nI add the remarks of General Pillet, a prisoner on a Chatham hulk, upon\r\nthis matter. They are from his book _L’Angleterre, vue à Londres et dans\r\nses provinces, pendant un séjour de dix années, dont six comme\r\nprisonnier de guerre_—a book utterly worthless as a record of facts, and\r\ninfected throughout with the most violent spirit of Anglophobism, but\r\nnot without value for reference concerning many details which could only\r\ncome under the notice of a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Lovel, editor of the _Statesman_, a paper generally inclined in\r\nfavour of the French Government, had published in March 19, 1812, a\r\nletter signed “Honestus”, in which the writer detailed with an exactness\r\nwhich showed he was thoroughly informed, the different sorts of\r\nrobberies committed by the Transport Office and its agents upon the\r\nFrench prisoners, and summed them up. According to him these robberies\r\namounted to several millions of francs: the budget of the cost of the\r\nprisoners being about 24,000,000 francs. Mr. Lovel was prosecuted.\r\n“Honestus” preserved his anonymity; the editor was, in consequence,\r\ncondemned to two years imprisonment and a heavy fine. His defence was\r\nthat the letter had been inserted without his knowledge and that he had\r\nhad no idea who was the author. I have reason to believe, without being\r\nabsolutely sure, that the writer was one Adams, an employé who had been\r\ndismissed from the Transport Office, a rascal all the better up in the\r\ndetails which he gave in that he had acted as interpreter of all the\r\nprisoners’ correspondence, the cause of his resentment being that he had\r\nbeen replaced by Sugden, even a greater rascal than he. I wrote to Mr.\r\nBrougham, Lovel’s Solicitor, and sent him a regular sworn statement that\r\nthe prisoners did not receive one quarter the clothing nominally served\r\nto them, and for which probably the Government paid; that, estimating an\r\noutfit to be worth £1, this single item alone meant the robbery every\r\neighteen months of about £1,800,000. My letter, as I expected, produced\r\nno effect; there was no desire to be enlightened on the affair, and the\r\njudicial proceedings were necessary to clear the Transport Office in the\r\neyes of the French Government. Hence the reason for the severe\r\npunishment of Lovel, whose fine, I have been assured, was partly paid by\r\nthe Transport Office, by a secret agreement.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General, after some remarks about the very different way in which\r\nsuch an affair would have been conducted in France, appends a note\r\nquoting the case of General Virion, who, on being accused of cruelty and\r\nrapacity towards the English prisoners in Verdun, blew his brains out\r\nrather than face the disgrace of a trial.\r\n\r\nPillet wrote to Lovel, the editor, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  ‘On board the prison ship _Brunswick_,\r\n                                      Chatham, May 19, 1813.\r\n\r\n ‘SIR:\r\n\r\n‘Since I have become acquainted with the business of the letter of\r\n“Honestus” I have been filled with indignation against the coward who,\r\nhaving seemed to wish to expose the horrible truth about the character\r\nand amount of the robberies practised upon prisoners of war, persists in\r\nmaintaining his incognito when you have asked him to come forward in\r\nyour justification.... Unhappily, we are Frenchmen, and it seems to be\r\nregarded in this country as treason to ask justice for us, and that\r\nbecause it is not possible to exterminate France altogether, the noblest\r\nact of patriotism seems to consist in assassinating French prisoners\r\nindividually, by adding to the torments of a frightful imprisonment\r\nprivations of all sorts, and thefts of clothing of which hardly a\r\nquarter of the proper quantity is distributed....\r\n\r\n‘We have asked for impartial inquiries to be made by people not in the\r\npay of the Admiralty; we have declared that we could reveal acts\r\nhorrible enough to make hairs stand on end, and that we could bring\r\nunimpeachable witnesses to support our testimony. These demands, even\r\nwhen forwarded by irreproachable persons, have been received in silence.\r\nIs it possible that there are not in England more determined men to put\r\na stop to ill-doing from a sense of duty and irrespective of rank or\r\nnation? Is it possible that not a voice shall ever be raised on our\r\nbehalf?\r\n\r\n‘Your condemnation makes me fear it is so.\r\n\r\n‘If only one good man, powerful, and being resolved to remove shame from\r\nhis country, and to wash out the blot upon her name caused by the\r\nknowledge throughout Europe of what we suffer, could descend a moment\r\namong us, and acquaint himself with the details of our miseries with the\r\nobject of relieving them, what good he would do humanity, and what a\r\nclaim he would establish to our gratitude!’\r\n\r\n\r\nPillet adds in a note:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Lord Cochrane in 1813 wished to examine the prison ships at Portsmouth.\r\nAlthough he was a member of Parliament, and a captain in the navy,\r\npermission was refused him, because the object of his visit was to\r\nascertain the truth about the ill-treatment of the prisoners. Lord\r\nCochrane is anything but an estimable man, but he is one of those who,\r\nin the bitterness of their hatred of the party in power, sometimes do\r\ngood. He complained in Parliament, and the only reply he got was that as\r\nthe hulks were under the administration of the Transport Office, it\r\ncould admit or refuse whomsoever it chose to inspect them.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                       THE EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom first to last the question of the Exchange of Prisoners was a\r\nburning one between Great Britain and her enemies, and, despite all\r\nefforts to arrange it upon an equitable basis and to establish its\r\npractice, it was never satisfactorily settled. It is difficult for an\r\nEnglishman, reviewing the evidence as a whole and in as impartial a\r\nspirit as possible, to arrive at any other conclusion than that we were\r\nnot so fairly dealt with by others as we dealt with them. We allowed\r\nFrench, Danish, and Dutch officers to go on parole to their own\r\ncountries, which meant that they were on their honour to return to\r\nEngland if they were not exchanged by a certain date, and we continued\r\nto do so in face of the fact that violation of this pledge was the rule\r\nand not the exception, and that prominent officers of the army and navy\r\nwere not ashamed thus to sin. Or we sent over shiploads of foreigners,\r\neach of whom had been previously arranged for as exchanged, but so often\r\ndid the cartel ships, as they were called, return empty or without\r\nequivalent numbers from the French ports that the balance of exchange\r\nwas invariably heavily against Britain. The transport of prisoners for\r\nwhom exchanges had been arranged, and of invalids and boys, was by means\r\nof cartel ships which were hired, or contracted for, by Government for\r\nthis particular service, and were subject to the strictest regulation\r\nand supervision. The early cartel ports were Dover, Poole, and Falmouth\r\non this side; Calais, St. Malo, Havre, and Morlaix in France, but during\r\nthe Napoleonic wars Morlaix was the French port, Plymouth, Lynn,\r\nDartmouth, and Portsmouth being those of England. The French ports were\r\nselected with the idea of rendering the marches of exchanged prisoners\r\nto their districts as easy as possible.\r\n\r\nA cartel ship was not allowed to carry guns or arms, nor any\r\nmerchandise; if it did the vessel was liable to be seized. The national\r\nflag of the port of destination was to be flown at the fore-top-gallant\r\nmast, and the ship’s flag on the ensign staff, and both were to be kept\r\ncontinually flying. Passengers were not allowed to carry letters, nor,\r\nif from England, gold coin; the latter restriction being imposed so as\r\npartially to check the lucrative trade of guinea-running, as, during the\r\nearly nineteenth century, on account of the scarcity of gold in France,\r\nthere was such a premium upon British guineas that the smuggling of them\r\nengaged a large section of the English coast community, who were\r\nfrequently backed up by London houses of repute. Passengers going to\r\nFrance on their own account paid £5 5_s._ each, with a deposit against\r\ndemurrage on account of possible detention in the French port at one\r\nguinea per day, the demurrage being deducted from the deposit and the\r\nbalance returned to the passenger.\r\n\r\nThe early cartel rates were, from Dover to Calais, 6_s._ per head;\r\nbetween all the Channel ports 10_s._ 6_d._, and to ports out of the\r\nChannel, £1 1_s._ For this the allowance of food was one and a half\r\npounds of bread, three-quarters of a pound of meat, and two quarts of\r\nbeer or one quart of wine, except between Dover and Calais, where for\r\nthe meat was substituted four ounces of butter or six ounces of cheese.\r\nCommanding officers had separate cabins; a surgeon was compulsorily\r\ncarried; officers and surgeon messed at the captain’s table. It was\r\nnecessary that the ship should be provisioned sufficiently for an\r\nemergency, and it was especially ruled that if a ship should be delayed\r\nbeyond sailing time owing to weather or incomplete number of passengers,\r\nnobody upon any pretence was to leave the ship.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, on account of the discomforts and even the dangers of the\r\ncartel service, as well as the abuse of it by parole-breakers and\r\nothers, a request was made that a naval officer should accompany each\r\ncartel ship, but this was refused by the Admiralty upon the ground that\r\nas such he might be arrested upon reaching a French port. As it became\r\nsuspected that between the cartel shipowners and captains and the escape\r\nagents a very close business understanding existed, it was ordered in\r\nthis same year, 1808, that all foreigners found about sea-port towns on\r\nthe plea that they were exchanged prisoners waiting for cartel ships,\r\nshould be arrested, and that the batches of exchanged prisoners should\r\nbe timed to reach the ports so that they should not have to wait.\r\n\r\nLater, when practically Plymouth and Morlaix had a monopoly of the\r\ncartel traffic, the cartel owner received uniformly half a guinea per\r\nman if his carriage-rate was one man per ton of his burthen; and seven\r\nshillings and sixpence if at the more usual rate of three men to two\r\ntons, and for victualling was allowed fourteen pence per caput per diem.\r\n\r\nIn 1757 much correspondence between the two Governments took place upon\r\nthe subjects of the treatment and exchange of prisoners, which may be\r\nseen at the Archives Nationales in Paris, resulting in a conference\r\nbetween M. de Marmontel and M. de Moras, Minister of Marine and\r\nController-General of Finances, and Vanneck & Co., agents in England for\r\nFrench affairs. Nothing came of it except an admission by the French\r\nthat in one respect their countrymen in England were better treated than\r\nwere the English prisoners in France, in that whereas the French\r\nprisoners were provided with mattresses and coverlids, the English were\r\nonly given straw. England claimed the right of monopolizing the\r\nsea-carriage of prisoners; and this France very naturally refused, but\r\nagreed to the other clauses that king’s officers should be preferred to\r\nall other in exchange, that women and children under twelve should be\r\nsent without exchange, and that in hospitals patients should have\r\nseparate beds and coverlids. But after a long exchange of requests and\r\nreplies, complaints and accusations, England ceased to reply, and\r\nmatters were at a standstill.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 there was a correspondence between M. de Moras and M. de\r\nMarmontel which shows that in these early days the principle of the\r\nexchange of prisoners possessed honourable features which were\r\nremarkably wanting on the French side during the later struggles between\r\nthe two countries. Three French ‘broke-paroles’ who in accordance with\r\nthe custom of the time should, when discovered, have been sent back to\r\nEngland, could not be found. M. de Moras suggested that in this case\r\nthey should imitate the action of the British authorities in Jersey,\r\nwho, unable to find nine English prisoners who had escaped from Dinan,\r\nstolen a fishing-boat, and got over to Jersey, had sent back the stolen\r\nvessel and nine French prisoners as an equivalent.\r\n\r\nThe following was the passport form for French prisoners whose exchange\r\nhad been effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘By the Commissioners for taking care of sick and wounded seamen, and\r\nfor Exchanging Prisoners of War.\r\n\r\n‘Whereas the one person named and described on the back hereof is\r\nDischarged from being Prisoner of War to proceed from London to France\r\nby way of Ostend in exchange for the British prisoner also named and\r\ndescribed on the back hereof; you and every of you (_sic_) are hereby\r\ndesired to suffer the said Discharged Person to pass from London to\r\nFrance accordingly without any hindrance or molestation whatever. This\r\npassport to continue in force for six days from the date of these\r\npresents.\r\n\r\n                                                        ‘June 3rd. 1757.\r\n\r\n‘To all and Singular the King’s officers Civil and Military,\r\nand to those of all the Princes and States in Alliance with\r\nHis Majesty.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1758 the complaints of the French Government about the unsatisfactory\r\nstate of the prisoner exchange system occupy many long letters. ‘Il est\r\ntrop important de laisser subsister une pareille inaction dans les\r\néchanges; elle est préjudiciable aux deux Puissances, et fâcheuse aux\r\nfamilles’, is one remark. On the other hand, the complaint went from our\r\nside that we sent over on one occasion 219 French prisoners, and only\r\ngot back 143 British, to which the French replied: ‘Yes: but your 143\r\nwere all sound men, whereas the 219 you sent us were invalids, boys, and\r\nstrangers to this Department.’ By way of postscript the French official\r\ndescribed how not long since a Dover boat, having captured two\r\nfishing-smacks of Boulogne and St. Valéry, made each boat pay\r\ntwenty-five guineas ransom, beat the men with swords, and wounded the\r\nSt. Valéry captain, remarking: ‘le procédé est d’autant plus inhumain\r\nqu’il a eu lieu de sang-froid et qu’il a été exercé contre des gens qui\r\nachetoient leur liberté au prix de toute leur fortune’.\r\n\r\nThis and other similar outrages on both sides led to the mutual\r\nagreement that fishing-boats were to be allowed to pursue their\r\navocation unmolested—an arrangement which in later times, when the\r\nbusiness of helping prisoners to escape was in full swing, proved to be\r\na mixed blessing.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the above-quoted argument of the French, that in\r\nreturn for sound men we were in the habit of sending the useless and\r\ninvalids, and that this largely compensated for the apparent\r\ndisproportion in the numbers exchanged—an argument which they used to\r\nthe end of the wars between the two nations—is to be too summarily\r\ndismissed as absurd. Nor does it seem that our treatment of the poor\r\nwretches erred on the side of indulgence, for many letters of complaint\r\nare extant, of which the following from a French cartel-ship captain of\r\n1780 is a specimen:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Combien n’est-il pas d’inhumanité d’envoyer des prisonniers les plus\r\nmalades, attaqués de fièvre et de dissentoire. J’espère, Monsieur, que\r\nvous, connoissant les sentiments les plus justes, que vous voudriez bien\r\ndonner vos ordres à M. Monckton, agent des prisonniers français, pour\r\nqu’il soit donné à mes malades des vivres frais, suivant l’ordinnance de\r\nvotre Majesté; ou, qu’ils soient mis à l’hôpital.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would seem that during the Seven Years’ War British merchant-ship and\r\nprivateer officers were only allowed to be on parole in France if they\r\ncould find a local person of standing to guarantee the payment of a sum\r\nof money to the Government in the case of a breach of parole.\r\n\r\nThe parole rules in France, so far as regarded the limits assigned to\r\nprisoners at their towns of confinement, were not nearly so strict as in\r\nEngland, but, on the other hand, no system of guarantee money like that\r\njust mentioned existed in England.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 1780, a table of exchange of prisoners of war, with the\r\nequivalent ransom rates, was agreed to, ranging from £60 or sixty men\r\nfor an admiral or field-marshal to £1 or one man for a common sailor or\r\nsoldier in the regular services, and from £4 or four men for a captain\r\nto £1 or one man of privateers and merchantmen.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 the French Government ordained a sweeping change by abolishing\r\nall equivalents in men or money to officers, and decreed that henceforth\r\nthe exchange should be strictly of grade for grade, and man for man, and\r\nthat no non-combatants or surgeons should be retained as prisoners of\r\nwar. How the two last provisions came to be habitually violated is\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nOn February 4, 1795, the Admiralty authorized the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office\r\nto send a representative to France, to settle, if possible, the vexed\r\nquestion of prisoner exchange, and on March 22 Mr. F. M. Eden started\r\nfor Brest, but was taken on to Roscoff. A week later a French naval\r\nofficer called on him and informed him that only the Committee of Public\r\nSafety could deal with this matter, and asked him to go to Paris. He\r\ndeclined; so the purport of his errand was sent to Paris. A reply\r\ninvited him to go to Dieppe. Here he met Comeyras, who said that the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety would not agree to his cartel, there being,\r\nthey said, a manifest difference between the two countries in that Great\r\nBritain carried on the war with the two professions—the navy and the\r\narmy—and that restoring prisoners to her would clearly be of greater\r\nadvantage to her than would be the returning of an equal number of men\r\nto France, who carried on war with the mass of the people. Moreover,\r\nGreat Britain notoriously wanted men to replace those she had lost,\r\nwhilst France had quite enough to enable her to defeat all her enemies.\r\n\r\nSo Eden returned to Brighthelmstone. Later, a meeting at the _Fountain_,\r\nCanterbury, between Otway and Marsh for Britain, and Monnerson for\r\nFrance, was equally fruitless, and it became quite evident that although\r\nFrance was glad enough to get general officers back, she had no\r\nparticular solicitude for the rank and file, her not illogical argument\r\nbeing that every fighting man, officer or private, was of more value to\r\nBritain than were three times their number of Frenchmen to France.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 many complaints were made by the British cartel-ship masters\r\nthat upon landing French prisoners at Morlaix their boats were taken\r\nfrom them, they were not allowed to go ashore, soldiers were placed on\r\nboard to watch them; that directly the prisoners were landed, the ships\r\nwere ordered to sea, irrespective of the weather; and that they were\r\nalways informed that there were no British prisoners to take back.\r\n\r\nIn this year we had much occasion to complain of the one-sided character\r\nof the system of prisoner exchange with France, the balance due to\r\nBritain in 1796 being no less than 5,000. Cartel after cartel went to\r\nFrance full and came back empty; in one instance only seventy-one\r\nBritish prisoners were returned for 201 French sent over; in another\r\ninstance 150 were sent and nine were returned, and in another 450 were\r\nsent without return.\r\n\r\nFrom the regularity with which our authorities seem to have been content\r\nto give without receiving, one cannot help wondering if, after all,\r\nthere might not have been some foundation for the frequent French retort\r\nthat while we received sound men, we only sent the diseased, and aged,\r\nor boys. Yet the correspondence from our side so regularly and\r\nemphatically repudiates this that we can only think that the burden of\r\nthe prisoners was galling the national back, and that the grumble was\r\nbecoming audible which later broke out in the articles of the\r\n_Statesman_, the _Examiner_, and the _Independent Whig_.\r\n\r\nFrom January 1, 1796, to March 14, 1798, the balance between Britain and\r\nHolland stood thus:\r\n\r\n               Dutch officers returned 316, men 416  732\r\n               British officers returned 64, men 290 354\r\n                                                     ———\r\n                         Balance due to us           378\r\n                                                     ———\r\n\r\nJust at this time there were a great many war-prisoners in England.\r\nNorman Cross and Yarmouth were full, and new prison ships were being\r\nfitted out at Chatham. The correspondence of the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office\r\nconsisted very largely of refusals to applicants to be allowed to go to\r\nFrance on parole, so that evidently the prisoner exchange was in so\r\nunsatisfactory a condition that even the passage of cartel loads of\r\ninvalids was suspended.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 an arrangement about the exchange of prisoners was come to\r\nbetween England and France. France was to send a vessel with British\r\nprisoners, 5 per cent of whom were to be officers, and England was to do\r\nthe same. The agents on each side were to select the prisoners. It was\r\nalso ruled that the prisoners in each country were to be supported by\r\ntheir own country, and that those who were sick, wounded, incapacitated,\r\nor boys, should be surrendered without equivalent.\r\n\r\nBut in 1799 the French Republican Government refused to clothe or\r\nsupport its prisoners in Britain, so that all exchanges of prisoners\r\nceased. Pending the interchange of correspondence which followed the\r\ndeclaration of this inhuman policy, the French prisoners suffered\r\nterribly, especially as it was winter, so that in January 1801, on\r\naccount of the fearful mortality among them, it was resolved that they\r\nshould be supplied with warm clothing at the public expense, and this\r\nwas done, the cost being very largely defrayed by voluntary\r\nsubscriptions in all parts of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first or second time that British benevolence had\r\nstepped in to stave off the results of French inhumanity towards\r\nFrenchmen.\r\n\r\nThe letter before quoted from the agent at Portchester (p. 18) and the\r\nreport on Stapleton (p. 19) in the chapter on International\r\nRecriminations have reference to this period.\r\n\r\nThis state of matters continued; the number of French prisoners in\r\nBritain increased enormously, for the French Government would return no\r\nanswers to the continued representations from this side as to the\r\nunsatisfactory character of the Exchange question. Yet in 1803 it was\r\nstated that although not one British prisoner of war, and only five\r\nBritish subjects, had been returned, no less than 400 French prisoners\r\nactually taken at sea had been sent to France.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Boyer, an officer at Belfast, wrote to his brother the general,\r\non parole at Montgomery, that the Emperor would not entertain any\r\nproposal for the exchange of prisoners unless the Hanoverian army were\r\nrecognized as prisoners of war. This was a sore topic with Bonaparte. In\r\n1803 the British Government had refused to ratify the condition of the\r\nTreaty of Sublingen which demanded that the Hanoverian army, helpless in\r\nthe face of Bonaparte’s sudden invasion of the country, should retire\r\nbehind the Elbe and engage not to serve against France or her Allies\r\nduring the war, in other words to agree to their being considered\r\nprisoners of war. Bonaparte insisted that as Britain was intimately\r\nlinked with Hanover through her king she should ratify this condition.\r\nOur Government repudiated all interest in Hanover’s own affairs: Hanover\r\nwas forced to yield, but Britain retaliated by blockading the Elbe and\r\nthe Weser, with the result that Hamburg and Bremen were half ruined.\r\n\r\nA form of exchange at sea was long practised of which the following is a\r\nspecimen:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We who have hereunto set our names, being a lieutenant and a master of\r\nH.B.M.’s ship _Virgin_, do hereby promise on our word of honour to cause\r\ntwo of His Christian Majesty’s subjects of the same class who may be\r\nPrisoners in England to be set at liberty by way of Exchange for us, we\r\nhaving been taken by the French and set at liberty on said terms, and in\r\ncase we don’t comply therewith we are obliged when called on to do so to\r\nreturn as Prisoners to France. Given under our hands in port of Coruña,\r\nJuly 31, 1762.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, this easy method of procuring liberty led to much\r\nparole breaking on both sides, but it was not until 1812 that such\r\ncontracts were declared to be illegal.\r\n\r\nDuring 1805 the British Government persisted in its efforts to bring\r\nabout an arrangement for the exchange of prisoners, but to these efforts\r\nthe extraordinary reply was:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Nothing can be done on the subject without a formal order from the\r\nEmperor, and under the present circumstances His Imperial Majesty cannot\r\nattend to this business.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Transport Board thus commented upon this:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Every proposal of this Government relative to the exchanging of\r\nprisoners has been met by that of France with insulting evasion or\r\ncontemptuous silence. As such [_sic_] it would be derogatory to the\r\nhonour of the Kingdom to strive further in the cause of Humanity when\r\nour motives would be misnamed, and the objects unattained.\r\n\r\n‘This Board will not take any further steps in the subject, but will\r\nrejoice to meet France in any proposal from thence.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Transport Office posted as a circular the\r\nDeclaration of the French Government not to exchange even aged and\r\ninfirm British prisoners in France.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 the Transport Office replied as follows to the request for\r\nliberation of a French officer on parole at Tiverton, who cited the\r\nrelease of Mr. Cockburn from France in support of his petition:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Cockburn never was a prisoner of war, but was detained in France at\r\nthe commencement of hostilities contrary to the practise of civilized\r\nnations, and so far from the French Government having released, as you\r\nsay, many British prisoners, so that they might re-establish their\r\nhealth in their own country, only three persons coming under the\r\ndescription have been liberated in return for 672 French officers and\r\n1,062 men who have been sent to France on account of being ill. Even the\r\nfavour granted to the above mentioned three persons was by the interest\r\nof private individuals, and cannot be considered as an act of the\r\nGovernment of that country.’\r\n\r\n\r\n(A similar reply was given to many other applicants.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDenmark, like Holland, made no replies to the British Government’s\r\nrequest for an arrangement of the exchange of prisoners, and of course,\r\nboth took their cue from France. In the year 1808 the balance due from\r\nDenmark to Britain was 3,807. There were 1,796 Danish prisoners in\r\nEngland. Between 1808 and 1813 the balance due to us was 2,697. As\r\nanother result of the French policy, the Transport Office requested the\r\nDuke of Wellington in Spain to arrange for the exchange of prisoners on\r\nthe spot, as, under present circumstances, once a man became a prisoner\r\nin France, his services were probably lost to his country for ever. Yet\r\nanother result was that the prisoners in confinement all over Britain in\r\n1810, finding that the exchange system was practically suspended, became\r\nturbulent and disorderly to such an extent, and made such desperate\r\nattempts to break out, notably at Portchester and Dartmoor, that it was\r\nfound necessary to double the number of sentries.\r\n\r\nAt length in 1810, soon after the marriage of Bonaparte with Marie\r\nLouise, an attempt was made at Morlaix to arrange matters, and the Comte\r\ndu Moustier met Mr. Mackenzie there. Nothing came of it, because of the\r\nexorbitant demands of Bonaparte. He insisted that all prisoners—English,\r\nFrench, Spanish, Portuguese, Italians—should be exchanged, man for man,\r\nrank for rank, on the same footing as the principal power under whom\r\nthey fought; in other words, that for 50,000 Frenchmen, only 10,000\r\nBritish would be returned, the balance being made up of Spanish and\r\nPortuguese more or less raw levies, who were not to be compared in\r\nfighting value with Englishmen or Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the fourth article of Mr. Mackenzie’s note was:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘All the French prisoners, of whatever rank and quality, at present\r\ndetained in Great Britain, or in the British possessions, shall be\r\nreleased. The exchange shall commence immediately after the signature of\r\nthis convention, and shall be made by sending successively to Morlaix,\r\nor to any other port in the British Channel that may be agreed on, or by\r\ndelivering to the French Commissioners, a thousand French prisoners for\r\na thousand English prisoners, as promptly and in the same proportion as\r\nthe Government shall release the latter.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAs neither party would yield, the negotiations were broken off. The\r\n_Moniteur_ complained that some one of higher rank than Mr. Mackenzie\r\nhad not been sent as British representative, and the British paper _The\r\nStatesman_ commented strongly upon our non-acceptance of Bonaparte’s\r\nterms, although endorsing our refusal to accede to the particular\r\narticle about the proportion of the exchange.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pillet, before quoted, criticizes the British action in his\r\nusual vitriolic fashion. After alluding bitterly to the conduct of the\r\nBritish Government in the matters of San Domingo and the Hanoverian\r\narmy—both of which are still regarded by French writers as eminent\r\ninstances of British bad faith, he describes the Morlaix meeting as an\r\n‘infamous trap’ on the part of our Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We had the greater interest in this negotiation,’ he says; we desired\r\nexchange with a passion difficult to describe. Well! we trembled lest\r\nFrance should accept conditions which would have returned to their homes\r\nall the English prisoners without our receiving back a single Frenchman\r\nwho was not sick or dying ... it was clearly demonstrated that the one\r\naim of the London Cabinet was to destroy us all, and from this moment it\r\nset to work to capture as many prisoners as possible, so that it might\r\nalmost be said that this was the one object of the War!’\r\n\r\n\r\nLas Cases quotes Bonaparte’s comments in this matter:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The English had infinitely more French than I had English prisoners. I\r\nknew well that the moment they had got back their own they would have\r\ndiscovered some pretext for carrying the exchange no further, and my\r\npoor French would have remained for ever in the hulks. I admitted,\r\ntherefore, that I had much fewer English than they had French prisoners:\r\nbut then I had a great number of Spanish and Portuguese, and by taking\r\nthem into account, I had a mass of prisoners considerably greater than\r\ntheirs. I offered, therefore, to exchange the whole. This proposition at\r\nfirst disconcerted them, _but at length they agreed to it_. But I had my\r\neye on everything. I saw clearly that if they began by exchanging an\r\nEnglishman against a Frenchman, as soon as they got back their own they\r\nwould have brought forward something to stop the exchanges. I insisted\r\ntherefore that 3,000 Frenchmen should be exchanged against 1,000 English\r\nand 2,000 Spaniards and Portuguese. They refused this, and so the\r\nnegotiations broke off.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWant of space prevents me from quoting the long conversation which was\r\nheld upon the subject of the Exchange of Prisoners of War between\r\nBonaparte and Las Cases at St. Helena, although it is well worth the\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nAs the object of this work is confined to prisoners of war in Britain,\r\nit is manifestly beyond its province to discuss at length the vexed\r\nquestions of the comparative treatment of prisoners in the two\r\ncountries. I may reiterate that on the whole the balance is fairly even,\r\nand that much depended upon local surroundings. Much evidence could be\r\ncited to show that in certain French seaports and in certain inland\r\ntowns set apart for the residence of Bonaparte’s _détenus_ quite as much\r\nbrutality was exercised upon British subjects as was exercised upon\r\nFrench prisoners in England. Much depended upon the character of the\r\nlocal commandant; much depended upon the behaviour of the prisoners;\r\nmuch depended upon local sentiment. Bitche, for instance, became known\r\nas ‘the place of tears’ from the misery of the captives there; Verdun,\r\non the other hand, after the tyrannical commandant Virion had made away\r\nwith himself, was to all appearances a gay, happy, fashionable\r\nwatering-place. Bitche had a severe commandant, and the class of\r\nprisoner there was generally rough and low. Beauchêne was a genial\r\njailer at Verdun, and the mass of the prisoners were well-to-do. So in\r\nBritain. Woodriff was disliked at Norman Cross, and all was unhappiness.\r\nDraper was beloved, and Norman Cross became quite a place of captivity\r\nto be sought after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                      THE PRISON SYSTEM—THE HULKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foreign prisoner of war in Britain, if an ordinary sailor or\r\nsoldier, was confined either on board a prison ship or in prison ashore.\r\nOfficers of certain exactly defined ranks were allowed to be upon parole\r\nif they chose, in specified towns. Some officers refused to be bound by\r\nthe parole requirements, and preferred the hulk or the prison with the\r\nchance of being able to escape.\r\n\r\nEach of these—the Hulks, the Prisons, Parole—will be dealt with\r\nseparately, as each has its particular characteristics and interesting\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThe prison ship as a British institution for the storage and maintenance\r\nof men whose sole crime was that of fighting against us, must for ever\r\nbe a reproach to us. There is nothing to be urged in its favour. It was\r\nnot a necessity; it was far from being a convenience; it was not\r\neconomical; it was not sanitary. Man took one of the most beautiful\r\nobjects of his handiwork and deformed it into a hideous monstrosity. The\r\nline-of-battle ship was a thing of beauty, but when masts and rigging\r\nand sails were shorn away, when the symmetrical sweep of her lines was\r\ndeformed by all sorts of excrescences and superstructures, when her\r\nwhite, black-dotted belts were smudged out, it lay, rather than floated,\r\nlike a gigantic black, shapeless coffin. Sunshine, which can give a\r\ntouch of picturesqueness, if not of beauty, to so much that is bare and\r\nfeatureless, only brought out into greater prominence the dirt, the\r\nshabbiness, the patchiness of the thing. In fog it was weird. In\r\nmoonlight it was spectral. The very prison and cemetery architects of\r\nto-day strive to lead the eye by their art away from what the mind\r\npictures, but when the British Government brought the prison ship on to\r\nthe scene they appear to have aimed as much as possible at making the\r\noutside reflect the life within.\r\n\r\nNo amount of investigation, not the most careful sifting of evidence,\r\ncan blind our eyes to the fact that the British prison hulks were hells\r\nupon water. It is not that the mortality upon them was abnormal: it was\r\ngreater than in the shore prisons, but it never exceeded 3 per cent upon\r\nan average, although there were periods of epidemic when it rose much\r\nhigher. It is that the lives of those condemned to them were lives of\r\nlong, unbroken suffering. The writer, as an Englishman, would gladly\r\nrecord otherwise, but he is bound to tell the truth, the whole truth,\r\nand nothing but the truth. True it is that our evidence is almost\r\nentirely that of prisoners themselves, but what is not, is that of\r\nEnglish officers, and theirs is of condemnation. It should be borne in\r\nmind that the experiences we shall quote are those of officers and\r\ngentlemen, or at any rate educated men, and the agreement is so\r\nremarkable that it would be opening the way to an accusation of national\r\npartiality if we were to refuse to accept it.\r\n\r\nThe only palliating consideration in this sad confession is that the\r\nprisoners brought upon themselves much of the misery. The passion for\r\ngambling, fomented by long, weary hours of enforced idleness, wrought\r\nfar more mischief among the foreign prisoners in England, than did the\r\ncorresponding northern passion for drink among the British prisoners\r\nabroad, if only from the fact that whereas the former, ashore and\r\nafloat, could gamble when and where they chose, drink was not readily\r\nprocurable by the latter. The report of a French official doctor upon\r\nprison-ship diseases will be quoted in its proper place, but the two\r\nchief causes of disease named by him—insufficient food and insufficient\r\nclothing—were very largely the result of the passion for gambling among\r\nthe prisoners.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of _The Times_, December 16, 1807, writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘There is such a spirit of gambling existing among the French prisoners\r\nlately arrived at Chatham from Norman Cross, that many of them have been\r\nalmost entirely naked during the late severe weather, having lost their\r\nclothes, not even excepting their shirts and small clothes, to some of\r\ntheir fellow prisoners: many of them also are reduced to the chance of\r\nstarving by the same means, having lost seven or eight days’ provisions\r\nto their more fortunate companions, who never fail to exact their\r\nwinnings. The effervescence of mind that this diabolical pursuit gives\r\nrise to is often exemplified in the conduct of these infatuated\r\ncaptives, rendering them remarkably turbulent and unruly. Saturday last,\r\na quarrel arose between two of them in the course of play, when one of\r\nthem, who had lost his clothes and food, received a stab in the back.’\r\n\r\n‘Gambling among the French prisoners on the several prison-ships in the\r\nMedway has arrived at an alarming height. On board the _Buckingham_,\r\nwhere there are nearly 600 prisoners, are a billiard table, hazard\r\ntables, &c.; and the prisoners indulge themselves in play during the\r\nhours they are allowed for exercise.’\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the chief cause of suffering, medical neglect, there is, unhappily,\r\nbut little defence, for, if the complaints of neglect, inefficacy, and\r\nof actual cruelty, which did manage to reach the august sanctum of the\r\nTransport Office were numerous, how many more must there have been which\r\nwere adroitly prevented from getting there.\r\n\r\nAgain, a great deal depended upon the prison-ship commander. French\r\nwriters are accustomed to say that the lieutenants in charge of the\r\nBritish prison ships were the scum of the service—disappointed men, men\r\nwithout interest, men under official clouds which checked their advance;\r\nand it must be admitted that at first sight it seems strange that in a\r\ntime of war all over the world, when promotion must have been rapid, and\r\nthe chances of distinction frequent, officers should easily be found\r\nready, for the remuneration of seven shillings per diem, plus\r\neighteenpence servant allowance, to take up such a position as the\r\ncharge of seven or eight hundred desperate foreigners.\r\n\r\nBut that this particular service was attractive is evident from the\r\nconstant applications for it from naval men with good credentials, and\r\nfrom the frequent reply of the authorities that the waiting list was\r\nfull. If we may judge this branch of the service by others, and reading\r\nthe matter by the light of the times, we can only infer that the\r\nCommander of a prison hulk was in the way of getting a good many\r\n‘pickings’, and that as, according to regulation, no lieutenant of less\r\nthan ten years’ service in that rank could apply for appointment, the\r\nberth was regarded as a sort of reward or solatium.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may have been, the condition of a prison ship, like the\r\ncondition of a man-of-war to-day, depended very largely upon the\r\ncharacter of her commander. It is curious to note that most of the few\r\ntestimonies extant from prisoners in favour of prison-ship captains date\r\nfrom that period of the great wars when the ill-feeling between the two\r\ncountries was most rancorous, and the poor fellows on parole in English\r\ninland towns were having a very rough time.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 the Commandant at Portsmouth was Captain Miller, a good and\r\nhumane man who took very much to heart the sufferings of the war\r\nprisoners under his supervision. He happened to meet among the French\r\nnaval officers on parole a M. Haguelin of Havre, who spoke English\r\nperfectly, and with whom he often conversed on the subject of the hard\r\nlot of the prisoners on the hulks. He offered Haguelin a place in his\r\noffice, which the poor officer gladly accepted, made him his chief\r\ninterpreter, and then employed him to visit the prison ships twice a\r\nweek to hear and note complaints with the view of remedying them.\r\n\r\nHaguelin held this position for some years. In 1808 an English frigate\r\ncaptured twenty-four Honfleur fishing-boats and brought them and their\r\ncrews into Portsmouth. Miller regarded this act as a gross violation of\r\nthe laws of humanity, and determined to undo it. Haguelin was employed\r\nin the correspondence which followed between Captain Miller and the\r\nTransport Office, the result being that the fishermen were well treated,\r\nand finally sent back to Honfleur in an English frigate. Then ensued the\r\nepisode of the _Flotte en jupons_, described in a pamphlet by one\r\nThomas, when the women of Honfleur came out, boarded the English\r\nfrigate, and amidst a memorable scene of enthusiasm brought their\r\nhusbands and brothers and lovers safe to land. When Haguelin was\r\nexchanged and was leaving for France, Miller wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I cannot sufficiently express how much I owe to M. Haguelin for his\r\nceaseless and powerful co-operation on the numerous occasions when he\r\nlaboured to better the condition of his unfortunate compatriots. The\r\nconscientiousness which characterized all his acts makes him deserve\r\nwell of his country.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1816, Captain (afterwards Baron) Charles Dupin, of the French Corps\r\nof Naval Engineers, placed on record a very scathing report upon the\r\ntreatment of his countrymen upon the hulks at Chatham. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Medway is covered with men-of-war, dismantled and lying in\r\nordinary. Their fresh and brilliant painting contrasts with the hideous\r\naspect of the old and smoky hulks, which seem the remains of vessels\r\nblackened by a recent fire. It is in these floating tombs that are\r\nburied alive prisoners of war—Danes, Swedes, Frenchmen, Americans, no\r\nmatter. They are lodged on the lower deck, on the upper deck, and even\r\non the orlop-deck.... Four hundred malefactors are the maximum of a ship\r\nappropriated to convicts. From eight hundred to twelve hundred is the\r\nordinary number of prisoners of war, heaped together in a prison-ship of\r\nthe same rate.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe translator of Captain Dupin’s report[2] comments thus upon this part\r\nof it:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The long duration of hostilities, combined with our resplendent naval\r\nvictories, and our almost constant success by land as well as by sea,\r\nincreased the number of prisoners so much as to render the confinement\r\nof a great proportion of them in prison-ships a matter of necessity\r\nrather than of choice; there being, in 1814, upwards of 70,000 French\r\nprisoners of war in this country.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Dupin’s severe remarks concerning the bad treatment of the\r\nprisoners, their scanty subsistence, their neglect during sickness and\r\nthe consequent high rate of mortality among them, the translator says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The prisoners were well treated in every respect; their provisions were\r\ngood in quality, and their clothing sufficient; but, owing to their\r\nunconquerable propensity to gambling, many of them frequently deprived\r\nthemselves of their due allowance both of food and raiment. As to fresh\r\nair, wind-sails were always pointed below in the prison ships to promote\r\nits circulation. For the hulks themselves the roomiest and airiest of\r\ntwo and three deckers were selected, and were cleared of all\r\nencumbrances.\r\n\r\n‘Post-captains of experience were selected to be in command at each\r\nport, and a steady lieutenant placed over each hulk. The prisoners were\r\nmustered twice a week; persons, bedding, and clothing were all kept\r\nclean; the decks were daily scraped and rubbed with sand: they were\r\nseldom washed in summer, and never in winter, to avoid damp. Every\r\nmorning the lee ports were opened so that the prisoners should not be\r\ntoo suddenly exposed to the air, and no wet clothes were allowed to be\r\nhung before the ports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRENCH SAILORS ON AN ENGLISH PRISON SHIP.\r\n\r\n  (_After Bombled._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n‘The provisions were minutely examined every morning by the lieutenant,\r\nand one prisoner from each mess was chosen to attend to the delivery of\r\nprovisions, and to see that they were of the right quality and weight.\r\nThe allowance of food was:\r\n\r\n‘Each man on each of five days per week received one and a half pounds\r\nof wheaten flour bread, half a pound of good fresh beef with cabbage or\r\nonions, turnips and salt, and on each of the other two days one pound of\r\ngood salted cod or herrings, and potatoes. The average number of\r\nprisoners on a seventy-four was from six to seven hundred, and this, it\r\nshould be remembered, on a ship cleared from all encumbrances such as\r\nguns, partitions, and enclosures.’\r\n\r\n\r\nDupin wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘By a restriction which well describes the mercantile jealousy of a\r\nmanufacturing people, the prisoners were prohibited from making for sale\r\nwoollen gloves and straw hats. It would have injured in these petty\r\nbranches the commerce of His Britannic Majesty’s subjects!’\r\n\r\n\r\nto which the reply was:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It was so. These “petty branches” of manufactures were the employment\r\nof the wives and children of the neighbouring cottagers, and enabled\r\nthem to pay their rent and taxes: and, on a representation by the\r\nmagistrates that the vast quantities sent into the market by the French\r\nprisoners who had neither rent, nor taxes, nor lodging, firing, food or\r\nclothes to find, had thrown the industrious cottagers out of work, an\r\norder was sent to stop this manufacture by the prisoners.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the sickness on board the hulks, in reply to Dupin’s assertions\r\nthe Government had the following table drawn up relative to the hulks at\r\nPortsmouth in a month of 1813:\r\n\r\n               _Ship’s Name._ _Prisoners     _Sick._\r\n                                  in\r\n                               Health._\r\n\r\n               Prothée               583      10 }\r\n               Crown                 608       3 }\r\n               San Damaso            726      32 }\r\n               Vigilant              590       8 }\r\n               Guildford             693       8 }\r\n               San Antonio           820       9 }\r\n               Vengeance             692       7 }\r\n               Veteran               592       7 } = 1½%\r\n               Suffolk               683       6 }\r\n               Assistance            727      35 }\r\n               Ave Princessa         769       9 }\r\n               Kron Princessa        760       4 }\r\n               Waldemar              809       1 }\r\n               Negro                 175       0 }\r\n                                   —————     ———\r\n                                   9,227     139\r\n                                   =====     ===\r\n\r\nDupin also published tables of prison mortality in England in\r\nconfirmation of the belief among his countrymen that it was part of\r\nEngland’s diabolic policy to make prisoners of war or to kill or\r\nincapacitate them by neglect or ill-treatment. Between 1803 and 1814,\r\nthe total number of prisoners brought to England was 122,440. Of these,\r\nsays M.

At Portsmouth in 1812 the\r\nmortality on the hulks was about 4 per cent. At Dartmoor in six years\r\nand seven months there were 1,455 deaths, which, taking the average\r\nnumber of prisoners at 5,000, works out at a little over 4 per cent\r\nannually. But during six months of the years 1809–1810 there were 500\r\ndeaths out of 5,000 prisoners at Dartmoor, due to an unusual epidemic\r\nand to exceptionally severe weather. With the extraordinary healthiness\r\nof the Perth dépôt I shall deal in its proper place.\r\n\r\nI have to thank Mr. Neves, editor of the _Chatham News_, for the\r\nfollowing particulars relative to Chatham.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The exact number of prisoners accommodated in these floating prisons\r\ncannot be ascertained, but it appears they were moored near the old\r\nGillingham Fort (long since demolished) which occupied a site in the\r\nmiddle of what is now Chatham Dockyard Extension. St. Mary’s Barracks,\r\nGillingham, were built during the Peninsular War for the accommodation\r\nof French prisoners. There is no doubt that the rate of mortality among\r\nthe prisoners confined in the hulks was very high, and the bodies were\r\nburied on St. Mary’s Island on ground which is now the Dockyard Wharf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PRISON SHIPS.\r\n\r\n  (_From a sketch by the author._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n‘In the course of the excavations in connexion with the extension of the\r\nDockyard—a work of great magnitude which was commenced in 1864 and not\r\nfinished until 1884, and which cost £3,000,000, the remains of many of\r\nthe French prisoners were disinterred. The bones were collected and\r\nbrought round to a site within the extension works, opposite Cookham\r\nWoods. A small cemetery of about 200 feet square was formed, railed in,\r\nand laid out in flower-beds and gravelled pathways. A handsome monument,\r\ndesigned by the late Sir Andrew Clarke, was erected in the centre—the\r\nplinth and steps of granite, with a finely carved figure in armour and\r\ncloaked, and holding an inverted torch in the centre, under a canopied\r\nand groined spire terminating in crockets and gilt finials. In addition\r\nto erecting this monument the Admiralty allotted a small sum annually\r\nfor keeping it in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The memorial bore the following inscription, which was written by the\r\nlate Sir Stafford Northcote, afterwards Lord Iddesleigh:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Here are gathered together\r\n\r\nThe remains of many brave soldiers and sailors, who, having been once\r\nthe foes, and afterwards captives, of England, now find rest in her\r\nsoil, remembering no more the animosities of war or the sorrows of\r\nimprisonment. They were deprived of the consolation of closing their\r\neyes among the countrymen they loved; but they have been laid in an\r\nhonoured grave by a nation which knows how to respect valour and to\r\nsympathize with misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Government of the French Republic was deeply moved by the action of\r\nthe Admiralty, and its Ambassador in London wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government of the Republic has been made acquainted through me with\r\nthe recent decision taken by the Government of the Queen to assure the\r\npreservation of the funeral monument at Chatham, where rest the remains\r\nof the soldiers and sailors of the First Empire who died prisoners of\r\nwar on board the English hulks. I am charged to make known to your\r\nlordship that the Minister of Marine has been particularly affected at\r\nthe initiative taken in this matter by the British Administration. I\r\nshall be much obliged to you if you will make known to H.M’s Government\r\nthe sincere feelings of gratitude of the Government of the Republic for\r\nthe homage rendered to our deceased soldiers.\r\n\r\n                                                    (Signed) WADDINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In 1904 it became necessary again to move the bones of the prisoners of\r\nwar and they were then interred in the grounds of the new naval\r\nbarracks, a site being set apart for the purpose near the chapel, where\r\nthe monument was re-erected. It occupies a position where it can be seen\r\nby passers-by. The number of skulls was 506. Quite recently (1910) two\r\nskeletons were dug up by excavators of the Gas Company’s new wharf at\r\nGillingham, and, there being every reason to believe that they were the\r\nremains of French prisoners of war, they were returned to the little\r\ncemetery above mentioned.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MEMORIAL TO FRENCH PRISONERS OF WAR IN THE ROYAL NAVAL BARRACKS,\r\n    CHATHAM\r\n]\r\n\r\nThat a vast system of jobbery and corruption prevailed among the\r\ncontractors for the food, clothing, and bedding of the prisoners, and,\r\nconsequently, among those in office who had the power of selection and\r\nappointment; and more, that not a tithe of what existed was expressed,\r\nis not the least among the many indictments against our nation at this\r\nperiod which bring a flush of shame to the cheek. As has been before\r\nremarked, all that printed regulations and ordinance could do to keep\r\nmatters in proper order was done. What could read better, for instance,\r\nthan the following official Contracting Obligations for 1797:\r\n\r\n ‘Beer:   to be equal in quality to that issued on H.M.’s ships.\r\n\r\n Beef:    to be good and wholesome fresh beef, and delivered in clean\r\n            quarters.\r\n\r\n Cheese:  to be good Gloucester or Wiltshire, or equal in quality.\r\n\r\n Pease:   to be of the white sort and good boilers.\r\n\r\n Greens:  to be stripped of outside leaves and fit for the copper.\r\n\r\n Beer:    every 7 barrels to be brewed from 8 bushels of the strongest\r\n            amber malt, and 6 or 7 lb. of good hops at £1 18s. per ton.\r\n\r\n Bread:   to be equal in quality to that served on H.M.’s ships.’\r\n\r\nAs if there was really some wish on the part of the authorities to have\r\nthings in order, the custom began in 1804 for the Transport Board to\r\nsend to its prison agents and prison-ship commanders this notice:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I am directed by the Board to desire that you will immediately forward\r\nto this office by coach a loaf taken indiscriminately from the bread\r\nissued to the prisoners on the day you receive this letter.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn so many cases was the specimen bread sent pronounced ‘not fit to be\r\neaten’, that circulars were sent that all prisons and ships would\r\nreceive a model loaf of the bread to be served out to prisoners, ‘made\r\nof whole wheaten meal actually and bona fide dressed through an eleven\r\nshilling cloth’.\r\n\r\nNor was the regulation quantity less satisfactory than the nominal\r\nquality. In 1812 the scale of victualling on prison ships according to\r\nthe advertisement to contractors was:\r\n\r\n Sunday.     1½ lb. bread.\r\n\r\n Monday.      ½ lb. fresh beef.\r\n\r\n Tuesday.     ½ lb. cabbage or turnip.\r\n\r\n Thursday.   1 ounce Scotch barley.\r\n\r\n Saturday.    ⅓ ounce salt.\r\n\r\n              ¼ ounce onions.\r\n\r\n Wednesday.  1½ lb. bread, 1 lb. good sound herrings, 1 lb. good sound\r\n               potatoes.\r\n\r\n Friday.     1½ lb. bread, 1 lb. good sound cod, 1 lb. potatoes.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1778 there were 924 American prisoners of war in England. It\r\nhas been shown before (p. 11) how the fact of their ill-treatment was\r\nforcibly taken up by their own Government, but the following extract\r\nfrom a London newspaper further shows that the real cause of their\r\nill-treatment was no secret:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘As to the prisoners who were kept in England’ (this is the sequel of\r\nremarks about our harsh treatment of American prisoners in America),\r\n‘their penury and distress was undoubtedly great, and was much marked\r\n_by the fraud and cruelty of those who were entrusted with their\r\ngovernment, and the supply of their provisions_. For these persons, who\r\ncertainly never had any orders for ill-treatment of the prisoners by\r\ncountenance in it, having, however, not been overlooked with the utmost\r\nvigilance, besides their prejudice and their natural cruelty,\r\n_considered their offices as only lucrative jobs which were created\r\nmerely for their emolument_. Whether there was not some exaggeration, as\r\nthere usually is in these accounts, it is certain that though the\r\nsubsistence accorded them by Government would indeed have been\r\nsufficient, if honestly administered, to have sustained human nature, in\r\nthe respect to the mere articles of foods, yet the want of clothes,\r\nfiring, and bedding, with all the other various articles which custom or\r\nnature regards as conducive to health and comfort, became practically\r\ninsupportable in the extremity of the winter. In consequence of the\r\ncomplaint by the prisoners, the matter was very humanely taken up in the\r\nHouse of Peers by Lord Abingdon ... and soon after a liberal\r\nsubscription was carried on in London and other parts, and this provided\r\na sufficient remedy for the evil.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 13, 1778, a Contractors’ Bill was brought in to Parliament by\r\nSir Philip Jenning Clarke ‘for the restraining of any person being a\r\nMember of the House of Commons, from being concerned himself or any\r\nperson in trust for him, in any contract made by the Commissioners of\r\nH.M.’s Navy or Treasury, the Board of Ordnance, or by any other person\r\nor persons for the public service, unless the said contract shall be\r\nmade at a public bidding’.\r\n\r\nThe first reading of the Bill was carried by seventy-one to fifty, the\r\nsecond reading by seventy-two to sixty-one. Success in the Lords was\r\ntherefore regarded as certain. Yet it was actually lost by two votes\r\nupon the question of commitment, and the exertion of Government\r\ninfluence in the Bill was taken to mean a censure on certain Treasury\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nSo things went on in the old way. Between 1804 and 1808 the evil state\r\nof matters was either so flagrant that it commanded attention, or some\r\nfearless official new broom was doing his duty, for the records of these\r\nyears abound with complaints, exposures, trials, and judgements.\r\n\r\nWe read of arrangements being discussed between contractors and the\r\nstewards of prison ships by which part of the statutory provisions was\r\nwithheld from the prisoners; of hundreds of suits of clothing sent of\r\none size, of boots supposed to last eighteen months which fell to pieces\r\nduring the first wet weather; of rotten hammocks, of blankets so thin\r\nthat they were transparent; of hundreds of sets of handcuffs being\r\nreturned as useless; of contractors using salt water in the manufacture\r\nof bread instead of salt, and further, of these last offenders being\r\nprosecuted, not for making unwholesome bread, but for defrauding the\r\nRevenue! Out of 1,200 suits of clothes ordered to be at Plymouth by\r\nOctober 1807, as provision for the winter, by March 1808 only 300 had\r\nbeen delivered!\r\n\r\nLet us take this last instance and consider what it meant.\r\n\r\nIt meant, firstly, that the contractor had never the smallest intention\r\nof delivering the full number of suits. Secondly, that he had, by means\r\nbest known to himself and the officials, received payment for the whole.\r\nThirdly, that hundreds of poor wretches had been compelled to face the\r\nrigour of an English winter on the hulks in a half naked condition, to\r\nrelieve which very many of them had been driven to gambling and even\r\nworse crimes.\r\n\r\nAnd all the time the correspondence of the Transport Office consists to\r\na large extent of rules and regulations and provisions and safeguards\r\nagainst fraud and wrong-doing; moral precepts accompany inquiry about a\r\nmissing guard-room poker, and sentimental exhortations wind up\r\nparagraphs about the letting of grazing land or the acquisition of new\r\nchimney-pots. Agents and officials are constantly being reminded and\r\nadvised and lectured and reproved. Money matters of the most trifling\r\nsignificance are carefully and minutely dealt with. Yet we know that the\r\nwar-prison contract business was a festering mass of jobbery and\r\ncorruption, that large fortunes were made by contractors, that a whole\r\narmy of small officials and not a few big ones throve on the ‘pickings’\r\nto be had.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a fraudulent contractor was brought up, heavily fined and\r\nimprisoned; but such cases are so rare that it is hard to avoid the\r\nsuspicion that their prominence was a matter of expediency and policy,\r\nand that many a rascal who should have been hanged for robbing\r\ndefenceless foreigners of the commonest rights of man had means with\r\nwhich to defeat justice and to persist unchecked in his unholy calling.\r\nReferences to this evil will be made in the chapter dealing with prisons\r\nashore, in connexion with which the misdeeds of contractors seem to have\r\nbeen more frequent and more serious than with the hulks.\r\n\r\nIf it is painful for an Englishman to be obliged to write thus upon the\r\nsubject of fraudulent contractors, their aiders and abettors, still more\r\nso is it to have to confess that a profession even more closely\r\nassociated with the cause of humanity seems to have been far too often\r\nunworthily represented.\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the unanimity of foreign officer-prisoners\r\nabout the utter misery of prison-ship life, but in nothing is their\r\nagreement more marked than their condemnation, not merely of our methods\r\nof treatment of the sick and wounded, but of the character of the\r\nprison-ship doctors. Always bearing in mind that Britain treated her own\r\nsailors and soldiers as if they were vicious animals, and that the\r\nsickbay and the cockpit of a man-of-war of Nelson’s day were probably\r\nnot very much better than those described by Smollett in _Roderick\r\nRandom_, which was written in 1748, there seems to have been an amount\r\nof gratuitous callousness and cruelty practised by the medical officers\r\nattached to the hulks which we cannot believe would have been permitted\r\nupon the national ships.\r\n\r\nAnd here again the Government Regulations were admirable on paper: the\r\none point which was most strongly insisted upon being that the doctors\r\nshould live on board the vessels, and devote the whole of their time to\r\ntheir duties, whereas there is abundant evidence to show that most of\r\nthe doctors of the Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Chatham hulks carried on\r\nprivate practices ashore and in consequence lived ashore.\r\n\r\nMore will be found upon this unhappy topic in the next chapter of\r\nrecords of life on the hulks, but we may fittingly close the present\r\nwith the report upon hulk diseases by Dr. Fontana, French Officer of\r\nHealth to the Army of Portugal, written upon the _Brunswick_ prison ship\r\nat Chatham in 1812, and published as an appendix to Colonel Lebertre’s\r\nbook upon English war-prison life.\r\n\r\nHe divides the diseases into three heads:\r\n\r\n(1) _External_, arising from utter want of exercise, from damp, from\r\ninsufficient food—especially upon the ‘maigre’ days of the week—and from\r\nlack of clothing. Wounds on the legs, which were generally bare, made\r\nbad ulcers which the ‘bourreaux’ of English doctors treated with quack\r\nremedies such as the unguent basilicon. He describes the doctor of the\r\n_Fyen_ prison hospital-ship as a type of the English ignorant and brutal\r\nmedical man.\r\n\r\n(2) _Scorbutic diathesis_, arising from the ulcers and tumours on the\r\nlower limbs, caused by the breathing of foul air from twelve to sixteen\r\nhours a day, by overcrowding, salt food, lack of vegetables, and\r\ndeprivation of all alcohol.\r\n\r\n(3) _Chest troubles_—naturally the most prevalent, largely owing to\r\nmoral despair caused by humiliations and cruelties, and deprivations\r\ninflicted by low-born, uneducated brutes, miserable accommodation, the\r\nfoul exhalations from the mud shores at low water, and the cruel\r\ntreatment by doctors, who practised severe bleedings, prescribed no\r\ndieting except an occasional mixture, the result being extreme weakness.\r\nWhen the patient was far gone in disease he was sent to hospital, where\r\nmore bleeding was performed, a most injudicious use of mercury made, and\r\nhis end hastened.\r\n\r\nThe great expense of the hulks, together with the comparative ease with\r\nwhich escape could be made from them, and the annually increasing number\r\nof prisoners brought to England, led to the development of the Land\r\nPrison System. It was shown that the annual expense of a seventy-four,\r\nfitted to hold 700 prisoners, was £5,869. Dartmoor Prison, built to hold\r\n6,000 prisoners, cost £135,000, and the annual expense of it was £2,862:\r\nin other words, it would require eight seventy-fours at an annual\r\nexpense of £46,952 to accommodate this number of prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe hulks were retained until the end of the great wars, and that they\r\nwere recognized by the authorities as particular objects of aversion and\r\ndread seems to be evident from the fact that incorrigible offenders from\r\nthe land prisons were sent there, as in the case of the wholesale\r\ntransfer to them in 1812 of the terrible ‘Romans’ from Dartmoor, and\r\nfrom the many letters written by prisoners on board the hulks praying to\r\nbe sent to prison on land, of which the following, from a French officer\r\non a Gillingham hulk to Lady Pigott, is a specimen:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       H.M.S. _Sampson_.\r\n\r\n ‘MY LADY:\r\n\r\n‘Je crains d’abuser de votre bonté naturelle et de ce doux sentiment de\r\ncompation qui vous fait toujours prendre pitié des malheureux, mais,\r\nMadame, un infortuné sans amis et sans soutiens se réfugie sous les\r\nauspices des personnes généreuses qui daignent le plaindre, et vous avez\r\nhumainement pris part à mes maux. Souffrez donc que je vous supplie\r\nencore de renouveler vos demandes en ma faveur, si toutefois cette\r\ndemande ne doit pas être contraire à votre tranquillité personnelle.\r\nVoilà deux ans que je suis renfermé dans cette prison si nuisible à ma\r\nsanté plus chancellante et plus débile que jamais. Voilà six ans et plus\r\nque je suis prisonnier sans espoir qu’un sort si funeste et si peu\r\nmérité finisse. Si je n’ai pas mérité la mort, et si on ne veut pas me\r\nla donner, il faut qu’on me permette de retourner m’isoler à terre, où\r\nje pourrais alors dans la tranquillité vivre d’une manière plus\r\nconvenable à ma faible constitution, et résister au malheur, pour vous\r\nprouver, my lady, que quand j’ai commis la faute pour laquelle je\r\nsouffre tant, ce fut beaucoup plus par manque d’expérience que par vice\r\ndu cœur.\r\n\r\n                                                   ‘JEAN-AUGUSTE NEVEU.’\r\n\r\n 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was accompanied by a certificate from the doctor of the\r\n_Trusty_ hospital ship, and the supplicant was noted to be sent to\r\nFrance with the first batch of invalids.\r\n\r\nMany of the aforementioned letters are of the most touching description,\r\nand if some of them were shown to be the clever concoctions of desperate\r\nmen, there is a genuine ring about most which cannot fail to move our\r\npity. Lady Pigott was one of the many admirable English women who\r\ninterested themselves in the prisoners, and who, as usual, did so much\r\nof the good work which should have been done by those paid to do it. It\r\nis unfortunate for our national reputation that so many of the\r\nreminiscences of imprisonment in England which have come down to us have\r\nbeen those of angry, embittered men, and that so little written\r\ntestimony exists to the many great and good and kindly deeds done by\r\nEnglish men and women whose hearts went out to the unfortunate men on\r\nthe prison ships, in the prisons, and on parole, whose only crime was\r\nhaving fought against us. But that there were such acts is a matter of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                           LIFE ON THE HULKS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a dozen accounts by British, American, and French writers I have\r\nselected the following, as giving as varied a view as possible of this\r\nphase of the War Prison system.\r\n\r\nThe first account is by the Baron de Bonnefoux, who was captured with\r\nthe _Belle Poule_ in the West Indies by the _Ramillies_, Captain\r\nPickmore in 1806, was allowed on parole at Thame and at Odiham, whence\r\nhe broke parole, was captured, and taken to the _Bahama_ at Chatham.\r\n\r\nWhen Bonnefoux was at Chatham, there were five prison ships moored under\r\nthe lee of Sheppey between Chatham and Sheerness. He describes the\r\ninterior arrangements of a hulk, but it resembles exactly that of the\r\npainter Garneray whose fuller account I give next.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1835, the Baron says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It is difficult to imagine a more severe punishment; it is cruel to\r\nmaintain it for an indefinite period, and to submit to it prisoners of\r\nwar who deserve much consideration, and who incontestably are the\r\ninnocent victims of the fortune of war. The British prison ships have\r\nleft profound impressions on the minds of the Frenchmen who have\r\nexperienced them; an ardent longing for revenge has for long moved their\r\nhearts, and even to-day when a long duration of peace has created so\r\nmuch sympathy between the two nations, erstwhile enemies, I fear that,\r\nshould this harmony between them be disturbed, the remembrance of these\r\nhorrible places would be reawakened.’\r\n\r\n\r\nVery bitterly does the Baron complain of the bad and insufficient food,\r\nand of the ill-fitting, coarse, and rarely renewed clothing, and he is\r\none of those who branded the commanders of the prison ships as the\r\n‘rebuts’—the ‘cast-offs’ of the British navy.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners on the _Bahama_ consisted largely of privateer captains,\r\nthe most restless and desperate of all the prisoners of war, men who\r\nwere socially above the common herd, yet who had not the _cachet_ of the\r\nregular officers of the navy, who regarded themselves as independent of\r\nsuch laws and regulations as bound the latter, and who were also\r\nindependent in the sense of being sometimes well-to-do and even rich\r\nmen. At first there was an inclination among some of these to take\r\nBonnefoux down as an ‘aristo’; they ‘tutoyer’d’ him, and tried to make\r\nhim do the fagging and coolie work which, on prison ships as in schools,\r\nfell to the lot of the new-comer.\r\n\r\nBut the Baron from the first took up firmly the position of an officer\r\nand a gentleman, and showed the rough sea-dogs of the Channel ports that\r\nhe meant it, with the result that they let him alone.\r\n\r\nAttempted escapes were frequent. Although under constant fear of the\r\nlash, which was mercilessly used in the British army at this time, the\r\nsoldiers of the guard were ready enough to sell to the prisoners\r\nprovisions, maps, and instruments for effecting escape. One day in 1807\r\nfive of the prisoners attempted to get off in the empty water casks\r\nwhich the Chatham contractor took off to fill up. They got safely enough\r\ninto the water boat, unknown of course to its occupants (so it seems, at\r\nany rate, in this case, although there was hardly a man who had dealings\r\nwith the hulks who would not help the prisoners to escape for money),\r\nbut at nightfall the boat anchored in mid-stream; one of the prisoners\r\ngot stuck in his water-cask and called for aid; this was heard by the\r\ncabin-boy, who gave the alarm, the result being that the prisoners were\r\nhauled out of their hiding places, taken on board, and got ten days\r\nBlack Hole. The Black Hole was a prison six feet square at the bottom of\r\nthe hold, to which air only came through round holes not big enough for\r\nthe passage of a mouse. Once and once only in the twenty-four hours was\r\nthis _cachot_ visited for the purpose of bringing food and taking away\r\nthe latrine box. Small wonder that men often went mad and sometimes died\r\nduring a lengthened confinement, and that those who came out looked like\r\ncorpses.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned men were condemned to pay the cost of their capture,\r\nand, as they had no money, were put on half rations!\r\n\r\nThe time came round for the usual sending of aged and infirm prisoners\r\nto shore prisons. One poor chap sold his right to go to Bonnefoux, and\r\nhe and his friend Rousseau resolved to escape en route. Bonnefoux,\r\nhowever, was prevented from going, as his trunk had arrived from Odiham\r\nand he was required to be present to verify its contents.\r\n\r\nIn December 1807, three Boulogne men cut a hole just above the water\r\nnear the forward sentry box on the guard gallery which ran round the\r\noutside of the ship, and escaped. Others attempted to follow, but one of\r\nthem cried out from the extreme cold, was fired at and hauled on board.\r\nThree managed to get off to Dover and Calais, one stuck in the mud and\r\nwas drowned, and the Baron says that the captain of the _Bahama_ allowed\r\nhim to remain there until he rotted away, as a deterrent to would-be\r\nimitators.\r\n\r\nMilne, captain of the _Bahama_, the Baron says, was a drunken brute who\r\nheld orgies on board at which all sorts of loose and debased characters\r\nfrom the shore attended. Upon one occasion a fire was caused by these\r\nrevels, and the captain, who was drunk, gave orders that the prisoners\r\nshould be shot at should the fire approach them, rather than that they\r\nshould escape.\r\n\r\nA rough code of justice existed between the prisoners for the settlement\r\nof differences among themselves. One Mathieu, a privateersman, kept a\r\nsmall tobacco stall. A soldier, who already had a long bill running with\r\nhim, wanted tobacco on credit. Mathieu refused; the soldier snatched\r\nsome tobacco off the stall, Mathieu struck him with a knife and wounded\r\nhim badly. Mathieu was a very popular character, but justice had to be\r\ndone, even to a captive. Luckily the soldier recovered, and Mathieu got\r\noff with indemnification.\r\n\r\nDuring the very bad weather of March 1808, the sentries ordinarily on\r\nthe outer gallery were taken on board. To this gallery a boat was always\r\nmade fast, and the Baron, Rousseau, and another resolved to escape by\r\nit. So they cut the painter and got off, using planks for oars, with\r\nholes in them for handhold. They reached land safely, and hid all day in\r\na field, feeding on provisions they had brought from the _Bahama_. At\r\nnightfall they started, and, meeting a countryman, asked the way to\r\nChatham. ‘Don’t go there,’ he replied, ‘the bridge is guarded, and you\r\nwill be arrested.’ One of the prisoners, not knowing English, only\r\ncaught the last word, and, thinking it was ‘arrêtez’, drew a piece of\r\nfencing foil, with which each was armed, and threatened the man. The\r\nothers saved him, and in recognition he directed them to a village\r\nwhence they could cross the Medway. They walked for a long time until\r\nthey were tired, and reaching a cottage, knocked for admission. A big\r\nman came to the door. They asked hospitality, and threatened him in case\r\nof refusal. ‘My name is Cole,’ said the man, ‘I serve God, I love my\r\nneighbour, I can help you. Depend on me.’ They entered and were well\r\nentertained by Cole’s wife and daughter, and enjoyed the luxury of a\r\nnight’s rest in a decent bed. Next morning, Cole showed them how to\r\nreach the Dover road across the river, and with much difficulty was\r\npersuaded to accept a guinea for his services.\r\n\r\nSuch instances of pity and kindness of our country people for escaped\r\nprisoners are happily not rare, and go far to counterbalance the sordid\r\nand brutal treatment which in other cases they received.\r\n\r\nThat evening the fugitives reached Canterbury, and, after buying\r\nprovisions, proceeded towards Dover, and slept in a barn. Freedom seemed\r\nat hand when from Dover they had a glimpse of the French coast, but\r\nfortune still mocked them, for they sought in vain along the beach for a\r\nboat to carry them over. Boats indeed were there, but all oars, sails,\r\nand tackle had been removed from them in accordance with Government\r\nadvice circulated in consequence of the frequent escapes of French\r\nofficers on parole by stealing long-shore boats.\r\n\r\nSo they went on to Deal, and then to Folkestone. Here they were\r\nrecognized as escaping prisoners and were pursued, but they ran and got\r\nsafely away. They held a consultation and decided to go to Odiham in\r\nHampshire, where all of them had friends among the officers on parole\r\nthere, who would help them with money. The writer here describes the\r\ngreat sufferings they underwent by reason of the continuous bad weather,\r\ntheir poor clothing, their footsoreness, and their poverty. By day they\r\nsheltered in ditches, woods, and under hedges, and journeyed by night,\r\nhungry, wet to the skin, and in constant dread of being recognized and\r\narrested. For some unknown reason, instead of pushing westward for their\r\ndestination they went back to Canterbury, thence to London, then via\r\nHounslow Heath to Odiham, where they arrived more dead than alive,\r\nshoeless, their clothing in rags, and penniless. At Odiham they went to\r\none of the little houses on the outskirts of the town, built especially\r\nfor French prisoners. This house belonged to a Mr. R——, and here the\r\nthree men remained hidden for eight days. Suddenly the house was\r\nsurrounded by armed men, the Baron and his companions were arrested and\r\nput into the lock-up. Céré, a friend of the Baron’s, believed that R——\r\nhad betrayed them, and challenged him. A duel was fought in which R——\r\nwas badly wounded, and when he recovered he found that feeling among the\r\nFrenchmen in Odiham was so strong, that the Agent sent him away to\r\nScotland under a false name. At Odiham lock-up, Sarah Cooper, an old\r\nfriend of the Baron’s when he was on parole there, who had helped him to\r\nget away, came to see him and left him a note in which she said she\r\nwould help him to escape, and would not leave him until she had taken\r\nhim to France. The escape was planned, Sarah contrived to get him a rope\r\nladder and had a conveyance ready to take him away, but just as his foot\r\nwas on the ladder the police got the alarm, he was arrested, chained,\r\nand shut up in the _cachot_.\r\n\r\nFor three days the Baron remained in irons, and then was marched to\r\nChatham, so closely watched by the guards that every night the\r\nprisoner’s clothes and boots were removed, and were not returned until\r\nthe morning. They went to Chatham by way of London where they were\r\nconfined in the Savoy prison, then used for British deserters. These men\r\nwere friendly to the Frenchmen. All of them had been flogged, one had\r\nreceived 1,100 lashes, and was to receive 300 more.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1808, the unfortunate men found themselves once more on the\r\n_Bahama_, with a sentence of ten days in the Black Hole.\r\n\r\nCaptain Milne of the _Bahama_ was exasperated at these escapes, and\r\nattempts to escape, and was brutal in his endeavours to get hold of the\r\ntools with which the prisoners had worked. He tried the effect of\r\nstarvation, but this only fanned the spirit of revolt in the ship, the\r\nstate of life in which became very bad, threats, disputes, quarrels and\r\nduels being of everyday occurrence. The climax came when bad weather\r\nprevented the delivery of bread, and the prisoners were put on biscuit.\r\nThey assembled in the _parc_, the open space between the two batteries,\r\nforty feet square, and declared they would not disperse until other\r\nprovisions were served out. Milne was mad with anger and drink, and\r\nordered the soldiers to fire upon the prisoners, but the young officer\r\nin command would not respect the order, and, instead, counselled a more\r\nmoderate action. Bonnefoux managed to calm the prisoners, and determined\r\npersonally to interview Milne, and represented to him that to compel\r\neight hundred desperate, hungry men to descend from the _parc_ would\r\nmean bloodshed. The captain yielded, and peace was temporarily assured.\r\n\r\nHowever, more hole-boring was discovered; Rousseau, the Baron’s friend,\r\nslipped overboard and swam away, but was captured just as he was\r\nlanding; the result being that the watch kept was stricter than ever.\r\n\r\nThe Baron here dilates upon the frightful immorality of the life on the\r\n_Bahama_. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Il n’existait ni crainte, ni retenue, ni amour-propre dans la classe\r\nqui n’avait pas été dotée des bienfaits de quelque éducation. On y\r\nvoyait donc régner insolemment l’immoralité la plus perverse, les\r\noutrages les plus honteux à la pudeur et les actes les plus dégoûtants,\r\nle cynisme le plus effronté, et dans ce lieu de misère générale une\r\nmisère plus grande encore que tout ce qu’on peut imaginer.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were three classes of prisoners.\r\n\r\n(1) Les Raffalés. (2) Les Messieurs ou Bourgeois. (3) Les Officiers.\r\n\r\nThe Raffalés were the lowest, and lowest of the Raffalés were the\r\n‘Manteaux impériaux.’ These had nothing in the world but one covering,\r\nwhich swarmed with lice, hence the facetious allusion in their name to\r\nthe bees of the Imperial Mantle. These poor wretches eat nothing during\r\nthe day, for their gambling left them nothing to eat, but at night they\r\ncrept about picking up and devouring the refuse of the food. They slept\r\npacked closely side by side on the deck. At midnight the officer of the\r\nevening gave the word, ‘Par le flanc droit!’ and all turned on to their\r\nright sides. At 3 a.m. the word rang out ‘Pare à virer!’[3] and all\r\nturned on to their left sides.\r\n\r\nThey gambled with dice for their rations, hammocks, clothes, anything,\r\nand the winners sold for two sous what often was worth a franc. They had\r\na chief who was fantastically garbed, and a drummer with a wooden\r\n_gamelle_. Sometimes they were a terror to the other prisoners, but\r\ncould always be appeased with something to gamble with.\r\n\r\nBonnefoux’s companions worked in wood and straw. The _Bahama_ had been\r\ncaptured from the Spaniards and was built of cedar, and the wood\r\nextracted by the prisoners in making escape holes they worked into\r\nrazor-boxes and toilette articles. Bonnefoux himself gave lessons in\r\nFrench, drawing, mathematics, and English, and published an English\r\nGrammar, a copy of which is at Paris, in the Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\n\r\nGradually the spread of the taste for education had a refining and\r\ncivilizing effect on board the _Bahama_, and when Bonnefoux finally\r\nobtained parole leave, the condition of affairs was very much improved.\r\n\r\nIn June 1809 the Baron left the _Bahama_ for Lichfield, and with him was\r\nallowed to go one Dubreuil, a rough typical privateer captain, who never\r\nhad any money, but had a constant craving for tobacco. He had been kind\r\nto Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, whom he had taken prisoners, and who had\r\npromised to befriend him should luck turn against him. Bonnefoux had\r\nhelped him pecuniarily, and in return Dubreuil promised to teach him how\r\nto smoke through his eyes!\r\n\r\nThe next relation is that of Louis Garneray, a marine painter of some\r\nnote, specimens of whose work during his nine years’ captivity in\r\nEngland may still be found in Portsmouth and its neighbourhood, and one\r\nat least of whose later pictures is in the Marine Gallery of the Paris\r\nLouvre.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an analysis in brief of his book _Mes Pontons_ (which\r\nis, so far as I am aware, the most complete picture of life on a prison\r\nship yet published), and, being but a brief analysis, is incomplete as\r\nto numberless most interesting details, so that I would recommend any\r\nreader who wishes to be minutely informed upon the subject to read the\r\noriginal volume of 320 pages. It is caustically, even savagely written,\r\nbut nine years cut out of a young man’s life cannot serve to sweeten his\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nIn May 1806 Garneray, who had been captured in the West Indies, was\r\ntaken on board the hulk _Prothée_ at Portsmouth, stripped, plunged into\r\na cold bath, and clothed in an ill-fitting orange-yellow suit, on the\r\nback of which the large letters T. O. proclaimed him as under the care\r\nof the Transport Office. He describes the _Prothée_,—as he is hustled\r\ninto the mob of ‘dead people come out for a moment from their graves,\r\nhollow-eyed, earthy complexioned, round backed, unshaven, their frames\r\nbarely covered with yellow rags, their bodies frightfully thin,’—as a\r\nblack, shapeless sarcophagus, of which the only parts open to air was\r\nthe space between the fo’c’sle and the poop and the fo’c’sle itself,\r\nwhich was unbearable from the smoke of the many chimneys on it. Each end\r\nof the ship was occupied by the garrison, the officers aft and the\r\nsoldiers forward. A stout barrier divided the guard from the prisoners,\r\nwhich was so garnished with heavy-headed nails as to seem like iron, and\r\nwas fitted with loop-holes for inspection, and, if needs be, for firing\r\nthrough. On the lower deck and in the lower battery were packed seven\r\nhundred human beings.\r\n\r\nOnly one ladder communicated between the lower deck and the lower\r\nbattery. In the latter the only daylight came through port-holes, in the\r\nformer through narrow scuttles, all of which had iron gratings.\r\n\r\nAll round the ship, just above the water-line, ran a gallery with\r\nopen-work floor, and along this paced three sentries by day and seven by\r\nnight. The ship was commanded by a lieutenant and a master, and was\r\ngarrisoned by forty or fifty soldiers under a marine officer and about\r\ntwenty sailors. The day guard consisted of three sentries on the\r\ngallery, one on the ladder communicating with the battery, one on the\r\nfo’c’sle, one on each gangway, and on the poop a dozen armed men ready\r\nfor instant action. At night there were seven sentries on the gallery,\r\none on the battery ladder; an officer, a sergeant, a corporal, and a\r\ndozen sailors were continually moving round, and every quarter of an\r\nhour the ‘All’s well’ rang out.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s boats were slung ten feet above the water, and one was\r\nchained to the gallery aft.\r\n\r\nAt 6 a.m. in summer and 8 in winter, the port-holes were opened, and the\r\nair thus liberated was so foul that the men opening the port-holes\r\ninvariably jumped back immediately. At 6 p.m. in summer and 2 p.m. in\r\nwinter, every wall and grating was sounded with iron bars, and one hour\r\nlater all the prisoners were driven on deck and counted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GARNERAY DRAWING AN ENGLISH SOLDIER.\r\n\r\n  (_After Louis Garneray._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe only furniture in the ship was a bench along each side and four in\r\nthe middle, the prisoners squatting on deck at mess time. Each prisoner\r\non arrival received a hammock, a thin coverlet, and a hair mattress\r\nweighing from two to three pounds. For a long time no distinction was\r\nmade between officers and men, but latterly a special ship was allowed\r\nfor officers. Some idea of the crowding on board may be gained from the\r\nfacts that each battery, 130 feet long, 40 feet broad, and 6 feet high,\r\nheld nearly 400 prisoners, and that the hammocks were so closely slung\r\nthat there was no room to sleep on deck.\r\n\r\nThe alimentation of the prisoners, humane and ample as it looks on\r\npaper, seems to have been a gross sham. Not only did the contractors\r\ncheat in quality and quantity, but what with forfeitures on account of\r\nbreaches of discipline, and observance of the law imposed by the\r\nprisoners on themselves, that, deductions or no deductions, no man\r\nshould have a larger ration than another, and contributions to men\r\nplanning to escape, it was impossible for all to touch full rations.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners elected their own cooks, and nominally a committee of\r\nfifteen prisoners was allowed to attend at the distribution to see that\r\nquality and quantity were just, but the guards rarely allowed them to do\r\nso. Six men formed a mess; no spoons, knives or forks were supplied,\r\nmerely bowls and pannikins. The fish supplied on ‘maigre’\r\ndays—Wednesdays and Fridays—was usually uneatable, and the prisoners\r\noften sold the herrings at a penny each to the purveyors, who kept them\r\nfor redistribution, so that it was said that some herrings had done duty\r\nfor ten years! With the money thus made the prisoners bought butter or\r\ncheese. The cod they re-cooked; the bread was filthy and hard.\r\nComplaints were useless, and the result was constant hunger.\r\n\r\nAll but the Raffalés, the scum, occupied themselves with trades or\r\nprofessions. There were tobacco manufacturers, professors of dancing,\r\nfencing, and stick-play, who charged one sou for a lesson, which often\r\nlasted an hour. Mathematics and languages were taught at the same rate.\r\nWhilst these and many other occupations were busy, up and down the\r\nbattery passed the ‘merchants’ crying their wares, hungry men who\r\noffered their rags for sale, menders of shoes, and the occupants of\r\nfavourable positions in the battery inviting bids for them, so that\r\ndespite the rags and the hunger and the general misery, there was plenty\r\nof sound and movement, and general evidence of that capability for\r\nadapting themselves to circumstance which so invariably distinguished\r\nthe French prisoners in England from the British prisoners in France.\r\n\r\nGarneray’s chief friend on board was a sturdy Breton privateer Captain\r\nnamed Bertaud. Bertaud hated the English fiercely, and, being somewhat\r\nof a bruiser, had won the esteem of his companions quite as much by his\r\nissue of the following challenge as by his personal qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Challenge to the English! Long live French Brittany! The undersigned\r\nBertaud, native of Saint-Brieuc, annoyed at hearing the English boast\r\nthat they are the best boxers in the world, which is a lie, will fight\r\nany two of them, in any style with fists, but not to use legs.\r\n\r\n‘He will also, in order to prove his contempt for these boasters,\r\nreceive from his two adversaries ten blows with the fist before the\r\nfight wherever his adversaries choose, and afterwards he will thrash\r\nthem. Simply, he stipulates that as soon as he has received the ten\r\nblows and before the fight begins he shall be paid two pounds sterling\r\nto compensate him for the teeth which shall have been broken.\r\n\r\n‘Done on board the _Prothée_ where Bertaud mopes himself to death!’\r\n\r\n\r\nGarneray calls him a madman, and says that the ten blows alone will do\r\nfor him. What is his game?\r\n\r\n‘I shall pocket two pounds, and that will go into our escape fund,’\r\nreplied the Breton laughing.\r\n\r\nGarneray and Bertaud had been saving up for some time for the escape\r\nthey resolved to attempt, and, although Bertaud’s challenge was not\r\ntaken up, they at last owned forty-five shillings, to which Garneray’s\r\nwriting lessons at a shilling each to the little girl of the _Prothée’s_\r\ncommander chiefly contributed. Each made himself a bag of tarred cloth\r\nto hold clothes and provisions, they had bored a hole through the ship’s\r\nside large enough to slip through, and only waited for a dark quiet\r\nnight. As it was the month of July this soon came. Bertaud got through\r\nfirst, Garneray was on the point of following when a challenge rang out,\r\nfollowed by a musket-shot, and peeping through the hole, to his horror\r\nhe saw poor Bertaud suspended over the water by the cord of his bag\r\nwhich had caught in an unnoticed nail in the ship’s side. Then was a\r\nterrible thing done. The soldiers hammered the helpless Frenchman with\r\ntheir musket butts, Garneray heard the fall of something heavy in the\r\nwater; there was silence; then as if by magic the whole river was lit\r\nup, and boats from all the other vessels put off for the _Prothée_.\r\nGarneray slipped back to his hammock, but was presently turned out with\r\nall the other prisoners to be counted. His anxiety about the fate of his\r\nfriend made him ask a sailor, who replied brutally, ‘Rascal, how should\r\nI know? So far as I am concerned I wish every Frenchman was at the\r\nbottom of the sea!’ For a consideration of a shilling, however, the man\r\npromised to find out, and told Garneray that the poor Breton had\r\nreceived three bayonet thrusts, a sabre-cut on the head, and musket-butt\r\nblows elsewhere, but that the dog still breathed! For twenty days the\r\nman gave his shilling bulletins, and then announced that the Breton was\r\nconvalescent.\r\n\r\nGarneray and Bertaud made another attempt some months later. Garneray\r\nhad saved money he had earned by drawing designs for the straw-workers\r\namong the prisoners, who had hitherto not gone beyond birds and flowers,\r\nand who readily paid for his ships in full sail and other marine\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-winter and bitterly cold, so the two adventurers prepared\r\nthemselves by rubbing themselves with oil saved from the little lamp by\r\nwhich Garneray taught his pupils. Without attracting notice they slipped\r\noverboard, and swam for the muddy shore of an island. This they crossed\r\non _patins_ which Bertaud had provided, and reached the river by\r\nGosport. Only occasional pulls at the rum flask prevented them from\r\nperishing with cold, and their second swim nearly cost both of them\r\ntheir lives. Each in turn had to support the other, and they were on the\r\npoint of giving up when they reached an anchored vessel. Here a watchdog\r\ngreeted them, and kept up his barking until he aroused the crew, who\r\nhailed them in what they thankfully recognized to be broken English.\r\nAlas! Their joy was short-lived. The skipper of the vessel was a Dane,\r\nand so far from promising to help them declared he would send them back\r\nto the hulk, abusing them violently. This was too much for the fiery\r\nBreton, who, seizing a knife, sprang upon the Dane and bore him to the\r\nground. They tied and gagged him, and, said Bertaud, ‘Now let us be\r\noff!’\r\n\r\nBut Garneray declared himself too exhausted to attempt another swim,\r\neven for liberty, and said he would go back to the hulk. The prospect of\r\nthis was too horrible for Bertaud. ‘Better be drowned and be done with\r\nit,’ said he, ‘than live to be killed by inches,’ and before Garneray\r\ncould remonstrate, to the amazement of the Danish sailors, he sprang\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nAt four the next morning the Danes brought Garneray back to the\r\n_Prothée_. Instantly, although he was wet through and half dead with\r\ncold, he was put into the _cachot_, and but for the fact that the\r\ncarpenters had been working there and had left a pile of shavings,\r\namongst which he nestled, he could not have lived through the night.\r\nNext day he was released and sent back to the battery, but no fresh\r\nclothes were issued to him, and but for the charity of his fellow\r\nprisoners he would have gone naked.\r\n\r\nSeeing all the prisoners peering excitedly through the grated\r\nport-holes, Garneray, sick in his hammock, asked the reason: ‘See, the\r\ncrows!’ was the reply.\r\n\r\nHe joined the onlookers, and describes his feelings when he saw\r\nstretched on the mud of the Portchester river the body of Bertaud,\r\nalready an attraction for the crows. On the brutal scene which followed,\r\nthe dragging of the body to the ship, and the utterly inhuman response\r\nmade to Garneray’s prayer for the decent treatment of his friend’s\r\nremains, it is as unnecessary as it is distasteful to dwell.\r\n\r\nGarneray was now changed from the _Prothée_ to the _Crown_—a ship with a\r\nbad reputation among the prisoners.\r\n\r\nCaptain R—— of the _Crown_ was a brute in every sense of the word, and\r\nthe prisoners maddened him by winning for the _Crown_ the reputation of\r\nbeing the most unmanageable, because the worst managed, hulk in\r\nPortchester River. Bully, sot, and coward as he was, he by no means had\r\nhis own way. On one occasion five prisoners escaped. Although it was\r\nmid-winter and snowing, R—— had the muster of half-clad wretches made in\r\nthe open. The number could never be made right, and count after count\r\nwas made, during a space of three days. The whole affair was a cleverly\r\nconcocted device to gain for the escaped men time to get safely away. A\r\nmaster-carpenter among the prisoners had cut a means of communication\r\nbetween two of the batteries, through which, unseen by the authorities,\r\nmen could slip from one to the other, get on deck, and so swell or\r\ndiminish the muster roll as arranged. The trick was not discovered, but\r\nthat there was a trick was evident, and R—— was determined to be\r\nrevenged. He summoned the floating fire-engines in harbour, and,\r\nalthough it was mid-winter, actually pumped icy water into the lower\r\ndeck and batteries until they were drenched, as well as the prisoners,\r\ntheir hammocks, and their clothes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE _CROWN_ HULK, SEEN FROM THE STERN.\r\n\r\n  (_After Louis Garneray._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion when for counting purposes those on the _Crown_ were\r\ntransferred _en masse_ on board the _San Antonio_, they returned to find\r\nthat during their temporary absence R—— had actually, ‘as a measure of\r\nprecaution,’ he said, destroyed all the tools and implements and books\r\nwhich the prisoners used in their poor little occupations and trades,\r\nand among them Garneray’s canvases, easels, brushes, and colours. The\r\nimmediate result was a stupor of impotent rage; this gave way to open\r\ninsubordination, insult, and such a universal paroxysm of indignation\r\nthat even R—— was cowed, and actually made a show of leniency, offering\r\nterms of mediation which were scornfully rejected.\r\n\r\nGarneray relates another boxing episode with great gusto. A certain\r\nColonel S——, belonging to a well-known English family, came to visit\r\nCaptain R—— accompanied by a colossal negro, gorgeously arrayed, called\r\nLittle White, and a splendid Danish hound. His purpose was to match\r\nLittle White against a French boxer for the entertainment of his\r\nfashionable friends ashore. At first sight there would seem to be very\r\npoor sport in the pitting of a well-fed, well-trained giant against even\r\nthe fittest champion of a crowd of half-clad, half-starved, wholly\r\nuntrained prisoners of war. Although the real object of the gallant\r\nColonel was to show off his black pet, and to charm the beauty and\r\nfashion of Portsmouth with an exhibition of prowess, to prove that he\r\nwas simply animated by a love of sport, he had the consent of R—— that\r\nthe prisoner champion should be prepared in some way for the contest by\r\nextra feeding and so forth.\r\n\r\nRobert Lange, a quiet, inoffensive Breton with a quenchless hatred of\r\nthe English, and a reputed athlete, at once accepted the challenge,\r\nespecially as the (to him) enormous prize of twenty guineas was being\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nThe day appointed for the contest came. Great preparations had been made\r\non the poop of the _Crown_ for the reception of the fashionable company\r\ninvited to assist at the spectacle of Colonel S——‘s black knocking out\r\nin the first round, and probably killing, a Frenchman.\r\n\r\nColonel S—— arrived, and with him Little White and the big dog, and\r\nflotillas of boats brought out the company, largely consisting of\r\nladies, ‘parées avec ce luxe éclatant et de mauvais goût si\r\nessentiellement britannique,’ who settled themselves on the stand rigged\r\nup for the occasion, in laughing and chattering anticipation of\r\nsomething funny.\r\n\r\nRobert Lange was playing cards below when he was told that the\r\nentertainment was only wanting him. Very coolly he sent word back that\r\nhe would come as soon as he had finished his hand, and nothing would\r\ninduce him to hurry. Captain R—— wanted to put Lange into the _cachot_\r\nat once for this impertinence, but Colonel S—— calmed him by assuring\r\nhim that it was the custom in England to grant any indulgence to a man\r\ncondemned to die.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Little White divested himself of his gorgeous flunkey dress,\r\nand the appearance of his magnificent physique caused a chorus of\r\nadmiration for him, and of pity for the presumptuous Frenchman, to burst\r\nfrom the company.\r\n\r\nIn due course Robert Lange slouched up, his hands in his pockets, a pipe\r\nin his mouth, and his cotton cap on the back of his head. His appearance\r\nbrought out a murmur of disappointment from the visitors, who considered\r\nthey were being made the victims of one of Colonel S——‘s famous hoaxes.\r\nThe murmurs turned to smiles when Robert confessed ignorance about\r\nseconds, and asked what a watch was wanted for. However, these things\r\nbeing explained to him, he chose Garneray and a fellow Breton as\r\nseconds, told Garneray to pocket the magnificent watch which the Colonel\r\noffered him, said he was ready for the dance to begin, and placed\r\nhimself in a fighting position which occasioned roars of laughter from\r\nthe polite crowd.\r\n\r\n‘I’m beginning to lose my temper at the mockery of these fools,’ said\r\nLange to Garneray; ‘what are they waiting for?’\r\n\r\n‘Colonel,’ said Garneray, ‘my man is ready. May we begin?’\r\n\r\n‘There is just one formality customary on these occasions,’ replied the\r\nColonel. ‘The combatants ought to shake hands to show there is no\r\nill-feeling between them.’\r\n\r\nThe big black thrust forward his hand saying, ‘Shake my hand with\r\nrespect. It has bowled over many a Frenchman.’\r\n\r\nAt this gratuitous insult, which the English applauded, a thrill of\r\nindignation agitated the crowd of French prisoners.\r\n\r\n‘What does this chap say?’ asked Lange of Garneray.\r\n\r\nGarneray told him. Instantly there sprang into his face and into his\r\neyes a light of anger very unusual to him, and what Garneray feared was\r\nthat the furious Breton would violate the laws of combat and spring upon\r\nthe negro before the latter had taken up his fighting position. But it\r\nwas not so. Let me translate Garneray’s description of what followed:\r\n‘At length Robert Lange seized the negro’s hand. Their hands entwined,\r\ntheir gaze fixed, their inflamed faces close together, the two\r\ncombatants motionless, resembled a marble group. By degrees, it seemed\r\nto me that on the face of Little White there was a look of pain. I was\r\nnot wrong. Suddenly with a cry of pain which he had been suppressing the\r\nnegro bit his lip with passion, half closed his eyes, threw his head\r\nback as he raised his shoulder convulsively, and seemed to lose\r\nconsciousness. All this time the Breton was as calm and motionless as a\r\nstatue. What was going on was something so unforeseen, so extraordinary\r\nthat we did not know what to think of it. Robert Lange solved the\r\nriddle.\r\n\r\n‘“Wretch!” he cried with a resounding voice. “This hand which has done\r\nfor so many Bretons shall not henceforth frighten a child!”\r\n\r\n‘In fact, the hand of the Breton had gripped the negro’s with such force\r\nthat the blood sprang from its fingers.\r\n\r\n‘“Stop! stop!” cried the black in his agony. But Robert was pitiless,\r\nand did not loosen his grasp until the giant was on his knees before\r\nhim.’\r\n\r\nAn enthusiastic burst of cheering rose from the French prisoner\r\nspectators, and, to cut the story short, the Colonel handed Robert Lange\r\nthe twenty guineas, and was obliged to apologize to the gay company\r\nassembled to see the triumph of the negro, for the unexpected and brief\r\ncharacter of the entertainment.\r\n\r\nThen he called his big Danish hound and prepared to embark. But the dog\r\ndid not appear and could not be found. Somebody said he had last been\r\nseen going into the battery. Captain R—— started, and his face reddened\r\ndeeply. ‘Then—then,’ he stammered. ‘If your dog has got into the\r\nbattery, you will never see him again!’\r\n\r\n‘Never see him again! What do you mean?’ roared the Colonel.\r\n\r\n‘I mean that by this time he represents two legs of mutton, several\r\ndishes of “ratatouille”, and any number of _beeftaks_! In other words,\r\nthe prisoners have eaten him!’\r\n\r\nIt was even so. The vision of a large plump dog had been too much for\r\nthe Raffalés, and as the irate Colonel was rowed shorewards from the\r\nship, he saw the skin of his pet nailed on to the outer side of it.\r\n\r\nCaptain R—— revenged himself for the double fiasco by a series of brutal\r\npersecutions and punishments which culminated in open rebellion, severe\r\nfighting, much bloodshed, and at last in a proclamation by the Captain\r\nthat unless the ringleaders were delivered up to him, imploring pardon\r\nfor what had happened, he would have every man shot.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the long duration and intensity of Captain R——‘s\r\npersecution had reached the ears of the authorities, and just at the\r\nexpiration of the hour which he had given the prisoners for decision,\r\nthe great folk of the Admiralty arrived, and the result of a court of\r\ninquiry which lasted the whole day, and which even Garneray admits was\r\nconducted with impartiality, was that he was removed.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later Garneray observed two of the worst of the Raffalés\r\nseated on a bench playing ecarté very seriously, and surrounded by a\r\nsilent and equally serious crowd. Suspecting that this was no ordinary\r\ngambling bout, he inquired, and was told that by a drawing of lots these\r\ntwo men had been left to decide who should kill the ship’s master, one\r\nLinch, the worst type of hulk tyrant. In vain Garneray exerted himself\r\nto prevent the committal of so terrible a crime. The game was played\r\nout, and five minutes later the master was stabbed to the heart as he\r\nstood on the upper deck.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1811 the _Vengeance_, to which hulk Garneray had been\r\nshifted from the _Crown_, received her quota of the unfortunate\r\nFrenchmen who, after the capitulation of Baylen in 1808, had been\r\nimprisoned by the Spaniards on the island of Cabrera, where they had\r\nbeen submitted to the most terrible sufferings and hardships, and had\r\ndied like flies. Garneray describes the appearance of thirty of these\r\npoor creatures who had been apportioned to the _Vengeance_, as they came\r\nalongside.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The poor wretches, lying at the bottom of the boat, cried aloud in\r\ntheir agony and tossed in the delirium of fever; thin as skeletons, pale\r\nas corpses, scarcely covered, although the cold was intense, by their\r\nmiserable rags.... Of these thirty only about ten had strength enough to\r\nget on board.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor of the _Vengeance_ refused to receive them on board, saying\r\nthat by their infection they would in a fortnight’s time turn the ship\r\ninto one great tomb, and they were ordered to be put on board the\r\n_Pegasus_ hospital ship. While the arrangements for their reception were\r\nbeing made, the unfortunates were kept in their agony in the boat\r\nalongside, for the captain of the _Vengeance_ said it was not worth\r\nwhile to disarrange his ship for such men, for so short a time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EXTERIOR VIEW OF A HULK.\r\n\r\n  (_After Louis Garneray._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nMore brutality followed. The captain of the _Pegasus_ sent word that the\r\npoor wretches should be bathed before being sent to him, saying that his\r\nhospital was so full that he had no accommodation of this sort. And this\r\nwas actually done; they were plunged into icy cold water, and then\r\npacked off to the _Pegasus_, the result being that many of them were\r\nhauled on board dying.\r\n\r\nAs the doctor of the _Vengeance_ predicted, the infection brought by the\r\nsurvivors of Cabrera spread through the ship with terrible severity, and\r\nGarneray himself was seized with fever, and was sent on board the\r\n_Pegasus_. He tells how by the intervention of a fellow-countryman who\r\nwas a hospital assistant, he contrived to avoid the horrors of the\r\ncompulsory cold bath on entrance, and proceeds to relate a circumstance\r\nwhich, horrible as it is, I give for what it is worth.\r\n\r\nA neighbour invalid had a diamond ring on his finger. He was a soldier\r\nof Spain, and the ring no doubt had been obtained, as Garneray says, ‘by\r\nthe luck of war’. He was very far gone; indeed his death could only be a\r\nmatter of a few hours. Garneray, rapidly becoming convalescent, heard\r\ntwo English attendants conspire to take the dying man away at once to\r\nthe mortuary and there to relieve him of his ring. They carried him\r\naway; Garneray called for his French friend, and bid him go at once and\r\nprevent the brutal deed. He did so, and the man actually recovered, but\r\nhe told Garneray that it was quite the rule in this crowded hospital\r\nship for patients to be hurried away before they were dead into the\r\nmortuary in order to make room for others!\r\n\r\nGarneray says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It is difficult to give the reader an idea of the barbarous manner in\r\nwhich the French were treated on this hospital ship. I will only give\r\none more instance, for my aim is not to horrify, and there were acts of\r\ncruelty which the pen hesitates to describe. One day the English doctor\r\nwas asked to authorize wine to be given to a young officer, grievously\r\nill, in order to strengthen him. “Are you mad?” replied the doctor. “To\r\ndare to ask me to give strength to an enemy? Get out! You must be a\r\nfool!”’\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Garneray returned to the _Vengeance_ he had news of the Baron de\r\nBonnefoux—extracts from whose life upon the Chatham hulks have already\r\nbeen given,—and speaks of him as bent upon escaping, and fears he would\r\nbe shot one of these days.\r\n\r\nGarneray later is allowed to go on parole to Bishop’s Waltham, about his\r\nsojourn at which place something will be said when the story of the\r\nPrisoners on Parole comes to be told. Suffice it therefore to say that\r\nGarneray got away from Bishop’s Waltham to Portsmouth, and well across\r\nthe Channel on a smuggling vessel, when he was recaptured by a British\r\ncruiser, and once again found himself a prisoner on the _Vengeance_.\r\nAfter more sufferings, brutal treatment, and illness, Garneray was at\r\nlength made free by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE VENGEANCE.\r\n\r\n  (_After Louis Garneray._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                    LIFE ON THE HULKS—(_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nI next give the remarks of Colonel Lebertre, who, having broken his\r\nparole by escaping from Alresford, was captured, and put on the _Canada_\r\nhulk at Chatham. This was in 1811. He complains bitterly that officers\r\nin the hulks were placed on a level with common prisoners, and even with\r\nnegroes, and says that even the _Brunswick_, which was considered a\r\nbetter hulk than the others, swarmed with vermin, and that although\r\ncleanliness was strongly enjoined by the authorities, no allowance for\r\nsoap was made, no leave given to bathe even in summer, and that fresh\r\nclothing was very rarely issued.\r\n\r\nBut most strongly does he condemn the conduct of the idle curious who\r\nwould come off from the shore to see the prisoners on the hulks.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Les femmes même ont montré une indifférence vraiment choquante. On en a\r\nvu rester des heures entières les yeux fixés sur le Parc où se tiennent\r\nles prisonniers, sans que e spectacle de misère qui affecterait si\r\nvivement une Française ait fait couler une seule larme; le rire\r\ninsultant était, au contraire, sur leurs lèvres. Les prisonniers n’ont\r\nconnu qu’un seul exemple d’une femme qui s’évanouît à la vue du Parc.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons on December 26, 1812, during a debate upon the\r\ncondition of the foreign prisoners of war in England, Croker, Secretary\r\nto the Admiralty, declared that he had inspected the hulks at\r\nPortsmouth, and had found the prisoners thereon ‘comfortable and happy\r\nand well provided with amusement’, and Sir George Warrender said much\r\nthe same about Chatham.\r\n\r\nColonel Lebertre remarks on this:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Men sensual and hardened by pleasures! You who in full Parliament\r\noutrage your victims and declare that the prisoners are happy! Would you\r\nknow the full horror of their condition, come without giving notice\r\nbeforehand; dare to descend before daylight into the tombs in which you\r\nbury living creatures who are human beings like yourselves; try to\r\nbreathe for one minute the sepulchral vapour which these unfortunates\r\nbreathe for many years, and which sometimes suffocates them; see them\r\ntossing in their hammocks, assailed by thousands of insects, and wooing\r\nin vain the sleep which could soften for one moment their sufferings!’\r\n\r\n\r\nHe describes, as did the Baron de Bonnefoux, the Raffalés who sold all\r\ntheir clothes, and went naked in obedience to one of the laws of their\r\n_camaraderie_, who slept huddled together for warmth in ranks which\r\nchanged position by words of command. He says that some of the prisoners\r\nwere so utterly miserable that they accepted pay from the authorities to\r\nact as spies upon their fellows. He describes the rude courts of justice\r\nheld, and instances how one man who stole five louis received thirty\r\nblows with a rope’s end; he refers to the terrible vice prevalent upon\r\nthe prison ships, and remarks that ‘life on them is the touchstone of a\r\nman’s character’.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived on the _Canada_ there was no vacant sleeping place, but\r\nfor 120 francs he bought a spot in the middle of the battery, not near a\r\nport, ‘just big enough to hold his dead body’. Still, he admits that the\r\nofficers treated him with as much consideration as their orders would\r\nallow.\r\n\r\nOn August 11, 1812, in response to many urgent remonstrances from\r\ninfluential prisoners against the custom of herding officers and men\r\ntogether, all the officers on the hulks at Chatham were transferred to\r\nthe lower or thirty-six gun battery of the _Brunswick_, in number 460.\r\nHere they had to submit to the same tyranny as on the other ships,\r\nexcept that they were allowed to have wine if they could afford to pay\r\nsix francs a bottle for it, which few of them could do. Later, General\r\nPillet and other ‘broke paroles’, on account of the insulting letters\r\nthey wrote on the subject of being allowed rum or other spirits, were\r\nconfined to the regulation small beer. The Transport Office wrote:\r\n‘Indeed, when the former unprincipled conduct of these officers is\r\nconsidered, with their present combination to break through the rules,\r\nobviously tending to insurrection and a consequent renewal of bloodshed,\r\nwe think it proper that they should immediately be removed to separate\r\nprison ships.’\r\n\r\nWe now come to the most rabid of the Frenchmen, General Pillet. Pillet\r\nwas severely wounded and taken prisoner at Vimiero in 1808, and—in\r\nviolation, he says, of the second article of the Convention of Cintra,\r\nwhich provided that no French should be considered prisoners of war, but\r\nshould be taken out of Portugal with arms, &c., by British ships—was\r\nbrought to England, with many other officers. He was at once allowed to\r\nbe on parole at Alresford, but, not considering himself bound by any\r\nparole terms, attempted to escape with Paolucci, Captain of the\r\n_Friedland_ captured in 1808 by the _Standard_ and _Active_, but was\r\nrecaptured and sent to the dépôt at Norman Cross. Here his conduct was\r\nso reprehensible that he was sent to the _Brunswick_ at Chatham. From\r\nthe _Brunswick_ he tried to escape in a vegetable boat, but this attempt\r\nfailed, and it is to the subsequent rigour of his treatment that must be\r\nattributed his vitriolic hatred of Britain.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pillet is of opinion that the particular branch of the Navy told\r\noff for duty on the prison ships was composed of the most miserable scum\r\nof English society; of men who have either been accomplices in or guilty\r\nof great crimes, and who had been given by the magistrates the\r\nalternative of being marines or of being hanged!\r\n\r\nHe speaks of the Chatham hulks as abominably situated near foul\r\nmarshes—which is undeniably true. The quarters of the prisoners were in\r\nno place high enough for a man to stand upright; fourteen little ports,\r\nunglazed but barred, of seventeen inches square, on each side of the\r\ndeck, gave all the light and air obtainable. When they were shut they\r\nwere fast shut, so that during the winter months the prisoners breathed\r\nfoul air for sixteen hours a day. Hence they went naked, and so, when\r\nthe cold air was admitted the results were fatal. The overcrowding of\r\nthe hulks, says Pillet, was part of the great Government design of\r\nkilling the prisoners, and asserts that even a London newspaper, quoting\r\nthe opinion of a medical board in London, said that the strongest of\r\nmen, after six years’ life on the hulks, must be physically wrecked for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe hammock space allowed was six feet in length, but swinging reduced\r\nthem to four and a half. Newcomers were often obliged to sleep on the\r\nbare deck, as there was no other vacant space, and there was no\r\ndistinction of ranks. However, officers were generally able to buy\r\nspaces, upon which practice Pillet remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘C’est une misérable spéculation pour un pauvre prisonnier affamé; il\r\nconsent à vendre sa place afin de se procurer un peu plus de vivre\r\npendant quelques jours, et afin de ne pas mourir de faim il accélère la\r\ndestruction de sa santé, et se réduit dans cette horrible situation à\r\ncoucher sur un plancher ruisselant d’eau, l’évaporisation des\r\ntranspirations forcées qui a lieu dans ce séjour d’angoisses et de la\r\nmort.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHe declares that the air is so foul when the decks are shut up that the\r\ncandles will not burn, and he has heard even the guards call for help\r\nwhen they have opened the hatches and the air has escaped. The food he\r\ndescribes as execrable, so that the two boats which had the monopoly of\r\ncoming alongside to sell butter, tea, coffee, sugar, potatoes, candles,\r\nand tobacco at a price one-third above that on land, did a roaring\r\ntrade. The general reply to complaints was that any food was good enough\r\nfor French dogs.\r\n\r\nIf they were badly fed, says Pillet, they were worse clothed. Nominally\r\nthey received every eighteen months a coat, waistcoat, breeches, two\r\npairs of stockings, two shirts, a pair of shoes, and a cap. He declares\r\nhe can prove that the prisoners did not receive this complete rig-out\r\nonce in four years, and that if a prisoner had any rags of his own, or\r\nreceived any money, he got no clothes! What clothes they did get were so\r\nbadly made that they generally had to be re-made. He says that at\r\nPortsmouth, where the hulk agent Woodriff was at any rate conscientious\r\nenough to issue the clothes on the due dates, his secretary would buy\r\nback the shirts at one shilling each, and so, as Government paid three\r\nshillings each for them, and there were at Portsmouth, Forton, and\r\nPortchester some twelve thousand prisoners on the average, his\r\n‘pickings’ must have been considerable!\r\n\r\nIn a note he gives the instance of the reply of Commander Mansell, who\r\ncommanded the prison-ship police at Chatham in 1813, when the fact that\r\nnot one quarter of the clothing due to the prisoners had been delivered\r\nto them, was proved clearly: ‘I am afraid it is too true, but I have\r\nnothing to do with it. I cannot help it.’\r\n\r\nFrom the _Carnet d’Étapes du Sergt.-Maj. Beaudouin, 31^e demi-brigade de\r\nligne_, I take the following account of life on the hulks.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘On October 31st, 1809, Beaudouin left Valleyfield where he had been\r\nconfined since June 10th, 1804, and came on board the _Bristol_ hulk at\r\nChatham. At this time the hulks were the _Glory_, three decker,\r\n_Bristol_, _Crown Prince_, _Buckingham_, _Sampson_ (_mauvais sujets_),\r\n_Rochester_, _Southwick_, _Irresistible_, _Bahama_ (Danes), and\r\n_Trusty_, hospital ship, holding in all 6,550 prisoners.’\r\n\r\n\r\nBeaudouin says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The difference between the land prisons and the hulks is very marked.\r\nThere is no space for exercise, prisoners are crowded together, no\r\nvisitors come to see them, and we are like forsaken people. There is no\r\nwork but the _corvées_ to get our water, and to scrape in winter and\r\nwash in summer our sleeping place. In a word, only to see them is to be\r\nhorrified. The anchorage at Chatham is bounded by low and ill-cultured\r\nshores; the town is two miles away—a royal dockyard where there is much\r\nship-building. At the side of it is a fine, new, well-armed fort, and\r\nadjoining it a little town named Rochester, where there are two\r\nwindmills, and two more in Chatham. By the London road, three miles off,\r\nthere are four windmills. The people of this country are not so pleasant\r\nand kind as in Scotland, in fact I believe “the sex” is not so\r\nbeautiful.’\r\n\r\n\r\nVery soon the _Bristol_ was condemned and its prisoners transferred to\r\nthe _Fyen_, and at the same time the _Rochester_ and _Southwick_ were\r\nreplaced by the _Canada_ and _Nassau_. On the _Fyen_ were 850 prisoners,\r\nbut during 1810 and 1811 a great many Chatham prisoners were sent to\r\nNorman Cross and Scotland.\r\n\r\nBeaudouin comments thus bitterly:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It is unfortunate for me that my circle of acquaintances is so limited,\r\nand that I cannot therefore make sufficiently known the crimes of a\r\nnation which aims at the supremacy in Europe. It poses as an example\r\namong nations, but there are no brigands or savages as well versed in\r\nwickedness as it is. Day by day they practise their cruelties upon us,\r\nunhappy prisoners. That is where they are cowardly fighters! against\r\ndefenceless men! Half the time they give us provisions which the very\r\ndogs refuse. Half the time the bread is not baked, and is only good to\r\nbang against a wall; the meat looks as if it had been dragged in the mud\r\nfor miles. Twice a week we get putrid salt food, that is to say,\r\nherrings on Wednesday, cod-fish on Saturday. We have several times\r\nrefused to eat it, and as a result got nothing in its place, and at the\r\nsame time are told that anything is good enough for a Frenchman. Therein\r\nlies the motive of their barbarity.’\r\n\r\n\r\nA short description of the terrible _Sampson_ affair is given elsewhere\r\n(p. 93), but as Beaudouin was evidently close by at the time, his more\r\ndetailed account is perhaps worth quoting.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘On the _Sampson_ the prisoners refused to eat the food. The English\r\nallowed them to exist two days without food. The prisoners resolved to\r\nforce the English to supply them with eatable provisions. Rather than\r\ndie of hunger they all went on deck and requested the captain either to\r\ngive them food or to summon the Commandant of the anchorage. The brute\r\nreplied that he would not summon the Commandant, and that they should\r\nhave no other provisions than those which had been served out to them\r\ntwo days previously. The prisoners refused to touch them. The “brigand”\r\nthen said: “As you refuse to have this food, I command you to return\r\nbelow immediately or I will fire upon you.” The prisoners could not\r\nbelieve that he really meant what he said and refused to go below.\r\n\r\n‘Hardly had they made this declaration, when the Captain gave the word\r\nto the guard to fire, which was at once done, the crowd being fired\r\nupon. The poor wretches, seeing that they were being fired upon without\r\nany means of defence, crowded hastily down, leaving behind only the\r\nkilled and wounded—fifteen killed and some twenty wounded! Then the\r\nCaptain hoisted the mutiny signal which brought reinforcements from the\r\nother ships, and all were as jubilant as if a great victory had been\r\nwon.\r\n\r\n‘I do not believe that any Frenchman lives who hates this nation more\r\nthan I do; and all I pray for is that I may be able to revenge myself on\r\nit before I die.’\r\n\r\n\r\nBeaudouin wrote a poem of 514 alexandrines, entitled:\r\n\r\n                         _Les Prisons d’Albion.\r\n       Ou la malheureuse situation des prisonniers en Angleterre.\r\n                     Bellum nobis haec mala fecit._\r\n\r\nI give in the original the first and last ‘chants’ of this embittered\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n                                     I\r\n\r\n         ‘Tu veux, mon cher ami, que ranimant ma verve\r\n         Je te peigne sans fard, sans crainte, et sans réserve,\r\n         Le Tableau des tourmens et de l’affliction\r\n         Sous lesquels sont plongés les captifs d’Albion.\r\n         J’obéis à la voix, et ma muse craintive,\r\n         Entonnant à regret la trompette plaintive,\r\n         Va chanter sur des tons, hélas! bien douloureux,\r\n         Les maux, les maux cuisans de bien des malheureux.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     LXIV\r\n\r\n         ‘Je t’ai dépeint sans fard l’exacte vérité,\r\n         Tels sont les maux cruels de la captivité.\r\n         O vous qui de bonheur goûtez en paix les charmes,\r\n         Si vous lisez mes vers, donnez-nous quelques larmes;\r\n         S’ils n’impriment chez vous une tendre affection,\r\n         Vous êtes, plus que nous, dignes de compassion!’\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the horrible moral effects of the bad treatment he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The ruin of their comrades and the depravities which were daily\r\ncommitted in public, impressed right thinking men with so frightful\r\nforce that this place means a double suffering to them.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1812 it was reported that a batch of incurables would be sent home to\r\nFrance, and Beaudouin resolved to get off with them by making himself\r\nill. He starved himself into such a condition that he was sent into\r\nhospital, but the doctor would not pass him as an incurable. He\r\nswallowed tobacco juice, and at last, in a miserable state, turned up\r\nwith the candidates. Then it was announced that no privateersmen, but\r\nonly regular seamen, would be sent. Beaudouin, being a soldier, and\r\nbeing among the privateersmen, was in despair. However, a kindly English\r\ndoctor pitied him, cured him of his self-inflicted illness, and got him\r\nleave to go.\r\n\r\nOn June 2, 1812, he was ready to sail, but was searched first for\r\nletters. Luckily none were discovered, although he had sixty sewn\r\nbetween the soles of his shoes, and 200 in a box with a double bottom.\r\nHe sailed on June 4, the king’s birthday—that day eight years previously\r\nhe had arrived at Greenock amidst the Royal salutes—arrived at Morlaix,\r\nand so home to Boiscommun (Loiret), canton of Beaune-la-Rolande,\r\narrondissement of Pithiviers.\r\n\r\nThe following experiences of an American prisoner of war are from _The\r\nJournal of a Young Man of Massachusetts_, (1816), who was a surgeon, by\r\nname Benjamin Waterhouse, captured at sea in May 1813, and confined on\r\nMelville Island, Halifax, whence he was transported to Chatham, and then\r\nto Dartmoor. The account is interesting as showing the very marked\r\ndifference between the American and the French prisoners of war, and is\r\notherwise remarkable for the hatred and contempt of the writer for\r\nBritons in general and for Scotsmen in particular, entire pages being\r\ndevoted to their vilification. Waterhouse, with a hundred of his\r\ncountrymen, was shipped to England on the _Regulus_, and his complaints\r\nare bitter about the shameful treatment on board—the filth, the\r\nsemi-starvation, the vermin, the sleeping on stone ballast, the lack of\r\nair owing to the only opening to the lower deck being a hatchway two\r\nfeet square, the brutal rule of allowing only two prisoners to go on\r\ndeck at a time, and the presence in their midst of the only latrine. The\r\ncaptain, a Scotsman, would only yield to constant petitions and\r\nremonstrances so far as to sanction the substitution of iron bars for\r\nthe hatchway.\r\n\r\nAfter a miserable voyage the prisoners reached Portsmouth, and, starved,\r\nvermin-eaten, and in rags, were shipped off to the _Crown Prince_,\r\nCaptain Hutchison, at Chatham, where were thirteen other prison ships\r\nand some 1,200 Americans. On this hulk, Waterhouse says, they fared ‘as\r\nwell as could be expected ... not that we fared so well as British\r\nprisoners fare in America’, the daily allowance being half a pound of\r\nbeef, one gill of barley, one and a half pounds of bread, on five days\r\nof the week, and on the others one pound cod fish, and one pound\r\npotatoes, or one pound smoked herring, porter and beer being\r\npurchasable. He dilates bitterly on the extraordinary lack of humanity\r\nin John Bull, as evidenced by the hard fare of soldiers and sailors, the\r\nscoundrelism of some officers, especially those of the provisioning\r\ndepartments, and, above all, the shockingly cruel punishments in the\r\nArmy and Navy. During the daytime, he says, life on a prison ship was\r\nnot so unpleasant, but at night the conditions were very bad—especially\r\nas American prisoners were more closely watched and guarded than were\r\nmen of other nationalities. ‘The French were always busy in some little\r\nmechanical employ, or in gaming, or in playing the fool, but the\r\nAmericans seemed to be on the rack of invention to escape.’\r\n\r\nAmongst themselves, the Americans elected by voting, every four weeks, a\r\nPresident, and twelve Committee men, whose functions were to make\r\nwholesome laws, to define crimes and award punishments, and particularly\r\nto insist upon personal cleanliness. The punishments were fines,\r\nwhippings, and in very extreme cases the Black Hole. The volubility and\r\nthe eloquence of the orators at these Committee Meetings very much\r\nimpressed the British officers. The Frenchmen, Waterhouse says, were\r\nalmost to a man gamblers:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Their skill and address at these games of apparent hazard were far\r\nsuperior to the Americans. They seemed calculated for gamesters; their\r\nvivacity, their readiness, and their everlasting professions of\r\nfriendship were nicely adapted to inspire confidence in the unsuspecting\r\nAmerican Jack Tar, who has no legerdemain about him. Most of the\r\nprisoners were in the way of earning a little money; but almost all of\r\nthem were deprived of it by the French gamesters. Our people stood no\r\nchance with them, but were commonly stripped of every cent, whenever\r\nthey set out seriously to play with them. How often have I seen a\r\nFrenchman capering, singing, and grinning in consequence of his\r\nstripping one of our sailors of all his money; ... the officers among\r\nthem are the most adroit gamesters. We have all tried hard to respect\r\nthem; but there is something in their conduct so much like swindling,\r\nthat I hardly know what to say of them. When they knew that we had\r\nreceived money for the work we had been allowed to perform, they were\r\nvery attentive, and complaisant and flattering.... They would come round\r\nand say: “Ah! Boston fine town, very pretty—Cape Cod fine town, very\r\nfine! Town of Rhode Island superb! Bristol Ferry very pretty! General\r\nWashington _très grand homme_, General Madison _brave homme_!” With\r\nthese expressions and broken English, they would accompany, with their\r\nmonkey tricks, capering and grinning and patting us on the shoulder,\r\nwith: “The Americans are brave men—fight like Frenchmen;” and by their\r\ninsinuating manners allure our men once more to their wheels of fortune\r\nand billiard-tables, and as sure as they did, so sure did they strip\r\nthem of all their money.’\r\n\r\nWaterhouse adds that ‘if an American, having lost all his money, wanted\r\nto borrow of a Frenchman under promise of repayment, the latter would\r\nsay: “Ah mon ami! I am sorry, very sorry, indeed; it is _la fortune de\r\nguerre_. If you have lost your money you must win it back again; that is\r\nthe fashion in my country—we no lend, that is not the fashion!”...\r\n\r\n‘There were here some Danes as well as Dutchmen. It is curious to\r\nobserve their different looks and manners.... Here we see the\r\nthick-skulled plodding Dane, making a wooden dish; or else some of the\r\nmost ingenious making a clumsy ship; while others submitted to the\r\ndirtiest drudgery of the hulk, for money; and there we see a Dutchman,\r\npicking to pieces tarred ropes ... or else you see him lazily stowed\r\naway in some corner, with his pipe ... while here and there and every\r\nwhere, you find a lively singing Frenchman, working in hair, or carving\r\nout of a bone, a lady, a monkey, or the central figure of the\r\ncrucifixion! Among the specimens of American ingenuity I most admired\r\ntheir ships, which they built from three to five feet long.... Had not\r\nthe French proved themselves to be a very brave people, I should have\r\ndoubted it by what I have observed of them on board the prison-ship.\r\nThey would scold, quarrel and fight, by slapping each other’s chops with\r\nthe flat hand, and cry like so many girls.... Perhaps such a man as\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte could make any nation courageous.’\r\n\r\n\r\nVery bitter were the complaints of the Americans about the supine and\r\nindifferent attitude towards them of Beasley, their agent, who was\r\nsupposed to keep constant watch and ward over the interests of his\r\nunfortunate countrymen. He lived in London, thirty-two miles away, paid\r\nno attention to complaints forwarded to him, and was heartily hated and\r\ndespised. Once he paid a visit to the hulks in Gillingham Creek, but\r\nseemed anxious to avoid all interviews and questionings, and left amidst\r\na storm of hisses and jeers.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse dwells severely on the fact that the majority of the\r\nAmericans on the _Crown Prince_ and the other hulks were not men who had\r\nbeen fairly taken in open combat on the high seas, but men who had been\r\nimpressed into the British Navy from American merchant ships previous to\r\nthe war between the two countries and who, upon the Declaration of War,\r\nhad given themselves up as prisoners of war, being naturally unwilling\r\nto fight against their own country, but who had been kept prisoners\r\ninstead of being exchanged. This had been the British practice since\r\n1755, but after the War of Independence it had ceased. All the same the\r\nBritish authorities had insisted upon the right of search for British\r\nsubjects on American ships, and to the arbitrary and forcible exercise\r\nof this ‘right’ was very largely owing the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse admits that on the whole he was treated as well on the _Crown\r\nPrince_ as were the British prisoners at Salem or Boston. Recruiting\r\nsergeants for the British service came on board and tried to tempt\r\nAmericans with a bounty of sixteen guineas, but they were only chaffed\r\nand sent off.\r\n\r\nLater on, 500 more prisoners arrived from America in a pitiable\r\ncondition, mostly Maryland and Pennsylvania men—‘Colonel Boerstler’s men\r\nwho had been deceived, decoyed and captured near Beaver Dams on January\r\n23rd, 1813’. With their cruel treatment on board the _Nemesis_ on their\r\ntrans-Atlantic voyage, Waterhouse contrasts favourably the kind\r\ntreatment of the prisoners brought by the _Poictiers 74_, Captain\r\nBeresford, after his capture of the American _Wasp_ and her prize the\r\n_Frolic_.\r\n\r\nThe author gives a glaring instance of provision cheating. By the terms\r\nof his contract, if the bread purveyor failed to send off to the hulks\r\nfresh bread when the weather was favourable, he forfeited half a pound\r\nof bread to each man. For a long time the prisoners were kept in\r\nignorance of this agreement, but they found it out, and on the next\r\noccasion when the forfeit was due, claimed it. Commodore Osmore refused\r\nit, and issued hard ship’s bread. The prisoners refused to take it.\r\nOsmore was furious, and ordered his marines to drive the prisoners, now\r\nin open mutiny, below. A disturbance was imminent, but the Americans\r\nremained firm, and the commodore gave way.\r\n\r\nThe American prisoners took in newspapers, as they were mostly\r\nintelligent and well-educated men, but paid dearly for them.\r\n\r\nThe papers were the _Statesman_, _Star_, _Bell’s Weekly Messenger_, and\r\n_Whig_. The _Statesman_ cost 28_s._ a month, plus 16_s._ a month for\r\nconveyance on board.\r\n\r\nAs the weather grew milder, matters were more comfortable on board until\r\nsmall-pox broke out. Vaccination was extensively employed, but many\r\nprisoners refused to submit to it, not from unbelief in its efficacy,\r\nbut from misery and unwillingness to live! Then came typhus, in April\r\n1814. There were 800 prisoners and 100 British on the ship. The hospital\r\nship being crowded, part of the _Crown Prince_ was set apart for\r\npatients, with the result that the mortality was very high. Still\r\nBeasley, the American agent, never came near the ship to inquire into\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe gambling evil had now assumed such proportions that the Americans\r\ndetermined to put it down. In spite of the vigorous opposition of the\r\nFrenchmen, the ‘wheels of fortune’ were abolished, but the\r\nbilliard-tables remained, it being urged by the Frenchmen that the rate\r\nof a halfpenny per game was not gambling, and that the game afforded a\r\ncertain amount of exercise. There remained, however, a strong\r\npro-gambling party among the Americans, and these men insisted upon\r\ncontinuing, and the committee sent one of them to the Black Hole without\r\na trial. This angered his mates; a meeting was held, violent speeches\r\nwere made in which the names of Hampden, Sidney, and Wilkes were\r\nintroduced, and he was brought out. He was no ordinary rough tar, but a\r\nrespectable well-educated New England yeoman, with the ‘gift of the\r\ngab’; and the results of his harangue were that the committee admitted\r\ntheir error, and he was released.\r\n\r\nFinally the billiard-tables were abolished; a great improvement was soon\r\nmanifest among the captives, education was fostered, and classes formed,\r\nalthough a few rough characters still held aloof, and preferred\r\nskylarking, and the slanging and chaffing of passers-by in boats on the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nIn May 1814 four men went on deck and offered themselves for British\r\nservice. Two got away, but two were caught by their mates, tried, and\r\nsentenced to be marked with indian ink on their foreheads with the\r\nletter T (= Traitor). The Frenchmen were now being shipped home. Some of\r\nthem had been prisoners since 1803. Waterhouse comments upon the\r\nappalling ignorance among English people in the educated class of all\r\nmatters American, and quotes the instance of the lady who, wishing to\r\nbuy some of the articles made by the American prisoners, was confronted\r\nby the difficulty of ‘not knowing their language’!\r\n\r\nWaterhouse describes the surroundings of the _Crown Prince_ thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Medway is a very pleasant river ... its banks are rich and\r\nbeautiful.... The picture from the banks of the river to the top of the\r\nlandscape is truly delightful, and beyond any thing I ever saw in my own\r\ncountry, and this is owing to the hedges.... Nearly opposite our doleful\r\nprison stands the village of Gillingham, adorned with a handsome church;\r\non the side next Chatham stands the castle, defended by more than an\r\nhundred cannon.... This place is noted for making sulphate of iron....\r\nNear to this village of Gillingham is a neat house with a good garden,\r\nand surrounded by trees, which was bequeathed by a lady to the oldest\r\nboatswain in the Royal Navy.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWaterhouse complains strongly of the immorality on board: ‘Such a sink\r\nof vice, I never saw, or ever dreamt of, as I have seen here,’ He\r\nrelates a daring escape. A hole was cut through the ship’s side near the\r\nstern, the copper being removed all round except on one side so as to\r\nlap over and be opened or closed at will. Sixteen men escaped through\r\nthis, and swam ashore one dark night, the sentry on duty close by being\r\nallured away by the singing of droll songs and the passing of a can of\r\ngrog. At the numbering of the prisoners next morning, the correct tale\r\nwas made up by the passing through a hole cut in the bulk-head of\r\nsixteen men who had been already counted. At another attempt two men\r\nslipped into the water; one of them got tired and benumbed with cold,\r\nand turned back. The sentry heard him breathing and said: ‘Ah! Here is a\r\nporpoise, and I’ll stick him with my bayonet,’ and only the crying out\r\nof the poor would-be refugee saved him. The ship’s officers on examining\r\nthe hole were amazed, and one of them remarked that he did not believe\r\nthat the Devil himself could keep these fellows in hell if they made up\r\ntheir minds to get out. The next day the other poor chap was seen lying\r\ndead on the beach, and to the disgust of the prisoners was allowed to\r\nremain there two days before he was buried.\r\n\r\nCommodore Osmore was always the butt of the American prisoners. A yarn\r\ngot about that he had procured a sheep from a farmer ashore without\r\npaying for it. Thereupon his appearance was the signal for a chorus of\r\n‘Baa! Baa!’ He was mad with rage, and ordered the port through which the\r\ninsulting chorus had been made to be closed. The Americans forced it\r\nopen. The marines drove the prisoners from the fo’c’sle into the\r\n‘Pound’. As more ‘Baa!’s resounded, they were driven below decks, and\r\nall market boats were stopped from approaching the ship, so that for two\r\ndays the prisoners were without extra food. However, Captain Hutchison\r\ninstituted an inquiry, and peace was arranged.\r\n\r\nIn June 1814 three men escaped in a water tank. Others would have\r\nfollowed, but one of the former party had stupidly written an ironical\r\nletter of thanks to Captain Hutchison, in which he described the method\r\nof escape.\r\n\r\nA daring escape was made from the _Irresistible_ in broad daylight. Four\r\nAmericans saw a jolly-boat made fast to the accommodation-ladder under\r\nthe charge of a sentry. One of them was a big, strong Indian of the\r\nNarragansett tribe from Rhode Island. The four men dashed down, seized\r\nthe sentry, disarmed him, threw him into the boat, and pulled off. They\r\nwere fired at from all sides, and boats put off from all the ships to\r\nchase them, but only one man was wounded. They reached shore and struck\r\nacross the fields, which were soon covered by people in chase from the\r\nfarms and brickfields, who soon ran all the prisoners down except the\r\nIndian, who out-distanced the prisoners, and would have got away had he\r\nnot sprained his ankle in getting over a fence, and even then, as he was\r\nsitting down, none of the country folk would approach him, until the\r\nmarines came up. The chase had been closely followed with great\r\nexcitement on the ship, and on the arrival of the captured men\r\nalongside, they were loudly cheered, their healths drunk, and the Indian\r\nat once dubbed ‘Baron Trenck’. Said the boys: ‘If it took 350 British\r\nseamen and marines to capture four Yankees, how many British sailors and\r\nmarines would it take to catch ten thousand of us?’\r\n\r\nTwo Scotsmen Waterhouse excepted from his condemnation of their nation:\r\nGalbraith, the master-at-arms, and Barnes, the sailing-master, who was\r\nwont to reprove them for misdeeds, saying: ‘I expect better things of\r\nyou as Americans, I consider you all in a different light from that of a\r\nd—d set of French monkeys.’\r\n\r\nThe British officers were clearly uneasy about their custody of the\r\nAmericans, and felt it to be an ignoble business. Said they: ‘The\r\nYankees seemed to take a pleasure in making us uneasy, and in exciting\r\nour apprehensions of their escape, and then they laugh and make\r\nthemselves merry at our anxiety. In fact, they have systematized the art\r\nof tormenting.’\r\n\r\nThe Government, too, appreciated ‘the difficult task which the miserable\r\nofficers of this miserable Medway fleet had to perform’. It did not wish\r\nthem to be more rigorous, yet knew that more rigour was necessary.\r\nRumours got about that in desperation the Government was about to\r\ntransfer all the Americans from the prison ships to Dartmoor—the place\r\nwhich, _it was said_, had been lost by the Duchess of Devonshire at a\r\ngame of hazard to the Prince of Wales, who determined to utilize it\r\nprofitably by making a prison there.\r\n\r\nThe national festival on July 4 was duly celebrated on board the two\r\nprison ships _Crown Prince_ and _Nassau_. An additional allowance of\r\ndrink was sanctioned, but the American flag was only allowed to be flown\r\nas high as the ‘railings’. There were drums and pipes which played\r\nYankee Doodle on the fo’c’sle: cheers were exchanged between the ships,\r\nand the toast of the day was drunk in English porter. There was, of\r\ncourse, much speechifying, especially on the _Nassau_, where one orator\r\ndeclaimed for half an hour, and another recited a poem, ‘The Impressment\r\nof an American Sailor Boy’, which is too long to be quoted, but which,\r\nsays our author, brought tears into many eyes. All passed off quietly,\r\nand acknowledgement is made of the ‘extraordinary good behaviour of all\r\nthe British officers and men on board the _Crown Prince_‘.\r\n\r\nAlthough Commodore Osmore was unpopular with the Americans, his charming\r\nwife exercised a good influence in the ship by her amiability and\r\nappreciation of the fact that American prisoners were not all a gang of\r\nvagabonds; and gradually a better feeling developed between captors and\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nIn August 1814 the news of the transfer to Dartmoor was confirmed, and,\r\nsays Waterhouse, was received with regret on the _Crown Prince_—the ship\r\nbeing ‘actually viewed with feelings of attachment’. The last scene,\r\nhowever, was marked by a disturbance.\r\n\r\nThirty prisoners had been told off to prepare for embarkation on a\r\ntender. At the appointed hour no tender appeared, and the embarkation\r\nwas put off. But all hammocks had been packed, and upon application to\r\nOsmore for hammocks, the prisoners were told to shift as they could for\r\nthe night, as the tender would arrive early the next morning, and it was\r\nnot worth while to unpack the hammocks. Upon hearing this the prisoners\r\nresolved that if they were to be deprived of their night’s rest, nobody\r\nelse should have any. So they harnessed themselves to benches, and ran\r\nabout the deck, shouting and singing, and bumping the benches against\r\neverything which would make a noise, jammed down the marines’ crockery\r\nand brought into play every article which could add to the pandemonium.\r\nOsmore sent a marine down to quiet them. The marine returned,\r\ndishevelled, and disarmed. Osmore was furious. ‘I’ll be d—d if I do not\r\nfire on them!’ he roared: ‘Fire, and be d—d,’ was the response. As it\r\nwas useless to attempt to quiet them, and to fire would have been\r\ncriminal, the commodore retired, and did what he could to sleep amid the\r\ninfernal din of bumping benches, jangling metal, shouts and songs, which\r\nlasted throughout the night.\r\n\r\nWhen the tender took the men off in the morning it was to the\r\naccompaniment of a great roar of ‘Baa! Baa!’ as a parting shot.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the _Crown Prince_ Americans were transferred to the\r\n_Bahama_ on October 15, 1814. Here they found 300 of their countrymen of\r\nthe vicious, baser sort, gamblers all, and without any men of influence\r\nto order them. Danes occupied the main deck and Americans the lower.\r\nJail fever had played havoc among Danes and Americans—no less than 84 of\r\nthe latter being buried in the marshes in three months.\r\n\r\nNext to the _Bahama_ lay the _Belliqueux_ hulk, full of harmless and\r\ndull Scandinavians, so that the captain thereof, having nothing to do in\r\nhis own ship, started to spy upon the doings aboard the _Bahama_, and\r\nsucceeded in getting a marine punished for smuggling liquor. Next day,\r\nthe rations were fish and potatoes. The Americans collected all their\r\npotatoes, and watched for the appearance of the _Belliqueux_ commander\r\nfor his spying promenade on his quarter deck, the result being that when\r\nhe did appear, he was greeted with such a hail of potatoes that he was\r\nfain to beat an undignified retreat. Soon he came off in his boat to\r\ncomplain to Commander Wilson of the _Bahama_ of his treatment. Wilson, a\r\npassionate, hot-tempered, but just and humane man, said he was very\r\nsorry, but could do nothing, so back the discomfited officer had to go,\r\npelted with more potatoes and some coals. Said Wilson: ‘These Americans\r\nare the sauciest dogs I ever saw; but d—n me if I can help liking them,\r\nnor can I ever hate men who are so much like ourselves.’\r\n\r\nIn October 1814 two hundred Americans were sent to Plymouth, where they\r\nwere at once boarded by an army of loose women.\r\n\r\nWith Waterhouse’s experiences at Dartmoor I deal in the chapter devoted\r\nto that prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                          PRISON-SHIP SUNDRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this heading are included various reminiscences of, and\r\nparticulars about, the prison ships which could not be conveniently\r\ndealt with in the foregoing chapters.\r\n\r\nIn April 1759 five French prisoners from the _Royal Oak_ hulk at\r\nPlymouth were executed at Exeter for the murder of Jean Maneaux, who had\r\ninformed the agent that his comrades had forged passports in order to\r\nfacilitate their escape to France. Finding this out, they got Maneaux\r\ninto an obscure corner of the ship, tied him to a ringbolt, and gave him\r\nsixty lashes with a rope to the end of which was fastened an iron\r\nthimble as thick as a man’s wrist. He got loose, and fell back; they\r\njumped on him till they broke his neck, then cut his body into small\r\npieces, and conveyed them through a waste pipe overboard. The next day\r\ntwenty-seven prisoners were arrested, and one of them pointed out the\r\nactual murderers.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 two prisoners escaped from the _San Rafael_ at Plymouth, swam\r\noff to a lighter full of powder, overpowered the man in charge, ran down\r\nthrough all the ships in Hamoaze, round Drake’s Island, and got safely\r\naway to France, where they sold the powder at a handsome price.\r\n\r\nEven more daring was the deed of eleven Frenchmen who, early in the\r\nmorning of April 7, 1808, made their escape from the hulk _Vigilant_ at\r\nPortsmouth, by cutting a hole, and swimming to the _Amphitrite_, a ship\r\nin ordinary, fitted up as the abode of the Superintendent Master. They\r\nboarded a boat, hanging on the davits, clothed themselves in the\r\ngreatcoats of the boat’s crew, lowered her, and in the semi-darkness\r\npulled away to the Master Attendant’s buoy boat, one of the finest\r\nunarmed crafts in the harbour, valued at £1,000. They boarded her,\r\nimmediately got under way at about five a.m., and successfully navigated\r\nher to Havre, or Cherbourg, which they reached in the evening, and sold\r\nher for £700. She was fitted out, armed with eight six-pounders, and\r\nwent forth as a privateer under the name of _Le Buoy Boat de\r\nPortsmouth_. Her career, however, was short, for in November she was\r\ncaptured by the _Coquette_.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned prison ship _Vigilant_ seems to have hardly deserved\r\nher name, for in the year 1810 alone no less than thirty-two prisoners\r\nescaped from her, and of these only eight were recaptured.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion three prisoners escaped from a hulk, got a small\r\nskiff, rowed to Yantlett Creek, where they boarded a fishing-smack of\r\nwhich the master and boy were asleep. The master made a stout resistance\r\nand called on the boy to help him, but he was too terrified to do so.\r\nThe master was overpowered and severely beaten, and then managed to jump\r\noverboard. The Frenchmen got off, taking the boy with them.\r\n\r\nThe _Sampson_ at Chatham was evidently an ill-omened ship. It was on\r\nboard her that occurred the disastrous event of May 31, 1811, when the\r\nhalf-starved prisoners, upon being docked of half their rations for the\r\nmisdeeds of a few of their number, broke out into open mutiny, which was\r\nonly quelled at the cost of six prisoners being killed and a great many\r\nwounded. On the _Sampson_, also, was fought a particularly terrible duel\r\nin 1812. Two prisoners quarrelled and determined to settle their\r\ndifference quietly. So, attended only by their seconds, they betook\r\nthemselves to the ordinary ship prison, which happened to be empty, and,\r\narmed with sticks to which scissor-blades had been fastened, fought. One\r\nof them received a mortal thrust in the abdomen, but, although his\r\nbowels were protruding, he continued to parry his opponent’s blows until\r\nhe was exhausted. He died in spite of the surgeon’s attentions.\r\n\r\nOn board the same ship in 1813, three prisoners decided to murder the\r\nmaster’s mate and the sergeant of marines—men universally detested for\r\ntheir brutal behaviour—and drew lots as to who should do it. The lot\r\nfell upon Charles Manseraux. But he had ‘compunction of conscience’\r\nbecause the sergeant was a married man with a family. However, he had to\r\nkill some one, and fixed on a private of the Marines. He took the\r\nopportunity when the unfortunate man was doing duty on the fo’c’sle and\r\ndrove a knife into his back. Another prisoner saw the deed done, knocked\r\nManseraux down and secured him. Manseraux and the others were tried at\r\nthe Maidstone Assizes, found guilty, and executed.\r\n\r\nDuelling and crimes of violence seem to have been rampant on certain\r\nships more than on others. The _San Damaso_ at Portsmouth was one of\r\nthese, although on the Chatham hulks the unnatural deaths were so\r\nfrequent that the Coroner of Rochester in 1812 claimed special fees from\r\nthe Transport Office on account of the trebling of his duties, a claim\r\nwhich was not granted.\r\n\r\nA very bold attempt at escape in broad daylight was made by some\r\ndesperate prisoners of the _Canada_ hulk at Chatham in 1812. Beef was\r\nbeing hoisted on board the prison ship from a lighter alongside, on\r\nboard of which were half a dozen American prisoners who were assisting\r\nin the operation. Suddenly, they cut the painter, and, helped by a stiff\r\nbreeze, actually sailed off, and, although the guards on all the prison\r\nships fired at them, would have escaped if they had not run aground off\r\nCommodore’s Hard, Gillingham. They sprang ashore here, and ran, but the\r\nmud was too much for them and they were captured.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, whether ashore or afloat, were the hardest prisoners to\r\nguard of any. They seem never to have relaxed in their plans and\r\nattempts to escape, and as they were invariably better supplied with\r\nmoney than Frenchmen and Spaniards, they could add the power of the\r\nbribe to the power which knowledge of their captors’ language gave them.\r\nHence no estimate can be formed of the real number of Americans who got\r\naway from the hulks, for, although a very exact system of roll call was\r\nin use, the ingenuity of the Americans, immensely backed by their\r\npurses, contrived matters so that not merely were the numbers on board\r\nalways complete at each roll call, but upon more than one occasion, by\r\nsome over-exercise of ingenuity, the captain of a hulk actually found\r\nhimself commanding more prisoners than there were!\r\n\r\nBy way of relief to the monotony of this _guerre à outrance_ between\r\ncaptors and captives we may quote instances when the better humanity of\r\nthe hapless ones came to the fore.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 a prisoner made an attempt to set the hulk _Ganges_ on fire at\r\nPlymouth, and a large hole was burned in her side. The other prisoners\r\nhelped to extinguish the flames, and were so angry with the incendiary\r\nthat they were with difficulty prevented from tearing him to pieces.\r\n\r\nThree officers of the Inverness Militia were sailing in the harbour at\r\nPortsmouth in the same year, when a squall upset their boat, and they\r\nwere thrown into the water. One of the officers could not swim, and\r\nseeing him struggling for life, a French prisoner on the _Crown_ hulk at\r\nonce sprang overboard and brought him safely to the ship. He was at once\r\nliberated and returned to France.\r\n\r\nBut even heroism became a cloak for trickery among these weary,\r\nhopeless, desperate exiles ever on the watch for a chance of escaping.\r\nIn 1810 a French prisoner at Plymouth obtained his freedom by saving a\r\nBritish sentry from drowning, but the number of British sentries who,\r\nafter this, met with accidents which tumbled them overboard, and the\r\nunfailing regularity with which heroic prisoner-rescuers appeared on the\r\nscene, awakened the suspicions of the authorities, who found out that\r\nthese occurrences were purely commercial transactions. So they stopped\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nIt is equally pleasing to come across, in this continually dreary record\r\nof crime and misery, a foreign testimony to English kindness. The\r\nfollowing letter was kindly lent to me by Mr. J. E. Mace, of Tenterden,\r\nKent, to whose grandfather it was addressed:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          ‘Chatham. Le 10 janvier, 1798.\r\n\r\n ‘_A Monsieur Mace, Tenterden._\r\n\r\n ‘CHER MONSIEUR:\r\n\r\n‘S’il est cruel d’être livré aux dégoûts et aux peines que cause la\r\ncaptivité la plus dure, il est bien doux de trouver des êtres sensibles\r\nqui, comme vous, cher Monsieur, savent plaindre le sort rigoureux des\r\nvictimes de la guerre. Ce que vous avez eu la bonté de m’envoyer, plus\r\nencore, l’expression des beaux sentiments me touche, me pénètre de la\r\nplus vive reconnaissance, et me fait sentir avec une nouvelle force\r\ncette vérité constante:—L’Humanité rapproche et unit tous les cœurs\r\nfaits pour elle. Comme vous, cher Monsieur, et avec vous, je désire avec\r\nferveur que les principes de notre Divin Législateur reprennent leur\r\nEmpire sur la terre, la conséquence en est si belle!\r\n\r\n                         ‘Dieu vous garde beaucoup d’années.\r\n                                 ‘FARBOURIET, Colonel 12^{me} Hussards.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1807, as a consequence of the bombardment of Copenhagen and the\r\nsubsequent surrender to England of the Danish fleet, there were 1,840\r\nDanish prisoners in England, who received double the allowance of French\r\nprisoners, inasmuch as they were rather hostages than prisoners—hostages\r\nfor the good behaviour of Denmark as regards Napoleon;—the captain of a\r\nman-of-war got four shillings per diem, a commanding officer two\r\nshillings, the captain of an Indiaman three shillings, and so on. In\r\nother respects they were treated as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nThese Danes were largely taken from the hulks to man our merchant navy,\r\nand one Wipperman, a Danish clerk on H.M.S. _Utile_, seems to have made\r\nthis transfer business a very profitable one, until the accusation\r\nbrought against him by a Danish prisoner of war of having obtained a\r\nwatch and some money under false pretences, brought to light the fact\r\nthat his men rarely if ever joined the British merchant service except\r\nto desert at the first opportunity, and generally went at large as free\r\nmen. He was severely punished, and his exposure brought to an end an\r\nextensive crimping system by which hundreds of dangerous foreigners had\r\nbeen let loose from the prison ships, many of them spies and\r\nescape-aiders.\r\n\r\nForeign writers have included among their various complaints against the\r\nBritish Government its reluctance to allow religious ministration among\r\nthe prisoners of war. But the Transport Office, as we shall see later,\r\nhad learned by experience that the garb of sanctity was by no means\r\nalways the guarantee of sanctity, and so when in 1808 a Danish parson\r\napplied to be allowed on the prison ships at Chatham, he got his\r\npermission only on the condition that ‘he does not repeat, the old\r\noffence of talking upon matters unconnected with his mission and so\r\ncause much incorrect inferences’—a vague expression which probably meant\r\ntalking about outside affairs to prisoners, who had no other source of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 the Transport Office replied to the Bishop of Angoulême, who\r\nrequested that a priest named Paucheron might minister on the prison\r\nships at Chatham, that they could not accede inasmuch as Paucheron had\r\nbeen guilty ‘of highly improper conduct in solemnizing a marriage\r\nbetween a prisoner of war and a woman in disguise of a man’.\r\n\r\nIn no branch of art did French prisoners show themselves more proficient\r\nthan in that of forgery, and, although when we come to treat of the\r\nprisons ashore we shall find that, from the easier accessibility to\r\nimplements there, the imitation of passports and bank notes was more\r\nperfectly effected than by the prisoners on the hulks, the latter were\r\nnot always unsuccessful in their attempts.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Guiller and Collas, two prisoners on _El Firme_ at Plymouth,\r\nopened negotiations with the captain’s clerk to get exchanged to the\r\n_Généreux_, telling him what their object was and promising a good\r\nreward. He pretended to entertain their proposals, but privately told\r\nthe captain. Their exchange was effected, and their ally supplied them\r\nwith paper, ink, and pencils of fine hair, with which they imitated\r\nnotes of the Bank of England, the Naval and Commercial Bank, and an\r\nOkehampton Bank. Not having the official perforated stamp, they copied\r\nit to perfection by means of smooth halfpennies and sail-makers’\r\nneedles. When all was ready, the clerk gave the word to the authorities,\r\nand the clever rascals got their reward on the gallows at Exeter in\r\n1810, being among the first war prisoners to be executed for forgery.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 two French prisoners on a Portsmouth hulk, Dubois and Benry,\r\nwere condemned to be hanged at Winchester for the forgery of a £1 Bank\r\nof England note. Whilst lying in the jail there they tried to take their\r\nown lives by opening veins in their arm with broken glass and enlarging\r\nthe wounds with rusty nails, declaring that they would die as soldiers,\r\nnot as dogs, and were only prevented by force from carrying out their\r\nresolve. They died crying ‘Vive l’Empereur!’\r\n\r\nIn 1814 six officers were found to have obtained their liberty by forged\r\npassports. These men were, in their own vernacular, ‘Broke-Paroles’—men\r\nwho had been sent from parole places to prison ships, for the crime of\r\nforging passports. Further investigation caused suspicion to be fixed\r\nupon a woman calling herself Madame Carpenter, who was ostensibly a tea\r\nand sugar dealer at 46 Foley Street, Portland Chapel, London, but who\r\nhad gained some influence at the Transport Office through having\r\nrendered services to British prisoners in France, which enabled her to\r\nhave access to the prison ships in her pretended trade, although she was\r\na Frenchwoman. I cannot discover what punishment she received. We shall\r\nhear more of her in the chapter upon Stapleton Prison.\r\n\r\nA clever quibble saved the life of a prisoner on the _San Rafael_ hulk\r\nat Plymouth. He was tried at Exeter for imitating a £2 note with indian\r\nink, but pleaded that as he was under the protection of no laws he had\r\nnot broken any, and was acquitted. This was before cases of murder and\r\nforgery were brought under the civil jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWell-deserved releases of prisoners in recognition of good actions done\r\nby them in the past were not rare. In 1808 a prisoner on the _Sampson_\r\nat Chatham, named Sabatier, was released without exchange on the\r\nrepresentation of the London Missionary Society, who acted for Captain\r\nCarbonel of the famous privateer _Grand Bonaparte_, who had shown great\r\nkindness to the crew and passengers of the ship _Duff_ which he had\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nIn the same year a prisoner at Plymouth, named Verdie, was released\r\nunconditionally on the petition of Lieut. Ross, R.N., for having kindly\r\ntreated the Lieutenant’s father when the latter was a prisoner in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 a Portsmouth prisoner was unconditionally liberated upon his\r\nproving satisfactorily that he had helped Midshipman Holgate of the\r\n_Shannon_ to escape from imprisonment in France.\r\n\r\nAlmost to the very last the care of sick prisoners on the hulks seems to\r\nhave been criminally neglected. For instance, the In-letters to the\r\nTransport Office during the year 1810 are full of vehement or pathetic\r\ncomplaints about the miserable state of the sick on the _Marengo_ and\r\n_Princess Sophia_ hospital ships at Portsmouth. Partly this may be due\r\nto an economical craze which affected the authorities at this time, but\r\nit must be chiefly attributed to medical inefficiency and neglect. Most\r\nof the chief medical officers of the prison ships had their own private\r\npractices ashore, with what results to the poor foreigners, nominally\r\ntheir sole care, can be imagined, and all of them resented the very\r\nnecessary condition that they should sleep on the ships.\r\n\r\nIn this year 1810, Dr. Kirkwood, of the _Europe_ hospital ship at\r\nPlymouth, was convicted of culpable neglect in regularly sleeping\r\nashore, and was superseded. As a result of an inquiry into the causes of\r\nabnormal sickness on the _Vigilant_ and at Forton Prison, Portsmouth,\r\nthe surgeons were all superseded, and the order was issued that all\r\nprison-ship surgeons should daily examine the healthy prisoners so as to\r\ncheck incipient sickness. I append the States of the _Renown_ hospital\r\nship at Plymouth for February 1814:\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘Staff:  2 surgeons, 1 assistant surgeon, 1 matron, 1 interpreter, 1\r\n            cook, 1 barber, 1 mattress maker, 1 tailor, 1 washerwoman,\r\n            and 10 nurses.\r\n\r\n          Received 141. Discharged 69. Died 19. Remaining 53.\r\n\r\n‘Fever and dysentery have been the prevalent complaints among the\r\nprisoners from Pampelune, whose deplorable state the Board of Inspection\r\nare in full possession of. (Among these were some forty women “in so\r\nwretched a state that they were wholly destitute of the appropriate\r\ndress of their sex”. Two of the British officers’ wives collected money\r\nfor the poor creatures and clothed them.) Pneumonia has recently\r\nattacked many of these ill-conditioned men termed _Romans_, many of whom\r\nwere sent here literally in a state of nudity, an old hammock in the\r\nboat to cover them being excepted.’\r\n\r\n\r\n(The _Romans_ above mentioned were the most degraded and reckless of the\r\nDartmoor prisoners, who had been sent to the hulks partly because there\r\nwas no power in the prison that could keep them in order, and partly\r\nbecause their filthy and vicious habits were revolting to the other and\r\nmore decent prisoners.)\r\n\r\nThe horrors of the English prison ships were constantly quoted by French\r\ncommanders as spurs to the exertions of their men. Bonaparte more than\r\nonce dwelt on them. Phillipon, the gallant defender of Badajos,\r\nafterwards a prisoner on parole in England, reminded his men of them as\r\nthey crowded to hurl our regiments from the breaches. ‘An appeal’, says\r\nNapier, ‘deeply felt, for the annals of civilized nations furnish\r\nnothing more inhuman towards captives of war than the prison ships of\r\nEngland.’\r\n\r\nThe accompanying drawing from Colonel Lebertre’s book may give some idea\r\nof the packing process practised on the hulks. It represents a view from\r\nabove of the orlop deck of the _Brunswick_ prison ship at Chatham—a ship\r\nwhich was regarded as rather a good one to be sent to. The length of\r\nthis deck was 125 feet, its breadth 40 feet in the widest part, and its\r\nheight 4 feet 10 inches, so that only boys could pass along it without\r\nstooping. Within this space 460 persons slept, and as there was only\r\nspace to swing 431 hammocks, 29 men had to sleep as best they could\r\nbeneath the others.\r\n\r\nSomething with an element of fun in it may serve as a relief to the\r\nprevalent gloom of this chapter. It has been shown how largely gambling\r\nentered into the daily life of the poor wretches on the hulks, and how\r\nevery device and excuse for it were invented and employed, but the\r\ninstance given by Captain Harris in his book upon Dartmoor is one of the\r\noddest.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘When the lights were extinguished’, he says, ‘and the ship’s lantern\r\nalone cast a dim glimmer through the long room, the rats were accustomed\r\nto show themselves in search of the rare crumbs to be found below the\r\nhammocks. A specially tempting morsel having been placed on an open\r\nspace, the arrival of the performers was anxiously looked for. They were\r\nall known by name, and thus each player was able to select his champion\r\nfor the evening. As soon as a certain number had gained the open space,\r\na sudden whistle, given by a disinterested spectator, sent them back to\r\ntheir holes, and the first to reach his hole was declared the winner. An\r\nold grey rat called “Père Ratapon” was a great favourite with the\r\ngamblers, for, though not so active as his younger brethren, he was\r\nalways on the alert to secure a good start when disturbed.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn justice to our ancient foe I give here a couple of extracts, for\r\nwhich I have to thank Mr. Gates of Portsmouth, from the _Hampshire\r\nTelegraph_, illustrative of generous behaviour towards Englishmen who\r\nhad been forced to aid prisoners to escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ORLOP DECK OF _BRUNSWICK_ PRISON SHIP, CHATHAM.\r\n\r\n  (_After Colonel Lebertre._)\r\n\r\n  Length, 125 feet.

In a cartel vessel which arrived last week from\r\nFrance, came over one Stephen Buckle, a waterman of this town. Three\r\ngentlemen had hired this waterman to take them to the Isle of Wight, and\r\nthey had not proceeded farther than Calshot Castle when they rose upon\r\nhim, gagged him, tied him hand and foot, and threatened him with instant\r\ndeath if he made the slightest noise or resistance. The boatman begged\r\nfor mercy, and promised his assistance in any undertaking if they would\r\nspare his life; on which he was released, and was told they were French\r\nprisoners, and ordered to make for the nearest port in France, at his\r\nperil. The darkness of the night, and the calmness of the wind, favoured\r\ntheir intentions, for after rowing two days and nights in a small, open\r\nskiff, without having the least sustenance, they arrived safe at\r\nCherbourg. The waterman was interrogated at the Custom House as to the\r\nprisoners’ escape; when, after giving the particulars and identifying\r\nthe persons, saying they threatened to murder him, the officers took the\r\nthree Frenchmen into custody, to take their respective trials. The poor\r\nman’s case being made known to the Government, he was ordered to be\r\nliberated, and his boat restored.’\r\n\r\n\r\n‘September 21st, 1807. Between 9 and 10 o’clock on the evening of last\r\nSunday three weeks, two men engaged Thomas Hart, a ferryman, to take\r\nthem from Gosport beach to Spithead, to go on board a ship there, as\r\nthey said. When the boat reached Spithead they pretended the ship had\r\ngone to St. Helens, and requested the waterman to go out after her.\r\nHaving reached that place, one of them, who could speak English, took a\r\ndagger from under his coat, and swore he would take the life of the\r\nwaterman if he did not land them in France.\r\n\r\n‘Under this threat the man consented to follow their directions, and\r\nlanded them at Fécamp. The men appeared to be in the uniform of officers\r\nof the British Navy. The waterman was lodged in prison at Havre de\r\nGrâce, and kept there for ten days. He was then released on representing\r\nhimself to be a fisherman, his boat was returned to him, and the\r\nFrenchmen gave him six or seven pounds of bread, some cyder, and a\r\npocket compass, and a pass to prevent his being interrupted by any\r\nFrench vessel he might meet with. In this state they set him adrift; he\r\nbrought several letters from English prisoners in France, and from\r\nFrench persons to their friends in prison in this country.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                              TOM SOUVILLE\r\n                      A FAMOUS PRISON-SHIP ESCAPER\r\n\r\nIn old Calais there is or was a _Rue Tom Souville_. No foreigners and\r\nnot many Calaisiens know who Tom Souville was, or what he had done to\r\ndeserve to have a street named after him. The answer to these questions\r\nis so interesting that I do not hesitate to allow it a chapter.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1785, Tom Souville, aged nine, was, in accordance with a\r\nfrequent custom of that day, sent to England for the purpose of learning\r\nEnglish in exchange for a little English boy who came over to France. He\r\nwas quartered in the house of the Rev. Mr. Wood, of Dover, whose sailor\r\nbrother took a great fancy to the little stranger, and made him his\r\nconstant companion on cruises up and down the Channel, with the result\r\nthat Tom Souville got to know the Channel coasts thoroughly, a stock of\r\nlearning which he afterwards made use of in a fashion little dreamed of\r\nby the old salt, his mentor.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas 1786, after eighteen months’ happiness at Dover, he\r\nreturned to Calais, and in obedience to his irresistible bent, joined\r\nthe navy. In 1795, the _Formidable_, with Tom Souville on board, was\r\ntaken by H.M.S. _Queen Charlotte_, off Isle-Croix, after a fight in\r\nwhich she lost 320 killed and wounded out of her complement of 717, and\r\nTom with his Captain, Linois, of whom mention will be made later in this\r\nwork, were taken to Portsmouth. Tom Souville refused to sign a parole\r\nform, so was put into the _cachot_ of the _Diamond_ hulk; but only for a\r\nshort time, as he was soon exchanged. However, in 1797 he was again\r\ncaptured, this time on the _Actif_, and was confined on the _Crown_\r\nhulk.\r\n\r\nOf life on the _Crown_ he gives the usual description. He speaks of the\r\nprisoner professors (who were known as the ‘Académiciens’) being obliged\r\nto give their lessons at night, as the noise during the daytime made\r\nteaching impossible. But as no lights were allowed ‘tween decks after a\r\ncertain hour, they saved up the fat of their ration meat, and put it\r\ninto an oyster-shell with a wick of cotton threads, fencing it round\r\nwith clothes. Sometimes the air was so foul that the light went out. If\r\nthey were discovered, the guards destroyed everything, books, paper,\r\nslates, pens, &c.\r\n\r\nSouville mentions one thing I have not noticed in any account of\r\nprison-ship life, that there were French women on board, ‘de basse\r\nextraction et extrêmement grossières’.\r\n\r\nHe emphasizes the incapacity and brutality of the British doctors, and\r\nparticularizes one Weiss (not a British name, one is thankful to note!)\r\nas a type. He says that the orthodox treatment of the prisoners from San\r\nDomingo, who were suffering from the _vomito negro_, was to plunge them\r\ninto icy water!\r\n\r\nA system of signalling and holding conversation between one prison ship\r\nand another was carried out by the carpenters, who had their benches on\r\nthe upper deck, a regular alphabet being arranged by means of hammer\r\nknocks and shifting the position of the benches. He is the first also to\r\nmention that theatricals were performed on a prison ship; the pieces\r\ngiven being a two-act vaudeville, _Les Aventures d’une voyageuse\r\nsensible_, and a drama in five acts, _La Fiancée du Corsaire_. The\r\norchestra consisted of a flute and a violin; the female dresses were\r\nlent by the ladies of Portsmouth and Gosport, who also came as\r\nspectators. But the chief amusement, he says, was to vex the authorities\r\nas much as possible, to call the captain, who had an inflated sense of\r\nhis own importance, a mere turnkey, to make songs on him, and above all\r\nto play tricks at the roll call, so as to create confusion and\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to escape were very frequent, and this in spite of a recent\r\nsavage threat that for every prisoner who escaped two should be hanged.\r\nSouville describes a daring escape which inspired him to action. A\r\ncutter laden with powder was alongside one of the hulks, waiting for\r\nmorning to discharge into the _Egmont_ man-of-war. Lieutenant Larivière\r\nand four or five other prisoners managed to slip out of the _Crown_ and\r\nboard her. They found the crew fast asleep, tied and gagged them\r\nsecurely, and adopted their clothes. At daybreak they hoisted their\r\nsail, Larivière giving loud commands in English, and passed by the\r\n_Egmont_, waiting for her powder. She hailed them to stop, but they\r\ncrowded on all sail, and although the alarm was signalled, and they were\r\npursued, they crossed safely to Roscoff.\r\n\r\nAs Souville, when he refused to be put on parole, had openly declared\r\nthat he would escape at the first opportunity, he was carefully guarded.\r\nThanks to his excellent knowledge of English he made friends among the\r\nbluejackets of the guard, and especially with one Will, whom he had\r\nhelped with money when his mother’s home was threatened to be broken up\r\nfor debt.\r\n\r\nSo he started the delicate and difficult operation of boring a hole in\r\nthe ship’s side, large enough to admit the passage of a human body,\r\nabove the water line, yet not too near the grated platform running round\r\nthe ship, continually patrolled by guards. He counted on Will’s aid, and\r\nconfided his scheme to him.\r\n\r\nThe very next morning he was conducted to the Black Hole, and was\r\ninformed that his design had been betrayed, and he instantly guessed\r\nthat his supposed friend Will was the betrayer, as he alone was in the\r\nsecret. Whilst in the _cachot_ he found a mysterious note merely saying\r\nthat at a certain hour on a certain day the high tide would be over the\r\nmud-banks which had proved fatal to so many fugitives from the hulks. In\r\nthe _cachot_ with him were three men who had successfully shammed\r\nmadness in order to get sent to France, and who were about to be\r\nliberated. One of them, whose form of assumed madness had been to crow\r\nday and night like a cock, gave Tom a clue to a hole he had commenced to\r\nbore in the event of his sham madness failing.\r\n\r\nSouville found the hole, finished it, and on the date named in the note\r\nslipped out, and started for a three-mile swim towards a light ashore.\r\nAfter much labour, he negotiated the mud-banks, and landed. Exhausted,\r\nhe fell asleep, and was awakened by a man. He sprang to his feet and\r\nprepared to defend himself from arrest; but the man impressed silence,\r\nand pointed to a fisher-hut whence a light shone, evidently that to\r\nwhich he had steered at first, but of which he had lost sight during his\r\nlong struggle in the water.\r\n\r\nHe entered the hut and found Will! The whole affair, the arrest, the\r\n_cachot_, and the mysterious note turned out to be Will’s plot, who\r\nexplained that if he had not divulged the secret of Souville’s first\r\nescape-hole when it was known that he had discovered it, he would\r\nprobably have got a thousand lashes at the triangles, and that to atone\r\nfor it he had conveyed to the _cachot_ the note which was the means of\r\nTom’s escape.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in completely disguising him, and he started. As he\r\npassed along the smuggler’s cliff path he heard the guns which\r\nproclaimed the escape of a prisoner. At 9 a.m. he passed Kingston, and\r\ngot to Farlington on the Chichester road. Here he put up at a lodging\r\nhouse, replying to suspicious inquiries that he was from London, bound\r\nfor an American ship coming from Dover. From here he took coach to\r\nBrighton, and in two days was at Dover. At Dover he waited two more days\r\nbefore he could find a neutral ship to take him across, and then quietly\r\nsmuggled himself on to a Danish brig bound for Calais, and hid under a\r\ncoil of rope on deck. Whilst here the Admiralty people came on board to\r\nsearch for fugitives, and one of them actually sat on the heap of rope\r\nunder which he was. The brig sailed, and then, to the astonishment of\r\nthe master and crew, Tom presented himself. At first the master was\r\ndisposed to put back and give Tom up, for the penalties were heavy for\r\nharbouring escaped prisoners, but the promise of a handsome reward and\r\nTom’s mention of influential friends overcame his scruples and Tom was\r\nsafely landed.\r\n\r\nHe went home, got the money, of which he gave 1,000 francs to the\r\nskipper, 500 francs to the crew, and 500 to the fisherman who landed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSouville now started the privateering business which was to make him\r\nfamous, and during the years 1806 and 1807 won for his _Glaneur_ a\r\nreputation on both sides of the Channel. At Dunkirk he distinguished\r\nhimself on shore by saving two lives from a runaway carriage which had\r\nbeen upset into the port. He then changed to the _Général Paris_, and\r\nmade a number of rich captures, but on November 30, 1808, was captured\r\noff Folkestone by two corvettes and a cutter, and found himself on the\r\n_Assistance_ prison ship at Portsmouth. On the _Assistance_ he made so\r\nmany attempts to escape that he was changed to the _Crown_. Here he met\r\nan old shipmate, Captain Havas, of the _Furet_ privateer, but from\r\npolicy they agreed not to let it be seen that they were friends, and\r\nthey lost no time in setting to work with saws made of barrel-hoops, and\r\nbits of fencing foils for gimlets, to make a hole a square foot in size\r\nthrough the nine inches of the wooden ship’s side, and, to avoid the\r\nnoise they made being heard, they worked while the English soldiers were\r\nscrubbing the decks.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of January 1809 the hole was ready. January 9 was a\r\nsuitable day for this project, being foggy, and the only obstacle was\r\nthe bitter cold of the water. They had saved up rum, and grease\r\nwherewith to rub themselves, and had a compass, a knife, a flask for the\r\nrum, and a waterproof fishing-basket to hold a change of clothes. At\r\nmidnight they opened the hole; Havas slipped out, and Souville followed,\r\nbut in doing so made a slight noise, but enough to attract the notice of\r\nthe sentry. They swam away amidst a storm of bullets fired at random in\r\nthe fog and darkness. Souville was soon caught by one of the boats which\r\nat the first alarm had put out from all the hulks. Havas hung on to the\r\nrudder of a Portuguese ship under repair, and paused to rest. When all\r\nwas quiet, he climbed up, boarded the ship, crept down to the hold, got\r\nunder a basket, and, utterly worn out, fell asleep.\r\n\r\nA cabin boy coming for the basket in the morning, at the appearance of a\r\nstrange man under it was terrified and cried out. Havas rushed up on\r\ndeck, but at the mouth of the hatchway was met by an English soldier who\r\npromptly knocked him down, and he was secured.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers got a month’s Black Hole, and when they were released\r\nfound the precautions against escape were stricter than ever. In May\r\n1809 the news came that all the prisoners taken at Guadeloupe were to be\r\nexchanged. Havas and Souville determined to profit by the opportunity,\r\nand bought two turns of exchange from soldiers, with the idea of getting\r\naway as Guadeloupe prisoners. But, in order to pass the sentry it was\r\nnecessary that they should have the appearance of having served in the\r\ntropics, so they had ‘to make themselves up’, with false moustaches and\r\nstained faces. This was effected, and at the signal of departure the two\r\nadventurers joined the Guadeloupe contingent and were taken ashore. But\r\non the jetty stood Captain Ross, of the _Crown_, scrutinizing the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n‘You didn’t expect me here, my man,’ said he to Havas, at the same time\r\ntaking hold of his moustache, which came off in his hand. ‘Never mind;\r\nalthough I am in duty bound to take you before Commodore Woodriff, I’ll\r\nask him to let you off; if I don’t you’ll sink my ship with your eternal\r\nhole-boring through her!’\r\n\r\nHe meant what he said, for, although somewhat of a martinet (so says the\r\nbiographer of Souville—Henri Chevalier), he was a good fellow at heart,\r\nbut Woodriff, who had been in command at Norman Cross in 1797, was of\r\nanother disposition: ‘un de ces moroses Anglais dont l’air sombre cache\r\nun caractère plus dur encore que sévère.’ He refused Ross’s request, and\r\neven admonished him for laxity of vigilance, and so our friends were\r\nsent back to the _Crown_, and got another month’s _cachot_. Then they\r\nwere separated, Havas being sent to the _Suffolk_ and Tom Souville to\r\nthe _Vengeance_. Six uneventful months passed; then the prisoners of the\r\n_Suffolk_ and _Vengeance_ were transferred to the _San Antonio_, and\r\nHavas and Souville were re-united, and took into partnership Étienne\r\nThibaut. The commander of the _San Antonio_ was an affable Scot with a\r\nsoft heart towards his prisoners. He took a fancy to Havas, often\r\nchatted with him, and at last engaged him as a French teacher. Captain\r\nB. had a pretty wife, ‘belle en tout point, blonde, grande, svelte et\r\ngracieuse,’ and a charming little girl, possessing ‘de bonnes joues\r\nroses, de grands yeux bleus, et des cheveux dorés à noyer sa tête si un\r\nruban ne les eût captivés sur son cou; enfant pétulante et gaie, fraîche\r\ncomme une fleur, vive comme un oiseau’.\r\n\r\nHavas makes friends with the child, but aims at the favour of the\r\nmother. Being a dashing, attractive, sailor-like fellow, he succeeds,\r\nand moves her sympathy for his fate. Finally Mrs. B. promises that he\r\nshall go with her to a French theatrical performance ashore, as her\r\nhusband rarely quits the ship except on duty. So they go, one fine\r\nspring day, she and Havas, and a Scots Captain R. with them to save\r\nappearances, first to the hulk _Veteran_ where they learn that the play,\r\nto be acted in Portchester Castle, will be Racine’s _Phèdre_, and that\r\nit will commence at 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nThey attended the play. An old caulker played Theseus, Phèdre was\r\npresented by a novice, and Hippolyte by a top-man, which probably means\r\nthat it was ludicrous. After the play, Captain R. went into the town,\r\nleaving Havas and Mrs. B. to enjoy a beautiful springtime walk together,\r\nwinding up with refreshments in an arbour which Mrs. B. had engaged. All\r\nthis time, however, Havas was not so intoxicated with the delightful\r\nnovelty of a _tête-à-tête_ walk with a pretty Englishwoman on a lovely\r\nday in a fair country, as not to be making mental notes of the local\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\nDuring the long continuance of the fine weather, which was all against\r\ntheir project, the three men made preparations for escape, and\r\nparticularly in the manufacture of wooden skates for use over the two\r\ngreat mud-banks which separated the hulks from the shore, and which had\r\nalways been fatal obstacles to escaping prisoners. At length the\r\nlong-looked-for change in the weather came, and at 1 a.m. on a wild,\r\nstormy morning Havas and Souville got off (in the French original I find\r\nno allusion to Thibaut), well furnished with necessaries, including\r\ncomplete suits of stylish clothing! Once they were challenged, but the\r\nuproar of the storm saved them, and, moreover, the sea, even in the\r\nland-locked part, was so high that the sentries had been withdrawn from\r\nthe external gallery. It was a hard struggle, but they reached the first\r\nmud-spit safely, got over it on their skates, swam another bit, and at\r\nthe second mud-bank had to rest, as Souville was taken with a sudden\r\nvertigo. Finally, after three terrible hours of contest with wind and\r\nwave, they landed. Thence they made their way into the fields, washed\r\nand scraped the mud off, and with the stylish clothes transformed\r\nthemselves, as the account says, into ‘elegants’.\r\n\r\nFor four hours they walked until they struck the London road, along\r\nwhich they tramped for an hour, that is until about 10 a.m., and\r\nbreakfasted at an inn. At 3 p.m. they reached Petersfield, went boldly\r\nto the best hotel, dined as became gentlemen of their appearance, and\r\nordered a post-chaise to be ready to take them to Brighton at 4 a.m.\r\n\r\nThey were three days on the journey to Brighton! Souville’s admirable\r\nEnglish was their protection, and the only inconvenience they\r\nexperienced was from the remarks of people who contrasted their elegant\r\nappearance with the small amount of luggage they carried, consisting of\r\na pocket-handkerchief containing their belongings.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Brighton at 10 a.m. on a Sunday morning. The Duke of\r\nYork had arrived there to review the troops assembled at Brighton Camp\r\non account of Bonaparte’s threatened invasion, so that the town was\r\ncrowded with soldiers and visitors, accommodation was not to be had, and\r\nno chance of sailing to France was likely to be offered. So they decided\r\nto walk on to Hastings, a risky proceeding, as the country swarmed with\r\nsoldiers. They walked for a day and a half, and then resolved to drive.\r\nFor the night they had lodged at an inn which was full of soldiers, all\r\nof whom were incited by rewards to look out for spies, so they shut\r\nthemselves in their room with food and two bottles of port, and busied\r\nthemselves with mending and furbishing up the elegant clothes, which\r\nwere beginning to show signs of wear and tear. The next day they left by\r\ncoach; their fellow passengers included a faded lady of thirty, a\r\n_comédienne_, so she said, with whom Souville soon became on such\r\nexcellent terms that she gave him her address at Hastings, and on the\r\nnext day he went for a pleasant walk with her, noting carefully the lie\r\nof the country and looking out for a suitable boat on the beach in which\r\nto get over to France. Boats in plenty there were; but, in accordance\r\nwith the Admiralty circular, inspired by the frequent appropriations of\r\nboats by escaping foreigners, from all of them masts, oars, and sails\r\nhad been removed. So our friends resolved to walk on to Folkestone. They\r\nreached the ‘Bay of Rice’ (Rye Bay?) and had to pass the night in the\r\nopen, as there was no inn, and arrived at Folkestone at 6 p.m. the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nDuring these stirring times of war between Britain and France, the\r\nFrench privateers and the English smugglers found it to be to their\r\nmutual interests to be good friends, for not only were the smugglers the\r\nchief carriers of escaped French prisoners, many of whom were officers\r\nof privateers, but they were valuable sources of information concerning\r\nthe movements of war-ships and likely prizes. In return the French\r\ncoastal authorities allowed them free access to their ports for purposes\r\nof the contraband trade. During his career afloat Souville had done a\r\ngood turn to Mr. J. P., an English smuggler captain living at\r\nFolkestone, and Mr. J. P. promised that he would requite this at the\r\nfirst opportunity. And so Tom determined to find him at Folkestone. His\r\nexcellent English soon procured him J. P.’s address, and there the\r\nfugitives had a royal reception, dinner, bed, a bath the next morning,\r\nfresh clothes and a change of linen. At breakfast they read the news of\r\ntheir escape and of the big reward offered for their recapture in the\r\nlocal newspaper.\r\n\r\nThey spent five happy days under this hospitable roof, waiting for\r\nfavourable weather, and for their host to procure them a suitable boat.\r\nThis came about in due course, and after a farewell banquet, the party,\r\nconsisting of Souville, arm-in-arm with Mrs. P., Havas with her sister,\r\nJ. P., and three friends, proceeded to the beach, and at 9 p.m. Souville\r\nand Havas embarked for Calais, where they arrived after a good passage,\r\nand had an enthusiastic reception, for it had been reported that in\r\nescaping from the _San Antonio_, they had been engulfed in the\r\nmud-banks.\r\n\r\nTom Souville lost no time in resuming his privateering life, and\r\ncontinued to be most successful, amassing money and gaining renown at\r\nthe same time, but in 1812, when on the _Renard_, having in tow a brig\r\nprize of 200 tons, he was again captured, and once more found himself on\r\nthe _Crown_ prison ship, in ‘Southampton Lake’. The _Crown_ was still\r\ncommanded by Ross—called in the original (which is in the form of an\r\ninterview with Souville by Eugene Sue) ‘Rosa’, that being the sound of\r\nthe name in French ears. Ross was a fine old fellow who had lost an arm\r\nat Trafalgar, but he hated the French. Ross, knowing Tom Souville’s\r\nfame, ironically conducts him personally over the _Crown_, pointing out\r\nall the latest devices for the prevention of escape, and tells Tom that\r\nhe will have a corporal specially told off to ‘attend to him’. He offers\r\nto allow Tom to go ashore every day if he will give his parole not to\r\nattempt escape, but Tom refuses.\r\n\r\nOn the _Crown_ Tom finds an old friend, Tilmont, a privateer captain,\r\nand they at once set to work on a plan for escape. One morning Captain\r\nRoss sends for Tom and quietly informs him that one Jolivet had sold him\r\nthe secret of the hole then in the process of being cut by Tom and\r\nTilmont, and as he tells him this they walk up and down the lower deck\r\ntogether. Whilst they are walking there is a great noise of tramping\r\noverhead. Ross asks what it is, and Tom replies that the prisoners are\r\ndancing. The captain calls an orderly and tells him to stop the dancing,\r\n‘the noise is distressing to Monsieur here,’ he adds sarcastically. Tom\r\nis annoyed and begs he will allow the poor men to amuse themselves, but\r\nthe captain is obdurate. Presently the noise ceases, and to Tom’s horror\r\nhe hears in the ensuing silence the sound of Tilmont working away at the\r\nhole. However, it did not attract the captain’s attention. The truth was\r\nthat the whole affair, the betrayal of the hole, the dancing on deck,\r\nand the interview with Captain Ross, was of Souville’s arranging.\r\nJolivet got £10 10_s._ for betraying the secret, which he at once paid\r\ninto the ship’s ‘Escape Fund’; he had made it a condition that Souville\r\nand Tilmont should not be punished; the dancing on deck was arranged to\r\nbe at the time of the interview between the captain and Tom, so that the\r\nnoise of Tilmont’s final touches to the work of boring the hole should\r\nbe drowned.\r\n\r\nA few days before this, one Dubreuil had attempted to escape, but had\r\nbeen suffocated in the mud-bank. On the morning after the interview\r\nabove described, the bugle sounded for all the prisoners to be paraded\r\non the upper deck. Here they found the captain and officers, all in full\r\nuniform, the guard drawn up with fixed bayonets, and on the deck in\r\nfront of them a long object covered with a black cloth. The cloth was\r\nremoved, and the wasted body of Dubreuil, with his eyes picked out, was\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nSouville was called forward.\r\n\r\n‘Do you recognize the body?’ asked the captain.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ replied Tom, ‘but it does not matter much. He was a bad fellow\r\nwho struck his mother.’\r\n\r\nThe horrible exhibition had been intended as a deterrent lesson to the\r\nprisoners in general and to Souville in particular, especially as it was\r\nknown that he and Dubreuil had been lifelong acquaintances in Calais,\r\nbut, as far as Tom was concerned, his reply sufficiently proved that it\r\nwas thrown away on him, whilst among the other prisoners it excited only\r\ndisgust and indignation.\r\n\r\nTom Souville’s escape was arranged for that same night.\r\n\r\nIt was quite favourable for his enterprise, dark and so stormy that the\r\nhulk rolled heavily. Tilmont made Tom take a good drink of sugar, rum,\r\nand coffee; the two men greased themselves all over thoroughly; round\r\nTom’s neck was an eelskin full of guineas, in his hat a map of the\r\nChannel, in a ‘boussole’ tinder and steel, a knife in the cord of his\r\nhat, and a change of clothes in a little leather bag on his back.\r\n\r\nOverboard he slipped (Tilmont’s name is not again mentioned, although he\r\ngreased himself, so I presume he did not start. There are many instances\r\nof poor fellows, after much elaborate preparation, being deterred at the\r\nlast moment by the darkness, the black depths below, the long swim, and\r\nthe extreme uncertainty of the result). It was a hard, long struggle in\r\nthe wild night, and throughout appeared the face of Dubreuil with its\r\nempty orbits before the swimmer. However, in two hours and a half he\r\nreached land. He rested for a while, cleaned the mud off, changed his\r\nclothes and started to walk.\r\n\r\nIn nine days he reached Winchelsea, walking by night and hiding by day,\r\nfor this time his clothes were not of the ‘elegant’ style, and the land\r\nwas full of spy-hunters. He went on to Folkestone, and rested by the\r\ngarden wall of a villa in the outskirts. As he rested he heard the voice\r\nof a woman singing in the garden. At once he recognized it as the voice\r\nof a captain’s wife who had been of the merry party at J. P.’s house on\r\nthe occasion of his last visit to Folkestone, called her by name, and\r\nannounced his own. He was warmly welcomed, there was a repetition of the\r\nold festivities, and in due course he was found a passage for Calais,\r\nwhere he arrived safely. Once more he trod the deck of the famous\r\n_Renard_, and was so successful that he saved money enough to buy a\r\ncutter on his own account. He soon became one of the most famous Channel\r\n_corsaires_; and in addition a popular hero, by his saving many lives at\r\nsea, not only of his own countrymen, but of English fishermen, and in\r\none case, of the crew of a British ship of war which had been disabled\r\nby foul weather.\r\n\r\nThen came the Peace of 1814; and when, after Waterloo, friendly\r\nrelationship was solidly established between the two countries, Tom\r\nSouville, only at home on the ocean, obtained command of the\r\ncross-channel packet _Iris_, which he retained almost up to the day of\r\nhis death in 1840, at the age of sixty-four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n                           THE PRISON SYSTEM\r\n                     THE PRISONERS ASHORE. GENERAL\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the Seven Years’ War, from 1756 to 1763, it\r\nbecame absolutely necessary, from the large annual increase in the\r\nnumber of prisoners of war brought to England, that some systematic\r\naccommodation for prisoners on land should be provided. Some idea of the\r\nincrease may be formed when we find that the number of prisoners of war\r\nin England at the end of 1756 was 7,261, and that in 1763, the last year\r\nof the war, it was 40,000.\r\n\r\nThe poor wretches for whom there was no room in the already overcrowded\r\nhulks were herded together wherever space could be found or made for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey were in borough jails—veritable hells on earth even when filled\r\nwith native debtors and felons: they were in common prisons such as the\r\nSavoy and Wellclose Square in London: they were in hired and adapted\r\nstrong houses such as the Wool House at Southampton, and the old pottery\r\nworks in Liverpool, or in adapted country houses such as Sissinghurst in\r\nKent, or in adapted farms like Roscrow and Kergilliack in Cornwall; or\r\nin barracks as at Winchester, Tynemouth and Edinburgh. Portchester\r\nCastle was but an adaptation, so was Forton, near Gosport, and the only\r\nplace of confinement built as a prison, and kept exclusively for\r\nprisoners of war, was for a long time the Millbay prison at Plymouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 public attention was drawn to the ‘dangerous spirit’ among the\r\nFrench prisoners in England. Escapes were frequent, were carried out by\r\nlarge bodies of men, and in many cases were characterized by open acts\r\nof defiance and violence. Inquiries were made about places which could\r\nbe prepared to accommodate, between them, from fifteen to twenty\r\nthousand prisoners of war. No place was too sacred for the\r\nprison-hunters. A report upon the suitability of Kenilworth Castle was\r\ndrawn up by a Dr. Palmer, who concluded, ‘If the buildings are\r\ncompleted, some thousands of prisoners will be so accommodated as I\r\nflatter myself will reflect Honour on the British Nation.’\r\n\r\nGeneral Simon, we shall see later, was confined in Dumbarton Castle. The\r\nRoyal Palace at Linlithgow only escaped conversion into a war prison by\r\nthe exertions of Viscount Dundas, Lord of the Admiralty—a fact to which\r\nSir Walter Scott thus alludes in _Waverley_:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘They halted at Linlithgow, distinguished by its ancient palace, which,\r\nSixty Years since, was entire and habitable, and whose venerable ruins,\r\n_not quite Sixty Years since_, very narrowly escaped the unworthy fate\r\nof being converted into a barrack for French prisoners. May repose and\r\nblessings attend the ashes of the patriotic statesman, who, amongst his\r\nlast services to Scotland, interposed to prevent this profanation!’\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the business of searching for suitable places and of adaptation of\r\nunsuitable went on, the prisoners being of course the chief sufferers,\r\nwhich in that hard, merciless age was not a matter of much concern, and\r\nit was not until 1782 that a move in the right direction seemed to be\r\nmade by the abandonment of the old evil place of confinement at Knowle,\r\nnear Bristol (visited and commented on by Wesley in 1759 and 1760, and\r\nby Howard in 1779), and the transfer of the prisoners to the ‘Fish\r\nPonds’ prison, better known later as Stapleton.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Howard says, in his General Report upon the prisons on land,\r\n‘The French Government made an allowance of 3_d._ per diem to Captains,\r\nMates, sailing masters and surgeons; 2_d._ per diem to boatswains,\r\ncarpenters, and petty officers generally, and 1_d._ per diem to all\r\nbelow these ratings (which is almost exactly the same as the allowances\r\nmade by the British Government to its prisoners abroad). There is,\r\nbesides, a supply from the same Court of clothes, linen, and shoes to\r\nthose who are destitute of these articles; a noble and exemplary\r\nprovision much to the honour of those who at present conduct public\r\naffairs in France.’\r\n\r\nHoward found the American prisoners, except at Pembroke, clean and well\r\nclothed, thanks to liberal supplies from their own country as well as\r\nfrom England. He noted the care and assiduity of the ‘Sick and Hurt’\r\nOffice in London, and decided that England and France treated foreign\r\nprisoners very much alike on the whole.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 Charles Townshend wrote to the Earl of Ailesbury: ‘The French\r\nprisoners have their quarters in Hillsea Barracks (Portsmouth), find our\r\nbiscuit and beef much better than their own, and are astonished at the\r\ngood treatment they meet with. Most of them are very young, and were\r\ndriven on board by the bayonet.’\r\n\r\nI quote this as I am only too glad when I come across any record or\r\nevidence which can serve to brighten the dark dreary record of these\r\nchapters in our national history.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 there were 13,666 prisoners of war in Britain, of whom 1,357\r\nwere officers on parole; of the remainder the largest number, 4,769,\r\nwere at Portchester Castle.\r\n\r\nIn 1796–7 the great dépôt at Norman Cross near Peterborough, to contain\r\n7,000 prisoners, was built and occupied. In 1798, further inquiries were\r\nmade by the Government for prison accommodation, as the inflow of\r\nprisoners was unceasing and ever increasing, the total for this year\r\nbeing 35,000. The advertised specifications give us an idea of the space\r\nthen considered sufficient for prisoners. Besides accommodation for a\r\ngarrison calculated at the proportion of one guard for every twenty\r\nprisoners, cells were required measuring eight feet by seven, and eleven\r\nfeet high, for four or five prisoners, or rooms twenty-four feet by\r\ntwenty-two to be divided into nine cells, and replies were received from\r\nColdbath Fields, London, Liverpool, Manchester, Preston, Lancaster\r\nCastle, Shrewsbury, and Dorchester.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 Stapleton Prison, near Bristol, was to be enlarged so as to be\r\nready in June 1800, for twice its then complement of prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 a very general impression was prevalent in high places that an\r\ninvasion of England was imminent from Ireland with which the prisoners\r\nof war all over the country, but especially the Western counties, were\r\nto be associated, and so, at the request of Sir Rupert George of the\r\nTransport Office, a detailed report was drawn up by Mr. Yorke of the\r\nbest means to be taken to guard against this. To this was appended a\r\nmemorandum of the capacity and condition of various inland prisons, such\r\nas Manchester, Stafford, Shrewsbury, Dorchester, Gloucester, Coldbath\r\nFields in London, and Liverpool.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 the great prison at Dartmoor, built to hold 6,000 prisoners, and\r\nthus relieve the dangerous congestion at Plymouth, was founded, but the\r\nfirst prisoners did not enter it until 1809. In 1811 a large dépôt was\r\nformed at Valleyfield near Penicuik on the Esk, about nine miles south\r\nof Edinburgh, which was gradually enlarged until at the Peace of 1814 it\r\ncontained 10,000 prisoners.\r\n\r\nSo by this time, 1814, there were nine large prisons at Dartmoor, Norman\r\nCross, Millbay, Stapleton, Valleyfield, Forton, Portchester, Chatham\r\n(where the present St. Mary’s Barracks were first used as a war-prison),\r\nand Perth, holding about 45,000 prisoners; there were about 2,000\r\nofficers on parole; the hulks at Portsmouth, Plymouth, and Chatham—about\r\nfifty ships—would hold nearly 35,000 prisoners, and the grand total\r\nwould be well in excess of the largest number of war prisoners in\r\nBritain in one year, that is, 72,000 in 1814.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the following notification was sent to the Admiralty, who\r\nevidently treated it seriously, as a copy of it was sent to the agents\r\nof all the war prisons in the country:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ‘Extra Secret Intelligence.\r\n\r\n‘The large fleet here (Boulogne) remain perfectly inactive, but the\r\nFlotilla are only waiting for orders. I was yesterday told by one of the\r\nCaptains that 6,000 men would soon be embarked, that the place of\r\nlanding was to be as near as possible to Stilton Prison (Norman Cross)\r\nand that every man was to carry two complete sets of arms, &c., in order\r\nto equip the prisoners they may release.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThree men, named La Ferre, Denisham, and De Mussy, were to land as\r\nAmerican gentlemen, and to take charge quietly and unobtrusively. The\r\nhead-quarters were to be near Liverpool, Hull, and between Portsmouth\r\nand Plymouth, whence these emissaries were to gain access to all the\r\nprisons, and prepare the minds of the inmates for the Great Event.\r\n\r\nNothing came of this, but the correspondence of the Transport Office\r\nreveals the fact that by one means or another a more or less regular\r\ncorrespondence was kept up between France and the prisons, and that\r\nthere were concerned in it some very well known officers on parole, and\r\neven some Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe captaincy of a war prison was no sinecure, and if history shows that\r\none or two of the officers occupying the position were ill-fitted for\r\nit, assuredly they had no reason to complain of a lack of rules,\r\nregulations, and instructions from head-quarters, and they were called\r\nto order in no measured terms.\r\n\r\nThe care of the prisoners themselves, desperate, restless, cunning\r\nrascals as many of them were, seems to have bothered the agent much less\r\nthan the care of those who were in any way associated with the working\r\nof the prison—the big and little officials, the officers and soldiers of\r\nthe garrison, the contractors, the tradesmen, the workmen, the servants,\r\nthe innkeepers, farmers, post-office officials, even the stage coachmen\r\nand guards, not to mention the neighbouring gentry, parsons and old\r\nladies who, of course, knew very much better how to run a war-prison\r\nthan did Captain Pressland, or Captain Cotgrave, or Captain Draper, or\r\nany other selected man.\r\n\r\nAnother fact which contributed to the irksomeness of the post was that\r\nalthough a naval captain was always the head of a war prison, and his\r\nturnkeys were generally of the same service, and he was the responsible\r\nhead of the establishment, the guardianship of the prisoners was\r\nabsolutely in the hands of the military authorities, who were therefore\r\nresponsible for the safe-keeping of the prisoners. Any difference\r\ntherefore between the naval captain and the military colonel as to the\r\narrangement and disposal of the guards—and such differences were\r\nfrequent—was sure to betray itself in the condition of the prison.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily understood that although it was the naval captain in\r\ncharge of a prison who was held responsible for every escape of a\r\nprisoner, he would be pretty sure to put the _onus_ of it on to the\r\nmilitary commander, who, in turn, would be ready to attribute the mishap\r\nto anything but deficiency in the arrangement of sentries or to any\r\nslackness on the part of his men.\r\n\r\nTake again the position of the war prisoner agent, as he was called,\r\nwith regard to the numberless appeals to his humanity with which he was\r\nassailed. The period of the Great Wars was not characterized by\r\nhyper-sensitiveness on the score of human suffering and want, although I\r\nthoroughly believe that the men selected for the position of war\r\nprisoner agents were generally as kindly disposed and as sympathetic, as\r\nrefined and well-bred Englishmen as could be in an age not remarkable\r\nfor gentleness. It must be remembered that they had ever to be on their\r\nguard against ruse and stratagem.\r\n\r\nA forcible illustration is afforded by the much vexed question of the\r\nreligious condition of the prisoners. In 1798 the Bishop of Léon asked\r\nthat French priests should be allowed to minister to the prisoners at\r\nPortchester and Stapleton, and, although it was notorious that by far\r\nthe greater number of Frenchmen were not merely indifferent to religion,\r\nbut avowed preachers of atheism, the permission was given, and the Abbés\r\nDe La Marc and Pasquier were told off for duty. Later on, however, it\r\nwould seem that the privilege thus accorded had been grossly abused, and\r\nthe permission cancelled, for the Transport Office writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The T. O. regrets that it is not in their power to permit the _émigré_\r\npriests to visit War Prisons. We feel it our duty, however, to say that\r\nin the present difficult times when pretended Friends are not always\r\ndistinguishable from real Foes, we feel it our Duty to be on our guard\r\nrespecting Intercourse with all Prisoners of war under our charge, and\r\nthough we have a sincere desire to promote the interests of the\r\nChristian Religion under any Denomination, yet where it has been, and is\r\nuniformly, if not universally, insulted by the Republicans of your\r\nNation who constitute the bulk of our captives, we must be cautious of\r\nevery species of Introduction to men so generally unprincipled, and who\r\nare at best the Dupes of an ignorant and insidious Philosophy. We allow\r\nmuch when we grant permission to your Priests upon the express desire of\r\nthe Parties, and we appeal to you whether it be not an indulgence which\r\nwould not be conceded to Protestant Divines under similar circumstances\r\nin any Roman Catholic Country, and particularly in France itself under\r\nits ancient Government.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bishop also applies to have a priest at Deal. The Transport Office\r\nrefuses, saying that Deal is not a dépôt for prisoners, but only a\r\nreceiving place, and there are no turnkeys and clerks, such ‘as the\r\nadmission of an Ecclesiastic might render necessary’.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, the same Bishop of Léon had the assurance to request the\r\nrelease of a French priest taken under arms. To this the Transport\r\nOffice replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Board is rather surprised that you should apply to them on behalf\r\nof such a person, as they conceive it to be against the spirit of all\r\nReligion that men in Holy Orders should be found in Military Array, and\r\nthey are more convinced that they should not comply with such a request,\r\nas no assurance can be given or be relied on that so unprincipled a man\r\nmay not put off his Function for his own purposes a second time and\r\nrepeat his enormity.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1808, the Bishop of Moulins was chaplain to the prisoners at Norman\r\nCross, and, according to the Rev. Arthur Brown, author of a little book\r\nabout this prison, devoted his life to the spiritual regeneration of the\r\npoor fellows in captivity, although Dr. Walker, of Peterborough,\r\nestimates the bishop somewhat differently.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, his boy attendant, a prisoner, was found guilty of breaking\r\none of the prison rules by selling straw hats clandestinely made by the\r\nprisoners, and was ordered back into confinement. The bishop, who did\r\nnot live in the prison, but was staying at the _Bell_, in Stilton,\r\napplied for another prisoner attendant, but was refused.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1814, the British and Foreign Bible Society asked that the\r\nTransport Office agents should be allowed to distribute New Testaments\r\namong the prisoners at Stapleton and Norman Cross. The Office replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We cannot impress such a duty on our agents, as they consider it an\r\nimpossibility to prevent the prisoners from selling them, as all the\r\nVigilance exercised by the officers of the Department is insufficient to\r\nprevent the prisoners from making away with the most necessary articles\r\nof clothing and bedding.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the Transport Office were justified in their refusal is confirmed\r\nby an incident at the final embarkation of the French prisoners from the\r\nPerth dépôt in July of the same year, 1814. A considerable number of\r\nFrench Testaments were sent from Edinburgh to be distributed among the\r\nprisoners leaving for France. The distribution was duly made, but by the\r\ntime the prisoners had reached the waterside, almost every man had sold\r\nhis Testament for a trifling sum.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted, I think, that the hardships endured by the\r\nprisoners in the war prisons were very much exaggerated, and also that\r\nto a very large extent the prisoners brought them upon themselves.\r\nEspecially was this the case in the matter of insufficient food and\r\nclothing. Gambling was the besetting sin of the prisons, and to get the\r\nwherewithal to gamble the prisoners sold clothing, bedding, and not only\r\ntheir rations for the day, but for days to come. At Dartmoor the evil\r\noccasioned by the existence of the sale of rations by prisoners to\r\n‘brokers’, who resold them at a profit, was so great that Captain\r\nCotgrave, the Governor, in February 1813, sent a number of the ‘brokers’\r\nto the _cachot_. To their remonstrance he replied, in writing, much as a\r\nsailor man he would have spoken:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘To the Prisoners in the Cachot for purchasing Provisions. The Orders to\r\nput you on short allowance (2/3rds) from the Commissioners of His\r\nMajesty’s Transport Board is for purchasing the provisions of your\r\nfellow prisoners, by which means numbers have died from want of food,\r\nand the hospital is filled with sick not likely to recover. The number\r\nof deaths occasioned by this inhuman practise occasions considerable\r\nexpense to the Government, not only in coffins, but the hospital is\r\nfilled with these poor, unhappy wretches so far reduced from want of\r\nfood that they linger a considerable time in the hospital at the\r\nGovernment’s expense, and then fall a victim to the cruelty of those who\r\nhave purchased their provisions, to the disgrace of Christians and\r\nwhatever nation they belong to.\r\n\r\n‘The testimony of the surgeons and your countrymen prove the fact.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal was useless, and he issued a proclamation a month later,\r\nthreatening to stop the markets if the practice was persisted in. This\r\nwas equally fruitless. Charitable people pitied the poor half-naked\r\nprisoners in winter, and supplied them abundantly with clothing; but\r\nwhen the same men were pointed out to them a few days later as naked as\r\nbefore, and it was represented to them that by their well-meant\r\nbenevolence they were actually encouraging that which it was most\r\ndesirable to check, they refused to believe it. Hence it became\r\nnecessary to punish severely. The most efficacious form of punishment\r\nwas to put an offender’s name at the bottom of the list for being\r\nexchanged against British prisoners to be sent from France or whatever\r\ncountry we happened to be at war with. But even this had no deterrent\r\neffect upon some, and the frenzy for gain was so remarkable that in all\r\nthe prisons there was a regular market for the purchase and sale of\r\nplaces on the Exchange List, until the Government stopped the practice.\r\nThe most common form of punishment was putting offenders on short\r\nallowance. For making away with hammock, bed, or blanket, the prisoner\r\nwas put on short allowance for ten days; for making away with any two of\r\nthese articles he was docked for fourteen days; for cutting or damaging\r\nbedding or clothes, he had half rations for five days and had to make\r\nthe damage good.\r\n\r\nActs of violence brought confinement in the _cachot_ or Black Hole. A\r\nprisoner who wounded a turnkey was to be kept handcuffed, with his hands\r\nbehind him, for not less than twelve hours, and for not more than\r\ntwenty-four!\r\n\r\nFor murder and forgery the prisoners came under the civil law; death was\r\nthe penalty for both, but until 1810 no prisoner-forgers, although\r\nconvicted, had been punished with death in England, owing to a doubt in\r\nthe minds of judges whether prisoners of war were answerable to\r\nmunicipal tribunals for this sort of offence, which is not against the\r\nlaw of nations.\r\n\r\nPrisoners who were not mentally or physically gifted enough to earn\r\nmoney by the exercise of their talents or employment in handicraft, had\r\nother opportunities of doing so. For working about the prisons as\r\ncarpenters, gardeners, washermen, they were paid threepence a day. As\r\nhelpers in the infirmaries—one to every ten patients—they received\r\nsixpence a day. Officers recaptured after breaking their parole or sent\r\nto prison for serious offences were glad, if they had means, to pay\r\nprisoners threepence a day to act as their servants, and do their dirty\r\nwork generally. At the same rate sweepers were engaged at the ratio of\r\none to every hundred men; cooks, in the proportion of one for every 400\r\nmen, received 4½_d._ a day, and barbers earned 3_d._ a day. At Dartmoor\r\nsome five hundred prisoners were employed in these and other ways, each\r\nman wearing on his cap a tin plate with the nature of his calling\r\nthereon inscribed. A necessarily rough estimate showed that nearly half\r\nof the inmates of the war prisons made honest money in one way or\r\nanother; the remainder were gamblers and nothing else. Still, a very\r\nlarge number of the wage-earners were gamblers also. Of these various\r\nprofessions and trades much will be said in the accounts of the prison\r\nlife which follow, and when comparisons are instituted between the\r\nversatility, the deftness, the ingenuity, the artistic feeling, and the\r\nindustry of the French prisoners in Britain, and the helpless indolence\r\nof the British prisoners abroad, testimony is unconsciously given in\r\nfavour of that national system by which men of all social grades, of all\r\nprofessions, and of all trades, are compelled to serve in the defence of\r\ntheir country, as contrasted with that which, until late years, deemed\r\nonly the scum of the population as properly liable to military service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                         1. SISSINGHURST CASTLE\r\n\r\nAbout the Sissinghurst one looks on to-day there is little indeed to\r\nremind us that here stood, one hundred and fifty years ago, a famous war\r\nprison, and it is hard to realize that in this tranquil, picturesque,\r\nout-of-the-way nook of Kent, for seven long years, more than three\r\nthousand captive fighting men dragged out a weary existence.\r\n\r\nOriginally the splendid seat of the Baker family, and in the heyday of\r\nits grandeur one of the Kentish halting-places of Queen Elizabeth during\r\nher famous progress in 1571, it had far fallen from its high estate\r\nwhen, in 1756, Government, hard pressed to find accommodation for the\r\nannually increasing numbers of prisoners of war, leased it.\r\n\r\nOf the ‘Castle’, as it came to be called, of this period, the\r\ngate-house, a line of outbuildings which were partially used as barracks\r\nfor the troops on guard, and a few memories, alone survive. The great\r\nquadrangle has disappeared, but the line of the ancient moat, in parts\r\nstill filled with water, in part incorporated with garden ground, still\r\nenables the visitor to trace the original extent of the buildings. Part\r\nof the line of ivy-clad buildings which face the approach are said to\r\nhave been used as a small-pox hospital, and the name François may still\r\nbe seen carved on the brick; the field known as the ‘Horse Race’ was the\r\nprison cemetery, and human remains have sometimes within living memory\r\nbeen disturbed therein.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, legends of the prison linger but faintly in the\r\nneighbourhood; but from some of these it would seem that\r\nofficer-prisoners at Sissinghurst were allowed out on parole. The\r\nplace-name ‘Three Chimneys’, at a point where three roads meet, exactly\r\none mile from Sissinghurst, is said to be a corruption of ‘Trois\r\nChemins’, so called by the French prisoners whose limit it marked.\r\n\r\nWilsley House, just out of Cranbrook, a fine old residence, formerly\r\nbelonging to a merchant prince of the Kentish cloth trade, now occupied\r\nby Colonel Alexander, is said to have been tenanted by French officers\r\non parole, and some panel paintings in one of the rooms are said to have\r\nbeen their work, but I think they are of earlier date. The neighbouring\r\nBarrack Farm is said to have been the prison garrison officers’\r\nquarters, and the house next to the Sissinghurst Post Office is by\r\ntradition the old garrison canteen.\r\n\r\nThe only individual from whom I could gather any recollections of the\r\nFrench prisoner days was an old farm labourer named Gurr, living at\r\nGoford. He told me that his great-grandfather, ploughing one day near\r\nthe prison, suddenly saw three men creeping along a hedgerow close to\r\nhim. Recognizing them to be Sissinghurst prisoners, he armed himself\r\nwith the coulter of his plough and went up to them. The poor fellows\r\nseemed exhausted and bewildered, and went with him back to the Castle\r\nwithout offering any resistance, telling him on the way that they had\r\ngot out by tunnelling under the moat with small mattocks. Gurr said that\r\nhe had often dug up human bones in the meadow opposite the Castle\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, I think, was written from Sissinghurst, but it may\r\nbe from Portchester. I insert it here as in all contemporary\r\ncorrespondence ‘le château’ means Sissinghurst.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        ‘Le Château, 30^{me}  mai, 1756.\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘MONSIEUR:\r\n\r\n‘La présente est pour vous prier de nous donner de délargissement,\r\nattendu que nous ne sommes point obligés pour une personne de nous voir\r\ndetenus commes nous sommes.

Si Mr. Cook n’avoit rien à se reprocher il ne\r\nretiendrait pas les lettres que nous vous addressons. Tout le monde\r\nscait ce que mérite celuy qui détourne des oreilles de justice, les cris\r\nde ceux qui la réclame et qui n’ont d’autre crime que d’être infortunés,\r\nnous espérons nosseigneurs que vous y aurez egarder que vous nous ferez\r\njustice, nous vous aurons à jamais l’obligation.\r\n\r\n                             ‘Vos humbles et très obeisans serviteurs\r\n                                 ‘Pour tous les prisonniers en général.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAt about the same date twenty-seven paroled naval officers at Cranbrook\r\nsigned a complaint that they were not allowed by the one-mile limit of\r\ntheir parole to visit their crews, prisoners at Sissinghurst, two miles\r\naway, to help them in their distress and to prevent them being robbed by\r\nthe English who have the monopoly of getting things for sale into the\r\nprison, notably the jailers and the canteen man, not to mention others.\r\nAlso that the prisoners at Sissinghurst had no chance of ventilating\r\ntheir grievances, which were heavy and many:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘De remédier à une injustice, ou plutôt à une cruauté que les nations\r\nles plus barbares n’exercisions. En effet c’est une tiranie audieuse que\r\nde vouloir forcer des pauvres prisonniers à n’acheter d’autre\r\nmarchandises que celles venant des mains de leurs Gardiens, et\r\nd’empécher leurs parens et amis de leur envoyer à beaucoup meilleur\r\nmarché aussy bien.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the letters from relations in France to prisoners at\r\nSissinghurst are preserved at the Record Office. It is only from\r\nacquaintance with these poor tattered, blotted ebullitions of affection\r\nand despair that the modern Englishman can glean a notion of what\r\nconfinement in an English prison of husbands, fathers, brothers, and\r\nlovers meant to hundreds of poor, simple peasant and fisher women of\r\nFrance. The breath of most of them is religious resignation: in a few, a\r\nvery few, a spirit of resentment and antagonism to Britain is prominent;\r\nmost of them are humble domestic chronicles blended with prayers for a\r\nspeedy liberation and for courage in the meanwhile. There is nothing\r\nquite like these mid-eighteenth century letters in the correspondence of\r\nthe succeeding great struggle, when the principles of the Revolution had\r\npenetrated to the homes of the lowliest. One sees reflected in it the\r\nsimplicity, the childish confidence in the rightness and fitness of all\r\nin authority, and, above all, the deep sense of religion, which invested\r\nthe peasantry of France with a great and peculiar charm.\r\n\r\nDuring this year, 1758, the letters of complaint are many and pitiful,\r\nthe chief subject being the non-delivery to prisoners of their letters,\r\nand the undue surveillance exercised over correspondence of the\r\ntenderest private nature. In 1760 the occupants of Sissinghurst received\r\ntheir share of the clothes provided by English compassion. Many of them\r\nwere accused of selling these clothes, to which they replied that it was\r\nto buy necessaries or tobacco, or for postage, and added that they had\r\nbeen for a long time on half-rations.\r\n\r\nOn October 14 a desperate attempt to escape was made, and frustrated in\r\nan unnecessarily brutal manner. A prisoner named Artus, his brother, and\r\nother prisoners discovered a disused latrine. Into this they crept,\r\nbroke through a brick wall by a drain, and reached the edge of the moat,\r\nand crossed it to the opposite bank close to the first of the three\r\nsentries on duty along it. This was at ten o’clock on a moonlight night.\r\nTwo of the prisoners passed the first and second sentries and got some\r\nway into the fields. Artus and his brother were to follow, and were\r\ncrawling on hands and knees to avoid being seen. The first sentry, who\r\nwas close by, did nothing, having probably been bribed; but the other\r\ntwo sentries, being alarmed by a fourth sentry, who was on the right\r\nhand of the first, ran up and challenged Artus, who cried: ‘Don’t fire!\r\nSurrender!’ But the sentry disregarded this, wounded him in two places\r\non the arm, tearing his waistcoat, and then fired at him point blank,\r\nblowing off half his head. Artus’s brother, three yards behind, was\r\nsecured by a drummer who was armed with nothing but a drumstick, thus\r\nproving the utterly unnecessary killing of Artus. Two other prisoners\r\nwere captured later in the drain, ready to come out.\r\n\r\nIn the _Annual Register_ we read that on Saturday, July 16, 1760, the\r\nalarm was given that a thousand prisoners had broken out of the Castle\r\nand were abroad in the country. ‘To arms’ was beaten immediately. ‘You\r\nwould have been pleased to see with what readiness and alacrity the\r\nSurrey Militia here, universally, officers and men, advanced towards the\r\nplace of danger’, says the correspondent, ‘I say, “towards,” because\r\nwhen they got as far as Milkhouse Street, the alarm was discovered to be\r\na mistake. Many of the townspeople and countrymen joined them.’\r\n\r\nOn one Sunday morning in 1761 the good people of Cranbrook were sent\r\nflying out of church by the news that the Sissinghurst prisoners had\r\nbroken out and were scouring the country fully armed, but this also was\r\na false alarm.\r\n\r\nIt was from the top of the still standing gatehouse-tower that the deed\r\nwas perpetrated which caused the following entry in the Cranbrook\r\nRegister:\r\n\r\n‘1761. William Bassuck: killed by a French prisoner.’ Bassuck was on\r\nsentry-go below, and the Frenchman dropped a pail on him.\r\n\r\nIn 1762 the misery of the prisoners at Sissinghurst culminated in a\r\nPetition to the Admiralty, signed by almost all of them, of so forcible\r\nand circumstantial a character, that in common justice it could not be\r\noverlooked, and so Dr. Maxwell was sent down to examine the charges\r\nagainst Cooke, the agent.\r\n\r\nThe Complaints and their replies were as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) That the provisions were bad in quality, of short measure and badly\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n  Reply: Not proved.\r\n\r\n(2) That cheese had been stopped four ‘maigre’ days in succession to\r\nmake good damage done by prisoners.\r\n\r\n  Reply: Only upon two days.\r\n\r\n(3) That prisoners had been put upon half allowance in the _cachot_ or\r\nBlack Hole for staying in the wards on account of not having sufficient\r\nclothing to leave them.\r\n\r\n  Reply: They were not put in the _cachot_, but upon half allowance for\r\nremaining in the wards during the day contrary to the Regulations. There\r\nwas no need for them to lack ‘cloaths’.\r\n\r\n(4) That they were put upon half allowance for appearing at a sudden\r\nmuster without clothes.\r\n\r\n  Reply: This muster was ordered by the agent, Cooke, because he\r\nsuspected the prisoners of embezzling clothes and of gambling them away.\r\n\r\n(5) That the prisoners had been threatened with being deprived of their\r\nturn of Exchange for signing this Petition to the Board of Admiralty.\r\n\r\n  Reply: There was no foundation for this statement.\r\n\r\n(6) That Cooke had refused to pay them for more than eighteen days’ work\r\nin carrying coals, although they were twenty-eight days.\r\n\r\n  Reply: In reality they had only worked for parts of these days, and\r\nhad been paid for the work actually done.\r\n\r\n(7) That Cooke showed no zeal for the welfare of the prisoners.\r\n\r\n  Reply: That there is no foundation for this statement.\r\n\r\n(8) That they were ill-treated by the Militia guards.\r\n\r\nThis last complaint was the most serious of all, and the examination\r\ninto it revealed a state of affairs by no means creditable to the\r\nauthorities. Here it should be stated that on account of the great\r\nand constant demand made by the war upon the regular troops, the\r\ntask of guarding the prisons was universally performed by the\r\nMilitia—undesirable men from more than one point of view, especially\r\nfrom their lack of self-restraint and their accessibility to\r\nbribery. The following cases were cited. On November 28, 1757,\r\nFerdinand Brehost, or Gratez, was shot dead by a sentry of General\r\nAmherst’s regiment. The sentry in defence said that he had had\r\norders to fire upon any prisoners who did not take down the clothes\r\nthey hung upon the palisades when ordered to.\r\n\r\nIt was adjudged that the sentry fired too precipitately.\r\n\r\nOn the night of October 29, 1759, the prisoner Jacobus Loffe was shot\r\ndead in his hammock by a sentry.\r\n\r\nIn defence the sentry said that he called out several times for the\r\nprisoners to put out their lights. They refused and bid him fire and be\r\ndamned. The evidence showed that all the prisoners were asleep, and that\r\nthe light seen by the sentry was the reflection on the window of a lamp\r\noutside the building.\r\n\r\nThe same judgement as in the other case was given.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 1760, two prisoners were shot by a sentry. John Bramston,\r\nthe sentry, said in defence that a prisoner came too near the forbidden\r\nbarrier, refused to keep off when ordered to, with the result that\r\nBramston fired, killed him, and another prisoner further away.\r\n\r\nBramston was tried at Maidstone and acquitted, the jury finding that he\r\ndid no more than his duty in accordance with the general orders at the\r\nCastle. Still, it came out in evidence that orders had been issued that\r\nsentries were not to fire if the object could be secured by the turnkey.\r\nColonel Fairfax indeed ordered that sentries were not to fire at all. He\r\nhad found out that Bramston was sometimes out of his senses, and he had\r\ndischarged him from the service, but he was actually on duty after this\r\naffair, was found to have loaded his piece with two balls, and after the\r\nmurder on the 11th had threatened to kill more prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the same day two other prisoners were stabbed by sentries. In one\r\ncase, however, a prisoner gave evidence in favour of the sentry, saying\r\nthat he did not believe there was any intention to kill, but that the\r\nsentry being surrounded by a crowd of prisoners, pushed his bayonet to\r\nkeep them at a distance for fear that they intended mischief.\r\n\r\nIt also came out that the soldiers were allowed to strike the prisoners\r\nwith the flats of their sabres. This was now forbidden. Also that the\r\nsoldiers abused the power they had of taking away the prisoners’ knives\r\nwhen they made improper use of them, and actually sold the knives thus\r\nconfiscated to other prisoners. Also that the soldiers wilfully damaged\r\nforms and tables so that the prisoners should be punished.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners of the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office, in their summing up of\r\nDr. Maxwell’s evidence, said that, while there was no doubt much\r\nexaggeration by the petitioners, there was too much reason for\r\ncomplaint, and found that the person in charge was not so much to blame,\r\nbut the ‘common centinels’, whose understanding did not enable them to\r\ndistinguish between the letter and the meaning of their orders, and that\r\nthis arose from the lack of printed standing orders. The officers of the\r\nguard had arbitrary powers independent of the agent, and the latter said\r\nwhen asked why he did not complain to the Board, that he did not care to\r\ndispute with the officers.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that this inquiry was not held until 1762, that is to\r\nsay, until seven years of tyranny had been practised upon these\r\nunfortunate foreigners, and seven years of nameless horrors suffered in\r\nforced silence. Small wonder that throughout the correspondence of this\r\nperiod Sissinghurst is spoken of with disgust and loathing.\r\n\r\nThe record of only one Sissinghurst prisoner marrying an Englishwoman\r\nexists—that, in 1762, of Laurence Calberte, ‘a prisoner among the French\r\nat Sissinghurst House’, to Mary Pepper.\r\n\r\nI have to thank Mr. Neve of the Castle House, Sissinghurst, for his\r\nkindness in allowing me to have the photograph taken of some exquisite\r\nlittle articles made in wood by Sissinghurst prisoners, and also to\r\nreproduce a picture of the ‘Castle’, as it was when used as a prison.\r\n\r\nAfter its evacuation at the Peace of Paris, in 1763, Sissinghurst Castle\r\nbecame a workhouse, and when it ceased to be used for this purpose\r\ngradually fell into ruin and was pulled down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ARTICLES IN WOOD MADE BY THE PRISONERS AT SISSINGHURST CASTLE, 1763\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                            2. NORMAN CROSS\r\n\r\nIt is just as hard for the visitor to-day to the site of Norman Cross,\r\nto realize that here stood, until almost within living memory, a huge\r\nwar-prison, as it is at Sissinghurst. Whether one approaches it from\r\nPeterborough, six miles away, through the semi-rural village of Yaxley,\r\nby which name the prison was often called, or by the Great North Road\r\nfrom Stilton—famous for the sale, not the manufacture, of the famous\r\ncheese, and for the wreck of one of the stateliest coaching inns of\r\nEngland, the _Bell_—we see but a large, ordinary-looking meadow, dotted\r\nwith trees, with three or four houses on its borders, and except for its\r\nsize, which is nearly forty acres, differing in no way from the fields\r\naround.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the space, however, under the guidance of Dr. Walker,\r\ndoes reveal remains. We can trace the great ditch which passed round the\r\nprison inside the outer wall; some of the twenty-one wells which were\r\nsunk still remain, and about thirty feet of the original red brick wall,\r\nbuilt in the old ‘English bond’ style, is still above ground. As, with\r\nthe exceptions presently to be noted, the prisons proper, with the\r\noffices pertaining thereto, were built entirely of wood, and were sold\r\nand removed when the prison ceased to be, nothing of it remains here,\r\nalthough some of the buildings were re-erected in Peterborough and the\r\nneighbouring villages, and may still be seen. The only war-time\r\nbuildings remaining are the Prison Superintendent’s house, now occupied\r\nby Alderman Herbert, and the agent’s house, now belonging to Mr. Franey,\r\nboth, of course, much altered and beautified, and one which has been\r\nvariously described to me as the officers’ quarters and the Barrack\r\nMaster’s residence. In the Musée Historique Militaire at the Invalides,\r\nin Paris, there is a most minutely and beautifully executed model of the\r\nNorman Cross Prison, the work of one Foulley, who was a prisoner here\r\nfor five years and three months. Not only are the buildings, wells,\r\npalisades, pumps, troughs, and other details represented, but tiny\r\nmodels of prisoners at work and at play are dotted about, and in front\r\nof the chief, the eastern gate, a battalion of Militia is drawn up,\r\ncomplete to the smallest particulars of arms and equipment.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting relic of the prison days is the prisoners’\r\nburial-ground at the lower end of a field sloping down from the west\r\nside of the Great North Road.\r\n\r\nOn July 28 of the present year (1914) a memorial to the prisoners of war\r\nwho died at Norman Cross was unveiled by Lord Weardale. The idea\r\noriginated with Dr. T. J. Walker and Mr. W. H. Sands, and was developed\r\nby the Entente Cordiale Society. The memorial is in the form of a stone\r\npillar, surmounted by an eagle with outstretched wings, standing upon a\r\nsquare pedestal approached by steps, the lowermost of which is shaped\r\nlike the palisading of the old prison, and faces the Great North Road,\r\nthe burial ground being at the bottom of the field behind it. Upon the\r\nmonument is inscribed:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In Memoriam. This column was erected A.D. 1914 to the memory of 1,770\r\nsoldiers and sailors, natives or allies of France, taken prisoners of\r\nwar during the Republican and Napoleonic wars with Great Britain, A.D.\r\n1793–1814, who died in the military dépôt at Norman Cross, which\r\nformerly stood near this spot, 1797–1814.\r\n\r\n                 Dulce et decorum est pro patriâ mori.\r\n\r\n                               Erected by\r\n\r\nThe Entente Cordiale Society and friends on the initiative of the late\r\nW. H. Sands, Esq., Honorary Secretary of the Society.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOne might expect to find at Yaxley Church, as in so many other places in\r\nEngland associated with the sojourn of war prisoners, epitaphs or\r\nregistry entries of officers who died on parole, but there are none. All\r\nthat Yaxley preserves of its old connexion with the war prison are the\r\nstone caps of the prison east gate piers, which now surmount the piers\r\nof the west churchyard entrance, and the tablet in the church to the\r\nmemory of Captain Draper, R.N., an agent of the prison, which is thus\r\nlettered:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Inscribed at the desire and the sole Expence of the French Prisoners of\r\nWar at Norman Cross, to the memory of Captain John Draper, R.N., who for\r\nthe last 18 months of his life was Agent to the Depôt; in testimony of\r\ntheir esteem and gratitude for his humane attention to their comforts\r\nduring that too short period. He died February 23rd, 1813, aged 53\r\nyears.’\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MEMORIAL TO FRENCH PRISONERS OF WAR WHO DIED AT NORMAN CROSS\r\n\r\n  Unveiled July 28, 1914\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Arthur Brown, in his little book _The French Prisoners of\r\nNorman Cross_, says that the prisoners asked to be represented at his\r\nfuneral, and that their petition concluded with the assurance that,\r\n_mauvais sujets_ as some of them were, not one would take advantage of\r\nthe liberty accorded them to attempt to escape. It is gratifying to know\r\nthat their request was granted. Other relics of the prisoners, in the\r\nshape of articles made by them for sale with the rudest of tools and the\r\ncommonest of materials, are tolerably abundant, although the choicest\r\nare to be seen in museums and private collections, notably those in the\r\nPeterborough Museum and in the possession of Mr. Dack, the curator.\r\nProbably no more varied and beautiful specimens of French prisoner work\r\nin wood, bone, straw, and grass, than these just mentioned, are to be\r\nfound in Britain.\r\n\r\nThe market at which these articles were sold was held daily from 10 a.m.\r\ntill noon, according to some accounts, twice a week according to others.\r\nIt was important enough, it is said, to have dwarfed that at\r\nPeterborough: as much as £200 was known to have been taken during a\r\nweek, and at one time the concourse of strangers at it was so great that\r\nan order was issued that in future nobody was to be admitted unless\r\naccompanied by a commissioned officer. Visitors were searched, and\r\nsevere penalties were imposed upon any one dealing in Government stores,\r\na Yaxley tradesman in whose possession were found palliasses and other\r\narticles marked with the broad arrow being fined heavily, condemned to\r\nstand in the pillory at Norman Cross, and imprisoned for two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1796 it became absolutely necessary that special\r\naccommodation should be provided for the ever-increasing number of\r\nprisoners of war brought to Britain. The hulks were full to congestion,\r\nthe other regular prisons,—such as they were,—the improvised prisons,\r\nand the hired houses, were crowded; disease was rife among the captives\r\non account of the impossibility of maintaining proper sanitation, and\r\nthe spirit of revolt was showing itself among men just then in the full\r\nflush of the influences of the French Revolution. Norman Cross was\r\nselected as the site of a prison which should hold 7,000 men, and it was\r\nwell chosen, being a tract of land forty acres in extent, healthily\r\nsituated on high ground, connected with the sea by water-ways via Lynn\r\nand Peterborough; and with London, seventy-eight miles distant, by the\r\nGreat North Road. Time pressed; buildings of stone or brick were not to\r\nbe thought of, so it was planned that all should be of wood, surrounded\r\nby a brick wall, but this last was not completed for some time after the\r\nopening of the prison. The skeletons of the prison blocks were framed\r\nand shaped in London, sent down, and in four months, that is to say in\r\nMarch 1797, the labour of 500 carpenters, working Sundays and week-days,\r\nrendered some of the blocks ready for habitation.\r\n\r\nThe first agent appointed was Mr. Delafons, but he only acted for a few\r\ndays previous to the arrival of Mr. James Perrot from Portchester, on\r\nApril 1, 1797. The superintendent of the transport of the prisoners was\r\nCaptain Daniel Woodriff, R.N.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 1797, Woodriff received notice and instructions about the\r\nfirst arrival of prisoners. On March 26 they came—934 in number—in\r\nbarges from Lynn to Yaxley, at the rate of 1_s._ 10_d._ per man, and\r\nvictualling at 7_d._ per man per day, the sustenance being one pound of\r\nbread or biscuit, and three quarters of a pound of beef.\r\n\r\nThe arrivals came in fast, so that between April 7 and May 18, 1797,\r\n3,383 prisoners (exclusive of seven dead and three who escaped), passed\r\nunder the care of the ten turnkeys and the eighty men of the Caithness\r\nLegion who guarded Norman Cross.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1.

(_Hill’s Plan_, 1797–1803.)\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nComplaints and troubles soon came to light. A prisoner in 1797, ‘who\r\nappeared above the common class of men’, complained that the bread and\r\nbeef were so bad that they were not fit for a prisoner’s dog to eat,\r\nthat the British Government was not acquainted with the treatment of the\r\nprisoners, and that this was the agent’s fault for not keeping a\r\nsufficiently strict eye upon his subordinates. This was confirmed, not\r\nonly by inquiry among the prisoners, but by the evidence of the petty\r\nofficers and soldiers of the garrison, who said ‘as fellow creatures\r\nthey must allow that the provisions given to the prisoners were not fit\r\nfor them to eat, and that the water they had was much better than the\r\nbeer’. In spite of this evidence, the samples sent up by the request of\r\nthe ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office in reply to this complaint, were pronounced\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIn July 1797 the civil officials at Norman Cross complained of\r\nannoyances, interferences, and insults from the military. Major-General\r\nBowyer, in command, in his reply stated: ‘I cannot conceive the civil\r\nofficers have a right to take prisoners out of their prisons to the\r\ncanteens and other places, which this day has been mentioned to me.’\r\n\r\nBy July 18 such parts of the prison as were completed were very full,\r\nand in November the buildings were finished, and the sixteen blocks,\r\neach holding 400 prisoners, were crowded. The packing of the hammocks in\r\nthese blocks was close, but not closer than in the men-of-war of the\r\nperiod, and not very much closer than in the machinery-crowded big ships\r\nof to-day. The blocks, or _casernes_ as they were called, measured 100\r\nfeet long by twenty-four feet broad, and were two stories high. On the\r\nground floor the hammocks were slung from posts three abreast, and there\r\nwere three tiers. In the upper story were only two tiers. As to the life\r\nat Norman Cross, it appears to me from the documentary evidence\r\navailable to have been more tolerable than at any of the other great\r\nprisons, if only from the fact that the place had been specially built\r\nfor its purpose, and was not, as in most other places, adapted. The food\r\nallowance was the same as elsewhere; viz., on five days of the week each\r\nprisoner had one and a half pounds of bread, half a pound of beef,\r\ngreens or pease or oatmeal, and salt. On Wednesday and Friday one pound\r\nof herrings or cod-fish was substituted for the beef, and beer could be\r\nbought at the canteen. The description by George Borrow in\r\n_Lavengro_—‘rations of carrion meat and bread from which I have seen the\r\nvery hounds occasionally turn away’, is now generally admitted to be as\r\ninaccurate as his other remarks concerning the Norman Cross which he\r\ncould only remember as a very small boy.\r\n\r\nThe outfit was the same as in other prisons, but I note that in the year\r\n1797 the store-keeper at Norman Cross was instructed to supply each\r\nprisoner _as often as was necessary_, and not, as elsewhere, at stated\r\nintervals, with one jacket, one pair of trousers, two pairs of\r\nstockings, two shirts, one pair of shoes, one cap, and one hammock. By\r\nthe way, the prisoners’ shoes are ordered ‘not to have long straps for\r\nbuckles, but short ears for strings’.\r\n\r\nOn August 8, 1798, Perrot writes from Stilton to Woodriff:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘If you remember, on returning from the barracks on Sunday, Captain\r\nLlewellin informed us that a report had been propagated that seven\r\nprisoners intended to escape that day, which we both looked upon as a\r\nmere report; they were counted both that night, but with little effect\r\nfrom the additions made to their numbers by the men you brought from\r\nLynn, and yesterday morning and afternoon, but in such confusion from\r\nthe prisoners refusing to answer, from others giving in fictitious\r\nnames, and others answering for two or three. In consequence of all\r\nthese irregularities I made all my clerks, a turnkey, and a file of\r\nsoldiers, go into the south east quadrangle this morning at five\r\no’clock, and muster each prison separately, and found that six prisoners\r\nfrom the Officers’ Prison have escaped, but can obtain none of their\r\nnames except Captain Dorfe, who some time ago applied to me for to\r\nobtain liberty for him to reside with his family at Ipswich where he had\r\nmarried an English wife. The officers remaining have separately and\r\nconjunctively refused to give the names of the other five, for which I\r\nhave ordered the whole to be put on half allowance to-morrow. After the\r\nmost diligent search we could only find one probable place where they\r\nhad escaped, by the end next the South Gate, by breaking one of the\r\nrails of the picket, but how they passed afterwards is a mystery still\r\nunravelled.’\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1797–8 there were many Dutch prisoners here, chiefly\r\ntaken at Camperdown.\r\n\r\nWilliam Prickard, of the Leicester Militia, was condemned to receive 500\r\nlashes for talking of escape with a prisoner.\r\n\r\nOn February 21, 1798, Mr. James Stewart of Peterborough thus wrote to\r\nCaptain Woodriff:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have received a heavy complaint from the prisoners of war of being\r\nbeat and otherwise ill-treated by the officials at the Prison. I can\r\nhave no doubt but that they exaggerate these complaints, for what they\r\ndescribe as a dungeon I have examined myself and find it to be a proper\r\nplace to confine unruly prisoners in, being above ground, and appears\r\nperfectly dry. How far you are authorized to chastise the prisoners of\r\nwar I cannot take upon me to determine, but I presume to think it should\r\nbe done sparingly and with temper. I was in hopes the new system\r\nadopted, with the additional allowance of provisions would have made the\r\nprisoners more easy and contented under their confinement, but it would\r\nappear it caused more turbulence and uneasiness.... That liquor is\r\nconveyed to the prisoners I have no doubt, you know some of the turnkeys\r\nhave been suspected.’\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo turnkeys were shortly afterwards dismissed for having conveyed large\r\nquantities of ale into the prison.\r\n\r\nRendered necessary by complaints from the neighbourhood, the following\r\norder was issued by the London authorities in 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Obscene figures and indecent toys and all such indecent representations\r\ntending to disseminate Lewdness and Immorality exposed for sale or\r\nprepared for that purpose are to be instantly destroyed.’\r\n\r\n\r\nConstant escapes made the separation of officers from men and the\r\nsuspension of all intercourse between them to be strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nPerrot died towards the end of 1798, and Woodriff was made agent in\r\nJanuary 1799. Soon after Woodriff’s assuming office the Mayor of Lynn\r\ncomplained of the number of prisoners at large in the town, and\r\nunguarded, waiting with Norman Cross passports for cartel ships to take\r\nthem to France. To appreciate this complaint we must remember that the\r\nrank and file, and not a few of the officers, of the French\r\nRevolutionary Army and Navy, who were prisoners of war in Britain, were\r\nof the lowest classes of society, desperate, lawless, religionless,\r\nunprincipled men who in confinement were a constant source of anxiety\r\nand watchfulness, and at large were positively dangers to society. If a\r\nbody of men like this got loose, as did fifteen on the night of April 5,\r\n1799, from Norman Cross, the fact was enough to carry terror throughout\r\na countryside.\r\n\r\nYet there was a request made this year from the Norman Cross prisoners\r\nthat they might have priests sent to them. At first the order was that\r\nnone should be admitted except to men dangerously ill, but later, Ruello\r\nand Vexier were permitted to reside in Number 8 Caserne, under the rule\r\n‘that your officers do strictly watch over their communication and\r\nconduct, lest, under pretence of religion, any stratagems or devices be\r\ncarried out to the public prejudice by people of whose disposition to\r\nabuse indulgence there have already existed but too many examples’.\r\n\r\nThat Captain Woodriff’s position was rendered one of grave anxiety and\r\nresponsibility by the bad character of many of the prisoners under his\r\ncharge is very clear from the continual tenor of the correspondence\r\nbetween him and the Transport Board. The old punishment of simple\r\nconfinement in the Black Hole being apparently quite useless, it was\r\nordered that offenders sentenced to the Black Hole should be put on half\r\nrations, and also lose their turn of exchange. This last was the\r\npunishment most dreaded by the majority of the prisoners, although there\r\nwas a regular market for these turns of exchange, varying from £40\r\nupwards, which would seem to show that to many a poor fellow, life at\r\nNorman Cross with some capital to gamble with was preferable to a return\r\nto France in exchange for a British prisoner of similar grade, only to\r\nbe pressed on board a man-of-war of the period, or to become a unit of\r\nthe hundreds and thousands of soldiers sent here and there to be maimed\r\nor slaughtered in a cause of which they knew little and cared less.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that these increased punishments were made law with\r\nthe concurrence, if not at the suggestion, of the French Agent, Niou,\r\nwho remarked with respect to the system of buying and selling turns of\r\nexchange, ‘. . . une conduite aussi lâche devant être arrêtée par tous\r\nles moyens possibles. Je viens en conséquence de mettre les Vendéens (I\r\nam inclined to regard ‘Vendéens’ as a mistake for ‘vendants’) à la queue\r\ndes échanges.’\r\n\r\nThe year 1799 seems to have been a disturbed one at Norman Cross. In\r\nAugust the prisoners showed their resentment at having detailed personal\r\ndescriptions of them taken, by disorderly meetings, the result being\r\nthat all trafficking between them was stopped, and the daily market at\r\nthe prison-gate suspended.\r\n\r\nStockdale, the Lynn manager of the prison traffic between the coast and\r\nNorman Cross, writes on one occasion that of 125 prisoners who had been\r\nstarted for the prison, ‘there were two made their escape, and one shot\r\non their march to Lynn, and I am afraid we lost two or three last\r\nnight ... there are some very artful men among them who will make their\r\nescape if possible’.\r\n\r\nAttempts to escape during the last stages of the journey from the coast\r\nto the prison were frequent. On February 4, 1808, the crews of two\r\nprivateers, under an escort of the 77th Regiment, were lodged for the\r\nnight in the stable of the _Angel Inn_ at Peterborough. One Simon tried\r\nto escape. The sentry challenged and fired. Simon was killed, and the\r\ncoroner’s jury brought in the verdict of ‘Justifiable homicide’.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a column of prisoners was crossing the Nene Bridge\r\nat Peterborough, when one of them broke from the ranks, and sprang into\r\nthe river. He was shot as he rose to the surface.\r\n\r\nOn account of the proximity of Norman Cross to a countryside of which\r\none of the staple industries was the straw manufacture, the prevention\r\nof the smuggling of straw into the prison for the purpose of being made\r\ninto bonnets, baskets, plaits, &c., constantly occupied the attention of\r\nthe authorities. In 1799 the following circular was sent by the\r\nTransport Board to all prisons and dépôts in the kingdom:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Being informed that the Revenues and Manufactures of this country are\r\nconsiderably injured by the extensive sale of Straw Hats made by the\r\nPrisoners of War in this country, we do hereby require and direct you to\r\npermit no Hat, Cap, or Bonnet manufactured by any of the Prisoners of\r\nWar in your custody, to be sold or sent out of the Prison in future,\r\nunder any pretence whatever, and to seize and destroy all such articles\r\nas may be detected in violation of this order.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThis traffic, however, was continued, for in 1807 the Transport Board,\r\nin reply to a complaint by a Mr. John Poynder to Lord Liverpool,\r\n‘requests the magistrates to help in stopping the traffic with prisoners\r\nof war in prohibited articles, straw hats and straw plait especially, as\r\nit has been the means of selling obscene toys, pictures, &c., to the\r\ngreat injury of the morals of the rising generation’.\r\n\r\nTo continue the prison record in order of dates: in 1801 the Transport\r\nBoard wrote to Otto, Commissioner in England of the French Republic,\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘SIR:\r\n\r\n‘Having directed Capt. Woodriff, Superintendant at Norman Cross Prison,\r\nto report to us on the subject of some complaints made by the prisoners\r\nat that place, he has informed me of a most pernicious habit among the\r\nprisoners which he has used every possible means to prevent, but without\r\nsuccess. Some of the men, whom he states to have been long confined\r\nwithout receiving any supplies from their friends, have only the prison\r\nallowance to subsist on, and this allowance he considers sufficient to\r\nnourish and keep in health if they received it daily, but he states this\r\nis not the case, although the full ration is regularly issued by the\r\nSteward to each mess of 12 men. There are in these prisons, he observes,\r\nsome men—if they deserve that name—who possess money with which they\r\npurchase of some unfortunate and unthinking fellow-prisoner his ration\r\nof bread for several days together, and frequently _both bread and beef\r\nfor a month_, which he, the merchant, seizes upon daily and sells it out\r\nagain to some other unfortunate being on the same usurious terms,\r\nallowing the former _one half-penny worth of potatoes daily_ to keep him\r\nalive. Not contented with this more than savage barbarity, he purchases\r\nnext his clothes and bedding, and sees the miserable man lie naked on\r\nhis plank unless he will consent to allow him one half-penny a night to\r\nlie in his own hammock, which he makes him pay by a further deprivation\r\nof his ration when his original debt is paid.... In consequence of this\r\nrepresentation we have directed Capt. Woodriff to keep a list of every\r\nman of this description of merchants above mentioned in order they may\r\nbe put at the bottom of the list of exchange.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this year a terrible epidemic carried off nearly 1,000 prisoners. The\r\nTransport Board’s Surveyor was sent down, and he reported that the\r\ngeneral condition of the prison was very bad, especially as regarded\r\nsanitation. The buildings were merely of fir-quartering, and\r\nweather-boarded on the outside, and without lining inside, the result\r\nbeing that the whole of the timbering was a network of holes bored by\r\nthe prisoners in order to get light inside. In the twelve solitary cells\r\nof the Black Hole there was no convenience whatever. The wells were only\r\nin tolerable condition. The ventilation of the French officers’ rooms\r\nwas very bad. The hospital was better than other parts of the prison.\r\nThe report notes that the carpenters, sawyers, and masons were\r\nprisoners, a fact at once constituting an element of uncertainty, if not\r\nof danger. In December 1801 Woodriff found it necessary to post up an\r\norder about shamming ill in order to be changed to better quarters:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ayant connaissance que nombre de prisonniers français recherchent\r\njournellement les moyens de se donner l’air aussi misérable que possible\r\ndans le dessein d’être envoyés à l’Hôpital ou au No. 13 par le\r\nchirurgien de visite, et que s’ils sont reçus, soit pour l’un ou\r\nl’autre, ils vendent de suite leurs effets (s’ils ne l’ont déjà fait\r\npour se faire recevoir) le Gouvernement done [_sic_] avis de nouveau\r\nqu’aucun prisonnier ne sera reçu pour l’Hôpital ou pour le No. 13 s’il\r\nne produit ses effets de Literie et les Hardes qu’il peut avoir reçu\r\ndernièrement.’\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerals Rochambeau and Boyer were paroled prisoners who seem to have\r\nstudied how to give the authorities as much trouble and annoyance as\r\npossible. The Transport Board, weary of granting them indulgences which\r\nthey abused, and of making them offers which they contemptuously\r\nrejected, clapped them into Norman Cross in September 1804. They were\r\nplaced in the wards of the military hospital, a sentinel at their doors,\r\nand no communication allowed between them, or their servants, and the\r\nrest of the prisoners. They were not allowed newspapers, no special\r\nallowance was made them of coals, candles, and wood, they were not\r\npermitted to go beyond the hospital airing ground, and Captain\r\nPressland, the then agent of the prison, was warned to be strictly on\r\nhis guard, and to watch them closely, despite his favourable remarks\r\nupon their deportment. It was at about this time that the alarm was\r\nwidespread that the prisoners of war in Britain were to co-operate with\r\nan invasion by their countrymen from without. General Boyer, at Tiverton\r\nin 1803, ‘whilst attentive to the ladies, did not omit to curse, even to\r\n_them_, his fate in being deprived of his arms, and without hope of\r\nbeing useful to his countrymen when they arrive in England’. Rochambeau\r\nat Norman Cross was even more ridiculous, for when he heard that\r\nBonaparte’s invasion was actually about to come off, he appeared for two\r\ndays in the airing ground in full uniform, booted and spurred. Later\r\nnews sent him into retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracts from contemporary newspapers show that the alarm was very\r\ngeneral. Said _The Times_:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The French prisoners on the prospect of an invasion of this country\r\nbegin to assume their Republican _fierté_; they tell their guards—“It is\r\nyour turn to guard us now, but before the winter is over it will be our\r\nturn to guard you.”\r\n\r\n‘The prisoners already in our hands, and those who may be added, will\r\noccasion infinite perplexity. The known licentiousness of their\r\nprinciples, the utter contempt of all laws of honour which is so\r\ngenerally prevalent among the French Republicans, and the audacity of\r\nexertions which may arise from a desire of co-operating with an invading\r\nforce, may render them extremely dangerous, especially if left in the\r\ncountry, where the thinness of the population prevents perpetual\r\ninspection and where alarm flies so rapidly as to double any mischief.’\r\n\r\n\r\nA suggestion was made that the prisoners should be concentrated in the\r\nprisons of London and neighbourhood, and some newspapers even echoed\r\nRobespierre’s truculent advice: ‘Make no prisoners.’\r\n\r\nIn 1804, in reply to another application that priests might reside\r\nwithin the prison boundaries, the authorities said:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘As to the French priests and the procurement of lodgings at Stilton, we\r\nhave nothing to do with them, but with respect to the proposal of their\r\ninhabitation in our Dépôts, we cannot possibly allow of such a measure\r\nat this critical time to _Foreigners of that equivocal description_.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ever-recurring question as to the exact lines of demarcation to be\r\ndrawn between the two chief men of the prison, the Agent and the\r\nCommander of the garrison, occupies a great deal of Departmental\r\nliterature. We have given one specimen already, and in 1804 Captain\r\nPressland was thus addressed by his masters in London:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘As the interior regulation and management of the Prison is entirely\r\nunder your direction, we do not see any necessity for returns being made\r\ndaily to the C.O. of the Guard, and we approve of your reason for\r\ndeclining to make such returns; but as, on the other hand, the C.O. is\r\nanswerable for the security of the Prison, it is not proper that you\r\nshould interfere in that respect any further than merely to suggest what\r\nmay appear to you to be necessary or proper to be done.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same year a serious charge was brought against Captain Pressland\r\nby the prisoners, that he was in the habit of deducting two and a half\r\nper cent from all sums passing through his hands for payment to the\r\nprisoners. He admitted having done so, and got off with a rebuke. It may\r\nbe mentioned here that the pay of a prison agent was thirty shillings\r\nper diem, the same as that of a junior post captain on sea fencible\r\nservice—quarters, but no allowances except £10 10_s._ per annum for\r\nstationery. In 1805 the boys’ building was put up. At first the\r\nsuggested site was on the old burial ground; but as it was urged that\r\nsuch a proceeding might produce much popular clamour, as well as ‘other\r\ndisagreeable consequences’, it was put outside the outer stockade, north\r\nof the Hospital. It is said that the boys were here brought up as\r\nmusicians by the Bishop of Moulins.\r\n\r\nAt this time escapes seem to have been very frequent, and this in spite\r\nof the frequent changing of the garrison, and the rule that no soldier\r\nknowing French should be on guard duty. All implements and edged tools\r\nwere taken from the prisoners, only one knife being allowed, which was\r\nto be returned every night, locked up in a box, and placed in the\r\nGuard-room until the next morning, and failure to give up knives meant\r\nthe Black Hole. Any prisoner attempting to escape was to be executed\r\nimmediately, but I find no record of this drastic sentence being carried\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nFrom _The Times_ of October 15, 1804, I take the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘An alarming spirit of insubordination was on Wednesday evinced by the\r\nFrench prisoners, about 3,000, at Norman Cross. An incessant uproar was\r\nkept up all the morning, and at noon their intention to attempt the\r\ndestruction of the barrier of the prison became so obvious that the C.O.\r\nat the Barrack, apprehensive that the force under his command,\r\nconsisting only of the Shropshire Militia and one battalion of the Army\r\nof reserve, would not be sufficient in case of necessity to environ and\r\nrestrain so large a body of prisoners, dispatched a messenger requiring\r\nthe assistance of the Volunteer force at Peterborough. Fortunately the\r\nYeomanry had had a field day, and one of the troops was undismissed when\r\nthe messenger arrived. The troops immediately galloped into the\r\nBarracks. In the evening a tumult still continuing among the prisoners,\r\nand some of them taking advantage of the extreme darkness to attempt to\r\nescape, further reinforcements were sent for and continued on duty all\r\nnight. The prisoners, having cut down a portion of the wood enclosure\r\nduring the night, nine of them escaped through the aperture. In another\r\npart of the prison, as soon as daylight broke, it was found that they\r\nhad undermined a distance of 34 feet towards the Great South Road, under\r\nthe fosse which surrounds the prison, although it is 4 feet deep, and it\r\nis not discovered they had any tools. Five of the prisoners have been\r\nre-taken.’\r\n\r\n\r\nA little later in the year, on a dark, stormy Saturday night, seven\r\nprisoners escaped through a hole they had cut in the wooden wall, and\r\nwere away all Sunday. At 8 p.m. on that day, a sergeant and a corporal\r\nof the Durham Militia, on their way north on furlough, heard men talking\r\na ‘foreign lingo’ near Whitewater toll-bar. Suspecting them to be\r\nescaped prisoners, they attacked and secured two of them, but five got\r\noff. On Monday two of these were caught near Ryall toll-bar in a state\r\nof semi-starvation, having hidden in Uffington Thicket for twenty-four\r\nhours; the other three escaped.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult tasks which faced the agents of prisons in\r\ngeneral, and of Norman Cross in particular, was the checking of\r\ncontraband traffic between the prisoners and outsiders. At Norman Cross,\r\nas I have said, the chief illicit trade was in straw-plaiting work.\r\nStrange to say, although the interests of the poor country people were\r\nseverely injured by this trade, the wealth and influence of the chief\r\ndealers were so great that it was difficult to get juries to convict,\r\nand when they did convict, to get judges to pass deterrent sentences. In\r\n1807, for instance, legal opinion was actually given that a publican\r\ncould not have his licence refused because he had carried on the\r\nstraw-plait traffic with the prisoners, although it was an open secret\r\nthat the innkeepers of Stilton, Wansford, Whittlesea, Peterborough, and\r\neven the landlord of the inn which in those days stood opposite where\r\nnow is the present Norman Cross Hotel, were deeply engaged in it.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, ‘from motives of humanity’, the prisoners at Norman Cross were\r\nallowed to make baskets, boxes, ornaments, &c., of straw, if the\r\nstraw-plaiting traffic could be effectually prevented. The manufacture\r\nof these articles, which were often works of the most refined beauty and\r\ndelicacy, of course did not harm the poor, rough straw-plaiters of\r\nBedfordshire and Northamptonshire; but the radius of its sale was\r\nlimited, the straw-plaiting meant quick and good returns, and the\r\ndifficulty to be faced by the authorities was to ensure the rightful use\r\nof the straw introduced. In 1808 there were many courts-martial upon\r\nsoldiers of the garrison for being implicated in this traffic, and in\r\neach case the soldier was severely flogged and the straw bonnet ordered\r\nto be burned. It was no doubt one of these episodes which so aroused\r\nGeorge Borrows ire.[4] The guard of the coach from Lincoln to Stilton\r\nwas put under observation by order of the Transport Office, being\r\nsuspected of assisting people to carry the straw plait made in the\r\nprison to Baldock to be made into bonnets.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Pressland writes thus seriously to the Transport Office:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘That every step that could possibly be taken by General Williams\r\n[Commander of the Garrison] and myself to prevent this illicit Traffic\r\n[has been taken], the Board will, I trust, readily admit, and I am well\r\nconvinced that without the prosecution of those dealers who are\r\nparticularized in the documents forwarded by the Lincoln coach this\r\nevening, it will ever continue, to the great injury of the country in\r\ngeneral; for already eight or nine soldiers have deserted from a dread\r\nof punishment, having been detected by those whom they knew would inform\r\nagainst them, and I shall leave the Board to judge how far the\r\ndiscipline of the Regiments has been hurt, and the Soldiers seduced from\r\ntheir duty by the bribes they are constantly receiving from Barnes,\r\nLunn, and Browne. It now becomes a serious and alarming case, for if\r\nthese persons can with so much facility convey into the Prison sacks of\r\n5 and 6 feet in length, they might convey weapons of every description\r\nto annoy those whose charge they are under, to the great detriment of\r\nH.M.’s service, and the lives of His subjects most probably.’\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COLOURED STRAW WORK-BOX\r\n\r\n  Made by French prisoners of war\r\n]\r\n\r\nA large bundle of documents contains the trial of Barnes, Lunn, Browne,\r\nand others, for, in conjunction with bribed soldiers of the garrison,\r\ntaking straw into the prison and receiving the plaited article in\r\nexchange. The evidence of soldiers of the guard showed that James,\r\nostler at the _Bell_, Stilton, had been seen many times at midnight\r\nthrowing sacks of straw over the palisades, and receiving straw plait in\r\nreturn, and also bonnets, and that he was always assisted by soldiers.\r\nBarnes had said that he would get straw into the prison in spite of\r\nGeneral Williams or anybody else, as he had bought five fields of wheat\r\nfor the purpose. He was acting for his brother, a Baldock straw-dealer.\r\n\r\nThe trial came off at Huntingdon on March 20, 1811, the result being\r\nthat Lunn got twelve months, and the others six months each. It may be\r\nnoted here that so profitable for dealers was this contraband trade in\r\nwar-prison manufactured straw articles, that a Bedfordshire man, Matthew\r\nWingrave, found it to be worth his while to buy up wheat and barley land\r\nin the neighbourhood of the great Scottish dépôt at Valleyfield, near\r\nPenicuik, and carry on business there.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the resentment aroused by this judgement among those\r\ninterested in the illicit trade, a Sergeant Ives of the West Essex\r\nMilitia, who had been especially active in the suppression of the\r\nstraw-plait business, was, according to the _Taunton Courier_, stopped\r\nbetween Stilton and Norman Cross by a number of fellows, who, after\r\nknocking him down and robbing him of his watch and money, forced open\r\nhis jaws with savage ferocity and cut off a piece of his tongue.\r\n\r\nIn November 1807 a brick wall was built round Norman Cross prison; the\r\nouter palisade which it replaced being used to repair the inner.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Flaigneau, a prisoner, was tried at Huntingdon for murdering a\r\nturnkey. The trial lasted six hours, but in spite of the instructions of\r\nthe judge, the jury brought him in _Not Guilty_.\r\n\r\nForgery and murder brought the prisoners under the Civil Law. Thus in\r\n1805 Nicholas Deschamps and Jean Roubillard were tried at Huntingdon\r\nSummer Assizes for forging £1 bank notes, which they had done most\r\nskilfully. They were sentenced to death, but were respited during His\r\nMajesty’s pleasure, and remained in Huntingdon gaol for nine years,\r\nuntil they were pardoned and sent back to France in 1814.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Stamford Mercury_ of September 16, 1808, I take the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Early on Friday morning last Charles François Maria Boucher, a French\r\nofficer, a prisoner of war in this country, was conveyed from the County\r\nGaol at Huntingdon to Yaxley Barracks where he was hanged, agreeable to\r\nhis sentence at the last assizes, for stabbing with a knife, with intent\r\nto kill Alexander Halliday, in order to effect his escape from that\r\nprison. The whole garrison was under arms and all the prisoners in the\r\ndifferent apartments were made witnesses of the impressive scene.’\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall deal later in detail with the subject of prisoners on parole, so\r\nthat it suffices here to say that every care was taken to avoid the just\r\nreproach of the earlier years of the great wars that officer prisoners\r\nof war in England were promiscuously herded on hulks and in prisons with\r\nthe rank and file, and it was an important part of Prison Agent’s duties\r\nto examine each fresh arrival of prisoners with a view to selecting\r\nthose of character and the required rank qualifying them for the\r\nprivileges of being allowed on parole in certain towns and villages set\r\napart for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 about 100 Norman Cross prisoners were out on parole in\r\nPeterborough and the neighbourhood. The _Wheatsheaf_ at Stibbington was\r\na favourite house of call with the parole prisoners, says the Rev. A.\r\nBrown in the before-quoted book, and this, when afterwards a farmhouse,\r\nbelonged to an old man, born before the close of the war, who told Dr.\r\nWalker that as a child he had often seen the prisoners regale themselves\r\nhere with the excellent cooking of his grandmother, the milestone which\r\nwas their limit from Wansford, where they lodged, being just outside the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe parole officers seem to have been generally received with kindness\r\nand hospitality by the neighbouring gentry, and a few marriages with\r\nEnglish girls are recorded, although when it became known that such\r\nunions were not recognized as binding by the French Government, and that\r\neven the English wives of Frenchmen were sent back from Morlaix, the\r\ncartel port, the English girls became more careful. Some of the gentry,\r\nindeed, seem to have interested themselves too deeply in the exiles, and\r\nin 1801 the Transport Office requests the attention of its Agent ‘to the\r\npractices of a person of some property near Peterborough, similar to\r\nthose for which Askew was convicted at the Huntingdon Assizes’—which was\r\nfor aiding prisoners to escape.\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of Paris, May 30, 1814, Peace was declared between France\r\nand Britain, and in the same month 4,617 French prisoners at Norman\r\nCross were sent home via Peterborough and Lynn unguarded, but the prison\r\nwas not finally evacuated until August. It was never again used as a\r\nprison, but was pulled down and sold.\r\n\r\nWe have already become acquainted with General Pillet as a rabid\r\nchronicler of life on the Chatham hulks; we shall meet him again out on\r\nparole, and now let us hear what he has to say about Norman Cross in his\r\nbook on England.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have seen at Norman Cross a plot of land where nearly four thousand\r\nmen, out of seven thousand in this prison, were buried. Provisions were\r\nthen dear in England, and our Government, it was said, had refused to\r\npay the balance of an account due for prisoners. To settle this account\r\nall the prisoners were put on half-rations, and to make sure that they\r\nshould die, the introduction of food for sale, according to custom, was\r\nforbidden. To reduced quantity was added inferior quality of the\r\nprovisions served out. There was distributed four times a week,\r\nworm-eaten biscuit, fish and salt meat; three times a week black, half\r\nbaked bread made of mouldy flour or of black wheat. Soon after eating\r\nthis one was seized with a sort of drunkenness, followed by violent\r\nheadache, diarrhoea, and redness of face; many died from a sort of\r\nvertigo. For vegetables, uncooked beans were served up. In fact,\r\nhundreds of men sank each day, starved to death, or poisoned by the\r\nprovisions. Those who did not die immediately, became so weak that\r\ngradually they could digest nothing.’ (Then follow some details, too\r\ndisgusting to be given a place here, of the extremities to which\r\nprisoners at Norman Cross were driven by hunger.) ‘Hunger knows no\r\nrules. The corpses of those who died were kept for five or six days\r\nwithout being given up by their comrades, who by this means received the\r\ndead men’s rations.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThis veracious chronicler continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I myself took a complaint to Captain Pressland. Next day, the officers\r\nof the two militia battalions on guard at the prison, and some\r\ncivilians, arrived just at the moment for the distribution of the\r\nrations. At their head was Pressland who was damning the prisoners\r\nloudly. The rations were shown, and, as the whole thing had been\r\nrehearsed beforehand, they were good. A report was drawn up by which it\r\nwas shown that the prisoners were discontented rascals who grumbled at\r\neverything, that the food was unexceptionable, and that some of the\r\ngrumblers deserved to be shot, for an example. Next day the food was\r\njust as bad as ever.... Certainly the prisoners had the chance of buying\r\nprovisions for themselves from the wives of the soldiers of the garrison\r\ntwice a week. But these women, bribed to ruin the prisoners, rarely\r\nbrought what was required, made the prisoners take what they brought,\r\nand charged exorbitant prices, and, as payment had to be made in\r\nadvance, they settled things just as they chose.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWith reference to the medical attendance at Norman Cross, Pillet says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have been witness and victim, as prisoner of war, of the false oath\r\ntaken by the doctors at Norman Cross. They were supplied with medicines,\r\nflannel, cotton stuffs, &c., in proportion to the number of prisoners,\r\nfor compresses, bandages, and so forth. When the supply was exhausted,\r\nthe doctor, in order to get a fresh supply, drew up his account of\r\nusage, and swore before a jury that this account was exact. The wife of\r\nthe doctor at Norman Cross, like that of the doctor of the _Crown\r\nPrince_ at Chatham, wore no petticoats which were not made of cotton and\r\nflannel taken from the prison stores. So with the medicines and drugs.\r\nThe contractor found the supply ample, and that there was no necessity\r\nto replace it, so he shared with the doctor and the apothecary the cost\r\nof what he had never delivered, although in the accounts it appeared\r\nthat he had renewed their supplies.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWith George Borrow’s description in _Lavengro_ of the brutalities\r\nexercised upon the prisoners at Norman Cross by the soldiers of the\r\ngarrison, many readers will be familiar. As the recollection is of his\r\nearly boyhood, it may be valued accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 a tourist among the churches of this part of East Anglia remarks\r\nupon the good appearance of the Norman Cross prisoners, particularly of\r\nthe boys—the drummers and the ‘mousses’. He adds that many of the\r\nprisoners had learned English enough ‘to chatter and to cheat’, and that\r\nsome of them upon release took away with them from two to three hundred\r\npounds as the proceeds of the sale of their handiwork in drawings, wood,\r\nbone and straw work, chessmen, draughts, backgammon boards, dice, and\r\ngroups in wood and bone of all descriptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE BLOCK HOUSE, NORMAN CROSS, 1809\r\n\r\n  _From a sketch by Captain George Lloyd_\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1814 came Peace. The following extracts from contemporary newspapers\r\nmade by Mr. Charles Dack, Curator of the Peterborough Museum, refer to\r\nthe process of evacuation, Norman Cross Dépôt being also known as\r\nStilton or Yaxley Barracks.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘11th April, 1814. The joy produced amongst the prisoners of war at\r\nNorman Cross by the change of affairs in France (the abdication of\r\nBonaparte) is quite indescribable and extravagant. A large white flag is\r\nset up in each of the quadrangles of the dépôt, under which the\r\nthousands of poor fellows, who have been for years in confinement,\r\ndance, sing, laugh, and cry for joy, with rapturous delight.\r\n\r\n‘5th May, 1814. The prisoners at Stilton Barracks are so elated at the\r\nidea of being so soon liberated, that they are all bent on selling their\r\nstock, which they do rapidly at 50 per cent advanced prices. Many of\r\nthem have realized fortunes of from £500 to £1,000 each.\r\n\r\n‘June 9th, Lynn. Upwards of 1,400 French prisoners of war have arrived\r\nin this town during the last week from Stilton Barracks, to embark for\r\nthe coast of France. Dunkirk, we believe, is the place of their\r\ndestination. In consequence of the wind having been hitherto\r\nunfavourable, they have been prevented from sailing, and we are glad to\r\nstate that their conduct in this town has hitherto been very orderly;\r\nand although they are continually perambulating the street, and some of\r\nthem indulging in tolerable libations of ale, we have not heard of a\r\nsingle act of indecorum taking place in consequence.’\r\n\r\n\r\nTo these notes the late Rev. G. N. Godwin, to whom I am indebted for\r\nmany details of life at Norman Cross, added in the columns of the\r\n_Norwich Mercury_:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The garrison of the dépôt caught the infection of wild joy, and a party\r\nof them seized the Glasgow mail coach on its arrival at Stilton, and\r\ndrew it to Norman Cross, whither the horses, coachman and guard were\r\nobliged to follow. The prisoners were so elated at the prospect of being\r\nliberated that they ceased to perform any work. Many of them had\r\nrealized fortunes of £500 to £1,000 each in Bank of England notes.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Cambridge Chronicle_ gives a pleasant picture on May 6th: ‘About\r\n200 prisoners from Norman Cross Barracks marched into this town on\r\nSunday last ... they walked about the town and ‘Varsity and conducted\r\nthemselves in an orderly manner.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it was rumoured that the buildings at Norman Cross were to be\r\nutilized, after the departure of the war prisoners, as a barrack for\r\nartillery and cavalry, this did not come about. The buildings were sold\r\nin lots; in Peterborough some of them were re-erected and still exist,\r\nand a pair of slatted gates are now barn-doors at Alwalton Rectory Farm,\r\nbut the very memories of this great prison are fast dying out in this\r\nage of the migration of the countryman.\r\n\r\nOn October 2, 1818, the sale of Norman Cross Barracks began, and lasted\r\nnine days, the sum realized being about £10,000. A curious comment upon\r\nthe condition of the prison is presented by the fact that a house built\r\nfrom some of it became known as ‘Bug Hall’, which has a parallel in the\r\ncase of Portchester Castle; some cottages built from the timber of the\r\n_casernes_ there, when it ceased to be a war prison, being still known\r\nas ‘Bug Row’.\r\n\r\nIn Shelley Row, Cambridge, is an ancient timbered barn which is known to\r\nhave been regularly used as a night-shelter for prisoners on their way\r\nto Norman Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                                3. PERTH\r\n\r\nThe following particulars about the great Dépôt at Perth are largely\r\ntaken from Mr. W. Sievwright’s book, now out of print and obtainable\r\nwith difficulty.[5] Mr. P. Baxter of Perth, however, transcribed it for\r\nme from the copy in the Perth Museum, and to him my best thanks are due.\r\n\r\nThe Dépôt at Perth was completed in 1812. It was constructed to hold\r\nabout 7,000 prisoners, and consisted of five three-story buildings, each\r\n130 feet long and 30 feet broad, with outside stairs, each with a\r\nseparate iron palisaded airing-ground and all converging upon what was\r\nknown as the ‘Market Place’. Each of these blocks held 1,140 prisoners.\r\nSouth of the great square was a building for petty officers,\r\naccommodating 1,100, and north of it the hospital for 150 invalids. Both\r\nof these latter buildings are still standing, having been incorporated\r\nwith the present General Prison. The sleeping quarters were very\r\ncrowded; so much so, says Sievwright, that the prisoners had to sleep\r\n‘spoon fashion’, (as we have seen on the prison ships), the turning-over\r\nprocess having to be done by whole ranks in obedience to words of\r\ncommand; ‘Attention! Squad number so and so! Prepare to spoon! One! Two!\r\nSpoon!’\r\n\r\nAround the entire space was a deep moat, ten feet broad; beyond this an\r\niron palisade; beyond this a wall twelve feet six inches high, with a\r\nsentry-walk round it. Three or four regiments of Militia were always\r\nkept in Perth for guard duties, which occupied 300 men. Many acres of\r\npotatoes were planted outside the prison. When peace was finally made,\r\nand the prison was emptied, the owners of these profitable acres were in\r\ndespair, until one of them discovered the London market, and this has\r\nbeen kept ever since.\r\n\r\nThe first prisoners came from Plymouth via Dundee in August 1812. They\r\nhad been lodged the first night in the church of Inchtore.[6] ‘During\r\nthe night’, says Penny in his _Traditions of Perth_, ‘the French\r\nprisoners found means to extract the brass nails and purloin the green\r\ncloth from the pulpit and seats in the Church, with every other thing\r\nthey could lay their hands on.’ Penny seems to have exaggerated. One\r\nprisoner stole a couple of ‘mort cloths’. This so enraged his fellows\r\nthat they tried him by court martial, and sentenced him to twenty-four\r\nlashes. He got seventeen there and then, but fainted, and the remainder\r\nwere given him later.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were 400 in number, and had some women with them, and were\r\nin tolerably good condition. A great many came in after Salamanca. They\r\nhad been marched through Fifeshire in very bad weather. ‘The poor\r\ncreatures, many of them half naked, were in a miserable plight; numbers\r\nof them gave up upon the road, and were flung into carts, one above the\r\nother, and when the carts were full, and capable of holding no more, the\r\nothers were tied to the backs with ropes and dragged along.’\r\n\r\nKirkcaldy on the Forth was the chief port for landing the prisoners;\r\nfrom Kirkcaldy they were marched overland to Perth.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at escape from the new Dépôt was made in September\r\n1812, there being at this time about 4,000 prisoners there. A prisoner\r\nslipped past the turnkey as the latter was opening a door in the iron\r\npalisading, and got away. The alarm was given; the prisoner had got to\r\nFriarton Toll, half a mile away, but being closely pursued was captured\r\nin a wheat field.\r\n\r\nOne Petite in this year was a slippery customer. He got out of Perth but\r\nwas recaptured, and lodged at Montrose on the march back to gaol. Thence\r\nhe escaped by unscrewing the locks of three doors, but was again caught\r\nat Ruthven print-field, and safely lodged in his old quarters in Perth\r\ngaol. Shortly after he was ordered to be transferred to Valleyfield, and\r\na sergeant and eight men were considered necessary to escort him. They\r\ngot him safely as far as Kirkcaldy, where they halted, and M. Petite was\r\nlodged for the night in the local prison; but when they came for him in\r\nthe morning, he was not to be found, and was never heard of again!\r\n\r\nHere Sievwright introduces a story from Penny, of date previous to the\r\nDépôt.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘On April 20th, 1811, it was reputed at the Perth Barracks that four\r\nFrench prisoners had passed through Perth. A detachment of soldiers who\r\nwere sent in pursuit on the road to Dundee, found, not those they were\r\nseeking, but four others, whom they conveyed to Perth and lodged in\r\ngaol. On the morning of April 24th, they managed to effect their escape.\r\nBy cutting some planks out of the partition of their apartment, they\r\nmade their way to the Court Room, from the window of which they\r\ndescended to the street. On their table was found a letter expressing\r\ntheir gratitude to the magistrates and inhabitants of Perth for the\r\ncivilities they had received, and promising a return of the kindness to\r\nany Scotsman whom they might find among the British prisoners in\r\nFrance.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a supplement to this, it is recorded that two of the original quarry\r\nwere afterwards captured, but were released unconditionally later on,\r\nwhen one of them proved that he had humanely treated General Walker,\r\nwhen the latter was lying seriously wounded at Badajos, saved him from\r\nbeing dispatched by a furious grenadier, and had him removed to a\r\nhospital. The General gave him his name and address, and promised to\r\nhelp him should occasion arise.\r\n\r\nIn January 1813 three prisoners got off in a thick fog and made their\r\nway as far as Broughty Ferry on the Forth. On their way, it came out\r\nlater, they stopped in Dundee for refreshment without any apparent dread\r\nof disturbance, and were later seen on the Fort hill near Broughty\r\nFerry. In the evening they entered a shop, bought up all the bread in it\r\nand had a leather bottle filled with spirits. At nine the same evening\r\nthey boarded Mr. Grubb’s ship _Nancy_, and immediately got under weigh\r\nunnoticed. The _Nancy_ was of fifteen tons burden, and was known to be\r\nprovisioned for ten days, as she was going to start the next morning on\r\nan excursion. The prisoners escaped, and a woman and two Renfrewshire\r\nMilitiamen were detained in prison after examination upon suspicion of\r\nhaving concealed and aided the prisoners with information about the\r\n_Nancy_ which they could hardly have obtained ordinarily.\r\n\r\nThis was on Thursday, January 21. On the night of Monday, 18th, a mason\r\nat the Dépôt, on his way from Newburgh to Perth, was stopped by three\r\nmen at the Coates of Fingask on the Rhynd road, and robbed of £1 18_s._\r\n6_d._ The robbers had the appearance of farm servants, but it seems\r\nquite likely that they were the daring and successful abductors of the\r\n_Nancy_.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 1813, there were 6,788 prisoners at the Dépôt. On the\r\nevening of February 22, 1813, seven prisoners bribed a sentinel to let\r\nthem escape. He agreed, but at once gave information, and was instructed\r\nto keep up the deception. So, at the fixed hour the prisoners, awaiting\r\nwith confident excitement the arrival of their deliverer, were, instead,\r\nfound hiding with scaling-ladders, ropes, and all implements necessary\r\nfor escape upon them, and a considerable sum of money for their needs.\r\nThey were at once conveyed to the punishment cells under the central\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nAt Perth, as elsewhere, the prisoners were allowed to amuse themselves,\r\nand to interest themselves in the manufacture of various knick-knacks,\r\ntoys, boxes, and puzzles, from wood, and the bones of their beef; of\r\nthese they made a great variety, and many of them are masterpieces of\r\ncunning deftness, and wonderfully beautiful in delicacy and perfection\r\nof workmanship. They made straw plait, a manufacture then in its infancy\r\nin this country; numbers made shoes out of bits of cloth, cutting up\r\ntheir clothes for the purpose, and it is possible that their hammocks\r\nmay have yielded the straw. It is said that after a time straw plait and\r\nshoes were prohibited as traffic. Some of the prisoners dug clay out of\r\ntheir court-yards and modelled figures of smugglers, soldiers, sailors,\r\nand women. The prisoners had the privilege of holding a market daily, to\r\nwhich the public were admitted provided they carried no contraband\r\narticles. Potatoes, vegetables, bread, soap, tobacco, and firewood, were\r\nall admitted. Large numbers of the inhabitants went daily to view the\r\nmarkets, and make purchases. The prisoners had stands set out all round\r\nthe railing of the yards, on which their wares were placed. Many paid\r\nhigh prices for the articles. While some of the prisoners were busy\r\nselling, others were occupied in buying provisions, vegetables and other\r\nnecessaries of food. Some of the prisoners played the flute, fiddle, and\r\nother instruments, for halfpence; Punch’s opera and other puppet shows\r\nwere also got up in fine style. Some were industrious and saving; others\r\ngambled and squandered the clothes from their bodies, and wandered about\r\nwith only a bit of blanket tied round them.\r\n\r\nFrom Penny’s _Traditions of Perth_ comes the following market trick:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘As much straw plait as made a bonnet was sold for four shillings, and,\r\nbeing exceedingly neat, it was much inquired after. In this trade many a\r\none got a bite, for the straw was all made up in parcels, and for fear\r\nof detection smuggled into the pockets of the purchasers.\r\n\r\n‘An unsuspecting man having been induced by his wife to purchase a\r\nquantity of straw plait for a bonnet, he attended the market and soon\r\nfound a seller. He paid the money, but, lest he should be observed, he\r\nturned his back on the prisoner, and got the things slipped into his\r\nhand, and thence into his pocket. Away he went with his parcel, well\r\npleased that he had escaped detection (for outsiders found buying straw\r\nplait were severely dealt with by the law), and on his way home he\r\nthought he would examine his purchase, when, to his astonishment and no\r\ndoubt to his deep mortification, he found instead of straw plait, a\r\nbundle of shavings very neatly tied up. The man instantly returned, and\r\ntold of the deception, and insisted on getting back his money. But the\r\nprisoner from whom the purchase had been made could not be seen. Whilst\r\ntrying to get a glimpse of his seller, he was told that if he did not go\r\naway he would be informed against, and fined for buying the supposed\r\nstraw plait. He was retiring when another prisoner came forward and said\r\nhe would find the other, and make him take back the shavings and return\r\nthe money. Pretending deep commiseration, the second prisoner said he\r\nhad no change, but if the straw plait buyer would give him sixteen\r\nshillings, he would give him a one pound note, and take his chance of\r\nthe man returning the money. The dupe gave the money and took the\r\nnote—which was a forgery on a Perth Bank.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAttempts to escape were almost a weekly occurrence, and some of them\r\nexhibited very notable ingenuity, patience, and daring. On March 26,\r\n1813, the discovery was made of a subterranean excavation from the\r\nlatrine of No. 2 Prison, forty-two feet long, and so near the base of\r\nthe outer wall that another hour’s work would have finished it.\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 1813, was found a pit twenty feet deep in the floor of No. 2\r\nPrison, with a lateral cut at about six feet from the bottom. The space\r\nbelow this cut was to receive water, and the cut was to pass obliquely\r\nupwards to allow water to run down. A prisoner in hospital was suspected\r\nby the others of giving information about this, and when he was\r\ndischarged he was violently assaulted, the intention being to cut off\r\nhis ears. He resisted, however, so that only one was taken off. Then a\r\nrope was fastened to him, and he was dragged through the moat while men\r\njumped on him. He was rescued just in time by a Durham Militiaman.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of the same month three prisoners got with false keys into\r\nan empty cellar under the central tower. They had provided themselves\r\nwith ordinary civilian attire which they intended to slip over their\r\nprison clothes, and mix with the market crowd. They were discovered by a\r\nman going into the cellar to examine the water pipes. Had they succeeded\r\na great many more would have followed.\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 1813, some prisoners promised a big bribe to a soldier of the\r\nDurham Militia if he would help them to escape. He pretended to accede,\r\nbut promptly informed his superiors, who told him to keep up the\r\ndelusion. So he allowed six prisoners to get over the outer wall by a\r\nrope ladder which they had made. Four were out and two were on the\r\nburial ground which was between the north boundary wall and the Cow\r\nInch, when they were captured by a party of soldiers who had been posted\r\nthere. The other two were caught in a dry ditch. They were all lodged in\r\nthe _cachot_. It was well for the ‘faithful Durham’, for the doubloons\r\nhe got were only three-shilling pieces, and the bank notes were\r\nforgeries!\r\n\r\nIn June three men escaped by breaking the bar of a window, and dropping\r\ntherefrom by a rope ladder. One of them who had got on board a neutral\r\nvessel at Dundee ventured ashore and was captured; one got as far as\r\nMontrose, but was recognized; of the fate of the third we do not hear.\r\n\r\nA duel took place between two officers with sharpened foils. The\r\nstrictest punctilio was observed at the affair, and after one had badly\r\nwounded the other, hands were shaken, and honour satisfied.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a clerk in the Dépôt was suspended for attempting to\r\nintroduce a profligate woman into the prison.\r\n\r\nThe usual market was prohibited on Midsummer market day, 1813, and the\r\npublic were excluded, as it was feared that the extraordinary concourse\r\nof people would afford opportunities for the prisoners to escape by\r\nmixing with them in disguise.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Report of July 1813 states that out of 7,000 prisoners there\r\nwere only twenty-four sick, including convalescents, and of these only\r\nfour were confined to their beds.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, 1813, the prisoners were not only allowed to celebrate the\r\nEmperor’s birthday, but the public were apprised of the fête and invited\r\nto attend a balloon ascent. The crowd duly assembled on the South Inch,\r\nbut the balloon was accidentally burst. There were illuminations of the\r\nprisons at night, and some of the transparencies, says the chronicler,\r\nshowed much taste and ingenuity. Advantage was taken of the excitement\r\nof this gala day to hurry on one of the most daring and ingenious\r\nattempts to escape in the history of the prison. On the morning of\r\nAugust 24 it was notified that a number of prisoners had escaped through\r\na mine dug from the latrine of No. 2 prison to the bottom of the\r\nsouthern outer wall. It was supposed that they must have begun to get\r\nout at 2 a.m. that day, but one of them, attempting to jump the ‘lade’,\r\nfell into the water with noise enough to alarm the nearest sentry, who\r\nfired in the direction of the sound. The alarm thus started was carried\r\non by the other sentries, and it was found that no fewer than\r\ntwenty-three prisoners had got away. Ten of them were soon caught. Two\r\nwho had got on board a vessel on the Perth shore were turned off by the\r\nmaster. One climbed up a tree and was discovered. One made an attempt to\r\nswim the Tay, but had to give up from exhaustion, and others were\r\ncaptured near the river, which, being swollen by recent rains, they had\r\nbeen unable to cross; and thirteen temporarily got away.\r\n\r\nOf these the _Caledonian Mercury_ wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Four of the prisoners who lately escaped from the Perth Dépôt were\r\ndiscovered within a mile of Arbroath on August 28th by a seaman\r\nbelonging to the Custom House yacht stationed there, who procured the\r\nassistance of some labourers, and attempted to apprehend them, upon\r\nwhich they drew their knives and threatened to stab any one who lay\r\n[_sic_] hold of them, but on the arrival of a recruiting party and other\r\nassistance the Frenchmen submitted. They stated that on Thursday\r\nnight—(they had escaped on Tuesday morning) they were on board of a\r\nvessel at Dundee, but which they were unable to carry off on account of\r\na neap tide which prevented her floating; other three or four prisoners\r\nhad been apprehended and lodged in Forfar Gaol. It has been ascertained\r\nthat several others had gone Northwards by the Highland Road in the\r\ndirection of Inverness.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four poor fellows in Forfar Jail made yet another bold bid for\r\nliberty. By breaking through the prison wall, they succeeded in making a\r\nhole to the outside nearly large enough for their egress before they\r\nwere discovered. The only tool they had was a part of the fire-grate\r\nwhich they had wrenched in pieces. Their time was well chosen for\r\ngetting out to sea, for it was nearly high water when they were\r\ndiscovered. Two others were captured near Blair Atholl, some thirty\r\nmiles north of Perth, and were brought back to the Dépôt.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief allusion has been made to the remarkable healthiness of the\r\nprisoners at Perth. The London papers of 1813 lauded Portchester and\r\nPortsmouth as examples of sanitary well-being to other prisoner\r\ndistricts, and quoted the statistics that, out of 20,680 prisoners\r\nthere, only 154 were on the sick list, but the average at Perth was\r\nstill better. On August 26, 1813, there were 7,000 prisoners at Perth,\r\nof whom only fourteen were sick. On October 28, out of the same number,\r\nonly ten were sick; and on February 3, 1814, when the weather was very\r\nsevere, there was not one man in bed.\r\n\r\nThe forgery of bank notes and the manufacture of base coin was pursued\r\nas largely and as successfully at Perth as elsewhere. In the _Perth\r\nCourier_ of September 19, 1813, we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We are sorry to learn that the forgery of notes of various banks is\r\ncarried on by prisoners at the Dépôt, and that they find means to throw\r\nthem into circulation by the assistance of profligate people who\r\nfrequent the market. The eagerness of the prisoners to obtain cash is\r\nvery great, and as they retain all they procure, they have drained the\r\nplace almost entirely of silver so that it has become a matter of\r\ndifficulty to get change of a note.... Last week a woman coming from the\r\nMarket at the Dépôt was searched by an order of Captain Moriarty, when\r\nthere was found about her person pieces of base money in imitation of\r\nBank tokens (of which the prisoners are suspected to have been the\r\nfabricators), to the amount of £5 17_s._ After undergoing examination,\r\nthe woman was committed to gaol.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was publicly announced on September 16, 1813, that a mine had been\r\ndiscovered in the floor of the Officers’ Prison, No. 6, at the Dépôt.\r\nThis building, a two-story oblong one, now one of the hospitals, still\r\nstands to the south of the General Prison Village Square. An excavation\r\nof sufficient diameter to admit the passage of a man had been cut with\r\niron hoops, as it was supposed, carried nineteen feet perpendicularly\r\ndown-wards and thirty feet horizontally outwards.\r\n\r\nA detachment of the guard having been marched into the prison after this\r\ndiscovery, the men were stoned by the prisoners, among whom the soldiers\r\nfired three shots without doing any injury. At 11 o’clock the next\r\nSunday morning, about forty prisoners were observed by a sentry out of\r\ntheir prison, strolling about the airing ground of No. 3. An alarm was\r\nimmediately given to the guard, who, fearing a general attempt to\r\nescape, rushed towards the place where the prisoners were assembled,\r\nand, having seized twenty-four of them, drove the rest back into the\r\nprison. In the tumult three of the prisoners were wounded and were taken\r\nto the hospital. The twenty-four who were seized were lodged in the\r\n_cachot_, where they remained for a time, together with eleven retaken\r\nfugitives.\r\n\r\nNext morning, on counting over the prisoners in No. 3, twenty-eight were\r\nmissing. As a light had been observed in the latrine about 8 o’clock the\r\npreceding evening, that place was examined and a mine was discovered\r\ncommunicating with the great sewer of the Dépôt. Through this outlet the\r\nabsentees had escaped. Two of them were taken on the following Monday\r\nmorning at Bridge of Earn, four miles distant, and three more on\r\nThursday.\r\n\r\nA short time previous to this escape, 800 prisoners had been transferred\r\nto Perth from the Penicuik Dépôt, and these, it was said, were of a most\r\nturbulent and ungovernable character, so that the influence of these men\r\nwould necessitate a much sterner discipline, and communication between\r\nthe prisoners and the public much more restricted than hitherto. In the\r\nforegoing case the punishments had been very lenient, the market being\r\nshut only for one day.\r\n\r\nGradually most of the escaped prisoners were retaken, all in a very\r\nexhausted state.\r\n\r\nNot long after, heavy rains increased the waters of the canal so that,\r\nby breaking into it, they revealed an excavation being made from No. 1.\r\n\r\nIn the same month three prisoners got out, made their way to Findon,\r\nKincardineshire, stole a fishing-boat, provisioned it by thefts from\r\nother boats, and made off successfully.\r\n\r\nYet another mine was discovered this month. It ran from a latrine, not\r\nto the great sewer, but in a circuitous direction to meet it. The\r\nprisoners while working at this were surrounded by other prisoners, who\r\npretended to be amusing themselves, whilst they hid the workers from the\r\nview of the sentries. But an unknown watcher through a loophole in a\r\nturret saw the buckets of earth being taken to the well, pumped upon and\r\nwashed away through the sewer to the Tay, and he gave information.\r\n\r\nYet again a sentry noticed that buckets of earth were being carried from\r\nNo. 6 prison, and informed the officer of the guard, who found about\r\nthirty cartloads of earth heaped up at the two ends of the highest part\r\nof the prison known as the Cock Loft.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1814, the news of the dethronement of Bonaparte reached\r\nPerth, and was received with universal delight. The prisoners in the\r\nDépôt asked the agent, Captain Moriarty, to be allowed to illuminate for\r\nthe coming Peace and freedom, but at so short a notice little could be\r\ndone, although the tower was illuminated by the agent himself. That the\r\nfeeling among the prisoners was still strong for Bonaparte, however, was\r\npresently shown when half a dozen prisoners in the South Prison hoisted\r\nthe white flag of French Royalty. Almost the whole of their fellow\r\ncaptives clambered up the walls, tore down the flag, and threatened\r\nthose who hoisted it with violent treatment if they persisted.\r\n\r\nThe guard removed the Royalists to the hospital for safety, and later\r\ntheir opponents wrote a penitential letter to Captain Moriarty. In June\r\n1814 the removal of the prisoners began. Those that went down the river\r\nin boats were heartily cheered by the people. Others marched to\r\nNewburgh, where, on the quay, they held a last market for the sale of\r\ntheir manufactures, which was thronged by buyers anxious to get\r\nmementoes and willing to pay well for them. ‘All transactions were\r\nconducted honourably, while the additional graces of French politeness\r\nmade a deep impression upon the natives of Fife, both male and female,’\r\nadds the chronicler. It was during this march to Newburgh that the\r\nprisoners sold the New Testaments distributed among them by a zealous\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\nAltogether it was a pleasant wind-up to a long, sad period, especially\r\nfor the Frenchmen, many of whom got on board the transports at Newburgh\r\nvery much richer men than when they first entered the French dépôt, or\r\nthan they would have been had they never been taken prisoners.\r\nEspecially pleasant, too, is it to think that they left amidst tokens of\r\ngoodwill from the people amongst whom many of them had been long\r\ncaptive.\r\n\r\nThe Dépôt was finally closed July 31, 1814.\r\n\r\nDuring one year, that is between September 14, 1812, and September 24,\r\n1813, there were fourteen escapes or attempted escapes of prisoners. Of\r\nthese seven were frustrated and seven were more or less successful, that\r\nis to say, sixty-one prisoners managed to get out of the prison, but of\r\nthese thirty-two were recaptured while twenty-nine got clean away.\r\n\r\nFrom 1815 to 1833 the Dépôt was used as a military clothing store, and\r\neventually it became the General Prison for Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                             4. PORTCHESTER\r\n\r\nOf the thousands of holiday-makers and picnickers for whom Portchester\r\nCastle is a happy recreation ground, and of the hundreds of antiquaries\r\nwho visit it as being one of the most striking relics of combined Roman\r\nand Norman military architecture in Britain, a large number, no doubt,\r\nlearn that it was long used as a place of confinement for foreign\r\nprisoners of war, but are not much impressed with the fact, which is\r\nhardly to be wondered at, not only because the subject of the foreign\r\nprisoners of war in Britain has never received the attention it\r\ndeserves, but because the interest of the comparatively modern must\r\nalways suffer when in juxtaposition with the interest of the far-away\r\npast.\r\n\r\nBut this comparatively modern interest of Portchester is, as I hope to\r\nshow, very real.\r\n\r\nAs a place of confinement Portchester could never, of course, compare\r\nwith such purposely planned prisons as Dartmoor, Stapleton, Perth, or\r\nNorman Cross. Still, from its position, and its surrounding walls of\r\nalmost indestructible masonry, from fifteen to forty feet high and from\r\nsix to ten feet thick, it answered its purpose very well. True, its\r\nsituation so near the Channel would seem to favour attempts to escape,\r\nbut it must be remembered that escape from Portchester Castle by no\r\nmeans implied escape from England, for, ere the fugitive could gain the\r\nopen sea, he had a terrible gauntlet to run of war-shipping and forts\r\nand places of watch and ward, so that although the number of attempted\r\nescapes from Portchester annually was greater than that of similar\r\nattempts from other places of confinement, the successful ones were few.\r\n\r\nPortchester is probably the oldest regular war prison in Britain. In\r\n1745 the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ records the escape of Spanish prisoners\r\nfrom it, taken, no doubt, during the War of the Austrian Succession, but\r\nit was during the Seven Years’ War that it became eminent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _An Inside View of PORTCHESTER CASTLE in HAMPSHIRE. Dedicated to the\r\n    Officers of the Militia._\r\n\r\n  _Engraved from a Drawing taken on the Spot by an Officer._\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1756 Captain Fraboulet of the French East India Company’s frigate\r\n_Astrée_, who appears to have been a medical representative of the\r\nGovernment, reported on the provisions at Portchester as being very good\r\non the whole, except the small beer, which he described as being very\r\nweak, and ‘apt to cause a flux of blood’, a very prevalent malady among\r\nthe prisoners. He complained, and the deficiency was remedied. Of the\r\nhospital accommodation he spoke badly. There was no hospital in the\r\nCastle itself, so that patients had either to be sent to Fareham, two\r\nmiles away, where the hospital was badly placed, being built of wood and\r\npartly on the muddy shores of the river, or to Forton, which, he says,\r\nis seven miles off. This distance, he says, could be reduced, if done by\r\nwater, but it was found impossible to find boatmen to take the invalids,\r\nthe result being that they were carted there, and often died on the way.\r\nHe also complained that in the hospital the dying and the convalescent\r\nwere in the same wards, and he begged the Government to establish a\r\nhospital at Portchester. He says that he will distribute the King’s\r\nBounty no more to invalids, as they spend it improperly, bribing\r\nsentries and attendants, and all who have free access and egress, to get\r\nthem unfit food, such as raw fruit, salt herrings, &c. He will only pay\r\nhealthy men. He has done his best to re-establish order in the Castle;\r\nhas asked the Commissioners of the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office to put down\r\nthe public gaming-tables; to imprison those who gamble and sell their\r\nkits and food, and to stop the sale of raw fruit, salt fish, and all\r\nfood which promotes flux of blood.\r\n\r\nIn 1766 Valérie Coffre quarrelled with a fellow prisoner, Nicholas\r\nChartier, and killed him with a knife. He was found guilty and sentenced\r\nto death. He was attended by a Roman Catholic priest, was very earnest\r\nin his devotions, and was executed at Winchester, the whole of his\r\nfellow prisoners being marched thither under a strong guard to witness\r\nthe scene. He was a handsome, well-built man of twenty-two.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 the Castle was properly fitted up as a War Prison. The ancient\r\nmoat outside the walls, which during long years of neglect had become\r\nchoked up with rubbish, was filled with water, and the keep was divided\r\ninto five stories, connected with a wooden stairway at the side, and the\r\nentire Castle was arranged for the accommodation of about 8,000\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PLAN OF PORTCHESTER CASTLE, 1793.\r\n\r\n  A. Kitchens, B. Hospital. C. Black Hole. D. Caserns. E. Great Tower.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1794 the prisoners captured in Howe’s victory of the ‘Glorious First\r\nof June’ were lodged in Portchester. One of the prizes taken, the\r\n_Impétueux_, took fire, and at one time there was danger that the fire\r\nwould spread. The prisoners at Portchester were delighted, and danced\r\nabout singing the _Ça ira_ and the _Marseillaise_, but happily the ship\r\ngrounded on a mud-bank, and no further damage was done.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 two prisoners quarrelled over politics, one stabbed the other to\r\ndeath, and was hanged at Winchester.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the agent in charge complained that many Portsmouth people,\r\nunder pretence of attending Portchester Parish Church, which stood\r\nwithin the Castle _enceinte_, came really to buy straw hats and other\r\nforbidden articles manufactured by the prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience of the position of this church was further manifested\r\nby a daring escape which was made about this time. One Sunday morning,\r\njust as service had begun, the sentry on duty at the Water Gate saw\r\nthree naval officers in full uniform come towards him from the\r\nchurchyard. Thinking that they were British officers who had seen their\r\nmen into church and were going for a walk, he presented arms and allowed\r\nthem to pass. Soon after it was discovered that three smart French\r\nprivateer captains had escaped, and without doubt they had contrived to\r\nget second-hand British naval uniforms smuggled in to them by\r\n_soi-disant_ worshippers!\r\n\r\nA comical incident is recorded in connexion with Portchester churchyard.\r\nA sentry was always on duty at an angle of the churchyard close to the\r\nSouth or Water Gate, where there was and still is a remarkable echo.\r\nUpon one wild, stormy night, this position was occupied by a soldier of\r\nthe Dorset Militia, which, with the Denbighshire Militia, performed\r\ngarrison duty at the Castle. Suddenly the man saw against the wall a\r\ntall, white figure with huge horns. He mastered up courage enough to\r\nchallenge it, but the only reply was a distinct repetition of his words.\r\nHe fired his piece, but in his agitation evidently missed his aim, for\r\nthe figure bounded towards him, and he, persuaded that he had to do with\r\nthe Devil, ran, and gave the alarm. Captain M., the officer of the\r\nguard, cursed the man for his fears and, drawing his sword, ran out to\r\nmeet the intruder. The figure charged him, bowled him over among the\r\ngravestones, and made for the Landport Gate, the sentry at which had\r\njust opened it at the sound of the disturbance in the churchyard, to see\r\nwhat was going on. The figure disposed of him as he had done Captain M.,\r\nand made straight away for the door of the Denbighshires’ drum-major’s\r\nquarters, where it proved to be the huge, white regimental goat, who,\r\nwhen disturbed by the sentry, had been browsing upon his hind legs, on\r\nthe pellitory which grows on the Castle walls!\r\n\r\nFrom the Rev. J. D. Henderson’s little book on Portchester I take the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘One Francis Dufresne, who was confined here for more than five years,\r\nescaped again and again, despite the vigilance of his guards. He seems\r\nto have been as reckless and adventurous as any hero of romance, and the\r\nneighbourhood was full of stories of his wanderings and the tricks he\r\nresorted to to obtain food. Once, after recapture, he was confined in\r\nthe Black Hole, a building still to be seen at the foot of the Great\r\nTower, called the “Exchequer” on plans of the Castle. Outside walked a\r\nsentry day and night, but Dufresne was not to be held. He converted his\r\nhammock into what sailors call a “thumb line”, and at the dead of night\r\nremoved a flat stone from under his prison door, crawled out, passed\r\nwith silent tread within a few inches of the sentry, gained a winding\r\nstair which led to the summit of the Castle wall, from which he\r\ndescended by the cord, and, quickly gaining the open country, started\r\nfor London, guiding himself by the stars. Arrived in London, he made his\r\nway to the house of M. Otto, the French Agent for arranging the exchange\r\nof prisoners. Having explained, to the amazement of Otto, that he had\r\nescaped from Portchester, he said:\r\n\r\n‘“Give me some sort of a suit of clothes, and a few sous to defray my\r\nexpenses to the Castle, and I’ll return and astonish the natives.”\r\n\r\n‘Otto, amused at the man’s cleverness and impudence, complied, and\r\nDufresne in a few days alighted from the London coach at Fareham, walked\r\nover to Portchester, but was refused admission by the guard, until, to\r\nthe amazement of the latter, he produced the passport by which he had\r\ntravelled. He was soon after this exchanged.\r\n\r\n‘Sheer devilment and the enjoyment of baffling his custodians seems to\r\nhave been Dufresne’s sole object in escaping. For a trifling wager he\r\nwould scale the walls, remain absent for a few days, living on and among\r\nthe country folk, and return as he went, so that he became almost a\r\npopular character even with the garrison.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch romance which has been unrecorded no doubt is interwoven with the\r\nlives of the foreign prisoners of war in Britain. Two cases associated\r\nwith Portchester deserve mention.\r\n\r\nThe church register of 1812 records the marriage of Patrick Bisson to\r\nJosephine Desperoux. The latter was one of a company of French ladies\r\nwho, on their voyage to Mauritius, were captured by a British cruiser,\r\nand sent to Portchester. Being non-combatants, they were of course not\r\nsubjected to durance vile in the Castle, but were distributed among the\r\nhouses of the village, and, being young and comely, were largely\r\nentertained and fêted by the gentry of the neighbourhood, the result\r\nbeing that one, at least, the subject of our notice, captivated an\r\nEnglish squire, and married him.\r\n\r\nThe second case is that of a French girl, who, distracted because her\r\nsailor lover had been captured, enlisted as a sailor on a privateer on\r\nthe bare chance of being captured and meeting him. As good luck would\r\nhave it, she was captured, and sent to the very prison where was her\r\nsweetheart, Portchester Castle. For some months she lived there without\r\nrevealing her sex, until she was taken ill, sent to the hospital, where,\r\nof course, her secret was soon discovered. She was persuaded to return\r\nto France on the distinct promise that her lover should be speedily\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to escape which had fatal results was made in 1797.\r\nInformation was given to the authorities that a long tunnel had been\r\nmade from one of the prison blocks to the outside. So it was arranged\r\nthat, at a certain hour after lock-up time, the guards should rush in\r\nand catch the plotters at work. They did so, and found the men in the\r\ntunnel. Shortly afterwards the alarm was given in another quarter, and\r\nprisoners were caught in the act of escaping through a large hole they\r\nhad made in the Castle wall. All that night the prisoners were very\r\nriotous, keeping candles lighted, singing Republican songs, dancing and\r\ncheering, so that ‘it was found necessary’ to fire ball cartridges among\r\nthem, by which many men were wounded. But the effect of this was only\r\ntemporary. Next morning the tumult and disorder recommenced. The\r\nsentries were abused and insulted, and one prisoner, trying to get out\r\nat a ventilator in the roof of one of the barracks, was shot in the\r\nback, but not mortally. Another was shot through the heart, and the\r\ncoroner’s verdict at the inquest held upon him was ‘Justifiable\r\nHomicide’.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion treachery revealed a plot of eighteen Spaniards,\r\nwho, armed with daggers which they had made out of horseshoe files,\r\nassembled in a vault under one of the towers with the idea of sallying\r\nforth, cutting down the sentries, and making off; but the guards crawled\r\nin and disarmed them after a short struggle.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 a brewer’s man, John Cassel, was sentenced to six months’\r\nimprisonment for helping two French captains to escape by carrying them\r\naway in empty beer casks.\r\n\r\nIn _The Times_ of July 2, 1799, I find the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Three French prisoners made their escape from Portchester to\r\nSouthampton. A party of pleasure seekers had engaged Wassell’s vessel to\r\ngo to the Isle of Wight. At an early hour on Saturday morning on\r\nrepairing to the Quay, the man could not discover his pleasure boat.\r\nEveryone was concerned for his loss, and many hours elapsed before any\r\ntidings could be heard of her, when some fishing-boats gave information\r\nthat they had met her near Calshot Castle about 3 a.m., but had no\r\nsuspicion she had been run away with. In the evening news came that in\r\nsteering so as to keep as far from Spithead as possible, the Frenchmen\r\nwere near running ashore at Ryde. This convinced the pilots that Wassell\r\nwas not on board the vessel, when they went to its assistance, secured\r\nthe three men and saved the vessel.’\r\n\r\n‘The bodies of six drowned Frenchmen were found in Portsmouth Harbour;\r\ntheir clothes were in bundles on their backs, and their swimming, no\r\ndoubt, was impeded thereby.’\r\n\r\n‘1800, August: A naked French prisoner was found in a field near\r\nPortchester. He said he had lived on corn for three days, and that the\r\nbody of his friend was lying on the beach close by.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quiet pathos of the above two bald newspaper announcements must\r\nappeal to everybody who for a moment pictures in his mind what the six\r\npoor, drowned fellows, and the two friends—one taken, the other\r\nleft—must have gone through in their desperate bids for liberty. These\r\nare the little by-scenes which make up the great tragedy of the War\r\nPrisoners in England.\r\n\r\nIn December of this year there was great sickness and mortality at\r\nPortchester.\r\n\r\nIn the same year a plot to murder sentries and escape was discovered the\r\nday before the date of the arranged deed. Forty men were concerned in\r\nthe plot, and upon them were found long knives, sharpened on both sides,\r\nmade out of iron hoops.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 a Portchester prisoner named Cabosas was fined one shilling at\r\nWinchester for killing a fellow prisoner in a duel, and in the same year\r\none Herquiand was hanged at Winchester for murder in the Castle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CLOCK MADE IN PORTCHESTER CASTLE, 1809\r\n\r\n  by French prisoners of war, from bones saved from their rations\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1810 it was reported that Portchester Castle was too crowded, and\r\nthat only 5,900 prisoners could be kept in health there instead of the\r\nusual 7,000.\r\n\r\nI will now give some accounts of life at Portchester, and I begin with\r\none by an English officer, ‘The Light Dragoon,’ as a relief from the\r\nsomewhat monotonous laments which characterize the average foreign\r\nchronicler, although it will be noted that our writer does not allow his\r\npatriotism to bias his judgement.\r\n\r\nPlaced on guard over the prisoners, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Whatever grounds of boasting may belong to us as a nation, I am afraid\r\nthat our methods of dealing with the prisoners taken from the French\r\nduring the war scarcely deserves to be classed among them. Absolute\r\ncruelties were never, I believe, perpetrated on these unfortunate\r\nbeings; neither, as far as I know, were they, on any pretence whatever,\r\nstinted in the allowance of food awarded to them. But in other respects\r\nthey fared hardly enough. Their sleeping apartments, for instance, were\r\nvery much crowded. Few paroles were extended to them (it is past dispute\r\nthat when the parole was obtained they were, without distinction of\r\nrank, apt to make a bad use of it), while their pay was calculated on a\r\nscale as near to the line of starvation as could in any measure\r\ncorrespond with our nation’s renown for humanity. On the other hand,\r\nevery possible encouragement was given to the exercise of ingenuity\r\namong the prisoners themselves by the throwing open of the Castle yard\r\nonce or twice a week, when their wares were exhibited for sale, amid\r\nnumerous groups of jugglers, tumblers, and musicians, all of whom\r\nfollowed their respective callings, if not invariably with skill, always\r\nwith most praiseworthy perseverance. Moreover, the ingenuity of the\r\ncaptives taught them how on these occasions to set up stalls on which\r\nall manner of trinkets were set forth, as well as puppet shows and\r\nPunch’s opera.... Then followed numerous purchases, particularly on the\r\npart of the country people, of bone and ivory knick-knacks, fabricated\r\ninvariably with a common penknife, yet always neat, and not infrequently\r\nelegant. Nor must I forget to mention the daily market which the\r\npeasantry, particularly the women, were in the habit of attending, and\r\nwhich usually gave scope for the exchange of Jean Crapaud’s manufacture\r\nfor Nancy’s eggs, or Joan’s milk, or home-baked loaf....\r\n\r\n‘It happened one night that a sentry whose post lay outside the walls of\r\nthe old Castle, was startled by the sound as of a hammer driven against\r\nthe earth under his feet. The man stopped, listened, and was more and\r\nmore convinced that neither his fears nor his imagination had misled\r\nhim. So he reported the circumstance to the sergeant who next visited\r\nhis post, and left him to take in the matter such steps as might be\r\nexpedient. The sergeant, having first ascertained, as in duty bound,\r\nthat the man spoke truly, made his report to the captain on duty, who\r\nimmediately doubled the sentry at the indicated spot, and gave strict\r\norders that should as much as one French prisoner be seen making his way\r\nbeyond the Castle walls, he should be shot without mercy.\r\n\r\n‘Then was the whole of the guard got under arms: then were beacons fired\r\nin various quarters; while far and near, from Portsmouth not less than\r\nfrom the cantonments more close at hand, bodies of troops marched upon\r\nPortchester. Among others came the general of the district, bringing\r\nwith him a detachment of sappers and miners, by whom all the floors of\r\nthe several bedrooms were tried, and who soon brought the matter home to\r\nthose engaged in it. Indeed one man was taken in the gallery he was\r\nseeking to enlarge, his only instrument being a spike nail wherewith to\r\nlabour. The plot thus discovered was very extensive and must, if carried\r\nthrough, have proved a desperate one to both parties. For weeks previous\r\nto the discovery, the prisoners, it appeared, had been at work, and from\r\nnot fewer than seven rooms, all of them on the ground floor, they had\r\nsunk shafts 12 feet in depth, and caused them all to meet at one common\r\ncentre, whence as many chambers went off. These were driven beyond the\r\nextremity of the outer wall, and one, that of which the sentry was thus\r\nunexpectedly made aware, the ingenious miners had carried forward with\r\nsuch skill, that in two days more it would have been in a condition to\r\nbe opened.\r\n\r\n‘The rubbish, it appeared, which from these several covered ways they\r\nscooped out, was carried about by the prisoners in their pockets till\r\nthey found an opportunity of scattering it over the surface of the great\r\nsquare. Yet the desperate men had a great deal more to encounter than\r\nthe mere obstacles which the excavation of the castle at Portchester\r\npresented.\r\n\r\n‘Their first proceeding after emerging into the upper air must needs\r\nhave been to surprise and overpower the troops that occupied the\r\nbarracks immediately contiguous, an operation of doubtful issue at the\r\nbest, and not to be accomplished without a terrible loss of life,\r\ncertainly on one side, probably on both. Moreover, when this was done,\r\nthere remained for the fugitives the still more arduous task of making\r\ntheir way through the heart of the garrison town of Portsmouth, and\r\nseizing a flotilla of boats, should such be high and dry upon the beach.\r\nYet worse even than this remained, for both the harbour and the roads\r\nwore crowded with men-of-war the gauntlet of whose batteries the\r\ndeserters must of necessity have run....’\r\n\r\n\r\nOne wishes that the British officer could have given us some account of\r\nthe inner life at Portchester, from his point of view, but the foreign\r\nnarratives which follow seem to have been written in a fair and broad\r\nspirit which would certainly have not been manifest had the _genius\r\nloci_ of the hulks been influencing the minds of the writers.\r\n\r\nThe two following accounts, by St. Aubin and Philippe Gille, were\r\nwritten by men who were probably in Portchester at the same time, as\r\nboth had come to England from Cabrera—that terrible prison island south\r\nof Majorca, to which the Spaniards sent the captives of Baylen in July\r\n1808—unfortunates whose prolonged living death there must ever remain an\r\nindelible stain upon our conduct during the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\nSt. Aubin describes the Castle as divided into two by a broad road\r\nrunning between palisades, on the one side of which were a large and a\r\nsmall tower and nine two-storied wooden buildings, and on the other a\r\nchurch, kitchens, storehouses, offices, and hospital. It is evident that\r\nwhat he calls the large tower is the castle keep, for this held from\r\n1,200 to 1,500 prisoners, while each of the nine barracks accommodated\r\n500.\r\n\r\nSt. Aubin gives us the most detailed account of the Portchester\r\nprisoners and their life. At 6 a.m. in summer, and 7 in winter, the bell\r\nannounced the arrival of the soldiers and turnkeys, who opened the doors\r\nand counted the prisoners. At 9 o’clock the market bell rang and the\r\ndistributions of bread were made. The prisoners were divided into\r\n_plats_ or messes of twelve, each _plat_ was again subdivided, and each\r\nhad two _gamelles_ or soup-pots. At midday the bell announced the\r\nclosing of the market to English sellers, who were replaced by French,\r\nand also the distribution of soup and meat. At sunset the bell went\r\nagain, jailers and soldiers went through the evening count, all were\r\nobliged to be within doors, and lights were put out.\r\n\r\nOccasionally in the _grand pré_, as the enclosure within the walls was\r\ncalled, there was a general airing of prisons and hammocks, and the\r\nprisoners were obliged to stay out of doors till midday; during this\r\nperformance the masons went round to sound walls and floors, to see that\r\nno attempts to escape were being engineered. Each story of the tower and\r\nthe prisons had two prison superintendents at eight shillings per month,\r\nwho were responsible for their cleanliness, and a barber. The doctor\r\nwent through the rooms every day.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners prepared their own food, the wages of the master cooks\r\nbeing sevenpence per diem. St. Aubin complains bitterly of the quality\r\nof the provisions, especially of the bread, and says that it was quite\r\ninsufficient on account of the avarice of the contractors, but at any\r\nrate, he says, it was regularly distributed.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, Portchester was preferred by the prisoners to\r\nother dépôts, because it was easy to get money and letters from France;\r\nand it may be noted that while we get little or no mention of recreation\r\nand amusement at Norman Cross, or Stapleton, or Perth, unless gambling\r\ncomes within the category, we shall see that at Portchester the\r\nprisoners seem to have done their very best to make the long days pass\r\nas pleasantly as possible.\r\n\r\nPortchester was a veritable hive of industry. There were manufacturers\r\nof straw hats, stockings, gloves, purses, and braces. There were cunning\r\nartificers in bone who made tobacco boxes, dominoes, chessmen, models of\r\nall kinds, especially of men-of-war, one of which latter, only one foot\r\nin length, is said to have been sold for £26, as well as of the most\r\nartistic ornaments and knick-knacks. There were tailors, goldsmiths (so\r\nsays St. Aubin), shoemakers, caterers, limonadiers, and comedians of the\r\nPunch and Judy and marionette class. There were professors of\r\nmathematics, of drawing, of French, of English, of Latin, of fencing, of\r\nwriting, of dancing, of the _bâton_, and of _la boxe_. St. Aubin quotes\r\nas a strange fact that most of the prisoners who, on going to\r\nPortchester, knew neither reading nor writing, ‘en sont sortis la tête\r\net la bourse passablement meublées.’\r\n\r\nBut the unique feature of Portchester industry was its thread lace\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BONE MODEL OF H.M.S. _VICTORY_\r\n\r\n  Made by prisoners of war at Portsmouth\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant idea of starting this belonged to a French soldier\r\nprisoner who had been born and bred in a lace-making country, and had\r\nbeen accustomed to see all the women working at it. He recalled the\r\nprocess by memory, took pupils, and in less than a year there were 3,000\r\nprisoners in Portchester making lace, and among these were ‘capitalists’\r\nwho employed each as many as from fifty to sixty workmen. So beautiful\r\nwas this lace, and so largely was it bought by the surrounding families,\r\nthat the English lace-makers protested, its manufacture within the\r\nprison was forbidden, and it is said that the work of suppression was\r\ncarried out in the most brutal manner, the machines being broken and all\r\nlace in stock or in process of manufacture destroyed.\r\n\r\nGambling, says St. Aubin, was the all-pervading vice of Portchester, as\r\nin the other prisons. For ‘capitalists’ there was actually a roulette\r\ntable, but the rank and file gambled upon the length of straws, with\r\ncards or dominoes, for their rations, their clothes, or their bedding.\r\nThe authorities attempted occasionally to check the mania among the most\r\nenslaved by placing them apart from their fellows, reclothing them, and\r\nmaking them eat their rations, but in vain, for they pierced the walls\r\nof their places of confinement, and sold their clothes through the\r\napertures. Duels, as a consequence, were frequent, the usual time for\r\nthese being the dinner hour, because all the prisoners were then\r\ntemporarily in the _salles_.\r\n\r\nSt. Aubin thus describes his fellow prisoners. Sailors, he says, were\r\nbrusque but obliging; soldiers were more honest, softer and less prompt\r\nto help; maîtres d’armes were proud and despotic. The scum of the\r\ncommunity were the Raffalés, who lived in the top story of the tower.\r\nAmong the two hundred of these there were only two or three suits of\r\nclothes, which were worn in turn by those who had to go out foraging for\r\nfood. These men terrorized the rest, and their captain was even held in\r\nsome sort of fear, if not respect, by the authorities.\r\n\r\nThe prison amusements were various. The prisoners who had no occupations\r\nplayed draughts, cards, dominoes, and billiards. On Sundays the beer-man\r\ncame, and much drunkenness prevailed, especially upon fête days, such as\r\nSt. Martin’s, Christmas, and August 15, the Emperor’s birthday: the\r\nprincipal drinks being compounds of beer and spirits known as ‘strom’\r\nand ‘shum’. On St. Cecilia’s Day the musicians always gave an\r\nentertainment, but the chief form of amusement was the theatre.\r\n\r\nThis was arranged in the basement of the large tower—that is, the keep,\r\nwhere three hundred people could be accommodated. Part of the boxes were\r\nset apart for English visitors, who appreciated the French performances\r\nso much that they even said that they were better than what they were\r\naccustomed to in Portsmouth, and flocked to them, much to the disgust of\r\nthe native managers, who represented to the authorities that those\r\nuntaxed aliens were taking the bread out of their mouths. The Government\r\nconsidered the matter, and upon the plea that the admission of the\r\nEnglish public to the French theatre was leading to too great intimacy\r\nbetween the peoples, and thus would further the escapes of prisoners,\r\ntook advantage of the actual escape of a prisoner in English dress to\r\nordain that although the theatre might continue as heretofore, no\r\nEnglish were to be admitted. The result of this was that the receipts\r\ndropped from £12 to £5 a night.\r\n\r\nSt. Aubin remarks, _en passant_, that Commander William Patterson and\r\nMajor Gentz, who were chiefly responsible for the retention of the\r\ntheatre, were the only Englishmen he ever met who were worthy of\r\nrespect!\r\n\r\nOf the pieces played, St. Aubin mentions _L’Heureuse Étourderie_ by\r\nhimself; the tragedies _Zaïre_, _Mahomet_, _Les Templiers_; the comedies\r\n_Les Deux Gendres_, _Les Folies amoureuses_, _Le Barbier de Séville_,\r\n_Le Tyran domestique_, _Défiance et Malice_; many dramas, and even\r\nvaudevilles and operas such as _Les Deux Journées_, _Pierre le Grand_,\r\n_Françoise de Foix_, of which the music was composed by prisoners and\r\nplayed by an orchestra of twelve.\r\n\r\nA terrible murder is said to have been the outcome of theatricals in the\r\nprison. In describing it St. Aubin starts with the opinion that ‘Les\r\nmaîtres d’armes sont toujours fort vilains messieurs’. There was a\r\nquarrel between a gunner and a _maître des logis_; some said it was\r\nabout a theatrical part, but others that the gunner, Tardif, had\r\ncommitted a crime in past days, had described it in writing, that the\r\npaper had fallen from his hammock into that of Leguay, the _maître des\r\nlogis_, and that Tardif determined to get the possessor of his secret\r\nout of the way. So he attacked Leguay, who ran bleeding to his hammock,\r\nfollowed by Tardif, who then dispatched him, and displayed a strange,\r\nfierce joy at the deed when overpowered and tied to a pillar. He was\r\ntried, and condemned to be hanged at Portchester in the sight of all the\r\nprisoners. ‘The scaffold was erected on the Portsmouth road’, says St.\r\nAubin, not within the Castle precincts, as another account states. He\r\nhad previously sold his body for ten francs to a surgeon for dissection.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the prisoners the body of Leguay was buried in\r\nPortchester churchyard. All joined to raise funds for the funeral, and\r\nthe proceeds of a performance of _Robert, chef de brigands_, was devoted\r\nto the relief of the widow and children of the murdered man.\r\n\r\nAt the funeral of Leguay, sous-officiers of his regiment, the 10th\r\nDragoons, carried the coffin, which was preceded by a British military\r\nband, and followed by the sous-officiers in uniform, British officers,\r\nand inhabitants of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nTardif was conveyed from Winchester to the _King’s Arms_ Inn at\r\nPortchester, where Mr. White, the Roman Catholic priest, tried to get\r\nhim to take the last Sacrament, but in vain: Tardif only wanted the\r\nexecution to be got over as soon as possible. He was taken in a cart to\r\nthe prison yard, where were assembled 7,000 prisoners. Again the priest\r\nurged him to repent, but it was useless. The cap was drawn over his\r\nface, but he tore it away, and died as he had lived. The behaviour of\r\nthe spectator prisoners was exemplary.\r\n\r\nAt the Peace and Restoration of 1814, although the Portchester prisoners\r\nwere Bonapartists almost to a man, quite a boyish joy was exhibited at\r\nthe approaching liberation: great breakfasts were given in the village,\r\nand by the end of May the Castle was empty.\r\n\r\nThe notes on Portchester of Philippe Gille, author of _Mémoires d’un\r\nConscrit de 1798_, are as interesting as those of St. Aubin,\r\nparticularly as regards the amusements of the prisoners, and I make no\r\napology for adding to them his immediately previous experiences, as they\r\nare not distasteful reading.\r\n\r\nGille was taken prisoner in Baylen, and at first was put on board No. 27\r\nHulk, at Cadiz, in which ship, he says, were crowded no less than 1,824\r\nprisoners! Thence he was sent to Cabrera and relates his frightful\r\nexperiences on that prison island.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the prisoners were taken on board British ships, and\r\nlearned that their destination was an English prison—perhaps the dreaded\r\nhulks!\r\n\r\nGille was on board the _Britannia_. Let me tell the effect of the change\r\nin his own words, they are so gratifying:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Aux traitements cruels des féroces Espagnols succédaient tout à coup\r\nles soins compatissants des soldats et matelots anglais; ces braves gens\r\nnous témoignaient toutes sortes d’égards. Ils transportèrent à bras\r\nplusieurs de nos camarades malades ou amputés. Les effets qui nous\r\nappartenaient furent aussi montés par leurs soins, sans qu’ils nous\r\nlaissaient prendre la peine de rien.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn board there were cleanliness and space, good food for officers and\r\nmen alike, and plenty of it, the allowance being the same for six\r\nprisoners as for four British. Rum was regularly served out, and Gille\r\nlays stress on a pudding the prisoners made, into the composition of\r\nwhich it entered.\r\n\r\nThey duly reached Plymouth; the beautiful scenery impressed Gille, but\r\nhe was most astonished when the market-boats came alongside to see\r\nfish-women clothed in black velvet, with feathers and flowers in their\r\nhats!\r\n\r\nThence to Portsmouth, where they got a first sight of the hulks, which\r\nmade Gille shudder, but he was relieved to learn that he and his fellows\r\nwere destined for a shore prison.\r\n\r\nOn September 28, 1810, they arrived at Portchester. Here they were\r\nminutely registered, and clothed in a sleeved vest, waistcoat, and\r\ntrousers of yellow cloth, and a blue and white striped cotton shirt, and\r\nprovided with a hammock, a flock mattress of two pounds weight, a\r\ncoverlet, and tarred cords for hammock lashings.\r\n\r\nGille gives much interesting detail about the theatre. The Agent,\r\nWilliam Patterson, found it good policy to further any scheme by which\r\nthe prisoners could be kept wholesomely occupied, and so provided all\r\nthe wood necessary for the building of the theatre, which was in charge\r\nof an ex-chief-machinist of the Théâtre Feydau in Paris, Carré by name.\r\nHe made a row of boxes and a hall capable of holding 300 people, and\r\nthoroughly transformed the base story of the keep, which was unoccupied\r\nbecause prisoners confined there in past times had died in great\r\nnumbers, and the authorities deemed it unwholesome as a sleeping-place.\r\n\r\nCarré’s Arabian _Féerie_ was a tremendous success, but it led to the\r\nGovernmental interference with the theatre already mentioned. An English\r\nmajor who took a lively interest in the theatre (probably the Major\r\nGentz alluded to by St. Aubin) had his whole regiment in to see it at\r\none shilling a head, and published in the Portsmouth papers a glowing\r\npanegyric upon it, and further invited the directors of the Portsmouth\r\nTheatre to ‘come to see how a theatre should be run’. They came, were\r\nvery pleased and polite, but very soon after came an order from the\r\nauthorities that the theatre should be shut. However, by the influence\r\nof the Agent, it was permitted to continue, on the condition that no\r\nEnglish people were to be admitted.\r\n\r\nCarré painted a drop-scene which was a masterpiece. It was a view of\r\nParis from a house at the corner of the Place Dauphine on the Pont-Neuf,\r\nshowing the Café Paris on the point of the island, the Bridges of the\r\nArts, the Royal and the Concorde, and the Bains des Bons-Hommes in the\r\ndistance, the Colonnade of the Louvre, the Tuileries with the national\r\nflag flying, the Hôtel de Monnaies, the Quatre Nations, and the\r\n‘théatins’ of the Quai Voltaire. It may be imagined how this home-touch\r\naroused the enthusiasm of the poor exiles!\r\n\r\nNew plays were received from Paris, amongst them _Le Petit Poucet_, _Le\r\nDiable ou la Bohémienne_, _Les Deux Journées_ and _Adolphe et Clara_.\r\nThe musical pieces were accompanied by an orchestra (of prisoners, of\r\ncourse) under Corret of the Conservatoire, who composed fresh music for\r\nsuch representations as _Françoise de Foix_ and _Pierre le Grand_, as\r\ntheir original music was too expensive, and who played the cornet solos,\r\nGourdet being first violin.\r\n\r\nGille’s own _métier_ was to make artificial flowers, and to give lessons\r\nin painting, for which he took pupils at one franc fifty centimes a\r\nmonth—the regulation price for all lessons. He also learned the violin,\r\nand had an instrument made by a fellow prisoner.\r\n\r\nAt Portchester, as elsewhere, a Masonic Lodge was formed among the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 was brought to light the great plot for the 70,000 prisoners in\r\nEngland to rise simultaneously, to disarm their guards, who were only\r\nmilitia men, and to carry on a guerilla warfare, avoiding all towns. At\r\nPortchester the 7,000 prisoners were to overpower the garrison, which\r\nhad two cannon and 800 muskets, and march to Forton, where were 3,000\r\nprisoners. The success of the movement was to depend upon the\r\nco-operation of the Boulogne troops and ships, in keeping the British\r\nfleet occupied, but the breaking up of the Boulogne Camp, in order to\r\nreinforce the Grand Army for the expedition to Russia, caused the\r\nabandonment of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe news of the advance of the Allies in France only served to bind the\r\nImperialists together: the tricolour cockade was universally worn, and\r\nan English captain who entered the Castle wearing a white cockade was\r\ngreeted with hisses, groans, and even stone-throwing, and was only saved\r\nfrom further mischief by the Agent—a man much respected by the\r\nprisoners—who got him away and gave him a severe lecture on his\r\nfoolishness. On Easter Day, 1814, the news of Peace, of the accession of\r\nLouis XVIII, and of freedom for the prisoners came. The Agent asked the\r\nprisoners to hoist the white flag as a greeting to the French officer\r\nwho was coming to announce formally the great news, and to arrange for\r\nthe departure of the prisoners. A unanimous refusal was the result, and\r\na British soldier had to hoist the flag. Contre-amiral Troude came.\r\nThere was a strong feeling against him, inasmuch as it was reported that\r\nin order to gain his present position he had probably given up his fleet\r\nto England, and a resolution was drawn up not to acclaim him. All the\r\nsame, Gille says, the speech he made so impressed the prisoners that he\r\nwas loudly cheered, and went away overcome with emotion.\r\n\r\nThe next day his mission took him to the prison ships. Here he did not\r\nsucceed so well, for as he approached one of the hulks he had a large\r\nbasket of filth thrown over him, and he had to leave without boarding\r\nher. By way of punishment, the prisoners on this ship were made the last\r\nto leave England.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1814, the evacuation of Portchester began. Gille left on the\r\n20th, carrying away the best of feelings towards the Agent and the\r\nCommandant, the former showing his sympathy with the prisoners to the\r\nvery last, by taking steps so that the St. Malo men, of whom there were\r\na great many, should be sent direct to their port instead of being\r\nlanded at Calais.\r\n\r\nGille describes a very happy homeward voyage, thanks largely to the\r\nEnglish doctor on the ship, who, finding that Gille was a Mason, had him\r\ntreated with distinction, and even offered to help him with a loan of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nPillet, the irrepressible, tells a yarn that ‘Milor Cordower (Lord\r\nCawdor), Colonel du régiment de Carmarthen’, visiting the Castle one\r\nday, was forgetful enough to leave his horse unattended, tied up in the\r\ncourtyard; when he returned there was no horse to be found, and it\r\nturned out that the prisoners, mad with hunger, had taken the horse,\r\nkilled it, and eaten it raw. Pillet adds that all dogs who strayed\r\nPortchester way suffered the same fate, and that in support of his\r\nstatement he can bring many naval officers of Lorient and Brest.\r\n\r\nPillet’s story, I think, is rather better than Garneray’s about the\r\ngreat Dane on the prison ship (see pp. 68–71).\r\n\r\nThe last French prisoners left Portchester at the end of May 1814, but\r\nAmerican prisoners were here until January 1816. After the Peace all the\r\nwooden buildings were taken down and sold by auction (a row of cottages\r\nin Fareham, built out of the material, still enjoys the name of ‘Bug\r\nRow’). Relics of this period of the Castle’s history are very scanty.\r\nThe old Guard House at the Land Gate, now the Castle Custodian’s\r\ndwelling, remains much as it was, and a line of white stones on the\r\nopposite side of the approach marks the boundary of the old prison\r\nhospital, which is also commemorated in the name Hospital Lane.\r\n\r\nThe great tower still retains the five stories which were arranged for\r\nthe prisoners, and on the transverse beams are still the hooks to which\r\nthe hammocks were suspended. Some crude coloured decoration on the beams\r\nof the lowest story may have been the work of the French theatrical\r\nartists, but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nNames of French and other prisoners are cut on many of the walls and\r\nwooden beams, notably at the very top of the great tower, which is\r\nreached by a dark, steep newel stair of Norman work, now almost closed\r\nto the public on account of the dangerous condition of many of the\r\nsteps. This was the stair used by Dufresne, and the number of names cut\r\nin the topmost wall would seem to show that the lofty coign, whence\r\nmight be seen a widespread panorama, stretching on three sides far away\r\nto the Channel, and to these poor fellows possible liberty, was a\r\nfavourite resort. I noted some twenty decipherable names, the earliest\r\ndate being 1745 and the latest 1803.\r\n\r\nOnly one death appears in the Church Register—that of ‘Peter Goston, a\r\nFrench prisoner’, under date of December 18, 1812.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no separate burial ground for the rank and file\r\nof the prisoners, but it is said that they were shovelled away into the\r\ntide-swept mud-flats outside the South Gate, and that, for economy, a\r\nsingle coffin with a sliding bottom did duty for many corpses. But human\r\nremains in groups have been unearthed all around the Castle, and, as it\r\nis known that at certain periods the mortality among the prisoners was\r\nvery high, it is believed that these are to be dated from the\r\nprisoner-of-war epoch of the Castle’s history.\r\n\r\nNo descendants of the prisoners are to be traced in or about\r\nPortchester; but Mrs. Durrand, who is a familiar figure to all visitors\r\nto the Castle, believes that her late husband’s grandfather was a French\r\nprisoner of war here.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that Arthur Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington,\r\nwas at one time an officer of the garrison at Portchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  NOTE ON THE PORTCHESTER THEATRICALS\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the French paper _L’Intermédiaire_, the equivalent of\r\nour _Notes and Queries_, gives some details. The Portchester Theatricals\r\noriginated with the prisoners who came from Cabrera and the Isle de\r\nLéon. On these awful islands the prisoners played entirely as amateurs,\r\nbut at Portchester the majority of the actors were salaried; indeed,\r\nonly three were not.\r\n\r\nI give a list of the actors in or about the year 1810:\r\n\r\n 1. _Sociétaires_ (salaried subscribers).\r\n\r\n Hanin, an employé in the English prison office, with the purely\r\n   honorary title of Director.\r\n Breton, Sergeant, 2nd Garde de Paris      Comique.\r\n Reverdy, Sergeant, 2nd Garde de Paris     père noble.\r\n Lafontaine, Sergeant, 2nd Garde de Paris  jeune premier.\r\n Gruentgentz, Sergeant, 2nd Garde de Paris mère  et duègne.\r\n Moreau, Captain 2nd Garde de Paris        les Colins.\r\n Blin de Balue, Sergeant, Marine Artillery les tyrans.\r\n Sutat (?), Maréchal des logis             jeune première.\r\n Wanthies, Captain, 4th Legion             soubrette et jeune première.\r\n Defacq, fourrier, chasseurs à cheval      jeune premier en séconde.\r\n Siutor or Pintor, marin                   jouant les accessoires.\r\n Palluel, fourrier, 2nd Garde de Paris     bas comique.\r\n Carré, soldat, 2nd Garde de Paris         machiniste.\r\n Montlefort, Marine                        artificier.\r\n\r\n 2. _Amateurs._\r\n\r\n Gille, fourrier, 1st Legion               jeunes premiers.\r\n Quantin, fourrier, 1st Legion             les ingénues.\r\n Iwan, chasseurs à cheval                  les confidents.\r\n\r\nThe orchestra consisted of four violins, two horns, three clarinets, and\r\none ‘octave’.\r\n\r\nIn the above list both Gille and Quantin wrote memoirs of their stay at\r\nPortchester. The former I have quoted.\r\n\r\nA French writer thus sarcastically speaks of the dramatic efforts of\r\nthese poor fellows:\r\n\r\n‘Those who never have seen the performances of wandering _troupes_ in\r\nsome obscure village of Normandy or Brittany can hardly form an idea of\r\nthese prison representations wherein rough sailors with a few rags\r\nwrapped about them mouth the intrigues and sentiments of our great poets\r\nin the style of the cabaret.’\r\n\r\nNo doubt the performances on the hulks were poor enough. The wonder to\r\nus who know what life was on the hulks is, not that they were poor, but\r\nthat there was any heart to give them at all. But there is plenty of\r\nevidence that the performances in such a prison as Portchester, wherein\r\nwere assembled many men of education and refinement, were more than\r\ngood. At any rate, we have seen that they were good enough to attract\r\nEnglish audiences to such an extent as to interfere with the success of\r\nthe local native theatres, and to bring about the exclusion from them of\r\nthese English audiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                              5. LIVERPOOL\r\n\r\nLiverpool became a considerable dépôt for prisoners of war, from the\r\nforce of circumstances rather than from any suitability of its own. From\r\nits proximity to Ireland, the shelter and starting and refitting point\r\nof so many French, and, later, American privateers, Liverpool shared\r\nwith Bristol, and perhaps with London, the position of being the busiest\r\nprivateering centre in Britain.\r\n\r\nHence, from very early days in its history, prisoners were continually\r\npouring in and out; in, as the Liverpool privateers, well equipped and\r\narmed by wealthy individuals or syndicates, skilfully commanded and\r\nsplendidly fought, swept the narrow seas and beyond, and brought in\r\ntheir prizes; out, as both sides were ready enough to exchange men in a\r\ncontest of which booty was the main object, and because the guarding of\r\nhundreds of desperate seafaring men was a matter of great difficulty and\r\nexpense in an open port with no other than the usual accommodation for\r\nmalefactors.\r\n\r\nBefore 1756 the prisoners of war brought into Liverpool were stowed away\r\nin the common Borough Gaol and in an old powder magazine which stood on\r\nthe north side of Brownlow Street, where Russell Street now is.\r\nPrisoners taken in the Seven Years’ War and the American War of\r\nIndependence were lodged in the Tower Prison at the lower end of Water\r\nStreet, on the north side, where now Tower Buildings stand, between\r\nTower Garden and Stringers Alley, which remained the chief jail of\r\nLiverpool until July 1811. It was a castellated building of red\r\nsandstone, consisting of a large square embattled tower, with\r\nsubordinate towers and buildings, forming three sides of a quadrangle of\r\nwhich the fourth side was occupied by a walled garden, the whole\r\ncovering an area of about 3,700 square yards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE OLD TOWER PRISON, LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n  (_From an old print._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1756 the Admiralty had bought the dancing-room and the buildings\r\nadjoining at the bottom of Water Street, and ‘fitted them up for the\r\nFrench prisoners in a most commodious manner, there being a handsome\r\nkitchen with furnaces, &c., for cooking their provisions, and good\r\nlodging rooms both above and below stairs. Their lordships have ordered\r\na hammock and bedding (same as used on board our men of war), for each\r\nprisoner, which it is to be hoped will be a means of procuring our\r\ncountrymen who have fallen into their hands better usage than hitherto,\r\nmany of them having been treated with great inhumanity.’\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous of the early French ‘corsaires’, Thurot—who\r\nduring the Seven Years’ War made Ireland his base, and, acting with the\r\nmost admirable skill and audacity, caused almost as much loss and\r\nconsternation on this coast as did Paul Jones later—was at last brought\r\na prisoner into Liverpool on February 28, 1760.\r\n\r\nThe romance of Felix Durand, a Seven Years’ War prisoner at the Tower,\r\nis almost as interesting as that of Louis Vanhille, to which I devote a\r\nseparate chapter.\r\n\r\nThe wife of one P., an ivory carver and turner in Dale Street, and part\r\nowner of the _Mary Ellen_ privateer, had a curiously made foreign box\r\nwhich had been broken, and which no local workman could mend. The French\r\nprisoners were famous as clever and ingenious artisans, and to one of\r\nthem, Felix Durand, it was handed. He accepted the job, and wanted ample\r\ntime to do it in. Just as it should have been finished, fifteen\r\nprisoners, Durand among them, escaped from the Tower, but, having\r\nneither food nor money, and, being ignorant of English and of the\r\nlocalities round Liverpool, all, after wandering about for some time\r\nhalf-starved, either returned or were captured.\r\n\r\nSays Durand, describing his own part in the affair:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I am a Frenchman, fond of liberty and change, and I determined to make\r\nmy escape. I was acquainted with Mr. P. in Dale Street; I did work for\r\nhim in the Tower, and he has a niece who is _tout à fait charmante_. She\r\nhas been a constant ambassadress between us, and has taken charge of my\r\nmoney to deposit with her uncle on my account. She is very engaging, and\r\nwhen I have had conversation with her, I obtained from her the\r\ninformation that on the east side of our prison there were two houses\r\nwhich opened into a short narrow street [perhaps about Johnson Lane or\r\nOriel Chambers]. Mademoiselle is very kind and complacent, and examined\r\nthe houses and found an easy entrance into one.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, choosing a stormy night, the prisoners commenced by loosening the\r\nstone work in the east wall, and packing the mortar under their beds.\r\nThey were safe during the day, but once when a keeper did come round,\r\nthey put one of their party in bed, curtained the window grating with a\r\nblanket, and said that their compatriot was ill and could not bear the\r\nlight. So the officer passed on. At last the hole was big enough, and\r\none of them crept through. He reported an open yard, that it was raining\r\nheavily, and that the night was _affreuse_. They crept out one by one\r\nand got into the yard, whence they entered a cellar by the window,\r\ntraversed a passage or two, and entered the kitchen, where they made a\r\ngood supper, of bread and beef. While cutting this, one of them let fall\r\na knife, but nobody heard it, and, says Durand, ‘Truly you Englishmen\r\nsleep well!’\r\n\r\nFinally, as a neighbouring clock struck two, they managed to get past\r\nthe outer wall, and one man, sent to reconnoitre, reported: ‘not a soul\r\nto be seen anywhere, the wind rushing up the main street from the sea.’\r\n\r\nThey then separated. Durand went straight ahead, ‘passed the Exchange,\r\ndown a narrow lane [Dale Street] facing it, in which I knew Mademoiselle\r\ndwelt, but did not know the house; therefore I pushed on till I came to\r\nthe foot of a hill. I thought I would turn to the left at first, but\r\nwent on to take my chance of four cross roads—’ (Old Haymarket, Townsend\r\nLane, now Byron Street, Dale Street, and Shaw’s Brow, now William Brown\r\nStreet).\r\n\r\nHe went on until he came to the outskirts of Liverpool by Townsend Mill\r\n(at the top of London Road), and so on the road to Prescot, ankle-deep\r\nin mud. He ascended Edge Hill, keeping always the right-hand road, lined\r\non both sides with high trees, and at length arrived at a little village\r\n(Wavertree) as a clock struck three. Then he ate some bread and drank\r\nfrom a pond. Then onwards, always bearing to the right, on to ‘the\r\nquaint little village of Hale,’ his final objective being Dublin, where\r\nhe had a friend, a French priest.\r\n\r\nAt Hale an old woman came out of a cottage and began to take down the\r\nshutters. Durand, who, not knowing English, had resolved to play the\r\npart of a deaf and dumb man, quietly took the shutters from her, and\r\nplaced them in their proper position. Then he took a broom and swept\r\naway the water from the front of the door; got the kettle and filled it\r\nfrom the pump, the old woman being too astonished to be able to say\r\nanything, a feeling which was increased when her silent visitor raked\r\nthe cinders out of the grate, and laid the fire. Then she said something\r\nin broad Lancashire, but he signified that he was deaf and dumb, and he\r\nunderstood her so far as to know that she expressed pity. At this point\r\nhe sank on to a settle and fell fast asleep from sheer exhaustion from\r\nwalking and exposure. When he awakened he found breakfast awaiting him,\r\nand made a good meal. Then he did a foolish thing. At the sound of\r\nhorses’ hoofs he sprang up in alarm and fled from the house—an act\r\ndoubly ill-advised, inasmuch as it betrayed his affliction to be\r\nassumed, and, had his entertainer been a man instead of an old woman,\r\nwould assuredly have stirred the hue and cry after him.\r\n\r\nHe now took a wrong turning, and found himself going towards Liverpool,\r\nbut corrected his road, and at midday reached a barn where two men were\r\nthreshing wheat. He asked leave by signs to rest, which was granted. We\r\nshall now see how the native ingenuity of the Frenchman stood him in\r\ngood stead in circumstances where the average Englishman would have been\r\na useless tramp and nothing more. Seeing some fresh straw in a corner,\r\nDurand began to weave it into a dainty basket. The threshers stayed\r\ntheir work to watch him, and, when the article was finished, offered to\r\nbuy it. Just then the farmer entered, and from pity and admiration took\r\nhim home to dinner, and Durand’s first act was to present the basket to\r\nthe daughter of the house. Dinner finished, the guest looked about for\r\nwork to do, and in the course of the afternoon he repaired a stopped\r\nclock with an old skewer and a pair of pincers, mended a chair, repaired\r\na china image, cleaned an old picture, repaired a lock, altered a key,\r\nand fed the pigs!\r\n\r\nThe farmer was delighted, and offered him a barn to sleep in, but the\r\nfarmer’s daughter injudiciously expressed her admiration of him,\r\nwhereupon her sweetheart, who came in to spend the evening, signed to\r\nhim the necessity of his immediate departure.\r\n\r\nFor weeks this extraordinary man, always simulating a deaf-mute,\r\nwandered about, living by the sale of baskets, and was everywhere\r\nreceived with the greatest kindness.\r\n\r\nBut misfortune overtook him at length, although only temporarily. He was\r\nstanding by a very large tree, a local lion, when a party of visitors\r\ncame up to admire it, and a young lady expressed herself in very purely\r\npronounced French. Unable to restrain himself, Durand stepped forward,\r\nand echoed her sentiments.\r\n\r\n‘Why!’ exclaimed the lady. ‘This is the dumb man who was at the Hall\r\nyesterday repairing the broken vases!’\r\n\r\nThe result was that he was arrested as an escaped prisoner of war, sent\r\nfirst to Ormskirk, and then back to his old prison at the Liverpool\r\nTower.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a short time, through the influence of Sir Edward Cunliffe,\r\none of the members for Liverpool, he was released, and went to reside\r\nwith the P.’s in Dale Street. In the following September Mr. Durand and\r\nMiss P. became man and wife, and he remained in Liverpool many years, as\r\npartner in her uncle’s business.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Howard the philanthropist, in his tour through the prisons of\r\nBritain, visited the Liverpool Tower. He reported that there were\r\ntherein 509 prisoners, of whom fifty-six were Spaniards, who were kept\r\napart from the French prisoners, on account of racial animosities. All\r\nwere crowded in five rooms, which were packed with hammocks three tiers\r\nhigh. The airing ground was spacious. There were thirty-six invalids in\r\na small dirty room of a house at some distance from the prison. There\r\nwere no sheets on the beds, but the surgeons were attentive, and there\r\nwere no complaints.\r\n\r\nAt the prison, he remarked, the bedding required regulation. There was\r\nno table hung up of regulations or of the victualling rate, so that the\r\nprisoners had no means of checking their allowances. The meat and beer\r\nwere good, but the bread was heavy. The late Agent, he was informed, had\r\nbeen very neglectful of his duties, but his successor bore a good\r\ncharacter, and much was expected of him.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that most of the prisoners of war in Liverpool were\r\nprivateersmen. In 1779 Paul Jones was the terror of the local waters,\r\nand as his continual successes unsettled the prisoners and incited them\r\nto continual acts of mutiny and rebellion, and escapes or attempts to\r\nescape were of daily occurrence, a general shifting of prisoners took\r\nplace, many of the confined men being sent to Chester, Carlisle, and\r\nother inland towns, and the paroled men to Ormskirk and Wigan.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Sir George Saville and the Yorkshire Militia subscribed £50 to\r\nthe fund for the relief of the French and Spanish prisoners in\r\nLiverpool. The appeal for subscriptions wound up with the following\r\ncomplacent remark:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘And as the Town of Liverpool is already the Terror of our Foes, they\r\nwill by this means (at the time they acknowledge our Spirit and Bravery)\r\nbe obliged to reverence our Virtue and Humanity.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1781 the Rev. Gilbert Wakefield wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The American and French Wars had now been raging for some months, and\r\nseveral hundred prisoners of the latter nation had been brought into\r\nLiverpool by privateers. I frequently visited them in their confinement,\r\nand was much mortified and ashamed of their uniform complaints of hard\r\nusage and a scanty allowance of unwholesome provision. What I\r\noccasionally observed in my visits gave me but too much reason to\r\nbelieve the representations of this pleasing people, who maintained\r\ntheir national sprightliness and good humour undamped even in captivity.\r\nI was happy to learn later from the prisoners themselves the good\r\neffects of my interference, and the Commissary, the author of their\r\nwrongs, was presently superseded.... When I met him in the street later\r\nthere was fire in his eye, and fury in his face.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1793, the New Borough Gaol in Great Howard Street, (formerly Milk\r\nHouse Lane), which had been built in 1786, but never used, was made\r\nready for prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to the _Liverpool Courier_ of January 12, 1798, was\r\ncharacterized by _The Times_ as ‘emanating from some sanguinary Jacobin\r\nin some back garret of London’:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The French prisoners in the dungeons of Liverpool are actually\r\nstarving. Some time ago their usual allowance was lessened under\r\npretence of their having bribed the sentinels with the superfluity of\r\ntheir provisions. Each prisoner is allowed ½ lb. of beef, 1 lb. bread,\r\n&c., and as much water as he can drink. _The meat is the offal of the\r\nVictualling Office_—the necks and shanks of the butchered; the bread is\r\nso bad and so black as to incite disgust; and the water so brackish as\r\nnot to be drunken, and they are provided with straw. The officers,\r\ncontrary to the rule of Nations, are imprisoned with the privates, and\r\nare destined with them to experience the dampness and filth of these\r\ndismal and unhealthy dungeons. The privileges of Felons are not allowed\r\nthem. Philanthropos.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Mayor and Magistrates of Liverpool made minute inspection of the\r\nprison (which had been arranged in accordance with Howard’s\r\nrecommendations), and published a report which absolutely contradicted\r\nthe assertions of ‘Philanthropos’. There were, it said, six large\r\ndetached buildings, each of three stories, 106 feet long, twenty-three\r\nfeet high, and forty-seven feet wide; there were two kitchens, each\r\nforty-eight feet long, twenty feet broad, and thirteen feet high. In the\r\ntwo upper stories the prisoners slept in cells or separate compartments,\r\nnine feet long, seven feet broad, and eleven feet high, each with a\r\nglazed window, and in each were generally three or four, never more than\r\nfive, prisoners. The Hospital occupied two rooms, each thirty-three feet\r\nlong, thirty feet broad, and eleven feet high. The officer-prisoners,\r\nseventy in number, occupied a separate building, and the other\r\nprisoners, 1,250 in number, were in the five buildings. The mortality\r\nhere, from May 15 to December 31, 1798, among 1,332 prisoners was\r\ntwenty-six.\r\n\r\nRichard Brooke, in _Liverpool from 1775 to 1800_, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Amongst the amusements some of the French prisoners during their\r\nconfinement here performed plays in a small theatre contrived for that\r\npurpose within the walls, and in some instances they raised in a single\r\nnight £50 for admission money. Many of my readers will recollect that\r\nwith the usual ingenuity of the French the prisoners manufactured a\r\nvariety of snuff-boxes, rings, trinkets, crucifixes, card-boxes, and\r\ntoys which were exhibited in a stand at the entrance of the Gaol and\r\nsold for their benefit.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOne famous prisoner here was a Pole, named Charles Domery, whose\r\nvoracity was extraordinary. He ate anything. After the surrender of the\r\nfrigate on which he was captured he was so hungry that he was caught\r\ntearing the mangled limb of one of his fallen comrades. In one year he\r\nate 174 cats, some of them alive, besides dogs, rats, candles, and\r\nespecially raw meat. Although he was daily allowed the rations of ten\r\nmen, he was never satisfied. One day the prison doctor tested his\r\ncapacity, and at a sitting he ate fourteen pounds of raw meat and two\r\npounds of candles, and washed it all down with five bottles of porter.\r\nSome of the French prisoners used to upbraid him with his Polish\r\nnationality, and accuse him of disloyalty to the Republic. Once, in a\r\nfit of anger at this, he seized a knife, cut two wide gashes on his bare\r\narm, and with the blood wrote on the wall ‘Vive la République!’\r\n\r\nHe stood six feet two inches, was well made, and rather thin, and,\r\ndespite the brutality of his taste in food, was a very amiable and\r\ninoffensive man.\r\n\r\nThe following touching little letter was evidently written by a very\r\npoor prisoner whose wife shared his confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘De Livrepool: Ce 21 Septanbre 1757.\r\n\r\n‘Mon cher frere je vous dis ses deux mot pour vous dire que ma tres cher\r\nfemme à quitte ce monde pour aller à lotre monde; je vous prit de priyer\r\npour elle et de la recommender a tous nos bons paran.\r\n\r\n                                       ‘Je suis en pleuran votre\r\n                                           ‘Serviteur et frere\r\n                                                       ‘JOSEPH LE BLAN.’\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Brooke’s _Liverpool_ I also take the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A considerable number of prisoners were confined in the Borough Gaol, a\r\nmost ill-judged place of confinement when its contiguity to Coast and\r\nShipping, and the facilities afforded for escape of prisoners in case of\r\nthe appearance of an Enemy off the Coast are considered. In general the\r\nprisoners were ill clad and appeared dispirited and miserable, and the\r\nmortality among them was very considerable; the hearse was constantly in\r\nrequisition to convey from the Gaol the corpse of some poor Frenchman to\r\nthe public cemetery at St. John’s Church (where they were buried\r\nunmarked in a special corner set apart for felons and paupers). Soon\r\nafter the Peace of Amiens, 1802, eleven hundred were liberated, some of\r\nwhom had been there for years.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of these men had accumulated three hundred guineas by his\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nAs no book alludes to Liverpool as possessing a war-prison after 1802,\r\nit may be concluded that it ceased to have one after that date. This, I\r\nthink, is probable, as it was eminently unsuitable owing to its position\r\nand its proximity to disturbed Ireland.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                        6. GREENLAW—VALLEYFIELD\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half on the Edinburgh side of Penicuik, on the great\r\nsouth road leading to Peebles and Dumfries, is the military station of\r\nGlencorse, the dépôt of the Royal Scots Regiment. Until about ten years\r\nago the place was known as Greenlaw, but the name was changed owing to\r\npostal confusion with Greenlaw in Berwickshire.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, when, for many reasons, war-prisoners were hurried away from\r\nEngland to Scotland, the old mansion house of Greenlaw was bought by the\r\nGovernment and converted into a dépôt for 200 prisoners of war. It was\r\nsituated in the south-west corner of a park of sixty acres, and\r\nconsisted of a great square building, which was surrounded by a high\r\nwooden palisade, outside which was an airing ground, and space for the\r\nnecessary domestic offices, guard rooms, garrison quarters, and so\r\nforth, within an outer stone wall. Other buildings, chiefly in wood,\r\nwere added, and until 1811 it was the only Scottish war-prison south of\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nFor a year Greenlaw depended upon regulars from Edinburgh for its\r\ngarrison, but after 1805 the drain upon the army for foreign service was\r\nso great, that the Militia was again requisitioned to do duty at the\r\nwar-prisons. The garrison at Greenlaw consisted of one captain, four\r\nsubalterns, eight sergeants, four drummers, and 155 rank and file, the\r\nhead-quarters being at the Old Foundry in Penicuik. Discipline seems to\r\nhave been strict, and special attention was given to the appearance and\r\nturn-out of the men. Eleven sentries were on duty night and day, each\r\nman having six blank and six ball cartridges, the latter only to be used\r\nin case of serious need—a very necessary insistance, as the militiamen,\r\nalthough of a better class generally than their successors of recent\r\nyears, were more apt to be carried away by impulse than seasoned\r\nregulars. A private of the Stirling Militia was condemned in 1807 to\r\nreceive 800 lashes for being drunk and out of quarters after tattoo, for\r\nhaving struck his superior officer, and used mutinous language—and this\r\nwas a sentence mitigated on account of his previous good conduct and his\r\nexpression of regret.\r\n\r\nAfter the Peace of 1814, Greenlaw seems to have remained untenanted\r\nuntil 1846, when extensive buildings were added—mostly of wood—and it\r\nwas made the military prison for Scotland. This it continued to be until\r\n1888. In 1876 still further additions were made in a more substantial\r\nfashion, as it was decided to make it also the Scottish South Eastern\r\nMilitary Dépôt. In 1899 the old military prisons in wood were\r\ndemolished, and with them some of the original war-prison buildings, so\r\nthat all at present existing of the latter are the stone octagon Guard\r\nHouse, in the war-times used as the place of confinement for officers,\r\nand the line of building, now the married men’s quarters, then the\r\ngarrison officer’s quarters, and some of the original stone boundary\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the Government bought the Esk Mills at Valleyfield, and on\r\nFebruary 6, 1811, the first batch of 350 prisoners arrived. Building was\r\nrapidly pushed forward to provide accommodation for 5,000 prisoners at a\r\ncost of £73,000, the new war-prison being known as Valleyfield.\r\n\r\n‘About nine miles south of Edinburgh,’ says a writer in _Chambers’s\r\nJournal_ for 1887, ‘on the main road to Peebles, stands the village of\r\nPenicuik, for the most part built on the high road overlooking and\r\nsloping down the valley of the North Esk. Passing through the village,\r\nand down the slope leading to the bridge that spans the Esk and\r\ncontinues the road, we turn sharply to the left just at the bridge, and\r\na short distance below are the extensive paper-mills of Messrs.\r\nAlexander Cowan and Sons, called the Valleyfield Paper Mills.’\r\n\r\nI followed this direction, and under the courteous guidance of Mr. Cowan\r\nsaw what little remains of one of the most famous war-prisons of\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nUntil 1897 one of the original ‘casernes’ was used as a rag store. In\r\nAugust of that year this was pulled down. It measured 300 feet long,\r\n‘and its walls were eleven feet six inches thick.’[8] It had formed one\r\nof the first buildings at Glencorse. Valleyfield House, now the\r\nresidence of Mr. Cowan, was in the days of the war-prison used as the\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, during excavations for the new enamelling house at the Mills, a\r\ndozen coffins were unearthed, all with their heads to the east. The new\r\nbuildings of 1812 at Valleyfield consisted of six ‘casernes’, each from\r\n80 to 100 feet long, of three stories, built of wood, with openings\r\nclosed by strong wooden shutters. They were without fire-places, as it\r\nwas considered that the animal heat of the closely-packed inmates would\r\nrender such accessories unnecessary! The whole was surrounded by a stout\r\nwooden stockade, outside which was a carriage-road.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding apparent indifference to the comfort of the prisoners,\r\nthe mortality at Valleyfield during three years and four months was but\r\n309, being at the rate of 18·5 per mille, and in this is included a\r\nnumber of violent deaths from duels, quarrels, and the shooting of\r\nprisoners attempting to escape.\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful hillside garden of Valleyfield House is a monument,\r\nerected by Mr. Alexander Cowan, to the memory of these prisoners,\r\ninaugurated on June 26, 1830, the day on which George IV died. On it was\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The mortal remains of 309 prisoners of war who died in this\r\nneighbourhood between 21st March, 1811, and 26th July, 1814, are\r\ninterred near this spot.’\r\n\r\n‘Grata Quies Patriae: sed et Omnis Terra Sepulchrum.’ ‘Certain\r\ninhabitants of this parish, desiring to remember that all men are\r\nbrethren, caused this monument to be erected in the year 1830.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other side:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Près de ce Lieu reposent les cendres de 309 Prisonniers de Guerre morts\r\ndans ce voisinage entre le 21 Mars 1811 et le 26 Juillet 1814. Nés pour\r\nbénir les vœux de vieillissantes mères, par le sort appelés à devenir\r\namants, aimés époux et pères.\r\n\r\n‘Ils sont morts exilés. Plusieurs Habitants de cette Paroisse, aimant à\r\ncroire que tous les Hommes sont Frères, firent élever ce monument l’an\r\n1830.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that Sir Walter Scott, who showed a warm interest in the\r\nerection of the monument, suggested the Latin quotation, which is from\r\nSaumazarius, a poet of the Middle Ages. Despite the inscription, the\r\nmonument was raised at the _sole expense_ of Mr. Alexander Cowan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MONUMENT AT VALLEYFIELD TO PRISONERS OF WAR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn interesting episode is associated with this monument. In 1845, Mr.\r\nJohn Cowan of Beeslack, on a visit to the Paris Invalides, found an old\r\nValleyfield prisoner named Marcher, and on his return home sent the old\r\nsoldier a picture of the Valleyfield Memorial, and in the Cowan\r\nInstitute at Penicuik, amongst other relics of the war-prison days, is\r\nan appreciative letter from Marcher, dated from the Invalides, December\r\n1846.\r\n\r\nMarcher, when asked his experience of Valleyfield, said that it was\r\nterribly cold, that there were no windows, no warmth, no fruit, but that\r\nthe cabbages were very large. He lost an arm at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nThe guard consisted of infantry of the Ayr and Kircudbright militia and\r\nartillery, who had their camp on the high ground west of Kirkhill\r\nVillage. On one occasion an alarm that prisoners were escaping was\r\ngiven: the troops hurried to the scene of action, the artillery with\r\nsuch precipitancy that horses, guns, and men were rolled down the steep\r\nhill into the river, luckily without injuries.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to escape were as numerous here as elsewhere, and the Black\r\nHole, made of hewn ashlar work, never lacked occupants. One man, a\r\nsailor, it was impossible to keep within, and, like his fellow\r\ncountryman, Dufresne, at Portchester, was used to getting in and out\r\nwhen he liked, and might have got away altogether, but for his raids\r\nupon farm-houses and cottages around, which caused the natives to give\r\nhim up. On one occasion three prisoners rigged a false bottom to the\r\nprison dust-cart, hid themselves therein, and were conveyed out of the\r\nprison. When the cart stopped, the prisoners got out, and were entering\r\na wood, when a soldier met them. Him they cut at, and he, being unarmed,\r\nlet them go. They were, however, recaptured. On December 18, 1811,\r\nfourteen prisoners got out, but were all recaptured. One memorable\r\nattempt to get out by a tunnel from one of the original buildings, to\r\nanother in course of erection, and thence to the outer side of the\r\nstockade, was made in the same year. The tunnel was one hundred yards\r\nlong, and the enormous quantity of earth excavated was carried out in\r\nthe men’s pockets, dropped about on the airing ground, and trodden down.\r\nThe venture only failed owing to the first man mistaking the hour of\r\nday, and emerging before sunset, whereupon he was seen by a sentry and\r\nfired on.\r\n\r\nIt was at the daily market when the country people were brought into\r\nacquaintance with the prisoners, that many attempts to escape were made,\r\ndespite the doubling of the guards. One prisoner had arranged with the\r\ncarter who came every morning to take away the manure that he would\r\nconceal himself in the cart, keep himself covered up with the filth, and\r\nthus pass the sentries. The field where the rubbish was emptied was just\r\noutside the village, and the prisoner would know that it was time for\r\nhim to crawl out and run away when the cart halted. All started well;\r\nthe cart passed through the gate, and passed the first, second, and\r\nthird sentries, and was close to where the Free Church manse now stands,\r\nwhen a friend of the carter hailed him in a loud voice. The cart pulled\r\nup, and the poor prisoner, thinking that this was the signal, jumped\r\nout, and was shot down before he had gone many yards.\r\n\r\nAnother prisoner, by name Pirion, broke his parole, and was making his\r\nway to London by the coach road, and took shelter from the rain when he\r\nhad got as far south as Norman Cross, not knowing where he was. He was\r\nrecognized as an old Norman Cross prisoner, and was arrested and brought\r\nback.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 the report upon the condition of Valleyfield was very bad, and\r\nin particular it was recommended that a special stockade should be built\r\nto hide the half-naked prisoners from public view at the market.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 a Valleyfield prisoner was released in order that he might help\r\na Mr. Ferguson in the cod and herring fishery: almost as easy a release\r\nas that of the Norman Cross prisoner who was freed because he had\r\ninstructed the Earl of Winchester’s labourers at Burleigh, by Stamford,\r\nin the use of the Hainault scythe!\r\n\r\nAt one time very few of the prisoners at Valleyfield were Frenchmen.\r\nAbout twenty of them were allowed to live on parole outside the prison,\r\nand some of them enjoyed the friendship of the Cowan family; one in\r\nparticular, Ancamp, a Nantes merchant, had been a prisoner nine and a\r\nhalf years, and had had a son born to him since his capture, whom he had\r\nnever seen.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, Valleyfield was evacuated, and remained unoccupied until 1820,\r\nwhen, after having been advertised for sale and put up to auction\r\nseveral times without success, it was purchased by Cowan for £2,200.\r\n\r\nIn Penicuik many relics of the prisoners’ manufactures may still be\r\nseen, and what is now the public park was formerly the vegetable garden\r\nof the prison.\r\n\r\nAn elderly lady at Lasswade told Mr. Bresnil of Loanhead that she\r\nremembered in her childhood an old farmer who was pointed out as having\r\nmade his fortune by providing oatmeal to the prisoners at Valleyfield of\r\nan inferior quality to that for which he had contracted.\r\n\r\nI shall now give two accounts of life at these prisons. The first is by\r\nSergeant-Major Beaudouin, of the 31st Line Regiment, whom we have met\r\nbefore in this book on the hulks at Chatham. He was captured off Havana,\r\n26th Germinal, An XII, that is, on April 16, 1804, on board one of the\r\nsquadrons from St. Nicholas Mole, San Domingo, and brought via Belfast\r\nto Greenock, at which port he happened to arrive on June 4, in the midst\r\nof the celebrations of the King’s birthday. (It may be mentioned that he\r\nquitted England finally, eight years later, on the same day.) Bonaparte\r\nin effigy, on a donkey, was being paraded through the street preparatory\r\nto being burned, and the natives told him that they hoped some fine day\r\nto catch and burn Bonaparte himself, which upset Beaudouin and made him\r\nretort that despite all England’s strength France would never be\r\nconquered, and that 100,000 Frenchmen landed in England would be\r\nsufficient to conquer it, whereupon a disturbance ensued.\r\n\r\nBeaudouin landed at Port Glasgow, and thence to Renfrew and Glasgow, of\r\nwhich city he remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Cette ville paraît très grande et belle; costume très brillant. Ce\r\nqu’il y a de remarquable c’est que les paysans sont aussi bien mis comme\r\nceux de la ville; on ne peut en faire la différence que par le genre. Ce\r\nqui _jure_ beaucoup dans leur costume, c’est que les femmes marchent\r\npresque toujours nu-pieds. La quantité de belles femmes n’est pas\r\ngrande, comme on dit; en outre, en général elles out les bouches commes\r\ndes fours.’\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Glasgow the prisoners marched to Airdrie, ten miles, where the\r\npeople were affable. For the six prisoners there was an escort of a\r\nsergeant, a corporal, and eight men.\r\n\r\nFrom Airdrie they proceeded to Bathgate, fourteen miles, thence to\r\nEdinburgh, twenty-two miles, where they were lodged for the night in the\r\nguard-house of the Castle. From Edinburgh they came to Greenlaw, ten\r\nmiles, June 10, 1804.\r\n\r\nBeaudouin thus describes Greenlaw:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Cette prison est une maison de campagne. À deux milles où loge le\r\ndétachement qui nous garde est Penicuik. Cette maison est entourée de\r\ndeux rangs de palissades avec des factionnaires tout autour; à côté est\r\nsitué un petit bois qui favorise quelquefois des désertions.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first they were quartered with Dutch prisoners, but when peace was\r\nmade between Britain and Holland, these latter left.\r\n\r\nAt Greenlaw there were 106 French and 40 Spanish prisoners. The\r\nSpaniards were very antagonistic to the French, and also among\r\nthemselves, quarrelling freely and being very handy with their knives.\r\nBeaudouin gives many instances of their brutality. At call-over a\r\nSpaniard waited for another to come through the door, and stabbed him in\r\nthe face. An Italian and a Spaniard fought with knives until both were\r\nhelpless. Two Spaniards quarrelled about their soup, and fought in\r\npublic in the airing ground. The guard did not attempt to interfere—and\r\nwisely.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Les Espagnols,’ says Beaudouin, ‘possèdent toutes les bonnes qualités.\r\nPremièrement ils sont paresseux à l’excès, sales, traîtres, joueurs, et\r\nvoleurs comme des pies.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHe describes Valleyfield as cold, with very little fine weather, but\r\nhealthy. At the end of a week or so the newly arrived prisoners settled\r\nto work of different kinds. Some plaited straw for bonnets, some made\r\n_tresse cornue_ for baskets and hats; some carved boxes, games, &c.;\r\nsome worked hair watch-chains; some made coloured straw books and other\r\nknick-knacks, all of which they sold at the barriers.\r\n\r\nBeaudouin learned to plait straw, and at first found it difficult as his\r\nfingers were so big. The _armateur_, the employer, gave out the straw,\r\nand paid for the worked article three sous per ‘brasse’, a little under\r\nsix feet. Some men could make twelve ‘brasses’ a day. Beaudouin set to\r\nwork at it, and in the course of a couple of months became an adept.\r\nAfter four years came the remonstrance of the country people that this\r\nunderpaid labour by untaxed men was doing infinite injury to them; the\r\nGovernment prohibited the manufactures, and much misery among the\r\nprisoners resulted. From this prohibition resulted the outside practice\r\nof smuggling straw into the prison, and selling it later as the\r\nmanufactured article, and a very profitable industry it must have been,\r\nfor we find that, during the trial of Matthew Wingrave in 1813, for\r\nengaging in the straw-plait trade with the prisons at Valleyfield, it\r\ncame out that Wingrave, who was an extensive dealer in the article, had\r\nactually moved up there from Bedfordshire on purpose to carry on the\r\ntrade, and had bought cornfields for the purpose. The evidence showed\r\nthat he was in the habit of bribing the soldiers to keep their eyes\r\nshut, and that not a few people of character and position were\r\nassociated with him in the business.\r\n\r\nBeaudouin then learned to make horsehair rings with names worked into\r\nthem: these fetched sixpence each: rings in human hair were worth a\r\nshilling. For five years and a half he worked at this, and in so doing\r\ninjured his eyesight. ‘However,’ he said, ‘it kept me alive, which the\r\nrations would never have done.’\r\n\r\nNominally the clothing was renewed every year, but Beaudouin declares\r\nthat he had only one change in five and a half years. To prevent the\r\nclothes from being sold, they were of a sulphur-yellow colour.\r\n\r\n‘En un mot, les Anglais sont tous des brigands,’ he says, and continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have described many English atrocities committed in the Colonies;\r\nthey are no better here. In the prison they have practised upon us all\r\npossible cruelties. For instance, drum-beat was the signal for all\r\nlights to be put out, and if by chance the drum is not heard and the\r\nlights remain, the prisoners are fired upon without warning, and several\r\nhave been shot.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prisoners signed a petition about their miserable condition\r\ngenerally, and this outrage in particular, and sent it up to the\r\nTransport Board. Fifteen days later the Agent entered the prison\r\nfurious: ‘I must know who wrote that letter to the Government,’ he\r\nroared, ‘and I will put him into the _blokhall_ (Black Hole) until he\r\nsays who put it in the post.’\r\n\r\nIt ended in his being dismissed and severely punished. Ensign Maxwell of\r\nthe Lanark Militia, who had ordered the sentry to fire into the prison\r\nbecause a light was burning there after drum-beat, whereby a prisoner,\r\nCotier, was killed, was condemned to nine months’ imprisonment in the\r\nTolbooth. This was in 1807.[9] Many of the prisoners went to Edinburgh\r\nas witnesses in this case, and thereafter an order was posted up\r\nforbidding any firing upon the prisoners. If lights remained, the guard\r\nwas to enter the prison, and, if necessary, put the offenders into the\r\nBlack Hole, but no violence was to be used.\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 1809, all the French prisoners at Greenlaw were ordered to\r\nChatham, of which place very bad reports were heard from men who had\r\nbeen on the hulks there.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ils disent qu’ils sont plus mal qu’à Greenlaw. Premièrement, les vivres\r\nsont plus mauvais, excepté le pain qui est un peu meilleur: en outre,\r\naucun ouvrage ne se fait, et aucun bourgeois vient les voir. Je crains\r\nd’y aller. Dieu merci! Jusqu’à ce moment-ci je me suis monté un peu en\r\nlinge, car, quand je suis arrivé au prison mon sac ne me gênait point,\r\nles Anglais, en le prenant, ne m’ont laissé que ce que j’avais sur le\r\ndos. Quand je fus arrivé au prison ma chemise était pourrie sur mon dos\r\net point d’autre pour changer.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 31, 1809, Beaudouin left Greenlaw, where he had been since\r\nJune 10, 1804, for Sheerness, Chatham, and the _Bristol_ prison-ship.\r\n\r\nThe next reference to Greenlaw is from James Anton’s _A Military Life_.\r\nHe thus describes the prison at which he was on guard:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The prison was fenced round with a double row of stockades; a\r\nconsiderable space was appropriated as a promenade, where the prisoners\r\nhad freedom to walk about, cook provisions, make their markets and\r\nexercise themselves at their own pleasure, but under the superintendence\r\nof a turnkey and in the charge of several sentries.... The prisoners\r\nwere far from being severely treated: no work was required at their\r\nhands, yet few of them were idle. Some of them were occupied in culinary\r\navocations, and as the guard had no regular mess, the men on duty became\r\nready purchasers of their _labscuse_, salt-fish, potatoes, and coffee.\r\nOthers were employed in preparing straw for plaiting; some were\r\nmanufacturing the cast-away bones into dice, dominoes, paper-cutters,\r\nand a hundred articles of toy-work ... and realized considerable sums of\r\nmoney.... Those prisoners were well provided for in every respect, and\r\ntreated with the greatest humanity, yet to the eye of a stranger they\r\npresented a miserable picture of distress, while some of them were\r\nactually hoarding up money ... others were actually naked, with the\r\nexception of a dirty rag as an apron.... And strangers who visited the\r\nprison commiserated the apparent distress of this miserable class, and\r\ncharity was frequently bestowed on purpose to clothe their nakedness;\r\nbut no sooner would this set of despicables obtain such relief, than\r\nthey took to the cards, dice, or dominoes, and in a few hours were as\r\npoor and naked as ever.... When they were indulged with permission to\r\nremain in their hammocks, when the weather was cold, they drew the\r\nworsted out of the rags that covered them, wound it up in balls, and\r\nsold it to the industrious knitters of _mitts_, and left themselves\r\nwithout a covering by night. The inhabitants of Penicuik and its\r\nneighbourhood, previous to the establishment of this dépôt of prisoners,\r\nwere as comfortable and contented a class of people as in any district\r\nin Britain. The steep woody banks of the Esk were lined with prospering\r\nmanufactories.... When the militiamen were first quartered here, they\r\nmet with a welcome reception; ... in the course of a few years, those\r\nkindly people began to consider the quartering of soldiers upon them\r\nmore oppressive than they at first anticipated. Trade declined as\r\nprisoners increased.... One of the principal factories, Valleyfield, was\r\nafterwards converted into another dépôt for prisoners, and Esk Mills\r\ninto a barrack for the military; this gave a decisive blow to trade.’\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Robert Black, and indirectly to Mr. Howden, I am much indebted\r\nfor information about Greenlaw. To Mr. Cowan for helping me at\r\nValleyfield I have already expressed my obligation, but I must not omit\r\nto say that much of the foregoing information about Valleyfield and the\r\nEsk Mills has been taken from _The Reminiscences of Charles Cowan of\r\nLogan House, Midlothian_, printed for private circulation in 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                       7. STAPLETON, NEAR BRISTOL\r\n\r\nBristol, as being for so many centuries the chief port of western\r\nEngland, always had her full quota of prisoners of war, who, in the\r\nabsence of a single great place of confinement, were crowded away\r\nanywhere that room could be made for them. Tradition says that the crypt\r\nof the church of St. Mary Redcliff was used for this purpose, but it is\r\nknown that they filled the caverns under the cliff itself, and that\r\nuntil the great Fishponds prison at Stapleton, now the workhouse, was\r\nbuilt in 1782, they were quartered in old pottery works at Knowle, near\r\nTotterdown and Pile Hill, on the right-hand side of the road from\r\nBristol, on the south of Firfield House.\r\n\r\nIn volume XI of Wesley’s _Journal_ we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Monday, October 15, 1759, I walked up to Knowle, a mile from Bristol,\r\nto see the French prisoners. About eleven hundred of them, we were\r\ninformed, were confined in that little place, without anything to lie on\r\nbut a little dirty straw, or anything to cover them but a few foul thin\r\nrags, either by day or night, so that they died like rotten sheep. I was\r\nmuch affected, and preached in the evening, Exodus 23, verse 9. £18 was\r\ncontributed immediately, which was made up to £24 the next day. With\r\nthis we bought linen and woollen cloth, which was made up into shirts,\r\nwaistcoats, and breeches. Some dozens of stockings were added, all of\r\nwhich were carefully distributed where there was the greatest want.\r\nPresently after, the Corporation of Bristol sent a large quantity of\r\nmattresses and blankets, and it was not long before contributions were\r\nset on foot in London and in various parts of the Kingdom.’\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was to be the same story here as elsewhere of gambling being the\r\ncause of much of the nakedness and want, for he writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘October 24, 1760. I visited the French prisoners at Knowle, and found\r\nmany of them almost naked again. In hopes of provoking others to\r\njealousy I made another collection for them.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1779 John Howard visited Knowle on his tour of inspection of the\r\nprisoners of England. He reported that there were 151 prisoners there,\r\n‘in a place which had been a pottery’, that the wards were more spacious\r\nand less crowded than at the Mill Prison at Plymouth, and that in two of\r\nthe day rooms the prisoners were at work—from which remark we may infer\r\nthat at this date the industry which later became so notable a\r\ncharacteristic of the inmates of our war-prisons was not general. The\r\nbread, he says, was good, but there was no hospital, the sick being in a\r\nsmall house near the prison, where he found five men together in a dirty\r\nand offensive room.\r\n\r\nIn 1782 the prison at Fishponds, Stapleton, was built. Howard visited it\r\nin that year, and reported that there were 774 Spaniards and thirteen\r\nDutchmen in it, that there were no chimneys to the wards, which were\r\nvery dirty, as they were never washed, and that an open market was held\r\ndaily from 10 to 3. In 1794 there were 1,031 French prisoners at\r\nStapleton, of whom seventy-five were in hospital.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the ferment among the prisoners caused by reports of the success\r\nof Tate’s ‘invasion’ at Fishguard, developed into an open riot, during\r\nwhich a sentry fired and accidentally killed one of his comrades.\r\nTradition says that when the Bristol Volunteers were summoned to take\r\nthe place of the Militia, who had been hurried away to Fishguard, as\r\nthere could be found no arms for them, all the mop-sticks in Bristol\r\nwere bought up and furnished with iron heads, which converted them into\r\nvery respectable pikes. It was on this occasion that, in view of the\r\ndesperate feeling among the prisoners and the comparative inefficiency\r\nof their guards, it was suggested that all the prisoners should be\r\nlowered into the Kingswood coal-pits!\r\n\r\nIn 1799 the prison was enlarged at the contract price of £475; the work\r\nwas to be done by June 1800, and no Sunday labour was to be employed,\r\nalthough Sanders, of Pedlar’s Acre, Lambeth, the contractor, pleaded for\r\nit, as a ship, laden with timber for the prison, had sunk, and so\r\ndelayed the work.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 the following report upon the state of Stapleton Prison was\r\ndrawn up and published by two well-known citizens of Bristol, Thomas\r\nBatchelor, deputy-governor of St. Peter’s Hospital, and Thomas Andrews,\r\na poor-law guardian:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘On our entrance we were much struck with the pale, emaciated appearance\r\nof almost every one we met. They were in general nearly naked, many of\r\nthem without shoes and stockings, walking in the Courtyard, which was\r\nsome inches deep in mud, unpaved and covered with loose stones like the\r\npublic roads in their worst state. Their provisions were wretched\r\nindeed; the bread fusty and disagreeable, leaving a hot, pungent taste\r\nin the mouth; the meat, which was beef, of the very worst quality. The\r\nquantity allowed to each prisoner was one pound of this infamous bread,\r\nand ½ lb. of the carrion beef weighed with its bone before dressing, for\r\ntheir subsistence for 24 hours. No vegetables are allowed except to the\r\nsick in the hospital. We fear there is good reason for believing that\r\nthe prices given to the butcher and baker are quite sufficient for\r\nprocuring provisions of a far better kind. On returning to the outer\r\ncourt we were shocked to see two poor creatures on the ground leading to\r\nthe Hospital Court; the one lying at length, apparently dying, the other\r\nwith a horse-cloth or rug close to his expiring fellow prisoner as if to\r\ncatch a little warmth from his companion in misery. They appeared to be\r\ndying of famine. The majority of the poor wretches seemed to have lost\r\nthe appearance of human beings, to such skeletons were they reduced. The\r\nnumbers that die are great, generally 6 to 8 a day; 250 have died within\r\nthe last six weeks.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter so serious a statement made publicly by two men of position an\r\ninquiry was imperative, and ‘all the accusations were [it was said]\r\nshown to be unfounded’. It was stated that the deaths during the whole\r\nyear 1800 were 141 out of 2,900 prisoners, being a percentage of 4¾; but\r\nit was known that the deaths in November were forty-four, and in\r\nDecember thirty-seven, which, assuming other months to have been\r\nhealthier would be about 16 per cent., or nearly seven times the\r\nmortality even of the prison ships. The chief cause of disease and death\r\nwas said to be want of clothing, owing to the decision of the French\r\nGovernment of December 22, 1799, not to clothe French prisoners in\r\nEngland; but the gambling propensities of the prisoners had even more to\r\ndo with it. ‘It was true,’ said the Report of the Commission of Inquiry,\r\n‘that gambling was universal, and that it was not to be checked. It was\r\nwell known that here, as at Norman Cross, some of the worst gamblers\r\nfrequently did not touch their provisions for several days. The chief\r\nforms of gambling were tossing, and deciding by the length of straws if\r\nthe rations were to be kept or lost even for weeks ahead. This is the\r\ncause of all the ills, starvation, robbery, suicide, and murder.’ But it\r\nwas admitted that the chief medical officer gave very little personal\r\nattention to his duties, but left them to subordinates.\r\n\r\nIt was found that there was much exaggeration in the statements of\r\nMessrs. Batchelor and Andrews, but from a modern standard the evidence\r\nof this was by no means satisfactory. All the witnesses seem to have\r\nbeen more or less interested from a mercantile point of view in the\r\nadministration of the prison, and Mr. Alderman Noble, of Bristol, was\r\nnot ashamed to state that he acted as agent on commission for the\r\nprovision contractor, Grant of London.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Batchelor and Andrews afterwards publicly retracted their\r\naccusations, but the whole business leaves an unpleasant taste in the\r\nmouth, and one may make bold to say that, making due allowance for the\r\nembellishment and exaggeration not unnaturally consequent upon\r\ndeeply-moved sympathies and highly-stirred feelings, there was much\r\nground for the volunteered remarks of these two highly respectable\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, Lieutenant Ormsby, commander of the prison, wrote to the\r\nTransport Board:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Numbers of prisoners are as naked as they were previous to the clothing\r\nbeing issued. At first the superintendants were attentive and denounced\r\nmany of the purchasers of the clothing, but they gradually got careless.\r\nWe are still losing as many weekly as in the depth of winter. The\r\nhospital is crowded, and many are forced to remain outside who ought to\r\nbe in.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThis evidence, added to that of commissioners who reported that\r\ngenerally the distribution of provisions was unattended by any one of\r\nresponsible position, and only by turnkeys—men who were notoriously in\r\nleague with the contractors—would seem to afford some foundation for the\r\nabove-quoted report. About this time Dr. Weir, the medical inspection\r\nofficer of the Transport Board, tabulated a series of grave charges\r\nagainst Surgeon Jeffcott, of Stapleton, for neglect, for wrong treatment\r\nof cases, and for taking bribes from the prison contractors and from the\r\nprisoners. Jeffcott, in a long letter, denies these accusations, and\r\ndeclares that the only ‘presents’ he had received were ‘three sets of\r\ndominoes, a small dressing box, four small straw boxes, and a line of\r\nbattle ship made of wood,’ for which he paid. The result of the inquiry,\r\nhowever, was that he was removed from his post; the contractor was\r\nseverely punished for such malpractices as the using of false measures\r\nof the beer quart, milk quart, and tea pint, and with him was implicated\r\nLemoine, the French cook.\r\n\r\nThat the peculation at Stapleton was notorious seems to be the case, for\r\nin 1812 Mr. Whitbread in Parliament ‘heartily wished the French\r\nprisoners out of the country, since, under pretence of watching them, so\r\nmany abuses had been engendered at Bristol, and an enormous annual\r\nexpense was incurred.’\r\n\r\nIn 1804 a great gale blew down part of the prison wall, and an agitation\r\namong the prisoners to escape was at once noticeable. A Bristol Light\r\nHorseman was at once sent into the city for reinforcements, and in less\r\nthan four hours fifty men arrived—evidently a feat in rapid locomotion\r\nin those days!\r\n\r\nFrom the Commissioners’ Reports of these times it appears that the law\r\nprohibiting straw plaiting by the prisoners was much neglected at\r\nStapleton, that a large commerce was carried on in this article with\r\noutside, chiefly through the bribery of the soldiers of the guard, who\r\ndid pretty much as they liked, which, says the report, was not to be\r\nwondered at when the officers of the garrison made no scruple of buying\r\nstraw-plaited articles for the use of their families.\r\n\r\nAs to the frequent escapes of prisoners, one potent cause of this, it\r\nwas asserted, was that in wet weather the sentries were in the habit of\r\nclosing the shutters of their boxes so that they could only see straight\r\nahead, and it was suggested that panes of glass be let in at the sides\r\nof the boxes.\r\n\r\nThe provisions for the prisoners are characterized as being ‘in general’\r\nvery good, although deep complaints about the quality of the meat and\r\nbread are made.\r\n\r\n‘The huts where the provisions are cooked have fanciful inscriptions\r\nover their entrances, which produce a little variety and contribute to\r\namuse these unfortunate men.’\r\n\r\nAll gaming tables in the prison were ordered to be destroyed, because\r\none man who had lost heavily threw himself off a building and was\r\nkilled; but billiard tables were allowed to remain, only to be used by\r\nthe better class of prisoners. The hammocks were condemned as very bad,\r\nand the issue of the fish ration was stopped, as the prisoners seemed to\r\ndislike it, and sold it.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 the new prison at Stapleton was completed, and accommodation for\r\n3,000 additional prisoners afforded, making a total of 5,000. Stapleton\r\nwas this year reported as being the most convenient prison in England,\r\nand was the equivalent of eight prison-ships.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 the complaints about the straw-plaiting industry clandestinely\r\ncarried on by the Stapleton prisoners were frequent, and also that the\r\nprison market for articles manufactured by the prisoners was prejudicial\r\nto local trade.\r\n\r\nDuelling was very frequent among the prisoners. On March 25, 1808, a\r\ndouble duel took place, and two of the fighters were mortally wounded. A\r\nverdict of manslaughter was returned against the two survivors by the\r\ncoroner’s jury, but at the Gloucester assizes the usual verdict of\r\n‘self-defence’ was brought in. In July 1809 a naval and a military\r\nofficer quarrelled over a game of marbles; a duel was the result, which\r\nwas fought with sticks to which sharpened pieces of iron had been fixed,\r\nand which proved effective enough to cause the death of one of the\r\ncombatants. A local newspaper stated that during the past three years no\r\nless than 150 duels had been fought among the prisoners at Stapleton,\r\nthe number of whom averaged 5,500, and that the coroner, like his\r\n_confrères_ at Dartmoor and Rochester, was complaining of the extra work\r\ncaused by the violence of the foreigners.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 a warder at Stapleton Prison was dismissed from his post for\r\nhaving connived at the conveyance of letters to Colonel Chalot, who was\r\nin prison for having violated his parole at Wantage by going beyond the\r\nmile limit to meet an English girl, Laetitia Barrett. Laetitia’s letters\r\nto him, in French, are at the Record Office, and show that the Colonel\r\nwas betrayed by a fellow prisoner, a rival for her hand.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 the Bristol shoemakers protested against the manufacture of list\r\nshoes by the Stapleton prisoners, but the Government refused to issue\r\nprohibiting orders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STAPLETON PRISON\r\n\r\n  _From the Gentleman’s Magazine_, 1814\r\n]\r\n\r\nForgery was largely practised at Stapleton as in other prisons, and in\r\nspite of warnings posted up, the country people who came to the prison\r\nmarket were largely victimized, but Stapleton is particularly associated\r\nwith the wholesale forgery of passports in the year 1814, by means of\r\nwhich so many officer prisoners were enabled to get to France on the\r\nplea of fidelity to the restored Government. In this year a Mr. Edward\r\nProthero of 39, Harley Street, Bristol, sent to the Transport Office\r\ninformation concerning the wholesale forgery of passports, in the sale\r\nof which to French officers a Madame Carpenter, of London (already\r\nmentioned in Chapter VI), was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe signing of the Treaty of Paris, on May 30, 1814, stopped whatever\r\nproceedings might have been taken by the Government with regard to\r\nMadame Carpenter, but it appears that some sort of inquiry had been\r\ninstituted, and that Madame Carpenter, although denying all traffic in\r\nforged passports, admitted that she was on such terms with the Transport\r\nBoard on account of services rendered by her in the past when residing\r\nin France to British prisoners there, as to be able to ask favours of\r\nit. The fact is, people of position and influence trafficked in\r\npassports and privileges, just as people in humbler walks of life\r\ntrafficked in contracts for prisons and in the escape of prisoners, and\r\nMadame Carpenter was probably the worker, the business transactor, for\r\none or more persons in high place who, even in that not particularly\r\nshamefaced age, did not care that their names should be openly\r\nassociated with what was just as much a business as the selling of legs\r\nof mutton or pounds of tea.\r\n\r\nIn spite of what we have read about the misery of life at Stapleton, it\r\nseems to have been regarded by prisoners elsewhere as rather a superior\r\nsort of place. At Dartmoor, in 1814, the Americans hailed with delight\r\nthe rumour of their removal to Stapleton, well and healthily situated in\r\na fertile country, and, being near Bristol, with a good market for\r\nmanufactures, not to speak of its being in the world, instead of out of\r\nit, as were Dartmoor and Norman Cross; and the countermanding order\r\nalmost produced a mutiny.\r\n\r\nIt appears that dogs were largely kept at Stapleton by the prisoners,\r\nfor after one had been thrown into a well it was ordered that all should\r\nbe destroyed, the result being 710 victims! They were classed as ‘pet’\r\ndogs, but one can hardly help suspecting that men in a chronic state of\r\nhunger would be far more inclined to make the dogs feed them than to\r\nfeed dogs as fancy articles.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to read that, notwithstanding the utter irreligion of\r\nso many French prisoners in Britain, in more than one prison, at Millbay\r\nand Stapleton for instance, Mass was never forgotten among them. At\r\nStapleton an officer of the fleet, captured at San Domingo, read the\r\nprayers of the Mass usually read by the priest; an altar was painted on\r\nthe wall, two or three cabin-boys served as acolytes, as they would have\r\ndone had a priest been present, and there was no ridicule or laughter at\r\nthe celebrations.\r\n\r\nAfter the declaration of peace in 1815, the _raison d’être_ of Stapleton\r\nas a war-prison of course ceased. In 1833 it was bought by the Bristol\r\nPoor-Board and turned into a workhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                       8. FORTON, NEAR PORTSMOUTH\r\n\r\nAlthough the Fortune Prison, as it seems to have been very generally\r\ncalled, had been used for war-prisoners during the Seven Years’ War, its\r\nregular adaptation to that purpose was probably not before 1761, in\r\nwhich year 2,000 prisoners were removed thither from Portchester\r\n‘guarded by the Old Buffs’. During the War of American Independence many\r\nprisoners of that nationality were at Forton, and appear to have been\r\nceaselessly engaged in trying to escape. In 1777 thirty broke out, of\r\nwhom nineteen were recaptured and were so harshly punished that they\r\ncomplained in a letter which somehow found its way into the London\r\npapers. The next year, the Westminster Militia, encamped on Weovil\r\nCommon, attracted by alarm guns at Forton, marched thither, and found\r\nAmerican and French prisoners escaping through a hole in the outer wall,\r\nbut were too late to prevent five-and-twenty from getting away\r\naltogether. The attempt was supposed to be the sequel of a plot by\r\nwhich, a fortnight previously, eleven Americans had escaped. On the same\r\nday there was a mutiny in the prison hospital, provoked, it was alleged,\r\nby the neglect and the callous treatment of patients by the doctors and\r\ntheir subordinates.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1778, another batch of no less than fifty-seven\r\nAmericans made a desperate attempt to get out. The Black Hole at Forton\r\nwas underneath part of the prisoners’ sleeping quarters. A hole large\r\nenough for the passage of a man was made in the floor of a sleeping\r\nroom, being covered by a bed—that is, a mattress—and through this the\r\nearth from a tunnel which led from the Black Hole to beyond the prison\r\nwalls, was brought and hidden in the chimney and in hammocks until\r\nopportunities came for its removal elsewhere. As no report was published\r\nof the recapture of these men, we may presume that they got away.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Howard made his report upon Forton. He found there 251 Americans\r\nand 177 Frenchmen. The condition of the former, he says, was\r\nsatisfactory—probably a result of the generous public subscription of\r\nthe previous year in aid of them.\r\n\r\nOf the French part of the prison he speaks badly. The meat was bad, the\r\nbread loaves were of short weight, the straw in the mattresses had been\r\nreduced to dust by long use, and many of them had been emptied to clear\r\nthem of vermin. The floors of the hospital and the sleeping quarters,\r\nwhich were laid rough, were dirty and offensive.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners complained to Howard, who told them to write to the\r\nCommissioners of the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office. They replied that, as every\r\nletter had to be examined by the Agent, this would be of no good.\r\n\r\nHoward emphasizes severely the evident roguery of the contractors\r\nemployed in the furnishing of provisions and clothing.\r\n\r\nThe year 1793 was marked at Forton, as elsewhere, by a general\r\ninsubordinate feeling among the Frenchmen, of whom there were 850 in the\r\nprison. In April, a sentry on guard outside the palisade heard a\r\nmysterious scraping sound beneath his feet, and gave the alarm.\r\nExamination revealed two loose planks in one of the sleeping-rooms,\r\nwhich, being taken up, exposed the entrance to a tunnel, afterwards\r\nfound to run twenty-seven feet to the outer side of the palisade. One of\r\nthe prisoners confessed that a plot had been made to kill the Agent and\r\nhis officers.\r\n\r\nIn July the following report was made upon Forton:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The French at Forton continue extremely restless and turbulent, and\r\ncannot bear their captivity with moderation and temper though they are\r\nexceedingly well supplied with provisions and every necessity their\r\nsituation requires. A sailor made a desperate attempt to disarm a\r\nsentinel through the bar of the compartment where he was confined. The\r\nsentry with great exertion disengaged himself, and fired at the\r\noffender, but wounded unfortunately another prisoner, not the aggressor.\r\nFriday se’nnight, the guard discovered a plot by which several prisoners\r\nhad planned an escape over the wall by tying together their hammocks and\r\nblankets. The sentry on duty fired in at the windows, and hit one of the\r\nrioters, who is since dead.\r\n\r\n‘Three French prisoners were dangerously wounded while endeavouring to\r\nescape from Forton. One of them with a drawn knife rushed upon the\r\nguard, a private of the Anglesea Militia, who fired at him. The\r\nFrenchman seized him by the coat, whereupon the guard ran the offender\r\nthrough the body.’\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Hyde, the Commandant at Portsmouth, ordered, in consequence of\r\nthe insubordination fomented by the French political excitement of the\r\ntime, that no prisoners should be allowed to wear the national cockade,\r\nor to scribble seditious statements on the prison walls, or to play any\r\nnational music, under penalty of the _cachot_. It is almost unnecessary\r\nto say that the enforcement of these orders was physically impossible.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 an epidemic at Forton caused the deaths of 200 prisoners in one\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 the great amount of sickness at Forton brought about an official\r\ninquiry, the result of which was the superseding of the head surgeon.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, a fire broke out one day in the prison at 2 p.m., which\r\ncontinued until 9 a.m. The prisoners behaved very well, helping to put\r\nthe fire out, and not attempting to escape.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1810, no less than 800 prisoners were on the sick list.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, Sous-lieutenant Doisy de Villargennes, of the 26th French line\r\nregiment, arrived at Portsmouth, a prisoner of war, taken after Fuentes\r\nd’Oñoro, and was allowed to be on parole ashore pending his dispatch to\r\nan inland parole town. He knew that his foster-brother was in prison at\r\nForton, and got leave to visit him. I am particularly glad to give the\r\ntestimony of a French prisoner of war to the improved state of\r\naffairs—at Forton, at any rate. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Il y régnait l’ordre le plus parfait, sous un règlement sévère mais\r\nhumain. Nous n’entendîmes pas de sanglots de désespoir, nous ne vîmes\r\npoint la tristesse dans les yeux des habitants, mais de tous côtés, au\r\ncontraire, c’étaient des éclats de rire ou des chansons patriotiques qui\r\nrésonnaient. . . . Mon frère de lait me conduisit vers un petit coin\r\nconfortable qu’il occupait en compagnie d’un camarade. J’y remarquai un\r\nlit de bonne apparence, ainsi que d’autres meubles modestes qu’ils\r\navaient pu acheter avec leur propre argent. La cuisine occupait le\r\ncompartiment voisin; elle servait à 200 hommes, et l’odeur qu’elle\r\nrépandait ne faisait nullement présumer que les habitants pussent être\r\naffamés. Je restai à dîner. Je ne dirai pas que le repas était\r\nsomptueux, mais les mets étaient suffisants et de bonne qualité, et bien\r\nque servis dans des plats et assiettes d’étain, avec des couteaux et des\r\nfourchettes du même métal, ils étaient accompagnés d’une si cordiale\r\nréception que le souvenir de ce dîner m’a toujours laissé sous une\r\nagréable impression.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were no wines or liqueurs, but abundance of ‘the excellent ale\r\nwhich England alone produces’. Doisy asked whence came the money to pay\r\nfor all this abundance. His host told him that, being a basket-maker’s\r\nson, and knowing the trade, he got permission to work at it and to sell\r\nhis goods. For a time this was very successful, but the large output of\r\ncheap, untaxed work from the prison brought remonstrance from the\r\nstraw-workers of Portsmouth, Barnstaple, and other places, with the\r\nresult that Government prohibited it. But the ingenious Frenchman soon\r\nfound another string for his bow, and he became, with many others, a\r\nmanufacturer of ornaments and knick-knacks, boxes, combs, toys, and\r\nespecially ship models, from the bones of his food. These beef and\r\nmutton bones were carefully saved on all sides, and those who could not\r\nwork them, sold them at good prices to those who could. Germain Lamy,\r\nhis foster-brother, told Doisy that he and his comrade worked at the\r\nbone model of a seventy-four, with rigging made of hair, for six months,\r\nand sold it for £40.\r\n\r\nLamy was released at the peace of 1814. He took back to France 16,500\r\nfrancs; bought a little farm, married, and settled down, but died of\r\ncholera in 1832.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 took place the ‘Brothers murder,’ a crime which made a very\r\ngreat and lasting sensation.\r\n\r\nThree Frenchmen—François Relif, Jean Marie Dauze, and Daniel du Verge,\r\nescaped from Forton, and engaged George Brothers, a pilot and boatman,\r\nto take them, they said, from the Point to one of the ships at Spithead.\r\nOff the Block-House they told him that they intended to escape, and\r\nproposed that he should take them over to France. He refused: they\r\nthreatened, but he persisted and tried to signal the shipping. Whereupon\r\nthey attacked him, stabbed him in sixteen places, threw his body\r\noverboard, and set their course seaward. This was seen from the shore, a\r\nfleet of boats set off in pursuit, and, after a smart chase—one account\r\nsays of fifteen miles—the fugitives were captured, although it was\r\nthought that they would have escaped had they known how to manage a\r\nsailing boat. They were taken on board H.M.S. _Centaur_, searched, and\r\nupon them were found three knives and a large sum of money. They were\r\ntaken then to jail ashore. One of the prisoners was found to have thirty\r\ncrown pieces concealed about him, and confessed that having saved up\r\nthis money, which he had made by the sale of lace, toys, and other\r\nmanufactures, he had bought a suit of decent clothes, and, mixing with\r\nvisitors to the dépôt, thus disguised had got off. In the meanwhile the\r\nbody of Brothers had been recovered, placed first in one of the\r\ncasemates of Point Battery, and then taken amidst an enormous crowd to\r\nhis house in Surrey Street, Landport.\r\n\r\nThe three murderers were executed at Winchester. The funeral of Brothers\r\nin Kingston churchyard was the occasion of a large public demonstration,\r\nand, be it recorded, the prisoners at Forton expressed their abhorrence\r\nof the crime by getting up a subscription for the murdered man’s widow\r\nand children, to which it is said one of the murderers contributed £7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                       9. MILLBAY, NEAR PLYMOUTH\r\n\r\nSaxon prisoners taken at Leuthen were at the ‘New Prison,’ Plymouth, in\r\n1758. In this year they addressed a complaint to the authorities,\r\npraying to be sent elsewhere, as they were ostracized, and even reviled,\r\nby the French captives, and a round-robin to the officer of the guard,\r\nreminding him that humanity should rule his actions rather than a mere\r\ndelight in exercising authority, and hinting that officers who had made\r\nwar the trade of their lives probably knew more about its laws than Mr.\r\nTonkin, the Commissioner in charge of them, appeared to know.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 no less than 150 prisoners contrived to tunnel their way out of\r\nthe prison, but all except sixteen were recaptured.\r\n\r\nOf the life at the old Mill Prison, as it was then called, during the\r\nWar of American Independence, a detailed account is given by Charles\r\nHerbert of Newburyport, Massachusetts, captured in the _Dolton_, in\r\nDecember 1776, by H.M.S. _Reasonable_, 64.\r\n\r\nWith his sufferings during the voyage to England we have nothing to do,\r\nexcept that he was landed at Plymouth so afflicted with ‘itch’, which\r\ndeveloped into small-pox, that he was at once taken to the Royal\r\nHospital. It is pleasing to note that he speaks in the highest terms of\r\nthe care and kindness of the doctor and nurses of this institution.\r\n\r\nWhen cured he was sent to Mill Prison, and here made money by carving in\r\nwood of boxes, spoons and punch ladles, which he sold at the Sunday\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nVery soon the Americans started the system of tunnelling out of the\r\nprison, and attempting to escape, which only ceased with their final\r\ndischarge. Herbert was engaged in the scheme of an eighteen feet long\r\nexcavation to a field outside, the earth from which, they rammed into\r\ntheir sea-chests. By this, thirty-two men got out, but eleven were\r\ncaptured, he being one.\r\n\r\nMen who could make no articles for sale in the market sold their clothes\r\nand all their belongings.\r\n\r\nTheft among the prisoners was punished by the offenders being made to\r\nrun the gauntlet of their comrades, who were armed with nettles for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nHerbert complains bitterly of the scarcity and quality of the\r\nprovisions, particularly of the bread, which he says was full of\r\nstraw-ends. ‘Many are tempted to pick up the grass in the yard and eat\r\nit; and some pick up old bones that have been laying in the dirt a week\r\nor ten days and pound them to pieces and suck them. Some will pick\r\nsnails out of holes in the wall and from among the grass and weeds in\r\nthe yard, boil them, eat them, and drink the broth. Men run after the\r\nstumps of cabbages thrown out by the cooks into the yard, and trample\r\nover each other in the scuffle to get them.’\r\n\r\nChristmas and New Year were, however, duly celebrated, thanks to the\r\ngenerosity of the prison authorities, who provided the materials for two\r\nhuge plum-puddings, served out white bread instead of the regulation\r\n‘Brown George’, mutton instead of beef, turnips instead of cabbage, and\r\noatmeal.\r\n\r\nThen came a time of plenty. In London £2,276 was subscribed for the\r\nprisoners, and £200 in Bristol. Tobacco, soap, blankets, and extra bread\r\nfor each mess were forthcoming, although the price of tobacco rose to\r\nfive shillings a pound. Candles were expensive, so marrow-bones were\r\nused instead, one bone lasting half as long as a candle.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 1778, five officers—Captains Henry and Eleazar Johnston,\r\nOffin Boardman, Samuel Treadwell, and Deal, got off with two sentries\r\nwho were clothed in mufti, supplied by Henry Johnston. On February 17,\r\nthe two soldiers were taken, and were sentenced, one to be shot and the\r\nother to 700 lashes, which punishment was duly carried out. Of the\r\nofficers, Treadwell was recaptured, and suffered the usual penalty of\r\nforty days Black Hole, and put on half allowance. Continued attempts to\r\nescape were made, and as they almost always failed it was suspected that\r\nthere were traitors in the camp. A black man and boy were discovered:\r\nthey were whipped, and soon after, in reply to a petition from the\r\nwhites, all the black prisoners were confined in a separate building,\r\nknown as the ‘itchy yard.’\r\n\r\nStill the attempts continued. On one occasion two men who had been told\r\noff for the duty of emptying the prison offal tubs into the river, made\r\na run for it. They were captured, and among the pursuers was the prison\r\nhead-cook, whose wife held the monopoly of selling beer at the prison\r\ngate, the result being that she was boycotted.\r\n\r\nMuch complaint was made of the treatment of the sick, extra necessaries\r\nbeing only procurable by private subscription, and when in June 1778,\r\nthe chief doctor died, Herbert writes: ‘I believe there are not many in\r\nthe prison who would mourn, as there is no reason to expect that we can\r\nget a worse one.’\r\n\r\nOn Independence Day, July 4, all the Americans provided themselves with\r\ncrescent-shaped paper cockades, painted with the thirteen stars and\r\nthirteen stripes of the Union, and inscribed at the top ‘Independence’,\r\nand at the bottom ‘Liberty or Death’. At one o’clock they paraded in\r\nthirteen divisions. Each in turn gave three cheers, until at the\r\nthirteenth all cheered in unison.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of a section of blackguards in the community gave rise to\r\nfears that it would lead to the withdrawal of charitable donations. So\r\narticles were drawn up forbidding, under severe penalties, gambling,\r\n‘blackguarding’, and bad language. This produced violent opposition, but\r\ngradually the law-abiders won the day.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious attempt to escape is mentioned by Herbert. Part of the\r\nprison was being repaired by workmen from outside. An American saw the\r\ncoat and tool-basket of one of these men hanging up, so he appropriated\r\nthem, and quietly sauntered out into the town unchallenged. Later in the\r\nday, however, the workman recognized his coat on the American in the\r\nstreets of Plymouth, and at once had him arrested and brought back.\r\n\r\nOn December 28, 1778, Herbert was concerned in a great attempt to\r\nescape. A hole nine feet deep was dug by the side of the inner wall of\r\nthe prison, thence for fifteen feet until it came out in a garden on the\r\nother side of the road which bounded the outer wall. The difficulty of\r\ngetting rid of the excavated dirt was great, and, moreover, excavation\r\ncould only be proceeded with when the guard duty was performed by the\r\nMilitia regiment, which was on every alternate day, the sentries of the\r\n13th Regular regiment being far too wideawake and up to escape-tricks.\r\nHalf the American prisoners—some two hundred in number—had decided to\r\ngo. All was arranged methodically and without favour, by drawing lots,\r\nthe operation being conducted by two chief men who did not intend to go.\r\n\r\nHerbert went with the first batch. There were four walls, each eight\r\nfeet high, to be scaled. With five companions Herbert managed these, and\r\ngot out, their aim being to make for Teignmouth, whence they would take\r\nboat for France. Somehow, as they avoided high roads, and struck across\r\nfields, they lost their bearings, and after covering, he thinks, at\r\nleast twenty miles, sat down chilled and exhausted, under a haystack\r\nuntil daybreak. They then restarted, and coming on to a high road,\r\nlearned from a milestone that, after all, they were only three miles\r\nfrom Plymouth!\r\n\r\nDay came, and with it the stirring of the country people. To avoid\r\nobservation, the fugitives quitted the road, and crept away to the\r\nshelter of a hedge, to wait, hungry, wet, and exhausted, during nine\r\nhours, for darkness. The end soon came.\r\n\r\nIn rising, Herbert snapped a bone in his leg. As it was being set by a\r\ncomrade, a party of rustics with a soldier came up, the former armed\r\nwith clubs and flails. The prisoners were taken to a village, where they\r\nhad brandy and a halfpenny cake each, and taken back to Plymouth.\r\n\r\nAt the prison they learned that 109 men had got out, of whom thirty had\r\nbeen recaptured. All had gone well until a boy, having stuck on one of\r\nthe walls, had called for help, and so had given the alarm. Altogether\r\nonly twenty-two men escaped. Great misery now existed in the prison,\r\npartly because the charitable fund had been exhausted which had hitherto\r\nso much alleviated their lot, and partly on account of the number of men\r\nput on half allowance as a result of their late escape failure, and so\r\nscanty was food that a dog belonging to one of the garrison officers was\r\nkilled and eaten.\r\n\r\nHerbert speaks in glowing terms of the efforts of two American\r\n‘Fathers’, Heath and Sorry, who were allowed to visit the prison, to\r\nsoften the lot of the captives.\r\n\r\nFinally, on March 15, 1779, Herbert was exchanged after two years and\r\nfour months’ captivity.\r\n\r\nIn a table at the end of his account, he states that between June 1777,\r\nand March 1779, there were 734 Americans in Mill Prison, of whom\r\nthirty-six died, 102 escaped, and 114 joined the British service. Of\r\nthese last, however, the majority were British subjects.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Howard reported that there were 392 French and 298 American\r\nprisoners in Millbay. He noted that neither the wards nor the\r\ncourt-yards apportioned to the Frenchmen were so spacious and convenient\r\nas were those in the American part of the prison, nor were the\r\nprovisions so good. In the hospital there were fifty patients; it was\r\ndirty and offensive, and Howard found only three pairs of sheets in use.\r\n\r\n(Herbert, above quoted, said that the hospital was not worthy of the\r\nname, that when it rained the wet beat upon the patients as they lay in\r\ntheir beds.)\r\n\r\nA new hospital was building, Howard continues, but he considered the\r\nwards were being made too low and too close, being seventeen feet ten\r\ninches wide, and ten feet high. In the American blocks the regulations\r\nwere hung up according to rule, and he notes Article 5 of these to the\r\neffect that: ‘As water and tubs for washing their linen and clothes will\r\nbe allowed, the prisoners are advised to keep their persons as clean as\r\npossible, it being conducive to health.’\r\n\r\nI now make an extract from _The Memoirs of Commodore Barney_, published\r\nin Boston, 1832, chiefly on account of his stirring escape from Millbay,\r\ntherein described.\r\n\r\nBarney was captured in December 1780 by H.M.S. _Intrepid_, Captain\r\nMalloy, whom he stigmatizes as the embodiment of all that is brutal in\r\nman. He was carried to England on the _Yarmouth, 74_, with seventy other\r\nAmerican officers. They were confined, he says, in the hold, under three\r\ndecks, twelve feet by twenty feet, and three feet high, without light\r\nand almost without air. The result was that during the fifty-three days’\r\npassage in the depths of winter, from New York to Plymouth, eleven of\r\nthem died, and that when they arrived at Plymouth, few of them were able\r\nto stand, and all were temporarily blinded by the daylight.\r\n\r\nIt sounds incredible, but Mrs. Barney, the editress of the volume, says:\r\n‘What is here detailed is given without adornment or exaggeration,\r\nalmost in the very words of one who saw and suffered just as he has\r\ndescribed.’\r\n\r\nBarney was sent first to a hulk, which he describes as a Paradise when\r\ncompared with the _Yarmouth_, and as soon as they could walk, he and his\r\ncompanions went to Mill Prison, ‘as rebels.’\r\n\r\nHe lost no time in conspiring to escape. With infinite pains he and\r\nothers forced their way through the stone walls and iron gratings of the\r\ncommon sewer, only to find, after wading through several hundred feet of\r\nfilth, their exit blocked by a double iron grating. He then resolved to\r\nact independently, and was suddenly afflicted by a sprain which put him\r\non crutches. He found a sympathetic friend in a sentry who, for some\r\nreason or other, had often manifested friendship for the American\r\nprisoners. This man contrived to obtain for him a British officer’s\r\nundress uniform. One day Barney said to him, ‘To-day?’ to which the\r\nlaconic reply was ‘Dinner’, by which Barney understood that his hours on\r\nduty would be from twelve till two.\r\n\r\nBarney threw his old great coat over the uniform; arranged with his\r\nfriends to occupy the other sentries’ attention by chaff and chat;\r\nengaged a slender youth at roll-call time to carry out the old trick of\r\ncreeping through a hole in the wall and answer to Barney’s name as well\r\nas his own; and then jumped quickly on to the shoulders of a tall friend\r\nand over the wall.\r\n\r\nThrowing away his great-coat, he slipped four guineas into the\r\naccomplice sentry’s hand, and walked quietly off into Plymouth to the\r\nhouse of a well-known friend to the American cause. No little alarm was\r\ncaused here by the sudden appearance of a visitor in British uniform,\r\nbut Barney soon explained the situation, and remained concealed until\r\nnight, when he was taken to the house of a clergyman. Here he found two\r\nAmericans, not prisoners, desirous of returning to America, and they\r\nagreed to buy a fishing boat and risk the crossing to France.\r\n\r\nSo the British uniform was exchanged for fisher garb, the boat\r\npurchased, and the three started. As his companions were soon prostrate\r\nfrom sea-sickness, Barney had to manage the craft himself; passed\r\nthrough the British war-ships safely, and seemed to be safe now from all\r\ninterference, when a schooner rapidly approached, showing British\r\ncolours, and presently lowered a boat which was pulled towards them.\r\n\r\nInstantly, Barney resolved to play a game of bluff. Luckily, in changing\r\nhis attire he had not left the British uniform behind. The boat came\r\nalongside and a privateer officer came aboard and asked Barney his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n‘Government business to France,’ replied Barney with dignity—and\r\ndisplayed the British uniform.\r\n\r\nThe officer was not satisfied, and said that he must report to his\r\ncaptain. This he did; the privateer captain was no more satisfied than\r\nhis lieutenant, and politely but firmly declared his intention of\r\ncarrying Barney back to Plymouth, adding that it must be funny business\r\nto take a British officer in uniform over to France in a fishing boat.\r\n\r\n‘Very well,’ said Barney, calm and dignified to the end; ‘then I hold\r\nyou responsible, for the interruption of my errand, to Admiral Digby, to\r\nwhose flag-ship I will trouble you to take me.’\r\n\r\nAll the same Barney saw that the game was up, and back towards Plymouth\r\nhe had to turn. Barney’s story is not very clear as to how he managed to\r\nescape the notice of the crew of the privateer, on board which he now\r\nwas, but he slipped into a boat alongside, cut her adrift, and made for\r\n‘Cawsen’. Landing here, and striking away inland, he thought it best to\r\nleave the high road, and so, climbing over a hedge, he found himself in\r\nEdgcumbe Park. Presently he came upon an old gardener at work. Barney\r\naccosted him, but all the reply he got was: ‘It’s a fine of half a\r\nguinea for crossing a hedge.’ Barney had no money, but plenty of\r\npleasant talk, the result of which was that the old man passed him out\r\nby a side gate and showed him a by-way towards the river. Barney, for\r\nobvious reasons, wished to avoid the public ferry, so crossed over in a\r\nbutcher’s boat, and passing under the very wall of Mill Prison, was soon\r\nin Plymouth and at the clergyman’s house.\r\n\r\nHe had had a narrow escape, for in less than an hour after Admiral Digby\r\nhad received the privateer captain’s report, a guard had been sent off\r\nfrom Mill Prison to Cawsand, and had he kept to the high road he would\r\nassuredly have been captured. Whilst at the clergyman’s house, the Town\r\nCrier passed under the window, proclaiming the reward of five guineas\r\nfor the apprehension of ‘Joshua Barney, a Rebel Deserter from Mill\r\nPrison’.\r\n\r\nBarney remained here three days. Then, with a fresh outfit, he took a\r\npost chaise for Exeter. At midnight the Town Gate was reached, and a\r\nsoldier closely examined Barney and compared him with his description on\r\nthe Apprehension bill. Again his _sang-froid_ came to the rescue, and he\r\nso contorted his face and eyes that he was allowed to proceed, and his\r\nescape was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 Barney was at Plymouth again; this time as a representative of\r\nthe Republic in a time of peace, and although an individual of\r\nimportance, entertaining all the great officials of the port on the\r\n_George Washington_, and being entertained by them in return, he found\r\ntime not only to visit the kindly clergyman who had befriended him, but\r\nto look up the old gardener at Mount Edgcumbe, amply pay the fine so\r\nlong due, and discover that the old man was the father of the sentry who\r\nhad enabled him to escape from Mill Prison!\r\n\r\nAn account by another American, Andrew Sherburne, published at Utica, in\r\n1825, of a sojourn in Mill Prison in 1781, is quoted only for his\r\nremarks on the hospital system, which do not accord with those of other\r\nwriters. He says:\r\n\r\n‘However inhuman and tyrannical the British Government was in other\r\nrespects, they were to be praised and respected for the suitable\r\nprovision they made for the sick in the hospitals at Mill Prison.’\r\n\r\nIn 1798 Vochez, the official sent to England by the French Directory to\r\ninquire into the true state of French prisoners under our care, brought\r\nan action against certain provision contractors for astounding breaches\r\nof their engagements, in the shape of a system of short weightage\r\ncarried on for years, and of supplying provisions of an inferior\r\ncharacter. In this he was supported by Captain Lane, a travelling\r\ninspector of prisons, and an honest official, and this, wrote Vochez,\r\n‘despite the contradiction by a number of base and interested prisoners\r\nbrought to London for that express purpose to attack the unblemished\r\ncharacter of that officer.’\r\n\r\nCaptain Lane insisted that the Governor of the Prison should give\r\ncertificates as to the badness of the provisions supplied; this was\r\ndone, and Vochez’s case was established. The Admiralty entirely endorsed\r\nCaptain Lane’s recommendation that in every case the Governors of\r\nPrisons should certify as to the character of provisions supplied by\r\ncontractors, highly complimented him on his action, and very heavily\r\nmulcted the rascally contractors. Unhappily, the vile system was far\r\nfrom being abolished. The interests of too many influential people were\r\nlinked with those of the contractors for a case such as the above to be\r\nmore than a flash in the pan, and the prison contractors continued to\r\nflourish until the very end of the Great War period.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 Mill Prison was practically rebuilt, and became known as\r\nMillbay. The condition of it at this time seems to have been very bad.\r\nIt was said that some of the poor inmates were so weak for lack of\r\nproper food that they fell from their hammocks and broke their necks,\r\nthat supplies of bedding and clothing were only to be had from\r\n‘capitalists’ among the prisoners, who had bought them from the\r\ndistribution officers and sold them at exorbitant rates.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, at the instance of some Spanish prisoners in Millbay, a firm of\r\nprovision contractors was heavily mulcted upon proof that for a long\r\ntime past they had systematically sent in stores of deficient quality.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 the Commissioners of the Transport Office refused an application\r\nthat French prisoners at Millbay should be allowed to manufacture\r\nworsted gloves for H.M.’s 87th Regiment, on the grounds that, if\r\nallowed, it would seriously interfere with our own manufacturing\r\nindustry, and further, would lead to the destruction by the prisoners of\r\ntheir blankets and other woollen articles in order to provide materials\r\nfor the work.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to give a very interesting account of prisoner life in\r\nMillbay Prison from Édouard Corbière’s book, _Le Négrier_.\r\n\r\nWhen a lad of fifteen, Corbière was captured on the _Val de Grâce_\r\nprivateer by H.M.S. _Gibraltar_, in 1807. The _Val de Grâce_ must have\r\nbeen a very small craft, for not only did she not show fight, but the\r\n_Gibraltar_ simply sent off a boat’s crew, made fast hawsers and\r\ntackles, and hoisted the Frenchman bodily on board. Corbière and his\r\nfellows were sent to Millbay. Before describing his particular\r\nexperiences, he gives a page or so to a scathing picture of our shore\r\nprisons, but he impressively accentuates the frightful depravity brought\r\nabout by the sufferings endured, and says that nobody who had not lived\r\nin an English war-prison could realize the utter depths of wickedness to\r\nwhich men could fall. At Millbay, he says, the _forts à bras_ ruled all\r\nby mere brute strength. Victories at fights or wrestling matches were\r\ncelebrated by procession round the airing grounds, and the successful\r\nmen formed the ‘Government’ of the _Pré_, as the airing ground was\r\ncalled, regulating the gambling, deciding disputes, officiating at\r\nduels—of which there were many, the weapons being razors or compass\r\npoints fixed on the ends of sticks—and generally exercising despotic\r\nsway. They were usually topsmen and sailors. The _Romains_ were the\r\npariahs at Millbay, and the _Rafalés_ the lowest of all, naked rascals\r\nwho slept in ranks, spoon fashion, as described elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe usual industries were carried on at Millbay. Much money was made by\r\nthe straw plaiters and workers, some of the latter earning 18 sous a\r\nday. But the straw ‘capitalists’, the men who bought straw wholesale\r\nthrough the soldiers of the guard, and who either employed workers\r\nthemselves, or sold the straw to other employers, accumulated fortunes,\r\nsays Corbière, of from 30,000 to 40,000 francs. There were teachers of\r\nsciences, languages, music, dancing and fencing. There were\r\neating-cabins where a ‘beef steak’ could be got for four sous. There\r\nwere theatrical performances, but not of the same character or quality\r\nas, for instance, at Portchester.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays, as at Stapleton, the prayers of the Mass were read. Each\r\nprovince was particular in observing its own festivals—Basques and\r\nBretons notably.\r\n\r\nA great many ‘broke-paroles’ were here, and, Corbière remarks, the\r\ncommon sailors took advantage of their fallen position and\r\nostentatiously treated them as equals, and even as inferiors. Not so the\r\nsoldiers, who punctiliously observed the distinctions of rank; and there\r\nwere even instances of private soldiers helping officers not used to\r\nmanual labour to supplement their daily rations.\r\n\r\nCorbière also emphasizes the fact that, notwithstanding the depth of\r\ndegradation to which the prisoners sank among themselves, they always\r\npreserved a proud attitude towards strangers, and never begged of\r\nvisitors and sight-seers.\r\n\r\nIn the prison, regular Courts of Justice were held, the chief _maître\r\nd’armes_ being generally elected President _if he could read_. The Court\r\nwas held within the space of twelve hammocks, shut in by hangings of old\r\ncloth. The only ordinary punishment was flogging, but a very terrible\r\nexception was made in the following case. One of the grandest and\r\nboldest projects for escape from a war-prison which had ever been\r\nconceived had been secretly proceeded with at Millbay for some time. It\r\nconsisted of a tunnel no less than 532 yards long (Corbière’s words are\r\n‘half a quarter league’, and the French league of this time measured 2\r\nmiles 743 yards) coming out in a field, by which the whole of the 5,000\r\nprisoners were to get away after overcoming and disarming the guard. The\r\nenormous quantity of earth excavated was carried by the workers in their\r\npockets and emptied into the latrines, and although I give the account\r\nas written, I cannot repress a doubt that Corbière, who was then but a\r\nboy, may have been mistaken in his figures, for this process alone of\r\nemptying a tunnel, big enough to allow the passage of a man, in\r\ncontinual fear of detection, must have been very long and laborious.\r\n\r\nAt any rate one Jean Caffé sold the secret to the authorities, the\r\nresult being that on the appointed night, when the tunnel was full of\r\nescaping prisoners, the first man to emerge at the outlet was greeted by\r\nScots soldiers, and the despairing cry arose, _Le trou est vendu_!\r\n\r\nDrums beat, the alarm brought more soldiers from Plymouth, and the\r\nwould-be escapers were put back into prison, but, so maddened were they\r\nat the failure at the eleventh hour of their cherished plot, that they\r\nrefused to put out the lights, sang songs of defiance, and broke out\r\ninto such a riot that the guard fired into them, with what result\r\nCorbière does not state.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, search was made for Caffé, who no doubt had been\r\nhidden by the authorities, and the miserable man was found with some\r\nguineas in his pocket. The rage of his countrymen was the deeper because\r\nCaffé had always been regarded as a poor, witless sort of fellow, for\r\nwhom everybody had pity, and who existed upon the charity of others, and\r\nthe cry arose that he should be at once put to death. But the chief of\r\nthe _Pré_, who happened to be Corbière’s captain on the _Val de Grâce_,\r\nand of whom more anon, said ‘Non! Il faut auparavant le flétrir!’\r\n\r\nSo Caffé was dragged before the entire assembly of prisoners. A\r\nprofessional tattooer then shaved his head, laid him on a table, and\r\nheld him down whilst on his forehead was pricked: ‘Flétri pour avoir\r\nVENDU 5000 de ses camarades dans la nuit du 4 Septembre 1807.’\r\n\r\nThis accomplished, he was taken to a well, thrown down it, and stones\r\nhurled on him until he was hidden from sight, and his cries could be\r\nheard no more. Corbière adds that, so far from the authorities trying to\r\nstop this summary execution, the British commander said that it served\r\nhim right, and that he would have done the same.\r\n\r\nIvan, the privateer captain who had been chief official at the foregoing\r\nexecution, had won his position as a _Chef de Pré_ in the following way.\r\nHe was dancing at a ball in Calais when the news was brought him that a\r\nrich British prize had been sighted, and without stopping to change his\r\ncostume, he had hurried on board the _Val de Grâce_, so that the prize\r\nshould not escape him. Hence, when captured by the _Gibraltar_, he was\r\nin full dancing kit,—laced coat, ruffles, silk stockings and all—and in\r\nthe same garb had been introduced into Millbay Prison, much to the\r\namusement of his fellow countrymen. Particularly did he attract the\r\nattention of the chief _fort à bras_, who had a good deal to say about\r\ncarpet knight and armchair sailor, which was so distasteful to Ivan that\r\nhe challenged him, fought him, and half-killed him. The result of which\r\nwas that the same night he was elected a _Chef de Pré_ with much pomp\r\nand circumstance. Furthermore, discovering among the prisoners old\r\ncomrades of the _Sans Façon_ privateer, they elected him head cook, a\r\nposition in the prison of no small consideration.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Milliken, purser of the prison, had a pretty wife who took such\r\na fancy to the handsome, dashing young French privateer captain that she\r\nmade him a present of a New Testament, although it was well she did not\r\nhear his description of it as ‘le beau fichu cadeau’. At the same time\r\nMilliken, socially superior, Corbière remarks, to his wife, pitying the\r\nboy (Corbière himself) thus thrust by fate at the very threshold of his\r\nlife into the wild, wicked world of a war-prison, offered him employment\r\nin his office, which he gladly accepted, going there every day, but\r\nreturning every night to the prison. Milliken’s office was on the ground\r\nfloor of his dwelling-house, and Mrs. Milliken with her servant Sarah\r\nwere constantly in and out, the result being that the boy became very\r\nfriendly with them, and their chief object seemed to be to make his life\r\nas happy as possible, the only cloud upon it being his separation every\r\nday from Ivan, for whom he had an affection bordering upon idolatry. For\r\nweeks Corbière had the happiest of lives, indulged in every way by Mrs.\r\nMilliken, and made much of by her visitors, to most of whom a lively,\r\nintelligent, French lad was a refreshing novelty. To dress him up in\r\nfeminine attire was a favourite amusement of the ladies, ‘and’, says\r\nCorbière, ‘they were good enough to say that, except for my rolling\r\ngait, begot of a lifetime spent afloat, I should pass well for a\r\ndistinguished-looking girl.’\r\n\r\nOne morning Mrs. Milliken gave him bad news. Ivan had escaped from the\r\nprison. He says: ‘Whatever feeling I had of gladness that my dear friend\r\nwas out of prison, was smothered not merely by the sense of my own\r\ndesolate position, but by surprise that he should have left me.’\r\n\r\nA day or two later a young woman appeared at the back door of the\r\nMillikens’ house, which gave on to the street, looked around cautiously\r\nfor a few moments, and then rapidly passed down the street. It was\r\nCorbière. It was a daring move, and it was not long before he wished he\r\nhad not made it, for Plymouth streets in these piping war-times were no\r\nplace for a respectable girl, and no doubt his flurried, anxious look,\r\nand palpable air of being a stranger, commanded unusual attention.\r\nWhither he was going he had no idea, and for an hour he went through\r\nwhat he confesses to have been one of the severest trials of a life full\r\nof adventure and ordeal. He was on the point of trying to find his way\r\nback to the Millikens’ house, when an old Jew man, with a bag over his\r\nshoulder, brushed against him, and at the same time whispered his name.\r\nIt was Ivan. The boy could have shouted for joy, but Ivan impressed\r\nsilence, and motioned him to follow. Arrived at Stonehouse, Ivan paused\r\nat a house, whispered to Corbière to walk on, return, and enter, and\r\nwent in himself. This was done, and Corbière describes how, when at last\r\ntogether in the house, they unrestrainedly indulged their joy at being\r\nagain together, and Ivan explained how both of their escapes had been\r\narranged by Mrs. Milliken. Then Ivan detailed his plan for getting out\r\nof England. He had thirty false one-pound notes, manufactured in Millbay\r\nPrison, which he had bought for a guinea, and the next day they would\r\nstart off on foot for Bigbury, about fifteen miles distant, on the\r\ncoast, near which they would charter a smuggler to take them across.\r\n\r\nThat evening they went into the town to make a few necessary purchases,\r\nand in his delight at being free again, Ivan proposed that they should\r\ngo to the theatre at Plymouth Dock. They did, and it nearly proved the\r\nundoing of them, for some American sailors were there who naturally\r\nregarded as fair game a nice-looking, attractively dressed girl in the\r\ncompany of a bearded old Jew, and paid Corbière attentions which became\r\nso marked as to provoke Ivan, the result being a row, in the course of\r\nwhich Ivan’s false beard was torn off, and Corbière’s dress much\r\nderanged, and the cry of ‘Runaway prisoners!’ beginning to be heard, the\r\ntwo rushed out of the theatre, and through the streets, until they were\r\nin the open country.\r\n\r\nThey spent the night, which luckily was warm and fine, in a ditch, and\r\nthe next morning saw an anchored boat riding close in shore. They swam\r\nout and boarded her, and found that there were rudder and oars chained,\r\nbut no sails or mast. Ivan broke the chain, and rigged up some of\r\nCorbière’s female clothes on an oar, for sail and mast. Some days ensued\r\nof much suffering from hunger and thirst, as, being without bearings,\r\nthey simply steered by the sun, south-east, and at last they were\r\nsighted and picked up by the _Gazelle_, French ‘aventurier’, of St.\r\nMalo, and in her went to Martinique.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 the Transport Office, in reply to French prisoners at Millbay\r\nasking leave to give fencing lessons outside the prison, refused, adding\r\nthat only officers of the guard were allowed to take fencing lessons\r\nfrom prisoners, and those in the prison.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 a dozen prisoners daubed themselves all over with mortar, and\r\nwalked out unchallenged as masons. Five were retaken. Another man\r\npainted his clothes like a British military uniform, and got away, as he\r\ndeserved to.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 additional buildings to hold 2,000 persons were erected at\r\nMillbay.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 a notable scene, indicative of the prevalence occasionally of a\r\nnice feeling between foes, was witnessed at Millbay, at the funeral of\r\nCaptain Allen of the United States ship _Argus_, who had died of wounds\r\nreceived in the action with the _Pelican_. Allen had been first\r\nlieutenant of the _United States_ in her victorious action with the\r\nBritish _Macedonian_, and had received his promotion for his bravery in\r\nthat encounter. Moreover, all the British prisoners taken by him\r\ntestified to his humanity and kindness. A contemporary newspaper says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Funeral Procession as it moved from the Mill Prison to the Old\r\nChurch, afforded a scene singularly impressive to the prisoners, who\r\nbeheld with admiration the respect paid by a gallant, conquering enemy\r\nto the fallen hero. 500 British Marines first marched in slow time, with\r\narms reversed; the band of the Plymouth Division of Marines followed,\r\nplaying the most solemn tunes. An officer of Marines in military\r\nmourning came after these. Two interesting black boys, the servants of\r\nthe deceased, then preceded the hearse. One of these bore his master’s\r\nsword, and the other his hat. Eight American officers followed the\r\nhearse, and the procession was closed with a number of British Naval\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n‘On the arrival of the body at the Old Church, it was met by the\r\nofficiating Minister, and three volleys over the grave closed the\r\nscene.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n                           THE PRISONS ASHORE\r\n                              10. DARTMOOR\r\n\r\nIn July 1805, the Transport Office, impressed by the serious crowding of\r\nwar-prisoners on the hulks at Plymouth and in the Millbay Prison,\r\nrequested their representative, Mr. Daniel Alexander, to meet the Hon.\r\nE. Bouverie, at the house of Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, warden of the\r\nStannaries, at Tor Royal, with the view of choosing a site for a great\r\nwar-prison to hold 5,000 men.\r\n\r\nMr. Baring-Gould more than hints that the particular spot chosen owed\r\nits distinction entirely to the personal interests of Sir Thomas. Says\r\nhe:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It is on the most inclement site that could have been selected,\r\ncatching the clouds from the South West, and condensing fog about it\r\nwhen everything else is clear. It is exposed equally to the North and\r\nEast winds. It stands over 1,400 feet above the sea, above the sources\r\nof the Meavy, in the highest as well as least suitable situation that\r\ncould have been selected; the site determined by Sir Thomas, so as to be\r\nnear his granite quarries.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1806, the first stone was laid; on May 24, 1809, the first\r\nprisoners came to it; in July the first two prisoners got out of it by\r\nbribing the sentries, men of the Notts Militia. The Frenchmen were\r\nrecaptured, one at a place called ‘The Jumps’, the other at Kingsbridge.\r\nThe soldiers, four in number, confessed they had received eight guineas\r\neach for their help, and two of them were condemned to be shot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nDARTMOOR WAR-PRISON, IN 1812.\r\n\r\nFROM A SKETCH SIGNED ‘JOHN WETHEMS’ IN THE PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE.\r\n(_Reproduced by kind permission of Mr. Basil Thomson and Col.

One half of the circle thus enclosed\r\nwas occupied by five huge barracks, each capable of holding more than\r\n1,000 men, with their airing grounds and shelters for bad weather, their\r\ninner ends converging on a large open space, where was held the market.\r\nEach barrack consisted of two floors, and above the top floor ran, the\r\nlength of the building, a roof room, designed for use when the weather\r\nwas too bad even for the outdoor shelters, but, as we shall see,\r\nappropriated for other purposes. On each floor, a treble tier of\r\nhammocks was slung upon cast-iron pillars. Each barrack had its own\r\nairing ground, supply of running water, and Black Hole. The other\r\nhalf-circle was occupied by two spacious blocks, one the hospital, the\r\nother the petty officers’ prison, by the officials’ quarters, the\r\nkitchen, washing-houses, and other domestic offices, and outside the\r\nmain, the Western Gate, the barrack for 400 soldiers and the officers’\r\nquarters. The cost of the prison was £135,000.\r\n\r\nBy the foreign prisoners of war Dartmoor was regarded, and not without\r\nreason, as the most hateful of all the British prisons. At Norman Cross,\r\nat Stapleton, at Perth, at Valleyfield, at Forton, at Millbay, they were\r\nat any rate within sight and hearing of the outer world. Escape from any\r\none of these places was, of course, made as difficult as possible, but\r\nwhen once an exit was effected, the rest was comparatively easy. But\r\nescape from Dartmoor meant very much more than the mere evading of\r\nsentries, the breaching and scaling of walls, or the patient labour of\r\nunderground burrowing. When all this was accomplished the fugitive found\r\nhimself not in a crowded city, where he could be lost to sight among the\r\nmultitude, nor in the open country where starvation was at any rate\r\nimpossible, nor by a water highway to freedom, nor, in short, in a world\r\nwherein he could exercise his five senses with at least a chance of\r\nsuccess; but in the wildest, most solitary, most shelterless, most\r\npathless, and, above all, most weather-tormented region of Britain. Any\r\none who has tried to take his bearings in a Dartmoor fog, or who has\r\nbeen caught by a Dartmoor snowstorm at the fall of day can realize this;\r\nthose who have not had one or other of these experiences, cannot do\r\nbetter than read _The American Prisoner_, by Mr. Eden Phillpotts.\r\n\r\nMore than this: at the other prisons a more or less sympathetic public\r\nwas near at hand which kept the prisoners in touch with the free life\r\nwithout, even if many of its members were merely curious gapers and\r\ngazers, or purchasers of manufactures. At Dartmoor the natives who came\r\nto the prison gates, came only to sell their produce. Being natives of a\r\nremote district, they were generally prejudiced against the prisoners,\r\nand Farmer Newcombe’s speech in Mr. Phillpotts’ _Farm of the Dagger_,\r\naccurately reproduces the sentiments prevalent among them:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Dartymoor’s bettern they deserve anyway. I should like to know what’s\r\ntoo bad for them as makes war on us. ’Tis only naked savages, I should\r\nhave thought, as would dare to fight against the most civilized and\r\nGod-fearing nation in the world.’\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, it is much to be feared that the jacks-in-office and petty\r\nofficials at Dartmoor, secure in their seclusion as they thought, were\r\nexacting and tyrannical to a degree not ventured upon in other places of\r\nconfinement more easily accessible to the light of inspection, and\r\nunsurrounded by a desert air into which the cries of anguish and\r\ndistress would rise in vain.\r\n\r\nAll the same, it was not long before the condition of prison life in\r\nDartmoor became known, even in high places.\r\n\r\nIn July 1811, the _Independent Whig_ published revelations of the state\r\nof Dartmoor which caused Lord Cochrane, member for Westminster, to bring\r\nthe facts before the notice of the House of Commons, but he expressed\r\nhis disappointment that his exposure had been without result, asserting\r\nthat the Government was afraid of losing what little character it had.\r\nHe declared that the soil of Dartmoor was one vast marsh, and was most\r\npestilential. Captivity, said he, was irksome enough without the\r\naddition of disease and torture. He asserted that the prison had been\r\nbuilt for the convenience of the town, and not the town for the\r\nconvenience of the prison, inasmuch as the town was a speculative\r\nproject which had failed. ‘Its inhabitants had no market, were solitary,\r\ninsulated, absorbed, and buried in their own fogs.’ To remedy this it\r\nwas necessary to do something, and so came about the building of the\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nThe article in the _Independent Whig_ which attracted Lord Cochrane’s\r\nattention was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘To foreigners, bred for the most part in a region the temperature of\r\nwhich is so comparatively pure to the air of our climate at the best of\r\ntimes, a transition so dreadful must necessarily have fatal\r\nconsequences, and indeed it is related that the prisoners commonly take\r\nto their beds at the first arrival, which nothing afterwards can induce\r\nthem to quit.... Can it bear reflection, much less inspection? Six or\r\nseven thousand human beings, deprived of liberty by the chance of war\r\n... consigned to linger out probably many tedious years in misery and\r\ndisease!\r\n\r\n‘While we declaim against the injustice and tyranny of our neighbours,\r\nshall we neglect the common duties of humanity? If we submit to crowd\r\nour dungeons with the virtuous and the just of our country, confounding\r\nmoral guilt with unintentional error, and subjecting them to\r\nindiscriminate punishment and the most inhuman privations, though we\r\nsubmit to this among ourselves, do not let us pursue the same system\r\ntowards individuals thrown on our compassion by the casualties of war,\r\nlest we provoke a general spirit of retaliation, and plunge again the\r\ncivilized world into the vortex of Barbarism. Let us not forget that the\r\nprisoner is a living trust in our hands, not to be subject to the\r\nwayward fancy of caprice, but a deposit placed at our disposal to be\r\nrequired at a future hour. It is a solemn charge, involving the care of\r\nlife and the principle of humanity.’\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Humanitas’ wrote in the _Examiner_, commenting upon Whitbread’s defence\r\nand laudation of Dartmoor as a residence, and amazed at the selection of\r\nsuch a place as the site for a prison:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The most inclement climate in England; for nine months there is no sun,\r\nand four and a half times as much rain as in Middlesex. The regiments on\r\nduty there have to be changed every two months. Were not the deaths\r\nduring the first three years 1,000 a year, and 3,000 sick? Did not from\r\n500 to 600 die in the winter of 1809? Is it not true that since some\r\ngentlemen visited the prison and published their terrible experiences,\r\nnobody has been allowed inside?’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer goes on, not so much to condemn the treatment of the\r\nprisoners as to blame the Government for spending so much money on such\r\na site.\r\n\r\nThe Transport Office took counsel’s opinion about prosecuting these two\r\nnewspapers for libel. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In my opinion both these papers are libellous. The first is the\r\nstrongest, but if the statement of deaths in the other is, as I conceive\r\nit is, wholly unsupported by the fact, this is equally mischievous. It\r\nis not, however, by any means clear to me that a jury will take the same\r\nview of the subject, ... but unless some serious consequences are to be\r\napprehended from suffering these publications to go unnoticed, I should\r\nnot be inclined to institute prosecutions upon them.\r\n\r\n                                                              V. GIBBS.’\r\n\r\n\r\nLater on, Vicary Gibbs thinks that they should be prosecuted, but wants\r\ninformation about the heavy mortality of November 1809 to April 1810,\r\nand also tables of comparison between the deaths in our own barracks and\r\nthose in French prisons.\r\n\r\nI cannot trace the sequel of this, but, reading by the light of the\r\ntimes, it is probable that the matter was hushed up in the same way as\r\nwere the exposures of Messrs. Batchelor and Andrews at Stapleton a few\r\nyears previously. The heavy mortality of the six months of 1809–10 was\r\ndue to an epidemic of measles, which carried off no less than 419\r\npersons in the four months of 1810 alone.\r\n\r\nViolent deaths among Dartmoor prisoners, whether from suicide or duel or\r\nmurder, were so frequent, even in the earliest years of the prison, that\r\nin 1810 the coroner of this division of the county complained, praying\r\nthat on account of the large numbers of inquests held—greater, he said,\r\nsince the opening of the prison than during the preceding fourteen\r\nyears—the ordinary allowance to jurors of 8_d._ per man be increased to\r\n1_s._ He emphasized the difficulty of collecting jurors, these being\r\nprincipally small farmers and artificers, who had in most cases to\r\ntravel long distances. The Parish of Lydford paid the fees, and the\r\ncoroner’s request was granted.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Story of Dartmoor Prison_ by Mr. Basil Thomson, I have, with\r\nthe kind permission of the author, taken many of the following facts,\r\nand with these I have associated some from the pen of the French writer,\r\nCatel.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the latter’s book we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘About six leagues to the North of Plymouth, under a dark and melancholy\r\nsky, in a cold and foggy atmosphere, a rocky, dry and almost naked soil,\r\ncovered eight months of the year with a mantle of snow, shuts in a space\r\nof some square leagues. This appearance strikes the view, and\r\ncommunicates a sort of bitterness to the soul. Nature, more than\r\nindifferent in complete stagnation, seems to have treated with\r\navaricious parsimony this corner of land, without doubt the ugliest in\r\nEngland. It is in this place, where no human thought dare hope for the\r\nsmallest betterment, that British philanthropy conceived and executed\r\nthe double project of building a prison in time of war for French\r\nprisoners, in time of Peace for her own criminals condemned to penal\r\nservitude. Comment is needless. The reader will appreciate the double\r\nhumanitarian thought which is apparent in its conception.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Thomson informs us that the present Infirmary was the old petty\r\nofficers’ prison. Here were confined officers who had broken their\r\nparole and who had been recaptured. Some of Rochambeau’s San Domingo\r\nofficers were here, and the building was known as the ‘Petit\r\nCautionnement’. As most of the officers here had private means, they\r\nformed a refined little society, dressed and lived well, and had\r\nservants to attend on them, taken from the ordinary prisoners, who were\r\npaid 3_d._ a day. Duels were frequent. In 1809, on the occasion of some\r\nnational or provincial festival, there was a procession with band and\r\nbanners. One Souville, a _maître d’armes_, felt himself slighted because\r\nhe had not been chosen to carry the national flag, and snatched it from\r\na youth of eighteen, to whom it had been entrusted. The youth attacked\r\nhim with his fists and gave him a thrashing, which so enraged the other,\r\nwhose _métier_ was that of arms, that he challenged him. The youth could\r\nnot fence, but as the weapons were sticks with razor-blades affixed,\r\nthis was not of serious moment. Souville, however, cut one of the\r\nyouth’s fingers off.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 two prisoners fought with improvised daggers with such ferocity\r\nthat both died before they could be carried to the hospital. In 1814,\r\ntwo fencing masters, hitherto great friends, quarrelled over the merits\r\nof their respective pupils, and fought with fists. The beaten man, Jean\r\nVignon, challenged the other to a more real trial by combat, and they\r\nfought in the ‘cock-loft’ of No. 4 Prison—where are now the kitchen and\r\nchapel. Vignon killed his opponent while the latter was stooping to pick\r\nup his foil, was brought up before the civil court, and condemned to six\r\nmonths for manslaughter.\r\n\r\nEvery day, except Sunday, a market was held from nine to twelve. Here,\r\nin exchange for money and produce, the prisoners sold the multifarious\r\narticles of their manufacture, excepting woollen mittens and gloves,\r\nstraw hats or bonnets, shoes, plaited straw, obscene toys and pictures,\r\nor articles made out of prison stores.\r\n\r\nThe chief punishment was relegation to the _cachot_ or Black Hole. At\r\nfirst this was a small building in the Infirmary Yard of such poor\r\nconstruction that it was frequent for the inmates to break out of it and\r\nmix with the other prisoners. But in 1811 the French prisoners built a\r\nnew one, twenty feet square, arch-roofed, and with a floor of granite\r\nblocks weighing a ton each.\r\n\r\nSome escapes from Dartmoor were notable, one, indeed, so much so that I\r\nhave given the hero of it, Louis Vanhille, a chapter to himself.\r\nSevegran, a naval surgeon, and Aunay, a naval officer, observing that\r\nfifty men were marched into the prison every evening to help the\r\nturnkeys to get the prisoners into their respective _casernes_, made\r\nunto themselves Glengarry caps and overcoats out of odds and ends of\r\ncloth and blanket and, with strips of tin to look like bayonets, calmly\r\nfell in at the rear of the guard as they left the prison, and, favoured\r\nby rain and darkness, followed out of the prison, and, as the troops\r\nmarched into barracks, got away. They had money, so from\r\nPlymouth—whither they tramped that night—they took coach to London. In\r\norder that they should have time to get well away, their accomplices in\r\nthe prison at the call-over the next morning got up a disturbance which\r\nput the turnkey out of his reckoning, and so they were not at once\r\nmissed.\r\n\r\nNext evening, three other prisoners, Keronel, Vasselin, and Cherabeau,\r\ntried the same trick. All went well. At the third gate, the keeper asked\r\nif the locking-up was finished, and as there was no reply he said: ‘All\r\nthese lobsters are deaf with their caps over their ears.’ The men\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nDr. Walker quotes an attempt of a similar character from Norman Cross:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A French prisoner made himself a complete uniform of the Hertfordshire\r\nMilitia, and a wooden gun, stained, surmounted by a tin bayonet. Thus\r\nequipped, he mixed with the guard, and when they were ordered to march\r\nout, having been relieved, Monsieur fell in and marched out too. Thus\r\nfar he was fortunate, but when arrived at the guard room, lo! what\r\nbefell him.\r\n\r\n‘His new comrades ranged their muskets on the rack, and he endeavoured\r\nto follow their example; but, as his wooden piece was unfortunately a\r\nfew inches too long, he was unable to place it properly. This was\r\nobserved, so of course his attempt to get away was frustrated.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bribing of sentries was a very necessary condition of escape. One or\r\ntwo pounds would generally do it, and it was through the sky-light of\r\nthe ‘cock-lofts’ that the prisoners usually got out of the locked-up\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nIn February 1811, four privates of the Notts Militia were heavily bribed\r\nfor the escape of two French officers. One of them, thinking he was\r\nunfairly treated in the division of the money, gave information, and a\r\npicket was in waiting for the escaping Frenchmen. The three men were\r\nsentenced to 900 lashes each. Two were pardoned, but one, who had given\r\nthe prisoners fire-arms, got 450.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1812, Edward Palmer, a ‘moorman,’ was fined £5 and got twelve\r\nmonths’ imprisonment for procuring a disguise for a French prisoner\r\nnamed Bellaird.\r\n\r\nEarly in the same year three prisoners escaped with the connivance of a\r\nRoscommon Militiaman. The sequel moves one’s pity. Pat was paid in\r\nbank-notes. He offered them for exchange, and, to his amazement, was\r\ninformed not only that he could receive nothing for them, but that he\r\nmust consider himself under arrest for uttering forged notes. It was too\r\ntrue. The three Frenchmen had paid him handsomely in notes fabricated by\r\none Lustique. The Irishman would not say where he got the notes, and it\r\nreally did not matter, for if he had admitted that he received them as\r\nthe price of allowing French prisoners to escape, he would have been\r\nflogged to death: as it was, he and Lustique were hanged.\r\n\r\nForgery was a prominent Dartmoor industry. Bank of England notes were\r\nforged to some extent, but local banks such as Grant, Burbey and Co. of\r\nPortsmouth, Harris, Langholme, and Harris of Plymouth, the Plymouth\r\nCommercial Bank, the Tamar Bank, the Launceston and Totnes Bank, were\r\nlargely victimized. To such an extent were these frauds carried out that\r\nit was ordered that an official should attend at the prison market to\r\nwrite his name on all notes offered by prisoners in payment for goods\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nIt was no doubt with reference to the local knowledge of soldiers on\r\nguard being valuable to intending escapes from the prison that the\r\nauthorities refused the application of the 1st Devon Militia to be on\r\nguard at Dartmoor, as there were ‘several strong objections to the men\r\nof that regiment being employed’.\r\n\r\nThere were distinct grades among the Dartmoor prisoners. First came ‘Les\r\nLords’—‘broke parole’ officers, and people with money. Next came ‘Les\r\nLaboureurs’, the clever, industrious men who not only lived comfortably\r\nby the sale of the articles they manufactured, but saved money so that\r\nsome of them left the prison at the Declaration of Peace financially\r\nvery much better off than when they came. These were the ‘respectable\r\nprisoners’. After the labourers came the ‘Indifférents’—loafers and\r\nidlers, but not mischief-makers or harm-workers; the ‘Misérables’,\r\nmischievous rascals for ever plotting and planning; and finally, the\r\nmost famous of all, the ‘Romans’, so called because they existed in the\r\ncock-loft, the ‘Capitole’, of one of the barracks. These men, almost\r\nentirely privateersmen, the scum and sweepings of sea-port towns, or\r\nland rascals with nothing to lose and all to gain in this world, formed\r\na veritable power in the prison. Gamblers to a man, they were mostly\r\nnaked, and held so faithfully to the theory of Communism, that when it\r\nwas necessary that someone should descend from the cock-loft eyrie in\r\norder to beg, borrow, or, what was more usual, to steal food or rags,\r\nthe one pair of breeches was lent to him for the occasion. The only\r\nhammock among them belonged to the ‘General’ or, to be more correct, was\r\nhis temporarily, for not even in Hayti were generals made and unmade\r\nwith such dispatch. The sleeping arrangement was that, mention of which\r\nhas already been made, known as the ‘spoon’ system, by which the naked\r\nmen lay so close together for warmth that the turn-over of the ranks had\r\nto be made at certain intervals by word of command. Catel tells an\r\nexcellent story of the ‘Romans’. These gentry held a parade on one of\r\nthe anniversaries, and were drawn up in order when a fine plump rat\r\nappeared on the airing ground—a new arrival, clearly, or he would have\r\nkept carefully away. This was too much for half-famished men; the ranks\r\nwere instantly broken and the chase began. As luck would have it, the\r\nrat ran into the garrison kitchens, where the day’s rations were being\r\nprepared, and in a very few minutes the pots and pans were cleared of\r\ntheir contents. Soldiers were at once hurried to the scene, but being\r\nfew in number they were actually overpowered and disarmed by the\r\n‘Romans’, who marched them to the Governor’s house. Here the ‘General’,\r\nwith a profound salute, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Sir, we have come here to deliver over to you our prisoners and their\r\narms. It is a happy little occurrence this, as regards your soldiers,\r\nquiet now as sheep. We beg, you, therefore, to grant them as reward\r\ndouble rations, and to make up the loss we have caused in the provisions\r\nof our honoured visitors.’\r\n\r\n\r\nCatel adds that the rat was caught and eaten raw!\r\n\r\nGradually, their violence and their thieving propensities made them a\r\nterror to the other prisoners; the Americans, in particular, objected to\r\ntheir filthy habits, and at length their conduct became so intolerable\r\nthat they were marched off to the Plymouth hulks, on which they were\r\nkept until the Peace of 1814.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that when an epidemic swept the prisons and\r\ncarried off the decent and cleanly by hundreds, the impregnable\r\ndirt-armour of the ‘Romans’ kept them unscathed. This epidemic was the\r\nterrible visitation of malignant measles which from November 1809 to\r\nApril 1810 inclusive, claimed about 400 victims out of 5,000 prisoners.\r\nThe burial-ground was in the present gas-house field; the mortuary,\r\nwhere the bodies were collected for burial, was near the present General\r\nHospital. No funeral rites were observed, and not more than a foot of\r\nearth heaped over the bodies.\r\n\r\nCatel also relates a very clever and humorous escape. Theatricals were\r\nlargely patronized at Dartmoor, as in the other prisons. A piece\r\nentitled _Le Capitaine Calonne et sa dame_ was written in eulogy of a\r\ncertain British garrison officer and his lady, and, being shown to them\r\nin manuscript, so flattered and delighted them, that, in order that the\r\npiece should not lack local colour at the opening performance, the\r\nCaptain offered to lend a British suit of regimentals, and his lady to\r\nprovide a complete toilette, for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThese, of course, were gladly accepted. The theatre was crowded, and the\r\nnew piece was most successful, until the opening of the third act, when\r\nthe manager stepped forward, and, amidst whistles and catcalls, said:\r\n‘Messieurs, the play is finished. The English Captain and his lady are\r\nout of the prison.’ This was true. During the second act the\r\nprisoner-Captain and his lady quietly passed out of the prison, being\r\nsaluted by guards and sentries, and got away to Tavistock. Catel relates\r\nwith gusto the adventure of the real captain and his wife with the said\r\nguards and sentinels, who swore that they had left the prison some time\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe delight of the prisoners can be pictured, and especially when it was\r\nrumoured two days later that the real Captain received his uniform, and\r\nhis lady her dress, in a box with a polite letter of thanks from the\r\nescaped prisoners.\r\n\r\nAn escape of a similar character to the foregoing was effected from one\r\nof the Portsmouth hulks. On one occasion a prisoner acted the part of a\r\nfemale so naturally, that an English naval Captain was deceived\r\ncompletely. He proposed to the supposed girl to elope. The pseudo-maiden\r\nwas nothing loth, and (said the late Rev. G. N. Godwin in a lecture from\r\nwhich I take this) there is an amusing sketch showing the Captain in\r\nfull uniform passing the gangway with the lady on his arm, the sentry\r\npresenting arms meanwhile. Of course, when the gallant officer\r\ndiscovered his mistake, there was nothing for it but to assist in the\r\nescape of the astute prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, Hageman, the bread contractor, was brought up for fraudulent\r\ndealing, and was mulcted in £3,000, others concerned in the transactions\r\nbeing imprisoned for long terms.\r\n\r\nI am glad to be able to ring a change in the somewhat monotonous tone of\r\nthe prisoners’ complaints, inasmuch as American prisoners have placed on\r\nrecord their experiences: one of them, Andrews, in a very comprehensive\r\nand detailed form.\r\n\r\nFrom the autumn of 1812 to April of 1813, there were 900 American\r\nprisoners at Chatham, 100 at Portsmouth, 700 at Plymouth, ‘most of them\r\ndestitute of clothes and swarming with vermin.’ On April 2, 1813, the\r\nTransport Board ordered them all to Dartmoor, no doubt because of their\r\nceaseless attempts to escape from the hulks. They were horrified, for\r\nthey knew it to have the reputation of being the worst prison in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nFrom the Plymouth hulks _Hector_ and _Le Brave_, 250 were landed at New\r\nPassage, and marched the seventeen miles to Dartmoor, where were already\r\n5,000 French prisoners. On May 1, 1813, Cotgrave, the Governor, ordered\r\nall the American prisoners to be transferred to No. 4 _caserne_, where\r\nwere already 900 French ‘Romans’.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DARTMOOR. THE ORIGINAL MAIN ENTRANCE.\r\n\r\n  (_From a sketch by the Author._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe garrison at Dartmoor consisted of from 1,200 to 1,500 men, who, says\r\nAndrews, without the smallest foundation of fact, had been told off for\r\nthis duty as punishment for offences. The truth is, that as our small\r\nregular army was on duty in many places elsewhere, the Militia had to be\r\ndrawn upon for the garrisoning of war-prisons, and that on account of\r\nthe many ‘pickings’ to be had, war-prison duty was rather sought than\r\nshunned. The garrison was frequently changed at all the war-prisons for\r\nno other reason than that between guards and guarded an undesirable\r\nintimacy usually developed.\r\n\r\nThe American prisoners, who, throughout the war, were generally of a\r\nsuperior type to the Frenchmen, very much resented this association of\r\nthem with the low-class ruffians in No. 4. I may here quote Mr. Eden\r\nPhillpotts’s remarks in his _Farm of the Dagger_.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘There is not much doubt that these earlier prisoners of war suffered\r\nvery terribly. Their guards feared them more than the French. From the\r\nhulks came warnings of their skill and ingenuity, their courage, and\r\ntheir frantic endeavours to regain liberty. The American Agent for\r\nPrisoners of War at Plymouth, one Reuben Beasley, was either a knave or\r\na fool, and never have unhappy sufferers in this sort endured more from\r\na callous, cruel, or utterly inefficient and imbecile representative.\r\nWith sleepless rigour and severity were the Americans treated in that\r\nstern time; certain advantages and privileges permitted to the French at\r\nPrincetown were at first denied them, and to all their petitions,\r\nreasonable complaints, and remonstrances, the egregious Beasley turned a\r\ndeaf ear, while the very medical officer at the gaol at that season\r\nlacked both knowledge of medicine and humanity, and justified his\r\nconduct with falsehood before he was removed from office.’\r\n\r\n\r\nTheirs was indeed a hard lot. This last-mentioned brute, Dyer, took note\r\nof no sickness until it was too far gone to be treated, and refused\r\npatients admission to the hospital until the last moment: for fear, he\r\nsaid, of spreading the disease. They were, as Mr. Phillpotts says,\r\ndenied many privileges and advantages allowed to Frenchmen of the lowest\r\nclass; they were shut out from the usual markets, and had to buy through\r\nthe French prisoners, at 25 per cent. above market prices.\r\n\r\nOn May 18, 1813, 250 more Americans came from the _Hector_ hulk, and on\r\nJuly 1, 100 more.\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1813, was a dark day in the history of the prison. The\r\nAmericans, with the idea of getting up an Independence Day celebration,\r\ngot two flags and asked permission to hold a quiet festival. Captain\r\nCotgrave, the Governor, refused, and sent the guard to confiscate the\r\nflags. Resistance was offered; there was a struggle and one of the flags\r\nwas captured. In the evening the disturbance was renewed, an attempt was\r\nmade to recapture the flag, the guard fired upon the prisoners and\r\nwounded two. The feeling thus fostered burst out into a flame on July\r\n10, when the ‘Romans’ in the two upper stories of No. 4 Prison collected\r\nweapons of all sorts, and attacked the Americans unexpectedly, with the\r\navowed purpose of killing them all. A terrible encounter was the result,\r\nin the midst of which the guards charged in and separated the two\r\nparties, but not until forty on both sides had been badly wounded. After\r\nthis a wall fifteen feet high was built to divide the airing ground of\r\nNo. 4.\r\n\r\nAndrews describes the clothing of the prisoners as consisting of a cap\r\nof wool, one inch thick and coarser than rope yarn, a yellow jacket—not\r\nlarge enough to meet round the smallest man, although most of the\r\nprisoners were reduced by low living to skeletons—with the sleeves\r\nhalf-way up the arms, a short waistcoat, pants tight to the middle of\r\nthe shin, shoes of list with wooden soles one and a half inches thick.\r\n\r\nAn epidemic of small-pox broke out; complaints poured in to Beasley\r\nabout the slack attention paid to it, about the overcrowding, the\r\nconsequent vermin, and the frauds of the food contractors, but without\r\nresults. Then came remonstrances about the partiality shown in giving\r\nall lucrative offices to French prisoners, that is to say, positions\r\nsuch as one sweeper to every 100 men at threepence a day, one cook to\r\nevery 200 at fourpence halfpenny; barber at threepence; nurses in the\r\nhospital at sixpence—all without avail. As a rule the Americans were\r\nglad to sell their ration of bad beef to Frenchmen, who could juggle it\r\ninto fancy dishes, and with the money they bought soap and\r\nchewing-tobacco.\r\n\r\nAt length Beasley came to see for himself, but although he expressed\r\nsurprise at the crowding of so many prisoners, and said he was glad he\r\nhad not to be in Dartmoor, he could promise no redress.\r\n\r\nAndrews alludes to the proficiency of the French prisoners in the\r\nscience of forging not only bank-notes, but shillings out of Spanish\r\ndollars which they collected from the outside of the market, making\r\neight full-weight shillings out of every four dollars. The performers\r\nwere chiefly officers who had broken parole. The ordinary run of\r\nDartmoor prisoners, he says, somewhat surprisingly, so far from being\r\nthe miserable suffering wretches we are accustomed to picture them, were\r\nlight-hearted, singing, dancing, drinking men who in many cases were\r\nsaving money.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WOODEN WORKING MODEL OF A FRENCH TRIAL SCENE\r\n\r\n  Made by prisoners of war at Dartmoor\r\n]\r\n\r\nIsaac Cotgrave he describes as a brutal Governor, who seemed to enjoy\r\nmaking the lot of the prisoners in his charge as hard as possible, and\r\nhe emphasizes the cruelty of the morning out-of-door roll-call parade in\r\nthe depth of winter; but he speaks highly of the kindness and\r\nconsideration of the guards of a Scottish Militia regiment which took\r\nover the duty.\r\n\r\nHitherto the negroes, who formed no inconsiderable part of American\r\ncrews, were mixed with the white men in the prisons. A petition from the\r\nAmerican white prisoners that the blacks should be confined by\r\nthemselves, as they were dirty by habit and thieves by nature, was\r\nacceded to.\r\n\r\nGradually the official dread of American determination to obtain liberty\r\nwas modified, and a general freedom of intercourse was instituted which\r\nhad not been enjoyed before. A coffee-house was established, trades\r\nsprang up, markets for tobacco, potatoes, and butter were carried on,\r\nthe old French monopoly of trade was broken down, and the American\r\nprisoners imitated their French companions in manufacturing all sorts of\r\nobjects of use and ornament for sale. The French prisoners by this time\r\nwere quite well off, the different professors of sciences and arts\r\nhaving plenty of pupils, straw-plaiting for hats bringing in threepence\r\na day, although it was a forbidden trade, and plenty of money being\r\nfound for theatrical performances and amusements generally.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Americans, too, kept pace, for Beasley presently\r\nannounced further money allowances, so that each prisoner now received\r\n6_s._ 8_d._ per month, the result being a general improvement in outward\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nOn May 20, 1814, peace with France was announced amidst the frenzied\r\nrejoicings of the French prisoners. All Frenchmen had to produce their\r\nbedding before being allowed to go. One poor fellow failed to comply,\r\nand was so frantic at being turned back, that he cut his throat at the\r\nprison gate. 500 men were released, and with them some French-speaking\r\nAmerican officers got away, and when this was followed by a rumour that\r\nall the Americans were to be removed to Stapleton, where there was a\r\nbetter market for manufactures, and which was far healthier than\r\nDartmoor, the tone of the prison was quite lively and hopeful. This\r\nrumour, however, proved to be unfounded, but it was announced that\r\nhenceforth the prisoners would be occupied in work outside the prison\r\nwalls, such as the building of the new church, repairing roads, and in\r\ncertain trades.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, 1814, two _Argus_ men fought. One killed the other and was\r\ncommitted to Exeter for manslaughter.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, Independence Day celebrations were allowed, and money being\r\ncomparatively abundant, a most successful banquet on soup and beef was\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, a prisoner, James Hart, died, and over his burial-place the\r\nfollowing epitaph was raised:\r\n\r\n                ‘Your country mourns your hapless fate,\r\n                So mourn we prisoners all;\r\n                You’ve paid the debt we all must pay,\r\n                Each sailor great and small.\r\n                Your body on this barren moor,\r\n                Your soul in Heaven doth rest;\r\n                Where Yankee sailors one and all,\r\n                Hereafter will be blest.’\r\n\r\nThe prison was much crowded in this year, 1814; in No. 4 barrack alone\r\nthere were 1,500 prisoners, and yet the new doctor, Magrath, who is\r\ndescribed by Andrews as being both skilful and humane, gave very strong\r\ntestimony to its healthiness.\r\n\r\nIn reply to a general petition from the prisoners for examination into\r\ntheir grievances, a Commission was sent to Dartmoor in 1813, and the\r\nnext year reported that the only complaints partially justifiable were\r\nthat of overcrowding, which was largely due to the preference of the\r\nprisoners for the new buildings with wooden floors, which were finished\r\nin the summer of 1812; and that of the ‘Partial Exchange’, which meant\r\nthat whereas French privateers when they captured a British ship, landed\r\nor put the crew in a neutral ship and kept the officers, British captors\r\nkept all.\r\n\r\nTwo desperate and elaborate attempts at escape by tunnelling were made\r\nby American prisoners in 1814. Digging was done in three barracks\r\nsimultaneously—from No. 4, in which there were 1,200 men, from No. 5,\r\nwhich was empty, and from No. 6, lately opened and now holding 800\r\nmen—down in each case twenty feet, and then 250 feet of tunnel in an\r\neasterly direction towards the road outside the boundary wall. On\r\nSeptember 2 Captain Shortland, the new Agent, discovered it; some say it\r\nwas betrayed to him, but the prisoners themselves attributed it to\r\nindiscreet talking. The enormous amount of soil taken out was either\r\nthrown into the stream running through the prison, or was used for\r\nplastering walls which were under repair, coating it with whitewash.\r\n\r\nWhen the excitement attendant on this discovery had subsided, the\r\nindefatigable Americans got to work again. The discovered shafts having\r\nbeen partially blocked by the authorities with large stones, the\r\nplotters started another tunnel from the vacant No. 5 prison, to connect\r\nwith the old one beyond the point of stoppage. Mr. Basil Thomson has\r\nkindly allowed me to publish an interesting discovery relative to this,\r\nmade in December, 1911:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘While excavating for the foundations of the new hall at Dartmoor, which\r\nis being built on the site of IV. A and B Prison, the excavators broke\r\ninto what proved to be one of the subterranean passages which were\r\nsecretly dug by the American prisoners in 1814 with a view to escape.\r\nNumber IV Prison, then known as Number V, was at that time empty, and,\r\nas Charles Andrews tells us, the plan was to tunnel under the boundary\r\nwalls and then, armed with daggers forged at the blacksmith’s shop, to\r\nemerge on a stormy night and make for Torbay, where there were believed\r\nto be fishing boats sufficient to take them to the French coast. No one\r\nwas to be taken alive. The scheme was betrayed by a prisoner named\r\nBagley (of Portsmouth, New Hampshire), who, to save him from the fury of\r\nthe prisoners, was liberated and sent home.... One of these tunnels was\r\ndisclosed when the foundation of IV. C Hall were dug in 1881. The tunnel\r\nfound last month may have been the excavation made after the first shaft\r\nhad been filled up. It was 14 feet below the floor of the prison, 3 feet\r\nin height, and 4 feet wide. More than one person explored it on hands\r\nand knees as far as it went, which was about 20 feet in the direction of\r\nthe boundary wall. A marlin spike and a ship’s scraper of ancient\r\npattern were found among the débris, and are now in the Prison Museum.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time (Sept. 1814) there were 3,500 American prisoners at\r\nDartmoor, and so constant were they in their petty annoyance, almost\r\npersecution, of their guardians; so independent were they of rules and\r\nregulations; so constant with their petitions, remonstrances, and\r\ncomplaints; so untiring in their efforts to escape; so averse to\r\nanything like settling down and making the best of things, as did the\r\nFrench, that the authorities declared they would rather be in charge of\r\n20,000 Frenchmen than of 2,000 Americans.\r\n\r\nAfter the above-related attempts to escape, the prisoners were confined\r\nto Nos. 2 and 3 barracks, and put on two-thirds ration allowance to pay\r\nfor damage done.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1814, eight escaped by bribing the sentries to procure them\r\nmilitary coats and caps, and so getting off at night. Much amusement,\r\ntoo, was caused one evening by the jangling of the alarm bells, the\r\nhurrying of soldiers to quarters, and subsequent firing at a ‘prisoner’\r\nescaping over the inner wall—the ‘prisoner’ being a dummy dressed up.\r\n\r\nIn November, 5,000 more prisoners came into the prison. There was much\r\nsuffering this winter from the cold and scanty clothing. A petition to\r\nhave fires in the barracks was refused. A man named John Taylor, a\r\nnative citizen of New York City, hanged himself in No. 5 prison on the\r\nevening of December 1.\r\n\r\nPeace, which had been signed at Ghent on December 24, 1814, was declared\r\nat Dartmoor, and occasioned general jubilation. Flags with ‘Free Trade\r\nand Sailors’ Rights’ thereon paraded with music and cheering, and\r\nShortland politely requested that they should be withdrawn, but met with\r\na flat refusal. Unfortunately much of unhappy moment was to happen\r\nbetween the date of the ratification of the Treaty of Ghent in March,\r\n1815, and the final departure of the prisoners. Beasley was\r\nunaccountably negligent and tardy in his arrangements for the reception\r\nand disposal of the prisoners, so that although _de jure_ they were free\r\nmen, _de facto_ they were still detained and treated as prisoners.\r\nSmall-pox broke out, and it was only by the unwearying devotion and\r\nactivity of Dr. Magrath, the prison surgeon, that the epidemic was\r\nchecked, and that the prisoners were dissuaded from going further than\r\ngiving Beasley a mock trial and burning him in effigy.\r\n\r\nOn April 20, 1815, 263 ragged and shoeless Americans quitted Dartmoor,\r\nleaving 5,193 behind. The remainder followed in a few days, marching to\r\nPlymouth, carrying a huge white flag on which was represented the\r\ngoddess of Liberty, sorrowing over the tomb of the killed Americans,\r\nwith the legend: ‘Columbia weeps and will remember!’ Before the\r\nprisoners left, they testified their gratitude to Dr. Magrath for his\r\nunvarying kindness to them, by an address.\r\n\r\n‘Greenhorn,’ another American, gives little details about prison life at\r\nDartmoor, which are interesting as supplementary to the fuller book of\r\nAndrews.\r\n\r\n‘Greenhorn’ landed at Plymouth on January 30, 1815, after the Treaty of\r\nGhent had been signed, but before its ratification, and was marched via\r\nMannamead, Yelverton, and the Dursland Inn to Dartmoor.\r\n\r\nHe describes the inmates of the American ‘Rough Alleys’ as corresponding\r\nin a minor degree to the French ‘Romans’, the principal source of their\r\npoverty being a gambling game known as ‘Keno’.\r\n\r\nHe says—and it may be noted—that he found the food at Dartmoor good, and\r\nmore abundant than on board ship. The American prisoners kept Sunday\r\nstrictly, all buying, selling, and gambling was suspended by public\r\nopinion, and every man dressed in his cleanest and best, and spent the\r\nday quietly. He speaks of the great popularity of Dr. Magrath, although\r\nhe made vaccination compulsory. Ship-model making was a chief industry.\r\nThe Americans settled their differences in Anglo-Saxon fashion, the\r\nchief fighting-ground being in Bath Alley. Announcements of these and of\r\nall public meetings and entertainments were made by a well-known\r\ncharacter, ‘Old Davis,’ in improvised rhyme. Another character was the\r\npedlar Frank Dolphin.\r\n\r\nIn dress, it was the aim of every one to disguise the hideous\r\nprison-garb as much as possible, the results often being ludicrous in\r\nthe extreme.\r\n\r\nEverybody was more or less busy. There were schoolmasters and music\r\nteachers, a band, a boxing academy, a dancing school, a glee-club, and a\r\ntheatre. There were straw-basket making, imitation Chinese wood-carving,\r\nand much false coining, the lead of No. 6 roof coming in very handy for\r\nthis trade. Washermen charged a halfpenny a piece, or one penny\r\nincluding soap and starch.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 was the bad prison—the Ball Alley of the roughs. Each prison,\r\nexcept No. 4, was managed by a committee of twelve, elected by the\r\ninmates. From their decisions there was no appeal. Gambling was\r\nuniversal, ranging from the penny ‘sweet-cloth’ to _Vingt-et-un_. Some\r\nof the play was high, and money was abundant, as many of the\r\nprivateersmen had their prize-money. One man possessed £1,100 on Monday,\r\nand on Thursday he could not buy a cup of coffee. The rule which\r\nprecluded from the privilege of parole all but the masters and first\r\nmates of privateers of fourteen guns and upwards brought a number of\r\nwell-to-do men into the prison, and, moreover, the American Government\r\nallowance of 2½_d._ a day for soap, coffee, and tobacco, circulated\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe following notes from the _Journal of a Young Man of Massachusetts_,\r\nBenjamin Waterhouse by name, whom we have already met on the Chatham\r\nhulks, are included, as they add a few details of life at Dartmoor to\r\nthose already given.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I shall only say that I found it, take it all in all, a less\r\ndisagreeable prison than the ships; the life of a prudent, industrious,\r\nwell-behaved man might here be rendered pretty easy, for a prison life,\r\nas was the case with some of our own countrymen and some Frenchmen; but\r\nthe young, the idle, the giddy, fun-making youth generally reaped such\r\nfruit as he sowed. Gambling was the wide inlet to vice and disorder, and\r\nin this Frenchmen took the lead. These men would play away everything\r\nthey possessed beyond the clothes to keep them decent. They have been\r\nknown to game away a month’s provision, and when they had lost it, would\r\nshirk and steal for a month after for their subsistence. A man with some\r\nmoney in his pocket might live pretty well through the day in Dartmoor\r\nPrison, there being shops and stalls where every little article could be\r\nobtained; but added to this we had a good and constant market, and the\r\nbread and meat supplied by Government were not bad; and as good I\r\npresume as that given to British prisoners by our own Government.’\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BONE MODEL OF GUILLOTINE\r\n\r\n  Made by prisoners of war at Dartmoor\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe speaks very highly of the tall, thin, one-eyed Dr. Magrath, the\r\nprison doctor, but of his Scots assistant, McFarlane, as a rough,\r\ninhuman brute. Shortland, the governor, he describes as one who\r\napparently revelled in the misery and discomfort of the prisoners under\r\nhis charge, although in another place he defines him as a man, not so\r\nmuch bad-hearted, as an ill-educated, tactless boor.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse describes the peculiarly harsh proceeding of Shortland after\r\nthe discovery of the tunnel dug from under No. 6 caserne. All the\r\nprisoners with their baggage were driven into the yard of No. 1: thence\r\nin a few days to another yard, and so on from yard to yard, so that they\r\ncould not get time to dig tunnels; at the same time they were subjected\r\nto all kinds of petty bullyings, such as being kept waiting upon\r\nnumbering days in the open, in inclement weather, until Shortland should\r\nchoose to put in an appearance. On one of these occasions the Americans\r\nrefused to wait, and went back to their prisons, for which offence the\r\nmarket was stopped for two days.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1814 there were at Dartmoor 2,350 Americans. There seemed\r\nto be much prosperity in the prison: the market was crowded with food,\r\nand hats and boots and clothes; Jew traders did a roaring trade in\r\nwatches, seals, trinkets, and bad books; sharp women also were about,\r\nselling well-watered milk at 4_d._ a gallon; the ‘Rough Alleys’ were in\r\ngreat strength, and kept matters lively all over the prison.\r\n\r\nNumber 4 caserne was inhabited by black prisoners, whose ruler was ‘King\r\nDick,’ a giant six feet five inches in height, who, with a huge bearskin\r\nhat on head, and a thick club in hand, exercised regal sway, dispensing\r\njustice, and, strange to say, paying strict attention to the cleanliness\r\nof his subjects’ berths. Nor was religion neglected in No. 4, for every\r\nSunday ‘Priest Simon’ preached, assisted by ‘Deacon John’, who had been\r\na servant in the Duke of Kent’s household, and who at first urged that\r\nDivine Service should be modelled on that customary on British\r\nmen-of-war and in distinguished English families, but was overruled by\r\nthe decision of a Methodist preacher from outside. ‘King Dick’ always\r\nattended service in full state. He also kept a boxing school, and in No.\r\n4 were also professors of dancing and music and fencing, who had many\r\nwhite pupils, besides theatricals twice a week, performed with ludicrous\r\nsolemnity by the black men, whose penchant was for serious and tragical\r\ndramas. Other dramatic performances were given by an Irish Regular\r\nregiment from Spain, which relieved the Derby Militia garrison, in the\r\ncock-loft of No. 6 caserne, the admission thereto being 6_d._\r\n\r\nStill, there was much hunger, and when it was rumoured that Jew\r\nclothes-merchants in the market were dealing with undue sharpness with\r\nunfortunate venders, a raid was made by the Americans upon their stalls\r\nand booths which wrought their destruction.\r\n\r\nBeasley was still a _bête noire_. His studied neglect of the interests\r\nof those whose interests were in his charge, his failure to acquaint\r\nhimself by personal attention with their complaints, made him hated far\r\nmore than were the British officials, excepting Shortland. One day he\r\nwas tried in effigy, and sentenced to be hung and burnt. A pole was\r\nrigged from the roof of No. 7 caserne, Beasley’s effigy was hung\r\ntherefrom, was cut down by a negro, taken away by the ‘Rough Alleys’,\r\nand burnt. On the same day, ‘Be you also ready’ was found painted on the\r\nwall of Shortland’s house. He said to a friend:\r\n\r\n‘I never saw or ever read or heard of such a set of Devil-daring,\r\nGod-provoking fellows, as these same Yankees. I had rather have the\r\ncharge of 5,000 Frenchmen, than 500 of these sons of liberty; and yet I\r\nlove the dogs better than I do the d——d frog-eaters.’\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1815, came the Ratification of Peace, but, although this\r\nmade the Americans virtually free men, much of a lamentable nature was\r\nto happen ere they practically became so.\r\n\r\nAs is so often the case in tragedy, a comparatively trifling incident\r\nbrought it about.\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 1815, the provision contractors thought to get rid of their\r\nstock of hard bread (biscuit) which they held in reserve by serving it\r\nout to the prisoners instead of the fresh bread which was their due. The\r\nAmericans refused to have it, swarmed round the bakeries on mischief\r\nintent, and refused to disperse when ordered to. Shortland was away in\r\nPlymouth at the time, and the officer in charge, seeing that it was\r\nuseless to attempt to force them with only 300 Militia at his command,\r\nyielded, and the prisoners got their bread. When Shortland returned, he\r\nwas very angry at what he deemed the pusillanimous action of his\r\nsubordinate, swore that if he had been there the Yankees should have\r\nbeen brought to order at the point of the bayonet, and determined to\r\ncreate an opportunity for revenge.\r\n\r\nThis came on April 6. According to the sworn testimony of witnesses at\r\nthe subsequent inquiry, some boys playing at ball in the yard of No. 7\r\ncaserne, knocked a ball over into the neighbouring barrack yard, and,\r\nupon the sentry on duty there refusing to throw it back, made a hole in\r\nthe wall, crept through it, and got the ball. Shortland pretended to see\r\nin this hole-making a project to escape, and made his arrangements to\r\nattract all the prisoners out of their quarters by ringing the alarm\r\nbell, and, in order to prevent their escape back into them, had ordered\r\nthat one of the two doors in each caserne should be closed, although it\r\nwas fifteen minutes before the regulation lock-up time at 6 o’clock. It\r\nwas sworn that he had said: ‘I’ll fire the d——d rascals presently.’\r\n\r\nAt 6 p.m. the alarm bell brought the prisoners out of all the\r\ncasernes—wherein they were quietly settled—to see what was the cause. In\r\nthe market square were ‘several hundred’ soldiers, with Shortland at\r\ntheir head, and at the same time many soldiers were being posted in the\r\ninner wall commanding the prison yards. One of these, according to a\r\nwitness, called out to the crowd of prisoners to go indoors as they\r\nwould be charged on very soon. This occasioned confusion and alarm and\r\nsome running about. What immediately followed is not very clear, but it\r\nwas sworn that Shortland ordered the soldiers to charge the prisoners\r\nhuddled in the market square; that the soldiers—men of the Somerset\r\nMilitia—hesitated; that the order was repeated, and the soldiers charged\r\nthe prisoners, who retreated into the prison gates; that Shortland\r\nordered the gates to be opened, and that the consequent confusion among\r\nhundreds of men vainly trying to get into the casernes by the one door\r\nof each left open, and being pushed back by others coming out to see\r\nwhat was the matter, was wilfully magnified by Shortland into a\r\nconcerted attempt to break out, and he gave the word to fire.\r\n\r\nIt was said that, seeing a hesitation among his officers to repeat the\r\ncommand, Shortland himself seized a musket from a soldier and fired the\r\nfirst shot. Be that as it may, the firing became general from the walls\r\nas well as from the square; soldiers came to the doors of two of the\r\ncasernes and fired through them, with the result, according to American\r\naccounts, that seven men were killed, thirty were dangerously wounded,\r\nand thirty slightly wounded; but according to the Return signed by\r\nShortland and Dr. Magrath, five were killed and twenty-eight wounded.\r\n\r\nA report was drawn up, after the inquiry instituted directly following\r\nthe event, by Admiral Duckworth and Major-General Brown, and signed by\r\nthe Assistant Commissioners at the Inquiry, King for the United States,\r\nand Larpent for Great Britain, which came to no satisfactory conclusion.\r\nIt was evident, it said, that the prisoners were in an excited state\r\nabout the non-arrival of ships to take them home, and that Shortland was\r\nirritated about the bread affair; that there was much unauthorized\r\nfiring, but that it was difficult exactly to apportion blame. This\r\nreport was utterly condemned by the committee of prisoners, who resented\r\nthe tragedy being styled ‘this unfortunate affair’, reproached King for\r\nhis lack of energy and unwarrantable self-restraint, and complained of\r\nthe hurried and imperfect way in which the inquiry was conducted and the\r\nevidence taken. At this distance of time an Englishman may ask: ‘If it\r\nwas known that peace between the two countries had been ratified on\r\nMarch 20, how came it that Americans were still kept in confinement and\r\ntreated as prisoners of war on April 6?’ On the other hand, it is hardly\r\npossible to accept the American view that the tragedy was the deliberate\r\nwork of an officer of His Majesty’s service in revenge for a slight.\r\n\r\nBy July, 1815, all the Americans but 450 had left, and the last Dartmoor\r\nwar-prisoners, 4,000 Frenchmen, taken at Ligny, came in. These poor\r\nfellows were easy to manage after the Americans; 2,500 of them came from\r\nPlymouth with only 300 Militiamen as guard, whilst for Americans the\r\nrule was man for man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DARTMOOR PRISON\r\n\r\n  Illustrating the ‘Massacre’ of 1815\r\n\r\n  A.

Store\r\n    Houses.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe last war-prisoners left Dartmoor in December, 1815, and from this\r\ntime until 1850 it was unoccupied, which partially accounts for the\r\nutter desecration of the burial-ground, until, under Captain Stopforth,\r\nit was tidied up in garden fashion, divided into two plots, one for\r\nAmericans, the other for Frenchmen, in the centre of each of which was\r\nplaced a memorial obelisk in 1865.\r\n\r\nThe present church at Princetown was built by war-prisoners, the\r\nstone-work being done by the French, the wood-work by the Americans. The\r\nEast Window bears the following inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘To the Glory of God and in memory of the American Prisoners of War who\r\nwere detained in the Dartmoor War Prison between the years 1809 and\r\n1815, and who helped to build this Church, especially of the 218 brave\r\nmen who died here on behalf of their country. This Window is presented\r\nby the National Society of United States Daughters of 1812. Dulce est\r\npro patria mori.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n                           SOME MINOR PRISONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, before the establishment of regular prisons\r\nbecame a necessity by the increasing flow of prisoners of war into\r\nBritain, accommodation for these men had to be found or made wherever it\r\nwas possible. With some of these minor prisons I shall deal in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WINCHESTER\r\n\r\nMeasured by the number of prisoners of war confined here, Winchester\r\nassuredly should rank as a major establishment, but it seems to have\r\nbeen regarded by the authorities rather as a receiving-house or a\r\ntransfer office than as a real prisoner settlement, possibly because the\r\nbuilding utilized—a pile of barracks which was originally intended by\r\nCharles the Second to be a palace on the plan of Versailles, but which\r\nwas never finished, and which was known as the King’s House Prison—was\r\nnot secure enough to be a House of Detention. It was burned down in\r\n1890.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 there were no less than 5,000 prisoners at Winchester. In 1761\r\nthe order for the withdrawal of the military from the city because of\r\nthe approaching elections occasioned much alarm, and brought vigorous\r\nprotests from leading inhabitants on account of the 4,000 prisoners of\r\nwar who would be left practically unguarded, especially as these men\r\nhappened to be just then in a ferment of excitement, and a general\r\noutbreak among them was feared. Should this take place, it was\r\nrepresented that nothing could prevent them from communicating with the\r\nshipping in Southampton River, and setting free their countrymen\r\nprisoners at Portchester and Forton Hospital, Gosport.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Howard visited Winchester. This was the year when the patients\r\nand crew of a captured French hospital ship, the _Ste. Julie_, brought\r\nfever into the prison, causing a heavy mortality.\r\n\r\nHoward reported that 1,062 prisoners were confined here, that the wards\r\nwere lofty and spacious, the airing yards large, that the meat and beer\r\nwere good, but that the bread, being made with leaven, and mixed with\r\nrye, was not so good as that served out to British prisoners. He\r\nrecommended that to prevent the prisoners from passing their days lying\r\nindolently in their hammocks, work-rooms should be provided. Several\r\nprisoners, at the time of his visit, were in the Dark Hole for\r\nattempting to escape, and he observed that to be condemned to forty\r\ndays’ confinement on half-rations in order to pay the ten shillings\r\nreward to the men who apprehended them seemed too severe. The hospital\r\nward was lofty and twenty feet wide. Each patient had a cradle, bedding,\r\nand sheets, and the attendance of the doctor was very good. He spoke\r\nhighly of Smith, the Agent, but recommended a more regular system of\r\nWar-Prison inspection.\r\n\r\nForgery was a prevalent crime among the Winchester prisoners. In 1780\r\ntwo prisoners gave information about a systematic manufacture of false\r\npassports in the prison, and described the process. They also revealed\r\nthe existence of a false key by which prisoners could escape into the\r\nfields, the maker of which had disappeared. They dared not say more, as\r\nthey were suspected by their fellow-prisoners of being informers, and\r\nprayed for release as reward.\r\n\r\nTo the letter conveying this information the Agent appended a note:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have been obliged this afternoon to take Honoré Martin and Apert out\r\nof the prison that they may go away with the division of prisoners who\r\nare to be discharged to-morrow, several prisoners having this morning\r\nentered the chamber in which they sleep, with naked knives, declaring\r\nmost resolutely they were determined to murder them if they could find\r\nthem, to prevent which their liberty was granted.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1810 two prisoners were brought to Winchester to be hanged for\r\nforging seven-shilling pieces. I think this must be the first instance\r\nof prisoners of war being hanged for forgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ROSCROW AND KERGILLIACK, NEAR PENRYN, CORNWALL\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great pains I have taken to get information about these\r\ntwo neighbouring prisons, the results are most meagre. Considering that\r\nthere were war-prisoners there continuously from the beginning of the\r\nSeven Years’ War in 1756 until the end of the century, that there were\r\n900 prisoners at Roscrow, and 600 at Kergilliack, it is surprising how\r\nabsolutely the memory of their sojourn has faded away locally, and how\r\nlittle information I have been able to elicit concerning them from such\r\nauthorities on matters Cornish as Mr. Thurstan Peter, Sir Arthur\r\nQuiller-Couch, Mr. Otho Peter, and Mr. Vawdrey of St. Budock. The\r\nearliest document referring to these prisoners which I have found is a\r\nletter of thanks from the prisoners at Kergilliack in 1757, for the\r\nbadly needed reform of the hospital, but I do not think that the two\r\nplaces ranked amongst the regular war-prisons until twenty years later.\r\nAt no time were they much more than adapted farms. Roscrow consisted of\r\na mansion, in a corner of which was a public-house, to which a series of\r\nsubstantial farm-buildings was attached, which, when surrounded by a\r\nwall, constituted the prison. Kergilliack, or Regilliack, as I have seen\r\nit written, was of much the same character.[11]\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the Roscrow prisoners, according to documents I found at the\r\nArchives Nationales in Paris, were nearly all privateersmen. Officers\r\nand men were herded together, which the former deeply resented; as they\r\ndid much else, such as being bullied by a low class of jailers, the\r\nbadness of the supplies, the rottenness of the shoes served out to them,\r\nthe crowded sleeping accommodation, the dirt, and lastly the fact that\r\npilchards formed a chief part of their diet.\r\n\r\nIn this year a Guernsey boy named Hamond revealed to the authorities a\r\nmine under the foundation of the house, five feet below the ground and\r\nfour feet in diameter, going out twenty yards towards the inside fence.\r\nHe had found the excavated earth distributed among the prisoners’\r\nhammocks, and told the turnkey. He was instantly removed, as he would\r\ncertainly have been murdered by the other prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel was a wonder of skill and perseverance. It was said that the\r\nexcavators had largely worked with nothing but their hands, and that\r\ntheir labour had been many times increased by the fact that in order to\r\navoid the constant occurrence of rock they had been obliged to make a\r\nwinding course.\r\n\r\nComplaints increased: the bad bread was often not delivered till 5 p.m.\r\ninstead of 8 a.m., the beer was undrinkable, and the proportion of bone\r\nto meat in the weighed allowance ridiculous. The Agent paying no\r\nattention to reiterated complaints, the following petition, signed at\r\nKergilliack as well as at Roscrow, was sent to the Transport Office\r\nCommissioners for\r\n\r\n\r\n‘that redress which we have a right to expect from Mr. Bannick’s [the\r\nAgent] exertions on our behalf; but, unfortunately for us, after making\r\nrepeated applications to him whenever chance threw him in our way, as he\r\nseldom visited the prison, we have the mortification of finding that our\r\nreasonable and just remonstrances have been treated with the most\r\nforbidding frowns and the distant arrogance of the most arbitrary Despot\r\nwhen he has been presented with a sample of bread delivered to us, or\r\nrather, rye, flour, and water cemented together, and at different times,\r\nand as black as our shoes.\r\n\r\n                            (Signed)\r\n                                    ‘THE GENERAL BODY OF FRENCH OFFICERS\r\n                                        CONFINED IN ROSCROW PRISON.’\r\n\r\n\r\nA further remonstrance was set forth that the Agent and his son, who was\r\nassociated with him, were bullies; that the surgeon neglected his\r\nduties; and that the living and sleeping quarters were bad and damp.\r\n\r\nThe only result I can find of these petitions, is a further exasperation\r\nof the prisoners by the stopping of all exchange privileges of those who\r\nhad signed them.\r\n\r\nThe following complaints about the hospital at Falmouth in the year 1757\r\nI have placed at the end of this notice, as I cannot be sure that they\r\nwere formulated by, or had anything to do with, foreign prisoners of\r\nwar. From the fact that they are included among a batch of documents at\r\nthe Record Office dealing with prisoners of war, I think it is quite\r\npossible that they may be associated with them, inasmuch as Falmouth,\r\nlike Dover, Deal, and other coast ports, was a sort of receiving office\r\nfor prisoners captured on privateers, previous to their disposal\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt was complained that:\r\n\r\n  1. No bouillon was served if no basin was brought: the allowance being\r\n       one small basin in 24 hours.\r\n\r\n  2. Half the beds had no sheets, and what sheets there were had not\r\n       been changed for six months.\r\n\r\n  3. Beds were so scarce that new arrivals were kept waiting in the open\r\n       yards.\r\n\r\n  4. The attendants were underpaid, and therefore useless.\r\n\r\n  5. No bandages were supplied, so that the patients’ own shirts had to\r\n       be torn up to make them.\r\n\r\n  6. Stimulants and meat were insufficient, and the best of what there\r\n       was the attendants secured beforehand.\r\n\r\n  7. Half-cured patients were often discharged to make room for others.\r\n\r\nFrom what Mr. Vawdrey, the Vicar of St. Budock, Falmouth, has written to\r\nme, it is certain that French officers were on parole in different\r\nplaces of this neighbourhood. Tradition says that those who died were\r\nburied beneath a large tree on the right hand of the north entrance of\r\nthe church. There are entries in the registers of the deaths of French\r\nprisoners, and, if there is no evidence of marriages, there is that\r\n‘some St. Budock girls appear to have made captivity more blessed for\r\nsome of them’. Some people at Meudon in Mawnan, named Courage, farmers,\r\ntrace their descent from a French lieutenant of that name. Mawnan\r\nregisters show French names. Pendennis Castle was used as a war-prison,\r\nboth for French from the Peninsula, and for Americans during the war of\r\n1812.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SHREWSBURY\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. J. E. Anden, M.A., F.R. Hist. S., of Tong, Shifnal,\r\nfor the following extracts from the diary of John Tarbuck, a shoemaker,\r\nof Shrewsbury:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘September, 1783. Six hundred hammocks were slung in the Orphan\r\nHospital, from which all the windows were removed, to convert it into a\r\nDutch prison, and as many captive sailors marched in. Many of the\r\ntownspeople go out to meet them, and amongst the rest Mr. Roger Yeomans,\r\nthe most corpulent man in the country, to the no small mirth of the\r\nprisoners, who, on seeing him, gave a great shout: “Huzza les Anglais!\r\nRoast beef for ever!” This exclamation was soon verified to their\r\nsatisfaction, as the Salop gentry made a subscription to buy them some\r\nin addition to that allowed by their victors, together with shoes,\r\njackets, and other necessaries. ’Twas pleasing to see the poor\r\ncreatures’ gratitude, for they’d sing you their songs, tho’ in a foreign\r\nland, and some companies of their youth would dance with amazing\r\ndexterity in figures totally unlike the English dances with a kind of\r\nregular confusion, yet with grace, ease, and truth to the music. I\r\nremember there was one black boy of such surprising agility that, had\r\nthe person seen him, who, speaking against the Abolition of the\r\nslave-trade, said there was only a link between the human and the brute\r\ncreation, it would have strengthened his favourite hypothesis, for he\r\nleaped about with more of the swiftness of the monkey than the man.\r\n\r\n‘I went one Sunday to Church with them, and I came away much more\r\nedified than from some sermons where I could tell all that was spoken.\r\nThe venerable appearance and the devotion evident in every look and\r\ngesture of the preacher, joined to the grave and decent deportment of\r\nhis hearers ... had a wonderful effect on my feelings and tended very\r\nmuch to solemnize my affections.\r\n\r\n‘May, 1785. Four of the Dutch prisoners escape by means of the privy and\r\nwere never retaken. Many others enlist in the English service, and are\r\nhissed and shouted at by their fellows, and deservedly so. The Swedes\r\nand Norwegians among them are marched away (being of neutral nations) to\r\nbe exchanged.’\r\n\r\n\r\nA newspaper of July 1784 (?) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘On Thursday last an unfortunate affair happened at the Dutch Prison,\r\nShrewsbury. A prisoner, behaving irregular, was desired by a guard to\r\ndesist, which was returned by the prisoner with abusive language and\r\nblows, and the prisoner, laying hold of the Centinel’s Firelock, forced\r\noff the bayonet, and broke the belt. Remonstrance proving fruitless, and\r\nsome more of the Prisoners joining their stubborn countryman, the\r\nCentinel was obliged to draw back and fire among them, which killed one\r\non the spot. The Ball went through his Body and wounded one more. The\r\nman that began the disturbance escaped unhurt.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prisoners left Shrewsbury about November 1785.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of a Shrewsbury newspaper in 1911 writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A generation ago there were people living who remembered the rebuilding\r\nof Montford Bridge by prisoners of war. They went out each Monday,\r\ntradition says, in carts and wagons, and were quartered there during the\r\nweek in farm-houses and cottages near their work, being taken back to\r\nShrewsbury at the end of each week.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe correspondence evoked by this letter, however, sufficiently proved\r\nthat this was nothing more than tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                YARMOUTH\r\n\r\nPrisoners were confined here during the Seven Years’ War, although no\r\nspecial buildings were set apart for their reception, and, as elsewhere,\r\nthey were simply herded with the common prisoners in the ordinary\r\nlock-up. In 1758 numerous complaints came to the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office\r\nfrom the prisoners here, about their bad treatment, the greed of the\r\njailer, the bad food, the lack of medical attendance and necessaries,\r\nand the misery of being lodged with the lowest class of criminals.\r\nPrisoners who were seriously ill were placed in the prison hospital; the\r\njailer used to intercept money contributed by the charitable for the\r\nbenefit of the prisoners, and only paid it over after the deduction of a\r\nlarge commission. The straw bedding was dirty, scanty, and rarely\r\nchanged; water had to be paid for, and there was hardly any airing\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAfter the building of Norman Cross Prison, Yarmouth became, like Deal\r\nand Falmouth, a mere receiving port, but an exceedingly busy one, the\r\nprisoners being landed there direct from capture, and generally taken on\r\nby water to Lynn, whence they were conveyed by canal to Peterborough.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Norwich Mercury_ of 1905 I take the following notes on\r\nYarmouth by the late Rev. G. N. Godwin:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Columns of prisoners, often 1,000 strong, were marched from Yarmouth to\r\nNorwich, and were there lodged in the Castle. They frequently expressed\r\ntheir gratitude for the kindness shown them by the Mayor and citizens.\r\nOne smart privateer captain coolly walked out of the Castle in the\r\ncompany of some visitors, and, needless to say, did not return.\r\n\r\n‘From Yarmouth they were marched to King’s Lynn, halting at Costessy,\r\nSwanton Mosley (where their “barracks” are still pointed out), East\r\nDereham, where some were lodged in the detached church tower, and thence\r\nto Lynn. Here they were lodged in a large building, afterwards used as a\r\nwarehouse, now pulled down. [For a further reference to East Dereham and\r\nits church tower, see p. 453.]\r\n\r\n‘At Lynn they took water, and were conveyed in barges and lighters\r\nthrough the Forty Foot, the Hundred Foot, the Paupers’ Cut, and the Nene\r\nto Peterborough, whence they marched to Norman Cross.\r\n\r\n‘In 1797, 28 prisoners escaped from the gaol at Yarmouth by undermining\r\nthe wall and the row adjoining. All but five of them were retaken. In\r\nthe same year 4 prisoners broke out of the gaol, made their way to\r\nLowestoft, where they stole a boat from the beach, and got on board a\r\nsmall vessel, the crew of which they put under the hatches, cut the\r\ncable, and put out to sea. Seven hours later the crew managed to regain\r\nthe deck, a rough and tumble fight ensued, one of the Frenchmen was\r\nknocked overboard, and the others were ultimately lodged in Yarmouth\r\ngaol.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EDINBURGH\r\n\r\nFor the following details about a prison which, although of importance,\r\ncannot from its size be fairly classed among the chief Prisoners of War\r\ndépôts of Britain, I am largely indebted to the late Mr. Macbeth Forbes,\r\nwho most generously gave me permission to use freely his article in the\r\n_Bankers’ Magazine_ of March 1899. I emphasize his liberality inasmuch\r\nas a great deal of the information in this article is of a nature only\r\nprocurable by one with particular and peculiar facilities for so doing.\r\nI allude to the system of bank-note forgery pursued by the prisoners.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh Castle was first used as a place of confinement for prisoners\r\nof war during the Seven Years’ War, and, like Liverpool, this use was\r\nmade of it chiefly on account of its convenient proximity to the waters\r\nhaunted by privateers. The very first prisoners brought in belonged to\r\nthe _Chevalier Bart_ privateer, captured off Tynemouth by H.M.S.\r\n_Solebay_, in April 1757, the number of them being 28, and in July of\r\nthe same year a further 108 were added.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In the autumn of 1759 a piteous appeal was addressed to the publishers\r\nof the _Edinburgh Evening Courant_ on behalf of the French prisoners of\r\nwar in Edinburgh Castle by one who “lately beheld some hundreds of\r\nFrench prisoners, many of them about naked (some without any other\r\nclothing but shirts and breeches and even these in rags), conducted\r\nalong the High Street to the Castle.” The writer says that many who saw\r\nthe spectacle were moved to tears, and he asked that relief might be\r\ngiven by contributing clothing to these destitute men. This letter met\r\nwith a favourable response from the citizens, and a book of\r\nsubscriptions was opened forthwith. The prisoners were visited and found\r\nto number 362. They were reported to be “in a miserable condition, many\r\nalmost naked,” and winter approaching. There were, however, revilers of\r\nthis charitable movement, who said that the public were being imposed\r\nupon; that the badly clothed were idle fellows who disposed of their\r\nbelongings; that they had been detected in the Castle cutting their\r\nshoes, stockings, and hammocks into pieces, in the prospect of getting\r\nthese articles renewed. “One fellow, yesterday, got twenty bottles of\r\nale for a suit of clothes given him by the good people of the town in\r\ncharity, and this he boasted of to one of the servants in the sutlery.”\r\n\r\n‘The promoters of the movement expressed their “surprise at the\r\nendeavours used to divert the public from pursuing so humane a\r\ndesign.”.... They also pointed out that the prisoners only received an\r\nallowance of 6_d._ a day, from which the contractor’s profit was taken,\r\nso that little remained for providing clothes. An estimate was obtained\r\nof the needs of the prisoners, and a list drawn up of articles wanted.\r\nOf the 362 persons confined 8 were officers, whose subsistence money was\r\n1s. a day, and they asked no charity of the others; no fewer than 238\r\nhad no shirt, and 108 possessed only one. Their other needs were equally\r\ngreat. The “City Hospitals for Young Maidens” offered to make shirts for\r\ntwopence each, and sundry tailors to make a certain number of jackets\r\nand breeches for nothing. The prisoners had an airing ground, but as it\r\nwas necessary to obtain permission before visiting them, the chance they\r\nhad of disposing of any of their work was very slight indeed.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Fergusson, clerk to Dr. James Walker, the Agent for the\r\nprisoners of war in the Castle, described as a man of fine instincts,\r\nseems to have been one of the few officials who, brought into daily\r\ncontact with the prisoners, learned to sympathize with them, and to do\r\nwhat lay in their power to mitigate the prisoners’ hard lot.\r\n\r\nEarly in May 1763, the French prisoners in the Castle, numbering 500,\r\nwere embarked from Leith to France, the Peace of Paris having been\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War with France, Edinburgh Castle again\r\nreceived French prisoners, mostly, as before, privateersmen, the number\r\nbetween 1796 and 1801 being 1,104. In the later Napoleonic wars the\r\nCastle was the head-quarters of Scotland for distributing the prisoners,\r\nthe commissioned officers to the various parole towns of which notice\r\nwill be taken in the chapters treating of the paroled prisoners in\r\nScotland, and the others to the great dépôts at Perth and Valleyfield.\r\nWe shall see when we come to deal with the paroled foreign officers in\r\nScotland in what pleasant places, as a rule, their lines were cast, and\r\nhow effectively they contrived to make the best of things, but it was\r\nvery much otherwise with the rank and file in confinement.\r\n\r\n‘An onlooker’, says Mr. Forbes, ‘has described the appearance of the\r\nprisoners at Edinburgh Castle. He says:—These poor men were allowed to\r\nwork at their tasteful handicrafts in small sheds or temporary workshops\r\nat the Castle, behind the palisades which separated them from their free\r\ncustomers outside. There was just room between the bars of the palisade\r\nfor them to hand through their exquisite work, and to receive in return\r\nthe modest prices which they charged. As they sallied forth from their\r\ndungeons, so they returned to them at night. The dungeons, partly rock\r\nand partly masonry, of Edinburgh Castle, are historic spots which appeal\r\nalike to the sentiment and the imagination. They are situate in the\r\nsouth and east of the Castle, and the date of them goes far back.’ It is\r\nunnecessary to describe what may still be seen, practically unchanged\r\nsince the great war-times, by every visitor to Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Howard visited Edinburgh during his tour round the prisons of\r\nBritain. His report is by no means bad. He found sixty-four prisoners in\r\ntwo rooms formerly used as barracks; in one room they lay in couples in\r\nstraw-lined boxes against the wall, with two coverlets to each box. In\r\nthe other room they had hammocks duly fitted with mattresses. The\r\nregulations were hung up according to law—an important fact, inasmuch as\r\nin other prisons, such as Pembroke, where the prison agents purposely\r\nomitted to hang them up, the prisoners remained in utter ignorance of\r\ntheir rights and their allowances. Howard reported the provisions to be\r\nall good, and noted that at the hospital house some way off, where were\r\nfourteen sick prisoners, the bedding and sheets were clean and\r\nsufficient, and the medical attention good.\r\n\r\nThis satisfactory state of matters seems to have lasted, for in 1795 the\r\nfollowing letter was written by the French prisoners in the Castle to\r\nGeneral Dundas:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Les prisonniers de guerre français détenus au château d’Edinburgh ne\r\npeuvent que se louer de l’attention et du bon traitement qu’ils ont reçu\r\nde Com.-Gén. Dundas et officiers des brigades Écossoises, en foi de quoi\r\nnous livrons le présent.\r\n\r\n                                                            ‘FR. LEROY.’\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibly the ancient _camaraderie_ of the Scots and French nations may\r\nhave had something to do with this pleasant condition of things, for in\r\n1797 Dutch prisoners confined in the Castle complained about ill\r\ntreatment and the lack of clothing, and the authorities consented to\r\ntheir being removed to ‘a more airy and comfortable situation at\r\nFountainbridge’.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 the Rev. Mr. FitzSimmons, of the Episcopal Chapel, an\r\nEnglishman, was arraigned before the High Court of Justiciary for aiding\r\nin the escape of four French prisoners from the Castle, by concealing\r\nthem in his house, and taking them to a Newhaven fishing boat belonging\r\nto one Neil Drysdale, which carried them to the Isle of Inchkeith,\r\nwhence they escaped to France. Two of them had sawn through the dungeon\r\nbars with a sword-blade which they had contrived to smuggle in. The\r\nother two were parole prisoners. He was sentenced to three months’\r\nimprisonment in the Tolbooth.\r\n\r\nA French prisoner in 1799, having learned at what hour the dung which\r\nhad been collected in the prison would be thrown over the wall, got\r\nhimself put into the hand-barrow used for its conveyance, was covered\r\nover with litter, and was thrown down several feet; but, being\r\ndiscovered by the sentinels in his fall, they presented their pieces\r\nwhile he was endeavouring to conceal himself. The poor bruised and\r\naffrighted fellow supplicated for mercy, and waited on his knees until\r\nhis jailers came up to take him back to prison.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 forty-nine prisoners contrived to get out of the Castle at one\r\ntime. They cut a hole through the bottom of the parapet wall at the\r\nsouth-west corner, below the ‘Devil’s Elbow,’ and let themselves down by\r\na rope which they had been smuggling in by small sections for weeks\r\npreviously. One man lost his hold, and fell, and was mortally injured.\r\nFive were retaken the next day, and fourteen got away along the Glasgow\r\nroad. Some were retaken later near Linlithgow in the Polmount\r\nplantations, exhausted with hunger. They had planned to get to\r\nGrangemouth, where they hoped to get on board a smuggler. They confessed\r\nthat the plot was of long planning. Later still, six more were\r\nrecaptured. They had made for Cramond, where they had stolen a boat,\r\nsailed up the Firth, and landed near Hopetoun House, intending to go to\r\nPort Glasgow by land. These poor fellows said that they had lived for\r\nthree days on raw turnips. Not one of the forty-nine got away.\r\n\r\nI now come to the science of forgery as practised by the foreign\r\nprisoners of war in Scotland, and I shall be entirely dependent upon Mr.\r\nMacbeth Forbes for my information.\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh prisoners were busy at this work between 1811 and the year\r\nof their departure, 1814.\r\n\r\nThe first reputed case was that of a Bank of Scotland one-guinea note,\r\ndiscovered in 1811. It was not a very skilful performance, for the\r\nforged note was three-fourths of an inch longer than the genuine, and\r\nthe lettering on it was not engraved, but done with pen and printing\r\nink. But this defect was remedied, for, three weeks after the discovery,\r\nthe plate of a guinea note was found by the miller in the mill lade at\r\nStockbridge (the north side of Edinburgh), in cleaning out the lade.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 a man was tried for the possession of six one-pound forged notes\r\nwhich had been found concealed between the sole of his foot and his\r\nstocking. His story as to how he came into possession of them seems to\r\nhave satisfied the judge, and he was set free; but he afterwards\r\nconfessed that he had received them from a soldier of the Cambridge\r\nMilitia under the name of ‘pictures’ in the house of a grocer at\r\nPenicuik, near the Valleyfield Dépôt, and that the soldier had, at his,\r\nthe accused man’s, desire, purchased them for 2_s._ each from the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nIn July 1812 seven French prisoners of war escaped from Edinburgh\r\nTolbooth, whither they had been transferred from the Castle to take\r\ntheir trial for the forgery of bank-notes. ‘They were confined’, says a\r\ncontemporary newspaper, ‘in the north-west room on the third story, and\r\nthey had penetrated the wall, though very thick, till they got into the\r\nchimney of Mr. Gilmour’s shop (on the ground floor), into which they\r\ndescended by means of ropes. As they could not force their way out of\r\nthe shop, they ascended a small stair to the room above, from which they\r\ntook out half the window and descended one by one into the street, and\r\ngot clear off. In the course of the morning one of them was retaken in\r\nthe Grass Market, being traced by the sooty marks of his feet. We\r\nunderstand that, except one, they all speak broken English. They left a\r\nnote on the table of the shop saying that they had taken nothing away.’\r\n\r\nAfterwards three of the prisoners were taken at Glasgow, and another in\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\nFrom the first discoveries of forgeries by prisoners of war, the\r\nScottish banks chiefly affected by them had in a more or less\r\nsatisfactory way combined to take steps to prevent and to punish\r\nforgeries, but it was not until they offered a reward of £100 for\r\ninformation leading to the discovery of persons forging or issuing their\r\nnotes that a perceptible check to the practice was made. This\r\nadvertisement was printed and put outside the dépôt walls for the\r\nmilitia on guard, a French translation was posted up inside for the\r\nprisoners, and copies of it were sent to the Agents at all parole towns.\r\nWith reference to this last, let it be said to the credit of the foreign\r\nofficers on parole, both in England and Scotland, that, although a\r\nFrenchman has written to the contrary, there are no more than two\r\nrecorded instances of officers on parole being prosecuted or suspected\r\nof the forgery of bank-notes. (See pp. 320 and 439.) Of passport\r\nforgeries there are a few cases, and the forgery mentioned on p. 439 may\r\nhave been of passports and not of bank-notes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, says Mr. Macbeth Forbes, the military authorities were\r\ncontinually on the _qui vive_ for forgers. The governors of the\r\ndifferent dépôts ordered the turnkeys to examine narrowly notes coming\r\nin and out of prison. The militiamen had also to be watched, as they\r\nacted so frequently as intermediaries, as for instance:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In November 1813 Mr. Aitken, the keeper of the Canongate Tolbooth,\r\ndetected and took from the person of a private soldier in a militia\r\nregiment stationed over the French prisoners in Penicuik, and who had\r\ncome into the Canongate Prison to see a friend, forged guineas and\r\ntwenty-shilling notes on two different banks in this city, and two of\r\nthem in the country, amounting to nearly £70. The soldier was\r\nimmediately given over to the civil power, and from thence to the\r\nregiment to which he belonged, until the matter was further\r\ninvestigated.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn July 1813 the clerk of the Valleyfield Dépôt sent to the banks\r\ntwenty-six forged guinea notes which were about to be sold, but were\r\ndetected by the turnkey.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchmen seem to have chiefly selected for imitation the notes of\r\nthe Bank of Scotland, and the Commercial Banking Company of Scotland, as\r\nthese had little or no pictorial delineation, and consisted almost\r\nentirely of engraved penmanship. The forgers had to get suitable paper,\r\nand, as there were no steel pens in those days, a few crow quills served\r\ntheir purpose. They had confederates who watched the ins and outs of the\r\nturnkey; and, in addition to imitating the lettering on the face of the\r\nnote, they had to forge the watermark, the seals of the bank, and the\r\nGovernment stamp. The bones of their ration food formed, literally, the\r\ngroundwork of the forger’s productions, and as these had to be properly\r\nscraped and smoothed into condition before being in a state to be worked\r\nupon with ordinary pocket-knives, if the result was often so crude as to\r\ndeceive only the veriest yokel, the Scottish banks might be thankful\r\nthat engraving apparatus was unprocurable.\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement of the Bank of Scotland emphasizes this\r\ncrudity of execution:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Several forged notes, in imitation of the notes of the governor and\r\ncompany of the Bank of Scotland, having appeared, chiefly in the\r\nneighbourhood of the dépôts of French prisoners of war, a caution is\r\nhereby, on the part of the said governors and company, given against\r\nreceiving such forged notes in payment. And whoever shall, within three\r\nmonths from the date hereof, give such information as shall be found\r\nsufficient, on lawful trial, to convict any one concerned in forging or\r\nfeloniously uttering any of the said notes, shall receive a reward of a\r\nhundred pounds sterling. These forged notes are executed by the hand\r\nwith a pen or pencil, without any engraving. In most of them the body of\r\nthe note has the appearance of foreign handwriting. The names of the\r\nbank officers are mostly illegible or ill-spelled. The ornamental\r\ncharacters of the figures generally ill-executed. The seals are very\r\nill-imitated. To this mark particular attention is requested.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seals, bearing the arms of the Bank of Scotland, are of sheep’s\r\nbone, and were impressed upon the note with a hammer, also probably of\r\nbone, since all metal tools were prohibited. The partially executed\r\nforgery of a Bank of Scotland guinea note shows the process of imitating\r\nthe lettering on the note in dotted outline, for which the forgers had\r\ndoubtless some good reason, which is not at once patent to us.\r\n\r\nUntil 1810 the punishment for forgery was the hulks. During that year\r\nthe law in England took a less merciful view of the crime, and offenders\r\nwere sentenced to death; and until 1829, when the last man was hanged\r\nfor forgery, this remained the law.\r\n\r\nAs to Scotland Mr. Forbes says: ‘The administration was probably not so\r\nsevere as in England ... no French prisoner suffered anything more than\r\na slight incarceration, and a subsequent relegation to the prison ships,\r\nwhere some thousands of his countrymen already were.’\r\n\r\nArmed with a Home Office permit I visited the prisons in the rock of\r\nEdinburgh Castle. Owing to the facts that most of them have been\r\nconverted into military storerooms and that their substance does not\r\nlend itself readily to destruction, they remain probably very much as\r\nwhen they were filled with the war-prisoners, and, with their heavily\r\nbuilt doors and their strongly barred apertures, which cannot be called\r\nwindows, their darkness and cold, the silence of their position high\r\nabove even the roar of a great city, convey still to the minds of the\r\nvisitors of to-day a more real impression of the meaning of the word\r\n‘imprisonment’ than does any other war-prison, either extant or\r\npictured. At Norman Cross, at Portchester, at Stapleton, at Dartmoor, at\r\nPerth, there were at any rate open spaces for airing grounds, but at\r\nEdinburgh there could have been none, unless the narrow footway, outside\r\nthe line of caverns, from the wall of which the precipice falls sheer\r\ndown, was so utilized.\r\n\r\nNear the entrance to the French prisons the following names are visible\r\non the wall:\r\n\r\nCharles Jobien, Calais, 1780.\r\n\r\nMorel de Calais, 1780.\r\n\r\n1780. Proyol prisonnier nee natif de bourbonnais (?).\r\n\r\nWith the Peace of 1814 came the jail-delivery, and it caused one of the\r\nweirdest scenes known in that old High Street so inured to weird scenes.\r\nThe French prisoners were marched down by torchlight to the transport at\r\nLeith, and thousands of citizens lined the streets. Down the highway\r\nwent the liberated ones, singing the war-songs of the Revolution—the\r\n_Marseillaise_ and the _Ça ira_. Wildly enthusiastic were the pale,\r\nhaggard-looking prisoners of war, but the enthusiasm was not exhausted\r\nwith them, for they had a great send-off from the populace.\r\n\r\nIn Sir T. E. Colebrooke’s _Life of Mountstuart Elphinstone_, Mr. John\r\nRussell of Edinburgh writes that when he first knew Mountstuart, his\r\nfather, Lord Elphinstone, was Governor of Edinburgh Castle, in which\r\nwere confined a great number of French prisoners of war. With these\r\nprisoners the boy Mountstuart loved to converse, and, learning from them\r\ntheir revolutionary songs, he used to walk about singing the\r\n_Marseillaise_, _Ça ira_, and _Les Aristocrates à la Lanterne_, much to\r\nthe disgust of the British officers, who, however, dared not check such\r\na proceeding on the part of the son of the Governor. Mountstuart also\r\nwore his hair long in accordance with the revolutionary fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n                    LOUIS VANHILLE: A FAMOUS ESCAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nI devoted Chapter VII to the record of Tom Souville, a famous\r\nship-prison-breaker, and in this I hope to give quite as interesting and\r\nromantic an account of the career of Louis Vanhille, who was remarkable\r\nin his method in that he seemed never to be in a hurry to get out of\r\nEngland, but actually to enjoy the power he possessed of keeping himself\r\nuninterfered with for a whole year in a country where the hue and cry\r\nafter him was ceaseless.\r\n\r\nAt the outset I must make my acknowledgement to M. Pariset of the\r\nUniversity of Nancy, for permission to use his monograph upon this\r\nreally remarkable man.\r\n\r\nLouis Vanhille, purser of the _Pandour_ privateer, was sent to\r\nLaunceston on parole May 12, 1806. He is described as a small man of\r\nthirty-two, of agreeable face and figure, although small-pox marked,\r\nfair as befitted his Flemish origin, and speaking English almost\r\nperfectly. He was socially gifted, he painted and caricatured, could\r\ndress hair, and could make mats, and weave bracelets in seventeen\r\npatterns. He was well-off to boot, as the _Pandour_ had been a\r\nsuccessful ship, and he had plenty of prize money.\r\n\r\nIn Launceston he lodged with John Tyeth, a pious Baptist brewer. Tyeth\r\nhad three married daughters and two unmarried, Fanny and a younger, who\r\nkept the Post Office at Launceston. Although Tyeth was a Baptist, one of\r\nhis daughters was married to Bunsell, the Rector of Launceston, so that\r\ndecorum and preciseness prevailed in the local atmosphere, to which\r\nVanhille politically adapted himself so readily as to become a convert\r\nto Tyeth’s creed. In addition he paid marked attention to Miss Fanny,\r\nwho was plain-looking but kept the Post Office; an action which\r\noccasioned watchfulness on the part of Tyeth _père_, who, in common with\r\nmost Englishmen of his day, regarded all Frenchmen as atheists and\r\nrevolutionaries. Vanhille’s manner and accomplishments won him friends\r\nall round. Miss Johanna Colwell, an old maid, a sentimental worker of\r\nstraw hats, who lived opposite the brewery, pitied him. Further on, at\r\nMr. Pearson’s, lodged Vanhille’s great friend, Dr. Derouge, an army\r\nsurgeon, who cured Vanhille of small-pox. Then there was Dr. Mabyn of\r\nCamelford, Dr. Frankland, R.N., John Rowe the tailor, Dale the\r\nironmonger, who, although tradesmen, were of that well-to-do, highly\r\nrespectable calibre which in old-time country towns like Launceston\r\nplaced them on a footing of friendliness with the ‘quality’. Vanhille\r\nseems to have settled himself down to become quite Anglicized, and to\r\nforget that he was a prisoner on parole, and that any such individual\r\nexisted as Mr. Spettigue, the Agent. He went over to Camelford to dine\r\nwith Dr. Mabyn; he rode to Tavistock on the Tyeth’s pony to visit the\r\nPearces, ironmongers of repute, and particularly to see the Misses Annie\r\nand Elizabeth Penwarden, gay young milliners who spoke French. He was\r\nalso much in the society of Fanny Tyeth, made expeditions with her to\r\nsee ‘Aunt Tyeth’ at Tavistock, and was regarded as her _fiancé_.\r\n\r\nDr. Derouge began to weary of captivity, and tried without success to\r\nget exchanged. The reason given for his non-success was that he had got\r\na girl with child. Launceston was scandalized; only a Frenchman could do\r\nsuch a thing. The authorities had to find some one to pay for the\r\nchild’s subsistence as the mother could not afford to, and so Proctor,\r\nGuardian of the Poor, and Spettigue, the Agent, fastened it on Dr.\r\nDerouge, and he was ordered to pay £25. But he could not; so Vanhille,\r\nwho had come into some money upon the death of his mother, paid it. What\r\nfollowed is not quite clear. In a letter dated December 5, 1811,\r\nSpettigue, in a letter to the Admiralty, says that Derouge and Vanhille\r\ntried to escape, but were prevented by information given by one\r\nBurlangier, ‘garde-magasin des services réunis de l’armée de Portugal.’\r\nHe reported their absences at Camelford, and finally they were ordered\r\nto Dartmoor on December 12, 1811. The Transport Office instructed\r\nSpettigue to keep a watch on Tyeth and others. Launceston was angry at\r\nthis; it missed Derouge and Vanhille, and went so far as to get the\r\nMember of Parliament, Giddy, to address the Transport Office on the\r\nmatter, and request their reinstatement on parole, but the reply was\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nAt Dartmoor, Vanhille and Derouge were sent to the subalterns’ quarters.\r\nVery soon the attractive personality of Vanhille led him to an\r\ninfluential position among the prisoners, and he was elected their\r\nrepresentative in all matters of difference between them and the\r\nauthorities, although Cotgrave, the Governor, refused to acknowledge him\r\nas such, saying that he preferred a prisoner of longer standing, and one\r\nwhom he knew better.\r\n\r\nVanhille now determined to get out of Dartmoor. To reach France direct\r\nwas difficult, but it was feasible by America, as he had a sister well\r\nmarried in New Orleans who could help him.\r\n\r\nAt the daily market held at the prison gate Vanhille became acquainted\r\nwith Mary Ellis. Piece by piece she brought him from Tavistock a\r\ndisguise—an old broad-brimmed hat, big boots, and brown stockings, and\r\nby August 21, 1812, he was ready. On that day he received from his\r\ncomrades a sort of testimonial or letter of recommendation for use after\r\nhis escape at any place where there might be Frenchmen:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Le comité représentant les officiers militaires et marchands détenus\r\ndans la prison Royale de Dartmoor certifient que Louis Vanhille est un\r\ndigne et loyal Français, et un compagnon d’infortune digne de tous les\r\négards de ses compatriotes . . . pour lui servir et valoir ce que de\r\nraison en cas de mutation de prison.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day he put on his disguise, mixed with the market folk, crossed\r\nthe court of his quarter, and the market place, passed two sentries who\r\ntook him for a potato merchant, got to the square in the middle of which\r\nwere the Agent’s house and offices, passed another gate, the sentry at\r\nwhich took no notice of him, turned sharp to the right by the stables\r\nand the water reservoir, and got on to the main road. He walked rapidly\r\non towards Tavistock, and that night slept under the Tyeth roof at\r\nLaunceston—a bold policy and only to be adopted by one who knew his\r\nground thoroughly well, and who felt sure that he was safer, known in\r\nLaunceston, than he would be as a stranger in Plymouth or other ports.\r\n\r\nNext day he went to Camelford, and called on Dr. Mabyn, who said:\r\n‘Monsieur Vanhille, comme ami je suis heureux de vous voir, mais à\r\nprésent je ne puis vous donner asile sous mon toit,’ Thence he went to\r\nPadstow, but no boatman would take him to Bristol or Cork, so he\r\nreturned to Launceston and remained there two days. Here he bought a\r\nmap, changed his disguise, and became Mr. Williams, a pedlar of odds and\r\nends. Thence he went on to Bideford, Appledore, and by boat to Newport,\r\nthence to Abergavenny, a parole town, where he met Palierne, an old\r\nLaunceston comrade; thence back to Launceston, where he rested a couple\r\nof days. Then, always on foot, he went to Exeter, Okehampton, and\r\nTawton, took wagon to London, where he only stayed a night, then on to\r\nChatham—a dangerous neighbourhood on account of the hulks, and back to\r\nAbergavenny via Guildford, Petersfield, Alresford, Winchester,\r\nSalisbury, Warminster, Bath, and Bristol, arriving at Abergavenny on\r\nSeptember 21, 1812.[12]\r\n\r\nFrom Abergavenny Vanhille went by Usk to Bristol, but could find no\r\nsuitable ship to take him to America, so he took coach back to\r\nLaunceston, and spent two weeks there with the Tyeths, which would seem\r\nto show that Spettigue was either purposely blind or very stupid.\r\nVanhille then crossed Cornwall rapidly to Falmouth—always, be it\r\nremembered, as a pedlar. Falmouth was a dangerous place, being the chief\r\nport for the Cartel service with Morlaix, and a strict look-out was kept\r\nthere for passengers intending to cross the Channel. Vanhille went to\r\nthe _Blue Anchor_ Inn, and here he met the famous escape agent, Thomas\r\nFeast Moore, _alias_ Captain Harman, &c., who at once recognized what he\r\nwas, and proffered his services, stating that he had carried many French\r\nofficers over safely. This was true, but what he omitted to state was\r\nthat he was at present in the Government service, having been pardoned\r\nfor his misdeeds as an escape agent on condition that he made use of his\r\nexperience by giving the Government information about intending\r\nescapers.[13]\r\n\r\nVanhille wanted no aid to escape, but he cleared out from Falmouth at\r\nonce, was that evening at Wadebridge, the next day at Saltash, then,\r\navoiding Launceston, went by Okehampton, Moreton-Hampstead, and Exeter\r\nto Cullompton, and thence by coach to Bristol, where he arrived on\r\nOctober 15, 1812.\r\n\r\nAfter his escape from Dartmoor, this extraordinary man had been\r\nfifty-five days travelling on foot, in carriage, and by boat, and had\r\ncovered 1,238 miles, by far the greater number of which he tramped, and\r\nthis with the hue and cry after him and offers of reward for his arrest\r\nposted up everywhere.\r\n\r\nHe now dropped the pedlar pretence and became an ordinary Briton. At\r\nBristol he learned that the _Jane_, Captain Robert Andrews, would leave\r\nfor Jamaica next month. He corresponded with his Launceston friends, who\r\nthroughout had been true to him, and, in replying, the Tyeths had to be\r\nmost careful, assuming signatures and disguising handwriting, and Miss\r\nFanny at the Post Office would with her own hands obliterate the\r\npost-mark. Old Tyeth sent him kind and pious messages. On November 10\r\nthe _Jane_ left Bristol, but was detained at Cork a month, waiting for a\r\nconvoy, and did not reach Montego Bay, Jamaica, until January 2, 1813.\r\nFrom Jamaica there were frequent opportunities of getting to America,\r\nand Vanhille had every reason to congratulate himself at last on being a\r\nfree man.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Customs people in Jamaica were particularly on the\r\nalert for spies and runaways, especially as we were at war with the\r\nUnited States. Vanhille was suspected of being what he was, and the\r\nexamination of his papers not being satisfactory, he was arrested and\r\nsent home, and on May 20, 1813, found himself a prisoner at Forton. He\r\nwas sent up to London and examined by Jones, of Knight and Jones,\r\nsolicitors to the Admiralty, with a view of extracting from him\r\ninformation concerning his accomplices in Launceston, a town notorious\r\nfor its French proclivities.\r\n\r\nJones writes under date of June 14, 1813, to Bicknell, solicitor to the\r\nTransport Office, that he has examined Vanhille, who peremptorily\r\nrefuses to make any disclosures which may implicate the persons\r\nconcerned in harbouring him after he had escaped from Dartmoor, and who\r\nultimately got him out of the kingdom. He hopes, however, to reach them\r\nby other means.\r\n\r\nHarsh treatment was now tried upon him, he was half starved, and as he\r\nwas now penniless could not remedy matters by purchase. In three weeks\r\nhe was sent on board the _Crown Prince_ hulk at Chatham, and later to\r\nthe _Glory_. Correspondence between him and Dr. Derouge at Launceston\r\nwas discovered, and Derouge was sent to a Plymouth hulk. Dale, the\r\nLaunceston ironmonger, who had been one of the little friendly circle in\r\nthat town, had fallen into evil ways, and was now starving in Plymouth.\r\nJones, the Admiralty lawyer, received a communication from him saying\r\nthat for a consideration he would denounce all Vanhille’s friends. He\r\nwas brought up to London, and he told all their names, with the result\r\nthat they were summoned. But nothing could be got out of them. Mrs.\r\nWilkins at the inn, who for some reason disliked Vanhille, would have\r\ngiven information, but she had none to give.\r\n\r\nDale was sent back to Plymouth, saying that if he could see Dr. Derouge,\r\nwho would not suspect him, he would get the wanted information. So the\r\ntwo men met in a special cabin, and rum was brought. Derouge,\r\nunsuspecting, tells all the story of the escape from Dartmoor, and\r\nbrings in the name of Mary Ellis, who had provided Vanhille with his\r\ndisguise. Then he begins to suspect Dale’s object, and will not utter\r\nanother word.\r\n\r\nDale is sent to Launceston to get more information, but fails; resolves\r\nto find out Mary Ellis at Tavistock, but five weeks elapse, and no more\r\nis heard of him, except that he arrived there half dead with wet and\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of 1814 brought release to Vanhille, and on April 19 he\r\nreached Calais.\r\n\r\nM. Pariset concludes his story with the following remark: ‘Vanhille\r\navait senti battre le cœur anglais qui est, comme chacun sait,\r\nbienveillant et fidèle, après qu’il s’est donné.’\r\n\r\nI should here say that M. Pariset’s story does not go further than the\r\ncapture of Vanhille in Jamaica. The sequel I have taken from the\r\ncorrespondence at the Record Office. I have been told that the name of\r\nVanhille is by no means forgotten in Launceston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n                           THE PRISON SYSTEM\r\n                          PRISONERS ON PAROLE\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the consideration of the parole system, we reach what is\r\nfor many reasons the most interesting chapter in a dark history. Life on\r\nthe hulks and in the prisons was largely a sealed book to the outside\r\npublic, and, brutal in many respects as was the age covered by our\r\nstory, there can be little question that if the British public had been\r\nmade more aware of what went on behind the wooden walls of the prison\r\nships and the stone walls of the prisons, its opinion would have\r\ndemanded reforms and remedies which would have spared our country from a\r\ndeep, ineffaceable, and, it must be added, a just reproach.\r\n\r\nBut the prisoners on parole played a large part in the everyday social\r\nlife of many parts of England, Wales, and Scotland, for at least sixty\r\nyears—a period long enough to leave a clear impression behind of their\r\nlives, their romances, their virtues, their vices, of all, in fact,\r\nwhich makes interesting history—and, although in one essential\r\nparticular they seem to have fallen very far short of the traditional\r\nstandard of honour, the memory of them is still that of a polished,\r\nrefined, and gallant race of gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThe parole system, by which officers of certain ratings were permitted,\r\nunder strict conditions to which they subscribed on their honour, to\r\nreside in certain places, was in practice at any rate at the beginning\r\nof the Seven Years’ War, and in 1757 the following were the parole\r\ntowns:\r\n\r\nIn the West: Redruth, Launceston, Callington, Falmouth, Tavistock,\r\nTorrington, Exeter, Crediton, Ashburton, Bideford, Okehampton, Helston,\r\nAlresford, Basingstoke, Chippenham, Bristol, Sodbury (Gloucestershire),\r\nand Bishop’s Waltham. In the South: Guernsey, Ashford, Tenterden,\r\nTonbridge, Wye (Kent), Goudhurst, Sevenoaks, Petersfield, and Romsey. In\r\nthe North: Dundee and Newcastle-on-Tyne. Kinsale in Ireland, Beccles in\r\nSuffolk, and Whitchurch in Shropshire. At first I had doubts if\r\nprisoners on parole were at open ports like Falmouth, Bristol, and\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, but an examination of the documents at the Record\r\nOffice in London and the Archives Nationales in Paris established the\r\nfact, although they ceased to be there after a short time. Not only does\r\nit seem that parole rules were more strictly enforced at this time than\r\nthey were later, but that violation of them was regarded as a crime by\r\nthe Governments of the offenders. Also, there was an arrangement, or at\r\nany rate an understanding, between England and France that officers who\r\nhad broken their parole by escaping, should, if discovered in their own\r\ncountry, either be sent back to the country of their imprisonment, or be\r\nimprisoned in their own country. Thus, we read under date 1757:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘René Brisson de Dunkerque, second capitaine et pilote du navire _Le\r\nPrince de Soubise_, du dit port, qui étoit détenu prisonnier à Waltham\r\nen Angleterre, d’où il s’est évadé, et qui, étant de retour à Dunkerque\r\nle 16ème Oct. 1757, y a été mis en prison par ordre du Roy.’\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring 1778, 1779, and six months of 1780, two hundred and ninety-five\r\nFrench prisoners alone had successfully escaped from parole places, the\r\ngreatest number being, from Alresford forty-five, Chippenham\r\nthirty-three, Tenterden thirty-two, Bandon twenty-two, Okehampton\r\nnineteen, and Ashburton eighteen.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 the following ratings were allowed to be on parole: 1. Taken on\r\nmen-of-war: Captain, lieutenant, ensign, surgeon, purser, chaplain,\r\nmaster, pilot, midshipman, surgeon’s mate, boatswain, gunner, carpenter,\r\nmaster-caulker, master-sail-maker, coasting pilot, and gentleman\r\nvolunteer.\r\n\r\n2. Taken on board a privateer or merchantman: Captain, passenger of\r\nrank, second captain, chief of prizes, two lieutenants for every hundred\r\nmen, pilot, surgeon, and chaplain.\r\n\r\nNo parole was to be granted to officers of any privateer under eighty\r\ntons burthen, or having less than fourteen carriage guns, which were not\r\nto be less than four-pounders.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 parole was granted as follows:\r\n\r\n1. All commissioned officers of the Army down to sous-lieutenant.\r\n\r\n2. All commissioned officers of the Navy down to gardes-marine\r\n(midshipmen).\r\n\r\n3. Three officers of privateers of a hundred men, but not under fourteen\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n4. Captains and next officers of merchant ships above fifty tons.\r\n\r\nThe parole form in 1797 was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘By the Commissioners for conducting H.M’s. Transport Service, and for\r\nthe care and custody of Prisoners of War.\r\n\r\n‘These are to certify to all H.M’s. officers, civil and military, and to\r\nwhom else it may concern, that the bearer ... as described on the back\r\nhereof is a detained (French, American, Spanish or Dutch) prisoner of\r\nwar at ... and that he has liberty to walk on the great turnpike road\r\nwithin the distance of one mile from the extremities of the town, but\r\nthat he must not go into any field or cross road, nor be absent from his\r\nlodging after 5 o’clock in the afternoon during the six winter months,\r\nviz. from October 1st to March 31st, nor after 8 o’clock during the\r\nsummer months. Wherefore you and everyone of you [_sic_] are hereby\r\ndesired and required to suffer him, the said ... to pass and repass\r\naccordingly without any hindrance or molestation whatever, he keeping\r\nwithin the said limits and behaving according to law.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form of parole to be signed by the prisoner was this:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Whereas the Commissioners for conducting H.M’s. Transport service and\r\nfor the care and custody of French officers and sailors detained in\r\nEngland have been pleased to grant ... leave to reside in ... upon\r\ncondition that he gives his parole of honour not to withdraw one mile\r\nfrom the boundaries prescribed there without leave for that purpose from\r\nthe said Commissioners, that he will behave himself decently and with\r\ndue regard to the laws of the kingdom, and also that he will not\r\ndirectly or indirectly hold any correspondence with France during his\r\ncontinuance in England, but by such letter or letters as shall be shown\r\nto the Agent of the said Commissioners under whose care he is or may be\r\nin order to their being read and approved by the Superiors, he does\r\nhereby declare that having given his parole he will keep it inviolably.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all parole towns and villages the following notice was posted up in\r\nprominent positions:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Notice is hereby given,\r\n\r\n‘That all such prisoners are permitted to walk or ride on the great\r\nturnpike road within the distance of one mile from the extreme parts of\r\nthe town (not beyond the bounds of the Parish) and that if they shall\r\nexceed such limits or go into any field or cross-road they may be taken\r\nup and sent to prison, and a reward of Ten Shillings will be paid by the\r\nAgent for apprehending them. And further, that such prisoners are to be\r\nin their lodgings by 5 o’clock in the winter, and 8 in the summer\r\nmonths, and if they stay out later they are liable to be taken up and\r\nsent to the Agent for such misconduct. And to prevent the prisoners from\r\nbehaving in an improper manner to the inhabitants of the town, or\r\ncreating any riots or disturbances either with them or among themselves,\r\nnotice is also given that the Commissioners will cause, upon information\r\nbeing given to their Agents, any prisoners who shall so misbehave to be\r\ncommitted to prison. And such of the inhabitants who shall insult or\r\nabuse any of the Prisoners of War on parole, or shall be found in any\r\nrespect aiding or assisting in the escape of such prisoners shall be\r\npunished according to law.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rewards offered for the conviction of prisoners for the violation of\r\nany of the conditions of their parole, and particularly for recapturing\r\nescaped prisoners and for the conviction of aiders in escape, were\r\nliberal enough to tempt the ragamuffins of the parole places to do their\r\nutmost to get the prisoners to break the law, and we shall see how this\r\nled to a system of persecution which possibly provoked many a foreign\r\nofficer, perfectly honourable in other respects, to break his parole. I\r\ndo not attempt to defend the far too general laxity of principle which\r\nmade some of the most distinguished of our prisoners break their\r\nsolemnly pledged words by escaping or trying to escape, but I do believe\r\nthat the continual dangling before unlettered clowns and idle town\r\nloafers rewards varying from ten guineas for recapturing an escaped\r\nprisoner to ten shillings for arresting an officer out of his lodging a\r\nfew minutes after bell ringing, or straying a few yards off the great\r\nturnpike, was putting a premium upon a despicable system of spying and\r\ntrapping which could not have given a pleasurable zest to a life of\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the rules about the correspondence of prisoners on parole\r\nwere strict, and no other rules seem to have been more irksome to\r\nprisoners, or more frequently violated by them. All letters for\r\nprisoners on parole had to pass through the Transport Office.\r\nRemittances had to be made through the local agent, if for an even sum\r\nin the Bank of England notes, if for odd shillings and pence by postal\r\norders. It is, however, very certain that a vast amount of\r\ncorrespondence passed to and from the prisoners independently of the\r\nTransport Office, and that the conveyance and receipt of such\r\ncorrespondence became as distinctly a surreptitious trade called into\r\nexistence by circumstances as that of aiding prisoners to escape.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1813 the money allowance to officers on parole above and\r\nincluding the rank of captain was ten shillings and sixpence per week\r\nper man, and below that rank eight shillings and ninepence. In that\r\nyear, complaints were made to the British Government by M. Rivière, that\r\nas it could be shown that living in England was very much more expensive\r\nthan in France, this allowance should be increased. Our Government\r\nadmitted the justice of the claim, and the allowances were accordingly\r\nincreased to fourteen shillings, and eleven shillings and eightpence. It\r\nmay be noted, by the way, that this was the same Rivière who in 1804 had\r\ndenied our right to inquire into the condition of British prisoners in\r\nFrance, curtly saying: ‘It is the will of the Emperor!’\r\n\r\nThe cost of burying the poor fellows who died in captivity, although\r\nborne by the State, was kept down to the most economical limits, for we\r\nfind two orders, dated respectively 1805 and 1812, that the cost was not\r\nto exceed £2 2_s._, that plain elm coffins were to be used, and that the\r\nexpense of gloves and hat-bands must be borne by the prisoners. Mr.\r\nFarnell, the Agent at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, was called sharply to order for\r\na charge in his accounts of fourteen shillings for a hat-band!\r\n\r\nIn 1814 funerals at Portsmouth were cut down to half a guinea, but I\r\npresume this was for ordinary prisoners. The allowances for surgeons in\r\nparole places in 1806 were:\r\n\r\nFor cures when the attendance was for more than five days, six shillings\r\nand eightpence, when for less, half that sum. Bleeding was to be charged\r\nsixpence, and for drawing a tooth, one shilling. Serious sick cases were\r\nto be sent to a prison hospital, and no allowance for medicines or extra\r\nsubsistence was to be made.\r\n\r\nWe must not allow sentimental sympathy with officers and gentlemen on\r\nparole to blind our eyes to the fact constantly proved that it was\r\nnecessary to keep the strictest surveillance over them. Although, if we\r\nexcept their propensity to regard lightly their parole obligations,\r\ntheir conduct generally may be called good, among so many men there were\r\nnecessarily some very black sheep. At one time their behaviour in the\r\nparole towns was often so abominable as to render it necessary to place\r\nthem in smaller towns and villages.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 the Marquis of Buckingham wrote thus to Lord Grenville from\r\nWinchester (_Dropmore MSS._):\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have for the last week been much annoyed by a constant inundation of\r\nFrench prisoners who have been on their route from Portsmouth to\r\nBristol, and my officers who, during the long marches have had much of\r\ntheir conversation, all report that the language of the common men was,\r\nwith very few exceptions, equally insolent, especially upon the subject\r\nof monarchy. The orders which we received with them were so perfectly\r\nproper that we were enabled to maintain strict discipline among them,\r\nbut I am very anxious that you should come to some decisions about your\r\n_parole prisoners_ who are now nearly doubled at Alresford and\r\n(Bishop’s) Waltham, and are hourly more exceptionable in their language\r\nand in their communication with the country people. I am persuaded that\r\nsome very unpleasant consequences will arise if this practice is not\r\nchecked, and I do not know how it is to be done. Your own good heart\r\nwill make you feel for the French priests now at Winchester to whom\r\nthese people (230 at Alresford, 160 at Waltham) have openly avowed\r\nmassacre whenever the troops are removed.... Pray think over some\r\narrangement for sending your parole prisoners out of England, for they\r\ncertainly serve their country here better than they could do at sea or\r\nin France (so they say openly).’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authorities had to be constantly on their guard against deceptions\r\nof all kinds practised by the paroled prisoners, in addition to the\r\nfrequent breaches of parole by escape. Thus applications were made\r\nalmost daily by prisoners to be allowed either to exchange their places\r\nof residence for London, or to come to London temporarily ‘upon urgent\r\nprivate affairs’. At first these permissions were given when the\r\napplicants were men whose positions or reputations were deemed\r\nsufficient guarantees for honourable behaviour, but experience soon\r\ntaught the Transport Office that nobody was to be trusted, and so these\r\napplications, even when endorsed by Englishmen of position, were\r\ninvariably refused.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in 1809, the Office received a letter from one Brossage,\r\nan officer on parole at Launceston, asking that he might be removed to\r\nReading, as he was suffering from lung disease. The reply was that as a\r\nrule people suffering from lung disease in England were only too glad to\r\nbe able to go to Cornwall for alleviation or cure. The truth was that M.\r\nBrossage wanted to exchange the dullness of a Cornish town for the life\r\nand gaiety of Reading, which was a special parole town reserved for\r\nofficers of distinction.\r\n\r\nAnother trick which the authorities characterized as ‘an unjustifiable\r\nmeans of gaining liberty’, was to bribe an invalid on the roster for\r\nFrance to be allowed to personate him. Poor officers were as glad to\r\nsell their chance in this way, as were poor prisoners on hulks or in\r\nprisons.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 some officers at Lichfield obtained their release because of\r\n‘their humane conduct at the late fire at Mr. Lee’s house’. But so many\r\napplications for release on account of similar services at fires came in\r\nthat the Transport Office was suspicious, and refused them, ‘especially\r\nas the French Government does not reward British officers for similar\r\nservices.’\r\n\r\nIn the same year one Andoit got sent to Andover on parole in the name of\r\nanother man, whom no doubt he impersonated, although he had no right to\r\nbe paroled, and at once made use of the opportunity and escaped.\r\n\r\nMost touching were some of the letters from paroled officers praying to\r\nhave their places of parole changed, but when the Transport Office found\r\nout that these changes were almost invariably made so that old comrades\r\nand friends could meet together to plan and arrange escapes, rejection\r\nbecame the invariable fate of them. For some time many French officers\r\non parole had been permitted to add to their incomes by giving lessons\r\nin dancing, drawing, fencing, and singing in English families, and for\r\nthese purposes had special permits to go beyond the usual one mile\r\nlimit. But when in 1811, M. Faure applied to go some distance out of\r\nRedruth to teach French, and M. Ulliac asked to be allowed to exceed\r\nlimits at Ashby-de-la-Zouch to teach drawing, the authorities refused,\r\nand this despite the backing up of these requests by local gentry,\r\ngiving as their reason: ‘If complied with generally the prisoners would\r\nbecome dispersed over all parts of the country without any regular\r\ncontrol over their conduct.’ Prisoners were not even allowed to give\r\nlessons away from their lodgings out of parole hours.\r\n\r\nVery rarely, except in the cases of officers of more than ordinarily\r\ndistinguished position, were relaxations of parole rules permitted.\r\nGeneral Pillet at Bishop’s Waltham in 1808, had leave to go two miles\r\nbeyond the usual one mile limit two or three times a week, ‘to take the\r\nair.’ General Pageot at Ashbourne was given eight days’ leave to visit\r\nWooton Lodge in 1804, with the result related elsewhere (p. 414).\r\n\r\nIn 1808 General Brenier, on parole at Wantage, was allowed 3_s._ a day\r\n‘on account of the wound in his thigh’, so unusual a concession as to\r\ncause the Transport Office to describe it as ‘the greatest rate of\r\nallowance granted to any prisoner of war in this country under any\r\ncircumstances’. Later, however, some prisoners at Bath were made the\r\nsame allowance.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it seems harsh on the part of the Transport Office to\r\nrefuse permission for a prisoner at Welshpool to lodge with the\r\npostmistress of that place, but without doubt it had excellent reason to\r\nthink that for purposes of escape as well as for carrying on an\r\nunsuspected correspondence, the post-office would be the very place for\r\na prisoner to live at. Again, the forgery of documents was very\r\nextensively carried on by the prisoners, and in 1803 the parole agents\r\nwere advised:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘With respect to admitting prisoners of war at Parole we beg to observe\r\nthat we think it proper to adhere to a regulation which from frequent\r\nabuses we found it absolutely necessary to adopt last war; namely, that\r\nno blank form of parole certificates be sent to the agents at the\r\ndepots, but to transmit them to the Agents, properly filled up whenever\r\ntheir ranks shall have been ascertained at this office, from lists sent\r\nby the agents and from extracts from the _Rôle d’Équipage_ of each\r\nvessel captured.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, the reason for this was that blank parole forms had been\r\nobtained by bribery, had been filled up, and that all sorts of\r\nundesirable and dangerous rascals got scattered among the parole places.\r\n\r\nSo long back as 1763 a complaint came from Dover that the Duc de\r\nNivernois was in the habit of issuing passes to prisoners of war on\r\nparole in England to pass over to Calais and Boulogne as ordinary\r\ncivilians, and further inquiry brought out the fact that he was not the\r\nonly owner of a noble name who trafficked in documents which, if they do\r\nnot come under the category of forgeries, were at any rate false.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 a letter from France addressed to a prisoner on parole at\r\nTiverton was intercepted. It was found to contain a blank printed\r\ncertificate, sealed and signed by the Danish vice-consul at Plymouth.\r\nOrders were at once issued that no more certificates from him were to be\r\nhonoured, and he was accused of the act. He protested innocence, and\r\nrequested that the matter should be examined, the results being that the\r\ndocuments were found to be forgeries.\r\n\r\nOf course, the parole agents, that is to say, the men chosen to guard\r\nand minister to the wants of the prisoners in the parole towns, occupied\r\nimportant and responsible positions. At first the only qualifications\r\nrequired were that they should not be shopkeepers, but men fitted by\r\ntheir position and their personality to deal with prisoners who were\r\nofficers, and therefore _ipso facto_, gentlemen. But during the later\r\nyears of the great wars they were chosen exclusively from naval\r\nlieutenants of not less than ten years’ standing, a change brought about\r\nby complaints from many towns and from many prisoners that the agents\r\nwere palpably underbred and tactless, and particularly perhaps by the\r\nrepresentation of Captain Moriarty, the agent at Valleyfield near\r\nEdinburgh, and later at Perth, that ‘the men chosen were attorneys and\r\nshopkeepers for whom the French officers have no respect, so that the\r\nlatter do just what they like’, urging that only Service men should\r\noccupy these posts.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the parole agent were to see that the prisoners under his\r\ncharge fulfilled all the obligations of their parole, to muster them\r\ntwice a week, to minister to their wants, to pay them their allowances,\r\nto act as their financial agents, to hear and adjust their complaints,\r\nto be, in fact, quite as much their guide, philosopher, and friend as\r\ntheir custodian. He had to keep a strict account of all receipts and\r\npayments, which he forwarded once a month to the Transport Office: he\r\nhad to keep a constant watch on the correspondence of the prisoners, not\r\nmerely seeing that they held and received none clandestinely, but that\r\nevery letter was to pass the examination of the Transport Office; and\r\nhis own correspondence was voluminous, for in the smallest parole places\r\nthere were at least eighty prisoners, whilst in the larger, the numbers\r\nwere close upon four hundred.\r\n\r\nFor all this the remuneration was 5 per cent. upon all disbursements for\r\nthe subsistence of the prisoners with allowances for stationery and\r\naffidavits, and it may be very naturally asked how men could be found\r\nwilling to do all this, in addition to their own callings, for such pay.\r\nThe only answer is that men were not only willing but anxious to become\r\nparole agents because of the ‘pickings’ derivable from the office,\r\nespecially in connexion with the collection and payment of remittances\r\nto prisoners. That these ‘pickings’ were considerable there can be no\r\ndoubt, particularly as they were available from so many sources, and as\r\nthe temptations were so many and so strong to accept presents for\r\nservices rendered, or, what was more frequent, for duty left undone.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, and making allowance for the character of the age and the\r\nnumberless temptations to which they were exposed, the agents of the\r\nparole towns seem to have done their hard and delicate work very fairly.\r\nNo doubt in the process of gathering in their ‘pickings’ there was some\r\nsharp practice by them, and a few instances are recorded of criminal\r\ntransactions, but a comparison between the treatment of French prisoners\r\non parole in England and the English _détenus_ in France certainly is\r\nnot to our discredit.\r\n\r\nThe Transport Office seems to have been unremitting in its watchfulness\r\non its agents, if we are to judge by the mass of correspondence which\r\npassed between the one and the others, and which deals so largely with\r\nminutiae and details that its consideration must have been by no means\r\nthe least heavy of the duties expected from these gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMr. Tribe, Parole Agent at Hambledon, seems to have irritated his\r\nsuperiors much by the character of his letters, for in 1804 he is told:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘As the person who writes your letters does not seem to know how to\r\nwrite English you must therefore in future write your own letters or\r\nemploy another to write them who can write intelligibly.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘If you cannot really write more intelligibly you must employ a person\r\nto manage your correspondence in future, but you are not to suppose that\r\nhe will be paid by us for his trouble.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSpettigue, Parole Agent at Launceston, got into serious trouble in 1807\r\nfor having charged commissions to prisoners upon moneys paid to them,\r\nand was ordered to refund them. He was the only parole agent who was\r\nproved to have so offended.\r\n\r\nSmith, Parole Agent at Thame, was rebuked in February, 1809, for having\r\ndescribed aloud a prisoner about to be conveyed from Thame to Portsmouth\r\nunder escort as a man of good character and a gentleman, the result\r\nbeing that the escort were put off their guard, and the prisoner\r\nescaped, Smith knowing all the time that the prisoner was the very\r\nreverse of his description, and that it was in consequence of his having\r\nobtained his parole by a ‘gross deception’, that he was being conveyed\r\nto the hulks at Portsmouth. However, Kermel, the prisoner, was\r\nrecaptured.\r\n\r\nEnchmarsh, Parole Agent at Tiverton, was reprimanded in July 1809 for\r\nhaving been concerned in the sale, by a prisoner, of a contraband\r\narticle, and was reminded that it was against rules for an agent to have\r\nany mercantile transactions with prisoners.\r\n\r\nLewis, Parole Agent at Reading, was removed in June 1812, because when\r\nthe dépôt doctor made his periodical round in order to select invalids\r\nto be sent to France, he tried to bribe Dr. Weir to pass General Joyeux,\r\na perfectly sound man, as an invalid and so procure his liberation.\r\n\r\nPowis, Parole Agent at Leek in Staffordshire, son of a neighbouring\r\nparson, was removed in the same year, having been accused of withholding\r\nmoneys due to prisoners, and continually failing to send in his\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Smith, the Agent at Thame, was blamed for having\r\nshown excessive zeal in his office by hiring people to hide and lie in\r\nwait to catch prisoners committing breaches of parole. Perhaps the\r\nTransport Office did not so much disapprove of his methods as un-English\r\nand mean, but they knew very well that the consequent fines and\r\nstoppages meant his emolument.\r\n\r\nThat parole agents found it as impossible to give satisfaction to\r\neverybody as do most people in authority is very clear from the\r\nfollowing episodes in the official life of Mr. Crapper, the Parole Agent\r\nat Wantage in 1809, who was a chemist by trade, and who seems to have\r\nbeen in ill odour all round. The episodes also illustrate the keen\r\nsympathy with which in some districts the French officers on parole were\r\nregarded.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the prisoners at Wantage, one Price, J.P., wrote of\r\nCrapper, that ‘being a low man himself, he assumes a power which I am\r\nsure is not to your wish, and which he is too ignorant to exercise’. It\r\nappears that two French officers, the generals Maurin and Lefebvre, had\r\ngone ten miles from Wantage—that is, nine miles beyond the parole\r\nlimit—to dine with Sir John Throckmorton. Crapper did his duty and\r\narrested the generals; they were leniently punished, as, instead of\r\nbeing sent to a prison or a hulk, they were simply marched off to\r\nWincanton. The magistrates refused to support Crapper, but, despite\r\nanother letter in favour of the generals by another J.P., Goodlake, who\r\nhad driven them in his carriage to Throckmorton’s house, and who\r\ndeclared that Crapper had a hatred for him on account of some\r\ndisagreement on the bench, the Transport Office defended their agent,\r\nand confirmed his action.\r\n\r\nFrom J. E. Lutwyche, Surveyor of Taxes, in whose house the French\r\ngenerals lodged, the Transport Office received the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n‘I beg leave to offer a few remarks respecting the French generals\r\nlately removed from Wantage. Generals Lefebvre and Maurin both lodged at\r\nmy house. The latter always conducted himself with the greatest\r\nPoliteness and Propriety, nor ever exceeded the limits or time\r\nprescribed by his parole until the arrival of General Lefebvre. Indeed\r\nhe was not noticed or invited anywhere till then, nor did he at all seem\r\nto wish it, his time being occupied in endeavouring to perfect himself\r\nin the English language. When General Lefebvre arrived, he, being an\r\nobject of curiosity and a man of considerable rank, was invited out, and\r\nof course General Maurin (who paid him great attention) with him, which\r\ncertainly otherwise would never have been the case. General Lefebvre has\r\ncertainly expressed himself as greatly dissatisfied with the way in\r\nwhich he had been taken, making use of the childish phrase of his being\r\nentrapped, and by his sullen manner and general conduct appeared as if\r\nhe was not much inclined to observe the terms of his parole.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother anti-Crapperist writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n‘I take this liberty in informing you that in case that the Prisoners of\r\nWar residing here on Parole be not kept to stricter orders, that they\r\nwill have the command of this Parish. They are out all hours of the\r\nnight, they do almost as they have a mind to do: if a man is loaded ever\r\nso hard, he must turn out of the road for them, and if any person says\r\nanything he is reprimanded for it.\r\n\r\n‘They have too much liberty a great deal.\r\n\r\n                           ‘I am, Gentlemen,\r\n                               ‘With a good wish to my King and Country,\r\n                                       ‘A TRUE ENGLISHMAN.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent asserted that although Mr. Crapper complained of\r\nthe generals’ breach of parole, he had the next week allowed thirty of\r\nthe French prisoners to give a ball and supper to the little tradesmen\r\nof the town, which had been kept up till 3 a.m.\r\n\r\nCrapper denied this, and said he had refused the application of the\r\nprisoners for a dance until 10 p.m., given at an inn to the ‘ladies of\r\nthe town—the checked apron Ladies of Wantage’.\r\n\r\nYet another writer declared that Crapper was a drunkard, and drank with\r\nthe prisoners. To this, Crapper replied that if they called on him as\r\ngentlemen, he was surely entitled to offer them hospitality. The same\r\nwriter spoke of the French prisoners being often drunk in the streets,\r\nof Crapper fighting with them at the inns, and accused him of\r\nwithholding money from them. Crapper, however, appears as Parole Agent\r\nfor Wantage, with 340 prisoners in his charge, some time after all this.\r\n\r\nI have given Crapper’s case at some length merely as an instance of what\r\nparole agents had to put up with, not as being unusual. Ponsford at\r\nMoreton-Hampstead, Smith at Thame, and Eborall at Lichfield, seem to\r\nhave been provoked in much the same way by turbulent and defiant\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nFor very palpable reasons the authorities did not encourage close\r\n_rapprochements_ between parole agents and the prisoners under their\r\ncharge. At Tavistock in 1779, something wrong in the intercourse between\r\nFord, the Agent, and his flock, had led to an order that not only should\r\nFord be removed, but that certain prisoners should be sent to\r\nLaunceston. Whereupon the said prisoners petitioned to be allowed to\r\nremain at Tavistock under Ford:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A qui nous sommes très sincèrement attachés, tant par les doux façons\r\nqu’il a scu toujours avoir pour nous, même en exécutant ses ordres, que\r\npar son honnêteté particulière et la bonne intelligence qu’il a soin de\r\nfaire raigner autant qu’il est possible entre les différentes claces de\r\npersonnes qui habitent cette ville et les prisonniers qu’y sont;—point\r\nsy essentiel et sy particulièrement bien ménagé jusqu’à ce jour.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one Tarade, a prisoner, writes describing Ford as a\r\n‘petit tyran d’Afrique’, and complains of him, evidently because he had\r\nrefused Tarade a passport for France. Tarade alludes to the petition\r\nabove quoted, and says that the subscribers to it belong to a class of\r\nprisoners who are better away. Another much-signed petition comes from\r\ndislikers of Ford who beg to be sent to Launceston, so we may presume\r\nfrom the action of the authorities in ordering Ford’s removal, that he\r\nwas not a disinterested dispenser and withholder of favours.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the agents seem generally to have been on very excellent\r\nterms with the prisoners in their charge, and some friendships were\r\nformed between captors and captives which did not cease with the release\r\nof the latter. Mr. Macbeth Forbes relates the following anecdote by way\r\nof illustration:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The late Mr. Romanes of Harryburn (whose father had been Agent at\r\nLauder) says about M. Espinasse, for long a distinguished French teacher\r\nin Edinburgh, who was for some time a parole prisoner at Lauder: “When I\r\nwas enrolled as a pupil with M. Espinasse some fifty years ago, he said:\r\n‘Ah! your fader had _me_!’ supplying the rest of the sentence by\r\nplanting the flat part of his right thumb into the palm of his left\r\nhand—‘Now I have _you_!’ repeating the operation. And when my father\r\ncalled to see M. Espinasse, he was quite put out by M. Espinasse seizing\r\nand hugging and embracing him, shouting excitedly: ‘Ah, mon Agent! mon\r\nAgent!’“’\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith at Kelso, Nixon at Hawick, Romanes at Lauder, and Bell at\r\nJedburgh, were all held in the highest esteem by the prisoners under\r\nthem, and received many testimonials of it.\r\n\r\nThe following were the Parole Towns between 1803 and 1813:\r\n\r\n Abergavenny.\r\n Alresford.\r\n Andover.\r\n Ashbourne.\r\n Ashburton.\r\n Ashby-de-la-Zouch.\r\n Biggar.\r\n Bishop’s Castle.\r\n Bishop’s Waltham.\r\n Brecon.\r\n Bridgnorth.\r\n Chesterfield.\r\n Chippenham.\r\n Crediton.\r\n Cupar.\r\n Dumfries.\r\n Hambledon.\r\n Hawick.\r\n Jedburgh.\r\n Kelso.\r\n Lanark.\r\n Lauder.\r\n Launceston.\r\n Leek.\r\n Lichfield.\r\n Llanfyllin.\r\n Lochmaben.\r\n Lockerbie.\r\n Melrose.\r\n Montgomery.\r\n Moreton-Hampstead.\r\n Newtown.\r\n Northampton.\r\n North Tawton.\r\n Odiham.\r\n Okehampton.\r\n Oswestry.\r\n Peebles.\r\n Peterborough.\r\n Reading.\r\n Sanquhar.\r\n Selkirk.\r\n South Molton.\r\n Tavistock.\r\n Thame.\r\n Tiverton.\r\n Wantage.\r\n Welshpool.\r\n Whitchurch.\r\n Wincanton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n                              PAROLE LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following descriptions of life in parole towns by French writers may\r\nnot be entirely satisfactory to the reader who naturally wishes to get\r\nas correct an impression of it as possible, inasmuch as they are from\r\nthe pens of men smarting under restrictions and perhaps a sense of\r\ninjustice, irritated by ennui, by the irksomeness of confinement in\r\nplaces which as a rule do not seem to have been selected because of\r\ntheir fitness to administer to the joys of life, and by the occasional\r\nevidences of being among unfriendly people. But I hope to balance this\r\nin later chapters by the story of the paroled officers as seen by the\r\ncaptors.\r\n\r\nThe original French I have translated literally, except when it has\r\nseemed to me that translation would involve a sacrifice of terseness or\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nListen to Lieutenant Gicquel des Touches, at Tiverton, after Trafalgar:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A pleasant little town, but which struck me as particularly monotonous\r\nafter the exciting life to which I was accustomed. My pay, reduced by\r\none-half, amounted to fifty francs a month, which had to satisfy all my\r\nneeds at a time when the continental blockade had caused a very sensible\r\nrise in the price of all commodities.... I took advantage of my leisure\r\nhours to overhaul and complete my education. Some of my comrades of more\r\nliterary bringing-up gave me lessons in literature and history, in\r\nreturn for which I taught them fencing, for which I always had much\r\naptitude, and which I had always practised a good deal. The population\r\nwas generally kindly disposed towards us; some of the inhabitants urging\r\ntheir interest in us so far as to propose to help me to escape, and\r\namong them a young and pretty _Miss_ who only made one condition—that I\r\nshould take her with me in my flight, and should marry her when we\r\nreached the Continent. It was not much trouble for me to resist these\r\ntemptations, but it was harder to tear myself away from the\r\nimportunities of some of my companions, who, not having the same ideas\r\nas I had about the sacredness of one’s word, would have forced me to\r\nescape with them.\r\n\r\n‘Several succeeded: I say nothing about them, but I have often been\r\nastonished later at the ill-will they have borne me for not having done\r\nas they did.’\r\n\r\n\r\nGicquel was at Tiverton six years and was then exchanged.\r\n\r\nA Freemasons’ Lodge, _Enfants de Mars_, was opened and worked at\r\nTiverton about 1810, of which the first and only master was Alexander de\r\nla Motte, afterwards Languages Master at Blundell’s School. The Masons\r\nmet in a room in Frog Street, now Castle Street, until, two of the\r\nofficers on parole in the town escaping, the authorities prohibited the\r\nmeetings. The Tyler of the Lodge, Rivron by name, remained in Tiverton\r\nafter peace was made, and for many years worked as a slipper-maker. He\r\nhad been an officer’s servant.\r\n\r\nThe next writer, the Baron de Bonnefoux, we have already met in the\r\nhulks. His reminiscences of parole life are among the most interesting I\r\nhave come across, and are perhaps the more so because he has a good deal\r\nof what is nice and kind to say of us.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in England in 1806, Bonnefoux was sent on parole to Thame\r\nin Oxfordshire. Here he occupied himself in learning English, Latin, and\r\ndrawing, and in practising fencing. In the Mauritius, Bonnefoux and his\r\nshipmates had become friendly with a wealthy Englishman settled there\r\nunder its French Government at l’Île de France. This gentleman came to\r\nThame, rented the best house there for a summer, and continually\r\nentertained the French officer prisoners. The Lupton family, of one son\r\nand two daughters, the two Stratford ladies, and others, were also kind\r\nto them, whilst a metropolitan spirit was infused into the little\r\nsociety by the visits of a Miss Sophia Bode from London, so that with\r\nall these pretty, amiable girls the Baron managed to pass his unlimited\r\nleisure very pleasantly. On the other hand, there was an element of the\r\npopulation of Thame which bore a traditional antipathy to Frenchmen\r\nwhich it lost no opportunity of exhibiting. It was a manufacturing\r\nsection, composed of outsiders, between whom and the natives an\r\nill-feeling had long existed, and it was not long before our Baron came\r\nto an issue with them. One of these men pushed against Bonnefoux as he\r\nwas walking in the town, and the Frenchman retaliated. Whereupon the\r\nEnglishman called on his friends, who responded. Bonnefoux, on his side,\r\ncalled up his comrades, and a regular _mêlée_, in which sticks, stones,\r\nand fists were freely used, ensued, the immediate issue of which is not\r\nreported. Bonnefoux brought his assailant up before Smith, the Agent,\r\nwho shuffled about the matter, and recommended the Baron to take it to\r\nOxford, he in reality being in fear of the roughs. Bonnefoux expressed\r\nhis disgust, Smith lost his temper, and raised his cane, in reply to\r\nwhich the Baron seized a poker. Bonnefoux complained to the Transport\r\nOffice, the result of which was that he was removed to Odiham in\r\nHampshire, after quite a touching farewell to his English friends and\r\nhis own countrymen, receiving a souvenir of a lock of hair from ‘la\r\njeune Miss Harriet Stratford aux beaux yeux bleus, au teint éblouissant,\r\nà la physionomie animée, à la taille divine’.\r\n\r\nThe populace of Odiham he found much pleasanter than that of Thame, and\r\nas the report of the part he had taken in the disturbance at Thame had\r\npreceded him, he was enthusiastically greeted. The French officers at\r\nOdiham did their best to pass the time pleasantly. They had a\r\nPhilharmonic Society, a Freemasons’ Lodge, and especially a theatre to\r\nwhich the local gentry resorted in great numbers, Shebbeare, the Agent,\r\nbeing a good fellow who did all in his power to soften the lot of those\r\nin his charge, and was not too strict a construer of the laws and\r\nregulations by which they were bound.\r\n\r\nBonnefoux made friends everywhere; he seems to have been a light-hearted\r\ngenial soul, and did not spare the ample private means he had in helping\r\nless fortunate fellow prisoners. For instance, a naval officer named Le\r\nForsiney became the father of an illegitimate child. By English law he\r\nhad to pay six hundred francs for the support of the child, or be\r\nimprisoned. Bonnefoux paid it for him.\r\n\r\nIn June 1807, an English friend, Danley, offered to take him to Windsor,\r\nquietly of course, as this meant a serious violation of parole rules.\r\nThey had a delightful trip: Bonnefoux saw the king, and generally\r\nenjoyed himself, and got back to Odiham safely. He said nothing about\r\nthis escapade until September, when he was talking of it to friends, and\r\nwas overheard by a certain widow, who, having been brought up in France,\r\nunderstood the language, as she sat at her window above. Now this widow\r\nhad a pretty nurse, Mary, to whom Bonnefoux was ‘attracted’, and\r\nhappening to find an unsigned letter addressed to Mary, in which was:\r\n‘To-morrow, I shall have the grief of not seeing you, but I shall see\r\nyour king,’ she resolved upon revenge. A short time after, there\r\nappeared in a newspaper a paragraph to the effect that a foreigner with\r\nsinister projects had dared to approach the king at Windsor. The widow\r\ndenounced Bonnefoux as the man alluded to: the Agent was obliged to\r\nexamine the matter, the whole business of the trip to Windsor came out,\r\nand although Danley took all the blame on himself, and tried to shield\r\nBonnefoux, the order came that the latter was at once to be removed to\r\nthe hulks at Chatham.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile a somewhat romantic little episode had happened at\r\nOdiham. Among the paroled prisoners there was a lieutenant (_Aspirant de\r\npremière classe_) named Rousseau, who had been taken in the fight\r\nbetween Admiral Duckworth and Admiral Leissegnes off San Domingo in\r\nFebruary, 1806. His mother, a widow, was dying of grief for him, and\r\nRousseau resolved to get to her, but would not break his parole by\r\nescaping from Odiham. So he wrote to the Transport Office that if he was\r\nnot arrested and put on board a prison ship within eight days, he would\r\nconsider his parole as cancelled, and would act accordingly, his\r\nresolution being to escape from any prison ship on which he was\r\nconfined, which he felt sure he could do, and so save his parole.\r\nAccordingly, he was arrested and sent to Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nBonnefoux, pending his removal to Chatham, was kept under guard at the\r\n_George_ in Odiham, but he managed to get out, hid for the night in a\r\nnew ditch, and early the next morning went to a prisoner’s lodging-house\r\nin the outskirts of Odiham, and remained there three days. Hither came\r\nSarah Cooper, daughter of a local pastry-cook, no doubt one of the\r\ndashing young sailor’s many _chères amies_. She had been informed of his\r\nwhereabouts by his friends, and told him she would conduct him to\r\nGuildford.\r\n\r\nThe weather was very wet, and Sarah was in her Sunday best, but said\r\nthat she did not mind the rain so long as she could see Bonnefoux. Says\r\nthe latter:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Je dis alors à Sara que je pensais qu’il pleuvrait pendant la nuit.\r\nElle répliqua que peu lui importait; enfin j’objectai cette longue\r\ncourse à pied, sa toilette et ses capotes blanches, car c’était un\r\ndimanche, et elle leva encore cette difficulté en prétendant qu’elle\r\navait du courage et que dès qu’elle avait appris qu’elle pouvait me\r\nsauver elle n’avait voulu ni perdre une minute pour venir me\r\nchercher. . . . Je n’avais plus un mot à dire, car pendant qu’elle\r\nm’entraînait d’une de ses petites mains elle me fermait gracieusement la\r\nbouche.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThey reached Guildford at daybreak, and two carriages were hired, one to\r\ntake Bonnefoux to London, the other to take Sarah back to Odiham. They\r\nparted with a tender farewell, Bonnefoux started, reached London safely,\r\nand put up at the Hôtel du Café de St. Paul.\r\n\r\nIn London he met a Dutchman named Vink, bound for Hamburg by the first\r\nvessel leaving, and bought his berth on the ship, but had to wait a\r\nmonth before anything sailed for Hamburg. He sailed, a fellow passenger\r\nbeing young Lord Onslow. At Gravesend, officers came on board on the\r\nsearch for Vink. Evidently Vink had betrayed him, for he could not\r\nsatisfactorily account for his presence on the ship in accordance with\r\nthe strict laws then in force about the embarkation of passengers for\r\nforeign ports; Bonnefoux was arrested, for two days was shut down in the\r\nawful hold of a police vessel, and was finally taken on board the\r\n_Bahama_ at Chatham, and there met Rousseau, who had escaped from the\r\nPortsmouth hulk but had been recaptured in mid-Channel.\r\n\r\nBonnefoux remained on the Chatham hulk until June 1809, when he was\r\nallowed to go on parole to Lichfield. With him went Dubreuil, the rough\r\nprivateer skipper whose acquaintance he made on the _Bahama_, and who\r\nwas released from the prison ship because he had treated Colonel and\r\nMrs. Campbell with kindness when he made them prisoners.\r\n\r\nDubreuil was so delighted with the change from the _Bahama_ to\r\nLichfield, that he celebrated it in a typical sailor fashion, giving a\r\nbanquet which lasted three days at the best hotel in Lichfield, and\r\nroared forth the praises of his friend Bonnefoux:\r\n\r\n                  De Bonnefoux nous sommes enchantés,\r\n                  Nous allons boire à sa santé!\r\n\r\nParole life at Lichfield he describes as charming. There was a nice,\r\nrefined local society, pleasant walks, cafés, concerts, réunions, and\r\nbilliards. Bonnefoux preferred to mix with the artisan class of\r\nLichfield society, admiring it the most in England, and regarding the\r\nmiddle class as too prejudiced and narrow, the upper class as too\r\nluxurious and proud. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Il est difficile de voir rien de plus agréable à l’œil que les réunions\r\ndes jeunes gens des deux sexes lois [_sic_] des foires et des marchés.’\r\n\r\n\r\nEborall, the Agent at Lichfield, the Baron calls a splendid chap: so far\r\nfrom binding them closely to their distance limit, he allowed the French\r\nofficers to go to Ashby-de-la-Zouch, to the races at Lichfield, and even\r\nto Birmingham. Catalini came to sing at Lichfield, and Bonnefoux went to\r\nhear her with Mary Aldrith, his landlord’s daughter, and pretty Nancy\r\nFairbrother.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Bonnefoux resolved to escape. There came on ‘business’ to\r\nLichfield, Robinson and Stevenson, two well-known smuggler\r\nescape-agents, and they made the Baron an offer which he accepted. He\r\nwrote, however, to the Transport Office, saying that his health demanded\r\nhis return to France, and engaging not to serve against England.\r\n\r\nWith another naval officer, Colles, he got away successfully by the aid\r\nof the smugglers and their agents, and reached Rye in Sussex. Between\r\nthem they paid the smugglers one hundred and fifty guineas. At Rye they\r\nfound another escaped prisoner in hiding, the Captain of the _Diomède_,\r\nand he added another fifty guineas. The latter was almost off his head,\r\nand nearly got them caught through his extraordinary behaviour. However,\r\non November 28, 1809, they reached Boulogne after a bad passage.\r\n\r\nRobinson with his two hundred guineas bought contraband goods in France\r\nand ran them over to England. Stevenson was not so lucky, for a little\r\nlater he was caught at Deal with an escaped prisoner, was fined five\r\nhundred guineas, and in default of payment was sent to Botany Bay.\r\n\r\nGeneral d’Henin was one of the French generals who were taken at San\r\nDomingo in 1803. He was sent on parole to Chesterfield in Derbyshire,\r\nand, unlike several other officers who shared his fate, was most popular\r\nwith the inhabitants through his pleasing address and manner. He married\r\nwhilst in Chesterfield a Scots lady of fortune, and for some years\r\nresided with her at Spital Lodge, the house of the Agent, Mr. Bower. He\r\nand Madame d’Henin returned to Paris in 1814, and he fought at Waterloo,\r\nwhere his leg was torn off by a cannon shot.\r\n\r\nHis residence in England seems to have made him somewhat of an\r\nAnglophile, for in Horne’s _History of Napoleon_ he is accused of\r\nfavouring the British at Waterloo, and it was actually reported to\r\nNapoleon by a dragoon that he ‘harangued the men to go over to the\r\nenemy’. This, it was stated, was just before the cannon shot struck him.\r\n\r\nFrom Chesterfield, d’Henin wrote to his friend General Boyer at\r\nMontgomery, under date October 30, 1804. After a long semi-religious\r\nsoliloquy, in which he laments his position but supposes it to be as\r\nPangloss says, that ‘all is for the best in this best of worlds’, he\r\nspeaks of his bad health, of his too short stay at ‘Harrowgate’ (from\r\nwhich health resort, by the way, he had been sent, for carrying on\r\ncorrespondence under a false name), of his religious conversion, and of\r\nhis abstemious habits, and finishes:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Rien de nouveau. Toujours la même vie, triste, maussade, ennuyeuse,\r\ndéplaisante et sans fin, quand finira-t-elle? Il fait ici un temps\r\nsuperbe, de la pluie, depuis le matin jusqu’au soir, et toujours de la\r\npluie, et du brouillard pour changer. Vie de soldat! Vie de chien!’\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the same, it is consoling to learn from the following letters\r\nwritten by French officers on parole to their friends, that compulsory\r\nexile in England was not always the intolerable punishment which so many\r\nauthors of reminiscences would have us believe. Here is one, for\r\ninstance, written from a prisoner on parole at Sevenoaks to a friend at\r\nTenterden, in 1757:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I beg you to receive my congratulations upon having been sent into a\r\ncountry so rich in pretty girls: you say they are unapproachable, but it\r\nmust be consoling to you to know that you possess the trick of winning\r\nthe most unresponsive hearts, and that one of your ordinary looks\r\nattracts the fair; and this assures me of your success in your secret\r\naffairs: it is much more difficult to conquer the middle-class sex....\r\nYour pale beauty has been very ill for some weeks, the reason being that\r\nshe has overheated herself dancing at a ball with all the Frenchmen with\r\nwhom she has been friendly for a certain time, which has got her into\r\ntrouble with her mother.... Roussel has been sent to the “Castle”\r\n(Sissinghurst) nine days ago, it is said for having loved too well the\r\nSevenoaks girls, and had two in hand which cost him five guineas, which\r\nhe had to pay before going. Will you let me know if the country is\r\nsuitable for you, how many French there are, and if food and lodgings\r\nare dear?\r\n\r\n              ‘To Mr. Guerdon. A French surgeon on parole at Tenterden.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next is from a former prisoner, then living at Dunkirk, to Mrs.\r\nMiller at the Post Office, Leicester, dated 1757. Note the spelling and\r\npunctuation:\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘MADAME,—\r\n\r\nVous ne scaurié croire quell plaisire j’ai de m’entretenir avec vous mon\r\ncœur ne peut s’acoutumer à vivre sans vous voire. Je nait pas encore\r\nrencontré notre chère compagnon de voyage. Ne m’oublié point, ma chère\r\nElizabeth vous pouvé estre persuadé du plaisire que j’auré en recevant\r\nde vos nouvelles. Le gros Loys se porte bien il doit vous écrire aussi\r\nqu’à Madame Covagne. Si vous voye Mrs. Nancy donne luy un baisé pour\r\nmoy’.\r\n\r\n\r\nA prisoner writes from Alresford to a friend in France:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I go often to the good Mrs. Smith’s. Miss Anna is at present here. She\r\nsent me a valentine yesterday. I go there sometimes to take tea where\r\nHenrietta and Betsi Wynne are. We played at cards, and spent the\r\npleasantest evening I have ever passed in England.’\r\n\r\n\r\nA Captain Quinquet, also at Alresford, thus writes to his sister at\r\nAvranches:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We pass the days gaily with the Johnsons, daughters and brother, and I\r\nam sure you are glad to hear that we are so happy. Come next Friday! Ah!\r\nIf that were possible, what a surprise! On that day we give a grand ball\r\nto celebrate the twenty-fifth wedding anniversary of papa and mamma.\r\nThere will be quite twenty people, and I flatter myself we shall enjoy\r\nourselves thoroughly, and if by chance on that day a packet of letters\r\nshould arrive from you—Mon Dieu! What joy!’\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adds, quite in the style of a settled local gossip, scraps of news,\r\nsuch as that Mrs. Jarvis has a daughter born; that poor Mr. Jack Smith\r\nis dead; that Colonel Lewis’s wife, a most amiable woman, will be at the\r\nball; that Miss Kimber is going to be married; that dear little Emma\r\nlearns to speak French astonishingly well; that Henrietta Davis is quite\r\ncured from her illness, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, plenty of evidence that the French officers found the\r\ndaughters of Albion very much to their liking. Many of them married and\r\nremained in England after peace was declared, leaving descendants who\r\nmay be found at this day, although in many cases the French names have\r\nbecome anglicized.\r\n\r\nIn Andover to-day the names of Jerome and Dugay tell of the paroled\r\nFrenchmen who were here between 1810 and 1815, whilst, also at Andover,\r\n‘Shepherd’ Burton is the grandson of Aubertin, a French prisoner.\r\n\r\nAt Chesterfield (Mr. Hawkesly Edmunds informs me), the names of Jacques\r\nand Presky still remain.\r\n\r\nRobins and Jacques and Etches are names which still existed in Ashbourne\r\nnot many years ago, their bearers being known to be descended from\r\nFrench prisoners there.\r\n\r\nAt Odiham, Alfred Jauréguiberry, second captain of the _Austerlitz_\r\nprivateer, married a Miss Chambers. His son, Admiral Jauréguiberry,\r\ndescribed as a man admirable in private as in public life, was in\r\ncommand of the French Squadron which came over to Portsmouth on the\r\noccasion of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee Naval Review in 1887, and he found\r\ntime to call upon an English relative.\r\n\r\nLouis Hettet, a prisoner on parole at Bishop’s Castle, Montgomeryshire,\r\nin 1814, married Mary Morgan. The baptism of a son, Louis, is recorded\r\nin the Bishop’s Castle register, March 6, 1815. The father left for\r\nFrance after the Peace of 1814; Mrs. Hettet declined to go, and died at\r\nBishop’s Castle not many years ago. The boy was sent for and went to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lucy Louisa Morris, who died at Oswestry in 1908, aged 83, was the\r\nsecond daughter of Lieutenant Paris, of the French Navy, a prisoner on\r\nparole at Oswestry.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 Thomas Benchin, descendant of a French prisoner at Oswestry,\r\ndied at Clun, in Shropshire, where his son is, or was lately, living.\r\nBenchin was famed for his skill in making toys and chip-wood ornaments.\r\n\r\nRobinot, a prisoner on parole at Montgomery, married, in June 1807, a\r\nMiss Andrews, of Buckingham.\r\n\r\nAt Wantage, in 1817, General de Gaja, formerly a prisoner on parole,\r\nmarried a grand-daughter of the first Duke of Leicester, and his\r\ndaughter married, in 1868, the Rev. Mr. Atkinson, vicar of East Hendred.\r\n\r\nAt Thame, François Robert Boudin married Miss Bone, by banns, in 1813;\r\nin the same year Jacques Ferrier married Mary Green by banns; Prévost de\r\nla Croix married Elizabeth Hill by licence; and in 1816 Louis-Amédée\r\nComte married Mary Simmons, also by licence. All the bridegrooms were or\r\nhad been prisoners on parole.\r\n\r\nIn the register of Leek I find that J. B. B. Delisle, Commandant of the\r\nport of Caen, married Harriet Sheldon; François Néan married Mary Lees,\r\ndaughter of the landlord of the _Duke of York_; Sergeant Paymaster\r\nPierre Magnier married Frances Smith, who died in 1874, aged 84; Joseph\r\nVattel, cook to General Brunet, married Sarah Pilsbury. Captains\r\nToufflet and Chouquet left sons who were living in Leek in 1880 and 1870\r\nrespectively, and Jean Mien, servant to General Brunet, was in Leek in\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nNotices of other marriages—at Wincanton, for instance—will be found\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAgainst those who married English girls and honourably kept to them,\r\nmust, however, be placed a long list of Frenchmen who, knowing well that\r\nin France such marriages were held invalid, married English women, and\r\nbasely deserted them on their own return to France, generally leaving\r\nthem with children and utterly destitute. The correspondence of the\r\nTransport Office is full of warnings to girls who have meditated\r\nmarriage with prisoners, but who have asked advice first. As to the\r\nsubsistence of wives and children of prisoners, the law was that if the\r\nlatter were not British subjects, their subsistence was paid by the\r\nBritish Government, otherwise they must seek Parish relief. In one of\r\nthe replies the Transport Office quotes the case of Madame Berton, an\r\nEnglishwoman who had married Colonel Berton, a prisoner on parole at\r\nChesterfield, and was permitted to follow her husband after his release\r\nand departure for France, but who, with a son of nineteen months old, on\r\narrival there, was driven back in great want and distress by the French\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the practice of the British Government in paying for\r\nthe subsistence of the French wives and children of prisoners of war, is\r\nthat of the French Government as described in the reply of the Transport\r\nOffice in 1813 to a Mrs. Cumming with a seven-year-old child, who\r\napplied to be allowed a passage to Morlaix in order to join her husband,\r\na prisoner on parole at Longwy:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Transport Office is willing to grant you a passage by Cartel to\r\nMorlaix, but would call your attention to the situation you will be\r\nplaced in, on your arrival in France, provided your husband has not by\r\nhis means or your own the power of maintaining you in France, as the\r\nFrench Government make no allowance whatever to wives and children\r\nbelonging to British prisoners of war, and this Government has no power\r\nto relieve their wants. Also to point out that Longwy is not an open\r\nParole Town like the Parole Towns in England, but is walled round, and\r\nthe prisoners are not allowed to proceed beyond the walls, so that any\r\nresources derivable from your own industry appears to be very\r\nuncertain.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Transport Office were constantly called upon to adjudicate upon such\r\nmatters as this:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In 1805, Colonel de Bercy, on parole at Thame, was “in difficulty”\r\nabout a girl being with child by him. The Office declined to interfere,\r\nbut said that if the Colonel could not give sufficient security that\r\nmother and child should not be a burden upon the rates, he must be\r\nimprisoned until he did.’\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a rule of the French Government, Englishwomen who had already lived\r\nin France with their husbands there as prisoners of war could not return\r\nto France if once they left it. This was brought about by some English\r\nofficers’ wives taking letters with them on their return from England,\r\nand, although as a matter of policy it could not be termed tyrannical,\r\nit was the cause naturally of much distress and even of calamity.\r\n\r\nThe next account of parole life in England is by Louis Garneray, the\r\nmarine painter, whose description of life on the hulks may be remembered\r\nas being the most vivid and exact of any I have given.\r\n\r\nAfter describing his rapture at release from the hulk at Portsmouth and\r\nhis joyous anticipation of comparative liberty ashore, Garneray says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘When I arrived in 1811 under escort at the little village (Bishop’s\r\nWaltham in Hampshire) which had been assigned to me as a place of\r\nresidence, I saw with some disillusion that more than 1,200 [_sic_]\r\nFrench of all ranks [_sic_] had for their accommodation nothing but some\r\nwretched, tumble-down houses which the English let to them at such an\r\nexorbitant price that a year’s rent meant the price of the house itself.\r\nAs for me, I managed to get for ten shillings a week, not a room, but\r\nthe right to place my bed in a hut where already five officers were.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow was up at five and dressed the next morning:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘What are you going to do?’ asked one of my room mates. ‘I’m going to\r\nbreathe the morning air and have a run in the fields,’ I replied.\r\n\r\n‘Look out, or you’ll be arrested.’\r\n\r\n‘Arrested! Why?’\r\n\r\n‘Because we are not allowed to leave the house before six o’clock.’\r\n\r\n\r\nGarneray soon learned about the hours of going out and coming in, about\r\nthe one-mile limit along the high road, that a native finding a prisoner\r\nbeyond the limit or off the main road had not only the right to knock\r\nhim down but to receive a guinea for doing so. He complained that the\r\nonly recreations were walking, painting, and reading, for the Government\r\nhad discovered that concerts, theatricals, and any performances which\r\nbrought the prisoners and the natives together encouraged familiarity\r\nbetween the two peoples and corrupted morals, and so forbade them.\r\nGarneray then described how he came to break his parole and to escape\r\nfrom Bishop’s Waltham.\r\n\r\nHe with two fellow-prisoner officers went out one hot morning with the\r\nintention of breakfasting at a farm about a mile along the high road.\r\nIntending to save a long bit they cut across by a field path. Garneray\r\nstumbled and hurt his foot and so got behind his companions. Suddenly,\r\nhearing a cry, he saw a countryman attack his friends with a bill-hook,\r\nwound one of them on the arm, and kill the other, who had begun to\r\nexpostulate with him, with two terrible cuts on the head. Garneray,\r\nseizing a stick, rushed up, and the peasant ran off, leaving him with\r\nthe two poor fellows, one dead and the other badly wounded. He then saw\r\nthe man returning at the head of a crowd of countrymen, armed with\r\npitchforks and guns, and made up his mind that his turn had come.\r\nHowever, he explained the situation, and had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthat the crowd sided with him against their brutal compatriot. They\r\nimprovised a litter and carried the two victims back to the cantonment,\r\nwhilst the murderer quietly returned to his work.\r\n\r\nWhen the extraordinary brutality of the attack and its unprovoked nature\r\nbecame known, such indignation was felt among the French officers in the\r\ncantonment that they drew up a remonstrance to the British Government,\r\nwith the translation of which into English Garneray was entrusted.\r\nWhilst engaged in this a rough-mannered stranger called on him and\r\nwarned him that he had best have nothing to do with the remonstrance.\r\n\r\nHe took the translated document to his brother officers, and on his way\r\nback a little English girl of twelve years quietly and mysteriously\r\nsigned to him to follow her. He did so to a wretched cottage, wherein\r\nlived the grandmother of the child. Garneray had been kind to the poor\r\nold woman and had painted the child’s portrait for nothing, and in\r\nreturn she warned him that the constables were going to arrest him.\r\nGarneray determined to escape.\r\n\r\nHe got away from Bishop’s Waltham and was fortunate enough to get an\r\ninside place in a night coach, the other places being occupied by an\r\nEnglish clergyman, his wife, and daughter. Miss Flora soon recognized\r\nhim as an escaped prisoner and came to his rescue when, at a halting\r\nplace, the coach was searched for a runaway from Bishop’s Waltham.\r\nEventually he reached Portsmouth, where he found a good English friend\r\nof his prison-ship days, and with him he stayed in hiding for nearly a\r\nyear, until April 1813.\r\n\r\nLonging to return to France, he joined with three recently-escaped\r\nFrench officers in an arrangement with smugglers—the usual\r\nintermediaries in these escapes—to take them there. To cut short a long\r\nstory of adventure and misadventure, such as we shall have in plenty\r\nwhen we come to that part of this section which deals with the escapes\r\nof paroled prisoners, Garneray and his companions at last embarked with\r\nthe smugglers at an agreed price of £10 each.\r\n\r\nThe smugglers turned out to be rascals; and a dispute with them about\r\nextra charges ended in a mid-Channel fight, during which one of the\r\nsmugglers was killed. Within sight of the French coast the British ship\r\n_Victory_ captured them, and once more Garneray found himself in the\r\n_cachot_ of the Portsmouth prison-ship _Vengeance_.\r\n\r\nGarneray was liberated by the Treaty of Paris in 1814, after nine years’\r\ncaptivity. He was then appointed Court Marine Painter to Louis XVIII,\r\nand received the medal of the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis d’Hautpol was taken prisoner at Arapiles, badly wounded, in\r\nJuly 1812, and with some four hundred other prisoners was landed at\r\nPortsmouth on December 12, and thence sent on parole to ‘Brigsnorth,\r\npetite ville de la Principauté de Galles’, clearly meant for Bridgnorth\r\nin Shropshire. Here, he says, were from _eight to nine hundred_ other\r\nprisoners, some of whom had been there eight or nine years, but\r\ncertainly he must have been mistaken, for at no parole place were ever\r\nmore than four hundred prisoners. The usual rules obtained here, and the\r\nallowance was the equivalent of one franc fifty centimes a day.\r\n\r\nWishing to employ his time profitably he engaged a fellow-prisoner to\r\nteach him English, to whom he promised a salary as soon as he should\r\nreceive his remittances. A letter from his brother-in-law told him that\r\nhis sisters, believing him dead, as they had received no news from him,\r\nhad gone into mourning, and enclosed a draft for 4,000 francs, which\r\ncame through the bankers Perregaux of Paris and ‘Coutz’ of London. He\r\ncomplains bitterly of the sharp practices of the local Agent, who paid\r\nhim his 4,000 francs, but in paper money, which was at the time at a\r\ndiscount of twenty-five per cent, and who, upon his claiming the\r\ndifference, ‘me répondit fort insolemment que le papier anglais valait\r\nautant que l’or français, et que si je me permettais d’attaquer encore\r\nle crédit de la banque, il me ferait conduire aux pontons’. So he had to\r\naccept the situation.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis, as we shall see, was not the man to invent such an\r\naccusation, so it may be believed that the complaints so often made\r\nabout the unfair practice of the British Government, in the matter of\r\nmoneys due to prisoners, were not without foundation. The threat of the\r\nAgent to send the Marquis to the hulks if he persisted in claiming his\r\ndues, may have been but a threat, but it sounds as if these gentlemen\r\nwere invested with very great powers. The Marquis and a fellow prisoner,\r\nDechevrières, adjutant of the 59th, messed together, modestly, but\r\nbetter than the other poorer men, who clubbed together and bought an ox\r\nhead, with which they made soup and ate with potatoes.\r\n\r\nA cousin of the Marquis, the Comtesse de Béon, knew a Miss Vernon, one\r\nof the Queen’s ladies of honour, and she introduced the Marquis to Lord\r\n‘Malville’, whose seat was near Bridgnorth, and who invited him to the\r\nhouse. I give d’Hautpol’s impression in his own words:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ce lord était poli, mais, comme tous les Anglais, ennemi mortel de la\r\nFrance. J’étais humilié de ses prévenances qui sentaient la protection.\r\nJe revins cependant une seconde fois chez lui; il y avait ce jour-là\r\nnombreuse compagnie; plusieurs officiers anglais s’y trouvaient. Sans\r\négards pour ma position et avec une certaine affectation, ils se mirent\r\nà déblatérer en français contre l’Empereur et l’armée. Je me levai de\r\ntable indigné, et demandai à Lord Malville la permission de me retirer;\r\nil s’efforce de me retenir en blâmant ses compatriotes, mais je\r\npersistai. Je n’acceptai plus d’invitations chez lui.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAll good news from the seat of war, says the Marquis, was carefully\r\nhidden from the prisoners, so that they heard nothing about Lützen,\r\nBautzen, and Dresden. But the news of Leipsic was loudly proclaimed. The\r\nprisoners could not go out of doors without being insulted. One day the\r\npeople dressed up a figure to represent Bonaparte, put it on a donkey,\r\nand paraded the town with it. Under the windows of the lodging of\r\nGeneral Veiland, who had been taken at Badajos, of which place he was\r\ngovernor, they rigged up a gibbet, hung the figure on it, and afterwards\r\nburned it.\r\n\r\nAt one time a general uprising of the prisoners of war in England was\r\nseriously discussed. There were in Britain 5,000 officers on parole, and\r\n60,000 men on the hulks and in prisons. The idea was to disarm the\r\nguards all at once, to join forces at a given point, to march on\r\nPlymouth, liberate the men on the hulks, and thence go to Portsmouth and\r\ndo the same there. But the authorities became suspicious, the generals\r\nwere separated from the other officers, and many were sent to distant\r\ncantonments. The Marquis says that there were 1,500 at Bridgnorth, and\r\nthat half of these were sent to Oswestry. This was in November, 1813.\r\n\r\nSo to Oswestry d’Hautpol was sent. From Oswestry during his stay escaped\r\nthree famous St. Malo privateer captains. After a terrible journey of\r\nrisks and privations they reached the coast—he does not say where—and\r\noff it they saw at anchor a trading vessel of which nearly all the crew\r\nhad come ashore. In the night the prisoners swam out, with knives in\r\ntheir mouths, and boarded the brig. They found a sailor sleeping on\r\ndeck; him they stabbed, and also another who was in the cabin. They\r\nspared the cabin boy, who showed them the captain’s trunks, with the\r\ncontents of which they dressed themselves. Then they cut the cable,\r\nhoisted sail and made off—all within gunshot of a man-of-war. They\r\nreached Morlaix in safety, although pursued for some distance by a\r\nman-of-war. The brig was a valuable prize, for she had just come from\r\nthe West Indies, and was richly laden. This the Frenchmen at Oswestry\r\nlearned from the English newspapers, and they celebrated the exploit\r\nboisterously.\r\n\r\nJust after this the Marquis received a letter from Miss Vernon, in which\r\nshe said that if he chose to join the good Frenchmen who were praying\r\nfor restoration of the Bourbons, she would get him a passport which\r\nwould enable him to join Louis XVIII at Hartwell. To this the Marquis\r\nreplied that he had been made prisoner under the tricolour, that he was\r\nstill in the Emperor’s service, and that for the moment he had no idea\r\nof changing his flag, adding that rather than do this he preferred to\r\nremain a prisoner. Miss Vernon did not write again on this topic until\r\nthe news came of the great events of 1814—the victories of the British\r\nat San Sebastian, Pampeluna, the Bidassoa, the Adur, Orthez and\r\nToulouse, when she wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I hope that now you have no more scruples; I send you a passport for\r\nLondon; come and see me, for I shall be delighted to renew our\r\nacquaintance.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHe accepted the offer, went to London, and found Miss Vernon lodged in\r\nSt. James’s Palace. Here she got apartments for him; he was fêted and\r\nlionized and taken to see the sights of London in a royal carriage. At\r\nWestminster Hall he was grieved to see the eagle of the 39th regiment,\r\ntaken during the retreat from Portugal, and that of the 101st, taken at\r\nArapiles. Then he returned to France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n                  THE PRISONERS ON PAROLE IN SCOTLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the great Scottish prisons at Perth, Valleyfield, and Edinburgh I\r\nhave dealt elsewhere, and it is with very particular pleasure that I\r\nshall now treat of the experiences of prisoners in the parole towns of\r\nScotland, for the reason that, almost without exception, our involuntary\r\nvisitors seem to have been treated with a kindness and forbearance not\r\ngenerally characteristic of the reception they had south of the Tweed,\r\nalthough of course there were exceptions.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, Sir Walter Scott took kindly notice of the foreigners\r\nquartered in his neighbourhood, but that he never lost sight of the fact\r\nthat they were foreigners and warriors is evident from the following\r\nletter to Lady Abercorn, dated May 3, 1812:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I am very apprehensive of the consequences of a scarcity at this\r\nmoment, especially from the multitude of French prisoners who are\r\nscattered through the small towns in this country; as I think, very\r\nimprovidently. As the peace of this county is intrusted to me, I thought\r\nit necessary to state to the Justice Clerk that the arms of the local\r\nmilitia were kept without any guard in a warehouse in Kelso; that there\r\nwas nothing to prevent the prisoners there, at Selkirk, and at Jedburgh,\r\nfrom joining any one night, and making themselves masters of this dépôt:\r\nthat the sheriffs of Roxburgh and Selkirk, in order to put down such a\r\ncommotion, could only command about three troops of yeomanry to be\r\ncollected from a great distance, and these were to attack about 500\r\ndisciplined men, who, in the event supposed, would be fully provided\r\nwith arms and ammunition, and might, if any alarm should occasion the\r\nsmall number of troops now at Berwick to be withdrawn, make themselves\r\nmasters of that sea-port, the fortifications of which, although ruinous,\r\nwould serve to defend them until cannon was brought against them.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scottish towns where prisoners of war on parole were quartered, of\r\nwhich I have been able to get information, are Cupar, Kelso, Selkirk,\r\nPeebles, Sanquhar, Dumfries, Melrose, Jedburgh, Hawick, and Lauder.\r\n\r\nBy the kind permission of Mrs. Keddie (‘Sarah Tytler’) I am able to give\r\nvery interesting extracts from her book, _Three Generations: The Story\r\nof a Middle-Class Scottish Family_, referring to the residence of the\r\nprisoners at Cupar, and the friendly intercourse between them and Mrs.\r\nKeddie’s grandfather, Mr. Henry Gibb, of Balass, Cupar.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Certainly the foreign officers were made curiously welcome in the\r\ncountry town, which their presence seemed to enliven rather than to\r\noffend. The strangers’ courageous endurance, their perennial\r\ncheerfulness, their ingenious devices to occupy their time and improve\r\nthe situation, aroused much friendly interest and amusement. The\r\nposition must have been rendered more bearable to the sufferers, and\r\nperhaps more respectable in the eyes of the spectators, from the fact,\r\nfor which I am not able to account, that, undoubtedly, the prisoners had\r\namong themselves, individually and collectively, considerable funds.\r\n\r\n‘The residents treated the jetsam and flotsam of war with more than\r\nforbearance, with genuine liberality and kindness, receiving them into\r\ntheir houses on cordial terms. Soon there was not a festivity in the\r\ntown at which the French prisoners were not permitted—nay, heartily\r\npressed to attend. How the complacent guests viewed those rejoicings in\r\nwhich the natives, as they frequently did, commemorated British\r\nvictories over the enemy is not on record.\r\n\r\n‘But there was no thought of war and its fierce passions among the youth\r\nof the company in the simple dinners, suppers, and carpet-dances in\r\nprivate houses. There were congratulations on the abundance of pleasant\r\npartners, and the assurance that no girl need now sit out a dance or\r\nlack an escort if her home was within a certain limited distance beyond\r\nwhich the prisoners were not at liberty to stray.\r\n\r\n‘I have heard my mother and a cousin of hers dwell on the courtesy and\r\nagreeableness of the outlanders—what good dancers, what excellent\r\ncompany, as the country girls’ escorts.... As was almost inevitable, the\r\nnatural result of such intimacy followed, whether or not it was\r\nacceptable to the open-hearted entertainers. Love and marriage ensued\r\nbetween the youngsters, the vanquished and the victors. A Colonel, who\r\nwas one of the band, married a daughter of the Episcopal clergyman in\r\nthe town, and I am aware of at least two more weddings which eventually\r\ntook place between the strangers and the inhabitants. (These occurred at\r\nthe end of the prisoners’ stay.)’\r\n\r\n\r\nBalass, where the Gibbs lived, was within parole limits. One day Gibb\r\nasked the whole lot of the prisoners to breakfast, and forgot to tell\r\nMrs. Gibb that he had done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Happily she was a woman endowed with tranquillity of temper, while the\r\nample resources of an old bountiful farmhouse were speedily brought to\r\nbear on the situation, dispensed as they were by the fair and capable\r\nhenchwomen who relieved the mistress of the house of the more arduous of\r\nher duties. There was no disappointment in store for the patient,\r\ningenious gentlemen who were wont to edify and divert their nominal\r\nenemy by making small excursions into the fields to snare larks for\r\ntheir private breakfast-tables.\r\n\r\n‘Another generous invitation of my grandfather’s ran a narrow risk of\r\nhaving a tragic end. Not all his sense of the obligation of a host nor\r\nhis compassion for the misfortunes of a gallant foe could at times\r\nrestrain race antagonism, and his intense mortification at any\r\noccurrence which would savour of national discomfiture. Once, in\r\nentertaining some of these foreign officers, among whom was a _maître\r\nd’armes_, Harry Gibb was foolish enough to propose a bout of fencing\r\nwith the expert. It goes without saying that within the first few\r\nminutes the yeoman’s sword was dexterously knocked out of his hand....\r\nEvery other consideration went down before the deadly insult. In less\r\ntime than it takes to tell the story the play became grim earnest. My\r\ngrandfather turned his fists on the other combatant, taken unawares and\r\nnot prepared for the attack, sprang like a wild-cat at his throat, and,\r\nif the bystanders had not interposed and separated the pair, murder\r\nmight have been committed under his own roof by the kindest-hearted man\r\nin the countryside.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThis increasing intimacy between the prisoners and the inhabitants\r\ndispleased the Government, and the crisis came when, in return for the\r\nkindness shown them, the prisoners determined to erect a theatre:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The French prisoners were suffered to play only once in their theatre,\r\nand then the rout came for them. Amidst loud and sincere lamentation\r\nfrom all concerned, the officers were summarily removed in a body, and\r\ndeposited in a town at some distance ... from their former guardians. As\r\na final _gage d’amitié_ ... the owners of the theatre left it a a gift\r\nto the town.’\r\n\r\n\r\nLater—in the ‘thirties—this theatre was annexed to the Grammar School to\r\nmake extra class-rooms, for it was an age when Scotland was opposed to\r\ntheatres.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               KELSO[14]\r\n\r\nFor some of the following notes, I am indebted to the late Mr. Macbeth\r\nForbes, who helped me notably elsewhere, and who kindly gave me\r\npermission to use them.\r\n\r\nSome of the prisoners on parole at Kelso were sailors, but the majority\r\nwere soldiers from Spain, Portugal, and the West Indies, and about\r\ntwenty Sicilians. The inhabitants gave them a warm welcome, hospitably\r\nentertained them, and in return the prisoners, many of whom were men of\r\nmeans, gave balls at the inns—the only establishments in these\r\npre-parish hall days where accommodation for large parties could be\r\nhad—at which they appeared gaily attired with wondrous frills to their\r\nshirts, and white stockings.\r\n\r\n‘The time of their stay’, says Mr. Forbes, ‘was the gayest that Kelso\r\nhad ever seen since fatal Flodden.’\r\n\r\nHere as elsewhere there were artists among them who painted miniatures\r\nand landscapes and gave lessons, plaiters of straw and manufacturers of\r\ncurious beautiful articles in coloured straw, wood-carvers, botanists,\r\nand fishermen. These last, it is said, first introduced the sport of\r\ncatching fish through holes in the ice in mid-winter. Billiards, also,\r\nare said to have been introduced into Scotland by the prisoners. They\r\nmostly did their own cooking, and it is noted that they spoiled some of\r\nthe landladies’ tables by chopping up frogs for fricassees. They bought\r\nup the old Kelso ‘theatre’, the occasional scene of action for wandering\r\nThespians, which was in a close off the Horse-Market, rebuilt and\r\ndecorated it, some of the latter work still being visible in the ceiling\r\nof the ironmongery store of to-day. One difficulty was the very scanty\r\ndressing accommodation, so the actors often dressed at home, and their\r\npassage therefrom to the theatre in all sorts of garbs was a grand\r\nopportunity for the gibes of the youth of Kelso. Kelso was nothing if\r\nnot ‘proper’, so that when upon one occasion the postmistress, a married\r\nwoman, was seen accompanying a fantastically arrayed prisoner-actor to\r\nthe theatre from his lodging, Mrs. Grundy had much to say for some time.\r\nOn special occasions, such as when the French play was patronized by a\r\nlocal grandee like the Duchess of Roxburgh, the streets were carpeted\r\nwith red cloth.\r\n\r\nBrément, a privateer officer, advertised: ‘Mr. Brément, Professor of\r\nBelles-Lettres and French Prisoner of War, respectfully informs the\r\nladies and gentlemen of Kelso that he teaches the French and Latin\r\nlanguages. Apply for terms at Mrs. Matheson’s, near the Market Place.’\r\nHe is said to have done well.\r\n\r\nMany of the privateersmen spoke English, as might be expected from their\r\nconstant intercourse with men and places in the Channel.\r\n\r\nOne prisoner here was suspected of being concerned with the manufacture\r\nof forged bank-notes, so rife at this time in Scotland, as he ordered of\r\nArchibald Rutherford, stationer, paper of a particular character of\r\nwhich he left a pattern.\r\n\r\nEscapes were not very frequent. On July 25, 1811, Surgeon-Major\r\nViolland, of the _Hebe_ corvette, escaped. So did Ensign Parnagan, of\r\nthe _Hautpol_ privateer, on August 5, and on 23rd of the same month\r\nLieutenant Rossignol got away. On November 11 one Bouchart escaped, and\r\nin June 1812 Lieutenant Anglade was missing, and a year later several\r\ngot off, assisted, it was said, by an American, who was arrested.\r\n\r\nIn November 1811 the removal of all ‘midshipmen’ to Valleyfield, which\r\nwas ordered at all Scottish parole towns, took place from Kelso.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Journeil, of the 27th Regiment, committed suicide in\r\nSeptember 1812 by swallowing sulphuric acid. He is said to have become\r\ninsane from home-sickness. He was buried at the Knowes, just outside the\r\nchurchyard, it being unconsecrated ground.\r\n\r\nA Captain Levasseur married an aunt of Sir George Harrison, M.P., a\r\nformer Provost of Edinburgh, and the Levasseurs still keep up\r\ncorrespondence with Scotland.\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 1814, the prisoners began to leave, and by the middle of June\r\nall had gone. The _Kelso Mail_ said that ‘their deportment had been\r\nuniformly conciliatory and respectable’.\r\n\r\nIn Fullarton’s _Imperial Gazetteer_ of Scotland we read that:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘From November 1810 to June 1814, Kelso was the abode of a body, never\r\nmore than 230 in number, of foreign prisoners of war, who, to a very\r\nnoticeable degree, inoculated the place with their fashionable follies,\r\nand even, in some instances tainted it with their laxity of morals.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother account says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Their stay here seems to have been quiet and happy, although one man\r\ncommitted suicide. They carried on the usual manufactures in wood and\r\nbone and basket work; gave performances in the local theatre, which was\r\ndecorated by them; were variously employed by local people, one man\r\ndevoting his time to the tracking and snaring of a rare bird which\r\narrived during severe weather.’\r\n\r\n\r\nRutherford’s _Southern Counties Register and Directory_ for 1866 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The older inhabitants of Kelso remember the French prisoners of war\r\nquartered here as possessed of many amiable qualities, of which “great\r\nmannerliness” and buoyancy of spirits, in many instances under the\r\ndepressing effects of great poverty, were the most conspicuous of their\r\npeculiarities; the most singular to the natives of Kelso was their habit\r\nof gathering for use different kinds of wild weeds by the road side, and\r\nhedge-roots, and killing small birds to eat—the latter a practise\r\nconsidered not much removed from cannibalism. That they were frivolous\r\nwe will admit, as many of them wore ear-rings, and one, a Pole, had a\r\nring to his nose; while all were boyishly fond of amusement, and were\r\nmerry, good-natured creatures.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOne memorable outbreak of these spirits is recorded in the _Kelso Mail_\r\nof January 30, 1812:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In consequence of certain riotous proceedings which took place in this\r\ntown near the East end of the Horn Market on Christmas last, by which\r\nthe peace of the neighbourhood was very much disturbed, an investigation\r\nof the circumstances took place before our respectable magistrate,\r\nBailie Smith. From this it appeared that several of the French prisoners\r\nof war here on parole had been dining together on Christmas Day, and\r\nthat a part of them were engaged in the riotous proceedings.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThese ‘riotous proceedings’ are said to have amounted to little more\r\nthan a more or less irregular arm-in-arm procession down the street to\r\nthe accompaniment of lively choruses. However, the Agent reported it to\r\nthe Transport Office, who ordered each prisoner to pay £1 1_s._ fine, to\r\nbe deducted from their allowance. The account winds up:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It is only an act of justice, however, to add that in so far as we have\r\nheard, the conduct of the French prisoners here on parole has been\r\nregular and inoffensive.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of St. Andrew in 1810, the Kelso Lodge of Freemasons\r\nwas favoured with a visit from several French officers, prisoners of\r\nwar, at present resident in the town. The Right Worshipful in addressing\r\nthem, expressed the wishes of himself and the Brethren to do everything\r\nin their power to promote the comfort and happiness of the exiles. After\r\nwhich he proposed the health of the Brethren who were strangers in a\r\nforeign land, which was drunk with enthusiastic applause.\r\n\r\nThere is frequent mention of their appearance at Masonic meetings, when\r\nthe ‘harmony was greatly increased by the polite manners and the vocal\r\npower of our French Brethren’.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many of their signatures on the parchment to which all\r\nstrangers had to subscribe their names by order of the Grand Lodge.[15]\r\n\r\nThe only war-prisoner relics in the museum are some swords.\r\n\r\nI have to thank Sir George Douglas for the following interesting letters\r\nfrom French prisoners in Kelso.\r\n\r\nThe first is in odd Latin, the second in fair English, the third in\r\nFrench. The two latter I am glad to give as additional testimonies to\r\nthe kindly treatment of the enforced exiles amongst us.\r\n\r\nThe first is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Kelso: die duodecima mensis Augusti anni 1811.\r\n\r\n‘Honorifice Praefecte:\r\n\r\n‘Monitum te facio, hoc mane, die duodecima mensis Augusti, hora decima\r\net semi, per vicum transeuntem vestimenta mea omnino malefacta fuisse\r\ncum aqua tam foetida ac mulier quae jactavit illam.\r\n\r\n‘Noxia mulier quae vestimenta mea, conceptis verbis, abluere noluit,\r\nculpam insulsitate cumulando, uxor est domino Wm.

In ista expectatione\r\ngratam habeas salutationem illius qui mancipio et nexo, honoratissime\r\npraefecte, tuus est.\r\n\r\n                                                               ‘MATRIEN.\r\n\r\n ‘Honorato, Honoratissimo Domino Smith,\r\n   ‘Captivorum Gallorum praefecto. Kelso.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gist of the above being that Mrs. Stuart threw dirty water over M.\r\nMatrien as he passed along the street in Kelso, and he demands her\r\npunishment and the cleansing of his clothes.\r\n\r\nThe second letter runs:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    ‘Paris, on the 6th day of May, 1817.\r\n\r\n ‘DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n‘I have since I left Kelso wrote many letters to my Scots friends, but I\r\nhave been unfortunate enough to receive no answer. The wandering life I\r\nhave led during four years is, without doubt, the cause of that silence,\r\nfor my friends have been so good to me that I cannot imagine they have\r\nentirely forgotten me. In all my letters my heart has endeavoured to\r\nprove how thankful I was, but my gratitude is of that kind that one may\r\nfeel but cannot express. Pray, my good Sir, if you remember yet your\r\nprisonner, be so kind as to let him have a few lignes from you and all\r\nnews about all his old good friends.\r\n\r\n‘The difficulty which I have to express myself in your tongue, and the\r\ncountryman of yours who is to take my letter, compel me to end sooner\r\nthan I wish, but if expressions want to my mouth, be assure in revange\r\nthat my heart shall always be full of all those feelings which you\r\ndeserve so rightly.\r\n\r\n‘Farewell, I wish you all kind of happiness.\r\n\r\n                                             ‘Your friend for ever,\r\n                                      ‘LE CHEVALIER LEBAS DE STE.

Their mile limits from the central point were, on the\r\nHawick road, to Knowes; over the bridge, as far as the Philiphaugh\r\nentries; and towards Bridgehead, the ‘Prisoners’ Bush’. An old man named\r\nDouglas, says Mr. Craig-Brown (from whose book on Selkirk, I take this\r\ninformation, and to whom I am indebted for much hospitality and his many\r\npains in acting as my mentor in Selkirk), remembered them coming to his\r\nfather’s tavern at Heathenlie for their morning rum, and astonishing the\r\npeople with what they ate. ‘They made tea out of dried whun blooms and\r\nskinned the verra paddas. The doctor anes was verra clever, and some of\r\nthem had plenty o’ siller.’\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 1811, the prisoners constructed a balloon, and sent it up\r\namidst such excitement as Selkirk rarely felt. Indeed, the Yeomanry then\r\nout for their training could not be mustered until they had seen the\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nA serious question came up in 1814 concerning the public burden which\r\nthe illegitimate children of these gentlemen were causing, and\r\ncomplaints were sent to the Transport Office, whose reply was that the\r\nfathers of the children were liable to the civil law, and that unless\r\nthey should provide for their maintenance, they should go to prison.\r\n\r\nTwo of the prisoners quarrelled about a girl and fought a bloodless duel\r\nat Linglee for half an hour, when the authorities appeared upon the\r\nscene and arrested the principals, who were sent to jail for a month.\r\n\r\nMr. J. John Vernon wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In an article upon the old Selkirk Subscription Library, reference is\r\nmade to the use of the Library by the officers who were confined in\r\nSelkirk and district during the Napoleonic wars.\r\n\r\n‘Historical reference is furnished incidentally in the pages of the Day\r\nBook—the register of volumes borrowed and returned. There is no mention\r\nof such a privilege being conferred by the members or committee, but, as\r\na matter of fact, all the French officers who were prisoners in Selkirk\r\nduring the Napoleonic wars were allowed to take books from the Library\r\nas freely and as often as they chose. Beginning with April 5th, 1811,\r\nand up to May 4th, 1814, there were no less than 132 closely written\r\nfoolscap pages devoted exclusively to their book-borrowing transactions.\r\nThey were omnivorous readers, with a _penchant_ for History and\r\nBiography, but devouring all sorts of literature from the poetical to\r\nthe statistical. Probably because the Librarian could not trust himself\r\nto spell them, the officers themselves entered their names, as well as\r\nthe names of books. Sometimes, when they made an entry for a comrade\r\nthey made blunders in spelling the other man’s name: that of Forsonney,\r\nfor instance, being given in four or five different ways. As the total\r\nnumber of prisoners was 94, it can be concluded from the list appended\r\nthat only two or three did not join the Library.\r\n\r\n‘Besides the French prisoners, the students attending Professor Lawson’s\r\nlectures seem to have had the privilege of reading, but for them all\r\nabout two pages suffice. It is said that, moved by a desire to bring\r\nthese benighted foreigners to belief in the true faith, Doctor Lawson\r\nadded French to the more ancient languages he was already proficient in,\r\nbut the aliens were nearly all men of education who knew their Voltaire,\r\nwith the result that the Professor made poor progress with his well\r\nmeant efforts at proselytism, if he did not even receive a shock to his\r\nown convictions.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were several Masonic Brethren among the foreign prisoners at\r\nSelkirk, and it is noteworthy that on March 9, 1812, it was proposed by\r\nthe Brethren of this Lodge that on account of the favour done by some of\r\nthe French Brethren, they should be enrolled as honorary members of the\r\nLodge, and this was unanimously agreed to.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the French Brethren were a numerous body,\r\ntwenty-three of their names being added to the roll of St. John’s; and\r\nwe find that, as at Melrose, they formed themselves into a separate\r\nLodge and initiated their fellow countrymen in their own tongue.\r\n\r\nIn what was known as Lang’s Barn, now subdivided into cottages, the\r\nFrench prisoners extemporized a theatre, and no doubt some of their\r\ndecorative work lies hidden beneath the whitewash. The barn was the\r\nproperty of the grandfather of the late Andrew Lang.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of Sous-lieutenant Doisy de Villargennes, of the 26th\r\nFrench line regiment, I shall now relate with particular pleasure, not\r\nonly on account of their unusual interest, but because they reflect the\r\nbrightest side of captivity in Britain. Doisy was wounded after Fuentes\r\nd’Oñoro in May 1811, and taken prisoner. He was moved to hospital at\r\nCelorico, where he formed a friendship with Captain Pattison, of the\r\n73rd. Thence he was sent to Fort Belem at Lisbon, which happened to be\r\ngarrisoned by the 26th British Regiment, a coincidence which at once\r\nprocured for him the friendship of its officers, who caused him to be\r\nlodged in their quarters, and to be treated rather as an honoured guest\r\nthan as a prisoner, but with one bad result—that the extraordinary good\r\nliving aggravated his healing wound, and he was obliged to return to\r\nhospital. These were days of heavy drinking, and Lisbon lay in the land\r\nof good and abundant wine; hosts and guest had alike fared meagrely and\r\nhardly for a long time, so that it is not difficult to account for the\r\neffect of the abrupt change upon poor Doisy. However, he pulled round,\r\nand embarked for Portsmouth, not on the ordinary prisoner transport, but\r\nas guest of Pattison on a war-ship. Doisy, with sixty other officers,\r\nwere landed at Gosport, and, contrary to the usual rule, allowed to be\r\non parole in the town previous to their dispatch to their\r\n_cautionnement_.\r\n\r\nAt the Gosport prison—Forton—whither he went to look up comrades, Doisy\r\nwas overjoyed to meet with his own foster-brother, whom he had persuaded\r\nto join his regiment, and whom he had given up as lost at Fuentes\r\nd’Oñoro, and he received permission to spend some time with him in the\r\nprison. I give with very great pleasure Doisy’s remarks upon captivity\r\nin England in general, and in its proper place under the heading of\r\nForton Prison (see pp. 217–18) will be found his description of that\r\nplace, which is equally pleasant reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I feel it my duty here, in the interests of truth and justice, to\r\ncombat an erroneous belief concerning the hard treatment of prisoners of\r\nwar in England.... No doubt, upon the hulks they led a very painful\r\nexistence; execrable feeding, little opportunity for exercise, and a\r\ndiscipline extremely severe, even perhaps cruel. Such was their fate.\r\nBut we must remember that only refractory prisoners were sent to the\r\nhulks.’\r\n\r\n\r\n(Here we must endorse a note of the editor of Doisy’s book, to the\r\neffect that this is inaccurate, inasmuch as there were 19,000 prisoners\r\nupon the hulks, and they could not all have been ‘refractory’.)\r\n\r\n\r\n‘These would upset the discipline of prisons like Gosport. Also we must\r\nremember that the inmates of the hulks were chiefly the crews of\r\nprivateers, and that privateering was not considered fair warfare by\r\nEngland.’ (Strange to say, the editor passes over this statement without\r\ncomment.) ‘At Forton there reigned the most perfect order, under a\r\ndiscipline severe but humane. We heard no sobbings of despair, we saw no\r\nunhappiness in the eyes of the inmates, but, on the contrary, on all\r\nsides resounded shouts of laughter, and the chorus of patriotic songs.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn after years, when Germain Lamy, the foster-brother, was living a free\r\nman in France, Doisy says that in conversation Lamy never alluded to the\r\nperiod of his captivity in England without praising warmly the integrity\r\nand the liberality of all the Englishmen with whom as a prisoner-trader\r\nhe had business relations. ‘Such testimonies,’ says Doisy, ‘and others\r\nof like character, cannot but weaken the feelings of hatred and\r\nantagonism roused by war between the two nations.’\r\n\r\nIn a few days Doisy was marched off to Odiham, but, on account of the\r\ncrowded state of the English parole towns, it was decided to send the\r\nnewcomers to Scotland, and so, on October 1, 1811, they landed at Leith,\r\n190 in number, and marched to Selkirk, via Edinburgh and the dépôt at\r\nPenicuik.\r\n\r\nThere was some difficulty at first in finding lodgings in the small\r\nScottish town for so large a number of strangers, but when it was\r\nrumoured that they were largely gentlemen of means and likely to spend\r\ntheir money freely, accommodation was quickly forthcoming.\r\n\r\nLiving in Scotland Doisy found to be very much cheaper than in England,\r\nand the weekly pay of half a guinea, regularly received through Coutts,\r\nhe found sufficient, if not ample. His lodging cost but half a crown a\r\nweek, and as the prisoners messed in groups, and, moreover, had no local\r\nhindrance to the excellent fishing in Ettrick and Tweed, board was\r\nprobably proportionately moderate. As the French prisoners in Selkirk\r\nspent upon an average £150 a week in the little town, and were there for\r\ntwo years and a half, no less a sum than £19,500 was poured into the\r\nlocal pocket.\r\n\r\nThe exiles started a French café in which was a billiard table brought\r\nfrom Edinburgh, to which none but Frenchmen were admitted; gathered\r\ntogether an orchestra of twenty-two and gave Saturday concerts, which\r\nwere extensively patronized by the inhabitants and the surrounding\r\ngentry; and with their own hands built a theatre accommodating 200\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Les costumes,’ said Doisy, ‘surtout ceux des rôles féminins, nous\r\nnécessitaient de grands efforts d’habilité. Aucun de nous n’avait\r\nauparavant exercé le métier de charpentier, tapissier, de tailleur,\r\nou . . . fait son apprentissage chez une couturière. L’intelligence,\r\ntoutefois, stimulée par la volonté, peut engendrer de petits miracles.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThey soon had a répertoire of popular tragedies and comedies, and gave a\r\nperformance every Wednesday.\r\n\r\nOn each of the four main roads leading out of the town there was at the\r\ndistance of a mile a notice-board on which was inscribed: ‘Limite des\r\nPrisonniers de Guerre.’ As evidence of the goodwill generally borne\r\ntowards the foreigners by the country folk, when a waggish prisoner\r\nmoved one of these boards a mile further on, no information was lodged\r\nabout it, and although a reward of one guinea was paid to anybody\r\narresting a prisoner beyond limits, or out of his lodgings at forbidden\r\nhours, it was very rarely claimed. Some of the prisoners indeed were\r\naccustomed daily to go fishing some miles down the rivers.\r\n\r\nThe French prisoners did not visit the Selkirk townsfolk, for the\r\n‘classy’ of the latter had come to the resolution not to associate with\r\nthem at all; but the priggish exclusiveness or narrow prejudice, or\r\nwhatever it might have been, was amply atoned for by the excellent\r\nfriendships formed in the surrounding neighbourhoods. There was Mr.\r\nAnderson, a gentleman farmer, who invited the Frenchmen to fish and\r\nregaled them in typical old-time Scots fashion afterwards; there was a\r\nrich retired lawyer, whose chief sorrow was that he could not keep sober\r\nduring his entertainment of them: there was Mr. Thorburn, another\r\ngentleman farmer, who introduced them to grilled sheep’s head,\r\nsalmagundi, and a cheese of his own making, of which he was particularly\r\nproud.\r\n\r\nBut above all there was the ‘shirra’, then Mr. Walter Scott, who took a\r\nfancy to a bright and lively young Frenchman, Tarnier by name, and often\r\ninvited him and two or three friends to Abbotsford—Doisy calls it\r\n‘Melrose Abbey’. This was in February 1812. Mrs. Scott, whom, Doisy\r\nsays, Scott had married in _Berlin_—was only seen some minutes before\r\ndinner, never at the repast itself. She spoke French perfectly, says\r\nDoisy. Scott, he says, was a very different man as host in his own house\r\nfrom what they judged him to be from his appearance in the streets of\r\nSelkirk. ‘Un homme enjoué, à la physionomie ordinaire et peu\r\nsignificative, à l’attitude même un peu gauche, à la démarche vulgaire\r\net aux allures à l’avenant, causées probablement par sa boiterie.’ But\r\nat Abbotsford his guests found him, on the contrary, a gentleman full of\r\ncordiality and gaiety, receiving his friends with amiability and\r\ndelicacy. The rooms at Abbotsford, says Doisy, were spacious and well\r\nlighted, and the table not sumptuous, but refined.\r\n\r\nDoisy tells us that what seemed to be the all-absorbing subject of\r\nconversation at the Abbotsford dinner-table was Bonaparte. No matter\r\ninto what other channel the talk drifted, their host would hark back to\r\nBonaparte, and never wearied of the anecdotes and details about him\r\nwhich the guests were able to give. Little did his informants think\r\nthat, ten years later, much that they told him would appear, as Doisy\r\nsays, in a distorted form rarely favourable to the great man, in Scott’s\r\n_Life of Bonaparte_. He quotes instances, and is at no pains to hide his\r\nresentment at what he considers a not very dignified or proper\r\nproceeding on the part of Sir Walter.\r\n\r\nOnly on one prominent occasion was the friendly feeling between the\r\nprisoners and the Selkirk people disturbed.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, 1813, the Frenchmen, in number ninety, united to celebrate\r\nthe Emperor’s birthday at their café, the windows of which opened on to\r\nthe public garden. They feasted, made speeches, drank numberless toasts,\r\nand sang numberless patriotic songs. As it was found that they had a\r\nsuperabundance of food, it was decided to distribute it among the crowd\r\nassembled in the public garden, but with the condition that every one\r\nwho accepted it should doff his hat and cry ‘Vive l’Empereur Napoléon!’\r\nBut although a couple of Frenchmen stood outside, each with a viand in\r\none hand and a glass of liquor in the other, not a Scotsman would comply\r\nwith the condition, and all went away. One man, a sort of factotum of\r\nthe Frenchmen, who made a considerable deal of money out of them in one\r\nway and another, and who was known as ‘Bang Bay’, from his habit, when\r\nperplexed with much questioning and ordering, of replying ‘by and by’,\r\ndid accept the food and drink, and utter the required cry, and his\r\nexample was followed by a few others, but the original refusers still\r\nheld aloof and gathered together in the garden, evidently in no\r\npeaceable mood.\r\n\r\nPresently, as the feast proceeded and the celebrants were listening to a\r\nsong composed for the occasion, a stone was thrown through the window,\r\nand hit Captain Gruffaud of the Artillery. He rushed out and demanded\r\nwho had thrown it. Seeing a young man grinning, Gruffaud accused him,\r\nand as the youth admitted it, Gruffaud let him have the stone full in\r\nthe face. A disturbance being at once imminent, the French officers\r\nbroke up chairs, &c., to arm themselves against an attack, and the\r\ncrowd, seeing this, dispersed. Soon after, the Agent, Robert Henderson,\r\nhurried up to say that the crowd had armed themselves and were\r\nre-assembling, and that as the Frenchmen were in the wrong, inasmuch as\r\nthey had exceeded their time-limit, nine o’clock, by an hour, he\r\ncounselled them to go home quietly. So the matter ended, and Doisy\r\nremarks that no evil resulted, and that Scots and French became better\r\ncomrades than ever.\r\n\r\nAnother event might have resulted in a disturbance. At the news of a\r\nvictory by Wellington in Spain, the Selkirk people set their bells\r\nringing, and probably rejoiced with some ostentation. A short time\r\nafter, says Doisy, came the news of a great French victory in Russia\r\n(?). The next day, Sunday, some French officers attended a Quakers’\r\nmeeting in their house, and managed to hide themselves. At midnight a\r\ndozen of their comrades were admitted through the window, bringing with\r\nthem a coil of rope which they made fast to that of the meeting-house\r\nbell, and rang vigorously, awakening the town and bringing an amazed\r\ncrowd to the place, and in the confusion the actors of the comedy\r\nescaped. Then came the Peace of 1814, and the Frenchmen were informed\r\nthat on April 20 a vessel would be at Berwick to take them to France.\r\nThe well-to-do among them proposed to travel by carriage to Berwick, but\r\nit was later decided that all funds should be united and that they\r\nshould go on foot, and to defray expenses £60 was collected. Before\r\nleaving, it was suggested that a considerable increase might be made to\r\ntheir exchequer if they put up to auction the structure of the theatre,\r\nas well as the properties and dresses, which had cost £120. Tarnier was\r\nchosen auctioneer, and the bidding was started at £50, but in spite of\r\nhis eloquence the highest bid was £40. So they decided to have some fun\r\nat the last. All the articles were carried to the field which the\r\nprisoners had hired for playing football, and a last effort was made to\r\nsell them. But the highest bid was only £2 more than before. Rather than\r\nsell at such a ridiculous price, the Frenchmen, armed with sticks and\r\nstones, formed a circle round the objects for sale, and set fire to\r\nthem, a glorious bonfire being the result.\r\n\r\nThe day of departure came. Most of the Frenchmen had passed the previous\r\nnight in the Public Garden, singing, and drinking toasts, so that all\r\nwere up betimes, and prepared for their tramp. Their delight and\r\nastonishment may be imagined when they beheld a defile of all sorts of\r\nvehicles, and even of saddle-horses, into the square, and learned that\r\nthese had been provided by the people of Selkirk to convey them to\r\nKelso, half way to Berwick.\r\n\r\nSays Doisy: ‘Nous nous séparâmes donc de nos amis de Selkirk sans garder\r\nd’une part et d’autre aucun des sentiments de rancune pouvant exister\r\nauparavant’.\r\n\r\nMr. Craig-Brown relates the following anecdote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Many years after the war, in the Southern States of America, two young\r\nSelkirk lads were astonished to see themselves looked at with evident\r\nearnestness by two foreigners within earshot of them. At last one of the\r\nlatter, a distinguished-looking elderly gentleman, came up and said:\r\n“Pardon, I think from your speech you come from Scotland?”\r\n\r\n‘“We do.”\r\n\r\n‘“Perhaps from the South of Scotland?”\r\n\r\n‘“Yes, from Selkirk.”\r\n\r\n‘“From Selkirk! Ah! I was certain: General! It is true. They are from\r\nSelkirk.” Upon which his companion came up, who, looking at one of the\r\nlads for a while, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n‘“I am sure you are the son of ze, ze, leetle fat man who kills ze\r\nsheep!”\r\n\r\n‘“Faith! Ye’re recht!” said the astonished Scot. “My father was Tudhope,\r\nthe flesher!”\r\n\r\n‘Upon which the more effusive of the officers fairly took him round the\r\nneck, and gave him a hearty embrace. Making themselves known as two of\r\nthe old French prisoners, they insisted on the lads remaining in their\r\ncompany, loaded them with kindness, and never tired of asking them\r\nquestions about their place of exile, and all its people, particularly\r\nthe sweethearts they and their comrades had left behind them.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PEEBLES\r\n\r\nAlthough Peebles was not established as a parole town until 1803, a\r\ngreat many French prisoners, not on parole, were here in 1798–9, most of\r\nthem belonging to the thirty-six-gun frigates _Coquille_ and _Résolue_,\r\nbelonging to the Brest squadron of the expedition to Ireland, which was\r\nbeaten by Sir John Warren. They were probably confined in the town jail.\r\n\r\nThe first parole prisoners were Dutch, Belgians, and Danes, ‘all of whom\r\ntook to learning cotton hand-loom weaving, and spent their leisure time\r\nin fishing’, says Mr. W. Chambers. In 1810 about one hundred French,\r\nPoles, and Italians came: ‘Gentlemanly in manner, they made for\r\nthemselves friends in the town and neighbourhood, those among them who\r\nwere surgeons occasionally assisting at a medical consultation. They set\r\nup a theatre in what is now the public reading-room, and acted Molière\r\nand Corneille. In 1811 all the “midshipmen” (gardes-marines) among them\r\nwere suddenly called to the Cross, and marched away to Valleyfield,\r\npossibly an act of reprisal for Bonaparte’s action against English\r\nmidshipmen.’[16]\r\n\r\nShortly after their removal, all the other prisoners were sent away from\r\nPeebles, chiefly to Sanquhar. This removal is _said_ to have been\r\nbrought about by the terror of a lady of rank in the neighbourhood at so\r\nmany enemies being near Neidpath Castle, where were deposited the arms\r\nof the Peeblesshire Militia.\r\n\r\nMr. Sanderson, of the Chambers Institute at Peebles, my indefatigable\r\nconductor about and around the pleasant old Border town, told me that\r\nthere is still in Peebles a family named Bonong, said to be descended\r\nfrom a French prisoner; that a Miss Wallink who went to Canada some\r\nyears ago as Mrs. Cranston, was descended from a Polish prisoner; that\r\nthere was recently a Mr. Lenoir at the Tontine Hotel (traditionally the\r\n‘hotle’ which was Meg Dodd’s bugbear in _St. Ronan’s Well_), and that a\r\ndrawing master named Chastelaine came of French prisoner parentage.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of the Chambers Institute are four excellent specimens of\r\nFrench prisoner-made ship models, and on the plaster walls of a house\r\nare a couple of poorly executed oil frescoes said to have been painted\r\nby prisoners.\r\n\r\nI have the kind permission of Messrs. Chambers to quote the following\r\nvery complete descriptions of French prisoner life at Peebles from the\r\n_Memoirs of William and Robert Chambers_ by Mr. William Chambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘1803. Not more than 20 or 30 of these foreign exiles arrived at this\r\nearly period. They were mostly Dutch and Walloons, with afterwards a few\r\nDanes. These men did not repine. They nearly all betook themselves to\r\nlearn some handicraft to eke out their scanty allowance. At leisure\r\nhours they might be seen fishing in long leather boots as if glad to\r\nprocure a few trout and eels. Two or three years later came a _détenu_\r\nof a different class. He was seemingly the captain of a ship from the\r\nFrench West Indies, who brought with him his wife and a negro\r\nservant-boy named Jack. Black Jack, as we called him, was sent to the\r\nschool, where he played with the other boys on the town green, and at\r\nlength spoke and read like a native. He was a good-natured creature, and\r\nbecame a general favourite. Jack was the first pure negro whom the boys\r\nat that time had ever seen.\r\n\r\n‘None of these classes of prisoner broke his parole, nor ever gave any\r\ntrouble to the authorities. They had not, indeed, any appearance of\r\nbeing prisoners, for they were practically free to live and ramble about\r\nwithin reasonable bounds where they liked.\r\n\r\n‘In 1810 there was a large accession to this original body of prisoners\r\non parole. As many as one hundred and eleven were already on their way\r\nto the town, and might be expected shortly. There was speedily a vast\r\nsensation in the place. The local Militia had been disbanded. Lodgings\r\nof all sorts were vacant. The new arrivals would on all hands be\r\nheartily welcomed. On Tuesday, the expected French prisoners in an\r\nunceremonious way began to drop in. As one of several boys, I went out\r\nto meet them coming from Edinburgh. They came walking in twos and\r\nthrees, a few of them lame. Their appearance was startling, for they\r\nwere in military garb in which they had been captured in Spain. Some\r\nwere in light blue hussar dress, braided, with marks of sabre wounds.\r\nOthers were in dark blue uniform. Several wore large cocked hats, but\r\nthe greater number had undress caps. All had a gentlemanly air,\r\nnotwithstanding their generally dishevelled attire, their soiled boots,\r\nand their visible marks of fatigue.\r\n\r\n‘Before night they had all arrived, and, through the activity of the\r\nAgent appointed by the Transport Board, they had been provided with\r\nlodgings suitable to their slender allowance. This large batch of\r\nprisoners on parole were, of course, all in the rank of naval or\r\nmilitary officers. Some had been pretty high in the service and seen a\r\ngood deal of fighting. Several were doctors, or, as they called\r\nthemselves, _officiers de santé_. Among the whole there were, I think,\r\nabout half a dozen midshipmen. A strange thing was their varied\r\nnationality. Though spoken of as French, there was in the party a\r\nmixture of Italians, Swiss, and Poles; but this we found out only after\r\nsome intercourse. Whatever their origin, they were warm adherents of\r\nNapoleon, whose glory at this time was at its height. Lively in manner,\r\ntheir minds were full of the recent struggle in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\n‘Through the consideration of an enterprising grocer, the prisoners were\r\nprovided with a billiard table at which they spent much of their time.\r\nSo far well. But how did these unfortunate exiles contrive to live? How\r\ndid they manage to feed and clothe themselves, and pay for lodgings? The\r\nallowance from Government was on a moderate scale. I doubt if it was\r\nmore than one shilling per head per diem. In various instances two\r\npersons lived in a single room, but even that cost half-a-crown per\r\nweek. The truth is they must have been half starved, but for the\r\nfortunate circumstance of a number of them having brought money—foreign\r\ngold-pieces, concealed about their persons, which stores were\r\nsupplemented by remittances from France; and in a friendly way, at least\r\nas regards the daily mess, or _table d’hôte_, the richer helped the\r\npoorer, which was a good trait in their character. The messing together\r\nwas the great resource, and took place in a house hired for the purpose,\r\nin which the cookery was conducted under the auspices of M. Lavoche, one\r\nof the prisoners who was skilled in _cuisine_. My brother and I had some\r\ndealings with Lavoche. We cultivated rabbits in a hutch built by\r\nourselves in the backyard, and sold them for the Frenchmen’s mess; the\r\nmoney we got for them, usually eighteenpence a pair, being employed in\r\nthe purchase of books.\r\n\r\n‘Billiards were indispensable, but something more was wanted. Without a\r\ntheatre, life was felt to be unendurable. But how was a theatre to be\r\nsecured? There was nothing of the kind in the place. The more eager of\r\nthe visitors managed to get out of the difficulty. There was an old and\r\ndisused ball-room. It was rather of confined dimensions, and low in the\r\nroof, with a gallery at one end, over the entrance, for the\r\nmusicians.... Walter Scott’s mother, when a girl, (I was told,) had\r\ncrossed Minchmoor, a dangerously high hill, in a chaise, from the\r\nadjacent country, to dance for a night in that little old ball-room. Now\r\nset aside as unfashionable, the room was at anybody’s service, and came\r\nquite handily for the Frenchmen. They fitted it up with a stage at the\r\ninner end, and cross benches to accommodate 120 persons, independently\r\nof perhaps 20 more in the musicians’ gallery. The thing was neatly got\r\nup with scenery painted by M. Walther and M. Ragulski, the latter a\r\nyoung Pole. No licence was required for the theatre, for it was\r\naltogether a private undertaking. Money was not taken at the door, and\r\nno tickets were sold. Admission was gained by complimentary billets\r\ndistributed chiefly among persons with whom the actors had established\r\nan intimacy.\r\n\r\n‘Among these favoured individuals was my father, who, carrying on a\r\nmercantile concern, occupied a prominent position. He felt a degree of\r\ncompassion for these foreigners, constrained to live in exile, and,\r\nbesides welcoming them to his house, gave them credit in articles of\r\ndrapery of which they stood in need; and through which circumstance they\r\nsoon assumed an improved appearance in costume. Introduced to the family\r\ncircle, their society was agreeable, and in a sense instructive. Though\r\nwith imperfect speech, a sort of half-English, half-French, they related\r\ninteresting circumstances in their careers.\r\n\r\n‘How performances in French should have had any general attraction may\r\nseem to require explanation. There had grown up in the town among young\r\npersons especially, a knowledge of familiar French phrases; so that what\r\nwas said, accompanied by appropriate gestures, was pretty well guessed\r\nat. But, as greatly contributing to remove difficulties, a worthy man,\r\nof an obliging turn and genial humour, volunteered to act as\r\ninterpreter. Moving in humble circumstances as hand-loom weaver, he had\r\nlet lodgings to a French captain and his wife, and from being for years\r\nin domestic intercourse with them, he became well acquainted with their\r\nlanguage. William Hunter, for such was his name, besides being of ready\r\nwit, partook of a lively musical genius. I have heard him sing _Malbrook\r\ns’en va t’en guerre_ with amazing correctness and vivacity. His services\r\nat the theatre were therefore of value to the natives in attendance.\r\nSeated conspicuously at the centre of what we may call the pit, eyes\r\nwere turned on him inquiringly when anything particularly funny was said\r\nrequiring explanation, and for general use he whisperingly communicated\r\nthe required interpretation. So, put up to the joke, the natives\r\nheartily joined in the laugh, though rather tardily.... As for the\r\nFrench plays, which were performed with perfect propriety, they were to\r\nus not only amusing but educational. The remembrance of these dramatic\r\nefforts of the French prisoners of war has been through life a continual\r\ntreat. It is curious for me to look back on the performances of the\r\npieces of Molière in circumstances so remarkable.\r\n\r\n‘My mother, even while lending her dresses and caps to enable performers\r\nto represent female characters, never liked the extraordinary intimacy\r\nwhich had been formed between the French officers and my father. Against\r\nhis giving them credit she constantly remonstrated in vain. It was a\r\ntempting but perilous trade. For a time, by the resources just\r\nmentioned, they paid wonderfully well. With such solid inducements, my\r\nfather confidingly gave extensive credit to these strangers—men who, by\r\ntheir positions, were not amenable to the civil law, and whose\r\nobligations, accordingly, were altogether debts of honour. The\r\nconsequence was that which might have been anticipated. An order\r\nsuddenly arrived from the Government commanding the whole of the\r\nprisoners to quit Peebles, and march chiefly to Sanquhar in\r\nDumfriesshire: the cause of the movement being the prospective arrival\r\nof a Militia Regiment.\r\n\r\n‘The intelligence came one Sunday night. What a gloom prevailed at\r\nseveral firesides that evening!\r\n\r\n‘On their departure the French prisoners made many fervid promises that,\r\nshould they ever return to their own country, they would have pleasure\r\nin discharging their debt. They all got home in the Peace of 1814, but\r\nnot one of them ever paid a farthing, and William Chambers was one of\r\nthe many whose affairs were brought to a crisis therefrom.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen later that this was not the uniform experience of\r\nBritish creditors with French debtors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n               PAROLE PRISONERS IN SCOTLAND (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SANQUHAR\r\n\r\nThe first prisoners came here in March 1812. They were chiefly some of\r\nthose who had been hurried away from Wincanton and other towns in the\r\nwest of England at the alarm that a general rising of war-prisoners in\r\nthose parts was imminent, and on account of the increasing number of\r\nescapes from those places; others were midshipmen from Peebles. In all\r\nfrom sixty to seventy prisoners were at Sanquhar. A letter from one of\r\nthe men removed from Peebles to Mr. Chambers of that town says that they\r\nwere extremely uncomfortable; such kind of people as the inhabitants had\r\nno room to spare; the greater part of the Frenchmen were lodged in barns\r\nand kitchens; they could get neither beef nor mutton, nothing but salted\r\nmeat and eggs. They applied to the Transport Office, in order to be\r\nremoved to Moffat.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners at Sanquhar left behind them, when discharged at the Peace\r\nof 1814, debts amounting to £160, but these were paid by the French\r\nCommissioners charged with effecting the final exchanges in that year.\r\n\r\nOne duel is recorded. It was fought on the Washing Green, and one of the\r\ncombatants was killed. Mr. Tom Wilson, in his _Memorials of Sanquhar\r\nKirkyard_, identifies the victim as Lieutenant Arnaud, whose grave bears\r\nthe inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In memory of J. B. Arnaud, aged 27 years, Lieutenant in the French\r\nNavy, prisoner of war on parole at Sanquhar. Erected by his companions\r\nin arms and fellow prisoners as a testimony of their esteem and\r\nattachment. He expired in the arms of friendship, 9th November, 1812.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been announced that he died of small-pox, but Mr. Wilson thinks\r\nthis was put out as a blind.\r\n\r\nSome changes of French names into English are to be noted here as\r\nelsewhere. Thus, Auguste Gregoire, cabin boy of the _Jeune Corneille_\r\nprivateer, captured in 1803, was confined at Peebles, and later at\r\nSanquhar. He married a Peebles girl, but as she absolutely refused to go\r\nwith him to France when Peace was declared in 1814 he was obliged to\r\nremain, and became a teacher of dancing and deportment under the name of\r\nAngus MacGregor. So also one Etienne Foulkes became Etney Fox; Baptiste\r\nbecame Baptie, and Walnet was turned into Walden.\r\n\r\nThere was a Masonic Lodge at Sanquhar—the ‘Paix Désirée’.\r\n\r\nThe banks of Crawick were a favourite resort of the prisoners, and on a\r\nrock in the Holme Walks is cut ‘Luego de Delizia 1812’, and to the\r\nright, between two lines, the word ‘Souvenir’. The old bathing place of\r\nthe prisoners, behind Holme House, is still known as ‘The Sodger’s\r\nPool’.\r\n\r\nHop-plants are said to have been introduced hereabouts by the\r\nprisoners—probably Germans.\r\n\r\nMr. James Brown thus writes about the prisoners at Sanquhar:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘They were Frenchmen, Italians and Poles—handsome young fellows, who had\r\nall the manners of gentlemen, and, living a life of enforced idleness,\r\nthey became great favourites with the ladies with whose hearts they\r\nplayed havoc, and, we regret to record, in some instances with their\r\nvirtue.’\r\n\r\n\r\n‘This’, says the Rev. Matthew Dickie, of the South United Free Church,\r\nSanquhar, ‘is only too true. John Wysilaski, who left Sanquhar when\r\nquite a youth and became a “settler” in Australia, was the illegitimate\r\nson of one of the officers. This John Wysilaski died between 25 and 30\r\nyears of age, and left a large fortune. Of this he bequeathed £60,000 to\r\nthe Presbyterian Church of Victoria, and over £4,000 to the church with\r\nwhich his mother had been connected, viz. the South Church, Sanquhar,\r\nand he directed the interest of this sum to be paid to the Minister of\r\nthe South Church over and above his stipend. The same Polish officer had\r\nanother son by another woman, Louis Wysilaski, who lived and died in his\r\nnative town. I remember him quite well.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DUMFRIES\r\n\r\nThe first detachment of officer-prisoners arrived at Dumfries in\r\nNovember 1811, from Peebles, whence they had marched the thirty-two\r\nmiles to Moffat, and had driven from there. The agent at Dumfries was\r\nMr. Francis Shortt, Town Clerk of the Burgh, and brother of Dr. Thomas\r\nShortt, who, as Physician to the British Forces at St. Helena, was to\r\nassist, ten years later, at the post-mortem examination of Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nAt first the prices asked by the inhabitants for lodgings somewhat\r\nastonished the prisoners, being from fifteen to twenty-five shillings a\r\nweek, but in the end they were moderately accommodated and better than\r\nin Peebles. Their impressions of Dumfries were certainly favourable, for\r\nnot only had they in Mr. Shortt a just and kindly Agent, but the\r\ntownsfolk and the country gentry offered them every sort of hospitality.\r\nIn a letter to Mr. Chambers of Peebles, one of them says: ‘The\r\ninhabitants, I think, are frightened with Frenchmen, and run after us to\r\nsee if we are like other people; the town is pretty enough, and the\r\ninhabitants, though curious, seem very gentle.’\r\n\r\nAnother, after a visit to the theatre, writes in English:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have been to the theatre of the town, and I was very satisfied with\r\nthe actors; they are very good for a little town like Dumfries, where\r\nreceipts are not very copious, though I would have very much pleasure\r\nwith going to the play-house now and then. However, I am deprived of it\r\nby the bell which rings at five o’clock, and if I am not in my lodging\r\nby the hour appointed by the law, I must at least avoid to be in the\r\npublic meeting, at which some inhabitants don’t like to see me.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was long before the natives could get used to certain peculiarities\r\nin the Frenchmen’s diet, particularly frogs. A noted Dumfries character,\r\nGeorge Hair, who died a few years ago, used to declare that ‘the first\r\nsiller he ever earned was for gatherin’ paddocks for the Frenchmen’, and\r\nan aged inmate of Lanark Poorhouse, who passed his early boyhood at\r\nDumfries, used to tell a funny frog story. He remembered that fifteen or\r\nsixteen prisoners used to live together in a big house, not far from his\r\nfather’s, and that there was a meadow near at hand where they got great\r\nstore of frogs. Once there was a Crispin procession at Dumfries, and a\r\nMr. Renwick towered above all the others as King.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Crispin ploy, ye ken, cam frae France, an’ the officers in the big\r\nhoose askit the King o’ the cobblers tae dine wi’ them. They had a gran’\r\nspread wi’ a fine pie, that Maister Renwick thocht was made o’ rabbits\r\ntoshed up in some new fangled way, an’ he didna miss tae lay in a guid\r\nstock. When a’ was owre, they askit him how he likit his denner, an’ he\r\nsaid “First rate”. Syne they lauched and speered him if he kent what the\r\npie was made o’, but he said he wasna sure. When they tell’t him it was\r\npaddocks, it was a’ ane as if they had gien him a dose of pizzen. He\r\njust banged up an’ breenged oot the hoose. Oor bit winnock lookit oot on\r\nthe Frenchmen’s backyaird, an’ we saw Maister Renwick sair, sair\r\nforfochen, but after a dainty bit warsle, he an’ the paddocks pairtit\r\ncompany.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that the French prisoners considered a good fat cat an\r\nexcellent substitute for a hare.\r\n\r\nAt a fire, two French surgeons who distinguished themselves in fighting\r\nit, were, on a petition from the inhabitants to the Transport Board,\r\nallowed to return immediately to France. But another surgeon who applied\r\nto be sent to Kelso as he had a relative there, was refused permission—a\r\nrefusal, which, it is quite possible, was really a compliment, for the\r\nrecords of parole life in Britain abound with evidence of the high\r\nestimation in which French prisoner-surgeons were held in our country\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nBetween thirty and forty officers tried to escape from Dumfries during\r\nthe three years of its being a Parole Town; most of these were\r\nrecaptured, and sent to Valleyfield Prison. Four officers took advantage\r\nof the fishing-licence usually extended to the officers on parole here,\r\nby which strict adherence to the mile limit was not insisted upon, and\r\ngradually got their belongings away to Lochmaben, eight miles distant,\r\nwhere were also parole prisoners. One of them actually wrote to the\r\nColonel of the Regiment stationed in Dumfries, apologizing for his\r\naction, explaining it, promising that he would get an English\r\nofficer-prisoner in France exchanged, and that he would not take up arms\r\nagainst her, and that he would repay all the civilities he had received\r\nin Scotland. But all were recaptured and sent to Valleyfield.\r\n\r\nAs instances of the strictness with which even a popular agent carried\r\nout his regulations, may be cited that of the officer here, who was sent\r\nto Valleyfield because he had written to a lady in Devonshire, enclosing\r\na letter to a friend of his. a prisoner on parole there, without first\r\nshowing it to the Agent. In justice to Mr. Shortt, however, it is right\r\nto say that had the letter been a harmless one, and not, as was\r\ngenerally the case, full of abuse of the Government and the country, so\r\nextreme a view would not have been taken of the breach. Another instance\r\nwas the refusal by the Agent of a request in 1812 from the officers to\r\ngive a concert. In this case he was under orders from the Transport\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nIn March 1812, a number of the prisoners had at their own request copies\r\nof the Scriptures supplied them in English, French, German, Italian, and\r\nSpanish.\r\n\r\nThat the French officers on parole in Britain politically arranged their\r\nallegiance to the Powers that were, is exemplified by the following\r\nincidents at Dumfries. On the re-establishment of the Bourbon Dynasty,\r\nthe following address was drawn up and sent to the French Commissioners\r\nfor the release of prisoners:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               ‘Dumfries, le 6 Mai 1814.\r\n\r\n‘Les officiers détenus sur parole donnent leur adhésion aux actes du\r\nGouvernement Français qui rappelle l’illustre sang des Bourbons, au\r\ntrône de ses ancêtres. Puissent les Français compter une longue suite de\r\nrois du sang de Saint Louis et de Henri IV, qui a toujours fait leur\r\ngloire et assuré leur bonheur! Vive Louis XVIII! Vivent les Bourbons!’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of the same month a French officer, seeing in the window of\r\na bookseller’s shop a ludicrous caricature of Bonaparte, went into the\r\nshop in a violent passion, bought two copies, and tore them in pieces\r\nbefore a crowd of people, uttering dreadful imprecations against those\r\nwho dared to insult ‘his Emperor’. The fact is that the army to a man\r\nwas Bonapartist at heart, as after events showed, but at Dumfries, as\r\nelsewhere, personal interests rendered it politic to assume loyalty and\r\ndevotion to the re-established Royalty. Most of the prisoners, however,\r\nwho elected to remain in Britain after the Declaration of Peace were\r\nunswerving Royalists. Lieutenant Guillemet at Dumfries was one of these.\r\nHe became a professor of French at Dumfries Academy and also gave\r\nlessons in fencing, and was a great favourite with his pupils and the\r\npublic. His son was for many years a chemist at Maxwelltown.\r\n\r\nThe average number of prisoners was about 100: they were mostly\r\nsoldiers, and not sailors, on account of the proximity of Dumfries to\r\nthe sea. I cannot refrain from adding to the frequent testimonies I have\r\nquoted as illustrating the good understanding which existed between\r\ncaptors and captives in Scotland, the following extract from a Farewell\r\nLetter which appeared in the _Dumfries Courier_, April 26, 1814,\r\ncontributed by Lieutenant De Montaignac of the ‘Parisian Guard’.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I should indeed be very ungrateful were I to leave this country without\r\npublicly expressing my gratitude to the inhabitants of Dumfries. From\r\nthe moment of my arrival in Scotland, the vexations indispensable in the\r\nsituation of a prisoner have disappeared before me. I have been two\r\nyears and five months in this town, prisoner on my parole of honour; and\r\nit is with the most lively emotion that I quit a place where I have\r\nfound so many alleviations to my melancholy situation. I must express my\r\nthanks to the generous proceedings with which I have been loaded by the\r\nmost part of the inhabitants of Dumfries during my captivity,\r\nproceedings which cannot but give an advantageous opinion of the\r\nScottish nation. I will add that the respectable magistrates of this\r\ntown have constantly given proofs of their generous dispositions to\r\nmitigate the situation of the prisoners; and that our worthy Agent, Mr.\r\nShortt, has always softened our lot by the delicate manner in which he\r\nfulfilled the duty of his functions. It is then with a remembrance full\r\nof gratitude, esteem, and consideration for the honest inhabitants of\r\nDumfries, that I quit the charming banks of the Nith to return to the\r\ncapital of France, my beloved country, from which I have been absent\r\nseven years.’\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the following romantic incidents I am indebted to Mr. William\r\nMcDowell’s _Memorials of St. Michael’s, Dumfries_.\r\n\r\nPolly Stewart, the object of one of Burns’s minor poems, married a\r\nDumfries prisoner of war. She lived at Maxwelltown, and her father was a\r\nclose friend of Burns. A handsome young Swiss prisoner, Fleitz by name,\r\nloved her and married her, and when Louis XVIII came to the French\r\nthrone, he, being in the Swiss Guard, took her to France. When Louis\r\nPhilippe became king, the Swiss body-guard was disbanded, and Mr. and\r\nMrs. Fleitz went to Switzerland. It is said that poor Polly had an\r\nunhappy married life, but at any rate nothing was heard of her for\r\nthirty years, when she returned to Scotland, and not long after her\r\nhusband died and she went to a cousin in France. Here her mind gave way,\r\nand she was placed in an asylum, where she died in 1847, aged 71.\r\n\r\nOn the tombstone, in St. Michael’s churchyard, of Bailie William\r\nFingass, who died in 1686, is an inscription to a descendant, Anna\r\nGrieve, daughter of James Grieve, merchant, who died in 1813, aged 19,\r\nwith the following lines subjoined:\r\n\r\n               ‘Ta main, bienfaisante et chérie,\r\n               D’un exil vient essuyer les pleurs,\r\n               Tu me vis loin de parens, de patrie,\r\n               Et le même tombeau, lorsque tu m’as ravie,\r\n               Renferme nos deux cœurs.’\r\n\r\nThe story is this. One of the French prisoners on parole at Dumfries\r\nfell in love with pretty Anna Grieve, and she regarded his suit with\r\nkindness. Had she lived they would probably have been married, for he\r\nwas in a good position and in every way worthy of her hand. When she\r\ndied in the flower in her youth, he was overwhelmed with grief, and\r\npenned the above-quoted epitaph. After a lapse of about forty-six years,\r\na gentleman of dignified bearing and seemingly about seventy years old,\r\nentered St. Michael’s churchyard, and in broken English politely\r\naccosted Mr. Watson, who was busy with his chisel on one of the\r\nmonuments. He asked to be shown the spot where Mademoiselle Grieve was\r\nburied, and on being taken to it exhibited deep emotion. He read over\r\nthe epitaph, which seemed to be quite familiar to him, and it was\r\napparent that it was engraved upon the tablets of his memory, he being\r\nnone other than the lover of the lady who lay below, and for whom,\r\nalthough half a century had elapsed, he still retained his old\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n(I should say here that for many of the details about Sanquhar and\r\nDumfries I am indebted in the first place to Mrs. Macbeth Forbes, for\r\npermission to make use of her late husband’s notes on the prisoner-life\r\nat these places, and in the second to the hon. secretary of the\r\nDumfriesshire and Galloway Natural History and Antiquarian Society, for\r\nthe use of a résumé by him of those notes.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MELROSE\r\n\r\nIn the life of Dr. George Lawson, of Selkirk, the French prisoners on\r\nparole at Melrose are alluded to. The doctor astonished them with his\r\nknowledge of the old-world French with which they were unacquainted, and\r\nseveral pages of the book are devoted to the eloquent attempts of one of\r\nthe prisoners to bring him to the Roman Catholic communion.\r\n\r\nAppended to the minutes of the Quarterly Meeting of the Melrose\r\nFreemasons on September 25, 1813, in an account of the laying the\r\nfoundation-stone of a public well, there is the following reference to\r\nthe French prisoners interned at Melrose (the minutes of the Kelso,\r\nSelkirk, and other lodges record the fraternal exchange of courtesies,\r\nand the reception of these alien Brethren into the lodges, but at\r\nMelrose it would seem that these Brethren held a lodge of their own,\r\nwhich they no doubt worked in their native tongue and style, by leave\r\nand warrant of the Melrose Lodge):\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The French Brethren of the Lodge of St. John under the distinctive\r\nappellation of _Benevolence_ constituted by the French prisoners of war\r\non parole here, were invited to attend, which the Master,\r\noffice-bearers, and many of the Brethren accordingly did.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lodge has preserved in its archives a document with the names of the\r\nFrench prisoners, adhibited to an expression of their appreciation of\r\nthe kindness they had received during their sojourn at Melrose, which\r\nwas given to the Brethren at the conclusion of the war when they were\r\npermitted to return to their own country and homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                JEDBURGH\r\n\r\nMr. Maberley Phillips, F.S.A., from whose pamphlet on prisoners of war\r\nin the North I shall quote later (pp. 388–9) a description of an escape\r\nof paroled prisoners from Jedburgh, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Jedburgh had its share of French prisoners. They were for the most part\r\nkindly treated, and many of them were permitted a great amount of\r\nliberty. One of these had a taste for archaeology and visited all the\r\nruins within the precincts of his radius, namely, a mile from the Cross.\r\nThere is a tradition that on one of his excursions, he was directed to a\r\nruin about a quarter of a mile beyond his appointed mark, which happened\r\nto be a milestone. He asked the Provost for permission to go beyond;\r\nthat worthy, however, refused, but he quietly added: “If Mr. Combat did\r\nwalk a short distance beyond the mile and nobody said anything, nothing\r\nwould come of it.” But the Frenchman had given his word of honour, and\r\nhe could not break it. A happy thought struck him. He borrowed a barrow\r\none afternoon, and with it and the necessary implements proceeded out to\r\nthe obnoxious milestone. Having “unshipped” the milestone, he raised it\r\non to the barrow, and triumphantly wheeled it to the required distance,\r\nwhere he fixed it.... For a generation the stone stood where the\r\nFrenchman placed it, no one being any the worse for the extra extent of\r\nthe Scotch mile.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the prisoners were naval officers and were deeply versed in\r\nscience, including navigation and astronomy. A favourite resort of these\r\nwas Inchbonny, the abode of James Veitch, the self-taught astronomer.\r\nInchbonny is situated up the Jed about half a mile from Jedburgh. Among\r\nthe prisoners who made a point of visiting Veitch’s workshop we may\r\nmention Scot, an old naval lieutenant, who with a long grey coat was to\r\nbe seen at every gleam of sunshine at the Meridian line with compasses\r\nin hand, resolving to determine the problem of finding the longitude,\r\nand M. Charles Jehenne, who belonged to the navy, and who was captured\r\nat the battle of Trafalgar. He on that memorable day from the masthead\r\nof his vessel observed the British fleet under Nelson bearing down upon\r\nthe French and Spanish vessels. ‘They saw us’, he was wont to say,\r\n‘before we saw them.’ He was a constant visitor to the workshop, and\r\nconstructed a telescope there for his own use. He was most agreeable in\r\nhis manner, and careful not to give any trouble when doing any work for\r\nhimself with Veitch’s tools. He also was an astronomer, and would often\r\nstay out at Inchbonny, in order to view the stars through Veitch’s\r\ntelescopes, until long after the tolling of the bell which warned the\r\nprisoners that the daily period of liberty had again expired. In order\r\nthat he might escape being noticed by the observant eyes of any who\r\nmight be desirous of obtaining the reward given for a conviction, he\r\nusually got the loan of Veitch’s plaid, and, muffled in this, reached\r\nhis quarters undetected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JEDBURGH ABBEY, 1812\r\n\r\n  _From a painting by Ensign Bazin, a French prisoner of war_\r\n]\r\n\r\nBilleted along with Jehenne, and staying in the same room, was Ensign\r\nBazin, of St. Malo, a man of quiet demeanour, captured on the _Torche_\r\ncorvette in 1805. He was very talented with his pencil, and fond of\r\ndrawing sketches of Jedburgh characters, many of which are preserved at\r\nInchbonny. He made a painting of Jedburgh Abbey, which he dedicated to\r\nMr. Veitch, dated 1812. In this picture the French prisoners are seen\r\nmarching on the ramparts, and, in the original, their faces and forms,\r\nas also those of many local characters, are so admirably sketched as to\r\nbe easily recognizable. A duplicate of this picture he sent home to his\r\nmother. Mrs. Grant of Laggan perhaps had Bazin in view when in her\r\n_Memoir of a Highland Lady_, she wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A number of French prisoners, officers, were on parole at Jedburgh.\r\nLord Buchanan, whom we met there, took us to see a painting in progress\r\nby one of them; some battlefield, all the figures portraits from memory.\r\nThe picture was already sold and part paid for, and another ordered,\r\nwhich we were very glad of, the handsome young painter having interested\r\nus much.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October 1813, Bazin received a pass to be sent to Alresford, and he\r\nwas noted, ‘to be exchanged at the first opportunity. Has been long\r\nimprisoned, and is a great favourite.’ He was of wealthy parents, and\r\ngot back to France some time before his fellow prisoners were released.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant thus spoke of the Jedburgh prisoners:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The ingenuity of the French prisoners of all ranks was amazing, only to\r\nbe equalled by their industry; those of them unskilled in higher arts\r\nearned for themselves most comfortable additions to their allowance by\r\nturning bits of wood, bones, straw, almost anything in fact, into neat\r\ntoys of many sorts, eagerly bought up by all who met with them.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Veitch’s house, Inchbonny, may be seen by those fortunate enough\r\nto have a personal introduction, much of the French prisoner\r\nhandiwork—sketches, telescopes, and an electric machine with which the\r\npoor fellows had much fun, connecting it with wires to a plate on the\r\nwindow-sill below, whereto they would invite passers-by—generally\r\ngirls—for a chat and a joke, the result being a shock which sent them\r\nflying.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that when the word came that the Frenchmen were to be\r\nallowed to return to their native land, they caused their manufactures\r\nand other articles to be ‘rouped’. One of the prisoners whose knowledge\r\nof the English language, even after his prolonged stay in this quarter,\r\nwas very limited, was delegated to obtain the sanction of the Provost of\r\nthe Burgh to hold such roup. He who at this time graced the office of\r\nprovostship had a draper’s shop in Canongate, and hither the Frenchman\r\nwent on his errand. His lack of knowledge of the popular tongue,\r\nhowever, proved to be an inconvenience, for, on arriving at the shop, he\r\ncould only request ‘A rope! A rope!’ The draper had his customary supply\r\nof old ropes, and, willing to oblige, brought them out, to the\r\nperplexity of the visitor, and commenced to ‘wale out the best of them’.\r\nSeeing that his would-be benefactor was obviously mistaken, the French\r\nenvoy reiterated his former request, and supplemented this by adding in\r\na style which would have done credit to any auctioneer, ‘One, Two,\r\nTree!’ Light dawned upon the Provost’s comprehension, and the necessary\r\npermission was not long in being granted.\r\n\r\nMany of the prisoners are supposed to have rejoined Bonaparte on his\r\nreturn from Elba, and to have fallen at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nThe officers were billeted among private citizens, says Mr. Forbes,\r\nwhile several occupied quarters immediately under the Clock Tower. Being\r\nyoung and lusty, they were dowered with an exceedingly good appetite,\r\nand as they got little to eat so far as their allowance went, some of\r\nthem used to have a pulley and hoist their loaves of bread to near the\r\nceiling to prevent themselves from devouring them all, and to ensure\r\nsomething being left over for next repast.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were not commonly spoken of by name, but were known by the\r\npersons with whom they resided, e.g., ‘Nannie Tamson’s Frenchman’,\r\n‘Widow Ross’s Frenchman’. The boys were a great plague to the Frenchmen,\r\nfor when a great victory was announced their dominie gave them a\r\nholiday, and the youngsters celebrated it too frequently by jeering the\r\nprisoners, and by shouting and cheering. The boys at a school then\r\nbeside the road at No. 1 Milestone, were prominent in these triumphant\r\ndisplays, and sometimes pelted the prisoners with stones.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the Jedburgh prisoners are thus alluded to in the _False\r\nAlarm_, a local pamphlet:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘They were very polite, and not infrequently put us rough-spun Scotchmen\r\nto the blush with their polished manners. They came in course of time to\r\nbe liked, but it seems some of the older members of the community could\r\nnever be brought to fraternize with them. One old man actually pointed\r\nhis gun at them, and threatened to fire because they had exceeded their\r\nwalking limit.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAn aged Jedburgh lady’s reminiscences are interesting. She says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Among the officers was M. Espinasse, who settled in Edinburgh after the\r\nPeace and engaged in teaching; Baron Goldshord or Gottshaw, who married\r\na Jedburgh lady, a Miss Waugh; another, whose name I do not remember,\r\nmarried a Miss Jenny Wintrope, who went with him to the South of France.\r\nThere was a Captain Rivoli, also a Captain Racquet, and a number of\r\nothers who were well received by the townspeople, and frequently invited\r\nto parties in their homes, to card-clubs, etc. They were for the most\r\npart pleasant, agreeable gentlemen, and made many friends. Almost all of\r\nthem employed themselves in work of some kind, besides playing at\r\ndifferent kinds of games, shooting small birds, and fishing for trout.\r\nThey much enjoyed the liberty granted them of walking one mile out of\r\nthe town in any direction, as within that distance there were many\r\nbeautiful walks when they could go out one road, turn, and come back by\r\nanother. During their stay, when news had been received of one great\r\nBritish victory, the magistrates permitted rejoicing, and a great\r\nbonfire was kindled at the Cross, and an effigy of Napoleon was set on a\r\ndonkey and paraded round the town by torchlight, and round the bonfire,\r\nand then cast into the flames. I have often heard an old gentleman, who\r\nhad given the boots and part of the clothing, say he never regretted\r\ndoing anything so much in his life, as helping on that great show, when\r\nhe saw the pain it gave to these poor gentlemen-prisoners, who felt so\r\nmuch at seeing the affront put upon their great commander.\r\n\r\n‘The French prisoners have always been ingenious in the use they made of\r\ntheir meat bones ... they took them and pounded them into a powder which\r\nthey mixed with the soft food they were eating. It is even said that\r\nthey flourished on this dissolved phosphate of lime and gelatine.\r\n\r\n‘There was an old game called “cradles” played in those days. Two or\r\nthree persons clasp each other’s hands, and when their arms are held\r\nstraight out at full length, a person is placed on these stretched\r\nhands, who is sent up in the air and down again, landing where he\r\nstarted from. A farmer thought he would try the experiment on the\r\nFrenchmen. Some buxom lassies were at work as some of them passed, and\r\nhe gave the girls the hint to treat the foreigners to the “cradles”.\r\nAccordingly two of them were jerked well up in the air to fall again on\r\nthe sturdy hands of the wenches. The experiment was repeated again and\r\nagain until the Frenchmen were glad to call a halt.’\r\n\r\n\r\nParole-breaking was rather common, and began some months after the\r\nofficers arrived in the town. A party of five set out for Blyth in\r\nSeptember 1811, but were brought to Berwick under a military escort, and\r\nlodged in jail. Next day they were marched to Penicuik under charge of a\r\nparty of the Forfarshire Militia. Three of them were good-looking young\r\nmen; one in particular had a very interesting countenance, and, wishing\r\none day to extend his walk, in order to get some watercress for salad,\r\nbeyond the limit of the one-mile stone, uprooted it, and carried it in\r\nhis arms as far as he wished to go.\r\n\r\nThree other officers were captured the same year, and sent to Edinburgh\r\nCastle, and in 1813 occurred the escape and capture to be described\r\nlater (p. 388).\r\n\r\nThe highest number of prisoners at Jedburgh was 130, and there were\r\nthree deaths during their stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HAWICK\r\n\r\nI owe my best thanks to Mr. J. John Vernon, hon. secretary of the Hawick\r\nArchaeological Society, for the following note on Hawick:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Not many of Napoleon’s officers were men of means, so to the small\r\nallowance they received from the British Government, they were permitted\r\nto eke out their income by teaching, sketching, or painting, or by\r\nmaking little trifles which they disposed of as best they could among\r\nthe townspeople. At other times they made a little money by giving\r\nmusical and dramatic entertainments, which proved a source of enjoyment\r\nto the audience and of profit to themselves.\r\n\r\n‘Though “prisoners”, they had a considerable freedom, being allowed to\r\ngo about as they pleased anywhere within a radius of a mile from the\r\nTower Knowe. During their residence in Hawick they became very popular\r\namong all classes of the people and much regret was expressed when the\r\ntime came for their returning to the Continent. Hawick society was\r\ndecidedly the poorer by their departure. Paradoxical it may seem, but\r\nmost of those who were termed “French Prisoners” were in reality of\r\nGerman extraction: Fifteen of their number became members of the\r\nFreemasons, St. John’s Lodge, No. 111. They were lodged in private\r\nhouses throughout the towns. No. 44 High Street was the residence of a\r\nnumber of them, who dwelt in it from June 1812 to June 1814.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Freemasonry in Hawick, Mr. W. Fred Vernon says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Each succeeding year saw the Lodge more thinly attended. An impetus to\r\nthe working and attendance was given about 1810 by the affiliation and\r\ninitiation of several of the French prisoners of war who were billeted\r\nin the town, and from time to time to the close of the war in 1815, the\r\nattendance and prosperity of the Lodge was in striking contrast to what\r\nit had been previously.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from a book upon Hawick published by Mr. J.\r\nJohn Vernon in November 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘One of Bonaparte’s officers, compelled to reside for nearly two years\r\nin Hawick, thus expressed himself regarding the weather during the\r\nwinter, and at the same time his opinion of the people. In reply to a\r\nsympathetic remark that the weather must be very trying to one who had\r\ncome from a more genial climate, the officer said:\r\n\r\n‘“It is de devil’s wedder, but you have de heaven contré for all dat.\r\nYou have de cold, de snow, de frozen water, and de sober dress; but you\r\nhave de grand constitution, and de manners and equality that we did\r\nfight for so long. I see in your street de priest and de shoemaker; de\r\nbanker and de baker, de merchant and de hosier all meet together, be\r\ncompanions and be happy. Dis is de equality dat de French did fight for\r\nand never got, not de ting de English newspapers say we want. Ah!\r\nScotland be de fine contré and de people be de wise, good men.... De\r\nEnglish tell me at Wincanton dat de Scots be a nation of sauvages. It\r\nwas a lie. De English be de sauvages and de Scots be de civilized\r\npeople. De high Englishman be rich and good; de low Englishman be de\r\nbrute. In Scotland de people be all de same! Oh! Scotland be a fine\r\ncontré!\r\n\r\n‘The fact that so many of the French prisoners of war were quartered in\r\nHawick from 1812–14 did much towards brightening society during that\r\ntime. Pity for their misfortunes prevailed over any feeling that the\r\nname “Frenchman” might formerly have excited, and they were welcomed in\r\nthe homes of the Hawick people. It heartened them to be asked to dinner;\r\nas one of them remarked: “De heart of hope do not jump in de hungry\r\nbelly”, and many valued friendships were thus formed.’\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The presence of so many well-dressed persons for so long a period\r\nproduced a marked reform in the costume of the inhabitants of Hawick,’\r\nsays James Wilson in his _Annals of Hawick_.\r\n\r\nThe first prisoners came to Hawick in January 1812. Of these,\r\nthirty-seven came from Wincanton, forty-one came direct from Spain a\r\nlittle later, thirty-seven from Launceston. The prisoners had been sent\r\nhither from such distant places as Launceston and Wincanton on account\r\nof the increasing number of escapes from these places, the inhabitants\r\nof both of which, as we have seen, were notoriously in sympathy with the\r\nforeigners. Two surgeons came from the Greenlaw dépôt to attend on them.\r\nMr. William Nixon, of Lynnwood, acted as agent, or commissary, and by\r\nthe end of 1812 he had 120 prisoners in his charge. A few of the Hawick\r\nprisoners were quite well-to-do. There is a receipt extant of a Captain\r\nGrupe which shows that he had a monthly remittance from Paris of £13\r\n4_s._ 6_d._, in addition to his pay and subsistence money as a prisoner\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nIn the _Kelso Mail_ of June 20, 1814, is the following testimony from\r\nthe prisoners, on leaving, to the kind and hospitable treatment they had\r\nso generally received:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   ‘Hawick, May 2, 1814.\r\n\r\n‘The French officers on parole at Hawick, wishing to express their\r\ngratitude to the inhabitants of the town and its vicinity for the\r\nliberal behaviour which they have observed to them, and the good opinion\r\nwhich they have experienced from them, unanimously request the\r\nMagistrates and Mr. Nixon, their Commissary, to be so kind as to allow\r\nthem to express their sentiments to them, and to assure them that they\r\nwill preserve the remembrance of all the marks of friendship which they\r\nhave received from them. May the wishes which the French officers make\r\nfor the prosperity of the town and the happiness of its inhabitants be\r\nfully accomplished. Such is the most ardent wish, the dearest hope of\r\nthose who have the honour to be their most humble servants.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases intercourse did not cease with the departure of the\r\nprisoners, and men who had received kindnesses as aliens kept up\r\ncorrespondence with those who had pitied and befriended them.\r\n\r\nOn May 18, 1814, the officers at Hawick, mostly, if not entirely,\r\nBonaparte’s soldiers, drifted with the Royalist tide, and sent an\r\naddress to Louis XVIII, conceived in much the same terms as that from\r\nDumfries already quoted, speaking of ‘the happy events which have taken\r\nplace in our country, and which have placed on the throne of his\r\nancestors the illustrious family of Bourbon’, and adding, ‘we lay at the\r\nfeet of the worthy descendant of Henry IV the homage of our entire\r\nobedience and fidelity’.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were always welcome visitors at the house of Goldielands\r\nadjoining the fine old peel tower of that name, and I give the following\r\npleasant testimony of one of them:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ‘To Mr. Elliott of Goldielands:\r\n\r\n ‘SIR,\r\n\r\n‘Very sorry that before my leaving Scotland I could not have the\r\npleasure of passing some hours with you. I take the liberty of\r\naddressing you these few lines, the principal object of which is to\r\nthank you for all the particular kindness and friendship you honoured me\r\nwith during my stay in this country. The more lively I always felt this\r\nyour kindness since idle prejudices had not the power over you to treat\r\nus with that coldness and reserve which foreigners, and the more so,\r\nprisoners of war in Britain, so often meet with.\r\n\r\n‘If in the case only that my conduct whilst I had the honour of being\r\nacquainted with you, has not met with your disapproval, I pray you to\r\npreserve me, even so far off, your friendship. To hear sometimes of you\r\nwould certainly cause me great pleasure.\r\n\r\n‘Pray acquaint Mrs. Elliott and the rest of your family of the high\r\nesteem with which I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n\r\n                                            ‘Your humble servant,\r\n                                                  ‘G. DE TALLARD, Lieut.\r\n\r\n ‘Hawick, March 11, 1814.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LAUDER\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the late Mr. Macbeth Forbes for these notes.\r\n\r\nThere hangs in one of the rooms of Thirlestane Castle, the baronial\r\nresidence of the Earls of Lauderdale, an oil-painting executed by a\r\nFrench prisoner of war, Lieutenant-Adjutant George Maurer of the\r\nHesse-Darmstadt Infantry. He is described in the Admiralty Records as a\r\nyouth of twenty, with hazel eyes, fresh complexion, five feet nine and\r\nthree-quarter inches in height, well made, but with a small sword scar\r\non his left cheek. Although his production is by no means a striking\r\nwork of art, it is nevertheless cherished as a memento of the time\r\nwhen—a hundred years ago—French prisoners were billeted in Lauder,\r\nBerwickshire, and indulged in pleasant intercourse with the inhabitants\r\nof this somewhat remote and out-of-the-way country town. In the left\r\ncorner of the painting, which represents Lauder as seen from the west,\r\nis a portrait, dated August 1813, of the artist decked in a sort of\r\nTam-o’-Shanter bonnet, swallow-tailed coat, and knee breeches, plying\r\nhis brush.\r\n\r\nThe average number of prisoners at Lauder was between fifty and sixty,\r\nand the average age was twenty-six. They appear to have conducted\r\nthemselves with great propriety in the quiet town; none of them was ever\r\nsent to the Tolbooth. They resided for the most part with burgesses, one\r\nof whom was James Haswell, a hairdresser, whose son remembered two of\r\nthe prisoners who lived in his father’s house, and who made for him and\r\nhis brothers, as boys, suits of regimentals with cocked hats, and\r\nmarched them through the town with bayonets at their sides.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of January 1812, Captain Pequendaire, of _L’Espoir_\r\nprivateer, escaped. At Lauder he never spoke a word of English to any\r\none, and about six weeks after his arrival he disappeared. It came out\r\nthat he had walked to Stow, near Lauder, and taken the coach there, and\r\nthat he had got off because he spoke English so perfectly as to pass for\r\na native!\r\n\r\nAngot, second captain of _L’Espoir_, was released upon the\r\nrepresentation of inhabitants of St. Valery, that he with others had\r\nsaved the lives of seventy-nine British seamen wrecked on the coast.\r\n\r\nA duel took place on a terrace on the east side of Lauderdale Castle\r\nbetween two prisoners armed with razors fastened to the end of\r\nwalking-sticks. No harm was done on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were always kindly and hospitably treated by the\r\ninhabitants. On one occasion some of them were at a dinner-party at Mr.\r\nBrodie’s, a farmer of Pilmuir. The farm was beyond the one-mile limit,\r\nbut no notice would have been taken if the prisoners had duly reported\r\nthemselves and enabled the Agent to make the necessary declaration, but,\r\nunfortunately, a heavy snowstorm prevented them from getting back to\r\nLauder, and the report went in that So-and-so had not appeared. The\r\nTransport Board at once dealt with the matter, and the parish Minister,\r\nthe Rev. Peter Cosens, who had been one of the party at Pilmuir, wrote\r\nto the authorities by way of explaining, and the reply received was very\r\nsevere, the authorities expressing surprise that one in his position\r\nshould have given countenance to, and should seek to palliate or excuse,\r\nthe offence. The result to the prisoners is not known, but they were\r\nprobably let off with a fine stopped out of their allowance.\r\n\r\nMany of the prisoners knew little or no English when they came to\r\nLauder. On the occasion of a detachment coming into the town, some of\r\nthe baggage had not arrived, and the interpreter of the party appeared\r\nbefore the Agent, and made a low bow, and held up a finger for each\r\npackage that was wanting, and uttered the only appropriate English word\r\nhe knew, ‘Box’. Another, who wished to buy eggs, went into a shop, and,\r\ndrawing his cloak around him, sat down and clucked like a hen.\r\n\r\nMany of the prisoners in the Scottish towns were Germans in French\r\nservice. In January 1813, the Lauder St. Luke’s Lodge of Freemasons\r\nadmitted eight Germans and one Frenchman, and it is related that on the\r\noccasion of their induction, when the time for refreshments after\r\nbusiness came, the foreign installations delighted the company with\r\nyarns of their military experiences. When the great movement for German\r\nliberty got into full swing, Britain encouraged the French prisoners of\r\nGerman nationality to fight for their own country. Accordingly the\r\neleven German prisoners in Lauder, belonging to the Hesse-Darmstadt\r\nregiment, received £5 each at the end of February 1814, to pay their\r\nexpenses to Hawick, whence to proceed to the seat of war. It is related\r\nthat the joy they felt at their release was diminished by their regret\r\nat leaving the town where they had been treated by the inhabitants with\r\nso much marked hospitality and kindness. The evening previous to their\r\ndeparture, the magistrates gave them an entertainment at the _Black\r\nBull_ Inn, and wished them all success in their efforts to restore\r\nliberty and prosperity. The remaining twenty-two prisoners finally left\r\nLauder, June 3, 1814; others having been previously removed to Jedburgh,\r\nKelso, and Dumfries. While they were in Lauder some of the merchants\r\ngave them credit, and they were honourably repaid on the prisoners’\r\nreturn to their own country. Maurer, the artist before alluded to, often\r\nrevisited his friends in Lauder, and always called on and dined with the\r\nAgent, and talked over old times.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LOCKERBIE AND LOCHMABEN\r\n\r\nAbout a score of prisoners were at each of these places, but as the\r\nrecord of their lives here is of very much the same character as of\r\nprisoner life elsewhere, it hardly makes a demand upon the reader’s\r\nattention. In both places the exiles conducted themselves peaceably and\r\nquietly, and they, especially the doctors, were well liked by the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n                       PRISONERS OF WAR IN WALES\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN MONTGOMERYSHIRE\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Canon Thomas of Llandrinio Rectory, Llanymynech, for\r\ninformation which led me to extract the following interesting details\r\nfrom the Montgomeryshire Archaeological Collections.\r\n\r\nBatches of French officers were on parole during the later years of the\r\nNapoleonic wars at Llanfyllin, Montgomery, Bishop’s Castle, Newtown, and\r\nWelshpool.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Llanfyllin_\r\n\r\nAbout 120 French and Germans were quartered here during the years 1812\r\nand 1813. Many of them lived together in a large house, formerly the\r\nGriffith residence, which stood where is now Bachie Place. Others were\r\nat the ‘Council House’ in High Street. In a first-floor room of this\r\nlatter may still be seen thirteen frescoes in crayon executed by the\r\nprisoners, representing imaginary mountain scenery. Formerly there were\r\nsimilar frescoes in a neighbouring house, once the _Rampant Lion_ Inn,\r\nnow a tailor’s shop, but these have been papered over, and according to\r\nthe correspondent who supplies the information, ‘utterly destroyed’.\r\nThese prisoners were liberally supplied with money, which they spent\r\nfreely. An attachment sprang up between a prisoner, Captain Angerau, and\r\nthe Rector’s daughter, which resulted in their marriage after the Peace\r\nof 1814. It is interesting to note that in 1908 a grandson of Captain\r\nAngerau visited Llanfyllin.\r\n\r\nThe following pleasing testimony I take from _Bygones_, October 30,\r\n1878:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The German soldiers from Hessia, so well received by the inhabitants of\r\nLlanfyllin during their captivity, have requested the undersigned to\r\nstate that the kindness and the favour shewn them by the esteemed\r\ninhabitants of Llanfyllin will ever remain in their thankful\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\n                                                        ‘C. W. WEDIKIND.\r\n\r\n ‘Newtown, June 17, 1817.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Montgomery_\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ contributed a notice of\r\nthe death at Montgomery of an old gentleman named Chatuing who had been\r\nnearly four years a prisoner in that town, and who had preferred to\r\nremain there after the Peace of 1814.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we come across evidence that there were men among the\r\nprisoners on parole who were not above acting as Government spies among\r\ntheir fellows. One Beauvernet at Montgomery was evidently one of these,\r\nfor a Transport Office letter to the Agent in that town in 1806 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Beauvernet may rest perfectly satisfied that any information\r\ncommunicated by him will not in any way be used to his detriment or\r\ndisadvantage.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAllen, the Montgomery Agent, is directed to advance Beauvernet £10, as\r\npart of what ultimately would be given him. One Muller was the object of\r\nsuspicion, and he was probably an escape agent, as in later letters\r\nBeauvernet is to be allowed to choose where he will ‘work’, and\r\neventually, on the news that Muller has gone to London, is given a\r\npassport thither, and another £10. Of course it does not follow from\r\nthis that Beauvernet was actually a prisoner of war, and he may have\r\nbeen one of the foreign agents employed by Government at good pay to\r\nwatch the prisoners more unostentatiously than could a regular prisoner\r\nagent, but the opening sentence of the official letter seems to point to\r\nthe fact that he was a prisoner.\r\n\r\nA French officer on parole at Montgomery, named Dumont, was imprisoned\r\nfor refusing to support an illegitimate child, so that it came upon the\r\nrates. He wrote, however, to Lady Pechell, declaring that he was the\r\nvictim ‘of a sworn lie of an abandoned creature’, complaining that he\r\nwas shut up with the local riff-raff, half starved, and penniless, and\r\nimploring her to influence the Transport Board to give him the\r\nsubsistence money which had been taken from him since his committal to\r\nprison to pay for the child. What the Transport Board replied does not\r\nappear, but from the frequency of these complaints on the part of\r\nprisoners, there seems no doubt that, although local records show that\r\nillicit amours were largely indulged in by French and other officers on\r\nparole, in our country towns, much advantage of the sinning of a few was\r\ntaken by unprincipled people to blackmail others.\r\n\r\nIn the _Cambrian_ of May 2, 1806, is the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘At the last Quarter Sessions for Montgomeryshire, a farmer of the\r\nneighbourhood of Montgomery was prosecuted by order of the Transport\r\nOffice for assaulting one of the French prisoners on parole, and,\r\npleading guilty to the indictment, was fined £10, and ordered to find\r\nsureties for keeping the peace for twelve months. This is the second\r\nprosecution which the Board has ordered, it being determined that the\r\nprisoners shall be protected by Government from insult while they remain\r\nin their unfortunate position as Prisoners of War.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Bishop’s Castle_\r\n\r\nAt Bishop’s Castle there were many prisoners, and in _Bygones_ Thomas\r\nCaswell records chats with an old man named Meredith, in the workhouse,\r\nwho had been servant at the _Six Bells_, where nine officers were\r\nquartered. ‘They cooked their own food, and I waited upon them. They\r\nwere very talkative ... they were not short of money, and behaved very\r\nwell to me for waiting upon them.’\r\n\r\nThe attempted escape of two Bishop’s Castle prisoners is described on\r\npage 391.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Newtown_\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Mr. David Morgan of the Canal Basin, Newtown, who is now (February\r\n1895) 81 years of age, remembers over 300 prisoners passing through\r\nKerry village on their way from London via Ludlow, to Newtown. He was\r\nthen a little boy attending Kerry school, and the children all ran out\r\nto see them. All were on foot, and were said to be all officers. A great\r\nnumber of them were billeted at various public-houses, and some in\r\nprivate houses in Newtown. They exerted themselves greatly in putting\r\nout a fire at the _New Inn_ in Severn Street, and were to be seen, says\r\nmy informant, an aged inhabitant, “like cats about the roof “. When\r\nPeace was made, they returned to France, and many of them were killed at\r\nWaterloo. The news of that great battle and victory reached Newtown on\r\nPig Fair Day, in June 1815. I have a memorandum book of M. Auguste\r\nTricoche, one of the prisoners, who appears to have served in the French\r\nfleet in the West Indies, and to have been taken prisoner at the capture\r\nof Martinique in 1810.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Welshpool_\r\n\r\n\r\n‘On the occasion of a great fire at the corner shop in December 1813,\r\nthere was a terrific explosion of gunpowder which hurled portions of\r\ntimber into the Vicarage garden, some distance off. The French prisoners\r\nwere very active, and some of them formed a line to the Lledan brook\r\n(which at that time was not culverted over), whence they conveyed water\r\nto the burning building to others of their comrades who courageously\r\nentered it.\r\n\r\n‘Dr. P. L. Serph, one of the prisoners, settled down at Welshpool, where\r\nhe obtained a large practice as a physician and surgeon, and continued\r\nto reside there until the time of his death. Dr. Serph married Ann, the\r\ndaughter of John Moore, late of Crediton in the county of Devon,\r\ngentleman, by Elizabeth his wife. Mrs. Serph died in 1837, and there is\r\na monument to their memory in Welshpool churchyard.\r\n\r\n‘There is at Gungrog a miniature of Mrs. Morris Jones painted by a\r\nFrench prisoner; also a water colour of the waterfall at Pystyl Rhaiadr,\r\nwhich is attributed to one of them. I recollect seeing in the possession\r\nof the late Mr. Oliver E. Jones, druggist, a view of Powis Castle,\r\ningeniously made of diverse-coloured straws, the work of one of the\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n‘It is said that French blood runs in the veins of some of the\r\ninhabitants of each of these towns where the prisoners were located.\r\n\r\n                                                          ‘R. WILLIAMS.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                            IN PEMBROKESHIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Pembroke_\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Howard the philanthropist visited Pembroke, and reported to this\r\neffect:\r\n\r\nHe found thirty-seven American prisoners of war herded together in an\r\nold house, some of them without shoes or stockings, all of them scantily\r\nclad and in a filthy condition. There were no tables of victualling and\r\nregulations hung up, nor did the prisoners know anything more about\r\nallowances than that they were the same as for the French prisoners. The\r\nfloors were covered with straw which had not been changed for seven\r\nweeks. There were three patients in the hospital house, in which the\r\naccommodation was very poor.\r\n\r\nFifty-six French prisoners were in an old house adjoining the American\r\nprison. Most of them had no shoes or stockings, and some had no shirts.\r\nThere was no victualling table and the prisoners knew nothing about\r\ntheir allowance. Two or three of them had a money allowance, which\r\nshould have been 3/6 per week each, for aliment, but from this 6_d._ was\r\nalways deducted. They lay on boards without straw, and there were only\r\nfour hammocks in two rooms occupied by thirty-six prisoners. There was a\r\ncourt for airing, but no water and no sewer. In two rooms of the town\r\njail were twenty French prisoners. They had some straw, but it had not\r\nbeen changed for many weeks. There was no supply of water in the jail,\r\nand as the prisoners were not allowed to go out and fetch it, they had\r\nto do without it. On one Sunday morning they had had no water since\r\nFriday evening. The bread was tolerable, the beer very small, the\r\nallowance of beef so scanty that the prisoners preferred the allowance\r\nof cheese and butter. In the hospital were nine French prisoners,\r\nbesides five of the _Culloden’s_ crew, and three Americans. All lay on\r\nstraw with coverlets, but without sheets, mattresses, or bedsteads.\r\n\r\nThis was perhaps the worst prison visited by Howard, and he emphatically\r\nrecommended the appointment of a regular inspector. In 1779 complaints\r\ncame from Pembroke of the unnecessary use of fire-arms by the militiamen\r\non guard, and that 150 prisoners were crowded into one small house with\r\nan airing yard twenty-five paces square—this was the year of Howard’s\r\nvisit. His recommendations seem to have had little effect, for in 1781\r\ntwenty-six prisoners signed a complaint that the quantity and the\r\nquality of the provisions were deficient; that they had shown the Agent\r\nthat the bread was ill-baked, black, and of bad taste, but he had taken\r\nno notice; that he gave them cow’s flesh, which was often bad, thinking\r\nthat they would refuse it and buy other at their own expense; that he\r\nvexed them as much as he could, telling them that the bread and meat\r\nwere too good for Frenchmen; that on their complaining about short\r\nmeasure and weight he refused to have the food measured and weighed in\r\ntheir presence in accordance with the regulations; that he tried to get\r\na profit out of the straw supplied by making it last double the\r\nregulation time without changing it, so that they were obliged to buy it\r\nfor themselves; and that he had promised them blankets, but, although it\r\nwas the raw season of the year, none had yet been issued.\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the Admiralty inspector reported that the condition of the dépôt\r\nat Pembroke was very unsatisfactory; the discipline slack, as the Agent\r\npreferred to live away at Hubberstone, and only put in an occasional\r\nappearance; and that the state of the prisoners was mutinous to a\r\ndangerous degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _The Fishguard affair of 1797_\r\n\r\nIf the Great Western Railway had not brought Fishguard into prominence\r\nas a port of departure for America, it would still be famous as the\r\nscene of the last foreign invasion of England. On February 22, 1797,\r\nfifteen hundred Frenchmen, half of whom were picked men and half galley\r\nslaves, landed from four vessels, three of which were large frigates,\r\nunder an Irish General Tate, at Cerrig Gwasted near Fishguard. They had\r\npreviously been at Ilfracombe, where they had burned some shipping.\r\nThere was a hasty gathering of ill-armed pitmen and peasants to\r\nwithstand them, and these were presently joined by Lord Cawdor with\r\n3,000 men, of whom 700 were well-trained Militia. Cawdor rode forward to\r\nreconnoitre, and General Tate, deceived, as a popular legend goes, into\r\nthe belief that he was opposed by a British military force of great\r\nstrength, by the appearance behind his lordship of a body of Welshwomen\r\nclad in their national red ‘whittles’ and high-crowned hats,\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\nBe the cause what it might, by February 24, without a shot being fired,\r\n700 Frenchmen were lodged in Haverfordwest Jail, 500 in St. Mary’s\r\nChurch, and the rest about the town. Later on, for security, 500\r\nFrenchmen were shut up in the Golden Tower, Pembroke, and with this last\r\nbody a romance is associated. Two girls were daily employed in cleaning\r\nthe prison, and on their passage to and fro became aware of two handsome\r\nyoung Frenchmen among the prisoners selling their manufactures at the\r\ndaily market, who were equally attracted by them. The natural results\r\nwere flirtation and the concoction of a plan of escape for the\r\nprisoners. The girls contrived to smuggle into the prison some shin\r\nbones of horses and cows, which the prisoners shaped into digging tools,\r\nand started to excavate a passage sixty feet long under the prison walls\r\nto the outer ditch which was close to the harbour, the earth thus dug\r\nout being daily carried away by the girls in the pails they used in\r\ntheir cleaning operations. Six weeks of continuous secret labour saw the\r\ncompletion of the task, and all that now remained was to secure a vessel\r\nto carry the performers away. Lord Cawdor’s yacht at anchor offered the\r\nopportunity. Some reports say that a hundred prisoners got out by the\r\ntunnel and boarded the yacht and a sloop lying at hand; but at any rate,\r\nthe two girls and five and twenty prisoners secured the yacht, and,\r\nfavoured by a thick fog, weighed anchor and got away. For three days\r\nthey drifted about; then, meeting a brig, they hailed her, represented\r\nthemselves as shipwrecked mariners, and were taken aboard. They learned\r\nthat a reward of £500 was being offered for the apprehension of the two\r\ngirls who had liberated a hundred prisoners, and replied by clapping the\r\nbrig’s crew under hatches, and setting their course for St. Malo, which\r\nthey safely reached.\r\n\r\nThe girls married their lovers, and one of them, Madame Roux, ci-devant\r\nEleanor Martin, returned to Wales when peace was declared, and is said\r\nto have kept an inn at Merthyr, her husband getting a berth at the\r\niron-works.\r\n\r\nAnother of General Tate’s men, a son of the Marquis de Saint-Amans,\r\nmarried Anne Beach, sister-in-law of the Rev. James Thomas, Vicar of St.\r\nMary’s, Haverfordwest, and head master of the Grammar School. General\r\nTate himself was confined in Portchester Castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            IN MONMOUTHSHIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Abergavenny_\r\n\r\nThere were some two hundred officers on parole here, but the only memory\r\nof them extant is associated with the Masonic Lodge, ‘Enfants de Mars et\r\nde Neptune’, which was worked by them about 1813–14. Tradition says that\r\nthe officers’ mess room, an apartment in Monk Street, remarkable for a\r\nhandsome arched ceiling, also served for Lodge meetings. De Grasse\r\nTilly, son of Admiral De Grasse, who was defeated by Rodney in the West\r\nIndies, was a prominent member of this Lodge. At the present\r\n‘Philanthropic’ Lodge, No. 818, Abergavenny, are preserved some collars,\r\nswords, and other articles which belonged to members of the old French\r\nprisoners’ Lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN BRECKNOCKSHIRE\r\n\r\nPrisoners were at Brecon; tombs of those who died may be seen in the old\r\nPriory Churchyard, and ‘The Captain’s Walk’ near the County Hall still\r\npreserves the memory of their favourite promenade.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 the Bailiff of Brecon requested to have the parole prisoners in\r\nthat town removed. The reason is not given, but the Transport Office\r\nrefused the request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n                       ESCAPE AGENTS AND ESCAPES\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the general reader some of the most interesting episodes of the lives\r\nof the paroled prisoners of war in Britain are those which are\r\nassociated with their escapes and attempts to escape. Now, although, as\r\nhas been already remarked, the feeling of the country people was almost\r\nunanimously against the prisoners during the early years of the parole\r\nsystem, that is, during the Seven Years’ War, from 1756 to 1763, during\r\nthe more tremendous struggles which followed that feeling was apparently\r\nquite as much in their favour, and the authorities found the\r\nco-operation of the inhabitants far more troublous to combat than the\r\ningenuity and daring of the prisoners. If the principle governing this\r\nfeeling among the upper classes of English society was one of chivalrous\r\nsympathy with brave men in misfortune, the object of the lower\r\nclasses—those most nearly concerned with the escapes—was merely gain.\r\n\r\nThere were scores of country squires and gentlemen who treated the\r\nparoled officers as guests and friends, and who no doubt secretly\r\nrejoiced when they heard of their escapes, but they could not forget\r\nthat every escape meant a breach of solemnly-pledged honour, and I have\r\nmet with very few instances of English ladies and gentlemen aiding and\r\nabetting in the escapes of paroled prisoners.\r\n\r\nSo profitable an affair was the aiding of a prisoner to escape that it\r\nsoon became as regular a profession as that of smuggling, with which it\r\nwas so intimately allied. The first instance I have seen recorded was in\r\n1759, when William Scullard, a collar-maker at Liphook, Hampshire, was\r\nbrought before the justices at the Guildford Quarter Sessions, charged\r\nwith providing horses and acting as guide to assist two French prisoners\r\nof distinction to escape—whence is not mentioned. After a long\r\nexamination he was ordered to be secured for a future hearing, and was\r\nat length committed to the New Jail in Southwark, and ordered to be\r\nfettered. The man was a reputed smuggler, could speak French, and had in\r\nhis pocket a list of all the cross-roads from Liphook round by Dorking\r\nto London.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 Charles Jones, Solicitor to the Admiralty, describes the various\r\nmethods by which the escapes of paroled prisoners are effected. They are\r\nof two kinds, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘1. By means of the smugglers and those connected with them on the\r\ncoast, who proceed with horses and covered carriages to the dépôts and\r\nby arrangement rendezvous about the hour of the evening when the\r\nprisoners ought to be within doors, about the mile limit, and thus carry\r\nthem off, travelling through the night and in daytime hiding in woods\r\nand coverts. The horses they use are excellent, and the carriages\r\nconstructed for the purpose. The prisoners are conveyed to the coast,\r\nwhere they are delivered over to the smugglers, and concealed until the\r\nboat is ready. They embark at night, and before morning are in France.\r\nThese escapes are generally in pursuance of orders received from France.\r\n\r\n‘2. By means of persons of profligate lives who, residing in or near the\r\nParole towns, act as conductors to such of the prisoners as choose to\r\nform their own plan of escape. These prisoners generally travel in\r\npost-chaises, and the conductor’s business is to pay the expenses and\r\ngive orders on the road to the innkeepers, drivers, &c., to prevent\r\ndiscovery or suspicion as to the quality of the travellers. When once a\r\nprisoner reaches a public-house or inn near the coast, he is considered\r\nsafe. But there are cases when the prisoners, having one among\r\nthemselves who can speak good English, travel without conductors. In\r\nthese cases the innkeepers and post-boys alone are to blame, and it is\r\ncertain that if this description of persons could be compelled to do\r\ntheir duty many escapes would be prevented.... The landlord of the\r\n_Fountain_ at Canterbury has been known to furnish chaises towards the\r\ncoast for six French prisoners at a time without a conductor.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer suggested that it should be made felony to assist a prisoner\r\nto escape, but the difficulty in the way of this was that juries were\r\nwell known to lean towards the accused. In the same year, 1812, however,\r\nthis came about. A Bill passed the Commons, the proposition being made\r\nby Castlereagh that to aid in the escape of a prisoner should cease to\r\nbe misdemeanour, and become a felony, punishable by transportation for\r\nseven or fourteen years, or life. Parole, he said, was a mere farce;\r\nbribery was rampant and could do anything, and an organized system\r\nexisted for furthering the escape of prisoners of rank. Within the last\r\nthree years 464 officers on parole had escaped, but abroad _not one\r\nBritish officer_ had broken his parole. The chief cause, he continued,\r\nwas the want of an Agent between the two countries for the exchange of\r\nprisoners, and it was an extraordinary feature of the War that the\r\ncommon rules about the exchange of prisoners were not observed.\r\n\r\nThe most famous escape agent was Thomas Feast Moore, _alias_ Maitland,\r\n_alias_ Herbert, but known to French prisoners as Captain Richard Harman\r\nof Folkestone. He was always flush of money, and, although he was known\r\nto be able to speak French very fluently, he never used that language in\r\nthe presence of Englishmen. He kept a complete account of all the dépôts\r\nand parole places, with the ranks of the principal prisoners thereat,\r\nand had an agent at each, a poor man who was glad for a consideration to\r\nplace well-to-do prisoners in communication with Harman, and so on the\r\nroad to escape. Harman’s charge was usually £100 for four prisoners. As\r\na rule he got letters of recommendation from the officers whose escapes\r\nhe safely negotiated, and he had the confidence of some of the principal\r\nprisoners in England and Scotland. He was generally in the neighbourhood\r\nof Whitstable and Canterbury, but, for obvious reasons, owned to no\r\nfixed residence. He seems to have been on the whole straight in his\r\ndealings, but once or twice he sailed very closely in the track of\r\nrascally agents who took money from prisoners, and either did nothing\r\nfor them, or actually betrayed them, or even murdered them.\r\n\r\nOn March 22, 1810, General Pillet, ‘Adjudant Commandant, Chef de\r\nl’État-Major of the First Division of the Army of Portugal,’ and\r\nPaolucci, commander of the _Friedland_, taken by H.M.S. _Standard_ and\r\n_Active_ in 1808, left their quarters at Alresford, and were met half a\r\nmile out by Harman with a post-chaise, into which they got and drove to\r\nWinchester, alighting in a back street while Harman went to get another\r\nchaise. Thence they drove circuitously to Hastings via Croydon,\r\nSevenoaks, Tunbridge, Robertsbridge, and Battle, Harman saying that this\r\nroute was necessary for safety, and that he would get them over, as he\r\nhad General Osten, in thirty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Hastings at 7 p.m. on March 23, and alighted outside the\r\ntown, while Harman went to get lodgings. He returned and took them to\r\nthe house of Mrs. Akers, a one-eyed woman; they waited there four days\r\nfor fair weather, and then removed to the house of one Paine, for better\r\nconcealment as the hue and cry was after them. They hid here two days,\r\nwhilst the house was searched, but their room was locked as an empty\r\nlumber room. Pillet was disgusted at the delays, and that evening wanted\r\nto go to the Mayor’s house to give himself up, but the landlord brought\r\nthem sailor clothes, and said that two women were waiting to take them\r\nwhere they pleased. They refused the clothes, went out, met Rachael\r\nHutchinson and Elizabeth Akers, and supposed they would be taken to the\r\nMayor’s house, but were at once surrounded and arrested. All this time\r\nHarman, who evidently saw that the delay caused by the foul weather was\r\nfatal to the chance that the prisoners could get off, had disappeared,\r\nbut was arrested very shortly at the inn at Hollington Corner, three\r\nmiles from Hastings. He swore that he did not know them to be escaped\r\nprisoners, but thought they were Guernsey lace-merchants.\r\n\r\nDuring the examination which followed, the Hastings town crier said that\r\nhe had announced the escape of the prisoners at forty-three different\r\npoints of the eight streets which composed Hastings.\r\n\r\nPillet and Paolucci were sent to Norman Cross, and Harman to Horsham\r\njail.\r\n\r\nAt the next examination it came out that Harman had bought a boat for\r\nthe escape from a man who understood that it was to be used for\r\nsmuggling purposes by two Guernsey lace men. The Mayor of Hastings gave\r\nit as his opinion that no Hastings petty jury would commit the prisoners\r\nfor trial, although a grand jury might, such was the local interest in\r\nthe escape-cum-smuggling business. However, they were committed. At\r\nHorsham, Harman showed to Jones, the Solicitor to the Admiralty, an iron\r\ncrown which he said had been given him by the French Government for\r\nservices rendered, but which proved to have been stolen from Paolucci’s\r\ntrunk, of which he had the key.\r\n\r\nHarman, on condition of being set free, offered to make important\r\ndisclosures to the Government respecting the escape business and its\r\nconnexion with the smugglers, but his offer was declined, and, much to\r\nhis disgust, he was sent to serve in the navy. ‘He could not have been\r\ndisposed of in a way less expected or more objectionable to himself,’\r\nwrote the Admiralty Solicitor, Jones, to McLeay, the secretary.\r\n\r\nBut Harman’s career was by no means ended. After serving on the\r\n_Enterprise_, he was sent to the _Namur_, guardship at the Nore, but for\r\na year or more a cloud of mystery enveloped him, and not until 1813 did\r\nit come out that he must have escaped from the _Namur_ very shortly\r\nafter his transfer, and that during the very next year, 1811, he was\r\nback at his old calling.\r\n\r\nA man giving the name of Nicholas Trelawney, but obviously a Frenchman,\r\nwas captured on August 24, 1811, on the Whitstable smack _Elizabeth_,\r\nlying in Broadstairs Roads, by the _Lion_ cutter. At his examination he\r\nconfessed that he was a prisoner who had broken parole from Tiverton,\r\nand got as far as Whitstable on July 4. Here he lodged at an inn where\r\nhe met Mr. ‘Feast’ of the hoy _Whitstable_. In conversation the\r\nFrenchman, not knowing, of course, who Mr. ‘Feast’ really was, described\r\nhimself as a Jerseyman who had a licence to take his boat to France, but\r\nshe had been seized by the Customs, as she had some English goods in\r\nher. He told ‘Feast’ that he much wanted to get to France, and ‘Feast’\r\npromised to help him, but without leading the Frenchman to suppose that\r\nhe knew him to be an escaped prisoner of war.\r\n\r\nHe paid ‘Feast’ £10 10_s._, and went on board the _Elizabeth_ to get to\r\nDeal, as being a more convenient port for France. ‘Feast’ warned him\r\nthat he would be searched, and persuaded him to hand over his watch and\r\n£18 for safe keeping. He saw nothing more of Mr. ‘Feast’ and was\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nWhen the above affair made it clear that Harman, alias Feast Moore, was\r\nat work again, a keen servant of the Transport Office, Mantell, the\r\nAgent at Dover, was instructed to get on to his track. Mantell found\r\nthat Harman had been at Broadstairs, to France, and in Dover, at which\r\nplace his well-known boat, the _Two Sisters_, was discovered, untenanted\r\nand with her name obliterated. Mantell further learned that on the very\r\nnight previous to his visit Harman had actually been landed by\r\nLieutenant Peace of the armed cutter _Decoy_, saying that he bore\r\nimportant dispatches from France for Croker at the Admiralty. The\r\nlieutenant had brought him ashore, and had gone with him to an inn\r\nwhence he would get a mail-coach to London. Mantell afterwards heard\r\nthat Harman went no farther than Canterbury.\r\n\r\nMantell described Harman’s usual mode of procedure: how, the French\r\nprisoners having been duly approached, the terms agreed upon, and the\r\nhorses, chaises, boats with sails, oars, charts and provisions arranged\r\nfor, he would meet them at a little distance outside their place of\r\nconfinement after dark, travel all night, and with good luck get them\r\noff within two days at the outside. Mantell found out that in August\r\n1811 Harman got four prisoners away from Crediton; he lived at Mr.\r\nParnell’s, the _White Lion_, St. Sidwell’s, under the name of Herbert,\r\nbought a boat of Mr. Owen of Topsham, and actually saw his clients safe\r\nover Exmouth bar.\r\n\r\nHis manner, said Mantell, was free and open; he generally represented\r\nhis clients to be Guernseymen, or _émigrés_, or Portuguese, and he\r\nalways got them to sign a paper of recommendation.\r\n\r\nIn July 1813 news came that Harman was at work in Kelso, Scotland. A\r\nstranger in that town had been seen furtively carrying a trunk to the\r\n_Cross Keys_ inn, from which he presently went in a post-chaise to\r\nLauder. He was not recognized, but frequent recent escapes from the town\r\nhad awakened the vigilance of the Agent, and the suspicious behaviour of\r\nthis stranger at the inn determined that official to pursue and arrest\r\nhim. The trunk was found to belong to Dagues, a French officer, and\r\ncontained the clothes of three other officers on parole, and from the\r\nfact that the stranger had made inquiries about a coach for Edinburgh,\r\nit was clear that an arrangement was nipped in the bud by which the\r\nofficers were to follow, pick up the trunk at Edinburgh, and get off\r\nfrom Leith.\r\n\r\nHarman was disguised, but the next morning the Kelso Agent saw at once\r\nthat he answered the description of him which had been circulated\r\nthroughout the kingdom, and sent him to Jedburgh Jail, while he\r\ncommunicated with London.\r\n\r\nThe result of Harman’s affair was that the Solicitor-General gave it as\r\nhis opinion that it was better he should be detained as a deserter from\r\nthe navy than as an aider of prisoners to escape, on the ground that\r\nthere were no sufficiently overt acts on the parts of the French\r\nprisoners to show an intention to escape! What became of Harman I cannot\r\ntrace, but at any rate he ceased to lead the fraternity of escape\r\nagents.\r\n\r\nWaddell, a Dymchurch smuggler, was second only to Harman as an extensive\r\nand successful escape agent. In 1812 he came to Moreton-Hampstead, ‘on\r\nbusiness’, and meeting one Robins, asked him if he was inclined to take\r\npart in a lucrative job, introducing himself, when in liquor afterwards\r\nat the inn, as the author of the escape of General Lefebvre-Desnouettes\r\nand wife from Cheltenham, for which he got £210, saying that while in\r\nFrance he engaged to get General Reynaud and his aide-de-camp away from\r\nMoreton-Hampstead for £300 or 300 guineas, which was the reason of his\r\npresence there. He added that he was now out on bail for £400 about the\r\naffair of Lefebvre-Desnouettes, and was bound to appear at Maidstone for\r\ntrial. If convicted he would only be heavily fined, so he was anxious to\r\nput this affair through.\r\n\r\nRobins agreed, but informed the Agent, and Waddell was arrested. As\r\nregards General Reynaud, above alluded to, that officer wrote to the\r\nTransport Office to say that the report of his intention to abscond was\r\nuntrue. The Office replied that it was glad to hear so, but added, ‘In\r\nconsequence of the very disgraceful conduct of other French officers of\r\nhigh rank, such reports cannot fail to be believed by many.’\r\n\r\nAs a rule the prisoners made their way to London, whence they went by\r\nhoy to Whitstable and across the Channel, but the route from Dymchurch\r\nto Wimereux was also much favoured. Spicer of Folkestone, Tom Gittens\r\n(known as Pork Pie Tom), James King, who worked the western ports; Kite,\r\nHornet, Cullen, Old Stanley, Hall, Waddle, and Stevenson of Folkestone;\r\nYates, Norris, Smith, Hell Fire Jack, old Jarvis and Bates of Deal;\r\nPiper and Allen of Dover; Jimmy Whather and Tom Scraggs of Whitstable,\r\nwere all reported to be ‘deep in the business’, and Deal was described\r\nas the ‘focus of mischief’. The usual charge of these men was £80 per\r\nhead, but, as has been already said, the fugitives ere they fairly set\r\nfoot on their native soil were usually relieved of every penny they\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nAn ugly feature about the practice of parole-breaking is that the most\r\ndistinguished French officers did not seem to regard it seriously. In\r\n1812 General Simon escaped from Odiham and corresponded with France; he\r\nwas recaptured, and sent to Tothill Fields Prison in London, and thence\r\nto Dumbarton Castle, where two rooms were furnished for him exactly on\r\nthe scale of a British field officer’s barrack apartment; he was placed\r\non the usual parole allowance, eighteenpence per day for himself, and\r\none shilling and threepence per day for a servant, and he resented very\r\nmuch having to give up a poniard in his possession. From Dumbarton he\r\nappears to have carried on a regular business as an agent for the escape\r\nof paroled prisoners, for, at his request, the Transport Office had\r\ngiven permission for two of his subalterns, also prisoners on parole,\r\nRaymond and Boutony by name, to take positions in London banks as French\r\ncorrespondents, and it was discovered that these men were actually\r\nacting as Simon’s London agents for the escape of prisoners on parole.\r\nIt was no doubt in consequence of this discovery that in 1813 orders\r\nwere sent to Dumbarton that not only was Simon to be deprived of\r\nnewspapers, but that he was not to be allowed pens and ink, ‘as he makes\r\nsuch a scandalous and unbecoming use of them.’\r\n\r\nIn May 1814 Simon, although he was still in close confinement, was\r\nexchanged for Major-General Coke, it being evidently considered by the\r\nGovernment that he could do less harm fighting against Britain than he\r\ndid as a prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe frequent breaches of parole by officers of distinction led to severe\r\ncomments thereon by the Transport Board, especially with regard to\r\nescapes. In a reply to General Privé, who had complained of being\r\nwatched with unnecessary rigour, it was said: ‘With reference to the\r\n“eternal vigilance” with which the officers on parole are watched, I am\r\ndirected to observe that there was a little necessity for this, as a\r\ngreat many Persons who style themselves Men of Honour, and some of them\r\nmembers of the Legion of Honour, have abandoned all Honour and Integrity\r\nby running from Parole, and by bribing unprincipled men to assist in\r\ntheir Escape.’\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Certain measures have been regarded as expedient in consequence of the\r\nvery frequent desertions of late of French officers, not even excepting\r\nthose of the highest rank, so that their Parole of Honour has become of\r\nlittle Dependence for their Security as Prisoners of War. Particularly\r\ndo we select General Lefebvre-Desnouettes, an officer of the Legion of\r\nHonour, a General of Division, Colonel commanding the Chasseurs à cheval\r\nde la Garde. He was allowed unusually great privileges on parole—to\r\nreside at Cheltenham, to go thence to Malvern and back to Cheltenham as\r\noften as he liked; his wife was allowed to reside with him, and he was\r\nallowed to have two Imperial Guardsmen as servants. Yet he absconded,\r\nMay 1, 1812, with his servants and naval lieutenant Armand le Duc, who\r\nhad been allowed as a special favour to live with him at Cheltenham.’\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Wellington requested that certain French officers should be given\r\ntheir parole, but in reply the Transport Office declined to consent, and\r\nas a reason sent him a list of 310 French officers who had broken their\r\nparole during the current year, 1812.\r\n\r\nThe _Moniteur_ of August 9, 1812, attempted to justify these breaches of\r\nparole, saying that Frenchmen only surrendered on the condition of\r\nretaining their arms, and that we had broken that condition.\r\n\r\nAt the Exeter Assizes, in the summer of 1812, Richard Tapper of\r\nMoreton-Hampstead, carrier, Thomas and William Vinnacombe of Cheriton\r\nBishop, smugglers, were convicted and sentenced to transportation for\r\nlife for aiding in the attempted escape of two merchant captains, a\r\nsecond captain of a privateer, and a midshipman from Moreton-Hampstead,\r\nfrom whom they had received £25 down and a promise of £150. They went\r\nunder Tapper’s guidance on horseback from Moreton to Topsham, where they\r\nfound the Vinnacombes waiting with a large boat. They started, but\r\ngrounded on the bar at Exmouth, and were captured.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, acting upon information, the Government officers\r\nslipped quietly down to Deal, Folkestone, and Sandgate, and seized a\r\nnumber of galleys built specially for the cross-Channel traffic of\r\nescaped prisoners. They were beautifully constructed, forty feet long,\r\neight-oared, and painted so as to be almost invisible. It was said that\r\nin calm weather they could be rowed across in _two hours_!\r\n\r\nThe pillory was an additional punishment for escape-aiders. Russel, in\r\nhis _History of Maidstone_, says that ‘the last persons who are\r\nremembered to have stood in the pillory were two men, who in the first\r\ndecade of the present (nineteenth) century, had assisted French\r\nprisoners of War to escape while on Parole’.\r\n\r\nBut I find that in 1812, seven men were condemned at Maidstone, in\r\naddition to two years’ imprisonment, to stand in the pillory on every\r\nmarket-day for a month, for the same offence. In this year, Hughes,\r\nlandlord of the _Red Lion_ and postmaster at Rye, Hatter, a fisherman,\r\nand Robinson, of Oswestry, were sentenced to two years in Horsham Jail,\r\nand in the first month to be pilloried on Rye Coast, _as near France as\r\npossible_, for aiding in the escape of General Phillipon and Lieutenant\r\nGarnier.\r\n\r\nMen, not regular escape agents, as well as the latter, often victimized\r\nthe poor Frenchmen under pretence of friendship.\r\n\r\nOne Whithair, of Tiverton, was accused, at the Exeter Summer Assizes of\r\n1812, by French prisoners of having cheated them. He had obtained £200\r\nfrom six officers on parole at Okehampton—he said to purchase a boat to\r\nget them off, and horses to carry them to the coast—through the medium\r\nof Madame Riccord, the English wife of one of the French officers.\r\nWhithair had also persuaded them to send their trunks to Tiverton in\r\nreadiness. They waited four months, and then suspected that Whithair was\r\ntricking them, and informed the Agent. Whithair was arrested, and\r\ncondemned to pay £200, and to be imprisoned until he did so. Later,\r\nWhithair humbly petitioned to be released from Newgate on the plea that\r\nduring his imprisonment he would have no chance of paying the fine, and\r\nthe Superintendent recommended it.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined that the profession of escape-aiding had much the\r\nsame fascination for adventurous spirits as had what our forefathers\r\ncalled ‘the highway’. So we read of a young gentleman of Rye, who,\r\nhaving run through a fortune, determined to make a trial of this career\r\nas a means of restoring his exchequer, but he was evidently too much of\r\nan amateur in a craft which required the exercise of a great many\r\nqualities not often found in one man’s composition. His very first\r\nventure was to get off two officers of high rank from Reading, for which\r\nhe was to receive three hundred guineas, half paid down. He got them in\r\na post-chaise as far as the inn at Johns Cross, Mountfield, about\r\nfourteen miles from Hastings, but here the Excise officers dropped upon\r\nthem, and there was an end of things.\r\n\r\nAt Ashbourne in Derbyshire, a young woman was brought up on March 13,\r\n1812, charged with aiding prisoners on parole to escape, and evidently\r\nthere had been hints about improper relationship between her and the\r\nFrenchmen, for she published the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘_To the Christian Impartial Reader._\r\n\r\n‘I the undernamed Susanna Cotton declares she has had nothing to do with\r\nthe escape of the French prisoners, although she has been remanded at\r\nStafford, and that there has been no improper relationship as rumoured.\r\n\r\n‘Judge not that ye be not judged. Parents of female children should not\r\nreadily believe a slander of their sex, nor should a male parent listen\r\nto the vulgar aggravation that too often attends the jocular whispering\r\nreport of a crime so important. For it is not known what Time, a year or\r\na day, may bring forth.\r\n\r\n‘Misses Lomas and Cotton take this opportunity (tho’ an unpleasant one)\r\nof returning their grateful acknowledgement of Public and Individual\r\nFavours conferred on them in their Business of Millinery, and hope for a\r\ncontinuance of them, and that they will not be withheld by reason of any\r\nPrejudices which may have arisen from the Slander above alluded to.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prosecution was withdrawn, although Miss Cotton’s denials were found\r\nto be untrue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n                     ESCAPES OF PRISONERS ON PAROLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of our forefathers during the eighteenth and early\r\nnineteenth centuries contained very many advertisements like the two\r\nfollowing. The first is from the _Western Flying Post_, of 1756, dated\r\nfrom Launceston, and offering Two Guineas reward for two officers, who\r\nhad broken their parole, and were thus described:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘One, Mons. Barbier, a short man, somewhat pock-marked, and has a very\r\ndejected look, and wore a snuff-coloured coat; the other, Mons. Beth, a\r\nmiddle-aged man, very strongly set, wore his own hair and a blue coat.\r\nThe former speaks no English, but the latter very well. They were both\r\nlast seen near Exeter, riding to that city.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second is from the London _Observer_ of April 21, 1811:\r\n\r\n\r\n     BREACH OF PAROLE OF HONOUR.—Transport Office, April 12, 1811.\r\n\r\n‘Whereas the two French Officers, Prisoners of War, named and described\r\nat the foot hereof, have absconded from Chesterfield in violation of\r\ntheir Parole of Honour; the Commissioners for conducting His Majesty’s\r\nTransport Service, etc., do hereby offer a Reward of Five Guineas for\r\nthe recapture of each of the said Prisoners, to any Person or Persons\r\nwho shall apprehend them, and deliver them at this office, or otherwise\r\ncause them to be safely lodged in any of the Public Gaols. Joseph\r\nExelman, General of Brigade, age 36, 5 feet 11½ inches high, stout, oval\r\nvisage, fresh complexion, light brown hair, blue eyes, strong features.\r\n\r\n‘Auguste de la Grange, Colonel, age 30, 6 feet high, stout, round\r\nvisage, fair complexion, brown hair, dark eyes, no mark in particular.’\r\n\r\n\r\nExcelmans was one of Bonaparte’s favourites. He and De la Grange induced\r\nJonas Lawton, an assistant to Doctor John Elam, the surgeon at\r\nChesterfield, to make the necessary arrangements for escape, and to\r\naccompany them. They left Chesterfield concealed in a covered cart, and\r\nsafely reached Paris. Here Lawton was liberally rewarded, and provided\r\nwith a good post as surgeon in a hospital, and retained the position\r\nlong after the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nMerely escaping from the parole town did not become frequent until it\r\nwas found necessary to abolish virtually the other method of returning\r\nto France which we allowed. By this, an officer on parole upon signing a\r\ndeclaration to the effect that unless he was exchanged for a British\r\nofficer of similar rank by a certain date he would return to England on\r\nthat date, was allowed to go to France, engaging, of course, not to\r\nserve against us. But when it became not a frequent but a universal rule\r\namong French officers to break their honour and actually to serve\r\nagainst us during their permitted absence, the Government was obliged to\r\nrefuse all applications, with the result that to escape from the parole\r\ntown became such a general practice as to call into existence that\r\nprofession of escape-aiding which was dealt with in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe case of Captain Jurien, now to be mentioned, is neither better nor\r\nworse than scores of others.\r\n\r\nOn December 10, 1803, the Transport Office wrote to him in Paris:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘As the time allowed for your absence from this Kingdom expired on\r\nNovember 22nd, and as Captain Brenton, R.N., now a prisoner of war in\r\nFrance, has not been released in exchange for you agreeably to our\r\nproposal, you are hereby required to return to this country according to\r\nthe terms of your Parole Agreement.’\r\n\r\n\r\nBut on March 16, 1804, Jurien had not returned. One result was that when\r\na Colonel Neraud applied to be sent to France upon his giving his word\r\nto have a British officer exchanged for him, the Transport Office\r\nreminded him that Jurien had been released on parole, August 22, 1803,\r\non the promise that he would return in three months, if not exchanged\r\nfor Captain Brenton, and that seven months had passed and he was still\r\naway. They added that the French Government had not released one British\r\nofficer in return for 500 French, who had been sent on parole to France,\r\nsome of whom, furthermore, in violation of their parole, were in arms\r\nagainst Britain. ‘Hence your detention is entirely owing to the action\r\nof your own Government.’\r\n\r\nAs time went on, and Jurien and the others did not return, the Transport\r\nOffice, weary of replying to the frequent applications of French\r\nofficers to go to France on parole, at last ceased to do so, with the\r\nresult that attempted escapes from parole places became frequent.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must not be understood that laxity of honour as\r\nregards parole obligation of this kind was universal. When in 1809 the\r\nTransport Office, in reply to a request by General Lefebvre to be\r\nallowed to go to France on parole, said that they could not accede\r\ninasmuch as no French officer thus privileged had been _allowed_ to\r\nreturn, they italicized the word ‘allowed’, and cited the case of\r\nGeneral Frescinet, ‘who made most earnest but ineffectual Intreaty to be\r\nallowed to fulfil the Parole d’Honneur’ he had entered into, by\r\nreturning to this country.\r\n\r\nThame seems to have been a particularly turbulent parole town, and one\r\nfrom which escapes were more than usually numerous. One case was\r\npeculiar. Four prisoners who had been recaptured after getting away\r\njustified their attempt by accusing Smith, the Agent, of ill-behaviour\r\ntowards them. Whereupon the other prisoners at Thame, among them\r\nVillaret-Joyeuse, testified against them, and in favour of Smith.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of Baron Le Jeune are among the most interesting, and\r\nhis case is peculiar inasmuch as although he was nominally a prisoner on\r\nparole, he was not so in fact, so that his escape involved no breach. In\r\n1811 he was taken prisoner by Spanish brigands, who delivered him to the\r\nEnglish garrison at Merida. Here he was treated as a guest by\r\nMajor-General Sir William Lumley and the officers, and when he sailed\r\nfor England on H.M.S. _Thetis_ he had a state-cabin, and was regarded as\r\na distinguished passenger. On arriving at Portsmouth his anxiety was as\r\nto whether the hulks were to be his fate. ‘And our uneasiness\r\nincreased’, he writes in the _Memoirs_, whence the following story is\r\ntaken, ‘when we passed some twenty old vessels full of French prisoners,\r\nmost of them wearing only yellow vests, whilst others were perfectly\r\nnaked. At this distressing sight I asked the captain if he was taking us\r\nto the hulks. To which he replied with a frown: “Yes, just as a matter\r\nof course.” At the same moment our boat drew up alongside the _San\r\nAntonio_, an old 80–gun ship. We ascended the side, and there, to our\r\nhorror, we saw some five to six hundred French prisoners, who were but\r\none-third of those on board, climbing on to each other’s shoulders, in\r\nthe narrow space in which they were penned, to have a look at the\r\nnewcomers, of whose arrival they seemed to have been told. Their\r\nsilence, their attitude, and the looks of compassion they bestowed on me\r\nas I greeted them _en passant_ seemed to me omens of a terrible future\r\nfor me.’\r\n\r\nThe captain of the hulk apologized to the baron for having no better\r\naccommodation. Le Jeune, incredulous, made him repeat it, and flew into\r\na rage. He snatched a sword from an Irishman and swore he would kill any\r\none who would keep him on a hulk. The French prisoners shouted: ‘Bravo!\r\nIf every one behaved as you do, the English would not dare treat us so!’\r\n\r\nThe captain of the hulk was alarmed at the possible result of this with\r\n1,500 desperate prisoners, and hurried the baron into his boat.\r\n\r\nThus Baron Le Jeune escaped the hulks!\r\n\r\nHe was then taken to the Forton Dépôt, where he remained three days, and\r\nwas then ordered to Ashby-de-la-Zouch. So rapidly was he hurried into a\r\ncoach that he had not time to sign his parole papers and resolved to\r\nprofit by the omission. He passed many days on a very pleasant journey\r\nvia Andover and Blenheim, for he paused to see all that was interesting\r\non the way, and even went to theatres. He found about a hundred French\r\nprisoners at Ashby (some of whom, he says, had been there fifteen\r\nyears!), and reported himself to the Agent, Farnell, a grocer,\r\n‘certainly the tallest, thinnest, most cadaverous seller of dry goods in\r\nthe world.’\r\n\r\nAt Ashby he found old friends, and passed his time with them, and in\r\nlearning English. He was invited to Lord Hastings’ house about a mile\r\nfrom Ashby. Hastings was brother to Lord Moira, a friend of the Prince\r\nof Wales, and here he met the orphan daughter of Sir John Moore. He was\r\nmost kindly treated, and Lord Hastings said he would try to get leave\r\nfor him to live in London.\r\n\r\nThen came a change.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A man came to me one morning, and said to me privately that the Duke of\r\nRovigo, minister of Police in France, authorized by the Emperor, had\r\nsent him to propose to me that I should let him arrange for me to get\r\nout of England, and return to France. I distrusted him, for I had heard\r\nof the tricks of escape Agents, and said I would first consult my\r\nfriend, Colonel Stoffel. I did so. Stoffel said it was a _bonâ fide_\r\noffer, but the emissary had brought no money with him, and it would cost\r\nprobably 200 guineas.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was the baron to get such a sum? He went to Baudins, a merchant,\r\nand asked him for a loan, and at a ball that night Baudins signalled\r\nthat the loan was all right. Farnell was at the ball, and the baron\r\ndescribes his comical assumption of dignity as the guardian of the\r\nFrench prisoners. Baudins lent Baron Le Jeune the money in gold without\r\nasking interest on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I was invited to a grand dinner by General Hastings the very evening we\r\nwere to start, and I duly appeared at it. The evening passed very\r\nbrightly, and at dessert, after the ladies had retired, the men remained\r\nbehind to drink wine together, beginning with a toast to the ladies. As\r\na matter of taste, as well as of design, I kept my head clear, and when\r\nmy companions were sufficiently exhilarated by the fumes of the claret\r\nthey had drunk, they returned with somewhat unsteady steps to the\r\ndrawing-room, where tea had been prepared by the ladies.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe baron won the goodwill of all and was invited to return the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAt 11 p.m., it being very dark, he slipped out through the park to meet\r\nColonel Stoffel and a guide. He waited an hour, but at last they arrived\r\nin a post-chaise, and they drove off. Passing through Northants, North\r\nMiddlesex [_sic_], London, and Reigate, they came to Hythe, where they\r\nstopped the next night. They pretended to be invalids come for a course\r\nof sea baths, and the baron was actually assisted out of the carriage by\r\nCustom-house officers. The chaise dismissed, tea was ordered while the\r\nguide went to make inquiries about Folkestone. He returned with a\r\nhorror-struck face, and wrote on a slate: ‘Pay at once and let us be\r\noff.’ Le Jeune gave the girl of the house a guinea, and told her to keep\r\nthe change, which made her look suspicious, as if the money had not been\r\nhonestly come by. No time was to be lost, for Hythe was full of troops.\r\nThe guide advised the baron to drop the erect bearing of a soldier, and\r\nassume a stoop. They got away, and hid in a wheat-field during the day\r\nwhile the guide again went into Folkestone. He was away seventeen hours.\r\nAt length they got to Folkestone, and Le Jeune was introduced to a\r\nsmuggler named Brick, a diabolical-looking man, who said he would take\r\nthem safely over to France.\r\n\r\nBrick asked the Baron for 200 guineas, and got them. The wind was\r\ncontrary, he said, but he would lodge them well. A decent room was hired\r\nwith a trap-door under the bed for escape, and here they remained\r\nthirteen days. Le Jeune became impatient, and at last resolved to risk\r\nweather and everything else and go. ‘Well! follow me! like the others!’\r\ngrowled Brick ferociously to the sailor with him. But the woman of the\r\nhouse implored Le Jeune and Stoffel not to go with Brick: they remained\r\ndetermined, but she persisted and held them back, and so, now persuaded\r\nthat she had good reasons for her action, and she seeming a decent body,\r\nthey remained. Later on they learned how close to danger they had been,\r\nfor the woman told them that Brick had taken the money of a score of\r\nfugitives like themselves, promising to land them in France, hiding them\r\nunder nets to avoid the coast-guard, and as soon as they were well out,\r\nmurdering them and flinging their bodies overboard with stones tied to\r\nthem, knowing that transportation awaited him if he was caught aiding\r\nprisoners to escape.\r\n\r\nThey asked the woman to help them, for now they had no money. The baron\r\ntold the sailor that he would give him fifty livres at Boulogne, if he\r\nlanded them there. He was an honest fellow, brought them a sailor’s\r\nclothes, and went along the beach with them, replying, ‘Fishermen’ to\r\nthe many challenges they got. Finding a small boat, they shoved it off,\r\nand got in, so as to board a fishing-smuggling smack riding outside. It\r\nwas a foul night, and three times they were hurled back ashore, wet to\r\nthe skin; so they returned. The next day the weather moderated and they\r\ngot off, under the very lee of a police boat, which they deceived by\r\npretending to get nets out. In six hours they were within sight of\r\nBoulogne, but were obliged to keep off or they would be fired upon,\r\nuntil they had signalled and were told to come in.\r\n\r\nAt this time England sent by smugglers a quantity of incendiary\r\npamphlets which the French coast-guard had orders to seize, so that Le\r\nJeune and Stoffel were searched and, guarded by armed men, marched to\r\nthe Commissary of Police, ‘just as if’, Le Jeune said, ‘we were infected\r\nwith the plague.’\r\n\r\nLuckily, the Commissary was an old friend of the baron, so they had no\r\nfurther trouble, but paid the sailor his fifty livres, and went to\r\nParis. At an interview with the Emperor, the latter said to Le Jeune,\r\n‘And did you see Lefebvre-Desnouettes?’\r\n\r\n‘No, sire, but I wrote to him. He is extremely anxious to get back to\r\nyou, and is beginning to lose hope of being exchanged. He would do as I\r\nhave done if he were not afraid of your Majesty’s displeasure.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! Let him come! Let him come! I shall be very glad to see him,’ said\r\nthe Emperor.\r\n\r\n‘Does your Majesty give me leave to tell him so in your name?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, yes. Don’t lose any time.’\r\n\r\nSo Madame Lefebvre-Desnouettes got a passport, and went over to England,\r\nand her presence did much to distract the attention of the general’s\r\nguardians, and made his escape comparatively easy. The general, as a\r\nGerman or Russian Count, Madame in boy’s clothes as his son, and an\r\nA.D.C. got up as a valet-de-chambre, went in a post-chaise from\r\nCheltenham to London, where they rested for a couple of hours at\r\nSablonière’s in Leicester Square, then at midnight left for Dover and\r\nthence to Paris.\r\n\r\nGeneral Osten, second in command at Flushing, on parole at Lichfield,\r\nwas another gentleman who was helped to get off by a lady member of his\r\nfamily. His daughter had come with him from Flushing, and in December\r\n1809 went away with all her father’s heavy baggage. In February 1810,\r\nWaddell, the escape agent, met the general and two other officers in\r\nBirmingham, and forty-six hours later landed with them in Holland.\r\n\r\nIn this year, 1810, the escapes were so numerous by boats stolen from\r\nthe shores that the Admiralty issued a warning that owners of boats on\r\nbeaches should not leave masts, oars, and tackle in them, and in 1812\r\ncompensation was refused to a Newton Abbot and to a Paignton fisherman,\r\nbecause prisoners had stolen their boats, which had been left with their\r\ngear on the beach, despite warning, and when the prisoners were\r\nrecaptured it was found that they had destroyed the boats.\r\n\r\nIn October 1811, six French officers—Bouquet, army surgeon, Leclerc,\r\nlieutenant of hussars, Denguiard, army surgeon, Jean Henry, ‘passenger’\r\non privateer, Gaffé, merchant skipper, and Glenat, army lieutenant,\r\nunder the guidance of one Johns, left Okehampton, crossed the moor to\r\nBovey Tracey, where they met a woman of whom they asked the way to\r\nTorbay. She replied, and while they consulted together, gave the alarm\r\nso that the villagers turned out and caught three of the runaways. The\r\nother three ran and were pursued. Johns turned on the foremost pursuer\r\nand stabbed him so that he died, and two others were wounded by the\r\nFrenchmen, but the latter were caught at Torquay. Johns got off, but on\r\nNovember 2 was seen at Chesterfield, where he got work on a Saturday;\r\ninstead of going to it on Monday morning, however, he decamped, and was\r\nseen on the Manchester road, eight miles from Chesterfield. In 1812 a\r\nman named Taylor, of Beer Alston, said to be Johns, was arrested, but\r\nproved an alibi and was discharged.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 General Maurin, who may be remembered in connexion with the\r\nCrapper trouble at Wantage, escaped with his brother from Abergavenny,\r\nwhither he had been sent, the smuggler Waddell being paid £300 for his\r\nhelp. At the same time General Brou escaped from Welshpool. Both these\r\nofficers had been treated with particular leniency and had been allowed\r\nunusual privileges, so that the Transport Office comments with great\r\nseverity upon their behaviour.\r\n\r\nOn November 8, 1812, a girl named Mary Clarke went in very foggy weather\r\nfrom Wolverhampton to Bridgnorth to meet a friend. She waited for some\r\ntime, but he did not come; so she turned back towards her inn, where her\r\nchaise was waiting. Here was Lieutenant Montbazin, a French naval\r\nofficer, who had broken his parole from Lichfield, who politely accosted\r\nher and asked her if she was going to Wolverhampton. She replied that\r\nshe was. Was she going to walk? No; she had her chaise. Would she let\r\nhim have a seat if he paid half expenses? She agreed, and went back for\r\nthe chaise while he walked on, and she picked him up half a mile on,\r\nbetween some rocks by the roadside. So they went on to Wolverhampton—and\r\nto Birmingham. In the meantime he had been missed at Lichfield, and\r\nfollowed, and in the back parlour of the _Swan_ at Birmingham was\r\narrested with the girl.\r\n\r\nThis was Mary Clarke’s evidence in court.\r\n\r\nIn defence, Montbazin said that he had been exchanged for four British\r\nseamen, who had been landed from France, but that the Transport Office\r\nhad refused to let him go, so he had considered himself absolved from\r\nhis parole.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the girl’s story was concocted, that\r\nher meeting with Montbazin was part of a prearranged plan, and the Court\r\nemphasized their opinion that this was the case by sending the\r\nlieutenant to a prison afloat, and Mary Clarke to one ashore.\r\n\r\nIn October 1812, eight French officers left Andover quietly in the\r\nevening, and, a mile out, met two mounted escape-aiders. Behind each of\r\nthem a prisoner mounted, and all proceeded at a walk for six miles, when\r\nthey met another man with three horses. On these horses the remaining\r\nsix prisoners mounted, and by daybreak were at Ringwood, thirty-six\r\nmiles on their road to liberty. All the day they remained hidden in the\r\nforest, living upon bread, cheese, and rum, which their guides procured\r\nfrom Ringwood. At nightfall they restarted, passed through Christchurch\r\nto Stanpit, and thence to the shore, where they found a boat waiting for\r\nthem; but the wind being contrary and blowing a gale, they could not\r\nembark, and were obliged to remain hidden in the woods for three days,\r\nsuffering so much from exposure and want that they made a bargain with a\r\nMrs. Martin to lodge in her house for £12 until the weather should\r\nmoderate sufficiently for them to embark. They stayed here for a week,\r\nand then their suspense and anxiety, they knowing that the hue and cry\r\nwas after them, became unbearable, and they gave the smuggler-skipper of\r\nthe _Freeholder_ a promissory note for six hundred guineas to hazard\r\ntaking them off. He made the attempt, but the vessel was driven ashore,\r\nand the Frenchmen were with difficulty landed at another spot on the\r\ncoast; here they wandered about in the darkness and storm, until one of\r\nthem becoming separated from the others gave himself up, and the\r\ndiscovery of his companions soon followed.\r\n\r\nThe result of the trial was that the officers were, of course, sent to\r\nthe hulks, the master of the _Freeholder_ was transported for life, four\r\nof his men for seven years, and the _aiders acquitted_. This appears\r\ncurious justice, which can only be explained by presuming that the\r\nmagistrates, or rather the Admiralty, often found it politic to get\r\nescape-aiders into their service in this way.\r\n\r\nOf course, all ‘escapes’ were bad offences from an honourable point of\r\nview, but some were worse than others. For instance, in 1812, the Duc de\r\nChartres wrote a strong letter of intercession to the Transport Office\r\non behalf of one Du Baudiez. This man had been sent to Stapleton Prison\r\nfor having broken his parole at Odiham, and the duke asked that his\r\nparole should be restored him. The Transport Office decidedly rejected\r\nthe application, and in their reply to the duke quoted a letter written\r\nby Du Baudiez to his sister in France in which he says that he has given\r\nhis creditors in Odiham bills upon her, but asks her not to honour them,\r\nbecause ‘Les Anglais nous ont agonis de sottises, liés comme des bêtes\r\nsauvages, et traités toute la route comme des chiens. Ce sont des\r\nAnglais; rien ne m’étonne de ce qu’ils ont fait ... ce sont tous des\r\ngueux, des scélérats depuis le premier jusqu’au dernier. Aussi je vous\r\nprie en grâce de protester ces billets ... je suis dans la ferme\r\nrésolution de ne les point payer.’\r\n\r\nOn one occasion an unexpected catch of ‘broke-paroles’ was made. The\r\nRevenue Officers believed that two men who were playing cards in an inn\r\nnear Canterbury were escaped prisoners, and at 8 p.m. called on a\r\nmagistrate to get help. The magistrate told them that it was of no use\r\nto get the constable, as at that hour he was usually intoxicated, but\r\nauthorized them to get the military.\r\n\r\nThis they did, but the landlord refused to open the door and, during the\r\nparleying, two men slipped out by the back door, whom the officers\r\nstopped, and presently two others, who were also stopped. All four were\r\nFrench ‘broke-paroles’ from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and the card-players\r\nwithin were not prisoners at all. The captured men said that on\r\nBeckenham Common they had nearly been caught, for the driver of the cart\r\nstopped there at 10 p.m. to rest the horse. The horse-patrol, passing\r\nby, ordered him to move on. As he was putting the horse to, the\r\nFrenchmen, all being at the back of the cart, tilted it up and cried\r\nout. However, the horse-patrol had passed on and did not hear.\r\n\r\nIn the two next cases English girls play a part. In 1814 Colonel Poerio\r\nescaped from Ashbourne with an English girl in male attire, but they\r\nwere captured at Loughborough. At the trial an Ashbourne woman said that\r\none day a girl came and asked for a lodging, saying that she was a\r\nworker at ‘lace-running’; she seemed respectable, and was taken in, and\r\nremained some days without causing any suspicion, although she seemed on\r\ngood terms with the French prisoners on parole in the town. One evening\r\nthe woman’s little girl met the lodger coming downstairs, and said:\r\n‘Mam! _she_ has got a black coat on!’ When asked where she was going,\r\nshe replied, ‘To Colonel Juliett’s. Will be back in five minutes.’\r\n(Colonel Juliett was another prisoner.) She did not return, and that was\r\nthe last witness saw of her.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, the girl said that she kept company with Poerio, but\r\nas her father did not approve of her marrying him she had resolved to\r\nelope. She took with her £5, which she had saved by ‘running’ lace. They\r\nwere arrested at the _Bull’s Head_, Loughborough, where the girl had\r\nordered a chaise. Counsel decided that there was no case for\r\nprosecution!\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this Colonel Poerio is identical with the man of that\r\nname who, in 1812, when on a Chatham hulk, applied to be put on parole,\r\nthe answer being a refusal, inasmuch as he was a man of infamous\r\ncharacter, and that when in command of the island of Cerigo he had\r\npoisoned the water there in order to relieve himself of some 600\r\nAlbanian men, women, and children, many of whom died—a deed he\r\nacknowledged himself by word and in writing.\r\n\r\nColonel Ocher in 1811 got off from Lichfield with a girl, was pursued by\r\nofficers in a chaise and four, and was caught at Meriden, on the\r\nCoventry road, about two miles beyond Stone Bridge. Upon examination,\r\nAnn Green, spinster, lodging at 3, Newman Street, Oxford Street, London,\r\nsaid that she came to Birmingham by the ‘Balloon’ coach, according to\r\ninstructions she had received from a Baron Ferriet, whom she knew. He\r\nhad given her £6, paid her fare, and sent her to the _Swan with two\r\nNecks_ in Ladd Lane, where she was given a letter, which, as she could\r\nnot read, the waiter read to her. The letter told her to go to Lichfield\r\nto the _St. George_ hotel, as the baron had business to attend to which\r\nkept him in London. At the Lichfield hotel there was a letter which told\r\nher to go to Mr. Joblin’s, where Colonel Ocher lodged. Here she left\r\nword she would meet him in the fields, which she did at 9 p.m., when\r\nthey went off, and were captured as above.\r\n\r\nIn defence, ‘Baron Ferriet’ told a strange story. He said he had been in\r\nthe British Secret Service in France. He lived there in constant danger\r\nas there was a reward of 40,000 francs offered for him by the French\r\nGovernment. At Sables d’Olonne, Colonel Ocher’s family had hidden him\r\nwhen the authorities were after him, and had saved him, and Madame Ocher\r\nhad looked after his wife and family. So, in a long letter he explains\r\nin very fair English that he determined to repay the Ochers in France\r\nfor their kindness to him by procuring the escape of General Ocher, a\r\nprisoner on parole in England, and regarded him as ‘his property’.\r\n\r\nAlthough the prisoners on parole had no lack of English sympathizers,\r\nespecially if they could pay, a large section of the lower class of\r\ncountry folk were ever on the alert to gain the Government reward for\r\nthe detection and prevention of parole-breaking. The following is a\r\nsample of letters frequently received by the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office and\r\nits agents:\r\n\r\n\r\n ‘MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n‘This informs your lordships that on ye 30th July 1780, I was on\r\nOkehampton road leading to Tavistock, saw four French prisoners, on\r\nhorseback without a guide. They signified to me that they had leave to\r\ngo to Tavistock from there company at Okehampton. After I was past\r\nTavistock four miles they came galloping on towards Buckland Down Camp.\r\nI kept in sight of them and perceived them to ride several miles or\r\nabove out of the Turnpike Road taking of what view they could of\r\nGentlemen’s seats, and ye Harbour and Sound and Camp, and I thought\r\nwithin myself it was very strange that these profest Enemies should be\r\ngranted such Libertys as this, by any Company whatever. Accordingly came\r\nto a Resolution as soon as they came within the lines of the Camp ride\r\nforward and stopt them and applyd to the Commanding Officer which was\r\nMajor Braecher of the Bedfordshire Militia, who broke their letter, and\r\nnot thinking it a proper Passport the Major ordered them under the care\r\nof the Quarter Guard.\r\n\r\n[Winds up with a claim for reward.]\r\n\r\n                                                  ‘JOSEPH GILES,\r\n                                          ‘Near ye P.O., Plymouth Dock.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt turned out in this case that the Agent at Okehampton had given the\r\nFrenchmen permission to go to Tavistock for their trunks, so they were\r\nreleased and returned. The ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office said that to allow\r\nthese prisoners to ride unguarded to Tavistock was most improper, and\r\nmust, under no circumstances, be allowed to occur again.\r\n\r\nFrom a paper read by Mr. Maberley Phillips, F.S.A., before the Newcastle\r\nSociety of Antiquaries, I take the following instances of escapes of\r\nparole prisoners in the North.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 there were on parole at Jedburgh under the Agent, George Bell,\r\nabout a hundred French prisoners. At the usual Saturday muster-call on\r\nJune I, all were present, but at that of June 4, Benoît Poulet and\r\nJacques Girot were missing. From the evidence at the trial of the\r\naccomplices in this escape, all of whom except the chief agent, James\r\nHunter of Whitton, near Rothbury, were arrested, and three of whom\r\nturned King’s evidence, the story was unfolded of the flight of the\r\nmen—who were passed off as Germans on a fishing excursion—across the\r\nwild, romantic, historic fell-country between the Border and Alwinton on\r\nthe Coquet; and so by Whitton, Belsay, and Ponteland, to the _Bird in\r\nBush_ inn, Pilgrim Street, Newcastle; whence the Frenchmen were supposed\r\nto have gone to Shields, and embarked in a foreign vessel for France.\r\n\r\nI quote this and the following case as instances of the general sympathy\r\nof English country people with the foreign prisoners amongst them. The\r\n_Courant_ of August 28, 1813, says: ‘The trial of James Hunter occupied\r\nthe whole of Monday, and the court was excessively crowded; when the\r\nverdict of Not Guilty was delivered, clapping of hands and other noisy\r\nsymptoms of applause were exhibited, much to the surprise of the judge,\r\nSir A. Chambers, who observed that he seemed to be in an assembly of\r\nFrenchmen, rather than in an English court of justice. The other\r\nprisoners charged with the same offence, were merely arraigned, and the\r\nverdict of acquittal was recorded without further trial.’\r\n\r\nHunter had been arrested in Scotland, just before the trial. Quoting\r\nfrom Wallace’s _History of Blyth_, Mr. Phillips says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘One Sunday morning in the year 1811, the inhabitants were thrown into a\r\nstate of great excitement by the startling news that five Frenchmen had\r\nbeen taken during the night and were lodged in the guard-house. They\r\nwere officers who had broken their parole at Edinburgh Castle [?\r\nJedburgh], and in making their way home had reached the neighbourhood of\r\nBlyth; when discovered, they were resting by the side of the Plessy\r\nwagon-way beside the “Shoulder of Mutton” field.\r\n\r\n‘A party of countrymen who had been out drinking, hearing some persons\r\nconversing in an unknown tongue, suspected what they were, and\r\ndetermined to effect their capture. The fugitives made some resistance,\r\nbut in the end were captured, and brought to Blyth, and given into the\r\ncharge of the soldiers then quartered in the town. _This act of the\r\ncountrymen met with the strongest reprobation of the public_’ (the\r\nitalics are mine). ‘The miscarriage of the poor fellows’ plan of escape\r\nthrough the meddling of their captors, excited the sympathy of the\r\ninhabitants; rich and poor vying with each other in showing kindness to\r\nthe strangers. Whatever was likely to alleviate their helpless condition\r\nwas urged upon their acceptance; victuals they did not refuse, but\r\nthough money was freely offered them, they steadily refused to accept\r\nit. The guard-house was surrounded all day long by crowds anxious to get\r\na glimpse of the captives. The men who took the prisoners were rewarded\r\nwith £5 each, but doubtless it would be the most unsatisfactory wages\r\nthey ever earned, for long after, whenever they showed their faces in\r\nthe town, they had to endure the upbraiding of men, women, and children;\r\nindeed, it was years before public feeling about this matter passed\r\naway.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe continuance and frequency of escapes by prisoners on parole\r\nnecessitated increased rigidity of regulations. The routes by which\r\nprisoners were marched from place to place were exactly laid down, and\r\nwe find numberless letters of instruction from the Transport Office like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Colonel X having received permission to reside on parole at\r\nAshby-de-la-Zouch, his route from Chatham is to be: Chatham, Sevenoaks,\r\nCroydon, Kingston, Uxbridge, Wendover, Buckingham, Towcester, Daventry,\r\nand Coleshill.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instructions to conductors of prisoners were as follows:\r\n\r\nPrisoners were to march about twelve miles a day. Conductors were to pay\r\nthe prisoners sixpence per day per man before starting. Conductors were\r\nto ride ahead of prisoners, so as to give notice at towns of their\r\ncoming, and were to see that the prisoners were not imposed upon.\r\nConductors (who were always mounted), were to travel thirty miles a day\r\non the return journey, and to halt upon Sundays.\r\n\r\nOf course, it was in the power of the conductors to make the journeys of\r\nthe prisoners comfortable or the reverse. If the former, it was the\r\nusual custom to give a certificate of this kind:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘_April 1798._ This is to certify that Mr. Thomas Willis, conductor of\r\n134 Dutch and Spanish prisoners of war from the _Security_ prison ship\r\nat Chatham, into the custody of Mr. Barker, agent for prisoners of war\r\nat Winchester, has provided us with good lodgings every night, well\r\nlittered with straw, and that we have been regularly paid our\r\nsubsistence every morning on our march, each prisoner sixpence per day\r\naccording to the established allowance.\r\n\r\n                                                             ‘(Signed).’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ill-treatment of prisoners on the march was not usual, and when\r\nreported was duly punished. Thus in 1804 a Coldstream guardsman on\r\nescort of prisoners from Reading to Norman Cross, being convicted of\r\nrobbing a prisoner, was sentenced to 600 lashes, and the sentence was\r\npublicly read out at all the dépôts.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 posters came out offering the usual reward for the arrest of an\r\nofficer who had escaped from a Scottish parole town, and distinguished\r\nhim as lacking three fingers of his left hand. A year later Bow Street\r\nofficers Vickary and Lavender, ‘from information received’, followed a\r\nseller of artificial flowers into a public-house in ‘Weston Park,\r\nLincolns Inn Fields.’ The merchant bore the distinctive mark of the\r\nwanted foreigner, and, seeing that the game was up, candidly admitted\r\nhis identity, said that he had lived in London during the past twelve\r\nmonths by making and selling artificial flowers, and added that he had\r\nlost his fingers for his country, and would not mind losing his head for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIn the same year a militia corporal who had done duty at a prisoner\r\ndépôt, and so was familiar with foreign faces, saw two persons in a\r\nchaise driving towards Worcester, whom he at once suspected to be\r\nescaped prisoners. He stopped the chaise, and made the men show their\r\npassports, which were not satisfactory, and, although they tried to\r\nbribe him to let them go, he refused, mounted the bar of the chaise, and\r\ndrove on. One of the men presently opened the chaise-door with the aim\r\nof escaping, but the corporal presented a pistol at him, and he\r\nwithdrew. At Worcester they confessed that they had escaped from\r\nBishop’s Castle, and said they were Trafalgar officers.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 prisoners broke their parole in batches. From Tiverton at one\r\ntime, twelve; from Andover, eight (as recorded on pp. 384–5); from\r\nWincanton, ten; and of these, four were generals and eighteen colonels.\r\n\r\nIn the _Quarterly Review_, December 1821, the assertion made by M.\r\nDupin, in his report upon the treatment of French prisoners in Britain,\r\npublished in 1816, and before alluded to in the chapter upon\r\nprison-ships, that French officers observed their parole more faithfully\r\nthan did English, was shown to be false. Between May 1803, and August\r\n1811, 860 French officers had attempted to escape from parole towns. Of\r\nthese, 270 were recaptured, and 590 escaped. In 1808 alone, 154 escaped.\r\nFrom 1811 to 1814, 299 army officers escaped, and of this number 9 were\r\ngenerals, 18 were colonels, 14 were lieutenant-colonels, 8 were majors,\r\n91 were captains, and 159 were lieutenants. It should be noted that in\r\nthis number are not included the many officers who practically\r\n‘escaped’, in that they did not return to England when not exchanged at\r\nthe end of their term of parole.\r\n\r\nFrom the Parliamentary Papers of 1812, I take the following table:\r\n\r\n                                        Transport Office, June 25, 1812.\r\n\r\n ──────────────────┬────────┬────────┬─────────┬──────────┬─────────────────────\r\n                   │ _Total │        │         │          │\r\n                   │No. Com.│  _No.  │         │          │\r\n                   │Officers│  that  │         │          │\r\n                   │   on   │ broke  │  _Been  │          │\r\n                   │parole._│parole._│retaken._│_Escaped._│\r\n ──────────────────┼────────┼────────┼─────────┼──────────┼─────────────────────\r\n Year ending 5th   │        │        │         │          │N.B.

DOUGLAS.\r\n ──────────────────┴────────┴────────┴─────────┴──────────┴─────────────────────\r\n\r\nDuring the above-quoted period, between 1803 and 1811, out of 20,000\r\nBritish _détenus_, not prisoners of war, in France, it cannot be shown\r\nthat more than twenty-three broke their parole, and even these are\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nSometimes the epidemic of parole-breaking was severe enough to render\r\ndrastic measures necessary. In 1797 orders were issued that all French\r\nprisoners, without distinction of rank, were to be placed in close\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, in consequence of invasion alarms, it was deemed advisable to\r\nremove all prisoners from the proximity of the coast to inland towns,\r\nthe Admiralty order being:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘At the present conjunction all parole prisoners from the South and West\r\ntowns are to be sent to North Staffordshire, and Derbyshire—that is, to\r\nChesterfield, Ashbourne, and Leek.’\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Morgan at Bishop’s Waltham resented this removal so far away, in\r\na letter to the Transport Office, to which they replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘This Board has uniformly wished to treat Prisoners of War with every\r\ndegree of humanity consistent with the public safety: but in the present\r\ncircumstances it has been judged expedient to remove all Prisoners of\r\nWar on Parole from places near the Coast to Inland towns. You will\r\ntherefore observe that the order is not confined to you, but relates\r\ngenerally to all Prisoners on Parole: and with regard to your comparison\r\nof the treatment of prisoners in this country with that of British\r\nprisoners in France, the Commissioners think it only necessary to remark\r\nthat the distance to which it is now proposed to remove you does not\r\nexceed 170 miles, whereas British prisoners in France are marched into\r\nthe interior to a distance of 500 miles from some of the ports into\r\nwhich they are carried.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgan was allowed eventually his choice of Richmond or Barnet as a\r\nplace of parole, a privilege accorded him because of his kindness to a\r\nMr. Hurry, during the detention of the latter as a prisoner in France.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, so many prisoners escaped from Wincanton that all the parole\r\nprisoners in the place were marched to London to be sent thence by sea\r\nto Scotland for confinement. ‘Sudden and secret measures’ were taken to\r\nremove them, all of the rank of captain and above, to Forton for\r\nembarkation, except General Houdetôt, who was sent to Lichfield. From\r\nOkehampton sixty were sent to Ilfracombe, and thence to Swansea for\r\nAbergavenny, and from Bishop’s Waltham to Oswestry in batches of twelve\r\nat intervals of three days.\r\n\r\nMany parole towns petitioned for the retention of the prisoners, but all\r\nwere refused; the inhabitants of some places in Devon attempted to\r\ndetain prisoners for debts; and Enchmarsh, the Agent at Tiverton, was\r\nsuspended for not sending off his prisoners according to orders. Their\r\ndeparture was the occasion in many places for public expressions of\r\nregret, and this can be readily appreciated when it is considered what\r\nthe residence of two or three hundred young men, some of whom were of\r\ngood family and many of whom had private means, in a small English\r\ncountry town meant, not merely from a business but from a social point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nIn _The Times_ of 1812 may be read that a French officer, who had been\r\nexchanged and landed at Morlaix, and had expressed disgust at the\r\nfrequent breaches of parole by his countrymen, was arrested and shot by\r\norder of Bonaparte. I merely quote this as an example that even British\r\nnewspapers of standing were occasionally stooping to the vituperative\r\nlevel of their trans-Channel _confrères_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n                        COMPLAINTS OF PRISONERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be expected that a uniform standard of good and\r\nsubmissive behaviour would be attained by a large body of fighting men,\r\nthe greater part of whom were in vigorous youth or in the prime of life,\r\nalthough, on the whole, the conduct of those who honourably observed\r\ntheir parole seems to have been admirable—a fact which no doubt had a\r\ngreat deal to do with the very general display of sympathy for them\r\nlatterly. In some places more than others they seem to have brought upon\r\nthemselves by their own behaviour local odium, and these are the places\r\nin which were quartered captured privateer officers, wild, reckless\r\nsea-dogs whom, naturally, restraint galled far more deeply than it did\r\nthe drilled and disciplined officers of the regular army and navy.\r\n\r\nIn 1797, for instance, the inhabitants of Tavistock complained that the\r\nprisoners went about the town in female garb, after bell-ringing, and\r\nthat they were associated in these masquerades with women of their own\r\nnation. So they were threatened with the Mill Prison at Plymouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 complaints from Chesterfield about the improper conduct of the\r\nprisoners brought a Transport Office order to the Agent that the\r\nstrictest observation of regulations was necessary, and that the mere\r\nremoval of a prisoner to another parole town was no punishment, and was\r\nto be discontinued. In 1808 there was a serious riot between the\r\nprisoners and the townsfolk in the same place, in which bludgeons were\r\nfreely used and heads freely broken, and from Lichfield came complaints\r\nof the outrageous and insubordinate behaviour of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 Mr. P. Wykeham of Thame Park complained of the prisoners\r\ntrespassing therein; from Bath came protests against the conduct of\r\nGeneral Rouget and his A.D.C.; and in 1809 the behaviour of one\r\nWislawski at Odiham (possibly the ‘Wysilaski’ already mentioned as at\r\nSanquhar) was reported as being so atrocious that he was at once packed\r\noff to a prison-ship.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, at Oswestry, Lieutenant Julien complained that the Agent,\r\nTozer, had insulted him by threatening him with his cane, and accusing\r\nhim of drunkenness in the public-houses. Tozer, on the other hand,\r\ndeclared that Julien and others were rioting in the streets, that he\r\ntried to restore order, and raised his cane in emphasis, whereupon\r\nJulien raised his with offensive intent.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we find complaints sent up by local professionals and\r\ntradesmen that the prisoners on parole unfairly compete with them. Here\r\nit may be remarked that the following of trades and professions by\r\nprisoners of war was by no means confined to the inmates of prisons and\r\nprison-ships, and that there were hundreds of poor officers on parole\r\nwho not only worked at their professions (as Garneray the painter did at\r\nBishop’s Waltham) and at specific trades, but who were glad to eke out\r\ntheir scanty subsistence-money by the manufacture of models, toys,\r\nornaments, &c.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 a baker at Thame complained that the prisoners on parole in that\r\ntown baked bread, to which the Transport Office replied that there was\r\nno objection to their doing it for their own consumption, but not for\r\npublic sale. It is to be hoped the baker was satisfied with this very\r\nacademic reply!\r\n\r\nSo also the bootmakers of Portsmouth complained that the prisoners on\r\nparole in the neighbourhood made boots for sale at lower than the\r\ncurrent rates. The Transport Office replied that orders were strict\r\nagainst this, and that the master bootmakers were to blame for\r\nencouraging this ‘clandestine trade.’\r\n\r\nIn 1813 the doctors at Welshpool complained that the doctors among the\r\nFrench parole prisoners there inoculated private families for small-pox.\r\nThe Transport Office forbade it.\r\n\r\nIn the same year complaints came from Whitchurch in Shropshire of the\r\ndefiant treatment of the limit-rules by the prisoners there; to which\r\nthe Transport Office replied that they had ordered posts to be set up at\r\nthe extremities of the mile-limits, and printed regulations to be posted\r\nin public places; that they were fully sensible of the mischief done by\r\nso many prisoners being on parole, but that they were unable to stop it.\r\n\r\nStill in 1813, the Transport Office commented very severely upon the\r\ncase of a Danish officer at Reading who had been found guilty of forging\r\na ‘certificate of succession’, which I take to be a list of prisoners in\r\ntheir order for being exchanged. I quote this case, as crimes of this\r\ncalibre were hardly known among parole prisoners; for other instances,\r\nsee pages 320 and 439.\r\n\r\nMany complaints were made from the parole towns about the debts left\r\nbehind them by absconded prisoners. The Transport Office invariably\r\nreplied that such debts being private matters, the only remedy was at\r\ncivil law.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to deal with the complaints made by the prisoners—be they\r\nmerely general complaints, or complaints against the people of the\r\ncountry—the number is so great that the task set is to select those of\r\nthe most importance and interest.\r\n\r\nComplaints against fellow prisoners are not common.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 a French doctor, prisoner on parole at Wye in Kent, complains\r\nthat ten of his countrymen, fellow prisoners, wanted him to pay for\r\ndrinks to the extent of twenty-seven shillings. He refused, so they\r\nattacked him, tore his clothes, stole thirty-six shillings, a\r\nhandkerchief, and two medals. He brought his assailants before the\r\nmagistrates, and they were made to refund twenty-five shillings. This so\r\nenraged them that they made his life a burden to him, and he prayed to\r\nbe removed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 a prisoner on parole at Chippenham complained that he was\r\nsubjected to ill treatment by his fellow prisoners. The letter is\r\near-marked:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Trevanion (the local Agent) is directed to publish to all the\r\nprisoners that if any are guilty of misbehaviour to each other, the\r\noffenders will immediately be sent to the Prison, and particularly that\r\nif any one molests or insults the writer of this letter, he shall\r\ninstantly be confined upon its being proved.’\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, however, the writer complains that the bullying is worse than\r\never, and that the other prisoners swear that they will cut him in\r\npieces, so that he dare not leave his lodgings, and has been besieged\r\nthere for days.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Dingart, captain of the _Deux Amis_ privateer, writes\r\nfrom confinement on the _Royal Oak_ prison-ship at Plymouth that he had\r\nbeen treated unjustly. He had, he says, a difference with Feraud,\r\nCaptain of _Le Moras_ privateer, at Tavistock, during which the latter\r\nstruck him, ran away, and kept out of sight for a fortnight. Upon his\r\nreappearance, the complainant returned him the blow with a stick,\r\nwhereupon Feraud brought him up for assault before the Agent,\r\nWillesford, who sent him to a prison-ship.\r\n\r\nAt Penryn in the same year, Chevalier, a naval lieutenant, complained of\r\nbeing insulted and attacked by another prisoner with a stick, who,\r\n‘although only a privateer sailor, is evidently favoured by Loyll’\r\n(Lloyd?) the Agent.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 one Savart was removed from Wincanton to Stapleton Prison at the\r\nrequest of French superior officers who complained of his very violent\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThese complaints were largely due to the tactless Government system of\r\nplacing parole prisoners of widely different ranks together. There are\r\nmany letters during the Seven Years’ War period from officers requesting\r\nto be removed to places where they would be only among people of their\r\nown rank, and not among those ‘qui imaginent que la condition de\r\nprisonnier de guerre peut nous rendre tous égaux.’\r\n\r\nNor was this complaint confined to prisoners on parole, but even more\r\nclosely affected officers who, for breaches of parole, were sent to\r\nprisons or to prison-ships. There are strong complaints in 1758 by\r\n‘broke-paroles’, as they were termed, of the brutal class of prisoners\r\nat Sissinghurst with whom they were condemned to herd; and in one case\r\nthe officer prisoners actually petitioned that a prison official who had\r\nbeen dismissed and punished for cutting and wounding an ordinary\r\nprisoner should be reinstated, as the latter richly deserved the\r\ntreatment he had received.\r\n\r\nLatterly the authorities remedied this by setting apart prison-ships for\r\nofficers, and by providing separate quarters in prisons. Still, in\r\ndealing with the complaints, they had to be constantly on their guard\r\nagainst artifice and fraud, and if the perusal of Government replies to\r\ncomplaints makes us sometimes think that the complainants were harshly\r\nand even brutally dealt with, we may be sure that as a rule the\r\nauthorities had very sufficient grounds for their decisions. For\r\nexample, in 1804, Delormant, an officer on parole at Tiverton, was sent\r\nto a Plymouth hulk for some breach of parole. He complained to Admiral\r\nColpoys that he was obliged there to herd with the common men. Colpoys\r\nwrote to the Transport Board that he had thought right to have a\r\nseparate ship fitted for prisoner officers, and had sent Delormant to\r\nit. Whereupon the Board replied that if Admiral Colpoys had taken the\r\ntrouble to find out what sort of a man Delormant really was, he would\r\nhave left him where he was, but that _for the present_ he might remain\r\non the special ship.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest forms of complaint from prisoners was against the\r\ncustom of punishing a whole community for the sins of a few, or even of\r\na single man. In 1758 a round-robin signed by seventy-five prisoners at\r\nSissinghurst protested that the whole of the inmates of the Castle were\r\nput upon half rations for the faults of a few ‘impertinents’.\r\n\r\nAt Okehampton in the same year, upon a paroled officer being sent to a\r\nlocal prison for some offence, and escaping therefrom, the whole of the\r\nother prisoners in the place were confined to their lodgings for some\r\ndays. When set free they held an indignation meeting, during which one\r\nof the orators waved a stick, as the mayor said, threateningly at him.\r\nWhereupon he was arrested and imprisoned at ‘Coxade’, the ‘Cockside’\r\nprison near Mill Bay, Plymouth.\r\n\r\nWe see an almost pathetic fanning and fluttering of that old French\r\naristocratic plumage, which thirty years later was to be bedraggled in\r\nthe bloody dust, in the complaints of two highborn prisoners of war in\r\n1756 and 1758. In the former year Monsieur de Béthune strongly resented\r\nbeing sent on parole from Bristol into the country:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ayant appris de Mr. Surgunnes (?) que vous lui mandé par votre lettre\r\ndu 13 courant si Messire De Béthune, Chevalier de St. Simon, Marquis\r\nd’Arbest, Baron de Sainte Lucie, Seigneur haut, et bas justicier des\r\nparoisses de Chateauvieux, Corvilac, Lâneau, Pontmartin, Neung et autres\r\nlieux, étoit admis à la parole avec les autres officiers pour lesquels\r\nil s’intéresse, j’aurai l’avantage de vous répondre, qu’un Grand de la\r\ntrempe de Messire De Béthune, qui vous adresse la présente, n’est point\r\nfait pour peupler un endroit aussi désert que la campagne, attendu\r\nqu’allié du costé paternel et maternel à un des plus puissans rois que\r\njamais terre ait porté, Londres, comme Bristol ou autre séjour qu’il\r\nvoudra choisir, est capable de contenir celui qui est tout à vous.\r\n\r\n                                         ‘De Bristol; le 15 Xbre. 1756.’\r\n\r\n\r\nLater he writes that he hears indirectly that this letter has given\r\noffence to the gentlemen at the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office on Tower Hill,\r\nbut maintains that it is excusable from one who is allied to several\r\nkings and sovereign princes, and he expects to have his passport for\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Rohan, on parole at Romsey, not adapting himself easily to\r\nlife in the little Hampshire town, although he had the most rare\r\nprivilege of a six-mile limit around it, wrote on July 4, 1758,\r\nrequesting permission for self and three or four officers to go to\r\nSouthampton once a week to make purchases, as Romsey Market is so\r\nindifferent, and to pass the night there. The six-mile limit, he says,\r\ndoes not enable him to avail himself of the hospitality of the people of\r\nquality, and he wants leave to go further with his suite. He adds a\r\npanegyric on the high birth and the honour of French naval officers,\r\nwhich made parole-breaking an impossibility, and he resents their being\r\nplaced in the same category with privateer and merchant-ship captains.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Commissioners reply that no exceptions can be made in his\r\nfavour, and that as Southampton is a sea-port, leave to visit it cannot\r\nbe thought of.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 twenty-two officers on parole at Cranbrook in Kent prayed to be\r\nsent to Maidstone, on the plea that there were no lodgings to be had in\r\nCranbrook except at exorbitant rates; that the bakers only baked once or\r\ntwice a week, and that sometimes the supply of bread ran short if it was\r\nnot ordered beforehand and an extra price paid for it; that vegetables\r\nwere hardly to be obtained; and that, finally, they were ill-treated by\r\nthe inhabitants. No notice was taken of this petition.\r\n\r\nIn 1757 a prisoner writes from Tenterden:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘S’il faut que je reste en Angleterre, permettez-moi encore de vous\r\nprier de vouloir bien m’envoier dans une meilleure place, n’ayant pas\r\ndéjà lieu de me louer du peuple de ce village. Sur des plaintes que\r\nplusieurs Français ont portées au maire depuis que je suis ici, il a\r\nfait afficher de ne point insulter aux Français, l’affiche a été le même\r\njour arrachée. On a remis une autre. Il est bien désagréable d’être dans\r\nune ville où l’on est obligé de défendre aux peuples d’insulter les\r\nprisonniers. J’ai ouï dire aux Français qui ont été à Maidstone que\r\nc’était très bien et qu’ils n’ont jamais été insultés ... ce qui me fait\r\nvous demander une autre place, c’est qu’on déjà faillit d’être jeté dans\r\nla boue en passant dans les chemins, ayant eu cependant l’intention de\r\ncéder le pavé.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reply, the Commissioners of the ‘Sick and Hurt’ Office ask the Agent\r\nat Tenterden why, when he heard complaints, he did not inform the Board.\r\nThe complainant, however, was not to be moved, as he had previously been\r\nsent to Sissinghurst for punishment.\r\n\r\nIn 1758, twenty officers at Tenterden prayed for removal elsewhere,\r\nsaying that as the neighbourhood was a residential one for extremely\r\nrich people, lodgings at moderate prices were not to be had, and that\r\nthe townspeople cared so little to take in foreign guests of their\r\ndescription, that if they were taken ill the landlords turned them out.\r\nThis application was ear-marked for inquiry.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the poor fellows received but scanty courtesy from the rank and\r\nfile of their captors, and the foreigner then, far more than now, was\r\ndeemed fair game for oppression and robbery. In support of this I will\r\nquote some remarks by Colonel Thierry, whose case certainly appears to\r\nbe a particularly hard one.\r\n\r\nColonel Thierry had been sent to Stapleton Prison in 1812 for having\r\nviolated his parole by writing from Oswestry to his niece, the Comtesse\r\nde la Frotté, without having submitted the letter, according to parole\r\nrule, to the Agent. He asks for humane treatment, a separate room, a\r\nservant, and liberty to go to market.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Les vexations dont on m’a accablé en route sont révoltantes. Les\r\nscélérats que vos lois envoyent à Tyburn ne sont pas plus mal traités;\r\nune semblable conduite envers un Colonel, prisonnier de guerre, est une\r\nhorreur de plus que j’aurai le droit de reprocher aux Anglais pour\r\nlesquels j’ai eu tant de bontés lorsqu’ils sont tombés en mon pouvoir.\r\nSi le Gouvernement français fût instruit des mauvais traitements dont on\r\naccable les Français de touts grades, et donnait des ordres pour user de\r\nreprésailles envers les Anglais détenus en France ... le Gouvernement\r\nanglais ordonnerait-il à ses agents de traiter avec plus d’égards, de\r\nmodération, d’humanité ses prisonniers.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a postscript the Colonel adds that his nephew, the Comte de la\r\nFrotté, is with Wellington, that another is in the Royal Navy, and that\r\nall are English born. One is glad to know that the Colonel’s prayer was\r\nheard, and that he was released from Stapleton.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 a prisoner writes from Tenterden:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Last Thursday, March 16th, towards half-past eight at night, I was\r\ngoing to supper, and passed in front of a butcher’s shop where there is\r\na bench fixed near the door on which three or four youths were sitting,\r\nand at the end one who is a marine drummer leaning against a wall\r\nprojecting two feet on to the street. When I came near them I guessed\r\nthey were talking about us Frenchmen, for I heard one of them say: “Here\r\ncomes one of them,” and when I was a few paces beyond them one of them\r\nhit me on the right cheek with something soft and cold. As I entered my\r\nlodging I turned round and said: “You had better be careful!” Last\r\nSunday at half-past eight, as I was going to supper, being between the\r\nsame butcher’s shop and the churchyard gate, some one threw at me a\r\nstick quite three feet long and heavy enough to wound me severely....’\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso at Tenterden, a prisoner named D’Helincourt, going home one night\r\nwith a Doctor Chomel, met at the door of the latter’s lodging a youth\r\nand two girls, one of whom was the daughter of Chomel’s landlord, ‘avec\r\nlaquelle il avait plusieurs fois poussé la plaisanterie jusqu’à\r\nl’embrasser sans qu’elle l’eût jamais trouvé mauvais, et ayant engagé M.\r\nChomel à l’embrasser aussi.’ But the other girl, whom they would also\r\nkiss, played the prude; the youth with her misunderstood what\r\nD’Helincourt said, and hit him under the chin with his fist, which made\r\nD’Helincourt hit him back with his cane on the arm, and all seemed at an\r\nend. Not long after, D’Helincourt was in the market, when about thirty\r\nyouths came along. One of them went up to him and asked him if he\r\nremembered him, and hit him on the chest. D’Helincourt collared him, to\r\ntake him to the Mayor, but the others set on him, and he certainly would\r\nhave been killed had not some dragoons come up and rescued him.\r\n\r\nApparently the Agents and Magistrates were too much afraid of offending\r\nthe people to grant justice to these poor strangers.\r\n\r\nAt Cranbrook a French officer was assaulted by a local ruffian and hit\r\nhim back, for which he was sent to Sissinghurst.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 and 1809 many complaints from officers were received that their\r\napplications to be allowed to go to places like Bath and Cheltenham for\r\nthe benefit of their health were too often met with the stereotyped\r\nreply that ‘your complaint is evidently not of such a nature as to be\r\ncured by the waters of Bath or Cheltenham’. Of course, the Transport\r\nOffice knew well enough that the complaints were not curable by the\r\n_waters_ of those places, but by their life and gaiety: by the change\r\nfrom the monotonous country town with its narrow, _gauche_ society, its\r\nwretched inns, and its mile limit, to the fashionable world of gaming,\r\nand dancing, and music, and flirting; but they also knew that to permit\r\nFrench officers to gather at these places in numbers would be to\r\nencourage plotting and planning, and to bring together gentlemen whom it\r\nwas desirable to keep apart.\r\n\r\nSo in the latter year the Mayor of Bath received an order from the Earl\r\nof Liverpool that all prisoners of war were to be removed from the city\r\nexcept those who could produce certificates from two respectable doctors\r\nof the necessity of their remaining, ‘which must be done with such\r\ncaution as, if required, the same may be verified on oath.’ The officers\r\naffected by this order were to go to Bishop’s Waltham, Odiham,\r\nWincanton, and Tiverton.\r\n\r\nOf complaints by prisoners on parole against the country people there\r\nmust be many hundreds, the greater number of them dating from the period\r\nof the Seven Years’ War. During this time the prisoners were largely\r\ndistributed in Kent, a county which, from its proximity to France, and\r\nits consequent continuous memory of wrongs, fancied and real, suffered\r\nat the hands of Frenchmen during the many centuries of warfare between\r\nthe two countries, when Kent bore the brunt of invasion and fighting,\r\nmay be understood to have entertained no particular affection for\r\nFrenchmen, despite the ceaseless commerce of a particular kind which the\r\nbitterest of wars could not interrupt.\r\n\r\nA few instances will suffice to exemplify the unhappy relationship which\r\nexisted, not in Kent alone, but everywhere, between the country people\r\nand the unfortunate foreigners thrust among them.\r\n\r\nIn 1757 a prisoner on parole at Basingstoke complained that he was in\r\nbed at 11 p.m., when there came ‘7 ou 8 drôles qui les défièrent de\r\nsortir en les accablant d’injures atroces, et frappant aux portes et aux\r\nfenêtres comme s’ils avoient voulu jeter la maison en bas.’ Another\r\nprisoner here had stones thrown at him ‘d’une telle force qu’elles\r\nfaisoient feu sur le pavé,’ whilst another lot of youths broke windows\r\nand almost uprooted the garden.\r\n\r\nFrom Wye in Kent is a whole batch of letters of complaint against the\r\npeople. One of them is a round-robin signed by eighty prisoners\r\ncomplaining of bad and dear lodgings, and praying to be sent to Ashford,\r\nwhich was four times the size of Wye, and where there were only\r\nforty-five prisoners, and lodgings were better and cheaper.\r\n\r\nAt Tonbridge, in the same year, two parole officers dropped some milk\r\nfor fun on the hat of a milk-woman at the door below their window. Some\r\nchaff ensued which a certain officious and mischief-making man named\r\nMiles heard, who threatened he would report the Frenchmen for _improper\r\nconduct_, and get them sent to Sissinghurst! The authors of the ‘fun’\r\nwrote to the authorities informing them of the circumstances, and asking\r\nfor forgiveness, knowing well that men had been sent to Sissinghurst for\r\nless. Whether the authorities saw the joke or not does not appear.\r\n\r\nThe rabble of the parole towns had recourse to all sorts of devices to\r\nmake the prisoners break their paroles so that they could claim the\r\nusual reward of ten shillings. At Helston, on August 1, 1757, Hingston,\r\nthe Parole Agent, sent to Dyer, the Agent at Penryn, a prisoner named\r\nChannazast, for being out of his lodgings all night. At the examination,\r\nTonken, in whose house the man was, and who was liable to punishment for\r\nharbouring him, said, and wrote later:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I having been sent for by the mayor of our town this day to answer for\r\nI cannot tell what, however I’ll describe it to you in the best manner I\r\nam able. You must know that last Friday evening, I asked Monsieur\r\nChannazast to supper at my house who came according to my request. Now I\r\nhave two Frenchmen boarded at my house, so they sat down together till\r\nmost ten o’clock. At which time I had intelligence brought me that there\r\nwas a soldier and another man waiting in the street for him to come out\r\nin order to get the ten shillings that was orders given by the Mayor for\r\ntaking up all Frenchmen who was seen out of their Quarters after 9\r\no’clock. So, to prevent this rascally imposition I desired the man to go\r\nto bed with his two countrymen which he did accordingly altho’ he was\r\nnot out of my house for the night——’\r\n\r\n\r\nReply: ‘Make enquiries into this.’\r\n\r\nFrom Torrington in the same year eighteen prisoners pray to be sent\r\nelsewhere:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Insultés à chaque instant par mille et millions d’injures ou menaces,\r\nestre souvent poursuivis par la popullace jusqu’à nos portes à coups de\r\nroches et coups de bâtons. En outre encore, Monseigneur, avant hier il\r\nfut tirré un coup de fusil à plomb à cinque heures apres midy n’etant\r\ndistant de notre logement que d’une portée de pistolet, heureusement\r\nceluy qui nous l’envoyoit ne nous avoit point assez bien ajusté . . .\r\nqu’il est dans tous les villages des hommes proposés pour rendre justice\r\ntres surrement bien judiscieux mais il est une cause qui l’empeche de\r\nnous prouver son equité comme la crainte de detourner la populasce\r\nadverse . . . nous avons été obligés de commettre à tous moments à\r\nsuporter sans rien dire ce surcrois de malheurs. . . .’\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo more letters, each signed by the same eighteen prisoners, follow to\r\nthe same intent. The man who fired the shot was brought up, and\r\npunishment promised, but nothing was done. Also it was promised that a\r\nnotice forbidding the insulting of prisoners should be posted up, but\r\nneither was this done. The same letters complain also of robbery by\r\nlodging keepers, for the usual rate of 4_s._ a week was raised to 4_s._\r\n6_d._, and a month later to 5_s._ One prisoner refused to pay this. The\r\nwoman who let the lodging complained to ‘Enjolace,’ the Agent, who tells\r\nthe prisoner he must either pay what is demanded, or go to prison.\r\n\r\nA prisoner at Odiham in the same year complained that a country girl\r\nencouraged him to address her, and that when he did, summoned him for\r\nviolently assaulting her. He was fined twelve guineas, complains that\r\nhis defence was not heard, and that ever since he had been insulted and\r\npersecuted by the country people.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 a letter, signed by fifty-six prisoners at Sevenoaks, bitterly\r\ncomplains that the behaviour of the country people is so bad that they\r\ndare not go out. In the same year a doctor, a prisoner in Sissinghurst\r\nCastle, complains of a grave injustice. He says that when on parole at\r\nSevenoaks he was called in by a fellow countryman, cured him, and was\r\npaid his fee, but that ‘Nache’, the Agent at Sevenoaks, demanded half\r\nthe fee, and upon the prisoner’s refusal to pay him, reported the case\r\nto the Admiralty, and got him committed to Sissinghurst.\r\n\r\nA disgraceful and successful plot to ruin a prisoner is told from\r\nPetersfield in 1758.\r\n\r\nFifteen officers on parole appealed on behalf of one of their number\r\nnamed Morriset. He was in bed on December 22, at 8 a.m., in his lodging\r\nat one ‘Schollers’, a saddler, when Mrs. ‘Schollers’ came into the room\r\non the pretext of looking for a slipper, and sat herself on the end of\r\nthe bed. Suddenly, in came her husband, and, finding his wife there,\r\nattacked Morriset cruelly. Morriset to defend himself seized a knife\r\nfrom a waistcoat hanging on the bed, and ‘Schollers’ dropped his hold of\r\nhim, but took from the waistcoat three guineas and some ‘chelins’, then\r\ncalled in a constable, accused Morriset of behaving improperly with his\r\nwife, and claimed a hundred pounds, or he would summons him. Morriset\r\nwas brought up before the magistrates, and, despite his protestations of\r\ninnocence, was sent to Winchester Jail. In reply to the appeal, the\r\nCommissioners said that they could not interfere in what was a private\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIn the same year a prisoner wrote from Callington:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Lundy passé je fus attaqué dans mon logement par Thomas, garçon de Mr.\r\nAvis qui, après m’avoir dit toutes les sottises imaginables, ne s’en\r\ncontenta pas, sans que je luy répondis à aucune de ses mauvaises\r\nparolles, il sauta sur moy, et me frapa, et je fus obligé de m’en\r\ndéfendre. Dimance dernier venant de me promener à 8 heures du soir, je\r\nrancontray dans la rue près de mon logement une quarantaine d’Anglois\r\narmés de bâtons pour me fraper si je n’avois peu me sauver à la faveur\r\nde mes jambes. Mardy sur les 7 heures de soir je fus attaqué en pleine\r\nplace par les Anglois qui me donnèrent beaucoup de coups et m’étant\r\ndéfait d’eux je me sauvai à l’oberge du _Soleil_ ou j’ai été obligé de\r\ncoucher par ordre de Mr. Ordon, veu qu’il y avoit des Anglois qui\r\nm’attendoient pour me maltraiter.’\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even in 1756, when the persecution of prisoners by the rural\r\nriff-raff was very bad, we find a testimony from the officers on parole\r\nat Sodbury in Gloucestershire to the kindly behaviour of the\r\ninhabitants, saying that only on holidays are they sometimes jeered at,\r\nand asking to be kept there until exchanged.\r\n\r\nYet the next year, eighteen officers at the same place formulate to the\r\nCommissioners of the Sick and Wounded the following complaints:\r\n\r\n1. Three Englishmen attacked two prisoners with sticks.\r\n\r\n2. A naval doctor was struck in the face by a butcher.\r\n\r\n3. A captain and a lieutenant were attacked with stones, bricks, and\r\nsticks, knocked down, and had to fly for safety to the house of Ludlow\r\nthe Agent.\r\n\r\n4. A second-captain, returning home, was attacked and knocked down in\r\nfront of the _Bell_ inn by a crowd, and would have been killed but for\r\nthe intervention of some townspeople.\r\n\r\n5. Two captains were at supper at the _Bell_. On leaving the house they\r\nwere set on by four men who had been waiting for them, but with the help\r\nof some townspeople they made a fight and got away.\r\n\r\n6. Between 10 and 11 p.m. a lieutenant had a terrible attack made on his\r\nlodging by a gang of men who broke in, and left him half dead. After\r\nwhich they went to an inn where some French prisoners lodged, and tried\r\nto break in ‘jusqu’au point, pour ainsy dire, de le demolir,’ swearing\r\nthey would kill every Frenchman they found.\r\n\r\nFrom Crediton a complaint signed by nearly fifty prisoners spoke of\r\nfrequent attacks and insults, not only by low ruffians and loafers, but\r\nby people of social position, who, so far from doing their best to\r\ndissuade the lower classes, rather encouraged them. Even Mr. David, a\r\nman of apparently superior position, put a prisoner, a Captain Gazeau,\r\ninto prison, took the keys himself, and kept them for a day in spite of\r\nthe Portreeve’s remonstrance, but was made to pay damages by the effort\r\nof another man of local prominence.\r\n\r\nThe men selected as agents in the parole towns too often seem to have\r\nbeen socially unfitted for their positions as the ‘guides, philosophers,\r\nand friends’ of officers and gentlemen. At Crediton, for instance, the\r\nappointment of a Mr. Harvey called forth a remonstrance signed by sixty\r\nprisoners, one of whom thus described him:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Mr. Harvey à son arrivée de Londres, glorieux d’être exaucé, n’eut rien\r\nde plus pressé que de faire voir dans toutes les oberges et dans les\r\nrues les ordres dont il était revetu de la part des honorables\r\nCommissaires; ce qui ne pourra que nous faire un très mauvais effet, veu\r\nque le commun peuple qui habite ce pays-ci est beaucoup irrité contre\r\nles Français, à cause de la Nation et sans jusqu’au présent qu’aucun\r\nFrançais n’est donné aucun sujet de plainte.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1756 the _aumonier_ of the Comte de Gramont, after complaining\r\nthat the inhabitants of Ashburton are ‘un peuple sans règle et sans\r\néducation’, by whom he was insulted, hissed, and stoned, and when he\r\nrepresented this to the authorities was ‘garrotté’ and taken to Exeter\r\nPrison, ridicules the status of the agents—here a shoemaker, here a\r\ntailor, here an apothecary, who dare not, for business reasons, take the\r\npart of the prisoners. He says he offered his services to well-to-do\r\npeople in the neighbourhood, but they were declined—deceit on his part\r\nperhaps being feared.\r\n\r\nFrom Ashford, Kent, a complainant writes, in 1758, that he was rather\r\ndrunk one evening and went out for a walk to pick himself up. He met a\r\nmounted servant of Lord Winchilsea with a dog. He touched the dog,\r\nwhereupon the servant dismounted and hit him in the face. A crowd then\r\nassembled, armed with sticks, and one man with a gun, and ill-treated\r\nhim until he was unconscious, tied his hands behind him, emptied his\r\npockets, and took him before Mr. Tritton. Knowing English fairly well,\r\nthe prisoner justified himself, but he was committed to the _cachot_. He\r\nwas then accused of having ill-treated a woman who, out of pity, had\r\nsent for her husband to help him. He handed in a certificate of injuries\r\nreceived, signed by Dr. Charles Fagg. His name was Marc Layne.\r\n\r\nComplaints from Goudhurst in Kent relate that on one occasion three men\r\nleft their hop-dressing to attack passing prisoners. Upon another, the\r\nFrench officers were, _mirabile dictu_, playing ‘criquet’, and told a\r\nboy of ten to get out of the way and not interfere with them, whereupon\r\nthe boy called his companions, and there ensued a disturbance. A\r\nmagistrate came up, and the result was that a Captain Lamoise had to pay\r\n£1 1_s._ or go to Maidstone Jail.\r\n\r\nThat the decent members of the community reprobated these attacks on\r\ndefenceless foreigners, although they rarely seem to have taken any\r\nsteps to stop them, is evident from the following story. At Goudhurst,\r\nsome French prisoners, coming out of an inn, were attacked by a mob.\r\nThirty-seven paroled officers there signed a petition and accompanied it\r\nwith this testimony from inhabitants, dated November 9, 1757:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We, the inhabitants of the Parish of Goudhurst, certifie that we never\r\nwas insulted in any respect by the French gentlemen, nor to their\r\nknowledge have they caused any Riot except when they have been drawn in\r\nby a Parcel of drunken, ignorant, and scandalous men who make it their\r\nBusiness to ensnare them for the sake of a little money.\r\n\r\n                                                               (Signed.)\r\n\r\n           STEPHEN OSBOURNE. THOS. BALLARD. JOHN SAVAGE.\r\n               JASPER SPRANG. RICHARD ROYSE. J. DICKINSON.\r\n               W. HUNT. JOHN BUNNELL. ZACH. SIMS.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complainants made declaration:\r\n\r\n1. That the bad man Rastly exclaimed he would knock down the first\r\nFrenchman he met.\r\n\r\n2. Two French prisoners were sounding horns and hautboys in the fields.\r\nThe servant of the owner ordered them to go. They went quietly, but the\r\nman followed them and struck them. They complained to Tarith, the Agent,\r\nbut he said that it did not concern him.\r\n\r\n3. This servant assembled fifteen men with sticks, and stopped all exit\r\nfrom Bunnell’s inn, where five French prisoners were drinking. The\r\nprisoners were warned not to leave, and, although ‘remplis de boisson’,\r\nthey kept in. Nine o’clock, ten o’clock came; they resolved to go out,\r\none of them being drunk; they were attacked and brutally ill-used.\r\n\r\nThe Agent assured them that they should have justice, but they did not\r\nget it.\r\n\r\nAs physical resistance to attacks and insults would have made matters\r\nworse for the Frenchmen, besides being hopeless in the face of great\r\nodds of numbers, it was resolved in one place at any rate, the name of\r\nwhich I cannot find, to resort to boycotting as a means of reprisal. I\r\ngive the circulated notice of this in its original quaint and illiterate\r\nFrench:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘En conséquence de la délibération faite et teneu par le corps de\r\nFrançois deteneus en cette ville il a esté ordonné qu’après qu’il aura\r\ncette Notoire, que quelque Marchand, Fabriquant, Boutiquier etcetera de\r\ncette ville aurons insulté, injurié, ou comis quelque _aiesais_ (?) au\r\nvis à vis de quelque François tel que puis être, et que le fait aura été\r\naverée, il sera mis une affiche dans les Lieus les plus aparants portant\r\nproscription de sa Maison, Boutique, Fabrique etcetera, et ordonné et\r\ndefendeu à tout François quelque qualité, condition qu’il soy sous Paine\r\nd’être regardé et déclaré traité à la Patrie et de subire plus grande\r\nPunition suivent l’exsigence du cas et qu’il en sera decidé.\r\n\r\n                                                            ‘LA FRANCE.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above is dated 1758.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 the parole prisoners at Alresford complained of being constantly\r\nmolested and insulted by the inhabitants, and asked to be sent\r\nelsewhere. Later, however, the local gentry and principal people\r\nguarantee a cessation of this, and the prisoners pray to be allowed to\r\nstay. The officer prisoners asked to be allowed to accept invitations at\r\nWinchester, but were refused. In the same year prisoners at Redruth\r\ncomplained of daily insults at the hands of an uncivilized populace, and\r\nfrom Chippenham twenty-nine officers signed a complaint about insults\r\nand attacks, and stated that as a result one of them was obliged to keep\r\nhis room for eight days.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, prisoners under orders to leave Tavistock for another\r\nparole town petition to be allowed to remain there, as the Agent has\r\nbeen so good to them; and as a sign that even in Kent matters were\r\nchanging for the better, the prayer of some parole prisoners at\r\nTenterden to be sent to Cranbrook on account of the insults by the\r\npeople, is counterbalanced by a petition of other prisoners in the same\r\ntown who assert that only a few soldiers have insulted them, and asking\r\nthat no change be made, as the inhabitants are hospitable and kindly,\r\nand the Agent very just and lenient.\r\n\r\nMuch quiet, unostentatious kindness was shown towards the prisoners\r\nwhich has not been recorded, but in the Memoir of William Pearce of\r\nLaunceston, in 1810, it is written that he made the parole prisoners in\r\nthat town the objects of his special attention; that he gave them\r\nreligious instruction, circulated tracts among them in their own\r\nlanguage, and relieved their necessities, with the result that many\r\nreformed and attended his services. One prisoner came back after the\r\nPeace of 1815, lived in the service of the chapel, and was buried in its\r\ngrave-yard. _En parenthèse_ the writer adds that the boys of Launceston\r\ngot quite into the habit of ejaculating ‘Morbleu!’ from hearing it so\r\nconstantly on the lips of the French prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the _Life of Hannah More_, written by William Roberts, we read:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Some French officers of cultivated minds and polished manners being on\r\ntheir parole in the neighbourhood of Bristol, were frequent guests at\r\nMr. More’s house, and always fixed upon Hannah as their interpreter, and\r\nher intercourse with their society is said to have laid the ground of\r\nthat free and elegant use of their language for which she was afterwards\r\ndistinguished.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n                       PAROLE LIFE. SUNDRY NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this and the succeeding chapter I gather together a number of notes\r\nconnected with the life of the paroled prisoners in Britain, which could\r\nnot conveniently be classed under the headings of previous chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BEDALE, YORKSHIRE\r\n\r\nDuring the Seven Years’ War prisoners were on parole at Bedale in\r\nYorkshire. The following lines referring to them, sent to me by my\r\nfriend, Mrs. Cockburn-Hood, were written by Robert Hird, a Bedale\r\nshoemaker, who was born in 1768:\r\n\r\n ‘And this one isle by Frenchmen then in prisoners did abound,\r\n ’Twas forty thousand Gallic men. Bedale its quota found:\r\n And here they were at liberty, and that for a long time,\r\n Till Seventeen Hundred and Sixty Three, they then a Peace did sign,\r\n But though at large, they had their bound, it was a good walk out,\r\n Matthew Masterman in their round, they put him to the rout;\r\n This was near to the Standing Stone: at Fleetham Feast he’d been,\r\n And here poor Matthew they fell on. He soon defeated them;\r\n His arms were long, and he struck hard, they could not bear his blows,\r\n The French threw stones, like some petard; he ran, and thus did lose.\r\n James Wilkinson, he lived here then, he’d sons and daughters fair,\r\n Barber he was in great esteem, the Frenchmen oft drew there.’\r\n\r\nTo this the sender appended a note:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In the houses round Bedale there are hand-screens decorated with\r\nlandscapes in straw, and I have a curious doll’s chair in wood with\r\nknobs containing cherry stones which rattle. These were made by French\r\nprisoners, according to tradition.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 DERBY\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. P. H. Currey, F.R.I.B.A., of Derby, for the\r\nfollowing extract, dated June 20, 1763, from All Saints’ Parish Book,\r\nquoted in Simpson’s _History of Derby_:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘These men (the prisoners during the Seven Years’ War), were dispersed\r\ninto many parts of the nation, 300 being sent to this town on parole\r\nabout July 1759, where they continued until the end of the War in 1763.\r\nTheir behaviour at first was impudent and insolent, at all times vain\r\nand effeminate, and their whole deportment light and unmanly, and we may\r\nventure to say from our observation and knowledge of them, that in any\r\nfuture war this nation has nothing to fear from them as an enemy. During\r\ntheir abode here, the road from this place to Nottingham was by act of\r\nParliament repaired, the part from St. Mary’s Bridge (which by reason of\r\nthe floods was impassable) being greatly raised. Numbers of these people\r\nwere daily employed, who worked in their _bag-wigs_, _pig-tails_,\r\n_ruffles_, etc., etc., a matter which afforded us much merriment. But,\r\nto their honour let it be remembered, that scarce _one_ act of fraud or\r\ntheft was committed by any of them during their stay among us. These men\r\nwere allowed 6_d._ a day each by the British Government.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWe read that an Italian prisoner on parole at Derby in 1797 went to\r\nLeicester and bought a pair of pistols, thus committing a double breach\r\nof his parole by going beyond the limit, and by possessing himself of\r\narms. ‘It is presumed,’ remarks the chronicler, ‘from the remarkable\r\nanxiety he showed to procure possession of these offensive weapons, that\r\nhe has some particular object to accomplish by them—perhaps his\r\nliberation.’\r\n\r\nIt is much more likely that his object was to fight a duel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ASHBOURNE, DERBYSHIRE\r\n\r\nMr. Richard Holland, of Barton under Needwood, Staffordshire, has\r\nfavoured me with this note about Ashbourne.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Here in 1803 were Rochambeau and 300 of his officers. The house where\r\nthe general resided is well known, and a large building was erected in\r\nwhich to lodge the prisoners who could not afford to find their own\r\nhouses or apartments. I have heard that the limit of parole was two\r\nmiles.... I never heard of any breaches of parole or crimes committed by\r\nthe prisoners....\r\n\r\nI have often heard that the prisoners made for sale many curious\r\narticles, models, etc., ... but I remember a fine drawing of a\r\nman-of-war on the outside wall of the prison referred to, which now\r\nhappens to belong to me.... Even fifty years ago very little was\r\nremembered of the prisoners. One of them was a famous runner, and I knew\r\nan old man who told me he ran a race with the Frenchman, and beat him\r\ntoo!’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1804 General Pageot was on parole at Ashbourne. Here he seems to have\r\nbeen received, like so many of his countrymen prisoners, on a footing of\r\nfriendship at the houses of the neighbouring gentry, for he received\r\npermission to live for eight days at Wooton Lodge, the seat of Colonel\r\nWilson. In granting this unusual indulgence the Commissioners remark\r\nthat ‘as our people are very strictly treated in France, it is improper\r\nthat unusual indulgences be given to French prisoners, and we hope that\r\nno other applications will be made’.\r\n\r\nLater on the Commissioners wrote to Colonel Wilson:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘As it appears by letters between General Pageot and some of his\r\ncountrymen that he is paying his addresses to a Lady of Respectability\r\nin or near Ashbourne, the Board think it proper that you should be\r\ninformed that they have good authority for believing that he is actually\r\na married man, and has a family in France.’\r\n\r\n\r\nStill later, writing to Mr. Bainbrigge, the Commissioners say that\r\nGeneral Pageot has been sent to Montgomery, and they recommend Mr.\r\nBainbrigge to take measures to prevent him having any communication with\r\nthe lady, Mr. Bainbrigge’s niece.\r\n\r\nSay they:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘From Motives of Public Duty the Commissioners, when they first heard of\r\nthe intended connexion between General Pageot and Miss Bainbrigge, they\r\ncaused such suspicious circumstances respecting the General as came to\r\ntheir knowledge to be communicated to the young lady’s mother, and that\r\nit affords them very much satisfaction now to find that her Friends are\r\ndisposed to prevent an union which could promise very little comfort to\r\nher or Honour to her Family.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHESTERFIELD\r\n\r\nMy best thanks are due to Mr. W. Hawkesly Edmunds, Scarsdale House,\r\nChesterfield, for these notes:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Mrs. Roberts, widow of Lieutenant Roberts, R.N., left some interesting\r\nreminiscences among her papers. She says:\r\n\r\n‘Different indeed was the aspect of the town from what one sees to-day.\r\nGrim visages and whiskered faces met one at every turn, to say nothing\r\nof moustaches, faded uniforms, and rusty cocked hats. At certain hours\r\nof the day it was difficult to walk along the High Street or the middle\r\nCauseway, for these were the favourite promenades of the officers on\r\nparole. When the weather permitted, they assembled each morning and\r\nevening to the number of 200 to exchange friendly greetings with all the\r\nextravagance of gesture and high-pitched voice for which the Frenchman\r\nis remarkable.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French prisoners in Chesterfield in the years around 1806 were for\r\nthe most part, if not wholly, officers and their servants, and their\r\ntreatment by the English Government was liberal and mild. All officers\r\ndown to the rank of Captain, inclusive, were allowed ten shillings per\r\nweek, and all below that rank, seven shillings each. On giving their\r\nparole they were allowed the greatest freedom; had permission to walk\r\none mile from the town in any direction, but had to be in their lodgings\r\nat 8 each evening. At that hour a bell rang, known as the Frenchman’s\r\nBell. It was, in fact, the very bell in the tower of the church formerly\r\nused as the curfew bell. It was in connexion with this mile regulation\r\nthat a little fraud was perpetrated by Sir Windsor Hunloke, Bart., which\r\nwas winked at by the authorities. Wingerworth Hall, the residence of Sir\r\nWindsor, was just outside the mile limit, but with the desire that many\r\nof the prisoners, who, like himself, were Roman Catholics, should visit\r\nhim, he caused the milestone to be removed along the road to the other\r\nside of the hall, and so brought his residence within the mile limit.\r\nThis old milestone is still to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were first in charge of a Commissary, a local solicitor,\r\nMr. John Bower, of Spital Lodge, but later the Government appointed\r\nsuperannuated lieutenants in the Navy. The first of these, Lieutenant\r\nGawen, found that there had been so many escapes during Mr. Bower’s\r\nkindly but lax régime that he instituted more stringent regulations, and\r\nmustered the men twice a week instead of once, and he inspected all\r\ncorrespondence both to and from the prisoners. The first detachment of\r\nprisoners arrived in 1803, officers both of the Army and Navy; most of\r\nthem had undergone the greatest privations. These were the prisoners\r\nfrom San Domingo, whose sufferings during the sieges of the blacks, and\r\nfrom sickness, famine, and sword, are matters of history. Indeed, had\r\nnot the British squadron arrived, it is certain all their lives would\r\nhave been sacrificed by the infuriated blacks in revenge for the\r\nbarbarities practised on them by the French Commander-in-Chief General\r\nRochambeau, who, with Generals D’Henin, Boyer, and Lapoype, Commodore\r\nBarré, and the other naval officers, with the staffs of the generals,\r\nwere all at Chesterfield.\r\n\r\nThe successes of Wellington in Spain brought many more prisoners to\r\nChesterfield, and a great number captured at San Sebastian and\r\nPampeluna.\r\n\r\nMost of the prisoners in the town managed to add to the Government\r\nallowance by teaching languages, drawing, and music. Others produced\r\nvarious articles for sale. Many of them were excellent ornamental\r\nworkers in hair and bone, and there were not a few who were adept\r\nwood-carvers. Making bone models of men-of-war was a favourite\r\noccupation, and the more elaborate of these models were disposed of by\r\nmeans of lotteries. Another of their industries was the working of\r\nstraw, which they dyed in gay colours, or plaited. Silk-hat making and\r\nsilk-weaving they are said to have introduced into the town. They were\r\nalso experts at making woollen gloves, &c., with a bone crook. One\r\nBourlemont opened a dépôt for British wines. One prisoner got employment\r\nas a painter, but another had to seek work as a banksman at the Hady\r\ncoal-pits.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the prisoners were surgeons, and practised in the town, and\r\nit is reported that so great were the services some of these gentlemen\r\nrendered the poor of the town gratuitously, that representations were\r\nmade to the Government, and they were given free pardons and\r\nsafe-conducts back to France.\r\n\r\nSome prisoners married, one the daughter of Turner the Parish Clerk, but\r\ngenerally beneath them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BONE MODEL OF H.M.S. _PRINCE OF WALES_\r\n\r\n  Made by prisoners of war\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Legoux tried to have religious services in a private house, but\r\nthey were poorly attended, the Republicans nearly all being atheists,\r\nand preferring to pass their Sundays at card-tables and billiards.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roberts thus describes some peculiarities of the prisoners’ dress\r\nand manners:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Their large hooped gold ear-rings, their pink or sky-blue umbrellas,\r\nthe Legion of Honour ribbons in their button holes; their profuse\r\nexchange of embraces and even kisses in the public street; their\r\nattendant poodles carrying walking-sticks in their mouths, and their\r\nincessant and vociferous talking. A great source of amusement was the\r\ntraining of birds and dogs.\r\n\r\n‘There were few instances of friction between the prisoners and the\r\ntownsfolk, but there was one angry affray which led to six of the\r\nprisoners being sent to Norman Cross to be kept in close confinement.\r\nThe wives of some of the prisoners had permission to join their husbands\r\nin confinement, but “they were very dingy, plain-looking women.”\r\n\r\n‘Colonel Fruile married a Miss Moore, daughter of a Chesterfield cabinet\r\nmaker, and she, like the English wives of other of the prisoners, went\r\nto France when Peace was proclaimed. Rank distinctions between officers\r\nwere rigidly observed, and the junior officers always saluted their\r\nsuperiors who held levées on certain days of the week. The fortunes of\r\nNapoleon were closely followed; defeats and victories being marked.\r\nDuring the sojourn of the French prisoners at Chesterfield, took place\r\nthe battles of Wagram, Jena, Vienna, Berlin, and the Russian campaign.\r\nThe news of Trafalgar produced great dismay, and the sight of\r\nrejoicings—of sheep and oxen roasted whole, of gangs of men yoked\r\ntogether bringing wood and coals for bonfires, was too much to bear, and\r\nmost of them shut themselves up in their lodgings until the rejoicings\r\nwere over.\r\n\r\n‘After the Peace a few of the prisoners remained in Chesterfield, and\r\nsome of their descendants live in the town to-day. Many died, and were\r\nburied in the “Frenchmen’s Quarter” of the now closed Parish\r\nchurchyard.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                OSWESTRY\r\n\r\nOswestry, in Shropshire, was an important parole town. In 1803, when\r\nrumours were afloat that a concerted simultaneous rising of the French\r\nprisoners of war in the Western Counties was to be carried out, a\r\nhurried transfer of these latter was made to the more inland towns of\r\nStaffordshire and Shropshire. and it has been stated that Oswestry\r\nreceived no less than 700, but this has been authentically contradicted,\r\nchiefly by correspondents to _Bygones_, a most complete receptacle of\r\nold-time information concerning Shropshire and the Welsh border, access\r\nto which I owe to the kindness of Mr. J. E. Anden of Tong, Shifnal.\r\n\r\nAmong the distinguished prisoners at Oswestry were the Marquis\r\nd’Hautpol, on whose _Memories of Captivity in England_ I have already\r\ndrawn largely; General Phillipon, the able defender of Badajos, who\r\nescaped with Lieut. Garnier from Oswestry; and Prince Arenburg, who was\r\nremoved thither to Bridgnorth upon suspicion of having aided a fellow\r\nprisoner to escape.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were, as usual, distributed in lodgings about the town;\r\nsome were at the _Three Tuns_ inn, where bullet marks in a wall are said\r\nto commemorate a duel fought between two of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the _London Chronicle_ of May 20, 1813, I take the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘There is in this town (Oswestry) a French officer on parole who is\r\nsupposed by himself and countrymen to possess strength little inferior\r\nto Samson. He is Monsieur Fiarsse, he follows the profession of a\r\nfencing-master, and is allowed to have considerable skill in that way.\r\nHe had been boasting that he had beat every Englishman that opposed him\r\nin the town where he was last on parole (in Devonshire), and he sent a\r\nchallenge the other day to a private of the 64th Regiment to a\r\nboxing-match. It was accepted. The Frenchman is a very tall, stout-built\r\nman, of a most ferocious countenance; the soldier is a little,\r\nround-faced man, as plump as a partridge. Five rounds were fought; the\r\nfirst, I understand, the Frenchman threw a blow at his adversary with\r\nall his strength which brought him down; he rose, however, in a moment,\r\nand played his part so well that I think M. Fiarsse will never like to\r\nattack a British soldier again! The little fellow made him spin again,\r\nhe dealt his blows with such judgement. After the fifth round, Fiarsse\r\nsaid: “It is ‘nough! I vill no moe!”’\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were French Royalist refugees at Oswestry as elsewhere, and one of\r\nthe hardest tasks of local parole agents was to prevent disturbances\r\nbetween these men and their bitter opponents the Bonapartist officer\r\nprisoners, dwelling in the same towns. In fact, the presence of large\r\nnumbers of French Royalists in England, many of them very highly\r\nconnected, brought about the very frequent attacks made on them in\r\ncontemporary French literature and journalism for playing the parts of\r\nspies and traitors, and originated the parrot-cry at every French\r\ndiplomatic or military and naval reverse, ‘Sold by the princes in\r\nEngland!’\r\n\r\nThere are graves of French prisoners in Oswestry churchyard. Upon one is\r\n‘Ci-gît D. J. J. J. Du Vive, Capitaine-Adjudant aux États-Majors\r\ngénéraux: prisonnier de guerre sur parole; né à Pau, Dép^t des\r\nBasses-Pyrénées, 26 Juillet 1762; décédé à Oswestry, 20 Juillet 1813.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LEEK\r\n\r\nLeek, in Staffordshire, was also an important parole centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The officer prisoners at Leek received all courtesy and hospitality at\r\nthe hands of the principal inhabitants, with many of whom they were on\r\nthe most intimate terms, frequenting the assemblies, which were then as\r\ngay and as well attended as any within a circuit of 20 miles. They used\r\nto dine out in full uniform, each with his body-servant behind his\r\nchair.’ (Sleigh’s _History of Leek_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first prisoners came here in 1803 from San Domingo. In 1809 and 1812\r\nmany more arrived—some accounts say as many as 200, and one fact\r\nconsidered worthy of record is that they were to be met prowling about\r\nearly in the morning in search of snails!\r\n\r\nA correspondent to _Notes and Queries_ writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘All accounts agree that these unfortunates conducted themselves with\r\nthe utmost propriety and self-respect during their enforced sojourn\r\namong us; endearing themselves to the inhabitants generally by their\r\nunwonted courtesy and strictly honourable behaviour. But as to their\r\nestimate of human life, it was unanimously remarked that they seemed to\r\nvalue it no more than we should crushing a fly in a moment of\r\nirritation.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Freemasons had a Lodge ‘Réunion Désirée,’ and a Chapter ‘De\r\nl’Amitié,’ working at Leek in 1810–11.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ALRESFORD\r\n\r\nAt Alresford the prisoners were at first unpopular, but their exertions\r\nat a fire in the town wrought a change of feeling in their favour. It is\r\ninteresting to note that when the Commune in Paris in 1871 drove many\r\nrespectable people abroad, quite a number came to Alresford (as also to\r\nOdiham), from which we may deduce that they were descendants of men who\r\nhad handed down pleasant memories of parole life in these little\r\nHampshire towns.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Headley, Vicar of Alresford, kindly allowed me to copy the\r\nfollowing from his Parish Records:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘1779. The Captain and officers of the Spanish man-of-war who behaved so\r\ngallantly in the engagement with the _Pearl_, and who are prisoners of\r\nwar at Alresford, lately gave an elegant entertainment and ball in\r\nhonour of Capt. Montagu and his officers, in testimony of the high sense\r\nthey entertain of the polite and most generous treatment they received\r\nafter their capture. Capt. Montagu and his officers were present, also\r\nCapt. Oates and officers of the 89th Regiment, and many of the most\r\nrespectable families from the neighbourhood of Alresford.’\r\n\r\n\r\nI am indebted also to Mr. Headley for the following entries in the\r\nregisters of his church:\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Burials._\r\n\r\n 1794.

Aged 51.\r\n\r\nMr. Payne of Alresford told me that the clock on the church tower, which\r\nbears the date 1811, is said to have been presented by the French\r\nprisoners on parole in the town in gratitude for the kindly treatment\r\nthey received from the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 THAME\r\n\r\nAt Thame, in 1809, Israel Eel was charged at the Oxford Quarter Sessions\r\nwith assaulting Ravenau, a French prisoner on parole. To the great\r\nsurprise of all, _not a true bill_ was returned.\r\n\r\nSome of the prisoners at Thame were lodged in a building now called the\r\n‘Bird Cage’, once an inn. A memory of the prisoners lingers in the name\r\nof ‘Frenchman’s Oak’ still given to a large tree there, it having marked\r\ntheir mile boundary.\r\n\r\nGeneral Villaret-Joyeuse, Governor of Martinique, was one of the many\r\nprisoners of fame or rank at Thame. He brought upon himself a rebuke\r\nfrom the Transport Office in 1809, for having said in a letter to his\r\nbrother, ‘Plusieurs Français se sont détruits ne pouvant supporter plus\r\nlongtemps l’humiliation et l’abjection où ils étaient réduits.’ The\r\nTransport Office told him that he had been grossly misinformed, and that\r\nduring the past war only two prisoners were known to have destroyed\r\nthemselves: one was supposed to have done so in consequence of the\r\nderanged state of his account with the French Government, and the other,\r\nhaving robbed his brother prisoner of a large amount, when detected,\r\ndreading the consequence. ‘When you shall have better informed yourself\r\nand altered the said letter accordingly, it will be forwarded to\r\nFrance.’\r\n\r\nGeneral Privé, one of Dupont’s officers, captured at Baylen, was called\r\nto order for making false statements in a letter to the French minister\r\nof war, in an offensive manner: ‘The Board have no objection of your\r\nmaking representations you may think proper to your Government\r\nrespecting the Capitulation of Baylen, and transmitting as many Truths\r\nas you please to France, but indecent Abuse and reproachful Terms are\r\nnot to be suffered.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                               WINCANTON\r\n\r\nTo Mr. George Sweetman I am indebted for some interesting particulars\r\nabout parole prisoner life at Wincanton in Somersetshire. The first\r\nprisoners came here in 1804, captured on the _Didon_, and gradually the\r\nnumber here rose to 350, made up of Frenchmen, Italians, Portuguese, and\r\nSpaniards. In 1811 the census showed that nineteen houses were occupied\r\nby prisoners, who then numbered 297 and 9 women and children. An ‘oldest\r\ninhabitant’, Mr. Olding, who died in 1870, aged eighty-five, told Mr.\r\nSweetman that at one time there were no less than 500 prisoners in\r\nWincanton and the adjacent Bayford. Some of them were men of good\r\nfamily, and were entertained at all the best houses in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n‘After the conquest of Isle of France,’ said Mr. Olding, ‘about fifty\r\nFrench officers were sent here, who were reputed to have brought with\r\nthem half a million sterling.... They lived in their own hired houses or\r\ncomfortable lodgings. The poorer prisoners took their two meals a day at\r\nthe _Restaurant pour les Aspirants_. The main staple of their diet was\r\nonions, leeks, lettuce, cucumbers, and dandelions. The richer, however,\r\nate butchers’ meat plentifully.’\r\n\r\nAltogether the establishment of Wincanton as a parole town must have\r\nbeen of enormous benefit to a linen-weaving centre which was feeling\r\nseverely the competition of the great Lancashire towns, and was fast\r\nlosing its staple industry.\r\n\r\nMr. Sweetman introduces an anecdote which illustrates the great trading\r\ndifficulties which at first existed between foreigners who knew nothing\r\nof English, and natives who were equally ignorant of French.\r\n\r\nOne of the many butchers who attended the market had bought on one\r\noccasion some excellent fat beef to which he called the attention of a\r\nmodel French patrician, and, confusing the Frenchman’s ability to\r\nunderstand the English language with defective hearing, he shouted in\r\nhis loudest tones, which had an effect contrary to what he expected or\r\ndesired. The officer (noted for his long pig-tail, old round hat, and\r\nlong-waisted brown coat), to all the jolly butcher’s earnest appeals to\r\nhim to buy, answered nothing but ‘Non bon, non bon!’\r\n\r\n‘Well, Roger,’ said a brother butcher, ‘If I were you, he should have\r\nbone enough next time!’\r\n\r\n‘So he shall,’ said Roger, and on the next market-day he brought a fine\r\nneck and chine of bull beef, from which lots of steaks were cut, and\r\nsoon sold.\r\n\r\nPresently the old officer came by, and Roger solicited his custom for\r\nhis line show of bones. The indignant Frenchman again exclaimed, ‘Non\r\nbon! non bon!’\r\n\r\n‘Confound the fellow,’ said Roger, ‘what can he want, why, ’tis a’al\r\nbooin, idden it?’\r\n\r\nBoth men were becoming really angry, when a boy standing by, who had\r\nspeedily acquired some knowledge of French, explained the matter to both\r\nmen. When at length they understood each other they both laughed\r\nheartily at the misunderstanding, but the incident became a standing\r\njoke against Roger as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nThe mile boundaries of the prisoners were Bayford Elm on the London\r\nroad; Anchor Bridge on the Ilchester road; Abergavenny Gate on the\r\nCastle Cary road; and Gorselands on the Bruton road. The prisoners\r\nfrequently promenaded the streets in great numbers, four abreast. The\r\nlarge rooms in the public-houses were often rented for holding meetings\r\nof various kinds. On one occasion the large room at the _Swan_ Inn was\r\nused for the lying in state of a Freemason, who was buried in a very\r\nimposing manner. Two other great officers lay in state at the\r\n_Greyhound_ and _The Dogs_. Many died from various causes incidental to\r\ncaptivity. They were buried in the churchyard, and a stone there marks\r\nthe resting-place of a Russian or a Pole who was said to have died of\r\ngrief.[17] One of them committed suicide. Another poor fellow became\r\ndemented, and every day might have been heard playing on a flute a\r\nmournful dirge, which tune he never changed. Others bore their\r\nestrangement from home and country less sorrowfully, and employed their\r\ntime in athletic sports or in carving various articles of different\r\nkinds of wood and bone. Some were allowed to visit friends at a\r\ndistance, always returning faithfully to their parole.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months they gave, twice a week, musical and theatrical\r\nentertainments. Many of the captives, especially those of the upper\r\nranks, were good musicians. These held concerts, which were attended by\r\nthe people of the town.\r\n\r\nSunday was to them the dullest day of the week; they did not know what\r\nto make of it. Some of them went to the parish church and assisted in\r\nthe instrumental part of the service. A few attended the Congregational,\r\nor as it was then called, the Independent Chapel. The majority of them\r\nwere, in name at least, Roman Catholics; whatever they were, they spent\r\nSundays in playing chess, draughts, cards and dominoes,—indeed, almost\r\nanything to while the time away.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners used to meet in large rooms which they hired for various\r\namusements. Some of them were artists, and Mr. Sweetman speaks of many\r\nrooms which they decorated with wall-pictures. In one—the ‘Orange Room’\r\nat _The Dogs_ in South Street—may still be seen wall-paintings done by\r\nthem; also in the house of Mr. James, in the High Street, three panels\r\nof a bedroom are painted with three of the Muses. Miss Impey, of Street,\r\nhas some drawings done by a prisoner, Charles Aubert, who probably did\r\nthe paintings above alluded to.\r\n\r\nAs time went on and the prisoners became more homesick and more\r\nimpatient of restraint, desertions became frequent, and it was necessary\r\nto station a company of infantry in Wincanton, and they were ‘kept\r\nlively’. One night a party was escaping and the constable of the town,\r\nattempting to prevent them, was roughly handled. The soldiers were on\r\nguard all night in the streets, but nevertheless some prisoners managed\r\neven then to escape.\r\n\r\n‘In 1811’, said the _Salisbury Journal_, ‘Culliford, a notorious\r\nsmuggler, was committed to Ilchester Gaol for conveying from Wincanton\r\nseveral of the prisoners there to the Dorsetshire coast, whence they\r\ncrossed to Cherbourg. Culliford was caught with great difficulty, and\r\nthen only because of the large reward offered.’\r\n\r\nThere was at Wincanton, as in other parole towns, a Masonic Lodge among\r\nthe prisoners; it was called (as was also the Lodge at Sanquhar) ‘La\r\nPaix Désirée’. There were English members of it. Mr. Sweetman\r\nreproduces, in the little book upon which I have drawn for my\r\ninformation, the certificate of Louis Michel Duchemin, Master Mason in\r\n1810. This M. Duchemin married Miss Clewett of Wincanton, and settled in\r\nEngland, dying in Birmingham in 1854 or 1855. His widow only survived\r\nhim a week, but he left a son who in 1897 lived in Birmingham, following\r\nhis father’s profession as a teacher of French. M. Duchemin was\r\nevidently much esteemed in Wincanton, as the following testimonial\r\nshows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  ‘Wincanton, June 1821.\r\n\r\n‘I, the undersigned, having been His Majesty’s Agent for Prisoners of\r\nWar on Parole in this place during the late war, do certify that Monsr.\r\nL. M. Duchemin was resident for upwards of six years on his Parole of\r\nHonour in this Town, from the time [1805] of the capture of the French\r\nfrigate _La Torche_ to the removal of the Prisoners to Scotland, and\r\nthat in consequence of his universal good conduct, he was excepted (on a\r\nmemorial presented by Inhabitants to the Commissioners of H. M.\r\nTransport Service) from a previous Order of Removal from this place with\r\nother prisoners of his rank. Monsr. Duchemin married while resident in\r\nthis place into a respectable family, and, having known him from 1806 to\r\nthe present time, I can with much truth concur in the Testimonial of his\r\nWells friends.\r\n\r\n                                                          ‘G. MESSITER.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Mr. George Messiter, a solicitor, was one of the best sort of\r\nparole agents, and is thus eulogized by Mr. Sweetman:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘He was a gentleman well qualified for the office he held: of a noble\r\nmien, brave, and held in respect by all who knew him. Under his\r\ndirection the captives were supplied with every accommodation he could\r\ngive them. Several years after his death one of the survivors, an army\r\nsurgeon, came to the scene of his former captivity, when he paid a high\r\ntribute to the Commissary, and spoke in terms of affection of the\r\ntownspeople amongst whom he had sojourned.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that Messiter had to deal with such troublesome\r\nfellows as Generals Rochambeau and Boyer (who were actually sent away\r\nfrom Wincanton, as they had already been sent away from other parole\r\nplaces, on account of their misdeeds), the worth of this testimony may\r\nbe appreciated.\r\n\r\nNot many marriages between prisoners and Englishwomen are recorded at\r\nWincanton, for the same reason that ruled elsewhere—that the French law\r\nrefused to regard such marriages as valid.\r\n\r\nAlberto Bioletti, an Italian servant to a French officer, married and\r\nsettled in the town as a hairdresser. He married twice, and died in\r\n1869, aged ninety-two. William Bouverie, known as ‘Billy Booby’, married\r\nand settled here. John Peter Pichon is the very French name of one who\r\nmarried Dinah Edwards, both described as of Wincanton, in 1808. In 1809\r\nAndrée Joseph Jantrelle married Mary Hobbs.\r\n\r\nMr. Sweetman says:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Here, as in all other parole towns, a large number of children were\r\nborn out of wedlock whose fathers were reputed to be our visitors. Some\r\nindeed took French names, and several officers had to pay large sums of\r\nmoney to the parish authorities before they left. One of the drawbacks\r\nto the sojourn of so many strangers among us was the increase of\r\nimmorality. One informant said: “Not the least source of attraction to\r\nthese gallant sons of France, were the buxom country maidens, who found\r\ntheir way into the town, but lost their way back. I regret to say that\r\nour little town was becoming a veritable hotbed of vice.”’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were suddenly withdrawn from Wincanton, on account of the\r\nalarm, to which I have alluded elsewhere, that a general rising of the\r\nprisoners of war all over England, but chiefly in the west, had been\r\nconcerted, and partly on account of the large numbers of escapes of\r\nprisoners, favoured as they were by the proximity of the Dorsetshire\r\ncoast with its gangs of smugglers.\r\n\r\nMr. Sweetman continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In February 1812, a company of infantry and a troop of cavalry arrived\r\nat the South Gate, one morning at roll-call time. Before the roll had\r\nbeen completed the troop entered the town and surrounded the captives.\r\nThe infantry followed, and those who had not presented themselves at\r\nroll-call were sent for. So sudden had been the call, that although many\r\nhad wished for years to leave, they were unprepared when the time came.\r\nAt 4 o’clock those who were ready departed; some had not even\r\nbreakfasted, and no one was allowed to have any communication with them.\r\nThey were marched to Mere, where they passed the night in the church.\r\nEarly next morning, those who were left behind, after having bestowed\r\ntheir goods (for many of them had furnished their own houses), followed\r\ntheir brethren, and, joining them at Mere, were marched to Kelso. Deep\r\nwas the regret of many of the inhabitants at losing so many to whom they\r\nhad become endeared by ties of interest and affection. A great gap was\r\nmade in the life of the town which it took years to fill.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventeen burials are recorded in the Wincanton registers from the end\r\nof July 1806 to the end of May 1811.\r\n\r\nProminent prisoners at Wincanton were M. de Tocqueville, Rear-Admiral de\r\nWailly-Duchemin, and Rochambeau, whom Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, in his\r\nstory _The Westcotes_, the scene of which he lays at ‘Axcester’—i.e.\r\nWincanton—paints as quite an admirable old soldier. It was the\r\nabove-named rear-admiral who, dying at Wincanton, lay in state in the\r\npanelled ‘Orange Room’ of _The Dogs_. This is now the residence of Dr.\r\nEdwards, who kindly allowed me to inspect the paintings on the panels of\r\nthis and the adjoining room, which were executed by French officers\r\nquartered here, and represent castles and landscapes, and a caricature\r\nof Wellington, whose head is garnished with donkey’s ears.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Orange Room’ is so called from the tradition that Dutch William\r\nslept here on his way from Torbay to London to assume the British crown.\r\n\r\nLater on a hundred and fifty of the French officers captured at\r\nTrafalgar and in Sir Richard Strachan’s subsequent action, were\r\nquartered here, and are described as ‘very orderly, and inoffensive to\r\nthe inhabitants’.\r\n\r\nThe suicide mentioned above was that of an officer belonging to a highly\r\nrespectable family in France, who, not having heard from home for a long\r\ntime, became so depressed that he went into a field near his lodgings,\r\nplaced the muzzle of a musket in his mouth, and pushed the trigger with\r\nhis foot. The coroner’s jury returned a verdict of ‘Lunacy’.\r\n\r\nI have said that the frequency of escapes among the prisoners was one of\r\nthe causes of their removal from Wincanton. The Commissary, Mr. George\r\nMessiter, in November 1811 asked the Government to break up the Dépôt,\r\nas, on account of the regularly organized system established between the\r\nprisoners and the smugglers and fishermen of the Dorsetshire coast, it\r\nwas impossible to prevent escapes. Towards the close of 1811 no fewer\r\nthan twenty-two French prisoners got away from Wincanton. The\r\nCommissary’s request was at once answered, and the _Salisbury Journal_\r\nof December 9, 1811, thus mentions the removal:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘On Saturday last upwards of 150 French prisoners lately on their parole\r\nat Wincanton were marched by way of Mere through this city under an\r\nescort of the Wilts Militia and a party of Light Dragoons, on their way\r\nto Gosport, there to be embarked with about 50 superior officers for\r\nsome place in Scotland. Since Culliford, the leader of the gang of\r\nsmugglers and fishermen who aided in these escapes, was convicted and\r\nonly sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, they have become more and\r\nmore daring in their violations of the law.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ASHBY-DE-LA-ZOUCH\r\n\r\nAshby occupies an interesting page in that little-known chapter of\r\nBritish history which deals with the prisoners of war who have lived\r\namongst us, and I owe my cordial thanks to the Rev. W. Scott, who has\r\npreserved this page from oblivion, for permission to make use of his\r\npamphlet.\r\n\r\nIn September 1804, the first detachment of prisoners, forty-two in\r\nnumber, reached Ashby, and this number was gradually increased until it\r\nreached its limit, 200. The first arrivals were poor fellows who had to\r\nboard and lodge themselves on about ten shillings and sixpence a week;\r\nbut the later officers from Pampeluna had money concealed about their\r\nclothing and in the soles of their boots.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Mr. Scott says, they seem to have had a tolerably good\r\ntime in Ashby. Their favourite walk was past the Mount Farm near the\r\nCastle, along the Packington Road, then to the left to the Leicester\r\nRoad, across the fields even now sometimes called ‘The Frenchman’s\r\nWalk’, but more generally, Packington Slang. The thirty-shilling reward\r\noffered to any one who should report a prisoner as being out of bounds\r\nwas very rarely claimed, for the officers were such general favourites\r\nthat few persons could be found who, even for thirty shillings, could be\r\nbase enough to play the part of informer.\r\n\r\nAn indirect evidence of the good feeling existing between the\r\ntownspeople and their guests is afforded by the story of two dogs. One\r\nof these, named Mouton, came with the first prisoners in 1804, spent ten\r\nyears in Ashby, and returned with the men in 1814. The other dog came\r\nwith the officers from Pampeluna, and was the only dog who had survived\r\nthe siege. Both animals were great pets with the people of Ashby.\r\n\r\nThere seem to have been at least two duels. Mr. Measures, a farmer of\r\nPackington, on coming to attend to some cattle in Packington Slang, saw\r\na cloak lying on the ground, and upon removing it was horrified to see\r\nthe body of a French officer. It proved to be that of Captain Colvin. He\r\nwas buried in the churchyard of Packington, and, honour being satisfied,\r\nthe man who had slain him was one of the chief mourners. There is a\r\nbrief entry of another duel in Dr. James Kirkland’s records: ‘Monsieur\r\nDenègres, a French prisoner, killed in a duel, Dec. 6th, 1808.’\r\n\r\nGood friends as the prisoners were with the male inhabitants of the\r\ntown, and with the neighbouring farmers, who on more than one occasion\r\nlent horses to officers who wished to escape, it was with the ladies\r\nthat they were prime favourites. One of the prisoners, Colonel Van Hoof,\r\nwas the admirer of Miss Ingle, the reigning beauty of Ashby. The\r\ncourtesy and good nature of the prisoners bore down all obstacles; and\r\nthe only ill-wishers they had were the local young dandies whose noses\r\nthey put out of joint. The married dames were also pleased and\r\nflattered: many of the prisoners were excellent cooks, and one who made\r\na soup which was the envy and despair of every housekeeper in Ashby,\r\nwhen asked by a lady the secret of it, said: ‘I get some pearl barley\r\nand carry it here several days,’ placing his hand melodramatically over\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the mile-limit regulation, they went to picnics in Ashby Old\r\nParks, riding in wagons, and going along the tram road which ran from\r\nWillesley to Ticknall. On these occasions the officers were accompanied\r\nby the better class girls of the town and their admirers. Music was\r\nsupplied by one of the Frenchmen who played a violin. For this or for\r\nsome other reason he seems to have been a first favourite. When passing\r\nthrough the tunnel underneath Ashby Old Parks Hill, it was no unusual\r\nthing for him to lay aside his fiddle to kiss the girls. Of course, they\r\nalways asked him to play while in the tunnel in order to keep him from\r\nobliging them in this manner, and of course he would know what they\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\nThe permanent result of this love-making is shown by the parish register\r\nof Ashby; from 1806 to June 1, 1814, the following weddings took place\r\nbetween local girls and French ‘Prisoners of War resident in this\r\nParish’, or ‘on parole in this Parish’:\r\n\r\n 1806.  Francis Robert to Jane Bedford.\r\n\r\n  〃     Pierre Serventie to Elizabeth Rowbottom.\r\n\r\n  〃     Anthony Hoffmann to Elizabeth Peach.\r\n\r\n 1809.  Louis Jean to Elizabeth Edwards.\r\n\r\n 1810.  Francis Picard to Charlotte Bedford.\r\n\r\n  〃     Henry Antoine to Sarah Roberts.\r\n\r\n  〃     Pierre Geffroy to Phillis Parkins\r\n\r\n 1812.  Casimir Gantreuil to Elizabeth Adcock.\r\n\r\n  〃     Louis François Le Normand Kegrist to Mary Ann Kirkland.\r\n\r\n  〃     Louis Adoré Tiphenn to Ann Vaun.\r\n\r\n  〃     Frederic Rouelt to Ann Sharp.\r\n\r\n 1813.  Auguste Louis Jean Segoivy to Elizabeth Bailey.\r\n\r\n  〃     Francis Peyrol to Martha Peach.\r\n\r\n 1814.  Francis Victor Richard Ducrocq to Sarah Adcock.\r\n\r\n  〃     Richard le Tramp to Mary Sharpe.\r\n\r\nTwo Masonic Lodges and a Rose Croix Chapter were established in\r\nAshby—the above-mentioned Louis Jean was a member of the ‘Vrais Amis de\r\nl’Ordre’ Lodge, and four relics of his connexion are still preserved.\r\nTradition says that the constitution of the Lodge was celebrated by a\r\nball given by the French officers, the hosts presenting to each lady two\r\npairs of white gloves, one pair long, the other short.\r\n\r\nThe second Lodge was ‘De la Justice et de l’Union’.\r\n\r\nWhen Peace was declared, the French Masons at Ashby disposed of their\r\nLodge furniture to the ‘Royal Sussex’, No. 353, of Repton, in\r\nDerbyshire. In 1869 the Lodge removed to Winshill, Burton-on-Trent,\r\nwhere the furniture is still used.\r\n\r\nThere is the register of three burials:\r\n\r\n 1806.  Étienne Lenon.\r\n\r\n 1807.  François Rabin.\r\n\r\n 1808.  Xavier Mandelier.\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere, the Frenchmen gave proofs of their skill in fine\r\nhandiwork. They did ornamental work in several new houses; they taught\r\nthe townsfolk the art of crochet-work (I quote from Mr. Scott); they\r\nwere artists, carvers, &c. Some of the officers worshipped in the\r\nBaptist Church, and became members of it. The conversion of Captain Le\r\nJeune is an interesting little story. Shocked by certain phases and\r\nfeatures of the Roman Catholic religion, he became a deist and finally\r\nan atheist, and during the Revolution joined readily in the\r\nill-treatment of priests. At San Domingo he was taken prisoner in 1804,\r\nand sent to Ashby on parole. Four years later the death of his father\r\nvery deeply impressed him, and he began to think seriously about the\r\nexistence of God. A fellow prisoner, De Serre, a member of the Baptist\r\nChurch in Ashby, a devout Christian, became intimate with him, persuaded\r\nhim to join the Church, and he finally became an active and zealous\r\nmissionary in his own country; and until his death corresponded with the\r\nAshby pastors, and particularly with the Rev. Joseph Goadly, who\r\nexercised an wholesome and powerful influence among the French prisoners\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n                PAROLE LIFE: SUNDRY NOTES (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ASHBURTON, DEVON\r\n\r\nMr. J. H. Amery says in _Devon Notes and Queries_:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We can hardly credit the fact that so little reliable information or\r\neven traditional legend, remains in the small inland market towns where\r\nso many officers were held prisoners on parole until as recently as\r\n1815. It certainly speaks well for their conduct, for had any tragedy\r\nbeen connected with their stay, tradition would have preserved its\r\nmemory and details. For several years prior to 1815 a number of educated\r\nforeigners formed a part of the society of our towns. At one time they\r\nwere lively Frenchmen, at others sober Danes or spendthrift Americans.\r\nThey lodged and boarded in the houses of our tradesmen; they taught the\r\nyoung people modern languages, music and dancing; they walked our\r\nstreets and roads, and took a general interest in passing events; yet\r\nto-day hardly a trace can be discovered of their presence beyond a few\r\nneglected mile-stones on our country roads, and here and there a grave\r\nin our Parish churchyards. This is particularly the case with\r\nAshburton.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that he got more information about the American\r\nprisoners at Ashburton from a Bostonian who was at the post-office\r\nthere, making inquiries, than from anyone else. This Bostonian’s\r\ngrandfather was a naval surgeon who had been captured on the _Polly_;\r\nhad been sent to Dartmoor, but was released on parole to Ashburton.\r\n\r\nMr. Amery gives as an instance of this local indifference to the past\r\nthe fact that the family of Mr. Joseph Gribble, solicitor and county\r\ncoroner, who had been prisoner agent at Ashburton, had lived opposite to\r\nthe entrance to the vicarage until 1899, but that by that time\r\neverything about the prisoners had been forgotten by them.\r\n\r\nMr. Amery writes to me:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I have heard our people say that my great-uncle who lived here at that\r\ntime used to have open house for the prisoners on parole. The French\r\nwere very nice and gentlemanly, but the Americans were a much rougher\r\nlot, and broke up things a good deal. The French used to teach French\r\nand dancing in the town.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Masonic Petition from Ashburton is interesting:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ashburton, April 6, 1814, of our Lord, and in Masonry 5814. To the\r\nGrand Master, Grand Wardens, and Members of the Grand Lodge, London.\r\n\r\n ‘BRETHREN,\r\n\r\n‘We, the undersigned, being Ancient York Masons, take the liberty of\r\naddressing you with this Petition for our Relief, being American\r\nprisoners of war on parole at this place. We are allowed 10_s._ 6_d._\r\nper week for our support. In this place we cannot get lodgings for less\r\nthan 3_s._ per week, and from that to 5_s._ per week. Meat is constantly\r\nfrom 9_d._ to 1_s._ per lb., and other necessaries in proportion. Judge,\r\nbrethren, how we live, for none of us have any means of getting money.\r\nOur clothes are wearing out, and God knows how long we shall be kept\r\nhere; many of us have been captured 9 or 10 months, as you will see\r\nopposite our signatures. We form a body in this place by ourselves for\r\nthe purpose of lecturing each other once a week, and have had this in\r\ncontemplation for some time, but have deferred making application until\r\nabsolute want has made it necessary. We therefore pray that you will\r\ntake into consideration and provide some means for our relief. You will\r\nplease address your letter to Edwin Buckannon.\r\n\r\n‘We humbly remain your pennyless brethren.\r\n\r\n        ‘EDWIN BUCKANNON. G. W. BURBANK. PIERSON BALDWIN. WM. MILLER.\r\n           ARCHD. TAYLOR, JUNR. EZRA OBER. WM. SMITH. JAMES LANS. JOHN\r\n           SCHERS.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was also a French Lodge at Ashburton, ‘Des Amis Réunis’, but the\r\nonly record of its existence is a certificate granted to Paul Carcenac,\r\nan initiate. It is roughly drawn by hand on parchment, and is entirely\r\nin French, and, as the recipient is under obligation to affiliate\r\nhimself to some regularly warranted French Lodge immediately on his\r\nreturn to his native land, it would seem that the Lodge at Ashburton was\r\nonly of a temporary or irregular character.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing references to Freemasonry remind us that this universal\r\nbrotherhood was the occasion of many graceful acts during the Great Wars\r\nbetween men of opposing sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TAVISTOCK\r\n\r\nThere were upon an average 150 prisoners here. The Prison Commissioners\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Some of them have made overtures of marriage to women in the\r\nneighbourhood, which the magistrates very properly have taken pains to\r\ndiscourage.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, of course, refers to the ruling of the French Government that it\r\nwould regard such marriages as invalid. That French women sometimes\r\naccompanied their husbands into captivity is evident from not infrequent\r\npetitions such as this:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The French woman at Tavistock requests that Sir Rupert George (Chairman\r\nto the Transport Office) will interest himself to procure rations for\r\nher child who was born at the Dépôt, and is nearly five months old.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OKEHAMPTON\r\n\r\nHere, very little information is obtainable, as very few of the ‘oldest\r\ninhabitant’ type are to be found, and there are very few residents whose\r\nparents have lived there for any length of time—a sign of these\r\nrestless, migrating days which makes one regret that the subject of the\r\nforeign prisoners of war in Britain was not taken up before the movement\r\nof the rural world into large towns had fairly set in. One old resident\r\ncould only say that his father used to talk of from five to six hundred\r\nprisoners being at Okehampton, but in the rural mind numbers are handled\r\nas vaguely as is time, for assuredly in no single parole town in Britain\r\nwere there ever so many prisoners. Another aged resident said:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘They were all bettermost prisoners: the rough ones were kept at\r\nPrincetown, but these were quartered in various houses, and paid very\r\nwell for it. Their bounds were a mile out of town, but I have heard they\r\nwere very artful, and shifted the milestones and borough stones. My\r\nfather told me that one escaped, but he was shot down in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Bovey Clay Works. There was a riot in the town one\r\nday amongst them, and old Dr. Luxmoore, who was a big, tall man, mounted\r\nhis big horse, and, armed with his hunting whip, rode down through the\r\nprisoners, who were fighting in the town, and with the cracks of it\r\ndispersed them in every direction.... The Mess Room was the St. James’\r\nStreet schoolroom, and stood opposite the South entrance of the Arcade\r\nwhich was pulled down a few years ago. In their spare time the prisoners\r\nmade many small articles such as cabinets, chairs, cribbage-boards, and\r\nvarious models of churches and houses. Some taught their languages to\r\nthe inhabitants.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ODIHAM\r\n\r\nGeneral Simon was at Odiham. We have had to do with him before, and he\r\nseems to have been thoroughly bad. He had been concerned with Bernadotte\r\nand Pinoteau in the Conspiracy of Rennes against Bonaparte’s Consular\r\nGovernment, had been arrested, and exiled to the Isle of Rhé for six\r\nyears. When Bonaparte became emperor he liberated Simon and gave him a\r\ncommand. At the battle of Busaco, September 27, 1810, Simon’s brigade\r\nled the division of Loison in its attack on the British position, and\r\nSimon was first man over the entrenchments. ‘We took some prisoners,’\r\nsays George Napier, ‘and among them General Simon. He was horribly\r\nwounded in the face, his jaw being broken and almost hanging on his\r\nchest. Just as myself and another officer came to him a soldier was\r\ngoing to put his bayonet into him, which we prevented, and sent him up\r\nas prisoner to the General.’\r\n\r\nSimon reached England in October 1810, and was sent on parole to Odiham.\r\nThe prisoners lived in houses in Bury Square, opposite the stocks and\r\nthe church, and some old redbrick cottages on the brink of the chalk-pit\r\nat the entrance to the town, all of which are now standing. They\r\nnaturally made the fine old _George_ Inn their social centre, and to\r\nthis day the tree which marked their mile limit along the London road is\r\nknown as ‘Frenchman’s Oak’. Simon absconded from Odiham, and the\r\nadvertisement for him ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘One hundred pounds is offered for the capture of the French general\r\nSimon, styled a baron and a chevalier of the Empire, who lately broke\r\nhis parole and absconded from Odiham.’\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Times_ of Jan. 20, 1812, details his smart capture by the Bow\r\nStreet officers. They went first to Richmond, hearing that two\r\nforeigners of suspicious appearance were there. The information led to\r\nnothing, so they went on to Hounslow, thinking to intercept the\r\nfugitives on their way from Odiham to the Kent Coast, and here they\r\nheard that two Frenchmen had hired a post-chaise to London. This they\r\ntraced to Dover Street, Piccadilly, but the clue was lost. They\r\nremembered that there was a French doctor in Dover Street, but an\r\ninterview with him revealed nothing. On they went to the house of a\r\nMadame Glion, in Pulteney Street, late owner of a Paris diligence, and,\r\nalthough their particular quarry was not there, they ‘ran in’ three\r\nother French ‘broke-paroles’. Information led them to Pratt Street,\r\nCamden Town. A female servant appeared in the area of No. 4 in reply to\r\ntheir knocks, denied that there was any one in the house, and refused\r\nthem admittance. The officers, now reinforced, surrounded the house, and\r\nsome men were seen sitting in a back-parlour by candle-light. Suddenly\r\nthe candles were put out. Lavender, the senior officer, went again to\r\nthe front door and knocked. The servant resisted his pretext of having a\r\nletter for a lady in the house, and he threatened to shoot her if she\r\nstill refused admission. She defied him. Other officers had in the\r\nmeanwhile climbed over the back garden wall and found Simon and another\r\nofficer, Surgeon Boiron, in the kitchen in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe mistress and servant of the house were both Frenchwomen, and they\r\nwere carried off with Simon and Boiron: altogether a capital haul, as\r\nthe women were found upon examination to be ‘deep in the business’ of\r\naiding and abetting in the escape of prisoners. With Simon’s subsequent\r\ncareer I have dealt in the chapter upon Escapes and Escape Agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LEICESTER\r\n\r\nTo Mr. John Thorp of this town I am indebted for the following notes:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In 1756 Count Benville and 30 other French officers were on parole at\r\nLeicester. Most of them were men of high rank, and were all well\r\nreceived by the townpeople.[18] They were polite and agreeable in\r\nmanner, and as they expended about £9,000 during their stay in the town\r\nit was of benefit to a large part of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n‘A number of French prisoners came from Tavistock in 1779, and remained\r\nin the town about six months. They behaved well and produced agreeable\r\nimpressions upon the inhabitants by their light-hearted and amiable\r\nmanners, and, in consequence, were very civilly treated. They were free\r\nfrom boasting, temperate, and even plain in living, and paid the debts\r\nthey had contracted during their residence in the town.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TRAGIC EVENTS\r\n\r\nTragic events were by no means so common among the prisoners on parole\r\nas in the prisons, no doubt because of the greater variety in their\r\nlives, and of their not being so constantly in close company with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA French officer, on parole at Andover in 1811, at what is now Portland\r\nHouse in West Street, fell in love with the daughter of his host, and\r\nupon her rejection of his suit, retired to a summer-house in the garden,\r\nopened a vein in his arm, and bled to death.\r\n\r\nDuels were frequent, and not only would there have been more, had\r\nweapons of offence been procurable, but the results would have been more\r\noften fatal.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 two French officers at Reading fought in a field near the _New\r\nInn_ on the Oxford road. They could not get pistols, but one gun. They\r\ntossed for the first shot with it at fifty paces, and the winner shot\r\nhis opponent through the back of the neck so that he died.\r\n\r\nAt Leek in Staffordshire in the same year, a Captain Decourbes went out\r\nfishing and came in at curfew. At 8 p.m. in the billiard-room of the\r\n_Black’s Head_, a Captain Robert chaffed him about his prowess as an\r\nangler, words were exchanged, and Robert insulted and finally struck\r\nhim. Decourbes, of course, challenged him. The only weapon they could\r\nget was a cavalry horse-pistol which they borrowed from a yeomanry\r\ntrooper. They met at Balidone on October 17. Decourbes won the toss for\r\nfirst shot and hit Robert in the breech. Robert, who had come on to the\r\nground on crutches, then fired and hit Decourbes in the nape of the\r\nneck. Decourbes managed to walk back to Leek, but he died in ten days.\r\n\r\nA very different version of this affair was given in a contemporary\r\n_Times_. According to this, Decourbes, about ten days before the duel,\r\nwas out of his lodgings after the evening bell had rung, and the boys of\r\nLeek collected and pelted him with stones. His behaviour caused one of\r\nhis brother officers to say that he was ‘soft’ and would faint at the\r\nsight of his own blood. Decourbes gave him the lie, the other struck\r\nhim, and the result was a challenge and the duel as described. But the\r\nverdict, ‘Died by the visitation of God,’ was questioned, and the writer\r\nof a letter to _The Times_ declared that there was no evidence of a\r\nduel, as Decourbes’ body was in a putrid state, and that three French\r\nand two English surgeons had declared that he had died from typhus.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 a tragedy was enacted at Chesterfield which caused much stir at\r\nthe time. Colonel Richemont and Captain Méant were fellow prisoners,\r\nreleased from the Chatham hulks, and travelling together to Chesterfield\r\nwhere they were to live on parole. On the road thither they slept at\r\nAtherstone. When Richemont arrived at the Falcon Hotel at Chesterfield\r\nhe found that his trunk had been robbed of a quantity of gold dust, a\r\nvariety of gold coins, and of some gold and silver articles. Suspecting\r\nthat it had been done at the inn in Atherstone, he caused inquiry to be\r\nmade, but without result. He then suspected his fellow traveller Méant,\r\ncaused his box to be searched, and in it found silver spoons and other\r\nof his missing property.\r\n\r\nMéant, on being discovered, tried to stab himself, but, being prevented,\r\nseized a bottle of laudanum and swallowed its contents. Then he wrote a\r\nconfession, and finding that the laudanum was slower in action than he\r\nexpected, tried to stab himself again. A struggle took place; Méant\r\nrefused the emetic brought, and died. Méant’s brother-in-law brought an\r\naction against Richemont, declaring that the latter in reality owed the\r\ndead man a large sum of money, and that Méant had only taken his due.\r\nDuring the trial Colonel Richemont was very violent against the British,\r\nand especially when the jury decided the case against him, and found\r\nthat the dead man was his creditor, although, of course, the means he\r\nemployed to get what was his were illegal.\r\n\r\nMéant was buried, according to usage, at the union of four cross roads\r\njust outside the borough boundary, with a stake driven through his body.\r\nThe funeral took place on a Sunday, and great crowds attended.\r\n\r\nOn April 13, 1812, Pierre de Romfort or De la Roche, a prisoner on\r\nparole at Launceston, was hanged at Bodmin for forgery. ‘He behaved very\r\npenitently, and was attended to at the last moment by Mr. Lefers, a\r\nRoman Catholic priest living at Lanhearne.’\r\n\r\nI quote this because it is one of the very few instances of this crime\r\nbeing committed by a prisoner on parole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        INTERNATIONAL COURTESIES\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to read testimonies such as the following, taken out of\r\nmany, to chivalry and kindness on the part of our enemies, and to note\r\npractical appreciations of such conduct.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Captain Areguandeau of the _Blonde_ privateer, captured at sea\r\nand put on the parole list, was applied for by late British prisoners of\r\nhis to whom he had been kind, to be returned to France unconditionally.\r\nThe Commissioners of the Transport Board regretted that under existing\r\ncircumstances they could not accede to this, but allowed him a choice of\r\nparole towns—Tiverton, Ashbourne, Chesterfield, Leek, or Lichfield.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, Guerbe, second captain of a transport, was allowed to be on\r\nparole although he was not so entitled by his rank, because of his\r\nhumane treatment of Colonel Fraser and other officers and men, lately\r\nhis prisoners.\r\n\r\nLefort, on parole at Tiverton, was allowed to go to France on parole\r\nbecause of his kindly treatment of the wounded prisoners on the\r\n_Hannibal_ (which, after a heroic resistance, ran aground in 1801 at\r\nAlgeciras and was captured).\r\n\r\nIn 1813 Captain Collins of H.M.S. _Surveillante_ successfully obtained\r\nthe unconditional release of Captain Loysel because of the splendid\r\nmanner in which the latter had risked his life in protecting two British\r\nofficers, who were wounded in the unsuccessful first attack on San\r\nSebastian, from being killed by some drunken or infuriated French\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nA French marine officer named Michael Coie, a prisoner on parole, died\r\nat Andover, November 9, 1813. It happened that the 2nd battalion, 5th\r\nRegiment was halting on the march in the town, and the commanding\r\nofficer, Captain Boyle, at once offered to attend the funeral, with the\r\nbattalion, the regimental band at the head. This was done, all the\r\nFrench officers in Andover being present. The act of grace was much\r\nappreciated by the prisoners.\r\n\r\nSo also when General Rufin—a great favourite of Bonaparte, captured at\r\nBarossa in 1811—died in the May of that year on his passage to England,\r\nhis body was interred in the Garrison Chapel at Portsmouth, with every\r\nrank of honour and distinction, minute guns, flags half-mast high, and\r\nthree rounds of nine pieces of cannon at the close.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, an officer on parole at Oswestry was liberated for having\r\nrescued an infant from the paws of a lion.\r\n\r\nThe following is pleasing reading:\r\n\r\nGeneral Barraguay-Hilliers, who with his suite was captured in the\r\n_Sensible_ by H.M.S. _Seahorse_ in June 1798, arrived at Portsmouth in\r\nAugust, and on the very day after his arrival was allowed to go on\r\nparole to France with his aides-de-camp, Lamotte and Vallie. But before\r\nthey could get out of England an amusing incident occurred which\r\nafforded an English gentleman an opportunity for displaying a graceful\r\ncourtesy. The officers reached Lewes _en route_ for Dover, where they\r\nhoped to get a neutral vessel to France, but, as Brighton races were on,\r\nnot for love or money could they get a conveyance to carry them on their\r\njourney. None of them could speak English; they were not allowed by the\r\nterms of their parole to go to London, which they might have done by\r\nmail-coach, so they resolved to send their baggage on by cart, and\r\nthemselves proceed on foot. Sir John Shelley of Maresfield Park heard of\r\ntheir predicament, and at once sent carriages to take them on to Dover.\r\n\r\nIt is also pleasant to read that at Tiverton the French officers on\r\nparole there, with scarcely an exception, conducted themselves in such a\r\nway as to win the esteem and regard of their hosts, and in many cases\r\nlasting friendships were formed with them. After the establishment of\r\nPeace in 1815, some, rather than return to France, remained. Among these\r\nwas M. Alexandre de la Motte, who lived at Tiverton, acquired property\r\nthere, and gained much respect as French master at Blundell’s School.\r\n\r\nThat so gregarious a race as the French should form clubs and\r\nassociations for social purposes among themselves in all circumstances\r\ncan be readily understood, and in almost every parole town some such\r\ninstitution existed, and in no small degree contributed to the\r\nenlivenment of local social life. There were also no less than\r\ntwenty-five lodges and chapters of Freemasons in England, and others in\r\nScotland. Still, the Government, from politic motives, warned their\r\nAgents to keep these institutions under observation, and were disposed\r\nto regard with suspicion such clubs as the ‘Des Amis Réunis’ at\r\nAshburton and Plymouth, the ‘Enfants de Mars et de Neptune’ at\r\nAbergavenny and Tiverton, and others of like character, as being\r\ninstitutions for the fomentation _sub rosâ_ of agitation and\r\ndisaffection. For the same reasons all amusements which gathered crowds\r\nwere discouraged among the prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n                                VARIORUM\r\n\r\n\r\n                (1) SOME DISTINGUISHED PRISONERS OF WAR\r\n\r\nWhen the roll of the 46th Regiment (or, as it was, the 46th\r\ndemi-brigade), of the French Army is called, the name of La Tour\r\nd’Auvergne brings forward the sergeant-major of the Grenadier Company,\r\nwho salutes and replies: ‘Dead upon the field of honour!’\r\n\r\nThis unique homage to Théophile de La Tour d’Auvergne—who won the\r\ndistinguishing title of ‘First Grenadier of the Republican Armies’ in an\r\nage and an army crowded with brave men, quite as much, so says history,\r\nby his modesty as by his bravery in action—was continued for some time\r\nafter his death in 1800, was discontinued, was revived in 1887, and has\r\nbeen paid ever since.\r\n\r\nIn 1795, after the taking of San Sebastian by the French, he applied for\r\nleave of absence on account of his health, and started by sea for his\r\nnative Brittany, but the ship in which he sailed was captured by British\r\ncruisers. He was brought to England and sent to Bodmin on parole. Here\r\nhe insisted upon wearing his Republican cockade, a silly, unnecessary\r\nact of bravado which so annoyed some English soldiers that they mobbed\r\nhim, and, as he showed a disposition to resent the attack, matters would\r\nhave gone hard with him but for timely rescue. (I reproduce a picture of\r\none of these attacks from his biography by Montorgueil, not on account\r\nof its merit, but of its absurdity. La Tour d’Auvergne, it will be\r\nnoted, uses his sword toasting-fork wise. Not even the most\r\ndistinguished of parole prisoners was ever allowed to wear his sword,\r\nalthough some were not required to give them up according to rule.) This\r\ninspired the following letter from him to the Agent at Bodmin:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LA TOUR D’AUVERGNE DEFENDING HIS COCKADE AT BODMIN\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     ‘1st October, 1795.\r\n\r\n ‘SIR,\r\n\r\n‘I address myself to you as the Agent entrusted by your Government with\r\nthe immediate care of the French prisoners at Bodmin, to acquaint you\r\nwith the outrage just perpetrated upon me by some soldiers of the\r\ngarrison in this town, who, on their return from drill, attacked me with\r\ntheir arms, and proceeded to violent extremes with the object of\r\ndepriving me of my cockade, a distinctive part of my military uniform. I\r\nhave always worn it during my detention in England, just as your\r\nofficers, prisoners in my country, have always worn theirs without being\r\ninterfered with. It is impossible, Sir, that such behaviour towards an\r\nofficer of the French Republic should have been encouraged by your\r\nGovernment, or that it should countenance any outrage upon peaceable\r\nprisoners who are here under your protection. Under these circumstances,\r\nSir, I beg you without delay to get to the root of the insult to which I\r\nhave been subjected, so that I may be able to adapt my conduct in future\r\naccordingly. Into whatever extremity I may find myself reduced by my\r\ndetermination not to remove my distinctive badge, I shall never regard\r\nas a misfortune the ills and interferences of which the source will have\r\nbeen so honourable to me.’\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Agent was probably much the same as the Transport\r\nOffice made in 1804 to a letter from the Agent at Leek, in\r\nStaffordshire, to whom a French midshipman had complained of similar\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘We think the French midshipman very imprudent in wearing his Cockade,\r\nas it could answer no good purpose, and might expose him to evils\r\ngreater than he has already experienced from the rage of the populace,\r\nand you are to inform him if he persists he must not expect protection\r\nfrom the consequences.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the inhabitants of Bishop’s Waltham complained of the constant\r\nwearing by the prisoners there of Republican cockades, and the reply was\r\nexactly as above.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall La Tour d’Auvergne occupied himself with literary pursuits,\r\nespecially with philology, and was pleased and interested to find how\r\nmuch there was in common between phrases and words of Cornwall, and\r\nthose of Brittany. Concerning his captivity he wrote thus to Le Coz,\r\nArchbishop of Besançon:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘I will not bother you with an account of all I have had to suffer from\r\nthe English during a year of captivity, they being no doubt egged on by\r\nour French é[migrés] and p[rinces]. My Republican spirit finds it hard\r\nto dissemble and to adapt itself to circumstances, so I shall show\r\nmyself to be what I always have been, Frenchman and patriot. The revered\r\nsymbol of my nation, the tricolour cockade, was always on my hat, and\r\nthe dress I wore _dans les fers_ was that which I wore in battle. Hence\r\nthe hatred let loose against me and the persecutions which I have had to\r\nendure.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHe returned to France from Penryn, February 19, 1796, and was killed at\r\nOberhausen in Bavaria in June 1800.\r\n\r\nFrom the following extract from Legard’s biography, and from the phrase\r\n_dans les fers_ which I have italicized above, La Tour d’Auvergne would\r\nseem to have been in prison, possibly for persistent adherence to\r\ncockade-wearing:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘It was horrible to see the misery of so many brave Frenchmen, crammed\r\ninto unwholesome dungeons, struggling against every sort of want,\r\nexposed to every rigour and every vexation imaginable, and devoured by\r\ncruel maladies. La Tour d’Auvergne kept up their courage, helped them in\r\nevery way, shared his money with them, and was indignant to hear how\r\nagents of the Government tried to seduce them from their fidelity,\r\ncorrupt them, and show them how hateful was the French Government.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Trafalgar the Spanish prisoners were confined at Gibraltar, the\r\nFrench, numbering 210 officers and 4,589 men, were brought to England.\r\nThe rank and file who were landed at Portsmouth were imprisoned at\r\nForton, Portchester, and in seven hulks; those at Plymouth in the\r\nMillbay Prison and eight hulks; those at Chatham in four hulks. The\r\nofficers from the captured ships _Fougueux_, _Aigle_, _Mont-Blanc_,\r\n_Berwick_, _Scipion_, _Formidable_, _Intrépide_, _Achille_, and _Duguay\r\nTrouin_, were sent to Crediton and Wincanton.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Villeneuve and his suite were first at Bishop’s Waltham, where\r\nhe was bound by the ordinary rules of a prisoner on parole, except that\r\nhis limits were extended; he was allowed to visit Lord Clanricarde, and\r\nto retain, but not to wear, his arms.\r\n\r\nHe had asked to be sent to London, but, although this was not granted\r\nhim, he was allowed to choose any town for parole, north or west of\r\nLondon, but not within thirty miles.\r\n\r\nHe had leave to visit any of the neighbouring nobility and gentry, and\r\nhis lieutenants could go three miles in any direction. He chose Reading,\r\nwhich was not then a regular parole town, although it became one later.\r\nHither he went with Majendie, his captain, whose third experience it was\r\nof captivity in England (he had been actually taken prisoner five times,\r\nand had served two years, one month, twenty-five days as prisoner in\r\nEngland), Lucas of the _Redoutable_, and Infernet of the _Intrépide_.\r\nVilleneuve and Majendie attended Nelson’s funeral in London, and a\r\nlittle later Majendie had permission to go to France to try to arrange\r\nsome definite system of prisoner-exchange between the two countries. In\r\nMarch 1806 Villeneuve was exchanged for four post-captains, and went to\r\nFrance with his officers and suite on the condition that once in every\r\ntwo months he gave notice to a British agent of his place of residence,\r\nand was not to change the same without notifying it.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival in Paris Villeneuve found that Lucas and Infernet had\r\nbeen much honoured by Bonaparte and made rear-admirals. No notice was\r\ntaken of him by Bonaparte, who had always disliked and despised him, and\r\none day he was found stabbed at the Hôtel de la Patrie, Rennes.\r\nBonaparte was suspected of foul play, and again was heard the saying,\r\n‘How fortunate Napoleon is! All his enemies die of their own accord!’ At\r\nSt. Helena, however, Bonaparte strenuously denied the imputation.\r\n\r\nLucas, captain of the _Redoutable_, the ship whence Nelson received his\r\ndeath-shot, was at Tiverton. His heroic defence, his fight against the\r\n_Téméraire_ and the _Victory_ at the same time, resulting in a loss out\r\nof 645 men of 300 killed and 222 wounded, are among the immortal deeds\r\nof that famous day. Only 169 of his men were made prisoners, and of\r\nthese only 35 came to England; the rest, being wounded, went down with\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nVilleneuve said when he wrote to congratulate Lucas upon being honoured\r\nby Bonaparte:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Si tous les capitaines de vaisseaux s’étaient conduits comme vous, à\r\nTrafalgar, la victoire n’eût pas été un instant indécisive, certainement\r\npersonne ne le sait aussi bien que moi.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHis conduct was so much appreciated in England, that at a supper given\r\nhim by Lady Warren his sword was returned to him.\r\n\r\nRear-Admiral Dumanoir of the _Formidable_ was also at Tiverton. Although\r\nhe fought at Trafalgar, he was not captured there, as it was thought in\r\nmany quarters he should have been or have died with his ship. From\r\nTiverton he wrote, with permission, under date of January 2, 1806, to\r\n_The Times_, replying to some rather severe remarks which had been made\r\nin that paper concerning his behaviour at Trafalgar, tantamount to\r\nsaying that during the greater part of the battle he had remained a mere\r\npassive spectator. It is not necessary to relate the facts, which are\r\nfully given by James, the naval historian.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 he had special leave to go on parole to France to defend\r\nhimself, but the Transport Office refused to allow three captains and\r\ntwo adjutants to go with him, because of the continual refusal of the\r\nFrench Government to release British prisoners. At first he was not\r\nallowed to take even his secretary, a non-combatant, but later this was\r\npermitted. The Court Martial in France acquitted him, and in 1811 he was\r\nmade a vice-admiral and Governor of Danzig, and behaved with great\r\ncredit during the siege of that city by the Allies in 1814. In connexion\r\nwith this, it is interesting to note that the only British naval flag\r\ntrophy at the Invalides in Paris was captured by Dumanoir at Danzig.\r\n\r\nIt is not out of place here to note that Cartigny, the last French\r\nsurvivor of Trafalgar, who died at Hyères in 1892, aged 101, had a\r\nconsiderable experience of war-prisoner life, for, besides having been\r\non a Plymouth hulk, he was at Dartmoor and at Stapleton. He attended the\r\nPrince Imperial’s funeral at Chislehurst in 1879.\r\n\r\nMarienier, a black general, captured at San Domingo, was, with his four\r\nwives, brought to Portsmouth. The story is that, being entitled to\r\nparole by his rank, when the Agent presented him the usual form for\r\nsignature, he said: ‘Je ne connais pas le mystère de la plume; c’est par\r\nceci (touching the hilt of his sword) que je suis parvenu au grade que\r\nje tiens. Voilà mon aide-de-camp; il sait écrire, et il signera pour\r\nmoi.’\r\n\r\nTallien, Revolutionist writer, prominent Jacobin, agent of the Terror in\r\nBordeaux, and largely responsible for the downfall of Robespierre, was\r\ncaptured on his way home from Egypt, whither he had gone with\r\nBonaparte’s expedition. As he was a non-combatant he was only a prisoner\r\na short time, and went to London, where he was lionized by the Whig\r\nparty. He married Madame de Fontenai, whose salon in Paris was the most\r\nbrilliant of the Directory period, and where Bonaparte first met Madame\r\nde Beauharnais.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 François, nephew of the great actor Talma, was taken prisoner.\r\nHe was nobody in particular, but his case is interesting inasmuch as his\r\nrelease on January 1, 1812, was largely brought about by the interest of\r\nTalma’s great friend, John Kemble.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Count Linois was as worthy a prisoner as he had proved himself\r\nmany times a worthy foe. A French writer describes him as having\r\ndisplayed during his captivity a philosophic resignation; and even the\r\nstony-hearted Transport Board, in acceding to his request that his wife\r\nshould be allowed to join him at Bath, complimented him on his behaviour\r\n‘which has formed a very satisfactory contrast to that of many officers\r\nof high rank, by whom a similar indulgence has been abused.’\r\n\r\nLucien, Bonaparte’s second brother, was a prisoner in England, but very\r\nnominally, from 1810 to 1814. He could not fall in with the grand and\r\nambitious ideas of his brother so far as they touched family matters.\r\nBonaparte, having made his brothers all princes, considered that they\r\nshould marry accordingly. Lucien married the girl he loved; his brother\r\nresented it, and passed the Statute of March 30, 1806, by which it was\r\nenacted that ‘Marriages of the Imperial Family shall be null and void if\r\ncontracted without the permission of the Emperor, as the princes ought\r\nto be devoted without reserve to the great interests of the country, and\r\nthe glory of our house.’ He wanted Lucien to marry the Queen of Etruria,\r\nwidow of Louis I, Prince of Parma, a match which, when Tuscany should be\r\nannexed to the Empire, would mean that their throne would be that of\r\nSpain and the Indies.\r\n\r\nSo Lucien sailed for the United States, but was captured by a British\r\ncruiser carried to Malta, and thence to England. He was sent on parole\r\nto Ludlow, where he lived at Dinham House. Then he bought Thorngrove,\r\nnear Worcester, where he lived until 1814, and where he wrote\r\n_Charlemagne, ou l’Église sauvée_.\r\n\r\nCambronne, wounded at the head of the Imperial Guard at Waterloo, and\r\nreputed author of a famous _mot_ which he never uttered, was for two\r\nhours on a Portsmouth hulk, but was soon placed on parole, and was at\r\nAshburton in Devonshire until November 1815. The grand-daughter of Mrs.\r\nEddy, at whose house Cambronne lodged, still preserves at the _Golden\r\nLion_ a portrait of the general, given by him to Mrs. Eddy. From England\r\nhe wrote to Louis XVIII, professing loyalty, and offering his services,\r\nbut on his arrival in Paris was brought up for trial on these counts:\r\n\r\n(1) Having betrayed the King. (2) Having made an armed attack on France.\r\n(3) Having procured aid for Bonaparte by violence. He was adjudged Not\r\nGuilty on all three.\r\n\r\nAdmiral De Winter, Commander of the Dutch fleet at Camperdown, was a\r\nprisoner for a year in England, but I cannot learn where. It is\r\ngratifying to read his appreciation of the kindly treatment he received,\r\nas expressed in his speech at his public entry into Amsterdam after his\r\nrelease in December 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The fortune of war previously forced me to live abroad, and, being\r\nsince then for the first time vanquished by the enemy, I have\r\nexperienced a second state of exile. However mortifying to the feelings\r\nof a man who loves his country, the satisfactory treatment I met with on\r\nthe part of the enemy, the English, and the humane and faithful support\r\nand assistance they evinced towards my worthy countrymen and fellow\r\nsufferers, have considerably softened the horrors of my situation. Nay!\r\nWorthy burghers! I must not conceal from you that the noble liberality\r\nof the English nation since this bloody contest justly entitles them to\r\nyour admiration.’\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Winter’s flag-ship, the _Vryheid_, was for many years a hulk at\r\nChatham.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (2) SOME STATISTICS\r\n\r\nStatistics are wearisome, but, in order that readers may form some idea\r\nof the burden cast on the country by the presence of prisoners of war, I\r\ngive a few figures.\r\n\r\nDuring the Seven Years’ War the annual average number of prisoners of\r\nwar in England was 18,800, although the total of one year, 1762, was\r\n26,137. This, it must be remembered, was before the regular War Prison\r\nbecame an institution, so that the burden was directly upon the people\r\namong whom the prisoners were scattered. Of these, on an average, about\r\n15,700 were in prisons healthy, and 1,200 sick; 1,850 were on parole\r\nhealthy, and 60 sick. The total net cost of these prisoners was\r\n£1,174,906. The total number of prisoners brought to Britain between the\r\nyears 1803 and 1814 was 122,440. Of these 10,341 died whilst in\r\ncaptivity, and 17,607 were exchanged or sent home sick or on parole. The\r\ncost of these was £6,800,000.\r\n\r\nThe greatest number of prisoners at one time in Britain was about 72,000\r\nin 1814.\r\n\r\nThe average mortality was between one and three per cent., but epidemics\r\n(such as that which at Dartmoor during seven months of 1809 and 1810\r\ncaused 422 deaths—more than double the total of nineteen ordinary\r\nmonths—and that at Norman Cross in 1801 from which, it is said, no less\r\nthan 1,000 prisoners died) brought up the percentages of particular\r\nyears very notably. Thus, during the six years and seven months of\r\nDartmoor’s existence as a war-prison, there were 1,455 deaths, which,\r\ntaking the average number of prisoners as 5,600, works out at about four\r\nper cent., but the annual average was not more than two and a quarter\r\nper cent., except in the above-quoted years. The average mortality on\r\nthe prison ships was slightly higher, working out all round at about\r\nthree per cent., but here again epidemics made the percentages of\r\nparticular years jump, as at Portsmouth in 1812, when the average of\r\ndeaths rose to about four per cent.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the sickness-rate of officers on parole was higher than\r\nthat of prisoners in confinement. Taking at random the year 1810, for\r\nexample, we find that at one time out of 45,940 prisoners on the hulks\r\nand in prisons, only 320 were in hospital, while at the same time of\r\n2,710 officers on parole no less than 165 were on the sick-list.\r\nPossibly the greater prevalence of duels among the latter may account\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (3) EPITAPHS OF PRISONERS\r\n\r\nI do not claim completeness for the following list, for neglect has\r\nallowed the obliteration of many stones in our churchyards which\r\ntraditionally mark the last resting-places of prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nAt New Alresford, Hampshire, on the west side of the church:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ici repose le corps de M. Joseph Hypolite Riouffe, enseigne de vaisseau\r\nde la Marine Impériale et Royale qui mourut le 12 Dec. 1810, âgé 28 ans.\r\nIl emporta les regrets de tous ses camarades et personnes qui le\r\nconnurent.’\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ci-gît le corps de M.

Davoust of the Navy,\r\nson of the General, and Midshipmen Meunier, Berthot, and Birtin—the\r\nlast-named was a prisoner eleven years, and ‘behaved extremely well’.\r\nAlso there are registered the burials of Jean le Roche, in 1810, aged\r\n44, J. B. Lahouton, died 1806, aged 28; ‘C.A.G. A French Prisoner’ in\r\n1812, aged 62; and Alexander Gay, in 1850.\r\n\r\nAt Okehampton, Devon:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Cette pierre fut élevée par l’amitié à la mémoire d’Armand Bernard, né\r\nau Havre en Normandie, marié à Calais à Mlle Margot; deuxième officier\r\nde commerce, décédé Prisonnier de Guerre à Okehampton, le 26 Oct. 1815.\r\nAgé 33 ans.\r\n\r\n             A l’abri des vertus qui distinguaient la vie,\r\n             Tu reposes en paix, ombre tendre et chérie.’\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ci-gît Adelaïde Barrin de Puyleanne de la Commune de Montravers, Dép^t\r\ndes Deux-Sèvres, née le 21 Avril 1771, décédée à Okehampton le 18 Fév.\r\n1811. Ici repose la mère et l’enfant.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the churchyards of Wincanton and Andover are stones to the memories\r\nof Russian and Polish officers.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard at Tenterden, Kent, there is a tomb upon which is\r\ncarved a ship and a recumbent figure, with the epitaph:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Hier Legt Begraven Schipper Siebe Nannes, Van de Jower in Vriesland, is\r\nin den Heere Gernstden, 8 November, 1781. Oudt 47 Jaren.’ On the other\r\nside is inscribed:\r\n\r\n\r\n           ‘As he’s the first, the neighbours say, that lies\r\n           First of War captives buried in this place:\r\n           So may he hope to be the first to rise\r\n           And gain the Mansions of Eternal Peace.’\r\n\r\nBy the way, it may be remarked, in association with the above Dutch\r\nburial, that there are to-day in Tenterden work-people named\r\nVanlanschorten, who are said to be descended from a prisoner of war.\r\n\r\nAt Bishop’s Castle church, in Montgomeryshire, there is a stone opposite\r\nthe belfry door inscribed:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A la Mémoire de Louis Pages, Lieut.-Col. des chevaux-légers; chevalier\r\ndes ordres militaires des Deux Siciles et d’Espagne. Mort à Bishop’s\r\nCastle le 1^{er} Mai 1814, âgé de 40 ans.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Register of the same church is recorded the baptism of a son of\r\nAntoine Marie Jeanne Ary Bandart, Captain of the 4th Regiment of Light\r\nInfantry, Member of the Legion of Honour, a prisoner of war; and fifteen\r\nmonths later the burial of the child. These are in 1813 and 1814. In the\r\nlatter year also is recorded the baptism of a son of Joseph and Maria\r\nMoureux.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard of Moreton-Hampstead, Devon, are ranged against the\r\nwall stones with the following epitaphs:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A la mémoire de Louis Ambroise Quanti, Lieut, du 44 Rég^t du Corps\r\nImpérial d’Artillerie de Marine. Agé de 33 ans. Décédé le 29 Avril\r\n1809.’ The Masonic compass and dividers follow the inscription.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Ici repose le corps de M. Armand Aubry, Lieut, du 70^{me} Rég^t\r\nd’Infanterie de Ligne. Agé de 42 ans. Décédé le 10 Juin 1811. Priez Dieu\r\npour le repos de son âme.’ This is followed by two crossed swords.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘A la mémoire de Jean François Roil; Aspirant de la Marine Impériale,\r\nâgé de 21 ans. Décédé le 22 Janvier 1811.’ This has as emblem a sword\r\nand anchor crossed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are still in Moreton-Hampstead two shops bearing the name of\r\nRihll. To the register-entries of two of the above deaths is added:\r\n‘These were buried in Wooling, according to Act of Parliament.’\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard of Ashburton, Devon, is a stone thus inscribed:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  ‘Ici\r\n\r\nRepose François Guidon natif de Cambrai en France, Sous-Lieutenant au\r\n46^{me} Rég^t de Ligne. Décédé le 18 7bre 1815. Agé de 22 ans.\r\nRequiescat in Pace.’\r\n\r\n\r\nAt East Dereham, Norfolk:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘In memory of Jean de la Narde, son of a notary public of Saint Malo, a\r\nFrench prisoner of war, who, having escaped from the bell tower of this\r\nChurch, was pursued and shot by a soldier on duty. October 6th, 1799.\r\nAged 28.’\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Webb, of Andover, sends me the following registrations of death:\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. Alline. Prisoner of War. March 18, 1802.\r\n\r\nNicholas Ockonloff. Prisoner of War. March 19, 1808.\r\n\r\nMichael Coie. Prisoner of War. November 9, 1813. [For an account of his\r\nfuneral see pp. 439–40.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Odiham, in Hampshire, are the graves of two French prisoners of war.\r\nWhen I visited them in August 1913, the inscriptions had been repainted\r\nand a memorial wreath laid upon each grave. The inscriptions are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Cy-gît Piere Feron, Capitaine au 66^e Régiment de Ligne, Chevalier de\r\nl’Empire Français, né à Reims, Départ^t de la Marne, le 15 Août 1766,\r\ndécédé à Odiham le 8 Mai 1810.’\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Pierre Julian Jonneau, son of Jean Joseph Jonneau, de Daure, and of\r\nMarie Charlotte Franquiny de Feux, officer in the administration of the\r\nFrench Navy. Born in the Isle of Rhé. Died at Odiham, September 4th,\r\n1809, in the 29th year of his age.\r\n\r\n‘“He was a Prisoner of War. Death hath made him free.”’\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Communist trouble in France in 1871, quite a large number of\r\nFrench people came over to Odiham until order should be restored, and it\r\nwas during their stay here, but not by them, that the above-mentioned\r\ngraves were put in order. The old houses facing the Church and the\r\nstocks in Bury Close, and those by the large chalk-pit at the entrance\r\nto the town, remain much as when they were the lodgings of the prisoners\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Abergavenny, 281, 298, 363–4, 383, 393, 423.\r\n\r\n Admiralty, controlling exchange of prisoners, 26, 30;\r\n   responsible

When the officers at Wincanton were\r\n  marched to Gosport _en route_ for Scotland in 1812 they slept in the\r\n  church at Mere, Wiltshire, and the prisoners taken at Fishguard in\r\n  1797 were lodged in the church at Haverfordwest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  In addition to other sources of information, the foregoing notes on\r\n  the war-prisoners in Liverpool are taken from Picton’s _Memorials of\r\n  Liverpool_; the Histories of Muir and Barnes; Stonehouse’s\r\n  _Recollections of Old Liverpool_; Gomer Williams’s _Liverpool\r\n  Privateers_; and Richard Brooke’s _Liverpool from 1775 to 1800_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  I quote this between inverted commas, as I cannot help questioning its\r\n  accuracy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  In Glencorse churchyard is a cross upon which is engraved: ‘Ici repose\r\n  Charles Cotier de Dunquerque, mort 8 Janv., 1807.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Other authorities give the height of the outer wall as eight feet,\r\n  which was raised in 1812 to twelve feet, and of the inner wall as\r\n  twelve feet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  A recent visit to Kergilliack revealed nothing more than a large field\r\n  behind Kergilliack upper farm, bounded by an unusually massive wall,\r\n  and said to have been the prison exercising ground, and outside it a\r\n  tumulus locally reputed to mark the prison burial-place, and held to\r\n  be haunted.\r\n\r\n  An elaborately moulded plaster ceiling at Meudon Farm in Mawnan, five\r\n  miles from Kergilliack, is said to have been the work of foreign\r\n  prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  To account for this extraordinary, and apparently quite unnecessary\r\n  journey, during which Vanhille seems always to have had plenty of\r\n  money, M. Pariset thinks it possible that he was really an emissary of\r\n  the committee which was at this time earnestly considering the plan of\r\n  a general rising of all the prisoners of war in England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  I give this as in M. Pariset’s original. I have not been able to find\r\n  that Moore ever was thus employed. He made the offer at his trial, but\r\n  the Government declined it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  For much pertaining to Kelso, as for other matters associated with\r\n  prisoners of war on parole in Scotland, I have to thank Mr. J. John\r\n  Vernon, Hon. Secretary of the Hawick Archaeological Society.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  The above, and other Masonic notes which follow, are from the _History\r\n  of Freemasonry in the Province of Roxburgh, Peebles, and\r\n  Selkirkshire_, by Mr. W. Fred Vernon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  The rank of garde-marine in the French Navy corresponded with that of\r\n  sub-lieutenant in the British Navy; there was no rank actually\r\n  equivalent to our midshipmen.\r\n\r\n  The British midshipmen were sources of continued anxiety and annoyance\r\n  to their custodians in their French prisons. They defied all rules and\r\n  regulations, they refused to give their parole, and were ceaseless in\r\n  their attempts to escape. ‘I wish to goodness’, said a French officer\r\n  at Bitche one evening at dinner, ‘I knew what to do to keep those\r\n  English middies within bounds!’\r\n\r\n  ‘There is only one way, Sir,’ said a lady at the table.\r\n\r\n  ‘What is that?’ asked the officer eagerly.\r\n\r\n  ‘Put them on their honour,’ replied the lady.\r\n\r\n  General Courcelles, at Verdun, shut up 140 middies in the monastery at\r\n  St. Vannes, and made them pay for maintenance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  I failed to find a single grave-stone of a French prisoner of war at\r\n  Wincanton.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  For a letter from a former Leicester prisoner of this date, the reader\r\n  may be referred to p. 306.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
