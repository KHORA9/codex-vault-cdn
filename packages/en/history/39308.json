It is coming to a place new and yet most familiar, strange and\r\nyet so well known. When travellers arrive at Verona, for instance, or at\r\nArles, they generally go to the amphitheatres with a curiosity to know\r\nwhat they are like; but when they arrive at Rome and go to the Coliseum,\r\nit is to visit an object whose appearance has been familiar to them from\r\nchildhood, and, long ere it is reached, from the heights of the distant\r\nCapitol, they can recognize the well-known form;--and as regards St.\r\nPeter's, who is not familiar with the aspect of the dome, of the\r\nwide-spreading piazza, and the foaming fountains, for long years before\r\nthey come to gaze upon the reality?\r\n\r\n\"My presentiment of the emotions with which I should behold the Roman\r\nruins, has proved quite correct,\" wrote Niebuhr. \"Nothing about them is\r\nnew to me; as a child I lay so often, for hours together, before their\r\npictures, that their images were, even at that early age, as distinctly\r\nimpressed upon my mind, as if I had actually seen them.\"\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of the presence of old friends and landmarks, travellers\r\nwho pay a hurried visit to Rome, are bewildered by the vast mass of\r\ninterest before them, by the endless labyrinth of minor objects, which\r\nthey desire, or, still oftener, feel it a duty, to visit. Their Murray,\r\ntheir Baedeker, and their Bradshaw indicate appalling lists of churches,\r\ntemples, and villas which ought to be seen, but do not distribute them\r\nin a manner which will render their inspection more easy. The promised\r\npleasure seems rapidly to change into an endless vista of labour to be\r\nfulfilled and of fatigue to be gone through; henceforward the hours\r\nspent at Rome are rather hours of endurance than of pleasure--his\r\n_cicerone_ drags the traveller in one direction,--his antiquarian\r\nfriend, his artistic acquaintance, would fain drag him in others,--he is\r\nconfused by accumulated misty glimmerings from historical facts once\r\nlearnt at school, but long since forgotten,--of artistic information,\r\nwhich he feels that he ought to have gleaned from years of society, but\r\nwhich, from want of use, has never made any depth of impression,--by\r\nshadowy ideas as to the story of this king and that emperor, of this\r\npope and that saint, which, from insufficient time, and the absence of\r\nbooks of reference, he has no opportunity of clearing up. It is\r\ntherefore in the hope of aiding some of these bewildered ones, and of\r\nrendering their walks in Rome more easy and more interesting, that the\r\nfollowing chapters are written. They aim at nothing original, and are\r\nonly a gathering up of the information of others, and a gleaning from\r\nwhat has been already given to the world in a far better and fuller, but\r\nless portable form; while, in their plan, they attempt to guide the\r\ntraveller in his daily wanderings through the city and its suburbs.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed, that one short residence at Rome will\r\nbe sufficient to make a foreigner acquainted with all its varied\r\ntreasures; or even, in most cases, that its attractions will become\r\napparent to the passing stranger. The squalid appearance of its modern\r\nstreets, the filth of its beggars, the inconveniences of its daily life,\r\nwill leave an impression which will go far to neutralize the effect of\r\nits ancient buildings, and the grandeur of its historic recollections.\r\nIt is only by returning again and again, by allowing the _feeling_ of\r\nRome to gain upon you, when you have constantly revisited the same view,\r\nthe same temple, the same picture, that Rome engraves itself upon your\r\nheart, and changes from a disagreeable, unwholesome acquaintance, into a\r\ndear and intimate friend, seldom long absent from your thoughts.\r\n\"Whoever,\" said Chateaubriand, \"has nothing else left in life, should\r\ncome to live in Rome; there he will find for society a land which will\r\nnourish his reflections, walks which will always tell him something new.\r\nThe stone which crumbles under his feet will speak to him, and even the\r\ndust which the wind raises under his footsteps will seem to bear with it\r\nsomething of human grandeur.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we have once known Rome,\" wrote Hawthorne, \"and left her where she\r\nlies, like a long-decaying corpse, retaining a trace of the noble shape\r\nit was, but with accumulated dust and a fungous growth overspreading all\r\nits more admirable features--left her in utter weariness, no doubt, of\r\nher narrow, crooked, intricate streets, so uncomfortably paved with\r\nlittle squares of lava that to tread over them is a penitential\r\npilgrimage; so indescribably ugly, moreover, so cold, so alley-like,\r\ninto which the sun never falls, and where a chill wind forces its deadly\r\nbreath into our lungs--left her, tired of the sight of those immense\r\nseven-storied, yellow-washed hovels, or call them palaces, where all\r\nthat is dreary in domestic life seems magnified and multiplied, and\r\nweary of climbing those staircases which ascend from a ground-floor of\r\ncook-shops, cobblers'-stalls, stables, and regiments of cavalry, to a\r\nmiddle region of princes, cardinals, and ambassadors, and an upper tier\r\nof artists, just beneath the unattainable sky,--left her, worn out with\r\nshivering at the cheerless and smoky fireside by day, and feasting with\r\nour own substance the ravenous population of a Roman bed at night, left\r\nher sick at heart of Italian trickery, which has uprooted whatever faith\r\nin man's integrity had endured till now, and sick at stomach of sour\r\nbread, sour wine, rancid butter, and bad cookery, needlessly bestowed on\r\nevil meats,--left her, disgusted with the pretence of holiness and the\r\nreality of nastiness, each equally omnipresent,--left her, half lifeless\r\nfrom the languid atmosphere, the vital principle of which has been used\r\nup long ago or corrupted by myriads of slaughters,--left her, crushed\r\ndown in spirit by the desolation of her ruin, and the hopelessness of\r\nher future,--left her, in short, hating her with all our might, and\r\nadding our individual curse to the infinite anathema which her old\r\ncrimes have unmistakeably brought down:--when we have left Rome in such\r\nmood as this, we are astonished by the discovery, by-and-by, that our\r\nheartstrings have mysteriously attached themselves to the Eternal City,\r\nand are drawing us thitherward again, as if it were more familiar, more\r\nintimately our home, than even the spot where we were born.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the attractive and sympathetic power of Rome which Byron so\r\nfully appreciated--\r\n\r\n      \"Oh Rome my country! city of the soul!\r\n      The orphans of the heart must turn to thee,\r\n      Lone mother of dead empires! and controul\r\n      In their shut breasts their petty misery.\r\n      What are our woes and sufferance? Come and see\r\n      The cypress, hear the owl, and plod your way\r\n      O'er steps of broken thrones and temples. Ye!\r\n      Whose agonies are evils of a day--\r\n    A world is at our feet as fragile as our clay.\r\n\r\n      \"The Niobe of nations! there she stands\r\n      Childless and crownless, in her voiceless woe;\r\n      An empty urn within her withered hands,\r\n      Whose sacred dust was scattered long ago;\r\n      The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;\r\n      The very sepulchres lie tenantless\r\n      Of their heroic dwellers: dost thou flow,\r\n      Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?\r\n    Rise, with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress!\"\r\n\r\nThe impressiveness of an arrival at the Eternal City was formerly\r\nenhanced by the solemn singularity of the country through which it was\r\nslowly approached. \"Those who arrive at Rome now by the railway,\" says\r\nMrs. Craven in her 'Anne Severin,' \"and rush like a whirlwind into a\r\nstation, which has nothing in its first aspect to distinguish it from\r\nthat of one of the most obscure places in the world, cannot imagine the\r\neffect which the words 'Ecco Roma' formerly produced, when on arriving\r\nat the point in the road from which the Eternal City could be descried\r\nfor the first time, the postillion stopped his horses, and pointing it\r\nout to the traveller in the distance, pronounced them with that Roman\r\naccent which is grave and sonorous, as the name of Rome itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How pleasing,\" says Cardinal Wiseman, \"was the usual indication to\r\nearly travellers, by voice and outstretched whip, embodied in the\r\nwell-known exclamation of every vetturino, 'Ecco Roma.' To one 'lasso\r\nmaris et viarum,' like Horace, these words brought the first promise of\r\napproaching rest. A few more miles of weary hills, every one of which,\r\nfrom its summit, gave a more swelling and majestic outline to what so\r\nfar constituted 'Roma,' that is, the great cupola, not of the church,\r\nbut of the city, its only discernible part, cutting, like a huge peak,\r\ninto the dear winter sky, and the long journey was ended, and ended by\r\nthe full realization of well-cherished hopes.\"\r\n\r\nMost travellers, perhaps, in the old days came by sea from Marseilles\r\nand arrived from Civita Vecchia, by the dreary road which leads through\r\nPalo, and near the base of the hills upon which stands Cervetri, the\r\nancient Cære, from the junction of whose name and customs the word\r\n\"ceremony\" has arisen,--so especially useful in the great neighbouring\r\ncity. \"This road from Civita Vecchia,\" writes Miss Edwards, the talented\r\nauthoress of 'Barbara's History,' \"lies among shapeless hillocks, shaggy\r\nwith bush and briar. Far away on one side gleams a line of soft blue\r\nsea--on the other lie mountains as blue, but not more distant. Not a\r\nsound stirs the stagnant air. Not a tree, not a housetop, breaks the\r\nwide monotony. The dust lies beneath the wheels like a carpet, and\r\nfollows like a cloud. The grass is yellow, the weeds are parched; and\r\nwhere there have been wayside pools, the ground is cracked and dry. Now\r\nwe pass a crumbling fragment of something that may have been a tomb or\r\ntemple, centuries ago. Now we come upon a little wide-eyed peasant boy,\r\nkeeping goats among the ruins, like Giotto of old. Presently a buffalo\r\nlifts his black mane above the neighbouring hillock, and rushes away\r\nbefore we can do more than point to the spot on which we saw it. Thus\r\nthe day attains its noon, and the sun hangs overhead like a brazen\r\nshield, brilliant, but cold. Thus, too, we reach the brow of a long and\r\nsteep ascent, where our driver pulls up to rest his weary beasts. The\r\nsea has now faded almost out of sight; the mountains look larger and\r\nnearer, with streaks of snow upon their summits, the Campagna reaches on\r\nand on and shows no sign of limit or of verdure,--while, in the midst of\r\nthe clear air, half way, so it would seem, between you and the purple\r\nSabine range, rises one solemn solitary dome. Can it be the dome of St.\r\nPeter's?\"\r\n\r\nThe great feature of the Civita Vecchia route was that after all the\r\nutter desolation and dreariness of many miles of the least interesting\r\npart of the Campagna, the traveller was almost stunned by the\r\ntransition, when on suddenly passing the Porta Cavalleggieri, he found\r\nhimself in the Piazza, of St. Peter's, with its wide-spreading\r\ncolonnades, and high-springing fountains; indeed the first building he\r\nsaw was St. Peter's, the first house that of the Pope, the palace of the\r\nVatican. But the more gradual approach by land from Viterbo and Tuscany\r\npossessed equal if not superior interest.\r\n\r\n\"When we turned the summit above Viterbo,\" wrote Dr. Arnold, \"and opened\r\non the view on the other side, it might be called the first approach to\r\nRome. At the distance of more than forty miles, it was of course\r\nimpossible to see the town, and besides the distance was hazy; but we\r\nwere looking on the scene of the Roman history; we were standing on the\r\noutward edge of the frame of the great picture, and though the features\r\nof it were not to be traced distinctly, yet we had the consciousness\r\nthat they were before us. Here, too, we first saw the Mediterranean, the\r\nAlban hills, I think, in the remote distance, and just beneath us, on\r\nthe left, Soracte, an outlier of the Apennines, which has got to the\r\nright bank of the Tiber, and stands out by itself most magnificently.\r\nClose under us in front, was the Ciminian lake, the crater of an extinct\r\nvolcano, surrounded as they all are, with their basin of wooded hills,\r\nand lying like a beautiful mirror stretched out before us. Then there\r\nwas the grand beauty of Italian scenery, the depth of the valleys, the\r\nendless variety of the mountain outline, and the towns perched upon the\r\nmountain summits, and this now seen under a mottled sky, which threw an\r\never-varying light and shadow over the valley beneath, and all the\r\nfreshness of the young spring. We descended along one of the rims of\r\nthis lake to Ronciglione, and from thence, still descending on the\r\nwhole, to Monterosi. Here the famous Campagna begins, and it certainly\r\nis one of the most striking tracts of country I ever beheld. It is by no\r\nmeans a perfect flat, except between Rome and the sea; but rather like\r\nthe Bagshot Heath country, ridges of hills with intermediate valleys,\r\nand the road often running between high steep banks, and sometimes\r\ncrossing sluggish streams sunk in a deep bed. All these banks are\r\novergrown with broom, now in full flower; and the same plant was\r\nluxuriant everywhere. There seemed no apparent reason why the country\r\nshould be so desolate; the grass was growing richly everywhere. There\r\nwas no marsh anywhere visible, but all looked as fresh and healthy as\r\nany of our chalk downs in England. But it is a wide wilderness; no\r\nvillages, scarcely any houses, and here and there a lonely ruin of a\r\nsingle square tower, which I suppose used to serve as strongholds for\r\nmen and cattle in the plundering warfare in the middle ages. It was\r\nafter crowning the top of one of these lines of hills, a little on the\r\nRoman side of Baccano, at five minutes after six, according to my watch,\r\nthat we had the first view of Rome itself. I expected to see St. Peter's\r\nrising above the line of the horizon, as York Minster does, but instead\r\nof that, it was within the horizon, and so was much less conspicuous,\r\nand from the nature of the ground, it looked mean and stumpy. Nothing\r\nelse marked the site of the city, but the trees of the gardens and a\r\nnumber of white villas specking the opposite bank of the Tiber for some\r\nlittle distance above the town, and then suddenly ceasing. But the whole\r\nscene that burst upon our view, when taken in all its parts, was most\r\ninteresting. Full in front rose the Alban hills, the white villas on\r\ntheir sides distinctly visible, even at that distance, which was more\r\nthan thirty miles. On the left were the Apennines, and Tivoli was\r\ndistinctly to be seen on the summit of its mountain, on one of the\r\nlowest and nearest parts of the chain. On the right and all before us\r\nlay the Campagna, whose perfectly level outline was succeeded by that of\r\nthe sea, which was scarcely more so. It began now to get dark, and as\r\nthere is hardly any twilight, it was dark soon after we left La Storta,\r\nthe last post before you enter Rome. The air blew fresh and cool, and we\r\nhad a pleasant drive over the remaining part of the Campagna, till we\r\ndescended into the valley of the Tiber, and crossed it by the Milvian\r\nbridge. About two miles further on we reached the walls of Rome, and\r\nentered it by the Porta del Popolo.\"\r\n\r\nNiebuhr coming the same way says:--\"It was with solemn feelings that\r\nthis morning from the barren heights of the moory Campagna, I first\r\ncaught sight of the cupola of St. Peter's, and then of the city from the\r\nbridge, where all the majesty of her buildings and her history seems to\r\nlie spread out before the eye of the stranger; and afterwards entered by\r\nthe Porta del Popolo.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël gives us the impression which the same subject would\r\nproduce on a different type of character:--\r\n\r\n\"Le comte d'Erfeuil faisait de comiques lamentations sur les environs de\r\nRome. Quoi, disait-il, point de maison de campagne, point de voiture,\r\nrien qui annonce le voisinage d'une grande ville! Ah! bon Dieu, quelle\r\ntristesse! En approchant de Rome, les postillons s'écrièrent avec\r\ntransport: _Voyez, voyez, c'est la coupole de Saint-Pierre!_ Les\r\nNapolitains montrent aussi le Vésuve; et la mer fait de même l'orgueil\r\ndes habitans des côtes. On croirait voir le dôme des Invalides, s'écria\r\nle comte d'Erfeuil.\"\r\n\r\nIt was by this approach that most of its distinguished pilgrims have\r\nentered the capital of the Catholic world: monks, who came hither to\r\nobtain the foundation of their Orders; saints, who thirsted to worship\r\nat the shrines of their predecessors, or who came to receive the crown\r\nof martyrdom; priests and bishops from distant lands,--many coming in\r\nturn to receive here the highest dignity which Christendom could offer;\r\nkings and emperors, to ask coronation at the hands of the reigning\r\npontiff; and among all these, came by this road, in the full fervour of\r\nCatholic enthusiasm, Martin Luther, the future enemy of Rome, then its\r\ndevoted adherent. \"When Luther came to Rome,\" says Ampère, in his\r\n'Portraits de Rome à Divers Ages,' \"the future reformer was a young\r\nmonk, obscure and fervent; he had no presentiment, when he set foot in\r\nthe great Babylon, that ten years later he would burn the bull of the\r\nPope in the public square of Wittenberg. His heart experienced nothing\r\nbut pious emotions; he addressed to Rome in salutation the ancient hymn\r\nof the pilgrims; he cried, 'I salute thee, O holy Rome, Rome venerable\r\nthrough the blood and the tombs of the martyrs.' But after having\r\nprostrated on the threshold, he raised himself, he entered into the\r\ntemple, he did not find the God he looked for; the city of the saints\r\nand martyrs was a city of murderers and prostitutes. The arts which\r\nmarked this corruption were powerless over the stolid senses, and\r\nscandalised the austere spirit of the German monk; he scarcely gave a\r\npassing glance at the ruins of pagan Rome;--and inwardly horrified by\r\nall that he saw, he quitted Rome in a frame of mind very different from\r\nthat which he brought with him; he knelt then with the devotion of the\r\npilgrims, now he returned in a disposition like that of the _frondeurs_\r\nof the Middle Ages, but more serious than theirs. This Rome of which he\r\nhad been the dupe, and concerning which he was disabused, should hear of\r\nhim again; the day would come when, amid the merry toasts at his table,\r\nhe would cry three times, 'I would not have missed going to Rome for a\r\nthousand florins, for I should always have been uneasy lest I should\r\nhave been rendering injustice to the Pope.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen one is in Rome life seems to be free from many of the petty\r\ntroubles which beset it in other places; there is no foreign town which\r\noffers so many comforts and advantages to its English visitors. The\r\nhotels, indeed, are enormously expensive, and the rent of apartments is\r\nhigh; but when the latter is once paid, living is rather cheap than\r\notherwise, especially for those who do not object to dine from a\r\n_trattoria_, and to drive in hackney carriages.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Rome is very variable. If the _sirocco_ blows, it is mild\r\nand very relaxing; but the winters are more apt to be subject to the\r\nsevere cold of the _tramontana_, which requires even greater precaution\r\nand care than that of an English winter. Nothing can be more mistaken\r\nthan the impression that those who go to Italy are sure to find there a\r\nmild and congenial temperature. The climate of Rome has been subject to\r\nseverity, even from the earliest times of its history. Dionysius speaks\r\nof one year in the time of the republic when the snow at Rome lay seven\r\nfeet deep, and many men and cattle died of the cold.[1] Another year,\r\nthe snow lay for forty days, trees perished, and cattle died of\r\nhunger.[2] Present times are a great improvement on these: snow seldom\r\nlies upon the ground for many hours together, and the beautiful\r\nfountains of the city are only hung with icicles long enough to allow\r\nthe photographers to represent them thus; but still the climate is not\r\nto be trifled with, and violent transitions from the hot sunshine to the\r\ncold shade of the streets often prove fatal. \"No one but dogs and\r\nEnglishmen,\" say the Romans, \"ever walk in the sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe _malaria_, which is so much dreaded by the natives, lies dormant\r\nduring the winter months, and seldom affects strangers, unless they are\r\ninordinately imprudent in sitting out in the sunset. With the heats of\r\nthe late summer this insidious ague-fever is apt to follow on the\r\nslightest exertion, and particularly to overwhelm those who are employed\r\nin field labour. From June to November the Villa Borghese and the Villa\r\nDoria are uninhabitable, and the more deserted hills--the Cœlian, the\r\nAventine, and the greater part of the Esquiline,--are a constant prey to\r\nfever. The malaria, however, flies before a crowd of human life, and the\r\nGhetto, which teems with inhabitants, is perfectly free from it. In the\r\nCampagna,--with the exception of Porto d'Anzio, which has always been\r\nhealthy,--no town or village is safe after the month of August, and to\r\nthis cause the utter desolation of so many formerly populous sites\r\n(especially those of Veii and Galera) may be attributed:--\r\n\r\n    \"Roma, vorax hominum, domat ardua colla virorum;\r\n    Roma, ferax febrium, necis est uberrima frugum:\r\n    Romanæ febres stabili sunt jure fideles.\"\r\n\r\nThus wrote Peter Damian in the 10th century, and those who refuse to be\r\non their guard will find it so still.\r\n\r\nThe greatest risk at Rome is incurred by those who, coming out of the\r\nhot sunshine, spend long hours in the Vatican and the other galleries,\r\nwhich are filled with a deadly chill during the winter months. As March\r\ncomes on this chill wears away, and in April and May the temperature of\r\nthe galleries is delightful, and it is impossible to find a more\r\nagreeable retreat. It is in the hope of inducing strangers to spend more\r\ntime in the study of these wonderful museums, and of giving additional\r\ninterest to the hours which are passed there, that so much is said about\r\ntheir contents in these volumes. As far as possible it has been desired\r\nto evade any mere catalogue of their collections,--so that no mention\r\nhas been made of objects which possess inferior artistic or historical\r\ninterest; while by introducing anecdotes connected with those to which\r\nattention is drawn, or by quoting the opinion of some good authority\r\nconcerning them, an endeavour has been made to fix them in the\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nSo much has been written about Rome, that in quoting from the remarks of\r\nothers the great difficulty has been selection,--and the rule has been\r\nfollowed that the most learned books are not always the most instructive\r\nor the most interesting. No endeavour has been made to enter into deep\r\narchæological questions,--to define the exact limits of the Walls of\r\nServius Tullius,--or to hazard a fresh opinion as to how the earth\r\naccumulated in the Roman Forum, or whence the pottery came, out of which\r\nthe Monte Testaccio has arisen; but it has rather been sought to gather\r\nup and present to the reader such a succession of word pictures from\r\nvarious authors, as may not only make the scenes of Rome more\r\ninteresting at the time, but may deepen their impression afterwards.\r\nThis was the work which the late illustrious M. Ampère intended to carry\r\nout, and which he would have done so much better and more fully.\r\n\r\nFrom the experience of many years the writer can truly say that the more\r\nintimately these scenes become known, the more deeply they become\r\nengraven upon the inmost affections. Rome, as Goethe truly says, \"is a\r\nworld, and it takes years to find oneself at home in it.\" It is not a\r\nhurried visit to the Coliseum, with guide book and cicerone, which will\r\nenable one to drink in the fulness of its beauty; but a long and\r\nfamiliar friendship with its solemn walls, in the ever-varying grandeur\r\nof golden sunlight and grey shadow--till, after many days'\r\ncompanionship, its stones become dear as those of no other building ever\r\ncan be;--and it is not a rapid inspection of the huge cheerless\r\nbasilicas and churches, with their gaudy marbles and gilded ceilings and\r\nill-suited monuments, which arouses your sympathy; but the long\r\ninvestigation of their precious fragments of ancient cloister, and\r\nsculptured fountain,--of mouldering fresco, and mediæval tomb,--of\r\nmosaic-crowned gateway, and palm-shadowed garden;--and the\r\ngradually-acquired knowledge of the wondrous story which clings around\r\neach of these ancient things, and which tells how each has a motive and\r\nmeaning entirely unsuspected and unseen by the passing eye.\r\n\r\nThe immense extent of Rome, and the wide distances to be traversed\r\nbetween its different ruins and churches, is in itself a sufficient\r\nreason for devoting more time to it than to the other cities of Italy.\r\nSurprise will doubtless be felt that so few pagan ruins remain,\r\nconsidering the enormous number which are known to have existed even\r\ndown to a comparatively late period. A monumental record of A.D. 540,\r\npublished by Cardinal Mai, mentions 324 streets, 2 capitols--the\r\nTarpeian and that on the Quirinal,--80 gilt statues of the gods (only\r\nthe Hercules remains), 66 ivory statues of the gods, 46,608 houses,\r\n17,097 palaces, 13,052 fountains, 3785 statues of emperors and generals\r\nin bronze, 22 great equestrian statues of bronze (only Marcus Aurelius\r\nremains), 2 colossi (Marcus Aurelius and Trajan), 9026 baths, 31\r\ntheatres, and 8 amphitheatres!\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to speak too highly of the facilities afforded to\r\nstrangers for seeing and enjoying everything, especially by the Roman\r\nnobility. The beautiful grounds of the Villa Borghese and the Villa\r\nDoria appear to be kept up at an enormous expense, solely for the use\r\nand pleasure of the public, and almost all the palaces and collections\r\nare thrown open on fixed days with unequalled liberality. In almost all\r\nthese galleries, museums, and gardens the stranger is permitted to\r\nwander about and linger as he pleases, entirely unmolested by officious\r\nservants and ignorant _ciceroni_.\r\n\r\nThose will enjoy Rome most who have studied it thoroughly before leaving\r\ntheir own homes. In the multiplicity of engagements in which a foreigner\r\nis soon involved, there is little time for historical research, and few\r\nare able to do more than \"read up their Murray,\" so that half the\r\npleasure and all the advantage of a visit to Rome are thrown away: while\r\nthose who arrive with the foundation already prepared, easily and\r\nnaturally acquire, amid the scenes around which the history of the world\r\nrevolved, an amount of information which will be astonishing even to\r\nthemselves. \"People out of Rome,\" says Goethe, \"have no idea how one is\r\n_schooled_ there;\" but then, as the author of 'Vera' remarks, \"that is\r\ntrue of Rome, which Madame Swetchine said of life, viz. that you find\r\nexactly what you put into it.\"\r\n\r\nThe pagan monuments of Rome have been written of and discussed ever\r\nsince they were built, and the catacombs have lately found historians\r\nand guides both able and willing,--about the later Christian monuments\r\nfar less has hitherto been said. In English, except in the immense\r\ncollection of interest which is imbedded in the works of Hemans, and in\r\nthe few beautiful notices of some of the early martyrs by Mrs. Jameson,\r\nvery little has been written; in French there is far more. There is a\r\nnatural shrinking in the English Protestant mind from all that is\r\nconnected with the story of the saints,--especially the later saints of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church. Many believe, with Addison, \"that the\r\nChristian antiquities are so embroiled in fable and legend, that one\r\nderives but little satisfaction from searching into them.\" And yet, as\r\nMrs. Jameson observes, when all that the controversialist can desire is\r\ntaken away from the reminiscences of those, who to the Roman Catholic\r\nmind have consecrated the homes of their earthly life, how much\r\nremains!--\"so much to awaken, to elevate, to touch the heart;--so much\r\nthat will not fade from the memory, so much that may make a part of our\r\nafter-life.\"\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made in these pages to describe the country round\r\nRome, beyond a few of the most ordinary drives and excursions outside\r\nthe walls. The opening of the railways to Naples and Civita Vecchia have\r\nnow brought a vast variety of new excursions within the range of a\r\nday's expedition--and the papal citadel of Anagni, the temples of Cori,\r\nthe cyclopean remains of Segni, Alatri, Norba, Cervetri, and Corneto,\r\nand the wild heights of Soracte, will probably ere long become as well\r\nknown as the oft-visited Tivoli, Ostia, and Albano. It is intended to\r\nsupplement these \"Walks in Rome\" by a similar volume of \"Excursions\r\nround Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDULL-USEFUL INFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Hotels._--For passing travellers or bachelors, the best are: Hotel\r\n     d'Angleterre, Bocca di Leone; Hotel de Rome, Corso. For families,\r\n     or for a long residence: Hotel des Iles Britanniques, Piazza del\r\n     Popolo; Hotel de Russie (close to the last), Via Babuino; Hotel de\r\n     Londres, and Hotel Europa, Piazza di Spagna; Hotel Costanzi, Via S.\r\n     Nicolo in Tolentino, in a high airy situation towards the\r\n     railway-station, and very comfortable and well managed, but further\r\n     from the sights of Rome. Less expensive, are: Hotel d'Allemagne,\r\n     Via Condotti; Hotel Vittoria, Via Due Macelli; Hotel d'Italie, Via\r\n     Quattro Fontane; Hotel della Pace, 8 Via Felice; Hotel Minerva,\r\n     Piazza della Minerva, very near the Pantheon. A large new hotel is\r\n     the \"Quirinale,\" in the Via Nazionale.\r\n\r\n     _Pensions_ are much wanted in Rome. The best are those of Miss\r\n     Smith and Madame Tellenbach, in the Piazza di Spagna; Pension Suez,\r\n     Via S. Nicolo in Tolentino; and the small Hotel du Sud, in the Capo\r\n     le Case.\r\n\r\n     _Apartments_ have lately greatly increased in price. An apartment\r\n     for a very small family in one of the best situations can seldom be\r\n     obtained for less than 300 to 500 francs a month. The English\r\n     almost all prefer to reside in the neighbourhood of the Piazza di\r\n     Spagna. The best situations are the sunny side of the Piazza\r\n     itself, the Trinità de' Monti, the Via Gregoriana, and Via Sistina.\r\n     Less good situations are, the Corso, Via Condotti, Via Due Macelli,\r\n     Via Frattina, Capo le Case, Via Felice, Via Quattro Fontane, Via\r\n     Babuino, and Via delle Croce,--in which last, however, are many\r\n     very good apartments. On the other side of the Corso suites of\r\n     rooms are much less expensive, but they are less convenient for\r\n     persons who make a short residence in Rome. In many of the palaces\r\n     are large apartments which are let by the year.\r\n\r\n     _Trattorie_ (Restaurants) send out dinners to families in\r\n     apartments in a tin box with a stove, for which the bearer calls\r\n     the next morning. A dinner for six francs ought to be amply\r\n     sufficient for three persons, and to leave enough for luncheon the\r\n     next day. _Restaurants_ where luncheons or dinners may be obtained\r\n     upon the spot, are those of Bedeau, Via della Croce, and Nazzari,\r\n     Piazza di Spagna. Those who wish for a real Roman dinner of\r\n     Porcupine, Hedgehog, and other such delicacies, find it at the\r\n     Falcone, where Ariosto used to lodge when in Rome.\r\n\r\n     _English Church._--Just outside the Porta del Popolo, on the left.\r\n     Services at 9 A.M., 11 A.M., and 3 P.M. on Sundays; daily service\r\n     twice on week-days.

The English mail leaves\r\n     daily at 8 P.M.\r\n\r\n     _Telegraph Office._--121 Piazza Monte-Citorio.

Perhaps the\r\nmost important objects are:\r\n\r\n     _Churches._--S. Peter's, S. John Lateran, Sta. Maria Maggiore, S.\r\n     Lorenzo fuori Mura, S. Paoli fuori Mura, S. Agnese fuori Mura, Ara\r\n     Cœli, S. Clemente, S. Pietro in Montorio, S. Pietro in Vincoli,\r\n     Sta. Sabina, Sta. Prassede and Sta. Pudentiana, S. Gregorio, S.\r\n     Stefano Rotondo, Sta. Maria sopra Minerva, Sta. Maria del Popolo.\r\n\r\n     _Palaces._--Vatican, Capitol, Borghese, Barberini (and, if\r\n     possible, Corsini, Colonna, Sciarra, Rospigliosi, and Spada).\r\n\r\n     _Villas._--Albani, Doria, Borghese, Wolkonski, and, though less\r\n     important, Ludovisi.\r\n\r\n     _Ruins._--Palace of the Cæsars, Temples in Forum, Coliseum, and, if\r\n     possible, the ruins in the Ghetto, and the Baths of Caracalla.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable for the traveller who is pressed for time to apply at\r\nonce to his Banker for orders for any of the villas for which they are\r\nnecessary. The following scheme will give a good general idea of Rome\r\nand its neighbourhood in a few days. The sights printed in italics can\r\nonly be seen on the days to which they are ascribed:--\r\n\r\n     _Monday._--General view of Capitol, Gallery of Sculpture, Ara\r\n     Cœli, General view of Forum, Coliseum, St. John Lateran (with\r\n     cloisters), and drive out to the Via Latina and the aqueducts at\r\n     Tavolato.\r\n\r\n     _Tuesday._--Morning: St. Peter's and the Vatican Stanze. Afternoon:\r\n     _Villa Albani_, St. Agnese, and drive to the Ponte Nomentana.\r\n\r\n     _Wednesday._--Go to Tivoli (the Cascades, Cascatelle, and Villa\r\n     d'Este).\r\n\r\n     _Thursday._--Morning: _Palace of the Cæsars._ Afternoon: drive on\r\n     the Via Appia as far as Torre Mezzo Strada; in returning, see the\r\n     Baths of Caracalla.\r\n\r\n     _Friday._--Morning: Palazzo Borghese, Palazzo Spada, The Ghetto,\r\n     The Temple of Vesta, cross the Ponte Rotto to Sta. Cecilia; and end\r\n     in the afternoon at St. Pietro in Montorio and the _Villa Doria_\r\n     (or on Monday).\r\n\r\n     _Saturday._--Frascati and Albano. Drive to Frascati early, take\r\n     donkeys, by Rocca di Papa to Mte. Cavo; take luncheon at the\r\n     Temple, and return by Palazzuolo and the upper and lower Galleries\r\n     to Albano, whither the carriage should be sent on to await you at\r\n     the Hotel de Russie. Drive back to Rome in the evening.\r\n\r\n     _Sunday._--Morning: Sta. Maria del Popolo on way to English Church.\r\n     Afternoon: St. Peter's again; drive to Monte Mario (Villa Mellini),\r\n     or in the Villa Borghese, and end with the Pincio.\r\n\r\n     _2d Monday._--Morning: Sta. Prassede, Sta. Pudentiana, Sta. Maria\r\n     Maggiore. Afternoon: Sta. Sabina, Priorato Garden, English\r\n     Cemetery, S. Paolo, and the Tre Fontane.\r\n\r\n     _2d Tuesday._--Morning: Vatican Sculptures. Afternoon: S. Gregorio,\r\n     S. Stefano Rotondo, S. Clemente, S. Pietro in Vincoli, Sta. Maria\r\n     degli Angeli, S. Lorenzo fuori Mura, and drive out to the Torre dei\r\n     Schiavi, returning by the Porta Maggiore.\r\n\r\n     _2d Wednesday._--Morning: Palazzo Barberini, _Palazzo Rospigliosi_,\r\n     (and on Saturdays) Vatican Pictures. Afternoon: Forum in detail,\r\n     SS. Cosmo and Damian, and ascend the Coliseum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following list may be useful as a guide to some of the best subjects\r\nfor artists who wish to draw at Rome, and have not much time to search\r\nfor themselves:--\r\n\r\n_Morning Light_:\r\n\r\n    Temple of Vesta with the fountain.\r\n    Arch of Constantine from the Coliseum (early).\r\n    Coliseum from behind Sta. Francesca Romana (early).\r\n    Temples in the Forum from the School of Xanthus.\r\n    View from the Garden of the Rupe Tarpeia.\r\n    In the Garden of S. Giovanni e Paolo.\r\n    In the Garden of S. Buonaventura.\r\n    In the Garden of the S. Bartolomeo in Isola.\r\n    In the Garden of S. Onofrio.\r\n    On the Tiber from Poussin's Walk.\r\n    From the door of the Villa Medici.\r\n    At S. Cosimato.\r\n    At the back entrance of Ara Cœli.\r\n    At the Portico of Octavia.\r\n    Looking to the Arch of Titus up the Via Sacra.\r\n    In the Cloister of the Lateran.\r\n    In the Cloister of the Certosa.\r\n    Near the Temple of Bacchus.\r\n    On the Via Appia, beyond Cecilia Metella.\r\n    Torre Mezza Strada on the Via Appia.\r\n    Torre Nomentana, looking to the mountains.\r\n    Ponte Nomentana, looking to the Mons Sacer.\r\n    Torre dei Schiavi, looking towards Tivoli.\r\n    Aqueducts at Tavolato.\r\n\r\n_Evening Light_:\r\n\r\n    From St. John Lateran.\r\n    From the Ponte Rotto.\r\n    From the Terrace of the Villa Doria (St. Peter's).\r\n    Palace of the Cæsars--Roman side--looking to Sta. Balbina.\r\n    Palace of the Cæsars--French side--looking to the Coliseum.\r\n    Apse of S. Giovanni e Paolo.\r\n    Near the Navicella.\r\n    Garden of the Villa Mattei.\r\n    Garden of the Villa Wolkonski.\r\n    Garden of the Priorato.\r\n    Porta S. Lorenzo.\r\n    Torre dei Schiavi, looking towards Rome.\r\n    Via Latina, looking towards the Aqueducts.\r\n    Via Latina, looking towards Rome.\r\n\r\nThe months of November and December are the best for drawing. The\r\ncolouring is then magnificent; it is enhanced by the tints of the\r\ndecaying vegetation, and the shadows are strong and clear. January is\r\ngenerally cold for sitting out, and February wet; and before the end of\r\nMarch the vegetation is often so far advanced that the Alban Hills,\r\nwhich have retained glorious sapphire and amethyst tints all winter,\r\nchange into commonplace green English downs; while the Campagna, from\r\nthe crimson and gold of its dying thistles and fenochii, becomes a\r\nlovely green plain waving with flowers.\r\n\r\nForeigners are much too apt to follow the native custom of driving\r\nconstantly in the Villa Borghese, the Villa Doria, and on the Pincio,\r\nand getting out to walk there during their drives. For those who do not\r\ncare always to see the human world, a delightful variety of drives can\r\nbe found; and it is a most agreeable plan for invalids, without\r\ncarriages of their own, to take a \"course to the Parco di San Gregorio,\"\r\nor to the sunny avenues near the Lateran, and walk there instead of on\r\nthe Pincio. A carriage for the return may almost always be found in the\r\nForum or at the Lateran.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CORSO AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD.\r\n\r\n     The Piazza del Popolo--Obelisk--Sta.

The scene is one well known from pictures and\r\nengravings. The space between the streets is occupied by twin churches,\r\nerected by Cardinal Gastaldi.\r\n\r\n     \"Les deux églises élevées au Place du Peuple par le Cardinal\r\n     Gastaldi à l'entrée du Corso, sont d'un effet médiocre. Comment un\r\n     cardinal n'a-t-il pas senti qu'il ne faut pas élever une église\r\n     pour _faire pendant_ à quelque chose? C'est ravaler la majesté\r\n     divine.\" _Stendhal_, i. 172.\r\n\r\nIt is in the church on the left that sermons are preached every winter\r\non Sunday afternoons by some of the best Roman Catholic\r\ncontroversialists, just at the right moment for catching the Protestant\r\ncongregations as they emerge from their chapels outside the Porta del\r\nPopolo.\r\n\r\nThese churches are believed to occupy the site of the magnificent tomb\r\nof Sylla, who died at Puteoli B.C. 82, but was honoured at Rome with a\r\npublic funeral, at which the patrician ladies burnt masses of incense\r\nand perfumes on his funeral pyre.\r\n\r\nThe _Obelisk_ of the Piazza del Popolo was placed on this site by Sixtus\r\nV. in 1589, but was originally brought to Rome and erected in honour of\r\nApollo by the Emperor Augustus.\r\n\r\n     \"Apollo was the patron of the spot which had given a name to the\r\n     great victory of Actium; Apollo himself, it was proclaimed, had\r\n     fought for Rome and for Octavius on that auspicious day; the same\r\n     Apollo, the Sun-god, had shuddered in his bright career at the\r\n     murder of the Dictator, and terrified the nations by the eclipse of\r\n     his divine countenance.\" ... Therefore, \"besides building a temple\r\n     to Apollo on the Palatine hill, the Emperor Augustus sought to\r\n     honour him by transplanting to the Circus Maximus, the sports of\r\n     which were under his special protection, an obelisk from\r\n     Heliopolis, in Egypt. This flame-shaped column was a symbol of the\r\n     sun, and originally bore a blazing orb upon its summit. It is\r\n     interesting to trace an intelligible motive for the first\r\n     introduction into Europe of these grotesque and unsightly monuments\r\n     of eastern superstition.\"--_Merivale, Hist. of the Romans._\r\n\r\n     \"This red granite obelisk, oldest of things, even in Rome, rises in\r\n     the centre of the piazza, with a four-fold fountain at its base.\r\n     All Roman works and ruins (whether of the empire, the far-off\r\n     republic, or the still more distant kings) assume a transient,\r\n     visionary, and impalpable character, when we think that this\r\n     indestructible monument supplied one of the recollections which\r\n     Moses and the Israelites bore from Egypt into the desert.\r\n     Perchance, on beholding the cloudy pillar and fiery column, they\r\n     whispered awe-stricken to one another, 'In its shape it is like\r\n     that old obelisk which we and our fathers have so often seen on the\r\n     borders of the Nile.' And now that very obelisk, with hardly a\r\n     trace of decay upon it, is the first thing that the modern\r\n     traveller sees after entering the Flaminian Gate.\"--_Hawthorne's\r\n     Transformation._\r\n\r\nIt was on the left of the Piazza, at the foot of what was even then\r\ncalled \"the Hill of Gardens,\" that Nero was buried (A.D. 68).\r\n\r\n     \"When Nero was dead, his nurse Eclaga, with Alexandra, and Acte the\r\n     famous concubine, having wrapped his remains in rich white stuff,\r\n     embroidered with gold, deposited them in the Domitian monument,\r\n     which is seen in the Campus-Martius under the Hill of Gardens. The\r\n     tomb was of porphyry, having an altar of Luna marble, surrounded by\r\n     a balustrade of Thasos marble.\"--_Suetonius._\r\n\r\nChurch tradition tells that from the tomb of Nero afterwards grew a\r\ngigantic walnut-tree, which became the resort of innumerable crows,--so\r\nnumerous as to become quite a pest to the neighbourhood. In the eleventh\r\ncentury, Pope Paschal II. dreamt that these crows were demons, and that\r\nthe Blessed Virgin commanded him to cut down and burn the tree (\"albero\r\nmalnato\"), and build a sanctuary to her honour in its place. A church\r\nwas then built by means of a collection amongst the common people;\r\nhence the name which it still retains of \"St. Mary of the People.\"\r\n\r\n_Sta. Maria del Popolo_ was rebuilt by Bacio Pintelli for Sixtus IV. in\r\n1480, and very richly adorned. It was modernized by Bernini for\r\nAlexander VII. (Fabio Chigi, 1655-67), of whom it was the family\r\nburial-place, but it still retains many fragments of beautiful fifteenth\r\ncentury work (the principal door of the nave is a fine example of this);\r\nand its interior is a perfect museum of sculpture and art.\r\n\r\nEntering the church by the west door, and following the right aisle, the\r\nfirst chapel (Venuti, formerly Della Rovere[3]) is adorned with\r\nexquisite paintings by _Pinturicchio_. Over the altar is the\r\nNativity--one of the most beautiful frescoes in the city; in the\r\nlunettes are scenes from the life of St. Jerome. Cardinal Christoforo\r\ndella Rovere, who built this chapel and dedicated it to \"the Virgin and\r\nSt. Jerome,\" is buried on the left, in a grand fifteenth century tomb;\r\non the right is the monument of Cardinal di Castro. Both of these tombs\r\nand many others in this church have interesting and greatly varied\r\nlunettes of the Virgin and Child.\r\n\r\nThe second chapel, of the Cibo family, rich in pillars of nero-antico\r\nand jasper, has an altarpiece representing the Assumption of the Virgin,\r\nby _Carlo Maratta_. In the cupola is the Almighty, surrounded by the\r\nheavenly host.[4]\r\n\r\nThe third chapel is also painted by _Pinturicchio_. Over the altar, the\r\nMadonna and four saints; above, God the Father, surrounded by angels. In\r\nthe other lunettes, scenes in the life of the Virgin;--that of the\r\nVirgin studying in the Temple, a very rare subject, is especially\r\nbeautiful. In a frieze round the lower part of the wall, a series of\r\nmartyrdoms in grisaille. On the right is the tomb of Giovanni della\r\nRovere, ob. 1483. On the left is a fine sleeping bronze figure of a\r\nbishop, unknown.\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapel has a fine fifteenth century altar-relief of St.\r\nCatherine between St. Anthony of Padua and St. Vincent. On the right is\r\nthe tomb of Marc-Antonio Albertoni, ob. 1485; on the left, that of\r\nCardinal Costa, of Lisbon, ob. 1508, erected in his lifetime. In this\r\ntomb is an especially beautiful lunette of the Virgin adored by Angels.\r\n\r\nEntering the right transept, on the right is the tomb of Cardinal\r\nPodocanthorus of Cyprus, a very fine specimen of fifteenth century work.\r\nA door near this leads into a cloister, where is preserved, over a door,\r\nthe Gothic altar-piece of the church of Sixtus IV, representing the\r\nCoronation of the Virgin, and two fine tombs--Archbishop Rocca, ob.\r\n1482, and Bishop Gomiel.\r\n\r\nThe choir (shown when there is no service) has a ceiling by\r\n_Pinturicchio_. In the centre, the Virgin and Saviour, surrounded by the\r\nEvangelists and Sibyls; in the corners, the Fathers of the\r\nChurch--Gregory, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine. Beneath are the tombs\r\nof Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, and Cardinal Girolamo Basso, nephews of\r\nSixtus IV. (Francesco della Rovere), beautiful works of _Andrea di\r\nSansovino_. These tombs were erected at the expense of Julius II.,\r\nhimself a Della Rovere, who also gave the windows, painted by _Claude\r\nand Guillaume de Marseilles_, the only good specimens of stained glass\r\nin Rome.\r\n\r\nThe high-altar is surmounted by a miraculous image of the Virgin,\r\ninscribed, \"In honorificentia populi nostri,\" which was placed in this\r\nchurch by Gregory IX., and which, having been \"successfully invoked\" by\r\nGregory XIII., in the great plague of 1578, has ever since been annually\r\nadored by the pope of the period, who prostrates himself before it upon\r\nthe 8th of September. The chapel on the left of this has an Assumption,\r\nby _Annibale Caracci_.\r\n\r\nIn the left transept is the tomb of Cardinal Bernardino Lonati, with a\r\nfine fifteenth century relief of the Resurrection.\r\n\r\nReturning by the left aisle, the last chapel but one is that of the\r\nChigi family, in which the famous banker, Agostino Chigi (who built the\r\nFarnesina) is buried, and in which _Raphael_ is represented at once as a\r\npainter, a sculptor, and an architect. He planned the chapel itself; he\r\ndrew the strange design of the Mosaic on the ceiling (carried out by\r\n_Aloisio della Pace_), which represents an extraordinary mixture of\r\nPaganism and Christianity, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn (as\r\nthe planets), conducted by angels, being represented with and\r\nsurrounding Jehovah; and he modelled the beautiful statue of Jonah\r\nseated on the whale, which was sculptured in the marble by _Lorenzetto_.\r\nThe same artist sculptured the figure of Elijah,--those of Daniel and\r\nHabakkuk being by _Bernini_. The altarpiece, representing the Nativity\r\nof the Virgin, is a fine work of _Sebastian del Piombo_. On the pier\r\nadjoining this chapel is the strange monument by _Posi_ (1771) of a\r\nPrincess Odescalchi Chigi, who died in childbirth, at the age of twenty,\r\nerected by her husband, who describes himself, \"In solitudine et luctu\r\nsuperstes.\"\r\n\r\nThe last chapel contains two fine fifteenth century ciboria, and the\r\ntomb of Cardinal Antonio Pallavicini, 1507.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the principal entrance is the remarkable monument of Gio.\r\nBatt. Gislenus, the companion and friend of Casimir I. of Poland (ob.\r\n1670). At the top is his portrait while living, inscribed, \"Neque hic\r\nvivus\"; then a medallion of a chrysalis, \"In nidulo meo moriar\";\r\nopposite to which is a medallion of a butterfly emerging, \"Ut Phœnix\r\nmultiplicabo dies\": below is a hideous skeleton of giallo antico in a\r\nwhite marble winding-sheet, \"Neque hic mortuus.\"\r\n\r\n     Martin Luther \"often spoke of death as the Christian's true birth,\r\n     and this life as but a growing into the chrysalis-shell in which\r\n     the spirit lives till its being is developed, and it bursts the\r\n     shell, casts off the web, struggles into life, spreads its wings,\r\n     and soars up to God.\"\r\n\r\nThe Augustine Convent adjoining this church was the residence of Luther\r\nwhile he was in Rome. Here he celebrated mass immediately on his\r\narrival, after he had prostrated himself upon the earth, saying, \"Hail\r\nsacred Rome! thrice sacred for the blood of the martyrs shed here!\"\r\nHere, also, he celebrated mass for the last time before he departed from\r\nRome to become the most terrible of her enemies.\r\n\r\n     \"Lui pauvre écolier, élevé si durement, qui souvent, pendant son\r\n     enfance, n'avait pour oreiller qu'une dalle froide, il passe devant\r\n     des temples tout de marbre, devant des colonnes d'albâtre, des\r\n     gigantesques obélisques de granite, des fontaines jaillissantes,\r\n     des _villas_ fraîches et embellies de jardins, de fleurs, de\r\n     cascades et de grottes. Veut-il prier? il entre dans une église qui\r\n     lui semble un monde véritable, où les diamants scintillent sur\r\n     l'autel, l'or aux soffites, le marbre aux colonnes, la mosaïque aux\r\n     chapelles, au lieu d'un de ces temples rustiques qui n'ont dans sa\r\n     patrie pour tout ornement que quelques roses qu'une main pieuse va\r\n     déposer sur l'autel le jour du dimanche. Est-il fatigué de la\r\n     route? il trouve sur son chemin, non plus un modeste banc de bois,\r\n     mais un siège d'albâtre antique récemment déterré. Cherche-t-il une\r\n     sainte image? il n'aperçoit que des fantaisies païennes, des\r\n     divinités olympiques, Apollon, Vénus, Mars, Jupiter, auxquelles\r\n     travaillent mille mains de sculpteurs. De toutes ces merveilles, il\r\n     ne comprit rien, il ne vit rien. Aucun rayon de la couronne de\r\n     Raphaël, de Michel-Ange, n'éblouit ses regards; il resta froid et\r\n     muet devant tous les trésors de peinture et de sculpture rassemblés\r\n     dans les églises; son oreille fut fermée aux chants du Dante, que\r\n     le peuple répétait autour de lui. Il était entré à Rome en pèlerin,\r\n     il en sort comme Coriolan, et s'écrie avec Bembo: 'Adieu, Rome, que\r\n     doit fuir quiconque veut vivre saintement! Adieu, ville où tout est\r\n     permis, excepté d'être homme de bien.'\"--_Audin, Histoire de\r\n     Luther_, c. ii.\r\n\r\nIt was in front of this church that the cardinals and magnates of Rome\r\nmet to receive the apostate Christina of Sweden upon her entrance into\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the left side of the piazza rise the terraces of the Pincio, adorned\r\nwith rostral-columns, statues, and marble bas-reliefs, interspersed with\r\ncypresses and pines. A winding road, lined with mimosas and other\r\nflowering shrubs, leads to the upper platform, now laid out in public\r\ndrives and gardens, but, till twenty years ago, a deserted waste, where\r\nthe ghost of Nero was believed to wander in the middle ages.\r\n\r\nHence the Eternal City is seen spread at our feet, and beyond it the\r\nwide-spreading Campagna, till a silver line marks the sea melting into\r\nthe horizon beyond Ostia. All these churches and tall palace roofs\r\nbecome more than mere names in the course of the winter, but at first\r\nall is bewilderment Two great buildings alone arrest the attention:\r\n\r\n     \"Westward, beyond the Tiber, is the Castle of St. Angelo, the\r\n     immense tomb of a pagan emperor with the archangel on its\r\n     summit.... Still further off, a mighty pile of buildings,\r\n     surmounted by a vast dome, which all of us have shaped and swelled\r\n     outward, like a huge bubble, to the utmost scope of our\r\n     imaginations, long before we see it floating over the worship of\r\n     the city. At any nearer view the grandeur of St. Peter's hides\r\n     itself behind the immensity of its separate parts, so that we only\r\n     see the front, only the sides, only the pillared length and\r\n     loftiness of the portico, and not the mighty whole. But at this\r\n     distance the entire outline of the world's cathedral, as well as\r\n     that of the palace of the world's chief priest, is taken in at\r\n     once. In such remoteness, moreover, the imagination is not debarred\r\n     from rendering its assistance, even while we have the reality\r\n     before our eyes, and helping the weakness of human sense to do\r\n     justice to so grand an object. It requires both faith and fancy to\r\n     enable us to feel, what is nevertheless so true, that yonder, in\r\n     front of the purple outline of the hills, is the grandest edifice\r\n     ever built by man, painted against God's loveliest\r\n     sky.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\nHere the band plays under the great palm-tree every afternoon except\r\nFriday. On Sunday afternoons the Pincio is in what Miss Thackeray\r\ndescribes as \"a fashionable halo of sunset and pink parasols\"--when\r\nimmense crowds collect, showing every phase of Roman life; and disperse\r\nagain as the Ave-Maria bell rings from the churches, either to descend\r\ninto the city, or to hear benediction sung by the nuns in the Trinità\r\nde' Monti.\r\n\r\n     \"When the fashionable hour of rendezvous arrives, the same spot,\r\n     which a few minutes before was immersed in silence and solitude,\r\n     changes as it were with the rapidity of a scene in a pantomime to\r\n     an animated panorama. The scene is rendered not a little ludicrous\r\n     by the miniature representation of the Ring in Hyde Park in a small\r\n     compass. An entire revolution of the carriage-drive is performed in\r\n     the short period of three minutes as near as may be, and the\r\n     perpetual occurrence of the same physiognomies and the same\r\n     carriages trotting round and round for two successive hours,\r\n     necessarily reminds one of the proceedings of a country fair, and\r\n     children whirling in a roundabout.\"--_Sir G. Head's 'Tour in\r\n     Rome.'_\r\n\r\n     \"The Pincian Hill is the favourite promenade of the Roman\r\n     aristocracy. At the present day, however, like most other Roman\r\n     possessions, it belongs less to the native inhabitants than to the\r\n     barbarians from Gaul, Great Britain, and beyond the sea, who have\r\n     established a peaceful usurpation over all that is enjoyable or\r\n     memorable in the Eternal City. These foreign guests are indeed\r\n     ungrateful, if they do not breathe a prayer for Pope Clement, or\r\n     whatever Holy Father it may have been, who levelled the summit of\r\n     the mount so skilfully, and bounded it with the parapet of the city\r\n     wall; who laid out those broad walks and drives, and overhung them\r\n     with the shade of many kinds of tree; who scattered the flowers of\r\n     all seasons, and of every clime, abundantly over those smooth,\r\n     central lawns; who scooped out hollows in fit places, and setting\r\n     great basons of marble in them, caused ever-gushing fountains to\r\n     fill them to the brim; who reared up the immemorial obelisk out of\r\n     the soil that had long hidden it; who placed pedestals along the\r\n     borders of the avenues, and covered them with busts of that\r\n     multitude of worthies,--statesmen, heroes, artists, men of letters\r\n     and of song,--whom the whole world claims as its chief ornaments,\r\n     though Italy has produced them all. In a word, the Pincian garden\r\n     is one of the things that reconcile the stranger (since he fully\r\n     appreciates the enjoyment, and feels nothing of the cost,) to the\r\n     rule of an irresponsible dynasty of Holy Fathers, who seem to have\r\n     arrived at making life as agreeable an affair as it can well be.\r\n\r\n     \"In this pleasant spot the red-trousered French soldiers are always\r\n     to be seen; bearded and grizzled veterans, perhaps, with medals of\r\n     Algiers or the Crimea on their breasts. To them is assigned the\r\n     peaceful duty of seeing that children do not trample on the\r\n     flower-beds, nor any youthful lover rifle them of their fragrant\r\n     blossoms to stick in his beloved one's hair. Here sits (drooping\r\n     upon some marble bench, in the treacherous sunshine,) the\r\n     consumptive girl, whose friends have brought her, for a cure, into\r\n     a climate that instils poison into its very purest breath. Here,\r\n     all day, come nursery maids, burdened with rosy English babies, or\r\n     guiding the footsteps of little travellers from the far western\r\n     world. Here, in the sunny afternoon, roll and rumble all kinds of\r\n     carriages, from the Cardinal's old-fashioned and gorgeous purple\r\n     carriage to the gay barouche of modern date. Here horsemen gallop\r\n     on thorough-bred steeds. Here, in short, all the transitory\r\n     population of Rome, the world's great watering-place, rides,\r\n     drives, or promenades! Here are beautiful sunsets; and here,\r\n     whichever way you turn your eyes, are scenes as well worth gazing\r\n     at, both in themselves and for their historical interest, as any\r\n     that the sun ever rose and set upon. Here, too, on certain\r\n     afternoons in the week, a French military band flings out rich\r\n     music over the poor old city, floating her with strains as loud as\r\n     those of her own echoless triumphs.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\nThe garden of the Pincio is very small, but beautifully laid out. At a\r\ncrossroads is placed an _Obelisk_, brought from Egypt, and which the\r\nlate discoveries in hieroglyphics show to have been erected there, in\r\nthe joint names of Hadrian and his empress Sabina, to their beloved\r\nAntinous, who was drowned in the Nile A.D. 131.\r\n\r\nFrom the furthest angle of the garden we look down upon the strange\r\nfragment of wall known as the _Muro-Torto_.\r\n\r\n     \"Le Muro-Torto offre un souvenir curieux. On nomme ainsi un pan de\r\n     muraille qui, avant de faire partie du rempart d'Honorius, avait\r\n     servi à soutenir la terrasse du jardin du Domitius, et qui, du\r\n     temps de Bélisaire, était déjà incliné comme il l'est aujourd'hui.\r\n     Procope racconte que Bélisaire voulait le rebâtir, mais que les\r\n     Romains l'en empêchèrent, affirmant que ce point n'était pas\r\n     exposé, parce que Saint Pierre avait promis de le défendre. Procope\r\n     ajoute: 'Personne n'a osé réparer ce mur, et il reste encore dans\r\n     le même état.' Nous pouvons en dire autant que Procope, et le mur,\r\n     détaché de la colline à laquelle il s'appuyait, reste encore\r\n     incliné et semble près de tomber. Ce détail du siége de Rome est\r\n     confirmé par l'aspect singulier du Muro-Torto, qui _semble toujours\r\n     près de tomber_, et subsiste dans le même état depuis quatorze\r\n     siècles, comme s'il était soutenu miraculeusement par la main de\r\n     Saint Pierre. On ne saurait guère trouver pour l'autorité temporel\r\n     des papes, un meilleur symbole.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 397.\r\n\r\n     \"At the furthest point of the Pincio, you look down from the\r\n     parapet upon the Muro-Torto, a massive fragment of the oldest Roman\r\n     wall, which juts over, as if ready to tumble down by its own\r\n     weight, yet seems still the most indestructible piece of work that\r\n     men's hands ever piled together. In the blue distance rise Soracte,\r\n     and other heights, which have gleamed afar, to our imagination, but\r\n     look scarcely real to our bodily eyes, because, being dreamed about\r\n     so much, they have taken the aerial tints which belong only to a\r\n     dream. These, nevertheless, are the solid framework of hills that\r\n     shut in Rome, and its broad surrounding Campagna; no land of\r\n     dreams, but the broadest page of history, crowded so full with\r\n     memorable events, that one obliterates another, as if Time had\r\n     crossed and recrossed his own records till they grew\r\n     illegible.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\nIn early imperial times the site of the Pincio garden was occupied by\r\nthe famous villa of Lucullus, who had gained his enormous wealth as\r\ngeneral of the Roman armies in Asia.\r\n\r\n     \"The life of Lucullus was like an ancient comedy, where first we\r\n     see great actions, both political and military, and afterwards\r\n     feasts, debauches, races by torchlight, and every kind of frivolous\r\n     amusement. For among frivolous amusements, I cannot but reckon his\r\n     sumptuous villas, walks, and baths; and still more so the\r\n     paintings, statues, and other works of art which he collected at\r\n     immense expense, idly squandering away upon them the vast fortune\r\n     he amassed in the wars. Insomuch that now, when luxury is so much\r\n     advanced, the gardens of Lucullus rank with those of the kings, and\r\n     are esteemed the most magnificent even of these.\"--_Plutarch._\r\n\r\nHere, in his Pincian villa, Lucullus gave his celebrated feast to Cicero\r\nand Pompey, merely mentioning to a slave beforehand that he should sup\r\nin the hall of Apollo, which was understood as a command to prepare all\r\nthat was most sumptuous.\r\n\r\n     After Lucullus--the beautiful Pincian villa belonged to Valerius\r\n     Asiaticus, and in the reign of Claudius was coveted by his fifth\r\n     wife, Messalina. She suborned Silius, her son's tutor, to accuse\r\n     him of a licentious life, and of corrupting the army. Being\r\n     condemned to death, \"Asiaticus declined the counsel of his friends\r\n     to starve himself, a course which might leave an interval for the\r\n     chance of pardon; and after the lofty fashion of the ancient\r\n     Romans, bathed, perfumed, and supped magnificently, and then opened\r\n     his veins, and let himself bleed to death. Before dying he\r\n     inspected the pyre prepared for him in his own gardens, and ordered\r\n     it to be removed to another spot, that an umbrageous plantation\r\n     which overhung it might not be injured by the flames.\"\r\n\r\n     As soon as she heard of his death, Messalina took possession of the\r\n     villa, and held high revel there with her numerous lovers, with the\r\n     most favoured of whom, Silius, she had actually gone through the\r\n     religious rites of marriage in the lifetime of the emperor, who was\r\n     absent at Ostia. But a conspiracy among the freedmen of the royal\r\n     household informed the emperor of what was taking place, and at\r\n     last even Claudius was aroused to a sense of her enormities.\r\n\r\n     \"In her suburban palace, Messalina was abandoning herself to\r\n     voluptuous transports. The season was mid-autumn, the vintage was\r\n     in full progress; the wine-press was groaning; the ruddy juice was\r\n     streaming; women girt with scanty fawnskins danced as drunken\r\n     Bacchanals around her: while she herself, with her hair loose and\r\n     disordered, brandished the thyrsus in the midst, and Silius by her\r\n     side, buskined and crowned with ivy, tossed his head to the\r\n     flaunting strains of Silenus and the Satyrs. Vettius, one, it\r\n     seems, of the wanton's less fortunate paramours, attended the\r\n     ceremony, and climbed in merriment a lofty tree in the garden. When\r\n     asked what he saw, he replied, 'an awful storm from Ostia'; and\r\n     whether there was actually such an appearance, or whether the words\r\n     were spoken at random, they were accepted afterwards as an omen of\r\n     the catastrophe which quickly followed.\r\n\r\n     \"For now in the midst of these wanton orgies the rumour quickly\r\n     spread, and swiftly messengers arrived to confirm it, that Claudius\r\n     knew it all, that Claudius was on his way to Rome, and was coming\r\n     in anger and vengeance. The lovers part: Silius for the forum and\r\n     the tribunals; Messalina for the shade of her gardens on the\r\n     Pincio, the price of the blood of the murdered Asiaticus.\" Once the\r\n     empress attempted to go forth to meet Claudius, taking her children\r\n     with her, and accompanied by Vibidia, the eldest of the vestal\r\n     virgins, whom she persuaded to intercede for her, but her enemies\r\n     prevented her gaining access to her husband; Vibidia was satisfied\r\n     for the moment by vague promises of a later hearing; and upon the\r\n     arrival of Claudius in Rome, Silius and the other principal lovers\r\n     of the empress were put to death. \"Still Messalina hoped. She had\r\n     withdrawn again to the gardens of Lucullus, and was there engaged\r\n     in composing addresses of supplication to her husband, in which her\r\n     pride and long-accustomed insolence still faintly struggled into\r\n     her fears. The emperor still paltered with the treason. He had\r\n     retired to his palace; he had bathed, anointed, and lain down to\r\n     supper; and, warmed with wine and generous cheer, he had actually\r\n     despatched a message to the _poor creature_, as he called her,\r\n     bidding her come the next day, and plead her cause before him. But\r\n     her enemy Narcissus, knowing how easy might be the passage from\r\n     compassion to love, glided from the chamber, and boldly ordered a\r\n     tribune and some centurions to go and slay his victim. 'Such,' he\r\n     said, 'was the emperor's command'; and his word was obeyed without\r\n     hesitation. Under the direction of the freedman Euodus, the armed\r\n     men sought the outcast in her gardens, where she lay prostrate on\r\n     the ground, by the side of her mother Lepida. While their fortunes\r\n     flourished, dissensions had existed between the two; but now, in\r\n     her last distress, the mother had refused to desert her child, and\r\n     only strove to nerve her resolution to a voluntary death. 'Life,'\r\n     she urged, 'is over; nought remains but to look for a decent exit\r\n     from it.' But the soul of the reprobate was corrupted by her vices;\r\n     she retained no sense of honour; she continued to weep and groan as\r\n     if hope still existed; when suddenly the doors were burst open, the\r\n     tribune and his swordsmen appeared before her, and Euodus assailed\r\n     her, dumb-stricken as she lay, with contumelious and brutal\r\n     reproaches. Roused at last to the consciousness of her desperate\r\n     condition, she took a weapon from one of the men's hands and\r\n     pressed it trembling against her throat and bosom. Still she wanted\r\n     resolution to give the thrust, and it was by a blow of the\r\n     tribune's falchion that the horrid deed was finally accomplished.\r\n     The death of Asiaticus was avenged on the very spot; the hot blood\r\n     of the wanton smoked on the pavement of his gardens, and stained\r\n     with a deeper hue the variegated marbles of Lucullus.\"--_Merivale,\r\n     Hist. of the Romans under the Empire._\r\n\r\nFrom the garden of the Pincio a terraced road (beneath which are the\r\nlong-closed catacombs of St. Felix) leads to the _Villa Medici_, built\r\nfor Cardinal Ricci da Montepulciano by Annibale Lippi in 1540. Shortly\r\nafterwards it passed into the hands of the Medici family, and was\r\ngreatly enlarged by Cardinal Alessandro de Medici, afterwards Leo XI. In\r\n1801 the Academy for French Art-Students, founded by Louis XIV., was\r\nestablished here. The villa contains a fine collection of casts, open\r\nevery day except Sunday.\r\n\r\nBehind the villa is a beautiful _Garden_ (which can be visited on\r\napplication to the porter). The terrace, which looks down upon the Villa\r\nBorghese, is bordered by ancient sarcophagi, and has a colossal statue\r\nof Rome. The garden side of the villa has sometimes been ascribed to\r\nMichael Angelo.\r\n\r\n     \"La plus grande coquetterie de la maison, c'est la façade\r\n     postérieure. Elle tient son rang parmi les chefs-d'œuvre de la\r\n     Renaissance. On dirait que l'architecte a épuisé une mine de\r\n     bas-reliefs grecs et romains pour en tapisser son palais. Le jardin\r\n     est de la même époque: il date du temps où l'aristocratie romaine\r\n     professait le plus profond dédain pour les fleurs. On n'y voit que\r\n     des massifs de verdure, alignés avec un soin scrupuleux. Six\r\n     pelouses, entourées de haies à hauteur d'appui, s'étendent devant\r\n     la villa et laissent courir la vue jusqu'au mont Soracte, qui ferme\r\n     l'horizon. A gauche, quatre fois quatre carrés de gazon s'encadrent\r\n     dans de hautes murailles de lauriers, de buis gigantesques et de\r\n     chênes verts. Les murailles se rejoignent au-dessus des allées et\r\n     les enveloppent d'une ombre fraîche et mystérieuse. A droite, une\r\n     terrasse d'une style noble encadre un bois de chênes verts, tordus\r\n     et eventrés par le temps. J'y vais quelquefois travailler à\r\n     l'ombre; et le merle rivalise avec le rossignol au-dessus de ma\r\n     tête, comme un beau chantre de village peut rivaliser avec Mario ou\r\n     Roger. Un peu plus loin, une vigne toute rustique s'étend jusqu'à\r\n     la porte Pinciana, où Belisaire a mendié, dit-on. Les jardins\r\n     petits et grands sont semés de statues, d'Hermes, et de marbres de\r\n     toute sorte. L'eau coule dans des sarcophages antiques ou jaillit\r\n     dans des vasques de marbre: le marbre et l'eau sont les deux luxes\r\n     de Rome.\"--_About, Rome Contemporaine._\r\n\r\n     \"The grounds of the Villa Medici are laid out in the old fashion of\r\n     straight paths, with borders of box, which form hedges of great\r\n     height and density, and are shorn and trimmed to the evenness of a\r\n     wall of stone, at the top and sides. There are green alleys, with\r\n     long vistas, overshadowed by ilex-trees; and at each intersection\r\n     of the paths the visitor finds seats of lichen-covered stone to\r\n     repose upon, and marble statues that look forlornly at him,\r\n     regretful of their lost noses. In the more open portions of the\r\n     garden, before the sculptured front of the villa, you see fountains\r\n     and flower-beds; and, in their season, a profusion of roses, from\r\n     which the genial sun of Italy distils a fragrance, to be scattered\r\n     abroad by the no less genial breeze.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\nA second door will admit to the higher terrace of _the Boschetto_; a\r\ntiny wood of ancient ilexes, from which a steep flight of steps leads to\r\nthe \"Belvidere,\" whence there is a beautiful view.\r\n\r\n     \"They asked the porter for the key of the Bosco, which was given,\r\n     and they entered a grove of ilexes, whose gloomy shade effectually\r\n     shut out the radiant sunshine that still illuminated the western\r\n     sky. They then ascended a long and exceedingly steep flight of\r\n     steps, leading up to a high mound covered with ilexes.\r\n\r\n     \"Here both stood still, side by side, gazing silently on the city,\r\n     where dome and bell-tower stood out against a sky of gold; the\r\n     desolate Monte Mario and its stone pines rising dark to the right.\r\n     Behind, close at hand, were sombre ilex woods, amid which rose here\r\n     and there the spire of a cypress or a ruined arch, and on the\r\n     highest point, the white Villa Ludovisi; beyond, stretched the\r\n     Campagna, girdled by hills melting into light under the evening\r\n     sky.\"--_Mademoiselle Mori._\r\n\r\nFrom the door of the Villa Medici is the scene familiar to artists, of a\r\nfountain shaded by ilexes, which frame a distant view of St Peter's.\r\n\r\n     \"Je vois (de la Villa Medici) les quatre cinquièmes de la ville; je\r\n     compte les sept collines, je parcours les rues régulières qui\r\n     s'étendent entre le cours et la place d'Espagne, je fais le\r\n     d'enombrement des palais, des églises, des dômes, et des clochers;\r\n     je m'égare dans le Ghetto et dans la Trastévère. Je ne vois pas des\r\n     ruines autant que j'en voudrais: elles sont ramassées là-bas, sur\r\n     ma gauche, aux environs du Forum. Cependant nous avons tout près de\r\n     nous la colonne Antonine et la mausolée d'Adrien. La vue est fermée\r\n     agréablement par les pins de la villa Pamphili, qui reunissent\r\n     leurs larges parasols et font comme une table à mille pieds pour un\r\n     repas de géants. L'horizon fuit à gauche à des distances infinies;\r\n     la plaine est nue, onduleuse et bleue comme la mer. Mais si je vous\r\n     mettais en présence d'un spectacle si étendu et si divers, en seul\r\n     objet attirerait vos regards, un seul frapperait votre attention:\r\n     vous n'auriez des yeux que pour Saint Pierre. Son dôme est moitié\r\n     dans la ville, moitié dans la ciel. Quand j'ouvre ma fenêtre, vers\r\n     cinq heures du matin, je vois Rome noyée dans les brouillards de la\r\n     fièvre: seul, le dôme de Saint-Pierre est coloré par la lumière\r\n     rose du soleil levant.\"--_About._\r\n\r\nThe terrace (\"La Passeggiata\") ends at the _Obelisk of the Trinità de'\r\nMonti_, erected here in 1822 by Pius VII., who found it near the Church\r\nof Sta. Croce in Gerusalemme.\r\n\r\n     \"When the Ave Maria sounds, it is time to go to the church of\r\n     Trinità de' Monti, where French nuns sing; and it is charming to\r\n     hear them. I declare to heaven that I am become quite tolerant, and\r\n     listen to bad music with edification; but what can I do? The\r\n     composition is perfectly ridiculous, the organ-playing even more\r\n     absurd: but it is twilight, and the whole of the small bright\r\n     church is filled with persons kneeling, lit up by the sinking sun\r\n     each time that the door is opened; both the singing nuns have the\r\n     sweetest voices in the world, quite tender and touching, more\r\n     especially when one of them sings the responses in her melodious\r\n     voice, which we are accustomed to hear chaunted by priests in a\r\n     loud, harsh, monotonous tone. The impression is very singular;\r\n     moreover, it is well known that no one is permitted to see the fair\r\n     singers, so this caused me to form a strange resolution. I have\r\n     composed something to suit their voices, which I have observed very\r\n     minutely, and I mean to send it to them. It will be pleasant to\r\n     hear my chaunt performed by persons I never saw, especially as they\r\n     must in turn sing it to the 'barbaro Tedescho,' whom they also\r\n     never beheld.\"--_Mendelssohn's Letters._\r\n\r\n     \"In the evenings people go to the Trinità to hear the nuns sing\r\n     from the organ-gallery. It sounds like the singing of angels. One\r\n     sees in the choir troops of young scholars, moving with slow and\r\n     measured steps, with their long white veils, like a flock of\r\n     spirits.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\n_The Church of the Trinità de' Monti_ was built in 1495 by Charles VIII.\r\nof France, at the request of S. Francesco di Paola. At the time of the\r\nFrench revolution it was plundered, but was restored by Louis XVIII. in\r\n1817. It contains several interesting paintings.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapel on the left is the Descent from the Cross, the\r\nmasterpiece of _Daniele da Volterra_, declared by Nicholas Poussin to be\r\nthe third picture in the world, but terribly injured by the French in\r\ntheir attempts to remove it.\r\n\r\n     \"We might almost fancy ourselves spectators of the mournful\r\n     scene,--the Redeemer, while being removed from the cross, gradually\r\n     sinking down with all that relaxation of limb and utter\r\n     helplessness which belongs to a dead body; the assistants engaged\r\n     in their various duties, and thrown into different and contrasted\r\n     attitudes, intently occupied with the sacred remains which they so\r\n     reverently gaze upon; the mother of the Lord in a swoon amidst her\r\n     afflicted companions; the disciple whom he loved standing with\r\n     outstretched arms, absorbed in contemplating the mysterious\r\n     spectacle. The truth in the representation of the exposed parts of\r\n     the body appears to be nature itself. The colouring of the heads\r\n     and of the whole picture accords precisely with the subject,\r\n     displaying strength rather than delicacy, a harmony, and in short a\r\n     degree of skill, of which M. Angelo himself might have been proud,\r\n     if the picture had been inscribed with his name. And to this I\r\n     believe the author alluded, when he painted his friend with a\r\n     looking-glass near it, as if to intimate that he might recognize in\r\n     the picture a reflection of himself.\"--_Lanzi._\r\n\r\n     \"Daniele da Volterra's Descent from the Cross is one of the\r\n     celebrated pictures of the world, and has very grand features. The\r\n     body is not skilfully sustained; nevertheless the number of strong\r\n     men employed about it makes up in sheer muscle for the absence of\r\n     skill. Here are four ladders against the cross, stalwart figures\r\n     standing, ascending, and descending upon each, so that the space\r\n     between the cross and the ground is absolutely alive with\r\n     magnificent lines. The Virgin lies on one side, and is like a grand\r\n     creature struck down by a sudden death-blow. She has fallen, like\r\n     Ananias in Raphael's cartoon, with her head bent backwards, and her\r\n     arm under her. The crown of thorns has been taken from the dead\r\n     brow, and rests on the end of one of the ladders.\"--_Lady\r\n     Eastlake._\r\n\r\nThe third chapel on the right contains an Assumption of the Virgin,\r\nanother work of _Daniele da Volterra_. The fifth chapel is adorned with\r\nfrescoes of his school. The sixth has frescoes of the school of\r\n_Perugino_. The frescoes in the right transept are by _F. Zuccaro_ and\r\n_Pierino del Vaga_; in that of the Procession of St. Gregory the\r\nmausoleum of Hadrian is represented as it appeared in the time of Leo X.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining _Convent of the Sacré Cœur_ is much frequented as a\r\nplace of education. The nuns are all persons of rank. When a lady takes\r\nthe veil, her nearest relations inherit her property, except about\r\n1000_l._, which goes to the convent. The nuns are allowed to retain no\r\npersonal property, but if they wish still to have the use of their\r\nbooks, they give them to the convent library. They receive visitors\r\nevery afternoon, and quantities of people go to them from curiosity, on\r\nthe plea of seeking advice.\r\n\r\nFrom the Trinità the two popular streets--Sistina and\r\nGregoriana--branch off; the former leading in a direct line (though the\r\nname changes) to Sta. Maria Maggiore, and thence to St. John Lateran and\r\nSta. Croce in Gerusalemme. The house adjoining the Trinità was that of\r\nNicholas Poussin; that at the angle of the two streets, called the\r\n_Tempietto_, was once inhabited by Claude Lorraine. The adjoining house\r\n(64 Sistina)--formerly known as Palazzo della Regina di Polonia, from\r\nMaria Casimira, Queen of Poland, who resided there for some years--was\r\ninhabited by the Zuccari family, and has paintings on the ground-floor\r\nby _Federigo Zuccaro_. One of the rooms on the first-floor was adorned\r\nwith frescoes by modern German artists at the expense of the Prussian\r\nconsul Bartholdy, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    The Selling of Joseph: _Overbeck._\r\n    Joseph and Potiphar's Wife: _Veit._\r\n    Meeting of Joseph and his Brethren: _Cornelius._\r\n    The Seven Lean Years: _Overbeck._\r\n    Joseph interprets the Dreams in Prison: _Schadow._\r\n    The Brethren bring Joseph's Coat to Jacob: _Schadow._\r\n    Joseph interprets the Dreams of Pharaoh: _Cornelius._\r\n    The Seven Plentiful Years: _Veit._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the left of the Piazza del Popolo, the _Via Babuino_ branches off,\r\nderiving its name from the mutilated figure on a fountain halfway down.\r\nOn the right is the Greek _Church of S. Atanasio_, attached to a college\r\nfounded by Gregory XIII. in 1580.\r\n\r\n     \"To-day, the feast of the Epiphany, I have witnessed mass according\r\n     to the Greek rite. The ceremonies appear to be more stately, more\r\n     severe, more significant, and at the same time more popular, than\r\n     those of the Latin rite.\"--_Goethe, Romische Briefe._\r\n\r\nBehind this street is the _Via Margutta_, almost entirely inhabited by\r\nartists and sculptors.\r\n\r\n     \"The Via Margutta is a street of studios and stables, crossed at\r\n     the upper end by a little roofed gallery with a single window, like\r\n     a shabby Bridge of Sighs. Horses are continually being washed and\r\n     currycombed outside their stable doors; frequent heaps of\r\n     _immondeazzajo_ make the air unfragrant; and the perspective is\r\n     frequently damaged by rows of linen suspended across the road from\r\n     window to window. Unsightly as they are, however, these obstacles\r\n     in no wise affect the popularity of the Via Margutta, either as a\r\n     residence for the artist, or a lounge for the amateur. Fashionable\r\n     patrons leave their carriages at the corner, and pick their way\r\n     daintily among the gutters and dust-heaps. A boar-hunt by Vallatti\r\n     compensates for an unlucky splash; and a campagna sunset of\r\n     Desoulavey glows all the richer for the squalor through which it is\r\n     approached.\"--_Barbara's History._\r\n\r\nIn this street also is situated the _Costume Academy_.\r\n\r\n     \"Imagine a great barn of a room, with dingy walls half covered with\r\n     chalk studies of the figure in all possible attitudes. Opposite the\r\n     door is a low platform with revolving top, and beside it an\r\n     _écorché_, or plaster figure bereft of skin, so as to exhibit the\r\n     muscles. Ranges of benches, raised one above the other, occupy the\r\n     remainder of the room; and if you were to look in at about eight\r\n     o'clock on a winter's evening, you would find them tenanted by a\r\n     multitude of young artists, mostly in their shirt sleeves, with\r\n     perhaps three or four ladies, all disposed around the model, who\r\n     stands upon the platform in one of the picturesque costumes of\r\n     Southern Italy, with a cluster of eight lamps, intensified by a\r\n     powerful reflector, immediately above his or her unlucky head.\r\n\r\n     The costumes are regulated by Church times and seasons. During Lent\r\n     the models were mediæval dresses; during the winter and carnival,\r\n     Italian costumes of the present day; and with Easter begin mere\r\n     draperies, _pieghe_, or folds, as they are technically called.\r\n\r\n     Every evening the subject for the next night is chalked up on a\r\n     black board beside the platform; for the next _two_ nights rather;\r\n     for each model poses for two evenings; the position of his feet\r\n     being chalked upon the platform, so as to secure the same attitude\r\n     on the second evening. Consequently, four hours are allowed for\r\n     each drawing.... The _pieghe_ are only for a single time, as it\r\n     would be impossible to secure the same folds twice over.... The\r\n     expense of attending the Academy, including attendance, each\r\n     person's share in the model, and his own especial lamp, amounts to\r\n     2½_d._ an evening, or a scudo and a half (about 6_s._ 6_d._) a\r\n     month; marvellously cheap, it most be confessed.\"--_H. M. B._, in\r\n     _Once a Week_.\r\n\r\nThe Babuino ends in the ugly but central square of the _Piazza di\r\nSpagna_, where many of the best hotels and shops are situated. Hence the\r\nTrinità is reached by a magnificent flight of steps (disgracefully ill\r\nkept), which was built by Alessandro Specchi at the expense of a private\r\nindividual, M. Gueffier, secretary to the French embassy at Rome, under\r\nInnocent XIII.\r\n\r\n     \"No art-loving visitor to Rome can ever have passed the noble\r\n     flight of steps which leads from the Piazza di Spagna to the Church\r\n     of the Trinità de' Monti without longing to transfer to his\r\n     sketch-book the picturesque groups of models who there spend their\r\n     day, basking in the beams of the wintry sun, and eating those\r\n     little boiled beans whose yellow husks bestrew every place where\r\n     the lower class Romans congregate--practising, in short, the 'dolce\r\n     far niente.' Beppo, the celebrated lame beggar, is no longer to be\r\n     seen there, having been banished to the steps of the Church of St.\r\n     Agostino; but there is old Felice, with conical hat, brown cloak,\r\n     and bagpipes, father of half the models on the steps. He has been\r\n     seen in an artist's studio in Paris, and is reported to have\r\n     performed on foot the double journey between Rome and that capital.\r\n     There are two or three younger men in blue jackets and goat-skin\r\n     breeches; as many women in folded linen head-dresses, and red or\r\n     blue skirts; and a sprinkling of children of both sexes, in\r\n     costumes the miniature fac-similes of their elders. All these\r\n     speedily learn to recognise a visitor who is interested in that\r\n     especial branch of art which is embodied in models, and at every\r\n     turn in the street such a one is met by the flash of white teeth,\r\n     and the gracious sweetness of an Italian smile.\"--_H. M. B._\r\n\r\n     \"Among what may be called the cubs or minor lions of Rome, there\r\n     was one that amused me mightily. It is always to be found there;\r\n     and its den is on the great flight of steps that lead from the\r\n     Piazza di Spagna to the Church of the Trinità de' Monti. In plainer\r\n     words, these steps are the great place of resort for the artists'\r\n     'Models,' and there they are constantly waiting to be hired. The\r\n     first time I went up there, I could not conceive why the faces\r\n     seemed so familiar to me; why they appeared to have beset me, for\r\n     years, in every possible variety of action and costume; and how it\r\n     came to pass that they started up before me, in Rome, in the broad\r\n     day, like so many saddled and bridled nightmares. I soon found that\r\n     we had made acquaintance, and improved it, for several years, on\r\n     the walls of various Exhibition Galleries. There is one old\r\n     gentleman with long white hair, and an immense beard, who, to my\r\n     knowledge, has gone half-through the catalogues of the Royal\r\n     Academy. This is the venerable or patriarchal model. He carries a\r\n     long staff; and every knob and twist in that staff I have seen,\r\n     faithfully delineated, innumerable times. There is another man in a\r\n     blue cloak, who always pretends to be asleep in the sun (when there\r\n     is any), and who, I need not say, is always very wide awake, and\r\n     very attentive to the disposition of his legs. This is the _dolce\r\n     far niente_ model. There is another man in a brown cloak, who leans\r\n     against a wall, with his arms folded in his mantle, and look out of\r\n     the corners of his eyes, which are just visible beneath his broad\r\n     slouched hat. This is the assassin model. There is another man, who\r\n     constantly looks over his own shoulder, and is always going away,\r\n     but never goes. This is the haughty or scornful model. As to\r\n     Domestic Happiness, and Holy Families, they should come very cheap,\r\n     for there are heaps of them, all up the steps; and the cream of the\r\n     thing is, that they are all the falsest vagabonds in the world,\r\n     especially made up for the purpose, and having no counterparts in\r\n     Rome or any other part of the habitable globe.\"--_Dickens._\r\n\r\n     \"Climb these steps when the sun is setting. From a hundred belfries\r\n     the bells ring for Ave Maria, and there, across the town, and in a\r\n     blaze of golden glory, stands the great dome of St. Peter's: and\r\n     from the terrace of the Villa Medici you can see the whole\r\n     wonderful view, faintly pencilled Soracte far to your right, and\r\n     below you and around you the City and the Seven Hills.\"--_Vera._\r\n\r\nThe _Barcaccia_, the fountain at the foot of the steps, executed by\r\n_Bernini_, is a stone boat commemorating the naumachia of\r\nDomitian,--naval battles which took place in an artificial lake\r\nsurrounded by a kind of theatre, which once occupied the site of this\r\npiazza. In front of the _Palazzo di Spagna_ (the residence of the\r\nSpanish ambassador), which gives its name to the square, stands a\r\n_Column_ of cipollino, supporting a statue of the Virgin, erected by\r\nPius IX. in 1854, in honour of his new dogma of the Immaculate\r\nConception. At the base are figures of Moses, David, Isaiah, and\r\nEzekiel.\r\n\r\nThe Piazza di Spagna may be considered as the centre of the English\r\nquarter, of which the Corso forms the boundary.\r\n\r\n     \"Every winter there is a gay and pleasant English colony in Rome,\r\n     of course more or less remarkable for rank, fashion, or\r\n     agreeability, with every varying year. Thrown together every day\r\n     and night after night, flocking to the same picture-galleries,\r\n     statue-galleries, Pincian drives, and church functions, the English\r\n     colonists at Rome perforce become intimate, and in many cases\r\n     friendly. They have an English library where the various meets for\r\n     the week are placarded: on such a day the Vatican galleries are\r\n     open; the next is the feast of Saint so-and-so; on Wednesday there\r\n     will be music and vespers at the Sistine Chapel; on Thursday the\r\n     pope will bless the animals--sheep, horses, and what-not; and\r\n     flocks of English accordingly rush to witness the benediction of\r\n     droves of donkeys. In a word, the ancient city of the Cæsars, the\r\n     august fanes of the popes, with their splendour and ceremony, are\r\n     all mapped out and arranged for English diversion.\"--Thackeray,\r\n     _The Newcomes._\r\n\r\nThe Piazza is closed by the _Collegio di Propaganda Fede_, founded in\r\n1622 by Gregory XV., but enlarged by Urban VIII., who built the present\r\nedifice from plans of Bernini. Like all the buildings erected by this\r\npope, its chief decorations are the bees of the Barberini. The object of\r\nthe college is the education of youths of all nations as missionaries.\r\n\r\n     \"The origin of the Propaganda is properly to be sought in an edict\r\n     of Gregory XIII., by which the direction of eastern missions was\r\n     confided to a certain number of cardinals, who were commanded to\r\n     promote the printing of catechisms in the less known tongues. But\r\n     the institution was not firmly established; it was unprovided with\r\n     the requisite means, and was by no means comprehensive in its\r\n     views. It was at the suggestion of the great preacher Girolamo da\r\n     Narni that the idea was first conceived of extending the\r\n     above-named institution. At his suggestion, a congregation was\r\n     established in all due form, and by this body regular meetings\r\n     were to be held for the guidance and conduct of missions in every\r\n     part of the world. The first funds were advanced by Gregory; his\r\n     nephew contributed from his private property; and since this\r\n     institution was in fact adapted to a want, the pressure of which\r\n     was then felt, it increased in prosperity and splendour. Who does\r\n     not know the services performed by the Propaganda for the diffusion\r\n     of philosophical studies? and not this only;--the institution has\r\n     generally laboured (in its earliest years most successfully,\r\n     perhaps) to fulfil its vocation in a liberal and noble\r\n     spirit.\"--_Ranke, Hist. of the Popes._\r\n\r\n     \"On y reçoit des jeunes gens nés dans les pays ultramontains et\r\n     orientaux, où sont les infidéles et les hérétiques; ils y font leur\r\n     education religieuse et civile, et retournent dans leur pays comme\r\n     missionnaires pour propager la loi.\"--_A.

The public is admitted by\r\ntickets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Via Ripetta_ leaves the Piazza del Popolo on the right. Passing, on\r\nthe right, a large building belonging to the Academy of St. Luke, we\r\nreach, on the right, the Quay of the Ripetta, a pretty architectural\r\nconstruction of Clement XI. in 1707.\r\n\r\nHence, a clumsy ferry-boat gives access to a walk which leads to St.\r\nPeter's (by Porta Angelica) through the fields at the back of S. Angelo.\r\nThese fields are of historic interest, being the _Prata Quinctia_ of\r\nCincinnatus.\r\n\r\n     \"L. Quinctius Cincinnatus, the only hope of the Roman people, lived\r\n     beyond the Tiber, opposite the place where the Navalia are, where\r\n     he cultivated the four acres of ground which are now called the\r\n     Quinctian meadows. There the messengers of the senate found him\r\n     leaning on his spade, either digging a trench or ploughing, but\r\n     certainly occupied in some field labour. The salutation, 'May it be\r\n     well with you and the republic,' was given and returned in the\r\n     usual form, and he was requested to put on his toga to receive a\r\n     message from the senate. Amazed, and asking if anything was wrong,\r\n     he desired his wife Racilia to fetch his toga from the cottage, and\r\n     having wiped off the sweat and dust with which he was covered, he\r\n     came forward dressed in his toga to the messengers, who saluted him\r\n     as dictator, and congratulated him.\"--_Livy_, iii. 26.\r\n\r\nThe churches on the left of the Ripetta are, first, _SS. Rocco e\r\nMartino_, built 1657, by Antonio de Rossi, with a hospital adjoining it.\r\n\r\n     \"The lying-in hospital adjoins the Church of San Rocco. It contains\r\n     seventy beds, furnished with curtains and screens, so as to\r\n     separate them effectually. Females are admitted without giving\r\n     their name, their country, or their condition in life; and such is\r\n     the delicacy observed in their regard, that they are at liberty to\r\n     wear a veil, so as to remain unknown even to their attendants, in\r\n     order to save the honour of their families, and prevent abortion,\r\n     suicide, or infanticide. Even should death ensue, the deceased\r\n     remains unknown. The children are conveyed to Santo Spirito; and\r\n     the mother who wishes to retain her offspring, affixes a\r\n     distinctive mark, by which it may be recognised and recovered. To\r\n     remove all disquietude from the minds of those who may enter, the\r\n     establishment is exempt from all civil, criminal, and\r\n     ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and its threshold is never crossed\r\n     except by persons connected with the establishment.\"--_Dr.\r\n     Donovan._\r\n\r\nThen, opposite the quay, _S. Girolamo degli Schiavoni_, built for Sixtus\r\nV. by Fontana. It contains, near the altar, a striking figure of St.\r\nJerome, seated, with a book upon his knees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe will now follow the Corso, which, in spite of its narrowness and bad\r\nside-pavements, is the finest street in Rome. It is greatly to be\r\nregretted that this street, which is nearly a mile long, should lead to\r\nnothing, instead of ending at the steps of the Capitol, which would have\r\nproduced a striking effect. It follows the line of the ancient Via\r\nFlaminia, and in consequence was once spanned by four triumphal\r\narches--of Marcus Aurelius, Domitian, Claudius, and Gordian--but all\r\nthese have disappeared. The Corso is perfectly lined with balconies,\r\nwhich, during the carnival, are filled with gay groups of maskers\r\nflinging confetti. These balconies are a relic of imperial times, having\r\nbeen invented at Rome, where they were originally called \"Mœniana,\"\r\nfrom the tribune Mœnius, who designed them to accommodate spectators\r\nof processions in the streets below.\r\n\r\n     \"The Corso is a street a mile long; a street of shops, and palaces,\r\n     and private houses, sometimes opening into a broad piazza. There\r\n     are verandahs and balconies, of all shapes and sizes, to almost\r\n     every house--not on one story alone, but often to one room or\r\n     another on every story--put there in general with so little order\r\n     or regularity, that if, year after year, and season after season,\r\n     it had rained balconies, hailed balconies, snowed balconies, blown\r\n     balconies, they could scarcely have come into existence in a more\r\n     disorderly manner.\"--_Dickens._\r\n\r\nOn the left of the Corso is the Augustine Church of _Gesù e Maria_, with\r\na façade by _Rinaldi_. Almost opposite, is the Church of _S. Giacomo\r\ndegli Incurabili_, by _Carlo Maderno_. It is attached to a surgical\r\nhospital for 350 patients. In the adjoining Strada S. Giacomo was the\r\nstudio of Canova, recognizable by fragments of bas-reliefs engrafted in\r\nits walls.\r\n\r\nThree streets beyond this (on right) is the _Via de' Pontefici_ (so\r\ncalled from a series of papal portraits, now destroyed, which formerly\r\nexisted on the walls of one of its houses), where (No. 57R) is the\r\nentrance to the remains of the _Mausoleum of Augustus_.\r\n\r\n     \"Hard by the banks of the Tiber, in the grassy meadows where the\r\n     Roman youths met in athletic and martial exercises, there rose a\r\n     lofty marble tower with three retiring stages, each of which had\r\n     its terrace covered with earth and planted with cypresses. These\r\n     stages were pierced with numerous chambers, destined to receive,\r\n     row within row, and story upon story, the remains of every member\r\n     of the imperial family, with many thousands of their slaves and\r\n     freedmen. In the centre of that massive mound the great founder of\r\n     the empire was to sleep his last sleep, while his statue was\r\n     ordained to rise conspicuous on its summit, and satiate its\r\n     everlasting gaze with the view of his beloved city.\"--_Merivale._\r\n\r\nThe first funeral here was that of Marcellus, son of Octavia, the sister\r\nof Augustus, and first husband of his daughter Julia, who died of\r\nmalaria at Baiæ, B.C. 23.\r\n\r\n    \"Quantos ille virûm magnam Mavortis ad urbem\r\n    Campus aget gemitus! vel quæ, Tiberine, videbis\r\n    Funera, cum tumulum præterlabere recentem!\r\n    Nec puer Iliacâ quisquam de gente Latinos\r\n    In tantum spe tollet avos; nec Romula quondam\r\n    Ullo se tantum tellus jactabit alumno.\r\n    Heu pietas, heu prisca fides, invictaque bello\r\n    Dextera! non illi se quisquam impune tulisset\r\n    Obvius armato, seu quum pedes iret in hostem,\r\n    Seu spumantis equi foderet calcaribus armos.\r\n    Heu, miserande puer! si qua fata aspera rumpas,\r\n    Tu Marcellus eris.\"\r\n\r\n    _Æneid_, vi. 873.\r\n\r\nThe next member of the family buried here was Agrippa, the second\r\nhusband of Julia, ob. 12 B.C. Then came Octavia, sister of the emperor\r\nand widow of Antony, honoured by a public funeral, at which orations\r\nwere delivered by Augustus himself, and Drusus, son of the empress\r\nLivia. Her body was carried to the tomb by Tiberius (afterwards\r\nemperor) and Drusus, the two sons of the empress. Drusus (B.C. 9) died\r\nin a German campaign by a fall from his horse, and was brought back\r\nhither for interment. In A.D. 14 the great Augustus died at Nola, and\r\nhis body was burnt here on a funeral pile so gigantic, that the widowed\r\nLivia, dishevelled and ungirt, with bare feet, attended by the principal\r\nRoman senators, had to watch it for five days and nights, before it\r\ncooled sufficiently for them to collect the ashes of the emperor. At the\r\nmoment of its being lighted an eagle was let loose from the summit of\r\nthe pyre, under which form a senator, named Numerius Atticus, was\r\ninduced, by a gift from Livia equivalent to 250,000 francs, to swear\r\nthat he saw the spirit of Augustus fly away to heaven. Then came\r\nGermanicus, son of the first Drusus, and nephew of Tiberius, ob. A.D.\r\n19, at Antioch, where he was believed to have been poisoned by Piso and\r\nhis wife Plancina. Then, in A.D. 23, Drusus, son of Tiberius, poisoned\r\nby his wife, Livilla, and her lover, Sejanus: then the empress, Livia,\r\nwho died A.D. 29, at the age of 86. Agrippina, widow of Germanicus (ob.\r\nA.D. 33), starved to death, and her two sons, Nero and Drusus, also\r\nmurdered by Tiberius, were long excluded from the family sepulchre, but\r\nwere eventually brought hither by the youngest brother Caius, afterwards\r\nthe emperor Caligula. Tiberius, who died A.D. 37, at the villa of\r\nLucullus at Misenum, was brought here for burial. The ashes of Caligula,\r\nmurdered A.D. 41, and first buried in the Horti Lamiani on the\r\nEsquiline, were transferred here by his sisters. In his reign, Antonia,\r\nthe widow of Drusus, and mother of Germanicus, had died, and her ashes\r\nwere laid up here. The Emperor Claudius, A.D. 54, murdered by Agrippina;\r\nhis son, Britannicus, A.D. 55, murdered by Nero; and the Emperor Nerva,\r\nA.D. 98, were the latest inmates of the mausoleum.\r\n\r\nThe last cremation which occurred here was long after the mausoleum had\r\nfallen into ruin, when the body of the tribune Rienzi, after having hung\r\nfor two days at S. Marcello, was ordered to be burnt here by Jugurta and\r\nSciaretta, and was consumed by a vast multitude of Jews (out of flattery\r\nto the Colonna, their neighbours at the Ghetto), \"in a fire of dry\r\nthistles, till it was reduced to ashes, and no fibre of it remained.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing now remaining to testify to the former magnificence of\r\nthis building. The area is used in summer as an open-air theatre, where\r\nvery amusing little plays are very well acted. Among its massive cells a\r\npoor washerwoman, known as \"Sister Rose,\" established, some ten years\r\nago, a kind of hospital for aged women (several of them centagenarians),\r\nwhom she supported entirely by her own exertions, having originally\r\nbegun by taking care of one old woman, and gradually adding another and\r\nanother. The English church service was first performed in Rome in the\r\nPalazzo Correa, adjoining this building.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Via de' Pontefici, the _Via Vittoria_ leaves the Corso. To\r\nthe Ursuline convent in this street (founded by Camilla Borghese in the\r\nseventeenth century) Madame Victoire and Madame Adelaide (\"tantes du\r\nRoi\") fled in the beginning of the great French revolution, and here\r\nthey died.\r\n\r\n_The Church of S. Carlo in Corso_ (on right) is the national church of\r\nthe Lombards. It is a handsome building with a fine dome. The interior\r\nwas commenced by _Lunghi_ in 1614, and finished by _Pietro da Cortona_.\r\nIt contains no objects of interest, unless a picture of the Apotheosis\r\nof S. Carlo Borromeo (the patron of the church), over the high altar, by\r\n_Carlo Maratta_, can be called so. The heart of the saint is preserved\r\nunder the altar.\r\n\r\nJust beyond this on the left, the _Via Condotti_--almost lined with\r\njewellers'-shops--branches off to the Piazza di Spagna. The Trinità de'\r\nMonti is seen beyond it. The opposite street, Via Fontanella, leads to\r\nSt. Peter's, and in five minutes to the magnificent--\r\n\r\n_Palazzo Borghese_, begun in 1590 by Cardinal Deza, from designs of\r\nMartino Lunghi, and finished by Paul V. (Camillo Borghese, 1605-21),\r\nfrom those of Flaminio Ponzio. The apartments inhabited by the family\r\nare handsome, but contain few objects of interest.\r\n\r\n     \"In the reign of Paul V. the Borghese became the wealthiest and\r\n     most powerful family in Rome. In the year 1612, the church\r\n     benefices already conferred upon Cardinal Scipione Borghese were\r\n     computed to secure him an income of 150,000 scudi. The temporal\r\n     offices were bestowed on Marc-Antonio Borghese, on whom the pope\r\n     also conferred the principality of Sulmona in Naples, besides\r\n     giving him rich palaces in Rome and the most beautiful villas in\r\n     the neighbourhood. He loaded his nephews with presents; we have a\r\n     list of them through his whole reign down to the year 1620. They\r\n     are sometimes jewels or vessels of silver, or magnificent\r\n     furniture, which was taken directly from the stores of the palace\r\n     and sent to the nephews; at other times carriages, rich arms, as\r\n     muskets and falconets, were presented to them; but the principal\r\n     thing was the round sums of hard money. These accounts make it\r\n     appear that to the year 1620, they had received in ready money\r\n     689,627 scudi, 31 baj; in luoghi di monte, 24,600 scudi, according\r\n     to their nominal value; in places, computing them at the sum their\r\n     sale would have brought to the treasury, 268,176 scudi; all which\r\n     amounted, as in the case of the Aldobrandini, to nearly a million.\r\n\r\n     \"Nor did the Borghese neglect to invest their wealth in real\r\n     property. They acquired eighty estates in the Campagna of Rome; the\r\n     Roman nobles suffering themselves to be tempted into the sale of\r\n     their ancient hereditary domain by the large prices paid them, and\r\n     by the high rate of interest borne by the luoghi di monte, which\r\n     they purchased with the money thus acquired. In many other parts of\r\n     the ecclesiastical states, the Borghese also seated themselves, the\r\n     pope facilitating their doing so by the grant of peculiar\r\n     privileges. In some places, for example, they received the right of\r\n     restoring exiles; in others, that of holding a market, or certain\r\n     exemptions were granted to those who became their vassals. They\r\n     were freed from various imposts, and even obtained a bull, by\r\n     virtue of which their possessions were never to be\r\n     confiscated.\"--_Ranke, Hist. of the Popes._\r\n\r\n     \"Si l'on peut reprocher à Paul, avec Muratori, ses libéralités\r\n     envers ses neveux, envers le cardinal Scipion, envers le duc de\r\n     Sulmone, il est juste d'ajouter que la plupart des membres de cette\r\n     noble famille rivalisèrent avec le pape de magnificence et de\r\n     générosité. Or, chaque année, Paul V. distribuait un million d'écus\r\n     d'or aux pélerins pauvres et un million et demi aux autres\r\n     nécessiteux. C'est à lui que remonte la fondation de la banque du\r\n     Saint-Esprit, dont les riches immeubles servirent d'hypothèques aux\r\n     dépôts qui lui furent confiés. Mais ce fut surtout dans les\r\n     constructions qu'il entreprit, que Paul V. déploya une royale\r\n     magnificence.\"--_Gournerie._\r\n\r\n     \"The Palazzo Borghese is an immense edifice standing round the four\r\n     sides of a quadrangle; and though the suite of rooms, comprising\r\n     the picture-gallery, forms an almost interminable vista, they\r\n     occupy only a part of the ground-floor of one side. We enter from\r\n     the street into a large court surrounded with a corridor, the\r\n     arches of which support a second series of arches above. The\r\n     picture-rooms open from one into another, and have many points of\r\n     magnificence, being large and lofty, with vaulted ceilings and\r\n     beautiful frescoes, generally of mythological subjects, in the flat\r\n     central parts of the vault. The cornices are gilded; the deep\r\n     embrasures of the windows are panelled with wood-work; the doorways\r\n     are of polished and variegated marble, or covered with a\r\n     composition as hard, and seemingly as durable. The whole has a kind\r\n     of splendid shabbiness thrown over it, like a slight coating of\r\n     rust; the furniture, at least the damask chairs, being a good deal\r\n     worn; though there are marble and mosaic tables which may serve to\r\n     adorn another palace, when this has crumbled away with\r\n     age.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\nThe Borghese Picture Gallery is the best private collection in Rome, and\r\nis open to the public daily from 9 to 2, except on Saturdays and\r\nSundays.

How deliciously they were\r\n     staggering about in the picture of Spring! A crowd of them were\r\n     sharpening arrows, whilst one of them turned round the great\r\n     grindstone, and two others, floating above, poured water upon it.\r\n     In Summer, they flew about among the tree-branches, which were\r\n     loaded with fruit, which they plucked; they swam in the fresh\r\n     water, and played with it. Autumn brought the pleasures of the\r\n     chase. Cupid sits, with a torch in his hand, in his little chariot,\r\n     which two of his companions draw; while Love beckons to the brisk\r\n     hunter, and shows him the place where they can rest themselves side\r\n     by side. Winter has lulled all the little ones to sleep; soundly\r\n     and fast they lie slumbering around. The Nymphs steal their quivers\r\n     and arrows, which they throw on the fire, that there may be an end\r\n     of the dangerous weapons.\"--_Andersen, in The Improvisatore._\r\n\r\n    15.

'Sacred and Profane Love': _Titian_.*\r\n\r\n     \"Out of Venice there is nothing of Titian's to compare to his\r\n     Sacred and Profane Love. It represents two figures: one, a heavenly\r\n     and youthful form, unclothed, except with a light drapery; the\r\n     other, a lovely female, dressed in the most splendid attire; both\r\n     are sitting on the brink of a well, into which a little winged Love\r\n     is groping, apparently to find his lost dart.... Description can\r\n     give no idea of the consummate beauty of this composition. It has\r\n     all Titian's matchless warmth of colouring, with a correctness of\r\n     design no other painter of the Venetian school ever attained. It\r\n     is nature, but not individual nature: it is ideal beauty in all its\r\n     perfection, and breathing life in all its truth, that we\r\n     behold.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"Two female forms are seated on the edge of a sarcophagus-shaped\r\n     fountain, the one in a rich Venetian costume, with gloves, flowers\r\n     in her hands, and a plucked rose beside her, is in deep meditation,\r\n     as if solving some difficult question. The other is unclothed; a\r\n     red drapery is falling behind her, while she exhibits a form of the\r\n     utmost beauty and delicacy; she is turning towards the other figure\r\n     with the sweetest persuasiveness of expression. A Cupid is playing\r\n     in the fountain; in the distance is a rich, glowing\r\n     landscape.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n    30. Madonna: _Giov. Bellini_.\r\n    34.

Venus and Cupid: _Lucas Cranach_.\r\n\r\nThe _Palazzetto Borghese_ on the opposite side of the piazza, originally\r\nintended as a dower-house for the family, is now let in apartments. It\r\nis this house which is described as the \"Palazzo Clementi,\" in\r\n_Mademoiselle Mori_.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Via Fontanella and the Corso is the handsome\r\n_Palazzo Ruspoli_, built by Ammanati in 1586. It has a grand white\r\nmarble staircase erected by Lunghi in 1750. Beyond this are the palaces\r\n_Fiano_, _Verospi_, and _Teodoli_.\r\n\r\n     \"Les palais de Rome, bien que n'ayant pas un caractère original\r\n     comme ceux de Florence ou de Venise n'en sont pas moins cependant\r\n     un des traits de la ville des papes. Ils n'appartiennent ni au\r\n     moyen age, ni à la renaissance (la Palais de Venise seul rappelle\r\n     les constructions massives de Florence); ils sont des modèles\r\n     d'architecture civile moderne. Les Bramante, les Sangallo, les\r\n     Balthazar Peruzzi, qui les ont batis, sont des maîtres qu'on ne se\r\n     lasse pas d'étudier. La magnificence de ces palais reside\r\n     principalement dans leur architecture et dans les collections\r\n     artistiques que quelques-uns contiennent. Un certain nombre sont\r\n     malheureusement dans un triste état d'abandon. De plus, à\r\n     l'exception d'un très petit nombre, ils sont restés inachevés. Cela\r\n     se conçoit; presque tous sont le produit du luxe célibataire des\r\n     papes ou des cardinaux; très-peu de ces personages ont pu voir la\r\n     fin de ce qu'ils avaient commencé. Leurs heritiers, pour le\r\n     plupart, se souciaient fort peu de jeter les richesses qu'ils\r\n     venaient d'acquerir dans les édifices de luxe et de vanité. A\r\n     l'intérieur, le plus souvent, est un mobilier rare, suranné, et\r\n     mesquin.\"--_A. Du Pays._[7]\r\n\r\nThe _Palazzo Bernini_ (151 Corso), on the left, has, inside its\r\nentrance, a curious statue of \"Calumny\" by _Bernini_, with an\r\ninscription relative to his own sufferings from slander.\r\n\r\nOn the right, the small piazza of S. Lorenzo opens out of the Corso.\r\nHere is the _Church of S. Lorenzo in Lucina_, founded in the fifth\r\ncentury, but rebuilt in its present form by Paul V. in 1606. The\r\ncampanile is of an older date, and so are the lions in the portico.\r\n\r\n     \"When the lion, or other wild beast, appears in the act of preying\r\n     on a smaller animal or on a man, is implied the severity of the\r\n     Church towards the impenitent or heretical; but when in the act of\r\n     sporting with another creature, her benignity towards the neophyte\r\n     and the docile. At the portal of St Lorenzo in Lucina, this idea is\r\n     carried out in the figure of a mannikin affectionately stroking the\r\n     head of the terrible creature who protects, instead of devouring\r\n     him.\"--_Hemans' Christian Art._\r\n\r\nNo one should omit seeing the grand picture of _Guido Reni_, over the\r\nhigh altar of this church,--the Crucifixion, seen against a wild, stormy\r\nsky. Niccolas Poussin, ob. 1660, is buried here, and one of his best\r\nknown Arcadian landscapes is reproduced in a bas-relief upon his tomb,\r\nwhich was erected by Chateaubriand, with the epitaph,--\r\n\r\n    \"Parce piis lacrymis, vivit Pussinus in urnâ,\r\n      Vivus qui dederat, nescius ipse mori.\r\n    Hîc tamen ipse silet; si vis audire loquentem,\r\n      Mirum est, in tabulis vivit, et eloquitur.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn \"The Ring and the Book\" of Browning, this church is the scene of\r\nPompilia's baptism and marriage. She is made to say:--\r\n\r\n           --\"This St. Lorenzo seems\r\n    My own particular place, I always say.\r\n    I used to wonder, when I stood scarce high\r\n    As the bed here, what the marble lion meant,\r\n    Eating the figure of a prostrate man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the bodies of her parents are represented as being exposed after\r\nthe murder:\r\n\r\n           --\"beneath the piece\r\n    Of Master Guido Reni, Christ on Cross,\r\n    Second to nought observable in Rome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the left, where the Via della Vite turns out of the Corso, an\r\ninscription in the wall records the destruction, in 1665, of the\r\ntriumphal arch of Marcus Aurelius, which existed here till that time.\r\nThe magnificence of this arch is attested by the bas-reliefs\r\nrepresenting the history of the emperor, which were removed from it, and\r\nare preserved on the staircase of the palace of the Conservators.\r\n\r\n     \"Les Barbares n'en savaient pas assez et n'avaient pas assez de\r\n     patience pour démolir les monuments romains; mais, avec les\r\n     ressources de la science moderne et à la suite d'une administration\r\n     régulière, on est venu à bout de presque tout ce que le temps avait\r\n     épargné. Il y'avait, par exemple, au commencement du XVIe.\r\n     siècle, quatre arcs de triomphe qui n'existent plus; le dernier,\r\n     celui de Marc Aurele, a été enlevé par le pape Alexandre VII. On\r\n     lit encore dans le Corso l'inconcevable inscription dans laquelle\r\n     le pape se vante d'avoir debarrassé la promenade publique de ce\r\n     monument, qui, vu sa date, devait être d'un beau style.\"--_Ampère,\r\n     Voyage Dantesque._\r\n\r\nA little further down the Corso, on the left, the Via delle Convertite\r\nleads to _S. Sylvestro in Capite_, one of three churches in Rome\r\ndedicated to the sainted pope of the time of Constantine. This, like S.\r\nLorenzo, has a fine mediæval campanile. The day of St. Sylvester's\r\ndeath, December 31 (A.D. 335), is kept here with great solemnity, and is\r\ncelebrated by magnificent musical services. This pope was buried in the\r\ncemetery of Priscilla, whence his remains were removed to S. Martino al\r\nMonte. The title \"In Capite\" is given to this church on account of the\r\nhead of St John Baptist, which it professes to possess, as is narrated\r\nby an inscription engrafted into its walls.\r\n\r\nThe convent attached to this church was founded in 1318, especially for\r\nnoble sisters of the house of Colonna who dedicated themselves to God.\r\nHere it was that the celebrated Vittoria Colonna, Marchesa di Pescara,\r\ncame to reside in 1525, when widowed in her thirty-sixth year, and here\r\nshe began to write her sonnets, a kind of \"In Memoriam,\" to her husband.\r\nIt is a curious proof of the value placed upon her remaining in the\r\nworld, that Pope Clement VII. was persuaded to send a brief to the\r\nabbess and nuns, desiring them to offer her \"all spiritual and temporal\r\nconsolations,\" but forbidding them, under pain of the greater\r\nexcommunication, to permit her to take the veil in her affliction.[8]\r\n\r\nAt the end of this street, continued under the name of Via de Mercede\r\n(No. 11 was the residence of Bernini), and behind the Propaganda, is the\r\n_Church of S. Andrea delle Fratte_, whose brick cupola by Borromini is\r\nso picturesque a feature. The bell-tower beside it swings when the bells\r\nare rung. In the second chapel on the right is the beautiful modern tomb\r\nof Mademoiselle Julie Falconnet, by Miss Hosmer. The opposite chapel is\r\nremarkable for a modern miracle (?) annually commemorated here.\r\n\r\n     \"M. Ratisbonne, un juif, appartenant à une très-riche famille\r\n     d'Alsace, qui se trouvait accidentellement à Rome, se promenant\r\n     dans l'église de S. Andrea delle Fratte pendant qu'on y faisait les\r\n     préparatifs pour les obsèques de M. de la Ferronays, s'y est\r\n     converti subitement. Il se trouvait debout en face d'une chapelle\r\n     dédiée à l'ange gardien, à quelques pas, lorsque tout-à-coup il a\r\n     eu une apparition lumineuse de la Sainte Vierge qui lui a fait\r\n     signe d'aller vers cette chapelle. Une force irrésistible l'y a\r\n     entraíné, il y est tombé à genoux, et il a été à l'instant\r\n     chrétien. Sa première parole à celui qui l'avait accompagné a été,\r\n     en relevant son visage inondé de larmes: 'Il faut que ce monsieur\r\n     ait beaucoup prié pour moi.'\"--_Récit d'une Sœur._\r\n\r\n     \"Era un istante ch'io mi stava in chiesa allora che di colpo mi\r\n     sentii preso da inesprimibile conturbamento. Alzai gli occhi; tutto\r\n     l'edifizio s'era dileguato a' miei sguardi; sola una cappella aveva\r\n     come in se raccolta tutta la luce, e di mezzo di raggianti\r\n     splendori s' è mostrata diritta sull'altare, grande,\r\n     sfolgoreggiante, piena di maestà, e di dolcezza, la Vergine Maria.\r\n     Una forza irresistibile m'ha sospinto verso di lei. La Vergine m'ha\r\n     fatto della mano segno d'inginocchiarmi; pareva volermi dire,\r\n     'Bene!' Ella non mi ha parlato ma io ho inteso tutto.\"--_Recital of\r\n     Alfonse Ratisbonne._[9]\r\n\r\nM. de la Ferronays, whose character is now so well known from the\r\nbeautiful family memoirs of Mrs. Augustus Craven, is buried beneath the\r\naltar where this vision occurred. In the third chapel on the left is the\r\ntomb of Angelica Kauffmann; in the right aisle that of the Prussian\r\nartist, Schadow. The two angels in front of the choir are by _Bernini_,\r\nwho intended them for the bridge of S. Angelo.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Corso, the Via S. Claudio (left) leads to the pretty\r\nlittle church of that name, adjoining the Palazzo Parisani. Behind, is\r\nthe Church of Sta. Maria in Via.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the Piazza Colonna is the _Palazzo Chigi_, begun in\r\n1526 by Giacomo della Porta, and finished by Carlo Maderno. It contains\r\nseveral good pictures and a fine library, but is seldom shown.[10]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable members of the great family of Chigi have been the\r\nfamous banker Agostino Chigi, who lived so sumptuously at the Farnesina\r\n(see chap. 20), and Fabio Chigi, who mounted the papal throne as\r\nAlexander VII., and who long refused to have anything to do with the\r\naggrandisement of his family, saying that the poor were the only\r\nrelations he would acknowledge, and, like Christ, he did not wish for\r\nany nearer ones. To keep himself in mind of the shortness of earthly\r\ngrandeur, this pope always kept a coffin in his room, and drank out of a\r\ncup shaped like a skull.\r\n\r\nThe side of the _Piazza Colonna_, which faces the Corso, is occupied by\r\nthe Post-Office. On its other sides are the Piombino and Ferrajuoli\r\npalaces, of no interest. In the centre is placed the fine _Column_,\r\nwhich was found on the Monte Citorio in 1709, having been originally\r\nerected by the senate and people A.D. 174, to the Emperor Marcus\r\nAurelius Antoninus (adopted son of the Emperor Hadrian,--husband of his\r\nniece, Annia Faustina,--father of the Emperor Commodus). It is\r\nsurrounded by bas-reliefs, representing the conquest of the Marcomanni.\r\nOne of these has long been an especial object of interest, from being\r\nsupposed to represent a divinity (Jupiter?) sending rain to the troops,\r\nin answer to the prayers of a Christian legion from Mitylene. Eusebius\r\ngives the story, stating that the piety of these Christians induced the\r\nemperor to ask their prayers in his necessity, and a letter in Justin\r\nMartyr (of which the authenticity is much doubted), in which Aurelius\r\nallows the fact, is produced in proof. The statue of St. Paul on the\r\ntop of the column was erected by Sixtus V.; the pedestal also is modern.\r\n\r\nBehind the Piazza Colonna is the _Piazza Monte Citorio_, containing an\r\n_Obelisk_ which was discovered in broken fragments near the Church of S.\r\nLorenzo in Lucina. It was repaired with pieces of the column of\r\nAntoninus Pius, the pedestal of which may still be seen in the Vatican\r\ngarden. Its hieroglyphics are very perfect and valuable, and show that\r\nit was erected more than 600 years before Christ, in honour of\r\nPsammeticus I. It was brought from Heliopolis by Augustus, and erected\r\nby him in the Campus Martius, where it received the name of Obeliscus\r\nSolaris, from being made to act as a sun-dial.\r\n\r\n     \"Ei, qui est in campo, divus Augustus addidit mirabilem usum ad\r\n     deprehendendas solis umbras, dierumque ac noctium ita magnitudines,\r\n     strato lapide ad magnitudinem obelisci, cui par fieret umbra, brumæ\r\n     confectæ die, sexta hora; paulatimque per regulas (quæ sunt ex die\r\n     exclusæ) singulis diebus decresceret ac rursus augesceret: digna\r\n     cognitu res et ingenio fœcundo. Manilius mathematicus apici\r\n     auratam pilam addidit, cujus umbra vertice colligeretur in se ipsa\r\n     alias enormiter jaculante apice ratione (ut ferunt) a capite\r\n     hominis intellecta. Hæc observatio triginta jam ferè annos non\r\n     congruit, sive solis ipsius dissono cursu, et cœli aliqua\r\n     ratione mutato, sive universa tellure a centra suo aliquid emota ut\r\n     deprehendi et in aliis locis accipio: sive urbis tremoribus ibi\r\n     tantum gnomone intorto, sive inundationibus Tiberis sedimento molis\r\n     facto: quanquam ad altitudinem impositi oneris in terram quoque\r\n     dicantur acta fundamenta.\"--_Plin. Nat. Hist._ lib. xxxiv. 14.\r\n\r\n_The Palace of the Monte Citorio_ (designed by Bernini) contains public\r\noffices connected with police, passports, &c. On the opposite side of\r\nthe piazza are the Railway and Telegraph Offices.\r\n\r\nProceeding up the Corso, the Via di Pietra (right) leads into the small\r\nPiazza di Pietra, one side of which is occupied by the eleven remaining\r\ncolumns of the _Temple of Neptune_, built up by Innocent XII. into the\r\nwalls of the modern Custom-house. It is worth while to enter the\r\ncourtyard in order to look back and observe the immense masses of stone\r\nabove the entrance, part of the ancient temple,--which are here\r\nuncovered.\r\n\r\nClose to this, behind the Palazzo Cini, in the Piazza Orfanelli, is the\r\n_Teatro Capranica_, occupying part of a palace of _c._ 1350, with gothic\r\nwindows. The opposite church, _Sta. Maria in Aquiro_, recalls by its\r\nname the column of the Equiria, celebrated in ancient annals as the\r\nplace where certain games and horse-races, instituted by Romulus, were\r\ncelebrated. Ovid describes them in his Fasti. The church was founded\r\n_c._ 400, but was re-built under Francesco da Volterra in 1590.\r\n\r\nA small increase of width in the Corso is now dignified by the name of\r\nthe _Piazza Sciarra_. The street which turns off hence, under an arch\r\n(Via de Muratte, on the left), leads to the _Fountain of Trevi_, erected\r\nin 1735 by Niccolo Salvi for Clement XII. The statue of Neptune is by\r\nPietro Bracci.\r\n\r\n     \"The fountain of Trevi draws its precious water from a source far\r\n     beyond the walls, whence it flows hitherward through old\r\n     subterranean aqueducts, and sparkles forth as pure as the virgin\r\n     who first led Agrippa to its well-springs by her father's door. In\r\n     the design of the fountain, some sculptor of Bernini's school has\r\n     gone absolutely mad, in marble. It is a great palace-front, with\r\n     niches and many bas-reliefs, out of which looks Agrippa's legendary\r\n     virgin, and several of the allegoric sisterhood; while at the base\r\n     appears Neptune with his floundering steeds and tritons blowing\r\n     their horns about him, and twenty other artificial fantasies, which\r\n     the calm moonlight soothes into better taste than is native to\r\n     them. And, after all, it is as magnificent a piece of work as ever\r\n     human skill contrived. At the foot of the palatial façade, is\r\n     strown, with careful art and ordered regularity, a broad and broken\r\n     heap of massive rock, looking as if it may have lain there since\r\n     the deluge. Over a central precipice falls the water, in a\r\n     semicircular cascade; and from a hundred crevices, on all sides,\r\n     snowy jets gush up, and streams spout out of the mouths and\r\n     nostrils of stone monsters, and fall in glistening drops; while\r\n     other rivulets, that have run wild, come leaping from one rude step\r\n     to another, over stones that are mossy, shining and green with\r\n     sedge, because, in a century of their wild play, nature has adopted\r\n     the fountain of Trevi, with all its elaborate devices, for her own.\r\n     Finally the water, tumbling, sparkling, and dashing with joyous\r\n     haste and never ceasing murmur, pours itself into a great marble\r\n     basin and reservoir, and fills it with a quivering tide; on which\r\n     is seen, continually, a snowy semi-circle of momentary foam from\r\n     the principal cascade, as well as a multitude of snow-points from\r\n     smaller jets. The basin, occupies the whole breadth of the piazza,\r\n     whence flights of steps descend to its border. A boat might float,\r\n     and make mimic voyages, on this artificial lake.\r\n\r\n     \"In the daytime there is hardly a livelier scene in Rome than the\r\n     neighbourhood of the fountain of Trevi; for the piazza is then\r\n     filled with stalls of vegetable and fruit dealers,\r\n     chestnut-roasters, cigar-vendors, and other people whose petty and\r\n     wandering traffic is transacted in the open air. It is likewise\r\n     thronged with idlers, lounging over the iron railing, and with\r\n     _forestieri_, who come hither to see the famous fountain. Here,\r\n     also, are men with buckets, urchins with cans, and maidens (a\r\n     picture as old as the patriarchal times) bearing their pitchers\r\n     upon their heads. For the water of Trevi is in request, far and\r\n     wide, as the most refreshing draught for feverish lips, the\r\n     pleasantest to mingle with wine, and the wholesomest to drink in\r\n     its native purity, that can anywhere be found. But, at midnight,\r\n     the piazza is a solitude; and it is a delight to behold this\r\n     untameable water, sporting by itself in the moonshine, and\r\n     compelling all the elaborate trivialities of art to assume a\r\n     natural aspect, in accordance with its own powerful simplicity.\r\n     Tradition goes, that a parting draught at the fountain of Trevi\r\n     ensures a traveller's return to Rome, whatever obstacles and\r\n     improbabilities may seem to beset him.\"--_Hawthorne's\r\n     Transformation_.\r\n\r\n     \"Le bas-relief, placé au-dessus de cette fontaine, représente la\r\n     jeune fille indiquant la source précieuse, comme dans l'antiquité\r\n     une peinture représentait le même évènement dans une chapelle\r\n     construite au lieu où il s'était passé.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ i. 264.\r\n\r\nIn this piazza is the rather handsome front of _Sta. Maria in Trivia_,\r\nformerly Sta. Maria in Fornica, erected by Cardinal Mazarin, on the site\r\nof an older church built by Belisarius--as is told by an inscription:--\r\n\r\n    \"Hanc vir patricius Belisarius urbis amicus\r\n      Ob culpæ veniam condidit ecclesiam.\r\n    Hanc, idcirco, pedem qui sacram ponis in ædem\r\n      Ut miseretur eum sæpe precare Deum.\"\r\n\r\nThe fault which Belisarius wished to expiate, was the exile of Pope\r\nSylverius (A.D. 536), who was starved to death in the island of Ponza.\r\nThe crypt of the present building, being the parish church of the\r\nQuirinal, contains the entrails of twenty popes (removed for\r\nembalmment)--from Sixtus V. to Pius VIII.--who died in the Quirinal\r\nPalace!\r\n\r\nThe little church near the opposite corner of the piazza is that of _The\r\nCrociferi_, and is still (1870) served by the Venerable Don Giovanni\r\nMerlini, Father General of the Order of the Precious Blood, and the\r\npersonal friend of its founder, Gaspare del Buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe Fountain of Trevi occupies one end of the gigantic _Palazzo Poli_,\r\nwhich contains the English consulate. At the other end is the shop of\r\nthe famous jeweller, Castellani, well worth visiting, for the sake of\r\nits beautiful collection of Etruscan designs, both in jewellery and in\r\nlarger works of art.\r\n\r\n     \"Castellani est l'homme qui a ressuscité la bijouterie romaine. Son\r\n     escalier, tapissé d'inscriptions et de bas-reliefs antiques, fait\r\n     croire que nous entrons dans un musée. Un jeune marchand aussi\r\n     érudit que les archéologues fait voir une collection de bijoux\r\n     anciens de toutes les époques, depuis les origines de l'Etrurie\r\n     jusqu'au siècle de Constantin. C'est la source où Castellani puise\r\n     les éléments d'un art nouveau qui détrônera avant dix ans la\r\n     pacotille du Palais-Royal.\"--_About_, _Rome Contemporaine_.\r\n\r\n     \"C'est en s'inspirant des parures retrouvées dans les tombes de\r\n     l'Etrurie, des bracelets et des colliers dont se paraient les\r\n     femmes étrusques et sabines, que M. Castellani, guidé par le goût\r\n     savant et ingénieux d'un homme qui porte dignement l'ancien nom de\r\n     Caetani, a introduit dans la bijouterie un style à la fois\r\n     classique et nouveau. Parmi les artistes les plus originaux de Rome\r\n     sont certainement les orfèvres Castellani et D. Miguele Caetani,\r\n     duc de Sermoneta.\"--_Ampère_, _Hist. Rom._ i. 388.\r\n\r\nThe _Palazzo Sciarra_ (on left of the Corso), built in 1603 by Labacco,\r\ncontains a gallery of pictures. Its six celebrated gems are marked with\r\nan asterisk.

The Vestal Claudia drawing a boat with the statue of Ceres up\r\n          the Tiber: _Garofalo_.\r\n    29. Tavern Scene: _Teniers_.\r\n    33. The Fornarina: _Copy of Raphael by Giulio Romano_.\r\n    36. Holy Family with Angels: _Lucas Cranach_, 1504.\r\n\r\n    _4th Room._--\r\n\r\n    1. Holy Family: _Fra Bartolomeo_.*\r\n\r\n     \"The glow and freshness of colouring in this admirable painting,\r\n     the softness of the skin, the beauty and sweetness of the\r\n     expression, the look with which the mother's eyes are bent upon\r\n     the baby she holds in her arms, and the innocent fondness with\r\n     which the other child gazes up in her face, are worthy of the\r\n     painter whose works Raphael delighted to study, and from which, in\r\n     a great measure, he formed his principles of colouring.\"--_Eaton's\r\n     Rome_.\r\n\r\n    5. St. John the Evangelist: _Guercino_.\r\n    6. The Violin Player (Andrea Marone?): _Raphael_.*\r\n\r\n     \"The Violin Player is a youth holding the bow of a violin and a\r\n     laurel wreath in his hand, and looking at the spectators over his\r\n     shoulder. The expression of his countenance is sensible and\r\n     decided, and betokens a character alive to the impressions of\r\n     sense, yet severe. The execution is excellent,--inscribed with the\r\n     date 1518.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     7. St. Mark: _Guercino_.\r\n     8. Daughter of Herodias: _Guercino_.\r\n    12. Conjugal Love: _Agostino Caracci_.\r\n    16. The Gamblers: _Caravaggio_.*\r\n\r\n     \"This is a masterpiece of the painter. A sharper is playing at\r\n     cards with a youth of family and fortune, whom his confederate,\r\n     while pretending to be looking on, is assisting to cheat. The\r\n     subject will remind you of the Flemish School, but this painting\r\n     bears no resemblance to it. Here is no farce, no caricature.\r\n     Character was never more strongly marked, nor a tale more\r\n     inimitably told. It is life itself, and you almost forget it is a\r\n     picture, and expect to see the game go on. The colouring is beyond\r\n     all praise.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n    17. Modesty and Vanity: _Leonardo da Vinci_.*\r\n\r\n     \"One of Leonardo's most beautiful pictures is in Rome, in the\r\n     Sciarra Palace--two female half-figures of Modesty and Vanity. The\r\n     former, with a veil over her head, is a particularly pleasing,\r\n     noble profile, with a clear, open expression; she beckons to her\r\n     sister, who stands fronting the spectator, beautifully arrayed, and\r\n     with a sweet seducing smile. This picture is remarkably powerful in\r\n     colouring, and wonderfully finished, but unfortunately has become\r\n     rather dark in the shadows.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n    19. Magdalen: _Guido Reni_.\r\n    24. Family Portrait: _Titian_.\r\n    25. Portrait: _Bronzino_.\r\n    26. St. Sebastian: _Perugino_.\r\n    29. Bella Donna: _Titian_.*\r\n\r\n     Sometimes supposed to represent Donna Laura Eustachio, the peasant\r\n     Duchess of Alphonso I. of Ferrara.\r\n\r\n     \"When Titian or Tintoret look at a human being, they see at a\r\n     glance the whole of its nature, outside and in; all that it has of\r\n     form, of colour, of passion, or of thought; saintliness and\r\n     loveliness; fleshly power, and spiritual power; grace, or strength,\r\n     or softness, or whatsoever other quality, those men will see to the\r\n     full, and so paint, that, when narrower people come to look at what\r\n     they have done, every one may, if he chooses, find his own special\r\n     pleasure in the work. The sensualist will find sensuality in\r\n     Titian; the thinker will find thought; the saint, sanctity; the\r\n     colourist, colour; the anatomist, form; and yet the picture will\r\n     never be a popular one in the full sense, for none of these\r\n     narrower people will find their special taste so alone consulted,\r\n     as that the qualities which would ensure their gratification shall\r\n     be sifted or separated from others; they are checked by the\r\n     presence of the other qualities, which ensure the gratification of\r\n     other men.... Only there is a strange undercurrent of everlasting\r\n     murmur about the name of Titian, which means the deep consent of\r\n     all great men that he is greater than they.\"--_Ruskin's Two Paths,\r\n     Lect. 2._\r\n\r\n    31. Death of the Virgin: _Albert Durer_.\r\n    32. Maddalena della Radice: _Guido Reni_.*\r\n\r\n     \"The two Magdalens by Guido are almost duplicates, and yet one is\r\n     incomparably superior to the other. She is reclining on a rock, and\r\n     her tearful and uplifted eyes, the whole of her countenance and\r\n     attitude, speak the overwhelming sorrow that penetrates her soul.\r\n     Her face might charm the heart of a stoic; and the contrast of her\r\n     youth and enchanting loveliness, with the abandonment of grief, the\r\n     resignation of all earthly hope, and the entire devotion of herself\r\n     to penitence and heaven, is most affecting.\"--_Eaton's Rome._[11]\r\n\r\nNear the Piazza Sciarra, the Corso (as Via Flaminia) was formerly\r\nspanned by the Arch of Claudius, removed in 1527. Some reliefs from this\r\narch are preserved in the portico of the Villa Borghese, and though much\r\nmutilated are of fine workmanship. The inscription, which commemorated\r\nthe erection of the arch in honour of the conquest of Britain, is\r\npreserved in the courtyard of the Barberini Palace.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the Piazza Sciarra is the Via della Caravita, containing\r\nthe small but popular _Church of the Caravita_,[12] used for the\r\npeculiar religious exercises of the Jesuits, especially for their\r\nterrible Lenten \"flagellation\" services, which are one of the most\r\nextraordinary sights afforded by Catholic Rome.\r\n\r\n     \"The ceremony of pious whippings, one of the penances of the\r\n     convents, still takes place at the time of vespers in the oratory\r\n     of the Padre Caravita and in another church in Rome. It is preceded\r\n     by a short exhortation, during which a bell rings, and whips, that\r\n     is, strings of knotted whipcord, are distributed quietly amongst\r\n     such of the audience as are on their knees in the nave. On a second\r\n     bell, the candles are extinguished--a loud voice issues from the\r\n     altar, which pours forth an exhortation to think of unconfessed, or\r\n     unrepented, or unforgiven crimes. This continues a sufficient time\r\n     to allow the kneelers to strip off their upper garments; the tone\r\n     of the preacher is raised more loudly at each word, and he\r\n     vehemently exhorts his hearers to recollect that Christ and the\r\n     martyrs suffered much more than whipping. 'Show, then, your\r\n     penitence--show your sense of Christ's sacrifice--show it with the\r\n     whip.' The flagellation begins. The darkness, the tumultuous sound\r\n     of blows in every direction--'Blessed Virgin Mary, pray for us!'\r\n     bursting out at intervals,--the persuasion that you are surrounded\r\n     by atrocious culprits and maniacs, who know of an absolution for\r\n     every crime--so far from exciting a smile, fixes you to the spot in\r\n     a trance of restless horror, prolonged beyond bearing. The\r\n     scourging continues ten or fifteen minutes.\"--_Lord Broughton._\r\n\r\n     \"Each man on entering the church was supplied with a scourge. After\r\n     a short interval the doors were barred, the lights extinguished;\r\n     and from praying, the congregation proceeded to groaning, crying,\r\n     and finally, being worked up into a kind of ecstatic fury, applied\r\n     the scourge to their uncovered shoulders without\r\n     mercy.\"--_Whiteside's Italy in the Nineteenth Century._\r\n\r\nBeyond the Caravita is the _Church of S. Ignazio_, built by Cardinal\r\nLudovisi. The façade, of 1685, is by Algardi. It contains the tomb of\r\nGregory XIV. (Nicolo Sfondrati, 1590--91), and that of S. Ludovico\r\nGonzaga, both sculptured by _Le Gros_.\r\n\r\n     \"In S. Ignazio is the chapel of San Luigi Gonzaga, on whom not a\r\n     few of the young Roman damsels look with something of the same kind\r\n     of admiration as did Clytie on Apollo, whom he and St. Sebastian,\r\n     those two young, beautiful, graceful saints, very fairly represent\r\n     in Christian mythology. His festa falls in June, and then his altar\r\n     is embosomed in flowers, arranged with exquisite taste; and a pile\r\n     of letters may be seen at its foot, written to the saint by young\r\n     men and maidens, and directed to Paradiso. They are supposed to be\r\n     burnt unread, except by San Luigi, who must find singular petitions\r\n     in these pretty little missives, tied up now with a green ribbon,\r\n     expressive of hope, now with a red one, emblematic of love, or\r\n     whatever other significant colour the writer may\r\n     prefer.\"--_Mademoiselle Mori._\r\n\r\nThe frescoes on the roof and tribune are by the Padre Pozzi.\r\n\r\n     \"Amid the many distinguished men whom the Jesuits sent forth to\r\n     every region of the world, I cannot recollect the name of a single\r\n     artist unless it be the Father Pozzi, renowned for his skill in\r\n     perspective, and who used his skill less as an artist than a\r\n     conjuror, to produce such illusions as make the vulgar stare; to\r\n     make the impalpable to the grasp appear as palpable to the vision;\r\n     the near seem distant, the distant near; the unreal, real; to cheat\r\n     the eye; to dazzle the sense;--all this has Father Pozzi most\r\n     cunningly achieved in the Gesù and the Sant' Ignazio at Rome; but\r\n     nothing more, and nothing better than this. I wearied of his\r\n     altar-pieces and of his wonderful roofs which pretend to be no\r\n     roofs at all. Scheme, tricks, and deceptions in art should all be\r\n     kept for the theatre. It appeared to me nothing less than profane\r\n     to introduce _shams_ into the temples of God.\"--_Mrs. Jameson._\r\n\r\nOn the left of the Corso--opposite the handsome Palazzo Simonetti--is\r\nthe _Church of S. Marcello_ (Pope, 308--10), containing some interesting\r\nmodern monuments. Among them are those of Pierre Gilles, the traveller\r\n(ob. 1555), and of the English Cardinal Weld. Here, also, Cardinal\r\nGonsalvi, the famous and liberal minister of Pius VII., is buried in\r\nthe same tomb with his beloved younger brother, the Marchese Andrea\r\nGonsalvi. Their monument, by Rinaldi, tells that here repose the bodies\r\nof two brothers--\r\n\r\n    \"Qui cum singulari amore dum vivebant\r\n          Se mutuo dilexissent\r\n            Corpora etiam sua\r\n    Una eademque urna condi voluere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the masterpieces which made the reputation of Pierino del Vaga\r\n(1501--1547). In the chapel of the Virgin are the cherubs, whose\r\ngraceful movements and exquisite flesh-tints Vasari declares to have\r\nbeen unsurpassed by any artist in fresco. In the chapel of the Crucifix\r\nis the Creation of Eve, which is even more beautiful.\r\n\r\n     \"The perfectly beautiful figure of the naked Adam is seen lying,\r\n     overpowered by sleep, while Eve, filled with life, and with folded\r\n     hands, rises to receive the blessing of her Maker,--a most grand\r\n     and solemn figure standing erect in heavy drapery.\"--_Vasari_, iv.\r\n\r\nThis church is said to occupy the site of a house of the Christian\r\nmatron Lucina, in which Marcellus died of wounds incurred in attempting\r\nto settle a quarrel among his Christian followers. It was in front of it\r\nthat the body of the tribune Rienzi, after his murder on the Capitol\r\nsteps, was hung up by the feet for two days as a mark for the rabble to\r\nthrow stones at.\r\n\r\nThe next street to the right leads to the _Collegio Romano_, founded by\r\nSt. Francis Borgia, Duke of Gandia (a descendant of Pope Alexander VI.),\r\nwho, after a youth spent amid the splendours of the court of Madrid,\r\nretired to Rome in 1550, in the time of Julius III., and became the\r\nsuccessor of Ignatius Loyola as general of the Jesuits. The buildings\r\nwere erected, as we now see them, by Ammanati, in 1582, for Gregory\r\nXIII. The college is entirely under the superintendence of the Jesuits.\r\nThe library is large and valuable. The _Kircherian Museum_ (shown to\r\ngentlemen from ten to eleven on Sundays) is worth visiting. It contains\r\na number of antiquities, illustrative of Roman and Etruscan customs, and\r\nmany beautiful ancient bronzes and vases. The most important object is\r\nthe \"Cista Mistica,\" a bronze vase and cover, which was given as a prize\r\nto successful gladiators, and which was originally fitted up with\r\neverything useful for their profession.\r\n\r\nThe _Observatory_ of the Collegio Romano has obtained a European\r\nreputation from the important astronomical researches of its director,\r\nthe Padre Secchi.\r\n\r\nThe Collegio Romano has produced eight popes--Urban VIII., Innocent X.,\r\nClement IX., Clement X., Innocent XII., Clement XI., Innocent XIII., and\r\nClement XII. Among its other pupils have been S. Camillo de Lellis, the\r\nBlessed Leonardo di Porto-Maurizio, the Venerable Pietro Berna, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n     \"Ignace, François Borgia, ont passé par ici. Leur souvenir plane,\r\n     comme un encouragement et une bénédiction, sur ces salles où ils\r\n     présidèrent aux études, sur ces chaires où peut-être retentit leur\r\n     parole, sur ces modestes cellules qu'ils ont habitées. A la fin du\r\n     seizième siècle, les élèves du collége Romain perdirent un de leurs\r\n     condisciples que sa douce aménité et ses vertus angéliques avaient\r\n     rendu l'objet d'un affectueux respect. Ce jeune homme avait été\r\n     page de Philippe II.; il était allié aux maisons royales\r\n     d'Autriche, de Bourbon et de Lorraine. Mais au milieu de ces\r\n     illusions d'une grande vie, sous ce brillant costume de cour qui\r\n     semblait lui promettre honneurs et fortune, il ne voyait jamais que\r\n     la pieuse figure de sa mère agenouillée au pied des autels, et\r\n     priant pour lui. A peine âgé de seize ans, il s'échappe de Madrid,\r\n     il vient frapper à la porte du collége Romain, et demande place, au\r\n     dortoir et à l'étude, pour Louis Gonzague, fils du comte de\r\n     Castiglione. Pendant sept ans, Louis donna dans cette maison le\r\n     touchant exemple d'une vie céleste; puis ses jours _déclinèrent_,\r\n     comme parle l'Ecriture; il avait assez vécu.\"--_Gournerie_, _Rome\r\n     Chrétienne_, ii. 211.\r\n\r\nWe now reach (on right) the _Church of Sta. Maria in Via Lata_, which\r\nwas founded by Sergius I., in the eighth century, but twice rebuilt, the\r\nsecond time under Alexander VII., in 1662, when the façade was added by\r\nPietro da Cortona.\r\n\r\n     In this church \"they still show a little chapel in which, as hath\r\n     been handed down from the first ages, St. Luke the Evangelist\r\n     wrote, and painted the effigy of the Virgin Mother of God.\"--_See\r\n     Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 155.\r\n\r\nThe subterranean church is shown as the actual house in which St. Paul\r\nlodged when he was in Rome.\r\n\r\n     \"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to\r\n     the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself\r\n     with a soldier that kept him.\"\r\n\r\n     \"And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into\r\n     his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God,\r\n     persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and\r\n     out of the prophets, from morning till evening.\" ...\r\n\r\n     \"And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and\r\n     received all that came in unto him, preaching the kingdom of God,\r\n     and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with\r\n     all confidence, no man forbidding him.\"--_Acts_ xxviii. 16, 23, 30,\r\n     31.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Paul after his arrival at Rome, having made his usual effort,\r\n     in the first place, for the salvation of his own countrymen, and as\r\n     usual, having found it vain, turned to the Gentiles, and during two\r\n     whole years, in which he was a prisoner, received all that came to\r\n     him, preaching the kingdom of God. It was thus that God overruled\r\n     his imprisonment for the furtherance of the gospel, so that his\r\n     bonds in Christ were manifest in the palace, and in all other\r\n     places, and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by\r\n     his bonds, were much more bold to speak the word without fear. Even\r\n     in the palace of Nero, the most noxious atmosphere, as we should\r\n     have concluded, for the growth of divine truth, his bonds were\r\n     manifest, the Lord Jesus was preached, and, more than this, was\r\n     received to the saving of many souls; for we find the Apostle\r\n     writing to his Philippian converts: 'All the saints salute you,\r\n     chiefly they which are of Cæsar's household.' The whole Church of\r\n     Christ has abundant reason to bless God for the dispensation which,\r\n     during the most matured period of St. Paul's Christian life,\r\n     detained him a close prisoner in the imperial city. Had he, to the\r\n     end of his course, been at large, occupied, as he had long been,\r\n     'in labours most abundant,' he would, humanly speaking, never have\r\n     found time to pen those epistles which are among the most blessed\r\n     portion of the Church's inheritance. It was from within the walls\r\n     of a prison, probably chained hand to hand to the soldier who kept\r\n     him, that St. Paul indited the Epistles to the Ephesians,\r\n     Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews.\"--_Blunt's Lectures on St.\r\n     Paul._\r\n\r\n     \"In writing to Philemon, Paul chooses to speak of himself as the\r\n     captive of Jesus Christ. Yet he went whither he would, and was free\r\n     to receive those who came to him. It is interesting to remember\r\n     amid these solemn vaults, the different events of St. Paul's\r\n     apostolate, during the two years that he lived here. It was here\r\n     that he converted Onesimus, that he received the presents of the\r\n     Philippians, brought by Epaphroditus; it was hence that he wrote to\r\n     Philemon, to Titus, to the inhabitants of Philippi and of Colosse;\r\n     it was here that he preached devotion to the cross with that\r\n     glowing eagerness, with that startling eloquence, which gained\r\n     fresh power from contest and which inspiration rendered sublime.\r\n\r\n     \"Peter addressed himself to the Circumcised; Paul to the\r\n     Gentiles,[13]--to their silence that he might confound it, to their\r\n     reason that he might humble it. Had he not already converted the\r\n     proconsul Sergius Paulus and Dionysius the Areopagite? At Rome his\r\n     word is equally powerful, and among the courtiers of Nero, perhaps\r\n     even amongst his relations, are those who yield to the power of\r\n     God, who reveals himself in each of the teachings of his\r\n     servant.[14] Around the Apostle his eager disciples group\r\n     themselves--Onesiphorus of Ephesus, who was not ashamed of his\r\n     chain;[15] Epaphras of Colosse, who was captive with him,\r\n     _concaptivus meus_;[16] Timothy, who was one with his master in a\r\n     holy union of every thought, and who was attached to him like a\r\n     son, _sicut patri filius_;[17] Hermas, Aristarchus, Marcus,\r\n     Demas--and Luke the physician, the faithful companion of the\r\n     Apostle, his well-beloved disciple--'Lucas medicus\r\n     carissimus.'\"--_From Gournerie, Rome Chrétienne._\r\n\r\n     \"I honour Rome for this reason; for though I could celebrate her\r\n     praises on many other accounts--for her greatness, for her beauty,\r\n     for her power, for her wealth, and for her warlike exploits,--yet,\r\n     passing over all these things, I glorify her on this account, that\r\n     Paul in his lifetime wrote to the Romans, and loved them, and was\r\n     present with and conversed with them, and ended his life amongst\r\n     them. Wherefore the city is on this account renowned more than on\r\n     all others--on this account I admire her, not on account of her\r\n     gold, her columns, or her other splendid decorations.\"--_St. John\r\n     Chrysostom, Homily on the Ep. to the Romans._\r\n\r\n     \"The Roman Jews expressed a wish to hear from St. Paul himself a\r\n     statement of his religious sentiments, adding that the Christian\r\n     sect was everywhere spoken against.... A day was fixed for the\r\n     meeting at his private lodging.\r\n\r\n     \"The Jews came in great numbers at the appointed time. Then\r\n     followed an impressive scene, like that at Troas (Acts xxi.)--the\r\n     Apostle pleading long and earnestly,--bearing testimony concerning\r\n     the kingdom of God,--and endeavouring to persuade them by arguments\r\n     drawn from their own Scriptures,--'from morning till evening.' The\r\n     result was a division among the auditors--'not peace, but a\r\n     sword,'--the division which has resulted ever since, when the Truth\r\n     of God has encountered, side by side, earnest conviction with\r\n     worldly indifference, honest investigation with bigoted prejudice,\r\n     trustful faith with the pride of scepticism. After a long and\r\n     stormy discussion, the unbelieving portion departed; but not until\r\n     St. Paul had warned them, in one last address, that they were\r\n     bringing upon themselves that awful doom of judicial blindness,\r\n     which was denounced in their own Scriptures against obstinate\r\n     unbelievers; that the salvation which they rejected would be\r\n     withdrawn from them, and the inheritance they renounced would be\r\n     given to the Gentiles. The sentence with which he gave emphasis to\r\n     this solemn warning was that passage in Isaiah, which recurring\r\n     thus with solemn force at the very close of the Apostolic history,\r\n     seems to bring very strikingly together the Old Dispensation and\r\n     the New, and to connect the ministry of Our Lord with that of His\r\n     Apostles:--'Go unto this people and say: Hearing ye shall hear and\r\n     shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see and shall not\r\n     perceive: for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their\r\n     ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest\r\n     they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and\r\n     understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should\r\n     heal them.'\r\n\r\n     \" ... During the long delay of his trial St. Paul was not reduced,\r\n     as he had been at Cæsarea, to a forced inactivity. On the contrary,\r\n     he was permitted the freest intercourse with his friends, and was\r\n     allowed to reside in a house of sufficient size to accommodate the\r\n     congregation which flocked together to listen to his teaching. The\r\n     freest scope was given to his labours, consistent with the military\r\n     custody under which he was placed. We are told, in language\r\n     peculiarly emphatic, that his preaching was subjected to no\r\n     restraint whatever. And that which seemed at first to impede, must\r\n     really have deepened the impression of his eloquence; for who could\r\n     see without emotion that venerable form subjected by iron links to\r\n     the coarse control of the soldier who stood beside him? how often\r\n     must the tears of the assembly have been called forth by the\r\n     upraising of that fettered hand, and the clanking of the chain\r\n     which checked its energetic action.\r\n\r\n     \"We shall see hereafter that these labours of the imprisoned\r\n     Confessor were not fruitless; in his own words, he 'begot many\r\n     children in his chains.' Meanwhile, he had a wider sphere of action\r\n     than even the metropolis of the world. Not only 'the crowd which\r\n     pressed upon him daily,' but also 'the care of all the churches'\r\n     demanded his constant vigilance and exertion.... To enable him to\r\n     maintain this superintendence, he manifestly needed many faithful\r\n     messengers; men who (as he says of one of them) 'rendered him\r\n     profitable service'; and by some of whom he seems to have been\r\n     constantly accompanied, wheresoever he went. Accordingly we find\r\n     him, during this Roman imprisonment, surrounded by many of his\r\n     oldest and most valued attendants. Luke, his fellow-traveller,\r\n     remained with him during his bondage; Timotheus, his beloved son in\r\n     the faith, ministered to him at Rome, as he had done in Asia, in\r\n     Macedonia, and in Achaia. Tychicus, who had formerly borne him\r\n     company from Corinth to Ephesus, is now at hand to carry his\r\n     letters to the shores which they had visited together. But there\r\n     are two names amongst his Roman companions which excite a peculiar\r\n     interest, though from opposite reasons,--the names of Demas and of\r\n     Mark. The latter, when last we heard of him, was the unhappy cause\r\n     of the separation of Barnabas and Paul. He was rejected by Paul, as\r\n     unworthy to attend him, because he had previously abandoned the\r\n     work of the Gospel out of timidity or indolence. It is delightful\r\n     to find him now ministering obediently to the very Apostle who had\r\n     then repudiated his services; still more to know that he\r\n     persevered in this fidelity even to the end, and was sent for by\r\n     St. Paul to cheer his dying hours. Demas, on the other hand, is now\r\n     a faithful 'fellow-labourer' of the Apostle but in a few years we\r\n     shall find that he had 'forsaken' him, having 'loved this present\r\n     world.'\r\n\r\n     \"Amongst the rest of St. Paul's companions at this time, there were\r\n     two whom he distinguishes by the honourable title of his\r\n     'fellow-prisoners.' One of these is Aristarchus, the other\r\n     Epaphras. With regard to the former, we know that he was a\r\n     Macedonian of Thessalonica, one of 'Paul's companions in travel,'\r\n     whose life was endangered by the mob at Ephesus, and who embarked\r\n     with St. Paul at Cæsarea when he set sail for Rome. The other,\r\n     Epaphras, was a Colossian, who must not be identified with the\r\n     Philippian Epaphroditus, another of St. Paul's fellow-labourers\r\n     during this time. It is not easy to say in what exact sense these\r\n     two disciples were peculiarly _fellow-prisoners_ of St. Paul.\r\n     Perhaps it only implies that they dwelt in his house, which was\r\n     also his prison.\r\n\r\n     \"But of all the disciples now ministering to St. Paul at Rome, none\r\n     has a greater interest than the fugitive Asiatic slave Onesimus. He\r\n     belonged to a Christian named Philemon, a member of the Colossian\r\n     Church. But he had robbed his master, and fled from Colosse, and at\r\n     last found his way to Rome. Here he was converted to the faith of\r\n     Christ, and had confessed to St. Paul his sins against his\r\n     master.\"--_Conybeare and Howson, Life of St. Paul._\r\n\r\nA fountain in the crypt is shown, as having miraculously sprung up in\r\nanswer to the prayers of St. Paul, that he might have wherewithal to\r\nbaptize his disciples. At the end of the crypt are some large blocks of\r\npeperino, said to be remains of the arch erected by the senate in honour\r\nof the Emperor Gordian III., and destroyed by Innocent VIII.\r\n\r\nFar along the right side of the Corso now extends the façade of the\r\nimmense _Palazzo Doria_, built by Valvasori (the front towards the\r\nCollegio Romano being by Pietro da Cortona, and that towards the Piazza\r\nVenezia by Amati). Entering the courtyard, one must turn left to reach\r\nthe _Picture Gallery_ (which is open on Tuesdays and Fridays, from ten\r\ntill two)--a vast collection, which contains some grand portraits and a\r\nfew other fine paintings.\r\n\r\nThe _1st Room_ entered is a great hall--to which pictures are removed\r\nfor copying. It contains four fine sarcophagi, with reliefs of the Hunt\r\nof Meleager, the Story of Marsyas, Endymion and Diana, and a Bacchic\r\nprocession. Of two ancient circular altars, one serves as the pedestal\r\nof a bearded Dionysus. The pictures are chiefly landscapes, of the\r\nschool of Poussin and Salvator Rosa,--that of the Deluge is by _Ippolito\r\nScarsellino_.\r\n\r\n_2nd Room._--In the centre a Centaur (restored), of basalt and\r\nrosso-antico.

Scriptor:\" _Bronzino_.\r\n\r\n     12. \"The Mill:\" _Claude Lorraine_.*\r\n\r\n     \"The foreground of the picture of 'the Mill' is a piece of very\r\n     lovely and perfect forest scenery, with a dance of peasants by a\r\n     brook-side; quite enough subject to form, in the hands of a master,\r\n     an impressive and complete picture. On the other side of the brook,\r\n     however, we have a piece of pastoral life; a man with some bulls\r\n     and goats tumbling head foremost into the water, owing to some\r\n     sudden paralytic affection of all their legs. Even this group is\r\n     one too many; the shepherd had no business to drive his flock so\r\n     near the dancers, and the dancers will certainly frighten the\r\n     cattle. But when we look farther into the picture, our feelings\r\n     receive a sudden and violent shock, by the unexpected appearance,\r\n     amidst things pastoral and musical, of the military; a number of\r\n     Roman soldiers riding in on hobby-horses, with a leader on foot,\r\n     apparently encouraging them to make an immediate and decisive\r\n     charge on the musicians. Beyond the soldiers is a circular temple,\r\n     in exceedingly bad repair; and close beside it, built against its\r\n     very walls, a neat water-mill in full work; by the mill flows a\r\n     large river with a weir across it.... At an inconvenient distance\r\n     from the water-side stands a city, composed of twenty-five round\r\n     towers and a pyramid. Beyond the city is a handsome bridge; beyond\r\n     the bridge, part of the Campagna, with fragments of aqueducts;\r\n     beyond the Campagna the chain of the Alps; on the left, the\r\n     cascades of Tivoli.\r\n\r\n     \"This is a fair example of what is commonly called an 'ideal'\r\n     landscape; _i.e._ a group of the artist's studies from nature,\r\n     individually spoiled, selected with such opposition of character as\r\n     may insure their neutralizing each other's effect, and united with\r\n     sufficient unnaturalness and violence of association to insure\r\n     their producing a general sensation of the impossible.\"--_Ruskin's\r\n     Modern Painters._\r\n\r\n     \"Many painters take a particular spot, and sketch it to perfection;\r\n     but Claude was convinced that taking nature as he found it, seldom\r\n     produced beauty. Neither did he like exhibiting in his pictures\r\n     accidents of nature. He professed to pourtray the style of general\r\n     nature, and so his pictures were a composition of the various\r\n     draughts which he had previously made from beautiful scenes and\r\n     prospects.\"--_Sir J. Reynolds._\r\n\r\n     18. Pietà: _Ann. Caracci_.\r\n\r\n     23. Landscape, with the Temple of Apollo: _Claude Lorraine_.\r\n\r\n     26. Portrait: _Mazzolino_.\r\n\r\n     27. Portrait: _Giorgione_.\r\n\r\n     33. Landscape, with Diana hunting: _Claude Lorraine_.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this gallery is a small cabinet, containing the gems of\r\nthe collection:--\r\n\r\n     1. Portrait of a \"Letterato:\" _Lucas V. Leyden?_*\r\n\r\n     2. Portrait of Andrea Doria: _Sebastian del Piombo_.*\r\n\r\n     3. Portrait of Giannetto Doria: _Bronzino_.*\r\n\r\n     4. Portrait of S. Filippo Neri, as a boy: _Barocci_.\r\n\r\n     5. Portrait of Innocent X.; Gio. Battista Pamfili (1644--55):\r\n     _Velasquez_.*\r\n\r\n     6. Entombment: _John Emelingk_.*\r\n\r\nHere, also, is the bust of the late beloved Princess Doria (Lady Mary\r\nTalbot), which has always been veiled in crape since her death.\r\n\r\nThe _4th Gallery_ is decorated with mirrors, and with statues of no\r\nespecial merit.\r\n\r\n     \"In the whole immense range of rooms of the Palazzo Doria, I saw\r\n     but a single fire-place, and that so deep in the wall that no\r\n     amount of blaze would raise the atmosphere of the room ten degrees.\r\n     If the builder of the palace, or any of his successors, have\r\n     committed crimes worthy of Tophet, it would be a still worse\r\n     punishment to him to wander perpetually through this suite of\r\n     rooms, on the cold floors of polished brick tiles, or marble, or\r\n     mosaic, growing a little chiller and chiller through every moment\r\n     of eternity--or at least, till the palace crumbles down upon\r\n     him.\"--_Hawthorne, Notes on Italy._\r\n\r\nOpposite the Palazzo Doria is the _Palazzo Salviati_. The next two\r\nstreets on the left lead into the long narrow square called _Piazza\r\nSanti Apostoli_, containing several handsome palaces. That on the right\r\nis the _Palazzo Odescalchi_, built by Bernini, in 1660, for Cardinal\r\nFabio Chigi, to whose family it formerly belonged. It has some fine\r\npainted and carved wooden ceilings. This palace is supposed to be the\r\nscene of the latest miracle of the Roman Catholic Church. The present\r\nPrincess Odescalchi had long been bedridden, and was apparently dying of\r\na hopeless disease, when, while her family were watching what they\r\nconsidered her last moments, the pope (Pius IX.) sent, by the hands of a\r\nnun, a little loaf (panetello), which he desired her to swallow. With\r\nterrible effort, the sick woman obeyed, and was immediately healed, and\r\non the following day the astonished Romans saw her go in person to the\r\npope, at the Vatican, to return thanks for her restoration!\r\n\r\nThe building at the end of the square is the _Palazzo Valentini_, which\r\nonce contained a collection of antiquities.\r\n\r\nNear this, on the left, but separated from the piazza by a courtyard, is\r\nthe vast _Palazzo Colonna_, begun, in the fifteenth century, by Martin\r\nV., and continued at various later periods. Julius II. at one time made\r\nit his residence, and also Cardinal (afterwards San Carlo) Borromeo.\r\nPart of it is now the residence of the French ambassadors. The palace is\r\nbuilt very near the site of the ancient fortress of the Colonna\r\nfamily--so celebrated in times of mediæval warfare with the Orsini--of\r\nwhich one lofty tower still remains, in a street leading up to the\r\nQuirinal.\r\n\r\nThe _Gallery_ is shown every day, except Sundays and holidays, from 11\r\nto 3. It is entered by the left wing. The first room is a fine, gloomy\r\nold hall, containing the family dais, and hung with decaying Colonna\r\nportraits. Then come three rooms covered with tapestries, the last\r\ncontaining a pretty statue of a girl, sometimes called Niobe. Hence we\r\nreach the pictures. The _1st Room_ has an interesting collection of the\r\nearly schools, including Madonnas of _Filippo Lippi_; _Luca Longhi_;\r\n_Botticelli_; _Gentile da Fabriano_; _Innocenza da Imola_; a curious\r\nCrucifixion, by _Jacopo d'Avanzo_; and a portrait by _Giovanni Sanzio_,\r\nfather of Raphael.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of the _3rd Room_ has a fresco, by _Battoni_ and _Luti_, of\r\nthe apotheosis of Martin V. (Oddone Colonna, 1417--24). Among its\r\npictures, are St. Bernard, _Giovanni Bellini_; Onuphrius Pavinius,\r\n_Titian_; Holy Family, _Bronzino_; Peasant dining, _Annibale Caracci_;\r\nSt. Jerome, _Spagna_; Portrait, _Paul Veronese_; Holy Family,\r\n_Bonifazio_.\r\n\r\nHence we enter the _Great Hall_, a truly grand room, hung with mirrors\r\nand painted with flowers by _Mario de' Fiori_, and with genii by\r\n_Maratta_. The statues here are unimportant. The ceiling is adorned with\r\npaintings, by _Coli_ and _Gherardi_, of the battle of Lepanto, Oct. 8,\r\n1571, which Marc-Antonio Colonna assisted in gaining. The best pictures\r\nare the family portraits:--Federigo Colonna, _Sustermanns_; Don Carlo\r\nColonna, _Vandyke_; Card. Pompeio Colonna, _Lorenzo Lotto_; Vittoria\r\nColonna, _Muziano_; Lucrezia Colonna, _Vandyke_; Pompeio Colonna,\r\n_Agostino Caracci_; Giacomo Sciarra Colonna, _Giorgione_. We may also\r\nnotice an extraordinary picture of the Madonna rescuing a child from a\r\ndemon, by _Niccolo d'Alunno_, with a double portrait, by _Tintoret_, on\r\nthe right wall, and a Holy Family of _Palma Vecchio_ at the end of the\r\ngallery. Near the entrance are some glorious old cabinets, inlaid with\r\nivory and lapis-lazuli. On the steps leading to the upper end of the\r\nhall is a bomb left on the spot where it fell during the siege of Rome\r\nin 1848.\r\n\r\n(Through the palace access may be obtained to the beautiful Colonna\r\nGardens; but as they are generally visited from the Quirinal, they will\r\nbe noticed in the description of that hill.)\r\n\r\n     \"On parle d'un Pierre Colonna, dépouillé de tous ses biens en 1100\r\n     par le pape Pascal II.

The portico contains a\r\nmagnificent bas-relief of an eagle and an oak-wreath (frequently copied\r\nand introduced in architectural designs).\r\n\r\n     \"Entrez sous la portique de l'église des Saints-Apôtres, et vous\r\n     trouverez là, encadré par hasard dans le mur, un aigle qu'entoure\r\n     une couronne d'un magnifique travail.

Over the sacristy door is the tomb of Pope Clement XIV. (Giov.\r\nAntonio Ganganelli, 1769-74), also by Canova, executed in his\r\ntwenty-fifth year.\r\n\r\n     \"La mort de Clément XIV. est du 22 Septembre, 1774.

Two bodies were found, enclosed in a sarcophagus of\r\nbeautiful transparent marble, and have been duly enshrined. In the choir\r\nare monuments of the fifteenth century, to two relations of Pope Sixtus\r\nIV., Pietro Riario, and Cardinal Raffaelo Riario. To the right is the\r\ntomb of the Chevalier Girard, brother-in-law of Pope Julius II., and\r\nmaître d'hôtel to Charles VIII. and Louis XII. of France. The tomb of\r\nCardinal Bessarion was removed from the church, in 1702, to the\r\ncloisters of the adjoining Convent, which is the residence of the\r\nGeneral of the Order of \"Minori Conventuali\" (Black Friars). The\r\naltar-piece represents the martyrdom of SS. Philip and James, by\r\n_Muratori_.\r\n\r\nThe heart of Maria Clementina Sobieski (buried in St. Peter's), wife of\r\nJames III., called the First Pretender, is also preserved here, as is\r\nshown by a Latin inscription.\r\n\r\n     \"Le roi d'Angleterre est devot a l'excès; sa matinée se passe en\r\n     prières aux Saints-Apôtres, près du tombeau de sa femme.\"--_De\r\n     Brosses_, 1739.\r\n\r\nIn 1552 this church was remarkable for the sermons of the monk Felix\r\nPeretti, afterwards Sixtus V.\r\n\r\n     \"Suivant un manuscrit de la bibliothèque Alfieri, un jour, pendant\r\n     qu'il était dans la chaire des Saints-Apôtres, un billet cacheté\r\n     lui fut remis; Frère Félix l'ouvre et y lit, en face d'un certain\r\n     nombre de propositions que l'on disait être extraites de ses\r\n     discours, ce mot écrit en gros caractères: MENTIRIS (tu mens).

But Count Feraldi (Savorelli) considered\r\n     that it was due to his honour and to his vengeance to bear her\r\n     remains with pomp to the tomb of his family. He had sufficient\r\n     influence to obtain that for which permission is not granted once\r\n     in ten years: the right of transporting her uncovered, upon a bed\r\n     of white velvet, and of sparing her the horrors of a coffin. The\r\n     beloved remains were wrapped in the white muslin robe which she\r\n     wore in the garden on the day when she exchanged her sweet vows\r\n     with Lello. The Marchesa Trasimeni, ill and wasted as she was, came\r\n     herself to arrange her hair in the manner she loved. Every garden\r\n     in Rome despoiled itself to send her its flowers; it was only\r\n     necessary to choose. The funeral procession quitted the church of\r\n     S. Antonio Abbate on Thursday evening at 7.30 for the Santi\r\n     Apostoli, where the Feraldis are buried. The body was preceded by a\r\n     long file of the black and white confraternities, each bearing its\r\n     banner. The red light of the torches played upon the countenance of\r\n     the beautiful dead, and seemed to animate her afresh. The piazza\r\n     was filled with a dense and closely packed but dumb crowd; no\r\n     discordant sound troubled the grief of the relations and friends of\r\n     Tolla, who wept together at the Palazzo Feraldi....\r\n\r\n     \"The Church of the Apostoli and the tomb of the poor loving girl,\r\n     became at certain days of the year an object of pilgrimage, and\r\n     more than one young Roman maiden adds to her evening litany the\r\n     words, 'St. Tolla, virgin and martyr, pray for us.'\"--_About._\r\n\r\nJust beyond the church is the _Palazzo Muto-Savorelli_ (the home of\r\nTolla, \"Palazzo Feraldi\") long the residence of Prince Charles Edward\r\n(\"the last Pretender\"), who died here in 1788. Hence the _Via delle\r\nVergini_, with its dismal lines of latticed convent-windows, leads to\r\nthe Fountain of Trevi.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Corso, we pass (right) _Palazzo Buonaparte_, built by\r\nGiovanni dei Rossi in 1660. Here Lætitia Buonaparte--\"Madame Mère\"--the\r\nmother of Napoleon I., died February 2nd, 1836. The present head of the\r\nfamily is Cardinal Lucien-Louis Buonaparte, son of Prince Charles (son\r\nof Lucien) and of Princess Zénaïde, daughter of King Joseph of Spain.\r\nHis only surviving brother is Prince Napoleon Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nThis palace forms one corner of the _Piazza di Venezia_, which contains\r\nthe ancient castellated _Palace_ of the Republic of Venice, built in\r\n1468 by Giuliano da Majano (with materials plundered from the Coliseum)\r\nfor Paul II., who was of Venetian birth. On the ruin of the republic the\r\npalace fell into the hands of Austria, and is still the residence of the\r\nAustrian ambassador, to whom it was specially reserved on the cession of\r\nVenice to Italy.\r\n\r\nOpposite this, on a line with the Corso, is the _Palazzo Torlonia_,\r\nbuilt by Fontana in 1650, for the Bolognetti family.\r\n\r\n     \"Nobility is certainly more the fruit of wealth in Italy than in\r\n     England. Here, where a title and estate are sold together, a man\r\n     who can buy the one secures the other. From the station of a\r\n     lacquey, an Italian who can amass riches, may rise to that of duke.\r\n     Thus Torlonia, the Roman banker, purchased the title and estate of\r\n     the Duca di Bracciano, fitted up the 'Palazzo Nuovo di Torlonia'\r\n     with all the magnificence that wealth commands; and a marble\r\n     gallery, with its polished floors, modern statues, painted\r\n     ceilings, and gilded furniture, far outshines the faded splendour\r\n     of the halls of the old Roman nobility.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"Un ancien domestique de place, devenu spéculateur et banquier,\r\n     achète un marquisat, puis une principauté.

L'un\r\n     épouse une Sforza-Cesarini et marie ses deux fils à une Chigi et\r\n     une Ruspoli; l'autre obtient pour femme une Colonna-Doria. C'est\r\n     ainsi que la famille Torlonia, par la puissance de l'argent et la\r\n     faveur du saint-père, s'est élevée presque subitement à la hauteur\r\n     des plus grands maisons népotiques et féodales.\"--_About._\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the antiquities preserved in this palace is a\r\nbas-relief, representing a combat between men and animals, brought\r\nhither from the Palazzo Orsini, and probably pourtraying the famous\r\ndedication of the theatre of Marcellus on that site, celebrated by the\r\nslaughter of six hundred animals.\r\n\r\nThe end of the Corso--narrowed by a projecting wing of the Venetian\r\nPalace--is known as the _Ripresa dei Barberi_, because there the\r\nhorses, which run in the races during the Carnival, are caught in large\r\nfolds of drapery let down across the street to prevent their dashing\r\nthemselves to pieces against the opposite wall.\r\n\r\nClose to the end of this street, built into the wall of a house in the\r\nVia di Marforio, is one of the few relics of republican times in the\r\ncity,--a Doric _Tomb_, bearing an inscription which states that it was\r\nerected by order of the people on land granted by the Senate to Caius\r\nPublicius Bibulus, the plebeian ædile, and his posterity. Petrarch\r\nmentions in one of his letters that he wrote one of his sonnets leaning\r\nagainst the tomb of Bibulus.\r\n\r\nThis tomb has a secondary interest as marking the commencement of the\r\nVia Flaminia, as it stood just outside the Porta Ratumena from whence\r\nthat road issued. There are some obscure remains of another tomb on the\r\nother side of the street. The Via Flaminia, like the Via Appia, was once\r\nfringed with tombs.\r\n\r\nFrom the Ripresa dei Barberi, a street passing under an arch on the\r\nright, leads to the back of the Venetian Palace, where is the _Church of\r\nS. Marco_, originally founded in the time of Constantine, but rebuilt in\r\n833, and modernized by Cardinal Quirini in 1744. Its portico, which is\r\nlined with early Christian inscriptions, contains a fine fifteenth\r\ncentury doorway, surmounted by a figure of St. Mark. The interior is in\r\nthe form of a basilica, its naves and aisles separated by twenty\r\ncolumns, and ending in an apse. The best pictures are S. Marco, \"a pope\r\nenthroned, by _Carlo Crivelli_, resembling in sharpness of finish and\r\nindividuality the works of Bartolomeo Viviani,\"[18] and a Resurrection\r\nby _Palma Giovane_.\r\n\r\n     \"The mosaics of S. Marco, executed under Pope Gregory IV. (A.D.\r\n     827--844), with all their splendour, exhibit the utmost poverty of\r\n     expression. Above the tribune, in circular compartments, is the\r\n     portrait of Christ between the symbols of the Evangelists, and\r\n     further below SS. Peter and Paul (or two prophets) with scrolls;\r\n     within the tribune, beneath a hand extended with a wreath, is the\r\n     standing figure of Christ with an open book, and on either side, S.\r\n     Angelo and Pope Gregory IV. Further on, but still belonging to the\r\n     dome, are the thirteen lambs, forming a second and quite uneven\r\n     circle round the figures. The execution is here especially rude,\r\n     and of true Byzantine rigidity, while, as if the artist knew that\r\n     his long lean figures were anything but secure upon their feet, he\r\n     has given them each a separate little pedestal. The lines of the\r\n     drapery are chiefly straight and parallel, while, with all this\r\n     rudeness, a certain play of colour has been contrived by the\r\n     introduction of high lights of another colour.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nThis church is said to have been originally founded in honour of the\r\nEvangelist in 337 by Pope Marco, but this pope, being himself canonized,\r\nis also honoured here, and is buried under the high altar. On April\r\n25th, St. Mark's Day, a grand procession of clergy starts from this\r\nchurch. It was for the most part rebuilt under Gregory IV. in 838.\r\n\r\nBehind the Palazzo Venezia is the vast _Church of Il Gesù_, begun in\r\n1568 by the celebrated Vignola, but the cupola and façade completed in\r\n1575 by his scholar Giacomo della Porta. In the interior is the monument\r\nof Cardinal Bellarmin, and various pictures representing events in the\r\nlives or deaths of the Jesuit saints,--that of the death of St. Francis\r\nXavier is by _Carlo Maratta_. The high altar, by Giacomo della Porta,\r\nhas fine columns of giallo-antico. The altar of St. Ignatius at the end\r\nof the left transept is of gaudy magnificence. It was designed by Padre\r\nPozzi, the group of the Trinity being by Bernardino Ludovisi; the globe\r\nin the hand of the Almighty is said to be the largest piece of\r\nlapis-lazuli in existence. Beneath this altar, and his silver statue,\r\nlies the body of St. Ignatius Loyola, in an urn of gilt bronze, adorned\r\nwith precious stones. A great ceremony takes place in this church on\r\nJuly 31st, the feast of St. Ignatius, and on December 31st a Te Deum is\r\nsung here for the mercies of the past year, in the presence of the pope,\r\ncardinals, and the people of Rome,--a really solemn and impressive\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe _Convent of the Gesù_ is the residence of the General of the Jesuits\r\n(\"His Paternity\"), and the centre of religious life in their Order. The\r\nrooms in which St. Ignatius lived and died are of the deepest historic\r\ninterest. They consist of four chambers. The first, now a chapel, is\r\nthat in which he wrote his \"Constitutions.\" The second, also a chapel,\r\nis that in which he died. It contains the altar at which he daily\r\ncelebrated mass, and the autograph engagement to live under the same\r\nlaws of obedience, poverty, and chastity, signed by Laynez, Francis\r\nXavier, and Ignatius Loyola. On its walls are two portraits of Ignatius\r\nLoyola, one as a young knight, the other as a Jesuit father, and\r\nportraits of S. Carlo Borromeo and S. Filippo Neri. It was in this\r\nchamber also that St. Francis Borgia died. The third room was that of\r\nthe attendant monk of St. Ignatius; the fourth is now a kind of museum\r\nof relics containing portions of his robes and small articles which\r\nbelonged to him and to other saints of the Order.\r\n\r\nFacing the Church of the Gesù is the _Palazzo Altieri_, built by\r\nCardinal Altieri in 1670, from designs of Giov. Antonio Rossi.\r\n\r\n     \"Quand le palais Altieri fut achevé, les Altieri, neveux de Clément\r\n     X., invitèrent leur oncle à le venir voir. Il s'y fit porter, et\r\n     d'aussi loin qu'il aperçut la magnificence et l'étendue de cette\r\n     superbe fabrique, il reboussa chemin le cœur serré, sans dire un\r\n     seul mot, et mourut peu après.\"--_De Brosses._\r\n\r\n     \"On the staircase of the Palazzo Altieri, is an ancient colossal\r\n     marble _finger_, of such extraordinary size, that it is really\r\n     worth a visit.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nThis palace was the residence of the late noble-hearted vicar-general,\r\nCardinal Altieri, who died a martyr to his devotion to his flock (as\r\nBishop of Albano) during the terrible visitation of cholera at Albano in\r\n1867.\r\n\r\nThe _Piazza del Gesù_ is considered to be the most draughty place in\r\nRome. The legend runs that the devil and the wind were one day taking a\r\nwalk together. When they came to this square, the devil, who seemed to\r\nbe very devout, said to the wind, \"Just wait a minute, mio caro, while I\r\ngo into this church.\" So the wind promised, and the devil went into the\r\nGesù, and has never come out again--and the wind is blowing about in the\r\nPiazza del Gesù to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPITOLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Story of the Hill--Piazza del Campidoglio--Palace of the\r\n     Senator--View from the Capitol Tower--The Tabularium--The Museo\r\n     Capitolino--Gallery of Statues--Palace of the Conservators--Gallery\r\n     of Pictures--Palazzo Caffarelli--Tarpeian Rock--Convent and Church\r\n     of Ara-Cœli--Mamertine Prisons.\r\n\r\nThe Capitoline was the hill of the kings and the republic, as the\r\nPalatine was of the empire.\r\n\r\nEntirely composed of tufa, its sides, now concealed by buildings or by\r\nthe accumulated rubbish of ages, were abrupt and precipitous, as are\r\nstill the sides of the neighbouring citadels of Corneto and Cervetri. It\r\nwas united to the Quirinal by an isthmus of land cut away by Trajan, but\r\nin every other direction was isolated by its perpendicular cliffs:--\r\n\r\n    \"Arduus in valles et fora clivus erat.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ i. 264.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the Tarquins, it bore the name of Mons Saturnus,[19]\r\nfrom the mythical king Saturn, who is reported to have come to Italy in\r\nthe reign of Janus, and to have made a settlement here. His name was\r\nderived from sowing, and he was looked upon as the introducer of\r\ncivilization and social order, both of which are inseparably connected\r\nwith agriculture. His reign here was thus considered to be the golden\r\nage of Italy. His wife was Ops, the representative of plenty.[20]\r\n\r\n     \"C'est la tradition d'un âge de paix représenté par le règne\r\n     paisible de Saturne; avant qu'il y eut une _Roma_, ville de la\r\n     force, il y eut une _Saturnia_, ville de la paix.\"--_Ampère, Hist.\r\n     Rom._ i. 86.\r\n\r\nVirgil represents Evander, the mythical king of the Palatine, as\r\nexhibiting Saturnia, already in ruins, to Æneas.\r\n\r\n    \"Hæc duo præterea disjectis oppida muris,\r\n    Reliquias veterumque vides monumenta virorum.\r\n    Hanc Janus pater, hanc Saturnus condidit arcem:\r\n    Janiculum huic, illi fuerat Saturnia nomen.\"\r\n\r\n    _Æn._ viii. 356.\r\n\r\nWhen Romulus had fixed his settlement upon the Palatine, he opened an\r\nasylum for fugitive slaves upon the then deserted Saturnus, and here, at\r\na sacred oak, he is said to have offered up the spoils of the\r\nCæcinenses, and their king Acron, who had made a war of reprisal upon\r\nhim, after the rape of their women in the Campus Martius; here also he\r\nvowed to build a temple to Jupiter Feretrius, where spoils should always\r\nbe offered. But in the mean time, the Sabines, under Titius Tatus,\r\nbesieged and took the hill, having a gate of its fortress (said to have\r\nbeen on the ascent above the spot where the arch of Severus now stands)\r\nopened to them by Tarpeia, who gazed with longing upon the golden\r\nbracelets of the warriors, and, obtaining a promise to receive that\r\nwhich they wore upon their arms, was crushed by their shields as they\r\nentered. Some authorities, however, maintain that she asked and obtained\r\nthe hand of king Tatius. From this time the hill was completely occupied\r\nby the Sabines, and its name became partially merged in that of _Mons\r\nTarpeia_, which its southern side has always retained. Niebuhr states\r\nthat it is a popular superstition that the beautiful Tarpeia still sits,\r\nsparkling with gold and jewels, enchanted and motionless, in a cave in\r\nthe centre of the hill.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Tatius, the Capitoline again fell under the\r\ngovernment of Romulus, and his successor, Numa Pompilius, founded here a\r\nTemple of Fides Publica, in which the flamens were always to sacrifice\r\nwith a fillet on their right hands, in sign of fidelity. To Numa also is\r\nattributed the worship of the god Terminus, who had a temple here in\r\nvery early ages.\r\n\r\nUnder Tarquinius Superbus, B.C. 535, the magnificent _Temple of Jupiter\r\nCapitolinus_, which had been vowed by his father, was built with money\r\ntaken from the Volscians in war. In digging its foundations, the head of\r\na man was found, still bloody, an omen which was interpreted by an\r\nEtruscan augur to portend that Rome would become the head of Italy. In\r\nconsequence of this, the name of the hill was once more changed, and has\r\never since been _Mons Capitolinus_, or Capitolium.\r\n\r\nThe site of this temple has always been one of the vexed questions of\r\nhistory. At the time it was built, as now, the hill consisted of two\r\npeaks, with a level space between them. Niebuhr and Gregorovius place\r\nthe temple on the south-eastern height, but Canina and other\r\nauthorities, with more probability, incline to the north-eastern\r\neminence, the present site of Ara-Cœli, because, among many other\r\nreasons, the temple faced the south, and also the Forum, which it could\r\nnot have done upon the south-eastern summit; and also because the\r\ncitadel is always represented as having been nearer to the Tiber than\r\nthe temple: for when Herdonius, and the Gauls, arriving by the river,\r\nscaled the heights of the Capitol, it was the _citadel_ which barred\r\ntheir path, and in which, in the latter case, Manlius was awakened by\r\nthe noise of the sacred geese of Juno.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Jupiter occupied a lofty platform, the summit of the rock\r\nbeing levelled to receive it. Its façade was decorated with three ranges\r\nof columns, and its sides by a single colonnade. It was nearly square,\r\nbeing 200 Roman feet in length, and 185 in width.[21] The interior was\r\ndivided into three cells; the figure of Jupiter occupied that in the\r\ncentre, Minerva was on his right, and Juno on his left. The figure of\r\nJupiter was the work of an artist of the Volscian city of Fregellæ,[22]\r\nand was formed of terra-cotta, painted like the statues which we may\r\nstill see in the Etruscan museum at the Vatican, and clothed with the\r\ntunica palmata, and the toga picta, the costume of victorious generals.\r\nIn his right hand was a thunder-bolt, and in his left a spear.\r\n\r\n    \"Jupiter angusta vix totus stabat in Æde;\r\n      Inque Jovis dextra fictile fulmen erat.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ i. 202.\r\n\r\nAt a later period the statue was formed of gold, but this figure had\r\nceased to exist in the time of Pliny.[23] When Martial wrote, the\r\nstatues of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, were all gilt.\r\n\r\n    \"Scriptus es æterno nunc primum, Jupiter, auro,\r\n    Et soror, et summi filia tota patris.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial,_ xi. _Ep._ 5.\r\n\r\nIn the wall adjoining the cella of Minerva, a nail was fastened every\r\nyear, to mark the lapse of time.[24] In the centre of the temple was the\r\nstatue of Terminus.\r\n\r\n     \"The sumptuous fane of Jupiter Capitolinus had peculiar claims on\r\n     the veneration of the Roman citizens; for not only the great lord\r\n     of the earth was worshipped in it, but the conservative principle\r\n     of property itself found therein its appropriate symbol. While the\r\n     statue of Jupiter occupied the usual place of the divinity in the\r\n     furthest recess of the building, an image of the god Terminus was\r\n     also placed in the centre of the nave, which was open to the\r\n     heavens. A venerable legend affirmed, that when, in the time of the\r\n     kings, it was requisite to clear a space on the Capitoline to erect\r\n     on it a temple to the great father of the gods, and the shrines of\r\n     the lesser divinities were to be removed for the purpose, Terminus\r\n     alone, the patron of boundaries, refused to quit his place, and\r\n     demanded to be included in the walls of the new edifice. Thus\r\n     propitiated he was understood to declare that henceforth the bounds\r\n     of the republic should never be removed; and the pledge was more\r\n     than fulfilled by the ever increasing circuit of her\r\n     dominion.\"--_Merivale, Romans Under the Empire._\r\n\r\nThe gates of the temple were of gilt bronze, and its pavement of\r\nmosaic;[25] in a vault beneath were preserved the Sibylline books placed\r\nthere by Tarquin. The building of Tarquin lasted 400 years, and was\r\nburnt down in the civil wars, B.C. 83. It was rebuilt very soon\r\nafterwards by Sylla, and adorned with columns of Pentelic marble, which\r\nhe had brought from the temple of Jupiter Olympus at Athens.[26] Sylla,\r\nhowever, did not live to rededicate it, and it was finished by Q.\r\nLutatius Catulus, B.C. 62. This temple lasted till it was burnt to the\r\nground by the soldiers of Vitellius, who set fire to it by throwing\r\ntorches upon the portico, A.D. 69, and dragging forth Sabinus, the\r\nbrother of Vespasian, murdered him at the foot of the Capitol, near the\r\nMamertine Prisons.[27] Domitian, the younger son of Vespasian, was, at\r\nthat time, in the temple with his uncle, and escaped in the dress of a\r\npriest; in commemoration of which, he erected a chapel to Jupiter\r\nConservator, close to the temple, with an altar upon which his adventure\r\nwas sculptured. The temple was rebuilt by Vespasian, who took so great\r\nan interest in the work, that he carried away some of the rubbish on his\r\nown shoulders; but his temple was the exact likeness of its predecessor,\r\nonly higher, as the aruspices said that the gods would not allow it to\r\nbe altered.[28] In this building Titus and Vespasian celebrated their\r\ntriumph for the fall of Jerusalem. The ruin of the temple began in A.D.\r\n404, during the short visit of the youthful Emperor Honorius to Rome,\r\nwhen the plates of gold which lined its doors were stripped off by\r\nStilicho.[29] It was finally plundered by the Vandals, in A.D. 455, when\r\nits statues were carried off to adorn the African palace of Genseric,\r\nand half its roof was stripped of the gilt bronze tiles which covered\r\nit; but it is not known precisely when it ceased to exist,--the early\r\nfathers of the Christian Church speak of having seen it. The story that\r\nthe bronze statue of Jupiter, belonging to this temple, was transformed\r\nby Leo I. into the famous image of St. Peter, is very doubtful.\r\n\r\nClose beside this, the queen of Roman temples, stood the _Temple of\r\nFides_, said to have been founded by Numa, where the senate were\r\nassembled at the time of the murder of Tiberius Gracchus, B.C. 133, who\r\nfell in front of the temple of Jupiter, at the foot of the statues of\r\nthe kings: his blood being the first spilt in Rome in a civil war.[30]\r\nNear this, also, were the twin _Temples of Mars and Venus Erycina_,\r\nvowed after the battle of Thrasymene, and consecrated, B.C. 215, by the\r\nconsuls Q. Fabius Maximus and T. Otacilius Crassus. Near the top of the\r\nClivus was the _Temple of Jupiter Tonans_, built by Augustus, in\r\nconsequence of a vow which he made in an expedition against the Cantabri\r\nwhen his litter was struck, and the slave who preceded him was killed by\r\nlightning. This temple was so near, that it was considered as a porch to\r\nthat of Jupiter Capitolinus, and in token of that character, Augustus\r\nhung some bells upon its pediment.\r\n\r\nOn the Arx, or opposite height of the Capitol, was the _Temple of Honour\r\nand Virtue_, built B.C. 103, by Marius, with the spoils taken in the\r\nCimbric wars. This temple was of sufficient size to allow of the senate\r\nmeeting there, to pass the decree for Cicero's recall.[31] Here Nardini\r\nplaces the ancient _Temple of Jupiter Feretrius_, in which Romulus\r\ndedicated the first spolia opima. Here, on the site of the house of\r\nManlius, was built the _Temple of Juno Moneta_, B.C. 345, in accordance\r\nwith a vow of L. Furius Camillus.[32] On this height, also, was the\r\n_Altar of Jupiter Pistor_, which commemorated the stratagem of the\r\nRomans, who threw down loaves into the camp of the besieging Gauls, to\r\ndeceive them as to the state of their supplies.[33]\r\n\r\n    \"Nomine, quam pretio celebratior, arce Tonantis,\r\n      Dicam Pistoris quid velit ara Jovis.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ vi. 349.\r\n\r\nIt was probably also on this side of the hill that the gigantic _Statue\r\nof Jupiter_ stood, which was formed out of the armour taken from the\r\nSamnites, B.C. 293, and which is stated by Pliny to have been of such a\r\nsize that it was visible from the top of Monte Cavo.\r\n\r\nTwo cliffs are now rival claimants to be considered as the Tarpeian\r\nRock; but it is most probable that the whole of the hill on this side of\r\nthe Intermontium was called the Mons Tarpeia, and was celebrated under\r\nthat name by the poets.\r\n\r\n    \"In summo custos Tarpeiæ Manlius arcis\r\n    Stabat pro templo, et Capitolia celsa tenebat:\r\n    Romuleoque recens horrebat regia culmo.\r\n    Atque hic auratis volitans argenteus anser\r\n    Porticibus, Gallos in limine adesse canebat.\"\r\n\r\n    _Virgil, Æn._ viii. 652.\r\n\r\n    \"Aurea Tarpeia ponet Capitolia rupe,\r\n    Et junget nostro templorum culmina cœlo.\"\r\n\r\n    _Sil. Ital._ iii. 623.\r\n\r\n    ... \"juvat inter tecta Tonantis,\r\n    Cernere Tarpeia pendentes rupe Gigantes.\"\r\n\r\n    _Claud._ vi. _Cons. Hon._ 44.\r\n\r\nAmong the buildings upon the _Intermontium_, or space between the two\r\nheights, were the Tabularium, or Record Office, part of which still\r\nremains; a portico, built by Scipio Nasica,[34] and an arch which Nero\r\nbuilt here to his own honour, the erection of which upon the sacred\r\nhill, hitherto devoted to the gods, was regarded even by the subservient\r\nsenate as an unparalleled act of presumption.[35]\r\n\r\nIn mediæval times the revolutionary government of Arnold of Brescia\r\nestablished itself on this hill (1144), and Pope Lucius II., in\r\nattempting to regain his temporal power, was slain with a stone in\r\nattacking it. Here Petrarch received his laurel crown (1341); and here\r\nthe tribune Rienzi promulgated the laws of the \"good estate.\" At this\r\ntime nothing existed on the Capitol but the church and convent of\r\nAra-Cœli, and a few ruins. Yet the cry of the people at the\r\ncoronation of Petrarch, \"Long life to _the Capitol_ and the poet!\" shows\r\nthat the scene itself was then still more present to their minds than\r\nthe principal actor upon it. But, when the popes returned from Avignon,\r\nthe very memory of the Capitol seemed effaced, and the spot was only\r\nknown as the Goat's Hill,--_Monte Caprino_. Pope Boniface IX. (1389--94)\r\nwas the first to erect on the Capitol, on the ruins of the Tabularium, a\r\nresidence for the senator and his assessors, Paul III. (1544--50)\r\nemployed Michael Angelo to lay out the Piazza del Campidoglio; when he\r\ndesigned the Capitoline Museum and the Palace of the Conservators. Pius\r\nIV., Gregory XIII., and Sixtus V. added the sculptures and other\r\nmonuments which now adorn the steps and balustrade.[36]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJust beyond the end of the Corso, the _Via della Pedacchia_ turns to the\r\nright, under a quaint archway in the secret passage constructed as a\r\nmeans of escape for the Franciscan Generals of Ara-Cœli to the\r\nPalazzo Venezia, as that in the Borgo is for the escape of the popes to\r\nS. Angelo. In this street is a house decorated with simple but elegant\r\nDoric details, and bearing an inscription over the door which shows that\r\nit was that of Pietro da Cortona.\r\n\r\nThe street ends in the sunny open space at the foot of the Capitol, with\r\nAra-Cœli on its left, approached by an immense flight of steps,\r\nremoved hither from the Temple of the Sun, on the Quirinal, but marking\r\nthe site of the famous staircase to the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,\r\nwhich Julius Cæsar descended on his knees, after his triumph for his\r\nGallic victories.[37]\r\n\r\nThe grand staircase, \"_La Cordonnata_,\" was opened in its present form\r\non the occasion of the entry of Charles V., in 1536.[38] At its foot are\r\ntwo lions of Egyptian porphyry, which were removed hither from the\r\nChurch of S. Stefano in Cacco, by Pius IV. It was down the staircase\r\nwhich originally existed on this site, that Rienzi the tribune fled in\r\nhis last moments, and close to the spot where the left-hand lion stands,\r\nthat he fell, covered with wounds, his wife witnessing his death from a\r\nwindow of the burning palace above. A small space between the two\r\nstaircases has lately been transformed into a garden, through which\r\naccess may be obtained to four vaulted brick chambers, remnants of the\r\nsubstructions of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. A living wolf is\r\nkept here in commemoration of the nurse of Romulus and Remus.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the stairs are colossal statues of the twin heroes,\r\nCastor and Pollux (brought hither from the Ghetto), commemorating the\r\nvictory of the Lake Regillus, after which they rode before the army to\r\nRome, to announce the joyful news, watered their horses at the Aqua\r\nArgentina, and then passed away from the gaze of the multitude into\r\ncelestial spheres. Beyond these, on either side, are two trophies of\r\nimperial times discovered in the ruin on the Esquiline, misnamed the\r\nTrophies of Marius. Next come statues of Constantine the Great and his\r\nson Constantine II., from their baths on the Quirinal. The two ends of\r\nthe parapet are occupied by ancient Milliaria, being the first and\r\nseventh milestones of the Appian Way. The first milestone was found in\r\n_situ_, and showed that the miles counted from the gates of Rome, and\r\nnot, as was formerly supposed, from the Milliarium Aureum, at the foot\r\nof the Capitol.\r\n\r\nWe now find ourselves in the _Piazza del Campidoglio_, occupying the\r\nIntermontium, where Brutus harangued the people after the murder of\r\nJulius Cæsar. In the centre of the square is the famous _Statue of\r\nMarcus Aurelius_, the only perfect ancient equestrian statue in\r\nexistence. It was originally gilt, as may still be seen from marks of\r\ngilding upon the figure, and stood in front of the arch of\r\nSeptimius-Severus. Hence it was removed by Sergius III. to the front of\r\nthe Lateran, where, not long after, it was put to a singular use by John\r\nXIII., who hung a refractory prefect of the city from it by his\r\nhair.[39] During the rejoicings consequent upon the elevation of Rienzi\r\nto the tribuneship in 1347, one of its nostrils was made to flow with\r\nwater and the other with wine. From its vicinity to the Lateran, so\r\nintimately connected with the history of Constantine, it was supposed\r\nduring the middle ages to represent that Christian emperor, and this\r\nfortunate error alone preserved it from the destruction which befell so\r\nmany other ancient imperial statues. Michael Angelo, when he designed\r\nthe buildings of the Capitoline Piazza, wished to remove the statue to\r\nits present site, but the canons of the Lateran were unwilling to part\r\nwith their treasure, and only consented to its removal upon an annual\r\nacknowledgment of their proprietorship, for which a bunch of flowers is\r\nstill presented once a year by the senators to the chapter of the\r\nLateran. Michael Angelo, standing in fixed admiration before this\r\nstatue, is said to have bidden the horse \"Cammina.\" Even until late\r\nyears an especial guardian has been appointed to take care of it, with\r\nan annual stipend of ten scudi a year, and the title of \"Il custode del\r\nCavallo.\"\r\n\r\n     \"They stood awhile to contemplate the bronze equestrian statue of\r\n     Marcus Aurelius. The moonlight glistened upon traces of the gilding\r\n     which had once covered both rider and steed; these were almost\r\n     gone, but the aspect of dignity was still perfect, clothing the\r\n     figure as it were with an imperial robe of light. It is the most\r\n     majestic representation of the kingly character that ever the world\r\n     has seen. A sight of the old heathen emperor is enough to create an\r\n     evanescent sentiment of loyalty even in a democratic bosom, so\r\n     august does he look, so fit to rule, so worthy of man's profoundest\r\n     homage and obedience, so inevitably attractive of his love. He\r\n     stretches forth his hand with an air of proud magnificence and\r\n     unlimited authority, as if uttering a decree from which no appeal\r\n     was permissible, but in which the obedient subject would find his\r\n     highest interests consulted: a command that was in itself a\r\n     benediction.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\n     \"I often ascend the Capitoline Hill to look at Marcus Aurelius and\r\n     his horse, and have not been able to refrain from caressing the\r\n     lions of basalt. You cannot stand on the Aventine or the Palatine\r\n     without grave thoughts, but standing on the spot brings me very\r\n     little nearer the image of past ages.\"--_Niebuhr's Letters._\r\n\r\n     \"La statue équestre de Marc-Aurèle a aussi sa légende, et celle-là\r\n     n'est pas du moyen âge, mais elle a été recueillie il y a peu\r\n     d'années de la bouche d'un jeune Romain. La dorure, en partie\r\n     détruite, se voit encore en quelques endroits. A en croire le jeune\r\n     Romain, cependant, la dorure, au lieu d'aller s'effaçant toujours\r\n     davantage, était en voie de progrès. 'Voyez, disait-il, la statue\r\n     de bronze commence à se dorer, et quand elle le sera entièrement,\r\n     le monde finira.'--C'est toujours, sous une forme absurde, la\r\n     vieille idée romaine, que les destinées et l'existence de Rome sont\r\n     liées aux destinées et à l'existence du monde. C'est ce qui faisait\r\n     dire au septième siècle; ainsi que les pèlerins saxons l'avaient\r\n     entendu et le répétaient; 'Quand le Colisée tombera, Rome et le\r\n     monde finiront.'\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 228.\r\n\r\nThe building at the back of the piazza is _The Palace of the Senator_,\r\noriginally built by Boniface IX. (1389), but altered by Michael Angelo\r\nto correspond with his buildings on either side. The fountain at the\r\nfoot of the double staircase was erected by Sixtus V., and is adorned\r\nwith statues of river gods found in the Colonna Gardens, and a curious\r\nporphyry figure of Minerva--adapted as Rome. The body of this statue\r\nwas found at Cori, but the head and arms are modern additions.\r\n\r\n     \"Rome personnifiée, cette déesse à laquelle on érigea des temples,\r\n     voulut d'abord être une Amazone, ce qui se conçoit, car elle était\r\n     guerrière avant tout. C'est sous la forme de Minerve que Rome est\r\n     assise sur la place du Capitole.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Romaine_, iii.\r\n     242.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of this building the Hall of the Senators contains some\r\npapal statues, and that of Charles of Anjou, who was made senator of\r\nRome in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe _Tower of the Capitol_ contains the great bell of Viterbo, carried\r\noff from that town during the wars of the middle ages, which is never\r\nrung except to announce the death of a pope, or the opening of the\r\ncarnival. During the closing years of the temporal power of the popes,\r\nit has been difficult to obtain admission to the tower, but the ascent\r\nis well repaid by the view from the summit, which embraces not only the\r\nseven hills of Rome, but the various towns and villages of the\r\nneighbouring plain and mountains which successively fell under its\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\n     \"Pour suivre les vicissitudes des luttes extérieures des Romains\r\n     contre les peuples qui les entourent et les pressent de tous côtés,\r\n     nous n'aurons qu'à regarder à l'horizon la sublime campagne romaine\r\n     et ces montagnes qui l'encadrent si admirablement. Elles sont\r\n     encore plus belles et l'œil prend encore plus de plaisir à les\r\n     contempler quand on songe à ce qu'elles ont vu d'efforts et de\r\n     courage dans les premiers temps de la république. Il n'est presque\r\n     pas un point de cette campagne qui n'ait été témoin de quelque\r\n     rencontre glorieuse; il n'est presque un rocher de ces montagnes\r\n     qui n'est été pris et repris vingt fois.\r\n\r\n     \"Toutes ces nations sabelliques qui dominaient la ville du Tibre et\r\n     semblaient placées là sur des hauteurs disposées en demi-cercle\r\n     pour l'envelopper et l'écraser, toutes ces nations sont devant nous\r\n     et à la portée du regard.\r\n\r\n     \"Voici de côté de la mer les montagnes des Volsques; plus à l'est\r\n     sont les Herniques et les Æques; au nord, les Sabins; à l'ouest,\r\n     d'autres ennemis, les Etrusques, dont le mont Ciminus est le\r\n     rempart.\r\n\r\n     \"Au sud, la plaine se prolonge jusqu'à la mer.

Rom._ ii. 373.\r\n\r\nBeneath the Palace of the Senator (entered by a door in the street on\r\nthe right), are the gigantic remains of the _Tabularium_, consisting of\r\nhuge rectangular blocks of peperino supporting a Doric colonnade, which\r\nis shown by an inscription still preserved to have been that of the\r\npublic Record Office, where the Tabulæ, engraved plates bearing\r\nimportant decrees of the Senate, were preserved, having been placed\r\nthere by Q. Lutatius Catulus in B.C. 79. A gallery in the interior of\r\nthe Tabularium has been fitted up as a museum of architectural\r\nantiquities collected from the neighbouring temples. This building is as\r\nit were the boundary between inhabited Rome and that Rome which is a\r\ncity of ruins.\r\n\r\n     \"I came to the Capitol, and looked down on the other side. There\r\n     before my eyes opened an immense grave, and out of the grave rose a\r\n     city of monuments in ruins, columns, triumphal arches, temples, and\r\n     palaces, broken, ruinous, but still beautiful and grand,--with a\r\n     solemn mournful beauty! It was the giant apparition of ancient\r\n     Rome.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\nThe traces of an ancient staircase still exist, which led down from the\r\nTabularium to the Forum. This is believed by many to have been the path\r\nby which the besiegers under Vitellius, A.D. 69, attacked the Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe east side of the piazza--on the left as one stands at the head of\r\nthe steps--is the _Museo Capitolino_ (open daily from 9 to 4, for a\r\nfee; and on Mondays and Thursdays gratis, from 2½ to 4½).\r\n\r\nAbove the fountain in the court, opposite the entrance, reclines the\r\ncolossal statue of a river-god, called Marforio, removed hither from the\r\nend of the Via di Marforio (Forum Martis?) near the arch of Severus.\r\nThis figure, according to Roman fancy, was the friend and gossip of\r\nPasquin (at the Palazzo Braschi), and lively dialogues, merciless to the\r\nfollies of the government and the times, used to appear with early\r\nmorning, placarded on their respective pedestals, as passing between the\r\ntwo. Thus, when Clement XI. mulcted Rome of numerous sums to send to his\r\nnative Urbino, Marforio asked, \"What is Pasquino doing?\" The next\r\nmorning Pasquin answered, \"I am taking care of Rome, that it does not go\r\naway to Urbino.\" In the desire of putting an end to such inconvenient\r\nremarks, the government ordered the removal of one of the statues to the\r\nCapitol, and, since Marforio has been shut up, Pasquino has lost his\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nFrom the corridor on the ground floor open several rooms devoted to\r\nancient inscriptions and sarcophagi with bas-reliefs. The first room on\r\nthe left has some bronzes--in the centre a mutilated horse, found, 1849,\r\nin the Trastevere.\r\n\r\n     \"Calamis, venu un peu avant Phidias, n'eut point de rival pour les\r\n     chevaux.

The first is named\r\nthe _Room of the Doves_, from the famous mosaic found in the ruins of\r\nHadrian's villa near Tivoli, and generally called _Pliny's Doves_,\r\nbecause Pliny, when speaking of the perfection to which the mosaic art\r\nhad attained, describes a wonderful mosaic of Sosus of Pergamos, in\r\nwhich one dove is seen drinking and casting her shadow on the water,\r\nwhile others are pluming themselves on the edge of the vase. As a\r\npendant to this is another _Mosaic, of a Tragic and Comic Mask_. In the\r\nfarther window is the _Iliac Tablet_, an interesting relief in the soft\r\nmarble called palombino, relating to the story of the destruction of\r\nTroy, and the flight of Æneas, and found at Bovillæ.\r\n\r\n     \"L'ensemble de la guerre contre Troie est contenu dans un abrégé\r\n     figuré qu'on appelle la Table Iliaque, petit bas-relief destiné à\r\n     offrir un résumé visible de cette guerre aux jeunes Romains, et à\r\n     servir dans les écoles soit pour l'_Iliade_, soit pour les poëmes\r\n     cycliques comme d'un _Index parlant_.\r\n\r\n     \"La Table Iliaque est un ouvrage romain fait à Rome.

It stands on an altar dedicated to Serapis. Against the right\r\nwall is a magnificent sarcophagus, whose reliefs (much studied by\r\nFlaxman) represent the battle of Theseus and the Amazons. The opposite\r\nsarcophagus has a relief of Diana and Endymion. We should also notice--\r\n\r\n15. A boy with a mask.\r\n\r\n21. A boy with a goose (found near the Lateran).\r\n\r\nLet into the wall is a black tablet--the Lex Regia, or\r\nSenatus-Consultum, conferring imperial powers upon Vespasian, being the\r\nvery table upon which Rienzi declaimed in favour of the rights of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Hall of the Dying Gladiator_ contains the three gems of the\r\ncollection--\"the Gladiator,\" \"the Antinous of the Capitol,\" and the\r\n\"Faun of Praxiteles.\" Besides these, we should notice--2. Apollo with\r\nthe lyre, and 9. a bust of M. Junius Brutus, the assassin of Julius\r\nCæsar.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the room is the grand statue of the wounded Gaul,\r\ngenerally known as the Dying Gladiator.\r\n\r\n    \"I see before me the gladiator lie:\r\n    He leans upon his hand--his manly brow\r\n    Consents to death, but conquers agony,\r\n    And his drooped head sinks gradually low,--\r\n    And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow\r\n    From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,\r\n    Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now\r\n    The arena swims around him--he is gone,\r\n    Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.\r\n\r\n    \"He heard it, but he heeded not--his eyes\r\n    Were with his heart, and that was far away;\r\n    He reck'd not of the life he lost, nor prize,\r\n    But where his rude hut by the Danube lay\r\n    There were his young barbarians all at play,\r\n    There was their Dacian mother--he, their sire,\r\n    Butchered to make a Roman holiday.\r\n    All this rushed with his blood--shall he expire,\r\n    And unavenged? Arise, ye Goths, and glut your ire!\"\r\n\r\n    _Byron, Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nIt is delightful to read in this room the description in\r\n_Transformation_:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was that room in the centre of which reclines the noble and\r\n     most pathetic figure of the dying gladiator, just sinking into his\r\n     death-swoon. Around the walls stand the Antinous, the Amazon, the\r\n     Lycian Apollo, the Juno; all famous productions of antique\r\n     sculpture, and still shining in the undiminished majesty and beauty\r\n     of their ideal life, although the marble that embodies them is\r\n     yellow with time, and perhaps corroded by the damp earth in which\r\n     they lay buried for centuries. Here, likewise, is seen a symbol (as\r\n     apt at this moment as it was two thousand years ago) of the Human\r\n     Soul, with its choice of Innocence or Evil close at hand, in the\r\n     pretty figure of a child, clasping a dove to her bosom, but\r\n     assaulted by a snake.\r\n\r\n     \"From one of the windows of this saloon, we may see a broad flight\r\n     of stone steps, descending alongside the antique and massive\r\n     foundation of the Capitol, towards the battered triumphal arch of\r\n     Septimius Severus, right below. Farther on, the eye skirts along\r\n     the edge of the desolate Forum (where Roman washerwomen hang out\r\n     their linen to the sun), passing over a shapeless confusion of\r\n     modern edifices, piled rudely up with ancient brick and stone, and\r\n     over the domes of Christian churches, built on the old pavements\r\n     of heathen temples, and supported by the very pillars that once\r\n     upheld them. At a distance beyond--yet but a little way,\r\n     considering how much history is heaped into the intervening\r\n     space--rises the great sweep of the Coliseum, with the blue sky\r\n     brightening through its upper tier of arches. Far off, the view is\r\n     shut in by the Alban mountains, looking just the same, amid all\r\n     this decay and change, as when Romulus gazed thitherward over his\r\n     half-finished wall.\r\n\r\n     \"In this chamber is the Faun of Praxiteles. It is the marble image\r\n     of a young man, leaning his right arm on the trunk or stump of a\r\n     tree: one hand hangs carelessly by his side, in the other he holds\r\n     a fragment of a pipe, or some such sylvan instrument of music. His\r\n     only garment, a lion's skin with the claws upon the shoulder, falls\r\n     half-way down his back, leaving his limbs and entire front of the\r\n     figure nude. The form, thus displayed, is marvellously graceful,\r\n     but has a fuller and more rounded outline, more flesh, and less of\r\n     heroic muscle, than the old sculptors were wont to assign to their\r\n     types of masculine beauty. The character of the face corresponds\r\n     with the figure; it is most agreeable in outline and feature, but\r\n     rounded and somewhat voluptuously developed, especially about the\r\n     throat and chin; the nose is almost straight, but very slightly\r\n     curves inward, thereby acquiring an indescribable charm of\r\n     geniality and humour. The mouth, with its full yet delicate lips,\r\n     seems so really to smile outright, that it calls forth a responsive\r\n     smile. The whole statue--unlike anything else that ever was wrought\r\n     in the severe material of marble--conveys the idea of an amiable\r\n     and sensual creature, easy, mirthful, apt for jollity, yet not\r\n     incapable of being touched by pathos. It is impossible to gaze long\r\n     at this stone image, without conceiving a kindly sentiment towards\r\n     it, as if its substance were warm to the touch, and imbued with\r\n     actual life. It comes very near to some of our pleasantest\r\n     sympathies.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\n     \"Praxitèle avait dit à Phryné de choisir entre ses ouvrages celui\r\n     qu'elle aimerait le mieux. Pour savoir lequel de ses\r\n     chefs-d'œuvre l'artiste préférait, elle lui fit annoncer que le\r\n     feu avait pris à son atelier. 'Sauvez, s'écria-t-il, mon Satyre et\r\n     mon Amour!'\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 309.\r\n\r\nThe west or right side of the Capitoline Piazza is occupied by _the\r\nPalace of the Conservators_, which contains the Protomoteca, the Picture\r\nGallery, and various other treasures.\r\n\r\nThe little court at the entrance is full of historical relics, including\r\nremains of two gigantic statues of Apollo; a colossal head of Domitian;\r\nand the marble pedestal, which once in the mausoleum of Augustus\r\nsupported the cinerary urn of Agrippina, wife of Germanicus, with a very\r\nperfect inscription. In the opposite loggia are a statue of Rome\r\nTriumphant, and a group of a lion attacking a horse, found in the bed of\r\nthe Almo. In the portico on the right is the only authentic statue of\r\nJulius Cæsar; on the left, a statue of Augustus, leaning against the\r\nrostrum of a galley, in allusion to the battle of Actium.\r\n\r\n_The Protomoteca_, a suite of eight rooms on the ground floor, contains\r\na collection of busts of eminent Italians, with a few foreigners\r\nconsidered as naturalised by a long residence in Rome. Those in the\r\nsecond room, representing artists of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth centuries, were entirely executed at the expense of Canova.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the staircase is a restoration by Michael Angelo of the\r\ncolumn of Caius Duilius. On the upper flight of the staircase is a\r\nbas-relief of Curtius leaping into the gulf, here represented as a\r\nmarsh.\r\n\r\n     \"Un bas-relief d'un travail ancien, dont le style ressemble à celui\r\n     des figures peintes sur les vases dits archaïques, représente\r\n     Curtius engagé dans son marais; le cheval baisse la tête et flaire\r\n     le marécage, qui est indiqué par des roseaux. Le guerrier penché en\r\n     avant, presse sa monture. On a vivement, en présence de cette\r\n     curieuse sculpture, le sentiment d'un incident héroïque\r\n     probablement réel, et en même temps de l'aspect primitif du lieu\r\n     qui en fut témoin.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom. i. 321._\r\n\r\nOn the first and second landings are magnificent reliefs, representing\r\nevents in the life of Marcus Aurelius, Imp., belonging to the arch\r\ndedicated to him, which was wantonly destroyed, in order to widen the\r\nCorso, by Alexander VII.\r\n\r\n     \"Jusqu'au lègne de Commode Rome est représentée par une Amazone;\r\n     dans l'escalier du palais des Conservateurs, Rome, en tunique\r\n     courte d'Amazone et le globe à la main, reçoit Marc Aurèle; le\r\n     globe dans la main de Rome date de César.\"--_Ampère_, iii. 242.\r\n\r\n_The Halls of the Conservators_ consist of eight rooms. The 1st, painted\r\nin fresco from the history of the Roman kings, by the _Cavaliere\r\nd'Arpino_, contains statues of Urban VIII., by Bernini; Leo X., by the\r\nSicilian Giacomo della Duca;[41] and Innocent X., in bronze, by Algardi.\r\nThe 2nd room, adorned with subjects from republican history by\r\n_Lauretti_, has statues of modern Roman generals--Marc Antonio Colonna,\r\nTommaso Rospigliosi, Francesco Aldobrandini, Carlo Barberini, brother of\r\nUrban VIII., and Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma. The 3rd room,\r\npainted by _Daniele di Volterra_, with subjects from the wars with the\r\nCimbri, contains the famous _Bronze Wolf of the Capitol_, one of the\r\nmost interesting relics in the city. The figure of the wolf is of\r\nunknown antiquity; those of Romulus and Remus are modern. It has been\r\ndoubted whether this is the wolf described by Dionysius as \"an ancient\r\nwork of brass\" standing in the temple of Romulus under the Palatine, or\r\nthe wolf described by Cicero, who speaks of a little gilt figure of the\r\nfounder of the city sucking the teats of a wolf. The Ciceronian wolf was\r\nstruck by lightning in the time of the great orator, and a fracture in\r\nthe existing figure, attributed to lightning, is adduced in proof of its\r\nidentity with it.\r\n\r\n              \"Geminos huic ubera circum\r\n    Ludere pendentes pueros, et lambere matrem\r\n    Impavidos: illam tereti cervice reflexam\r\n    Mulcere alternos, et corpora fingere lingua.\"\r\n\r\n    _Virgil, Æn._ viii. 632.\r\n\r\n    \"And thou, the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome!\r\n    She-wolf! whose brazen-imaged dugs impart\r\n    The milk of conquest yet within the dome\r\n    Where, as a monument of antique art,\r\n    Thou standest:--mother of the mighty heart,\r\n    Which the great founder sucked from thy wild teat,\r\n    Scorch'd by the Roman Jove's ethereal dart,\r\n    And thy limbs black with lightning--dost thou yet\r\n    Guard thy immortal cubs, nor thy fond charge forget?\"\r\n\r\n    _Byron, Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nStanding near the wolf is the well-known and beautiful figure of a boy\r\nextracting a thorn from his foot, called the Shepherd Martius.\r\n\r\n     \"La ressemblance du type si fin de l'Apollon au lézard et du\r\n     charmant bronze du Capitole _le tíreur d'épine_ est trop frappante\r\n     pour qu'on puisse se refuser à voir dans celui-ci une inspiration\r\n     de Praxitèle ou de son école. C'est tout simplement un enfant\r\n     arrachant de son pied une épine qui l'a blessé, sujet naïf et\r\n     champêtre analogue au Satyre se faisant rendre ce service par un\r\n     autre Satyre. On a voulu y voir un athlète blessé par une épine\r\n     pendant sa course et qui n'en est pas moins arrivé au but; mais la\r\n     figure est trop jeune et n'a rien d'athlétique. Le moyen âge avait\r\n     donné aussi son explication et inventé sa legende. On raccontait\r\n     qu'un jeune berger, envoyé à la découverte de l'ennemi, était\r\n     revenu sans s'arrêter et ne s'était permis qu'alors d'arracher une\r\n     épine qui lui blessait le pied. Le moyen âge avait senti le charme\r\n     de cette composition qu'il interprétait à sa manière, car elle est\r\n     sculptée sur un arceau de la cathédrale de Zurich qui date du\r\n     siècle de Charlemagne.\"--_Ampère_, iii. 315.\r\n\r\nForming part of the decorations of this room are two fine pictures, a\r\ndead Christ with a monk praying, and Sta. Francesca Romana, by\r\n_Romanelli_. Near the door of exit is a bust said to be that of Junius\r\nBrutus.\r\n\r\n     \"Il est permis de voir dans le buste du Capitole un vrai portrait\r\n     de Brutus; il est difficile d'en douter en le contemplant. Voilà\r\n     bien le visage farouche, la barbe _hirsute_, les cheveux roides\r\n     collés si rudement sur le front, la physiognomie inculte et\r\n     terrible du prémier consul romain; la bouche serrée respire la\r\n     détermination et l'énergie; les yeux, formés d'une matière\r\n     jaunâtre, se détachent en clair sur le bronze noirci par les\r\n     siècles et vous jettent un regard fixe et farouche. Tout près est\r\n     la louve de bronze. Brutus est de la même famille. On sent qu'il y\r\n     a du lait de cette louve dans les veines du second fondateur de\r\n     Rome, comme dans les veines du premier, et que lui aussi, pareil au\r\n     Romulus de la légende, marchera vers son but à travers le sang des\r\n     siens.\r\n\r\n     \"Le buste de Brutus est placé sur un piédestal qui le met à la\r\n     hauteur du regard. Là, dans un coin sombre, j'ai passé bien des\r\n     moments face à face avec l'impitoyable fondateur de la liberté\r\n     romaine.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ ii. 270.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Room contains the _Fasti Consulares_, tables found near the\r\ntemple of Minerva Chalcidica, and inscribed with the names of public\r\nofficers from Romulus to Augustus. The 5th Room contains two bronze\r\nducks (formerly shown as the sacred geese of the Capitol) and a female\r\nhead--found in the gardens of Sallust, a bust of Medusa, by _Bernini_,\r\nand many others. The 6th, or Throne Room, hung with faded tapestry, has\r\na frieze in fresco, by _Annibale Caracci_, representing the triumphs of\r\nScipio Africanus. The 7th Room is painted by _Daniele da Volterra_(?)\r\nwith the history of the Punic Wars. The 8th Room (now used as a passage)\r\nis a chapel, containing a lovely fresco, by _Pinturicchio_, of the\r\nMadonna and Child with Angels.\r\n\r\n     \"The Madonna is seated enthroned, fronting the spectator; her large\r\n     mantle forms a grand cast of drapery; the child on her lap sleeps\r\n     in the loveliest attitude; she folds her hands and looks down,\r\n     quiet, serious, and beautiful: in the clouds are two adoring\r\n     angels.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nThe four Evangelists are by _Caravaggio_; the pictures of Roman saints\r\n(Cecilia, Alexis, Eustachio, Francesca-Romana), by _Romanelli_.\r\n\r\nBy the same staircase, passing on the left a wonderful relief of the\r\napotheosis of the wicked Faustina, we may arrive at the _Picture Gallery\r\nof the Capitol_ (which can also be approached by a separate staircase,\r\nentered from an alley at the back of the building), reached by two rooms\r\ninscribed with the names of the Roman Conservators from the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century. This gallery contains very few first-rate\r\npictures, but has a beautiful St. Sebastian, by Guido, and several fine\r\nworks of _Guercino_. The most noticeable pictures are--\r\n\r\n_1st Room._--\r\n\r\n     2. Disembodied Spirit (unfinished): _Guido Reni_.\r\n    13. St. John Baptist: _Guercino_.\r\n    16.

An enormous picture, brought hither\r\n         from St. Peter's, where it has been replaced by a mosaic copy. The\r\n         composition is divided into two parts. The lower represents the\r\n         burial of Sta. Petronilla, the upper the ascension of her spirit.\r\n\r\n\"The Apostle Peter had a daughter, born in lawful wedlock, who\r\naccompanied him in his journey from the East. Petronilla was wonderfully\r\nfair; and Valerius Flaccus, a young and noble Roman, who was a heathen,\r\nbecame enamoured of her beauty, and sought her for his wife; and he,\r\nbeing very powerful, she feared to refuse him; she therefore desired him\r\nto return in three days, and promised that he should then carry her\r\nhome. But she prayed earnestly to be delivered from this peril; and when\r\nFlaccus returned in three days, with great pomp, to celebrate the\r\nmarriage, he found her dead. The company of nobles who attended him,\r\ncarried her to the grave, in which they laid her, crowned with roses;\r\nand Flaccus lamented greatly.\"--_Mrs. Jameson, from the Perfetto\r\nLegendario._\r\n\r\n199. Death and Assumption of the Virgin: _Cola della Matrice_.\r\n\r\n\"Here the death of the Virgin is treated at once in a mystical and\r\ndramatic style. Enveloped in a dark blue mantle, spangled with golden\r\nstars, she lies extended on a couch; St. Peter, in a splendid scarlet\r\ncope as bishop, reads the service; St. John, holding the palm, weeps\r\nbitterly. In front, and kneeling before the couch or bier, appear the\r\nthree great Dominican saints as witnesses of the religious mystery; in\r\nthe centre St. Dominic; on the left, St. Catherine of Siena; and on the\r\nright, St. Thomas Aquinas. In a compartment above is the\r\nAssumption.\"--_Jameson's Legends of the Madonna_, p. 315.\r\n\r\n    123. Virgin and Angels: _Paul Veronese_.\r\n    124. Rape of Europa: _Paul Veronese_.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Capitol steps, to the right of the terrace, is the\r\nentrance to the _Palazzo Caffarelli_, the residence of the Prussian\r\nminister. It has a small but beautiful garden, and the view from the\r\nwindows is magnificent.\r\n\r\n     \"After dinner, Bunsen called for us, and took us first to his house\r\n     on the Capitol, the different windows of which command the\r\n     different views of ancient and modern Rome. Never shall I forget\r\n     the view of the former; we looked down on the Forum, and just\r\n     opposite were the Palatine and the Aventine, with the ruins of the\r\n     Palace of the Cæsars on the one, and houses intermixed with gardens\r\n     on the other. The mass of the Coliseum rose beyond the Forum, and\r\n     beyond all, the wide plain of the Campagna to the sea. On the left\r\n     rose the Alban hills, bright in the setting sun, which played full\r\n     upon Frescati and Albano, and the trees which edge the lake, and\r\n     further away in the distance, it lit up the old town of\r\n     Labicum.\"--_Arnold's Letters._\r\n\r\nFrom the further end of the courtyard of the Caffarelli Palace one can\r\nlook down upon part of the bare cliff of the Rupe Tarpeia. Here there\r\nexisted till 1868 a small court, which is represented as the scene of\r\nthe murder in Hawthorne's Marble Faun, or \"Transformation.\" The door,\r\nthe niche in the wall, and all other details mentioned in the novel,\r\nwere realities. The character of the place is now changed by the removal\r\nof the boundary-wall. The part of the rock seen from here is that\r\nusually visited from below by the Via Tor de' Specchi.\r\n\r\nTo reach the principal portion of the south-eastern height of the\r\nCapitol, we must ascend the staircase beyond the Palace of the\r\nConservators, on the right. Here we shall find ourselves upon the\r\nhighest part of\r\n\r\n              \"The Tarpeian rock, the citadel\r\n    Of great and glorious Rome, queen of the earth,\r\n    So far renown'd, and with the spoils enriched\r\n    Of nations.\"\r\n          _Paradise Regained._\r\n\r\n                          \"The steep\r\n    Tarpeian, fittest goal of treason's race,\r\n    The promontory whence the traitor's leap\r\n    Cured all ambition.\"\r\n         _Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nThe dirty lane, with its shabby houses, and grass-grown spaces, and\r\nfilthy children, has little to remind one of the appearance of the hill\r\nas seen by Virgil and Propertius, who speak of the change in their time\r\nfrom an earlier aspect.\r\n\r\n    \"Hinc ad Tarpeiam sedem, et Capitolia ducit,\r\n    Aurea nunc, olim, silvestribus horrida dumis,\r\n    Jam tum religio pavidos terrebat agrestes\r\n    Dira loci; jam tum silvam saxumque tremebant.\"\r\n                _Virgil, Æn._ viii. 347.\r\n\r\n    \"Hoc quodcumque vides, hospes, qua maxima Roma est,\r\n    Ante Phrygem Aeneam collis et herba fuit.\"\r\n                _Propertius_, iv. eleg. I.\r\n\r\nIt was on this side that the different attacks were made upon the\r\nCapitol. The first was by the Sabine Herdonius at the head of a band of\r\nslaves, who scaled the heights and surprised the garrison, in B.C. 460,\r\nand from the heights of the citadel proclaimed freedom to all slaves who\r\nshould join him, with abolition of debts, and defence of the plebs from\r\ntheir oppressors; but his offers were disregarded, and on the fourth day\r\nthe Capitol was re-taken, and he was slain with nearly all his\r\nfollowers. The second attack was by the Gauls, who, according to the\r\nwell-known story, climbed the rock near the Porta Carmentale, and had\r\nnearly reached the summit unobserved--for the dogs neglected to\r\nbark--when the cries of the sacred geese of Juno aroused an officer\r\nnamed Manlius, who rushed to the defence, and hurled over the precipice\r\nthe first assailant, who dragged down others in his fall, and thus the\r\nCapitol was saved. In remembrance of this incident, a goose was\r\nannually carried in triumph, and a dog annually crucified upon the\r\nCapitol, between the temple of Summanus and that of Youth.[42] This was\r\nthe same Manlius, the friend of the people, who was afterwards condemned\r\nby the patricians on pretext that he wished to make himself king, and\r\nthrown from the Tarpeian rock, on the same spot, in sight of the Forum,\r\nwhere Spurius Cassius, an ex-consul, had been thrown down before. To\r\nvisit the part of the rock from which these executions must have taken\r\nplace, it is necessary to enter a little garden near the German\r\nHospital, whence there is a beautiful view of the river and the\r\nAventine.\r\n\r\n     \"Quand on veut visiter la roche Tarpéienne, on sonne à une porte de\r\n     peu d'apparence, sur laquelle sont écrits ces mots: _Rocca\r\n     Tarpeia_. Une pauvre femme arrive et vous mène dans un carré de\r\n     choux. C'est de là qu'on précipita Manlius. Je serais desolé que le\r\n     carré de choux manquât.\"--_Ampère, Portraits de Rome._\r\n\r\nThis side of the Intermontium is now generally known as _Monte Caprino_,\r\na name which Ampère derives from the fact that Vejovis, the Etruscan\r\nideal of Jupiter, was always represented with a goat.[43] On this side\r\nof the hill, the viaduct from the Palatine, built by Caligula (who\r\naffected to require it to facilitate communication with his friend\r\nJupiter), joined the Capitoline.\r\n\r\nWe have still to examine the north-eastern height, the site of the most\r\ninteresting of pagan temples, now occupied by one of the most\r\ninteresting of Christian churches. The name of the famous _Church of\r\nAra-Cœli_ is generally attributed to an altar erected by Augustus to\r\ncommemorate the Delphic oracle respecting the coming of our Saviour,\r\nwhich is still recognised in the well-known hymn of the Church:\r\n\r\n    Teste David cum Sibylla.[44]\r\n\r\nThe altar bore the inscription \"Ara Primogeniti Dei.\" Those who seek a\r\nmore humble origin for the church, say that the name merely dates from\r\nmediæval times, when it was called \"Sta, Maria in Aurocœlio.\" It\r\noriginally belonged to the Benedictine Order, but was transferred to the\r\nFranciscans by Innocent IV. in 1252, since which time its convent has\r\noccupied an important position as the residence of the General of the\r\nMinor Franciscans (Grey-friars), and is the centre of religious life in\r\nthat Order.\r\n\r\nThe staircase on the left of the Senators' palace, which leads to the\r\nside entrance of Ara-Cœli, is in itself full of historical\r\nassociations. It was at its head that Valerius the consul was killed in\r\nthe conflict with Herdonius for the possession of the Capitol. It was\r\ndown the ancient steps on this site that Annius, the envoy of the\r\nLatins, fell (B.C. 340), and was nearly killed, after his audacious\r\nproposition in the temple of Jupiter, that the Latins and Romans should\r\nbecome one nation, and have a common senate and consuls. Here also,[45]\r\nin B.C. 133, Tiberius Gracchus was knocked down with the leg of a chair,\r\nand killed in front of the temple of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIt is at the top of these steps, that the monks of Ara-Cœli, who are\r\ncelebrated as dentists, perform their hideous, but useful and gratuitous\r\noperations, which may be witnessed here every morning!\r\n\r\nOver the side entrance of Ara-Cœli is a beautiful mosaic of the\r\nVirgin and Child. This, with the ancient brick arches above, framing\r\nfragments of deep blue sky--and the worn steps below--forms a subject\r\ndear to Roman artists, and is often introduced as a background to groups\r\nof monks and peasants. The interior of the church is vast, solemn, and\r\nhighly picturesque. It was here, as Gibbon himself tells us, that on the\r\n15th of October, 1764, as he sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol,\r\nwhile the bare-footed friars were singing vespers, the idea of writing\r\nthe \"Decline and Fall\" of the city first started to his mind.\r\n\r\n     \"As we lift the great curtain and push into the church, a faint\r\n     perfume of incense salutes the nostrils. The golden sunset bursts\r\n     in as the curtain of the (west) door sways forward, illuminates the\r\n     mosaic floor, catches on the rich golden ceiling, and flashes here\r\n     and there over the crowd (gathered in Epiphany), on some brilliant\r\n     costume or closely shaven head. All sorts of people are thronging\r\n     there, some kneeling before the shrine of the Madonna, which gleams\r\n     with its hundreds of silver votive hearts, legs, and arms, some\r\n     listening to the preaching, some crowding round the chapel of the\r\n     _Presepio_. Old women, haggard and wrinkled, come tottering along\r\n     with their _scaldini_ of coals, drop down on their knees to pray,\r\n     and, as you pass, interpolate in their prayers a parenthesis of\r\n     begging. The church is not architecturally handsome, but it is\r\n     eminently picturesque, with its relics of centuries, its mosaic\r\n     pulpits and floors, its frescoes of Pinturicchio and Pesaro, its\r\n     antique columns, its rich golden ceiling, its gothic mausoleum to\r\n     the Savelli, and its mediæval tombs. A dim, dingy look is over\r\n     all--but it is the dimness of faded splendour; and one cannot stand\r\n     there, knowing the history of the church, its great antiquity, and\r\n     the varied fortunes it has known, without a peculiar sense of\r\n     interest and pleasure.\r\n\r\n     \"It was here that Romulus in the grey dawning of Rome built the\r\n     temple of Jupiter Feretrius. Here the _spolia opima_ were\r\n     deposited. Here the triumphal processions of the emperors and\r\n     generals ended. Here the victors paused before making their vows,\r\n     until, from the Mamertine prisons below, the message came to\r\n     announce that their noblest prisoner and victim--while the clang of\r\n     their triumph and his defeat rose ringing in his ears, as the\r\n     procession ascended the steps--had expiated with death the crime of\r\n     being the enemy of Rome. On the steps of Ara-Cœli, nineteen\r\n     centuries ago, the first great Cæsar climbed on his knees after\r\n     his first triumph. At their base, Rienzi, the last of the Roman\r\n     tribunes, fell--and if the tradition of the Church is to be\r\n     trusted, it was on the site of the present high altar that Augustus\r\n     erected the 'Ara Primogeniti Dei,' to commemorate the Delphic\r\n     prophecy of the coming of our Saviour. Standing on a spot so\r\n     thronged with memories, the dullest imagination takes fire. The\r\n     forms and scenes of the past rise from their graves and pass before\r\n     us, and the actual and visionary are mingled together in strange\r\n     poetic confusion.\"--_Roba di Roma_, i. 73.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the church is of the ancient mosaic known as Opus\r\nAlexandrinum. The nave is separated from the aisles by twenty-two\r\nancient columns, of which two are of cipollino, two of white marble, and\r\neighteen of Egyptian granite. They are of very different forms and\r\nsizes, and have probably been collected from various pagan edifices. The\r\ninscription \"A Cubiculo Augustorum\" upon the third column on the left of\r\nthe nave, shows that it was brought from the Palace of the Cæsars. The\r\nwindows in this church are amongst the few in Rome which show traces of\r\ngothic. At the end of the nave, on either side, are two ambones, marking\r\nthe position of the choir before it was extended to its present site in\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe transepts are full of interesting monuments. That on the right is\r\nthe burial-place of the great family of Savelli, and contains--on the\r\nleft, the monument of Luca Savelli, 1266 (father of Pope Honorius IV.)\r\nand his son Pandolfo,--an ancient and richly sculptured sarcophagus, to\r\nwhich a gothic canopy was added by _Agostino_ and _Agnolo da Siena_ from\r\ndesigns of Giotto. Opposite, is the tomb of the mother of Honorius, Vana\r\nAldobrandesca, upon which is the statue of the pope himself, removed\r\nfrom his monument in the old St. Peter's by Paul III.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the high altar is the tomb of Cardinal Gianbattista\r\nSavelli, ob. 1498, and near it--in the pavement, the half-effaced\r\ngravestone of Sigismondo Conti, whose features are so familiar to us\r\nfrom his portrait introduced into the famous picture of the Madonna di\r\nFoligno, which was painted by Raphael at his order, and presented by him\r\nto this church, where it remained over the high altar, till 1565, when\r\nhis great niece Anna became a nun at the convent of the Contesse at\r\nFoligno, and was allowed to carry it away with her. In the east transept\r\nis another fine gothic tomb, that of Cardinal Matteo di Acquasparta\r\n(1302), a General of the Franciscans mentioned by Dante for his wise and\r\nmoderate rule.[46] The quaint chapel in the middle of this transept, now\r\ndedicated to St. Helena, is supposed to occupy the site of the \"Ara\r\nPrimogeniti Dei.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the pier near the ambone of the gospel is the monument of Queen\r\nCatherine of Bosnia, who died at Rome in 1478, bequeathing her states to\r\nthe Roman Church on condition of their reversion to her son, who had\r\nembraced Mahommedanism, if he should return to the Catholic faith. Near\r\nthis, upon the transept wall, is the tomb of Felice de Fredis, ob. 1529,\r\nupon which it is recorded that he was the finder of the Laocoon. The\r\nChapel of the Annunciation, opening from the west isle, has a tomb to G.\r\nCrivelli, by Donatello, bearing his signature, \"Opus Donatelli\r\nFlorentini.\" The Chapel of Santa Croce is the burial-place of the\r\nPonziani family, and was the scene of the celebrated ecstasy of the\r\nfavourite Roman saint Francesca Romana.\r\n\r\n     \"The mortal remains of Vanozza Ponziani (sister-in-law of\r\n     Francesca) were laid in the church of Ara-Cœli, in the chapel of\r\n     Santa Croce. The Roman people resorted there in crowds to behold\r\n     once more their loved benefactress--the mother of the poor, the\r\n     consoler of the afflicted. All strove to carry away some little\r\n     memorial of one who had gone about among them doing good, and\r\n     during the three days which preceded the interment, the concourse\r\n     did not abate. On the day of the funeral Francesca knelt on one\r\n     side of the coffin, and, in sight of all the crowd, she was wrapped\r\n     in ecstasy. They saw her body lifted from the ground, and a\r\n     seraphic expression in her uplifted face. They heard her murmur\r\n     several times with an indescribable emphasis the word 'Quando?\r\n     Quando?' When all was over, she still remained immoveable; it\r\n     seemed as if her soul had risen on the wings of prayer, and\r\n     followed Vanozza's spirit into the realms of bliss. At last her\r\n     confessor ordered her to rise and go and attend on the sick. She\r\n     instantly complied, and walked away to the hospital which she had\r\n     founded, apparently unconscious of everything about her, and only\r\n     roused from her trance by the habit of obedience, which, in or out\r\n     of ecstasy, never forsook her.\"--_Lady Georgiana Fullerton's Life\r\n     of Sta. Fr. Romana._\r\n\r\nThere are several good pictures over the altars in the aisles of\r\nAra-Cœli. In the Chapel of St Margaret of Cortona are frescoes\r\nillustrative of her life by _Filippo Evangelisti_,--in that of S.\r\nAntonio, frescoes by _Nicola da Pesaro_;--but no one should omit\r\nvisiting the first chapel on the right of the west door, dedicated to S.\r\nBernardino of Siena, and painted by _Bernardino Pinturicchio_, who has\r\nput forth his best powers to do honour to his patron saint with a series\r\nof exquisite frescoes, representing his assuming the monastic habit, his\r\npreaching, his vision of the Saviour, his penitence, death, and burial.\r\n\r\nAlmost opposite this--closed except during Epiphany--is the Chapel of\r\nthe _Presepio_, where the famous image of the _Santissimo Bambino d'Ara\r\nCœli_ is shown at that season lying in a manger.\r\n\r\n     \"The simple meaning of the term _Presepio_ is a manger; but it is\r\n     also used in the Church to signify a representation of the birth of\r\n     Christ. In the Ara-Cœli the whole of one of the side-chapels is\r\n     devoted to this exhibition. In the foreground is a grotto, in which\r\n     is seated the Virgin Mary, with Joseph at her side and the\r\n     miraculous Bambino in her lap. Immediately behind are an ass and an\r\n     ox. On one side kneel the shepherds and kings in adoration; and\r\n     above, God the Father is seen surrounded by crowds of cherubs and\r\n     angels playing on instruments, as in the early pictures of Raphael.\r\n     In the background is a scenic representation of a pastoral\r\n     landscape, on which all the skill of the scene-painter is expended.\r\n     Shepherds guard their flocks far away, reposing under palm-trees or\r\n     standing on green slopes which glow in the sunshine. The distances\r\n     and perspective are admirable. In the middle ground is a crystal\r\n     fountain of glass, near which sheep, preternaturally white, and\r\n     made of real wool and cotton wool, are feeding, tended by figures\r\n     of shepherds carved in wood. Still nearer come women bearing great\r\n     baskets of real oranges and other fruits on their heads. All the\r\n     nearer figures are full-sized, carved in wood, painted, and dressed\r\n     in appropriate robes. The miraculous Bambino is a painted doll\r\n     swaddled in a white dress, which is crusted over with magnificent\r\n     diamonds, emeralds, and rubies. The Virgin also wears in her ears\r\n     superb diamond pendants. The general effect of the scenic show is\r\n     admirable, and crowds flock to it and press about it all day long.\r\n\r\n     \"While this is taking place on one side of the church, on the other\r\n     is a very different and quite as singular an exhibition. Around one\r\n     of the antique columns a stage is erected, from which little\r\n     maidens are reciting, with every kind of pretty gesticulation,\r\n     sermons, dialogues, and little speeches, in explanation of the\r\n     _Presepio_ opposite. Sometimes two of them are engaged in alternate\r\n     questions and answers about the mysteries of the Incarnation and\r\n     the Redemption. Sometimes the recitation is a piteous description\r\n     of the agony of the Saviour and the sufferings of the Madonna, the\r\n     greatest stress being, however, always laid upon the latter. All\r\n     these little speeches have been written for them by their priest or\r\n     some religious friend, committed to memory, and practised with\r\n     appropriate gestures over and over again at home. Their little\r\n     piping voices are sometimes guilty of such comic breaks and\r\n     changes, that the crowd about them rustles into a murmurous\r\n     laughter. Sometimes, also, one of the little preachers has a\r\n     _dispetto_, pouts, shakes her shoulders, and refuses to go on with\r\n     her part; another, however, always stands ready on the platform to\r\n     supply the vacancy, until friends have coaxed, reasoned, or\r\n     threatened the little pouter into obedience. These children are\r\n     often very beautiful and graceful, and their comical little\r\n     gestures and intonations, their clasping of hands and rolling up of\r\n     eyes, have a very amusing and interesting effect.\"--_Story's Roba\r\n     di Roma._\r\n\r\nAt other times the Bambino dwells in the inner Sacristy, where it can be\r\nvisited by admiring pilgrims. It is a fresh-coloured doll, tightly\r\nswathed in gold and silver tissue, crowned, and sparkling with jewels.\r\nIt has servants of its own, and a carriage in which it drives out with\r\nits attendants, and goes to visit the sick. Devout peasants always kneel\r\nas the blessed infant passes. Formerly it was taken to sick persons and\r\nleft on their beds for some hours, in the hope that it would work a\r\nmiracle. Now it is never left alone. In explanation of this, it is said\r\nthat an audacious woman formed the design of appropriating to herself\r\nthe holy image and its benefits. She had another doll prepared of the\r\nsame size and appearance as the \"Santissimo,\" and having feigned\r\nsickness, and obtained permission to have it left with her, she dressed\r\nthe false image in its clothes, and sent it back to Ara-Cœli. The\r\nfraud was not discovered till night, when the Franciscan monks were\r\nawakened by the most furious ringing of bells and by thundering knocks\r\nat the west door of the church, and hastening thither could see nothing\r\nbut a wee naked pink foot peeping in from under the door; but when they\r\nopened the door, without stood the little naked figure of the true\r\nBambino of Ara-Cœli, shivering in the wind and the rain,--so the\r\nfalse baby was sent back in disgrace, and the real baby restored to its\r\nhome, never to be trusted away alone any more.\r\n\r\nIn the sacristy is the following inscription relating to the Bambino:--\r\n\r\n     \"Ad hoc sacellum Ara Cœli a festo nativitatis domini usque ad\r\n     festum Epiphaniæ magna populi frequentia invisitur et colitur in\r\n     presepio Christi nati infantuli simulacrum ex oleæ ligno apud\r\n     montem olivarum Hierosolymis a quodam devoto Minorita sculptum eo\r\n     animo, ut ad hoc festum celebrandum deportaretur. De quo in primis\r\n     hoc accidit, quod deficiente colore inter barbaras gentes ad\r\n     plenam infantuli figurationem et formam, devotus et anxius artifex,\r\n     professione laicus, precibus et orationibus impetravit, ut sacrum\r\n     simulacrum divinitus carneo colore perfunctum reperiretur. Cumque\r\n     navi Italiam veheretur, facto naufragio apud Tusciæ oras, simulacri\r\n     capsa Liburnum appulit. Ex quo, recognita, expectabatur, enim a\r\n     Fratribus, et jam fama illius a Hierosolymis ad nostras familiæ\r\n     partes advenerat, ad destinatam sibi Capitolii sedem devenit.\r\n     Fertur etiam, quod aliquando ex nimia devotione à quadam devota\r\n     fœmina sublatum ad suas ædes miraculosè remeaverit. Quapropter\r\n     in maxima veneratione semper est habitum a Romanis civibus, et\r\n     universo populo donatum monilibus, et jocalibus pretiosis,\r\n     liberalioribusque in dies prosequitur oblationibus.\"\r\n\r\nThe outer Sacristy contains a fine picture of the Holy Family by _Giulio\r\nRomano_.\r\n\r\nThe scene on the long flight of steps which leads to the west door of\r\nAra-Cœli is very curious during Epiphany.\r\n\r\n     \"If any one visit the Ara-Cœli during an afternoon in Christmas\r\n     or Epiphany, the scene is very striking. The flight of one hundred\r\n     and twenty-four steps is then thronged by merchants of Madonna\r\n     wares, who spread them out over the steps and hang them against the\r\n     walls and balustrades. Here are to be seen all sorts of curious\r\n     little coloured prints of the Madonna and Child of the most\r\n     extraordinary quality, little bags, pewter medals, and crosses\r\n     stamped with the same figures and to be worn on the neck--all\r\n     offered at once for the sum of one _baiocco_. Here also are framed\r\n     pictures of the saints, of the Nativity, and in a word of all sorts\r\n     of religious subjects appertaining to the season. Little wax dolls,\r\n     clad in cotton-wool to represent the Saviour, and sheep made of the\r\n     same materials, are also sold by the basket-full. Children and\r\n     _Contadini_ are busy buying them, and there is a deafening roar all\r\n     up and down the steps, of 'Mezzo baiocco, bello colorito, mezzo\r\n     baiocco, la Santissima Concezione Incoronata,'--'Diario Romano,\r\n     Lunario Romano nuovo,'--'Ritratto colorito, medaglia e quadruccio,\r\n     un baiocco tutti, un baiocco tutti,'--'Bambinella di cera, un\r\n     baiocco.' None of the prices are higher than one baiocco, except to\r\n     strangers, and generally several articles are held up together,\r\n     enumerated, and proffered with a loud voice for this sum. Meanwhile\r\n     men, women, children, priests, beggars, soldiers, and _villani_ are\r\n     crowding up and down, and we crowd with them.\"--_Roba di Roma_, i.\r\n     72.\r\n\r\n     \"On the sixth of January the lofty steps of Ara-Cœli looked like\r\n     an ant-hill, so thronged were they with people. Men and boys who\r\n     sold little books (legends and prayers), rosaries, pictures of\r\n     saints, medallions, chestnuts, oranges, and other things, shouted\r\n     and made a great noise. Little boys and girls were still preaching\r\n     zealously in the church, and people of all classes were crowding\r\n     thither. Processions advanced with the thundering cheerful music of\r\n     the fire-corps. Il Bambino, a painted image of wood, covered with\r\n     jewels, and with a yellow crown on its head, was carried by a monk\r\n     in white gloves, and exhibited to the people from a kind of\r\n     altar-like erection at the top of the Ara-Cœli steps. Everybody\r\n     dropped down upon their knees; Il Bambino was shown on all sides,\r\n     the music thundered, and the smoking censers were\r\n     swung.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\nThe _Convent of Ara-Cœli_ contains much that is picturesque and\r\ninteresting. S. Giovanni Capistrano was abbot here in the reign of\r\nEugenius IV.\r\n\r\nLet us now descend from the Capitoline Piazza towards the Forum, by the\r\nstaircase on the left of the Palace of the Senator. Close to the foot of\r\nthis staircase is a church, very obscure-looking, with some rude\r\nfrescoes on the exterior. Yet every one must enter this building, for\r\nhere are the famous _Mamertine Prisons_, excavated from the solid rock\r\nunder the Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe prisons are entered through the low Church of S. Pietro in Carcere,\r\nhung round with votive offerings and blazing with lamps.\r\n\r\n     \"There is an upper chamber in the Mamertine Prisons, over what is\r\n     said to have been--and very possibly may have been--the dungeon of\r\n     St. Peter. The chamber is now fitted up as an oratory, dedicated to\r\n     that saint; and it lives, as a distinct and separate place, in my\r\n     recollection, too. It is very small and low-roofed; and the dread\r\n     and gloom of the ponderous, obdurate old prison are on it, as if\r\n     they had come up in a dark mist through the floor. Hanging on the\r\n     walls, among the clustered votive offerings, are objects, at once\r\n     strangely in keeping and strangely at variance with the\r\n     place--rusty daggers, knives, pistols, clubs, divers instruments of\r\n     violence and murder, brought here, fresh from use, and hung up to\r\n     propitiate offended Heaven; as if the blood upon them would drain\r\n     off in consecrated air, and have no voice to cry with. It is all so\r\n     silent and so close, and tomblike; and the dungeons below are so\r\n     black, and stealthy, and stagnant, and naked; that this little dark\r\n     spot becomes a dream within a dream: and in the vision of great\r\n     churches which come rolling past me like a sea, it is a small wave\r\n     by itself, that melts into no other wave, and does not flow on with\r\n     the rest.\"--_Dickens._\r\n\r\nEnclosed in the church, near the entrance, may be observed the outer\r\nfrieze of the prison wall, with the inscription C. TIBIUS. C. F.\r\nRUFINUS. M.. COCCEIUS. NERVA. COS. EX. S. C., recording the names of two\r\nconsuls of A.D. 22, who are supposed to have repaired the prison.\r\nJuvenal's description of the time when one prison was sufficient for all\r\nthe criminals in Rome naturally refers to this building:\r\n\r\n    \"Felices proavorum atavos, felicia dicas\r\n    Sæcula, quæ quondam sub regibus atque tribunis\r\n    Viderunt uno contentam carcere Romam.\"\r\n\r\n    _Sat._ iii. 312.\r\n\r\nA modern staircase leads to the horrible dungeon of Ancus Martius,\r\nsixteen feet in height, thirty in length, and twenty-two in breadth.\r\nOriginally there was no staircase, and the prisoners were let down\r\nthere, and thence into the lower dungeon, through a hole in the middle\r\nof the ceiling. The large door at the side is a modern innovation,\r\nhaving been opened to admit the vast mass of pilgrims during the festa.\r\nThe whole prison is constructed of huge blocks of tufa without cement.\r\nSome remains are shown of the _Scalæ Gemoniæ_, so called from the groans\r\nof the prisoners--by which the bodies were dragged forth to be exposed\r\nto the insults of the populace or to be thrown into the Tiber. It was by\r\nthis staircase that Cicero came forth and announced the execution of\r\nthe Catiline conspirators to the people in the Forum, by the single word\r\n_Vixerunt_, \"they have ceased to live.\" Close to the exit of these\r\nstairs the Emperor Vitellius was murdered. On the wall by which you\r\ndescend to the lower dungeon is a mark, kissed by the faithful, as the\r\nspot against which St. Peter's head rested. The lower prison, called\r\n_Robur_, is constructed of huge blocks of tufa, fastened together by\r\ncramps of iron and approaching horizontally to a common centre in the\r\nroof. It has been attributed from early times to Servius Tullius; but\r\nAmpère[47] argues against the idea that the lower prison was of later\r\norigin than the upper, and suggests that it is Pelasgic, and older than\r\nany other building in Rome. It is described by Livy, and by Sallust, who\r\ndepicts its horrors in his account of the execution of the Catiline\r\nconspirators.[48] The spot is shown to which these victims were attached\r\nand strangled in turn. In this dungeon, at an earlier period, Appius\r\nClaudius and Oppius the decemvirs committed suicide (B.C. 449). Here\r\nJugurtha, king of Mauritania, was starved to death by Marius. Here\r\nJulius Cæsar, during his triumph for the conquest of Gaul, caused his\r\ngallant enemy Vercingetorix to be put to death. Here Sejanus, the friend\r\nand minister of Tiberius, disgraced too late, was executed for the\r\nmurder of Drusus, son of the emperor, and for an intrigue with his\r\ndaughter-in-law, Livilla. Here, also, Simon Bar-Gioras, the last\r\ndefender of Jerusalem, suffered during the triumph of Titus.\r\n\r\nThe spot is more interesting to the Christian world as the prison of SS.\r\nPeter and Paul, who are said to have been bound for nine months to a\r\npillar, which is shown here. A fountain of excellent water, beneath the\r\nfloor of the prison, is attributed to the prayers of St. Peter, that he\r\nmight have wherewith to baptize his gaolers, Processus and Martinianus;\r\nbut, unfortunately for this ecclesiastical tradition, the fountain is\r\ndescribed by Plutarch as having existed at the time of Jugurtha's\r\nimprisonment This fountain probably gave the dungeon the name of\r\n_Tullianum_, by which it was sometimes known, _tullius_ meaning a\r\nspring.[49] This name probably gave rise to the idea of its connection\r\nwith Servius Tullius.\r\n\r\nIt is hence that the Roman Catholic Church believes that St. Peter and\r\nSt Paul addressed their farewells to the Christian world.\r\n\r\n     That of St. Peter:--\r\n\r\n     \"Shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus\r\n     Christ hath showed me. Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be\r\n     able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.\r\n     For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made\r\n     known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ....\r\n     Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and\r\n     a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\"--_2nd St. Peter._\r\n\r\n     That of St. Paul:--\r\n\r\n     \"God hath not given us a spirit of fear.... Be not thou, therefore,\r\n     ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but\r\n     be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the\r\n     power of God.... I suffer trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds;\r\n     but the word of God is not bound. Therefore I endure all things,\r\n     for the elect's sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which\r\n     is in Christ Jesus.... I charge thee by God and by the Lord Jesus\r\n     Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead ... preach the\r\n     word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort\r\n     with all long-suffering and doctrine; ... watch in all things,\r\n     endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof\r\n     of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of\r\n     my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have\r\n     finished my course, I have kept the faith.\"--_2nd Timothy._\r\n\r\nOn July 4, the prisons are the scene of a picturesque solemnity, when\r\nthey are visited at night by the religious confraternities, who first\r\nkneel and then prostrate themselves in silent devotion.\r\n\r\nAbove the Church of S. Pietro in Carcere, is that of _S. Giuseppe del\r\nFalegnami_, St. Joseph of the Carpenters.\r\n\r\n     \"Pourquoi les guides et les antiquaires qui nous ont si souvent\r\n     montré la voie triomphale qui mène au Capitale et nous en ont tant\r\n     de fois énuméré les souvenirs; pourquoi aucun d'eux ne nous a-t-il\r\n     jamais parlé de ce qui survint le jour du triomphe de Titus,\r\n     là-bas, près des prisons Mamertines? Laisse-moi vous rappeler que\r\n     ce jour-là le triomphateur, au moment de monter au temple, devant\r\n     verser le sang d'une victime, s'arrêta à cette place, tandis que\r\n     l'on détachait de son cortége un captif de plus haute taille et\r\n     plus richement vêtu que les autres, et qu'on l'emmenait dans cette\r\n     prison pour y achever son supplice avec le lacet même qu'il portait\r\n     autour du cou. Ce ne fût qu'après cette immolation que le cortége\r\n     reprit sa marche et acheva de monter jusqu'au Capitole! Ce captif\r\n     dont on ne daigne nous parler, c'était Simon Bar-Gioras; c'était un\r\n     des trois derniers défenseurs de Jérusalem; c'était un de ceux qui\r\n     la défendirent jusqu'au bout, mais hélas! qui la défendirent comme\r\n     des démons maîtres d'une âme de laquelle ils ne veulent pas se\r\n     laisser chasser, et non point comme des champions héroïques d'une\r\n     cause sacrée et perdue. Aussi cette grandeur que la seule infortune\r\n     suffit souvent pour donner, elle manque à la calamité la plus\r\n     grande que le monde ait vue, et les noms attachés à cette immense\r\n     catastrophe ne demeurèrent pas même fameux! Jean de Giscala,\r\n     Eléazar, Simon Bar-Gioras; qui pense à eux aujourd'hui? L'univers\r\n     entier proclame et vénère les noms de deux pauvres juifs qui,\r\n     quatre ans auparavant, dans cette même prison, avaient eux aussi\r\n     attendu la supplice; mais le malheur, le courage, la mort tragique\r\n     des autres, ne leur ont point donné la gloire, et un dédaigneux\r\n     oubli les a effacés de la mémoire des hommes!\"--_(Anne Severin)\r\n     Mrs. Augustus Craven._\r\n\r\n                        \"Along the sacred way\r\n    Hither the triumph came, and, winding round\r\n    With acclamation, and the martial clang\r\n    Of instruments, and cars laden with spoil,\r\n    Stopped at the sacred stair that then appeared,\r\n    Then thro' the darkness broke, ample, star-bright,\r\n    As tho' it led to heaven.

Buonaventura)--Meta Sudans--Arch of\r\n     Constantine--Coliseum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the Corso to its end at the Ripresa dei Barberi, and turning\r\nto the left, we find ourselves at once amid the remains of the _Forum of\r\nTrajan_, erected by the architect Apollodorus for the Emperor Trajan on\r\nhis return from the wars of the Danube. This forum now presents the\r\nappearance of a ravine between the Capitoline and Quirinal, but is an\r\nartificial hollow, excavated to facilitate the circulation of life\r\nwithin the city. An inscription over the door of the column, which\r\novertops the other ruins, shows that it was raised in order to mark the\r\ndepth of earth which was removed to construct the forum. The earth was\r\nformerly as high as the top of the column, which reaches, 100 Roman\r\nfeet, to the level of the Palatine Hill. The forum was sometimes called\r\nthe \"Ulpian,\" from one of the names of the emperor.\r\n\r\n     \"Before the year A.D. 107 the splendours of the city and the Campus\r\n     beyond it were still separated by a narrow isthmus, thronged\r\n     perhaps by the squalid cabins of the poor, and surmounted by the\r\n     remains of the Servian wall which ran along its summit. Step by\r\n     step the earlier emperors had approached with their new forums to\r\n     the foot of this obstruction. Domitian was the first to contemplate\r\n     and commence its removal. Nerva had the fortune to consecrate and\r\n     to give his own name to a portion of his predecessor's\r\n     construction; but Trajan undertook to complete the bold design, and\r\n     the genius of his architect triumphed over all obstacles, and\r\n     executed a work which exceeded in extent and splendour any previous\r\n     achievement of the kind. He swept away every building on the site,\r\n     levelled the spot on which they had stood, and laid out a vast area\r\n     of columnar galleries, connecting halls and chambers for public use\r\n     and recreation. The new forum was adorned with two libraries, one\r\n     for Greek, the other for Roman volumes, and it was bounded on the\r\n     west by a basilica of magnificent dimensions. Beyond this basilica,\r\n     and within the limits of the Campus, the same architect\r\n     (Apollodorus) erected a temple for the worship of Trajan himself;\r\n     but this work probably belonged to the reign of Trajan's successor,\r\n     and no doubt the Ulpian forum, with all its adjuncts, occupied many\r\n     years in building. The area was adorned with numerous statues, in\r\n     which the figure of Trajan was frequently repeated, and among its\r\n     decorations were groups in bronze or marble, representing his most\r\n     illustrious actions. The balustrades and cornices of the whole mass\r\n     of buildings flamed with gilded images of arms and horses. Here\r\n     stood the great equestrian statue of the emperor; here was the\r\n     triumphal arch decreed him by the senate, adorned with sculpture,\r\n     which Constantine, two centuries later, transferred without a blush\r\n     to his own, a barbarous act of this first Christian emperor, to\r\n     which however we probably owe their preservation to this day from\r\n     more barbarous spoliation.\"--_Merivale, Romans under the Empire_,\r\n     ch. lxiii.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful _Column of Trajan_ was erected by the senate and people of\r\nRome, A.D. 114. It is composed of thirty-four blocks of marble, and is\r\ncovered with a spiral band of bas-reliefs illustrative of the Dacian\r\nwars, and increasing in size as it nears the top, so that it preserves\r\nthroughout the same proportion when seen from below. It was formerly\r\ncrowned by a statue of Trajan, holding a gilt globe, which latter is\r\nstill preserved in the Hall of Bronzes in the Capitol. This statue had\r\nfallen from its pedestal long before Sixtus V. replaced it by the\r\nexisting figure of St. Peter. At the foot of the column was a sepulchral\r\nchamber, intended to receive the imperial ashes, which were however\r\npreserved in a golden urn, upon an altar in front of it.\r\n\r\n                            \"And apostolic statues climb\r\n    To crush the imperial urn, whose ashes slept sublime.\"\r\n           _Childe Harold_, cx.\r\n\r\nIt was while walking in this forum, that Gregory the Great, observing\r\none of the marble groups which told of a good and great action of\r\nTrajan, lamented bitterly that the soul of so noble a man should be\r\nlost, and prayed earnestly for the salvation of the heathen emperor. He\r\nwas told that the soul of Trajan should be saved, but that to ensure\r\nthis he must either himself undergo the pains of purgatory for three\r\ndays, or suffer earthly pain and sickness for the rest of his life. He\r\nchose the latter, and never after was in health. This incident is\r\nnarrated by his three biographers, John and Paul Diaconus, and John of\r\nSalisbury.[50]\r\n\r\nThe forum of Trajan was partly uncovered by Pope Paul III. in the\r\nsixteenth century, but excavated in its present form by the French in\r\n1812. There is much still buried under the streets and neighbouring\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n     \"All over the surface of what once was Rome it seems to be the\r\n     effort of Time to bury up the ancient city, as it were a corpse,\r\n     and he the sexton; so that, in eighteen centuries, the soil over\r\n     its grave has grown very deep, by the slow scattering of dust, and\r\n     the accumulation of more modern decay upon older ruin.\r\n\r\n     \"This was the fate, also, of Trajan's forum, until some papal\r\n     antiquary, a few hundred years ago, began to hollow it out again,\r\n     and disclosed the whole height of the gigantic column, wreathed\r\n     round with bas-reliefs of the old emperor's warlike deeds (rich\r\n     sculpture, which, twining from the base to the capital, must be an\r\n     ugly spectacle for his ghostly eyes, if he considers that this\r\n     huge, storied shaft must be laid before the judgment seat, as a\r\n     piece of the evidence of what he did in the flesh). In the area\r\n     before the column stands a grove of stone, consisting of the broken\r\n     and unequal shafts of a vanished temple, still keeping a majestic\r\n     order, and apparently incapable of further demolition. The modern\r\n     edifices of the piazza (wholly built, no doubt, out of the spoil of\r\n     its old magnificence) look down into the hollow space whence these\r\n     pillars rise.\r\n\r\n     \"One of the immense gray granite shafts lies in the piazza, on the\r\n     verge of the area. It is a great, solid fact of the Past, making\r\n     old Rome actually visible to the touch and eye; and no study of\r\n     history, nor force of thought, nor magic of song, can so vitally\r\n     assure us that Rome once existed, as this sturdy specimen of what\r\n     its rulers and people wrought. There is still a polish remaining on\r\n     the hard substance of the pillar, the polish of eighteen centuries\r\n     ago, as yet but half rubbed off.\"--_Hawthorne, Transformation._\r\n\r\nOn the north of this forum are two churches: that nearest to the Corso\r\nis _Sta. Maria di Loreto_ (founded by the corporation of bakers in\r\n1500), with a dome surmounted by a picturesque lantern by Giuliano di\r\nSangallo, c. 1506. It contains a statue of Sta. Susanna (_not_ the\r\nSusanna of the Elders) by _Fiammingo_ (François de Quesnoy), which is\r\njustly considered the chef-d'œuvre of the Bernini School. The\r\ncompanion church is called _Sta. Maria di Vienna_, and (like Sta. Maria\r\ndella Vittoria) commemorates the liberation of Vienna from the Turks in\r\n1683, by Sobieski, king of Poland. It was built by Innocent XI.\r\n\r\nLeaving the forum at the opposite corner by the Via Alessandrina, and\r\npassing under the high wall of the Convent of the Nunziatina, a street,\r\nopening on the left, discloses several beautiful pillars, which, after\r\nhaving borne various names, are now declared to be the remains of the\r\n_Temple of Mars Ultor_, built by Augustus in his new forum, which was\r\nerected in order to provide accommodation for the crowds which\r\noverflowed the Forum Romanum and Forum Julium.\r\n\r\n     \"The title of Ultor marked the war and the victory by which,\r\n     agreeably to his vow, Augustus had avenged his uncle's death.\r\n\r\n    \"'Mars ades, et satia scelerato sanguine ferrum;\r\n      Stetque favor causa pro meliore tuus.\r\n    Templa feres, et, me victore, vocaberis Ultor.'[51]\r\n\r\n     The porticoes, which extended on each side of the temple with a\r\n     gentle curve, contained statues of distinguished Roman generals.\r\n     The banquets of the Salii were transferred to this temple, a\r\n     circumstance which led to its identification, from the discovery of\r\n     an inscription here recording the _mansiones_ of these priests.\r\n     Like the priesthood in general, they appear to have been fond of\r\n     good living, and there is a well-known anecdote of the Emperor\r\n     Claudius having been lured by the steams of their banquet from his\r\n     judicial functions in the adjacent forum, to come and take part in\r\n     their feast. The temple was appropriated to meetings of the senate\r\n     in which matters connected with wars and triumphs were debated....\r\n     Here while Tiberius was building a temple to Augustus upon the\r\n     Palatine, his golden statue reposed upon a couch.\"--_Dyer's City of\r\n     Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"Up to the time of Augustus, the god Mars, the reputed father of\r\n     the Roman race, had never, it is said, enjoyed the distinction of a\r\n     temple within the walls. He was then introduced into the city which\r\n     he had saved from overthrow and ruin; and the aid he had lent in\r\n     bringing the murderers of Cæsar to justice, was signalised by the\r\n     title of Avenger, by which he was now specially addressed.... The\r\n     temple of Mars Ultor, of gigantic proportions, 'Et deus est ingens\r\n     et opus,' was erected in the new forum of Augustus at the foot of\r\n     the Capitoline and Quirinal hills.\"--_Merivale, Romans under the\r\n     Empire._\r\n\r\n     \"Ce temple était particulièrement cher à Auguste. Il voulut que les\r\n     magistrats en partissent pour aller dans leurs provinces; que\r\n     l'honneur du triomphe y fût décerné, et que les triomphateurs y\r\n     fissent hommage à Mars Vengeur de leur couronne et de leur sceptre;\r\n     que les drapeaux pris à l'ennemi y fussent conservés; que les chefs\r\n     de la cavalerie exécutassent des jeux en avant des marches de ce\r\n     temple; enfin que les censeurs, en sortant de leur charge, y\r\n     plantassent le clou sacré, vieil usage étrusque jusque-là attaché\r\n     au Capitole. Auguste désirait que ce temple fondé par lui prît\r\n     l'importance du Capitole.\r\n\r\n     \"Il fit dédier le temple par ses petit-fils Caius et Lucius; et son\r\n     autre petit-fils, Agrippa, à la tête des plus nobles enfants de\r\n     Rome, y célébra le jeu de Troie, qui rappelait l'origine prétendue\r\n     troyenne de César; deux cent soixante lions furent égorgés dans la\r\n     cirque, c'était leur place; deux troupes de gladiateurs\r\n     combattirent dans les Septa ou se faisaient les élections au temps\r\n     de la république, comme si Auguste eût voulu, par ces combats qui\r\n     se livraient en l'honneur des morts, célébrer les funérailles de la\r\n     liberté romaine.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ i. 224.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Mars stands at the north-eastern corner of the magnificent\r\n_Forum of Augustus_, which extended from here as far as the present Via\r\nAlessandrina, surpassing in size the forum of Julius Cæsar, to which it\r\nwas adjoining. It was of sufficient size to be frequently used for\r\nfights of animals (venationes). Among its ornaments were statues of\r\nAugustus triumphant and of the subdued provinces--with inscriptions\r\nillustrative of the great deeds he had accomplished there; also a\r\npicture by Apelles representing War with her hands bound behind her,\r\nseated upon a pile of arms. Part of the boundary wall exists, enclosing\r\non two sides the remains of the temple of Mars Ultor, and is constructed\r\nof huge masses of peperino. The arch, in the wall close to the temple,\r\nis known as Arco dei Pantani. The sudden turn in the wall here is\r\ninteresting as commemorating a concession made to the wish of some\r\nproprietors, who were unwilling to part with their houses for the sake\r\nof the forum.\r\n\r\n     \"C'est l'histoire du moulin de Sans-Souci, qui du reste paraît\r\n     n'être pas vraie.\r\n\r\n     \"Il est piquant d'assister aujourd'hui à ce ménagement d'Auguste\r\n     pour l'opinion qu'il voulait gagner.

L'obliquité de la politique\r\n     d'Auguste est visible dans l'obliquité de ce mur, qui montre et\r\n     rend pour ainsi dire palpable le manège adroit de la tyrannie, se\r\n     déguisant pour se fonder.

Up to the\r\nseventeenth century seven magnificent columns of the temple of Minerva\r\nwere still standing, but they were destroyed by Paul V., who used part\r\nof them in building the Fontana Paolina. The existing remains consist of\r\ntwo half-buried Corinthian columns with a figure of Minerva, and a\r\nfrieze of bas-reliefs.\r\n\r\n     \"Les bas-reliefs du forum de Nerva représentent des femmes occupées\r\n     des travaux d'aiguille, auxquels présidait Minerve. Quand on se\r\n     rappelle, que Domitien avait placé à Albano, près du temple de\r\n     cette déesse, un collège de prêtres qui imitaient la parure et les\r\n     mœurs de femmes, on est tenté de croire qu'il y a dans le choix\r\n     des subjets figurés ici une allusion aux habitudes efféminées de\r\n     ces prétres.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 161.\r\n\r\n     \"The portico of the temple of Minerva is most rich and beautiful in\r\n     architecture, but woefully gnawed by time, and shattered by\r\n     violence, besides being buried midway in the accumulation of the\r\n     soil, that rises over dead Rome like a flood-tide. Within this\r\n     edifice of antique sanctity a baker's shop is now established, with\r\n     an entrance on one side; for everywhere, the remnants of old\r\n     grandeur and divinity have been made available for the meanest\r\n     neccessities of to-day.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\nIt was in this forum that Nerva caused Vetronius Turinus, who had\r\ntrafficked with his court interest, to be suffocated with smoke, a\r\nherald proclaiming at the time, \"Fumo punitur qui vendidit fumum.\"\r\n\r\nReturning a short distance down the Via Alessandrina, and turning (left)\r\ndown the Via Bonella, we traverse the site of the _Forum of Julius\r\nCæsar_, upon which 4000 sestertia (800,000 _l._) were expended, and\r\nwhich is described by Dion-Cassius as having been more beautiful than\r\nthe Forum Romanum. It was ornamented with a Temple of Venus\r\nGenetrix--from whom Julius Cæsar claimed to be descended--which\r\ncontained a statue of the goddess by Archesilaus, a statue of Cæsar\r\nhimself, and a group of Ajax and Medea by Timomacus. Here, also, Cæsar\r\nhad the effrontery to place the statue of his mistress, Cleopatra, by\r\nthe side of that of the goddess. In front of the temple stood a bronze\r\nfigure of a horse--supposed to be the famous Bucephalus--the work of\r\nLysippus.\r\n\r\n    \"Cedat equus Latiæ qui, contra templa Diones,\r\n    Cæsarei stat sede Fori.

The\r\ncollections are open from 9 to 5 daily. A ceiling representing Bacchus\r\nand Ariadne, is by _Guido_.

Du Pays._\r\n\r\nJust beyond St. Luca, we enter the Forum Romanum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe interest of Rome comes to its climax in the Forum. In spite of all\r\nthat is destroyed, and all that is buried, so much still remains to be\r\nseen, and every stone has its story. Even without entering into all the\r\nvexed archæological questions which have filled the volumes of Canina,\r\nBunsen, Niebuhr, and many others, the occupation which a traveller\r\ninterested in history will find here is all but inexhaustible; and,\r\nafter the disputes of centuries, the different sites seem now to be\r\nverified with tolerable certainty. The study of the Roman Forum is\r\ncomplicated by the _succession_ of public edifices by which it has been\r\noccupied, each period of Roman history having a different set of\r\nbuildings, and each in a great measure supplanting that which went\r\nbefore. Another difficulty has naturally arisen from the exceedingly\r\ncircumscribed space in which all these buildings have to be arranged,\r\nand which shows that many of the ancient temples must have been mere\r\nchapels, and the so-called \"lakes\" little more than fountains.\r\n\r\n     \"This spot, where the senate had its assemblies, where the rostra\r\n     were placed, where the destinies of the world were discussed, is\r\n     the most celebrated and the most classical of ancient Rome. It was\r\n     adorned with the most magnificent monuments, which were so crowded\r\n     upon one another, that their heaped-up ruins are not sufficient for\r\n     all the names which are handed down to us by history. The course of\r\n     centuries has overthrown the Forum, and made it impossible to\r\n     define; the level of the ancient soil is twenty-four feet below\r\n     that of to-day, and however great a desire one may feel to\r\n     reproduce the past, it must be acknowledged that this very\r\n     difference of level is a terrible obstacle to the powers of\r\n     imagination; again, the uncertainties of archæologists are\r\n     discouraging to curiosity and the desire of illusion. For more than\r\n     three centuries learning has been at work upon this field of ruins,\r\n     without being able even to agree upon its bearings; some describing\r\n     it as extending from north to south, others from east to west. The\r\n     origin of the Forum goes back to the alliance of the Romans and\r\n     Sabines. It was a space surrounded by marshes, which extended\r\n     between the Palatine and the Capitol, occupied by the two colonies,\r\n     and serving as a neutral ground where they could meet. The Curtian\r\n     Lake was situated in the midst. Constantly adorned under the\r\n     republic and the empire, it appears that it continued to exist\r\n     until the eleventh century. Its total ruin dates from Robert\r\n     Guiscard, who, when called to the assistance of Gregory VII., left\r\n     it a heap of ruins. Abandoned for many centuries, it became a\r\n     receptacle for rubbish, which gradually raised the level of the\r\n     soil. About 1547, Paul III. began to make excavations in the Forum.\r\n     Then the place became a cattle-market, and the glorious name of\r\n     Forum Romanum changed into that of Campo Vaccino.\r\n\r\n     \"The Forum was surrounded by a portico of two stories, the lower of\r\n     which was occupied by shops (tabernæ). In the beginning of the\r\n     sixth century of Rome, two fires destroyed part of the edifices\r\n     with which it had been embellished. This was an opportunity for\r\n     isolating the Forum, and basilicas and temples were raised in\r\n     succession along its sides, which in their turn were partly\r\n     destroyed in the fire of Nero. Domitian rebuilt a part, and added\r\n     the temple of Vespasian, and Antoninus that of Faustina.\"--_A. Du\r\n     Pays._\r\n\r\nThe excavations which were made in the Forum before 1871 are for the\r\nmost part due to the generosity of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. The\r\npapal government always displayed the most extraordinary apathy about\r\nextending them, and, when a large excavation was made in the winter of\r\n1869--70, by the British Archæological Society, in front of the Church\r\nof Sta. Martina, insisted on its being immediately filled up again,\r\ninstead of extending it, as might easily have been done, to join the\r\nexcavation which had long existed on the Clivus Capitolinus. Lately the\r\nexcavations have been considerably increased, but were the roads\r\nleading to the Forum to be closed, and a large body of efficient\r\nlabourers set to work, the whole of the Roman Forum and its surroundings\r\nmight be laid bare in a month, without any injury to the interesting\r\nchurches in its neighbourhood. At present, even that part which is\r\ndisinterred is cut up by a number of raised causeways, which distract\r\nthe eye and mar the general effect, and the excavations, recommenced by\r\nthe Italian government, are slowly and inadequately carried on.\r\n\r\nIf we stand on the causeway in front of the arch of Septimius Severus,\r\nand turn towards the Capitol, we look upon the Clivus Capitolinus, which\r\nis perfectly crowded with historical sites and fragments, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. The modern Capitol, resting on the _Tabularium_. This is one of the\r\nearliest architectural relics in Rome. It is built in the Etruscan\r\nstyle, of huge blocks of tufa or peperino placed long-and cross-ways\r\nalternately. It was formerly composed of two stages called Camellaria.\r\nOnly the lower now remains. It contained the tables of the laws. The\r\ncorridor which remains in the interior is used as a museum of\r\narchitectural fragments. The Tabularium probably communicated with the\r\n_Ærarium_ in the temple of Saturn.\r\n\r\n2. On the right of the excavated space, and nearest the Tabularium, the\r\nsite of the _Tribune_, in front of which were the _Rostra_, to which the\r\nhead of Octavius was affixed by Marius, and the head and hand of Cicero\r\nby Antony, and where Fulvia, the widow of Clodius, spat in his dead\r\nface, and pierced his inanimate tongue with the pin which she wore in\r\nher hair. In front of the rostrum were the statues of the three Sibyls\r\ncalled Tria Fata.\r\n\r\n3. Below, a little(**typo? little?) more to the right, is the site of\r\nthe _Comitium_, where the survivor of the Horatii was condemned to\r\ndeath, and saved by the voice of the people. Here, also, was the\r\ntrophied pillar which bore the arms of the Curiatii. In the area of the\r\nComitium grew the famous fig-tree which was always preserved here in\r\ncommemoration of the tree under which Romulus and Remus were suckled by\r\nthe wolf, and beneath which was a bronze representation of the wolf and\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\n4. A little more to the left, is the site of _the Vulcanal_, so called\r\nfrom an altar dedicated to Vulcan, a platform (still defined) where, in\r\nthe earliest times, Romulus and Tatius used to meet on intermediate\r\nground and transact affairs common to both; and where Brutus was seated,\r\nwhen, without any change of countenance, he saw his two sons beaten and\r\nbeheaded. Adjoining the Vulcanal was the _Græcostasis_, where foreign\r\nambassadors waited before they were admitted to an audience of the\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\n5. Below the Vulcanal, and just behind the Arch of Severus, is the site\r\nof the _Temple of Concord_, dedicated, with blasphemous\r\ninappropriateness, B.C. 121, by the consul Opimius, immediately after\r\nthe murder of Caius Gracchus. Here Cicero pronounced his orations\r\nagainst Catiline before the senate. A pavement of coloured marbles\r\nremains. At its base are still to be seen some small remains of the\r\n_Colonna Mænia_, which was surmounted by the statue of C. Mænius, who\r\ndecorated the rostra with the iron beaks of vessels taken in war.\r\n\r\n6. The three beautiful columns which are still standing were attributed\r\nto a temple of Jupiter Tonans, but are now decided to belong to the\r\n_Temple of Vespasian_. The engravings of Piranesi represent them as\r\nburied almost to their capitals, and they remained in this state until\r\nthey were disinterred during the first French occupation. The space was\r\nso limited in this part of Rome, that in order to prevent encroaching\r\nupon the street Clivus Capitolinus, which descends the hill between this\r\ntemple and that of Saturn, the temple of Vespasian was raised on a kind\r\nof terrace, and the staircase which led to it was thrust in between the\r\ncolumns. This temple was restored by Septimius Severus, and to this the\r\nletters on the entablature refer, being part of the word _Restituere_.\r\nInstruments of sacrifice are sculptured on the frieze.\r\n\r\n7. On the left of the excavated space, close beneath the Tabularium, a\r\nlow range of columns recently re-erected represents the building called\r\nthe _School of Xanthus_, chambers, for the use of the scribes and\r\npersons in the service of the curule ædiles, which derived their name\r\nfrom Xanthus, a freedman, by whom they were rebuilt.\r\n\r\n8. The eight Ionic columns still standing, part of the _Temple of\r\nSaturn_, the ancient god of the Capitol. Before this temple Pompey sate\r\nsurrounded by soldiers, listening to the orations which Cicero was\r\ndelivering from the rostrum, when he received the personal address, \"Te\r\nenim jam appello, et ea voce ut me exaudire possis.\" Here the tribune\r\nMetellus flung himself before the door and vainly attempted to defend\r\nthe treasure of the _Ærarium_ in this temple against Julius Cæsar. The\r\npresent remains are those of an indifferent and late renovation of an\r\nearlier temple, being composed of columns which differ in diameter, and\r\na frieze put together from fragments which do not belong to one another.\r\nThe original temple was built by Tarquin, and was supposed to mark the\r\nsite of the ancient Sabine altar of the god and the limit of the wood of\r\nrefuge mentioned by Virgil.\r\n\r\n9. Just below the Temple of Saturn is the site of the _Arch of\r\nTiberius_, erected, according to Tacitus, upon the recovery by\r\nGermanicus of the standards which Varus had lost.\r\n\r\n10. The remains of the _Milliarium Aureum_, which formed the upper\r\nextremity of a wall faced with marbles, ending near the arch of Severus\r\nin a small conical pyramid. Distances without the walls were inscribed\r\nupon the Milliarium Aureum, as distances within the walls were upon the\r\npyramid (from which in this case they were also measured) which bore the\r\nname of _Umbilicus Romæ_. The Via Sacra, which is still visible,\r\ndescended from the Capitol between the temples of Saturn and\r\nVespasian,--being known here as the Clivus Capitolinus, and passed to\r\nthe left of--\r\n\r\n11. The _Arch of Septimius Severus_, which was erected by the senate\r\nA.D. 205, in honour of that emperor and his two sons, Caracalla and\r\nGeta. It is adorned with bas-reliefs relating his victories in the\r\neast,--his entry into Babylon and the tower of the temple of Belus are\r\nrepresented. A curious memorial of imperial history may be observed in\r\nthe inscription, where we may still discern the erasure made by\r\nCaracalla after he had put his brother Geta to death in A.D. 213, for\r\nthe sake of obliterating his memory. The added words are OPTIMIS\r\nFORTISSIMISQVE PRINCIPIBUS--but the ancient inscription P. SEPT. LVC.\r\nFIL. GETÆ. NOBILISS. CÆSARI, has been made out by painstaking\r\ndecipherers. In one of the piers is a staircase leading to the top of\r\nthe arch which was formerly (as seen from coins of Severus and\r\nCaracalla) adorned by a car drawn by six horses abreast, and containing\r\nfigures of Severus and his sons. It was in front of this arch that the\r\nstatue of Marcus Aurelius stood, which is now at the Capitol.\r\n\r\n     \"Les proportions de l'arc de Septime-Sévère sont encore belles.\r\n     L'aspect en est imposant; il est solide sans être lourd. La grande\r\n     inscription où se lisent les épithètes victorieuses qui rappellent\r\n     les succès militaires de l'empereur, Parthique, Dacique,\r\n     Adiabénique, se déploie sur une vaste surface et donne à\r\n     l'entablement un air de majesté qu'admirent les artistes. Cette\r\n     inscription est doublement historique; elle rappelle les campagnes\r\n     de Sévère et la tragédie domestique qui après lui ensanglanta sa\r\n     famille, le meurtre d'un de ses fils immolé par l'autre, et\r\n     l'acharnement de celui-ci à poursuivre la mémoire du frère qu'il\r\n     avait fait assassiner. Le nom de Géta a été visiblement effacé par\r\n     Caracalla. La même chose se remarque dans une inscription sur\r\n     bronze qu'on voit au Capitale et sur le petit arc du Marché aux\r\n     bœufs dont j'ai parlé, où l'image de Géta a été effacée comme\r\n     son nom. Caracalla ne permit pas même à ce nom proscrit de se\r\n     cacher parmi les hiéroglyphes. En Egypte, ceux qui composaient le\r\n     nom de Géta ont été grattés sur les monuments.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii.\r\n     278.\r\n\r\n(The excavations in thé Forum are open to the public on the same days as\r\nthe Palace of the Cæsars--Thursdays and Sundays.)\r\n\r\nThe platform on which we have been standing leads to the Via della\r\nConsolazione, occupying the site of the ancient _Vicus Jugarius_, where\r\nAugustus erected an altar to Ceres, and another to Ops Augusta, the\r\ngoddess of wealth. (In this street, on the left, is a good cinque-cento\r\ndoorway.) Where this street leaves the Forum was the so-called _Lacus\r\nServilius_, a basin which probably derived its name from Servilius Ahala\r\n(who slew the philanthropist Sp. Mælius with a dagger near this very\r\nspot), and which was encircled with a ghastly row of heads in the\r\nmassacres under Sylla. This fountain was adorned by M. Aggrippa with a\r\nfigure of a hydra. The right side of the Forum is now occupied for a\r\nconsiderable distance by the disinterred remains of the _Basilica\r\nJulia_, begun by Julius Cæsar, and finished by Augustus, who dedicated\r\nit in honour of his daughter. A basilica of this description was\r\nintended partly as a Law Court and partly as an Exchange. In this\r\nbasilica the judges called Centumviri held their courts, which were four\r\nin number:\r\n\r\n    \"Jam clamor, centumque viri, densumque coronæ\r\n    Vulgus: et infanti Julia tecta placent.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, vi. _Ep._ 38.\r\n\r\nBeyond the basilica are three beautiful columns which belong to a\r\nrestoration of the _Temple of Castor and Pollux_, dedicated by\r\nPostumius, B.C. 484. Here costly sacrifices were always offered in the\r\nides of July, at the anniversary of the battle of the Lake Regillus,\r\nafter which the Roman knights, richly clothed, crowned with olive, and\r\nbearing their trophies, rode past it in military procession, starting\r\nfrom the temple of Mars outside the Porta Capena. The entablature which\r\nthe three columns support is of great richness, and the whole fragment\r\nis considered to be one of the finest existing specimens of the\r\nCorinthian order. None of the Roman ruins have given rise to more\r\ndiscussion than this. It has perpetually changed its name. Bunsen and\r\nmany other authorities considered it to belong to the temple of Minerva\r\nChalcidica; but as it is known that the position of the now discovered\r\nBasilica Julia was exactly between the temple of Saturn and that of\r\nCastor, and a passage of Ovid describes the latter as being close to the\r\nsite of the temple of Vesta, which is also ascertained, it seems almost\r\ncertain now that it belonged to the temple of the Dioscuri. Dion-Cassius\r\nmentions that Caligula made this temple a vestibule to his house on the\r\nPalatine.\r\n\r\nHere, on the right, branches off the Via dei Fienili, once the _Vicus\r\nTuscus_, or Etruscan quarter (see Chap. V.), leading to the Circus\r\nMaximus. At its entrance was the bronze statue of Vertumnus, the god of\r\nEtruria, and patron of the quarter. The long trough-shaped fountain\r\nhere, at which such picturesque groups of oxen and buffaloes are\r\nconstantly standing, is a memorial of the _Lake of Juturna_ the sister\r\nof Turnus, or as she was sometimes described, the wife of Janus the\r\nSabine war-god. This fountain, for such it must have been, was dried up\r\nby Paul V.\r\n\r\n    \"At quæ venturas præcedit sexta kalendas,\r\n      Hac sunt Ledæis templa dicata deis.\r\n    Fratribus illa deis fratres de gente deorum\r\n      Circa Juturnæ composuere lacus.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ i. 705.\r\n\r\nHere, close under the Palatine, is the site of the famous _Temple of\r\nVesta_, in which the sacred fire was preserved, with the palladium saved\r\nfrom Troy. On the altar of this temple, blood was sprinkled annually\r\nfrom the tail of the horse which was sacrificed to Mars in the\r\nCampus-Martius. The foundation of the temple was attributed to Numa, but\r\nthe worship must have existed in Pelasgic times, as the mother of\r\nRomulus was a vestal. It was burnt down in the fire of Nero, rebuilt and\r\nagain burnt down under Commodus, and probably restored for the last time\r\nby Heliogabalus. Here, during the consulate of the young Marius, the\r\nhigh priest Scævola was murdered, splashing the image of Vesta with his\r\nblood,--and here (A.D. 68) Piso, the adopted son of Galba, was murdered\r\nin the sanctuary whither he had fled for refuge, and his head, being cut\r\noff, was affixed to the rostra. Behind the temple, along the lower ridge\r\nof the Palatine, stretched the sacred grove of Vesta, and the site of\r\nthe Church of Sta. Maria Liberatrice was occupied by the _Atrium Vestæ_,\r\na kind of convent for the vestal virgins. Here Numa Pompilius fixed his\r\nresidence, hoping to conciliate both the Latins of the Palatine and the\r\nSabines of the Capitoline by occupying a neutral ground between them.\r\n\r\n    \"Quæris iter? dicam, vicinum Castora, canæ\r\n      Transibis Vestæ, virgineamque domum,\r\n    Inde sacro veneranda petes palatia Clivo.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, i. _Ep._ 70.\r\n\r\n    \"Hic focus est Vestæ, qui Pallada servat et ignem.\r\n      Hic fuit antiqui regia parva Numæ.\"\r\n         _Ovid, Trist._ iii. _El._ 1.\r\n\r\n    \"Hic locus exiguus, qui sustinet atria Vestæ,\r\n      Tunc erat intonsi regia magna Numæ.\r\n    Forma tamen templi, quae nunc manet, ante fuisse\r\n      Dicitur; et formæ causa probanda subest.\r\n    Vesta eadem est, et Terra; subest vigil ignis utrique,\r\n      Significant sedem terra focusque suam.\r\n    Terra pilæ similis, nullo fulcimine nixa,\r\n      Aëre subjecto tam grave pendet onus.\r\n    Arte Syracosia suspensus in aëre clauso\r\n      Stat globus, immensi parva figura poli;\r\n    Et quantum a summis, tantum secessit ab imis\r\n      Terra. Quod ut fiat, forma rotunda facit.\r\n    Par facies templi: nullus procurrit ab illo\r\n      Angulus. A pluvio vindicat imbre tholus.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ vi. 263.\r\n\r\n    \"Servat et Alba, Lares, et quorum lucet in aris\r\n    Ignis adhuc Phrygius, nullique adspecta virorum\r\n    Pallas, in abstruso pignus memorabile templo.\"\r\n\r\n    _Lucan_, ix. 992.\r\n\r\nClose to the temple of Vesta was the _Regia_, where Julius Cæsar lived\r\n(as pontifex maximus)--where Pompeia his second wife admitted her lover\r\nClodius in the disguise of a woman to the mysteries of the Bona\r\nDea--whence Cæsar went forth to his death--and from which his last wife\r\nCalpurnia rushed forth with loud outcries to receive his dead body.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in this part of the Forum was the famous _Curtian Lake_, so\r\ncalled from Mettus Curtius, a Sabine warrior, who with difficulty\r\nescaped from its quagmires to the Capitol after a battle between Romulus\r\nand Tatius.[52] Tradition declares that the quagmire afterwards became a\r\ngulf, which an oracle declared would never close until that which was\r\nmost important to the Roman people was sacrificed to it. Then the young\r\nMarcus Curtius, equipped in full armour, leapt his horse into the abyss,\r\nexclaiming that nothing was more important to the Roman people than arms\r\nand courage; and the gulf was closed.[53] Two altars were afterwards\r\nerected on the site to the two heroes, and a vine and an olive tree grew\r\nthere.[54]\r\n\r\n    \"Hoc, ubi nunc fora sunt, udæ tenuere paludes:\r\n      Amne redundatis fossa madebat aquis.\r\n    Curtius ille lacus, siccas qui sustinet aras,\r\n      Nunc solida est tellus, sed lacus ante fuit.\"\r\n             _Ovid, Fast._ vi. 401.\r\n\r\nSome fountain, like those of Servilius and Juturna, bearing the name of\r\nLacus Curtius must have existed on this site to imperial times, for the\r\nEmperor Galba was murdered there.\r\n\r\n     \"A single cohort still surrounded Galba, when the standard-bearer\r\n     tore the Emperor's image from his spear-head, and dashed it on the\r\n     ground. The soldiers were at once decided for Otho; swords were\r\n     drawn, and every symptom of favour for Galba amongst the bystanders\r\n     was repressed by menaces, till they dispersed and fled in horror\r\n     from the Forum. At last, the bearers of the emperor's litter\r\n     overturned it at the Curtian pool beneath the Capitol. In a few\r\n     moments enemies swarmed around his body. A few words he muttered,\r\n     which have been diversely reported: some said that they were abject\r\n     and unbecoming; others affirmed that he presented his neck to the\r\n     assassin's sword, and bade him strike 'if it were for the good of\r\n     the republic;' but none listened, none perhaps heeded the words\r\n     actually spoken; Galba's throat was pierced, but even the author of\r\n     his mortal wound was not ascertained, while his breast being\r\n     protected by the cuirass, his legs and arms were hacked with\r\n     repeated gashes.\"--_Merivale_, vii. 73.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Clivus Capitolinus, on the left (looking towards the\r\nArch of Titus) stood the _Temple of Janus Quirinus_, between the great\r\nForum and the Forum of Julius Cæsar, and near the ascent to the Porta\r\nJanualis, by which Tarpeia admitted the Sabines to the Capitol.\r\nProcopius, in the sixth century, saw the little bronze temple of Janus\r\nstill standing. This was one of many temples of the great Sabine god.\r\n\r\n    \"Quum tot sint Jani; cur stas sacratus in uno,\r\n    Hic ubi juncta foris templa duobus habes?\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ i. 257.\r\n\r\nThis was the temple which was the famous index of peace and war, closed\r\nby Augustus for the third time from its foundation after the victory of\r\nActium.[55]\r\n\r\n    \" ...et vacuum duellis\r\n    Janum Quirini clausit, et ordinem\r\n    Rectum, et vaganti fræna licentiæ\r\n    Injecit.\"\r\n\r\n    _Horace_, Ode iv. 15.\r\n\r\nBesides this temple there were three arches, whose sites are unknown,\r\ndedicated to Janus in different parts of the Forum.\r\n\r\n    \" ...Hæc Janus summus ab imo\r\n    Perdocet----\"\r\n\r\n    _Horace, Ep._ i. 1, 54.\r\n\r\nThe central arch was the resort of brokers and money-lenders.[56]\r\n\r\n    \" ...Postquam omnis res mea Janum\r\n    Ad medium fracta est.\"\r\n\r\n    _Hor. Sat._ ii. 3, 18.\r\n\r\nAlong this side of the Forum stood the _Tabernæ Argentariæ_, the\r\nsilversmiths' shops, and beyond them--probably in front of S.\r\nAdriano--were the Tabernæ Novæ, where Virginia was stabbed by her father\r\nwith a butcher's knife, which he had seized from one of the stalls,\r\nsaying, \"This, my child, is the only way to keep thee free,\" as he\r\nplunged it into her heart.[57] Near this also was the statue of Venus\r\nCloacina.[58]\r\n\r\nThe front of the Church of S. Adriano is a fragment of the _Basilica of\r\nÆmilius Paulus_, built with part of 1500 talents which Cæsar had sent\r\nfrom Gaul to win him over to his party. This basilica occupied the site\r\nof the famous _Curia_ of Tullus Hostilius.\r\n\r\n     \"Là se réunit, pour la première fois sous un toit, le conseil des\r\n     anciens rois que le savant Properce, avec un sentiment vrai des\r\n     antiquités romaines, nous montre tel qu'il était dans l'origine, se\r\n     rassemblant au son de la trompe pastorale dans un pré, comme le\r\n     peuple dans certains petits cantons de la Suisse.\"--_Ampère, Hist.\r\n     Rom._ ii. 310.\r\n\r\nThe Curia was capable of containing six hundred senators, their number\r\nin the time of the Gracchi. It had no tribune,--each speaker rose in\r\nturn and spoke in his place. Here was \"the hall of assembly in which the\r\nfate of the world was decided.\" The Curia was destroyed by fire, which\r\nit caught from the funeral pyre of Clodius. Around the Curia stood many\r\nstatues of Romans who had rendered especial service to the state. The\r\nCuria Julia occupied the site of the Curia Hostilia in the early part of\r\nthe reign of Augustus. Close by the old Curia was the _Basilica Porcia_,\r\nbuilt by Cato the Censor, which was likewise burnt down at the funeral\r\nof Clodius. Near this, the base of the rostral column, _Colonna Duilia_,\r\nhas been found.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Basilica Julia, in the depth of the Forum, is the _Column\r\nof Phocas_, raised to that emperor by the exarch Smaragdus in 608. This\r\nis--\r\n\r\n    \"The nameless column with a buried base,\"\r\n\r\nof Byron, but is now neither nameless nor buried, its pedestal having\r\nbeen laid bare by the Duchess of Devonshire in 1813, and bearing an\r\ninscription which shows an origin that no one ever anticipated.\r\n\r\n     \"In the age of Phocas (602--610), the art of erecting a column like\r\n     that of Trajan or M. Aurelius had been lost. A large and handsome\r\n     Corinthian pillar, taken from some temple or basilica, was\r\n     therefore placed in the Forum, on a huge pyramidal basis quite out\r\n     of proportion to it, and was surmounted with a statue of Phocas in\r\n     gilt bronze. It has so little the appearance of a monumental\r\n     column, that for a long while it was thought to belong to some\r\n     ruined building, till, in 1813, the inscription was discovered. The\r\n     name of Phocas had, indeed, been erased; but that it must have been\r\n     dedicated to him is shown by the date.... The base of this column,\r\n     discovered by the excavations of 1816 to have rested on the ancient\r\n     pavement of the Forum, proves that this former centre of Roman life\r\n     was still, at the beginning of the seventh century, unencumbered\r\n     with ruins.\"--_Dyer's History of the City of Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"Ce monument et l'inscription qui l'accompagne sont précieux pour\r\n     l'histoire, car ils montrent le dernier terme de l'avilissement où\r\n     Rome devait tomber. Smaragdus est le premier magistrat de\r\n     Rome,--mais ce magistrat est un préfet, l'élu du pouvoir impérial\r\n     et non de ses concitoyens;--il commande, non, il est vrai, à la\r\n     capitale du monde, mais au chef-lieu du duché de Rome. Ce préfet,\r\n     qui n'est connu de l'histoire que par ses lâches ménagements envers\r\n     les Barbares, imagine de voler une colonne à un beau temple, au\r\n     temple d'un empereur de quelque mérite, pour la dédier à un\r\n     exécrable tyran monté sur le trône par des assassinats, au\r\n     meurtrier de l'empereur Maurice, à l'ignoble Phocas, que tout le\r\n     monde connaît, grâce à Corneille, qui l'a encore trop ménagé. Et le\r\n     plat drôle ose appeler très-clément celui qui fit égorger sous les\r\n     yeux de Maurice ses quatre fils avant de l'égorger lui-même. Il\r\n     décerne le titre de triomphateur à Phocas, qui laissa conquérir par\r\n     Chosroès une bonne part de l'empire. Il ose écrire: 'pour les\r\n     innombrables bienfaits de sa piété, pour le repos procuré à\r\n     l'Italie et à la liberté.' Ainsi l'histoire monumentale de la Rome\r\n     de l'empire finit honteusement par un hommage ridicule de la\r\n     bassesse à la violence.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 389.\r\n\r\nA little behind the Column of Phocas are the marble slabs commemorating\r\nthe sacrifices called Suovetaurilia, consisting of a pig, a sheep, and\r\nan ox, animals which are sculptured here in bold relief. On the side\r\ntowards the Capitol a number of figures are represented, amongst them a\r\nwoman presenting a child to the emperor, in reference to Trajan's asylum\r\nfor orphans, or for those who were too poor to bring up their children.\r\nOn the other side is a burning of deeds in reference to the famous\r\nremission of debts by Trajan.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, on the left, the base of the famous statue of Domitian has\r\nbeen discovered as described by Statius:\r\n\r\n    \"Ipse loci custos, cujus sacrata vorago,\r\n    Famosusque lacus nomen memorabile servat.\"\r\n\r\n    _Silv._ i. 66.\r\n\r\nHere the Via Sacra turns, almost continuing the Vicus Tuscus. On its\r\nright, on a line with the Temple of the Dioscuri, has been discovered\r\nthe base of the small Temple of Julius Cæsar (Ædes Divi Julii),[59]\r\nwhich was surrounded with a colonnade of closely-placed columns and\r\nsurmounted by a statue of the deified triumvir. This was the first\r\ntemple in Rome which was dedicated to a mortal.\r\n\r\n    \"Fratribus assimilis, quos proxima templa tenentes\r\n    Divus ab excelsa Julius æde videt.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Pont. El._ ii. 2.\r\n\r\nDion Cassius narrates that this temple was erected on the spot where the\r\nbody of Julius was burnt. It was adorned by Augustus with the beaks of\r\nthe vessels taken in the battle of Actium, and hence obtained the name\r\nof Rostra Julia. He also placed here the statue of Venus Anadyomene of\r\nApelles, because Cæsar had claimed descent from that goddess. Here, in\r\nA.D. 14, the body of Augustus, being brought from Nola, where he died,\r\nwas placed upon a bier, while Tiberius pronounced a funeral oration over\r\nit, before it was carried to the Campus Martius.\r\n\r\nThe road turns again in front of the remains of the _Temple of Antoninus\r\nand Faustina_, erected by the flattery of the senate to the memory of\r\nthe licentious Empress Faustina, the faithless wife of Antoninus Pius,\r\nwhom they elevated to the rank of a goddess. Her husband, dying before\r\nits completion, was associated in her honours, and the inscription,\r\nwhich still remains on the portico, is \"DIVO ANTONINO ET DIVÆ FAUSTINÆ.\r\nEX. S. C.\" The front of the temple is adorned with eight columns of\r\ncipolino, forty-three feet high, supporting a frieze ornamented with\r\ngriffins and candelabra. The effect of these remains would be\r\nmagnificent if the modern road were removed, and the temple were laid\r\nbare in its full height, with the twenty-one steps which formerly led to\r\nit. It is also greatly injured by the hideous Church of S. Lorenzo in\r\nMiranda, which encloses the cella of the temple, and whose name, says\r\nAmpère, naively expresses the admiration in which its builders held\r\nthese remains.[60]\r\n\r\nOn the left we now reach the Church of SS. Cosmo and Damian, considered\r\nby Nibby and others to occupy the site of a temple of Remus. Ampère has\r\nsince proved that this temple never existed, and that the remains are\r\nthose of a _Temple of the Penates_, rebuilt by Augustus. Here Valerius\r\nPublicola had a house, to which he removed from the Velia, in deference\r\nto the wishes of the Roman people.\r\n\r\n     \"Le sentiment d'effroi que la demeure féodale des Valérius causait,\r\n     était pareille à celui qu'inspiraient aux Romains du moyen âge les\r\n     tours des barons, que le peuple, dès qu'il était le maître, se\r\n     hâtait de démolir. Valerius n'attendit pas qu'on se portât à cette\r\n     extrémité, et il vint habiter au pied de la Velia. C'est le premier\r\n     triomphe des plébéiens sur l'aristocratie romaine et la première\r\n     concession de cette aristocratie.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ ii. 274.\r\n\r\nA little further on are three gigantic arches, being all that remains of\r\nthe magnificent _Basilica of Constantine_, which was 320 feet in length\r\nand 235 feet in width. The existing ruins are those of one of the aisles\r\nof the basilica. There are traces of an entrance towards the Coliseum.\r\nThe roof was supported by eight Corinthian columns, of which one,\r\nremaining here till the time of Paul V., was removed by him to the\r\npiazza of Sta. Maria Maggiore, where it still stands. This site was\r\npreviously occupied by the _Temple of Peace_, burnt down in the time of\r\nCommodus. This temple was the great museum of Rome under the empire, and\r\ncontained the seven-branched candlestick and other treasures brought\r\nfrom Jerusalem,[61] as well as all the works of art which had been\r\ncollected in the palace of Nero and which were removed hither by\r\nVespasian. A statue of the Nile, with children playing around it, is\r\nmentioned by Pliny as among the sights in the temple of Peace.[62]\r\n\r\nIt was near this that the Via Sacra was crossed by the _Arch of Fabius_,\r\nerected B.C. 121, in honour of the conqueror of the Allobroges,--the\r\nthen inhabitants of Savoy. Close to this portion of the Via Sacra also\r\nstood a statue of Valeria, daughter of Publicola, by whom the honours of\r\nthe virgin Clœlia were disputed.\r\n\r\nBesides those which we have noticed, there is mention in classical\r\nauthors of many other buildings and statues which were once crowded into\r\nthis narrow space; but all trace of many even of those enumerated is\r\nstill buried many feet below the soil.\r\n\r\nThe modern name of _Campo Vaccino_, by which the Forum is now known, is\r\nsupposed by some antiquaries to be derived from Vitruvius Vacco, who\r\nonce had a house there.\r\n\r\n     \"La guerre aux habitants de Privernum (Piperno) rattache à une\r\n     localité du Palatin.... Les habitants de Fondi avaient fait cause\r\n     commune avec les habitants de Privernum. Leur chef, Vitruvius\r\n     Vacca, possedait une maison sur le Palatin; c'était un homme\r\n     considérable dans son pays et même à Rome. Ils demandèrent et\r\n     obtinrent grâce. Privernum fut pris, et Vitruvius Vacca, qui s'y\r\n     était réfugié, conduit à Rome, enfermé dans le prison Mamertine\r\n     pour y être gardé jusqu'au retour du consul, et alors battu de\r\n     verges et mis à mort; sa maison du Palatin fut rasée, et le lieu où\r\n     elle avait été garda le nom de _Prés de Vacca_.\"--_Ampère, Histoire\r\n     Romaine_, iii. 17.\r\n\r\nBut the name will seem singularly appropriate to those who are familiar\r\nwith the groups of meek-faced oxen of the Campagna, which are always to\r\nbe seen lying in the shade under the trees of the Forum, or drinking at\r\nits water-troughs.\r\n\r\n     \"'Romanoque Foro et lautis mugire Carinis.'\r\n\r\n     \"Ce vers m'a toujours profondément frappé, lorsque je traversais le\r\n     Forum, aujourd'hui Campo-Vaccino (le champ du bétail); je voyais\r\n     en effet presque toujours à son extrémité des bœufs couchés au\r\n     pied du Palatin. Virgile, se reportant de la Rome de son temps à la\r\n     Rome ancienne d'Evandre, ne trouvait pas d'image plus frappante du\r\n     changement produit par les siècles, que la présence d'un troupeau\r\n     de bœufs dans le lieu destiné à être le Forum. Eh bien, le jour\r\n     devait venir où ce qui était pour Virgile un passé lointain et\r\n     presque incroyable se reproduirait dans la suite des âges; le Forum\r\n     devait être de nouveau un lieu agreste, ses magnificences s'en\r\n     aller et les bœufs y revenir.\r\n\r\n     \"J'aimais à les contempler à travers quelques colonnes moins\r\n     vieilles que les souvenirs qu'ils me retracaient, reprenant\r\n     possession de ce sol d'où les avait chassés la liberté, la gloire,\r\n     Cicéron, César, et où devait les ramener la plus grande vicissitude\r\n     de l'historie, la destruction de l'empire romain per les barbares.\r\n     Ce que Virgile trouvait si étrange dans le passé n'étonne plus dans\r\n     le présent; les bœufs mugissent au Forum; ils s'y couchent et y\r\n     ruminent aujourd'hui, de même qu'au temps d'Evandre et comme s'il\r\n     n'était rien arrivé.\"--Ampère, Hist. Rom. 1. 211.\r\n\r\n                  \"In many a heap the ground\r\n    Heaves, is if Ruin in a frantic mood\r\n    Had done his utmost. Here and there appears,\r\n    As left to show his handy-work not ours,\r\n    An idle column, a half-buried arch,\r\n    A wall of some great temple. It was once,\r\n    And long, the centre of their Universe,\r\n    The Forum--whence a mandate, eagle-winged,\r\n    Went to the ends of the earth. Let us descend\r\n    Slowly. At every step much may be lost,\r\n    The very dust we tread stirs as with life,\r\n    And not a breath but from the ground sends up\r\n    Something of human grandeur.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Now all is changed; and here, as in the wild,\r\n    The day is silent, dreary as the night;\r\n    None stirring, save the herdsman and his herd,\r\n    Savage alike; or they that would explore,\r\n    Discuss, and learnedly; or they that come,\r\n    (And there are many who have crossed the earth,)\r\n    That they may give the hours to meditation,\r\n    And wander, often saving to themselves,\r\n    'This was the Roman Forum!'\"\r\n\r\n    _Rogers' Italy._\r\n\r\n     \"We descended into the Forum, the light fast fading away and\r\n     throwing a kindred soberness over the scene of ruin. The soil has\r\n     risen from rubbish at least fifteen feet, so that no wonder that\r\n     the hills look lower than they used to do, having been never very\r\n     considerable at the first. There it was one scene of desolation,\r\n     from the massy foundation-stones of the Capitoline Temple, which\r\n     were laid by Tarquinius the Proud, to a single pillar erected in\r\n     honour of Phocas, the eastern emperor, in the fifth century. What\r\n     the fragments of pillars belonged to, perhaps we can never know;\r\n     but that I think matters little. I care not whether it was a temple\r\n     of Jupiter Stator or the Basilica Julia, but one knows that one is\r\n     on the ground of the Forum, under the Capitol, the place where the\r\n     tribes assembled, and the orators spoke; the scene, in short, of\r\n     all the internal struggles of the Roman people.\"--_Arnold's\r\n     Journal._\r\n\r\n     \"They passed the solitary column of Phocas, and looked down into\r\n     the excavated space, where a confusion of pillars, arches,\r\n     pavements, and shattered blocks and shafts--the crumbs of various\r\n     ruins dropt from the devouring maw of Time--stand, or lie, at the\r\n     base of the Capitoline Hill. That renowned hillock (for it is\r\n     little more) now rose abruptly above them. The ponderous masonry,\r\n     with which the hillside is built up, is as old as Rome itself, and\r\n     looks likely to endure while the world retains any substance or\r\n     permanence. It once sustained the Capitol, and now bears up the\r\n     great pile which the mediæval builders raised on the antique\r\n     foundation, and that still loftier tower, which looks abroad upon a\r\n     larger page of deeper historic interest than any other scene can\r\n     show. On the same pedestal of Roman masonry, other structures will\r\n     doubtless arise, and vanish like ephemeral things.\r\n\r\n     \"To a spectator on the spot, it is remarkable that the events of\r\n     Roman history, and of Roman life itself, appear not so distant as\r\n     the Gothic ages which succeeded them. We stand in the Forum, or on\r\n     the height of the Capitol, and seem to see the Roman epoch close at\r\n     hand. We forget that a chasm extends between it and ourselves, in\r\n     which lie all those dark, rude, unlettered centuries, around the\r\n     birthtime of Christianity, as well as the age of chivalry and\r\n     romance, the feudal system, and the infancy of a better\r\n     civilization than that of Rome. Or, if we remember these mediæval\r\n     times, they look further off than the Augustan age. The reason may\r\n     be, that the old Roman literature survives, and creates for us an\r\n     intimacy with the classic ages, which we have no means of forming\r\n     with the subsequent ones.\r\n\r\n     \"The Italian climate, moreover, robs age of its reverence, and\r\n     makes it look nearer than it is. Not the Coliseum, nor the tombs of\r\n     the Appian Way, nor the oldest pillar in the Forum, nor any other\r\n     Roman ruin, be it as dilapidated as it may, ever give the\r\n     impression of venerable antiquity which we gather, along with the\r\n     ivy, from the grey walls of an English abbey or castle. And yet\r\n     every brick and stone, which we pick up among the former, had\r\n     fallen, ages before the foundation of the latter was\r\n     begun.\"--_Hawthorne, Transformation._\r\n\r\n     \"A Rome, vous marchez sur les pierres qui ont été les dieux de\r\n     César et de Pompée: vous considérez la ruine de ces grands\r\n     ouvrages, dont la vieillesse est encore belle, et vous vous\r\n     promènerez tous les jours parmi les histoires et les fables....

Martina_, which contains the original model,\r\nbequeathed by the sculptor Thorwaldsen, of his Copenhagen statue of\r\nChrist in the act of benediction. The opposite transept contains a very\r\ninferior statue of Religion by _Canova_. The figure of Sta. Martina by\r\n_Guerini_ reposes beneath the high altar. The subterranean church is\r\nwell worth visiting. An ante-chapel adorned with statues of four virgin\r\nmartyrs leads to a chapel erected at the cost and from the designs of\r\nPietro da Cortona, whose tomb stands near its entrance, with a fine bust\r\nby _Bernini_. In the centre of the inner chapel lamps are burning round\r\nthe magnificent bronze altar which covers the shrine of Sta. Martina,\r\nand beneath it, you can discover the martyr's tomb by the light of a\r\ntorch which a monk lets down through a hole. In the tribune is an\r\nancient throne. A side chapel contains the grave in which the body of\r\nthe virgin saint, with three other martyrs, her companions, was found in\r\n1634: it is adorned with a fine bas-relief by _Algardi_.\r\n\r\n     \"At the foot of the Capitoline hill, on the left hand as we descend\r\n     from the Ara Cœli into the Forum, there stood in very ancient\r\n     times a small chapel dedicated to Sta. Martina, a Roman virgin, who\r\n     was martyred in the persecution under Alexander Severus. The\r\n     veneration paid to her was of very early date, and the Roman people\r\n     were accustomed to assemble there on the first day of the year.\r\n     This observance was, however, confined to the people, and not very\r\n     general till 1634; an era which connects her in rather an\r\n     interesting manner with the history of art. In this year, as they\r\n     were about to repair her chapel, they discovered, walled into the\r\n     foundations, a sarcophagus of terra-cotta, in which was the body of\r\n     a young female, whose severed head reposed in a separate casket.\r\n     These remains were very naturally supposed to be those of the saint\r\n     who had been so long venerated on that spot. The discovery was\r\n     hailed with the utmost exultation, not by the people only, but by\r\n     those who led the minds and consciences of the people. The pope\r\n     himself, Urban VIII., composed hymns in her praise; and Cardinal\r\n     Francesco Barberini undertook to rebuild her church. Amongst those\r\n     who shared the general enthusiasm was the painter, Pietro da\r\n     Cortona, who was at Rome at the time, who very earnestly dedicated\r\n     himself and his powers to the glorification of Sta. Martina. Her\r\n     church had already been given to the Academy of Painters, and\r\n     consecrated to St. Luke, their patron saint. It is now 'San Luca\r\n     and Santa Martina.' Pietro da Cortona erected at his own cost, the\r\n     chapel of Sta. Martina, and when he died, endowed it with his whole\r\n     fortune. He painted for the altarpiece his best picture, in which\r\n     the saint is represented as triumphing over the idols, while the\r\n     temple in which she has been led to sacrifice, is struck by\r\n     lightning from heaven, and falls in ruins around her. In a votive\r\n     picture of Sta. Martina kneeling at the feet of the Virgin and\r\n     Child, she is represented as very young and lovely; near her, a\r\n     horrid instrument of torture, a two-pronged fork with barbed\r\n     extremities, and the lictor's axe, signifying the manner of her\r\n     death.\"--_Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art._\r\n\r\nThe feast of the saint is observed here on Jan. 30, with much solemnity.\r\nThen in all the Roman churches is sung the Hymn of Sta. Martina--\r\n\r\n    \"Martinæ celebri plaudite nomini,\r\n    Cives Romulei, plaudite gloriæ;\r\n    Insignem mentis dicite virginem,\r\n    Christi dicite martyrem.\r\n\r\n    Hæc dum conspicuis orta parentibus\r\n    Inter delicias, inter amabiles\r\n    Luxus illecebras, ditibus affluit\r\n    Faustæ muneribus domus.\r\n\r\n    Vitæ despiciens commoda, dedicat\r\n    Se rerum Domino, et munifica manu\r\n    Christi pauperibus distribuens opes\r\n    Quærit præmia cœlitum.\r\n\r\n    A nobis abigas lubrica gaudia\r\n    Tu, qui martyribus dexter ades,\r\n    Deus\r\n    Une et trine: tuis da famulis jubar,\r\n    Quo clemens animos beas. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing especial to notice in _S. Adriano_, which is built in\r\nthe ruins of the basilica of Emilius Paulus, or in _S. Lorenzo in\r\nMiranda_, which occupies the temple of Antoninus and Faustina, but _Sta.\r\nMaria Liberatrice_, built on the site of the house of Numa and the\r\nconvent of the Vestals, commemorates by its name a curious legend of the\r\nfourth century. On this site, it is said, dwelt in a cave, a terrible\r\ndragon who had slain three hundred persons with the poison of his\r\nbreath. Into this cave, instructed thereto by St. Peter, and entrusting\r\nhimself to the care of the Virgin, descended St. Silvester the Pope,\r\nattended by two acolytes bearing torches, and here, having pronounced\r\nthe name of Christ, he was miraculously enabled to bind the dragon, and\r\nto shut him up till the day of Judgment. But when he ascended in safety,\r\nhe found at the mouth of the cave two magicians who had followed him in\r\nthe hope of discovering some imposture, dying from the poison of the\r\ndragon's breath,--and these also he saved alive.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the circular building which has been so long known as the\r\ntemple of Remus. To the right of the entrance are two pillars of\r\ncipolino, almost buried in the soil. The porphyry pillars at the\r\nentrance, supporting a richly sculptured cornice, were probably set up\r\nin their present position when the temple was turned into a church. The\r\nbronze doors were brought from Perugia. If, as is now supposed, the\r\ntemple on this site was that of the Penates, the protectors against all\r\nkinds of illness and misfortune, the modern dedication to the protecting\r\nphysicians Cosmo and Damian may have had some reference to that which\r\nwent before.\r\n\r\nThe Church of _SS. Cosmo and Damiano_ was founded within the ancient\r\ntemple by Pope Felix IV. in 527, and restored by Adrian I. in 780. In\r\n1633 the whole building was modernized by Urban VIII., who, in order to\r\nraise it to the present level of the soil, cut the ancient church in\r\nhalf by the vaulting which now divides the upper and lower churches. To\r\nvisit the lower church a monk must be summoned, who will bring a torch.\r\nThis is well worth while. It is of great size, and contains a curious\r\nwell into which Christian martyrs in the time of Nero are said to have\r\nbeen precipitated. The tomb of the martyrs Cosmo and Damian is beneath\r\nthe altar, which is formed of beautiful transparent marble. Under a side\r\naltar is the grave of Felix IV. The third and lowest church (the\r\n_original_ crypt) which is very small, is said to have been a place of\r\nrefuge during the early Christian persecutions. Here is shown the altar\r\nat which Felix IV. celebrated mass while his converts were hiding\r\nhere--the grave in which the body of the pope was afterwards\r\ndiscovered--and a miraculous spring, still flowing, which is said to\r\nhave burst forth in answer to his prayers that he might have wherewithal\r\nto baptize his disciples. A passage which formerly led from hence to the\r\nCatacombs of St. Sebastian, was walled up, twenty years ago, by the\r\npaternal government, because twenty persons were lost in it. In this\r\ncrypt were found the famous \"Pianta Capitolina,\" now preserved in the\r\nCapitol. In the upper church, on the right of the entrance from the\r\ncircular vestibule into the body of the building is this inscription--\r\n\r\n     \"L'imagine di Madonna Santissima che esiste all'altar magg. parlò a\r\n     S. Gregorio Papa dicendogli, 'Perchè piu non mi saluti mentre\r\n     passando eri solito salutarmi?' Il santo domandò perdona e concesse\r\n     a quelli che celebrano in quell'altare la liberazione dell'anima\r\n     dal purgatorio, cioé per quell'anima per la quale si celebra la\r\n     messa.\"[63]\r\n\r\nAnother inscription narrates--\r\n\r\n     \"Gregorius primus concessit omnibus et singulis visitantibus\r\n     ecclesiam istam sanctorum Cosmæ et Damiani mille annos de\r\n     indulgentia, et in die stationis ejusdem ecclesiæ idem Gregorius\r\n     concessit decem millia annorum de indulgentia.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many relics preserved in this church are, \"Una ampulla lactis\r\nBeatæ Mariæ Virginis\"; \"De Domo Sanctæ Mariæ Magdalenæ\"; \"De Domo Sancti\r\nZachariæ profeta!\"\r\n\r\nDeserving of the most minute attention is the grand mosaic of\r\nChrist--coming on the clouds of sunset.\r\n\r\n     \"The mosaics of SS. Cosmo and Damian (A.D. 526--530) are the finest\r\n     of ancient Christian Rome. Above the arch appear, on each side of\r\n     the Lamb, four angels, of excellent but somewhat severe style; then\r\n     follow various apocalyptic emblems: a modern walling up having left\r\n     but few traces of the four and twenty elders. A gold surface,\r\n     dimmed by age, with little purple clouds, forms the background:\r\n     though in Rome, at least, at both an earlier and later date, a blue\r\n     ground prevailed. In the apsis itself, upon a dark blue ground,\r\n     with golden-edged clouds, is seen the colossal figure of Christ;\r\n     the right hand raised, either in benediction or teaching, the left\r\n     holding a written scroll; above is the hand, which is the emblem of\r\n     the First Person of the Trinity. Below, on each side, the apostles\r\n     Peter and Paul are leading SS. Cosmo and Damiano, each with crowns\r\n     on their heads, towards the Saviour, followed by St. Theodore on\r\n     the right, and by Pope Felix IV., the founder of the church, on the\r\n     left. This latter, unfortunately, is an entirely restored figure.\r\n     Two palm-trees, sparkling with gold, above one of which appears the\r\n     emblem of eternity, the phœnix--with a star-shaped nimbus, close\r\n     the composition on each side. Further below, indicated by\r\n     water-plants, sparkling also with gold, is the river Jordan. The\r\n     figure of Christ may be regarded as one of the most marvellous\r\n     specimens of the art of the middle ages. Countenance, attitude, and\r\n     drapery combine to give him an expression of quiet majesty, which,\r\n     for many centuries after, is not found again in equal beauty and\r\n     freedom. The drapery, especially, is disposed in noble folds, and\r\n     only in its somewhat too ornate details is a further departure from\r\n     the antique observable. The saints are not as yet arranged in stiff\r\n     parallel forms, but are advancing forward, so that their figures\r\n     appear somewhat distorted, while we already remark something\r\n     constrained and inanimate in their step. The apostles Peter and\r\n     Paul wear the usual ideal costume. SS. Cosmo and Damiano are\r\n     attired in the late Roman dress: violet mantles, in gold stuff,\r\n     with red embroideries of oriental barbaric effect. Otherwise the\r\n     chief motives of the drapery are of great beauty, though somewhat\r\n     too abundant in folds. The high lights are brought out by gold and\r\n     other sparkling materials, producing a gorgeous play of colour\r\n     which relieves the figures vigorously from the dark blue\r\n     background. Altogether, a feeling for colour is here displayed, of\r\n     which no later mosaics with gold grounds give any idea. The heads,\r\n     with the exception of the principal figure, are animated and\r\n     individual, though without any particular depth of expression;\r\n     somewhat elderly, also, in physiognomy, but still far removed from\r\n     any Byzantine stiffness; St. Peter has already the bald head, and\r\n     St. Paul the short brown hair and dark beard, by which they were\r\n     afterwards recognizable. Under this chief composition, on a gold\r\n     ground, is seen the Lamb upon a hill, with the four rivers of\r\n     Paradise, and the twelve sheep on either hand. The great care of\r\n     execution is seen in the five or six gradations of tints which the\r\n     artist has adopted.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nSS. Cosmo and Damian, to whom this church is dedicated, were two Arabian\r\nphysicians who exercised their art from charity. They suffered under\r\nDiocletian. \"First they were thrown into the sea, but an angel saved\r\nthem; and then into the fire, but the fire refused to burn them; then\r\nthey were bound to crosses and stoned, but the stones either fell\r\nharmless or rebounded on their executioners and killed them, so then the\r\npro-consul Lycias, believing them to be sorcerers, commanded that they\r\nshould be beheaded, and thus they died.\" SS. Cosmo and Damian were the\r\npatron saints of the Medici, and their gilt statues were carried in\r\nstate at the coronation of Leo X. (Giovanni de' Medici). Their fame is\r\ngeneral in many parts of France, where their fête is celebrated by a\r\nvillage fair--children who ask for their fairing of a toy or gingerbread\r\ncalling it their \"St. Côme.\"\r\n\r\n     \"It is related that a certain man, who was afflicted with a cancer\r\n     in his leg, went to perform his devotions in the Church SS. Cosmo\r\n     and Damian at Rome, and he prayed most earnestly that these\r\n     beneficent saints would be pleased to aid him. When he had prayed,\r\n     a deep sleep fell upon him. Then he beheld St. Cosmo and St.\r\n     Damian, who stood beside him; and one carried a box of ointments,\r\n     and the other a sharp knife. And one said, 'What shall we do to\r\n     replace this diseased leg when we have cut it off?' And the other\r\n     replied, 'There is a Moor who has been buried just now at St.\r\n     Pietro in Vincoli; let us take his leg for the purpose.' So they\r\n     brought the leg of the dead man, and with it they replaced the leg\r\n     of the sick man; anointing it with celestial ointment, so that he\r\n     remained whole. When he awoke he almost doubted whether it could be\r\n     himself; but his neighbours, seeing that he was healed, looked into\r\n     the tomb of the Moor, and found that there had been an exchange of\r\n     legs: and thus the truth of this great miracle was proved to all\r\n     beholders.\"--_Mrs. Jameson, from the Legenda Aurea._\r\n\r\nJust beyond the basilica of Constantine, stands the _Church of Sta.\r\nFrancesca Romana_, which is full of interest. It was first built by St.\r\nSylvester on the site of the temple of Venus and dedicated to the\r\nVirgin, under the title of Sta. Maria Antica. It was rebuilt in A.D. 872\r\nby John VIII., who resided in the adjoining monastery during his\r\npontificate. An ancient picture attributed to St. Luke, brought from\r\nTroy in 1100, was the only object in this church which was preserved\r\nwhen the building was totally destroyed by fire in 1216, after which the\r\nchurch, then called Sta. Maria Nuova, was restored by Honorius III.\r\nDuring the restoration, the picture was kept at S. Adriano, and its\r\nbeing brought back led to a contest amongst the people, which was ended\r\nby a child exclaiming--\"What are you doing? the Madonna is already in\r\nher own church.\" She had betaken herself thither none knew how.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century the church was given to the Lateran Canons, in\r\nthe fourteenth to the Olivetan monks; under Eugenius IV., the latter\r\nextended their boundaries so far that they included the Coliseum, but\r\ntheir walls were forced down in the succeeding pontificate. Gregory XI.,\r\nPaul II., and Cæsar Borgia, were cardinals of Sta. Maria Novella. In\r\n1440 the name was changed to that of Sta. Francesca Romana, when that\r\nsaint, Francesca de' Ponziani, foundress of the Order of Oblates, was\r\nburied here. Her tomb was erected in 1640 by Donna Agata Pamfili, sister\r\nof Innocent X., herself an Oblate. It is from the designs of Bernini,\r\nand is rich in marbles. The figure was not added till 1868.\r\n\r\n     \"After the death of Francesca, her body remained during a night and\r\n     a day at the Ponziani Palace, the Oblates watching by turns over\r\n     the beloved remains.... Francesca's face, which had recently borne\r\n     traces of age and suffering, became as beautiful again as in the\r\n     days of youth and prosperity; and the astonished bystanders gazed\r\n     with wonder and awe at her unearthly loveliness. Many of them\r\n     carried away particles from her clothes, and employed them for the\r\n     cure of several persons who had been considered beyond the\r\n     possibility of recovery. In the course of the day the crowd\r\n     augmented to a degree which alarmed the inhabitants of the palace,\r\n     Battista Ponziani took measures to have the body removed at once to\r\n     the church, and a procession of the regular and secular clergy\r\n     escorted the venerated remains to Santa Maria Nuova, where they\r\n     were to be interred.\r\n\r\n     \"The popular feeling burst forth on the occasion; it was no longer\r\n     to be restrained. Francesca was invoked by the crowd, and her\r\n     beloved name was heard in every street, in every piazza, in every\r\n     corner of the Eternal City. It flew from mouth to mouth, it seemed\r\n     to float in the air, to be borne aloft by the grateful enthusiasm\r\n     of a whole people, who had seen her walk to that church by her\r\n     mother's side in her holy childhood; who had seen her kneel at that\r\n     altar in the grave beauty of womanhood, in the hour of bereavement,\r\n     and now in death, carried thither in state, she the gentle, the\r\n     humble saint of Rome, the poor woman of the Trastevere, as she was\r\n     sometimes called at her own desire.\"--_Lady G. Fullerton's Life of\r\n     Sta. Francesca Romana._\r\n\r\nA chapel on the right of the church contains the monument of Cardinal\r\nVulcani, 1322, supporting his figure, with Faith, Hope, and Charity\r\nsculptured in high relief below. Near the door is that of Cardinal\r\nAdimari, 1432, who died here after an ineffectual mission to the\r\nanti-pope Pedro da' Luna. In the left transept was a fine Perugino\r\n(removed 1867); in the right transept is the tomb of Pope Gregory XI.,\r\nby Pietro Paolo Olivieri, erected by the senate in gratitude for his\r\nhaving restored the papal court to Rome from Avignon. A bas-relief\r\nrepresents his triumphal entry, with St. Catherine of Siena, by whose\r\nentreaties he was induced to return, walking before his mule. A breach\r\nin the walls indicates the ruinous state into which Rome had fallen, the\r\nchair of St. Peter is represented as floating back through the air,\r\nwhile an angel carries the papal tiara and keys; a metaphorical figure\r\nof Rome is coming forth to welcome the pope.\r\n\r\n     \"The greatest part of the praise due to Gregory's return to Rome\r\n     belongs to St. Catherine of Siena, who, with infinite courage,\r\n     travelled to Avignon, and persuaded the pope to return, and by his\r\n     presence to dispel the evils which disgraced Italy, in consequence\r\n     of the absence of the popes. Thus it is not to be wondered at, that\r\n     those writers, who rightly understand the matter, should have said\r\n     that Catherine, the virgin of Siena, brought back to God the\r\n     abandoned apostolical chair upon her shoulders.\"--_Ughelli, Ital.\r\n     Sacra_, vi. col. 45.\r\n\r\nNear Pope Gregory's tomb some blackened marks in the wall are shown as\r\nholes made by the (gigantic) knees of St. Peter, when he knelt to pray\r\nthat Simon Magus might be dropped by the demons he had invoked to\r\nsupport him in the air, which he is said to have done to show his power\r\non this spot.\r\n\r\n     \"When the error of Simon was spreading farther and farther, the\r\n     illustrious pair of men, Peter and Paul, the rulers of the Church,\r\n     arrested it by going thither, who suddenly exhibited as dead,\r\n     Simon, the putative God, on his appearance. For when Simon declared\r\n     that he would ascend aloft into heaven, the servants of God cast\r\n     him headlong to the earth, and though this occurrence was wonderful\r\n     in itself, it was not wonderful under the circumstances, for it was\r\n     Peter who did it, he who bears with him the keys of heaven, ... it\r\n     was Paul who did it, he who was caught up into the third\r\n     heaven.\"--_St. Cyril of Jerusalem._\r\n\r\n     \"Simon promised to fly, and thus ascend to the heavenly abodes. On\r\n     the day agreed upon, he went to the Capitoline hill, and throwing\r\n     himself from the rock, began his ascent. Then Peter, standing in\r\n     the midst, said, 'O Lord Jesus, show him that his arts are in\r\n     vain.' Hardly had the words been uttered, when the wings which\r\n     Simon had made use of became entangled, and he fell. His thigh was\r\n     fractured, never to be healed,--and some time afterwards, the\r\n     unhappy man died at Aretia, whither he had retired after his\r\n     discomfiture.\"--_St. Ambrose._[64]\r\n\r\n     \"There can be no doubt that there existed in the first century a\r\n     Simon, a Samaritan, a pretender to divine authority and\r\n     supernatural powers; who, for a time, had many followers; who stood\r\n     in a certain relation to Christianity; and who may have held some\r\n     opinions more or less similar to those entertained by the most\r\n     famous heretics of the early ages, the Gnostics. Irenæus calls this\r\n     Simon the father of all heretics. 'All those,' he says, 'who in any\r\n     way corrupt the truth, or mar the preaching of the Church, are\r\n     disciples and successors of Simon, the Samaritan magician.' Simon\r\n     gave himself forth as a God, and carried about with him a beautiful\r\n     woman named Helena, whom he represented as the first conception of\r\n     his--that is, of the divine--mind, the symbol and manifestation of\r\n     that portion of spirituality which had become entangled in\r\n     matter.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 204.\r\n\r\nThe vault of the tribune is covered with mosaics.\r\n\r\n     \"The restored tribune mosaics (A.D. 858--887, during the\r\n     pontificate of Nicholas I.), close the list of Roman Byzantine\r\n     works. By their time it had become apparent that such figures as\r\n     the art of the day was alone able to achieve, could have no\r\n     possible relation to each other, and therefore no longer constitute\r\n     a composition; the artists accordingly separated the Madonna on the\r\n     throne, and the four saints with uplifted hands, by graceful\r\n     arcades. The ground is gold, the nimbuses blue. The faces consist\r\n     only of feeble lines--the cheeks are only red blotches; the folds\r\n     merely dark strokes; nevertheless a certain flow and fulness in the\r\n     forms, and the character of a few accessories (for instance, the\r\n     exchange of a crown upon the Virgin's head for the invariable\r\n     Byzantine veil), seem to indicate that we have not so much to do\r\n     here with the decline of Byzantine art, as with a northern and\r\n     probably Frankish influence.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nThe convent attached to this church was the abode of Tasso during his\r\nfirst visit to Rome.\r\n\r\nBehind Sta. Francesca Romana, and facing the Coliseum, are the remains\r\ngenerally known as the _Temple of Venus and Rome_, also called Templum\r\nUrbis (now sometimes called by objectors the \"Portico of Livia\"), which,\r\nif this name is the correct one, was originally planned by the Emperor\r\nHadrian to rival the Forum of Trajan, erected by the architect\r\nApollodorus. It was built upon a site previously occupied by the atrium\r\nof Nero's Golden House. Little remains standing except a cella facing\r\nthe Coliseum, and another in the cloisters of the adjoining convent\r\n(these, perhaps, being restorations by Maxentius, _c._ 307, after a fire\r\nhad destroyed most of the building of Hadrian), but the surrounding\r\ngrassy height is positively littered with fragments of the grey granite\r\ncolumns which once formed the grand portico (400 by 200 feet) of the\r\nbuilding. A large mass of Corinthian cornice remains near the cella\r\nfacing the Coliseum. This was the last pagan temple which remained in\r\nuse in Rome.[65] It was only closed by Theodosius in 391, and remained\r\nentire till 625, when Pope Honorius carried off the bronze tiles of its\r\nroof to St. Peter's.\r\n\r\n    \"Ac sacram resonare viam mugitibus, ante\r\n    Delubrum Romæ; colitur nam sanguine et ipsa\r\n    More deæ, nomenque loci, ceu numen, habetur.\r\n    Atque Urbis, Venerisque pari se culmine tollunt\r\n    Templa, simul geminis adolentur thura deabus.\"\r\n\r\n    _Prudentius contr. Symm._ v. 214.\r\n\r\n     \"When about to construct his magnificent temple of Venus and Rome,\r\n     Hadrian produced a design of his own and showed it with proud\r\n     satisfaction to the architect Apollodorus. The creator of the\r\n     Trajan column remarked with a sneer that the deities, if they rose\r\n     from their seats, must thrust their heads through the ceiling. The\r\n     emperor, we are assured, could not forgive this banter; but we can\r\n     hardly take to the letter the statement that he put his critic to\r\n     death for it.\"--_Merivale_, ch. lxvi.\r\n\r\nIn front of this temple stood the bronze statue of Clœlia, mentioned\r\nby Livy and Seneca, and (till the sixth century) the bronze elephants\r\nmentioned by Cassiodorus. Nearer the Coliseum may still be seen the\r\nremains of the foundation prepared by Hadrian for the _Colossal Statue\r\nof Nero_, executed in bronze by Zenodorus. This statue was twice moved,\r\nfirst by Vespasian, in A.D. 75, that it might face the chief entrance of\r\nhis amphitheatre,[66] whose plan had been already laid out. At the same\r\ntime--though it was a striking likeness of Nero--its head was surrounded\r\nwith rays that it might represent Apollo. In its second position it is\r\ndescribed by Martial:\r\n\r\n    \"Hic ubi sidereus propius videt astra colossus\r\n      Et crescunt media pegmata celsa via,\r\n    Invidiosa feri radiabant atria regis,\r\n      Unaque jam tota stabat in urbe domus.\"\r\n\r\n    _De Spect._ ii.\r\n\r\nIt was again moved (with the aid of forty-two elephants), a few yards\r\nfurther north, by Hadrian, when he built his temple of Venus and Rome.\r\nPliny describes the colossus as 110, Dion Cassius as 100 feet high.\r\n\r\n     \"Hadrian employed an architect named Decrianus to remove the\r\n     colossus of Nero, the face of which had been altered into a Sol. He\r\n     does not seem to have accomplished the design of Apollodorus to\r\n     erect a companion statue of Luna.\"--_Merivale_, ch. lxvi.\r\n\r\nNear the Church of Sta. Francesca the Via Sacra passes under the _Arch\r\nof Titus_, which, even in its restored condition, is the most beautiful\r\nmonument of the kind remaining in Rome. Its Christian interest is\r\nunrivalled, from its having been erected by the senate to commemorate\r\nthe taking of Jerusalem, and from its bas-reliefs of the seven-branched\r\ncandlestick and other treasures of the Jewish Temple. In mediæval times\r\nit was called the Arch of the Seven Candlesticks (septem lucernarum)\r\nfrom the bas-relief of the candlestick, concerning which Gregorovius\r\nremarks, that the fantastic figures carved upon it prove that it was\r\n_not_ an exact likeness of that which came from Jerusalem. The\r\nbas-reliefs are now greatly mutilated, but they are shown in their\r\nperfect state in a drawing of Giuliano di Sangallo. On the frieze is the\r\nsacred river Jordan, as an aged man, borne on a bier. The arch, which\r\nwas in a very ruinous condition, had been engrafted in the middle ages\r\ninto a fortress tower called Turris Cartularia, and so it remained till\r\nthe present century. This tower originally formed the entrance to the\r\nvast fortress of the powerful Frangipani family, which included the\r\nColiseum and a great part of the Palatine and Cœlian hills; and here,\r\nabove the gate, Pope Urban II. dwelt in 1093, under the protection of\r\nGiovanni Frangipani. The arch was repaired by Pius VII., who replaced in\r\ntravertine the lost marble portions at the top and sides.\r\n\r\n     \"Standing beneath the arch of Titus, and amid so much ancient dust,\r\n     it is difficult to forbear the commonplaces of enthusiasm, on which\r\n     hundreds of tourists have already insisted. Over the half-worn\r\n     pavement, and beneath this arch, the Roman armies had trodden in\r\n     their outward march, to fight battles, a world's width away.\r\n     Returning victorious, with royal captives, and inestimable spoil, a\r\n     Roman triumph, that most gorgeous pageant of earthly pride, has\r\n     streamed and flaunted in hundred-fold succession over these same\r\n     flagstones, and through this yet stalwart archway. It is politic,\r\n     however, to make few allusions to such a past; nor is it wise to\r\n     suggest how Cicero's feet may have stepped on yonder stone, or how\r\n     Horace was wont to stroll near by, making his footsteps chime with\r\n     the measure of the ode that was ringing in his mind. The very\r\n     ghosts of that massive and stately epoch have so much density that\r\n     the people of to-day seem the thinner of the two, and stand more\r\n     ghost-like by the arches and columns, letting the rich sculpture be\r\n     discerned through their ill-compacted substance.\"--_Hawthorne,\r\n     Transformation._\r\n\r\n     \"We passed on to the arch of Titus. Amongst the reliefs there is\r\n     the figure of a man bearing the golden candlestick from the Temple\r\n     at Jerusalem, as one of the spoils of the triumph. Yet He who\r\n     abandoned His visible and local temple to the hands of the heathen\r\n     for the sins of His nominal worshippers, has taken to Him His great\r\n     power, and has gotten Him glory by destroying the idols of Rome as\r\n     He had done the idols of Babylon; and the golden candlestick burns\r\n     and shall burn with an everlasting light, while the enemies of His\r\n     holy name, Babylon, Rome, or the carcass of sin in every land,\r\n     which the eagles of His wrath will surely find out, perish for ever\r\n     from before Him.\"--_Arnold's Journal._\r\n\r\n     \"The Jewish trophies are sculptured in bas-relief on the inside of\r\n     the arch beneath the vaulting. Opposite to these is another\r\n     bas-relief representing Titus in the quadriga, the reins borne by\r\n     the goddess Roma. In the centre of the arch, Titus is borne to\r\n     heaven by an eagle. It may be conjectured that these ornaments to\r\n     his glory were designed after the death of Vespasian, and completed\r\n     after his own.... These witnesses to the truth of history are\r\n     scanned at this day by Christians passing to and fro between the\r\n     Coliseum and the Forum; and at this day the Jew refuses to walk\r\n     beneath them, and creeps stealthily by the side, with downcast\r\n     eyes, or countenance averted.\"--_Merivale, Romans under the\r\n     Empire_, vii. 250.\r\n\r\n     \"The restoration of the arch of Titus reflects the greatest credit\r\n     on the commission appointed by Pius VII. for the restoration of\r\n     ancient edifices. This, not only beautiful, but precious monument,\r\n     had been made the nucleus of a hideous castellated fort by the\r\n     Frangipani family. Its masonry, however, embraced and held\r\n     together, as well as crushed, the marble arch; so that on freeing\r\n     it from its rude buttresses there was fear of its collapsing, and\r\n     it had first to be well bound together by props and bracing beams,\r\n     a process in which the Roman architects are unrivalled. The simple\r\n     expedient was then adopted by the architect Stern of completing the\r\n     arch in stone; for its sides had been removed. Thus increased in\r\n     solid structure, which continued all the architectural lines, and\r\n     renewed its proportions to the mutilated centre, the arch was both\r\n     completely secured and almost restored to its pristine\r\n     elegance.\"--_Wiseman's Life of Pius VII._\r\n\r\nThe processions of the popes going to the Lateran for their solemn\r\ninstallation, used to halt beside the arch of Titus while a Jew\r\npresented a copy of the Pentateuch, with a humble oath of fealty. This\r\nhumiliating ceremony was omitted for the first time at the installation\r\nof Pius IX.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt this point it may not be inappropriate to notice two other buildings,\r\nwhich, though situated on the Palatine, are totally disconnected with\r\nthe other objects occupying that hill.\r\n\r\nA lane runs up to the right from the arch of Titus. On the left is a\r\ngateway, surmounted by a faded fresco of St. Sebastian. Here is the\r\nentrance to a wild and beautiful garden, possessing most lovely views of\r\nthe various ruins, occupying the site of the gardens of Adonis. This is\r\nthe place where St. Sebastian underwent his (so-called) martyrdom, and\r\nwill call to mind the many fine pictures, scattered over Europe, of the\r\nyouthful and beautiful saint, bound to a tree, and pierced with arrows.\r\nThe finest of these are the Domenichino, in Sta. Maria degli Angeli, and\r\nthe Sodoma at Florence. He is sometimes represented as bound to an\r\norange tree, and sometimes, as in the Guido at Bologna, to a cypress,\r\nlike those we still see on this spot. Here was an important Benedictine\r\nConvent, where Pope Boniface IV. was a monk before his election to the\r\npapacy, and where the famous abbots of Monte Casino had their Roman\r\nresidence. Here, in 1118, fifty-one cardinals took refuge, and elected\r\nGelasius II. as Pope. The only building remaining is the _Church of Sta.\r\nMaria Pallara_ or _S. Sebastiano_, containing some curious inscriptions\r\nrelating to events which have occurred here, and--in the tribune,\r\nfrescoes, of the Saviour in benediction with four saints, and below,\r\ntwo other groups representing the Virgin with saints and angels, placed,\r\nas we learn by the inscription beneath, by one Benedict--probably an\r\nabbot.\r\n\r\nFurther up the lane a \"Via Crucis\" leads to the _Church of S.\r\nBuonaventura_, \"the seraphic doctor\" (Cardinal and Bishop of Albano, ob.\r\nJuly 14, 1274), who in childhood was raised from the point of death\r\n(1221) by the prayers of St. Francis, who was so surprised when he came\r\nto life, that he involuntarily exclaimed, \"O buona ventura\"--(\"what a\r\nhappy chance\")--whence the name by which he was afterwards known.[67]\r\n\r\nThe little church contains several good modern monuments. Beneath the\r\naltar is shown the body of the Blessed Leonardo of Porto-Maurizio (ob.\r\n1751), who arranged the Via Crucis in the Coliseum, and who is much\r\nrevered by the ultra-Romanists for having prophesied the proclamation of\r\nthe dogma of the Immaculate Conception. The crucifix and the picture of\r\nthe Madonna which he carried with him in his missions, are preserved in\r\nniches on either side of the tribune, and many other relics of him are\r\nshown in his cell in the adjoining convent of Minor Franciscans. Entered\r\nthrough the convent is a lovely little garden, whence there is a grand\r\nview of the Coliseum, and where a little fountain is shaded by two tall\r\npalm trees.\r\n\r\n     \"Oswald went next to the monastery of S. Buenaventura, built on the\r\n     ruins of Nero's palace. There, where so many crimes had reigned\r\n     remorselessly, poor friars, tormented by conscientious scruples,\r\n     doom themselves to fasts and stripes for the least omission of\r\n     duty. 'Our only hope,' said one, 'is that when we die, our faults\r\n     will not have exceeded our penances.' Nevill, as he entered,\r\n     stumbled over a trap, and asked its purpose. 'It is through that we\r\n     are interred,' answered one of the youngest, already a prey to the\r\n     bad air. The natives of the south fear death so much that it is\r\n     wondrous to find there these perpetual mementoes; yet nature is\r\n     often fascinated by what she dreads, and such an intoxication fills\r\n     the soul exclusively. The antique sarcophagus of a child serves as\r\n     the fountain of this institution. The boasted palm of Rome is the\r\n     only tree of its garden.\"--_Madame de Staël, Corinne._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe arch of Titus is spoken of as being \"in summa _Via Sacra_,\" as the\r\nstreet was called which led from the southern gate of Rome to the\r\nCapitol, and by which the victorious generals passed in their triumphant\r\nprocessions to the temple of Jupiter. Between the arch of Titus and the\r\nColiseum, the ancient pavement of this famous road, composed of huge\r\npolygonal blocks of lava, has been allowed to remain. Here we may\r\nimagine Horace taking his favourite walk.\r\n\r\n    \"Ibam forte Via Sacrâ, sicut meus est mos,\r\n    Nescio quid meditans nugarum, et totus in illis.\"\r\n\r\n    _Sat._ i. 9.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been the favourite resort of the _flaneurs_ of the\r\nday:\r\n\r\n    \"Videsne, Sacram metiente te viam\r\n      Cum bis ter ulnarum togâ,\r\n    Ut ora vertat huc et huc euntium\r\n      Liberrima indignatio?\"\r\n\r\n    _Horace, Epod._ 4.\r\n\r\nThe Via Sacra was originally bordered with shops, some of which,\r\ntogether with some baths, have been unearthed on the right of the road.\r\nOvid alludes frequently to the purchases which might be made there in\r\nhis time. In this especial part of the Via was the market for fruit and\r\nhoney.[68]\r\n\r\n    \"Dum bene dives ager, dum rami pondere nutant;\r\n      Adferat in calatho rustica dona puer.\r\n    Rure suburbano poteris tibi dicere missa;\r\n      Illa vel in Sacra sint licet empta Via.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Art. Aman._ ii. 263.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hill are the remains of the bason and the brick cone\r\nof a fountain called _Meta Sudans_, where the gladiators used to wash.\r\nSeneca, who lived in this neighbourhood, complains (Epist. lvi.) of the\r\nnoise which was made by a showman who blew his trumpet close to this\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\nOn the right the Via Triumphalis leads to the Via Appia, passing under\r\nthe _Arch of Constantine_. The lower bas-reliefs upon this arch, which\r\nare crude and ill-designed, refer to the deeds of Constantine; but the\r\nupper, of fine workmanship, illustrate the life of Trajan, which has led\r\nsome to imagine that the arch was originally erected in honour of\r\nTrajan, and afterwards appropriated by Constantine. They were, however,\r\nremoved from an arch of Trajan (whose ruins existed in 1430[69]), and\r\nwere appropriated by Constantine for his own arch.\r\n\r\n     \"Constantin a enlevé à un arc de triomphe de Trajan les statues de\r\n     prisonniers daces que l'on voit au sommet du sien. Ce vol a été\r\n     puni au seizième siècle, car, dans ce qui semble un accès de folie,\r\n     Lorenzino, le bizarre assassin d'Alexandre de Médicis a décapité\r\n     toutes les statues qui surmontaient l'arche Constantin, moins une,\r\n     la seule dont la tête soit antique. Heureusement on a dans les\r\n     musées, à Rome et ailleurs, bon nombre de ces statues de captifs\r\n     barbares avec le même costume, c'est-à-dire le pantalon et le\r\n     bonnet, souvent les mains liées, dans une attitude de soumission\r\n     morne, quelque fois avec une expression de sombre fierté, car l'art\r\n     romain avait la noblesse de ne pas humilier les vaincus; il ne les\r\n     représentait point à genoux, foulés aux pieds par leurs vainqueurs;\r\n     on ne donnait pas à leurs traits étranges un aspect qu'on eût pu\r\n     rendre hideux; on les plaçait sur le sommet des arcs de triomphe,\r\n     debout, la tête baissée, l'air triste.\"\r\n\r\n    \"'Summus tristis captivus in arcu.'\"\r\n\r\n    _Ampère, Emp._ ii. 169.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arch was further plundered by Clement VIII., who carried off one of\r\nits eight Corinthian columns to finish a chapel at the Lateran. They\r\nwere formerly _all_ of giallo-antico. But it is still the most striking\r\nand beautiful of the Roman arches.\r\n\r\n     \"L'inscription gravée sur l'arc de Constantin est curieuse par le\r\n     vague de l'expression en ce qui touche aux idées religieuses, par\r\n     l'indécision calculée des termes dont se servait un sénat qui\r\n     voulait éviter de se compromettre dans un sens comme dans l'autre.\r\n     L'inscription porte que cet arc a été dédié a l'empereur parcequ'il\r\n     a délivré la république d'un tyran (on dit encore la république!)\r\n     par la grandeur de son âme et une inspiration de la Divinité,\r\n     _instinctu Divinitatis_. Il parait même que ces mots ont été\r\n     ajoutés après coup pour remplacer une formule peut-être plus\r\n     explicitement païenne. Ce monument, qui célèbre le triomphe de\r\n     Constantin, ne proclame donc pas encore nettement le triomphe du\r\n     Christianisme. Comment s'en étonner, quand sur les monnaies de cet\r\n     empereur on voit d'un côté le monogramme du Christ et l'autre\r\n     l'effigie de Rome, qui était une divinité pour les\r\n     païens?\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 355.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the _Coliseum_, originally called The Flavian\r\nAmphitheatre. This vast building was begun in A.D. 72, upon the site of\r\nthe reservoir of Nero, by the Emperor Vespasian, who built as far as the\r\nthird row of arches, the last two rows being finished by Titus after his\r\nreturn from the conquest of Jerusalem. It is said that 12,000 captive\r\nJews were employed in this work, as the Hebrews in building the Pyramids\r\nof Egypt, and that the external walls alone cost a sum equal to\r\n17,000,000 francs. It consists of four stories, the first Doric, the\r\nsecond Ionic, the third and fourth Corinthian. Its circumference is 1641\r\nfeet, its length is 287, its width 182, its height 157. The entrance for\r\nthe emperor was between two arches facing the Esquiline, where there is\r\nno cornice. Here there are remains of stucco decoration. On the opposite\r\nside was a similar entrance from the Palatine. Towards S. Gregorio has\r\nbeen discovered the subterranean passage in which the Emperor Commodus\r\nwas near being assassinated. The numerous holes visible all over the\r\nexterior of the building were made in the middle ages, to extract the\r\niron cramps, at that time of great value. The arena was surrounded by a\r\nwall sufficiently high to protect the spectators from the wild beasts,\r\nwho were introduced by subterranean passages closed by huge gates, from\r\nthe side towards the Cœlian. The _podium_ contained the places of\r\nhonour reserved for the Emperor and his family, the Senate, and the\r\nVestal virgins. The places for the other spectators who entered by\r\nopenings called _vomitoria_, were arranged in three stages (_caveæ_),\r\nseparated by a gallery (_præcinctio_). The first stage for knights and\r\ntribunes, had 24 steps, the second (for the common people) 16, the third\r\n(for the soldiery) 10. The women, by order of the emperor, sate apart\r\nfrom the men, and married and unmarried men were also divided. The whole\r\nbuilding was probably capable of containing 100,000 persons. At the top,\r\non the exterior, may be seen the remains of the consoles which sustained\r\nthe _velarium_ which was drawn over the arena to shelter the spectators\r\nfrom the sun or rain. The arena could on occasions be filled with water\r\nfor the sake of naval combats.\r\n\r\nNothing is known with certainty as to the architect of the Coliseum,\r\nthough a tradition of the Church (founded on an inscription in the crypt\r\nof S. Martino al Monte), ascribes it to Gaudentius, a Christian martyr,\r\nwho afterwards suffered on the spot.[70]\r\n\r\n     \"The name of the architect to whom the great work of the Coliseum\r\n     was entrusted has not come down to us. The ancients seem themselves\r\n     to have regarded this name as a matter of little interest; nor, in\r\n     fact, do they generally care to specify the authorship of their\r\n     most illustrious buildings. The reason is obvious. The forms of\r\n     ancient art in this department were almost wholly conventional, and\r\n     the limits of design within which they were executed gave little\r\n     room for the display of original taste and special character.... It\r\n     is only in periods of eclecticism and renaissance, when the taste\r\n     of the architect has wider scope, and may lead the eye instead of\r\n     following it, that interest attaches to his personal merit. Thus it\r\n     is that the Coliseum, the most conspicuous type of Roman\r\n     civilisation, the monument which divides the admiration of\r\n     strangers in modern Rome with St. Peter's itself, is nameless and\r\n     parentless, while every stage in the construction of the great\r\n     Christian temple, the creation of a modern revival, is appropriated\r\n     with jealous care to its special claimants.\r\n\r\n     \"The dedication of the Coliseum afforded to Titus an opportunity\r\n     for a display of magnificence hitherto unrivalled, A battle of\r\n     cranes with dwarfs representing the pigmies was a fanciful novelty,\r\n     and might afford diversion for a moment; there were combats of\r\n     gladiators, among whom women were included, though no noble matron\r\n     was allowed to mingle in the fray; and the capacity of the vast\r\n     edifice was tested by the slaughter of five thousand animals in its\r\n     circuit. The show was crowned with the immission of water into the\r\n     arena, and with a sea-fight representing the contests of the\r\n     Corinthians and Corcyreans, related by Thucydides.... When all was\r\n     over, Titus himself was seen to weep, perhaps from fatigue,\r\n     possibly from vexation and disgust; but his tears were interpreted\r\n     as a presentiment of his death, which was now impending, and it is\r\n     probable that he was already suffering from a decline of bodily\r\n     strength.... He lamented effeminately the premature decease he too\r\n     surely anticipated, and, looking wistfully at the heavens,\r\n     exclaimed that he did not deserve to die. He expired on the 13th\r\n     September, 81, not having quite completed his fortieth\r\n     year.\"--_Merivale_, ch. Ix.\r\n\r\n     \"Hadrian gave a series of entertainments in honour of his\r\n     birth-day, with the slaughter of a thousand beasts, including a\r\n     hundred lions and as many lionesses. One magical scene was the\r\n     representation of forests, when the whole arena became planted with\r\n     living trees, shrubs, and flowers; to complete which illusion the\r\n     ground was made to open, and send forth wild animals from yawning\r\n     clefts, instantly re-covered with bushes.\r\n\r\n     \"One may imagine the frantic excess to which the taste for\r\n     gladiatorial combats was carried in Rome, from the preventive law\r\n     of Augustus that gladiators should no more combat without\r\n     permission of the senate; that prætors should not give these\r\n     spectacles more than twice a year; that more than sixty couples\r\n     should not engage at the same time; and that neither knights nor\r\n     senators should ever contend in the arena. The gladiators were\r\n     classified according to the national manner of fighting which they\r\n     imitated. Thus were distinguished the Gothic, Dacian, Thracian, and\r\n     Samnite combatants; the _Retiarii_, who entangled their opponents\r\n     in nets thrown with the left hand, defending themselves with\r\n     tridents in the right; the _Secutores_, whose special skill was in\r\n     pursuit; the _Laqueatores_, who threw slings against their\r\n     adversaries; the _Dimachæ_, armed with a short sword in each hand;\r\n     the _Hoplomachi_, armed at all points; the _Myrmillones_, so called\r\n     from the figure of a fish at the crest of the Gallic helmet they\r\n     wore; the _Bustuarii_, who fought at funeral games; the\r\n     _Bestiarii_, who only assailed animals; other classes who fought on\r\n     horseback, called _Andabates_; and those combating in chariots\r\n     drawn by two horses, _Essedarii_. Gladiators were originally\r\n     slaves, or prisoners of war; but the armies who contended on the\r\n     Roman arena in later epochs, were divided into compulsory and\r\n     voluntary combatants, the former alone composed of slaves, or\r\n     condemned criminals. The latter went through a laborious education\r\n     in their art, supported at the public cost, and instructed by\r\n     masters called _Lanistæ_, resident in colleges, called _Ludi_. To\r\n     the eternal disgrace of the morals of Imperial Rome, it is recorded\r\n     that women sometimes fought in the arena, without more modesty than\r\n     hired gladiators. The exhibition of himself in this character by\r\n     Commodus, was a degradation of the imperial dignity, perhaps more\r\n     infamous, according to ancient Roman notions, than the theatrical\r\n     performances of Nero.\"--_Hemans' Story of Monuments in Rome._\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Commodus (A.D. 180-182), frequently fought in the Coliseum\r\nhimself, and killed both gladiators and wild beasts, calling himself\r\nHercules, dressed in a lion's-skin, with his hair sprinkled with\r\ngold-dust.\r\n\r\nThe gladiatorial combats came to an end, when, in A.D. 403, an oriental\r\nmonk named Telemachus, was so horrified at them, that he rushed into the\r\nmidst of the arena and besought the spectators to renounce them: instead\r\nof listening to him, they stoned him to death. The first martyrdom here\r\nwas that of St Ignatius, said to have been the child especially blessed\r\nby our Saviour--the disciple of John--and the companion of Polycarp--who\r\nwas sent here from Antioch, where he was bishop. When brought into the\r\narena, he knelt down, and exclaimed, \"Romans who are present, know that\r\nI have not been brought into this place for any crime, but in order that\r\nby this means I may merit the fruition of the glory of God, for love of\r\nwhom I have been made prisoner. I am as the grain of the field, and must\r\nbe ground by the teeth of the lions, that I may become bread fit for His\r\ntable.\" The lions were then let loose, and devoured him, except the\r\nlarger bones, which the Christians collected during the night.\r\n\r\n     \"It is related of Ignatius that he grew up in such innocence of\r\n     heart and purity of life, that to him it was granted to hear the\r\n     angels sing; hence, when he became bishop of Antioch, he introduced\r\n     into the service of his church the practice of singing the praises\r\n     of God in responses, as he had heard the choirs of angels answering\r\n     each other.... His story and fate are so well attested, and so\r\n     sublimely affecting, that it has always been to me a cause of\r\n     surprise as well as regret to find so few representations of\r\n     him.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, 693.\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Ignatius, 115 Christians were shot down here\r\nwith arrows. Under Hadrian, A.D. 218, a patrician named Placidus, his\r\nwife Theophista, and his two sons, were first exposed here to the wild\r\nbeasts, but when these refused to touch them were shut up in a brazen\r\nbull, and roasted by a fire lighted beneath. In 253, Abdon and Sennen,\r\ntwo rich citizens of Babylon, were exposed here to two lions and four\r\nbears, but on their refusing to attack them, were killed by the swords\r\nof the gladiators. In A.D. 259, Sempronius, Olympius, Theodulus, and\r\nExuperia, were burnt at the entrance of the Coliseum, before the statue\r\nof the Sun. In A.D. 272, Sta. Prisca was vainly exposed here to a lion,\r\nthen starved for three days, then stretched on a rack to have her flesh\r\ntorn by iron hooks, then put into a furnace, and--having survived all\r\nthese torments--was finally beheaded. In A.D. 277, Sta. Martina, another\r\nnoble Roman lady, was exposed in vain to the beasts and afterwards\r\nbeheaded in the Coliseum. St. Alexander under Antoninus; St. Potitus,\r\n168; St. Eleutherius, bishop of Illyria, under Hadrian; St Maximus, son\r\nof a senator, 284; and Vitus, Crescentia, and Modesta, under Domitian,\r\nwere also martyred here.[71]\r\n\r\n     \"It is no fiction, but plain, sober, honest truth, to say: so\r\n     suggestive and distinct is it at this hour: that, for a\r\n     moment--actually in passing in--they who will, may have the whole\r\n     great pile before them, as it used to be, with thousands of eager\r\n     faces staring down into the arena, and such a whirl of strife, and\r\n     blood, and dust going on there, as no language can describe. Its\r\n     solitude, its awful beauty, and its utter desolation, strike upon\r\n     the stranger, the next moment, like a softened sorrow; and never in\r\n     his life, perhaps, will he be so moved and overcome by any sight,\r\n     not immediately connected with his own affections and afflictions.\r\n\r\n     \"To see it crumbling there, an inch a year; its walls and arches\r\n     overgrown with green, its corridors open to the day; the long\r\n     grass growing in its porches; young trees of yesterday springing\r\n     up on its ragged parapets, and bearing fruit--chance produce of the\r\n     seeds dropped there by the birds who build their nests within its\r\n     chinks and crannies; to see its pit of fight filled up with earth,\r\n     and the peaceful cross planted in the centre; to climb into its\r\n     upper halls, and look down on ruin, ruin, ruin, all about it; the\r\n     triumphal arches of Constantine, Septimius Severus, and Titus, the\r\n     Roman Forum, the Palace of the Cæsars, the temples of the old\r\n     religion, fallen down and gone; is to see the ghost of old Rome,\r\n     wicked, wonderful old city, haunting the very ground on which its\r\n     people trod. It is the most impressive, the most stately, the most\r\n     solemn, grand, majestic, mournful sight conceivable. Never, in its\r\n     bloodiest prime, can the sight of the gigantic Coliseum, full and\r\n     running over with the lustiest life, have moved one heart, as it\r\n     must move all who look upon it now, a ruin. God be thanked: a ruin!\r\n\r\n     \"As it tops all other ruins: standing there, a mountain among\r\n     graves: so do its ancient influences outlive all other remnants of\r\n     the old mythology and old butchery of Rome, in the nature of the\r\n     fierce and cruel Roman people. The Italian face changes as the\r\n     visitor approaches the city; its beauty becomes devilish; and there\r\n     is scarcely one countenance in a hundred, among the common people\r\n     in the streets, that would not be at home and happy in a renovated\r\n     Coliseum to-morrow.\"--_Dickens._\r\n\r\nThe spot where the Christian martyrs suffered is now marked by a tall\r\ncross, devoutly kissed by the faithful,--and all round the arena of the\r\nColiseum, are the small chapels or \"stations,\" used in the Via Crucis,\r\nwhich is observed here at 4 P.M. every Friday, when a confraternity\r\nclothed in grey, with only the eyes visible, is followed by a crowd of\r\nworshippers who chaunt and pray at each station in turn,--after which a\r\nCapuchin monk preaches from a pulpit on the left of the arena. These\r\nsermons are often very striking, being delivered in a familiar style,\r\nand upon popular subjects of the day, but they also often border on the\r\nburlesque.\r\n\r\n     \"Oswald voulut aller au Colisée pour entendre le Capucin qui devait\r\n     y prêcher en plein air au pied de l'un des autels qui désignent,\r\n     dans l'intérieur de l'enceinte, ce qu'on appelle _la route de la\r\n     Croix_. Quel plus beau sujet pour l'éloquence que l'aspect de ce\r\n     monument, que cette arène où les martyrs ont succédé aux\r\n     gladiateurs! Mais il ne faut rien espérer à cet égard du pauvre\r\n     Capucin, qui ne connâit de l'histoire des hommes que sa propre vie.\r\n     Néanmoins, si l'on parvient à ne pas écouter son mauvais sermon, on\r\n     se sent ému par les divers objets dont il est entouré. La plupart\r\n     de ses auditeurs sont de la confrérie des Camaldules; ils se\r\n     revêtent, pendant les exercises religieux, d'une espèce de robe\r\n     grise qui couvre entièrement la tête et le corps, et ne laisse que\r\n     deux petites ouvertures pour les yeux; c'est ainsi que les ombres\r\n     pourraient être représentées. Ces hommes, ainsi cachés sous leurs\r\n     vêtements, se prosternent la face contre terre, et se frappent la\r\n     poitrine. Quand le prédicateur se jette à genoux en criant\r\n     _miséricorde de pitié!_ le peuple qui l'environne se jette aussi à\r\n     genoux, et répète ce même cri, qui va se perdre sous les vieux\r\n     portiques du Colisée. Il est impossible de ne pas éprouver alors\r\n     une émotion profondément religieuse; cet appel de la douleur à la\r\n     bonté, de la terre au ciel, remue l'âme jusque dans son sanctuaire\r\n     le plus intime.\"--_Madame de Staël._\r\n\r\n     \"'C'est aujourd'hui Vendredi,' dit Guy, 'il y aura foule au\r\n     Colisée, il vaudrait mieux, je crois, y aller un autre jour.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Non, non,' dit Eveline, 'c'est précisément pour cela que je veux\r\n     y aller.

It was a delicious evening, and everything\r\n     was looking to advantage:--the huge Coliseum just under me, the\r\n     tufts of ilex and aliternus and other shrubs that fringe the walls\r\n     everywhere in the lower part, while the outside wall, with its top\r\n     of gigantic stones, lifts itself high above, and seems like a\r\n     mountain barrier of bare rock, enclosing a green and varied valley.\r\n     I sat and gazed upon the scene with an intense and mingled feeling.\r\n     The world could show nothing grander; it was one which for years I\r\n     had longed to see, and I was now looking at it for the last time.\r\n     When I last see the dome of St. Peter's I shall seem to be parting\r\n     from more than a mere town full of curiosities, where the eye has\r\n     been amused, and the intellect gratified. I never thought to have\r\n     felt thus tenderly towards Rome; but the inexplicable solemnity and\r\n     beauty of her ruined condition has quite bewitched me, and to the\r\n     latest hour of my life I shall remember the Forum, the surrounding\r\n     hills, and the magnificent Coliseum.\"--_Arnold's Letters._\r\n\r\nThe upper arches frame a series of views of the Aventine, the\r\nCapitoline, the Cœlian, and the Campagna, like a succession of\r\nbeautiful pictures.\r\n\r\nThose who visit the Coliseum by moonlight will realize the truthfulness\r\nof the following descriptions:--\r\n\r\n    \"I do remember me, that in my youth,\r\n    When I was wandering,--upon such a night,\r\n    I stood within the Coliseum's wall,\r\n    Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome;\r\n    The trees which grew along the broken arches\r\n    Waved dark in the blue midnight, and the stars\r\n    Shone through the rents of ruin; from afar\r\n    The watch-dog bayed beyond the Tiber; and\r\n    More near from out the Cæsar's palace came\r\n    The owl's long cry, and, interruptedly,\r\n    Of distant sentinels the fitful song\r\n    Began and died upon the gentle wind:--\r\n    Some cypresses beyond the time-worn breach\r\n    Appeared to skirt the horizon, yet they stood\r\n    Within a bowshot where the Cæsars dwelt,\r\n    And dwell the tuneless birds of night, amidst\r\n    A grove which springs through levell'd battlements,\r\n    And twines its roots with the imperial hearths;\r\n    Ivy usurps the laurel's place of growth;--\r\n    But the gladiator's bloody circus stands,\r\n    A noble wreck in ruinous perfection!\r\n    While Cæsar's chambers, and the Augustan halls,\r\n    Grovel on earth in indistinct decay.\r\n    And thou didst shine, thou rolling moon, upon\r\n    All this, and cast a wide and tender light,\r\n    Which softened down the hoar austerity\r\n    Of rugged desolation, and fill'd up,\r\n    As 't were anew, the gaps of centuries;\r\n    Leaving that beautiful which still was so,\r\n    And making that which was not, till the place\r\n    Became religion, and the heart ran o'er\r\n    With silent worship of the great of old:--\r\n    The dead but scepter'd sovereigns, who still rule\r\n    Our spirits from their urns.\"\r\n\r\n    _Manfred._\r\n\r\n    \"Arches on arches! as it were that Rome,\r\n    Collecting the chief trophies of her line,\r\n    Would build up all her triumphs in one dome,\r\n    Her Coliseum stands; the moonbeams shine\r\n    As 't were its natural torches, for divine\r\n    Should be the light which streams here, to illume\r\n    The long-explored but still exhaustless mine\r\n    Of contemplation; and the azure gloom\r\n    Of an Italian night, where the deep skies assume\r\n\r\n    \"Hues which have words, and speak to ye of heaven,\r\n    Floats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,\r\n    And shadows forth its glory.

Three days ago (Feb. 2, 1787) we made good use of a light\r\n     and most beautiful night. The Coliseum presents a vision of beauty.\r\n     It is closed at night; a hermit lives inside in a little church,\r\n     and beggars roost amid the ruined vaults. They had lighted a fire\r\n     on the bare ground, and a gentle breeze drove the smoke across the\r\n     arena. The lower portion of the ruin was lost, while the enormous\r\n     walls above stood forth into the darkness. We stood at the gates\r\n     and gazed upon this phenomenon. The moon shone high and bright.\r\n     Gradually the smoke moved through the chinks and apertures in the\r\n     walls, and the moon illuminated it like a mist. It was an exquisite\r\n     moment!\"--_Goethe._\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the building of the Coliseum remained entire until\r\nthe eighth century, and that its ruin dates from the invasion of Robert\r\nGuiscard, who destroyed it to prevent its being used as a stronghold by\r\nthe Romans. During the middle ages it served as a fortress, and became\r\nthe castle of the great family of Frangipani, who here gave refuge to\r\nPope Innocent II. (Papareschi) and his family, against the anti-pope\r\nAnacletus II., and afterwards in the same way protected Innocent III.\r\n(Conti) and his brothers against the anti-pope Paschal II. Constantly at\r\nwar with the Frangipani were the Annibaldi, who possessed a neighbouring\r\nfortress, and obtained from Gregory IX. a grant of half the Coliseum,\r\nwhich was rescinded by Innocent IV. During the absence of the popes at\r\nAvignon the Annibaldi got possession of the whole of the Coliseum, but\r\nit was taken away again in 1312, and placed in the hands of the\r\nmunicipality, after which it was used for bull-fights, in which (as\r\ndescribed by Monaldeschi) nobles of high rank took part and lost their\r\nlives. In 1381 the senate made over part of the ruins to the Canons of\r\nthe Lateran, to be used as a hospital, and their occupation is still\r\ncommemorated by the arms of the Chapter (our Saviour's head between two\r\ncandelabra) sculptured in various parts of the building. From the\r\nfourteenth century it began to be looked upon as a stone-quarry, and the\r\nPalazzos Farnese, Barberini, S. Marco, and the Cancellaria, were built\r\nwith materials plundered from its walls. It is said that the first of\r\nthese destroyers, Cardinal Farnese, only extorted permission from his\r\nreluctant uncle, Paul III., to quarry as much stone as he could remove\r\nin twelve hours, and that he availed himself of this permission to let\r\nloose four thousand workmen upon the building. Sixtus V. endeavoured to\r\nutilize it by turning the arcades into shops, and establishing a woollen\r\nmanufactory, and Clement XI. (1700--1721) by a manufactory of saltpetre,\r\nbut both happily failed. In the last century the tide of restoration\r\nbegan to set in. A Carmelite monk, Angelo Paoli, represented the\r\niniquity of allowing a spot consecrated by such holy memories to be\r\ndesecrated, and Clement XI. consecrated the arena to the memory of the\r\nmartyrs who had suffered there, and erected in one of the archways the\r\nstill existing chapel of Sta. Maria della Pietà. The hermit appointed to\r\ntake care of this chapel was stabbed in 1742, which caused Benedict XIV.\r\nto shut in the Coliseum with bars and gates. After this time destruction\r\nbecame sacrilege, and the five last popes all contributed to strengthen\r\nand preserve the walls which remain. Even so late as thirty years ago,\r\nhowever, the interior was (like that of an English abbey) an uneven\r\ngrassy space littered with masses of ruin, amid which large trees grew\r\nand flourished, and the clearing out of the arena, though exhibiting\r\nmore perfectly the ancient form of the building, is much to be regretted\r\nby lovers of the picturesque.[72]\r\n\r\nAmong the ecclesiastical legends connected with the Coliseum, it is said\r\nthat Gregory the Great presented some foreign ambassadors with a handful\r\nof earth from the arena as a relic for their sovereigns, and upon their\r\nreceiving the gift with disrespect, he pressed it, when blood flowed\r\nfrom the soil. Pius V, urged those who wished for relics to gather up\r\nthe dust of the Coliseum, wet with the blood of the martyrs.\r\n\r\nIn 1744 \"the blessed Leonardo di Porto Maurizio,\" who is buried in S.\r\nBuonaventura, drew immense crowds to the Coliseum by his preaching, and\r\nobtained permission from Benedict XIV. to found the confraternity of\r\n\"Amanti di Gesù e Maria,\" for whom the Via Crucis was established here.\r\nRecently the ruins have been associated with the holy beggar, Benoit\r\nJoseph Labré (beatified by Pius IX. in 1860), who died at Rome in 1783,\r\nafter a life spent in devotion. He was accustomed to beg in the\r\nColiseum, to sleep at night under its arcades, and to pray for hours at\r\nits various shrines.\r\n\r\nThe name Coliseum is first found in the writings of the Venerable Bede,\r\nwho quotes a prophecy of Anglo-Saxon pilgrims.\r\n\r\n    \"While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;\r\n    When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;\r\n    And when Rome falls, the world.\"[73]\r\n\r\nThe name was probably derived from its size; the amphitheatre of Capua\r\nwas also called Colossus.\r\n\r\n     \"When one looks at the Coliseum everything else becomes small; it\r\n     is so great that one cannot keep its true image in one's soul; one\r\n     only remembers it on a smaller scale, and returning thither again\r\n     finds it again grown larger.\"--_Goethe, Romische Briefe._\r\n\r\nOnce or twice in the course of every Roman winter the Coliseum is\r\nilluminated with Bengal lights.\r\n\r\n     \"Les étrangers se donnent parfois l'amusement d'éclairer le Colisée\r\n     avec des feux de Bengale. Cela ressemble un peu trop à un finale de\r\n     mélodrame, et on peut préférer comme illumination un radieux soleil\r\n     on les douces lueurs de la lune. Cependant j'avoue que la première\r\n     fois que le Colisée m'apparut ainsi, embrasé de feux rougeâtres,\r\n     son histoire me revint vivement à la pensée. Je trouvais qu'il\r\n     avait en ce moment sa vraie couleur, la couleur du sang.\"--_Ampère,\r\n     Emp._ ii. 156.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE VELABRUM AND THE GHETTO.\r\n\r\n     S.

During the empire, this\r\nstreet, leading from the Forum to the Circus Maximus, was one of the\r\nmost important. Martial speaks of its silk-mercers; from an inscription\r\non a tomb we know that the fashionable tailors were to be found there;\r\nand the perfumers' shops were of such abundance as to give to part of\r\nthe street the name of Vicus Thurarius. At its entrance was the statue\r\nof the Etruscan god, Vertumnus, the patron of the quarter.[74] This was\r\nthe street by which the processions of the Circensian games passed from\r\nthe Forum to the Circus Maximus. In one of the Verrine Orations, an\r\naccusation brought by Cicero against the patrician Verres, was that from\r\navaricious motives he had paved even this street--used for processions\r\nof the Circus--in such a manner that he would not venture to use it\r\nhimself.[75]\r\n\r\nAll this valley was once a stagnant marsh, left by inundations of the\r\nTiber, for in early times the river often overflowed the whole valley\r\nbetween the Palatine and the Capitoline hills, and even reached as far\r\nas the foot of the Quirinal, where the Goat's Pool, at which Romulus\r\ndisappeared, is supposed to have formed part of the same swamp. Ovid, in\r\ndescribing the processions of the games, speaks of the willows and\r\nrushes which once covered this ground, and the marshy places which one\r\ncould not pass over except with bare feet:\r\n\r\n    \"Qua Velabra solent in Circum ducere pompas,\r\n      Nil præter salices crassaque canna fuit,\r\n    Sæpe suburbanas rediens conviva per undas\r\n      Cantat, et ad nautas ebria verba jacit.\r\n    Nondum conveniens diversis iste figuris\r\n      Nomen ab averso ceperat amne deus.\r\n    Hic quoque lucus erat juncis et arundine densus,\r\n      Et pede velato non adeunda palus.\r\n    Stagna recesserunt, et aquas sua ripa coërcet:\r\n      Siccaque nunc tellus. Mos tamen ille manet.\"\r\n\r\n    _Fast._ vi. 405.\r\n\r\nWe even know the price which was paid for being ferried across the\r\nVelabrum: \"it was a _quadrans_, three times as much as one pays now for\r\nthe boat at the Ripetta.\"[76] The creation of the Cloaca Maxima had\r\nprobably done much towards draining, but some fragments of the marsh\r\nremained to a late period.\r\n\r\nAccording to Varro the name of the Velabrum was derived from _vehere_,\r\nbecause of the boats which were employed to convey passengers from one\r\nhill to the other.[77] Others derive the name from _vela_, also in\r\nreference to the mode of transit, or, according to another idea, in\r\nreference to the awnings which were stretched across the street to\r\nshelter the processions,--though the name was in existence long before\r\nany processions were thought of.\r\n\r\nIt was the waters of the Velabrum which bore the cradle of Romulus and\r\nRemus from the Tiber, and deposited it under the famous fig-tree of the\r\nPalatine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the left of the Via dei Fienili (shut in by a railing, generally\r\nclosed, but which will be opened on appealing to the sacristan next\r\ndoor) is the round _Church of S. Teodoro_. The origin of this building\r\nis unknown. It used to be called the temple of Romulus, on the very\r\nslight foundation that the famous bronze wolf, mentioned by Dionysius as\r\nexisting in the temple of Romulus, was found near this spot. Dyer\r\nsupposes that it may have been the Temple of Cybele; this, however, was\r\nupon, and not under, the Palatine. Be they what they may, the remains\r\nwere dedicated as a Christian church by Adrian I., in the eighth\r\ncentury, and some well preserved mosaics in the tribune are of that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n     \"It is curious to note in Rome how many a modern superstition has\r\n     its root in an ancient one, and how tenaciously customs still cling\r\n     to the old localities. On the Capitoline hill the bronze she-wolf\r\n     was once worshipped as the wooden Bambino is now. It stood in the\r\n     Temple of Romulus, and there the ancient Romans used to carry\r\n     children to be cured of their diseases by touching it. On the\r\n     supposed site of the temple now stands the church dedicated to S.\r\n     Teodoro, or Santo Toto, as he is called in Rome. Though names must\r\n     have changed and the temple has vanished, and church after church\r\n     has here decayed and been rebuilt, the old superstition remains,\r\n     and the common people at certain periods still bring their sick\r\n     children to Santo Toto, that he may heal them with his\r\n     touch.\"--_Story's Roba di Roma._[78]\r\n\r\nFurther on the left, still under the shadow of the Palatine Hill, is the\r\nlarge _Church of Sta. Anastasia_, containing, beneath the altar, a\r\nbeautiful statue of the martyred saint reclining on a faggot.\r\n\r\n     \"Notwithstanding her beautiful Greek name, and her fame as one of\r\n     the great saints of the Greek Calendar, Sta. Anastasia is\r\n     represented as a noble Roman lady, who perished during the\r\n     persecution of Diocletian. She was persecuted by her husband and\r\n     family for openly professing the Christian faith, but being\r\n     sustained by the eloquent exhortations of St. Chrysogonus, she\r\n     passed triumphantly, receiving in due time the crown of martyrdom,\r\n     being condemned to the flames. Chrysogonus was put to death with\r\n     the sword and his body thrown into the sea.\r\n\r\n     \"According to the best authorities, these two saints did not suffer\r\n     in Rome, but in Illyria; yet in Rome we are assured that Anastasia,\r\n     after her martyrdom, was buried by her friend Apollina in the\r\n     garden of her house under the Palatine hill and close to the Circus\r\n     Maximus. There stood the church, dedicated in the fourth century,\r\n     and there it now stands. It was one of the principal churches in\r\n     Rome in the time of St. Jerome, who, according to ancient\r\n     tradition, celebrated mass at one of the altars, which is still\r\n     regarded with peculiar veneration.\"--_Mrs. Jameson's Sacred and\r\n     Legendary Art._\r\n\r\nIt was the custom for the mediæval popes to celebrate their second mass\r\nof Christmas night in this church, for which reason Sta. Anastasia is\r\nstill especially commemorated in that mass.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the high altar is the tomb of the learned Cardinal Mai,\r\nby the sculptor Benzoni, who owed everything to the kind interest with\r\nwhich this cardinal regarded him from childhood. The epitaph is\r\nremarkable. It is thus translated by Cardinal Wiseman:\r\n\r\n    \"I, who my life in wakeful studies wore,\r\n      Bergamo's son, named Angelo, here lie.\r\n    The empyreal robe and crimson hat I bore,\r\n      Rome gave. Thou giv'st me, Christ, th' empyreal sky.\r\n    Awaiting Thee, long toil I could endure:\r\n    So with Thee be my rest now, sweet, secure.\"\r\n\r\nThrough this church, also, we may enter some of the subterraneous\r\nchambers of the Palace of the Cæsars.\r\n\r\nThe valley near this, between the Palatine and the Aventine, was the\r\nsite of the _Circus Maximus_, of which the last vestiges were destroyed\r\nin the time of Paul V. Its ground plan can, however, be identified, with\r\nthe assistance of the small circus of Maxentius on the Via Appia, which\r\nstill partially exists. It was intended for chariot-races and\r\nhorse-races, and is said to have been first instituted by Tarquinius\r\nPriscus after his conquest of the Latin town of Apiolæ. It was a vast\r\noblong, ending in a semicircle, and surrounded by three rows of seats,\r\ntermed collectively _cavea_. In the centre of the area was the low wall\r\ncalled the _spina_, at each end of which were the _metæ_, or goals.\r\nBetween the metæ were columns supporting the _ova_, egg-shaped balls,\r\nand _Delphinæ_, or dolphins, each seven in number, one of which was put\r\nup for each circuit made in the race. At the extremity of the Circus\r\nwere the stalls for the horses and chariots called _Carceres_. This, the\r\nsquare end of the Circus, was termed _oppidum_, from its external\r\nresemblance to a town, with walls and towers. In the Circus Maximus,\r\nwhich was used for hunting wild beasts, Julius Cæsar made a canal,\r\ncalled _Euripus_,[79] ten feet wide, between the seats and the\r\nracecourse, to protect the spectators. The _Ludi Circenses_ were first\r\nestablished by Romulus, to attract his Sabine neighbours, in order that\r\nhe might supply his city with wives. The games were generally at the\r\nexpense of the ædiles, and their cost was so great, that Cæsar was\r\nobliged to sell his Tiburtine villa, to defray those given during his\r\nædileship. Perhaps the most magnificent games known were those in the\r\nreign of Carinus (Imp. A.D. 283), when the Circus was transformed into\r\nan artificial forest, in which hundreds of wild beasts and birds were\r\nslaughtered. At one time this Circus was capable of containing 385,000\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nAt the western extremity of the Circus Maximus stood the Temple of\r\nCeres, Liber, and Libera (said to have been vowed by the Dictator Albus\r\nPostumius, at the battle of the Lake Regillus), dedicated by the Consul\r\nSp. Cassius, B.C. 492.\r\n\r\n     \"Quand le père de Cassius l'eut immolé de ses propres mains à\r\n     l'avidité patricienne, il fit don du pécule de son fils--un fils\r\n     n'avait que son pécule comme un esclave--à ce même temple de Cérès\r\n     que Spurius Cassius avait consacré, et par une féroce ironie, mit\r\n     au bas de la statue faite avec cet argent, et qu'il dédiait à la\r\n     déesse: 'Don de la famille Cassia.'\r\n\r\n     \"L'ironie était d'autant plus amère, que l'on vendait auprès du\r\n     temple de Cérès ceux qui avaient offensé au tribun.\r\n\r\n     \"Ce temple, mis particulièrement sous la surveillance des édiles et\r\n     où ils avaient leurs archives, était le temple de la démocratie\r\n     romaine. Le farouche patricien le choisit pour lui faire adresser\r\n     par son fils mort au service de la démocratie un dérisoire\r\n     hommage.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ ii. 416.\r\n\r\nWe must now retrace our steps for a short distance, and descend into a\r\nhollow on the left, which we have passed, between the churches of S.\r\nTeodoro and Sta. Anastasia.\r\n\r\nHere an interesting group of buildings still stands to mark the site of\r\nthe famous ox-market, _Forum Boarium_. In its centre a brazen bull,\r\nbrought from Egina,[80] once commemorated the story of the oxen of\r\nGeryon, which Hercules left to pasture on this marshy site, and which\r\nwere stolen hence by Cacus,--and is said by Ovid to have given a name to\r\nthe locality:\r\n\r\n    \"Pontibus et magno juncta est celeberrima Circo\r\n    Area, quæ posito de bove nomen habet.\"\r\n\r\n    _Fast._ vi. 478.\r\n\r\nThe fact of this place being used as a market for oxen is mentioned by\r\nLivy.[81]\r\n\r\nThe Forum Boarium is associated with several deeds of cruelty. After the\r\nbattle of Cannæ, a male and female Greek and a male and female Gaul were\r\nburied alive here;[82] and here the first fight of gladiators took\r\nplace, being introduced by M. and D. Brutus, at the funeral of their\r\nfather in B.C. 264.[83] Here the Vestal virgins buried the sacred\r\nutensils of their worship, at the spot called Doliola, when they fled\r\nfrom Rome after the battle of the Allia.[84]\r\n\r\nAmongst the buildings which once existed in the Forum Boarium, but of\r\nwhich no trace remains, were the Temple of the Sabine deity Matuta, and\r\nthe Temple of Fortune, both ascribed to Servius Tullius.\r\n\r\n    \"Hac ibi luce ferunt Matutæ sacra parenti,\r\n    Sceptiferas Servi templa dedisse manus.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ vi. 479.\r\n\r\n    \"Lux eadem, Fortuna, tua est, auctorque, locusque,\r\n    Sed superinjectis quis latet æde togis?\r\n    Servius est: hoc constat enim----\"\r\n\r\n    _Fast._ vi. 569.\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Fortune was rebuilt by Lucullus, and Dion Cassius mentions\r\nthat the axle of Julius Cæsar's car broke down in front of it on\r\noccasion of one of his triumphs.[85] Another temple in this\r\nneighbourhood was that of Pudicitia Patricia, into which the noble\r\nladies refused to admit Virginia, because she had espoused a plebeian\r\nconsul[86] (see Chap. X.). Here, also, was the Temple of Hercules\r\nVictor, erected by Pompey.[87] The two earliest triumphal arches were\r\nbuilt in this forum, being in honour of L. Stertinius, erected B.C. 196,\r\nafter his victories in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe building which first attracts attention, among those now standing,\r\nis the _Arch of Janus_, the Sabine god. It has four equal sides and\r\narches, turned to the four points of the compass, and forty-eight\r\nniches, probably intended for the reception of small statues.\r\nBas-reliefs on the inverted blocks employed in the lower part of this\r\nedifice, show that they must have been removed from earlier buildings.\r\nThis was probably used as a portico for shelter or business for those\r\nwho trafficked in the Forum; there were many similar porticoes in\r\nancient Rome.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the arch of Janus is a narrow alley, spanned by low brick\r\narches, which leads first to the beautiful clear spring of the Aqua\r\nArgentina, which, according to some authorities, is the place where\r\nCastor and Pollux watered their horses after the battle of the Lake\r\nRegillus.\r\n\r\n    \"Then on rode those strange horsemen,\r\n      With slow and lordly pace;\r\n    And none who saw their bearing\r\n      Durst ask their name or race.\r\n    On rode they to the Forum,\r\n      While laurel boughs and flowers\r\n    From house-tops and from windows,\r\n      Fell on their crests in showers.\r\n\r\n    \"When they drew nigh to Vesta,\r\n      They vaulted down amain,\r\n    And washed their horses in the well\r\n      That springs by Vesta's fane.\r\n    And straight again they mounted\r\n      And rode to Vesta's door;\r\n    Then, like a blast, away they passed,\r\n      And no man saw them more.\"\r\n\r\n    _Macaulay's Lays._\r\n\r\nThe alley is closed by an arch of the celebrated _Cloaca Maxima_, the\r\nfamous drain formed by Tarquinius Priscus, fifth king of Rome, to dry\r\nthe marshy land of the Velabrum.\r\n\r\n     \"Infima urbis loca circa Forum, aliasque interjectas collibus\r\n     convalles, quia ex planis locis haud facile evehebant aquas,\r\n     cloacis a fastigio in Tiberim ductis siccat.\"--_Livy_, lib. i. c.\r\n     38.\r\n\r\nThe Cloaca extended from the Forum to the Tiber, and is still, after\r\n2,400 years, used, during the latter part of its course, for the purpose\r\nfor which it was originally intended, though Pliny was filled with\r\nwonder that, in his time, it had already withstood the earthquakes,\r\ninundations, and accidents of seven hundred years. Strabo tells that the\r\ntunnel of the Cloaca was of sufficient height to admit a waggon laden\r\nwith hay, but this probably supposes the water at its lowest. Agrippa,\r\nwho cleaned out the Cloaca, navigated its whole length in a boat. The\r\nmouth of the Cloaca, composed of three concentric courses of blocks of\r\npeperino, without cement, is visible on the river a little to the right\r\nof the temple of Vesta.\r\n\r\n     \"Ces lieux ont encore un air et comme une odeur de marécage--quand\r\n     on rôde aux approches de la nuit dans ce coin désert de Rome où fut\r\n     placée la scène des premiers moments de son premier roi, on y\r\n     retrouve, à présent mieux qu'au temps de Tite-Live, quelque chose\r\n     de l'impression que ce lieu devait produire il y a vingt-cinq\r\n     siècles, à l'époque où, selon la vieille tradition, le berceau de\r\n     Romulus s'arrêta dans les boues du Vélabre, au pied du Palatin,\r\n     près de l'antre Lupercal. Il faut s'écarter un peu de cet endroit,\r\n     qui était au pied du versant occidental du Palatin, et faire\r\n     quelques pas à droite pour aller chercher les traces du Vélabre là\r\n     où les rues et les habitations modernes ne les ont pas entièrement\r\n     effacées. En s'avançant vers la Cloaca Maxima, on rencontre un\r\n     enfoncement où une vieille église, elle-même au dedans humide et\r\n     moisie, rappelle par son nom, San Giorgio in Velabro, que le\r\n     Vélabre a été là. On voit sourdre encore les eaux qui\r\n     l'alimentaient sous une voûte sombre et froide, tapissée de\r\n     mousses, de scolopendres et de grandes herbes frissonnant dans la\r\n     nuit. Alentour, tout a un aspect triste et abandonné, abandonné\r\n     comme le furent au bord du marais, suivant l'antique récit, les\r\n     enfants dont on croit presque ouïr dans le crépuscule les\r\n     vagissements. L'imagination n'a pas de peine à se représenter les\r\n     arbres et les plantes aquatiques qui croissaient sur le bord de cet\r\n     enfoncement que voilà, et à travers lesquelles la louve de la\r\n     légende se glissait à cette heure pour venir boire à cette eau. Ces\r\n     lieux sont assez peu fréquentés et assez silencieux pour qu'on se\r\n     les figure comme ils étaient alors, alors qu'il n'y avait ici,\r\n     comme dit Tite-Live, vrai cette fois, que des solitudes désertes:\r\n     _Vastæ tunc solitudines erant_.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ i. 271.\r\n\r\nThe church with the picturesque campanile near the arch of Janus, is _S.\r\nGiorgio in Velabro_, founded in the fourth century, as the Basilica\r\nSempronia, but repeatedly rebuilt. The architrave above its portico was\r\nthat where Rienzi affixed his famous inscription, announcing the return\r\nto the Good Estate: \"_In breve tempo gli Romani torneranno al loro\r\nantico buono stato_.\" The church is seldom open, except on its festival\r\n(Jan. 20), and during its station in Lent. The interior is in the\r\nbasilica form, the long nave being lined by sixteen columns, of various\r\nsizes, and with strangely different capitals, showing that they have\r\nbeen plundered from ancient temples. The carving on some of the capitals\r\nis sharp and delicate. There is a rather handsome ancient baldacchino,\r\nwith an old Greek picture let into its front, over the high altar.\r\nBeneath is preserved a fragment of the banner of St George. Some injured\r\nfrescoes in the tribune replace mosaics which once existed here, and\r\nwhich were attributed to Giotto. In the centre is the Saviour, between\r\nthe Virgin and St. Peter; on one side, St. George with the martyr's palm\r\nand the warrior's banner,--on the other, St. Sebastian, with an arrow.\r\nSeveral fragments of carving and inscriptions are built into the side\r\nwalls. The pictures are poor and ugly which relate to the saint of the\r\nchurch, St. George (the patron of England and Germany), the knight of\r\nCappadocia, who delivered the Princess Cleodolinda from the dragon.\r\n\r\n     \"Among good specimens of thirteenth century architecture is the\r\n     portico of S. Giorgio, with Ionic columns and horizontal\r\n     architrave, on which is a gothic inscription, in quaint Leonine\r\n     verse, informing us that the Cardinal (or Prior) Stephen, added\r\n     this detail (probably the campanile also), to the ancient\r\n     church--about the middle of the thirteenth century, as is supposed,\r\n     though no date is given here; and in the midst of an age so alien\r\n     to classic influences, a work in which classic feeling thus\r\n     predominates, is remarkable.\"--_Heman's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\nPartly hidden by the portico of this church, is the beautiful miniature\r\n_Arch of Septimius Severus_, erected to the emperor, his wife Julia Pia,\r\nand his sons Caracalla and Geta, by the silversmiths (argentarii) who\r\nhad their shops in the Forum Boarium on this very spot (\"cujus loci qui\r\ninvehent\"). The part of the dedication relating to Geta (as in the\r\nlarger arch of Septimius) was obliterated after his murder, and the\r\nwords FORTISSIMO FELICISSIMOQUE PRINCIPI engraved in its place. The\r\narchitecture and sculpture, part of which represents a sacrifice by the\r\nimperial family, prove the decadence of art at this period.\r\n\r\nProceeding in a direct line from the Arch of Janus, we reach the _Church\r\nof Sta. Maria in Cosmedin_, on the site of a Temple of Ceres, dedicated\r\nby the consul Spurius Cassius, B.C. 493, and afterwards re-dedicated to\r\nCeres and Proserpine, probably by Augustus, who had been initiated into\r\nthe Eleusinian mysteries in Greece. The church was built in the basilica\r\nform, in 782, by Adrian I., when the name Cosmedin, from the Greek\r\nκοσμος, is supposed to have been given, from the ornaments with which he\r\nadorned it It was intended for the use of the Greek exiles expelled from\r\nthe East by the iconoclasts under Constantine Copronimus, and derived\r\nthe epithet of Sta. Maria in Scuola Greca, from a \"Schola\" attached to\r\nit for their benefit. Another relic of the Greek colony which existed\r\nhere is to be found in the name of the adjoining street, Via della\r\nGreca. In the middle ages the whole bank of the river near this was\r\ncalled Ripa Greca.\r\n\r\nThe interior of this church is of great interest. The nave is divided\r\nfrom the aisles by twelve ancient marble columns, of which two have\r\nespecially curious antique capitals, and are evidently remains of the\r\ntemple which once existed here. The choir is raised, as at S. Clemente.\r\nThe pavement is of splendid Opus Alexandrinum (1120); the ambones are\r\nperfect; there is a curious crypt; the altar covers an ancient bason of\r\nred granite, and is shaded by a gothic canopy, supported by four\r\nEgyptian granite pillars; behind it is a fine episcopal throne, with\r\nlions, said to have been used by St. Augustine, an ancient Greek picture\r\nof the Virgin, and a graceful tabernacle of marble inlaid with mosaic,\r\nby _Deodato Cosmati_. In the sacristy is a very curious mosaic, one of\r\nthe few relics preserved from the old St Peter's, A.D. 705. (There is\r\nanother in S. Marco at Florence.) Crescimbeni, the founder and historian\r\nof the Arcadian Academy (d. 1728), is buried in this church, of which he\r\nwas a canon. On St. Valentine's Day the skull of St. Valentine, crowned\r\nwith roses, is exhibited here.\r\n\r\nIn the portico is the strange and huge mask of stone, which gives the\r\nname of _Bocca della Verita_ to the neighbouring piazza. It was believed\r\nthat if a witness, whose truthfulness was doubtful, were desired to\r\nplace his hand in the mouth of this mask, he would be unable to withdraw\r\nit, if he were guilty of perjury.\r\n\r\n     \"Cette Bouche-de-Vérité est une curieuse relique du moyen âge. Elle\r\n     servait aux jugements de Dieu. Figurez-vous une meule de moulin qui\r\n     ressemble, non pas à un visage humain, mais au visage de la lune:\r\n     on y distingue des yeux, un nez et une bouche ouverte où l'accusé\r\n     mettait la main pour prêter serment. Cette bouche mordait les\r\n     menteurs; au moins la tradition l'assure. J'y ai introduit ma\r\n     dextre en disant que le Ghetto était un lieu de délices, et je n'ai\r\n     pas été mordu.\"--_About, Rome Contemporaine._\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the portico is the tomb of Cardinal Alfanus, ob.\r\n1150.\r\n\r\n     \"The church was rebuilt under Calixtus II.; about A.D. 1128, by\r\n     Alfanus, Roman Chancellor, whose marble sepulchre stands in the\r\n     atrium, with his epitaph, along a cornice, giving him that most\r\n     comprehensive title, 'an honest man,' _vir probus_. Some more than\r\n     half-faded paintings, a Madonna and Child, angels, and two mitred\r\n     heads, on the wall behind the canopy, give importance to this\r\n     Chancellor's tomb. Though now disfigured exteriorly by a modern\r\n     façade in the worst style, interiorly by a waggon-vault roof and\r\n     heavy pilasters, this church is still one of the mediæval gems of\r\n     Rome, and retains many olden details: the classic colonnades,\r\n     probably left in their original place since the time of Adrian I.;\r\n     and the fine campanile, one of the loftiest in Rome; also the\r\n     sculptured doorway, the rich intarsio pavement, the high altar, the\r\n     marble and mosaic-inlaid ambones, the marble episcopal throne, with\r\n     supporting lions and a mosaic decoration above, &c.,--all of the\r\n     twelfth century. But we have to regret the destruction of the\r\n     ancient choir-screens, and (still more inexcusable) the\r\n     white-washing of wall surfaces so as entirely to conceal the\r\n     mediæval paintings which adorned them, conformably to that once\r\n     almost universal practice of polychrome decoration in churches,\r\n     prescribed even by law under Charlemagne. Ciampini (see his\r\n     valuable history of this basilica) mentions the iron rods for\r\n     curtains between the columns of the atrium, and those, still in\r\n     their place, in the porch, with rings for suspending; also a small\r\n     chapel with paintings, at one end of the atrium, designed for those\r\n     penitents who were not allowed to worship within the sacred\r\n     building--as such, an evidence of disciplinary observance, retained\r\n     till the twelfth century. Over the portal are some tiny\r\n     bas-reliefs, so placed along the inner side of the lintel that many\r\n     might pass underneath without seeing them: in the centre, a hand\r\n     blessing, with the Greek action, between two sheep, laterally; the\r\n     four evangelistic emblems, and two doves, each pecking out of a\r\n     vase, and one perched upon a dragon (more like a lizard), to\r\n     signify the victory of the purified soul over mundane\r\n     temptations.\"--_Hemans' Christian Art._\r\n\r\nClose to this church stood the Palace of Pope Gelasius II. (1118).\r\n\r\nOpposite the church is a beautiful fountain, erected by one of the\r\nMedici, and beyond it the graceful round temple now called the _Temple\r\nof Vesta_, supposed by Canina to have been that of Mater Matuta, and by\r\nothers to have been that of Hercules founded by Pompey. It is known to\r\nhave existed in the time of Vespasian. It is very small, the\r\ncircumference of the peristyle being only 156 feet, and that of the\r\ncella 26 feet,--the height of the surrounding Corinthian columns\r\n(originally twenty in number) 32 feet This temple was first dedicated as\r\na church under the name of S. Stefano delle Carrozze; it is now called\r\n_Sta. Maria del Sole_.\r\n\r\nThis is not the Temple of Vesta (which was situated near the Church of\r\nSta. Maria Liberatrice in the Forum) of which Horace wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Vidimus flavum Tiberim, retortis\r\n    Littore Etrusco violenter undis,\r\n    Ire dejectum monumenta regum\r\n                      Templaque Vestæ.\"\r\n\r\n    _Carm._ i. 2.\r\n\r\nThe modern overhanging roof of the temple has been much objected to, as\r\nit replaces an entablature like that on the temple of the Sibyl at\r\nTivoli; but artists admire the exquisite play of light and shade caused\r\nby its rugged tiles, and, finding it a perfect \"subject,\" wish for no\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n     \"C'est auprès de la Bouche-de-Vérité, devant le petit temple de\r\n     Vesta, que la justice romaine exécute un meurtrier sur cent. Quand\r\n     j'arrivai sur la place, on n'y guillotinait personne; mais six\r\n     cuisinières, dont une aussi belle que Junon, dansaient la\r\n     tarantelle au son d'un tambour de basque. Malheureusement elles\r\n     divinèrent ma qualité d'étranger, et elles se mirent à polker\r\n     contre la mesure.\"--_About._\r\n\r\nClose to this--overhanging a little hollow way--is the _Temple of\r\nFortuna Virilis_, built originally by Servius Tullius, but rebuilt\r\nduring the republic, and, if the existing building is really republican,\r\nthe most ancient temple remaining in Rome. It is surrounded by Ionic\r\ncolumns (one side being enclosed in other buildings), 28 feet high,\r\nclothed with hard stucco, and supporting an entablature adorned with\r\nfigures of children, oxen, candelabra, &c. The Roman matrons had a great\r\nregard for this goddess, who was supposed to have the power of\r\nconcealing their personal imperfections from the eyes of men. At the\r\nclose of the tenth century this temple was consecrated to the Virgin,\r\nbut has since been bestowed upon _St. Mary of Egypt_.\r\n\r\nHard by, is a picturesque end of building, laden with rich but\r\nincongruous sculpture, at one time called \"The House of Pilate,\" but now\r\nknown as the _House of Rienzi_. It derives its present name from a long\r\ninscription over a doorway, which tallies with the bombastic epithets\r\nassumed by \"The Last of the Tribunes\" in his pompous letter of Aug. 1,\r\n1347, when, in his semi-madness, he summoned kings and emperors to\r\nappear before his judgment-seat. The inscription closes:--\r\n\r\n    \"Primus de primis magnus Nicolaus ab imis,\r\n    Erexit patrum decus ob renovare suorum.\r\n    Stat patris Crescens matrisque Theodora nomen.\r\n    Hoc culmen clarum caro de pignore gessit,\r\n    Davidi tribuit qui pater exhibuit.\"\r\n\r\nIt is believed, from the inscription, that the house was fortified by\r\nNicholas, son of Crescentius and Theodora, who gave it to David, his\r\nson; that the Crescentius alluded to was son of the famous patrician who\r\nheaded the populace against Otho III.; and that, three centuries later,\r\nthe house may have belonged to Cola di Rienzi, a name which is, in fact,\r\nonly popular language for Niccola Crescenzo. It is, however, known that\r\nRienzi was not born in this house, but in a narrow street behind S.\r\nTommaso, in the Rione alla Regola, where his father Lorenzo kept an inn,\r\nand his mother, Maddalena, gained her daily bread as a washerwoman and\r\nwater-carrier--so were the Crescenzi fallen!\r\n\r\nHere is the entrance to a suspension-bridge, which joins the remaining\r\narches of the _Ponte Rotto_, and leads to the Trastevere. On this site\r\nwas the Pons Æmilius, begun, B.C. 180, by M. Æmilius Lepidus and Marcus\r\nFulvius Nobilior, and finished by P. Scipio Africanus and L. Mummius,\r\nthe censors, in B.C. 142. Hence the body of the Emperor Heliogabalus was\r\nthrown into the Tiber. The bridge has been three times rebuilt by\r\ndifferent popes, but two of its arches were finally carried away in an\r\ninundation of 1598, and have never since been replaced. The existing\r\nremains, which only date from the time of Julius III., are highly\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\n     \"Quand on a établi un pont en fil de fer, on lui a donné pour base\r\n     les piles du Ponte-Rotto, élevé au moyen âge sur les fondements du\r\n     Pons Palatinus, qui fut achevé sous la censure de Scipion\r\n     l'Africain. Scipion l'Africain et un pont en fil de fer, voilà de\r\n     ces contrastes qu'on ne trouve qu'à Rome.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 209.\r\n\r\nFrom this bridge is the best view of the Isola Tiberina and its bridges,\r\nand hence, also, the Temple of Vesta is seen to great advantage. Just\r\nbelow is the mouth of the Cloaca Maxima.\r\n\r\n     \"Quand du Ponte-Rotto on considère le triple cintre de l'ouverture\r\n     par laquelle la Cloaca Maxima se déchargeait dans le Tibre, on a\r\n     devant les yeux un monument qui rappelle beaucoup de grandeur et\r\n     beaucoup d'oppression. Ce monument extraordinaire est une page\r\n     importante de l'histoire romaine. Il est à la fois la suprême\r\n     expression de la puissance des rois étrusques et le signe\r\n     avant-coureur de leur chute. L'on croit voir l'arc triomphal de la\r\n     royauté par où devait entrer la république.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._\r\n     ii. 233.\r\n\r\nIn the bed of the river a little lower down may be seen, at low water,\r\nsome massive fragments of masonry. Here stood the _Pons Sublicius_, the\r\noldest bridge in Rome, built by Ancus Martius (B.C. 639), on which\r\nHoratius Cocles and his two companions \"kept the bridge\" against the\r\nEtruscan army of Lars Porsenna, till--\r\n\r\n    \"Back darted Spurius Lartius;\r\n      Herminius darted back:\r\n    And, as they passed, beneath their feet\r\n      They felt the timbers crack.\r\n    But when they turned their faces,\r\n      And on the farther shore\r\n    Saw brave Horatius stand alone,\r\n      They would have crossed once more.\r\n\r\n    \"But with a crash like thunder\r\n      Fell every loosened beam,\r\n    And, like a dam, the mighty wreck\r\n      Lay right athwart the stream:\r\n    And a long shout of triumph\r\n      Rose from the walls of Rome,\r\n    As to the highest turret-tops\r\n      Was splashed the yellow foam.\"\r\n\r\n    _Macaulay's Lays._\r\n\r\nThe name \"Sublicius\" came from the wooden beams of its construction,\r\nwhich enabled the Romans to cut it away. The bridge was rebuilt by\r\nTiberius and again by Antoninus Pius, each time of beams, but upon stone\r\npiers, of which the present remains are fragments, the rest having been\r\ndestroyed by an inundation in the time of Adrian I.\r\n\r\nOn the Trastevere bank, between these two bridges, half hidden in shrubs\r\nand ivy (but worth examination in a boat), are two gigantic _Heads of\r\nLions_, to which in ancient times chains were fastened, and drawn across\r\nthe river to prevent hostile vessels from passing.\r\n\r\nNear this we enter the _Via S. Giovanni Decollato_, decorated with\r\nnumerous heads of John the Baptist in the dish, let into the walls over\r\nthe doors of the houses. The \"Confraternità della Misericordia di S.\r\nGiovanni Decollato,\" founded in 1488, devote themselves to criminals\r\ncondemned to death. They visit them in prison, accompany them to\r\nexecution, receive their bodies, and offer masses for their souls in\r\ntheir little chapel. Vasari gives the highest praise to two pictures of\r\nFrancesco Salviati in the Church of S. Giov. Decollato, \"before which\r\nall Rome stood still in admiration,\"--representing the appearance of the\r\nangel to Zacharias, and the meeting of the Virgin and Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nOn the left is the _Hospital of Sta. Galla_, commemorating the pious\r\nfoundation of a Roman matron in the time of John I. (523--526), who\r\nattained such celebrity, that she is still commemorated in the Roman\r\nmass by the prayer--\r\n\r\n     \"Almighty and merciful God, who didst adorn the blessed Galla with\r\n     the virtue of a wonderful love towards thy poor; grant us, through\r\n     her merits and prayers, to practise works of love, and to obtain\r\n     Thy mercy, through the Lord, &c. Amen.\"\r\n\r\nOn, or very near this site, stood the _Porta Carmentalis_, which, with\r\nthe temple beside it, commemorated Carmenta, the supposed mother of\r\nEvander, a Sabine prophetess, who is made by Ovid to predict the future\r\ngrandeur of Rome.[88] Carmenta was especially invoked by women in\r\nchildbirth. The Porta Carmentalis was reached from the Forum by the\r\nVicus Jugarius. It was by this route that the Fabii went forth to meet\r\ntheir doom in the valley of the Crimera. The Porta had two gates--one\r\nfor those who entered, the other for those who left it, so that in each\r\ncase the passenger passed through the \"Janus,\" as it was called, upon\r\nhis right. After the massacre of the Fabii, the road by which they left\r\nthe city was avoided, and the Janus Carmentalis on the right was closed,\r\nand called the Porta Scelerata.\r\n\r\n    \"Carmentis portæ dextro via proxima Jano est\r\n    Ire per hanc noli, quisquis es; omen habet.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ ii. 201.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the Porta Carmentalis was the district called _Tarentum_,\r\nwhere there was a subterranean \"Ara Ditis Patris et Proserpinæ.\"\r\n\r\nWe now reach (left) the _Church of S. Nicolo in Carcere_. It has a mean\r\nfront, with an inscription in honour of one of the Aldobrandini family,\r\nand is only interesting as occupying the site of the three _Temples of\r\nJuno Matuta, Piety(?), and Hope_, which are believed to mark the site of\r\nthe Forum Olitorium. The vaults beneath the church contain the massive\r\nsubstructions of these temples, and fragments of their columns.\r\n\r\nThe central temple is believed to be that of Piety, built by M. Acilius\r\nGlabrio, the duumvir, in B.C. 165 (though Pliny says that this temple\r\nwas on the site afterwards occupied by the theatre of Marcellus), in\r\nfulfilment of a vow made by his father, a consul of the same name, on\r\nthe day of his defeating the forces of Antiochus the Great, king of\r\nSyria, at Thermopylæ. Others endeavour to identify it with the temple\r\nbuilt on the site of the Decemviral prisons, to keep up the recollection\r\nof the famous story, called the \"Caritas Romana,\"--of a woman condemned\r\nto die of hunger in prison being nourished by the milk of her own\r\ndaughter. Pliny and Valerius Maximus tell the story as of a mother;\r\nFestus only speaks of a father;[89]--yet art and poetry have always\r\nfollowed the latter legend. A cell is shown, by torchlight, as the scene\r\nof this touching incident.\r\n\r\n    \"There is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light\r\n    What do I gaze on? Nothing. Look again!\r\n    Two forms are slowly shadowed on my sight--\r\n    Two insulated phantoms of the brain:\r\n    It is not so; I see them full and plain--\r\n    An old man, and a female young and fair,\r\n    Fresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein\r\n    The blood is nectar:--but what doth she there,\r\n    With her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?\r\n\r\n    \"But here youth offers to old age the food,\r\n    The milk of his own gift:--it is her sire,\r\n    To whom she renders back the debt of blood\r\n    Born with her birth. No, he shall not expire\r\n    While in those warm and lovely veins the fire\r\n    Of health and holy feeling can provide\r\n    Great Nature's Nile, whose deep stream rises higher\r\n    Than Egypt's river;--from that gentle side\r\n    Drink, drink, and live, old man! Heaven's realm holds no such tide.\r\n\r\n    \"The starry fable of the milky-way\r\n    Has not thy story's purity; it is\r\n    A constellation of a sweeter ray,\r\n    And sacred Nature triumphs more in this\r\n    Reverse of her decree, than in the abyss\r\n    Where sparkle distant worlds:--Oh, holiest nurse!\r\n    No drop of that clear stream its way shall miss\r\n    To thy sire's heart, replenishing its source\r\n    With life, as our freed souls rejoin the universe.\"\r\n\r\n    _Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nA memorial of this story of a prison is preserved in the name of the\r\nchurch--S. Nicolo _in Carcere_. It was probably owing to this legend\r\nthat, in front of the Temple of Piety, was placed the _Columna\r\nLactaria_, where infants were exposed, in the hope that some one would\r\ntake pity upon and nurse them out of charity.\r\n\r\nA wide opening out of the street near this, with a pretty fountain, is\r\ncalled the _Piazza Montanara_, and is one of the places where the\r\ncountry people collect and wait for hire.\r\n\r\n     \"Le dimanche est le jour où les paysans arrivent à Rome. Ceux qui\r\n     cherchent l'emploi de leurs bras viennent se louer aux marchands de\r\n     campagne, c'est-à-dire aux fermiers. Ceux qui sont loués et qui\r\n     travaillent hors des murs viennent faire leurs affaires et\r\n     renouveler leurs provisions. Ils entrent en ville au petit jour\r\n     après avoir marché une bonne partie de la nuit. Chaque famille\r\n     amène un âne, qui porte le bagage. Hommes, femmes, et enfants,\r\n     poussant leur âne devant eux, s'établissent dans un coin de la\r\n     place Farnèse, ou de la place Montanara. Les boutiques voisines\r\n     restent ouvertes jusqu'à midi, par un privilège spécial. On va, on\r\n     vient, on achète, on s'accroupit dans les coins pour compter les\r\n     pièces de cuivre. Cependant les ânes se reposent sur leurs quatre\r\n     pieds au bord des fontaines. Les femmes, vêtues d'un corset en\r\n     cuirasse, d'un tablier rouge, et d'une veste rayée, encadrent leur\r\n     figure hâlée dans une draperie de linge très-blanc. Elles sont\r\n     toutes à peindre sans exception: quand ce n'est pas pour la beauté\r\n     de leurs traits, c'est pour l'élégance naïve de leurs attitudes.\r\n     Les hommes ont le long manteau bleu de ciel et le chapeau pointu;\r\n     là-dessous leurs habits de travail font merveille, quoique roussis\r\n     par le temps et couleur de perdrix. Le costume n'est pas uniforme;\r\n     on voit plus d'un manteau amadou rapiécé de bleu vif ou de rouge\r\n     garance. Le chapeau de paille abonde en été. La chaussure est\r\n     très-capricieuse; soulier, botte et sandale foulent successivement\r\n     le pavé. Les déchaussés trouvent ici près de grandes et profondes\r\n     boutiques où l'on vend des marchandises d'occasion. Il y a des\r\n     souliers de tout cuir et de tout âge dans ces trésors de la\r\n     chaussure; on y trouverait des cothurnes de l'an 500 de la\r\n     république, en cherchant bien. Je viens de voir un pauvre diable\r\n     qui essayait une paire de bottes à revers. Elles vont à ses jambes\r\n     comme une plume à l'oreille d'un porc, et c'est plaisir de voir la\r\n     grimace qu'il fait chaque fois qu'il pose le pied à terre. Mais le\r\n     marchand le fortifie par de bonnes paroles: 'Ne crains rien,' lui\r\n     dit-il, 'tu souffriras pendant cinq ou six jours, et puis tu n'y\r\n     penseras plus.' Un autre marchand débite des clous à la livre: le\r\n     chaland les enfonce lui-même dans ses semelles; il y a des bancs\r\n     _ad hoc_. Le long des murs, cinq ou six chaises de paille servent\r\n     de boutique à autant de barbiers en plein vent. Il en coute un sou\r\n     pour abattre une barbe de huit jours. Le patient, barbouillé de\r\n     savon, regarde le ciel d'un œil résigné; le barbier lui tire le\r\n     nez, lui met les doigts dans la bouche, s'interrompt pour aiguiser\r\n     le rasoir sur un cuir attaché au dossier de la chaise, ou pour\r\n     écorner une galette noire qui pend au mur. Cependant l'opération\r\n     est faite en un tour de main; le rasé se lève et sa place est\r\n     prise. Il pourrait aller se laver à la fontaine, mais il trouve\r\n     plus simple de s'essuyer du revers de sa manche.\r\n\r\n     \"Les écrivains publics alternent avec les barbiers. On leur apporte\r\n     les lettres qu'on a reçues; ils les lisent et font la réponse:\r\n     total, trois sous. Dès qu'un paysan s'approche de la table pour\r\n     dicter quelque-chose, cinq ou six curieux se réunissent\r\n     officieusement autour de lui pour mieux entendre. Il y a une\r\n     certaine bonhomie dans cette indiscrétion. Chacun place son mot,\r\n     chacun donne un conseil: 'Tu devrais dire ceci.'--'Non; dis plutôt\r\n     cela.'--'Laissez-le parler,' crie un troisième, 'il sait mieux que\r\n     vous ce qu'il veut faire écrire.'\r\n\r\n     \"Quelques voitures chargées de galettes d'orge et de maïs circulent\r\n     au milieu de la foule.

Le gourmet\r\n     achète des viandes d'occasion devant un petit étalage, où les\r\n     rebuts de cuisine se vendent à la poignée.

This huge edifice seems to have been projected by Julius\r\nCaesar, but he probably made little progress in it. It was actually\r\nerected by Augustus, and dedicated (_c._ 13 B.C.) in memory of the young\r\nnephew whom he married to his daughter Julia, and intended as his\r\nsuccessor, but who was cut off by an early death. The theatre was\r\ncapable of containing 20,000 spectators, and consisted of three tiers of\r\narches, but the upper range has disappeared, and the lower is very\r\nimperfect. Still it is a grand remnant, and rises magnificently above\r\nthe paltry houses which surround it. The perfect proportions of its\r\nDoric and Ionic columns served as models to Palladio.\r\n\r\n     \"Le mur extérieur du portique demi-circulaire qui enveloppait les\r\n     gradins offre encore à notre admiration deux étages d'arceaux et de\r\n     colonnes doriques et ioniques d'une beauté presque grecque. L'étage\r\n     supérieur, qui devait être corinthien, a disparu. Les _fornices_,\r\n     ou voûtes du rez-de chaussée, sont habitées encore aujourd'hui\r\n     comme elles l'étaient dans l'antiquité, mais plus honnêtement, par\r\n     de pauvres gens qui vendent des ferrailles. Au-dessous des belles\r\n     colonnes de l'enceinte extérieure, on a construit des maisons\r\n     modernes dans lesquelles sont pratiquées des fenêtres, et à ces\r\n     fenêtres du théâtre de Marcellus, on voit des pots à fleurs, ni\r\n     plus ni moins qu à une mansarde de la rue Saint Denis; des chemises\r\n     sèchent sur l'entablement; des cheminées surmontent la ruine\r\n     romaine, et un grand tube se dessine à l'extrémité.\r\n\r\n     \"Dans les jeux célébrés à l'occasion de la dédicace du théâtre de\r\n     Marcellus, on vit pour la première fois un tigre apprivoisé,\r\n     _tigrim mansuefactum_.

Leur tribunal, aussi régulièrement constitué\r\n     que pas un, s'appellait Corte Savella.[90] Ils avaient le droit\r\n     d'arracher tous les ans un criminel à la peine de mort: droit de\r\n     grâce, droit régalien reconnu par la monarchie absolue des papes.\r\n     Les femmes de cette illustre famille ne sortaient point de leurs\r\n     palais sinon dans un carosse bien fermé. Les Orsini et les Colonna\r\n     se vantaient que pendant les siècles, aucun traité de paix n'avait\r\n     été conclu entre les princes chrétiens, dans lequel ils n'eussent\r\n     été nominativement compris.\"--_About._\r\n\r\nThe palace has now passed to the family of Orsini-Gravina, who descended\r\nfrom a senator of A.D. 1200. The princes of Orsini and Colonna, in\r\ntheir quality as attendants on the throne (_principi assistenti al\r\nsoglio_), take precedence of all other Roman nobles.\r\n\r\n     \"Nicolovius will remember the Theatre of Marcellus, in which the\r\n     Savelli family built a palace. My house is half of it. It has stood\r\n     empty for a considerable time, because the drive into the courtyard\r\n     (the interior of the ancient theatre) rises like the slope of a\r\n     mountain upon the heaps of rubbish; although the road has been cut\r\n     in a zig-zag, it is still a break-neck affair. There is another\r\n     entrance from the Piazza Montanara, whence a flight of\r\n     seventy-three steps leads up to the same story I have mentioned;\r\n     the entrance-hall of which is on a level with the top of the\r\n     carriage-way through the courtyard. The apartments in which we\r\n     shall live are those over the colonnade of Ionic pillars forming\r\n     the third story of the ancient theatre, and some, on a level with\r\n     them, which have been built out like wings on the rubbish of the\r\n     ruins. These enclose a little quadrangular garden, which is indeed\r\n     very small, only about eighty or ninety feet long, and scarcely so\r\n     broad, but so delightful! It contains three fountains--an abundance\r\n     of flowers: there are orange-trees on the wall between the windows,\r\n     and jessamine under them. We mean to plant a vine besides. From\r\n     this story, you ascend forty steps, or more, higher, where I mean\r\n     to have my own study, and there are most cheerful little rooms,\r\n     from which you have a prospect over the whole country beyond the\r\n     Tiber, Monte Mario, and St. Peter's, and can see over St. Pietro in\r\n     Montorio, indeed almost as far as the Aventine. It would, I think,\r\n     be possible besides to erect a loggia upon the roof (for which I\r\n     shall save money from other things), that we may have a view over\r\n     the Capitol, Forum, Palatine, Coliseum, and all the inhabited parts\r\n     of the city.\"--_Niebuhr's Letters._\r\n\r\nFollowing the wall of the theatre, down a filthy street, we arrive at\r\nthe picturesque group of ruins of the \"Porticus Octaviæ,\" erected by\r\nAugustus, in honour of his sister (the unhappy wife of Antony), close to\r\nthe theatre to which he had given the name of her son. The exact form of\r\nthe building is known from the Pianta Capitolina,--that it was a\r\nparallelogram, surrounded by a double arcade of 270 columns, and\r\nenclosing the temples of Jupiter and Juno, built by the Greek\r\narchitects, Batracus and Saurus.[91]\r\n\r\nWith regard to these temples, Pliny narrates a fact which reminds one of\r\nthe story of the Madonna of Sta. Maria Nuova.[92] The porters having\r\ncarelessly carried the statues of the gods to the wrong temples, it was\r\nimagined that they had done so from divine inspiration, and the people\r\nwould not venture to remove them, so that the statues always remained\r\nwhere they had been placed, though their surroundings were utterly\r\nunsuitable.\r\n\r\nThe _Portico of Octavia_ built by Augustus, occupied the site of an\r\nearlier portico--the Porticus Metelli--built by A. Cæcilius Metellus,\r\nafter his triumph over Andriscus in Macedonia, in B.C. 146. Temples of\r\nJupiter Stator and Juno existed also in this portico, one of them being\r\nthe earliest temple built of marble in Rome. Before these temples\r\nMetellus placed the famous group of twenty-five bronze statues, which he\r\nhad brought from Greece, executed by Lysippus for Alexander the Great,\r\nand representing that conqueror himself and twenty-four horsemen of his\r\ntroop who had fallen at the Granicus.[93]\r\n\r\nThe existing fragment of the portico is the original entrance to the\r\nwhole. The building had suffered from fire in the reign of Titus, and\r\nwas restored by Septimius Severus, and of this time is the large brick\r\narch on one side of the ruin.\r\n\r\n     \"It was in this hall of Octavia that Titus and Vespasian celebrated\r\n     their triumph over Israel with festive pomp and splendour. Among\r\n     the Jewish spectators stood the historian Flavius Josephus, who was\r\n     one of the followers and flatterers of Titus ... and to this base\r\n     Jewish courtier we owe a description of the\r\n     triumph.\"--_Gregorovius, Wanderjahre in Italien._\r\n\r\nWithin the portico is the _Church of S. Angelo in Pescheria_. Here it\r\nwas that Cola Rienzi summoned, at midnight--May 20, 1347--all good\r\ncitizens to hold a meeting for the re-establishment of \"the good\r\nestate;\" here he kept the vigil of the Holy Ghost; and hence he went\r\nforth, bareheaded, in complete armour, accompanied by the papal legate,\r\nand attended by a vast multitude, to the Capitol, where he called upon\r\nthe populace to ratify the Good Estate.\r\n\r\nIt is said that one of the causes which most incited the indignation of\r\nRienzi against the assumption and pride of the Roman families, was the\r\nfact of their painting their arms on the ancient Roman buildings, and\r\nthus in a manner appropriating them to their own glory. Remains of coats\r\nof arms thus painted may be seen on the front wall of the Portico of\r\nOctavia. It was also on this very wall that Rienzi painted his famous\r\nallegorical picture. In this painting kings and men of the people were\r\nseen burning in a furnace, with a woman half consumed, who personified\r\nRome,--and on the right was a church, whence issued a white-robed angel,\r\nbearing in one hand a naked sword, while with the other he plucked the\r\nwoman from the flames. On the church tower were SS. Peter and Paul,\r\ncrying to the angel, \"Aquilo, aquilo, succurri a l'albergatrice\r\nnostra,\"--and beyond this were represented falcons (typical of the Roman\r\nbarons) falling from heaven into the flames, and a white dove bearing a\r\nwreath of olive, which it gave to a little bird (Rienzi), which was\r\nchased by the falcons. Beneath was inscribed: \"I see the time of great\r\njustice, do thou await that time.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Then turn we to her latest tribune's name,\r\n    From her ten thousand tyrants turn to thee,\r\n    Redeemer of dark centuries of shame--\r\n    The friend of Petrarch--hope of Italy--\r\n    Rienzi! last of Romans! While the tree\r\n    Of Freedom's wither'd trunk puts forth a leaf,\r\n    Even for thy tomb a garland let it be--\r\n    The forum's champion, and the people's chief--\r\n    Her newborn Numa thou--with reign, alas! too brief.\"\r\n\r\n    _Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nThrough the brick arch of the Portico we enter upon the ancient\r\n_Pescheria_, with the marble fish-slabs of imperial times still\r\nremaining in use. It is a striking scene--the dark, many-storied houses\r\nalmost meeting overhead and framing a narrow strip of deep blue\r\nsky,--below, the bright groups of figures and rich colouring of hanging\r\ncloths and drapery.\r\n\r\n     \"C'est une des ruines les plus remarquables de Rome, et une de\r\n     celles qui offrent ces contrastes piquants entre le passé et le\r\n     présent, amusement perpétuel de l'imagination dans la ville des\r\n     contrastes. Le portique d'Octavie est, aujourd'hui, le marché aux\r\n     poissons.

The\r\nfirst Jewish slaves were brought to Rome by Pompey the Great, after he\r\nhad taken Jerusalem, and forcibly entered the Holy of Holies. But for\r\ncenturies after this they lived in Rome in wealth and honour, their\r\nprinces Herod and Agrippa being received with royal distinction, and\r\nfinding a home in the Palace of the Cæsars,--in which Berenice (or\r\nVeronica), the daughter of Agrippa, presided as the acknowledged\r\nmistress of Titus, who would willingly have made her empress of Rome.\r\nThe chief Jewish settlement in imperial times was nearly on the site of\r\ntheir present abode, but they were not compelled to live here, and also\r\nhad a large colony in the Trastevere; and when St. Peter was at Rome (if\r\nthe Church tradition be true), he dwelt, with Aquila and Priscilla, on\r\nthe slopes of the Aventine. Julius, Augustus, and Tiberius Cæsar treated\r\nthe Jews with kindness, but under Caligula they already met with\r\nill-treatment and contempt,--that emperor being especially irritated\r\nagainst them as the only nation which refused to yield him divine\r\nhonours, and because they had successfully resisted the placing of his\r\nstatue in the Holy of Holies at Jerusalem. On the destruction of\r\nJerusalem by Titus, thousands of Jewish slaves were brought to Rome, and\r\nwere employed on the building of the Coliseum. At the same time\r\nVespasian, while allowing the Hebrews in Rome the free exercise of their\r\nreligion, obliged them to pay the tax of half a skekel, formerly paid\r\ninto the Temple treasury, to Jupiter Capitolinus,--and this custom is\r\nstill kept up in the annual tribute paid by the Jews in the Camera\r\nCapitolina.\r\n\r\nUnder Domitian the Jews were banished from the city to the valley of\r\nEgeria, where they lived in a state of poverty and outlawry, which is\r\ndescribed by Juvenal,[94] and occupied themselves with soothsaying,\r\nlove-charms, magic-potions, and mysterious cures.[95]\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of the earlier popes, the Jews at Rome enjoyed a great\r\namount of liberty, and the anti-pope Anacletus II. (ob. 1138) was even\r\nthe grandson of a baptized Jew, whose family bore a leading part in\r\nRome, as one of the great patrician houses. The clemency with which the\r\nJews were regarded was, however, partly due to their skill as\r\nphysicians,--and long after their persecutions had begun (as late as\r\nMartin V., 1417--31), the physician of the Vatican was a Jew. The first\r\nreally bitter enemy of the Jews was Eugenius IV. (Gabriele Condolmiere,\r\n1431--39), who forbade Christians to trade, to eat, or to dwell with\r\nthem, and prohibited them from walking in the streets, from building new\r\nsynagogues, or from occupying any public post. Paul II. (1468) increased\r\ntheir humiliation by compelling them to run races during the Carnival,\r\nas the horses run now, amidst the hoots of the populace. This custom\r\ncontinued for two hundred years. Sprenger's \"Roma Nuova\" of 1667,\r\nmentions that \"the asses ran first, then the Jews--naked, with only a\r\nband round their loins--then the buffaloes, then the Barbary horses.\"\r\nIt was Clement IX. (Rospigliosi), in 1668, who first permitted the Jews\r\nto pay a sum equivalent to 1500 francs annually instead of racing.\r\n\r\n     \"On the first Saturday in Carnival, it was the custom for the heads\r\n     of the Jews in Rome to appear as a deputation before the\r\n     Conservators in the Capitol. Throwing themselves upon their knees,\r\n     they offered a nosegay and twenty scudi with the request that this\r\n     might be employed to ornament the balcony in which the Roman Senate\r\n     sate in the Piazza del Popolo. In like manner they went to the\r\n     senator, and, after the ancient custom, implored permission to\r\n     remain in Rome. The senator placed his foot on their foreheads,\r\n     ordered them to stand up, and replied in the accustomed formula,\r\n     that Jews were not adopted in Rome, but allowed from compassion to\r\n     remain there. This humiliation has now disappeared, but the Jews\r\n     still go to the Capitol, on the first Saturday of Carnival, to\r\n     offer their homage and tribute for the pallii of the horses, which\r\n     they have to provide, in memory that now the horses amuse the\r\n     people in their stead.\"--_Gregorovius, Wanderjahre._\r\n\r\nThe Jews were first shut up within the walls of the Ghetto by the\r\nfanatical Dominican pope, Paul IV. (Gio. Pietro Caraffa, 1555--59), and\r\ncommanded never to appear outside it, unless the men were in yellow\r\nhats, or the women in yellow veils. \"For,\" says the Bull Cum Nimis,\r\n\r\n     \"It is most absurd and unsuitable that the Jews, whose own crime\r\n     has plunged them into everlasting slavery, under the plea that\r\n     Christian magnanimity allows them, should presume to dwell and mix\r\n     with Christians, not bearing any mark of distinction, and should\r\n     have Christian servants, yea, even buy houses.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ghetto, or Vicus Judæorum, as it was at first called, was shut in by\r\nwalls which reached from the Ponte Quattro Capi to the Piazza del\r\nPianto, or \"Place of Weeping,\" whose name bears witness to the grief of\r\nthe people on the 26th July, 1556, when they were first forced into\r\ntheir prison-house.\r\n\r\n     \"Those Jews who were shut up in the Ghetto were placed in\r\n     possession of the dwellings of others. The houses in that quarter\r\n     were the property of Romans, and some of them were inhabited by\r\n     families of consideration, such as the Boccapaduli. When these\r\n     removed they remained the proprietors and the Jews only tenants.\r\n     But as they were to live for ever in these streets, it was\r\n     necessary that the Jews should have a perpetual lease to defend\r\n     them against a twofold danger,--negligence on the part of the owner\r\n     to announce to his Jewish tenant when his possession expired, or\r\n     bankruptcy if the owner raised his rent. Thus originated a law\r\n     which established that the Romans should remain in possession of\r\n     the dwellings let to the Jews, but that the latter should hold the\r\n     houses in fee farm; that is, the expiration of the contract cannot\r\n     be announced to a Jewish tenant, and so long as he pays the lawful\r\n     rent, the rent can never be raised; the Jew at the same time may\r\n     alter or enlarge his house as he chooses. This still existing\r\n     privilege is called the Jus Gazzaga. By virtue of it a Jew is in\r\n     hereditary possession of the lease, and can sell it to his\r\n     relations or others, and to the present day it is a costly fortune\r\n     to be in possession of a Jus Gazzaga, or a hereditary lease. Highly\r\n     extolled is the Jewish maiden who brings her bridegroom such a\r\n     dowry. Through this salutary law the Jew became possessed of a\r\n     home, which to some extent he may call his own.\"--_Gregorovius._\r\n\r\nThe Jews were kindly treated by Sixtus V. on the plea that they were\r\n\"the family from whom Christ came,\" and he allowed them to practise many\r\nkinds of trades, and to have intercourse with Christians, and to build\r\nhouses, libraries, and synagogues, but his mild laws were all repealed\r\nby Clement VIII. (Aldobrandini, 1592--1605), and under Clement XI. and\r\nInnocent XIII. all trade was forbidden them, except that in old-clothes,\r\nrags, and iron, \"stracci feracci.\" To these Benedict XIV. (Lambertini)\r\nadded trade in drapery, with which they are still largely occupied.\r\nUnder Gregory XIII. (Buoncompagni, 1572--85) the Jews were forced to\r\nhear a sermon every week in the church, first of S. Benedetto alla\r\nRegola, then in S. Angelo in Peschiera, and every Sabbath police-agents\r\nwere sent into the Ghetto to drive men, women, and children into the\r\nchurch with scourges, and to lash them while there if they appeared to\r\nbe inattentive.\r\n\r\n     \"Now was come about Holy Cross Day, and now must my lord preach his\r\n     first sermon to the Jews: as it was of old cared for in the\r\n     merciful bowels of the Church, that, so to speak, a crumb at least\r\n     from her conspicuous table here in Rome, should be, though but once\r\n     yearly, cast to the famishing dogs, undertrampled and bespitten\r\n     upon beneath the feet of the guests; and a moving sight in truth\r\n     this, of so many of the besotted, blind, restive, and\r\n     ready-to-perish Hebrews! now maternally brought--nay (for He saith,\r\n     'Compel them to come in'), haled, as it were, by the head and hair,\r\n     and against their obstinate hearts, to partake of the heavenly\r\n     grace....\"--_Diary by the Bishop's Secretary,_ 1600.\r\n\r\nThough what the Jews really said, on thus being driven to church, was\r\nrather to this effect:--\r\n\r\n                   IX.\r\n\r\n    \"Groan all together now, whee-hee-hee!\r\n    It's a-work, it's a-work, ah, woe is me!\r\n    It began, when a herd of us, picked and placed,\r\n    Were spurred through the Corso, stripped to the waist;\r\n    Jew-brutes, with sweat and blood well spent\r\n    To usher in worthily Christian Lent.\r\n\r\n                    X.\r\n\r\n    'It grew, when the hangman entered our bounds,\r\n    Yelled, pricked us out to his church like hounds.\r\n    It got to a pitch, when the hand indeed\r\n    Which gutted my purse, would throttle my creed.\r\n    And it overflows, when, to even the odd,\r\n    Men I helped to their sins, help me to their God.\"\r\n\r\n    _R. B. Browning, Holy Cross Day._\r\n\r\nThis custom of compelling Jews to listen to Christian sermons was\r\nrenewed by Leo XII., and was only abolished in the early years of Pius\r\nIX. The walls of the Ghetto also remained, and its gates were closed at\r\nnight until the reign of the present pope, who removed the limits of the\r\nGhetto, and revoked all the oppressive laws against the Jews. The humane\r\nfeeling with which he regarded this hitherto oppressed race is said to\r\nhave been first evinced,--when, on the occasion of his placing a liberal\r\nalms in the hand of a beggar, one of his attendants interposed, saying,\r\n\"It is a Jew!\" and the pope replied, \"What does that matter, it is a\r\nman?\"\r\n\r\n     \"The present population of the Ghetto is estimated at 3800, a\r\n     number out of all proportion, considering the small size of the\r\n     Ghetto, which covers less space than the fifth part of any small\r\n     town of 3000 inhabitants. The Jews are under the chief congregation\r\n     of the Inquisition, and their especial magistrate for all civil and\r\n     criminal processes is the Cardinal Vicar. The tribunal which\r\n     governs them consists of the Cardinal Vicar, the Prelato\r\n     Vicegerente, the Prelato Luogo-tenente Civile, and the Criminal\r\n     Lieutenant. In police matters, the President of the Region of S.\r\n     Angelo and Campitelli exercises the local police magistracy. The\r\n     Jewish community has itself the right of regulating its internal\r\n     order by the so-called Fattori del Ghetto, chosen every half-year.\r\n     The common tribute of the Ghetto to the state, and to various\r\n     religious bodies, amounts to about 13,000 francs.\"\r\n\r\nOpposite the gate of the Ghetto near the Ponte Quattro Capi a converted\r\nJew erected a church, which is still to be seen, with a painting of the\r\nCrucifixion on its outside wall (upon which every Jew must look as he\r\ncomes out of the Ghetto), and underneath an inscription in large letters\r\nof Hebrew and Latin from Isaiah, lxv. 2:--\"All day long I have stretched\r\nout my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.\" The lower streets\r\nof the Ghetto, especially the Fiumara, which is nearest to the banks of\r\nthe Tiber, are annually overflowed during the spring rains and melting\r\nof the mountain snows, which is productive of great misery and distress.\r\nYet in spite of this, and of the teeming population crowded into its\r\nnarrow alleys, the mortality was less here during the cholera than in\r\nany other part of Rome, and malaria is unknown here, a freedom from\r\ndisease which may perhaps be attributed to the Jewish custom of\r\nwhitewashing their dwellings at every festival. There is no Jewish\r\nhospital, and if the Jews go to an ordinary hospital, they must submit\r\nto a crucifix being hung over their beds. It is remarkable that the very\r\ncentre of the Jewish settlement should be the Portico of Octavia, in\r\nwhich Vespasian and Titus celebrated their triumph after the fall of\r\nJerusalem. Here and there in the narrow alleys the seven-branched\r\ncandlestick may be seen carved on the house walls, a \"yet living symbol\r\nof the Jewish religion.\"\r\n\r\nEverything may be obtained in the Ghetto: precious stones, lace,\r\nfurniture of all kinds, rich embroidery from Algiers and Constantinople,\r\nstriped stuffs from Spain,--but all is concealed and under cover. \"Cosa\r\ncercate,\" the Jew shopkeepers hiss at you as you thread their narrow\r\nalleys, and try to entice you into a bargain with them. The same article\r\nis often passed on by a mutual arrangement from shop to shop, and meets\r\nyou wherever you go. On Friday evening all shops are shut, and bread is\r\nbaked for the Sabbath, all merchandise is removed, and the men go to the\r\nsynagogue, and wish each other \"a good Sabbath,\" on their return.[96]\r\n\r\nIn the Piazza della Scuola are five schools under one roof--the Scuola\r\ndel Tempio, Catilana, Castigliana, Siciliana, and the Scuola Nuova,\r\n\"which show that the Roman Ghetto is divided into five districts or\r\nparishes, each of which represents a particular race, according to the\r\nprevailing nationality of the Jews, whose fathers have been either\r\nRoman-Jewish from ancient times, or have been brought hither from Spain\r\nand Sicily; the Temple-district is said above all others to assert its\r\ndescent from the Jews of Titus.\" In the same piazza, is the chief\r\nsynagogue, richly adorned with sculpture and gilding. On the external\r\nfrieze are represented in stucco the seven-branched candlestick, David's\r\nharp, and Miriam's timbrel. The interior is highly picturesque and\r\nquaint, and is hung with curious tapestries on festas. The frieze which\r\nsurrounds it represents the temple of Solomon with all its sacred\r\nvessels. A round window in the north wall, divided into twelve panes of\r\ncoloured glass, is symbolical of the twelve tribes of Israel, and a type\r\nof the Urim and Thummim. \"To the west is the round choir, a wooden desk\r\nfor singers and precentors. Opposite, in the eastern wall, is the Holy\r\nof Holies, with projecting staves (as if for the carrying of the ark)\r\nresting on Corinthian columns. It is covered by a curtain, on which\r\ntexts and various devices of roses and tasteful arabesques in the style\r\nof Solomon's temple are embroidered in gold. The seven-branched\r\ncandlestick crowns the whole. In this Holy of Holies lies the sealed\r\nPentateuch, a large parchment roll. This is borne in procession through\r\nthe hall and exhibited from the desk towards all the points of the\r\ncompass, whereat the Jews raise their arms and utter a cry.\"\r\n\r\n     \"On entering the Ghetto, we see Israel before its tents, in full\r\n     restless labour and activity. The people sit in their doorways, or\r\n     outside in the streets, which receive hardly more light than the\r\n     damp and gloomy chambers, and grub amid their old trumpery, or\r\n     patch and sew diligently. It is inexpressible what a chaos of\r\n     shreds and patches (called _Cenci_ in Italian) is here accumulated.\r\n     The whole world seems to be lying about in countless rags and\r\n     scraps, as Jewish plunder. The fragments lie in heaps before the\r\n     doors, they are of every kind and colour,--gold fringes, scraps of\r\n     silk brocade, bits of velvet, red patches, blue patches, orange,\r\n     yellow, black and white, torn, old, slashed and tattered pieces,\r\n     large and small. I never saw such varied rubbish. The Jews might\r\n     mend up all creation with it, and patch the whole world as gaily as\r\n     harlequin's coat. There they sit and grub in their sea of rags, as\r\n     though seeking for treasures, at least for a lost gold brocade. For\r\n     they are as good antiquarians as any of those in Rome, who grovel\r\n     amongst the ruins to bring to light the stump of a column, a\r\n     fragment of a relief, an ancient inscription, a coin, or such\r\n     matters. Each Hebrew Winckelmann in the Ghetto lays out his rags\r\n     for sale with a certain pride, as does the dealer in marble\r\n     fragments. The latter boasts a piece of giallo-antico, the Jew can\r\n     match it with an excellent fragment of yellow silk; porphyry here\r\n     is represented by a piece of dark red damask, verde-antico by a\r\n     handsome patch of ancient green velvet. And there is neither jasper\r\n     nor alabaster, black marble, or white, or parti-coloured, which the\r\n     Ghetto antiquarian is not able to match. The history of every\r\n     fashion from Herod the Great to the invention of paletôts, and of\r\n     every mode of the highest as well as of the lower classes may be\r\n     collected from these fragments, some of which are really\r\n     historical, and may once have adorned the persons of Romulus,\r\n     Scipio Africanus, Hannibal, Cornelia, Augustus, Charlemagne,\r\n     Pericles, Cleopatra, Barbarossa, Gregory VII., Columbus, and so\r\n     forth.\r\n\r\n     \"Here sit the daughters of Zion on these heaps and sew all that is\r\n     capable of being sewn. Great is their boasted skill in all work of\r\n     mending, darning, and fine-drawing, and it is said that even the\r\n     most formidable rent in any old drapery or garment whatsoever,\r\n     becomes invisible under the hands of these Arachnes. It is chiefly\r\n     in the Fiumara, the street lying lowest and nearest to the river,\r\n     and in the street corners (one of which is called Argumille, _i.e._\r\n     of unleavened bread), that this business is carried on. I have\r\n     often seen with a feeling of pain the pale, stooping, starving\r\n     figures, laboriously plying the needle,--men as well as women,\r\n     girls, and children. Misery stares forth from the tangled hair, and\r\n     complains silently in the yellow-brown faces, and no beauty of\r\n     feature recalls the countenance of Rachel, Leah, or Miriam,--only\r\n     sometimes a glance from a deep-sunk, piercing black eye, that looks\r\n     up from its needle and rags, and seems to say--'From the daughter\r\n     of Zion, all her beauty is departed--she that was great among the\r\n     nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become\r\n     tributary! She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her\r\n     cheeks; among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her\r\n     friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her\r\n     enemies. Judah is gone into captivity, because of affliction, and\r\n     because of great servitude; she dwelleth among the heathen, she\r\n     findeth no rest; all her persecutors overtook her between the\r\n     straits. How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a\r\n     cloud in his anger!\"--_Gregorovius, Wanderjahre._\r\n\r\nThe narrow street which is a continuation of the Pescheria, emerges upon\r\nthe small square called _Piazza della Giudecca_. In the houses on the\r\nleft may be seen some columns and part of an architrave, being the only\r\nvisible remains of the _Theatre of Balbus_, erected by C. Cornelius\r\nBalbus, a general who triumphed in the time of Augustus, with the spoils\r\ntaken from the Garamantes, a people of Africa. It was opened in the same\r\nyear as the Theatre of Marcellus, and though very much smaller, was\r\ncapable of containing as many as 11,600 spectators.\r\n\r\nTo the right, still partly on the site of the ancient theatre, and\r\nextending along one side of the Piazza delle Scuole, is the vast\r\n_Palazzo Cenci_, the ancient residence of the famous Cenci family (now\r\nrepresented by Count Cenci-Bolognetti), and the scene of many of the\r\nterrible crimes and tragedies which stain its annals.\r\n\r\n     \"The Cenci Palace is of great extent: and, though in part\r\n     modernized, there yet remains a vast and gloomy pile of feudal\r\n     architecture in the same state as during the dreadful scenes which\r\n     it once witnessed. The palace is situated in an obscure corner of\r\n     Rome, near the quarter of the Jews, and from the upper windows you\r\n     see the immense ruins of Mount Palatine, half hidden under the\r\n     profuse undergrowth of trees. There is a court in one part of the\r\n     palace supported by columns, and adorned with antique friezes of\r\n     fine workmanship, and built up, after the Italian fashion, with\r\n     balcony over balcony of open work. One of the gates of the palace,\r\n     formed of immense stones, and leading through a passage dark and\r\n     lofty, and opening into gloomy subterranean chambers, struck me\r\n     particularly.\"--_Shelley's Preface to \"The Cenci.\"_\r\n\r\nOpposite the further entrance of the Palace, is the tiny Church of _S.\r\nTommaso del Cenci_, founded 1113 by Cencio, bishop of Sabina; granted by\r\nJulius II. to Rocco Cenci;--and rebuilt in 1575 by the wicked Count\r\nCenci.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1585, Francesco Cenci was the head of the family, a man of\r\n     passions so ungovernable and heart so depraved, that he hesitated\r\n     at no species of crime. His first wife was a Princess Santa Croce,\r\n     whom he is believed to have poisoned in order to marry the\r\n     beautiful Lucrezia Petroni. His domestic cruelties to his children,\r\n     especially to his three elder sons, Giacomo, Christoforo, and\r\n     Rocco, were so terrible, that they petitioned the reigning Pope\r\n     Clement VIII. to interfere in their behalf, but he abruptly\r\n     dismissed them as rebels against the paternal authority; one\r\n     daughter, Marguerita, alone escaped from her miserable home, being\r\n     given in marriage by the pope to a Signor Gabrielli.\r\n\r\n     \"The escape of this daughter made Francesco the more embittered\r\n     against the remainder of his family. His youngest child, Beatrice,\r\n     he immured in a solitary chamber, to which no one but himself was\r\n     admitted, and where he constantly starved and beat her severely.\r\n     When he received the news that his sons Christoforo and Rocco were\r\n     assassinated in the neighbourhood of Rome by an unknown hand, he\r\n     expressed the utmost joy, declaring that no money of his should\r\n     purchase masses for the repose of their souls, and that he could\r\n     have no peace until his wife and every child he had were in their\r\n     graves.\r\n\r\n     \"Lucrezia, believing that the monster whom she had espoused was\r\n     possessed, in spite of his cruelty, by a criminal passion for his\r\n     own daughter, attempted secretly to save her, by presenting a\r\n     memorial to the pope imploring him to give her in marriage to a\r\n     Signor Guerra, who had long been attached to her. But this petition\r\n     was intercepted by Francesco, who then carried off Lucrezia and his\r\n     two youngest children, Beatrice and Bernardo, to Petrella, a vast\r\n     and desolate castle in the Apennines. Guerra, and Giacomo the\r\n     eldest remaining brother of Beatrice, hired a band of banditti in\r\n     the Sabine hills who were to attack the party on the way, and to\r\n     carry off Francesco for a ransom, liberating the women;--but the\r\n     rescue arrived too late.\r\n\r\n     \"When they reached Petrella, Beatrice was incarcerated in a\r\n     subterranean dungeon, where she was persuaded that her lover Guerra\r\n     had been murdered, and was treated with such awful cruelty by her\r\n     father, that, for a time, she was deprived of her reason. One day a\r\n     servant, Marzio, whose betrothed had previously been seduced and\r\n     murdered by Francesco, roused by the shrieks of Beatrice, burst\r\n     into the room, and rushing upon his master dealt a terrible thrust\r\n     with a dagger on his neck, exclaiming, 'I murder thee, assassin of\r\n     thy own blood.' But Cenci arose uninjured, to the horror of Marzio,\r\n     who imagined that only a demon could avert such a blow, and who was\r\n     ignorant that he wore under his vestments, even in bed, a coat of\r\n     mail which covered his entire body.\r\n\r\n     \"At length Beatrice contrived to communicate with her brother\r\n     Giacomo, who united with Guerra in hiring the services of Marzio\r\n     and of Olympio, another servant, who was inspired with an equal\r\n     thirst for vengeance upon Count Cenci. All felt that the death of\r\n     Francesco was the only hope for his unhappy family. The assassins\r\n     communicated with Lucrezia, who administered an opiate to her\r\n     husband, and then stole from him some keys which enabled her after\r\n     midnight to liberate Bernardo and Beatrice. The latter she found in\r\n     a state of stupefaction, and vainly endeavoured to rouse her,\r\n     signifying that the moment of escape had arrived. Beatrice showed\r\n     no symptom of surprise at the announcement, or at the visit of her\r\n     stepmother at that strange hour; she asked not how they had opened\r\n     her door, or how her liberty had been acquired. When they were all\r\n     assembled in the hall, Lucrezia told them the project, and asked\r\n     their aid. Bernardo at first hesitated, but Lucrezia roused him by\r\n     every argument she could urge and obtained his consent. Beatrice\r\n     made no reply.\r\n\r\n     \" ... Francesco Cenci was murdered in his sleep. Marzio placed a\r\n     large nail or iron bolt on his right eye, which Olympio, with one\r\n     blow of a hammer, drove straight into the brain. The deed thus\r\n     accomplished, Marzio and Olympio wrapped the dead body in a sheet,\r\n     and carried it to a small pavilion built at the end of a\r\n     terrace-walk, overlooking an orchard. From this height they cast it\r\n     down on an old gnarled elder-tree, in order that when the body\r\n     should be found the next morning, it might appear that whilst\r\n     walking on the terrace, the foot of the count had slipped, and that\r\n     he had fallen head-foremost on one of the stunted branches of the\r\n     tree, which, piercing through his eye to the brain, had caused his\r\n     death. Returning to the hall, they received from Lucrezia a purse\r\n     of gold; Marzio, carrying with him a valuable cloak trimmed with\r\n     gold lace, turned towards Beatrice (who still stood leaning against\r\n     the table), and saying, 'I shall keep this as a memorial of you,'\r\n     departed with Olympio. The report of Francesco's death was not\r\n     spread through the castle until the next morning. Lucrezia then\r\n     rushed through the house uttering cries. In a day or two the\r\n     funeral took place, and immediately after the family returned to\r\n     Rome. Giacomo took possession of the Cenci palace, and Beatrice\r\n     daily improved in health of body and mind.\r\n\r\n     \"Soon, however, the suspicious circumstances of Count Cenci's\r\n     death excited attention; the body was exhumed and examined, and\r\n     the inhabitants of Petrella placed under arrest, when a washerwoman\r\n     deposed to having received bloody sheets from one of the\r\n     inhabitants of the castle--she thought from Beatrice--the day after\r\n     the murder. On hearing this, the fear that he would turn against\r\n     them, induced Signor Guerra to hire assassins to pursue Olympio,\r\n     whom they despatched at Terni; but Marzio was arrested, and\r\n     confessed the circumstances of the murder, though when confronted\r\n     with Beatrice, he proclaimed her innocence of it, and declared her\r\n     incapable of crime.\r\n\r\n     \"Guerra made good his escape, but the whole Cenci family were\r\n     thrown into prison and put to the torture. Giacomo, Bernardo, and\r\n     Lucrezia, unable to endure the sufferings of the rack, confessed at\r\n     once.\r\n\r\n     \"Such, however, was not the case with the young and beautiful\r\n     Beatrice. Full of spirit and courage, neither the persuasions nor\r\n     threats of Moscati the judge could extort from her the smallest\r\n     confession. She endured the torture of the cord with all the\r\n     firmness which the purity of her heart inspired. The judge failed\r\n     to extort from her lips a single word which could throw a shade\r\n     over her innocence, and at length, believing it useless to pursue\r\n     the torture further, he suspended the proceedings, and reported\r\n     them to the pope. But Clement VIII, suspecting that the\r\n     unwillingness of Moscati to believe Beatrice guilty was induced by\r\n     her extreme beauty, only replied by consigning the prosecution to\r\n     another judge, and Beatrice was left in the hands of Luciani, 'a\r\n     man whose heart was a stranger to every feeling of humanity.' Upon\r\n     her renewed protestations of innocence, he ordered the torture of\r\n     the Vigilia.\r\n\r\n     \"The torture of the Vigilia was as follows:--Upon a high\r\n     joint-stool, the seat about a span large, and instead of being\r\n     flat, cut in the form of pointed diamonds, the victim was seated:\r\n     the legs were fastened together and without support; the hands\r\n     bound behind the back, and with a running knot attached to a cord\r\n     descending from the ceiling: the body was loosely attached to the\r\n     back of the chair, cut also into angular points. A wretch stood\r\n     near, pushing the victim from side to side, and now and then, by\r\n     pulling the rope from the ceiling, gave the arms most painful\r\n     jerks. In this horrible position the sufferer _remained forty\r\n     hours_, the assistants being changed every fifth hour. At the\r\n     expiration of this time, Beatrice was carried into the prison more\r\n     dead than alive. The judge was annoyed at the account he received\r\n     of the fortitude of Beatrice, and, in a rage, he exclaimed, 'Never\r\n     shall it be said that a weak girl can escape from my hands, while\r\n     not one of those condemned have been able to resist my power!'\r\n\r\n     \"On the third day the examination was renewed, and Beatrice was\r\n     condemned to the _tortura capillorum_. 'At a given signal, the\r\n     satellites of the tribunal carried Beatrice under a rope suspended\r\n     from the ceiling, and twisting into a cord her long and beautiful\r\n     hair, they attached it, with diabolical art, to the rope, so that\r\n     the whole body could by this means be raised from the ground. The\r\n     frightful preparations over, and her protestations of innocence\r\n     again disregarded, she was elevated from the ground by the hair of\r\n     her head; at the same time was added another torture, consisting of\r\n     a mesh of small cords twined about the fingers, twisting them\r\n     nearly out of joint and dragging the hand almost from the bone of\r\n     the arm. The wretched girl screamed with agony, while the judge\r\n     stood by, commanding the suspended rope to be tightened, and\r\n     raising the body by the hair from the ground gave it a sudden jerk,\r\n     exhorting her to confess. She cried out in a convulsion for water,\r\n     rolling her eyes in agony, and exclaiming, 'I am innocent.' The\r\n     torture being repeated with still greater cruelty, and the\r\n     fortitude of the young girl remaining unshaken, the judge,\r\n     believing it impossible that a young female could resist such\r\n     torments, concluded, with the superstition of the times, that she\r\n     carried about with her some witchcraft; he ordered her to be\r\n     examined, and finding no cause of suspicion, was about to have her\r\n     hair cut off, when it was suggested the torment of the _tortura\r\n     capillorum_ could not then be renewed; her hair was again fastened\r\n     to the rope, and for a whole hour she was subjected to such a\r\n     succession of cruelties as the heart shrinks from narrating: but\r\n     not a word escaped from her lips, that could compromise her\r\n     innocence.\r\n\r\n     \"In the mean time Lucrezia, Giacomo, and Bernardo were taken into\r\n     the hall Erculeo, and in their presence a repetition of the torture\r\n     was ordered, to so awful an extent, that she fainted and lay\r\n     senseless. A new cruelty was devised--the _taxilla_,--her feet were\r\n     bared, and to the soles was applied a block of heated wood,\r\n     prepared in such a way as to retain the scorching heat; then did\r\n     the unhappy girl utter piercing shrieks, and remained some minutes\r\n     apparently dead. These accumulated tortures were repeated, until\r\n     her relations, who were handcuffed lest they should render her any\r\n     assistance, began to implore her with heart-rending tears and\r\n     entreaties to yield. To this the judge mingled threats and the\r\n     application of further torments, and enforced them with such\r\n     rigour, that the victim shrieked in agony, and exclaimed, 'Oh!\r\n     cease this martyrdom, and I will confess anything.'\r\n\r\n     \"The tortures were at once suspended and restoratives applied,\r\n     while her family on their knees implored Beatrice to adhere to her\r\n     promise, urging that the unnatural cruelties of her father would be\r\n     a just defence for the crime imputed to her, and that by agreeing\r\n     to their deposition, she might give them a hope of common\r\n     liberation. The unhappy girl replied, 'Be it as you wish. I am\r\n     content to die if I can preserve you'--and to each interrogatory of\r\n     the judge she replied, '_E vero_,' until asked whether she did not\r\n     urge the assassins to kill her father, and, on their refusal,\r\n     propose to commit the crime herself, when she involuntarily\r\n     exclaimed, 'Impossible, impossible! a tiger could not do it; how\r\n     much less a daughter!' Threatened anew with the torture, she\r\n     answered not, but, raising her eyes to Heaven, and moving her lips\r\n     in prayer, she said, 'Oh my God, Thou knowest if this be true!'\r\n     Thus did the judge force from Beatrice an assent to a deed at which\r\n     her very nature revolted.\r\n\r\n     \"Luciani hastened to the pope with the news that Beatrice had\r\n     confessed. Clement VIII. was seized with one of those fits of anger\r\n     to which he was subject, and exclaimed--'Let them all be\r\n     immediately bound to the tails of wild horses, and dragged through\r\n     the streets until life is extinct.' The horror evinced by all\r\n     classes at this sentence induced him to grant a respite of\r\n     twenty-five days, at the end of which a trial took place, and the\r\n     advocate Farinacci boldly pleaded the defence of the prisoners. But\r\n     while their fate was hanging in the balance, the Marchesa\r\n     Santa-Croce was murdered by her own son, which caused Clement to\r\n     order the immediate execution of the whole Cenci family, and the\r\n     entreaties of their friends only induced him to spare the life of\r\n     Bernardo, with the horrible proviso that he was to remain upon the\r\n     scaffold and witness the execution of his relations.\r\n\r\n     \" ... During the fearful and protracted transit to the scaffold, it\r\n     was the custom of the satellites of the inquisition, at regular\r\n     intervals, to tear from the body pieces of flesh with heated\r\n     pincers, but in this instance the pope dispensed with this torture,\r\n     but ordered that Giacomo should be beaten to death and then\r\n     quartered. As the procession passed the piazza of the Palazzo\r\n     Cenci, Giacomo, who had appeared resigned, became dreadfully\r\n     agitated, and uttered heart-rending cries of, 'My children! my\r\n     children!' The people shouted, 'Dogs, give him his children!' The\r\n     procession was proceeding, when the multitude assumed such a\r\n     threatening aspect, that two of the Compagnia dei Confortati\r\n     thought themselves authorised to pause, the unhappy man imploring\r\n     them in accents of despair, to suffer him once more to behold his\r\n     children. The crowd became pacified on seeing Giacomo descend from\r\n     the cart and conducted to the vestibule of his palace, where they\r\n     brought to him his children and his wife. The latter fainted on the\r\n     last step.\r\n\r\n     \"The scene that followed was the most affecting and painful that\r\n     the imagination can picture. His three children clung around his\r\n     legs, uttering cries that rent the hearts of all present The\r\n     unhappy man embraced them, telling them that in Bernardo they would\r\n     find a father; then, fixing his eyes on his unconscious wife, he\r\n     said, 'Let us go!' Reascending the cart, the procession stopped\r\n     before the prison of the Corte Savella.\r\n\r\n     \"Here Beatrice and Lucrezia appeared before the gates, conducted by\r\n     the Confortati. They knelt down and prayed for some time before the\r\n     crucifix, and then walked on foot behind the carriage. Lucrezia\r\n     wore a robe of black, and a long black veil covered her head and\r\n     shoulders; Beatrice in a dark robe and veil, a handkerchief of\r\n     cloth of silver on her head, and slippers of white velvet,\r\n     ornamented with crimson sandals and rosettes, followed.... Twice\r\n     during the passage, an attempt was made to rescue Beatrice, but\r\n     each failed, and she reached the chapel, where all the condemned\r\n     were to receive the blessing of the Sacrament before execution.\r\n\r\n     \"The first brought out to ascend the scaffold was Bernardo, who,\r\n     according to the conditions of his reprieve, was to witness the\r\n     death of his relatives. The poor boy, before he had reached the\r\n     summit, fell down in a swoon, and was obliged to be supported to\r\n     his seat of torture. Preceded by the standard and the brethren of\r\n     the Misericordia, the executioner next entered the chapel to convey\r\n     Lucrezia. Binding her hands behind her back, and removing the veil\r\n     that covered her head and shoulders, he led her to the foot of the\r\n     scaffold. Here she stopped, prayed devoutly, kissed the crucifix,\r\n     and taking off her shoes, mounted the ladder barefoot. From\r\n     confusion and terror, she with difficulty ascended, crying out,\r\n     'Oh, my God! oh, holy brethren, pray for my soul, oh, God, pardon\r\n     me!' The principal executioner beckoned to her to place herself on\r\n     the block; the unhappy woman, from her unwieldy figure, being\r\n     unable to do so, some violence was used, the executioner raised his\r\n     axe, and with one stroke severed the head from the body! Catching\r\n     it by the hair, he exposed it, still quivering, to the gaze of the\r\n     populace; then wrapping it in the veil, he laid it on a bier in the\r\n     corner of the scaffold, the body falling into a coffin placed\r\n     underneath. The violence used towards the sufferer had so excited\r\n     the multitude, that a universal uproar commenced. Forty young men\r\n     rushed forward to the chapel to rescue Beatrice, but were again\r\n     defeated, after a short struggle....\r\n\r\n     \"Meanwhile Beatrice, kneeling in the chapel absorbed in prayer,\r\n     heeded not the uproar that surrounded her. She rose, as the\r\n     standard appeared to precede her to the block, and with eagerness\r\n     demanded, 'Is my mother then really dead?'--Answered in the\r\n     affirmative, she prayed with fervour; then raising her voice, she\r\n     said, 'Lord, thou hast called me, and I obey the summons\r\n     willingly, as I hope for mercy!' Approaching her brother, she bade\r\n     him farewell, and with a smile of love, said, 'Grieve not for me.\r\n     We shall be happy in heaven, I have forgiven thee.' Giacomo\r\n     fainted; his sister, turning round, said, 'Let us proceed!' The\r\n     executioner appeared with a cord, but seemed afraid to fasten it\r\n     round her body. She saw this, and with a sad smile said, 'Bind this\r\n     body; but hasten to release the soul, which pants for immortality!'\r\n\r\n     \"Scarcely had the victim arrived at the foot of the scaffold, when\r\n     the square, filled with that vast multitude before so uproarious,\r\n     suddenly assumed the silence of a desert. Each one bent forward to\r\n     hear her speak; with every eye riveted on her, and lips apart, it\r\n     seemed as if their very existence depended on any words she might\r\n     utter. Beatrice ascended the stairs with a slow but firm step. In a\r\n     moment she placed herself on the block, which had caused so much\r\n     fear to Lucrezia. She did not allow the executioner to remove the\r\n     veil, but laid it herself upon the table. In this dreadful\r\n     situation she remained a few minutes, a universal cry of horror\r\n     staying the arm of the executioner. But soon the head of his victim\r\n     was held up separated from the trunk, which was violently agitated\r\n     for a few seconds. The miserable Bernardo Cenci, forced to witness\r\n     the fate of his sister, again swooned away; nor could he be\r\n     restored to his senses for more than half an hour.\r\n\r\n     \"Meanwhile the scaffold was made ready for the dreadful punishment\r\n     destined for Giacomo. Having performed some religious ceremonies,\r\n     he appeared dressed in a cloak and cap. Turning towards the people,\r\n     he said in a clear voice, 'Although in the agonies of torture I\r\n     accused my sister and brother of sharing in the crime for which I\r\n     suffer, I accused them falsely. Now that I am about to render an\r\n     account of my actions to God, I solemnly assert their entire\r\n     innocence. Farewell, my friends. Oh, pray to God for me.'\r\n\r\n     \"Saying these words, he knelt down; the executioner bound his legs\r\n     to the block and bandaged his eyes. To particularise the details of\r\n     this execution would be too dreadful; suffice it to say, he was\r\n     beaten, beheaded, and quartered in the sight of that vast\r\n     multitude, and by the side of a brother, who was sprinkled with his\r\n     blood. All was now over.\r\n\r\n     \"..... Near the statue of St. Paul, according to custom, were\r\n     placed three biers, each with four lighted torches. In these were\r\n     laid the bodies of the victims. A crown of flowers had been placed\r\n     around the head of Beatrice, who seemed as though in sleep, so\r\n     calm, so peaceful was that placid face, while a smile such as she\r\n     wore in life still hovered on her lips. Many a tear was shed over\r\n     that bier, many a flower was scattered around her, whose fate all\r\n     mourned--whose innocence none questioned.\r\n\r\n     \"On that night the bodies were interred. The corpse of Beatrice,\r\n     clad in the dress she wore on the scaffold, was borne, covered with\r\n     garlands of flowers, to the church of San Pietro in Montorio; and\r\n     buried at the foot of the high altar, before Raffaelle's celebrated\r\n     picture of the Transfiguration.\"[97]\r\n\r\nRetracing our steps to the Piazza della Giudecca and turning left down a\r\nnarrow alley, which is always busy with Jewish traffic, we reach the\r\n_Piazza delle Tartarughe_, so called from the tortoises which form part\r\nof the adornments of its lovely little fountain,--designed by Giacomo\r\ndella Porta, the four figures of boys being by Taddeo Landini.\r\n\r\nAt this point we leave the Ghetto.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nForming one side of the Piazza delle Tartarughe is the _Palazzo\r\nCostaguti_, celebrated for its six splendid ceilings by great artists,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n    1. _Albani_: Hercules wounding the Centaur Nessus.\r\n    2. _Domenichino_: Apollo in his car, Time discovering truth,\r\n        &c., much injured.\r\n    3. _Guercino_: _Rinaldo_ and _Armida_ in a chariot drawn by dragons.\r\n    4. _Cav. d'Arpino_: Juno nursing Hercules, Venus and Cupids.\r\n    5. _Lanfranco_: Justice and Peace.\r\n    6. _Romanelli_: Arion saved by the dolphin.\r\n\r\nIn a corner of the piazza, is a well-known _Lace-Shop_, much frequented\r\nby English ladies, but great powers of bargaining are called for. Almost\r\nimmediately behind this is one of the most picturesque mediæval\r\ncourtyards in the city.\r\n\r\nOn the same line, at the end of the street, is the _Palazzo Mattei_,\r\nbuilt by Carlo Maderno (1615) for Duke Asdrubal Mattei, on the site of\r\nthe Circus of Flaminius. The small courtyard of this palace is well\r\nworth examining, and is one of the handsomest in Rome, being quite\r\nencrusted, as well as the staircase, with ancient bas-reliefs, busts,\r\nand other sculptures. It contained a gallery of pictures, the greater\r\npart of which have been dispersed. The rooms have frescoes by\r\n_Pomerancio_, _Lanfranco_, _Pietro da Cortona_, _Domenichino_, and\r\n_Albani_.\r\n\r\nBehind this, facing the Via delle Botteghe Oscure, is the vast _Palazzo\r\nCaëtani_, now inhabited by the learned Don Michael-Angelo Caëtani (Duke\r\nof Sermoneta and Prince of Teano), whose family is one of the most\r\ndistinguished in the mediæval history of Rome, and which gave Boniface\r\nVIII. to the church:\r\n\r\n    \"Lo principe de' nuovi farisei.\"\r\n\r\n    _Dante, Inferno,_ xxvii.\r\n\r\nIt claims descent from Anatolius, created Count of Gaieta by Pope\r\nGregory II. in 730.\r\n\r\nClose to the Palazzo Mattei is the _Church of Sta. Caterina de' Funari_,\r\nbuilt by Giacomo della Porta, in 1563, adjoining a convent of\r\nAugustinian nuns. The streets in this quarter are interesting as bearing\r\nwitness in their names to the existence of the Circus Flaminius, the\r\nespecial circus of the plebs, which once occupied all the ground near\r\nthis. The _Via delle Botteghe Oscure_, commemorates the dark shops which\r\nin mediæval times occupied the lower part of the circus, as they do now\r\nthat of the Theatre of Marcellus. The Via dei Funari, the ropemakers who\r\ntook advantage for their work of the light and open space which the\r\ninterior of the deserted circus afforded. The remains of the circus\r\nexisted to the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nNear this, turning right, is the _Piazza di Campitelli_, which contains\r\nthe _Church of S. Maria in Campitelli_, built by Rinaldi for Alexander\r\nVII. in 1659, upon the site of an oratory erected by Sta. Galla in the\r\ntime of John I. (523-6), in honour of an image of the Virgin, which one\r\nday miraculously appeared imploring her charity, in company with the\r\ntwelve poor women to whom she was daily in the habit of giving alms. The\r\noratory of Sta. Galla was called Sta. Maria in Portico, from the\r\nneighbouring portico of Octavia, a name which is sometimes applied to\r\nthe present church. The miraculous mendicant image is now enshrined in\r\ngold and lapis-lazuli over the high altar. Other relics supposed to be\r\npreserved here are the bodies of Sta. Cyrica, Sta. Victoria, and Sta.\r\nVincenza, and half that of Sta. Barbara! The second chapel on the right\r\nhas a picture of the Descent of the Holy Ghost by _Luca Giordano_; in\r\nthe first chapel on the left is the tomb of Prince Altieri, inscribed\r\n\"Umbra,\" and that of his wife, Donna Laura di Carpegna, inscribed\r\n\"Nihil;\" they rest on lions of rosso-antico. In the right transept is\r\nthe tomb, by _Pettrich_, of Cardinal Pacca, who lived in the Palazzo\r\nPacca, on the opposite side of the square, and was the faithful friend\r\nof Pius VII. in his exile. The bas-relief on the tomb, of St. Peter\r\ndelivered by the angel, is in allusion to the deliverance from the\r\nFrench captivity.\r\n\r\nThe name Campitelli is probably derived from Campusteli, because in this\r\nneighbourhood (see Ch. XIV.) was the Columna Bellica, from which when\r\nwar was declared a dart was thrown into a plot of ground, representing\r\nthe hostile territory,--perhaps the very site of this church.\r\n\r\nIn the street behind this, leading into the Via di Ara Cœli, are the\r\nremains of the ancient _Palazzo Margana_, with a very richly-sculptured\r\ngateway of _c._ 1350.\r\n\r\nOpening from hence upon the left is the _Via Tor de' Specchi_, whose\r\nname commemorates the legend of Virgil as a necromancer, and of his\r\nmagic tower lined with mirrors, in which all the secrets of the city\r\nwere reflected and brought to light.\r\n\r\nHere is the famous _Convent of the Tor de' Specchi_, founded by Sta.\r\nFrancesca Romana, and open to the public during the octave of the\r\nanniversary of her death (following the 9th of March). At this time the\r\npavements are strewn with box, the halls and galleries are bright with\r\nfresh flowers, and Swiss guards are posted at the different turnings, to\r\nfacilitate the circulation of visitors. It is a beautiful specimen of a\r\nRoman convent. The first hall is painted with ancient frescoes,\r\nrepresenting scenes in the life of the saint. Here, on a table, is the\r\nlarge bowl in which Sta. Francesca prepared ointment for the poor. Other\r\nrelics are her veil, shoes, &c. Passing a number of open cloisters,\r\ncheerful with flowers and orange-trees, we reach the chapel, where\r\nsermons or rather lectures are delivered at the anniversary upon the\r\nstory of Sta. Francesca's life, and where her embalmed body may be seen\r\nbeneath the altar. A staircase seldom seen, but especially used by\r\nFrancesca, is only ascended by the nuns upon their knees. It leads to\r\nher cell and a small chapel, black with age, and preserved as when she\r\nused them. The picturesque dress of the Oblate sisters who are\r\neverywhere visible, adds to the interest of the scene.\r\n\r\n     \"It is no gloomy abode, the Convent of the Tor di Specchi, even in\r\n     the eyes of those who cannot understand the happiness of a nun. It\r\n     is such a place as one loves to see children in; where religion is\r\n     combined with everything that pleases the eye and recreates the\r\n     mind. The beautiful chapel; the garden with its magnificent\r\n     orange-trees; the open galleries, with their fanciful decorations\r\n     and scenic recesses, where a holy picture or figure takes you by\r\n     surprise, and meets you at every turn; the light airy rooms, where\r\n     religious prints and ornaments, with flowers, birds, and ingenious\r\n     toys, testify that innocent enjoyments are encouraged and smiled\r\n     upon; while from every window may be caught a glimpse of the\r\n     Eternal City, a spire, a ruined wall,--something that speaks of\r\n     Rome and its thousand charms.\r\n\r\n     \"It was on the 21st of March, the festival of St. Benedict, that\r\n     Francesca herself entered the convent, not as the foundress, but as\r\n     a humble suppliant for admission. At the foot of the stairs, having\r\n     taken off her customary black gown, her veil, and her shoes, and\r\n     placed a cord around her neck, she knelt down, kissed the ground,\r\n     and, shedding an abundance of tears, made her general confession\r\n     aloud in the presence of all the Oblates; she described herself as\r\n     a miserable sinner, a grievous offender against God, and asked\r\n     permission to dwell amongst them as the meanest of their servants;\r\n     and to learn from them to amend her life, and enter upon a holier\r\n     course. The spiritual daughters of Francesca hastened to raise and\r\n     embrace her; and clothing her with their habit, they led the way to\r\n     the chapel, where they all returned thanks to God. While she\r\n     remained there in prayer, Agnese de Lellis, the superioress,\r\n     assembled the sisters in the chapter-room, and declared to them,\r\n     that now their true mother and foundress had come amongst them, it\r\n     would be absurd for her to remain in her present office; that\r\n     Francesca was their guide, their head, and that into her hands she\r\n     should instantly resign her authority. They all applauded her\r\n     decision, and gathering around the Saint, announced to her their\r\n     wishes. As was to be expected, Francesca strenuously refused to\r\n     accede to this proposal, and pleaded her inability for the duties\r\n     of a superioress. The Oblates had recourse to Don Giovanni, the\r\n     confessor of Francesca, who began by entreating, and finally\r\n     commanded her acceptance of the charge. His order she never\r\n     resisted; and accordingly, on the 25th of March, she was duly\r\n     elected to that office.\"--_Lady Georgina Fullerton's Life of Sta.\r\n     Francesca Romana._\r\n\r\n     \"Sta. Francesca Romana is represented in the dress of a Benedictine\r\n     nun, a black robe and a white hood or veil; and her proper\r\n     attribute is an angel, who holds in his hand the book of the Office\r\n     of the Virgin, open at the words, '_Tenuisti manum dexteram meam,\r\n     et in voluntate tua deduxisti me, et cum gloria suscepisti me_'\r\n     (Ps. lxxiii. 23, 24); which attribute is derived from an incident\r\n     thus narrated in the acts of her canonisation. Though unwearied in\r\n     her devotions, yet if, during her prayers, she was called away by\r\n     her husband on any domestic duty, she would close her book, saying\r\n     that 'a wife and a mother, when called upon, must quit her God at\r\n     the altar, and find him in her household affairs.' Now it happened\r\n     once, that, in reciting the Office of Our Lady, she was called away\r\n     four times just as she was beginning the same verse, and, returning\r\n     the fifth time, she found that verse written upon the page in\r\n     letters of golden light by the hand of her guardian\r\n     angel.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 151.\r\n\r\nAlmost opposite the convent is the Via del Monte Tarpeio, a narrow\r\nalley, leading up to the foot of the Tarpeian rock, beneath the Palazzo\r\nCaffarelli, and one of the points at which the rock is best seen. This\r\nspot is believed to have been the site of the house of Spurius Mælius,\r\nwho tried to ingratiate himself with the people, by buying up corn and\r\ndistributing it in a year of scarcity (B.C. 440), but who was in\r\nconsequence put to death by the patricians. His house was razed to the\r\nground, and its site, being always kept vacant, went by the name of\r\nÆquimælium.[98]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PALATINE.\r\n\r\n     The Story of the Hill--Orti Farnesiani--The Via Nova--Roma\r\n     Quadrata--The Houses of the early Kings--Temple of Jupiter\r\n     Stator--Palace of Augustus--Palace of\r\n     Vespasian--Crypto-Porticus--Temple of Jupiter-Victor--The Lupercal\r\n     and the Hut of Faustulus--Palace of Tiberius--Palace of\r\n     Caligula--Clivus Victoriæ--Ruins of the Kingly Period--Altar of the\r\n     Genius Loci--House of Hortensius--Septizonium of Severus--Palace of\r\n     Domitian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Palatine formed a trapezium of solid rock, two sides of which were\r\nabout 300 yards in length, the others about 400: the area of its summit,\r\nto compare it with a familiar object, was nearly equal to the space\r\nbetween Pall-Mall and Piccadilly in London.\"[99]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Palatine is the history of the City of Rome. Here was\r\nthe Roma Quadrata, the \"oppidum,\" or fortress of the Pelasgi, of which\r\nthe only remaining trace is the name Roma, signifying force. This is the\r\nfortress where the shepherd-king Evander is represented by Virgil as\r\nwelcoming Æneas.\r\n\r\nThe Pelasgic fortress was enclosed by Romulus within the limits of this\r\nnew city, which, \"after the Etruscan fashion, he traced round the foot\r\nof the hill with a plough drawn by a bull and a heifer, the furrow being\r\ncarefully made to fall inwards, and the heifer yoked to the near-side,\r\nto signify that strength and courage were required without, obedience\r\nand fertility within the city.... The locality thus enclosed was\r\nreserved for the temples of the gods and the residence of the ruling\r\nclass, the class of patricians or burghers, as Niebuhr has taught us to\r\nentitle them, which predominated over the dependent commons, and only\r\nsuffered them to crouch for security under the walls of Romulus. The\r\nPalatine was never occupied by the plebs. In the last age of the\r\nrepublic, long after the removal of this partition, or of the civil\r\ndistinction between the great classes of the state, here was still the\r\nchosen site of the mansions of the highest nobility.\"[100]\r\n\r\nIn the time of the early kings the City of Rome was represented by the\r\nPalatine only. It was at first divided into two parts, one inhabited,\r\nand the other called Velia, and left for the grazing of cattle. It had\r\ntwo gates, the Porta Romana to the north, and the Porta Mugonia--so\r\ncalled from the lowing of the cattle--to the south, on the side of the\r\nVelia.\r\n\r\nAugustus was born on the Palatine, and dwelt there in common with other\r\npatrician citizens in his youth. After he became emperor he still lived\r\nthere, but simply, and in the house of Hortensius, till, on its\r\ndestruction by fire, the people of Rome insisted upon building him a\r\npalace more worthy of their ruler. This building was the\r\nfoundation-stone of \"the Palace of the Cæsars,\" which in time overran\r\nthe whole hill, and, under Nero, two of the neighbouring hills besides,\r\nand whose ruins are daily being disinterred and recognised, though much\r\nconfusion still remains regarding their respective sites. In A.D. 663,\r\npart of the palace remained sufficiently perfect to be inhabited by the\r\nEmperor Constans, and its plan is believed to have been entire for a\r\ncentury after, but it never really recovered its sack by Genseric in\r\nA.D. 455, in which it was completely gutted, even of the commonest\r\nfurniture; and as years passed on it became imbedded in the soil which\r\nhas so marvellously enshrouded all the ancient buildings of Rome, so\r\nthat till within the last ten years, only a few broken nameless walls\r\nwere visible above ground.\r\n\r\n    \"Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower grown\r\n    Matted and mass'd together, hillocks heap'd\r\n    On what were chambers, arch crush'd, columns strown\r\n    In fragments, choked-up vaults, and frescoes steep'd\r\n    In subterranean damps, where the owl peep'd,\r\n    Deeming it midnight:--Temples, baths, or halls?\r\n    Pronounce who can; for all that Learning reap'd\r\n    From her research has been, that these are walls.--\r\n    Behold the Imperial Mount! 'Tis thus the mighty falls.\"\r\n\r\n    _Byron, Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nHow different is this description to that of Claudian (de Sexto\r\nConsulat. Honorii).\r\n\r\n    \"The Palatine, proud Rome's imperial seat,\r\n    (An awful pile) stands venerably great:\r\n    Thither the kingdoms and the nations come,\r\n    In supplicating crowds to learn their doom:\r\n    To Delphi less th' inquiring worlds repair,\r\n    Nor does a greater god inhabit there:\r\n    This sure the pompous mansion was design'd\r\n    To please the mighty rulers of mankind;\r\n    Inferior temples rise on either hand,\r\n    And on the borders of the palace stand,\r\n    While o'er the rest her head she proudly rears,\r\n    And lodged amidst her guardian gods appears.\"\r\n\r\n    _Addison's Translation._\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the sixteenth century a great part of the Palatine\r\nbecame the property of the Farnese family, latterly represented by the\r\nNeapolitan Bourbons, who sold the \"Orti Farnesiani,\" in 1861, to the\r\nEmperor Napoleon III., for £10,000. Up to that time this part of the\r\nPalatine was a vast kitchen-garden, broken here and there by picturesque\r\ngroups of ilex trees and fragments of mouldering wall. In one corner was\r\na casino of the Farnese (still standing) adorned in fresco by some of\r\nthe pupils of Raphael. This and all the later buildings in the \"Orti,\"\r\nare marked with the Farnese _fleur-de-lis_, and on the principal\r\nstaircase of the garden is some really grand distemper ornament of their\r\ntime. Since 1861 extensive excavations have been carried on here under\r\nthe superintendence of Signor Rosa, which have resulted in the discovery\r\nof the palaces of some of the earlier emperors, and the substructions of\r\nseveral temples. After the revolution of 1870 the French portion of the\r\nPalatine was sold by the Ex-Emperor Napoleon to the Roman municipal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn visiting the Palace of the Cæsars, it will naturally be asked how it\r\nis known that the different buildings are what they are described to be.\r\nIn a great measure this has been ascertained from the descriptions of\r\nTacitus and other historians,--but the greatest assistance of all has\r\nbeen obtained from the Tristia of Ovid, who, while in exile, consoles\r\nhimself by recalling the different buildings of his native city, which\r\nhe mentions in describing the route taken by his book, which he had\r\npersuaded a friend to convey to the imperial library. He supposes the\r\nbook to enter the Palatine by the Clivus Victoriæ behind the Temple of\r\nVesta, and follows its course, remarking the different objects it passed\r\non the right or the left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we enter the palace by the Farnese gateway, on the right of the\r\nCampo-Vaccino, opposite SS. Cosmo e Damiano, we had better only ascend\r\nthe first division of the staircase and then turn to the left. Passing\r\nalong the lower ridge of the Palatine, afterwards occupied by many of\r\nthe great patrician houses, whose sites we shall return to and examine\r\nin detail, we reach that corner of the garden which is nearest to the\r\nArch of Titus. Here a paved road of large blocks of lava has lately been\r\nlaid bare, and is identified beyond a doubt as part of the Via Nova,\r\nwhich led from the Porta Mugonia of the Palatine along the base of the\r\nhill to the Velabrum. In the reign of Augustus it appears to have been\r\nmade to communicate also with the Forum.\r\n\r\n    \"Qua Nova Romano nunc Via juncta Foro est.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ vi. 396.\r\n\r\nAt this point the road was called _Summa Via Nova_.\r\n\r\nNear this spot must have been the site of the house where Octavius lived\r\nwith his wife Afra, the niece of Julius Cæsar (daughter of his eldest\r\nsister Julia), and where their son, Octavius, afterwards the Emperor\r\nAugustus, was born. This house afterwards passed into the possession of\r\nC. Lætorius, a patrician; but after the death of Augustus, part of it\r\nwas turned into a chapel, and consecrated to him. It was situated at the\r\ntop of a staircase--\"supra scalas annularias\"[101]--which probably led\r\nto the Forum, and is spoken of as \"ad capita bubula,\" perhaps from\r\nbulls' heads, with which it may have been decorated.\r\n\r\nHere we find ourselves, owing to the excavations, in a deep hollow\r\nbetween the two divisions of the hill. On the left is the Velia, upon\r\nwhich, near the Porta Mugonia, the Sabine king, Ancus Martius, had his\r\npalace. When Ancus died, he was succeeded by an Etruscan stranger,\r\nLucius Tarquinius, who took the name of Tarquinius Priscus. This king\r\nalso lived upon the Velia,[102] with Tanaquil his queen, and here he was\r\nmurdered in a popular rising, caused by the sons of his predecessor.\r\nHere his brave wife Tanaquil closed the doors, concealed the death of\r\nthe king, harangued the people from the windows,[103] and so gained time\r\ntill Servius Tullius was prepared to take the dead king's place and\r\navenge his murder.[104]\r\n\r\nKeeping to the valley, on our right are now some huge blocks of tufa, of\r\ngreat interest as part of the ancient _Roma Quadrata_, anterior to\r\nRomulus. Beyond this, also on the right, are foundations of the _Temple\r\nof Jupiter Stator_, built by Romulus, who vowed that he would found a\r\ntemple to Jupiter under that name, if he would arrest the flight of his\r\nRoman followers in their conflict with the superior forces of the\r\nSabines.[105]\r\n\r\n    \"Inde petens dextram, porta est, ait, ista Palati;\r\n    Hic Stator, hoc primum condita Roma loco est.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Trist._ iii. El. I.\r\n\r\n    \"Tempus idem Stator ædis habet, quam Romulus olim\r\n    Ante Palatini condidit ora jugi.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ vi. 793.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Jupiter Stator has an especial interest from its\r\nconnection with the story of Cicero and Catiline.\r\n\r\n     \"Cicéron rassembla le sénat dans le temple de Jupiter Stator. Le\r\n     choix du lieu s'explique facilement; ce temple était près de la\r\n     principale entrée du Palatin sur le Vélia, dominant, en cas\r\n     d'émeute, le Forum, que Cicéron et les principaux sénateurs\r\n     habitants du Palatin n'avaient pas à traverser comme s'il eût fallu\r\n     se rendre à la Curie. D'ailleurs Jupiter Stator, qui avait arrêté\r\n     les Sabines à la porte de Romulus, arrêterait ces nouveaux ennemis\r\n     qui voulaient sa ruine. Là Cicéron prononça la première\r\n     Catilinaire. Ce discours dut être en grande partie improvisé, car\r\n     les événements aussi improvisaient. Cicéron ne savait si Catilina\r\n     oserait se présenter devant le sénat; en le voyant entrer, il\r\n     conçut son fameux exorde: 'Jusqu'à quand, Catilina, abuseras-tu de\r\n     notre patience!'\r\n\r\n     \"Malgré la garde volontaire de chevaliers qui avait accompagné\r\n     Cicéron et qui se tenait à la porte du temple, Catilina y entra et\r\n     salua tranquillement l'assemblée; nul ne lui rendit son salut, à\r\n     son approche on s'écarta et les places restèrent vides autour de\r\n     lui. Il écouta les foudroyantes apostrophes de Cicéron, qui, après\r\n     l'avoir accablé des preuves de son crime, se bornait à lui dire:\r\n     'Sors de Rome. Va-t-en!'\r\n\r\n     \"Catilina se leva et d'un air modeste pria le sénat de ne pas\r\n     croire le consul avant qu'une enquête eût été faite. 'II n'est pas\r\n     vraisemblable, ajouta-t-il, avec une hauteur toute aristocratique,\r\n     qu'un patricien, lequel, aussi bien que ses ancêtres, a rendu\r\n     quelques services à la république, ne puisse exister que par sa\r\n     ruine, et qu'on ait besoin d'un étranger d'Arpinum pour la sauver.'\r\n     Tant d'orgueil et d'impudence révoltèrent l'assemblée; on cria à\r\n     Catilina: 'Tu es un ennemi de la patrie, un meurtrier.' Il sortit,\r\n     réunit encore ses amis, leur recommanda de se débarasser de\r\n     Cicéron, prit avec lui un aigle d'argent qui avait appartenu à une\r\n     légion de Marius, et à minuit quitta Rome et partit par la voie\r\n     Aurélia pour aller rejoindre son armée.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iv.\r\n     445.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite the foundations of Jupiter Stator, on the left,--are\r\nsome remains considered to be those of the Porta Palatii.\r\n\r\nThe valley is now blocked by a vast mass of building which entirely\r\ncloses it. This is the palace of Augustus, built in the valley between\r\nthe Velia and the other eminence of the Palatine, which Rosa, contrary\r\nto other opinions, identifies with the _Germale_. The division of the\r\nPalatine thus named, was reckoned as one of \"the seven hills\" of\r\nancient Rome. Its name was thought to be derived from Germani, owing to\r\nRomulus and Remus being found in its vicinity.[106]\r\n\r\nThe _Palace of Augustus_ was begun soon after the battle of Actium, and\r\ngradually increased in size, till the whole valley was blocked up by it,\r\nand its roofs became level with the hill-sides. Part of the ground which\r\nit covered had previously been occupied by the villa of Catiline.[107]\r\nHere Suetonius says that Augustus occupied the same bed-room for forty\r\nyears. Before the entrance of the palace it was ordained by the Senate,\r\nB.C. 26, that two bay-trees should be planted, in remembrance of the\r\ncitizens he had preserved, while an oak wreath was placed above the gate\r\nin commemoration of his victories.\r\n\r\n    \"Singula dum miror, video fulgentibus armis\r\n      Conspicuos postes, tectaque digna deo.\r\n    An Jovis hæc, dixi, domus est? Quod ut esse putarem,\r\n      Augurium menti querna corona dabat.\r\n    Cujus ut accepi dominum, non fallimur, inquam:\r\n      Et magni rerum est hanc Jovis esse domum.\r\n    Cur tamen apposita velatur janua lauro?\r\n      Cingit et Augustas arbor opaca fores?\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Trist._ i. 33.\r\n\r\n    \"State Palatinæ laurus; prætextaque quercu\r\n      Stet domus; æternos tres habet una deos.\"\r\n\r\n    _Fast._ iv. 953.\r\n\r\nIt was before the gate of this palace that Augustus upon one day in\r\nevery year sate as a beggar, receiving alms from the passers-by, in\r\nobedience to a vision that he should thus appease Nemesis.\r\n\r\nUpon the top of this building of Augustus, Vespasian built his palace in\r\nA.D. 70, not only using the walls of the older palace as a support for\r\nhis own, but filling the chambers of the earlier building entirely up\r\nwith earth, so that they became a solid massive foundation. The ruins\r\nwhich we visit are thus for the most part those of the palace of\r\nVespasian, but from one of its halls we can descend into rooms\r\nunderneath excavated from the palace of Augustus. The three projecting\r\nrostra which we now see in front of the palace are restorations by\r\nSignor Rosa.\r\n\r\nThe palace on the Palatine was not the place where the emperors\r\ngenerally lived. They resided at their villas, and came into the town to\r\nthe Palace of the Cæsars for the transaction of public business. Thus\r\nthis palace was, as it were, the St. James's of Rome. The fatigue and\r\nannoyance of a public arrival every morning, amid the crowd of clients\r\nwho always waited upon the imperial footsteps, was naturally very great,\r\nand to obviate this the emperors made use of a subterranean passage\r\nwhich ran round the whole building, and by which they were enabled to\r\narrive unobserved, and not to present themselves in public till their\r\nappearance upon the rostra in front of the building to receive the\r\nmorning salutations of their people.\r\n\r\nIf we ascend a winding path to the right, to the garden which now covers\r\nthe greater part of the hill Germale, we shall find a staircase which\r\ndescends on the left to join this passage, following which, we will\r\nascend, with the emperor, into his palace.\r\n\r\nThe passage, called _Crypto-Porticus_, is still quite perfect, and\r\nretains a great part of its mosaic pavements and much of its inlaid\r\nceilings, from which the gilt mosaic has been picked out, but the\r\npattern is still traceable. The passage was lighted from above. It was\r\nby this route that St. Laurence was led up for trial in the basilica,\r\nof the palace. Turning to the left, we again emerge upon the upper\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nThe emperor here reached the palace, but as he did not yet wish to\r\nappear in public, he turned to the left by the private passage called\r\n_Fauces_, which still remains, running behind the main halls of the\r\nbuilding. Here he was received by the different members of the imperial\r\nfamily, much as Napoleon III. was received by Princesses Mathilde,\r\nClotilde, and the Murats, in a private apartment at the Tuileries,\r\nbefore entering the ball-room. Hence, passing across the end of the\r\nbasilica, the emperor reached the portico in front of the palace,\r\nlooking down upon the hollow space where were the Temple of Jupiter\r\nStator and the other buildings connected with the early history of the\r\nRoman state. Here the whole Court received him and escorted him to the\r\ncentral rostra, where he had his public reception from the people\r\nassembled below, and whence perhaps he addressed to them a few words of\r\nmorning salutation in return. The attendants meanwhile defiled on either\r\nside to the lower terraced elevation, which still remains.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony being gone through, the emperor returned as he came, to\r\nthe basilica, for the transaction of business.\r\n\r\nThe name Basilica means \"King's House.\" It was the ancient Law Court. It\r\nusually had a portico, was oblong in form, and ended in an apse for\r\nornament. The Christians adopted it for their places of worship because\r\nit was the largest type of building then known. They also adopted the\r\nnames of the different parts of the pagan basilica, as the Confessional,\r\nfrom the _Confession_, the bar of justice at which the criminal was\r\nplaced,--the Tribune, from the _Tribunal_ of the Judge, &c. A chapel\r\nand sacristy added on either side produced the form of the cross. The\r\n_Basilica_ here is of great width. A leg of the emperor's chair actually\r\nremains _in situ_ upon the tribunal, and part of the richly wrought bar\r\nof the Confession still exists. This was the bar at which St. Laurence\r\nand many other Christian martyrs were judged. The basilica in the palace\r\nof the Cæsars was also the scene of the trial of Valerius Asiaticus in\r\nthe time of Claudius (see Chap. II.), when the Empress Messalina, who\r\nwas seated near the emperor upon the tribunal, was so overcome by the\r\ntouching eloquence of the innocent man, that she was obliged to leave\r\nthe hall to conceal her emotion,--but characteristically whispered as\r\nshe went out, that the accused must nevertheless on no account be\r\nsuffered to escape with his life,[108]--that she might take possession\r\nof his Pincian Garden, which was as Naboth's Vineyard in her eyes. An\r\naccount is extant which describes how it was necessary to increase the\r\nwidth of the seat upon the tribunal at this period, in consequence of a\r\nchange in the fashion of dress among the Roman ladies.\r\n\r\nThis basilica, though perhaps not then itself in existence, will always\r\nhave peculiar interest as showing the form and character of that earlier\r\nbasilica in the Palace of the Cæsars, in which St. Paul was tried before\r\nNero. But it is quite possible that it may be the same actual basilica\r\nitself,--and that the palace of Nero which overran the whole of the\r\nhill, may have had its basilica on this site, where it was preserved by\r\nVespasian in his later and more contracted palace.\r\n\r\n     \"The appeals from the provinces in civil causes were heard, not by\r\n     the emperor himself, but by his delegates, who were persons of\r\n     consular rank: Augustus had appointed one such delegate to hear\r\n     appeals from each province respectively. But criminal appeals\r\n     appear generally to have been heard by the emperor in person,\r\n     assisted by his council of assessors. Tiberius and Claudius had\r\n     usually sat for this purpose in the Forum; but Nero, after the\r\n     example of Augustus, heard these causes in the imperial palace,\r\n     whose ruins still crown the Palatine. Here, at one end of a\r\n     splendid hall,[109] lined with the precious marbles of Egypt and of\r\n     Libya, we must imagine Cæsar seated in the midst of his assessors.\r\n     These councillors, twenty in number, were men of the highest rank\r\n     and greatest influence. Among them were the two consuls and\r\n     selected representatives of each of the other great magistracies of\r\n     Rome. The remainder consisted of senators chosen by lot. Over this\r\n     distinguished bench of judges presided the representatives of the\r\n     most powerful monarchy which has ever existed,--the absolute ruler\r\n     of the whole civilised world.\r\n\r\n     \"Before the tribunal of the blood-stained adulterer Nero, Paul was\r\n     brought in fetters, under the custody of his military guard. The\r\n     prosecutors and their witnesses were called forward, to support\r\n     their accusation; for although the subject-matter for decision was\r\n     contained in the written depositions forwarded from Judæa by\r\n     Festus, yet the Roman law required the personal presence of the\r\n     accusers and the witnesses, whenever it could be obtained. We\r\n     already know the charges brought against the Apostle. He was\r\n     accused of disturbing the Jews in the exercise of their worship,\r\n     which was secured to them by law; of desecrating their Temple; and,\r\n     above all, of violating the public peace of the empire by perpetual\r\n     agitation, as the ringleader of a new and factious sect. This\r\n     charge was the most serious in the view of a Roman statesman; for\r\n     the crime alleged amounted to _majestas_, or treason against the\r\n     commonwealth, and was punishable with death.\r\n\r\n     \"These accusations were supported by the emissaries of the\r\n     Sanhedrim, and probably by the testimony of witnesses from Judæa,\r\n     Ephesus, Corinth, and the other scenes of Paul's activity.... When\r\n     the parties on both sides had been heard, and the witnesses all\r\n     examined, the judgment of the court was taken. Each of the\r\n     assessors gave his opinion in writing to the emperor, who never\r\n     discussed the judgment with his assessors, as had been the practice\r\n     of better emperors, but after reading their opinion, gave sentence\r\n     according to his own pleasure, without reference to the judgment\r\n     of the majority. On this occasion it might have been expected that\r\n     he would have pronounced the condemnation of the accused, for the\r\n     influence of Poppæa had now reached its culminating point, and she\r\n     was a Jewish proselyte. We can scarcely doubt that the emissaries\r\n     from Palestine would have demanded her aid for the destruction of a\r\n     traitor to the Jewish faith; nor would any scruples have prevented\r\n     her listening to their request, backed as it probably was,\r\n     according to Roman usage, by a bribe. However this may be, the\r\n     trial resulted in the acquittal of St. Paul. He was pronounced\r\n     guiltless of the charges brought against him, his fetters were\r\n     struck off, and he was liberated from his long\r\n     captivity.\"--_Conybeare and Howson._\r\n\r\nBeyond the basilica is the _Tablinum_, the great hall of the palace,\r\nwhich served as a kind of commemorative domestic museum, where family\r\nstatues and pictures were preserved. This vast room was lighted from\r\nabove, on the plan which may still be seen at Sta. Maria degli Angeli,\r\nwhich was in fact a great hall of a Roman house. The roof of this hall\r\nwas one vast arch, unsupported except by the side walls. We have record\r\nof a period when these walls were supposed insufficient for the great\r\nweight, and had to be strengthened, in interesting confirmation of which\r\nwe can still see how the second wall was added and united to the first.\r\n\r\nAppropriately opening from the family picture gallery of the Tablinum,\r\nwas the _Lararium_, a private chapel for the worship of such members of\r\nthe family--Livia and many others--as were deified after death. An\r\naltar, on the original site, has been erected here by Signor Rosa, from\r\nbits which have been found.\r\n\r\nHitherto the chambers which we have visited were open to the public;\r\nbeyond this, none but his immediate family and attendants could follow\r\nthe emperor. We now enter the _Peristyle_, a courtyard, which was open\r\nto the sky, but surrounded with arcades ornamented with statues, where\r\nwe may imagine that the empresses amused themselves with their birds\r\nand flowers. Hence, by a narrow staircase, we can descend into what is\r\nperhaps the most interesting portion of the whole, the one unearthed\r\nfragment of the actual _Palace of Augustus_, which still retains remains\r\nof gilding and fresco, and an artistic group in stucco. An original\r\nwindow remains, and it will be recollected on looking at it, that when\r\nthis was built it was not subterranean, but merely in the hollow of the\r\nvalley, afterwards filled up. In these actual rooms may have lived\r\nLivia, who in turn inhabited three houses on the Palatine, first that of\r\nher first husband Nero Drusus, whom Augustus compelled her to divorce;\r\nthen the imperial house of Augustus; and lastly that of Tiberius, the\r\nson by her first husband, whom she was the means of raising to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the _Triclinium_ or dining-room, surrounded by a skirting\r\nof pavonazzetto with a cornice of giallo. Tacitus describes a scene in\r\nthe imperial triclinium, in which the Emperor Tiberius is represented as\r\nreclining at dinner, having on one side his aged mother, the Empress\r\nLivia, and on the other his niece Agrippina, widow of Germanicus and\r\ngranddaughter of the great Augustus.[110] It was while the imperial\r\nfamily were seated at a banquet in the triclinium, in the time of Nero,\r\nthat his young step-brother Britannicus (son of Claudius and Messalina)\r\nswallowed the cup of poison which the emperor had caused Locusta to\r\nprepare and sank back dead upon his couch, his wretched sisters Antonia\r\nand Octavia, also seated at the ghastly feast, not daring to give\r\nexpression to their grief and horror,--and Nero merely desiring the\r\nattendants to carry the boy out, and saying that it was a fit to which\r\nhe was subject.[111] Here it was that Marcia the concubine presented the\r\ncup of drugged wine to the wicked Commodus, on his return from a wild\r\nbeast hunt, and produced the heavy slumber during which he was strangled\r\nby the wrestler Narcissus. In this very room also his successor\r\nPertinax, who had spent his short reign of three months in trying to\r\nreform the State, resuscitate the finances, and to heal, as far as\r\npossible, 'the wounds inflicted by the hand of tyranny,' received the\r\nnews that the guard, impatient of unwonted discipline, had risen against\r\nhim, and going forth to meet his assassins, fell, covered with wounds,\r\njust in front of the palace.[112]\r\n\r\nVitruvius says that every well-arranged Roman house has a dining-room\r\nopening into a nymphæum, and accordingly here, on the right, is a\r\n_Nymphæum_, with a beautiful fountain surrounded by miniature niches,\r\nonce filled with bronzes and statues. Water was conveyed hither by the\r\nNeronian aqueduct. The pavement of this room was of oriental alabaster,\r\nof which fragments remain.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Triclinium is a disgusting memorial of Roman imperial life,\r\nin the _Vomitorium_, with its bason, whither the feasters retired to\r\ntickle their throats with feathers, and come back with renewed appetite\r\nto the banquet.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the portico which closed the principal apartments of the\r\npalace on the south-west. Some of its Corinthian pillars have been\r\nre-erected on the sites where they were found. From hence we can look\r\ndown upon some grand walls of republican times, formed of huge tufa\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\nPassing a space of ground, called, without much authority,\r\n_Bibliotheca_, we reach a small _Theatre_ on the edge of the hill,\r\ninteresting as described by Pliny, and because the Emperor Vespasian,\r\nwho is known to have been especially fond of reciting his own\r\ncompositions, probably did so here. Hence we may look down upon the\r\nvalley between the Palatine and Aventine, where the rape of the Sabines\r\ntook place, and upon the site of the Circus Maximus. From hence, we may\r\nimagine, that the later emperors surveyed the hunts and games in that\r\ncircus, when they did not care to descend into the amphitheatre itself.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, on the right, is (partially restored) the grand staircase\r\nleading to the platform once occupied by the _Temple of Jupiter-Victor_,\r\nvowed by Fabius Maximus during the Samnite war, in the assurance that he\r\nwould gain the victory. On the steps is a sacrificial altar, which\r\nretains its grooves for the blood of the victims, with an inscription\r\nstating that it was erected by \"Cnæus Domitius C. Calvinus,\r\nPontifex,\"--who was a general under Julius Cæsar, and consul B.C. 53 and\r\nB.C. 40.\r\n\r\nNow, for some distance, there are no remains, because this space was\r\nalways kept clear, for here, constantly renewed, stood the _Hut of\r\nFaustulus and the Sacred Fig-tree_.\r\n\r\n     \"The old Roman legend ran as follows:--Procas, king of Alba, left\r\n     two sons. Numitor, the elder, being weak and spiritless, suffered\r\n     Amulius to wrest the government from him, and reduce him to his\r\n     father's private estates. In the enjoyment of these he lived rich,\r\n     and, as he desired nothing more, secure: but the usurper dreaded\r\n     the claims that might be set up by heirs of a different character.\r\n     He had Numitor's son murdered, and appointed his daughter, Silvia,\r\n     one of the Vestal virgins.\r\n\r\n     \"Amulius had no children, or at least only one daughter: so that\r\n     the race of Anchises and Aphrodite seemed on the point of\r\n     expiring, when the love of a god prolonged it, in spite of the\r\n     ordinances of man, and gave it a lustre worthy of its origin.\r\n     Silvia had gone into the sacred grove, to draw water from the\r\n     spring for the service of the temple. The sun quenched its rays:\r\n     the sight of a wolf made her fly into a cave: there Mars\r\n     overpowered the timid virgin, and then consoled her with the\r\n     promise of noble children, as Posidon consoled Tyro, the daughter\r\n     of Salmoneus. But he did not protect her from the tyrant; nor could\r\n     the protestations of her innocence save her. Vesta herself seemed\r\n     to demand the condemnation of the unfortunate priestess; for at the\r\n     moment when she was delivered of twins, the image of the goddess\r\n     hid its eyes, her altar trembled, and her fire died away. Amulius\r\n     ordered that the mother and her babes should be drowned in the\r\n     river. In the Anio Silvia exchanged her earthly life for that of a\r\n     goddess. The river carried the bole or cradle, in which the\r\n     children were lying, into the Tiber, which had overflowed its banks\r\n     far and wide, even to the foot of the woody hills. At the root of a\r\n     wild fig-tree, the Ficus Ruminalis, which was preserved and held\r\n     sacred for many centuries, at the foot of the Palatine, the cradle\r\n     overturned. A she-wolf came to drink of the stream: she heard the\r\n     whimpering of the children, carried them into her den hard by, made\r\n     a bed for them, licked and suckled them. When they wanted other\r\n     food than milk, a woodpecker, the bird sacred to Mars, brought it\r\n     to them. Other birds consecrated to auguries hovered over them, to\r\n     drive away insects. This marvellous spectacle was seen by\r\n     Faustulus, the shepherd of the royal flocks. The she-wolf drew\r\n     back, and gave up the children to human nature. Acca Laurentia, his\r\n     wife, became their foster-mother. They grew up, along with her\r\n     twelve sons, on the Palatine hill, in straw huts which they built\r\n     for themselves: that of Romulus was preserved by continual repairs,\r\n     as a sacred relic, down to the time of Nero. They were the stoutest\r\n     of the shepherd lads, fought bravely against wild beasts and\r\n     robbers, maintaining their right against every one by their might,\r\n     and turning might into right. Their booty they shared with their\r\n     comrades. The followers of Romulus were called Quinctilii, those of\r\n     Remus Fabii: the seeds of discord were soon sown amongst them.\r\n     Their wantonness engaged them in disputes with the shepherds of the\r\n     wealthy Numitor, who fed their flocks on Mount Aventine: so that\r\n     here, as in the story of Evander and Cacus, we find the quarrel\r\n     between the Palatine and the Aventine in the tales of the remotest\r\n     times. Remus was taken by the stratagem of these shepherds, and\r\n     dragged to Alba as a robber. A secret foreboding, the remembrance\r\n     of his grandsons, awakened by the story of the two brothers, kept\r\n     Numitor from pronouncing a hasty sentence. The culprit's\r\n     foster-father hastened with Romulus to the city, and told the old\r\n     man and the youths of their kindred. They resolved to avenge their\r\n     own wrong and that of their house. With their faithful comrades,\r\n     whom the dangers of Remus had brought to the city, they slew the\r\n     king; and the people of Alba again became subject to Numitor.\r\n\r\n     \"But love for the home which fate had assigned them drew the youths\r\n     back to the banks of the Tiber, to found a city there, and the\r\n     shepherds, their old companions, were their first citizens.... This\r\n     is the old tale, as it was written by Fabius, and sung in ancient\r\n     lays down to the time of Dionysius.\"--_Niebuhr's Hist. of Rome._\r\n\r\nIn the cliff of the Palatine, below the fig-tree, was shown for many\r\ncenturies the cavern Lupercal, sacred from the earliest times to the\r\nPelasgic god Pan.\r\n\r\n    \"Hinc lucum ingentum, quem Romulus acer Asylum\r\n    Retulit, et gelidâ monstrat sub rupe Lupercal,\r\n    Parrhasio dictum Panos de monte Lycæi.\"\r\n\r\n    _Virgil, Æn._ viii. 342.\r\n\r\n     \"La louve, nourrice de Romulus, a peut-être été imaginée en raison\r\n     des rapports mythologiques qui existaient entre le loup et Pan\r\n     défenseur des troupeaux. Ce qu'il y a de sûr, c'est que les fêtes\r\n     lupercales gardèrent le caractère du dieu en l'honneur duquel elles\r\n     avaient été primitivement instituées et l'empreinte d'une origine\r\n     pélasgique; ces fêtes au temps de Cicéron avaient encore un\r\n     caractère pastoral en mémoire de l'Arcadie d'où on les croyait\r\n     venues. Les Luperques qui représentaient les Satyres, compagnons de\r\n     Pan, faisaient le tour de l'antique séjour des Pélasges sur le\r\n     Palatin. Ces hommes nus allaient frappant avec les lanières de peau\r\n     de bouc, l'animal lascif par excellence, les femmes pour les rendre\r\n     fécondes; des fêtes analogues se célébraient en Arcadie sous le nom\r\n     de Lukéia (les fêtes des loups), dont le mot lupercales est une\r\n     traduction.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rome_, i. 143.\r\n\r\nIn the hut of Romulus were preserved several objects venerated as relics\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n     \"On conservait le bâton augural avec lequel Romulus avait dessiné\r\n     sur le ciel, suivant le rite étrusque, l'espace où s'était\r\n     manifesté le grand auspice des douze vautours dans lesquels Rome\r\n     crut voir la promesse des douze siècles qu'en effet le destin\r\n     devait lui accorder. Tous les augures se servirent par la suite de\r\n     ce bâton sacré, qui fut trouvé intact après l'incendie du monument\r\n     dans lequel il était conservé, miracle païen dont l'equivalent\r\n     pourrait se rencontrer dans plus d'une légende de la Rome\r\n     chrétienne. On montrait le cornouiller né du bois de la lance que\r\n     Romulus, avec la vigueur surhumaine d'un demi-dieu, avait jetée de\r\n     l'Aventin sur le Palatin, où elle s'était enfoncée dans la terre et\r\n     avait produit un grand arbre.\r\n\r\n     \"On montrait sur le Palatin le berceau et la cabane de Romulus.\r\n     Plutarque a vu ce berceau, le _Santo-Presepio_ des anciens Romains,\r\n     qui était attaché avec des liens d'airain, et sur lequel on avait\r\n     tracé des caractères mystérieux. La cabane était à un seul étage,\r\n     en planches et couverte de roseaux, que l'on reconstruisait\r\n     pieusement chaque fois qu'un incendie la détruisait; car elle brûla\r\n     à diverses reprises, ce que la nature des matériaux dont elle était\r\n     formée fait croire facilement. J'ai vu dans les environs de Rome un\r\n     cabaret rustique dont la toiture était exactement pareille à celle\r\n     de là cabane de Romulus.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ i. 342.\r\n\r\nTurning along the terrace which overhangs the Velabrum we reach the\r\nruins of the _Palace of Tiberius_,[113] in which he resided during the\r\nearlier part of his reign, when he was under the influence of his aged\r\nand imperious mother Livia. Here he had to mourn for Drusus, his only\r\nson, who fell a victim (A.D. 23) to poison administered to him by his\r\nwife Livilla and her lover the favourite Sejanus. Here also, in A.D. 29,\r\ndied Livia, widow of Augustus, at the age of eighty-six, \"a memorable\r\nexample of successful artifice, having attained in succession, by craft\r\nif not by crime, every object she could desire in the career of female\r\nambition.\"[114]\r\n\r\nThe row of arches remaining are those of the soldiers' quarters. In the\r\nfourth arch is a curious _graffite_ of a ship. In another the three\r\npavements in use at different times may be seen _in situ_, one above\r\nanother. On the terrace above these arches has recently been discovered\r\na large piscina, or _fish-pond_, and the painted chambers of a building,\r\nwhich is supposed to have been the _House of Drusus_ (elder brother of\r\nTiberius) _and Antonia_. Several of the rooms in this building are\r\nrichly decorated in fresco, one has a picture of a street with figures\r\nof females going to a sacrifice, and of ladies at their toilette;\r\nanother of Mercury, Io, and Argus; and a third of Galatea and\r\nPolyphemus. From the names of the characters in these pictures\r\nrepresented being affixed to them in Greek, we may naturally conclude\r\nthat they are the work of Greek artists.\r\n\r\nThe north-eastern corner of the area is entirely occupied by the vast\r\nruins of the _Palace of Caligula_, built against the side of the hill\r\nabove the _Clivus Victoriœ_, which still remains, and consisting of\r\nranges of small rooms, communicating with open galleries, edged by\r\nmarble balustrades, of which a portion exists. In these rooms the\r\nhalf-mad Caius Caligula rushed about, sometimes dressed as a charioteer,\r\nsometimes as a warrior, and delighted in astonishing his courtiers by\r\nhis extraordinary pranks, or shocking them by trying to enforce a belief\r\nin his own divinity.[115]\r\n\r\n     \"C'est dans ce palais que, tourmenté par l'insomnie et par\r\n     l'agitation de son âme furieuse, il passera une partie de la nuit à\r\n     errer sous d'immenses portiques, attendant et appellant le jour.\r\n     C'est là aussi qu'il aura l'incroyable idée de placer un dieu\r\n     infâme.\r\n\r\n     \"Caligula se fit bâtir sur le Palatin deux temples. Il avait\r\n     d'abord voulu avoir une demeure sur le mont Capitolin; mais, ayant\r\n     réfléchi que Jupiter l'avait precédé au Capitole, il en prit de\r\n     l'humeur et retourna sur le Palatin. Dans les folies de Caligula,\r\n     on voit se manifester cette pensée: Je suis dieu! pensée qui\r\n     n'était peut-être pas très-extraordinaire chez un jeune homme de\r\n     vingt-cinq ans devenu tout-à-coup maître du monde. Il parut en\r\n     effet croire à sa divinité, prenant le nom et les attributs de\r\n     divers dieux, et changeant de nature divine en changeant de\r\n     perruque.\r\n\r\n     \"Non content de s'élever un temple à lui-même, Caligula en vint à\r\n     être son propre prêtre et à s'adorer. Le despotisme oriental avait\r\n     connu cette adoration étrange de soi: sur les monuments de l'Egypte\r\n     on voit Ramsès-roi présenter son offrande à Ramsès-dieu; mais\r\n     Caligula fit ce que n'avait fait aucun Pharaon; il se donna pour\r\n     collègue, dans ce culte de sa propre personne, son cheval, qu'il ne\r\n     nomma pas, mais qu'il songea un moment de nommer consul.\"--_Ampère,\r\n     Emp._ ii. 8.\r\n\r\n     Here \"one day at a public banquet, when the consuls were reclining\r\n     by his side, Caligula burst suddenly into a fit of laughter; and\r\n     when they courteously inquired the cause of his mirth, astounded\r\n     them by coolly replying that he was thinking how by one word he\r\n     could cause both their heads to roll on the floor. He amused\r\n     himself with similar banter even with his wife Cæsonia, for whom he\r\n     seems to have had a stronger feeling than for any of his former\r\n     consorts. While fondling her neck he is reported to have said,\r\n     'Fair as it is, how easily I could sever it.'\"--_Merivale_, ch.\r\n     xlviii.\r\n\r\nAfter the murder of Caligula (Jan. 24, 794) by the tribune Cheræa, in\r\nthe vaulted passage which led from the palace to the theatre, a singular\r\nchance which occurred in this part of the palace led to the elevation of\r\nClaudius to the throne.\r\n\r\n     \"In the confusion which ensued upon the death of Caius, several of\r\n     the prætorian guards had flung themselves furiously into the palace\r\n     and began to plunder its glittering chambers. None dared to offer\r\n     them any opposition; the slaves or freedmen fled and concealed\r\n     themselves. One of the inmates, half-hidden behind a curtain in an\r\n     obscure corner, was dragged forth with brutal violence; and great\r\n     was the intruder's surprise when they recognised him as Claudius,\r\n     the long despised and neglected uncle of the murdered emperor.[116]\r\n     He sank at their feet almost senseless with terror: but the\r\n     soldiers in their wildest mood still respected the blood of the\r\n     Cæsars, and instead of slaying or maltreating the suppliant, the\r\n     brother of Germanicus, they hailed him, more in jest perhaps than\r\n     earnest, with the title of Imperator, and carried him off to their\r\n     camp.\"--_Merivale_, ch. xlix.\r\n\r\nIn this same palace Claudius was feasting when he was told that his\r\nhitherto idolised wife Messalina was dead, without being told whether\r\nshe died by her own hand or another's,--and asked no questions, merely\r\ndesiring a servant to pour him out some more wine, and went on eating\r\nhis supper.[117] Here also Claudius, who so dearly loved eating,\r\ndevoured his last and fatal supper of poisoned mushrooms which his next\r\nloving wife (and niece) Agrippina prepared for him, to make way for her\r\nson Nero upon the throne.[118]\r\n\r\nThe Clivus Victoriæ commemorates by its name the _Temple of\r\nVictory_,[119] said to have been founded by the Sabine aborigines before\r\nthe time of Romulus, and to be the earliest temple at Rome of which\r\nthere is any mention except that of Saturnus. This temple was rebuilt by\r\nthe consul L. Posthumius.\r\n\r\nChief of a group of small temples, the famous _Temple of Cybele_,\r\n\"Mother of the Gods,\" stood at this corner of the Palatine. Thirteen\r\nyears before it was built, the \"Sacred Stone,\" the form under which the\r\n\"Idæan Mother\" was worshipped, had been brought from Pessinus in\r\nPhrygia, because, according to the Sibylline books, frequent showers of\r\nstones which had occurred could only be expiated by its being\r\ntransported to Rome. It was given up to the Romans by their ally\r\nAttalus, king of Pergamus, and P. Cornelius Scipio, the young brother of\r\nAfricanus--accounted the worthiest and most virtuous of the Romans--was\r\nsent to receive it. As the vessel bearing the holy stone came up the\r\nTiber it grounded at the foot of the Aventine, when the aruspices\r\ndeclared that only chaste hands would be able to move it. Then the\r\nVestal Claudia drew the vessel up the river by a rope.\r\n\r\n     \"Ainsi Sainte Brigitte, Suédoise morte à Rome, prouva sa pureté en\r\n     touchant le bois de l'autel, qui reverdit soudain. Une statue fut\r\n     érigée à Claudia, dans le vestibule du temple de Cybèle. Bien\r\n     qu'elle eût été, disait on, seule épargnée dans deux incendies du\r\n     temple, nous n'avons plus cette statue, mais nous avons au Capitole\r\n     un bas-relief où l'événement miraculeux est représenté. C'est un\r\n     autel dédié par une affranchie de la gens Claudia; il a été trouvé\r\n     au pied de l'Aventin, près du lieu qu'on désignait comme celui où\r\n     avait été opéré le miracle.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 142.\r\n\r\nIn her temple, which was _round and surmounted_ by a cupola, Cybele was\r\nrepresented by a statue with its face to the east; the building was\r\nadorned with a painting of Corybantes, and plays were acted in front of\r\nit.[120]\r\n\r\n          \"Qua madidi sunt tecta Lyæi\r\n    Et Cybeles picto stat Corybante domus.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial, Ep._ i. 71, 9.\r\n\r\nThis temple, after its second destruction by fire, was entirely rebuilt\r\nby Augustus in A.D. 2.\r\n\r\n     \"Cybèle est certainement la grande déesse, la grande mère,\r\n     c'est-à-dire la personnification de la fécondité et de la vie\r\n     universelle: bizarre idole qui présente le spectacle hideux de\r\n     mamelles disposés par paires le long d'un corps comme enveloppé\r\n     dans une gaîne, et d'où sortent des taureaux et des abeilles,\r\n     images des forces créatrices et des puissances ordonnatrices de la\r\n     nature. On honorait cette déesse de l'Asie par des orgies\r\n     furieuses, par un mélange de débauche effrénée et de rites cruels;\r\n     ses prêtres efféminés dansaient au son des flûtes lydiennes et de\r\n     ses _crotales_, véritables castagnettes, semblables à celles que\r\n     fait résonner aujourd'hui la paysanne romaine en dansant la\r\n     fougueuse _saltarelle_. On voit au musée du Capitole l'effigie\r\n     bas-relief d'un _archigalle_, d'un chef de ces prêtres insensés, et\r\n     près de lui les attributs de la déesse asiatique, les flûtes, les\r\n     crotales, et la mystérieuse corbeille. Cet archigalle, avec son air\r\n     de femme, sa robe qui conviendrait à une femme, nous retrace\r\n     l'espèce de démence religieuse à laquelle s'associaient les délires\r\n     pervers d'Héliogabale.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 310.\r\n\r\nWe have the authority of Martial[121] that in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the temple of Cybele, stood the _Temple of Apollo_,\r\nthough Signor Rosa places it on the other side of the hill in the\r\ngardens of S. Buonaventura. Its remains have yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\n     \"Nothing could exceed the magnificence of this temple, according to\r\n     the accounts of ancient authors. Propertius, who was present at its\r\n     dedication, has devoted a short elegy to the description of it, and\r\n     Ovid describes it as a splendid structure of white marble.\r\n\r\n    'Tum medium claro surgebat marmore templum,\r\n        Et patria Phœbo carius Ortygia.\r\n    Auro solis erat supra fastigia currus,\r\n        Et valvæ Libyci nobile dentis opus.\r\n    Altera dejectos Parnassi vertice Gallos,\r\n        Altera mœrebat funera Tantalidos.\r\n    Deinde inter matrem Deus ipse, interque sororem\r\n        Pythius in longa carmina veste sonat.'\r\n\r\n    _Propertius,_ ii. _El._ 31.\r\n\r\n    'Inde timore pari gradibus sublimia celsis\r\n        Ducor ad intonsi candida templa Dei.'\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Trist._ iii. _El._ 1.\r\n\r\n     \"From the epithet _aurea_ porticus, it seems probable that the\r\n     cornice of the portico which surrounded it was gilt. The columns\r\n     were of African marble, or _giallo-antico_, and must have been\r\n     fifty-two in number, as between them were the statues of the fifty\r\n     Danaids, and that of their father, brandishing a naked sword.\r\n\r\n    'Quæris cur veniam tibi tardior? aurea Phœbi\r\n      Porticus a magno Cæsare aperta fuit.\r\n    Tota erat in speciem Pœnis digesta columnis:\r\n      Inter quas Danai fœmina turba senis.'\r\n\r\n    _Propert._ ii. _El._ 31.\r\n\r\n    'Signa peregrinis ubi sunt alterna columnis\r\n      Belides, et stricto barbarus ense pater.'\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Trist._ iii. 1. 61.\r\n\r\n     \"Here also was a statue of Apollo sounding the lyre, apparently a\r\n     likeness of Augustus; whose beauty when a youth, to judge from his\r\n     bust in the Vatican, might well entitle him to counterfeit the god.\r\n     Around the altar were the images of four oxen, the work of Myron,\r\n     so beautifully sculptured that they seemed alive. In the middle of\r\n     the portico rose the temple, apparently of white marble. Over the\r\n     pediment was the chariot of the sun. The gates were of ivory, one\r\n     of them sculptured with the story of the giants hurled down from\r\n     the heights of Parnassus, the other representing the destruction of\r\n     the Niobids. Inside the temple was the statue of Apollo in a tunica\r\n     talaris, or long garment, between his mother Latona and his sister\r\n     Diana, the work of Scopas, Cephisodorus, and Timotheus. Under the\r\n     base of Apollo's statue Augustus caused to be buried the Sibylline\r\n     books which he had selected and placed in gilt chests. Attached to\r\n     the temple was a library called _Bibliotheca Græca et Latina_,\r\n     apparently, however, only one structure, containing the literature\r\n     of both tongues. Only the choicest works were admitted to the\r\n     honour of a place in it, as we may infer from Horace:\r\n\r\n                          'Tangere vitet\r\n    Scripta, Palatinus quæcunque recepit Apollo.'\r\n\r\n    _Ep._ i. 3. 16.\r\n\r\n     \"The library appears to have contained a bronze statue of Apollo,\r\n     fifty feet high; whence we must conclude that the roof of the hall\r\n     exceeded that height. In this library, or more probably, perhaps,\r\n     in an adjoining apartment, poets, orators, and philosophers recited\r\n     their productions. The listless demeanour of the audience on such\r\n     occasions seems, from the description of the younger Pliny, to have\r\n     been, in general, not over-encouraging. Attendance seems to have\r\n     been considered as a friendly duty.\"--_Dyer's City of Rome._\r\n\r\nThe temple of Apollo was built by Augustus to commemorate the battle of\r\nActium. He appropriated to it part of the land covered with houses which\r\nhe had purchased upon the Palatine;--another part he gave to the\r\nVestals; the third he used for his own palace.\r\n\r\n    \"Phœbus habet partem, Vestæ pars altera cessit:\r\n    Quod superest illis, tertius ipse tenet.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Stet domus, æternos tres habet una deos.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ iv. 951.\r\n\r\nThus Apollo and Vesta became as it were the household gods of Augustus:\r\n\r\n    \"Vestaque Cæsareos inter sacrata penates,\r\n    Et cum Cæsarea tu, Phœbe domestice, Vesta.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Metam._ xv. 864.\r\n\r\nOther temples on the Palatine were that of _Juno_ Sospita:\r\n\r\n    \"Principio mensis Phrygiæ contermina Matri\r\n      Sospita delubris dicitur aucta novis.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ ii. 55.\r\n\r\nof Minerva:\r\n\r\n    \"Sexte, Palatinæ cultor facunde Minervæ\r\n      Ingenio frueris qui propiore Dei.\"\r\n\r\n     _Martial,_ v. _Ep._ 5.\r\n\r\na temple of Moonlight mentioned by Varro (iv. 10) and a shrine of Vesta.\r\n\r\n    \"Vestaque Cæsareos inter sacrata penates.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Met._ i.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Torretta del Palatino_ which is near the house of Caligula,\r\nthere is a magnificent view over the seven hills of Rome;--the Palatine,\r\nAventine, Capitoline, Cœlian, Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquiline. From\r\nthis point also it is very interesting to remember that these were not\r\nthe heights considered as \"the Seven Hills\" in the ancient history of\r\nRome, when the sacrifices of the _Septimontium_ were offered upon the\r\nPalatine, Velia, and Germale, the three divisions of the Palatine--of\r\nwhich one can no longer be traced; upon the Fagutal, Oppius, and\r\nCispius, the secondary heights of the Esquiline; and upon the Suburra,\r\nwhich perhaps comprehended the Viminal.[122] Hence also we see the\r\nground we have traversed on the Palatine spread before us like a map.\r\n\r\nIf we descend the staircase in the Palace of Caligula, we may trace as\r\nfar as the Porta Romana the piers of the _Bridge of Caligula_, which,\r\nhalf in vanity, half in madness, he threw across the valley, that he\r\nmight, as he said, the more easily hold intercourse with his friend and\r\ncomrade Jupiter upon the Capitol. One of the piers which he used for his\r\nbridge, beyond the limits of the palace, was formed by the temple of\r\nAugustus built by Tiberius.[123] This bridge, with all other works of\r\nCaligula, was of very short duration, being destroyed immediately after\r\nhis death by Claudius.\r\n\r\nReturning by the Clivus Victoriæ, we shall find ourselves again on the\r\neastern slope of the hill from which we started, the site once occupied\r\nby so many of the great patrician families. Here at one time lived Caius\r\nGracchus, who to gratify the populace, gave up his house on the side of\r\nthe Palatine, and made his home in the gloomy Suburra. Here also lived\r\nhis coadjutor in the consulship, Fulvius Flaccus, who shared his fate,\r\nand whose house was razed to the ground by the people after his murder.\r\nAt this corner of the hill also was the house of Q. Lutatius Catulus,\r\npoet and historian, who was consul B.C. 102, and together with Marius\r\nwas conqueror of the Cimbri in a great battle near Vercelli. In memory\r\nof this he founded a temple of the \"Fortuna hujusce diei,\" and decorated\r\nthe portico of his house with Cimbrian trophies. Varro mentions that his\r\nhouse had also a domed roof.[124] Here also the consul Octavius,\r\nmurdered on the Janiculum by the partisans of Marius, had a house, which\r\nwas rebuilt with great magnificence by Emilius Scaurus, who adorned it\r\nwith columns of marble thirty-eight feet high.[125] These two last-named\r\nhouses were bought by the wealthy Clodius, who gave 14,800,000\r\nsesterces, or about 130,000_l._, for that of Scaurus, and throwing down\r\nthe Porticus Catuli, included its site, and the house of E. Scaurus, in\r\nhis own magnificent dwelling. Clodius was a member of the great house of\r\nthe Claudii, and was the favoured lover of Pompeia, wife of Julius\r\nCæsar, by whose connivance, disguised as a female musician, he attempted\r\nto be present at the orgies of the Bona Dea, which were celebrated in\r\nthe house of the Pontifex Maximus close to the temple of Vesta, and from\r\nwhich men were so carefully excluded, that even a male mouse, says\r\nJuvenal, dared not show himself there. The position of his own dwelling,\r\nand that of the pontifex, close to the foot of the Clivus Victoriæ,\r\nafforded every facility for this adventure, but it was discovered by his\r\nlosing himself in the passages of the Regia. A terrible scandal was the\r\nresult--Cæsar divorced Pompeia, and the senate referred the matter to\r\nthe pontifices, who declared that Clodius was guilty of sacrilege.\r\nClodius attempted to prove an alibi, but Cicero's evidence showed that\r\nhe was with him in Rome only three hours before he pretended to have\r\nbeen at Interamna. Bribery and intimidation secured his acquittal by a\r\nmajority of thirty-one to twenty-five,[126] but from this time a deadly\r\nenmity ensued between him and Cicero.\r\n\r\nThe house of Clodius naturally leads us to that of Cicero, which was\r\nalso situated at this corner of the Palatine, whence he could see his\r\nclients in the Forum and go to and fro to his duties there. This house\r\nhad been built for M. Livius Drusus, who, when his architect proposed a\r\nplan to prevent its being overlooked, answered, \"Rather build it so that\r\nall my fellow-citizens may behold everything that I do.\" In his acts\r\nDrusus seemed to imitate the Gracchi; but he sought popularity for its\r\nown sake, and after being the object of a series of conspiracies was\r\nfinally murdered in the presence of his mother Cornelia, in his own\r\nhall, where the image of his father was sprinkled with his blood. When\r\ndying he turned to those around him and asked, with characteristic\r\narrogance, based perhaps upon conscious honesty of purpose, \"when will\r\nthe commonwealth have a citizen like me again?\" After the death of\r\nDrusus the house was inhabited by L. Licinius Crassus the orator, who\r\nlived here in great elegance and luxury. His house was called from its\r\nbeauty \"the Venus of the Palatine,\" and was remarkable for its size, the\r\ntaste of its furniture, and the beauty of its grounds. \"It was adorned\r\nwith pillars of Hymettian marble, with expensive vases, and triclinia\r\ninlaid with brass. His gardens were provided with fishponds, and some\r\nnoble lotus-trees shaded his walks. Ahenobarbus, his colleague in the\r\ncensorship, found fault with such corruption of manners,[127] estimated\r\nhis house at a hundred million, or, according to Valerius Maximus,[128]\r\nsix million sesterces, and complained of his crying for the loss of a\r\nlamprey as if it had been a daughter. It was a tame lamprey which used\r\nto come at the call of Crassus, and feed out of his hand. Crassus\r\nretorted by a public speech against his colleague, and by his great\r\npowers of ridicule, turned him into derision; jested upon his name,[129]\r\nand to the accusation of weeping for a lamprey, replied, that it was\r\nmore than Ahenobarbus had done for the loss of any of his three\r\nwives.\"[130] Cicero purchased the house of Crassus a year or two after\r\nhis consulate for a sum equal to about 30,000_l._, and removed thither\r\nfrom the Carinæ with his wife Terentia. His house was close to that of\r\nClodius, but a little lower down the hill, which enabled him to threaten\r\nto increase the height, so as to shut out his neighbour's view of the\r\ncity. Upon his accession to the tribuneship Clodius procured the\r\ndisgrace of Cicero, and after his flight to Greece, obtained a decree of\r\nbanishment against him. He then pillaged and destroyed his house upon\r\nthe Palatine, as well as his villas at Tusculum and Formia, and obliged\r\nTerentia to take refuge with the Vestals, whose Superior was fortunately\r\nher sister. But in the following year, a change of consuls and revulsion\r\nof the popular favour led to the recall of Cicero, who found part of his\r\nhouse appropriated by Clodius, who had erected a shrine to Libertas\r\n(with a statue which was that of a Greek courtezan carried off from the\r\ntomb)[131] on the site of the remainder, which he had razed to the\r\nground.[132]\r\n\r\n     \"Clodius had also destroyed the portico of Catulus; in fact, he\r\n     appears to have been desirous of appropriating all this side of the\r\n     Palatine. He wanted to buy the house of the ædile Seius. Seius\r\n     having declared that so long as he lived, Clodius should not have\r\n     it, Clodius caused him to be poisoned, and then bought his house\r\n     under a feigned name! He was thus enabled to erect a portico three\r\n     hundred feet in length, in place of that of Catulus. The latter,\r\n     however, was afterwards restored at the public expense.\r\n\r\n     \"Cicero obtained public grants for the restoration of his house and\r\n     of his Tusculan and Formian villas, but very far from enough to\r\n     cover the losses he had suffered. The aristocratic part of the\r\n     Senate appears to have envied and grudged the _novus homo_ to whose\r\n     abilities they looked for protection. He was advised not to rebuild\r\n     his house on the Palatine, but to sell the ground. It was not in\r\n     Cicero's temper to take such a course; but he was hampered ever\r\n     after with debts. Clodius, who had been defeated but not beaten,\r\n     still continued his persecutions. He organised a gang of street\r\n     boys to call out under Cicero's windows, 'Bread! Bread!' His bands\r\n     interrupted the dramatic performances on the Palatine, at the\r\n     Megalesian games, by rushing upon the stage. On another occasion,\r\n     Clodius, at the head of his myrmidons, besieged the Senate in the\r\n     temple of Concord. He attacked Cicero in the streets, to the danger\r\n     of his life; and when he had begun to rebuild his house, drove away\r\n     the masons, overthrew what part had been re-erected of Catulus'\r\n     portico, and cast burning torches into the house of Quintus Cicero,\r\n     which he had hired next to his brother's on the Palatine, and\r\n     consumed a great part of it.\"--_Dyer's City of Rome_, 152.\r\n\r\nThe indemnity which Cicero received from the state in order to rebuild\r\nhis house on the Palatine, amounted to about 16,000_l._ The house of\r\nQuintus Cicero was rebuilt close to his brother's at the same time by\r\nCyrus, the fashionable architect of the day.[133]\r\n\r\nAmong other noble householders on this part of the Palatine was Mark\r\nAntony,[134] whose house was afterwards given by Augustus to Agrippa and\r\nMessala, soon after which it was burnt down.\r\n\r\nA small _Museum_ in this part of the garden contains some of the\r\nsmaller objects which have been found in the excavations, and specimens\r\nof the different marbles and alabasters. There is nothing of any great\r\nimportance. The fragments of statues and some busts which have been\r\nfound (including Flavia Domitilla, wife of Vespasian, and Julia,\r\ndaughter of Titus), have been sent to Paris, but casts have been left\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nWe have now made the round of the French division of the Palatine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been decided that some remains which exist in the garden of the\r\nVilla Mills (now a Convent of Visitandine Nuns) are those of the House\r\nof Hortensius, an orator, \"who was second only to Cicero in eloquence,\r\nand who, in the early part at least of their lives, was his chief\r\nopponent.\"[135] Cicero himself describes the extraordinary gifts of his\r\nrival[136] as well as the integrity with which he fulfilled the duties\r\nof a quæstor.[137] In the latter portion of his public career Hortensius\r\nwas frequently engaged on the same side with Cicero, and then always\r\nrecognised his superiority by allowing him to speak last. Hortensius\r\ndied B.C. 50, to the great grief of his ancient rival.[138] The splendid\r\nvillas of Hortensius were celebrated. He was accustomed to water his\r\ntrees with wine at regular intervals,[139] and had huge fishponds at\r\nBauli, into which the salt-water fish came to be fed from his hand, and\r\nhe became so fond of them, that he wept for the death of a favourite\r\nmuræna.[140] But the house on the Palatine was exceedingly simple and\r\nhad no decorations but plain columns of Alban stone.[141] This was the\r\nchosen residence of Augustus, until, upon its destruction by fire, the\r\ncitizens insisted upon raising the more sumptuous residence in the\r\nhollow of the Palatine by public subscription. The subterranean chambers\r\nwhich have been discovered have some interesting remains of stucco\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nThe villa, which is now turned into a convent, possessed some frescoes\r\npainted by Giulio Romano from designs of Raphael, but these have been\r\ndestroyed or removed in deference to the modesty of the present\r\ninhabitants. The neighbouring church and garden of S. Sebastiano occupy\r\nthe site of the _Gardens of Adonis_. (See Chap. IV.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA large, and by far the most picturesque portion of the Palace of the\r\nCæsars (the only part which was not imbedded in soil ten years ago), is\r\nnow accessible either from the end of the lane of S. Buenaventura, or\r\nfrom a gate on the left of the Via dei Fienili just before reaching Sta.\r\nAnastasia. The excavations in the last-named quarter were begun by the\r\nEmperor of Russia, who purchased the site, but afterwards presented it\r\nto the city.\r\n\r\nBehind Sta. Maria Liberatrice, in some farm buildings, are remains which\r\nprobably belong to the Regia of Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, against the escarpment of the Palatine, a part of the\r\n_Walls of Romulus_ has been discovered, built in large oblong blocks.\r\nHere also are fragments of bases of towers of republican times. Behind\r\nS. Teodoro are remains of an early concrete wall, behind which the tufa\r\nrock is visible. The wall is only built where the tufa is of a soft\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n     \"La système de construction est le même que dans les villes\r\n     d'Étrurie et dans la muraille bâtie à Rome par les rois étrusques.\r\n     Cependant l'appareil est moins régulier. Les murs d'une petite\r\n     ville du Latium fondée par un aventurier ne pouvaient être aussi\r\n     soignés que les murs des villes de l'Étrurie, pays tout autrement\r\n     civilisé. La petite cité de Romulus, bornée au Palatin, n'avait pas\r\n     l'importance de la Rome des Tarquins, qui couvrait les huit\r\n     collines.\r\n\r\n     \"Du reste, la construction est étrusque et devait l'être. Romulus\r\n     n'avait dans sa ville, habitée par des pâtres et des bandits,\r\n     personne qui fût capable d'en bâtir l'enceinte. Les Étrusques,\r\n     grands bâtisseurs, étaient de l'autre côté du fleuve. Quelques-uns\r\n     même l'avaient probablement passé déjà et habitaient le mont\r\n     Cœlius. Romulus dut s'adresser à eux, et faire faire cet ouvrage\r\n     par des architects et des maçons étrusques. Ce fut aussi selon le\r\n     rite de l'Étrurie, pays sacerdotal, que Romulus, suivant en cela\r\n     l'usage établi dans les cités latines, fit consacer l'enceinte de\r\n     la ville nouvelle. Il agit en cette circonstance comme agit un\r\n     paysan romain, quand il appelle un prêtre pour bénir l'emplacement\r\n     de la maison qu'il veut bâtir.\r\n\r\n     \"Les détails de la cérémonie par laquelle fut inaugurée la première\r\n     enceinte de Rome nous ont été transmis par Plutarque,[142] et, avec\r\n     un grand détail par Tacite,[143] qui sans doute avait sous les yeux\r\n     les livres des pontifes. Nous connaissons avec exactitude le\r\n     contour que traça la charrue sacrée. Nous pouvons le suivre encore\r\n     aujourd'hui.\r\n\r\n     \"Romulus attela an taureau blanc et une vache blanche à une charrue\r\n     dont le soc était d'airain.[144] L'usage de l'airain a précédé à\r\n     Rome, comme partout, l'usage du fer. Il partit du lieu consacré par\r\n     l'antique autel d'Hercule, au-dessous de l'angle occidental du\r\n     Palatin et de la première Rome des Pelasges, et, se dirigeant vers\r\n     le sud-est, traça son sillon le long de la base de la colline.\r\n\r\n     \"Ceux qui suivaient Romulus, rejetaient les mottes de terre en\r\n     dedans du sillon, image du Vallum futur. Ce sillon était l'Agger de\r\n     Servius Tullius en petit. A l'extrémité de la vallée qui sépare le\r\n     Palatin de l'Aventin, où devait être le grand cirque, et où est\r\n     aujourd'hui la rue des _Cerchi_, il prit à gauche, et, contournant\r\n     la colline, continua, en creusant toujours son sillon, à tracer\r\n     sans le savoir la route que devaient suivre un jour les triomphes,\r\n     puis revint au point d'où il était parti. La charrue, l'instrument\r\n     du labour, le symbole de la vie agricole des enfants de Saturne,\r\n     avait dessiné le contour de la cité guerrière de Romulus. De même,\r\n     quand on avait détruit une ville, on faisait passer la charrue sur\r\n     le sol qu'elle avait occupé. Par là, ce sol devenait sacré, et il\r\n     n'était pas plus permis de l'habiter qu'il ne l'était de franchir\r\n     le sillon qu'on creusait autour des villes lors de leur fondation,\r\n     comme le fit Romulus et comme le firent toujours depuis les\r\n     fondateurs d'une colonie; car toute colonie était une\r\n     Rome.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rome_, i. 283.\r\n\r\nClose under this, the northern side of the walls of Romulus, ran the\r\n_Via Nova_, down which Marcus Cædicius was returning to the city in the\r\ngloaming, when, at this spot, between the sacred grove and the temple of\r\nVesta, he heard a supernatural voice, bidding him to warn the senate of\r\nthe approach of the Gauls. After the Gauls had invaded Rome, and\r\ndeparted again, an altar and sanctuary recorded the miracle on this\r\nsite.[145]\r\n\r\nAt the corner near Sta. Anastasia, are remains of a private house of\r\nearly times built against the cliff. Near this were the steps called the\r\n_Stairs of Cacus_, leading up to the hut of Faustulus. On the other side\r\nthe _Gradus Pulchri Littoris_, the κλη Ακτη of Plutarch, led to the\r\nriver.[146]\r\n\r\nHere a remarkable altar of republican times has been discovered, and\r\nremains _in situ_. It is inscribed SEI DEO SEI DIVAE SAC.--C SEXTIVS C T\r\nCALVINUS TR--DE SENATI SENTENTIA RESTITVIT. Some suppose this to be the\r\nactual altar mentioned above as erected to the Genius Loci, in\r\nconsequence of the mysterious warning of the Gallic invasion. The father\r\nof the tribune, C. S. Calvinus, mentioned in the inscription, was consul\r\nwith C. Cassius Longinus, B.C. 124, and is described by Cicero as an\r\nelegant orator of a sickly constitution.[147]\r\n\r\nBeyond this a number of chambers have been discovered under the steep\r\nbank of the Palatine, and retain a quantity of _graffiti_ scratched upon\r\ntheir walls. The most interesting of these, found in the fourth chamber,\r\nhas been removed to the museum of the Collegio Romano. It is generally\r\nbelieved to have been executed during the reign of Septimius Severus,\r\nand to have been done in an idle moment by one of the soldiers occupying\r\nthese rooms, supposed to have been used as guard-chambers under that\r\nemperor. If so, it is perhaps the earliest existing pictorial allusion\r\nto the manner of our Saviour's death. It is a caricature evidently\r\nexecuted in ridicule of a Christian fellow-soldier. The figure on the\r\ncross has an ass's head, and by the worshipping figure is inscribed in\r\nGreek characters, _Alexamenos worships his God_.\r\n\r\n     \"The lowest orders of the populace were as intelligently hostile to\r\n     it [the worship of the Crucified] as were the philosophers. Witness\r\n     that remarkable caricature of the adoration of our crucified Lord,\r\n     which was discovered some ten years ago beneath the ruins of the\r\n     Palatine palace. It is a rough sketch, traced, in all probability,\r\n     by the hand of some pagan slave in one of the earliest years of the\r\n     third century of our era. A human figure with an ass's head is\r\n     represented as fixed to a cross, while another figure in a tunic\r\n     stands on one side. This figure is addressing himself to the\r\n     crucified monster, and is making a gesture which was the customary\r\n     pagan expression of adoration. Underneath there runs a rude\r\n     inscription: _Alexamenos adores his God_. Here we are face to face\r\n     with a touching episode of the life of the Roman Church in the days\r\n     of Severus or of Caracalla. As under Nero, so, a century and a half\r\n     later, there were worshippers of Christ in the household of Cæsar.\r\n     But the paganism of the later date was more intelligently and\r\n     bitterly hostile to the Church than the paganism which had shed the\r\n     blood of the apostles. The Gnostic invective which attributed to\r\n     the Jews the worship of an ass, was applied by pagans\r\n     indiscriminately to Jews and Christians. Tacitus attributes the\r\n     custom to a legend respecting services rendered by wild asses to\r\n     the Israelites in the desert; 'and so, I suppose,' observes\r\n     Tertullian, 'it was thence presumed that we, as bordering upon the\r\n     Jewish religion, were taught to worship such a figure.' Such a\r\n     story, once current, was easily adapted to the purposes of a pagan\r\n     caricaturist. Whether from ignorance of the forms of Christian\r\n     worship, or in order to make his parody of it more generally\r\n     intelligible to its pagan admirers, the draughtsman has ascribed to\r\n     Alexamenos the gestures of a heathen devotee. But the real object\r\n     of his parody is too plain to be mistaken. Jesus Christ, we may be\r\n     sure, had other confessors and worshippers in the Imperial palace\r\n     as well as Alexamenos. The moral pressure of the advancing Church\r\n     was felt throughout all ranks of pagan society; ridicule was\r\n     invoked to do the work of argument; and the moral persecution which\r\n     crowned all true Christian devotion was often only the prelude to a\r\n     sterner test of that loyalty to a crucified Lord, which was as\r\n     insensible to the misrepresentations, as Christian faith was\r\n     superior to the logic, of heathendom.\"[148]--_Liddon, Bampton\r\n     Lectures of 1866_, lect. vii. p. 593.\r\n\r\nThese chambers acquire a great additional interest from the belief which\r\nmany entertain that they are those once occupied by the Prætorian Guard,\r\nin which St. Paul was confined.\r\n\r\n     \"The close of the Epistle to the Ephesians contains a remarkable\r\n     example of the forcible imagery of St. Paul. Considered simply in\r\n     itself, the description of the Christian's armour is one of the\r\n     most striking passages in the sacred volume. But if we view it in\r\n     connection with the circumstances with which the Apostle was\r\n     surrounded, we find a new and living emphasis in his enumeration of\r\n     all the parts of the heavenly panoply,--the belt of sincerity and\r\n     truth, with which the loins are girded for the spiritual war,--the\r\n     breast-plate of that righteousness, the inseparable links whereof\r\n     are faith and love,--the strong sandals, with which the feet of\r\n     Christ's soldiers are made ready, not for such errands of death and\r\n     despair as those on which the Prætorian soldiers were daily sent,\r\n     but for the universal message of the gospel of peace,--the large\r\n     shield of confident trust, wherewith the whole man is protected,\r\n     and whereon the fiery arrows of the Wicked One fall harmless and\r\n     dead,--the close-fitting helmet, with which the hope of salvation\r\n     invests the head of the believer,--and finally the sword of the\r\n     Spirit, the Word of God, which, when wielded by the Great Captain\r\n     of our Salvation, turned the tempter in the wilderness to flight,\r\n     while in the hands of His chosen Apostle (with whose memory the\r\n     sword seems inseparably associated), it became the means of\r\n     establishing Christianity on the earth.\r\n\r\n     \"All this imagery becomes doubly forcible if we remember that when\r\n     St. Paul wrote the words he was chained to a soldier, and in the\r\n     close neighbourhood of military sights and sounds. The appearance\r\n     of the Prætorian Guards was daily familiar to him; as his 'chains,'\r\n     on the other hand (so he tells us in the succeeding Epistle),\r\n     became well known throughout the whole _Prætorium_! (Phil. i. 13).\r\n     A difference of opinion has existed as to the precise meaning of\r\n     the word in this passage. Some have identified it, as in the\r\n     authorised version, with the house of Cæsar on the Palatine: more\r\n     commonly it has been supposed to mean that permanent camp of the\r\n     Prætorian Guards, which Tiberius established on the north of the\r\n     city, outside the walls. As regards the former opinion, it is true\r\n     that the word came to be used, almost as we use the word 'palace,'\r\n     for royal residences generally or for any residences of princely\r\n     splendour. Yet we never find the word employed for the imperial\r\n     house at Rome: and we believe the truer view to be that which has\r\n     been recently advocated, namely, that it denotes here, not the\r\n     palace itself, but the quarters of that part of the imperial\r\n     guards, which was in immediate attendance upon the emperor. The\r\n     emperor was _prætor_ or commander-in-chief of the troops, and it\r\n     was natural that his immediate guard should be in _prætorium_ near\r\n     him. It might, indeed, be argued that this military establishment\r\n     on the Palatine would cease to be necessary, when the Prætorian\r\n     camp was established: but the purpose of that establishment was to\r\n     concentrate near the city those cohorts, which had previously been\r\n     dispersed in other parts of Italy: a local body-guard near the\r\n     palace would not cease to be necessary: and Josephus, in his\r\n     account of the imprisonment of Agrippa, speaks of a 'camp' in\r\n     connection with the 'royal house.' Such we conceive to have been\r\n     the barrack immediately alluded to by St. Paul: though the\r\n     connection of these smaller quarters with the general camp was such\r\n     that he would naturally become known to '_all the rest_' of the\r\n     guards, as well as those who might for the time be connected with\r\n     the imperial household.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Paul tells us (in the Epistle to the Philippians) that\r\n     throughout the Prætorian quarter he was well known as a prisoner\r\n     for the cause of Christ, and he sends special salutations to the\r\n     Philippian Church from the Christians of the imperial household.\r\n     These notices bring before us very vividly the moral contrasts by\r\n     which the Apostle was surrounded. The soldier to whom he was\r\n     chained to-day might have been in Nero's body-guard yesterday; his\r\n     comrade who next relieved guard might have been one of the\r\n     executioners of Octavia, and might have carried her head to Poppæa\r\n     a few weeks before.\r\n\r\n     \"History has few stronger contrasts than when it shows us Paul\r\n     preaching Christ under the walls of Nero's palace. Thenceforward\r\n     there were but two religions in the Roman world; the worship of the\r\n     emperor, and the worship of the Saviour. The old superstitions had\r\n     long been worn out; they had lost all hold on educated minds....\r\n     Over against the altars of Nero and Poppæa, the voice of a prisoner\r\n     was daily heard, and daily woke in grovelling souls the\r\n     consciousness of their divine destiny. Men listened, and knew that\r\n     self-sacrifice was better than ease, humiliation more exalted than\r\n     pride, to suffer nobler than to reign. They felt that the only\r\n     religion which satisfied the needs of man was the religion of\r\n     sorrow, the religion of self-devotion, the religion of the\r\n     cross.\"--_Conybeare and Howson._\r\n\r\nHence, we may ascend through some gardens beneath the Villa Mills, to\r\nthe terrace which surmounts the grand ruins at the end of the Palace of\r\nthe Cæsars, supposed to be remains of the _Palace of Nero_, but as no\r\ninscriptions have been discovered, no part of it can be identified.[149]\r\nThese are by far the most picturesque portions of the ruins, and few\r\ncompositions can be finer than those formed by the huge masses of\r\nstately brick arches, laden with a wealth of laurustinus, cytizus, and\r\nother flowering shrubs, standing out against the soft hues and delicate\r\nblue and pink shadows of the distant Campagna. Beneath the terrace is a\r\nfine range of lofty chambers, with a broken statue at the end, through\r\nwhich there is a striking view. One of these ruined halls has been\r\nconverted into a kind of museum of architectural fragments found in this\r\npart of the palace, many of them of great beauty. This was the portion\r\nof the palace which longest remained entire, and which was inhabited by\r\nHeraclius in the seventh century. Some consider that these ruins were\r\nincorporated into the\r\n\r\n_Septizonium of Severus_, so called from its seven stories of building,\r\nerected A.D. 198, and finally destroyed by Sixtus V., who carried off\r\nits materials for the building of St Peter's. It was erected by Severus\r\nat the southern corner of the palace, in order that it might at once\r\nstrike the eyes of his African compatriots,[150] on their arrival in\r\nRome. He built two other edifices which he called Septizonium, one on\r\nthe Esquiline near the baths of Titus, and the other on the Via Appia,\r\nwhich he intended as the burial-place of his family, and where his son\r\nGeta was actually interred.\r\n\r\nThe remaining ruins on this division of the hill, supposed to be those\r\nof a theatre, a library, &c., have not yet been historically identified.\r\nThey probably belong to the _Palace of Domitian_ (Imp. A.D. 81--96), who\r\nadded largely to the buildings on the Palatine. The magnificence of his\r\npalace is extolled in the inflated verses of Statius, who describes the\r\nimperial dwelling as exciting the jealousy of the abode of Jupiter--as\r\nlosing itself amongst the stars by its height, and rising above the\r\nclouds into the full splendour of the sunshine! Such was the\r\nextravagance displayed by Domitian in these buildings, that Plutarch\r\ncompares him to Midas, who wished everything to be made of gold. This\r\nwas the scene of many of the tyrannical vagaries of Domitian.\r\n\r\n     \"'Having once made a great feast for the citizens, he proposed,'\r\n     says Dion, 'to follow it up with an entertainment to a select\r\n     number of the highest nobility. He fitted up an apartment all in\r\n     black. The ceiling was black, the walls were black, the pavement\r\n     was black, and upon it were ranged rows of bare stone seats, black\r\n     also. The guests were introduced at night without their attendants,\r\n     and each might see at the head of his couch a column placed, like a\r\n     tomb-stone, on which his own name was graven, with the cresset lamp\r\n     above it, such as is suspended in the tombs. Presently there\r\n     entered a troop of naked boys, blackened, who danced around with\r\n     horrid movements, and then stood still before them, offering them\r\n     the fragments of food which are commonly presented to the dead. The\r\n     guests were paralysed with terror, expecting at every moment to be\r\n     put to death; and the more, as the others maintained a deep\r\n     silence, as though they were dead themselves, and Domitian spake of\r\n     things pertaining to the state of the departed only.' But this\r\n     funeral feast was not destined to end tragically. Cæsar happened to\r\n     be in a sportive mood, and when he had sufficiently enjoyed his\r\n     jest, and had sent his visitors home expecting worse to follow, he\r\n     bade each to be presented with the silver cup and platter on which\r\n     his dismal supper had been served, and with the slave, now neatly\r\n     washed and apparelled, who had waited upon him. Such, said the\r\n     populace, was the way in which it pleased the emperor to solemnise\r\n     the funereal banquet of the victims of his defeats in Dacia, and of\r\n     his persecutions in the city.\"--_Merivale_, ch. lxii.\r\n\r\nIt was in this palace that the murder of Domitian took place:\r\n\r\n     \"Of the three great deities, the august assessors in the Capitol,\r\n     Minerva was regarded by Domitian as his special patroness. Her\r\n     image stood by his bedside: his customary oath was by her divinity.\r\n     But now a dream apprised him that the guardian of his person was\r\n     disarmed by the guardian of the empire, and that Jupiter had\r\n     forbidden his daughter to protect her favourite any longer. Scared\r\n     by these horrors he lost all self-control, and petulantly cried,\r\n     and the cry was itself a portent: 'Now strike Jove whom he will!'\r\n     From supernatural terrors he reverted again and again to earthly\r\n     fears and suspicions. Henceforward the tyrant allowed none to be\r\n     admitted to his presence without being previously searched; and he\r\n     caused the ends of the corridor in which he took exercise to be\r\n     lined with polished marble, to reflect the image of any one behind\r\n     him; at the same time he inquired anxiously into the horoscope of\r\n     every chief whom he might fear as a possible rival or successor.\r\n\r\n     \"The victim of superstition had long since, it was said,\r\n     ascertained too surely the year, the day, the hour which should\r\n     prove fatal to him. He had learnt too that he was to die by the\r\n     sword.... The omens were now closing about the victim, and his\r\n     terrors became more importunate and overwhelming. 'Something,' he\r\n     exclaimed, 'is about to happen, which men shall talk of all the\r\n     world over.' Drawing a drop of blood from a pimple on his forehead,\r\n     'May this be all,' he added. His attendants, to reassure him,\r\n     declared that the hour had passed. Embracing the flattering tale\r\n     with alacrity, and rushing at once to the extreme of confidence, he\r\n     announced that the danger was over, and that he would bathe and\r\n     dress for the evening repast. But the danger was just then ripening\r\n     within the walls of the palace. The mysteries there enacted few,\r\n     indeed, could penetrate, and the account of Domitian's fall has\r\n     been coloured by invention and fancy. The story that a child, whom\r\n     he suffered to attend in his private chamber, found by chance the\r\n     tablets which he had placed under his pillow, and that the empress,\r\n     on inspecting them, and finding herself, with his most familiar\r\n     servants, designated for execution, contrived a plot for his\r\n     assassination, is one so often repeated as to cause great\r\n     suspicion. But neither can we accept the version of Philostratus,\r\n     who would have us believe that the murder of Domitian was the deed\r\n     of a single traitor, a freedman of Clemens, named Stephanus, who,\r\n     indignant at his patron's death, and urged to fury by the sentence\r\n     on his patron's wife, Domitilla, rushed alone into the tyrant's\r\n     chamber, diverted his attention with a frivolous pretext, and smote\r\n     him with the sword he bore concealed in his sleeve. It is more\r\n     likely that the design, however it originated, was common to\r\n     several of the household, and that means were taken among them to\r\n     disarm the victim, and baffle his cries for assistance. Stephanus,\r\n     who is said to have excelled in personal strength, may have been\r\n     employed to deal the blow; for not more, perhaps, than one\r\n     attendant would be admitted at once into the presence. Struck in\r\n     the groin, but not mortally, Domitian snatched at his own weapon,\r\n     but found the sword removed from its scabbard. He then clutched the\r\n     assassin's dagger, cutting his own fingers to the bone; then\r\n     desperately thrust the bloody talons into the eyes of his\r\n     assailant, and beat his head with a golden goblet, shrieking all\r\n     the time for help. Thereupon in rushed Parthenius, Maximus, and\r\n     others, and despatched him as he lay writhing on the\r\n     pavement.\"--_Merivale_, ch. lxii.\r\n\r\nTrajan stripped the palace of his predecessors of all its ornaments to\r\nadorn the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus,[151] but it was restored by\r\nCommodus, after a fire which occurred in his reign,[152] and enriched by\r\nHeliogabalus,[153] and almost every succeeding emperor, till the time of\r\nTheodoric.[154]\r\n\r\n    \"'Brickwork I found thee, and marble I left thee!' their Emperor vaunted;\r\n    'Marble I thought thee, and brickwork I find thee!' the Tourist may\r\n     answer.\"\r\n\r\n    _A. H. Clough._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE CŒLIAN.\r\n\r\n     S. Gregorio--S. Giovanni e Paolo--Arch of Dolabella--S. Tommaso in\r\n     Formis--Villa Mattei--Sta. Maria della Navicella--S. Stefano\r\n     Rotondo--I Santi Quattro Incoronati--S. Clemente.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cœlian Hill extends from St. John Lateran to the Vigna of the\r\nPorta Capena, and from the Fountain of Egeria to the Convent of S.\r\nGregorio. It is now entirely uninhabited, except by monks of the\r\nCamaldolese, Passionist, and Redemptorist Orders, and by the Augustinian\r\nNuns of the Incoronati.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest times the name of this hill was Mons Querquetulanus,\r\n\"The Hill of Oaks,\" and it was clothed with forest, part of which long\r\nremained as the sacred wood of the Camenæ. It first received its name of\r\nCœlius from Cœlius Vibenna, an Etruscan Lucumo of Ardea, who is\r\nsaid to have come to the assistance of Romulus in his war against the\r\nSabine king Tatius, and to have afterwards established himself here. In\r\nthe reign of Tullus Hostilius the Cœlian assumed some importance, as\r\nthat king fixed his residence here, and transported hither the Latin\r\npopulation of Alba.\r\n\r\nAs the Cœlian had a less prominent share in the history of Rome than\r\nany of the other hills, it preserves scarcely any historical monuments\r\nof pagan times. All those which existed under the republic were\r\ndestroyed by a great fire which ravaged this hill in the reign of\r\nTiberius,[155] except the Temple of the Nymphs, which once stood in the\r\ngrove of the Camenæ, and which had been already burnt by Clodius, in\r\norder to destroy the records of his falsehoods and debts which it\r\ncontained.[156] Some small remains in the garden of the Passionist\r\nconvent are attributed to the temple which Agrippina raised to her\r\nhusband the Emperor Claudius, and in S. Stefano Rotondo some antiquaries\r\nrecognize the Macellum of Nero. There are no remains of the palace of\r\nthe Emperor Tetricus, who lived here, \"between the two sacred\r\ngroves,\"[157] in a magnificent captivity under Aurelian, whom he\r\nreceived here at a banquet, at which he exhibited an allegorical picture\r\nrepresenting his reception of the empire of Gaul, and his subsequent\r\nresignation of it for the simple insignia of a Roman senator.[158]\r\n\r\nTo the Christian visitor, however, the Cœlian will always prove of\r\nthe deepest interest--and the slight thread of connection which runs\r\nbetween all its principal objects, as well as their nearness to one\r\nanother, brings them pleasantly within the limits of a single day's\r\nexcursion. Many of those who are not mere passing visitors at Rome, will\r\nprobably find that their chief pleasure lies not amid the well-known\r\nsights of the great basilicas and palaces, but in quiet walks through\r\nthe silent lanes and amid the decaying buildings of these more distant\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n     \"The recollection of Rome will come back, after many years, in\r\n     images of long delicious strolls, in musing loneliness, through the\r\n     deserted ways of the ancient city; of climbing among its hills,\r\n     over ruins, to reach some vantage-ground for mapping out the\r\n     subjacent territory, and looking beyond on the glorious chains of\r\n     greater and lesser mountains, clad in their imperial hues of gold\r\n     and purple; and then, perhaps, of solemn entrance into the cool\r\n     solitude of an open basilica, where your thought now rests, as your\r\n     body then did, after the silent evening prayer, and brings forward\r\n     from many well-remembered nooks, every local inscription, every\r\n     lovely monument of art, the characteristic feature of each, or the\r\n     great names with which it is associated. The Liberian speaks to you\r\n     of Bethlehem and its treasured mysteries; the Sessorian of Calvary\r\n     and its touching relics. Baronius gives you his injunctions on\r\n     Christian architecture inscribed, as a legacy, in his title of\r\n     Fasciola; St. Dominic lives in the fresh paintings of a faithful\r\n     disciple, on the walls of the opposite church of St. Xystus; there\r\n     stands the chair and there hangs the hat of St. Charles, as if he\r\n     had just left his own church, from which he calls himself in his\r\n     signature to letters 'the Cardinal of St. Praxedes;' near it, in a\r\n     sister church, is fresh the memory of St. Justin Martyr, addressing\r\n     his apologies for Christianity to heathen emperor and senate, and\r\n     of Pudens and his British spouse; and, far beyond the city gates,\r\n     the cheerful Philip[159] is seen kneeling at S. Sebastiano, waiting\r\n     for the door to the Platonia to be opened for him, that he may\r\n     watch the night through in the martyr's dormitory.\"--_Wiseman's\r\n     Life of Leo XII._\r\n\r\n     \"For myself, I must say that I know nothing to compare with a\r\n     pilgrimage among the antique churches scattered over the Esquiline,\r\n     the Cœlian, and the Aventine Hills. They stand apart, each in\r\n     its solitude, amid gardens, and vineyards, and heaps of nameless\r\n     ruins;--here a group of cypresses, there a lofty pine or solitary\r\n     palm; the tutelary saint, perhaps some Sant' Achilleo, or Santa\r\n     Bibiana, whom we never heard of before,--an altar rich in precious\r\n     marbles,--columns of porphyry,--the old frescoes dropping from the\r\n     walls,--the everlasting colossal mosaics looking down so solemn, so\r\n     dim, so spectral;--these grow upon us, until at each succeeding\r\n     visit they themselves, and the associations by which they are\r\n     surrounded, become a part of our daily life, and may be said to\r\n     hallow that daily life when considered in a right spirit. True,\r\n     what is most sacred, what is most poetical, is often desecrated to\r\n     the fancy by the intrusion of those prosaic realities which easily\r\n     strike prosaic minds; by disgust at the foolish fabrications which\r\n     those who recite them do not believe, by lying inscriptions, by\r\n     tawdry pictures, by tasteless and even profane restorations;--by\r\n     much that saddens, much that offends, much that disappoints;--but\r\n     then so much remains! So much to awaken, to elevate, to touch the\r\n     heart; so much that will not pass away from the memory, so much\r\n     that makes a part of our after-life.\"--_Mrs. Jameson._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may pass under the Arch of Constantine, or through the pleasant sunny\r\nwalks known as the _Parco di San Gregorio_,--planted by the French\r\nduring their first occupation of Rome, but which may almost be regarded\r\nas a remnant of the sacred grove of the Camenæ which once occupied this\r\nsite.\r\n\r\nThe further gate of the Parco opens on a small triangular piazza, whence\r\na broad flight of steps lead up to the _Church of S. Gregorio_, to the\r\nEnglish pilgrim one of the most interesting spots in Rome, for it was at\r\nthe head of these steps that St. Augustine took his last farewell of\r\nGregory the Great, and, kneeling on this green-sward below, the first\r\nmissionaries of England received the parting blessing of the great\r\npontiff, as he stood on the height in the gateway. As we enter the\r\nportico (built 1633, by Card. Scipio Borghese,) we see on either side\r\ntwo world-famous inscriptions.\r\n\r\nOn the right:\r\n\r\n            Adsta hospes\r\n              et lege.\r\n    Hic olim fuit M.

Par ces degrés sont descendus les quarante moines\r\n     qui ont porté à l'Angleterre la parole de Dieu, la lumière de\r\n     l'Évangile, la succession apostolique et la règle de\r\n     Saint-Benoît!\"--_Montalembert, Moines d'Occident._\r\n\r\nHard by was the house of Sta. Silvia, mother of St. Gregory, of which\r\nthe ruins still remain, opposite to the church of S. Giovanni e Paolo,\r\nand in the little garden which still exists, we may believe that he\r\nplayed as a child under his mother's care. Close to his mother's home he\r\nfounded the monastery of St. Andrew, where he dwelt for many years as a\r\nmonk, employed in writing homilies, and in the enjoyment of visionary\r\nconversation with the Virgin, whom he believed to answer him in person\r\nfrom her picture before which he knelt. \"To this monastery he presented\r\nhis own portrait, with those of his father and mother, which were\r\nprobably in existence 300 years after his death; and this portrait of\r\nhimself probably furnished that peculiar type of physiognomy which we\r\ntrace in all the best representations of him.\"[160] During the life of\r\npenance and poverty which was led here by St. Gregory, he sold all his\r\ngoods for the benefit of the poor, retaining nothing but a silver bason\r\ngiven him by his mother. One day a poor shipwrecked sailor came several\r\ntimes to beg in the cell where he was writing, and as he had no money,\r\nhe gave him instead this one remaining treasure. A long time after, St.\r\nGregory saw the same shipwrecked sailor reappear in the form of his\r\nguardian angel, who told him that God had henceforth destined him to\r\nrule his church, and become the successor of St. Peter, whose charity he\r\nhad imitated.[161]\r\n\r\n     \"Un moine (A.D. 590) va monter pour la première fois sur la chaire\r\n     apostolique. Ce moine, le plus illustre de tous ceux qui ont compté\r\n     parmi les souverains pontifes, y rayonnera d'un éclat qu'aucun de\r\n     ses prédécesseurs n'a égalé et qui rejaillera comme une sanction\r\n     suprême, sur l'institut dont il est issu. Grégoire, le seul parmi\r\n     les hommes avec le Pape Léon Ier qui ait reçu à la fois, du\r\n     consentement universel, le double surnom de Saint et de Grand, sera\r\n     l'eternel honneur de l'Ordre bénédictin comme de la papauté. Par\r\n     son génie, mais surtout par le charme et l'ascendant de sa vertu,\r\n     il organisera le domaine temporel des papes, il développera et\r\n     régularisera leur souveraineté spirituelle, il fondera leur\r\n     paternelle suprématie sur les royautés naissantes et les nations\r\n     nouvelles qui vont devenir les grands peuples de l'avenir, et\r\n     s'appeler la France, l'Espagne, l'Angleterre. A vrai dire, c'est\r\n     lui qui inaugure le moyen âge, la société moderne et la\r\n     civilisation chrétienne.\"--_Montalembert._\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Gregory is approached by a cloistered court filled\r\nwith monuments. On the left is that of Sir Edward Carne, one of the\r\ncommissioners to obtain the opinion of foreign universities respecting\r\nthe divorce of Henry VIII. from Catherine of Arragon, ambassador to\r\nCharles V., and afterwards to the court of Rome. He was recalled when\r\nthe embassy was suppressed by Elizabeth, but was kept at Rome by Paul\r\nIV., who had conceived a great affection for him, and he died here in\r\n1561. Another monument, of an exile for the catholic faith, is that of\r\nRobert Pecham, who died 1567, inscribed:\r\n\r\n     \"Roberto Pecham Anglo, equite aurato, Philippi et Mariæ Angliæ et\r\n     Hispan regibus olim a consiliis genere religione virtute præclaro\r\n     qui cum patriam suam a fede catholica deficientem adspicere sine\r\n     summo dolore non posset, relictis omnibus quæ in hac vita carissima\r\n     esse solent, in voluntarium profectus exilium, post sex annis\r\n     pauperibus Christi heredibus testamento institutis, sanctissime e\r\n     vita migravit.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Church_, rebuilt in 1734, under Francesco Ferrari, has sixteen\r\nancient granite columns and a fine Opus-Alexandrinum pavement. Among its\r\nmonuments we may observe that of Cardinal Zurla, a learned writer on\r\ngeographical subjects, who was abbot of the adjoining convent. It was a\r\ncurious characteristic of the laxity of morals in the time of Julius II.\r\n(1503-13), that her friends did not hesitate to bury the famous Aspasia\r\nof that age in this church, and to inscribe upon her tomb: \"Imperia,\r\ncortisana Romana, quæ digna tanto nomine, raræ inter homines formæ\r\nspecimen dedit. Vixit annos xxvi. dies xii. obiit 1511, die 15\r\nAugusti,\"--but this monument has now been removed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the right aisle is a picture by _Badalocchi_,\r\ncommemorating a miracle on this spot, when, at the moment of elevation,\r\nthe Host is said to have bled in the hands of St. Gregory, to convince\r\nan unbeliever of the truth of transubstantiation. It will be observed\r\nthat in this and in most other representations of St. Gregory, a dove is\r\nperched upon his shoulder, and whispering into his ear. This is\r\ncommemorative of the impression that every word and act of the saint was\r\ndirectly inspired by the Holy Ghost; a belief first engendered by the\r\nhappy promptitude of Peter, his arch-deacon, who invented the story to\r\nsave the beloved library of his master which was about to be destroyed\r\nafter his death by the people, in a pitiful spirit of revenge, because\r\nthey fancied that a famine which was decimating them, had been brought\r\nabout by the extravagance of Gregory.[162] An altar beneath this picture\r\nis decorated with marble reliefs, representing the same miracle, and\r\nalso the story of the soul of the Emperor Trajan being freed from\r\npurgatory by the intercession of Gregory. (Chap. IV.)\r\n\r\nA low door near this leads into the monastic cell of St. Gregory,\r\ncontaining his marble chair, and the spot where his bed lay, inscribed:\r\n\r\n    \"Nocte dieque vigil longo hic defessu labore\r\n      Gregorius modica membra quiete levat.\"\r\n\r\nHere also an immense collection of minute relics of saints are exposed\r\nto the veneration of the credulous.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the church is the _Salviati Chapel_, the\r\nburial-place of that noble family, modernized in 1690 by Carlo Maderno.\r\nOver the altar is a copy of Annibale Caracci's picture of St. Gregory,\r\nwhich once existed here, but is now in England. On the right is the\r\npicture of the Madonna, \"which spoke to St. Gregory,\" and which is said\r\nto have become suddenly impressed upon the wall after a vision in which\r\nshe appeared to him;--on the left is a beautiful marble ciborium.\r\n\r\nHence a sacristan will admit the visitor into the _Garden of Sta.\r\nSilvia_, whence there is a grand view over the opposite Palatine.\r\n\r\n     \"To stand here on the summit of the flight of steps which leads to\r\n     the portal, and look across to the ruined Palace of the Cæsars,\r\n     makes the mind giddy with the rush of thoughts. _There_, before us,\r\n     the Palatine Hill--pagan Rome in the dust; _here_, the little cell,\r\n     a few feet square, where slept in sackcloth the man who gave the\r\n     last blow to the power of the Cæsars, and first set his foot as\r\n     sovereign on the cradle and capital of their greatness.\"--_Mrs.\r\n     Jameson._\r\n\r\nHere are three Chapels, restored by the historian Cardinal Baronius, in\r\nthe sixteenth century. The first, of _Sta. Silvia_, contains a fresco of\r\nthe Almighty with a choir of angels, by _Guido_, and beneath it a\r\nbeautiful statue of the venerable saint (especially invoked against\r\nconvulsions), by _Niccolo Cordieri_--one of the best statues of saints\r\nin Rome. The second chapel, of _St. Andrew_, contains the two famous\r\nrival frescoes of _Guido_ and _Domenichino_. Guido has represented St.\r\nAndrew kneeling in reverent thankfulness at first sight of the cross on\r\nwhich he was to suffer; Domenichino--a more painful subject--the\r\nflagellation of the saint. Of these paintings Annibale Caracci observed\r\nthat \"Guido's was the painting of the Master; but Domenichino's the\r\npainting of the scholar who knew more than the master.\" The beautiful\r\ngroup of figures in the corner, where a terrified child is hiding its\r\nface in its mother's dress, is introduced in several other pictures of\r\nDomenichino.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a well-known anecdote that a poor old woman stood for a long\r\n     time before the story of Domenichino, pointing it out bit by bit\r\n     and explaining it to a child who was with her,--and that she then\r\n     turned to the story told by Guido, admired the landscape, and went\r\n     away. It is added that when Annibale Caracci heard of this, it\r\n     seemed to him in itself a sufficient reason for giving the\r\n     preference to the former work. It is also said that when\r\n     Domenichino was painting one of the executioners, he worked himself\r\n     up into a fury with threatening words and gestures, and that\r\n     Annibale, surprising him in this condition, embraced him, saying:\r\n     'Domenico, to-day you have taught me a lesson, which is that a\r\n     painter, like an orator, must first feel himself that which he\r\n     would represent to others.'\"--_Lanzi_, v. 82.\r\n\r\n     \"In historical pictures Domenichino is often cold and studied,\r\n     especially in the principal subject, while on the other hand, the\r\n     subordinate persons have much grace, and a noble character of\r\n     beauty. Thus, in the scourging of St. Andrew, a group of women\r\n     thrust back by the executioners is of the highest beauty. Guido's\r\n     fresco is of high merit--St. Andrew, on his way to execution, sees\r\n     the cross before him in the distance, and falls upon his knees in\r\n     adoration,--the executioners and spectators regard him with\r\n     astonishment.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nThe third chapel, of _Sta. Barbara_, contains a grand statue of St.\r\nGregory by _Niccolo Cordieri_[163] (where the whispering dove is again\r\nrepresented), and the table at which he daily fed twelve poor pilgrims\r\nafter washing their feet. The Roman breviary tells how on one occasion\r\nan angel appeared at the feast as the thirteenth guest. This story,--the\r\nsending forth of St. Augustine,--and other events of St. Gregory's life,\r\nare represented in rude frescoes upon the walls by _Viviani_.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining _Convent_ (modern) is of vast size, and is now occupied by\r\nCamaldolese monks, though in the time of St. Gregory it belonged to the\r\nBenedictines. In its situation it is beautiful and quiet, and must have\r\nbeen so even in the time of St. Gregory, who often regretted the\r\nseclusion which he was compelled to quit.\r\n\r\n     \"Un jour, plus accablé que jamais par le poids des affaires\r\n     séculières, il s'était retiré dans un lieu secret pour s'y livrer\r\n     dans un long silence à sa tristesse, et y fut rejoint par le\r\n     diàcre Pierre, son élève, son ami d'enfance et le compagnon de ses\r\n     chères études. 'Vous est-il donc arrivé quelque chagrin nouveau,'\r\n     lui dit le jeune homme, 'pour que vous soyez ainsi plus triste qu'à\r\n     l'ordinaire.' 'Mon chagrin,' lui répondit le pontife, 'est celui de\r\n     tous mes jours, toujours vieux par l'usage, et toujours nouveau par\r\n     sa croissance quotidienne. Ma pauvre âme se rappelle ce qu'elle\r\n     était autrefois, dans notre monastère, quand elle planait sur tout\r\n     ce qui passe, sur tout ce qui change; quand elle ne songeait qu'au\r\n     ciel; quand elle franchissait par la contemplation le cloître de ce\r\n     corps qui l'enserre; quand elle aimait d'avance la mort comme\r\n     l'entrée de la vie. Et maintenant il lui faut, à cause de ma charge\r\n     pastorale, supporter les mille affaires des hommes du siècle et se\r\n     souiller dans cette poussière. Et quand, après s'être ainsi\r\n     répandue au dehors, elle veut retrouver sa retraite intérieure,\r\n     elle n'y revient qu'amoindrie. Je médite sur tout ce que je souffre\r\n     et sur tout ce que j'ai perdu. Me voici, battu par l'océan et tout\r\n     brisé par la tempête; quand je pense à ma vie d'autrefois, il me\r\n     semble regarder en arrière vers le rivage. Et ce qu'il y a de plus\r\n     triste, c'est qu'ainsi ballotté par l'orage, je puis à peine\r\n     entrevoir le port que j'ai quitté.'\"--_Montalembert, Moines\r\n     d'Occident._\r\n\r\nPope Gregory XVI. was for some years abbot of this convent, to which he\r\nwas afterwards a generous benefactor;--regretting always, like his great\r\npredecessor, the peace of his monastic life. His last words to his\r\ncardinals, who were imploring him, for political purposes, to conceal\r\nhis danger, were singularly expressive of this--\"Per Dio\r\nlasciatemi!--voglio morire da frate, non da sovrano.\" The last great\r\nceremony enacted at S. Gregorio was when Cardinal Wiseman consecrated\r\nthe mitred abbot of English Cistercians,--Dr. Manning preaching at the\r\nsame time on the prospects of English Catholicism.\r\n\r\nAscending the steep paved lane between S. Gregorio and the Parco, the\r\npicturesque church on the left with the arcaded apse and tall campanile\r\n(_c._ A.D. 1206), inlaid with coloured tiles and marbles, is that of\r\n_SS. Giovanni e Paolo_, two officers in the household of the Christian\r\nprincess Constantia, daughter of the Emperor Constantine, in whose time\r\nthey occupied a position of great influence and trust. When Julian the\r\nApostate came to the throne, he attempted to persuade them to sacrifice\r\nto idols, but they refused, saying, \"Our lives are at the disposal of\r\nthe emperor, but our souls and our faith belong to our God.\" Then\r\nJulian, fearing to bring them to public martyrdom, lest their popularity\r\nshould cause a rebellion and the example of their well-known fortitude\r\nbe an encouragement to others, sent off soldiers to behead them\r\nprivately in their own house. Hence the inscription on the spot, \"Locus\r\nmartyrii SS. Joannis et Paoli in ædibus propriis.\" The church was built\r\nby Pammachus, the friend of St. Jerome, on the site of the house of the\r\nsaints. It is entered by a portico adorned with eight ancient granite\r\ncolumns, interesting as having been erected by the English pope,\r\nNicholas Breakspear, A.D. 1158. The interior, in the basilica form, has\r\nsixteen ancient columns and a beautiful Opus-Alexandrinum pavement. In\r\nthe centre of the floor is a stone, railed off, upon which it is said\r\nthat the saints were beheaded. Their bodies are contained in a porphyry\r\nurn under the high altar. In early times these were the only bodies of\r\nsaints preserved within the walls of Rome (the rest being in the\r\ncatacombs). In the Sacramentary of St. Leo, in the Preface of SS. John\r\nand Paul, it is said, \"Of Thy merciful providence Thou hast vouchsafed\r\nto crown not only the circuit of the city with the glorious passions of\r\nthe martyrs, but also to hide in the very heart of the city itself the\r\nvictorious limbs of St. John and St. Paul.\"[164]\r\n\r\nAbove the tribune are frescoes by _Pomerancio_. A splendid chapel on the\r\nright was built 1868;--two of its alabaster pillars were the gift of\r\nPius IX. Beneath the altar on the left of the tribune is preserved the\r\nembalmed body of St. Paul of the Cross (who died 1776), founder of the\r\nOrder of Passionists, who inhabit the adjoining convent. The aged face\r\nbears a beautiful expression of repose;--the body is dressed in the robe\r\nwhich clothed it when living.[165]\r\n\r\nMale visitors are admitted through the convent to its large and\r\nbeautiful _Garden_, which overhangs the steep side of the Cœlian\r\ntowards the Coliseum, of which there is a fine view between its ancient\r\ncypresses. Here, on a site near the monastery, are some remains believed\r\nto be those of the temple built by Agrippina (_c._ A.D. 57), daughter of\r\nGermanicus, to the honour of her deified husband (and uncle) Claudius,\r\nafter she had sent him to Olympus by feeding him with poisonous\r\nmushrooms. This temple was pulled down by Nero, who wished to efface the\r\nmemory of his predecessor, on the pretext that it interfered with his\r\nGolden House; but was rebuilt under Vespasian. In this garden also is\r\nthe entrance to the vast substructions known as the _Vivarium_, whence\r\nthe wild beasts who devoured the early Christian martyrs were frightened\r\nby burning tow down a subterranean passage into the arena.\r\n\r\nThe famous Church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo at Venice was founded by\r\nemigrants from this convent. The memory of these saints was so much\r\nhonoured up to the time of Pope Gregory the Great, that the eve of their\r\nfestival was an obligatory fast. Their fête (June 26) is still kept with\r\ngreat solemnities on the Cœlian, when the railing round their place\r\nof execution is wreathed and laden with flowers. When the \"station\" is\r\nheld at their church, the apse is illuminated.\r\n\r\nContinuing to follow the lane up the Cœlian, we reach the richly\r\ntinted brick _Arch of Dolabella_, erected, A.D. 10, by the consuls P.\r\nCornelius Dolabella and Caius Julius Silanus. Nero, building his\r\naqueduct to the palace of the Cæsars, made use of this, which already\r\nexisted, and included it in his line of arches.\r\n\r\nAbove the arch is a _Hermitage_, revered as that where S. Giovanni di\r\nMatha lived, and where he died in 1213. Before he came to reside here he\r\nhad been miraculously brought from Tunis (whither he had gone on a\r\nmission) to Ostia, in a boat without helm or sail, in which he knelt\r\nwithout ceasing before the crucifix throughout the whole of his voyage!\r\n\r\nPassing beneath the gateway, we emerge upon the picturesque irregular\r\nPiazza of the Navicella, the central point of the Cœlian, which is\r\nsurrounded by a most interesting group of buildings, and which contains\r\nan isolated fragment of the aqueduct of Nero, dear to artists from its\r\ncolour. Behind this, under the trees, is the little marble _Navicella_,\r\nwhich is supposed to have been originally a votive offering of a sailor\r\nto Jupiter Redux, whose temple stood near this; but which was adapted by\r\nLeo X. as a Christian emblem of the Church,--the boat of St. Peter.\r\n\r\n     \"The allegory of a ship is peculiarly dwelt upon by the ancient\r\n     Fathers. A ship entering the port was a favourite heathen emblem of\r\n     the close of life. But the Christian idea, and its elevation from\r\n     individual to universal or catholic humanity, is derived directly\r\n     from the Bible,--see, for instance, I Peter iii. 20, 21. 'Without\r\n     doubt,' says St. Augustine, 'the ark is the figure of the city of\r\n     God pilgrimising in this world, in other words, of the Church,\r\n     which is saved by the wood on which hung the mediator between God\r\n     and man, the man Christ Jesus.' The same interpretation was\r\n     recognised in the Latin Church in the days of Tertullian and St.\r\n     Cyprian, &c. The bark of St. Peter is similarly represented on a\r\n     Greek gem, found in the Catacombs, as sailing on a fish, probably\r\n     Leviathan or Satan, while doves, emblematical of the faithful,\r\n     perch on the mast and stern,--two Apostles row, a third lifts up\r\n     his hands in prayer, and our Saviour, approaching the vessel,\r\n     supports Peter by the hand when about to sink.... But the allegory\r\n     of the ship is carried out to its fullest extent in the\r\n     fifty-seventh chapter of the second book of the 'Apostolical\r\n     Constitutions,' supposed to have been compiled in the name of the\r\n     Apostles, in the fourth century.\"--_Lord Lindsay's Christian Art_,\r\n     i. 18.\r\n\r\nOn the right is (first) the gateway of the deserted convent of\r\nRedemptorists, called _S. Tommaso in Formis_, which was founded by S.\r\nGiovanni de Matha, who, when celebrating his first mass at Paris, beheld\r\nin a vision, an angel robed in white, with a red and blue cross upon his\r\nbreast, and his hands resting in benediction upon the heads of two\r\ncaptives,--a white and a black man. The bishop of Paris sent him to Rome\r\nto seek explanation from Innocent III., who was celebrated as an\r\ninterpreter of dreams,--his foundation of the Franciscan order having\r\nresulted from one which befell him. S. Giovanni was accompanied to the\r\npope by another hermit, Felix de Valois. They found that Innocent had\r\nhimself seen the same vision of the angel between the two captives while\r\ncelebrating mass at the Lateran, and he interpreted it as inculcating\r\nthe duty of charity towards Christian slaves, for which purpose he\r\nfounded the Trinitarians, since called Redemptorists. The story of the\r\ndouble vision is commemorated in a _Mosaic_, erected above the door,\r\nA.D. 1260, and bearing the name of the artist, Jacobus Cosmati.\r\n\r\nThe next gate beyond the church is that of the _Villa Mattei_, the\r\ngarden of the Redemptorists. (The villa is now the property of Baron\r\nRichard Hoffmann: visitors are generally admitted upon writing down\r\ntheir names at the gate.)\r\n\r\nThese grounds are well worth visiting--quite the ideal of a deserted\r\nRoman garden, a wealth of large Roman daisies, roses, and periwinkle\r\nspreading at will amid remains of ancient statues and columns. A grand\r\nlittle avenue of ilexes leads to a terrace whence there is a most\r\nbeautiful view towards the aqueducts and the Alban Hills, with a noble\r\nsarcophagus and a quantity of fine aloes and prickly-pears in the\r\nforeground. There is an obelisk, of which only the top is Egyptian. It\r\nis said that there is a man's hand underneath;--when the obelisk was\r\nlowered it fell suddenly, and one of the workmen had not time to take\r\nhis hand away. In the grounds annexed to the lower part of the villa is\r\nthe Fountain of Egeria (p. 375).\r\n\r\nAlmost standing in the garden of the villa, and occupying the site of\r\nthe house of Sta. Cyriaca, is the _Church of Sta. Maria in Domenica_ or\r\n_della Navicella_. (If no one is here, the hermit at S. Stefano Rotondo\r\nwill unlock it.) The portico is due to Raphael (his design is at\r\nWindsor). The damp interior (rebuilt by Leo X. from designs of Raphael)\r\nis solemn and striking. It is in the basilica form, the nave separated\r\nfrom the aisles by eighteen columns of granite and one (smaller, near\r\nthe tribune) of porphyry. The frieze, in chiaroscuro, was painted by\r\n_Giulio Romano_ and _Pierino del Vaga_. Beneath the confessional are\r\nthe bones of Sta. Balbina, whose fortress-like church stands on the\r\nPseudo-Aventine. In the tribune are curious mosaics, in which the figure\r\nof Pope Paschal I. is introduced, the square nimbus round his head being\r\nan evidence of its portrait character, _i. e._, that it was done during\r\nhis lifetime.[166]\r\n\r\n     \"Within the tribune are mosaics of the Virgin and Child seated on a\r\n     throne, with angels ranged in regular rows on each side; and, at\r\n     her feet, with unspeakable stiffness of limb, the kneeling figure\r\n     of Pope Paschal I. Upon the walls of the tribune is the Saviour\r\n     with a nimbus, surrounded with two angels and the twelve apostles,\r\n     and further below, on a much larger scale, two prophets, who appear\r\n     to point towards him. The most remarkable thing here is the rich\r\n     foliage decoration. Besides the wreaths of flowers (otherwise not a\r\n     rare feature) which are growing out of two vessels on the edge of\r\n     the dome, the floor beneath the figures is also decorated with\r\n     flowers--a graceful species of ornament seldom aimed at in the\r\n     moroseness of Byzantine art. From this point, the decline into\r\n     utter barbarism is rapid.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     \"The Olivetan monks inhabited the church and cloisters of Sta.\r\n     Maria in Domenica, commonly called in Navicella, from the rudely\r\n     sculptured marble monument that stands on the grass before its\r\n     portal, a remnant of bygone days, to which neither history nor\r\n     tradition has given a name, but which has itself given one to the\r\n     picturesque old church which stands on the brow of the Cœlian\r\n     Hill.\"--_Lady Georgiana Fullerton._\r\n\r\nA tradition of the Church narrates that St. Lorenzo, deacon and martyr,\r\ndaily distributed alms to the poor in front of this church--then the\r\nhouse of Sta. Cyriaca--with whom he had taken refuge.\r\n\r\nOpposite, is the round _Church of S. Stefano Rotondo_, dedicated by St.\r\nSimplicius in 467. It appears to have been built on the site of an\r\nancient circular building, and to have belonged to the great victual\r\nmarket--Macellum Magnum--erected by Nero in this quarter.[167] It is\r\nseldom used for service, except on St. Stephen's Day (December 26), but\r\nvisitors are admitted through a little cloister, in which stands a well\r\nof beautiful proportions, of temp. Leo X.--attributed to Michael Angelo.\r\nThe interior is exceedingly curious architecturally. It is one hundred\r\nand thirty-three feet in diameter, with a double circle of granite\r\ncolumns, thirty-six in the outer and twenty in the inner series,\r\nenclosing two tall Corinthian columns, with two pilasters supporting a\r\ncross wall. In the centre is a kind of temple in which are relics of St.\r\nStephen (his body is said to be at S. Lorenzo). In the entrance of the\r\nchurch is an ancient marble seat from which St. Gregory is said to have\r\nread his fourth homily.\r\n\r\nThe walls are lined with frescoes by _Pomerancio_ and _Tempesta_. They\r\nbegin with the Crucifixion, but as the Holy Innocents really suffered\r\nbefore our Saviour, one of them is represented lying on each side of the\r\ncross. Next comes the stoning of St. Stephen, and the frescoes continue\r\nto pourtray every phase of human agony in the most revolting detail, but\r\nare interesting as showing a historical series of what the Roman\r\nCatholic Church considers as the best authenticated martyrdoms, viz.:\r\n\r\n                       {St. Peter, crucified.\r\n                       {St. Paul, beheaded.\r\n                       {St. Vitale, buried alive.\r\n                       {St. Thecla, tossed by a bull.\r\n  Under Nero           {St. Gervase, beaten to death.\r\n                       {SS.

Stefano Rotondo exhibits, in a series of pictures all round the\r\n     church, the martyrdoms of the Christians in the so-called\r\n     persecutions, with a general picture of the most eminent martyrs\r\n     since the triumph of Christianity. No doubt many of the particular\r\n     stories thus painted will bear no critical examination; it is\r\n     likely enough, too, that Gibbon has truly accused the general\r\n     statements of exaggeration. But this is a thankless labour, such as\r\n     Lingard and others have undertaken with regard to the St.\r\n     Bartholomew massacre, and the Irish massacre of 1642. Divide the\r\n     sum total of reported martyrs by twenty,--by fifty, if you\r\n     will,--but after all you have a number of persons of all ages and\r\n     sexes suffering cruel torments and death for conscience' sake and\r\n     for Christ's, and by their sufferings manifestly, with God's\r\n     blessing, ensuring the triumph of Christ's gospel. Neither do I\r\n     think that we consider the excellence of this martyr-spirit half\r\n     enough. I do not think pleasure is a sin: the stoics of old, and\r\n     the ascetic Christians since, who have said so (see the answers of\r\n     that excellent man, Pope Gregory the Great, to Augustine's\r\n     questions, as given at length by Bede), have, in saying so,\r\n     outstepped the simplicity and wisdom of Christian truth. But,\r\n     though pleasure is not a sin, yet surely the contemplation of\r\n     suffering for Christ's sake is a thing most needful to us in our\r\n     days, from whom, in our daily life, suffering seems so far removed.\r\n     And, as God's grace enabled rich and delicate persons, women, and\r\n     even children, to endure all extremities of pain and reproach in\r\n     times past, so there is the same grace no less mighty now, and if\r\n     we do not close ourselves against it, it might in us be no less\r\n     glorified in a time of trial. And that such times of trial will\r\n     come, my children, in your times, if not in mine, I do believe\r\n     fully, both from the teaching of man's wisdom and of God's. And\r\n     therefore pictures of martyrdom are, I think, very wholesome--not\r\n     to be sneered at, nor yet to be looked on as a mere\r\n     excitement,--but as a sober reminder to us of what Satan can do to\r\n     hurt, and what God's grace can enable the weakest of His people to\r\n     bear. Neither should we forget those who, by their sufferings, were\r\n     more than conquerors, not for themselves only, but for us, in\r\n     securing to us the safe and triumphant existence of Christ's\r\n     blessed faith--in securing to us the possibility, nay, the actual\r\n     enjoyment, had it not been for the Antichrist of the priesthood--of\r\n     Christ's holy and glorious ἑκκλησια, the\r\n     congregation and commonwealth of Christ's people.\"--_Arnold's\r\n     Letters._\r\n\r\n     \"On croit que l'église de Saint-Etienne-le-Rond est bâtie sur\r\n     l'emplacement du _Macellum Augusti_.

Il se retira alors dans une chaumière perdue au milieu\r\n     des vignes du Mont Cœlius, et là, seul, inconnu au monde, il se\r\n     livra, durant de longs jours, à cette extase de la pensée qui\r\n     agrandit, au-delà de toute mesure, la puissance créatrice de\r\n     l'homme. Le désir des Pères du concile lui ayant été manifesté, il\r\n     prit aussitôt une plume, écrivit en tête de son cahier, 'Mon Dieu,\r\n     éclairez-moi,' et se mit à l'œuvre avec un saint enthousiasme.\r\n     Ses premiers efforts ne répondirent pas à l'idéal que son génie\r\n     s'était formé; mais peu à peu ses pensées s'éclaircirent, et les\r\n     flots de poésie qui inondaient son âme, se répandirent en mélodies\r\n     touchantes. Chaque parole du texte retentissait clairement, allait\r\n     chercher toutes les consciences, et les exaltait dans une émotion\r\n     commune.

Stefano Rotondo--skirted by broken fragments of\r\nNero's aqueduct--almost to its debouchment near St. J. Lateran, and then\r\nturning to the left, we reach the quaint fortress like church and\r\nconvent of the _Santi Quattro Incoronati_ crowned by a stumpy campanile\r\nof 1112. The full title of this church is \"I Santi quattro Pittori\r\nIncoronati e i cinque Scultori Martiri,\" the names which the Church\r\nattributes to the painters being Severus, Severianus, Carpoforus, and\r\nVittorinus; and those of the sculptors Claudius, Nicostratus,\r\nSinforianus, Castorius, and Simplicius,--who all suffered for refusing\r\nto carve and paint idols for Diocletian. Their festa is kept on Nov. 8.\r\n\r\nThis church was founded on the site of a temple of Diana by Honorius I.,\r\nA.D. 622; rebuilt by Leo IV. A.D. 850; and again rebuilt in its present\r\nform by Paschal II., who consecrated it afresh in A.D. 1111. It is\r\napproached through a double court, in which are many ancient\r\ncolumns,--perhaps remains of the temple. Some antiquaries suppose that\r\nthe church itself was once of larger size, and that the pillars which\r\nnow form its atrium were once included in the nave. The interior is\r\narranged on the English plan with a triforium and a clerestory, the\r\ntriforium being occupied by the nuns of the adjoining convent. The\r\naisles are groined, but the nave has a wooden ceiling. Behind the\r\ntribune is a vaulted passage, partly subterranean. The tribune contains\r\na marble throne, and is adorned with frescoes by _Giovanni di San\r\nGiovanni_.[168] In the right aisle are preserved some of the verses of\r\nPope Damasus. Another inscription tells of the restoration of the church\r\nin the fifteenth century, and describes the state of desolation into\r\nwhich it had fallen.\r\n\r\n    \"Hæc quæcumque vides veteri prostrata ruina\r\n    Obruta verberis, ederis, dumisque jacebant.\"\r\n\r\nOpening out of the court in front of the church is the little _Chapel of\r\nS. Sylvestro_, built by Innocent II. in 1140. It contains a series of\r\nvery curious frescoes.\r\n\r\n     \"Showing the influence of Byzantine upon Roman art is the little\r\n     chapel of S. Silvestro, detailing the history of the conversion of\r\n     Constantine with a naïveté which, with the exception of a certain\r\n     dignity in some of the figures, constitutes their sole attraction.\r\n     They are indeed little better than Chinese paintings; the last of\r\n     the series, representing Constantine leading Pope Sylvester's horse\r\n     by the bridle, walking beside him in his long flowing robe, with a\r\n     chattah held over his head by an attendant, has quite an Asiatic\r\n     character.\"--_Lord Lindsay's Christian Art._\r\n\r\n     \"Here, as in so many instances, legend is the genuine reflex, not\r\n     of the external, but the moral part of history. In this series of\r\n     curious wall-paintings, we see Constantine dismissing, consoled and\r\n     laden with gifts, the mothers whose children were to be slaughtered\r\n     to provide a bath of blood, the remedy prescribed--but which he\r\n     humanely rejected--for his leprosy, his punishment for persecuting\r\n     the Church while he yet lingered in the darkness of paganism; we\r\n     see the vision of St. Peter and St. Paul, who appear to him in his\r\n     dreams, and prescribe the infallible cure for both physical and\r\n     moral disease through the waters of baptism; we see the mounted\r\n     emissaries, sent by the emperor to seek St. Sylvester, finding that\r\n     pontiff concealed in a cavern on Mount Soracte; we see that saint\r\n     before the emperor, exhibiting to him the authentic portraits of\r\n     the two apostles (said to be still preserved at St. Peter's),\r\n     pictures in which Constantine at once recognises the forms seen in\r\n     his vision, assuming them to be gods entitled to his worship; we\r\n     see the imperial baptism, with a background of fantastic\r\n     architecture, the rite administered both by immersion (the neophyte\r\n     standing in an ample font) and affusion; we see the pope on a\r\n     throne, before which the emperor is kneeling, to offer him a\r\n     tiara--no doubt the artist intended thus to imply the immediate\r\n     bestowal of temporal sovereignty (very generally believed the act\r\n     of Constantine in the first flush of his gratitude and neophyte\r\n     zeal) upon the papacy; lastly, we see the pontiff riding into Rome\r\n     in triumph, Constantine himself leading his horse, and other mitred\r\n     bishops following on horseback. Another picture--evidently by the\r\n     same hand--quaintly represents the finding of the true cross by St.\r\n     Helena, and the miracle by which it was distinguished from the\r\n     crosses of the two thieves,--a subject here introduced because a\r\n     portion of that revered relic was among treasures deposited in this\r\n     chapel, as an old inscription, on one side, records. The largest\r\n     composition on these walls, which completes the series, represents\r\n     the Saviour enthroned amidst angels and apostles. This chapel is\r\n     now only used for the devotions of a guild of marble-cutters, and\r\n     open for mass on but one Sunday--the last--in every\r\n     month.\"--_Hemans Mediæval Christian Art._\r\n\r\nIn the fresco of the Crucifixion in this chapel an angel is represented\r\ntaking off the crown of thorns and putting on a real crown, an incident\r\nnowhere else introduced in art.\r\n\r\nThe castellated Convent of the Santi Quattro was built by Paschal II. at\r\nthe same time as the church, and was used as a papal palace while the\r\nLateran was in ruins, hence its defensive aspect, suited to the\r\ntroublous times of the anti-popes. It is now inhabited by Augustinian\r\nNuns.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Cœlian beneath the Incoronati, and in the street\r\nleading from the Coliseum to the Lateran, is the _Church of S.\r\nClemente_, to which recent discoveries, have given an extraordinary\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe upper church, in spite of modernizations under Clement XI. in the\r\nlast century, retains more of the details belonging to primitive\r\necclesiastical architecture than any other building in Rome. It was\r\nconsecrated in memory of Clement, the fellow-labourer of St Paul, and\r\nthe third bishop of Rome, upon the site of his family house. It was\r\nalready important in the time of Gregory the Great, who here read his\r\nthirty-third and thirty-eighth homilies. It was altered by Adrian I. in\r\nA.D. 772, and by John VIII. in A.D. 800, and again restored in A.D. 1099\r\nby Paschal II., who had been cardinal of the church, and who was elected\r\nto the papacy within its walls. The greater part of the existing\r\nbuilding is thus either of the ninth or the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nAt the west end a porch supported by two columns, and attributed to the\r\neighth century, leads into the _quadriporticus_, from which is the\r\nentrance to the nave, separated from its aisles by sixteen columns\r\nevidently plundered from pagan buildings. Raised above the nave and\r\nprotected by a low marble wall is the _cancellum_, preserving its\r\nancient pavement, ambones, altar, and episcopal throne.\r\n\r\n     \"In S. Clemente, built on the site of his paternal mansion, and\r\n     restored at the beginning of the twelfth century, an example is\r\n     still to be seen, in perfect preservation, of the primitive church;\r\n     everything remains in statu quo--the court, the portico, the\r\n     cancellum, the ambones, paschal candlestick, crypt, and\r\n     ciborium--virgin and intact; the wooden roof has unfortunately\r\n     disappeared, and a small chapel, dedicated to St. Catherine, has\r\n     been added, yet even this is atoned for by the lovely frescoes of\r\n     Masaccio. I most especially recommend this relic of early\r\n     Christianity to your affectionate and tender admiration. Yet the\r\n     beauty of S. Clemente is internal only, outwardly it is little more\r\n     than a barn.\"--_Lord Lindsay._\r\n\r\nOn the left of the side entrance is the Chapel of the Passion, clothed\r\nwith frescoes of _Masaccio_, which, though restored, are very\r\nbeautiful--over the altar is the Crucifixion, on the side walls the\r\nstories of St. Clement and St Catherine.\r\n\r\n     \"The celebrated series relating to St. Catherine is still most\r\n     striking in the grace and refinement of its principal figures:\r\n\r\n     \"1. St. Catherine (cousin of the Emperor Constantine) refuses to\r\n     worship idols.\r\n\r\n     \"2. She converts the empress of Maximin.

The empress is beheaded, and her soul is carried to heaven by\r\n     an angel.\r\n\r\n     \"4. Catherine disputes with the pagan philosophers. She is standing\r\n     in the midst of a hall, the forefinger of one hand laid on the\r\n     other, as in the act of demonstrating. She is represented fair and\r\n     girlish, dressed with great simplicity in a tunic and girdle,--no\r\n     crown, nor any other attribute. The sages are ranged on each side,\r\n     some lost in thought, others in astonishment, the tyrant (Maximin)\r\n     is seen behind, as if watching the conference, while through an\r\n     open window we behold the fire kindled for the converted\r\n     philosophers, and the scene of their execution.\r\n\r\n     \"5.

It was during\r\n     this journey, which, in fact, added much to his renown, that he\r\n     painted, in the Church of San Clemente--the chapel which now so\r\n     usually disappoints the expectations of the traveller, on account\r\n     of the successive restorations by which his work has been\r\n     disfigured.... The heavy brush which has passed over each\r\n     compartment has spared neither the delicacy of the outline, the\r\n     roundness of the forms, nor the play of light and shade: in a word,\r\n     nothing which constitutes the peculiar merit of Masaccio.\"--_Rio,\r\n     Poetry of Christian Art._\r\n\r\nAt the end of the right aisle is the beautiful tomb of Cardinal\r\nRovarella, ob. 1476.

The figure of St. Dominic is a modern addition. It seems\r\n     evident, from characteristics of style, that the other mosaics\r\n     here, above the apsidal arch, and at the spandrils, are more\r\n     ancient, perhaps by about a century; these latter representing the\r\n     Saviour in benediction, the four Evangelic emblems, St. Peter and\r\n     St. Clement, St. Paul and St. Laurence seated; the two apostles\r\n     designated by their names, with the Greek 'hagios' in Latin\r\n     letters. The later art-work was ordered (see the Latin inscription\r\n     below) in 1299, by a cardinal titular of S.

Here, there are\r\nseveral pillars of the rarest marbles in perfect preservation, and a\r\nvery curious series of frescoes of the eighth and ninth centuries, parts\r\nof which are still clear and almost uninjured. These include--the\r\nCrucifixion, with the Virgin and St. John standing by the cross,--the\r\nearliest example in Rome of this well-known subject; the Ascension,\r\nsometimes called by Romanists (in preparation for their dogma of 1870),\r\n\"the Assumption of the Virgin,\" because the figure of the Virgin is\r\nelevated above the other apostles, though she is evidently intent on\r\nwatching the retreating figure of her divine Son--in this fresco the\r\nfigure of a pope is introduced (with the square nimbus, showing that it\r\nwas painted in his lifetime), and the inscription \"Sanctissimus dominus,\r\nLeo Papa Romanus,\" probably Leo III. or Leo IV.; the Maries at the\r\nsepulchre; the descent into Hades; the Marriage of Cana; the Funeral of\r\nSt. Cyril with Pope Nicholas I. (858--67) walking in the procession;\r\nand, the most interesting of all--probably of somewhat later date, the\r\nstory of S. Clemente, and that of S. Alexis, whose adventures are\r\ndescribed in the account of his church on the Aventine. An altar of\r\nMithras was discovered during the excavations here. Beneath this crypt\r\nis still a third structure, discovered 1867,--probably the very house of\r\nSt. Clement,--(decorated with rich stucco ornament)--sometimes supposed\r\nto be the 'cavern near S. Clemente' to which the Emperor Otho III., who\r\ndied at the age of twenty-two, retired in A.D. 999 with his confessor,\r\nand where he spent fourteen days in penitential retirement.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Acts of the Martyrs, the Prefect Mamertinus ordered the\r\narrest of Pope Clement, and intended to put him to death, but was\r\ndeterred by a tumult of the people, who cried with one voice, \"What evil\r\nhas he done, or rather what good has he not done?\" Clement was then\r\ncondemned to exile in the Chersonese, and Mamertinus, touched by his\r\nsubmission and courage, dismissed him with the words--\"May the God you\r\nworship bring you relief in the place of your banishment.\"\r\n\r\nIn his exile Clement received into the Church more than two hundred\r\nChristians who had been waiting for baptism, and miraculously discovered\r\nwater for their support in a barren rock, to which he was directed by a\r\nLamb, in whose form he recognised the guidance of the Son of God. The\r\nenthusiasm which these marvels excited led Trajan to send executioners,\r\nby whom he was tied to an anchor and thrown into the sea. But his\r\ndisciples, kneeling on the shore, prayed that his relics might be given\r\nup to them, when the waves retired, and disclosed a marble chapel, built\r\nby unearthly hands--over the tomb of the saint. From the Chersonese the\r\nremains of St. Clement were brought back to Rome by St. Cyril, the\r\nApostle of the Slavonians, who, dying here himself, was buried by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE AVENTINE.\r\n\r\n     Jewish Burial-ground--Sta.

Sabina, S. Alessio, and the Priorato,\r\nwhich together form \"the Capitol of the Aventine;\" the other, known as\r\nthe Pseudo-Aventine, is marked by the churches of S. Sabba and Sta.\r\nBalbina.\r\n\r\nVirgil and Ovid allude repeatedly to the thick woods which once clothed\r\nthe Aventine.[169] Dionysius speaks of the laurels or bays, an\r\nindigenous tree of ancient Rome, which grew there in abundance. Only one\r\nside of the hill, that towards the Tiber, now shows any of the natural\r\ncliff, but it was once remarkable for its rocks, and the Pseudo-Aventine\r\nobtained the name of Saxum from a huge solitary mass of stone which\r\nsurmounted it.\r\n\r\n    \"Est moles nativa; loco res nomina fecit\r\n    Appellant Saxum: pars bona mentis ea est.\"[170]\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the hill is of volcanic formation, and it is\r\nsupposed that the legend of Cacus vomiting forth flames from his cave on\r\nthe side of the Aventine had its origin in noxious sulphuric vapours\r\nemitted by the soil, as is still the case at the Solfatara on the way to\r\nTivoli. The demi-god Faunus, who had an oracle at the Solfatara, had\r\nalso an oracle on this hill.[171]\r\n\r\nSome derive the name of Aventine from Aventinus-Silvius, king of Alba,\r\nwho was buried here;[172] others from Avens, a Sabine river; while\r\nothers say that the name simply means \"the hill of birds,\" and connect\r\nit with the story of the foundation of the city. For when it became\r\nnecessary to decide whether Romulus or Remus was to rule over the\r\nnewly-built Rome, Romulus seated himself upon the Palatine to watch the\r\nauspices, but Remus upon the rock of the Pseudo-Aventine. Here Remus saw\r\nonly six vultures, while Romulus saw twelve, but each interpreted the\r\naugury in his own favour, and Remus leapt across the boundary of the\r\nPalatine, whether in derision or war, and was slain by his brother, or\r\nby Celer, one of his followers. He was brought back and buried upon the\r\nAventine, and the stone whence he had watched the vultures was\r\nthenceforth called the Sacred Rock. Ancient tradition places the tomb of\r\nRemus on the Pseudo-Aventine, but in the middle ages the tomb of Caius\r\nCestus was believed--even by Petrarch--to be the monument of Remus.\r\n\r\nSome authorities consider that when Remus was watching the vultures on\r\nthe Pseudo-Aventine, that part of the hill was already occupied by a\r\nPelasgic fortress called Romoria, but at this time and for long\r\nafterwards, the higher part of the Aventine was held by the Sabines.\r\nHere the Sabine king Numa dedicated an altar to Jupiter Elicius,[173]\r\nand the Sabine god Consus had also an altar here. Hither Numa came to\r\nvisit the forest-gods Faunus and Picus at their sacred fountain:\r\n\r\n    Lucus Aventino suberat niger ilicis umbra,\r\n      Quo posses viso dicere, numen inest.\r\n    In medio gramen, muscoque adoperta virenti\r\n      Manabat saxo vena perennis aquæ.\r\n    Inde fere soli Faunus Picusque bibebant.[174]\r\n\r\nBy mingling wine and honey with the waters of their spring, Numa snared\r\nthe gods, and compelled them to tell him how he might learn from Jupiter\r\nthe knowledge of his will, and to reveal to him a charm against thunder\r\nand lightning.[175]\r\n\r\nThe Sabine king Tatius, the rival of Romulus, was buried on the Aventine\r\n\"in a great grove of laurels,\" and, at his tomb, then called\r\nArmilustrum, it was the custom, every year, in the month of October, to\r\nhold a feast for the purification of arms, accompanied by martial\r\ndances. A horse was at the same time sacrificed to Janus, the Sabine\r\nwar-god.[176]\r\n\r\nAncus Martius surrounded the Aventine by a wall,[177] and settled there\r\nmany thousands of the inhabitants of Latin towns which he had subdued.\r\nThis was the origin of the plebs, who were soon to become such\r\nformidable opponents of the first colonists of the Palatine, who took\r\nrank as patricians, and who at first found in them an important\r\ncounterpoise to the power of the original Sabine inhabitants, against\r\nwhom the little Latin colony of Romulus had hitherto been standing\r\nalone. The Aventine continued always to be the especial property and\r\nsanctuary of the plebs, the patricians avoiding it--in the first\r\ninstance, it is supposed, from an impression that the hill was of evil\r\nomen, owing to the story of Remus. In B.C. 416, the tribune Icilius\r\nproposed and carried a law by which all the public lands of the Aventine\r\nwere officially conferred upon the plebs, who forthwith began to cover\r\nits heights with houses, in which each family of the people had a right\r\nin one floor,--a custom which still prevails at Rome. At this time,\r\nalso, the Aventine was included for the first time within the\r\npomœrium or religious boundary of the city. Owing to its being the\r\n\"hill of the people,\" the commons henceforth held their comitia and\r\nelected their tribunes here; and here, after the murder of Virginia, to\r\nwhom the tribune Icilius had been betrothed, the army assembled against\r\nAppius Claudius.\r\n\r\nVery little remains of the numerous temples which once adorned the hill,\r\nbut their sites are tolerably well ascertained. We still ascend the\r\nAventine by the ancient Clivus Publicius, originally paved by two\r\nbrothers Publicii, who were ædiles at the same time, and had embezzled a\r\npublic sum of money, which they were compelled to expend thus--\r\n\r\n    Parte locant clivum, qui tune erat ardua rupes:\r\n    Utile nunc iter est, Publiciumque vocant.[178]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of this road was the temple of Luna, or Jana, in which\r\nTatius had also erected an altar to Janus or the Sun.\r\n\r\n    Luna regit menses; hujus quoque tempora mensis\r\n    Finit Aventino Luna colenda jugo.[179]\r\n\r\nIt was up this road that Caius Gracchus, a few hours before his death,\r\nfled to take refuge in a small Temple of Diana, which stood somewhere\r\nnear the present site of S. Alessio, where, kneeling before the statue\r\nof the goddess, he implored that the people who had betrayed him might\r\nnever be free. Close by, singularly enough, rose the Temple of Liberty,\r\nwhich his grandfather Sempronius Gracchus had built. Adjoining this\r\ntemple was a hall where the archives of the censors were kept, and where\r\nthey transacted business; this was rebuilt by Asinius Pollio, who added\r\nto it the first public library established in Rome.\r\n\r\n    Nec me, quæ doctis patuerunt prima libellis\r\n    Atria, Libertas tangere passa sua est.[180]\r\n\r\nIn the same group stood the famous sanctuary of Juno Regina, vowed by\r\nCamillus during the siege of Veii, and to which the Juno of the captured\r\ncity was removed after she had given a verbal consent when asked whether\r\nshe wished to go to Rome and inhabit a new temple, much as the modern\r\nqueen of heaven is apt to do in modern times at Rome.[181] The Temples\r\nof Liberty and Juno were both rebuilt under Augustus; some imagine that\r\nthey were under a common roof. If they were distinct buildings, nothing\r\nof the former remains; some beautiful columns built into the church of\r\nSta. Sabina are all that remain of the temple of Juno, though Livy\r\nthought that her reign here would be eternal--\r\n\r\n    ... in Aventinum, æternam sedem suam.[182]\r\n\r\nAlso belonging to this group was a Temple of Minerva.\r\n\r\n    Sol abit a Geminis, et Cancri signa rubescunt:\r\n    Cœpit Aventina Pallas in arce coli.[183]\r\n\r\nHere the dramatist Livius Andronicus, who lived upon the Aventine, was\r\nhonoured after his death by a company of scribes and actors. Another\r\npoet who lived upon the Aventine was Ennius, who is described as\r\ninhabiting a humble dwelling, and being attended by a single female\r\nslave. The poet Gallus also lived here.\r\n\r\n    Totis, Galle, jubes tibi me servire diebus,\r\n    Et per Aventinum ter quater ire tuum![184]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Aventine (above the Circus Maximus), which was\r\noriginally covered with myrtle--a shrub now almost extinct at Rome--on\r\nthe site now occupied by Sta. Prisca, was a more important Temple of\r\nDiana, sometimes called by the Sabine name of Murcia,--built in\r\nimitation of the temple of Diana at Ephesus. Propertius writes--\r\n\r\n    Phyllis Aventinæ quædam est vicina Dianæ;[185]\r\n\r\nand Martial--\r\n\r\n    Quique videt propius magna certamina Circi\r\n    Laudat Aventinæ vicinus Sura Dianæ.[186]\r\n\r\nHere till the time of Dionysius was preserved the pillar of brass on\r\nwhich was engraved the law of Icilius.\r\n\r\nNear this were the groves of Simila, the retreat of the infamous\r\nassociation discovered and terribly punished at the time of the Greek\r\nwars; and--in the time of the empire--the gardens of Servilia, where she\r\nreceived the devotion of Julius Cæsar, and in which her son Brutus is\r\nsaid to have conspired his murder, and to have been interrogated by his\r\nwife Portia as to the mystery, which he refused to reveal to her,\r\nfearing her weakness under torture, until, by the concealment of a\r\nterrible wound which she had given to herself, she had proved to him\r\nthat the daughter of Cato could suffer and be silent.\r\n\r\nThe Aventine continued to be inhabited, and even populous, until the\r\nsixth century, from which period its prosperity began to decline. In the\r\neleventh century it was occupied by the camp of Henry IV. of Germany,\r\nwhen he came in war against Gregory VII. In the thirteenth century\r\nHonorius III. made a final effort to re-establish its popularity; but\r\nwith each succeeding generation it has become--partly owing to the\r\nravages of malaria--more and more deserted, till now its sole\r\ninhabitants are monks, and the few ague-stricken contadini who look\r\nafter the monastic vineyards. In wandering along its desolate lanes,\r\nhemmed in by hedges of elder, or by walls covered with parasitical\r\nplants, it is difficult to realize the time when it was so thickly\r\npopulated; and except in the quantities of coloured marbles with which\r\nits fields and vineyards are strewn, there is nothing to remind one of\r\nthe 16 ædiculæ, 64 baths, 25 granaries, 88 fountains, 130 of the larger\r\nhouses called _domus_, and 2487 of the poorer houses called _insulæ_,\r\nwhich occupied this site.\r\n\r\nThe present interest of the hill is almost wholly ecclesiastical, and\r\ncentres around the story of St. Dominic, and the legends of the saints\r\nand martyrs connected with its different churches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe best approach to the Aventine is behind the Church of Sta. Maria in\r\nCosmedin, where the _Via Sta. Sabina_, once the Clivus Publicius\r\n(available for carriages), turns up the hill.\r\n\r\nA lane on the left leads to the Jewish burial-ground, used as a place of\r\nsepulture for the Ghetto for many centuries. A curious instance of the\r\ncupidity attributed to the Jewish race may be seen in the fact, that\r\nthey have, for a remuneration of four baiocchi, habitually given leave\r\nto their neighbours to discharge the contents of a rubbish cart into\r\ntheir cemetery, a permission of which the Romans have so abundantly\r\navailed themselves, that the level of the soil has been raised by many\r\nyards, and whole sets of older monuments have been completely swallowed\r\nup, and new ones erected over their heads.\r\n\r\nAfter we turn the corner at the hill top, with its fine view over the\r\nPalatine, and cross the trench of fortification formed during the fear\r\nof a Garibaldian invasion in 1867, we skirt what appears to be part of a\r\ncity wall. This is in fact the wall of the Honorian city, built by Pope\r\nHonorius III., of the great family of Savelli, whose idea was to render\r\nthe Aventine once more the populous and favourite portion of the city,\r\nand who began great works for this purpose. Before his arrangements were\r\ncompleted St. Dominic arrived in Rome, and was appointed master of the\r\npapal household, and abbot of the convent of Sta. Sabina, where his\r\nministrations and popularity soon formed such an attraction, that the\r\npope wisely abandoned his design of founding a new city which should\r\ncommemorate himself, and left the field to St. Dominic,--to whom he made\r\nover the land on this side of the hill. Henceforward the convent of\r\nSta. Sabina and its surroundings have become, more than any other spot,\r\nconnected with the history of the Dominican Order,--there, all the great\r\nsaints of the Order have received their first inspiration,--have\r\nresided,--or are buried; there St. Dominic himself received in a\r\nbeatific vision the institution of the rosary; there he was ordered to\r\nplant the famous orange-tree, which, being then unknown in Rome, he\r\nbrought from his native Spain as the only present which it was suitable\r\nfor the gratitude of a poor monk to offer to his patron Honorius, who\r\nwas himself one of the great botanists of his time,--an orange-tree\r\nwhich still lives, and which is firmly believed by the monks to flourish\r\nor fail with the fortunes of the Order, so that it has lately been\r\ngreatly the worse for the suppression of the convents in Northern Italy,\r\nthough the residence of Père Lacordaire within the convent proved\r\nexceedingly beneficial to it, and his visit even caused a new sucker to\r\nsprout.\r\n\r\nThe _Church of Sta. Sabina_ was built on the site of the house of the\r\nsaint--in which she suffered martyrdom under the Emperor Hadrian,[187]\r\nin A.D. 423--by Peter, a priest of Illyria, \"rich for the poor, and poor\r\nfor himself\" _(pauperibus locuples, sibi pauper)_, as we read by the\r\nmosaic inscription inside the principal entrance. St. Gregory the Great\r\nread two of his homilies here. The church was rebuilt in 824, and\r\nrestored and reconsecrated by Gregory IX. in 1238. Much of its\r\ninterest,--ancient pavements, mosaics, &c.,--was destroyed in 1587 by\r\nSixtus V., who took the credit of discovering the relics of the martyrs\r\nwho are buried beneath the altar.\r\n\r\nOn the west is a covered corridor containing several ancient\r\ninscriptions. It is supported on one side by ancient spiral columns of\r\npavonazzetto, on the other these have been plundered and replaced by\r\ngranite. Hence, through a window, ladies are allowed to gaze upon the\r\ncelebrated orange-tree, 665 years old, which they cannot approach; a\r\nrude figure of St. Dominic is sculptured upon the low wall which\r\nsurrounds it. The west door, of the twelfth century, in a richly\r\nsculptured frame, is cited by Kugler as an instance of the extinction of\r\nthe Byzantine influence upon art. Its panels are covered with carvings\r\nfrom the Old and New Testament, referred by Mamachi to the seventh, by\r\nAgincourt to the thirteenth century. Some of the subjects have been\r\ndestroyed; among those which remain are the Annunciation, the Angels\r\nappearing to the Shepherds, the Angel and Zachariah in the Temple, the\r\nMagi, Moses turning the rods into serpents, the ascent of Elijah, Christ\r\nbefore Pilate, the denial of Peter, and the Ascension. Within the\r\nentrance are the only remains of the magnificent mosaic, erected in 431,\r\nunder Celestine I., which entirely covered the west wall till the time\r\nof Sixtus V., consisting of an inscription in large letters, with a\r\nfemale figure on either side, that on the left bearing the name\r\n\"Ecclesia cum circumcisione,\" that on the right, \"Ecclesia ex gentibus.\"\r\nAmong the parts destroyed were the four beasts typical of the\r\nEvangelists, and St. Peter and St. Paul. The church was thus gorgeously\r\ndecorated, because in the time of the Savelli popes, it was what the\r\nSistine is now, the Chiesa Apostolica.\r\n\r\nThe nave is lined by twenty-four Corinthian columns of white marble,\r\nrelics of the temple of Juno Regina, which once stood here. Above, is\r\nan inlaid frieze of pietradura, of A.D. 431, which once extended up to\r\nthe windows, but was destroyed by Sixtus V., who at the same time built\r\nup the windows which till then existed over each pier. In the middle of\r\nthe pavement near the altar, is a very curious mosaic figure over the\r\ngrave of Munoz de Zamora, a General of the Dominican Order, who died in\r\n1300. Nearer the west door are interesting incised slabs representing a\r\nGerman bishop and a lady, benefactors of this church, and (on the left)\r\na slab with arms in mosaic, to a lady of the Savelli family. In the left\r\naisle is another monument of 1312, commemorating a warrior of the\r\nimperial house of Germany. The high altar covers the remains of Sabina\r\nand Seraphia, Alexander the Pope, Eventius and Theodulus, all martyrs.\r\nIn the chapel beneath St. Dominic is said to have flagellated himself\r\nthree times nightly, \"perché uno colpo solo non abbastava per\r\nmortificare la carne.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the right aisle is the Chapel of the Rosary, where a\r\nbeautiful picture of Sassoferrato, called \"La Madonna del Rosario,\"\r\ncommemorates the vision of St. Dominic on that spot, in which he\r\nreceived the rosary from the hands of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Catherine of Siena kneels with St. Dominic before the throne\r\n     of the Madonna; the lily at her feet. The Infant Saviour is turned\r\n     towards her, and with one hand he crowns her with thorns, with the\r\n     other he presents the rosary. This is the master-piece of the\r\n     painter, with all his usual elegance, without his usual\r\n     insipidity.\"--_Jameson's Monastic Orders._\r\n\r\nFew Roman Catholic practices have excited more animadversion than the\r\n\"vain repetition\" of the worship of the Rosary. The Père Lacordaire (a\r\nDominican) defended it, saying--\r\n\r\n     \"Le rationaliste sourit en voyant passer de longues files de gens\r\n     qui redisent une même parole. Celui qui est éclairé d'une meilleure\r\n     lumière comprend que l'amour n'a qu'un mot, et qu'en le disant\r\n     toujours, il ne le répète jamais.\"\r\n\r\nGrouped around this chapel are three beautiful tombs,--a cardinal, a\r\nbishop, and a priest of the end of the fifteenth century. That of the\r\ncardinal (which is of the well-known Roman type of the time), is\r\ninscribed \"Ut moriens viveret, vixit est moriturus;\" the others are\r\nincised slabs. At the other end of this aisle is a marble slab, on which\r\nSt. Dominic is said to have been wont to lie prostrate in prayer. One\r\nday while he was lying thus, the Devil in his rage is said to have\r\nhurled a huge stone (a round black marble, _pietra di paragone_,) at\r\nhim, which missed the saint, who left the attack entirely unnoticed. The\r\ndevil was frantic with disappointment, and the stone, remaining as a\r\nrelic, is preserved on a low pillar in the nave. A small gothic\r\nciborium, richly inlaid with mosaic, remains on the left of the tribune.\r\n\r\nOpening from the left aisle is a chapel built by Elic of Tuscany--very\r\nrich in precious marbles. The frame of the panel on the left is said to\r\nbe unique.\r\n\r\nIt was in this church, in 1218, that St. Hyacinth, struck by the\r\npreaching of St. Dominic, and by the recollection of the barbarism,\r\nheathenism, and ignorance which prevailed in many parts of his native\r\nland of Silesia, offered himself as its missionary, and took the vows of\r\nthe Dominican Order, together with his cousin St. Ceslas. Hither fled to\r\nthe monastic life St. Thomas Aquinas, pursued to the very door of the\r\nconvent by the tears and outcries of his mother, who vainly implored him\r\nto return to her. One evening, a pilgrim, worn out with travel and\r\nfatigue, arrived at the door of this convent mounted upon a wretched\r\nmule, and implored admittance. The prior in mockery asked, \"What are you\r\ncome for, my father? are you come to see if the college of cardinals is\r\ndisposed to elect you as pope?\" \"I come to Rome,\" replied the pilgrim\r\nMichele Ghislieri, \"because the interests of the Church require it, and\r\nI shall leave as soon as my task is accomplished; meanwhile I implore\r\nyou to give me a brief hospitality and a little hay for my mule.\"\r\nSixteen years afterwards Ghislieri mounted the papal throne as Pius V.,\r\nand proved, during a troubled reign, the most rigid follower and eager\r\ndefender of the institutions of St. Dominic. One day as Ghislieri was\r\nabout to kiss his crucifix in the eagerness of prayer, \"the image of\r\nChrist,\" says the legend, retired of its own accord from his touch, for\r\nit had been poisoned by an enemy, and a kiss would have been death. This\r\ncrucifix is now preserved as a precious relic in the convent, where the\r\ncells both of St. Dominic and of St. Pius V. are preserved, though, like\r\nmost historical chambers of Roman saints, their interest is lessened by\r\ntheir having been beautified and changed into chapels. In the cell of\r\nSt. Dominic is a portrait by _Bazzani_, founded on the records of his\r\npersonal appearance; the lily lies by his side,--the glory hovers over\r\nhis head,--he is, as the chronicler describes him, \"of amazing beauty.\"\r\nIn this cell he is said frequently to have passed the night in prayer\r\nwith his rival St. Francis of Assisi. The refectory is connected with\r\nanother story of St. Dominic:--\r\n\r\n     \"It happened that when he was residing with forty of his friars in\r\n     the convent of Sta. Sabina at Rome, the brothers who had been sent\r\n     to beg for provisions had returned with a very small quantity of\r\n     bread, and they knew not what they should do, for night was at\r\n     hand, and they had not eaten all day. Then St. Dominic ordered that\r\n     they should seat themselves in the refectory, and, taking his place\r\n     at the head of the table, he pronounced the usual blessing: and\r\n     behold! two beautiful youths clad in white and shining garments\r\n     appeared amongst them; one carried a basket of bread, and the other\r\n     a pitcher of wine, which they distributed to the brethren: then\r\n     they disappeared, and no one knew how they had come in, nor how\r\n     they had gone out. And the brethren sat in amazement; but St.\r\n     Dominic stretched forth his hand, and said calmly, 'My children,\r\n     eat what God hath sent you:' and it was truly celestial food, such\r\n     as they had never tasted before nor since.\"--_Jameson's Monastic\r\n     Orders_, p. 369.\r\n\r\nOther saints who sojourned for a time in this convent were St. Norbert,\r\nfounder of the Premonstratensians (ob. 1134), and St. Raymond de\r\nPenaforte (ob. 1275), who left his labours in Barcelona for a time in\r\n1230 to act as chaplain to Gregory IX.\r\n\r\nIn 1287 a conclave was held at Sta. Sabina for the election of a\r\nsuccessor to Pope Martin IV., but was broken up by the malaria, six\r\ncardinals dying at once within the convent, and all the rest taking\r\nflight except Cardinal Savelli, who would not desert his paternal home,\r\nand survived by keeping large fires constantly burning in his chamber.\r\nTen months afterwards his perseverance was rewarded by his own election\r\nto the throne as Honorius IV.\r\n\r\nIn the garden of the convent are some small remains of the palace of the\r\nSavelli pope, Honorius III. Here, on the declivity of the Aventine, many\r\nimportant excavations were made in 1856--57, by the French Prior Besson,\r\na person of great intelligence, and he was rewarded by the discovery of\r\nan ancient Roman house--its chambers paved with black and white mosaic,\r\nand some fine fragments of the wall of Servius Tullius, formed of\r\ngigantic blocks of peperino. In the chambers which were found decorated\r\nin stucco with remnants of painting in figures and arabesque ornaments,\r\n\"one little group represented a sacrifice before the statue of a god, in\r\nan ædicula. Some rudely scratched Latin lines on this surface led to the\r\ninference that this chamber, after becoming subterranean and otherwise\r\nuninhabitable, had served for a prison; one unfortunate inmate having\r\ninscribed curses against those who caused his loss of liberty; and\r\nanother, more devout, left record of his vows to sacrifice to Bacchus in\r\ncase of recovering that blessing.\"[188]\r\n\r\nSince the death of Prior Besson[189] the works have been abandoned, and\r\nthe remains already discovered have been for the most part earthed up\r\nagain. A nympheum, a well, and several subterranean passages, are still\r\nvisible on the hillside.\r\n\r\nJust beyond Sta. Sabina is the Hieronymite _Church and Convent of S.\r\nAlessio_, the only monastery of Hieronymites in Italy where meat was\r\nallowed to be eaten,--in consideration of the malaria. The first church\r\nerected here was built in A.D. 305 in honour of St. Boniface, martyr, by\r\nAglae, a noble Roman lady, whose servant (and lover) he had been. It was\r\nreconsecrated in A.D. 401 by Innocent I., in honour of St. Alexis, whose\r\npaternal mansion was on this site. This saint, young and beautiful, took\r\na vow of virginity, and being forced by his parents into marriage, fled\r\non the same evening from his home, and was given up as lost. Worn out\r\nand utterly changed he returned many years afterwards to be near those\r\nwho were dear to him, and remained, unrecognised, as a poor beggar,\r\nunder the stairs which led to his father's house. Seventeen years\r\npassed away, when a mysterious voice suddenly echoed through the Roman\r\nchurches, crying, \"Seek ye out the man of God, that he may pray for\r\nRome.\" The crowd was stricken with amazement,--when the same voice\r\ncontinued, \"Seek in the house of Euphemian.\" Then, pope, emperor, and\r\nsenators rushed together to the Aventine, where they found the despised\r\nbeggar dying beneath the doorstep, with his countenance beaming with\r\ncelestial light, a crucifix in one hand, and a sealed paper in the\r\nother. Vainly the people strove to draw the paper from the fingers which\r\nwere closing in the gripe of death, but when Innocent I. bade the dying\r\nman in God's name to give it up, they opened, and the pope read aloud to\r\nthe astonished multitude the secret of Alexis; and his father Euphemian\r\nand his widowed bride, regained in death the son and the husband they\r\nhad lost.\r\n\r\nS. Alessio is entered through a courtyard.\r\n\r\n     \"The courtyards in front of S. Alessio, Sta. Cecilia, S. Gregorio,\r\n     and other churches, are like the vestibula of the ancient Roman\r\n     houses, on the site of which they were probably built. This style\r\n     of building, says Tacitus, was generally introduced by Nero. Beyond\r\n     opened the _prothyra_, or inner entrance, with the _cellæ_ for the\r\n     porter and dog, _both_ chained, on either side.\"\r\n\r\nIn the portico of the church is a statue of Benedict XIII. (Pietro\r\nOrsini, 1724). The west door has a rich border of mosaic. The church has\r\nbeen so much modernised as to retain no appearance of antiquity. The\r\nfine Opus-Alexandrinum pavement is preserved. In the floor is the\r\nincised gothic monument of Lupi di Olmeto, General of the Hieronymites\r\n(ob. 1433). Left of the entrance is a shrine of S. Alessio, with his\r\nfigure sleeping under the staircase--part of the actual wooden stairs\r\nbeing enclosed in a glass case over his head. Not far from this is the\r\nancient well of his father's house. In a chapel which opens out of a\r\npassage leading to the sacristy is the fine tomb of Cardinal Guido di\r\nBalneo, of the time of Leo X. He is represented sitting, with one hand\r\nresting on the ground--the delicate execution of his lace in marble is\r\nmuch admired. The mosaic roof of this chapel was burst open by a\r\ncannon-ball during the French bombardment of 1849, but the figure was\r\nuninjured. The baldacchino (well known from Macpherson's photographs) is\r\nremarkable for its perfect proportions. Behind, in the tribune, are the\r\ninlaid mosaic pillars of a gothic tabernacle. No one should omit to\r\ndescend into the _Crypt of S. Alessio_, which is an early church,\r\nsupported on stunted pillars, and containing a marble episcopal chair,\r\ngreen with age. Here the pope used to meet the early conclaves of the\r\nChurch in times of persecution. The pillar under the altar is shown as\r\nthat to which St. Sebastian was bound when he was shot with the arrows.\r\n\r\nThe cloister of the convent, from which ladies are excluded, blooms with\r\norange and lemon trees. There are only six Hieronymite brethren here\r\nnow. The convent was at one time purchased by the ex-king Ferdinand of\r\nSpain, who intended turning it into a villa for himself.\r\n\r\nA short distance beyond S. Alessio is a sort of little square, adorned\r\nwith trophied memorials of the knights of Malta, and occupying the site\r\nof the laurel grove (Armilustrum) which contained the tomb of Tatius.\r\nHere is the entrance of the Priorato garden, where is the famous _View\r\nof St. Peter's through the Keyhole_, admired by crowds of people on\r\nAsh-Wednesday, when the \"stazione\" is held at the neighbouring churches.\r\nEntering the garden (which can always be visited) we find ourselves in a\r\nbeautiful avenue of old bay-trees framing the distant St. Peter's. A\r\nterrace overhanging the Tiber has an enchanting view over the river and\r\ntown. In the garden is an old pepper-tree, and in a little court a\r\npicturesque palm-tree and well. From hence we can enter the church,\r\nsometimes called _S. Basilio_, sometimes _Sta. Maria Aventina_, an\r\nancient building modernized by Cardinal Rezzonico in 1765, from the very\r\nindifferent designs of Piranesi. It contains an interesting collection\r\nof tombs, most of them belonging to the Knights of Malta; that of Bishop\r\nSpinelli is an ancient marble sarcophagus, with a relief of Minerva and\r\nthe Muses. A richly sculptured ancient altar contains relics of saints\r\nfound beneath the pavement of the church.\r\n\r\nThe Priorato garden, so beautiful and attractive in itself, has an\r\nadditional interest as that in which the famous Hildebrand (Gregory\r\nVII., 1073--80) was brought up as a boy, under the care of his uncle,\r\nwho was abbot of the adjoining monastery. A massive cornice in these\r\ngrounds is one of the few architectural fragments of ancient Rome\r\nexisting on the Aventine. It may perhaps have belonged to the smaller\r\ntemple of Diana in which Caius Gracchus took refuge, and in escaping\r\nfrom which, down the steep hillside, he sprained his ankle, and so was\r\ntaken by his pursuers. Some buried houses were discovered and some\r\nprecious vases brought to light, when Urban VIII. built the stately\r\nbuttress walls which now support the hillside beyond the Priorato.\r\n\r\nThe cliff below these convents is the supposed site of the cave of the\r\ngiant Cacus, described by Virgil.\r\n\r\n    \"At specus et Caci detecta apparuit ingens\r\n    Regia, et umbrosæ penitus patuere cavernæ;\r\n    Non secus, ac si quâ penitus vi terra dehiscens\r\n    Infernas reseret sedes, et regna recludat\r\n    Pallida, dîs invisa; superque immane barathrum\r\n    Cernatur, trepidentque immisso lumine manes.\"\r\n\r\n    _Æneid_, lib. viii.\r\n\r\nHercules brought the oxen of Geryon to pasture in the valley between the\r\nAventine and Palatine. Cacus issuing from his cave while their owner was\r\nasleep, carried off four of the bulls, dragging them up the steep side\r\nof the hill by their tails, that Hercules might be deceived by their\r\nfoot-prints being reversed. Then he concealed them in his cavern, and\r\nbarred the entrance with a rock. Hercules sought the stolen oxen\r\neverywhere, and when he could not find them, he was going away with the\r\nremainder. But as he drove them along the valley near the Tiber one of\r\nhis oxen lowed, and when the stolen oxen in the cave heard that, they\r\nanswered; and Hercules, after rushing three times round the Aventine\r\nboiling with fury, shattered the stone which guarded the entrance of the\r\ncave with a mass of rock, and, though the giant vomited forth smoke and\r\nflames against him, he strangled him in his arms. Thus runs the legend,\r\nwhich is explained by Ampère.\r\n\r\n     \"Cacus habite une caverne de l'Aventin, montagne en tout temps mal\r\n     famée, montagne anciennement hérissée de rochers et couverte de\r\n     forêts, dont la forêt Nœvia, longtemps elle-même un repaire de\r\n     bandits, était une dépendance et fut un reste qui subsista dans\r\n     les temps historiques. Ce Cacus était sans doute un brigand\r\n     célèbre, dangereux pour les pâtres du voisinage dont il volait les\r\n     troupeaux quand ils allaient paître dans les prés situés au bord du\r\n     Tibre et boire l'eau du fleuve. Les hauts faits de Cacus lui\r\n     avaient donné cette célébrité qui, parmi les paysans romains,\r\n     s'attache encore à ses pareils, et surtout le stratagème employé\r\n     par lui probablement plus d'une fois pour dérouter les bouviers des\r\n     environs, en emmenant les animaux qu'il dérobait, à manière de\r\n     cacher la direction de leurs pas. La caverne du bandit avait été\r\n     découverte et forcée par quelque pâtre courageux, qui y avait\r\n     pénétré vaillamment, malgré la terreur que ce lieu souterrain et\r\n     formidable inspirait, y avait surpris le voleur et l'avait\r\n     étranglé.\r\n\r\n     \"Tel était, je crois, le récit primitif où il n'était pas plus\r\n     question d'Hercule que de Vulcain, et dans lequel Cacus n'était pas\r\n     mis à mort par un demi-dieu, mais par un certain Recaranus, pâtre\r\n     vigoureux et de grande taille. A ces récits de bergers, qui\r\n     allaient toujours exagérant les horreurs de l'antre de Cacus et la\r\n     résistance désespérée de celui-ci, vinrent se mêler peu à peu des\r\n     circonstances merveilleuses.\"--_Hist. Rom._ i. 170.\r\n\r\nWe must retrace our steps, as far as the summit of the hill towards the\r\nPalatine, and then turn to the right in order to reach the ugly\r\nobscure-looking _Church of Sta. Prisca_, founded by Pope Eutychianus in\r\nA.D. 280, but entirely modernised by Cardinal Giustiniani from designs\r\nof Carlo Lombardi, who encased its fine granite columns in miserable\r\nstucco pilasters. Over the high altar is a picture by _Passignano_ of\r\nthe baptism of the saint, which is said to have taken place in the\r\nancient crypt beneath the church, where an inverted Corinthian\r\ncapital,--a relic of the temple of Diana which once occupied this\r\nsite,--is shown as the font in which Sta. Prisca was baptized by St.\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\nOpening from the right aisle is a kind of terraced loggia with a\r\npeculiar and beautiful view. In the adjoining vineyard are three arches\r\nof an aqueduct.\r\n\r\n     \"According to the old tradition, this church stands on the site of\r\n     the house of Aquila and Priscilla, where St. Peter lodged when at\r\n     Rome, and who are the same mentioned by St. Paul as tent-makers;\r\n     and here is shown the font, from which, according to the same\r\n     tradition, St. Peter baptized the first Roman converts to\r\n     Christianity. The altar-piece represents the baptism of Sta.\r\n     Prisca, whose remains being afterwards placed in the church, it has\r\n     since borne her name. According to the legend, she was a Roman\r\n     virgin of illustrious birth, who, at the age of thirteen, was\r\n     exposed in the amphitheatre. A fierce lion was let loose upon her,\r\n     but her youth and innocence disarmed the fury of the savage beast,\r\n     which, instead of tearing her to pieces, humbly licked her\r\n     feet;--to the great consolation of Christians, and the confusion of\r\n     idolaters. Being led back to prison, she was there beheaded.\r\n     Sometimes she is represented with a lion, sometimes with an eagle,\r\n     because it is related that an eagle watched by her body till it was\r\n     laid in the grave; for thus, says the story, was virgin innocence\r\n     honoured by kingly bird as well as by kingly beast.\"--_Mrs.\r\n     Jameson._\r\n\r\nOpposite the door of this church is the entrance of the _Vigna dei\r\nGesuiti_, a wild and beautiful vineyard occupying the greater part of\r\nthis deserted hill, and extending as far as the Porta S. Paolo and the\r\npyramid of Caius Cestius. Several farm-houses are scattered amongst the\r\nvines and fruit trees. There are beautiful views towards the Alban\r\nmountains, and to the Pseudo-Aventine with its fortress-like convents.\r\nThe ground is littered with fragments of marbles and alabaster, which\r\nlie unheeded among the vegetables, relics of unknown edifices which once\r\nexisted here. Just where the path in the vineyard descends a slight\r\ndeclivity towards S. Paolo, are the finest existing remains of the\r\n_Walls of Servius Tullius_,[190] formed of large quadrilateral blocks of\r\ntufa, laid alternately long and cross-ways, as in the Etruscan\r\nbuildings. The spot is beautiful, and overgrown by a luxuriance of wild\r\nmignonette and other flowers in the late spring.\r\n\r\nDescending to the valley beneath Sta. Prisca, and crossing the lane\r\nwhich leads from the Via Appia to the Porta S. Paolo, we reach, on the\r\nside of the Pseudo-Aventine, the _Church of S. Sabba_, which is supposed\r\nto mark the site of the Porta Randusculana of the walls of Servius\r\nTullius. Its position is very striking, and its portico, built in A.D.\r\n1200, is picturesque and curious.\r\n\r\nThis church is of unknown origin, but is known to have existed in the\r\ntime of St. Gregory the Great, and to have been one of the fourteen\r\nprivileged abbacies of Rome. Its patron saint was St. Sabbas, an abbot\r\nof Cappadocia, who died at Jerusalem in A.D. 532.\r\n\r\n     \"The record of the artist Jacobus dei Cosmati, dated the third year\r\n     of Innocent III. (1205), on the lintel of the mosaic-inlaid\r\n     doorway, justifies us in classing this church among monuments of\r\n     the thirteenth century. From its origin a Greek monastery, it was\r\n     assigned by Lucius II., in 1141, to the Benedictines of the Cluny\r\n     rule. An epigraph near the sacristy mentions a rebuilding either of\r\n     the cloisters or church, in 1325, by an abbot Joannes; and in 1465\r\n     the roof was renewed in woodwork by a cardinal, the nephew of Pius\r\n     II.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1512 the Cistercians of Clairvaux were located here by Julius\r\n     II.; and some years later these buildings were given to the\r\n     Germanic-Hungarian College. Amidst gardens and vineyards,\r\n     approached by a solitary lane between hedgerows, this now deserted\r\n     sanctuary has a certain affecting character in its forlornness.\r\n     Save on Thursdays, when the German students are brought hither by\r\n     their Jesuit professors to enliven the solitude by their sports and\r\n     converse, we might never succeed in finding entrance to this quiet\r\n     retreat of the monks of old.\r\n\r\n     \"Within the arched porch, through which we pass into an outer\r\n     court, we read an inscription telling that here stood the house and\r\n     oratory (called _cella nova_) of Sta. Sylvia, mother of St. Gregory\r\n     the Great, whence the pious matron used daily to send a porridge of\r\n     legumes to her son, while he inhabited his monastery on the Clivus\r\n     Scauri, or northern ascent of the Cœlian. Within that court\r\n     formerly stood the cloistral buildings, of which little now\r\n     remains. The façade is remarkable for its atrium in two stories:\r\n     the upper with a pillared arcade, probably of the fifteenth\r\n     century; the lower formerly supported by six porphyry columns,\r\n     removed by Pius VI. to adorn the Vatican library, where they still\r\n     stand. The porphyry statuettes of two emperors embracing, supposed\r\n     either an emblem of the concord between the East and West, or the\r\n     intended portraits of the co-reigning Constantine II. and\r\n     Constans--a curious example of sculpture in its deep decline, and\r\n     probably imported by Greek monks from Constantinople--project from\r\n     two of those ancient columns.\"--_Hemans' Mediæval Art._\r\n\r\nThe interior of St. Sabba is in the basilica form. It retains some\r\nfragments of inlaid pavements, some handsome inlaid marble panels on\r\neither side of the high altar, and an ancient sarcophagus. The tribune\r\nhas rude paintings of the fourteenth century--the Saviour between St.\r\nAndrew and St. Sabbas the Abbot; and below the Crucifixion, the Madonna\r\nand the twelve Apostles. Beneath the tribune is a crypt,--and over its\r\naltar a beautifully ornamented disk with a Greek cross in the centre.\r\n\r\nBehind St. Sabbas is another delightful vineyard, but it is difficult to\r\ngain admittance. Here Flaminius Vacca describes the discovery of a\r\nmysterious chamber without door or window, whose pavement was of agate\r\nand cornelian, and whose walls were plated with gilt copper; but of this\r\nnothing remains.[191]\r\n\r\nTo reach the remaining church of the Aventine, we have to turn to the\r\nVia Appia, and then follow the lane which leads up the hillside from the\r\nBaths of Caracalla to the _Church of Sta. Balbina_, whose picturesque\r\nred brick tower forms so conspicuous a feature, as seen against the long\r\nsoft lines of the flat Campagna, in so many Roman views. It was erected\r\nin memory of Sta. Balbina, a virgin martyr (buried in Sta. Maria in\r\nDomenica), who suffered under Hadrian, A.D. 132. It contains the remains\r\nof an altar erected by Cardinal Barbo, in the old basilica of St.\r\nPeter's, a splendid ancient throne of marble inlaid with mosaics, and a\r\nfine tomb of Stefano Sordi, supporting a recumbent figure, and adorned\r\nwith mosaics by one of the Cosmati.\r\n\r\nAdjoining this church Monsignor de Mérode established a house of\r\ncorrection for youthful offenders, to avert the moral result of exposing\r\nthem to communication with other prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE VIA APPIA.\r\n\r\n     The Porta Capena--Baths of Caracalla--Vigna Guidi--SS.

Maria\r\n     Nuova--Roma Vecchia--Casale Rotondo--Tor di Selce, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Via Appia_, called Regina Viarum by Statius, was begun B.C. 312, by\r\nthe Censor Appius Claudius the Blind, \"the most illustrious of the great\r\nSabine and Patrician race, of whom he was the most remarkable\r\nrepresentative.\" It was paved throughout, and during the first part of\r\nits course served as a kind of patrician cemetery, being bordered by a\r\nmagnificent avenue of family tombs. It began at the Porta Capena, itself\r\ncrossed by the Claudian aqueduct, which was due to the same great\r\nbenefactor,--\r\n\r\n    \"Substitit ad veteres arcus madidamque Capenam,\"\r\n\r\nand was carried by Claudius across the Pontine Marshes as far as Capua,\r\nbut afterwards extended to Brundusium.\r\n\r\nThe site of the Porta Capena, so important as marking the commencement\r\nof the Appian Way, was long a disputed subject. The Roman antiquaries\r\nmaintained that it was outside the present Walls, basing their opinion\r\non the statement of St. Gregory, that the river Almo was in that Regio,\r\nand considering the Almo identical with a small stream which is crossed\r\nin the hollow about half a mile beyond the Porta S. Sebastiano, and\r\nwhich passes through the Valle Caffarelle, and falls into the Tiber near\r\nS. Paolo. This stream, however, which rises at the foot of the Alban\r\nHills below the lake, divides into two parts about six miles from Rome,\r\nand its smaller division, after flowing close to the Porta San Giovanni,\r\nrecedes again into the country, enters Rome near the Porta Metronia, a\r\nlittle behind the Church of S. Sisto, and passing through the Circus\r\nMaximus, falls into the Tiber at the Pulchrum Littus, below the temple\r\nof Vesta. Close to the point where this, the smaller branch of the Almo,\r\ncrosses the Via San Sebastiano, Mr. J. H. Parker, in 1868--69,\r\ndiscovered some remains, on the original line of walls, which he has\r\nidentified, beyond doubt, as those of the _Porta Capena_, whose position\r\nhad been already proved by Ampère and other authorities.\r\n\r\nClose to the Porta Capena stood a large group of historical buildings,\r\nof which no trace remains. On the right of the gate was the temple of\r\nMars:\r\n\r\n    \"Lux eadem Marti festa est; quem prospicit extra\r\n    Appositum Tectæ Porta Capena viæ.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ vi. 191.\r\n\r\nIt is probably in allusion to this temple that Propertius says:\r\n\r\n    \"Armaque quum tulero portæ votiva Capenæ,\r\n    Subscribam, salvo grata puella viro.\"\r\n\r\n    _Prop._ iv. _Eleg._ 3.\r\n\r\nMartial alludes to a little temple of Hercules near this:\r\n\r\n    \"Capena grandi porta qua pluit gutta,\r\n    Phrygiæque Matris Almo qua lavat ferrum,\r\n    Horatiorum qua viret sacer campus,\r\n    Et qua pusilli fervet Herculis fanum.\"\r\n\r\n    _Mart._ iii. _Ep._ 47.\r\n\r\nNear the gate also stood the tomb of the murdered sister of the\r\nHoratii,[192] with the temples of Honour and Virtue, vowed by Marcellus\r\nand dedicated by his son,[193] and a fountain, dedicated to Mercury:\r\n\r\n    \"Est aqua Mercurii portæ vicina Capenæ;\r\n      Si juvat expertis credere, numen habet.\r\n    Huc venit incinctus tunicas mercator, et urna\r\n      Purus suffita, quam ferat, haurit aquam.\r\n    Uda fit hinc laurus: lauro sparguntur ab uda\r\n      Omnia, quæ dominos sunt habitura novos.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ v. 673.\r\n\r\nIt was at the Porta Capena that the survivor of the Horatii met his\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n     \"Horatius went home at the head of the army, bearing his triple\r\n     spoils. But as they were drawing near to the Capenian gate, his\r\n     sister came out to meet him. Now she had been betrothed in marriage\r\n     to one of the Curiatii, and his cloak, which she had wrought with\r\n     her own hands, was borne on the shoulders of her brother; and she\r\n     knew it, and cried aloud, and wept for him she had loved. At the\r\n     sight of her tears Horatius was so wrath that he drew his sword,\r\n     and stabbed his sister to the heart; and he said, 'So perish the\r\n     Roman maiden who shall weep for her country's enemy!'\"--_Arnold's\r\n     Hist. of Rome_, i. 16.\r\n\r\nAmong the many other historical scenes with which the Porta Capena is\r\nconnected, we may remember that it was here that Cicero was received in\r\ntriumph by the senate and people of Rome, upon his return from\r\nbanishment B.C. 57.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo roads lead to the Via S. Sebastiano, one the Via S. Gregorio, which\r\ncomes from the Coliseum beneath the arch of Constantine; the other, the\r\nstreet which comes from the Ghetto, through the Circus Maximus, between\r\nthe Palatine and Aventine.\r\n\r\nThe first gate on the left, after the junction of these roads, is that\r\nof the vineyard of the monks of S. Gregorio, in which the site of the\r\nPorta Capena was found. The remains discovered have been reburied, owing\r\nto the indifference or jealousy of the government; but the vineyard is\r\nworth entering on account of the picturesque view it possesses of the\r\nPalace of the Cæsars.\r\n\r\nOn the right, a lane leads up the Pseudo-Aventine to the Church of Sta.\r\nBalbina, described Chap. VIII.\r\n\r\nOn the left, where the Via Appia crosses the brook of the Almo, now\r\ncalled Maranna, the Via di San Sisto Vecchio leads to the back of the\r\nCœlian behind S. Stefano Rotondo. Here, in the hollow, in the grounds\r\nof the Villa Mattei, under some picturesque farm-buildings, is a spring\r\nwhich modern archæology has determined to be the true _Fountain of\r\nEgeria_, where Numa Pompilius is described as having his mysterious\r\nmeetings with the nymph Egeria. The locality of this fountain was\r\nverified when that of the Porta Capena was ascertained, as it was\r\ncertain that it was in the immediate neighbourhood of that gate, from a\r\npassage in the 3d Satire of Juvenal, which describes, that when he was\r\nwaiting at the Porta Capena with Umbritius while the waggon was loading\r\nfor his departure to Cumæ, they rambled into the valley of Egeria, and\r\nUmbritius said, after speaking of his motives for leaving Rome, \"I could\r\nadd other reasons to these, but my beasts summon me to move on, and the\r\nsun is setting. I must be going, for the muleteer has long been\r\nsummoning me by the cracking of his whip.\"\r\n\r\nTo this valley the oppressed race of the Jews was confined by Domitian,\r\ntheir furniture consisting of a basket and a wisp of hay:\r\n\r\n    \"Nunc sacri fontis nemus et delubra locantur\r\n    Judæis, quorum cophinus fœnumque supellex.\"\r\n\r\n    _Juvenal, Sat._ iii. 13.\r\n\r\nOn the right, are the _Baths of Caracalla_, the largest mass of ruins in\r\nRome, except the Coliseum; consisting for the most part of huge\r\nshapeless walls of red and orange-coloured brickwork, framing vast\r\nstrips of blue sky, and tufted with shrubs and flowers. These baths,\r\nwhich could accommodate 1600 bathers at once, were begun in A.D. 212, by\r\nCaracalla, continued by Heliogabalus, and finished under Alexander\r\nSeverus. They covered a space of 2,625,000 square yards--a size which\r\nmade Ammianus Marcellinus say that the Roman baths were like\r\nprovinces--and they were supplied with water by the Antonine Aqueduct,\r\nwhich was brought hither for that especial purpose from the Claudian,\r\nover the Arch of Drusus.\r\n\r\nAntiquaries have amused themselves by identifying different chambers, to\r\nwhich, with considerable uncertainty, the names of Calidarium,\r\nLaconicum, Tepidarium, Frigidarium, &c., have been affixed.\r\n\r\nThe habits of luxury and inertion which were introduced with the\r\nmagnificent baths of the emperors were among the principal causes of the\r\ndecline and fall of Rome. Thousands of the Roman youth frittered away\r\ntheir hours in these magnificent halls, which were provided with\r\neverything which could gratify the senses. Poets were wont to recite\r\ntheir verses to those who were reclining in the baths.\r\n\r\n                         ----\"In medio qui\r\n    Scripta foro recitent, sunt multi,--quique lavantes:\r\n    Suave locus voci resonat conclusus.\"\r\n\r\n    _Horace, Sat._ i. 4.\r\n\r\n     \"These _Thermæ_ of Caracalla, which were one mile in circumference,\r\n     and open at stated hours for the indiscriminate service of the\r\n     senators and the people, contained above sixteen hundred seats of\r\n     marble. The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious\r\n     mosaics that imitated the art of the pencil in elegance of design\r\n     and in the variety of their colours. The Egyptian granite was\r\n     beautifully encrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia.\r\n     The perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious\r\n     basons through so many wide mouths of bright and massy silver; and\r\n     the meanest Roman could purchase, with a small copper coin, the\r\n     daily enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite\r\n     the envy of the kings of Asia. From these stately palaces issued\r\n     forth a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians, without shoes and\r\n     without mantle; who loitered away whole days in the street or\r\n     Forum, to hear news and to hold disputes; who dissipated, in\r\n     extravagant gaming, the miserable pittance of their wives and\r\n     children; and spent the hours of the night in the indulgence of\r\n     gross and vulgar sensuality.\"--_Gibbon._\r\n\r\nIn the first great hall was found, in 1824, the immense mosaic pavement\r\nof the pugilists, now in the Lateran museum. Endless works of art have\r\nbeen discovered here from time to time, among them the best of the\r\nFarnese collection of statues,--the Bull, the Hercules, and the\r\nFlora,--which were dug up in 1534, when Paul III. carried off all the\r\nstill remaining marble decorations of the baths to use for the Farnese\r\nPalace. The last of the pillars to be removed from hence is that which\r\nsupports the statue of Justice in the Piazza Sta. Trinità at Florence.\r\n\r\nA winding stair leads to the top of the walls, which are worth\r\nascending, as well for the idea which you there receive of the vast size\r\nof the ruins, as for the lovely views of the Campagna, which are\r\nobtained between the bushes of lentiscus and phillyrea with which they\r\nare fringed. It was seated on these walls that Shelley wrote his\r\n\"Prometheus Unbound.\"\r\n\r\n     \"This poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the\r\n     baths of Caracalla, among the flowery glades and thickets of\r\n     odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever-winding\r\n     labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in\r\n     the air. The bright blue sky of Rome, and the effect of the\r\n     vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate, and the new\r\n     life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication, were\r\n     the inspiration of the drama.\"--_Preface to the Prometheus._\r\n\r\n     \"Maintenant les murailles sont nues, sauf quelques fragments de\r\n     chapiteaux oubliés par la destruction; mais elles conservent ce que\r\n     seules des mains de géant pourraient leur ôter, leur masse\r\n     écrasante, la grandeur de leurs aspects, la sublimité de leurs\r\n     ruines. On ne regrette rien quand on contemple ces énormes et\r\n     pittoresque débris, baignés à midi par une ardente lumière ou se\r\n     remplissant d'ombres à la tombée de la nuit, s'élançant, à une\r\n     immense hauteur vers un ciel éblouissant, ou se dressant, mornes et\r\n     mélancoliques, sous un ciel grisâtre,--ou bien, lorsque, montant\r\n     sur la plate-forme inégale, crevassée, couverte d'arbustes et\r\n     tapissée de gazon, on voit, comme du haut d'une colline, d'un côté\r\n     se dérouler la campagne romaine et le merveilleux horizon de\r\n     montagnes qui la termine, de l'autre apparaître, ainsi qu'une\r\n     montagne de plus, le dôme de Saint-Pierre, la seule des œuvres\r\n     d'homme qui ait quelque chose de la grandeur des œuvres de\r\n     Dieu.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 286.\r\n\r\nThe name of the lane which leads to the baths (_Via all' Antoniana_)\r\nrecalls the fact that, \"with a vanity which seems like mockery,\r\nCaracalla dared to bear the name of Antoninus,\" which was always dear\r\nto the Roman people.\r\n\r\nPassing under the wall of the government-garden for raising shrubs for\r\nthe public walks, a door on the left of the Via Appia, with a sculptured\r\nmarble frieze above it, is that of Guidi, the antiquity vendor, who has\r\na small museum here of splendid fragments of marble and alabaster for\r\nsale. Opposite is the Vigna of Signor Guidi, who has unearthed a\r\nsplendid mosaic pavement of Tritons riding on dolphins, and who has here\r\nalso a collection of antique fragments to be disposed of.\r\n\r\nOn the right, is _SS. Nereo ed Achilleo_, a most interesting little\r\nchurch. The tradition runs that St. Peter, going to execution, let drop\r\nhere one of the bandages of his wounds, and that the spot was marked by\r\nthe early Christians with an oratory, which bore the name of Fasciola.\r\nNereus and Achilles, eunuchs in the service of Clemens Flavius and\r\nFlavia Domitilla (members of the imperial family exiled to Pontia under\r\nDiocletian), having suffered martyrdom at Terracina, their bodies were\r\ntransported here in 524 by John I., when the oratory was enlarged into a\r\nchurch, which was restored under Leo III., in 795. The church was\r\nrebuilt in the sixteenth century, by Cardinal Baronius, who took his\r\ntitle from hence. In his work he desired that the ancient basilica\r\ncharacter should be carefully carried out, and all the ancient ornaments\r\nof the church were preserved and re-erected. His anxiety that his\r\nsuccessors should not meddle with or injure these objects of antiquity\r\nis shown by, the inscription on a marble slab in the tribune:\r\n\r\n     \"Presbyter, Card. Successor quisquis fueris, rogo te, per gloriam\r\n     Dei, et per merita horum martyrum, nihil demito, nihil minuito, nec\r\n     mutato; restitutam antiquitatem pie servato; sic Deus martyrum\r\n     suorum precibus semper adjuvet!\"\r\n\r\nThe chancel is raised and surrounded by an inlaid marble screen. Instead\r\nof ambones there are two plain marble reading-desks for the epistle and\r\ngospel. The altar is inlaid, and has \"transennæ,\" or a marble grating,\r\nthrough which the tomb of the saints Nereus and Achilles may be seen,\r\nand through which the faithful might pass their handkerchiefs to touch\r\nit. Behind, in the semicircular choir, is an ancient episcopal throne,\r\nsupported by lions, and ending in a gothic gable. Upon it part of the\r\ntwenty-eighth homily of St. Gregory was engraved by Baronius, under the\r\nimpression that it was delivered thence,--though it was really first\r\nread in the catacomb, whence the bodies of the saints were not yet\r\nremoved. All these decorations are of the restoration under Leo III., in\r\nthe eighth century. Of the same period are the mosaics on the arch of\r\nthe tribune (partly painted over in later times), representing, in the\r\ncentre, the Transfiguration (the earliest instance of the subject being\r\ntreated in art), with the Annunciation on one side, and the Madonna and\r\nChild attended by angels on the other.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while remarking that when the relics of Flavia Domitilla\r\n(who was niece of Vespasian) and of Nereus and Achilles were brought\r\nhither from the catacomb on the Via Ardeatina, which bears the name of\r\nthe latter, they were first escorted in triumph to the Capitol, and made\r\nto pass under the imperial arches which bore as inscriptions: \"The\r\nsenate and the Roman people to Sta. Flavia Domitilla, for having brought\r\nmore honour to Rome by her death than her illustrious relations by\r\ntheir works.\" ... \"To Sta. Flavia Domitilla, and to the Saints Nereus\r\nand Achilles, the excellent citizens who gained peace for the Christian\r\nrepublic at the price of their blood.\"\r\n\r\nOpposite, on the left, is a courtyard leading to the _Church of S.\r\nSisto_, with its celebrated convent, long deserted on account of\r\nmalaria.\r\n\r\nIt was here that St. Dominic first resided in Rome, and collected one\r\nhundred monks under his rule, before he was removed to Sta. Sabina by\r\nHonorius III. After he went to the Aventine, it was decided to utilize\r\nthis convent by collecting here the various Dominican nuns, who had been\r\nliving hitherto under very lax discipline, and allowed to leave their\r\nconvents, and reside in their own families. The nuns of Sta. Maria in\r\nTrastevere resisted the order, and only consented to remove on condition\r\nof bringing with them a Madonna picture attributed to St. Luke, hoping\r\nthat the Trasteverini would refuse to part with their most cherished\r\ntreasure. St. Dominic obviated the difficulty by going to fetch the\r\npicture himself at night, attended by two cardinals, and a bare-footed,\r\ntorch-bearing multitude.\r\n\r\n     \"On Ash-Wednesday, 1218, the abbess and some of her nuns went to\r\n     take possession of their new monastery, and being in the\r\n     chapter-house with St. Dominic and Cardinal Stefano di Fossa Nuova,\r\n     suddenly there came in one tearing his hair, and making great\r\n     outcries, for the young Lord Napoleon Orsini, nephew of the\r\n     cardinal, had been thrown from his horse, and killed on the spot.\r\n     The cardinal fell speechless into the arms of Dominic, and the\r\n     women and others who were present were filled with grief and\r\n     horror. They brought the body of the youth into the chapter-house,\r\n     and laid it before the altar; and Dominic, having prayed, turned to\r\n     it, saying, 'O adolescens Napoleo, in nomine Domini nostri Jesu\r\n     Christi tibi dico surge,' and thereupon he arose sound and whole,\r\n     to the unspeakable wonder of all present.\"--_Jameson's Monastic\r\n     Orders._\r\n\r\nAfter being convinced by this miracle of the divine mission of St.\r\nDominic, forty nuns settled at S. Sisto, promising never more to cross\r\nits threshold.[194]\r\n\r\nThere is very little remaining of the ancient S. Sisto, except the\r\ncampanile, which is of 1500. But the vaulted _Chapter-House_, now\r\ndedicated to St. Dominic, is well worth visiting. It has recently been\r\ncovered with frescoes by the Padre Besson,--himself a Dominican\r\nmonk,--who received his commission from Father Mullooly, Prior of S.\r\nClemente, the Irish Dominican convent, to which S. Sisto is now annexed.\r\nThe three principal frescoes represent three miracles of St. Dominic--in\r\neach case of raising from the dead. One represents the resuscitation of\r\na mason of the new monastery, who had fallen from a scaffold; another,\r\nthat of a child in a wild and beautiful Italian landscape; the third,\r\nthe restoration of Napoleone Orsini on this spot,--the mesmeric\r\nupspringing of the lifeless youth being most powerfully represented. The\r\nwhole chapel is highly picturesque, and effective in colour. Of two\r\ninscriptions, one commemorates the raising of Orsini; the other, a\r\nprophecy of St. Dominic, as to the evil end of two monks who deserted\r\ntheir convent.\r\n\r\nJust beyond S. Sisto, where the Via della Ferratella branches off on the\r\nleft to the Lateran, stands a small ædiculum, or _Shrine of the Lares_,\r\nwith brick niches for statues.\r\n\r\nFurther, on the right, standing back from a kind of piazza, adorned with\r\nan ancient granite column, is the _Church of S. Cesareo_, which already\r\nexisted in the time of St. Gregory the Great, but was modernized under\r\nClement VII. (1523--34). Its interior retains many of its ancient\r\nfeatures. The pulpit is one of the most exquisite specimens of church\r\ndecoration in Rome, and is covered with the most delicate sculpture,\r\ninterspersed with mosaic; the emblems of the Evangelists are introduced\r\nin the carving of the panels. The high altar is richly encrusted with\r\nmosaics, probably by the Cosmati family; tiny owls form part of the\r\ndecorations of the capitals of its pillars. Beneath is a \"confession,\"\r\nwhere two angels are drawing curtains over the tomb of the saint. The\r\nchancel has an inlaid marble screen. In the tribune is an ancient\r\nepiscopal throne, once richly ornamented with mosaics.\r\n\r\nIn this church St. Sergius was elected to the papal throne, in 687; and\r\nhere, also, an Abbot of SS. Vincenzo ed Anastasio was elected in 1145,\r\nas Eugenius III., and was immediately afterwards forced by the opposing\r\nsenate to fly to Montecelli, and then to the Abbey of Farfa, where his\r\nconsecration took place.\r\n\r\nPart of the palace of the titular cardinal of S. Cesareo remains in the\r\nadjoining garden, with an interesting loggia of _c._ 1200.\r\n\r\nIn this neighbourhood was the _Piscina Publica_, which gave a name to\r\nthe twelfth Region of the city. It was used for learning to swim, but\r\nall trace of it had disappeared before the time of Festus, whose date is\r\nuncertain, but who lived before the end of the fourth century--\r\n\r\n    \"In thermas fugio: sonas ad aurem,\r\n    Piscinam peto: non licet natare.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, iii. _Ep._ 44.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere a lane turns on the left, towards the ancient _Porta Latina_\r\n(through which the Via Latina led to Capua), now closed.\r\n\r\nIn front of the gate is a little chapel, of the sixteenth century,\r\ncalled _S. Giovanni in Oleo_, decorated with indifferent frescoes, on\r\nthe spot where St. John is said to have been thrown into a cauldron of\r\nboiling oil (under Domitian), from which \"he came forth as from a\r\nrefreshing bath.\" It is the suffering in the burning oil which gave St.\r\nJohn the palm of a martyr, with which he is often represented in art.\r\nThe festival of \"St. John ante Port. Lat.\" (May 6) is preserved in the\r\nEnglish Church Calendar.\r\n\r\nOn the left, is the _Church of S. Giovanni a Porta Latina_, built in\r\n1190 by Celestine III.\r\n\r\nIn spite of many modernizations, the last by Cardinal Rasponi in 1685,\r\nthis building retains externally more of its ancient character than most\r\nRoman churches, in its fine campanile and the old brick walls of the\r\nnave and apse, decorated with terra-cotta friezes. The portico is\r\nentered by a narrow arch resting on two granite columns. The\r\nentrance-door and the altar have the peculiar mosaic ribbon decoration\r\nof the Cosmati, of 1190. The frescoes are all modern; in the tribune,\r\nare the deluge and the baptism of Christ,--the type and antitype. Of the\r\nten columns, eight are simple and of granite, two are fluted and of\r\nporta-santa, showing that they were not made for the church, but removed\r\nfrom some pagan building--probably from the temple of Ceres and\r\nProserpine. Near the entrance is a very picturesque marble _Well_, like\r\nthose so common at Venice and Padua, decorated with an intricate pattern\r\nof rich carving.\r\n\r\nIn the opposite vineyard, behind the chapel of the Oleo, very\r\npicturesquely situated under the Aurelian Wall, is the _Columbarium of\r\nthe Freedmen of Octavia_. A columbarium was a tomb containing a number\r\nof cinerary urns in niches like pigeon-holes, whence the name. Many\r\ncolumbaria were held in common by a great number of persons, and the\r\nniches could be obtained by purchase or inheritance; in other cases, the\r\nheads of the great houses possessed whole columbaria for their families\r\nand their slaves. In the present instance the columbarium is more than\r\nusually decorated, and, though much smaller, it is far more worth seeing\r\nthan the columbaria which it is the custom to visit immediately upon the\r\nAppian Way. One of the cippi, above the staircase, is beautifully\r\ndecorated with shells and mosaic. Below, is a chamber, whose vault is\r\ndelicately painted with vines and little Bacchi gathering in the\r\nvintage. Round the walls are arranged the urns, some of them in the form\r\nof temples, and very beautifully designed, others merely pots sunk into\r\nthe wall, with conical lids, like pipkins let into a kitchen-range. A\r\nbeautiful vase of lapis-lazuli found here has been transferred to the\r\nVatican.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProceeding along the Via Appia, on the left by a tall cypress (No. 13)\r\nis the entrance to _the Tomb of the Scipios_, a small catacomb in the\r\ntufa rock, discovered in 1780, from which the famous sarcophagus of L.\r\nScipio Barbatus, and a bust of the poet Ennius,[195] were removed to the\r\nVatican by Pius VII.\r\n\r\n    \"The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;\r\n    The very sepulchres lie tenantless\r\n    Of their heroic dwellers.\"\r\n\r\n    _Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nThe contadino at the neighbouring farmhouse provides lights, with which\r\none can visit a labyrinth of steep narrow passages, some of which still\r\nretain inscribed sepulchral slabs. Among the Scipios whose tombs have\r\nbeen discovered here were Lucius Scipio Barbatus and his son, the\r\nconqueror of Corsica; Aula Cornelia wife of Cneius Scipio Hispanis; a\r\nson of Scipio Africanus; Lucius Cornelius son of Scipio Asiaticus;\r\nCornelius Scipio Hispanis and his son Lucius Cornelius. At the further\r\nend of these passages, and now, like them, subterranean, may be seen the\r\npediment and arched entrance of the tomb towards the Via Latina. \"It is\r\nuncertain whether Scipio Africanus was buried at Liternum or in the\r\nfamily tomb. In the time of Livy monuments to him were extant in both\r\nplaces.\"[196]\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful view towards Rome from the vineyard above the tomb.\r\n\r\nA little further on, left (No. 14), is the entrance of the _Vigna\r\nCodini_ (a private garden with an extortionate custode), containing\r\nthree interesting _Columbaria_. Two of these are large square vaults,\r\nsupported by a central pillar, which, as well as the walls, is\r\nperforated by niches for urns. The third has three vaulted passages.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the _Arch of Drusus_. On its summit are the remains of the\r\naqueduct by which Caracalla carried water to his baths. The arch once\r\nsupported an equestrian statue of Drusus, two trophies, and a seated\r\nfemale figure representing Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Arch of Drusus was decreed by the senate in honour of the second son\r\nof the empress Livia, by her first husband, Tiberius Nero. He was father\r\nof Germanicus and the emperor Claudius, and brother of Tiberius. He died\r\nduring a campaign on the Rhine, B.C. 9, and was brought back to be\r\nburied by his step-father Augustus in his own mausoleum. His virtues are\r\nattested in a poem ascribed to Pedo Albinovanus.\r\n\r\n     \"This arch, 'Marmoreum arcum cum tropæo Appia Via' (Suet. I), is,\r\n     with the exception of the Pantheon, the most perfect existing\r\n     monument of Augustan architecture. It is heavy, plain, and narrow,\r\n     with all the dignified but stern simplicity which belongs to the\r\n     character of its age.\"--_Merivale._\r\n\r\n     \"It is hard for one who loves the very stones of Rome, to pass over\r\n     all the thoughts which arise in his mind, as he thinks of the great\r\n     Apostle treading the rude and massive pavement of the Appian Way,\r\n     and passing under that Arch of Drusus at the Porta S. Sebastiano,\r\n     toiling up the Capitoline Hill past the Tabularium of the Capitol,\r\n     dwelling in his hired house in the Via Lata or elsewhere,\r\n     imprisoned in those painted caves in the Prætorian Camp, and at\r\n     last pouring out his blood for Christ at the Tre Fontane, on the\r\n     road to Ostia.\"--_Dean Alford's Study of the New Testament_, p.\r\n     335.\r\n\r\n_The Porta San Sebastiano_ has two fine semicircular towers of the\r\nAurelian wall, resting on a basement of marble blocks, probably\r\nplundered from the tombs on the Via Appia. Under the arch is a gothic\r\ninscription relating to the repulse of some unknown invaders.\r\n\r\nIt was here that the senate and people of Rome received in state the\r\nlast triumphant procession which has entered the city by the Via Appia,\r\nthat of Marc-Antonio Colonna, after the victory of Lepanto in 1571. As\r\nin the processions of the old Roman generals, the children of the\r\nconquered prince were forced to adorn the triumph of the victor, who\r\nrode into Rome attended by all the Roman nobles, \"in abito di grande\r\nformalità,\"[197] preceded by the standard of the fleet.\r\n\r\nFrom the gate, the _Clivus Martis_ (crossed by the railway to Civita\r\nVecchia) descends into the valley of the Almo, where antiquaries\r\nformerly placed the Porta Capena. On the hillside stood a Temple of\r\nMars, vowed in the Gallic war, and dedicated by T. Quinctius the\r\n\"duumvir sacris faciundis,\" in B.C. 387. No remains exist of this\r\ntemple. It was \"approached from the Via Capena by a portico, which must\r\nhave rivalled in length the celebrated portico at Bologna extending to\r\nthe church of the Madonna di S. Luca.\"[198] Near this, a temple was\r\nerected to Tempestas in B.C. 260, by L. Cornelius Scipio, to commemorate\r\nthe narrow escape of his fleet from shipwreck off the coast of\r\nSardinia.[199] Near this, also, the poet Terence owned a small estate of\r\ntwenty acres, presented to him by his friend Scipio Emilianus.[200]\r\nAfter crossing the brook, we pass between two conspicuous tombs. That on\r\nthe left is the _Tomb of Geta_, son of Septimius Severus, the murdered\r\nbrother of Caracalla; that on the right is the _Tomb of Priscilla_, wife\r\nof Abascantius, a favourite freedman of Domitian.\r\n\r\n    \"Est locus, ante urbem, qua primum nascitur ingens\r\n    Appia, quaque Italo gemitus Almone Cybele\r\n    Ponit, et Idæos jam non reminiscitur amnes.\r\n    Hic te Sidonio velatam molliter ostro\r\n    Eximius conjux (nec enim fumantia busta\r\n    Clamoremque rogi potuit perferre), beato\r\n    Composuit, Priscilla, toro.\"\r\n\r\n    _Statius_, lib. v. _Sylv._ i. 222.\r\n\r\nJust beyond this, the _Via Ardeatina_ branches off on the right,\r\npassing, after about two miles, the picturesque _Vigna Marancia_, a\r\npleasant spot, with fine old pines and cypresses.\r\n\r\nWhere the roads divide, is the _Church of Domine Quo Vadis_, containing\r\na copy of the celebrated footprint said to have been left here by Our\r\nSaviour: the original being removed to S. Sebastiano.\r\n\r\n     \"After the burning of Rome, Nero threw upon the Christians the\r\n     accusation of having fired the city. This was the origin of the\r\n     first persecution, in which many perished by terrible and hitherto\r\n     unheard-of deaths. The Christian converts besought Peter not to\r\n     expose his life. As he fled along the Appian Way, about two miles\r\n     from the gates, he was met by a vision of our Saviour travelling\r\n     towards the city. Struck with amazement, he exclaimed, 'Lord,\r\n     whither goest thou?' to which the Saviour, looking upon him with a\r\n     mild sadness, replied, 'I go to Rome to be crucified a second\r\n     time,' and vanished. Peter, taking this as a sign that he was to\r\n     submit himself to the sufferings prepared for him, immediately\r\n     turned back to the city.[201] Michael Angelo's famous statue, now\r\n     in the Church of Sta. Maria sopra Minerva, is supposed to represent\r\n     Christ as he appeared to St. Peter on this occasion. A cast or copy\r\n     of it is in the little church of 'Domine, quo vadis?'\r\n\r\n     \"It is surprising that this most beautiful, picturesque, and, to my\r\n     fancy, sublime legend, has been so seldom treated; and never, as it\r\n     seems to me, in a manner worthy of its capabilities and high\r\n     significance. It is seldom that a story can be told by two figures,\r\n     and these two figures placed in such grand and dramatic\r\n     contrast;--Christ in His serene majesty, and radiant with all the\r\n     joy of beatitude, yet with an expression of gentle reproach; the\r\n     Apostle at his feet arrested in his flight, amazed, and yet filled\r\n     with a trembling joy; and for the background the wide Campagna, or\r\n     towering walls of imperial Rome.\"--_Mrs. Jameson._[202]\r\n\r\nBeyond the church is a second \"Bivium,\" or cross-ways, where a lane on\r\nthe left leads up the Valle Caffarelle. Here, feeling an uncertainty\r\n_which_ was the crossing where Our Saviour appeared to St. Peter, the\r\nEnglish Cardinal Pole erected a second tiny chapel of \"Domine Quo\r\nVadis,\" which remains to this day.\r\n\r\nOn the left, is the _Columbarium of the Freedmen of Augustus and Livia_,\r\ndivided into three chambers, but despoiled of its adornments. Other\r\nColumbaria near this are assigned to the Volusii, and the Cæcilii.\r\n\r\nOver the wall on the left of the Via Appia now hangs in profusion the\r\nrare yellow-berried ivy. Many curious plants are to be found on these\r\nold Roman walls. Their commonest parasite, the Pellitory--\"_herba\r\nparietina_,\" calls to mind the nickname given to the Emperor Trajan in\r\nderision of his passion for inscribing his name upon the walls of Roman\r\nbuildings which he had merely restored, as if he were their\r\nfounder;[203] a passion in which the popes have since largely\r\nparticipated.\r\n\r\nWe now reach (on the right) the entrance of the _Catacombs of St.\r\nCalixtus_.\r\n\r\n     (The Catacombs (except those at S. Sebastiano) can only be visited\r\n     in company of a guide. For most of the Catacombs it is necessary to\r\n     obtain a _permesso_ at the office of the Cardinal-Vicar, 70 Via\r\n     della Scrofa, before 12 A.M.; upon which a day (generally Sunday)\r\n     is fixed, which must be adhered to. The Catacombs of St. Calixtus\r\n     are sometimes superficially shown without a special _permesso_. It\r\n     may be well for the visitor to provide himself with\r\n     tapers--_cerini._)\r\n\r\nAll descriptions of dangers attending a visit to the Catacombs, if\r\naccompanied by a guide, and provided with \"cerini,\" are quite imaginary.\r\nNeither does the visitor ever suffer from cold; the temperature of the\r\nCatacombs is mild and warm; the vaults are almost always dry, and the\r\nair pure.\r\n\r\n     \"The Roman Catacombs--a name consecrated by long usage, but having\r\n     no etymological meaning, and not a very determinate geographical\r\n     one--are a vast labyrinth of galleries excavated in the bowels of\r\n     the earth in the hills around the Eternal City; not in the hills on\r\n     which the city itself was built, but in those beyond the walls.\r\n     Their extent is enormous; not as to the amount of superficial soil\r\n     which they underlie, for they rarely, if ever, pass beyond the\r\n     third mile-stone from the city, but in the actual length of their\r\n     galleries; for these are often excavated on various levels, or\r\n     _piani_, three, four, or even five--one above the other; and they\r\n     cross and recross one another, sometimes at short intervals, on\r\n     each of these levels; so that, on the whole, there are certainly\r\n     not less than 350 miles of them; that is to say, if stretched out\r\n     in one continuous line, they would extend the whole length of Italy\r\n     itself. The galleries are from two to four feet in width, and vary\r\n     in height according to the nature of the rock in which they are\r\n     dug. The walls on both sides are pierced with horizontal niches,\r\n     like shelves in a bookcase or berths in a steamer, and every niche\r\n     once contained one or more dead bodies. At various intervals this\r\n     succession of shelves is interrupted for a moment, that room may be\r\n     made for a doorway opening into a small chamber; and the walls of\r\n     these chambers are generally pierced with graves in the same way as\r\n     the galleries.\r\n\r\n     \"These vast excavations once formed the ancient Christian\r\n     cemeteries of Rome; they were begun in apostolic times, and\r\n     continued to be used as burial-places of the faithful till the\r\n     capture of the city by Alaric in the year 410. In the third\r\n     century, the Roman Church numbered twenty-five or twenty-six of\r\n     them, corresponding to the number of her titles, or parishes,\r\n     within the city; and besides these, there are about twenty others,\r\n     of smaller dimensions, isolated monuments of special martyrs, or\r\n     belonging to this or that private family. Originally they all\r\n     belonged to private families or individuals, the villas or gardens\r\n     in which they were dug being the property of wealthy citizens who\r\n     had embraced the faith of Christ, and devoted of their substance to\r\n     His service. Hence their most ancient titles were taken merely from\r\n     the names of their lawful owners, many of which still survive.\r\n     Lucina, for example, who lived in the days of the Apostles, and\r\n     others of the same family, or at least of the same name, who lived\r\n     at various periods in the next two centuries; Priscilla, also a\r\n     contemporary of the Apostles; Flavia Domitilla, niece of Vespasian;\r\n     Commodilla, whose property lay on the Via Ostiensis; Cyriaca, on\r\n     the Via Tiburtina; Pretextatus, on the Via Appia; Pontiano, on the\r\n     Via Portuensis; and the Jordani, Maximus and Thraso, all on the Via\r\n     Salaria Nova. These names are still attached to the various\r\n     catacombs, because they were originally begun upon the land of\r\n     those who bore them. Other catacombs are known by the names of\r\n     those who presided over their formation, as that of St. Calixtus,\r\n     on the Via Appia; or St. Mark, on the Via Ardeatina; or of the\r\n     principal martyrs who were buried in them, as SS. Hermes, Basilla,\r\n     Protus, and Hyacinthus, on the Via Salaria Vetus; or, lastly, by\r\n     some peculiarity of their position, as _ad Catacumbas_ on the Via\r\n     Appia, and _ad duas Lauros_ on the Via Labicana.\r\n\r\n     \"It has always been agreed among men of learning who have had an\r\n     opportunity of examining these excavations, that they were used\r\n     exclusively by the Christians as places of burial and of holding\r\n     religious assemblies. Modern research has now placed it beyond a\r\n     doubt, that they were also originally designed for this purpose and\r\n     for no other: that they were not deserted sand-pits (_arenariæ_) or\r\n     quarries, adapted to Christian uses, but a development, with\r\n     important modifications, of a form of sepulchre not altogether\r\n     unknown even among the heathen families of Rome, and in common use\r\n     among the Jews both in Rome and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     \"At first, the work of making the Catacombs was done openly,\r\n     without let or hindrance, by the Christians; the entrances to them\r\n     were public on the high-road or on the hill-side, and the galleries\r\n     and chambers were freely decorated with paintings of a sacred\r\n     character. But early in the third century, it became necessary to\r\n     withdraw them as much as possible from the public eye; new and\r\n     often difficult entrances were now effected in the recesses of\r\n     deserted _arenariæ_, and even the liberty of Christian art was\r\n     cramped and fettered, lest what was holy should fall under the\r\n     profane gaze of the unbaptized.\r\n\r\n     \"Each of these burial-places was called in ancient times either\r\n     _hypogæum_, i. e. generically, a subterranean place, or\r\n     _cœmeterium_, a sleeping-place, a new name of Christian origin\r\n     which the pagans could only repeat, probably without understanding;\r\n     sometimes also _martyrium_, or _confessio_ (its Latin equivalent),\r\n     to signify that it was the burial-place of martyrs or confessors of\r\n     the faith. An ordinary grave was called _locus_ or _loculus_, if it\r\n     contained a single body; or _bisomum_, _trisomum_, or\r\n     _quadrisomum_, if it contained two, three, or four. The graves were\r\n     dug by _fossores_, and burial in them was called _depositio_. The\r\n     galleries do not seem to have had any specific name; but the\r\n     chambers were called _cubicula_. In most of these chambers, and\r\n     sometimes also in the galleries themselves, one or more tombs are\r\n     to be seen of a more elaborate kind; a long oblong _chasse_, like a\r\n     sarcophagus, either hollowed out in the rock or built up of\r\n     masonry, and closed by a heavy slab of marble lying horizontally on\r\n     the top. The niche over tombs of this kind was of the same length\r\n     as the grave, and generally vaulted in a semicircular form, whence\r\n     they were called _arcosolia_. Sometimes, however, the niche\r\n     retained the rectangular form, in which case there was no special\r\n     name for it, but for distinction's sake we may be allowed to call\r\n     it a table-tomb. Those of the _arcosolia_, which were also the tomb\r\n     of martyrs, were used on the anniversaries of their deaths\r\n     (_Natalitia_, or birthdays) as altars whereon the holy mysteries\r\n     were celebrated; hence, whilst some of the _cubicula_ were only\r\n     family-vaults, others were chapels, or places of public assembly.\r\n     It is probable that the holy mysteries were celebrated also in the\r\n     private vaults, on the anniversaries of the deaths of their\r\n     occupants; and each one was sufficiently large in itself for use on\r\n     these private occasions; but in order that as many as possible\r\n     might assist at the public celebrations, two, three, or even four\r\n     of the _cubicula_ were often made close together, all receiving\r\n     light and air through one shaft or air-hole (_luminare_), pierced\r\n     through the superincumbent soil up to the open air. In this way as\r\n     many as a hundred persons might be collected in some parts of the\r\n     catacombs to assist at the same act of public worship; whilst a\r\n     still larger number might have been dispersed in the _cubicula_ of\r\n     neighbouring galleries, and received there the bread of life\r\n     brought to them by the assistant priests and deacons. Indications\r\n     of this arrangement are not only to be found in ancient\r\n     ecclesiastical writings; they may still be seen in the very walls\r\n     of the catacombs themselves, episcopal chairs, chairs for the\r\n     presiding deacon or deaconess, and benches for the faithful, having\r\n     formed part of the original design when the chambers were hewn out\r\n     of the living rock, and still remaining where they were first\r\n     made.\"--_Roma Sotterranea, Northcote and Brownlow._\r\n\r\n     \"To our classic associations, Rome was still, under Trajan and the\r\n     Antonines, the city of the Cæsars, the metropolis of pagan\r\n     idolatry--in the pages of her poets and historians we still linger\r\n     among the triumphs of the Capitol, the shows of the Coliseum; or if\r\n     we read of a Christian being dragged before the tribunal, or\r\n     exposed to the beasts, we think of him as one of a scattered\r\n     community, few in number, spiritless in action, and politically\r\n     insignificant. But all this while there was living beneath the\r\n     visible an invisible Rome--a population unheeded,\r\n     unreckoned--thought of vaguely, vaguely spoken of, and with the\r\n     familiarity and indifference that men feel who live on a\r\n     volcano--yet a population strong-hearted, of quick impulses, nerved\r\n     alike to suffer or to die, and in number, resolution, and physical\r\n     force sufficient to have hurled their oppressors from the throne of\r\n     the world, had they not deemed it their duty to kiss the rod, to\r\n     love their enemies, to bless those that cursed them, and to submit,\r\n     for their Redeemer's sake, to the 'powers that be.' Here, in these\r\n     'dens and caves of the earth,' they lived; here they died--a\r\n     'spectacle' in their lifetime 'to men and angels,' and in their\r\n     death a 'triumph' to mankind--a triumph of which the echoes still\r\n     float around the walls of Rome, and over the desolate Campagna,\r\n     while those that once thrilled the Capitol are silenced, and the\r\n     walls that returned them have long since crumbled into\r\n     dust.\"--_Lord Lindsay' s Christian Art_, i. 4.\r\n\r\nThe name Catacombs is modern, having originally been only applied to S.\r\nSebastiano \"ad catacumbas.\" The early Christians called their\r\nburial-places by the Greek name _Cœmeteria_, sleeping-places. Almost\r\nall the catacombs are between the first and third mile-stones from the\r\nAurelian wall, to which point the city extended before the wall itself\r\nwas built. This was in obedience to the Roman law which forbade burial\r\nwithin the precincts of the city.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Christians were always anxious not to burn their dead,\r\nbut to bury them, in these rock-hewn sepulchres, was probably owing to\r\nthe remembrance that our Lord was himself laid \"in a new tomb hewn out\r\nof the rock,\" and perhaps also for this reason the bodies were wrapt in\r\nfine linen cloths, and buried with precious spices, of which remains\r\nhave been found in the tombs.\r\n\r\nThe Catacomb which is known as St. Calixtus, is composed of a number of\r\ncatacombs, once distinct, but now joined together. Such were those of\r\nSta. Lucina; of Anatolia, daughter of the consul Æmilianus; and of Sta.\r\nSoteris, \"a virgin of the family to which St. Ambrose belonged in a\r\nlater generation,\" and who was buried \"in cœmeterio suo,\" A.D. 304.\r\nThe passages of these catacombs were gradually united with those which\r\noriginally belonged to the cemetery of Calixtus.\r\n\r\nThe high mass of ruin which meets our eyes on first entering the\r\nvineyard of St. Calixtus, is a remnant of the tomb of the Cæcilii, of\r\nwhich family a number of epitaphs have been found. Beyond this is\r\nanother ruin, supposed by Marangoni to have been the basilica which St.\r\nDamasus provided for his own burial and that of his mother and sister;\r\nwhich Padre Marchi believed to be the church of St. Mark and St.\r\nMarcellinus;--but which De Rossi identifies with the _cella memoriæ_,\r\nsometimes called of St. Sistus, sometimes of St. Cecilia (because built\r\nimmediately over the graves of those martyrs), by St. Fabian in the\r\nthird century.[204]\r\n\r\nDescending into the Catacomb by an ancient staircase restored, we reach\r\n(passing a sepulchral cubiculum on the right) the _Chapel of the Popes_,\r\na place of burial and of worship of the third or fourth century, (as it\r\nwas restored after its discovery in 1854) but still retaining remains\r\nof the marble slabs with which it was faced by Sixtus III. in the fifth\r\ncentury, and of marble columns, &c. with which it was adorned by St. Leo\r\nIII. (795--816). The walls are lined with graves of the earliest popes,\r\nmany of them martyrs--viz. St. Zephyrinus, (202--211); St Pontianus, who\r\ndied in banishment in Sardinia, (231--236); St. Anteros, martyred under\r\nMaximian in the second month of his pontificate, (236); St. Fabian,\r\nmartyred under Decius, (236--250); St. Lucius, martyred under Valerian,\r\n(253--255); St. Stephen I., martyred in his episcopal chair under\r\nValerian, (255--257); St. Sixtus II., martyred in the catacombs of St.\r\nPretextatus, (257--260); St. Dionysius, (260--271); St. Eutychianus,\r\nmartyr, (275--283); and St. Caius, (284--296). Of these, the gravestones\r\nof Anteros, Fabian, Lucius, and Eutychianus, have been discovered, with\r\ninscriptions in Greek, which is acknowledged to have been the earliest\r\nlanguage of the Church,--in which St. Paul and St. James wrote, and in\r\nwhich the proceedings of the first twelve Councils were carried on.[205]\r\nThough no inscriptions have been found relating to the other popes\r\nmentioned, they are known to have been buried here from the earliest\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nOver the site of the altar is one of the beautifully-cut inscriptions of\r\nPope St. Damasus (366--384), \"whose labour of love it was to rediscover\r\nthe tombs which had been blocked up for concealment under Diocletian, to\r\nremove the earth, widen the passages, adorn the sepulchral chambers with\r\nmarble, and support the friable tufa walls with arches of brick and\r\nstone.\"[206]\r\n\r\n    \"Hic congesta jacet quæris si turba Piorum\r\n    Corpora Sanctorum retinent veneranda sepulchra,\r\n    Sublimes animas rapuit sibi Regia Cœli:\r\n    Hic comites Xysti portant qui ex hoste tropæa;\r\n    Hic numerus procerum servat qui altaria Christi;\r\n    Hic positus longâ vixit qui in pace Sacerdos;\r\n    Hic Confessores sancti quos Græcia misit;\r\n    Hic juvenes, puerique, senes, castique nepotes,\r\n    Quis mage virgineum placuit retinere pudorem.\r\n    Hic fateor Damasus volui mea condere membra,\r\n    Sed cineres timui sanctos vexare Piorum.\r\n\r\n    \"Here, if you would know, lie heaped together a number of the holy,\r\n    These honoured sepulchres inclose the bodies of the saints,\r\n    Their lofty souls the palace of heaven has received.\r\n    Here lie the companions of Xystus, who bear away the trophies\r\n     from the enemy;\r\n    Here a tribe of the elders which guards the altars of Christ;\r\n    Here is buried the priest who lived long in peace;[207]\r\n    Here the holy confessors who came from Greece;[208]\r\n    Here lie youths and boys, old men and their chaste descendants,\r\n    Who kept their virginity undefiled.\r\n    Here I Damasus wished to have laid my limbs,\r\n    But feared to disturb the holy ashes of the saints.\"[209]\r\n\r\nFrom this chapel we enter the _Cubiculum of Sta. Cecilia_, where the\r\nbody of the saint was buried by her friend Urban after her martyrdom in\r\nher own house in the Trastevere (see Chap. XVII.) A.D. 224, and where it\r\nwas discovered in 820 by Pope Paschal I. (to whom its resting-place had\r\nbeen revealed in a dream), \"fresh and perfect as when it was first laid\r\nin the tomb, and clad in rich garments mixed with gold, with linen\r\ncloths stained with blood rolled up at her feet, lying in a cypress\r\ncoffin.\"[210]\r\n\r\nClose to the entrance of the cubiculum, upon the wall, is a painting of\r\nCecilia, \"a woman richly attired, and adorned with bracelets and\r\nnecklaces.\" Near it is a niche for the lamp which burnt before the\r\nshrine, at the back of which is a large head of Our Saviour, \"of the\r\nByzantine type, and with rays of glory behind it in the form of a Greek\r\ncross. Side by side with this, but on the flat surface of the wall, is a\r\nfigure of St. Urban (the friend of Cecilia, who laid her body here) in\r\nfull pontifical robes, with his name inscribed.\" Higher on the wall are\r\nfigures of three saints, \"executed apparently in the fourth, or perhaps\r\neven the fifth century\"--Polycamus, an unknown martyr, with a palm\r\nbranch; Sebastianus; and Curinus, a bishop (Quirinus bishop of\r\nSiscia--buried at St. Sebastian). In the pavement is a gravestone of\r\nSeptimus Pretextatus Cæcilianus, \"a servant of God, who lived worthy for\r\nthree-and-thirty years;\"--considered important as suggesting a\r\nconnection between the family of Cecilia and that of St. Prætextatus, in\r\nwhose catacomb on the other side of the Appian Way her husband and\r\nbrother-in-law were buried, and where her friend St. Urban was\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nThese two chapels are the only ones which it is necessary to dwell upon\r\nhere in detail. The rest of the catacomb is shown in varying order, and\r\nexplained in different ways. Three points are of historic interest. 1.\r\nThe roof-shaped tomb of Pope St. Melchiades, who lived long in peace and\r\ndied A.D. 313. 2. The Cubiculum of Pope St. Eusebius, in the middle of\r\nwhich is placed an inscription, pagan on one side, on the other a\r\nrestoration of the fifth century of one of the beautiful inscriptions\r\nof Pope Damasus, which is thus translated:--\r\n\r\n     \"Heraclius forbade the lapsed to grieve for their sins. Eusebius\r\n     taught those unhappy ones to weep for their crimes. The people were\r\n     rent into parties, and with increasing fury began sedition,\r\n     slaughter, fighting, discord, and strife. Straightway both (the\r\n     pope and the heretic) were banished by the cruelty of the tyrant,\r\n     although the pope was preserving the bonds of peace inviolate. He\r\n     bore his exile with joy, looking to the Lord as his judge, and on\r\n     the shore of Sicily gave up the world and his life.\"\r\n\r\nAt the top and bottom of the tablet is the following title:--\r\n\r\n    \"Damasus Episcopus fecit Eusebio episcopo et martyri,\"\r\n\r\nand on either side a single file of letters which hands down to us the\r\nname of the sculptor who executed the Damasine inscriptions.\r\n\r\n    \"Furius Dionysius Filocalus scripsit Damasis pappæ cultor atque amatot.\"\r\n\r\n3. Near the exit, properly in the catacomb of Sta. Lucina, connected\r\nwith that of Calixtus by a labyrinth of galleries, is the tomb of Pope\r\nSt. Cornelius (251, 252) the only Roman bishop down to the time of St.\r\nSylvester (314) who bore the name of any noble Roman family, and whose\r\nepitaph, (perhaps in consequence) is in Latin, while those of the other\r\npopes are in Greek. The tomb has no chapel of its own, but is a mere\r\ngrave in a gallery, with a rectangular instead of a circular space\r\nabove, as in the cubicula. Near the tomb are fragments of one of the\r\ncommemorative inscriptions of St. Damasus, which has been ingeniously\r\nrestored by De Rossi thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Aspice, descensu extructo tenebrisque fugatis\r\n    Corneli monumenta vides tumulumque sacratum\r\n    Hoc opus ægroti Damasi præstantia fecit,\r\n    Esset ut accessus melior, populisque paratum\r\n    Auxilium sancti, et valeas si fundere puro\r\n    Corde preces, Damasus melior consurgere posset,\r\n    Quem non lucis amor, tenuit mage cura laboris.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Behold! a way down has been constructed, and the darkness\r\n     dispelled; you see the monuments of Cornelius, and his sacred tomb.\r\n     This work the zeal of Damasus has accomplished, sick as he is, in\r\n     order that the approach might be better, and the aid of the saint\r\n     might be made convenient for the people; and that, if you will pour\r\n     forth your prayers from a pure heart, Damasus may rise up better in\r\n     health, though it has not been love of life, but care for work,\r\n     that has kept him (here below).\"[211]\r\n\r\nSt. Cornelius was banished under Gallus to Centumcellæ--now Civita\r\nVecchia, and was brought back thence to Rome for martyrdom Sept. 14,\r\nA.D. 252. On the same day of the month, in 258, died his friend and\r\ncorrespondent St. Cyprian, archbishop of Carthage,[212] who is\r\nconsequently commemorated by the Church on the same day with St.\r\nCornelius. Therefore also, on the right of the grave, are two figures of\r\nbishops with inscriptions declaring them to be St. Cornelius and St.\r\nCyprian. Each holds the book of the Gospels in his hands and is clothed\r\nin pontifical robes, \"including the pallium, which had not yet been\r\nconfined as a mark of distinction to metropolitans.\"[213] Beneath the\r\npicture stands a pillar which held one of the vases of oil which were\r\nalways kept burning before the shrines of the martyr. Beyond the tomb,\r\nat the end of the gallery, is another painting of two bishops, St.\r\nSistus II., martyred in the catacomb of Pretextatus, and St. Optatus\r\nwho was buried near him.\r\n\r\nIn going round this catacomb, and in most of the others, the visitor\r\nwill be shown a number of rude paintings, which will be explained to him\r\nin various ways, according to the tendencies of his guide. The paintings\r\nmay be considered to consist of three classes, symbolical; allegorical\r\nand biblical; and liturgical. There is little variety of subject,--the\r\nsame are introduced over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe symbols most frequently introduced on and over the graves are:--\r\n\r\n     _The Anchor_, expressive of hope. Heb. vi. 19.\r\n\r\n     _The Dove_, symbolical of the Christian soul released from its\r\n     earthly tabernacle. Ps. lv. 6.\r\n\r\n     _The Sheep_, symbolical of the soul still wandering amid the\r\n     pastures and deserts of earthly life. Ps. cxix. 176. Isaiah liii.\r\n     6. John x. 14; xxi. 15, 16, 17.\r\n\r\n     _The Phœnix_, \"the palm bird,\" emblematical of eternity and the\r\n     resurrection.\r\n\r\n     _The Fish_--typical of Our Saviour--from the word ιχθυς, formed\r\n     by the initial letters of the titles of Our Lord--Ιησοὑς Χριστὁς\r\n     θεοὑ Υἱὁς Σωτἡρ--\"Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Saviour.\"\r\n\r\n     _The Ship_--representing the Church militant, sometimes seen\r\n     carried on the back of the fish.\r\n\r\n     _Bread_, represented with fish, sometimes carried in a basket on\r\n     its back, sometimes with it on a table--in allusion to the\r\n     multiplication of the loaves and fishes.\r\n\r\n     _A Female Figure Praying_, an \"Orante\"--in allusion to the Church.\r\n\r\n     _A Vine_--also in allusion to the Church. Ps. lxxx. 8. Isaiah v. 1.\r\n\r\n     _An Olive branch_, as a sign of peace.\r\n\r\n     _A Palm branch_, as a sign of victory and martyrdom. Rev. vii. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Allegorical and Biblical Representations._\r\n\r\nOf these _The Good Shepherd_ requires an especial notice from the\r\nimportance which is given to it and its frequent introduction in\r\ncatacomb art, both in sculpture and painting.\r\n\r\n     \"By far the most interesting of the early Christian paintings is\r\n     that of Our Saviour as the Good Shepherd, which is almost\r\n     invariably painted on the central space of the dome or cupola,\r\n     subjects of minor interest being disposed around it in\r\n     compartments, precisely in the style, as regards both the\r\n     arrangement and execution, of the heathen catacombs.\r\n\r\n     \"He is represented as a youth in a shepherd's frock and sandals,\r\n     carrying the 'lost sheep' on his shoulders, or leaning on his staff\r\n     (the symbol, according to St. Augustine, of the Christian\r\n     hierarchy), while the sheep feed around, or look up at him.\r\n     Sometimes he is represented seated in the midst of the flock,\r\n     playing on a shepherd's pipe,--in a few instances, in the oldest\r\n     catacombs, he is introduced in the character of Orpheus, surrounded\r\n     by wild beasts enrapt by the melody of his lyre,--Orpheus being\r\n     then supposed to have been a prophet or precursor of the Messiah.\r\n     The background usually exhibits a landscape or meadow, sometimes\r\n     planted with olive-trees, doves resting on their branches,\r\n     symbolical of the peace of the faithful; in others, as in a fresco\r\n     preserved in the Museum Christianum, the palm of victory is\r\n     introduced, --but such combinations are endless. In one or two\r\n     instances the surrounding compartments are filled with\r\n     personifications of the Seasons, apt emblems of human life, whether\r\n     natural or spiritual.\r\n\r\n     \"The subject of the Good Shepherd, I am sorry to add, is not of\r\n     Roman but Greek origin, and was adapted from a statue of Mercury\r\n     carrying a goat, at Tanagra, mentioned by Pausanias. The Christian\r\n     composition approximates to its original more nearly in the few\r\n     instances where Our Saviour is represented carrying a goat,\r\n     emblematical of the scapegoat of the wilderness. Singularly enough,\r\n     though of Greek parentage, and recommended to the Byzantines by\r\n     Constantine, who erected a statue of the Good Shepherd in the forum\r\n     of Constantinople, the subject did not become popular among them;\r\n     they seem, at least, to have tacitly abandoned it to Rome.\"--_Lord\r\n     Lindsay's Christian Art._\r\n\r\n     \"The Good Shepherd seems to have been quite the favourite subject.\r\n     We cannot go through any part of the Catacombs, or turn over any\r\n     collection of ancient Christian monuments, without coming across it\r\n     again and again. We know from Tertullian that it was often designed\r\n     upon chalices. We find it ourselves painted in fresco upon the\r\n     roofs and walls of the sepulchral chambers; rudely scratched upon\r\n     gravestones, or more carefully sculptured on sarcophagi; traced in\r\n     gold upon glass, moulded on lamps, engraved on rings; and, in a\r\n     word, represented on every species of Christian monument that has\r\n     come down to us. Of course, amid such a multitude of examples,\r\n     there is considerable variety of treatment. We cannot, however,\r\n     appreciate the suggestion of Kügler, that this frequent repetition\r\n     of the subject is probably to be attributed to the capabilities\r\n     which it possessed in an artistic point of view. Rather, it was\r\n     selected because it expressed the whole sum and substance of the\r\n     Christian dispensation. In the language even of the Old Testament,\r\n     the action of Divine Providence upon the world is frequently\r\n     expressed by images and allegories borrowed from pastoral life; God\r\n     is the Shepherd, and men are His sheep. But in a still more special\r\n     way our Divine Redeemer offers Himself to our regards as the Good\r\n     Shepherd. He came down from His eternal throne into this wilderness\r\n     of the world to seek the lost sheep of the whole human race, and\r\n     having brought them together into one fold on earth, thence to\r\n     transport them into the ever-verdant pastures of Paradise.\"--_Roma\r\n     Sotterranea._\r\n\r\nOther biblical subjects are:--from the _Old Testament_ (those of Noah,\r\nMoses, Daniel, and Jonah being the only ones at all common)--\r\n\r\n     1. The Fall. Adam and Eve on either side of the Tree of Knowledge,\r\n     round which the serpent is coiled. Sometimes, instead of this, \"Our\r\n     Saviour (as the representative of the Deity) stands between them,\r\n     condemning them, and offering a lamb to Eve and a sheaf of corn to\r\n     Adam, to signify the doom of themselves and their posterity to\r\n     delve and to spin through all future ages.\"\r\n\r\n     2. The Offering of Cain and Abel. They present a lamb and sheaf of\r\n     corn to a seated figure of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n     3. Noah in the Ark, represented as a box--a dove, bearing an\r\n     olive-branch, flies towards him. Interpreted to express the\r\n     doctrine that \"the faithful having obtained remission of their sins\r\n     through baptism, have received from the Holy Spirit the gift of\r\n     divine peace, and are saved in the mystical ark of the church from\r\n     the destruction which awaits the world.\"[214] (Acts ii. 47.)\r\n\r\n     4. Sacrifice of Isaac.\r\n\r\n     5. Passage of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n     6. Moses receiving the Law.\r\n\r\n     7. Moses striking water from the rock--(very common).\r\n\r\n     8. Moses pointing to the pots of manna.\r\n\r\n     9. Elijah going up to heaven in the chariot of fire.\r\n\r\n     10. The Three Children in the fiery furnace;--very common as\r\n     symbolical of martyrdom.\r\n\r\n     11. Daniel in the lions' den;--generally a naked figure with hands\r\n     extended, and a lion on either side; most common--as an\r\n     encouragement to Christian sufferers.\r\n\r\n     12. Jonah swallowed up by the whale, represented as a strange kind\r\n     of sea-horse.\r\n\r\n     13. Jonah disgorged by the whale.\r\n\r\n     14. Jonah under the gourd; or, according to the Vulgate, under the\r\n     ivy.\r\n\r\n     15. Jonah lamenting for the death of the gourd.\r\n\r\n     These four subjects from the story of Jonah are constantly\r\n     repeated, perhaps as encouragement to the Christians suffering from\r\n     the wickedness of Rome--the modern Nineveh, which they were to warn\r\n     and pray for.\r\n\r\nSubjects from the _New Testament_ are:\r\n\r\n     1. The Nativity--the ox and the ass kneeling.\r\n\r\n     2. The Adoration of the Magi--repeatedly placed in juxtaposition\r\n     with the story of the Three Children.\r\n\r\n     3. Our Saviour turning water into wine.\r\n\r\n     4. Our Saviour conversing with the woman of Samaria.\r\n\r\n     5. Our Saviour healing the paralytic man--who takes up his bed.\r\n     This is very common.\r\n\r\n     6. Our Saviour healing the woman with the issue of blood.\r\n\r\n     7. Our Saviour multiplying the loaves and fishes.\r\n\r\n     8. Our Saviour healing the daughter of the woman of Canaan.\r\n\r\n     9. Our Saviour healing the blind man.\r\n\r\n     10. The raising of Lazarus, who appears at a door in his\r\n     grave-clothes, while Christ with a wand stands before it. This is\r\n     the New Testament subject oftenest introduced. It is constantly\r\n     placed in juxtaposition with a picture of Moses striking the rock.\r\n     \"These two subjects may be intended to represent the beginning and\r\n     end of the Christian course, 'the fountain of water springing up to\r\n     life everlasting.' God's grace and the gift of faith being typified\r\n     by the water flowing from the rock, 'which was Christ,' and life\r\n     everlasting by the victory over death and the second life\r\n     vouchsafed to Lazarus.\"[215]\r\n\r\n     11. Our Saviour's triumphal entry into Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n     12. Our Saviour giving the keys to Peter--very rare.\r\n\r\n     13. Our Saviour predicting the denial of Peter.\r\n\r\n     14. The denial of Peter.\r\n\r\n     15. Our Saviour before Pilate.\r\n\r\n     16. St.Peter taken to prison.\r\n\r\n     These last six subjects are only represented on tombs.[216]\r\n\r\nThe class of paintings shown as _Liturgical_ are less definite than\r\nthese. In the Catacombs of Calixtus several obscure paintings are shown\r\n(in cubicula anterior to the middle of the third century), which are\r\nsaid to have reference to the sacrament of baptism. Pictures of the\r\nparalytic carrying his bed are identified by some Roman Catholic\r\nauthorities with the sacrament of penance. (!) Bosio believed that in\r\nthe Catacomb of Sta. Priscilla he had found paintings which illustrated\r\nthe sacrament of ordination. Representations undoubtedly exist which\r\nillustrate the _agape_ or love-feast of the primitive Church.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the Via Appia from St. Calixtus (generally\r\nentered from the road leading to S. Urbano) is the _Catacomb of St.\r\nPretextatus_, interesting as being the known burial-place of several\r\nmartyrs. A large crypt was discovered here in 1857, built with solid\r\nmasonry and lined with Greek marble.\r\n\r\n     \"The workmanship points to early date, and specimens of pagan\r\n     architecture in the same neighbourhood enable us to fix the middle\r\n     of the latter half of the second century (A.D. 175) as a very\r\n     probable date for its erection. The Acts of the Saints explain to\r\n     us why it was built with bricks, and not hewn out of the rock--viz.\r\n     because the Christian who made it (Sta. Marmenia) had caused it to\r\n     be excavated immediately below her own house; and now that we see\r\n     it, we understand the precise meaning of the words used by the\r\n     itineraries describing it--viz. 'a large cavern, most firmly\r\n     built.' The vault of the chapel is most elaborately painted, in a\r\n     style by no means inferior to the best classical productions of the\r\n     age. It is divided into four bands of wreaths, one of roses,\r\n     another of corn-sheaves, a third of vine-leaves and grapes (and in\r\n     all these, birds are introduced visiting their young in nests), and\r\n     the last or highest, of leaves of laurel or the bay-tree. Of course\r\n     these severally represent the seasons of spring, summer, autumn,\r\n     and winter. The last is a well-known figure or symbol of death; and\r\n     probably the laurel, as the token of victory, was intended to\r\n     represent the new and Christian idea of the everlasting reward of a\r\n     blessed immortality. Below these bands is another border, more\r\n     indistinct, in which reapers are gathering in the corn; and at the\r\n     back of the arch is a rural scene, of which the central figure is\r\n     the Good Shepherd carrying a sheep upon his shoulders. This,\r\n     however, has been destroyed by graves pierced through the wall and\r\n     the rock behind it, from the eager desire to bury the dead of a\r\n     later generation as near as possible to the tombs of the martyrs.\r\n     As De Rossi proceeded to examine these graves in detail, he could\r\n     hardly believe his eyes when he read around the edge of one of them\r\n     these words and fragments of words:--_Mi Refrigeri Januarius\r\n     Agatopos Felicissim Martyres_--'Januarius, Agapetus, Felicissimus,\r\n     martyrs, refresh the soul of....' The words had been scratched upon\r\n     the mortar while it was yet fresh, fifteen centuries ago, as the\r\n     prayer of some bereaved relative for the soul of him whom they were\r\n     burying here, and now they revealed to the antiquarian of the\r\n     nineteenth century the secret he was in quest of--viz. the place of\r\n     burial of the saints whose aid is here invoked; for the numerous\r\n     examples to be seen in other cemeteries warrant us in concluding\r\n     that the bodies of the saints, to whose intercession the soul of\r\n     the deceased is here recommended, were at the time of his burial\r\n     lying at no great distance.\"--_Roma Sotterranea._\r\n\r\nThe St. Januarius buried here was the eldest of the seven sons of St.\r\nFelicitas, martyred July 10, A.D. 162. St. Agapitus and St. Felicissimus\r\nwere deacons of Pope Sixtus II., who were martyred together with him and\r\nSt. Pretextatus[217] in this very catacomb, because Sixtus II. \"had set\r\nat nought the commands of the Emperor Valerian.\"[218]\r\n\r\nA mutilated inscription of St. Damasus, in the Catacomb of Calixtus,\r\nnear the tomb of Cornelius, thus records the death of this pope:\r\n\r\n    \"Tempore quo gladius secuit pia visura Matris\r\n    Hic positus rector cælestia jussa docebam;\r\n    Adveniunt subito, rapiunt qui forte sedentem;\r\n    Militibus missis, populi tunc colla dedere.\r\n    Mox sibi cognovit senior quis tollere vellet\r\n    Palmam seque suumque caput prior obtulit ipse,\r\n    Impatiens feritas posset ne lædere quemquam.\r\n    Ostendit Christus reddit qui præmia vitæ\r\n    Pastoris meritum, numerum gregis ipse tuetur.\"\r\n\r\n     \"At the time when the sword pierced the heart of our Mother\r\n     (Church), I, its ruler, buried here, was teaching the things of\r\n     heaven. Suddenly they came, they seized me seated as I was;--the\r\n     soldiers being sent in, the people gave their necks (to the\r\n     slaughter). Soon the old man saw who was willing to bear away the\r\n     palm from himself, and was the first to offer himself and his own\r\n     head, fearing lest the blow should fall on any one else. Christ who\r\n     awards the rewards of life recognises the merit of the pastor, he\r\n     himself is preserving the number of his flock.\"\r\n\r\nAn adjoining crypt, considered to date from A.D. 130, is believed to be\r\nthe burial-place of St. Quirinus.\r\n\r\nAbove this catacomb are ruins of two basilicas, erected in honour of St.\r\nZeno; and of Tiburtius, Valerian, and Maximus, companions of Sta.\r\nCecilia in martyrdom.\r\n\r\nIn the road leading to S. Urbano is the entrance to the _Jewish\r\nCatacomb_. It is entered by a chamber open to the sky, floored with\r\nblack and white mosaic, which is supposed to have formed part of a pagan\r\ndwelling. The following chamber has remains of a well. Hence a low door\r\nforms the entrance of a gallery out of which open six cubicula, one of\r\nthem containing a fine while marble sarcophagus, and decorated with a\r\npainting of the seven-branched candlestick. A side passage leads to\r\nother cubicula, and to an open space which seems to have been an actual\r\narenarium. A winding passage at the end of the larger gallery leads to\r\nthe graves in the floor divided into different cells for corpses, and\r\ncalled _Cocim_ by Rabbinical writers. A cubiculum at the end of the\r\ncatacomb has paintings of figures--Plenty, with a cornucopia; Victory,\r\nwith a palm leaf, &c. The inscriptions found show that this cemetery was\r\nexclusively Jewish. They refer to officers of the synagogue, rulers\r\n(αρχοντες), and scribes (γραμματεις), &c. The inscriptions are in great\r\npart in Greek letters, expressing Latin words.\r\n\r\nAnother small Jewish catacomb has been discovered behind the basilica of\r\nSt. Sebastian. Behind the Catacomb of St. Calixtus, on the right of the\r\nVia Ardeatina, is the _Catacomb of SS. Nereo ed Achilleo_. Close to its\r\nentrance is the farm of _Tor Marancia_, where are some ruins, believed\r\nto be remains of the villa of Flavia Domitilla. This celebrated member\r\nof the early Christian Church was daughter of the Flavia Domitilla who\r\nwas sister of the Emperor Domitian,--and wife of Titus Flavius Clemens,\r\nson of the Titus Flavius Sabinus who was brother of the Emperor\r\nVespasian. Her two sons were, Vespasian Junior and Domitian Junior, who\r\nwere intended to succeed to the throne, and to whom Quinctilian was\r\nappointed as tutor by the emperor. Dion Cassius narrates that \"Domitian\r\nput to death several persons, and amongst them Flavius Clemens the\r\nconsul, although he was his nephew, and although he had Flavia Domitilla\r\nfor his wife, who was also related to the emperor. They were both\r\naccused of atheism, on which charge many others also had been\r\ncondemned, going after the manners and customs of the Jew; and some of\r\nthem were put to death, and others had their goods confiscated; but\r\nDomitilla was only banished to Pandataria.\"[219] This Flavia Domitilla\r\nis frequently confused with her niece of the same name,[220] whose\r\nbanishment is mentioned by Eusebius, when he says:--\"The teaching of our\r\nfaith had by this time shone so far and wide, that even pagan historians\r\ndid not refuse to insert in their narratives some account of the\r\npersecution and the martyrdoms that were suffered in it. Some, too, have\r\nmarked the time accurately, mentioning, amongst many others, in the\r\nfifteenth year of Domitian (A.D. 97), Flavia Domitilla, the daughter of\r\na sister of Flavius Clemens, one of the Roman consuls of those days,\r\nwho, for her testimony for Christ, was punished by exile to the island\r\nof Pontia.\" It was this younger Domitilla who was accompanied in her\r\nexile by her two Christian servants, Nereus and Achilles; whose\r\nbanishment is spoken of by St. Jerome as \"a life-long martyrdom,\"--whose\r\ncell was afterwards visited by Sta. Paula,[221] and who, according to\r\nthe Acts of SS. Nereus and Achilles, was brought back to the mainland to\r\nbe burnt alive at Terracina, because she refused to sacrifice to idols.\r\nThe relics of Domitilla, with those of her servants, were preserved in\r\nthe catacomb under the villa which had belonged to her Christian aunt.\r\n\r\nReceiving as evidence the story of Sta. Domitilla, this catacomb must be\r\nlooked upon as the oldest Christian cemetery in existence. Its galleries\r\nwere widened and strengthened by John I. (523--526). A chamber near the\r\nentrance is pointed out as the burial-place of Sta. Petronilla.\r\n\r\n     \"The sepulchre of SS. Nereus and Achilles was in all probability in\r\n     that chapel to which we descend by so magnificent a staircase, and\r\n     which is illuminated by so fine a _luminare_; for that this is the\r\n     central point of attraction in the cemetery is clear, both from the\r\n     staircase and the luminare just mentioned, as also from the greater\r\n     width of the adjacent galleries and other similar tokens.\" Here\r\n     then St. Gregory the Great delivered his twenty-eighth homily\r\n     (which Baronius erroneously supposes to have been delivered in the\r\n     Church of SS. Nereo ed Achilleo, to which the bodies of the saints\r\n     were not yet removed), in which he says--\"These saints, before\r\n     whose tomb we are assembled, despised the world and trampled it\r\n     under their feet, when peace, plenty, riches, and health gave it\r\n     charms.\"\r\n\r\n     \" ... There is a higher and more ancient _piano_, in which coins\r\n     and medals of the first two centuries, and inscriptions of great\r\n     value, have been recently discovered. Some of these inscriptions\r\n     may still be seen in one of the chambers near the bottom of the\r\n     staircase; they are both Latin and Greek; sometimes both languages\r\n     are mixed; and in one or two instances Latin words are written in\r\n     Greek characters. Many of these monuments are of the deepest\r\n     importance both in an antiquarian and religious point of view; in\r\n     archaeology, as showing the practice of private Christians in the\r\n     first ages to make the subterranean chambers at their own expense\r\n     and for their own use, _e. g._--'M. Aurelius Restutus made this\r\n     subterranean for himself, and those of his family who believed in\r\n     the Lord,'--where, both the triple names and the limitation\r\n     introduced at the end (which shows that many of his family were\r\n     still pagan), are unquestionably proofs of very high\r\n     antiquity.\"--_Northcote's Roman Catacombs_, p. 103, &c.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable paintings in this catacomb are, Orpheus with\r\nhis lyre, surrounded by birds and beasts who are charmed with his music;\r\nElijah ascending to heaven in a chariot drawn by four horses; and the\r\nportrait of Our Lord.\r\n\r\n     \"The head and bust of our Lord form a medallion, occupying the\r\n     centre of the roof in the same _cubiculum_ where Orpheus is\r\n     represented. This painting, in consequence of the description\r\n     given of it by Kügler (who misnamed the catacomb St. Calixtus), is\r\n     often eagerly sought after by strangers visiting the catacombs. It\r\n     is only just, however, to add, that they are generally\r\n     disappointed. Kügler supposed it to be the oldest portrait of Our\r\n     Blessed Saviour in existence, but we doubt if there is sufficient\r\n     authority for such a statement. He describes it in these\r\n     words:--'The face is oval, with a straight nose, arched eyebrows, a\r\n     smooth and rather high forehead, the expression serious and mild;\r\n     the hair, parted on the forehead, flows in long curls down the\r\n     shoulders; the beard is not thick, but short and divided; the age\r\n     between thirty and forty.' But this description is too minute and\r\n     precise, too artistic, for the original, as it is now to be seen. A\r\n     lively imagination may, perhaps, supply the details described by\r\n     our author, but the eye certainly fails to distinguish\r\n     them.\"--_Roma Sotterranea_, p. 253.\r\n\r\nApproached by a separate entrance on the slope of the hill-side is a\r\nsepulchral chamber, which De Rossi considers to have been the\r\n_Burial-place of Sta. Domitilla_.\r\n\r\n     \"It is certainly one of the most ancient and remarkable Christian\r\n     monuments yet discovered. Its position, close to the highway; its\r\n     front of fine brickwork, with a cornice of terra-cotta, with the\r\n     usual space for an inscription (which has now, alas, perished); the\r\n     spaciousness of its gallery, with its four or five separate niches\r\n     prepared for as many sarcophagi; the fine stucco on the wall; the\r\n     eminently classical character of its decorations; all these things\r\n     make it perfectly clear that it was the monument of a Christian\r\n     family of distinction, excavated at great cost, and without the\r\n     slightest attempt at concealment. In passing from the vestibule\r\n     into the catacomb, we recognise the transition from the use of the\r\n     sarcophagus to that of the common _loculus_; for the first two or\r\n     three graves on either side, though really mere shelves in the\r\n     wall, are so disguised by painting on the outside as to present to\r\n     passers-by the complete outward appearance of a sarcophagus. Some\r\n     few of these graves are marked with the names of the dead, written\r\n     in black on the largest tiles, and the inscriptions on the other\r\n     graves are all of the simplest and oldest form. Lastly, the whole\r\n     of the vaulted roof is covered with the most exquisitely graceful\r\n     designs, of branches of the vine (with birds and winged genii among\r\n     them) trailing with all the freedom of nature over the whole walls,\r\n     not fearing any interruption by graves, nor confined by any of\r\n     those lines of geometrical symmetry which characterise similar\r\n     productions in the next century. Traces also of landscapes may be\r\n     seen here and there, which are of rare occurrence in the catacombs,\r\n     though they may be seen in the chambers assigned by De Rossi to SS.\r\n     Nereus and Achilles. The Good Shepherd, an _agape_, or the heavenly\r\n     feast, a man fishing, and Daniel in the lions' den, are the chief\r\n     historical or allegorical representations of Christian mysteries\r\n     which are painted here. Unfortunately they have been almost\r\n     destroyed by persons attempting to detach them from the\r\n     wall.\"--_Roma Sotterranea_, p. 70.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA road to the left now leads to the Via Appia Nuova, passing about a\r\nquarter of a mile hence, a turn on the left to the ruin generally known\r\nas the _Temple of Bacchus_, from an altar dedicated to Bacchus which was\r\nfound there, but considered by modern antiquaries as a temple of Ceres\r\nand Proserpine. This building has been comparatively saved from the\r\ndestruction which has befallen its neighbours by having been consecrated\r\nas a church in A.D. 820 by Pope Pascal I., in honour of his sainted\r\npredecessor Urban I., A.D. 226--whose pontificate was chiefly passed in\r\nrefuge in the neighbouring Catacomb of St. Calixtus--because of a belief\r\nthat he was wont to resort hither.\r\n\r\nA chapel at a great depth below the church, is shown as that in which\r\nSt. Urban baptized and celebrated mass. A curious fresco here represents\r\nthe Virgin between St. Urban and St. John.\r\n\r\nAround the upper part of the interior are a much injured series of\r\nfrescoes, comprising--the life of Christ from the Annunciation to the\r\ndescent into Hades,--and the life of St. Cecilia and her husband\r\nValerian, ending in the burial of Cecilia by Pope Urban in the Catacombs\r\nof Calixtus, and the story of the martyred Urban I. In the picture of\r\nthe Crucifixion, the thieves have their names, \"Calpurnius and\r\nLonginus.\" The frescoes were altered in the seventeenth century to suit\r\nthe views of the Roman Church, keys being placed in the hand of Peter,\r\n&c. Sets of drawings taken _before_ and _after_ the alterations, are\r\npreserved in the Barberini Library, and curiously show the difference.\r\n\r\nA winding path leads from S. Urbano into the valley. Here, beside the\r\nAlmo rivulet, is a ruined Nymphæum containing a mutilated statue of a\r\nriver-god, which was called \"the Grotto of Egeria,\" till a few years\r\nago, when the discovery of the true site of the Porta Capena fixed that\r\nof the grotto within the walls. The fine grove of old ilex-trees on the\r\nhillside, was at the same time pointed out as the sacred grove of\r\nEgeria.\r\n\r\n    \"Egeria! sweet creation of some heart\r\n    Which found no mortal resting-place so fair\r\n    As thine ideal breast; whate'er thou art\r\n    Or wert,--a young Aurora of the air,\r\n    The nympholepsy of some fond despair;\r\n    Or, it might be, a beauty of the earth,\r\n    Who found a more than common votary there\r\n    Too much adoring; whatsoe'er thy birth,\r\n    Thou wert a beautiful thought, and softly bodied forth.\r\n\r\n    \"The mosses of thy fountain still are sprinkled\r\n    With thine Elysian water-drops; the face\r\n    Of thy cave-guarded spring, with years unwrinkled,\r\n    Reflects the meek-eyed genius of the place,\r\n    Whose green, wild margin now no more erase\r\n    Art's works; nor must the delicate waters sleep,\r\n    Prisoned in marble, bubbling from the base\r\n    Of the cleft statue, with a gentle leap\r\n    The rill runs o'er, and round, fern, flowers, and ivy, creep,\r\n\r\n    \"Fantastically tangled; the green hills\r\n    Are clothed with early blossoms, through the grass\r\n    The quick-eyed lizard rustles, and the bills\r\n    Of summer-birds sing welcome as ye pass;\r\n    Flowers fresh in hue, and many in their class,\r\n    Implore the pausing step, and with their dyes\r\n    Dance in the soft breeze in a fairy mass;\r\n    The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes,\r\n    Kiss'd by the breath of heaven, seems coloured by its skies.\"\r\n\r\n    _Byron, Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nIt is now known that this nymphæum and the valley in which it stands\r\nbelonged to the suburban villa called Triopio, of Herodes Atticus, whose\r\nromantic story is handed down to us through two Greek inscriptions in\r\nthe possession of the Borghese family, and is further illustrated by the\r\nwritings of Filostratus and Pausanias.\r\n\r\n     A wealthy Greek named Ipparchus offended his government and lost\r\n     all his wealth by confiscation, but the family fortunes were\r\n     redeemed, through the discovery by his son Atticus of a vast\r\n     treasure, concealed in a small piece of ground which remained to\r\n     them, close to the rock of the Acropolis. Dreading the avarice of\r\n     his fellow-citizens, Atticus sent at once to Nerva, the then\r\n     emperor, telling him of the discovery, and requesting his orders as\r\n     to what he was to do with the treasure. Nerva replied, that he was\r\n     welcome to keep it, and use it as he pleased. Not yet satisfied or\r\n     feeling sufficiently sure of the protection of the emperor, Atticus\r\n     again applied to him, saying that the treasure was far too vast for\r\n     the use of a person in a private station of life, and asking how he\r\n     was to use it. The emperor again replied that the treasure was his\r\n     own and due to his own good fortune, and that \"what he could not\r\n     use he might abuse.\" Atticus then entered securely into possession\r\n     of his wealth, which he bequeathed to his son Herodes, who used his\r\n     fortune magnificently in his bountiful charities, in the\r\n     encouragement of literature and art throughout both Greece and\r\n     Italy, and (best appreciated of all by the Greeks) in the splendour\r\n     of the public games which he gave.\r\n\r\n     Early in the reign of Antoninus Pius, Herodes Atticus removed to\r\n     Rome, where he was appointed professor of rhetoric to Marcus\r\n     Aurelius and Lucius Verus, the two adopted sons of the emperor, and\r\n     where he attained the consulship in A.D. 143. Soon after his\r\n     arrival he fell in love with Annia Regilla, a beautiful and wealthy\r\n     heiress, and in spite of the violent opposition of her brother,\r\n     Annius Attilius Braduas, who, belonging to the Julian family, and\r\n     claiming an imaginary descent from Venus and Anchises, looked upon\r\n     the marriage as a mesalliance, he succeeded in obtaining her hand.\r\n     Part of the wealth which Annia Regilla brought to her husband was\r\n     the Valle Caffarelli and its nymphæum.\r\n\r\n     For some years Herodes Atticus and Annia Regilla enjoyed the\r\n     perfection of married happiness in this beautiful valley; but\r\n     shortly before the expected birth of her fifth child, she died very\r\n     suddenly, leaving her husband almost frantic with grief and\r\n     refusing every consolation. He was roused, however, from his first\r\n     anguish by his brother-in-law Annius Braduas, who had never laid\r\n     aside his resentment at the marriage, and who now accused him of\r\n     having poisoned his wife. Herodes demanded a public trial, and was\r\n     acquitted. Filostratus records that the intense grief he showed and\r\n     the depth of the mourning he wore, were taken as signs of his\r\n     innocence. Further to clear himself from imputation, Herodes\r\n     offered all the jewels of Annia Regilla upon the altar of the\r\n     Eleusinian deities, Ceres and Proserpine, at the same time calling\r\n     down the vengeance of the outraged gods if he were guilty of\r\n     sacrilege.\r\n\r\n     The beloved Regilla was buried in a tomb surrounded by \"a\r\n     sepulchral field\" within the precincts of the villa, dedicated to\r\n     Minerva and Nemesis, and (as recorded in one of the Greek\r\n     inscriptions) it was made an act of the highest sacrilege, for any\r\n     but her own descendants to be laid within those sacred limits. A\r\n     statue was also erected to Regilla in the Triopian temple of Ceres\r\n     and Proserpine, which is now supposed to be the same with that\r\n     usually called the temple of Bacchus. Not only did Herodes hang his\r\n     house with black in his affliction, but all gaily coloured marbles\r\n     were stripped from the walls, and replaced with the dark grey\r\n     marble known as \"bardiglio,\"--and his depth of woe made him so\r\n     conspicuous, that a satirical person seeing his cook prepare white\r\n     beans for dinner, wondered that he could dare to do so in a house\r\n     so entirely black.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions in which this story is related (one of them containing\r\nthirty-nine Greek verses) are engraved on slabs of Pentelic marble--and\r\nPhilostratus and Pausanias narrate that the quarries of this marble were\r\nthe property of Herodes, and that in his magnificent buildings he almost\r\nexhausted them.[222]\r\n\r\nThe field path from hence leads back to the Church of Domine Quo Vadis,\r\npassing on the right a beautifully-finished tomb (of the time of\r\nSeptimius Severus) known as the _Temple of Divus Rediculus_, and\r\nformerly described as having been built to commemorate the retreat of\r\nHannibal, who came thus far in his intended attack upon Rome. The temple\r\nerected in memory of this event was really on the right of the Via\r\nAppia. It was dedicated to Rediculus, the god of Return. The folly of\r\nciceroni often cites this name as \"Ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\n     The neighbourhood of the Divus Rediculus (which he however places\r\n     on the _right_ of the Via Appia) is described by Pliny in\r\n     connection with a curious story of imperial times. There was a\r\n     cobbler who had his stall in the Roman Forum, and who possessed a\r\n     tame raven, which was a great favourite with the young Romans, to\r\n     whom he would bid good day as he sate perched upon the rostra. At\r\n     length he became quite a public character, and the indignation was\r\n     so great when his master killed him with his hammer in a fit of\r\n     rage at his spoiling some new leather, that they slew the cobbler\r\n     and decreed a public funeral to the bird; who was carried to the\r\n     grave on a bier adorned with honorary crowns, preceded by a piper,\r\n     and supported by two negroes in honour of his colour,--and\r\n     buried--\"ad rogum usque, qui constructus dextrâ Viæ Appiæ ad\r\n     secundum lapidem in campo Rediculo appellate fuit.\"--_Pliny, Nat.\r\n     Hist._ lib. x. c. 60.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning to the Via Appia, we reach, on the right, the _Basilica of S.\r\nSebastiano_, rebuilt in 1611 by Flaminio Ponzio for Cardinal Scipio\r\nBorghese on the site of a church which had been founded by Constantine,\r\nwhere once existed the house and garden of the matron Lucina, in which\r\nshe had buried the body of Sebastian, after his (second) martyrdom under\r\nDiocletian. The basilica contains nothing ancient, but the six granite\r\ncolumns in the portico. The altar covers the relics of the saint (a\r\nGaul, a native of Narbonne, a Christian soldier under Diocletian) and\r\nthe chapel of St. Sebastian has a statue of him in his youth, designed\r\nby Bernini and executed by Antonio Giorgetti.\r\n\r\n     \"The almost colossal form lies dead, the head resting on his helmet\r\n     and armour. It is evidently modelled from nature, and is perhaps\r\n     the finest thing ever designed by Bernini.... It is probably from\r\n     the association of arrows with his form and story that St.\r\n     Sebastian has been regarded from the first ages of Christianity as\r\n     the protecting saint against plague and pestilence; Apollo was the\r\n     deity who inflicted plague, and therefore was invoked with prayer\r\n     and sacrifice against it; and to the honour of Apollo, in this\r\n     particular character, St. Sebastian has succeeded.\"--_Jameson's\r\n     Sacred Art_, p. 414.\r\n\r\nThe original of the footprint in the Domine Quo Vadis is said to be\r\npreserved here.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the entrance is the descent into the catacombs, with the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n     \"In hoc sacrosancto loco qui dicitur ad Catacumbas, ubi sepulta\r\n     fuerunt sanctorum martyrum corpora 174,000 ac 46 summorum\r\n     pontificium pariterque martyrum.

Its only\r\n     interest consists in its religious associations: here St. Bridget\r\n     was wont to kneel, rapt in contemplation; here St. Charles Borromeo\r\n     spent whole nights in prayer; and here the heart of St. Philip Neri\r\n     was so inflamed with divine love as to cause his very bodily frame\r\n     to be changed.\"--_Northcote's Roman Catacombs._\r\n\r\n    \"Philip, on thee the glowing ray\r\n      Of heaven came down upon thy prayer,\r\n    To melt thy heart, and burn away\r\n      All that of earthly dross was there.\r\n\r\n    \"And so, on Philip when we gaze,\r\n      We see the image of his Lord;\r\n    The saint dissolves amid the blaze\r\n      Which circles round the Living Word.\r\n\r\n    \"The meek, the wise, none else is here,\r\n      Dispensing light to men below;\r\n    His awful accents fill the ear,\r\n      Now keen as fire, now soft as snow.\"\r\n\r\n    _J. H. Newman_, 1850.\r\n\r\nOwing to the desire in the early Christian Church of saving the graves\r\nof their first confessors and martyrs from desecration, almost all the\r\ncatacombs were gradually blocked up, and by lapse of time their very\r\nentrances were forgotten. In the fourteenth century very few were still\r\nopen. In the fifteenth century none remained except this of St.\r\nSebastian, which continued to be frequented by pilgrims, and was called\r\nin all ancient documents \"cœmeterium ad catacumbas.\"\r\n\r\nAt the back of the high-altar is an interesting half-subterranean\r\nbuilding, attributed to Pope Liberius (352--355), and afterwards adorned\r\nby Pope Damasus, who briefly tells its history in one of his\r\ninscriptions, which may still be seen here:\r\n\r\n    \"Hinc habitasse prius sanctos cognoscere debes,\r\n    Nomina quisque Petri pariter Paulique requiris.\r\n    Discipulos Oriens misit, quod sponte fatemur,\r\n    Sanguinis ob meritum Christumque per astra sequuti,\r\n    Aetherios petiere sinus et regna piorum.\r\n    Roma suos potius meruit defendere cives.\r\n    Hæc Damasus vestras referat sidera laudes.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Here you should know that saints dwelt. Their names, if you ask\r\n     them, were Peter and Paul. The East sent disciples, which we freely\r\n     acknowledge. For the merit of their blood they followed Christ to\r\n     the stars, and sought the heavenly home and the kingdom of the\r\n     blest. Rome however deserved to defend her own citizens. May\r\n     Damasus record these things for your praise, O new stars.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The two Apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, were originally buried,\r\n     the one at the Vatican, the other on the Ostian Way, at the spot\r\n     where their respective basilicas now stand; but, as soon as the\r\n     Oriental Christians had heard of their death, they sent some of\r\n     their brethren to remove their bodies, and bring them back to the\r\n     East, where they considered that they had a right to claim them as\r\n     their fellow-citizens and countrymen. These so far prospered in\r\n     their mission as to gain a momentary possession of the sacred\r\n     relics, which they carried off, along the Appian Way, as far as the\r\n     spot where the church of St. Sebastian was afterwards built. Here\r\n     they rested for a while, to make all things ready for their\r\n     journey, or, according to another account, were detained by a\r\n     thunderstorm of extraordinary violence, which delay, however\r\n     occasioned, was sufficient to enable the Christians of Rome to\r\n     overtake them and recover their lost treasure. These Roman\r\n     Christians then buried the bodies, with the utmost secrecy, in a\r\n     deep pit, which they dug on the very spot where they were. Soon,\r\n     indeed, they were restored to their original places of sepulture,\r\n     as we know from contemporary authorities, and there seems reason to\r\n     believe the old ecclesiastical tradition to be correct, which\r\n     states them to have only remained in this temporary abode for a\r\n     year and seven months. The body of St. Peter, however, was destined\r\n     to revisit it a second time, and for a longer period; for when, at\r\n     the beginning of the third century, Heliogabalus made his circus at\r\n     the Vatican, Calixtus, who was then pope, removed the relics of the\r\n     Apostle to their former temporary resting-place, the pit on the\r\n     Appian Way. But in A.D. 257, St. Stephen, the pope, having been\r\n     discovered in this very cemetery and having suffered martyrdom\r\n     there, the body of St. Peter was once more removed, and restored to\r\n     its original tomb in the Vatican.\"--_Northcote's Roman Catacombs._\r\n\r\nIn the passages of this catacomb are misguiding inscriptions placed here\r\nin 1409 by William, Archbishop of Bourges, calling upon the faithful to\r\nvenerate _here_ the tombs of Sta. Cecilia and of many of the martyred\r\npopes, who are buried elsewhere. The martyr St. Cyrinus is known to have\r\nbeen buried here from very early itineraries, but his grave has not been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n     \"When I was a boy, being educated at Rome, I used every Sunday, in\r\n     company with other boys of my own age and tastes, to visit the\r\n     tombs of the apostles and martyrs, and to go into the crypts\r\n     excavated there in the bowels of the earth. The walls on either\r\n     side as you enter are full of the bodies of the dead, and the whole\r\n     place is so dark, that one seems almost to see the fulfilment of\r\n     those words of the prophet, 'Let them go down alive into Hades.'\r\n     Here and there a little light, admitted from above, suffices to\r\n     give a momentary relief to the horror of the darkness; but as you\r\n     go forwards, and find yourself again immersed in the utter\r\n     blackness of night, the words of the poet come spontaneously to\r\n     your mind: 'The very silence fills the soul with dread.'\"--_St.\r\n     Jerome_ (A.D. 354), _In Ezek._ ch. lx.\r\n\r\n     \"A gaunt Franciscan friar, with a wild bright eye, was our only\r\n     guide down into this profound and dreadful place. The narrow ways\r\n     and openings hither and thither, coupled with the dead and heavy\r\n     air, soon blotted out, in all of us, any recollection of the track\r\n     by which we had come; and I could not help thinking, 'Good Heaven,\r\n     if in a sudden fit of madness he should dash the torches out, or if\r\n     he should be seized with a fit, what would become of us!' On we\r\n     wandered, among martyrs' graves: passing great subterranean vaulted\r\n     roads, diverging in all directions, and choked up with heaps of\r\n     stones, that thieves and murderers may not take refuge there, and\r\n     form a population under Rome, even worse than that which lives\r\n     between it and the sun. Graves, graves, graves; graves of men, of\r\n     women, of little children, who ran crying to the persecutors, 'We\r\n     are Christians! we are Christians!' that they might be murdered\r\n     with their parents; graves with the palm of martyrdom roughly cut\r\n     into their stone boundaries, and little niches, made to hold a\r\n     vessel of the martyr's blood; graves of some who lived down here,\r\n     for years together, ministering to the rest, and preaching truth,\r\n     and hope, and comfort, from the rude altars, that bear witness to\r\n     their fortitude at this hour; more roomy graves, but far more\r\n     terrible, where hundreds, being surprised, were hemmed in and\r\n     walled up; buried before death, and killed by slow starvation.\r\n\r\n     \"'The triumphs of the Faith are not above-ground in our splendid\r\n     churches,' said the friar, looking round upon us, as we stopped to\r\n     rest in one of the low passages, with bones and dust surrounding us\r\n     on every side. 'They are here! among the martyrs' graves!' He was a\r\n     gentle, earnest man, and said it from his heart; but when I thought\r\n     how Christian men have dealt with one another; how, perverting our\r\n     most merciful religion, they have hunted down and tortured, burnt\r\n     and beheaded, strangled, slaughtered, and oppressed each other; I\r\n     pictured to myself an agony surpassing any that this Dust had\r\n     suffered with the breath of life yet lingering in it, and how these\r\n     great and constant hearts would have been shaken--how they would\r\n     have quailed and drooped--if a foreknowledge of the deeds that\r\n     professing Christians would commit in the great name for which they\r\n     died, could have rent them with its own unutterable anguish, on the\r\n     cruel wheel, and bitter cross, and in the fearful\r\n     fire.\"--_Dickens._\r\n\r\n     \"Countless martyrs, they say, rest in these ancient sepulchres. In\r\n     these dark depths the ancient Church took refuge from persecution;\r\n     there she laid her martyrs, and there, over their tombs, she\r\n     chaunted hymns of triumph, and held communion with Him for whom\r\n     they died. In that church I spend hours. I have no wish to descend\r\n     into those sacred sepulchres, and pry among the graves the\r\n     resurrection trump will open soon enough. I like to think of the\r\n     holy dead, lying undisturbed and quiet there; of their spirits in\r\n     Paradise; of their faith triumphant in the city that massacred\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     \"No doubt they also had their perplexities, and wondered why the\r\n     wicked triumph, and sighed to God, 'How long, O Lord, how\r\n     long?'\"--_Schonberg Cotta Family._\r\n\r\n     \"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the\r\n     souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the\r\n     testimony which they held: and they cried with a loud voice,\r\n     saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and\r\n     avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? And white robes\r\n     were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that\r\n     they should rest yet for a little season, until their\r\n     fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as\r\n     they were, should be fulfilled.\"--_Rev._ vi. 9--11.\r\n\r\nIn the valley beneath S. Sebastiano are the ruins of the _Circus of\r\nMaxentius_, near those of a villa of that emperor. The circus was 1482\r\nfeet long, 244 feet broad, and was capable of containing 15,000\r\nspectators, yet it is a miniature compared with the Circus Maximus,\r\nthough very interesting as retaining in tolerable preservation all the\r\ndifferent parts which composed a circus. The circular ruin near it was a\r\n_Temple_ dedicated by Maxentius to his son Romulus.\r\n\r\n     \"Le jeune Romulus, étant mort, fut placé au rang des dieux, dans\r\n     cet olympe qui s'écroulait. Son père lui éleva un temple dont la\r\n     partie inférieure se voit encore, et le cirque lui-même fut\r\n     peut-être une dépendance de ce temple funèbre, car les courses de\r\n     chars étaient un des honneurs que l'antiquité rendait aux morts, et\r\n     sont souvent pour cela représentées sur les tombeaux.\"--_Ampère,\r\n     Emp._ ii. 360.\r\n\r\nThese ruins are very picturesque, backed by the peaks of the Sabine\r\nrange, which in winter are generally covered with snow.\r\n\r\nThe opposite hill is crowned by the _Tomb of Cecilia Metella_, daughter\r\nof Quintus Metellus Creticus, and wife of Crassus. It is a round tower,\r\nseventy feet in diameter. The bulls' heads on the frieze gave it the\r\npopular name of Capo di Bove. The marble coating of the basement was\r\ncarried off by Urban VIII. to make the fountain of Trevi. The\r\nbattlements were added when the tomb was turned into a fortress by the\r\nCaëtani in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n     \"About two miles, or more, from the city gates, and right upon the\r\n     roadside, is an immense round pile, sepulchral in its original\r\n     purpose, like those already mentioned. It is built of great blocks\r\n     of hewn stone, on a vast, square foundation of rough, agglomerated\r\n     material, such as composes the mass of all the other ruinous tombs.\r\n     But, whatever might be the cause, it is in a far better state of\r\n     preservation than they. On its broad summit rise the battlements of\r\n     a mediæval fortress, out of the midst of which (so long since had\r\n     time begun to crumble the supplemental structure, and cover it with\r\n     soil, by means of wayside dust) grow trees, bushes, and thick\r\n     festoons of ivy. This tomb of a woman has become the dungeon-keep\r\n     of a castle; and all the care that Cecilia Metella's husband could\r\n     bestow, to secure endless peace for her beloved relics, only\r\n     sufficed to make that handful of precious ashes the nucleus of\r\n     battles, long ages after her death.\"--_Hawthorne, Transformation._\r\n\r\n    \"There is a stern round tower of other days,\r\n    Firm as a fortress, with its fence of stone,\r\n    Such as an army's baffled strength delays,\r\n    Standing with half its battlements alone,\r\n    And with two thousand years of ivy grown,\r\n    The garland of eternity, where wave\r\n    The green leaves over all by time o'erthrown;--\r\n    What was this tower of strength? within its cave\r\n    What treasure lay so lock'd, so hid?--a woman's grave.\r\n\r\n    \"But who was she, the lady of the dead,\r\n    Tomb'd in a palace? Was she chaste and fair?\r\n    Worthy a king's--or more--a Roman's bed?\r\n    What race of chiefs and heroes did she bear?\r\n    What daughter of her beauties was the heir?\r\n    How lived--how loved--how died she? Was she not\r\n    So honoured--and conspicuously there,\r\n    Where meaner relics must not dare to rot,\r\n    Placed to commemorate a more than mortal lot?\r\n\r\n    \"Perchance she died in youth: it may be, bow'd\r\n    With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb\r\n    That weigh'd upon her gentle dust, a cloud\r\n    Might gather o'er her beauty, and a gloom\r\n    In her dark eye, prophetic of the doom\r\n    Heaven gives its favourites--early death; yet shed\r\n    A sunset charm around her, and illume\r\n    With hectic light, the Hesperus of the dead,\r\n    Of her consuming cheek the autumnal leaf-like red.\r\n\r\n    \"Perchance she died in age--surviving all,\r\n    Charms, kindred, children--with the silver grey\r\n    On her long tresses, which might yet recall,\r\n    It may be, still a something of the day\r\n    When they were braided, and her proud array\r\n    And lovely form were envied, praised, and eyed\r\n    By Rome--but whither would Conjecture stray?\r\n    Thus much alone we know--Metella died,\r\n    The wealthiest Roman's wife: Behold his love or pride!\"\r\n\r\n    _Childe Harold._\r\n\r\nClose to the tomb are the ruins of a Gothic church of the Caëtani.\r\n\r\n     \"Le tombeau de Cecilia-Metella était devenu un château fort alors\r\n     aux mains des Caëtani, et autour du château s'était formé un\r\n     village avec son église, dont on a récemment retrouvé les\r\n     restes.\"--_Ampère, Voyage Dantesque._\r\n\r\nIt is at Cecilia Metella's tomb that the beauties of the Via Appia\r\nreally begin. A very short distance further, we emerge from the walls\r\nwhich have hitherto shut in the road on either side, and enjoy\r\nuninterrupted views over the Latin plain, strewn with its ruined castles\r\nand villages--and the long lines of aqueducts, to the Sabine and Alban\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n     \"The Via Appia is a magnificent promenade, amongst ruinous tombs,\r\n     the massive remains of which extend for many miles over the Roman\r\n     Campagna. The powerful families of ancient Rome loved to build\r\n     monuments to their dead by the side of the public road, probably to\r\n     exhibit at once their affection for their relations and their own\r\n     power and affluence. Most of these monuments are now nothing but\r\n     heaps of ruins, upon which are placed the statues and sculptures\r\n     which have been found in the earth or amongst the rubbish. Those\r\n     inscriptions which have been found on the Via Appia bear witness to\r\n     the grief of the living for the dead, but never to the hope of\r\n     reunion. On a great number of sarcophagi or the friezes of tombs\r\n     may be seen the dead sitting or lying as if they were alive, some\r\n     seem to be praying. Many heads have great individuality of\r\n     character. Sometimes a white marble figure, beautifully draped,\r\n     projects from these heaps of ruins, but without head or hands;\r\n     sometimes a hand is stretched out, or a portion of a figure rises\r\n     from the tomb. It is a street through monuments of the dead, across\r\n     an immense churchyard; for the desolate Roman Campagna may be\r\n     regarded as such. To the left it is scattered with the ruins of\r\n     colossal aqueducts, which, during the time of the emperors,\r\n     conveyed lakes and rivers to Rome, and which still, ruinous and\r\n     destroyed, delight the eye by the beautiful proportions of their\r\n     arcades. To the right is an immense prairie, without any other\r\n     limit than that of the ocean, which, however, is not seen from it.\r\n     The country is desolate, and only here and there are there any huts\r\n     or trees to be seen.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\n     \"For the space of a mile or two beyond the gate of S. Sebastiano,\r\n     this ancient and famous road is as desolate and disagreeable as\r\n     most of the other Roman avenues. It extends over small,\r\n     uncomfortable paving-stones, between brick and plastered walls,\r\n     which are very solidly constructed, and so high as almost to\r\n     exclude a view of the surrounding country. The houses are of the\r\n     most uninviting aspect, neither picturesque, nor homelike and\r\n     social; they have seldom or never a door opening on the wayside,\r\n     but are accessible only from the rear, and frown inhospitably upon\r\n     the traveller through iron-grated windows. Here and there appears a\r\n     dreary inn, or a wine-shop, designated by the withered bush beside\r\n     the entrance, within which you discover a stone-built and\r\n     sepulchral interior, where guests refresh themselves with sour\r\n     bread and goat's-milk cheese, washed down with wine of dolorous\r\n     acerbity.\r\n\r\n     \"At frequent intervals along the roadside, up rises the ruin of an\r\n     ancient tomb. As they stand now, these structures are immensely\r\n     high, and broken mounds of conglomerated brick, stone, pebbles, and\r\n     earth, all molten by time into a mass as solid and indestructible\r\n     as if each tomb were composed of a single boulder of granite. When\r\n     first erected, they were cased externally, no doubt, with slabs of\r\n     polished marble, artfully wrought, bas-reliefs, and all such\r\n     suitable adornments, and were rendered majestically beautiful by\r\n     grand architectural designs. This antique splendour has long since\r\n     been stolen from the dead, to decorate the palaces and churches of\r\n     the living. Nothing remains to the dishonoured sepulchres, except\r\n     their massiveness.\r\n\r\n     \"Even the pyramids form hardly a stranger spectacle, or a more\r\n     alien from human sympathies, than the tombs of the Appian Way, with\r\n     their gigantic height, breadth, and solidity, defying time and the\r\n     elements, and far too mighty to be demolished by an ordinary\r\n     earthquake. Here you may see a modern dwelling, and a garden with\r\n     its vines and olive-trees, perched on the lofty dilapidation of a\r\n     tomb, which forms a precipice of fifty feet in depth on each of the\r\n     four sides. There is a house on that funeral mound, where\r\n     generations of children have been born, and successive lives have\r\n     been spent, undisturbed by the ghost of the stern Roman whose ashes\r\n     were so preposterously burdened. Other sepulchres wear a crown of\r\n     grass, shrubbery, and forest-trees, which throw out a broad sweep\r\n     of branches, having had time, twice over, to be a thousand years\r\n     of age. On one of them stands a tower, which, though immemorially\r\n     more modern than the tomb, was itself built by immemorial hands,\r\n     and is now rifted quite from top to bottom by a vast fissure of\r\n     decay; the tomb-hillock, its foundation, being still as firm as\r\n     ever, and likely to endure until the last trump shall rend it wide\r\n     asunder, and summon forth its unknown dead.\r\n\r\n     \"Yes, its unknown dead! For, except in one or two doubtful\r\n     instances, these mountainous sepulchral edifices have not availed\r\n     to keep so much as the bare name of an individual or a family from\r\n     oblivion. Ambitious of everlasting remembrance as they were, the\r\n     slumberers might just as well have gone quietly to rest, each in\r\n     his pigeon-hole of a columbarium, or under his little green\r\n     hillock, in a grave-yard, without a headstone to mark the spot. It\r\n     is rather satisfactory than otherwise, to think that all these idle\r\n     pains have turned out so utterly abortive.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\nNear the fourth milestone, is the tomb of Marcus Servilius Quartus (with\r\nan inscription), restored by Canova in 1808. A bas-relief of the death\r\nof Atys, killed by Adrastus, a short distance beyond this, has been\r\nsuggested as part of the tomb of Seneca, who was put to death \"near the\r\nfourth milestone\" by order of Nero. An inscribed tomb beyond this is\r\nthat of Sextus Pompeius Justus.\r\n\r\nNear this, in the Campagna on the left, are some small remains, supposed\r\nto be those of a Temple of Juno.\r\n\r\nBeyond this a number of tombs can be identified, but none of any\r\nimportance. Such are the tombs of Plinius Eutychius, erected by Plinius\r\nZosimus, a freedman of Pliny the younger; of Caius Licinius; the Doric\r\ntomb of the tax-gatherer Claudius Philippanus, inscribed \"Tito. Claudio.\r\nSecundo. Philippiano. Coactori. Flavia. Irene. Vxori Indulgentissimo;\"\r\nof Rabinius, with three busts in relief; of Hermodorus; of Elsia Prima,\r\npriestess of Isis; of Marcus C. Cerdonus, with the bas-relief of an\r\nelephant bearing a burning altar.\r\n\r\nBeyond the fifth milestone, two circular mounds with basements of\r\npeperino, were considered by Canina to be the tombs of the Horatii and\r\nCuriatii.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the road is the exceedingly picturesque mediæval\r\nfortress, known as _Torre Mezza Strada_, into which are incorporated the\r\nremains of the Church of Sta. Maria Nuova, or della Gloria. Behind this\r\nextend a vast assemblage of ruins, which form a splendid foreground to\r\nthe distant mountain view, and whose size has led to their receiving the\r\npopular epithet of _Roma Vecchia_. Here was the favourite villa of the\r\nEmperor Commodus, where he was residing, when the people, excited by a\r\nsudden impulse during the games of the Circus, rose and poured out of\r\nRome against him--as the inhabitants of Paris to Versailles--and refused\r\nto depart, till, terrified into action by the entreaties of his\r\nconcubine Marcia, he tossed the head of the unpopular Cleander to them\r\nout of the window, and had the brains of that minister's child dashed\r\nout against the stones. This villa is proved by the discovery of a\r\nnumber of pipes bearing their names to have been that of the brothers\r\nCondianus and Maximus, of the great family of the Quintilii, which was\r\nconfiscated by Commodus.\r\n\r\n     \"L'histoire des deux frères est intéressante et romanesque.\r\n     Condianus et Maximus Quintilius étaient distingués par la science,\r\n     les talents militaires, la richesse, et surtout par une tendresse\r\n     mutuelle qui ne s'était jamais démentie. Servant toujours ensemble,\r\n     l'un se faisait le lieutenant de l'autre. Bien qu'étrangers à toute\r\n     conspiration, leur vertu les fit soupçonner d'être peu favorables à\r\n     Commode; ils furent proscrits et moururent ensemble comme ils\r\n     avaient vécu. L'un d'eux avait un fils nommé Sextus. Au moment de\r\n     la mort de son père et de son oncle, ce fils se trouvait en Syrie.\r\n     Pensant bien que le même sort l'attendait, il feignit de mourir\r\n     pour sauver sa vie. Sextus, après avoir bu sang du lièvre, monta à\r\n     cheval, se laissa tomber, vomit le sang qu'il avait pris et qui\r\n     parut être son propre sang. On mit dans sa bière le corps d'un\r\n     bélier qui passa pour son cadavre, et il disparut. Depuis ce temps,\r\n     il erra sons divers déguisements; mais on sut qu'il avait échappé,\r\n     et on se mit à sa recherche. Beaucoup furent tués parce-qu'ils lui\r\n     ressemblaient ou parce-qu'ils étaient soupçonnés de lui avoir donné\r\n     asile. Il n'est pas bien sûr qu'il ait été atteint, que sa tête se\r\n     trouvât parmi celles qu'on apporta à Rome et qu'on dit être la\r\n     sienne. Ce qui est certain, c'est qu'après la mort de Commode, un\r\n     aventurier, tenté par la belle villa et par les grandes richesses\r\n     des Quintilii, se donna pour Sextus et réclama son héritage. Il\r\n     paraît ne pas avoir manqué d'adresse et avoir connu celui pour\r\n     lequel il voulut qu'on le prît, car par ses réponses il se tira\r\n     très-bien de toutes les enquêtes. Peut-être s'était-il lié avec\r\n     Sextus et l'avait-il assassiné ensuite. Cependant l'empereur\r\n     Pertinax, successeur de Commode, l'ayant fait venir, eut l'idée de\r\n     lui parler grec. Le vrai Sextus connaissait parfaitement cette\r\n     langue. Le faux Sextus, qui ne savait pas le grec, répondit tout de\r\n     travers, et sa fraude fut ainsi découverte.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii.\r\n     253.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the Via Appia, appears a huge monument, on a narrow base,\r\ncalled the Tomb of the Metelli. Beyond this, after the fifth milestone,\r\nare the tombs of Sergius Demetrius, a wine merchant; of Lucius Arrius;\r\nof Septimia Gallia; and of one of the Cæcilii, in whose sepulchre,\r\naccording to Eutropius, was buried Pomponius Atticus, the friend of\r\nCicero, whose daughter Vipsania was the first wife of Agrippa, and whose\r\ngranddaughter Vipsania Agrippina was the first wife of Tiberius.\r\n\r\nClose to the sixth milestone is the mass of masonry sometimes called\r\n\"Casale Rotondo,\" or \"Cotta's Tomb,\" from that name being found there\r\ninscribed on a stone, but generally attributed to Messala Corvinus, the\r\npoet, and friend of Horace, and believed to have been raised to him by\r\nhis son Valerius Maximus Cotta, mentioned in Ovid.\r\n\r\n    \"Te autem in turba non ausim, Cotta, silere,\r\n    Pieridum lumen, præsidiumque fori.\"\r\n\r\n    _Epist._ xvi.\r\n\r\nThis tomb was even larger than that of Cecilia Metella, and was turned\r\ninto a fortress by the Orsini in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nBeyond this are tombs identified as those of P. Quintius, tribune of the\r\nsixteenth legion; Marcus Julius, steward of Claudius; Publius Decumius\r\nPhilomusus (with appropriate bas-reliefs of two mice nibbling a cake);\r\nand of Cedritius Flaccianius.\r\n\r\nPassing on the left the _Tor di Selce_, erected upon a huge unknown\r\ntomb, are the tombs of Titia Eucharis, and of Atilius Evodus, jeweller\r\n(margaritarius) on the Via Sacra, with the inscription, \"Hospes\r\nresiste--aspice ubi continentur ossa hominis boni misericordis amantis\r\npauperis.\" Near the eighth milestone are ruins attributed to the temples\r\nof Silvanus and of Hercules,--of which the latter is mentioned in\r\nMartial's Epigrams, beyond which were the villas of Bassus and of\r\nPersius. The last tomb identified is that of Quintus Verranius. Near the\r\nninth milestone is a tomb supposed to be that of Gallienus (Imp. 268),\r\nwho lived close by in a villa, amid the ruins of which \"the Discobolus\"\r\nwas discovered.\r\n\r\nFrom the stream called Pontecello, near the tenth milestone, the road\r\ngradually ascends to Albano, passing several large but unnamed tombs. At\r\nthe Osteria delle Frattocchie it joins the Via Appia Nuova. Close to the\r\ngate of Albano, it passes on the left the tall tomb attributed to Pompey\r\nthe Great, in accordance with the statement of Plutarch, and in spite of\r\nthe epigram of Varro Atacinus, which says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Marmoreo Licinius tumulo jacet; at Cato parvo;\r\n    Pompeius nullo: quis putet esse Deus.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many processions which have passed along this road, perhaps\r\nthe most remarkable have been that bearing back to Rome the dead body of\r\nSylla, who died at Pozzuoli, \"in a gilt litter, with royal ornaments,\r\ntrumpets before him, and horsemen behind;\"[223] and the funeral of\r\nAugustus, who dying at Nola (A.D. 14), was brought to Bovillæ, and\r\nremained there a month in the sanctuary of the Julian family, after\r\nwhich the knights brought the body in solemn procession to his palace on\r\nthe Palatine.\r\n\r\nBut throughout a walk along the Appian Way, the one great Christian\r\ninterest of this world-famous road, will, to the Christian visitor,\r\noverpower all others.\r\n\r\n     \"And so we went toward Rome.\r\n\r\n     \"And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet\r\n     us as far as Appii-forum, and the Three Taverns: whom when Paul\r\n     saw, he thanked God, and took courage.\r\n\r\n     \"And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to\r\n     the captain of the guard; but Paul was suffered to dwell by\r\n     himself, with a soldier that kept him.\"--_Acts_ xxviii. 14--16.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not without its manifold uses to remember that, amidst the\r\n     dim and wavering traditions of later times, one figure at least\r\n     stands out clear and distinct and undoubted, and this figure is the\r\n     Apostle Paul. He, whatever we may think concerning any other\r\n     apostle or apostolic man in connection with Rome, he, beyond a\r\n     shadow of doubt, appears in the New Testament as her great teacher.\r\n     No criticism or scepticism of modern times has ever questioned the\r\n     perfect authenticity of that last chapter of the Acts, which gives\r\n     the account of his journey, stage by stage, till he set foot within\r\n     the walls of the city. However much we may be compelled to distrust\r\n     any particular traditions concerning special localities of his life\r\n     and death, we cannot doubt for a moment that his eye rested on the\r\n     same general view of sky and plain and mountain; that his feet trod\r\n     the pavement of the same Appian road; that his way lay through the\r\n     same long avenue of ancient tombs on which we now look and wonder;\r\n     that he entered (and there we have our last authentic glimpse of\r\n     his progress) through the arch of Drusus, and then is lost to our\r\n     view in the great Babylon of Rome.\"--_A. P. Stanley's Sermons._\r\n\r\n     \"When St. Paul was approaching Rome, all the bases of the mountains\r\n     were (as indeed they are partially now) clustered round with the\r\n     villas and gardens of wealthy citizens. The Appian Way climbs and\r\n     then descends along its southern slope. After passing Lanuvium it\r\n     crossed a crater-like valley or immense substructions, which still\r\n     remain. Here is Aricia, an easy stage from Rome. The town was above\r\n     the road, and on the hillside swarms of beggars beset travellers as\r\n     they passed. On the summit of the next rise, Paul of Tarsus would\r\n     obtain his first view of Rome. There is no doubt that the prospect\r\n     was, in many respects, very different from the view which is now\r\n     obtained from the same spot. It is true that the natural features\r\n     of the scene are unaltered. The long wall of blue Sabine mountains,\r\n     with Soracte in the distance, closed in the Campagna, which\r\n     stretched far across to the sea and round the base of the Alban\r\n     hills. But ancient Rome was not, like modern Rome, impressive from\r\n     its solitude, standing alone, with its one conspicuous cupola, in\r\n     the midst of a desolate though beautiful waste. St. Paul would see\r\n     a vast city, covering the Campagna, and almost continuously\r\n     connected by its suburbs with the villas on the hill where he\r\n     stood, and with the bright towns which clustered on the sides of\r\n     the mountains opposite. Over all the intermediate space were the\r\n     houses and gardens, through which aqueducts and roads might be\r\n     traced in converging lines towards the confused mass of edifices\r\n     which formed the city of Rome. Here no conspicuous building,\r\n     elevated above the rest, attracted the eye or the imagination.\r\n     Ancient Rome had neither cupola nor campanile, still less had it\r\n     any of those spires which give life to all the capitals of northern\r\n     Christendom. It was a widespread aggregate of buildings, which,\r\n     though separated by narrow streets and open spaces, appeared, when\r\n     seen from near Aricia, blended into one indiscriminate mass: for\r\n     distance concealed the contrasts which divided the crowded\r\n     habitations of the poor and the dark haunts of filth and\r\n     misery--from the theatres and colonnades, the baths, the temples,\r\n     and palaces with gilded roofs, flashing back the sun.\r\n\r\n     \"The road descended into the plain at Bovillæ, six miles from\r\n     Aricia: and thence it proceeded in a straight line, with the\r\n     sepulchres of illustrious families on either hand. One of these was\r\n     the burial-place of the Julian gens, with which the centurion who\r\n     had charge of the prisoners was in some way connected. As they\r\n     proceeded over the old pavement, among gardens and modern houses,\r\n     and approached nearer the busy metropolis--the 'conflux issuing\r\n     forth or entering in' in various costumes and on various\r\n     errands,--vehicles, horsemen, and foot-passengers, soldiers and\r\n     labourers, Romans and foreigners,--became more crowded and\r\n     confusing. The houses grew closer. They were already in Rome. It\r\n     was impossible to define the commencement of the city. Its populous\r\n     portions extended far beyond the limits marked out by Servius. The\r\n     ancient wall, with its once sacred pomœrium, was rather an\r\n     object for antiquarian interest, like the walls of York or Chester,\r\n     than any protection against the enemies, who were kept far aloof by\r\n     the legions on the frontier.\r\n\r\n     \"Yet the Porta Capena is a spot which we can hardly leave without\r\n     lingering for a moment. Under this arch--which was perpetually\r\n     dripping with the water of the aqueduct that went over it--had\r\n     passed all those who, since a remote period of the republic, had\r\n     travelled by the Appian Way,--victorious generals with their\r\n     legions, returning from foreign service,--emperors and courtiers,\r\n     vagrant representatives of every form of heathenism, Greeks and\r\n     Asiatics, Jews and Christians. From this point entering within the\r\n     city, Julius and his prisoners moved on, with the Aventine on their\r\n     left, close round the base of the Cœlian, and through the hollow\r\n     ground which lay between this hill and the Palatine: thence over\r\n     the low ridge called Velia, where afterwards was built the arch of\r\n     Titus, to commemorate the destruction of Jerusalem; and then\r\n     descending, by the _Via Sacra_, into that space which was the\r\n     centre of imperial power and imperial magnificence, and associated\r\n     also with the most glorious recollections of the republic. The\r\n     Forum was to Rome, what the Acropolis was to Athens, the heart of\r\n     all the characteristic interest of the place. Here was the\r\n     _Milliarium Aureum_, to which the roads of all the provinces\r\n     converged. All around were the stately buildings, which were raised\r\n     in the closing years of the republic, and by the earlier emperors.\r\n     In front was the Capitoline Hill, illustrious long before the\r\n     invasion of the Gauls. Close on the left, covering that hill, whose\r\n     name is associated in every modern European language with the\r\n     notion of imperial splendour, were the vast ranges of the\r\n     _palace_--the 'house of Cæsar' (Philipp. iv. 22). Here were the\r\n     household troops quartered in a _prætorium_ attached to the palace.\r\n     And here (unless, indeed, it was in the great Prætorian Camp\r\n     outside the city wall) Julius gave up his prisoner to Burrus, the\r\n     Prætorian Prefect, whose official duty it was to keep in custody\r\n     all accused persons who were to be tried before the\r\n     Emperor.\"--_Conybeare and Howson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE QUIRINAL AND VIMINAL.\r\n\r\n     Palazzo Barberini--Palazzo Albani--S. Carlo a Quattro Fontane--S.\r\n     Andrea a Monte Cavallo--Quirinal Palace--Palazzo della\r\n     Consulta--Palazzo Rospigliosi--Colonna Gardens and Temple of the\r\n     Sun--S.

Paolo Primo Eremita--S.\r\n     Dionisio--S. Vitale.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine the exact limits of what in ancient times\r\nwere regarded as the Quirinal and Viminal hills. They, like the\r\nEsquiline and Cœlian, are \"in fact merely spurs or tongues of hill,\r\nprojecting inwards from a common base, the broad table-land, which\r\nslopes on the other side almost imperceptibly into the Campagna.\"[224]\r\nThat, which is described in this chapter as belonging to these two\r\nhills, is chiefly the district to the right of the Via Quattro Fontane,\r\nand its continuations--which extend in a straight line to Sta. Maria\r\nMaggiore.\r\n\r\nThe Quirinal, like all the other hills, except the Palatine and the\r\nCœlian, belonged to the Sabines in the early period of Roman history,\r\nand is full of records of their occupation. They had a Capitol here\r\nwhich is believed to have been long anterior to that on the Capitoline,\r\nand which was crowned by a temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. This\r\nSabine capitol occupied the site of the present Palazzo Rospigliosi.\r\n\r\nThe name Quirinal is derived from the Sabine word _Quiris_--signifying a\r\nlance, which gave the Sabines their name of Quirites, or lance-bearers,\r\nand to their god the name Quirinus.[225] After his death Romulus\r\nreceived this title, and an important temple was raised to him on the\r\nQuirinal by Numa,[226] under this name, thus identifying him with Janus\r\nQuirinus, the national god. This temple was surrounded by a sacred grove\r\nmentioned by Ovid.[227] It was rebuilt by the consul L. Papirius Cursor,\r\nto commemorate his triumph after the third Samnite war, B.C. 293, when\r\nhe adorned it with a sun-dial (_solarium horologium_), the first set up\r\nin Rome, which, however, not being constructed for the right latitude,\r\ndid not show the time correctly. This defect was not remedied till\r\nnearly a century afterwards, when Q. Marcius Philippus set up a correct\r\ndial.[228] In front of this temple grew two celebrated myrtle-trees, one\r\ncalled _Patricia_, the other _Plebeia_, which shared the fortunes of\r\ntheir respective orders, as the orange-tree at Sta. Sabina now does that\r\nof the Dominicans. Thus, up to the fifth century, Patricia flourished\r\ngloriously, and Plebeia pined; but from the time when the plebeians\r\ncompletely gained the upper hand, Patricia withered away.[229] The\r\ntemple was rebuilt by Augustus, and Dion Cassius states that the number\r\nof pillars by which it was surrounded accorded with that of the years of\r\nhis life.[230]\r\n\r\nAdjoining the temple was a portico:\r\n\r\n    \"Vicini pete porticum Quirini:\r\n    Turbam non habet otiosiorem\r\n    Pompeius.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, xi. Ep. i.\r\n\r\n                     ----\"Officium cras\r\n    Primo sole mihi peragendum in valle Quirini.\"\r\n\r\n    _Juvenal, Sat._ ii. 132.\r\n\r\nHard by was a temple of Fortuna Publica,\r\n\r\n    \"Qui dicet, Quondam sacrata est colle Quirini\r\n    Hac Fortuna die Publica; verus erit.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ iv. 375.\r\n\r\nalso an altar to Mamurius, an ancient Sabine divinity, probably\r\nidentical with Mars, and a temple of Salus, or Health, which gave a name\r\nto the Porta Salutaria, which must have stood nearly on the site of the\r\npresent Quattro Fontane, and near which, not inappropriately, was a\r\ntemple of Fever, in the Via S. Vitale, where fever is still prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe site of the temple of Quirinus is ascertained to have been nearly\r\nthat now occupied by S. Andrea a Monte Cavallo. On the opposite side of\r\nthe street, where part of the papal palace now stands, was the temple of\r\nSemo-Sanctus, the reputed father of Sabinus. Between these two temples\r\nwas the House of Pomponius Atticus (the friend and correspondent of\r\nCicero), a situation which gave an opportunity for the witticism of\r\nCicero when he said that Caesar would rather dwell with Quirinus than\r\nwith Salus, meaning that he would rather be at war than be in good\r\nhealth.[231]\r\n\r\nIn the same neighbourhood lived Martial the epigrammatist, \"on the\r\nthird floor, in a narrow street,\" whence he had a view as far as the\r\nportico of Agrippa, near the Flaminian Way. Below, probably on the site\r\nnow occupied by the Piazza Barberini, was a Circus of Flora.\r\n\r\n    \"Mater, ades, florum, ludis celebranda jocosis:\r\n      Distuleram partes mense priore tuas.\r\n    Incipis Aprili: transis in tempora Maii.\r\n      Alter te, fugiens; cum venit, alter habet.\r\n    Quum tua sint cedantque tibi confinia mensum,\r\n      Convenit in laudes ille vel ille tuas.\r\n    Circus in hunc exit, clamataque palma theatris:\r\n      Hoc quoque cum Circi munere carmen eat.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ v. 183.\r\n\r\nAmong the great families who lived on the Quirinal were the Cornelii,\r\nwho had a street of their own, _Vicus Corneliorum_, probably on the\r\nslopes behind the present Colonna Palace; and the Flavii, who were of\r\nSabine origin.[232] Domitian was born here in the house of the Flavii,\r\nafterwards consecrated by him as a temple, in which Vespasian, Titus,\r\nand Domitian himself were buried, and Julia the ugly daughter of\r\nTitus--well known from her statues in the Vatican.\r\n\r\nAs some fragments remain of the two buildings erected on the Quirinal\r\nduring the later empire, Aurelian's Temple of the Sun, and the Baths of\r\nConstantine, they will be noticed in the regular course.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the ascent of the hill, just above the Piazza del Tritone, is the\r\nnoble _Barberini Palace_, built by Urban VIII. from designs of Carlo\r\nMaderno, continued by Borromini, and finished by Bernini, in 1640. It is\r\nscreened from the street by a magnificent railing between columns,\r\nerected 1865--67, and if this railing could be continued, and the block\r\nof houses towards the piazza removed, it would be far the most splendid\r\nprivate palace in Rome.\r\n\r\nThis immense building is a memorial of the magnificence and ambition of\r\nUrban VIII. Its size is enormous, the smallest apartment in the palace\r\ncontaining forty rooms. The Prince at present inhabits the right wing;\r\nwith him lives his elder brother the Duke, who abdicated the family\r\nhonours in his favour. In the left wing--occupied in the beginning of\r\nthis century by the ex-king (Charles VII.) and queen of Spain, and the\r\n\"Prince of Peace\"--is the huge apartment of the late Cardinal Barberini,\r\nnow uninhabited. On this side is the grand staircase, upon which is\r\nplaced a lion in high relief, found on the family property at\r\nPalestrina. It is before this lion that Canova is said to have lain for\r\nhours upon the pavement, studying for his tomb of Clement XIII. in St.\r\nPeter's. The _guarda-roba_, badly kept, contains many curious relics of\r\nfamily grandeur; amongst them is a sedan-chair, painted by Titian.\r\n\r\nThe _Library_ (open on Thursdays from nine to two) contains a most\r\nvaluable collection of MSS., about 7000 in number, brought together by\r\nCardinal Francesco Barberini, nephew of Urban VIII. They include\r\ncollections of letters of Galileo, Bembo, and Bellarmine; the official\r\nreports to Urban VIII., relating to the state of Catholicism in England\r\nin the time of Charles I.; a copy of the Bible in the Samaritan\r\ncharacter; a Bible of the fourth century; several MSS. copies of Dante;\r\na missal illuminated by Ghirlandajo; and a book of sketches of ancient\r\nRoman edifices, of 1465, by Giuliano de Sangallo,--most interesting to\r\nthe antiquarian and architect, as preserving the forms of many public\r\nbuildings which have disappeared since that date. Among the 50,000\r\nprinted books is a Hebrew Bible of 1788, one of the twelve known copies\r\nof the complete edition of Soncino; a Latin Plato, by Ficino, with\r\nmarginal notes by Tasso and his father Bernardo; a Dante of 1477, with\r\nnotes by Bembo, &c.\r\n\r\nIn the right wing is a huge _Hall_ (adorned with second-rate statues),\r\nwith a grand ceiling by _Pietro da Cortona_ (1596--1669), representing\r\n\"Il Trionfo della Gloria,\" the Forge of Vulcan, Minerva annihilating the\r\nTitans, and other mythological subjects--much admired by Lanzi, and\r\nconsidered by Kugler to be the most important work of the artist. Four\r\nvast frescoes of the Fathers of the Church are preserved here, having\r\nbeen removed from the dome of St. Peter's, where they were replaced with\r\nmosaics by Urban VIII. Below are other frescoes by _Pietro da Cortona_,\r\na portrait of Urban VIII., and some tapestries illustrative of the\r\nevents of his reign and of his own intense self-esteem--thus the Virgin\r\nand Angels are represented bringing in the ornaments of the papacy at\r\nhis coronation, &c. But the conceit of Pope Urban reaches its climax in\r\na room at the top of the house, which exhibits a number of the Barberini\r\nbees (the family crest) flocking against the sun, and eclipsing it--to\r\ntypify the splendour of the family. The Will of Pope Urban VIII. is a\r\nvery curious document, providing against the extinction of the family in\r\nevery apparent contingency; this, however, now seems likely to take\r\nplace; the heir is a Sciarra. The pillars in front of the palace, and\r\nall the surrounding buildings, teem with the bees of the Barberini,\r\nwhich may also be seen on the Propaganda and many other great Roman\r\nedifices, and which are creeping up the robe of Urban VIII. in St.\r\nPeter's.\r\n\r\n     \"The Barberini were the last papal nephews who aspired to\r\n     independent principalities. Urban VIII., though he enriched them\r\n     enormously, appears to have been but little satisfied with them. He\r\n     used to complain that he had four relations who were fit for\r\n     nothing, the first, Cardinal Francesco, was a saint, and worked no\r\n     miracles: the second, Cardinal Antonio, was a monk, and had no\r\n     patience: the third, Cardinal Antonio the younger, was an orator\r\n     (_i.e._ an ambassador), and did not know how to speak: and the\r\n     fourth was a general, who could not draw a sword.\"--_Goethe,\r\n     Romische Briefe._\r\n\r\nOn the right, on entering the palace, is the small _Collection of\r\nPictures_ (open when the custode chooses to be there), indifferently\r\nlodged for a building so magnificent. We may notice:--\r\n\r\n     _2nd Room._--\r\n\r\n    34. Urban VIII.: _Andrea Sacchi_.\r\n    35. A Cardinal: _Titian_.\r\n    48. Madonna and Child, St. John, and St Jerome: _Francia_.\r\n    54.

Adam and Eve: _Domenichino_.\r\n\r\n     _3rd Room._--\r\n\r\n     73. The \"Schiava:\" _Palma Vecchio_.\r\n\r\n     \"The so-called Slave (a totally unmeaning name) is probably a mere\r\n     school picture, of grand beauty, but with too clumsy a style of\r\n     drapery, too cold an expression, and too brown a carnation for\r\n     Titian--to whom it is attributed.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     76. Castel Gandolfo: _Claude Lorraine_.\r\n\r\n     78. Portrait: _Bronzino_.\r\n\r\n     79.

The Fornarina (with the painter's name on the armlet):\r\n     _Raphael_.\r\n\r\n     \"The history of this person, to whom Raphael was attached even to\r\n     his death, is obscure, nor are we very clear with regard to her\r\n     likenesses. In the tribune at Florence there is a portrait,\r\n     inscribed with the date 1512, of a very beautiful woman holding the\r\n     fur trimming of her mantle with her right hand, which is said to\r\n     represent her. The picture is decidedly by Raphael, but can hardly\r\n     represent the Fornarina; at least it has no resemblance to this\r\n     portrait, which has the name of Raphael on the armlet, and of the\r\n     authenticity of which (particularly with respect to the subject)\r\n     there can hardly be a doubt. In this the figure is seated, and is\r\n     uncovered to the waist; she draws a light drapery around her; a\r\n     shawl is twisted round her head. The execution is beautiful and\r\n     delicate, although the lines are sufficiently defined; the forms\r\n     are fine and not without beauty, but at the same time not free from\r\n     an expression of coarseness and common life. The eyes are large,\r\n     dark, and full of fire, and seem to speak of brighter days. There\r\n     are repetitions of this picture, from the school of Raphael, in\r\n     Roman galleries.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n    86. Death of Germanicus: _Poussin._\r\n    88. Seaport: _Claude Lorraine._\r\n    90. Holy Family: _Andrea del Sarto._\r\n    93. Annunciation: _Botticelli._\r\n\r\nBut the interest of this collection centres entirely around two\r\nportraits--that (81) of Lucrezia, the unhappy wife of Francesco Cenci,\r\nby _Scipione Gaetani_, and that (85) of Beatrice Cenci, by _Guido Reni_.\r\n\r\n     \"The portrait of Beatrice Cenci is most interesting as a just\r\n     representation of one of the loveliest specimens of the workmanship\r\n     of nature. There is a fixed and pale composure upon the features;\r\n     she seems sad and stricken down in spirit, yet the despair thus\r\n     expressed is lightened by the patience of gentleness. Her head is\r\n     bound with folds of white drapery, from which the yellow strings of\r\n     her golden hair escape, and fall about her neck. The moulding of\r\n     her face is exquisitely delicate; the eyebrows are distinct and\r\n     arched; the lips have that permanent meaning of imagination and\r\n     sensibility which suffering has not repressed, and which it seems\r\n     as if death scarcely could extinguish. Her forehead is large and\r\n     clear; her eyes, which we are told were remarkable for their\r\n     vivacity, are swollen with weeping, and lustreless, but beautifully\r\n     tender and serene. In the whole mien there is a simplicity and\r\n     dignity, which, united with her exquisite loveliness and deep\r\n     sorrow, is inexpressibly pathetic. Beatrice Cenci appears to have\r\n     been one of those persons in whom energy and gentleness dwell\r\n     together without destroying one another; her nature simple and\r\n     profound. The crimes and miseries in which she was an actor and\r\n     sufferer, are as the mask and the mantle in which circumstances\r\n     clothed her for her impersonation on the scene of the\r\n     world.\"--_Shelley's Preface to the Cenci._\r\n\r\n     \"The picture of Beatrice Cenci represents simply a female head; a\r\n     very youthful, girlish, perfectly beautiful face, enveloped in\r\n     white drapery, from beneath which strays a lock or two of what\r\n     seems a rich, though hidden luxuriance of auburn hair. The eyes are\r\n     large and brown, and meet those of the spectator, evidently with a\r\n     strange, ineffectual effort to escape. There is a little redness\r\n     about the eyes, very slightly indicated, so that you would question\r\n     whether or no the girl had been weeping. The whole face is very\r\n     quiet; there is no distortion or disturbance of any single feature;\r\n     nor is it easy to see why the expression is not cheerful, or why a\r\n     single touch of the artist's pencil should not brighten it into\r\n     joyousness. But, in fact, it is the very saddest picture ever\r\n     painted or conceived; it involves an unfathomable depth of sorrow,\r\n     the sense of which comes to the observer by a sort of intuition. It\r\n     is a sorrow that removes this beautiful girl out of the sphere of\r\n     humanity, and sets her in a far-off region, the remoteness of\r\n     which, while yet her face is so close before us,--makes us shiver\r\n     as at a spectre. You feel all the time you look at Beatrice, as if\r\n     she were trying to escape from your gaze. She knows that her sorrow\r\n     is so strange and immense, that she ought to be solitary for ever\r\n     both for the world's sake and her own; and this is the reason we\r\n     feel such a distance between Beatrice and ourselves, even when our\r\n     eyes meet hers. It is infinitely heart-breaking to meet her glance,\r\n     and to know that nothing can be done to help or comfort her,\r\n     neither does she ask help or comfort, knowing the hopelessness of\r\n     her case better than we do. She is a fallen angel--fallen and yet\r\n     sinless: and it is only this depth of sorrow with its weight and\r\n     darkness, that keeps her down to earth, and brings her within our\r\n     view even while it sets her beyond our reach.\"--_Hawthorne,\r\n     Transformation._\r\n\r\n     \"The portrait of Beatrice Cenci is a picture almost impossible to\r\n     be forgotten. Through the transcendent sweetness and beauty of the\r\n     face, there is a something shining out that haunts me. I see it\r\n     now, as I see this paper, or my pen. The head is loosely draped in\r\n     white; the light hair falling down below the linen folds. She has\r\n     turned suddenly towards you; and there is an expression in the\r\n     eyes--although they are very tender and gentle--as if the wildness\r\n     of a momentary terror, or distraction, had been struggled with and\r\n     overcome, that instant; and nothing but a celestial hope, and a\r\n     beautiful sorrow, and a desolate earthly helplessness remained.\r\n     Some stories say that Guido painted it the night before her\r\n     execution; some other stories, that he painted it from memory,\r\n     after having seen her on her way to the scaffold. I am willing to\r\n     believe that, as you see her on his canvas, so she turned towards\r\n     him, in the crowd, from the first sight of the axe, and stamped\r\n     upon his mind a look which he has stamped on mine as though I had\r\n     stood beside him in the concourse. The guilty palace of the Cenci:\r\n     blighting a whole quarter of the town, as it stands withering away\r\n     by grains: had that face, to my fancy, in its dismal porch, and at\r\n     its black blind windows, and flitting up and down its dreary\r\n     stairs, and growing out of the darkness of its ghostly galleries.\r\n     The history is written in the painting; written, in the dying\r\n     girl's face, by Nature's own hand. And oh! how in that one touch\r\n     she puts to flight (instead of making kin) the puny world that\r\n     claims to be related to her, in right of poor conventional\r\n     forgeries!\"--_Dickens._\r\n\r\n     \"Five days had been passed by Beatrice in the secret prisons of the\r\n     Torre Savella, when, at an early hour in the morning, her advocate,\r\n     Farinacci, entered her sad abode. With him appeared a young man of\r\n     about twenty-five years of age, dressed in the fashion of a writer\r\n     in the courts of justice of that day. Unheeded by Beatrice, he sat\r\n     regarding her at a little distance with fixed attention. She had\r\n     risen from her miserable pallet, but, unlike the wretched inmate of\r\n     a dungeon, she seemed a being from a brighter sphere. Her eyes were\r\n     of liquid softness, her forehead large and clear, her countenance\r\n     of angelic purity, mysteriously beautiful. Around her head a fold\r\n     of white muslin had been carelessly wrapped, from whence in rich\r\n     luxuriance fell her fair and waving hair. Profound sorrow imparted\r\n     an air of touching sensibility to her lovely features. With all the\r\n     eagerness of hope, she begged Farinacci to tell her frankly if his\r\n     visit foreboded good, and assured him of her gratitude for the\r\n     anxiety he evinced, to save her life and that of her family.\r\n\r\n     \"Farinacci conversed with her for some time, while at a distance\r\n     sat his companion, sketching the features of Beatrice. Turning\r\n     round, she observed this with displeasure and surprise; Farinacci\r\n     explained that this seeming writer was the celebrated painter,\r\n     Guido Reni, who, earnestly desiring her picture, had entreated to\r\n     be introduced into the prison for the purpose of obtaining so rich\r\n     an acquisition. At first unwilling, but afterwards consenting, she\r\n     turned and said, 'Signor Guido, your renown might make me desirous\r\n     of knowing you, but how will you undervalue me in my present\r\n     situation. From the fatality that surrounds me, you will judge me\r\n     guilty. Perhaps my face will tell you I am not wicked; it will show\r\n     you, too, that I now languish in this prison, which I may quit,\r\n     only to ascend the scaffold. Your great name, and my sad story, may\r\n     make my portrait interesting, and,' she added, with touching\r\n     simplicity, 'the picture will awaken compassion if you write on one\r\n     of its angles the word, _innocente_.' The great artist set himself\r\n     to work, and produced the picture now in the Palazzo Barberini, a\r\n     picture that rivets the attention of every beholder, which, once\r\n     seen, ever after hovers over the memory with an interest the most\r\n     harrowing and mysterious.\"--_From \"Beatrice Cenci, Storia del\r\n     Secolo XVI., Raccontata dal D.A.A., Firenze.\" Whiteside's\r\n     Translation._\r\n\r\nThere is a pretty old-fashioned garden belonging to this palace, at one\r\ncorner of which--overhanging an old statue--was the celebrated\r\n_Barberini Pine_, often drawn by artists from the Via Sterrata at the\r\nback of the garden, where statue and pine combined well with the Church\r\nof S. Caio; but, alas, this magnificent tree was cut down in 1872.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the palace-court, behind the arched bridge leading to the\r\ngarden, is--let into the wall--an inscription which formed part of the\r\ndedication of an arch erected to Claudius by the senate and people, in\r\nhonour of the conquest of Britain. The letters were inlaid with bronze.\r\nIt was found near the Palazzo Sciarra, where the arch is supposed to\r\nhave stood.\r\n\r\nAscending to the summit of the hill, we find four ugly statues of\r\nriver-gods, lying over the _Quattro Fontane_, from which the street\r\ntakes its name.\r\n\r\nOn the left is the _Palazzo Albani_, recently restored by Queen\r\nChristina of Spain.\r\n\r\n     \"In one of its rooms is a very ancient painting of Jupiter and\r\n     Ganymede, in a very uncommon style, uniting considerable grandeur\r\n     of conception, great force and decision, and a deep tone and colour\r\n     which produce great effect. It is said to be Grecian.\"--_Eaton's\r\n     Rome._\r\n\r\nThe opposite church, _S. Carlo a Quattro Fontane_, is worth observing\r\nfrom the fact that the whole building, church and convent, corresponds\r\nwith one of the four piers supporting the cupola of St. Peter's. Here\r\nwas formed the point of attack against the Quirinal Palace, November 16,\r\n1848, which caused the flight of Pius IX., and the downfall of his\r\ngovernment. From a window of this convent the shot was fired which\r\nkilled Monsignor Palma, one of the pontifical secretaries, and a writer\r\non ecclesiastical history--who had unfortunately exposed himself at one\r\nof the windows opposite. The church contains two pictures by _Mignard_\r\nrelating to the history of S. Carlo.\r\n\r\nTurning down Via del Quirinale, on the left is _S. Andrea a Monte\r\nCavallo_ (on the supposed site of the temple of Quirinus), erected, as\r\nit is told by an inscription inside, by Camillo Pamphili, nephew of\r\nInnocent X., from designs of Bernini. It has a Corinthian façade and a\r\nprojecting semicircular portico with Ionic columns. The interior is\r\noval. It is exceedingly rich, being almost entirely lined with red\r\nmarble streaked with white (Sicilian jasper), divided by white marble\r\npillars supporting a gilt cupola. The high altar--supposed to cover the\r\nbody of St. Zeno--between really magnificent pillars, is surmounted by a\r\nfine picture, by _Borgognone_, of the crucifixion of St. Andrew. Near\r\nthis is the tomb, by _Festa_, of Emmanuel IV., king of Sardinia, who\r\nabdicated his throne in 1802, to become a Jesuit monk in the adjoining\r\nconvent, where he died in 1818. On the right is the chapel of Santa\r\nCroce, with three pictures of the passion and death of Christ by\r\n_Brandini_; and that of St. Francis Xavier, with three pictures by\r\n_Baciccio_, representing the saint preaching,--baptizing an Indian\r\nqueen,--and lying dead in the island of Sancian in China. On the left\r\nis the chapel of the Virgin, with pictures, by _David_, of the three\r\ngreat Jesuit saints--St. Ignatius Loyola, St. Francis Borgia, and St.\r\nLuigi Gonzaga--adoring the Virgin, and, by _Gerard de la Nuit_, of the\r\nAdoration of the Shepherds and of the Magi; and lastly the chapel of S.\r\nStanislas Kostka, containing his shrine of gold and lapis-lazuli, under\r\nan exceedingly rich altar, which is adorned with a beautiful picture by\r\n_Carlo Maratta_, representing the saint receiving the Infant Jesus from\r\nthe arms of his mother. At the sides of the chapel are two other\r\npictures by _Maratta_, one of which represents S. Stanislas \"bathing\r\nwith water his breast inflamed with divine love,\" the other his\r\nreceiving the host from the hands of an angel. These are the three\r\nprincipal incidents in the story of the young S. Stanislas, who belonged\r\nto a noble Polish family and abandoned the world to shut himself up\r\nhere, saying, \"I am not born for the good things of this world; that\r\nwhich my heart desires is the good things of eternity.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I have long ago exhausted all my capacity of admiration for\r\n     splendid interiors of churches; but methinks this little, little\r\n     temple (it is not more than fifty or sixty feet across) has a more\r\n     perfect and gem-like beauty than any other. Its shape is oval, with\r\n     an oval dome, and above that another little dome, both of which are\r\n     magnificently frescoed. Around the base of the larger dome is\r\n     wreathed a flight of angels, and the smaller and upper one is\r\n     encircled by a garland of cherubs--cherub and angel all of pure\r\n     white marble. The oval centre of the church is walled round with\r\n     precious and lustrous marble, of a red-veined variety, interspersed\r\n     with columns and pilasters of white; and there are arches, opening\r\n     through this rich wall, forming chapels, which the architect seems\r\n     to have striven hard to make even more gorgeous than the main body\r\n     of the church. The pavement is one star of various tinted\r\n     marble.\"--_Hawthorne, Notes on Italy._\r\n\r\nThe adjoining _Convent of the Noviciate of the Order of Jesus_ contains\r\nthe room in which S. Stanislas Kostka died, at the age of eighteen, with\r\nhis reclining statue by _Le Gros_, the body in white, his dress (that of\r\na novice) in black, and the couch upon which he lies in yellow marble.\r\nBehind his statue is a picture of a celestial vision which consoled him\r\nin his last moments. On the day of his death, November 13, the convent\r\nis thrown open, and mass is said without ceasing in this chamber, which\r\nis visited by thousands.\r\n\r\n     \"La petite chambre de S. Stanislas Kostka, est un de ces lieux où\r\n     la prière naît spontanément dans le cœur, et s'en échappe comme\r\n     par un cours naturel.\"--_Veuillot, Parfum de Rome._[233]\r\n\r\nIn the convent garden is shown the fountain where \"the angels used to\r\nbathe the breast of S. Stanislas burning with the love of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nPassing the Benedictine convent, with a courtyard containing an old\r\nsarcophagus as a fountain, and a humble church decorated with rude\r\nfrescoes of St. Benedict and Sta. Scholastica, we reach a small and\r\npopular church, rich in marbles, belonging to the _Perpetua Adoratrice\r\ndel Divin Sacramento del Altare_, founded by sister Maddalena of the\r\nIncarnation, who died 1829, and is buried on the right of the entrance.\r\nHere the low monotonous chant of the perpetual adoration may be\r\nconstantly heard.\r\n\r\nThe _Piazza of the Monte Cavallo_ has in its centre the red granite\r\nobelisk (ninety-five feet high with its base) erected here by Antinori\r\nin 1781, for Pius VI. It was originally brought from Egypt by Claudius,\r\nA.D. 57, together with the obelisk now in front of Sta. Maria Maggiore,\r\nand they were both first placed at the entrance of the mausoleum of\r\nAugustus. At its base are the colossal statues found in the baths of\r\nConstantine, of the Dioscuri Castor and Pollux reining in their horses.\r\nThese statues give a name to the district. Their bases bear the names of\r\nPhidias and Praxiteles, and though their claim to be the work of such\r\ndistinguished sculptors is doubtful, they are certainly of Greek origin.\r\nCopies of these statues at Berlin have received the nicknames of\r\nGehemmter Fortschritt, and Beförderter Rückschritt,--Progress checked\r\nand Retrogression encouraged.\r\n\r\n     \"At the time when the _Mirabilia Romæ_ were published, that is,\r\n     about the thirteenth century, these statues were believed to\r\n     represent the young philosophers, Praxiteles and Phidias, who came\r\n     to Rome during the reign of Tiberius, and promised to tell him his\r\n     most secret words and actions provided he would honour them with a\r\n     monument. Having performed their promise, they obtained these\r\n     statues, which represent them naked, because all human science was\r\n     naked and open to their eyes. From this fable, wild and absurd as\r\n     it is, we may nevertheless draw the inference that the statues had\r\n     been handed down from time immemorial as the works of Phidias and\r\n     Praxiteles, though those artists had in the lapse of ages been\r\n     metamorphosed into philosophers. May we not also assume the\r\n     existence of a tradition that the statues were brought to Rome in\r\n     the reign of Tiberius? In the middle ages the group appears to have\r\n     been accompanied by a statue of Medusa, sitting at their feet, and\r\n     having before her a shell. According to the text of the\r\n     _Mirabilia_, as given by Montfaucon in his _Diarium Italicum_, this\r\n     figure represented the Church. The snakes which surrounded her\r\n     typified the volumes of Scripture, which nobody could approach\r\n     unless he had first been washed--that is, baptized--in the water of\r\n     the shell. But the Prague MS. of the _Mirabilia_ interprets the\r\n     female figure to represent Science, and the serpents to typify the\r\n     disputed questions with which she is concerned.\"--_Dyer's Hist. of\r\n     the City of Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"L'imitation du grand style de Phidias est visible dans plusieurs\r\n     sculptures qu'il a inspirées, et surtout dans les colosses de\r\n     Castor et Pollux, domptant des chevaux, qui ont fait donner à une\r\n     partie du mont Quirinal le nom de _Monte Cavallo_.\r\n\r\n     \"Il ne faut faire aucune attention aux inscriptions qui attribuent\r\n     un des deux colosses à Phidias et l'autre à Praxitèle, Praxitèle\r\n     dont le style n'a rien à faire ici; son nom a été inscrit sur la\r\n     base de l'une des deux statues, comme Phèdre le reprochait déjà à\r\n     des faussaires du temps d'Auguste, qui croyaient augmenter le\r\n     mérite d'un nouvel ouvrage en y mettant le nom de Praxitèle. Quelle\r\n     que soit l'époque où les colosses de Monte Cavallo ont été\r\n     exécutés, malgré quelques différences, on doit affirmer que les\r\n     deux originaux étaient de la même école, de l'école de\r\n     Phidias.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Romaine_, iii. 252.\r\n\r\n     \"Chacun des deux héros dompte d'une seule main un cheval fougueux\r\n     qui se cabre.

H. Clough._\r\n\r\n     \"Before me were the two Monte Cavallo statues, towering\r\n     gigantically above the pygmies of the present day, and looking like\r\n     Titans in the act of threatening heaven. Over my head the stars\r\n     were just beginning to look out, and might have been taken for\r\n     guardian angels keeping watch over the temples below. Behind, and\r\n     on my left, were palaces; on my right, gardens, and hills beyond,\r\n     with the orange tints of sunset over them still glowing in the\r\n     distance. Within a stone's throw of me, in the midst of objects\r\n     thus glorious in themselves, and thus in harmony with each other,\r\n     was stuck an unplaned post, on which glimmered a paper lantern.\r\n     Such is Rome.\"--_Guesses at Truth._\r\n\r\nClose by is a fountain playing into a fine bason of Egyptian granite,\r\nbrought hither by Pius VII. from the Forum, where it had long been used\r\nfor watering cattle.\r\n\r\nOn the left, is the _Palace of the Consulta_, built in 1730 by Clement\r\nXII. (Corsini), from designs of Fuga. Before its gates, under the old\r\nregime, some of the Papal Guardia Nobile were always to be seen sunning\r\nthemselves in a uniform so resplendent that it could scarcely be\r\nbelieved that the pay of this \"noble guard\" of the Pope amounted only to\r\n£5 6_s._ 3_d._ a month!\r\n\r\nOn the right, is the immense _Palace of the Quirinal_, which also\r\nextends along one whole side of the street we have been pursuing.\r\n\r\n     \"That palace-building, ruin-destroying pope, Paul IV., began to\r\n     erect the enormous palace on the Quirinal Hill; and the\r\n     prolongation of his labours, by a long series of successive\r\n     pontiffs, has made it one of the largest and ugliest buildings\r\n     extant.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     The chief, indeed almost the only, interest of this palace arises\r\n     from its having been the favourite residence of Pius VII.\r\n     (Chiaramonte). It was here that he was taken prisoner by the\r\n     French. General Radet forced his way into the pope's room on the\r\n     night of June 6, 1809, and, while excusing himself for being the\r\n     messenger, hastily intimated to the pontiff, in the name of the\r\n     emperor, that he must at once abdicate his temporal sovereignty.\r\n     Pius absolutely refused, upon which he was forced to descend the\r\n     staircase, and found a coach waiting at the entrance of the palace.\r\n     Here the pope paused, his face streaming with tears, and, standing\r\n     in the starlit piazza, solemnly extended his arms in benediction\r\n     over his sleeping people. Then he entered the carriage, followed by\r\n     Cardinal Pacca, and was hurried away to exile.... \"Whirled away\r\n     through the heat and dust of an Italian summer's day, without an\r\n     attendant, without linen, without his spectacles--fevered and\r\n     wearied, he never for a moment lost his serenity. Cardinal Pacca\r\n     tells us, that when they had just started on this most dismal of\r\n     journeys, the pope asked him if he had any money. The secretary of\r\n     state replied that he had had no opportunity of providing himself.\r\n     'We then drew forth our purses,' continues the cardinal, 'and\r\n     notwithstanding the state of affliction we were in at being thus\r\n     torn away from Rome, and all that was dear to us, we could hardly\r\n     compose our countenances, on finding the contents of each purse to\r\n     consist--of the pope's, of a papetto (10_d._), and of mine, of\r\n     three grossi (7½_d._). We had precisely thirty-five baiocchi\r\n     between us. The pope, extending his hand, showed his papetto to\r\n     General Radet, saying, at the same time, 'Look here--this is all I\r\n     possess.'\"[234].... Six years after, Napoleon was sent to St.\r\n     Helena, and Pius VII. returned in triumph to Rome!\r\n\r\nIt was from this same palace that Pius IX.--who has never inhabited it\r\nsince--made his escape to Gaeta during the revolution of 1848, when the\r\nsiege of the Quirinal by the insurgents had succeeded in extorting the\r\nappointment of a democratic ministry.\r\n\r\n     \"On the afternoon of the 24th of November, the Duc d'Harcourt had\r\n     arrived at the Quirinal in his coach as ambassador of France, and\r\n     craved an audience of the sovereign. The guards wondered that he\r\n     stayed so long; but they knew not that he sat reading the\r\n     newspapers in the papal study, while the pope had retired to his\r\n     bed-room to change his dress. Here his major-domo, Filippani, had\r\n     laid out the black cassock and dress of an ordinary priest. The\r\n     pontiff took off his purple stole and white pontifical robe, and\r\n     came forth in the simple garb he had worn in his quiet youth. The\r\n     Duc d'Harcourt threw himself on his knees exclaiming, 'Go forth,\r\n     holy Father; divine wisdom inspires this counsel, divine power will\r\n     lead it to a happy end.' By secret passages and narrow staircases,\r\n     Pius IX. and his trusty servant passed unseen to a little door,\r\n     used only occasionally for the Swiss guards, and by which they were\r\n     to leave the palace. They reached it, and bethought them that the\r\n     key had been forgotten! Filippani hastened back to the papal\r\n     apartment to fetch it; and returning unquestioned to the wicket,\r\n     found the pontiff on his knees, and quite absorbed in prayer. The\r\n     wards were rusty, and the key turned with difficulty; but the door\r\n     was opened at last, and the holy fugitive and his servant quickly\r\n     entered a poor hackney coach that was waiting for them outside.\r\n     Here, again, they ran risk of being discovered through the\r\n     thoughtless adherence to old etiquette of the other servant, who\r\n     stood by the coach, and who, having let down the steps, knelt, as\r\n     usual, before he shut the door.\r\n\r\n     \"The pope wore a dark great coat over his priest's cassock, a\r\n     low-crowned round hat, and a broad brown woollen neckcloth outside\r\n     his straight Roman collar. Filippani had on his usual loose cloak;\r\n     but under this he carried the three-cornered hat of the pope, a\r\n     bundle of the most private and secret papers, the papal seals, the\r\n     breviary, the cross-embroidered slippers, a small quantity of\r\n     linen, and a little box full of gold medals stamped with the\r\n     likeness of his Holiness. From the inside of the carriage, he\r\n     directed the coachman to follow many winding and diverging streets,\r\n     in the hope of misleading the spies, who were known to swarm at\r\n     every corner. Beside the Church of SS. Pietro e Marcellino, in the\r\n     deserted quarter beyond the Coliseum, they found the Bavarian\r\n     minister, Count Spaur, waiting in his own private carriage, and\r\n     imagining every danger which could have detained them so long. The\r\n     sovereign pressed the hand of his faithful Filippani, and entered\r\n     the Count's carriage. Silently they drove on through the old gate\r\n     of Rome,--Count Spaur having there shown the passport of the\r\n     Bavarian minister going to Naples on affairs of state.\r\n\r\n     \"Meanwhile the Duc d'Harcourt grew tired of reading the newspapers\r\n     in the pope's study; and when he thought that his Holiness must be\r\n     far beyond the walls of Rome, he left the palace, and taking\r\n     post-horses, hastened with all speed to overtake the fugitive on\r\n     the road to Civita Vecchia, whither he believed him to be flying.\r\n     As he left the study in the Quirinal, a prelate entered with a\r\n     large bundle of ecclesiastical papers, on which, he said, he had to\r\n     confer with the pope; then his chamberlain went in to read to him\r\n     his breviary, and the office of the day. The rooms were lighted up,\r\n     and the supper taken in as usual; and at length it was stated that\r\n     his Holiness, feeling somewhat unwell, had retired to rest; and his\r\n     attendants, and the guard of honour, were dismissed for the night.\r\n     It is true that a certain prelate, who chanced to see the little\r\n     door by which the fugitive had escaped into the street left open,\r\n     began to cry out, 'The pope has escaped! the pope has escaped!' But\r\n     Prince Gabrielli was beside him; and, clapping his hand upon the\r\n     mouth of the alarmist, silenced him in time, by whispering, 'Be\r\n     quiet, Monsignore; be quiet, or we shall be cut to pieces!'\r\n\r\n     \"Near La Riccia, the fugitives found Countess Spaur (who had\r\n     arranged the whole plan of the escape) waiting with a coach and six\r\n     horses--in which they pursued their journey to Gaeta, reaching the\r\n     Neapolitan frontier between five and six in the morning. The pope\r\n     throughout carried with him the sacrament in the pyx which Pius the\r\n     Seventh carried when he was taken prisoner to France, and which, as\r\n     if with prescience of what would happen, had been lately sent to\r\n     him as a memorial by the Bishop of Avignon.\"--_Beste._\r\n\r\nIt is in the Quirinal Palace that the later conclaves have always met\r\nfor the election of the popes.\r\n\r\n     \"In the afternoon of the last day of the novendiali, as they are\r\n     called, after the death of a pope, the cardinals assemble (at S.\r\n     Sylvestro a Monte Cavallo), and walk in procession, accompanied by\r\n     their conclavisti, a secretary, a chaplain, and a servant or two,\r\n     to the great gate of the royal residence, in which one will remain\r\n     as master and supreme lord. Of course the hill is crowded by\r\n     persons, lining the avenue kept open for the procession. Cardinals\r\n     never before seen by them, or not for many years, pass before\r\n     them; eager eyes scan and measure them, and try to conjecture, from\r\n     fancied omens in eye, in figure, or in expression, who will be\r\n     shortly the sovereign of their fair city; and, what is much more,\r\n     the head of the Catholic Church, from the rising to the setting\r\n     sun. They all enter equal over the threshold of that gate: they\r\n     share together the supreme rule, spiritual and temporal: there is\r\n     still embosomed in them all, the voice yet silent, that will soon\r\n     sound from one tongue over all the world, and the dormant germ of\r\n     that authority which will soon again be concentrated in one man\r\n     alone. To-day they are all equal; perhaps to-morrow one will sit\r\n     enthroned, and all the rest will kiss his feet; one will be\r\n     sovereign, and others his subjects; one the shepherd, and the\r\n     others his flock.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"From the Quirinal Palace stretches out, the length of a whole\r\n     street, an immense wing, divided in its two upper floors into a\r\n     great number of small but complete suites of apartments, occupied\r\n     permanently, or occasionally, by persons attached to the Court.\r\n     During conclave these are allotted, literally so, to the cardinals,\r\n     each of whom lives apart with his own attendants. His food is\r\n     brought daily from his own house, and is overhauled, and delivered\r\n     to him in the shape of 'broken victuals,' by the watchful guardians\r\n     of the _turns_ and lattices, through which alone anything, even\r\n     conversation, can penetrate into the seclusion of that sacred\r\n     retreat. For a few hours, the first evening, the doors are left\r\n     open, and the nobility, the diplomatic body, and, in fact, all\r\n     presentable persons, may roam from cell to cell, paying a brief\r\n     compliment to its occupant, perhaps speaking the same good wishes\r\n     to fifty, which they know can only be accomplished in one. After\r\n     that, all is closed; a wicket is left accessible for any cardinal\r\n     to enter, who is not yet arrived; but every aperture is jealously\r\n     guarded by faithful janitors, judges and prelates of various\r\n     tribunals, who relieve one another. Every letter even is opened and\r\n     read, that no communications may be held with the outer world. The\r\n     very street on which the wing of the conclave looks is barricaded\r\n     and guarded by a picquet at each end; and as, fortunately, opposite\r\n     there are no private residences, and all the buildings have access\r\n     from the back, no inconvenience is thereby created.... In the mean\r\n     time, within, and unseen from without, _fervet opus_.\r\n\r\n     \"Twice a day the cardinals meet in the chapel belonging to the\r\n     palace, included in the enclosure, and there, on tickets so\r\n     arranged that the voter's name cannot be seen, write the name of\r\n     him for whom they give their suffrage. These papers are examined in\r\n     their presence, and if the number of votes given to any one do not\r\n     constitute the majority, they are burnt in such a manner that the\r\n     smoke, issuing through a flue, is visible to the crowd usually\r\n     assembled in the square outside. Some day, instead of this usual\r\n     signal to disperse, the sound of pick and hammer is heard, a small\r\n     opening is seen in the wall which had temporarily blocked up the\r\n     great window over the palace gateway. At last the masons of the\r\n     conclave have opened a rude door, through which steps out on the\r\n     balcony the first Cardinal Deacon, and proclaims to the many, or to\r\n     the few, who may happen to be in waiting, that they again possess a\r\n     sovereign and a pontiff.\"--_Cardinal Wiseman._\r\n\r\n     \"Sais-tu ce que c'est qu'un conclave? Une réunion de vieillards,\r\n     moins occupés du ciel que de la terre, et dont quelques-uns se font\r\n     plus maladifs, plus goutteux, et plus cacochymes qu'ils ne le sont\r\n     encore, dans l'espérance d'inspirer un vif interêt à leurs\r\n     partisans. Grand nombre d'éminences ne renonçant jamais à la\r\n     possibilité d'une élection, le rival le plus près de la tombe\r\n     excite toujours le moins de répugnance. Un rhumatisme est ici un\r\n     titre à la confiance; l'hydropisie a ses partisans: car l'ambition\r\n     et la mort comptent sur les mêmes chances. Le cercueil sert comme\r\n     de marchepied au trône; et il y a tel pieux candidat qui\r\n     négocierait avec son concurrent, si la durée du nouveau règne\r\n     pouvait avoir son terme obligatoire comme celui d'un effet de\r\n     commerce. Eh! ne sais-tu pas toi-même que le pâtre d'Ancône brûla\r\n     gaiement ses béquilles dès qu'il eut ceint la tiare; et que Léon\r\n     X., élu à trente-huit ans, avait eu grand soin de ne guérir d'un\r\n     mal mortel que le lendemain de son couronnement?\"--_Lorenzo\r\n     Ganganelli (Clement XIV.) à Carlo Bertinazzi, Avril 16, 1769._\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of the Popes the palace was shown from 12 A.M. to 4 P.M.\r\non presentation of a ticket, which could easily be obtained through a\r\nbanker. It was stripped of all historical memorials and contained very\r\nfew fine pictures, so was little worth visiting. Since the winter of\r\n1870--71 the palace has been appropriated as the residence of the\r\nSardinian Royal Family.\r\n\r\nOn the landing of the principal staircase, in a bad light, is a very\r\nimportant fresco by _Melozzo da Forli_, a rare master of the Paduan\r\nschool.[235]\r\n\r\n     \"On the vaulted ceiling of a chapel in the Church of the SS.\r\n     Apostoli at Rome, Melozzo executed a work (1472) which, in those\r\n     times, can have admitted of comparison with few. When the chapel\r\n     was rebuilt in the eighteenth century some fragments were saved.\r\n     That comprehending the Creator between angels was removed to a\r\n     staircase in the Quirinal palace, while single figures of angels\r\n     were placed in the sacristy of St. Peter's. These detached portions\r\n     suffice to show a beauty and fulness of form, and a combination of\r\n     earthly and spiritual grandeur, comparable in their way to the\r\n     noblest productions of Titian, although in mode of execution rather\r\n     recalling Coreggio. Here, as in the cupola frescoes of Coreggio\r\n     himself, half a century later, we trace that constant effort at\r\n     true perspective of the figure, hardly in character, perhaps, with\r\n     high ecclesiastical art; the drapery, also, is of a somewhat\r\n     formless description; but the grandeur of the principal figure, the\r\n     grace and freshness of the little adoring cherubs, and the elevated\r\n     beauty of the angels are expressed with an easy naïveté, to which\r\n     only the best works of Mantegna and Signorelli can\r\n     compare.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nPassing through a great hall, one hundred and ninety feet long, we are\r\nshown a number of rooms fitted up by Pius VII. and Gregory XVI. for the\r\npapal summer residence. They contain few objects of interest. In one\r\nchamber is a Last Supper by _Baroccio_;--in the next a fine tapestry\r\nrepresenting the marriage of Louis XIV. The following rooms contain some\r\ngood Gobelin tapestries.\r\n\r\nSeveral apartments have mosaic pavements, brought hither from pagan\r\nedifices. The chamber is shown in which Pius VII. died,--the bed has\r\nbeen changed. In the next room--an audience chamber--he was taken\r\nprisoner. Here is a curious ancient pietra-dura of the\r\nAnnunciation,--the ceiling is painted by Overbeck. In one of the\r\nfollowing rooms are some pictures, including--\r\n\r\n    S. Giorgio: _Pordenone_.\r\n\r\n     \"One picture especially attracted me at the Quirinal; a St. George,\r\n     the conqueror of the dragon, and deliverer of the maiden. No one\r\n     could tell me the name of the master, till a modest little man\r\n     stepped forward, and told me the picture was by Pordenone the\r\n     Venetian, one of his best works, showing all his merits. This quite\r\n     explained my liking for it; the picture had struck me, because\r\n     being best acquainted with the Venetian school, I could best\r\n     appreciate the merits of one of its masters.\"--_Goethe, Romische\r\n     Briefe._\r\n\r\n    Marriage of S. Catherine: _Battoni_.\r\n    St. Peter and St. Paul: _Fra Bartolomeo_.\r\n\r\n     \"The two standing figures of St. Peter and St. Paul, as large as\r\n     life, were executed during a short residence in Rome. The first was\r\n     completed by Raphael after Fra Bartolomeo's departure.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nThe room which is decorated with a fine modern tapestry of the martyrdom\r\nof St. Stephen, has a plaster frieze, being the original cast of the\r\nTriumph of Alexander the Great, modelled for Napoleon by _Thorwaldsen_.\r\nOne of the last rooms shown is a kind of picture gallery. Among the best\r\nworks here are:--\r\n\r\n    Saul and David: _Guercino_.\r\n    Ecce Homo: _Domenichino_.\r\n    St. Jerome: _Spagnoletto_.\r\n    The Flight into Egypt: _Baroccio_.\r\n\r\nHere also is a worthless picture of the Battle of Mentana, presented to\r\nPius IX. by the English Catholic ladies.\r\n\r\nThe _Private Chapel of the Pope_, opening from this gallery, contains a\r\nmagnificent picture of the Annunciation by _Guido_, and frescoes of the\r\nlife of the Virgin by _Albani_. The great hall of the Consistory, a bare\r\nroom with benches, has a fresco of the Virgin and Child by _Carlo\r\nMaratta_, over an altar.\r\n\r\nThe _Gardens of the Quirinal_ can be visited with an order from 8 to 12\r\nA.M. They are in the stiff style of box hedges and clipped avenues,\r\nwhich seems to belong especially to Rome, and which we know to have\r\nbeen popular here even in imperial times. Pliny, in his account of his\r\nTusculan villa, describes his gardens decorated with \"figures of\r\ndifferent animals, cut in box: evergreens clipped into a thousand\r\ndifferent shapes; sometimes into letters forming different names; walls\r\nand hedges of cut box, and trees twisted into a variety of forms.\" But\r\nthe Quirinal gardens are also worth visiting, on account of the many\r\npretty glimpses they afford of St. Peter's and other distant buildings,\r\nand the oddity of some of the devices--an organ played by water, &c. The\r\nCasino, built by Fuga, has frescoes by _Orizonti_, _Pompeo Battoni_, and\r\n_Pannini_.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the left on issuing from the palace, we reach--on the\r\nleft--the entrance to the courtyard of the vast _Palazzo Rospigliosi_,\r\nbuilt by Flaminio Ponzio, in 1603, for Cardinal Scipio Borghese, on a\r\nportion of the site of the Baths of Constantine. It was inhabited by\r\nCardinal Bentivoglio, and sold by him to Cardinal Mazarin, who enlarged\r\nit from designs of Carlo Maderno. From his time to 1704 it was inhabited\r\nby French ambassadors, and it then passed to the Rospigliosi family. The\r\npresent Prince Rospigliosi inhabits the second floor, his brother,\r\nPrince Pallavicini, the first.\r\n\r\nThe palace itself (well known from its hospitalities) is not shown, but\r\nthe _Casino_ is open on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It is situated at the\r\nend of a very small but pretty garden planted with magnolias, and\r\nconsists of three chambers. On the roof of the central room is the\r\nfamous Aurora of Guido.\r\n\r\n     \"Guido's Aurora is the very type of haste and impetus; for surely\r\n     no man ever imagined such hurry and tumult, such sounding and\r\n     clashing. Painters maintain that it is lighted from two\r\n     sides,--they have my full permission to light theirs from three if\r\n     it will improve them, but the difference lies\r\n     elsewhere.\"--_Mendelssohn's Letters_, p. 91.\r\n\r\n     \"This is the noblest work of Guido. It is embodied poetry. The\r\n     Hours, that hand in hand encircle the car of Phœbus, advance\r\n     with rapid pace. The paler, milder forms of those gentle sisters\r\n     who rule over declining day, and the glowing glance of those who\r\n     bask in the meridian blaze, resplendent in the hues of heaven,--are\r\n     of no mortal grace and beauty; but they are eclipsed by Aurora\r\n     herself, who sails on the golden clouds before them, shedding\r\n     'showers of shadowing roses' on the rejoicing earth; her celestial\r\n     presence diffusing gladness, and light, and beauty around. Above\r\n     the heads of the heavenly coursers, hovers the morning star, in the\r\n     form of a youthful cherub, bearing his flaming torch. Nothing is\r\n     more admirable in this beautiful composition than the motion given\r\n     to the whole. The smooth and rapid step of the circling Hours as\r\n     they tread on the fleecy clouds; the fiery steeds; the whirling\r\n     wheels of the car; the torch of Lucifer, blown back by the velocity\r\n     of his advance; and the form of Aurora, borne through the ambient\r\n     air, till you almost fear she should float from your\r\n     sight.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"The work of Guido is more poetic than that of Guercino, and\r\n     luminous, and soft, and harmonious. Cupid, Aurora, Phœbus, form\r\n     a climax of beauty, and the Hours seem as light as the clouds on\r\n     which they dance.\"--_Forsyth._\r\n\r\n     Lanzi points out that Guido always took the Venus de Medici and the\r\n     Niobe as his favourite models, and that there is scarcely one of\r\n     his large pictures in which the Niobe or one of her sons is not\r\n     introduced, yet with such dexterity, that the theft is scarcely\r\n     perceptible.\r\n\r\nThe frescoes of the frieze are by _Tempesta;_ the landscapes by _Paul\r\nBrill_. In the hall are busts, statues, and a bronze horse found in the\r\nruins of the Baths.\r\n\r\nThere is a small collection of pictures--the only work of real\r\nimportance being the beautiful _Daniele di Volterra_ of our Saviour\r\nbearing his cross, in the room on the left. In the same room are two\r\nlarge pictures, David triumphing with the head of Goliath,\r\n_Domenichino_; and Perseus rescuing Andromeda, _Guido_. In the room on\r\nthe right are, Adam gathering fig-leaves for Eve, in a Paradise which is\r\ncrowded with animals like a menagerie, _Domenichino_; and Samson pulling\r\ndown the pillars upon the Philistines, _Ludovico Caracci_.\r\n\r\nA second small garden belonging to this palace is well worth seeing in\r\nMay from the wealth of camellias, azaleas, and roses, with which it is\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Rospigliosi Palace, by ringing at a gate in the wall, we\r\ngain admission to the _Colonna Gardens_ (connected with the palace in\r\nthe Piazza SS. Apostoli, by a series of bridges across the intervening\r\nstreet). Here, on a lofty terrace which has a fine view towards the\r\nCapitol, and overshadowed by grand cypresses, are the colossal remains\r\nof the _Temple of the Sun_ (huge fragments of cornice) built by Aurelian\r\n(A.D. 270--75). At the other end of the terrace, looking down through\r\ntwo barns into a kind of pit, we can see some remains of the _Baths of\r\nConstantine_--built A.D. 326--and of the great staircase which led up to\r\nthem from the valley below. The portico of these baths remained erect\r\ntill the time of Clement XII. (1730--40), and was adorned with four\r\nmarble statues, of which two--those of the two Constantines--may now be\r\nseen on the terrace of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nBeneath the magnificent cypress-trees on the slope of the hill are\r\nseveral fine sarcophagi. Only the stem is preserved of the grand\r\nhistorical pine-tree, which was planted on the day on which Cola di\r\nRienzi died, and which was one of the great ornaments of the city till\r\n1848, when it was broken in a storm.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the end of the garden, are the great _Convent_ and _Church\r\nof S. Silvestro a Monte Cavallo_--belonging to the Missionaries of St.\r\nVincent de Paul--in which the Cardinals meet before going in procession\r\nto the Conclave. It contains a few rather good pictures. The cupola of\r\nthe second chapel has frescoes by _Domenichino_, of David dancing before\r\nthe Ark,--the Queen of Sheba and Solomon,--Judith with the head of\r\nHolofernes,--and Esther fainting before Ahasueras. These are considered\r\nby Lanzi as some of the finest frescoes of the master. In the left\r\ntransept is a chapel containing a picture of the Assumption, painted on\r\nslate, considered the masterpiece of _Scipione Gaetani_. The last chapel\r\nbut one on the left has a ceiling by _Cav. d'Arpino_, and frescoes on\r\nthe walls by _Polidoro da Caravaggio_. The picture over the altar,\r\nrepresenting St. Dominic and St. Catherine of Siena, is by _Mariotto\r\nAlbertinelli_. Cardinal Bentivoglio--who wrote the history of the wars\r\nin Flanders, and lived in the Rospigliosi Palace--is buried here.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the height of Maganaopoli, from which the isthmus which\r\njoined the Quirinal to the Capitoline was cut away by Trajan. Here is a\r\ncross-ways. On the right is a descent to the Forum of Trajan, at the\r\nside of which is the villa of Cardinal Antonelli, and beyond it, the\r\nhandsome modern palace of Count Trapani, cousin to the King of Naples.\r\n\r\nOpposite, is the _Church of Sta. Caterina di Siena_, possessing some\r\nfrescoes attributed, on doubtful grounds, to the rare master _Timoteo\r\ndella Vite_. Adjoining, is a large convent, enclosed within the\r\nprecincts of which is the tall brick mediæval tower, sometimes called\r\nthe Tower of Nero, but generally known as the _Torre delle Milizie_,\r\n_i.e._ the Roman Militia. It was erected by the sons of Peter Alexius, a\r\nbaron attached to the party of the Senator Pandolfo de Suburra. The\r\nlower part is said to have been built in 1210, the upper in 1294 and\r\n1330.\r\n\r\n     \"People pass through two regular courses of study at Rome,--the\r\n     first in learning, and the second in unlearning.\r\n\r\n     \"'This is the tower of Nero, from which he saw the city in\r\n     flames,--and this is the temple of Concord,--and this is the temple\r\n     of Castor and Pollux,--and this is the temple of Vesta,--and these\r\n     are the baths of Paulus-Æmilius,'--and so on, says your lacquey.\r\n\r\n     \"'This is not the tower of Nero,--nor that the temple of Castor and\r\n     Pollux,--nor the other the temple of Concord,--nor are any of these\r\n     things what they are called,' says your antiquary.\"--_Eaton's\r\n     Rome._\r\n\r\nThe Convent of Sta. Caterina was built by the celebrated Vittoria\r\nColonna, who requested the advice of Michael Angelo on the subject, and\r\nwas told that she had better make the ancient \"Torre\" into a belfry. A\r\nvery curious account of the interview in which this subject was\r\ndiscussed, and which took place in the Church of S. Silvestro a Monte\r\nCavallo, is left us in the memoirs of Francesco d'Olanda, a Portuguese\r\npainter, who was himself present at the conversation.\r\n\r\nNear this point are two other fine mediæval towers. One is to the right\r\nof the descent to the Forum of Trajan, being that of the Colonnas, now\r\ncalled _Tor di Babele_, ornamented with three beautiful fragments of\r\nsculptured frieze, one of them bearing the device of the Colonna, a\r\ncrowned column rising from a wreath. The other tower, immediately facing\r\nus, is called _Torre del Grillo_, from the ancient family of that name.\r\n\r\nOpposite Sta. Caterina is the handsome _Church of SS. Domenico e Sisto_,\r\napproached by a good double twisted staircase. Over the second altar on\r\nthe left is a picture of the marriage of St. Catherine by _Allegrani_,\r\nand, on the anniversary of her (visionary) marriage (July 19), the dried\r\nhand of the saint is exhibited here to the unspeakable comfort of the\r\nfaithful.\r\n\r\nTurning by this church into the Via Maganaopoli (formerly Baganaopoli, a\r\ncorruption of Balnea Pauli--Baths of Emilius Paulus), we pass on the\r\nleft the _Palazzo Aldobrandini_, with a bright pleasant-looking court\r\nand handsome fountain. The present Prince Aldobrandini is brother of\r\nPrince Borghese. Of this family was S. Pietro Aldobrandini, generally\r\nknown as S. Pietro Igneo, who was canonized because, in 1067, he walked\r\nunhurt, crucifix in hand, through a burning fiery furnace ten feet long\r\nbefore the church door of Settimo, near Florence, to prove an accusation\r\nof simony which he had brought against Pietro di Pavia, bishop of that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIn the Via di Mazzarini, in the hollow between the Quirinal and Viminal,\r\nis the _Convent of Sta. Agata in Suburra_, through the courtyard of\r\nwhich we enter the _Church of Sta. Agata dei Goti_. A tradition declares\r\nthat this (like S. Sabba on the Aventine) is on the site of a house of\r\nSta. Silvia, mother of St. Gregory the Great, who consecrated the church\r\nafter it had been plundered by the Goths, and dedicated it to Sta.\r\nAgata. It was rebuilt by Ricimer, the king-maker, in A.D. 472. Twelve\r\nancient granite columns and a handsome opus-alexandrinum pavement are\r\nits only signs of antiquity. The church now belongs to the Irish\r\nSeminary. In the left aisle is the monument of Daniel O'Connell, with\r\nbas-reliefs by Benzoni, inscribed:--\r\n\r\n     \"This monument contains the heart of O'Connell, who dying at Genoa\r\n     on his way to the Eternal City, bequeathed his soul to God, his\r\n     body to Ireland, and his heart to Rome. He is represented at the\r\n     bar of the British House of Commons in MDCCCXXIII., when he refused\r\n     to take the anti-catholic declaration, in these remarkable\r\n     words--'I at once reject this declaration; part of it I believe to\r\n     be untrue, and the rest I know to be false.' He was born vi. Aug.\r\n     MDCCLXXVI., and died xv. May, MDCCCXLVIII. Erected by Charles\r\n     Bianconi, the faithful friend of the immortal liberator, and of\r\n     Ireland the land of his adoption.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the left aisle is a chapel, which Cardinal Antonelli (who\r\nhas his palace near this) decorated, 1863, with frescoes and arabesques\r\nas a burial-place for his family. In the opposite chapel is a gilt\r\nfigure of Sta. Agata carrying her breasts--showing the manner in which\r\nshe suffered.\r\n\r\n     \"Agatha was a maiden of Catania, in Sicily, whither Decius the\r\n     emperor sent Quintianus as governor. He, inflamed by the beauty of\r\n     Agatha, tempted her with rich gifts and promises, but she repulsed\r\n     him with disdain. Then Quintianus ordered her to be bound and\r\n     beaten with rods, and sent two of his slaves to tear her bosom with\r\n     iron shears, and as her blood flowed forth, she said to him, 'O\r\n     thou cruel tyrant! art thou not ashamed to treat me thus--hast thou\r\n     not thyself been fed at thy mother's breasts?' Thus only did she\r\n     murmur. And in the night a venerable man came to her, bearing a\r\n     vase of ointment, and before him walked a youth bearing a torch. It\r\n     was the holy apostle Peter, and the youth was an angel; but Agatha\r\n     knew it not; though such a glorious light filled the prison, that\r\n     the guards fled in terror.... Then St. Peter made himself known and\r\n     ministered to her, restoring with heavenly balm her wounded\r\n     breasts.\r\n\r\n     \"Quintianus, infuriated, demanded who had healed her. She replied,\r\n     'He whom I confess and adore with heart and lips, he hath sent his\r\n     apostle who hath healed me.' Then Quintianus caused her to be\r\n     thrown bound upon a great fire, but instantly an earthquake arose,\r\n     and the people in terror cried, 'This visitation is sent because of\r\n     the sufferings of the maiden Agatha.' So he caused her to be taken\r\n     from the fire, and carried back to prison, where she prayed aloud\r\n     that having now proved her faith, she might be freed from pain and\r\n     see the glory of God;--and her prayer was answered and her spirit\r\n     instantly departed into eternal glory, Feb. 5, A.D. 251.\"--_From\r\n     the \"Legende delle SS. Vergini.\"_\r\n\r\nAgatha (patroness of Catania) is one of the saints most reverenced by\r\nthe Roman people. On the 5th of February her vespers are sung here,\r\nwhich contain the antiphons:--\r\n\r\n     \"Who art thou that art come to heal my wounds?--I am an apostle of\r\n     Christ, doubt not concerning me, my daughter.\r\n\r\n     \"Medicine for the body have I never used; but I have the Lord Jesus\r\n     Christ, who with his word alone restoreth all things.\r\n\r\n     \"I render thanks to thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, for that thou hast\r\n     been mindful of me, and hast sent thine apostle to heal my wounds.\r\n\r\n     \"I bless thee, O Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, because through\r\n     thine apostle thou hast restored my breasts to me.\r\n\r\n     \"Him who hath vouchsafed to heal me of every wound, and to restore\r\n     to me my breasts, him do I invoke, even the living God.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Blessed Agatha, standing in her prison, stretched forth her hands\r\n     and prayed unto the Lord, saying, 'O Lord Jesus Christ, my good\r\n     master, I thank thee because thou hast given me strength to\r\n     overcome the tortures of the executioners; and now, Lord, speak the\r\n     word, that I may depart hence to thy glory which fadeth not away.\"\r\n\r\nThe tomb of John Lascaris (a refugee from Constantinople when taken by\r\nthe Turks) has--in Greek--the inscription:--\r\n\r\n     \"Lascaris lies here in a foreign grave; but, stranger, that does\r\n     not disturb him, rather does he rejoice; yet he is not without\r\n     sorrow, as a Grecian, that his fatherland will not bestow upon him\r\n     the freedom of a grave.\"\r\n\r\nPassing the great Convent of S. Bernardino Senensis, we reach the Via\r\ndei Serpenti, interesting as occupying the supposed site of the Vallis\r\nQuirinalis, where Julius Proculus, returning from Alba Longa,\r\nencountered the ghost of Romulus:\r\n\r\n    \"Sed Proculus Longâ veniebat Julius Albâ;\r\n      Lunaque fulgebat; nec facis usus erat:\r\n    Cum subito motu nubes crepuere sinistræ:\r\n      Retulit ille gradus, horrueruntque comæ.\r\n    Pulcher, et humano major, trabeâque decorus,\r\n      Romulus in mediâ visus adesse viâ.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ ii. 498.\r\n\r\nTurning to the right down the Via dei Serpenti, we reach the Piazza Sta.\r\nMaria in Monti, containing a fountain, and a church dedicated to SS.\r\nSergius and Bacchus, two martyrs who suffered under Maximian at Rasapha\r\nin Syria.\r\n\r\nOne side of this piazza is occupied by the _Church of Sta. Maria in\r\nMonti_, in which is deposited a figure of the beggar Labre (canonized by\r\nPius IX. in 1860), dressed in the gown of a mendicant-pilgrim, which he\r\nwore when living. Over the altar is a picture of him in the Coliseum,\r\ndistributing to his fellow-beggars the alms which he had obtained. His\r\nfête is observed here on April 16. (At No. 3 Via dei Serpenti, one may\r\nvisit the chamber in which Labre died--and in the Via dei Crociferi,\r\nnear the fountain of Trevi, a chapel containing many of his relics,--the\r\nbed on which he died, the crucifix which he wore in his bosom, &c.)\r\n\r\n     \"Benoît Joseph Labre naquit en 1748 dans le diocèse de Boulogne\r\n     (France) de parents chrétiens et jouissant d'une modeste aisance.\r\n     D'une piété vive et tendre, il voulut d'abord se faire religieux;\r\n     mais sa santé ne put résister, ni aux règles des Chartreux, ni à\r\n     celles des Trappistes, chez lesquels il entra successivement. _Il\r\n     fut alors sollicité intérieurement_, est il dit dans la notice sur\r\n     sa vie, _de mener une vie de pénitence et de charité au milieu du\r\n     siècle_. Pendant sept années, il parcourut en pèlerin-mendiant,\r\n     les sanctuaires de la Vierge les plus vénérés de toute l'Europe; on\r\n     a calculé qu'il fit, à pied, plus de cinq mille lieues, pendant ces\r\n     sept années.\r\n\r\n     \"En 1777, il revint en Italie, pour ne plus en sortir. Il habitait\r\n     Rome, faisant seulement une fois chaque année, le pèlerinage de\r\n     Lorète. Il passait une grande partie de ses journées dans les\r\n     églises, mendiait, et faisait des œuvres de charité. Il couchait\r\n     quelquefois sous le portique des églises, et le plus souvent au\r\n     Colysée derrière la petite chapelle de la cinquième station du\r\n     chemin de la croix. L'église qu'il fréquentait le plus, était celle\r\n     de Ste. Marie des Monts; le 16 Avril, 1783, après y avoir prié fort\r\n     longtemps, en sortant, il tomba, comme évanoui, sur les marches du\r\n     péristyle de l'église. On le transporta dans une maison voisine, où\r\n     il mourut le soir.\"--_Une Année à Rome._\r\n\r\nAlmost opposite this church, a narrow alley, which appears to be a\r\n_cul-de-sac_ ending in a picture of the Crucifixion, is in reality the\r\napproach to the carefully concealed _Convent of the Farnesiani Nuns_,\r\ngenerally known as the _Sepolte Vive_. The only means of communicating\r\nwith them is by rapping on a barrel which projects from a wall on a\r\nplatform above the roofs of the houses,--when a muffled voice is heard\r\nfrom the interior,--and if your references are satisfactory, the barrel\r\nturns round and eventually discloses a key by which the initiated can\r\nadmit themselves to a small chamber in the interior of the convent. Over\r\nits door is an inscription, bidding those who enter that chamber to\r\nleave all worldly thoughts behind them. Round the walls are\r\ninscribed,--\"Qui non diligit, manet in morti.\"--\"Militia est vita\r\nhominis super terram.\"--\"Alter alterius onera portate\"; and, on the\r\nother side, opposite the door,\r\n\r\n    \"Vi esorto a rimirar\r\n      La vita del mondo\r\n    Nella guisa che la mira\r\n      Un moribondo.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of the walls is an opening with a double grille, beyond which is\r\na metal plate, pierced with holes like the rose of a watering-pot. It is\r\nbeyond this grille and behind this plate, that the abbess of the Sepolte\r\nVive receives her visitors, but she is even then veiled from head to\r\nfoot in heavy folds of thick bure. Gregory XVI., who of course could\r\npenetrate within the convent and who wished to try her, said, \"Sorella\r\nmia, levate il velo.\" \"No, mio padre,\" she replied, \"E vietato dalla\r\nnostra regola.\"\r\n\r\nThe nuns of the Sepolte Vive are never seen again after they once assume\r\nthe black veil, though they are allowed double the ordinary noviciate.\r\nThey never hear anything of the outer world, even of the deaths of their\r\nnearest relations. Daily, they are said to dig their own graves and lie\r\ndown in them, and their remaining hours are occupied in perpetual and\r\nmonotonous adoration of the Blessed Sacrament.\r\n\r\nReturning as far as the Via Pane e Perna (a continuation of the Via\r\nMaganaopoli) we ascend the slope of the _Viminal Hill_, now with\r\ndifficulty to be distinguished from the Quirinal. It derives its name\r\nfrom _vimina_, osiers, and was once probably covered with woods, since a\r\ntemple of Sylvanus or Pan was one of several which adorned its principal\r\nstreet--the Vicus Longus--the site of which is now marked by the\r\ncountrified lane called Via S. Vitale. This end of the hill is crowned\r\nby the _Church of S. Lorenzo Pane e Perna_, built on the site of the\r\nmartyrdom of the deacon St. Laurence, who suffered under Claudius II.,\r\nin A.D. 264, for refusing to give up the goods of the Church. Over the\r\naltar is a huge fresco, representing the saint extended upon a red-hot\r\ngridiron, and below--entered from the exterior of the church--a crypt\r\nis shown as the scene of his cruel sufferings.[236]\r\n\r\n     \"Blessed Laurentius, as he lay stretched and burning on the\r\n     gridiron, said to the impious tyrant, 'The meat is done, make haste\r\n     hither and eat. As for the treasures of the Church which you seek,\r\n     the hands of the poor have carried them to a heavenly\r\n     treasury.'\"--_Antiphon of St. Laurence._\r\n\r\nThe funeral of St. Bridget of Sweden took place in this church, July\r\n1373, but after resting here for a year, her body was removed by her son\r\nto the monastery of Wastein in Sweden.\r\n\r\nUnder the second altar on the right are shown the relics of St. Crispin\r\nand St. Crispinian, \"two holy brothers, who departed from Rome with St.\r\nDenis to preach the Gospel in France, where, after the example of St.\r\nPaul, they laboured with their hands, being by trade shoemakers. And\r\nthese good saints made shoes for the poor without fee or reward (for\r\nwhich the angels supplied them with leather), until, denounced as\r\nChristians, they suffered martyrdom at Soissons, being, after many\r\ntortures, beheaded by the sword (A.D. 300).\"[237] The festival of St.\r\nCrispin and St. Crispinian is held on October 25, the anniversary of the\r\nbattle of Agincourt.\r\n\r\n    \"And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,\r\n    From this day to the ending of the world,\r\n    But we in it shall be remembered.\"\r\n\r\n    _Shakespeare, Henry V._\r\n\r\nThroughout the middle ages the statues of Posidippus and Menander, now\r\nin the gallery of statues at the Vatican, were kissed and worshipped in\r\nthis church under the impression that they represented saints (see Ch.\r\nXV.). They were found on this site, which was once occupied by the baths\r\nof Olympias, daughter-in-law of Constantine.\r\n\r\nThe strange name of the church, Pane e Perna, is supposed to have had\r\nits origin in a dole of bread and ham once given at the door of the\r\nadjacent convent. In the garden belonging to the convent is a mediæval\r\nhouse of _c._ 1200. The campanile is of 1450.\r\n\r\nThe small neighbouring _Church of S. Lorenzo in Fonte_ covers the site\r\nof the prison of St. Lawrence, and a fountain is shown there as that in\r\nwhich he baptized Vicus Patricius and his daughter Lucilla, whom he\r\nmiraculously raised from the dead.\r\n\r\nDescending the hill below the church--in the valley between the\r\nEsquiline and Viminal--we reach at the corner of the street a spot of\r\npreëminent historical interest, as that where Servius Tullius was\r\nkilled, and where Tullia (B.C. 535) drove in her chariot over the dead\r\nbody of her father. The Vicus Urbius by which the old king had reached\r\nthe spot is now represented by the Via Urbana; the Vicus Cyprius, by\r\nwhich he was about to ascend to the palace on the hill Cispius, by the\r\nVia di Sta. Maria Maggiore.\r\n\r\n     \"Servius-Tullius, après avoir pris le chemin raccourci qui partait\r\n     du pied de la Velia et allait du côté des Carines, atteignit le\r\n     Vicus-Cyprius (Via Urbana).\r\n\r\n     \"Parvenu à l'extrémité du Vicus-Cyprius, le roi fut atteint et\r\n     assassiné par les gens de Tarquin auprès d'un temple de Diane.\r\n\r\n     \"C'est arrivés en cet endroit, au moment de tourner à droite et de\r\n     gagner, en remontant le Vicus-Virbius, le Cispius, où habitait son\r\n     père, que les chevaux s'arrêtèrent; que Tullie, poussée par\r\n     l'impatience fièvreuse de l'ambition, et n'ayant plus que quelques\r\n     pas à faire pour arriver au terme, avertie par le cocher que le\r\n     cadavre de son père était là gisant, s'écria: 'Eh bien, pousse le\r\n     char en avant.'\r\n\r\n     \"Le meurtre s'est accompli au pied du Viminal, à l'extrémité du\r\n     Vicus-Cyprius, là où fut depuis le Vicus-Sceleratus, la rue\r\n     Funeste.\r\n\r\n     \"Le lieu où la tradition plaçait cette tragique aventure ne peut\r\n     être sur l'Esquilin: mais nécessairement au pied de cette colline\r\n     et du Viminal, puisque, parvenu à l'extrémité du Vicus-Cyprius, le\r\n     cocher allait tourner à droite et remonter pour gravir l'Esquilin.\r\n     Il ne faut donc pas chercher, comme Nibby, la rue Scélérate sur une\r\n     des pentes, ou, comme Canina et M.

Rom._ ii. 153.\r\n\r\nTurning to the left, at the foot of the Esquiline, we find the\r\ninteresting _Church of Sta. Pudenziana_, supposed to be the most ancient\r\nof all the Roman churches (\"omnium ecclesiaram urbis vetustissima\").\r\nCardinal Wiseman, who took his title from this church, considers it was\r\nthe principal place of worship in Rome after apostolic times, being\r\nfounded on the site of the house where St. Paul lodged, A.D. 41 to 50,\r\nwith the senator Pudens, whose family were his first converts, and who\r\nis said to have himself suffered martyrdom under Nero. On this ancient\r\nplace of worship an oratory was engrafted by Pius I. (_c._ A.D. 145), in\r\nmemory of the younger daughter of Pudens, Pudenziana, perhaps at the\r\nrequest of her sister Prassede, who is believed to have survived till\r\nthat time. In very early times two small churches existed here, known\r\nas \"Titulus Pudentis\" and \"Titulus Pastoris,\" the latter in memory of a\r\nbrother of Pius I.\r\n\r\nThe church, which has been successively altered by Adrian I. in the\r\neighth century, by Gregory VII., and by Innocent II., was finally\r\nmodernised by Cardinal Caetani in 1597. Little remains of ancient\r\nexternal work except the graceful brick campanile (_c._ 1130) with\r\ntriple arcades of open arches on every side separated by bands of\r\nterra-cotta moulding,--and the door adorned with low reliefs of the Lamb\r\nbearing a cross, and of Sta. Prassede and Sta. Pudenziana with the vases\r\nin which they collected the blood of the martyrs, and two other figures,\r\nprobably St. Pudens and St. Pastor.\r\n\r\nThe chapel on the left of the tribune, which is regarded as the \"Titulus\r\nPudentis,\" has an old mosaic pavement, said to have belonged to the\r\nhouse of Pudens. Here is a bas-relief by Giacomo della Porta,\r\nrepresenting our Saviour delivering the keys to St. Peter; and here is\r\npreserved part of the altar at which St. Peter is said to have\r\ncelebrated mass (the rest is at the Lateran), and which was used by all\r\nthe early popes till the time of Sylvester. Among early Christian\r\ninscriptions let into the walls, is one to a Cornelia, of the family of\r\nthe Pudenziani, with a rude portrait.\r\n\r\nOpening from the left aisle is the chapel of the Caetani family, with\r\ntombs of the seventeenth century. Over the altar is a bas-relief of the\r\nAdoration of the Magi, by _Paolo Olivieri_. On each side are fine\r\ncolumns of Lunachella marble. Over the entrance from the nave are\r\nancient mosaics,--of the Evangelists and of Sta. Pudenziana collecting\r\nthe blood of the martyrs. Beneath, is a gloomy and neglected vault, in\r\nwhich all the sarcophagi and coffins of the dead Caetani are shown by\r\ntorchlight.\r\n\r\nIn the tribune are magnificent mosaics, ascribed by some to the eighth,\r\nby others to the fourth century, and considered by De Rossi,[238] as the\r\nbest of all ancient Christian mosaics.\r\n\r\n     \"In conception and treatment this work is indeed classic: seated on\r\n     a rich throne in the centre, is the Saviour with one arm extended,\r\n     and in the other hand holding a book open at the words,\r\n     _Conservator Ecclesiæ Pudentianæ_; laterally stand SS. Praxedis and\r\n     Pudentiana with leafy crowns in their hands; and at a lower level,\r\n     but more in front, SS. Peter and Paul with eight other male\r\n     figures, all in the amply-flowing costume of ancient Romans; while\r\n     in the background are seen, beyond a portico with arcades, various\r\n     stately buildings, one a rotunda, another a parallelogram with a\r\n     gable-headed front, recognizable as a baptistery and basilica,\r\n     here, we may believe, in authentic copy from the earliest types of\r\n     the period of the first Christian emperors. Above the group, and\r\n     hovering in the air, a large cross, studded with gems, surmounts\r\n     the head of our Saviour, between the four symbols of the\r\n     Evangelists, of which one has been entirely, and another in the\r\n     greater part, sacrificed to some wretched accessories in woodwork\r\n     actually allowed to conceal portions of this most interesting\r\n     mosaic! As to expression, a severe solemnity is that prevailing,\r\n     especially in the principal head, which _alone_ is crowned with the\r\n     nimbus--one among other proofs, if but negative, of its high\r\n     antiquity.\"--_Heman's Ancient Christian Art._\r\n\r\nBesides Sta. Pudenziana and St. Pudens,--St. Novatus and St. Siricius\r\nare said to be buried here. Those who visit this sanctuary every day\r\nobtain an indulgence of 3000 years, with remission of a third part of\r\ntheir sins! Excavations made by Mr. J. H. Parker, in 1865, have laid\r\nbare some interesting constructions beneath the church,--supposed to be\r\nthose of the house of Pudens--a part of the public baths of Novatus, the\r\nson of Pudens, which were in use for some centuries after his time, and\r\na chamber in which is supposed to have been the oratory dedicated by\r\nPius I. in A.D. 145.\r\n\r\n     \"Eubulus greeteth thee, and _Pudens_, and Linus, and Claudia, and\r\n     all the brethren.\"--_2 Timothy_ iv. 21.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the family of Pudens is received as the legacy\r\nof Pastor to the Christian Church.\r\n\r\n     \"Pudens went to his Saviour, leaving his daughters strengthened\r\n     with chastity, and learned in all the divine law. These sold their\r\n     goods, and distributed the produce to the poor, and persevered\r\n     strictly in the love of Christ, guarding intact the flower of their\r\n     virginity, and only seeking for glory in vigils, fastings, and\r\n     prayer. They desired to have a baptistery in their house, to which\r\n     the blessed Pius not only consented, but with his own hand drew the\r\n     plan of the fountain. Then calling in their slaves, both from town\r\n     and country, the two virgins gave liberty to those who were\r\n     Christians, and urged belief in the faith upon those who had not\r\n     yet received it. By the advice of the blessed Pius, the\r\n     affranchisement was declared, with all the ancient usages, in the\r\n     oratory founded by Pudens; then, at the festival of Easter,\r\n     ninety-six neophytes were baptized; so that thenceforth assemblies\r\n     were constantly held in the said oratory, which night and day\r\n     resounded with hymns of praise. Many pagans gladly came thither to\r\n     find the faith and receive baptism.\r\n\r\n     \"Meanwhile the Emperor Antonine, being informed of what was taking\r\n     place, issued an edict commanding all Christians to dwell apart in\r\n     their own houses, without mixing with the rest of the people, and\r\n     that they should neither go to the public shops, nor to the baths.\r\n     Praxedis and Pudentiana then assembled those whom they had led to\r\n     the faith, and housed them. They nourished them for many days,\r\n     watching and praying. The blessed bishop Pius himself frequently\r\n     visited us with joy, and offered the sacrifice for us to the\r\n     Saviour.\r\n\r\n     \"Then Pudentiana went to God. Her sister and I wrapped her in\r\n     perfumes and kept her concealed in the oratory. Then, at the end of\r\n     twenty-eight days, we carried her to the cemetery of Priscilla, and\r\n     laid her near her father Pudens.\r\n\r\n     \"Eleven months after, Novatus died in his turn. He bequeathed his\r\n     goods to Praxedis, and she then begged of St. Pius to erect a\r\n     titular (a church) in the baths of Novatus, which were no longer\r\n     used, and where there was a large and spacious hall. The bishop\r\n     made the dedication in the name of the blessed virgin Praxedis. In\r\n     the same place he consecrated a baptistery.\r\n\r\n     \"But, at the end of two years, a great persecution was declared\r\n     against the Christians, and many of them received the crown of\r\n     martyrdom. Praxedis concealed a great number of them in her\r\n     oratory, and nourished them at once with the food of this world and\r\n     with the word of God. But the Emperor Antonine, having learnt that\r\n     these meetings took place in the oratory of Priscilla, caused it to\r\n     be searched, and many Christians were taken, especially the priest\r\n     Simetrius and twenty-two others. And the blessed Praxedis collected\r\n     their bodies by night, and buried them in the cemetery of\r\n     Priscilla, on the seventh day of the calends of June. Then the\r\n     virgin of the Saviour, worn out with sorrow, only asked for death.\r\n     Her tears and her prayers reached to heaven, and fifty-four days\r\n     after her brethren had suffered, she passed to God. And I, Pastor,\r\n     the priest, have buried her body near that of her father\r\n     Pudens.\"--_From the Narration of Pastor._\r\n\r\nReturning by the main line of streets to the Quattro Fontane, we skirt\r\non the right the wall of the Villa Negroni (see Ch. XI). Beyond this, on\r\nthe left, is the _Church of S. Paolo Primo Eremita_. The strange-looking\r\npalm-tree over the door, with a raven perched upon it and two lions\r\nbelow, commemorates the story of the saint, who, retiring to the desert\r\nat the age of 22, lived there till he was 112, eating nothing but the\r\ndates of his tree for twenty-two years, after which bread was daily\r\nbrought to him by a raven. In his last hours St. Anthony came to visit\r\nhim and was present at his burial, when two lions his companions came to\r\ndig his grave. The sustaining palm-tree and the three animals who loved\r\nS. Paolo are again represented over the altar. Further on the left, we\r\npass the Via S. Vitale, occupying the site of the Vicus Longus,\r\nconsidered by Dyer to have been the longest street in the ancient city.\r\nHere stood the temples of Sylvanus, and of Fever, with that of Pudicitia\r\nPlebeia, founded _c._ B.C. 297, by Virginia the patrician, wife of\r\nVolumnius, when excluded from the patrician temple of Pudicitia in the\r\nForum Boarium, on account of her plebeian marriage. \"At its altar none\r\nbut plebeian matrons of unimpeachable chastity, and who had been married\r\nto only one husband, were allowed to sacrifice.\"[239]\r\n\r\nThe _Church of S. Vitale_ on the Viminal, which now stands here, was\r\nfounded by Innocent I. in A.D. 416. The interior is covered with\r\nfrescoes of martyrdoms. It is seldom open except early on Sunday\r\nmornings. S. Vitale, father of S. Gervasius and S. Protasius, was the\r\nmartyr and patron saint of Ravenna who was buried alive under Nero.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, on the left of the Via delle Quattro Fontane, is the\r\n_Church of S. Dionisio_, belonging to the Basilian nuns, called\r\nApostoline di S. Basilio. It contains an Ecce Homo of _Luca Giordano_,\r\nand the gaudy shrine of the virgin martyr Sta. Coraola.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROME\r\n\r\nShowing the more important streets and buildings.

Maria della Concezione_,\r\ncontains several fine pictures. In the first chapel, on the right, is\r\nthe magnificent _Guido_ of the Archangel Michael trampling upon the\r\nDevil,--said to be a portrait of Pope Innocent X., against whom the\r\npainter had a peculiar spite.\r\n\r\n     \"Here the angel, standing, yet scarcely touching the ground, poised\r\n     on his outspread wings, sets his left foot on the head of his\r\n     adversary; in one hand he brandishes a sword, in the other he holds\r\n     the end of a chain, with which he is about to bind down the demon\r\n     in the bottomless pit. The attitude has been criticised, and\r\n     justly; the grace is somewhat mannered, verging on the theatrical;\r\n     but Forsyth is too severe when he talks of 'the air of a dancing\r\n     master': one thing, however, is certain, we do not think about the\r\n     attitude when we look at Raphael's St. Michael (in the Louvre); in\r\n     Guido's it is the first thing that strikes us; but when we look\r\n     farther, the head redeems all; it is singularly beautiful, and in\r\n     the blending of the masculine and feminine graces, in the serene\r\n     purity of the brow, and the flow of the golden hair, there is\r\n     something divine; a slight, very slight expression of scorn is in\r\n     the air of the head. The fiend is the worst part of the picture; it\r\n     is not a fiend, but a degraded prosaic human ruffian; we laugh with\r\n     incredulous contempt at the idea of an angel called down from\r\n     heaven to overcome such a wretch. In Raphael the fiend is human,\r\n     but the head has the god-like ugliness and malignity of a satyr;\r\n     Guido's fiend is only stupid and base. It appears to me that there\r\n     is just the same difference--the same _kind_ of difference--between\r\n     the angel of Raphael and the angel of Guido, as between the\r\n     description in Tasso and the description in Milton; let any one\r\n     compare them. In Tasso we are struck by the picturesque elegance of\r\n     the description as a piece of art, the melody of the verse, the\r\n     admirable choice of the expressions, as in Guido by the finished\r\n     but somewhat artificial and studied grace. In Raphael and Milton we\r\n     see only the vision of a 'shape divine.'\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_,\r\n     p. 107.\r\n\r\nIn the same chapel is a picture by _Gherardo della Notte_ of Christ in\r\nthe purple robe. The third chapel contains a fresco by _Domenichino_ of\r\nthe Death of St Francis, and a picture of the Ecstasy of St. Francis,\r\nwhich was a gift from the same painter to this church.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel on the left contains The Visit of Ananias to Saul, by\r\n_Pietro da Cortona_.\r\n\r\n     \"Whoever would know to what length this painter carried his style\r\n     in his altar-piece should examine the Conversion of St. Paul in the\r\n     Cappuccini at Rome, which though placed opposite to the St. Michael\r\n     of Guido, cannot fail to excite the admiration of such judges as\r\n     are willing to admit various styles of beauty in art.\"--_Lanzi._\r\n\r\nOn the left of the high-altar is the tomb of Prince Alexander Sobieski,\r\nson of John III., king of Poland, who died at Rome in 1714.\r\n\r\nThe church was founded in 1624, by Cardinal Barberini, the old\r\nmonk-brother of Urban VIII., who, while his nephews were employed in\r\nbuilding magnificent palaces, refused to take advantage of the family\r\nelevation otherwise than to endow this church and convent. He is buried\r\nin front of the altar, with the remarkable epitaph--very different to\r\nthe pompous, self-glorifying inscriptions of his brother--\r\n\r\n    \"Hic jacet pulvis, cinis, et nihil.\"\r\n\r\nThis Cardinal Barberini possesses some historical interest from the\r\npatronage he extended to Milton during his visit to Rome in 1638.\r\n\r\n     \"During his sojourn in Rome Milton enjoyed the conversation of\r\n     several learned and ingenious men, and particularly of Lucas\r\n     Holsteinius, keeper of the Vatican library, who received him with\r\n     the greatest humanity, and showed him all the Greek authors,\r\n     whether in print or MS.--which had passed through his correction;\r\n     and also presented him to Cardinal Barberini, who, at an\r\n     entertainment of music, performed at his own expense, waited for\r\n     him at the door, and taking him by the hand, brought him into the\r\n     assembly. The next morning he waited upon the Cardinal to return\r\n     him thanks for these civilities, and by the means of Holsteinius\r\n     was again introduced to his Eminence, and spent some time in\r\n     conversation with him.\"--_Newton's Life of Milton._[240]\r\n\r\nOver the entrance is a cartoon (with some differences) for the Navicella\r\nof Giotto.\r\n\r\nFrom this church is entered the famous cemetery of the Cappuccini (not\r\nsubterranean), consisting of four chambers, ornamented with human bones\r\nin patterns, and with mummified bodies. The earth was brought from\r\nJerusalem. As the cemetery was too small for the convent, when any monk\r\ndied, the one who had been buried longest was ejected to make room for\r\nhim. The loss of a grave was supposed to be amply compensated by the\r\nshort rest in the holy earth which the body had already enjoyed. It is\r\npleasant to read on the spot the pretty sketch in the \"Improvisatore.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I was playing near the church of the Capuchins, with some other\r\n     children who were all younger than myself. There was fastened on\r\n     the church door a little cross of metal; it was fastened about the\r\n     middle of the door, and I could just reach it with my hand. Always\r\n     when our mothers had passed by with us they had lifted us up that\r\n     we might kiss the holy sign. One day, when we children were\r\n     playing, one of the youngest of them inquired, 'why the child Jesus\r\n     did not come down and play with us?' I assumed an air of wisdom,\r\n     and replied that he was really bound upon the cross. We went to the\r\n     church door, and although we found no one, we wished, as our\r\n     mothers had taught us, to kiss him, but we could not reach up to\r\n     it; one therefore lifted up the other, but just as the lips were\r\n     pointed for the kiss, that one who lifted the other lost his\r\n     strength, and the kissing one fell down just when his lips were\r\n     about to touch the invisible child Jesus. At that moment my mother\r\n     came by, and when she saw our child's play, she folded her hands,\r\n     and said, 'You are actually some of God's angels, and thou art mine\r\n     own angel,' added she, and kissed me.\r\n\r\n     \"The Capuchin monk, Fra Martino, was my mother's confessor. He made\r\n     very much of me, and gave me a picture of the Virgin, weeping great\r\n     tears, which fell, like rain-drops, down into the burning flames of\r\n     hell, where the damned caught this draught of refreshment. He took\r\n     me over with him into the convent, where the open colonnade, which\r\n     enclosed in a square the little potato-garden, with the two cypress\r\n     and orange-trees, made a very deep impression upon me. Side by\r\n     side, in the open passages, hung old portraits of deceased monks,\r\n     and on the door of each cell were pasted pictures from the history\r\n     of the martyrs, which I contemplated with the same holy emotions as\r\n     afterwards the masterpieces of Raphael and Andrea del Sarto.\r\n\r\n     \"'Thou art really a bright youth,' said he; 'thou shall now see the\r\n     dead.' Upon this, he opened a little door of a gallery which lay a\r\n     few steps below the colonnade. We descended, and now I saw round\r\n     about me skulls upon skulls, so placed one upon another, that they\r\n     formed walls, and therewith several chapels. In these were regular\r\n     niches, in which were seated perfect skeletons of the most\r\n     distinguished of the monks, enveloped in their brown cowls, their\r\n     cords round their waists, and with a breviary or withered bunch of\r\n     flowers in their hands. Altars, chandeliers, bas-reliefs, of human\r\n     joints, horrible and tasteless as the whole idea. I clung fast to\r\n     the monk, who whispered a prayer, and then said to me, 'Here also I\r\n     shall some time sleep; wilt thou thus visit me?'\r\n\r\n     \"I answered not a word, but looked horrified at him, and then round\r\n     about me upon the strange grizzly assembly. It was foolish to take\r\n     me, a child, into this place. I was singularly impressed with the\r\n     whole thing, and did not feel myself easy again until I came into\r\n     his little cell, where the beautiful yellow oranges almost hung in\r\n     at the window, and I saw the brightly coloured picture of the\r\n     Madonna, who was borne upwards by angels into the clear sunshine,\r\n     while a thousand flowers filled the grave in which she had\r\n     rested.....\r\n\r\n     \"On the festival of All-Saints I was down in the chapel of the\r\n     dead, where Fra Martino took me when I first visited the convent.\r\n     All the monks sang masses for the dead, and I, with two other boys\r\n     of my own age, swung the incense-breathing censer before the great\r\n     altar of skulls. They had placed lights in the chandeliers made of\r\n     bones, new garlands were placed around the brows of the skeleton\r\n     monks, and fresh bouquets in their hands. Many people, as usual,\r\n     thronged in; they all knelt and the singers intoned the solemn\r\n     Miserere. I gazed for a long time on the pale yellow skulls, and\r\n     the fumes of the incense which wavered in strange shapes between me\r\n     and them, and everything began to swim round before my eyes; it was\r\n     as if I saw everything through a large rainbow; as if a thousand\r\n     prayer-bells rung in my ear; it seemed as if I was borne along a\r\n     stream; it was unspeakably delicious--more, I know not;\r\n     consciousness left me,--I was in a swoon.\"--_Hans Ch. Andersen._\r\n\r\nThe street behind the Piazza Cappuccini leads to the _Church of S.\r\nIsidoro_,[241] built 1622, for Irish Franciscan monks. The altar-piece,\r\nrepresenting S. Isidore, is by _Andrea Sacchi_. This church contains\r\nseveral tombs of distinguished Irishmen who have died in Rome.\r\n\r\nOpposite are the recently founded convent and small chapel of the\r\n_Pregatrici_--nuns most picturesquely attired in blue and white, and\r\ndevoted to the perpetual adoration of the Sacrament, who sing during the\r\nBenediction service, like the nuns of the Trinità di Monti.\r\n\r\nThe _Via S. Niccolo in Tolentino_ leads by the handsome Church of that\r\nname, from the Piazza Barberini to the railway station. In this street\r\nare the hotels \"Costanzi\" and \"Del Globo.\"\r\n\r\nParallel with, and behind this, the _Via S. Basilio_ runs up the\r\nhill-side. At the top of this street is the entrance of the _Villa\r\nMassimo Rignano_, containing some fine palm-trees. This site, with the\r\nridge of the opposite hill, and the valley between, was once occupied by\r\nthe _Gardens of Sallust_ (Horti Pretiosissimi), purchased for the\r\nemperors after the death of the historian, and a favourite residence of\r\nVespasian, Nerva, and especially of Aurelian. Some vaulted halls under\r\nthe cliff of the opposite hill, and a circular ruin surrounded by\r\nniches, are the only remains of the many fine buildings which once\r\nexisted here, and which comprised a palace, baths, and the portico\r\ncalled Milliarensis, 1000 feet long. These edifices are known to have\r\nbeen ruined when Rome was taken by the Goths under Alaric (410), who\r\nentered at the neighbouring Porta Salara. The obelisk now in front of\r\nthe Trinità di Monti, was removed from hence by Pius VI. The picturesque\r\nold casino of the Barberini, which occupied the most prominent position\r\nin the gardens, was pulled down in 1869, to make way for a house\r\nbelonging to Spithover the librarian. The hill-side is supported by long\r\npicturesque buttresses, beneath which are remains of the huge masonry of\r\nServius Tullius, whose _Agger_ may be traced on the ridge of the hill\r\nrunning towards the present railway station. Part of these grounds are\r\nsupposed to have formed the Campus Sceleratus, where the vestal virgins\r\nsuffered who had broken their vows of chastity.\r\n\r\n     \"When condemned by the college of pontifices, the vestal was\r\n     stripped of her vittæ and other badges of office, was scourged, was\r\n     attired like a corpse, placed in a close litter, and borne through\r\n     the forum, attended by her weeping kindred with all the ceremonies\r\n     of a real funeral, to the Campus Sceleratus, within the city walls,\r\n     close to the Colline gate. There a small vault underground had been\r\n     previously prepared, containing a couch, a lamp, and a table with a\r\n     little food. The Pontifex Maximus, having lifted up his hands to\r\n     heaven and uttered a secret prayer, opened the litter, led forth\r\n     the culprit, and placing her on the steps of the ladder which gave\r\n     access to the subterranean cell, delivered her over to the common\r\n     executioner and his assistants, who conducted her down, drew up the\r\n     ladder, and having filled the pit with earth until the surface was\r\n     level with the surrounding ground, left her to perish deprived of\r\n     all the tributes of respect usually paid to the spirits of the\r\n     departed. In every case the paramour was publicly scourged to death\r\n     in the forum.\"--_Smith's Dict. of Antiquities._\r\n\r\n     \"A Vignaiuolo showed us in the Gardens of Sallust a hole, through\r\n     which he said those vestal virgins were put who had violated their\r\n     vows of chastity. While we were listening to their story, some\r\n     pretty Contadini came up to us attended by their rustic swains, and\r\n     after looking into the hole, pitied the vestal\r\n     virgins--'_Poverine_,' shrugged their shoulders, and laughing,\r\n     thanked their stars and the Madonna, that poor Fanciulle were not\r\n     buried alive for such things now-a-days.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nA turn in the road now leads to the gate of the beautiful _Villa\r\nLudovisi_, to which it has been very difficult to obtain admittance\r\nsince the Sardinian occupation. The excellent proprietors, the Duke and\r\nDuchess Sora, have lived at Foligno in complete seclusion, since the\r\nchange of government.\r\n\r\nThe villa was built early in the last century by Cardinal Ludovisi,\r\nnephew of Gregory XV., from whom it descended to the Prince of Piombino,\r\nfather of Duke Sora. The grounds, which are of an extent extraordinary\r\nwhen considered as being within the walls of a capital, were laid out by\r\nLe Nôtre, and are in the stiff French style of high clipped hedges, and\r\navenues adorned with vases and sarcophagi. Near the entrance is a pretty\r\nfountain shaded by a huge plane-tree; the Quirinal is seen in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the entrance is the principal casino of sculptures, a\r\nvery beautiful collection (catalogues on the spot). Especially\r\nremarkable are,--the grand colossal head, known as the \"Ludovisi Juno\"\r\n(41);\r\n\r\n     \"A Rome, une Junon surpasse toutes les autres par son aspect et\r\n     rappelle la Junon de Polyclète par sa majesté: c'est la célèbre\r\n     Junon Ludovisi que Goethe admirait tant, et devant laquelle dans un\r\n     accès de dévotion païenne,--seul genre de dévotion qu'il ait connu\r\n     à Rome,--il faisait, nous dit-il, sa prière du matin.\r\n\r\n     \"Cette tête colossale de Junon offre bien les caractères de la\r\n     sculpture de Polyclète; la gravité, la grandeur, la dignité; mais\r\n     ainsi que dans d'autres Junons qu'on peut supposer avoir été\r\n     sculptées à Rome, l'imitateur de Polyclète, on doit le croire,\r\n     adoucit la sévérité, je dirai presque la dureté de l'original,\r\n     telle qu'elle se montre sur les médailles d'Argos, et celles\r\n     d'Elis.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Romaine_, iii. 264.\r\n\r\n     \"No words can give a true impression of the colossal head of Juno\r\n     in the Villa Ludovisi: it is like a song of Homer.\"--_Goethe._\r\n\r\n--the _Statue of Mars_ seated (I), with a Cupid at his feet, found in\r\nthe portico of Octavia, and restored by Bernini;\r\n\r\n     \"II y avait bien un Mars assis de Scopas, et ce Mars était à Rome;\r\n     mais un dieu dans son temple devait être assis sur un trône et non\r\n     sur un rocher, comme le prétendu Mars Ludovisi. On a donc eu\r\n     raison, selon moi, de reconnaître dans cette belle statue un\r\n     Achille, à l'expression pensive de son visage, et surtout à\r\n     l'attitude caractéristique que le sculpteur lui a donnée, lui\r\n     faisant embrasser son genou avec ses deux mains, attitude qui, dans\r\n     le langage de la sculpture antique, était le signe d'une méditation\r\n     douloureuse. On citait comme très-beau un Achille de Silanion,\r\n     sculpteur grec habile à rendre les sentiments violents. D'après\r\n     cela, son Achille pouvait être un Achille indigné; c'est de lui que\r\n     viendrait l'Achille de la villa Ludovisi. L'expression de dépit,\r\n     plus énergique dans l'original, eût été adoucie dans une admirable\r\n     copie.'--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 437.\r\n\r\n--and No. 28;\r\n\r\n     \"Le beau groupe auquel on avait donné le nom d'Arria et Pætus; il\r\n     fallait fermer les yeux à l'évidence pour voir un Romain du temps\r\n     de Claude dans ce chef barbare qui, après avoir tué sa femme, se\r\n     frappe lui-même d'un coup mortel. Le type du visage, la chevelure,\r\n     le caractère de l'action, tout est gaulois; la manière même dont\r\n     s'accomplit l'immolation volontaire montre que ce n'est pas un\r\n     Romain que nous avons devant les yeux; un Romain se tuait plus\r\n     simplement, avec moins de fracas. Le principal personnage du groupe\r\n     Ludovisi conserve en ce moment suprême quelque chose de triomphant\r\n     et de théâtral; soulevant d'une main sa femme affaissée sous le\r\n     coup qu'il lui a porté, de l'autre il enfonce son épée dans sa\r\n     poitrine. La tête haute, l'œil tourné vers le ciel, il semble\r\n     répéter le mot de sa race: 'Je ne crains qu'une chose, c'est que le\r\n     ciel tombe sur ma tête.'\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 207.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the gardens, to the left, is another casino, from whose\r\nroof a most beautiful view may be obtained. Here are the most famous\r\nfrescoes of _Guercino_. On the ceiling of the ground-floor, Aurora\r\ndriving away Night and scattering flowers in her course, with Evening\r\nand Daybreak in the lunettes; and, on the first floor, \"Fame\" attended\r\nby Force and Virtue. Smaller rooms on the ground floor have landscapes\r\nby _Guercino_ and _Domenichino_, and some groups of Cupids by _T.\r\nZucchero_; on the staircase is a fine bas-relief of two Cupids dragging\r\na quiver.\r\n\r\n     \"The prophets and sibyls of Guercino da Cento (1590--1666), and his\r\n     Aurora, in a garden pavilion of the Villa Ludovisi, at Rome, almost\r\n     attain to the effect of oil paintings in their glowing colouring\r\n     combined with the broad and dark masses of shadow.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     \"In allegorising nature, Guercino imitates the deep shades of\r\n     night, the twilight grey, and the irradiations of morning, with all\r\n     the magic of _chiaroscuro_; but his figures are too mortal for the\r\n     region where they move.\"--_Forsyth._\r\n\r\nIn B.C. 82, the district near the Porta Collina, now occupied by the\r\nVilla Ludovisi, was the scene of a great battle for the very existence\r\nof Rome, between Sylla, and the Samnites and Lucanians under the Samnite\r\ngeneral Pontius Telesinus, who declared he would raze the city to the\r\nground if he were victorious. The left wing under Sylla was put to\r\nflight; but the right wing, commanded by Crassus, enabled him to restore\r\nthe battle, and to gain a complete victory; fifty thousand men fell on\r\neach side.\r\n\r\nThe road now runs along the ridge of the hill to the Porta Salara, by\r\nwhich Alaric entered Rome through the treachery of the Isaurian guard,\r\non the 24th of August, 410.\r\n\r\nPassing through the gate and turning to the right along the outside of\r\nthe wall, we may see, against the grounds of the Villa Ludovisi, the two\r\nround towers of the now closed _Porta Pinciana_, restored by Belisarius.\r\nThis is the place where tradition declares that in his declining years\r\nthe great general sat begging, with the cry, \"Date obolum Belisario.\"\r\n\r\n     \"A côté de la Porta Pinciana, on lit sur une pierre les paroles\r\n     célèbres: 'Donnez une obole à Bélisaire'; mais cette inscription\r\n     est moderne, comme la légende à laquelle elle fait allusion, et\r\n     qu'on ne trouve dans nul historien contemporain de Bélisaire.\r\n     Bélisaire ne demanda jamais l'aumône, et si le cicerone montre\r\n     encore aux voyageurs l'endroit où, vieux et aveugle, il implorait\r\n     une obole de la charité des passants, c'est que près de ce lieu il\r\n     avait, sur la colline du Pincio, son palais, situé entre les\r\n     jardins de Lucullus et les jardins de Salluste, et digne\r\n     probablement de ce double voisinage par sa magnificence. Ce qui est\r\n     vrai, c'est que le vainqueur des Goths et des Vandales fut\r\n     disgracié par Justinien, grâce aux intrigues de Théodora. La\r\n     légende, comme presque toujours, a exprimé par une fable une\r\n     vérité, l'ingratitude si fréquente des souverains envers ceux qui\r\n     leur ont rendu lus plus grands services.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 396.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA short distance from the gate, along the Via Salara, is, on the right,\r\nthe _Villa Albani_ (shown on Tuesdays by an order), built in 1760 by\r\nCardinal Alessandro Albani,--sold in 1834 to the Count of Castelbarco,\r\nand in 1868 to Prince Torlonia, its present possessor. The scene from\r\nits garden terrace is among the loveliest of Roman pictures, the view of\r\nthe delicate Sabine mountains--Monte Gennaro, with the Montecelli\r\nbeneath it--and in the middle distance, the churches of Sant' Agnese and\r\nSta. Costanza, relieved by dark cypresses and a graceful fountain.\r\n\r\nThe _Casino_, which is, in fact, a magnificent palace, is remarkable as\r\nhaving been built from Cardinal Albani's own designs, Carlo Marchionni\r\nhaving been only employed to see that they were carried out.\r\n\r\n     \"Here is a villa of exquisite design, planned by a profound\r\n     antiquary. Here Cardinal Albani, having spent his life in\r\n     collecting ancient sculpture, formed such porticoes and such\r\n     saloons to receive it as an old Roman would have done: porticoes\r\n     where the statues stood free upon the pavement between columns\r\n     proportioned to their stature; saloons which were not stocked but\r\n     embellished with families of allied statues, and seemed full\r\n     without a crowd. Here Winckelmann grew into an antiquary under the\r\n     cardinal's patronage and instruction; and here he projected his\r\n     history of art, which brings this collection continually into\r\n     view.\"--_Forsyth's Italy._\r\n\r\nThe collection of sculptures is much reduced since the French invasion,\r\nwhen 294 of the finest specimens were carried off by Napoleon to Paris,\r\nwhere they were sold by Prince Albani upon their restoration in 1815, as\r\nhe was unwilling to bear the expense of transport. The greater\r\nproportion of the remaining statues are of no great importance. Those of\r\nthe imperial family in the vestibule are interesting--those of Julius\r\nand Augustus Cæsar, of Agrippina wife of Germanicus, and of Faustina,\r\nare seated; most of the heads have been restored.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the treasures of this villa, are the sarcophagus with\r\nreliefs of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, pronounced by Winckelmann\r\nto be one of the finest in existence; a head of Æsop, supposed to be\r\nafter Lysippus; and the bronze \"Apollo Sauroctonos,\" considered by\r\nWinckelmann to be the original statue by Praxiteles described by Pliny,\r\nand the most beautiful bronze statue in the world,--it was found on the\r\nAventine. But most important of all is the famous relievo of Antinous\r\ncrowned with lotus, from the Villa Adriana (over the chimney-piece of\r\nthe first room to the right of the saloon), supposed to have formed part\r\nof an apotheosis of Antinous:\r\n\r\n     \"As fresh, and as highly finished, as if it had just left the\r\n     studio of the sculptor, this work, after the Apollo and the\r\n     Laocoon, is perhaps the most beautiful monument of antiquity which\r\n     time has transmitted to us.\"--_Winckelmann, Hist. de l'Art_, vi.\r\n     ch. 7.\r\n\r\nInferior only to this, is another bas-relief, also over a\r\nchimney-piece,--the parting of Orpheus and Eurydice.\r\n\r\n     \"Les deux époux vont se quitter. Eurydice attache sur Orphée un\r\n     profond regard d'adieu. Sa main est posée sur l'épaule de son\r\n     époux, geste ordinaire dans les groupes qui expriment la séparation\r\n     de ceux qui s'aiment. La main d'Orphée dégage doucement celle\r\n     d'Eurydice, tandis que Mercure fait de la sienne un léger mouvement\r\n     pour l'entraîner. Dans ce léger mouvement est tout leur sort;\r\n     l'effet le plus pathétique est produit par la composition la plus\r\n     simple; l'émotion la plus pénétrante s'exhale de la sculpture la\r\n     plus tranquille.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 256.\r\n\r\nThe villa also contains a collection of pictures, of which the most\r\ninteresting are the sketches of _Giulio Romano_ for the frescoes of the\r\nstory of Psyche in the Palazzo del Te at Mantua, and two fine pictures\r\nby Luca Signorelli and Perugino, in compartments, in the first room on\r\nthe left of the saloon. All the works of art have lately been\r\nrearranged. The _Caffè_ and the _Bigliardo_--(reached by an avenue of\r\noaks, which, being filled with ancient tombstones, has the effect of a\r\ncemetery)--contain more statues, but of less importance.\r\n\r\nBeyond the villa, the Via Salara (said by Pliny to derive its name from\r\nthe salt of Ostia exported to the north by this route) passes on the\r\nleft the site of Antemnæ, and crosses the Anio two miles from the city,\r\nby the _Ponte Salara_, destroyed by the Roman government in the terror\r\nof Garibaldi's approach from Monte Rotondo, in 1867. This bridge was a\r\nrestoration by Narses, in the sixth century, but stood on the\r\nfoundations of that famous Ponte Salara, upon which Titus Manlius fought\r\nthe Gaulish giant, and cutting off his head, carried off the golden\r\ncollar which earned him the name of Torquatus.\r\n\r\n     \"Manlius prend un bouclier léger de fantassin, une épée espagnole\r\n     commode pour combattre de très-près, et s'avance à la rencontre du\r\n     Barbare. Les deux champions, isolés sur le pont, comme sur un\r\n     théâtre, se joignent au milieu. Le Barbare portait un vêtement\r\n     bariolé et une armure ornée de dessins et d'incrustations dorées,\r\n     conforme au caractère de sa race, aussi vaine que vaillante. Les\r\n     armes du Romain étaient bonnes, mais sans éclat. Point chez lui,\r\n     comme chez son adversaire, de chant, de transports, d'armes agitées\r\n     avec fureur, mais un cœur plein de courage et d'une colère\r\n     muette qu'il réservait tout entière pour le combat.\r\n\r\n     \"Le Gaulois, qui dépassait son adversaire de toute la tête, met en\r\n     avant son bouclier et fait tomber pesamment son glaive sur l'armure\r\n     de son adversaire. Celui-ci le heurte deux fois de son bouclier, le\r\n     force à reculer, le trouble, et se glissant alors entre le bouclier\r\n     et le corps du Gaulois, de deux coups rapidement portés lui ouvre\r\n     le ventre. Quand le grand corps est tombé, Manlius lui coupe la\r\n     tête, et, ramassant le collier de son ennemi décapité, jette tout\r\n     sanglant sur son cou ce collier, le _torques_, propre aux Gaulois,\r\n     et qu'on peut voir au Capitole porté par celui qu'on appelle à tort\r\n     le gladiateur mourant. Un soldat donne, en plaisantant, à Manlius\r\n     le sobriquet de _Torquatus_, que sa famille a toujours été fière de\r\n     porter.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 10.\r\n\r\nBeyond the ruins of the bridge, is a huge tomb with a tower, now used as\r\nan Osteria. Hence, the road leads by the Villa of Phaon (Villa Spada)\r\nwhere Nero died, and the site of Fidenæ, now known as Castel Giubeleo,\r\nto Monte Rotondo.\r\n\r\nThe district beyond the Porta Salara, and that extending between the Via\r\nSalara and the Monte Parioli, are completely undermined by catacombs\r\n(see Ch. IX.). The most important are--1. Nearest the gate, the\r\n_Catacomb of St. Felicitas_, which had three tiers of galleries, adorned\r\nby Pope Boniface I., who took refuge there from persecution,--now much\r\ndilapidated. Over this cemetery was a church, now destroyed, which is\r\nmentioned by William of Malmesbury. 2. _The Catacomb of SS. Thraso and\r\nSaturninus_, much decorated with the usual paintings. 3. _The Catacomb\r\nof Sta. Priscilla_, near the descent to the Anio. This cemetery is of\r\ngreat interest, from the number of martyrs' graves it contains, and from\r\nits peculiar construction in an ancient _arenarium_, pillars and walls\r\nof masonry being added throughout the central part, in order to sustain\r\nthe tufa walls. Here were buried--probably because the entrance to the\r\nChapel of the Popes at St. Calixtus was blocked up to preserve it in the\r\npersecution under Diocletian--Pope St. Marcellinus (ob. 308), and Pope\r\nSt. Marcellus (ob. 310), who was sent into exile by Maxentius. On the\r\ntomb of the latter was placed, in finely cut type, the following epitaph\r\nby Pope Damasus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Veredicus Rector, lapsos quia crimina flere\r\n    Prædixit, miseris fuit omnibus hostis amarus.\r\n    Hinc furor, hinc odium sequitur, discordia, lites,\r\n    Seditio, cædes, solvuntur fœdera pacis.\r\n    Crimen ob alterius Christum qui in pace negavit,\r\n    Finibus expulsus patriæ est feritate tyranni.\r\n    Hæc breviter Damasus voluit comperta referre,\r\n    Marcelli ut populus meritum cognoscere posset.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The truth-speaking pope, because he preached that the lapsed\r\n     should weep for their crimes, was bitterly hated by all those\r\n     unhappy ones. Hence followed fury, hatred, discord, contentions,\r\n     sedition, and slaughter, and the bonds of peace were ruptured. For\r\n     the crime of another, who in (a time of) peace had denied Christ,\r\n     (the pontiff) was expelled the shores of his country by the cruelty\r\n     of the tyrant. These things Damasus having learnt, was desirous to\r\n     narrate briefly, that people might recognise the merit of\r\n     Marcellus.\"[242]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the paintings in this catacomb are remarkable; especially\r\nthat of a woman with a child, claimed by the Roman Church as one of the\r\nearliest representations of the Virgin. The painting is thus described\r\nby Northcote:--\r\n\r\n     \"De Rossi unhesitatingly says that he believes this painting of our\r\n     Blessed Lady to belong almost to the apostolic age. It is to be\r\n     seen on the vaulted roof of a _loculus_, and represents the Blessed\r\n     Virgin seated, her head partially covered by a short light veil,\r\n     and with the Holy Child in her arms; opposite to her stands a man,\r\n     clothed in the pallium, holding a volume in one hand, and with the\r\n     other pointing to a star which appears above and between the\r\n     figures. This star almost always accompanies our Blessed Lady, both\r\n     in paintings and in sculptures, where there is an obvious\r\n     historical excuse for it, _e. g._, when she is represented with the\r\n     Magi offering their gifts, or by the side of the manger with the ox\r\n     and the ass; but with a single figure, as in the present instance,\r\n     it is unusual. The most obvious conjecture would be that the figure\r\n     was meant for St. Joseph, or for one of the Magi. De Rossi,\r\n     however, gives many reasons for preferring the prophet Isaias,\r\n     whose prophecies concerning the Messias abound with imagery\r\n     borrowed from light.\"--_Roma Sotterranea._\r\n\r\nThis catacomb is one of the oldest, Sta. Priscilla, from whom it is\r\nnamed, being supposed to have been the mother of Pudens, and a\r\ncontemporary of the apostles. Her granddaughters, Prassede and\r\nPudenziana, were buried here before the removal of their relics to the\r\nchurch on the Esquiline. With this cemetery is connected the\r\nextraordinary history of the manufacture of Sta. Filomena, now one of\r\nthe most popular saints in Italy, and one towards whom idolatry is\r\ncarried out with frantic enthusiasm both at Domo d'Ossola and in some of\r\nthe Neapolitan States. The story of this saint is best told in the words\r\nof Mrs. Jameson.\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1802, while some excavations were going forward in the\r\n     catacomb of Priscilla, a sepulchre was discovered containing the\r\n     skeleton of a young female; on the exterior were rudely painted\r\n     some of the symbols constantly recurring in these chambers of the\r\n     dead; an anchor, an olive branch (emblems of Hope and Peace), a\r\n     scourge, two arrows, and a javelin: above them the following\r\n     inscription, of which the beginning and end were destroyed:--\r\n\r\n    ----LUMENA PAX TE CUM FI----\r\n\r\n     \"The remains, reasonably supposed to be those of one of the early\r\n     martyrs for the faith, were sealed up and deposited in the treasury\r\n     of relics in the Lateran; here they remained for some years\r\n     unthought of. On the return of Pius VII. from France, a Neapolitan\r\n     prelate was sent to congratulate him. One of the priests in his\r\n     train, who wished to create a sensation in his district, where the\r\n     long residence of the French had probably caused some decay of\r\n     piety, begged for a few relics to carry home, and these recently\r\n     discovered remains were bestowed on him; the inscription was\r\n     translated somewhat freely, to signify _Santa Philumena, rest in\r\n     peace_. Another priest, whose name is suppressed _because of his\r\n     great humility_, was favoured by a vision in the broad noon-day, in\r\n     which he beheld the glorious virgin Filomena, who was pleased to\r\n     reveal to him that she had suffered death for preferring the\r\n     Christian faith and her vow of chastity to the addresses of the\r\n     emperor, who wished to make her his wife. This vision leaving much\r\n     of her history obscure, a certain young artist, whose name is also\r\n     suppressed, perhaps because of his great humility, was informed in\r\n     a vision that the emperor alluded to was Diocletian, and at the\r\n     same time the torments and persecutions suffered by the Christian\r\n     virgin Filomena, as well as her wonderful constancy, were also\r\n     revealed to him. There were some difficulties in the way of the\r\n     Emperor Diocletian, which _incline_ the writer of the _historical_\r\n     account to incline to the opinion that the young artist in his\r\n     wisdom _may_ have made a mistake, and that the emperor may have\r\n     been not Diocletian but Maximian. The facts, however, now admitted\r\n     of no doubt; the relics were carried by the priest Francesco da\r\n     Lucia to Naples; they were enclosed in a case of wood resembling in\r\n     form the human body; this figure was habited in a petticoat of\r\n     white satin, and over it a crimson tunic after the Greek fashion;\r\n     the face was painted to represent nature, a garland of flowers was\r\n     placed on the head, and in the hands a lily and a javelin with the\r\n     point reversed to express her purity and her martyrdom; then she\r\n     was laid in a half-sitting posture in a sarcophagus, of which the\r\n     sides were glass, and, after lying for some time in state in the\r\n     chapel of the Torres family in the Church of Sant' Angiolo, she was\r\n     carried in grand procession to Mugnano, a little town about twenty\r\n     miles from Naples, amid the acclamations of the people, working\r\n     many and surprising miracles by the way.... Such is the legend of\r\n     Sta. Filomena, and such the authority on which she has become\r\n     within the last twenty years one of the most popular saints in\r\n     Italy.\"--_Sacred and Legendary Art_, p. 671.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that very interesting relics may still be discovered in this\r\nCatacomb.\r\n\r\n     \"In an account preserved by St. Gregory of Tours, we are told that\r\n     under Numerianus, the martyrs Chrysanthus and Daria were put to\r\n     death in an _arenaria_, and that a great number of the faithful\r\n     having been seen entering a subterranean crypt on the Via Salara,\r\n     to visit their tombs, the heathen emperor caused the entrance to be\r\n     hastily built up, and a vast mound of sand and stone to be heaped\r\n     in front of it, so that they might be all buried alive, even as the\r\n     martyrs whom they had come to venerate. St. Gregory adds, that when\r\n     the tombs of these martyrs were re-discovered, after the ages of\r\n     persecution had ceased, there were found with them, not only the\r\n     relics of those worshippers who had been thus cruelly put to death,\r\n     skeletons of men, women, and children lying on the floor, but also\r\n     the silver cruets (_urcei argentei_) which they had taken down with\r\n     them for the celebration of the sacred mysteries. St. Damasus was\r\n     unwilling to destroy so touching a memorial of past ages. He\r\n     abstained from making any of those changes by which he usually\r\n     decorated the martyrs' tombs, but contented himself with setting up\r\n     one of his invaluable historical inscriptions, and opening a window\r\n     in the adjacent wall or rock, that all might see, without\r\n     disturbing, this monument so unique in its kind--this Christian\r\n     Pompeii in miniature. These things might still be seen in St.\r\n     Gregory's time, in the sixth century; and De Rossi holds out hopes\r\n     that some traces of them may be restored even to our own\r\n     generation, some fragments of the inscription perhaps, or even the\r\n     window itself through which our ancestors once saw so moving a\r\n     spectacle, assisting, as it were, at a mass celebrated in the third\r\n     century.\"--_Roma Sotterranea_, p. 88.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning to the Porta Salara, and following the walls, we reach the\r\n_Porta Pia_, built, as it is now seen, by Pius IX.--very ugly, but\r\nappropriately decorated with statues of St. Agnes and St. Alexander, to\r\nwhose shrines it leads. The statues lost their heads in the capture of\r\nRome in 1870 by the Italian troops, who entered the city by a breach in\r\nthe walls close to this. A little to the right was the _Porta\r\nNomentana_, flanked by round towers, closed by Pius IV. It was by this\r\ngate that the oppressed Roman people retreated to the Mons Sacer--and\r\nthat Nero fled.\r\n\r\n     \"Suivons-le du Grand-Cirque à la porte Nomentane. Quel spectacle!\r\n     Néron, accoutumé à toutes les recherches de la volupté, s'avance à\r\n     cheval, les pieds nus, en chemise, couvert d'un vieux manteau dont\r\n     la couleur était passée, un mouchoir sur le visage. Quatre\r\n     personnes seulement l'accompagnent; parmi elles est ce Sporus, que\r\n     dans un jour d'indicible folie il avait publiquement épousé. Il\r\n     sent la terre trembler, il voit les éclairs au ciel: Néron a peur.\r\n     Tous ceux qu'il a fait mourir lui apparaissent et semblent se\r\n     précipiter sur lui. Nous voici à la porte Nomentane, qui touche au\r\n     Camp des Prétoriens. Néron reconnaît ce lieu où, il y a quinze ans,\r\n     suivant alors le chemin qu'il vient de suivre, il est venu se faire\r\n     reconnaître empereur par les prétoriens. En passant sous les murs\r\n     de leur camp, vers lequel son destin le ramène, il les entend\r\n     former des vœux pour Galba, et lancer des imprécations contre\r\n     lui. Un passant lui dit: 'Voilà des gens qui cherchent Néron.' Son\r\n     cheval se cabre au milieu de la route: c'est qu'il a flairé un\r\n     cadavre. Le mouchoir qui couvrait son visage tombe; un prétorien\r\n     qui se trouvait là le ramasse et le rend à l'empereur, qu'il salue\r\n     par son nom. A chacun de ces incidents son effroi redouble. Enfin\r\n     il est arrivé à un petit chemin qui s'ouvre à notre gauche, dans la\r\n     direction de la voie Salara, parallèle à la voie Nomentane. C'est\r\n     entre ces deux voies qu'était la villa de Phaon, à quatre milles de\r\n     Rome. Pour l'attendre, Néron, qui a mis pied à terre, s'enfonce à\r\n     travers un fourré d'épines et un champ de roseaux comme il s'en\r\n     trouve tant dans la Campagne de Rome; il a peine de s'y frayer un\r\n     chemin; il arrive ainsi au mur de derrière de la villa. Près de là\r\n     était un de ces antres creusés pour l'extraction du sable\r\n     volcanique, appelé _pouzzolane_, tels qu'on en voit encore de ce\r\n     côté. Phaon engage le fugitif à s'y cacher; il refuse. On fait un\r\n     trou dans la muraille de la villa par où il pénètre, marchant\r\n     quatre pieds, dans l'intérieur. Il entre dans une petite salle et\r\n     se couche sur un lit formé d'un méchant matelas sur lequel on avait\r\n     jeté un vieux manteau. Ceux qui l'entourent le pressent de mourir\r\n     pour échapper aux outrages et au supplice. Il essaye à plusieurs\r\n     reprises de se donner la mort et n'y peut se résoudre; il pleure.\r\n     Enfin, en entendant les cavaliers qui venaient le saisir, il cite\r\n     un vers grec, fait un effort et se tue avec le secours d'un\r\n     affranchi.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 65.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmediately outside the Porta Pia is the entrance of the beautiful\r\n_Villa Patrizi_, whose grounds enclose the small _Catacomb of St.\r\nNicomedus_. Then comes the _Villa Lezzani_, where Sta. Giustina is\r\nburied in a chapel, and where her festa is observed on the 25th of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nBeyond this is the ridiculous _Villa Torlonia_ (shown with an order on\r\nWednesdays from 11 to 4, but not worth seeing), sprinkled with mock\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nAt little more than a mile from the gate the road reaches the _Basilica\r\nof St' Agnese fuori le Mura_, founded by Constantine at the request of\r\nhis daughter Constantia, in honour of the virgin martyr buried in the\r\nneighbouring catacomb; but rebuilt 625--38 by Honorius I. It was altered\r\nin 1490 by Innocent VIII., but retains more of its ancient character\r\nthan most of the Roman churches. The polychrome decorations of the\r\ninterior, and the rebuilding of the monastery, were carried out at the\r\nexpense of Pius IX., as a thank-offering for his escape, when he fell\r\nthrough the floor here into a cellar, with his cardinals and attendants,\r\non April 15, 1855. The scene is represented in a large fresco by\r\n_Domenico Tojetti_, in a chamber on the right of the courtyard.\r\n\r\nThe approach to the church is by a picturesque staircase of forty-five\r\nancient marble steps, lined with inscriptions from the catacombs. The\r\nnave is divided from the aisles by sixteen columns, four of which are of\r\n\"porta-santa\" and two of \"pavonazzetto.\" A smaller range of columns\r\nabove these supports the roof of a triforium, which is on a level with\r\nthe road. The baldacchino, erected in 1614, is supported by four\r\nporphyry columns. Beneath is the shrine of St. Agnes surmounted by her\r\nstatue, an antique of oriental alabaster, with modern head, and hands of\r\ngilt bronze. The mosaics of the tribune, representing St. Agnes between\r\nPopes Honorius I. and Symmachus, are of the seventh century. Beneath, is\r\nan ancient episcopal chair.\r\n\r\nThe second chapel on the right has a beautiful mosaic altar, and a\r\nrelief of SS. Stephen and Laurence of 1490. The third chapel is that of\r\nSt. Emerentiana, foster-sister of St. Agnes, who was discovered praying\r\nbeside the tomb of her friend, and was stoned to death because she\r\nrefused to sacrifice to idols.\r\n\r\n     \"So ancient is the worship paid to St. Agnes, that next to the\r\n     Evangelists and Apostles, there is no saint whose effigy is older.\r\n     It is found on the ancient glass and earthenware vessels used by\r\n     the Christians in the early part of the third century, with her\r\n     name inscribed, which leaves no doubt of her identity. But neither\r\n     in these images, nor in the mosaics, is the lamb introduced, which\r\n     in later times has become her inseparable attribute, as the\r\n     patroness of maidens and maidenly modesty.\"--_Jameson's Sacred\r\n     Art_, p. 105.\r\n\r\nSt. Agnes suffered martyrdom by being stabbed in the throat, under\r\nDiocletian, in her thirteenth year (see Ch. XIV.), after which,\r\naccording to the expression used in the acts of her martyrdom, her\r\nparents \"with all joy\" laid her in the catacombs. One day as they were\r\npraying near the body of their child, she appeared to them surrounded by\r\na great multitude of virgins, triumphant and glorious like herself, with\r\na lamb by her side, and said, \"I am in heaven, living with these virgins\r\nmy companions, near Him whom I have so much loved.\" By her tomb, also,\r\nConstantia, a princess sick with hopeless leprosy, was praying for the\r\nhealing of her body, when she heard a voice saying, \"Rise up,\r\nConstantia, and go on constantly ('Costanter age, Constantia') in the\r\nfaith of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who shall heal your\r\ndiseases,\"--and, being cured of her evil, she besought her father to\r\nbuild this basilica as a thank-offering.[243]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of January, a beautiful service is celebrated here, in which\r\ntwo lambs, typical of the purity of the virgin saint, are blessed upon\r\nthe altar. They are sent by the chapter of St. John Lateran, and their\r\nwool is afterwards used to make the pallium of the pope, which is\r\nconsecrated before it is worn, by being deposited in a golden urn upon\r\nthe tomb of St. Peter. The pallium is the sign of episcopal\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n     \"Ainsi, le simple ornement de laine que ces prélats doivent porter\r\n     sur leurs épaules comme symbole de la brebis du bon Pasteur, et que\r\n     le pontife Romain prend sur l'autel même de Saint Pierre pour le\r\n     leur adresser, va porter jusqu'aux extrémités de l'Eglise, dans une\r\n     union sublime, le double sentiment de la force du Prince des\r\n     Apôtres et de la douceur virginale d'Agnes.\"--_Dom Guéranger._\r\n\r\nClose to St' Agnese is the round _Church of Sta. Costanza_. erected by\r\nConstantine as a mausoleum for his daughters Constantia and Helena, and\r\nconverted into a church by Alexander IV. (1254--61) in honour of the\r\nPrincess Constantia, ob. 354, whose life is represented by Marcellinus\r\nas anything but saintlike, and who is supposed to have been confused in\r\nher canonization with a sainted nun of the same name. The rotunda,\r\nseventy-three feet in diameter, is surrounded by a vaulted corridor;\r\ntwenty-four double columns of granite support the dome. The vaulting is\r\ncovered with mosaic arabesques of the fourth century, of flowers and\r\nbirds, with scenes referring to a vintage. The same subjects are\r\nrepeated on the splendid porphyry sarcophagus of Sta. Costanza, of which\r\nthe interest is so greatly marred by its removal to the Vatican from its\r\nproper site, whence it was first stolen by Pope Paul II., who intended\r\nto use it as his own tomb.\r\n\r\n     \"Les enfants qui foulent le raisin, tels qu'on les voit dans les\r\n     mosaïques de l'église de Sainte Constance, les bas-reliefs de son\r\n     tombeau et ceux de beaucoup d'autres tombeaux chrétiens sont bien\r\n     d'origine païenne, car on les voit aussi figurer dans les\r\n     bas-reliefs où paraît Priape.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 257.\r\n\r\nBehind the two churches is an oblong space, ending in a fine mass of\r\nruin, which is best seen from the valley below. This was long supposed\r\nto be the Hippodrome of Constantine, but is now discovered to have\r\nbelonged to an early Christian cemetery.\r\n\r\n_The Catacomb of St Agnese_ is entered from a vineyard about a quarter\r\nof a mile beyond the church. It is lighted and opened to the public on\r\nSt. Agnes' Day. After those of St. Calixtus, this, perhaps, is the\r\ncatacomb which is most worthy of a visit.\r\n\r\nWe enter by a staircase attributed to the time of Constantine. The\r\npassages are lined with the usual _loculi_ for the dead, sometimes\r\nadapted for a single body, sometimes for two laid together. Beside many\r\nof the graves the palm of victory may be seen scratched on the mortar,\r\nand remains of the glass bottles or _ampullæ_, which are supposed to\r\nindicate the graves of martyrs, and to have contained a portion of their\r\nblood, of which they are often said to retain the trace. One of the\r\ngraves in the first gallery bears the names of consuls of A.D. 336,\r\nwhich fixes the date of this part of the cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting features here are a square chamber hewn in the\r\nrock, with an arm-chair (_sedia_) cut out of the rock on either side of\r\nthe entrance, supposed to have been a school for catechists,--and near\r\nthis is a second chamber for female catechists, with plain seats in the\r\nsame position. Opening out of the gallery close by is a chamber which\r\nwas apparently used as a chapel; its _arcosolium_ has marks of an altar\r\nremaining at the top of the grave, and near it is a credence-table; the\r\nroof is richly painted,--in the central compartment is our Lord seated\r\nbetween the rolls of the Old and New Testament. Above the arcosolium, in\r\nthe place of honour, is our Saviour as the Good Shepherd, bearing a\r\nsheep upon his shoulders, and standing between other sheep and\r\ntrees;--in the other compartments are Daniel in the lions' den, the\r\nThree Children in the furnace, Moses taking off his shoes, Moses\r\nstriking the rock, and--nearest the entrance--the Paralytic carrying his\r\nbed. A neighbouring chapel has also remains of an altar and\r\ncredence-table, and well-preserved paintings,--the Good Shepherd, Adam\r\nand Eve, with the tree between them, Jonah under the gourd, and in the\r\nfourth compartment a figure described by Protestants merely as an\r\nOrante, and by Roman Catholics as the Blessed Virgin.[244] Near this\r\nchapel we can look down through an opening into the second floor of the\r\ncatacomb, which is lined with graves like the first.\r\n\r\nIn the further part of the catacomb is a long narrow chapel which has\r\nreceived the name of the _cathedral_ or _basilica_. It is divided into\r\nthree parts, of which the furthest, or presbytery, contains an ancient\r\nepiscopal chair with lower seats on either side for priests--probably\r\nthe throne where Pope St. Liberius (A.D. 359) officiated, with his face\r\nto the people, when he lived for more than a year hidden here from\r\npersecution. Hence a flight of steps leads down to what Northcote calls\r\n\"the Lady Chapel,\" where, over the altar, is a fresco of an orante,\r\nwithout a nimbus, with outstretched arms,--with a child in front of her.\r\nOn either side of this picture, a very interesting one, is the monogram\r\nof Constantine, and the painting is referred to his time. Near this\r\nchapel is a chamber with a spring running through it, evidently used as\r\na baptistery.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the catacomb, under the basilica of St. Agnes, is\r\none of its most interesting features. Here the passages become wider and\r\nmore irregular, the walls sloping and unformed, and graves cease to\r\nappear, indicating one of the ancient _arenaria_, which here formed the\r\napproach to the catacomb, and beyond which the Christians excavated\r\ntheir cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe graves throughout almost all the catacombs have been rifled, the\r\nbones which they contained being distributed as relics throughout Roman\r\nCatholic Christendom, and most of the sarcophagi and inscriptions\r\nremoved to the Lateran and other museums.\r\n\r\n     \"Vous pourriez voir ici la capitale des catacombes de toute la\r\n     chrétienté. Les martyrs, les confesseurs, et les vierges, y\r\n     fourmillent de tous côtés. Quand on se fait besoin de quelques\r\n     reliques en pays étrangers, le Pape n'a qu'à descendre ici et\r\n     crier, _Qui de vous autres veut aller être saint en Pologne?_\r\n     Alors, s'il se trouve quelque mort de bonne volonté, il se lève et\r\n     s'en va.\"--_De Brosses_, 1739.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile beyond St' Agnese, the road reaches the willow-fringed river\r\nAnio, in which \"Silvia changed her earthly life for that of a goddess,\"\r\nand which carried the cradle containing her two babes Romulus and Remus\r\ninto the Tiber, to be brought to land at the foot of the Palatine\r\nfig-tree. Into this river we may also recollect that Sylla caused the\r\nashes of his ancient rival Marius to be thrown. The river is crossed by\r\nthe _Ponte Nomentana_, a mediæval bridge, partially covered, with forked\r\nbattlements.\r\n\r\n     \"Ponte Nomentana is a solitary dilapidated bridge in the spacious\r\n     green Campagna. Many ruins from the days of ancient Rome, and many\r\n     watch-towers from the middle ages, are scattered over this long\r\n     succession of meadows; chains of hills rise towards the horizon,\r\n     now partially covered with snow, and fantastically varied in form\r\n     and colour by the shadows of the clouds. And there is also the\r\n     enchanting vapoury vision of the Alban hills, which change their\r\n     hues like the chameleon, as you gaze at them--where you can see for\r\n     miles little white chapels glittering on the dark foreground of the\r\n     hills, as far as the Passionist Convent on the summit, and whence\r\n     you can trace the road winding through thickets, and the hills\r\n     sloping downwards to the lake of Albano, while a hermitage peeps\r\n     through the trees.\"--_Mendelssohn's Letters._\r\n\r\nThe hill immediately beyond the bridge is the _Mons Sacer_ (not only the\r\npart usually pointed out on the right of the road, but the whole\r\nhillside), to which the famous secession of the Plebs took place in B.C.\r\n549, amounting, according to Dionysius, to about 4000 persons. Here they\r\nencamped upon the green slopes for four months, to the terror of the\r\npatricians, who foresaw that Rome, abandoned by its defenders, would\r\nfall before its enemies, and that the crops would perish for want of\r\ncultivation. Here Menenius Agrippa delivered his apologue of the belly\r\nand its members, which is said to have induced them to return to Rome;\r\nthat which really decided them to do so being the concession of\r\ntribunes, to be the organs and representatives of the plebs as the\r\nconsuls were of the patricians. The epithet Sacer is ascribed by\r\nDionysius to an altar which the plebeians erected at the time on the\r\nhill to Ζεὑς Δειμἁτιος.\r\n\r\nA second secession to the Mons Sacer took place in B.C. 449, when the\r\nplebs rose against Appius Claudius after the death of Virginia, and\r\nretired hither under the advice of M. Duilius, till the decemvirs\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\nFollowing the road beyond the bridge past the castle known as _Casale\r\ndei Pazzi_ (once used as a lunatic asylum) and the picturesque tomb\r\ncalled Torre Nomentana,--as far as the seventh milestone--we reach the\r\nremains of the unburied _Basilica of S. Alessandro_, built on the site\r\nof the place where that pope suffered martyrdom with his companions\r\nEventius and Theodulus, A.D. 119, and was buried on the same spot by the\r\nChristian matron Severina.[245] The plan of the basilica, disinterred\r\n1856-7, is still quite perfect. The tribune and high altar retain\r\nfragments of rich marbles and alabasters; the episcopal throne also\r\nremains in its place.\r\n\r\nThe \"Acts of the martyrs Alexander, Eventius, and Theodulus,\" narrate\r\nthat Severina buried the bodies of the first two martyrs in one tomb,\r\nand the third separately--\"Theodulum vero alibi sepelivit.\" This is\r\nborne out by the discovery of a chapel opening from the nave, where the\r\nsingle word \"martyri,\" is supposed to point out the grave of Theodulus.\r\nA baptistery has been found with its font, and another chapel adjoining\r\nis pointed out as the place where neophytes assembled to receive\r\nconfirmation from the bishop. Among epitaphs laid bare in the pavement\r\nis one to a youth named Apollo \"votus Deo\" (dedicated to the\r\npriesthood?) at the age of 14. Entered from the church is the catacomb\r\ncalled \"ad nymphas,\" containing many ancient inscriptions and a few rude\r\npaintings.\r\n\r\nMass is solemnly performed here by the Cardinal Prefect of the\r\nPropaganda on the festival of St. Alexander, May 3, when the roofless\r\nbasilica--backed by the blue Sabine mountains and surrounded by the\r\nutterly desolate Campagna--is filled with worshippers, and presents a\r\nstriking scene. Beyond this a road to the left leads through beautiful\r\nwoods to _Mentana_, occupying the site of the ancient Nomentum, and\r\nrecently celebrated for the battle between the papal troops and the\r\nGaribaldians on Nov. 3, 1867. The conflict took place chiefly on the\r\nhillside which is passed on the right before reaching the town. Two\r\nmiles further is _Monte Rotondo_, with a fine old castle of the\r\nBarberini family (once of the Orsini), from which there is a beautiful\r\nview. This place was also the scene of fighting in 1867. It is possible\r\nto vary the route in returning to Rome from hence by the lower road\r\nwhich leads by the (now broken) Ponte Salara.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we re-enter Rome by the Porta Pia, immediately within the gates we\r\nfind another Villa belonging to the Torlonia family. The straight road\r\nfrom the gate leads by the Termini to the Quattro Fontane and the Monte\r\nCavallo. On the left, if we follow the _Via de Macao_, which takes its\r\nstrange name from a gift of land which the princes of Savoy made to the\r\nJesuits for a mission in China, we reach a small piazza with two pines,\r\nwhere a gate on the left leads to the remains of the _Pretorian Camp_,\r\nestablished by Sejanus, the minister of Tiberius. It was dismantled by\r\nConstantine, but from three sides having been enclosed by Aurelian in\r\nthe line of his city-wall, its form is still preserved to us. The\r\nPretorian Camp was an oblong of 1200 by 1500 feet; its area was occupied\r\nby a vineyard of the Jesuits till 1861, when a \"Campo Militare\" was\r\nagain established here, for the pontifical troops.\r\n\r\n     \"En suivant l'enceinte de Rome, quand on arrive à l'endroit où elle\r\n     se continue par le mur du Camp des prétoriens, on est frappé de la\r\n     supériorité de construction que présente celui-ci. La partie des\r\n     murs d'Honorius qui est voisine a été refaite au huitième siècle.\r\n     Le commencement et la fin de l'empire se touchent. On peut\r\n     apprécier d'un coup d'œil l'état de la civilisation aux deux\r\n     époques: voilà ce qu'on faisait dans le premier siècle, et voilà ce\r\n     qu'on faisait au huitième, après la conquête de l'empire Romain par\r\n     les Barbares. Il faut songer toutefois que cette époque où l'on\r\n     construisait si bien a amené celle où l'on ne savait plus\r\n     construire.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ i. 421.\r\n\r\nHence a road, three-quarters of a mile long, leads--passing under an\r\narch of Sixtus V.--to the Porta S. Lorenzo (Ch. XIII.).\r\n\r\nThe road opposite the gateway leading to the Camp is bordered on the\r\nleft by the buildings belonging to the _Railway Station_, beyond which\r\nis the entrance to the grounds of the _Villa Massimo Negroni_, which\r\npossessed a delightful terrace, fringed with orange-trees--a most\r\nagreeable sunny walk in winter--and many pleasant shady nooks and\r\ncorners for summer, but which has been mutilated and stripped of all its\r\nbeauties since the Sardinian rule. In a part of this villa beyond the\r\nrailway but still visible from hence, is a colossal statue of Minerva\r\n(generally called \"Rome\"), which is a relic of the residence here of\r\nCardinal Felix Perretti, who as a boy had watched the pigs of his father\r\nat Montalto, and who lived to mount the papal throne as Sixtus V. The\r\npedestal of the statue bears his arms,--a lion holding three pears in\r\nits paw. Here, with her husband's uncle, lived the famous Vittoria\r\nAccoramboni, the wife of the handsome Francesco Perretti, who had been\r\nvainly sought in marriage by the powerful and ugly old Prince Paolo\r\nOrsini. It was from hence that her young husband was summoned to a\r\nsecret interview with her brothers on the slopes of the Quirinal, where\r\nhe was cruelly murdered by the hired bravos of her first lover. Hence\r\nalso Vittoria went forth--on the very day of the installation of Sixtus\r\nV.--to her strange second marriage with the murderer of her husband, who\r\ndied six months after, leaving her with one of the largest fortunes in\r\nItaly--an amount of wealth which led to her own barbarous murder through\r\nthe jealousy of the Orsini a month afterwards.\r\n\r\nHere, after the election of her brother to the papacy, lived Camilla,\r\nthe sister of Sixtus V., whom he refused to recognise when she came to\r\nhim in splendid attire as a princess, but tenderly embraced when she\r\nreappeared in her peasant's wimple and hood. From hence her two\r\ngranddaughters were married,--one to Virginius Orsini, the other to\r\nMarc-Antonio Colonna, an alliance which healed the feud of centuries\r\nbetween the two families.\r\n\r\nIn later times the Villa Negroni was the residence of the poet Alfieri.\r\n\r\nThe principal terrace ends near a reservoir which belonged to the baths\r\nof Diocletian.\r\n\r\n     \"As one looks from the Villa Negroni windows, one cannot fail to be\r\n     impressed by the strange changes through which this wonderful city\r\n     has passed. The very spot on which Nero, the insane emperor-artist,\r\n     fiddled while Rome was burning, has now become a vast\r\n     kitchen-garden, belonging to Prince Massimo (himself a descendant,\r\n     as he claims, of Fabius Cunctator), where men no longer, but only\r\n     lettuces, asparagus, and artichokes, are ruthlessly cut down. The\r\n     inundations are not for mock sea-fights among slaves, but for the\r\n     peaceful purposes of irrigation. In the bottom of the valley, a\r\n     noble old villa, covered with frescoes, has been turned into a\r\n     manufactory for bricks, and part of the Villa Negroni itself is now\r\n     occupied by the railway station. Yet here the princely family of\r\n     Negroni lived, and the very lady at whose house Lucrezia Borgia\r\n     took her famous revenge may once have sauntered under the walls,\r\n     which still glow with ripening oranges, to feed the gold fish in\r\n     the fountain,--or walked with stately friends through the long\r\n     alleys of clipped cypresses, or pic-nicked _alla Giornata_ on lawns\r\n     which are now but kitchen-gardens, dedicated to San\r\n     Cavolo.\"--_Story's Roba di Roma._\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the Villa Negroni, and the slopes towards the\r\nEsquiline, were once celebrated as the _Campus Esquilinus_, a large\r\npauper burial-ground, where bodies were thrown into pits called\r\n_puticoli_,[246] as is still the custom at Naples. There were also tombs\r\nhere of a somewhat pretentious character: \"those probably of rich\r\nwell-to-do burgesses, yet not great enough to command the posthumous\r\nhonour of a roadside mausoleum.\"[247] Horace dwells on the horrors of\r\nthis burial-ground, where he places the scene of Canidia's\r\nincantations:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nec in sepulcris pauperum prudens anus\r\n    Novemdiales dissipare pulveres.\"\r\n        _Epod._ xvii. 47.\r\n\r\n                    'Has nullo perdere possum\r\n    Nec prohibere modo, simul ac vaga luna decorum\r\n    Protulit os, quin ossa legant, herbasque nocentes.\r\n    Vidi egomet nigrâ succinctam vadere pallâ\r\n    Canidiam, pedibus nudis passoque capillo,\r\n    Cum Saganâ majore ululantem; pallor utrasque\r\n    Fecerat horrendas aspectu,\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            Serpentes atque videres\r\n    Infernas errare canes; lunamque rubentem,\r\n    Ne foret his testis, post magna latere sepulcra.\"\r\n           _Hor. Sat._ i. 8'\r\n\r\nThe place was considered very unhealthy until its purification by\r\nMæcenas.\r\n\r\n    \"Huc prius angustis ejecta cadavera cellis\r\n    Conservus vili portanda locabat in arcâ.\r\n    Hoc miseræ plebi stabat commune sepulcrum,\r\n    Pantolabo scurræ, Nomentanoque nepoti.\r\n    Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum\r\n    Hîc dabat; heredes monumentum ne sequeretur.\r\n    Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus, atque\r\n    Aggere in aprico spatiari; quo modo tristes\r\n    Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum.\"\r\n\r\n    _Hor. Sat._ i. 8.\r\n\r\n    \"Post insepulta membra different lupi,\r\n    Et Esquilinæ alites.\"\r\n\r\n    _Hor. Ep._ v. 100.\r\n\r\n     \"The Campus Esquilinus, between the roads which issued from the\r\n     Esquiline and Viminal gates, was the spot assigned for casting out\r\n     the carcases of slaves, whose foul and half-burnt remains were\r\n     hardly hidden from the vultures. The _accursed field_ was enclosed,\r\n     it would appear, neither by wall nor fence, to exclude the\r\n     wandering steps of man or beast; and from the public walk on the\r\n     summit of the ridge, it must have been viewed in all its horrors.\r\n     Here prowled in troops the houseless dogs of the city and the\r\n     suburbs; here skulked the solitary wolf from the Alban hills, and\r\n     here perhaps, to the doleful murmurs of the Marsic chaunt, the\r\n     sorceress compounded her philtres of the ashes of dead men's bones.\r\n     Mæcenas (B.C. 7) deserved the gratitude of the citizens, when he\r\n     obtained a grant of this piece of land, and transformed it into a\r\n     park or garden.... The Campus Esquilinus is now part of the gardens\r\n     of the Villa Negroni.\"--_Merivale, Romans under the Empire._\r\n\r\nWithin what were the grounds of the Villa Negroni until they were\r\nencroached upon by the railway, but now only to be visited with a\r\n\"lascia passare\" from the station master, are some of the best remains\r\nof the _Agger of Servius Tullius_. In 1869--70, some curious painted\r\nchambers were discovered here, but were soon destroyed,--and the foolish\r\njealousy of the authorities prevented any drawings or photographs being\r\ntaken. The Agger can be traced from the Porta Esquilina (near the Arch\r\nof Gallienus), to the Porta Collina (near the Gardens of Sallust). In\r\nthe time of the empire it had become a kind of promenade, as we learn\r\nfrom Horace.[248]\r\n\r\nOpposite the station are the vast, but for the most part uninteresting,\r\nremains of the _Baths of Diocletian_, covering a space of 440,000 square\r\nyards. They were begun by Diocletian and Maximian, about A.D. 302, and\r\nfinished by Constantius and Maximinus. It is stated by Cardinal\r\nBaronius, that 40,000 Christians were employed in the work; some bricks\r\nmarked with crosses have been found in the ruins. At the angles of the\r\nprincipal front were two circular halls, both of which remain; one is\r\nnear the modern Villa Strozzi, at the back of the Negroni garden, and is\r\nnow used as a granary, the other is transformed into the Church of S.\r\nBernardo.\r\n\r\nThe Baths are supposed to have first fallen into decay after the Gothic\r\ninvasion of A.D. 410. In the sixteenth century the site was sold to\r\nCardinal Bella, ambassador of Francis I. at Rome, who built a fine\r\npalace among the ruins; after his death, in 1560, the property was\r\nre-sold to S. Carlo Borromeo. He sold it again to his uncle, Pope Pius\r\nIV., who founded the monastery of Carthusian monks. These, in 1593, sold\r\npart of the ruins to Caterina Sforza, who founded the Cistercian convent\r\nof S. Bernardo.\r\n\r\nAbout 1520, a Sicilian priest called Antonio del Duca came to Rome,\r\nbringing with him from Palermo pictures of the seven archangels\r\n(Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Santhiel, Gendiel, and Borachiel),\r\ncopied from some which existed in the Church of S. Angiolo. Carried away\r\nby the desire of instituting archangel-worship at Rome, he obtained\r\nleave to affix these pictures to seven of the columns still standing\r\nerect in the Baths of Diocletian, which, ten years after, Julius II.\r\nallowed to be consecrated under the title of Sta. Maria degli Angeli;\r\nthough Pius IV., declaring that angel-worship had never been sanctioned\r\nby the Church, except under the three names mentioned in Scripture,\r\nordered the pictures of Del Duca to be taken away.[249] At the same time\r\nhe engaged Michael Angelo to convert the great oblong hall of the Baths\r\n(Calidarium) into a church. The church then arranged was not such as we\r\nnow see, the present entrance having been then the atrium of the side\r\nchapel, and the main entrance at first by what is now the right\r\ntransept, while the high altar stood in what is now the left transept.\r\nIn 1749, the desire of erecting a chapel to the Beato Nicolo Albergati,\r\nled to the church being altered, under Vanvitelli, as we now see it.\r\n\r\nThe _Church of Sta. Maria degli Angeli_, still most magnificent, is now\r\nentered by a rotunda (Laconicum) which contains four monuments of some\r\ninterest; on the right of the entrance is that of the artist Carlo\r\nMaratta, who died 1713; on the left that of Salvator Rosa, who died\r\n1673, with an epitaph by his son, describing him as \"Pictorum sui\r\ntemporis nulli secundum, poetarum omnium temporum principibus parem!\"\r\nBeyond, on the right, is the monument of Cardinal Alciati, professor of\r\nlaw at Milan, who procured his hat through the interest of S. Carlo\r\nBorromeo, with the epitaph \"Virtute vixit, memoria vivit, gloria\r\nvivet,\"--on the left, that of Cardinal Parisio di Corenza, inscribed,\r\n\"Corpus humo tegitur, fama per ora volat, spiritus astra tenet.\" In the\r\nchapel on the right are the angels of Peace and Justice, by _Pettrich_;\r\nin that on the left Christ appearing to the Magdalen, by _Arrigo\r\nFiamingo_. Against the pier on the right is the grand statue of S.\r\nBruno, by _Houdon_, of which Clement XIV. (Ganganelli) used to say, \"He\r\nwould speak, if the rule of his Order did not forbid it.\"\r\n\r\nThe body of the church is now a perfect gallery of very large pictures,\r\nmost of which were brought from St. Peter's, where their places have\r\nbeen supplied by mosaic copies. In what is now the right transept, on\r\nthe right, is the Crucifixion of St. Peter, _Ricciolini_; the Fall of\r\nSimon Magus, a copy of _Francesco Vanni_ (the original in St. Peter's);\r\non the left, St. Jerome, with St. Bruno and St. Francis, _Muziano_\r\n(1528--92) (the landscape by _Brill_); and the Miracles of St. Peter,\r\n_Baglioni_. This transept ends in the chapel of the Beato Nicolo\r\nAlbergati, a Carthusian Cardinal, who was sent as legate by Martin V.,\r\nin 1422, to make a reconciliation between Charles VI. of France and\r\nHenry V. of England. The principal miracle ascribed to him, the\r\nconversion of bread into coal in order to convince the Emperor of\r\nGermany of his divine authority, is represented in the indifferent\r\naltar-piece. In the left transept, which ends in the chapel of S. Bruno,\r\nare: on the left, St. Basil by the solemnity of the Mass rebuking the\r\nEmperor Valens, _Subleyras_; and the Fall of Simon Magus, _Pompeo\r\nBattoni_;--on the right, the Immaculate Conception, _P. Bianchi_; and\r\nTabitha raised from the Dead, _P. Costanzi_.\r\n\r\nIn the tribune are, on the right, the Presentation of the Virgin in the\r\nTemple, _Romanelli_; and the Martyrdom of St. Sebastian, a grand fresco\r\nof _Domenichino_, painted originally on the walls of St. Peter's, and\r\nremoved here with great skill by the engineer Zabaglia;--on the left,\r\nthe Death of Ananias and Sapphira, _Pomarancio_; and the Baptism of\r\nChrist, _Maratta_.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the choir is the tomb of Cardinal Antonio Serbelloni; on\r\nthe left that of Pius IV., Giovanni Angelo Medici (1559-1565), under\r\nwhose reign the Council of Trent was closed,--uncle of S. Carlo\r\nBorromeo, a lively and mundane pope, but the cruel persecutor of the\r\nCaraffa nephews of his predecessor, Paul IV., whom he executed in the\r\nCastle of S. Angelo.\r\n\r\nOf the sixteen columns in this church (45 feet in height, 16 feet in\r\ndiameter), only the eight in the transept are of ancient Egyptian\r\ngranite; the rest are in brick, stuccoed in imitation, and were\r\nadditions of Vanvitelli. On the pavement is a meridian line, laid down\r\nin 1703.\r\n\r\n     \"Quand Dioclétien faisait travailler les pauvres chrétiens à ses\r\n     étuves, ce n'était pas son dessein de bâtir des églises à leurs\r\n     successeurs; il ne pensait pas être fondateur, comme il l'a été,\r\n     d'un monastère de Pères Chartreux et d'un monastère de Pères\r\n     Feuillants.... C'est aux dépens de Dioclétien, de ses pierres et de\r\n     son ciment qu'on fait des autels et des chapelles à Jesus-Christ,\r\n     des dortoirs et des réfectoires à ses serviteurs. La providence de\r\n     Dieu se joue de cette sorte des pensées des hommes, et les\r\n     événements sont bien éloignés des intentions quand la terre a un\r\n     dessein et le ciel un autre.\"--_Balzac._\r\n\r\nThe Carthusian convent behind the church (ladies are not admitted)\r\ncontains several picturesque fountains. That in the great cloister,\r\nbuilt from designs of Michael Angelò, is surrounded by a group of huge\r\nand grand cypresses, said to have been planted by his hand.\r\n\r\n     \"Il semble que la vie ne sert ici qu'à contempler la mort--les\r\n     hommes qui existent ainsi sont pourtant les mêmes à qui la guerre\r\n     et toute son activité suffirait à peine s'ils y étaient accoutumés.\r\n     C'est un sujet inépuisable de réflexion que les différentes\r\n     combinaisons de la destinée humaine sur la terre. Il se passe dans\r\n     l'intérieur de l'âme mille accidents, il se forme mille habitudes,\r\n     qui font de chaque individu un monde et son histoire.\"--_Madame de\r\n     Staël._\r\n\r\nOn a line with the monastery is a Prison for Women--then an Institution\r\nfor Deaf, Dumb, and Blind--then the ugly _Fountain of the Termini_\r\n(designed by Fontana), sometimes called Fontanone dell' Acqua Felice,\r\n(Felice, from Fra Felice, the name by which Sixtus V. was known before\r\nhis papacy,) to which the Acqua Felice was brought from Colonna 22 miles\r\ndistant in the Alban hills, in 1583, by Sixtus V. It is surmounted by a\r\nhideous statue of Moses by _Prospero Bresciano_, who is said to have\r\ndied of vexation at the ridicule it excited when uncovered. The side\r\nstatues, of Aaron and Gideon, are by _Giov. Batt. della Porta_ and\r\n_Flaminio Vacca_.\r\n\r\nOpposite this, in the Via della Porta Pia, is the _Church of Sta. Maria\r\ndella Vittoria_, built in 1605, by Carlo Maderno, for Paul V. Its façade\r\nwas added from designs of Giov. Batt. Soria, by Cardinal Borghese, in\r\npayment to the monks of the adjoining Carmelite convent, for the statue\r\nof the Hermaphrodite, which had been found in their vineyard.\r\n\r\nThe name of the church commemorates an image of the Virgin, burnt in\r\n1833, which was revered as having been instrumental in gaining the\r\nvictory for the Catholic imperial troops over the Protestant Frederick\r\nand Elizabeth of Bohemia, at the battle of the White Mountain, near\r\nPrague. The third chapel on the left contains the Trinity, by\r\n_Guercino_; a Crucifixion, by _Guido_; and a portrait of Cardinal\r\nCornaro, _Guido_. The altar-piece of the second chapel on the right,\r\nrepresenting St. Francis receiving the Infant Christ from the Virgin, is\r\nby _Domenichino_, as are two frescoes on the side walls. In the left\r\ntransept, above an altar adorned with a gilt bronze-relief of the Last\r\nSupper, by Cav. d'Arpino, is a group representing Sta. Teresa transfixed\r\nby the dart of the Angel of Death, by _Bernini_. The following\r\ncriticisms upon it are fair specimens of the contrast between English\r\nand French taste.\r\n\r\n     \"All the Spanish pictures of Sta. Theresa sin in their materialism;\r\n     but the grossest example--the most offensive--is the marble group\r\n     of Bernini, in the Santa Maria della Vittoria at Rome. The head of\r\n     Sta. Theresa is that of a languishing nymph, the angel is a sort of\r\n     Eros; the whole has been significantly described as 'a parody of\r\n     Divine love.' The vehicle, white marble,--its place in a Christian\r\n     church,--enhance all its vileness. The least destructive, the\r\n     least prudish in matters of art, would here willingly throw the\r\n     first stone.\"--_Mrs. Jameson's Monastic Orders_, p. 421.\r\n\r\n     \"La sainte Thérèse de Bernin est adorable! couchée, évanouie\r\n     d'amour les mains, les pieds nus pendants, les yeux demiclos, elle\r\n     s'est laissée tomber de bonheur et d'extase. Son visage est maigri,\r\n     mais combien noble! C'est la vraie grande dame qui a séché dans les\r\n     feux, dans les larmes, en attendant celui qu'elle aime. Jusqu'aux\r\n     draperies tortillées, jusqu'à l'allanguissement des mains\r\n     défaillantes, jusqu'au soupir qui meurt sur ses levres\r\n     entr'ouvertes, il n'y a rien en elle ni autour d'elle qui n'exprime\r\n     l'angoisse volupteuse et le divin élancement de son transport. On\r\n     ne peut pas rendre avec des mots une attitude si enivrée et si\r\n     touchante. Renversée sur le dos, elle pâme, tout son être se\r\n     dissout; le moment poignant arrive, elle gémit; c'est son dernier\r\n     gémissement, la sensation est trop forte. L'ange cependant, un\r\n     jeune page de quatorze ans, en légère tunique, la poitrine\r\n     découverte jusqu'au dessous du sein, arrive gracieux, aimable;\r\n     c'est le plus joli page de grand seigneur qui vient faire le\r\n     bonheur d'une vassal trop tendre. Un sourire demi-complaisant,\r\n     demi-malin, creuse des fossettes dans ses fraîches joues luisantes;\r\n     sa flêche d'or à la main indique le tressaillement délicieux et\r\n     terrible dont il va secouer tous les nerfs de ce corps charmant,\r\n     ardent, qui s'étale devant sa main. On n'a jamais fait ce roman si\r\n     séduisant et si tendre.\"--_Taine, Voyage en Italie._\r\n\r\nClose by is the handsome _Church of Sta. Susanna_, rebuilt by _Carlo\r\nMaderno_, for Sixtus V., on the site of an oratory founded by Pope Caius\r\n(A.D. 283), in the house of his brother Gabinus, who was martyred with\r\nhis daughter Susanna because she refused to break her vow of virginity\r\nby a marriage with Maximianus Galerus, adopted son of the Emperor\r\nDiocletian, to whom this family were related. The bodies of these\r\nmartyrs are said to rest beneath the high altar. The side chapel of St.\r\nLaurence was presented by Camilla Peretti, the sister of Sixtus V.,\r\ntogether with a dowry of fifty scudi, to be paid every year to the nine\r\nbest girls in the parish, on the festival of Sta. Susanna. The frescoes\r\nof the story of Susanna and the Elders, painted here on the side walls,\r\nfrom the analogy of names, are by _Baldassare Croce_; those in the\r\ntribune are by _Cesare Nebbia_.\r\n\r\nOpposite this, is the Cistercian convent and _Church of S. Bernardo_, a\r\nrotunda of the Baths of Diocletian, turned into a church in 1598, by\r\nCaterina Sforza, Contessa di Santa Fiora.\r\n\r\nHence the Via della Porta Pia leads to the Quattro Fontane. On the left\r\nis the small _Church of S. Caio_, which encloses the tomb of that pope,\r\ninscribed \"Sancti Caii, Papæ, martyris ossa.\" Further, on the left, is\r\nthe great recently suppressed convent of the Carmelites, and the _Church\r\nof Sta. Teresa_. The right of the street is bordered by the\r\norange-shaded wall of the Barberini garden.\r\n\r\nBetween S. Caio and Sta. Teresa, is the _Studio of Overbeck_, the\r\nvenerable German devotional painter, who died 1869. His daughter allows\r\nvisitors to be admitted on Sunday afternoons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE ESQUILINE.\r\n\r\n     Golden House of Nero--Baths of Titus and Trajan--S. Pietro in\r\n     Vincoli--Frangipani Tower--House of Lucrezia Borgia--S. Martino al\r\n     Monte--Sta. Lucia in Selce--Sta. Prassede--Santissimo\r\n     Redentore--Arch of Gallienus--Trophies of Marius--Sta.\r\n     Bibiana--Temple of Minerva Medica--S. Eusebio--S. Antonio\r\n     Abbate--Sta. Maria Maggiore.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Esquiline, which is the largest of the so-called 'hills of Rome,' is\r\nnot a distinct hill, but simply a projection of the Campagna. \"The\r\nQuirinal, Viminal, Esquiline, and Cœlian stretch out towards the\r\nTiber, like four fingers of a hand, of which the plain whence they\r\ndetach themselves represents the vast palm. This hand has seized the\r\nworld.\"[250]\r\n\r\nVarro says that the name Esquiline was derived from the word _excultus_,\r\nbecause of the ornamental groves which were planted on this hill by\r\nServius Tullius,--such as the Lucus Querquetulanus, Fagutalis, and\r\nEsquilinus.[251] The sacred wood of the Argiletum long remained on the\r\nlower slope of the hill, where the Via Sta. Maria dei Monti now is.\r\n\r\nThe Esquiline, which is still unhealthy, must have been so in ancient\r\ntimes, for among its temples were those dedicated to Fever, near Sta.\r\nMaria Maggiore--to Juno Mephitis,[252] near a pool which emitted\r\npoisonous exhalations--and to Venus Libitina,[253] for the registration\r\nof deaths, and arrangement of funerals. As the hill was in the hands of\r\nthe Sabines, its early divinities were Sabine. Besides those already\r\nmentioned, it had an altar of the Sabine sun-god Janus, dedicated\r\ntogether with an altar to Juno by the survivor of the Horatii,[254] and\r\na temple of Juno Lucina, the goddess of birth and light.\r\n\r\n    \"Monte sub Esquilio multis incæduus annis\r\n    Junonis magnæ nomine lucus erat.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ ii. 435.\r\n\r\nThis hill has two heights. That which is crowned by Santa Maria Maggiore\r\nwas formerly called _Cispius_, where Servius Tullius had a palace; that\r\nwhich is occupied by S. Pietro in Vincoli was formerly called _Oppius_,\r\nwhere Tarquinius Superbus lived. It was in returning to his palace on\r\nthe former (and not on the latter height, as generally maintained) that\r\nServius Tullius was murdered.\r\n\r\nThe most important buildings of the Esquiline, in the later republican\r\nand in imperial times, were on the slope of the hill behind the Forum,\r\nand near the Coliseum, in the fashionable quarter called Carinæ,--the\r\n\"rich Carinæ,\"\r\n\r\n          \"Passimque armenta videbant\r\n    Romanoque Foro et lautis mugire Carinis.\"\r\n\r\n    _Virgil, Æn._ viii. 361.\r\n\r\nof which the principal street probably occupied the site of the present\r\nVia del Colosseo. At the entrance of this suburb, where the fine\r\nmediæval Torre dei Conti now stands, was the house of Spurius Cassius\r\n(Consul B.C. 493), which was confiscated and demolished, and the ground\r\nordained to be always kept vacant, because he was suspected of aiming at\r\nregal power. Here, however, or very nearly on this site, the _Ædes\r\nTelluris_, or temple of Tellus, was erected _c._ B.C. 269,[255]--a\r\nbuilding of sufficient importance for the senate, summoned by Antony, to\r\nassemble in it. The quarter immediately surrounding this temple acquired\r\nthe name of _In Tellure_, which is still retained by several of its\r\nmodern churches.[256] Near this temple--\"in tellure,\" lived Pompey, in a\r\nfamous though small historical house, which he adorned on the outside\r\nwith rostra in memory of his naval victories, and which was painted\r\nwithin to look like a forest with trees and birds, much probably as the\r\nchambers are painted which were discovered a few years ago in the villa\r\nof Livia.[257] Here Julia, the daughter of Julius Cæsar, and wife of\r\nPompey, died. After the death of Pompey this house was bought by the\r\nluxurious Antony. The difference between its two masters is pourtrayed\r\nby Cicero, who describes the severe comfort of the house of Pompey\r\ncontrasted with the voluptuous luxury of its second master, and winds up\r\nhis oration by exclaiming, \"I pity even the roofs and the walls under\r\nthe change.\" At a later period the same house was the favourite\r\nresidence of Antoninus Pius. Hard by, in the Carinæ, the favourite\r\nresidence of Roman knights, lived the father of Cicero, and hence the\r\nyoung Tullius went to listen in the forum to the orators whom he was one\r\nday to surpass.[258] Also in the Carinæ, but nearer the site of the\r\nColiseum, was the magnificent house of the wealthy Vedius Pollio, which\r\nhe bequeathed to Augustus, who pulled it down, and built the portico of\r\nLivia on its site:\r\n\r\n    \"Disce tamen, veniens ætas, ubi Livia nunc est\r\n      Porticus, immensæ tecta fuisse domûs.\r\n    Urbis opus domus una fuit; spatiumque tenebat,\r\n      Quo brevius muris oppida multa tenent.\r\n    Hæc æquata solo est, nullo sub crimine regni,\r\n      Sed quia luxuriâ visa nocere suâ.\r\n    Sustinuit tantas operum subvertere moles,\r\n      Totque suas heres perdere Cæsar opes.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ vi. 639.\r\n\r\nAt its opposite extremity the Carinæ was united to the unfashionable and\r\nplebeian quarter of the _Suburra_, occupying the valley formed by the\r\nconvergence of the Esquiline, Quirinal, and Viminal--which is still\r\ncrowded with a teeming population. In one of the small streets leading\r\nfrom the Vicus Cyprius (between the Esquiline and Viminal) towards the\r\nCarinæ, was the _Tigellum Sororis_, which was extant--repaired at the\r\npublic expense--till the fifth century. This, \"the Sister's Beam,\"\r\ncommemorated the well-known story of the last of the Horatii, who,\r\nreturning from the slaughter of the Curiatii, and being met by his\r\nsister, bewailing one of the dead to whom she was betrothed, stabbed her\r\nin his anger. He was condemned to death, but at the prayer of his father\r\nhis crime was expiated by his passing under the yoke of \"the Sister's\r\nBeam.\" On one side of the Tigellum Sororis was an altar to Juno Sororis;\r\non the other an altar to Janus Curiatius.[259]\r\n\r\nDuring the empire several poets had their residence on the Esquiline.\r\nVirgil lived there, near the gardens of Mæcenas, which covered the\r\nslopes between the Esquiline and Viminal. Propertius had a house there,\r\nas we learn from himself--\r\n\r\n    \"I, puer, et citus hæc aliqua propone columna\r\n    Et dominum Esquiliis scribe habitare tuum.\"\r\n\r\n    _Propert. Eleg._ iv. 23.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, but without certainty, that Horace also lived upon the\r\nEsquiline. He was constantly there in the villa of Mæcenas, where he was\r\nburied, and which he has described in his poems both in its original\r\nstate as a desecrated cemetery, and again after his friend had converted\r\nit into a beautiful garden.\r\n\r\n    \"Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus, atque\r\n    Aggere in aprico spatiari, quo modo tristes\r\n    Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum.\"\r\n\r\n    _Sat._ i.\r\n\r\nThe house of Mæcenas, the great patron of the poets of the Augustan age,\r\nprobably occupied a site above the Carinæ, where the baths of Titus\r\nafterwards were. It was a lofty and magnificent edifice, and is\r\ndescribed by Horace, who calls it--\r\n\r\n    \"Fastidiosam desere copiam, et\r\n    Molem propinquam nubibus arduis:\r\n      Omitte mirari beatæ\r\n        Fumum et opes strepitumque Romæ.\"\r\n\r\n    _Od._ iii. 29.\r\n\r\nMæcenas bequeathed his villa to Augustus, and Tiberius at one time\r\nresided in it.\r\n\r\nAnother, though less well-known poet of this age, who lived upon the\r\nEsquiline, was Pedo Albinovanus, much extolled by Ovid, who lived at the\r\nsummit of the Vicus Cyprius (probably the Via Sta. Maria Maggiore), in a\r\nlittle house:\r\n\r\n    \"Illic parva tui domus Pedonis\r\n        Cælata est aquilæ minore penna.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, x. _Ep._ 19.\r\n\r\nNear this was the _Lacus Orphei_, a fountain, in the centre of which was\r\na rock, &c., surmounted by a statue of Orpheus with the enchanted beasts\r\naround him. The house of Pedo was afterwards inhabited by Pliny. On\r\n_Septimius_, as the furthest slope of the Esquiline towards the Viminal\r\nwas called, lived Maximus--of whom Martial says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Esquiliis domus est, domus est tibi colle Dianæ,\r\n      Et tua Patricius culmina Vicus habet:\r\n    Hinc viduæ Cybeles, illinc sacraria Vestæ,\r\n      Inde Novum, Veterem prospicis inde Jovem.\"\r\n\r\n    _Mart._ vii. _Ep._ 72.\r\n\r\nOnly the northern side of the Esquiline is now inhabited at all; the\r\nsouthern, and by far the larger portion, is clothed with vineyards and\r\ngardens, sprinkled over with titanic masses of ruin. On most parts of\r\nthe hill, one might imagine oneself far away in the country. According\r\nto Niebuhr, the dweller amid the vines of the Esquiline, when he\r\ndescends into the city, still says, \"I am going to Rome.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNero (A.D. 54--68) purchased the site of the villa of Mæcenas, and\r\ncovered the whole side of the hill towards the Carinæ with the vast\r\nbuildings of his Golden House, which also swallowed up the Cœlian and\r\na great part of the Palatine; but he did not destroy the buildings which\r\nalready existed, and \"the Golden House was still the old mansion of\r\nAugustus and the villa of Mæcenas connected by a long series of columns\r\nand arches.\"[260] Titus (A.D. 79--81) and Trajan (A.D. 98--117) used\r\npart of the same site for their baths, and the ruins of all these\r\nbuildings are now jumbled up together, and the varying whims of\r\nantiquaries have constantly changed the names of each fragment that has\r\nbeen discovered.\r\n\r\nThe more interesting of these ruins are on the southern slope of the\r\nEsquiline towards the Coliseum, and are most easily approached from the\r\nVia Polveriera. They are shown now as the _Baths of Titus_, or Camere\r\nEsquiline, and occupy a space of about 1150 feet by 850. That the\r\nchambers which are now visible were to be seen in the time of Leo X.\r\n(1513--22) we learn from Vasari, who says that Raphael and Giovanni da\r\nUdine were wont to study there and copy the arabesques to assist their\r\nwork in the Vatican Loggie. After this, neglect and the falling in of\r\nthe soil caused these treasures to be lost till 1774, when they were\r\nagain partially unearthed, but they were only completely brought to view\r\nby the French, who began to take the work in hand in 1811, and continued\r\ntheir excavations for three years.\r\n\r\nThe principal remains, which are now exhibited by the dim torch of a\r\nsolitary cicerone, are those of nine chambers, extending for 300 feet,\r\nand having on the north a kind of corridor, or cryptoporticus, whose\r\nvault is covered with paintings of birds, griffins, and flowers, &c. In\r\ntwo of these halls are alcoves for couches, and in one is a cavity for a\r\nfountain with a trench round it, like that in the nymphæum of the Palace\r\nof the Cæsars. In one of the halls is a group representing Venus\r\nattended by two Cupids, with doves hovering over her. Near this a\r\npedestal is shown as that occupied by the Laocoon, though it was really\r\nfound in the Vigna de Fredis, between the Sette Sale and Sta. Maria\r\nMaggiore. A set of thirty engravings, published by Mirri, from drawings\r\ntaken in 1776, show what the paintings were at that time, but very few\r\nnow remain perfect. A group of Coriolanus and his mother, represented in\r\nMirri's work, is now inaccessible. All the paintings are Pompeian in\r\ncharacter, and for some time were considered the best remains of ancient\r\npictorial art in Rome, but they are inferior to those which have since\r\nbeen discovered on the Latin way and at the Baths of Livia. The chambers\r\nwhich open beyond the nine outer halls are considered to be part of the\r\nGolden House. In one of these the Meleager of the Vatican was found. A\r\nsmall chapel, dedicated to Sta. Felicitas and her seven sons (evidently\r\nengrafted upon the pagan building in the sixth century), was discovered\r\nin 1813. It is like the chapels in the catacombs, and is decorated with\r\nthe conventional frescoes of the Good Shepherd, Daniel in the lions'\r\nden, &c. There are also some faint remains of a fresco of the sainted\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\nBehind the convent of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in the open vineyards, are\r\nother ruins called the _Sette Sale_, being remains of the reservoirs (in\r\nreality nine in number) for the Baths. In these vineyards also are three\r\nlarge circular ruins, adorned on the interior with rows of niches for\r\nstatues. One of them is partly built into the Polveriera, or powder\r\nmagazine. These have been referred alternately to the Baths of Titus\r\nand those of Trajan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the forum of Nerva stands the colossal brick tower,\r\nknown as the Torre dei Conti, and built by Innocent III. (1198--1216) as\r\na retreat for his family, now extinct. Its architect was Marchione\r\nd'Arezzo, and it was so much admired by Petrarch that he declared it had\r\n\"no equal upon earth;\" he must have meant in height. Four of the Conti\r\nhave mounted the papal throne, Innocent III., Gregory IX., Alexander\r\nIV., and Innocent XIII. The last-named pope (1721--24) boasted of having\r\n\"nine uncles, eight brothers, four nephews, and seven great nephews;\"\r\nyet--a century after--and not a Conti remained.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the left close to this, we shall find, in a commanding\r\nposition, the famous Church of _S. Pietro in Vincoli_, said to have been\r\noriginally founded in A.D. 109 by Theodora, sister of Hermes, Prefect of\r\nRome, both converts of the then pope, who was the martyr St. Alexander\r\nof the basilica in the Campagna. A bolder legend attributes the\r\nfoundation to St. Peter himself, who is believed to have dedicated this\r\nchurch to his Divine Master. History, however, can assign no earlier\r\nfoundation than that in 442, by the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Valentinian\r\nIII., from whom the church takes its name of the _Eudoxican Basilica_,\r\nand who placed there one of the famous chains which now form its great\r\nattraction to Roman Catholic pilgrims.\r\n\r\n     \"The chains, left in the Mamertine Prisons after St. Peter's\r\n     confinement there, are said to have been found by the martyr Sta.\r\n     Balbina, in 126, and by her given to Theodora, another sainted\r\n     martyr, sister to Hermes, Prefect of Rome, from whom they passed\r\n     into the hands of St. Alexander, first pope of that name, and were\r\n     finally deposited by him in the church erected by Theodora, where\r\n     they have since remained. Such is the legendary, but the historic\r\n     origin of this basilica cannot be traced higher than about the\r\n     middle of the fifth century, subsequent to the year 439, when\r\n     Juvenal, Bishop of Jerusalem, presented to the Empress Eudoxia,\r\n     wife of Theodosius the younger, two chains, believed to be those of\r\n     St. Peter, one of which was placed by her in the basilica of the\r\n     apostles at Constantinople, and the other sent to Rome for her\r\n     daughter Eudoxia, wife of Valentinian III., who caused this church,\r\n     hence called Eudoxian, to be erected, as the special shrine of\r\n     Peter's chains.\"--_Hemans._\r\n\r\nOne chain had been sent to Rome by Eudoxia the elder, and the other\r\nremained at Constantinople, but the Romans could not rest satisfied with\r\nthe possession of half the relic; and within the walls of this very\r\nbasilica, Leo I. beheld in a vision the miraculous and mystical uniting\r\nof the two chains, since which they have both been exhibited here, and\r\nthe day of their being soldered together by invisible power, August 1,\r\nhas been kept sacred in the Latin Church!\r\n\r\nThe church is at present entered by an ugly atrium, which was the work\r\nof Fontana in 1705; but Bacio Pintelli had already done almost all that\r\nwas possible to destroy the features of the old basilica, under the\r\nCardinal Titular of the church, Giulio della Rovere, the same who, as\r\nPope Julius II., destroyed the old St Peter's and eighty-seven tombs of\r\nhis predecessors. By Pintelli the present capitals were added to the\r\ncolumns in the nave, and the horizontal architrave above them was\r\nexchanged for a series of narrow round-headed arches.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of alterations, the interior is still imposing. Two long\r\nlines of ancient fluted Doric columns (ten on each side), relics of the\r\nBaths of Titus or Trajan, which once covered this site, lead the eye to\r\nthe high altar, supposed to cover the remains of the seven Maccabean\r\nbrothers, and to the tribune, which contains an ancient episcopal\r\nthrone, and is adorned with frescoes by _Jacopo Coppi_, a Florentine of\r\nthe sixteenth century, illustrative of the life of St. Peter. Beneath\r\nthese is the tomb of G. Clovis, a miniature painter of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and canon of this church.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the entrance is the tomb of Antonio Pollajuolo, the\r\nfamous worker in bronze, and his brother Pietro. The fresco above, which\r\nis ascribed to Pollajuolo, refers to the translation of the body of St.\r\nSebastian, as \"Depulsor Pestilitatis,\" from the catacombs to this\r\nchurch,--one of the most picturesque stories of the middle ages. The\r\ngreat plague of A.D. 680 was ushered in by an awful vision of the two\r\nangels of good and evil, who wandered through the streets by night, side\r\nby side, when the one smote upon the door where death was to enter,\r\nunless arrested by the other. The people continued to die by hundreds\r\ndaily. At length a citizen dreamt that the sickness would cease when the\r\nbody of St. Sebastian should be brought into the city, and when this was\r\ndone, the pestilence was stayed. In the fresco the whole story is told.\r\nIn the background the citizen tells his dream to Pope Agatho, who is\r\nseated among his cardinals. On the right the angels of good and evil\r\n(the bad angel represented as a devil) are making their mysterious\r\nvisitation, on the left a procession is bringing in the relics, and the\r\nforeground is strewn with the corpses of the dead. The general\r\ninvocation of St. Sebastian in Italy, and the frequent introduction of\r\nhis figure in art, have their origin in this story.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the left aisle is a fine bas-relief of St. Peter\r\nthroned, delivering his keys to an angel, who acknowledges his supremacy\r\nby receiving them on his knees. This work was executed in 1465, and\r\nserves as a monument to the Cardinal de Cusa, Bishop of Brixen, whose\r\nincised gravestone lies beneath.\r\n\r\nOver the second altar is a most interesting mosaic of 680, representing,\r\nin old age, the St. Sebastian whom we are accustomed to see as a\r\nbeautiful youth, wounded with arrows,--which he survived:--\r\n\r\n     \"A single figure in mosaic exists as an altar-piece in S. Pietro in\r\n     Vincoli. It is intended for St. Sebastian, who was removed to the\r\n     church by Pope Agathon, on occasion of the plague in 680, and\r\n     doubtless executed soon after this date. As a specimen of its kind\r\n     it is very remarkable. There is no analogy between this figure and\r\n     the usual youthful type of St. Sebastian which was subsequently\r\n     adopted. On the contrary, the saint is represented here as an old\r\n     man with white hair and beard, carrying the crown of martyrdom in\r\n     his hand, and dressed from head to foot in true Byzantine style. In\r\n     his countenance there is still some life and dignity. The more\r\n     careful shadowing also of the drapery shows that, in a work\r\n     intended to be so much exposed to the gaze of the pious, more pains\r\n     were bestowed than usual; nevertheless, the figure, upon the whole,\r\n     is very inanimate; the ground is blue.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nThe first altar in the right aisle has a picture of St. Augustine by\r\n_Guercino_; then come tombs of Cardinals Margotti and Agucci, from\r\ndesigns of _Domenichino_, who has introduced a portrait of the former in\r\nhis monument. At the end of this aisle is the beautiful picture of St.\r\nMargaret and the Dragon by _Guercino_; the saint is inspired, and\r\ndisplaying no sign of fear,--an earthly impulse only appearing in the\r\nmotion of her hand, which seems pushing back the dragon.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Margaret was daughter of a priest of Antioch named Theodosius,\r\n     and was brought up as a Christian by her nurse, whose sheep she\r\n     watched upon the hills, while meditating upon the mysteries of the\r\n     gospel. The governor of Antioch fell in love with her and wished to\r\n     marry her, but she refused, and declared herself a Christian. Her\r\n     friends thereupon deserted her, and the governor tried to subdue\r\n     her by submitting her to horrible tortures, amid which her faith\r\n     did not fail. She was then dragged to a dungeon, where Satan, in\r\n     the form of a terrible dragon, came upon her with his inflamed and\r\n     hideous mouth wide open, and sought to terrify and confound her;\r\n     but she held up the cross of the Redeemer, and he fled before it.\r\n     She finally suffered death by decapitation. Her legend was\r\n     certainly known in the fifth century: in the fourteenth century she\r\n     was one of the favourite saints, and was specially invoked by women\r\n     against the pains of child-birth.\r\n\r\n    \"'Mild Margarete, that was God's maide;\r\n    Maid Margarete, that was so meeke and milde.'\"\r\n\r\n    See _Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art_, v. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the glory of the church--the famous Moses of _Michael Angelo_,\r\nforming part of the decorations of the unfinished monument of Julius II.\r\n\r\n     \"This pope, whom nature had intended for a conqueror, and destiny\r\n     clothed with the robe of a priest, takes his place by the side of\r\n     the great warriors of the sixteenth century, by the side of Charles\r\n     V., of Francis I., of Gonsalvo, of Cortes, of Alba, of Bayard, and\r\n     of Doria. It is difficult to imagine Julius II. murmuring prayers,\r\n     or saying mass in pontifical robes, and performing, in the midst of\r\n     all those unmanly functions and thousand passive forms, the\r\n     spirit-deadening part which is assigned to the popes, while his\r\n     soul was on fire with great-hearted designs, and while in the music\r\n     of the psalms he seemed to hear the thunder of cannon. He wished to\r\n     be a prince of the Church; and with the political instinct of a\r\n     prince he founded his state in the midst of the most difficult wars\r\n     against France, and unhesitatingly conquered and took possession of\r\n     Bologna, Piacenza, Parma, Reggio, and Urbino....\r\n\r\n     The greatest pope since Innocent III., and the creator of a new\r\n     political spirit in the papacy, he wished, as a second Augustus, to\r\n     glorify himself and his creation. He took up again the projects of\r\n     Nicholas V. Rome should become his monument. To carry out his\r\n     designs he found the genius of Bramante and Raphael, and, above\r\n     all, that of Michael Angelo, who belonged to him like an organ of\r\n     his being. St. Peter's, of which he laid the foundation-stone, the\r\n     paintings of the Sistine, the loggie of Bramante, the stanze of\r\n     Raphael, are memorials of Julius the Second.\"--_Gregorovius,\r\n     Grabmaler der Papste._\r\n\r\nMost of all Julius II. sought immortality in his tomb, for which the\r\noriginal design was absolutely gigantic. Eighteen feet high, and twelve\r\nwide, it was intended to contain more than forty statues, which were to\r\ninclude Moses, St. Peter and St. Paul, Rachel and Leah, and chained\r\nfigures of the Provinces, while those of the Heaven and the Earth were\r\nto support the sarcophagus of the pope. This project was cut short by\r\nthe death of Julius in 1513, when only four of the statues were\r\nfinished, and eight designed.[261] Of those which were finished, three\r\nstatues, the Moses, the Rachel, and the Leah, were afterwards used for\r\nthe existing memorial, which was put together under Paul III. by the\r\nDuke of Urbino, heir of Julius II.--in this church of which his uncle\r\nhad been a cardinal.\r\n\r\n     \"The eye does not know where to rest in this the masterpiece of\r\n     sculpture since the time of the Greeks. It seems to be as much an\r\n     incarnation of the genius of Michael Angelo, as a suitable allegory\r\n     of Pope Julius. Like Moses, he was at once lawgiver, priest, and\r\n     warrior. The figure is seated in the central niche, with\r\n     long-flowing beard descending to the waist, with horned head, and\r\n     deep-sunk eyes, which blaze, as it were, with the light of the\r\n     burning bush, with a majesty of anger which makes one tremble, as\r\n     of a passionate being, drunken with fire. All that is positive and\r\n     all that is negative in him is equally dreadful. If he were to\r\n     rise up, it seems as if he would shout forth laws which no human\r\n     intellect could fathom, and which, instead of improving the world,\r\n     would drive it back into chaos. His voice, like that of the gods of\r\n     Homer, would thunder forth in tones too awful for the ear of man to\r\n     support. Yes! there is something infinite which lies in the Moses\r\n     of Michael Angelo. Nor is his countenance softened by the twilight\r\n     of sadness, which is stealing from his forehead over his eyes. It\r\n     is the same deep sadness which clouded the countenance of Michael\r\n     Angelo himself. But here it is less touching than terrible. The\r\n     Greeks could not have endured a glance from such a Moses, and the\r\n     artist would certainly have been blamed, because he had thrown no\r\n     softening touch over his gigantic picture. That which we have is\r\n     the archetype of a terrible and quite unapproachable sublimity.\r\n     This statue might take its place in the cell of a colossal temple,\r\n     as that of Jupiter Ammon, but the tomb where it is placed is so\r\n     little suited to it, that regarded even only as its frame it is too\r\n     small.\"--_Gregorovius._\r\n\r\nOn either side of the principal figure are niches containing Michael\r\nAngelo's statues of Rachel and Leah,--emblematic of active and\r\ncontemplative life. Those above, of the Prophet and the Sibyl, are by\r\nRaphael da Montelupo, his best pupil; on the summit is the Madonna with\r\nthe Infant Jesus by Scherano da Settignano. The worst figure of the\r\nwhole is that, by Maso dal Bosco, of the pope himself, who seems quite\r\noverwhelmed by the grandeur of his companions, and who lies upon a\r\npitiful sarcophagus, leaning his head upon his hand, and looking down\r\nupon the Moses. He is represented with the beard which he was the first\r\npope to reintroduce after an interval of many centuries,--and it is said\r\nto have been from his example that Francis I., Charles V., and others,\r\nadopted it also.\r\n\r\nAfter all, Julius II. was not buried here, and the tomb is merely\r\ncommemorative. He rests beneath a plain marble slab near his uncle\r\nSixtus IV., in the chapel of the Sacrament at St. Peter's.\r\n\r\nClose to the Moses is the entrance to the chapel in which the chains are\r\npreserved, behind a bronze screen--the work of Pollajuolo. They are of\r\nunequal size, owing to many fragments of one of them (first whole links,\r\nthen only filings) having been removed in the course of centuries by\r\nvarious popes and sent to Christian princes who have been esteemed\r\nworthy of the favour![262] The longest is about five feet in length. At\r\nthe end of one of them is a collar, which is said to have encircled the\r\nneck of St. Peter. They are exposed on the day of the \"station\" (the\r\nfirst Monday in Lent) in a reliquary presented by Pius IX., adorned with\r\nstatuettes of St. Peter and the angel--to whom he is represented as\r\nsaying, \"Ecce nunc scio vere.\"[263] On the following day a priest gives\r\nthe chains to be kissed by the pilgrims, and touches their foreheads\r\nwith them, saying, \"By the intercession of the blessed Apostle Peter,\r\nmay God preserve you from evil. Amen.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Peter, therefore, was kept in prison: but prayer was made without\r\n     ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when Herod would have\r\n     brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two\r\n     soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door\r\n     kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him,\r\n     and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side,\r\n     and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell\r\n     off from his hands.\"--_Acts_ xii. 5--7.\r\n\r\nOther relics preserved here are portions of the crosses of St. Peter and\r\nSt. Andrew, and the body of Sta. Costanza.\r\n\r\nThe sacristy, opening out of this chapel, contains a number of pictures,\r\nincluding, very appropriately, the Deliverance of St. Peter from Prison,\r\nby _Domenichino_. Here, till a few years ago, was preserved the famous\r\nand beautiful small picture, known as the Speranza of _Guido_. It has\r\nlately been sold by the monks to an Englishman, and is replaced by a\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nIn this church Hildebrand was crowned pope as Gregory VII. (1073).\r\nStephen IX. was also proclaimed here in 939. The adjoining convent was\r\nbuilt from designs of Giuliano San Gallo. Its courtyard contains a\r\npicturesque well (with columns), bearing the arms of Julius II., by\r\n_Simone Mosca_. The arcades were decorated in the present century with\r\nfrescoes by _Pietra Camosci_, as a votive offering for his recovery from\r\ncholera, to St. Sebastian, \"depulsori pestilitatis.\"\r\n\r\nOpposite S. Pietro in Vincoli is a convent of Maronite monks, in whose\r\ngarden is a tall palm-tree, perhaps the finest in Rome. In the view from\r\nthe portico of the church it forms a conspicuous feature, and the\r\ncombination of the old tower, the palm-tree, and the distant capitol,\r\nstanding out against the golden sky of sunset, is one very familiar to\r\nRoman artists.\r\n\r\nThe tall machicolated _Tower_ on the right was once a fortress of the\r\nFrangipani family, who obtained their glorious surname of\r\n\"bread-breakers\" from the generosity which they showed in the\r\ndistribution of food to the poor during a famine in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The tower is now used as a belfry to the adjoining Church of\r\n_S. Francesco di Paola_, being the only mediæval fortress tower applied\r\nto this purpose. The adjoining building is known as the _House of\r\nLucrezia Borgia_, and the balcony over the gateway on the other side is\r\npointed out as that in which she used to stand meditating on her crimes.\r\nHere Cæsar Borgia and his unhappy brother, the Duke of Gandia, supped\r\nwith Lucrezia and their mother Vanozza, the evening before the murder of\r\nthe duke, of which Cæsar was accused by popular belief. It is worth\r\nwhile to descend under the low-browed arch from the church piazza, and\r\nlook back upon this lofty house, with its steep, dark, winding\r\nstaircase,--a most picturesque bit of street architecture, which looks\r\nbetter the further you descend. The Via S. Francesco di Paola is\r\nconsidered by Ampère[264] to have been the place where the house of the\r\nHoratii and the Tigellum Sororis once stood.\r\n\r\nFollowing the narrow lane behind S. Pietro, we reach, on the left, _S.\r\nMartino al Monte_, the great church of the Carmelites, which, though of\r\nuninviting exterior, is of the highest interest. It was built in A.D.\r\n500 by S. Symmachus, and dedicated to the saints Sylvestro and Martino,\r\non the site of an older church founded by St. Sylvester in the time of\r\nConstantine. After repeated alterations, it was modernised in 1650 by P.\r\nFilippini, General of the Carmelites. The nave is separated from the\r\naisles by twenty-four ancient Corinthian columns. The aisles are painted\r\nwith landscapes by _Gaspar Poussin_, having figures introduced by his\r\nbrother Nicholas. The roof is an addition by S. Carlo Borromeo.\r\n\r\nThe pillars of different marbles are magnificent, and the effect of the\r\nraised choir, with winding staircases to the crypt below, is highly\r\npicturesque. On the walls are frescoes by _Cavaluccio_ (ob. 1795), who\r\nis buried in the left aisle. The collection of incised gravestones\r\ndeserves attention, they comprise those of a knight in mail armour of\r\n1349; Cardinal Diomede Caraffa, with a curious epitaph; and various\r\ngenerals and remarkable monks of the Carmelite Order. Beneath the high\r\naltar rest the bodies of Popes Sergius, Sylvester, Martin I., Fabian,\r\nStephen I., Soter, Ciriacus, Anastasius, and Innocent I., with several\r\nsaints not papal, removed hither from the catacombs. In the curious\r\ncrypt, part of the Baths of Titus, the early Council of Sylvester and\r\nConstantine was held, as represented in the fresco in the left aisle of\r\nthe upper church. The back of the ancient chair of Sylvester still\r\nremains, green with age and damp. In the chapel on the left, where St.\r\nSylvester used to celebrate mass, is an ancient mosaic of the Madonna.\r\nIn front of the papal chair is the grand sepulchral figure of a\r\nCarmelite, who was General of the Order in the time of Sta. Teresa. An\r\nurn contains the intestines of the \"Beato,\" Cardinal Giuseppe-Maria de\r\nTommasis, who died in 1713. His body is preserved beneath an altar in\r\nthe left aisle of the upper church, and is dressed in his cardinal's\r\nrobes.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1650 was reopened, beneath SS. Martino e Sylvestro, the\r\n     long-forgotten oratory formed (according to Anastasius) by\r\n     Sylvester among the halls of Trajan's Thermæ--or, more probably, in\r\n     an antique palace adjacent to those imperial baths--and called by\r\n     Christian writers 'Titulus Equitii,' from the name of a Roman\r\n     priest then proprietor of the ground. Now a gloomy, time-worn, and\r\n     sepulchral subterranean, this structure is in form an extensive\r\n     quadrangle, under a high-hung vault, divided into four aisles by\r\n     massive square piers; the central bay of one aisle adorned with a\r\n     large red cross, painted as if studded with gems; and ranged round\r\n     this, four books, each within a nimbus, earliest symbolism to\r\n     represent the Evangelists. Among the much-faded and dim-seen\r\n     frescoes on these dusky walls, are figures of the Saviour between\r\n     SS. Peter and Paul, besides other saints, each crowned by a large\r\n     nimbus.\"--_Hemans' Ancient Sacred Art._\r\n\r\nHere is preserved a mitre, probably the most ancient extant, and said to\r\nbe that of St. Sylvester, who lived in the fourth century, and who was\r\nthe first Latin bishop to wear the mitre originally worn by the priests\r\nof pagan temples. This ancient mitre is so low as to rise only just\r\nabove the crown of the head.\r\n\r\nThis church was dedicated to St. Martin, the holy Bishop of Tours,\r\nwithin a hundred years after his death, showing the very early\r\nveneration with which that saint was regarded.\r\n\r\nLeaving S. Martino by the other door, near the tribune, we emerge at the\r\ntop of the steep street called _Sta. Lucia in Selci_, which is the same\r\nwith that described by Martial in going to visit the younger Pliny as--\r\n\r\n    \"Altum vincere tramitem Suburræ.\" _Lib._ x. _Ep._ 19, 5.\r\n\r\nAnd again--\r\n\r\n    \"Alto Suburrani vincenda est semita clivi.\" _Lib._ v. _Ep._ 23, 5.\r\n\r\nHere is a whole group of convents. In the hollow is the convent of S.\r\nFrancesco di Paola, with several others. Just above (in the Via Quattro\r\nCantone) is the convent of the Oratorians, or S. Filippo Neri. At this\r\npoint also are two mediæval towers, one enclosed within the convent\r\nwalls of Sta. Lucia in Selci, the other on the opposite side of the\r\nstreet, supposed by some to be the tower of Mecænas, celebrated by\r\nHorace. On the left of the street is the house of Domenichino (Domenico\r\nZampieri), whose residence here is commemorated by an inscription.\r\n\r\nMounting the street we soon reach, on the right, the picturesque tenth\r\ncentury west gate (a high narrow arch upon Ionic columns, modernized and\r\nplastered over under the Sardinian government) of the _Church of Sta.\r\nPrassede_, which leads into the atrium of the church. This is seldom\r\nopen, but we can enter by a door in the north aisle.\r\n\r\nSta. Prassede was sister of Sta. Pudenziana, and daughter of Pudens and\r\nhis wife Claudia, with whom St. Paul lodged, and who were among his\r\nfirst converts (see Ch. X., Sta. Pudenziana). She gave shelter in her\r\nhouse to a number of persecuted Christians, twenty-three of whom were\r\ndiscovered and martyred in her presence. She then buried their bodies in\r\nthe catacombs of her grandmother, Sta. Priscilla, but, collecting their\r\nblood in a sponge, placed it in a well in her own house, where she was\r\nafterwards buried herself. An oratory is said to have been erected on\r\nthe site by Pius I., A.D. 160, and was certainly in existence in A.D.\r\n499, when it is mentioned in the acts of a Council. In A.D. 822 the\r\noriginal church was destroyed, and the present church erected by Pascal\r\nI., of whose time are the low tower, the porch, the terra-cotta\r\ncornices, and the mosaics. During the absence of the popes at Avignon,\r\nSta. Prassede was one of the many churches which fell almost into ruin,\r\nand it has since suffered terribly from injudicious modernisations,\r\nfirst in the fifteenth century from Rosellini, under Nicholas V., and\r\nafterwards under S. Carlo Borromeo in 1564.\r\n\r\nThe interior is a basilica, the nave being separated from the aisles by\r\nsixteen granite columns, many of which have been boxed up in hideous\r\nstucco pilasters, decorated with frescoes of apostles; but their\r\nCorinthian capitals are visible, carved with figures of birds (the\r\neagle, cock, and dove) in strong relief against the acanthus leaves. The\r\nnave is divided into four compartments by arches rising from the square\r\npilasters; the roof is coffered.\r\n\r\nIn the right aisle is the entrance to the famous chapel, called, from\r\nits unusual and mysterious splendour, the _Orto del\r\nParadiso_--originally dedicated to S. Zeno, then to the Virgin, with the\r\ninvocation \"Libera nos a pœnis inferi,\" and finally to the great\r\nrelic which it contains. Females are never allowed to enter this shrine\r\nexcept upon Sundays in Lent, but can see the relic through a grating.\r\nMales are admitted by the door which is flanked by two columns of rare\r\nblack and white marble, supporting a richly-sculptured marble cornice,\r\nabove which are two lines of mosaic heads in circlets--in the outer, the\r\nSaviour and the twelve apostles; in the inner, the Virgin between St.\r\nStephen and St. Laurence, with eight female saints; at the angles St.\r\nPudens and St. Pastor. In the interior of the chapel four granite\r\ncolumns support a lofty groined vault, which, together with the upper\r\npart of the walls, is entirely covered with mosaic figures, which stand\r\nout distinctly from a gold ground.\r\n\r\n     \"Here are SS. Peter and Paul before a throne, on which is the\r\n     cross, but no seated figure; the former apostle holding a single\r\n     gold key,[265] the latter a scroll; St. John the Evangelist, with a\r\n     richly-bound volume; SS. James and Andrew, the two daughters of\r\n     Pudens, and St. Agnes, all in rich vestments, and holding crowns;\r\n     the Virgin Mary (a veiled matronly figure), and St. John the\r\n     Baptist standing beside her; under the arch of a window, another\r\n     half-figure of Mary, with three other females, all having the\r\n     nimbus, one crowned, one with a square halo to indicate a person\r\n     still living; above these, the Divine Lamb on a hill, from which\r\n     the four rivers issue, with stags drinking of their waters; above\r\n     the altar, the Saviour, between four other saints,--figures in part\r\n     barbarously sacrificed to a modern tabernacle that conceals them.\r\n     On the vault a colossal half-figure of the Saviour, youthful but\r\n     severe in aspect, with cruciform nimbus, appears in a large\r\n     circular halo supported by four archangels, solemn forms in long\r\n     white vestments, that stand finely distinct in the dim light.\r\n     Within a niche over the altar is another mosaic of the Virgin and\r\n     Child, with the two daughters of Pudens, in which Rumohr\r\n     (Italienische Forsch.) observes ruder execution, indicating origin\r\n     later than the ninth century.\"--_Hemans' Ancient Christian Art._\r\n\r\nThe relic preserved here (one of the principal objects of pilgrimage in\r\nRome) is the column to which our Saviour is reputed to have been bound,\r\nsaid to have been given by the Saracens to Giovanni Colonna, cardinal of\r\nthis church, and legate of the crusade, because, when he had fallen into\r\ntheir hands and was about to be put to death, he was rescued by a\r\nmarvellous intervention of celestial light. Its being of the rarest\r\nblood jasper is a reason against its authenticity; the peculiarity of\r\nits formation having even given rise to the mineralogical term, \"Granito\r\ndella Colonna.\" A disk of porphyry in the pavement marks the grave of\r\nforty martyrs collected by Paschal I. The mother of that pope is also\r\nburied here, and the inscription commemorating her observes an ancient\r\necclesiastical usage in allowing her the title of \"episcopa:\" \"_Ubi\r\nutique benignissimæ suæ genitricis, scilicet Dominæ Theodoræ, Episcopæ\r\ncorpus quiescit._\" In this chapel Paschal I. saw the spirit of his\r\nnephew dragged to heaven by an angel, through the little window, while\r\nhe was saying a mass for his soul.\r\n\r\nThe high altar covers the entrance to a small crypt, in which are two\r\nancient sarcophagi, containing the remains of the sainted sisters\r\nPrassede and Pudenziana. An altar here, richly decorated with mosaic, is\r\nshown as that which existed in the house of Prassede. Above is a fresco,\r\nreferred to the twelfth century, representing the Madonna between the\r\nsainted sisters. At the end of the left aisle is a large slab of granite\r\n(nero-bianco), upon which Sta. Prassede is said to have slept, and above\r\nit a picture of her asleep. In the centre of the nave is the well where\r\nshe collected the blood, with a hideous statue of her squeezing it out\r\nof a sponge.\r\n\r\nThe chapel at the end of the left aisle is that of S. Carlo Borromeo,\r\nwho was cardinal of this church, and contains his episcopal throne (a\r\nwooden chair) and a table, at which, like St. Gregory, he used to feed\r\nand wait upon twelve poor men daily. The pictures in this chapel, by\r\n_Louis Stern_, represent S. Carlo in prayer, and in ecstasy before the\r\nSacrament. In the cloister is an old orange-tree which was planted by\r\nhim, but is still flourishing.\r\n\r\nOpposite the side entrance of the Orto del Paradiso is the tomb of\r\nCardinal Cetive (1474), with his sleeping figure and statuettes of SS.\r\nPeter and Paul, Sta. Prassede, and Sta. Pudenziana. This will recall\r\nBrowning's quaint forcible poem of 'The Bishop who orders his tomb at\r\nSaint Praxed's church.'\r\n\r\n    \"Saint Praxed's ever was the church for peace.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And there how I shall lie through centuries,\r\n    And hear the blessed mutter of the mass,\r\n    And see God made and eaten all day long,\r\n    And feel the steady candle flame, and taste\r\n    Good strong thick stupefying incense-smoke!\"\r\n\r\nOther tombs of interest are those of Cardinal Ancherus, assassinated in\r\n1286 outside the Porta S. Giovanni, and of Monsignor Santoni, a bust,\r\nsaid to have been executed by Bernini when only ten years old.\r\n\r\nTwo pictures in side chapels are interesting in a Vallombrosan church,\r\nas connected with saints of that order,--one representing S. Pietro\r\nAldobrandini passing through the furnace at Settimo; and another the\r\nmartyrdom of Cardinal Beccaria, put to death at Florence (whither he was\r\nsent by Alexander IV. to make peace between the Guelfs and\r\nGhibellines)--and consigned to hell by Dante.\r\n\r\n       ----\"Quel di Beccaria\r\n    Di cui segò Fiorenza la gorgiera.\"\r\n\r\n    _Inferno_, xxxii.\r\n\r\nSteps of magnificent rosso-antico lead to the tribune, which is covered\r\nwith mosaics of A.D. 817-824. Those on the arch represent the heavenly\r\nJerusalem; within is the Saviour with a cruciform halo--the hand of the\r\nfirst person of the Trinity holding a crown over his head--and St. Peter\r\nand St. Paul bringing in the sainted sisters of the church; on the\r\nright, Pope Paschal I.,[266] with a model of his church; on the left,\r\nSt. Zeno (?). Above these figures, is the Adoration of the spotless\r\nLamb, and beneath their feet the Jordan; below all is the Lamb again,\r\nwith the twelve sheep issuing from the mystic cities of Jerusalem and\r\nBethlehem, and verses recording the work of Paschal I.\r\n\r\n     \"The arrangement of saints at Sta. Prassede (817) is altogether\r\n     different from that at Ravenna, but equally striking. Over the\r\n     grand arch which separates the choir from the nave is a mosaic,\r\n     representing the New Jerusalem, as described in the Revelations. It\r\n     is a walled enclosure, with a gate at each end, guarded by angels.\r\n     Within is seen the Saviour of the World, holding in his hand the\r\n     orb of sovereignty, and a company of blessed seated on thrones:\r\n     outside, the noble army of martyrs is seen approaching, conducted\r\n     and received by angels. They are all arrayed in white, and carry\r\n     crowns in their hands. Lower down, on each side, a host of martyrs\r\n     press forward with palms and crowns, to do homage to the Lamb,\r\n     throned in the midst. None of the martyrs are distinguished by\r\n     name, except those to whom the church is dedicated--Sta. Prassede\r\n     and her sister Pudenziana.\"--_Mrs. Jameson._\r\n\r\nWhile Pope Gelasius II. was celebrating mass in this church, he was\r\nattacked by armed bands of the inimical houses of Leone and Frangipani,\r\nand was only rescued by the assistance of his nephew Gaetano, after a\r\nconflict of some hours. Hence in 1630, Moriandi, abbot of Sta.\r\nPrassede, was suddenly carried off and put to fearful tortures, which\r\nresulted in his death, ostensibly on account of irregularities in his\r\nconvent, but really because he had been heard to speak against Urban\r\nVIII.[267]\r\n\r\nIn the sacristy is preserved a fine picture by Giulio Romano of the\r\nFlagellation--especially appropriate in the church of the Colonna.\r\n\r\nHence the curious campanile of the old church (built 1110) may be\r\nentered, and a loggia whence the great relics of the church are\r\nexhibited at Easter, including: portions of the crown of thorns, of the\r\nsponge, of the Virgin's hair, and a miniature portrait of our Saviour\r\nwhich is said to have belonged to St. Peter and to have been left by him\r\nwith the daughters of Pudens.\r\n\r\nThe _Monastery_ attached to the church, founded by Paschal I., was first\r\noccupied by Basilian, but since 1198 has belonged to Vallombrosan monks.\r\nNothing remains of the mosaic-covered chapel of St. Agnes, built by the\r\nfounder within its walls.\r\n\r\nWhere the Via Sta. Prassede crosses the road leading from Sta. Maria\r\nMaggiore to the Lateran, is the modern gothic church of _Il Santissimo\r\nRedentore_, built by Father Douglas within the last few years.\r\n\r\nA little beyond this, attached to the Church of S. Vito, from which it\r\nhas sometimes been named, is the _Arch of Gallienus_ (supposed to occupy\r\nthe site of the Esquiline gate in the wall of Servius), dedicated to\r\nGallienus (A.D. 253--260) and his Empress Salonina, by Marcus Aurelius\r\nVictor, evidently a court-flatterer of the period, who was prefect of\r\nRome, and possessed gardens on this spot. It is of very inferior\r\nexecution; the original plan had three arches; only that in the centre\r\nremains, but traces of another may be seen on the side next the church.\r\nGallienus was a cruel and self-indulgent emperor, who excited the\r\nindignation of the Romans by leaving his old father, Valerian, to die a\r\ncaptive in the hands of the Persians, so that the inscription,\r\n\"_Clementissimo principi cuius invicta virtus sola pietate superata\r\nest_,\" is singularly false, even for the time.\r\n\r\n     \"Il arrivait à Gallien de faire tuer trois ou quatre mille soldats\r\n     en un jour, et il écrivait des lettres comme celle-ci, adressée à\r\n     un de ses généraux: 'Tu n'auras pas fait assez pour moi, si tu ne\r\n     mets à mort que des hommes armés, car le sort de la guerre aurait\r\n     pu les faire périr. Il faut tuer quiconque a eu une intention\r\n     mauvaise, quiconque a mal parlé de moi. Déchire, tue, extermine:\r\n     _lacera, occide, concide_.' Entré dans Byzance en promettant leur\r\n     pardon aux troupes qui avaient combattu contre lui, il les fit\r\n     égorger, et les soldats ravagèrent la ville au point qu'il n'y\r\n     resta pas un habitant. Voilà pour la clémence. Tandis que Valérien,\r\n     son père, était prisonnier du roi des Perses Sapor, qui pour monter\r\n     à cheval se servait du dos du vieil empereur comme d'un marchepied,\r\n     en attendant qu'il le fit empailler, l'indigne fils de Valérien\r\n     vivait au sein des plus honteuses voluptés, et ne tentait pas un\r\n     seul effort pour le délivrer. Voilà pour la vaillance et la\r\n     piété.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 334.\r\n\r\nClose to this Gallienus had ordered a statue of himself to be erected,\r\nwhich was to be double the height of the colossus of Nero, but it was\r\nunfinished at the time of his death, and destroyed by his successor.\r\nFrom the centre of the arch hung, from the thirteenth century, the chain\r\nand keys of the gates of Viterbo, removed at the same time as the great\r\nbell of the Capitol. These interesting memorials of middle-age warfare\r\nwere taken down in 1825.\r\n\r\nPassing under the arch we enter upon the Via Maggiore, the main artery\r\nleading to Santa Croce. On the left is the humble convent of the\r\n_Monache Polacche_, where the long-suffering Madre Makrena, the sole\r\nsurvivor of the terrible persecution of the nuns of Minsk, has lived in\r\nthe closest retirement since her escape in 1845.\r\n\r\n     The story of the cruel sufferings of the Polish-Basilian nuns of\r\n     Minsk reminds one of the worst persecutions of the early\r\n     Christians, under Nero and Diocletian. Makrena Miaczylslawska was\r\n     abbess of a convent of thirty-eight nuns, whom the apostate bishop\r\n     Siemasko first tried to compel to the Greek faith in the summer of\r\n     1838. Their refusal led to their being driven, laden with chains,\r\n     to Witepsk, in Siberia, where they were forced to hard labour, many\r\n     of them being beaten to death, one roasted alive in a hot stove,\r\n     and another having her brains beaten out with a stake by the abbess\r\n     of the Czernice (apostate nuns), on their persisting in their\r\n     refusal to change their religion. In 1840 the surviving nuns were\r\n     removed to Polock, where they were forced to work at building a\r\n     palace for the bishop Siemasko, and where nine of them perished by\r\n     a falling scaffold, and many others expired under the heavy weights\r\n     they were compelled to carry, or under the lash. In 1842 their\r\n     tortures were increased tenfold, eight of the sisters having their\r\n     eyes torn out, and others being trodden to death. In 1843 those who\r\n     still survived were removed to Miadzioly, where the \"protopope\r\n     Skrykin\" said that he would \"drown them like puppies,\" and where\r\n     they were dragged by boats through the shallows of the half-frozen\r\n     Dwina, up to their necks in water, till many died of the cold. In\r\n     the spring of 1845, Makrena, with the only three nuns who survived\r\n     with the use of their limbs (Eusebia Wawrzecka, Clotilda Konarska,\r\n     and Irene Pomarnacka,) scaled the walls of their prison, while the\r\n     priests and nuns who guarded them were lying drunk after an orgie,\r\n     and, after wandering for three months in the forests of Lithuania,\r\n     made good their escape. The nuns remained in Vienna; the abbess,\r\n     after a series of extraordinary adventures, arrived in Rome, where\r\n     she was at first lodged in the convent of the Trinità de' Monti.\r\n     The story of the nuns of Minsk was taken down from her dictation at\r\n     the same time by a number of eminent ecclesiastics, authorized by\r\n     the pope, and the authenticity of her statements verified; after\r\n     which she retired into complete seclusion in the Polish convent on\r\n     the Esquiline, where she has long filled the humble office of\r\n     portress. Her legs are eaten into the bone by the chains she wore\r\n     in her prison life. The story of the persecution at Minsk may be\r\n     read in \"Le Récit de Makrena Miaczylslawska,\" published at Paris,\r\n     by Lecoffre, in 1846; in a paper by Charles Dickens, in the\r\n     \"Household Words,\" for May, 1854; and in \"Pictures of Christian\r\n     Heroism,\" 1855.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite this convent is the picturesque ruin of a nymphæum,\r\nprobably of the time of Septimius Severus, erroneously called _The\r\nTrophies of Marius_, from the trophies, now on the terrace in front of\r\nthe Capitol, which were found here.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, on the right, is the entrance of the _Villa Palombara_,\r\noccupying a great part of the site of the Baths of Titus.\r\n\r\n     \"This villa once belonged to Queen Christina of Sweden, who has\r\n     left upon the little doorway exactly opposite the ruin called the\r\n     Trophies of Marius, a curious record of her credulity. It consists\r\n     of a collection of unintelligible words, signs, and triangles,\r\n     given her by some alchymist, as the rule to make gold, and which,\r\n     no doubt, he had found successful, having obtained from her, and\r\n     probably from many other votaries, abundance of that precious metal\r\n     in exchange for it. But as she could make nothing of it, she caused\r\n     it to be inscribed here, in case any passenger, wiser than herself,\r\n     should be able to develope the mystic signs of this golden\r\n     secret.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nThough the existing ruin is misnamed, the trophies erected in honour of\r\nthe victories which Marius gained over the Cimbri were really set up\r\nnear this; and, curiously enough, on this site also Marius was defeated\r\nat the \"Forum Esquilinum\" by Sylla, who suddenly descended upon Rome\r\nfrom Nola with six legions, and entering by the Porta Esquilina, met his\r\nadversary here, and forced him to fly to Ostia.\r\n\r\nBehind the Trophies of Marius a lane branches off on the left to the\r\ndesolate _Church of Sta. Bibiana_.\r\n\r\n     In the time of Julian the Apostate, there dwelt in Rome a Christian\r\n     unity, consisting of Flavian, his wife Dalfrosa, and his two\r\n     daughters, Bibiana and Demetria. All these died for their faith.\r\n     Flavian was exiled, and died of starvation; Dalfrosa was beheaded;\r\n     the sisters were imprisoned (A.D. 362) and scourged, and Demetria\r\n     died at once under the torture. Bibiana glorified God by longer\r\n     sufferings. Apronius, the prefect of the city, astonished by her\r\n     beauty, conceived a guilty passion for her, and placed her under\r\n     the care of one of his creatures named Rufina, who was gradually to\r\n     bend her to his will. But Bibiana repelled his proposals with\r\n     horror, and her firmness excited him to such fury, that he\r\n     commanded her to be bound to a column, and scourged to compliance.\r\n     \"The order was executed with all imaginable cruelty, rivers of\r\n     blood flowed from each wound, and morsels of flesh were torn away,\r\n     till even the most barbarous spectators were stricken with horror.\r\n     The saint alone continued immoveable, with her eyes fixed upon\r\n     heaven, and her countenance radiant with celestial peace,--until\r\n     her body being torn to pieces, her soul escaped to her heavenly\r\n     bridegroom, to receive the double crown of virginity and\r\n     martyrdom.\"[268]\r\n\r\n     After the death of Bibiana, her body was exposed to dogs for three\r\n     days in the Forum Boarium, but remained unmolested; after which it\r\n     was stolen at night by John the priest, who buried it here.\r\n\r\nThe church, founded in the fifth century by Olympia, a Roman matron, was\r\nmodernised by Bernini for Urban VIII., and has no external appearance of\r\nantiquity. The interior is adorned with frescoes; those on the right are\r\nby _Agostino Ciampelli_, those on the left are considered by Lanzi as\r\nthe best works of _Pietro da Cortona_. They pourtray in detail the story\r\nof the saint:--\r\n\r\n    1. Bibiana refuses to sacrifice to idols.\r\n    2. The death of Demetria.\r\n    3. Bibiana is scourged at the column.\r\n    4. The body of Bibiana is watched over by a dog.\r\n    5. Olympia founds the church, which is dedicated by Pope Simplicius.\r\n\r\nThe statue of the saint at the high altar is considered the masterpiece\r\nof _Bernini_. It is dignified and graceful, and would hardly be\r\nrecognised as his work.\r\n\r\n     \"This statue is one of his earliest works; and it is said that when\r\n     Bernini, in advanced life, returned from France, he uttered, on\r\n     seeing it, an involuntary expression of admiration. 'But,' added\r\n     he, 'had I always worked in this style, I should have been a\r\n     beggar.' This would lead us to conclude, that his own taste led him\r\n     to prefer simplicity and truth, but that he was obliged to conform\r\n     to the corrupted predilection of the age.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nThe remains of the saint are preserved beneath the altar, in a splendid\r\nsarcophagus of oriental alabaster, adorned with a leopard's head. A\r\ncolumn of rosso-antico is shown as that to which Sta. Bibiana was bound\r\nduring her flagellation. The _fête_ of the martyred sisters is observed\r\nwith great solemnity on December 2.\r\n\r\n     \"Il est touchant de voir, le jour de la fête, le Chapitre entier de\r\n     la grande et somptueuse basilique de Sainte-Marie-Majeure venir\r\n     processionellement à cette modeste église et célébrer de\r\n     solennelles et pompeuses cérémonies en l'honneur de ces deux\r\n     vierges et leur mère: C'est que si ces trois femmes étaient faibles\r\n     et ignorées selon le monde, elles sont devenues par leur foi,\r\n     fortes et sublimes; et l'Église ne croit pouvoir trop faire pour\r\n     glorifier une pareille grandeur.\"--_Impressions d'une Catholique à\r\n     Rome._\r\n\r\nOn or near this site were the _Horti Lamiani_, in which the Emperor\r\nCaligula was hastily buried after his assassination, A.D. 41, though his\r\nremains were shortly afterwards disinterred by his sisters and burnt.\r\nThese gardens were probably the property of Ælius Lamia, to whom Horace\r\naddressed one of his odes.[269] At an earlier period Elius Tubero lived\r\nhere, celebrated for his virtue, his poverty, and his little house,\r\nwhere sixteen members of the Elian Gens dwelt harmoniously\r\ntogether.[270] He married the daughter of L. Emilius Paulus, \"who,\" says\r\nPlutarch, \"though the daughter of one who had twice been consul and\r\ntwice triumphed, did not blush for the poverty of her husband, but\r\nadmired the virtue which had made him poor.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Trophies of Marius, the Via Porta Maggiore\r\nleads to the gate of that name (see Ch. XIII.). Approached by a gate on\r\nthe left of this road, most desolate, until the making of the railway\r\namid its vineyards and gardens, and crowned with lentiscus and other\r\nshrubs, is the picturesque ruin generally called the _Temple of Minerva\r\nMedica_, from a false impression that the Giustiniani Minerva, now in\r\nthe Vatican, had been found here.[271] It is now generally decided to be\r\na remnant of the bath built by Augustus in honour of his grandsons Caius\r\nand Lucius Cæsar (sons of Agrippa and Julia). It is a decagon, with a\r\nvaulted brick roof, and nine niches for statues; those of Æsculapius,\r\nAntinous, Hercules, Adonis, Pomona, and (the Farnese) Faun, have been\r\nfound on the site.\r\n\r\nNear this is a curious _Columbarium of the Arruntia Family_, and a\r\nbrick-lined hollow, supposed to be part of the Naumachia which Dion\r\nCassius says that Augustus constructed \"in the grove of Caius and\r\nLucius.\"\r\n\r\nJust where the lane turns off to Sta. Bibiana is the entrance to the\r\ncourtyard of the _Church and Monastery of S. Eusebio_, built upon the\r\nsite of the house of the saint, a priest of noble family, martyred by\r\nstarvation under Constantius, A.D. 357. His body rests under the high\r\naltar, with that of St. Orosus, a Spanish priest, who suffered at the\r\nsame time. The ceiling of the church is painted by _Mengs_, and\r\nrepresents the apotheosis of the patron saint. The campanile dates from\r\n1220. In this convent (which was conceded to the Jesuits in 1825 by Leo\r\nXII.) English clergymen about to join the Roman Catholic Church\r\nfrequently \"make a retreat\" before their reception; Archdeacon\r\nWilberforce is one of many converts who have been received here.\r\n\r\nTurning towards Sta. Maria Maggiore, on the left is a _Cross_ on a\r\npedestal formed by a cannon reversed, and inscribed \"In hoc signo\r\nvinces,\"--a memorial of the absolution given by Clement VIII. in 1595 to\r\nHenry IV. of France on his being received into the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nOpposite this is a peculiar round arched doorway--unique in\r\nRome--forming the entrance to the _Church of S. Antonio Abbate_, said to\r\noccupy the site of a temple of Diana. The church is decorated with very\r\ncoarsely-executed frescoes of the life of the saint,--his birth, his\r\nconfirmation by a bishop who predicted his future saintship, and his\r\ntemptation by the devil in various forms.\r\n\r\n     \"S. Antonio, called 'the patriarch of monks,' became a hermit in\r\n     his twentieth year, and lived alone in the Egyptian desert till his\r\n     fifty-fifth year, when he founded his monastery of Phaim, where he\r\n     died at the age of 105, having passed his life in perpetual prayer,\r\n     and often tasting no food for three days at a time. In the desert\r\n     Satan was permitted to assault him in a visible manner, to terrify\r\n     him with dismal noises; and once he so grievously beat him that he\r\n     lay almost dead, covered with bruises and wounds. At other times\r\n     the fiends attacked him with terrible clamours, and a variety of\r\n     spectres, in hideous shapes of the most frightful wild beasts,\r\n     which they assumed to dismay and terrify him; till a ray of\r\n     heavenly light breaking in upon him, chased them away, and caused\r\n     him to cry out, 'Where wast thou, my Lord and Master? Why wast thou\r\n     not with me?' And a voice answered, 'Anthony, I was here the whole\r\n     time; I stood by thee, and beheld thy combat: and because thou hast\r\n     manfully withstood thy enemies I will always protect thee, and will\r\n     render thy name famous throughout the earth.'\"--_Butler's Lives of\r\n     the Saints._\r\n\r\n     \"Surely the imagery painted on the inner walls of Egyptian tombs,\r\n     and probably believed by Anthony and his compeers to be connected\r\n     with devil-worship, explains his visions. In the 'Words of the\r\n     Elders' a monk complains of being troubled with 'pictures, old and\r\n     new.' Probably, again, the pain which Anthony felt was the agony of\r\n     a fever, and the visions which he saw its delirium.\"--_Kingsley's\r\n     Hermits._\r\n\r\nIn the chapel of S. Antonio is a very ancient mosaic, representing a\r\ntiger tearing a bull.\r\n\r\n     \"Le tigre en mosaïque conservé dans l'église de St. Antoine, patron\r\n     des animaux, est, selon toute apparence, le portrait d'un acteur\r\n     renommé.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iv. 28.\r\n\r\nHither, on the week following the feast of St. Anthony (January 17),\r\nhorses, mules, and cows are brought to be blest as a preservative\r\nagainst accidents for the year to come. On the 23rd, the horses of the\r\npope, Prince Borghese, and other Roman grandees (about 2½ P.M.) are\r\nsent for this purpose. All the animals are sprinkled with holy water by\r\na priest, who receives a gift in proportion to the wealth of their\r\nmaster, and recites over each group the formula,--\r\n\r\n     \"Per intercessionem beati Antonii Abbatis, hæc animalia liberantur\r\n     a malis, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen!\"\r\n\r\n     \"Les bergers romains faisaient la _lustration_ de leurs taureaux;\r\n     ils purifiaient leurs brebis à la fête de Pales (pour écarter d'eux\r\n     toute influence funeste), comme ils les font encore asperger d'eau\r\n     bénite à la fête de Saint Antoine.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ ii.\r\n     329.[272]\r\n\r\n     \"'Long live St. Anthony,' writes Mabillon (in the 17th century) as\r\n     he describes the horses, asses, and mules, all going on the saint's\r\n     festival to be sprinkled with holy water, and receive the\r\n     benediction of a reverend father. 'All would go to ruin,' say the\r\n     Romans, 'if this act of piety were omitted.' So nobody escapes\r\n     paying toll on this occasion, not even Nostro Signore\r\n     himself.\"--_Stephens' French Benedictines._\r\n\r\n     \"S. Antonio Abbate is the patron of the four-footed creation, and\r\n     his feast is a saturnalia for the usually hard-worked beasts and\r\n     for their attendants and drivers. Gentlefolks must be content on\r\n     this day to stay at home or go on foot, for there are not wanting\r\n     solemn tales of how the unbelievers who had obliged their coachmen\r\n     to drive out on this day have been punished by great misfortunes.\r\n     The church of S. Antonio stands in a large piazza, usually looking\r\n     like a desert; but to-day it was enlivened by a varied throng:\r\n     horses and mules, with tails and manes splendidly interlaced with\r\n     ribbons, are brought to a small chapel standing somewhat apart from\r\n     the church, where a priest armed with a large asperge plentifully\r\n     besprinkles the animals with the holy water which is placed before\r\n     him in tubs and pails, sometimes apparently with a sly wish to\r\n     excite them to gambols. Devout coachmen bring larger or smaller\r\n     wax-tapers, and their masters send alms and gifts, in order to\r\n     secure to their valuable and useful animals a year's exemption from\r\n     disease and accident. Horned cattle and donkeys, equally precious\r\n     and serviceable to their owners, have their share in the\r\n     blessing.\"--_Goethe, Romische Briefe._\r\n\r\n     \"At the blessing of the animals, an adventure happened, which\r\n     afforded us some amusement. A countryman, having got a blessing on\r\n     his beast, putting his whole trust in its power, set off from the\r\n     church door at a grand gallop, and had scarcely cleared a hundred\r\n     yards before the ungainly animal tumbled down with him, and over\r\n     its head he rolled into the dirt. He soon got up, however, and\r\n     shook himself, and so did the horse, without either seeming to be\r\n     much the worse. The priest seemed not a whit out of countenance at\r\n     this; and some of the standers-by exclaimed, with laudable\r\n     steadfastness of faith, 'That but for the blessing, they might have\r\n     broken their necks.'\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"Un postilion Italien, qui voyait mourir son cheval, priait pour\r\n     lui, et s'écriait: O, Sant' Antonio, abbiate pietà dell' anima\r\n     sua!\"--_Madame de Staël._\r\n\r\n     \"The hog was the representative of the demon of sensuality and\r\n     gluttony, which Anthony is supposed to have vanquished by the\r\n     exercise of piety and by the divine aid. The ancient custom of\r\n     placing in all his effigies a black pig at his feet, or under his\r\n     feet, gave rise to the superstition, that this unclean animal was\r\n     especially dedicated to him and under his protection. The monks of\r\n     the Order of St. Anthony kept herds of consecrated pigs, which were\r\n     allowed to feed at the public charge, and which it was a\r\n     profanation to steal or kill; hence the proverb about the fatness\r\n     of a 'Tantony pig.'\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 750.\r\n\r\nWe now enter the Piazza of Sta. Maria Maggiore, in front of which stands\r\na beautiful Corinthian column, now called _Colonna della Vergine_. This\r\nis the last remaining column of the Basilica of Constantine, and is\r\nforty-seven feet high without its base and capital. It was brought\r\nhither by Paul V. in 1613. The figure of the Virgin on the top is by\r\nBertelot.\r\n\r\nThe _Basilica of Sta. Maria Maggiore_, frequently named from its founder\r\nthe _Liberian Basilica_, was founded A.D. 352, by Pope Liberius, and\r\nJohn,[273] a Roman patrician, to commemorate a miraculous fall of snow,\r\nwhich covered this spot of ground and no other, on the 5th of August,\r\nwhen the Virgin appearing in a vision, showed them that she had thus\r\nappropriated the site of a new temple.[274] This legend is commemorated\r\nevery year on the 5th of August, the festa of La Madonna della Neve,\r\nwhen, during a solemn high mass in the Borghese chapel, showers of white\r\nrose-leaves are thrown down constantly through two holes in the ceiling,\r\n\"like a leafy mist between the priests and worshippers.\"\r\n\r\nThis church, in spite of many alterations, is in some respects\r\ninternally the most beautiful and harmonious building in Rome, and\r\nretains much of the character which it received when rebuilt between 432\r\nand 440, by Sixtus III., who dedicated it to Sta. Maria Mater Dei, and\r\nestablished it as one of the four patriarchal basilicas, whence it is\r\nprovided with the \"porta santa,\" only opened by the pope, with great\r\nsolemnity, four times in a century.\r\n\r\nThe west front was added under Benedict XIV. (Lambertini) in 1741, by\r\nFerdinando Fuga, destroying a portico of the time of Eugenius III., of\r\nwhich the only remnant is an architrave, inserted into which is an\r\ninscription, quoted by its defenders in proof of the existence of\r\nMariolatry in the twelfth century:--\r\n\r\n    \"Tertius Eugenius Romanus Papa benignus\r\n      Obtulit hoc munus, Virgo Maria, tibi,\r\n    Quæ Mater Christi fieri merito meruisti,\r\n      Salva perpetua Virginitate tibi.\r\n    Es Via, Vita, Salus, totius Gloria Mundi,\r\n      Da veniam culpis, Virginitatis Honos.\"\r\n\r\nIn this portico is a statue of Philip IV. of Spain by _Lucenti_. In the\r\nupper story are preserved the mosaics which once decorated the old\r\nfaçade, some of them representing the miracle which led to the\r\nfoundation of the church.\r\n\r\n     \"To 1300 belong the mosaics on the upper part of the façade of Sta.\r\n     Maria Maggiore (now inserted in the loggia), in which, in two rows,\r\n     framed in architectural decorations, may be seen Christ in the act\r\n     of benediction, and several saints above, and the legend of the\r\n     founding of the church below--both well-arranged compositions. An\r\n     inscription gives the name of the otherwise unknown master,\r\n     'Philippus Rusuti.' This work was formerly attributed to the\r\n     Florentine mosaicist Gaddo Gaddi, who died 1312.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nFive doors, if we include the walled-up Porta Santa, lead into the\r\nmagnificent nave (280 feet long, 60 broad), lined by an avenue of white\r\nmarble columns, surmounted by a frieze of mosaic pictures from the Old\r\nTestament, of A.D. 440--unbroken, except where six of the subjects have\r\nbeen cut away to make room for arches in front of the two great side\r\nchapels. The mosaics increase in splendour as they approach the tribune,\r\nin front of which is a grand baldacchino by Fuga, erected by Benedict\r\nXIV., supported by four porphyry columns wreathed with gilt leaves, and\r\nsurmounted by four marble angels by Pietro Bracci. The pavement is of\r\nthe most glorious opus-alexandrinum, and its crimson and violet hues\r\ntemper the white and gold on the walls. The flat roof (by Sangallo),\r\npanelled and carved, is gilt with the first gold brought to Spain from\r\nSouth America, and presented to Alexander VI. by Ferdinand and Isabella.\r\n\r\n     \"The mosaics above the chancel arch are valuable for the\r\n     illustration of Christian doctrine: the throne of the Lamb as\r\n     described in the Apocalypse, SS. Peter and Paul beside it (the\r\n     earliest instance of their being thus represented); and the four\r\n     symbols of the Evangelists above; the Annunciation; the Angel\r\n     appearing to Zacharias; the Massacre of the Innocents; the\r\n     Presentation in the Temple; the Adoration of the Magi; Herod\r\n     receiving the head of St. John the Baptist; and, below these\r\n     groups, a flock of sheep, type of the faithful, issuing from the\r\n     mystic cities, Bethlehem and Jerusalem. We see here one curious\r\n     example of the nimbus, round the head of Herod, as a symbol of\r\n     power, apart from sanctity. In certain details these mosaics have\r\n     been altered, with a view to adapting them to modern devotional\r\n     bias, in a manner that deserves reprobation; but Ciampini\r\n     (Monumenta Vetera) shows us in engraving what the originals were\r\n     before this alteration, effected under Benedict XIV. In the group\r\n     of the Adoration the child _alone_ occupied the throne, while\r\n     opposite (in the original work) was seated, on another chair, an\r\n     elderly person in a long blue mantle veiling the head--concluded by\r\n     Ciampini to be the senior among the Magi; the two others, younger,\r\n     and both in the usual Oriental dress, with trousers and Phrygian\r\n     caps, being seen to approach at the same side, whilst the mother\r\n     _stood_ beside the throne of the child,--her figure recognisable\r\n     from its resemblance to others in scenes where she appears in the\r\n     same series. As this group is now before us, the erect figure is\r\n     left out; the seated one is converted into that of Mary, with a\r\n     halo round the head, though in the original even such attribute\r\n     (alike given to the Saviour and to all the angels introduced) is\r\n     _not_ assigned to her.\"--_Hemans' Ancient Christian Art._\r\n\r\nThe vault of the tribune is covered with mosaics by Jacopo da Turrita,\r\nthe same who executed those at the Lateran basilica.\r\n\r\n     \"A general affinity with the style of Cimabue is observable in some\r\n     mosaics executed by contemporary artists. Those in Sta. Maria\r\n     Maggiore are inscribed with the name of Jacobus Torriti, and\r\n     executed between 1287 and 1292. They are surpassed by no\r\n     contemporary work in dignity, grace, and decorative beauty of\r\n     arrangement. In a blue, gold-starred circle is seen Christ\r\n     enthroned with the Virgin; on each side are adoring angels,\r\n     kneeling and flying, on a gold ground, with St. Peter and St. Paul,\r\n     the two St. Johns, St. Francis, and St. Anthony (the same in size\r\n     and position as at St. J. Lateran), advancing devoutly along. The\r\n     upper part is filled with graceful vine-branches, with symbolical\r\n     animals among them. Below is Jordan, with small river gods, boats,\r\n     and figures of men and animals. Further below are scenes from the\r\n     life of Christ in animated arrangement. The group in the centre of\r\n     the circle, of Christ enthroned with the Virgin, is especially\r\n     fine: while the Saviour is placing the crown on His mother's head,\r\n     she lifts up her hands with the expression both of admiration and\r\n     of modest remonstrance.[275] The forms are very pure and noble; the\r\n     execution careful, and very different from the Roman mosaics of the\r\n     twelfth century.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nIn front of and beneath the high altar Pius IX. has lately been\r\npreparing his own monument, by constructing a splendid chamber\r\napproached by staircases, and lined with the most precious alabaster and\r\nmarbles.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the western entrance is the tomb of the Rospigliosi\r\npope, Clement IX. (1667--69), the work of Ercole Ferrata, a pupil of\r\nBernini. His body rests before the high altar, surrounded by a number of\r\nthe members of his family. Left of the entrance is the tomb of Nicholas\r\nIV., Masci (1288-92), erected to his memory three hundred years after\r\nhis death by Sixtus V. while still a cardinal. He is represented giving\r\nbenediction, between two allegorical figures of Justice and Religion,--a\r\nfine work of Leonardo da Sarzana.\r\n\r\n     \"It is well to know that this pope, a mere upstart from the dust,\r\n     sought to support himself through the mighty family of Colonna, by\r\n     raising them too high. His friend, the Cardinal Giacomo Colonna,\r\n     contributed with him to the renewal of the mosaics which are in the\r\n     tribune of Sta. Maria Maggiore, and one can see their two figures\r\n     there to this day. It was in this reign that Ptolemais, the last\r\n     possession of the Christians in Asia, fell into the hands of the\r\n     Mohammedans; thus ended the era of the Crusades.\"--_Gregorovius._\r\n\r\nBehind this tomb, near the walled-up Porta Santa, is a good tomb of two\r\nbishops, brothers, of the fifteenth century, and in the same aisle are\r\nmany other monuments of the sixteenth century, some of them fine in\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\nNearly on a line with the baldacchino is the entrance of the _Borghese\r\nChapel_, built by Flaminio Ponzio for Paul V. in 1608, gorgeous with\r\nprecious marbles and alabasters. Over its altar is preserved one of the\r\npictures attributed to St. Luke (and announced to be such in a papal\r\nbull attached to the walls!), much revered from the belief that it\r\nstayed the plague which decimated the city during the reign of Pelagius\r\nII., and that (after its intercession had been sought by a procession by\r\norder of Innocent VIII.) it brought about the overthrow of the Moorish\r\ndominion in Spain.\r\n\r\n     \"On conserve à Sainte Marie Majeure une des images de la Madonne\r\n     peintes par St. Luc, et plusieurs fois on a trouvé les anges\r\n     chantant les litanies autour de ce tableau.\"--_Stendhal._\r\n\r\n     The \"Scheme of decorations in this gorgeous chapel is so\r\n     remarkable, as testifying to the development which the theological\r\n     idea of the Virgin, as the Sposa or personified Church, had\r\n     attained in the time of Paul V.--the same pope who in 1615\r\n     promulgated the famous bull relative to the Immaculate\r\n     Conception\"--that the insertion of the whole passage of Mrs.\r\n     Jameson on this subject will not be considered too much.\r\n\r\n     \"First, and elevated above all, we have the 'Madonna della\r\n     Concezione,' 'Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception,' in a glory of\r\n     light, sustained and surrounded by angels, having the crescent\r\n     under her feet, according to the approved treatment.

The four great prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel,\r\n     in their usual place in the four pendatives of the dome.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Two large frescoes. In the first the Vision of St. Gregory\r\n     Thaumaturgus, and Heretics bitten by Serpents. In the second, St.\r\n     John Damascene and S. Ildefonso miraculously rewarded for defending\r\n     the majesty of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n     \"3. A large fresco, representing the four Doctors of the Church who\r\n     had especially written in honour of the Virgin: viz., Irenæus and\r\n     Cyprian, Ignatius and Theophilus, grouped two and two.\r\n\r\n     \"4. St. Luke, who painted the Virgin, and whose gospel contains the\r\n     best account of her.\r\n\r\n     \"5. As spiritual conquerors in the name of the Virgin, St. Dominic\r\n     and St. Francis, each attended by two companions of his Order.\r\n\r\n     \"6. As military conquerors in the name of the Virgin, the Emperor\r\n     Heraclius, and Narses, the general against the Arians.\r\n\r\n     \"7. A group of three female figures, representing the three famous\r\n     saintly princesses, who in marriage preserved their virginity,\r\n     Pulcheria, Edeltruda (our famous Queen Ethelreda), and Cunegunda.\r\n\r\n     \"8. A group of three learned Bishops, who had especially defended\r\n     the immaculate purity of the Virgin, St. Cyril, St. Anselm, and St.\r\n     Denis (?).\r\n\r\n     \"9. The miserable ends of those who were opposed to the honour of\r\n     the Virgin. 1. The death of Julian the Apostate, very oddly\r\n     represented; he lies on an altar, transfixed by an arrow, as a\r\n     victim; St. Mercurius in the air. 2. The death of Leo IV., who\r\n     destroyed the effigies of the Virgin. 3. The death of Constantine\r\n     IV., also a famous iconoclast.\r\n\r\n     \"The statues which are placed in niches are--\r\n\r\n     \"1--2. St. Joseph, as the nominal husband, and St. John the\r\n     Evangelist, as the nominal son, of the Virgin; the latter, also, as\r\n     prophet and poet, with reference to the passage in the Revelation,\r\n     xii. i.\r\n\r\n     \"3--4. Aaron, as priestly ancestor (because his wand blossomed),\r\n     and David, as kingly ancestor, of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n     \"5--6. St. Dionysius the Areopagite, who was present at the death\r\n     of the Virgin, and St. Bernard, who composed the famous 'Salve\r\n     Regina' in her honour.\r\n\r\n     \"Such is this grand systematic scheme of decoration, which, to\r\n     those who regard it cursorily, is merely a sumptuous confusion of\r\n     colours and forms, or at best a 'fine example of the Guido school\r\n     and Bernini.' It is altogether a very complete and magnificent\r\n     specimen of the prevalent style of art, and a very comprehensive\r\n     and suggestive expression of the prevalent tendency of thought in\r\n     the Roman Catholic Church from the beginning of the seventeenth\r\n     century. In no description of this chapel have I seen the names and\r\n     subjects accurately given: the style of art belongs to the\r\n     _decadence_, and the taste being worse than questionable, the\r\n     prevailing _doctrinal_ idea has been neglected, or never\r\n     understood.\"--_Legends of the Madonna_, lxxi.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the tomb of Clement VIII. (1592--1605), the Florentine\r\nIppolito Aldobrandini, the builder of the new palace of the Vatican, and\r\nthe cruel torturer and executioner of the Cenci. He is represented in\r\nthe act of benediction. The bas-reliefs on his monument commemorate the\r\nprincipal events of his reign,--the conclusion of peace between France\r\nand Spain, and the taking of Ferrara, which he seized from the heirs of\r\nAlphonso II.\r\n\r\nOn the left is the tomb of Paul V. (1605-1621), Camillo Borghese,--in\r\nwhose reign St. Peter's was finished, as every traveller learns from the\r\ngigantic inscription over its portico,--who founded the great Borghese\r\nfamily, and left to his nephew, Cardinal Scipio Borghese, a fortune\r\nwhich enabled him to buy the Borghese Palace and to build the Borghese\r\nVilla.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a truly herculean figure, with a grandly developed head,\r\n     while in his thick neck, pride, violence, and sensuality seem to be\r\n     united. He is the first pope who wore the beard of a cavalier, like\r\n     that of Henry IV., which recalls the Thirty-years' War, which he\r\n     lived through; as far as the battle of the White Mountain. In this\r\n     round, domineering, pride-swollen countenance, appears the\r\n     violent, imperious spirit of Paul, which aimed at an absolute\r\n     power. Who does not remember his famous quarrel with Venice, and\r\n     the rôle which his far superior adversary Paolo Sarpi played with\r\n     such invincible courage? The bas-reliefs of his tomb represent the\r\n     reception given by the pope to the envoys of Congo and Japan, the\r\n     building of the citadel of Ferrara, the sending of auxiliary troops\r\n     to Hungary to the assistance of Rudolph II., and the canonization\r\n     of Sta. Francesca Romana and S. Carlo Borromeo.\"--_Gregorovius._\r\n\r\nThe frescoes in the cupola are by _Cigoli_; those around the altar by\r\nthe Cav. D'Arpino; those above the tombs and on the arches by _Guido_,\r\nexcept the Madonna, which is by _Lanfranco_. The late beloved Princess\r\nBorghese, _née_ Lady Gwendoline Talbot, was buried in front of the\r\naltar, all Rome following her to the grave.\r\n\r\n     The funeral of Princess Borghese proved the feeling with which she\r\n     was regarded. Her body lay upon a car which was drawn by forty\r\n     young Romans, and was followed by all the poor of Rome, the\r\n     procession swelling like a river in every street and piazza it\r\n     passed through, while from all the windows as it passed flowers\r\n     were showered down. In funeral ceremonies of great personages at\r\n     Rome an ancient custom is observed by which, when the body is\r\n     lowered into the grave, a chamberlain, coming out to the church\r\n     door, announces to the coachman, who is waiting with the family\r\n     carriage, that his master or mistress has no longer need of his\r\n     services; and the coachman thereupon breaks his staff of office and\r\n     drives mournfully away. When this formality was fulfilled at the\r\n     funeral of Princess Borghese, the whole of the vast crowd waiting\r\n     outside the basilica broke into tears and sobs, and kneeling by a\r\n     common impulse, prayed aloud for the soul of their benefactress.\r\n\r\nThe chapel has been lately the scene of a miraculous story, with\r\nreference to a visionary appearance of the Princess Borghese, which has\r\nobtained great credit among the people, by whom she is already looked\r\nupon as a saint.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel in the right aisle is that of the Patrizi family, and\r\nclose by is the sepulchral stone of their noble ancestor, Giovanni\r\nPatricino, whose bones were found beneath the high altar, and deposited\r\nhere in 1700. A little further is the chapel of the Santa Croce, with\r\nten porphyry columns. Then comes the _Chapel of the Holy Sacrament_,\r\nbuilt by Fontana for Sixtus V. while still Cardinal of Montalto. Gregory\r\nXIII., who was then on the throne, visited this gorgeous chapel when it\r\nwas nearly completed, and immediately decided that one who could build\r\nsuch a splendid temple was sufficiently rich, and suppressed the\r\ncardinal's pension. Fontana advanced a thousand scudi for the completion\r\nof the work, and had the delicacy never to allow the cardinal to imagine\r\nthat he was indebted to him. The chapel, restored 1870, is adorned with\r\nstatues by Giobattista Pozzo, Cesare Nebbia, and others. Under the altar\r\nis a presepio--one of the best works of Bernini, and opposite to it, in\r\nthe confession, a beautiful statue of S. Gaetano (founder of the\r\nTheatines, who died 1547[276]), with two little children. On the right\r\nis the splendid tomb of Pius V., Michaele Ghislieri (1566--72), the\r\nbarefooted, bareheaded Dominican monk of Sta. Sabina, who in his short\r\nsix years' reign beheld amongst other events the victory of Lepanto, the\r\nfall of the Huguenots in France, and the massacre of St. Bartholomew,\r\nevents which were celebrated at Rome with _fêtes_ and thanksgivings. The\r\nfigure of the pope, a monk wasted to a skeleton (by Leonardo de\r\nSarzana), sits in the central niche, between statues of St. Dominic and\r\nSt. Peter Martyr. A number of bas-reliefs by different sculptors\r\nrepresent the events of his life. Some are by the Flemish artists\r\nNicolas d'Arras and Egidius.\r\n\r\nOn the left, is the tomb of Sixtus V. (1585-90), Felice Perretti, who\r\nas a boy kept his father's pigs at Montalto; who as a young man was a\r\nFranciscan monk preaching in the Apostoli, and attracting crowds by his\r\neloquence; and who then rose to be bishop of Fermo, soon after to be\r\ncardinal, and was lastly raised to the papal throne, which he occupied\r\nonly five years, a time which sufficed for the prince of the Church who\r\nloved building the most, to renew Rome entirely.\r\n\r\n     \"If anything can still the spectator to silence, and awaken him to\r\n     great recollections, it is the monument of this astonishing man,\r\n     who, as child, herded swine, and as an old man commanded people and\r\n     kings, and who filled Rome with so many works, that from every side\r\n     his name, like an echo, rings in the traveller's ear. We never\r\n     cease to be amazed at the wonderful luck which raised Napoleon from\r\n     the dust to the throne of the world, as if it were a romance or a\r\n     fairy story. But if in the history of kings these astonishing\r\n     changes are extraordinary accidents, they seem quite natural in the\r\n     history of the popes, they belong to the very essence of\r\n     Christendom, which does not appeal to the person, but to the\r\n     spirit; and while the one history is full of ordinary men, who,\r\n     without the prerogative of their crown, would have sunk into\r\n     eternal oblivion, the other is rich in great men, who, placed in a\r\n     different sphere, would have been equally worthy of\r\n     renown.\"--_Gregorovius._\r\n\r\nIn a little chapel on the left of the entrance of this--which is as it\r\nwere a transept of the church--is a fine picture of St. Jerome by\r\n_Spagnuoletto_, and in the chapel opposite a sarcophagus of two early\r\nChristian consuls, richly wrought in the Roman imperial style, but with\r\nChristian subjects,--Daniel in the den of lions, Zaccheus in the\r\nsycamore-tree, Martha at the raising of Lazarus, &c.\r\n\r\nAt the east end of the right aisle, near the door, is perhaps the finest\r\ngothic monument in Rome,--the tomb of Cardinal Gonsalvi, bishop of\r\nAlbano, _c._ 1299.\r\n\r\n     \"A recumbent statue, in pontifical vestments, rests on a\r\n     sarcophagus, and two angels draw aside curtains as if to show us\r\n     the dead; in the background is a mosaic of Mary enthroned, with\r\n     the Child, the apostle Matthias, St. Jerome, and a smaller kneeling\r\n     figure of Gonsalvi, in pontifical robes; at the apex is a\r\n     tabernacle with cusped arch, and below the epitaph 'Hoc opus fecit\r\n     Joannes Magister Cosmæ civis Romanus,' the artist's record of\r\n     himself. In the hands of St. Matthias and St. Jerome are scrolls;\r\n     on that held by the apostle, the words, 'Me tenet ara prior'; on\r\n     St. Jerome's,'Recubo presepis ad antrum', these epigraphs\r\n     confirming the tradition that the bodies of St. Matthias and St.\r\n     Jerome repose in this church, while indicating the sites of their\r\n     tombs. Popular regards have distinguished this tomb; no doubt in\r\n     intended honour to the Blessed Virgin, lamps are kept ever burning,\r\n     and vases of flowers ranged, before her mosaic image.\"--_Hemans'\r\n     Mediæval Christian Art._\r\n\r\nAt the west end of the right aisle is the entrance of the _Baptistery_,\r\nwhich has a vast porphyry vase as a font. Hence we reach the _Sacristy_,\r\nin the inner chamber of which are some exceedingly beautiful bas-reliefs\r\nby _Mino da Fiesole_.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of the Christmas ceremonies is the procession at 5\r\nA.M., in honour of the great relic of the church--the Santa\r\nCulla--_i.e._, the cradle in which our Saviour was carried into Egypt,\r\nnot, as is frequently imagined, the manger, which is allowed to have\r\nbeen of stone, and of which a single stone only is supposed to have\r\nfound its way to Rome, and to be preserved in the altar of the Blessed\r\nSacrament. The \"Santa Culla\" is preserved in a magnificent reliquary,\r\nsix feet high, adorned with bas-reliefs and statuettes in silver. On the\r\nafternoon of Christmas eve the public can visit the relic at an altar in\r\na little chapel near the sacristy. On the afternoon of Christmas Day it\r\nis also exposed, but upon the high altar, where it is less easily seen.\r\n\r\n     \"Le Seigneur Jésus a voulu naître dans une étable; mais les hommes\r\n     ont apporté précieusement le petit berceau qui a reçu le salut du\r\n     monde, dans la reine des cités, et ils l'ont enchâssé dans l'or.\r\n\r\n     \"C'est bien ici que nous devons accourir avec joie et redire ce\r\n     chant triomphant de l'Église: _Adeste, fideles, læti triumphantes;\r\n     venite, venite in Bethleem_.\"--_Une Chrétienne à Rome._\r\n\r\nAmong the many other relics preserved here are two little bags of the\r\nbrains of St. Thomas à Becket.\r\n\r\nIt was in this church that Pope St. Martin I. was celebrating mass in\r\nthe seventh century, when a guard sent by the Exarch Olympius appeared\r\non the threshold with orders to seize and put him to death. At the sight\r\nof the pontiff the soldier was stricken with blindness, a miracle which\r\nled to the conversion of Olympius and many other persons.\r\n\r\nPlatina, the historian of the popes, was buried here, with the epitaph:\r\n\"Quisquis es, si pius, Platynam et sua ne vexes, anguste jacent et soli\r\nvolunt esse.\"\r\n\r\nSta. Maria Maggiore was the scene of the seizure of Hildebrand by\r\nCencius:\r\n\r\n     \"On Christmas Eve, 1075, the city of Rome was visited by a dreadful\r\n     tempest. Darkness brooded over the land, and the trembling\r\n     spectators believed that the day of final judgment was about to\r\n     dawn. In this war of the elements, however, two processions were\r\n     seen advancing to the Church of Sta. Maria Maggiore. At the head of\r\n     one was the aged Hildebrand, conducting a few priests to worship at\r\n     the shrine of the Virgo Deipara. The other was preceded by Cencius,\r\n     a Roman noble. At each pause in the tempest might be heard the\r\n     hallelujahs of the worshippers, or the voice of the pontiff,\r\n     pouring out benedictions on the little flock which knelt before\r\n     him--when Cencius grasped his person, and some yet more daring\r\n     ruffian inflicted a wound on his forehead. Bound with cords,\r\n     stripped of his sacred vestments, beaten, and subjected to the\r\n     basest indignities, the venerable minister of Christ was carried to\r\n     a fortified mansion within the walls of the city, again to be\r\n     removed at daybreak to exile or death. Women were there, with\r\n     women's sympathy and kindly offices, but they were rudely put\r\n     aside; and a drawn sword was already aimed at the pontiff's bosom,\r\n     when the cries of a fierce multitude, threatening to burn or batter\r\n     down the house, arrested the aim of the assassin. An arrow,\r\n     discharged from below, reached and slew him. The walls rocked\r\n     beneath the strokes of the maddened populace, and Cencius, falling\r\n     at his prisoner's feet, became himself a suppliant for pardon and\r\n     for life.... In profound silence, and with undisturbed serenity,\r\n     Hildebrand had thus far submitted to these atrocious indignities.\r\n     The occasional raising of his eyes towards heaven alone indicated\r\n     his consciousness of them. But to the supplication of his prostrate\r\n     enemy he returned an instant and a calm assurance of forgiveness.\r\n     He rescued Cencius from the exasperated besiegers, dismissed him in\r\n     safety and in peace, and returned, amidst the acclamations of the\r\n     whole Roman people, to complete the interrupted solemnities of Sta.\r\n     Maria Maggiore.\"--_Stephens' Lectures on Eccles. Hist._\r\n\r\nLeaving the church by the door behind the tribune, we find ourselves at\r\nthe top of the steep slope of the Esquiline and in front of an _Obelisk_\r\nerected here by Fontana for Sixtus V.,--brought from Egypt by Claudius,\r\nand one of two which were used to guard the entrance to the mausoleum of\r\nAugustus. The inscriptions on three of its sides are worth\r\nnotice:--\"Christi Dei in æternum viventis cunabula lætissime colo, qui\r\nmortui sepulchro Augusti tristis serviebam.\"--\"Quem Augustus de vergine\r\nnasciturum vivens adoravit, sed deinceps dominum dici noluit,\r\nadoro.\"--\"Christus per invictam crucem populo pacem præbeat, qui Augusti\r\npace in præsepe nasci voluit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BASILICAS OF THE LATERAN, SANTA CROCE, AND S. LORENZO.\r\n\r\n     Via S. Giovanni--The Obelisk and Baptistery--Basilica and\r\n     Cloisters--Mosaic of the Triclinium--Santa Scala--Palace of the\r\n     Lateran--Villa Massimo Arsole--SS. Pietro e Marcellino--Villa\r\n     Wolkonski--(Porta Furba--Tombs of the Via Latina--Basilica of S.\r\n     Stefano)--Santa Croce in Gerusalemme--Amphitheatrum\r\n     Castrense--Porta Maggiore--(Tomb of Sta. Helena--Torre dei\r\n     Schiavi--Cervaletto--Cerbara)--Porta and Basilica of S.\r\n     Lorenzo--Catacomb of S. Hippolytus.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the Coliseum the Via S. Giovanni ascends the slope of the\r\nEsquiline. In mediæval times this road was always avoided by the popes,\r\non account (as most authorities state) of the scandal attaching to the\r\nmore than doubtful legend of Joan, the famous papessa, who is said to\r\nhave horrified her attendants by giving birth to a child on this spot,\r\nduring a procession from the Lateran, and to have died of shame and\r\nterror immediately afterwards. Joan is stated to have been educated at\r\nAthens, to have skilfully obtained her election to the papal throne,\r\ndisguised as a man, between the reign of Leo IV. and that of Benedict\r\nIII. (855), and to have taken the name of John VIII. In the cathedral of\r\nSiena the heads of all the popes in terra-cotta (down to Alexander\r\nIII.) decorate the frieze above the arches of the nave, and among them\r\nwas that of Pope Joan, inscribed \"Johannes VIII. Femina de Anglia,\" till\r\n1600, when it was changed into a head of Pope Zacharias by the Grand\r\nDuke, at the request of Pope Clement VIII.\r\n\r\nOn the left of this street is S. Clemente (described Ch. VII.). On the\r\nright, a long wall flooded by a cascade of Banksia roses in spring, and\r\na villa inlaid with terra-cotta ornaments, are those of the favourite\r\nresidence of the well-known Marchese Campana, the learned archæologist\r\nof Etruria, and the chief benefactor of the Etruscan museum at the\r\nVatican, cruelly imprisoned and exiled by the papal government in 1858,\r\nupon an accusation of having tampered with the revenues of Monte di\r\nPietà.\r\n\r\nBeyond the turn of the road leading to S. Stefano Rotondo (Ch. VII.),\r\nbas-reliefs of Our Saviour's Head (from the Acheirotopeton in the Sancta\r\nSanctorum) between two candelabra--upon the different buildings,\r\nannounce the property of the Lateran chapter.\r\n\r\nThe _Piazza di San Giovanni_ is surrounded by a remarkable group of\r\nbuildings. In front are the Baptistery and Basilica of the Lateran. On\r\nthe right is a Hospital for women, capable of containing 600 patients;\r\non the left, beyond the modern palace, are seen the buildings which\r\nenclose the Santa Scala, and some broken arches of the Aqua Marcia. In\r\nthe centre of the piazza is the _Obelisk of the Lateran_, 150 feet high,\r\nthe oldest object in Rome, being referred by translators of\r\nhieroglyphics to the year 1740 B.C., when it was raised in memory of the\r\nPharaoh Thothmes IV. It was brought, from the temple of the Sun at\r\nHeliopolis, to Alexandria by Constantine, and removed thence by his son\r\nConstantius to Rome, where it was used, together with the obelisk now in\r\nthe Piazza del Popolo, to ornament the Circus Maximus. Hence it was\r\nmoved to its present site in 1588, by Fontana, for Sixtus V. The obelisk\r\nwas then broken into three pieces, and in order to piece them together,\r\nsome part had to be cut off, but it is still the tallest in the city.\r\nOne of the inscriptions on the basement is false, as it narrates that\r\nConstantine received at the Lateran the baptism which he did not receive\r\ntill he was dying at Nicomedia.\r\n\r\nAn octagon building of mean and miserable exterior is that of the\r\n_Baptistery of the Lateran_, sometimes called S. Giovanni in Fonte,\r\nbuilt, not by Constantine, to whom it is falsely ascribed, but by Sixtus\r\nIII. (430-40). Of his time are the two porphyry columns at the entrance\r\non the side nearest the church, and the eight which form a colonnade\r\nround the interior, supporting a cornice from which rise the eight small\r\ncolumns of white marble, which sustain the dome. In the centre is the\r\nfont of green basalt in which Rienzi bathed on the night of August 1,\r\n1347, before his public appearance as a knight, when he summoned Clement\r\nVI. and other sovereigns of Europe to appear before him for judgment.\r\nThe cupola is decorated with scenes from the life of John the Baptist by\r\n_Andrea Sacchi_. On the walls are frescoes pourtraying the life of\r\nConstantine by _Gimignano_, _Carlo Maratta_, and _Andrea Camassei_.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the _Chapel of St. John the Baptist_, built by Pope\r\nHilary (461-67). Between two serpentine columns is a figure of St. John\r\nBaptist by _L. Valadico_ after Donatello.\r\n\r\nOn the left is the _Chapel of St. John the Evangelist_, also built by\r\nHilary, who presented its bronze doors (said to have once belonged to\r\nthe Baths of Caracalla) in remembrance of his delivery from the fury of\r\nfanatical monks at the Second Council of Ephesus, where he appeared as\r\nthe legate of Leo I.,--a fact commemorated by the inscription:\r\n\"Liberatori suo B. Joanni Evangelistæ Hilarius Episcopus famulus\r\nChristi.\" The vault is covered with mosaics representing the Spotless\r\nLamb in Paradise. Here is a statue of St. John by _Landini_.\r\n\r\nClose by is the entrance to the _Oratory of S. Venanzio_,[277] built in\r\n640 by John IV., and dedicated to St. Venantius, from a filial feeling\r\nto his father, who bore the same name. Nothing, however, remains of this\r\ntime but the mosaics. Those in the apse represent the Saviour in the act\r\nof benediction with angels, and below him the Virgin (an aged woman) in\r\nadoration,[278] with St. Peter and St. John Baptist, St. Paul and St.\r\nJohn the Evangelist, St. Venantius and St. Domnus--and another figure\r\nunnamed, probably John IV., holding the model of a church. Outside the\r\nchancel arch are eight saints, with their names (Palmianus, Julius,\r\nAsterius, Anastasius, Maurus, Septimius, Antiochianus, Cajanus), the\r\nsymbols of the evangelists, and the cities Bethlehem and Jerusalem; also\r\nthe verses:--\r\n\r\n    \"Martyribus Christi Domini pia vota Johannes\r\n    Reddidit antistes sanctificante Deo.\r\n    Ac sacri fontis simile fulgente metallo,\r\n    Providus instanter hoc copulavit opus:\r\n    Quo quisque gradiens et Christum pronus adorans,\r\n    Effusasque preces impetrat ille suas.\"\r\n\r\nThe next chapel, called the _Capella Borgia_, and used as the\r\nburial-place of that family, was once an open portico, but this\r\ncharacter was destroyed by the building up of the intercolumniations. On\r\nits façade are a number of fragments of ancient friezes, &c. Over the\r\ninner door is a bas-relief of the Crucifixion, of 1494.\r\n\r\nThe piteous modernization of this ancient group of chapels is chiefly\r\ndue to the folly of Urban VIII. The baptistery is used on Easter Eve for\r\nthe ceremony of adult baptism, the recipients being called Jews.\r\n\r\nThe _Lateran_ derives its name from a rich patrician family, whose\r\nestates were confiscated by Nero, when their head, Plautius Lateranus,\r\nwas put to death for taking part in the conspiracy of Piso.[279] It\r\nafterwards became an imperial residence, and a portion of it being given\r\nby Maximianus to his daughter Fausta, second wife of Constantine,\r\nreceived the name of \"Domus Faustæ.\" It was this which was given by\r\nConstantine to Pope Melchiades in 312,--a donation which was confirmed\r\nto St. Sylvester, in whose reign the first basilica was built here, and\r\nconsecrated on November 9, 324, Constantine having laboured with his own\r\nhands at the work. This basilica was overthrown by an earthquake in 896,\r\nbut was rebuilt by Sergius III. (904--11), being then dedicated to St.\r\nJohn the Baptist. This second basilica, whose glories are alluded to by\r\nDante,--\r\n\r\n           ----\"Quando Laterano\r\n    Alle cose mortale andò di sopra.\"\r\n\r\n    _Paradiso_, xxxi.\r\n\r\nwas of the greatest interest, but was almost entirely destroyed by fire\r\nin 1308. It was rebuilt, only to be again burnt down in 1360, when it\r\nremained for four years in utter ruin, in which state it was seen and\r\nmourned over by Petrarch. The fourth restoration of the basilica was due\r\nto Urban V. (1362-70), but it has since undergone a series of\r\nmutilations and modernizations, which have deplorably injured it. The\r\nwest front still retains the inscription \"Sacrosancta Lateranensis\r\necclesia, Omnium urbis et orbis Ecclesiarum Mater et Caput;\" the Chapter\r\nof the Lateran still takes precedence even over that of St. Peter's; and\r\nevery newly elected pope comes hither for his coronation.\r\n\r\n     \"St. J. Lateran est regardé comme le siége du patriarchal romain. À\r\n     St. Pierre le pape est souverain pontife. À St. J. Lateran il est\r\n     évêque de Rome. Quand le pape est élu, il vient à St. J. Lateran\r\n     prendre possession de son siége comme évêque de Rome.\"--_A. Du\r\n     Pays._\r\n\r\nThe west end of the basilica is in part a remnant of the building of the\r\ntenth century, and has two quaint towers (rebuilt by Sixtus IV.) at the\r\nend of the transept, and a rich frieze of terra-cotta. The church is\r\nentered from the transept by a portico, ending in a gloomy chapel which\r\ncontains a statue of Henry IV., by _Niccolo Cordieri_. The\r\n_transept_--rich in colour from its basement of varied marbles, and its\r\nupper frescoes of the legendary history of Constantine--is by far the\r\nfinest part of the basilica, which, as a whole, is infinitely inferior\r\nto Sta. Maria Maggiore. The nave, consisting of five aisles, is of grand\r\nproportions, but has been hideously modernized under _Borromini_, who\r\nhas enclosed all its ancient columns, except two near the tribune, in\r\ntawdry plaster piers, in front of which are huge statues of the\r\napostles; the roof is gilt and gaudy, the tabernacle ugly and\r\nill-proportioned,--only the ancient pavement of opus-alexandrinum is\r\nfine. Confessionals for different languages are placed here as in St.\r\nPeter's. The _Tabernacle_ was erected by Urban V. in the fourteenth\r\ncentury. Four granite columns support a gothic canopy, decorated at its\r\nangles with canopied statuettes. Between these, on either side, are\r\nthree much restored frescoes by _Berni da Siena_, those in central\r\npanels representing the Annunciation, the Crucifixion, the Coronation of\r\nthe Virgin, and the Saviour as a shepherd (very beautifully treated)\r\nfeeding his flock with corn. The skulls of SS. Peter and Paul are said\r\nto be preserved here. The altar encloses the greater part of the famous\r\nwooden table, saved at great risk of life from the conflagration of\r\n1308, upon which St. Peter is supposed to have celebrated mass in the\r\nhouse of Pudens.[280] The steps of the altar (at the top of which the\r\npope is installed) have an allegorical enamelled border with emblems of\r\nan asp, a dragon, a lion, and basilisk, in allusion to Psalm xci.\r\n\r\nIn the confession, in front of the altar, is the bronze tomb of Martin\r\nV., Oddone Colonna (1417--24), the wise and just pope who was elected at\r\nthe Council of Constance to put an end to the schism which had long\r\ndivided the papacy, and which had almost reduced the capital of the\r\nChurch to ruins. A bronze slab bears his figure, in low-relief, and is a\r\nfine work of _Antonio Filarete_, author of the bronze doors at St.\r\nPeter's. It bears the appropriate surname which was given to this\r\njustly-loved pope--\"Temporum suorum felicitas.\"\r\n\r\nThe tribune is of the time of Nicholas IV. (1287--1292). Above the arch\r\nis a grand mosaic head of the Saviour, attributed to the time of\r\nConstantine, and evidently of the fourth century,--of great interest on\r\nthis spot, as commemorating the vision of the Redeemer, who is said to\r\nhave appeared here on the day of the consecration of the church by\r\nSylvester and Constantine, looking down upon the people, and solemnly\r\nhallowing the work with his visible presence. The head, which is grand\r\nand sad in expression, is surrounded by six-winged seraphim. Below is an\r\nornamented cross, above which hovers a dove--from whose beak, running\r\ndown the cross, flow the waters which supply the four rivers of\r\nParadise. The disciples, as harts (panting for the water-brooks) and\r\nsheep, flock to drink of the waters of life. In the distance is the New\r\nJerusalem, within which the Phœnix, the bird of eternity, is seated\r\nupon the tree of Life, guarded by an angel with a two-edged sword.\r\nBeside the cross stand, on the left, the Virgin with her hand resting on\r\nthe head of the kneeling pope, Nicholas IV.; St. Peter with a scroll\r\ninscribed, \"Tu es Christus filius Dei vivi;\" St. Paul with a scroll\r\ninscribed, \"Salvatorem expectamus Dominum Jesum.\" On the right St. John\r\nthe Baptist, St. John the Evangelist, St. Andrew (all with their names).\r\nBetween the first and second of these figures are others, on a smaller\r\nscale, of St. Francis and St. Anthony of Padua. All these persons are\r\nrepresented as walking in a flowery Paradise, in which the souls of the\r\nblessed are besporting, and in front of which flows the Jordan. Below,\r\nbetween the windows, are figures of prophets, and (very small) of two\r\nFranciscans, who were the artists of the lower portion of the mosaic, as\r\nis shown by the inscriptions, \"Jacobus Turriti, pictor, hoc opus\r\nfecit;\"--\"Fra Jacobus de Camerino socius magistri.\"\r\n\r\nBehind the tribune, is all that remains internally of the architecture\r\nof the tenth century, in the vaulted passage called \"Portico Leonino,\"\r\nfrom its founder, Leo I. It is supported on low marble and granite\r\ncolumns with Ionic and Corinthian capitals. Here are collected a variety\r\nof relics of the ancient basilica. On either side of the entrance are\r\nmosaic tablets, which relate to the building of the church. Then, on the\r\nright, is a curious kneeling statue of Pope Nicholas IV., Masci\r\n(1287--92). On the left, in the centre, is an altar, above which is an\r\nancient crucifix, and on either side tenth century statues of SS. Peter\r\nand Paul.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the entrance to the sacristy (whose inner bronze doors\r\ndate from 1196), which contains an Annunciation by _Sebastian del\r\nPiombo_, and a sketch by _Raphael_ for the Madonna, called \"Della Casa\r\nd'Alba,\" now at St. Petersburg; also an ancient bas-relief, which\r\nrepresents the old and humble basilica of Pope Sergius. On the left, at\r\nthe end of the passage, is a very handsome cinquecento ciborium, and\r\nnear it the \"Tabula Magna Lateranensis,\" containing the list of relics\r\nbelonging to the church.\r\n\r\nNear this, opening from the transept, is the _Capella del Coro_, with\r\nhandsome wooden stallwork. It contains a portrait of Martin V., by\r\n_Scipione Gaetani_.\r\n\r\nThe altar of the Sacrament, which closes the transept, has four fluted\r\nbronze columns, said to have been brought from Jerusalem by Titus, and\r\nto be hollow and filled with earth from Palestine.[281] The last chapel\r\nin the left aisle is the _Corsini Chapel_, erected in 1729 in honour of\r\nSt. Andrea Corsini, from designs of Alessandro Galilei. It is in the\r\nform of a Greek cross, and ranks next to the Borghese Chapel in the\r\nrichness of its marble decoration. The mosaic altar-piece, representing\r\nS. Andrea Corsini, is a copy from _Guido_. The founder of the chapel,\r\nClement XII., Lorenzo Corsini (1730--40), is buried in a splendid\r\nporphyry sarcophagus which he plundered from the Pantheon. Above it is a\r\nbronze statue of the pope.[282] Opposite is the tomb of Cardinal Neri\r\nCorsini, with a number of statues of the Bernini school.\r\n\r\nBeneath the chapel is a vault lined with sarcophagi of the Corsini. Its\r\naltar is surmounted by a magnificent Pietà--in whose beautiful and\r\nimpressive figures it is difficult to recognise a work of the usually\r\ncoarse and theatrical artist _Bernini_.\r\n\r\n     Of the many tombs of mediæval popes which formerly existed in this\r\n     basilica,[283] none remain, except the memorial slab and epitaph of\r\n     Sylvester II., Gerbert (999--1003). This pope is said (by the\r\n     chronicler Martin Polonus de Corenza) to have been a kind of\r\n     magician, who obtained first the archbishopric of Rheims, then that\r\n     of Ravenna, and then the papacy, by the aid of the devil, to whom,\r\n     in return, he promised to belong after death. When he ascended the\r\n     throne, he asked the devil how long he could reign, and the devil,\r\n     as is his custom, answered by a double-entendre, \"If you never\r\n     enter Jerusalem, you will reign a long time.\" He occupied the\r\n     throne for four years, one month, and ten days, when, one day, as\r\n     he was officiating in the basilica of Sta. Croce in Gerusalemme, he\r\n     saw that he had passed the fatal threshold, and that his death was\r\n     impending. Overwhelmed with repentance, he confessed his\r\n     backslidings before the people, and exhorted them to lay aside\r\n     pride, to resist the temptations of the devil, and to lead a good\r\n     life. After this he begged of his attendants to cut his body in\r\n     pieces after he was dead, as he deserved, and to place it on a\r\n     common cart, and bury it wherever the horses stopped of their own\r\n     accord. Then was manifested the will of the Divine Providence, that\r\n     repentant sinners should learn that their God preserves for them a\r\n     place of pardon even in this life,--for the horses went of their\r\n     own accord to St. John Lateran, where he was buried. \"Since then,\"\r\n     says Platina, \"the rattling of his bones, and the sweat, or rather\r\n     the damp, with which his tomb becomes covered, has always been the\r\n     infallible sign and forerunner of the death of a pope\"!\r\n\r\nAgainst the second pillar of the right aisle, counting from the west\r\ndoor, is a very interesting fresco of _Giotto_, originally one of many\r\npaintings executed by him for the loggia of the adjoining papal palace,\r\nwhence the benediction and \"plenary indulgence\" were given in the\r\njubilee year. It represents Boniface VIII. (Benedetto Gaetani,\r\n1294--1303), the founder of the jubilee, between two priests.\r\n\r\n     \"On y voit Boniface annonçant au peuple le jubilé. Le portrait du\r\n     pape doit être ressemblant. J'ai reconnu dans cette physiognomie,\r\n     où il y a plus de finesse que de force, la statue que j'avais vue\r\n     couchée sur le tombeau de ce pape, dans les souterrains du\r\n     Vatican.\"--_Ampère, Voyage Dantesque._\r\n\r\nOpening from this aisle are several chapels. The second is that of the\r\nnewly established and rich family of Torlonia, which contains a marble\r\nPietà, by Tenerani, and some handsome modern monuments. The third is\r\nthat of the Massimi (designed by Giacomo della Porta), which has, as an\r\naltar-piece, the Crucifixion by _Sermoneta_. Beyond this, in the right\r\naisle, are several remarkable tombs of cardinals, among which is the\r\ntomb of Cardinal Guissano, who died in 1287. The painters Cav. d'Arpino\r\nand Andrea Sacchi are buried in this church.\r\n\r\nEntered from the last chapel in the left aisle (by a door which the\r\nsacristan will open) is the beautiful twelfth century _Cloister of the\r\nMonastery_, surrounded by low arches supported on exquisite inlaid and\r\ntwisted columns, above which is a lovely frieze of coloured marbles. The\r\ncourt thus enclosed is a garden of roses; in the centre is a well\r\n(adorned with crosses) of the tenth century, called the \"Well of the\r\nWoman of Samaria.\" In the cloister is a collection of architectural and\r\ntraditional relics, including a beautiful old white marble throne,\r\ninlaid with mosaics, a candelabrum resting on a lion, and several other\r\nexquisitely wrought details from the old basilica; also a porphyry slab\r\nupon which the soldiers are said to have cast lots for the seamless\r\nrobe; columns which were rent by the earthquake of the Crucifixion; a\r\nslab, resting on pillars, shown as a measure of the height of Our\r\nSaviour,[284] and a smaller slab, also on pillars, of which it is said\r\nthat it was once an altar, at which the officiating priest doubted of\r\nthe Real Presence, when the wafer fell from his hand through the stone,\r\nleaving a round hole which still remains.\r\n\r\nFive General Councils have been held at the Lateran, viz.:--\r\n\r\n     I.--March 19, 1123, under Calixtus II., with regard to the\r\n     Investiture.\r\n\r\n     II.--April 18, 1139, under Innocent II., to condemn the doctrines\r\n     of Arnold of Brescia and Peter de Bruys, and to oppose the\r\n     anti-pope Anacletus II.\r\n\r\n     III.--March 5, 1179, under Alexander III., to condemn the\r\n     doctrines of Waldenses and Albigenses, and to end the schism\r\n     caused by Frederick Barbarossa.\r\n\r\n     IV.--Nov. 11, 1215, at which 400 bishops assembled under Innocent\r\n     III., to condemn the Albigenses, and the heresies of the Abbot\r\n     Joachim.\r\n\r\n     V.--May 3, 1512, under Julius II. and Leo X., at which the\r\n     Pragmatic Sanction was abolished, and a Concordat concluded between\r\n     the Pope and Francis I. for the destruction of the liberties of the\r\n     Gallican Church.\r\n\r\nIt is in the basilica of the Lateran that the Church places the first\r\nmeeting between St. Francis and St Dominic.\r\n\r\n     \"Une nuit, pendant que Dominique dormait, il lui sembla voir\r\n     Jésus-Christ se préparant à exterminer les superbes, les\r\n     voluptueux, les avares, lorsque tout-à-coup la Vierge l'apaisa en\r\n     lui présentant deux hommes: l'un d'eux lui-même; quant à l'autre,\r\n     il ne le connaissait pas; mais le lendemain, la première personne\r\n     qu'il aperçut, en entrant au Latran, fut l'inconnu qui lui était\r\n     apparu en songe. Il était couvert de haillons et priait avec\r\n     ferveur. Dominique se précipita dans ses bras, et l'embrassant avec\r\n     effusion: 'Tu es mon compagnon,' lui dit-il; 'nous courons la même\r\n     carrière, demeurons ensemble, et aucun ennemi ne prévaudra contre\r\n     nous.' Et, à partir de ce moment, dit la légende, ils n'eurent plus\r\n     qu'un cœur et qu'une âme dans le Seigneur. Ce pauvre, ce\r\n     mendiant, était saint François d'Assise.\"--_Gournerie, Rome\r\n     Chrétienne._\r\n\r\nIssuing from the west door of the basilica, we find ourselves in a wide\r\nportico, one of whose five doors is a Porta Santa. At the end, is\r\nappropriately placed an ancient marble statue of Constantine, who is in\r\nthe dress of a Roman warrior, bearing the _labarum_, or standard of the\r\ncross, which is here represented as a lance surmounted by the monogram\r\nof Christ. From this portico we look down upon one of the most beautiful\r\nand characteristic views in Rome. On one side are the Alban Hills, blue\r\nin morning, or purple in evening light, sprinkled with white villages of\r\nhistoric interest--Albano, Rocca di Papa, Marino, Frescati, Colonna; on\r\nthe other side are the Sabine Mountains, tipped with snow; in the\r\nmiddle distance the long, golden-hued lines of aqueducts stretch away\r\nover the plain, till they are lost in the pink haze, and nearer still\r\nare the desolate basilica of Santa Croce, the fruit gardens of the Villa\r\nWolkonski, interspersed with rugged fragments of massive brickwork, and\r\nthe glorious old walls of the city itself. The road at our feet is the\r\nVia Appia Nuova, which leads to Naples, and which immediately passes\r\nthrough the modern gate of Rome, known as the Porta _San Giovanni_\r\n(built in the sixteenth century by Gregory XIII.). Nearer to us, on the\r\nright, is an ancient gateway, the finest on the Aurelian wall, bricked\r\nup by Ladislaus, king of Naples, in 1408. By this gate, known as the\r\n_Porta Asinaria_, from the family of the Asinarii, Belisarius entered\r\nRome in 505, and Totila, through the treachery of the Isaurian Guard, in\r\n546. Here also, in 1084, Henry IV. entered Rome against Hildebrand with\r\nhis anti-pope Guibert; and, a few years after, the name of the gate\r\nitself was changed to Porta Perusta, in consequence of the injuries it\r\nreceived from Robert Guiscard, who came to the rescue of the lawful\r\npontiff.\r\n\r\nThe broad open space which we see beneath the steps was the favourite\r\nwalk of the mediæval popes.\r\n\r\n     \"The splendid palace of the Lateran reflected the rays of the\r\n     evening sun, as Francis of Assisi with two or three of his\r\n     disciples approached it to obtain the papal sanction for the rules\r\n     of his new Order. A group of churchmen in sumptuous apparel were\r\n     traversing with slow and measured steps its lofty terrace, then\r\n     called 'the Mirror,' as if afraid to overtake him who preceded\r\n     them, in a dress studiously simple, and with a countenance wrapped\r\n     in earnest meditation. Unruffled by passion, and yet elate with\r\n     conscious power, that eagle eye, and those capacious brows,\r\n     announced him the lord of a dominion which might have satisfied the\r\n     pride of Diogenes, and the ambition of Alexander. Since the\r\n     Tugurium was built on the Capitoline, no greater monarch had ever\r\n     called the seven hills his own. But, in his pontificate, no era had\r\n     occurred more arduous than that in which Innocent III. saw the\r\n     mendicants of Assisi prostrate at his feet. The interruption was as\r\n     unwelcome as it was abrupt; as he gazed at the squalid dress and\r\n     faces of his suitors, and observed their bare and unwashed feet,\r\n     his lip curled with disdain, and sternly commanding them to\r\n     withdraw, he seemed again to retire from the outer world into some\r\n     of the deep recesses of that capacious mind. Francis and his\r\n     companions betook themselves to prayer; Innocent to his couch.\r\n     There (says the legend) he dreamed that a palm-tree sprouted up\r\n     from the ground beneath his feet, and, swiftly shooting up into the\r\n     heavens, cast her boughs on every side, a shelter from the heat,\r\n     and a refreshment to the weary. The vision of the night dictated\r\n     the policy of the morning, and assured Innocent that, under his\r\n     fostering care, the Franciscan palm would strike deep her roots,\r\n     and expand her foliage on every side, in the vineyard of the\r\n     Church.\"--_Stephens' St. Francis of Assisi._\r\n\r\nThe western façade of the basilica, built by Alessandro Galilei in 1734,\r\nhas a fine effect at a distance, but the statues of Christ and the\r\napostles which line its parapet are too large for its proportions.\r\n\r\n_The ancient Palace of the Lateran_ was the residence of the popes for\r\nnearly 1000 years. Almost all the events affecting the private lives of\r\na vast line of ecclesiastical sovereigns happened within its walls.\r\nPlundered in each successive invasion, stricken with malaria during the\r\nautumn months, and often partially burnt, it was finally destroyed by\r\nthe great enemy of Roman antiquities, Sixtus V. Among the scenes which\r\noccurred within its walls, perhaps the most terrible was that when John\r\nX., the completer of the Lateran basilica, was invaded here by Marozia,\r\nwho was beginning to seize the chief power in Rome, and who carried the\r\npope off prisoner to St. Angelo, after he had seen his brother Peter\r\nmurdered before his eyes in the hall of the pontifical palace.\r\n\r\nThe only remnants preserved of this famous building are the private\r\nchapel of the popes, and the end wall of their dining-hall, known as the\r\n_Triclinium_, which contains a copy, erected by Benedict XIV., of the\r\nancient mosaic of the time of Leo III. which formerly existed here, and\r\nthe remains of which are preserved in the Vatican.\r\n\r\n     \"In this mosaic, Hallam (Middle Ages) sees proof that the authority\r\n     of the Greek Emperor was not entirely abrogated at Rome till long\r\n     after the period of papal aggrandisement by Pepin and his son, but\r\n     he is warranted by no probabilities in concluding that Constantine\r\n     V., whose reign began A.D. 780, is intended by the emperor kneeling\r\n     with St. Peter or Pope Sylvester.\"--_Hemans' Ancient Christian\r\n     Art._\r\n\r\nProfessor Bryce finds two paintings in which the theory of the mediæval\r\nempire is unmistakeably set forth; one of them in Rome, the other in\r\nFlorence, (a fresco in the chapter-house of S. M. Novella).\r\n\r\n     \"The first of these is the famous mosaic of the Lateran triclinium,\r\n     constructed by Pope Leo III., about A.D. 800, and an exact copy of\r\n     which, made by the order of Sixtus V., may still be seen over\r\n     against the facade of St. John Lateran. Originally meant to adorn\r\n     the state banqueting-hall of the popes, it is now placed in the\r\n     open air, in the finest situation in Rome, looking from the brow of\r\n     a hill across the green ridges of the Campagna to the olive groves\r\n     of Tivoli and the glistering crags and snow-capped summits of the\r\n     Umbrian and Sabine Apennine. It represents in the centre Christ\r\n     surrounded by the apostles, whom He is sending forth to preach the\r\n     gospel; one hand is extended to bless, the other holds a book with\r\n     the words 'Pax vobis.' Below and to the right Christ is depicted\r\n     again, and this time sitting: on His right hand kneels Pope\r\n     Sylvester, on His left the Emperor Constantine; to the one He gives\r\n     the keys of heaven and hell, to the other a banner surmounted by a\r\n     cross. In the group on the opposite, that is, on the left side of\r\n     the arch, we see the Apostle Peter seated, before whom in like\r\n     manner kneel Pope Leo III. and Charles the Emperor; the latter\r\n     wearing, like Constantine, his crown. Peter, himself grasping the\r\n     keys, gives to Leo the pallium of an archbishop, to Charles the\r\n     banner of the Christian army. The inscription is 'Beatus Petrus\r\n     dona vitam Leoni P. Pet victoriam Carulo regi dona;' while round\r\n     the arch is written, 'Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax\r\n     omnibus bonæ voluntatis.'\r\n\r\n     \"The order and nature of the ideas here symbolized is sufficiently\r\n     clear. First comes the revelation of the gospel, and the divine\r\n     commission to gather all men into its fold. Next, the institution,\r\n     at the memorable era of Constantine's conversion, of the two powers\r\n     by which the Christian people is to be respectively taught and\r\n     governed. Thirdly, we are shown the permanent Vicar of God, the\r\n     apostle who keeps the keys of heaven and hell, re-establishing\r\n     these same powers on a new and firmer basis. The badge of\r\n     ecclesiastical supremacy he gives to Leo as the spiritual head of\r\n     the faithful on earth, the banner of the Church militant to\r\n     Charles, who is to maintain her cause against heretics and\r\n     infidels.\"--_J. Bryce_, _Holy Roman Empire_, ch. vii. pp. 117, 118,\r\n     3rd ed., 1871.\r\n\r\nIn the building behind the Triclinium, attached to a convent of\r\nPassionist monks, and erected by Fontana for Sixtus V., is preserved\r\n_the Santa Scala_. This famous staircase, supposed to be that of the\r\nhouse of Pilate, ascended and descended by our Saviour, is said to have\r\nbeen brought from Jerusalem by Helena, mother of Constantine the Great,\r\nand has been regarded with especial reverence by the Roman Church for\r\n1500 years. In 897 it was injured and partially thrown down by an\r\nearthquake, but was re-erected in the old Lateran palace, whence it was\r\nremoved to its present site on the demolition of that venerable\r\nbuilding. Clement XII. caused the steps to be covered by a wooden\r\ncasing, which has since been repeatedly worn out by the knees of\r\nascending pilgrims. Apertures are left, through which the marble steps\r\ncan be seen; two of them are said to be stained with the blood of the\r\nSaviour!\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the stairs, within the atrium, are fine sculptures of\r\n_Giacometti_, representing the \"Ecce Homo,\"--and the \"Kiss of Judas,\"\r\npurchased and placed here by Pius IX.\r\n\r\nBetween these statues the pilgrims kneel to commence the ascent of the\r\nSanta Scala. The effect of the staircase (especially on Fridays in Lent,\r\nand most of all on Good Friday), with the figures ascending on their\r\nknees in the dim light, and the dark vaulted ceiling covered with faded\r\nfrescoes, is exceedingly picturesque.\r\n\r\n     \"Reason may condemn, but feeling cannot resist the claim to\r\n     reverential sympathy in the spectacle daily presented by the Santa\r\n     Scala. Numerous indulgences have been granted by different popes to\r\n     those who ascend it with prayer at each step. Whilst kneeling upon\r\n     these stairs public penance used to be performed in the days of the\r\n     Church's more rigorous discipline; as the saintly matron Fabiola\r\n     there appeared a penitent before the public gaze, in sackcloth and\r\n     ashes, A.D. 390.... There is no day on which worshippers may not be\r\n     seen slowly ascending those stairs; but it is during Holy Week the\r\n     concourse is at its height; and on Good Friday I have seen this\r\n     structure completely covered by the multitude, like a swarm of bees\r\n     settling on flowers!\"--_Hemans' Ancient Sacred Art._\r\n\r\n     \"Brother Martin Luther went to accomplish the ascent of the Santa\r\n     Scala--the Holy Staircase--which once, they say, formed part of\r\n     Pilate's house. He slowly mounted step after step of the hard\r\n     stone, worn into hollows by the knees of penitents and pilgrims. An\r\n     indulgence for a thousand years--indulgence from penance--is\r\n     attached to this act of devotion. Patiently he crept half-way up\r\n     the staircase, when he suddenly stood erect, lifted his face\r\n     heavenward, and, in another moment, turned and walked slowly down\r\n     again.\r\n\r\n     \"He said that, as he was toiling up, a voice as if from heaven,\r\n     seemed to whisper to him the old, well-known words, which had been\r\n     his battle-cry in so many a victorious combat,--'The just shall\r\n     live by faith.'\r\n\r\n     \"He seemed awakened, as if from a nightmare, and restored to\r\n     himself. He dared not creep up another step; but, rising from his\r\n     knees, he stood upright, like a man suddenly loosed from bonds and\r\n     fetters, and with the firm step of a freeman, he descended the\r\n     staircase, and walked from the place.\"--_Schönberg-Cotta\r\n     Chronicles._\r\n\r\n     \"Did the feet of the Saviour actually tread these steps? Are these\r\n     reliques really portions of his cross, crown of thorns, &c., or is\r\n     all this fictitious? To me it is all one.\r\n\r\n     \"'He is not here, he is risen!' said the angel at the tomb. The\r\n     worship of the bodily covering which the spirit has cast off\r\n     belongs to the soul still in the larva condition; and the ascending\r\n     of the Scala Santa on the knees is too convenient a mode for\r\n     obtaining the forgiveness of sins, and at the same time a hindrance\r\n     upon the only true way.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\nAscending one of the lateral staircases--no _foot_ must touch the Santa\r\nScala--we reach the outside of the _Sancta Sanctorum_, a chapel held so\r\nintensely sacred that none but the pope can officiate at its altar, and\r\nthat it is _never_ open to others, except on the morning before Palm\r\nSunday, when the canons of the Lateran come hither to worship, in solemn\r\nprocession, with torches and a veiled crucifix, and, even then, none but\r\nthe clergy are allowed to pass its threshold. The origin of the\r\nsanctuary is lost in antiquity, but it was the private chapel of the\r\nmediæval popes in the old palace, and is known to have existed already,\r\ndedicated to St. Laurence, in the time of Pelagius I. (578--590), who\r\ndeposited here some relics of St. Andrew and St. Luke. It was restored\r\nby Honorius III. in 1216, and almost rebuilt by Nicholas III. in 1277.\r\n\r\nIt is permitted to gaze through a grating upon the picturesque glories\r\nof the interior, which are chiefly of the thirteenth century. The altar\r\nis in a recess, supported by two porphyry columns. Above it a beautiful\r\nsilver tabernacle, presented by Innocent III. (1198-1216), to contain\r\nthe great relic, which invests the chapel with its peculiar sanctity,--a\r\nportrait of our Saviour (placed here by Stephen III. in 752), held by\r\nthe Roman Church as authentic,--to have been begun by St. Luke and\r\nfinished by an angel, whence the name by which it is known,\r\n\"Acheirotopeton,\" or, the \"picture made without hands.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The different theories as to the acheirotopeton picture, and the\r\n     manner in which it reached this city, are stated with naïveté by\r\n     Maroni--_i.e._, that the apostles and the Madonna, meeting after\r\n     the ascension, resolved to order a portrait of the Crucified, for\r\n     satisfying the desire of the faithful, and commissioned St. Luke to\r\n     execute the task; that after three days' prayer and fasting, such a\r\n     portrait was drawn in outline by that artist, but, before he had\r\n     begun to colour, the tints were found to have been filled in by\r\n     invisible hands; that this picture was brought from Jerusalem to\r\n     Rome, either by St. Peter, or by Titus (together with the sacred\r\n     spoils of the temple); or else expedited hither in a miraculous\r\n     voyage of only twenty-four hours by S. Germanus, patriarch of\r\n     Constantinople, who desired thus to save such a treasure from the\r\n     outrages of the Iconoclasts; and that, about A.D. 726, Pope Gregory\r\n     II., apprised of its arrival at the mouth of the Tiber by\r\n     revelation, proceeded to carry it thence, with due escort, to Rome;\r\n     since which advent it has remained in the Sancta\r\n     Sanctorum.\"--_Hemans' Mediæval Christian Art._\r\n\r\nAbove the altar is, in gilt letters, the inscription, \"non est in tota\r\nsanctior urbe locus.\" Higher up, under gothic arches, and between\r\ntwisted columns, are pictures of sainted popes and martyrs, but these\r\nhave been so much retouched as to have lost their interest. The gratings\r\nhere are those of the relic chamber, which contains the reputed sandals\r\nof Our Saviour, fragments of the true cross, &c. On the ceiling is a\r\ngrand mosaic,--a head of Our Saviour within a nimbus, sustained by\r\nsix-winged seraphim--ascribed to the eighth century. The sill in front\r\nof the screen is covered with money, thrown in as offerings by the\r\npilgrims.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was once much larger. Its architect was probably Deodatus\r\nCosmati. An inscription near the door tells us, \"Magister Cosmatus fecit\r\nhoc opus.\"\r\n\r\nHere, in the time when the Lateran palace was inhabited, the feet of\r\ntwelve sub-deacons were annually washed by the pope on Holy Thursday. On\r\nthe Feast of the Assumption the sacred picture used to be borne in\r\ntriumph through the city, halting in the Forum, where the feet of the\r\npope were washed in perfumed waters on the steps of Sta. Maria Nuova,\r\nand the \"Kyrie Eleison\" was chaunted a hundred times. This custom was\r\nabolished by Pius V. in 1566.\r\n\r\nThe _Modern Palace of the Lateran_ was built from designs of Fontana by\r\nSixtus V. In 1693 Innocent XII. turned it into a hospital,--in 1438\r\nGregory XVI. appropriated it as a museum. The entrance faces the obelisk\r\nin the Piazza di San Giovanni. The palace is always shown, but the\r\nterrible cold which pervades it makes it a dangerous place except in the\r\nlate spring months, and a visit to it is often productive of fever.\r\n\r\nThe ground floor is the principal receptacle for antiquities, found at\r\nRome within the last few years. It contains a number of very beautiful\r\nsarcophagi and bas-reliefs.\r\n\r\nEntering under the corridor on the right, the most remarkable objects\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n     _1st Room._--\r\n\r\n     LEFT WALL:\r\n\r\n     Relief of the Abduction of Helen.\r\n\r\n     RIGHT WALL:\r\n\r\n     High relief of two pugilists, 'Dares and Entellus.'\r\n\r\n     Grand relief of Trajan followed by senators, from the Forum of\r\n     Trajan.\r\n\r\n     The sacred oak of Jupiter, with figures.\r\n\r\n     Bust of Marcus Aurelius.\r\n\r\n     _2nd Room._--\r\n\r\n     Beautiful architectural fragments, chiefly from the Forum of\r\n     Trajan.\r\n\r\n     _3rd Room._--\r\n\r\n     ENTRANCE WALL:\r\n\r\n     Statue of Æsculapius.\r\n\r\n     RIGHT WALL:\r\n\r\n     Statue of Antinous, called the Braschi, found at Palestrina.\r\n\r\n     Bought from the Braschi family by Gregory XVI for 12,000 scudi.\r\n\r\n     WALL OF EGRESS:\r\n\r\n     Sarcophagus of a child, with a relief representing pugilists.\r\n\r\n     _4th Room._--\r\n\r\n     ENTRANCE WALL:\r\n\r\n     Greek relief of Medea and the daughters of Peleus.\r\n\r\n     Above (one of a number of busts), 762.

In the first hall\r\nis a statue of Christ by _Sosnowsky_, and in the wall behind it three\r\nmosaics,--two from the catacombs, that in the centre--of Christ with SS.\r\nPeter and Paul--from the old St. Peter's. Hence we ascend a staircase\r\nlined with Christian sarcophagi. At the foot are two statues of the Good\r\nShepherd.\r\n\r\n     \"Une des compositions de Calamis ne doit pas être oubliée à Rome,\r\n     car ce sujet païen a été adopté par l'art chrétien des premiers\r\n     temps. Les représentations du _Bon Pasteur rapportant la brebis_,\r\n     expressions touchante de la miséricorde divine, ont leur origine\r\n     dans le _Mercure porte-bélier_ (Criophore). Quelquefois c'est un\r\n     _berger_ qui porte un bélier, une brebis ou un agneau; l'on se\r\n     rapproche ainsi a l'idée du _bon pasteur_. En général, le bon\r\n     pasteur, dans les monuments chrétiens, porte une _brebis_, la\r\n     brebis égarée de l'Évangile; mais quelquefois aussi il porte _un\r\n     bélier_; et alors le souvenir de l'original païen dans la\r\n     composition chrétienne est manifeste.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii.\r\n     256.\r\n\r\nThe sarcophagus on the left, which tells the story of Jonah, is\r\nespecially fine. The corridor above is also lined with sarcophagi. The\r\nbest are on the left; of these the most remarkable are, the 1st, the\r\nmarriage at Cana; 4th, the Good Shepherd repeated several times among\r\nvines, with cherubs gathering the grapes; 7th, a sarcophagus with a\r\ncanopy supported by two pavonazzetto columns, and on the wall behind,\r\nfrescoes of the Good Shepherd, &c. At the raised end of the corridor is\r\nthe seated statue of Hippolytus, Bishop of Porto in the third century\r\n(the upper part a restoration), found in the Catacomb of Sta. Cyriaca,\r\nand moved hither from the Vatican Library; upon the chair is engraved\r\nthe celebrated Paschal Calendar, which is supposed to settle the\r\nunorthodoxy of those early Christians who kept Easter at the same time\r\nas the Jews.\r\n\r\nHence, three rooms lined with drawings from the paintings in the\r\ndifferent catacombs, lead to,--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PICTURE GALLERY.\r\n\r\n     _1st Room._--\r\n\r\n     ENTRANCE WALL:\r\n\r\n     Cartoon of stoning of Stephen: _Giulio Romano_.\r\n\r\n     Below this is the celebrated mosaic called _Asarotos_, representing\r\n     an unswept floor after a banquet. It is inscribed with the name of\r\n     its artist, _Heraclitus_, but is a copy from one of the two famous\r\n     mosaics of Sosus of Pergamus (the other is \"Pliny's Doves\"). It was\r\n     found on the Aventine in 1833 in the gardens of Servilius, and\r\n     \"probably adorned a dining-room where Cæsar may have supped with\r\n     Servilia, the sister of Cato, and mother of Brutus.\" A similar\r\n     pavement is alluded to by Statius:--\r\n\r\n                \"Varias ubi picta per artes\r\n    Gaudet humus superare novis asarota figuris.\"\r\n\r\n    _Sylv._ i. 3, 55.\r\n\r\n     LEFT WALL:\r\n\r\n     Christ and St Thomas--a cartoon: _Camuccini_.\r\n\r\n     WINDOW WALL:\r\n\r\n     The first sketch for the famous fresco of the Descent from the\r\n     Cross at the Trinità de' Monti: _Daniele da Volterra_.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the entrance of the\r\n\r\n     _2nd Room._--\r\n\r\n     ENTRANCE WALL:\r\n\r\n     Annunciation: _Cav. d' Arpino_.\r\n\r\n     RIGHT WALL:\r\n\r\n     George IV. of England (most strangely out of place): _Lawrence_.\r\n\r\n     WALL OF EGRESS:\r\n\r\n     Assumption of the Virgin: _After Guercino_.\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of this room, on the right, a staircase leads to a\r\ngallery, whence one may look down upon the huge and hideous mosaic\r\npavement--with portraits of twenty-eight athletes--found in the Baths of\r\nCaracalla in 1822.\r\n\r\n     \"Les gladiateurs de la mosaïque de Saint Jean de Latran ont reçu la\r\n     forte alimentation qu'on donnait à leurs pareils; ils ont bien cet\r\n     air de résolution brutale que devaient avoir ceux qui prononçaient\r\n     ce féroce serment que nous a conservé Pétrone: 'Nous jurons d'obéir\r\n     à nôtre maître Eumolpe, qu'il nous ordonne de nous laisser brûler,\r\n     enchaîner, frapper, tuer par le fer ou autrement; et comme vrais\r\n     gladiateurs, nous dévouons à notre maître nos corps et nos\r\n     vies.'\"--_Ampère, Hist.

Epitaphs of martyrs and others of temp. Damasus I. (366 to 384).\r\n    4--7. Dated inscriptions from 238 to 557.\r\n    8--9.

He instituted the school for it in the Lateran, whence the\r\n     Carlovingian monarchs obtained teachers of singing and\r\n     organ-playing. The Frankish monks were sent thither for\r\n     instruction.\"--_Dyer's Hist. of the City of Rome._\r\n\r\nOpposite the palace is the entrance of the _Villa Massimo Arsoli_, to\r\nwhich admission may be obtained by a permesso given at the Palazzo\r\nMassimo alle Colonne. There is little to see here, however, except a\r\ncasino beautifully decorated with scenes taken from the great Italian\r\npoets by the modern German artists, Schnorr, Kock, Ph.

Maria Maggiore is the\r\nVia Immerulana, where, in the hollow, is the strange-looking _Church of\r\nSS. Pietro e Marcellino_, in which is preserved a miraculous painting of\r\nthe Crucifixion; the figure upon the cross is supposed to move the eyes,\r\nwhen regarded by the faithful. This picture, a small replica of the\r\nmagnificent Guido at S. Lorenzo in Lucina, is shown, behind a grille, by\r\na nun of Sta. Theresa, veiled from head to foot in blue, like an\r\nimmovable pillar of blue drapery.\r\n\r\n     \"SS. Pietro e Marcellino stands in the valley behind the Esquiline,\r\n     in the long, lonely road between Sta. Maria Maggiore and the\r\n     Lateran. SS. Peter Exorcista and Marcellinus are always represented\r\n     together in priestly habits, bearing their palms. Their legend\r\n     relates, that in the persecution under Diocletian they were cast\r\n     into prison. Artemius, keeper of the dungeon, had a daughter named\r\n     Paulina, and she fell sick; and St. Peter offered to restore her\r\n     to health, if her father would believe in the true God. And the\r\n     jailer mocked him, saying, 'If I put thee into the deepest dungeon,\r\n     and load thee with heavier chains, will thy God deliver thee? If he\r\n     doth, I will believe in him.' And Peter answered, 'Be it so, not\r\n     out of regard to thee; for it matters little to our God whether\r\n     such an one as thou believe in him or not, but that the name of\r\n     Christ may be glorified, and thyself confounded.'\r\n\r\n     \"And in the middle of the night Peter and Marcellinus, in white\r\n     shining garments, entered the chamber of Artemius as he lay asleep,\r\n     who, being struck with awe, fell down and worshipped the name of\r\n     Christ; and he, his wife, daughter, and three hundred others, were\r\n     baptized. After this the two holy men were condemned to die for the\r\n     faith, and the executioner was ordered to lead them to a forest\r\n     three miles from Rome, that the Christians might not discover their\r\n     place of sepulture. And when he had brought them to a solitary\r\n     thicket overgrown with brambles and thorns, he declared to them\r\n     that they were to die, upon which they cheerfully fell to work and\r\n     cleared away a space fit for the purpose, and dug the grave in\r\n     which they were to be laid. Then they were beheaded (June 2), and\r\n     died encouraging each other.\r\n\r\n     \"The fame of SS. Pietro e Marcellino is not confined to Rome. In\r\n     the reign of Charlemagne they were venerated as martyrs throughout\r\n     Italy and Gaul; and Eginhard, the secretary of Charlemagne who\r\n     married his daughter Emma, is said to have held them in particular\r\n     honour. Every one, I believe, knows the beautiful story of Eginhard\r\n     and Emma,--and the connection of these saints with them, as their\r\n     chosen protectors, lends an interest to their solitary deserted\r\n     church. In the Roma Sotterranea of Bosio, p. 126, there is an\r\n     ancient fragment found in the catacombs, which represents St. Peter\r\n     Exorcista, St. Marcellinus, and Paulina, standing together.\"--_Mrs.\r\n     Jameson._\r\n\r\nBehind the Santa Scala, a narrow lane leads to the _Villa Wolkonski_ (a\r\n\"permesso\" may be obtained through your banker), a most beautiful\r\ngarden, running along the edge of the hill, intersected by the broken\r\narches of the Aqua Claudia, and possessing exquisite views over the\r\nCampagna, with its lines of aqueducts to the Alban and Sabine mountains.\r\n_No one should omit to visit this villa._\r\n\r\n     \"Where the aqueducts, just about to enter the city, most nearly\r\n     converge, and looking across the Campagna--which their arches only\r\n     seem able to span--towards Albano and the hills, stands the Villa.\r\n     Embosomed in olive and in ilex trees, it is rich in hoar cypresses,\r\n     in urns, and in those pathetic fragments of old workmanship which\r\n     an undergrowth of violets and acanthus half hides, and half\r\n     reveals.\"--_Vera._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout a mile beyond the Porta S. Giovanni, a road branches off on the\r\nleft to the _Porta Furba_, an arch of the Aqua Felice, founded on the\r\nline of the Claudian and Marcian aqueducts. Artists may find a\r\npicturesque subject here in a pretty fountain, with a portion of the\r\ndecaying aqueduct. Beyond the arch is the mound called _Monte del\r\nGrano_, which has been imagined to be the burial-place of Alexander\r\nSeverus. Beyond this, the road (to Frescati) passes on the left the vast\r\nruins, called _Sette Bassi_.\r\n\r\nThe direct road--which leads to Albano--reaches, about two miles from\r\nthe gate, a queer building, called the Casa del Diavolo, on the outside\r\nof which some rude frescoes testify to the popular belief as to its\r\nowner. Just beyond this a field track on the left leads to the _Via\r\nLatina_, of which a certain portion, paved with huge polygonal blocks of\r\nlava, is now laid bare. Here are some exceedingly interesting and\r\nwell-preserved tombs, richly ornamented with painting and stucco. The\r\nview, looking back upon Rome, or forward to the long line of broken\r\narches of the Claudian aqueduct, seen between these ruined sepulchres,\r\nis most striking and beautiful.\r\n\r\nClose by have been discovered remains of a villa of the Servilii, which\r\nafterwards belonged to the Asinarii. Here also, in 1858 (on the left of\r\nthe Via Latina), Signor Fortunati discovered the long buried and\r\nforgotten _Basilica of S. Stefano_. It is recorded by Anastasius that\r\nthis basilica was founded in the time of Leo I. (440--461) by Demetria,\r\na lady who escaped from the siege by the Goths, with her mother, to\r\nCarthage, where she became a nun. It was restored by Leo III. at the end\r\nof the eighth century. The remains are interesting, though they do\r\nlittle more than show perfectly the substruction and plan of the ancient\r\nbuilding. An inscription relating to the foundation of the church by\r\nDemetria has been found among the ruins.\r\n\r\nNot far from this is the _Catacomb of the Santi-Quattro_.\r\n\r\nThree and a half miles from Rome is the Osteria of _Tavolato_, near\r\nwhich is one of the most striking and picturesque portions of the\r\nClaudian Aqueduct. It is on the rising ground between this aqueduct and\r\nthe road, that the _Temple of Fortuna Muliebris_ is believed to have\r\nstood. This was the temple which Valeria, the sister of Publicola, and\r\nVolumnia, the mother of Coriolanus, claimed to erect at their own\r\nexpense, when the senate asked them to choose their recompense for\r\nhaving preserved Rome by their entreaties.\r\n\r\n     \"As Valeria, sister of Publicola, was sitting in the temple, as a\r\n     suppliant before the image of Jupiter, Jupiter himself seemed to\r\n     inspire her with a sudden thought, and she immediately rose, and\r\n     called upon all the other noble ladies who were with her, to arise\r\n     also, and she led them to the house of Volumnia, the mother of\r\n     Caius (Coriolanus). There she found Virgilia, the wife of Caius,\r\n     with his mother, and also his little children. Valeria then\r\n     addressed Volumnia and Virgilia, and said, 'Our coming here to you\r\n     is our own doing; neither the senate nor any mortal man have sent\r\n     us; but the god in whose temple we were sitting as suppliants put\r\n     it into our hearts, that we should come and ask you to join with\r\n     us, women with women, without any aid of men, to win for our\r\n     country a great deliverance, and for ourselves a name, glorious\r\n     above all women, even above those Sabine wives in the old time, who\r\n     stopped the battle between their husbands and their fathers. Come,\r\n     then, with us to the camp of Caius, and let us pray to him to show\r\n     us mercy.' Volumnia said, 'We will go with you:' and Virgilia took\r\n     her young children with her, and they all went to the camp of the\r\n     enemy.\r\n\r\n     \"It was a sad and solemn sight to see this train of noble ladies,\r\n     and the very Volscian soldiers stood in silence as they passed by,\r\n     and pitied them and honoured them. They found Caius sitting on the\r\n     general's seat, in the midst of the camp, and the Volscian chiefs\r\n     were standing round him. When he first saw them he wondered what it\r\n     could be; but presently he knew his mother, who was walking at the\r\n     head of the train, and then he could not contain himself, but leapt\r\n     down from his seat, and ran to meet her, and was going to kiss her.\r\n     But she stopped him, and said, 'Ere thou kiss me, let me know\r\n     whether I am speaking to an enemy or to my son; whether I stand in\r\n     thy camp as thy prisoner or thy mother?' Caius could not answer\r\n     her; and then she went on and said, 'Must it be, then, that had I\r\n     never borne a son, Rome never would have seen the camp of an enemy;\r\n     that had I remained childless, I should have died a free woman in a\r\n     free city? But I am too old to bear much longer either thy shame or\r\n     my misery. Rather look to thy wife and children, whom, if thou\r\n     persistest, thou art dooming to an untimely death, or a long life\r\n     of bondage.' Then Virgilia and his children came up to him and\r\n     kissed him, and all the noble ladies wept, and bemoaned their own\r\n     fate and the fate of their country. At last Caius cried out, 'O\r\n     mother, what hast thou done to me?' and he wrung her hand\r\n     vehemently, and said, 'Mother, thine is the victory; a happy\r\n     victory for thee and for Rome, but shame and ruin to thy son.' Then\r\n     he fell on her neck and embraced her, and he embraced his wife and\r\n     his children, and sent them back to Rome; and led away the army of\r\n     the Volscians, and never afterwards attacked Rome any more. The\r\n     Romans, as was right, honoured Volumnia and Valeria for their deed,\r\n     and a temple was built and dedicated to 'Woman's Fortune' just on\r\n     the spot where Caius had yielded to his mother's words; and the\r\n     first priestess of the temple was Valeria, into whose heart Jupiter\r\n     had first put the thought to go to Volumnia, and to call upon her\r\n     to go out to the enemy's camp and entreat her son.\"--_Arnold's\r\n     Hist. of Rome_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n     \"Il y a peu de scènes dans l'histoire plus émouvantes que celle-là,\r\n     et elle ne perd rien à la décoration du théâtre; en se plaçant sur\r\n     un tertre à quatre milles de Rome, près de la voie Latine, dans un\r\n     lieu où il n'y a aujourd'hui que des tombeaux et des ruines, on\r\n     peut se figurer le camp des Volsques, dont les armes et les tentes\r\n     étincellent au soleil.

Rom._ ii. 402.\r\n\r\nThe return drive to Rome may be varied by turning to the right about a\r\nmile beyond this, into a lane which leads past the so-called temple of\r\nBacchus to the Via Appia Vecchia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may now follow the lines of white mulberry-trees across the open\r\nspace in front of St. John Lateran, which is a continuation of the\r\nancient papal promenade of \"the Mirror,\" to Sta. Croce. The sister\r\nbasilicas look at each other, and at Sta. Maria Maggiore, down avenues\r\nof trees. On the left are the walls of Rome, upon which run the arches\r\nof the Aqua Marcia.\r\n\r\n     \"Few Roman churches are set within so impressive a picture as Santa\r\n     Croce, approached on every side through these solitudes of\r\n     vineyards and gardens, quiet roads, and long avenues of trees, that\r\n     occupy such immense extent within the walls of Rome. The scene from\r\n     the Lateran, looking towards this basilica across the level common,\r\n     between lines of trees, with the distance of Campagna and\r\n     mountains, the castellated walls, the arcades of the Claudian\r\n     aqueduct, amid gardens and groves, is more than beautiful, full of\r\n     memory and association. The other approach, by the unfrequented Via\r\n     di Sta. Croce, presents the finest distances, seen through a\r\n     foliage beyond the dusky towers of the Honorian walls, and a wide\r\n     extent of slopes covered with vineyards, amid which stand at\r\n     intervals some of those forlorn cottage farms, grey and\r\n     dilapidated, that form characteristic features in Roman scenery.\r\n     The majestic ruins of Minerva-Medica, the so-called temple of Venus\r\n     and Cupid, the fragments of the Baths of St. Helena, the Castrense\r\n     Amphitheatre, the arches of the aqueduct, half concealed in cypress\r\n     and ivy, are objects which must increase the attractions of a walk\r\n     to this sanctuary of the cross. But the exterior of the church is\r\n     disappointing and inappropriate, retaining nothing antique except\r\n     the square Lombardic tower of the twelfth century, in storeys of\r\n     narrow-arched windows, its brickwork ornamented with disks of\r\n     coloured marble, and a canopy, with columns, near the summit, for a\r\n     statue no longer in its place.\"--_Hemans' Catholic Italy_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nThe site of the _Basilica of Sta. Croce in Gerusalemme_ was once\r\noccupied by the garden of Heliogabalus, and afterwards by the palace of\r\nthe Empress Helena, mother of Constantine, whose residence here was\r\nknown as the Palatium Sessorianum, whence the name of Sessorian,\r\nsometimes given to the basilica.\r\n\r\nThe church was probably once a hall in the palace of Helena, to which an\r\napse was added by Constantine, in whose reign it was consecrated by Pope\r\nSylvester. It was repaired by Gregory II. early in the eighth century;\r\nthe monastery was added by Benedict VII. about 975, and the whole was\r\nrebuilt by Lucius II. in 1144. The church was completely modernized by\r\nBenedict XIV. in the last century, and scarcely anything, except the\r\ntower, now remains externally, which is even as old as the twelfth\r\ncentury. The fine columns of granite and bigio-lumachellato, which now\r\nadorn the façade, were plundered from the neighbouring temple in 1744.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the church is devoid of beauty, owing to modernizations.\r\nFour out of twelve fine granite columns, which divided its nave and\r\naisles, are boxed up in senseless plaster piers. The high altar is\r\nadorned with an urn of green basalt, sculptured with lions' heads, which\r\ncontains the bodies of SS. Anastasius and Cæsarius. Two of the pillars\r\nof the baldacchino are of breccia-corallina. The fine frescoes of the\r\ntribune by _Pinturicchio_ have been much retouched. They were executed\r\nunder Alexander VI., on a commission from Cardinal Carvajal, who is\r\nhimself represented as kneeling before the cross, which is held by the\r\nEmpress Helena.\r\n\r\n     \"The very important frescoes of the choir apsis of Sta. Croce (now\r\n     much over-painted) are of Pinturicchio's better time. They\r\n     represent the finding of the Cross, with a colossal Christ in a\r\n     nimbus among angels above,--a figure full of wild\r\n     grandeur.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     \"Near the entrance of the church is a valuable monument of the\r\n     papal history of the tenth century, in a metrical epitaph to\r\n     Benedict VII., recording his foundation of the adjoining monastery\r\n     for monks, who were to sing day and night the praises of the Deity;\r\n     his charities to the poor; and the deeds of the anti-pope Franco,\r\n     called by Baronius (with play upon his assumed name Boniface)\r\n     Malefacius, who usurped the Holy See, imprisoned and strangled the\r\n     lawful pope, Benedict VI., and pillaged the treasury of St.\r\n     Peter's, but in one month was turned out and excommunicated, when\r\n     he fled to Constantinople. The chronology of this epitaph is by the\r\n     ancient system of Indictions, the death of the pope dated XII.\r\n     Indiction, corresponding to the year 984: and the Latin style of\r\n     the tenth century is curiously exemplified in lines relating to the\r\n     anti-pope:\r\n\r\n    'Hic primus repulit Franconis spurca superbi\r\n    Culmina qui invasit sedis apostolicæ\r\n    Qui dominumque suum captum in castro habebat\r\n    Carceris interea auctis constrictus in uno\r\n    Strangulatus ubi exuerat hominem.'\"\r\n\r\n    _Hemans' Catholic Italy._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consecration of the Golden Rose, formerly sent to foreign princes,\r\nused to take place in this church. The principal observances here now\r\nare connected with the exhibition of the relics, of which the principal\r\nis the Title of the True Cross.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1492, when some repairs were ordered by Cardinal Mendoza, a\r\n     niche was discovered near the summit of the apse, enclosed by a\r\n     brick front, inscribed 'Titulus Crucis.' In it was a leaden coffer,\r\n     containing an imperfect plank of wood, 2 inches thick, 1½ palm\r\n     long, 1 palm broad. On this, in letters more or less perfect, was\r\n     the inscription in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, _Jesus Nazarene King_.\r\n     It was venerated by Innocent VIII., with the college of cardinals,\r\n     and enclosed by Mendoza in the silver shrine, where it is exposed\r\n     three times a year from the balcony. The relics are exposed on the\r\n     4th Sunday in Lent. On Good Friday the rites are more impressive\r\n     here than in any other church, the procession of white-robed monks,\r\n     and the deep toll of the bell announcing the display of the relics\r\n     by the mitred abbot, are very solemn, and it is surprising, that\r\n     while crowds of strangers submit to be crushed in the Sistine,\r\n     scarcely one visits this ancient basilica on that day.\"--_Hemans'\r\n     Catholic Italy._\r\n\r\n     \"The list of relics on the right of the apsis of Sta.

Peter and Paul; of the cotton\r\n     which collected the blood of Christ; of the manna which fed the\r\n     Israelites; of the rod of Aaron, which flourished in the desert; of\r\n     the relics of the eleven prophets!\"--_Percy's Romanism._\r\n\r\nTwo staircases near the tribune lead to the subterranean church, which\r\nhas an altar with a pietà, and statues of SS. Peter and Paul of the\r\ntwelfth century. Hence opens the chapel of Sta. Helena,[285] which women\r\n(by a perversion especially strange in this case) are never allowed to\r\nenter except on the festival of the saint, August 18. It is built upon a\r\nsoil composed of earth brought by the empress from Palestine. Her statue\r\nis over the altar. The vault has mosaics (originally erected under\r\nValentinian III., but restored by _Zucchi_ in 1593) representing, in\r\novals, a half-length figure of the Saviour; the Evangelists and their\r\nsymbols; the Finding of the True Cross; SS. Peter and Paul; St.\r\nSylvester, the conservator of the church; and Sta. Helena, with Cardinal\r\nCarvajal kneeling before her.\r\n\r\nHere the feast of the \"Invention of the True Cross\" (May 3) is\r\ncelebrated with great solemnity, when the hymns \"Pange Lingua\" and\r\n\"Vexilla Regis\" are sung, and the antiphon:--\r\n\r\n     \"O Cross, more glorious than the stars, world famous, beauteous of\r\n     aspect, holiest of things, which alone wast worthy to sustain the\r\n     weight of the world: dear wood, dear nails, dear burden, bearing;\r\n     save those present assembled in thy praise to-day. Alleluia.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the collect:--\r\n\r\n     \"O God, who by the glorious uplifting of the salvation-bearing\r\n     cross, hast displayed the miracles of thy passion, grant that by\r\n     the merit of that life-giving wood, we may attain the suffrages of\r\n     eternal life, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe adjoining _Monastery_ belongs to the Cistercians. Only part of one\r\nwing is ancient. The library formerly contained many curious MSS., but\r\nmost of these were lost to the basilica, when the collection was removed\r\nto the Vatican during the French occupation and the exile of Pius VII.\r\n\r\nThe garden of the monastery contains the ruin generally known as the\r\n_Temple of Venus and Cupid_, but considered by Dr. Braun to be the\r\nSessorian Basilica or law-court, where the causes of slaves (who were\r\nallowed to appeal to no other court) were wont to be heard. Behind the\r\nmonastery is the _Amphitheatrum Castrense_, attributed to the time of\r\nNero, when it is supposed to have been erected for the games of two\r\ncohorts of soldiers, quartered near here. It is ingrafted into the line\r\nof the Honorian walls, and is best seen from the outside of the city.\r\nIts arches and pillars, with Corinthian capitals, are all of brick.\r\n\r\n(On the left of the Via Sta. Croce, which leads hence to Sta. Maria\r\nMaggiore, is the gate of the _Villa Altieri_, chiefly remarkable for its\r\ngrand umbrella pine, the finest in the city. Further, on the right, is a\r\ntomb of unknown origin, now used as a farm-house and a wine-shop.)\r\n\r\nTurning to the right from the basilica, we follow a lane which leads\r\nbeneath some fine brick arches of an aqueduct of the time of Nero, cited\r\nby Ampère,[286] as exemplifying the perfection to which architecture\r\nattained in the reign of this emperor, \"by the quality of the bricks,\r\nand the excellence and small quantity of the cement.\" These ruins are\r\npopularly called the Baths of Sta. Helena.\r\n\r\nPassing these arches we find ourselves facing the _Porta Maggiore_,\r\nformed by two arches of the Claudian Aqueduct, formerly known as the\r\nPorta Labicana, and Porta Prenestina, of which the former was closed in\r\nthe time of Honorius, and has never been re-opened. Three inscriptions\r\nremain, the first relating to the building of the aqueduct by the\r\nEmperor Tiberius Claudius;--the second and third to its restoration by\r\nVespasian and Titus. Above the Aqua Claudia flowed a second stream, the\r\nAnio Novus.\r\n\r\nOutside the gate, only lately disclosed, upon the removal of\r\nconstructions of the time of Honorius (the fragments of those worth\r\npreserving are placed on the opposite wall), is the _Tomb of the Baker\r\nEurysaces_, who was also one of the inspectors of aqueducts. The tomb is\r\nattributed to the early years of the Empire. Its first storey is\r\nsurmounted by the inscription: \"EST HOC MONUMENTUM MARCEI VERGILEI\r\nEVRYSACES PISTORIS REDEMPTORIS APPARET.\" Its second storey is composed\r\nof rows of the mortars used in baking, placed sideways, and supporting\r\na frieze with bas-reliefs telling the story of a baker's work, from the\r\nbringing of the corn into the mill to its distribution as bread. In the\r\nfront of the tomb was formerly a relief of the baker and his wife, with\r\na sarcophagus, and the inscription: \"FUIT ATISTIA UXOR MIHEI--FEMINA\r\nOPTVMA VEIXSIT--QUOIVS CORPORIS RELIQUIÆ--QUOD SUPERANT SUNT IN--HOC\r\nPANARIO.\" This has been foolishly removed, and is now to be seen upon\r\nthe opposite wall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom this gate many pleasant excursions may be taken. The direct road\r\nleads to Palestrina by Zagarolo, and at 1½ mile from the gate passes,\r\non the left, _Torre Pignatarra_, the tomb of Sta. Helena, whence the\r\nmagnificent porphyry sarcophagus, now in the Vatican, was removed. The\r\nname is derived from the _pignatte_, or earthen pots, used in the\r\nbuilding. Beneath it is a catacomb, now closed. The adjoining _Catacomb\r\nof SS. Pietro e Marcellino_ contains some well preserved paintings; the\r\nmost interesting is that of the Divine Lamb on a mound (from which four\r\nrivers flow as in the mosaics of the ancient basilicas), with figures of\r\nPetrus, Gorgonius, Marcellinus, and Tiburtius. At three miles from the\r\ngate the road reaches _Centocellæ_, whence, near the desolate tower\r\ncalled _Torre Pernice_, there is a most picturesque view of the aqueduct\r\n_Aqua Alexandrina_, built by Alexander Severus, with a double line of\r\narches crossing the hollow. At five miles, on the right, is the Borghese\r\nfarm of Torre Nuova, with a fine group of old stone pines.\r\n\r\nThe road which turns left from the gate leads by the _Aqua Bollicante_,\r\nwhere the Arvales sang their hymn, to the picturesque ruins of the\r\n_Torre dei Schiavi_, the palace of the Emperors Gordian (A.D. 238),\r\nadjoining which are the remains of a round temple of Apollo. This is,\r\nperhaps, one of the most striking scenes in the Campagna and--backed by\r\nthe violet mountains above Tivoli--is a favourite subject with artists.\r\n\r\n     \"Les Gordiens, très-grands personnages, furent de très-petits\r\n     empereurs. Ils montrent ce qu'était devenu l'aristocratie romaine\r\n     dégénérée.

Son fils également se fit\r\n     quelque réputation en ce genre, grâce surtout à sa bibliothèque de\r\n     soixante mille volumes; mais il avait d'autres goûts encore que\r\n     celui des livres: on lui donne jusqu'à vingt-deux concubines en\r\n     titre, et de chacune d'elles, il eut trois ou quatre enfants. Il\r\n     menait une vie épicurienne dans ses jardins et sous des ombrages\r\n     délicieux: c'étaient les jardins et les ombrages d'une villa\r\n     magnifique que les Gordiens avaient sur la voie Prénestine, et dont\r\n     Capitolin, au temps duquel elle existait encore, nous a laissé une\r\n     description détaillée.

La villa renfermait\r\n     trois basiliques et les thermes que ceux de Rome surpassaient à\r\n     peine. Telle était l'opulence d'une habitation privée vers le\r\n     milieu du troisième siècle de l'empire.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 328.\r\n\r\nThe road which continues in a straight line from hence passes, on the\r\nleft, the Torre Tre Teste. The eighth mile-stone is of historic\r\ninterest, being described by Livy (v. 49) as the spot where the dictator\r\nCamillus overtook and exterminated the army of Gauls who were retreating\r\nfrom Rome with the spoils of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nAt the ninth mile is the _Ponte di Nono_, a magnificent old bridge with\r\nseven lofty arches of lapis-gabinus. This leads (twelve miles from Rome)\r\nto the dried-up lake and the ruins of Gabii (Castiglione), including\r\nthat of the temple of Juno Gabina.\r\n\r\n                      \"Quique arva Gabinæ\r\n    Junonis, gelidumque Anienem, et roscida rivis\r\n    Hernica saxa colunt.\"\r\n\r\n    _Virgil, Æn._ vii. 682.\r\n\r\nThe road which branches off on the left leads (twelve miles from Rome)\r\nto _Lunghezza_, the fine old castle of the Strozzi family, situated on\r\nthe little river Osa. Hence a beautiful walk through a wood leads to\r\nCastello del Osa, the ruins of the ancient _Collatia_, so celebrated\r\nfrom the tragedy of Lucretia. Two miles beyond the Torre dei Schiavi, on\r\nthe left, is the fine castellated farm of _Cervaletto_, a property of\r\nthe Borghese. A field road of a mile and half, passing in front of this\r\n(practicable for carriages), leads to another fine old castellated farm\r\n(five miles from Rome), close to which are the extraordinary _Grottoes\r\nof Cerbara_,--a succession of romantic caves of great size, in the tufa\r\nrocks, from which the material of the Coliseum was excavated. Here the\r\n\"Festa degli Artisti\" is held in May, which is well worth seeing,--the\r\nartists in costume riding in procession, and holding games, amid these\r\nminiature Petra-like ravines. Beyond Cerbara are remains of a villa of\r\nLucius Verus, and, on the bank of the Anio, the romantically-situated\r\ncastle of _Rustica_.\r\n\r\nFrom the Porta Maggiore we may follow a lane along the inside of the\r\nwall, crossing the railway--whence there is a picturesque view of the\r\ntemple of Minerva Medica--to _The Porta S. Lorenzo_, anciently called\r\nthe Porta Tiburtina (the road to Tivoli passes through it), built in\r\n402, by the Emperors Arcadius and Honorius, on the advice of Stilicho,\r\nas we learn from an inscription over the archway of the Marcian,\r\nTepulan, and Julian Aqueducts, now half buried within the later brick\r\ngateway.\r\n\r\nThe road just beyond the gate is connected with the story of the\r\nfavourite saint of the Roman people.\r\n\r\n     \"When Sta. Francesca Romana had no resource but to beg for the sick\r\n     under her care, she went to the basilica of _S. Lorenzo fuori_\r\n     Mura, where was the station of the day, and seated herself amongst\r\n     the crowd of beggars, who, according to custom, were there\r\n     assembled. From the rising of the sun to the ringing of the\r\n     vesper-bell, she sate there, side by side with the lame, the\r\n     deformed, and the blind. She held out her hand as they did, gladly\r\n     enduring, not the semblance, but the reality, of that deep\r\n     humiliation. When she had received enough wherewith to feed the\r\n     poor at home, she rose, and entering the old basilica, adored the\r\n     Blessed Sacrament, and then walked back the long and weary way,\r\n     blessing God all the while.\"--_Lady G. Fullerton._\r\n\r\nA quarter of a mile beyond the gate we come in sight of the church and\r\nmonastery, but the effect is much spoilt by the hideous modern cemetery,\r\nformed since the following description was written:--\r\n\r\n     \"S. Lorenzo is as perfect a picture of a basilica externally, as S.\r\n     Clemente is internally. Viewing it from a little distance, the\r\n     whole pile--in its grey reverend dignity--the row of stones\r\n     indicating the atrium, with an ancient cross in the centre--the\r\n     portico overshadowing faded frescoes--the shelving roof, the\r\n     body-wall bulging out and lapping over, like an Egyptian\r\n     temple--the detached Lombard steeple--with the magic of sun and\r\n     shadow, and the background of the Campagna, bounded by the blue\r\n     mountains of Tivoli--together with the stillness, the repose,\r\n     interrupted only by the chirp of the grasshopper, and the distant\r\n     intermitted song of the Contadino--it forms altogether such a scene\r\n     as painters love to sketch, and poets to re-people with the shadows\r\n     of past ages; and I open a wider heaven for either fraternity to\r\n     fly their fancies in, when I add that it was there the ill-fated\r\n     Peter de Courtenay was crowned Emperor of the East.\"--_Lord\r\n     Lindsay, Christian Art._\r\n\r\n     \"To St. Laurence was given a crown of glory in heaven, and upon\r\n     earth eternal and universal praise and fame; for there is scarcely\r\n     a city or town in all Christendom which does not contain a church\r\n     or altar dedicated to his honour. The first of these was built by\r\n     Constantine outside the gates of Rome, on the spot where he was\r\n     buried; and another was built on the summit of the hill, where he\r\n     was martyred; besides these, there are at Rome four others; and in\r\n     Spain the Escurial, and at Genoa the Cathedral.\"--_Mrs. Jameson._\r\n\r\nWe have already followed St. Laurence to the various spots in Rome\r\nconnected with his story,--to the green space at the Navicella, where he\r\ndistributed his alms before the house of St. Cyriaca (in whose catacomb\r\nhe was first buried); to the basilica in the Palace of the Cæsars, where\r\nhe was tried and condemned; to S. Lorenzo in Fonte, where he was\r\nimprisoned; to S. Lorenzo Pane e Perna, where he died; to S. Lorenzo in\r\nLucina, where his supposed gridiron is preserved; and now we come to his\r\ngrave, where a grand basilica has arisen around the little oratory,\r\nerected by Constantine, which marked his first burial-place in the\r\nCatacombs.\r\n\r\nThe first basilica erected here was built in the end of the sixth\r\ncentury, by Pope Pelagius II., but this was repeatedly enlarged and\r\nbeautified by succeeding popes, and at length was so much altered in\r\n1216, by Honorius III., that the old basilica became merely the choir or\r\ntribune of a larger and more important church. So many other changes\r\nhave since taken place, that Bunsen remarks upon S. Lorenzo as more\r\ndifficult of explanation than any other of the Roman churches.\r\n\r\nIn front of the basilica stands a bronze statue of St. Laurence, upon a\r\ntall granite pillar.\r\n\r\nThe portico is supported by six Ionic columns, four of them spiral.\r\nAbove these is a mosaic frieze of the thirteenth century. In the centre\r\nis the Spotless Lamb, having, on the right, St. Laurence, Honorius III.,\r\nand another figure; and on the left three heads, two of whom are\r\nsupposed to be the virgin martyr Sta. Cyriaca, and her mother\r\nTryphœna, buried in the adjoining cemetery. Above this is a very\r\nrichly decorated marble frieze, boldly relieved with lions' heads. The\r\ngable of the church is faced with modern mosaics of saints. Within the\r\nportico are four splendid sarcophagi; that on the left of the entrance\r\nis adorned with reliefs representing a vintage, with cupids as the\r\nvine-gatherers, and contains the remains of Pope Damasus II., who died\r\nin 1049, after a reign of only twenty-three days. At the sides of the\r\ndoor are two marble lions. The walls of the portico are covered with a\r\nvery curious series of frescoes, lately repainted. They represent four\r\nconsecutive stories.\r\n\r\nOn the right:--\r\n\r\n     A holy hermit, living a life of solitude and prayer, heard a\r\n     rushing noise, and, looking out of his window, saw a troop of\r\n     demons, who told him that the Emperor Henry II. had just expired,\r\n     and that they were hurrying to lay claim to his soul. The hermit\r\n     trembled, and besought them to let him know as they returned how\r\n     they had succeeded. Some days after, they came back and narrated\r\n     that when the Archangel was weighing the good and evil deeds of the\r\n     emperor in his balance, the weight was falling in their\r\n     favour--when suddenly the roasted St. Laurence appeared, bearing a\r\n     golden chalice, which the emperor, shortly before his death, had\r\n     bestowed upon the Church, and cast it into the scale of good deeds,\r\n     and so turned the balance the other way, but that in revenge they\r\n     had broken off one of the golden handles of the chalice. And when\r\n     the hermit heard these things he rejoiced greatly; and the soul of\r\n     the emperor was saved and he became a canonized saint,--and the\r\n     devils departed blaspheming.\r\n\r\nThe order of the frescoes representing this legend is:--\r\n\r\n    1, 2. Scenes in the life of Henry II.\r\n    3. The Emperor offers the golden chalice.\r\n    4. A banquet scene.\r\n    5. The hermit discourses with the devils.\r\n    6. The death of Henry II.--1024.\r\n    7. The dispute for the soul of the Emperor.\r\n    8. It is saved by St. Laurence.\r\n\r\nThe second series represents the whole story of the acts, trial,\r\nmartyrdom, and burial of St. Laurence; one or two frescoes in this were\r\nentirely effaced, and have been added by the restorer. Of the old series\r\nwere:--\r\n\r\n    1. The investiture of St. Laurence as deacon.\r\n    2. St. Laurence washes the feet of poor Christians.\r\n    3. He heals Sta. Cyriaca.\r\n    4. He distributes alms on the Cœlian.\r\n    5. He meets St. Sixtus led to death, and receives his blessing.\r\n    6. He is led before the prefect.\r\n    7. He restores sight to Lucillus.\r\n    8. He is scourged.\r\n    9. He baptizes St. Hippolytus.\r\n    11. He refuses to give up the treasures of the Church.\r\n    13, 14, 15. His burial by St. Hippolytus.\r\n\r\nThe third series represents the story of St. Stephen, followed by that\r\nof the translation of his relics to this basilica.\r\n\r\n     The relics of St. Stephen were preserved at Constantinople, whither\r\n     they had been transported from Jerusalem by the Empress Eudoxia,\r\n     wife of Theodosius II. Hearing that her daughter Eudoxia, wife of\r\n     Valentinian II., Emperor of the West, was afflicted with a devil,\r\n     she begged her to come to Constantinople that her demon might be\r\n     driven out by the touch of the relics. The younger Eudoxia wished\r\n     to comply,--but the devil refused to leave her, unless St. Stephen\r\n     was brought to Rome. An agreement was therefore made that the\r\n     relics of St. Stephen should be exchanged for those of St.\r\n     Laurence. St. Stephen arrived, and the empress was immediately\r\n     relieved of her devil, but when the persons who had brought the\r\n     relics of St. Stephen from Constantinople were about to take those\r\n     of St. Laurence back with them, they all fell down dead! Pope\r\n     Pelagius prayed for their restoration to life, which was granted\r\n     for a short time, to prove the efficacy of prayer, but they all\r\n     died again ten days after! Thus the Romans knew that it would be\r\n     criminal to fulfil their promise, and part with the relics of St.\r\n     Laurence, and the bodies of the two martyrs were laid in the same\r\n     sarcophagus.\r\n\r\nThe frescoes in the left wall represent a separate story:--\r\n\r\n     A holy sacristan arose before the dawn to enjoy solitary prayers\r\n     before the altars of this church. Once when he was thus employed,\r\n     he found that he was not alone, and beheld three persons, a priest,\r\n     a deacon, and sub-deacon, officiating at the altar, and the church\r\n     around him filled with worshippers, whose faces bore no mortal\r\n     impress. Tremblingly he drew near to him whom he dreaded the least,\r\n     and inquired of the deacon, who this company might be. 'The priest\r\n     whom thou seest is the blessed apostle Peter,' answered the spirit,\r\n     'and I am Laurence who suffered cruel torments for the love of my\r\n     master Christ, upon a Wednesday, which was the day of his betrayal;\r\n     and in remembrance of my martyrdom we are come to-day to celebrate\r\n     here the mysteries of the Church; and the sub-deacon who is with us\r\n     is the first martyr, St. Stephen,--and the worshippers are the\r\n     apostles, the martyrs, and virgins who have passed with me into\r\n     Paradise, and have come back hither to do me honour; and of this\r\n     solemn service thou art chosen as the witness. When it is day,\r\n     therefore, go to the pope and tell what thou hast seen, and bid\r\n     him, in my name, to come hither and to celebrate a solemn mass with\r\n     all his clergy, and to grant indulgences to the faithful.' But the\r\n     sacristan trembled and said, 'If I go to the pope he will not\r\n     believe me: give me some visible sign, then, which will show what I\r\n     have seen.' And St. Laurence ungirt his robe, and giving his girdle\r\n     to the sacristan, bade him show it in proof of what he told. In the\r\n     morning the old man related what he had seen to the abbot of the\r\n     monastery, who bore the girdle to the then pope, Alexander II. The\r\n     pope accompanied him back to the basilica,--and on their way they\r\n     were met by a funeral procession, when, to test the powers of the\r\n     girdle, the pope laid it on the bier, and at once the dead arose\r\n     and walked. Then all men knew that the sacristan had told what was\r\n     true, and the pope celebrated mass as he had been bidden, and\r\n     promised an indulgence of forty years to all who should visit on a\r\n     Wednesday any church dedicated to St. Laurence.\r\n\r\nThis story is told in eight pictures:--\r\n\r\n     1. The sacristan sees the holy ones.\r\n\r\n     2. The Phantom Mass.\r\n\r\n     3. The sacristan tells the abbot.\r\n\r\n     4. The abbot tells the pope.\r\n\r\n     5. The pope consults his cardinals.\r\n\r\n     6. The dead is raised by the girdle.\r\n\r\n     7. Mass is celebrated at St. Lorenzo, and souls are freed from\r\n     purgatory by the intercession of the saint.\r\n\r\n     8. Prayer is made at the shrine of St. Laurence.\r\n\r\nThe nave--which is the basilica of Honorius III.--is divided from its\r\nside aisles by twenty-two Ionic columns of granite and cipollino. The\r\nsixth column on the right has a lizard and a frog amongst the\r\ndecorations of its capital, which led Winckelmann to the supposition\r\nthat these columns were brought hither from the Portico of Octavia,\r\nbecause Pliny describes that the architects of the Portico of Metellus,\r\nwhich formerly occupied that site, were two Spartans, named Sauros and\r\nBatrachus, who implored permission to carve their names upon their work;\r\nand that when leave was refused, they introduced them under this\r\nform,--Batrachus signifying a frog, and Sauros a lizard.\r\n\r\nAbove the architrave are frescoes by _Fracassini_, of the lives and\r\nmartyrdoms of SS. Stephen and Laurence. Higher up are saints connected\r\nwith the history of the basilica. The roof is painted in patterns. The\r\nsplendid opus-alexandrinum pavement is of the tenth century. On the left\r\nof the entrance is a baptismal font, above which are more frescoes\r\nrelating to the story of St. Laurence. On the right, beneath a mediæval\r\ncanopy, is a very fine sarcophagus, sculptured with a wedding\r\nscene,--adapted as the tomb of Cardinal Fieschi, nephew of Innocent IV.,\r\nwho died in 1256. Inside the canopy, is a fresco of Christ throned, to\r\nwhom St. Laurence presents the cardinal, and St. Stephen Innocent IV.\r\nBehind stand St. Eustace and St. Hippolytus. The west end of the church\r\nis closed by the inscription, \"Hi sunt qui venerunt de tribulatione\r\nmagna, et laverunt stolas suas in sanguine agni.\"\r\n\r\nThe splendid ambones in the nave, inlaid with serpentine and porphyry,\r\nare of the twelfth century. That on the right, with a candelabrum for\r\nthe Easter candle, was for the gospel; that on the left for the epistle.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the left aisle, a passage leads down to a subterranean\r\nchapel, used for prayer for the souls in purgatory. Here is the entrance\r\nto the _Catacombs of Sta. Ciriaca_, which are said to extend as far as\r\nSant' Agnese, but which have been much and wantonly injured in the works\r\nfor the new cemetery. Here the body of St. Laurence is related to have\r\nbeen found. Over the entrance is inscribed:--\r\n\r\n     \"Hæc est tumba illa toto orbe terrarum celeberrima ex cimeterio S.\r\n     Cyriacæ Matronæ ubi sacrum si quis fecerit pro defunctis eorum\r\n     animas e purgatorii pœnis divi Laurentii meritis evocabit.\"[287]\r\n\r\nPassing the triumphal arch, we enter the early basilica of Pope Pelagius\r\nII. (572--590), which is on a lower level than that of the nave. Here\r\nare twelve splendid columns of pavonazzetto, of which the two first bear\r\ntrophies carved above the acanthus leaves of their capitals. These\r\nsupport an entablature formed from various antique fragments, put\r\ntogether without uniformity,--and a triforium, divided by twelve small\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nOn the inside, which was formerly the outside, of the triumphal arch, is\r\na restored mosaic of the time of Pelagius, representing the Saviour\r\nseated upon the world, having on the right St. Peter, St. Laurence, and\r\nSt. Pelagius, and on the left St. Paul and St. Stephen, and with them,\r\nin a warrior's dress, St. Hippolytus, the soldier who was appointed to\r\nguard St. Laurence in prison, and who, being converted by him, was\r\ndragged to death by wild horses, after seeing nineteen of his family\r\nsuffer before his eyes. He is the patron saint of horses. Here also are\r\nthe mystic cities, Bethlehem and Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nA long poetical inscription is known to have once existed here; only two\r\nlines remain round the arch:--\r\n\r\n    \"Martyrium flaminis olim Levita subisti\r\n    Jure tuis templis lux veneranda redit.\"\r\n\r\nThe high altar, with a baldacchino, supported by four porphyry columns,\r\ncovers the remains of SS. Laurence and Stephen, enclosed in a silver\r\nshrine by Pelagius II., a pope so munificent that he had given up his\r\nown house as a hospital for aged poor. St. Justin is also buried here.\r\n\r\n     \"No one knew what had become of the body of St. Stephen for 400\r\n     years, when Lucian, a priest of Carsamagala, in Palestine, was\r\n     visited in a dream by Gamaliel, the doctor of the law at whose feet\r\n     Paul was brought up in all the learning of the Jews; and Gamaliel\r\n     revealed to him that after the death of Stephen he had carried away\r\n     the body of the saint, and had buried it in his own sepulchre, and\r\n     had also deposited near it the body of Nicodemus and other saints;\r\n     and this dream having been repeated three times, Lucian went with\r\n     others deputed by the bishop, and dug with mattocks and spades in\r\n     the spot which had been indicated,--a sepulchre in a garden,--and\r\n     found what they supposed to be the remains of St. Stephen, their\r\n     peculiar sanctity being proved by many miracles. These relics were\r\n     first deposited in Jerusalem, in the church of Sion, and afterwards\r\n     by the younger Theodosius carried to Constantinople, whence they\r\n     were taken to Rome, and placed by Pope Pelagius in the same tomb\r\n     with St. Laurence. It is related that when they opened the\r\n     sarcophagus, and lowered into it the body of St. Stephen, St.\r\n     Laurence moved on one side, giving the place of honour on the right\r\n     hand to St. Stephen: hence the common people of Rome have conferred\r\n     on St. Laurence the title of 'Il cortese Spagnuolo'--the courteous\r\n     Spaniard.\"--_Jameson's Sacred and Legendary Art._\r\n\r\nBehind the altar is a mosaic screen, with panels of porphyry and\r\nserpentine, and an ancient episcopal throne.\r\n\r\nThe lower church was filled up with soil till 1864, when restorations\r\nwere ordered here. These were entrusted to Count Vespignani, and have\r\nbeen better carried out than most church alterations in Rome; but an\r\ninteresting portico, with mosaics by one of the famous Cosmati family,\r\nhas been destroyed to make room for some miserable arrangements\r\nconnected with the modern cemetery.\r\n\r\nIt was in this basilica that Peter Courtenay, Count of Auxerre, with\r\nYolande his wife, received the imperial crown of Constantinople from\r\nHonorius III. in 1217.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the church is the very picturesque _Cloister of the\r\nMonastery_, built in 1190, for Cistercian monks, but assigned as a\r\nresidence for any Patriarchs of Jerusalem who might visit Rome. Here are\r\npreserved many ancient inscriptions, and other fragments from the\r\nneighbouring catacombs.\r\n\r\nThe basilica is now almost engulfed in the Cemetery of S. Lorenzo, the\r\ngreat modern burial-ground of Rome. It was opened in 1837, but has been\r\nmuch enlarged in the last ten years. Hither wend the numerous funerals\r\nwhich are seen passing through the streets after Ave-Maria, with a\r\nprocession of monks bearing candles. A frightful gate, with a laudatory\r\ninscription to Pius IX., and a hideous modern chapel, have been erected.\r\nThere are very few fine monuments. The best are those in imitation of\r\nthe cinque-cento tombs of which there are so many in the Roman churches.\r\nThat by Podesti, the painter, to his wife, in the right corridor of the\r\ncloister, is touching. The higher ground to the left, behind the church,\r\nis occupied by the tombs of the rich. Those of the poor are\r\nindiscriminately scattered over a wide plain. A range of cliffs on the\r\nleft were perforated by the catacombs of Sta. Cyriaca, which, with the\r\nbad taste so constantly displayed in Rome, have been wantonly and\r\nshamefully broken up. Those who do not wish to descend into a catacomb,\r\nmay here see (from without) all their arrangements--in the passages\r\nlined with sepulchres, and even some small chapels, lined with rude\r\nfrescoes, laid open to the air, where the cliff has been cut away.\r\n\r\nA Roman funeral is a most sad sight, and strikes one with an unutterable\r\nsense of desolation.\r\n\r\n     \"After a death the body is entirely abandoned to the priests, who\r\n     take possession of it, watch over it, and prepare it for burial;\r\n     while the family, if they can find refuge anywhere else, abandon\r\n     the house and remain away a week.... The body is not ordinarily\r\n     allowed to remain in the house more than twelve hours, except on\r\n     condition that it is sealed up in lead or zinc. At nightfall a sad\r\n     procession of _becchini_ and _frati_ may be seen coming down the\r\n     street, and stopping before the house of the dead. The _becchini_\r\n     are taken from the lowest classes of the people, and hired to carry\r\n     the corpse on the bier and to accompany it to the church and\r\n     cemetery. They are dressed in shabby black _cappe_, covering their\r\n     head and face as well as their body, and having two large holes cut\r\n     in front of the eyes to enable them to see. These _cappe_ are\r\n     girdled round the waist, and the dirty trousers and worn-out shoes\r\n     are miserably manifest under the skirts of their dress--showing\r\n     plainly that their duty is occasional. All the _frati_ and\r\n     _becchini_, except the four who carry the bier, are furnished with\r\n     wax candles, for no one is buried in Rome without a candle. You may\r\n     know the rank of the person to be buried by the lateness of the\r\n     hour and the number of the _frati_. If it be the funeral of a\r\n     person of wealth or a noble, it takes place at a late hour, the\r\n     procession of _frati_ is long, and the bier elegant. If it be a\r\n     state-funeral, as of a prince, carriages accompany it in mourning,\r\n     the coachman and lackeys are bedizened in their richest liveries,\r\n     and the state hammer-cloths are spread on the boxes, with the\r\n     family arms embossed on them in gold. But if it be a pauper's\r\n     funeral, there are only _becchini_ enough to carry the bier to the\r\n     grave, and two _frati_, each with a little candle; and the sunshine\r\n     is yet on the streets when they come to take away the corpse.\r\n\r\n     \"You will see this procession stop before the house where the\r\n     corpse is lying. Some of the _becchini_ go up-stairs, and some keep\r\n     guard below. Scores of shabby men and boys are gathered round the\r\n     _frati_; some attracted simply by curiosity, and some for the\r\n     purpose of catching the wax, which gutters down from the candles as\r\n     they are blown by the wind. The latter may be known by the great\r\n     horns of paper which they carry in their hands. While this crowd\r\n     waits for the corpse, the _frati_ light their candles, and talk,\r\n     laugh, and take snuff together. Finally comes the body, borne down\r\n     by four of the _becchini_. It is in a common rough deal coffin,\r\n     more like an ill-made packing-case than anything else. No care or\r\n     expense has been laid out upon it to make it elegant, for it is\r\n     only to be seen for a moment. Then it is slid upon the bier, and\r\n     over it is drawn the black velvet pall with golden trimmings, on\r\n     which a cross, death's head, and bones are embroidered. Four of the\r\n     _becchini_ hoist it on their shoulders, the _frati_ break forth\r\n     into their hoarse chaunt, and the procession sets out for the\r\n     church. Little and big boys and shabby men follow along, holding up\r\n     their paper horns against the sloping candles to catch the dripping\r\n     wax. Every one takes off his hat, or makes the sign of the cross,\r\n     or mutters a prayer, as the body passes; and with a dull, sad,\r\n     monotonous chaunt, the candles gleaming and flaring, and casting\r\n     around them a yellow flickering glow, the funeral winds along\r\n     through the narrow streets, and under the sombre palaces and\r\n     buildings, where the shadows of night are deepening every moment.\r\n     The spectacle seen from a distance, and especially when looked down\r\n     upon from a window, is very effective; but it loses much of its\r\n     solemnity as you approach it; for the _frati_ are so vulgar, dirty,\r\n     and stupid, and seem so utterly indifferent and heartless, as they\r\n     mechanically croak out their psalms, that all other emotions yield\r\n     to a feeling of disgust.\"--_Story's Roba di Roma._\r\n\r\n     \"Ces rapprochements soudains de l'antiquité et des temps modernes,\r\n     provoqués par la vue d'un monument dont la destinée se lie à l'une\r\n     et aux autres, sont très-fréquents à Rome. L'histoire poétique\r\n     d'Énée aurait pu m'en fournir plusieurs. Ainsi dans l'Énéide, aux\r\n     funérailles de Pallas, une longue procession s'avance, portant des\r\n     flambeaux funèbres, suivant l'usage antique, dit Virgile. En effet,\r\n     on se souvient que l'usage des cierges remontait à l'abolition des\r\n     sacrifices humains, accompli dans les temps héroïques par le dieu\r\n     pélasgique Hercule. La description que fait Virgile des funérailles\r\n     de Pallas pourrait convenir à un de ces enterrements romains où\r\n     l'on voit de longues files de capucins marchant processionnellement\r\n     en portant des cierges.\r\n\r\n    ... 'Lucet via longo\r\n    Ordine flammarum.'\"\r\n\r\n    _Æn._ xi. 143.\r\n\r\n    --_Ampère_, i. 217.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the road from S. Lorenzo is the _Catacomb of St.\r\nHippolytus_, interesting as described by the Christian poet Prudentius,\r\nwho wrote at the end of the fourth century.\r\n\r\n     \"Not far from the city walls, among the well-trimmed orchards,\r\n     there lies a crypt buried in darksome pits. Into its secret\r\n     recesses a steep path in the winding stairs directs one, even\r\n     though the turnings shut out the light. The light of day, indeed,\r\n     comes in through the doorway, as far as the surface of the opening,\r\n     and illuminates the threshold of the portico; and when, as you\r\n     advance further, the darkness as of night seems to get more and\r\n     more obscure throughout the mazes of the cavern, there occur at\r\n     intervals apertures cut in the roof which convey the bright rays of\r\n     the sun upon the cave. Although the recesses, twisting at random\r\n     this way and that, form narrow chambers with darksome galleries,\r\n     yet a considerable quantity of light finds its way through the\r\n     pierced vaulting down into the hollow bowels of the mountain. And\r\n     thus throughout the subterranean crypt it is possible to perceive\r\n     the brightness and enjoy the light of the absent sun. To such\r\n     secret places is the body of Hippolytus conveyed, near to the spot\r\n     where now stands the altar dedicated to God. That same altar-slab\r\n     (mensa) gives the sacrament, and is the faithful guardian of its\r\n     martyrs' bones, which it keeps laid up there in expectation of the\r\n     Eternal Judge, while it feeds the dwellers by the Tiber with holy\r\n     food. Wondrous is the sanctity of the place! The altar is at hand\r\n     for those who pray, and it assists the hopes of men by mercifully\r\n     granting what they need. Here have I, when sick with ills both of\r\n     soul and body, oftentimes prostrated myself in prayer and found\r\n     relief.... Early in the morning men come to salute (Hippolytus):\r\n     all the youth of the place worship here: they come and go until the\r\n     setting of the sun. Love of religion collects together into one\r\n     dense crowd both Latins and foreigners; they imprint their kisses\r\n     on the shining silver; they pour out their sweet balsams; they\r\n     bedew their faces with tears.\"--See _Roma Sotterranea_, p. 98.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIN THE CAMPUS MARTIUS.\r\n\r\n     S.

Upon the word,\r\n    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,\r\n    And bade him follow,--so, indeed, he did:\r\n    The torrent roared; and we did buffet it\r\n    With lusty sinews; throwing it aside,\r\n    And stemming it with hearts of controversy.\"\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare_, _Julius Cæsar_.\r\n\r\nIt was only near the foot of the Capitol that any buildings were erected\r\nunder the republic, and these only public offices; under the empire a\r\nfew magnificent edifices were scattered here and there over the plain.\r\nIn the time of Cicero, the Campus was quite uninhabited; it is supposed\r\nthat the population were first attracted here when the aqueducts were\r\ncut during the Lombard invasion, which drove the inhabitants from the\r\nhills, and obliged them to seek a site where they could avail themselves\r\nof the Tiber.\r\n\r\nThe hills, which were crowded by a dense population in ancient Rome, are\r\nnow for the most part deserted; the plain, which was deserted in\r\nancient Rome, is now thickly covered with inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe plain was bounded on two sides by the Quirinal and Capitoline hills,\r\nwhich were both in the hands of the Sabines, but it had no connection\r\nwith the Latin hill of the Palatine. Thus it was dedicated to the Sabine\r\ngod, Mamers or Mars, either before the time of Servius Tullius, as is\r\nimplied by Dionysius, or after the time of the Tarquins, as stated by\r\nLivy.\r\n\r\nTarquinius Superbus had appropriated the Campus Martius to his own use,\r\nand planted it with corn. After he was expelled, and his crops cut down\r\nand thrown into the Tiber, the land was restored to the people. Here the\r\ntribunes used to hold the assemblies of the plebs in the Prata Flaminia\r\nat the foot of the Capitol, before any buildings were erected as their\r\nmeeting-place.\r\n\r\nThe earliest building in the Campus Martius of which there is any\r\nrecord, is the Temple of Apollo, built by the consul C. Julius, in B.C.\r\n430. Under the censor C. Flaminius, in B.C. 220, a group of important\r\nedifices arose on a site which is ascertained to be nearly that occupied\r\nby the Palazzo Caetani, Palazzo Mattei, and Sta. Caterina dei Funari.\r\nThe most important was the Circus Flaminius, where the plebeian games\r\nwere celebrated under the care of the plebeian ædiles, and which in\r\nlater times was flooded by Augustus, when thirty-six crocodiles were\r\nkilled there for the amusement of the people.[288]\r\n\r\nClose to this Circus was the _Villa Publica_, erected B.C. 438, for\r\ntaking the census, levying troops, and such other public business as\r\ncould not be transacted within the city.\r\n\r\nHere, also, foreign ambassadors were received before their entrance into\r\nthe city, as afterwards at the Villa Papa Giulio, and here victorious\r\ngenerals awaited the decree which allowed them a triumph.[289] It was in\r\nthe Villa Publica that Sylla cruelly massacred three thousand partisans\r\nof Marius, after he had promised them their lives.\r\n\r\n    \"Tunc flos Hesperiæ, Latii jam sola juventus,\r\n    Concidit, et miseræ maculavit ovilia Romæ.\"\r\n\r\n    _Lucan_, ii. 196.\r\n\r\nThe cries of these dying men were heard by the senate who were assembled\r\nat the time in the _Temple of Bellona_ (restored by Appius Claudius\r\nCæcus in the Samnite War), which stood hard by, and in front of which at\r\nthe extremity of the Circus Flaminius, where the Piazza Paganica now is,\r\nstood the _Columna Bellica_, where the Ferialis, when war was declared,\r\nflung a lance into a piece of ground, supposed to represent the enemy's\r\ncountry, when it was not possible to do it at the hostile frontier\r\nitself. Julius Cæsar flung the spear here when war was declared against\r\nCleopatra.[290]\r\n\r\n    \"Prospicit a templo summum brevis area Circum.\r\n      Est ibi non parvæ parva columna notæ.\r\n    Hinc solet hasta manu, belli prænuncia, mitti;\r\n      In regem et gentes, cum placet arma capi.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid_, _Fast._ vi. 205.\r\n\r\nAlmost adjoining the Villa Publica was the Septa, where the Comitia\r\nCenturiata of the plebs assembled for the election of their tribunes.\r\nThe other name of this place of assembly, Ovilia, or the sheepfolds,\r\nbears witness to its primitive construction, when it was surrounded by a\r\nwooden barrier. In later times the Ovilia was more richly adorned;\r\nPliny describes it as containing two groups of sculpture--Pan and the\r\nyoung Olympus, and Chiron and the young Achilles--for which the keepers\r\nwere responsible with their lives;[291] and under the empire it was\r\nenclosed in magnificent buildings.\r\n\r\nIn B.C. 189 the _Temple of Hercules Musagetes_ was built by the censor\r\nFulvius Nobilior. It occupied a site on the north-west of the portico of\r\nOctavia.[292] Sylla restored it:--\r\n\r\n    \"Altera pars Circi custode sub Hercule tuta est;\r\n      Quod Deus Euboico carmine munus habet.\r\n    Muneris est tempus, qui Nonas Lucifer ante est:\r\n      Si titulos quæris; Sulla probavit opus.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid_, _Fast._ vi. 209.\r\n\r\nThis temple was rebuilt by L. Marcius Philippus, stepfather of Augustus,\r\nand surrounded by a portico called after him Porticus Philippi.[293]\r\n\r\n    \"Vites censeo porticum Philippi,\r\n    Si te viderit Hercules, peristi.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, v. _Ep._ 50.[294]\r\n\r\nThe _Portico of Octavia_ itself was originally built by the prætor, Cn.\r\nOctavius, in B.C. 167, and rebuilt by Augustus, who re-dedicated it in\r\nmemory of his sister. Close adjoining was the _Porticus Metelli_, built\r\nB.C. 146, by Cæcilius Metellus.[295] It contained two _Temples of Juno\r\nand Jupiter_.[296] Another _Temple of Juno_ stood between this and the\r\ntheatre of Pompey, having been erected by M. Æmilius Lepidus in B.C.\r\n170, together with a _Temple of Diana_.[297] Near the same spot was a\r\n_Temple of Fortuna Equestris_, erected in consequence of a vow of Q.\r\nFulvius Flaccus when fighting against the Celtiberians in B.C. 176; a\r\n_Temple of Isis and Serapis_; and a _Temple of Mars_, erected by D.\r\nJunius Brutus, for his victories over the Gallicians in B.C. 136;[298]\r\nat this last-named temple the people, assembled in their centuries,\r\nvoted the war against Philip of Macedon. In the same neighbourhood was\r\nthe _Theatre of Balbus_, a general under Julius Cæsar, occupying the\r\nsite of the Piazza della Scuola.\r\n\r\nThe munificence of Pompey extended the public buildings much further\r\ninto the Campus. He built, after his triumph, a _Temple of Minerva_ on\r\nthe site now occupied by the Church of Sta. Maria sopra Minerva, on\r\nwhich the beautiful statue called \"the Giustiniani Minerva\" was found,\r\nand the _Theatre of Pompey_, surrounded by pillared porticoes and walks\r\nshaded with plane-trees.\r\n\r\n    \"Scilicet umbrosis sordet Pompeia columnis\r\n      Porticus aulæis nobilis Attalicis:\r\n    Et creber pariter platanis surgentibus ordo,\r\n      Flumina sopito quæque Marone cadunt.\"\r\n\r\n    _Propertius_, ii. _El._ 32.\r\n\r\n    \"Tu modo Pompeia lentus spatiare sub umbra,\r\n      Cum Sol Herculei terga leonis adit.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid_, _de Art. Am._ i. 67.\r\n\r\n    \"Inde petit centum pendentia tecta columnis,\r\n      Illinc Pompeii dona, nemusque duplex.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, ii. _Ep._ 14.\r\n\r\nUnder the empire important buildings began to rise up further from the\r\ncity. The _Amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus_, whose ruins are supposed\r\nto be the foundation of the Monte-Citorio, was built by a general under\r\nAugustus; the magnificent _Pantheon_, the _Baths of Agrippa_, and the\r\n_Diribitorium_--where the soldiers received their pay--whose huge and\r\nunsupported roof was one of the wonders of the city,[299] were due to\r\nhis son-in-law. Agrippa also brought the _Aqua Virgo_ into the city to\r\nsupply his baths, conveying it on pillars across the Flaminian Way, the\r\nfuture Corso.\r\n\r\n    \"Qua vicina pluit Vipsanis porta columnis,\r\n      Et madet assiduo lubricus imbre lapis,\r\n    In jugulum pueri, qui roscida templa subibat,\r\n      Decidit hiberno prægravis unda gelu.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, iv. _Ep._ 18.\r\n\r\nNear this aqueduct was a temple of Juturna;\r\n\r\n    \"Te quoque lux eadem, Turni soror, æde recepit;\r\n    Hic ubi Virginea campus obitur aqua.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid_, _Fast._ i. 463.\r\n\r\nand another of Isis.\r\n\r\n    \"A Meroë portabit aquas, ut spargat in æde\r\n    Isidis, antiquo quæ proxima surgit ovili.\"\r\n\r\n    _Juvenal_, _Sat._ vi. 528.\r\n\r\nThese were followed by the erection of the _Temple of Neptune_--by some\r\nascribed to Agrippa, who is said to have built it in honour of his naval\r\nvictories, by others to the time of the Antonines; by the great\r\n_Imperial Mausoleum_, then far out in the country; and by the _Baths of\r\nNero_, on the site now occupied by S. Luigi and the neighbouring\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n            \" ... Quid Nerone pejus?\r\n    Quid thermis melius Neronianis?\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial_, vii. _Ep._ 33.\r\n\r\n          \" ... Fas sit componere magnis\r\n    Parva, Neronea nec qui modo totus in unda\r\n    Hic iterum sudare negat.\"\r\n\r\n    _Statius_, _Silv._ i. 5.\r\n\r\nBesides these were an _Arch of Tiberius_, erected by Claudius; a _Temple\r\nof Hadrian_ and _Basilica of Matidia_, built by Antoninus Pius, in\r\nhonour of his predecessors; the _Temple and Arch of Marcus Aurelius_,\r\nnear the site of the present Palazzo Chigi; and an _Arch of Gratian,\r\nValentinian II., and Theodosius_.\r\n\r\nOf all these various buildings nothing remains except the Pantheon, a\r\nsingle arch of the Baths of Agrippa, some disfigured fragments of the\r\nMausoleum, a range of columns belonging to the temple of Neptune, and a\r\nportion of the Portico of Octavia. The interest of the Campus Martius is\r\nalmost entirely mediæval or modern, and the objects worth visiting are\r\nscattered amid such a maze of dirty and intricate streets, that they are\r\nseldom sought out except by those who make a long stay in Rome, and care\r\nfor everything connected with its history and architecture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFollowing the line of streets which leads from the Piazza di Spagna to\r\nSt. Peter's (Via Condotti, Via Fontanella Borghese), beyond the Borghese\r\nPalace, let us turn to the left by the Via della Scrofa,[300] at the\r\nentrance of which is the _Palazzo Galitzin_ on the right, and the\r\n_Palazzo Cardelli_ on the left.\r\n\r\nPassing, on the right, _St. Ivo of Brittany_, the national church of the\r\nBretons, the second turn on the right, Via S. Antonio dei Portoguesi,\r\nshows a church dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, and the fine mediæval\r\ntower called _Torre della Scimia_.\r\n\r\nIn this tower once lived a man who had a favourite ape. One day this\r\ncreature seized upon a baby, and rushing to the summit, was seen from\r\nbelow, by the agonized parents, perched upon the battlements, and\r\nbalancing their child to and fro over the abyss. They made a vow in\r\ntheir terror that if the baby were restored in safety, they would make\r\nprovision that a lamp should burn nightly for ever before an image of\r\nthe Virgin on the summit. The monkey, without relaxing its hold of the\r\ninfant, slid down the wall, and bounding and grimacing, laid the child\r\nat its mother's feet. Thus a lamp always burns upon the battlements\r\nbefore an image of the Madonna.\r\n\r\nThis building is better known, however, as \"Hilda's Tower,\" a fictitious\r\nname which it has received from Hawthorne's mysterious novel.\r\n\r\n     \"Taking her way through some of the intricacies of the city, Miriam\r\n     entered what might be called either a widening of a street or a\r\n     small piazza. The neighbourhood comprised a baker's oven, emitting\r\n     the usual fragrance of sour bread; a shoe shop; a linendraper's\r\n     shop; a pipe and cigar shop; a lottery office; a station for French\r\n     soldiers, with a sentinel pacing in front; and a fruit stand, at\r\n     which a Roman matron was selling the dried kernels of chesnuts,\r\n     wretched little figs, and some bouquets of yesterday. A church, of\r\n     course, was near at hand, the façade of which ascended into lofty\r\n     pinnacles, whereon were perched two or three winged figures of\r\n     stone, either angelic or allegorical, blowing stone trumpets in\r\n     close vicinity to the upper windows of an old and shabby palace.\r\n     This palace was distinguished by a feature not very common in the\r\n     architecture of Roman edifices; that is to say, a mediæval tower,\r\n     square, massive, lofty, and battlemented and machicolated at the\r\n     summit.\r\n\r\n     \"At one of the angles of the battlements stood a shrine of the\r\n     Virgin, such as we see everywhere at the street-corners of Rome,\r\n     but seldom or never, except in this solitary instance, at a height\r\n     above the ordinary level of men's views and aspirations. Connected\r\n     with this old tower and its lofty shrine, there is a legend; and\r\n     for centuries a lamp has been burning before the Virgin's image at\r\n     noon, at midnight, at all hours of the twenty-four, and must be\r\n     kept burning for ever, as long as the tower shall stand; or else\r\n     the tower itself, the palace, and whatever estate belongs to it,\r\n     shall pass from its hereditary possessor, in accordance with an\r\n     ancient vow, and become the property of the Church.\r\n\r\n     \"As Miriam approached, she looked upward, and saw--not, indeed, the\r\n     flame of the never-dying lamp, which was swallowed up in the broad\r\n     sunlight that brightened the shrine--but a flock of white doves,\r\n     shining, fluttering, and wheeling above the topmost height of the\r\n     tower, their silver wings flashing in the pure transparency of the\r\n     air. Several of them sat on the ledge of the upper window, pushing\r\n     one another off by their eager struggle for this favourite station,\r\n     and all tapping their beaks and flapping their wings tumultuously\r\n     against the panes; some had alighted in the street, far below, but\r\n     flew hastily upward, at the sound of the window being thrust ajar,\r\n     and opening in the middle, on rusty hinges, as Roman windows\r\n     do.\"--_Transformation._\r\n\r\nThe next street, on the right, leads to the _Church of S. Agostino_,\r\nbuilt originally by Bacio Pintelli, in 1483, for Cardinal\r\nd'Estouteville, archbishop of Rouen and Legate in France (the vindicator\r\nof Joan of Arc), but altered in 1740 by Vanvitelli. The delicate work of\r\nthe front, built of travertine robbed from the Coliseum, is much admired\r\nby those who do not seek for strength of light and shadow. This\r\nchurch--dedicated to her son--contains the remains of Sta. Monica,\r\nbrought hither from Ostia, where she died. The chapel of St. Augustin,\r\nin the right transept, contains a gloomy picture by _Guercino_ of St.\r\nAugustin between St. John Baptist and St. Paul the Hermit. The high\r\naltar, by Bernini, has an image of the Madonna brought from Sta. Sophia\r\nat Constantinople, and attributed to St. Luke. The second chapel in the\r\nleft aisle has a group of the Virgin and Child with St. Anna, by\r\n_Andrea Sansovino_, 1512.\r\n\r\nOn the third pilaster, to the left of the nave, is a fresco of Isaiah by\r\n_Raphael_, painted in 1512, but retouched by Daniele de Volterra in the\r\nreign of Paul IV. The prophet holds a scroll with words from Isaiah\r\nxxvi. 2. Few will agree with the stricture of Kugler:--\r\n\r\n     \"In a fresco, representing the prophet Isaiah and two angels, who\r\n     hold a tablet, the comparison is unfavourable to Raphael. An effort\r\n     to rival the powerful style of Michael-Angelo is very visible in\r\n     this picture; an effort which, notwithstanding the excellence of\r\n     the execution in parts, has produced only an exaggerated and\r\n     affected figure.\"--_Kugler_, ii. 371.\r\n\r\nThe church overflows with silver hearts and other votive offerings,\r\nwhich are all addressed to the Madonna and Child of _Andrea Sansovino_,\r\nclose to the west entrance, which is really a fine piece of\r\nsculpture--for an object of Roman Catholic idolatry.\r\n\r\n     \"On the pedestal of the image is inscribed--'N. S. Pio VII. concede\r\n     in perpetuo 100 giorni d'indulgenza da lucrarsi una volta al giorno\r\n     da tutte quelle che divotamente toccheranno il piede di questa S.\r\n     Immagine recitando un Ave Maria per il bisogno di S. Chiesa. 7\r\n     Giug. MD.CCCXXII.\"\r\n\r\nAround this statue are, or were a short time ago, a whole array of\r\nassassins' daggers hung up, strange instances of trespass-offering.\r\n\r\n     \"The Church of S. Agostino is the Methodist meeting-house, so to\r\n     speak, of Rome, where the extravagance of the enthusiasm of the\r\n     lower orders is allowed the freest scope. Its Virgin and Child are\r\n     covered, smothered, with jewels, votive offerings of those whose\r\n     prayers the image had heard and answered. All round the image the\r\n     walls are covered with votive offerings likewise; some of a similar\r\n     kind--jewels, watches, valuables of different descriptions. Some\r\n     offerings again consist of pictures, representing, generally in\r\n     the rudest way, some sickness or accident, cured or averted by the\r\n     appearance in the clouds of the Madonna, as seen in the image.\r\n     Almost the whole side of the church is covered, from pavement to\r\n     roof, with these curious productions.\"--_Alford's Letters from\r\n     Abroad._\r\n\r\n     \"It is not long since the report was spread, that one day when a\r\n     poor woman called upon this image of the Madonna for help, it began\r\n     to speak, and replied, 'If I had only something, then I could help\r\n     thee, but I myself am so poor!'\r\n\r\n     \"This story was circulated, and very soon throngs of credulous\r\n     people hastened hither to kiss the foot of the Madonna, and to\r\n     present her with all kinds of gifts. The image of the Virgin, a\r\n     beautiful figure in brown marble, now sits shining with ornaments\r\n     of gold and precious stones. Candles and lamps burn around, and\r\n     people pour in, rich and poor, great and small, to kiss, some of\r\n     them two or three times--the Madonna's foot, a gilt foot, to which\r\n     the forehead also is devotionally pressed. The marble foot is\r\n     already worn away with kissing, the Madonna is now rich.... Below\r\n     the altar it is inscribed in golden letters that Pius VII. promised\r\n     two hundred days' absolution to all such as should kiss the\r\n     Madonna's foot, and pray with the whole heart _Ave\r\n     Maria_.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\nPassing the arch, just beyond this, is the _Church of S. Apollinare_,\r\nbuilt originally by Adrian I. (772--795), but modernized under Benedict\r\nXIV. by Fuga. It contains a number of relics of saints brought from the\r\nEast by Basilian monks. Over the altar, on the left, in the inner\r\nvestibule, is a Madonna by _Perugino_. The church now belongs to the\r\nGerman college.\r\n\r\n     S. Apollinare is said to have accompanied St. Peter from Antioch to\r\n     Rome, and to have remained here as his companion and assistant\r\n     (whence the church dedicated to him here). He was afterwards sent\r\n     to preach the faith in Ravenna, where he became the first Christian\r\n     bishop, and suffered martyrdom outside the Rimini gate, July 23,\r\n     A.D. 79.\r\n\r\nAdjoining this church is the _Seminario Romano_, founded by Pius IV., on\r\na system drawn up by his nephew, S. Carlo Borromeo. Eight hundred young\r\nboys are annually educated here. In order to gain admittance, it is\r\nnecessary to be of Roman birth, to be acquainted with grammar, and to\r\nwish to take orders. Pupils are held to their first intention of\r\nentering the priesthood, by being compelled to refund all the expenses\r\nof their education, if they renounce it.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite the church is the _Palazzo Altemps_, built 1580, by\r\nMartino Lunghi. Its courtyard, due, like all the best palace work in\r\nRome, to Baldassare Peruzzi, is exceedingly graceful and picturesque.\r\nAncient statues and flowering shrubs occupy the spaces between the\r\narches of the ground-floor, and on the first-floor is a loggia, richly\r\ndecorated with delicate arabesques in the style of Giovanni da Udine.\r\nNear this loggia is a chapel of exceedingly beautiful proportions, and\r\ndelicately worked detail. It has several good frescoes, especially the\r\nFlight into Egypt, and Sta. Cecilia singing to the Virgin and the Child.\r\nAt the west end is a small gracefully proportioned music-gallery, in\r\nvarious coloured marbles; in an inner chapel is a fine bronze crucifix.\r\nThe palace, of which the most interesting parts are shown on request, is\r\nnow the property of the Duke of Gallese, to whom it came by the marriage\r\nof Jules Hardouin, Duke of Gallese, with Donna Lucrezia d'Altemps.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Via S. Agostino by the mediæval _Torre Sanguinea_, whose\r\nname bears witness to the mediæval frays of popes and anti-popes, we\r\nreach the German national church of _Sta. Maria dell' Anima_, which\r\nderives its name from a marble group of the Madonna invoked by two souls\r\nin purgatory, found among the foundations, and now inserted in the\r\ntympanum of the portal. It was originally built _c._ 1440, with funds\r\nbequeathed by \"un certo Giovanni Pietro,\" but enlarged in 1514; the\r\nfaçade is by Giuliano da Sangallo. The door-frames, of delicate\r\nworkmanship, are by Antonio Giamberti.\r\n\r\nThe front entrance is generally closed, but one can always gain\r\nadmittance from behind, through the courtyard of the German hospital.\r\n\r\nThe interior is peculiar, from its great height and width in comparison\r\nwith its length. It is divided into three almost equal aisles. Over the\r\nhigh altar is a damaged picture of the Holy Family with saints, by\r\n_Giulio Romano_. On the right is the fine tomb of Pope Adrian VI.,\r\nAdrian Florent (1522--23), designed by Baldassare Peruzzi, and carried\r\nout by Michelangelo Sanese and Niccolo Tribolo. This pope, the son of a\r\nship-builder at Utrecht, was professor at the university of Louvain, and\r\ntutor of Charles V. After the witty, brilliant age of Julius II. and Leo\r\nX., he ushered in a period of penitence and devotion. He drove from the\r\npapal court the throng of artists and philosophers who had hitherto\r\nsurrounded it, and he put a stop to the various great buildings which\r\nwere in progress, saying, \"I do not wish to adorn priests with churches,\r\nbut churches with priests.\" Still he found the times so much too\r\nfrivolous for him, that he only survived a year. In his epitaph we\r\nread:--\r\n\r\n     \"Hadrianus hic situs est, qui nihil sibi infelicius in vita quam\r\n     quod imperaret, duxit.\"[301]\r\n\r\nand--\r\n\r\n    \"Proh dolor! quantum refert in quæ tempora vel optimi.\r\n    .... Cujusque virtus incidat!\"\r\n\r\nThe tomb was erected at the expense of Cardinal William of Enkenfort,\r\nthe only prelate to whom he had time to give a hat.\r\n\r\n     \"It is an irony, that Adrian, who despised all the arts on\r\n     principle, and looked upon Greek statues as idolatrous, had a more\r\n     artistic monument than Leo X. of the house of Medici. Baldassare\r\n     Peruzzi made the design, its sculptures were carried out by\r\n     Michelangelo Sanese and Tribolo, and they merit the highest\r\n     acknowledgment. Here, as is so often the case, the architecture is,\r\n     as it were, a frontispiece; but the way in which the pope is\r\n     represented, resembles, in conformity with his character, the type\r\n     of the middle ages. He is stretched upon a simple marble\r\n     sarcophagus, and slumbers with his head supported by his hand. His\r\n     countenance (Adrian was very handsome) is deeply marked and\r\n     sorrowful. In the lunette above, following the ancient type,\r\n     appears Mary with the Child between St. Peter and St. Paul. Below,\r\n     in the niches, stand the figures of the four cardinal virtues:\r\n     Temperance holds a chain; Courage a branch of a tree, while a lion\r\n     stands by her side; Justice has an ostrich by her side; Wisdom\r\n     carries a mirror and a serpent. These figures are executed with\r\n     great care. Lastly, under the sarcophagus is a large bas-relief\r\n     representing the entry of the pope to Rome. He sits on horseback in\r\n     the dress of a cardinal; behind him follow cardinals and monks; the\r\n     senator of Rome renders homage on his knees, while from the gate\r\n     the eternal Rome comes forth to meet him. This Cypria, so well\r\n     adorned by his predecessors, seems ill-pleased to do homage to this\r\n     cross old man. With secret pleasure one sees a pagan idea carried\r\n     out in the corner: the Tiber is represented as a river god with his\r\n     horn of abundance; and thus the devout pope could not defend\r\n     himself against the heathen spirit of the time, which has at least\r\n     attached itself to his tomb.\"--_Gregorovius, Grabmäler der Päpste._\r\n\r\nOpposite the pope, on the left of the choir, is the fine tomb of a Duke\r\nof Cleves, who died 1575, by Egidius of Riviere and Nicolaus of Arras.\r\n\r\nThe body of the church has several good pictures. In the 1st chapel of\r\nthe right aisle is St. Bruno receiving the keys of the cathedral of\r\nMiessen in Saxony from a fisherman, who had found them in the inside of\r\na fish, by _Carlo Saraceni_; in the 2nd chapel, the monument of\r\nCardinal Slusius; in the 3rd chapel, an indifferent copy of the Pietà of\r\nMichael Angelo, by _Nanni di Bacio Bigio_. In the 1st chapel of the left\r\naisle is the martyrdom of St. Lambert, _C. Saraceni_.\r\n\r\n     The two pictures in this church are cited by Lanzi as the best\r\n     works of this comparatively rare artist, sometimes called Carlo\r\n     Veneziano, 1585--1625. He sought to follow in the steps of\r\n     Caravaggio; many will think that he surpassed him, when they look\r\n     upon the richness of colour and grand effect of light and shadow\r\n     which is displayed here.\r\n\r\nIn the 3rd chapel (del Christo Morto), frescoes from the life of Sta.\r\nBarbara, _Mich. Coxcie_, altar-piece (the entombment) and frescoes by\r\n_Salviati_.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the west door is the tomb of Cardinal Andrea of Austria,\r\nnephew of Ferdinand II., who died 1650; on the right that of Cardinal\r\nEnckenovirt, died 1500. In the passage towards the sacristy is a fine\r\nbas-relief, representing Gregory XIII. giving a sword to the Duke of\r\nCleves.\r\n\r\nClose to this church is that of _Sta. Maria della Pace_, built in 1487,\r\nby Baccio Pintelli, to fulfil a curious _ex-voto_ made by Sixtus IV.\r\nFormerly there stood here a little chapel dedicated to St. Andrew, in\r\nwhose portico was an image of the Virgin. One day a drunken soldier\r\npierced the bosom of this Madonna with his sword, when blood\r\nmiraculously spirted forth. Sixtus IV. (Francesco della Rovere,\r\n1471--84) visited the spot with his cardinals, and vowed to compensate\r\nthe Virgin by building her a church, if she would grant peace to Europe\r\nand the Church, then afflicted by a cruel war with the Turks. Peace was\r\nrestored, and the Church of \"St. Mary of Peace\" was erected by the\r\ngrateful pope. Pietro da Cortona added the peculiar semicircular\r\nportico under Alexander VII. The interior has only a short nave ending\r\nunder an octagonal cupola.\r\n\r\nAbove the 1st chapel on the right (that of the Chigi family) are the\r\n_Four Sibyls of Raphael_.\r\n\r\n     \"This is one of Raphael's most perfect works: great mastery is\r\n     shown in the mode of filling and taking advantage of the apparently\r\n     unfavourable space. The angels who hold the tablets to be written\r\n     on, or read by the Sibyls, create a spirited variety in the severe\r\n     symmetrical arrangement of the whole. Grace in the attitudes and\r\n     movements, with a peculiar harmony of form and colour, pervade the\r\n     whole picture; but important restorations have unfortunately become\r\n     necessary in several parts. An interesting comparison may be\r\n     instituted between this work and the Sibyls of Michael Angelo. In\r\n     each we find the peculiar excellence of the great masters; for\r\n     while Michael Angelo's figures are grand, sublime, profound, the\r\n     fresco of the Pace bears the impress of Raphael's severe and\r\n     ingenious grace. The four Prophets, on the wall over the Sibyls,\r\n     were executed by Timoteo della Vite, after drawings by\r\n     Raphael.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     \"The Sibyls have suffered much from time, and more, it is said,\r\n     from restoration; yet the forms of Raphael, in all their\r\n     loveliness, all their sweetness, are still before us; they breathe\r\n     all the soul, the sentiment, the chaste expression, and purity of\r\n     design that characterize his works. The dictating angels hover over\r\n     the heads of the gifted maids, one of whom writes with rapid pen\r\n     the irreversible decrees of Fate. The countenances and musing\r\n     attitudes of her sister Sibyls express those feelings of habitual\r\n     thoughtfulness and pensive sadness natural to those who are cursed\r\n     with the knowledge of futurity, and all its coming\r\n     evils.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"The Sibyls are simply beautiful women of antique form, to whom,\r\n     with the aid of books, scrolls, and inscriptions, the Sibyllic idea\r\n     has been given, but who would equally pass for the abstract\r\n     personifications of virtues or cities. They are four in\r\n     number,--the Cumana, Phrygia, Persica, and Tiburtina; all, with the\r\n     exception of the last, in the fulness of youth and beauty, and\r\n     occupied, apparently, with no higher aim than that of displaying\r\n     both. Indeed, the Tiburtina matches ill with the rest, either in\r\n     character or action. She is aged, has an open book on her lap, but\r\n     turns with a strange and rigid action as if suddenly called. The\r\n     very comparison with her tends to divest the others of the\r\n     Sibylline character. In this, the angels who float above, and\r\n     obviously inspire them, also help, for while adding to the charm of\r\n     the composition, which is one of the most exquisite as to mere\r\n     art, they interfere with that inwardly inspired expression which\r\n     all other art has given to these women.\r\n\r\n     \"The inscription on the scroll of the Cumæan Sibyl gives in Greek\r\n     the words, 'The Resurrection of the Dead.' The Persica is writing\r\n     on the scroll held by the angel, 'He will have the lot of Death.'\r\n     The beautiful Phrygia is presented with a scroll, 'The heavens\r\n     surround the sphere of the earth;' and the Tiburtina has under her\r\n     the inscription, 'I will open and arise.' The fourth angel floats\r\n     above, holding the seventh line of Virgil's Eclogue, 'Jam nova\r\n     progenies.'\"--_Lady Eastlake's 'History of Our Lord.'_\r\n\r\nThe 1st chapel on the left has monuments of the Ponzetti family. The 2nd\r\nchapel on the left has an altar-piece of the Virgin between St. Bridget\r\nand St. Catherine, by _Baldassare Peruzzi_; in the front of the picture\r\nkneels the donor, Cardinal Ponzetti. The 1st altar on the right has the\r\nAdoration of the Shepherds by _Sermoneta_. The 2nd chapel, the\r\nburial-place of the Santa Croce family, has rich carved work of the\r\nsixteenth century. The high altar, designed by Carlo Maderno, has an\r\nancient (miracle-working) Madonna. Of the four paintings of the cupola,\r\nthe Nativity of the Virgin is by _Francesco Vanni_; the Visitation,\r\n_Carlo Maratta_; the Presentation in the Temple, _Baldassare Peruzzi_;\r\nthe Death of the Virgin, _Morandi_.\r\n\r\nNewly-married couples have the touching custom of attending their first\r\nmass here, and invoking \"St. Mary of Peace\" to rule the course of their\r\nnew life.\r\n\r\nThe _Cloister of the Convent_, entered on the left under the dome, was\r\ndesigned by _Bramante_ for Cardinal Caraffa in 1504.\r\n\r\nFrom the portico of the church the Via in Parione leads to the _Via del\r\nGoverno Vecchio_. Here, on the right, is the _Palazzo del Governo\r\nVecchio_, with a richly-sculptured door-*way, and ancient cloistered\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nProceeding as far as the Piazza del Orologio, we see on the right an\r\neminence known as _Monte Giordano_, supposed to be artificial, and to\r\nhave arisen from the ruins of ancient buildings.\r\n\r\n     Its name is derived from Giordano Orsini, a noble of one of the\r\n     oldest Roman families, who built the palace there, which is now\r\n     known as the _Palazzo Gabrielli_, and which has rather a handsome\r\n     fountain. It was probably in consequence of the name Jordan, that\r\n     this hillock was chosen in mediæval times as the place where the\r\n     Jews in Rome received the newly-elected pope on his way to the\r\n     Lateran, and where their elders, covered with veils, presented him,\r\n     on their knees, with a copy of the Pentateuch bound in gold. Then\r\n     the Jews spoke in Hebrew, saying, \"Most holy Father, we Hebrew men\r\n     beseech your Holiness, in the name of our synagogue, to vouchsafe\r\n     to us that the Mosaic Law, given on Mount Sinai by the Almighty God\r\n     to Moses our priest, may be confirmed and approved, as also other\r\n     eminent popes, the predecessors of your Holiness, have approved and\r\n     confirmed it\". And the pope replied, \"We confirm the Law, but we\r\n     condemn your faith and interpretation thereof, because He who you\r\n     say is to come, the Lord Jesus Christ, is come already, as our\r\n     Church teaches and preaches.\"\r\n\r\nTurning to the left, we enter a piazza, one side of which is occupied by\r\nthe convent of the Oratorians, and the vast _Church of Santa Maria in\r\nValicella, or the Chiesa Nuova_, built by Martino Lunghi for Gregory\r\nXIII. and S. Filippo Neri. The façade is by Rughesi. The decorations of\r\nthe magnificently-ugly interior are partly due to Pietro da Cortona, who\r\npainted the roof and cupola.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the tribune is the gorgeous _Chapel of S. Filippo Neri_,\r\ncontaining the shrine of the saint, rich in lapis-lazuli and gold,\r\nsurmounted by a mosaic copy of the picture by _Guido_ in the adjoining\r\nconvent.\r\n\r\nOn the right, in the 1st chapel, is the Crucifixion, by _Scipione\r\nGaetani_; in the 3rd chapel, the Ascension, _Maziano_. On the left, in\r\nthe 2nd chapel, is the Adoration of the Magi, _Cesare Nebbia_; in the\r\n3rd chapel, the Nativity, _Durante Alberti_; in the 4th chapel, the\r\nVisitation, _Baroccio_. In the left transept are statues of SS. Peter\r\nand Paul, by _Valsoldo_, and the Presentation in the Temple, by\r\n_Baroccio_. When S. Filippo Neri saw this picture, he said to the\r\npainter \"Ma come avete ben fatto!--Che vera somiglianza!--E così che mi\r\nha apparato tante volte la Santa Vergine.\"\r\n\r\nThe high altar has four columns of porta-santa. Its pictures are by\r\n_Rubens_ in his youth;--that in the centre represents the Virgin in a\r\nglory of angels; on the right are St. Gregory, S. Mauro, and St. Papias;\r\non the left St. Domitilla, St. Nereus, and St. Achilleus.\r\n\r\n_The Sacristy_, entered from the left transept, is by Marucelli. It has\r\na grand statue of S. Filippo Neri, by _Algardi_. The ceiling is painted\r\nby _Pietro da Cortona_--the subject is an angel bearing the instruments\r\nof the passion to heaven.\r\n\r\nThe _Monastery_, built by Borromini, contains the magnificent library\r\nfounded by S. Filippo. The cell of the saint is accessible, even to\r\nladies. It retains his confessional, chair, shoes, rope-girdle,--and\r\nalso a cast taken from his face after death, and some pictures which\r\nbelonged to him, including one of Sta. Francesca Romana, and the\r\nportrait of an archbishop of Florence. In the private chapel adjoining,\r\nis the altar at which he daily said mass, over which is a picture of his\r\ntime. Here also are the crucifix which was in his hands when he died,\r\nhis candlesticks, and some sacred pictures on tablets which he carried\r\nto the sick. The door of the cell is the same, and the little bell by\r\nwhich he summoned his attendant. In a room below is the carved coffin in\r\nwhich he lay in state, a picture of him lying dead, and the portrait by\r\n_Guercino_ from which the mosaic in the church is taken. A curious\r\npicture in this chamber represents an earthquake at Beneventum, in which\r\nPope Gregory XIV. believed that his life was saved by an image of S.\r\nFilippo. When S. Filippo Nero died,--as in the case of S. Antonio,--the\r\nCatholic world exclaimed intuitively, \"Il Santo è morto!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Let the world flaunt her glories! each glittering prize,\r\n    Though tempting to others, is naught in my eyes.\r\n    A child of St. Philip, my master and guide,\r\n    I would live as he lived, and would die as he died.\r\n\r\n    \"If scanty my fare, yet how was he fed?\r\n    On olives and herbs and a small roll of bread.\r\n    Are my joints and bones sore with aches and with pains?\r\n    Philip scourged his young flesh with fine iron chains.\r\n\r\n    \"A closet his home, where he, year after year,\r\n    Bore heat or cold greater than heat or cold here;\r\n    A rope stretch'd across it, and o'er it he spread\r\n    His small stock of clothes; and the floor was his bed.\r\n\r\n    \"One lodging besides; God's temple he chose,\r\n    And he slept in its porch his few hours of repose;\r\n    Or studied by light which the altar-lamp gave,\r\n    Or knelt at the martyr's victorious grave.\"\r\n\r\n    _J. H. Newman_, 1857.\r\n\r\nThe church of the Chiesa Nuova belongs exclusively to the Oratorian\r\nFathers. Pope Leo XII. wished to turn it into a parish church.\r\n\r\n     \"It was said that the superior of the house took, and showed, to\r\n     the Holy Father, an autograph memorial of the founder St. Philip\r\n     Neri to the pope of his day, petitioning that his church should\r\n     never be a parish. And below it was written that pope's promise,\r\n     also in his own hand, that it never should. This pope was St. Pius\r\n     V. Leo bowed to such authorities, said that he could not contend\r\n     against two saints, and altered his plans.\"--_Wiseman's Life of Leo\r\n     XII._\r\n\r\n     \"S. Filippo Neri was good-humoured, witty, strict in essentials,\r\n     indulgent in trifles. He never commanded; he advised, or perhaps\r\n     requested: he did not discourse, he conversed: and he possessed, in\r\n     a remarkable degree, the acuteness necessary to distinguish the\r\n     peculiar merit of every character.\"--_Ranke._\r\n\r\n     \"S. Filippo Neri laid the foundation of the Congregation of\r\n     Oratorians in 1551. Several priests and young ecclesiastics\r\n     associating themselves with him, began to assist him in his\r\n     conferences, and in reading prayers and meditations to the people\r\n     in the Church of the Holy Trinity. They were called Oratorians,\r\n     because at certain hours every morning and afternoon, by ringing a\r\n     bell, they called the people to the church to prayers and\r\n     meditations. In 1564, when the saint had formed his congregation\r\n     into a regular community, he preferred several of his young\r\n     ecclesiastics to holy orders; one of whom was the eminent Cæsar\r\n     Baronius, whom, for his sanctity, Benedict XIV., by a decree dated\r\n     on the 12th of January, 1745, honoured with the title of 'Venerable\r\n     Servant of God.' At the same time he formed his disciples into a\r\n     community, using one common purse and table, and he gave them rules\r\n     and statutes. He forbade any of them to bind themselves to this\r\n     state by vow or oath, that all might live together joined only by\r\n     the bands of fervour and holy charity; labouring with all their\r\n     strength to establish the kingdom of Christ in themselves by the\r\n     most perfect sanctification of their own souls, and to propagate\r\n     the same in the souls of others, by preaching, instructing the\r\n     ignorant, and teaching the Christian doctrine.\"--_Alban Butler._\r\n\r\n     \"S. Filippo Neri exacted from his scholars and associates various\r\n     undignified outward acts. He required from a young Roman prince,\r\n     who wished to enjoy the distinction of being a member of his Order,\r\n     that he should walk through Rome with a fox's tail fastened on\r\n     behind: and when the prince declined to submit to this, he was\r\n     declined admission to the Order. Another was made to go through the\r\n     city without a coat; and another, with torn and tattered sleeves. A\r\n     nobleman took compassion on the last, and offered him a new pair of\r\n     sleeves: the youth declined, but afterwards, by command of the\r\n     master, was obliged gratefully to fetch and wear them. During the\r\n     building of the new church, he compelled his disciples to bring up\r\n     the materials like day labourers, and to lay their hands to the\r\n     work.\"--_Goethe, Romische Briefe._\r\n\r\nIt was in the piazza in front of this church that (during the reign of\r\nClement XIV.) a beautiful boy was wont to improvise wonderful verses to\r\nthe admiration of the crowds who surrounded him. This boy was named\r\nTrapassi, and was the son of a grocer in the neighbourhood. The\r\nArcadian Academy changed his name into Greek, and called him\r\n\"Metastasio.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of the piazza in front of the Chiesa Nuova, the Via\r\nCalabraga leads into the Via Monserrato, which it enters between Sta.\r\nLucia del Gonfalone on the right, and S. Stefano in Piscinula on the\r\nleft;--then, passing on the right S. Giacomo in Aino--behind which, and\r\nthe Palazzo Ricci, is Santo Spirito dei Napolitani, a much frequented\r\nand popular little church--we reach _Sta. Maria di Monserrato_, built by\r\nSangallo, in 1495, where St. Ignatius Loyola was wont to preach and\r\ncatechise.\r\n\r\nHere, behind the altar, under a stone unmarked by any epitaph, repose at\r\nlast the remains of Pope Alexander VI., Rodrigo Borgia\r\n(1492--1503),--the infamous father of the beautiful and wicked Cæsar and\r\nLucretia Borgia, who is believed to have died from accidentally drinking\r\nin a vineyard-banquet the poison which he had prepared for one of his\r\nown cardinals. When exhumed and turned out of the pontifical vaults of\r\nSt Peter's by Julius II., he found a refuge here in his national church.\r\nThe bones of his uncle Calixtus III., Alfonso Borgia (1455--58), rest in\r\nthe same grave.\r\n\r\nA little further, on the left, is the _Church of S. Tommaso degli\r\nInglesi_, rebuilt 1870, on the site of a church founded by Offa, king of\r\nthe East Saxons in 775, but destroyed by fire in 817. It was rebuilt,\r\nand was dedicated by Alexander III. (1159) to St. Thomas à Becket, who\r\nhad lodged in the adjoining hospital when he was in Rome. Gregory XIII.,\r\nin 1575, united the hospital which existed here with one for English\r\nsailors on the Ripa Grande, dedicated to St. Edmund the Martyr, and\r\nconverted them into a college for English missionaries.\r\n\r\n     \"Nothing like a hospice for English pilgrims existed till the first\r\n     great Jubilee, when John Shepherd and his wife Alice, seeing this\r\n     want, settled in Rome, and devoted their substance to the support\r\n     of poor palmers from their own country. This small beginning grew\r\n     into sufficient importance for it to become a royal charity; the\r\n     King of England became its patron, and named its rector, often a\r\n     person of high consideration. Among the fragments of old monuments\r\n     scattered about the house by the revolution, and now collected and\r\n     arranged in a corridor of the college, is a shield surmounted by a\r\n     crown, and carved with the ancient arms of England, lions or\r\n     lionceaux, and fleur-de-lis, quarterly. This used formerly to be\r\n     outside the house, and under it was inscribed:\r\n\r\n        'Hæc conjuncta duo,\r\n          Successus debita legi,\r\n        Anglia dant, regi\r\n          Francia signa suo.\r\n    Laurentius Chance me fecit M.CCC.XII.'\"\r\n\r\n    _Cardinal Wiseman._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hall of the college are preserved portraits of Roman Catholics\r\nwho suffered for their faith in England under Henry VIII. and Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe small cloister has a beautiful tomb of Christopher Bainbrigg,\r\narchbishop of York, British envoy to Julius II., who died at Rome 1514,\r\nand a monument of Sir Thomas Dereham, ob. 1739. Against the wall is the\r\nmonument of Martha Swinburne, a prodigy of nine years old, inscribed:\r\n\r\n     \"Memoriæ Marthæ, Henrici et Marthæ Swinburne. Nat. Angliæ. ex.\r\n     Antiqua. et.

Her years were few, but her life was long and full. She\r\n     spoke English, French, and Italian, and had made some progress in\r\n     the Latin tongue; knew the English and Roman histories, arithmetic,\r\n     and geography; sang the most difficult music at sight with one of\r\n     the finest voices in the world, was a great proficient on the\r\n     harpsichord, wrote well, and danced many sorts of dances with\r\n     strength and elegance. Her face was beautiful and majestic, her\r\n     body a perfect model, and all her motions graceful. Her docility in\r\n     doing everything to make her parents happy, could only be equalled\r\n     by her sense and aptitude. With so many perfections, amidst the\r\n     praises of all persons, from the sovereign down to the beggar in\r\n     the street, her heart was incapable of vanity; affectation and\r\n     arrogance were unknown to her. Her beauty and accomplishments made\r\n     her the admiration of all beholders, the love of all that enjoyed\r\n     her company. Think, then, what the pangs of her wretched parents\r\n     must be on so cruel a separation. Their only comfort is in the\r\n     certitude of her being completely happy beyond the reach of pain,\r\n     and for ever freed from the miseries of this life. She can never\r\n     feel the torments they endure for the loss of a beloved child.\r\n     Blame them not for indulging an innocent pride in transmitting her\r\n     memory to posterity as an honour to her family and to her native\r\n     country England. Let this plain character, penned by her\r\n     disconsolate father, draw a tear of pity from every eye that\r\n     peruses it.\"\r\n\r\nThe arm of St. Thomas à Becket is the chief \"relic\" preserved here.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the street are two exceedingly ugly little churches--very\r\ninteresting from their associations. On the right is _St. Girolamo della\r\nCarità_, founded on the site of the house of Sta. Paula, where she\r\nreceived St Jerome upon his being called to Rome from the Thebaid by\r\nPope Damasus in 392. Here he remained for three years, till, embittered\r\nby the scandal excited by his residence in the house of the widow, he\r\nreturned to his solitude.\r\n\r\nIn 1519 S. Filippo Neri founded here a _Confraternity_ for the\r\ndistribution of dowries to poor girls, for the assistance of debtors,\r\nand for the maintenance of fourteen priests for the visitation and\r\nconfession of the sick.\r\n\r\n     \"Lorsque St. Philippe de Neri fut prêtre, il alla se loger à\r\n     Saint-Jerôme _della Carità_, où il demeura trente-cinq ans, dans la\r\n     société des pieux ecclésiastiques qui administraient les\r\n     sacrements dans cette paroisse. Chaque soir, Philippe ouvrait, dans\r\n     sa chambre qui existe encore, des conférences sur tous les points\r\n     du dogme catholique; les jeunes gens affluaient à ces saintes\r\n     réunions: on y voyait Baronius; Bordini, qui fut archevêque;\r\n     Salviati, frère du cardinal; Tarugia, neveu du pape Jules III. Un\r\n     désir ardent d'exercer ensemble le ministère de la prédication et\r\n     les devoirs de la charité porta ces pieux jeunes gens à vivre en\r\n     commun, sous la discipline du vertueux prêtre, dont le parole était\r\n     si puissante sur leurs cœurs.\"--_Gournerie._\r\n\r\nThe masterpiece of Domenichino, the Last Communion of St. Jerome, in\r\nwhich Sta. Paula is introduced kissing the hand of the dying saint, hung\r\nin this church till carried off to Paris by the French.\r\n\r\nOpposite this is the _Church of Sta. Brigitta_, on the site of the\r\ndwelling of the saint, a daughter of the house of Brahé, and wife of\r\nWalfon, duke of Nericia, who came hither in her widowhood, to pass her\r\ndeclining years near the Tomb of the Apostles. With her, lived her\r\ndaughter St. Catherine of Sweden, who was so excessively beautiful, and\r\nmet with so many importunities in that wild time (1350), that she made a\r\nvow never to leave her own roof except to visit the churches. The\r\ncrucifix, prayer-book, and black mantle of St. Bridget are preserved\r\nhere.[302]\r\n\r\n     \"St. Bridget exercised a reformatory influence as well upon the\r\n     higher class of the priesthood in Rome as in Naples. For she did\r\n     not alone satisfy herself with praying at the graves of the\r\n     martyrs, she earnestly exhorted bishops and cardinals, nay, even\r\n     the pope himself, to a life of the true worship of God and of good\r\n     works, from which they had almost universally fallen, to devote\r\n     themselves to worldly ambition. She awoke the consciences of many,\r\n     as well by her prayers and remonstrances, as by her example. For\r\n     she herself, of a rich and noble race, that of a Brahé, one of the\r\n     nobles in Sweden, yet lived here in Rome, and laboured like a truly\r\n     humble servant of Christ. 'We must walk barefoot over pride, if we\r\n     would overcome it,' said she, and Brigitta Brahé did so; and, in so\r\n     doing, overcame those proud hearts, and won them to\r\n     God.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\nWe now reach the _Palazzo Farnese_,--the most magnificent of all the\r\nRoman palaces,--begun by Paul III., Alessandro Farnese (1534--50), and\r\nfinished by his nephew, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Its architects were\r\nAntonio di Sangallo, Michael Angelo, and Giacomo della Porta, who\r\nfinished the façade towards the Tiber. The materials were plundered\r\npartly from the Coliseum and partly from the theatre of Marcellus; the\r\ngranite basons of the fountains in front are from the baths of\r\nCaracalla. The immense size of the blocks of travertine used in the\r\nbuilding give it a solid grandeur.\r\n\r\nThis palace was inherited by the Bourbon kings of Naples by descent from\r\nElizabetta Farnese, who was the last of her line, and it has for the\r\nlast few years been the residence of the Neapolitan Court, who have\r\nlived here in the utmost seclusion since their exile. For this reason\r\nthe palace is now very seldom shown. Its vast halls are painted with the\r\nmasterpieces of Annibale Caracci--huge mythological subjects,--and a few\r\nfrescoes by Guido, Domenichino, Daniele da Volterra, Taddeo Zucchero,\r\nand others; but there has not been much to see since the dispersion of\r\nthe Farnese gallery of sculpture, of which the best pieces (the Bull,\r\nHercules, Flora, &c.) are in the museum at Naples. In the courtyard is\r\nthe sarcophagus which is said once to have held the remains of Cecilia\r\nMetella.\r\n\r\n     \"The painting the gallery at the Farnese Palace is supposed to have\r\n     partly caused the death of Caracci. Without fixing any price he set\r\n     about it, and employed both himself and all his best pupils nearly\r\n     seven years in perfecting the work, never doubting that the Farnese\r\n     family, who had employed him, would settle a pension upon him, or\r\n     keep him in their service. When his work was finished they paid him\r\n     as you would pay a house-painter, and this ill-usage so deeply\r\n     affected him, that he took to drinking, and never painted anything\r\n     great afterwards.\"--_Miss Berry's Journals._\r\n\r\nBehind the Palazzo Farnese runs the _Via Giulia_, which contains the\r\nugly fountain of the Mascherone. Close to the arch which leads to the\r\nFarnese gardens is the church of _Sta. Maria della Morte_, or _Dell'\r\nOrazione_, built by Fuga. It is in the hands of a pious confraternity\r\nwho devote themselves to the burial of the dead.\r\n\r\n     \"L'église de la _Bonne-Mort_ a son caveau, décoré dans le style\r\n     funèbre comme le couvent des Capucins. On y conserve aussi\r\n     élégamment que possible les os des noyés, asphyxiés et autres\r\n     victimes des accidents. La confrérie de la _Bonne-Mort_ va chercher\r\n     les cadavres; un sacristain assez adroit les dessèche et les\r\n     dispose en ornements. J'ai causé quelque temps avec cet artiste:\r\n     'Monsieur,' me disait-il, 'je ne suis heureux qu'ici, au milieu de\r\n     mon œuvre. Ce n'est pas pour les quelques écus que je gagne tous\r\n     les jours en montrant la chapelle aux étrangers; non; mais ce\r\n     monument que j'entretiens, que j'embellie, que j'égaye par mon\r\n     talent, est devenu l'orgueil et la joie de ma vie.' Il me montra\r\n     ses matériaux, c'est-à-dire quelques poignées d'ossements jetés en\r\n     tas dans un coin, fit l'éloge de la pouzzolane, et témoigna de son\r\n     mépris pour la chaux. 'La chaux brûle les os,' me dit-il, 'elle les\r\n     fait tomber en poussière. On ne peut faire rien de bon avec les os\r\n     qui ont été dans la chaux. C'est de la drogue\r\n     (_robbaccia_).'\"--_About._\r\n\r\nBeyond the arch is the _Palazzo Falconieri_ (with falcons at the\r\ncorners), built by Borromini about 1650. There is something rather\r\nhandsome in its tall three-arched loggia, as seen from the back of the\r\ncourtyard, which overhangs the Tiber opposite the Farnesina. Cardinal\r\nFesch (uncle of Napoleon I.) lived here, and here formed his fine\r\ngallery of pictures.\r\n\r\n     \"The whole of Cardinal Fesch's collection was dispersed at his\r\n     death, having been vainly offered by him, during the last years of\r\n     his life, for sale to the English government, for an annuity of\r\n     4000_l._ per annum.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nFurther on are the _Carceri Nuove_, prisons established by Innocent X.\r\n(appropriately reached by the Via del Malpasso), and then the _Palazzo\r\nSacchetti_, built by Antonio da Sangallo for his own residence, and\r\nadorned by him with the arms of his patron, Paul III., and the grateful\r\ninscription, \"Tu mihi quodcumque hoc rerum est.\" The collection of\r\nstatues which was formed here by Cardinal Ricci, was removed to the\r\nCapitol by Benedict XIV., and became the foundation of the present\r\nCapitoline collection.\r\n\r\nIn front of the Palazzo Farnese, beyond its own piazza, is that known as\r\nthe _Campo di Fiore_, a centre of commerce among the working classes.\r\nHere the most terrible of the Autos da Fé were held by the Dominicans,\r\nin which many Jews and other heretics were burnt alive.\r\n\r\n     One of the most remarkable sufferers here was Giordano Bruno, who\r\n     was born at Nola, A.D. 1550. His chief heresy was ardent advocacy\r\n     of the Copernican system,--the author of which had died ten years\r\n     before his birth. He was also strongly opposed to the philosophy of\r\n     Aristotle, and gave great offence by setting forth views of his\r\n     own, which strongly tended to pantheism. He visited Paris, England,\r\n     and Germany, and everywhere excited hostility by the uncompromising\r\n     expression of his opinions. It was at Venice that he first came\r\n     into the power of his ecclesiastical enemies. After six years of\r\n     imprisonment in that city, he was brought to Rome to be put to\r\n     death. His execution took place in the Campo di Fiore on the 17th\r\n     of February, 1600, in the presence of an immense concourse. It was\r\n     noted that when the monks offered him the crucifix as he was led to\r\n     the stake, he turned away and refused to kiss it. This put the\r\n     finishing touch to his career, in the estimation of all beholders.\r\n     Scioppus, the Latinist, who was present at the execution, with a\r\n     sarcastic allusion to one of Bruno's heresies, the infinity of\r\n     worlds, wrote, \"The flames carried him to those worlds which he had\r\n     imagined.\"[303]\r\n\r\nOn the left of this piazza is the gigantic _Palace of the Cancelleria_,\r\nbegun by Cardinal Mezzarota, and finished in 1494 by Cardinal Riario,\r\nfrom designs of Bramante. The huge blocks of travertine of which it is\r\nbuilt were taken from the Coliseum. The colonnades have forty-four\r\ngranite pillars, said to have belonged to the theatre of Pompey. The\r\nroses with which their (added) capitals are adorned are in reference to\r\nthe arms of Cardinal Riario, nephew of Sixtus IV.\r\n\r\nThis palace was the seat of the Tribunal of the Cancelleria Apostolica.\r\nIn June, 1848, the Roman Parliament, summoned by Pius IX., was held\r\nhere. In July, while the deputies were seated here, the mob burst into\r\nthe council-chamber, and demanded the instant declaration of war against\r\nAustria. On the 16th of November, its staircase was the scene of the\r\nmurder of Count Rossi.\r\n\r\n     \"C'était le 16 Novembre, 1848, le ministre de Pie IX., voué dès\r\n     longtemps à la mort, dont la presse séditieuse disait: 'Si la\r\n     victime condamnée parvient à s'échapper, elle sera poursuivie sans\r\n     relâche, en tout lieu, le coupable sera frappé par une main\r\n     invisible, se fût-il réfugié sur le sein de sa mère ou dans le\r\n     tabernacle du Christ.'\r\n\r\n     \"Dans la nuit du 14 au 15 Novembre, de jeunes étudiants, réunis\r\n     dans cette pensée, s'exercent sans frémir sur un cadavre apporté à\r\n     prix d'or au théâtre Capranica, et quand leurs mains infâmes furent\r\n     devenues assez sûres pour le crime, quand ils sont certains\r\n     d'atteindre au premier coup la veine jugulaire, chacun se rend à\r\n     son poste--'Gardez-vous d'aller au Palais Législatif, la mort vous\r\n     y attend,' fait dire au ministre une Française alors à Rome, Madame\r\n     la Comtesse de Menon: 'Ne sortez pas, ou vous serez assassiné!' lui\r\n     écrit de son côté la Duchesse de Rignano. Mais l'intrépide Rossi,\r\n     n'écoutant que sa conscience, arrive au Quirinal. A son tour le\r\n     pape le conjure d'être prudent, de ne point s'exposer, afin, lui\r\n     dit-il, 'd'éviter à nos ennemis un grand crime, et à moi une\r\n     immense douleur.'--'Ils sont trop lâches, ils n'oseront pas.' Pie\r\n     IX. le bénit et il continue de se diriger vers la chancellerie....\r\n\r\n     \" ... Sa voiture s'arrête, il descend au milieu d'hommes sinistres,\r\n     leur lance un regard de dédain, et continuant sans crainte ni\r\n     peur, il commence à mouter; la foule le presse en sifflant, l'un le\r\n     frappe sur l'épaule gauche, d'un mouvement instinctif, il retourne\r\n     la tête, découvrant la veine fatale, il tombe, se relève, monte\r\n     quelques marches, et retombe inondé de sang.\"--_M. de Bellevue._\r\n\r\nEntered from the courtyard of the palace is the _Church of SS. Lorenzo e\r\nDamaso_, removed by Cardinal Riario in 1495, from another site, where it\r\nhad been founded in 560 by the sainted pope Damasus. It consists of a\r\nshort nave and aisles, and is almost square, with an apse and chapels.\r\nThe doors are by Vignola. At the end of the left aisle is a curious\r\nblack virgin, much revered. Opening from the right aisle is the chapel\r\nof the Massimi, with several tombs; a good modern monument of Princess\r\nGabrielli, &c. Against the last pilaster is a seated statue of S.\r\nHippolytus, Bishop of Porto, taken from that at the Lateran. His relics\r\nare preserved here, with those of S. Giovanni Calabita, and many other\r\nsaints. The tomb of Count Rossi is also here, inscribed \"Optimam mihi\r\ncausam tuendam assumpsi, miserebitur Deus.\" The story of his death is\r\ntold in the words: \"Impiorum consilio meditata cæde occubuit.\" He was\r\nembalmed and buried on the very night of his murder, for fear of further\r\noutrage. St Francis Xavier used to preach in this church in the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nStanding a little back from the street, in the Via de' Baullari, is a\r\npretty little palace, carefully finished in all its details, and\r\nattributed to Baldassare Peruzzi. It is sometimes called _Palazzetto\r\nFarnese_, sometimes _Palazzo Linote_, and is now almost in a state of\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nTurning to the left, in front of the Palazzo Farnese, we reach the\r\nPiazza Capo di Ferro, one side of which is occupied by the _Palazzo\r\nSpada alla Regola_, built in 1564, by Cardinal Capodifero, but\r\nafterwards altered and adorned by Borromini. The courtyard is very rich\r\nin sculptured ornament The palace is always visible, but has a rude and\r\nextortionate porter.\r\n\r\nIn a picturesque and dimly-lighted hall on the first-floor, partially\r\nhung with faded tapestries, is the famous statue believed to be that of\r\nPompey, at the foot of which Julius Cæsar fell. Suetonius narrates that\r\nit was removed by Augustus from the Curia, and placed upon a marble\r\nJanus in front of the basilica. Exactly on that spot was the existing\r\nstatue found, lying under the partition-wall of two houses, whose\r\nproprietors intended to evade disputes by dividing it, when Cardinal\r\nCapodifero interfered, and in return received it as a gift from Pope\r\nJulius III., who bought it for 500 gold crowns.\r\n\r\n    \"And them, dread statue! yet existent in\r\n    The austerest form of naked majesty,--\r\n    Thou who beheldest 'mid the assassins' din,\r\n    At thy bathed base the bloody Cæsar lie,\r\n    Folding his robe in dying dignity,\r\n    An offering to thine altar from the queen\r\n    Of gods and men, great Nemesis! did he die,\r\n    And thou, too, perish, Pompey? have ye been\r\n    Victors of countless kings, or puppets of a scene?\"\r\n\r\n    _Byron, Childe Harold._\r\n\r\n     \"I saw in the Palazzo Spada, the statue of Pompey: the statue at\r\n     whose base Cæsar fell. A stem, tremendous figure! I imagined one of\r\n     greater finish: of the last refinement: full of delicate touches:\r\n     losing its distinctness in the giddy eyes of one whose blood was\r\n     ebbing before it, and settling into some such rigid majesty as\r\n     this, as Death came creeping over the upturned face.\"--_Dickens._\r\n\r\n     \"Cæsar was persuaded at first by the entreaties of his wife\r\n     Calpurnia, who had received secret warning of the plot, to send an\r\n     excuse to the senate; but afterwards, being ridiculed by Brutus for\r\n     not going, was carried thither in a litter.... At the moment when\r\n     Cæsar descended from his litter at the door of the hall, Popilius\r\n     Læna approached him, and was observed to enter into earnest\r\n     conversation with him. The conspirators regarded one another, and\r\n     mutually revealed their despair with a glance. Cassius and others\r\n     were grasping their daggers beneath their robes; the last resource\r\n     was to despatch themselves. But Brutus, observing that the manner\r\n     of Popilius was that of one supplicating rather than warning,\r\n     restored his companions' confidence with a smile. Caesar entered;\r\n     his enemies closed in a dense mass around him, and while they led\r\n     him to his chair kept off all intruders. Trebonius was specially\r\n     charged to detain Antonius in conversation at the door. Scarcely\r\n     was the victim seated, when Tillius Cimber approached with a\r\n     petition for his brother's pardon. The others, as was concerted,\r\n     joined in the supplication, grasping his hands, and embracing his\r\n     neck. Cæsar at first put them gently aside, but, as they became\r\n     more importunate, repelled them with main force. Tillius seized his\r\n     toga with both hands, and pulled it violently over his arms. Then\r\n     P. Casca, who was behind, drew a weapon, and grazed his shoulder\r\n     with an ill-directed stroke. Cæsar disengaged one hand, and\r\n     snatched at the hilt, shouting, 'Cursed Casca, what means\r\n     this?'--'Help,' cried Casca to his brother Lucius, and at the same\r\n     moment the others aimed each his dagger at the devoted object.\r\n     Cæsar for an instant defended himself, and even wounded one of his\r\n     assailants with his stylus; but when he distinguished Brutus in the\r\n     press, and saw the steel flashing in his hand also, 'What, thou\r\n     too, Brutus!' he exclaimed, let go his hold of Casca, and drawing\r\n     his robe over his face, made no further resistance. The assassins\r\n     stabbed him through and through, for they had pledged themselves,\r\n     one and all, to bathe their daggers in his blood. Brutus himself\r\n     received a wound in their eagerness and trepidation. The victim\r\n     reeled a few paces, propped by the blows he received on every side,\r\n     till he fell dead at the foot of Pompeius' statue.\"--_Merivale_,\r\n     ch. xxi.\r\n\r\nThe collection of pictures in this palace is little worth seeing. Among\r\nits other sculptures are eight grand reliefs, which, till 1620, were\r\nturned upside down, and used as a pavement in Sant' Agnese fuori Mura;\r\nand a fine statue of Aristotle.\r\n\r\n     \"Aristote est à Rome, vous pouvons l'aller voir au palais Spada,\r\n     tel que le peignent ses biographes et des vers de Christodore sur\r\n     une statue qui était à Constantinople, les jambes grêles, les joues\r\n     maigres, le bras hors du manteau, _exserto brachio_, comme dit\r\n     Sidoine Apollinaire d'une autre statue qui était à Rome. Le\r\n     philosophe est ici sans barbe aussi bien que sur plusieurs pierres\r\n     gravées; on attribuait à Aristote l'habitude de se raser, rare\r\n     parmi les philosophes et convenable à un sage qui vivait à la cour.\r\n     Du reste, c'est bien là _le maître de ceux qui savent_, selon\r\n     l'expression de Dante, corps usé par l'étude, tête petite mais qui\r\n     enferme et comprend tout.\"--_Ampère_, _Hist. Rom._ iii. 547.\r\n\r\nA little further, on the right, is the _Church of the Trinità dei\r\nPellegrini_, built in 1614; the façade designed by Francesco de'\r\nSanctis. It contains a picture of the Trinity by _Guido_.\r\n\r\nThe hospital attached to this church was founded by S. Filippo Neri for\r\nreceiving and nourishing pilgrims of pious intention, who had come from\r\nmore than sixty miles' distance, for a space of from three to seven\r\ndays. It is divided into two parts, for males and females. Here, during\r\nthe Holy Week, the feet of the pilgrims are publicly washed, those of\r\nthe men by princes, cardinals, &c., those of the women by queens,\r\nprincesses, and other ladies of rank. In this case the washing is a\r\nreality, the feet not having been \"prepared beforehand,\" as for the\r\nLavanda at St Peter's.\r\n\r\nAn authentic portrait of S. Filippo Neri is preserved here, said to have\r\nbeen painted surreptitiously by an artist who happened to be one of the\r\ninmates of the hospital. When S. Filippo saw it, he said, \"You should\r\nnot have stolen me unawares.\"\r\n\r\nThe building in front of this church is the _Monte di Pietà_, founded by\r\nthe Padre Calvo, in the fifteenth century, to preserve the people from\r\nsuffering under the usury of the Jews. It is a government establishment,\r\nwhere money is lent at the rate of five per cent. to every class of\r\nperson. Poor people, especially \"Donne di facenda,\" who have no work in\r\nthe summer, thankfully avail themselves of this and pawn their\r\nnecklaces and earrings, which they are able to redeem when the means of\r\nsubsistence come back with the return of the forestieri. Many Roman\r\nservants go through this process annually, and though the Monte di Pietà\r\nis often a scene of great suffering when unredeemed goods are sold for\r\nthe benefit of the establishment, it probably in the main serves to\r\navert much evil from the poorer classes.\r\n\r\nA short distance further, following the Via dei Specchi, surrounded by\r\nmiserable houses (in one of which is a beautiful double gothic window,\r\ndivided by a twisted column), is the small _Church of Sta. Maria in\r\nMonticelli_, which has a fine low campanile of 1110. Admission may\r\nalways be obtained through the sacristy to visit the famous\r\n\"miracle-working\" picture called \"Gesù Nazareno,\" a modern half-length\r\nof Our Saviour, with the eyelids drooping and half-closed. By an\r\nillusion of the painting, the eyes, if watched steadily, appear to open\r\nand then slowly to close again as if falling asleep,--in the same way\r\nthat many English family portraits appear to follow the living\r\nbystanders with their eyes; but the effect is very curious. In the case\r\nof this picture, the pope turned Protestant, and disapproving of the\r\nattention it excited, caused its secret removal. Remonstrance was made,\r\nthat the picture had been a \"regalo\" to the church, and ought not to be\r\ntaken away, and when it was believed to be sufficiently forgotten, it\r\nwas sent back by night. The mosaics in the apse of this obscure church\r\nare for the most part quite modern, but enclose a very grand and\r\nexpressive head of the Saviour of the World, which dates from 1099, when\r\nit was ordered by Pope Paschal II.\r\n\r\nA little to the left of this church is the _Palazzo Santa Croce_. This\r\npalace will bring to mind the murder of the Marchesa Costanza Santa\r\nCroce, by her two sons (because she would not name them her heirs), on\r\nthe day when the fate of Beatrice Cenci was trembling in the balance,\r\nwhich brought about her condemnation--the then pope, Clement VIII.,\r\ndetermining to make her terrible punishment \"an example to all\r\nparricides.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Santa Croce claims to be a direct descendant of Valerius\r\nPublicola, the \"friend of the people,\" who is commemorated in the name\r\nof a neighbouring church, \"Sancta Maria de Publicolis.\"\r\n\r\nThis is one of the few haunted houses in Rome: it is said that by night\r\ntwo statues of Santa Croce cardinals descend from their pedestals, and\r\nrattle their marble trains about its long galleries.\r\n\r\nHence a narrow street leads to the _Church of S. Carlo a Catinari_,\r\nbuilt in the seventeenth century, from designs of Rosati and Soria. It\r\nis in the form of a Greek cross. The very lofty cupola is adorned with\r\nfrescoes of the cardinal virtues by _Domenichino_, and a fresco of S.\r\nCarlo, by _Guido_, once on the façade of the church, is now preserved in\r\nthe choir. Over the high altar is a large picture by _Pietro da\r\nCortona_, of S. Carlo in a procession during the plague at Milan. In the\r\nfirst chapel on the right, is the Annunciation, by _Lanfranco_; in the\r\nsecond chapel, on the left, the Death of St. Anna, by _Andrea Sacchi_.\r\nOn the pilaster of the last chapel on the right is a good modern tomb,\r\nwith delicate detail. The cord which S. Carlo Borromeo wore round his\r\nneck in the penitential procession during the plague at Milan, is\r\npreserved as a relic here. The Catinari, from whom this church is named,\r\nwere makers of wooden dishes, who had stalls in the adjoining piazza,\r\nor sold their wares on its steps. The street opening from hence (Via de\r\nGiubbonari) contains on its right the Palazzo Pio; at the back of which\r\nare the principal remains of _The Theatre of Pompey_, which was once of\r\ngreat magnificence. In the portico (of a hundred columns) attached to\r\nthis theatre, Brutus sate as prætor, on the morning of the murder of\r\nJulius Cæsar, and close by was the Curia, or senate-house, where:\r\n\r\n    ----\"In his mantle muffling up his face,\r\n    Even at the base of Pompey's statue,\r\n    Which all the while ran blood, great Cæsar fell.\"[304]\r\n\r\nBehind the remains of the theatre, perhaps on the very site of the\r\nCuria, rises the fine modern _Church of S. Andrea della Valle_,[305]\r\nbegun in 1591, by Olivieri, and finished by Carlo Maderno. The façade is\r\nby Carlo Rainaldi. The cupola is covered with frescoes by _Lanfranco_,\r\nthose of the four Evangelists at the angles being by _Domenichino_, who\r\nalso painted the flagellation and glorification of St. Andrew in the\r\ntribune. Beneath the latter are frescoes of events in the life of St.\r\nAndrew by _Calabrese_.\r\n\r\n     \"In the fresco of the Flagellation, the apostle is bound by his\r\n     hands and feet to four short posts set firmly in the ground; one of\r\n     the executioners, in tightening a cord, breaks it, and falls back;\r\n     three men prepare to scourge him with thongs: in the foreground we\r\n     have the usual group of the mother and her frightened children.\r\n     This is a composition full of dramatic life and movement, but\r\n     unpleasing.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 229.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapel on the left is the tomb of Giovanni della Casa,\r\narchbishop of Beneventum, 1556.\r\n\r\nThe last piers of the nave are occupied by the tombs of Pius II., Eneas\r\nSylvius Piccolomini (1458--64), and Pius III., Todeschini (1503),\r\nremoved from the old basilica of St. Peter's. The tombs are hideous\r\nerections in four stages, by Niccolo della Guardia and Pietro da Todi.\r\nThe epitaph of the famous Eneas Sylvius is as good as a biography.\r\n\r\n     \"Pius II., sovereign pontiff, a Tuscan by nation, by birth a native\r\n     of Siena, of the family of the Piccolomini, reigned for six years.\r\n     His pontificate was short, but his glory was great. He reunited a\r\n     Christian Council (Basle) in the interests of the faith. He\r\n     resisted the enemies of the holy Roman see, both in Italy and\r\n     abroad. He placed Catherine of Siena amongst the saints of Christ.\r\n     He abolished the Pragmatic Sanction in France. He re-established\r\n     Ferdinand of Arragon in the kingdom of Sicily. He increased the\r\n     power of the Church. He established the alum mines which were\r\n     discovered near Talpha. Zealous for religion and justice, he was\r\n     also remarkable for his eloquence. As he was setting out for the\r\n     war which he had declared against the Turks, he died at Ancona.\r\n     There he had already his fleet prepared, and the doge of Venice,\r\n     with his senate, as companions in arms for Christ. Brought to Rome\r\n     by a decree of the fathers, he was laid in this spot, where he had\r\n     ordered the head of St. Andrew, which had been brought him from the\r\n     Peloponnese, to be placed. He lived fifty-eight years, nine months,\r\n     and twenty-seven days. Francis, cardinal of Siena, raised this to\r\n     the memory of his revered uncle. MCDLXIV.\"\r\n\r\nPius III., who was the son of a sister of Eneas Sylvius, only reigned\r\nfor twenty-six days. His tomb was the last to be placed in the old St.\r\nPeter's, which was pulled down by his successor.\r\n\r\nTo the right, from S. Andrea della Valle runs the Via della Valle, on\r\nthe right of which is the _Palazzo Vidoni_ (formerly called Caffarelli,\r\nand Stoppani), the lower portion of which was designed by Raphael, in\r\n1513, the upper floor being a later addition. There are a few\r\nantiquities preserved here, among them the \"Calendarium Prænestinum\" of\r\nVerrius Flaccus, being five months of a Roman calendar found by Cardinal\r\nStoppani at Palestrina. At the foot of the stairs is a statue of Marcus\r\nAurelius. At one corner of the palace on the exterior is the mutilated\r\nstatue familiarly known as the _Abbate Luigi_, which was made to carry\r\non witty conversation with the Madama Lucrezia near S. Marco, as Pasquin\r\ndid with Marforio.\r\n\r\nTo the left from St. Andrea della Valle runs the _Via S. Pantaleone_, on\r\nthe right of which, cleverly fitting into an angle of the street, is the\r\ngloomy but handsome _Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne_, built _c._ 1526 by\r\nBaldassare Peruzzi. The semi-*circular portico has six Doric columns.\r\nThe staircase and fountain are peculiar and picturesque. In the loggia\r\nis a fine antique lion.\r\n\r\nThe palace is not often shown, but is a good specimen of one of the\r\nsmaller Roman princely houses. In the drawing-*room, well placed, is the\r\nfamous _Statue of the Discobolus_, a copy of the bronze statue of Myron,\r\nfound in 1761, upon the Esquiline, near the ruined nymphæum known as the\r\nTrophies of Marius. This is more beautiful and better preserved than the\r\nDiscobolus of the Vatican, of which the head is modern.\r\n\r\n     \"Le tête du discobole Massimi se retourne vers le bras qui lance le\r\n     disque, απεστραμμἱνον εἱς τἡν δισκοφὁρον. Cette tête est admirable, ce\r\n     qui est encore une resemblance avec Myron, qui excellait dans les\r\n     têtes comme Polyclète dans les poitrines et Praxitèle dans les\r\n     bras.\"--_Ampère_, iii. 271.\r\n\r\nThe entrance-hall has its distinctive dais and canopy adorned with the\r\nmotto of the family \"Cunctando Restituit,\" in allusion to the descent\r\nwhich they claim from the great dictator Fabius Maximus, who is\r\ndescribed by Ennius as having \"saved the republic by delaying.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Napoléon interpella un Massimo avec cette brusquerie qui\r\n     intimidait tant de gens: 'Est il vrai,' lui dit-il, 'que vous\r\n     descendiez de Fabius-Maximus?'\r\n\r\n     \"'--Je ne saurais le prouver,' répondit le noble romain, 'mais\r\n     c'est un bruit qui court depuis plus de mille ans dans notre\r\n     famille.'\"--_About._\r\n\r\nOn the second floor is a chapel in memory of the temporary resuscitation\r\nto life by S. Filippo Neri of Paul Massimo, a youth of fourteen, who had\r\ndied of a fever, March 16th, 1584.\r\n\r\n     \"S. Filippo Neri was the spiritual director of the Massimo family;\r\n     it is in his honour that the Palazzo Massimo is dressed up in\r\n     festal guise every 16th of March. The annals of the family narrate,\r\n     that the son and heir of Prince Fabrizio Massimo died of a fever at\r\n     the age of fourteen, and that St. Philip, coming into the room amid\r\n     the lamentations of the father, mother, and sisters, laid his hand\r\n     upon the brow of the youth, and called him by his name, on which he\r\n     revived, opened his eyes, and sate up--'Art thou unwilling to die?'\r\n     asked the saint. 'No,' sighed the youth. 'Art thou resigned to\r\n     yield thy soul to God?' 'I am.' 'Then go,' said Philip. 'Va, che\r\n     sii benedetto, e prega Dio per noi.'--The boy sank back on his\r\n     pillow with a heavenly smile on his face and expired.\"--_Jameson's\r\n     Monastic Orders._\r\n\r\nThe back of the palace towards the Piazza Navona is covered with curious\r\nfrescoes in distemper by _Daniele di Volterra._\r\n\r\nIn buildings belonging to this palace, Pannartz and Schweinheim\r\nestablished the first printing-office in Rome in 1455. The rare editions\r\nof this time bear in addition to the name of the printers, the\r\ninscription, \"In ædibus Petri de Maximis.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Conrad Sweynheim et Arnold Pannartz s'établirent près de Subiaco,\r\n     au monastère de Sainte-Scholastique, qui était occupé par les\r\n     Bénédictins de leur nation, et publièrent successivement, avec le\r\n     concours des moines, les _Œuvres de Lactance_, la _Cité de Dieu_\r\n     de saint Augustin, et le traité _de Oratore_ de Cicéron. En 1467,\r\n     ils se transportèrent à Rome, au palais Massimi, où ils\r\n     s'associèrent Jean André de Bussi, évêque d'Aleria, qui avait\r\n     étudié sous Victorin de Feltre, et dont la science leur fut d'une\r\n     haute utilité pour la correction de leurs textes. Le savant évêque\r\n     leur donnait son temps, ses veilles:--'Malheureux métier,'\r\n     disait-il, 'qui consiste non pas à chercher des perles dans le\r\n     fumier, mais du fumier parmi les perles!'--Et cependant il s'y\r\n     adonnait avec passion, sans même y trouver l'aisance. Les livres,\r\n     en effet, se vendirent d'abord si mal que Jean-André de Bussi\r\n     n'avait pas toujours de quoi se faire faire la barbe. Les premiers\r\n     livres qu'il publia chez Conrad et Arnold furent la _Grammaire de\r\n     Donatus_, à trois cents exemplaires, et les _Épitres familières de\r\n     Cicéron_, à cinq cent cinquante.\"--_Gournerie_, _Rome Chrétienne_,\r\n     ii. 79, 1.\r\n\r\nFurther, on the right, is the modernized _Church of S. Pantaleone_,\r\nbuilt originally in 1216 by Honorius III., and given by Gregory XV., in\r\n1641, to S. Giuseppe Calasanza, founder of the Order of the Scolopians,\r\nand of the institution of the Scuola Pia. He died in 1648, and is buried\r\nhere in a porphyry sarcophagus.\r\n\r\nAdjoining this, is the very handsome _Palazzo Braschi_, the last result\r\nof papal nepotism in Rome,--built at the end of the last century by\r\nMorelli, for the Duke Braschi, nephew of Pius VI. The staircase, which\r\nis, perhaps, the finest in Rome, is adorned with sixteen columns of red\r\noriental granite. Annual subscription balls for charities are held in\r\nthis palace.\r\n\r\nAt the further corner of the Braschi palace stands the mutilated but\r\nfamous statue called Pasquino, from a witty tailor, who once kept a shop\r\nopposite, and who used to entertain his customers with all the clever\r\nscandal of the day. After the tailor's death his name was transferred to\r\nthe statue, on whose pedestal were appended witty criticisms on passing\r\nevents, sometimes in the form of dialogues which Pasquino was supposed\r\nto hold with his friend Marforio, another statue at the foot of the\r\nCapitol. From the repartees appended to this statue the term Pasquinade\r\nis derived.\r\n\r\nPasquin has naturally been regarded as a mortal enemy by the popes, who,\r\non several occasions, have made vain attempts to silence him. The\r\nbigoted Adrian VI. wished to have the statue burnt and then thrown into\r\nthe Tiber, but it was saved by the suggestion of Ludovico Suessano, that\r\nhis ashes would turn into frogs, who would croak louder than he had\r\ndone. When Marforio, in the hope of stopping the dialogues, was shut up\r\nin the Capitoline museum, the pope attempted to incarcerate Pasquino\r\nalso, but he was defended by his proprietor, Duke Braschi. Among\r\noffensive Pasquinades which have been placed here are:\r\n\r\n    \"Venditur hic Christus, venduntur dogmata Petri,\r\n    Descendam infernum ne quoque vendar ego.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest Pasquinades were those against the venality and evil\r\nlife of Alexander VI. (Rodrigo Borgia, 1492--1503):\r\n\r\n    \"Vendit Alexander claves, altaria, Christum:\r\n    Emerat ille prius, vendere jure potest.\"\r\n\r\nand,\r\n\r\n    \"Sextus Tarquinius, Sextus Nero--Sextus et iste;\r\n    Semper sub Sextis perdita Roma fuit.\"\r\n\r\nand, upon the body of his son Giovanni, murdered by his brother Cæsar\r\nBorgia, being fished up on the following day from the Tiber:\r\n\r\n    \"Piscatorem hominum re te non, Sexte, putemus,\r\n    Piscaris natum retibus ecce tuum.\"\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the warlike Julius II. (1503--13), of whom it is said\r\nthat he threw the keys of Peter into the Tiber, while marching his army\r\nout of Rome, declaring that the sword of Paul was more useful to him:\r\n\r\n    \"Cum Petri nihil efficiant ad prælia claves,\r\n    Auxilio Pauli forsitan ensis erit.\"\r\n\r\nand, in allusion to his warlike beard:\r\n\r\n    \"Huc barbam Pauli, gladium Pauli, omnia Pauli:\r\n    Claviger ille nihil ad mea vota Petrus.\"\r\n\r\nAt a moment of great unpopularity:\r\n\r\n    \"Julius est Romæ, quid abest? Date, numina, Brutum.\r\n    Nam quoties Romæ est Julius, ilia perit.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the sale of indulgences and benefices by Leo X.:\r\n\r\n    \"Dona date, astantes; versus ne reddite; sola\r\n    Imperat æthereis alma Moneta deis.\"\r\n\r\nand to his love of buffoons:\r\n\r\n    \"Cur non te fingi scurram, Pasquille, rogasti?\r\n    Cum Romæ scurris omnia jam licent.\"\r\n\r\nand with reference to the death of Leo, suddenly, under suspicion of\r\npoison, and without the sacrament:\r\n\r\n    \"Sacra sub extrema, si forte requiritis, horâ\r\n    Cur Leo non potuit sumere: vendiderat.\"\r\n\r\nOn the death of Clement VII. (1534), attributed to the mismanagement of\r\nhis physician, Matteo Curzio:\r\n\r\n    \"Curtius occidit Clementem--Curtius auro\r\n    Donandus, per quem publica parta salus.\"\r\n\r\nTo Paul III. (1534--50) who attempted to silence him, Pasquin replied:\r\n\r\n    \"Ut canerent data multa olim sunt vatibus æra;\r\n    Ut taceam, quantum tu mihi, Paule, dabis.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the spoliation of ancient Rome by Urban VIII.:\r\n\r\n    \"Quod non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the passion of Innocent X. (1644--55) for his sister-in-law,\r\nOlympia Maldacchini:\r\n\r\n    \"Magis amat Olympiam quam Olympum.\"\r\n\r\nUpon Christina of Sweden, who died at Rome, in 1689:\r\n\r\n    \"Regina senza Regno,\r\n    Christiana senza Fede,\r\n    E Donna senza Vergogna.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the severities of the Inquisition during the reign of\r\nInnocent XI. (1676--89):\r\n\r\n     \"Se parliamo, in galera; se scriviamo, impiccati; se stiamo in\r\n     quiete, al santo uffizio. Eh!--che bisogna fare?\"\r\n\r\nTo Francis of Austria, on his visit to Rome:\r\n\r\n    \"Gaudium urbis,--fletus provinciarum,--risus mundi.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an awful storm, and the plunder of the works of art by Napoleon\r\noccurring together:\r\n\r\n    \"L'Altissimo in sù, ci manda la tempesta,\r\n    L'Altissimo qua giù, ci toglia quel che resta,\r\n        E fra le Due Altissimi,\r\n        Stiamo noi malissimi.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the stay of the French in Rome:\r\n\r\n    \"I Francesi son tutti ladri.\"\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Non tutti--ma Buona parte.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst the vain-glorious follies of Pius VI., Pasquin was especially\r\nbitter. Pius finished the sacristry of St. Peter's, and inscribed over\r\nits entrance, \"Quod ad Templi Vaticani ornamentum publico vota\r\nflagitabant, Pius VI. fecit.\" The next day Pasquin retorted:\r\n\r\n    \"Publica! mentiris! Non publica vota fuere,\r\n    Sed tumidi ingenii vota fuere tui.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his nepotism, when building the Braschi palace:\r\n\r\n    \"Tres habuit fauces, et terno Cerberus ore\r\n    Latratus intra Tartara nigra dabat.\r\n    Et tibi plena fame tria sunt vel quatuor ora\r\n    Quæ nulli latrant, quemque sed illa vocant.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in allusion to the self-laudatory inscriptions of this pope upon all\r\nhis buildings, at a time when the two-baiocchi loaf of the common people\r\nwas greatly reduced in size; one of these tiny loaves was exhibited\r\nhere, with the satirical notice, \"Munificentia Pii Sexti.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable of all Pasquin's productions is his\r\nfamous Antithesis Christi:\r\n\r\n    \"Christus regna fugit--Sed vi Papa subjugat urbem.\r\n    Spinosam Christus--Triplicem gerit ille coronam.\r\n    Abluit ille pedes--Reges his oscula præbent.\r\n    Vectigal solvit--Sed clerum hic eximit omnem.\r\n    Pavit oves Christus--Luxum hic sectatur inertem.\r\n    Pauper erat Christus--Regna hic petit omnia mundi.\r\n    Bajulat ille crucem--Hic servis portatur avaris.\r\n    Spernit opes Christus--Auri hic ardore tabescit.\r\n    Vendentes pepulit templo--Quos suscipit iste.\r\n    Pace venit Christus--Venit hic radiantibus armis.\r\n    Christus mansuetus venit--Venit ille superbus.\r\n    Quas leges dedit hic--Præsul dissolvit iniquus.\r\n    Ascendit Christus--Descendit ad infera Præsul.\"\r\n\r\nThe statue called Pasquin is said to represent Menelaus with the body of\r\nPatroclus, and to be the same as two groups which still exist at\r\nFlorence, but so little remains of either of these heroes, that it could\r\nonly have been when overpowered by \"L'esprit de contradiction,\" that\r\nBernini protested that this was \"the finest piece of ancient sculpture\r\nin Rome.\"\r\n\r\n     \"A l'angle que forment deux rues de Rome se voit encore il\r\n     Pasquino, nom donné par le peuple à un des plus beaux restes de la\r\n     sculpture antique. Bernin, qui exagérait, disait le plus beau;\r\n     cette assertion fut sur le point d'attirer un duel à celui qui se\r\n     l'était permise. Tout homme qui s'avise d'avoir une opinion sur les\r\n     monuments de Rome s'applaudira pour son compte, en le regrettant\r\n     peut-être, qu'on ne prenne plus si à cœur les questions\r\n     archéologiques.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rome_, iii. 440.\r\n\r\n     \"Jan. 16, 1870: The public opinion of Rome has only one traditional\r\n     organ. It is that mutilated block of marble called Pasquin's statue\r\n     ... on which are mysteriously affixed by unknown hands the frequent\r\n     squibs of Roman mother-wit on the events of the day. That organ has\r\n     now uttered its cutting joke on the Fathers in Council. Some\r\n     mornings ago there was found pasted in big letters on this defaced\r\n     and truncated stump of a once choice statue the inscription,\r\n     'Libero come il Concilio.' The sarcasm is admirably to the\r\n     point.\"--_Times._\r\n\r\nFollowing the Via dell' Anima from hence, on the right, opposite the\r\nmediæval _Torre Mellina_, is the _Church of Sant' Agnese_. It was built\r\nin 1642 by Girolamo Rainaldi, in the form of a Greek cross, upon the\r\nsite of the scaffold where St. Agnes, in her fourteenth year, was\r\ncompelled to be burnt alive.[306] When\r\n\r\n     \"The blessed Agnes, with her hands extended in the midst of the\r\n     flames, prayed thus: 'It is to thee that I appeal, to thee, the\r\n     all-powerful, adorable, perfect, terrible God. O my Father, it is\r\n     through thy most blessed Son that I have escaped from the menaces\r\n     of a sacrilegious tyrant, and have passed unblemished through\r\n     shameful abominations. And thus I come to thee, to thee whom I have\r\n     loved, to thee whom I have sought, and whom I have always\r\n     chosen.\"--_Roman Breviary._\r\n\r\nThen the flames, miraculously changed into a heavenly shower, refreshed\r\ninstead of burning her, and dividing in two, and leaving her uninjured,\r\nconsumed her executioners, and the virgin saint cried:--\r\n\r\n     \"I bless Thee, O Father of my God and Saviour Jesus Christ, who, by\r\n     the power of this thy well-beloved Son, commanded the fire to\r\n     respect me.\"\r\n\r\n     \"At this age, a young girl trembles at an angry look from her\r\n     mother; the prick of a needle draws tears as easily as a wound. Yet\r\n     fearless under the bloody hands of her executioners, Agnes is\r\n     immoveable under the heavy chains which weigh her down; ignorant of\r\n     death, but ready to die, she presents her body to the point of the\r\n     sword of a savage soldier. Dragged against her will to the altar,\r\n     she holds forth her arms to Christ through the fires of the\r\n     sacrifice; and her hand forms even in those blasphemous flames the\r\n     sign which is the trophy of a victorious Saviour. She presents her\r\n     neck and her two hands to the fetters which they bring for her, but\r\n     it is impossible to find any small enough to encircle her delicate\r\n     limbs.\"--_St. Ambrose._\r\n\r\nThe statue of St. Sebastian in this church is an antique, altered by\r\n_Maini_, that of St. Agnes is by _Ercole Ferrata_; the bas-relief of St.\r\nCecilia is by _Antonio Raggi_. Over the entrance is the half-length\r\nfigure and tomb of Innocent X. (Gio. Battista Pamfili, 1644--55), an\r\namiable but feeble pope, who was entirely governed by his strong-minded\r\nand avaricious sister-in-law, Olympia Maldacchini, who deserted him on\r\nhis death-bed, making off with the accumulated spoils of his ten years'\r\npapacy, which enabled her son, Don Camillo, to build the Palazzo Doria\r\nPamfili, in the Corso, and the beautiful Villa Doria Pamfili.[307]\r\n\r\n     \"After the three days during which the body of Innocent remained\r\n     exposed at St. Peter's, say the memoirs of the time, no one could\r\n     be found who would undertake his burial. They sent to tell Donna\r\n     Olympia to prepare for him a coffin, and an escutcheon, but she\r\n     answered that she was a poor widow. Of all his other relations and\r\n     nephews, not one gave any sign of life; so that at length the body\r\n     was carried away into a chamber where the masons kept their tools.\r\n     Some one, out of pity, placed a lighted tallow-candle near the\r\n     head; and some one else having mentioned that the room was full of\r\n     rats, and that they might eat the corpse, a person was found who\r\n     was willing to pay for a watcher. And after another day had\r\n     elapsed, Monsignor Scotti, the majordomo, had pity upon him, and\r\n     prepared him a coffin of poplar-wood, and Monsignor Segni, Canon of\r\n     St. Peter's, who had been his majordomo, and whom he had dismissed,\r\n     returned him good for evil, and expended five crowns for his\r\n     burial.\"--_Gregorovius._\r\n\r\nBeneath the church are vaulted chambers, said to be part of the house of\r\ninfamy where St. Agnes was publicly exposed[308] before her execution.\r\n\r\n     \"As neither temptation nor the fear of death could prevail with\r\n     Agnes, Sempronius thought of other means to vanquish her\r\n     resistance; he ordered her to be carried by force to a place of\r\n     infamy, and exposed to the most degrading outrages. The soldiers,\r\n     who dragged her thither, stripped her of her garments; and when she\r\n     saw herself thus exposed, she bent down her head in meek shame and\r\n     prayed; and immediately her hair, which was already long and\r\n     abundant, became like a veil, covering her whole person from head\r\n     to foot; and those who looked upon her were seized with awe and\r\n     fear as of something sacred, and dared not lift their eyes. So they\r\n     shut her up in a chamber, and she prayed that the limbs which had\r\n     been consecrated to Jesus Christ should not be dishonoured, and\r\n     suddenly she saw before her a white and shining garment, with which\r\n     she clothed herself joyfully, praising God, and saying, 'I thank\r\n     thee, O Lord, that I am found worthy to put on the garment of thine\r\n     elect!' and the whole place was filled with miraculous light,\r\n     brighter than the sun at noon-day.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"The chamber, which, for her preservation, was filled with heavenly\r\n     light, has become, from the change of level all over Rome, as well\r\n     as from the position of the church, a subterranean cell, and is now\r\n     a chapel of peculiar sanctity, into which you descend by\r\n     torchlight. The floor retains the old mosaic, and over the altar is\r\n     a bas-relief, representing St. Agnes, with clasped hands, and\r\n     covered only by her long tresses, while two ferocious soldiers\r\n     drive her before them. The upper church, as a piece of\r\n     architecture, is beautiful, and rich in precious marbles and\r\n     antique columns. The works of art are all mediocre, and of the 17th\r\n     century, but the statue over her altar has considerable elegance.\r\n     Often have I seen the steps of this church, and the church itself,\r\n     so crowded with kneeling worshippers at matins and vespers, that I\r\n     could not make my way among them;--principally the women of the\r\n     lower orders, with their distaffs and market baskets, who had come\r\n     thither to pray, through the intercession of the patron saint, for\r\n     the gifts of meekness and chastity,--gifts not abounding in these\r\n     regions.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\nYorkshire maidens, anxious to know who their future spouse is to be,\r\nstill consult St. Agnes on St Agnes' Eve, after 24 hours' abstinence\r\nfrom everything but pure spring water, in the distich:\r\n\r\n    \"St. Agnes, be a friend to me,\r\n    In the boon I ask of thee;\r\n    Let me this night my husband see.\"\r\n\r\nHere, on the festival of St. Agnes, the papal choir sing the antiphons\r\nof the virgin saint, and the hymn \"Jesu Corona Virginum.\"\r\n\r\nThe front of Sant' Agnese opens upon the _Piazza Navona_, a vast oblong\r\nsquare on the site of the ancient Circus Agonalis, decorated with three\r\nfountains. That in the centre, by Bernini, supports an obelisk brought\r\nfrom the Circus of Maxentius, where it was erected in honour of\r\nDomitian. Around the mass of rock which supports the obelisk are figures\r\nof the gods of the four largest rivers (Danube, Nile, Ganges, Rio de la\r\nPlata). That of the Nile veiled his face, said Bernini, that he might\r\nnot be shocked by the façade which was added by Borromini to the Church\r\nof St Agnes.\r\n\r\n     \"Bernin s'ingéra de creuser un des fameux piliers de St. Pierre\r\n     pour y pratiquer un petit escalier montant à la tribune; aussitôt\r\n     le dôme prit coup et se fendit. On fut obligé de le relier tout\r\n     entier avec un cercle de fer. Ce n'est point raillerie, le cercle y\r\n     est encore; le mal n'a pas augmenté depuis. Par malheur pour le\r\n     pauvre cavalier, on trouva dans les Mémoires de Michel-Ange qu'il\r\n     avait recommandé, _sub pœnâ capitis_, de ne jamais toucher aux\r\n     quatre piliers massifs faits pour supporter le dôme, sachant de\r\n     quelle masse épouvantable il allait les charger; le pape voulait\r\n     faire pendre Bernin, qui, pour se rédimer, inventa la fontaine\r\n     Navone.\"--_De Brosses._\r\n\r\nThe lower fountain, also by Bernini, is adorned with tritons and the\r\nfigure of a Moor. The great palace to the right of the church is the\r\n_Palazzo Pamfili_, built by Rainaldi for Innocent X. in 1650. It\r\npossesses a ceiling painted by _Pietro di Cortona_ with the adventures\r\nof Eneas. Its music-hall is still occasionally used for public\r\nconcerts.\r\n\r\nIt was in this palace that the notorious Olympia Maldacchini, foundress\r\nof the Pamfili fortunes, besported herself during the reign of her\r\nbrother-in-law, Innocent X.\r\n\r\n     \"The great object of Donna Olympia was to keep at a distance from\r\n     Innocent every person and every influence that could either lessen\r\n     her own, or go shares in the profits to be extracted from it. For\r\n     this, after all, was the great and ultimate scope of her exertions.\r\n     To secure the profits of the papacy in hard cash; this was the\r\n     problem. No appointment to office of any kind was made, except in\r\n     consideration of a proportionable sum paid down into her own\r\n     coffers. This often amounted to three or four years' revenue of the\r\n     place to be granted. Bishoprics and benefices were sold as fast as\r\n     they became vacant. One story is told of an unlucky disciple of\r\n     Simon, who on treating with the popess, for a very valuable see,\r\n     just fallen vacant, and hearing from her a price, at which it might\r\n     be his, far exceeding all he could command, persuaded the members\r\n     of his family to sell all they had for the purpose of making this\r\n     profitable investment. The price was paid, and the bishopric was\r\n     given to him, but with a fearful resemblance to the case of\r\n     Ananias, he died within the year; and his ruined family saw the see\r\n     a second time sold by the insatiable and incorrigible Olympia....\r\n     During the last year of Innocent's life, Olympia literally hardly\r\n     ever quitted him. Once a week, we read, she left the Vatican,\r\n     secretly by night, accompanied by several porters carrying sacks of\r\n     coin, the proceeds of the week's extortions and sales, to her own\r\n     palace. And, during these short absences, she used to lock the pope\r\n     into his chamber, and take the key with her!\"--_Trollope's Life of\r\n     Olympia Pamfili._\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the piazza, some architectural fragments denote\r\nthe half-ruined _Church of S. Giacomo degli Spagnuoli_ of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. It possesses a gothic rose window, which is almost unique in\r\nRome. There is a handsome door on the other side towards the Via della\r\nSediola. The lower end of the square near this is occupied by the\r\n_Palazzo Lancellotti_, built by Pirro Ligorio, behind which is the\r\nfrescoed front of Palazzo Massimo, mentioned above. The Piazza Navona\r\nhas been used as a market ever since 1447. In the hot months, the\r\nsingular custom prevails of occasionally stopping the escape of water\r\nfrom the fountains, and so turning the square into a lake, through which\r\nthe rich splash about in carriages, and eat ices and drink coffee in the\r\nwater, while the poor look on from raised galleries. It is supposed that\r\nthis practice is a remnant of the pleasures of the Naumachia, once\r\nannually exhibited almost on this very spot, formerly the Circus\r\nAgonalis.\r\n\r\nVitale Mascardi gives an extraordinary account of the magnificent\r\ntournament held here in 1634 in honour of the visit of Prince Alexander\r\nof Poland, when the piazza was hung with draperies of gold and silver,\r\nand Donna Anna Colonna and Donna Costanza Barberini awarded gorgeous\r\nprizes of diamonds to noble and princely competitors.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite Sant' Agnese, a short street leads (passing on the left,\r\nArvotti's, the famous Roman-scarf shop) to the front of the _Palazzo\r\nMadama_, which is sometimes said to derive its name from Margaret of\r\nParma, daughter of Charles V., who once occupied it, and sometimes from\r\nCatherine de' Medici, who also lived here, and under whom it was altered\r\nin its present form by Paolo Marucelli. The balcony towards the piazza\r\nis the scene every Saturday at noon of the drawing of the Roman lottery.\r\n\r\n     \"In the middle of the balcony, on the rail, is fixed a glass\r\n     barrel, with a handle to turn it round. Behind it stand three or\r\n     four officials, who have been just now ushered in with a blast from\r\n     two trumpeters, also stationed in the balcony. Immediately behind\r\n     the glass barrel itself stands a boy of some twelve or thirteen\r\n     years, dressed in the white uniform of one of the orphan\r\n     establishments, with a huge white shovel hat. Some time is occupied\r\n     by the folding, and putting into the barrel, pieces of paper,\r\n     inscribed with the numbers, from one onwards. Each of these is\r\n     proclaimed, as folded and put in, by one of the officials who acts\r\n     as spokesman or crier. At last, after eighty-seven, eighty-eight,\r\n     and eighty-nine have been given out, he raises his voice to a\r\n     chant, and sings forth, _Numero novanta_, 'number ninety,' this\r\n     completing the number put in.\r\n\r\n     \"And now, or before this, appears on the balcony another\r\n     character--no less a person than a Monsignore, who appears, not in\r\n     his ordinary, but in his more solemn official costume; and this\r\n     connects the ceremonial directly with the spiritual authority of\r\n     the realm. And now commences the drawing. The barrel having been\r\n     for some time turned rapidly round to shuffle the numbers, the\r\n     orphan takes off his hat, makes the sign of the cross, and having\r\n     waved his open hand in the air to show that it is empty, inserts it\r\n     into the barrel, and draws out a number, giving it to the\r\n     Monsignore, who opens it and hands it to the crier. This latter\r\n     then proclaims it--'_Prima-estratta, numero venti cinque_.' Then\r\n     the trumpets blow their blast, and the same is repeated four times\r\n     more: the proclamation varying each time, _Seconda estratta_,\r\n     _Terza_, _Quatra_, _Quinta_, etc., five numbers being thus the\r\n     whole drawn, out of ninety put in. This done, with various\r\n     expressions of surprise, delight, or disappointment from the crowd\r\n     below, the officials disappear, the square empties itself, and all\r\n     is as usual till the next Saturday at the same time....\r\n\r\n     \"In almost every street in Rome are shops devoted to the purchase\r\n     of lottery tickets. Two numbers purchased with the double chance of\r\n     these two numbers turning up are called an _ambo_, and three\r\n     purchased with the treble chance of those three turning up, are\r\n     called a _terno_, and, of course, the higher and more perilous the\r\n     stake, the richer the prize, if obtained.\"--_Alford's Letters from\r\n     Abroad._\r\n\r\n     \"Les étrangers qui viennent à Rome commencent par blâmer sévèrement\r\n     la loterie. Au bout de quelque temps, l'esprit de tolérance qui est\r\n     dans l'air pénètre peu-à-peu jusqu'au fond de leur cerveau; ils\r\n     excusent un jeu philanthropique qui fournit au pauvre peuple six\r\n     jours d'espérances pour cinq sous. Bientôt, pour se rendre compte\r\n     du mécanisme de la loterie, ils entrent euxmêmes dans un bureau, en\r\n     évitant de se laisser voir. Trois mois après, ils poursuivent\r\n     ouvertement une combinaison savante; ils ont une théorie\r\n     mathématique qu'ils signeraient volontiers de leur nom; ils donnent\r\n     des leçons aux nouveaux arrivés; ils érigent le jeu en principe et\r\n     jurent qu'un homme est impardonnable s'il ne laisse pas une porte\r\n     ouverte à la Fortune.\"--_About, Rome Contemporaine._\r\n\r\nThe court at the back of the palazzo is now occupied by the General Post\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nClose by is the _Church of S. Luigi dei Francesi_, rebuilt 1589, with a\r\nfaçade by Giacomo della Porta. It contains a number of tombs of eminent\r\nFrenchmen who have died in Rome, and some good pictures.\r\n\r\nFollowing the right aisle, the second chapel has frescoes from the life\r\nof Sta. Cecilia, by _Domenichino_ (she gives clothes to the poor,--is\r\ncrowned by an angel with her husband Valerian,--refuses to sacrifice to\r\nidols,--suffers martyrdom,--enters into heaven).\r\n\r\n     \"Domenichino is often cold and studied in the principal subject,\r\n     while the subordinate persons have much grace, and a noble\r\n     character of beauty. Of this the two frescoes in S. Luigi at Rome,\r\n     from the life of Sta. Cecilia, are striking examples. It is not the\r\n     saint herself, bestowing her goods from a balcony, who contributes\r\n     the chief subject, but the masterly group of poor people struggling\r\n     for them below. The same may be said of the death of the saint,\r\n     where the admiration and grief of the bystanders are\r\n     inimitable.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     \"Reclining on a couch, in the centre of the picture, her hand\r\n     pressed on her bosom, her dying eyes raised to heaven, the saint is\r\n     breathing her last; while female forms, of exquisite beauty and\r\n     innocence, are kneeling around, or bending over her. The noble\r\n     figure of an old man, whose clasped hands and bent brow seem to\r\n     bespeak a father's affection, appears on one side; and lovely\r\n     children, in all the playful graces of unconscious infancy, as\r\n     usual in Domenichino's paintings, by contrast heighten, yet\r\n     relieve, the deep pathos of the scene. From above, an angel--such\r\n     an angel as Domenichino alone knew how to paint, a cherub form of\r\n     light and loveliness--is descending on rapid wing, bearing to the\r\n     expiring saint the crown and palm of glory.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nThe copy of Raphael's Sta. Cecilia over the altar is by _Guido_. The\r\nfourth chapel has on the right frescoes by _Girolamo Sicciolante_, on\r\nthe left by _Pellegrino da Bologna_, the altar-piece is by _Giacomo del\r\nConte_. The fifth chapel has on the right the monument of Agincourt (ob.\r\n1814), the famous archæologist, on the left that of Guerin the painter.\r\n\r\nThe high altar has an Assumption by _Bassano_.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel in the left aisle has a St. Sebastian by _Massei_. In\r\nthe fifth chapel, of St. Matthew, three pictures by _Caravaggio_\r\nrepresent the vocation and martyrdom of that saint.\r\n\r\n     \"The paintings of Caravaggio at S. Luigi belong to his most\r\n     comprehensive works. The Martyrdom of St Matthew, with the angel\r\n     with a palm branch squatting upon a cloud, and a boy running away,\r\n     screaming, though highly animated, is an offensive production. On\r\n     the other hand, the Calling of the Apostle may be considered as a\r\n     _genre_ picture of grand characteristic figures; for instance,\r\n     those of the money-changers and publican at the table; some of them\r\n     counting money, others looking up astonished at the entrance of the\r\n     Saviour.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     \"Over the altar is St. Matthew writing his Gospel; he looks up at\r\n     the attendant angel, who is behind with outspread wings, and in the\r\n     act of dictating. On the left is the Calling of St. Matthew: the\r\n     saint, who has been counting money, rises with one hand on his\r\n     breast, and turns to follow the Saviour: an old man, with\r\n     spectacles on his nose, examines with curiosity the personage whose\r\n     summons has had such a miraculous effect: a boy is slyly\r\n     appropriating the money which the apostle has thrown down. The\r\n     third picture is the martyrdom of the saint, who, in the sacerdotal\r\n     habit, lies extended on a block; while a half-naked executioner\r\n     raises the sword, and several spectators shrink back with horror.\r\n     There is nothing dignified or poetical in these representations;\r\n     and though painted with all that power of effect which\r\n     characterized Caravaggio, then at the height of his reputation,\r\n     they have also his coarseness of feeling and execution: the priests\r\n     were (not without reason) dissatisfied; and it required all the\r\n     influence of his patron, Cardinal Giustiniani, to induce them to\r\n     retain the pictures in the church where we now see\r\n     them.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 146.\r\n\r\nAmongst the monuments scattered over this church are those of Cardinal\r\nd'Ossat, ambassador of Henry IV.; Cardinal de la Grange d'Arquien,\r\nfather-in-law of Sobieski, who died at the age of 105; Cardinal de la\r\nTrémouille, ambassador of Louis XIV.; Madame de Montmorin, with an\r\nepitaph by Chateaubriand; and Claude Lorraine, who is buried at the\r\nTrinità di Monti.\r\n\r\nThe pillars which separate the nave and aisles are of splendid Sicilian\r\njasper. They were intended for S. Ignazio, but when the Order of the\r\nJesuits was dissolved by Clement XIV., he presented them to S. Luigi.\r\n\r\nThe site of this church, the Palazzo Madama, and their adjoining\r\nbuildings, was once occupied by the baths of Nero. They are commemorated\r\nby the name of the small church \"S. Salvatore in Thermis.\"\r\n\r\nIn front of S. Luigi are the _Palaces Patrizi and Giustiniani_, and,\r\nfollowing--to the right--the Via della Sediola, on the left is the\r\nentrance to the _University of the Sapienza_, founded by Innocent IV. in\r\n1244 as a law school. Its buildings were begun by Pius III. and Julius\r\nII., and extended by Leo X. on plans of Michael Angelo. The portico was\r\nbuilt under Gregory XIII. by Giacomo della Porta. The northern façade\r\nwas erected by Borromini, with the ridiculous church (S. Ivo), built in\r\nthe form of a bee to flatter Urban VIII., that insect being his device.\r\nThe building is called the Sapienza, from the motto, \"Initium Sapientiæ\r\ntimor Domini,\" engraved over the window above the principal entrance.\r\nForty professors teach here all the different branches of law, medicine,\r\ntheology, philosophy, and philology.\r\n\r\nBehind the Sapienza is the small _Piazza di S. Eustachio_, containing on\r\nthree sides the Giustiniani, Lante, and Maccarini palaces, and\r\ncelebrated for the festival of the Befana,[309] which takes place here.\r\n\r\n     \"The Piazza and all the adjacent streets are lined with booths\r\n     covered with every kind of plaything for children. These booths are\r\n     gaily illuminated with rows of candles and the three-wick'd brass\r\n     _lucerne_ of Rome; and at intervals, painted posts are set into the\r\n     pavement, crowned with pans of grease, with a wisp of tow for\r\n     wick, from which flames blaze and flare about. Besides these,\r\n     numbers of torches carried about by hand lend a wavering and\r\n     picturesque light to the scene. By eight o'clock in the evening\r\n     crowds begin to fill the piazza and the adjacent streets. Long\r\n     before one arrives the squeak of penny-trumpets is heard at\r\n     intervals; but in the piazza itself the mirth is wild and furious,\r\n     and the din that salutes one's ears on entering is almost\r\n     deafening. The object of every one is to make as much noise as\r\n     possible, and every kind of instrument for this purpose is sold at\r\n     the booths. There are drums beating, _tamburelli_ thumping and\r\n     jingling, pipes squeaking, watchman's rattles clacking,\r\n     penny-trumpets and tin-horns shrilling, the sharpest whistles\r\n     shrieking,--and mingling with these is heard the din of voices,\r\n     screams of laughter, and the confused burr and buzz of a great\r\n     crowd. On all sides you are saluted by the strangest noises.\r\n     Instead of being spoken to, you are whistled at. Companies of\r\n     people are marching together in platoons, or piercing through the\r\n     crowd in long files, and dancing and blowing like mad on their\r\n     instruments. It is a perfect witches' Sabbath. Here, huge dolls\r\n     dressed as Polichinello or Pantaloon are borne about for sale,--or\r\n     over the heads of the crowd great black-faced jumping-jacks, lifted\r\n     on a stick, twitch themselves in fantastic fits,--or, what is more\r\n     Roman than all, long poles are carried about strung with rings of\r\n     hundreds of _Giambelli_ (a light cake, called jumble in English),\r\n     which are screamed for sale at a _mezzo baiocco_ each. There is no\r\n     alternative but to get a drum, whistle, or trumpet, and join in the\r\n     racket,--and to fill one's pocket with toys for the children, and\r\n     absurd presents for one's older friends. The moment you are once in\r\n     for it, and making as much noise as you can, you begin to relish\r\n     the jest. The toys are very odd, particularly the Roman whistles;\r\n     some of these are made of pewter, with a little wheel that whirls\r\n     as you blow; others are of terra-cotta, very rudely modelled into\r\n     every shape of bird, beast, or human deformity, each with a whistle\r\n     in its head, breast, or tail, which it is no joke to hear, when\r\n     blown close to your ears by a stout pair of lungs. The scene is\r\n     extremely picturesque. Above, the dark vault of night, with its far\r\n     stars, the blazing and flaring of lights below, and the great, dark\r\n     walls of the Sapienza and church looking down grimly upon the\r\n     mirth.\"--_Story's Roba di Roma._\r\n\r\nThe _Church of S. Eustachio_ commemorates one, who, first a brave\r\nsoldier of the army of Titus in Palestine, became master of the horse\r\nunder Trajan, and general under Hadrian, and who suffered martyrdom for\r\nrefusing to sacrifice to idols, by being roasted alive in a brazen bull\r\nbefore the Coliseum, with his wife Theophista, and his sons, Agapetus\r\nand Theophistus. The relics of these saints repose in a porphyry\r\nsarcophagus under the high altar. The stags' heads on the portico and on\r\nthe apex of the gable refer to the legend of the conversion of St.\r\nEustace.\r\n\r\n     \"One day, while hunting in the forest, he saw before him a white\r\n     stag, of marvellous beauty, and he pursued it eagerly, and the stag\r\n     fled before him, and ascended a high rock. Then Placidus (Eustace\r\n     was called Placidus before his conversion), looking up, beheld,\r\n     between the horns of the stag, a cross of radiant light, and on it\r\n     the image of the crucified Redeemer; and being astonished and\r\n     dazzled by this vision, he fell on his knees, and a voice which\r\n     seemed to come from the crucifix cried to him, and said, 'Placidus!\r\n     why dost thou pursue me? I am Christ, whom thou hast hitherto\r\n     served without knowing me. Dost thou now believe?' And Placidus\r\n     fell with his face to the earth, and said, 'Lord, I believe!' And\r\n     the voice answered, saying, 'Thou shall suffer many tribulations\r\n     for my sake, and shalt be tried by many temptations; but be strong\r\n     and of good courage, and I will not forsake thee.' To which\r\n     Placidus replied, 'Lord, I am content. Do thou give me patience to\r\n     suffer!' And when he looked up again the glorious vision had\r\n     departed.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 792.\r\n\r\nA similar story is told of St. Hubert, St. Julian, and St. Felix.\r\n\r\nA fresco of St. Peter, by _Pierino del Vaga_, in this church, was much\r\nadmired by Vasari, who dilates upon the boldness of its design, the\r\nsimple folds of its drapery, its careful drawing and judicious\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nTwo streets lead from the Piazza S. Eustachio to--\r\n\r\n_The Pantheon_, the most perfect pagan building in the city, built B.C.\r\n27, by Marcus Agrippa, the bosom friend of Augustus Cæsar, and the\r\nsecond husband of his daughter Julia. The inscription in huge letters,\r\nperfectly legible from beneath, \"M. AGRIPPA. L. F. COS. TERTIUM FECIT,\"\r\nrecords its construction. Another inscription on the architrave, now\r\nalmost illegible, records its restoration under Septimius Severus and\r\nhis son Caracalla, _c._ 202, who, \"Pantheum vetustate corruptum cum omni\r\ncultu restitverunt.\" Some authorities have maintained that the Pantheon\r\nwas originally only a vast hall in the baths of Agrippa, acknowledged\r\nremains of which exist at no great distance; but the name \"Pantheum\" was\r\nin use as early as A.D. 59.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 399 the Pantheon was closed as a temple in obedience to a decree\r\nof the Emperor Honorius, and in 608 was consecrated as a Christian\r\nchurch by Pope Boniface IV., with the permission of the Emperor Phocas,\r\nunder the title of _Sta. Maria ad Martyres_. To this dedication we owe\r\nthe preservation of the main features of the building, though it had\r\nbeen terribly maltreated. In 663 the Emperor Constans, who had come to\r\nRome with great pretence of devotion to its shrines and relics, and who\r\nonly staid there twelve days, did not scruple, in spite of its religious\r\ndedication, to strip off the tiles of gilt bronze with which the roof\r\nwas covered, and carry them off with him to Syracuse, where, upon his\r\nmurder, a few years after, they fell into the hands of the Saracens. In\r\n1087 it was used by the anti-pope Guibert as a fortress, whence he made\r\nincursions upon the lawful pope, Victor III., and his protector, the\r\nCountess Matilda. In 1101, another anti-pope, Sylvester IV., was elected\r\nhere. Pope Martin V., after the return from Avignon, attempted the\r\nrestoration of the Pantheon by clearing away the mass of miserable\r\nbuildings in which it was encrusted, and his efforts were continued by\r\nEugenius IV., but Urban VIII. (1623--44), though he spent 15,000 scudi\r\nupon the Pantheon, and added the two ugly campaniles, called in\r\nderision \"the asses' ears,\" of their architect, Bernini, did not\r\nhesitate to plunder the gilt bronze ceiling of the portico, 450,250 lbs.\r\nin weight, to make the baldacchino of St. Peter's, and cannons for the\r\nCastle of S. Angelo. Benedict XIV. (1740--58) further despoiled the\r\nbuilding by tearing away all the precious marbles which lined the attic,\r\nto ornament other buildings.\r\n\r\nThe Pantheon was not originally, as now, below the level of the piazza,\r\nbut was approached by a flight of five steps. The portico, which is 110\r\nfeet long and 44 feet deep, is supported by sixteen grand Corinthian\r\ncolumns of oriental granite, 36 feet in height. The ancient bronze doors\r\nremain. On either side are niches, once occupied by colossal statues of\r\nAugustus and Agrippa.\r\n\r\n     \"Agrippa wished to dedicate the Pantheon to Augustus, but he\r\n     refused, and only allowed his statue to occupy a niche on the right\r\n     of the peristyle, while that of Agrippa occupied the niche on the\r\n     left.\"--_Merivale._\r\n\r\nThe _Interior_ is a rotunda, 143 feet in diameter, covered by a dome. It\r\nis only lighted by an aperture in the centre, 28 feet in diameter. Seven\r\ngreat niches around the walls once contained statues of different gods\r\nand goddesses, that of Jupiter being the central figure. All the\r\nsurrounding columns are of giallo-antico, except four, which are of\r\npavonazzetto, painted yellow. It is a proof of the great value and\r\nrarity of giallo-antico, that it was always impossible to obtain more to\r\ncomplete the set.\r\n\r\n     \"L'intérieur du Panthéon, comme l'extérieur, est parfaitement\r\n     conservé, et les édicules, placés dans le pourtour du temple\r\n     forment les chapelles de l'église. Jamais la simplicité ne fut\r\n     alliée à la grandeur dans une plus heureuse harmonie. Le jour,\r\n     tombant d'en haut et glissant le long des colonnes et des parois de\r\n     marbre, porte dans l'âme un sentiment de tranquillité sublime, et\r\n     donne à tous les objets, dit Serlio, un air de beauté. Vue du\r\n     dehors, la coupole de plomb qui a remplacé l'ancienne coupole de\r\n     bronze couverte de tuiles dorées, fait bien comprendre l'expression\r\n     de Virgile, lequel l'avait sous les yeux et peut-être en vue, quand\r\n     il écrivait:\r\n\r\n    ... 'Media testudine templi.'\r\n\r\n     En effet, cette coupole surbaissée ressemble tout à fait à la\r\n     carapace d'une tortue.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ i. 342.\r\n\r\n     \"Being deep in talk, it so happened that they found themselves near\r\n     the majestic, pillared portico and huge black rotundity of the\r\n     Pantheon. It stands almost at the central point of the labyrinthine\r\n     intricacies of the modern city, and often presents itself before\r\n     the bewildered stranger when he is in search of other objects.\r\n     Hilda, looking up, proposed that they should enter.\r\n\r\n     \"They went in, accordingly, and stood in the free space of that\r\n     great circle, around which are ranged the arched recesses and\r\n     stately altars, formerly dedicated to heathen gods, but\r\n     Christianized through twelve centuries gone by. The world has\r\n     nothing else like the Pantheon. So grand it is, that the pasteboard\r\n     statues over the lofty cornice do not disturb the effect, any more\r\n     than the tin crowns and hearts, the dusty artificial flowers, and\r\n     all manner of trumpery gewgaws, hanging at the saintly shrines. The\r\n     rust and dinginess that have dimmed the precious marble on the\r\n     walls; the pavement, with its great squares and rounds of porphyry\r\n     and granite, cracked crosswise and in a hundred directions, showing\r\n     how roughly the troublesome ages have trampled here; the grey dome\r\n     above, with its opening to the sky, as if heaven were looking down\r\n     into the interior of this place of worship, left unimpeded for\r\n     prayers to ascend the more freely: all these things make an\r\n     impression of solemnity, which St. Peter's itself fails to produce.\r\n\r\n     \"'I think,' said Kenyon, 'it is to the aperture in the dome--that\r\n     great eye, gazing heavenward--that the Pantheon owes the\r\n     peculiarity of its effect. It is so heathenish, as it were--so\r\n     unlike all the snugness of our modern civilization! Look, too, at\r\n     the pavement directly beneath the open space! So much rain has\r\n     fallen there, in the last two thousand years, that it is green with\r\n     small, fine moss, such as grows over tombstones in damp English\r\n     churchyards.'\r\n\r\n     \"'I like better,' replied Hilda, 'to look at the bright, blue sky,\r\n     roofing the edifice where the builders left it open. It is very\r\n     delightful, in a breezy day, to see the masses of white cloud float\r\n     over the opening, and then the sunshine fall through it again,\r\n     fitfully, as it does now. Would it be any wonder if we were to see\r\n     angels hovering there, partly in and partly out, with genial,\r\n     heavenly faces, not intercepting the light, but transmuting it into\r\n     beautiful colours? Look at that broad, golden beam--a sloping\r\n     cataract of sunlight--which comes down from the aperture, and rests\r\n     upon the shrine, at the right hand of the entrance.'\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\n     ... \"'Entrons dans le temple,' dit Corinne: 'vous le voyez, il\r\n     reste découvert presque comme il l'était autrefois. On dit que\r\n     cette lumière qui venait d'en haut était l'emblème de la divinité\r\n     supérieure à toutes les divinités. Les païens ont toujours aimé les\r\n     images symboliques. Il semble en effet que ce langage convient\r\n     mieux à la religion que la parole. La pluie tombe souvent sur ces\r\n     parvis de marbre; mais aussi les rayons du soleil viennent éclairer\r\n     les prières. Quelle sérénité; quel air de fête on remarque dans cet\r\n     édifice! Les païens ont divinisé la vie, et les chrétiens ont\r\n     divinisé la mort: tel est l'esprit des deux cultes.'\"--_Mad. de\r\n     Staël._\r\n\r\n     \"In the ancient Pantheon, when the music of Christian chaunts rises\r\n     among the shadowy forms of the old vanished gods painted on the\r\n     walls, and the light streams down, not from painted windows in the\r\n     walls, but from the glowing heavens above, every note of the\r\n     service echoes like a peal of triumph, and fills my heart with\r\n     thankfulness.\"--_Mrs. Charles._\r\n\r\n     \"'Where,' asked Redschid Pasha, on his visit to the Pantheon, 'are\r\n     the statues of the heathen gods?' 'Of course they were removed when\r\n     the temple was Christianized,' was the natural answer.

H. Clough._\r\n\r\nSome antiquarians have supposed that the aperture at the top of the\r\nPantheon was originally closed by a huge \"Pigna,\" or pine-cone of\r\nbronze, like that which crowned the summit of the mausoleum of Hadrian,\r\nand this belief has been encouraged by the name of a neighbouring church\r\nbeing S. Giovanni della Pigna.\r\n\r\nThe Pantheon has become the burial-place of painters. Raphael, Annibale\r\nCaracci, Taddeo Zucchero, Baldassare Peruzzi, Pierino del Vaga, and\r\nGiovanni da Udine, are all buried here.\r\n\r\nThe third chapel on the left contains the _tomb of Raphael_ (born April\r\n6, 1483; died April 6, 1520). From the pen of Cardinal Bembo is the\r\nepigram:\r\n\r\n    \"Ille hic est Raphael, timuit quo sospite vinci\r\n    Rerum magna parens, et moriente mori\"[310]\r\n\r\n     \"Raphael mourut à l'âge de 37 ans. Son corps resta exposé pendant\r\n     trois jours. Au moment où l'on s'apprêtait à le descendre dans sa\r\n     dernière demeure, on vit arriver le pape (Leon X.) qui se\r\n     prosterna, pria quelques instants, bénit Raphael, et lui prit pour\r\n     la dernière fois la main, qu'il arrosa de ses larmes (si prostrò\r\n     innanzi l'estinto Rafaello et baciogli quella mano, tra le\r\n     lagrime). On lui fit de magnifiques funérailles, auxquelles\r\n     assistèrent les cardinaux, les artistes, &c.\"--_A. Du Pays._\r\n\r\n                      \"When Raphael went,\r\n    His heavenly face the mirror of his mind,\r\n    His mind a temple for all lovely things\r\n    To flock to and inhabit--when He went,\r\n    Wrapt in his sable cloak, the cloak he wore,\r\n    To sleep beneath the venerable Dome,\r\n    By those attended, who in life had loved,\r\n    Had worshipped, following in his steps to Fame,\r\n    ('Twas on an April-day, when Nature smiles,)\r\n    All Rome was there. But, ere the march began,\r\n    Ere to receive their charge the bearers came,\r\n    Who had not sought him? And when all beheld\r\n    Him, where he lay, how changed from yesterday,\r\n    Him in that hour cut off, and at his head\r\n    His last great work;[311] when, entering in, they looked\r\n    Now on the dead, then on that masterpiece,\r\n    Now on his face, lifeless and colourless,\r\n    Then on those forms divine that lived and breathed,\r\n    And would live on for ages--all were moved;\r\n    And sighs burst forth, and loudest lamentations.\"\r\n\r\n    _Rogers._\r\n\r\nTaddeo Zucchero and Annibale Caracci are buried on either side of\r\nRaphael. Near the high altar is a monument to Cardinal Gonsalvi\r\n(1757--1824), the faithful secretary and minister of Pius VII., by\r\n_Thorwaldsen_. This, however, is only a cenotaph, marking the spot where\r\nhis heart is preserved. His body rests with that of his beloved brother\r\nAndrew in the church of S. Marcello.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle ages the pope always officiated here on the day of\r\nPentecost, when, in honour of the descent of the Holy Spirit, showers of\r\nwhite rose-leaves were continually sent down through the aperture during\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n     \"Though plundered of all its brass, except the ring which was\r\n     necessary to preserve the aperture above; though exposed to\r\n     repeated fire; though sometimes flooded by the river, and always\r\n     open to the rain, no monument of equal antiquity is so well\r\n     preserved as this rotunda. It passed with little alteration from\r\n     the pagan into the present worship; and so convenient were its\r\n     niches for the Christian altar, that Michael Angelo, ever studious\r\n     of ancient beauty, introduced their design as a model in the\r\n     Catholic church.\"--_Forsyth._\r\n\r\n    \"Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime--\r\n    Shrine of all saints and temple of all gods,\r\n    From Jove to Jesus--spared and bless'd by time,\r\n    Looking tranquillity, while falls or nods\r\n    Arch, empire, each thing round thee, and man plods\r\n    His way through thorns to ashes--glorious dome!\r\n    Shalt thou not last?

Here are Java sparrows, parrots and\r\n     parroquets, grey thrushes and nightingales, red-breasts (_petti\r\n     rossi_), yellow canary-birds, beautiful sweet-singing little\r\n     _cardellini_, and gentle ringdoves, all chattering, singing, and\r\n     cooing together, to the constant splashing of the fountain. Among\r\n     them, perched on stands, and glaring wisely out of their great\r\n     yellow eyes, may be seen all sorts of owls, from the great solemn\r\n     _barbigiani_, and white-tufted owl, to the curious little\r\n     _civetta_, which gives its name to all sharp-witted heartless\r\n     flirts, and the _aziola_, which Shelley has celebrated in one of\r\n     his minor poems.\"--_Story's Roba di Roma._\r\n\r\n(Following the Via della Rotonda from hence, in the third street on the\r\nleft is the small semicircular ruin called, from a fancied resemblance\r\nto the favourite cake of the people, _Arco di Ciambella_. This is the\r\nonly remaining fragment of the baths of Agrippa, unless the Pantheon\r\nitself was connected with them.)\r\n\r\nBehind the Pantheon, is the _Piazza della Minerva_, where a small\r\n_Obelisk_ was erected 1667 by Bernini, on the back of an elephant. It is\r\nexactly similar to the obelisk in front of the Pantheon, and they were\r\nboth found near this site, where they formed part of the decorations of\r\nthe Campus Martius. The hieroglyphics show that it dates from Hophres,\r\na king of the 25th dynasty. On the pedestal is the inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"Sapientis Ægypti insculptas obelisco figuras\r\n    Ab elephanto belluarum fortissimo gestari\r\n      Quisquis hic vides, documentum intellige\r\n    Robustæ mentis esse solidam sapientiam sustinere.\"\r\n\r\nOne side of the piazza is occupied by the mean ugly front of the _Church\r\nof Sta. Maria sopra Minerva_, built in 1370 upon the ruins of a temple\r\nof Minerva founded by Pompey. It is the only gothic church in Rome of\r\nimportance. In 1848--55 it was redecorated with tawdry imitation\r\nmarbles, which have only a good effect when there is not sufficient\r\nlight to see them. In spite of this, the interior is very interesting,\r\nand its chapels are a perfect museum of relics of art or history. The\r\nservices, too, in this church were, under the papal government,\r\nexceedingly imposing, especially the procession on the night before\r\nChristmas, the mass of St. Thomas Aquinas, and that of \"the white mule\r\nday.\" Some celebrated divine generally preaches here at 11 A.M. every\r\nmorning in Lent.\r\n\r\nHither, on the feast of the Annunciation, comes the famous \"Procession\r\nof the White Mule,\" when the host is borne by the grand almoner riding\r\non the papal mule, followed by the pope in his glass coach, and a long\r\ntrain of cardinals and other dignitaries. Up to the time of Pius VI., it\r\nwas the pope himself who rode upon the white mule, but Pius VII. was too\r\ninfirm, and since his time they have given it up. But this procession\r\nhas continued to be one of the finest _spectacles_ of the kind, and has\r\nbeen an opportunity for a loyal demonstration, balconies being hung with\r\nscarlet draperies, and flowers showered down upon the papal coach,\r\nwhile the pope, on arriving and departing, has usually been received\r\nwith tumultuous \"evivas.\"\r\n\r\nOn the right of the entrance is the tomb of Diotisalvi, a Florentine\r\nknight, ob. 1482. Beginning the circuit of the church by the right\r\naisle, the first chapel has a picture of S. Ludovico Bertrando, by\r\n_Baciccio_, the paintings on the pilasters being by _Muziano_. In the\r\nsecond, the Colonna Chapel, is the tomb of the late Princess Colonna\r\n(Donna Isabella Alvaria of Toledo) and her child, who both died at\r\nAlbano in the cholera of 1867. The third chapel is that of the Gabrielli\r\nfamily. The fourth is that of the Annunciation. Over its altar is a most\r\ninteresting picture, shown as a work of Fra Angelico, but more probably\r\nthat of _Benozzo Gozzoli_. It represents Monsignore Torquemada attended\r\nby an angel, presenting three young girls to the Virgin, who gives them\r\ndowries: the Almighty is seen in the clouds. Torquemada was a Dominican\r\nCardinal, who founded the association of the Santissima-Annunziata,\r\nwhich holds its meetings in this chapel, and which annually gives\r\ndowries to a number of poor girls, who receive them from the pope when\r\nhe comes here in state on the 25th of March. On this occasion, the girls\r\nwho are to receive the dowries are drawn up in two lines in front of the\r\nchurch. Some are distinguished by white wreaths. They are those who are\r\ngoing to \"enter into religion,\" and who consequently receive double the\r\ndowry of the others, on the plea that \"money placed in the hands of\r\nreligion bears interest for the poor.\"\r\n\r\nTorquemada is himself buried in this chapel, opposite the tomb, by\r\nAmbrogio Buonvicino, of his friend Urban VII., Giov. Battista Castagna,\r\n1590,--who was pope only for eleven days.\r\n\r\nThe fifth chapel is the burial-place of the Aldobrandini family. It\r\ncontains a faded Last Supper, by _Baroccio_.\r\n\r\n     \"The Cenacolo of Baroccio, painted by order of Clement VIII.\r\n     (1594), is remarkable for an anecdote relating to it. Baroccio, who\r\n     was not eminent for a correct taste, had in his first sketch\r\n     reverted to the ancient fashion of placing Satan close behind\r\n     Judas, whispering in his ear, and tempting him to betray his\r\n     master. The pope expressed his dissatisfaction,--'che non gli\r\n     piaceva il demonio se dimesticasse tanto con Gesù Christo,'--and\r\n     ordered him to remove the offensive figure.\"--_Jameson's Sacred\r\n     Art_, p. 277.\r\n\r\nHere are the fine tombs erected by Clement VIII. (Ippolito Aldobrandini)\r\nas soon as he obtained the papacy, to his father and mother. Their\r\narchitecture is by _Giacomo della Porta_, but the figures are by\r\n_Cordieri_, the sculptor of Sta. Silvia's statue. At the sides of the\r\nmother's tomb are figures emblematical of Charity, by that of the\r\nfather, figures of Humility and Vanity. Beyond his mother's tomb is a\r\nfine statue of Clement VIII. himself (who is buried at Sta. Maria\r\nMaggiore), by _Ippolito Buzi_.\r\n\r\n     \"Hippolyte Aldobrandini, qui prit le nom de Clément VIII., était le\r\n     cinquième fils du célèbre jurisconsulte Silvestro Aldobrandini,\r\n     qui, après avoir professé à Pise et joui d'une haute autorité à\r\n     Florence, avait été condamné à l'exil par le retour au pouvoir des\r\n     Médicis ses ennemis. La vie de Silvestre devint alors pénible et\r\n     calamiteuse. Dépouillé de ses biens, il fut, du moins, toujours\r\n     ennoblir son malheur par la dignité de son caractère. Sa famille\r\n     présentait un rare assemblage de douces vertus et de jeunes talents\r\n     qu'une forte éducation développait chaque jour avec puissance.\r\n     Appelé à Rome par Paul III., qui le nomma avocat consistorial,\r\n     Silvester s'y transporta avec son épouse, la pieuse Leta Deti, qui,\r\n     pendant trente-sept ans, fut pour lui comme son bon ange, et avec\r\n     tous ses enfants, Jean, qui devait être un jour cardinal; Bernard,\r\n     qui devint un vaillant guerrier; Thomas, qui préparait déjà\r\n     peut-être sa traduction de Diogène-Laërce; Pierre, qui voulut être\r\n     jurisconsulte comme son père; et le jeune Hippolyte, un enfant\r\n     alors, dont les saillies inquiétaient le vieillard, car il ne\r\n     savait comment pourvoir à son éducation et utiliser cette vivacité\r\n     de génie qui déjà brillait dans son regard. Hippolyte fut élevé\r\n     aux frais du cardinal Farnèse; puis, tous les emplois, toutes les\r\n     dignités vinrent successivement au-devant de lui, sans qu'il les\r\n     cherchât autrement qu'en s'en rendant digne.\"--_Gournerie, Rome\r\n     Chrétienne_, ii. 238.\r\n\r\nThe sixth chapel contains two fine cinque-cento tombs; on the left,\r\nBenedetto Superanzio, bishop of Nicosa, ob. 1495; on the right, a\r\nSpanish bishop, Giovanni da Coca, with frescoes. Close to the former\r\ntomb, on the floor, is the grave of (archdeacon) Robert Wilberforce, who\r\ndied at Albano in 1857.\r\n\r\nHere we enter the right transept. On the right is a small dark chapel\r\ncontaining a fine Crucifix, attributed to Giotto. The central, or\r\nCaraffa Chapel, is dedicated to St. Thomas Aquinas, and is covered with\r\nwell-preserved frescoes. On the right, St. Thomas Aquinas is represented\r\nsurrounded by allegorical figures, by _Filippino Lippi_. Over the altar\r\nis a beautiful Annunciation, in which a portrait of the donor, Cardinal\r\nOlivieri Caraffa, is introduced. Above is the Assumption of the Virgin.\r\nOn the ceiling are the four Sibyls, by _Raffaelino del Garbo_.\r\n\r\nAgainst the left wall is the tomb of Paul IV., Gio. Pietro Caraffa\r\n(1555--59), the great supporter of the Inquisition, the patron of the\r\nJesuits, the persecutor of the Jews (whom he shut up with walls in the\r\nGhetto),--a pope so terrible to look upon, that even Alva, who feared no\r\nman, trembled at his awful aspect Such he is represented upon his tomb,\r\nwith deeply-sunken eyes and strongly-marked features, with one hand\r\nraised in blessing--or cursing, and the keys of St. Peter in the other.\r\nThe tomb was designed by Pirro Ligorio; the statue is the work of\r\nGiacomo and Tommaso Casignuola, and being made in marble of different\r\npieces and colours, is cited by Vasari as an instance of a sculptor's\r\ningenuity in imitating painting with his materials. The epitaph runs:\r\n\r\n     \"To Jesus Christ, the hope and the life of the faithful; to Paul\r\n     IV. Caraffa, sovereign pontiff, distinguished amongst all by his\r\n     eloquence, his learning, and his wisdom; illustrious by his\r\n     innocence, by his liberality, and by his greatness of soul; to the\r\n     most ardent champion of the catholic faith, Pius V., sovereign\r\n     pontiff, has raised this monument of his gratitude and of his\r\n     piety. He lived eighty-three years, one month, and twenty days, and\r\n     died the 14th August, 1559, the fifth year of his\r\n     pontificate.\"[312]\r\n\r\nOn the transept wall, just outside this chapel, is the beautiful gothic\r\ntomb of Guillaume Durandus, bishop of Mende,[313] with a recumbent\r\nfigure guarded by two angels, the background being occupied by a mosaic\r\nof the Virgin and Child, by _Giovanni Cosmati_.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel on a line with the choir--the burial-place of the\r\nAltieri family--has an altar-piece, by _Carlo Maratta_, representing\r\nfive saints canonized by Clement X., presented to the Virgin by St.\r\nPeter. On the floor is the incised monument of a bishop of Sutri.\r\n\r\nThe second chapel--which contains a fine cinque-cento tomb--is that of\r\nthe Rosary. Its ceiling, representing the Mysteries of the Rosary, is by\r\n_Marcello Venusti_; the history of St. Catherine of Siena is by\r\n_Giovanni de' Vecchi_; the large and beautiful Madonna with the Child\r\nover the altar is attributed to _Fra Angelico_. Here is the tomb of\r\nCardinal Capranica of 1470.\r\n\r\nBeneath the high altar, with lamps always burning before it, is a marble\r\nsarcophagus with a beautiful figure, enclosing the body of St.\r\nCatherine of Siena. In it her relics were deposited in 1461, by\r\nAntoninus, archbishop of Florence. On the last pillar to the right is an\r\ninscription stating that, \"all the indulgences and privileges in every\r\nchurch, of all the religious orders, mendicant or not mendicant, in\r\nevery part of the world, are granted especially to this church, where is\r\nthe body of St. Catherine of Siena.\"\r\n\r\n     \"St. Catherine was one of twenty-five children born in wedlock to\r\n     Jacopo and Lupa Benincasa, citizens of Siena. Her father exercised\r\n     the trade of dyer and fuller. In the year of her birth, 1347, Siena\r\n     reached the climax of its power and splendour. It was then that the\r\n     plague of Bocaccio began to rage, which swept off 80,000 citizens,\r\n     and interrupted the building of the great Duomo. In the midst of so\r\n     large a family and during these troubled times, Catherine grew\r\n     almost unnoticed, but it was not long before she manifested her\r\n     peculiar disposition. At six years old she already saw visions and\r\n     longed for a monastic life: about the same time she used to collect\r\n     her childish companions together and preach to them. As she grew\r\n     her wishes became stronger; she refused the proposals which her\r\n     parents made that she should marry, and so vexed them by her\r\n     obstinacy that they imposed on her the most servile duties in their\r\n     household. These she patiently fulfilled, at the same time pursuing\r\n     her own vocation with unwearied ardour. She scarcely slept at all,\r\n     and ate no food but vegetables and a little bread, scourged\r\n     herself, wore sackcloth, and became emaciated, weak, and half\r\n     delirious. At length the firmness of her character and the force of\r\n     her hallucination won the day. Her parents consented to her\r\n     assuming the Dominican robe, and at the age of thirteen she entered\r\n     the monastic life. From this moment till her death we see in her\r\n     the ecstatic, the philanthropist, and the politician combined to a\r\n     remarkable degree. For three whole years she never left her cell\r\n     except to go to church, maintaining an almost unbroken silence.\r\n     Yet, when she returned to the world, convinced at length of having\r\n     won by prayer and pain the favour of her Lord, it was to preach to\r\n     infuriated mobs, to toil among men dying of the plague, to execute\r\n     diplomatic negotiations, to harangue the republic of Florence, to\r\n     correspond with queens, and to interpose between kings and popes.\r\n     In the midst of this varied and distracting career she continued to\r\n     see visions, and to fast and scourge herself. The domestic virtues\r\n     and the personal wants and wishes of a woman were annihilated in\r\n     her; she lived for the Church, for the poor, and for Christ, whom\r\n     she imagined to be constantly supporting her. At length she died\r\n     (at Rome, on the 29th of April, 1380, in her 33rd year) worn out by\r\n     inward conflicts, by the tension of a half-delirious ecstasy, by\r\n     want of food and sleep, and by the excitement of political\r\n     life.\"--_Cornhill Mag._ Sept. 1866.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the high altar is a statue of St. John, by _Obicci_,--on\r\nthe left is the famous statue of Christ, by _Michael Angelo_. This is\r\none of the sculptures which Francis I. tried hard to obtain for Paris.\r\nIts effect is marred by the bronze drapery.\r\n\r\nBehind, in the choir, are the tombs of two Medici popes. On the left is\r\nLeo X., Giovanni de Medici (1513--21). This great pope, son of Lorenzo\r\nthe Magnificent, was destined to the papacy from his cradle. He was\r\nordained at seven years old, was made a cardinal at seventeen, and pope\r\nat thirty-eight, and at the installation procession to the Lateran, rode\r\nupon the same white horse, upon which he had fought and had been taken\r\nprisoner at the battle of Ravenna. His reign was one of fêtes and\r\npleasures. He was the great patron of artists and poets, and Raphael and\r\nAriosto rose into eminence under his protection. His tomb is from a\r\ndesign of Antonio di Sangallo, but the figure of the pope is by\r\nRaffaello da Montelupo.\r\n\r\nNear the foot of Leo X.'s tomb is the flat monumental stone of Cardinal\r\nBembo, his friend, and the friend of Raphael, who died 1547. His epitaph\r\nhas been changed. The original inscription, half-pagan, half-Christian,\r\nran:\r\n\r\n    \"Hic Bembus jacet Aonidum laus maxima Phœbi\r\n      Cum sole, et luna vix periturus honos.\r\n    Hic et fama jacet, spes, et suprema galeri\r\n      Quam non ulla queat restituisse dies.\r\n    Hic jacet exemplar vitæ omni fraude carentis,\r\n      Summa jacet, summa hic cum pietate fides.\"\r\n\r\nOn the right of the choir is the tomb, by Sangallo, of Clement VII.,\r\nGiulio de Medici (1523--34), son of the Giulio who fell in the\r\nconspiracy of the Pazzi,--who in his unhappy reign saw the sack of Rome\r\n(1527) under the Constable de Bourbon, and the beginning of the\r\nseparation from England under Henry VIII. The figure of the pope is by\r\n_Baccio Bandinelli_. Among other graves here is that of the English\r\nCardinal Howard, ob. 1694. Just beyond the choir is a passage leading to\r\na door into the Via S. Ignazio. Immediately on the left is the slab tomb\r\nof Fra Angelico da Fiesole. It is inscribed:\r\n\r\n    \"Hic jacet Vene Pictor Fl. Jo. de Florentia Ordinis\r\n               prædicatorum, 1404.\r\n\r\n    \"Non mihi sit laudi quod eram velut alter Apelles,\r\n      Sed quod lucra tuis omnia, Christe, dabam.\r\n    Altera nam terris opera exstant, altero cœlo.\r\n      Urbs me Johannem flos tulit Etruriæ.\"[314]\r\n\r\n     \"Fra Angelico was simple and most holy in his manners,--and let\r\n     this serve for a token of his simplicity, that Pope Nicholas one\r\n     morning offering him refreshment, he scrupled to eat flesh without\r\n     the licence of his superior, forgetful for the moment of the\r\n     dispensing authority of the pontiff. He shunned altogether the\r\n     commerce of the world, and living in holiness and in purity, was as\r\n     loving towards the poor on earth as I think his soul must be now in\r\n     heaven. He worked incessantly at his art, nor would he ever paint\r\n     other than sacred subjects. He might have been rich, but cared not\r\n     to be so, saying that true riches consisted rather in being content\r\n     with little. He might have ruled over many, but willed it not,\r\n     saying there was less trouble and hazard of sin in obeying others.\r\n     Dignity and authority were within his grasp, but he disregarded\r\n     them, affirming that he sought no other advancement than to escape\r\n     hell and draw nigh to Paradise. He was most meek and temperate, and\r\n     by a chaste life loosened himself from the snares of the world,\r\n     ofttimes saying that the student of painting hath need of quiet and\r\n     to live without anxiety, and that the dealers in the things of\r\n     Christ ought to live habitually with Christ. Never was he seen in\r\n     anger with the brethren, which appears to me a thing most\r\n     marvellous, and all but incredible; his admonitions to his friends\r\n     were simple and always softened by a smile. Whoever sought to\r\n     employ him, he answered with the utmost courtesy, that he would do\r\n     his part willingly so the prior were content.--In sum, this never\r\n     sufficiently to be lauded father was most humble and modest in all\r\n     his words and deeds, and in his paintings graceful and devout; and\r\n     the saints which he painted have more of the air and aspect of\r\n     saints than those of any other artist. He was wont never to retouch\r\n     or amend any of his paintings, but left them always as they had\r\n     come from his hand at first, believing, as he said, that such was\r\n     the will of God. Some say that he never took up his pencil without\r\n     previous prayer. He never painted a crucifix without tears bathing\r\n     his cheeks; and throughout his works, in the countenance and\r\n     attitude of all his figures, the correspondent impress of his\r\n     sincere and exalted appreciation of the Christian religion is\r\n     recognisable. Such was this verily Angelic father, who spent the\r\n     whole time of his life in the service of God and in doing good to\r\n     the world and to his neighbour. And truly a gift like his could not\r\n     descend on any but a man of most saintly life, for a painter must\r\n     be holy himself before he can depict holiness.\"--_Lord Lindsay,\r\n     from Vasari._\r\n\r\nIn the same passage are tombs of Cardinal Alessandrino, by Giacomo della\r\nPorta; of Cardinal Pimentel, by Bernini; and of Cardinal Bonelli, by\r\nCarlo Rainaldi.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, in the left transept, is the Chapel of S. Domenico, with\r\neight black columns, appropriate to the colour of the Order, and an\r\ninteresting picture of the saint. Here is the tomb of Benedict XIII.,\r\nVincenzo-Maria Orsini (1724--30), by Pietro Bracci. This pope, who had\r\nbeen a Dominican monk, laboured hard in his short reign for the\r\nreformation of the Church, and the morals of the clergy.\r\n\r\nOver a door leading to the Sacristy are frescoes representing the\r\nelection of Eugenius IV. in 1431, and of Nicholas V. in 1447, which both\r\ntook place in this church. The altar of the sacristy has a Crucifixion,\r\nby Andrea Sacchi.\r\n\r\nReturning down the left aisle, the second chapel, counting from this\r\nend, is that of the Lante family, which contains the fine tomb of the\r\nDuchess Lante, ob. 1840, by _Tenerani_, with the Angel of the\r\nResurrection, a sublime upward-gazing figure seated upon the\r\nsarcophagus. Here is a picture of St. James, by _Baroccio_.\r\n\r\nThe third chapel is that of S. Vincenzo Ferreri, apostle of the Order of\r\nPreachers, with a miracle-working picture, by _Bernardo Castelli_. The\r\nfourth chapel--of the Grazioli family--has on the right a statue of St.\r\nSebastian, by _Mino da Fiesole_, and over the altar a lovely head of our\r\nSaviour, by _Perugino_. This chapel was purchased by the Grazioli from\r\nthe old family of Maffei, of which there are some fine tombs. The fifth\r\nchapel--of the Patrizi family--contains the famous miraculous picture\r\ncalled \"La Madonna Consolatrice degli afflitti,\" in honour of which Pope\r\nGregory XVI. conceded so many indulgences, as we read by the\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\n     \"La santità di N. S. Gregorio Papa XVI. con breve in data 17 Sept.\r\n     1836. Ho accordato l'indulgenzia plenaria a chiunque confessato e\r\n     communicato visiterà divotamente questa santa imagine della B.\r\n     Vergine sotto il titolo di consolatrice degli afflitti nella\r\n     seconda dominica di Luglio e suo ottavo di ciascun anno: concede\r\n     altresi la parziale indulgenza di 200 giorni in qualunque giorno\r\n     dell' anno a chiunque almeno contrito visiterà la detta S.\r\n     Immagine: le dette indulgenze poi sono pure applicabili alle\r\n     benedette anime del purgatorio.\"\r\n\r\nThe last chapel, belonging to a Spanish nobleman, contains the picture\r\nof the Crucifixion, which is said to have conversed with Sta. Rosa di\r\nLima.\r\n\r\nNear the entrance is the tomb of Cardinal Giacomo Tebaldi, ob. 1466, and\r\nbeneath it that of Francesco Tornabuoni, by _Mino da Fiesole_. It was\r\nfor the tomb of the wife of this Tornabuoni, who died in childbirth,\r\nthat the wonderful relief of Verocchio, now in the Uffizi at Florence,\r\nwas executed. In the pavement is the gravestone of Paulus Manutius, the\r\nprinter, son of the famous Aldus Manutius of Venice, with the\r\ninscription, \"Paulo Manutio Aldi Filio. Obiit CIƆIƆLXXIV.\"\r\n\r\nThe great _Dominican Convent of the Minerva_, lately suppressed, was the\r\nresidence of the General of the Order. It contains the _Bibliotheca\r\nCasanatensis_ (so called from its founder, Cardinal Casanata), the\r\nlargest library in Rome after that of the Vatican, comprising 120,000\r\nprinted volumes and 4500 MSS. It is open from 8 to 11 A.M., and 1½ to\r\n3½ P.M. This convent has always been connected with the history of\r\nthe Inquisition. Here, on June 22, 1633, Galileo was tried before its\r\ntribunal for the \"heresy\" of saying that the earth went round the sun,\r\ninstead of the sun round the earth, and was forced to recant upon his\r\nknees, this \"accursed, heretical, and detestable doctrine.\" As he rose\r\nfrom his humiliation, he is said to have consoled himself by adding, in\r\nan undertone, \"E pur si muove.\" When the \"Palace of the Holy Office\" was\r\nstormed by the mob in the revolution of 1848, it was feared that the\r\nDominican convent would have been burnt down.\r\n\r\nThe very beautiful cloister of the convent, which has a vaulted roof\r\nrichly painted in arabesques, contains grand fifteenth century\r\ntombs,--of Cardinal Tiraso, ob. 1502, and of Cardinal Astorgius, ob.\r\n1503. S. Antonino, archbishop of Florence, who lived in the reigns of\r\nEugenius IV. and Nicholas V., was prior of this convent.\r\n\r\nFrom the Minerva, the _Via del Piè di Marmo_, so called from a gigantic\r\nmarble foot which stands on one side of it, leads to the Corso.[315]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE BORGO AND ST. PETER'S.\r\n\r\n     Via Tordinona--S. Salvatore in Lauro--House of Raphael--S. Giovanni\r\n     de' Fiorentini--Bridge and Castle of S. Angelo--Sta. Maria\r\n     Traspontina--Palazzo Giraud--Piazza Scossa-Cavalli--Hospital of\r\n     Santo Spirito--Piazza and Obelisk of the Vatican--S. Peter's; its\r\n     portico, tombs, crypts, dome, and sacristy--Churches of S. Stefano\r\n     and Sta. Marta--Il Cimeterio dei Tedeschi--Palazzo del\r\n     Santo-Uffizio--S. Salvatore in Torrione--S. Michaele in Sassia.\r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing in a direct course from the Piazza Borghese, we pass through\r\na series of narrow dirty streets quite devoid of interest, but bordering\r\non one side upon the Tiber, of which--with its bridge, S. Angelo and St.\r\nPeter's--beautiful views may be obtained from little courts and narrow\r\nstrips of shore, at the back of the houses.\r\n\r\nA short distance after passing (on left) the Locanda dell' Orso, where\r\nMontaigne used to stay when he was in Rome, and beneath which are some\r\ncurious vaulted chambers of _c._ A.D. 1500, the street, which repeatedly\r\nchanges its name, is called _Via Tordinona_, from the Tor di Nona, which\r\nonce stood here, but was destroyed in 1690. It was used as a prison, as\r\nis shown by the verse of Regnier:\r\n\r\n    \"Qu'un barisel vous mit dedans la tour de Nonne.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the narrow streets on the left of the Via Tordinona debouches\r\ninto the Via dei Coronari, close to the _Church of S. Salvatore in\r\nLauro_, built on the site of a laurel-grove, which flourished near the\r\nportico of Europa. It contains a picture of the Nativity, by _Pietro da\r\nCortona_, and a modern work of _Gagliardi_, representing S. Emidio, S.\r\nNicolo da Tolentino, and S. Giacomo della Marina, the three protectors\r\nof Ancona. In a side chapel, opening out of the cloisters, is the rich\r\ntomb of Pope Eugenius IV. (Gabriele Condolmieri, ob. 1439), with his\r\nrecumbent figure by Isaia da Pisa. Francesco Salviati painted a portrait\r\nof this pope for the adjoining convent, to which he had belonged, as\r\nwell as a fine fresco of the Marriage of Cana.[316]\r\n\r\n(There are several other fine monuments in the same chapel with the\r\ntomb, which in 1867 was given up as a barrack to the Flemish zouaves, at\r\nthe great risk of injury to its delicate carvings.)\r\n\r\nPassing the _Apollo Theatre_, the Via Tordinona emerges upon the quay of\r\nthe Tiber, opposite S. Angelo. Hence several streets diverge into the\r\nheart of the city.\r\n\r\n(At the corner of the Via di Banchi is a house with a frieze, richly\r\nsculptured with lions' heads, &c. On the left is the _Church of San\r\nCelso in Banchi_, in front of which Lorenzo Colonna, the protonotary,\r\nwas murdered by the Orsini and Santa Croce, immediately after the death\r\nof Sixtus IV. (1484); and where his mother, finding his head cut off,\r\nand seizing it by the hair, shrieked forth her curses upon his enemies.\r\nOn the right, further down the street, is the _Church of Sta. Caterina\r\nda Siena_, which contains an interesting altar-piece by _Girolamo\r\nGenga_, representing the return of Gregory XI. from Avignon, which was\r\ndue to her influence.)\r\n\r\nThe house joining the Ponte S. Angelo is said to have been that of the\r\n\"Violinista,\" the friend of Raphael, who is familiar to us from his\r\nportrait in the Sciarra Palace. Some say that Raphael died while he was\r\non a visit to him. But the best authorities maintain that he died in a\r\nhouse built for him by Bramante, in the Piazza Rusticucci, which was\r\npulled down to enlarge the Piazza of St. Peter's. No. 124, Via Coronari,\r\nnot far from the Ponte S. Angelo, is shown as the house in which the\r\ngreat painter lived previously to this, and is that which he bequeathed\r\nto the chapel in the Pantheon in which he is buried. It was partly\r\nrebuilt in 1705, when Carlo Maderno painted on its façade a portrait of\r\nRaphael in _chiaro-scuro_, now almost obliterated. The house at present\r\nbelongs to the canons of Sta. Maria Maggiore.\r\n\r\n(The Via _S. Giovanni de' Fiorentini_ leads to the _Church_ of that\r\nname, abutting picturesquely into the angle of the Tiber. This is the\r\nnational church of the Tuscans, and was built at the expense of the city\r\nof Florence. In the tribune are tombs of the Falconieri family. Here are\r\nseveral fine pictures; a St. Jerome writing, by _Cigoli_, who is buried\r\nin this church; St. Jerome praying before a crucifix, _Tito Santi_[317]\r\n(1538--1603); St. Francis, _Tito Santi_; SS. Cosmo and Damian condemned\r\nto martyrdom by fire,--a grand work of _Salvator Rosa_.\r\n\r\n     \"Some of the altar-pieces of Salvator-Rosa (1615-1673), are well\r\n     conceived and full of effect, especially when they represent a\r\n     horrible subject, like the martyrdom in S. Giovanni de'\r\n     Fiorentini.\"--Lanzi, ii. 165.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel of the Crucifix is painted by _Lanfranco_: the third chapel\r\non the right has frescoes by _Tempesta_ on the roof, relating to the\r\nhistory of S. Lorenzo.\r\n\r\nThe building of this church was begun in the reign of Leo X. by\r\nSansovino, who, for want of space, laid its foundations, at enormous\r\nexpense, in the bed of the Tiber. While overlooking this, he fell from a\r\nscaffold, and being dangerously hurt, was obliged to give up his place\r\nto Antonio da Sangallo.[318] Soon after Pope Leo died, and the work,\r\nwith many others, was suspended during the reign of Adrian VI. Under\r\nClement VII. Sansovino returned, but was driven away, robbed of all his\r\npossessions in the sack of Rome, under the Constable de Bourbon. The\r\nchurch was finished by Giacomo della Porta in 1588, but Alessandro\r\nGalileo added the façade in 1725.\r\n\r\n     \"En 1488, une affreuse épidémie décimait les malheureux habitants\r\n     des environs de Rome; les mourants étaient abandonnés, les cadavres\r\n     restaient sans sépulture. Aussitôt quelques Florentins forment une\r\n     confrérie sous le titre de _la Pitié_, pour rendre aux pestiférés\r\n     les derniers devoirs de la charité chrétienne: c'est à cette\r\n     confrérie qu'on doit la belle église de Saint-Jean des Florentins,\r\n     à Strada Giulia.\"--_Gournerie, Rome Chrétienne._\r\n\r\nThe _Ponte S. Angelo_ is the Pons Elius of Hadrian, built as an approach\r\nto his mausoleum, and only intended for this, as another public bridge\r\nexisted close by, at the time of its construction. It is almost entirely\r\nancient, except the parapets. The statues of St. Peter and St. Paul, at\r\nthe extremity, were erected by Clement VII., in the place of two\r\nchapels, in 1530, and the angels, by Clement IX., in 1688. The pedestal\r\nof the third angel on the right is a relic of the siege of Rome in 1849,\r\nand bears the impress of a cannon-ball.\r\n\r\nThese angels, which have been called the \"breezy maniacs\" of Bernini,\r\nare only from his designs. The two angels which he executed himself, and\r\nintended for this bridge, are now at S. Andrea delle Fratte. The idea of\r\nClement IX. was a fine one, that \"an avenue of the heavenly host should\r\nbe assembled to welcome the pilgrim to the shrine of the great apostle.\"\r\n\r\nDante saw the bridge of S. Angelo divided lengthways by barriers to\r\nfacilitate the movement of the crowds going to and from St Peter's on\r\nthe occasion of the first jubilee, 1300.\r\n\r\n      \"Come i Romani per l'esercito molto,\r\n    L'anno del giubbileo, su per lo ponte\r\n    Hanno a passar la gente modo tolto;\r\n      Che dall' un lato tutti hanno la fronte\r\n    Verso 'l castello, e vanno a Santo Pietro,\r\n    Dall' altra sponda vanno verso 'l monte.\"\r\n\r\n    _Inferno_, xviii. 29.\r\n\r\nFrom the Ponte S. Angelo, when the Tiber is low, are visible the remains\r\nof the bridge by which the ancient _Via Triumphalis_ crossed the river.\r\nClose by, where Santo Spirito now stands, was the Porta Triumphalis, by\r\nwhich victors entered the city in triumph.\r\n\r\nFacing the bridge, is the famous _Castle of S. Angelo_, built by the\r\nEmperor Hadrian as his family tomb, because the last niche in the\r\nimperial mausoleum of Augustus was filled when the ashes of Nerva were\r\nlaid there. The first funeral here was that of Elius Verus, the first\r\nadopted son of Hadrian, who died before him. The emperor himself died at\r\nBaiæ, but his remains were transported hither from a temporary tomb at\r\nPozzuoli by his successor Antoninus Pius, by whom the mausoleum was\r\ncompleted in A.D. 140. Here, also, were buried, Antoninus Pius, A.D.\r\n161; Marcus Aurelius, 180; Commodus, 192; and Septimius Severus, in an\r\nurn of gold, enclosed in one of alabaster, A.D. 211; Caracalla, in 217,\r\nwas the last emperor interred here. The well-known lines of Byron:\r\n\r\n    \"Turn to the mole which Hadrian rear'd on high,\r\n    Imperial mimic of old Egypt's piles,\r\n    Colossal copyist of deformity,\r\n    Whose travell'd phantasy from the far Nile's\r\n    Enormous model, doom'd the artist's toils\r\n    To build for giants, and for his vain earth,\r\n    His shrunken ashes, raise this dome! How smiles\r\n    The gazer's eye with philosophic mirth,\r\n    To view the huge design which sprung from such a birth.\"\r\n\r\nseem rather applicable to the _Pyramid_ of Caius Cestius than to this\r\nmausoleum.\r\n\r\nThe castle, as it now appears, is but the skeleton of the magnificent\r\ntomb of the emperors. Procopius, writing in the sixth century, describes\r\nits appearance in his time. \"It is built,\" he says, \"of Parian marble;\r\nthe square blocks fit closely to each other without any cement. It has\r\nfour equal sides, each a stone's throw in length. In height it rises\r\nabove the walls of the city. On the summit are statues of men and\r\nhorses, of admirable workmanship, in Parian marble.\" Canina, in his\r\n\"Architectura Romana,\" gives a restoration of the mausoleum, which shows\r\nhow it consisted of three storeys: 1, a quadrangular basement, the upper\r\npart intersected with Doric pillars, between which were spaces for\r\nepitaphs of the dead within, and surmounted at the corners by marble\r\nequestrian statues; 2, a circular storey, with fluted Ionic colonnades:\r\n3, a circular storey, surrounded by Corinthian columns, between which\r\nwere statues. The whole was surmounted by a pyramidal roof, ending in a\r\nbronze fir-cone.\r\n\r\n     \"The mausoleum which Hadrian erected for himself on the further\r\n     bank of the Tiber far outshone the tomb of Augustus, which it\r\n     nearly confronted. Of the size and dignity which characterized this\r\n     work of Egyptian massiveness, we may gain a conception from the\r\n     existing remains; but it requires an effort of imagination to\r\n     transform the scarred and shapeless bulk before us, into the\r\n     graceful pile which rose column upon column, surmounted by a gilded\r\n     dome of span almost unrivalled.\" _Merivale_, ch. lxvi.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Mausoleum, in the middle ages, is almost the history\r\nof Rome. It was probably first turned into a fortress by Honorius, A.D.\r\n423. From Theodoric it derives the name of \"Carcer Theodorici.\" In 537,\r\nit was besieged by Vitiges, when the defending garrison, reduced to the\r\nlast extremity, hurled down all the magnificent statues which decorated\r\nthe cornice, upon the besiegers. In A.D. 498 Pope Symmachus removed the\r\nbronze fir-cone at the apex of the roof to the court of St. Peter's,\r\nwhence it was afterwards transferred to the Vatican garden, where it is\r\nstill to be seen between two bronze peacocks, which probably stood on\r\neither side of the entrance.\r\n\r\nBelisarius defended the castle against Totila, whose Gothic troops\r\ncaptured and held it for three years, after which it was taken by\r\nNarses.\r\n\r\nIt was in 530 that the event occurred which gave the building its\r\npresent name. Pope Gregory the Great was leading a penitential\r\nprocession to St. Peter's, in order to offer up prayers for the staying\r\nof the great pestilence which followed the inundation of 589; when, as\r\nhe was crossing the bridge, even while the people were falling dead\r\naround him, he looked up at the mausoleum, and saw an angel on its\r\nsummit, sheathing a bloody sword,[319] while a choir of angels around\r\nchaunted with celestial voices, the anthem, since adopted by the Church\r\nin her vesper service--\"_Regina cœli, lætare--quia quem meruisti\r\nportare--resurrexit, sicut dixit, Alleluja_\"--To which the earthly voice\r\nof the pope solemnly responded, \"_Ora pro nobis Deum, Alleluja_.\"[320]\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century the fortress was occupied by the infamous Marozia,\r\nwho, in turn, brought her three husbands (Alberic, Count of Tusculum;\r\nGuido, Marquis of Tuscany; and Hugo, King of Italy) thither, to\r\ntyrannise with her over Rome. It was within the walls of this building\r\nthat Alberic, her son by her first husband, waiting upon his royal\r\nstepfather at table, threw a bowl of water over him, when Hugo retorted\r\nby a blow, which was the signal for an insurrection, the people taking\r\npart with Alberic, putting the king to flight, and imprisoning Marozia.\r\nShut up within these walls, Pope John XI. (931-936), son of Marozia by\r\nher first husband, ruled under the guidance of his stronger-minded\r\nbrother Alberic; here, also, Octavian, son of Alberic, and grandson of\r\nMarozia, succeeded in forcing his election as John XII. (being the\r\nfirst pope who took a new name), and scandalised Christendom by a life\r\nof murder, robbery, adultery, and incest.\r\n\r\nIn 974 the castle was seized by Cencio (Crescenzio Nomentano), the\r\nconsul, who raised up an anti-pope (Boniface VII.) here, with the\r\ndetermination of destroying the temporal power of the popes, and\r\nimprisoned and murdered two popes, Benedict VI. (972), and John XIV.\r\n(984), within these walls. In 996 another lawful pope, Gregory V.,\r\ncalling in the emperor Otho to his assistance, took the castle, and\r\nbeheaded Cencio, though he had promised him life if he would surrender.\r\nFrom this governor the fortress long held the name of Castello de\r\nCrescenzio, or Turris Crescentii, by which it is described in mediæval\r\nwritings. A second Cencio supported another anti-pope, Cadolaus, here in\r\n1063, against Pope Alexander II. A third Cencio imprisoned Gregory VII.\r\nhere in 1084. From this time the possession of the castle was a constant\r\npoint of contest between popes and anti-popes. In 1313 Arlotto degli\r\nStefaneschi, having demolished most of the other towers in the city,\r\narranged the same fate for S. Angelo, but it was saved by cession to the\r\nOrsini. It was from hence, on December 15, 1347, that Rienzi fled to\r\nBohemia, at the end of his first period of power, his wife having\r\npreviously made her escape disguised as a friar.\r\n\r\n\"The cause of final ruin to this monument\" is described by Nibby to have\r\nbeen the resentment of the citizens against a French governor who\r\nespoused the cause of the anti-pope (Clement VII.) against Urban VI. in\r\n1378. It was then that the marble casings were all torn from the walls\r\nand used as street pavements.\r\n\r\nA drawing of Sangallo of 1465 shows the \"upper part of the fortress\r\ncrowned with high square towers and turreted buildings; a cincture of\r\nbastions and massive square towers girding the whole; two square-built\r\nbulwarks flanking the extremity of the bridge, which was then so\r\nconnected with these outworks that passengers would have immediately\r\nfound themselves inside the fortress after crossing the river.\r\nMarlianus, 1588, describes its double cincture of fortifications--a\r\nlarge round tower at the inner extremity of the bridge; two towers with\r\nhigh pinnacles, and the cross on their summits, the river flowing all\r\naround.\"[321]\r\n\r\nThe castle began to assume its present aspect under Boniface IX. in\r\n1395. John XXIII., 1411, commenced the covered way to the Vatican, which\r\nwas finished by Alexander VI.; and roofed by Urban VIII., in 1630. By\r\nthe last-named pope the great outworks of the fortress were built under\r\nBernini, and furnished with cannon made from the bronze roof of the\r\nPantheon. Under Paul III. the interior was decorated with frescoes, and\r\na colossal marble angel erected on the summit, in the place of a chapel\r\n(S. Angelo inter Nubes), built by Boniface IV. The marble angel was\r\nexchanged by Benedict XIV. for the existing angel of bronze, by a Dutch\r\nartist, Verschaffelt.\r\n\r\n     \"Paul III. voulant justifier le nom donné à cette forteresse, fit\r\n     placer au sommet de l'édifice une statue de marbre, représentant un\r\n     ange tenant à la main une épée nue. Cet ouvrage de Raphaël de\r\n     Montelupo a été remplacé, du temps de Benoit XIV., par une statue\r\n     de bronze qui fournit cette belle réponse à un officier français\r\n     assiégé dans le fort. 'Je me rendrai quand l'ange remettra son épée\r\n     dans le fourreau.'\r\n\r\n     \" ... Cet ange a l'air naïf d'une jeune fille de dix-huit ans, et\r\n     ne cherche qu'à bien remettre son épée dans le\r\n     fourreau.\"--_Stendhal_, i. 33.\r\n\r\n     \"I suppose no one ever looked at this statue critically--at least,\r\n     for myself, I never could; nor can I remember now whether, as a\r\n     work of art, it is above or below criticism; perhaps both. With its\r\n     vast wings, poised in air, as seen against the deep blue skies of\r\n     Rome, or lighted up by the golden sunset, to me it was ever like\r\n     what it was intended to represent--like a vision.\"--_Jameson's\r\n     Sacred Art_, p. 98.\r\n\r\nOf the castle, as we now see it externally, only the quadrangular\r\nbasement is of the time of Hadrian; the round tower is of that of Urban\r\nVIII., its top added by Paul III. The four round towers of the outworks,\r\ncalled after the four Evangelists, are of Nicholas V., 1447.\r\n\r\nThe _interior_ of the fortress can be visited by an order. Excavations\r\nmade in 1825 have laid open the sepulchral chamber in the midst of the\r\nbasement. Here stood, in the centre, the porphyry sarcophagus of\r\nHadrian, which was stolen by Pope Innocent II. to be used as his own\r\ntomb in the Lateran, where it was destroyed by the fire of 1360, the\r\ncover alone escaping, which was used for the tomb of Otho II., in the\r\natrium of St. Peter's, and which, after filling this office for seven\r\ncenturies, is now the baptismal font of that basilica. A spiral passage,\r\nthirty feet high, and eleven wide, up which a chariot could be driven,\r\ngradually ascends through the solid mass of masonry. There is\r\nwonderfully little to be seen. A saloon of the time of Paul III. is\r\nadorned with frescoes of the life of Alexander the Great, by _Pierino\r\ndel Vaga_. This room would be used by the pope in case of his having to\r\ntake refuge in S. Angelo. An adjoining room, adorned with a stucco\r\nfrieze of Tritons and Nereids, is that in which Cardinal Caraffa was\r\nstrangled (1561) under Pius IV., for alleged abuses of authority under\r\nhis uncle, Paul IV.--his brother, the Marquis Caraffa, being beheaded in\r\nthe castle the same night. The reputed prison of Beatrice Cenci is\r\nshown, but it is very uncertain that she was ever confined here,--also\r\nthe prison of Cagliostro, and that of Benvenuto Cellini, who escaped,\r\nand broke his leg in trying to let himself down by a rope from the\r\nramparts. The statue of the angel by _Montelupo_ is to be seen stowed\r\naway in a dark corner. Several horrible _trabocchette_ (oubliettes) are\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nOn the roof, from which there is a beautiful view, are many modern\r\nprisons, where prisoners suffer terribly from the summer sun beating\r\nupon their flat roofs.\r\n\r\nAmong the sculptures found here were the Barberini Faun, now at Munich,\r\nthe Dancing Faun, at Florence, and the Bust of Hadrian at the Vatican.\r\nThe sepulchral inscriptions of the Antonines existed till 1572, when\r\nthey were cut up by Gregory XIII. (Buoncompagni), and the marble used to\r\ndecorate a chapel in St Peter's! The magnificent Easter display of\r\nfireworks (from an idea of Michael Angelo, carried out by Bernini),\r\ncalled the girandola, used to be exhibited here, but now takes place at\r\nS. Pietro in Montorio, or from the Pincio. From 1849 to 1870, the castle\r\nwas occupied by French troops, and their banner floated here, except on\r\ngreat festivals, when it was exchanged for that of the pope.\r\n\r\nRunning behind, and crossing the back streets of the Borgo, is the\r\ncovered passage intended for the escape of the popes to the castle. It\r\nwas used by Alexander VI. when invaded by Charles VIII. in 1494, and\r\ntwice by Clement VII. (Giulio di Medici), who fled, in 1527, from\r\nMoncada, viceroy of Naples, and in May, 1527, during the terrible sack\r\nof Rome by the troops of the Constable de Bourbon.\r\n\r\n     \"Pendant que l'on se battait, Clement VII. était en prières devant\r\n     l'autel de sa chapelle au Vatican, détail singulier chez un homme\r\n     qui avait commencé sa carrière par être militaire. Lorsque les cris\r\n     des mourants lui annoncèrent la prise de la ville, il s'enfuit du\r\n     Vatican au château St. Ange par le long corridor qui s'élève\r\n     au-dessus des plus hautes maisons. L'historien Paul-Jove, qui\r\n     suivait Clement VII., relevait sa longue robe pour qu'il pût\r\n     marcher plus vîte, et lorsque le pape fut arrivé au pont qui le\r\n     laissait à découvert pour un instant, Paul-Jove le couvrit de son\r\n     manteau et de son chapeau violet, de peur qu'il ne fût reconnu à\r\n     son rochet blanc et ajusté par quelque soldat bon tireur.\r\n\r\n     \"Pendant cette longue fuite le long du corridor, Clement VII.\r\n     apercevait au-dessous de lui, par les petites fenêtres, ses sujets\r\n     poursuivis par les soldats vainqueurs qui déjà se répandaient dans\r\n     les rues. Ils ne faisaient aucun quartier à personne, et tuaient à\r\n     coups de pique tout ce qu'ils pouvaient atteindre.\"--_Stendhal_, i.\r\n     388.\r\n\r\n\"The Escape\" consists of two passages; the upper open like a loggia, the\r\nlower covered, and only lighted by loop-holes. The keys of both are kept\r\nby the pope himself.\r\n\r\nS. Angelo is at the entrance of _the Borgo_, promised at the Italian\r\ninvasion of September, 1870, as the sanctuary of the papacy, the tiny\r\nsovereignty where the temporal sway of the popes should remain\r\nundisturbed,--the sole relic left to them of all their ancient\r\ndominions. The Borgo, or _Leonine City_, is surrounded by walls of its\r\nown, which were begun in A.D. 846, by Pope Leo IV., for the better\r\ndefence of St. Peter's from the Saracens, who had been carrying their\r\ndevastations up to the very walls of Rome. These walls, 10,800 feet in\r\ncircumference, were completed in four years by labourers summoned from\r\nevery town and monastery of the Roman states. Pope Leo himself daily\r\nencouraged their exertions by his presence. In 852 the walls were\r\nsolemnly consecrated by a vast procession of the whole Roman clergy\r\nbarefooted, their heads strewn with ashes, who sprinkled them with holy\r\nwater, while the pope offered a prayer composed by himself,[322] at each\r\nof the three gates.\r\n\r\nThe adjoining Piazza Pia is decorated with a fountain erected by Pius\r\nIX. The principal of the streets which meet here is the Via del Borgo\r\nNuovo, the main artery to St. Peter's. On its left is the _Church of\r\nSta. Maria Traspontina_, built 1566, containing two columns which bear\r\ninscriptions, stating that they were those to which St. Peter and St.\r\nPaul were respectively attached, when they suffered flagellation by\r\norder of Nero!\r\n\r\nThis church occupies the site of a Pyramid supposed to have been erected\r\nto Scipio Africanus, who died at Liternum, B.C. 183, and which was\r\nregarded in the middle ages as the tomb of Romulus. Its sides were once\r\ncoated with marble, which was stripped off by Donus I. This pyramid is\r\nrepresented on the bronze doors of St Peter's.\r\n\r\nA little further is the _Palazzo Giraud_, belonging to Prince Torlonia.\r\nIt was built, 1506, by Bramante, for Cardinal Adriano da Corneto,[323]\r\nwho gave it to Henry VIII., by whom it was given to Cardinal Campeggio.\r\nThus it was for a short time the residence of the English ambassador\r\nbefore the Reformation. Innocent XII. converted it into a college for\r\npriests, by whom it was sold to the Marquis Giraud.\r\n\r\nFacing this palace is the _Piazza Scossa Cavalli_, with a pretty\r\nfountain. Its name bears witness to a curious legend, which tells how\r\nwhen St. Helena returned from Palestine, bringing with her the stone on\r\nwhich Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac, and that on which the Virgin\r\nMary sate down at the time of the presentation of the Saviour in the\r\nTemple, the horses drawing these precious relics stood still at this\r\nspot, and refused every effort to make them move. Then Christian people,\r\n\"recognising the finger of God,\" erected a church on this spot (S.\r\nGiacomo Scossa Cavalli), where the stones are still to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe Strada del Borgo Sto. Spirito contains the immense _Hospital of\r\nSanto Spirito_, running along the bank of the Tiber. This establishment\r\nwas founded in 1198 by Innocent III. Sixtus IV., in 1471, ordered it to\r\nbe rebuilt by Bacio Pintelli, who added a hall 376 feet long by 44 high\r\nand 37 wide. Under Benedict XIV., Ferdinando Fuga built another great\r\nhall. The altar in the midst of the great hall is the only work of\r\nAndrea Palladio in Rome. The church was designed by Bacio Pintelli, but\r\nbuilt by Antonio di San Gallo under Paul III. Under Gregory XIII.,\r\nOttaviano Mascherino built the palace of the governor, which unites the\r\nhospital with the church.\r\n\r\nThe institution comprises a hospital for every kind of disease,\r\ncontaining in ordinary times 1620 beds, a number which can be almost\r\ndoubled in time of necessity; a lunatic asylum containing an average of\r\n450 inmates; and a foundling hospital, where children are received from\r\nall parts of the papal states, and even from the Neapolitan towns.\r\nUpwards of 3000 foundlings pass through the hospital annually, but the\r\nmortality is very great,--in the return of 1846, as much as fifty-seven\r\nper cent. The person who wishes to deposit an infant rings a bell, when\r\na little bed is turned towards the grille near the door, in which the\r\nbaby is deposited. Close to this is another grille, without any apparent\r\nuse. \"What is that for?\" you ask. \"Because, when nurses come in from the\r\ncountry, they might be tempted to take the children for money, and yet\r\nnot feel any natural tenderness towards them, but by looking through the\r\nsecond grille, they can see the child, and discover if it is\r\n_simpatico_, and if not, they can go away and leave it.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the street one enters the Piazza Rusticucci (where Raphael\r\ndied), from which open the magnificent colonnades of Bernini, which lead\r\nthe eye up to the façade of St. Peter's, while the middle distance is\r\nbroken by the silvery spray of its glittering fountains.\r\n\r\nThe _Colonnades_ have 284 columns, are sixty-one feet wide, and\r\nsixty-four high; they enclose an area of 777 English feet; they were\r\nbuilt by Bernini for Alexander VII., 1657-67. In the centre is the\r\nfamous red granite _Obelisk of the Vatican_, brought to Rome from\r\nHeliopolis by Caligula, in a ship which Pliny describes as being \"nearly\r\nas long as the left side of the port of Ostia.\" It was used to adorn the\r\ncircus of Nero, and was brought from a position near the present\r\nsacristy of St. Peter's by Sixtus V. in 1586. Here it was elevated by\r\nDomenico Fontana, who estimated its weight at 963,537 Roman pounds; and\r\nemployed 800 men, 150 horses, and 46 cranes in its removal.\r\n\r\nThe obelisk was first exorcised as a pagan idol, and then dedicated to\r\nthe Cross. Its removal was preceded by high mass in St. Peter's, after\r\nwhich Pope Sixtus bestowed a solemn benediction upon Fontana and his\r\nworkmen, and ordained that none should speak, upon pain of death, during\r\nthe raising of the obelisk. The immense mass was slowly rising upon its\r\nbase, when suddenly it ceased to move, and it was evident that the ropes\r\nwere giving way. An awful moment of suspense ensued, when the breathless\r\nsilence was broken by a cry of \"Acqua alle funi!\"--_throw water on the\r\nropes_, and the workmen, acting on the advice so unexpectedly received,\r\nagain saw the monster move, and gradually settle on its base. The man\r\nwho saved the obelisk was Bresca, a sailor of Bordighiera, a village of\r\nthe Riviera di Ponente, and Sixtus V., in his gratitude, promised him\r\nthat his native village should ever henceforth have the privilege of\r\nfurnishing the Easter palms to St. Peter's. A vessel laden with\r\npalm-branches, which abound in Bordighiera, is still annually sent to\r\nthe Tiber in the week before Palm Sunday, and the palms, after being\r\nprepared and plaited by the nuns of S. Antonio Abbate, are used in the\r\nceremonial in St. Peter's.\r\n\r\nThe height of the whole obelisk is 132 feet, that of the shaft,\r\neighty-three feet. Upon the shaft is the inscription to Augustus and\r\nTiberius: \"DIVO. CÆS. DIVI. JULII. F. AUGUSTO.--TI. CÆSARI. DIVI. AUG.\r\nF.--AUGUSTA. SACRUM.\" The inscriptions on the base show its modern\r\ndedication to the Cross[324]--\"Ecce Crux Domini--Fugite partes\r\nadversæ--Vicit Leo de tribu Juda.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Sixte-quint s'applaudissait du succès, comme de l'œuvre la plus\r\n     gigantesque des temps modernes; des médailles furent frappées;\r\n     Fontana fut créé, noble romain, chevalier de l'Éperon d'or, et\r\n     reçut une gratification de 5,000 écus, indépendamment des matériaux\r\n     qui avaient servi à l'entreprise, et dont la valeur s'élevait à\r\n     20,000 écus (108,000 fr.); enfin des poëmes, dans toutes les\r\n     langues, sur ce nouveau triomphe de la croix, furent adressés aux\r\n     différents souverains de l'Europe.\"--_Gournerie, Rome Chrétienne_,\r\n     ii. 232.\r\n\r\n     \"In summer the great square basks in unalluring magnificence in the\r\n     midday sun. Its tall obelisk sends but a slim shadow to travel\r\n     round the oval plane, like the gnomon of a huge dial; its fountains\r\n     murmur with a delicious dreaminess, sending up massive jets like\r\n     blocks of crystal into the hot sunshine, and receiving back a\r\n     broken spray, on which sits serene an unbroken iris, but present no\r\n     'cool grot,' where one may enjoy their freshness; and in spite of\r\n     the shorter path, the pilgrim looks with dismay at the dazzling\r\n     pavement and long flight of unsheltered steps between him and the\r\n     church, and prudently plunges into the forest of columns at either\r\n     side of the piazza, and threads his way through their uniting\r\n     shadows, intended, as an inscription[325] tells him, for this\r\n     express purpose.\"--_Cardinal Wiseman._\r\n\r\n     \"Un jour Pie V. traversait, avec l'ambassadeur de Pologne, cette\r\n     place du Vatican. Pris d'enthousiasme au souvenir du courage des\r\n     martyrs qui l'ont arrosée de leurs larmes, et fertilisée par leur\r\n     sang, il se baisse, et saisissant dans sa main une poignée de\r\n     poussière: 'Tenez,' dit-il au représentant de cette noble nation,\r\n     'prenez cette poussière formée de la cendre des saints, et\r\n     imprégnée du sang des martyrs.'\r\n\r\n     \"L'ambassadeur ne portait pas dans son cœur la foi d'un pape, ni\r\n     dans son âme les illuminations d'un saint; il reçut pourtant avec\r\n     respect cette rélique étrange à ses yeux: mais revenu en son\r\n     palais, retirant, d'une main indifférente peut-être, le linge qui\r\n     la contenait, il le trouva ensanglanté.\r\n\r\n     \"La poussière avait disparu. La foi du pontife avait évoqué le sang\r\n     des martyrs, et ce sang généreux reparaissait à cet appel pour\r\n     attester, en face de l'hérésie, que l'Église romaine, au XVIe\r\n     siècle, était toujours celle pour laquelle ces héros avaient donné\r\n     leur vie sous Néron.\"--_Une Chrétienne à Rome._\r\n\r\nNo one can look upon the Piazza of St. Peter's without associating it\r\nwith the great religious ceremonies with which it is connected,\r\nespecially that of the Easter Benediction.\r\n\r\n     \"Out over the great balcony stretches a white awning, where priests\r\n     and attendants are collected, and where the pope will soon be seen.\r\n     Below, the piazza is alive with moving masses. In the centre are\r\n     drawn up long lines of soldiery, with yellow and red pompons, and\r\n     glittering helmets and bayonets. These are surrounded by crowds on\r\n     foot, and at the outer rim are packed carriages filled and overrun\r\n     with people, mounted on the seats and boxes. What a sight it\r\n     is!--above us the great dome of St. Peter's, and below, the grand\r\n     embracing colonnade, and the vast space, in the centre of which\r\n     rises the solemn obelisk thronged with masses of living beings.\r\n     Peasants from the Campagna and the mountains are moving about\r\n     everywhere. Pilgrims in oil-cloth cape and with iron staff demand\r\n     charity. On the steps are rows of purple, blue, and brown\r\n     umbrellas, for there the sun blazes fiercely. Everywhere crop forth\r\n     the white hoods of Sisters of Charity, collected in groups, and\r\n     showing, among the parti-coloured dresses, like beds of\r\n     chrysanthemums in a garden. One side of the massive colonnade casts\r\n     a grateful shadow over the crowd beneath, that fill up the\r\n     intervals of its columns; but elsewhere the sun burns down and\r\n     flashes everywhere. Mounted on the colonnade are crowds of people\r\n     leaning over, beside the colossal statues. Through all the heat is\r\n     heard the constant plash of the sun-lit fountains, that wave to and\r\n     fro their veils of white spray. At last the clock strikes. In the\r\n     far balcony are seen the two great showy peacock fans, and between\r\n     them a figure clad in white, that rises from a golden chair, and\r\n     spreads his great sleeves like wings as he raises his arms in\r\n     benediction. That is the pope, Pius the Ninth. All is dead silence,\r\n     and a musical voice, sweet and penetrating, is heard chanting from\r\n     the balcony;--the people bend and kneel; with a cold gray flash,\r\n     all the bayonets gleam as the soldiers drop to their knees, and\r\n     rise to salute as the voice dies away, and the two white wings are\r\n     again waved;--then thunder the cannon,--the bells clash and\r\n     peal,--a few white papers, like huge snow-flakes, drop wavering\r\n     from the balcony;--these are Indulgences, and there is an eager\r\n     struggle for them below;--then the pope again rises, again gives\r\n     his benediction,[326] waving to and fro his right hand, three\r\n     fingers open, and making the sign of the cross,--and the peacock\r\n     fans retire, and he between them is borne away,--and Lent is\r\n     over.\"--_Story's Roba di Roma._\r\n\r\nThe first church which existed on or near the site of the present\r\nbuilding, was the oratory founded in A.D. 90, by Anacletus, bishop of\r\nRome, who is said to have been ordained by St. Peter himself, and who\r\nthus marked the spot where many Christian martyrs had suffered in the\r\ncircus of Nero, and where St. Peter was buried after his crucifixion.\r\n\r\nIn 306 Constantine the Great yielded to the request of Pope Sylvester,\r\nand began the erection of a basilica on this spot, labouring with his\r\nown hands at the work, and himself carrying away twelve loads of earth,\r\nin honour of the twelve apostles.[327] Anastasius describes how the body\r\nof the great apostle was exhumed at this time, and re-interred in a\r\nshrine of silver, enclosed in a sarcophagus of gilt bronze. The early\r\nbasilica measured 395 feet in length by 212 in width. Its nave and\r\naisles were divided by eighty-six marble pillars of different sizes, in\r\ngreat part brought from the Septizonium of Severus, and it had an\r\natrium, and a _paradisus_, or quadrangular portico, along its\r\nfront.[328] Though only half the size of the present cathedral, still it\r\ncovered a greater space than any mediæval cathedral except those of\r\nMilan and Seville, with which it ranked in size.[329]\r\n\r\nThe old basilica suffered severely in the Saracenic invasion of 846,\r\nwhen some authorities maintain that even the tomb of the great apostle\r\nwas rifled of its contents, but it was restored by Leo IV., who raised\r\nthe fortifications of the Borgo for its defence.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable of its early _pilgrims_ were, Theodosius, who\r\ncame to pray for a victory over Eugenius; Valentinian, emperor of the\r\nEast, with his wife Eudoxia, and his mother Galla-Placidia; Belisarius,\r\nthe great general under Justinian; Totila; Cedwalla, king of the West\r\nSaxons, who came for baptism; Concred, king of the Mercians, who came to\r\nremain as a monk, having cut off and consecrated his long hair at the\r\ntomb of St. Peter; Luitprand, king of the Lombards; Ina of Wessex, who\r\nfounded a church here in honour of the Virgin, that Anglo-Saxons might\r\nhave a place of prayer, and those who died, a grave; Carloman of France,\r\nwho came for absolution and remained as a monk, first at S. Oreste\r\n(Soracte), then at Monte Casino; Richard of England; Bertrade, wife of\r\nPepin, and mother of Charlemagne; Offa, the Saxon, who made his kingdom\r\ntributary to St. Peter; Charlemagne (four times), who was crowned here\r\nby Leo III.; Lothaire, crowned by Paschal I.; and, in the last year of\r\nthe reign of Leo IV., Ethelwolf, king of the Anglo-Saxons, who was\r\ncrowned here, remained a year, and who brought with him his boy of six\r\nyears old, afterwards the great Alfred.\r\n\r\nOf the old basilica, the crypt is now the only remnant, and there are\r\ncollected the few relics preserved of the endless works of art with\r\nwhich it was filled, and which for the most part were lost or wilfully\r\ndestroyed, when it was pulled down. Its destruction was first planned by\r\nNicholas V. (1450), but was not carried out till the time of Julius\r\nII., who in 1506 began the new St. Peter's from designs of Bramante. The\r\nfour great piers and their arches above were completed, before the\r\ndeaths of both Bramante and Pope Julius interrupted the work. The next\r\npope, Leo X., obtained a design for a church in the form of a Latin\r\ncross from Raphael, which was changed, after his death (on account of\r\nexpense) to a Greek cross, by Baldassare Peruzzi, who only lived to\r\ncomplete the tribune. Paul III. (1534) employed Antonio di Sangallo as\r\nan architect, who returned to the design of a Latin cross, but died\r\nbefore he could carry out any of his intentions. Giulio Romano succeeded\r\nhim and died also. Then the pope, \"being inspired by God,\" says Vasari,\r\nsent for Michael Angelo, then in his seventy-second year, who continued\r\nthe work under Julius III., returning to the plan of a Greek cross,\r\nenlarging the tribune and transepts, and beginning the dome on a new\r\nplan, which he said would \"raise the Pantheon in the air.\" The dome\r\ndesigned by Michael Angelo, however, was very different to that which we\r\nnow admire, being much lower, flatter, and heavier. The present dome is\r\ndue to Giacomo della Porta, who brought the great work to a conclusion\r\nin 1590, under Sixtus V., who devoted 100,000 gold crowns annually to\r\nthe building. In 1605 Paul V. destroyed all that remained of the old\r\nbasilica, and employed Carlo Maderno as his architect, who once more\r\nreturned to the plan of the Latin cross, and completed the present ugly\r\nfaçade in 1614. The church was dedicated by Urban VIII., November 18th,\r\n1626; the colonnade added by Alexander VII., 1667, the sacristy by Pius\r\nVI., in 1780. The building of the present St. Peter's extended\r\naltogether over 176 years, and its expenses were so great that Julius\r\nII. and Leo X. were obliged to meet them by the sale of indulgences,\r\nwhich led to the Reformation. The expense of the main building alone has\r\nbeen estimated at 10,000,000_l._ The annual expense of repairs is\r\n6300_l._\r\n\r\n     \"St. Pierre est une sorte de ville à part dans Rome, ayant son\r\n     climat, sa température propre, sa lumière trop vive pour être\r\n     religieuse, tantôt deserte, tantôt traversée par des sociétés de\r\n     voyageurs, ou remplie d'une foule attirée par les cérémonies\r\n     religieuses (à l'époque des jubilés le nombre des pélerins s'est\r\n     parfois élevé à Rome, jusqu'à 400,000). Elle a ses reservoirs\r\n     d'eau; sa fontaine coulant perpetuellement au pied de la grande\r\n     coupole, dans un bassin de plomb, pour la commodité des travaux;\r\n     ses rampes, par lesquelles les bêtes de somme peuvent monter; sa\r\n     population fixe, habitant ses terrasses. Les San Pietriné, ouvriers\r\n     chargés de tous les travaux qu'exige la conservation d'un aussi\r\n     précieux edifice, s'y succèdent de père en fils, et forment une\r\n     corporation qui a ses lois et sa police.\"--_A. Du Pays._\r\n\r\nThe façade of St. Peter's is 357 feet long and 144 feet high. It is\r\nsurmounted by a balustrade six feet in height, bearing statues of the\r\nSaviour and the Twelve Apostles. Over the central entrance is the loggia\r\nwhere the pope is crowned, and whence he gives the Easter benediction.\r\nThe huge inscription runs--\"In. Honorem. Principis. Apost. Paulus V.\r\nBurghesius. Romanus. Pont. Max. A. MDCXII. Pont. VII.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I don't like to say the façade of the church is ugly and\r\n     obtrusive. As long as the dome overawes, that façade is\r\n     supportable. You advance towards it--through, O such a noble court!\r\n     with fountains flashing up to meet the sunbeams; and right and left\r\n     of you two sweeping half-crescents of great columns; but you pass\r\n     by the courtiers and up to the steps of the throne, and the dome\r\n     seems to disappear behind it. It is as if the throne was upset, and\r\n     the king had toppled over.\"--_Thackeray, The Newcomes._\r\n\r\nA wide flight of steps, at the foot of which are statues of St. Peter\r\nby _De Fabris_, and St. Paul by _Tadolini_, lead by fine entrances to\r\nthe _Vestibule_, which is 468 feet long, 66 feet high, and 50 feet wide.\r\nClosing it on the right is a statue of Constantine by _Bernini_--on the\r\nleft that of Charlemagne by _Cornacchini_. Over the principal entrance\r\n(facing the door of the church) is the celebrated _Mosaic of the\r\nNavicella_, executed 1298, by _Giotto_, and his pupil, _Pietro\r\nCavallini_.\r\n\r\n     \"For the ancient basilica of St. Peter, Giotto executed his\r\n     celebrated mosaic of the Navicella, which has an allegorical\r\n     foundation. It represents a ship, with the disciples, on an\r\n     agitated sea; the winds, personified as demons, storm against it;\r\n     above appear the Fathers of the Old Testament speaking comfort to\r\n     the sufferers. According to the early Christian symbolization, the\r\n     ship denoted the Church. Nearer, and on the right, in a firm\r\n     attitude, stands Christ, the Rock of the Church, raising Peter from\r\n     the waves. Opposite sits a fisherman in tranquil expectation,\r\n     denoting the hope of the believer. The mosaic has frequently\r\n     changed its place, and has undergone so many restorations, that the\r\n     composition alone can be attributed to Giotto. The fisherman and\r\n     the figures hovering in the air are, in their present form, the\r\n     work of Marcello Provenzale.\"--_Kugler_, i. 127.\r\n\r\n     \"This mosaic is ill placed and ill seen for an especial reason.\r\n     Early converts from paganism retained the heathen custom of turning\r\n     round to venerate the sun before entering a church, so that in the\r\n     old basilica, as here, the mosaic was thus placed to give a fitting\r\n     object of worship. The learned Cardinal Baronius never, for a\r\n     single day, during the space of thirty years, failed to bow before\r\n     this symbol of the primitive Church, tossed on the stormy sea of\r\n     persecution and of sin, saying, 'Lord, save me from the waves of\r\n     sin as thou didst Peter from the waves of the sea.' \"--_Mrs.\r\n     Elliot's Historical Pictures._\r\n\r\nThe magnificent central door of bronze is a remnant from the old\r\nbasilica, and was made in the time of Eugenius IV., 1431--39, by Antonio\r\nFilarete, and Simone, brother of Donatello. The bas-reliefs of the\r\ncompartments represent the martyrdoms of SS. Peter and Paul, and the\r\nprincipal events in the reign of Eugenius,--the Council of Florence,\r\nthe Coronation of Sigismund, emperor of Germany, &c. The bas-reliefs of\r\nthe framework are entirely mythological; Ganymede, Leda and her Swan,\r\n&c., are to be distinguished.\r\n\r\n     \"Corinne fit remarquer à Lord Nelvil que sur les portes étaient\r\n     représentées en bas-relief les métamorphoses d'Ovide. On ne se\r\n     scandalise point à Rome, lui dit-elle, des images du paganisme,\r\n     quand les beaux-arts les ont consacrées. Les merveilles du génie\r\n     portent toujours à l'âme une impression religieuse, et nous faisons\r\n     hommage au culte chrétien de tous les chefs-d'œuvre que les\r\n     autres cultes ont inspirés.\"--_Mad. de Staël._\r\n\r\nLet into the wall between the doors are three remarkable inscriptions:\r\n1. Commemorating the donation made to the church by Gregory II., of\r\ncertain olive-grounds to provide oil for the lamps; 2. The bull of\r\nBoniface VIII., 1300, granting the indulgence proclaimed at every\r\njubilee; 3. In the centre, the Latin epitaph of Adrian I. (Colonna,\r\n772-95), by Charlemagne,[330] one of the most ancient memorials of the\r\npapacy:\r\n\r\n    \"The father of the Church, the ornament of Rome, the famous writer Adrian,\r\n      the blessed pope, rests in peace:\r\n    God was his life, love was his law, Christ was his glory;\r\n    He was the apostolic shepherd, always ready to do that which was right.\r\n    Of noble birth, and descended from an ancient race,\r\n    He received a still greater nobility from his virtues.\r\n    The pious soul of this good shepherd was always bent\r\n    Upon ornamenting the temples consecrated to God.\r\n    He gave gifts to the churches, and sacred dogmas to the people;\r\n    And showed us all the way to heaven.\r\n    Liberal to the poor, his charity was second to none,\r\n    And he always watched over his people in prayer.\r\n    By his teachings, his treasures, and his buildings, he raised,\r\n    O illustrious Rome, thy monuments, to be the honour of the town\r\n     and of the world.\r\n    Death could not injure him, for its sting was taken away by the\r\n      death of Christ;\r\n      It opened for him the gate of the better life.\r\n    I, Charles, have written these verses, while weeping for my father;\r\n      O my father, my beloved one, how lasting is my grief for thee.\r\n    Dost thou think upon me, as I follow thee constantly in spirit;\r\n    Now reign blessed with Christ in the heavenly kingdom.\r\n    The clergy and people have loved you with a heart-love,\r\n    Thou wert truly the love of the world, O excellent priest.\r\n    O most illustrious, I unite our two names and titles,\r\n    Adrian and Charles, the king and the father.\r\n    O thou who readest these verses, say with pious heart the prayer;\r\n    O merciful God, have pity upon them both.\r\n    Sweetly slumbering, O friend, may thy earthly body rest in the grave,\r\n    And thy spirit wander in bliss with the saints of the Lord\r\n    Till the last trumpet sounds in thine ears,\r\n    Then arise with Peter to the contemplation of God.\r\n    Yes, I know that thou wilt hear the voice of the merciful judge\r\n    Bid thee to enter the paradise of thy Saviour.\r\n    Then, O great father, think upon thy son,\r\n    And ask, that with the father the son may enter into joy.\r\n    Go, blessed father, enter into the kingdom of Christ,\r\n    And thence, as an intercessor, help thy people with thy prayers.\r\n    Even so long as the sun rolls upon its fiery axis,\r\n    Shall thy glory, O heavenly father, remain in the world.\r\n\r\n     Adrian the pope, of blessed memory, reigned for three-and-twenty\r\n     years, ten months, and seventeen days, and died on the 25th of\r\n     December.\"\r\n\r\nThe walled-up door on the right is the _Porta Santa_, only opened for\r\nthe jubilee, which has taken place every twenty-fifth year (except 1850)\r\nsince the time of Sixtus IV. The pope himself gives the signal for the\r\ndestruction of the wall on the Christmas-eve before the sacred year.\r\n\r\n     \"After preliminary prayers from Scripture singularly apt, the pope\r\n     goes down from his throne, and, armed with a silver hammer, strikes\r\n     the wall in the doorway, which, having been cut round from its\r\n     jambs and lintel, falls at once inwards, and is cleared away in a\r\n     moment by the San Pietrini. The pope, then, bare-headed and torch\r\n     in hand, first enters the door, and is followed by his cardinals\r\n     and his other attendants to the high altar, where the first vespers\r\n     of Christmas Day are chaunted as usual. The other doors of the\r\n     church are then flung open, and the great queen of churches is\r\n     filled.\"--_Cardinal Wiseman._\r\n\r\n     \"Arrêtez-vous un moment ici, dit Corinne à Lord Nelvil, comme il\r\n     était déjà sous le portique de l'église; arrêtez-vous, avant de\r\n     soulever le rideau qui couvre la porte du temple; votre cœur ne\r\n     bat-il pas à l'approche de ce sanctuaire? Et ne ressentez-vous pas,\r\n     au moment d'entrer, tout ce que ferait éprouver l'attente d'un\r\n     évènement solennel?\"--_Mad. de Staël._\r\n\r\nWe now push aside the heavy double curtain and enter the Basilica.\r\n\r\n     \"Hilda had not always been adequately impressed by the grandeur of\r\n     this mighty cathedral. When she first lifted the heavy leathern\r\n     curtains, at one of the doors, a shadowy edifice in her imagination\r\n     had been dazzled out of sight by the reality.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\n     \"The ulterior burst upon our astonished gaze, resplendent in light,\r\n     magnificence, and beauty, beyond all that imagination can conceive.\r\n     Its apparent smallness of size, however, mingled some degree of\r\n     surprise, and even disappointment, with my admiration; but as I\r\n     walked slowly up its long nave, empanelled with the rarest and\r\n     richest marbles, and adorned with every art of sculpture and taste,\r\n     and caught through the lofty arches opening views of chapels, and\r\n     tombs, and altars of surpassing splendour, I felt that it was,\r\n     indeed, unparalleled in beauty, in magnitude, and magnificence, and\r\n     one of the noblest and most wonderful of the works of\r\n     man.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"St Peter's, that glorious temple--the largest and most beautiful,\r\n     it is said, in the world, produced upon me the impression rather of\r\n     a Christian pantheon, than of a Christian church. The æsthetic\r\n     intellect is edified more than the God-loving or God-seeking soul.\r\n     The exterior and interior of the building appear to me more like an\r\n     apotheosis of the popedom than a glorification of Christianity and\r\n     its doctrine. Monuments to the popes occupy too much space. One\r\n     sees all round the walls angels flying upwards with papal\r\n     portraits, sometimes merely with papal tiaras.\"--_Frederika\r\n     Bremer._\r\n\r\n     \"L'Architecture de St. Pierre est une musique fixée.\"--_Madame de\r\n     Staël._\r\n\r\n     \"The building of St. Peter's surpasses all powers of description.\r\n     It appears to me like some great work of nature, a forest, a mass\r\n     of rocks, or something similar; for I never can realise the idea\r\n     that it is the work of man. You strive to distinguish the ceiling\r\n     as little as the canopy of heaven. You lose your way in St.\r\n     Peter's, you take a walk in it, and ramble till you are quite\r\n     tired; when divine service is performed and chaunted there, you are\r\n     not aware of it till you come quite close. The angels in the\r\n     Baptistery are enormous giants; the doves, colossal birds of prey;\r\n     you lose all sense of measurement with the eye, or proportion; and\r\n     yet who does not feel his heart expand, when standing under the\r\n     dome, and gazing up at it.\"--_Mendelssohn's Letters._\r\n\r\n    \"But thou, of temples old, or altars new,\r\n    Standest alone--with nothing like to thee--\r\n    Worthiest of God, the holy and the true.\r\n    Since Zion's desolation, when that He\r\n    Forsook His former city, what could be\r\n    Of earthly structures, in His honour piled,\r\n    Of a sublimer aspect?

Il semble, que\r\n     là, le péché n'accable plus; le sentiment vif du pardon par le\r\n     triomphe de la résurrection remplit seul le cœur.\"--_Eugénie de\r\n     la Ferronays._\r\n\r\n     \"The temperature of St. Peter's seems, like the happy islands, to\r\n     experience no change. In the coldest weather it is like summer to\r\n     your feelings, and in the most oppressive heats it strikes you with\r\n     a delightful sensation of cold--a luxury not to be estimated but in\r\n     a climate such as this.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nOn each side of the nave are four pillars with Corinthian pilasters, and\r\na rich entablature supporting the arches. The roof is vaulted, coffered,\r\nand gilded. The pavement is of coloured marble, inlaid from designs of\r\nGiacomo della Porta and Bernini. In the centre of the floor, immediately\r\nwithin the chief entrance, is a round slab of porphyry, upon which the\r\nemperors were crowned.\r\n\r\nThe enormous size of the statues and ornaments in St. Peter's do away\r\nwith the impression of its vast size, and it is only by observing the\r\nliving, moving figures, that one can form any idea of its colossal\r\nproportions. A line in the pavement is marked with the comparative size\r\nof the other great Christian churches. According to this the length of\r\nSt Peter's is 613½ feet; of St. Paul's, London, 520½ feet; Milan\r\nCathedral, 443 feet; St. Sophia, Constantinople, 360½ feet. The\r\nheight of the dome in the interior is 405 feet; on the exterior, 448\r\nfeet. The height of the baldacchino is 94½ feet.\r\n\r\nThe first impulse will be to go up to the shrine, around which a circle\r\nof eighty-six gold lamps is always burning, and to look down into the\r\nConfessional, where there is a beautiful kneeling statue of Pope Pius\r\nVI. (Braschi, 1785--1800) by _Canova_. Hence one can gaze up into the\r\ndome, with its huge letters in purple-blue mosaic upon a gold ground\r\n(each six feet long).[331] \"Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram\r\nædificabo ecclesiam meam, et tibi dabo claves regni cœlorum.\" Above\r\nthis are four colossal mosaics of the Evangelists from designs of the\r\nCav. d'Arpino; the pen of St. Luke is seven feet in length.\r\n\r\n     \"The cupola is glorious, viewed in its design, its altitude, or\r\n     even its decorations; viewed either as a whole or as a part, it\r\n     enchants the eye, it satisfies the taste, it expands the soul. The\r\n     very air seems to eat up all that is harsh or colossal, and leaves\r\n     us nothing but the sublime to feast on:--a sublime peculiar as the\r\n     genius of the immortal architect, and comprehensible only on the\r\n     spot.\"--_Forsyth._\r\n\r\n     \"Ce dôme, en le considérant même d'en bas, fait éprouver une sorte\r\n     de terreur; on croit voir des abîmes suspendus sur sa\r\n     tête.\"--_Madame de Staël._\r\n\r\n_The Baldacchino_, designed by Bernini in 1633, is of bronze, with gilt\r\nornaments, and was made chiefly with bronze taken from the roof of the\r\nPantheon. It covers the high altar, which is only used on the most\r\nsolemn occasions. Only the pope can celebrate mass there, or a cardinal\r\nwho is authorised by a papal brief.\r\n\r\n     \"Without a sovereign priest officiating before and for his people,\r\n     St. Peter's is but a grand aggregation of splendid churches,\r\n     chapels, tombs, and works of art. With him, it becomes a whole, a\r\n     single, peerless temple, such as the world never saw before. That\r\n     central pile, with its canopy of bronze as lofty as the Farnese\r\n     Palace, with its deep-diving stairs leading to a court walled and\r\n     paved with precious stones, that yet seems only a vestibule to some\r\n     cavern or catacomb, with its simple altar that disdains ornament in\r\n     the presence of what is beyond the reach of human price,--that\r\n     which in truth forms the heart of the great body, placed just where\r\n     the heart should be, is then animated, and surrounded by living and\r\n     moving sumptuousness. The immense cupola above it, ceases to be a\r\n     dome over a sepulchre, and becomes a canopy over an altar; the\r\n     quiet tomb beneath is changed into the shrine of relics below the\r\n     place of sacrifice--the saints under the altar;--the quiet spot at\r\n     which a few devout worshippers at most times may be found, bowing\r\n     under the hundred lamps, is crowded by rising groups, beginning\r\n     from the lowest step, increasing in dignity and in richness of\r\n     sacred robes, till, at the summit and in the centre, stands supreme\r\n     the pontiff himself, on the very spot which becomes him, the one\r\n     living link in a chain, the first ring of which is rivetted to the\r\n     shrine of the Apostles below.... St. Peter's is only itself when\r\n     the pope is at the high altar, and hence only by, or for, him it is\r\n     used.\"--_Cardinal Wiseman._\r\n\r\nThe four huge piers which support the dome are used as shrines for the\r\nfour great relics of the church, viz., 1. The lance of S. Longinus, the\r\nsoldier who pierced the side of our Saviour, presented to Innocent\r\nVIII., by Pierre d'Aubusson, grandmaster of the Knights of Rhodes, who\r\nhad received it from the Sultan Bajazet;[332] 2. The head of St. Andrew,\r\nsaid to have been brought from Achaia in 1460, when its arrival was\r\ncelebrated by Pius II.; 3. A portion of the true cross, brought by Sta.\r\nHelena; 4. The napkin of Sta. Veronica, said, doubtless from the\r\naffinity of names, to bear the impression--vera-icon--of our Saviour's\r\nface.\r\n\r\n     \"The 'Volto-Santo,' said to be the impress of the countenance of\r\n     our Saviour on the handkerchief of Sta. Veronica, or Berenice,\r\n     which wiped his brow on the way to Calvary, was placed in the\r\n     Vatican by John VII., in 707, and afterwards transferred to the\r\n     Church of Santo Spirito, where six Roman noblemen had the care of\r\n     it, each taking charge of one of the keys with which it was locked\r\n     up. Among the privileges enjoyed for this office, was that of\r\n     receiving, every year, from the hospital of Santo Spirito at the\r\n     feast of Pentecost, two cows, whose flesh, an ancient chronicle\r\n     says, 'si mangiavano lì, con gran festa.' In 1440, this picture was\r\n     carried back to St. Peter's, whence it has not since been moved.\r\n     When I examined the head on the Veronica handkerchief, it struck me\r\n     as undoubtedly a work of early Byzantine art, perhaps of the\r\n     seventh or eighth century, painted on linen. It is with implicit\r\n     acceptance of its claims that Petrarch alludes to it--'verendam\r\n     populis Salvatoris Imaginem.' Ep. ix., lib. 2. During the\r\n     republican domination in 1849, it was rumoured that about Easter,\r\n     the canons of St. Peter saw the Volto-Santo turn pale, and\r\n     ominously change colour while they gazed upon it.\"--_Hemans'\r\n     Catholic Italy_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of exhibiting the relics from the balcony above the statue\r\nof Sta. Veronica takes place on Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter\r\nDay, but the height is so great that nothing can really be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\n     \"To-day we gazed on the Veronica--the holy impression left by our\r\n     Saviour's face on the cloth Sta. Veronica presented to him to wipe\r\n     his brow, bowed under the weight of the Cross. We had looked\r\n     forward to this sight for days, for seven thousand years of\r\n     indulgence from penance are attached to it.\r\n\r\n     \"But when the moment came we could see nothing but a black board\r\n     hung with a cloth, before which another white cloth was held. In a\r\n     few minutes this was withdrawn, and the great moment was over, the\r\n     glimpse of the sacred thing on which hung the fate of seven\r\n     thousand years.\"--_Schönberg-Cotta Chronicles._\r\n\r\nThe niches in the piers are occupied by four statues, of Longinus, St.\r\nAndrew, Sta. Helena, and Sta. Veronica, holding the napkin or\r\n\"sudarium,\" \"flourishing a marble pocket-handkerchief.\"[333]\r\n\r\n     \"Malheureusement toutes ces statues pèchent par le goût. Le rococo,\r\n     mis à la mode par le Bernin, est surtout exécrable dans le genre\r\n     colossale. Mais la présence du génie de Bramante et de Michel-Ange\r\n     se fait tellement sentir, que les choses ridicules ne le sont plus\r\n     ici; elles ne sont qu' insignifiantes. Les statues colossales des\r\n     piliers représentent: St. André, par François Quesnoy (Fiammingo),\r\n     elle excita la jalousie du Bernin; St. Veronique par M. Mochi, dont\r\n     il blamait les draperies volantes (dans un endroit clos). Un\r\n     plaisant lui répondait que leur agitation provenait du vent qui\r\n     soufflait par les crevasses de la coupole, depuis qu'il avait\r\n     affaibli les piliers par des niches et tribunes: St. Hélène par A.\r\n     Bolgi, St. Longin par Bernin.\"--_A. Du Pays._\r\n\r\nNot very far from the confessional, against the last pier on the right\r\nof the nave, stands the statue of St. Peter, said to have been cast by\r\nLeo the Great, from the old statue of Jupiter Capitolinus. It is of very\r\nrude workmanship. Its extended foot is eagerly kissed by Roman Catholic\r\ndevotees, who then rub their foreheads against its toes. Protestants\r\nwonder at the feeling which this figure excites. Gregory II. wrote of it\r\nto Leo the Isaurian: \"Christ is my witness, that when I enter the temple\r\nof the prince of the Apostles, and contemplate his image, I am filled\r\nwith such emotion, that tears roll down my cheeks like the rain from\r\nheaven.\" On high festivals the statue is dressed up in full pontificals.\r\nOn the day of the jubilee of Pius IX. (June 16, 1871), it was attired in\r\na lace alb, stole, and gold-embroidered cope, fastened at the breast by\r\na clasp of diamonds; and its foot was kissed by upwards of 20,000\r\npersons during the day.\r\n\r\n     \"La coutume antique chez les Grecs d'habiller et de parer les\r\n     statues sacrées s'était conservée à Rome et s'y conserve encore.\r\n     Tout le monde a vu la statue de saint Pierre revêtir dans les\r\n     grandes solennités ses magnifiques habits de pape. On lavait les\r\n     statues des dieux, on les frottait, on les frisait comme des\r\n     poupées. Les divinités du Capitole avaient un nombreux domestique\r\n     attaché à leur personne et qui était chargé de ce soin. L'usage\r\n     romain a subsisté chez les populations latines de l'Espagne et\r\n     elles l'ont porté jusqu'au Mexique où j'ai vu, à Puebla, la veille\r\n     d'une fête, une femme de chambre faire une toilette en règle à une\r\n     statue de la Vierge.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iv. 91.\r\n\r\nAlong the piers of the nave and transepts are ranged statues of the\r\ndifferent Founders, male and female, of religious Orders.\r\n\r\nReturning to the main entrance, we will now make the tour of the\r\nbasilica. Those who expect to find monuments of great historical\r\ninterest will, however, be totally disappointed. Scarcely anything\r\nremains above-ground which is earlier than the sixteenth century. Of the\r\ntombs of the eighty-seven popes who were buried in the old basilica, the\r\ngreater part were totally lost at its destruction,--a few were removed\r\nto other churches (those of the Piccolomini to S. Andrea della Valle,\r\n&c.), and some fragments are still to be seen in the crypt. Only two\r\nmonuments were replaced in the new basilica, those of the two popes who\r\nlived in the time and excited the indignation of Savonarola--\"Sixtus\r\nIV., with whose cordial concurrence the assassination of Lorenzo di\r\nMedici was attempted--and Innocent VIII., the main object of whose\r\npolicy was to secure place and power for his illegitimate children.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The side-chapels are splendid, and so large that they might serve\r\n     for independent churches. The monuments and statues are numerous,\r\n     but all are subordinate, or unite harmoniously with the large and\r\n     beautiful proportions of the chief temple. Everything there is\r\n     harmony, light, beauty--an image of the church-triumphant, but a\r\n     very worldly, earthly image; and whilst the mind enjoys its\r\n     splendour, the soul cannot, in the higher sense, be edified by its\r\n     symbolism.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\nThe first chapel on the right derives its name from the _Pietà of\r\nMichael Angelo_, representing the dead Saviour upon the knees of the\r\nMadonna, a work of the great artist in his twenty-fourth year, upon an\r\norder from the French ambassador, Cardinal Jean de Villiers, abbot of\r\nSt. Denis. The sculptor has inscribed his name (the only instance in\r\nwhich he has done so) upon the girdle of the Virgin. Francis I.\r\nattempted to obtain this group from Michael Angelo in 1507, together\r\nwith the statue of Christ at the Minerva, \"comme de choses que l'on m'a\r\nassuré estre des plus exquises et excellentes en votre art.\" Opening\r\nfrom this chapel are two smaller ones. That on the right has a Crucifix\r\nby _Pietro Cavallini_; the mosaic, representing St. Nicholas of Bari, is\r\nby _Christofari_. That on the left is called _Cappella della Colonna\r\nSanta_, from a column, said to have been brought from Jerusalem, and to\r\nhave been that against which our Saviour leant, when he prayed and\r\ntaught in the temple. It is inscribed:\r\n\r\n     \"Hæc est illa columna in qua DNS Nr Jesus XPS appodiatus dum\r\n     populo prædicabat et Deo p[=n]o preces in templo effundebat\r\n     adhærendo, stabatque una cum aliis undeci hic circumstantibus de\r\n     Salomonis templo in triumphum. Hujus Basilicæ hic locata fuit\r\n     demones expellit et immundis spiritibus vexatos liberos reddit et\r\n     multa miracula cotidie facit. P. reverendissimum pre[=m] et Dominum\r\n     Dominus. Card. de Ursinis. A.D. MDCCCXXXVIII.\"\r\n\r\nA more interesting object in this chapel is the sarcophagus (once used\r\nas a font) of Anicius Probus, a prefect of Rome in the fourth century,\r\nof the great family of the Anicii, to which St. Gregory the Great\r\nbelonged. Its five compartments have bas-reliefs, representing Christ\r\nand the Apostles.\r\n\r\nReturning to the aisle, on the right, is the tomb of Leo XII., Annibale\r\ndella Genga (1823--29) by _Fabris_; on the left is the tomb of Christina\r\nof Sweden, daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, who died at Rome, 1689, by\r\n_Carlo Fontana_, with a bas-relief by Teudon, representing her\r\nabjuration of Protestantism in 1655, in the cathedral of Innspruck.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the altar of St. Sebastian, with a mosaic copy of\r\nDomenichino's picture at Sta. Maria degli Angeli; beyond which is the\r\ntomb of Innocent XII., Antonio Pignatelli (1691--1700). This was the\r\nlast pope who wore the martial beard and moustache, which we see\r\nrepresented in his statue. Pignatella is Italian for a little cream-jug;\r\nin allusion to this we may see three little cream-jugs in the upper\r\ndecorations of this monument, which is by _Filippo Valle_. On the left\r\nis the tomb, by _Bernini_, of the Countess Matilda, foundress of the\r\ntemporal power of the popes, who died in 1115, was buried in a monastery\r\nnear Mantua, and transported hither by Urban VIII. in 1635. The\r\nbas-relief represents the absolution of Henry IV. of Germany, by\r\nHildebrand, which took place at her intercession and in her presence.\r\n\r\nWe now reach, on the right, the large _Chapel of the Santissimo\r\nSacramento_, decorated with a fresco altar-piece, representing the\r\nTrinity, by _Pietro da Cortona_, and a tabernacle of lapis-lazuli and\r\ngilt bronze, copied from Bramante's little temple at S. Pietro in\r\nMontorio. Here is the magnificent tomb of Sixtus IV., Francesco della\r\nRovere (1471--81), removed from the choir of the old St. Peter's, where\r\nit was erected by his nephew, Cardinal Giulio della Rovere, afterwards\r\nPope Julius II. This pope's reign was entirely occupied with politics,\r\nand he was secretly involved in the conspiracy of the Pazzi at Florence;\r\nhe was the first pope who carried nepotism to such an extent as to found\r\na principality (Imola and Forli) for his nephew Girolamo Riario. The\r\ntomb is a beautiful work of the Florentine artist, _Antonio Pollajuola_,\r\nin 1493. The figure of the pope reposes upon a bronze couch, surrounded,\r\nin memory of his having taught successively in the six great\r\nuniversities of Italy, with allegorical bas-reliefs of Arithmetic,\r\nAstrology, Philology, Rhetoric, Grammar, Perspective, Music, Geography,\r\nPhilosophy, and Theology, which last is represented like a pagan Diana,\r\nwith a quiver of arrows on her shoulders. Close to this monument of his\r\nuncle, a flat stone in the pavement marks the grave of Julius II., for\r\nwhom the grand tomb at S. Pietro in Vincoli was intended.\r\n\r\nReturning to the aisle, we see on the right the tomb of Gregory XIII.,\r\nUgo Buoncompagni (1572--85), during whose reign the new calendar was\r\ninvented, an event commemorated in a bas-relief upon the monument,\r\nwhich was not erected till 1723, and is by _Camillo Rusconi_. The figure\r\nof the pope (he died aged eighty-four) is in the attitude of\r\nbenediction: beneath are Wisdom, represented as Minerva, and Faith,\r\nholding a tablet inscribed, \"Novi opera hujus et fidem.\" Opposite this\r\nis the paltry tomb of Gregory XIV., Nicolo Sfrondati (1590--91).\r\n\r\n     \"Le tombeau de Gregoire XIII., que le massacre de Saint Barthélemy\r\n     réjouit si fort, est de marbre. Le tombeau de stuc ou d'abord il\r\n     avait été placé, a été accordé, après son départ, au cendres de\r\n     Grégoire XIV.\"--_Stendhal._\r\n\r\nOn the left, against the great pier, is a mosaic copy of Domenichino's\r\nCommunion of St. Jerome. On the right is the chapel of the Madonna,\r\nfounded by Gregory XIII., and built by Giacomo della Porta. The cupola\r\nhas mosaics by Girolamo Muziano. Beneath the altar is buried St. Gregory\r\nNazianzen, removed hither from the convent of Sta. Maria in the Campo\r\nMarzo by Gregory XIII.\r\n\r\n     St. Gregory Nazianzen (or St. Gregory Theologos) was son of St.\r\n     Gregory and St. Nonna, and brother of St. Gorgonia and St. Cesarea.\r\n     He was born _c._ A.D. 328. In his childhood he was influenced by a\r\n     vision of the two virgins, Temperance and Chastity, summoning him\r\n     to pursue them to the joys of Paradise. Being educated at Athens\r\n     (together with Julian the Apostate), he formed there a great\r\n     friendship with St. Basil. He became first the coadjutor,\r\n     afterwards the successor, of his father, in the bishopric of\r\n     Nazianzen, but removed thence to Constantinople, where he preached\r\n     against the Arians. By the influence of Theodosius, he was ordained\r\n     Bishop of Constantinople, but was so worn out by the cabals and\r\n     schisms in the Church, that he resigned his office, and retired to\r\n     his paternal estate, where he passed the remainder of his life in\r\n     the composition of Greek hymns and poems. He died May 9, A.D. 390.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the tomb of Benedict XIV., Prospero Lambertini\r\n(1740--58), by _Pietro Bracci_, a huge and ugly monument. On the left\r\nis the tomb of Gregory XVI., Mauro-Cappellari (1831--46), by _Amici_,\r\nerected in 1855 by the cardinals he had created.\r\n\r\nTurning into the right transept, used as a council-chamber (for which\r\npurpose it proved thoroughly unsatisfactory), 1869--70, we find several\r\nfine mosaics from pictures, viz.: The Martyrdom of SS. Processus and\r\nMartinianus from the Valentin at the Vatican; the Martyrdom of St.\r\nErasmus from Poussin; St. Wenceslaus, king of Bohemia, from Caroselli;\r\nOur Saviour walking on the sea to the boat of St. Peter, from Lanfranco.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the last-named mosaic is the famous monument of Clement\r\nXIII., Carlo Rezzonico (1758--69), in whose reign the Order of Jesuits\r\nwas attacked by all the sovereigns of the house of Bourbon, and expelled\r\nfrom Portugal, France, Spain, Naples, and Parma. The pope, who had long\r\ndefended them, was about to yield to the pressure put upon him and had\r\ncalled a consistory for their suppression, but died suddenly on the\r\nevening before its assembling. This tomb, the greatest work of Canova,\r\nwas uncovered April 4, 1795, in the presence of an immense crowd, with\r\nwhom the sculptor mingled, disguised as an abbé, to hear their opinion.\r\nThe pope (aged 75) is represented in prayer, upon a pedestal, beneath\r\nwhich is the entrance to a vault, guarded by two grand marble lions. On\r\nthe right is Religion, standing erect with a cross; on the left the\r\nGenius of Death, holding a torch reversed. The beauty of this work of\r\nCanova is only felt when it is compared with the monuments of the\r\nseventeenth century in St. Peter's; \"then it seems as if they were\r\nseparated by an abyss of centuries.\"[334]\r\n\r\nBeyond this are mosaics from the St. Michael of Guido at the Cappuccini,\r\nand from the Martyrdom of St. Petronilla, of Guercino, at the Capitol.\r\nEach of these large mosaics has cost about 150,000 francs.\r\n\r\nNow, on the right, is the tomb of Clement X., Gio. Baptista Altieri\r\n(1670--76), by _Rossi_, the statue by _Ercole Ferrata_; and on the left,\r\nis a mosaic of St. Peter raising Tabitha from the dead, by Costanzi.\r\n\r\nAscending into the tribune, we see at the end of the church, beneath the\r\nvery ugly window of yellow glass, the \"Cathedra Petri\" of _Bernini_,\r\nsupported by figures of the four Fathers of the Church, Augustine,\r\nAmbrose, Chrysostom, and Athanasius. Enclosed in this, is a very ancient\r\nwooden senatorial chair, encrusted with ivory, which is believed to have\r\nbeen the episcopal throne of St. Peter and his immediate successors.\r\nLate Roman Catholic authorities (Mgr. Gerbet, &c.) consider that it may\r\nperhaps have been originally the chair of the senator Pudens, with whom\r\nthe apostle lodged. A magnificent festival in honour of St. Peter's\r\nchair (Natale Petri de Cathedra) has been annually celebrated here from\r\nthe earliest times, and is mentioned in a calendar of Pope Liberius of\r\nA.D. 354. It was said that if any pope were to reign longer than the\r\ntraditional years of the government of St. Peter (Pius IX. is the first\r\npope who has done so), St. Peter's chair would be again brought into\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the chair is the tomb of Urban VIII., Matteo Barberini\r\n(1623--44), who was chiefly remarkable from his passion for building,\r\nand who is perpetually brought to mind through the immense number of his\r\nerections which still exist. The tomb is by _Bernini_, the architect of\r\nhis endless fountains and public buildings, and has the usual fault of\r\nthis sculptor in overloading his figures (except in that of Urban\r\nhimself, which is very fine,[335]) with meaningless drapery. Figures of\r\nCharity and Justice stand by the black marble sarcophagus of the pope,\r\nand a gilt skeleton is occupied in inscribing the name of Urban on the\r\nlist of Death. The whole monument is alive with the bees of the\r\nBarberini. The pendant tomb on the left is that of Paul III., Alessandro\r\nFarnese (1534--50), in whose reign the Order of the Jesuits was founded.\r\nThis pope (the first Roman who had occupied the throne for 103\r\nyears--since Martin V.) was learned, brilliant, and witty. He was adored\r\nby his people, in spite of his intense nepotism, which induced him to\r\nform Parma into a duchy for his natural son Pierluigi, to build the\r\nFarnese Palace, and to marry his grandson Ottavio to Marguerite, natural\r\ndaughter of Charles V., to whom he gave the Palazzo Madama and the Villa\r\nMadama as a dowry. His tomb, by _Guglielmo della Porta_, perhaps the\r\nfinest in St. Peter's, cost 24,000 Roman crowns; it was erected in the\r\nold basilica just before its destruction in 1562,--and in 1574 was\r\ntransferred to this church, where its position was the source of a\r\nquarrel between the sculptor and Michael Angelo, by whose interest he\r\nhad obtained his commission.[336] It was first placed on the site where\r\nthe Veronica now stands, whence it was moved to its present position in\r\n1629. The figure of the pope is in bronze. In its former place four\r\nmarble statues adorned the pedestal; two are now removed to the Farnese\r\nPalace; those which remain, of Prudence and Justice, were once entirely\r\nnude, but were draped by Bernini. The statue of Prudence is said to\r\nrepresent Giovanna Gaetani da Sermoneta, the mother of the pope, and\r\nthat of Justice his famous sister-in-law, Giulia.\r\n\r\n     \"On a dit de ces figures que c'était le Rubens en sculpture.\"--_A.\r\n     Du Pays._\r\n\r\nNear the steps of the tribune are two marble slabs, on which Pius IX.\r\nhas immortalised the names of the cardinals and bishops who, on December\r\n8, 1854, accepted, on this spot, his dogma of the Immaculate Conception.\r\n\r\nTurning towards the left transept;--on the left is a mosaic of St. Peter\r\nhealing the lame man, from _Mancini_. On the right is the tomb of\r\nAlexander VIII., Pietro Ottobuoni (1689--91), by _Giuseppe Verlosi_ and\r\n_Angelo Rossi_, gorgeous in its richness of bronze, marbles, and\r\nalabasters. Beyond this is the altar of Leo the Great, over which is a\r\nhuge bas-relief, by _Algardi_, representing S. Leo calling down the\r\nassistance of SS. Peter and Paul against the invasion of Attila.\r\n\r\n     \"The king of the Huns, terrified by the apparition of the two\r\n     apostles in the air, turns his back and flies. We have here a\r\n     picture in marble, with all the faults of taste and style which\r\n     prevailed at that time, but the workmanship is excellent; it is,\r\n     perhaps, the largest bas-relief in existence, excepting the rock\r\n     sculpture of the Indians and Egyptians--at least fifteen feet in\r\n     height.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 685.\r\n\r\nNext to this is the Cappella della Colonna, possessing a much revered\r\nMadonna from a pillar of the old basilica, and beneath it an ancient\r\nChristian sarcophagus containing the remains of Leo II. (ob. 683), Leo\r\nIII. (ob. 816), and Leo IV. (ob. 855). In the pavement near these two\r\naltars is the slab tomb of Leo XII. (ob. 1828), with an epitaph\r\nillustrating Invocation of Saints, but touching in its humility.\r\n\r\n     \"Commending myself, a suppliant, to my great celestial patron Leo,\r\n     I, Leo XII., his humble client, unworthy of so great a name, have\r\n     chosen a place of sepulture, near his holy ashes.\"\r\n\r\nOver the door known as the Porta Sta. Marta (from the church in the\r\nsquare behind St. Peter's, to which it leads), is the tomb of Alexander\r\nVII., Fabio Chigi (1655--67), the last work of _Bernini_, who had built\r\nfor this pope the Scala-Regia and the Colonnade of St. Peter's. This is,\r\nperhaps, the worst of all the papal monuments--a hideous figure of Death\r\nis pushing aside an alabaster curtain and exhibiting his hour-glass to\r\nthe kneeling pope.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this tomb is an oil painting on slate, by _Francesco Vanni_,\r\nof the Fall of Simon Magus. The south transept has a series of mosaic\r\npictures; The Incredulity of St. Thomas from Camuccini, the Crucifixion\r\nof St. Peter and a St. Francis from Guido, and, on the pier of the\r\nCupola, Ananias and Sapphira from the Roncalli at Sta. Maria degli\r\nAngeli, and the Transfiguration from Raphael.[337]\r\n\r\nOpposite the mosaic of Ananias and Sapphira is the last tomb erected in\r\nSt. Peter's, that of Pius VIII., Francesco Castiglione (1829--31), by\r\n_Tenerani_. It represents the pope kneeling, and above him the Saviour\r\nin benediction, with SS. Peter and Paul. It is of no great merit.\r\n\r\nThe Cappella Clementina has the Miracle of St. Gregory the Great from\r\nthe Andrea Sacchi at the Vatican. Close to this is the fine tomb of Pius\r\nVII., Gregorio Chiaramonte (1800--23), who crowned Napoleon,--who\r\nsuffered exile for seven years for refusing to abdicate the temporal\r\npower,--and who returned in triumph to die at the Quirinal, after having\r\nre-established the Order of the Jesuits. His monument is the work of\r\n_Thorwaldsen_, graceful and simple, though perhaps too small to be in\r\nproportion to the neighbouring tombs. The figure of the pope, a gentle\r\nold man (he died at the age of eighty-one, having reigned twenty-three\r\nyears), is seated in a chair; figures of Courage and Faith adorn the\r\npedestal. The tomb was erected by Cardinal Gonsalvi, the faithful friend\r\nand minister of this pope (who died very poor, having spent all his\r\nwealth in charity), at an expense of 27,000 scudi.\r\n\r\nTurning into the left aisle,--on the right is the tomb of Leo XI.,\r\nAlessandro de Medici (1605), to which one is inclined to grudge so much\r\nspace, considering that the pope it commemorates only reigned twenty-six\r\ndays. The tomb, in allusion to this short life, is sculptured with\r\nflowers, and bears the motto, _Sic Florui_. It is the work of _Algardi_.\r\nThe figures of Wisdom and Abundance, which adorn the pedestal, are fine\r\nspecimens of this allegorical type.\r\n\r\nOpposite, is the tomb of Innocent XI., Benedetto Odescalchi (1676--89),\r\nby _Etienne Monot_, with a bas-relief representing the raising of the\r\nsiege of Vienna by King John Sobieski.\r\n\r\nNear this, is the entrance to the Cappella del Coro, the very\r\ninconvenient chapel (decorated with gilding and stucco by Giacomo della\r\nPorta), in which the vesper services are held. The altar-piece is a\r\nmosaic copy of the Conception by Pietro Bianchi at the Angeli. In the\r\npavement is the gravestone of Clement XI., Giov. Francesco Albani\r\n(1700--21).\r\n\r\nUnder the next arch of the aisle, on the left, is the interesting tomb\r\nof Innocent VIII., Gio. Battista Cibò (1484--92), by Pietro and Antonio\r\nPollajuolo. The pope is represented asleep upon his sarcophagus, and a\r\nsecond time above, seated on a throne, his right hand extended in\r\nbenediction, and his left holding the sacred lance of Longinus (said to\r\nhave been that which pierced the side of our Saviour), sent to him by\r\nthe sultan Bajazet. It is supposed that it was owing to the\r\nrepresentation of this relic, that this tomb alone (except that of\r\nSixtus IV., uncle of the destroyer), was replaced after the destruction\r\nof the old basilica. Upon the sarcophagus of the pope is inscribed, in\r\nallusion to the name of Innocent, the 11th verse of the 26th Psalm, \"In\r\ninnocentiâ meâ ingressus sum, redime me Domine et miserere mei.\"\r\nOpposite, is a tomb which is a kind of Memento Mori to the living pope,\r\nwhich always bears the name of his predecessor, and in which his corpse\r\nwill be deposited, till his real tomb is prepared. \"This tomb is now\r\nempty, and awaits its prey, Pius IX.\"[338]\r\n\r\nPassing the Cappella della Presentazione, which contains a mosaic from\r\nthe \"Presentation of the Virgin,\" by _Romanelli_, we reach the last\r\narch, which contains the tombs of the Stuarts. On the right is the\r\nmonument, by _Filippo Barigioni_, of Maria Clementina Sobieski, wife of\r\nJames III., called in the inscription \"Queen of Great Britain, France,\r\nand Ireland\"; on the left is that by Canova to the three Stuart princes,\r\nJames III. and his sons, Charles Edward, and Henry--Cardinal York. It\r\nbears this inscription:\r\n\r\n                  \"JACOBO III.\r\n      JACOBI II., MAGNÆ BRIT.

Often at the present day does the British\r\n     traveller turn from the sunny crest of the Pincian, or the carnival\r\n     throng of the Corso, to gaze, in thoughtful silence, on that\r\n     mockery of human greatness, and that last record of ruined hopes!\r\n     The tomb before him is of a race justly expelled; the magnificent\r\n     temple that enshrines it is of a faith wisely reformed; yet who at\r\n     such a moment would harshly remember the errors of either, and\r\n     might not join in the prayer even of that erring Church for the\r\n     departed, 'Requiescant in pace.'\"--_Lord Mahon._\r\n\r\nThe last chapel is the Baptistery, and contains, as a font, the ancient\r\nporphyry cover of the sarcophagus of Hadrian, which was afterwards used\r\nfor the tomb of the Emperor Otho II. The mosaic of the Baptism of our\r\nSaviour is from Carlo Maratta.\r\n\r\nDistributed around the whole basilica are confessionals for every\r\nChristian tongue.\r\n\r\n     \"Au milieu de toutes les créations hardies et splendides de l'art\r\n     dans le basilique de St. Pierre, il est une impression morale qui\r\n     saisit l'esprit, à la vue des confessionaux des diverses langues.\r\n     Il y a là encore une autre espèce de grandeur.\"--_A. Du Pays._\r\n\r\n_The Crypt of St. Peter's_ can always be visited by gentlemen, on\r\napplication in the sacristy; but by ladies only with a special\r\npermission. The entrance is near the statue of Sta. Veronica. The\r\nvisitor is terribly hurried in his inspection of this, the most\r\nhistorically interesting part of the basilica, and the works of art it\r\ncontains are so ill-arranged, as to be difficult to investigate or\r\nremember. The crypt is divided into two portions, the _Grotte Nuove_,\r\noccupying the area beneath the dome, and opening into some ancient\r\nlateral chapels,--and the _Grotte Vecchie_, which extended under the\r\nwhole nave of the old basilica, and reaches as far as the Cappella del\r\nCoro of the present edifice.\r\n\r\nThe first portion entered is a corridor in the Grotte Nuove. Hence open,\r\non the right, two ancient chapels. The first, _Sta. Maria in Portico_,\r\nderives its name from a picture of the Virgin, attributed to _Simone\r\nMemmi_, which stood in the portico of the old basilica; it contains,\r\nbesides several statues from the magnificent monument of Nicholas V.,\r\nwhich perished with the old church, a statue of St. Peter which stood in\r\nthe portico, and the cross which crowned its summit. The second chapel,\r\n_Sta. Maria delle Partorienti_, has a mosaic of our Saviour in\r\nbenediction, from the tomb of Otho II.; a mosaic of the Virgin, of the\r\neighth century; several ancient inscriptions; and, at the entrance,\r\nstatues of the two apostles James, from the tomb of Nicholas V. Behind\r\nthis chapel were preserved the remains of Leo II., III., and IX., till\r\nthey were removed to the upper church by Leo XII.\r\n\r\nEntering the _Grotte Vecchie_, we find a nave and aisles separated by\r\npilasters with low arches. Following the south aisle we are first\r\narrested by the marble inscription relating to the donation of lands\r\nmade by the Countess Matilda to the church in 1102. Near this is the\r\nsmall _Cappella del Salvatore_, containing a bas-relief of the Virgin\r\nand Child by _Arnolfo_, which once decorated the tomb of Boniface\r\nVIII.,--and the grave of Charlotte, Queen of Cyprus, who died in 1487.\r\nNear this are the sepulchral urns of the three Stuart princes,\r\ncommemorated in the upper church. At the end of this aisle is the tomb\r\nof the Emperor Otho II., who died at Rome in A.D. 983; this formerly\r\nstood in the portico of the basilica.\r\n\r\nHere is the empty tomb of Alexander VI., Rodrigo Borgia (1492--1503),\r\nthe wicked and avaricious father of Cæsar and Lucretia, who is believed\r\nto have died of the poison which he intended for one of his cardinals.\r\nThe body of this pope was not allowed to rest in peace. Julius II., the\r\nbitter enemy of the Borgias, turned it out of its tomb, and had it\r\ncarried to S. Giacomo degli Spagnuoli, whence, when that church was\r\npulled down, it was taken to Sta. Maria di Monserrato. The empty\r\nsarcophagus is surmounted by the figure of Alexander, who was himself a\r\nhandsome old man, and in whose features may be traced the lineaments of\r\nthe splendid Cæsar Borgia, known to us from the picture in the Borghese\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the central nave is the sarcophagus of Christina of\r\nSweden, who has a monument in the upper church.\r\n\r\nThe first tomb in the south aisle, beginning from the west, is that of\r\nBoniface VIII., Benedetto Gaetani (1294--1303).\r\n\r\n     \"The last prince of the Church, who understood the papacy in the\r\n     sense of universal dominion, in the spirit of Gregory VII., of\r\n     Alexander and Innocent III. Two kings held the bridle of his\r\n     palfrey as he rode from St Peter's to the Lateran after his\r\n     election. He received Dante as the ambassador of Florence; in 1300\r\n     he instituted the jubilee; and his reign--filled with contests with\r\n     Philip le Bel of France and the Colonnas--ended in his being taken\r\n     prisoner in his palace at Anagni by Sciarra Colonna and William of\r\n     Nogaret, and subjected to the most cruel indignities. He was\r\n     rescued by his fellow-citizens and conducted to Rome by the Orsini,\r\n     but he died thirty seven days after of grief and mortification. The\r\n     Ghibelline story relates that he sate alone silently gnawing the\r\n     top of his staff, and at length dashed out his brains against the\r\n     wall, or smothered himself with his own pillows. But the\r\n     contemporary verse of the Cardinal St. George describes him as\r\n     dying quietly in the midst of his cardinals, at peace with the\r\n     world, and having received all the consolations of the\r\n     Church.\"--_See Milman's Latin Christianity_, vol. V.\r\n\r\nThe character of Boniface has ever been one of the battlefields of\r\nhistory. He was scarcely dead when the epitaph, \"He came in like a fox,\r\nhe ruled like a lion, he died like a dog,\" was proclaimed to\r\nChristendom. He was consigned by Dante to the lowest circle of Hell; yet\r\neven Dante expressed the universal shock with which Christendom beheld\r\n\"the Fleur de lis enter Anagni, and Christ again captive in his\r\nVicar,--the mockery, the gall and vinegar, the crucifixion between\r\nliving robbers, the cruelty of the second Pilate.\" In later times,\r\nTosti, Drumann, and lastly, Cardinal Wiseman, have engaged in his\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nBoniface VIII. was buried with the utmost magnificence in a splendid\r\nchapel, which he had built himself, and adorned with mosaics, and where\r\na grand tomb was erected to him. Of this nothing remains now, but the\r\nsarcophagus, which bears a majestic figure of the pope by _Arnolfo del\r\nCambio_.\r\n\r\n     \"The head is unusually beautiful, severe and noble in its form, and\r\n     corresponds perfectly with the portrait which we have (at the\r\n     Lateran) from the hand of Giotto, which represents his face as\r\n     beardless and of the most perfect oval. His head is covered by a\r\n     long, pointed mitre, like a sugar-loaf, decked with two crowns.\r\n     This proud man was indeed the first who wore the double crown,--all\r\n     his predecessors having been content with a simple crowned mitre.\r\n     This new custom existed till the tune of Urban V., by whom the\r\n     third crown was added.\"--_Gregorovius, Grabmäler der Päpste._\r\n\r\nClose to that of Boniface are the sarcophagi of Pius II., Æneas Sylvius\r\nPiccolomini (1458--64) and Pius III., Antonio Todeschini Piccolomini\r\n(1503), whose monuments are removed to S. Andrea della Valle.\r\n\r\nNext beyond Boniface is the tomb of Adrian IV. (Nicholas Breakspeare,\r\n1154--59), the only Englishman who ever occupied the papal throne.[339]\r\nHe is buried in a pagan sarcophagus of red granite, adorned with Medusa\r\nheads in relief, and without any inscription.\r\n\r\nOpposite this, is a sarcophagus bearing the figure of Nicholas V.,\r\nTomaso di Sarzana(1447--55), being nearly all that has been preserved of\r\nthe glorious tomb of that pope, who founded the Vatican library,\r\ncollected around him a court of savants and poets, and \"with whom opened\r\nthe age of papacy to which belonged the times of Julius II. and Leo X.\"\r\nHis epitaph, attributed to Pius II., is by his secretary Mafeo Vegio.\r\n\r\n    \"The bones of Nicholas V. rest in this grave,\r\n    Who gave to thee, O Rome! thy golden age.\r\n    Famous in council, more famous in shining virtue,\r\n    He honoured wise men, who was himself the wisest of all.\r\n    He gave healing to the world, long wounded with schism,\r\n    And renewed at once its manners and customs, and the buildings\r\n     and temples of the city.\r\n    He gave an altar to St. Bernardino of Siena\r\n    When he celebrated the holy year of jubilee.\r\n    He crowned with gold the forehead of Frederick and his wife,\r\n    And gave order to the affairs of Italy by the treaty which he made.\r\n    He translated many Greek writings into the Latin tongue;--\r\n    Then offer incense to-day at his holy grave.\"\r\n\r\nNext comes a remnant of the tomb of Paul II., Pietro Barbo (1464--71),\r\nchiefly remarkable for his personal beauty, of which he was so vain,\r\nthat when he issued from the conclave as pope, he wished to take the\r\nname of Formosus. This pontiff built the Palazzo S. Marco, and gave a\r\nname to the Corso, by establishing the races there. He also prepared for\r\nhimself one of the most splendid tombs in the old basilica, for which he\r\nobtained Mino da Fiesole as an architect It was his wish to lie in the\r\nporphyry sarcophagus of Sta. Costanza, which he stole from her church\r\nfor this purpose; hence the simplicity of the existing sarcophagus,\r\nwhich bears his effigy. Beyond this, are sarcophagi of Julius III., Gio.\r\nMaria Ciocchi del Monte (1550--55), builder of the Villa Papa Giulio;\r\nand Nicholas III., Orsini (1277--81), who made a treaty with Rudolph of\r\nHapsburg, and obtained from him a ratification of the donation of the\r\nCountess Matilda. Then comes the sarcophagus of Urban VI., Bartolomeo\r\nPrignani (1378--87), the sole relic of a most magnificent tomb of this\r\ncruel pope, who is believed to have died of poison. It bears his figure,\r\nand in the front, a bas-relief of him receiving the keys from St. Peter.\r\nHis epitaph runs:\r\n\r\n    \"Here rests the just, wise, and noble prince,\r\n    Urban VI., a native of Naples.\r\n    He, full of zeal, gave a safe refuge to the teachers of the faith.\r\n    That gained for him, noble one, a fatal poison cup at the close\r\n     of the repast.\r\n    Great was the schism, but great was his courage in opposing it,\r\n    And in the presence of this mighty pope Simony sate dumb.\r\n    But it is needless to reiterate his praises upon earth,\r\n    While heaven is shining with his immortal glory.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Sepelitur in beati Petri Basilica, paucis admodum ejus mortem,\r\n     utpote hominis rustici et inexorabilis, flentibus. Hujus autem\r\n     sepulchrum adhuc visitur cum epitaphio satis rustico et\r\n     inepto.\"--_Platina._\r\n\r\nNext come the sarcophagi of Innocent VII., Cosmato de Miliorati\r\n(1404--6), bearing his figure; of Marcellus II., Marcello Cervini\r\n(1555), who only reigned twenty-five days; and of Innocent IX., Giov.\r\nAntonio Facchinetti (1591--92), who reigned only sixty.\r\n\r\nNear these is the urn of Agnese Gaetani Colonna, the only lady not of\r\nroyal birth buried in the basilica.\r\n\r\nHence we return to the corridor of the Grotte Nuove, containing a number\r\nof mosaics and statues detached from different papal tombs, the best\r\nbeing those from that of Nicholas V. and that of Paul II., by _Mino da\r\nFiesole_ (a figure of Charity is especially beautiful), and a bas-relief\r\nof the Virgin and Child, by _Arnolfo_, from the tomb of Benedict VIII.\r\n\r\nHere also are a half-length statue of Boniface VIII., ascribed to\r\n_Andrea Pisano_; a half-length of Benedict XII., by _Paolo di Siena_;\r\nand a figure of St. Peter seated on a gothic throne which once supported\r\na statue of Benedict XII.\r\n\r\nThe _Chapel of St. Longinus_ has a mosaic from a picture by Andrea\r\nSacchi. Near the entrance of the shrine are marble reliefs of the\r\nmartyrdoms of St. Peter and St. Paul. Opposite to the entrance of the\r\nshrine is the magnificent sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, Christian\r\nprefect of Rome, who died A.D. 359. It was discovered near its present\r\nsite in 1595. It is adorned with admirable sculptures from the Old and\r\nNew Testament.\r\n\r\nOpening from the centre of the circular passage is the _Confession or\r\nShrine of SS. Peter and Paul_, which contains the sarcophagus brought\r\nfrom the Catacomb near S. Sebastiano in 257, and which the Roman\r\nCatholic Church has always revered as that of St. Peter. On the altar,\r\nconsecrated in 1122, are two ancient pictures of St. Peter and St.\r\nPaul. Only half the bodies of the saints are held to be preserved here,\r\nthe other portion of that of St. Peter being at the Lateran, and of St.\r\nPaul at S. Paolo fuori Mura.\r\n\r\nTo the Roman Catholic mind this is naturally one of the most sacred\r\nspots in the world, since it holds literally the words of St. Ambrose,\r\nthat: \"Where Peter is, there is the Church,--and where the Church is,\r\nthere is no death, but life eternal.\"[340]\r\n\r\n     \"From this place Peter, from this place Paul, shall be caught up in\r\n     the resurrection. Oh consider with trembling that which Rome will\r\n     behold, when Paul suddenly rises with Peter from this sepulchre,\r\n     and is carried up into the air to meet the Lord.\"--_St. John\r\n     Chrysostom, Homily on the Ep. to the Romans._\r\n\r\n     \"Among the cemeteries ascribed by tradition to apostolic times, the\r\n     crypts of the Vatican would have the first claim on our attention,\r\n     had they not been almost destroyed by the foundations of the vast\r\n     basilica which guards the tomb of St. Peter.... The _Liber\r\n     Pontificalis_ says that Anacletus, the successor of Clement in the\r\n     Apostolic See, '_built_ and adorned the sepulchral monument\r\n     (_construxit memoriam_) of blessed Peter, since he had been\r\n     ordained priest by St. Peter, and other burial-places where the\r\n     bishops might be laid.' It is added that he himself was buried\r\n     there; and the same is recorded of Linus and Cletus, and of\r\n     Evaristus, Sixtus I., Telesphorus, Hyginus, Pius I., Eleutherius,\r\n     and Victor, the last of whom was buried A.D. 203; and after St.\r\n     Victor, no other pontiff is recorded to have been buried at the\r\n     Vatican until Leo the Great was laid in St. Peter's, A.D. 461. The\r\n     idea conveyed by the words _construxit memoriam_ is that of a\r\n     monument above-ground according to the usual Roman custom; and we\r\n     have seen that such a monument, even though it covered the tomb of\r\n     Christian bishops, would not be likely to be disturbed at any time\r\n     during the first or second century. For the reason we have already\r\n     stated, it is impossible to confront these ancient notices with any\r\n     existing monuments. It is worth mentioning, however, that De Rossi\r\n     believes that the sepulchre of St. Linus was discovered in this\r\n     very place early in the seventeenth century, bearing simply the\r\n     name of Linus.\"--_Northcote and Brownlow, Roma Setterranea._\r\n\r\nTo ascend the _Dome of St. Peter's_ requires a special order. The\r\nentrance is from the first door in the left aisle, near the tomb of\r\nMaria-Clementina Sobieski. The ascent is by an easy staircase _à\r\ncordoni_, the walls of which bear memorial tablets of all the royal\r\npersonages who have ascended it. The aspect of the roof is exceedingly\r\ncurious from the number of small domes and houses of workmen with which\r\nit is studded,--quite a little village in themselves. A chamber in one\r\nof the pillars which support the dome contains a model of the ancient\r\nthrone of St. Peter, and a model of the church, by Michael Angelo and\r\nhis predecessor, Antonio di Sangallo. The dome is 300 feet above the\r\nroof, and 613½ feet in circumference. An iron staircase leads thence\r\nto the ball, which is capable of containing sixteen persons.\r\n\r\n     \"Cette hauteur fait frémir,\" dit Beyle, \"quand on songe aux\r\n     tremblements de terre qui agitent fréquemment l'Italie, et qu'un\r\n     instant peut vous priver du plus beau monument qui existe.\r\n     Certainement jamais il ne serait relevé: nous sommes trop\r\n     _raisonables_.\"\r\n\r\n     \"De Brosse raconte que deux moines espagnoles, qui se trouvaient\r\n     dons la boule de St. Pierre lors de la secousse de 1730, eurent une\r\n     telle peur, que l'un d'eux mourut sur la place.\"--_A. Du Pays._\r\n\r\n_The Sacristy of St. Peter's_, which is entered by a grey marble door on\r\nthe left, before turning into the south transept, was built by Pius VI.,\r\nin 1755, from designs of _Carlo Marchione_. It consists of three halls,\r\nwith a corridor adorned with columns and inscriptions from the old\r\nchurch, and with statues of SS. Peter and Paul, which stood in front of\r\nit. The central hall, _Sagrestia Commune_, is adorned with eight fluted\r\npillars of grey marble (bigio) from Hadrian's Villa. On the left is the\r\n_Sagrestia dei Canonici_, with the Cappella dei Canonici, which has two\r\npictures, the Madonna and Saints (Anna, Peter, and Paul), by _Francesco\r\nPenni_, and the Madonna and Child, _Giulio Romano_. Hence opens the\r\n_Stanza Capitolare_, containing an interesting remnant of the many works\r\nof Giotto in the old basilica under Boniface VIII. (for which he\r\nreceived 3020 gold florins), in three panel pictures belonging to the\r\nciborium for the high altar ordered by Cardinal Stefaneschi, and\r\nrepresenting,--Christ with that Cardinal,--the Crucifixion of St.\r\nPeter,--the Execution of St. Peter,--and on the back of the same panel,\r\nanother picture, in which Cardinal Stefaneschi is offering his ciborium\r\nto St. Peter.\r\n\r\n     \"The fragments which are preserved of the painting which Giotto\r\n     executed for the Church of St. Peter cannot fail to make us regret\r\n     its loss. The fragments are treated with a grandeur of style which\r\n     has led Rumohr to suspect that the susceptible imagination of\r\n     Giotto was unable to resist the impression which the ancient\r\n     mosaics of the Christian basilicas must have produced upon\r\n     him.\"--_Rio. Poetry of Christian Art._\r\n\r\nHere also are several fragments of the frescoes (of angels and\r\napostles), by _Melozzo da Forlì_, which existed in the former dome of\r\nthe SS. Apostoli, and of which the finest portion is now at the Quirinal\r\nPalace. On the right is the _Sagrestia dei Benefiziati_, which contains\r\na picture of the Saviour giving the keys to St. Peter, by _Muziano_, and\r\nan image called La Madonna della Febbre, which stood in the old\r\nSacristy. Opening hence is the _Treasury of St. Peter's_, containing\r\nsome ancient jewels, crucifixes, and candelabra, by Benvenuto Cellini\r\nand Michael Angelo, and, among other relics, the famous sacerdotal robe\r\ncalled the _Dalmatica di Papa San Leone_, \"said to have been embroidered\r\nat Constantinople for the coronation of Charlemagne as Emperor of the\r\nWest, but fixed by German criticism as a production of the twelfth, or\r\nthe early part of the thirteenth century. The emperors, at least, have\r\nworn it ever since, while serving as deacons at the pope's altar during\r\ntheir coronation-mass.\"\r\n\r\n     \"It is a large robe of stiff brocade, falling in broad and unbroken\r\n     folds in front and behind,--broad and deep enough for the\r\n     Goliath-like stature and the Herculean chest of Charlemagne\r\n     himself. On the breast the Saviour is represented in glory, on the\r\n     back the Transfiguration, and on the two shoulders Christ\r\n     administering the Eucharist to the Apostles. In each of these last\r\n     compositions, our Saviour, a stiff but majestic figure, stands\r\n     behind the altar, on which are deposited a chalice and a paten or\r\n     basket containing crossed wafers. He gives, in the one case, the\r\n     cup to St. Paul, in the other the bread to St. Peter,--they do not\r\n     kneel, but bend reverently to receive it; five other disciples\r\n     await their turn in each instance,--all are standing.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not apprehend your being disappointed with the Dalmatica di\r\n     San Leone, or your dissenting from my conclusion, that a master, a\r\n     Michael-Angelo I would almost say, then flourished at Byzantium.\r\n\r\n     \"It was in this Dalmatica--then _semée_ all over with pearls and\r\n     glittering in freshness--that Cola di Rienzi robed himself over his\r\n     armour in the sacristy of St. Peter's and thence ascended to the\r\n     Palace of the Popes, after the manner of the Cæsars, with sounding\r\n     trumpets and his horsemen following him--his truncheon in his hand\r\n     and his crown on his head--'terribile e fantastico,' as his\r\n     biographer describes him--to wait upon the Legate.\"--_Lord\r\n     Lindsay's Christian Art_, i. 137.\r\n\r\nAbove the Sacristy are the _Archives of St. Peter's_, containing, among\r\nmany other ancient MSS., a life of St. George, with miniatures, by\r\n_Giotto_. The entrance to the Archivio, at the end of the corridor, is\r\nadorned with fragments of the chains of the ports of Smyrna and Tunis.\r\nHere, also, is a statue of Pius VI., by _Agostino Penna_.\r\n\r\nIt is quite worth while to leave St. Peter's by the Porta Sta. Marta\r\nbeneath the tomb of Alexander VII., in order to examine the exterior of\r\nthe church from behind, where it completely dwarfs all the surrounding\r\nbuildings. Among these are the _Church of S. Stefano_, with a fine door\r\ncomposed of antique fragments, and the dismal _Church of Sta. Marta_,\r\nwhich contains several of the Roman weights known as \"Pietra di\r\nParagone,\" said to have been used in the martyrdoms. Beyond the Sacristy\r\nis the pretty little _Cimeterio dei Tedeschi_, the oldest of Christian\r\nburial-grounds, said to have been set apart by Constantine, and filled\r\nwith earth from Calvary. It was granted to the Germans in 1779, by Pius\r\nVI. Close by is the _Church of Sta. Maria della Pietà in Campo Santo_.\r\n\r\nNot far from hence (in a street behind the nearest colonnade) is the\r\n_Palazzo del Santo Uffizio--or of the Inquisition_. This body, for some\r\ntime past, suppressed everywhere except in the States of the Pope, was\r\nestablished here in 1536 by Paul III., acting on the advice of Cardinal\r\nCaraffa, afterwards Paul IV., for inquiry into cases of heresy, and the\r\npunishment of ecclesiastical offences. It was by the authority of the\r\n\"Holy Office\" that the \"Index\" of prohibited books was first drawn up.\r\nPaul IV., on his deathbed, summoned the cardinals to his side, and\r\nrecommended to them this \"Santissimo Tribunale,\" as he called it, and\r\nsucceeding popes have protected and encouraged it. The character of the\r\nInquisition has been much changed from that which it bore three hundred\r\nyears ago; but even in late years, many cases of extreme severity have\r\nbeen reported,--especially one of a French bishop cruelly imprisoned for\r\nsixteen years in one of its dungeons (merely because he had received his\r\nconsecration from a French constitutional prelate), and who was only\r\nreleased when its doors were opened in the revolution of 1848.\r\n\r\n     \"Within these walls has been confined for many years a very\r\n     extraordinary person--the archbishop of Memphis.... Pope Leo XII.\r\n     received a letter from the Pacha of Egypt informing his Holiness,\r\n     that he and a large portion of his subjects desired to be received\r\n     into the bosom of the Church of Rome; and announcing that he and\r\n     they were willing to conform, provided the pope would send out an\r\n     archbishop, with a suitable train of ecclesiastics, and requesting\r\n     that his Holiness would do him the favour of appointing a certain\r\n     young student whom he named, the first archbishop of Memphis, and\r\n     despatch him to Egypt. No doubt was entertained as to the truth of\r\n     this communication, but an objection presented itself in the youth\r\n     of the ecclesiastical student whom the Pacha wished to have as his\r\n     archbishop. The pope consulted his cardinals, who advised him not\r\n     to make the dangerous precedent of raising a novice to so high a\r\n     rank in the Church, but his Holiness, tempted by the desire of\r\n     converting a kingdom to Christianity, resolved to conform to the\r\n     wishes of the Pacha, and did consecrate the youth archbishop of\r\n     Memphis. The archbishop was sent out attended by a train of priests\r\n     to Egypt. When the ship arrived, the authorities in Egypt declared\r\n     the affair was an imposition. His Grace confessed the fraud, was\r\n     arrested, and reconducted to Rome. He was the author of the letter\r\n     which imposed on the pope--his original intention having been to\r\n     confess to the pope as a priest, after his consecration, the\r\n     imposition he had practised; and as the pope could not betray a\r\n     secret imparted to him at the confessional, the offender might have\r\n     obtained absolution, and escaped punishment. Whether this would\r\n     have been practicable I know not; but it was not accomplished, and\r\n     as the youth had the rank of archbishop indelibly imprinted on him,\r\n     nothing remained but to confine his Grace for the remainder of his\r\n     life; and accordingly he was confined to this prison near the\r\n     Vatican, whence he may find it difficult to escape.\"--_Whiteside's\r\n     Italy_, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal of the Inquisition was formally abolished by the Roman\r\nAssembly in February, 1849, but was re-established by Pius IX. in the\r\nfollowing June. Its meetings, however, now take place in the Vatican,\r\nand the old palace of the Holy Office was long used as a barrack for\r\nFrench soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of the building is a lofty hall, with gloomy frescoes of\r\nDominican saints,--and many terrible dungeons and cells in which the\r\nvictim is unable to stand upright, having their vaulted ceilings lined\r\nwith reeds, to deaden sound,--but all this is seldom seen. When the\r\npeople rushed into the Inquisition at the revolution, a number of human\r\nbones were found in these vaults, which so excited the popular fury,\r\nthat an attack on the Dominican convent at the Minerva was anticipated.\r\nArdent defenders of the papacy maintain that these bones had been\r\npreviously transported to the Inquisition from a cemetery, to get up a\r\nsensation.[341]\r\n\r\nBuilt up into the back of this palace is the tribune of the _Church of\r\nS. Salvatore in Torrione or in Macello_, whose foundation is ascribed to\r\nCharlemagne (797). Senerano (Sette Chiese) supposes that the French had\r\nhere their schola or special centre for worship and assemblage. The\r\nwindows of this building are among the few examples of gothic in Rome,\r\nand there are good terra-cotta mouldings. It may best be seen from the\r\n_Porta Cavalleggieri_, which was designed by Sangallo, and derives its\r\nname from the cavalry barracks close by.\r\n\r\nA short distance from the lower end of the Colonnade is the _Church of\r\nS. Michaele in Sassia_, whose handsome tower is a relic of the church\r\nfounded by Leo IV., who built the walls of the Borgo, especially for\r\nfuneral masses for the souls of those who fell in its defence against\r\nthe Saracens. Raphael Mengs is buried in the modern church.\r\n\r\nThe name of this church commemorates the Saxon settlement \"called Burgus\r\nSaxonum, Vicus Saxonum, Schola Saxonum, and simply Saxia or\r\nSassia,\"[342] founded _c._ 727 by Ina, king of Wessex, and enlarged in\r\n794 by Offa, king of Mercia, when he made a pilgrimage to Rome in\r\npenance for the murder of Ethelbert, king of East-Anglia. Ina founded\r\nhere a church, \"Sta. Maria quæ vocatur Schola Saxorum,\" which is\r\nmentioned as late as 854. Dyer (Hist. of the City of Rome) says that\r\n\"when Leo IV. enclosed this part of the city, it obtained the name of\r\nBorgo, from the Burgus Saxonum, and one of the gates was called Saxonum\r\nPosterula. The 'Schola Francorum' was also in the Borgo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE VATICAN.\r\n\r\n     History of the Vatican Quarter and of the Palace--Scala\r\n     Regia--Pauline Chapel--Sistine Chapel--Sala Ducale--Court of St.\r\n     Damasus--Galleria Lapidaria--Braccio Nuovo--Museo Chiaramonti--The\r\n     Belvedere--Gallery of Statues--Hall of Busts--Sala delle Muse--Sala\r\n     Rotonda--Sala a Croce Greca--Galleria dei Candelabri--Galleria\r\n     degli Arazzi--Library--Appartamenti Borgia--Etruscan\r\n     Museum--Egyptian Museum--Gardens--Villa Pia--Loggie--Stanze--Chapel\r\n     of S.

Onofrio and the Monte Mario is\r\nbelieved to have been a site of Etruscan divination.\r\n\r\n    \"Fauni vatesque canebant.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ennius._\r\n\r\nHence the name, which is now only used in regard to the papal palace and\r\nthe basilica of St. Peter, but which was once applied to the whole\r\ndistrict between the foot of the hill and the Tiber near S. Angelo.\r\n\r\n        \" ... ut paterni\r\n    Fluminis ripæ, simul et jocosa\r\n    Redderet laudes tibi Vaticani\r\n        Montis imago.\"\r\n\r\n    _Horace_, i. _Od._ 20.\r\n\r\nTacitus speaks of the unwholesome air of this quarter. In this district\r\nwas the Circus of Caligula, adjoining the gardens of his mother\r\nAgrippina, decorated by the obelisk which now stands in the front of St.\r\nPeter's.[343] Here Seneca describes that while Caligula was walking by\r\ntorchlight, he amused himself by the slaughter of a number of\r\ndistinguished persons--senators and Roman ladies. Afterwards it became\r\nthe Circus of Nero, who from his adjoining gardens used to watch the\r\nmartyrdom of the Christians[344]--mentioned by Suetonius as \"a race\r\ngiven up to a new and evil superstition\"--and who used their living\r\nbodies, covered with pitch and set on fire, as torches for his nocturnal\r\npromenades.\r\n\r\nThe first residence of the popes at the Vatican was erected by St.\r\nSymmachus (A.D. 498--514) near the forecourt of the old St. Peter's, and\r\nhere Charlemagne is believed to have resided on the occasion of his\r\nseveral visits to Rome during the reigns of Adrian I. (772--795) and Leo\r\nIII. (795--816). This ancient palace having fallen into decay during the\r\ntwelfth century, it was rebuilt in the thirteenth by Innocent III. It\r\nwas greatly enlarged by Nicholas III. (1277--1281), but the Lateran\r\ncontinued to be the papal residence, and the Vatican palace was only\r\nused on state occasions, and for the reception of any foreign sovereigns\r\nvisiting Rome. After the return of the popes from Avignon, the Lateran\r\npalace had fallen into decay, and for the sake of the greater security\r\nafforded by the vicinity of S. Angelo, it was determined to make the\r\npontifical residence at the Vatican, and the first conclave was held\r\nthere in 1378. In order to increase its security, John XXIII.\r\nconstructed the covered passage to S. Angelo in 1410. Nicholas V.\r\n(1447--1455) had the idea of making it the most magnificent palace in\r\nthe world, and of uniting in it all the government offices and dwellings\r\nof the cardinals, but died before he could do more than begin the work.\r\nThe building which he commenced was finished by Alexander VI., and still\r\nexists under the name of Tor di Borgia. In 1473 Sixtus IV. built the\r\nSistine Chapel, and in 1490 \"the Belvedere\" was erected as a separate\r\ngarden-house by Innocent VIII. from designs of Antonio da Pollajuolo.\r\nJulius II., with the aid of Bramante, united this villa to the palace by\r\nmeans of one vast courtyard, and erected the Loggie around the Court of\r\nSt. Damasus; he also laid the foundation of the Vatican Museum in the\r\ngardens of the Belvedere. The Loggie were completed by Leo X.; the Sala\r\nRegia and the Pauline Chapel were built by Paul III. Sixtus V. divided\r\nthe great court of Bramante into two by the erection of the library, and\r\nbegan the present residence of the popes, which was finished by Clement\r\nVIII. (1592--1605). Urban VIII. built the Scala Regia; Clement XIV. and\r\nPius VII., the Museo Pio-Clementino; Pius VII., the Braccio Nuovo; Leo\r\nXII., the picture-gallery; Gregory XVI., the Etruscan Museum; and Pius\r\nIX., the handsome staircase leading to the court of Bramante.\r\n\r\nThe length of the Vatican palace is 1151 English feet; its breadth, 767.\r\nIt has eight grand staircases, twenty courts, and is said to contain\r\n11,000 chambers of different sizes.\r\n\r\n     (The collections in the Vatican may be visited daily with an order\r\n     and at fixed hours, except on Sundays and high festivals.\r\n     Permission to make drawings must be obtained from the maggiordomo.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe principal entrance of the Vatican is at the end of the right\r\ncolonnade of St. Peter's. Hence a door on the right opens upon the\r\nstaircase leading to the Cortile di S. Damaso, and is the nearest way to\r\nthe collections of statues and pictures.\r\n\r\nFollowing the great corridor, and passing on the left the entrance to\r\nthe portico of St. Peter's, we reach the _Scala Regia_, a magnificent\r\nwork of Bernini, formerly guarded by the picturesque Swiss soldiers.\r\nHence we enter the _Sala Regia_, built in the reign of Paul III. by\r\nAntonio di Sangallo, and used as a hall of audience for ambassadors. It\r\nis decorated with frescoes illustrative of the history of the popes.\r\n\r\n     ENTRANCE WALL:\r\n\r\n     Alliance of the Venetians with Paul V. against the Turks, and\r\n     Battle of Lepanto, 1571: _Vasari_.\r\n\r\n     RIGHT WALL:\r\n\r\n     Absolution of the Emperor Henry IV., by Gregory VII.: _Federigo_\r\n     and _Taddeo Zucchero_.\r\n\r\n     LEFT WALL:\r\n\r\n     Massacre of St. Bartholomew: _Vasari_.\r\n\r\n     OPPOSITE WALL, towards the Sala Regia:\r\n\r\n     Return of Gregory XI. from Avignon.\r\n\r\n     Benediction of Frederick Barbarossa by Alexander III., in the\r\n     Piazza of S. Marco: _Giuseppe Porta_.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the entrance of the _Pauline Chapel_ (Cappella Paolina),\r\nalso built (1540) by Antonio di Sangallo for Paul III. Its decorations\r\nare chiefly the work of _Sabbatini_ and _F. Zucchero_, but it contains\r\ntwo frescoes by _Michael Angelo_.\r\n\r\n     \"Two excellent frescoes, executed by Michael Angelo on the side\r\n     walls of the Pauline Chapel, are little cared for, and are so much\r\n     blackened by the smoke of lamps that they are seldom mentioned. The\r\n     Crucifixion of St. Peter, under the large window, is in a most\r\n     unfavourable light, but is distinguished for its grand, severe\r\n     composition. That on the opposite wall--the Conversion of St.\r\n     Paul--is still tolerably distinct. The long train of his soldiers\r\n     is seen ascending in the background. Christ, surrounded by a host\r\n     of angels, bursts upon his sight from the storm-flash. Paul lies\r\n     stretched on the ground--a noble and finely-developed form. His\r\n     followers fly on all sides, or are struck motionless by the\r\n     thunder. The arrangement of the groups is excellent, and some of\r\n     the single figures are very dignified; the composition has,\r\n     moreover, a principle of order and repose, which, in comparison\r\n     with the Last Judgment, places this picture in a very favourable\r\n     light. If there are any traces of old age to be found in these\r\n     works, they are at most discoverable in the execution of\r\n     details.\"--_Kugler_, p. 308.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the approach from the Scala Regia is the _Sistine Chapel_\r\n(Cappella Sistina), built by Bacio Pintelli in 1473 for Sixtus IV. The\r\nlower part of the walls of this wonderful chapel was formerly hung on\r\nfestivals with the tapestries executed from the cartoons of Raphael; the\r\nupper portion is decorated in fresco by the great Florentine masters of\r\nthe fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n     \"It was intended to represent scenes from the life of Moses on one\r\n     side of the chapel, and from the life of Christ on the other, so\r\n     that the old law might be confronted by the new,--the type by the\r\n     typified.\"--_Lanzi._\r\n\r\nThe following is the order of the frescoes, type and anti-*type\r\ntogether:\r\n\r\n     Over the altar--now destroyed to make way for the Last Judgment:\r\n\r\n    1.

The Resurrection: _Domenico\r\n    body of Moses (Jude 9):            | Ghirlandajo_, restored by\r\n    _Cecchino Salviati_.               | _Arrigo Fiamingo_.\r\n\r\nOn the pillars between the windows are the figures of twenty-eight\r\npopes, by _Sandro Botticelli_.\r\n\r\n     \"Vasari says that the two works of Luca Signorelli surpass in\r\n     beauty all those which surround them,--an assertion which is at\r\n     least questionable as far as regards the frescoes of Perugino; but\r\n     with respect to all the rest, the superiority of Signorelli is\r\n     evident, even to the most inexperienced eye. The subject of the\r\n     first picture is the journey of Moses and Zipporah into Egypt: the\r\n     landscape is charming, although evidently ideal; there is great\r\n     depth in the aërial perspective; and in the various groups\r\n     scattered over the different parts of the picture there are female\r\n     forms of such beauty, that they may have afforded models to\r\n     Raphael. The same graceful treatment is also perceptible in the\r\n     representation of the death of Moses, the mournful details of\r\n     which have given scope to the poetical imagination of the artist.\r\n     The varied group to whom Moses has just read the Law for the last\r\n     time, the sorrow of Joshua, who is kneeling before the man of God,\r\n     the charming landscape, with the river Jordan threading its way\r\n     between the mountains, which are made singularly beautiful, as if\r\n     to explain the regrets of Moses when the angel announces to him\r\n     that he will not enter into the promised land--all form a series of\r\n     melancholy scenes perfectly in harmony with one another, the only\r\n     defect being that the whole is crowded into too small a\r\n     space.\"--_Rio. Poetry of Christian Art._\r\n\r\nThe avenue of pictures is a preparation for the surpassing grandeur of\r\nthe ceiling:\r\n\r\n     \"The _ceiling_ of the Sistine Chapel contains the most perfect\r\n     works done by _Michael Angelo_ in his long and active life. Here\r\n     his great spirit appears in its noblest dignity, in its highest\r\n     purity; here the attention is not disturbed by that arbitrary\r\n     display to which his great power not unfrequently seduced him in\r\n     other works. The ceiling forms a flattened arch in its section; the\r\n     central portion, which is a plain surface, contains a series of\r\n     large and small pictures, representing the most important events\r\n     recorded in the book of Genesis--the Creation and Fall of Man, with\r\n     its immediate consequences. In the large triangular compartments at\r\n     the springing of the vault, are sitting figures of the prophets and\r\n     sibyls, as the foretellers of the coming of the Saviour. In the\r\n     soffits of the recesses between these compartments, and in the\r\n     arches underneath, immediately above the windows, are the ancestors\r\n     of the Virgin, the series leading the mind directly to the Saviour.\r\n     The external connection of these numerous representations is formed\r\n     by an architectural framework of peculiar composition, which\r\n     encloses the single subjects, tends to make the principal masses\r\n     conspicuous, and gives to the whole an appearance of that solidity\r\n     and support so necessary, but so seldom attended to, in soffit\r\n     decorations, which may be considered as if suspended. A great\r\n     number of figures are also connected with the framework; those in\r\n     unimportant situations are executed in the colour of stone or\r\n     bronze; in the more important, in natural colours. These serve to\r\n     support the architectural forms, to fill up and to connect the\r\n     whole. They may be best described as the living and embodied\r\n     _genii_ of architecture. It required the unlimited power of an\r\n     architect, sculptor, and painter, to conceive a structural whole of\r\n     so much grandeur, to design the decorative figures with the\r\n     significant repose required by the sculpturesque character, and\r\n     yet to preserve their subordination to the principal subjects, and\r\n     to keep the latter in the proportions and relations best adapted to\r\n     the space to be filled.\"--_Kugler_, p. 301.\r\n\r\nThe pictures from the Old Testament, beginning from the altar, are:\r\n\r\n    1. The Separation of Light and Darkness.\r\n    2. The Creation of the Sun and Moon.\r\n    3. The Creation of Trees and Plants.\r\n    4. The Creation of Adam.\r\n    5. The Creation of Eve.\r\n    6. The Fall and the Expulsion from Paradise.\r\n    7. The Sacrifice of Noah.\r\n    8. The Deluge.\r\n    9. The Intoxication of Noah.\r\n\r\n     \"The scenes from Genesis are the most sublime representations of\r\n     these subjects;--the Creating Spirit is unveiled before us. The\r\n     peculiar type which the painter has here given of the form of the\r\n     Almighty Father has been frequently imitated by his followers, and\r\n     even by Raphael, but has been surpassed by none. Michael Angelo has\r\n     represented him in majestic flight, sweeping through the air,\r\n     surrounded by _genii_, partly supporting, partly borne along with\r\n     him, covered by his floating drapery; they are the distinct\r\n     syllables, the separate virtues of his creating word. In the first\r\n     (large) compartment we see him with extended hands, assigning to\r\n     the sun and moon their respective paths. In the second, he awakens\r\n     the first man to life. Adam lies stretched on the verge of the\r\n     earth, in the act of raising himself; the Creator touches him with\r\n     the point of his finger, and appears thus to endow him with feeling\r\n     and life. This picture displays a wonderful depth of thought in the\r\n     composition, and the utmost elevation and majesty in the general\r\n     treatment and execution. The third subject is not less important,\r\n     representing the Fall of Man and his Expulsion from Paradise. The\r\n     tree of knowledge stands in the midst, the serpent (the upper part\r\n     of the body being that of a woman) is twined around the stem; she\r\n     bends down towards the guilty pair, who are in the act of plucking\r\n     the forbidden fruit. The figures are nobly graceful, particularly\r\n     that of Eve. Close to the serpent hovers the angel with the sword,\r\n     ready to drive the fallen beings out of Paradise. In this double\r\n     action, this union of two separate moments, there is something\r\n     peculiarly poetic and significant: it is guilt and punishment in\r\n     one picture. The sudden and lightning-like appearance of the\r\n     avenging angel behind the demon of darkness has a most impressive\r\n     effect.\"--_Kugler_, p. 304.\r\n\r\n     \"It was the seed of Eve that was to bruise the serpent's head.\r\n     Hence it is that Michael Angelo made the Creation of Eve the\r\n     central subject on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. He had the\r\n     good taste to suggest, and yet to avoid, that literal rendering of\r\n     the biblical story which in the ruder representations borders on\r\n     the grotesque, and which Milton, with all his pomp of words, could\r\n     scarcely idealise.\"--_Mrs. Jameson, Hist. of Our Lord._\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the ceiling is divided into triangles occupied by\r\nthe Prophets and Sibyls in solemn contemplation, accompanied by angels\r\nand genii. Beginning from the left of the entrance, their order is,--\r\n\r\n                     1. Jonah.\r\n    2. Jeremiah.         |  7. Sibylla Libyca.\r\n    3. Sibylla Persica.  |  8. Daniel.\r\n    4. Ezekiel.          |  9. Sibylla Cumæa.\r\n    5. Sibylla Erythræa. | 10. Isaiah.\r\n    6. Joel.             | 11. Sibylla Delphica.\r\n                   12. Zachariah.\r\n\r\n     \"The prophets and sibyls in the triangular compartments of the\r\n     curved portion of the ceiling are the largest figures in the whole\r\n     work; these, too, are among the most wonderful forms that modern\r\n     art has called into life. They are all represented seated, employed\r\n     with books or rolled manuscripts; genii stand near, or behind them.\r\n     These mighty beings sit before us pensive, meditative, inquiring,\r\n     or looking upwards with inspired countenances. Their forms and\r\n     movements, indicated by the grand lines and masses of the drapery,\r\n     are majestic and dignified. We see in them beings, who, while they\r\n     feel and bear the sorrows of a corrupt and sinful world, have power\r\n     to look for consolation into the secrets of the future. Yet the\r\n     greatest variety prevails in the attitudes and expression--each\r\n     figure is full of individuality. Zacharias is an aged man, busied\r\n     in calm and circumspect investigation; Jeremiah is bowed down\r\n     absorbed in thought--the thought of deep and bitter grief; Ezekiel\r\n     turns with hasty movement to the genius next to him, who points\r\n     upwards, with joyful expectation, &c. The sibyls are equally\r\n     characteristic: the Persian--a lofty, majestic woman, very aged;\r\n     the Erythræan--full of power, like the warrior goddess of wisdom;\r\n     the Delphic--like Cassandra, youthfully soft and graceful, but\r\n     with strength to bear the awful seriousness of\r\n     revelation.\"--_Kugler_, p. 304.\r\n\r\n     \"The belief of the Roman Catholic Church in the testimony of the\r\n     Sibyl is shown by the well-known hymn, said to have been composed\r\n     by Pope Innocent III. at the close of the thirteenth century,\r\n     beginning with the verse:--\r\n\r\n    'Dies iræ, dies illa,\r\n    Solvet sæclum in favilla,\r\n    Teste David cum Sibylla.'\r\n\r\n     It may be inferred that this hymn, admitted into the liturgy of the\r\n     Roman Church, gave sanction to the adoption of the Sibyls into\r\n     Christian art. They are seen from this time accompanying the\r\n     prophets and apostles in the cyclical decorations of the church....\r\n     But the highest honour that art has rendered to the Sibyls has been\r\n     by the hand of Michael Angelo, on the ceiling of the Sistine\r\n     Chapel. Here, in the conception of a mysterious order of women,\r\n     placed above and without all considerations of the graceful or the\r\n     individual, the great master was peculiarly in his element. They\r\n     exactly fitted his standard of art, not always sympathetic, nor\r\n     comprehensible to the average human mind, of which the grand in\r\n     form and the abstract in expression, were the first and last\r\n     conditions. In this respect, the Sibyls on the Sistine Chapel\r\n     ceiling are more Michael Angelesque than their companions the\r\n     Prophets. For these, while types of the highest monumental\r\n     treatment, are yet men, while the Sibyls belong to a distinct class\r\n     of beings, who convey the impression of the very obscurity in which\r\n     their history is wrapt--creatures who have lived far from the\r\n     abodes of men, who are alike devoid of the expression of feminine\r\n     sweetness, human sympathy, or sacramental beauty; who are neither\r\n     Christians nor Jewesses, Witches nor Graces, yet living, grand,\r\n     beautiful, and true, according to laws revealed to the great\r\n     Florentine genius only. Thus their figures may be said to be\r\n     unique, as the offspring of a peculiar sympathy between the\r\n     master's mind and his subject. To this sympathy may be ascribed the\r\n     prominence and size given them--both Prophets and Sibyls--as\r\n     compared to their usual relation to the subjects they environ. They\r\n     sit here in twelve throne-like niches, more like presiding deities,\r\n     each wrapt in self-contemplation, than as tributary witnesses to\r\n     the truth and omnipotence of Him they are intended to announce.\r\n     Thus they form a gigantic framework round the subjects of the\r\n     Creation, of which the birth of Eve, as the type of the Nativity,\r\n     is the intentional centre. For some reason, the twelve figures are\r\n     not Prophets and Sibyls alternately--there being only five Sibyls\r\n     to seven Prophets--so that the Prophets come together at one\r\n     angle. Books and scrolls are given indiscriminately to them.\r\n\r\n     \"The Sibylla Persica, supposed to be the oldest of the sisterhood,\r\n     holds the book close to her eyes, as if from dimness of sight,\r\n     which fact, contradicted as it is by a frame of obviously Herculean\r\n     strength, gives a mysterious intentness to the action.\r\n\r\n     \"The Sibylla Libyca, of equally powerful proportions, but less\r\n     closely draped, is grandly wringing herself to lift a massive\r\n     volume from a height above her head on to her knees.\r\n\r\n     \"The Sibylla Cumana, also aged, and with her head covered, is\r\n     reading with her volume at a distance from her eyes.\r\n\r\n     \"The Sibylla Delphica, with waving hair escaping from her turban,\r\n     is a beautiful young being--the most human of all--gazing into\r\n     vacancy or futurity. She holds a scroll.\r\n\r\n     \"The Sibylla Erythræa, grand bare-headed creature, sits reading\r\n     intently with crossed legs, about to turn over her book.\r\n\r\n     \"The Prophets are equally grand in structure, and though, as we\r\n     have said, not more than men, yet they are the only men that could\r\n     well bear the juxtaposition with their stupendous female\r\n     colleagues. Ezekiel, between Erythræa and Persica, has a scroll in\r\n     his hand that hangs by his side, just cast down, as he turns\r\n     eagerly to listen to some voice.\r\n\r\n     \"Jeremiah, a magnificent figure, sits with elbow on knee, and head\r\n     on hand, wrapt in the meditation appropriate to one called to utter\r\n     lamentation and woe. He has neither book nor scroll.\r\n\r\n     \"Jonah is also without either. His position is strained and\r\n     ungraceful--looking upwards, and apparently remonstrating with the\r\n     Almighty upon the destruction of the gourd, a few leaves of which\r\n     are seen above him. His hands are placed together with a strange\r\n     and trivial action, supposed to denote the counting on his fingers\r\n     the number of days he was in the fish's belly. A formless marine\r\n     monster is seen at his side.\r\n\r\n     \"Daniel has a book on his lap, with one hand on it. He is young,\r\n     and a piece of lion's skin seems to allude to his history.\"--_Lady\r\n     Eastlake, Hist. of Our Lord_, i. 248.\r\n\r\nIn the recesses between the prophets and sibyls are a series of lovely\r\nfamily groups representing the Genealogy of the Virgin, and expressive\r\nof calm expectation of the future. The four corners of the ceiling\r\ncontain groups illustrative of the power of the Lord displayed in the\r\nespecial deliverances of his chosen people.\r\n\r\nNear the altar are:\r\n\r\n    _Right._--The deliverance of the Israelites by the brazen serpent.\r\n    _Left._--The execution of Haman.\r\n\r\nNear the entrance are:\r\n\r\n    _Right._--Judith and Holofernes.\r\n    _Left._--David and Goliath.\r\n\r\nIt was when Michael Angelo was already in his sixtieth year that Clement\r\nVII. formed the idea of effacing the three pictures of Perugino at the\r\nend of the chapel, and employing him to paint the vast fresco of _The\r\nLast Judgment_ in their place. It occupied the artist for seven years,\r\nand was finished in 1541 when Paul III. was on the throne. To induce him\r\nto pursue his work with application, Paul III. went himself to his house\r\nattended by ten cardinals; \"an honour,\" says Lanzi, \"unique in the\r\nannals of art.\" The pope wished that the picture should be painted in\r\noil, to which he was persuaded by Sebastian del Piombo, but Michael\r\nAngelo refused to employ anything but fresco, saying that oil-painting\r\nwas work for women and for idle and lazy persons.\r\n\r\n     \"In the upper half of the picture we see the Judge of the world,\r\n     surrounded by the apostles and patriarchs; beyond these, on one\r\n     side, are the martyrs; on the other, the saints, and a numerous\r\n     host of the blessed. Above, under the two arches of the vault, two\r\n     groups of angels bear the instruments of the passion. Below the\r\n     Saviour another group of angels holding the book of life sound the\r\n     trumpets to awaken the dead. On the right is represented the\r\n     resurrection; and higher, the ascension of the blessed. On the\r\n     left, hell, and the fall of the condemned, who audaciously strive\r\n     to press to heaven.\r\n\r\n     \"The day of wrath ('dies iræ') is before us--the day, of which the\r\n     old hymn says,--\r\n\r\n    'Quantus tremor est futurus,\r\n    Quando judex est venturus\r\n    Cuncta stricte discussurus.'\r\n\r\n     The Judge turns in wrath towards the condemned and raises his right\r\n     hand, with an expression of rejection and condemnation; beside him\r\n     the Virgin veils herself with her drapery, and turns, with a\r\n     countenance full of anguish, toward the blessed. The martyrs, on\r\n     the left, hold up the instruments and proofs of their martyrdom, in\r\n     accusation of those who had occasioned their temporal death: these\r\n     the avenging angels drive from the gates of heaven, and fulfil the\r\n     sentence pronounced against them. Trembling and anxious, the dead\r\n     rise slowly, as if still fettered by the weight of an earthly\r\n     nature; the pardoned ascend to the blessed; a mysterious horror\r\n     pervades even their hosts--no joy, nor peace, nor blessedness, are\r\n     to be found here.\r\n\r\n     \"It must be admitted that the artist has laid a stress on this view\r\n     of his subject, and this has produced an unfavourable effect upon\r\n     the upper half of his picture. We look in vain for the glory of\r\n     heaven, for beings who bear the stamp of divine holiness, and\r\n     renunciation of human weakness; everywhere we meet with the\r\n     expression of human passion, of human efforts. We see no choir of\r\n     solemn, tranquil forms, no harmonious unity of clear, grand lines,\r\n     produced by ideal draperies; instead of these, we find a confused\r\n     crowd of the most varied movements, naked bodies in violent\r\n     attitudes, unaccompanied by any of the characteristics made sacred\r\n     by holy tradition. Christ, the principal figure of the whole, wants\r\n     every attribute but that of the Judge: no expression of divine\r\n     majesty reminds us that it is the Saviour who exercises this\r\n     office. The upper part of the composition is in many parts heavy,\r\n     notwithstanding the masterly boldness of the drawing; confused, in\r\n     spite of the separation of the principal and accessory groups;\r\n     capricious, notwithstanding a grand arrangement of the whole. But,\r\n     granting for a moment that these defects exist, still this upper\r\n     portion, as a whole, has a very impressive effect, and, at the\r\n     great distance from which it is seen, some of the defects alluded\r\n     to are less offensive to the eye. The lower half deserves the\r\n     highest praise. In these groups, from the languid resuscitation and\r\n     upraising of the pardoned, to the despair of the condemned, every\r\n     variety of expression, anxiety, anguish, rage, and despair, is\r\n     powerfully delineated. In the convulsive struggles of the condemned\r\n     with the evil demons, the most passionate energy displays itself,\r\n     and the extraordinary skill of the artist here finds its most\r\n     appropriate exercise. A peculiar tragic grandeur pervades alike the\r\n     beings who are given up to despair and their hellish tormentors.\r\n     The representation of all that is fearful, far from being\r\n     repulsive, is thus invested with that true moral dignity which is\r\n     so essential a condition in the higher aims of art.\"--_Kugler_, p.\r\n     308.\r\n\r\n     \"The Last Judgment is now more valuable as a school of design than\r\n     as a fine painting, and it will be sought more for the study of the\r\n     artist, than the delight of the amateur. Beautiful it is not--but\r\n     it is sublime;--sublime in conception, and astonishing in\r\n     execution. Still, I believe, there are few who do not feel that it\r\n     is a labour rather than a pleasure to look at it. Its blackened\r\n     surface--its dark and dingy sameness of colouring--the obscurity\r\n     which hangs over it--the confusion and multitude of naked figures\r\n     which compose it--their unnatural position, suspended in the air,\r\n     and the sameness of form and attitude, confound and bewilder the\r\n     senses. These were, perhaps, defects inseparable from the subject,\r\n     although it was one admirably calculated to call forth the powers\r\n     of Michael Angelo. To merit in colouring it has confessedly no\r\n     pretensions, and I think it is also deficient in expression--that\r\n     in the conflicting passions, hopes, fears, remorse, despair, and\r\n     transport, that must agitate the breasts of so many thousands in\r\n     that awful moment, there was room for powerful expression which we\r\n     do not see here. But it is faded and defaced; the touches of\r\n     immortal genius are lost for ever; and from what it is, we can form\r\n     but a faint idea of what it was. Its defects daily become more\r\n     glaring--its beauties vanish; and, could the spirit of its great\r\n     author behold the mighty work upon which he spent the unremitting\r\n     labour of seven years, with what grief and mortification would he\r\n     gaze upon it now.\r\n\r\n     \"It may be fanciful, but it seems to me that in this, and in every\r\n     other of Michael Angelo's works, you may see that the ideas,\r\n     beauties, and peculiar excellences of statuary, were ever present\r\n     to his mind; that they are the conceptions of a sculptor embodied\r\n     in painting.\r\n\r\n     \" ...St. Catharine, in a green gown, and somebody else in a blue\r\n     one, are supremely hideous. Paul IV., in an unfortunate fit of\r\n     prudery, was seized with the resolution of whitewashing over the\r\n     whole of the Last Judgment, in order to cover the scandal of a few\r\n     naked female figures. With difficulty was he prevented from utterly\r\n     destroying the grandest painting in the world, but he could not be\r\n     dissuaded from ordering these poor women to be clothed in this\r\n     unbecoming drapery. Daniele da Volterra, whom he employed in this\r\n     office (in the lifetime of Michael Angelo), received, in\r\n     consequence, the name of Il Braghettone (the\r\n     breeches-maker).\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nMichael Angelo avenged himself upon Messer Biagio da Cesena, master of\r\nthe ceremonies, who first suggested the indelicacy of the naked figures\r\nto the pope, by introducing him in hell, as Midas, with ass's ears. When\r\nCesena begged Paul IV. to cause this figure to be obliterated, the pope\r\nsarcastically replied, \"I might have released you from purgatory, but\r\nover hell I have no power.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Michel-Ange est extraordinaire, tandis qu'Orcagna[345] est\r\n     religieux. Leurs compositions se résument dans les deux Christs qui\r\n     jugent. L'un est un bourreau qui foudroie, l'autre est un monarque\r\n     qui condamne en montrant la plaie sacrée de son côté pour justifier\r\n     sa sentence.\"--_Cartier, Vie du Père Angelico._\r\n\r\n     \"The Apostles in Michael Angelo's Last Judgment stand on each side\r\n     of the Saviour, who is not, here, Saviour and Redeemer, but\r\n     inexorable Judge. They are grandly and artificially grouped, all\r\n     without any drapery whatever, with forms and attitudes which recall\r\n     an assemblage of Titans holding a council of war, rather than the\r\n     glorified companions of Christ.\"--_Jameson's Sacred and Legendary\r\n     Art_, i. 179.\r\n\r\nThe Sistine Chapel is associated in the minds of all Roman sojourners\r\nwith the great ceremonies of the Church, but especially with the\r\nMiserere of Passion Week.\r\n\r\n     \"On Wednesday afternoon began the Miserere in the Sistine\r\n     Chapel.... The old cardinals entered in their magnificent\r\n     violet-coloured velvet cloaks, with their white ermine capes; and\r\n     seated themselves side by side, in a great half-circle, within the\r\n     barrier, whilst the priests who had carried their trains seated\r\n     themselves at their feet. By the little side door of the altar the\r\n     holy father now entered in his purple mantle and silver tiara. He\r\n     ascended his throne. Bishops swung the vessels of incense around\r\n     him, whilst young priests, in scarlet vestments, knelt, with\r\n     lighted torches in their hands, before him and the high altar.\r\n\r\n     \"The reading of the lessons began.[346] But it was impossible to\r\n     keep the eyes fixed on the lifeless letters of the missal--they\r\n     raised themselves, with the thoughts, to the vast universe which\r\n     Michael Angelo had breathed forth in colours upon the ceiling and\r\n     the walls. I contemplated his mighty sibyls and wondrously glorious\r\n     prophets, every one of them a subject for a painting. My eyes drank\r\n     in the magnificent processions, the beautiful groups of angels;\r\n     they were not to me painted pictures, all stood living before me.\r\n     The rich tree of knowledge, from which Eve gave the fruit to Adam:\r\n     the Almighty God, who floated over the waters, not borne up by\r\n     angels, as the older masters had represented him--no, the company\r\n     of angels rested upon him and his fluttering garments. It is true I\r\n     had seen these pictures before, but never as now had they seized\r\n     upon me. My excited state of mind, the crowd of people, perhaps\r\n     even the lyric of my thoughts, made me wonderfully alive to\r\n     poetical impressions; and many a poet's heart has felt as mine did!\r\n\r\n     \"The bold foreshortenings, the determinate force with which every\r\n     figure steps forward, is amazing, and carries one quite away! It is\r\n     a spiritual Sermon on the Mount in colour and form. Like Raphael,\r\n     we stand in astonishment before the power of Michael Angelo. Every\r\n     prophet is a Moses like that which he formed in marble. What giant\r\n     forms are those which seize upon our eye and our thoughts as we\r\n     enter! But, when intoxicated with this view, let us turn our eyes\r\n     to the background of the chapel, whose whole wall is a high altar\r\n     of art and thought. The great chaotic picture, from the floor to\r\n     the roof, shows itself there like a jewel, of which all the rest is\r\n     only the setting. We see there the Last Judgment.\r\n\r\n     \"Christ stands in judgment upon the clouds, and the apostles and\r\n     his mother stretch forth their hands beseeching for the poor human\r\n     race. The dead raise the gravestones under which they have lain;\r\n     blessed spirits float upwards, adoring, to God, whilst the abyss\r\n     seizes its victims. Here one of the ascending spirits seeks to save\r\n     his condemned brother, whom the abyss already embraces in its snaky\r\n     folds. The children of despair strike their clenched fists upon\r\n     their brows and sink into the depths! In bold foreshortening, float\r\n     and tumble whole legions between heaven and earth. The sympathy of\r\n     the angels; the expression of lovers who meet; the child that, at\r\n     the sound of the trumpet, clings to the mother's breast, is so\r\n     natural and beautiful, that one believes oneself to be among those\r\n     who are waiting for judgment. Michael Angelo has expressed in\r\n     colours what Dante saw and has sung to the generations of the\r\n     earth.\r\n\r\n     \"The descending sun, at that moment, threw his last beams in\r\n     through the uppermost windows. Christ, and the blessed around him,\r\n     were strongly lighted up; whilst the lower part, where the dead\r\n     arose, and the demons thrust their boat, laden with damned, from\r\n     shore, were almost in darkness.\r\n\r\n     \"Just as the sun went down the last Psalm was ended, and the last\r\n     light which now remained was extinguished, and the whole\r\n     picture-world vanished in the gloom from before me; but, in that\r\n     same moment, burst forth music and singing. That which colour had\r\n     bodily revealed arose now in sound: the day of judgment, with its\r\n     despair and its exultation, resounded above us.\r\n\r\n     \"The father of the Church, stripped of his papal pomp, stood before\r\n     the altar, and prayed to the holy cross; and upon the wings of the\r\n     trumpet resounded the trembling quire, 'Populus meus, quid feci\r\n     tibi!' Soft angel notes rose above the deep song, tones which\r\n     ascended not from a human breast: it was not a man's nor a woman's:\r\n     it belonged to the world of spirits: it was like the weeping of\r\n     angels dissolved in melody.\"'--_Anderson's Improvisatore._\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Le _Miserere_, c'est-à-dire, _ayez pitié de nous_, est un psaume\r\n     composé de versets qui se chantent alternativement d'une manière\r\n     très-différente.

It is a lonely\r\nlife, as the dread of an accusation of nepotism has prevented any of the\r\nlater popes from having any of their family with them, and etiquette\r\nalways obliges them to dine, &c., alone.

The last door on the left of\r\nthis gallery is the entrance to the Library.\r\n\r\nSeparated from this by an iron gate, which is locked, except on Mondays,\r\nbut opened by a custode (fee 50 c.), is the Museo Chiaramonti; but the\r\nvisitors should first enter, on the left,\r\n\r\nThe _Braccio-Nuovo_, built under Pius VII. in 1817, by Raphael Stern, a\r\nfine hall, 250 feet long, filled with gems of sculpture. Perhaps most\r\nworth attention are (the _chefs d'œuvre_ being marked with an\r\nasterisk):\r\n\r\n     _Right._--\r\n\r\n     5. *Caryatide.\r\n\r\n     This statue was admirably restored by Thorwaldsen. Its Greek origin\r\n     is undoubted, and it is supposed to be the missing figure from the\r\n     Erechtheum at Athens.\r\n\r\n     \"Quand une fille des premières familles n'avait pour vêtement,\r\n     comme celle-ci, qu'une chemise et par-dessus une demi-chemise;\r\n     quand elle avait l'habitude de porter des vases sur sa tête, et par\r\n     suite de se tenir droite; quand pour toute toilette elle\r\n     retroussait ses cheveux ou les laissait tomber en boucles; quand le\r\n     visage n'était pas plissé par les mille petites grâces et les mille\r\n     petites préoccupations bourgeoises, une femme pouvait avoir la\r\n     tranquille attitude de cette statue. Aujourd'hui il en reste un\r\n     débris dans les paysannes des environs qui portent leurs corbeilles\r\n     sur la tête, mais elles sont gâtées par le travail et les haillons.\r\n     Le sein paraît sous la chemise; la tunique colle et visiblement\r\n     n'est qu'un linge; on voit la forme de la jambe qui casse l'étoffe\r\n     au genou; les pieds apparaissent nus dans les sandales. Rien ne\r\n     peut rendre le sérieux naturel du visage. Certainement, si on\r\n     pouvait revoir la personne réelle avec ses bras blancs, ses cheveux\r\n     noirs, sous la lumière du soleil, les genoux plieraient, comme\r\n     devant une déesse, de respect et de plaisir.\"--_Taine, Voyage en\r\n     Italie._\r\n\r\n     8. Commodus.\r\n\r\n     \"La statue de Commode est très curieuse par le costume. Il tient à\r\n     la main une lance, il a des espèces de bottes: tout cela est du\r\n     chasseur, enfin il porte la tunique à manches dont parle Dion\r\n     Cassius, et qui était son costume d'amphithéâtre.\"--_Ampère, Emp._\r\n     ii. 246.\r\n\r\n     9. Colossal head of a Dacian, from the Forum of Trajan.\r\n\r\n     11. Silenus and the infant Bacchus.\r\n\r\n     This is a copy from the Greek, of which there were several\r\n     replicas. One, formerly in the Villa Borghese, is now at Paris. The\r\n     original group is described by Pliny, who says that the name of the\r\n     sculptor was lost even in his time.

The cuirass is covered with small\r\n     figures, in basso-relievo, which, as works of art, are even finer\r\n     than the statue itself, and merit the most careful examination.\r\n     These small figures are, in their way, marvels of art, for the\r\n     wonderful boldness of execution and minuteness of detail shown in\r\n     them. They are almost like cameos, and yet, with all the delicacy\r\n     of finish displayed, there is no mere smoothness of surface. The\r\n     central group is supposed to represent the restoration to Augustus\r\n     by King Phraates of the eagles taken from Crassus and Antony.\r\n     Considerable traces of colour were found on this statue and are\r\n     still discernible.

Winckelmann scarcely thinks anything of it, or at\r\n     any rate does not give it its proper position; but I cannot praise\r\n     it sufficiently. While we were gazing upon the statue, and standing\r\n     a long time beside it, the wife of the custode told us that it was\r\n     once a sacred image, and that the English, who are of that\r\n     religion, still held it in veneration, being in the habit of\r\n     kissing one of its hands, which was certainly quite white, while\r\n     the rest of the statue was of a brownish colour. She added, that a\r\n     lady of this religion had been there a short time before, had\r\n     thrown herself on her knees, and worshipped the statue. Such a\r\n     wonderful action she, as a Christian, could not behold without\r\n     laughter, and fled from the room, for fear of\r\n     exploding.\"--_Goethe._\r\n\r\n     117. Claudius.\r\n\r\n     120. A replica of the Faun of Praxiteles, inferior to that at the\r\n     Capitol.\r\n\r\n     \"Le jeune Satyre qui tient une flûte est trop semblable à celui du\r\n     Capitole pour n'être pas de même une reproduction de l'un des deux\r\n     Satyres isolés de Praxitèle, son Satyre d'Athènes ou son Satyre de\r\n     Mégare; on pourrait croire aussi que le Satyre à la flûte a eu pour\r\n     original le Satyre de Protogène qui, bien que peint dans Rhodes\r\n     assiégée, exprimait le calme le plus profond et qu'on appelait\r\n     _celui qui se repose_ (_anapauomenos_); on pourrait le croire, car\r\n     la statue a toujours une jambe croisée sur l'autre, attitude qui,\r\n     dans le langage de la sculpture antique, désigne le repos. Il ne\r\n     serait pas impossible non plus que Protogène se fût inspiré de\r\n     Praxitèle; mais en ce cas il n'en avait pas reproduit complétement\r\n     le charme, car Apelles, tout en admirant une autre figure de\r\n     Protogène, lui reprochait de manquer de grâce. Or, le Satyre à la\r\n     flûte est très-gracieux; ce qui me porte à croire qu'il vient\r\n     directement de Praxitèle plutôt que de Praxitèle par\r\n     Protogène.\"--_Ampère, Hist.

Head of Neptune, from Ostia.\r\n\r\n     XXX. r. 732. Recumbent Hercules, from Hadrian's Villa.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this gallery is the entrance to the Giardino della Pigna\r\n(described under the Vatican Gardens). Admittance may probably be\r\nobtained from hence for a fee of 50 c. At the top of the short\r\nstaircase, on the left, is the entrance of the Egyptian Museum. Here we\r\nenter the _Museo Pio-Clementino_, founded under Clement XIV., but\r\nchiefly due to the liberality and taste of Pius VI., in whose reign,\r\nhowever, most of the best statues were carried off to Paris, though they\r\nwere restored to Pius VII.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of _1st Vestibule_ is the *Torso Belvidere, found in the\r\nbaths of Caracalla, and sculptured, as is told by a Greek inscription on\r\nits base, by Apollonius, son of Nestor of Athens. It was to this statue\r\nthat Michael-Angelo declared that he owed his power of representing the\r\nhuman form, and in his blind old age he used to be led up to it, that he\r\nmight pass his hands over it, and still enjoy, through touch, the\r\ngrandeur of its lines.\r\n\r\n    \"And dost thou still, thou mass of breathing stone\r\n    (Thy giant limbs to night and chaos hurled),\r\n    Still sit as on the fragment of a world,\r\n    Surviving all, majestic and alone?\r\n    What tho' the Spirits of the North, that swept\r\n    Rome from the earth when in her pomp she slept,\r\n    Smote thee with fury, and thy headless trunk\r\n    Deep in the dust 'mid tower and temple sunk;\r\n    Soon to subdue mankind 'twas thine to rise,\r\n    Still, still unquelled thy glorious energies!\r\n    Aspiring minds, with thee conversing, caught\r\n    Bright revelations of the good they sought;\r\n    By thee that long-lost spell in secret given,\r\n    To draw down gods, and lift the soul to Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n    _Rogers._\r\n\r\n     \"Quelle a été l'original du torse d'Hercule, ce chef-d'œuvre que\r\n     palpait de ses mains intelligentes Michel-Ange aveugle et réduit à\r\n     ne plus voir que par elles? Heyne a pensé que ce pouvait être une\r\n     copie en grand de l'Hercule _Epitrapezios_ de Lysippe, mais par le\r\n     style cette statue me semble antérieure à Lysippe. Cependant on lit\r\n     sur le torse le nom d'Apollonios d'Athènes, fils de Nestor, et la\r\n     forme des lettres ne permet pas de placer cette inscription plus\r\n     haut que le dernier siècle de la République.\r\n\r\n     \"Comment admettre que cette statue, aussi admirée par Winckelmann\r\n     que par Michel-Ange, ce débris auquel on revient après\r\n     l'éblouissement de l'Apollon du Belvidère, pour retrouver une\r\n     sculpture plus mâle et plus simple, un style plus fort et plus\r\n     grand; comment admettre qu'une telle statue soit l'œuvre d'un\r\n     sculpteur inconnu dont Pline ne parle point, ni personne autre dans\r\n     l'antiquité, et qu'elle date d'un temps si éloigné de la grande\r\n     époque de Phidias, quand elle semble y tenir de si près?\r\n\r\n     \" ...

Cornelius\r\nScipio Barbatus, consul B.C. 297. It supports a bust, supposed, upon\r\nslight foundation, to be that of the poet Ennius. Inscriptions from\r\nother tombs of the Scipios are inserted in the neighbouring wall.[347]\r\n\r\n     \"L'épitaphe de Scipion le Barbu semble le résumé d'une oraison\r\n     funèbre; elle s'adresse aux spectateurs: 'Cornélius Scipion\r\n     Barbatus, né d'un père vaillant, homme courageux et prudent, dont\r\n     la beauté égalait la vertu.

Hence there is a lovely view over the city. In the\r\ngarden beneath is a fountain with a curious bronze ship floating in its\r\nbason (see Vatican Gardens).\r\n\r\nAt the end of the _3rd Vestibule_ stands the *Statue of Meleager, with a\r\nboar's head and a dog, supposed to have been begun in Greece by some\r\nfamous sculptor, and finished in Rome (the dog, &c.) by an inferior\r\nworkman.\r\n\r\n     \"Meleager is represented in a position of repose, leaning on his\r\n     spear, the mark of the junction of which, with the plinth, is still\r\n     to be seen. The want of the spear gives the statue the appearance\r\n     of leaning too much to one side, but if you can imagine it\r\n     replaced, you will see that the pose is perfectly and truthfully\r\n     rendered.

From this opens,\r\nbeginning from the right, the--\r\n\r\n_First Cabinet_, containing the Perseus, and the two Boxers--Kreugas and\r\nDamoxenus, by _Canova_.\r\n\r\n_The Second Cabinet_, containing *the Antinous (now called Mercury),\r\nperhaps the most beautiful statue in the world. It was found on the\r\nEsquiline near S. Martino al Monte. It has never been injured by\r\nrestoration, but was broken across the ankles when found, and has been\r\nunskilfully put together.\r\n\r\n     \"Je suis bien tenté de rapporter à un original de Polyclète, qui\r\n     aimait les formes carrées, le Mercure du Belvédère, qui n'est pas\r\n     très-svelte pour un Mercure.

De plus, on sait qu'un Mercure de Polyclète avait été\r\n     apporté à Rome.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 267.\r\n\r\n_Third Cabinet_, of *the Laocoon. This wonderful group was discovered\r\nnear the Sette Sale on the Esquiline in 1506, while Michael-Angelo was\r\nat Rome. The right arm of the father is a terra-cotta restoration, and\r\nis said by Winckelmann to be the work of Bernini; the arms of the sons\r\nare additions by Agostino Cornacchini of Pistoia. There is now no doubt\r\nthat the Laocoon is the group described by Pliny.\r\n\r\n     \"The fame of many sculptors is less diffused, because the number\r\n     employed upon great works prevented their celebrity; for there is\r\n     no one artist to receive the honour of the work, and where there\r\n     are more than one they cannot all obtain an equal fame. Of this the\r\n     Laocoon is an example, which stands in the palace of the emperor\r\n     Titus,--a work which may be considered superior to all others both\r\n     in painting and statuary. The whole group,--the father, the boys,\r\n     and the awful folds of the serpents,--were formed out of a single\r\n     block, in accordance with a vote of the senate, by Agesander,\r\n     Polydorus, and Athenodorus, Rhodian sculptors of the highest\r\n     merit.\"--_Pliny_, lib. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n     \"Les trois sculpteurs rhodiens qui travaillèrent ensemble au\r\n     Laocoon étaient probablement un père et ses deux fils, qui\r\n     exécutèrent l'un la statue du père, et les autres celles des deux\r\n     fils, touchante analogie entre les auteurs et l'ouvrage.\r\n\r\n     \"Les auteurs du Laocoon étaient Rhodiens, ce peuple auquel, dit\r\n     Pindare, Minerve a donné de l'emporter sur tous les mortels par le\r\n     travail habile de leurs mains, et dont les rues étaient garnies de\r\n     figures vivantes qui semblaient marcher. Or, le grand éclat, la\r\n     grande puissance de Rhodes, appartiennent surtout à l'époque qui\r\n     suivit la mort d'Alexandre. Après qu'elle se fût délivrée du joug\r\n     macédonien, presque toujours alliée de Rome, Rhodes fut florissante\r\n     par le commerce, les armes et la liberté, jusqu'au jour on elle\r\n     eut embrassé le parti de César; Cassius prit d'assaut la capitale\r\n     de l'île et dépouilla ses temples de tous leurs ornements. Le coup\r\n     fut mortel à la république de Rhodes, qui depuis ne s'en releva\r\n     plus.\r\n\r\n     \"C'est avant cette fatale époque, dans l'époque de la prospérité\r\n     rhodienne, entre Alexandre et César, que se place le grand\r\n     développement de l'art comme de la puissance des Rhodiens, et qu'on\r\n     est conduit naturellement à placer la création d'un chef-d'œuvre\r\n     tel que le Laocoon.\r\n\r\n     \"Pline dit que les trois statues dont se compose le groupe étaient\r\n     d'un seul morceau, et ce groupe est formé de plusieurs, on en a\r\n     compté jusqu'à six. Ceci semblerait faire croire que nous n'avons\r\n     qu'une copie, mais j'avoue ne pas attacher une grande importance à\r\n     cette indication de Pline, compilateur plus érudit qu'observateur\r\n     attentif. Michel-Ange, dit-on, remarqua le premier que le Laocoon\r\n     n'était pas d'un seul morceau; Pline a très-bien pu ne pas s'en\r\n     apercevoir plus que nous et répéter de confiance une assertion\r\n     inexacte.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 382, 385, 387.\r\n\r\n    ... \"Turning to the Vatican, go see\r\n    Laocoon's torture dignifying pain--\r\n    A father's love and mortal's agony\r\n    With an immortal's patience blending, vain\r\n    The struggle; vain against the coiling strain\r\n    And gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,\r\n    The old man's clench; the long envenom'd chain\r\n    Rivets the living links,--the enormous asp\r\n    Enforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp.\"\r\n\r\n    _Childe Harold._\r\n\r\n     \"The circumstance of the two sons being so much smaller than the\r\n     father, has been criticised by some, but this seems to have been\r\n     necessary to the harmony of the composition. The same apparent\r\n     disproportion exists between Niobe and her children, in the\r\n     celebrated group at Florence, supposed to be by Scopas. The raised\r\n     arms of the three figures are all restorations, as are some\r\n     portions of the serpents. Originally, the raised hands of the old\r\n     man rested on his head, and the traces of the junction are clearly\r\n     discernible. For this we have also the evidence of an antique gem,\r\n     on which it is thus engraved. This work was found in the baths (?)\r\n     of Titus, in the reign of Julius II., by a certain Felix de Fredis,\r\n     who received half the revenue of the gabella of the Porta San\r\n     Giovanni as a reward, and whose epitaph, in the church of Ara\r\n     Cœli, records the fact.\"--_Shakspere Wood._\r\n\r\n     \"Il y avait dans la vie, au seizième siècle, je ne sais qu'elle\r\n     excitation fébrile, quelle aspiration vers le beau, vers l'inconnu,\r\n     qui disposait les esprits à l'enthousiasme.... Félix de Frédis fut\r\n     gratifié d'une part dans les revenus de la porte de Saint Jean de\r\n     Latran, pour avoir trouvé le groupe du Laocoon, et, lorsque l'ordre\r\n     fut donné de transporter au Belvédère le Laocoon, l'Apollon, la\r\n     Vénus, Rome entière s'émut, on jetait des fleurs au marbre, on\r\n     battait des mains; depuis les thermes de Titus jusqu'au Vatican, le\r\n     Laocoon fut porté en triomphe; et Sadolet chantait sur le mode\r\n     virgilien que durent reconnaître les échos de l'Esquilin et du\r\n     palais d'Auguste.\"--_Gournerie, Rome Chrétienne._\r\n\r\n     \"I felt the Laocoon very powerfully, though very quietly; an\r\n     immortal agony, with a strange calmness diffused through it, so\r\n     that it resembles the vast rage of the sea, calm on account of its\r\n     immensity; or the tumult of Niagara, which does not seem to be\r\n     tumult, because it keeps pouring on for ever and ever.\"\r\n\r\n     \"It is a type of human beings, struggling with an inexplicable\r\n     trouble, and entangled in a complication which they cannot free\r\n     themselves from by their own efforts, and out of which Heaven alone\r\n     can help them.\"--_Hawthorne, Notes on Italy._\r\n\r\n_The Fourth Cabinet_ contains *the Apollo Belvedere, found in the\r\nsixteenth century at Porto d'Anzio (Antium), and purchased by Julius II.\r\nfor the Belvedere Palace, which was at that time a garden pavilion\r\nseparated from the rest of the Vatican, and used as a museum of\r\nsculpture. It is now decided that this statue, beautiful as it is, is\r\nnot the original work of a Greek sculptor, but a copy, probably from the\r\nbronze of Calamides, which represented Apollo, as the defender of the\r\ncity, and which was erected at Athens after the cessation of a great\r\nplague. Four famous statues of Apollo are mentioned by Pliny as existing\r\nat Rome in his time, but this is not one of them.\r\n\r\n    \"Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,\r\n    The God of life, and poesy, and light--\r\n    The Sun in human limbs array'd, and brow\r\n    All radiant from his triumph in the fight;\r\n    The shaft hath just been shot--the arrow bright\r\n    With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye\r\n    And nostril beautiful disdain, and might,\r\n    And majesty flash their full lightnings by,\r\n    Developing in that one glance the Deity.\"\r\n\r\n    _Childe Harold._\r\n\r\n      \"Bright kindling with a conqueror's stem delight,\r\n    His keen eye tracks the arrow's fateful flight:\r\n    Burns his indignant cheek with vengeful fire,\r\n    And his lip quivers with insulting ire:\r\n    Firm fix'd his tread, yet light, as when on high\r\n    He walks th' impalpable and pathless sky:\r\n    The rich luxuriance of his hair, confined\r\n    In graceful ringlets, wantons on the wind,\r\n    That lifts in sport his mantle's drooping fold,\r\n    Proud to display that form of faultless mould.\r\n       Mighty Ephesian! with an eagle's flight\r\n    Thy proud soul mounted through the fields of light,\r\n    View'd the bright conclave of Heaven's blest abode,\r\n    And the cold marble leapt to life a god:\r\n    Contagious awe through breathless myriads ran,\r\n    And nations bow'd before the work of man.\r\n    For mild he seem'd, as in Elysian bowers,\r\n    Wasting in careless ease the joyous hours;\r\n    Haughty, as bards have sung, with princely sway\r\n    Curbing the fierce flame-breathing steeds of day;\r\n    Beauteous as vision seen in dreamy sleep\r\n    By holy maid on Delphi's haunted steep,\r\n    Mid the dim twilight of the laurel grove,\r\n    Too fair to worship, too divine to love.\"\r\n\r\n    _Henry Hart Milman._\r\n\r\nIn the second portico, between Canova's statues and the Antinous, is\r\n(No. 43) a Venus and Cupid,--interesting because the Venus is a portrait\r\nof Sallustia Barbia Orbiana, wife of Alexander Severus. It was\r\ndiscovered in the fifteenth century, in the ruin near Sta. Croce in\r\nGerusalemme, to which it has given a name. In the third portico, between\r\nthe Antinous and the Laocoon, are two beautiful dogs. Between these we\r\nenter:\r\n\r\nThe _Sala degli Animali_, containing a number of representations of\r\nanimals in marble and alabaster. Perhaps the best is No. 116--two\r\ngreyhounds playing. The statue of Commodus on horseback (No. 139) served\r\nas a model to Bernini for his figure of Constantine in the portico of\r\nSt. Peter's.\r\n\r\n     \"La Salle des Animaux au Vatican est comme un musée de l'école de\r\n     Myron; le naturel parfait qu'il donna à ses représentations\r\n     d'animaux y éclate partout.

In its lunettes are remains\r\nof frescoes by _Pinturicchio_. Beginning on the right, are:\r\n\r\n     248. An armed statue of Claudius Albinus standing on a cippus which\r\n     marked the spot where the body of Caius Cæsar was burnt, inscribed\r\n     C. CÆSAR GERMANICI CÆSARIS HIC CREMATUS EST.\r\n\r\n     250. The *Statue called \"The Genius of the Vatican,\" supposed to be\r\n     a copy from a Cupid of Praxiteles which existed in the Portico of\r\n     Octavia in the time of Pliny. On the back are the holes for the\r\n     metal pins which supported the wings.\r\n\r\n     251. Athlete.\r\n\r\n     253. Triton, from Tivoli.\r\n\r\n     255. Paris.\r\n\r\n     Le Vatican possède une statue de Pâris jugeant les déesses.

Il m'est impossible, il est vrai, de voir dans le Pâris du\r\n     Vatican tout ce que Pline dit du Pâris d'Euphranor. Je ne puis y\r\n     voir que le juge des déesses. L'expression de son visage montre\r\n     qu'il a contemplé la beauté de Vénus, et que le prix va être donné.\r\n     Rien n'annonce l'amant d'Hélène, ni surtout le vainqueur d'Achille;\r\n     mais ce qui était dans l'original aurait pu disparaître de la\r\n     copie.\"--_Ampère, Hist.

Penelope, on a pedestal, with a relief of Bacchus and Ariadne.\r\n\r\n     \"L'attente de Pénélope nous est présente, et, pour ainsi dire, dure\r\n     encore pour nous dans cette expressive Pénélope, dont le torse nous\r\n     a montré un spécimen de l'art grec sous la forme la plus\r\n     ancienne.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rome_, iii. p. 452.\r\n\r\n     264. *Apollo Sauroctonos (killing a lizard), found on the Palatine\r\n     in 1777--a copy of a work of Praxiteles. Several other copies are\r\n     in existence, one in bronze, in the Villa Albani, inferior to this.\r\n     The right arm and the legs above the knees are restorations, well\r\n     executed.\r\n\r\n     \"Apollon presque enfant épie un lézard qui se glisse le long d'un\r\n     arbre.

Amazon, found in thé Villa Mattei, the finest of the three\r\n     Amazons in the Vatican, which are all supposed to be copies from\r\n     the fifty statues of Amazons, which decorated the temple of Diana\r\n     at Ephesus.\r\n\r\n     267. Drunken Satyr.\r\n\r\n     268. Juno, from Otricoli.\r\n\r\n     271, 390. Posidippus and Menander, very fine statues, perfectly\r\n     preserved, owing to their having been kept through the middle ages\r\n     in the church of S. Lorenzo Pane e Perna, where they were\r\n     worshipped under the belief that they were statues of saints, a\r\n     belief which arose from their having metal discs over their heads,\r\n     a practice which prevailed with many Greek statues intended for the\r\n     open air. The marks of the metal pins for these discs may still be\r\n     seen, as well as those for a bronze protection for the feet, to\r\n     prevent their being worn away by the kisses of the faithful,--as on\r\n     the statue of St. Peter at St Peter's.\r\n\r\nBetween these statues we enter:\r\n\r\nThe _Hall of Busts_. Perhaps the best are:\r\n\r\n     278. Augustus, with a wreath of corn.\r\n\r\n     289. Julia Mammæa, mother of Alexander Severus.\r\n\r\n     299. Jupiter-Serapis, in basalt.\r\n\r\n     325. Jupiter.\r\n\r\n     357. Antinous.\r\n\r\n     388. *Roman Senator and his wife, from a tomb.

Nul récit ne pourrait aussi bien que\r\n     ces deux figures transporter au sein des mœurs domestiques de\r\n     Rome; en leur présence on se sent pénétré soi-même d'honnêteté, de\r\n     pudeur et de respect, comme si on était assis au chaste foyer de\r\n     Lucrèce.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iv. 103.\r\n\r\nRe-entering the Gallery of Statues, and following the left wall, are:\r\n\r\n     392. Septimius Severus.\r\n\r\n     393. Girl at a spring?\r\n\r\n     394. Neptune.\r\n\r\n     395. Apollo Citharœdus.\r\n\r\n     396. Wounded Adonis.\r\n\r\n     397. Bacchus, from Hadrian's Villa.\r\n\r\n     398. Macrinus (Imp. 217).\r\n\r\n     399. Æsculapius and Hygeia, from Palestrina.\r\n\r\n     400. Euterpe.\r\n\r\n     401. Mutilated group from the Niobides, found near Porta San Paolo.\r\n\r\n     405. Danaide.\r\n\r\n     406. Copy of the Faun of Praxiteles, very beautiful, but inferior\r\n     to that at the Capitol.\r\n\r\n     422. Head of a fountain, with Bacchanalian Procession.\r\n\r\n(Here is the entrance of the _Gabinetto delle Maschere_, which contains\r\nworks of small importance. It is named from the mosaic upon the floor,\r\nof masks from Hadrian's Villa. It is seldom shown, probably because it\r\ncontains a chair of rosso-antico, called \"Sedia forata,\" found near the\r\nLateran, and supposed to be the famous \"Sella Stercoraria\" used at the\r\ninstallation of the mediæval popes, and associated with the legend of\r\nPope Joan.\r\n\r\n     \"Le Pape élu (Célestine III. 1191) se prosterne devant l'autel\r\n     pendant que l'on chante le Te Deum: puis les Cardinaux Evêques le\r\n     conduisent à son siége derrière l'autel: là ils viennent à ses\r\n     pieds, et il leur donne le baiser de paix. On le mène ensuite à une\r\n     chaise posée devant la portique de la Basilique du Sauveur de\r\n     Latran. Cette chaise était nommée dès lors '_Stercoraria_,'\r\n     parceque elle est percée au fond: mais l'ouverture est petite, et\r\n     les antiquaires jugent que c'étoit pour égouter l'eau, et que cette\r\n     chaise servait à quelque bain.\"--_Fleury, Histoire Ecclésiastique_,\r\n     xv. p. 525.)\r\n\r\n462.

Lucius Verus--on a pedestal which supported the ashes of\r\n     Drusus in the Mausoleum of Augustus.\r\n\r\nFrom the centre of the Sala degli Animali we now enter:\r\n\r\nThe _Sala delle Muse_, adorned with sixteen Corinthian columns from\r\nHadrian's Villa. It is chiefly filled with statues and busts from the\r\nvilla of Cassius at Tivoli. The statues of the Muses and that called\r\nApollo Musagetes (No. 516) are generally attributed to the time of the\r\nAntonines.\r\n\r\n     \"Nous savons que l'Apollon Citharède de Scopas était dans le temple\r\n     d'Apollon Palatin, élevé par Auguste; les médailles, Properce et\r\n     Tibulle, nous apprennent que le dieu s'y voyait revêtu d'une longue\r\n     robe.\r\n\r\n    'Ima videbatur talis illudere palla.'\r\n\r\n    _Tib._ iii. 4, 35.\r\n\r\n    'Pythius in longa carmina veste sonat.'\r\n\r\n    _Prop._ ii. 31, 16.\r\n\r\n     \"Nous ne pouvons donc hésiter à admettre que l'Apollon de la salle\r\n     des Muses au Vatican a eu pour premier original l'Apollon de\r\n     Scopas.\r\n\r\n     \"Nous savons aussi qu'un Apollon de Philiscus et un Apollon de\r\n     Timarchide (celui-ci tenant la lyre), sculpteurs grecs moins\r\n     anciens que Scopas, étaient dans un autre temple d'Apollon, près du\r\n     portique d'Octavie, en compagnie des Muses, comme l'Apollon\r\n     Citharède du Vatican a été trouvé avec celles qui l'entourent\r\n     aujourd'hui dans la salle des Muses. Il est donc vraisemblable que\r\n     cet Apollon est d'après Philiscus ou Timarchide, qui eux-mêmes\r\n     avaient sans doute copié l'Apollon _à la lyre_ de Scopas et\r\n     l'avaient placé au milieu des Muses.\r\n\r\n     \"Apollon est là, ainsi que plus anciennement il avait été\r\n     représenté sur le coffre de Cypsélus, avec cette inscription qui\r\n     conviendrait à la statue du Vatican: 'Alentour est le chœur\r\n     gracieux des Muses, auquel il préside;' et, comme dit Pindare, 'au\r\n     milieu du beau chœur des Muses, Apollon frappe du plectrum d'or\r\n     la lyre aux sept voix.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 292.\r\n\r\nHere we reach the _Sala Rotonda_, built by Pius VI., paved with a mosaic\r\nfound in 1780 in the baths of Otricoli, and containing in its centre a\r\ngrand porphyry vase from the baths of Titus. On either side of the\r\nentrance are colossal heads of Tragedy and Comedy, from Hadrian's Villa.\r\nBeginning from the right are:\r\n\r\n     539. *Bust of Jupiter from Otricoli--the finest extant.\r\n\r\n     540.

However this may be, Hadrian lamented his death\r\n     with extravagant weakness, proclaimed his divinity to the jeering\r\n     Egyptians, and consecrated a temple in his honour.

Jupiter Serapis.\r\n\r\n     550. *The Barberini Juno.\r\n\r\n     551. Claudius.\r\n\r\n     552. Juno Sospita, from Lanuvium. This is the only statue in the\r\n     Vatican of which we can be certain that it was a worshipped idol;\r\n     the sandals of the Tyrrhenian Juno turn up at the end,--no other\r\n     Juno wears these sandals.\r\n\r\n     553. Plotina, wife of Trajan.\r\n\r\n     554. Julia Domna, wife of Septimius Severus.\r\n\r\n     556. Pertinax.\r\n\r\nThe _Sala a Croce Greca_ contains:\r\n\r\n     _On the right._--The porphyry sarcophagus of Sta. Constantia,\r\n     daughter of Constantine the Great, adorned with sculptures of a\r\n     vintage, brought hither most inappropriately, from her church near\r\n     St'Agnese.\r\n\r\n     _On the left._--The porphyry sarcophagus of Sta. Helena, mother of\r\n     Constantine the Great, carried off from her tomb (now called Torre\r\n     Pignatarra) by Anastasius IV., and placed in the Lateran, whence it\r\n     was brought hither by Pius VI. The restoration of its reliefs,\r\n     representing battle scenes of the time of Constantine, cost\r\n     £20,000.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hall on the right is a recumbent river-god, said to\r\nhave been restored by Michael Angelo. The stairs, adorned with twenty\r\nancient columns from Palestrina, lead to:\r\n\r\nThe _Sala della Biga_, so called from a white marble chariot, drawn by\r\ntwo horses. Only the body of the chariot (which long served as an\r\nepiscopal throne in the church of S. Marco) and part of the horse on\r\nthe right, are ancient; the remainder is restoration. Among the\r\nsculptures here, are:\r\n\r\n     608. Bearded Bacchus.\r\n\r\n     609. An interesting sarcophagus representing a chariot-race. The\r\n     chariots are driven by Amorini, who are not attending to what they\r\n     are about, and drive over one another. The eggs and dolphins on the\r\n     winning-posts indicated the number of times they had gone round;\r\n     each time they passed another egg and dolphin were put up.\r\n\r\n     610. Bacchus, as a woman.\r\n\r\n     611. Alcibiades?\r\n\r\n     612. Veiled priest, from the Giustiniani collection.\r\n\r\n     614. Apollo Citharædus.\r\n\r\n     615. Discobolus, copy of a bronze statue by Naubides.\r\n\r\n     616. *Phocion, very remarkable and beautiful from the extreme\r\n     simplicity of the drapery.\r\n\r\n     618.

Ce n'est pas la main, c'est la personne\r\n     tout entière qui va lancer le disque.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii.\r\n     270.\r\n\r\n     619. Charioteer.\r\n\r\nProceeding in a straight line from the top of the stairs, we enter:\r\n\r\nThe _Galleria dei Candelabri_, 300 feet long, filled with small pieces\r\nof sculpture. Among these we may notice in the centre, on the right,\r\nBacchus and Silenus, found near the Sancta-Sanctorum, also:\r\n\r\n     194. Boy with a goose.\r\n\r\n     224. Nemesis.\r\n\r\n     'Une petite statue da Vatican rappelle une curieuse anecdote dont\r\n     le héros est Agoracrite. Alcamène et lui avaient fait chacun une\r\n     statue de Vénus. Celle d'Alcamène fut jugée la meilleure par les\r\n     Athéniens. Agoracrite, indigné de ce qui lui semblait une\r\n     injustice, transforma la sienne en Némésis, déesse vengeresse de\r\n     l'équité violée, et le rendit aux habitants du bourg de Rhamnus, à\r\n     condition qu'elle ne serait jamais exposée à Athènes. Ceci montre\r\n     combien sa Vénus avait gardé la sévérité du type primitif. Ce n'est\r\n     pas de la Vénus du Capitole ou de la Vénus de Médicis, qu'on aurait\r\n     pu faire une Némésis. Némésis avait pour emblème la coudée, signe\r\n     de la _mesure_ que Némésis ne permet point de dépasser, et\r\n     l'avant-bras était la figure de la _coudée_, par suite, de la\r\n     mesure. C'est pourquoi quand on représentait Némésis on plaçait\r\n     toujours l'avant-bras de manière d'attirer sur lui l'attention.\r\n     Dans la Némésis du Vatican la donnée sévère est devenue un motif\r\n     aimable. Cet avant-bras, qu'il fallait montrer pour rappeller une\r\n     loi terrible, Némésis le montre en effet, mais elle s'en sert avec\r\n     grâce pour rattacher son vêtement.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iii. 260.\r\n\r\n     253. Statuette of Ceres, the head from some other statue.\r\n\r\nHence we enter:\r\n\r\nThe _Galleria degli Arazzi_ (open gratis on Mondays), hung with\r\ntapestries from the New Testament History, executed for the lower walls\r\nof the Sistine Chapel, in 1515--16, for Leo X., from the cartoons of\r\n_Raphael_, of which seven were purchased in Flanders by Charles I., and\r\nare now at Hampton Court. The tapestries are ill arranged. According to\r\ntheir present order, beginning on the left wall, they are:\r\n\r\n     1. St. Peter receiving the keys. (On the border, the flight of\r\n     Cardinal de' Medici from Florence in 1494, disguised as a\r\n     Franciscan Monk.)\r\n\r\n     2. The Miraculous draught of Fishes.\r\n\r\n     3. The Sacrifice at Lystra.\r\n\r\n     4. St. Paul preaching at Athens.\r\n\r\n     5. The Saviour and Mary Magdalene.\r\n\r\n     6. The Supper at Emmaus.\r\n\r\n     7. The Presentation in the Temple.\r\n\r\n     8. The Adoration of the Shepherds.\r\n\r\n     9. The Ascension.\r\n\r\n     10. The Adoration of the Magi.\r\n\r\n     11. The Resurrection.\r\n\r\n     12. The Day of Pentecost.\r\n\r\nReturning, on the right wall, are:\r\n\r\n     1. An Allegorical Composition of the Triumph of Religion (by _Van\r\n     Orley_ and other pupils of Raphael).\r\n\r\n     2. The Stoning of Stephen (on the border the return of the Cardinal\r\n     de' Medici to Florence as Legate).\r\n\r\n     3. Elymas the Sorcerer (?--removed 1869--70).\r\n\r\n     4, 5, 6. Massacre of the Innocents.\r\n\r\n     7. (Smaller than the others.) Christ falling under the Cross.\r\n\r\n     8. Christ appearing to his disciples on the shore of the Lake of\r\n     Galilee.\r\n\r\n     9. Peter and John healing the lame man.\r\n\r\n     10. The Conversion of St. Paul.\r\n\r\nThe Arazzi were long used as church decorations on high festivals.\r\n\r\n     \"On Corpus-Christi Day I learnt the true destination of the\r\n     Tapestries, when they transformed colonnades and open spaces into\r\n     handsome halls and corridors: and while they placed before us the\r\n     power of the most gifted of men, they gave us at the same time the\r\n     happiest example of art and handicraft, each in its highest\r\n     perfection, meeting for mutual completion.\"--_Goethe._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Library of the Vatican_ is shown from 12 to 3, except on Sundays\r\nand festivals, but the visitor is hurried through in a crowd by a\r\ncustode, and there is no time for examination of the individual objects.\r\nThe entrance is by a door on the left at the end of the Galleria\r\nLapidaria, which leads to the museum of statues. The Papal Library was\r\nfounded by the early popes at the Lateran. The Public Library was begun\r\nby Nicholas V., and greatly increased under Sixtus IV. (1475) and Sixtus\r\nV. (1588), who built the present halls for the collection. In 1623 the\r\nlibrary was increased by the gift of the \"Bibliotheca Palatina\" of\r\nHeidelberg, captured by Tilly from Maximilian of Bavaria; in 1657 by the\r\n\"Bibliotheca Urbinas,\" founded by Federigo da Montefeltro; in 1690 by\r\nthe \"Bibliotheca Reginensis,\" or \"Alexandrina,\" which belonged to\r\nChristina of Sweden; in 1746 by the Bibliotheca Ottoboniana, purchased\r\nby the Ottobuoni pope, Alexander VIII. The number of Greek, Latin, and\r\nOriental MSS. in the collection has been reckoned at 23,580.\r\n\r\nThe ante-chambers are hung with portraits of the Librarians;--among\r\nthem, in the first room, is that of Cardinal Mezzofanti. In this room\r\nare facsimiles of the columns found in the Triopium of Herodes Atticus\r\n(see the account of the Valle Caffarelli), of which the originals are at\r\nNaples. From the second ante-chamber we enter the _Great Hall_, 220 feet\r\nlong, decorated with frescoes by _Scipione Gaetani_, _Cesare Nebbia_,\r\nand others,--unimportant in themselves, but producing a rich general\r\neffect of colour. No books or MSS. are visible; they are all enclosed in\r\npainted cupboards, so that of a _library_ there is no appearance\r\nwhatever, and it is only disappointing to be told that in one cupboard\r\nare the MSS. of the Greek Testament of the fifth century, Virgil of the\r\nfifth, and Terence of the fourth centuries, and that another contains a\r\nDante, with miniatures by _Giulio Clovio_,[348] &c. Ranged along the\r\nmiddle of the hall are some of the handsome presents made to Pius IX. by\r\ndifferent foreign potentates, including the Sèvres font, in which the\r\nPrince Imperial was baptized, presented by Napoleon III., and some\r\ncandelabra given by Napoleon I. to Pius VII. At the end of the hall,\r\nlong corridors open out on either side. Turning to the left, the second\r\nroom has two interesting frescoes--one representing St. Peter's as\r\ndesigned by Michael Angelo, the other the erection of the obelisk in the\r\nPiazza S. Pietro under Fontana. At the end of the third room are two\r\nancient statues, said to represent Aristides, and Hippolytus Bishop of\r\nPorto. The fourth room is a museum of Christian antiquities, and\r\ncontains, on the left, a collection of lamps and other small objects\r\nfrom the Catacombs; on the right, some fine ivories by _Guido da\r\nSpoleto_, and a Deposition from the Cross attributed to _Michael\r\nAngelo_. The room beyond this, painted by _Raphael Mengs_, is called the\r\nStanza dei Papiri, and is adorned with papyri of the fifth, sixth, and\r\nseventh centuries. The next room has an interesting collection of\r\npictures, by early masters of the schools of _Giotto_, _Giottino_,\r\n_Cimabue_, and _Fra Angelico_. Here is a Prie Dieu, of carved oak and\r\nivory, presented to Pius IX. by the four bishops of the province of\r\nTours.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this room, not generally shown, is the _Chapel of St. Pius\r\nV._\r\n\r\nThe _Appartamenti Borgia_, which are reached from hence, are only shown\r\nby a special permission, difficult to obtain. They consist of four\r\nrooms, which were built by Alexander VI., though their beautiful\r\ndecorations were chiefly added by Leo X. The _first room_ is painted by\r\n_Giovanni da Udine_ and _Pierino del Vaga_, and represents the course of\r\nthe planets,--Jupiter drawn by eagles, Venus by doves, Diana (the moon)\r\nby nymphs, Mars by wolves, Mercury by cocks, Apollo (the sun) by horses,\r\nSaturn by dragons. These frescoes, executed at the time Michael Angelo\r\nwas painting the Last Judgment, are interesting as the last revival\r\nunder Clement VII. of the pagan art so popular in the papal palace under\r\nLeo X.\r\n\r\nThe second room, painted by _Pinturicchio_, has beautiful lunettes of\r\nthe Annunciation, Adoration of the Magi, Resurrection, Ascension,\r\nDescent of the Holy Ghost, and Assumption of the Virgin. The ceiling of\r\nthe _third room_ has paintings by _Pinturicchio_ of the Martyrdom of St\r\nSebastian; the Visitation of St Elizabeth; the Meeting of St Anthony\r\nwith St. Paul, the first hermit; St. Catherine before Maximian; the\r\nFlight of St. Barbara; St. Julian of Nicomedia; and, over the door, the\r\nVirgin and Child. This last picture is of curious historical interest,\r\nas a relic of the libertinism of the court of Alexander VI. (Rodrigo\r\nBorgia), the \"figure of the Virgin being a faithful representation of\r\nGiulia Farnese, the too celebrated Vanozza,\" mistress of the pope, and\r\nmother of his children, Cæsar and Lucrezia. \"She held upon her knees the\r\ninfant Jesus, and Alexander knelt at her feet.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth room, also painted by _Pinturicchio_, is adorned with\r\nallegorical figures of the Arts and Sciences, and of the Cardinal\r\nVirtues.\r\n\r\n     \"On the accession of the infamous Alexander VI., Pinturicchio was\r\n     employed by him to paint the Appartamento Borgia, and a great\r\n     number of rooms, both in the castle of S. Angelo and in the\r\n     pontifical palace. The patronage of this pope was still more fatal\r\n     to the arts than that of the Medici at Florence. The subjects\r\n     represented in the castle of S. Angelo were drawn from the life of\r\n     Alexander himself, and the portraits of his relations and friends\r\n     were introduced there,--amongst others, those of his brothers,\r\n     sisters, and that of the infamous Cæsar Borgia. To all acquainted\r\n     with the scandalous history of this family, this representation\r\n     appeared a commemoration of their various crimes, and it was\r\n     impossible to regard it in any other light, when, in addition to\r\n     the publicity they affected to give to these scandalous excesses,\r\n     they appeared desirous of making art itself their accomplice; and\r\n     by an excess of profanation hitherto unexampled in the Catholic\r\n     world, Alexander VI. caused himself to be represented, in a room in\r\n     the Vatican, in the costume of one of the Magi, kneeling before the\r\n     holy Virgin, whose head was no other than the portrait of the\r\n     beautiful Giulia Farnese ('Vanozza'), whose adventures are\r\n     unfortunately too well known. We may indeed say that the walls have\r\n     in this case made up for the silence of the courtiers: for on them\r\n     was traced, for the benefit of contemporaries and posterity, an\r\n     undeniable proof of the depravity of the age.\r\n\r\n     \"At the sight of that Appartamento Borgia, which is entirely\r\n     painted by Pinturicchio, we shall experience a sort of satisfaction\r\n     in discovering the inferiority of this purely mercenary work, as\r\n     compared with the other productions of the same artist, and we\r\n     cannot but rejoice that it is so unworthy of him. Such an ignoble\r\n     task was not adapted to an artist of the Umbrian school, and there\r\n     is good reason to believe that, after this act of servility,\r\n     Pinturicchio became disgusted with Rome, and returned to the\r\n     mountains of Umbria, in search of nobler inspirations.\"--_Rio.\r\n     Poetry of Christian Art._\r\n\r\nA door on the right of the room with the old pictures opens into a room\r\ncontaining a very interesting collection of ancient frescoes. On the\r\nright wall is the celebrated \"_Nozze Aldobrandini_,\" found in 1606[349]\r\nin some ruins belonging to the baths of Titus near the arch of Gallienus\r\non the Esquiline, and considered to be the finest specimen of ancient\r\npictorial art in Rome. It was purchased at first by the Aldobrandini\r\nfamily, whence its name. It represents an ancient Greek ceremony,\r\npossibly the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis. There is a fine copy by\r\nNicholas Poussin in the Doria Palace.\r\n\r\n     \"S'il fait allusion à un sujet mythologique, le réel y est à côté\r\n     de l'idéal, et la mythologie y est appliquée à la représentation\r\n     d'un mariage ordinaire. Tout porte à y voir une peinture romaine,\r\n     mais l'auteur s'était inspiré des Grecs, comme on s'en inspirait\r\n     presque toujours à Rome. La nouvelle mariée, assise sur le lit\r\n     nuptial et attendant son époux, a cette expression de pudeur\r\n     virginale, d'embarras modeste, qui avait rendu célèbre un tableau\r\n     dont le sujet était le mariage de Roxane et l'auteur Ætion, peintre\r\n     grec.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ iv. 127.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this is a Race of the Cupids, from Ostia. The other frescoes\r\nin this room were found in the ruins on the Esquiline and at the Torre\r\ndi Marancia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Etruscan Museum_ can be visited on application to the custode,\r\nevery day except Monday, from 10 to 2. It is reached by the staircase\r\nwhich passes the entrance to the Gallery of Candelabra: after which one\r\nmust ring at a closed door on the right.\r\n\r\n     \"This magnificent collection is principally the fruit of the\r\n     excavating partnership established, some twelve or fifteen years\r\n     since, between the Papal government and the Campanari of\r\n     Toscanella; and will render the memory of Gregory XVI., who\r\n     forwarded its formation with more zeal than he ordinarily\r\n     displayed, ever honoured by all interested in antiquarian science.\r\n     As the excavations were made in the neighbourhood of Vulci, most of\r\n     the articles are from that necropolis; yet the collection has been\r\n     considerably enlarged by the addition of others previously in the\r\n     possession of the government, and still more by recent acquisitions\r\n     from the Etruscan cemeteries of Cervetri, Corneto, Bomarzo, Orte,\r\n     Toscanella, and other sites within the Papal dominions.\"--_Dennis._\r\n\r\n_The 1st Room_--\r\n\r\n     Contains three sarcophagi of terra-cotta from Toscanella, with\r\n     three life-size figures reposing upon them. Their extreme length is\r\n     remarkable. The figure on the left wears a fillet, indicating\r\n     priesthood. The head of the family was almost always priest or\r\n     priestess. Most of the objects in terra-cotta, which have been\r\n     discovered, come from Toscanella. The two horses' heads in this\r\n     room, in nenfro, i.e. volcanic tufa, were found at the entrance of\r\n     a tomb at Vulci.\r\n\r\n_The 2nd Room_--\r\n\r\n     Is a corridor filled with cinerary urns, chiefly from Volterra,\r\n     bearing recumbent figures, ludicrously stunted. The large\r\n     sarcophagus on the left supports the bearded figure of a man, and\r\n     is adorned with reliefs of a figure in a chariot and musicians\r\n     painted red. The urns in this room are of alabaster, which is the\r\n     characteristic of Volterra.\r\n\r\n_The 3rd Room_--\r\n\r\n     Has in the centre a large sarcophagus of nenfro, found at\r\n     Tarquinii, in 1834, supporting a reclining figure of a Lucumo, with\r\n     a scroll in his hand, \"recalling the monuments of the middle ages.\"\r\n     At the sides are reliefs representing the story of Clytemnestra and\r\n     Ægisthus,--the Theban brothers,--the sacrifice of\r\n     Clytemnestra,--and Pyrrhus slaying the infant Astyanax. In this\r\n     room is a slab with a bilingual inscription, in Latin and Umbrian,\r\n     from Todi. In the comers are some curious cinerary urns shaped like\r\n     houses.\r\n\r\n_The 4th Room_--\r\n\r\n     Is the Chamber of Terra-cottas. In the centre is a most beautiful\r\n     statue of Mercury found at Tivoli. At the sides are fragments of\r\n     female figures from Vulci,--and an interesting terra-cotta urn from\r\n     Toscanella, with a youth lying on a couch. \"From the gash in his\r\n     thigh, and the hound at his bed-side, he is usually called Adonis;\r\n     but it may be merely the effigy of some young Etruscan, who met his\r\n     death in the wild-boar chase.\"\r\n\r\n_The 5th Room_--\r\n\r\n     This and the three following rooms are occupied by Vases. The vases\r\n     in the 5th room are mostly small amphoræ, in the second or Archaic\r\n     style, with black figures on the ground of the clay. On a column,\r\n     near the window, is a _Crater_, or mixing-vase, from Vulci, with\r\n     parti-coloured figures on a very pale ground, and in the most\r\n     beautiful style of Greek art. It represents Mercury presenting the\r\n     infant Bacchus to Silenus. To the left of the window is a humorous\r\n     representation of the visit of Jupiter and Mercury to Alcmena, who\r\n     is looking at them out of a window. In the cabinets are objects in\r\n     crystal from Palestrina.\r\n\r\n_The 6th Room_--\r\n\r\n     In the centre of this room are five magnificent vases. The central,\r\n     from Cervetri, \"is of the rare form called _Holmos_--a large\r\n     globe-shaped bowl on a tall stand, like an enormous cup and ball;\"\r\n     its paintings are of wild animals. Nearest the entrance is, with\r\n     three handles, \"a _Calpis_, of the third or perfect style,\" from\r\n     Vulci, with paintings of Apollo and six Muses. Behind this, from\r\n     Vulci, is \"a large _Amphora_ of the second or Archaic style,\" in\r\n     which hardness and severity of design are combined with most\r\n     conscientious execution of detail. It represents Achilles\r\n     (\"Achilleos\") and Ajax (\"Aiantos\") playing at dice, or _astralagi_.\r\n     Achilles cries \"Four!\" and Ajax \"Three!\"--the said words, in choice\r\n     Attic, issuing from their mouths. The maker's name, \"Echsekias,\" is\r\n     recorded, as well as that of \"the brave Onetorides\" to whom it was\r\n     presented. On the other side of the vase is a family scene of\r\n     \"Kastor\" with his horse, and \"Poludeukes\" playing with his dog,\r\n     \"Tyndareos\" and \"Leda\" standing by. 4th, is an _Amphora_ from Cære,\r\n     representing the body of Achilles borne to Peleus and Thetis. 5th,\r\n     is a _Calpis_ from Vulci, representing the death of Hector in the\r\n     arms of Minerva.\r\n\r\n     The 6th vase on the shelf of the entrance wall is the kind of\r\n     amphora called a _Pelice_, from Cære. \"Two men are represented\r\n     sitting under an olive-tree, each with an amphora at his feet,\" and\r\n     one who is measuring the oil exclaims, \"O father Jupiter, would\r\n     that I were rich!\" On the reverse of the vase is the same pair, at\r\n     a subsequent period, when the prayer has been heard, and the\r\n     oil-dealer cries, \"Verily, yea, verily, it hath been filled to\r\n     overflowing.\" By the window is a _Calpis_, representing a boy with\r\n     a hoop in one hand, and a stolen cock in the other, for which his\r\n     tutor is reproving him.\r\n\r\n_The 7th Room_--\r\n\r\n     Is an arched corridor. In the second niche, is a _Hydria_ with\r\n     Minerva and Hercules, from Vulci. Sixth on the line, is an\r\n     _Amphora_ from Vulci; \"'Ekabe' (Hecuba) presents a goblet to her\r\n     son, 'the brave Hector,'--and regards him with such intense\r\n     interest, that she spills the wine as she pours it out to him.\r\n     'Priamos' stands by, leaning on his staff, looking mournfully at\r\n     his son, as if presaging his fate.\" Many other vases in this room\r\n     are of great beauty.\r\n\r\n_The 8th Room_--\r\n\r\n     \"Contains _Cylices_ or _Pateræ_, which are more rare than the\r\n     upright vases, and not inferior in beauty.\"\r\n\r\n_The 9th Room_--\r\n\r\n     Entered from the 6th room, is the jewel room. Among the bronzes on\r\n     the right, is a warrior in armour found at Todi in 1835 and a\r\n     bronze couch with a raised place for the head, found in the\r\n     Regulini Galassi tomb at Cervetri, where it bore the corpse of a\r\n     high priest. A boy with a bulla, sitting, from Tarquinii, is\r\n     \"supposed to represent Tages, the mysterious boy-god, who sprung\r\n     from the furrows of that site.\"\r\n\r\n     At the opposite end of the room is a biga or war-chariot, not\r\n     Etruscan, but Roman, found in the villa of the Quintilii, near the\r\n     Via Appia. Near this are some colossal fragments of bronze\r\n     statues, found near Civita Vecchia. A beautiful oval _Cista_, with\r\n     a handle formed by two swans bearing a boy and a girl, is from\r\n     Vulci; and so are the braziers or censers retaining the tongs,\r\n     shovel, and rake, found with them:--\"the tongs are on wheels, and\r\n     terminate in serpents' heads; the shovel handle ends in a swan's\r\n     neck; and the rake in a human hand.\" Among the smaller relics are a\r\n     curious bottle from Cære, with an Etruscan alphabet and spelling\r\n     lesson (!) scratched upon it, and a pair of Etruscan clogs found in\r\n     a tomb at Vulci.\r\n\r\n     In the centre of the room is the jewel-case of glass. The whole of\r\n     the upper division and one compartment of the lower are devoted to\r\n     Cervetri (Cære). All these objects are from the Regulini Galassi\r\n     tomb, for all the other tombs had been rifled at an early period,\r\n     except one, whence the objects were taken by Campana. The\r\n     magnificent oak-wreath with the small ornaments and the large\r\n     ear-rings were worn by a lady, over whom was written in Etruscan\r\n     characters, \"Me Larthia,\"--I, the Great Lady,--evidently because at\r\n     the time of her death, 3000 years ago, it was supposed that she was\r\n     so very great that the memory of her name could never by any\r\n     possibility perish, and that therefore it was quite unnecessary to\r\n     record it. The tomb was divided, and she was walled up with\r\n     precious spices (showing what the commerce of Etruria must have\r\n     been) in one half of it. It was several hundred years before any\r\n     one was found of sufficient dignity to occupy the other half of the\r\n     great lady's tomb. Then the high priest of Etruria died, and was\r\n     buried there with all his ornaments. His were the large bracelets,\r\n     the fillets for the head, with the plate of gold covering the head,\r\n     and a second plate of gold which covered the forehead--worn only on\r\n     the most solemn occasions. This may be considered to have been the\r\n     headdress of Aaron. His also was the broad plate of gold, covering\r\n     the breast, reminding of the Urim and Thummim. The bronze bed on\r\n     which he lay (and on which the ornaments were found lying where the\r\n     body had mouldered) is preserved in another part of the room, and\r\n     the great incense burner filled with precious spices which was\r\n     found by his side. The three large bollas on his breast were filled\r\n     with incense, whose perfume was still so strong when the tomb was\r\n     opened, that those who burnt it could not remain in the room.\r\n\r\n     The ivy leaves on the ornaments denote the worship of Bacchus, a\r\n     late period in Etruria: laurel denotes a victor in battle or the\r\n     games.\r\n\r\n_The 10th Room_--\r\n\r\n     (Entrance on right of the jewel-room), is a passage containing a\r\n     number of Roman water-pipes of lead, and the bronze figure of a boy\r\n     with a bird and an Etruscan inscription on his leg, from Perugia.\r\n\r\n_The 11th Room_--\r\n\r\n     Is hung with paintings on canvas copied from the principal tombs of\r\n     Vulci and Tarquinii. Beginning from the right, on entering, they\r\n     take the following order:\r\n\r\n    From the Camera del Morto: Tarquinii.\r\n    From the Grotta delle Bighe, or Grotta Stackelberg: Tarquinii.\r\n    From the Grotta Querciola: Tarquinii\r\n    From the Grotta della Iscrizioni: Tarquinii.\r\n    From the Grotta del Triclinio, or Grotta Marzi: Tarquinii.\r\n    From the Grotta del Barone, or Grotta del Ministro: Tarquinii.\r\n    From the painted tomb at Vulci.\r\n\r\n     \"All the paintings from Tarquinii are still to be seen on that\r\n     site, though not in so perfect a state as they are here\r\n     represented. But the tomb at Vulci is utterly destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n     Each of the paintings is most interesting. That of the death-bed\r\n     scene proves that the Etruscans believed in the immortality of the\r\n     soul. In the upper division a daughter is mounting on a stool to\r\n     reach the high bed and give a last kiss to her dying father, while\r\n     the son is wailing and lamenting in the background. Below, is the\r\n     rejoicing spirit, freed from the trammels of the flesh.\r\n\r\n     In the scenes representing the games, the horses are painted bright\r\n     red and bright blue, or black and red. These may be considered to\r\n     have been the different colours of the rival parties. A number of\r\n     jars for oil and wine are arranged in this room. All the black\r\n     pottery is from Northern Etruria.\r\n\r\n_The 12th Room_ (entered from the left of the jewel room) is a very\r\nmeagre and most inefficient facsimile of an ordinary Etruscan tomb. It\r\nis guarded by two lions in nenfro, found at Vulci.[350]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Egyptian Museum_ is entered by a door on the left of the entrance\r\nof the Museo Pio-Clementino. It is open gratis on Mondays from 12 to 3.\r\nThe collection is chiefly due to Pius VII. and Gregory XVI. The greater\r\npart is of no especial importance.\r\n\r\n_The 6th Room_ contains eight statues of the goddess Pasht from Carnac.\r\n\r\n_The 8th Room_ is occupied by Roman imitations of Egyptian statues, from\r\nthe Villa Adriana.\r\n\r\n     \"Ces statues sont toutes des traductions de l'art égyptien en art\r\n     grec. L'alliance, la fusion de la sculpture égyptienne et de la\r\n     sculpture gréco-romaine est un des traits les plus saillantes de\r\n     cosmopolitisme si étranger à d'anciennes traditions nationales, et\r\n     dont Adrien, par ses voyages, ses goûts, ces monuments, fut la plus\r\n     éclatante manifestation.\r\n\r\n     \"Sauf l'Antinoüs, les produits de cette sculpture d'imitation bien\r\n     que datant d'une époque encore brillante de l'art romain, ne\r\n     sauraient le disputer à leurs modèles. Pour s'en convaincre, il\r\n     suffit de les comparer aux statues vraiment égyptiennes qui\r\n     remplissent une salle voisine. Dans celles-ci, la réalité du détail\r\n     est méprisée et sacrifiée; mais les traits fondamentaux, les\r\n     linéaments essentiels de la forme sont rendus admirablement. De là\r\n     un grand style, car employer l'expression la plus générale, c'est\r\n     le secret de la grandeur du style, comme a dit Buffon. Cette\r\n     élévation, cette sobriété du génie égyptien ne se retrouvent plus\r\n     dans les imitations bâtardes du temps d'Adrien.\"--_Ampère, Emp._\r\n     ii. 197, 202.\r\n\r\nOn the right is the Nile in black marble; opposite the entrance is a\r\ncolossal statue of Antinous, the favourite of Hadrian, in white marble.\r\n\r\n     \"Il est naturel qu'Antinoüs, qui s'était, disait-on, précipité dans\r\n     le Nil, ait été représenté sous les traits d'un dieu égyptien ...\r\n     La physiognomie triste d'Antinoüs sied bien à un dieu d'Egypte, et\r\n     le style grec emprunte au reflet du style égyptien une grandeur\r\n     sombre.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii 196.\r\n\r\n_The 9th Room_ contains colossal Egyptian statues. On the right is the\r\nfigure of the mother of Rhamses II. (Sesostris) between two lions of\r\nbasalt, which were found in the Baths of Agrippa, and which long\r\ndecorated the Fontana dei Termini. Upon the base of these lions is\r\ninscribed the name of the Egyptian king Nectanebo.\r\n\r\n     \"Dans cette sculpture bien égyptienne, on sent déjà le souffle de\r\n     l'art grec. La pose de ces lions est la pose roide et monumentale\r\n     des lions à tête humaine de Louqsor; la crinière est encore de\r\n     convention, mais la vie est exprimée, les muscles sont accusés avec\r\n     un soin et un relief que la sculpture purement égyptienne n'a pas\r\n     connus.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 198.\r\n\r\n     \"Ces lions ont une expression remarquable de force et de repos; il\r\n     y a quelque chose dans leur physiognomie qui n'appartient ni à\r\n     l'animal ni à l'homme: ils semblent une puissance de la nature, et\r\n     l'on conçoit, en les voyant, comment les dieux du paganisme\r\n     pouvaient être représentés sous cet emblème.\"--_Mad. de Staël._\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the entrance-wall are, Ptolemy-Philadelphus, and, on\r\nhis left, his queen Arsinoë, of red granite. These were found in the\r\ngardens of Sallust, and were formerly preserved in the Senator's Palace.\r\n\r\n     \"There is a fine collection of Egyptian antiquities in the Vatican;\r\n     and the ceilings of the rooms in which they are arranged, are\r\n     painted to represent a starlight sky in the desert. It may seem an\r\n     odd idea, but it is very effective. The grim, half-human monsters\r\n     from the temples, look more grim and monstrous underneath the deep\r\n     dark blue; it sheds a strange uncertain gloomy air on everything--a\r\n     mystery adapted to the objects; and you leave them, as you find\r\n     them, shrouded in a solemn night.\"--_Dickens._\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Gallery has an egress into the Sala a Croce Greca.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe windows of the Egyptian Museum look upon the inner _Garden of the\r\nVatican_, which may be reached by a door at the end of the long gallery\r\nof the Museo Chiaramonti, before ascending to the Torso. The garden\r\nwhich is thus entered, called _Giardino della Pigna_, is in fact merely\r\nthe second great quadrangle of the Vatican, planted with shrubs and\r\nflowers. Several interesting relics are preserved here. In the centre\r\nis the _Pedestal of the Column of Antoninus Pius_, found in 1709 on the\r\nMonte Citorio. The column was a simple memorial pillar of granite,\r\nerected by the two adopted sons of the emperor, Marcus Aurelius and\r\nLucius Verus. It was broken up to mend the obelisk of Psammeticus I. at\r\nthe Monte Citorio. Among the reliefs of the pedestal is one of a winged\r\ngenius guiding Antoninus and Faustina to Olympus. In the great\r\nsemicircular niche of Bramante, at the end of the court-garden, is the\r\nfamous _Pigna_, a gigantic fir-cone, which once crowned the summit of\r\nthe Mausoleum of Hadrian. Thence it was first removed to the front of\r\nthe old basilica of St. Peter's. In the fresco of the old St. Peter's at\r\nS. Martino al Monte, the pigna is introduced, but it is there placed in\r\nthe centre of the nave, a position it never occupied. Dante saw it at\r\nSt. Peter's, and compares it to a giant's head (it is eleven feet high)\r\nwhich he saw through the mist in the last circle of hell.\r\n\r\n    \"La faccia mi parea lunga e grossa\r\n    Come la pina di S. Pietro in Roma.\"\r\n\r\nOn either side of the pigna are two bronze peacocks, which are said to\r\nhave stood on either side the entrance of Hadrian's Mausoleum.\r\n\r\n     \"Je pense qu'ils y avaient été placés en l'honneur des impératrices\r\n     dont les cendres devaient s'y trouver. La paon consacré à Junon\r\n     était le symbole de l'apothéose des impératrices, comme l'oiseau\r\n     dédié à Jupiter celui de l'apothéose des empereurs, car le mausolée\r\n     d'Adrien n'était pas pour lui seul, mais, comme avaient été le\r\n     mausolée d'Auguste et le temple des Flaviens, pour toute la famille\r\n     impériale.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 212.\r\n\r\nA flight of steps leads from this court to the narrow _Terrace of the\r\nNavicella_, in front of the palace, so called from a bronze ship with\r\nwhich its fountain is decorated. The visitor should beware of the\r\ntricksome water-works upon this terrace.\r\n\r\nBeyond the courtyard is the entrance to the larger garden, which may be\r\nreached in a carriage by those who do not wish to visit the palace on\r\nthe way, by driving round through the courts at the back of St. Peter's.\r\nFormerly it was always open till 2 P.M., after which hour the pope went\r\nthere to walk, or to ride upon his white mule. It is a most delightful\r\nretreat for the hot days of May and June, and before that time its woods\r\nare carpeted with wild violets and anemones. No one who has not visited\r\nthem can form any idea of the beauty of these ancient groves,\r\ninterspersed with fountains and statues, but otherwise left to nature,\r\nand forming a fragment of sylvan scenery quite unassociated with the\r\nEnglish idea of a garden. They are backed by the walls of the Borgo, and\r\na fine old tower of the time of Leo IV. The _Casino del Papa_, or Villa\r\nPia,[351] built by Pius IV. in the lower and more cultivated portion of\r\nthe ground, is the chef-d'œuvre of the architect, Pirro Ligorio, and\r\nis decorated with paintings by _Baroccio_, _Zucchero_, and _Santi di\r\nTito_, and a set of terra-cotta reliefs collected by Agincourt and\r\nCanova. The shell decorations are pretty and curious.\r\n\r\nDuring the hours which he spent daily in this villa, its founder Pius\r\nIV. enjoyed that easy and simple life for which he was far better fitted\r\nby nature than for the affairs of government; but here also he received\r\nthe counsels of his nephew S. Carlo Borromeo, who, summoned to Rome in\r\n1560, became for several succeeding years the real ruler of the state.\r\nHere he assembled around him all those who were distinguished by their\r\nvirtue or talents, and held many of the meetings which received the\r\nname of _Notte Vaticane_--at first employed in the pursuit of philosophy\r\nand poetry, but--after the necessity of Church reform became apparent\r\nboth to the pope and to S. Carlo--entirely devoted to the discussion of\r\nsacred subjects. In this villa the late popes, Pius VIII. and Gregory\r\nXVI., used frequently to give their audiences.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century was the golden age for the Vatican. Then the\r\nsplendid court of Leo X. was the centre of artistic and literary life,\r\nand the witty and pleasure-loving pope made these gardens the scene of\r\nhis banquets and concerts; and, in a circle to which ladies were\r\nadmitted, as in a secular court, listened to the recitations of the\r\npoets who sprang up under his protection, beneath the shadow of its\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n     \"Le Vatican était encombré, sous Leon X., d'historiens, de savants,\r\n     de poëtes surtout. 'La tourbe importune des poëtes,' s'écrie\r\n     Valérianus, 'le poursuit de porte en porte, tantôt sous les\r\n     portiques, tantôt à la promenade, tantôt au palais, tantôt à la\r\n     chambre, _penetralibus in imis_; elle ne respecte ni son repos, ni\r\n     les graves affaires qui l'occupent aujourd'hui que l'incendie\r\n     ravage le monde.' On remarquait dans cette foule: Berni, le poëte\r\n     burlesque; Flaminio, le poëte élégiaque; Molza, l'enfant de\r\n     Pétrarque, et Postumo, Maroni, Carteromachus, Fedra Inghirami, le\r\n     savant bibliothécaire, et _la grande lumière d'Arezzo_, comme dit\r\n     l'Arioste, _l'unique Accolti_. Accolti jouit pendant toute la durée\r\n     du seizième siècle d'une réputation que la postérité n'a pas\r\n     confirmée. On l'appelait le _céleste_. Lorsqu'il devait réciter ses\r\n     vers, les magasins étaient fermés comme en un jour de fête, et\r\n     chacun accourait pour l'entendre. Il était entouré de prélats de la\r\n     première distinction; un corps de troupes suisses l'accompagnait,\r\n     et l'auditoire était éclairé par des flambeaux. Un jour qu'Accolti\r\n     entrait chez le pape:--Ouvrez toutes les portes, s'écria Léon, et\r\n     laissez entrer la foule. Accolti récita un _ternale_ à la Vierge,\r\n     et, quand il eut fini, mille acclamations retentirent: _Vive le\r\n     poëte divin, vive l'incomparable Accolti!_ Léon était le premier à\r\n     applaudir, et le duché de Nessi devenait la récompense du poëte.\r\n\r\n     \"Une autre fois, c'était Paul Jove, l'homme aux _ouï-dires_, comme\r\n     l'appelle Rabelais, qui venait lire des fragments de son histoire,\r\n     et que Léon X. saluait du titre de Tite-Live italien. Il y avait\r\n     dans ces éloges, dans ces encouragements donnés avec entraînement,\r\n     mais avec tact, je ne sais quel souffle de vie pour l'intelligence,\r\n     qui l'activait et qui lui faisait rendre au centuple les dons\r\n     qu'elle avait reçus du ciel. Rome entière était devenue un musée,\r\n     une académie; partout des chants, partout la science, la poésie,\r\n     les beaux-arts, une sorte de volupté dans l'étude. Ici, c'est\r\n     Calcagnini, qui a déjà déviné la rotation de la terre; là, Ambrogio\r\n     de Pise, qui parle chaldéen et arabe; plus loin, Valérianus, que la\r\n     philologie, l'archéologie, la jurisprudence revendiquent à la fois,\r\n     et qui se distrait de ses doctes travaux par des poésies dignes\r\n     d'Horace.\"--_Gournerie, Rome Chrétienne_, ii. 114.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Loggie of Raphael_ are reached, except on Mondays, by the staircase\r\non the left of the fountain in the Cortile S. Damaso. Two sides of the\r\ncorridors on the second floor (formerly open) are decorated in stucco by\r\n_Marco da Faenza_ and _Paul Schnorr_ and painted by _Sicciolante da\r\nSermoneta_, _Tempesta_, _Sabbatini_, and others. The third corridor,\r\nentered on the right (opened by a custode), contains the celebrated\r\nfrescoes, executed by Raphael, or from the designs of Raphael, by Giulio\r\nRomano, Pierino del Vaga, Pellegrino da Modena, Francesco Penni, and\r\nRafaello da Colle. Of the fifty-two subjects represented, forty-eight\r\nare from the Old Testament, only the four last being from the Gospel\r\nHistory, as an appropriate introduction to the pictures which celebrate\r\nthe foundation and triumphs of the Church, in the adjoining stanze. The\r\nstucco decorations of the gallery are of exquisite beauty; especially\r\nremarkable, perhaps, are those of the windows in the first arcade, where\r\nRaphael is represented drawing,--his pupils working from his\r\ndesigns,--and Fame celebrating his work.

The eye\r\n     was so educated and so enlarged by those grand forms and the\r\n     glorious completeness of all their parts, that it could take no\r\n     pleasure in the imaginative play of arabesques, and the scenes from\r\n     Scripture, beautiful as they are, had lost their charm. To see\r\n     these works _often_ alternately and to compare them at leisure and\r\n     without prejudice, must be a great pleasure, but all sympathy is at\r\n     first one-sided.\"--_Goethe, Romische Briefe._\r\n\r\nClose to the entrance of the Loggie is that of\r\n\r\n_The Stanze_, three rooms decorated under Julius II. and Leo X. with\r\nfrescoes by Raphael, for each of which he received 1200 ducats. These\r\nrooms are approached through,--\r\n\r\nThe _Sala di Constantino_, decorated under Clement VII. (Giulio di\r\nMedici) in 1523--34, after the death of Raphael, who however had\r\nprepared drawings for the frescoes, and had already executed in oil the\r\ntwo figures of Justice and Urbanity.

This was the\r\n     last fresco executed by Raphael under Julius II.\r\n\r\n     _Right Wall._--Peter delivered from prison. A fresco by Pietro\r\n     della Francesca was destroyed to make room for this picture, which\r\n     is said to have allusion to the liberation of Leo X., while Legate\r\n     in Spain, after his capture at the battle of Ravenna. This fresco\r\n     is considered especially remarkable for its four lights, those from\r\n     the double representation of the angel, from the torch of the\r\n     soldier, and from the moon.\r\n\r\n     _Wall of Egress._--The Flight of Attila. Leo I. (with the features\r\n     of Leo X.) is represented on his white mule, with his cardinals,\r\n     calling upon SS. Peter and Paul, who appear in the clouds, for aid\r\n     against Attila. The Coliseum is seen in the background.\r\n\r\nThe _Stanza della Segnatura_ is so called from a judicial assembly once\r\nheld here. The frescoes in this chamber are illustrative of the Virtues\r\nof Theology, Philosophy, Poetry, and Jurisprudence, who are represented\r\non the ceiling by _Raphael_, in the midst of arabesques by _Sodoma_. The\r\nsquare pictures by Raphael refer:--the Fall of Man to Theology; the\r\nStudy of the Globe to Philosophy; the Flaying of Marsyas to Poetry; and\r\nthe Judgment of Solomon to Jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n     _Entrance Wall._--\"The School of Athens.\" Raphael consulted Ariosto\r\n     as to the arrangement of its 52 figures. In the centre, on the\r\n     steps of a portico, are seen Plato and Aristotle, Plato pointing to\r\n     heaven, and Aristotle to earth. On the left is Socrates conversing\r\n     with his pupils, amongst whom is a young warrior, probably\r\n     Alcibiades. Lying upon the steps in front is Diogenes. To his left\r\n     Pythagoras is writing on his knee, and near him, with ink and pen,\r\n     is Empedocles. The youth in the white mantle is Francesco Maria\r\n     della Rovere, nephew of Julius II. On the right, is Archimedes,\r\n     drawing a geometrical problem upon the floor. The young man near\r\n     him with uplifted hands is Federigo II., Duke of Mantua. Behind\r\n     these are Zoroaster and Ptolemy, one with a terrestrial, the other\r\n     with a celestial globe, addressing two figures which represent\r\n     Raphael and his master Perugino. The drawing in brown upon the\r\n     socle beneath this fresco, is by _Pierino del Vaga_, and represents\r\n     the death of Archimedes.\r\n\r\n     _Right Wall._--\"Parnassus,\" Apollo surrounded by the Muses, on his\r\n     right Homer, Virgil, and Dante.

Beneath this, in grisaille, are,--Alexander placing the\r\n     poems of Homer in the tomb of Achilles,--and Augustus preventing\r\n     the burning of Virgil's Eneid.\r\n\r\n     _Left Wall._--Above the window are Prudence, Fortitude, and\r\n     Temperance. On the left, Justinian delivers the Pandects to\r\n     Tribonian. On the right, Gregory IX. (with the features of Julius\r\n     II.) delivers the Decretals to a jurist;--Cardinal de' Medici,\r\n     afterwards Leo X., Cardinal Farnese, afterwards Paul III., and\r\n     Cardinal del Monte, are represented near the pope. In the socle\r\n     beneath is Solon addressing the people of Athens.\r\n\r\n     _Wall of Egress_.--\"The Disputa,\" so called from an impression that\r\n     it represents a Dispute upon the Sacrament. In the upper part of\r\n     the composition the heavenly host are present;--Christ between the\r\n     Virgin and St. John Baptist;--On the left, St. Peter, Adam, St.\r\n     John, David, St. Stephen, and another;--On the right, St. Paul,\r\n     Abraham, St. James, Moses, St. Laurence, and St. George. Below is\r\n     an altar surrounded by the Latin fathers, Gregory, Jerome, Ambrose,\r\n     and Augustine. Near St. Augustine stand St. Thomas Aquinas, St.\r\n     Anacletus with the palm of a martyr, and Cardinal Buonaventura\r\n     reading. Those in front are Innocent III., and in the background\r\n     Dante, near whom a monk in a black hood is pointed out as\r\n     Savonarola. The Dominican on the extreme left is supposed to be Fra\r\n     Angelico. The other figures are uncertain.\r\n\r\n     \"Raphaël a bien jugé Dante en plaçant parmi les Théologiens, dans\r\n     la _Dispute du Saint Sacrement_, celui pour la tombe duquel a été\r\n     écrit ce vers, aussi vrai qu'il est plat:\r\n\r\n    'Theologus Dantes, nullius dogmatis expers.'\"\r\n\r\n    _Ampère, Voyage Dantesque._\r\n\r\n     The chiaro-scuros on the socle beneath this fresco are by _Pierino\r\n     del Vaga_ (added under Paul III.) and represent, 1, A heathen\r\n     sacrifice; 2, St. Augustine finding a child attempting to drain the\r\n     sea; 3, The Cumæ Sibyl and Augustus.\r\n\r\n     \"Raphael commenced his work in the Vatican by painting the ceiling\r\n     and the four walls of the room called _della Segnatura_, on the\r\n     surface of which he had to represent four great compositions, which\r\n     embraced the principal divisions of the encyclopædia of that\r\n     period; namely, Theology, Philosophy, Poetry, and Jurisprudence.\r\n\r\n     \"It will be conceived, that to an artist imbued with the traditions\r\n     of the Umbrian school, the first of these subjects was an\r\n     unparalleled piece of good fortune; and Raphael, long familiar with\r\n     the allegorical treatment of religious compositions, turned it here\r\n     to the most admirable account; and, not content with the\r\n     suggestions of his own genius, he availed himself of all the\r\n     instruction he could derive from the intelligence of others. From\r\n     these combined inspirations resulted, to the eternal glory of the\r\n     Catholic faith and of Christian art, a composition without a rival\r\n     in the history of painting, and we may also add without a name; for\r\n     to call it lyric or epic is not enough, unless, indeed, we mean, by\r\n     using these expressions, to compare it with the allegorical epic\r\n     of Dante, alone worthy to be ranked with this marvellous\r\n     production of the pencil of Raphael.\r\n\r\n     \"And let no one consider this praise as idle and groundless, for it\r\n     is Raphael himself who forces the comparison upon us, by placing\r\n     the figure of Dante among the favourite sons of the Muses; and,\r\n     what is still more striking, by draping the allegorical figure of\r\n     Theology in the very colours in which Dante has represented\r\n     Beatrice; namely, the white veil, the red tunic, and the green\r\n     mantle, while on her head he has placed the olive crown.\r\n\r\n     \"Of the four allegorical figures which occupy the compartments of\r\n     the ceiling, and which were all painted immediately after Raphael's\r\n     arrival in Rome, Theology and Poetry are incontestably the most\r\n     remarkable. The latter would be easily distinguished by the calm\r\n     inspiration of her glance, even were she without her wings, her\r\n     starry crown, and her azure robe, all having allusion to the\r\n     elevated region towards which it is her privilege to soar. The\r\n     figure of Theology is quite as admirably suited to the subject she\r\n     personifies; she points to the upper part of the grand composition,\r\n     which takes its name from her, and in which the artist has provided\r\n     inexhaustible food for the sagacity and enthusiasm of the\r\n     spectator.\r\n\r\n     \"This work consists of two grand divisions,--Heaven and\r\n     Earth,--which are united to one another by that mystical bond, the\r\n     Sacrament of the Eucharist. The personages whom the Church has most\r\n     honoured for learning and holiness are ranged in picturesque and\r\n     animated groups on either side of the altar, on which the\r\n     consecrated wafer is exposed. St. Augustine dictates his thoughts\r\n     to one of his disciples; St. Gregory, in his pontifical robes,\r\n     seems absorbed in the contemplation of celestial glory; St.\r\n     Ambrose, in a slightly different attitude, appears to be chaunting\r\n     the Te Deum; while St. Jerome, seated, rests his hands on a large\r\n     book, which he holds on his knees. Pietro Lombardo, Duns Scotus,\r\n     St. Thomas Aquinas, Pope Anacletus, St. Buonaventura, and Innocent\r\n     III. are no less happily characterised; while, behind all these\r\n     illustrious men, whom the Church and succeeding generations have\r\n     agreed to honour, Raphael has ventured to introduce Dante with his\r\n     laurel crown, and, with still greater boldness, the monk\r\n     Savonarola, publicly burnt ten years before as a heretic.\r\n\r\n     \"In the glory, which forms the upper part of the picture, the Three\r\n     Persons of the Trinity are represented, surrounded by patriarchs,\r\n     apostles, and saints: it may, in fact, be considered in some sort\r\n     as a _resumé_ of all the favourite compositions produced during the\r\n     last hundred years by the Umbrian school. A great number of the\r\n     types, and particularly those of Christ and the Virgin, are to be\r\n     found in the earlier works of Raphael himself. The Umbrian\r\n     artists, from having so long exclusively employed themselves on\r\n     mystical subjects, had certainly attained to a marvellous\r\n     perfection in the representation of celestial beatitude, and of\r\n     those ineffable things of which it has been said that the heart of\r\n     man cannot conceive them, far less, therefore, the pencil of man\r\n     pourtray; and Raphael, surpassing them in all, and even in this\r\n     instance while surpassing himself, appears to have fixed the\r\n     limits, beyond which Christian art, properly so called, has never\r\n     since been able to advance.\"--_Rio. Poetry of Christian Art._\r\n\r\nThe _Stanza of the Incendio del Borgo_ is decorated with frescoes\r\nillustrative of the triumphs of the Church from events in the reigns of\r\nLeo III. and Leo IV.

In the background Leo IV. is seen in the portico of the old\r\n     St. Peter's arresting with a cross the progress of the flames, on\r\n     their approach to the basilica. In the foreground is a group of\r\n     fugitives, by _Giulio Romano_, resembling Æneas escaping from Troy\r\n     with Anchises, followed by Ascanius and Creusa. Beneath are Godfrey\r\n     de Bouillon and Astulf (Ethelwolf), the latter with the\r\n     inscription: \"Astulphus Rex sub Leone IV. Pont.

Could he\r\n     breathe or see, but that Christ breathed beside him, or looked into\r\n     his eyes? Under every cypress avenue the angels walked; he had seen\r\n     their white robes,--whiter than the dawn,--at his bedside, as he\r\n     woke in early summer.

This\r\n     is the master-piece of the master, and perhaps second only to the\r\n     Transfiguration. It was painted for the monks of Ara Cœli, who\r\n     quarrelled with the artist, and shut up the picture. Afterwards\r\n     they commissioned Poussin to paint an altar-piece for their church,\r\n     and, instead of supplying him with fresh canvas, produced the\r\n     picture of Domenichino, and desired him to paint over it. Poussin\r\n     indignantly threw up his engagement, and made known the existence\r\n     of the picture, which was afterwards preserved in the church of S.\r\n     Girolamo della Carità, whence it was carried off by the French. St.\r\n     Jerome, dying at Bethlehem, is represented receiving the Last\r\n     Sacraments from St. Ephraim of Syria, while St. Paula kneels by his\r\n     side.\r\n\r\n     \"The Last Communion of St. Jerome is the subject of one of the most\r\n     celebrated pictures in the world,--the St. Jerome of Domenichino,\r\n     which has been thought worthy of being placed opposite to the\r\n     Transfiguration of Raphael, in the Vatican. The aged\r\n     saint,--feeble, emaciated, dying,--is borne in the arms of his\r\n     disciples to the chapel of his monastery, and placed within the\r\n     porch.[353] A young priest sustains him; St. Paula, kneeling,\r\n     kisses one of his thin bony hands; the saint fixes his eager eyes\r\n     on the countenance of the priest, who is about to administer the\r\n     Sacrament,--a noble, dignified figure in a rich ecclesiastical\r\n     dress; a deacon holds the cup, and an attendant priest the book;\r\n     the lion droops his head with an expression of grief;[354] the eyes\r\n     and attention of all are on the dying saint, while four angels,\r\n     hovering above, look down upon the scene.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\n     \"And Jerome's death (A.D. 420) drawing near, he commanded that he\r\n     should be laid on the bare ground and covered with sackcloth, and\r\n     calling the brethren around him, he spake sweetly to them, and\r\n     exhorted them in many holy words, and appointed Eusebius to be\r\n     their abbot in his room. And then, with tears, he received the\r\n     blessed Eucharist, and sinking backwards again on the earth, his\r\n     hands crossed on his heart, he sung the 'Nunc Dimittis,' which\r\n     being finished, it being the hour of compline, suddenly a great\r\n     light, as of the noonday sun, shone round about him, within which\r\n     light angels innumerable were seen by the bystanders, in shifting\r\n     motion, like sparks among the dry reeds. And the voice of the\r\n     Saviour was heard, inviting him to heaven, and the holy Doctor\r\n     answered that he was ready. And after an hour, that light departed,\r\n     and Jerome's spirit with it.\"--_Lord Lindsay, from Peter de\r\n     Natalibus._\r\n\r\n     _Right Wall._--\"The Madonna di Foligno,\" _Raphael_, ordered in 1511\r\n     by Sigismondo Conti for the church of Ara Cœli (where he is\r\n     buried), and removed in 1565 to Foligno, when his great-niece, Anna\r\n     Conti, took the veil there at the convent of St' Anna. The angel in\r\n     the foreground bears a tablet, with the names of the painter and\r\n     donor, and the date 1512. The city of Foligno is seen in the\r\n     background, with a falling bomb, from which one may believe that\r\n     the picture was a votive offering from Sigismondo for an escape\r\n     during a siege. The picture was originally on panel, and was\r\n     transferred to canvas at Paris.\r\n\r\n     \"The Madonna di Foligno, however beautiful in the whole\r\n     arrangement, however excellent in the execution of separate parts,\r\n     appears to belong to a transition state of development. There is\r\n     something of the ecstatic enthusiasm which has produced such\r\n     peculiar conceptions and treatment of religious subjects in other\r\n     artists--Correggio, for example--and which, so far from harmonizing\r\n     with the unaffected serene grace of Raphael, has in this instance\r\n     led to some serious defects. This remark is particularly applicable\r\n     to the figures of St. John and St. Francis: the former looks out of\r\n     the picture with a fantastic action, and the drawing of his arm is\r\n     even considerably mannered. St. Francis has an expression of\r\n     fanatical ecstasy, and his countenance is strikingly weak in the\r\n     painting (composed of reddish, yellowish, and grey tones, which\r\n     cannot be wholly ascribed to their restorer). Again, St. Jerome\r\n     looks up with a sort of fretful expression, in which it is\r\n     difficult to recognise, as some do, a mournful resignation; there\r\n     is also an exaggerated style of drawing in the eyes, which\r\n     sometimes gives a sharpness to the expression of Raphael's figures,\r\n     and appears very marked in some of his other pictures. Lastly, the\r\n     Madonna and the Child, who turn to the donor, are in attitudes\r\n     which, however graceful, are not perhaps sufficiently tranquil for\r\n     the majesty of the queen of heaven. The expression of the Madonna's\r\n     countenance is extremely sweet, but with more of the character of a\r\n     mere woman than of a glorified being. The figure of the donor, on\r\n     the other hand, is excellent, with an expression of sincerity and\r\n     truth; the angel with the tablet is of unspeakable intensity and\r\n     exquisite beauty--one of the most marvellous figures that Raphael\r\n     has created.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     \"In the upper part of the composition sits the Virgin in heavenly\r\n     glory; by her side is the Infant Christ, partly sustained by his\r\n     mother's veil, which is drawn round his body: both look down\r\n     benignly on the votary, Sigismund Conti, who, kneeling below, gazes\r\n     up with an expression of the most intense gratitude and devotion.\r\n     It is a portrait from the life, and certainly one of the finest and\r\n     most life-like that exist in painting. Behind him stands St.\r\n     Jerome, who, placing his hand upon the head of the votary, seems to\r\n     present him to his celestial protectress. On the other side, John\r\n     the Baptist, the meagre wild-looking prophet of the desert, points\r\n     upward to the Redeemer. More in front kneels St. Francis, who,\r\n     while he looks up to heaven with trusting and imploring love,\r\n     extends his right hand towards the worshippers supposed to be\r\n     assembled in the church, recommending them also to the protecting\r\n     grace of the Virgin. In the centre of the picture, dividing these\r\n     two groups, stands a lovely angel-boy, holding in his hand a\r\n     tablet, one of the most charming figures of this kind Raphael ever\r\n     painted; the head, looking up, has that sublime, yet perfectly\r\n     childish grace, which strikes one in those awful angel-boys in the\r\n     'Madonna di San Sisto.' The background is a landscape, in which\r\n     appears the city of Foligno at a distance; it is overshadowed by a\r\n     storm-cloud, and a meteor is seen falling; but above these bends a\r\n     rainbow, pledge of peace and safety. The whole picture glows\r\n     throughout with life and beauty, hallowed by that profound\r\n     religious sentiment which suggested the offering, and which the\r\n     sympathetic artist seems to have caught from the grateful donor. It\r\n     was dedicated in the church of the Ara Cœli at Rome, which\r\n     belongs to the Franciscans, hence St. Francis is one of the\r\n     principal figures. When I was asked, at Rome, why St. Jerome had\r\n     been introduced into the picture, I thought it might be thus\r\n     accounted for:--The patron saint of the donor, St. Sigismund, was a\r\n     king and warrior, and Conti might possibly think it did not accord\r\n     with his profession, as a humble ecclesiastic, to introduce him\r\n     here. The most celebrated convent of the Jeronymites in Italy is\r\n     that of St. Sigismund, near Cremona, placed under the special\r\n     protection of St. Jerome, who is also in a general sense the patron\r\n     of all ecclesiastics; hence, perhaps, he figures here as the\r\n     protector of Sigismund Conti.\"--_Jameson's Legends of the Madonna_,\r\n     p. 103.\r\n\r\n     _Wall of Egress._--\"The Transfiguration:\" _Raphael_. The grandest\r\n     picture in the world. It was originally painted by order of\r\n     Cardinal Giulio de' Medici (afterwards Clement VII.) Archbishop of\r\n     Narbonne, for that provincial cathedral. But it was scarcely\r\n     finished when Raphael died, and it hung over his death-bed as he\r\n     lay in state, and was carried in his funeral procession.\r\n\r\n                      \"And when all beheld\r\n    Him where he lay, how changed from yesterday--\r\n    Him in that hour cut off, and at his head\r\n    His last great work; when, entering in, they look'd,\r\n    Now on the dead, then on that masterpiece--\r\n    Now on his face, lifeless and colourless,\r\n    Then on those forms divine that lived and breathed,\r\n    And would live on for ages--all were moved,\r\n    And sighs burst forth and loudest lamentations.\"\r\n\r\n    _Rogers._\r\n\r\n     The three following quotations may perhaps represent the practical,\r\n     æsthetical, and spiritual aspects of the picture.\r\n\r\n     \"It is somewhat strange to see the whole picture of the\r\n     Transfiguration--including the three apostles, prostrate on the\r\n     mount, shading their dazzled senses from the insufferable\r\n     brightness--occupying only a small part of the top of the canvas,\r\n     and the principal field filled with a totally distinct and\r\n     certainly unequalled picture--that of the demoniac boy, whom our\r\n     Saviour cured on coming down from the mount, after his\r\n     transfiguration. This was done in compliance with the _orders_ of\r\n     the monks of S. Pietro in Montorio, for which church it was\r\n     painted. It was the universal custom of the age--the yet unbanished\r\n     taste of Gothic days--to have two pictures, a celestial and a\r\n     terrestrial one, wholly unconnected with each other; accordingly,\r\n     we see few, even of the finest paintings, in which there is not a\r\n     heavenly subject above and an earthly below--for the great masters\r\n     of that day, like our own Shakspeare, were compelled to suit their\r\n     works to the taste of their employers.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"It must ever be matter of wonder that any one can have doubted of\r\n     the grand unity of such a conception as this. In the absence of the\r\n     Lord, the disconsolate parents bring a possessed boy to the\r\n     disciples of the Holy One. They seem to have been making attempts\r\n     to cast out the Evil Spirit; one has opened a book, to see whether\r\n     by chance any spell were contained in it which might be successful\r\n     against this plague, but in vain. At this moment appears He who\r\n     alone has the power, and appears transfigured in glory. They\r\n     remember His former mighty deeds; they instantly point aloft to the\r\n     vision as the only source of healing. How can the upper and lower\r\n     parts be separated? Both are one; beneath is Suffering craving for\r\n     Aid; above is active Power and helpful Grace. Both refer to one\r\n     another; both work in one another. Those who, in our dispute over\r\n     the picture, thought with me, confirmed their view by this\r\n     consideration: Raffaelle, they said, was ever distinguished by the\r\n     exquisite propriety of his conceptions. And is it likely that this\r\n     painter, thus gifted by God, and everywhere recognisable by the\r\n     excellence of this His gift, would in the full ripeness of his\r\n     powers have thought and painted wrongly? Not so; he is, as nature\r\n     is, ever right, and then most deeply and truly right when we least\r\n     suspect it.\"--_Goethe's Werke_, iii. p. 33.\r\n\r\n     \"In looking at the Transfiguration we must bear in mind that it is\r\n     not an historical but a devotional picture,--that the intention of\r\n     the painter was not to represent a scene, but to excite religious\r\n     feelings by expressing, so far as painting might do it, a very\r\n     sublime idea.\r\n\r\n     \"If we remove to a certain distance from the picture, so that the\r\n     forms shall become vague, indistinct, and only the masses of colour\r\n     and the light and shade perfectly distinguishable, we shall see\r\n     that the picture is indeed divided as if horizontally, the upper\r\n     half being all light, and the lower half comparatively all dark. As\r\n     we approach nearer, step by step, we behold above, the radiant\r\n     figure of the Saviour floating in mid-air, with arms outspread,\r\n     garments of transparent light, glorified visage upturned as if in\r\n     rapture, and the hair lifted and scattered as I have seen it in\r\n     persons under the influence of electricity. On the right, Moses; on\r\n     the left, Elijah; representing respectively the old Law and the old\r\n     Prophecies, which both testified of Him. The three disciples lie on\r\n     the ground, terror-struck, dazzled. There is a sort of eminence or\r\n     platform, but no perspective, no attempt at real locality, for the\r\n     scene is revealed as in a vision, and the same soft transparent\r\n     light envelopes the whole. This is the spiritual life, raised far\r\n     above the earth, but not yet in heaven. Below is seen the earthly\r\n     light, poor humanity struggling helplessly with pain, infirmity,\r\n     and death. The father brings his son, the possessed, or as we\r\n     should now say, the epileptic boy, who oftentimes falls into the\r\n     water, or into the fire, or lies grovelling on the earth, foaming\r\n     and gnashing his teeth; the boy struggles in his arms,--the rolling\r\n     eyes, the distorted features, the spasmodic limbs, are at once\r\n     terrible and pitiful to look on.\r\n\r\n     \"Such is the profound, the heart-moving significance of this\r\n     wonderful picture. It is, in truth, a fearful approximation of the\r\n     most opposite things; the mournful helplessness, suffering, and\r\n     degradation of human nature, the unavailing pity, are placed in\r\n     immediate contrast with spiritual light, life, hope,--nay, the very\r\n     fruition of heavenly rapture.\r\n\r\n     \"It has been asked, who are the two figures, the two saintly\r\n     deacons, who stand on each side of the upper group, and what have\r\n     they to do with the mystery above, or the sorrow below? Their\r\n     presence shows that the whole was conceived as a vision, or a poem.\r\n     The two saints are St. Laurence and St. Julian, placed there at the\r\n     request of the Cardinal de' Medici, for whom the picture was\r\n     painted, to be offered by him as an act of devotion as well as\r\n     munificence to his new bishopric; and these two figures commemorate\r\n     in a poetical way, not unusual at the time, his father, Lorenzo,\r\n     and his uncle, Giuliano de' Medici. They would be better away; but\r\n     Raphael, in consenting to the wish of his patron that they should\r\n     be introduced, left no doubt of the significance of the whole\r\n     composition, that it is placed before worshippers as a revelation\r\n     of the double life of earthly suffering and spiritual faith, as an\r\n     excitement to religious contemplation and religious hope.\r\n\r\n     \"In the Gospel, the Transfiguration of Our Lord is first described,\r\n     then the gathering of the people and the appeal of the father in\r\n     behalf of his afflicted son. They appear to have been simultaneous;\r\n     but painting only could have placed them before our eyes, at the\r\n     same moment, in all their suggestive contrast. It will be said that\r\n     in the brief record of the Evangelist, this contrast is nowhere\r\n     indicated, but the painter found it there and was right to use\r\n     it,--just the same as if a man should choose a text from which to\r\n     preach a sermon, and, in doing so, should evolve from the inspired\r\n     words many teachings, many deep reasonings, besides those most\r\n     obvious and apparent.\r\n\r\n     \"But, after we have prepared ourselves to understand and to take\r\n     into our heads all that this wonderful picture can suggest,\r\n     considered as an emanation of the mind, we find that it has other\r\n     interests for us, considered merely as a work of art. It was the\r\n     last picture which came from Raphael's hand; he was painting on it\r\n     when he was seized with his last illness. He had completed all the\r\n     upper part of the composition, all the ethereal vision, but the\r\n     lower part of it was still unfinished, and in this state the\r\n     picture was hung over his bier; when, after his death, he was laid\r\n     out in his painting-room, and all his pupils and friends, and the\r\n     people of Rome, came to look upon him for the last time; and when\r\n     those who stood round raised their eyes to the Transfiguration, and\r\n     then bent them on the lifeless form extended beneath it, 'every\r\n     heart was like to burst with grief (_faceva scoppiare l'anima di\r\n     dolore a ognuno che quivi guardava_), as, indeed, well it might.\r\n\r\n     \"Two-thirds of the price of the picture, 655 'ducati di camera,'\r\n     had already been paid by the Cardinal de' Medici, and, in the\r\n     following year, that part of the picture which Raphael had left\r\n     unfinished was completed by his pupil Giulio Romano, a powerful and\r\n     gifted, but not a refined or elevated, genius. He supplied what was\r\n     wanting in the colours and chiaroscuro according to Raphael's\r\n     design, but not certainly as Raphael himself would have done it.\r\n     The sum which Giulio received he bestowed as a dowry on his sister,\r\n     when he gave her in marriage to Lorenzetto the sculptor, who had\r\n     been a friend and pupil of Raphael. The cardinal did not send the\r\n     picture to Narbonne, but, unwilling to deprive Rome of such a\r\n     masterpiece, he presented it to the church of San Pietro in\r\n     Montorio, and sent in its stead the Raising of Lazarus, by\r\n     Sebastian del Piombo, now in our National Gallery. The French\r\n     carried off the Transfiguration to Paris in 1797, and when\r\n     restored, it was placed in the Vatican, where it now is.\"--_Mrs.\r\n     Jameson's History of Our Lord_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3rd Room._--\r\n\r\n     _Entrance Wall._--Madonna and Saints: _Titian_.\r\n\r\n     \"Titian's altar-piece is a specimen of his pictures of this class.\r\n     St. Nicholas, in full episcopal costume, is gazing upwards with an\r\n     air of inspiration. St. Peter is looking over his shoulder at a\r\n     book, and a beautiful St. Catherine is on the other side. Farther\r\n     behind, are St. Francis and St. Anthony of Padua; on the left St.\r\n     Sebastian, whose figure recurs in almost all of these pictures.\r\n     Above, in the clouds, with angels, is the Madonna, who looks\r\n     cheerfully on, while the lovely Child holds a wreath, as if ready\r\n     to crown a votary.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\n     \"In this picture there are three stages, or whatever they are\r\n     called, the same as in the Transfiguration. Below, saints and\r\n     martyrs are represented in suffering and abasement; on every face\r\n     is depicted sadness, nay, almost impatience; one figure in rich\r\n     episcopal robes looks upwards, with the most eager and agonized\r\n     longing, as if weeping, but he cannot see all that is floating\r\n     above his head, but which _we_ see, standing in front of the\r\n     picture. Above, Mary and her Child are in a cloud, radiant with\r\n     joy, and surrounded by angels, who have woven many garlands; the\r\n     Holy Child holds one of these, and seems as if about to crown the\r\n     saints beneath, but his Mother withholds his hand for the\r\n     moment(?). The contrast between the pain and suffering below,\r\n     whence St. Sebastian looks forth out of the picture with gloom and\r\n     almost apathy, and the lofty unalloyed exultation in the clouds\r\n     above, where crowns and palms are already awaiting him, is truly\r\n     admirable. High above the group of Mary hovers the Holy Spirit,\r\n     from whom emanates a bright streaming light, thus forming the apex\r\n     of the whole composition. I have just remembered that Goethe, at\r\n     the beginning of his first visit to Rome, describes and admires\r\n     this picture; and he speaks of it in considerable detail.

Near the figure of the\r\n     pope, Sixtus IV., who is known to Roman travellers from his\r\n     magnificent bronze tomb in the Chapel of the Sacrament at St.\r\n     Peter's, stand two of his nephews, of whom one is Giuliano della\r\n     Rovere, afterwards Julius II., and the other Pietro Riario, who,\r\n     from the position of a humble Franciscan monk, was raised, in a few\r\n     months, by his uncle, to be Bishop of Treviso, Cardinal-Archbishop\r\n     of Seville, Patriarch of Constantinople, Archbishop of Valentia,\r\n     and Archbishop of Florence, when his life changed, and he lived\r\n     with such extravagance, and gave banquets so magnificent, that\r\n     \"never had pagan antiquity seen anything like it;\"[355] but within\r\n     two years \"he died (not without suspicion of poison), to the great\r\n     grief of Pope Sixtus, and to the infinite joy of the whole college\r\n     of cardinals.\"[356] The kneeling figure represents Platina, the\r\n     historian of the popes and prefect of the Vatican library. In the\r\n     background stand two other nephews of the pope, Cardinal Giovanni\r\n     della Rovere, and Girolamo Riario, who was married by his uncle (or\r\n     father?), the pope, to the famous Caterina Sforza,--was suspected\r\n     of being the originator of the conspiracy of the Pazzi,--was\r\n     created Count of Forlì, and to whose aggrandisement Sixtus IV.\r\n     sacrificed every principle of morality and justice: he was murdered\r\n     at Forli, April 14th, 1488.

It is stigmatised by Kugler as \"an\r\n     unimportant and bad picture,\" but, perhaps from the connection of\r\n     the subject with the story of St Peter, has been thought worthy of\r\n     being copied in mosaic in the basilica, whence this picture was\r\n     brought.\r\n\r\n     \"This picture is terrible for dark and effective expression; it is\r\n     just one of those subjects in which the Caravaggio school\r\n     delighted.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\n     33.

The empress rejected\r\n     this gift with contempt: whereupon Gregory, to show that such\r\n     things are hallowed not so much in themselves as by the faith of\r\n     believers, laid the Brandeum on the altar, and after praying he\r\n     took up a knife and pierced it, and blood flowed as from a living\r\n     body.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art_, p. 321.\r\n\r\n     37.

Dorotea--Ponte Sisto.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the road which leads to the Temple of Vesta, &c., as far as\r\nthe Via Savelli, and then turning down past the gateway of the Orsini\r\npalace, with its two bears,--we reach the _Ponte Quattro Capi_.\r\n\r\nThis was the ancient Pons Fabricius, built of stone in the place of a\r\nwooden bridge, A.U.C. 733, by Fabricius, the Curator Viarum. It has two\r\narches, with a small ornamental one in the central pier. In the twelfth\r\ncentury the greater part was faced with brickwork. An inscription, only\r\npartly legible, remains. L. FABRICIUS. C. T. CUR. VIAR. FACIUNDUM.\r\nCURAVIT. EIDEMQ. PROBAVIT.--Q. LEPIDUS. M. F. M. LOLLIUS. M. F. COS. EX.\r\nS. C. PROBAVERUNT. From this inscription the inference has been drawn\r\nthat the senate always allowed forty years to elapse between the\r\ncompletion of a public work, and the grant to it of their public\r\napproval. This bridge, according to Horace, was a favourite spot with\r\nthose who wished to drown themselves; hence Damasippus would have leaped\r\ninto the Tiber, if it were not for the precepts of the stoic Stertinius:\r\n\r\n                            \"Unde ego mira\r\n    Descripsi docilis præcepta hæc, tempore quo me\r\n    Solatus jussit sapientem pascere barbam,\r\n    Atque a Fabricio non tristem ponte reverti.\"\r\n\r\n    _Horace, Sat._ ii. 3.\r\n\r\nThe name of the bridge changed with time to \"Pons Tarpeius\" and \"Pons\r\nJudæorum,\" from the neighbouring Ghetto. It is now called Ponte Quattro\r\nCapi, from two busts of the four-headed Janus, which adorn its parapet,\r\nand are supposed to have come from the temple of \"Janus Geminus,\" which\r\nstood in this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOn crossing this bridge, we are on the Island in the Tiber, the\r\nformation of which is ascribed by tradition to the produce of the\r\ncorn-fields of the Tarquins (cast contemptuously upon the waters after\r\ntheir expulsion), which accumulated here, till soil gathered around\r\nthem, and a solid piece of land was formed. Of this, Ampère says:\r\n\r\n     \"L'effet du courant rapide du fleuve est plutôt de détruire les\r\n     îles que d'en former. C'est ainsi qu'une petite île a été entraînée\r\n     par la violence des eaux en 1718.\"--_Histoire Romaine à Rome._\r\n\r\nOn this island, anciently known as the _Isola Tiberina_, were three\r\ntemples,--those, namely, of Æsculapius:\r\n\r\n    \"Unde Coroniden circumflua Tibridis alveo\r\n    Insula Romuleæ sacris adsciverit urbis.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Metam._ xv. 624.\r\n\r\n    \"Accepit Phœbo Nymphaque Coronide natum\r\n    Insula, dividua quam premit amnis aqua.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ i. 291.\r\n\r\nof Jupiter:\r\n\r\n    \"Jupiter in parte est, cepit locus unus utrumque:\r\n    Junctaque sunt magno templa nepotis avo.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ i. 293.\r\n\r\nand of Faunus:\r\n\r\n    \"Idibus agrestis fumant altaria Fauni,\r\n    Hic ubi discretas insula rumpit aquas.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ ii. 193.\r\n\r\nHere also was an altar to the Sabine god Semo-Sancus, whose inscription,\r\nlegible in the early centuries of Christianity, led various\r\necclesiastical authors into the error that the words \"Semoni Sanco\"\r\nreferred to Simon Magus.[357]\r\n\r\nIn imperial times the island was used as a prison: among remarkable\r\nprisoners immured here was Arvandus, Prefect of Gaul, A.D. 468. In the\r\nreign of Claudius sick slaves were exposed and left to die here,--that\r\nemperor--by a strange contradiction in one who caused fallen gladiators\r\nto be butchered \"for the pleasure of seeing them die\"--making a law that\r\nany slave so exposed should receive his liberty if he recovered. In the\r\nmiddle ages the island was under the jurisdiction of the Cardinal Bishop\r\nof Porto, who lived in the Franciscan convent. Under Leo X. a fête was\r\nheld here in which Camillo Querno, the papal poet, was crowned with ivy,\r\nlaurel, and cabbage (!). In 1656 the whole island was appropriated as a\r\nhospital for those stricken with the plague,--a singular coincidence for\r\nthe site of the temple of Æsculapius.\r\n\r\nThe first building on the left, after passing the bridge, is a fine\r\nbrick tower, of great historic interest, as the only relic of a castle,\r\nbuilt by the family of the Anicii, of which St. Gregory the Great was a\r\nmember, and two of whom were consuls together under Honorius:\r\n\r\n    \"Est in Romuleo procumbens insula Tibri,\r\n    Qua medius geminas interfluit alveus urbes,\r\n    Discretas subeunte freto, pariterque minantes\r\n    Ardua turrigeræ surgunt in culmina ripæ.\r\n    Hic stetit et subitum prospexit ab aggere votum.\r\n    Unanimes fratres junctos stipante senatu\r\n    Ire forum, strictasque procul radiare secures,\r\n    Atque uno bijuges tolli de limine fasces.\"\r\n\r\n    _Claudius, Paneg. in Prob. et Olyb. Cons._ 226.\r\n\r\nFrom the Anicii the castle passed to the Gaetani. It was occupied as a\r\nfortress by the Countess Matilda, after she had driven the faction of\r\nthe anti-pope Guibert out of the island, and was the refuge where two\r\nsuccessive popes, Victor III. and Urban II., lived under her\r\nprotection.[358]\r\n\r\nThe centre of the island is now occupied by the _Church and Convent of\r\nS. Bartolomeo_, which gives it its present name.\r\n\r\nThe piazza in front of the church is occupied by a pillar, erected at\r\nthe private expense of Pius IX., to commemorate the opening of the\r\nVatican Council of 1869--70,--adorned with statues of St. Bartholomew,\r\nSt. Paulinus of Nola, St. Francis, and S. Giovanni di Dio. Here formerly\r\nstood an ancient obelisk (the only one of unknown origin). A fragment of\r\nit was long preserved at the Villa Albani, whence it is said to have\r\nbeen removed to Urbino. The church, a basilica, was founded by Otho III.\r\n_c._ 1000; its campanile dates from 1118. The nave and aisles are\r\ndivided by red granite columns, said to be relics of the ancient\r\ntemple,--as is a marble well-head under the stairs leading to the\r\ntribune. This was restored in 1798, and dedicated to St. Adalbert of\r\nGnesen, who bestowed upon the church its great relic, the body of St.\r\nBartholomew, which he asserted to have brought from Beneventum, though\r\nthe inhabitants of that town profess that they still possess the _real_\r\nbody of the apostle, and sent that of St. Paulinus of Nola to Rome\r\ninstead. The dispute about the possession of this relic ran so high as\r\nto lead to a siege of Beneventum in the middle ages. The convent belongs\r\nto the Franciscans (Frati-Minori), who will admit male visitors into\r\ntheir pretty little garden at the end of the island, to see the remains\r\nof\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Æsculapius, built after the great plague in Rome, in B.C.\r\n291, when, in accordance with the advice of the Sibylline books,\r\nambassadors were sent to Epidaurus to bring Æsculapius to Rome;--they\r\nreturned with a statue of the god, but as their vessel sailed up the\r\nTiber, a serpent, which had lain concealed during the voyage, glided\r\nfrom it, and landed on this spot, hailed by the people under the belief\r\nthat Æsculapius himself had thus come to them. In consequence of this\r\nstory the form of a ship was given to this end of the island, and its\r\nbow may still be seen at the end of the convent garden, with the famous\r\nserpent of Æsculapius sculptured upon it in high relief.[359] The\r\ncurious remains still existing are not of sufficient size to bear out\r\nthe assertion often made that the whole island was enclosed in the\r\ntravertine form of a ship, of which the temple of Jupiter at the other\r\nend afterwards formed the prow, and the obelisk the mast.\r\n\r\n     \"Pendant les guerres Samnites, Rome fut de nouveau frappée par une\r\n     de ces maladies auxquelles elle était souvent en proie; celle-ci\r\n     dura trois années. On eut recours aux livres Sibyllins. En cas\r\n     pareil ils avaient prescrit de consacrer un temple à Apollon; cette\r\n     fois ils prescrivirent d'aller à Epidaure chercher le fils\r\n     d'Apollon, Esculape, et de l'amener à Rome. Esculape, sous la forme\r\n     d'un serpent, fut transporté d'Epidaure dans l'île Tibérine, où on\r\n     lui éleva un temple, et où ont été trouvés des _ex-voto_,\r\n     représentant des bras, des jambes, diverses autres parties du corps\r\n     humain, _ex-votos_ qu'on eût pu croire provenir d'une église de\r\n     Rome, car le catholicisme romain a adopté cet usage païen sans y\r\n     rien changer.\r\n\r\n     \"Pourquoi place-t-on le temple d'Esculape en cet endroit? On a vu\r\n     que l'île Tibérine avait été très-anciennement consacrée au culte\r\n     d'un dieu des Latins primitifs, Faunus; or ce dieu rendait ses\r\n     oracles près des sources thermales; its devaient avoir souvent pour\r\n     l'objet la guérison des malades qui venaient demander la santé à\r\n     ces sources. De plus, les malades consultaient Esculape dans les\r\n     songes par incubation, comme dans l'Ovide, Numa va consulter Faunus\r\n     sur l'Aventin. Il n'est donc pas surprenant qu'on ait institué le\r\n     culte du dieu grec de la santé, là où le dieu latin Faunus rendait\r\n     ses oracles dans des songes, et où étaient probablement des sources\r\n     d'eau chaude qui ont disparu comme les _lautulæ_ près du Forum\r\n     romain.\r\n\r\n     \"On donna à l'île la forme d'un vaisseau, plus tard un obélisque\r\n     figura le mât; en la regardant du Ponte Rotto, on reconnaît encore\r\n     très bien cette forme, de ce côté, on voit sculpté sur le mur qui\r\n     figure le vaisseau d'Esculape une image du dieu avec un serpent\r\n     entortillé autour de son sceptre. La belle statue d'Esculape, venue\r\n     des jardins Farnèse, passe pour avoir été celle de l'île Tibérine.\r\n     Un temple de Jupiter touchait à ce temple d'Esculape.\r\n\r\n     \"Un jour que je visitais ce lieu, le sacristain de l'église de St.\r\n     Barthélemy me dit, '_Al tempo d'Esculapio quando Giove regnava._'\r\n     Phrase singulière, et qui montre encore vivante une sorte de foi au\r\n     paganisme chez les Romains.\"--_Ampère_, iii. 42.\r\n\r\nOpposite S. Bartolomeo, on the site of the temple of Faunus, is the\r\n_Hospital of S. Giovanni Calabita_, also called _Benfratelli_, entirely\r\nunder the care of the brethren of S. Giovanni di Dio, who cook, nurse,\r\nwash, and otherwise do all the work of those who pass under their care,\r\noften to the number of 1200 in the course of the year, though the\r\nhospital is very small.\r\n\r\n     \"C'est à Pie V. que les frères de l'ordre de la _Charité_, institué\r\n     par saint Jean de Dieu, durent leur premier établissement à Rome.\r\n\r\n     \"Au milieu du cortége triomphal qui accompagnait don Juan\r\n     d'Autriche (1571), lors de son retour de Lépante, on remarquait un\r\n     pauvre homme misérablement vêtu et à l'attitude modeste. Il se\r\n     nommait Sébastien Arias _des frères de Jean de Dieu_. Jean de Dieu\r\n     était mort sans laisser d'autre règle à ses disciples que ces\r\n     touchantes paroles qu'il répétait sans cesse, _faites le bien, mes\r\n     frères_; et Sébastien d'Arias venait à Rome pour demander au pape\r\n     l'autorisation de former des couvents et d'avoir des hospices où\r\n     ils pussent suivre les exemples de dévouement que leur avait\r\n     laissés Jean de Dieu. Or, Sébastien rencontra don Juan à Naples, et\r\n     le vainqueur de Lépante le prit avec lui. Il se chargea même\r\n     d'appuyer sa requête, et Pie V. s'empressa d'accorder aux frères\r\n     non-seulement la bulle qu'ils désiraient, mais encore un monastère\r\n     dans l'île du Tibre.\"--_Gournerie_, _Rome Chrétienne_, ii. 206.\r\n\r\nA narrow lane near this leads to the other end of the island, where the\r\ntemple of Jupiter stood. It is worth while to go thither for the sake of\r\nthe view of the river and its bridges, which is to be obtained from a\r\nlittle quay leading to one of the numerous water-mills which exist near\r\nthis. These floating _Mills_ (which bear sacred monograms upon their\r\ngables) are interesting as having been invented by Belisarius in order\r\nto supply the people and garrison with bread, during the siege of Rome\r\nby Vitiges, when the Goths had cut the aqueducts, and thus rendered the\r\nmills on the Janiculan useless.\r\n\r\nThe bridge, of one large and two smaller arches, which connects the\r\nisland with the Trastevere, is now called the _Ponte S. Bartolomeo_, but\r\nwas anciently the Pons Cestius, or Gratianus, built A.U.C. 708, by the\r\nPrætor Lucius Cestius, who was probably father to the Caius Cestius\r\nburied near the Porta S. Paolo. It was restored A.D. 370 by the emperors\r\nValentinian, Valens, and Gratian, as is seen from the fragments of a\r\nred letter inscription on the inside of the parapet, in which the title\r\n\"Pontifex Maximus\" is ascribed to each--\"a tide accepted without\r\nhesitation,\" says Gibbon, \"by seven Christian emperors, who were\r\ninvested with more absolute authority over the religion they had\r\ndeserted, than over that which they professed.\"\r\n\r\nWe now enter _the Trastevere_, the city \"across the Tiber,\"--the portion\r\nof Rome which is most unaltered from mediæval times, and whose narrow\r\nstreets are still overlooked by many ancient towers, gothic windows, and\r\ncurious fragments of sculpture. The inhabitants on this side differ in\r\nmany respects from those on the other side of the Tiber. They pride\r\nthemselves upon being born \"Trasteverini,\" profess to be the direct\r\ndescendants of the ancient Romans, seldom intermarry with their\r\nneighbours, and speak a dialect peculiarly their own. It is said that in\r\ntheir dispositions also they differ from the other Romans, that they are\r\na far more hasty, passionate, and revengeful, as they are a stronger and\r\nmore vigorous race. The proportion of murders (a crime far less common\r\nin Rome than in England) is larger in this than in any other part of the\r\ncity. This, it is believed, is partly due to the extreme excitement\r\nwhich the Trasteverini display in the pursuit of their national games,\r\nespecially that of Morrà:--\r\n\r\n     \"Morrà is played by the men, and merely consists in holding up, in\r\n     rapid succession, any number of fingers they please, calling out at\r\n     the same time the number their antagonist shows. Nothing,\r\n     seemingly, can be more simple or less interesting. Yet, to see them\r\n     play, so violent are their gestures, that you would imagine them\r\n     possessed by some diabolical passion. The eagerness and rapidity\r\n     with which they carry it on render it very liable to mistake and\r\n     altercation; then frenzy fires them, and too often furious disputes\r\n     arise at this trivial play that end in murder. Morrà seems to\r\n     differ in no respect from the _Micare Digitis_ of the ancient\r\n     Romans.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nA house with gothic windows on the right, soon after passing the bridge,\r\nis pointed out as that once inhabited by the _Fornarina_, beloved of\r\nRaphael, and so well known to us from his portrait of her in the Tribune\r\nat Florence.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Via Longarina, we find ourselves in the little piazza of\r\n_S. Benedetto a Piscinuola_, where there is a tiny church, with a good\r\nbrick campanile intersected by terra-cotta mouldings, which occupies the\r\nsite of the house inhabited by St. Benedict before his retreat to\r\nSubiaco. The exterior is uninviting, but the interior very curious; an\r\natrium with antique columns opens to a vaulted chapel (of the same\r\ndesign as the Orto del Paradiso at Sta. Prassede), in which is a picture\r\nof the Virgin and Child, revered as that before which St. Benedict was\r\nwont to pray. Hence is entered the cell of the saint, of rough-hewn\r\nstones. His stone pillow is shown.\r\n\r\nThe church has ancient pillars, and a rich opus-alexandrinum pavement.\r\n\r\n     \"Over the high altar is a picture--full-length--of St. Benedict,\r\n     which Mabillon ('Iter Italicum') considers a genuine contemporary\r\n     portrait--though Nibby and other critics suppose it less ancient.\r\n     The figure on gold background is seated in a chair with gothic\r\n     carvings, such as were in mediæval use; the black cowl is drawn\r\n     over the head, the hair and beard are white; the aspect is serious\r\n     and thoughtful, in one hand a crozier, in the other the book of\r\n     rules drawn up by the Saint, displaying the words with which they\r\n     begin: 'Ausculta fili precepta magistri.\"--_Hemans' Ancient Sacred\r\n     Art._\r\n\r\nTurning down the Via Longarina towards the river, we pass, on the left,\r\nconsiderable remains of the old mediæval _Castle of the Alberteschi\r\nFamily_, consisting of a block of palatial buildings of handsome\r\nmasonry, with numerous antique fragments built into them, and a very\r\nrich porch sculptured with egg and billet mouldings of _c._ A.D. 1150,\r\nand beyond these, separated from them by a modern street, a high brick\r\ntower of _c._ A.D. 1100. Above one of the windows of this tower, a head\r\nof Jupiter is engrafted in the wall.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the entrance of the Ponte Rotto (described Chap. V.). Close\r\nto this bridge is the Church of _S. Crispino al Ponte_ (the saint is\r\nburied at S. Lorenzo Pane e Perna). The front is modernized, but the\r\neast end displays rich terra-cotta cornices, and is very picturesque. On\r\nthe river bank below this are the colossal lions' heads mentioned in\r\nChap. V.\r\n\r\nTurning up the Via dei Vascellari, we pass on the right, the ancient\r\n_Palace of the Ponziani Family_, once magnificent, but now of humble and\r\nrude exterior, and scarcely to be distinguished, except in March, during\r\nthe festa of Sta. Francesca Romana, when old tapestries are hung out\r\nupon its white-washed walls, and the street in front is thickly strewn\r\nwith box-leaves.\r\n\r\n     \"The modern building that has been raised on the foundation of the\r\n     old palace is the Casa dei Esercizii Pii, for the young men of the\r\n     city. There the repentant sinner who longs to break the chain of\r\n     sin, the youth beset by some strong temptation, one who has heard\r\n     the inward voice summoning him to higher paths of virtue, another\r\n     who is in doubt as to the particular line of life to which he is\r\n     called, may come, and leave behind him for three, or five, or ten\r\n     days, as it may be, the busy world, with all its distractions and\r\n     its agitations, and, free for the time being from temporal cares,\r\n     the wants of the body being provided for, and the mind at rest, may\r\n     commune with God and their own souls.\r\n\r\n     \"Over the Casa dei Esercizii Pii the sweet spirit of Francesca\r\n     seems still to preside. On the day of her festival its rooms are\r\n     thrown open, every memorial of the gentle saint is exhibited,\r\n     lights burn on numerous altars, flowers deck the passages, leaves\r\n     are strewn in the chapel, on the stairs, in the entrance-court; gay\r\n     carpets, figured tapestry, and crimson silks hang over the door,\r\n     and crowds of people go in and out, and kneel before the relics or\r\n     the pictures of the dear saint of Rome. It is a touching festival,\r\n     which carries back the mind to the day when the young bride of\r\n     Lorenzo Ponziano entered these walls for the first time, in all the\r\n     sacred beauty of holiness and youth.\"--_Lady G. Fullerton._\r\n\r\nIn this house, also, Sta. Francesca Romana died, having come hither from\r\nher convent to nurse her son who was ill, and having been then seized\r\nwith mortal illness herself.\r\n\r\n     \"Touching were the last words of the dying mother to her spiritual\r\n     children: 'Love, love,' was the burden of her teaching, as it had\r\n     been that of the beloved disciple. 'Love one another,' she said,\r\n     'and be faithful unto death. Satan will assault you, as he has\r\n     assaulted me, but be not afraid. You will overcome him through\r\n     patience and obedience; and no trial will be too grievous, if you\r\n     are united to Jesus; if you walk in His ways, He will be with you.'\r\n     On the seventh day of her illness, as she had herself announced,\r\n     her life came to a close. A sublime expression animated her face, a\r\n     more ethereal beauty clothed her earthly form. Her confessor for\r\n     the last time inquired what it was her enraptured eyes beheld, and\r\n     she answered, 'The heavens open! the angels descend! the angel has\r\n     finished his task. He stands before me. He beckons me to follow\r\n     him.' These were the last words Francesca uttered.\"--_Lady G.\r\n     Fullerton's Life of Sta. F. Romana._\r\n\r\nAlmost opposite the Ponziani Palace, an alley leads to the small chapel\r\nof _Sta. Maria in Cappella_, which has a good brick campanile, dating\r\nfrom 1090. This building is attached to a hospital for poor women ill of\r\nincurable diseases, attended by sisters of charity, and entirely under\r\nthe patronage of the Doria family.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the front of the _Convent and Church of Sta. Cecilia_\r\n(facing which is a picturesque mediæval house), in many ways one of the\r\nmost interesting buildings in the city.\r\n\r\nCecilia was a noble and rich Roman lady, who lived in the reign of\r\nAlexander Severus. She was married at sixteen to Valerian, a heathen,\r\nwith whom she lived in perpetual virginity, telling him that her\r\nguardian angel watched over her by day and night.\r\n\r\n    \"I have an angel which thus loveth me--\r\n    That with great love, whether I wake or sleep,\r\n    Is ready aye my body for to keep.\"\r\n\r\n    _Chaucer._\r\n\r\nAt length Valerian and his brother Tiburtius were converted to\r\nChristianity by her prayers, and the exhortations of Pope Urban I. The\r\nhusband and brother were beheaded for refusing to sacrifice to idols,\r\nand Cecilia was shortly afterwards condemned by Almachius, prefect of\r\nRome, who was covetous of the great wealth she had inherited by their\r\ndeaths. She was first shut up in the _Sudatorium_ of her own baths, and\r\na blazing fire was lighted, that she might be destroyed by the hot\r\nvapours. But when the bath was opened, she was found still living, \"for\r\nGod,\" says the legend, \"had sent a cooling shower, which had tempered\r\nthe heat of the fire, and preserved the life of the saint.\" Almachius,\r\nthen, who dreaded the consequences of bringing so noble and courageous a\r\nvictim to public execution, sent a lictor to behead her in her own\r\npalace, but he executed his office so ill, that she still lived after\r\nthe third blow of his axe, after which the Roman law forbade that a\r\nvictim should be stricken again. \"The Christians found her bathed in her\r\nblood, and during three days she still preached and taught, like a\r\ndoctor of the Church, with such sweetness and eloquence, that four\r\nhundred pagans were converted. On the third day she was visited by Pope\r\nUrban, to whose care she tenderly committed the poor whom she nourished,\r\nand to him she bequeathed the palace in which she had lived, that it\r\nmight be consecrated as a temple to the Saviour. Then, \"thanking God\r\nthat he considered her, a humble woman, worthy to share the glory of his\r\nheroes, and with her eyes apparently fixed upon the heavens opening\r\nbefore her, she departed to her heavenly bridegroom, upon the 22nd\r\nNovember, A.D. 280.\"\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the church dates from its consecration by Pope Urban\r\nI., after the death of St. Cecilia, but it was rebuilt by Paschal I. in\r\n821, and miserably modernized by Cardinal Doria in 1725. The exterior\r\nretains its ancient campanile of 1120, and its atrium of marble pillars,\r\nevidently collected from pagan edifices and surmounted by a frieze of\r\nmosaic, in which medallion heads of Cecilia, Valerian, Tiburtius, Urban\r\nI., and others are introduced. In the courtyard of the convent, which\r\nbelongs to Benedictine nuns, is a fine specimen of the Roman vase called\r\nCantharus, perhaps coeval with St. Cecilia's own residence here.\r\n\r\nRight of the door, on entering, is the tomb of Adam of Hertford, Bishop\r\nof London, who died 1398, the only one spared from a cruel death, of the\r\ncardinals who conspired against Urban VI., and were taken prisoners at\r\nLucera--from fear of King John who was his friend. His sarcophagus is\r\nadorned with the arms of England, then three leopards and fleurs-de-lis\r\nquartered. On the opposite side of the entrance is the tomb of Cardinal\r\nFortiguerra, conspicuous in the contests of Pius II. and Paul II. with\r\nthe Malatestas and Savellis in the fifteenth century. The drapery is a\r\nbeautiful specimen of the delicate carving of detail during that period.\r\n\r\nThe altar canopy, which bears the name of its artist, Arnolphus, and the\r\ndate 1286, is a fine specimen of gothic work, and has statuettes of\r\nCecilia, Valerian, Tiburtius, and Urban. Beneath the altar is the famous\r\nstatue of St. Cecilia.\r\n\r\nIn the archives of the Vatican remains an account written by Pope\r\nPaschal I. (A.D. 817--24) himself, describing how, \"yielding to the\r\ninfirmity of the flesh,\" he fell asleep in his chair during the early\r\nmorning service at St. Peter's, with his mind pre-occupied with a\r\nlonging to find the burial-place of Cecilia, and discover her relics.\r\nThen in a glorified vision the virgin-saint appeared before him, and\r\nrevealed the spot where she lay, with her husband and brother-in-law, in\r\nthe catacomb of Calixtus, and there they were found, and transported to\r\nher church on the following day.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, Sfondrato, titular cardinal of the church,\r\nopened the tomb of the martyr, when the embalmed body of Cecilia was\r\nfound, as it had been previously found by Paschal, robed in gold tissue,\r\nwith linen clothes steeped in blood at her feet, \"not lying upon the\r\nback, like a body in a tomb, but upon its right side, like a virgin in\r\nher bed, with her knees modestly drawn together, and offering the\r\nappearance of sleep.\" Pope Clement VIII. and all the people of Rome\r\nrushed to look upon the saint, who was afterwards enclosed as she was\r\nfound, in a shrine of cypress wood cased in silver. But before she was\r\nagain hidden from sight, the greatest artist of the day, Stefano\r\nMaderno, was called in by Sfondrato, to sculpture the marble portrait\r\nwhich we now see lying upon her grave. Sfondrato (whose tomb is in this\r\nchurch) also enriched her shrine with the ninety-six silver lamps which\r\nburn constantly before it. In regarding this statue it will be\r\nremembered that Cecilia was not beheaded, but wounded in the throat,--a\r\ngold circlet conceals the wound.\r\n\r\n     In the statue \"the body lies on its side, the limbs a little drawn\r\n     up; the hands are delicate and fine,--they are not locked, but\r\n     crossed at the wrists: the arms are stretched out. The drapery is\r\n     beautifully modelled, and modestly covers the limbs.... It is the\r\n     statue of a lady, perfect in form, and affecting from the\r\n     resemblance to reality in the drapery of white marble, and the\r\n     unspotted appearance of the statue altogether. It lies as no living\r\n     body could lie, and yet correctly, as the dead when left to\r\n     expire,--I mean in the gravitation of the limbs.\"--_Sir C. Bell._\r\n\r\n     The inscription says: \"Behold the body of the most holy virgin\r\n     Cecilia, whom I myself saw lying incorrupt in her tomb. I have in\r\n     this marble expressed for thee the same saint in the very same\r\n     posture of body.\"\r\n\r\nThe tribune is adorned with mosaics of the ninth century, erected in the\r\nlifetime of Paschal I. (see his _square_ nimbus). The Saviour is seen in\r\nthe act of benediction, robed in gold: at his side are SS. Peter and\r\nPaul, St. Cecilia and St. Valerian, St. Paschal I. carrying the model of\r\nhis church, and St. Agatha, whom he joined with Cecilia in its\r\ndedication. The mystic palm-trees and the phœnix, the emblem of\r\neternity, are also represented, and, beneath, the four rivers, and the\r\ntwelve sheep, emblematical of the apostles, issuing from the gates of\r\nBethlehem and Jerusalem, to the adoration of the spotless Lamb. The\r\npicture of St. Cecilia behind the altar is attributed to _Guido_.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the right aisle is an ancient fresco representing the\r\ndream of Pope Paschal,--the (mitred) pope asleep upon his throne, and\r\nthe saint appearing before him in a rich robe adorned with gems. This is\r\nthe last of a series of frescoes which once existed in the portico of\r\nthe church. The rest were destroyed in the seventeenth century. There\r\nare copies of them in the Barberini Library, viz.\r\n\r\n    1. The marriage feast of Valerian and Cecilia.\r\n    2. Cecilia persuades Valerian to seek for St. Urban.\r\n    3. Valerian rides forth to seek for Urban.\r\n    4. Valerian is baptized.\r\n    5. An Angel crowns Cecilia and Valerian.\r\n    6. Cecilia converts her executioners.\r\n    7. Cecilia suffers in the bath.\r\n    8. The Martyrdom of Cecilia.\r\n    9. The Burial of Cecilia.\r\n    10. The dream of Paschal.\r\n\r\nOpening out of the same aisle are two chambers in the house of St.\r\nCecilia, one the sudatorium of her baths, in which she was immured,\r\nactually retaining the pipes and calorifers of an ancient Roman bath.\r\n\r\nThe Festa of St. Cecilia is observed in this church on November 22nd,\r\nwhen--\r\n\r\n    --\"rapt Cecilia, seraph-haunted queen of harmony\"--[360]\r\n\r\nis honoured in beautiful music from the papal choir assembled here.\r\nVisitors to Bologna will recollect the glorious figure of St. Cecilia by\r\nRaphael, rapt in ecstasy, and surrounded by instruments of music. This\r\nassociation with Cecilia probably arises from the tradition of the\r\nchurch, which tells how Valerian, returning from baptism by Pope Urban,\r\nfound her singing hymns of triumph for his conversion, of which he had\r\nsupposed her to be ignorant, and that when the bath was opened after\r\nher three days' imprisonment, she was again found singing the praises of\r\nher Saviour.\r\n\r\nIt is said that \"she sang with such ravishing sweetness, that even the\r\nangels descended from heaven to listen to her, or to join their voices\r\nwith hers.\"\r\n\r\nThe antiphons sung upon her festival are:\r\n\r\n     \"And Cecilia, thy servant, serves thee, O Lord, even as the bee\r\n     that is never idle.\r\n\r\n     \"I bless thee, O Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for through thy\r\n     Son the fire hath been quenched round about me.\r\n\r\n     \"I asked of the Lord a respite of three days, that I might\r\n     consecrate my house as a church.\r\n\r\n     \"O Valerian, I have a secret to tell thee; I have for my lover an\r\n     angel of God, who, with great jealousy, watches over my body.\r\n\r\n     \"The glorious virgin ever bore the Gospel of Christ in her bosom,\r\n     and neither by day nor night ceased from conversing with God in\r\n     prayer.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the anthem:\r\n\r\n     \"While the instruments of music were playing, Cecilia sang unto the\r\n     Lord, and said, Let my heart be undefiled, that I may never be\r\n     confounded.\r\n\r\n     \"And Valerianus found Cecilia praying in her chamber with an\r\n     angel.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Cecilia is one of the chosen saints _daily_\r\ncommemorated in the canon of the mass.\r\n\r\n     \"Nobis quoque peccatoribus famulis tuis, de multitudine\r\n     miserationum tuarum sperantibus, partem aliquam et societatem\r\n     donare digneris cum tuis sanctis Apostolis et Martyribus: cum\r\n     Joanne, Stephano, Matthia, Barnaba, Ignatio, Alexandro, Marcellino,\r\n     Petro, Felicitate, Perpetua, Agata, Lucia, Agnete, _Cæcilia_,\r\n     Anastasia, et omnibus sanctis.\"\r\n\r\nJust beyond St. Cecilia is the immense _Hospital of S. Michele_, founded\r\nby Cardinal Odescalchi, nephew of Innocent XI., in 1693, as a refuge for\r\nvagabond children, where they might be properly brought up and taught a\r\ntrade. Innocent XII. (Pignatelli) added to this foundation a hospital\r\nfor sick persons of both sexes, and each succeeding pope has increased\r\nthe buildings and their endowment. The establishment is now divided into\r\nan asylum for old men and women, a school with ateliers for boys and\r\ngirls, and a penitentiary (\"Casa delle Donne cattive\"). A large church\r\nwas attached to the hospital by Leo XII. No old men are admitted who\r\nhave not inhabited Rome for five years; if they are still able to work a\r\nsmall daily task is given to them. The old women, as long as they can\r\nwork, are obliged to mend and wash the linen of the establishment. The\r\nboys, for the most part orphans, are received at the age of eleven. The\r\ngirls receive a dowry of 300 francs if they marry, but double that sum\r\nif they consent to enter a convent. A printing press is attached to the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nS. Michele occupies the site of the sacred grove of the goddess Furina\r\n(not of the Furies), where Caius Gracchus was killed, B.C. 123.\r\nProtected by his friends, he escaped from the Aventine, where he had\r\nfirst taken refuge, and crossed the Pons Sublicius. A single slave\r\nreached the grove of Furina with him, who having in vain sought for a\r\nhorse to continue their flight, first slew his master and then himself.\r\nOne Septimuleius then cut off the head of Gracchus, and--a proclamation\r\nhaving been issued that any one who brought the head of Caius Gracchus\r\nshould receive its weight in gold--first filled it with lead, and then\r\ncarried it on a spear to the consul Opimius, who paid him his\r\nblood-money.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this street is the _Porta Portese_, built by Urban VIII.,\r\nthrough which runs the road to Porto and Fiumicino.\r\n\r\nOutside this gate was the site of the camp of Tarquin,--afterwards given\r\nby the senate to Mutius-Scævola, for his bravery in the camp of Lars\r\nPorsenna. The vineyards here have an interest to Roman Catholics as the\r\nscene of one of the miracles attributed to Sta. Francesca Romana.\r\n\r\n     \"One fine sunny January day, Francesca and her companions had\r\n     worked since dawn in the vineyards of the Porta Portese. They had\r\n     worked hard for several hours, and then suddenly remembered that\r\n     they had brought no provisions with them. They soon became faint\r\n     and hungry, and, above all, very thirsty. Perna, the youngest of\r\n     all the oblates, was particularly heated and tired, and asked\r\n     permission of the Mother Superior to go to drink water at a\r\n     fountain some way off on the public road.\r\n\r\n     \"'Be patient, my child,' Francesca answered, and they went on with\r\n     their work; but Francesca withdrawing aside, knelt down, and said,\r\n     'Lord Jesus, I have been thoughtless in forgetting to provide food\r\n     for my sisters,--help us in our need.'\r\n\r\n     \"Perna, who had kept near the Mother Superior, said to herself,\r\n     with some impatience, 'It would be more to the purpose to take us\r\n     home at once.' Then Francesca, turning to her, said, 'My child, you\r\n     do not trust in God; look up and see.' And Perna saw a vine\r\n     entwined around a tree, whose dead and leafless branches were\r\n     loaded with grapes. In speechless astonishment the oblates\r\n     assembled around the tree, for they had all seen its bare and\r\n     withered branches. Twenty times at least they had passed before it,\r\n     and the season for grapes was gone by. There were exactly as many\r\n     bunches as persons present.'--_See Lady G. Fullerton's Life of Sta.\r\n     F. Romana._\r\n\r\nFrom the back of S. Michele a cross street leads to the _Church of Sta.\r\nMaria dell' Orto_, designed by Giulio Romano, _c._ 1530, except the\r\nfaçade, which is by Martino Lunghi. The high altar is by Giacomo della\r\nPorta. The church contains an Annunciation by _Taddeo Zucchero_.\r\n\r\n     \"Cette église appartient à plusieurs corporations; chacune a sa\r\n     tombe devant sa propre chapelle, et sur le couvercle sont gravées\r\n     ses armes particulières; un coq sur la tombe des marchands de\r\n     volaille, une pantoufle sur celle des savetiers, des artichauts sur\r\n     celle des jardiniers, &c.\"--_Robello._\r\n\r\nClose to this, at the end of the street which runs parallel with S.\r\nMichele, is the _Church of S. Francesco a Ripa_, the noviciate of the\r\nFranciscans--\"Frati Minori.\" The convent contains the room (approached\r\nthrough the church) in which St. Francis lived, during his visits at\r\nRome, with many relics of him. His stone pillow and his crucifix are\r\nshown, and a picture of him by G. de' Lettesoli. An altar in his chamber\r\nsupports a reliquary in which 18,000 relics are displayed!\r\n\r\nThe church was rebuilt soon after the death of St. Francis by the knight\r\nPandolfo d'Anquillara (his castle is in the Via Lungaretta), whose tomb\r\nis in the church, with his figure, in the dress of a Franciscan monk,\r\nwhich he assumed in the latter part of his life. It was again rebuilt by\r\nCardinal Pallavicini, from designs of Matteo Rossi. Among its pictures\r\nare the Virgin and St. Anne by _Baciccio_, the Nativity by _Simon\r\nVouet_, and a dead Christ by _Annibale Caracci_. On the left of the\r\naltar is the Altieri chapel, in which is a recumbent statue of the\r\nblessed Luigi Albertoni, by _Bernini_. In the third chapel on the right\r\nis a mummy, said to be that of the virgin martyr Sta. Semplicia. The\r\nconvent garden has some beautiful palm-trees.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Via Morticelli we regain the Via Lungaretta near S.\r\nBenedetto. This street, more than any other in Rome, retains remnants of\r\nmediæval architecture. On the right (opposite the opening to the west\r\nend of S. Chrisogono) is the entrance to the old _Castle of the\r\nAnguillara Family_, of whom were Count Pandolfo d'Anguillara already\r\nmentioned, and Everso, his grandson, celebrated for his highway\r\nrobberies between Rome and Viterbo in the fifteenth century; also Orso\r\nd'Anguillara, senator of Rome, who crowned Petrarch at the Capitol on\r\nEaster Day, 1341. \"The family device, two crossed eels, surmounted by a\r\nhelmet, and a wild boar holding a serpent in his mouth, is believed to\r\nrefer to the story of the founder of their house, Malagrotta, a second\r\nSt. George, who slew a terrible serpent, which had devastated the\r\ndistrict round his abode, and received in recompense from the pope the\r\ngift of as much land as he could walk round in one day.\"[361]\r\n\r\nThe existing remains consist of an arch, called \"L'Arco dell'\r\nAnnunziata,\" and a brick tower, which is now in the possession of a\r\nSignor Forti, who exhibits here, during Epiphany, a remarkably pretty\r\n_Presepio_, in which the Holy Family and the Shepherds are seen backed\r\nby the real landscape. For those who witness this sight it will be\r\ninteresting to turn to the origin of a Presepio.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Francis asked [of Pope Honorius III. 1223], with his usual\r\n     simplicity, to be allowed to celebrate Christmas with certain\r\n     unusual ceremonies which had suggested themselves to\r\n     him--ceremonies which he must have thought likely to seize upon the\r\n     popular imagination and impress the unlearned folk. He would not do\r\n     it on his own authority, we are told, lest he should be accused of\r\n     levity. When he made this petition, he was bound for the village of\r\n     Grecia, a little place not far from Assisi, where he was to remain\r\n     during that sacred season. In this village, when the eve of the\r\n     nativity approached, Francis instructed a certain grave and worthy\r\n     man, called Giovanni, to prepare an ox and an ass, along with a\r\n     manger and all the common fittings of a stable, for his use, in the\r\n     church. When the solemn night arrived, Francis and his brethren\r\n     arranged all these things into a visible representation of the\r\n     occurrences of the night at Bethlehem. The manger was filled with\r\n     hay, the animals were led into their places; the scene was\r\n     prepared as we see it now through all the churches of Southern\r\n     Italy--a reproduction, so far as the people know how, in startling\r\n     realistic detail of the surroundings of the first Christmas.... We\r\n     are told that Francis stood by this, his simple theatrical (for\r\n     such, indeed, it was--no shame to him) representation, all the\r\n     night long, sighing for joy, and filled with an unspeakable\r\n     sweetness.\"--_Mrs. Oliphant, St. Francis._\r\n\r\nOn the left, is the fine _Church of S. Chrisogono_, founded by Pope\r\nSylvester, but rebuilt in 731, and again by Cardinal Scipio Borghese\r\n(who modernized so many of the old churches), in 1623. The tower is\r\nmediæval (rebuilt?), but spoilt by whitewash; the portico has four\r\nancient granite columns. The interior is a basilica, the nave being\r\nseparated from the aisles by twenty-two granite columns, and the tribune\r\nfrom the nave by two magnificent columns of porphyry. The baldacchino,\r\nof graceful proportions, rests on pillars of yellow alabaster. Over the\r\ntabernacle is a picture of the Virgin and Child by the _Cav. d'Arpino_.\r\nThe mosaic in the tribune, probably only the fragment of a larger\r\ndesign, represents the Madonna and Child enthroned, between St. James\r\nthe Great and St. Chrisogonus. The stalls are good specimens of modern\r\nwood-carving. Near the end of the right aisle is the modern tomb of Anna\r\nMaria Taigi, lately beatified and likely to be canonized, though readers\r\nof her life will find it difficult to imagine why,--the great point of\r\nher character being that she was a good wife to her husband, though he\r\nwas \"ruvido di maniere, e grossolano.\" Stephen Langton, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, was titular cardinal of this church.\r\n\r\nS. Chrisogono, represented in the mosaic as a young knight, stood by\r\nSta. Anastasia during her martyrdom, exhorting her to patient endurance.\r\nHe was afterwards himself beheaded under Diocletian, and his body\r\nthrown into the sea.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 an _Excubitorium_ of the VIIth cohort of Vigiles (a station of\r\nRoman firemen) was discovered near this church. Several chambers were\r\ntolerably perfect.\r\n\r\nOn the left, we pass the _Hospital of S. Gallicano_, founded by Benedict\r\nXIII. (Orsini), in 1725, as is told by the inscription over the\r\nentrance, for the \"neglectis rejectisque ab omnibus.\" The interior\r\ncontains two long halls opening into one another, the first containing\r\n120 beds for men, the second 88 for women. Patients affected with\r\nmaladies of the skin are received here to the number of 100. The\r\nprincipal treatment is by means of baths, which gives the negative,\r\nwithin these walls, to the Italian saying that \"an ancient Roman took as\r\nmany baths in a week as a modern Roman in all his life.\" The\r\nestablishment is at present under the management of the Benfratelli\r\n(\"Fate bene fratelli\"). S. Gallicano, to whom the hospital is dedicated,\r\nwas a Benfratello of the time of Constantine, who devoted his time and\r\nhis fortune to the poor.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end of the Via Lungaretta is a piazza with a very handsome\r\nfountain, on one side of which is the _Church of Sta. Maria in\r\nTrastevere_, supposed to be the first church in Rome dedicated to the\r\nVirgin. It was founded by St. Calixtus in _A.D._ 224, on the site of the\r\nTaberna-Meritoria, an asylum for old soldiers; where, according to Don\r\nCassius, a fountain of pure oil sprang up at the time of our Saviour's\r\nbirth, and flowed away in one day to the Tiber, a story which gave the\r\nname of \"Fons Olei\" to the church in early times. It is said that\r\nwine-sellers and tavern-keepers (popinarii) disputed with the early\r\nChristian inhabitants for this site, upon which the latter had raised\r\nsome kind of humble oratory, and that they carried their complaint\r\nbefore Alexander Severus, when the emperor awarded the site to the\r\nChristians, saying, \"I prefer that it should belong to those who honour\r\nGod, whatever be their form of worship.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Ce souvenir augmente encore l'intérêt qui s'attache à l'église de\r\n     Santa Maria in Trastevere. Les colonnes antiques de granit égyptien\r\n     de cette basilique et les belles mosaïques qui la décorent me\r\n     touchent moins que la tradition d'après laquelle elle fut élevée là\r\n     où de pauvres chrétiens se rassemblaient dans un cabaret purifié\r\n     par leur piété, pour y célébrer le culte qui devait un jour étaler\r\n     ses magnificences sous le dôme resplendissant de\r\n     Saint-Pierre.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 318.\r\n\r\nThe church was rebuilt in 340 by Julius I., and after a series of\r\nalterations was again almost entirely reconstructed in 1139 by Innocent\r\nII., as a thanksgiving offering for the submission of the anti-pope.\r\nEugenius III. (1145--50) finished what was left uncompleted, but the new\r\nbasilica was not consecrated till the time of Innocent III.\r\n(1198--1216). The tower, apse, tribune, and mosaics belong to the early\r\nrestoration; the rest is due to alterations made by Bernardino\r\nRossellini for Nicholas V.\r\n\r\nThe west façade is covered with mosaics; the upper part--representing\r\nthe Saviour throned between angels--and the lower--of palms, the twelve\r\nsheep, and the mystic cities--are additions by Pius IX. in 1869. The\r\ncentral frieze was begun in the twelfth century under Eugenius III., and\r\ncompleted in the fourteenth by Pietro Cavallini. It represents the\r\nVirgin and Child enthroned in the midst, and ten female figures,\r\ngenerally described as the Ten Virgins,--but Hemans remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"It is evident that such subject cannot have been in the artist's\r\n     thoughts, as each stately figure advances towards the throne with\r\n     the same devout aspect and graceful serenity, the same faith and\r\n     confidence; the sole observable distinctions being that the two\r\n     with unlit lamps are somewhat more matronly, their costumes\r\n     simpler, than is the case with the rest; and that instead of being\r\n     crowned, as are the others, these two wear veils. Explanation of\r\n     such attributes may be found in the mystic meaning--the light being\r\n     appropriate to virgin saints, the oil taken to signify benevolence\r\n     or almsgiving; and we may conclude that those without light\r\n     represent wives or widows, the others virgin saints, in this group.\r\n     Two other diminutive figures (the scale indicating humility), who\r\n     kneel at the feet of Mary, are Innocent II. and Eugenius III., both\r\n     vested in the pontifical mantle, but bareheaded. Originally the\r\n     Mother and Child _alone_ had the nimbus around the head, as we see\r\n     in a water-colour drawing from this original (now in the Barberini\r\n     Library) dated 1640, made _before_ a renovation by which that halo\r\n     has been given alike to all the female figures. Another much faded\r\n     mosaic, the Madonna and Child, under an arched canopy, high up on\r\n     the campanile, may perhaps be as ancient as those on the\r\n     façade.\"--_Mediæval Christian Art._\r\n\r\nThe portico contains two frescoes of the Annunciation, one of them\r\nascribed to _Cavallini_. Its walls are occupied by early Christian and\r\npagan inscriptions. One, of the time of Trajan, is regarded with\r\npeculiar interest: \"MARCUS COCCEUS LIB. AUG. AMBROSIUS PRÆPOSITUS,\r\nVESTIS ALBÆ, TRIUMPHALIS, FECIT, NICE CONJUGI SUÆ CUM QUA VIXIT ANNOS\r\nXXXXV., DIEBUS XI., SINE ULLA QUERELA.\" Between the doors is preserved a\r\ncurious relic--the stone said to have been attached to St. Calixtus when\r\nhe was thrown into the well. The interior is that of a basilica. The\r\nnave, paved with opus-alexandrinum, is divided from the aisles by\r\ntwenty-two ancient granite columns, whose Ionic capitals are in several\r\ninstances decorated with heads of pagan gods. They support a\r\nrichly-decorated architrave. The roof, in the centre of which is a\r\npicture of the Assumption of the Virgin, is painted by _Domenichino_. On\r\nthe right of the entrance is a ciborium by Mino da Fiesole. The high\r\naltar covers a confessional, beneath which are the remains of five\r\nearly popes, removed from the catacombs. Among the tombs are those of\r\nthe painters, Lanfranco and Ciro Ferri, and of Bastari, librarian of the\r\nVatican, editor of the dictionary of the Della Cruscan Academy, and\r\ncanon of this church, ob. 1775.\r\n\r\nPope Innocent II. is buried here without a tomb.\r\n\r\nIn the left transept is a beautiful gothic tabernacle over an altar,\r\nerected by Cardinal d'Alençon, nephew of Charles de Valois, and brother\r\nof Philippe le Bel. On one side is the tomb of that cardinal (the fresco\r\nrepresents the martyrdom of his patron St. Philip, who is pourtrayed as\r\ncrucified with his head downwards like St. Peter); on the other is the\r\nmonument of Cardinal Stefaneschi, by _Paolo_, one of the first sculptors\r\nof the fourteenth century. Opening from hence is a chapel, which has a\r\ncurious picture of the Council of Trent by _Taddeo Zucchero_. At the end\r\nof the right aisle are several more fine tombs of the sixteenth century,\r\nand the chapel of the Madonna di Strada Cupa, designed by _Domenichino_,\r\nfrom whose hand is the figure of a child scattering flowers, sketched\r\nout in one corner of the vaulting.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the tribune is adorned with magnificent mosaics,\r\n(restored in modern times by Camuccini,) of the time of Innocent II.\r\n\r\n     \"In the centre of the principal group on the vault is the Saviour,\r\n     seated, with his Mother, crowned and robed like an Eastern Queen,\r\n     beside him, both sharing the same gorgeous throne and footstool;\r\n     while a hand extends from a fan-like glory with a jewelled crown\r\n     held over his head; _she_ (a singular detail here) giving\r\n     benediction with the usual action; He embracing her with the left\r\n     arm, and in the right hand holding a tablet that displays the words\r\n     'Veni, electa mea, et ponam in thronum meum;' to which corresponds\r\n     the text, from the song of Solomon, on a tablet in her left hand,\r\n     'Læva ejus sub capite meo et dextera illius amplexabitur me.' Below\r\n     the heavenly throne stand, each with name inscribed in gold\r\n     letters, Innocent II., holding a model of this church; St.\r\n     Laurence, in deacon's vestments, with the Gospels and the jewelled\r\n     cross; the sainted popes, Calixtus I., Cornelius, and Julius I.;\r\n     St. Peter (in classic white vestments), and Calepodius, a martyr of\r\n     the third century, here introduced because his body, together with\r\n     those of the other saints in the same group, was brought from the\r\n     catacombs to this church.\r\n\r\n     \"As to ecclesiastical costume, this work affords decisive evidence\r\n     of its ancient splendour and varieties. We do not see the keys in\r\n     the hands of St. Peter, but the large tonsure on his head; that\r\n     ecclesiastical badge which he is said to have invented, and which\r\n     is sometimes the sole peculiarity (besides the ever-recognisable\r\n     type) given to this Apostle in art.\r\n\r\n     \"Above the archivolt we see a cross between the Alpha and Omega,\r\n     and the winged emblems of the Evangelists; laterally, Jeremiah and\r\n     Isaiah, each with a prophetic text on a scroll; along a frieze\r\n     below, twelve sheep advancing from the holy cities, Jerusalem and\r\n     Bethlehem, towards the Divine Lamb, who stands on a mount whence\r\n     issue the four rivers of Paradise--or, according to perhaps juster\r\n     interpretation, the four streams of gospel truth. Palms and a\r\n     phœnix are seen beside the two prophets; also a less common\r\n     symbol--caged birds, that signify the righteous soul incarcerated\r\n     in the body, or (with highest reference) the Saviour in his assumed\r\n     humanity; such accessory reminding of the ancient usage, in some\r\n     countries, of releasing birds at funerals, and of that still kept\r\n     up amidst the magnificent canonization-rites, of offering various\r\n     kinds of birds, in cages, at the papal throne.\r\n\r\n     \"Remembering the date of the composition before us, about a century\r\n     and a half before the time of Cimabue and Giotto, we may hail in\r\n     it, if not an actual Renaissance, the dawn, at least, that heralds\r\n     a brighter day for art, compared with the deep gloom\r\n     previous.\"--_Hemans' Mediæval Christian Art._\r\n\r\nBelow these are another series of mosaics representing six scenes in the\r\nlife of the Virgin, the work of Pietro Cavallini, of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, when they were ordered by Bertoldo Stefaneschi, who is himself\r\nintroduced in one of the subjects. In the centre of the tribune is an\r\nancient marble episcopal throne, raised by a flight of steps.\r\n\r\nIn the _Sacristy_ is a picture of the Virgin with S. Rocco and S.\r\nSebastiano, by _Perugino_. Here are preserved some beautiful fragments\r\nof mosaics of birds, &c., from the catacombs.\r\n\r\nOutside the right transept of Sta. Maria is a picturesque shrine, and\r\nthere are many points about this ancient church which are interesting to\r\nthe artist. The palace, which forms one side of the piazza at the west\r\nend of the church, formerly _Palazzo Moroni_, is now used as the summer\r\nresidence of the Benedictine monks of S. Paolo, who are driven from\r\ntheir convent by the malaria during the hot months. During the\r\nrevolutionary government of 1848--49, a number of priests suffered death\r\nhere, which has led to the monastery being regarded as \"the Carmes of\r\nRome.\" The modern _Church of S. Calisto_ contains the well in which he\r\nsuffered martyrdom, A.D. 222. This well, now seen through a door near\r\nthe altar, was then in the open air, and the pope was thrown into it\r\nfrom the window of a house in which he had been imprisoned and scourged,\r\nand where he had converted the soldier who was appointed to guard him.\r\nHis festival is celebrated here with great splendour by the monks.\r\n\r\nOpposite S. Calisto is the _Monastery of St. Anna_, in which were passed\r\nthe last days of the beautiful and learned Vittoria Colonna. As her\r\ndeath approached she was removed to the neighbouring house of her\r\nkinsman Giuliano Cesarini, and there she expired (February, 1547) in the\r\npresence of her devoted friend, Michael Angelo, who always regretted\r\nthat he had not in that solemn moment ventured to press his lips for the\r\nfirst and last time to her beautiful countenance. She was buried, by her\r\nown desire, in the convent chapel, without any monument.\r\n\r\nHence a lane leads to the _Church of S. Cosimato_, in an open space\r\nfacing the hill of S. Rietro in Montorio (where stands of seats are\r\nplaced during the Girandola). A courtyard is entered through a low arch\r\nsupported by two ancient columns, having a high roof with rich\r\nterra-cotta mouldings,--beautiful in colour. The court contains an\r\nantique fountain, and is exceedingly picturesque. The church has\r\ncarefully sculptured details of cornice and moulding; the door is a good\r\nspecimen of mediæval wood-carving. The wall on the left of the altar is\r\noccupied by a most beautiful fresco of _Pinturicchio_, representing St.\r\nFrancis and St. Clare standing on either side of the Virgin and Child.\r\nOpening from the end of the left aisle is a very interesting chapel,\r\ndecorated with frescoes, and containing a most beautiful altar of the\r\nfifteenth century, in honour of the saints Severa and Fortunata, with\r\nstatuettes of Faith, Justice, Charity, and Hope. Attached to the church\r\nis a very large convent of Poor Clares, which produced two saints,\r\nTheodora and Seraphina, in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Via della Scala, on the south side of Sta. Maria in\r\nTrastevere, we reach the _Porta Settimiana_, built by Alexander VI. on\r\nthe site of a gateway raised by Honorius, which marked the position of\r\nan arch of Septimius Severus. This is the entrance of the Via Lungara,\r\ncontaining the Corsini and Farnesina Palaces (see Chapter XX.). The\r\ngateway has forked battlements, but is much spoilt by recent\r\nplasterings. Near this is _Sta. Dorotea_, an ugly church, but important\r\nin church history from its connection with the foundation of the Order\r\nof the Theatins, which arose out of a revulsion from the sensuous age of\r\nLeo X.; and as containing the tomb of their founder, Don Gaëtano di\r\nTeatino, the friend of Paul IV.\r\n\r\n     \"Dès le règne de Léon X., quelques symptômes d'une réaction\r\n     religieuse se manifestèrent dans les hautes classes de la société\r\n     romaine. On vit un certain nombre d'hommes éminents s'affilier les\r\n     uns aux autres, afin de trouver dans de saintes pratiques assez de\r\n     force pour résister à l'atmosphère énervante qui les entourait. Ils\r\n     prirent pour leur association le titre et les emblèmes de l'amour\r\n     divin, et ils s'assemblèrent, à des jours déterminés, dans l'église\r\n     de Sainte-Dorothée, près de la porte Settimiana. Parmi ces hommes\r\n     de foi et d'avenir, on citait un archevêque, Caraffa; un\r\n     protonotaire apostolique, Gaëtan de Thiène; un noble Vénitien aussi\r\n     distingué par son caractére que par ses talents, Contarini; et\r\n     cinquante autres dont les noms rappellaient tons, ou une\r\n     illustration ou une haute position sociale, tels que Lippomano,\r\n     Sadolet, Ghiberti.\r\n\r\n     \"Mais bientôt ces premiers essais de rupture avec la tendance\r\n     générale des esprits enflammèrent le zèle de plusieurs des membres\r\n     de la Congrégation de _l'Amour divin_. Caraffa surtout, dont l'âme\r\n     ardente n'avait trouvé qu'anxiétés et fatigue dans les grandeurs,\r\n     aspirait à une vie d'action qui lui permit de s'employer, de tous\r\n     ses moyens, à la réforme du monde. Il trouva dans Gaëtan de Thiène\r\n     des dispositions conformes à ce qu'il désirait. Gaëtan avait\r\n     cependant un caractère très-différent du sien; doué d'une angélique\r\n     douceur, craignant de se faire entendre, recherchant la méditation\r\n     et la retraite, il eût voulu, lui aussi, réformer le monde, mais il\r\n     n'eût pas voulu en être connu. Les qualités diverses de ces deux\r\n     hommes rares se combinèrent heureusement dans l'exécution du projet\r\n     qu'ils avaient conçu, c'était de former des ecclésiastiques voués,\r\n     tout ensemble à la contemplation et à une vie austère, à la\r\n     prédication et au soin des malades; des ecclésiastiques qui\r\n     donnassent partout au clergé l'exemple de l'accomplissement des\r\n     devoirs de sa sainte mission.\"--_Gournerie, Rome Chrétienne_, ii.\r\n     157.\r\n\r\n     \"When Dorothea, the maiden of Cæsarea, was condemned to death by\r\n     Sapritius, she replied, 'Be it so, then I shall the sooner stand in\r\n     the presence of Christ, my spouse, in whose garden are the fruits\r\n     of paradise, and roses that never fade.' As she was being led to\r\n     execution, the young Theophilus mocking said, 'O maiden, goest thou\r\n     to join thy bridegroom? send me then, I pray thee, of the fruits\r\n     and flowers which grow in his garden.' And the maiden bowed her\r\n     head and smiled, saying, 'Thy request is granted, O Theophilus,'\r\n     whereat he laughed, and she went forward to death.\r\n\r\n     \"And behold, at the place of execution, a beautiful child, with\r\n     hair like the sunbeam, stood beside her, and in his hand was a\r\n     basket containing three fresh roses and three apples. And she said,\r\n     'Take these to Theophilus, and tell him that Dorothea waits for him\r\n     in the garden from whence they came.'\r\n\r\n     \"And the child sought Theophilus, and gave him the flowers and the\r\n     fruits, saying, 'Dorothea sends thee these,' and vanished. And the\r\n     heart of Theophilus melted, and he ate of the fruit from heaven,\r\n     and was converted and professed himself one of Christ's servants,\r\n     so that he also was martyred, and was translated into the heavenly\r\n     garden.\"--_Legend._\r\n\r\nThis story is told in nearly all the pictures of Sta. Dorotea.\r\n\r\nHence we reach the _Ponte Sisto_, built 1473--75 by Sixtus IV. in the\r\nplace of the Pons Janiculensis, (or, according to Ampère, the Pons\r\nAntoninus,) which Caracalla had erected to reach the garden in the\r\nTrastevere, formerly belonging to his brother Geta,--but which was known\r\nas the Pons Fractus after a flood had destroyed part of it in 792. The\r\nActs of Eusebius describe the many Christian martyrdoms which took place\r\nfrom this bridge. S. Symphorosa under Hadrian, S. Sabas under Aurelian,\r\nS. Calepodius under Alexander, and S. Anthimius under Diocletian, were\r\nthrown into the Tiber from hence, with many others, whose bodies,\r\nusually drifting to the island then called Lycaonia, were recovered\r\nthere by their faithful disciples.[362] An inscription upon the bridge\r\nbegs the prayers of the passengers for its papal founder.\r\n\r\nBeautiful views may be obtained from this bridge,--on the one side, of\r\nthe island, of the temple of Vesta, and the Alban hills; on the other,\r\nof St. Peter's, rising behind the Farnesina Gardens, and the grand mass\r\nof the Farnese Palace, towering above the less important buildings.\r\n\r\n     \"They had reached the bridge and stopped to look at the view,\r\n     perhaps the most beautiful of all those seen from the Roman\r\n     bridges. Looking towards the hills, the Tiber was spanned by Ponte\r\n     Rotto, under which the old black mills were turning ceaselessly,\r\n     almost level with the tawny water; the sunshine fell full on the\r\n     ruins of the Palatine, about the base of which had gathered a crowd\r\n     of modern buildings; a brick campanile, of the middle ages, rose\r\n     high above them against the blue sky, which was seen through its\r\n     open arches; beyond were the Latin Hills; on the other hand, St.\r\n     Peter's stood pre-eminent in the distance; nearer, a stack of\r\n     picturesque old houses were half hidden by orange-trees, where\r\n     golden fruit clustered thickly; women leant from the windows, long\r\n     lines of flapping clothes hung out to dry; below, the ferry-boat\r\n     was crossing the river, impelled by the current. Modern and ancient\r\n     Rome all mingled together--everywhere were thrilling names\r\n     connected with all that was most glorious in the past. The moderns\r\n     are richer than their ancestors, the past is theirs as well as the\r\n     present.\"--_Mademoiselle Mori._\r\n\r\nClose to the further entrance of the bridge, opposite the Via Giulia, is\r\nthe _Fountain of the Ponte Sisto_, built by Paul V. from a design of\r\nFontana. The water, which falls in one body from a niche in the wall of\r\na palace, is discharged a second time from the mouths of two monsters\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRE FONTANE AND S. PAOLO.\r\n\r\n     The Marmorata--Arco di S. Lazzaro--Protestant Cemetery--Pyramid of\r\n     Caius Cestius--Monte-Testaccio--Porta S. Paolo--Chapel of the\r\n     Farewell--The Tre Fontane (SS. Vincenzo ed Anastasio--Sta. Maria\r\n     Scala Cœli--S. Paolo alle Tre Fontane)--Basilica and Monastery\r\n     of S. Paolo.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the Piazza Bocca della Verità, the _Via della Marmorata_ is\r\nspanned by an arch which nearly marks the site of the _Porta Trigemina_,\r\nby which Marius fled to Ostia before Sylla in B.C. 88. Near this stood\r\nthe statue erected by public subscription to Minucius, whose jealousy\r\nbrought about the execution of the patriot Mælius, B.C. 440. Here also\r\nwas the temple of Jupiter Inventor, whose dedication was attributed to\r\nthe gratitude of Hercules for the restoration of his cattle, carried off\r\nby Cacus to his cave on the neighbouring Aventine.\r\n\r\nIt was at the Porta Trigemina that Camillus (B.C. 391), sent into exile\r\nto Ardea by the accusations of the plebs, stayed, and, stretching forth\r\nhis hands to the Capitol, prayed to the gods who reigned there that if\r\nhe was unjustly expelled, Rome might \"one day have need of Camillus.\"\r\n\r\nPassing the arch, the road skirts the wooded escarpment of the\r\nAventine, crowned by its three churches--Sta. Sabina, S. Alessio, and\r\nthe Priorato.\r\n\r\n     \"De ce côté, entre l'Aventin et le Tibre, hors de la porte\r\n     Trigemina, étaient divers marchés, notamment le marché aux bois, le\r\n     marché à la farine et au pain, les _horrea_, magasins de blés. Le\r\n     voisinage de ces marchés, de ces magasins et de l'emporium,\r\n     produisait un grand mouvement de transport et fournissait de\r\n     l'occupation à beaucoup de portefaix. Plaute[363] fait allusion à\r\n     ces porteurs de sacs de la porte Trigemina. On peut en voir encore\r\n     tous les jours remplir le même office au même lieu.\"--_Ampère,\r\n     Hist. Rom._ iv. 75.\r\n\r\nFrom the landing-place for modern Carrara marble, a new road on the\r\nright, planted with trees, leads along the river to the ancient\r\n_Marmorata_, discovered 1867--68, when many magnificent blocks of\r\nancient marble were found buried in the mud of the Tiber. Recent\r\nexcavations have laid bare the inclined planes by which the marbles were\r\nlanded, and the projecting bars of stone with rings for mooring the\r\nmarble vessels.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbouring vineyard are the massive ruins of the _Emporium_, or\r\nmagazine for merchandise, founded by M. Æmilius Lepidus and L. Æmilius\r\nPaulus, the ædiles in B.C. 186. Upon the ancient walls of this time is\r\nengrafted a small and picturesque winepress of the fifteenth century.\r\nThe neighbouring vineyard is much frequented by marble collectors.\r\n\r\nA short distance beyond the turn to the Marmorata the main road is\r\ncrossed by an ancient brick arch, called _Arco di S. Lazzaro_, or Arco\r\ndella Salara, by the side of which is a hermitage.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile beyond this we reach the _Porta S. Paolo_, built by\r\nBelisarius on the site of the Ancient Porta Ostiensis.\r\n\r\nIt was here, just within the Ostian Gate, that the Emperor Claudius,\r\nreturning from Ostia to take vengeance upon Messalina, was met by their\r\ntwo children, Octavia and Britannicus, accompanied by a vestal, who\r\ninsisted upon the rights of her Order, and imperiously demanded that the\r\nempress should not be condemned undefended.\r\n\r\n     \"Totila entra par la porte Asinaria et une autre fois par la porte\r\n     Ostiensis, aujourd'hui porte Saint-Paul; par la même porte,\r\n     Genséric, que la mer apportait, et qui, en s'embarquant, avait dit\r\n     à son pilote: 'Conduis-moi vers le rivage que menace la colère\r\n     divine.'\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 325.\r\n\r\nClose to this, is the famous _Pyramid of Caius Cestius_. It is built of\r\nbrick, coated with marble, and is 125 feet high, and 100 feet wide at\r\nits square basement. In the midst is a small sepulchral chamber, painted\r\nwith arabesques. Two inscriptions on the exterior show that the Caius\r\nCestius buried here was a prætor, a tribune of the people, and one of\r\nthe \"Epulones\" appointed to provide the sacrificial feasts of the gods.\r\nHe died about 30 B.C., leaving Agrippa as his executor, and desiring by\r\nhis will that his body might be buried, wrapped up in precious stuffs.\r\nAgrippa, however, applied to him the law which forbade luxurious burial,\r\nand spent the money, partly upon the pyramid and partly upon erecting\r\ntwo colossal statues in honour of the deceased, of which the pedestals\r\nhave been found near the tomb. In the middle ages this was supposed to\r\nbe the sepulchre of Remus.\r\n\r\n     \"Cette pyramide, sauf les dimensions, est absolument semblable aux\r\n     pyramides d'Égypte. Si l'on pouvait encore douter que celles-ci\r\n     étaient des tombeaux, l'imitation des pyramides égyptiennes dans un\r\n     tombeau romain serait un argument de plus pour prouver qu'elles\r\n     avaient une destination funéraire. La chambre qu'on a trouvée dans\r\n     le monument de Cestius était décorée de peintures dont quelques\r\n     unes ne sont pas encore effacées. C'était la coutume des peuples\r\n     anciens, notamment des Egyptiens et des Etrusques, de peindre\r\n     l'intérieur des tombeaux, que l'on fermait ensuite soigneusement.\r\n     Ces peintures, souvent très-considérables, n'étaient que pour le\r\n     mort, et ne devaient jamais être vues par l'œil d'un vivant. Il\r\n     en était certainement ainsi de celles qui décoraient la chambre\r\n     sépulchrale de la pyramide de Cestius, car cette chambre n'avait\r\n     aucune entrée. L'ouverture par laquelle on y pénètre aujourd'hui\r\n     est moderne. On avait déposé le corps ou les cendres avant de\r\n     terminer le monument, on acheva ensuite de la bâtir jusqu'au\r\n     sommet.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ i. 347.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Paul was led to execution beyond the city walls, upon the road\r\n     to Ostia. As he issued forth from the gate, his eyes must have\r\n     rested for a moment on that sepulchral pyramid which stood beside\r\n     the road, and still stands unshattered, amid the wreck of so many\r\n     centuries, upon the same spot. That spot was then only the\r\n     burial-place of a single Roman; it is now the burial-place of many\r\n     Britons. The mausoleum of Caius Cestius rises conspicuously amongst\r\n     humbler graves, and marks the site where Papal Rome suffers her\r\n     Protestant sojourners to bury their dead. In England and in\r\n     Germany, in Scandinavia and in America, there are hearts which turn\r\n     to that lofty cenotaph as the sacred point of their whole horizon;\r\n     even as the English villager turns to the grey church tower, which\r\n     overlooks the grave-stones of his kindred. Among the works of man,\r\n     that pyramid is the only surviving witness of the martyrdom of St.\r\n     Paul; and we may thus regard it with yet deeper interest, as a\r\n     monument unconsciously erected by a pagan to the memory of a\r\n     martyr. Nor let us think they who lie beneath its shadow are indeed\r\n     resting (as degenerate Italians fancy) in unconsecrated ground.\r\n     Rather let us say, that a spot where the disciples of Paul's faith\r\n     now sleep in Christ, so near the soil once watered by his blood, is\r\n     doubly hallowed; and that their resting-place is most fitly\r\n     identified with the last earthly journey, and the dying glance of\r\n     their own patron saint, the apostle of the Gentiles.\"--_Conybeare\r\n     and Howson._\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Pyramid is the _Old Protestant Cemetery_, a lovely\r\nspot, now closed. Here is the grave of Keats, with the inscription:\r\n\r\n     \"This grave contains all that was mortal of a young English poet,\r\n     who, on his death-bed, in the bitterness of his heart at the\r\n     malicious power of his enemies, desired these words to be engraven\r\n     on his tombstone: 'Here lies one whose name was writ in water.'\r\n     February 24, 1821.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Go thou to Rome--at once the paradise,\r\n    The grave, the city, and the wilderness;\r\n    And where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,\r\n    And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress\r\n    The bones of desolation's nakedness,\r\n    Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead\r\n    Thy footsteps to a slope of green access,\r\n    Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead,\r\n    A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread,\r\n\r\n    \"And grey walls moulder round, on which dull Time\r\n    Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;\r\n    And one keen pyramid, with wedge sublime,\r\n    Pavilioning the dust of him who planned\r\n    This refuge for his memory, doth stand\r\n    Like flame transformed to marble; and beneath\r\n    A field is spread, on which a newer band\r\n    Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death,\r\n    Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.\"\r\n\r\n    _Shelley's Adonais._\r\n\r\nVery near the grave of Keats is that of Augustus William Hare, the elder\r\nof the two brothers who wrote the \"Guesses at Truth,\" ob. 1834.\r\n\r\n     \"When I am inclined to be serious, I love to wander up and down\r\n     before the tomb of Caius Cestius. The Protestant burial-ground is\r\n     there, and most of the little monuments are erected to the\r\n     young--young men of promise, cut off when on their travels full of\r\n     enthusiasm, full of enjoyment; brides, in the bloom of their\r\n     beauty, on their first journey; or children borne from home in\r\n     search of health. This stone was placed by his fellow-travellers,\r\n     young as himself, who will return to the house of his parents\r\n     without him; that, by a husband or a father, now in his native\r\n     country. His heart is buried in that grave.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a quiet and sheltered nook, covered in the winter with\r\n     violets; and the pyramid, that overshadows it, gives it a classic\r\n     and singularly solemn air. You feel an interest there, a sympathy\r\n     you were not prepared for. You are yourself in a foreign land; and\r\n     they are for the most part your countrymen. They call upon you in\r\n     your mother tongue--in English--in words unknown to a native, known\r\n     only to yourself: and the tomb of Cestius, that old majestic pile,\r\n     has this also in common with them. It is itself a stranger among\r\n     strangers. It has stood there till the language spoken round about\r\n     it has changed; and the shepherd, born at the foot, can read the\r\n     inscription no longer.\"--_Rogers._\r\n\r\nThe _New Burial Ground_ was opened in 1825. It extends for some distance\r\nalong the slope of the hill under the old Aurelian Wall, and is\r\nbeautifully shaded by cypresses, and carpeted with violets. Amid the\r\nforest of tombs we may notice that which contains the heart of Shelley\r\n(his body having been burnt upon the shore at Lerici, where it was\r\nthrown up by the sea), inscribed:\r\n\r\n     \"Percy Bysshe Shelley, Cor Cordium. Natus IV. Aug. MDCCXCII. Obiit\r\n     VIII. Jul. MDCCCXXII.\r\n\r\n    'Nothing of him that doth fade,\r\n    But doth suffer a sea change\r\n    Into something rich and strange.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother noticeable tomb is that of Gibson the sculptor, who died 1868.\r\n\r\nFrom the fields in front of the cemetery (_Prati del Popolo Romano_)\r\nrises the _Monte Testaccio_, only 160 feet in height, but worth\r\nascending for the sake of the splendid view it affords. The\r\nextraordinary formation of this hill, which is entirely composed of\r\nbroken pieces of pottery, has long been an unexplained bewilderment.\r\n\r\n     \"Le Monte-Testaccio est pour moi des nombreux problèmes qu'offrent\r\n     les antiquités romaines le plus difficile à résoudre. On ne peut\r\n     s'arrêter à discuter sérieusement la tradition d'après laquelle il\r\n     aurait été formé avec les débris des vases contenant les tributs\r\n     qu'apportaient à Rome les peuples soumis par elle. C'est là\r\n     évidemment une légende du moyen âge née du souvenir de la grandeur\r\n     romaine et imaginée pour exprimer la haute idée qu'on s'en\r\n     faisait, comme on avait imaginé ces statues de provinces placées au\r\n     Capitole, et dont chacune portait au cou une cloche qui sonnait\r\n     tout-à-coup d'elle-même, quand une province se soulevait, comme on\r\n     a prétendu que le lit du Tibre était pavé en airain par les tributs\r\n     apportés aux empereurs romains. Il faut donc chercher une autre\r\n     explication.\"--_Ampère, Emp._ ii. 386.\r\n\r\nJust outside the Porta S. Paolo is (on the right) a vineyard which\r\nbelonged to Sta. Francesca Romana (born 1384, canonized 1608 by Paul\r\nV.).\r\n\r\n     \"Instead of entering into the pleasures to which her birth and\r\n     riches entitled her, Sta. Francesca went every day, disguised in a\r\n     coarse woollen garment, to her vineyard, and collected faggots,\r\n     which she brought into the city on her head, and distributed to the\r\n     poor. If the weight exceeded her womanly strength, she loaded\r\n     therewith an ass, following after on foot in great\r\n     humility.\"--_Mrs. Jameson's Monastic Orders._\r\n\r\nA straight road a mile and a half long leads from the gate to the\r\nbasilica. Half way (on the left) is the humble chapel which commemorates\r\nthe farewell of St. Peter and St. Paul on their way to martyrdom,\r\ninscribed:\r\n\r\n     \"In this place SS. Peter and Paul separated on their way to\r\n     martyrdom.\r\n\r\n     \"And Paul said to Peter, 'Peace be with thee, Foundation of the\r\n     Church, Shepherd of the flock of Christ.'\r\n\r\n     \"And Peter said to Paul, 'Go in peace, Preacher of good tidings,\r\n     and Guide of the salvation of the just.'\"[364]\r\n\r\nPassing the basilica, which looks outside like a very ugly railway\r\nstation, let us visit the scene of the martyrdom, before entering the\r\ngrand church which arose in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe road we now traverse is the scene of the legend of Plautilla.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Paul was beheaded by the sword outside the Ostian gate, about\r\n     two miles from Rome, at a place called the Aqua Salvias, now the\r\n     'Tre Fontane.' The legend of his death relates that a certain Roman\r\n     matron named Plautilla, one of the converts of St. Peter, placed\r\n     herself on the road by which St. Paul passed to his martyrdom, to\r\n     behold him for the last time; and when she saw him she wept\r\n     greatly, and besought his blessing. The apostle then, seeing her\r\n     faith, turned to her, and begged that she would give him her veil\r\n     to blind his eyes when he should be beheaded, promising to return\r\n     it to her after his death. The attendants mocked at such a promise,\r\n     but Plautilla, with a woman's faith and charity, taking off her\r\n     veil, presented it to him. After his martyrdom, St. Paul appeared\r\n     to her, and restored the veil stained with his blood.\r\n\r\n     \"In the ancient representations of the martyrdom of St. Paul, the\r\n     legend of Plautilla is seldom omitted. In the picture by Giotto in\r\n     the sacristy of St. Peter's, Plautilla is seen on an eminence in\r\n     the background, receiving the veil from the hands of St. Paul, who\r\n     appears in the clouds above; the same representation, but little\r\n     varied, is executed in bas-relief on the bronze doors of St.\r\n     Peter's.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\nThe lane which leads to the Tre Fontane turns off to the left a little\r\nbeyond S. Paolo.\r\n\r\n     \"In all the melancholy vicinity of Rome, there is not a more\r\n     melancholy spot than the Tre Fontane. A splendid monastery, rich\r\n     with all the offerings of Christendom, once existed there: the\r\n     ravages of that mysterious scourge of the Campagna, the malaria,\r\n     have rendered it a desert; three ancient churches and some ruins\r\n     still exist, and a few pale monks wander about the swampy dismal\r\n     confines of the hollow in which they stand. In winter you approach\r\n     them through a quagmire; in summer, you dare not breathe in their\r\n     pestilential vicinity; and yet there is a sort of dead beauty about\r\n     the place, something hallowed as well as sad, which seizes on the\r\n     fancy.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\nThe convent was bestowed in 1867 by Pius IX. upon the French Trappists,\r\nand twelve brethren of the Order went to reside there. Entering the\r\nlittle enclosure, the first church on the right is _Sta. Maria Scala\r\nCœli_, supposed to occupy the site of the cemetery of S. Zeno, in\r\nwhich the 12,000 Christians employed in building the Baths of Diocletian\r\nwere buried. The present edifice was the work of Vignola and Giacomo\r\ndella Porta in 1582. The name is derived from the legend that here St.\r\nBernard had a vision of a ladder which led to heaven, its foot resting\r\non this church, and of angels on the ladder leading upwards the souls\r\nwhom his prayers had redeemed from purgatory. The mosaics in the apse\r\nwere the work of _F. Zucchero_, in the sixteenth century, and are\r\nperhaps the best of modern mosaics. They represent the saints Zeno,\r\nBernard, Vincenzo, and Anastasio, adored by Pope Clement VIII. and\r\nCardinal Aldobrandini, under whom the remodelling of the church took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe second church is the basilica of _SS. Vincenzo ed Anastasio_,\r\nfounded by Honorius I. (625), and restored by Honorius III. (1221), when\r\nit was consecrated afresh. It is approached by an atrium with a\r\npenthouse roof, supported by low columns, and adorned with decaying\r\nfrescoes, among which the figure of Honorius III. may be made out. The\r\ninterior, which reeks with damp, is almost entirely of the twelfth\r\ncentury. The pillars are adorned with coarse frescoes of the apostles.\r\n\r\n     \"S. Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane so far deviates from the usual\r\n     basilican arrangement as almost to deserve the appellation of\r\n     gothic. It has the same defect as all the rest--its pier arches\r\n     being too low, for which there is no excuse here; but both\r\n     internally and externally it shows a uniformity of design, and a\r\n     desire to make every part ornamental, that produces a very pleasing\r\n     effect, although the whole is merely of brick, and ornament is so\r\n     sparingly applied as only just to prevent the building sinking to\r\n     the class of mere utilitarian erections.\"--_Fergusson's Handbook of\r\n     Architecture,_ vol. ii.\r\n\r\n     The two saints whose relics are said to repose here were in no wise\r\n     connected in their lifetime. S. Vincenzo, who suffered A.D. 304,\r\n     was a native of Saragossa, cruelly tortured to death at Valencia,\r\n     under Dacian, by being racked on a slow fire over a gridiron, \"of\r\n     which the bars were framed like scythes.\" His story is told with\r\n     horrible detail by Prudentius. Anastasius, who died A.D. 628, was a\r\n     native of Persia, who had become a Christian and taken the monastic\r\n     habit at a convent near Jerusalem. He was tortured and finally\r\n     strangled, under Chosroes, at Barsaloe, in Assyria. He is not known\r\n     to be represented anywhere in art, save in the almost obliterated\r\n     frescoes in the atrium of this church.\r\n\r\nThe third church, _S. Paolo alle Tre Fontane_, was built by Giacomo\r\ndella Porta for Cardinal Aldobrandini in 1590. It contains the pillars\r\nto which St. Paul is said to have been bound, the block of marble upon\r\nwhich he is supposed to have been beheaded, and the three fountains\r\nwhich sprang forth, wherever the severed head struck the earth during\r\nthree bounds which it made after decapitation. In proof of this story,\r\nit is asserted that the water of the first of these fountains is still\r\nwarm, of the second tepid, of the third cold. Three modern altars above\r\nthe fountains are each decorated with a head of the apostle in\r\nbas-relief.\r\n\r\n     \"A la première, l'âme vient à l'instant même de s'échapper du\r\n     corps. Ce chef glorieux est plein de vie! A la seconde, les ombres\r\n     de la mort couvrent déjà ses admirables traits; à la troisième, le\r\n     sommeil éternel les a envahis, et, quoique demeurés tout rayonnants\r\n     de beauté, ils disent, sans parler, que dans ce monde ces lèvres ne\r\n     s'entr'ouvriront plus, et que ce regard d'aigle s'est voilé pour\r\n     toujours.\"--_Une Chrétienne à Rome._[365]\r\n\r\nThe pavement is an ancient mosaic representing the Four Seasons, brought\r\nfrom the excavations at Ostia. The interior of this church has been\r\nbeautified at the expense of a French nobleman, and the whole enclosure\r\nof the Tre Fontane has been improved by Mgr. de Merode.\r\n\r\n     \"As the martyr and his executioners passed on (from the Ostian\r\n     gate), their way was crowded with a motley multitude of goers and\r\n     comers between the metropolis and its harbour--merchants hastening\r\n     to superintend the unlading of their cargoes--sailors eager to\r\n     squander the profits of their last voyage in the dissipations of\r\n     the capital--officials of the government charged with the\r\n     administration of the provinces, or the command of the legions on\r\n     the Euphrates or the Rhine--Chaldean astrologers--Phrygian\r\n     eunuchs--dancing-girls from Syria, with their painted\r\n     turbans--mendicant priests from Egypt, howling for Osiris--Greek\r\n     adventurers, eager to coin their national cunning into Roman\r\n     gold--representatives of the avarice and ambition, the fraud and\r\n     lust, the superstition and intelligence, of the Imperial world.\r\n     Through the dust and tumult of that busy throng, the small troop of\r\n     soldiers threaded their way silently, under the bright sky of an\r\n     Italian midsummer. They were marching, though they knew it not, in\r\n     a procession more really triumphal than any they had ever followed,\r\n     in the train of general or emperor, along the Sacred Way. Their\r\n     prisoner, now at last and for ever delivered from captivity,\r\n     rejoiced to follow his Lord 'without the gate.' The place of\r\n     execution was not far distant, and there the sword of the headsman\r\n     ended his long course of sufferings, and released that heroic soul\r\n     from that feeble body. Weeping friends took up his corpse, and\r\n     carried it for burial to those subterranean labyrinths, where,\r\n     through many ages of oppression, the persecuted Church found refuge\r\n     for the living, and sepulchres for the dead.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus died the apostle, the prophet, and the martyr, bequeathing to\r\n     the Church, in her government, and her discipline, the legacy of\r\n     his apostolic labours; leaving his prophetic words to be her living\r\n     oracles; pouring forth his blood to be the seed of a thousand\r\n     martyrdoms. Thenceforth, among the glorious company of the\r\n     apostles, among the goodly fellowship of the prophets, among the\r\n     noble army of martyrs, his name has stood pre-eminent. And\r\n     wheresoever the holy Church throughout all the world doth\r\n     acknowledge God, there Paul of Tarsus is revered, as the great\r\n     teacher of a universal redemption and a catholic religion--the\r\n     herald of glad tidings to all mankind.\"--_Conybeare and Howson_.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the grand Basilica which arose to commemorate the\r\nmartyrdom on this desolate site, and which is now itself standing alone\r\non the edge of the Campagna, entirely deserted except by a few monks\r\nwho linger in its monastery through the winter months, but take flight\r\nto St. Calisto before the pestilential malaria of the summer,--though in\r\nthe middle ages it was not so, when S. Paolo was surrounded by the\r\nflourishing fortified suburb of Joanopolis (so called from its founder,\r\nJohn VIII.), whose possession was sharply contested in the wars between\r\nthe popes and anti-popes.[366]\r\n\r\nThe first church on this site was built in the time of Constantine, on\r\nthe site of the vineyard of the Roman matron Lucina, where she first\r\ngave a burial-place to the apostle. This primal oratory was enlarged\r\ninto a basilica in 386 by the emperors Valentinian II. and Theodosius.\r\nThe church was restored by Leo III. (795--816), and every succeeding\r\ncentury increased its beauty and magnificence. The sovereigns of\r\nEngland, before the Reformation, were protectors of this basilica--as\r\nthose of France are of St. John Lateran, and of Spain of Sta. Maria\r\nMaggiore--and the emblem of the Order of the Garter may still be seen\r\namongst its decorations.\r\n\r\n     \"The very abandonment of this huge pile, standing in solitary\r\n     grandeur on the banks of the Tiber, was one source of its value.\r\n     While it had been kept in perfect repair, little or nothing had\r\n     been done to modernize it, and alter its primitive form and\r\n     ornaments, excepting the later addition of some modern chapels\r\n     above the transept; it stood naked and almost rude, but\r\n     unencumbered with the lumpish and tasteless plaster encasement of\r\n     the old basilica in a modern Berninesque church, which had\r\n     disfigured the Lateran cathedral under pretence of supporting it.\r\n     It remained genuine, though bare, as S. Apollinare in Classe, at\r\n     Ravenna, the city eminently of unspoiled basilicas. No chapels,\r\n     altars, or mural monuments softened the severity of its out-*lines;\r\n     only the series of papal portraits, running round the upper line of\r\n     the walls, redeemed this sternness. But the unbroken files of\r\n     columns along each side, carried the eye forward to the great\r\n     central object, the altar and its 'Confession;' while the secondary\r\n     row of pillars, running behind the principal ones, gave depth and\r\n     shadow, mass and solidity, to back up the noble avenue along which\r\n     one glanced.\"--_Cardinal Wiseman._\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of July, 1823, this magnificent basilica was almost totally\r\ndestroyed by fire, on the night which preceded the death of Pope Pius\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n     \"Quelque-chose de mystérieux s'est lié dans l'esprit des Romains à\r\n     l'incendie de St. Paul, et les gens à l'imagination de ce peuple\r\n     parlent avec ce sombre plaisir qui tient à la mélancolie, ce\r\n     sentiment si rare en Italie, et si fréquent en Allemagne. Dans le\r\n     grand nef, sur le mur, au dessus des colonnes, se trouvait la\r\n     longue suite des portraits de tous les papes, et le peuple de Rome\r\n     voyait avec inquiétude qu'il n'y avait plus de place pour le\r\n     portrait du successeur de Pie VII. De là les fruits de la\r\n     suppression du saint-siège. Le vénérable pontife, qui était presqu'\r\n     un martyre aux yeux de ses sujets, touchait à ses derniers moments\r\n     lorsqu'arriva l'incendie de Saint-Paul. Il eut lieu dans la nuit du\r\n     15 au 16 Juillet, 1823; cette même nuit, le pape, presque mourant,\r\n     fut agité par un songe, qui lui présentait sans cesse un grand\r\n     malheur arrivé à l'église de Rome. Il s'éveilla en sursaut\r\n     plusieurs fois, et demanda s'il n'était rien arrivé de nouveau. Le\r\n     lendemain, pour ne pas aggraver son état, on lui cacha l'incendie,\r\n     et il est mort après sans l'avoir jamais su.\"--_Stendhal_, ii. 94.\r\n\r\n     \"Not a word was said to the dying Pius VII. of the destruction of\r\n     St. Paul. For at St. Paul's he had lived as a quiet monk, engaged\r\n     in study and in teaching, and he loved the place with the force of\r\n     an early attachment. It would have added a mental pang to his\r\n     bodily sufferings to learn the total destruction of that venerable\r\n     sanctuary, in which he had drawn down by prayer the blessings of\r\n     heaven on his youthful labour.\"--_Wiseman, Life of Pius VII._\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the basilica was immediately begun, and a large\r\ncontribution levied for the purpose from all Roman Catholic countries.\r\nIn 1854 it was re-opened in its present form by Pius IX. Its exterior is\r\nbelow contempt; its interior, supported by eighty granite columns, is\r\nmost striking and magnificent, but it is cold and uninteresting when\r\ncompared with the ancient structure, \"rich with inestimable remains of\r\nancient art, and venerable from a thousand associations.\"[367]\r\n\r\nIf we approach the basilica by the door on the side of the monastery, we\r\nenter, first, a portico, containing a fine statue of Gregory XVI., and\r\nmany fragments of the ancient mosaics, collected after the fire;--then,\r\na series of small chapels which were not burnt, from the last of which\r\nladies can look into the beautiful _cloister_ of the twelfth century,\r\nwhich they are not permitted to enter, but which men may visit (through\r\nthe sacristy), and inspect its various architectural remains, and a fine\r\nsarcophagus, adorned with reliefs of the story of Apollo and Marsyas.\r\n\r\nThe church is entered by the south end of the transept. Hence we look\r\ndown upon the nave (306 feet long and 222 wide) with its four ranges of\r\ngranite columns (quarried near the Lago Maggiore), surmounted by a\r\nmosaic series of portraits of the popes, each five feet in\r\ndiameter,--most of them of course being imaginary. The grand triumphal\r\narch which separates the transept from the nave is a relic of the old\r\nbasilica, and was built by Galla-Placidia, sister of Honorius, in 440.\r\nOn the side towards the nave it is adorned with a mosaic of Christ\r\nadored by the twenty-four elders, and the four beasts of the\r\nRevelation;--on that towards the transept by the figure of the Saviour,\r\nbetween St Peter and St. Paul.\r\n\r\nIt bears two inscriptions, the first:\r\n\r\n    \"Theodosius cœpit,--perfecit Honorius aulam\r\n    Doctoris mundi sacratam corpore Pauli.\"\r\n\r\nThe other, especially interesting as the only inscription commemorating\r\nthe great pope who defended Rome against Attila:\r\n\r\n    \"Placidiæ pia mens operis decus homne (_sic_) paterni\r\n    Gaudet pontificis studio splendere Leonis.\"\r\n\r\nThe mosaics of the tribune, also preserved from the fire, were designed\r\nby _Cavallini_, a pupil of Giotto, in the thirteenth century, and were\r\nerected by Honorius III. They represent the Saviour with St. Peter and\r\nSt Andrew on the right, and St Paul and St Luke on the left,--and\r\nbeneath these twelve apostles and two angels. The Holy Innocents\r\n(supposed to be buried in this church!) are represented lying at the\r\nfeet of our Saviour.\r\n\r\n     \"In the mosaics of the old basilica of S. Paolo the Holy Innocents\r\n     were represented by a group of small figures holding palms, and\r\n     placed immediately beneath the altar or throne, sustaining the\r\n     gospel, the cross, and the instruments of the passion of our Lord.\r\n     Over these figures was the inscription, H. I. S.\r\n     INNOCENTES.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\nBeneath the triumphal arch stands the ugly modern baldacchino, which\r\nencloses the ancient altar canopy, erected, as its inscription tells us,\r\nby Arnolphus and his pupil Petrus, in 1285. In front is the\r\n\"Confession,\" where the Apostle of the Gentiles is believed to repose.\r\nThe baldacchino is inscribed:\r\n\r\n    \"Tu es vas electionis,\r\n    Sancte Paule Apostole,\r\n    Prædicator veritatis\r\n    In universo mundo.\"\r\n\r\nIt is supported by four pillars of Oriental alabaster, presented by\r\nMehemet Ali, pasha of Egypt. The altars of malachite, at the ends of the\r\ntransepts, were given by the Emperor Nicholas of Russia.\r\n\r\n     \"Les schismatiques et les mussulmans eux-mêmes sont venus rendre\r\n     hommage à ce souverain de la parole, qui entraînait les peuples au\r\n     martyre et subjuguait toutes les nations.\"--_Une Chrétienne à\r\n     Rome._\r\n\r\nIn a building so entirely modern, there are naturally few individual\r\nobjects of interest. Among those saved[368] from the old basilica, is\r\nthe magnificent paschal candlestick, covered with sculpture in\r\nhigh-relief. The altar at the south end of the transept has an\r\naltar-piece representing the Assumption, by _Agricola_, and statues of\r\nSt. Benedict, _Baini_, and Sta. Scholastica, by _Tenerani_. Of the two\r\nchapels between this and the tribune, the first has a statue of St.\r\nBenedict by _Tenerani_; the second, the Cappella del Coro, was saved\r\nfrom the fire, and is by _Carlo Maderno_.\r\n\r\nThe altar at the north end of the transept is dedicated to St. Paul, and\r\nhas a picture of his conversion, by _Camuccini_. At the sides are\r\nstatues of St. Gregory by _Laboureur_ and of S. Romualdo by _Stocchi_.\r\nOf the chapels between this and the tribune, the first, dedicated to St.\r\nStephen, has a statue of the saint, by _Rinaldi_; the second is\r\ndedicated to St. Bridget (Brigitta Brahe), and contains the famous\r\ncrucifix of Pietro Cavallini, which is said to have spoken to her in\r\n1370.\r\n\r\n     \"Not far from the chancel is a beautiful chapel, dedicated to St.\r\n     Bridget, and ornamented with her statue in marble. During her\r\n     residence in Rome, she frequently came to pray in this church; and\r\n     here is preserved, as a holy relic, the cross from which, during\r\n     her ecstatic devotion, she seemed to hear a voice\r\n     proceeding.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\nThe upper walls of the nave are decorated with frescoes by _Galiardi_,\r\n_Podesti_, and other modern artists.\r\n\r\nThe two great festivals of St. Paul are solemnly observed in this\r\nbasilica upon January 25 and June 30, and that of the Holy Innocents\r\nupon December 28.\r\n\r\nVery near S. Paolo, the main branch of the little river Almo, the\r\n\"cursuque brevissimus Almo\" of Ovid, falls into the Tiber. This is the\r\nspot where the priests of Cybele used to wash her statue and the sacred\r\nvessels of her temple, and to raise their loud annual lamentation for\r\nthe death of her lover, the shepherd Atys:\r\n\r\n    \"Est locus, in Tiberim quo lubricus influit Almo,\r\n      Et nomen magno perdit ab amne minor,\r\n    Illic purpurea canus cum veste sacerdos,\r\n      Almonis dominam sacraque lavit aquis.\"\r\n\r\n    _Ovid, Fast._ iv. 337.\r\n\r\n    \"Phrygiæque matris Almo quà levat ferrum.\"\r\n\r\n    _Martial, Ep._ iii. 472.\r\n\r\n     \"Un vieux prêtre de Cybèle, vêtu de pourpre, y lavait chaque année\r\n     la pierre sacrée de Pessinunte, tandis que d'autres prêtres\r\n     poussaient des hurlements, frappaient sur le tambour de basque\r\n     qu'on place aux mains de Cybèle, soufflaient avec fureur dans les\r\n     flûtes phrygiennes, et que l'on se donnait la discipline,--ni plus\r\n     ni moins qu'on le fait encore dans l'église des _Caravite_,--avec\r\n     des fouets garnis de petits cailloux ou d'osselets.\"--_Ampère,\r\n     Hist. Rom._ iii. 145.\r\n\r\nThe Campagna on this side of Rome is perhaps more stricken by malaria\r\nthan any other part, and is in consequence more utterly deserted. That\r\nthis terrible scourge has followed upon the destruction of the villas\r\nand gardens which once filled the suburbs of Rome, and that it did not\r\nalways exist here, is evident from the account of Pliny, who says:\r\n\r\n     \"Such is the happy and beautiful amenity of the Campagna that it\r\n     seems to be the work of a rejoicing nature. For truly so it appears\r\n     in the vital and perennial salubrity of its atmosphere (_vitalis ac\r\n     perennis salubritatis cœli temperies_), in its fertile plains,\r\n     sunny hills, healthy woods, thick groves, rich varieties of trees,\r\n     breezy mountains, fertility in fruits, vines, and olives, its noble\r\n     flocks of sheep, abundant herds of cattle, numerous lakes, and\r\n     wealth of rivers and streams pouring in upon its many seaports, in\r\n     whose lap the commerce of the world lies, and which run largely\r\n     into the sea as it were to help mortals.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the emperors, the town of Ostia (founded by Ancus Martius) reached\r\nsuch a degree of prosperity, that its suburbs are described as joining\r\nthose of Rome, so that one magnificent street almost united the two.\r\nThere is now, beyond S. Paolo, a road through a desert, only one human\r\nhabitation breaking the utter solitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAS BORGHESE, MADAMA, AND MELLINI.\r\n\r\n     Protestant Churches--Villa Borghese--Raphael's Villa--Casino and\r\n     Villa of Papa Giulio--(Claude's\r\n     Villa--Arco-Oscuro--Acqua-Acetosa)--Chapel of St.\r\n     Andrew--Ponte-Molle (Castle of Crescenza--Prima Porta--The\r\n     Crimera--The Allia)--(The Via Cassia)--Villa Madama--Monte\r\n     Mario--Villa Mellini--Porta Angelica.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately outside the Porta del Popolo, on the left, are the English\r\nand American churches.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the position selected for these buildings, it is to be\r\n     observed that, although restricted by the regulations of the Roman\r\n     Catholic hierarchy to a locality outside the walls, the greatest\r\n     possible attention has been paid to the convenience of the English,\r\n     the great majority of whose dwelling-houses are in this immediate\r\n     quarter. The English church in Rome, therefore, though nominally\r\n     outside the walls, is really, as regards centrality, in the very\r\n     heart of the city. The greatest possible facilities are afforded by\r\n     the authorities to our countrymen in all matters relating to the\r\n     establishment; and though the general behaviour of the Roman\r\n     inhabitants is such as to render the precaution almost unnecessary,\r\n     the protection of the police and military is invariably afforded\r\n     during the hours of divine service.... Whatever be the\r\n     disagreements on points of religious faith between Protestant and\r\n     Catholic, there is at least one point of feeling in common between\r\n     both in this respect; for the streets are tranquil, the shops are\r\n     shut, the demeanour of the people is decent and orderly, and,\r\n     notwithstanding the distance from England, Sunday feels more like\r\n     a Sunday at Rome than in any other town in Europe.\"--_Sir G. Head's\r\n     \"Tour in Rome.\"_\r\n\r\nThe papal government of Rome had more tolerance for a religion which was\r\nnot its own than that of the early emperors. Augustus refused to allow\r\nthe performance of Egyptian rites within a mile of the city walls.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the Gate is the handsome entrance of the beautiful\r\n_Villa Borghese_, most liberally thrown open to the public on every day\r\nexcept Monday, when the Villa Doria is open.\r\n\r\n     \"The entrance to the Villa Borghese is just outside the Porta del\r\n     Popolo. Passing beneath that not very impressive specimen of\r\n     Michael Angelo's architecture, a minute's walk will transport the\r\n     visitor from the small uneasy lava stones of the Roman pavement,\r\n     into broad, gravelled carriage drives, whence a little further\r\n     stroll brings him to the soft turf of a beautiful seclusion. A\r\n     seclusion, but seldom a solitude; for priest, noble, and populace,\r\n     stranger and native, all who breathe the Roman air, find free\r\n     admission, and come hither to taste the languid enjoyment of the\r\n     day-dream which they call life.\r\n\r\n     \"The scenery is such as arrays itself to the imagination when we\r\n     read the beautiful old myths, and fancy a brighter sky, a softer\r\n     turf, a more picturesque arrangement of venerable trees, than we\r\n     find in the rude and untrained landscapes of the western world. The\r\n     ilex-trees, so ancient and time-honoured are they, seem to have\r\n     lived for ages undisturbed, and to feel no dread of profanation by\r\n     the axe anymore than overthrow by the thunder-stroke. It has\r\n     already passed out of their dreamy old memories that only a few\r\n     years ago they were grievously imperilled by the Gauls' last\r\n     assault upon the walls of Rome. As if confident in the long peace\r\n     of their lifetime, they assume attitudes of evident repose. They\r\n     lean over the green turf in ponderous grace, throwing abroad their\r\n     great branches without danger of interfering with other trees,\r\n     though other majestic trees grow near enough for dignified society,\r\n     but too distant for constraint. Never was there a more venerable\r\n     quietude than that which sleeps among their sheltering boughs;\r\n     never a sweeter sunshine than that which gladdens the gentle bloom\r\n     which these leafy patriarchs strive to diffuse over the swelling\r\n     and subsiding lawns.\r\n\r\n     \"In other portions of the grounds the stone pines lift their dense\r\n     clumps of branches upon a slender length of stem, so high that they\r\n     look like green islands in the air, flinging down a shadow upon the\r\n     turf so far off that you scarcely know which tree has made it.\r\n\r\n     \"Again, there are avenues of cypress, resembling dark flames of\r\n     huge funeral candles, which spread dusk and twilight round about\r\n     them instead of cheerful radiance. The more open spots are all\r\n     a-bloom, early in the season, with anemones of wondrous size, both\r\n     white and rose-coloured, and violets that betray themselves by\r\n     their rich fragrance, even if their blue eyes fail to meet your\r\n     own. Daisies, too, are abundant, but larger than the modest little\r\n     English flower, and therefore of small account.\r\n\r\n     \"These wooded and flowery lawns are more beautiful than the finest\r\n     English park scenery, more touching, more impressive, through the\r\n     neglect that leaves nature so much to her own ways and methods.\r\n     Since man seldom interferes with her, she sets to work in her quiet\r\n     way and makes herself at home. There is enough of human care, it is\r\n     true, bestowed long ago, and still bestowed, to prevent wildness\r\n     from growing into deformity; and the result is an ideal landscape,\r\n     a woodland scene that seems to have been projected out of the\r\n     poet's mind. If the ancient Faun were other than a mere creation of\r\n     old poetry, and could reappear anywhere, it must be in such a scene\r\n     as this.\r\n\r\n     \"In the openings of the wood there are fountains plashing into\r\n     marble basons, the depths of which are shaggy with water-weeds; or\r\n     they tumble like natural cascades from rock to rock, sending their\r\n     murmur afar, to make the quiet and silence more appreciable.\r\n     Scattered here and there with careless artifice, stand old altars,\r\n     bearing Roman inscriptions. Statues, grey with the long corrosion\r\n     of even that soft atmosphere, half hide and half reveal themselves,\r\n     high on pedestals, or perhaps fallen and broken on the turf.\r\n     Terminal figures, columns of marble or granite porticoes and\r\n     arches, are seen in the vistas of the wood-paths, either veritable\r\n     relics of antiquity, or with so exquisite a touch of artful ruin on\r\n     them that they are better than if really antique. At all events,\r\n     grass grows on the tops of the shattered pillars, and weeds and\r\n     flowers root themselves in the chinks of the massive arches and\r\n     fronts of temples, as if this were the thousandth summer since\r\n     their winged seeds alighted there.\r\n\r\n     \"What a strange idea--what a needless labour--to construct\r\n     artificial ruins in Rome, the native soil of ruin! But even these\r\n     sportive imitations, wrought by man in emulation of what time has\r\n     done to temples and palaces, are perhaps centuries old, and,\r\n     beginning as illusions, have grown to be venerable in sober\r\n     earnest. The result of all is a scene, such as is to be found\r\n     nowhere save in these princely villa-residences in the\r\n     neighbourhood of Rome; a scene that must have required generations\r\n     and ages, during which growth, decay, and man's intelligence\r\n     wrought kindly together, to render it so gently wild as we behold\r\n     it now.\r\n\r\n     \"The final charm is bestowed by the malaria. There is a piercing,\r\n     thrilling, delicious kind of regret in the idea of so much beauty\r\n     being thrown away, or only enjoyable at its half-development, in\r\n     winter and early spring, and never to be dwelt amongst, as the home\r\n     scenery of any human being. For if you come hither in summer, and\r\n     stray through these glades in the golden sunset, fever walks\r\n     arm-in-arm with you, and death awaits you at the end of the dim\r\n     vista. Thus the scene is like Eden in its loveliness; like Eden,\r\n     too, in the fatal spell that removes it beyond the scope of man's\r\n     actual possessions.\"--_Transformation_.\r\n\r\n     \"Oswald et Corinne terminèrent leur voyage de Rome par la\r\n     Villa-Borghèse, celui de tous les jardins et de tous les palais\r\n     romains où les splendeurs de la nature et des arts sont rassemblées\r\n     avec le plus de goût et d'éclat. On y voit des arbres de toutes les\r\n     espèces et des eaux magnifiques. Une réunion incroyable de statues,\r\n     de vases, de sarcophages antiques, se mêlent avec la fraîcheur de\r\n     la jeune nature du sud. La mythologie des anciens y semble ranimée.\r\n     Les naïades sont placées sur le bord des ondes, les nymphes dans\r\n     les bois dignes d'elles, les tombeaux sous les ombrages élyséens;\r\n     la statue d'Esculape est au milieu d'une île; celle de Vénus semble\r\n     sortir des ondes; Ovide et Virgile pourraient se promener dans ce\r\n     beau lieu; et se croire encore au siècle d'Auguste. Les\r\n     chefs-d'œuvre de sculpture que renferme le palais, lui donnent\r\n     une magnificence à jamais nouvelle. On aperçoit de loin à travers\r\n     les arbres, la ville de Rome et Saint-Pierre, et la campagne, et\r\n     les longues arcades, débris des aqueducs qui transportaient les\r\n     sources des montagnes dans l'ancienne Rome. Tout est là pour la\r\n     pensée, pour l'imagination, pour la rêverie.\r\n\r\n     \"Les sensations les plus pures se confondent avec les plaisirs de\r\n     l'âme, et donnent l'idée d'un bonheur parfait; mais quand on\r\n     demande, pourquoi ce séjour ravissant n'est-il pas habité? l'on\r\n     vous répond que le mauvais air (_la cattiva aria_) ne permet pas\r\n     d'y vivre pendant l'été.\"--_Madame de Staël._\r\n\r\nThe _Casino_, at the further end of the villa, built by Cardinal Scipio\r\nBorghese, the favourite nephew of Paul V., contains a collection of\r\nsculpture. The first room entered is a great hall, with a ceiling\r\npainted by _Mario Rossi_, and a floor paved with an ancient mosaic\r\ndiscovered at the Torre Nuova (one of the principal Borghese farms) in\r\n1835.\r\n\r\n     \"Cette mosaïque fort curieuse nous offre et les combats des\r\n     gladiateurs entre eux et leurs luttes avec les animaux féroces.\r\n     Cette mosaïque est d'un dessin aussi barbare que les scènes\r\n     représentées; tout est en harmonie, le sujet et le tableau. Le\r\n     sentiment de répulsion qu'inspire la cruauté romaine n'en est que\r\n     plus complet; celle-ci n'est point adoucie par l'art et paraît dans\r\n     toute sa laideur.\r\n\r\n     \"On voit les gladiateurs poursuivre, s'attaquer, se massacrer,\r\n     couverts d'armures qui ressemblent à celle des chevaliers: vous\r\n     diriez une odieuse parodie du moyen âge.

Chantrey,\r\n     wishing to do honour to the artist, insisted upon holding the taper\r\n     for the best light himself, which gave rise to Moore's lines:\r\n\r\n    \"When he, thy peer in art and fame,\r\n      Hung o'er the marble with delight;\r\n    And while his ling'ring hand would steal\r\n        O'er every grace the taper's rays,\r\n    Gave thee, with all the generous zeal\r\n    Such master-spirits only feel,\r\n        The best of fame--a rival's praise!\"\r\n\r\nIn the upper part of the grounds, not far from the walls of Rome, stood\r\nthe Villa Olgiati, once the _Villa of Raphael_. It contained three rooms\r\nornamented with frescoes from the hand of the great master. The best of\r\nthese are now preserved in a room at the end of the gallery in the\r\nBorghese Palace. The villa was destroyed during the siege of Rome in\r\n1849, when many of the fine old trees were cut down on this side of the\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n     \"The Casino of Raphael was unfurnished, except with casks of wine,\r\n     and uninhabited, except by a _contadina_. The chamber which was the\r\n     bedroom of Raphael was entirely adorned with the work of his own\r\n     hands. It was a small pleasant apartment, looking out on a little\r\n     green lawn, fenced in with trees irregularly planted. The walls\r\n     were covered with arabesques, in various whimsical and beautiful\r\n     designs--such as the sports of children; Loves balancing themselves\r\n     on poles, or mounted on horseback, full of glee and mirth; Fauns\r\n     and Satyrs; Mercury and Minerva; flowers and curling tendrils, and\r\n     every beautiful composition that could suggest itself to a classic\r\n     imagination in its most sportive mood. The cornice was supported by\r\n     painted Caryatides. The coved roof was adorned with four\r\n     medallions, containing portraits of his mistress, the Fornarina--it\r\n     seemed as if he took pleasure in multiplying that beloved object,\r\n     so that wherever his eyes turned her image might meet them. There\r\n     were three other paintings, one representing a Terminus with a\r\n     target before it, and a troop of men shooting at it with bows and\r\n     arrows which they had stolen from unsuspecting Cupid, lying asleep\r\n     on the ground. The second represented a figure, apparently a god,\r\n     seated at the foot of a couch, with an altar before him, in a\r\n     temple or rotunda, and from the gardens which appeared in\r\n     perspective through its open intercolumniations, were seen\r\n     advancing a troop of gay young nymphs, bearing vases full of roses\r\n     upon their heads.[369] ... The last and best of these paintings\r\n     represented the nuptials of Alexander the Great and\r\n     Roxana.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\nJust outside the Porta del Popolo, a small gate on the left of the Villa\r\nBorghese leads to the _Villa Esmeade_,--the property of an\r\nEnglishman,--of considerable extent, and possessing beautiful views of\r\nRome and the Sabine mountains from its heights, which are adorned with a\r\nfew ancient statues and vases.\r\n\r\nUnpleasantly situated near the gate of the Villa Borghese is the\r\nPig-market. Fortunately the manner of pig-killing at Rome is not so\r\nnoisy as that in northern countries. The throats of the animals are not\r\ncut, but they are pierced under the left shoulder with a long pointed\r\nbodkin, which kills them almost instantly--no blood flowing. In a very\r\nfew minutes a whole pen-full of pigs can be stilettoed in this\r\nmanner--indeed, for any one interested in farming matters, the slaughter\r\nof the Roman pigs is a sight worth seeing.\r\n\r\nWe now enter upon the ugly dusty road which leads in a straight line to\r\nthe Milvian Bridge. By this road the last triumphal procession entered\r\nRome--that of the Emperor Honorius and Stilicho (described by the poet\r\nClaudian) in A.D. 403--a whole century having then elapsed since the\r\nRomans had beheld their last triumph--that of Diocletian.\r\n\r\nUnder the line of hills (Monte Parioli) on the right of the road are the\r\n_Catacombs of St. Valentine_. On the other side, the same hills are\r\nundermined by the _Catacombs of SS. Gianutus and Basilla_.\r\n\r\nHalf a mile from the gate, rises conspicuously on the right of the road\r\nthe _Casino of Papa Giulio_, with picturesque overhanging cornices and\r\nsculptured fountain. The courtyard has a quaint cloister. This is the\r\n\"Villino,\" and, far behind, but formerly connected with it by a long\r\ncorridor, is the _Villa of Papa Giulio_, containing several rooms with\r\nvery richly decorated ceilings, painted by _Taddeo Zucchero_. Michael\r\nAngelo was consulted by the pope as to the building of this villa, and\r\nVasari made drawings for it, but \"the actual architect was Vignola, a\r\nmodest genius, who had to suffer severely, together with all his\r\nfellow-workmen, from the tracasseries of the pope's favourite, the\r\nbishop Aliotti, whom the less-enduring Michael Angelo was wont to\r\nnickname Monsignor Tante Cose.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The villa of Papa Giulio is still visited by the stranger.\r\n     Restored to the presence of those times, he ascends the spacious\r\n     steps to the gallery, whence he overlooks the whole extent of Rome,\r\n     from Monte Mario, with all the windings of the Tiber. The building\r\n     of this palace, the laying out of its gardens, were the daily\r\n     occupation of Pope Julius III. The place was designed by himself,\r\n     but was never completed: every day brought with it some new\r\n     suggestion or caprice, which the architects must at once set\r\n     themselves to realize. This pontiff desired to forward the\r\n     interests of his family; but he was not inclined to involve himself\r\n     in dangerous perplexities on their account. The pleasant blameless\r\n     life of his villa was that which was best suited to him. He gave\r\n     entertainments, which he enlivened with proverbial and other modes\r\n     of expression, that sometimes mingled blushes with the smiles of\r\n     his guests. In the important affairs of the Church and State, he\r\n     took no other share than was absolutely inevitable. This Pope\r\n     Julius died March 23, 1555.\"--_Ranke's Hist. of the Popes._\r\n\r\n     \"C'est uniquement comme protecteur des arts et comme prince\r\n     magnifique que nous pouvons envisager Jules III. Sa mauvaise santé\r\n     lui faisait rechercher le repos et les douceurs d'une vie grande et\r\n     libre. Aussi avait-il fait édifier avec une sorte de tendresse\r\n     paternelle cette belle _villa_, qui est célèbre, dans l'histoire de\r\n     l'art, sous le nom de Vigne de pape Jules. Michel-Ange, Vasari,\r\n     Vignole en avaient dessiné les profils; les nymphées et les\r\n     fontaines étaient d'Ammanati; les peintures de Taddeo Zuccari. Du\r\n     haut d'une galerie élégante on découvrait les sept collines, et\r\n     d'ombreuses allées, tracées par Jules III., égaraient les pas du\r\n     vieillard dans ce dédale de tertres et de vallées qui sépare le\r\n     pont où périt Maxence de la ville éternelle.\"--_Gournerie, Rome\r\n     Chrétienne_, ii. 172.\r\n\r\nPope Julius used to come hither, with all his court, from the Vatican by\r\nwater. The richly-decorated barge, filled with venerable ecclesiastics,\r\ngliding between the osier-fringed banks of the yellow Tiber, with its\r\ndistant line of churches and palaces, would make a fine subject for a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite the Casino Papa Giulio, on the further bank of the\r\nTiber, is the picturesque classic _Villa of Claude Lorraine_, whither he\r\nwas wont to retire during the summer months, residing in the winter in\r\nthe Tempietto at the head of the Trinità steps. This villa is best seen\r\nfrom the walk by the river-side, which is reached by turning at once to\r\nthe left on coming out of the Porta del Popolo. Hence it makes a good\r\nforeground to the view of the city and distant heights of the Janiculan.\r\n\r\n     \"This road is called 'Poussin's Walk,' because the great painter\r\n     used to go along it from Rome to his villa near Ponte Molle. One\r\n     sees here an horizon such as one often finds in Poussin's\r\n     pictures.\"--_Frederika Bremer._\r\n\r\nClose to the Villa Papa Giulio is the tunnel called _Arco Oscuro_,\r\npassing which, a steep lane with a beautiful view towards St. Peter's,\r\nascends between the hillsides of the Monte Parione, and descends on the\r\nother side (following the turn to the right) to the Tiber bank, about\r\ntwo miles from Rome, where is situated the _Acqua Acetosa_, a refreshing\r\nmineral spring like seltzer water, enclosed in a fountain erected by\r\nBernini for Alexander VII. There is a lovely view from hence across the\r\nCampagna in the direction of Fidenæ (Castel Giubeleo) and the Tor di\r\nQuinto.\r\n\r\n     \"A green hill, one of those bare table-lands so common in the\r\n     Campagna, rises on the right. Ascend it to where a broad furrow in\r\n     the slope seems to mark the site of an ancient road. You are on a\r\n     plateau, almost quadrangular in form, rising steeply to the height\r\n     of nearly two hundred feet above the Tiber, and isolated, save at\r\n     one angle, where it is united to other high ground by a narrow\r\n     isthmus. Not a tree--not a shrub on its turf-grown surface--not a\r\n     house--not a ruin--not one stone upon another, to tell you that the\r\n     site had been inhabited. Yet here once stood Antemnæ, the city of\r\n     many towers,[370] one of the most ancient of Italy![371] Not a\r\n     trace remains above ground. Even the broken pottery, that\r\n     infallible indicator of bygone civilisation, which marks the site\r\n     and determines the limits of habitation on many a now desolate spot\r\n     of classic ground, is here so overgrown with herbage that the eye\r\n     of an antiquary would alone detect it. It is a site strong by\r\n     nature, and well adapted for a city, as cities then were; for it is\r\n     scarcely larger than the Palatine Hill, which, though at first it\r\n     embraced the whole of Rome, was afterwards too small for a single\r\n     palace. It has a peculiar interest as one of the three cities of\r\n     Sabina,[372] whose daughters, ravished by the followers of Romulus,\r\n     became the mothers of the Roman race. Antemnæ was the nearest city\r\n     to Rome--only three miles distant--and therefore must have suffered\r\n     most from the inhospitable violence of the Romans.\"--_Dennis'\r\n     Cities of Etruria_, ch. iii.\r\n\r\nThere is a walk--rather dangerous for carriages--by the river, from\r\nhence, to the Ponte Molle. Here Miss Bathurst was drowned by being\r\nthrown from her horse into the Tiber.\r\n\r\nThe river bank presents a series of picturesque views, though the yellow\r\nTiber in no way reminds us of Virgil's description:\r\n\r\n    \"Cæruleus Tybris cœlo gratissimus amnis.\"\r\n\r\n    _Æn._ viii. 64.\r\n\r\nContinuing to follow the main road, on the left is the round _Church of\r\nSt. Andrew_, with a Doric portico, built by Vignola, in 1527, to\r\ncommemorate the deliverance of Clement VII. from the Germans.\r\n\r\nFurther, on the right, is another _Chapel in honour of St. Andrew's\r\nHead_.\r\n\r\n     \"One of the most curious instances of relique worship occurred here\r\n     in the reign of Æneas Sylvius, Pope Pius II. The head of St. Andrew\r\n     was brought in stately procession from the fortress of Narni,\r\n     whither, as the Turks invaded the Morea, it had been brought for\r\n     safety from Patras. It was intended that the most glorious heads of\r\n     St. Peter and St. Paul should go forth to meet that of their\r\n     brother apostle. But the mass of gold which enshrined, the cumbrous\r\n     iron which protected these reliques, was too heavy to be moved; so,\r\n     without them, the pope, the cardinals, the whole population of\r\n     Rome, thronged forth to the meadows near the Milvian Bridge. The\r\n     pope made an eloquent address to the head, a hymn was sung\r\n     entreating the saint's aid in the discomfiture of the Turks. It\r\n     rested that day on the altar of Santa Maria del Popolo, and was\r\n     then conveyed through the city, decorated with all splendour, to\r\n     St. Peter's. Cardinal Bessarion preached a sermon, and the head was\r\n     deposited with those of his brother apostles under the\r\n     high-altar_.\"--Milman's Latin Christianity._\r\n\r\nA mile and a half from the gate, the Tiber is crossed by the _Ponte\r\nMolle_, built by Pius VII. in 1815, on the site and foundations of the\r\nPons Milvius, which was erected B.C. 109 by the Censor M. Æmilius\r\nScaurus. It was here that, on the night of December 3, B.C. 63, Cicero\r\ncaptured the emissaries of the Allobrogi, who were engaged in the\r\nconspiracy of Catiline. Hence, on October 27, A.D. 312, Maxentius was\r\nthrown into the river and drowned after his defeat by Constantine at the\r\nSaxa Rubra. It was on this occasion that the seven-branched candlestick\r\nof Jerusalem was dropped into the river, where it has probably ever\r\nsince been embedded. The statues of Our Saviour and John the Baptist, at\r\nthe further entrance of the bridge, are by _Mochi_.\r\n\r\nHere are a number of taverns and _Trattorie_, much frequented by the\r\nlower ranks of the Roman people, and for which especial open omnibuses\r\nrun from the Porta del Popolo. Similar places of public amusement seem\r\nto have existed here from imperial times. Ovid describes the people\r\ncoming out hither in troops by the Via Flaminia to celebrate the fête of\r\nAnna Perenna, an old woman who supplied the plebs with cakes during the\r\nretreat to the Mons Sacer, but who afterwards, from a similitude of\r\nnames, was confounded with Anna, sister of Dido.\r\n\r\n    \"Idibus est Annæ festum geniale Perennæ,\r\n      Haud procul a ripis, advena Tibri, tuis.\r\n    Plebs venit, ac virides passim disjecta per herbas\r\n      Potat; et accumbit cum pare quisque sua.\r\n    Sub Jove pars durat; pauci tentoria ponunt;\r\n      Sunt, quibus e ramo frondea facta casa est:\r\n    Pars, ubi pro rigidis calamos statuere columnis,\r\n      Desuper extentas imposuere togas.\r\n    Sole tamen vinoque calent; annosque precantur,\r\n      Quot sumant cyathos, ad numerumque bibunt.\r\n    Inventes illic, qui Nestoris ebibat annos:\r\n      Quæ sit per calices facta Sibylla suos.\r\n    Illic et cantant, quidquid didicere theatris,\r\n      Et jactant faciles ad sua verba manus:\r\n    Et ducunt posito duras cratere choreas,\r\n      Multaque diffusis saltat amica comis.\r\n    Quum redeunt, titubant, et sunt spectacula vulgo,\r\n      Et fortunatos obvia turba vocat.\r\n    Occurri nuper. Visa est mihi digna relatu\r\n      Pompa: senem potum pota trahebat anus.\"\r\n\r\n    _Fast._ iii. 523.\r\n\r\nHere three roads meet. That on the right is the old Via Flaminia, begun\r\nB.C. 220 by C. Flaminius the censor. This was the great northern road of\r\nItaly, which, issuing from the city by the Porta Ratumena, which was\r\nclose to the tomb of Bibulus, followed a line a little east of the\r\nmodern Corso, and passed the Aurelian wall by the Porta Flaminia, near\r\nthe present Porta del Popolo. It extended to Ariminum (Rimini), a\r\ndistance of 210 miles.[373]\r\n\r\n(Following this road for about 1½ mile, on the left are the ruins\r\ncalled _Tor di Quinto_. A little further on the right of the road are\r\nsome tufa-rocks, with an injured tomb of the Nasones. Following the\r\nvalley under these rocks to the left we reach (1½ mile) the fine\r\n_Castle of Crescenza_, now a farm-*house, picturesquely situated on a\r\nrocky knoll,--once inhabited by Poussin, and reproduced in the\r\nbackground of many of his pictures. In the interior are some remains of\r\nancient frescoes.\r\n\r\nOn this road, seven miles from Rome, is Prima Porta, where are the ruins\r\nof the _Villa of Livia_, wife of Augustus, and mother of Tiberius. When\r\nfirst opened, several small rooms in the villa, supposed to be baths,\r\nwere covered with frescoes and arabesques in a state of the most\r\nmarvellous beauty and preservation, but they are now greatly injured by\r\ndamp and exposure. From the character of the paintings, a trellis-*work\r\nof fruit and flowers, amid which birds and insects are sporting, it is\r\nsupposed that they are the work of Ludius, described in Pliny, who \"divi\r\nAugusti ætate primus instituit amœnissimam parietum picturam, villas\r\net porticus ac topiaria opera, lucos, nemora ... blandissimo aspectu\r\nminimoque impendio.\" It was here that the magnificent statue of\r\nAugustus, now in the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican, was discovered in\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n     \"What Augustus's affection for Livia was, is well known. 'Preserve\r\n     the remembrance of a husband who has loved you very tenderly,' were\r\n     the last words of the emperor, as he lay on his death-bed. And when\r\n     asked how she contrived to retain his affection, Dion Cassius tells\r\n     us that she replied, 'My secret is very simple: I have made it the\r\n     study of my life to please him, and I have never manifested any\r\n     indiscreet curiosity with regard to his public or private\r\n     affairs.'\"--_Weld._\r\n\r\nJust beyond this, the Tiber receives the little river _Valca_,\r\nconsidered to be identical with the Crimera. Hither the devoted clan of\r\nthe Fabii, 4000 in number, retired from Rome, having offered to sustain,\r\nat their own cost and risk, the war which Rome was then carrying on\r\nagainst Veii. Here, because they felt a position within the city\r\nuntenable on account of the animosity of their fellow-patricians, which\r\nhad been excited by their advocacy of the agrarian law, and their\r\npopularity with the plebeians, they established themselves on a hillock\r\noverhanging the river, which they fortified, and where they dwelt for\r\nthree years. At the end of that time the Veiientines, by letting loose\r\nherds of cattle like the _Vaccine_, which one still sees wandering in\r\nthat part of the Campagna, drew them into an ambuscade, and they were\r\nall cut off to a man. According to Dionysius, a portion of the little\r\narmy remained to guard the fort, and the rest fled to another hill,\r\nperhaps that now known as Vaccareccia. These were the last to be\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\n     \"They fought from dawn to sunset. The enemy slain by their hand\r\n     formed heaps of corpses which barred their passage.\"--They were\r\n     summoned to surrender, but they preferred to die.--\"The people of\r\n     Veii showered arrows and stones upon them from a distance, not\r\n     daring to approach them again. The arrows fell like thick snow. The\r\n     Fabii, with swords blunted by force of striking, with bucklers\r\n     broken, continued to fight, snatching fresh swords from the hands\r\n     of the enemy, and rushing upon them with the ferocity of wild\r\n     beasts.\"--_Dionysius_, ix. 21.\r\n\r\nA little beyond this, ten miles from Rome, is the stream _Scannabecchi_,\r\nwhich descends from the Crustuminian Hills, and is identical with the\r\nAllia, \"infaustum Allia nomen,\" where the Romans were (B.C. 390)\r\nentirely defeated with great slaughter by the Gauls, before the capture\r\nof the city, in which the aged senators were massacred at the doors of\r\ntheir houses.\r\n\r\nIt was in the lands lying between the villa of Livia and the Tiber that\r\n_Saxa Rubra_[374] was situated, where Constantine (A.D. 312) gained his\r\ndecisive victory over Maxentius, who, while attempting to escape over\r\nthe Milvian Bridge, was pushed by the throng of fugitives into the\r\nTiber, and perished, engulfed in the mud. The scene is depicted in the\r\nfamous fresco of Giulio Romano, in the stanze of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the river, Castel Giubeleo, on the site of the\r\nEtruscan Fidenæ, is a conspicuous object.)\r\n\r\n(The direct road from the Ponte Molle is the ancient _Via Cassia_, which\r\nmust be followed for some distance by those who make the interesting\r\nexcursions to Veii, Galera, and Bracciano, each easily within the\r\ncompass of a day's expedition. On the left of this road, three miles\r\nfrom Rome, is the fine sarcophagus of Publius Vibius Maximus and his\r\nwife Regina Maxima, popularly known as \"Nero's Tomb.\")\r\n\r\nFollowing the road to the left of the Ponte Molle, we turn up a steep\r\nincline to the deserted _Villa Madama_, built by Giulio Romano, from\r\ndesigns of Raphael for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, afterwards Clement\r\nVII. It derives its name from Margaret of Austria, daughter of Charles\r\nV., and wife, first of Alessandro de' Medici, and then of Ottavio\r\nFarnese, duke of Parma; from this second marriage, it descended through\r\nElisabetta Farnese, to the Bourbon kings of Naples. The neglected halls\r\ncontain some fresco decorations by _Giulio Romano_ and _Giovanni da\r\nUdine_.\r\n\r\n     \"They consist of a series of beautiful little pictures,\r\n     representing the sports of Satyrs and Loves; Juno, attended by her\r\n     peacocks; Jupiter and Ganymede; and various subjects of mythology\r\n     and fable. The paintings in the portico have been of first-rate\r\n     excellence; and I cannot but regret, that designs so beautiful\r\n     should not be engraved before their last traces disappear for ever.\r\n     A deep fringe on one of the deserted chambers, representing angels,\r\n     flowers, Caryatides, &c., by Giulio Romano; and also a fine fresco\r\n     on a ceiling, by Giovanni da Udine, of Phœbus driving his\r\n     heavenly steeds, are in somewhat better preservation.\r\n\r\n     \"It was in the groves that surrounded Villa Madama, that the Pastor\r\n     Fido of Guarini was represented for the first time before a\r\n     brilliant circle of princes and nobles, such as these scenes will\r\n     see no more, and Italy itself could not now produce.\"--_Eaton's\r\n     Rome._\r\n\r\nThe frescoes and arabesques executed here by Giovanni da Udine were\r\nconsidered at the time as among the most successful of his works. Vasari\r\nsays that in these he \"wished to be supreme, and to excel himself.\"\r\nCardinal de' Medici was so delighted with them that he not only heaped\r\nbenefits on all the relations of the painter, but rewarded him with a\r\nrich canonry, which he was allowed to transfer to his brother.\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely doubt from the description of Martial that this villa\r\noccupies the site of that in which the poet came to visit his friend and\r\nnamesake.\r\n\r\n    \"Juli jugera pauca Martialis,\r\n    Hortis Hesperidum beatiora,\r\n    Longo Janiculi jugo recumbunt.\r\n    Lati collibus imminent recessus;\r\n    Et planus modico tumore vertex\r\n    Cœlo perfruitur sereniore:\r\n    Et, curvas nebula tegente valles,\r\n    Solus luce nitet peculiari:\r\n    Puris leniter admoventur astris\r\n    Celsæ culmina delicata villæ.\r\n    Hinc septem dominos videre montes,\r\n    Et totam licet sestimare Romam.\"\r\n\r\nThe Villa Madama is situated on one of the slopes of _Monte Mario_,\r\nwhich is ascended by a winding carriage-road from near the Porta\r\nAngelica. This hill, in ancient times called Clivus Cinnæ, was in the\r\nmiddle ages Monte Malo, and is thus spoken of by Dante (Paradiso, xv.\r\n109). Its name changed to Mario, through Mario Mellini, its possessor in\r\nthe time of Sixtus V. Passing the two churches of Sta. Maria del Rosario\r\nand Sta. Croce di Monte Mario,[375] we reach a gate with an old\r\npine-tree. This is the _Villa Mellini_ (for which an order is supposed\r\nto be necessary, though a franc will usually cause the gates to fly\r\nopen), which possesses a magnificent view over Rome, from its terraces,\r\nlined with ilexes and cypresses.\r\n\r\n     \"The Monte Mario, like Cooper's Hill, is the highest, boldest, and\r\n     most prominent part of the line; it is about the height and\r\n     steepness too of Cooper's Hill, and has the Tiber at the foot of\r\n     it, like the Thames at Anchorwick. To keep up the resemblance,\r\n     there is a sort of terrace at the top of the Monte Mario, planted\r\n     with cypresses, and a villa, though dilapidated, crowns the summit,\r\n     as well as at our old friend above Egham. Here we stood, on a most\r\n     delicious evening, the ilex and the gum-cistus in great profusion\r\n     about us, the slope below full of vines and olives, the cypresses\r\n     above our heads, and before our eyes all that one has read of in\r\n     Roman History--the course of the Tiber between the hills that bound\r\n     it, coming down from Fidenæ and receiving the Allia and the Anio;\r\n     beyond, the Apennines, the distant and higher summits still quite\r\n     white with snow; in front, the Alban Hills; on the right, the\r\n     Campagna to the sea; and just beneath us the whole length of Rome,\r\n     ancient and modern--St. Peter's and the Coliseum, rising as the\r\n     representatives of each--the Pantheon, the Aventine, the Quirinal,\r\n     all the well-known objects distinctly laid before us. One may\r\n     safely say that the world cannot contain many views of such mingled\r\n     beauty and interest as this.\"--_Dr. Arnold._\r\n\r\n     \"Les maisons de campagne des grands seigneurs donnent l'idée de\r\n     cette solitude, de cette indifférence des possesseurs au milieu des\r\n     plus admirables séjours du monde.

Onofrio in Campagna_, with a curious ossuary.)\r\n\r\nJust outside the Porta Angelica was the vineyard in which Alexander VI.\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n     \"This is the manner in which Pope Alexander VI. came to his death.\r\n\r\n     \"The cardinal datary, Arian de Corneto, having received a gracious\r\n     intimation that the pontiff, together with the Duke Valentinos,\r\n     designed to come and sup with him at his vineyard, and that his\r\n     Holiness would bring the supper with him, the cardinal suspected\r\n     that this determination had been taken for the purpose of\r\n     destroying his life by poison, to the end that the duke might have\r\n     his riches and appointments, the rather as he knew that the pope\r\n     had resolved to put him to death by some means, with a view to\r\n     seizing his property as I have said,--which was very great.\r\n     Considering of the means by which he might save himself, he could\r\n     see but one hope of safety--he sent in good time to the pope's\r\n     carver, with whom he had a certain intimacy, desiring that he would\r\n     come to speak with him; who, when he had come to the said cardinal,\r\n     was taken by him into a secret place, where, they two being\r\n     retired, the cardinal showed the carver a sum, prepared beforehand,\r\n     of 10,000 ducats, in gold, which the said cardinal persuaded the\r\n     carver to accept as a gift and to keep for love of him, and after\r\n     many words, they were at length accepted, the cardinal offering,\r\n     moreover, all the rest of his wealth at his command--for he was a\r\n     very rich cardinal, for he said that he could not keep the said\r\n     riches by any other means than through the said carver's aid, and\r\n     declared to him, 'You know of a certainty what the nature of the\r\n     pope is, and I know that he has resolved, with the Duke Valentinos,\r\n     to procure my life by poison, through your hand,'--wherefore he\r\n     besought the carver to take pity on him, and to give him his life.\r\n     And having said this, the carver declared to him the manner in\r\n     which it was ordered that the poison should be given to him at the\r\n     supper, but being moved to compassion he promised to preserve his\r\n     life. Now the orders were that the carver should present three\r\n     boxes of sweetmeats, in tablets or lozenges, after the supper, one\r\n     to the pope, one to the said cardinal, and another to the duke, and\r\n     in that for the cardinal there was poison: and thus being told, the\r\n     said cardinal gave directions to the aforesaid carver in what\r\n     manner he should serve them, so as to cause that the box of\r\n     poisoned confect which was to be for the cardinal, should be placed\r\n     before the pope, so that he might eat thereof, and so poison\r\n     himself, and die. And the pope being come accordingly with the duke\r\n     to supper on the day appointed, the cardinal threw himself at his\r\n     feet, kissing them and embracing them closely; then he entreated\r\n     his Holiness with most affectionate words, saying, he would never\r\n     rise from those feet until his Holiness had granted him a favour.\r\n     Being questioned by the pontiff what this favour was, and requested\r\n     to rise up, he would first have the grace he demanded, and the\r\n     promise of his Holiness to grant it. Now after much persuasion, the\r\n     pope remained sufficiently astonished, seeing the perseverance of\r\n     the cardinal, and that he would not rise, and promised to grant the\r\n     favour. Then the cardinal rose up and said, 'Holy Father, it is not\r\n     fitting that when the master comes to the house of his servant, the\r\n     servant should eat with his master like an equal (confrezer\r\n     parimente),' and therefore the grace he demanded was the just and\r\n     honest one, that he, the servant, should wait at the table of his\r\n     master; and this favour the pope granted him. Then having come to\r\n     supper, and the time for serving the confectionery having arrived,\r\n     the carver put the poisoned sweetmeats into the box, according to\r\n     the first order given to him by the pope, and the cardinal being\r\n     well informed as to which box had no poison, tasted of that one,\r\n     and put the poisoned confect before the pope. Then his Holiness,\r\n     trusting to his carver, and seeing the cardinal tasting, judged\r\n     that no poison was there, and ate of it heartily; while of the\r\n     other, which the pope thought was poisoned, but which was not, the\r\n     cardinal ate. Now at the hour accustomed, according to the quality\r\n     of that poison, his Holiness began to feel its effect, and so died\r\n     thereof; but the cardinal, who was yet much afraid, having\r\n     physicked himself and vomited, took no harm and escaped, though not\r\n     without difficulty.\"--_Sanuto_, iv., _Translation in Ranke's Hist.\r\n     of the Popes_.\r\n\r\nThe wine of the Vatican hill has had a bad reputation even from\r\nclassical times. \"If you like vinegar,\" wrote Martial, \"drink the wine\r\nof the Vatican!\"[376] and again, \"To drink the wine of the Vatican is to\r\ndrink poison.\"[377]\r\n\r\n(Here, also, is the entrance of the _Val d' Inferno_, a pleasant winter\r\nwalk, where, near the beginning of the Cork Woods, are some picturesque\r\nremains of an ancient nymphæum.)\r\n\r\nThe _Porta Angelica_, built by Pius IV. (1559--1566), leads into the\r\nBorgo, beneath the walls of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThose who return from hence to the English quarter in the evening, will\r\nrealize the vividness of Miss Thackeray's description:--\r\n\r\n     \"They passed groups standing round their doorways; a blacksmith\r\n     hammering with great straight blows at a copper pot, shouting to a\r\n     friend, a young baker, naked almost, except for a great sheet flung\r\n     over his shoulders, and leaning against the door of his shop. The\r\n     horses tramp on. Listen to the flow of fountains gleaming white\r\n     against the dark marbles,--to the murmur of voices. An old lady,\r\n     who has apparently hung all her wardrobe out of window, in\r\n     petticoats and silk hankerchiefs, is looking out from beneath these\r\n     banners at the passers in the streets. Little babies, tied up tight\r\n     in swaddling-clothes, are being poised against their mother's hips;\r\n     a child is trying to raise the great knocker of some feudal-looking\r\n     arch, hidden in the corner of the street. Then they cross the\r\n     bridge, and see the last sun's rays flaming from the angel's sacred\r\n     sword. Driving on through the tranquil streets, populous and\r\n     thronged with citizens, they see brown-faced, bronze-headed Torsos\r\n     in balconies and window-frames; citizens sitting tranquilly,\r\n     resting on the kerb-*stones, with their feet in the gutters;\r\n     grand-looking women resting against their doorways. Sibyls out of\r\n     the Sistine were sitting on the steps of the churches. In one stone\r\n     archway sat the Fates spinning their web. There was a holy family\r\n     by a lemonade-shop, and a whole heaven of little Coreggio angels\r\n     perching dark-eyed along the road. Then comes a fountain falling\r\n     into a marble basin, at either end of which two little girls are\r\n     clinging and climbing. Here is a little lighted May-altar to the\r\n     Virgin, which the children have put up under the shrine by the\r\n     street-corner. They don't beg clamorously, but stand leaning\r\n     against the wall, waiting for a chance miraculous\r\n     baioch?\"--_Bluebeard's Keys._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE JANICULAN.\r\n\r\n     Gate of Sto. Spirito--Church, Convent, and Garden of S.\r\n     Onofrio--The Lungara--Palazzo Salviati and the Botanic-Garden--S.\r\n     Giovanni alla Lungara--Palazzo Corsini--The Farnesina--Porta\r\n     Settimiana--S. Pietro in Montorio--Fontana Paolina--Villa\r\n     Lante--Porta and Church of S. Pancrazio--Villa\r\n     Doria-Pamfili--Chapel of St. Andrew's Head.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Janiculan is a steep crest of hill which rises abruptly on the west\r\nbank of the Tiber, and breaks imperceptibly away on the other side into\r\nthe Campagna towards Civita Vecchia. Its lower formation is a marine\r\nclay abounding in fossils, but its upper surface is formed of the yellow\r\nsand which gave it the ancient name of Mons Aureus,--still commemorated\r\nin Montorio--S. Pietro in Montorio.\r\n\r\nA tradition universally received in ancient times, and adopted by\r\nVirgil, derives the name of Janiculum from Janus, who was the sun-god,\r\nas Jana, or Diana, was the moon-goddess. On this hill Janus is believed\r\nto have founded a city, which is mentioned by Pliny under the name of\r\nAntinopolis. Ovid makes Janus speak for himself as to his property:\r\n\r\n    \"Arx mea collis erat, quem cultrix nomine nostro\r\n    Nuncupat hæc ætas, Janiculumque vocat.\"[378]\r\n\r\nFons, the supposed son of Janus, is known to have had an altar here in\r\nvery early times.[379] Janus Quirinus was a war-god, \"the sun armed\r\nwith a lance.\" Thus, in time of peace, the gates of this temple were\r\nclosed, both because his worship was then unnecessary, and from an idea\r\nof preventing war from going forth. It was probably in this character\r\nthat he was honoured on a site which the Romans looked upon as \"the key\r\nof Etruria,\" while other nations naturally regarded it as \"the key of\r\nRome.\"\r\n\r\nJanus was represented as having a key in his hand.\r\n\r\n     \"Ille tenens dextra baculum, clavemque sinistra.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Par un hasard singulier, Janus, qu'on représentait une clef à la\r\n     main, était le dieu du Janicule, voisin du Vatican, où est le\r\n     tombeau de Saint Pierre, que l'on représente aussi tenant une clef.\r\n     Janus, comme Saint Pierre, son futur voisin, était le portier\r\n     céleste.\"--_Ampère, Hist. Rom._ i. 229,\r\n\r\nWhen the first Sabine king of Rome, Numa Pompilius, \"like the darlings\r\nof the gods in the golden age, fell asleep, full of days,\"[380] he was\r\nburied upon the sacred hill of his own people, and the books of his\r\nsacred laws and ordinances were buried near him in a separate tomb.[381]\r\nIn the sixth century of the republic, a monument was discovered on the\r\nJaniculan, which was believed to be that of Numa, and certain books were\r\ndug up near it which were destroyed by the senate in the fear that they\r\nmight give a too free-*thinking explanation of the Roman mythology.[382]\r\n\r\nAncus Martius, the fourth king of Rome, connected the Janiculan with the\r\nrest of the city by building the Pons Sublicius, the first bridge over\r\nthe Tiber; and erected a citadel on the crest of the hill as a bulwark\r\nagainst Etruria, with which he was constantly at war.[383] Some\r\nescarpments, supposed to belong to the fortifications of Ancus, have\r\nlately been found behind the Fontana Paolina. It was from this same\r\nridge that his Etruscan successor, Tarquinius Priscus, coming from\r\nTarquinii (Corneto), had his first view of the city over which he came\r\nto reign, and here the eagle, henceforth to be the emblem of Roman\r\npower, replaced upon his head the cap which it had snatched away as he\r\nwas riding in his chariot. Hence, also, Lars Porsena, king of Etruria,\r\nlooked upon Rome, when he came to the assistance of Tarquinius Superbus,\r\nand retired in fear of his life after he had seen specimens of Roman\r\nendurance, in Horatius Cocles, who kept the falling bridge; in Mutius,\r\nwho burnt his hand in the charcoal; and in the hostage, Cœllia, who\r\nswam home across the Tiber,--all anecdotes connected with the Janiculan.\r\n\r\nAfter the time of the kings this hill appears less frequently in\r\nhistory. But it was here that the consul Octavius, the friend of Sylla,\r\nwas murdered by the partisans of Marius, while seated in his curule\r\nchair,--near the foot of the hill Julius Cæsar had his famous gardens,\r\nand on its summit the Emperor Galba was buried. The Christian\r\nassociations of the hill will be noticed at the different points to\r\nwhich they belong.\r\n\r\nFrom the Borgo (Chap. XV.) the unfinished gate called _Porta Sto.\r\nSpirito_, built by Antonio da San Gallo, leads into the Via Lungara, a\r\nstreet three-quarters of a mile long, formed by Sixtus V., and occupying\r\nthe whole length of the valley between the Tiber and the Janiculan.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the right, the steep \"Salita di S. Onofrio\" leads up the\r\nhillside to the _Church of S. Onofrio_, built in 1439 by Nicolo da Forca\r\nPalena, in honour of the Egyptian hermit, Honophrius.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Onofrius was a monk of Thebes, who retired to the desert, far\r\n     from the sight of men, and dwelt there in a cave for sixty years,\r\n     and during all that time never beheld one human being, or uttered\r\n     one word of his mother-tongue except in prayer. He was unclothed,\r\n     except by some leaves twisted round his body, and his beard and\r\n     hair had become like the face of a wild beast. In this state he was\r\n     discovered by a holy man whose name was Paphnutius, who, seeing him\r\n     crawling on the ground, knew not at first what live thing it might\r\n     be.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\nFrom the little platform in front of the convent is one of the loveliest\r\nviews over the city. The church is approached by a portico, decorated\r\nwith glazed frescoes by _Domenichino_. Those on either side of the door\r\nrepresent the saints of the Hieronomyte Order (the adjoining convent\r\nbelongs to Hieronomytes), viz.: S. Jerome, Sta. Paula, St. Eustochium,\r\nS. Pietro Gambacorta of Pisa, St Augustine the hermit, S. Nicolo di\r\nForca Palena, S. Onofrio and the Blessed Benedict of Sicily, Philip of\r\nSt. Agatha, Paul of Venice, Bartholomew of Cesarea, Mark of Manuta,\r\nPhilip of Fulgaria, and John of Catalonia. Over the door is a Madonna\r\nand Child. In the side arcade are three scenes in the life of St.\r\nJerome. 1. Represents his baptism as a young man at Rome. 2. Refers to\r\nhis vision of the Judgment (described in his letter to Eustochium), in\r\nwhich he heard the Judge of the World ask what he was, and he answered,\r\n\"I am a Christian.\" But the Judge replied, \"No, you lie, for you are a\r\nCiceronian,\" and he was condemned to be scourged, but continued to\r\nprotest that he was a Christian between every lash. 3. Is a scene\r\nalluded to in another letter to Eustochium, in which Jerome says, \"O how\r\noften when alone in the desert with the wild beasts and scorpions, half\r\ndead with fasting and penance, have I fancied myself a spectator of the\r\nsins of Rome, and of the dances of its young women.\"\r\n\r\nThe church has a solemn and picturesque interior. It ends in a tribune\r\nrichly adorned with frescoes, those of the upper part (the Coronation of\r\nthe Virgin, and eight groups of saints and angels) being by\r\n_Pinturicchio_, those of the lower (the Virgin and Saints, Nativity, and\r\nFlight into Egypt) by _Baldassare Peruzzi_.\r\n\r\nOn the left of the entrance is the original monument of Tasso (with a\r\nportrait), erected after his death by Cardinal Bevilacqua. Greatly\r\ninferior in interest is a monument recently placed to his memory in the\r\nadjoining chapel, by subscription, the work of _De Fabris_. Near this is\r\nthe grave of the poet, Alessandro Guidi, ob. 1712. In the third chapel\r\non the left is the grave of the learned Cardinal Mezzofanti, born at\r\nBologna, 1774, died at Rome, 1849.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel on the right, which is low and vaulted, with stumpy\r\npillars, is covered with frescoes relating to S. Onofrio.\r\n\r\nThe second chapel on the right, which is very richly decorated, contains\r\na Madonna crowned by Angels, by _Annibale Caracci_. Beyond this is the\r\nfine tomb of Archbishop Sacchi, ob. 1502. The beautiful lunette, of the\r\nMadonna teaching the Holy Child to read, is by _Pinturicchio_. The tomb\r\nis inscribed:\r\n\r\n    \"Labor et gloria vita fuit,\r\n      Mors requies.\"\r\n\r\nLadies are never admitted to visit the convent, except on April 25th,\r\nthe anniversary of the death of Tasso. It is approached by a cloister,\r\ndecorated with frescoes from the life of S. Onofrio.\r\n\r\n     \"S. Onofrio is represented as a meagre old man, with long hair and\r\n     beard, grey and matted, a leafy branch twisted round his loins, a\r\n     stick in his hand. The artist generally tries to make him look as\r\n     haggard and inhuman as possible.\"--_Mrs. Jameson._\r\n\r\nIn a passage on the first floor is a beautiful fresco of the Virgin and\r\nChild with the donor, by _Leonardo da Vinci_.\r\n\r\n     \"To 1513 belongs a Madonna, painted on the wall of the upper\r\n     corridor of the convent of S. Onofrio. It is on a gold ground: the\r\n     action of the Madonna is beautiful, displaying the noblest form,\r\n     and the expression of the countenance is peculiarly sweet; but the\r\n     Child, notwithstanding his graceful action, is somewhat hard and\r\n     heavy, so as almost to warrant the conclusion that this picture\r\n     belongs to an earlier period, which would suppose a previous visit\r\n     to Rome.\"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nTorquato Tasso came to Rome in 1594, on the invitation of Clement VIII.,\r\nthat he might be crowned on the Capitol, but as he arrived in the month\r\nof November, and the weather was then very bad, it was decided to\r\npostpone the ceremony till late in the following spring. This delay was\r\na source of trouble to Tasso, who was in feeble health, and had a\r\npresentiment that his death was near. Before the time for his crowning\r\narrived he had removed to S. Onofrio, saying to the monks who received\r\nhim at the entrance, \"My fathers, I have come to die amongst you!\" and\r\nhe wrote to one of his friends, \"I am come to begin my conversation in\r\nheaven in this elevated place, and in the society of these holy\r\nfathers.\" During the fourteen days of his illness, he became perfectly\r\nabsorbed in the contemplation of divine subjects, and upon the last day\r\nof his life, when he received the papal absolution, exclaimed, \"I\r\nbelieve that the crown which I looked for upon the Capitol is to be\r\nchanged for a better crown in heaven.\" Throughout the last night a monk\r\nprayed by his side till the morning, when Tasso was heard to murmur, \"In\r\nmanus tuas, Domine,\" and then he died. The room in which he expired,\r\nApril 25, 1595, contains his bust, crucifix, inkstand, autograph, a mask\r\ntaken from his face after death, and other relics. The archives of S.\r\nOnofrio have this entry:\r\n\r\n     \"Torquato Tasso, illustrious from his genius, died thus in our\r\n     monastery of S. Onofrio. In April, 1595, he caused himself to be\r\n     brought here that he might prepare for death with greater devotion\r\n     and security, as he felt his end approaching. He was received\r\n     courteously by our fathers, and conducted to chambers in the\r\n     loggia, where everything was ready for him. Soon afterwards he\r\n     became dangerously ill, and desired to confess and receive the most\r\n     Holy Sacrament from the prior. Being asked to write his will, he\r\n     said that he wished to be buried at S. Onofrio, and he left to the\r\n     convent his crucifix and fifty scudi for alms, that so many masses\r\n     might be said for his soul, in the manner that is read in the book\r\n     of legacies in our archives. Pope Clement VIII. was requested for\r\n     his benediction, which he gave amply for the remission of sins. In\r\n     his last days he received extreme unction, and then, with the\r\n     crucifix in his hand, contemplating and kissing the sacred image,\r\n     with Christian contrition and devotion, being surrounded by our\r\n     fathers, he gave up his spirit to the Creator, on April 25, 1595,\r\n     between the eleventh and twelfth hours (_i.e._, between 7 and 8\r\n     A.M.), in the fiftieth year of his age. In the evening his body was\r\n     interred with universal concourse in our church, near the steps of\r\n     the high altar, the Cardinal Giulio Aldobrandini, under whose\r\n     protection he had lived during the last years, being minded to\r\n     erect to him, as soon as possible, a sumptuous sepulchre; which,\r\n     however, was never carried into effect; but after the death of the\r\n     latter, the Signor Cardinal Bevilacqua raised to his memory the\r\n     monument which is seen on entering the church on the left side.\"\r\n\r\nLadies are admitted to the beautiful garden of the convent on ringing at\r\nthe first large gate on the left below the church.\r\n\r\nThis lovely plot of ground, fresh with running streams, possesses a\r\nglorious view over the city, and the Campagna beyond S. Paolo. At the\r\nfurther extremity, near a picturesque group of cypresses, are remains of\r\nthe oak planted by Tasso, the greater part of which was blown down in\r\n1842. A young sapling is shooting up beside it. Beyond this is the\r\nlittle amphitheatre, overgrown with grass and flowers, where S. Filippo\r\nNeri used to teach children, and assemble them \"for the half-dramatic\r\nmusical performances which were an original form of his oratorios. Here\r\nevery 25th of April a musical entertainment of the Accademia is held in\r\nmemory of Tasso,--his bust, crowned with laurel wreaths, and taken from\r\nthe cast after death, being placed in the centre of the\r\namphitheatre.\"[384]\r\n\r\nReturning to the Lungara, on the left is a Lunatic Asylum, founded by\r\nPius IX., with a pompous inscription, and beyond it, a chain bridge to\r\nS. Giovanni dei Fiorentini. On the right is the handsome _Palazzo\r\nSalviati_, which formerly contained a fine collection of pictures,\r\nremoved to the Borghese Palace, when, upon the property falling into the\r\nhands of Prince Borghese, he sold the palace to the government, who now\r\nuse it as a repository for the civil archives. The adjoining garden now\r\nbelongs to the Sapienza, and has been turned into a _Botanic Garden_.\r\nThe modernized church of S. _Giovanni alla Lungara_ dates from the time\r\nof Leo IV. (845--857), and is now attached to a reformatory. On the\r\nright is a large _Convent of the Buon Pastore_.\r\n\r\nWe now reach, on the right, the magnificent _Palazzo Corsini_, built\r\noriginally by the Riario family, from whom it was bought by Clement XII.\r\nin 1729, for his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, for whom it was altered\r\nto its present form by _Fuga_.\r\n\r\nThis palace was in turn the resort of Caterina Sforza, the brave duchess\r\nof Imola; of the learned Poet Cardinal di S. Giorgio; of Michael Angelo,\r\nwho remained here more than a year on a visit to the cardinal, \"who,\"\r\nsays Vasari, \"being of small understanding in art, gave him no\r\ncommission\"; and of Erasmus, who always remembered the pleasant\r\nconversations (confabulationes mellifluæ) of the \"Riario Palace,\" as it\r\nwas then called. In the seventeenth century the palace became the\r\nresidence of Queen Christina of Sweden, who died here on April 19, 1689,\r\nin a room which is distinguished by two columns of painted wood.\r\n\r\n     \"With her residence in Rome, the habits of Christina became more\r\n     tranquil and better regulated. She obtained some mastery over\r\n     herself, suffered certain considerations of what was due to others\r\n     to prevail, and consented to acknowledge the necessities incident\r\n     to the peculiarities of her chosen residence. She took a constantly\r\n     increasing part in the splendour, the life, and the business of the\r\n     Curia, becoming indeed eventually altogether identified with its\r\n     interests. The collections she had brought with her from Sweden,\r\n     she now enlarged by so liberal an expenditure, and with so much\r\n     taste, judgment, and success, that she surpassed even the native\r\n     families, and elevated the pursuit from a mere gratification of\r\n     curiosity, to a higher and more significant importance both for\r\n     learning and art. Men such as Spanheim and Havercamp thought the\r\n     illustration of her coins and medals an object not unworthy of\r\n     their labours, and Sante Bartolo devoted his practised hand to her\r\n     cameos. The Coreggios of Christina's collection have always been\r\n     the richest ornament of every gallery into which the changes of\r\n     time have carried them. The MSS. of her choice have contributed in\r\n     no small degree to maintain the reputation of the Vatican library,\r\n     into which they were subsequently incorporated. Acquisitions and\r\n     possessions of this kind filled up the hours of her daily life,\r\n     with an enjoyment that was at least harmless. She also took\r\n     interest and an active part in scientific pursuits; and it is much\r\n     to her credit that she received the poor exiled Borelli, who was\r\n     compelled to resort in his old age to teaching as a means of\r\n     subsistence. The queen supported him with her utmost power, and\r\n     caused his renowned and still unsurpassed work, on the mechanics of\r\n     animal motion, by which physiological science has been so\r\n     importantly influenced and advanced, to be printed at her own cost.\r\n     Nay, I think we may even venture to affirm, that she herself, when\r\n     her character and intellect had been improved and matured, exerted\r\n     a powerfully efficient and enduring influence on the period, more\r\n     particularly on Italian literature. In the year 1680, she founded\r\n     an academy in her own residence for the discussion of literary and\r\n     political subjects; and the first rule of this institution was,\r\n     that its members should carefully abstain from the turgid style,\r\n     overloaded with false ornament, which prevailed at the time, and be\r\n     guided only by sound sense and the models of the Augustan and\r\n     Medicean ages. From the queen's academy proceeded such men as\r\n     Alessandro Guidi, who had previously been addicted to the style\r\n     then used, but after some time passed in the society of Christina,\r\n     he not only resolved to abandon it, but even formed a league with\r\n     some of his friends for the purpose of labouring to abolish it\r\n     altogether. The Arcadia, an academy to which the merit of\r\n     completing this good work is attributed, arose out of the society\r\n     which assembled around the Swedish queen. On the whole, it must\r\n     needs be admitted, that in the midst of the various influences\r\n     pressing around her, Christina preserved a noble independence of\r\n     mind. To the necessity for evincing that ostentatious piety usually\r\n     expected from converts, or which they impose on themselves, she\r\n     would by no means subject herself. Entirely Catholic as she was,\r\n     and though continually repeating her conviction of the pope's\r\n     infallibility, and of the necessity for believing all doctrines\r\n     enjoined either by himself or the Church, she had nevertheless an\r\n     extreme detestation of bigots, and utterly abhorred the direction\r\n     of father confessors, who were at that time the exclusive rulers of\r\n     all social and domestic life. She would not be prevented from\r\n     enjoying the amusements of the carnival, concerts, dramatic\r\n     entertainments, or whatever else might be offered by the habits of\r\n     life at Rome; above all, she refused to be withheld from the\r\n     internal movement of an intellectual and animated society. She\r\n     acknowledged a love of satires, and took pleasure in Pasquin. We\r\n     find her constantly mingled in the intrigues of the court, the\r\n     dissensions of the papal houses, and the factions of the\r\n     cardinals.... She attached herself to the mode of life presented to\r\n     her with a passionate love, and even thought it impossible to live\r\n     if she did not breathe the atmosphere of Rome.\"--_Ranke's Hist. of\r\n     the Popes._\r\n\r\nIn 1797 this palace was used as the French embassy, and on the 28th of\r\nDecember was the scene of a terrible skirmish, when Joseph Buonaparte,\r\nthen ambassador, attempted to interfere between the French democratic\r\nparty and the papal dragoons, and when young General Duphot, who was\r\nabout to be married to Buonaparte's sister-in-law, was shot by his side\r\nin a balcony. These events, after which Joseph Buonaparte immediately\r\ndemanded his passports and departed, were among the chief causes which\r\nled to the invasion of Rome by Berthier, and the imprisonment of Pius\r\nVII.[385]\r\n\r\nThe collections now in the palace have all been formed since the death\r\nof Queen Christina. The _Picture Gallery_ is open to the public from\r\nnine to twelve, every day except Sundays and holidays.\r\n\r\nThe following criticism, applicable to all the private galleries in\r\nRome, is perhaps especially so to this:\r\n\r\n     \"You may generally form a tolerably correct conjecture of what a\r\n     gallery will contain, as to subject, before you enter it,--a\r\n     certain quantity of Landscapes, a great many Holy Families, a few\r\n     Crucifixions, two or three Pietàs, a reasonable proportion of St.\r\n     Jeromes, a mixture of other Saints and Martyrdoms, and a large\r\n     assortment of Madonnas and Magdalenes, make up the principal part\r\n     of all the collections in Rome; which are generally comprised of\r\n     quite as many bad as good paintings.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     The 1st room is chiefly occupied by pretty but unimportant\r\n     landscapes by _Orizzonti_ and _Vanvitelli_, and figure pieces by\r\n     Locatelli.

It has also some beautiful original drawings by the old\r\nmasters. Behind the palace, on the slope of the Janiculan, are large and\r\nbeautiful _Gardens_ adorned with fountains, cypresses, and some grand\r\nold plane-trees. There is a fine view from the Casino on the summit of\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\n     \"A magnificent porter in cocked hat and grand livery conducted the\r\n     visitors across the quadrangle, unlocked the ponderous iron gates\r\n     of the gardens, and let them through, leaving them to their own\r\n     devices, and closing and locking the gates with a crash. They now\r\n     stood in a wide avenue of ilex, whose gloomy boughs, interlacing\r\n     overhead, effectually excluded the sunlight; nearly a quarter of a\r\n     mile further on, the ilexes were replaced by box and bay trees,\r\n     beneath which the sun and shade divided the path between them,\r\n     trembling and flickering on the ground and invading each other's\r\n     dominions with every breath of wind. The strangers heard the splash\r\n     of fountains as they walked onwards by banks precipitous as a\r\n     hill-side, and covered with wild rank herbage and tall trees.\r\n     Stooping to gather a flower, they almost started, as looking up,\r\n     they saw, rising against a sky fabulously blue, the unfamiliar\r\n     green ilex and dark cypress spire.\"--_Mademoiselle Mori_.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Corsini Palace is the beautiful villa of _the Farnesina_\r\n(open on Sundays from 10 to 3), built in 1506 by Baldassare Peruzzi for\r\nthe famous banker Agostino Chigi, who here gave his sumptuous and\r\nextravagant entertainments to Leo X. and his court--banquets at which\r\nthree fish cost as much as 230 crowns, and after which the plate that\r\nhad been used, was all thrown into the Tiber.[386] This same Agostino\r\nChigi was one of the greatest of art patrons, and has handed down to us\r\nnot only the decorations of the Farnesina, but the Sibyls of Sta. Maria\r\ndella Pace, which he also ordered from Raphael.\r\n\r\n     \"Le jour où Leon X. alla prendre possession de la basilique de\r\n     Latran, l'opulent Chigi se distingua. Le théâtre qui s'élevait\r\n     devant son palais était rempli des envoyés de tous les peuples,\r\n     blancs, cuivrés, et noirs; au milieu d'eux on distinguait les\r\n     images de Vénus, de Mars, de Minerve, allusion singulière aux trois\r\n     pontificats d'Alexander VI., de Jules II, et de Léon X. _Vénus a eu\r\n     son temps_: disait l'inscription; _Mars a eu le sien; c'est\r\n     aujourd'hui le règne de Minerve_. Antoine de San-Marino, qui\r\n     demeurait près de Chigi, répondit aussitot en plaçant sur sa\r\n     boutique la statue isolée de Vénus, avec ce peu de mots: Mars a\r\n     régné, Minerve règne, Vénus régnera toujours.\"--_Gournerie, Rome\r\n     Chrétienne_, ii. 109.\r\n\r\nThe Farnesina contains some of the most beautiful existing frescoes of\r\nRaphael and his school. The principal hall was once open, but has now\r\nbeen closed in to preserve the paintings. Its ceiling was designed by\r\n_Raphael_ (1518--20), and painted by _Giulio Romano_ and _Francesco\r\nPenni_, with twelve scenes from the story of Psyche as narrated by\r\nApuleius:\r\n\r\n     A king had three daughters. The youngest was named Psyche, and was\r\n     more lovely than the sunshine. Venus, the queen of beauty, was\r\n     herself jealous of her, and bade her son Cupid to destroy her\r\n     charms by inspiring her with an unworthy love (1). But Cupid, when\r\n     he beheld Psyche, loved her himself, showed her to the Graces (2),\r\n     and carried her off. He only visited her in the darkness of night,\r\n     and bade her always to repress her curiosity as to his appearance.\r\n     But while Cupid was sleeping, Psyche lighted a lamp, and looked\r\n     upon him,--and a drop of the hot oil fell upon him and he awoke.\r\n     Then he left her alone in grief and solitude. Venus in the mean\r\n     time learnt that Cupid was faithless to her, and imprisoned him,\r\n     and sought assistance from Juno and Ceres that she might find\r\n     Psyche, but they refused to aid her (3). Then she drove to seek\r\n     Jupiter in her chariot drawn by doves (4), and implored him to send\r\n     Mercury to her assistance (5). Jupiter listened to her prayer, and\r\n     Mercury was sent forth to seek for Psyche (6). Venus then showed\r\n     her spite against Psyche, and imposed harsh tasks upon her which\r\n     she was nevertheless enabled to perform. At length she was ordered\r\n     to bring a casket from the infernal regions (7), and even this, to\r\n     the amazement of Venus, she succeeded in effecting (8). Cupid,\r\n     escaped from captivity, then implored Jupiter to restore Psyche to\r\n     him. Jupiter embraced him (9), and bade Mercury summon the gods to\r\n     a council on the subject (see the ceiling on the right). Psyche was\r\n     then brought to Olympus (10), and became immortal, and the gods\r\n     celebrated her nuptial banquet (ceiling painting on left).\r\n\r\n     \"On the flat of the ceiling are two large compositions, with\r\n     numerous figures,--the Judgment of the Gods, who decide the dispute\r\n     between Venus and Cupid, and the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche in\r\n     the festal assembly of the gods. In the lunettes of the ceiling are\r\n     _amorini_, with the attributes of those gods who have done homage\r\n     to the power of Love. In the triangular compartments between the\r\n     lunettes are different groups, illustrative of the incidents in the\r\n     fable. They are of great beauty, and are examples of the most\r\n     tasteful disposition in a given space. The picture of the three\r\n     Graces, that in which Cupid stands in an imploring attitude before\r\n     Jupiter; a third, where Psyche is borne away by Loves, are\r\n     extremely graceful. Peevish critics have designated these\r\n     representations as common and sensual, but the noble spirit visible\r\n     in all Raphael's works prevails also in these: religious feeling\r\n     could naturally find no place in them; but they are conceived in a\r\n     spirit of the purest artlessness, always a proof of true moral\r\n     feeling, and to which a narrow taste alone could object. In the\r\n     execution, indeed, we recognise little of Raphael's fine feeling;\r\n     the greatest part is by his scholars, after his cartoons,\r\n     especially by G. Romano. The nearest of the three Graces, in the\r\n     group before alluded to, appears to be by Raphael's own\r\n     hand.\"--_Kugler_.\r\n\r\nThe paintings were injuriously retouched by _Carlo Maratta_. The\r\ngarlands round them are by _Giovanni da Udine_. The second room contains\r\nthe beautiful fresco of Galatea floating in a shell drawn by dolphins,\r\nby _Raphael_ himself.\r\n\r\n     \"Raphael not only designed, but executed this fresco; and faded as\r\n     is its colouring, the mind must be dead to the highest beauties of\r\n     painting, that can contemplate it without admiration. The spirit\r\n     and beauty of the composition, the pure and perfect design, the\r\n     flowing outline, the soft and graceful contours, and the sentiment\r\n     and sweetness of the expression, all remain unchanged; for time,\r\n     till it totally obliterates, has no power to injure them.... The\r\n     figures of the attendant Nereid, and of the triumphant Triton who\r\n     embraces her, are beautiful beyond description.\"--_Eaton's Rome._\r\n\r\n     \"The fresco of Galatea was painted in 1514. The greater part of\r\n     this is Raphael's own work, and the execution is consequently much\r\n     superior to that of the others. It represents the goddess of the\r\n     sea borne over the waves in her shell; tritons and sea-nymphs sport\r\n     joyously around her; _amorini_, discharging their arrows, appear in\r\n     the air like an angel-glory. The utmost sweetness, the most ardent\r\n     sense of pleasure, breathe from this work; everything lives, feels,\r\n     vibrates with enjoyment \"--_Kugler._\r\n\r\nThe frescoes of the ceiling, representing Diana in her Car, and the\r\nstory of Medusa, are by _Baldassare Peruzzi_; the lunettes are by\r\n_Sebastian del Piombo_ and _Daniele da Volterra_. Michael Angelo came\r\none day to visit the latter, and not finding him at his work, left the\r\ncolossal head, which remains in a lunette of the left wall, as a sign of\r\nhis visit.\r\n\r\nIn the upper story are two rooms; the first, adorned with a frieze of\r\nsubjects from Ovid's Metamorphoses, contains large architectural\r\npaintings by _Baldassare Peruzzi_; the second has the Marriage of\r\nAlexander and Roxana, and the family of Darius in the presence of\r\nAlexander, by _Sodoma_.\r\n\r\nThe _Porta Settimiana_ at the end of the Lungara preserves in its name a\r\nrecollection of the gardens of Septimius Severus, which existed in this\r\nquarter. From hence the Via delle Fornaci ascends the hill, and leads to\r\nthe broad new carriage-road, formed in 1867 under the superintendence\r\nof the Cav. Trochi. A Via-Crucis with a staircase will conduct the\r\npedestrian by a shorter way to the platform on the hill-top.\r\n\r\nThe succession of beggars who infest this hill and stretch out their\r\nmaimed limbs or kiss their hands to the passers-by will call to mind the\r\nlines of Juvenal:\r\n\r\n    \"Cæcus adulator, dirusque a ponte satelles,\r\n    Dignus Aricinos qui mendicaret ad axes,\r\n    Blandaque devexæ jactaret basia rhedæ.\"\r\n\r\n    _Sat._ iv. 116.\r\n\r\n_The Church of S. Pietro in Montorio_ was built by Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella of Spain, from designs of Baccio Pintelli, on the site of an\r\noratory founded by Constantine upon the supposed spot of St. Peter's\r\ncrucifixion.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel on the right belongs to the Barberini, and contains\r\npictures by _Sebastian del Piombo_, (painted in oil upon stone, a\r\nprocess which has caused them to be much blackened by time,) from\r\ndrawings of _Michael Angelo_. The central picture represents the\r\nScourging of Christ, a subject of which Sebastian was especially fond,\r\nas it gave the opportunity of displaying his great anatomical power. On\r\nthe left is St. Peter, on the right St. Francis,--on the ceiling is the\r\nTransfiguration,--outside the arch are a Prophet and a Sibyl. The second\r\nchapel on the right has paintings by pupils of Perugino; the fifth\r\ncontains St. Paul healed by Ananias, by _Vasari_.\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapel on the right is of some interest in the history of\r\nart. Julius III. had it greatly at heart to build and beautify this\r\nchapel as a memorial to his family, to contain the tombs of his uncle\r\nCardinal Antonio di Monti, and of Fabiano, who first founded the\r\nsplendours of his house. The work was entrusted to Michael Angelo and\r\nVasari, who were at that time on terms of intimate friendship. They\r\ndisputed about their subordinates. Vasari wished to employ Simone Mosca\r\nfor the ornaments, and Raffaello da Montalupo for the statues; Michael\r\nAngelo objected to having any ornamental work at all, saying that where\r\nthere were to be marble figures, there ought to be nothing else, and he\r\nwould have nothing to do with Montalupo because his figures for the tomb\r\nof Julius II. had turned out so ill. When the chapel was finished\r\nMichael Angelo confessed himself in the wrong for not having allowed\r\nmore ornament. The statues were entrusted to Bartolomeo Ammanati.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel on the left has St. Francis receiving the stigmata\r\nattributed to _Giovanni de Vecchi_.\r\n\r\n     \"A barber of the Cardinal S. Giorgio was an artist, who painted\r\n     very well in tempera, but had no idea of design. He made friends\r\n     with Michael-Angelo, who made him a cartoon of a St. Francis\r\n     receiving the stigmata, which the barber carefully carried out in\r\n     colour, and his picture is now placed in the first chapel on the\r\n     left of the entrance of S. Pietro in Montorio.\"--_Vasari_, vi.\r\n\r\nThe third chapel on the left contains a Virgin and Child with St. Anne,\r\nof the school of Perugino; the fourth, a fine Entombment, by an unknown\r\nhand; the fifth, the Baptism of Christ, said to be by _Daniele da\r\nVolterra_.\r\n\r\nThe Transfiguration of Raphael was painted for this church, and remained\r\nhere till the French invasion. When it was returned from the Louvre it\r\nwas kept at the Vatican. Had it been restored to this church, it would\r\nhave been destroyed in the siege of 1849, when the tribune and\r\nbell-tower were thrown down. Here, in front of the high altar, the\r\nunhappy Beatrice Cenci was buried without any monument.\r\n\r\nIrish travellers may be interested in the gravestones in the nave, of\r\nHugh O'Neil of Tyrone, Baron Dungannon, and O'Donnell of Tyrconnell\r\n(1608). Near the door is the fine tomb, with the beautiful sleeping\r\nfigure of Julian, Archbishop of Ragusa, ob. 1510, inscribed \"Bonis et\r\nMors et Vita dulcis est.\" An inscription below the steps in front of the\r\nchurch commemorates the translation of a miraculous image of the Virgin\r\nhither in 1714.\r\n\r\nIn the cloister is the _Tempietto_, a small domed building resting on\r\nsixteen Doric columns, built by Bramante in 1502, on the spot where St.\r\nPeter's cross is said to have stood. A few grains of the sacred sand\r\nfrom the hole in the centre of the chapel are given to visitors by the\r\nmonks as a relic.\r\n\r\n     \"St. Peter, when he was come to the place of execution, requested\r\n     of the officers that he might be crucified with his head downwards,\r\n     alleging that he was not worthy to suffer in the same manner his\r\n     divine Master had died before him. He had preached the cross of\r\n     Christ, had borne it in his heart, and its marks in his body, by\r\n     sufferings and mortification, and he had the happiness to end his\r\n     life on the cross. The Lord was pleased not only that he should die\r\n     for his love, but in the same manner himself had died for us, by\r\n     expiring on the cross, which was the throne of his love. Only the\r\n     apostle's humility made a difference, in desiring to be crucified\r\n     with his head downward. His Master looked toward heaven, which by\r\n     his death he opened to men; but he judged that a sinner formed from\r\n     dust, and going to return to dust, ought rather in confusion to\r\n     look on the earth, as unworthy to raise his eyes to heaven. St.\r\n     Ambrose, St. Austin, and St. Prudentius ascribe this his petition\r\n     partly to his humility, and partly to his desire of suffering more\r\n     for Christ. Seneca mentions that the Romans sometimes crucified men\r\n     with their heads downward; and Eusebius testifies that several\r\n     martyrs were put to that cruel death. Accordingly, the executioners\r\n     easily granted the apostle his extraordinary request. St.\r\n     Chrysostom, St. Austin, and St. Austerius say that he was nailed to\r\n     the cross; Tertullian mentions that he was tied with cords. He was\r\n     probably both nailed and bound with ropes.\"--_Alban Butler._\r\n\r\nThe view from the front of the church is almost unrivalled.\r\n\r\nBehind it is the famous _Fontana Paolina_, whose name, by a curious\r\ncoincidence, combines those of its architect, Fontana, and its\r\noriginator, Paul V. It was erected in 1611, and is supplied with water\r\nfrom the Lake of Bracciano, by the aqueduct of the Aqua Trajana,\r\nthirty-five miles in length. The red granite columns, which divide the\r\nfountain, were brought from the temple of Minerva in the Forum\r\nTransitorium.\r\n\r\n     \"The pleasant, natural sound of falling water, not unlike that of a\r\n     distant cascade in the forest, may be heard in many of the Roman\r\n     streets and piazzas, when the tumult of the city is hushed; for\r\n     consuls, emperors, and popes, the great men of every age, have\r\n     found no better way of immortalising their memories, than by the\r\n     shifting, indestructible, ever new, yet unchanging, up-gush and\r\n     down-fall of water. They have written their names in that unstable\r\n     element, and proved it a more durable record than brass or\r\n     marble.\"--_Hawthorne._\r\n\r\n     \"Il n'y a rien encore, dans quelque état que ce soit, à opposer aux\r\n     magnifiques fontaines qu'on voit à Rome dans les places et les\r\n     carrefours, ni à l'abondance des eaux qui ne cessent jamais de\r\n     couler; magnificence d'autant plus louable que l'utilité publique y\r\n     est jointe.\"--_Duclos._\r\n\r\nA little beyond this fountain is the modern _Porta S. Pancrazio_, near\r\nthe site of the ancient Porta Aurelia, built by Pius IX. in 1857, to\r\nreplace a gate destroyed by the French under Oudinot in 1849. Many\r\nbuildings outside the gate, injured at the same time, still remain in\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nThe lane on the right, inside the gate, leads to the _Villa Lante_,\r\nbuilt in 1524 by Giulio Romano, for Bartolomeo da Pescia, secretary of\r\nClement VII. It still contains some frescoes of Giulio Romano, though\r\nthey are only lately uncovered, as the house was used, until the last\r\ntwo years, as a succursale to the Convent of the Sacré Cœur at the\r\nTrinità de' Monti.\r\n\r\nNot far outside the gate are the _Church and Convent of S. Pancrazio_,\r\nfounded in the sixth century by Pope Symmachus, but modernized in 1609\r\nby Cardinal Torres. Here Crescenzio Nomentano, the famous consul of Rome\r\nin the tenth century, is buried; here Narses, after the defeat of\r\nTotila, was met by the pope and cardinals, and conducted in triumph to\r\nSt. Peter's to return thanks for his victory; here, also, Peter II. of\r\nArragon was crowned by Innocent III., and Louis of Naples was received\r\nby John XII.\r\n\r\nA flight of steps leads from the church to the _Catacomb of Calepodius_,\r\nwhere many of the early popes and martyrs were buried. It has no\r\nespecial characteristic to make it worth visiting. Another flight of\r\nsteps leads to the spot where S. Pancrazio was martyred. His body rests\r\nwith that of St. Victor beneath the altar. A parish church in London is\r\ndedicated to St. Pancras, in whose name kings of France used to confirm\r\ntheir treaties.\r\n\r\n     \"In the persecution under Diocletian, this young saint, who was\r\n     only fourteen years of age, offered himself voluntarily as a\r\n     martyr, defending boldly before the emperor the cause of the\r\n     Christians. He was therefore beheaded by the sword, and his body\r\n     was honourably buried by Christian women. His church, near the gate\r\n     of S. Pancrazio, has existed since the year 500. St. Pancras was in\r\n     the middle ages regarded as the protector against false oaths, and\r\n     the avenger of perjury. It was believed that those who swore\r\n     falsely by St. Pancras were immediately and visibly punished; hence\r\n     his popularity.\"--_Jameson's Sacred Art._\r\n\r\nTurning to the left from the gate, on the side of the hill between this\r\nand the Porta Portese, is the _Catacomb of S. Ponziano_.\r\n\r\n     \"Here is the only perfect specimen still extant of a primitive\r\n     subterranean baptistery. A small stream of water runs through this\r\n     cemetery, and at this one place the channel has been deepened so as\r\n     to form a kind of reservoir, in which a certain quantity of water\r\n     is retained. We descend into it by a flight of steps, and the depth\r\n     of water it contains varies with the height of the Tiber. When that\r\n     river is swollen so as to block up the exit by which this stream\r\n     usually empties itself, the waters are sometimes so dammed back as\r\n     to inundate the adjacent galleries of the catacomb; at other times\r\n     there are not above three or four feet of water. At the back of\r\n     the font, and springing out of the water, is painted a beautiful\r\n     Latin cross, from whose sides leaves and flowers are budding forth,\r\n     and on the two arms rest ten candlesticks, with the letters Alpha\r\n     and Omega suspended by a little chain below them. On the front of\r\n     the arch over the font is the Baptism of our Lord in the river\r\n     Jordan by St. John, whilst St. Abdon, St. Sennen, St. Miles, and\r\n     other saints of the Oriental Church occupy the sides. These\r\n     paintings are all of late date, perhaps of the seventh or eighth\r\n     century: but there is no reason to doubt but that the baptistery\r\n     had been so used from the earliest times. We have distinct evidence\r\n     in the Acts of the Martyrs that the sacrament was not unfrequently\r\n     administered in the cemeteries.\"--_The Roman Catacombs--Northcote._\r\n\r\nIn this catacomb is an early _Portrait of Christ_, much resembling that\r\nat SS. Nereo ed Achilleo.\r\n\r\n     \"The figure is, however, draped, and the whole work has certain\r\n     peculiarities which appear to mark a later period of art. Both\r\n     these portraits agree, if not strictly, yet in general features,\r\n     with the description in Lentulus's letter (to the Roman senate),\r\n     and portraits and descriptions together serve to prove that the\r\n     earliest Christian delineators of the person of the Saviour\r\n     followed no arbitrary conception of their own, but were guided\r\n     rather by a particular traditional type, differing materially from\r\n     the Grecian ideal, and which they transmitted in a great measure to\r\n     future ages.\"--_Kugler_, i. 16.\r\n\r\nIn this vicinity are the Catacombs of SS. Abdon and Sennen, of St.\r\nJulius, and of Sta. Generosa.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Porta S. Pancrazio is the entrance of the beautiful _Villa\r\nPamfili Doria_ (open to pedestrians and to _two-horse_ carriages after\r\n12 o'clock on Mondays and Fridays), called by the Italians \"Belrespiro.\"\r\nThe _Casino_ contains a few (not first-rate) ancient statues, and some\r\nviews of Venice in the seventeenth century by _Heintius_. The garden,\r\nfor which especial permission must be obtained, is full of beautiful\r\nazaleas and camellias.\r\n\r\nFrom the ilex-fringed terrace in front of the casino is one of the best\r\nviews of St. Peter's, which is here seen without the town,--backed by\r\nthe Campagna, the Sabine Mountains, and the blue peak of Soracte. The\r\nroad to the left leads through pine-shaded lawns and woods, and by some\r\nmodern ruins, to the lake, above which is a graceful fountain. A small\r\ntemple raised in 1851 commemorates the French who fell here during the\r\nsiege of Rome in 1849. The word \"Mary\" in large letters of clipped box\r\non the other side of the grounds is a memorial of the late beloved\r\nPrincess Doria (Lady Mary Talbot). Not far from this is a columbarium.\r\n\r\nThe site of the Villa Doria was once occupied by the gardens of Galba,\r\nand here the murdered emperor is believed to have been buried.\r\n\r\n     \"Un certain Argius, autrefois esclave de Galba, ramassa son corps,\r\n     qui avait subi mille outrages, et alla lui creuser une humble\r\n     sépulture dans les jardins de son ancien maître; mais il fallut\r\n     retrouver la tête: elle avait été mutilée et promenée par les\r\n     goujats de l'armée. Enfin Argius la trouva le lendemain, et la\r\n     réunit au corps déjà brûlé. Les jardins de Galba étaient sur le\r\n     Janicule, près de la voie Aurélienne, et on croit que le lieu qui\r\n     vit le dernier dénouement de cette affreuse tragédie est celui\r\n     qu'occupe aujourd'hui la plus charmante promenade de Rome, là où\r\n     inclinent avec tant de grâce sur les pentes semées d'anémones et où\r\n     dessinent si délicatement sur l'azur du ciel et des montagnes leurs\r\n     parasols élégants les pins de la villa Pamphili.\"--_Ampère, Emp._\r\n     ii. 80.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Villa Pamfili Doria is due to the wealth extorted\r\nby Olympia Maldacchini during the reign of her brother-in-law, Innocent\r\nX.\r\n\r\n     \"Innocent X. fut, pour ainsi dire, contraint de fonder la maison\r\n     Pamphili. Les casuistes et les jurisconsultes levèrent ses\r\n     scrupules, car il en avait. Ils lui prouvèrent que le pape était en\r\n     droit d'économiser sur les revenus du saint-siége pour assurer\r\n     l'avenir de sa famille. Ils fixèrent, avec une modération qui nous\r\n     fait dresser les cheveux sur la tête, le chiffre des libéralités\r\n     permises à chaque pape. Suivant eux, le souverain pontife pouvait,\r\n     sans abuser, établir un majorat de quatre mille francs de rente\r\n     nette, fonder une seconde géniture en faveur de quelque parent\r\n     moins avantagé, et donner neuf cent mille francs de dot à chacune\r\n     de ses nièces. Le général des jésuites, R. P. Vitelleschi, approuva\r\n     cette décision. Là-dessus, Innocent X. se mit à fonder la maison\r\n     Pamphili, à construire le palais Pamphili, à créer la villa\r\n     Pamphili, et à pamphiliser, tant qu'il put, les finances de\r\n     l'église et de l'état.\"--_About, Rome Contemporaine._\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of returning to Rome from the Villa Doria--one, which\r\ndescends straight into the valley to the Porta Cavalleggieri, passing on\r\nthe left the Church of Sta. Maria delle Fornaci; the other, skirting the\r\nwalls of the city beneath the Villa Lante, which passes a _Chapel_,\r\nwhere St. Andrew's head, lost one day by the canons of St. Peter's, was\r\nmiraculously re-discovered!\r\n\r\n     \"On ne voit pas que de nouveaux monuments religieux se rapportent\r\n     aux deux apparitions de Pyrrhus en Italie; seulement les augures\r\n     firent rétablir le temple du dieu des foudres nocturnes, le dieu\r\n     étrusco-sabin Summanus, en expiation sans doute de ce que la tête\r\n     de la statue de Summanus, placée sur le temple de Jupiter\r\n     Capitolin, avait été détachée par la foudre, et, après qu'on l'eut\r\n     cherchée en vain, retrouvée dans le Tibre.\r\n\r\n     \"Je ne compare pas, mais j'ai vu le long des murs de Rome, entre la\r\n     porte Cavalleggieri et la porte Saint Pancrace, une petite chapelle\r\n     élevée au lieu où l'on a retrouvé la tête de Saint André apportée\r\n     solennellement de Constantinople à Rome au quinzième siècle, et qui\r\n     s'était perdue.\"--_Ampère, Hist.

Maria sopra\r\nMinerva\r\n\r\n[272] This pagan benediction of the animals is represented in a\r\nbas-relief in the Vatican (Museo Pio-Clementino, 157). A peasant bearing\r\ntwo ducks as his offering, brings his cow to be blessed by a priest at\r\nthe door of a chapel, and the priest delaying to come forth, a calf\r\ndrinks up the holy water. Ovid describes how he took part in the feast\r\nof Pales, and sprinkled the cattle with a laurel bough. (_Fasti_, iv.\r\n728.)\r\n\r\n[273] His flat tombstone is in the centre of the nave.\r\n\r\n[274] This story is the subject of two of Murillo's most beautiful\r\npictures in the Academy at Madrid. The first represents the vision of\r\nthe Virgin to John and his wife,--in the second they tell what they have\r\nseen to Pope Liberius.\r\n\r\n[275] This mosaic will bring to mind the beautiful lines of Dante:--\r\n\r\n    \"L'amor che mosse già l'eterno padre\r\n    Per figlia aver di sua Deita trina\r\n    Costei che fu del figlio suo poi madre\r\n    Dell' universo qui fa la regina.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[276] See Sta. Dorothea, ch. xvii.\r\n\r\n[277] St. Venantius was a child martyred at Camerino, under Decius, in\r\n250. Pope Clement X., who had been bishop of Camerino, had a peculiar\r\nveneration for this saint.\r\n\r\n[278] This figure of the Virgin is of great interest, as introducing the\r\nGreek classical type under which she is so often afterwards represented\r\nin Latin art.\r\n\r\n[279] It was near the Lateran, on the site of the gardens of Plautius\r\nLateranus, that the famous statues of the Niobedes, attributed to\r\nScopus, now at Florence, were found. The fine tomb of the Plautii is a\r\nstriking object on the road to Tivoli.\r\n\r\n[280] See Sta. Pudenziana, ch. x.\r\n\r\n[281] These columns are mentioned in the thirteenth century list of\r\nLateran relics, which says that _all_ the relics of the Temple at\r\nJerusalem brought by Titus, were preserved at the Lateran.\r\n\r\n[282] There is a curious mosaic portrait of Clement XII. in the Palazzo\r\nCorsini.\r\n\r\n[283] Sergius III. ob. 911; Agapetus II. ob. 956; John XII. ob. 964;\r\nSylvester II. ob. 1003; John XVIII. ob. 1009; Alexander II. ob. 1073;\r\nPascal II. ob. 1118; Calixtus II. ob. 1124; Honorius II. ob. 1140;\r\nCelestine II. ob. 1143; Lucius II. ob. 1145; Anastasius IV. ob. 1154;\r\nAlexander III. ob. 1159; Clement III. ob. 1191; Celestine III. ob. 1198;\r\nInnocent V. ob. 1276--were buried at St. John Lateran, besides those\r\nlater popes whose tombs still exist.\r\n\r\n[284] \"Ces monuments, consacrés par la tradition, n'ont pas été jugés\r\ncependant assez authentiques pour être solennellement exposés a la\r\nvénération des fidèles.\"--_Gournerie._\r\n\r\n[285] Sta. Helena is claimed as an English saint, and all the best\r\nauthorities allow that she was born in England,--according to Gibbon, at\r\nYork--according to others, at Colchester, which town bears as its arms a\r\ncross between three crowns, in allusion to this claim. Some say that she\r\nwas an innkeeper's daughter, others that her father was a powerful\r\nBritish prince, Coilus or Coel.\r\n\r\n[286] Emp. ii. 43.\r\n\r\n[287] The existence of this inscription makes the destruction of this\r\ncatacomb under Pius IX. the more extraordinary.\r\n\r\n[288] Dyer's Rome, 70.\r\n\r\n[289] Ampère, Hist. ii. 10.\r\n\r\n[290] Ampère, Emp. i. 184.\r\n\r\n[291] Pliny, H.
