He arrived in Manila with a\r\nthorough command of the Spanish language, and soon acquired a knowledge\r\nof the Tagal dialect. His avocations brought him into contact with all\r\nclasses of the community--officials, priests, land-owners, mechanics,\r\nand peasantry: giving him an unrivalled opportunity to learn their\r\nideas and observe their manners and customs. He resided in Luzon\r\nfor fourteen years, making trips either on business or for sport all\r\nover the Central and Southern Provinces, also visiting Cebu, Iloilo,\r\nand other ports in Visayas, as well as Calamianes, Cuyos, and Palawan.\r\n\r\nOld Spanish chroniclers praise the good breeding of the natives,\r\nand remark the quick intelligence of the young.\r\n\r\nRecent writers are less favourable; Canamaque holds them up to\r\nridicule, Monteverde denies them the possession of any good quality\r\neither of body or mind.\r\n\r\nForeman declares that a voluntary concession of justice is regarded by\r\nthem as a sign of weakness; other writers judge them from a few days'\r\nexperience of some of the cross-bred corrupted denizens of Manila.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitelaw Reid denounces them as rebels, savages, and treacherous\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley is struck by their ingratitude for American kindness\r\nand mercy.\r\n\r\nSenator Beveridge declares that the inhabitants of Mindanao are\r\nincapable of civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been left to French and German contemporary\r\nwriters, such as Dr. Montano and Professor Blumentritt to show a more\r\nappreciative, and the author thinks, a fairer spirit, than those who\r\nhave requited the hospitality of the Filipinos by painting them in\r\nthe darkest colours. It will be only fair to exempt from this censure\r\ntwo American naval officers, Paymaster Wilcox and Mr. L. S. Sargent,\r\nwho travelled in North Luzon and drew up a report of what they saw.\r\n\r\nAs regards the accusation of being savages, the Tagals can claim to\r\nhave treated their prisoners of war, both Spaniards and Americans\r\nwith humanity, and to be fairer fighters than the Boers.\r\n\r\nThe writer has endeavoured to describe the people as he found them. If\r\nhis estimate of them is more favourable than that of others, it may\r\nbe that he exercised more care in declining to do business with, or\r\nto admit to his service natives of doubtful reputation; for he found\r\nhis clients punctual in their payments, and his employes, workmen\r\nand servants, skilful, industrious, and grateful for benefits bestowed.\r\n\r\nIf the natives fared badly at the hands of recent authors, the Spanish\r\nAdministration fared worse, for it has been painted in the darkest\r\ntints, and unsparingly condemned.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed corrupt and defective, and what government is not? More\r\nthan anything, it was behind the age, yet it was not without its\r\ngood points.\r\n\r\nUntil an inept bureaucracy was substituted for the old paternal rule,\r\nand the revenue quadrupled by increased taxation, the Filipinos were\r\nas happy a community as could be found in any colony. The population\r\ngreatly multiplied; they lived in competence, if not in affluence;\r\ncultivation was extended, and the exports steadily increased.\r\n\r\nThe natives were secured the perpetual usufruct of the land they\r\ntilled, they were protected against the usurer, that curse of East\r\nand West.\r\n\r\nIn guaranteeing the land to the husbandman, the \"Laws of the Indies\"\r\ncompare favourably with the law of the United States regarding\r\nIndian land tenure. The Supreme Court in 1823 decided that \"discovery\r\ngives the dominion of the land discovered to the States of which the\r\ndiscoverers were the subjects.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been almost an axiom with some writers that no advance was\r\nmade or could be made under Spanish rule.\r\n\r\nThere were difficulties indeed. The Colonial Minister, importuned on\r\nthe one hand by doctrinaire liberals, whose crude schemes of reform\r\nwould have set the Archipelago on fire, and confronted on the other\r\nby the serried phalanx of the Friars with their hired literary bravos,\r\nwas very much in the position of being between the devil and the deep\r\nsea, or, as the Spaniards phrase it \"entre la espada y la pared.\"\r\n\r\nEven thus the Administration could boast of some reforms and\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThe hateful slavery of the Cagayanes had been abolished; the forced\r\ncultivation of tobacco was a thing of the past, and in all the\r\nArchipelago the corvee had been reduced.\r\n\r\nA telegraph cable connecting Manila with Hong Kong and the world's\r\ntelegraph system had been laid and subsidized. Telegraph wires were\r\nextended to all the principal towns of Luzon; lines of mail steamers\r\nto all the principal ports of the Archipelago were established and\r\nsubsidized. A railway 120 miles long had been built from Manila to\r\nDagupan under guarantee. A steam tramway had been laid to Malabon,\r\nand horse tramways through the suburbs of Manila. The Quay walls of\r\nthe Pasig had been improved, and the river illuminated from its mouth\r\nto the bridge by powerful electric arc lights.\r\n\r\nSeveral lighthouses had been built, others were in progress. A\r\ncapacious harbour was in construction, although unfortunately defective\r\nin design and execution. The Manila waterworks had been completed\r\nand greatly reduced the mortality of the city. The schools were well\r\nattended, and a large proportion of the population could read and\r\nwrite. Technical schools had been established in Manila and Iloilo, and\r\nwere eagerly attended. Credit appears to be due to the Administration\r\nfor these measures, but it is rare to see any mention of them.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Religious Orders that have played so important a part\r\nscarcely a word has been said in their favour. Worcester declares\r\nhis conviction that their influence is wholly bad. However they take\r\na lot of killing and seem to have got round the Peace Commission and\r\nGeneral Otis.\r\n\r\nThey are not wholly bad, and they have had a glorious history. They\r\nheld the islands from 1570 to 1828, without any permanent garrison\r\nof Spanish regular troops, and from 1828 to 1883 with about 1500\r\nartillerymen. They did not entirely rely upon brute force. They are\r\ncertainly no longer suited to the circumstances of the Philippines\r\nhaving survived their utility. They are an anachronism. But they have\r\nbrought the Philippines a long way on the path of civilisation. Let us\r\nbe just; what British, French, or Dutch colony, populated by natives,\r\ncan compare with the Philippines as they were till 1895?\r\n\r\nAnd what about American rule? It has begun unfortunately, and has\r\nraised a feeling of hatred in the natives that will take a generation\r\nto efface. It will not be enough for the United States to beat down\r\narmed resistance. A huge army must be maintained to keep the natives\r\ndown. As soon as the Americans are at war with one of the Great Powers,\r\nthe natives will rise; whenever a land-tax is imposed there will be\r\nan insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe great difference between this war and former insurrections is\r\nthat now for the first time the natives have rifles and ammunition,\r\nand have learned to use them. Not all the United States Navy can\r\nstop them from bringing in fresh supplies. Unless some arrangement\r\nis come to with the natives, there can be no lasting peace. Such an\r\narrangement I believe quite possible, and that it could be brought\r\nabout in a manner satisfactory to both parties.\r\n\r\nThis would not be, however, on the lines suggested in the National\r\nReview of September under the heading, \"Will the United States withdraw\r\nfrom the Philippines?\"\r\n\r\nThree centuries of Spanish rule is not a fit preparation for\r\nundertaking the government of the Archipelago. But Central and Southern\r\nLuzon, with the adjacent islands, might be formed into a State whose\r\ninhabitants would be all Tagals and Vicols, and the northern part into\r\nanother State whose most important peoples would be the Pampangos,\r\nthe Pangasinanes, the Ilocanos, and the Cagayanes; the Igorrotes and\r\nother heathen having a special Protector to look after their interests.\r\n\r\nVisayas might form a third State, all the inhabitants being of that\r\nrace, whilst Mindanao and Southern Palawan should be entirely governed\r\nby Americans like a British Crown Colony.\r\n\r\nThe Sulu Sultanate could be a Protectorate similar to North Borneo\r\nor the Malay States. Manila could be a sort of Federal District, and\r\nthe Consuls would be accredited to the President's representative,\r\nthe foreign relations being solely under his direction. There should\r\nbe one tariff for all the islands, for revenue only, treating all\r\nnations alike, the custom houses, telegraphs, post offices, and\r\nlighthouse service being administered by United States officials,\r\neither native or American. With power thus limited, the Tagals,\r\nPampangos, and Visayas might be entrusted with their own affairs, and\r\nno garrisons need be kept, except in certain selected healthy spots,\r\nalways having transports at hand to convey them wherever they were\r\nwanted. If, as seems probable, Mr. McKinley should be re-elected,\r\nI hope he will attempt some such arrangement, and I heartily wish him\r\nsuccess in pacifying this sorely troubled country, the scene of four\r\nyears continuous massacre.\r\n\r\nThe Archipelago is at present in absolute anarchy, the exports have\r\ndiminished by half, and whereas we used to travel and camp out in\r\nabsolute security, now no white man dare show his face more than a\r\nmile from a garrison.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, some supporters of the Administration in the\r\nStates are advising young men with capital that there is a great\r\nopening for them as planters in the Islands.\r\n\r\nThere may be when the Islands are pacified, but not before.\r\n\r\nTo all who contemplate proceeding to or doing any business, or taking\r\nstock in any company in the Philippines, I recommend a careful study\r\nof my book. They cannot fail to benefit by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRed Hill, Oct. 15th, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALAMAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author desires to express his hearty thanks to all those who have\r\nassisted him.\r\n\r\nTo Father Joaquin Sancho, S.J., Procurator of Colonial Missions,\r\nMadrid, for the books, maps and photographs relating to Mindanao,\r\nwith permission to use them.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. H.

This\r\ngives an extreme length of 1100 miles, whilst the extreme breadth is\r\nabout 680 miles, measured a little below the 8th parallel from the\r\nIsland of Balabac to the east coast of Mindanao.\r\n\r\nVarious authorities give the number of islands and islets at 1200 and\r\nupwards; many have probably never been visited by a white man. We need\r\nonly concern ourselves with the principal islands and those adjacent\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nFrom the hydrographic survey carried out by officers of the Spanish\r\nNavy, the following areas have been calculated and are considered\r\nofficial, except those marked with an asterisk, which are only\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Sq.

Luzon is the finest diamond that\r\nthe Spanish adventurers have ever found.\r\n\r\n\"It has remained uncut in their hands; but deliver over Luzon to\r\nBritish activity and tolerance, or else to the laborious tenacity\r\nof the Dutch Creoles, and you will see what will come out of this\r\nmarvellous gem.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Guignes says: \"Of the numerous colonies belonging to\r\nthe Spaniards, as one of the most important must indisputably be\r\nreckoned the Philippines. Their position, their great fertility, and\r\nthe nature of their productions, render them admirably adapted for\r\nactive commerce, and if the Spaniards have not derived much benefit\r\nfrom them, to themselves and to their manner of training is the fault\r\nto be ascribed.\"\r\n\r\nHerr Jagor, speaking of the Province of Bulacan, says the roads were\r\ngood and were continuously shaded by fruit trees, cocoa and areca\r\npalms, and the aspect of this fruitful province reminded him of the\r\nrichest districts in Java, but he found the pueblos here exhibited\r\nmore comfort than the desas there.\r\n\r\nMr. Gifford Palgrave says: \"Not the AEgean, not the West Indian,\r\nnot the Samoan, not any other of the fair island clusters by which\r\nour terraqueous planet half atones for her dreary expanses of\r\ngrey ocean and monotonous desert elsewhere, can rival in manifold\r\nbeauties of earth, sea, sky, the Philippine Archipelago; nor in all\r\nthat Archipelago, lovely as it is through its entire extent, can any\r\nisland vie with the glories of Luzon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariety of Landscape.\r\n\r\nIf I may without presumption add my testimony to that of these\r\nillustrious travellers, I would say that, having been over a great\r\npart of South America, from Olinda Point to the Straits of Magellan,\r\nfrom Tierra del Fuego to Panama, not only on the coasts but in the\r\ninterior, from the Pampas of the Argentine and the swamps of the Gran\r\nChaco to where\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"The roots of the Andes strike deep in the earth\r\n        As their summits to heaven shoot soaringly forth;\"\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving traversed the fairest gems of the Antilles and seen some of the\r\nloveliest landscapes in Japan, I know of no land more beautiful than\r\nLuzon, certainly of none possessing more varied features or offering\r\nmore striking contrasts.\r\n\r\nLimestone cliffs and pinnacles, cracked and hollowed into labyrinthine\r\ncaves, sharp basalt peaks, great ranges of mountains, isolated\r\nvolcanic cones, cool crystalline springs, jets of boiling water,\r\ncascades, rivers, lakes, swamps, narrow valleys and broad plains,\r\nrocky promontories and coral reefs, every feature is present, except\r\nthe snow-clad peak and the glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetation.\r\n\r\nVegetation here runs riot, hardly checked by the devastating typhoon,\r\nor the fall of volcanic ashes. From the cocoa-nut palm growing on\r\nthe coral strand, from the mangrove, building its pyramid of roots\r\nupon the ooze, to the giant bamboo on the banks of the streams, and\r\nthe noble mango tree adorning the plains, every tropical species\r\nflourishes in endless variety, and forests of conifers [2] clothe\r\nthe summits of the Zambales and Ilocan mountains.\r\n\r\nAs for the forest wealth, the trees yielding indestructible timber\r\nfor ships, houses or furniture, those giving valuable drugs and\r\nhealing oils, gums and pigments, varnishes, pitch and resin, dyes,\r\nsap for fermenting or distilling, oil for burning, water, vinegar,\r\nmilk, fibre, charcoal, pitch, fecula, edible fungi, tubers, bark and\r\nfruits, it would take a larger book than this to enumerate them in\r\ntheir incredible variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMango Trees.\r\n\r\nA notable feature of the Philippine landscape is the mango tree. This\r\ntruly magnificent tree is often of perfect symmetry, and rears aloft on\r\nits massive trunk and wide-spreading branches a perfect dome of green\r\nand glistening leaves, adorned in season with countless strings of\r\nsweet-scented blossom and pendent clusters of green and golden fruit,\r\nincomparably luscious, unsurpassed, unequalled.\r\n\r\nBeneath that shapely vault of verdure the feathered tribes find\r\nshelter. The restless mango bird [3] displays his contrasted plumage of\r\nblack and yellow as he flits from bough to bough, the crimson-breasted\r\npigeon and the ring-dove rest secure.\r\n\r\nThese glorious trees are pleasing objects for the eye to rest on. All\r\nthrough the fertile valleys of Luzon they stand singly or in groups,\r\nand give a character to the landscape which would otherwise be\r\nlacking. Only the largest and finest English oaks can compare with\r\nthe mango trees in appearance; but whilst the former yield nothing\r\nof value, one or two mango trees will keep a native family in comfort\r\nand even affluence with their generous crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamboos.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Philippine streams and rivers that giant grass,\r\nthe thorny bamboo, grows and thrives. It grows in clumps of twenty,\r\nforty, fifty stems. Starting from the ground, some four to six inches\r\nin diameter, it shoots aloft for perhaps seventy feet, tapering to\r\nthe thickness of a match at its extremity, putting forth from each\r\njoint slender and thorny branches, carrying small, thin, and pointed\r\nleaves, so delicately poised as to rustle with the least breath of air.\r\n\r\nThe canes naturally take a gradual curve which becomes more and more\r\naccentuated as their diameter diminishes, until they bend over at\r\ntheir tops and sway freely in the breeze.\r\n\r\nI can only compare a fine clump of bamboos to a giant plume of green\r\nostrich feathers. Nothing in the vegetable kingdom is more graceful,\r\nnothing can be more useful. Under the blast of a typhoon the bamboo\r\nbends so low that it defies all but the most sudden and violent\r\ngusts. If, however, it succumbs, it is generally the earth under it\r\nthat gives way, and the whole clump falls, raising its interlaced\r\nroots and a thick wall of earth adhering to and embraced by them.\r\n\r\nPiercing the hard earth, shoving aside the stones with irresistible\r\nforce, comes the new bamboo, its head emerging like a giant artichoke.\r\n\r\nEach flinty-headed shoot soars aloft with a rapidity astonishing to\r\nthose who have only witnessed the tardy growth of vegetation in the\r\ntemperate zone. I carefully measured a shoot of bamboo in my garden\r\nin Santa Ana and found that it grew two feet in three days, that is,\r\neight inches a day, 1/3 inch per hour. I could see it grow. When\r\nI commenced to measure the shoot it was eighteen inches high and\r\nwas four inches in diameter. This rapid growth, which, considering\r\nthe extraordinary usefulness of the bamboo ought to excite man's\r\ngratitude to Almighty Providence, has, to the shame of human nature,\r\nled the Malay and the Chinaman to utilise the bamboo to inflict death\r\nby hideous torture on his fellow men. (See Tukang Burok's story in\r\nHugh Clifford's 'Studies of Brown Humanity.')\r\n\r\nEach joint is carefully enveloped by nature in a wrapper as tough as\r\nparchment, covered, especially round the edges, with millions of small\r\nspines. The wrapper, when dry, is brown, edged with black, but when\r\nfresh the colours are remarkable, pale yellow, dark yellow, orange,\r\nbrown, black, pale green, dark green, black; all shaded or contrasted\r\nin a way to make a Parisian dress designer feel sick with envy.\r\n\r\nThis wrapper does not fall off till the joint has hardened and acquired\r\nits flinty armour so as to be safe from damage by any animal.\r\n\r\nIt would take a whole chapter to enumerate the many and varied uses\r\nof the bamboo.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say that I cannot conceive how the Philippine native\r\ncould do without it.\r\n\r\nEverlastingly renewing its youth, perpetually soaring to the sky,\r\nproudly overtopping all that grows, splendidly flourishing when meaner\r\nplants must fade from drought, this giant grass, which delights the\r\neyes, takes rank as one of God's noblest gifts to tropical man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSPANISH GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n    Slight sketch of organization--Distribution of\r\n    population--Collection of taxes--The stick.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supreme head of the administration was a Governor-General or\r\nCaptain-General of the Philippines. The British Colonial Office has\r\npreserved this Spanish title in Jamaica where the supreme authority\r\nis still styled Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nIn recent years no civilian has been Governor-General of\r\nthe Philippines, the appointment being given or sold to a\r\nLieutenant-General, though in 1883 a Field-Marshal was sent out. But\r\nin 1874 Rear-Admiral Malcampo obtained the post, and a very weak and\r\nfoolish Governor-General he turned out to be.\r\n\r\nIn former times military men did not have a monopoly of such posts,\r\nand civilians, judges, priests, and bishops have held this appointment.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General had great powers. Practically, if not legally,\r\nhe had the power of life and death, for he could proclaim martial\r\nlaw and try offenders by court-martial. He was ex officio president\r\nof every corporation or commission, and he could expel from the\r\nIslands any person, whether Spaniard, native, or foreigner, by a\r\ndecree declaring that his presence was inconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlight Sketch of Organization.\r\n\r\nHe could suspend or remove any official, and in fact was almost\r\ndespotic. On the other hand he had to remember two important\r\nlimitations. Unless he supported the religious orders against all\r\ncomers he would have the Procurators of these wealthy corporations, who\r\nreside in Madrid, denouncing him to the Ministry as an anti-clerical,\r\nand a freemason, and perhaps offering a heavy bribe for his removal. If\r\nhe made an attempt to put down corruption and embezzlement in the\r\nAdministration, his endeavours would be thwarted in every possible way\r\nby the officials, and a formidable campaign of calumny and detraction\r\nwould be inaugurated against him. The appointment was for a term\r\nof three years at a salary of $40,000 per annum, and certain very\r\nliberal travelling allowances.\r\n\r\nSince the earthquake of 1863 the official residence of the\r\nGovernors-General was at Malacanan, on the River Pasig in the ward of\r\nSan Miguel. This is now the residence of the American Governor. He had\r\na troop of native Lancers to escort him when he drove out, and a small\r\ncorps of Halberdiers for duty within the palace and grounds. These\r\nlatter wore a white uniform with red facings, and were armed with a\r\nlong rapier and a halberd. They were also furnished with rifles and\r\nbayonets for use in case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nWhen the Governor-General drove out, every man saluted him by raising\r\nhis hat--and when he went to the Cathedral he was received by the\r\nclergy at the door, and, on account of being the Vice-Regal Patron,\r\nwas conducted under a canopy along the nave to a seat of honour.\r\n\r\nHis position was in fact one of great power and dignity, and it was\r\nfelt necessary to surround the representative of the king with much\r\npomp and state in order to impress the natives with his importance\r\nand authority.\r\n\r\nThere was a Governor-General of Visayas who resided at Cebu, and was\r\nnaturally subordinate to the Governor-General of the Philippines. He\r\nwas usually a Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\nIn case of the death or absence of the Governor-General, the\r\ntemporary command devolved upon the Segundo Cabo, a general officer\r\nin immediate command of the military forces.

Those\r\nprovinces which were entirely pacified had Civil Governors, whilst\r\nthose more liable to disturbance or attack from independent tribes\r\nor from the Moors had Military Governors. Up to 1886 the pacified\r\nprovinces were governed by Alcaldes-Mayores, who were both governors\r\nand judges. An appeal from their decisions could be made to the\r\nAudiencia or High Court at Manila.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of their appointment, the Alcaldes were allowed\r\nto trade. Some appointments carried the right to trade, but most of\r\nthe Alcaldes had to covenant to forego a large proportion of their very\r\nmodest stipends in order to obtain this privilege. By trade and by the\r\nfees and squeezes of their law courts they usually managed to amass\r\nfortunes. In 1844 the Alcaldes were finally prohibited from trading.\r\n\r\nThis was a rude system of government, but it was cheap, and a populous\r\nprovince might only have to maintain half-a-dozen Spaniards.\r\n\r\nEach town has its municipality consisting of twelve principales,\r\nall natives, six are chosen from those who have already been\r\nGobernadorcillos. They are called past-captains, and correspond to\r\naldermen who have passed the chair. The other six are chosen from\r\namongst the Barangay headmen. From these twelve are elected all\r\nthe officials, the Gobernadorcillo or Capitan, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd\r\nlieutenants, the alguaciles (constables), the judges of the fields, of\r\ncattle, and of police. The Capitan appoints and pays the directorcillo\r\nor town clerk, who attends to the routine business.\r\n\r\nFor the maintenance of order, and for protecting the town against\r\nattack, there is a body of local police called Cuadrilleros. These\r\nare armed with bolos and lances in the smaller and poorer towns,\r\nbut in more important places they have fire-arms usually of obsolete\r\npattern. But in towns exposed to Moro attack the cuadrilleros are\r\nmore numerous, and carry Remington rifles.\r\n\r\nThe Gobernadorcillos of towns were directly responsible to the\r\ngovernor of the province, the governor in case of emergency reported\r\ndirect to the Governor-General, but for routine business through\r\nthe Director-General of Civil Administration, which embraced the\r\ndepartments of Public Works, Inspection of Mines and Forests, Public\r\nInstruction, Model Farms, etc.\r\n\r\nThe collection of taxes was under the governors of provinces assisted\r\nby delegates of the Intendant-General. It was directly effected by\r\nthe Barangay headman each of whom was supposed to answer for fifty\r\nfamilies, the individuals of which were spoken of as his sacopes. His\r\neldest son was recognised as his chief assistant, and he, like his\r\nfather, was exempt from the tribute or capitation tax.\r\n\r\nThe office was hereditary, and was not usually desired, but like the\r\npost of sheriff in an English county it had to be accepted nolens\r\nvolens.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a great deal of latitude was allowed to the Barangay Chiefs\r\nin order that they might collect the tax, and the stick was often in\r\nrequisition. In fact the chiefs had to pay the tax somehow, and it\r\nis not surprising that they took steps to oblige their sacopes to pay.\r\n\r\nI, however, in my fourteen years' experience, never came across such a\r\ncase as that mentioned by Worcester, p. 295, where he states that in\r\nconsequence of a deficiency of $7000, forty-four headmen of Siquijor\r\nwere seized and exiled, their lands, houses and cattle confiscated,\r\nand those dependent on them left to shift for themselves. The amount\r\nowing by each headman was under $160 Mexican, equal to $80 gold, and\r\nit would not take much in the way of lands, houses, and cattle to pay\r\noff this sum. However, it is true that Siquijor is a poor island. But\r\non page 284 he maintains that the inhabitants of Siquijor had plenty\r\nof money to back their fighting-cocks, and paid but little attention\r\nto the rule limiting each man's bet on one fight to $50. From this\r\nwe may infer that they could find money to bet with, but not to pay\r\ntheir taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollection of Taxes.\r\n\r\nNatives of the gorgeous East very commonly require a little persuasion\r\nto make them pay their taxes, and I have read of American millionaires\r\nwho, in the absence of this system, could not be got to pay at all. Not\r\nmany years ago, there was an enquiry as to certain practices resorted\r\nto by native tax-collectors in British India to induce the poor Indian\r\nto pay up; anybody who is curious to know the particulars can hunt\r\nthem up in the Blue Books--they are unsuitable for publication.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, up to 1887, or thereabouts, the \"courbash\" [4] was in use\r\nfor this purpose. I quote from a speech by Lord Cromer delivered about\r\nthat time ('Lord Cromer,' by H. D. Traill): \"The courbash used to be\r\nvery frequently employed for two main objects, viz.: the collection of\r\ntaxes, and the extortion of evidence. I think I may say with confidence\r\nthat the use of the courbash as a general practice in connection either\r\nwith collection of taxes or the extortion of evidence has ceased.\"\r\n\r\nBut we need not go so far East for examples of collecting taxes by\r\nmeans of the stick. The headmen of the village communities in Russia\r\nfreely apply the lash to recalcitrant defaulters.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that the Spaniards erred in company with\r\nmany other nations. It was by no means an invention of theirs, and\r\nit will be remembered that some of our early kings used to persuade\r\nthe Jews to pay up by drawing their teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIts Good Points.\r\n\r\nThe Government and the laws partook of a patriarchal character,\r\nand notwithstanding certain exactions, the Spanish officials and\r\nthe natives got on very well together. The Alcaldes remained for\r\nmany years in one province, and knew all the principal people\r\nintimately. I doubt if there was any colony in the world where as\r\nmuch intercourse took place between the governors and the natives,\r\ncertainly not in any British colony, nor in British India, where the\r\ngulf ever widens. In this case, governors and governed professed\r\nthe same religion, and no caste distinctions prevailed to raise a\r\nbarrier between them. They could worship together, they could eat\r\ntogether, and marriages between Spaniards and the daughters of the\r\nnative landowners were not unfrequent. These must be considered\r\ngood points, and although the general corruption and ineptitude of\r\nthe administration was undeniable, yet, bad as it was, it must be\r\nadmitted that it was immeasurably superior to any government that\r\nany Malay community had ever established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSIX GOVERNORS-GENERAL.\r\n\r\n    Moriones--Primo de Rivera--Jovellar--Terreros--Weyler--Despujols.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoriones.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence in the Islands--from 1877 to 1892--there were\r\nsix Governors-General, and they differed very widely in character\r\nand ideas.\r\n\r\nThe first was Don Domingo Moriones y Murillo, Marquis of Oroquieto,\r\nan austere soldier, and a stern disciplinarian. He showed himself to\r\nbe a man of undaunted courage, and of absolutely incorruptible honesty.\r\n\r\nWhen he landed in Manila he found that, owing to the weakness of\r\nAdmiral Malcampo, his predecessor, the Peninsular Regiment of Artillery\r\nhad been in open mutiny, and that the matter had been hushed up. After\r\ntaking the oath of office, and attending a Te Deum at the Cathedral,\r\nhe mounted his horse, and, attended by his aides-de-camp, rode to the\r\nbarracks, and ordered the regiment to parade under arms. He rode down\r\nthe ranks, and recognised many soldiers who had served under him in\r\nthe Carlist wars.\r\n\r\nHe then stationed himself in front of the regiment, and delivered a\r\nremarkable and most stirring oration. He said that it grieved him to\r\nthe heart to think that Spanish soldiers, sent to the Philippines to\r\nmaintain the authority of their king and country, many of whom had\r\nwith him faced the awful fusillade of Somorrostro, and had bravely\r\ndone their duty, could fall so low as to become callous mutineers,\r\ndeaf to the calls of duty, and by their bad conduct tarnish the\r\nglory of the Spanish Army in the eyes of all the world. Such as\r\nthey deserved no mercy; their lives were all forfeited. Still he\r\nwas willing to believe that they were not entirely vicious, that\r\nrepentance and reform were still possible to the great majority. He\r\nwould, therefore, spare the lives of most of them in the hope that\r\nthey might once more become worthy soldiers of Spain. But he would\r\ndecimate them; every tenth man must die.\r\n\r\nHe then directed the lieutenant-colonel in command to number off the\r\nregiment by tens from the right.\r\n\r\nLet the reader ponder upon the situation. Here was a mutinous\r\nveteran regiment that for months had been the terror of the city,\r\nand had frightened the Governor-General and all the authorities into\r\ncondoning its crimes.\r\n\r\nIn front of it sat upon his horse one withered old man. But that\r\nman's record was such that he seemed to those reckless mutineers to\r\nbe transfigured into some awful avenging angel. His modest stature\r\ngrew to a gigantic size in their eyes; the whole regiment seemed\r\nhypnotized. They commenced numbering. It was an impressive scene--the\r\nword ten meant death. The men on the extreme right felt happy; they\r\nwere sure to escape. Confidently rang out their voices: one, two,\r\nthree, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine--then a stop. The doomed\r\nwretch standing next would not say the fatal word. Moriones turned\r\nhis glance upon the captain of the right company, and that officer\r\nperceived that the crisis of his life had arrived, and that the next\r\nfew seconds would make or mar him; one instant's hesitation would cost\r\nhim his commission. Drawing and cocking his revolver, he held it in\r\nfront of the forehead of the tenth man, and ordered him to call out\r\nten. Placed thus between the alternative of instant death or obedience,\r\nthe unhappy gunner complied, and the numbering of the whole line was\r\naccomplished. The number tens were ordered to step out of the ranks,\r\nwere disarmed, placed under arrest, and notified that they would\r\nbe shot next morning. As regards the others, all leave was stopped,\r\nand extra drills ordered. Great interest was exerted with Moriones to\r\npardon the condemned men, and he did commute the death sentence on\r\nmost of them, but the ring-leaders were shot the following morning,\r\nothers imprisoned, and fifty were sent back to Spain in the same\r\nvessel as Admiral Malcampo, whose pampering of them had ruined their\r\ndiscipline. So much for the courage of Moriones. It was a wonderful\r\nexample of the prestige of lawful authority, but of course the risk\r\nwas great.\r\n\r\nTo him was due the construction of the Manila Waterworks. A sum of\r\nmoney had been left a century before by Don Francisco Carriedo, who\r\nhad been general of a galleon, to accumulate until it was sufficient\r\nto pay for the waterworks, which ought to have been begun years\r\nbefore. However, the parties who held these funds, like certain\r\nCommissioners we know of at home, had little desire to part with the\r\ncapital, and it was only the determination of General Moriones that\r\ntriumphed over their reluctance.\r\n\r\nManila ought to be ever grateful to Moriones for this. He also\r\ntried to get some work out of the Obras Publicas Department, and,\r\nin fact, he did frighten them into exerting themselves for a time,\r\nby threatening to ship the Inspector-General of Public Works back to\r\nSpain, unless the Ayala bridges were completed on a certain day.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest thing that Moriones did for the Philippines was when\r\nhe prevented the sale of the Government tobacco-culture monopoly to\r\nsome Paris Jews. Whilst he was staying at the Convent of Guadalupe\r\nhe received a letter from Canovas, at the time Prime Minister of\r\nSpain. It informed him that a project was entertained of selling the\r\nCrown monopoly of the cultivation and manufacture of tobacco in the\r\nPhilippines to a Franco-Spanish syndicate, and added, \"The palace is\r\nvery interested,\" meaning that the King and the Infantas were in the\r\naffair. It announced that a Commission was about to be sent by the\r\ncapitalists to enquire into the business, and wound up by requesting\r\nMoriones to report favourably on the affair, for which service he\r\nmight ask any reward he liked. The carrying out of this project meant\r\nselling the inhabitants of Cagayan into slavery.\r\n\r\nI had this information from a gentleman of unblemished truth and\r\nhonour, who was present at the receipt of the letter, and it was\r\nconfirmed by two friars of the Augustinian Order under circumstances\r\nthat left no doubt upon my mind as to their accuracy.\r\n\r\nAlthough Canovas was at the time in the height of his power, and\r\nalthough the King was interested in the matter going through, Moriones\r\nindignantly refused to back up the proposal. He wrote or cabled to\r\nCanovas not to send out the Commission, for if it came he would send\r\nit back by the same vessel. He reported dead against the concession,\r\nand told the Prime Minister that he was quite prepared to resign,\r\nand return to Spain, to explain his reasons from his seat in the\r\nSenate. What a contrast this brave soldier made to the general run\r\nof men; how few in any country would have behaved as he did!\r\n\r\nThis was not the only benefit Moriones conferred upon the tobacco\r\ncultivators of Cagayan, for he did what he could to pay off the debt\r\nowing to them by the Treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrimo de Rivera.\r\n\r\nThe next Governor-General was Don Fernando Primo de Rivera, Marquis\r\nof Estella, and he was the only one with whom I was not personally\r\nacquainted. During the cholera epidemic of 1882, when 30,000 persons\r\ndied in the city and province of Manila, he showed ability and firmness\r\nin the arrangements he made, and he deserves great credit for this. But\r\ncorruption and embezzlement was rampant during his time. Gambling was\r\ntolerated in Manila and it was currently reported that twenty-five\r\ngambling houses were licensed and that each paid $50 per day, which\r\nwas supposed to go to the Governor-General. Emissaries from these\r\nhouses were stationed near the banks and mercantile offices, and\r\nwhenever a collector was seen entering or leaving carrying a bag of\r\ndollars, an endeavour was made to entice him to the gambling table,\r\nand owing to the curious inability of the native to resist temptation,\r\nthese overtures were too frequently successful.\r\n\r\nThe whole city became demoralised, servants and dependants stole from\r\ntheir employers and sold the articles to receivers for a tenth of\r\ntheir value in order to try their luck at the gaming table. A sum of\r\n$1250 per day was derived from the gambling-houses and was collected\r\nevery evening.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these abuses, Primo de Rivera maintained good\r\nrelations with the natives; he was not unpopular, and no disturbances\r\noccurred during his first government. He owed his appointment to King\r\nAlfonso XII., being granted three years' pillage of the Philippine\r\nIslands as a reward for having made the pronunciamento in favour\r\nof that monarch, which greatly contributed to putting him upon the\r\nthrone. He and his friends must have amassed an enormous sum of\r\nmoney, for scarcely a cent was expended on roads or bridges during\r\nhis government, the provincial governors simply pocketed every dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJovellar.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Field-Marshal Don Joaquim Jovellar, during\r\nwhose time the tribute was abolished and the Cedulas Personales tax\r\ninstituted. Jovellar appeared to me to be a strictly honourable man,\r\nhe refused the customary presents from the Chinese, and bore himself\r\nwith much dignity. His entourage was, however, deplorable, and he\r\nplaced too much confidence in Ruiz Martinez, the Director of Civil\r\nAdministration. The result was that things soon became as bad as in\r\nthe previous governor's time. Jovellar was well advanced in years,\r\nbeing nearly seventy. He had many family troubles, and the climate\r\ndid not agree with him.\r\n\r\nI remember one stifling night, when I was present at Malacanan at\r\na ball and water fete, given to Prince Oscar, a son of the King of\r\nSweden. The Governor-General had hardly recovered from an illness,\r\nand had that day received most distressing news about two of his sons,\r\nand his daughter Dona Rosita, who was married to Colonel Arsenio\r\nLinares, was laid up and in danger of losing her sight.\r\n\r\nYet in that oppressive heat, and buttoned up in the full dress uniform\r\nof a field-marshal, Jovellar went round the rooms and found a kind\r\nword or compliment for every lady present. I ventured to remark how\r\nfatigued he must be, to which he replied, \"Yes, but make no mistake,\r\na public man is like a public woman, and must smile on everybody.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his time, owing to symptoms of unrest amongst the natives,\r\nthe garrison of Manila and Cavite was reinforced by two battalions\r\nof marines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrero.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Don Emilio Terrero y Perinat, a thorough soldier\r\nand a great martinet. I found him a kind and courteous gentleman,\r\nand deeply regretted the unfortunate and tragic end that befell him\r\nafter his return to Spain. I saw a good deal of Field-Marshal Jovellar\r\nand of General Terrero, having been Acting British Consul at the end\r\nof Jovellar's and the beginning of Terrero's Government. I kept up my\r\nacquaintance with General Terrero all the time he was in the islands,\r\nand was favoured with frequent invitations to his table, where I met\r\nall the principal officials.\r\n\r\nThings went on quietly in his time and there was little to record\r\nexcept successful expeditions to Jolo and Mindanao, causing an\r\nextension of Spanish influence in both places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWeyler.\r\n\r\nTerrero was succeeded by Don Valeriano Weyler, Marquis of Tenerife,\r\nthe son of a German doctor, born in Majorca, who brought with him\r\na reputation for cruelties practised on the Cuban insurgents during\r\nthe first war.\r\n\r\nWeyler was said to have purchased the appointment from the wife of a\r\ngreat minister too honest to accept bribes himself, and the price was\r\ncommonly reported to have been $30,000 paid down and an undertaking\r\nto pay the lady an equal sum every year of his term of office.\r\n\r\nWeyler is a small man who does not look like a soldier. He is clever,\r\nbut it is more the cleverness of a sharp attorney than of a general\r\nor statesman.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough the Segundo Cabo at this time was an absolute\r\ncontrast. Don Manuel Giron y Aragon, Marquis of Ahumada, is descended\r\nfrom the Kings of Aragon, and to that illustrious lineage he unites\r\na noble presence and a charm of manner that render him instantly\r\npopular with all who have the good fortune to meet him. No more\r\ndignified representative of his country could be found, and I send\r\nhim my cordial salutation wherever he is serving.\r\n\r\nDuring Weyler's term another expedition to Mindanao was made and\r\nsome advantages secured. Some disturbances occurred which will be\r\nmentioned in another chapter, and secret societies were instituted\r\namongst the natives. Otherwise the usual bribery and corruption\r\ncontinued unchecked.\r\n\r\nThere was a great increase in the smuggling of Mexican dollars from\r\nHong Kong into Manila, where they were worth 10 per cent. more. The\r\nfreight and charges amounted to 2 per cent., leaving 8 per\r\ncent. profit, and according to rumour 4 per cent. was paid to\r\nthe authorities to insure against seizure, as the importation was\r\nprohibited under heavy penalties.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was Government Surveyor of Shipping, and one day\r\nreceived an order from the captain of the port to proceed on board\r\nthe steamer Espana with the colonel of carbineers and point out to him\r\nall hollow places in the ship's construction where anything could be\r\nconcealed. This I did, but remembering Talleyrand's injunction, and\r\nnot liking the duty, showed no zeal, but contented myself with obeying\r\norders. The carbineers having searched every part of the ship below,\r\nwe came on deck where the captain's cabin was. A corporal entered\r\nthe cabin and pulled open one of the large drawers. I only took one\r\nglimpse at it and looked away. It was chock full of small canvas bags,\r\nand no doubt the other drawers and lockers were also full. Yet it did\r\nnot seem to occur to any of the searchers that there might be dollars\r\nin the bags, and it was no business of mine. Nothing contraband had\r\nbeen found in the ship, and a report to that effect was sent in. I\r\nsent the colonel an account for my fee, which was duly paid from the\r\nfunds of the corps.\r\n\r\nWeyler returned to Spain with a large sum of money, a far larger sum\r\nthan the whole of his emoluments. He had remitted large sums in bills,\r\nand having fallen out with one of his confederates who had handled some\r\nof the money, this man exhibited the seconds of exchange to certain\r\nparties inimical to Weyler, with the result that the latter was openly\r\ndenounced as a thief in capital letters in a leading article of the\r\nCorrespondencia Militar of Madrid. Weyler's attorneys threatened to\r\nprosecute for libel, but the editor defied them and declared that he\r\nheld the documents and was prepared to prove his statement. The matter\r\nwas allowed to drop. Weyler was thought to have received large sums\r\nof money from the Augustinians and Dominicans for his armed support\r\nagainst their tenants. It was said that the Chinese furnished him with\r\na first-rate cook, and provided food for his whole household gratis,\r\nbesides making presents of diamonds to his wife. And for holding back\r\ncertain laws which would have pressed very hardly upon them, it was\r\nasserted that the Celestials paid him no less than $80,000. This is\r\nthe man who afterwards carried out the reconcentrado policy in Cuba\r\nat the cost of thousands of lives, and subsequently returning with\r\na colossal fortune to Spain, posed as a patriot and as chief of the\r\nmilitary party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespujols.\r\n\r\nTo Weyler succeeded a man very different in appearance and character,\r\nDon Emilio Despujols, Conde de Caspe.\r\n\r\nBelonging to an ancient and noble family of Catalonia, holding his\r\nhonour dear, endowed with a noble presence and possessed of an ample\r\nfortune, he came out to uplift and uphold the great charge committed\r\nto him, and rather to give lustre to his office by expending his own\r\nmeans than to economise from his pay, as so many colonial governors\r\nare accustomed to do. He established his household upon a splendid\r\nscale, and seconded by his distinguished countess, whose goodness\r\nand munificent charities will ever be remembered, he entertained on a\r\nscale worthy of a viceroy and in a manner never before seen in Manila.\r\n\r\nDespujols rendered justice to all. Several Spaniards whose lives\r\nwere an open scandal, were by his order put on board ship and sent\r\nback to Spain. Amongst these was one who bore the title of count,\r\nbut who lived by gambling.\r\n\r\nAnother was a doctor who openly plundered the natives. Like a Mahometan\r\nSultan of the old times, Despujols was accessible to the poorest who\r\nhad a tale of injustice and oppression to relate.\r\n\r\nThe news that a native could obtain justice from a governor-general\r\nflew with incredible rapidity. At last a new era seemed to\r\nbe opening. A trifling event aroused the enthusiasm of the\r\npeople. Despujols and his countess drove to the Manila races with\r\ntheir postillions dressed in shirts of Jusi and wearing silver-mounted\r\nsalacots instead of their usual livery. I was present on this occasion\r\nand was struck with the unwonted warmth of the governor-general's\r\nreception from the usually phlegmatic natives. Despujols became\r\npopular to an extent never before reached. He could do anything with\r\nthe natives. Whenever his splendid equipages appeared in public he\r\nreceived an ovation. Quite a different spirit now seemed to possess\r\nthe natives. But not all the Spaniards viewed this with satisfaction;\r\nmany whose career of corruption had been checked, who found their\r\nillicit gains decreased, and the victims of their extortion beginning\r\nto resist them, bitterly criticised the new governor-general.\r\n\r\nThe religious orders finding Despujols incorruptible and indisposed\r\nto place military forces at the disposal of the Augustinians\r\nand Dominicans to coerce or evict refractory tenants, then took\r\naction. Their procurators in Madrid made a combined attack on\r\nDespujols, both in the reptile press and by representations to the\r\nministry. They succeeded, and Despujols was dismissed from office by\r\ncable. Rumour has it that the Orders paid $100,000 for Despujols's\r\nrecall. For my own part I think this very likely, and few who know\r\nMadrid will suppose that this decree could be obtained by any other\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nHe laboured under a disadvantage, for he did not pay for his\r\nappointment as some others did. If he had been paying $30,000 a year\r\nto the wife of a powerful minister, he would not have been easily\r\nrecalled. Or if, like another governor-general, he had been in debt\r\nup to the eyes to influential creditors, these would have kept him\r\nin power till he had amassed enough to pay them off.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that had Despujols been retained in Manila, and had\r\nhe been given time to reform and purify the administration, the chain\r\nof events which has now torn the Philippines for ever from the grasp\r\nof Spain would never have been welded. Whoever received the priests'\r\nmoney, whoever they were who divided that Judas-bribe, they deserve\r\nto be held in perpetual execration by their fellow-countrymen, and\r\nto have their names handed down to everlasting infamy.\r\n\r\nDespujols left Manila under a manifestation of respect and devotion\r\nfrom the foreign residents, from the best Spaniards and from every\r\nclass of the natives of the Philippines, that might well go far to\r\nconsole him for his unmerited dismissal. He must have bitterly felt\r\nthe injustice with which he was treated, but still he left carrying\r\nwith him a clear conscience and a harvest of love and admiration that\r\nno previous governor-general had ever inspired.\r\n\r\nFor if Moriones manifested courage, energy and incorruptible honesty\r\nunder what would have been an irresistible temptation to many another\r\nman, that rude soldier was far from possessing those personal gifts,\r\nthe fine presence and the sympathetic address of Despujols, and\r\ninspired fear rather than affection.\r\n\r\nYet both were worthy representatives of their country; both were\r\nmen any land might be proud to send forth. Those two noble names are\r\nsufficient to redeem the Spanish Government of the Philippines from\r\nthe accusation of being entirely corrupt, too frequently made against\r\nit. They deserve an abler pen than mine to extol their merits and\r\nto exalt them as they deserve above the swarm of pilferers, and sham\r\npatriots, who preceded and succeeded them. To use an Eastern image,\r\nthey may be compared to two noble trees towering above the rank\r\nvegetation of some poisonous swamp. For the honour of Spain and of\r\nhuman nature in general, I have always felt grateful that I could say\r\nthat amongst the governors-general of the Philippines whom I had known\r\nthere were at least two entitled to the respect of every honest man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCOURTS OF JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n    Alcaldes--The Audiencia--The Guardia Civil--Do not hesitate\r\n    to shoot--Talas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foulest blot upon the Spanish Administration in all her former\r\ncolonies was undoubtedly the thorough venality of her infamous Courts\r\nof Justice. Unfortunately, amongst the heterogeneous population of\r\nthe Philippines, a low standard of morality prevails and has prevailed\r\nfrom the earliest times. The natives at the time of the conquest were\r\npartly civilised, so far as building houses and cultivating their lands\r\nby slave labour is concerned. But notwithstanding the assertions of\r\nthe Filipinos, the late Dr. Rizal and others, a study of the ancient\r\nauthors demonstrates that they were sunk in ignorance and superstition,\r\nand that their customs were those of semi-savages. When they came under\r\nthe rule of the Spaniards, they might have made great advances if the\r\nadministration of the laws had been confided to persons of honour\r\ncapable of interpreting that wise code, the \"Laws of the Indies,\"\r\nin the noble and Christian spirit which had inspired their makers.\r\n\r\nBut what class of man was it that the Spaniards appointed to this\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nThomas de Comyn, p. 134, says: \"It is quite common to see a barber\r\nor footman of a governor, a sailor or a deserter, transformed into an\r\nAlcalde-Mayor, Sub-delegate, and War Captain of a populous province,\r\nwithout other counsel than his own rude intelligence (understanding)\r\nnor other guide than his passions.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could be expected from such men as these, living in such an\r\natmosphere? And if some solitary alcalde might cherish in his heart\r\nsome spark of honour, some lingering love of justice, there were\r\ntwo elements in the country to extinguish that spark, to smother\r\nthat feeling.\r\n\r\nWoe betide the alcalde who would decide a case, whatever its merits,\r\nadversely to any one of the religious orders. I personally knew\r\nan alcalde who (at a great price) had obtained the government of\r\nthe province of Batangas, from whence his immediate predecessor,\r\nalso well-known to me, had retired with a large fortune, but leaving\r\neverybody contented so far as could be seen. He had kept on good terms\r\nwith the priests. His successor unfortunately forgot this cardinal rule\r\nand allowed himself to be identified with some anti-clerical Spaniards.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of trouble fell upon that man, and finally he was recalled\r\nto Manila and received a severe reprimand from General Primo de Rivera,\r\nwho was said to have received $12,000 for turning him out.\r\n\r\nHe was removed from wealthy Batangas and sent to the fever-stricken\r\ncapital of Tayabas, a wretchedly poor Government, affording few\r\nopportunities for peculation. He escaped with his life, but his wife, a\r\nvery charming Spanish lady, succumbed to the malaria. Similar instances\r\nof the results of being, or being thought to be, an anti-clerical,\r\nwill occur to old residents in the Philippines. The arm of the Church\r\nwas long and its hand was a heavy one.\r\n\r\nThe second influence I referred to is the presence of the heathen\r\nChinee in the islands. To a Chinaman the idea that a judge should\r\ntake bribes seems as natural a thing as that a duck should take to\r\nthe water. And yet the Chinaman will not, unless he knows he is on the\r\nright track, brutally push his bribe under the judge's nose. Either he\r\nor one of his countrymen will from the judge's arrival have rendered\r\nhim good service. Does the judge want a gardener or cook? Ah-sin soon\r\nprovides an excellent one who never asks for his wages. Have some\r\nvisitors arrived at the Alcaldia Ah-sin sends in a dozen chickens,\r\na turkey, and the best fruits. Is it the judge's name-day? The wily\r\nCelestial presents a few cases of wine and boxes of fine cigars. Is\r\nthe roof of the Alcaldia leaking--a couple of Chinese carpenters will\r\nset it right without sending a bill for it. Then, having prepared the\r\nway, should Ah-sin be summoned before the alcalde, he may confidently\r\nhope that his patron will not hurriedly give judgment against him, and\r\nthat he will probably get a full opportunity to present substantial\r\nreasons why the suit should be decided in his favour. In fact, the\r\npractice of the alcalde's courts was only a shade better than that of\r\nthe Chinese Yamens, where the different cases are put up to auction\r\namongst the magistrates and knocked down to the highest bidders, who\r\nthen proceed on a course of extortion, by arrest and by the torture\r\nof witnesses, to make all they can out of them.\r\n\r\nIn an alcalde's court, there would be several mestizo or native writers\r\nor auxiliaries. Some of them were what is called meritorios, that is,\r\nunpaid volunteers. Of course, they expect to receive gratuities from\r\nthe suitors and would take care to mislay their documents if they were\r\nneglected. Sometimes the alcalde was so lazy that he left the whole\r\nmatter in the hands of his subordinates and signed whatever they laid\r\nbefore him. I have been a witness of this, and have even remonstrated\r\nwith a judge for so doing. He, however, said he had the greatest\r\nconfidence in his subordinates and that they dare not deceive him.\r\n\r\nBad as the alcalde's courts were, I think that the culminating point\r\nof corruption was the Audiencia of Manila. Escribano, abogado, juez,\r\nauditor, fiscal, vied with each other in showing that to them, honour\r\nand dignity were mere empty words. They set the vilest examples to\r\nthe mestizos and natives, and, unfortunately, these have been only\r\ntoo apt pupils, and having little to lose, were often ready to go one\r\nbetter than the Spaniards, who after all had to keep up appearances. I\r\ncannot adequately express the loathing I feel for all this tribe. I\r\nlook upon a highwayman as a gentleman compared to them, for he does\r\nrisk his life, and you may get a shot at him, but these wretches ruin\r\nyou in perfect safety.\r\n\r\nThey dress their wives, they nourish their children, upon the reward\r\nof roguery, the price of perjury, the fruits of forgery, the wages\r\nof some wicked judgment.\r\n\r\nWhat can be expected of the spawn of these reptiles, what but by the\r\nprocess of evolution to be more envenomed than their progenitors? Is\r\nthere not amongst all the multitudinous Philippines some desert\r\nisland where the people trained in the Spanish courts and all their\r\nbreed could be deported, where they might set up a court, and bring\r\nactions against each other and cheat and lie and forge till they die?\r\n\r\nWhat a Godsend for the Philippines were this possible, if besides\r\ngetting rid of the Spanish judges, they could now get rid of their\r\naiders and abettors, their apt pupils and would-be successors.\r\n\r\nBribery is a fine art, and there were those in Manila who were well\r\nversed in its intricacies. We heard one day of a decree by a judge\r\nagainst the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Club gossip\r\nasserted that the judge who issued the decree had lost some hundreds of\r\ndollars at the gambling table of the Casino the night before, and that\r\nthe artistic corrupter had called on him in the morning with the means\r\nto pay the debt of honour and to try his luck again. The judge was\r\nknown not to have the means of paying, yet he paid and simultaneously\r\nissued his decree. Old Manila hands drew their inference.\r\n\r\nThe record of these courts from the earliest times is one\r\nlong-continued infamy. Thank God that is over and a new chapter has\r\nbegun. I rejoice exceedingly that their sins have at last overtaken\r\nthem, and I recognise that, though\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"The mills of God grind slowly,\r\n                Yet they grind exceeding small.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the demoralisation of the mestizo and native lawyers by these\r\nvile examples, it will be very difficult to break the traditions of\r\nvenality and to find men worthy to occupy the bench.\r\n\r\nThese courts were not only corrupt, but they were inept. At a time\r\nwhen brigandage prevailed and many notorious criminals were apprehended\r\nalmost red-handed, convictions could not be got, and the bandits were\r\nliberated on various pretexts.\r\n\r\nSo great was the scandal that Moriones issued a decree that all persons\r\naccused of gang-robbery should be tried by a military tribunal. And\r\nhe appointed a permanent court-martial for this purpose, to the\r\ngreat disgust of all the lawyer element. These courts were abolished\r\nsome years later after his return to Spain; then the Guardia Civil\r\nmade their own arrangements, and the mortality amongst bandits was\r\nexcessive. When some well-known robber was by any chance taken alive,\r\nhe always, so they said, tried to escape by running away from his\r\ncaptors, and this obliged them to fire upon him. They never missed\r\non these occasions, and it was thought that the range never exceeded\r\nten paces and was often less.\r\n\r\nHowever necessary this military action may be, it is, undoubtedly\r\nliable to abuse, and the power of life and death is a great one to\r\nput in the hands of a junior officer or non-commissioned officer of\r\npolice. The Guardia Civil, an armed force with Spanish officers and\r\nnative soldiers, was organised in 1867, and I must say that I looked\r\nupon it as an excellent institution, the terror of evil-doers and a\r\nprotection to all law-abiding people. My native friends, however, are\r\nof a different opinion. They accuse the Guardia Civil, both Spaniards\r\nand natives, of behaving in an arbitrary and cruel manner, and with\r\npractising extortion upon defenceless natives. They are accused of\r\ntorturing witnesses to extort evidence, and this charge was no doubt\r\ntrue in many cases.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bandits or tulisanes were exterminated by this\r\ncorps of picked men, and security to life and property was assured. At\r\nthe formation of this corps the officers and men were very carefully\r\nselected. The Governor-General himself examined the records of every\r\nofficer, and only Spanish gentlemen of the highest character were\r\nappointed. Similarly the soldiers were natives who had served their\r\ntime in the army without having a crime noted against them. But in\r\nlater years this precaution was relaxed, and colonels of regiments\r\nwere allowed to dump their rubbish into this corps.\r\n\r\nI knew of a case where a Filipino with Irish blood in him was posted\r\nas a lieutenant to this corps and behaved most abominably. I am\r\nglad to say, however, that he was sent out of the islands. This was\r\nonly another instance of the fact that whatever the natives have to\r\ncomplain of the Spaniards, the mestizos, and their own rich people,\r\ntreat them and have always treated them far worse.\r\n\r\nBoth officers and men were well paid and were dressed in a very\r\nsmart and neat uniform, well suited to the climate, which they kept\r\nspick and span whatever service they were on. They were armed with\r\nRemington rifles and bayonets, and in addition carried a heavy chopping\r\nknife. They were posted at all the chief towns of Luzon and in some\r\nof the Visayas Islands. The greatest crime a native could commit\r\nwas to kill a Guardia Civil, and such a matter never came before a\r\nCivil Court. If the slayer by any chance was not killed on the spot,\r\nhe would probably be shot at sight. If apprehended, he would be tried\r\nby a court-martial composed of officers of the Guardia Civil, and,\r\nneedless to say, there would be no monkeying with the verdict nor\r\nwith the sentence, which would be promptly carried out.\r\n\r\nEven to resist the Guardia Civil was so great a crime that the\r\nsentence of a court-martial in such a case was penal servitude for life\r\n(Cadena Perpetua).\r\n\r\nHow surprised a London rough would be at this severity after being\r\naccustomed to expiate the most brutal assaults upon the police by a\r\nfine of a few shillings.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the Guardia Civil, I may say that their practice was\r\ncomprised in five memorable words, addressed to a similar corps\r\nby Mr. A. J. Balfour in his energetic days, a most sensible order,\r\nthat he may well be proud of: \"Do not hesitate to shoot.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst other duties of the Guardia Civil in bygone years was the\r\nmaking of periodical expeditions against the remontados and the hill\r\ntribes, officially designated Talas, or cuttings down.\r\n\r\nAt certain favourable seasons of the year, especially before harvest\r\ntime, the Guardias, accompanied by some Cuadrilleros, and on important\r\noccasions by a company of native infantry, marched up into the more\r\naccessible hills.\r\n\r\nThe hill-men obstructed the tracks in the most difficult places by\r\ncutting down trees and making abattis.\r\n\r\nThey also placed sharp bamboo spikes carefully concealed in the earth\r\nor mud of the footpaths, and these, if trodden on, inflicted most\r\ndangerous wounds that were apt to gangrene. Sometimes if they had\r\nmuch at stake, the hill-men or outlaws would venture an ambuscade, and\r\nhurl their javelins or send a flight of arrows amongst their enemies.\r\n\r\nBut even the boldest races rarely came to close quarters, for their\r\nweapons were no match against rifles and bayonets. So, led by their\r\nspies, the Spanish forces laboured upwards, and on arriving at the\r\nhamlets of the mountaineers or outlaws they burnt down the rude\r\nhuts, reaped the crops, taking away what they could and burning\r\nthe remainder.\r\n\r\nThey cut down every fruit tree and took special care to destroy every\r\ntobacco plant. They then retired, leaving a scene of devastation\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nIf any of the hill-men fell into their hands their fate depended upon\r\nwhether there were any murders to avenge or upon the humanity of the\r\nofficer in command. This wanton destruction was committed chiefly in\r\nthe interests of the tobacco monopoly, but also in order to force\r\nthe hillmen to come down and reside in the towns. It had, however,\r\nan entirely contrary effect, for the savages either retired into more\r\ninaccessible regions, or perhaps abandoned cultivation and lived a\r\nroving, marauding life like the Itetapanes and Catubanganes.\r\n\r\nSince the abolition of the tobacco monopoly the Talas have been less\r\nfrequent, and there was a feeling amongst the authorities that these\r\ncruel and demoralising expeditions should be discontinued, unless in\r\ncases where the hill-men had given great provocation.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards are, of course, not the only nation to make these\r\nforays. In the last campaign against the Afridis the British\r\ntroops were employed, under orders, to blow up the houses, break the\r\nmill-stones, and cut down the trees of the enemy, not even sparing the\r\nshade trees round a mosque. It was probably the only way to inflict\r\npunishment on the Afridis.\r\n\r\nThe worst feature is that in all such cases a crop of bitter hatred\r\nis sown in the hearts of the sufferers, which matures later on,\r\nand which is handed down from one generation to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTAGAL CRIME AND SPANISH JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n    The murder of a Spaniard--Promptitude of the Courts--The case of\r\n    Juan de la Cruz--Twelve years in prison waiting trial--Piratical\r\n    outrage in Luzon--Culprits never tried; several die in prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe penal code of the Philippines, which came into force in 1884,\r\ndeclares it impossible to consider as an aggravation of an offence the\r\ncircumstance of colour or race in the offender, for the criminal is\r\nto be punished for his crime and not for the condition of inferiority\r\nto which nature has condemned him.\r\n\r\nIt goes on to say that on the other hand his condition should not\r\nbe allowed to attenuate the sentence, for that would constitute an\r\nodious privilege, an unbearable inequality.\r\n\r\nIt therefore proudly proclaims the equality of all races before the\r\nlaw. These are noble words; we shall see how they work out in practice.\r\n\r\nThe case of Juan de la Cruz shows us that a criminal investigation\r\ncan drag on for twelve years without coming on for trial when the\r\nvictims are natives and of lowly station. I could cite cases where the\r\nvictims were British subjects, and the murderers were never punished,\r\nand another case where a Frenchman was the victim. The murderer\r\nin this case was to have been pardoned by the Governor-General,\r\nbut the French consul threatened to haul down his flag and leave\r\nthe islands unless the assassin was executed; and he was executed,\r\nthe consul attending to see the sentence carried out\r\n\r\nThe British Foreign Office does not encourage its agents to such\r\nenergetic acts. To obtain the good graces of the Foreign Office a\r\nconsul should be devoid of talent or originality. Mediocrity is the\r\ncondition sought for. It is never advisable for one of Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's consuls to be active in protecting Her Britannic Majesty's\r\nsubjects. What he must aim at if he wishes for consideration and\r\npromotion is to give the Foreign Office no trouble. The ideal consul\r\nwould be he who is only heard of once a quarter, when he certifies\r\nthat he is alive, and asks that his salary may be paid.\r\n\r\nI will relate a murder that made an impression on me at the time,\r\nwhere the victim was a Spaniard. In June of 1881, I was at Santa\r\nCruz in the Laguna Province for several days, making experiments\r\nwith some patent centrifugals, steaming and drying the fine Laguna\r\nsugar. Quite close to the camarin, where the machines were at work,\r\nlived an elderly Spaniard who was a government employe in some\r\nsubordinate position. I think he was the Subdelegado de Hacienda,\r\nor sub-provincial treasurer. I had once or twice called upon the old\r\ngentleman, whose appearance and manners were above his official rank,\r\nand had been politely received by him. On completing my experiments,\r\nI called to take leave of him, and was sorry to find him suffering\r\nfrom fever, and very weak.\r\n\r\nI returned to Manila, and next day was horrified to read in a newspaper\r\nthat he had been murdered in the night by his two servants. This\r\natrocious crime, committed on a helpless and infirm old man, with every\r\ncircumstance of premeditation and barbarity, and with the object of\r\nrobbery, roused the indignation of every European. The culprits were\r\nsoon apprehended, and such expedition was used by the Promotor Fiscal\r\nand the court, that within a week from the perpetration of the murder\r\nthe two servants were garrotted on a scaffold erected near the scene\r\nof their barbarous crime.\r\n\r\nSuch is the rapidity with which the Philippine courts could act when\r\na Spaniard was the victim and when public opinion was deeply stirred\r\nby some shocking tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case of Juan de la Cruz.\r\n\r\nThe following narrative of events, which occurred in 1886, will give\r\nthe reader a good idea of the furious passions that may lurk under\r\nthe inscrutable features of the Philippine Malay, and will also serve\r\nto illustrate the procedure of the Spanish criminal courts when the\r\nvictims are natives and when nothing can be made out of the case. Four\r\nof the five actors or victims in the tragedy were well known to me,\r\nand I learned all the particulars at first hand and at the time,\r\nfrom those who took steps to deliver over the culprit to justice.\r\n\r\nThe decked steam launch Laguimanoc belonged to Gustav Brown, a ship\r\ncarpenter, and was hired by the Varadero, or Slipway Company of\r\nCanacao, near Cavite, to keep up communication with Manila, whilst\r\nthe slip was being constructed.\r\n\r\nI was consulting engineer to the company, and Mr. J. L. Houston was\r\nthe resident engineer in charge of the work. Both of us made frequent\r\nvoyages in this launch between Canacao and Manila. The crew consisted\r\nof a patron (coxswain) named Juan de la Cruz, an engine-driver,\r\na stoker, and a boy, all Tagals.\r\n\r\nJuan de la Cruz was an elderly man with grey hair, and in figure thin\r\nand wiry. He was a good man at his duty, one of the silent Indians\r\nwhom I have always found to be the best. A thorough sailor, he had\r\nserved under many a flag, and sailed o'er many a sea, both in tropic\r\nand in northern climes.\r\n\r\nThe engine-driver and the stoker were brothers, strong and well-built\r\nyoung fellows, and smart at their work. The boy was an active lad,\r\nquite pleased to be employed on a steam-boat.\r\n\r\nOne day, the stoker, going through the blacksmith's shop, saw a piece\r\nof square steel, which had been cut off a long bar, lying on the\r\nfloor, and it struck him that it would be better than a hammer for\r\nbreaking coal. So he annexed it without leave, and got one end drawn\r\nout and rounded so that he could easily hold it. This made a very\r\nefficient coal-breaker, the sharp edges divided the lumps with great\r\nease. It was about eighteen inches long, and one and three-quarter\r\ninches square. The patron was married, and his wife lived in Manila,\r\nbut, sailor-like, he had provided himself with a sweetheart, at the\r\nother end of his run, where he spent more time than in the Pasig,\r\nand had become intimate with a damsel of San Roque, a village between\r\nthe Varadero and Cavite. Things went on apparently all right for some\r\ntime; the launch making almost daily trips between Canacao and Manila,\r\nand the elderly patron alternating between the conjugal domicile and\r\nthe dwelling of his mistress. She was young, and, as native girls go,\r\na pretty woman. Come of a strange and unknown mixture of races, and\r\nbred up amongst a community noted for its profligacy, she knew how\r\nto make the best use of her charms and was well fitted to captivate\r\nthe weather-beaten seaman.\r\n\r\nHe, if not desirable in himself, held a well paid post, and was able\r\nto place her above want.\r\n\r\nAlready fifty years old, he was as susceptible as a youth and far more\r\nin earnest. Day by day, as he basked in her smiles, his infatuation\r\nincreased till he became violently enamoured of his charmer.\r\n\r\nWhat could be more natural than that the crew of the launch should\r\nbecome acquainted with the patron's mistress? Soon the engine-driver\r\nand the stoker were her constant visitors. The damsel had a kind word\r\nand a smile for both, and doubtless contrasted their vigorous youth\r\nand shapely forms with the shrunken figure of her elderly protector,\r\nand their lively conversation with his glum silence.\r\n\r\nIn the end, no doubt, the damsel refused them nothing.\r\n\r\nTrouble was now brewing. The grim sailor was not the man to let\r\nhimself be wronged with impunity. All the elements of a tragedy were\r\npresent. Things no longer went smoothly on board the Laguimanoc, and\r\nher voyages lost their regularity. Something was perpetually going\r\nwrong with the engines, pieces or fittings disappeared unaccountably,\r\nusually pieces of copper or brass. The engine-driver was blamed,\r\nbut he succeeded in averting his impending discharge. Could he\r\nhave foreseen the consequences of remaining, he would have promptly\r\ndischarged himself.\r\n\r\nOn board the launch mutual distrust prevailed. The engine-driver must\r\nhave known that it was the patron who had thrown overboard the fittings\r\nin his absence, hoping to get him discharged, but he held his peace.\r\n\r\nThe silent figure at the tiller made no sign; no trace of emotion\r\ncould be seen on the Sphinx-like face, no reproaches passed his lips,\r\nnot the slightest manifestation of resentment. But underneath that\r\nimperturbable calm there existed the steadfast determination to have\r\na full and bloody revenge on all who had offended him. The Laguimanoc\r\nmade a voyage to Manila one Saturday to take up the resident engineer\r\nwho often spent his Sundays there, the launch remaining in the\r\nriver. On Monday morning when he came down to the launch he found\r\nthat the safety valve was missing from its seat, and was delayed till\r\nanother could be procured.\r\n\r\nNo explanations of the loss of this piece could be got, and the\r\nLaguimanoc proceeded with the resident engineer to Canacao and made\r\nfast to the jetty.\r\n\r\nA crisis was now reached. The abstraction of the safety-valve could\r\nnot be overlooked, and some one would have to go. An inquiry was\r\nto be made, but on Tuesday morning the patron walked up the jetty,\r\nand reported to Mr. Gustav Brown, who was the foreman of the works,\r\nthat the engine-driver and stoker were absent. He stated that they\r\nhad gone ashore in the night, and had not returned. Nothing could\r\nbe learned about them; nobody had seen them; their kits were still\r\non board. As the day wore on they did not come nor send any message;\r\nso a report of their disappearance was sent to the judge at Cavite.\r\n\r\nAn engine-fitter from the works was sent on board to take charge\r\nof the engine, and another stoker was engaged; the launch resuming\r\nher running. The work of the Varadero proceeded as usual; divers\r\nwere preparing the foundations to receive the immense gridiron\r\nwhich was shortly to be launched and sunk in place. It was a busy\r\nscene of organised labour under a skilful resident engineer; every\r\ndifficulty foreseen and provided for, materials delivered in good time,\r\nnotwithstanding obstructions; not an unnecessary auger-hole bored,\r\nnot a stroke of an adze thrown away.\r\n\r\nFrom the Sleepy Hollow of the naval arsenal opposite jealous eyes\r\nwatched the work proceed. Every art of vexation and obstruction that\r\nbitter envy could devise had for years been employed to prevent\r\nthe building of this slip, and onerous and unfair conditions had\r\nbeen inserted in the concession. But Anglo-American persistence and\r\nindustry had succeeded so far, and in the hands of Messrs. Peel,\r\nHubbell & Co. and their advisers, the work was now well advanced.\r\n\r\nThe obsolete corvette Dona Maria Molina was moored off the\r\ncoaling-wharf adjoining the Varadero, and when one of her boats was\r\ngoing on shore the sailors noticed two dead bodies floating in the\r\nwater, and reported this to the officer of the watch, who ordered\r\nthem to tow the bodies to the shore towards Punta Sangley, and drag\r\nthem up on the sand above high-water mark. The bodies were lashed\r\ntogether with a piece of new rope having a blue strand in the centre,\r\nand had a good-sized piece of white granite attached as a sinker. On\r\nlooking at the lashings no one could doubt that the work had been\r\ndone by an able seaman. The bodies presented ghastly wounds, both had\r\nfractures of the skull, and gaping cuts on the throat and abdomen;\r\nthey had also been gnawed by fishes. The swelling of the bodies had\r\nsufficed to bring them to the surface, stone and all.\r\n\r\nThe news of the finding of the corpses did not immediately reach\r\nthe Varadero, and they were conveyed to Cavite, and buried just as\r\nthey were found, tied together with the ropes and stone, without\r\nbeing identified. It seemed nobody's business to trouble about them,\r\nnotwithstanding the evident fact that they had been murdered. The\r\nManila newspapers did not mention the circumstance.\r\n\r\nBut at this time other events happened. The patron of the launch\r\ndisappeared without taking his kit with him. Then the boy disappeared,\r\nand I may as well at once say that, from that time to this, that\r\nboy has never been heard of by the Varadero Company, who were his\r\nemployers. Next, that gay and lascivious damsel of San Roque, whose\r\nunbridled sensuality had wrought the trouble, also disappeared as\r\nmysteriously as the others.\r\n\r\nDr. Juan Perez, of Cavite, was the medical attendant to the staff\r\nof the Varadero, and used to call there every afternoon. On hearing\r\nfrom him about the discovery of the bodies, the resident engineer\r\nat once thought of his missing men, and the flight of the patron\r\nconfirmed his suspicions. A minute examination of the launch was\r\nmade, and revealed some stains of blood which had not been entirely\r\nremoved by the usual washing down. Several small cuts such as might\r\nbe made with the point of a bolo were found in the flat skylight\r\nof the cabin, and a deeper cut on the bulwark rail, starboard side\r\nforward, opposite the skylight. A working rope was missing from the\r\nlaunch. It had only recently been supplied to it, and had been cut\r\noff a whole coil purchased a few weeks before from a sailing-vessel,\r\nfor the use of the Varadero. That rope had a blue strand in the\r\ncentre. Gustav Brown put on a diving-dress, and went down at the head\r\nof the northern jetty, where the launch used to lie, and carefully\r\nexamined the bottom. Presently his eye rested on an object that he\r\nrecognised. It was the square steel coal-breaker used by the stoker,\r\nand he brought it up.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a new coxswain had been found for the launch, and as the\r\nold patron had left his vessel illegally, there was ground for his\r\narrest on that score, so orders were given to the new patron and\r\nto the engine-driver to give him into custody if he came to claim\r\nhis kit. Next time the launch arrived in Manila, sure enough the\r\nold patron appeared to fetch his belongings, and was taken to the\r\ncalaboose of the captain of the port. The resident engineer called on\r\nthat official, and, as a result of their conversation, the prisoner\r\nwas put on board the launch to be conveyed to Cavite.\r\n\r\nWith all the stoicism of the Malay, he sat quite still and silent;\r\nhis impassive features betrayed no sign of anxiety or remorse.\r\n\r\nBut if the principal actor in this bloody tragedy could thus compose\r\nhis mind, it was not so with others who knew more or less what had\r\nhappened, but whose dread and hatred of the law and its myrmidons\r\nhad kept their tongues quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen the launch approached the Varadero near enough for the prisoner\r\nto be recognised, an unusual commotion occurred amongst the swarm of\r\nnative workmen. A mysterious magnetism, an inexplicable vibration,\r\npervaded the crowd. Unfelt by the senses, it acted on the mind, and\r\nseemed simultaneously to convey to each individual an identical idea.\r\n\r\nThe patron was a prisoner, therefore his crime was known; no good\r\ncould be done by keeping silent. Before this nobody knew anything\r\nabout the disappearance of the two men. Now it leaked out, but only in\r\nconfidence to Gustav Brown, whom they trusted. The native divers had\r\nseen the bodies when at their work on the foundations, and had moved\r\nthem farther off out of their way. Men working at the jetties had seen\r\nthem when they floated, but had looked in another direction. In fact,\r\nthe corpses had been recognised, and the crime was known to scores\r\nof native and Chinese workmen, but no word or hint ever reached the\r\nforeman or the engineer till the culprit was arrested.\r\n\r\nNow there were sufficient details to reconstitute the tragic scene.\r\n\r\nThe amour of the brothers with the San Roque girl was known, and also\r\nthe well-founded jealousy of the patron, who at first endeavoured\r\nto obtain the engine-driver's discharge by the means already\r\nmentioned. This not succeeding, he determined to kill both of them,\r\nand without showing a sign of the deadly hatred that possessed him,\r\ncalmly awaited his opportunity.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday night, 7th June, after the incident of the safety-valve,\r\nthe launch was moored alongside the Varadero jetty, and the two\r\nbrothers lay fast asleep on the flat top of the cabin skylight,\r\neach wrapped in his blanket.\r\n\r\nA native sleeps hard, and is not easily awakened, nor when aroused\r\ndoes he quickly regain his faculties. It is an important point in\r\nthe Malay code of manners never to awaken any person suddenly, for\r\nit is believed that, during sleep, the soul is absent from the body,\r\nwandering around, and must be given time to return, otherwise serious,\r\neven fatal consequences, may ensue. The awakened person may become\r\nan idiot, or some great harm may happen to the unmannerly one who\r\nawakened him. Many natives have as great a fear of the wandering\r\nsoul of a sleeping person as of an evil spirit or ghost. The soul\r\nis said to return to the body in the form of a small black ball,\r\nwhich enters the mouth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, one of the greatest, in fact, the most terrible, curse that\r\ncan be uttered by many tribes, is, \"May you die sleeping,\" for it\r\nmeans death to body and soul. That, however, was the fate reserved for\r\nthe brothers. Towards midnight, when the cooking-fires in the coolie\r\nquarters had burnt down, and the chatter of the Chinese had subsided,\r\nwhen the last lights in the Europeans' houses had been extinguished,\r\nand not a sound broke the stillness of the night, the patron addressed\r\nhimself to the performance of his bloody task. Slipping his sharpened\r\nbolo through his belt, he descended into the engine-room, and, seizing\r\nthe coal-breaker, crept forward to where the doomed men slumbered,\r\nperhaps dreaming of the charms of that dark damsel, the enjoyment\r\nof whose embraces was to cost them so dear. Meanwhile, their fate\r\napproached; their time was come.\r\n\r\nThe patron was past his prime; privations at sea and dissipation on\r\nshore had sapped his strength. But bitter hatred nerving his arm,\r\nwith lightning rapidity and terrific force he discharged a blow on\r\neach sleeper's unprotected head. The sharp edge of the steel bar\r\ncrashed deep into their skulls, driving in the splintered bone upon\r\nthe brain. One agonised shudder from each, then all was still. A\r\nEuropean murderer might have been satisfied with this. Not so a\r\nTagal. A ceremony still remained to be accomplished. Their blood must\r\nflow; they must suffer mutilation. Seizing his bolo, the assassin now\r\nvented his rage in cutting and thrusting at the bodies. The heavy\r\nand keen-edged blade fell repeatedly, cutting great gashes on the\r\nthroats and bellies of the victims, whilst streams of gore ran down\r\nthe waterways, and trickled out at the scuppers, staining the white\r\nsides of the launch with crimson streaks.\r\n\r\nHis blood-thirst assuaged, his vengeance partly accomplished, and\r\nhis spirit comforted by his desperate deed, the murderer probably\r\npaused for a time, and began to consider how he could conceal his\r\ncrime. No sign of movement anywhere. Apparently the dull sounds of the\r\nblows had fallen on no mortal ear. Presently, taking up one of his\r\nworking ropes, he mounted the jetty, and walked to the shore, where\r\nthere lay a pile of stone ballast. It was white granite, discharged\r\nfrom a sailing-ship that had come from Hong Kong in ballast, and it\r\nhad been purchased for the Varadero. Selecting a suitable piece,\r\nhe carried it to the end of the jetty, and lowered it by the rope\r\ninto the launch. Then, descending, he firmly lashed the two bodies\r\ntogether, and fastened the stone to them. Then he drew the bodies to\r\nthe side, preparatory to launching them overboard. Now an incident\r\noccurred. It is thought that one of the two men was not quite dead,\r\nnotwithstanding his dreadful wounds, and that recovering consciousness,\r\nand perceiving what awaited him, seized the rail in his death-grasp,\r\nand resisted the attempt to throw him over.\r\n\r\nThe patron must once again have had recourse to his murderous bolo,\r\nbringing it down on the clenched hand, for a deep cut was found on\r\nthe rail with blood driven into the pores of the wood by that savage\r\nblow. The tendons severed, the hand unclasped, and next moment the\r\nbodies slid over the rail and down underneath the keel of the launch in\r\nsome four fathoms of water. Throwing the steel coal-breaker after them,\r\nthe patron's next task was to wash away the traces of his crime, and\r\nthis he did fairly well so that nothing was noticed, till, suspicion\r\nbeing aroused, a careful scrutiny was made, with the result already\r\nmentioned. It is not known whether the boy knew anything of the tragedy\r\nperformed so near him, for he was never questioned, having apparently\r\ndisappeared off the face of the earth as soon as the bodies were\r\nfound. What the patron did afterwards can only be conjectured. Guilty\r\nof two atrocious murders, and of savage mutilation of the slain,\r\ncould he have composed himself to a quiet and dreamless slumber? Or\r\nwas his imagination fired to further revenge by dream-pictures of his\r\nonce-loved mistress in the arms of her youthful lovers? All that is\r\nknown is that he presented himself to the foreman early on the Tuesday\r\nmorning, and reported the absence of the two men without showing on\r\nhis dark visage the slightest sign of trouble or emotion.\r\n\r\nWe left the patron a prisoner on the launch. Now it became\r\nnecessary to give him in charge to the judicial authorities, for\r\nit was getting late in the afternoon. They did not show any undue\r\neagerness to receive him. The judge first applied to explained that\r\nhe was only acting temporarily, that the judge had departed, having\r\nbeen transferred to another place, and that the new judge had not\r\nyet arrived, therefore he much regretted he could not take up the\r\ncase. An appeal was then made to the Gobernador-Politico-Militar, who\r\nmost courteously explained that a civil court was established in the\r\nprovince with full jurisdiction, both criminal and civil, so that he\r\ncould not interfere. It was now nearly sunset, and the prisoner had\r\nbeen on the launch all day. The resident engineer then called on the\r\nCommandante of Canacao--a naval officer who had a few marines at his\r\ndisposal--and obtained as a personal favour that the prisoner should\r\nbe temporarily secured in the guard-room. The next day the resident\r\nengineer proceeded to Cavite, and, accompanied by Dr. Juan Perez,\r\nvisited the principal authorities, and eventually succeeded in getting\r\nthe prisoner lodged in jail, and a charge of murder entered against\r\nhim. The bodies of the victims were never exhumed for examination. The\r\nresident engineer made a declaration, which was taken down in writing,\r\nand on one of his busiest days he was peremptorily summoned to appear\r\nbefore the judge, and solemnly ratify his testimony.\r\n\r\nAbout three days after Juan de la Cruz was lodged in Cavite jail,\r\nthe dead body of the San Roque damsel, gashed by savage blows of the\r\nfatal bolo, was left by the ebb on the sands of Paranaque, a village\r\njust across the little Bay of Bacoor opposite to San Roque. She had\r\npaid with her life for her frailty as many another woman has done in\r\nevery clime. From the appearance of the body it was thought it had\r\nbeen several days in the water.\r\n\r\nNo legal evidence was forthcoming to fix the crime on any one,\r\nalthough few of those who knew the story harboured a doubt that the\r\nassassin of the two brothers was the murderer of the girl also.\r\n\r\nJuan de la Cruz remained in prison, and from time to time, but with\r\nincreasing intervals, the resident engineer, the foreman and others\r\nwere cited by the judge, interrogated, then cited again to ratify\r\ntheir declarations.\r\n\r\nThe espediente, a pile of stamped paper, grew thicker and thicker,\r\nbut the trial seemed no nearer. Month after month rolled on, the\r\nVaradero was finished, ships were drawn up, repaired and launched,\r\nJuan continued in prison.\r\n\r\nThe resident engineer departed to other climes, and was soon expending\r\nhis energy in building the great harbour at La Guayra. I was the means\r\nof obtaining an order for six gun-boats for the Varadero Company. They\r\nwere built, launched, tried and delivered, and steamed away to overawe\r\nthe piratical Moros. Still Juan continued in prison. Judges came and\r\njudges went, but the trial came no nearer. Year after year a judge\r\nof the Audiencia came in state to inspect the prisoners, and year\r\nafter year Juan was set down as awaiting his trial.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1892, I left the Philippines for Cuba and Juan de la\r\nCruz was still in Cavite jail.\r\n\r\nDr. Juan Perez, the surgeon who had examined the corpses, died, having\r\nwrongly diagnosed his own case, and Dr. Hugo Perez, a half caste,\r\nwas appointed in his stead. Gustav Brown, the foreman, wearied of the\r\nmonotony of ship repairing, became possessed by a longing to resume his\r\nnomadic life amongst the palm-clad islands of the Pacific. He purchased\r\na schooner and embarked with his wife and family. First running down\r\nto Singapore to take in trade-goods for bartering with the natives,\r\nhe sailed away for the Carolines where his wife's home lay. He never\r\nreached them; for, soon after leaving Singapore, he came to a bloody\r\nend at the hands of his Chinese crew, who killed and decapitated him.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection broke out in Cavite Province, Colonel Mattone's column\r\nwas defeated by the insurgents with great slaughter. Dr. Hugo Perez,\r\nthe successor of Dr. Juan Perez, was suspected of sympathising with\r\nthe rebels, and, needless to say, he soon came to a bloody end. He\r\ndid not have to wait long for his trial.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, Mr. George Gilchrist, the engineer at the Varadero, who was\r\nnot in the Philippines when the murders were committed, was cited by\r\nthe judge, and asked if he could identify the prisoner ten years after\r\nhis arrest! Two years more passed, and in April, 1898, Mr. Gilchrist\r\nreturned to Scotland for a well-earned holiday. When he left Canacao,\r\nJuan de la Cruz was still in prison awaiting his trial.\r\n\r\nHe may have escaped when the rebels occupied Cavite after Admiral\r\nDewey's victory over the Spanish Squadron in the Bay of Bacoor.\r\n\r\nFor the murderer no pity need be felt, he certainly had nothing to\r\ngain and all to lose by a trial. A double murder, premeditated,\r\naccompanied by acts of great barbarity, and committed at night,\r\nconstitutes by the Penal Code a capital offence with three aggravating\r\ncircumstances which would forbid all hope of clemency.\r\n\r\nBut what can be thought of courts so remiss in their duty? How many\r\ninnocent prisoners have waited years for their trial? How many have\r\ndied in prison?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiratical Outrage in Luzon.\r\n\r\nAt Laguimanoc, a port and village in the Province of Tayabas, there\r\nresided an Englishman, Mr. H. G. Brown, who had been many years in\r\nthe Philippines. By the exercise of untiring industry, by braving\r\nthe malaria of the primeval forests, and by his never-failing tact in\r\ndealing with the officials of the Woods and Forests on the one hand,\r\nand with the semi-barbarous and entirely lawless wood-cutters on\r\nthe other, he had built up an extensive business in cutting timber\r\nin the state forests of Southern Luzon and the adjacent islands. He\r\nwas owner of several sailing vessels, had a well-appointed saw-mill,\r\nand a comfortable residence at Languimanoc. He employed large numbers\r\nof wood-cutters; all under advances of pay, who were scattered about\r\nthe Provinces of Tayabas, and Camarines Norte over a considerable area.\r\n\r\nHis business was so considerable that he paid the Government fully\r\n$30,000 per year as royalty on timber which was mostly shipped to\r\nHong Kong and Shanghai.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate a business so profitable to them the Government\r\nplaced a Custom House official at Atimonan, in the Bay of Lamon on\r\nthe Pacific coast, to clear and despatch his timber vessels loaded\r\nat Atimonan, Gumacas, Lopez, Alabat Island, or other places. To show\r\nhow little Mr. Brown spared himself, I may mention that not even\r\nthe dreaded jungle-fever of Mindoro prevented him from personally\r\nsuperintending the loading of several vessels at different ports of\r\nthat pestilential island. In persistence and pluck he was a worthy\r\npredecessor of Professor D. C. Worcester, who years afterwards showed\r\nhis Anglo-Saxon determination in the same fearsome spot.\r\n\r\nOne day in December of 1884, Mr. Brown being absent in Hong Kong,\r\nand his manager, Mr. Anderson, busy on the Pacific coast, looking\r\nafter the loading of a vessel, the out-door superintendent, a Swede\r\nnamed Alfred Olsen, was in charge of the house, office, and saw-mill\r\nat Laguimanoc, and was attending to the loading of the Tartar, one\r\nof Mr. Brown's ships which was anchored in the bay taking in timber\r\nfor China. She had a native crew who occasionally of an evening, when\r\nashore to enjoy themselves, got up a disturbance with the villagers. On\r\nboard this vessel there were, as is usual, two Carabineros or Custom\r\nHouse guards to prevent smuggling.\r\n\r\nAlthough no one in the village suspected it, two large canoes full of\r\narmed men were lying concealed behind a point in Capuluan Cove on the\r\nopposite side of the Bay. At eight o'clock in the evening, it being\r\nquite dark, they came across, and in perfect order, according to a\r\npre-arranged plan advanced in silence on the village. The assailants\r\nnumbered twenty-eight men, and were variously armed with lances, bolos\r\nand daggers. Only the leader bore a revolver. A guard was left on the\r\ncanoes, four of the gang were stationed at the door of Mr. Brown's\r\nhouse, and others at strategic points, whilst the main body attacked\r\nthe Tribunal close by which was also the estanco where there was some\r\nGovernment money, postage stamps and stamped paper. At all Tribunales\r\nthere are a couple of cuadrilleros, or village constables on guard,\r\narmed usually with lance and bolo. These men did their duty and\r\nmanfully resisted the pirates. In the combat which ensued, the sergeant\r\nof the Cuadrilleros was killed and some on both sides were wounded,\r\nbut the pirates got the best of the fight, and plundered the estanco.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Olsen, having heard the uproar, may have thought that\r\nthe crew of the Tartar were again making a disturbance. At all events\r\nhe left the house unarmed and unsuspicious, thus walking into the trap\r\nlaid for him. The Tagals have a great respect for fire-arms, more\r\nespecially for the revolvers and repeating rifles of the foreigner,\r\nthus they did not venture to enter the house, but the moment Olsen\r\nstepped out into the darkness and before he could see round about\r\nhim, he was attacked by two men on each side, who plunged their\r\ndaggers into his body, piercing his lungs. Bleeding profusely and\r\nvomiting blood he rushed back into the house towards his bedroom to\r\nget his revolver which was under the bed. His assailants, however,\r\nfollowed him into the room and butchered him before he could grasp\r\nit. At least the revolver was afterwards found in its case with the\r\nperfect impress of his blood-stained hand upon the oaken lid. A native\r\nboy named Pablo, about eight years old, was in the house at the time,\r\nand in his terror squeezed himself into a narrow space behind the door\r\nand escaped discovery, although he was an eye-witness of the crime.\r\n\r\nBy this time the alarm had spread all over the little village, and\r\nthe noise was heard on board the Tartar. The two Carabineros, taking\r\ntheir Remingtons and cartridge boxes, had themselves paddled on shore,\r\nand marching up the stairs which led to the rocky eminence on which\r\nthe village stands, bravely advanced against the pirates although\r\nout-numbered by more than ten to one. They fired their rifles,\r\nbut the gang rushed upon them and in a moment they were cut down,\r\nand according to Tagal custom, their bellies were ripped open. The\r\npirates having now overcome all opposition and having plundered\r\nthe estanco, and the inevitable Chinaman's shop, transferred their\r\nattention to Mr. Brown's house, which they ransacked, taking the\r\ncontents of the safe, a collection of gold and silver coins, seven\r\nMartini-Henry rifles with ammunition, and two revolvers, as well as\r\nany other things they deemed of value. They burst open the desks,\r\ndrawers, and wardrobes, cutting and hacking the furniture with their\r\nbolos in wanton mischief. Then embarking their spoil, they sailed\r\naway with the land breeze.\r\n\r\nInformation had been sent off to the nearest post of the Guardia Civil,\r\nand on its receipt, an officer with a force of that corps instantly\r\nset off and captured one party of the pirates red-handed as they\r\nbeached their canoe. Within a week twenty-six had been captured and\r\none shot dead whilst escaping. There only remained the leader. He,\r\nas it was afterwards discovered, was concealed in a secluded wood a\r\nfew miles from Sariaya, and one night he was speared by the Captain\r\nof Cuadrilleros of that town, who is said to have had valid reasons\r\nfor getting him out of the way.\r\n\r\nThis band of pirates were a mixed lot; some of them were principales or\r\nmembers of the town council of Sariaya, a picturesque little place on\r\nthe southern slope of Mount Banajao, and some from San Juan de Boc-boc;\r\nothers were ordinary inhabitants, a few were outlaws from the San Juan\r\nmountains, and four or five were fishermen whom the gang had met on\r\ntheir passage by sea and had invited to accompany them. This custom\r\nof Convites is explained in Chapter XXV. Of course the fishermen,\r\nwhen interrogated, declared they had been pressed into the service,\r\nbut in fact very few natives have the moral courage to decline so\r\npleasing an entertainment, as it appeals to a feeling deeply seated\r\nin their hearts, the love of rapine, only to be restrained by the\r\nheavy hand of a military police \"who do not hesitate to shoot.\" The\r\nprovincial doctor arrived next morning with the judge who was to take\r\nthe depositions of the villagers and draw up the sumario. Olsen was\r\ndead, the sergeant of Cuadrilleros also and one of the Carabineros,\r\nbut strange to say, in spite of a dozen ghastly wounds, the other\r\none was still alive, though his bowels were protruding, having fallen\r\nout through the gash which it is the Tagal custom to finish off with.\r\n\r\nWhen the provincial doctor saw him, he said, \"Nothing can possibly\r\nbe done for him,\" and departed. So, abandoned to his own resources,\r\nhe replaced the bowels himself, and getting one of the villagers to\r\nbind him up, he eventually recovered. He was seen by Mr. Brown a year\r\nor two later, and is probably alive now. This seems extraordinary, but\r\na similar case occurred to a man who had worked under me. An English\r\nbricklayer named John Heath had been employed building furnaces and\r\nkilns in Manila, and having completed his work, took to farming and\r\nrented some grass meadows (sacate lands) at Mandaloyan. One night he\r\nand another Englishman staying with him were attacked in his house by a\r\nparty of Tagals with drawn bolos. The visitor, although wounded, leaped\r\nfrom the window and escaped, but Heath was cut down, then lifted on to\r\nthe window sill, hacked about, and finally, according to Tagal custom,\r\nripped open and left for dead. Yet this man also entirely recovered,\r\nand after a year seemed as strong as ever, although he was advised\r\nnot to exert his strength. This outrage was clearly agrarian, and was,\r\nI feel sure, committed by those who had previously rented these lands\r\nand had been turned out. No one was ever punished for it.\r\n\r\nTo return to the gang of pirates; two had been killed, the rest were\r\nin prison. Year after year passed, still they remained in prison;\r\njudges came, stayed their term, were promoted and went, but still\r\nthese men were never sentenced.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, I visited Laguimanoc to make a plan and valuation of the\r\nproperty, as the business was about to be taken over by a Limited\r\nLiability Company, established in Hong Kong. This was five years after\r\nthe date of the murders, some of the prisoners had died in prison, the\r\nothers were awaiting their sentence. But I found that the Government\r\nhad established a sergeant's post of the Guardia Civil in the village,\r\nwhich effectually prevented a repetition of the outrage.\r\n\r\nA year later I again visited Laguimanoc, but the trial of the prisoners\r\nwas no further advanced. No less than nine of them died in prison,\r\nstill no sentence was pronounced. Even for a Philippine Court this\r\nwas extraordinary, for the gang had committed the unpardonable crime\r\n\"Resistencia a fuerza armada\" (Resistance to an armed force), and could\r\nhave been tried by Court-martial and summarily shot. They had also\r\ndared to lay their profane hands on the sacred money-box containing\r\na portion of the \"Real Haber\" (Government money), so that it was not\r\nonly a question of murder and robbery of private people. But the Civil\r\nCourt, negligent, slothful, and corrupt, could not be got to convict,\r\nand a few years ago, Mr. Brown having left the islands, the surviving\r\nprisoners were pardoned by the Queen Regent on the occasion of the\r\nyoung King's birthday.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the military and civil elements in this case is\r\nvery strong.\r\n\r\nThe military element performed its duties thoroughly well, under great\r\ndifficulties, and promptly arrested the malefactors. In my experience\r\nthis has been always the case, and I draw from it the conclusion\r\nthat military Government is essential to the pacification of the\r\nPhilippines and that authority must be backed up by a native force\r\nof constabulary under American officers who must be young and active.\r\n\r\nSuch offences as piracy or gang-robbery should never come before a\r\nCivil Court, but should be promptly settled by court-martial before\r\nwhich no technicalities or legal subtleties need be taken into account.\r\n\r\nA firm, nay, a heavy hand over the Philippines is the most merciful\r\nin the long run.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to have to relate that the Company which took over\r\nMr. Brown's business did not long prosper. Whilst he remained at the\r\nhead of it, all went well, but as soon as he left to take a much-needed\r\nrest, it began to fail. The personality of the individual is everything\r\nin most Spanish countries and especially in the Philippines. No\r\nmanager could be found who could keep on terms with the officials,\r\ncontrol the wild wood-cutters or risk jungle-fever by entering the\r\nforests to personally inspect the work.\r\n\r\nThe organization decayed and the business went to pieces. Let intending\r\ninvestors take note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF TAGAL REVOLT.\r\n\r\n    Corrupt officials--\"Laws of the Indies\"--Philippines a dependency\r\n    of Mexico up to 1800--The opening of the Suez Canal--Hordes\r\n    of useless officials--The Asimilistas--Discontent, but no\r\n    disturbance--Absence of crime--Natives petition for the expulsion\r\n    of the Friars--Many signatories of the petition punished.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Colonial system was based upon the simple and\r\nwell-recognised principle of rewarding political services to the\r\nGovernment in power, by the pillage of a colony.\r\n\r\nSometimes special circumstances rendered it necessary for the\r\nGovernment to send out the man best fitted to cope with a critical\r\nsituation, but in normal times the good old corrupt plan was followed.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a Governor-General would be arranged by the Prime\r\nMinister and submitted for the approval of the monarch. The Colonial\r\nMinister, like the other subordinate ministers, counted for little in\r\na Cabinet presided over by such commanding personalities as Canovas,\r\nor Sagasta. They were, in fact, mere heads of departments.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter I have remarked that it was generally believed\r\nthat General Weyler purchased his appointment as Governor-General of\r\nthe Philippines, by a cash payment and an annual subsidy.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, certain officials whom it would be unjust to\r\nclass with those who practically had to rob for their living, because\r\nthey were subject to dismissal at any moment. These unfortunates knew\r\nperfectly well that integrity and ability would not ensure them a\r\nsingle day's grace. Whenever the man in power wanted that place for\r\nhis cousin or his uncle, out they would go. Similarly, if they had any\r\ninterest, misbehaviour would not lose the appointment. Considering\r\nthe system, the wonder was that some of them were honest, not that\r\nmost of them were thieves.\r\n\r\nAmongst those who had fixed appointments were the Inspector-General\r\nof Forests and his assistants. Every British and American resident\r\nin, or visitor to Manila, will remember a Catalan gentleman, Don\r\nSebastian Vidal y Soler and his charming wife Dona Ella Paoli de\r\nVidal, a lady from Philadelphia. Vidal was a man of great learning\r\nand equal modesty, a man of the strictest honour, kind-hearted and\r\ncharitable in the extreme. He was well-known in America, in London,\r\nParis, and Amsterdam, and wherever botanists congregate. His death\r\nin 1890 was universally regretted.\r\n\r\nIn the same branch of the service there was another gentleman whom\r\nI must name. Don Jose Sainz de Baranda, at one time acting Colonial\r\nSecretary, is a most courteous gentleman, whose high character and\r\nmarked ability were well worthy of the confidence reposed in him by\r\nGeneral Terrero. Any country might be proud to own Senor Sainz de\r\nBaranda. For my part I preserve the most agreeable remembrances of\r\nthese two friends.\r\n\r\nIn the Department of Public Works there were men of considerable\r\nattainments as engineers--Don Eduardo Lopez Navarro, author of the\r\nproject for the new harbour; Don Genaro Palacios, who designed and\r\ncarried out the waterworks and designed the Church of Saint Sebastian,\r\nin both of which works I took part; and Senor Brockman, who constructed\r\nseveral lighthouses in different parts of the Archipelago. I feel bound\r\nto say that so far as my knowledge went, there was no corruption or\r\nunderhand work in either the Inspection of Forests or the Public Works.\r\n\r\nAs to the patronage of other civil offices I have had the procedure\r\nexplained to me by a Spaniard well up in the subject, and I give an\r\nimaginary instance to illustrate the system.\r\n\r\nWhen a political party came into power and the question of forming\r\nthe Cabinet was being debated, Senor M----, a leader of a group of\r\ndeputies, might say, \"I renounce the honour of entering the Cabinet,\r\nand instead will take the Presidency of the Chamber and the right to\r\nappoint the Collector of Customs at Havana, the Intendant General of\r\nHacienda at Manila, and the Governor of Batangas, with a dozen second\r\nand third class governorships or judgeships.\"\r\n\r\nIf this was agreed to, perhaps, after some haggling, Senor M----\r\ndistributed the nominations to the lower appointments amongst his\r\nsupporters, who disposed of them for their own advantage.\r\n\r\nThe nominations to the higher offices remained the absolute private\r\nproperty of Senor M----, and he proceeded to pick out men up to the\r\njob, to undertake the appointments. Some of them paid him large sums\r\nin cash, and others entered into contracts binding themselves to remit\r\nhim monthly a large proportion of their emoluments and pickings. In\r\nsome cases it was stipulated that if a single payment was in default,\r\nthe unfortunate employe would be instantly dismissed. I have personally\r\nknown of this condition. Those he nominated referred to him as their\r\npadrino or godfather.\r\n\r\nThe actual holders of the offices referred to would then be summarily\r\ndismissed, however well they might have behaved whilst serving, and\r\nthe new horde would be installed in their places and would use every\r\nmeans to fill their pockets and to pay their padrino.\r\n\r\nComplaints against them were not likely to lead to their removal, for\r\nthey were protected in Madrid by the powerful political interest of\r\ntheir padrino. If they kept within the criminal law, they had little\r\nto fear, however greedy they might be.\r\n\r\nSome of the governors and other officials had the talent of filling\r\ntheir pockets without making enemies. I have already referred to\r\na Governor of Batangas, as eminent in this line. It must not be\r\nsupposed that the illicit gains of the officials were extorted from\r\nthe individual native. They were principally drawn from the fallos,\r\nor local tax in redemption of polos or personal service. This money\r\nought to have been employed in repairing roads, bridges, and public\r\nbuildings. But as nearly the whole was diverted into the pockets\r\nof the officials and their padrinos, the roads became impassable in\r\nthe wet season, the bridges, if of wood, rotted, if of stone, were\r\nthrown down by the earthquakes or carried away by floods, whilst the\r\ntribunales (town halls), fell into decay. I have known cases where\r\na planter has been unable for months to send his sugar down to the\r\nport for shipment, as it was absolutely impossible for carts to pass\r\nalong the road in the wet season. In a wealthy and populous province\r\nlike Batangas, the fallos were sufficient to have paved all the main\r\nroads in the province with granite and to have bridged every stream.\r\n\r\nI may mention here a characteristic trait of Spanish\r\nadministration. When a river-bridge fell down, they not only did\r\nnot repair or renew it, but they put up to auction the monopoly of\r\nferrying vehicles and passengers across the stream. The purchaser of\r\nthe right fastened a rattan across the river and provided a couple\r\nof canoes with a platform of cane laid over them, which served to\r\nferry vehicles across by means of the rope; one or two at a time at a\r\nrather heavy charge. This truly Spanish method provided a revenue for\r\nthe Administration, or pickings for an official, instead of requiring\r\nan outlay for a new bridge.\r\n\r\nStill, the natives, never having known anything better, supported\r\nthese drawbacks with remarkable equanimity. They were left very much\r\nto themselves, and were not interfered with nor worried. The army\r\nwas small and the conscription did not press heavily upon them.\r\n\r\nThey lived under the \"Leyes de Indias\" (may their makers have found\r\nfavour with God), a code of laws deserving of the greatest praise\r\nfor wisdom and humanity. They protected the native against extortion,\r\nconstituting him a perpetual minor as against the usurer. He could not\r\nbe sued for more than five dollars. Compare this wise disposition with\r\nwhat has been going on in India ever since the British Government has\r\nadministered it, where the principal occupation of the lower courts\r\nis to decree the foreclosure of mortgages on the ryot's patches of\r\nland at the suit of the village usurer. The result has been that\r\nin some provinces the small landowner class who furnished fighting\r\nmen for the Indian Army has almost disappeared. It is only now in\r\n1900 that something is proposed to be done to remedy this evil, and\r\nknowing my countrymen, I quite expect some weak-kneed compromise will\r\nbe arrived at.\r\n\r\nThe \"Leyes de Indias\" conferred upon the native the perpetual usufruct\r\nof any land that he kept under cultivation; and this right descended\r\nfrom father to son.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these laws, most of the arable land in Luzon, Cebu,\r\nand some other islands belongs to the natives to this day, although\r\nmany of them have no other title than possession. The natives also had\r\nthe privilege of cutting timber in the forests for house-building or\r\nrepairing, or for making a canoe free of dues. They could also cut\r\nbamboos for their fences or roofs and collect firewood.\r\n\r\nThese privileges were restricted to natives, and were not extended\r\nto Spaniards or Chinese. The taxes paid by the natives were light\r\nand they could live and thrive.\r\n\r\nHad these wise and admirable laws been carried out in the spirit in\r\nwhich they were made, the Philippines might have been Spanish to this\r\nday and the natives would have had little to complain of.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines were for nearly three centuries after their discovery\r\nby the Spaniards a mere dependency of Mexico, communication being kept\r\nup by an annual galleon or sometimes two sailing between Acapulco and\r\nManila through the Strait of San Bernardino. The long and tedious\r\nvoyage deterred all but priests and officials from proceeding to\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\nWhen this route was given up, which happened some ten years before the\r\nIndependence of Mexico, which was proclaimed in 1820, communication\r\nwith the Peninsula was by sailing vessels via the Cape of Good\r\nHope. That was a voyage that would not be lightly undertaken either\r\ngoing or returning. Spaniards who then came to the Archipelago often\r\nstayed there for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the establishment of a\r\nline of steamers bringing Manila within thirty days of Barcelona was\r\nthe most important event in the history of the Philippines since the\r\nconquest, and it had the gravest consequences. It greatly stimulated\r\nthe trade of the Philippines, but it enormously increased the number of\r\nSpaniards in the Islands. Hordes of hungry-looking Iberians arrived\r\nby every steamer with nominations to posts for which most of them\r\npossessed no qualification. It seemed as if all the loafers of the\r\nPuerta del Sol and the Calle de Alcala were to be dumped in the\r\nPhilippines and fed by the Treasury.\r\n\r\nPlaces had to be found for them, and a bureaucratic administration\r\npartly copied from French practice, was rapidly substituted for\r\nthe old paternal regime. New departments were organised or the old\r\nones greatly extended. Far more money was spent on the salaries\r\nof engineers and assistant-engineers than on public works. The\r\nsalaries of the officials of the Woods and Forests exceeded the\r\nrevenue derived from dues on timber cut in the Crown forests,\r\nand their regulations seriously interfered with the privileges of\r\nthe natives previously mentioned, and caused great discontent. The\r\nsalaries of the Inspectors of Mines were almost a useless expense,\r\nfor there was no revenue derived from mines, in fact there were no\r\nmines, only placers and washings. A medical service was organised at\r\ngreat cost and to little advantage. Doctors were appointed to reside\r\nat the hot springs, and one could not take a bath there without paying\r\na fee. Model farms and Schools of Agriculture were started, to find\r\nplaces for more Spaniards, for the officials received their salaries,\r\nbut no funds were forthcoming for material or establishment.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 there took place the separation of the executive and the\r\njudicial functions, and eighteen civil governors were appointed to\r\nthe principal provinces. Later on, eighteen judges of first instance\r\nwere nominated to these same provinces. After centuries of rule,\r\nthe Alcaldes Mayores were abolished.\r\n\r\nThen came a period when certain bureaucrats in Madrid conceived what\r\nthey thought a vast and patriotic idea. They founded a school of\r\npoliticians who called themselves Asimilistas. Their grand idea was\r\nto assimilate the administration of the Philippines to that of the\r\nMother Country. They thought it wise to assimilate the institutions\r\nof a tropical dependency with eight millions of native inhabitants,\r\nof whom one-sixth part were independent heathen or Mahometans, to\r\nthe gradually evolved institutions of Old Spain.\r\n\r\nBy way of a commencement they began to speak and write of the\r\nPhilippines as \"that beautiful province of Spain.\" The Philippine army\r\nhad always been distinct from the Peninsular army, but now by a paper\r\nreform it was embodied in it, and the regiments were re-numbered,\r\nthe 1st Visayas Regiment becoming the 74th, etc. This was considered\r\nto be a strong link to bind together the Mother Country and the Colony.\r\n\r\nThe extra expense of these crowds of employes and of some expeditions\r\nto Mindanao and Jolo was very heavy, accordingly every year saw\r\nsome new and oppressive tax. In 1883 the \"Tributo,\" or tribute that\r\nhad been paid by the natives since the conquest, was replaced by a\r\ntax on the Cedula Personal, or document of identity, and this was\r\npaid by all adults of both sexes, whether Spaniards, foreigners,\r\nor half-castes. In the Appendix will be found a facsimile of my cedula.\r\n\r\nThe Customs duties were several times raised, sometimes without much\r\nnotice. A tax on all trades and professions, on horses and carriages,\r\na heavy port tax, a vexatious tax on all animals slaughtered, even down\r\nto a sucking pig, taxes on the hand-looms used by the women in their\r\nspare time, taxes on sugar-mills, rice-mills, on boats and lighters,\r\nand on houses; all these and many more were collected.\r\n\r\nThere were also serious agrarian disputes between the Dominicans,\r\nthe Augustinians, and the tenants on their estates, owing to\r\nexcessive rents demanded by the friars. All these circumstances\r\nbrought about a great change in the relations between the Spaniards\r\nand the natives. Whereas formerly the wealthy native kept open house\r\non feast days, and received with pleasure the visits of Spaniards,\r\ngenerally elderly men used to the country and speaking the language\r\nof the people, he now found his house invaded by a crowd of young\r\nofficials new to the country and its ways, who fell on the eatables\r\nlike a swarm of famishing locusts, and soon devoured the turkeys\r\nand hams and other good things he had provided to entertain his\r\nfriends. Besides, his women-folk would probably not be treated by the\r\nnew-comers with the courtesy and consideration they had been used to.\r\n\r\nAn estrangement gradually made itself felt, and increased year by\r\nyear, in direct proportion to the influx of Spaniards. Not one in a\r\nhundred of these did any useful work or added in any way to the wealth\r\nof the community. They were the drones of the hive, and were in fact\r\ndirectly harmful, for they had to be supported from the Treasury, and\r\nthey irritated the natives by their illegal exactions and overbearing\r\nconduct whenever they came in contact with them.\r\n\r\nStill year after year passed without disturbances. From 1877 to 1892,\r\nwhilst I was in the country, I can testify that almost perfect order\r\nreigned. The fighting in Mindanao and Jolo went on as a matter of\r\ncourse like the Acheen war in Sumatra, and an expedition was sent\r\nagainst the Igorrotes. But in the civilised districts of Luzon and\r\nVisayas good order was kept. The only outbreak I remember was the\r\nreligious excitement in Samar, which closed when the false gods were\r\nshot down.\r\n\r\nCrime was infrequent, and in those fourteen years I do not think\r\nhalf-a-dozen executions took place. There was less risk of burglary in\r\nManila than in a London suburb. Whatever their faults I must give the\r\nSpanish Administration credit for the perfect order they kept. Manila,\r\nin this respect, compared favourably with Hong Kong, and still better\r\nwith Singapore, where the authorities, perhaps remembering the fate of\r\nGovernor Eyre of Jamaica, and in terror of Exeter Hall, tolerated the\r\nincredible insolence of the Chinese secret societies. These villainous\r\norganisations, which in Singapore successfully defied the law, never\r\nraised their heads in Manila, and Rajah Brooke showed how to treat\r\nthem in Sarawak.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the Asimilista policy, in July 1887, the Penal Code\r\nwas put in force in the Philippines by peremptory order from the\r\nGovernment at Madrid, and much against the opinion of experienced\r\nofficials. In December of the same year the Civil Code was promulgated.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that these reforms, however well-intended,\r\nproduced any beneficial effect on the natives. Combined with the great\r\nincrease in taxation, they intensified the discontent that was always\r\nsmouldering, more especially in the hearts of the native priests. Their\r\ngrievances against the religious orders, and more particularly against\r\nthe Recollets, who had been compensated for the handing over of their\r\nbenefices in Mindanao to the Jesuits, at the expense of the secular\r\nclergy, were the cause of their bitter hatred of the Spanish friars.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Field-Marshal Jovellar had thought it necessary to strengthen\r\nthe small garrison by bringing out two battalions of Marine\r\nInfantry. However it was not till March 1st, 1888, that some natives\r\nand mestizos, emboldened by the fact that an anti-clerical, D. Jose\r\nCenteno, a mining engineer, was Acting Civil Governor of Manila,\r\nwalked in procession to his official residence and presented a petition\r\naddressed to the Governor-General, demanding the immediate expulsion of\r\nthe friars of the religious orders, and of the Archbishop, whom they\r\ndeclared unworthy to occupy the Primacy of the Islands. They further\r\ndemanded the secularisation of the benefices and the confiscation of\r\nthe estates of the Augustinians and the Dominicans.\r\n\r\nTo this petition there were 810 signatures, but when the signatories\r\nwere summoned and examined, most of them (as is their custom) declared\r\nthey did not know what they had signed, and denied that they wished\r\nthe friars to be expelled.\r\n\r\nThe petition was said to have been written by Doroteo Cortes, a\r\nmestizo lawyer, but I am told he did not sign it.\r\n\r\nThis manifestation, sixteen years after the mutiny at Cavite, seems\r\nto have had some relation to that event, for the petition accused\r\nthe friars of compassing the death of Father Burgos, by subornation\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nThe result of this appeal of the natives was that the principal persons\r\nwho took part in it were banished, or sent to reside at undesirable\r\nspots within the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThere were some agrarian disturbances at Calamba and Santa Rosa,\r\none of the estates of the Dominicans, in 1890.\r\n\r\nI may say that only the Augustinians, the Dominicans, and the\r\nRecollets possess landed estates, and that I have had the opportunity\r\nof examining several of them. They are all situated in Tagal territory,\r\nand as they are the pick of the lands, their possession by the friars\r\nhas caused great heart-burnings amongst the Tagals--there has been\r\na smouldering agrarian discontent for years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS ORDERS.\r\n\r\n    The Augustinians--Their glorious founder--Austin Friars in\r\n    England--Scotland--Mexico--They sail with Villalobos for the\r\n    Islands of the Setting Sun--Their disastrous voyage--Fray Andres\r\n    Urdaneta and his companions--Foundation of Cebu and Manila\r\n    with two hundred and forty other towns--Missions to Japan and\r\n    China--The Flora Filipina--The Franciscans--The Jesuits--The\r\n    Dominicans--The Recollets--Statistics of the religious orders in\r\n    the islands--Turbulence of the friars--Always ready to fight for\r\n    their country--Furnish a war ship and command it--Refuse to exhibit\r\n    the titles of their estates in 1689--The Augustinians take up arms\r\n    against the British--Ten of them fall on the field of battle--Their\r\n    rectories sacked and burnt--Bravery of the archbishop and friars in\r\n    1820--Father Ibanez raises a battalion--Leads it to the assault of\r\n    a Moro Cotta--Execution of native priests in 1872--Small garrison\r\n    in the islands--Influence of the friars--Their behaviour--Herr\r\n    Jagor--Foreman--Worcester--Younghusband--Opinion of Pope Clement\r\n    X.--Tennie C.

They won the islands for Spain,\r\nthey held them for centuries, and now, having served their purpose,\r\nthey have lost them, doubtless for ever.\r\n\r\nThe Augustinians were the pioneers in converting the inhabitants of the\r\nPhilippines, and they have maintained their predominance ever since.\r\n\r\nI therefore begin my description with this venerable order, and it\r\nwill be proper to say something about its glorious founder.\r\n\r\nThe following data are taken from the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica'\r\nand other sources.\r\n\r\nAugustine (Aurelius Augustinus) one of the four great fathers of\r\nthe Latin Church, and admittedly the greatest of the four, was born\r\nat Tagaste (Tajelt), a town of Numidia, North Africa, A.D. 354. His\r\nfather, Patricius, was a burgess of this town, and was still a pagan\r\nat the time of his son's birth.\r\n\r\nHis mother, Monica, was not only a Christian, but a woman of the most\r\nelevated, tender, and devoted piety, whose affectionate and beautiful\r\nenthusiasm have passed into a touching type of womanly saintliness\r\nfor all ages.\r\n\r\nAugustine studied rhetoric at Madaura and Carthage, and visited Rome\r\nand Milan.\r\n\r\nHe passed many years in unrest of mind and doubt, but ultimately a\r\npassage from Romans xii. 13, 14 seemed to pour the light of peace into\r\nhis heart. He became a Christian and was baptised in his thirty-third\r\nyear. Patricius was also converted and baptised, and Monica found the\r\ndesire of her life fulfilled and her dear ones united to her in faith.\r\n\r\nAfter some years of retirement, Augustine made a journey to Hippo\r\nRegius, a Roman colony on the River Rubricatus in North Africa,\r\nand became a presbyter.\r\n\r\nHis principal writings are 'The City of God,' 'Confessions,' and\r\n'The Trinity.'\r\n\r\nHe died during the siege of Hippo by the Vandals at the age of 75.\r\n\r\nThe theological position and influence of Augustine may be said to\r\nbe unrivalled. No single name has ever exercised such power over the\r\nChristian Church, and no one mind has ever made such an impression\r\nupon Christian thought.\r\n\r\nThe Augustinians look upon this great Christian moralist as their\r\nfounder, and reverence his memory and that of his saintly mother.\r\n\r\nWhether he personally drew up the rules they observe or not, they\r\nwere his disciples, following in his foot-steps, and finding their\r\ninspiration in his writings and example.\r\n\r\nGreat indeed must have been the magnetic force of that vehement nature\r\nthat it could give an impetus to his followers that carried them all\r\nover Europe, that made them the companions of the discoverers and\r\nconquerors of the New World, and that filled their hearts with zeal\r\nand courage to face the dangers of the great lone ocean in company\r\nwith Villalobos and Legaspi.\r\n\r\nThe Order traces its inception to the town of Hippo, and fixes\r\nthe date at A.D. 395. Many, doubtless, were its vicissitudes, but\r\nin the year 1061, and again in 1214, we find the Order remodelled\r\nand extended. The Augustinians were very numerous in England and\r\nScotland. In 1105 they had settled at Colchester and at Nostell, near\r\nPontefract. Later they had abbeys at Bristol, Llantony, Christchurch,\r\nTwynham, Bolton and London, where part of their church (Austin Friars)\r\nis still standing. Altogether they had 170 houses in England. Their\r\nfirst house in Scotland was at Scone in 1114, and they soon had 25\r\nhouses, including churches or abbeys at Inchcolm in the Firth of Forth,\r\nSt Andrew's, Holyrood, Cambuskenneth and Inchaffray.\r\n\r\nThe Austin Friars or Black Canons were then described as an order of\r\nregular clergy holding a middle position between monks and secular\r\ncanons, almost resembling a community of parish priests living under\r\nrule, and they have retained these characteristics to the present day.\r\n\r\nThey were numerous in Spain, and some of the other Orders, such as the\r\nDominicans or Preaching Friars, the Franciscans, and the Recollets,\r\nmay almost be looked upon as offshoots of this venerable order, for\r\nthey conformed to its general rule, with certain additions. Thus the\r\nDominicans, founded by Saint Dominic de Guzman, were incorporated in\r\n1216 by a Bull of Pope Honorius III. and adopted a rule of absolute\r\npoverty or mendicancy in addition to the usual vows of chastity\r\nand obedience.\r\n\r\nThis Order held its first chapter in 1220 at Bologna, under the\r\npresidency of its founder.\r\n\r\nThe vows of poverty of this powerful Order have not prevented it\r\nfrom holding large estates in the Philippines, from owning blocks\r\nof buildings in Manila and Hong Kong, and from having a huge sum\r\ninvested in British and American securities. These however belong to\r\nthe Corporation and not to the individual members.\r\n\r\nFrom Spain the Augustinians spread to Mexico and assisted the\r\nFranciscans, who were the pioneers there under Father Bartolome\r\nde Olmedo and Father Martin de Valencia, to gather in the abundant\r\nharvest. Father Toribio de Benavente was one of twelve Franciscans\r\nsent out in 1523, and he has left records of the success of these\r\nmissionaries. They opened schools and founded colleges, and in\r\ntwenty years nine millions of converts had been admitted into the\r\nChristian fold.\r\n\r\nBy this time Magellan had passed the narrow straits, and sailing\r\nacross the vast solitudes of the Pacific had reached the Visayas\r\nIslands to meet his fate, and Sebastian de Elcano had completed the\r\ncircumnavigation of the globe and had arrived in Spain with accounts\r\nof the new lands which the expedition had discovered.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1542, Captain Ruy Lopez de Villalobos sailed from Natividad\r\n(Mexico) for the Islands of the Setting Sun, only to die of grief at\r\nAmboyna, there accompanied him a group of Augustinian Friars. After\r\nthe loss of his vessels the survivors took ship for Goa and from\r\nthence returned to Europe, arriving at Lisbon in August 1549, seven\r\nyears after leaving the port of Natividad.\r\n\r\nThe Order has carefully preserved the names of these early\r\nmissionaries; they are, Frs. Jeronimo de San Esteban, Sebastian de\r\nTrasierra, Nicolas de Perea, Alonso Alvarado.\r\n\r\nIn the expedition under General Don Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, which\r\nsailed in 1564, Fray Andres Urdaneta, an Augustinian, went as chief\r\nnavigator and cartographer, and the following friars accompanied him:\r\nFrs. Andres de Aiguirre, Martin de Rada, Diego Herrero, Pedro Gamboa.\r\n\r\nSince founding the city of Cebu in 1570, and the city of Manila\r\nthe following year, the Augustinians have continued to found town\r\nafter town, and down to 1892 had founded no less than two hundred\r\nand forty-two, administered by two hundred and forty-seven priests\r\nof the Order as by the following table:--\r\n\r\n\r\nYear 1892.\r\n\r\n        Summary of Towns founded by the Augustinians.\r\n\r\n        Handed over to other Orders              28\r\n        Amalgamated with other towns             11\r\n        Administered by Augustinians            203\r\n                                                ---\r\n                        Total                   242\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation of the above 203 towns, 2,082,181.\r\n\r\nThe Augustinians in the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n    In Parish Ministry.\r\n                       Parish Priests               188\r\n                       Stewards                      37\r\n                       Coadjutors                     7\r\n                       Vicars (learning dialects)     3\r\n                       Missionaries                  12\r\n                                                    ---\r\n                                                    247\r\n\r\n    Residing in the convents of Manila, Cebu, and Guadalupe.\r\n                       Superiors or Office bearers   19\r\n                       Conventual Priests             7\r\n                       Students                      14\r\n                       Invalids                       6\r\n                       Lay Brethren                  17\r\n                                                     --\r\n                                                     63\r\n                                                    ===\r\n                            Total                   310\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former years this Order had established missions in Japan, and they\r\nwere very successful in making converts, but during the persecution\r\nmany members of the Order lost their lives, or, as they phrase it,\r\n\"attained the palm of martyrdom.\"\r\n\r\nAt the present time they maintain seven missionaries in the province\r\nof Hun-nan in China. In Spain they support three colleges, Valladolid,\r\nLa Vid, and La Escorial. They are also in charge of the magnificent\r\nchurch of that extraordinary palace, and of the priceless library of\r\nwhich they are editing a catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe Augustinians have published a great many works, such as grammars\r\nand vocabularies of the native dialects, and many books of devotion.\r\n\r\nOne of their leading men, Father Manuel Blanco, was a most learned\r\nand laborious botanist. He collected and classified so many of the\r\nPhilippine plants that the Order decided to complete his work and\r\npublish it. Fray Andres Naves and Fray Celestino Fernandez Villar,\r\nboth well-known to me, worked for years at this, and were assisted\r\nby my illustrious friend H. E. Don Sebastian Vidal Soler and others.\r\n\r\nThe result is a most sumptuous and magnificent work--published in\r\nManila--there being four folio volumes enriched by many hundreds\r\nof coloured plates of the different trees, shrubs, orchids and\r\nlianas, most beautifully executed from water-colour paintings by\r\nD. Regino Garcia and others. This monumental book is called the\r\n'Flora Filipina.' It received a diploma of honour at the International\r\nColonial Exhibition of Amsterdam in 1883. The British Museum possesses\r\na copy, but unfortunately most of the work was destroyed by fire in\r\nthe bombardment of the Convent of Guadalupe during the war.\r\n\r\nHowever, the widow of Senor Vidal, now Mrs. Amilon of Philadelphia,\r\nstill has some copies to dispose of.\r\n\r\nI hope that what I have said about the Augustinians will show that\r\nthey are not the lazy and unprofitable persons they are sometimes\r\nrepresented. The same may be said of the Dominicans.\r\n\r\nThe Augustinians were followed, after an interval of seven years,\r\nby the Franciscans, four years after that by the Jesuits, six years\r\nafter the Jesuits came the Dominicans.\r\n\r\nLast of all came the Recollets, or bare-footed Augustinians.\r\n\r\nThe following Table gives the numbers of friars of the five religious\r\norders in the Philippines, at the dates mentioned, taken from their own\r\nreturns. The first column gives the dates of the first foundation of\r\nthe Order, the second the date of its arrival in the Archipelago.

Thus in 1582 we find them refusing to admit the diocesan\r\nvisit of the Bishop of Manila, and that old dispute has cropped\r\nup on and off many times since then. At the same time we find them\r\ntaking the part of the natives against the Encomenderos. They have\r\nalways been ready to fight for their country and to subscribe money\r\nfor its defence. When Acting Governor Guido de Lavezares headed the\r\ncolumn which attacked the pirate Li-ma-Hon, he was accompanied by\r\nthe Provincial of the Augustinians. In 1603 all the friars in Manila\r\ntook up arms against the revolted Chinese, and three years later the\r\nAugustinians not only furnished a war ship to fight the Portuguese,\r\nbut provided a captain for it in the person of one of their Order,\r\nFray Antonio Flores. It appears that the estates of the Augustinians\r\nand the Dominicans were very early a bone of contention, for in 1689\r\na judge arrived in Manila, and, in virtue of a special commission he\r\nhad brought from Madrid, he required them to present their titles. This\r\nthey refused to do, and the judge was sent back to Mexico, and a friend\r\nof the friars was appointed as Commissioner in his place. Then the\r\nfriars condescended to unofficially exhibit their titles. Now more\r\nthan two centuries after the first abortive attempt, the question of\r\nthe ownership of these lands is still under discussion.\r\n\r\nDuring the British occupation of Manila in 1763 the friars took up\r\narms in defence of their flag, and gave their church bells to be\r\ncast into cannon. No less than ten Augustinians fell on the field\r\nof battle. The British treated them with great severity, sacking and\r\ndestroying their rectories and estate houses, and selling everything\r\nof theirs they could lay hands on. I have visited the ruins of the\r\nold estate house of Malinta which was burnt by the British.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, when the massacre of foreigners by the Manila mob took\r\nplace, owing the cowardice of General Folgueras, the archbishop and\r\nfriars marched out in procession to the scene of the disturbance and\r\nsucceeded in saving many lives. In 1851 a Recollet, Father Ibanez,\r\nraised a battalion from his congregation, trained and commanded it. He\r\ntook the field at Mindanao and with the most undaunted bravery led his\r\nmen to the assault of a Moro Cotta, or fort, dying like our General\r\nWolfe at the moment of victory. Not one man of this battalion ever\r\ndeserted or hung back from the combats, for the worthy priest had\r\nall their wives under a solemn vow never to receive them again unless\r\nthey returned victorious from the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe religious orders have frequently interfered to protect the\r\nnatives against the civil authorities, and were often on very good\r\nterms with the mass of their parishioners. The greatest jealousy of\r\nthem was felt by the native clergy.\r\n\r\nThe military revolt which broke out in Cavite in 1872, was doubtless\r\ninspired by this class, who saw that a policy had been adopted of\r\nfilling vacancies in all benefices except the poorest, with Spanish\r\nfriars instead of natives. The condemnation of Burgos, Gomez,\r\nand Zamora, three native priests who were executed at Manila soon\r\nafter the suppression of the revolt, is ascribed by the natives and\r\nmestizos to the subornation of justice to the friars, who are said\r\nto have paid a large sum for their condemnation.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, there is no doubt that since that date the\r\nfeeling against the friars has become intensified.\r\n\r\nThe friars were the chief outposts and even bulwarks of the government\r\nagainst rebellions. Almost every rising has been detected by them,\r\nmany plots being revealed by women under the seal of confession. It\r\nwas only by the assistance of the friars that the islands were held\r\nby Spain for so many centuries almost without any military force.\r\n\r\nThe islands were not conquered by force of arms--the people were\r\nconverted almost without firing a shot.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the fighting was to protect the natives against\r\nChinese pirates, Japanese corsairs, Dutch rovers, or the predatory\r\nheathen.\r\n\r\nThe defensive forces consisted of local troops and companies of\r\nMexican and Peruvian Infantry. It is only since 1828 that Manila has\r\nbeen garrisoned by regular troops from the Peninsula.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence in the islands I do not think there were more than\r\n1500 Spanish troops in garrison in the whole islands, except when\r\nsome marines were sent out. These troops belonged to the Peninsular\r\nRegiment of Artillery, and were a very fine looking set of men.\r\n\r\nThat this small force could be sufficient is evidently due to the\r\ninfluence of the friars in keeping the people quiet.\r\n\r\nYet the feeling of a great majority of Spanish civilians was against\r\nthe friars, and I think many of those who supported them, only did\r\nso from interested motives.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that as the number of Spaniards increased, the\r\ninfluence of the friars diminished, for the Spanish anti-clericals\r\nhad no scruples in criticising the priests and in speaking plainly\r\nto the natives to their prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe friars have fared badly at the hands of several writers on the\r\nPhilippines; but it will be noticed that those who know the least\r\nabout them speak the worst of them.\r\n\r\nHerr Jagor, who was much amongst them, bears witness to the strict\r\ndecorum of their households, whilst he very justly says that the\r\nbehaviour of the native clergy leaves something to be desired.\r\n\r\nForeman hints at horrors, and with questionable taste relates how he\r\nfound amongst a priest's baggage some very obscene pictures.\r\n\r\nWorcester thinks the priests' influence wholly bad. From what he\r\nstates in his book, he must have come across some very bad specimens\r\namongst the smaller islands where he wandered.\r\n\r\nYounghusband, who perhaps got his information at the bar of the Manila\r\nClub, describes them as \"monsters of lechery.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that when the conclusions of a tribunal\r\nfavourable to the canonisation of Santa Rosa de Lima, Patroness of\r\nthe Indies, were laid before Pope Clement X., that Pontiff manifested\r\nhis incredulity that a tropical climate could produce a saint. He\r\nis even credited with the saying that bananas and saints are not\r\ngrown together.\r\n\r\nThe tradition may be erroneous, but there is something in the opinion\r\nthat deserves to be remembered.\r\n\r\nTemperature does have something to do with sexual morality, and in\r\ncomparing one country with another an allowance must be made for the\r\nheight of the thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe friars in the Philippines are but men, and men exposed to great\r\ntemptations. We should remember the tedium of life in a provincial\r\ntown, where, perhaps, the parish priest is the only European, and\r\nis surfeited with the conversation of his native curates, of the\r\nhalf-caste apothecary and the Chinese store-keeper. He has neither\r\nsociety nor amusement.\r\n\r\nI have previously remarked upon the position of women in the\r\nPhilippines. I may repeat that their position, both by law and custom,\r\nis at least as good as in the most advanced countries.\r\n\r\nI remember reading with great interest, and, perhaps, some sympathy,\r\na remarkable article in the New York Herald, of January 10th, 1894,\r\nheaded \"Virtue Defined,\" signed by Tennie C. Claflin (Lady Cook),\r\nand it seemed to me a plea for \"equality of opportunity\" between the\r\nsexes, if I may borrow the phrase from diplomacy. Well, that equality\r\nexists in the Philippines. Whilst unmarried, the girls enjoy great\r\nfreedom. In that tolerant land a little ante-nuptial incontinence\r\nis not an unpardonable crime in a girl any more than in a youth,\r\nnor does it bar the way to marriage.\r\n\r\nThe girls whilst young possess exceedingly statuesque figures, and what\r\ncharms they have are nature's own, for they owe nothing to art. Their\r\ndress is modest, yet as they do not wear a superfluity of garments,\r\nat times, as when bathing, their figures are revealed to view.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the above condition of things and that the priest\r\nis the principal man in the town and able to do many favours to his\r\nfriends, it is not surprising if some of the young women, impelled\r\nby the desire of obtaining his good graces, make a dead set at\r\nhim, such as we sometimes see made at a bachelor curate in our own\r\nso-very-much-more frigid and, therefore, moral country. The priest,\r\nshould he forget his vows of celibacy, is a sinner, and deserving\r\nof blame for failing to keep the high standard of virtue which his\r\nChurch demands. But I do not see in that a justification for calling\r\nhim a monster. Have we never heard of a backslider in Brooklyn, or of\r\na clerical co-respondent at home, that we should expect perfection in\r\nthe Philippines? As for the statements that the priests take married\r\nwomen by force, that is an absurdity. The Tagals are not men to suffer\r\nsuch an outrage.\r\n\r\nThe toleration enjoyed by the girls, above referred to, is a heritage\r\nfrom heathen times, which three centuries of Christianity have failed\r\nto extirpate. In fact, this is a characteristic of the Malay race.\r\n\r\nDuring the many years I was in the islands I had frequent occasion to\r\navail myself of the hospitality of the priests on my journeys. This was\r\nusually amongst the Augustinians, the Dominicans and the Recollets. I\r\ndeclare that on none of those many occasions did I ever witness\r\nanything scandalous, or indecorous in their convents, and I arrived\r\nat all hours and without notice.\r\n\r\nAs to Younghusband's denouncement of them as \"monsters of lechery,\"\r\nI would say that they were notoriously the most healthy and the\r\nlongest-lived people in the islands, and if that most unjust accusation\r\nwas true, this could hardly be the case. It should be remembered\r\nthat the priest of any large town would be a man advanced in years\r\nand therefore less likely to misconduct himself.\r\n\r\nThere was also the certainty that any open scandal would be followed\r\nby punishment from the provincial and council of the order. I have\r\nknown a priest to be practically banished to a wretched hamlet amongst\r\nsavages for two years for causing scandal.\r\n\r\nSome late writers speak of the native clergy as if they were of\r\nsuperior morality and better behaved than the Spanish priests. That\r\nappreciation does not commend itself to those who have had some\r\nexperience of the Philippine clergy.\r\n\r\nSome of those I have known were of very relaxed morals, not to say\r\nscandalous in their behaviour. The Philippine Islands, in short, are\r\nnot the chosen abode of chastity: but I do not know why the Spanish\r\nfriars should be singled out for special censure in this respect.\r\n\r\nI can truly say that I was not acquainted with any class out there\r\nentitled to cast the first stone.\r\n\r\nEach of the orders (except the Jesuits) is a little republic governed\r\nor administered by officers and functionaries elected by the suffrages\r\nof the members. The head of the order is a Superior or General,\r\nwho resides in Rome, but the head in the Philippines is called the\r\nProvincial.\r\n\r\nThe brethren render him the greatest respect and obedience, kneeling\r\ndown to kiss his hand.\r\n\r\nThere is a council to assist the provincial, they are called\r\ndefinidores or padres graves, the exact nomenclature varies in the\r\ndifferent orders.\r\n\r\nThere is a Procurator or Commissary in Madrid, a Procurator-General\r\nin Manila, a Prior or Guardian to each convent not being a rectory,\r\nan Orator or preacher, lay-brethren in charge of estates or of works,\r\nparish priests, missionaries, and coadjutors, learning the native\r\ndialects.\r\n\r\nThe members of the order were appointed to benefices according to\r\ntheir standing and popularity amongst their brethren. The neophytes are\r\ntrained in one of the seminaries of the order in Spain; for instance,\r\nthe Augustinians have colleges at Valladolid, La Vid, and La Escorial,\r\nwith more than 300 students.\r\n\r\nWhen a young priest first arrived in the Philippines, he was sent as\r\na coadjutor to some parish priest to learn the dialect of the people\r\nhe is to work amongst. Then he would be appointed a missionary to the\r\nheathen, where he lived on scanty pay, amongst savages, either in the\r\nhighlands of Luzon or in some remote island, remaining there for two or\r\nthree years. His first promotion would be to a parish consisting of a\r\nvillage of thatched houses (nipa) and, perhaps, the church and convent\r\nwould be of the same material. This meant a constant and imminent\r\ndread of the almost instantaneous destruction of his dwelling by\r\nfire. Perhaps there is communication with Manila once a month, when,\r\nby sending to the nearest port, he may get letters and newspapers and\r\nreceive some provisions, an occasional cask of Spanish red wine, some\r\ntins of chorizos (Estremeno smoked sausages), a sack of garbanzos,\r\nor frijoles, a box of turron de Alicante, and some cigars from the\r\nprocuration of the convent in Manila. These would be charged to his\r\naccount, and frugally as he might live, many a year might pass over\r\nhis head before he would be out of debt to his Order. And poor as he\r\nmight be, he would never refuse his house or his table to any European\r\nwho might call upon him. Later on, if his conduct had satisfied his\r\nsuperiors, the time would come when he would get nominated to a more\r\naccessible and more profitable parish, that would quickly enable him\r\nto pay off the debt due to the procuration. He would have a church\r\nand convent of stone, keep a carriage and pair of ponies, and begin to\r\nhave a surplus, and to contribute a little to the funds of his Order.\r\n\r\nSoon he would become Padre Grave, and begin to have influence with\r\nhis colleagues. He would be removed to a richer town and nominated\r\nVicario Foraneo, equivalent to an archdeacon in England. Later on,\r\nhe might be elected a Definidor, or councillor. Then, perhaps,\r\none of the great prizes of the order fell to his lot. He might be\r\nappointed parish priest of Taal or Binan, worth at least ten thousand\r\ndollars a year, or of rich Lipa, high amongst its coffee groves (now,\r\nalas! withered), which used to be worth twenty thousand dollars in a\r\ngood year. He would treat himself well, and liberally entertain all\r\nwho visited him, and governors of provinces, judges, officers of the\r\nGuardia Civil, would often be seen at his table.\r\n\r\nHe would make large contributions to the funds of the Order, with\r\nthe surplus revenue of his parish.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the priest whose career we have been following, had\r\nshown sufficient character for a champion, and had become popular\r\nin the Order, he might, perhaps, be elected Provincial, and then,\r\ndisposing of the influence of his Order, some day get himself made a\r\nBishop or even Archbishop of Manila, should a vacancy occur, and so\r\nbecome a prince of the Church.\r\n\r\nWhatever talents a friar had, a sphere could always be found for\r\ntheir exercise. If he had a gift for preaching, he could be appointed\r\nOrator of the Order. If he was good at Latin and Greek, he could be\r\nmade a professor at the university. If he was a good business man,\r\nhe could be chosen procurator. If he had diplomatic talents, he could\r\nbe made commissary of the order at Madrid. In any case he was sure\r\nto be taken care of to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nAs for the Orders in themselves, I have already said that,\r\nexcepting the Society of Jesus, they are little republics, and that\r\noffice-holders are elected by the votes of the members. When a general\r\nChapter of the Order is held for this purpose, the members come from\r\nall parts and assemble in their convent in Manila.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that there has sometimes been so much feeling aroused\r\nover the question of the distribution of the loaves and fishes, that\r\nthe opposing parties have broken up the chairs and benches to serve\r\nas clubs, and furiously attacked each other in the battle royal,\r\nand with deplorable results.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, when the chapter or general assembly was to\r\nbe held, the governor-general nominated a royal commissary, often\r\na colonel in the army, to be present at these meetings, but only to\r\ninterfere to keep the peace. It was something of an anomaly to see a\r\nson of Mars deputed to keep the peace in an assembly of the clergy. The\r\nmeeting commenced with prayer, then one by one all the dignitaries\r\nlaid down their offices and became private members of the Order,\r\nso that at the end of this ceremony every one was absolutely equal.\r\n\r\nThen the eldest rose and solemnly adjured any one present who held a\r\nBull of the Holy Father, to produce it then and there under pain of\r\nmajor excommunication. Three times was this solemn warning delivered.\r\n\r\nIt owes its origin, perhaps, to some surprise sprung on a brotherhood\r\nin former days, yet it is to be noted that one of the privileges of\r\ntheir Catholic majesties the kings of Spain was, that no Bull should\r\nrun in their dominions without their approval.\r\n\r\nThen free from outside interference, and all present being on an\r\nequal footing the election takes place. Amidst great excitement\r\nthe Provincial, the Procurator, the Orator, the Definidores, or\r\nCouncillors, are chosen according to their popularity, or as they are\r\ndeemed best fitted to advance the interests of the voter or the Order.\r\n\r\nThe selection of office-holders is a matter of the greatest importance\r\nto the members, as those in power distribute the benefices and are\r\napt to be more alive to the merits of their supporters, than to the\r\npretensions of those who have voted for others.\r\n\r\nBut, however divided they may be on these occasions, they unite against\r\nany outsider, and unless the question is evidently personal, he who\r\noffends a member finds the Order ranged against him, and, perhaps,\r\nthe other Orders also, for in matters affecting their interests\r\nthe Orders act in unison, and as has been said, have succeeded in\r\nremoving not only governors of provinces, but governors-general also\r\nwhen these have failed to do their bidding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHEIR ESTATES.\r\n\r\n    Malinta and Piedad--Mandaloyan--San Francisco de\r\n    Malabon--Irrigation works--Imus--Calamba--Cabuyao--Santa\r\n    Rosa--Binan--San Pedro Tunasan--Naic--Santa Cruz--Estates a\r\n    bone of contention for centuries--Principal cause of revolt\r\n    of Tagals--But the Peace Commission guarantee the Orders in\r\n    possession--Pacification retarded--Summary--The Orders must\r\n    go!--And be replaced by natives.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Augustinians own some fine estates near Manila. In 1877 I visited\r\nMalinta and Piedad, which, according to an old plan exhibited to\r\nme, drawn by some ancient navigator, measured over 14,000 acres in\r\nextent, a good part of which was cultivated and under paddy; still a\r\nlarge expanse was rocky, and grew only cogon (elephant grass). The\r\nlay-brother in charge, Aureliano Garcia, confided to me that he\r\nwent about in fear, and expected to end his life under the bolos\r\nof the tenants. I was then new to the country, and saw no signs of\r\ndiscontent. I afterwards visited Mandaloyan, another estate nearer\r\nManila. This was nearly all arable land. The house was large and\r\ncommodious, and was used as a convalescent home for the friars. I have\r\nnot a note of the extent of this estate, but it occupies a great part\r\nof the space between the rivers Maibonga and San Juan, to the north\r\nof the Pasig. The lay-brother in charge, Julian Ibeas, did not seem at\r\nall anxious about his safety. The land here was more fertile than that\r\nof Malinta, and there was water carriage to a market for the crops.\r\n\r\nIn view of my report, which was not, however, unduly optimistic, my\r\nclients deputed me to ask the Augustinians for a lease of the above\r\nthree estates for twenty-five years, the rent to be $40,000 [7]\r\nper year for three years, and each year after that an addition of\r\na thousand dollars, so that the ultimate rent would be $62,000 per\r\nannum. However, after taking some time to consider, the procurator\r\ndeclined the offer.\r\n\r\nOn the above estates there was little or nothing done by the owners\r\nto improve the land. They had limited themselves to building large\r\nand convenient houses and granaries for their own accommodation,\r\nand to entertain their friends.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 I constructed a pumping station on the River Tuliajan in this\r\nestate, and laid a pipe line right through the property to supply fresh\r\nwater to the sugar refinery at Malabon, five miles distant. I had no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining permission, indeed, Fray Arsenio Campo (now\r\nBishop of Nueva Caceres) facilitated the work in every way. The only\r\nprotest was by Doroteo Cortes, a half-caste lawyer, who interposed\r\nas the pipe had to pass between two fish-ponds belonging to him,\r\nand he extorted a blackmail $800 to withdraw his opposition. Let the\r\nreader contrast the behaviour of the Spaniard and the half-caste,\r\nnow posing as an \"Americanista.\"\r\n\r\nSan Francisco de Malabon, another possession of theirs, is a\r\nmagnificent property, situated on the fertile, well-watered land\r\nthat slopes from the summits of the Tagaytay range, north of the vast\r\ncrater-lake of Bombon, to the shores of the ever-famous Bay of Bacoor,\r\nthe scene of Spain's naval collapse.\r\n\r\nThrough the volcanic soil three rivers, the Ilang-ilang, the\r\nCamanchile, and the Jalan, have cut deep gashes down to the bed-rock,\r\non the surface of which the rapid waters rush downwards to the sea.\r\n\r\nA nobly-proportioned house of stone, almost a fortress, was planted\r\nwhere it commanded a grand, a stately view. From its windows the\r\nspectator looked over fields of waving grain, over fruit trees, and\r\ntown and hamlets, down to the sea shore, and across the vast expanse\r\nof placid bay to where in the far north solitary Arayat rears his\r\nhead. The thick walls and lofty roof excluded the solar heat, and the\r\ngreen-painted Venetians saved the inmate from the glare. Very welcome\r\nwas that hostel, furnished in severe ecclesiastical almost mediaeval\r\nstyle, to me, after the dusty up-hill drive of eight miles from Cavite.\r\n\r\nI visited this estate in 1879, and found that extensive irrigation\r\nworks had been carried out. A new dam on one of the rivers, about\r\nfifty feet high, was approaching completion. Unfortunately, the\r\nwork had been executed by a lay-brother, a stone mason, without\r\nprofessional supervision. He was ignorant of the necessity of taking\r\nspecial precautions when preparing the seat for the dam. Although\r\nhe had a bed of volcanic tuff to build upon he would not go to the\r\ntrouble to cut into and stop all faults and crevices in the rock\r\nbefore laying his first course of masonry, and he hurried on the job\r\nto save expense as he supposed. For the same reason he did not attempt\r\nto follow the correct profile of the dam. When the pressure came on,\r\nthe water spouted up in little fountains, and gradually increased as\r\nit cut away the soft stone. I advised them what to do, and after a\r\ngood deal of work, Portland cement and puddled clay got them out of\r\ntheir difficulty.\r\n\r\nAbout four miles to the eastward of San Francisco de Malabon, and\r\non the same volcanic soil, is the great estate of Imus belonging to\r\nthe Recollets, or unshod Augustinians. It is about five miles from\r\nthe landing-place at Bacoor. Here again three rivers run through the\r\nproperty, and the view from the house is the same.\r\n\r\nThe house itself was a grim fortress and served the rebels well in\r\n1896, for they found arms and ammunition in it, and successfully\r\ndefended it against General Aiguirre who had to retire, being unable\r\nto take it without artillery.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the army of General Lachambre advanced against Imus, and on\r\nthe 24th March took the outer defences of the town, notwithstanding\r\nthe determined resistance of the Tagals, of whom three hundred were\r\nkilled in a hand-to-hand combat. Next day the estate house, which\r\nadjoins the town and had been for six months the stronghold of the\r\nKatipunan, was bombarded and burnt, only the ruins remain.\r\n\r\nThere are extensive works of irrigation at this place also, and\r\nformerly a large sugar works was built here by the owners, but it\r\nfailed, as there was no one fit to take charge of it.\r\n\r\nI have not visited this Hacienda, and cannot give its extent or value.\r\n\r\nOf all the Orders the greatest land-owners are the Dominicans. They\r\nhave vast estates in Calamba, Cabuyao, Santa Rosa, Binan, and San Pedro\r\nTunasan, all on the Lake of Bay, also at Naic and Santa Cruz on the\r\nBay of Manila. I have several times visited their estates at the first\r\ntwo places, and can affirm that they have expended considerable sums\r\nin building dams for irrigating the lands, and I supplied them with\r\nsome very large cast-iron pipes for the purpose of making a syphon\r\nacross a ravine or narrow valley to convey water for irrigating the\r\nopposite plain. They have consequently very largely increased the\r\nvalue of these lands.\r\n\r\nThe house at Calamba, solidly built of stone, with a strong and high\r\nencircling wall, served as a fortified camp and headquarters for the\r\nSpanish army in operation against the rebels in 1897.\r\n\r\nThis estate of Calamba has earned a sad notoriety in the Philippines,\r\nfor the disputes which constantly arose between the administration\r\nand their tenants.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly too much to say that the possession of estates has been\r\nfatal to the Orders. They claim to have always been good and indulgent\r\nlandlords, but the fact remains that all these estates are in Tagal\r\nterritory, that only the Tagals revolted, and that the revolt was\r\ndirected against the Orders because of their tyranny and extortions,\r\nand because they were landlords and rack renters.\r\n\r\nIt was, is now, and ever will be an Agrarian question that will\r\ncontinue to give trouble and be the cause of crime and outrage until\r\nsettled in a broad-minded and statesman-like manner.\r\n\r\nThese estates have been a bone of contention for centuries, and\r\nwere a principal cause of the last revolt of the Tagals. Yet the\r\nPeace Commission at Paris appears to have given the three Orders\r\na new title to their disputed possessions by guaranteeing to the\r\nChurch the enjoyment of its property, which, if the Spaniards had\r\ncontinued to rule the islands, must ultimately have been taken from\r\nit in the natural course of events, as has happened in every other\r\nCatholic country.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the pacification of the Philippines by the\r\nAmerican forces has been greatly retarded, and is now rendered\r\nmore difficult, by this clause, which must have been accepted by the\r\nAmerican commissioners under a misapprehension of its import, and from\r\nimperfect information as to the status quo. This difficult matter can\r\nstill be arranged, but it will require the outlay of a considerable\r\nsum of money, which, however, would eventually be recouped.\r\n\r\nIn present circumstances I venture to say that a garrison would be\r\nneeded at each estate to protect an administrator or collector, for the\r\nTagal tenants are as averse to paying rent for land as any bog-trotter\r\nin Tipperary. I do not envy anybody who purchases these estates, nor\r\nwould I consider the life of such a one a good risk for an insurance\r\ncompany, if he intended to press the tenants for rents or arrears.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the Religious Orders, they were hardy and adventurous\r\npioneers of Christianity, and in the evangelisation of the Philippines,\r\nby persuasion and teaching, they did more for Christianity and\r\ncivilisation than any other missionaries of modern times.\r\n\r\nOf undaunted courage they have ever been to the front when calamities\r\nthreatened their flocks; they have witnessed and recorded some of the\r\nmost dreadful convulsions of nature, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes,\r\nand destructive typhoons. In epidemics of plague and cholera they\r\nhave not been dismayed, nor have they ever in such cases abandoned\r\ntheir flocks.\r\n\r\nWhen an enemy has attacked the islands they have been the first to\r\nface the shot. Only fervent faith could enable these men to endure\r\nthe hardships, and overcome the dangers that encompassed them.\r\n\r\nThey have done much for education, having founded schools for both\r\nsexes, training colleges for teachers, the university of St. Thomas\r\nin Manila, and other institutions.\r\n\r\nHospitals and asylums attest their charity. They were formerly,\r\nand even lately, the protectors of the poor against the rich, and of\r\nthe native against the Spaniard. They have consistently resisted the\r\nenslavement of the natives.\r\n\r\nThey restrained the constant inclination of the natives to wander\r\naway into the woods and return to primitive savagery by keeping them\r\nin the towns, or, as they said, \"Under the bells.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, peace and plenty (those blessings for which we\r\npray), have corrupted and demoralised the Orders. No longer liable at\r\nany moment to be called upon to fight for their lives, the sterner\r\nvirtues have decayed. Increased production and export enriched the\r\npeople, a gold coinage was introduced, and the friars allowed avarice\r\nto possess their souls.\r\n\r\nIn those lands of perpetual summer no death duties have to be paid\r\nto a Chancellor of the Exchequer, as in this island of fog and mist.\r\n\r\nBut the friars have a system of charges for performing the funeral\r\nceremonies, which comes to much the same in the end. I call it a\r\nsystem; it is a very simple system, and consists in extorting as\r\nmuch as they can get, taking into consideration the wealth of the\r\nfamily. To give an instance, I have been assured by a son of Capitan\r\nNatalio Lopez, of Balayan, a native gentleman well known to me,\r\nthat the parish priest charged the family six hundred dollars for\r\nperforming their father's funeral ceremony. The same rule applies to\r\nbaptisms and marriages, and this abuse calls for redress, and for the\r\nestablishment of fixed fees according to the position of the parties.\r\n\r\nEach friar, as a parish priest, was an outpost of the central\r\ngovernment, watching for symptoms of revolt. Only thus could the\r\nSpaniards hold the archipelago with fifteen hundred Peninsular troops,\r\nand a small squadron of warships.\r\n\r\nThe greatest, and the best-founded, complaint of the natives against\r\nthe priests, was that whoever displeased them, either in personal\r\nor money matters, was liable to be denounced to the authorities as\r\na filibuster, and to be torn from home and family and deported to\r\nsome distant and probably unhealthy spot, there to reside, at his own\r\ncost, for an indefinite time, by arbitrary authority, without process\r\nof law. Such a punishment, euphoniously termed \"forced residence,\"\r\nsometimes involved the death of the exile, and always caused heavy\r\nexpense, as a pardon could not be obtained without bribing some one.\r\n\r\nYsabelo de los Reyes, and other natives, accuse the friars of extorting\r\nevidence from suspected persons by torture. I fear there can be no\r\ndoubt that many victims, including a number of the native clerics,\r\nsuffered flagellation and other tortures at the hands of the friars\r\nfor the above purpose. The convents of Nueva-Caceres and of Vigan,\r\namongst other places, were the scenes of these abominable practices,\r\nand Augustinians, Dominicans and Franciscans, have taken part in\r\nthem. This is referred to at greater length in another part of this\r\nwork under the heading, \"The Insurrection of 1896.\"\r\n\r\nIndividual friars were sometimes, nay, often, very worthy parish\r\npriests. I have known many such. But a community is often worse\r\nthan the individuals of which it is composed. One might say with\r\nthe Italian musician who had served for many years in a cathedral,\r\nand had obtained the promise of every individual canon to support\r\nhis application for a pension, when he was told that the chapter had\r\nunanimously refused his request:\r\n\r\n\"The canons are good, but the chapter is bad.\"\r\n\r\nA board will jointly do a meaner action than the shadiest director\r\namongst them, and should it comprise one or two members of obtrusive\r\npiety, that circumstance enables it to disregard the ordinary standard\r\nof right and wrong with more assurance.\r\n\r\nThere is a law in metallurgy which has a curious analogy to this law\r\nof human nature. It is this: An alloy composed of several metals of\r\ndifferent melting-points, will fuse at a lower temperature than that\r\nof its lowest fusing constituent.\r\n\r\nThe Orders, then, have been of the greatest service in the past; they\r\nhave brought the Philippines and their inhabitants to a certain pitch\r\nof civilisation, and credit is due to them for this much, even if\r\nthey could go no farther. For years their influence over the natives\r\nhas been decreasing, and year by year the natives have become more\r\nand more antagonistic to priestly rule.\r\n\r\nA considerable intellectual development has taken place of late years\r\nin the Philippines. The natives are no longer content to continue\r\nupon the old lines; they aspire to a freer life. Many even harbour\r\na sentiment of nationality such as was never thought of before.\r\n\r\nBut if the Orders had lost ground with the natives and with many\r\nSpaniards, their influence still preponderated. Owners of vast estates,\r\npossessors of fabulous riches, armed with spiritual authority, knowing\r\nthe secrets of every family, holding the venal courts of justice as in\r\nthe hollow of their hand, dominating the local government, standing\r\nabove the law, and purchasing the downfall of their enemies from the\r\ncorrupt ministries in Madrid, these giant trusts, jealous of each\r\nother, yet standing firmly shoulder to shoulder in the common cause,\r\nconstitute a barrier to progress that can have no place nor use under\r\nan American Protectorate. They are an anachronism in the twentieth\r\ncentury, and they must disappear as corporations from the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThey should not, however, be buried under an avalanche of contumely\r\nand slander; their long and glorious past should be remembered, and in\r\nwinding up their estates due regard should be paid to the interests\r\nof every member. I cannot here intimate how this is to be done, for\r\nit is an intricate subject, rendered more complex by the reluctance\r\nof the American Government to interfere in religious matters, even\r\nthough they are so bound up with the politics of the Philippines that\r\nno pacification can be effected without following popular sentiment\r\nupon this point.\r\n\r\nSo far as the landed estates are concerned, the settlement could\r\nbe arrived at by a commission with ample powers. In the meantime,\r\nno sale of these estates should be recognised.\r\n\r\nThe benefices held by the friars should be gradually bestowed upon\r\nthe secular clergy, as suitable men can be found. The native clergy\r\nhave always been badly used by the friars; they have had to suffer\r\nabuse and ignominious treatment. They have not been in a position to\r\ndevelop their dignity and self-respect.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of them in general as leaving something to be desired\r\nas to decorous conduct, but they will doubtless improve when placed\r\nin positions of consideration and responsibility.\r\n\r\nAmongst them are men of considerable learning; some have passed\r\nbrilliant examinations in theology and canon law.\r\n\r\nAs regards piety, Malays, whether heathen, Mahometan or Christian,\r\ntake their religion lightly, and we must not expect too much. I\r\ndaresay they are pious enough for the country and the climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSECRET SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n    Masonic Lodges--Execution or exile of Masons in 1872--The\r\n    \"Associacion Hispano Filipina\"--The \"Liga Filipina\"--The\r\n    Katipunan--Its programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nFray Eduardo Navarro, Procurator of the Augustinians, and Ysabelo de\r\nlos Reyes, an Ilocano, and author of some notable works, agree that\r\nthe first masonic lodge of the Philippines was founded in Cavite\r\nabout 1860. The latter states that Malcampo and Mendez-Nunez,\r\ntwo distinguished naval officers, were the founders. Soon after\r\nthis, another lodge was founded in Zamboanga, also under naval\r\nauspices. After 1868, a lodge was founded in Manila by foreigners,\r\na wealthy Filipino being secretary. Another lodge was founded in\r\nPandakan, another in Cebu, and still another in Cavite, to which\r\nCrisanto Reyes and Maximo Inocencio belonged.\r\n\r\nThese lodges at first had only Peninsular Spaniards or other Europeans\r\nas members, but gradually Creoles, Mestizos, and natives, joined the\r\nbrotherhood, and subscribed liberally to its funds.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic clergy have always looked upon Masons as most dangerous\r\nenemies, and many pontiffs have launched their anathemas against the\r\nbrotherhood. But, so far as one can see, to quote from 'The Jackdaw\r\nof Rheims,' \"No one seemed a penny the worse.\"\r\n\r\nMasonry grows and flourishes in spite of them all. To give an\r\nexample. Many years ago, in the very Catholic city of Lima, I attended\r\nthe civil funeral of a priest, the learned Doctor Don Francisco de\r\nPaula Gonzales Vigil, who died excommunicate. Twelve thousand men,\r\nincluding the Masons with their insignia, deputations from the Senate\r\nand Chamber, from the Municipality, Army, Navy, and other bodies,\r\nformed the funeral cortege. The Municipality presented a tomb in the\r\npublic cemetery, which is one of the finest in the world, and an orator\r\npronounced an impassioned eulogy upon the virtues and patriotism of the\r\ndeceased. It was a wonderful manifestation, and remains graven upon my\r\nmemory. On that day every priest and friar found something to occupy\r\nhimself with at home. Whatever may be the case in Great Britain or in\r\nthe United States, there can be no doubt that in Catholic countries\r\nthe lodges are antagonistic to the clergy and the Church.\r\n\r\nThe lodges in the Philippines were founded by anti-clerical Spaniards\r\nof liberal views, and the Creoles, Mestizos and natives who joined\r\nthem found brethren disposed to sympathise with them and to work with\r\nthem against the friars. There was no idea of revolting against the\r\nmother country, but rather to introduce a more liberal government,\r\nwith representation for the civilised provinces in the Spanish\r\nCortes. It must be remembered that this representation had already\r\nexisted, and only required to be revived. There had been deputies\r\nto the Cortes-Generales from 1810 to 1814, and from 1820 to 1823,\r\nand Procuradores from 1834 to 1837.\r\n\r\nThe Cortes of Cadiz, on 14th October, 1810, declared:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"The kingdoms and provinces of America and Asia are, and ought to\r\n    have been always, reputed an integral part of the Spanish monarchy,\r\n    and for that same, their natives and free inhabitants are equal\r\n    in rights and privileges to those of the peninsula.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are very noble words, and, delivered in the majestic language\r\nof Castile by some enthusiastic orator, must have gone straight to\r\nthe hearts of those that heard them.\r\n\r\nSpain is as celebrated for orators as Great Britain for the lack of\r\nthem. Our generation has never produced a speaker like Castelar. But,\r\nunfortunately for the Philippines, these grand and sonorous phrases\r\ndissolved in air, and led to nothing practical. The friars stoutly\r\nopposed what to them seemed dangerous innovations; they were\r\nsuccessful, and darkness again prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection of Cavite, in 1872, resulted in the execution or\r\nexile of many members of the masonic body, and the brotherhood was\r\nfor some years under a cloud.\r\n\r\nThe Peninsular Spaniards dissociated themselves from the revolutionary\r\nparty. To use a simile which has been employed in England to describe\r\nthe difference between Liberals and Radicals, they were \"going by\r\nthe same train, but not going so far.\"\r\n\r\nThe Creoles and Mestizos gradually founded new societies, which were\r\nalleged to aim at obtaining reforms by legal and constitutional means.\r\n\r\n\"The Asociacion Hispano-Filipina\" had for its first president Doroteo\r\nCortes, and amongst its officers Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, Pedro\r\nSerrano, and Deodato Arellano.\r\n\r\nThe \"Liga Filipina\" was founded by Dr. Rizal and Domingo Franco;\r\nits first president was shot. Nearly all the members were Masons;\r\nthey were well off, and of fair education, not inclined to put their\r\npersons or property in danger. They did not want to fight. Their\r\nprogramme may be summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Expulsion of the friars, and confiscation of their estates.\r\n    2. The same political, administrative and economical concessions\r\n       as had been granted to Cuba. Freedom of the press, and freedom\r\n       of association.\r\n    3. Equalisation of the Philippine and Peninsular armies, and a\r\n       just division of Civil Service posts between natives and\r\n       Spaniards.\r\n    4. Return to owners of lands usurped by the friars, and sale of\r\n       such lands as really belonged to the Orders.\r\n    5. Prevention of insults to the Philippine natives, either in\r\n       sermons or in the press.\r\n    6. Economy in expenditure. Reduction of imposts. Construction of\r\n       railways and public works.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was certainly not without risk to be a member of one of these\r\nsocieties, for the Orders are vindictive in the extreme, and are not\r\ntroubled with scruples when it is a question of punishing an opponent.\r\n\r\nStill, the Creole and Mestizo element were made cautious by\r\nthe possession of property, and its members cannot be called\r\nfighting-men. They did not intend to run the risk of having holes\r\nbored through them.\r\n\r\nThey founded newspapers in Spain; they wrote violent articles,\r\nthey made speeches, they obtained the support of some Liberals and\r\nanti-clericals in the Peninsula, and numbered many adherents in the\r\nislands. Still, they were comparatively harmless. Not so, however,\r\nwas a society which was formed of very different elements. Taking a\r\nhint, perhaps, from the murderous brotherhood of the Ku-Klux-Klan,\r\nsome resolute and courageous Tagals imagined and formed that terrible\r\nsecret society, the Katipunan. There is no K in the Spanish alphabet,\r\nbut this letter is found in the Malay dialects, and consequently\r\nin Tagal. Therefore, the symbol of the society, K.K.K., was as\r\ndistinctly anti-Spanish as was the full title, which was represented\r\nby the initials--\r\n\r\n\r\n                               N M A N B\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words corresponding to these initials were:--\r\n\r\n\r\n            Kataas-taasan   Kagalang-galang   Katipunan\r\n        or  Sovereign       Worshipful        Association\r\n\r\n            Nang     Manga     Anac  Nang     Bayan\r\n            of the   (plural)  sons  of the   Country.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey used signs and passwords. There were three grades of members:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        1st grade   Katipun     word Anak nang bayan.\r\n        2nd grade   Kanal       word Gom-bur-za. [8]\r\n        3rd grade   Bayani.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndres Bonifacio, a warehouse-keeper in the service of Messrs. Fressel\r\n& Co., of Manila, was the guiding spirit of this society, and at\r\nthe meeting of 1st January, 1896, the Supreme Council was elected\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        President             Andres Bonifacio.\r\n        Fiscal and Doctor     Emilio Jacinto o Dison, alias Ping Kian.\r\n        Treasurer             Vicente Molina.\r\n        Councillors           Pantaleon Torres.\r\n                              Hermengildo Reyes.\r\n                              Francisco Carreon.\r\n                              Jose Trinidad.\r\n                              Balbino Florentine\r\n                              Aguedo del Rosario.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   K\r\n                                  K K\r\n                                 Z LL B\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of the Katipunan were poor people--writers, common\r\nsoldiers, washermen, mechanics, and tenants on the friars'\r\nestates. They subscribed small sums monthly for the purchase of arms,\r\nand for other expenses. Bearing in mind how many conspiracies had been\r\ndenounced to the priests by the women, the leaders of this movement\r\ngave their meetings the outward appearance of benevolent associations,\r\nand directed the members to represent the society to their wives in\r\nthat light.\r\n\r\nLater on a woman's lodge, with twenty-five members was organised,\r\nunder the presidency of Marina Dison, but the women were not informed\r\nof the true object of the society.\r\n\r\nFray Eduardo Navarro, Procurator of the Augustinians, in a\r\ncleverly-written work, entitled 'The Philippines; a Study of Certain\r\nMatters of Moment,' published in 1897, prints under No. 3 of the\r\nAppendix the title granted by the Walana Lodge, No. 158, certifying\r\nthat \"our dear sister, Purificacion Leyva, has been initiated in the\r\ndegree of Companion-Mason at the session of 8th April, 1894.\"\r\n\r\nOn reading this work, I infer that the friars considered the Katipunan\r\na Masonic body, but this is a mistake. The Katipunan adopted some\r\nof the Masonic paraphernalia, and some of the initiatory ceremonies,\r\nbut were in no sense Masonic lodges.\r\n\r\nThe programme of the Katipunan was, in its own words, \"to redeem the\r\nPhilippines from its tyrants, the friars, and to found a communistic\r\nrepublic.\" This was simple and direct, and they meant it.\r\n\r\nHow many men were affiliated to this society cannot be known. Estimates\r\nrange from 10,000 to 50,000 members. I think there can be no doubt\r\nthat it was the most potent factor in the insurrection of 1896, and\r\nthat its members, unlike the Creoles and Mestizos, were ready to give\r\ntheir lives for their cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE INSURRECTION OF 1896-97.\r\n\r\n    Combat at San Juan del Monte--Insurrection spreading--Arrival\r\n    of reinforcements from Spain--Rebel entrenchments--Rebel arms\r\n    and artillery--Spaniards repulsed from Binacayan--and from\r\n    Noveleta--Mutiny of Carabineros--Prisoners at Cavite attempt\r\n    to escape--Iniquities of the Spanish War Office--Lachambre's\r\n    division--Rebel organization--Rank and badges--Lachambre\r\n    advances--He captures Silang--Perez Dasmarinas--Salitran--Anabo II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Augustinians take credit to themselves that one of their order,\r\nFather Mariano Gil, parish priest of Tondo, discovered the existence\r\nof the revolutionary conspiracy, on the 19th August. But already on\r\nthe 5th of July a lieutenant of the Guardia Civil had declared in\r\na written report that there were over 14,000 men belonging to the\r\nvalley of the Pasig, affiliated to the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nA council of the authorities was convened on the 6th of August, but\r\nnothing was done. On that same date, however, the Governor of Batangas\r\ntelegraphed that a discovery of arms, ammunition and Republican flags\r\nhad been made at Taal. In consequence of this, General Blanco ordered\r\nsome arrests to be made.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, Father Gil gave information to General Blanco that\r\nhe had discovered the existence of a secret revolutionary society,\r\nand two days later Blanco reported to the Government in Madrid that\r\nthere existed a vast organization of secret societies.\r\n\r\nAt this time the garrison of Manila consisted of some 1500 men, most of\r\nthem being natives. As arrests were being continually made, the members\r\nof the Katipunan, or those suspected of being such, left their homes\r\nand took to the woods although very poorly equipped with fire-arms.\r\n\r\nOn 30th August a party of the rebels under Sancho Valenzuela,\r\nModesto Sarmiento, and others had a fight with some native cavalry\r\nand Guardias Civiles at San Juan del Monte near Manila. The rebels\r\nlost heavily in killed, their chiefs were taken prisoners and shot\r\non the 4th September, at the Paseo de la Luneta.\r\n\r\nA Spanish artilleryman was murdered by some rebels at Pandacan about\r\nthis time, and martial law was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe Guardia Civil, all native soldiers, was now concentrated in\r\nManila abandoning their outlying posts. After many vacillations and\r\ncontradictory cablegrams to the Government in Madrid, General Blanco\r\nnow definitely asked for large reinforcements.\r\n\r\nOn September 1st, the people of Noveleta revolted and killed a captain\r\nand a lieutenant of the Guardia Civil and three days later the rebels\r\npenetrated to the town of Caridad, close to Cavite.\r\n\r\nEarly in September rebels were in arms, and dominating great part\r\nof the Provinces of Manila, Cavite, Batangas, Bulacan, Pampanga and\r\nNueva Ecija.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the month rebel bands appeared in Tarlac, Pangasinan,\r\nLaguna, Morong and Tayabas.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th September, the Cavite rebels attacked San Roque, which is\r\nclose to the town of Cavite, and burned part of it. On the 12th,\r\nthirteen persons who had been convicted by a court-martial of\r\ncomplicity in the revolt were shot in Cavite.\r\n\r\nThe cables from General Blanco to the Madrid Government were all this\r\ntime misleading and contradictory, and showed that he had no grasp\r\nof the state of affairs. These dispatches were subjected to severe\r\ncriticism in the Heraldo, a Madrid newspaper.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of September troops arrived from Zamboanga and other\r\nsouthern stations, and the garrison of Manila was brought up to\r\n6000 men, two-thirds of whom were natives. Reinforcements were sent\r\nto Cavite, for the rebels were in great force about Silang, Imus,\r\nand Noveleta.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th September another attack was made by the rebels on San\r\nRoque, but was repulsed.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st October the mail steamer Cataluna arrived with a battalion\r\nof marines from Spain, greatly to the delight of the Spaniards,\r\nwho gave the force an enthusiastic reception.\r\n\r\nNext day the ss. Monserrat arrived with more troops, and from this\r\ntime forward troops kept pouring in.\r\n\r\nStill General Blanco remained on the defensive in and around the city\r\nof Manila and the town of Cavite, and repulsed attacks made by the\r\nrebels on the magazines at Binancayan and Las Pinas.\r\n\r\nThe rebels were now firmly established over the rest of the Province\r\nof Cavite. The natural features of this part of Luzon made the\r\nmovements of regular troops extremely difficult. The country\r\nabounds in rivers which run from south to north parallel to each\r\nother at short distances. They run at the bottom of deep ravines,\r\nwhich present excellent positions for defence. Many of these rivers\r\nhave dams across them and the sluices in these might be opened by\r\nthe defenders, or the dams could be blown up in case a column of the\r\nassailants should be entangled in the ravine below, when they would\r\ninevitably be overwhelmed in the descending torrent.\r\n\r\nIn places the country could be flooded and thus be rendered impassable\r\nfor troops.\r\n\r\nBut the industry of the rebels, skilfully directed, had added\r\nenormously to these natural advantages. From the reports of\r\neye-witnesses I can affirm that the entrenchments of the Tagals were\r\ncolossal. Tagals and Boers have demonstrated that a competitive\r\nexamination is not necessary to enable fighting-men to entrench\r\nthemselves. The Tagal lines ran from the delta of the Zapote River to\r\nNaic in an almost unbroken line, approximately parallel to the coast.\r\n\r\nThey were doubled and trebled in front of villages or towns and across\r\nthe roads.\r\n\r\nThe trace was en cremaillere, the section being 6 feet thick at the\r\ntop and 8 feet high, the exterior face vertical, with a revetment\r\nof bamboos fastened together with rattans. It was in fact a bank of\r\nearth built up against a strong bamboo fence.\r\n\r\nThe defenders fired through loop-holes left in the parapet, and were\r\nvery well covered, but they could only fire straight before them\r\nand horizontally.\r\n\r\nThe defences of the towns had thicker and loftier parapets; in some\r\ncases there were three tiers of loop-holes properly splayed.\r\n\r\nThe insurgents were very insufficiently armed, and at first there were\r\nten men to a rifle. The man who was reputed the best shot carried\r\nthe rifle and cartridge belt, and if he was killed or wounded in\r\nan engagement, the next best shot took the weapon and continued the\r\nfight. In the early actions there was scarcely ever a rifle left on\r\nthe ground by the insurgents.\r\n\r\nThe only cannon the rebels had at first were some ancient brass\r\nswivel guns called falconetes or lantacas, which they took from the\r\nestate-houses at Imus and Malabon.\r\n\r\nThey also had some brass mortars like quart pots, which are used\r\nfor firing salutes on feast days. These they fastened at an angle\r\nto blocks of wood, thus making small howitzers, quite effective at\r\nshort range. They loaded these with the punchings from boiler-plates\r\nand broken cooking-pots.\r\n\r\nThey showed a considerable ingenuity in making cannon out of any\r\nmaterials at hand. They would take a steel boiler-tube, a stay tube\r\nfor choice, say about three inches bore and a quarter of an inch\r\nthick. Plugging up one end and drilling a touch-hole, they would\r\ndrive this tube into a hole bored in a log of hard wood turned on the\r\noutside to a taper, then they drove eight or nine wrought-iron rings\r\nover the wood. They drilled through the wood to suit the touch-hole\r\nand the gun was ready.\r\n\r\nThey fitted no trunnions, but mounted this rude cannon upon a solid\r\nblock of wood.\r\n\r\nIn other cases they made some wire guns by lapping steel boiler-tubes\r\nwith telegraph-wire.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the campaign of Lachambre's division against the\r\nrebels, some modern field-pieces of eight centimetres were captured\r\nfrom them, but it is not clear where these came from.\r\n\r\nTo supplement their scanty stock of rifles, they made some hand-guns\r\nof gas-tube. These were fired by applying a match or lighted cigar\r\nto the touch-hole, and would seem to be very clumsy weapons. But I\r\nmay say that when on a visit to the estate of Palpa, in Peru, I saw a\r\nChinaman who was in charge of the poultry corral, kill a hawk hovering,\r\nwith a similar gun.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Military and Naval Authorities now took the revolt very\r\nseriously, and on the 8th November the squadron comprising the\r\nCastilla, Reina Cristina, and other vessels, and the guns of the\r\nforts at Cavite and Puerto Vaga, opened upon the rebel position at\r\nCavite, Viejo, Noveleta, Binancayan, and other places within range,\r\nand kept it up for hours. The next morning the firing was resumed\r\nat daylight, supplemented by the guns from launches and boats well\r\ninshore. Troops were landed under the protection of the squadron,\r\nand advanced against the entrenchments of Binancayan. They delivered\r\nthree frontal attacks with great gallantry, reaching the parapet each\r\ntime, but were beaten back, leaving many dead upon the ground. No\r\nflanking attack was possible here for the parapet extended for many\r\nmiles each way.\r\n\r\nA simultaneous attack was made upon Noveleta by a column of 3000\r\nSpanish and native infantry under Colonel Fermin Diaz Mattoni.\r\n\r\nThis force started from Cavite and marched through Dalahican and\r\nalong the road to Noveleta. This road is a raised causeway running\r\nthrough a mangrove swamp, having deep mud on each side impassable\r\nfor troops. This is at least a mile of swamp, and the troops advanced\r\nalong the causeway and crossed a bridge which spanned a muddy creek.\r\n\r\nNo enemy was in sight, and the town was not far off. Suddenly the\r\nhead of the column fell into a most cunningly devised pitfall. The\r\nroad had been dug out, the pit covered with wattle, and the surface\r\nrestored to its original appearance. The bottom of the pit was set\r\nwith pointed bamboo stakes which inflicted serious wounds upon those\r\nthat fell upon them.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of confusion the rebels opened a withering fire from\r\nconcealed positions amongst the mangroves upon the column standing\r\nin the open.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards and native troops made great efforts to get forward,\r\nbut could not stand the fire and had to retire. When they got back\r\nto the bridge it was down, and they had to wade across the creek\r\nunder a close fire from the rebels hidden amongst the mangroves. In\r\nthis action the Spaniards are said to have lost 600 killed and many\r\nhundreds wounded. The loss fell principally on the 73rd and 74th\r\nRegiments of Native Infantry.\r\n\r\nThe rebels were greatly encouraged, and got possession of a large\r\nnumber of rifles, with ammunition and accoutrements.\r\n\r\nBoth these attacks were made under the direction of General Blanco,\r\nwho witnessed them from a lofty staging erected within the lines of\r\nDalahican. After these disasters he resumed the defensive, except that\r\nthe squadron and the batteries at Cavite and Puerto Vaga frequently\r\nbombarded the rebel positions.\r\n\r\nAt this time thousands of natives were in prison in Manila awaiting\r\ntheir trial. A permanent court-martial had been organised to try the\r\nsuspects. Great numbers were shot, and many hundreds were transported\r\nto the Caroline Islands, to Ceuta, and Fernando Po. Wealthy natives\r\nwere mercilessly blackmailed, and it is reported that those who were\r\ndischarged had to pay large sums for their release.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Volunteers in Manila committed many arbitrary and even\r\noutrageous actions, and aroused the hatred of the natives far more\r\nthan the regular troops did. They allowed their patriotism to carry\r\nthem into most lamentable excesses.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th February a rising and mutiny of the Carbineers or\r\nCustom-House Guards took place in Manila at the captain of the port's\r\noffice. The scheme miscarried and was only partially successful. The\r\nofficer on duty was shot, and also the sergeant, and the rebels made\r\noff with some rifles and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers and some troops hastily called together pursued the\r\nrebels through Tondo as far as the Leper Hospital, till nightfall,\r\nthe last volley being fired at 6.15 P.M. In this affair the mutineers\r\nlost a great many men, but some of them got away and joined the rebels.\r\n\r\nBlanco had not been severe enough with the rebels or suspected\r\nrebels to please the friars. His management of the attacks upon\r\nNoveleta and Binancayan had been faulty, and his health was bad. It\r\nwas not surprising, having the priests against him, and the military\r\ndissatisfied, that he was recalled. He left at the end of 1896. General\r\nPolavieja, an officer who had risen from the ranks by his military\r\ntalents, and who, when serving in Cuba, had very accurately gauged the\r\nsituation, and had made a remarkably clever report to the government,\r\nwas sent out to replace Blanco. Polavieja was inexorable with the\r\nrebels and their sympathisers. Military executions took place about\r\nonce a week for two months. Francisco Roxas, a mestizo ship-owner,\r\nNumeriano Adriano, and many other mestizos and natives were shot at\r\nthe Paseo de la Luneta.\r\n\r\nOn December 6th the prisoners in Cavite jail rose, murdered their\r\njailer, and attempted to escape. One hundred and fifty prisoners were\r\nconcerned in this affair. Of these, forty-seven were shot in the\r\nstreets of the town, and twenty-one were captured, whilst thirteen\r\nwere shot in the bushes behind Canacao. Those recaptured were tried\r\nfor prison-breaking, and were all shot the next morning.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1897, a large number of troops had arrived from\r\nSpain. They were, however, largely conscripts, raw youths who had never\r\nhandled a rifle, mere raw material in fact, sent out without uniform\r\nor equipment, many having only what they stood up in, or at most,\r\nhaving a spare shirt and a singlet tied up in a handkerchief. We talk\r\nabout the shortcomings of our War Office officials, and certainly\r\nthey sometimes give examples of wooden-headed stupidity, and are\r\nbehind the age in many particulars. But for deliberate inhumanity,\r\nfor utter callousness to human suffering, to loss of health and\r\nlife, I think the Spanish War Office could hardly be outdone. And I\r\nspeak of their misdeeds from personal knowledge in the Philippines\r\nand in Cuba. What an enormous amount of suffering was caused to the\r\nworking-people of Spain by the sending to Cuba and to the Philippines\r\nof over 200,000 men in 1895-96. Never in this generation were men\r\nshipped away so destitute of clothing, provisions, surgeons and\r\nmedical comforts. Never have I seen troops in the field with such\r\nwretched equipment, or so devoid of transport, tents, and supplies.\r\n\r\nWhatever successes they achieved were secured by the inborn valour of\r\nthe troops, and by extraordinary exertions on the part of the generals\r\nand staff to improvise on the spot what the national treasury should\r\nhave supplied them with at the commencement of hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe raw recruits having been drilled and exercised with the rifle were\r\norganised in fifteen battalions and called Cazadores (chasseurs). These\r\nbattalions, with four regiments of native infantry and some native\r\nvolunteers, were formed into brigades under Generals Cornell, Marina,\r\nJaramillo and Galbis. The first three brigades constituted a division,\r\nwhich was placed under the command of General Lachambre, an officer\r\nof great energy, and of long experience in the Cuban wars.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1897 the Tagal rebellion had concentrated its\r\nforces in the province of Cavite. Embers of rebellion still smouldered\r\nin other provinces of Luzon, but many rebels from outlying places\r\nhad thrown in their lot with those of Cavite, and in great numbers,\r\nvery indifferently supplied with arms and ammunition, but amply with\r\nprovisions, they confidently awaited the long-prepared attack of\r\nthe Spanish forces behind the formidable entrenchments that their\r\npersevering labour had raised. In the interval they had organised\r\nthemselves after a fashion, and had instituted a reign of terror\r\nwherever they held sway.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the rebels in the province of Cavite was of a\r\nsomewhat confused nature, and seemed to respond to the ambition and\r\ninfluence of particular individuals rather than to any systematic\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThus Silang was declared a vice-royalty under Victor Belarmino,\r\nstyled Victor I.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the province was divided into two districts, each ruled\r\nby a council; the first was Imus and its vicinity, under Bernardino\r\nAguinaldo with ministers of war, of the treasury, of agriculture and\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nThe second was San Francisco de Malabon, presided over by Mariano\r\nAlvarez, with ministers of state as above.\r\n\r\nBut above the kingdom of Silang and the two republics, the President\r\nof the Katipunan, Andres Bonifacio, held sway as lieutenant of the\r\nGeneralissimo Emilio Aguinaldo. He resided in his palace at San\r\nFrancisco, and from there dictated his orders. The supreme power was\r\nin the hands of Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\nAll these authorities exercised despotic power, and certainly\r\nill-treated and robbed their own countrymen who did not desire to\r\njoin them, far more than the Spaniards have ever done in the worst\r\nof times. They frequently inflicted the death-penalty, and their\r\nso-called courts-martial no more thought of acquitting an accused\r\nperson than a regimental court-martial in England would. The terrible\r\nPresident of the Katipunan ultimately became a victim of one of these\r\nblood-thirsty tribunals.\r\n\r\nTheir military organization was curious. The province was sub-divided\r\ninto military zones. First Silang, second Imus, third Bacoor, fourth\r\nSan Francisco de Malabon, fifth Alfonso. Each zone had an army which\r\nconsisted of all the population able to work, and was divided into two\r\nparts, the active or fighting force and the auxiliary but non-combatant\r\npart. The active force was divided into regiments and companies, and\r\nthese last into riflemen and spearmen, there being commonly five of\r\nthe latter to one of the former. Besides the usual military ranks,\r\nthey instituted the following functionaries:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Minister of Marine                   Marcelo de los Santos.\r\n    Principal Chaplain to the Forces     Eladio Almeyda.\r\n    Intendant-General of Taxes           Silvestre Aguinaldo.\r\n    General of Artillery                 Crispulo Aguinaldo.\r\n    Inspector of Ordnance Factories      Edilberto Evangelista.\r\n    General of Engineers\r\n    Judge Advocate General               Santos Nocon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the above held the rank of lieutenant-general. The badges of rank\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nRebel Badges of Rank.\r\n\r\nGeneralissimo,          K on the hat or cap.\r\n                        Z. L. I. B. on the arm.\r\n                        Vertically stacked Maltese cross, K, and Maltese\r\n                        cross on the left breast.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Generals,    K in concentric circles with eight segments.\r\n\r\nMarshals,               K in lower half of concentric circles.\r\n\r\nBrigadiers,             K in triangle with circle at each corner.\r\n\r\nColonels,               Three K's surrounding Maltese cross.\r\n\r\n                        K\r\nMajors,                 K\r\n                        K\r\n\r\nThe Ministers,          K\r\n\r\nThe Secretary to the\r\nGeneralissimo,          K K K\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rebels occupied the whole of the province of Cavite, except the\r\nfortified town of that name containing the naval arsenal, and a small\r\nstrip on the shores of the Laguna where the Spanish troops were posted.\r\n\r\nCornell's brigade was at Calamba and Marina's brigade at Binan. They\r\nhad outlying detachments amounting to 1500 men at Santa Cruz, Santo\r\nDomingo, Tayabas, and along the line from Tanauan to Banadero, leaving\r\neach brigade 4000 men for the advance into the rebel territory. The\r\ndivisional troops numbered about 1300, making a total of 9300\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\nThe brigade under Jaramillo had its headquarters in Taal, Batangas\r\nProvince, with outlying detachments at Batangas, Calaca, Lian Balayan\r\nand Punta Santiago, and a force holding the line of the Pansipit River,\r\naltogether amounting to 1000 men, leaving 1600 free to operate.\r\n\r\nBesides this a fourth brigade, not belonging to the division,\r\nhaving General Galbis as brigadier, was extended along the northern\r\nbank of the Zapote River, under the immediate orders of the\r\ngovernor-general. The Lakes of Bay and Bombon (Taal) were guarded\r\nby armed steam-launches and other small craft, whilst the gunboats\r\nof the squadron patrolled the sea coast. The rebel province was thus\r\nheld in a grip of iron.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th February, 1897, General Lachambre reported himself ready\r\nto advance. General Polavieja ordered Jaramillo to attack the rebel\r\ntrenches at Bayuyungan on the 14th, and to keep up the attack until\r\nLachambre had seized Silang, when he was to attack Talisay on the Lake\r\nof Taal. The marines at Dalahican were ordered to attack Noveleta,\r\nwhilst Lachambre was to advance on the 15th, the two brigades taking\r\ndifferent routes, but converging on Silang.\r\n\r\nThe march was extremely difficult, and the nine-centimetre guns were\r\nonly taken through, at the cost of most strenuous efforts. The enemy\r\ntenaciously defended every favourable position, and were only driven\r\noff at the cost of many lives.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th, Silang, one of the principal rebel towns, was taken\r\nby assault and at the point of the bayonet, after a preparatory\r\nbombardment in which the artillery fired 105 rounds of shell, whilst\r\n25,000 rifle cartridges were used by the infantry.\r\n\r\nThe rebels lost 2000 men killed and wounded, whilst the Spanish losses\r\nwere 12 killed and 70 wounded. The town was strongly entrenched and\r\nstoutly defended, and its capture with so small a loss may justly\r\nbe called a creditable operation. Marina's brigade attacked from the\r\nsouth and Cornell's brigade from the east.\r\n\r\nThe action lasted from 7 to 11.30 A.M. The rebels were discouraged,\r\nbut still, on the 22nd, they delivered an attack as if they would\r\nretake the town, and pressed on with great fury. They killed four of\r\nthe Spaniards and wounded twenty-one, but in the end were driven off,\r\nleaving 400 dead on the ground. The houses in Silang were found fully\r\nfurnished and provisioned. In the house of the so-called Viceroy of\r\nSilang, Victor Belarmino, the principal ornament of the sala was a\r\nchromo-lithograph portrait of the Queen Regent.\r\n\r\nThe church-doors were wide open and the altars profusely\r\nilluminated. On the sacristy table lay the priestly robes and\r\nornaments, ready, doubtless, for the celebration of a Te Deum for the\r\nexpected victory. But he who was to wear them, the celebrated Tagal\r\nBishop, lay with a bullet through his heart across the parapet he\r\nhad fiercely defended.\r\n\r\nLachambre preserved the best houses around the church and convent and\r\nutilised them as storehouses, hospital, and barracks, burning the\r\nrest of the town as a punishment to the rebels. He then garrisoned\r\nand fortified the post and connected it with the telegraph line.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th Lachambre marched from Silang, his main body advancing by\r\nthe direct route to Perez Dasmarinas parallel to the River Casundit,\r\na flanking force of three companies guarding the left of the column,\r\nwhilst Lieutenant Colonel Villalon, with a battalion and a half\r\nhaving started an hour earlier than the main body, took the road to\r\nPalimparan, having the Rio Grande on his right, and by his advance\r\nprotecting the right flank of the column. Villalon advanced rapidly,\r\nand, brushing aside all opposition, rushed Palimparan with a loss\r\nof one killed and one wounded, killing seven of the rebels in the\r\nattack. Here he bivouacked, and at sunset was joined by another\r\nforce consisting of half a brigade under Colonel Arizon, detached\r\nfrom General Galbis' force on the Zapote River.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the main body had advanced to within three miles of\r\nPerez Dasmarinas and bivouacked at the hamlet called Sampalcoc. On\r\nthe following day Perez Dasmarinas was taken by assault, after a\r\nshort bombardment by the mountain batteries. The rebels were strongly\r\nentrenched, and made a stout resistance. They had flooded the rice\r\nfields to the east of the town and rendered them impassable.\r\n\r\nThe town was attacked from the south and west, but it took hours of\r\nhard fighting for the Spaniards to break in, and even then the rebels\r\nfought hand to hand, and many preferred death to surrender. Those\r\nwho fled were taken in flank by Arizon's force, which approached the\r\nnorthern end of the town from the eastward. The loss of the Spaniards\r\nwas 21 killed and 121 wounded, whilst the natives left 400 dead at\r\nthe foot of their defences, and a great number were killed outside\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nThe early part of the defence was directed by Aguinaldo, but he fled\r\nwhen the Spanish forces closed up, leaving Estrella, an ex-sergeant\r\nof the Guardia Civil, in his place. Estrella fled later on when the\r\nSpaniards had entered the town. Unintimidated by this rude lesson,\r\nthe rebels that same night fired into the town, and on the 27th they\r\nattacked a column which went out to make a reconnaissance towards\r\nPalimparan, and gave a mountain battery a chance, which they promptly\r\ntook, of getting at a dense body of them with case. The artillery fired\r\n22 rounds in this action, and the infantry used 63,000 cartridges. The\r\nSpanish loss was two killed and ten wounded, whilst the rebels lost\r\nat least 300.\r\n\r\nThe church, convent, and stone homes round the Plaza of Perez\r\nDasmarinas were loopholed and prepared for defence, and occupied\r\nby a garrison of two companies of infantry. Owing, however, to the\r\ndifficulty of bringing up supplies, the division could not resume its\r\nadvance till the 7th March. Then the division took the eastern road to\r\nImus, whilst the half brigade under Arizon marched by a parallel road\r\non the right flank, which converged upon the Imus road at Salitran,\r\na village with a large stone estate-house belonging to the Recollets,\r\nstrongly entrenched and held by the rebels.\r\n\r\nOn arriving within range two guns of Cornell's brigade opened fire\r\non the estate-house from an eminence, but after the fifth round the\r\nSpanish flag was shown from the house, it having been occupied by\r\nArizon's force arriving from the east after a very slight resistance,\r\nfor the rebels seemed to have no one in command. They had prepared\r\nfor an attack from the east, but when they found the Spaniards\r\narriving in great force upon their right flank, enfilading their\r\nstrong entrenchments, they became demoralised and took to flight.\r\n\r\nThe scouts now reported that a formidable entrenchment a mile and a\r\nquarter long, was occupied by the rebels about a mile north of the\r\nvillage. This entrenchment, called Anabo II., covered both the roads\r\nto Imus, and each flank rested on a deep ravine--the eastern end had\r\na redoubt, and the western end a flanking epaulement.\r\n\r\nThe ground in front was perfectly open, and there was difficulty in\r\nmaking a flanking attack, so General Zabala, with a half brigade,\r\nmade a direct attack. The fighting line gradually advanced, taking\r\nsuch cover as the pilapiles of the rice-fields could give, until they\r\narrived within 100 yards of the parapet, when Zabala, waving high\r\nhis sword, gave the order for the assault, falling a moment after\r\npierced through the breast by a shot from a lantaca. Two captains fell\r\nnear him, but the lieutenants led their companies to the assault;\r\nthe cazadores sprang across the ditch and clambered up the high\r\nparapet with the agility and fury of leopards, bayoneting those of\r\nthe defenders who remained to fight it out, and sending volley after\r\nvolley into those who had taken to flight.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish loss was 11 killed and 33 wounded, whilst 200 of the rebels\r\nwere killed. This heavy loss did not however appear to intimidate them\r\nin the least, for on the 8th they made two desperate attempts to retake\r\nthe position, in both of which they came within close range of the\r\nSpaniards, who poured repeated volleys into them by word of command,\r\nwhilst the mountain-guns played upon them with ease. In this action\r\nthe Spaniards lost 5 killed and 25 wounded, and they calculated the\r\nrebel killed at 300.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE INSURRECTION OF 1896-97--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n    The Division encamps at San Nicolas--Work of the native engineer\r\n    soldiers--The division marches to Salitran--Second action at\r\n    Anabo II.--Crispulo Aguinaldo killed--Storming the entrenchments\r\n    of Anabo I.--Burning of Imus by the rebels--Proclamation by\r\n    General Polavieja--Occupation of Bacoor--Difficult march of the\r\n    division--San Antonio taken by assault--Division in action with\r\n    all its artillery--Capture of Noveleta--San Francisco taken by\r\n    assault--Heavy loss of the Tagals--Losses of the division--The\r\n    division broken up--Monteverde's book--Polavieja returns to\r\n    Spain--Primo de Rivera arrives to take his place--General Monet's\r\n    butcheries--The pact of Biak-na-Bato--The 74th Regiment joins\r\n    the insurgents--The massacre of the Calle Camba--Amnesty for\r\n    torturers--Torture in other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th (March) the division marched to Presa-Molino, which was\r\noccupied that same evening, and leaving three companies of infantry to\r\nguard the position, the division continued its march through a most\r\ndifficult country, arriving in the afternoon on the Zapote River,\r\nin touch with the 4th Brigade, formerly commanded by Galbis and now\r\nby Barraquer.\r\n\r\nFrom there Lachambre with his staff rode over to Paranaque, and\r\nreported himself to the Captain-General Polavieja.\r\n\r\nThe troops encamped on the downs of San Nicolas, one brigade on\r\neach side of the River Zapote. Notwithstanding the comparatively\r\nfavourable emplacement of the camp, the troops and their officers\r\nsuffered severely from the effect of the climate upon frames weakened\r\nby over-exertion, by indifferent nourishment and by sleeping on\r\nthe ground. Malarial fevers, intestinal catarrh, dysentery, and\r\nrheumatism sapped their vitality, whilst nostalgia preyed upon the\r\nyounger soldiers and depressed their spirits. Since the 15th February\r\nthe division had lost in killed, wounded, and invalided, no less than\r\n135 officers, and troops in greater proportion.\r\n\r\nYet still greater exertions were to be required from the soldiers. The\r\n4th Brigade was incorporated in the division, and two additional\r\nbattalions, one from the 3rd Brigade and the other from the Independent\r\nBrigade, brought the number of combatants nearly up to 12,000.\r\n\r\nHaving previously made a practicable road by Almansa to Presa Molino\r\nand Salitran, defended by redoubts at the most difficult fords,\r\nand having organised his transport with such means as the country\r\nafforded, Lachambre again set out, his objective being Imus, but the\r\nattack was to be from Salitran.\r\n\r\nThe work of the native engineer soldiers, and of the 74th Native\r\nRegiment in constructing this road and the redoubts, merits the\r\nhighest praise, and it must be admitted that it is almost impossible\r\nfor an army of white men to carry on a campaign in the Philippines\r\nor in similar territory, without the assistance of native pioneer or\r\nengineer troops.\r\n\r\nThe road being ready, and the convoys of provisions having gone\r\nforward, on the morning of the 22nd March the division started on\r\nits march to Salitran, where it arrived on the evening of the 23rd,\r\nhaving had some sharp skirmishes on the way.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 24th the division set out for Imus, and once more the\r\nformidable trenches and redoubts of Anabo II., restored, strengthened,\r\nand crowded with determined defenders, barred their path. These works\r\nhad once already been taken by assault, and had cost the division\r\nthe loss of the brave General Zabala and other officers and men.\r\n\r\nProtected on each flank by a deep ravine with a river at the bottom,\r\nand with open ground in front, the attack had been rendered more\r\ndifficult by flooding the arable land before the trenches, and the\r\nposition of the rebels was an exceedingly strong one. Lachambre had\r\nto accept a direct attack, but he sent a body of troops forward on\r\neach flank to advance simultaneously and overlap the ends of the\r\nentrenchment.\r\n\r\nThe infantry deployed, the firing line advanced under fire without\r\nstopping to within three hundred yards of the parapet, when\r\nthey halted, taking what cover they could and keeping up a steady\r\nfire. Then the mountain battery was brought up and fired common shell\r\nat close range, breaching the parapet. A rush forward soon brought\r\nthe firing-line within 150 yards of the parapet. General Marina,\r\nwatching the engagement well to the front, had one of his staff\r\nofficers killed at his side; seeing the favourable moment arrive,\r\nhe gave the order for the assault.\r\n\r\nOnce more the troops exhibited their conspicuous bravery. The long\r\nline, led by its officers, dashed forward with the bayonet, the\r\nbugles sounding the charge, and with impetuous speed, soon reached\r\nthe parapet. However terrible the attack, the stout-hearted Tagals\r\nstood firm, disdaining to fly.\r\n\r\nBolo and bayonet clashed, European courage and Malay fury had full\r\nplay, till in the end, as ever in equal numbers and in stand-up fight,\r\nthe European prevailed. Many of the defenders fell, the rest sought\r\nsafety in flight.\r\n\r\nThe engagement lasted two and a half hours without cessation, and\r\nover three hundred rebel dead were counted in or near the works,\r\namongst them was Crispulo Aguinaldo, a brother of General Emilio\r\nAguinaldo. The Spaniards lost 9 killed and 108 wounded.\r\n\r\nAfter a short rest the division resumed the advance upon Imus, and\r\nbivouacked after marching about a couple of miles.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th the advance was continued on a broad front. Scarcely had\r\nthe division marched for half-an-hour when the leading ranks came\r\nin sight of another line of entrenchments more than two miles long,\r\nsix feet high, and five feet thick, well protected with cane fences in\r\nfront, one of these being at a distance of 100 yards from the parapet.\r\n\r\nLachambre orders the centre to make a direct attack and the wings a\r\nflanking movement. The rebels retain their fire till the Spaniards\r\narrive within two hundred yards, and then the parapet is crowned with\r\nflame both from small arms and lantacas. The scene of the day before\r\nwas repeated, the parapet stormed, with a rebel loss of over six\r\nhundred. After a short halt the advance against Imus was resumed. The\r\ndistance was short, and the appearance of the thousands of bayonets\r\nand the explosion of a few shells produced an indescribable panic\r\namongst the inhabitants and the many who had come from other towns\r\nto assist in the defence.\r\n\r\nThey took to flight, disregarding the protests of their leaders\r\nEmilio Aguinaldo and Andres Bonifacio. In order to cover his retreat,\r\nthe former ordered the magazine to be blown up and the town to be\r\nburned. This delayed the advance of the Spaniards in the centre, but\r\nthe wings moved forward and the thousands of fugitives were exposed to\r\na flanking fire, and more than eight hundred of them bit the dust. It\r\nwas afternoon before Lachambre could enter what remained of Imus,\r\nwhen as a mark of honour for their splendid services, the colour\r\nof the 74th Regiment of Native Infantry was raised upon the tower\r\nof the church--all the troops presenting arms and afterwards giving\r\nenthusiastic cheers.\r\n\r\nThus was taken the citadel of the Katipunan with a loss to the\r\nSpaniards of 25 killed and 129 wounded.\r\n\r\nThe taking of Imus gave General Polavieja an opportunity of offering\r\nan amnesty to the rebels, which he did not neglect. On the 26th of\r\nMarch he issued a proclamation offering pardon to all who had borne\r\narms against the Royal Authority, or who had assisted the rebels,\r\nprovided they presented themselves before Palm Sunday the 11th of\r\nApril. Leaders of the rebels were to present themselves with their\r\nforces and arms.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th March the division, leaving a garrison in Imus, started\r\nfor Bacoor to take the defences in reverse, and such was the effect on\r\nthe rebels of their defeat at Imus and of the advance in overwhelming\r\nforce, that they fled, and the division occupied Bacoor almost without\r\nfiring a shot.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise with Binacayan, for Marina's Brigade having made a\r\nreconnaissance in force on the 28th, were received with a heavy fire,\r\nand after an hour's skirmish in which some were killed on each side,\r\nthey returned to their camp at Bacoor; Lachambre considering that\r\nan attack in that direction would result in a useless waste of life,\r\nfor the advance would be along narrow causeways across swamps. Having\r\nreceived provisions and ammunition by sea from Manila, he returned\r\nwith his division to Imus, the garrison of which had not been molested\r\nby the rebels.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on the 31st March, the division left Imus and marched\r\nacross country in a westerly and southerly direction, fording numerous\r\nstreams running at the bottom of deep ravines, as well as many\r\nirrigating canals and ditches. Soon after the start the right flank\r\nwas fired upon, the fire increasing as the column moved forward. The\r\nengineers had to improve the approaches to the fords of the Rivers\r\nJulian and Batong Dalig under fire.\r\n\r\nThe leading brigade carried several entrenchments on its front and\r\nflank without halting, but extending skirmishes on either flank to\r\nbeat off the enemy. The rear brigade was attacked on both flanks and\r\nhad to fight a rearguard action as well. The division bivouacked for\r\nthe night at Bacao, a point from which it threatened the rebel towns of\r\nSan Francisco, Santa Cruz, Rosario and Noveleta, all within easy reach.\r\n\r\nThe losses on the day's march were 6 killed and 37 wounded, whilst\r\n400 rebel killed were counted on open ground, and many must have\r\nfallen amongst the bushes and trees.\r\n\r\nThey, however, were not at all dismayed, and surrounded the bivouac\r\nat night, firing repeated volleys and engaging the outposts.\r\n\r\nOn the following day (1st April), the division with all its baggage\r\ncrossed the River Ladron, and took up a position in the centre of a\r\nlarge tract of rice-fields, having Noveleta on the north, San Francisco\r\non the south, Rosario and Santa Cruz to the west, and San Antonio on\r\nthe east. San Antonio was first taken by assault after the parapet\r\nhad been breached by the fire of two batteries of mountain guns. The\r\nfugitive Tagals who escaped with their lives took refuge in Noveleta.\r\n\r\nThe situation was now as follows: Arizon's Brigade threatened Noveleta,\r\nMarina's Brigade threatened Rosario and Sarralde's Brigade attacked\r\nSanta Cruz--the baggage being in the centre and out of fire.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a dense mass of the enemy issuing from San Francisco,\r\nmade a desperate attack upon the Spaniards nearest to them.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the division with its twelve guns, was now in action\r\nand surrounded by the enemy, Lachambre in the centre keenly watching\r\nthe fight. When he judged the right moment had arrived, he ordered\r\nArizon's Brigade to storm Noveleta.\r\n\r\nThe Brigade greeted this order with thundering shouts of \"Viva Espana,\"\r\nand with the pluck that has always distinguished the Spanish soldier\r\nwhen well led, carried the entrenchments at a run, and fought a hand to\r\nhand combat with the defenders, who were either killed or driven out,\r\nnotwithstanding that these were the very best of the rebel troops,\r\namongst them being many of Aguinaldo's Guards, wearing a special\r\nuniform, some of them having served in the native regiments. Here,\r\nagain, the 74th Native Infantry distinguished themselves by their\r\nremarkable bravery, and once more their colour was displayed from\r\nthe church tower as a recognition of their valuable and loyal services.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Noveleta placed the division in communication with\r\nthe marines occupying the entrenchments of Dalahican.\r\n\r\nThis action cost the division 11 killed and 58 wounded, but many\r\nhundreds of the rebels were killed.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, the rebels abandoned Cavite, Viejo, and\r\nBinacayan, which were occupied the following day without resistance.\r\n\r\nThe rebels, however, on the 4th, and again on the 5th, attacked the\r\ntroops in Noveleta and sustained the combat for some time, killing\r\n10 and wounding 33 Spanish, but leaving 50 of their own dead on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th the division marched from Noveleta, which was occupied\r\nby a garrison of marines, and took the direction of San Francisco,\r\nthe advanced guard in extended order across the same open ground upon\r\nwhich the engagement of April 1st was fought. The rebel positions\r\non the right flank were marked by lines of skirmishers with their\r\nsupports and reserves. The Tagals had, however, inundated the part\r\nof this plain immediately in front of the town, and the advance was\r\nmade with great difficulty; the guns and ammunition boxes having to\r\nbe carried by the gunners with the assistance of the infantry. With\r\nundaunted bravery the troops struggled on under a heavy fire, but\r\nLachambre, realising the difficulty and the danger incurred, changed\r\nthe direction of the advance. The right wing under Arizon inclined to\r\nthe right, and the left, under Marina, bore away to the left. Half a\r\nbrigade crossed the River Ladron, notwithstanding the opposition of\r\nthe rebels, and attacked the town from the east. Firmer ground was soon\r\nreached, the guns that had cost so much labour taking up, were mounted,\r\nand a rain of shell soon fell amongst the rebels. The infantry poured\r\nin steady volleys, advancing in the intervals of firing. The whole\r\ncombined attack being within a proper distance for the final rush,\r\nLachambre gave the word, and like greyhounds released, the Spanish\r\nand native infantry leaped to the assault. The parapet was high and\r\ndeep the ditch, for the defenders had not spared their labour on it,\r\nand as the Spanish line reached the edge, the rebels boldly mounted\r\nthe parapet and discharged their arms at close quarters. In this\r\ncritical moment the moral superiority of the white man once more was\r\nmanifest. The Spanish troops reached the parapet and a hand-to-hand\r\ncombat with the bolder rebels took place, the bayonet against the\r\nspear or bolo. The less-determined of the enemy fled, and in a few\r\nminutes 120 Tagals lay dead against the parapet, and five guns and\r\neighty rifles remained as trophies to the victors. The companies\r\nre-formed for the pursuit, but the enemy fired the thatched huts\r\nto interpose a curtain of flame between them and their pursuers; a\r\nmeasure which was only partially successful, for some of the troops,\r\nnimbly darting through the lanes, shot down or bayoneted many of\r\nthe fugitives, killing 400 in the pursuit, besides those who died at\r\nthe entrenchments. The Spanish loss was 25 killed and 125 wounded,\r\nincluding several officers. The fighting had lasted four hours over\r\nvery difficult ground, and the troops were exhausted. Lachambre\r\ntherefore camped in the town, which has many fine edifices and a\r\nspacious, church and convent. The bells of the church, in a joyful\r\npeal, announced the Spanish triumph. The rebels were under the command\r\nof Andres Bonifacio, the President of the formidable Katipunan. This\r\nterrible blow to the insurrection was followed by the occupation of\r\nthe towns of Santa Cruz and Rosario, without firing a shot.\r\n\r\nMany of the natives had joined the rebellion under compulsion, and\r\nhad long desired to submit themselves. Now they came in by hundreds\r\nevery day to claim the amnesty offered by General Polavieja.\r\n\r\nFifty-two days had the campaign lasted, fifty-seven combats had taken\r\nplace, and the total loss of the division was 1 general, 14 officers,\r\nand 168 men killed, and 56 officers and 910 men wounded. Probably a\r\nfar larger number died or were invalided from disease, induced by the\r\nfatigue, exposure and privations inseparable from such a campaign,\r\nespecially as most of the men were mere youths, raw recruits, and\r\nwith little possibility of taking care of themselves, even if they\r\nknew how. Notwithstanding the excessive fatigue and the depressing\r\nnature of the surroundings, the Spanish troops maintained a fine\r\nmartial spirit, and ever showed themselves ready to respond to\r\nthe calls made upon them. They were well led by their officers,\r\nwho devoted themselves unsparingly in their country's service, and\r\nthey had confidence in their generals, who were untiring in their\r\nexertions to do their best for their men. Lachambre displayed the\r\ngreatest solicitude for the well-being of the force under his command;\r\nwhilst showing the utmost resolution, and pushing his attacks home\r\nin every case, yet he sacrificed his men as little as possible, and\r\nalways had patience to wait till his flanking attacks could join in\r\nthe assault. The distances the division had to traverse were very\r\nsmall, but the absence of roads and bridges made the provisioning of\r\nthe army a matter of the utmost difficulty.\r\n\r\nThose who know the poverty of the Spanish Army in animals,\r\nvehicles, and stores, will understand what Lachambre and his staff\r\naccomplished. On the 12th April, 1897, the division was broken up,\r\nand the brigades were stationed at various places in Cavite and the\r\nneighbouring provinces.\r\n\r\nThe general, brigadiers, officers, and troops, are fortunate in having\r\nas chronicler of their exploits, so painstaking and appreciative an\r\nofficer as Lieut.-Colonel Don Federico de Monteverde y Sedano, who in\r\nhis book, 'La Division Lachambre,' published in 1898, gives a detailed\r\naccount of the campaign, with sketches illustrative of the various\r\nactions. Senor Monteverde does justice to every Spaniard, from the\r\ndivisional-general downwards. I could wish he had said something more\r\nabout the services of the 73rd and 74th Regiments of Native Infantry,\r\nwho seem to have been always in the forefront of the battle and where\r\nthe hardest work was being done, as in assisting the magnificent\r\nengineer corps, without whom I doubt if the campaign could have been\r\nsuccessful. His book, however, is invaluable to those who may have\r\nto conduct operations in the Philippines, and the invariable success\r\nachieved by Lachambre, contrasts remarkably with the failures in the\r\nearly part of the rebellion, and one cannot help seeing a parallel\r\nbetween this little war and the greater one in South Africa. Each was\r\nmismanaged at the beginning, but as soon as the invading forces were\r\norganised in one command, success was achieved.\r\n\r\nA few days after the breaking up of the division, General Polavieja\r\nembarked for Spain, very much broken in health. In a letter written\r\non the 9th March to the Minister of War, Polavieja declared himself\r\ntoo ill to ride and asked for his relief. He, however, still remained\r\nat Paranaque, directing the campaign till after the capture of San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish press took sides for or against him, the papers advocating\r\nthe interests of the friars praised him, whilst the Liberal press\r\nheld him up to ridicule.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that he directed the military operations in an\r\nefficient manner, but under his government the arbitrary arrests,\r\ncruelties, and tortures, inflicted upon all who were suspected of being\r\nsympathisers with the rebels, or from whom money would be extorted,\r\nthat had begun under Blanco, continued and increased. For Blanco,\r\nhaving been informed of the cruelties inflicted, issued an order\r\nforbidding the practice.\r\n\r\nThe next governor-general was General Primo de Rivera, who had held\r\nthat office from 1880 to 1883, and had found it a very profitable\r\none. He arrived on the 23rd April and went to the front on the 29th;\r\non the 4th May, Naic was taken, also a small place called Quintana,\r\nand Indang. At Naic there was very heavy fighting, and some at Indang.\r\n\r\nThe troops then advanced to Maragondon, which was taken on the 10th\r\nafter a most stubborn resistance, the Spaniards losing many men and\r\nthe rebels still more heavily.\r\n\r\nThis place was the last where the rebels made a stand, in Cavite\r\nprovince. After this defeat they dispersed in roving bands and kept\r\non the move.\r\n\r\nThe whole province was a scene of desolation, towns burnt, churches\r\nbombarded, stone houses blown up, property looted, putrefying bodies\r\nlying about in hundreds, the fields laid waste, the cattle driven off,\r\nthe country depopulated, a remnant of the inhabitants hiding in the\r\nwoods; a few of the bolder ones returned to the ruined houses. Such\r\nwas the result of this unhappy rebellion.\r\n\r\nI have this description from an eye-witness, and he assured me that he\r\nhad been told by a colonel commanding one of the most distinguished\r\nregiments engaged in the campaign, that not less than 30,000 natives\r\nlost their lives in that province alone during the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe rebels gave no quarter to Spaniards, and the Spaniards only\r\noccasionally took prisoners. However, once taken they were usually\r\nreleased after being exhorted to return to their homes.\r\n\r\nWhilst the operations of Lachambre's division were proceeding in\r\nCavite, General Monet, with a force of 3000 men, was carrying on an\r\nindiscriminate butchery of men, women, and children, in Bulacan and\r\nPampanga, but he displayed no military qualities, and ultimately\r\nescaped, leaving his forces to surrender.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Volunteers in Manila continued their series of abominable\r\noutrages, although in August, Primo de Rivera issued a decree\r\nforbidding intimidation, plundering and ravishing. He was ultimately\r\nobliged to disband them.\r\n\r\nDriven out of Cavite, the remnant of the rebels under Aguinaldo took\r\nrefuge in the hills and held a strong position near Angat, in the\r\nprovince of Bulacan. As it would have taken a long time to reduce them,\r\nPrimo de Rivera tried conciliation, and employed Don Pedro Paterno,\r\na native gentleman of means, who had been educated in Spain, as\r\nmediator. By his instrumentality, an arrangement was arrived at which,\r\nafter being approved by the Government in Madrid, was signed by the\r\nmediator as attorney for the rebels and the governor-general for Spain.\r\n\r\nThis, known as the pact of Biak-na-bato, was signed on December\r\n14th, 1897.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, Aguinaldo and a number of the prominent rebels were\r\nescorted to Hong Kong by a relative of the governor-general, and\r\nthere received a sum of $400,000, being the first instalment of the\r\nsum agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThey lived in a quiet and economical manner upon their own\r\nresources. They did not divide the indemnity nor convert it to their\r\nown use, but kept it as a war fund in case of need.\r\n\r\nThe event showed the wisdom of this course, for Primo de Rivera had\r\nled them to understand that an amnesty and reforms were to follow,\r\nbut, apparently, had caused the Spanish Government to look upon the\r\narrangement in a very different light, and he subsequently denied\r\nthat any treaty existed. No reforms were ever granted, and things\r\nin Luzon went on in the same old way. The friars joined in raising\r\na large subscription for Primo de Rivera, and this seemed to incline\r\nhim more favourably towards them.\r\n\r\nThe amnesty was disregarded, and the priests continued their arbitrary\r\ncourses against those who had been concerned in the rebellion. Bands\r\nof marauders infested the provinces and the country was in a very\r\nunsettled state, some insurgent bands approaching Cavite.\r\n\r\nOn March 24th, the 74th Regiment of Native Infantry in garrison at\r\nthat town, the regiment that had distinguished itself so remarkably in\r\nLachambre's division, being always in the front, was ordered to march\r\nout against them. Whatever the reason, whether they felt that their\r\nsplendid services had not been duly acknowledged, or, as is likely,\r\ntheir pay was months in arrears, they refused to march against their\r\nown countrymen. Eight corporals were called out of the ranks and shot\r\nthen and there in the presence of the regiment, which was again ordered\r\nto advance, and a threat made that a refusal would mean death to all.\r\n\r\nAll did refuse and were sent to barracks to await sentence. The next\r\nmorning the entire regiment with arms and equipment, marched out\r\nand deserted in a body to the insurgents, saying they were willing\r\nto fight the foreign enemies of Spain, but not against their own\r\nfriends. The following day another regiment joined them, but I have\r\nno note of its number.\r\n\r\nIt was now that an event occurred in Manila that showed how little\r\ndesire there was amongst the Spaniards to treat the natives with\r\nordinary justice, much less to conciliate them.\r\n\r\nThis was the massacre of the Calle de Camba, quite a short distance\r\nfrom the American Consulate, and it was perpetrated on the 25th and\r\n26th of March. On the first of those day a number of Visayan sailors\r\nfrom the vessels in the Pasig had assembled in a house in the above\r\nstreet, which was their usual resort.\r\n\r\nSomehow the story got about that an illegal assembly was being held,\r\nand the police, without more ado, attacked the meeting and shot down\r\na dozen, taking sixty-two prisoners. The next morning the whole of\r\nthese prisoners were marched to the cemetery, and all shot, though\r\nmany them were known to have been merely passing by at the time.\r\n\r\nThis is vouched for by Mr. Oscar F. Williams in an official letter\r\nto Mr. Cridler, dated 27th March, 1898. It could hardly have been\r\na mere coincidence that a revolt of the Visayas broke out about ten\r\ndays later, when they made a desperate attack upon the city of Cebu\r\nin which many lives were lost and much property damaged.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly worth while to relate any more instances of Tagal\r\nrevenge or Spanish brutality. The country that had been almost pacified\r\nwas now again in revolt and amongst the insurgents were two battalions\r\nof well-trained and veteran troops.\r\n\r\nBut now events were impending of transcendent importance--the\r\nSpanish-American War had broken out.\r\n\r\nPreviously, however, Primo de Rivera left Manila to return to Spain,\r\nbut before going he granted an amnesty to all who had tortured\r\nsuspected persons to extort evidence from them.\r\n\r\nSome of the victims had died under torture rather than bear witness\r\nagainst their friends, for the Tagal is a Stoic after the manner\r\nof the Red Indian. Others survive, mere wrecks, maimed for life,\r\nand living mementoes of Spanish cruelty.\r\n\r\nTorture for extracting evidence from suspected persons is illegal in\r\nall Christian countries and their dependencies, and also in Japan,\r\nbut has not yet been entirely routed out in British India nor in\r\nEgypt. In 1897, four cases of police torture in the North-West\r\nProvinces and Oudh, ended in convictions.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, some police officers are now on their trial for applying\r\nthe thumb-screw to the fingers of anarchist prisoners in the Castle\r\nof Monjuich with such severity, that one of them, a railway porter,\r\nlost the use of his hands and arms. And Ysabelo de los Reyes, a native\r\nof Ilocos, declares that he was tortured in the same prison by thirst,\r\nhaving been fed upon salt food and deprived of water.\r\n\r\nLast March (1900), a captain of police was tried at Sambor, in\r\nAustrian Galicia, for torturing prisoners with the thumb-screw\r\nand by deprivation of food, and was sentenced to a long term of\r\nimprisonment. In Corea, China, and Siam, torture forms part of the\r\nlegal procedure before sentence, to say nothing of the various\r\nand lingering deaths the judge may order after the prisoner has\r\nconfessed. Let us hope that now there will be no more of it in the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICANS IN THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\n    Manila Bay--The naval battle of Cavite--General\r\n    Aguinaldo--Progress of the Tagals--The Tagal Republic--Who\r\n    were the aggressors?--Requisites for a settlement--Scenes\r\n    of drunkenness--The estates of the religious orders to be\r\n    restored--Slow progress of the campaign--Colonel Funston's\r\n    gallant exploits--Colonel Stotsenburg's heroic death--General\r\n    Antonio Luna's gallant rally of his troops at Macabebe--Reports\r\n    manipulated--Imaginary hills and jungles--Want of co-operation\r\n    between army and navy--Advice of Sir Andrew Clarke--Naval officers\r\n    as administrators--Mr. Whitelaw Reid's denunciations--Senator\r\n    Hoar's opinion--Mr. McKinley's speech at Pittsburgh--The false\r\n    prophets of the Philippines--Tagal opinion of American Rule--Senor\r\n    Mabini's manifesto--Don Macario Adriatico's letter--Foreman's\r\n    prophecy--The administration misled--Racial antipathy--The curse\r\n    of the Redskins--The recall of General Otis--McArthur calls\r\n    for reinforcements--Sixty-five thousand men and forty ships of\r\n    war--State of the islands--Aguinaldo on the Taft Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManila Bay.\r\n\r\nThe width of the entrance to the vast Bay of Manila is nine and a\r\nhalf marine miles from shore to shore. It is divided into two unequal\r\nchannels by the Island of Corregidor and Pulo Caballo, and a rock\r\ncalled El Frayle, about a mile and a half from the southern shore,\r\nfarther reduces that channel.\r\n\r\nThe Boca Chica, or northern entrance between Corregidor Island and\r\nPunta Lasisi, is two marine miles wide, and in the middle of the\r\nchannel the depth of water is about thirty fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe Boca Grande, or southern entrance between Pulo Caballo and El\r\nFrayle, is three and a half marine miles wide, with a depth of water\r\nin the fairway of about twenty fathoms.\r\n\r\nIn both channels the tide rushes in and out with great force.\r\n\r\nWith channels of such a width there was no difficulty in taking a\r\nsquadron in at night, and little chance of suffering damage from the\r\nhastily improvised batteries of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAnd it will be evident to all having the slightest knowledge of\r\nsubmarine mining that the conditions are most unfavourable to defence\r\nby such means. As a matter of fact, the Spaniards possessed only\r\nnine obsolete submarine mines fitted to explode by contact. These\r\nwere sent over to Corregidor, but were not sunk, as it was obvious\r\nthat they were useless.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was a perfect position for the employment of\r\ntorpedo boats or gunboats, there being excellent anchorage for such\r\ncraft on both sides of the Channel and in Corregidor Cove. But at the\r\ntime of the declaration of war, the Spaniards had no torpedo boats\r\nin the Philippines. The Elswick-built cruisers Isla de Cuba and Isla\r\nde Luzon were fitted with torpedoes, and might have been watching the\r\nchannels for a chance to use them. Admiral Montojo knows best why he\r\ndid not detach them on this service.\r\n\r\nThere was then nothing to prevent the entrance of the American\r\nSquadron; the mines, torpedo boats and narrow channels only existed\r\nin the imagination of some American newspaper correspondents.\r\n\r\nBut Admiral Dewey's exploit does not need any such enhancing, it\r\nspeaks for itself.\r\n\r\nTo any one having a knowledge of the Spanish navy, and especially\r\nof the squadron of the Philippines, the result of an action against\r\nan American Squadron of similar force could not be doubtful. As a\r\nmatter of fact the Spanish ships, except the two small cruisers\r\nbuilt at Elswick in 1887, were quite obsolete. The Castilla and\r\nReina Cristina were wooden vessels, standing very high out of the\r\nwater, and making admirable targets, whilst their guns were small,\r\nsome of them had been landed at Corregidor, though never placed in\r\nbattery. The boilers of one vessel were in the arsenal.\r\n\r\nBut even allowing for the fact that the tonnage of the American\r\nSquadron was half as much again as that of the Spaniards, and that\r\nthey had more than twice as many, and heavier guns, no one would\r\nhave supposed it possible that the Spanish Squadron could have been\r\ncompletely destroyed without inflicting any damage upon the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a brilliant victory, reflecting great credit upon\r\nAdmiral Dewey and the officers and crews of the American ships, not\r\nonly for what they did that day, but for their careful preparation\r\nthat enabled them to score so decided a success.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish sailors put up a good fight and showed pluck, but they\r\nhad no skill as gunners, and so failed in the hour of their country's\r\nneed. Admiral Montojo bravely commanded his fleet, but as soon as\r\nthe action was over he seems to have considered that his duty had\r\nterminated, for he returned to his Villa in San Miguel, leaving the\r\nremnants of his squadron and the Cavite arsenal to its fate.\r\n\r\nWe must infer that Admiral Dewey's victory and its consequences\r\nwere not foreseen by the American Government, for they had made no\r\npreparations to send troops to Manila, and from the time they learned\r\nof the destruction of the Spanish Squadron, till they had assembled\r\na force strong enough to take and hold the city, three weary months\r\nelapsed. This was a very hap-hazard way of making war, and the delay\r\ncost many thousands of lives as will be seen later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th May, 1898, Don Emilio Aguinaldo, former chief of the\r\ninsurgents, arrived in Manila in pursuance of an arrangement with\r\nthe American Consul-General at Singapore. He came with a suite of\r\nseventeen persons on board an American gunboat, and after an interview\r\nwith Admiral Dewey, was landed at Cavite and given two field-pieces,\r\na number of rifles and a supply of ammunition.\r\n\r\nHe soon reasserted himself as the leader of the insurrection, which was\r\nalready in active progress, and gained some signal successes against\r\nthe Spaniards. On the 24th May he issued a proclamation enjoining his\r\nfollowers to make war in a civilized manner and to respect property.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to discuss the negotiations between Mr. Pratt and\r\nAguinaldo, nor between the latter and Admiral Dewey. This subject\r\nhas been very fully treated by Mr. Foreman in the second edition of\r\nhis book. The treating with Aguinaldo was not approved by Mr. Day at\r\nWashington, and the Consul-General and Consuls who had participated\r\nin it, and even taken credit for it, were severely rapped over the\r\nknuckles and promptly adopted an apologetic tone (see Blue Book). But\r\nwhatever was the agreement with Aguinaldo, it is evident that had it\r\nnot been for his assistance and that of the insurgents, the Spanish\r\nforces could have retired from Manila to Tarlac or other place inland\r\nout of reach of the guns of the fleet and could have prolonged their\r\nresistance for years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tagal Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Tagals had made much progress since the insurrection of\r\n1896-7. Their ideas had advanced considerably since their rudimentary\r\norganization in the Province of Cavite, as can be gathered from the\r\nimproved style of the various proclamations and decrees published\r\nby Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\nThey now organized a Government, a real Civil Administration, extending\r\nover a great part of Luzon, and sent an expedition to Visayas. They\r\nestablished a Constitution, a representative government, and reopened\r\nthe courts and schools, whilst the native clergy carried on public\r\nworship as usual. Aguinaldo repeatedly asserted the determination\r\nof the Tagal people to fight to the death for independence. At this\r\ntime the insurgents held 9000 Spaniards as prisoners of war, and they\r\nclaimed to have 30,000 men under arms.\r\n\r\nPaymaster Wilcox, U.S.N., and Mr. Leonard R. Sargent who travelled\r\nthrough part of Luzon for more than 600 miles, and during six weeks,\r\nreported [9] to Admiral Dewey that a regular and orderly Administration\r\nhad been established, and was in full working order.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo was at the head of this Government and of the army\r\nco-operating with the American forces by the written request of General\r\nAnderson. This should have ensured him and those with him at the very\r\nleast courteous and considerate treatment at the hands of the American\r\nCommanders, and in fact he received this from Admiral Dewey. But as\r\nsoon as the direction of affairs passed into the hands of the general\r\ncommanding the army the deeply-rooted contempt felt by Americans for\r\nthe coloured races was allowed full play, Aguinaldo and his staff\r\nfound themselves ignored, or treated with scarcely veiled contempt,\r\nand the estrangement was gradually increased.\r\n\r\nI do not know which party was the aggressor on February the 4th, 1899,\r\neach swears that it was the other. The cui bono test cuts both ways,\r\nfor whilst it appears that the attack on Manila secured two doubtful\r\nvotes in the Senate for the ratification of the Treaty whereby the\r\nPhilippines were bought from Spain, on the other hand, Aguinaldo may\r\nhave felt it necessary to prove to America that the Philippines would\r\nfight rather than bow their necks to the Yankee yoke. So that both\r\nparties may have had an interest in beginning hostilities. In any case,\r\nthe next day Aguinaldo offered to withdraw to a greater distance if an\r\narmistice was arranged, but Otis declared that \"fighting must go on.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think that if a sympathetic and conciliatory attitude had\r\nbeen adopted, had the local government established been recognized,\r\nhad Aguinaldo and his staff been given commissions in the Native\r\nArmy or Civil Service, and the flower of the Tagal Army taken into\r\nthe service of the United States, a peaceful settlement could have\r\nbeen made on the lines of a Protectorate.\r\n\r\nI therefore look upon the war as unnecessary, and consider the lives\r\nalready sacrificed, and that will have to be sacrificed, as absolutely\r\nthrown away.\r\n\r\nThe tragical side of American unpreparedness is manifest in the state\r\nof anarchy in which the whole Archipelago has been plunged by the\r\nAmerican unreadiness to occupy the military posts as soon as they were\r\nvacated by the Spanish garrisons. A hideous orgy of murder, plunder,\r\nand slave-raiding has prevailed in Visayas, and especially in Mindanao.\r\n\r\nThree conditions were essential to a peaceful settlement:--\r\n\r\nFirst.--A broad-minded and sympathetic representative of America,\r\nfully authorized to treat, and a lover of peace.\r\n\r\nSecond.--A strict discipline amongst the American forces.\r\n\r\nThird.--The principal aim and object of the Tagal insurrection must\r\nbe secured.\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis does not seem to me to fulfil the first condition,\r\nhe lacked prestige and patience, and he showed that he had an\r\ninsufficient conception of the magnitude of his task by occupying\r\nhimself with petty details of all kinds and by displaying an ill-timed\r\nparsimony. Apparently he had no power to grant anything at all,\r\nand only dealt in vague generalities which the Tagals could not be\r\nexpected to accept.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second point, I regret that I am not personally\r\nacquainted with the gentlemen from Nebraska, Colorado, Dakota and\r\nother states serving in the United States Army or volunteers. I have\r\nno doubt that they are good fighting-men, but from all I can hear\r\nabout them they are not conspicuous for strict military discipline,\r\nand too many of them have erroneous ideas as to the most suitable\r\ndrink for a tropical climate.\r\n\r\nManila was in the time of the Spaniards a most temperate city; a\r\ndrunken man was a very rare sight, and would usually be a foreign\r\nsailor. Since the American occupation, some hundreds of drinking\r\nsaloons have been opened, and daily scenes of drunkenness and\r\ndebauchery have filled the quiet natives with alarm and horror. When\r\nJohn L. Motley wrote his scathing denunciation of the army which the\r\ngreat Duke of Alva led from Spain into the Low Countries, \"to enforce\r\nthe high religious purposes of Philip II.,\" not foresee that his\r\nwords would be applicable to an American Army sent to subjugate men\r\nstruggling to be free \"for their welfare, not our gain,\" nor that this\r\narmy, besides bringing in its train a flood of cosmopolitan harlotry,\r\n[10] would be allowed by its commander to inaugurate amongst a strictly\r\ntemperate people a mad saturnalia of drunkenness that has scarcely\r\na parallel.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, is undoubtedly the case, and I venture to think that\r\nthese occurrences have confirmed many of the Tagals in their resolve\r\nrather to die fighting for their independence than to be ruled over\r\nby such as these.\r\n\r\nMore important still was it to take care that the Tagal insurrection\r\nshould not have been in vain. That rebellion probably cost fifty\r\nthousand human lives, immense loss of property, and untold misery. It\r\nwas fought against the friars and was at last triumphant. The\r\nSpanish friars had been expelled and their lands confiscated. Were\r\nthe Americans to bring them back and guarantee them in peaceable\r\npossession, once more riveting on the chain the Tagals had torn off?\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been General Otis' intention. I think he might\r\nhave stood upon the accomplished fact. But he did not.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Peace under Article VIII. declares that the cession\r\ncannot in any respect impair the rights of ecclesiastical bodies\r\nto acquire and possess property, whilst Article IX. allows Spanish\r\nsubjects to remain in the Islands, to sell or dispose of their property\r\nand to carry on their professions. Presumably General Otis felt bound\r\nby the Treaty in which these general stipulations had been embodied\r\nby the Peace Commission, in direct contradiction to the advice\r\ngiven them by Mr. Foreman (see p. 463, 55th Congress, 3rd Sess.,\r\nDoc. No. 62, part 1), who pointed out the necessity of confiscating\r\nthese lands, but Mr. Gray replied: \"We have no law which will allow\r\nus to arbitrarily do so.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the effect of the treaty was known, Archbishop Nozaleda,\r\nwho had fled to China from the vengeance he feared, returned to\r\nManila. He seemed to have a good deal of interest with General Otis,\r\nand this did not please the natives, nor inspire them with confidence.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was reported and generally believed that the friars'\r\nvast estates had been purchased by an American Syndicate who would\r\nin due time take possession and exploit them.\r\n\r\nOne can understand the Tagals' grief and desperation; all their blood\r\nand tears shed in vain! The friars triumphant after all!\r\n\r\nI do not wish to trace the particulars of the wretched war that\r\ncommenced February, 1899, and is still (October, 1900) proceeding.\r\n\r\nIn it the Americans do not seem to have displayed the resourcefulness\r\nand adaptability one would have expected from them. For my part, I\r\nexpected a great deal, for so many American generals being selected\r\nfrom men in the active exercise of a profession, or perhaps controlling\r\nthe administration of some vast business, they ought naturally to\r\nhave developed their faculties, by constant use, to a far greater\r\ndegree than men who have vegetated in the futile routine of a barrack\r\nor military station. They prevailed in every encounter, but their\r\nadvance was very slow, and their troops suffered many preventible\r\nhardships. We know very little as to what happened, for the censors,\r\nacting under instructions from General Otis, prevented the transmission\r\nof accurate information; nothing was cabled, except the accounts of\r\nvictories gained by the American troops.\r\n\r\nIt would not be right, however, to pass over the fighting without\r\nrendering due tribute to the heroism of the American officers and\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nWho can forget Colonel Funston's gallant exploit in crossing the Rio\r\nGrande on a raft under fire with two companies of Kansas Infantry\r\nand enfilading the Tagals' position? Or his leading part of same\r\nregiment in a charge upon an enemy's earthwork near Santo Tomas,\r\nwhere he was wounded?\r\n\r\nWhat could be finer than the late Colonel Stotsenburg's leading of the\r\nNebraska regiment in the attack on Quingua, where he was killed? And\r\nsince we are speaking of brave men, shall we not remember the late\r\nGeneral Antonio Luna and his gallant rally of his army in the advance\r\nfrom Macabebe, when he fearlessly exposed himself on horseback to\r\nthe American fire, riding along the front of his line? To justify\r\nthe slow progress of the army, jungles, forests, swamps and hills\r\nwere introduced on the perfectly flat arable land such as that around\r\nMalolos, Calumpit, and San Fernando, extending in fact all the way from\r\nManila to Tarlac. [11] This country supports a dense population, and\r\nalmost every bit of it has been under the plough for centuries. The\r\nonly hill is Arayat. During the dry season, say from November to\r\nMay or June, the soil is baked quite hard, and vehicles or guns can\r\ntraverse any part of it with slight assistance from the pioneers. The\r\nonly obstacles are the small rivers and creeks, mostly fordable, and\r\nhaving clumps of bamboos growing on their banks providing a perfect\r\nmaterial for temporary bridges or for making rafts.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was marked by an absence of co-operation between the land\r\nand sea forces. Admiral Dewey, apparently, was not pleased with the\r\nway things were managed, for he is said to have stayed on board his\r\nship for months at a time. The warships remained at anchor in Manila\r\nBay whilst arms [12] and ammunition were landed at the outposts or\r\non the coasts without hindrance, and it was not till November that\r\ntroops were landed at Dagupan, the northern terminus of the railway,\r\nthough this obviously ought to have been done in February, so as to\r\nattack the enemy front and rear.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for small gunboats soon made itself felt, but such\r\nwas the jealousy of the army towards the navy that it was decided\r\nthat these must be army gunboats, and General Otis is reported to\r\nhave purchased thirteen small gunboats at Zamboanga, in March 1899,\r\nwithout consulting or informing Admiral Dewey or even asking for an\r\nescort for them. It so happened that the Spaniards evacuated Zamboanga\r\nbefore any American forces arrived, and the insurgents promptly took\r\npossession of the gunboats already paid for and proceeded to plunder\r\nthem of everything useful to them. A native account says that they\r\ntook the gunboats up the Rio Grande into the interior, but this is\r\ndenied by the Americans. Ultimately a cruiser was sent down to convoy\r\nthe gunboats, and if I am correctly informed, they were commissioned\r\nin charge of junior naval officers.\r\n\r\nObviously, the services of the navy should have been utilised to the\r\nutmost extent, and advantage should have been taken of the prestige\r\nthey had gained by the victory over the Spaniards, and of the great\r\npopularity and sympathetic personality of Admiral Dewey. A serious\r\nresponsibility rests upon whoever allowed jealousy to prevent the\r\nco-operation of the land and sea forces, since by failing to secure\r\nthis they needlessly sacrificed the lives of American soldiers and\r\nprolonged the war.\r\n\r\nLieut.-General Sir Andrew Clarke, R.E., a former governor of the\r\nStraits Settlements, and the greatest authority in England on the\r\naffairs of the Malay States and Islands, was good enough to write a\r\nletter which was forwarded to Mr. Day, and published in the Blue Book,\r\np. 628.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that, although a moderate military force might be\r\ndesirable at one or two important centres, a naval force was of more\r\nvalue, especially gunboats able to move freely amongst the islands\r\nand ascend the many rivers and inlets of the sea.\r\n\r\nTherefore to the fleet and its officers he advised that political\r\nand civil administration of the Philippines should, at least in the\r\nfirst instance, be entrusted. Sir Andrew believed, and I venture to\r\nsay that I thoroughly agree with him, that amongst the officers of\r\nthe United States navy, active and retired, can be found many men of\r\nwide experience, broad views, and generous sympathy well fitted to\r\nadminister the affairs of the protectorate. Sir Andrew also advised,\r\nas Foreman did, and as I do, that the members of the Religious\r\nOrders, i.e., the Augustinians, the Dominicans, the Franciscans,\r\nand the Recollets, should be advised to return to Spain, receiving\r\ncompensation for their property.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Clarke summed up his advice as follows: \"Enlist native\r\nsympathy by fairness and justice, and rule through native agents,\r\nsupervised by carefully selected American residents.\"\r\n\r\nAs the fleet, by destroying the Spanish squadron, had rendered it\r\npossible to bring troops by sea, and by capturing the arsenal and\r\nblockading the Port of Manila, had invigorated the insurrection,\r\nand in fact had brought about the cession of the islands by Spain,\r\nit would appear to outsiders that it and its officers had a strong\r\nclaim to the leading part in completing the settlement and pacification\r\nof the Archipelago for which the best authorities considered them to\r\npossess special qualifications. Besides, if peace was really wanted,\r\nit would have been better to entrust the negotiations to the man\r\nwho had had his fight rather than to one looking for his chance. The\r\ncraze for military renown is nowhere more rampant than in the United\r\nStates. Occasions are few and far between, and we must not expect\r\ngenerals to throw them away and fly in the face of Providence.\r\n\r\nThis, however, did not commend itself to those who pull the strings;\r\nwe ignore the reasons, but we see the result. Perhaps it was thought\r\nthat to allow Dewey to add to his victor's laurel wreath the palm of\r\nthe pacificator would be too much honour for one man, and might raise\r\nhim to an inconvenient height in the estimation of his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nA year and twenty days after his decisive victory Admiral Dewey sailed\r\nfrom Manila in his flagship. Wherever the British ensign flew he was\r\nreceived with every demonstration of honour and respect both by naval\r\nand military officers and by civilians. His reception in New York was\r\nmarked by an almost delirious enthusiasm. But long before he arrived,\r\nMr. Whitelaw Reid, disgusted with the conduct of the campaign, made\r\na speech at the Miami University and denounced the President for\r\nneglect of duty which brought on the war in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"If the bitterest enemy of the United States had sought to\r\nbring upon it in that quarter the greatest trouble in the shortest\r\ntime, he could have devised for that end no policy more successful than\r\nthe one we have already pursued.\" It must be added that Mr. Whitelaw\r\nReid, perhaps to prevent being accused of having sympathy with the\r\nenemy, denounced Aguinaldo and the Tagals as rebels, savages and\r\ntreacherous barbarians, unfit for citizenship or self-government, and\r\ndeclared that the Philippines belong to America by right of conquest.\r\n\r\nI suppose Mr. Whitelaw Reid, or perhaps any citizen of the United\r\nStates, has a right to denounce his own President, and certainly\r\nthe management of the Philippine annexation has been bad from the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nBut I think Mr. McKinley was badly served by the Peace Commission. They\r\nseem to me to have made many and egregious mistakes.\r\n\r\n1. They took General Merritt's opinion that the Tagals would submit,\r\nand accepted Mr. Foreman's assurance of Tagal plasticity and\r\naccommodating nature.\r\n\r\n2. They disregarded the intimation of D. Felipe Agoncillo, the\r\naccredited agent of the Tagals, that these would accept no settlement\r\nto which they were not parties.\r\n\r\n3. They treated several millions of civilised Christian people like\r\na herd of cattle to be purchased with the ranch.\r\n\r\n4. Under Article VIII., they guaranteed the religious orders the\r\npossession of estates already taken from them.\r\n\r\n5. Under Article IX., they gave the expelled friars the right to\r\nreturn and exercise their profession.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate their careless procedure, I may add that they did not\r\neven accurately determine the boundaries of the Archipelago to be\r\nceded, and now, in August 1900, $100,000 is to be paid to Spain for\r\nSibutu and Cagayan Sulu Islands, left out by mistake. If any man has a\r\nright to say, \"Save me from my friends,\" that man is William McKinley.\r\n\r\nAs regards Aguinaldo and the Tagals, I think that Mr. Whitelaw Reid's\r\nirritation at their protracted resistance has led him on too far. I\r\nprefer the opinion of Senator Hoar, who, speaking in the Senate of\r\nthree proclamations of Aguinaldo, said: \"Mr. President, these are\r\nthree of the greatest state papers in all history. If they were found\r\nin our own history of our own revolutionary time we should be proud\r\nto have them stand by the side of those great state papers which\r\nChatham declared were equal to the masterpieces of antiquity.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same speech he says, and I commend his words to the reader's\r\nattention: \"Mr. President, there is one mode by which the people of\r\nthe Philippine Islands could establish the truth of the charges as\r\nto their degradation and incapacity for self-government which have\r\nbeen made by the advocates of Imperialism in this debate, and that\r\nmode is by submitting tamely and without resistance to the dominion\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whitelaw Reid, however, was perfectly right in one thing. The\r\nPhilippines belong (or will belong) to America by right of conquest. On\r\nAugust 28th, 1899, Mr. McKinley addressed the 10th Pennsylvania\r\nRegiment at Pittsburgh soon after their arrival from Manila. He\r\nsaid: \"The insurgents struck the first blow. They reciprocated\r\nour kindness with cruelty, our mercy [13] with Mausers.... They\r\nassailed our sovereignty, and there will be no useless parley until\r\nthe insurrection is suppressed and American authority acknowledged\r\nand established. The Philippines are ours as much as Louisiana, by\r\npurchase, or Texas, or Alaska.\" Here we get down to the bed rock,\r\nand discard all flimsy pretences. The Americans have undertaken a war\r\nof conquest, they bought it in fact, but I fear they are not happy\r\neither about its material progress or its moral aspect. We shall have\r\nto wait till November to see what they think about it.\r\n\r\nBut whenever the cost in lost lives, ruined health, and shattered\r\nminds, to say nothing of dollars, comes to be known, there will be\r\na great outcry in America.\r\n\r\nMr. McKinley and his advisers are much to be pitied, for they were\r\nmisled by the information given them by those they relied on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe False Prophets of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from General Merritt's evidence taken from the\r\nBlue Book, fifty-sixth congress, third session, document No. 62,\r\npart I, p. 367:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Reid: Do you think any danger of conflict is now reasonably\r\n    remote?\r\n\r\n    General Merritt: I think there is no danger of conflict as long as\r\n    these people think the United States is going to take possession\r\n    there. If they imagine or hear from any source that the Spaniards\r\n    are to be reinstated there, I think they will be very violent.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Davis: Suppose the United States, by virtue of a treaty with\r\n    Spain, should take Luzon ... paying no attention to the insurgents\r\n    --how would that be taken by Aguinaldo?\r\n\r\n    General Merritt: I think Aguinaldo and his immediate following\r\n    would resist it; but whether he could resist to any extent I do not\r\n    know, because his forces are divided. I believe that, as matters\r\n    go, Aguinaldo will lose more or less of his power there.\r\n\r\n    The Chairman: If the United States should say, We will take this\r\n    country and govern it our own way, do you think they would submit\r\n    to it?\r\n\r\n    General Merritt: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Davis: How many troops in your opinion will be necessary to\r\n    administer the government of this island--to secure the\r\n    administration of our government there?\r\n\r\n    General Merritt: From 20,000 to 25,000 would be requisite at first.\r\n\r\n\r\nI admire the conviction of this distinguished officer that the benefits\r\nof American rule would be highly appreciated by the Tagals, of whom,\r\nby-the-bye, he knew next to nothing, having only been a few weeks in\r\nManila amongst sycophantic Mestizo-Americanistas.\r\n\r\nThat interesting people were, however, of a different opinion. On\r\np. 4582 of the 'Congressional Record,' I find that Senor Mabini, in\r\na manifesto published at San Isidro, April 15th, 1899, states that\r\n\"race hatred is much more cruel and pitiless among the Anglo-Saxons\"\r\n(he is comparing them with the Spaniards). Again he says, \"Annexation,\r\nin whatever form it may be adopted, will unite us for ever to a nation\r\nwhose manners and customs are different from our own, a nation which\r\nhates the coloured race with a mortal hatred, and from which we could\r\nnever separate ourselves except by war.\" The outbreaks against the\r\nnegroes that have recently happened [August, 1900] in New Orleans,\r\nLiberty City, Georgia, and in New York, seem to justify Senor Mabini's\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nDon Macario Adriatico, in an answer to a message of General Miller,\r\nwriting from Jaro, January 3rd, 1900, says: \"It could easily be\r\nconceived that the Philippines would not suffer a new reign, least of\r\nall of a nation on whose conscience the curse of the Redskins rests\r\nas a heavy load.\"\r\n\r\nIn other documents they refer to the probable action of the Trusts,\r\nand anticipate that, what with the Sugar Trust, the Tobacco Trust,\r\nand the Hemp Trust, they would soon find themselves reduced to the\r\ncondition of porters and workmen, or even of domestic servants.\r\n\r\nThey seem to have an intelligent anticipation of what will probably\r\nbefall them when conquered, and hence their desperate resistance to\r\na large American army.\r\n\r\nBut let us now turn up the evidence of another expert on the\r\nPhilippines, Mr. John Foreman, who also ventured to prophesy what\r\nthe Tagals would do (Blue Book, before mentioned, p. 443).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Foreman (answering Mr. Day): \"The Tagals are of a very\r\n    plastic nature, willing in their nature (sic), I should say, to\r\n    accommodate themselves and take up any new established dominion\r\n    which might be decided upon, and I think they would fall into\r\n    any new system adopted.\r\n\r\n    \"The inhabitants of the Central Islands or Visayas are more\r\n    uncouth, decidedly less hospitable, and somewhat more averse\r\n    to associations and relations with outsiders than the Tagals,\r\n    but I think they would easily come under sway. They want a little\r\n    more pressure and would have to be guided, more closely watched,\r\n    and perhaps a little more of the iron hand used than in Luzon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus was the administration in Washington misled, and it is probable\r\nthat the American military chiefs reported that they could easily\r\novercome all opposition, so they were allowed to try.\r\n\r\nYet in June, 1900, we read, \"The recall of General Otis is taken\r\nto mean that the administration considers the war to be at an end,\r\nand that there is no longer any necessity for military rule.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral McArthur is appointed to the command, however, and the first\r\nthing he does is to cable to Washington for more troops, whilst Admiral\r\nRemey asks for an extra battalion of marines. These are to be sent,\r\nalso at least three regiments of infantry. Sixty-five thousand men\r\nand forty ships of war are now admitted to be the proper garrison to\r\nhold down the Philippines.\r\n\r\nHowever necessary reinforcements may be, so deep is the racial\r\nantipathy between the United States' soldiers, white or black,\r\nand the natives, that every additional man sent out is a source of\r\ndisaffection, and even exasperation. Not only will the volunteers\r\nbecome demoralised and diseased in mind and body by their sojourn in\r\nAmerica's new possession, but the very fact of their presence renders\r\nthe pacification of the country more difficult. The more troops are\r\nkept there, the more discontented the natives will be.\r\n\r\nTo bring this chapter up to date, the position seems to be as follows:\r\nThere is a recrudescence of activity amongst the insurgents; fighting\r\nis going on over a great part of the Archipelago, the American troops\r\nare harassed and overworked, sickness is rife, including the bubonic\r\nplague; yet, notwithstanding all this, the Taft Commission has taken\r\nover the administration of the islands from September 1st.\r\n\r\nThe date fixed is not a convenient one for the Commission, as it is\r\nin the middle of the rainy season, but it has probably been selected\r\nto suit the presidential campaign in America.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo has issued a proclamation warning the Filipinos against the\r\nTaft Commission, which, he says, has no authority from Congress; does\r\nnot represent the sentiments of the American people, and is simply the\r\npersonal instrument of Mr. McKinley sent out to make promises which\r\nit has no power to keep, and which the United States Government will\r\nnot be bound to observe. He denounces the Americanistas, and threatens\r\ncondign punishment to all who accept offices under the Commission. It\r\nwould appear that a settlement on present lines is still some way off.\r\n\r\nJudge Taft seems to have inherited the cheerful optimism of General\r\nOtis. On September 1st he reported that the insurrection is virtually\r\nended, and on 20th forwarded another favourable report. On 21st,\r\nGeneral McArthur cabled accounts of engagements in several provinces\r\nof Luzon. The American troops at Pekin are being hurried to Manila,\r\nas the reinforcement of General McArthur is absolutely imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nNATIVE ADMIRATION FOR AMERICA.\r\n\r\n    Their fears of a corrupt government--The islands might be an\r\n    earthly paradise--Wanted, the man--Rajah Brooke--Sir Andrew\r\n    Clarke--Hugh Clifford--John Nicholson--Charles Gordon--Evelyn\r\n    Baring--Mistakes of the Peace Commission--Government should be a\r\n    protectorate--Fighting men should be made governors--What might\r\n    have been--The Malay race--Senator Hoar's speech--Four years'\r\n    slaughter of the Tagals.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a few of the natives in arms were, and still are, sincere admirers\r\nof the true greatness of the United States. The noble deeds and words\r\nof America's great men attain the summit of human grandeur in their\r\nfervid imaginations.\r\n\r\nThe statesmen and the historians of the great Republic receive their\r\ntribute of praise from Filipino lips.\r\n\r\nThe names of Washington, Lincoln, Prescott, Motley, are known and\r\nhonoured by them. Were the natives treated according to the immortal\r\nprinciples of right and justice laid down or praised by such as\r\nthese, they would welcome the tutelage, and, in fact, all Asia might\r\nenvy them.\r\n\r\nBut they will never consent to become the prey of the politician,\r\nthe boss, the monopolist, and the carpet-bagger, and from these they\r\nmust be assured of protection before they will submit.\r\n\r\nWhat confidence can they have in a form of government under which\r\nthe tariffs on their great staples will be made in the interests of\r\ntheir American competitors.\r\n\r\nUnder such a system, and with a pension list steadily growing by\r\nmillions of dollars year by year, their comfortable competence would,\r\nin a few years, be reduced to the hideous poverty of over-taxed\r\nBritish India.\r\n\r\nHaving passed so many years amongst this people, I may be expected\r\nto give some opinion as to whether the Philippines can be governed\r\nby America.\r\n\r\nThe islands were badly governed by Spain, yet Spaniards and natives\r\nlived together in great harmony, and I do not know where I could\r\nfind a colony in which the Europeans mixed as much socially with\r\nthe natives. Not in Java, where a native of position must dismount\r\nto salute the humblest Dutchman. Not in British India, where the\r\nEnglishwoman has now made the gulf between British and native into\r\na bottomless pit.\r\n\r\nIt will be difficult for the Americans to avoid this social ostracism\r\nof the natives, and in this respect they are not likely to do as well\r\nas the Spaniards, being less tolerant.\r\n\r\nAs regards the administration of the government, no doubt great\r\nimprovements can be made; but I abstain from prophecy, remembering\r\nMerritt's and Foreman's want of success in that line. There is\r\ncertainly a wonderful opportunity to show the world how to govern a\r\ntropical protectorate or dependency.\r\n\r\nSo rich a country with so intelligent and industrious a population\r\nonly requires good guidance to make it an earthly paradise. But\r\nthe guidance should be given by the gentle hand of an elder sister,\r\nand not by the boot of a frontier ruffian.\r\n\r\nMuch as our officials praise the administration of the Indian\r\nEmpire, I think it quite possible with a few years of disinterested\r\ntutelage to weld the Philippines into a nation, more united, freer,\r\nhappier, richer and better educated, than the finest state in that\r\nvast possession. What is wanted is The Man, no stubborn and tactless\r\ngeneral \"spoiling for a fight,\" harsh, peremptory, overbearing, but\r\na civilian of the highest rank, or a naval officer, one of America's\r\nvery best, full of sympathy, tact and patience, yet firm as Stonewall\r\nJackson. He must have a gracious presence, and \"magnetism\" in the\r\nhighest degree, for he must rule by personal influence, by inspiring\r\nconfidence and affection.\r\n\r\nNot otherwise did Rajah Brooke obtain his election to the sovereignty\r\nof Sarawak; Sir Andrew Clarke pacify the Malay Peninsula; nor is it\r\notherwise that Hugh Clifford is leading the Malays of North Borneo\r\nto peaceful pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe man, when found, must be invested with absolute power, and be\r\nbacked up by all the forces of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe British Government gave America an example of what to avoid\r\nwhen it sacrificed Governor Eyre, of Jamaica, to a shrieking gang\r\nof pseudo-philanthropists, when, in a great emergency, whilst the\r\nhonour of white women and the lives of men were at the mercy of a mob\r\nof negroes, he omitted some legal technicality before hanging one of\r\nthe cowardly instigators.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not think America will go back on her sons like that.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain has produced some men who could have taken up the\r\nburden of the Philippines. It happens that the three I shall cite\r\nwere all soldiers, but their extraordinary magnetic qualities by no\r\nmeans proceeded from their profession.\r\n\r\nThe God-like man who died at Delhi, the beloved of John Lawrence,\r\nwould have made an ideal ruler: the people would have worshipped him.\r\n\r\nThe hero who died at Khartoum could have ruled the Philippines,\r\nor any Asiatic or African country, and the people would have loved him.\r\n\r\nTo quote one who is still with us, Lord Cromer has coped with\r\ndifficulties of a different kind, yet, perhaps, as great as those of\r\nthe Philippines, and in a few years has changed the face of the land of\r\nPharaoh, and lightened the lot of millions. This has been done by the\r\nassistance of a few engineers, administrators, judges and soldiers. He\r\nand all of them have displayed the most unfailing tact and patience,\r\nindomitable courage and fortitude, and each has put honour and duty\r\nbefore all. Men like John Nicholson, Charles Gordon and Evelyn Baring,\r\nare rare, but their peers doubtless exist amongst Americans of the good\r\nold colonial stock, and it is the President's business to find them,\r\nand send them out to protect and govern America's great dependency.\r\n\r\nAmerica has, I suppose, taken these islands from Spain to save them\r\nfrom the ruthless [14] Teuton, and to show the world that she can\r\ndo for the Philippines what we have done for Egypt. Unfortunately,\r\nshe began wrong by treating with Spain, and buying the islands,\r\nas if the natives were cattle on a ranch.\r\n\r\nThen the Peace Committee went wrong over the estates of the Religious\r\nOrders, as before explained.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the form of government should be a protectorate,\r\nvarying in character with the civilisation of the different islands,\r\nthe executive functions being in the hands of the natives whenever\r\npossible, but under inspection to prevent abuses. On this basis peace\r\ncould, I think, be made, and then America should remember that the\r\nmost worthy of the natives are precisely those who have been in arms\r\nfor their freedom. Their chiefs (with one or two exceptions), are the\r\nmen who should be appointed to govern provinces, and the fighting-men\r\nenrolled in the native army.\r\n\r\nNo offices of government should be given to the so-called\r\nAmericanistas, who are mostly people who need not be taken into\r\naccount, and whose support is worth nothing. They will go on with\r\ntheir pettifogging and their pawnbroking, and that is enough reward\r\nfor them. They are Americanistas because they cannot help themselves,\r\nand not from any attachment to American ways. Formerly the Spaniards\r\nprotected them; now the American bayonets stand between them and the\r\nTagal bolos.\r\n\r\nWithout this, well they know that what happened to the mulattos in\r\nHayti would surely happen to them sooner or later--perhaps sooner.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, sad to see what is, and to think what might have been\r\naccomplished by a little patience, a little forbearance, a tinge of\r\nsympathy, for a gallant people struggling for freedom and light. But\r\nno patience was vouchsafed to them, no forbearance was shown them,\r\nnor can I discover in what has been done the faintest sign of sympathy\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nYet the Malay race can claim to have enlisted the sympathies of\r\nsome not undistinguished men. Rajah Brooke, Spenser St. John, Hugh\r\nClifford, Professor Blumentritt, Louis Becke, Joseph Conrad--the\r\nnames that first occur to me--have all confessed to an affection for\r\nthem. The old Spanish conquerors speak of their dignified courtesy\r\nand gentle manners.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, in America, generous souls who can judge\r\nthe Tagals fairly and even indulgently. I do not allude to those\r\nwho raise a clamour to discredit the administration for political\r\npurposes, but to the noble, eloquent, and truly patriotic speech,\r\ninspired in the best traditions of the United States, delivered by\r\nMr. Hoar in the Senate on April 17th. I hope that touching appeal to\r\nthe national conscience will bear fruit, and that, by the exercise\r\nof true statesmanship, an end may be put to this dreadful war, and\r\na pacification effected satisfactory to Filipinos and Americans.\r\n\r\nFor four long years, slaughter and destruction have ravaged one of\r\nthe fairest lands on earth, converting what might be a paradise into\r\na pandemonium.\r\n\r\nWhat evils have these poor Tagals not suffered in that time? Arbitrary\r\nimprisonment, torture, confiscation of property, banishment to\r\nunhealthy places, military executions, bombardments, the storming and\r\nburning of towns, indiscriminate slaughter, and the bubonic plague,\r\nadded to the calamities they are always exposed to--volcanic eruptions,\r\nfloods, earthquakes, typhoons, locusts, epidemics.\r\n\r\nFamine seems to be the only calamity they have been free from, but\r\neven that may not be far distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nRESOURCES OF THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\n    At the Spanish conquest--Rice--the lowest use the land\r\n    can be put to--How the Americans are misled--Substitutes\r\n    for rice--Wheat formerly grown--Tobacco--Compania\r\n    General de Tabacos--Abaca--Practically a monopoly of the\r\n    Philippines--Sugar--Coffee--Cacao--Indigo--Cocoa-nut oil--Rafts of\r\n    nuts--Copra--True localities for cocoa palm groves--Summary--More\r\n    sanguine forecasts--Common-sense view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgricultural.\r\n\r\nThe great wealth of the Archipelago is undoubtedly to be found in\r\nthe development of its agriculture. Although the Central and Ilocan\r\nMountains in Luzon and parts of Mindanao are rich in gold, it is the\r\nfertile land, the heavy rainfall and the solar heat, that must be\r\nutilized to permanently enrich the country. The land is there and the\r\nlabour is there, and all that is wanting is capital, and a settled\r\ngovernment that will make roads and bridges and keep them in repair,\r\nclear the rivers of obstructions and improve the ports, and above\r\nall, establish and maintain some tolerable courts of justice. The\r\nsun, the rain, the soil, and the hardy Philippine farmer will do the\r\nrest--a population equal to that of Java could live in affluence in\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the Philippines at the time of the first arrival\r\nof the Spaniards consisted mainly in the cultivation of rice. It is to\r\nthe Spaniards that the natives owe the introduction of maize, coffee,\r\ncacao, sesame, tobacco, the indigo plant, the sweet potato, and many\r\nfruits. They also imported horses, horned cattle, and sheep. But\r\nthe great development of the cultivation of sugar and hemp is almost\r\nentirely due to British capital, with some assistance from Americans.\r\n\r\nThe natives probably learned from the Chinese how to terrace the\r\nhillsides and the sloping lands, and how to erect the pilapiles, or\r\nsmall dykes, for retaining the rain. At that time, and for centuries\r\nafter, taxes were paid in paddy as they have been in Japan until\r\nquite recently.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading \"Tagals,\" a description is given of the planting\r\nof paddy, and an illustration shows the aspect of a newly-planted\r\npaddy-field or tubigan. Mountain rice-lands are called bacores or\r\ndalatanes. The cutting and harvesting of paddy is paid for in kind,\r\nsometimes in Camarines Sur, a third of the crop is given for getting\r\nit in, but in the province of Manila it is cultivated in equal shares\r\nto the farmer and the owner of the land.\r\n\r\nBy looking at the illustration it will be seen that, the fields\r\nbeing divided into such small patches of irregular shapes at\r\ndifferent levels, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to use a\r\nreaping-machine. I have elsewhere given the reasons for my opinion\r\nthat the cultivation of rice is the lowest use that the land and\r\nthe husbandmen can be put to, and whenever the cultivation is given\r\nup, it is probably an indication that the cultivators are raising\r\nsome more profitable crop, and earning money by exporting valuable\r\nproduce, wherewith to import rice from countries in a lower stage\r\nof civilisation.\r\n\r\nThis is most certainly the case in the Philippines, and year by year,\r\nas the exports of hemp, sugar and tobacco have increased, the imports\r\nof rice from Saigon and Rangoon have risen correspondingly. And yet the\r\nUnited States' Department of Agriculture, issued in the latter part of\r\n1899 a circular with the title,'Plant Products of the Philippines,'\r\n[15] which, amongst other inaccurate appreciations, says: \"It seems\r\nstrange that an almost exclusively agricultural country should not\r\nproduce enough food for its own population, but such is at present the\r\ncase with regard to the Philippines.\" It proceeds to say that in some\r\nyears the value of rice imported into Manila from Saigon was valued\r\nat $2,000,000. But I would point out to the author of that circular\r\nthat the export of the three great staples of the Philippines in\r\nthose years averaged, perhaps, $30,000,000, and this, evidently,\r\ncould not have been accomplished if they had cultivated their own rice.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards sometimes raised this same groundless clamour, and,\r\nperhaps, the author of the circular took it from them; but I look\r\nupon it as a great mistake arising from insufficient knowledge of\r\nthe subject. The rice imported into Manila is largely shipped to the\r\ntobacco and hemp provinces, Cagayan and Albay, where the people are\r\nexclusively employed in the cultivation and preparation of those\r\nvaluable products, and are far richer, and on a higher grade of\r\ncivilisation than the rice-growers of Cochin China.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines themselves, the people of the rice-growing districts\r\nare the poorest and most backward of all.\r\n\r\nBesides paddy, the natives cultivate the dava or mijo (Panicum\r\nmiliaceum), the mongo, a species of lentil (Phaseolus mungo), called\r\nin some provinces balat or balatong, for their own consumption.\r\n\r\nWhen rice is dear, they mix a certain amount of maize with it, and\r\nwhen it is really scarce they eat the seeds of the sorghum (Holcus\r\nsaccharatus) instead of it. They also make an infusion of these seeds,\r\nwhich is not unlike barley-water. The camote (Impomoea batata) is\r\nthe principal food of the more uncivilised tribes.\r\n\r\nAll the natives find a great resource in the banana, which the Tagals\r\ncalled saguin. The following varieties are excellent: Bungulan,\r\nLacatan, Ternate, and Tindoc.\r\n\r\nWheat was formerly grown in northern Luzon. The late Archbishop\r\nof Manila, Fray Pedro Payo, informed me that, when he was a parish\r\npriest years ago, he always ate bread made from Philippine flour,\r\nwhich he thought far better and safer than the Californian flour that\r\nhad superseded it.\r\n\r\nTobacco is an important crop in the Philippines, and from the year\r\n1781 was cultivated in Cagayan as a government monopoly. In the\r\nvillages of that province the people were called out by beat of drum\r\nand marched to the fields under the gobernadorcillo and principales,\r\nwho were responsible for the careful ploughing, planting, weeding,\r\nand tending, the work being overlooked by Spanish officials. Premiums\r\nwere paid to these and to the gobernadorcillos, and fines or floggings\r\nwere administered in default. The native officials carried canes,\r\nwhich they freely applied to those who shirked their work.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the book I have referred to the series of abuses\r\ncommitted under the monopoly: how the wretched cultivators had to\r\nbribe the officials in charge of the scales to allow them the true\r\nweight, and the one who classified the leaves, so that he should\r\nnot reject them as rubbish and order them to be destroyed; in fact,\r\nthey had to tip every official in whose power it was to do them any\r\ninjustice. Finally, they received orders on the treasury for the\r\nvalue of their tobacco, which were not paid for months, or, perhaps,\r\nfor years. They sometimes had to sell their orders for 50 percent of\r\nthe face value, or even less.\r\n\r\nHowever, even the Spanish official conscience can be aroused, and at\r\nthe end of 1882 the monopoly was abolished.\r\n\r\nHere it is only right to honourably mention a Spanish gentleman to\r\nwhom the natives of the Cagayan Valley in a great measure owe their\r\nfreedom. Don Jose Jimenez Agius was Intendente General de Hacienda,\r\nand he laboured for years to bring about this reform, impressed\r\nwith the cruelty and injustice of this worst form of slavery. The\r\nCagayanes were prohibited from growing rice, but were allowed as\r\nan indulgence to plant a row or two of maize around their carefully\r\ntilled tobacco-fields.\r\n\r\nPossibly this circumstance has led the author of the circular I have\r\nbefore quoted to make the extraordinary statement: \"Tobacco, as a\r\ncultivated crop, is generally grown in the same field as maize.\" Does\r\nhe think it grows wild anywhere?\r\n\r\nIn 1883, the \"Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas\" was established\r\nin the islands, the capital being raised in Paris and Barcelona.\r\n\r\nThis Company has been under very capable management; the technical\r\ndepartment being overlooked by M. Armand Villemer, a French engineer\r\nof great ability and experience. The Company has done a great deal\r\nto improve the cultivation of the plant and the preparation of the\r\nleaf. They run light draught paddle-steamers and barges on the Cagayan\r\nRiver, and sea-going screw-steamers from Aparri to Manila.\r\n\r\nTheir estates are mentioned under the heading \"Cagayanes.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the Cagayan Valley, the following Provinces produce tobacco\r\nin considerable quantities.\r\n\r\nIn Luzon, the Ilocos North and South, Abra, Union, Nueva Ecija. Also\r\nMasbate, Ticao, and most of the Visayas Islands. The Igorrote also\r\nraise a considerable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of tobacco and cigars exported since 1888 is given in\r\nthe Appendix; and, seeing the enormous extent of land still available\r\nin the Cagayan Valley, there can be no doubt that the production can\r\nbe very largely increased as the demand grows.\r\n\r\nThe export of leaf tobacco from Manila, the only shipping port, has\r\nincreased from 204,592 quintals in 1888, to 287,161 quintals in 1897,\r\nand during the same period the export of cigars has increased from\r\n109,109 mil to 171,410 mil.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the Musa textilis is almost a monopoly of the\r\nPhilippines, and, indeed, of certain parts of them.\r\n\r\nVolcanic soil, a certain elevation above the sea, and exposure to\r\nthe breezes of the Pacific, a bright sun and an ample rainfall,\r\nseem necessary to the production of a fine quality of this fibre.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to produce this fibre elsewhere; the\r\nGovernment of British India sent a gentleman to Manila to study the\r\nquestion. He wrote a report, but I have never heard that any abaca\r\nwas produced.\r\n\r\nThe plant was said to grow wild all along the Sarawak rivers; but\r\nhere again some mistake must have been made, for nothing seems to\r\nhave come of it.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, nothing so far to compete with it, and there\r\nis an immense and growing market. The price has lately fluctuated\r\nenormously, and I do not intend to prophesy what profits might be\r\nmade in planting it.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, no less than 915,338 bales were exported, about 114,400\r\ntons, and if we take the average price at that time as $15 per bale,\r\nwe get a sum of over $13,730,000 as the value of that year's export,\r\nthe largest in quantity, but not in value.\r\n\r\nThe export of hemp has been almost entirely developed by British and\r\nAmerican enterprise, and dates from very recent times.\r\n\r\nThe spread of the sugar-cane cultivation in the Philippines from the\r\nyear 1870 was rapid, and is in great measure due to the advances\r\nmade by British and American houses to the planters. It was for\r\nmany years a most profitable business, and this is proved by the\r\nlarge and handsome houses of the planters in the towns of the sugar\r\ndistricts. The continual increase of the beet sugar production, however\r\nbrought down prices to such an extent as to reduce the profits below\r\nthe heavy interest paid on loans or advances. But it seems now that\r\nbottom has been reached, and that rising prices and more economical\r\nmethods of financing and of manufacturing will give the planters a\r\nfresh start. Those who know what has been and is being done by central\r\nsugar factories in Cuba, will not doubt the possibility of doing\r\nbetter in the Philippines, where labour is cheaper and is on the spot.\r\n\r\nUnder the headings Pampangos, Pangasinanes, and Visayas, will be found\r\nmany interesting particulars of the working of sugar plantations in\r\nthese provinces.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, the export of sugar amounted to 260,000 tons; since then it\r\nhas declined, but in 1897 it still amounted to close on 200,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThe export of coffee has almost entirely ceased, and the cause is\r\nascribed to the ravages of an insect which destroys the bushes. Lipa,\r\nin Batangas province, was the great coffee centre, and became one\r\nof the richest towns in Luzon. Notwithstanding this prosperity, the\r\nplantations were never cultivated with proper care. Weeding was much\r\nneglected. In 1888, the export reached 107,236 piculs, but in 1897\r\nit had fallen to 2111 piculs.\r\n\r\nThere is an opening for coffee-planting on many of the elevated\r\nplateaux of the islands, and capital with skill ought to find its\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nThe Moros of Lake Lanao export a certain quantity of coffee of\r\nindifferent appearance but excellent flavour.\r\n\r\nCacao grows well in many parts of the Archipelago, but I have never\r\nseen any large plantations of it. A few trees may be seen in the\r\ngardens of old houses, but they must be protected from insects and\r\nrats, and require looking after.\r\n\r\nThe quantity raised in the islands is not sufficient to supply the\r\nhome demand, so that cacao beans are imported from Venezuela and\r\nchocolate from Spain.\r\n\r\nIt is a risky business to plant cacao in the northern Philippines;\r\nthe trees are delicate and suffer from the typhoons. And the produce\r\nis so valuable that, unless watched at night or protected in some way,\r\nthe cones may when nearly ripe be carried away by thieves.\r\n\r\nIn Palawan, where the typhoons do not ravage, I have seen cacao trees\r\n30 feet high, with an abundant crop.\r\n\r\nThe plant from which indigo is elaborated was cultivated in former\r\nyears to a considerable extent in some provinces, notably the Ilocos,\r\nbut the export trade was destroyed by the adulterations of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, 6672 quintals were exported from Manila, but only 462 quintals\r\nin 1896. Ten specimens of Ilocos indigo were shown at the Madrid\r\nExhibition of 1887, and the price varied from $12 to $67 per quintal.\r\n\r\nFor home use the dye is sold in a liquid form, contained in large\r\nearthen jars called tinajas. It is known as Tintarron.\r\n\r\nSesame and other oil-giving seeds are cultivated to a small extent\r\nin several provinces, but neither the seed nor the oil figure in the\r\nlist of exports.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-nut palm grows in most of the lowlands of the Philippines,\r\nexcept in the North of Luzon. In suitable soil it grows to the very\r\nedge of the sea, as in the Cuyos Islands, In the provinces of Laguna\r\nand Tayabas there are large numbers of these trees and a lively\r\nbusiness is carried on in making oil from nuts or in sending them to\r\nManila for the market or for shipment.\r\n\r\nWhen large quantities are to be sent, they are formed into rafts in\r\na very ingenious manner, each nut being attached by a strip of its\r\nown fibre without any rope being required.\r\n\r\nThese rafts are sometimes a hundred feet long and ten or twelve feet\r\nwide, and are navigated across the lake and down the Pasig. Finally\r\nthey are brought alongside a steamer, the nuts are cut adrift and\r\nthrown into the hold through the cargo ports.\r\n\r\nThe nuts that are to be used for making oil are stripped of their\r\nhusks and cut in halves. They then pass to a workman who is provided\r\nwith an apparatus called a Cutcuran. This is mounted upon a trestle\r\nand consists of a revolving shaft of hard polished wood, carrying\r\non its overhanging end an iron disc about three inches in diameter\r\nhaving teeth like the rowel of a spur.\r\n\r\nThis is set edgeways in a slot in the shaft. On each side of the\r\ntrestle near the ground is a treadle; from one of these a cotton\r\ncord passes over the shaft taking a round turn and is made fast\r\nto the other treadle. The operator sits astride the trestle with a\r\nfoot on each treadle. By working them alternately he produces a rapid\r\nrevolution of the shaft in alternate directions, and the cutting disc\r\nbeing double-edged it cuts both ways. By holding a half nut against\r\nthe revolving cutter he in a few seconds rasps out every particle of\r\nthe nut which falls upon a tray in fine shreds.\r\n\r\nThe shredded material is then heated in a cast-iron pan over a slow\r\nfire, and whilst hot is filled into bags of strong material which\r\nare placed in the press.\r\n\r\nThis is constructed entirely of hard wood, and the pressure is obtained\r\nby driving wedges with a heavy mallet.\r\n\r\nThe system is primitive, but all the apparatus is practical and\r\nvery cheap.\r\n\r\nD. Carlos Almeida of Binan stated to me in 1890 that 400 large\r\ncocoa-nuts gave by this process one tinaja or jar of oil, equivalent\r\nto 101/2 English gallons, which was then worth on the spot six Mexican\r\ndollars. It is sold in Manila. At this time cocoa-nuts were sold in\r\nSanta Cruz, the capital of the Laguna, for about $15 per thousand. The\r\noil cake was used either to feed pigs or as a manure about the roots\r\nof coffee-plants. The owner of cocoa-palm groves in Luzon or Visayas\r\nlives in anxiety during several months of each year, for should\r\nthe vortex of a typhoon pass over or near his plantation, a large\r\nproportion of his trees may be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe true locality for such plantations is in the southern and western\r\nparts of Mindanao and Palawan, to the south of a line drawn from\r\nthe northern point of Mindanao to Busuanga Island in the Calamianes,\r\npreferring the most sheltered spots.\r\n\r\nIn this region the danger from typhoons is inconsiderable, and the\r\ntrees flourish exceedingly. I have been shown trees in bearing at\r\nPuerta Princesa which I was assured were only three years old. I\r\nsaw older trees bearing immense bunches of nuts, too many to count,\r\nand it seemed wonderful to see a slender trunk bearing aloft sixty\r\nfeet in the air so heavy a load. From fifty to one hundred trees\r\ncan be planted on an acre according to the space allowed to each,\r\nand when in full bearing after six or seven years each tree might\r\ngive eighty nuts in a year. The crop goes on all the year round.\r\n\r\nCopra is prepared from the nuts either by drying the whole nut under\r\ncover in the shade, allowing the water to become absorbed and then\r\nbreaking up the kernel for bagging, or else by breaking it up first\r\nof all and drying it in the sun.\r\n\r\nIn the first case a large airy shed is required, and the process takes\r\nthree months. In the latter case three days of sunshine will suffice,\r\nbut the kernels must be protected from the dew at night and from any\r\nchance shower of rain. Artificial heat does not produce good copra,\r\nand besides is expensive to apply.\r\n\r\nMaking copra is one of the most paying enterprises in the Philippines,\r\nbut it requires capital to be laid out several years beforehand,\r\nunless a plantation can be bought to start with.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1890, the quantity of copra exported was so small that\r\nno record was kept of it. In that year 74,447 piculs were exported,\r\nand the trade has gone up by leaps and bounds, so that in 1897 no\r\nless than 811,440 piculs were sent out, over fifty thousand tons.\r\n\r\nThe present position of agriculture seems to be that there are in\r\nthe Philippines somewhere about six millions of civilised Christian\r\npeople tilling eight million acres of land, and exporting some thirty\r\nmillion dollars' worth of produce each year. They also raise a large\r\nquantity of food-stuffs for their own consumption, but import perhaps\r\na couple of million dollars' worth of rice because it is cheaper to\r\nbuy it than to grow it, as we in England import wheat for the same\r\nreason. The area of land under cultivation is computed at one-ninth\r\nof the total area of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe author of the circular Plant Products of the Philippines, to\r\nwhich I have before referred, makes the following remarks: \"In view of\r\nthe natural fertility of the soil and the vast extent of these rich\r\nlands not yet under cultivation, it is safely assumed that the total\r\nagricultural production of the islands could be increased tenfold.\"\r\n\r\nThis gentleman seems to be of a sanguine disposition, and he reminds\r\nme rather of Oscar F. Williams' cheerful optimism. But in one way he\r\nis more cautious than that gentleman. He does not fix a time for his\r\nprophecy to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nI would point out, however, that in the seventy-five million acres\r\ncomprised in the islands there are volcanic cones, peaks of basalt,\r\nstony plains, unexplored regions, swamps and other undesirable\r\nlocalities for establishing farms or plantations, and that some of the\r\ngood lands are held by warlike tribes who would resent any intrusion\r\ninto their domains.\r\n\r\nThere are, it is true, great tracts of land in Mindanao and Palawan,\r\nand no doubt in time they will come under cultivation.\r\n\r\nTaking everything into consideration, I hold to my view that with\r\npeace, honest government and a good Vagrancy law, the export of\r\nproduce might be doubled in twenty years if capital is forthcoming in\r\nsufficient amount. The land is worth nothing without the husbandmen,\r\nand it will take the Philippines a long time to recover from the\r\ndevastating effects of the insurrection of 1896-7 and the American\r\nwar of subjugation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nFORESTAL.\r\n\r\n    Value exaggerated--Difficulties of labour and transport--Special\r\n    sawing machinery required--Market for timber in the islands--Teak\r\n    not found--Jungle produce--Warning to investors in companies--Gutta\r\n    percha.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the three and a quarter centuries the Spaniards have held the\r\nPhilippines, the forests of Luzon have supplied enormous quantities\r\nof the finest timber for building houses, churches, convents, bridges,\r\nwarships, lighters and canoes. No care has ever been taken to replant,\r\nand the consequence is that at this day long logs of many kinds most\r\nwanted are not obtainable, all the large trees of valuable timber have\r\nlong ago been cut, and only in the most distant and least accessible\r\nplaces are any worth having to be found.\r\n\r\nThe greatest nonsense is talked about the value of the Philippine\r\nforests, but in fact it is only in the fever-stricken Island of\r\nMindoro, and in certain parts of Palawan and Mindanao, that any large\r\nand valuable trees can be found.\r\n\r\nLabour is a great difficulty; wood-cutters are scarce, and they are a\r\nwild, unruly lot; only men inured to such a rough life can resist the\r\nmalaria of the woods, and even they are occasionally down with fever.\r\n\r\nChinamen would not venture into the forests, and only the natives\r\nof each district are available, as they do not care to go far from\r\ntheir houses. In order to engage them it is necessary to make them\r\nadvances of money which it will seldom be possible to recover. A good\r\ndeal of tact is required in dealing with the cutters, they are very\r\nindependent and will not put up with abuse. A considerable capital\r\nis required to give advances to, and feed these men, also for buying\r\nbuffaloes, which die unless good care is taken of them.\r\n\r\nIf a cutter can be found who has buffaloes of his own, it is better\r\nto hire them with him, as then they are sure to be taken care of.\r\n\r\nThe dragging the large logs to a river or port can only be done by\r\nteams of buffaloes. The conditions prevailing prevent the employment\r\nof chutes, wire ropes and winding engines, or tram-lines.\r\n\r\nThe valuable trees do not grow together in numbers as in the forests\r\nof California and Oregon, but are found at considerable distances\r\nfrom each other. It is therefore only possible to commence the use\r\nof mechanical conveyance at the spot where the logs can be assembled\r\nby animal labour. Even so, the number of logs from any district will\r\nbe so small that it will hardly pay to lay down a tramway.\r\n\r\nThe logs are squared in the woods and the butt ends are rounded like\r\nthe runners of a sleigh, two holes are chopped at the top corners\r\nwith a small adze called a palacol, through which rattans are passed\r\nfor the buffaloes to be yoked to. They are then dragged down to the\r\nriver or sea. The wood is too heavy to float, and bundles of bamboos\r\nare attached to it to give it buoyancy.\r\n\r\nThe idea of putting up saw-mills in the forests is absurd--for the\r\nreason given above.\r\n\r\nThe wood is very hard and tough, and specially made machinery is\r\nrequired to work it.\r\n\r\nThe framing must be heavier, the feed lighter, and the teeth of\r\nthe saws much smaller and with less set. I have had some excellent\r\nmachinery and saws specially made in England for this purpose, by\r\nThomas Robinson & Son of Rochdale, but I sent home logs of the woods\r\nrequired to be worked, for the saws, planers, and moulding cutters\r\nto be made to suit. The ordinary sawing machinery as shown in trade\r\ncatalogues would be of no use at all.\r\n\r\nThe whole business is extremely risky, it requires a manager, immune\r\nto jungle fever, a man of great vigour yet patient and tactful. Such a\r\nman, understanding the native ways, would probably succeed after years\r\nof hard and dangerous work; but I warn any one thinking of taking up\r\nthis business that in Luzon valuable trees are few and far between,\r\nand distant from port or river, whilst in other islands where there\r\nare timber trees they stand there because no one could ever be induced\r\nto go and cut them.\r\n\r\nAs for exporting these timbers to the United States or other places,\r\nthere is no need to do that, for demand for timber in Manila and other\r\ntowns is greater than the supply, and iron construction is increasing\r\nin consequence.\r\n\r\nOregon or Norway pine is of no use for building purposes in the\r\nPhilippines, for it would be devoured within a year or two by the anay\r\n(white ants). I am told, however, that in spite of warnings the United\r\nStates military authorities have constructed stables and storehouses\r\nof this timber.\r\n\r\nI think it quite useless to mention the names of the different\r\nPhilippine timbers, as those who take an interest in them can purchase\r\nthe 'Manual de Maderero' (Wood-cutters' Manual) and obtain all the\r\ninformation they require from it.\r\n\r\nMolave is the most important, being proof against the white ants,\r\nand almost imperishable. Ypil and yacal are splendid woods for large\r\nroofs. They can be obtained long enough for tie-beams, even for wide\r\nspans, and excellent roof-frames can be made by bolting them together.\r\n\r\nOn the Zambales mountains and in Benguet and Lepanto there are\r\nforests of coniferae. When the Manila-Dagupan Railway was being\r\nbuilt, I had some sample sleepers brought down from thence. They\r\nwere quite suitable, but could only be used if thoroughly creosoted,\r\nas otherwise they would merely provide food for the white ants. As\r\nthere are no gasworks in the Islands, creosote could not be produced,\r\nnor would it pay to import it from Hong Kong or elsewhere on account\r\nof the freight and duties.\r\n\r\nThere is no market in the islands for pine and no one cuts the\r\ntrees. They are not of great size. The Igorrotes burn them to clear\r\nthe land for planting.\r\n\r\nTrue ebony is not found in the forests, but a very handsome and heavy\r\nwood, called Camagon, is the nearest approach to it, being dark-brown\r\nnearly black, streaked with bright yellow. It is found of larger size\r\nthan ebony and is sold by the pound.\r\n\r\nTeak has often been reported to exist and samples of the alleged\r\nteak have been shown to me. On comparing them with teak from\r\nRangoon a considerable difference was noted and the characteristic\r\nodour was absent. My own impression is that there is no teak in\r\nthe Philippines. I have paid two dollars a cubic foot for teak in\r\nManila and if there was any to be had, this price would, I think,\r\nhave fetched it out.\r\n\r\nAs for such jungle produce as gum-damar, canes, and rattans, if the\r\nreader will refer to my remarks on Palawan he will see that the most\r\nvaluable products are mostly worked out, and that in any case this\r\nis not white man's business.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one branch that, in view of increasing scarcity\r\nand rising price, should be carefully looked after by the Philippine\r\nAdministration; I refer to the collection of gutta-percha in\r\nMindanao. This caused quite a boom for a short time, but as usual\r\nthe Chinamen got hold of the stuff and mixed it with various kinds\r\nof rubbish, so that it was soon discredited in the European market.\r\n\r\nAn official of high-standing might be appointed to the double office of\r\nProtector of the Natives, and Conservator of the Forests in Mindanao,\r\nand rules for collecting the gutta without destroying the trees should\r\nbe prepared and enforced by personal visits from the conservator and\r\nhis deputies, to whom all the gutta should be handed, being paid for\r\nin cash. This would probably yield a large revenue to the Government\r\nand greatly benefit the natives, for they might receive half the value\r\nof the gutta instead of the minute fraction the Chinese now give them.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has perused the previous remarks will no longer be\r\nliable to be caught by tales of the fabulous riches of the Philippine\r\nforests. And, above all, he should keep clear of any companies that\r\nmay be formed to exploit them. Energetic and tactful individuals may\r\nsucceed, but the success will be due to personal qualities, and will\r\nbe contemporaneous with that gifted party and disappear with him. This\r\nis what happened to the \"Laguimanoc Saw Mills and Timber Company\"\r\nas soon as the founder left.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the jungle produce of Mindanao, Palawan, and\r\nthe smaller Southern Islands is smuggled away by the Chinese traders\r\nto Sandakan or Singapore.\r\n\r\nAll that appears in the Table of Exports is two or three hundred tons\r\nof gum copal shipped each year from Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE MINERALS.\r\n\r\n    Gold: Dampier--Pigafetta--De Comyn--Placers in\r\n    Luzon--Gapan--River Agno--The Igorrotes--Auriferous\r\n    quartz from Antaniae--Capunga--Pangutantan--Goldpits at\r\n    Suyuc--Atimonan--Paracale--Mambulao--Mount Labo--Surigao--River\r\n    Siga--Gigaquil, Caninon-Binutong, and Cansostral\r\n    Mountains--Misamis--Pighoulugan--Iponan--Pigtao--Dendritic gold\r\n    from Misamis--Placer gold traded away surreptitiously--Cannot\r\n    be taxed--Spanish mining laws--Pettifogging lawyers--Prospects\r\n    for gold seekers.

Amongst the authors are the mining\r\nengineers, Don Enrique Abella and Don Jose Centeno. But some of their\r\nmost important reports are still in manuscript, for the revenues of\r\nthe Philippines were almost entirely absorbed in paying the salaries\r\nof the officials, and there was a great disinclination to spend money\r\nin any other way.\r\n\r\nAt the Philippine Exhibition, held at Madrid in 1887, more than\r\nseven hundred specimens of auriferous earths or sand, gold quartz,\r\nand ores of various metals were shown, and in this branch alone there\r\nwere 109 exhibitors from all parts of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nBesides ores there were the tools and utensils used by the miners,\r\nand models of the furnaces and forges in which the metals were reduced\r\nand worked, with the metals in different stages of concentration or\r\nmanufacture, and a complete show of the finished products.\r\n\r\nA great many Mining Companies have been formed in Spain or in Manila\r\nat different times which have all failed from a variety of causes,\r\nwant of skill, bad management, costly administration, or because the\r\nrichness of the vein or seam had been exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of getting labour is considerable, as mining is a work\r\nthe generality of natives do not care to take up, although in some\r\nprovinces they are used to it, for example, in Camarines Norte and\r\nin Surigao.\r\n\r\nEmployers seem to forget that the ordinary food of a native, rice\r\nand fish, is not sufficiently nourishing to enable him to do hard\r\nand continuous work, such as is required in mining. A higher rate of\r\npay than the current wage is essential, to allow the miner to supply\r\nhimself with an ample ration of beef or pork, coffee and sugar,\r\nand provision should be made for him to be comfortably housed.\r\n\r\nIn this complaint of want of labour it is not always the native who\r\nis to blame, and if a mine cannot afford to pay a reasonable price\r\nfor labour, it had better stand idle.\r\n\r\nProbably the one great reason why mines have not prospered in the\r\nPhilippines is that there has never been slavery there, as in Cuba,\r\nPeru, Mexico, Brazil, ancient Egypt, and other great mining countries,\r\nwhere whole populations have been used up to minister to the avarice\r\nof their fellow-men.\r\n\r\nNames of some Metals in Tagal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Gold              Guinto.\r\n                    Silver            Pilac.\r\n                    Copper            Tangso.\r\n                    Lead              Tinga.\r\n                    Tin               Tinga puti.\r\n                    Iron              Bacal.\r\n                    Steel             Patalim.\r\n                    Forged Steel      Binalon.\r\n                    Coal              Uling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGold.\r\n\r\nFrom my remarks upon the other minerals it will be seen that I have\r\nno illusions on the immediate prospects of working them.\r\n\r\nWith gold, however, it is different. For centuries large quantities\r\nhave been collected or extracted, mostly, no doubt, from placers,\r\nstill some rich veins are known to exist.\r\n\r\nThe early writers agree that gold is plentiful. Dampier says: \"Most,\r\nif not all, the Philippine Islands are rich in gold.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Batanes Islanders, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They have no sort of coin, but they have small crumbs of the metal\r\nbefore described\" (he seemed at first to doubt whether it was gold),\r\nwhich they bind up very safe in plantain leaves or the like. This\r\nmetal they exchange for what they want, giving a small quantity of\r\nit--about two or three grains--for a jar of drink that would hold\r\nfive or six gallons. They have no scales, but give it by guess.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 'Relacion de las Islas Filipinas,' 1595(?), the author remarks\r\nthat the Tagals \"like to put on many ornaments of gold, which they\r\nhave in great abundance.\"\r\n\r\nFarther on, he says of Luzon:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The people of this island are very clever in knowing\" (valuing)\r\n\"gold, and they weigh it with the greatest subtleness and delicacy\r\nwhich has ever been seen; the first thing they teach their children\r\nis to know gold and the weights used for it, for amongst them there\r\nis no other money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFarther on, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ilocos ... has much gold, for the principal mines of these islands\r\nare in the mountain ranges of this province, of which they get the\r\nadvantage, for they trade with the miners more than any people. The\r\nSpaniards have many times endeavoured to people the mines so as to\r\nwork them, but it has not been possible up to the present, although\r\nthe Governor, Gonzalo Ronquillo, took the greatest pains, and it cost\r\nhim many men, the country being so rough and destitute of provisions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Pigafetta's 'Voyage Round the World' (Pinkerton), Vol. ii., p. 333,\r\nwe read that at Caraga (Mindanao) a man offered an ingot of massive\r\ngold for six strings of glass beads.\r\n\r\nOn p. 331, he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The king who accompanied us informed us that gold was found in his\r\nisland in lumps as large as walnuts, and even as an egg, mingled with\r\nearth; that they used a sieve for sifting it, and that all his vessels,\r\nand even many of the ornaments of his house were of this metal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn p. 348, he says that he saw many utensils of gold in the house of\r\nthe Raja or King of Butuan.\r\n\r\nOn p. 349, we find the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What most abounds is gold. Valleys were pointed out to me in which\r\nby signs they made me comprehend there were more lumps of gold than\r\nwe had hair on our heads, but that, for the want of iron, the mines\r\nexact greater labour to work them than they feel inclined to bestow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nComing down to later days, Thomas de Comyn, 1810, writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gold abounds in Luzon and in many of these islands; but as the\r\nmountains which contain it are in the power of pagan Indians, the veins\r\nare not worked, nor even the mines known. These savages collect it\r\nfrom placers or streams, and bring it as dust to the Christians who\r\ninhabit the plains, in exchange for coarse cloth or fire-arms, and\r\nat times they have brought it in grains of one or two ounces' weight.\r\n\r\n\"It is the general opinion that this class of mines abound in the\r\nprovince of Caraga, situated on the east of the great island of\r\nMindanao, and that there, as well as at various other points, gold\r\nis found of 22 carat fine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe states that the Royal Fifth, or rather Tenth (for it was found the\r\nmines could not pay a fifth, and it was reduced by half), in the year\r\n1809 amounted to $1144. This would represent an extraction of gold\r\nequal to only $11,440; but this was probably but a small part of the\r\nwhole, as from the circumstances of the case the gold dust from the\r\nwashings would be surreptitiously disposed of, and only the few mines\r\nthat were worked, paid the tax. I had occasion, about twelve years\r\nago, to make inquiry how much gold was raised in Camarines Norte,\r\nand a person well-informed on the subject estimated it at a value of\r\n$30,000 gold dollars.\r\n\r\nGold is certainly very widely distributed in the islands. I have\r\nseen women washing the sands of the River San Jose del Puray in the\r\nprovince of Manila, and noted what small specks they collected. I\r\nwas informed that their average earnings were about 25 cents per\r\nday. Whether these sands could be dredged and washed mechanically on\r\na large scale with profit I cannot say.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, I ascended the Puray River and went up the Arroyo Macaburabod\r\nto where it bifurcates. There, close to the boundary of the province\r\nof Manila and district of Moron, I found a face of disintegrated\r\nquartz glittering with large crystals of iron pyrites.\r\n\r\nThis was near a geological frontier where the igneous and sedimentary\r\nrocks joined, and the neighbourhood was highly mineralized, there being\r\niron, coal, and gold within a short distance. I took a large number\r\nof samples, and the analyst Anacleto del Rosario declared that one\r\nof them gave an assay of 17 dwts. of gold to the ton. But of course\r\nsuch assays prove nothing, for the accidental presence of a grain of\r\ngold in the sample would make all the difference in the results.\r\n\r\nNear Gapan in Nueva Ecija more profitable washings are situated,\r\nand at times large numbers of men and women are to be seen at work,\r\nespecially after a sudden flood has come down. The sands of the River\r\nAgno also yield gold, and the washing for it is quite an industry\r\namongst the Pangasinan women about Rosales, but the return is said\r\nto be small. But after a north-westerly gale has heaped up the black\r\nsand at the mouth of this river in the Bay of Lingayen, the people\r\nturn out in numbers to wash it, and sometimes have better luck. But\r\nalthough these washings are poor, a considerable quantity of gold\r\nis obtained from the Igorrotes, and there is no doubt that these\r\npeople have for centuries worked quartz veins or pockets, and that\r\nthey only extract sufficient for their modest requirements in the way\r\nof purchasing cattle, cloth, and tools. They do not hoard any gold,\r\nfor they say that it is safer in the mine than in their houses. When\r\none of them requires a few ounces he goes to his mine, gets it out,\r\nand immediately proceeds to purchase what he wants. Possibly they\r\ndo not consider the supply inexhaustible, and they have thought for\r\nto-morrow, or for those who will come after them. It is not their\r\nobject to exhaust the bounties of nature in the shortest possible time.\r\n\r\nWhen they have found a rich pocket they build a house over the pit,\r\nand when not at work they cover the hole with roughly-hewn planks or\r\nlogs ; they take precautions in disposing of the detritus, so that\r\nit does not call attention from a distance.\r\n\r\nIn the Exhibition of 1887 the Comandante Politico-Militar of\r\nthe Province of Benguet showed samples of auriferous quartz from\r\nAntaniac and from Capunga, also quartz with visible threads of gold\r\nfrom the latter place, also leaf gold from the veins, two specimens\r\nof auriferous quartz from Pangutantan with gold extracted from it,\r\nand gold-dust from the River Agno.\r\n\r\nOther exhibits included specimens of gold-bearing rock from Lepanto\r\nand Infantas, and compact auriferous quartz from the celebrated\r\ngold-pits of Suyuc near Mancayan. All these quartz reefs are worked\r\nby the Igorrotes.\r\n\r\nGold is also found near Atimonan in Tayabas, but the neighbourhood of\r\nParacale and Mambulao, and the slopes of Mount Labo are most famous\r\nin Manila.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century large quantities of gold were taken from\r\nthe surface-workings, which are now exhausted, or only afford a\r\nmiserable living to the natives who treat the auriferous earths in\r\na very primitive way.\r\n\r\nThe gold having been taken, the next thing was to use the reputation of\r\nthe mines to attract capital, and this was done to some considerable\r\nextent, one company being founded on the ruins of another. One of the\r\nlater ones was the \"Ancla de Oro,\" or Golden Anchor, but its capital\r\nwas expended without results. The late Don Antonio Enriquez, a Spanish\r\ngentleman well-known to British and Americans in Manila, worked some\r\nmining properties there for some years, and had faith in them.\r\n\r\nHe consulted me about them, and I forwarded some samples of the ores\r\nto my agents in London, who had them analyzed by Messrs. Johnson &\r\nMatthey, but the results were not encouraging, and did not confirm\r\nthe analysis made in Manila.\r\n\r\nAbout 1890, Messrs. Peele, Hubbell & Co. got out an American mining\r\nexpert, whose name I forget, but I believe he was a mining engineer\r\nof high standing. He spent some time at Mambulao and Paracale, and\r\nmade a careful examination of the country. It was understood that\r\nhis report did not encourage any further expenditure in prospecting\r\nor development. But of late years further attempts have been made to\r\nboom the place, and the Mambulao Gold Mining Syndicate, London, 1893,\r\nhas been formed. I am unaware on what new information the promoters\r\nrely to justify their bringing this place again before the public.\r\n\r\nSurigao, in the old kingdom of Caraga, is rich in gold which is very\r\nwidely disseminated. Father Llovera, a missionary who, in March, 1892,\r\nmade an excursion up the River Siga to visit some unbaptized Mamanuas\r\nin the mountains, declares that the sands contain much gold, so much\r\nso that particles were plainly visible. This river takes its rise in\r\nthe eastern Cordillera, between Cantilan and Jabonga, and runs in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction into the southern part of Lake Mainit. The\r\nmissionary also declares that veins of gold were visible in some of\r\nthe pieces of rock lying in the bed of the river, which they broke\r\nto examine. But he does not seem to have brought back any specimens,\r\nas one would expect.\r\n\r\nHis declaration is confirmed by Dr. Montano, a French traveller and\r\nskilled explorer, who however does not say that he saw the gold dust\r\namongst the sand.\r\n\r\nFrom Surigao to Gigaquil the people are engaged in washing the sands\r\nfor gold.\r\n\r\nForeman states that for many months remittances of four or five\r\npounds weight of gold were sent from Mindanao to a firm in Manila,\r\nand that it was alluvial gold from Surigao extracted by the natives.\r\n\r\nDon Jose Centeno, Inspector of Mines, says in a report: \"The most\r\nimportant workings effected in Surigao are in the Caninon-Binutong\r\nand Cansostral mountains, a day's journey from the town.\r\n\r\n\"These mountains consist of slaty talc much metamorphosed, and of\r\nserpentine. In the first are found veins of calcite and quartz from\r\nhalf-an-inch to three inches thick, in which especially in the calcite\r\nthe gold is visible mixed with iron and copper pyrites, galena and\r\nblende. It is a remarkable circumstance that the most mineralized\r\nveins run always in an east and west direction, whilst the poor\r\nand sterile veins always follow another direction. The workings are\r\nentirely on the surface, as the abundance of water which flows to\r\nthem prevents sinking shafts, and nothing is known of the richness\r\nat depth. Rich and sterile parts alternate, the gold being mostly in\r\npockets. From one of the veins in Caninoro in a length of eighteen\r\ninches one hundred ounces of gold were taken.\"\r\n\r\nSome time after this find, Messrs. Aldecoa & Co., a Manila firm,\r\nerected stamps at Surigao, and a certain amount of gold was sent up by\r\nevery steamer to Manila, but in spite of the apparently favourable\r\ncircumstances, the enterprise was ultimately abandoned and the\r\nmachinery removed.\r\n\r\nI do not know the reason, but people in Manila are so used to the\r\ncollapse of mining companies that it is regarded as their natural\r\nand inevitable end, and no explanations are required.\r\n\r\nNieto (p. 75) mentions the northern parts of the province of Surigao\r\nand Misamis as the richest in gold. In Misamis there is both alluvial\r\ngold and rich quartz reefs, the richest known spots being Pighoulugan\r\non the River Cagayan, Iponan and Pigtao. The ore at the latter place\r\nis auriferous iron pyrites, called by the natives Inga.\r\n\r\nNuggets weighing from two and a half to four ounces have been found in\r\nthese places, so that Pigafetta's stories are not without foundation.\r\n\r\nOn March 20th, 1888, a clerk of Don Louis Genu, a merchant in Manila,\r\ncalled upon me on business and exhibited a large pickle bottle full\r\nof gold which he had just received from Cagayan de Misamis. There\r\nwere several pounds weight of it, and I carefully examined it with\r\na lens. I found it in pieces, many of them half an inch or more in\r\nlength, slightly flattened, and having minute particles of white\r\nquartz adhering to them, and a few loose particles of quartz. The\r\npieces were not water-worn, and had evidently formed part of a seam\r\nof dendritic or lace gold, such as I had seen exhibited by a vendor\r\nof mining properties in Denver, Col., just a year before.\r\n\r\nThis exhibit opened my eyes to the possibilities of gold mining in\r\nMindanao, but I did not leave my business to go prospecting.\r\n\r\nThe natives of this part of Mindanao look upon washing for gold as\r\ntheir chief resource. A certain quantity of what they collect is used\r\nto make ornaments, and passes from hand to hand instead of coin in\r\npayment of gambling debts, and stakes lost at cockfights. The Mestizos\r\nand Chinamen get hold of the rest and send it away surreptitiously,\r\nso that no statistics can be collected. It is impossible to tax gold\r\ncollected in this way, but the Government might derive a profit by\r\nestablishing posts in each district where gold would be purchased\r\nat a fixed price and so get, say, ten or twenty per cent. out of it\r\ninstead of allowing the Chinese and Mestizos to make perhaps forty\r\nor fifty per cent. according to the ignorance of the vendor.\r\n\r\nForeman is probably quite right in saying that the influence of the\r\nfriars has always been exerted against any mining company, whether\r\nSpanish or foreign. They did not want a rush of miners and Jews to\r\nthe Philippines. But now, under the American Government, their power\r\nmust decline, and new undertakings will, in a measure, be free from\r\nthis hindrance.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish mining laws and regulations are excellent and a perfect\r\nmodel for legislation on the subject. They are based on the principle\r\nthat the ownership of the surface gives no title to the minerals\r\nunderneath, which belong to the State. The owner can, however, obtain\r\na title by developing a mine.\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity and unscrupulousness of that vile breed, the native\r\nPica-Pleito or pettifogging lawyer, has greatly contributed to stop\r\nEuropeans from proceeding with mining enterprises, as success would\r\nbring down these blackmailers in swarms.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the new government will lay a heavy hand on\r\nthese birds of prey. Rightly considered, they are only a species of\r\nvermin, and should have verminous treatment.\r\n\r\nNow that the fortune of war has handed over the sovereignty of the\r\nPhilippines to an enterprising and energetic race, I cannot doubt\r\nthat the mystery of centuries will be dispelled.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Californian, Colorado, or Nevada volunteers, there\r\nshould be men having the courage, the knowledge of prospecting,\r\nand the physical strength necessary for success in this quest, if\r\nthey can obtain permission from their superiors to attempt it. The\r\nprospects are so good that they should not have any difficulty in\r\ngetting capitalists to finance them.\r\n\r\nThey will require to go in a strong party to prevent being cut off\r\nby the savages, and to escort their supplies of provisions.\r\n\r\nAs deer and wild pig abound they will be able to supply themselves in a\r\ngreat measure with meat by sending out a couple of good shots to hunt.\r\n\r\nFor such as these gold mining ought to be most remunerative, and\r\nenable those who survive the many perils to retire with a fortune\r\nafter a few years of hard work. But so far as I know there is not at\r\npresent sufficient information about any mines in the Philippines,\r\nwhether of gold or any other metal, to warrant the establishment of\r\ncompanies for purchasing and working them.\r\n\r\nMining claims can be staked out and registered under the present\r\nlaws by natives or foreigners, but in limited areas, and placers or\r\nriver beds can be worked by all without leave or license, and cannot\r\nbe monopolised.\r\n\r\nI wish to avoid prophesy, but I shall be much surprised if the\r\nPhilippines, in American hands, do not turn out in a few years an\r\nimportant gold-producing country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopper.\r\n\r\nNative copper has been found in several places in the islands,\r\namongst them are Surigao and Torrijos in Mindoro.\r\n\r\nIn the article on the Igorrotes, I have spoken of the copper mines\r\nof Mancayan, and related how, when worked by the savages they were\r\nsuccessful to the extent of supplying themselves with cooking-pots,\r\ntrays and ornaments, besides leaving an annual surplus of about\r\nnineteen tons of copper, which was sold.\r\n\r\nA Spanish company obtained the concession about 1864, and drove out\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\nThe title was the Sociedad Minera de Mancayan, and they experienced\r\nconsiderable difficulties in getting a merchantable product, their\r\nscience being at a disadvantage compared to the practical knowledge\r\nof the Igorrotes. They, however, persevered, and got up to a make of\r\nabout 180 tons in one year--nearly ten times the production obtained\r\nby the Igorrotes. But the usual fate of Philippine mining companies\r\novertook them, and the works were closed in 1875, it was said from\r\nscarcity of labour.\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of ores are found at Mancayan, almost on the surface,\r\nred, black and grey copper, also sulphates and carbonates of copper.\r\n\r\nAbout Mambulao cupro-ferruginous quartz and copper pyrites are found,\r\nbut are not worked.\r\n\r\nI am quite unable to venture any opinion on the prospects of\r\ncopper-mining and smelting in the Philippines, but no doubt experts\r\nwill shortly obtain the necessary data to decide what can be done,\r\nbut capital should be laid out with great caution, and the many\r\ndifficulties of climate, carriage and labour taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIron.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of iron ore in the Philippines. In Luzon it occurs\r\nplentifully in the western spurs of the Cordillera all the way from\r\nBosoboso to San Miguel de Mayumo, and it is now worked near the latter\r\nplace in a primitive way. Plough-shares, cooking-pots and bolos are the\r\nprincipal productions; the fuel used in all cases is charcoal. I sent\r\nto the Philippine Exhibition of 1887 at Madrid a dozen bolos made from\r\nnative iron. The ore is very rich, giving 70 to 80 per cent. of iron;\r\nwhen polished it is of a beautiful silvery white colour, very tough,\r\nand of the finest quality. Attempts have been made by Europeans to\r\nwork the iron ores of Luzon, but they have invariably ended in the\r\nbankruptcy of the adventurers, and in one case even in suicide.\r\n\r\nWhen deer-shooting at the Hacienda de San Ysidro above Bosoboso many\r\nyears ago, I learned from the natives there that in the next valley,\r\nnot far from the hamlet of Santa Ines, there existed the remains\r\nof some old iron-works, abandoned years ago. They said there were\r\nunfinished forgings still lying about, amongst them two anchors. I\r\ndid not, however, go to examine them, being intent on shooting.\r\n\r\nRed hematite is found in Cebu, brown hematite in Paracale and other\r\nparts of Camarines Norte, and both red and brown in Capiz. In Misamis\r\noxydized iron is found. Some of the iron about San Miguel de Mayumo\r\nis magnetic.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that at present, and for many years to come, it is\r\npossible to work these ores and make iron and steel to compete with\r\nAmerican or British imported iron.\r\n\r\nBut the time may come when, under different conditions, these\r\nremarkable ores may be turned to account; in fact, it is asserted a\r\nscarcity of high class iron ore will soon occur, in which case the\r\nPhilippine ores of such extraordinary richness will come into use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoal.\r\n\r\nIt is common to see coal mentioned amongst the mineral resources of\r\nthe Philippines, but so far as I have been able to learn, no true\r\ncoal has been found there, nor in any of the adjacent islands. There\r\nare beds of lignite of varying quality, and when enthusiastic finders\r\nare told of the poor quality of their samples, they reply at once,\r\n\"It will be better at depth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Philippine formations seem to greatly resemble those of Borneo,\r\nand there it was found that the lignite got poorer at depth, so that\r\nmines were abandoned from this cause alone.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine beds of lignite have been violently upheaved by the\r\ncataclysms of former ages, and are often turned up vertically,\r\nas at the mines of Sugud in Albay. I was consulted about these\r\nmines after a considerable sum had been thrown away. The Spanish\r\nengineer employed commenced by building himself a commodious house;\r\nhe then laid a tramway from the port to where the mine was to be,\r\nand bought a winding engine. The available capital was expended,\r\nand nothing more was done.\r\n\r\nThe position of the seams at Sugud very much resembles the occurrence\r\nof the seams at the Pengaron mine in Borneo, which stopped work 18th\r\nOctober, 1884, after a precarious existence of thirty-six years, on\r\naccount of the poor quality of the coal and the relatively high cost\r\nof extraction. This is on the authority of Dr. Theodor Posewitz in\r\n'Borneo: its Geology and Mineral Resources,' 1892, and what follows\r\nso exactly applies to all the so-called coal in the Philippines,\r\nthat I shall quote the paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 480.--\"A number of analyses were carried out, and practical tests\r\nwere applied on board various ships. The result was always ore or\r\nless favourable, yet nobody would have the coal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coal mine in the British Colony of Labuan was given up after\r\nseveral years' working.\r\n\r\nPeople blame the Spanish Government, the priests, the natives,\r\nthe roads, but the reason of failure in the Philippines is very\r\nsimple. \"Nobody would have the coal,\" that is to say on board ship. The\r\nlignite could be used on land, but there is little demand for it,\r\nexcept for navigation. Some of it is liable to spontaneous combustion\r\nin the bunkers, some is so charged with sulphur as to be bad for the\r\nfurnaces, or else it will not keep steam. I doubt if there is any good\r\ncoal between Japan and Australia, and as long as coal from there can\r\nbe delivered at present prices in Manila, I don't advise anybody to put\r\nmoney into Philippine coal unless they know more about it than I do.\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that the Philippines have never been\r\nexplored. This is, however, only true of certain regions, and as\r\nregards beds of the so-called coal you will find them marked on the\r\nmaps all over the principal islands.\r\n\r\nIf you proceed to the village nearest the spot, you will find, very\r\nprobably, that the seam has been known for a century, and that pits or\r\nadits have been made and a lot of money spent to no purpose. Nobody\r\never made any money out of Philippine lignite that I know of, but I\r\ndon't prophesy whether anybody ever will.\r\n\r\nI append an analysis of some so-called coal that was brought me from\r\nMasbate in 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Analysis of Masbate Lignite.\r\n\r\n    Laboratory of A. del Rosario y Sales.\r\n\r\n    No. 1367. 16th April, 1889.\r\n\r\n    Lignite from Masbate.\r\n\r\n        Colour, black.\r\n        Physical condition, fragile.\r\n        Fracture, splintery.\r\n        Colour, when reduced to powder, blackish brown.\r\n        Burns with difficulty, giving a short flame; not very smoky, and\r\n        leaves a brick-red ash.\r\n        Coke not very spongy, pulverulent and lightly agglutinated.\r\n        Density at 33 deg.

This ore is often found mixed with iron or copper pyrites,\r\nand sometimes with blende.\r\n\r\nI have seen samples of galena from Cebu which was said to be\r\nauriferous, but I have never heard that any of these ores have been\r\nworked anywhere in the islands.\r\n\r\nIf it should be found profitable to smelt the gold-bearing ores, as\r\nis so splendidly done at Denver, Col., the galena will be necessary\r\nto the success of the process.\r\n\r\nRed Lead is found in Camarines Norte and other places.\r\n\r\nGraphite.--In 1891 some pieces of this valuable mineral were shown\r\nto me by a native, who said he had found the ore in Mindoro, but he\r\nwould not say from what locality.\r\n\r\nQuicksilver.--I have seen small bottles of this handed round by\r\nnative disciples of Ananias. But I have never seen a bit of cinnabar\r\nor other ore of mercury, and I shall not believe there is any of this\r\nmetal in the Philippines until I see the ore in situ, or have good\r\ntestimony to that effect.\r\n\r\nSulphur abounds; there are several places where it can be obtained\r\nin large quantities near the volcanoes.\r\n\r\nAsbestos.--This curious mineral would not strike a native as being\r\nof value.\r\n\r\nAll I can say about it is that at the Madrid Exhibition of 1887 a\r\nspecimen of this substance was shown by the Civil Governor of Ilocos\r\nNorte as having been found in that province.\r\n\r\nYellow Ochre is found in Batangas, Camarines, Albay, Leyte and Antique,\r\namongst other places.\r\n\r\nKaolin is found in Manila, Batangas and Camarines Sur, and probably\r\nin many other places.\r\n\r\nMarble of a yellowish colour has been quarried at Montalban. I\r\nhave used some of it, but found it full of faults, and not very\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nPlastic Clays for pottery and for making bricks and tiles abound.\r\n\r\nMineral Waters.--As might be expected in a volcanic region, hot\r\nsprings and mineral waters of very varied constituents abound.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the analyses of these would interest the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nI may say that I have derived great benefit from the hot-springs of\r\nLos Banos on the lake, and greatly regretted that I could not remain\r\nat the extraordinary vapour baths of Tibi near Tabaco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURES AND INDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\n    Cigars and cigarettes--Textiles--Cotton--Ahaca--Jusi--Rengue--Nipis\r\n    --Saguran--Sinamay--Guingon--Silk handkerchiefs--Pina--Cordage--\r\n    Bayones--Esteras--Baskets--Lager beer--Alcohol--Wood oils and\r\n    resins--Essence of Ylang-ilang--Salt--Bricks--Tiles--Cooking-pots--\r\n    Pilones--Ollas--Embroidery--Goldsmiths' and silversmiths' work--\r\n    Salacots--Cocoa-nut oil--Saddles and harness--Carromatas--Carriages\r\n    --Schooners--Launches--Lorchas--Cascos--Pontines--Bangcas--Engines\r\n    and boilers--Furniture--Fireworks--Lanterns--Brass Castings--Fish\r\n    breeding--Drying sugar--Baling hemp--Repacking wet sugar--Packing\r\n    tobacco and cigars--Oppressive tax on industries--Great future for\r\n    manufactures--Abundant labour--Exceptional intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufactures of the Philippines, such as they are, have been\r\nmentioned when describing the different tribes or peoples and only\r\na summary is necessary here.\r\n\r\nThe making of cigars and cigarettes employs probably 30,000 people in\r\nthe Province of Manila, the vast majority being women. But the best\r\ncigars are made by men who have been trained under skilled operatives\r\nbrought from Havana.\r\n\r\nA vast improvement has taken place since the Government monopoly has\r\nbeen abolished, and now the Manila cigars are as well-made and are\r\nput up in as tastefully decorated boxes as the Havanas.\r\n\r\nCigarettes are now largely made by machines; the Compania de Tabacos\r\nde Filipinas having rows of them in their factories.\r\n\r\nTextiles are made in hand-looms all over the Archipelago by the women\r\nin their spare time.\r\n\r\nBut in certain Provinces large numbers of women are regularly employed\r\nat the loom-working for those who make a business of it. In Ilocos and\r\nUnion very excellent coverlets, sheets, serviettes, handkerchiefs and\r\ntowels are woven from cotton, as well as the fabrics called abaca,\r\njusi or rengue, nipis, saguran, sinamay and guingon. This last is\r\nvery suitable for military or naval uniforms; it is a blue cotton\r\ncloth similar to what sailors call dungaree.\r\n\r\nIn some of the towns of Pampanga and Bulacan, notably in Baliuag\r\nwhere the people are specially clever and industrious, excellent silk\r\nhandkerchiefs are woven. In Camarines and Albay the fabrics of abaca\r\nare more commonly woven, and in Cebu the women are accustomed to work\r\nat the loom.\r\n\r\nBut it is from Ilo-ilo and neighbourhood that a very large trade is\r\ndone with the other islands in many kinds of textiles. There also the\r\nVisayas work industriously at it as a trade and produce most beautiful\r\nfabrics of pina, silk, cotton, and abaca, as well as the cheaper sorts\r\nfor the use of the working classes. In some of the mixed materials a\r\nbeautiful effect is produced by running stripes of silk, either white\r\nor of the most brilliant colours, lengthways through the piece. I\r\nhave sent some of these jusi dress fabrics to ladies in England and\r\nthey have been greatly appreciated when made up by a bonne faiseuse.\r\n\r\nThey are very suitable for wearing in the Philippines or elsewhere\r\nin the tropics, being light and gauzy. This material, as well as\r\nsome of the other fine gauzy fabrics, takes a long time to make in\r\na hand-loom, the advance is imperceptible. I should like to put some\r\nof the calumniators of the Filipinos to work a hand-loom and make a\r\ndress-length of jusi. I think every one would recant before he had\r\nmade a yard.\r\n\r\nAt the Philippine Exhibition of 1887 there were more than three hundred\r\nexhibitors of textiles, and one of them, the Local Board of Namaypacan\r\nin the Province of Union, showed one hundred and forty-five different\r\nkinds of cloths.\r\n\r\nThere are several rope-works at Manila and the material used is abaca,\r\nthe ropes produced are equal to any to be had anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn Camarines Sur both harness and hammocks are made from this material.\r\n\r\nIn the Provinces ropes are made of cabo-negro, a black fibre from the\r\nwild palm, said to be indestructible; of buri, of fibre from the anabo,\r\nof the bark of the lapuit, and of rattan. Bayones or sacks for sugar,\r\nesteras or sleeping mats, hats and cigar cases, and baskets of all\r\nsorts, are made at different places and from the commonest up to the\r\nvery finest. That called the Tampipi is now regularly kept in stock\r\nin London, and is very handy for travelling.\r\n\r\nThere is a lager beer brewery in Manila that must have piled up money\r\nsince the American garrison arrived.\r\n\r\nAlcohol is distilled both from sugar and from the juice of the\r\nnipa-palm (Nipa fructicans).\r\n\r\nThe oils and resins of Ilocos have been mentioned when describing the\r\nIlocanos; they are not exported, finding a ready market in the country.\r\n\r\nEssence of Ylang-ylang is distilled in Manila and other towns; it\r\nused to fetch formerly 1000 francs per kilogramme.\r\n\r\nSalt is made at many places between Paranaque and Cavite.\r\n\r\nBricks, tiles, cooking pots [bangas], stoves [calanes], sugar moulds\r\n[pilones], and draining pots for the pilones [ollas], are made in\r\nmany provinces.\r\n\r\nThe industry of the women is also shown by the very beautiful\r\nembroideries of all sorts, either in white or coloured silks or in\r\ngold or silver. Some of this latter work, however, is done by men.\r\n\r\nIn some cases they introduce seed-pearls or brilliant fish-scales in\r\ntheir work. The slippers worn by the women on grand occasions are\r\noften works of art, being richly embroidered in silver and gold on\r\ncherry coloured velvet.\r\n\r\nSome notable pieces of goldsmiths' and silversmiths' work have been\r\ndone in Manila, and in the provinces some of the natives carve bolo\r\nhandles and other articles out of buffalo horn and mount them in\r\nsilver with much taste.\r\n\r\nThe salacots, or native hats, are beautifully woven by hand from\r\nnarrow strips of a cane called nito [lygodium], and the headmen have\r\nthem ornamented with many pieces of repousse silver (see Illustration).\r\n\r\nCocoa-nut oil is expressed in the province of the Laguna, in Manila\r\nand other places. Soap of the ordinary kind is manufactured from it.\r\n\r\nSaddles and harness are made in all the leading towns, and the ordinary\r\ncountry vehicle, the carromata, is made in the chief towns of provinces\r\nand some others; but some of the components, such as the springs,\r\nand axle-arms and boxes are imported. But in Manila really elegant\r\ncarriages are constructed, the leather for the hoods, the cloth for\r\nthe linings, the lamps, as well as a good deal of the ironwork, being,\r\nhowever imported.\r\n\r\nIn former years large frigates have been built, armed, and fitted out\r\nat Cavite and other ports, but at present the ship-building industry\r\nis in decadence, and the shipwrights capable of directing so important\r\na job have died out. The increasing scarcity and high price of timber\r\nis now a difficulty, and sailing vessels are in little demand. Small\r\nsteamers and launches are now built, but larger steamers are ordered\r\nfrom Hong Kong or Singapore, or, in case of vessels well able to make\r\nthe passage, the order goes to England.\r\n\r\nThe native craft called lorchas, pailebotes, pontines, barotos, paraos,\r\ncascos, guilalos, barangayanes, bangcas, vintas and salisipanes are\r\nstill built in large numbers. The last are very light and fast craft\r\nused by the Moros on their piratical expeditions.\r\n\r\nEngines and boilers for steam launches are made in Manila, church\r\nbells are cast of a considerable size; iron castings are also made.\r\n\r\nAmongst the miscellaneous articles manufactured are all sorts of\r\nhousehold furniture, fireworks and lanterns. Dentists, painters,\r\nsculptors and photographers all practise their trades.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Filipinos have learnt a certain amount\r\nfrom the Spaniards as regards their manufactures; but, on careful\r\nconsideration, I think they have learnt more from the Chinese. Their\r\nfirst sugar-mills were Chinese and had granite rollers, and from them\r\nthey learnt the trick that many a moulder might not know, of casting\r\ntheir sugar-pans in a red-hot mould and cooling slowly and so getting\r\nthe metal extremely thin yet free from defects. The casting of brass\r\ncannon and of church bells has been learnt from them, and doubtless\r\nthey taught the Igorrotes how to reduce the copper ores and to refine\r\nthat metal. Again, the breeding of fish, an important business near\r\nManila, and the manufacture of salt round about Bacoor comes from\r\nthem. I am not sure whether the hand-loom in general use is of the\r\nChinese pattern, but I think so.\r\n\r\nDistilling the nipa juice is certainly a Chinese industry, as also\r\nthe preparation of sugar for export. This is done in establishments\r\ncalled farderias, and is necessary for all sugar made in pilones\r\nor moulds. The procedure is described under the head of Pampangos,\r\nand an illustration is given of the process of drying the sugar on\r\nmats in the sun.\r\n\r\nMany native men and women and numbers of Chinese coolies are employed\r\nin Manila, Ilo-ilo, and Cebu in preparing produce for shipment.\r\n\r\nThe hemp used to come up from the provinces loose or merely twisted\r\ninto rolls to be pressed into bales at the shipping ports, but of\r\nlate years several presses have been erected at the hemp ports in\r\nSouthern Luzon and on the smaller islands.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of hemp-presses in Manila, each requiring about\r\nsixty coolies to work it, and one or two clerks to attend to the\r\nsorting and weighing.\r\n\r\nThey were paid so much per bale pressed.\r\n\r\nSteam, or hydraulic presses, would long ago have been substituted but\r\nfor the fact that the clerks or personeros were each allowed one or\r\ntwo deadheads on the pay list, and this was so profitable to them\r\nthat they strongly opposed any changes, and none of the merchants\r\ncared to take the risk of the innovations.\r\n\r\nTwo presses were set in line, astride a pair of flat rails, a small\r\none called the Bito-bito for the first pressure on the pile of hemp,\r\nand the large one to squeeze down the bale to its proper size.\r\n\r\nThey were simply screw presses having hardwood frames set deep into\r\nmassive stone foundations and surrounded by a granite pavement.\r\n\r\nA pair of these presses, i.e., a Bito-bito and a press erected in\r\nManila under my direction in 1888, cost $4400, the woodwork foundation\r\nand pavement costing $2850, and the screws, nuts, capstan-heads,\r\netc., costing $1550. The small press had a screw 4 inches diameter\r\nand 6 feet long, and was worked by two or four men. The large press\r\nhad a screw 8 1/4 inches diameter, and 12 feet long.\r\n\r\nBoth screws worked in deep gun-metal nuts and had capstan-heads. When\r\nthe large press was near the end of its travel the capstan bars\r\nwere manned by forty coolies putting out their utmost strength and\r\nshouting to encourage each other as they tramped round on the upper\r\nfloor keeping step.\r\n\r\nThe turn out was about 250 bales from daylight to dark. Each bale\r\nweighed 2 piculs, say 280 lbs., or eight to the English ton. The\r\nbales should measure 10 cubic feet, that is a density of 28 lbs. per\r\ncubic foot. The hemp could be pressed into a smaller volume, but it\r\nis asserted that the fibre would be seriously damaged. Sometimes from\r\ncareless pressing the bales measure 12 cubic feet. They swell after\r\nleaving the press and after being moved.\r\n\r\nAt the date I have mentioned, the charge for screwage was 50 cents\r\nper picul, but it has been raised since then.\r\n\r\nDry sugar was exported in its original bags, and loading and shipping\r\ncost 121/2 cents per picul. Wet sugar usually required repacking for\r\nexport, and the charge for discharging the coaster and rebagging was\r\n171/2 cents per picul, as well as 121/2 cents for loading and shipping.\r\n\r\nIt lost 21/2 per cent. in weight in repacking and 10 per cent. during\r\nthe voyage in sailing vessel to Europe or America. So that altogether\r\none-eighth of the total was lost to the shipper, and there was a\r\ngood perquisite to the skipper or mate in pumping the molasses out\r\nof the bilges.\r\n\r\nThe repacking was usually done by natives, and the old mat bags\r\nscraped by women who receive half the sugar they save. The mats are\r\nsold to the distillers and are thrown into their fermenting vats,\r\nto assist in the manufacture of pure Glenlivat or Bourbon whisky,\r\nJamaica rum or Hollands gin.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 I saw on board a steamer just arrived from Antwerp hundreds\r\nof cases containing empty gin bottles packed in juniper husk, the\r\nlabels and capsules bearing the marks of genuine Hollands.\r\n\r\nThey were consigned to one of the Manila distillers, and must have\r\nenabled that respectable firm to make a large profit by selling their\r\ncheap spirit as imported liquor.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the manufactures and industries of the Philippines are in\r\na primitive condition, but the tax called the Contribucion Industrial\r\nhas discouraged improvements, for as soon as any improved machinery\r\nor apparatus was adopted, the tax-gatherer came down upon the works\r\nfor an increased tax. Thus any sort of works employing a steam-engine\r\nwould be charged at a higher rate. This tax, if it cannot be abolished,\r\nshould be reformed.\r\n\r\nThere is a great future before the manufactures of the Philippines,\r\nfor the people are industrious, exceptionally intelligent, painstaking\r\nand of an artistic temperament, so that an ample supply of labour is\r\nalways available for any light work if reasonably remunerated. They\r\nwill not need much teaching, and only require tactful treatment to\r\nmake most satisfactory operatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROSPECTS.\r\n\r\n    Philippines not a poor man's country--Oscar F. Williams' letter--No\r\n    occupation for white mechanics--American merchants unsuccessful\r\n    in the East--Difficulties of living amongst Malays--Inevitable\r\n    quarrels--Unsuitable climate--The Mali-mali or Sakit-latah--The\r\n    Traspaso de hambre--Chiflados--Wreck of the nervous system--Effects\r\n    of abuse of alcohol--Capital the necessity--Banks--Advances to\r\n    cultivators--To timber cutters--To gold miners--Central sugar\r\n    factories--Paper-mills--Rice-mills--Cotton-mills--Saw-mills--Coasting\r\n    steamers--Railway from Manila to Batangas--From Siniloan to the\r\n    Pacific--Survey for ship canal--Bishop Gainzas' project--Tramways\r\n    for Luzon and Panay--Small steamers for Mindanao--Chief prospect\r\n    is agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commercial prospects of the Islands are great, even if we do not\r\ninstantly take for gospel the fairy tales we are told about Manila\r\nbecoming the centre of the trade of the Pacific. There can be no\r\ndoubt that if peace and an honest administration can be secured,\r\ncapital will be attracted and considerable increase in the export of\r\nhemp, tobacco, and sugar will gradually take place as fresh land can\r\nbe cleared and planted. As I have elsewhere said, the Philippines\r\nin energetic and skilful hands will soon yield up the store of gold\r\nwhich the poor Spaniards have been so mercilessly abused for leaving\r\nbehind them. But the Philippines are not and never will be a country\r\nfor the poor white man.\r\n\r\nA white man cannot labour there without great danger to his health. He\r\ncannot compete with the native or Chinese mechanic, in fact he is not\r\nwanted there at all. For my part, I would never employ a white man\r\nthere as a labourer or mechanic, if I could help it, more especially\r\nan Englishman or an American, for I know from experience what the\r\nresult would be. As foreman or overseer a white man may be better,\r\naccording to his skill and character.\r\n\r\nNow let me, as soon as possible, expose the absurdity of a mischievous\r\nletter, which I fear may already have done much harm, but I hope my\r\nwarning may do something to counteract its effects. I quote from the\r\nBlue Book so often mentioned: pp. 330-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Williams to Mr. Day.\r\n\r\nU. S. S. Baltimore, Manila Bay,\r\nJuly 2nd, 1898.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nIf long occupation or possession on the part of our government\r\nbe considered, I believe early and strenuous efforts should be\r\nmade to bring here from the United States men and women of many\r\noccupations--mechanics, teachers, ministers, ship-builders, merchants,\r\nelectricians, plumbers, druggists, doctors, dentists, carriage and\r\nharness makers, stenographers, type-writers, photographers, tailors,\r\nblacksmiths, and agents for exporting, and to introduce American\r\nproducts natural and artificial of many classes. To all such I pledge\r\nevery aid, and now is the time to start. Good government will be\r\neasier the greater the influx of Americans.\r\n\r\nMy despatches have referred to our present percentage of export\r\ntrade. If now our exports come here as intestate, duty free, we have\r\npractical control of Philippine trade, which now amounts to many\r\nmillions, and because of ingrafting of American energy and methods\r\nupon the fabulous natural and productive wealth of these islands,\r\ncan and probably will be multiplied by twenty during the coming\r\ntwenty years. All this increment should come to our nation and not\r\ngo to any other.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nI hope for an influx this year of 10,000 ambitious Americans, and\r\nall can live well, become enriched....\r\n\r\n\r\n(Signed) O. F. Williams,\r\nConsul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI venture to say that the man who wrote this astonishing letter,\r\ntaking upon himself the responsibility of advising \"early and strenuous\r\nefforts\" to send from the United States thousands of men and women\r\nof many occupations to Manila, and of assuring them that \"all could\r\nlive well and become enriched,\" knew nothing at all about the state\r\nof the Philippine Islands, and is a most unsafe guide.\r\n\r\nWhat on earth would all these tradespeople find to do in the\r\nIslands? Where could they be housed? How could they be supported? If\r\nthey came in numbers, the doctors and druggists might indeed find\r\nfull employment prescribing and making up medicine for the many\r\nsufferers from tropical ailments, especially the typhoid fevers,\r\nthat would attack the unacclimatised immigrants and the ministers\r\ncould earn their daily bread by reading the Burial Service, whilst\r\nthe type-writers would be busy typing letters to friends at home\r\nannouncing the deaths that occurred; and warning them against\r\ncoming to starve in Manila. But I defy any one to explain how the\r\nship-builders, electricians, plumbers, tailors and blacksmiths are\r\nto make a living. As regards merchants or agents for exporting,\r\nI may say that Americans have not been very successful in Manila in\r\nthis capacity. The great and influential firm of Russell & Sturgis\r\ncame to grief through over-trading, and another noteworthy firm,\r\nMessrs. Peele, Hubbell & Co. failed from rash speculations in sugar,\r\nand not from any persecutions by the Spanish authorities, as has been\r\nfalsely stated in a magazine article. I speak with knowledge on the\r\nmatter, as I was well acquainted with this firm, having been their\r\nConsulting Engineer for the construction of the Slipway at Canacao for\r\nwhich they were agents. I think it only right to say that the gentlemen\r\nwho were heads of these American firms were worthy upholders of the\r\nhigh reputation of their country. They failed, but no imputations\r\nrested on the characters of the partners, and I have always heard\r\nthem spoken of with great respect, especially amongst the natives.\r\n\r\nThose of them who were personally known to me were men who invariably\r\nshowed every courtesy and consideration to all who came in contact with\r\nthem, whether Europeans or natives. Notwithstanding their misfortunes\r\nthey were a credit to their country, and they did a good deal towards\r\nthe development of the trade of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nI believe that the estates of Russell & Sturgis when realised,\r\npaid all their liabilities in full, and besides left considerable\r\npickings in the hands of the liquidators and their friends. Two or\r\nthree firms were built up out of their ruins. Some Chinese half-castes\r\nand natives had received heavy advances from this firm, especially\r\nabout Molo and Yloilo. One well-known individual had received $60,000,\r\nand when summoned before the court he claimed the benefit of the 'Laws\r\nof the Indies,' by which his liability was limited to $5. The judge,\r\nhowever, ordered him to repay the principal at the rate of a dollar\r\na month! I had this information from the judge himself.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, American merchants have been equally unsuccessful\r\nin other parts of the Far East. Many will remember the failure of\r\nMessrs. Oliphant & Co., the great China merchants, agents for the\r\nAmerican Board of Missions, [16] notwithstanding their desperate effort\r\nto retrieve their position by reviving the coolie trade with Peru, and\r\nin later days Messrs. Russell & Co. of Hong Kong also came to grief.\r\n\r\nI can give no explanation of the reasons for these four great failures,\r\nbut I conjecture that all these firms were in too much of a hurry,\r\nand tried to \"hustle the East.\" Yet in face of this calamitous\r\nexperience, Oscar F. Williams advises more to come, \"pledges every\r\naid,\" and predicts that \"trade can, and probably will, be multiplied\r\nby twenty during the coming twenty years.\"\r\n\r\nFor my part, I should think it great progress if the exports and\r\nimports of the Philippines could be doubled in twenty years. The\r\nidea of sending plumbers to Manila where lead pipes are not used,\r\nis a comicality only matched by the suggestion that tailors are\r\nwanted amongst a population dressed in cotton shirts and trousers,\r\nand where the white people wear veranda-made white duck suits.\r\n\r\nBoth notions are more suitable for a comic opera than for an official\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nThere is only one more paragraph in this letter that I need comment on.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams says: \"Good government will be easier, the greater the\r\ninflux of Americans.\"\r\n\r\nTo those who know the East there is no necessity to argue on this\r\npoint. I therefore state dogmatically that the presence of white\r\nsettlers or working people in the Islands would add enormously to\r\nthe difficulties of government. This is my experience, and during\r\nthe Spanish Administration it was generally admitted to be the case.\r\n\r\nIn British India the Government does not in the least degree favour the\r\nimmigration of British workmen. The only people who are recognised as\r\nuseful to that country are capitalists and directors of Agricultural\r\nor Industrial enterprises.\r\n\r\nA large number of American mechanics turned loose amongst the\r\npopulation would infallibly, by their contempt for native customs,\r\nand their disregard of native feeling, become an everlasting source\r\nof strife and vexation. Impartial justice between the parties would\r\nbe unattainable; the whites would not submit to be judged by a native\r\nmagistrate, and the result would be a war of races.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as probable that there is no crime, however heinous,\r\nthat could be committed by an American upon a native, that would\r\ninvolve the execution of the death penalty on the criminal. [17] On\r\nthe other hand, I can quite believe that natives laying their hands\r\nupon Americans, whatever the provocation, would be promptly hanged,\r\nif they were not shot down upon the spot. The natives, it should\r\nbe remembered, are revengeful, and will bide their time; either to\r\nuse the bolo upon one who has offended them, to burn down his house,\r\nset fire to his crop, or put a crow-bar in amongst his machinery. I\r\nfear that American brusqueness and impatience would often lead to\r\nthese savage reprisals.\r\n\r\nI think, therefore, that the American Administration of the Philippines\r\nshould be empowered to prevent or regulate the immigration of\r\nimpecunious Americans or Europeans whose presence in the Islands\r\nmust be extremely prejudicial to the much-desired pacification. No,\r\nthe poor white is not wanted in the Islands, he would be a curse, and\r\na residence there would be a curse to him. He would decay morally,\r\nmentally, and physically. The gorgeous East not only deteriorates\r\nthe liver, but where a white man lives long amongst natives, he\r\nsuffers a gradual but complete break-up of the nervous system. This\r\npeculiarity manifests itself amongst the natives of the Far East\r\nin the curious nervous disorder which is called mali-mali in the\r\nPhilippines and sakit-latah amongst the Malays of the Peninsula and\r\nJava. It seems to be a weakening of the will, and on being startled,\r\nthe sufferer entirely loses self-control and imitates the movements\r\nof any person who attracts his attention. It is more prevalent amongst\r\nwomen than men. I remember being at a performance of Chiarini's Circus\r\nin Manila, when General Weyler and his wife were present. The clown\r\nwalked into the ring on his hands, and a skinny old woman amongst the\r\nspectators who suffered from the mali-mali at once began to imitate\r\nhim with unpleasing results, and had to be forcibly restrained by\r\nthe scandalised bystanders.\r\n\r\nRunning amok marks a climax of nerve disturbance, when the sufferer,\r\ninstead of committing suicide, prefers to die killing others.\r\n\r\nHe usually obtains his wish, and is killed without compunction,\r\nlike a mad dog.\r\n\r\nBoth natives and white residents are at times in rather a low\r\ncondition of health, and if after exercise or labour they fail to get\r\ntheir meal at the proper time, when it comes they cannot eat. In its\r\nlighter form this is called desgana or loss of appetite, but I have\r\nseen natives collapse under such circumstances with severe headache\r\nand chills. This more serious form is known as traspaso de hambre,\r\nand is sometimes the precursor of fever and nervous prostration.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church has had the wisdom to recognise and make\r\nallowance for the liability of residents and natives of the Philippines\r\nto this serious disorder, and has relaxed the usual rules of fasting,\r\nas being dangerous to health.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Europeans who have been long in the Islands, many are\r\nsaid to be \"chiflado,\" a term I can only render into English by the\r\nslang word cracked. This occurs more particularly amongst those who\r\nhave been isolated amongst the natives.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to account for, but the fact is undeniable. I have\r\nheard it ascribed to \"telluric influence,\" but that is a wide and\r\nvague expression. Perhaps the explanation may be found in the extreme\r\nviolence of the phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nThe frequent earthquakes, the almost continuous vibration of the soil,\r\nthe awe-inspiring volcanic eruptions, with their sooty black palls of\r\nash darkening the sky for days together, over hundreds of miles, the\r\nfrightful detonations, [18] the ear-splitting thunder, the devastating\r\nrage of the typhoons, the saturated atmosphere of the rainy season,\r\nand the hot dry winds of Lent, with the inevitable conflagrations,\r\ncombine with depressing surroundings and anxieties to wreck the nerves\r\nof all but the strongest and most determined natures. If to all this\r\nthe white resident or sojourner in the Philippines adds the detestable\r\nvice of intemperance, or even indulges in a liberal consumption of\r\nspirits, then instead of merely shattering his nerves, he is likely\r\nto become a raving maniac, for it takes much less whisky to bring on\r\ndelirium tremens there, than it does in a temperate climate.\r\n\r\nLong sojourn in some other lands appears to act in a different\r\nmanner. In tropical Africa it seems to be the moral balance that\r\nis lost. The conscience is blunted if not destroyed, the veneer of\r\ncivilisation is stripped off, the white man reverts to savagery. The\r\nsenseless cruelties of Peters, Lothaire, Voulet, Chanoine, and of\r\nsome of the outlying officials of the Congo Free State are not mere\r\ncoincidences. They must be ascribed to one common cause, and that is\r\ndebasement by environment. The moral nature of a white man seems to\r\nbecome contaminated by long isolation amongst savages as surely as\r\nthe physical health by living amongst lepers.\r\n\r\nIf a poor white man wishes to sink to the level of a native, he has\r\nonly to marry a native woman, and his object will be fully attained in\r\na few years. But he will find it very much to his pecuniary interest,\r\nfor she will buy cheaper and sell dearer than he can, and will\r\nmanage his house and his business too, most economically. Some of her\r\nrelations will come and live with him, so that he will not feel lonely,\r\nand a half-caste family will grow up round about him, talking the\r\ndialect of their mother, which he, perhaps, does not understand. But if\r\nthe poor white man takes out a white wife, he will probably have the\r\npain and distress of seeing her fade away under the severity of the\r\nclimate, which his means do not permit him to alleviate. White women\r\nsuffer from the heat far more than men. Children cannot be properly\r\nbrought up there after the age of twelve. They must either be sent\r\nhome to be educated, or allowed to deteriorate and grow up inferior\r\nto their parents in health, strength, and moral fibre. When I think\r\nof these things, I feel amazed at Oscar F. Williams' presumption\r\nin writing that letter. I hope that not many have taken his advice,\r\nand that any who have will call on him to fulfil his imprudent pledges.\r\n\r\nHowever, now I have done with the poor white man. Capital is the\r\ngreat necessity of the Philippines. The labour is there if Generals\r\nOtis and McArthur have left any natives alive.\r\n\r\nMore banks are wanted. At present there are three important banks in\r\nManila, and two of them have branches in Yloilo. The Hong Kong and\r\nShanghai Banking Corporation has the largest resources; next comes the\r\nChartered Bank of India, Australasia, and China, and lastly the Banco\r\nEspanol Filipino. The first two give the most perfect facilities for\r\nbusiness. I was only interested in importing, but certainly nothing\r\nmore could be desired by an importer than their system of opening\r\ncredits against shipping documents; for practically he only had to\r\npay for the goods when they arrived in Manila. All their business\r\nwas done in the most expeditious manner, and I could suggest no\r\nimprovement on their methods.\r\n\r\nThe Banco Espanol Filipino was in a measure under government control,\r\nits procedure was consequently very slow, and its ways those of\r\nbygone days.\r\n\r\nThese banks, however, did not advance money to cultivators to clear\r\nlands, plant crops, or erect machinery, as the returns are too slow,\r\nnot to say doubtful. Yet this is what is wanted; banks in Manila\r\nand the chief towns that will advance money for such purposes, under\r\nthe advice of experts personally acquainted with the cultivators and\r\ntheir lands. Such a business certainly requires great intelligence\r\nand discernment.\r\n\r\nStill there is a future for such banks, for agriculturists have to\r\npay enormous rates of interest and commissions for money to carry\r\non their plantations. Such banks could also finance timber-cutters,\r\ngold miners, and other bona fide workers.\r\n\r\nAmongst the enterprises I have recommended when writing about\r\nthe Pampangos, and others engaged in planting sugar-cane, is the\r\nestablishment of central sugar factories in suitable localities. Such\r\nundertakings, judiciously administered, would have every prospect\r\nof success.\r\n\r\nThere is also room for paper-mills, rice-mills, cotton-mills,\r\nand saw-mills, but all these, especially the last, need careful\r\nconsideration for the selection of the locality where they are to be\r\nplaced. The manufacture of various kinds of leather could be greatly\r\nextended and improved. There is employment for more coasting steamers\r\nand schooners. The latter and hulls of small steamers can be built\r\nin the country from the native timber.\r\n\r\nAlthough the development of means of communication is all-important,\r\nit is evident from the configuration of the Archipelago that no great\r\nlength of railway is required, nor would it pay to construct them\r\nin so mountainous a country. Water-carriage is all-important. In\r\nLuzon a line of railway might be made from Manila to Batangas with\r\na branch into the Laguna province. It would traverse a fertile and\r\nthickly-populated country.\r\n\r\nA short line of railway or electric tramway from near Siniloan on\r\nthe Lake to the Pacific would be most useful in giving access to and\r\ndeveloping the eastern coast, or contra costa, as it is called. This\r\ncoast is very backward in every way, indeed from Baler to Punta\r\nEscarpada on its extreme north, it is quite unknown, and remains in the\r\npossession of the Dumagas, an aboriginal tribe of heathen savages of\r\nlow type, just as at the time of the Spanish conquest; and it would be\r\nworth while to study the question of cutting a ship-canal through this\r\nnarrow strip of land if the mouth could be protected from the Pacific\r\nsurf. There is also Bishop Gainza's project that might be revived, that\r\nof cutting a canal for country craft from Pasacao in Camarines Sur to\r\nthe River Vicol. In Negros and Panay some short lines from the ports\r\nthrough the sugar lands might pay if constructed very economically.\r\n\r\nTramways between populous towns not far apart in Luzon and Panay\r\nwould probably pay very well, as the people are fond of visiting\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be many years before Mindanao will be in a position\r\nto warrant the construction of railways. The island has relapsed into\r\nbarbarism as a consequence of the withdrawal of the Spanish garrisons\r\nand detachments, and of nearly all the Jesuit missionaries.\r\n\r\nIt could, however, give employment to a flotilla of small steamers\r\nand sailing vessels on its northern and southern coasts.\r\n\r\nSuch is my opinion in brief upon the possibilities of the development\r\nof industries and commerce.\r\n\r\nThat the commerce of the islands, now mainly British, will ultimately\r\npass into American hands, can scarcely be doubted. They are not yet\r\nfirmly seated in power, but their attitude to British and foreign firms\r\nis already sufficiently pronounced to allow an observant onlooker to\r\nmake a forecast of what it will be later on.\r\n\r\nDominating Cuba, holding the Philippines, the Sandwich Islands and\r\nPorto Rico, the Americans will control the cane sugar trade, the\r\ntobacco trade, and the hemp trade, in addition to the vast branches\r\nof production they now hold in their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nLIFE IN MANILA.\r\n\r\n(A CHAPTER FOR THE LADIES.)\r\n\r\n    Climate--Seasons--Terrible Month of May--Hot\r\n    winds--Longing for rain--Burst of the monsoon--The\r\n    Alimoom--Never sleep on the ground floor--Dress--Manila\r\n    houses--Furniture--Mosquitoes--Baths--Gogo--Servants--Wages\r\n    in 1892--The Maestro cook--The guild\r\n    of cooks--The Mayordomo--Household budget,\r\n    1892--Diet--Drinks--Ponies--Carriage a necessity for a lady--The\r\n    garden--Flowers--Shops--Pedlars--Amusements--Necessity of access\r\n    to the hills--Good Friday in Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClimate.\r\n\r\nThe average shade temperature of Manila all the year round is 83 deg.\r\nFahrenheit. The highest I have ever seen there was 96 deg., at 2 P.M. in\r\nMay, and the lowest 68 deg., at 6 A.M. in December.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the sea-water on the shore at Malate is usually\r\n82 deg., and that of well-water about the same. The water-pipes from the\r\nreservoir at San Juan del Monte are not buried, but are carried on an\r\nembankment. They are partly shaded from the sun by clumps of bamboos,\r\nbut on a hot afternoon the water sometimes attains a temperature\r\nof 90 deg.\r\n\r\nThose figures are high, yet the heat is mitigated by the sea-breeze,\r\nand the nights are usually cool enough to allow a refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Manila is not harmful to the constitutions of healthy\r\nEuropeans or Americans between twenty and fifty years of age, provided\r\nthey at once adopt a mode of life suitable to the country, and in\r\nclothing, diet, habits and recreations, adapt themselves to the new\r\nconditions. On the other hand, I apprehend that, for persons of either\r\nsex over fifty who have had no previous experience of life in the\r\ntropics, there will be great difficulty in acclimatising themselves,\r\nand the mortality amongst such will be abnormal. Ladies' complexions\r\nwill not suffer more than if they lived in a steam-heated house in\r\nHarlem, New York.\r\n\r\nIn all this part of the world the weather depends upon the\r\nmonsoons. These blow with great regularity over the ocean, six months\r\nfrom the north-east and six months from the south-west. Their action\r\non any particular place is, however, modified by the situation of\r\nmountains with regard to that place. The changes of the monsoon occur\r\nin April--May and October--November. It is the south-west monsoon\r\nthat brings rain to Manila, and it has a fine stretch of the China\r\nSea to career over, all the way, in fact, from the shores of Sumatra,\r\ntill it drives the billows tumbling and foaming into the bay.\r\n\r\nThe typhoons form far out in the Pacific near the region of the Western\r\nCarolines, and, whirling round the opposite way to the hands of a\r\nwatch, they proceed on a curve that may strike Luzon, or, perhaps,\r\ngo on for a thousand miles or more, and carry death and destruction\r\nto the fishermen of Fo Kien or Japan.\r\n\r\nWhen a typhoon passes clear, the usual result is several days of\r\ncontinuous heavy rain, but the air is cleared and purified. But should\r\nthe vortex of the cyclone pass over your residence, you will not be\r\nlikely to forget it for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nThe year in Manila may be roughly divided into three seasons:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rainy Season--June, July, August, September. In these four months\r\n    about 100 inches of rain may fall, and 20 more in the rest of\r\n    the year.\r\n    Cool Season (so-called)--October, November, December, January.\r\n    Hot Season--February, March, April, May.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay is the terrible month of the year, the month of fevers and\r\nfunerals. Let all who can, leave Manila before this month arrives.\r\n\r\nHot, dry winds, dust-laden, pervade the houses, and have such an\r\neffect even on well-seasoned hardwoods, that tables, wardrobes and\r\ndoor-panels, split from end to end, or from top to bottom, with a\r\nnoise like a pistol-shot, leaving cracks a quarter of an inch wide\r\nthat gape till the rainy season restores the moisture.\r\n\r\nAt this time the heat is at its maximum, and all nature gasps or\r\nfades. Not a drop of rain has fallen for months, the roads are inches\r\ndeep in dust, the rivers nearly stagnant, and covered with a green\r\nscum, the whole country quite brown, the vegetation burnt up by the\r\nsun. Only the cockroaches rejoice; at this season they fly at night,\r\nand you may have a few fine specimens of the Blatta Orientalis alight\r\non your face, or on the back of your neck, should you doze a moment\r\non your long chair. Personally, I am proof against a good deal, but\r\nmust confess that the hairy feet of a cockroach on my face or neck\r\nmake me shudder.\r\n\r\nAs the month draws to a close, every afternoon the storm-clouds\r\ngather over the Antipolo Hills. All Manila, lying in the glare and\r\ndust, prays for rain. Overhead, a sky like burnished copper darts\r\ndown heat-rays that penetrate the roofs, and literally strike the\r\nheads of the occupants. The dry air is surcharged with electricity to\r\nsuch an extent that every living thing feels the powerful influence;\r\nthe sweetest natures become irritable, and quite ready to admit that\r\n\"this is, indeed, a beastly world.\"\r\n\r\nThe nervous system suffers, the newspapers relate cases of stabbing,\r\nor even running amok amongst the natives, and perhaps some suicides\r\noccur. If, as not unfrequently happens, you should at this time\r\nreceive an invitation to the funeral of a friend or compatriot just\r\ndeceased from typhoid fever, and to be buried within twenty-four\r\nhours, you will begin to wonder whether Manila is good enough for\r\nyou. Day after day the rain-clouds disperse amidst the rumbling of\r\na distant thunder-storm, and day after day do longing eyes watch for\r\ntheir coming, and hope for the cloud-burst.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the limit of endurance seems reached, a cool breath of\r\nair heralds the downpour. The leaves rustle, the feathery bamboos\r\nincline before the blast, the sky darkens, the cataracts of heaven\r\nare loosed, and the water tumbles down in torrents.\r\n\r\nNow keep yourself in the house, and on the upper floor, and let the\r\nwater from your roofs run to waste. The natives, usually so careless of\r\na wetting, avoid bathing or wetting themselves with the first waters,\r\nwhich they consider dangerous, and not without reason. The exhalations\r\nfrom the newly-wetted earth are to be avoided; these earth-vapours are\r\ncalled by the Tagals Alimoom. Now the dust is washed off the roofs and\r\nleaves, and in three days the fallows are covered with small shoots\r\nof grass or weeds, the maidenhair ferns and mosses spring from every\r\nstone wall. The reign of dust is over; the reign of mud begins. Now the\r\nfrogs inaugurate their nightly concerts. After a time you get used to\r\nthe deafening noise; you do not even hear it. But they suddenly stop,\r\nand you are astonished at the stillness.\r\n\r\nAs the rainy season proceeds, the air is almost entirely saturated\r\nwith moisture: the saturation in August sometimes exceeds 97 per cent.\r\n\r\nNow green mould will grow upon your boots and other leather articles,\r\nif left a couple of days without cleaning. Everything feels damp,\r\nand it is a good plan to air your wardrobe round a brazier of red-hot\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\nYou will have noticed that the natives universally build their houses\r\nupon piles. So do the Malays all over the Far East. This is the\r\nexpression of the accumulated experience of centuries, and you will\r\nbe wise to conform to it by never sleeping on the ground floor. To\r\na dweller in the Philippines this tip is worth the price of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDress.\r\n\r\nThe dress of both sexes should be as light as possible; my advice is,\r\nwear as little as possible, and wear it thin and loose. The access\r\nof air to the body is necessary to carry off the perspiration, some\r\nof which is in the form of vapour.\r\n\r\nLadies will find the greatest comfort in the simple but elegant\r\ndresses called batas, which are princess robes made of embroidered\r\ncambric or lawn. The materials for these dresses can be purchased in\r\nManila, and excellent sempstresses and embroiderers can be hired at\r\nmoderate wages, and the dresses made in the house. For the evenings,\r\nthin silk or muslin dresses, cut low, are most suitable.\r\n\r\nMen who are young and robust should wear white duck jackets,\r\nand trousers without waistcoats. Elderly men, or those subject to\r\nrheumatism, will do well to wear thin flannel suits. The material\r\nfor these can be got in Hong Kong. For travelling and shooting,\r\nunbleached linen, guingon, or rayadillo, is the best material,\r\nmade into Norfolk jackets and pantaloons. I always found white or\r\nbrown leather shoes the best wear, and canvas shooting-boots capped\r\nand strapped with leather. A Panama hat, or a solar topee, is the\r\nbest head-wear. If one has to be much in the sun, a white umbrella,\r\nlined with green, should be carried. Dress is not an expensive item\r\nin Manila. Up to 1892, the washing for a whole family, with bed and\r\ntable-linen, could be done for $12 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouses.\r\n\r\nMost of the older houses in Manila are of ample size, and well suited\r\nto the climate, but some of the newer ones, built to the designs\r\nof a Spanish architect, and having glass windows, are very hot and\r\nuncomfortable. It is essential to live in a good-sized house, so\r\nas to escape the heat by moving to a different part as the sun goes\r\nround. Thus you will have your early breakfast in one corner of the\r\nbalcony; your tiffin, perhaps, on the ground floor; your tea in the\r\nopen corridor looking on the garden, and your dinner, at 7.30 P.M.,\r\nin the dining-room under the punkah.\r\n\r\nHouse-rent is paid monthly, and, up to 1892, a good detached house of\r\nmoderate size could be got in one of the best suburbs for $100 per\r\nmonth, and for less in Santa Ana. Such a house would stand in its\r\nown garden, and would have stables for several horses, and shelter\r\nfor one or two carriages.\r\n\r\nI understand that house-rent is now nearly doubled in consequence\r\nof the American competition. From their lavish expenditure, we must\r\ninfer that the new-comers possess large private means in addition to\r\ntheir salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurniture.\r\n\r\nThe furnishing of a tropical house is much simplified, because no\r\ncarpets or curtains are needed. The floors are of polished hardwood,\r\nand they take a good deal of work to keep them in good order. A\r\nfew rugs can be put down here and there, if a little colour is\r\nrequired. Where the floor is bad, Chinese matting can be laid down at\r\nsmall expense. Some of the Mestizos import costly furniture, but few\r\nof the European residents attempted to follow their example. Vienna\r\nbent-wood furniture, with cane seats, was commonly used, and was very\r\nsuitable, also bamboo or rattan furniture, brought from China or made\r\nin the country. Such things as wardrobes or bookcases should have\r\nring-bolts on each side for lashing to the walls. A child or grown\r\nperson might be killed by a heavy piece of furniture falling on it\r\nduring an earthquake.\r\n\r\nFurniture of all sorts is made in Manila of Red Narra, or other\r\nwood, by Chinese cabinet-makers, who will work to purchasers'\r\nrequirements. Very excellent teak-wood furniture is made in Hong Kong\r\nand Shanghai.\r\n\r\nThe problem of furnishing a large house for a moderate sum, and making\r\nit comfortable, and at the same time artistic and refined, is not a\r\ndifficult one, and has often been very satisfactorily solved in Manila.\r\n\r\nLarge stoneware flower-pots and pedestals can be purchased in Manila,\r\nand no more suitable ornament can be found than handsome palms, ferns,\r\nor flowering plants, for halls, corridors, or reception rooms.\r\n\r\nThe beds should be large, and have thin, hard mattresses and horse-hair\r\npillows stuffed rather hard. The coolest thing to lie upon is a fine\r\ngrass mat, or petate. Covering is seldom required. On the bed will\r\nbe seen a large bolster lying at right angles to the pillows, so as\r\nto be parallel to the sleeper. The use of this is not apparent to\r\nthe newly-arrived Briton or American. This is the Abrazador, used\r\nthroughout the boundless East.\r\n\r\nThe candidate for repose, whether on the hard bed, or harder floor\r\nor deck, lies on his side, and rests his upper arm and leg on the\r\nAbrazador, thus relieving his hip and shoulder from much of his\r\nweight. He takes care to keep it a little way off his body to allow\r\nthe air to circulate.\r\n\r\nA mosquito-net must be fitted to every bed, but may not always be\r\nrequired. In the sleeping-room there should be no curtains, and\r\nthe least possible amount of furniture, and, during the hot season,\r\nthe bed should stand in the middle of the room. It is advisable to\r\nhave no light in the bedroom, but good lights are a necessity in\r\nthe dressing-rooms.\r\n\r\nBy being careful about this you will keep your bedroom free from\r\nmosquitoes. Petroleum is commonly used in the Philippines for lighting,\r\nand unless the lamps are of the best quality, and carefully trimmed,\r\nthere is considerable danger of accident. I used to keep some plants\r\nin pots in each room so as to throw the earth over any oil that might\r\nget alight. Whenever there was a shock of earthquake, I extinguished\r\nthe petroleum lamps, and lighted candles instead. And whenever we went\r\nout to a dinner or dance, every petroleum lamp was extinguished, and\r\ncocoanut-oil lights or candles substituted in case of an earthquake\r\nwhilst we were out.\r\n\r\nFrequent baths are indispensable to good health in Manila. Enormous\r\nearthenware tubs, made in China, can be procured. These are placed\r\nin the bath-room, and filled in the evening, so that the water gets\r\nrefreshingly cool during the night. It is not at all advisable to get\r\ninto the water, as the effect is not so good as dashing the water over\r\nthe head with a small bucket called a tabo. By using the water thus,\r\nand rubbing the skin briskly with a towel, a reaction soon sets in,\r\nand the bather feels quite invigorated.\r\n\r\nA bath of this kind when rising, and another before dressing for\r\ndinner, will do much to mitigate the rigour of the climate.\r\n\r\nFrom several stories told me by friends recently returned from Manila,\r\nit would seem that the Americans there, or some of them, at least,\r\nare not sufficiently alive to the necessity of daily baths, but I\r\nrefrain from giving particulars.\r\n\r\nThis seems strange when one remembers the profusion with which baths\r\nare provided in all the modern hotels in the great cities of America.\r\n\r\nNow I must tell you about gogo. This is the dried bark of a creeper\r\nthat grows wild in the woods, and it is the finest thing possible to\r\nkeep your hair in order.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of this plant, the three most commonly used\r\nare gogo bayugo (Entada scandens Benth.); gogong casay (Peltophorum\r\nferrugineum Benth.); gogong paltaning (Albizzia saponaria Blum.).\r\n\r\nAs washing the hair with gogo is one of the luxuries of the\r\nPhilippines, I shall describe how it is done.\r\n\r\nA servant pounds a piece of the stem and bark, and steeps it in a\r\nbasin, twisting and wringing it occasionally until the soluble part\r\nhas been extracted. He then adds to the liquor two or three limes,\r\nsqueezing the juice out, and soaking the peel. He also throws in\r\na handful of crushed citron-leaves, and strains the liquor through\r\nmuslin.\r\n\r\nThe servant then ladles this over your head with a calabash, or\r\ncocoa-nut shell, whilst you rub your hair with your hands.\r\n\r\nAs the liquor is strongly alkaline, you must be careful to keep\r\nyour eyes closed until the head has been rinsed with water. Your\r\nhair-wash is made fresh whenever you want it, and may cost from two\r\nto three pence.\r\n\r\nThe fragrance of the citron-leaves is delicious, and when you have\r\nrinsed and dried your hair, you will find it as soft, as bright, and as\r\nsweet-smelling as the costliest perfumes of Bond Street could make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nServants.\r\n\r\nIn the good old times we were well off for servants in Manila. They\r\nflocked up from the provinces seeking places, and those employers\r\nwho took pains to enquire closely into the antecedents of applicants,\r\ncould almost ensure being well served.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen paid good wages, and paid punctually, hence they could\r\ncommand the best servants.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I may say that I kept my servants for years--some nearly\r\nthe whole time I was in the islands. I had very little trouble with\r\nany of them. There are people who say that they have no feeling,\r\nbut I remember that when I embarked with my family on leaving Manila,\r\nmy servants, on taking leave at the wharf, were convulsed with tears\r\nat our departure.\r\n\r\nA family living comfortably in a good-sized house would require the\r\nfollowing servants:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     Wages in 1892.\r\n                                                     Dollars.\r\n\r\n    Mayordomo, or steward, who would act as butler    8 per month.\r\n    Two houseboys, one would valet the master, the\r\n    other would trim lamps and pull the punkah, @ $6 12 per month.\r\n    Sempstress or maid to mistress                    6 per month.\r\n    Gardener or coolie, would carry water for\r\n    baths, sweep and water                            6 per month.\r\n    Coachman, would look after one pair of horses\r\n    and carriage                                     12 per month.\r\n    Food for six servants, @ $3 each                 18 per month.\r\n    Maestro cook                                     18 per month.\r\n                                                     --\r\n                                                     80\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican competition for servants has more than doubled these rates\r\nof pay. Cooks get $50 now.\r\n\r\nThe house-boys and maid live in the house, and sleep on the floor,\r\nwith a grass mat and pillows. The mayordomo sometimes lives quite\r\nnear, being, perhaps, a married man. The coachman has his room by\r\nthe stables, and the gardener lives in the lodge, or in a small hut\r\nin the garden.\r\n\r\nThe maestro-cook does not usually sleep on the premises. He\r\narrives about 11 A.M., bearing two baskets depending from a pinga,\r\nor palma-brava staff, resting on his shoulder. These baskets will\r\ncontain the day's marketing--eggs, fish, meat, chicken, salad,\r\ntomatoes, bananas, firewood, and many other things.\r\n\r\nHe promptly sets to work, and by twelve, or half-past, presents a\r\ntiffin of three or four courses.\r\n\r\nHis afternoon is devoted to preparing the more elaborate dinner due\r\nat 7.30 P.M., when he will be ready to serve soup, fish, entrees,\r\na roast, a curry, and sweets, all conscientiously prepared, and sent\r\nin hot. Most excellent curries are made in Manila, both by Chinamen\r\nand natives. To my mind, the best are made from prawns, from crab,\r\nor from frogs' legs. If you cannot eat anything else at dinner,\r\nyou can always make out with the curry.\r\n\r\nThe dinner over, the cook asks for orders, and takes his departure,\r\nto return with perfect punctuality the following day.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese cooks all belong to a guild, which is a trades' union\r\nand a co-operative society, and are bound to follow the rules.\r\n\r\nThey would never dream of going into a market and bidding one against\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nTheir system is to assemble early every morning at the guild house,\r\nand for each man to state his requirements. A scribe then tabulates the\r\norders--so many turkeys, so many chickens, etc., and two experienced\r\ncooks are commissioned as buyers to go into the market and purchase\r\nthe whole lot, the provisions being afterwards fairly divided amongst\r\nthe members, each having his turn to get the choice pieces, such as\r\nsaddle of mutton, kidneys, etc. But if a dinner-party is contemplated,\r\nthe cook who has to prepare it gets the preference.\r\n\r\nThey thus obtain everything much cheaper than the native cooks, even\r\nafter taking a good squeeze for themselves. I believe that they have\r\na fixed percentage which they charge, and would consider it dishonest\r\nto take any more, whilst the guild would not approve of their taking\r\nany less.\r\n\r\nIf you send away your cook, the guild will settle for you who is\r\nto replace him. All your culinary fancies will be well known to the\r\ncouncil of the guild, and they will pick out a man up to your standard.\r\n\r\nIt was customary to give the cook a fixed sum per day to provide\r\ntiffin and dinner, and this was paid once a week.\r\n\r\nI found that two dollars a day was sufficient to amply provide for my\r\nfamily, and I could have one guest to tiffin or dinner without notice,\r\nand be confident that the meal would be sufficient. In fact, this was\r\npart of my agreement with the cook. By giving short notice, the dinner\r\ncould be extended for two or three people at an additional charge.\r\n\r\nThe cook rendered no account of the money he received; but, if I\r\nwas not satisfied with the meals he provided, I admonished him,\r\nand if he did not do better I discharged him. I may say, however,\r\nthat there was very seldom cause for complaint, for the Chinese are\r\nthorough business men.\r\n\r\nWhen a dinner-party was given, the cook provided according to order,\r\nand sent in his bill for the extras. There was no housekeeping, and\r\nno need to order anything, and you knew exactly how much you were\r\nspending weekly, and how much a dinner-party cost.\r\n\r\nThe cleaning and polishing your plate and glass, the laying the\r\ntable, the tasteful adorning of it with variegated leaves, with\r\nferns or flowers, and the artistic folding of the serviettes, may\r\nwith confidence be left to the mayordomo's care; every detail will\r\nbe attended to down to the ylang-ylang flowers in the finger-bowls.\r\n\r\nWith such servants as these, the mistress of the house, free from\r\ndomestic cares, may take her shower-bath, and, clad in Kabaya\r\nand Sarong, await the moment when she must resume the garments of\r\ncivilisation, and receive her guests looking as fresh, in spite of\r\nthe thermometer, as if she had stepped out of a coupe in Piccadilly\r\nor Fifth Avenue. Ladies used to the ministry of Irish Biddy or Aunt\r\nChloe ought to fancy themselves transported to heaven when they find\r\nthemselves at the head of a household in Manila.\r\n\r\nI append a note of household expenses for a family living moderately\r\nin Manila in 1892. I suppose the cost has been doubled under American\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHousehold Budget in 1892.\r\n\r\nFor a family of three adults and three children.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    Mexican Dollars.\r\n\r\nHouse-rent                                          per month   100\r\nServants' wages and food                            per month    80\r\nWashing                                             per month    12\r\nForage and grain for two ponies                     per month    16\r\nAllowance to cook for market                        per month    60\r\nExtra for two dinner-parties of six or eight\r\nguests each                                                      20\r\nBill at Almacen (grocery store) for groceries,\r\nordinary wines, spirits, and petroleum              per month    65\r\nBill at Botica (drug store) for soda water, ice\r\nand various articles                                per month    20\r\nCase of champagne for dinner-parties                per month    25\r\nRepairs to carriage, shoeing horses, materials\r\nfor cleaning stable, etc.                           per month    10\r\nGarden expenses--plants, tools, hose                per month     5\r\nSubscriptions to clubs, telephone, newspapers,\r\nand charities                                       per month    20\r\nTobacco and cigars                                  per month     7\r\nTaxes on servants and horses                        per month    10\r\nClothing for self and family                        per month    50\r\nPocket money, entertainments, and sundries          per month   100\r\n                                                               -----\r\n                                                    Per month   600\r\n\r\n                                               Say $7,200 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiet.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of Boston readers (if I should be lucky enough to\r\nhave any in that learned city), I may say that pork and beans is not\r\na suitable diet for a tropical country. I should also forbid the \"New\r\nEngland dinner,\" and roast goose, or sucking pig, stewed terrapin,\r\nand pumpkin pie. A light diet of eggs or the excellent fish to be had\r\nin Manila, chickens fattened on maize, beef or mutton, once a day,\r\nand rice, vegetables and salad, with plenty of ripe fruit, according\r\nto the season, is desirable. The fare can be diversified by oysters,\r\nprawns, crabs, wild duck, snipe, and quail, all of which are cheap\r\nand very good in the season. There are no pheasants in Luzon, but\r\nthe jungle cock (labuyao) is as good or better.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics a good table is a necessity, for the appetite needs\r\ntempting. Such a diet as I have mentioned will keep you in health,\r\nespecially if you are careful not to eat too much, but to eat of the\r\nbest. If you economise on your table you will have to spend the money\r\nat the drug-store. Taboo pork, because--well, when you have been a\r\nweek or two in the country you will not need to ask why--Moses and\r\nMahomet knew what they were about.\r\n\r\nMy remarks about drinks are intended for the men, as ladies do not\r\nneed any advice on this subject. In a tropical climate it is necessary\r\nto be very careful in the use of spirits.\r\n\r\nHaving lived for more than twenty-five years in the tropics, and\r\nhaving kept my health remarkably well, I feel warranted in giving my\r\nexperience. I have made surveys, or directed works, in many climates,\r\nexposed to all weathers, and I know that the very worst thing a man\r\ncan take, if he has to work or march in the sun, is spirits. There is\r\nnothing that will predispose him to sunstroke as much as spirits. For\r\nmarching, walking, or shooting, in the sun, I know nothing like cold\r\ntea without milk or sugar. It should be poured off the leaves after\r\ninfusing for two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach shelter you can take a lemon squash or a cagelada--this\r\nis the juice of cageles (a kind of orange) with sugar and water--which\r\nis a most cooling drink. Never take spirits to buck you up to your\r\nwork. Whatever spirits you drink, let it be after sunset. I am a\r\nbeliever in drinking wine at meals; it makes me shudder to see people\r\ndrinking tea, lemonade, or milk, with their dinners, and laying up\r\nfor themselves torments from dyspepsia, for which they have to swallow\r\npills by the boxful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPonies.\r\n\r\nThere is a race of ponies in the islands that is descended from Spanish\r\nand Arab horses, and owing to an absolutely haphazard breeding, the\r\nsize has diminished, although the symmetry has been preserved. Those\r\nfrom Ilocos are the smallest, but they are the hardiest and most\r\nspirited.\r\n\r\nA pair of ponies and a Victoria is an absolute necessity for a lady\r\nin Manila, and I have little doubt that an American judge would\r\ndeclare the \"failure to provide\" to be cruelty and grant a divorce\r\nif applied for.\r\n\r\nBoth harness and carriages are made in the city, but imported harness\r\ncan be had, better finished, at double the price.\r\n\r\nIn my time a fine pair of ponies could be bought for $200 to $300;\r\na new Victoria for $500, and harness for $60. The cost of keeping a\r\npair of ponies was $16 per month, and a coachman $12 per month, food,\r\nand livery. What the cost is now I have no information.\r\n\r\nThe public carriages were not fit for a lady to use, though sometimes a\r\nsuitable one could be hired by the week or month from a livery stable.\r\n\r\nThe ponies are wonderfully strong and sure-footed. I weigh over 200\r\nlbs., yet some of these ponies have carried me about all day over\r\nrough ground without stumbling. They carry a lady beautifully, and\r\nriding is the best form of exercise a lady can take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Garden.\r\n\r\nThe garden will be a great source of occupation to the mistress of\r\nthe house. If it is sheltered from the wind and supplied with water,\r\nshe can grow almost anything. And plants will come up quickly, too,\r\nunder the influence of the heat and moisture.\r\n\r\nThere are nursery gardens at Pasay, where all sorts of plants and\r\nseedlings can be obtained; in fact, these are hawked about morning\r\nand evening.\r\n\r\nThe so-called gardener rarely has much skill, but he will clean up\r\nthe garden and water it, and do what he is told.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and delicate ferns can be grown, and\r\nmagnificent orchids got to flower, if they are well sheltered in\r\na mat-shed. Bananas and pines grow without trouble, and radishes,\r\nsalads, tomatoes, cucumbers, and melons, can be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShops.\r\n\r\nYou can get most things you want in Manila. The drug-stores are mostly\r\nin German hands, but there is one English one where the usual English\r\narticles can be got.\r\n\r\nThere is an ample supply of wines, spirits, and preserved provisions\r\nat the grocers, and the drapers keep on hand any quantity of silks,\r\nmuslins, and piece-goods, with all the necessary fixings. French and\r\nGerman shoes are in plenty.\r\n\r\nThe goods in the jewellers' shops and in the fancy bazaars are all of\r\na very florid style, to suit the gaudy taste of the wealthy Filipinos.\r\n\r\nSuch piece-goods and haberdashery as are in common use are brought\r\nround to the ladies at their own houses by Chinese hawkers, who,\r\nhaving small expenses, sell remarkably cheap.\r\n\r\nThey are always very civil and attentive, and will gladly get you\r\nany article that they have not in stock at the moment.\r\n\r\nLadies save going about in the heat and dust by purchasing from\r\nthese men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmusements.\r\n\r\nThe amusements for ladies were limited to riding, lawn-tennis, boating,\r\npicnics, and frequent dances. I remember many delightful dances\r\nin Manila. One was given to the officers of the U.S.S. Brooklyn,\r\nand another to the U.S.S. Richmond. At the latter, the ladies were\r\nin traje del pais, i.e., dressed as natives and mestizas. And very\r\nhandsome some of them looked. Now and again some theatrical company\r\nwould come over, mostly from Saigon. There were a good many dinner\r\nparties given amongst the British community, and weekly receptions\r\nat most of the principal houses, during the time I lived in Manila,\r\nwhere you could get a little game of cards, dance, flirt, or take it\r\neasy, just as you liked.\r\n\r\nThe ladies very wisely took a rest from two to four, to be fresh for\r\nthe evening. The proper hour for calling was at 9 P.M. or 10 A.M. on\r\nSundays after High Mass.\r\n\r\nI knew several ladies, English and American, who look back upon a\r\nterm of years spent in Manila as the happiest in their lives.\r\n\r\nChildren born in Manila can remain there without damage to their\r\nhealth till ten or twelve years old, and after having spent a few\r\nyears at home are indistinguishable from children born and brought\r\nup in England.\r\n\r\nThe principal thing lacking in Manila is means of access to the hills\r\nwhere people could go occasionally for a change and during the hot\r\nseason. I have little doubt that the Americans will provide this\r\nbefore long.\r\n\r\nManila was not without its frivolous element; but there was one\r\nperiod of the year when all frivolities were suspended, and religious\r\nobservances monopolised the people's time. That was in Lent, and the\r\nceremonies culminated on Good Friday.\r\n\r\nThe Very Noble and always Loyal City of Manila celebrates the\r\ngreatest day of the Christian year very devoutly. On foot, and robed\r\nin black, its inhabitants high and low throng the churches and attend\r\nthe procession.\r\n\r\nAll shops are closed, vehicular traffic is suspended, the ensigns\r\nhang at half-mast, the yards of ships are crossed in saltire; not a\r\nsound is heard.\r\n\r\nThe capital and the whole of the civilised Philippines mark the\r\ncrucifixion of our Saviour by two days of devotion, of solemn\r\ncalm. Under Spanish rule a stately procession, attended by the highest\r\nand the humblest, filed slowly through the silent streets, the Civil\r\nGovernment, the Law, the Army, the Navy, the Municipality and the\r\nReligious Orders, being represented by deputations in full dress,\r\nwho followed bare-headed the emblems of the faith in the presence of\r\nan immense crowd of natives, who bent the knee and bowed the head in\r\nhomage to the crucified Saviour.\r\n\r\nI never failed to witness this imposing spectacle when in Manila,\r\nand it was mortifying to me to remember that Good Friday in London\r\nis nothing but a vulgar holiday, and that probably not one person out\r\nof a hundred in its vast population realises in the least degree the\r\nevent that solemn fast is intended to commemorate.\r\n\r\nThe death-like stillness of Good Friday remained unbroken till High\r\nMass was over on Saturday morning, when the cathedral bells rang out\r\na joyous peal, soon taken up by the bells of the numerous churches\r\nin the city and all over the provinces.\r\n\r\nThe ensigns were run up to the staff or peak, the yards were squared,\r\nand royal salutes thundered out over land and sea, whilst clouds of\r\nwhite smoke enveloped the moss-grown ramparts of the saluting battery,\r\nand the useless, lumbering masts and spars of the flagship. Then\r\nsteam-whistles and sirens commenced their hideous din, the great doors\r\nof the houses were thrown open, and hundreds of bare-backed ponies,\r\nwith half-naked grooms, issued at full gallop to the sea or river.\r\n\r\nThen Manila resumed its every-day life till the next Holy Thursday\r\ncame round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSPORT.\r\n\r\n(A CHAPTER FOR MEN.)\r\n\r\n    The Jockey Club--Training--The races--An archbishop\r\n    presiding--The Totalisator or Pari Mutuel--The Manila\r\n    Club--Boating club--Rifle clubs--Shooting--Snipe--Wild\r\n    duck--Plover--Quail--Pigeons--Tabon--Labuyao, or jungle\r\n    cock--Pheasants--Deer--Wild pig--No sport in fishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nManila was not so badly off for sport as might be thought. The\r\npony-races, conducted under the auspices of the Jockey Club, excited\r\nthe greatest interest amongst all classes.\r\n\r\nThe ponies underwent their training at the race-course in Santa Mesa,\r\nand their owners and other members of the club were provided with\r\nearly breakfast there. The native grooms took as much interest in\r\nthe success of the pony they attended as the owner, and they backed\r\ntheir favourite for all they were worth.\r\n\r\nOnly members were allowed to ride, and the weights were remarkably\r\nheavy for such small ponies. When the races came off, business was\r\nalmost suspended for three days, and all Manila appeared at the\r\nrace-course. There were sometimes two thousand vehicles and immense\r\ncrowds on foot.\r\n\r\nThe ladies in their most resplendent toilettes were received by the\r\nstewards, presented with elegantly-bound programmes, and conducted\r\nto their places on the grand stand.\r\n\r\nPresently a military band would strike up the \"Marcha Real,\" as the\r\nGovernor-General's equipage entered the enclosure, and that exalted\r\npersonage, dressed in black frock coat and silk hat, white trousers\r\nand waistcoat, with the crimson silk sash of a general, just peeping\r\nfrom under his waistcoat, was conducted to his box, followed by his\r\nsuite and the favoured persons invited to join his party.\r\n\r\nThe highest authority in the country presided and handed the prizes to\r\nthe winning jockeys, who were brought up to him by the vice-president\r\nof the club. But on an occasion when the Governor-General and Segundo\r\nCabo were absent, I witnessed the races which were presided over\r\nby no less a personage than His Grace the Archbishop of Manila,\r\nFray Pedro Payo, in his archiepiscopal garments, and smoking a big\r\nHavana cigar. The old gentleman enjoyed the sport and most graciously\r\npresented the handsome prizes to the winners.\r\n\r\nBetting was conducted by the totalisator, or pari-mutuel, the bet\r\nbeing five dollars, repeated as often as you liked. As I presume my\r\nreaders understand this system, I shall not describe it. The natives\r\nbet amongst themselves to a considerable amount.\r\n\r\nPavilions were erected by different clubs or bodies, and a\r\nprofuse hospitality characterised each day. Winners of large\r\nsilver cups usually filled them with champagne and passed them\r\nround. Bets were made with the ladies as an excuse for giving them\r\npresents. Dinner-parties were given in the evenings at private houses,\r\nand there were dinners at the clubs. There were two race-meetings in\r\nthe year. No doubt this sport, temporarily interrupted by insurrection\r\nand war, will again flourish when tranquillity prevails.\r\n\r\nThere was a boating-club in connection with the British Club at\r\nNagtajan, now removed to Ermita, and some very good skiffs and boats\r\nwere available. There was a regatta and illuminated procession of\r\nboats each year.\r\n\r\nPolo clubs and rifle clubs had a rather precarious existence,\r\nexcept that the Swiss Rifle Club was well kept up, and there were\r\nsome excellent shots in it. There was a lawn tennis club, which had\r\nladies and gentlemen as members, and some very good games were played\r\nthere and valuable prizes given.\r\n\r\nShooting was a favourite sport with many Englishmen and a few mestizos.\r\n\r\nExcellent snipe-shooting is to be had in all the paddy-fields around\r\nManila and the lake. But at San Pedro on the Pasig, there is a wide\r\nexpanse of rough ground with clumps of bushes, and it was here that\r\nthe most exciting sport was to be had, and it took some shooting\r\nto get the birds as they flew across the openings between the\r\nbushes. Snipe-shooting began in September, when the paddy was high\r\nenough to give cover, and lasted to the end of November. The birds,\r\nwhen they first arrived, were thin, but they soon put on flesh, and\r\nby November were fat and in splendid condition for the table. There\r\nis no better bird to be eaten anywhere than a Manila snipe. Bags of\r\neighty were sometimes made in a morning by two guns.\r\n\r\nExcellent wild-duck and teal-shooting was to be got on and around\r\nthe lake and on the Pinag de Candaba, and wherever there was a sheet\r\nof water. When crossing the lake I have seen wild fowl resting on the\r\nsurface in such enormous numbers that they looked like sandbanks. They\r\nare not easy to approach, but I have killed some by firing a rifle\r\ninto the flock. The crested-lapwing and the golden-plover are in\r\nplenty, and on the seashores widgeon and curlew abound. Inland, on\r\nthe stubbles, there are plenty of quail. Pigeons of all sorts, sizes,\r\nand colours, abound at all times, especially when the dap-dap tree\r\nopens its large crimson blossoms. Some kinds of brush-turkeys, such\r\nas the tabon, a bird (Megapodius cuningi) the size of a partridge,\r\nthat lays an egg as large as a goose egg and buries it in a mound of\r\ngravel by the shore, are found.\r\n\r\nThe labuyao, or jungle cock, is rare and not easy to shoot in a\r\nsportsmanlike way, although a poacher could easily shoot them on a\r\nmoonlight night.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern Islands some remarkable pheasants of most brilliant\r\nplumage are to be found, and whilst in Palawan I obtained two good\r\nspecimens of the pavito real (Polyplectron Napoleonis), a very handsome\r\ngame bird with two sharp spurs on each leg. They are rather larger\r\nthan a partridge, but their fan-shaped tails have two rows of eyes\r\nlike a peacock's tail, there being four eyes in each feather.\r\n\r\nDeer and wild-pig abound, and can be shot within four hours' journey of\r\nManila by road. Round about Montalban is a good place for them. They\r\nare plentiful at Jala-jala, on the lake at Porac in Pampanga, and\r\nround about the Puerto Jamelo and Pico de Loro, at the mouth of Manila\r\nBay. In fact, they are found wherever there is cover and pasture for\r\nthem. The season is from December to April.\r\n\r\nThe usual way is to go with a party of five or six guns and employ\r\nsome thirty native beaters, each bringing one or two dogs.\r\n\r\nThe guns are stationed in suitable spots and the beaters and their\r\ndogs, fetching a compass, extend their line and drive the game up to\r\nthe guns. This is rather an expensive amusement, as you have to pay\r\nand feed the beaters and their dogs; but it is very good sport, and\r\nin proceeding and returning to camp from two beats in the morning and\r\ntwo in the afternoon, you got quite as much exercise as you want or as\r\nis good for you. The venison and wild-pig is very good eating, but it\r\nis difficult to get it to Manila fresh, whatever precautions you take.\r\n\r\nTaken all round, Luzon is well supplied with game, and may be\r\nconsidered satisfactory from a sportsman's point of view.\r\n\r\nThere is no sport to be had in fishing; in Luzon, so far as I know,\r\nthere are no game fish. When living on the banks of the Rio Grande,\r\nnear Macabebe, I noticed some natives taking fish at night by placing\r\na torch on the bow of a canoe, which was paddled by one man slowly\r\nalong near the bank, another man standing in the bow with a fish-spear\r\nof three prongs, similar to the \"grains\" used in England. As the fish\r\ncame up to the light he struck at them with his spear and managed to\r\npick up a good many.\r\n\r\nThis appeared good sport, and I arranged for a native to come for me\r\nin a canoe with torch, and I borrowed a spear. We started off, but\r\nthere was some difficulty in standing up in a small, narrow canoe,\r\nand darting the spear. My first stroke was a miss, the fish escaped;\r\nmy second, however, was all right, and I shook my catch off the spear\r\ninto the canoe, but the native shouted out, \"Masamang ahas po!\" (a\r\npoisonous snake, sir) not forgetting to be polite even in that\r\nsomewhat urgent situation. The snake was wriggling towards me, but\r\nI promptly picked him up again on the spear and threw him overboard,\r\nmuch to my own relief and that of the Pampanga.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those black and yellow water-snakes, reputed as\r\npoisonous. That was enough fishing for me, and I remembered that I had\r\na particular appointment at home, and left fishing to professionals.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, fish cannot be taken by the trawl, for a mestizo\r\ngot out a trawling steamer with gear, and men to handle it, and after\r\nrepeated trials in different places, had to give it up as a bad job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nBRIEF GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION OF LUZON.\r\n\r\n    Irregular shape--Harbours--Bays--Mountain ranges--Blank\r\n    spaces on maps--North-east coast unexplored--River and\r\n    valley of Cagayan--Central valley from Bay of Lingayen\r\n    to Bay of Manila--Rivers Agno, Chico, Grande--The Pinag of\r\n    Candaba--Project for draining--River Pasig--Laguna de Bay--Lake\r\n    of Taal--Scene of a cataclysm--Collapse of a volcanic cone 8000\r\n    feet high--Black and frowning island of Mindoro--Worcester's pluck\r\n    and endurance--Placers of Camarines--River Bicol--The wondrous\r\n    purple cone of Mayon--Luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Luzon is of so irregular a shape that it cannot be\r\nintelligibly described without the aid of a map.\r\n\r\nThat part of it to the north and west of the isthmus of Tayabas lies\r\nwith its longitudinal axis due north and south, and has a fairly\r\neven coast line, there being only two great indentations, the Bays of\r\nLingayen and Manila, both on the west coast. There are also on that\r\nside and to the south the smaller bays of Subic, Balayan, Batangas,\r\nand Tayabas.\r\n\r\nOn the east coast of this northern part are the unimportant bays of\r\nPalanan, Dilasac, Casiguran and Baler, besides the great bay of Lamon,\r\nsheltered by the islands Calbalete and Alabat.\r\n\r\nBut in the remainder of Luzon, from the isthmus of Tayabas eastward\r\nand southward, the coast line is most irregular, and the width much\r\nreduced. A chain of mountains commencing at and forming the two\r\nabove-mentioned islands and running in a south-easterly direction\r\nforms the peninsula of Tayabas.\r\n\r\nAnother range, starting near the Bay of Sogod, runs a little south of\r\neast as far as Mount Labo (1552 metres), turns south-east, and runs\r\nalong the southern shore of the fertile valley of the River Vicol,\r\nand with many a break and twist and turn reaches Mount Bulusan, whose\r\nslopes run down to the waters of the Strait of San Bernardino. The\r\nconvolutions of this range form on the south the secure harbour of\r\nSorsogon, and on the north the bays of Albay, Tabaco, Lagonoy and\r\nSogod, besides a multitude of smaller ports and bays, for the coast\r\nline is wonderfully broken up by spurs of the main ranges running out\r\ninto the sea. Luzon generally is very mountainous, and more especially\r\nso that part lying to the north of 16 deg. 5', where the great ranges\r\nof mountains run in crooked lines but with general north and south\r\ndirection. The range running parallel to the Pacific coast is called,\r\nin its most southern part, the Caraballos de Baler, and the rest of\r\nit, up to Punta Escarpada, is known as the Cordillera del Este, or\r\nthe Sierra Madre. The central range, starting from Mount Caraballo in\r\nthe latitude before mentioned, is called the Cordillera Central for\r\nabout a degree of latitude, and from there is known as the Cordillera\r\ndel Norte, terminating at Punta Lacatacay, in longitude 121 deg. east\r\nof Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThe mountains on the western coast are not so lofty, nor do they form\r\na connected range. They are known as the Sierras de Ilocos. Some of\r\nthese ranges are thirty or forty miles long. There are cuts in places\r\nwhere rivers find an outlet to the sea, such as the Rio Grande de\r\nLaoag, the Rio Abra, and some lesser streams. All these ranges have\r\nspurs or buttresses. Those of the Central Cordillera extend as far,\r\nand join with, the coast range on the west, covering the whole country\r\nand leaving no large plain anywhere, for the valley of the Abra though\r\nlong is very narrow. There is a little flat land about Vigan.\r\n\r\nBut the eastern spurs of the central range, in the part of Luzon under\r\nconsideration, do not interlace with the spurs of Sierra Madre, but\r\nleave a magnificent valley more than two degrees of latitude in length\r\nand varying breadth. This is the only great valley of northern Luzon,\r\nand through it runs the Rio Grande de Cagayan and its tributaries,\r\nthe Magat and the Rio Chico, with numerous minor streams.\r\n\r\nCoasting steamers with about twelve feet draught cross the bar of\r\nthe Rio Grande and lie at Aparri. The river is navigable in the dry\r\nseason as far as Alcala for light draught steamers. Alligators abound\r\nin these rivers. In this valley, which extends through the provinces\r\nof Cagayan and Isabela up into Nueva Vizcaya, there is to be found a\r\ngreat extension of rich alluvial soil on which can be raised, besides\r\nother tropical crops, most excellent tobacco, the cultivation of\r\nwhich was for many years obligatory upon the inhabitants, who were\r\nforbidden to grow rice.\r\n\r\nLittle has been done in the way of making a trigonometrical survey of\r\nthe Highlands of Luzon, but some military reconnaissance sketches have\r\nbeen made from time to time by staff or engineer officers employed in\r\nbuilding forts, and from these several maps have been compiled. One of\r\nthe most complete of these is by that intrepid explorer and painstaking\r\ngeographer, D'Almonte. Another map has been published by Colonel\r\nOlleros. It must be admitted that these maps do not agree with each\r\nother, but that is not unusual in maps of the Philippines, and results\r\nfrom a custom of the Spanish engineers of doing too much in the office\r\nand not enough in the field. Colonel Olleros has, however, on his map\r\nshown the lesser known mountain ranges very vaguely, and has left more\r\nthan a thousand square miles of territory quite blank. This tract lies\r\nbetween the central range and the Cagayan River, and is inhabited by\r\nthe Apayaos, Calingas, Aripas, and Nabayuganes. Olleros also leaves\r\nsome large blanks on the east coast, and he is quite right to do so,\r\nfor this coast has hardly been visited since Salcedo sailed past it at\r\nthe time of the Conquest, and nothing is known about that part of the\r\nisland which remains to this day in possession of the savage Dumagas,\r\na Negrito tribe. That coast is almost entirely destitute of shelter,\r\nand is exposed to the full force of the Pacific surf. It is made more\r\ndangerous by tidal waves which are formed either by distant cyclones\r\nor by submarine upheavals and occur without warning.\r\n\r\nThe largest and richest valley in Luzon is that which extends without\r\na break from the shores of the Bay of Lingayen to the Bay of Manila,\r\nhaving an area of some 3000 square miles, and comprising the best\r\npart of the Provinces of Pangasinan, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga,\r\nBulacan and Manila.\r\n\r\nThe town of Tarlac is situated about half-way between the two bays,\r\nand approximately marks the watershed. About half-way between Tarlac\r\nand the northern shores of Manila Bay there rises from the plain an\r\nisolated mountain of volcanic origin, Mount Arayat. The crater has been\r\nsplit through and the mountain thus shows two peaks. It is covered with\r\nforest to the very summit. Arayat was thrown up within historic times,\r\nand the Indians have a tradition that it was completed in one night,\r\nwhich is a most unlikely story.\r\n\r\nMount Arayat is 2880 feet in height, and in fine weather is plainly\r\nvisible from Manila and Cavite, and even from the mouth of the bay.\r\n\r\nThe principal rivers of this valley are the Agno, the Dagupan, the\r\nRio Grande and the Rio Chico of Pampanga.\r\n\r\nThe Agno rises in the mountains of Lepanto, runs south through the\r\nprovince of Benguet, and S.W., W. and N.W. in Pangasinan into a\r\nlabyrinth of creeks communicating by many mouths with the Bay of\r\nLingayen. The river between Dagupan and San Isidro is navigable\r\nfor vessels drawing seven or eight feet, and such craft could reach\r\nSalasa. From there to Rosales only lighters of very small draught\r\ncould pass, and after a long spell of dry weather rice-boats drawing\r\nonly one foot sometimes run aground. Its principal tributaries are\r\nthe Tarlac and the Camiling, with dozens of smaller streams bringing\r\nthe whole drainage of the eastern slopes of the Zambales mountains\r\nfrom Mount Iba to San Isidro.\r\n\r\nThe Dagupan river rises in the mountains about the limits of Union and\r\nBenguet and runs parallel to the Agno to 16 deg. N. lat., and between it\r\nand the sea. Then it turns to the westward, and runs past the towns\r\nof Urdaneta, Sta, Barbara, and Calasiao, entering the Bay of Lingayen\r\nat Dagupan. It has a multitude of small tributaries which are very\r\ndifferently shown on D'Almonte's and Olleros' maps, and undoubtedly\r\nthis part has never been surveyed.\r\n\r\nThe Pampanga river has its source on the southern slopes of the\r\nCaraballo, in about 16 deg. 10' N. lat. It runs south in two branches,\r\nthe Rio Grande and the Rio Chico; the first, being the easternmost,\r\nreceives the drainage from the western slopes of the Cordillera del\r\nEste, whilst the Chico receives tributaries from both sides in the\r\nflat country and also the overflow from the Lake of Canarem.\r\n\r\nThese two branches unite just north of Mount Arayat, and continue in\r\na southerly direction. The river is navigable for small craft drawing\r\nthree feet as far as Candaba in the dry season, and in the rainy\r\nseason as far as San Isidro in Nueva Ecija. When in flood during\r\nthe rainy season, this river brings down a large body of water and\r\nannually overflows its banks in certain places, where gaps occur. The\r\nescaping water spreads itself over a low plain forming an inundation\r\nsome sixteen miles long and several miles wide, called the Pinag de\r\nCandaba. This remains during the rainy season, and when the level\r\nof the Rio Grande has fallen sufficiently, the water of the Pinag\r\ncommences to fall also, and during the middle and latter part of the\r\ndry season, and the beginning of the rainy season, only patches of\r\nwater remain here and there, which are utilized for breeding fish,\r\nand a crop is raised on the land left dry. A project for draining\r\nthe Pinag and reclaiming the land was many years ago got up by a\r\nSpanish colonel of engineers, and, at the request of an English\r\ncompany, I went up to investigate and report on it. I found that,\r\nirrespective of the difficulties and expense of the proposed works,\r\nthe vested rights of the natives of the many towns and villages in\r\nand around the Pinag rendered it impossible to carry out the scheme.\r\n\r\nVast flocks of wild duck and other water-fowl frequent the Pinag,\r\nand good sport is to be had there. Below the Pinag the river spreads\r\nitself over the low country, forming a labyrinths of creeks mostly\r\nnavigable for craft drawing three to four feet, but the mouths are\r\nall very shallow and the bars can only be crossed about high tide. The\r\nwater is brackish or salt. An immense extent of country is intersected\r\nby these creeks, certainly 200 square miles, and there are said to\r\nbe 120 mouths connecting with the bay. With the exception of two or\r\nthree of the principal channels, this swamp has never been surveyed,\r\nand what is shown on the map is merely guessed at. The muddy soil\r\nis covered with mangrove in the low parts submerged at each tide,\r\nand with the Nipa palm where the banks rise above high water. Under\r\nthe heading Pampangos will be found particulars of the manufacture\r\nof nipa-thatch carried on here, and of collecting and distilling\r\nthe juice. With the exception of a few half-savage natives the only\r\nliving things are wildfowl, fish in abundance, alligators, snakes,\r\nand blue crabs. This is indeed a great dismal swamp, more especially\r\nat low tide.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find one's way in these creeks, and although\r\nI frequently traversed them, I found it necessary to take a swamp\r\nIndian as a guide.\r\n\r\nThe city of Manila is situated astride the River Pasig on a strip\r\nof land between the Bay of Manila and a great sheet of freshwater\r\ncalled the Lake of Bay. In consequence of this situation, Manila\r\ncan communicate by the bay, the lake, the creeks and rivers with the\r\nprovinces of Bataan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Morong, Laguna,\r\nand Cavite. Until the opening of the Manila-Dagupan railroad the\r\nwhole transport of the Archipelago was by water, and the possession\r\nof navigable rivers meant progress and wealth, whilst the absence\r\nof rivers meant stagnation and poverty. Around the city the land is\r\nquite flat, but at about four miles distance there is a sharp rise\r\nto a plateau of volcanic tuff, the surface of which is from sixty to\r\neighty feet above sea level, of which more anon. The River Pasig is\r\nthe overflow from the lake and the outlet for the River San Mateo,\r\nwhich runs into it at right angles. The lake serves as a receiver for\r\nthe great floods that come down the San Mateo valley; for the level of\r\nthat river at Santolan, the intake of the waterworks, sometimes rises\r\nmore than twenty feet. When this occurs, the flood on reaching the\r\nPasig is divided; part runs into the lake, and part into the bay. The\r\ncurrent of the Pasig in that part between the junction of the San\r\nMateo and the outlet from the lake is reversed. Then when the flood\r\nsubsides, the water which has entered the lake runs out very slowly\r\ninto the bay, for the head produced by the greatest flood becomes\r\ninsignificant from being spread over the vast extent of the lake.\r\n\r\nRice, sugar, cocoa-nuts, bamboos, timber, and fruits are the principal\r\nproducts of the province of La Laguna. The inhabitants supply the\r\nManila markets with poultry. The Pasig and the lake are navigated by\r\nlight draught steamers which ply daily to Binan, Calamba, and Santa\r\nCruz. There are also numerous native small craft, which bring down\r\nthe produce. To the south of Manila the province of Cavite slopes\r\ngently up from the shores of the bay and from the lake to the\r\nhigh cliffs at the northern end of the volcanic lake of Taal. The\r\nvalley is intersected by numerous streams all of which run into the\r\nbay. Part of this province, near Manila, is a stony and sandy desert,\r\nbut other parts of it are extremely fertile, and large crops of rice,\r\nwith some coffee, and cacao, and fruits, are raised. The Augustinians\r\nand Dominicans have large estates here, and have expended considerable\r\nsums on dams to retain water for irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe Lake of Bombon, or Taal, has in its centre an island containing\r\nthe remains of the volcano. From the nature of the surrounding\r\ncountry it is conjectured that on the spot now occupied by the lake\r\na volcanic mountain, some 8000 feet high, formerly stood. The great\r\nbed of volcanic tuff already mentioned, extending from thence up to\r\nMeycauayan more than sixty miles distant, is thought to have been\r\nejected from that lofty volcano, leaving a vast hollow cone, which\r\nultimately collapsed, causing a convulsion in the surrounding country\r\nthat must have rivalled the famous cataclysm of Krakatoa. This is\r\nthe opinion of D. Jose Centeno, a mining engineer employed by the\r\nSpanish Government, and was fully confirmed by my learned friend,\r\nthe late Rev. J. E. Tenison-Wood, who carefully examined the locality,\r\nand studied all the records.\r\n\r\nThe province of Batangas is very rich and fertile; it has some\r\nmountains, but also a considerable extension of sloping or flat\r\nland. In beauty it will compare with the best parts of Surrey, such\r\nas the view from Leith Hill, looking south. Sugar and coffee are the\r\nprincipal products, and the towns of Taal, Bauang, Batangas, and Lipa\r\nare amongst the wealthiest of Luzon. The fields are well cultivated,\r\nand oxen are much used, both for ploughing and for drawing carts. The\r\nbeef in this province is excellent.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this beautiful and wealthy province lies the huge island\r\nof Mindoro. Ever black and gloomy does it look, its lofty mountains\r\nalmost perpetually shrouded in rain-clouds. When I lived in Balayan\r\nI had a good view of this island from my windows, and can scarcely\r\nremember its looking otherwise than dark and forbidding. Nothing\r\ncomes from it but timber and jungle produce. There are known to be\r\nsome beds of lignite. Only the coast is known, and the jungle fever\r\nprevents exploration. The island of Marinduque is healthier and more\r\nadvanced. It produces hemp of fine quality.\r\n\r\nThe province of Tayabas is very mountainous, and is still mostly\r\ncovered with forest; there are no wide valleys of alluvial soil. Some\r\nrice is grown, also large quantities of cocoa-nuts, and some coffee\r\nand cacao. Timber and jungle produce form the principal exports. I\r\nhave seen many specimens of minerals from this province and think it\r\nwould be well worth prospecting. But the climate is unhealthy, and\r\ndangerous fevers prevail. This circumstance has been useful to the\r\nSpanish Government, for when a governor or official had made himself\r\ndisliked he could be appointed to Tayabas with a fair prospect of\r\ngetting rid of him either by death or by invaliding in two or three\r\nyears at most.\r\n\r\nCamarines Norte is also mountainous, and there is not much cultivation,\r\nonly a little rice and hemp. The population is very sparse,\r\nand the inhabitants are mostly employed (when they do anything)\r\nin washing for gold at Mambulao, Paracale, and other places on the\r\nPacific coast. If they strike a pocket, or get a nugget, they go on\r\nthe spree till they have spent it all and can get no more credit,\r\nand then unwillingly return to work. Camarines Sur possesses a wide\r\nexpanse of fertile soil in the valley of the River Bicol, in which\r\nare the Lakes of Buhi and Bato, and the Pinag of Baao. The Bicol\r\nrises in the province of Albay and runs through the whole length of\r\nCamarines Sur, generally in a north-westerly direction, running into\r\nthe great Bay of San Miguel. It is navigable for small vessels up\r\nto the town of Nueva Caceres. Alligators abound here. A gap in the\r\ncoast range gives access to this valley from the port of Pasacao. The\r\nground is level for leagues around, yet from this plain two extinct\r\nvolcanoes rear their vast bulk, the Ysarog, 6500 feet high, and\r\nthe Yriga, nearly 4000 feet high. Camarines Sur contains more than\r\nfive times as many inhabitants as Camarines Norte, although not very\r\ndifferent in area. Their principal occupation is the cultivation of\r\nthe extensive rice lands. They also produce some hemp and a little\r\nsugar. Large quantities of rice are exported to Manila, to Albay,\r\nand to Bisayas. Cattle are raised in the island of Burias, which\r\nbelongs to this province; it also produces some palm sugar. This\r\nprovince is much richer than either Tayabas or Camarines Norte.\r\n\r\nThe province of Albay is the southernmost and easternmost part of\r\nLuzon, and is one of the richest and most beautiful regions of that\r\nsplendid island. The northern part, which commences at Punta Gorda\r\non the Bay of Lagonoy, is similar to the neighbouring Camarines Sur,\r\nas is also the western part, about the shores of Lake Bato. A little\r\nto the southward, however, the gigantic Mayon rears its peak 8000\r\nfeet into the sky. The symmetry of this wondrous cone is but feebly\r\nrendered by the photograph. Some of the most violent eruptions of this\r\nremarkable volcano are mentioned under another heading in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nOn this volcanic soil, with the life-giving heat of the sun tempered\r\nby frequent rains, the vegetable kingdom flourishes in the utmost\r\nluxuriance. Tree-ferns, lianas, orchids, palms grow vigorously. On\r\nthe mountain slopes the Musa textilis, or abaca plant, finds its most\r\ncongenial habitat. Little rice is grown, the inhabitants being mostly\r\nengaged in the more remunerative occupation of planting and preparing\r\nthis fibre.\r\n\r\nA description of the manner of its preparation, with photographs\r\nof the growing plants and of the apparatus for cleaning the fibre,\r\nwill be found under the description of the Vicols.\r\n\r\nThe island of Catanduanes belongs to Albay province, and its\r\ncharacteristics and productions are the same. The configuration of\r\nthe province of Albay is most favourable to the production of this\r\nfibre. The plant seems to require a light volcanic soil, a certain\r\nheight above the sea, and exposure to the Pacific breezes in order\r\nto flourish.\r\n\r\nTo summarise the description of Luzon we may say that its agricultural\r\nwealth, present and future, lies in the valley of the Rio Grande\r\nof Cagayan, in the great valley lying between the Gulf of Lingayen\r\nand the shores of the Bay of Manila, in the rich lands of Cavite,\r\nBatangas, and Laguna, in the valley of the River Bicol, and on the\r\nslopes of the volcanoes of Albay.\r\n\r\nThe production of the great northern valley is principally tobacco;\r\nof the middle valley, sugar and rice; of the southern valley, rice,\r\nand of the volcanic slopes, Manila hemp. The Sierras of Ilocos are\r\nhighly mineralised, as are also the mountains of Tayabas, whilst as\r\nalready stated washing for gold is the principal industry of Camarines\r\nNorte. Parts of this great island, as in Bulacan and Pampanga, support\r\na dense population of 500 to the square mile; whilst, in other parts,\r\nhundreds or even thousands of square miles are absolutely unknown,\r\nand are only populated by a few scattered and wandering savages,\r\nmany of whom have never seen a white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INHABITANTS OF THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of their appearance, dress, arms, religion, manners\r\nand customs, and the localities they inhabit, their agriculture,\r\nindustries and pursuits, with suggestions as to how they can be\r\nutilized, commercially and politically. With many unpublished\r\nphotographs of natives, their arms, ornaments, sepulchres, and idols.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nAetas or Negritos, Including Balugas, Dumagas, Mamanuas, and\r\nManguianes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese people are generally considered to be the aborigines of the\r\nPhilippines, and perhaps at one time inhabited the entire group. The\r\ninvasion of the Malays dispossessed them of the littoral, and of\r\nthe principal river valleys, and the Spanish Conquest drove them\r\ngradually back into the mountains. It seems strange that these\r\nirreclaimable savages should be able from their eyries on Mount\r\nMariveles to distinguish a great city with its Royal and Pontifical\r\nUniversity and yet remain unconverted, uncivilised, and independent\r\nof all authority, just as they were before Legaspi arrived.\r\n\r\nThey are a race of negroid dwarfs of a sooty black colour, with\r\nwoolly hair, which they wear short, strong jaws, thick lips, and\r\nbroad flat noses. The men I have seen in the jungle near Porac and at\r\nMariveles were about 4 feet 8 inches in height, and the women about\r\na couple of inches shorter. The men only wore a cord round the waist\r\nwith a cloth passed between their legs. The women wore a piece of\r\ncloth around the hips, and as ornaments some strings of beads round\r\ntheir necks. However, like many other savages in the Philippines and\r\nelsewhere, those of them, both men and women, who are accustomed to\r\ntraffic with the Christian natives, are possessed of clothes which\r\nthey put on whenever they enter a village. Their appearance was not\r\nprepossessing; the skin of a savage is rarely in good order or free\r\nfrom some scaly eruption, and the stomach is commonly unduly distended\r\nfrom devouring large quantities of vegetable food of an innutritious\r\ncharacter. Still they were not so unpleasing as might be supposed,\r\nfor although their figures are not good according to our standards,\r\nnor are their muscles well developed, either on arms or legs,\r\nyet there was a litheness about them that gave promise of extreme\r\nagility and great speed in running. As a matter of fact, they do\r\nrun fast, and climb trees in a surprising way. The Tagals and other\r\nMalays who go barefooted use their toes to pick up an object on the\r\nground rather than stoop as a European would do, but the toes of the\r\nNegritos are more like fingers. They come near the Quadrumanes in\r\nthis respect. The men carried bows, about five feet six inches long\r\nand a quiver full of iron-pointed arrows--also a wood-knife, or bolo,\r\nvery roughly made. The former they make themselves; but the latter\r\nthey obtain from the Tagals. I can confirm from my own experience a\r\nstatement of various travellers, that they are fond of lying close\r\nto fires or in the warm ashes, for when I arrived at a bivouac\r\nof these people near Porac, their skins were covered with ashes,\r\nand I saw that they had recently arisen from their favourite lair,\r\nthe prints of their forms being plainly visible. They had with them\r\nsome wretched starveling dogs which assist them in the chase.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the Negritos must be descended from a race which\r\nformerly extended over a vast area, for remains of them exist in\r\nSouthern India, in the mountains of Ceylon, and in the Andaman Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the Malay Peninsula they are called Semang. From the description\r\nof them given by Hugh Clifford, in his interesting book, 'In\r\nCourt and Kampong,' they appear to be identical with the Philippine\r\nNegritos. Crauford, in his 'History of the Indian Archipelago,' gives\r\nthe measurement of a Negrito from the hills of Kedah as four feet\r\nnine inches. Mr. F. V. Christian, in a paper recently read before\r\nthe Royal Geographical Society, stated that he had found tombs of\r\nNegritos on Ponape one of the Caroline group.\r\n\r\nThe Negritos build no houses, and are nomadic, in the sense of\r\nmoving about within a certain district. They live in groups of\r\ntwenty or thirty under a chief or elder, and take his advice about\r\ncamping and breaking up camp, which they do according to the seasons,\r\nthe ripening of jungle fruit, movements of game, etc. They seem to\r\nhave great reverence for their dead and for their burial-grounds,\r\nand apparently dislike going far away from these places where they\r\nsuppose the souls of their ancestors are wandering. They bury their\r\ndead, placing with them food and weapons for their use, and erect a\r\nrough shelter over the graves.\r\n\r\nIt would be curious to learn the opinion of these poor savages\r\non the proceedings of some learned Teuton, prowling around their\r\ngraveyards in search of skulls and skeletons for the Berlin or Dresden\r\nEthnographical Museum.\r\n\r\nThey have no tribal organisation and even make war on other groups,\r\nseeking victims for the death-vengeance. They are therefore unable\r\nto assemble in large numbers; nor is it easy to see how they could\r\nsubsist if they did so. They put up rough sloping shelters against\r\nthe sun and wind, consisting of a framework of saplings or canes,\r\ncovered with coarse plaited mats of leaves which they carry with them\r\nwhen they move their camp.\r\n\r\nIn Pampanga and Bataan, they are occasionally guilty of cattle\r\nstealing, and even of murdering Christians, if a favourable opportunity\r\npresents itself. In such a case an expedition of the Cuadrilleros of\r\nthe neighbouring towns is sent against them.\r\n\r\nIf they can be found, their bows and arrows are no match for\r\nthe muskets of the Cuadrilleros, and some of them are sure to be\r\nkilled. After a time peace is restored.\r\n\r\nThe trade for jungle produce is too profitable to the Christians for\r\nthem to renounce it, whatever the authorities may order.\r\n\r\nThe Negritos do not cultivate the ground but subsist on jungle fruits\r\nand edible roots, their great luxury is the wild honey which they\r\ngreedily devour, and they barter the wax with the Christians for\r\nrice and sweet potatoes. They also hunt the deer and wild pigs, and\r\nas Blumentritt says, they eat everything that crawls, runs, swims,\r\nor flies, if they can get it. They chew buyo like the Tagals and\r\nother Malays, and are inordinately fond of smoking.\r\n\r\nThey are said to hold the lighted end of their cigars in their mouths,\r\na thing I have seen done by the negroes on the Isthmus of Panama.\r\n\r\nThey appear to have no religion, but are very superstitious. They\r\ncelebrate dances at the time of full moon, the women forming a ring\r\nand the men another ring outside them, something like a figure in the\r\nKitchen Lancers. They move round to the sound of some rude musical\r\ninstruments in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nWhether this performance is intended as a mark of respect to the\r\nmoon, or is merely held at the full for the convenience of the light,\r\nI cannot say.\r\n\r\nSeveral travellers have stated that they sacrifice pigs when\r\nit thunders. As thunder-storms are very frequent and often of\r\nextraordinary violence in the Philippines, this custom would imply the\r\npossession of a large number of pigs on the part of the Negritos. Those\r\nof Mariveles and of the Zambales mountains do not appear to possess\r\nany domestic animals, except dogs, and they find it difficult to\r\nkill the wild pigs, active as they are. Consequently, I think this\r\nmust apply to those Negrito tribes, such as the Balugas and Dumagas,\r\nof whose condition I shall speak later. They are also said to offer\r\nup prayers to the rainbow. This offering can be made with greater\r\nease than the sacrifice of a pig, but the frequency of rainbows at\r\ncertain seasons will keep them pretty closely to their devotions.\r\n\r\nRatzel, 'History of Mankind,' vol. i., p. 471, says: Among the Negritos\r\nof Luzon, a fabulous beast with a horse's head which lives in trees\r\nis venerated under the name of Balendik. And on p. 478: When killing\r\nan animal, the Negritos fling a piece heavenwards crying out at the\r\nsame time, \"This is for thee.\"\r\n\r\nThey show great respect for old age, and the British War Office might\r\nlearn something from them for they are reported to tend with love\r\nand care every old man of warlike repute.\r\n\r\nTheir language largely consists of curious clicks and grunts, and\r\nthose of them who trade with the Christians usually learn enough of\r\nthe local dialect to do the necessary bargaining.\r\n\r\nThere are some varieties of the Negritos who are more or less mixed\r\nup with the Malays, but their origin is not clear.\r\n\r\nThe Malay women are very unprejudiced, perhaps there are no women\r\non earth more ready to form temporary or permanent alliances with\r\nforeigners: they do not disdain even the Chinamen. They perhaps do\r\nnot like them, but they know that John Chinaman makes a good husband,\r\nprovides liberally for his family, and does not expect his wife to\r\ndo any hard work.\r\n\r\nBy some writers the Malay women, notably the Visayas, are accused\r\nof unbounded sensuality (Anto. de Morga. Sucesos de Filipinas),\r\nbut anyhow the Tagal women draw the line at Negritos, and will have\r\nnothing to do with them.\r\n\r\nFray Gaspar de San Agustin however thought that the Visaya women\r\nwould not be so particular.\r\n\r\nThis being so, the hybrid races in Luzon must have sprung from the\r\nunion of Remontados--that is to say, of Malays who took refuge in\r\nthe hills either from a natural love for savage life, or as fugitives\r\nfrom justice--with the Negrito women.\r\n\r\nAmongst these varieties are the Balugas, who live in the eastern\r\ncordillera of Nueva Ecija, in north and south Ilocos, and in the\r\nmountains of Tayabas. Some of these people have advanced a step in\r\ncivilisation, they build huts and do a little rude cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe Dumagas, another hybrid race, occupy the eastern slopes of the\r\nSierra Madre from the northern frontier of El Principe district to the\r\nBay of Palanan, where the last Tagal village is situated, the Tagals\r\nthinly peopling the shores. But from Palanan to Punta Escarpada the\r\nwhole coast is in the undisputed possession of the Dumagas.\r\n\r\nThe Dumagas keep up a friendly communication with the few Christian\r\nvillages near them, and do a small trade with them. They even work on\r\ntheir lands and help in fishing for a small remuneration, generally\r\npaid in cotton cloth.\r\n\r\nThey have no known religion, they marry without ceremony, and are\r\nsaid to disregard the ties of kinship.\r\n\r\nThose who live far from the Christian villages are said to be entirely\r\nbrutal and devoid of all virtue, for they will sell their own children\r\nfor a little rice. They are almost irreclaimable from their savage\r\nand independent character.\r\n\r\nSome of these Dumagas live amongst the Irayas and the Catalanganes,\r\ntwo heathen and semi-independent tribes showing signs of Mongolian\r\nblood, who occupy a considerable stretch of country in the province of\r\nCagayan between the Rio Grande and the Sierra Madre, say about twenty\r\ngeographical miles north and south of the 17th parallel. These Dumagas\r\nintermarry with the tribes they live amongst, and have adopted their\r\ndress, religion, and customs.\r\n\r\nThe Mamanuas, also a hybrid race, inhabit the mountains of the\r\nnorth-east promontory of Mindanao. They are few in number. There were,\r\nin 1887, four Jesuit mission stations amongst them, three of which\r\nare on Lake Mainit, or Sapongan, as it is called on some maps.\r\n\r\nThe Manguianes, who are probably a hybrid Negrito-Visaya race, occupy\r\nalmost the whole interior of Mindoro, up to within two leagues of the\r\ncoast. There are a few in the mountains of Romblon and Tablas. There\r\nare three varieties of these people, those residing near the western\r\ncoast are much whiter, with lighter hair and full beards.\r\n\r\nThose living in the centre of the island are of a darker colour, have\r\nsloping foreheads and less intelligence, while those of the southern\r\npart, by their oblique eyes, aquiline noses and olive colour, show\r\nsigns of Chinese blood.\r\n\r\nThey are docile and do not fly from civilised man. A primitive\r\nagriculture and the collection of jungle produce enables them to\r\nobtain from the Christians, in exchange, rice, knives, bells, gongs,\r\ntobacco, and buyo. They are not much advanced in religion, but are\r\nvery superstitious. They believe that the spirits of their ancestors\r\nand relations never leave the places where they lived, but remain to\r\nprotect their descendants and families. There is noted amongst these\r\npeople a strong sense of morality and honesty, which unfortunately\r\nis not recognised by their Christian neighbours, who are accustomed\r\nto oppress them with the most exaggerated usury.\r\n\r\nSince these words were written, Dean C. Worcester has published his\r\nbook on the Philippines, and amply confirms these remarks. He saw\r\na good deal of the Manguianes, and bears testimony to their honesty\r\nand morality, and adds: \"On the whole, after making somewhat extensive\r\nobservations amongst the Philippine natives, I am inclined to formulate\r\nthe law that their morals improve as the square of the distance from\r\nchurches and other civilising influences.\"\r\n\r\nHe gives some particulars of their laws, and of their ordeals, which\r\nare common to many of the Malays. There are some Manguianes in the\r\nIsland of Palawan. They inhabit the mountains in the interior of\r\nthe southern part of the island, and little is known about them,\r\nfor the pirate races, or Mahometan Malays, who occupy the coasts,\r\nkeep a strict watch to prevent their communicating with outsiders.\r\n\r\nThe few who have been seen by the Spaniards, are said to be\r\nindustrious, and physically similar to the Tagbanuas. Their customs\r\nare said to be influenced by their constant intercourse with the\r\nMahometans. They were thought to number about 4000 in 1887, by Don\r\nFelipe Canga Arguelles, the Governor of the Island. The Moors appear\r\nto oppress the Manguianes of Palawan much as the Christian natives\r\ndo the Manguianes of Mindoro.\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents a Negrito from the Island of Negros, a very\r\nfavourable specimen of his race. He wears the head-dress of a chief,\r\nand is armed with a bow and arrow of portentous length. His figure,\r\nthough not muscular, gives promise of great agility.\r\n\r\nThe Negritos of Palawan are few in number, and resemble those of\r\nMariveles. They use a piece of cloth, made of the inner bark of a\r\ntree as their only garment. They call this the Saligan. They inhabit\r\nthe upper parts of the mountains between Babuyan and Barbacan, say\r\nfrom 10 deg. to 10 deg. 20' N. latitude. They do a little agriculture in a\r\nprimitive fashion. The men clear the land, the men and women together\r\ndo the planting, and the women alone the reaping.\r\n\r\nTheir arms are bows and arrows, and the only education of the young\r\nis in archery, which is taught them by their mothers from their\r\nearliest infancy.\r\n\r\nThey are said to be generous, hospitable, and inoffensive, but\r\nextremely revengeful if they are ill-treated. They have no religion,\r\nbut perform certain ceremonies from time to time. Canga-Arguelles\r\ncomputed them to number about 500 in 1887.\r\n\r\nThe only use the Negritos can be to the United States will be as\r\na subject of study for the elucidation of problems in ethnography,\r\nand to furnish skeletons for the museums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nLuzon and Adjacent Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII.\r\n\r\nTagals (1). [19]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important race in the Archipelago is the Tagal, or Tagalog,\r\ninhabiting Central Luzon, including the following provinces:--\r\n\r\nBatangas, Bulacan, Bataan, Camarines Norte, Cavite, Laguna, Manila,\r\npart of Nueva Ecija and Tayabas, the districts of Infanta, Morong,\r\nand part of Principe, also the Island of Corregidor and the coast\r\nof Mindoro. They probably number about one million five hundred\r\nthousand souls.\r\n\r\nAntonio de Morga, in his work 'Sucesos de Philipinas,' says (p. 126):\r\n\"The women wear the baro and saya, and chains of gold upon their\r\nnecks, also bracelets of the same. All classes are very clean in\r\ntheir persons and clothing, and of good carriage and graceful (de\r\nbuen ayre y gracia\").\r\n\r\nThey are very careful of their hair, washing it with gogo and anointing\r\nit with ajonjoli oil [20] perfumed with musk.\r\n\r\nIn the 'Relacion de las Islas Philipinas,' 1595 (?), the anonymous\r\nauthor said of the Tagals: \"The people of this province are the best\r\nof all the Islands, more polite, and more truly our friends. They\r\ngo more clothed than the others, the men as well as the women. They\r\nare light-coloured people of very good figures and faces, and like\r\nto put on many ornaments of gold, which they have in great abundance.\"\r\n\r\nIn other respects, however, they seem, from the same author, to be\r\nless worthy of praise, for he goes on to tell us: When some principal\r\nman died, in vengeance of his death they cut off many heads, with\r\nwhich they made many feasts and dances.... They had their houses\r\nfull of wood and stone idols, which they called Tao-tao and Lichac,\r\nfor temples they had none. And they said that when one of their\r\nparents or children died the soul entered into one of these idols,\r\nand for this they reverenced them and begged of them life, health,\r\nand riches. They called these idols anitos, and when they were ill\r\nthey drew lots to find which of these had given them the illness,\r\nand then made great sacrifices and feasts to it.\r\n\r\nThey worshipped idols which were called Al Priapo Lacapati, Meilupa,\r\nbut now, by the goodness of God, they are enlightened with the grace\r\nof the Divine Gospel and adore the living God in spirit.\r\n\r\nThe old writer then remarks on the cleverness and sharpness of the\r\nboys, and the ease with which they learned to read and write, sing,\r\nplay, and dance.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic appears general to the Malay race, for, speaking\r\nof the Javanese, Crauford says: They have ears of remarkable delicacy\r\nfor musical sounds, are readily taught to play upon any instrument\r\nthe most difficult and complex airs.\r\n\r\nAccording to Morga, at the time of the Conquest, the Tagals wrote\r\ntheir language in the Arabic character. He says: They write well in\r\nthese Islands; most people both men and women, can write. This tends\r\nto show that the equality of the sexes, which I shall refer to later,\r\nhas been customary from ancient times.\r\n\r\nTomas de Comyn (1810) says:\r\n\r\nThe population of the capital, in consequence of its continual\r\ncommunication with the Chinese and other Asiatics, with the sailors\r\nof different nations, with the soldiers, and with the Mexican convicts\r\nwho are generally mulattoes, and who arrive in some number every year,\r\nhas come to be a mixture of all the bloods and features, or otherwise\r\na degeneration of the primitive race.\r\n\r\nAt Cainta, on a branch of the Pasig, the natives are darker, taller,\r\nand of a different type. This is accounted for by the fact that,\r\nin 1762-63, during the English invasion, a regiment of Madras Sepoys\r\noccupied the town for many months, long enough, in fact, to modify the\r\nnative type to such an extent as to be plainly visible 125 years later.\r\n\r\nCrauford says that some Christian inhabitants of Ternate followed\r\ntheir priests (Jesuits) to Luzon when the Spaniards were driven out of\r\nMolucas by the Dutch in 1660. They were located in Marigondon. There\r\nis now a town called Ternate between Marigondon and the sea, near\r\nPunta Restinga. But, with the exception of the capital and these\r\ntwo places, I think the Tagals have not greatly altered in physical\r\ncharacteristics since the Conquest--notwithstanding Ratzel's statement\r\nthat \"Spanish-Tagal half-breeds in the Philippines may be numbered\r\nby the hundred thousand,\" which I consider erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that wherever a small number of male Europeans live\r\namongst a native race, the effect on the type is smaller than may\r\nbe supposed, and what there is becomes obliterated or disseminated\r\nin course of time. Colour may be a little altered, but all the other\r\ncharacteristics remain. The mestizas are not so prolific as the native\r\nwomen, and notwithstanding Jagor's assertion to the contrary, they\r\noften marry natives, and especially if their father has died while\r\nthey were young. I knew in the town of Balayan three handsome sisters,\r\ndaughters of a Spaniard who had died many years before. Although they\r\nlived in a house which had been at one time the finest in the town,\r\nand still retained some remnants of its former grandeur, they had\r\nreverted entirely to the native customs and dress. They spoke only\r\nTagal, and all three of them married natives.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the Philippine native to revert to old customs is\r\nwell marked, and I agree with Jagor when he says: \"Every Indian\r\nhas an innate inclination to abandon the hamlets and retire into\r\nthe solitude of the woods, or live isolated in the midst of his own\r\nfields,\" in fact to Remontar.\r\n\r\nThe Tagals are considered by Wallace as the fourth great tribe of the\r\nMalay race. He only mentions the Tagals, but in fact the population\r\nof the Archipelago, except the Negritos and some hybrids, belongs\r\nto the Malay race, although slightly mixed with Chinese and Spanish\r\nblood in a few localities. They are here and there modified by mixture\r\nwith other races, and everywhere by their environment, for they have\r\nbeen Roman Catholics and subject to Spanish influence, if not rule,\r\nfor upwards of three centuries.\r\n\r\nThey differ little in physical appearance from the Malays proper\r\ninhabiting the Peninsula, and although their manners and customs are\r\nsomewhat changed, their nature remains the same. They retain all the\r\ninherent characteristics of the Malay.\r\n\r\nThe Tagal possesses a great deal of self-respect, and his demeanour is\r\nquiet and decorous. He is polite to others, and expects to be treated\r\npolitely himself. He is averse to rowdiness or horse-play of any kind,\r\nand avoids giving offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacteristics--Family Life.\r\n\r\nFor an inhabitant of the tropics he is fairly industrious, sometimes\r\neven very hard working.\r\n\r\nThose who have seen him poling cascos against the stream of the Pasig\r\nwill admit this.\r\n\r\nHe is a keen sportsman, and will readily put his money on his favourite\r\nhorse or game-cock; he is also addicted to other forms of gambling. The\r\nposition taken by women in a community is often considered as a\r\ntest of the degree of civilisation it has attained. Measured by this\r\nstandard, the Tagals come out well, for amongst them the wife exerts\r\ngreat influence in the family, and the husband rarely completes any\r\nimportant business without her concurrence.\r\n\r\nCrauford considers the equality of the sexes to be general throughout\r\nthe Indian Archipelago, more particularly in the Island of Celebes,\r\nwhere the inhabitants are the most warlike of all.\r\n\r\nThe Tagals treat their children with great kindness and forbearance,\r\nthose who are well-off show much anxiety to secure a good education\r\nfor their sons, and even for their daughters.\r\n\r\nParental authority extends to the latest period in life. I have seen\r\na man of fifty years come as respectfully as a child to kiss the\r\nhands of his aged parents when the vesper bell sounded, and this\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of several European visitors in the house.\r\n\r\nChildren, in return, show great respect to both parents, and come\r\nmorning and evening to kiss their hands. I may remark that their\r\nmanner of kissing is different to ours. They place the nose and lips\r\nagainst the cheek or hand of the person to be saluted, and draw in\r\nthe breath strongly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppearance--Manners.\r\n\r\nThe Malays in general are not, perhaps, a handsome race, their flat\r\nnoses disfigure them in the eyes of the recently-arrived European or\r\nAmerican, and it takes time to get accustomed to them.\r\n\r\nStill, their rich brown skin often covers a symmetrical, lithe and\r\nagile figure, the small hands and feet denoting their Turanian origin.\r\n\r\nThe youth of both sexes up to the age of puberty are not seldom\r\nof striking beauty, and their appearance is not belied by their\r\nbehaviour. They are trained in good manners from their earliest youth,\r\nboth by precept and example.\r\n\r\nPalgrave says of them: \"Nowhere are family bonds closer drawn, family\r\naffections more enduring, than amongst the Malay races.... His family\r\nis a pleasing sight, much subordination and little restraint, unison in\r\ngradation, liberty not license. Orderly children, respected parents,\r\nwomen subject, but not suppressed, men ruling, but not despotic,\r\nreverence with kindness, obedience in affection, these form a lovable\r\npicture, nor by any means a rare one in the villages of the Eastern\r\nIsles.\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be interesting to note the very contradictory opinions\r\nthat have been expressed upon this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Foreman.                       W. G. Palgrave.\r\n\r\n'The Philippine Islands,'           'Malay Life in the Philippines,'\r\np. 194.                             p. 146.\r\n\r\n\"Home discipline and training       \"Children early trained by\r\nof manners are quite ignored,       precept and example to good\r\neven in the well-to-do families.    manners, show less disposition\r\nChildren are left without           to noise and mischief than is\r\ncontrol, and allowed to do just     ordinary elsewhere at their\r\nas they please, hence they          age.\"\r\nbecome ill-behaved and boorish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs will be seen in my text, my own experience rather confirms\r\nPalgrave's opinion, and I should say that even the children of the\r\npeasantry would compare favourably both in manners and intelligence\r\nwith the children at the Board Schools in London, and to say nothing\r\nof Glasgow or Liverpool.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Tagals, it is customary when speaking of or to a man to use\r\nthe prefix Si--thus Si Jose, Mr. Joseph--whilst a woman is spoken of\r\nor to as Aling Maria, Miss Mary. The word Po is used for Sir. Thus:\r\nOo-po--Yes, sir; Hindi-po--No, sir; Uala-po--There is none, sir;\r\nMayroom-po--There is some, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe sense of personal dignity and self-respect, the dominant feeling\r\nin the Malay nature, is shown in the Tagals by a general cleanliness\r\nin their persons and clothing. They usually live near water, and\r\nnearly all of them can swim.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the climate makes bathing a pleasure, and as the\r\ntemperature of the sea or river is commonly 83 deg.F., a prolonged\r\nimmersion causes no inconvenience.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of a feast-day the number of bathers is increased,\r\nand at the time of high tide, a very large proportion of the\r\npopulation seems to be in the water, both sexes and all ages mixing\r\nindiscriminately, the adults decently covered and all behaving\r\nthemselves as decorously as the bathers at Brighton, Newport, or\r\nAtlantic City.\r\n\r\nThey have not yet arrived at that precise stage of civilisation that\r\ndevelops the Rough, the Larrikin, or the Hooligan. Palgrave says:\r\nA Malay may be a profligate, a gambler, a thief, a robber, or a\r\nmurderer, he is never a cad.\r\n\r\nPalgrave had not great opportunities of knowing the Tagals, but I\r\nconfirm the above opinion, although I do not agree with the views on\r\nthe future of the Philippines, and what is best for them, expressed\r\nin his fantastic and hyphen-infested verbiage, all seemingly written\r\nfor effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperstitions.\r\n\r\nThe Tagal is extremely superstitious, and like his kinsman, the\r\nDayak, he is a believer in omens, although he has not reduced them\r\nso completely to a system, and three centuries of Christianity have\r\ndiverted his superstitions into other channels.\r\n\r\nIn his mind, each cave, each ravine, each mountain, each pool, each\r\nstream, has its guardian spirit, to offend or to startle which may\r\nbe dangerous. These are the jinni of Southern Arabia and Socotra.\r\n\r\nThe Balete tree (Ficus Urostigima--Sp.) corresponds to our Witch Elm,\r\nand certainly at night has a most uncanny appearance. Each of these\r\ngreat trees has its guardian spirit or Tic-balan.\r\n\r\nDaring, indeed, would be the Indian who would pass such a tree,\r\nenter a cave, ascend a mountain, or plunge into a pool without bowing\r\nand uttering the Pasing tabi sa nono [By your leave, my Lord] that\r\nmay appease the spirit's wrath, just as the Bedouin of Dhofar cry,\r\n\"Aleik Soubera--aleik soubera,\" to propitiate the jinni.\r\n\r\nHis mental attitude in this respect reminds me of a story told me\r\nmany years ago by a lady residing in Hampshire. A lady neighbour of\r\nhers inquired from her whether she taught her children to bow when\r\nthe Devil's name was mentioned. My informant replied in the negative,\r\nwhereupon the lady remarked, \"I do, I think it is safer.\" This is the\r\nway with the Tagal, he bows because he thinks it is safer. If that\r\nprudent lady is still alive and may chance to read this, she may be\r\npleased to learn that her opinion is shared by the whole Malay race.\r\n\r\nChild-birth has its anxieties everywhere, and the more artificial\r\nthe life the woman has led, the more she suffers at that critical\r\ntime. The Tagal woman whose naturally supple frame has never been\r\nsubjected to tight-lacing, nor compressed within a tailor-made costume,\r\nhas a far easier time of it than her European sister, but superstition\r\nand quackery combine to terrify and ill-use her.\r\n\r\nThe Patianac, an evil spirit, profits by the occasion, and his\r\ngreat delight is to obstruct the birth, or to kill and devour the\r\ninfant. The patianac might be busy elsewhere, but from the ridge-pole\r\nof the house a bird of ill-omen, the dreadful Tic-tic, raises a warning\r\ncry, for its office and delight is to call the attention of the evil\r\nspirit to the opportunity of doing mischief. Instantly every door\r\nand window is closed and every chink stopped to prevent its entrance,\r\nwhilst the anxious father and his kinsmen, naked as they were born,\r\nwalk around and underneath the house, slashing the air with sticks\r\nor bolos to frighten away the spirit. Sometimes a man will get up on\r\nthe ridge-pole to drive away the Tic-tic.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the stifling room, it is too often the case that violent\r\nmeans are used to expedite the birth, so violent indeed, that they\r\nsometimes result in the permanent injury or in the death of the woman.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the Government instituted an examination for midwives,\r\nand only those were allowed the practice who had been properly\r\ninstructed, so that these absurdities and cruelties are on the wane,\r\nexcept amongst the poorest or in outlying districts.\r\n\r\nThe Asuan is merely a cannibal ghost, but the Tagal ghost throws\r\nstones, a thing I have not heard of a ghost doing in Europe.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of stories are told about the Asuan, similar to ghost\r\nstories in other lands.\r\n\r\nAbout 1891 a house in Malate was stoned night after night, and\r\nalthough every effort was made to find out the authors, they were\r\nnever discovered, and the natives steadfastly believed it to be the\r\ndoing of the Asuan.\r\n\r\nThere is another superstitious idea firmly rooted in the minds of\r\nthe Tagals and other natives, of which the following is an instance:\r\nA villainous-looking native had been captured with some property stolen\r\nfrom my house, and was sent to the lock-up at the police station, from\r\nwhence he promptly escaped, but was recaptured later. My coachman,\r\na most meritorious servant who had been with me for years, assured\r\nme in an impressive manner, and with an air of conviction, that\r\nthe culprit was one of those wizards who are able to pass through\r\na keyhole by drawing themselves out into the thinness of a piece of\r\nstring, and my other servants accepted this view implicitly.\r\n\r\nThe famous Tulisanes or bandits, thoroughly believe in the power of the\r\nAntin-Antin or amulet to render them invulnerable to bullets. It is,\r\nindeed, remarkable that notwithstanding the numbers of these criminals\r\nwho have been shot by the Guardia Civil with their Antin-Antin upon\r\nthem, this absurd belief should flourish, but there is no doubt it\r\ndoes. These charms consist of any sort of necromancers' rubbish, or\r\nare sometimes writings in invocations, usually worn round the neck\r\nunder the clothing.\r\n\r\nThe profession of the Roman Catholic religion has perhaps helped this\r\nsuperstition to linger on, for the wearing of scapularies is common,\r\nespecially amongst the women. These articles are manufactured for\r\nthe priests and some are sent out to Antipolo, to be blessed at the\r\nshrine of Nuestra Senora de Buen Viage y de la Paz, and sold to the\r\npilgrims who crowd in thousands to this shrine in May of each year.\r\n\r\nA Tagal woman sometimes wears as many as three of these scapularies\r\nhung from silk threads round her neck and covered by her upper\r\ngarment. They usually dispose two in front, where they conceive the\r\ndanger is greatest, and one on the back, as a further precaution\r\nagainst an attack from the rear.\r\n\r\nWearing these holy amulets, and having crossed herself and uttered\r\na prayer before coming downstairs in the morning, the Tagal wife or\r\nmaid feels that she has done all she can, and that if any backsliding\r\nshould occur, during the day, it will not be her fault.\r\n\r\nShe believes greatly in lucky or holy numbers--I heard the following\r\nstory related by a native lady to a native priest when going to\r\nBatangas by steamer.\r\n\r\nThe lady was telling the priest of her husband's illness (it appeared\r\nto have been congestion of the lungs), and she prepared and applied a\r\npoultice of three heads of garlic in honour of the Three Persons of the\r\nBlessed Trinity; this not producing the desired effect, she then made a\r\npoultice of five heads of garlic, in honour of the Five Wounds of our\r\nBlessed Saviour, and successively others of seven heads, in honour of\r\nthe Seven Pains of the Blessed Virgin; twelve heads in honour of the\r\nTwelve Apostles, and last of all a poultice of thirty-three heads\r\nof garlic in honour of the Thirty-three years our Blessed Saviour\r\nremained on earth. The priest had nodded approval as she went on,\r\nbut as she stopped he said: \"And then?\" To which the lady replied,\r\n\"Then he died.\"\r\n\r\nThis poor man came off easily, for in some cases people who suffer\r\nfrom fits and other diseases are thought to be possessed by devils,\r\nand are severely beaten to drive out the evil spirit. The patient\r\ndoes not always escape with his life.\r\n\r\nThe women often dream of lucky numbers in the Manila Lottery and make\r\nevery endeavour to purchase the number they have dreamt of.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Christian superstitions may be mentioned the feast of San\r\nPascual Bailon at Obando. Those who attend this function are commonly\r\nthe rowdier class of inhabitants of the Capital, and they go mostly\r\non foot, making music and dancing on the way. They also dance in the\r\ncourtyard in front of the church, not forgetting to refresh themselves\r\nwith strong drink in the meanwhile.\r\n\r\nThis is not at all an edifying spectacle, for the dancers are covered\r\nwith dust and with the perspiration from their active exertions. I\r\ndo not know the legend that gives occasion to this curious form of\r\ndevotion. Occasionally, and especially during Holy Week, another form\r\nof penitence is practised by the natives. I remember, about 1892,\r\nseeing one of these penitents, a man having a mask on his face, the\r\nupper part of his body bare, and a long chain fastened to one ankle\r\nand dragging on the ground behind him. In one hand he bore a flagellum\r\nwith which he from time to time lashed himself on the shoulders,\r\nwhich bore evident marks of the discipline they had received. A youth\r\nwho followed him occasionally jerked the chain, throwing the penitent\r\nviolently at full length upon the dusty road. This form of penitence\r\nis not approved, however, by the priests, for when I called on the\r\nparish priest, the same evening, I mentioned the circumstance to him,\r\nand he directed the penitent to be locked up, to stop what he rightly\r\ntermed a scandal.\r\n\r\nOn many occasions the natives had got up a religious excitement,\r\nand great gatherings have taken place at some spot where a miraculous\r\nappearance of the Blessed Virgin, or some supernatural manifestation\r\nhas been alleged to have occurred.\r\n\r\nAll these affairs have been somewhat sceptically inquired into by the\r\npriests under a general order to this effect issued by the archbishop,\r\nand so far as my experience goes, the excessive religious ardour of\r\nthe natives has rather been checked than stimulated.\r\n\r\nWhen writing about the Visayas I shall have more to say about\r\nmisdirected religious zeal. The Tagals practise circumcision as\r\na hygienic measure, and not as a religious rite. The operation is\r\nusually performed at the age of fourteen by a companion or friend of\r\nthe patient, and a sharp flint or piece of volcanic glass (obsidian)\r\nis used for this purpose. From what I have heard, this custom is really\r\nmaintained by the women, who refuse their favours to the uncircumcised\r\nof their own nation, though with foreigners they are more complaisant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCursing.\r\n\r\nIn cursing, the Tagal displays a directness quite worthy of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon. All his remarks are very much to the point, and would\r\nhave earned the approval of the late lamented and reverend author of\r\nthe Ingoldsby Legends. Leaving out the world-wide reflections upon\r\nthe virtues of an opponent's female ancestry, since these appear to\r\nbelong indiscriminately to all nations, the principal Tagal curses\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        1. May an evil wind blow upon you.\r\n        2. May the earth open and swallow you up.\r\n        3. May the lightning strike you.\r\n        4. May the alligator eat you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the Tagal style as compared with the French\r\nMortbleu, Ventre bleu, must be apparent to all unprejudiced\r\nobservers. The Tagal has drawn all his curses from the grand and awful\r\noperations of nature in his own country, except the last, where he\r\ninvokes the dreaded saurian, the most fearsome inhabitant of the\r\nPhilippine swamps, rivers, and coasts--formerly venerated by his\r\nancestors and respectfully addressed by them as nono, or grandfather.\r\n\r\nUnder American guidance and example, I think the Tagals quite capable\r\nof developing a startling vocabulary of swear-words, and in course\r\nof time rivalling their instructors in profanity, with a touch of\r\ntheir old style to give a little local colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourtship.\r\n\r\nCourtship is sometimes a long business amongst the Tagals. It is still\r\ncustomary in the country districts for the impecunious candidate for\r\nmatrimony to serve the father of the damsel he desires to wed for a\r\nperiod which may extend to a couple of years or more. He is called a\r\nCatipado, and is expected to make himself generally useful, and to\r\ntake a hand in any labour that may be going on, sowing or reaping,\r\nmending the roof, or patching the canoe.\r\n\r\nIt is his privilege to assist the girl of his choice in her\r\nlabours. The girls of a household are expected to husk the rice\r\nfor the next day's use. This is done in the cool of the evening,\r\nout of doors, a wooden mortar and long heavy pestle being used. It\r\nis a well-recognised occasion for the lover to assist and entertain\r\nhis sweetheart.\r\n\r\nVery pretty do the village maidens look, as, lightly clothed in almost\r\ndiaphanous garments, they stand beside the mortars plying the pestle,\r\nalternately rising on tiptoe, stretching the lithe figure to its full\r\nheight and reach, then bending swiftly to give force to the blow.\r\n\r\nNo attitude could display to more advantage the symmetry of form which\r\nis the Tagal maiden's heritage, and few sights are more pleasing than\r\na group of these tawny damsels husking paddy midst chat and laughter,\r\nwhile a tropical full moon pours its effulgence on their glistening\r\ntresses and rounded arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarriage.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the Catipado. He must be very careful not to\r\ngive cause of offence to the elders of the family, more especially\r\ntowards the end of his term, as there may be a disposition amongst\r\nthem to dismiss him, and take on another to begin a new term. In fact,\r\nmany natives have shown themselves so unwilling to consent to their\r\ndaughter's marriage, when no sufficient reason could be given for\r\ntheir refusal, that the Governor-General, representing the Crown,\r\nis entrusted with a special power of granting the paternal consent\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\nNo regular marriage can be celebrated whilst the girl is a minor,\r\nwithout the father's consent.\r\n\r\nWhen this is refused, and the patience of the lovers is exhausted,\r\nthe girl leaves her father's house and is deposited in the house of\r\nthe fiscal, or churchwarden, under the care of his wife.\r\n\r\nA petition on stamped paper is then prepared, reciting the\r\ncircumstances; this goes to the parish priest and to the\r\nGobernadorcillo, who require the father to state the grounds of\r\nhis refusal. If they are satisfied that no good reason exists,\r\nthe petition, with their approval noted on it, goes to the\r\nGovernor-General, and in due time a notification appears in the\r\nofficial Gazette that the Governor-General has been pleased to overrule\r\nthe father's negative, and a license (on stamped paper also) for the\r\nmarriage to be celebrated, is delivered to the priest. This procedure\r\nis very necessary, but it has the disadvantage of being slow and\r\nexpensive, so that in some cases, instead of adopting this course,\r\nthe youthful pair allow themselves some advances of the privileges of\r\nmatrimony, and perhaps there arrives a time when the obdurate parent\r\nfinds himself obliged to consent to legalise an accomplished fact to\r\navoid an open scandal.\r\n\r\nThe erring damsel, however, may think herself lucky if she escapes\r\na fatherly correction laid on with no grudging hand, before the\r\nreluctant consent is granted.\r\n\r\nThe priest will of course require the youthful sinners to confess\r\nand do penance for their previousness before he will marry them.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony is a very simple one, and usually takes place\r\nafter early Mass. The priest fixes the fee according to the means\r\nof the party; it is often a substantial one. After the ceremony\r\ncomes a Catapusan or assembly, when the relatives and friends are\r\nentertained. There will be music, and unless the priest disapproves\r\nof dancing, that will be indulged in. The Augustinians mostly allow\r\ndancing, but the Dominicans often object to it as an immoral amusement.\r\n\r\nThe house will be hung with bright-coloured cloths and paper lanterns;\r\nthe table loaded with refreshments, both light and heavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWedding Feasts.\r\n\r\nRoast pig is a standing dish at these feasts, the animal being roasted\r\nwhole, on a spit over a fire made on the ground. A professional roaster\r\nsuperintends the operation, and the pig is brought to a fine even\r\ncolour all over. Sometimes there are roast turkeys or roast mutton and\r\nkid, possibly beef cooked in various ways, surely fish of different\r\nkinds, fresh, salted, or smoked; the indispensable boiled rice or\r\nmorisqueta, and an abundance of sweets, fruits in syrup, guava jelly,\r\nand Dutch cheese. There will be chocolate and perhaps coffee. As to\r\ndrinks, besides some native brews, there will be Norwegian or German\r\nexport beer, or Tennant's beer in stone bottles, square-face gin,\r\nand Spanish red wine (Vino Tinto).\r\n\r\nUnlimited Buyo, cigarettes and cigars are provided. All these things\r\nare hospitably pressed upon all comers, especially upon any European\r\npresent. If his politeness prevents his refusing this miscellaneous\r\nassortment, unless he is favoured with the digestion of an ostrich, he\r\nwill rue it next day, and perhaps for several days. The worthy priest\r\nis naturally in the place of honour, and like the wise man he mostly\r\nis, he perhaps brings, slung under his habit, or sends beforehand,\r\na capacious leather bottle, with a supply of generous wine direct\r\nfrom some convent vineyard on the peninsula, a pure natural wine,\r\nundefiled and unfortified by German industrial spirit. A tall and\r\nportly Augustine monk, in his spotless and ample white robes, presents\r\na very imposing and apostolic appearance, and looks quite in his place\r\nat the head of the table. The host seldom sits down with his guests,\r\nbut busies himself attending to their wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTAGALS AS SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe houses of the well-to-do natives are large and airy, and are kept\r\nscrupulously clean under the vigilant eye of the mistress.\r\n\r\nHospitality is a characteristic of the Tagal. According to his means\r\nhe keeps open house on religious feast-days or on family festivals,\r\nand readily invites to his table at any time travellers who may be\r\npassing through the town. Having enjoyed their hospitality on many\r\noccasions, I can testify to their kindness and liberality. They placed\r\nat my disposal their riding-ponies, vehicles or canoes, and did all\r\nin their power to show me anything remarkable in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe Tagals make good soldiers, and can march long distances\r\nbarefooted. Morga remarks how quickly they learned to use the arquebus\r\nor musket in the wars of the conquest. They gave proofs of their\r\npluck and endurance when assisting the French in Tonquin. If well\r\nled they will advance regardless of danger; when once engaged they\r\nbecome frenzied and blood-thirsty, most difficult to restrain. They\r\nare not improved by being made to wear gloves, boots, helmets, and\r\nEuropean uniforms.\r\n\r\nIn this they are not singular, for the Ceylon Rifle Regiment (a Malay\r\ncorps) was utterly ruined, and never did any good after being put\r\ninto boots and gloves by some narrow-minded martinet.\r\n\r\nAs sailors they are unsurpassed in the East. They navigate their\r\nschooners and lorchas with much skill, although the rigging and\r\noutfit is seldom kept in thorough good order unless they have a\r\nSpanish captain.\r\n\r\nThey serve both as sailors and firemen in the fine flotilla of\r\ncoasting-steamers belonging to Manila, and they manned all the smaller\r\nvessels of the Spanish Navy in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nMost of the British and foreign steamers in the far East carry four\r\nManila men as quarter-masters. They are considered to be the most\r\nskilful helmsmen. Their ability as mechanics is remarkable. They\r\nbear out entirely Morga's description of them: \"Of good talent for\r\nanything they undertake.\"\r\n\r\nThey will, without any European supervision, heave down wooden\r\nsailing-vessels up to about 1000 tons, and repair the keel, or\r\nstrip, caulk, and re-copper the bottom. I have often seen this\r\ndone. They build from the excellent hard wood of the country,\r\nbrigantines, schooners, lorchas, also cascos, and other craft for\r\ninland navigation and shallow waters. These latter vessels are most\r\ningeniously contrived, and admirably adapted to the conditions under\r\nwhich they are to be used, and although not decked, carry their cargoes\r\ndry, and in good order, in the wettest weather. They make the most\r\ngraceful canoes, and paddle or punt them with remarkable dexterity.\r\n\r\nIn Manila and Cavite are to be found a fair number of native\r\nengine-fitters, turners, smiths and boiler-makers.\r\n\r\nThere must be some 400 steam sugar-mills in the islands (besides\r\n6000 cattle-mills). The engine-drivers and firemen are all natives,\r\nand mostly Tagals.\r\n\r\nThere are also in the capital large numbers of native house-carpenters,\r\nquarrymen, stone-masons, and some brick-layers and brick-makers.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, foundry work is not much done by Tagals, although\r\nwhen Legaspi arrived in Luzon he not only found cannon mounted at\r\nManila, but there was a cannon-foundry there, and another at Tondo.\r\n\r\nThere are foundries at the latter place to this day belonging to\r\nChinese half-castes, but church bells are more to their way now\r\nthan cannon. They, however, cast small brass mortars with handles\r\nlike quart pots, which are used for firing salutes at the feasts of\r\nthe church. But I think most of the workmen were then, and are now,\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\nThey make their own gunpowder, and fireworks of all kinds. They are\r\ninordinately fond of these, and get up very creditable displays. They\r\nare careless in handling them, and I was eye-witness of an explosion\r\nof fireworks during a water fete, on the passing in front of the\r\ngovernor's palace at Malacanan, when a number of people were killed. I\r\nnever learned how many had perished, and the newspapers were forbidden\r\nto enlarge upon it.\r\n\r\nExcellent carriages are built in Manila entirely by native labour,\r\nthe carromatas, or two-wheeled vehicles used for travelling, being\r\nmade in the suburbs, or in Malabon.\r\n\r\nCarriage-building is an important trade, for an incredible number of\r\nvehicles of all sorts are used in Manila.\r\n\r\nOf an evening, in the Luneta, some hundreds may be seen, and on one\r\noccasion, at the races of the Jockey Club in Santa Mesa, two thousand\r\nvehicles were reported to be present.\r\n\r\nPainting and decorating is executed by Manila men in excellent\r\nstyle. This art was taught them by Alberoni, and other Italians. Their\r\npupils have covered the walls of many buildings with frescoes in the\r\nItalian style, very fairly done. There is much scope for their art\r\nin decorating altars and shrines.\r\n\r\nThe Tagals also show some talent for sculpture, as any visitor to\r\nManila can see for himself by inspecting the Jesuit Church, which\r\nis a marvel of patient artistic labour, having taken eleven years\r\nto construct. Some of the carving there, however, is so delicate and\r\nminutely detailed, that it appears more suitable for a show case in\r\na museum than for the adornment of a place of worship. Of course,\r\nevery detail of design is due to the Jesuits themselves, amongst whom\r\ntalented men of every profession can be found.\r\n\r\nAs a fisherman, the Tagal excels, and the broad expanse of Manila Bay,\r\nsome 700 square miles in area, gives ample scope for his ingenuity. He\r\npractises every kind of fishing Corrales de Pesca, or fish-stakes\r\nwithin the five-fathom line, casting nets and seines in the shallow\r\nwater, huge sinking nets attached to bamboo shear-legs mounted on\r\nrafts in the estuaries, drift nets and line-fishing in the deeper\r\nparts of the bay.\r\n\r\nFrom Tondo, from Paranaque, Las Pinas, Bacoor, and Cavite Viejo,\r\nand from dozens of other villages, go hundreds of large canoes,\r\ncrowded with men, and heaped up with nets, to fish near the San\r\nNicolas Bank, or about Corregidor Island, and they often return with\r\nlarge catches. Some fish by night, with torch and spear; in fact,\r\nthey seem to be quite at home at any kind of fishing.\r\n\r\nThe nets and sails of the canoes, and the clothes of the fishermen,\r\nare all tanned by them with the bark of the camanchile tree.\r\n\r\nThe salting, drying, or smoking of the fish caught in the bay is quite\r\nan extensive business. The smoked sardines, or tinapa, are very tasty,\r\nas also the pickled mullet roes called Bagon de Lisa. But the small\r\nshrimps fermented in a jar, and brought to a particular stage of\r\nputrefaction, [21] much appreciated by the natives, will not suit\r\nEuropean or American tastes.\r\n\r\nThe vast Bay of Manila holds fish and mammals of all sorts and sizes,\r\nfrom small fry to that huge but harmless monster of the deep, Rhinodon\r\ntipicus, with a mouth like the opening of a hansom cab, scooping in\r\njelly-fish by the bushel.\r\n\r\nThe peje-rey, like a smelt, the lenguado, or sole, the lisa, or\r\nmullet, the bacoco, corbina, pampano, and others whose names I have\r\nforgotten, are excellent. The oysters are good, but very small. Prawns\r\nare excellent, large and cheap. Crabs are good, but large ones are\r\nnot plentiful. Clawless lobsters are caught amongst the rocks of\r\nCorregidor and Mariveles. The largest turtle I have ever seen was\r\ncaught off Malabon. It can be seen in the Jesuits' Museum, Manila.\r\n\r\nSharks of all sorts, enormous saw-fish, [22] hideous devil-fish,\r\n[23] and monstrous conger eels, as well as poisonous black and yellow\r\nsea-snakes, abound, so that the fisherman does not have everything his\r\nown way. Amongst these men are to be found some excellent divers. I\r\nhave found them quite able to go down to the keel of a large ship and\r\nreport whether any damage has been done. Where a sheet of copper has\r\nbeen torn off, they have nailed on a new sheet, getting in two or three\r\nnails every time they went down. I enquired from one of these men who\r\nhad frequently dived for me, when a European diver with diving-gear\r\ncould not be obtained, if he was not afraid of sharks? He answered,\r\n\"No es hora del tiburon\"--it is not the sharks' time--and I found he\r\nconsidered that he was very fairly safe from the sharks between ten and\r\nfour. Before ten and after four was a dangerous time, as the sharks\r\nwere on the look-out for a meal. I cannot say that I should like to\r\ntrust to this, especially as I have seen sharks about at other times,\r\nand one afternoon, in the bay, had to keep off a hammerheaded-shark\r\nfrom coming near a British diver who was examining the rudder of a\r\nsteamer, by firing at it from the stern. Some sharks are heavy and\r\nslow-moving creatures, but the hammer-headed kind are endowed with\r\na surprising activity, and twist and turn like an eel.\r\n\r\nMy native diver informed me that he was much more afraid of the\r\nManta than of any shark, and that once when he was diving for some\r\npurpose--I do not recollect when--at the bottom a shade fell on him,\r\nand, on looking up, he beheld an enormous manta right above him--in\r\nhis words, \"as big as a lighter.\" However, it passed on, and he was\r\nable to regain the surface.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable talent possessed by the Tagal is his gift\r\nfor instrumental music.\r\n\r\nEach parish has its brass band supplied with European instruments,\r\nthe musicians generally wearing a quasi-military uniform. If the\r\nvillage is a rich one, there is usually a string band as well. They\r\nplay excellently, as do the military bands. Each infantry battalion\r\nhad its band, whilst that of the Peninsular Artillery, of ninety\r\nperformers, under a band-master holding the rank of lieutenant, was\r\none of the finest bands I have ever heard. There were few countries\r\nwhere more music could be heard gratis than in the Philippines,\r\nand for private dances these bands could be hired at moderate rates.\r\n\r\nThe Tagal is also a good agriculturist. According to his lights, he\r\ncultivates paddy with great care. It is all raised in seed-plots, the\r\nsoil of which is carefully prepared, and fenced about. The fields are\r\nploughed and harrowed whilst covered with water, so that the surface\r\nis reduced to soft mud. When the ground is ready for planting, the\r\nwhole population turns out, and, being supplied with the young shoots\r\nin bundles, of which tally is kept, proceed to plant each individual\r\nshoot of paddy by hand.\r\n\r\nAnkle-deep in the soft mud of the paddy-fields stand long rows of\r\nbare-legged men, women and children, each in a stooping position,\r\nholding against the body with the left hand a large bundle of\r\nrice-plants, incessantly and rapidly seizing a shoot with the right\r\nhand, and plunging it into the black slime with the forefinger\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nHour after hour the patient toil goes on, and day after day, in all the\r\nglare of the burning sun, reflected and intensified from the surface\r\nof the black water, till the whole vast surface has been planted. The\r\nmatandang-sa-naya, or village elder, then announces how many millions\r\nof rice shoots have been put in. The labour is most exhausting,\r\nfrom the stooping position, which is obligatory, and because the eyes\r\nbecome inflamed from the reflection of the sun on the black water. As\r\nthe paddy is planted during the rainy season, it often happens that\r\nthe work is done under a tropical downpour instead of a blazing sun.\r\n\r\nWhen driving along a road through paddy-fields in October, it\r\nseems incredible that every blade of that luxuriant crop has been\r\ntransplanted by hand. Yet the people who do this are branded as\r\nlazy. I think that they are quite ready to work for a sufficient\r\ninducement. Whenever I had works to execute I never experienced any\r\ndifficulty in obtaining men. I made it a rule to pay every man with\r\nmy own hands every Saturday his full wages without deductions. On\r\nMonday morning, if I wanted 300 men, there would be 500 to pick and\r\nchoose from. I should like to see some of their depreciators try an\r\nhour's work planting paddy, or poling a casco up stream.\r\n\r\nThe undulating nature of the ground renders it necessary to divide\r\npaddy land into small plots of irregular outline at varying levels,\r\ndivided from each other by ridges of earth called pilapiles, so as\r\nto retain the rain or irrigation water, allowing it to descend slowly\r\nfrom level to level till it reaches its outlet at the lowest point. The\r\nTagals fully justify their Turanian origin by the skill and care which\r\nthey show in irrigation. About Manila, the sacate, or meadow-grass,\r\nwhich is the principal food of the thousands of ponies in the city,\r\nis cultivated on lands which are exactly at a level to be flooded by\r\nthe spring-tides.\r\n\r\nThe mango-tree is carefully cultivated, and the fruit is, to some\r\nextent, forced by lighting fires of leaves and twigs under these trees\r\nevery evening in the early part of the year to drive off insects,\r\nand give additional warmth.\r\n\r\nIn Batangas and La Luguna, and, to some extent, in Bulacan, the Tagals\r\ncultivate the sugar-cane successfully.\r\n\r\nBut where they really shine, where all their care is lavished,\r\nwhere nothing is too much trouble, is in the cultivation of the buyo\r\n(Piper betel). This is a climbing plant, and is grown on sticks\r\nlike hops. There were many plantations of this near Pineda, which I\r\nfrequently visited. It is grown in small fields, enclosed by hedges\r\nor by rows of trees to keep off the wind.\r\n\r\nThe soil is carefully prepared, and all weeds removed. As the tendrils\r\ngrow up, the sticks are placed for them. The plants are watered by\r\nhand, and leaf by leaf carefully examined every morning to remove\r\nall caterpillars or other insects. The plants are protected from the\r\nglare of the sun by mat-shades supported on bamboos.\r\n\r\nThe ripe leaves are gathered fresh every morning, and taken to market,\r\nwhere they find a ready sale at remunerative prices for chewing with\r\nthe areca nut, and a pinch of slaked shell lime.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have had Tagal hunters with me deer-shooting, I have\r\nbeen struck with their knowledge of the natural history of their\r\nlocality. They thoroughly understood the habits of the game, and\r\nalmost always foretold correctly the direction from which the deer\r\nwould approach the guns.\r\n\r\nThey have names for every animal and bird, and for the different ages\r\nor conditions, or size of antlers, of the deer.\r\n\r\nEven insects and reptiles are named by them; they could give details\r\nof their habits, and knew whether they were poisonous or dangerous.\r\n\r\nThey always showed themselves greatly interested in sport, and much\r\nappreciated a good shot. They spoke of a gun that killed well as a hot\r\ngun (baril mainit). If they were trusted with a gun they were very\r\nreluctant to spend a cartridge unless for a dead certainty. If two\r\ncartridges are given to a hunter, he will bring in two deer or pigs,\r\notherwise he will apologise for wasting a cartridge, and explain how\r\nit happened.\r\n\r\nTheir usual way of taking game is to set strong nets of abaca in the\r\nwoods in the form of a V, then the beaters and dogs drive the game\r\ntowards the hunters, who are concealed near the apex, and who kill\r\nthe deer or wild pigs with their lances whilst entangled in the nets.\r\n\r\nI have found the Tagals very satisfactory as domestic servants,\r\nalthough not so hard-working as the Ilocanos. Some of them could clean\r\nglass or plate as well as an English butler, and could lay the table\r\nfor a dinner party and ornament tastefully with flowers and ferns,\r\nfolding the napkins like a Parisian waiter.\r\n\r\nThey could also write out the menu (their orthography having been\r\npreviously corrected), and serve the dinner and wines in due sequence\r\nwithout requiring any directions during the meal.\r\n\r\nSome of them remained in my service the whole time I was in the\r\nPhilippines; one of them, Paulino Morillo, came to England with me\r\nin charge of my two sons, and afterwards made three voyages to Cuba\r\nwith me. I gratefully acknowledge his faithful service. His portrait\r\nis appended.\r\n\r\nI did not find them sufficiently punctual and regular as cooks, nor\r\ndid they make their purchases in the market to as much advantage as the\r\nChinese cooks, who never bid one against another to raise the price.\r\n\r\nAs clerks and store-keepers I found the Tagals honest, assiduous,\r\nand well-behaved. As draughtsmen they were fairly skilful in drawing\r\nfrom hand sketches, and excelled in copying or tracing, but were quite\r\nuntrustworthy in taking out quantities and computing. Some of them\r\ncould write beautiful headings, or design ornamental title-pages. I\r\nhave by me some of their work that could not be done better even in\r\nGermany or France. But the more skilful they were the more irregular\r\nwas their attendance, and the more they had learned the worse they\r\nbehaved.\r\n\r\nWhen doing business with the Tagals, I found that the elder men could\r\nbe trusted. If I gave them credit, which was often the case, for\r\none or two years, I could depend upon the money being paid when due,\r\nunless some calamity such as a flood or a conflagration had rendered\r\nit absolutely impossible for them to find the cash. In such a case\r\n(which seldom happened) they would advise me beforehand, and perhaps\r\nbring a portion of the money, giving a pagare, bearing interest, for\r\nthe remainder, and never by any possibility denying the debt. I never\r\nmade a bad debt amongst them, and gladly testify to their punctilious\r\nhonesty. This idea of the sacredness of an obligation seems to prevail\r\namongst many of the Malay races, even among the pagan savages, as\r\nI had occasion to observe when I visited the Tagbanuas in Palawan\r\n(Paragua). They certainly did not learn this from the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe More Instruction the less Honesty.\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with the younger men who had been educated in Manila,\r\nin Hong Kong, or even in Europe, I found that this idea had been\r\neradicated from them, and that no sufficient sense of honour had been\r\nimplanted in its stead.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I may say that, whilst the unlettered agriculturist, with his\r\nold-fashioned dress, and quiet, dignified manner, inspired me with\r\nthe respect due to an honest and worthy man, the feeling evolved\r\nfrom a discussion with the younger and educated men, dressed in\r\nEuropean clothes, who had been pupils in the Ateneo Municipal, or in\r\nSanto Tomas, was less favourable, and it became evident to me that,\r\nalthough they might be more instructed than their fathers, they were\r\nmorally below them. Either their moral training had been deficient,\r\nor their natures are not improved by education. I usually preferred\r\nto do business with them on a cash basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnsuitable Training.\r\n\r\nDare I, at the tail-end of the nineteenth century, in the days of\r\nBoard Schools, County Councils, conscientious objectors, and Hooligans,\r\nventure to recall to mind a saying of that grand old Conservative, the\r\nPeruvian Solomon, Tupac Inca Yupanqui? \"Science should only be taught\r\nto those of generous blood, for the meaner sort are only puffed up,\r\nand rendered vain and arrogant by it. Neither should such mingle in\r\nthe affairs of state, for by that means high offices are brought into\r\ndisrepute.\" [24]\r\n\r\nThat great monarch's words exactly express my conclusions about the\r\nyoung Tagals and other natives.\r\n\r\nTo take a young native lad away from his parents, to place him in a\r\ncorrupted capital like Manila, and to cram him with the intricacies\r\nof Spanish law, while there is probably, not in all those who surround\r\nhim, one single honest and upright man he can look up to for guidance\r\nand example, is to deprive him of whatever principles of action he may\r\nonce have possessed, whilst giving him no guide for his future conduct.\r\n\r\nHe acquires the European vices without the virtues; loses his native\r\nmodesty and self-respect, and develops too often into a contemptible\r\npica-pleito, or pettifogger, instead of becoming an honest farmer.\r\n\r\nThe more educated Tagals are fond of litigation, and with the\r\nassistance of native or half-caste lawyers will carry on the most\r\nfrivolous and vexatious lawsuit with every artifice that cunning and\r\nutter unscrupulousness can suggest. The corrupt nature of the Spanish\r\ncourts is a mainstay to such people. Although they may be possessed\r\nof ample means litigants often obtain from the court permission to\r\nsue a foreigner in forma pauperis.\r\n\r\nThey are unscrupulous about evidence, and many will perjure themselves\r\nor bring false witnesses without shame. It is said that blank stamped\r\npaper of any year can be obtained for a sufficient price for the\r\npurpose of forging documents relating to the sale of land; as there\r\nare people who regularly keep it for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of envy is strong within them, and any Spaniard or\r\nforeigner who appears to be succeeding in an industrial enterprise in\r\nthe provinces, such as planting or mining, is sure, sooner or later,\r\nto be attacked by the pettifoggers or their men of straw, and he will\r\nbe bled heavily when he comes before the courts, and perhaps have to\r\ngo to the Court of Appeal or even to the Tribunal Supremo in Madrid\r\nbefore he can obtain a verdict in his favour.\r\n\r\nThe credulity of the Tagal is remarkable; he has on occasion given\r\nway to outbursts of ferocity, involving death and destruction to\r\nnumbers of innocent people.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, during an epidemic of cholera, he was led to believe that\r\nthis strange sickness had been produced by the foreigners, who had\r\npoisoned the water. An indiscriminate massacre of foreigners was the\r\nconsequence of this calumny, and but few escaped. The authorities,\r\nalways prompt to repress uprisings against the Government, allowed time\r\nfor the foreigners to be massacred before they interfered. It is not\r\neasy to say how many English, French, or Americans met their deaths\r\nat the hands of the populace, for such details are never allowed to\r\nbe published.\r\n\r\nI may say, however, that one should not be too hard on the Tagals\r\nfor this crime, since at a much later date a massacre of priests\r\noccurred in Madrid, on account of a similar belief. It was started\r\nbecause a lad, the servant of a priest, was seen to throw some white\r\npowder into the Fuente Castellana. I have not at hand the details of\r\nthis massacre, but the friars were slaughtered like pigs.\r\n\r\nIn the dreadful epidemic of cholera in 1882, the natives behaved very\r\nwell, and I must give General Primo de Rivera credit for keeping\r\nstrict order and promptly organising the construction of temporary\r\nhospitals, the inspection of every parish of the city, the conveyance\r\nof the sick to hospital, and the burial of the dead. It was done\r\nunder military direction, and with the assistance of the priests,\r\nthe civil authorities, and the principal inhabitants. No disturbances\r\noccurred owing to the strong hand of the Governor-General, although\r\nsome of the evil-disposed natives began to murmur about the doctors\r\ncarrying about the disease.\r\n\r\nThe mortality was dreadful; I believe that some 30,000 people lost\r\ntheir lives in the city and province of Manila in three or four\r\nmonths. In order to nurse the sick and bury the vast number of dead,\r\nit was necessary to employ the convicts and prisoners. All these people\r\nbehaved remarkably well, although many succumbed to the disease. The\r\nsurvivors were pardoned outright, or had their sentences reduced. If\r\nthe Governor-General had shown signs of weakness, the horrors of 1820\r\nmight have been repeated.\r\n\r\nTo give a better idea of the credulity of the Tagals and other\r\nnatives, I may say that in 1868 telegrams were received in Manila\r\n(via Hong Kong), which were made public in the islands, announcing\r\nthe Spanish revolution of September, and the news, with stupendous\r\nexaggerations, reached the remotest villages and the most miserable\r\nhuts. A general and indelible idea took possession of the minds of\r\nthe natives that Revolution (they thought it was a new emperor or a\r\ngreat personage) had decreed that all were equal, that there should\r\nbe no difference between Indians and Spaniards, that the latter had\r\nto return to Spain and Indians be substituted in all employments,\r\nand that the tribute would be greatly reduced. That there would be\r\nno conscription nor corvee (personal work), that the Pope would name\r\nseveral Indian bishops, and that the Spanish priests would return\r\nto the Peninsula. That a new captain-general would arrive who would\r\nmarry a native lady, who would be made a princess, that their children\r\nwould be kings and sovereigns of the Philippine Empire.\r\n\r\nAll this was confirmed by prophecies, by dreams, and revelations, and\r\ngreat miracles by the Virgin of Antipolo and of St. Joseph, and other\r\npatrons of the Indies, not omitting St. Peter, for whom the native\r\nclergy profess a profound veneration, and who is the patron saint of\r\na brotherhood which has caused much trouble in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gandara, informed of all these absurdities by the friars,\r\ndid not fail to appreciate the immense importance of the movement\r\nwhich, like the teachings of the so-called gods of Panay and Samar\r\nwho collected thousands of followers, might produce a general\r\ninsurrection. He therefore took due precautions, and invited all\r\nthe Spaniards in the Philippines, without distinction of party, in\r\nsupport of the Government constituted in Spain. There was, however,\r\nmuch agitation and much travelling to and fro amongst the native\r\nclergy and the pettifogging lawyers. It was, however, not till 1872\r\nthat the conspirators succeeded in producing the mutiny of Cavite,\r\nwhich was quickly suppressed, with much slaughter of the mutineers.\r\n\r\nThe chief amusement of the Tagal is cock-fighting. I shall not\r\ndescribe this well-known sport, but will remark that it provides no\r\ninconsiderable revenue. The right of building and running the cock-pits\r\nof each province is farmed out to Chinese or Chinese half-breeds,\r\nand no combats may take place except in these places. They are\r\nopened after Mass on Sundays and feast-days, and on some other days\r\nby special leave from the authorities. The love of this sport and the\r\nhope of gain is so general that the majority of the natives of Manila\r\nare breeders of game-cocks, which they tend with assiduous care, and\r\nartisans often carry their favourite birds to their work and tether\r\nthem in the shade, where they can keep them in view. Horse-fights\r\noccasionally take place. The ponies of the Philippines, although\r\nnot usually vicious to man, will fight savagely with each other, and\r\ninflict severe bites. I remember a case where two ponies harnessed to\r\na victoria began fighting and a Guardia Civil attempted to separate\r\nthem, when one of the ponies seized him by the thigh, lifted him\r\noff his feet, and shook him as a terrier might shake a rat; the\r\nflesh of the man's thigh was torn away and the bone left bare. This\r\ndreadful wound caused his death. The occurrence took place in front\r\nof the church of Binondo in Manila. Bull fights have been an utter\r\nfailure in Manila, although many attempts have been made to establish\r\nthem. Flying kites is a great amusement with young and old in the\r\nearly months of the year, when the N.E. monsoon blows. Fights are\r\norganised: the competing kites have crescent-shaped pieces of steel\r\nattached to the tails, and the competitor who can cut the string of\r\nhis opponent's kite by causing his own to swoop suddenly across it,\r\nis the winner. Betting on the result is common. The Tagals are also\r\nfond of the theatre, and some years ago there was a Tagal theatre in\r\nBinondo where comedies in that language were played. I have also met\r\nstrolling players in the country towns.\r\n\r\nBut of all kinds of shows a good circus is the one that fetches his\r\nlast dollar out of the Tagal. Guiseppe Chiarini reaped a silver harvest\r\nin Manila on both occasions he pitched his tents there. His advance\r\nagent, Maya, a Chilian, paved the way for success, and the pompous\r\nannouncement that Chiarini was born in the sacred city of Rome, greatly\r\nimpressed the natives, who flocked in thousands to his circus. Chiarini\r\nconsidered himself able to tame the most vicious horse, and purchased\r\na fine Manila pony that no one could manage. The beast, however,\r\nwas not subdued by his powers, and, seizing the tamer's cheek, bit\r\noff a large piece.\r\n\r\nOn feast days in the larger towns, open-air plays are sometimes\r\ngiven, and what with preparations, rehearsals, and performance,\r\nabsorb the attention of a large number of the inhabitants for a\r\ncouple of months. I witnessed a very notable performance of this\r\nkind some years ago at Balayan in the province of Batangas, the\r\ncharacters being played by the sons and daughters of the principal\r\npeople there. The subject was taken from the 'Wars of Grenada.' In\r\nthe first act we saw a Christian king and his court, also his only\r\nand peerless daughter. After these had had their say, an ambassador\r\nfrom the Moslem king was announced, and the king summoned his council\r\nto consider the communication. He took his seat upon the throne,\r\nwith grey-bearded councillors on each side. The Moslem envoy, and his\r\nsuite and escort, entered on horseback and very unnecessarily galloped\r\nabout and gave an exhibition of their horsemanship. Then the envoy,\r\nstill on horseback, harangued the king, and arrogantly demanded the\r\nhand of the beauteous princess for his master, threatening war to\r\nthe knife in case of refusal. He then retired to his camp.\r\n\r\nNext came the discussion of the demand which the grey-beards think\r\nit hopeless to resist. The Moslem envoy was sent for, and amid great\r\ngrief the princess was about to be confided to his care, when there\r\nrushed in a young Christian warrior and his followers, who swore they\r\nwould never allow a Christian princess to wed a Paynim, and dismissed\r\nthe envoy with contumelious remarks. He retired vowing vengeance. All\r\nthis occupied a long time, and I did not remain for the rest. I think\r\nit took two days to act. But from the volleys of musketry and firing\r\nof rockets and mortars which I heard, a sanguinary war must have been\r\nwaged and many of the characters must have perished. The play was\r\nacted in a more spirited way than usual; some of the male performers\r\ndeclaimed their parts with energy. Some were mounted on fine ponies,\r\nand were well got up and armed.\r\n\r\nThe girls' dresses were rich, and they wore a great deal of\r\njewellery. Some of the princesses were very handsome girls. There is a\r\nsort of a superstition that any girl performing in one of these pieces\r\nis sure to be married within a year. This makes them very ready to\r\nundertake a part, as they obtain an excellent opportunity to display\r\ntheir charms to advantage, and so help to fulfil the prediction. The\r\nplay was witnessed by the mass of the population of Balayan and by\r\nnumerous visitors from the neighbouring towns. It was considered a\r\nvery successful performance, and it carried my memory over the wide\r\nPacific to Peru, where I have seen similar plays acted by the country\r\npeople in the Plaza of Huacho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTagal Literature.\r\n\r\nTagal literature does not amount to very much, and the policy of\r\nthe Government of late years has been to teach Spanish as well as\r\nthe native dialects in the schools. This did not meet the approval\r\nof the old school of priests; but many of the younger ones have\r\naccepted the Government view. In the Exhibition of the Philippines,\r\nMadrid, 1887, Don Vicente Barrantes showed twenty volumes of grammars\r\nand vocabularies of the Philippine dialects, and thirty-one volumes\r\nof popular native poetry, besides two volumes of native plays. The\r\nReverend Father Raimundo Lozano exhibited twenty-eight volumes of\r\nreligious works in the Visayas-Panayano dialect, and the Reverend\r\nFather Francisco Valdez a study of the roots of the Ilocan dialect\r\nin manuscript. Many works in the native dialects have been written by\r\nthe Spanish priests, such as one by the Reverend Father Manuel Blanco,\r\nthe learned author of the 'Flora Filipina,' of which I give the title\r\nand the first verse:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tagaloc verses to assist in     \"Manga dalit na Tagalog at\r\n    dying well.                     pagtulong sa mamaluatay na\r\n                                    tanang Cristiana.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nManila, 1867, VIII., 62 pag 8o.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"Aba bumabasa baquin baga caya\r\n            Tila camuntima i nata cang bohala.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI now give the title of a secular poem in English and Tagal, that\r\nthe reader may compare the words and note the subject:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Story of the life of the    \"Salita at buhay nang\r\n        beauteous shepherdess       marilang na pastora na si\r\n        Jacobina, a native of       Jacobina tubo sa Villa\r\n        Moncada, who became the     Moncada Naguing asaua\r\n        wife of the King,           nang Policarpio de\r\n        Policarpio de Villar,       Villar sa cabarian nang\r\n        in the kingdom of           Dalmacia nagga roon nang\r\n        Dalmatia, and bore a        isang supligna anac ang\r\n        son named Villardo.         pangaia i si Villardo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poem begins--\r\n\r\n            \"O maamong Ester mananalong Judit\r\n            Mariang linanag nitong sang daigdig.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand concludes--\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"Panang nang pupuri ang lahat nang cabig\r\n            Sa yanang inaguling ang tinamo i sangit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not think it is necessary to quote any more, as this gives the\r\nreader sufficient idea of the language.\r\n\r\nThere is much that is good in the Tagal, much to like and\r\nadmire. Antonio de Morga, Sinibaldo de Mas, Tomas de Comyn, Paul de la\r\nGironiere, Jagor, Bowring, Palgrave, Foreman, Stevens, Worcester--all\r\nhave some good to say of him, and with reason. But the piratical\r\nblood is strong in him yet. He requires restraint and guidance from\r\nthose who have a higher standard for their actions than he has. Left\r\nto himself he would infallibly relapse into savagery. At the same\r\ntime he will not be governed by brute force, and under oppression\r\nor contumelious treatment he would abandon the plains, retire to the\r\nmountains, and lead a predatory life. Although not just himself nor\r\ntruthful, he can recognise and revere truth and justice in a master\r\nor governor. Courageous himself, only a courageous man can win his\r\nrespect. He is grateful, [25] and whoever can secure his reverence\r\nand gratitude will have no trouble in leading him.\r\n\r\nI have testified to the Tagal's excellence in many handicrafts and\r\ncallings, yet I greatly doubt whether they have the mental and moral\r\nequipment for any of the professions. I should not like to place my\r\naffairs in the hands of a Tagal lawyer, to trust my life in the hands\r\nof a Tagal doctor, nor to purchase an estate on the faith of a Tagal\r\nsurveyor's measurement.\r\n\r\nI do not say that they are all untrustworthy, nor that they can never\r\nbecome fit for the higher callings, but they are not fit for them\r\nnow, and it will take a long time, and a completely changed system\r\nof education, before they can become fit.\r\n\r\nWhat they want are examples of a high type of honour and morality that\r\nthey could look up to and strive to imitate. There are such men in\r\nAmerica. Whether they will be sent to the Philippines is best known\r\nto Mr. McKinley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nPampangos (2).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pampangos are close neighbours of the Tagals. They inhabit the\r\nrich and fertile province of Pampanga and a large part of that of\r\nTarlac. There are also some detached colonies of them in the towns\r\nof Bataan, Nueva Ecija, Pangasinan, and Zambales. The population of\r\nPampanga is given in the census of 1876 as 226,000. Allowing one-half\r\nthe population of Tarlac to belong to this race, we have to add\r\n41,000, and supposing one-tenth the population of Bataan, Nueva Ecija,\r\nand Zambales, to be Pampangos, say 27,000, we get 294,000 as their\r\nnumber in 1876. Doubtless they have largely increased since then. The\r\nPampangos speak a different language from the Tagals, yet they can\r\nunderstand each other to some extent. Many of the better class speak\r\nboth languages. The Pampango does not greatly differ from the Tagal in\r\nappearance or character, but his environment and his occupations are\r\ndifferent. He is not so much a sailor, a fisherman, or a mechanic. He\r\nexcels in agriculture, is a good organiser of labour, rides well,\r\nis a good hunter, and makes a bold and determined soldier. Large\r\nnumbers of this war-like race have fought under the Spanish flag\r\nagainst the Mahometan princes of the Moluccas, of Mindanao, and Sulu,\r\nas also against the British and the Dutch.\r\n\r\n\r\nPampangos as Cultivators.\r\n\r\nThe towns of San Fernando, Guagua Bacolor, Mexico, Angeles, Candaba,\r\nand many others have been built up by Pampanga industry. They contain\r\nmany fine houses, where the European traveller is sure of a hospitable\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nThe staple crop of Pampanga is sugar, and I shall explain their\r\norganisation for its cultivation and manufacture.\r\n\r\nIn Luzon the land is usually cultivated under an arrangement known\r\nas Aparceria.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of Aparceria vary according to the locality, and to\r\nestablished custom, since on the land near a town a smaller share is\r\ngiven to the cultivator than on land near the forests, where if he\r\nwere not satisfied he might commence to clear land for himself. Also\r\nthe land near the towns is more valuable than that at a distance for\r\nvarious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of the terms usual in Pampanga. The\r\nland-owner provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A. Cleared land ready for the plough.\r\n    B. Sugar-cane points for the first planting.\r\n    C. Sugar-mill, boiling-pans and the building for same.\r\n    D. Money advances to keep the cultivator and his family, and for\r\n       taking off the crop.\r\n    E. Carts for carrying the cane to the mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cultivator, or inquilino, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. His labour and that of his family for ploughing, planting and\r\n       cultivating the cane and fencing the plantations.\r\n    2. The ploughs and implements of husbandry.\r\n    3. The cattle (water buffaloes) for the above labours and for\r\n       working the mill if it is a cattle mill.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe money advanced to the cultivator by the land-owner is charged 20\r\nper cent. per annum interest.\r\n\r\nFor a daily task of 9 pilones from cattle-mills or 10 pilones from\r\nsteam-mills there are employed:\r\n\r\n\r\n    2 Labourers to cut cane      at 25 cents and food    .50 cents.\r\n    1 Carter                     at 25 cents and food    .25\r\n    2 Mill attendants            at 25 cents and food    .50\r\n    Sugar boiler and fireman     at 25 cents and food    .75\r\n    1 Megass carrier             at 25 cents and food    .25\r\n                                                       ------\r\n    Mexican dollars                                     2.25\r\n\r\n                                             Or 25 cents per pilon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSugar Crop.\r\n\r\nThe land-owner pays the men's wages, and the cultivator gives them\r\nthree meals a day and cigars.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-moulds (pilones) cost about 121/2 cents each, and the cost\r\nis divided between the parties.\r\n\r\nIn making up the account, 61/2 per cent. per annum is charged on the\r\nvalue of the land, machinery and building.\r\n\r\nThe molasses which drains from the sugar belongs to the land-owner.\r\n\r\nThese pilones are supposed to contain 140 lbs. of sugar when\r\nfilled. They are placed upon a small pot to allow the molasses to drain\r\noff. When delivered their weight may be from 112 to 120 lbs. according\r\nto the time they have been draining. This sugar polarises about 80\r\nper cent. according to circumstances and requires to be treated at\r\nthe farderias in Manila to bring it up to an even sample before it\r\nis exported. The sugar loaves are cut up, sorted, crushed, mixed\r\nwith other sugars, sun-dried, and a certain quantity of sand added\r\nbefore being put into bags for export as Manila Sugar, usually No. 7\r\nor No. 9 Dutch standard. It will be seen from the above figures how\r\nmoderate the expenses are. Of course each land-owner has a number of\r\ncultivators, and often a number of mills.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the low price of sugar which has prevailed for many\r\nyears, the provinces of Pampanga has made money out of it as the\r\nhandsome houses of the land-owners in all their towns testify.\r\n\r\nThe sugar crop in Pampanga has never quite reached a million pilones,\r\nbut has exceeded nine hundred thousand, say from fifty to sixty\r\nthousand English tons. The cane is crushed in small steam or cattle\r\nmills having three horizontal rollers.\r\n\r\nThese mills are mostly made in Glasgow and have now in Pampanga\r\nentirely superseded the Chinese mills with vertical rollers of granite\r\nor the native mills with vertical rollers of hard wood. [26]\r\n\r\nIn former years I pointed out, in a report written for General\r\nJovellar, what a great advantage it would be to Pampanga if the\r\nplanters would abandon the use of pilones and make sugar suitable\r\nfor direct export and so obviate the manipulation in the farderias\r\nat Manila.\r\n\r\nThey could make a sugar similar to that produced in Negros and known\r\nas Ilo-ilo.\r\n\r\nNow that the Philippines have passed into the hands of the United\r\nStates, I do not doubt that central sugar factories will be established\r\nand will turn out centrifugal sugars polarizing 96 per cent. similar\r\nto the Cuban sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPampangos as Fishermen.\r\n\r\nThere are some Pampanga fishermen on the River Betis, at San Jose,\r\nand amongst the labyrinth of creeks and mangrove swamps forming the\r\nnorth-western shores of Manila Bay.\r\n\r\nTheir avocation is not destitute of danger, for these swamps are\r\nthe home of the alligator. [27] Although they are not as large as\r\nsome I have seen in the River Paraguay or on the River Daule, in\r\nEcuador, they are quite large enough to seize a horse or a man. I\r\nwas once visiting Fr. Enrique Garcia, the parish priest of Macabebe,\r\nwhen a native woman came in and presented him with a dollar to say\r\na Mass in thanksgiving for the escape of her husband from death that\r\nmorning. She told us that he was pushing a shrimp-net in shallow water\r\nwhen the buaya seized him by the shoulder. The fisherman, however,\r\ncalled upon his patron saint, and putting out his utmost strength,\r\nwith the aid of Saint Peter, succeeded in extricating himself from\r\nthe reptile's jaws and in beating him off. His shoulder, however,\r\nwas badly lacerated by the alligator's teeth. It was lucky for him\r\nthat he was in shallow water, for the alligator usually holds its\r\nprey under water and drowns it.\r\n\r\nThe Pampangos also fish on the Rio Grande, the Rio Chico, and in the\r\nPinag de Candaba. This latter is an extensive swampy plain, partly\r\nunder cultivation in the dry season, partly laid out as fish-ponds.\r\n\r\nThe Nipa palm grows in abundance in the delta of the Betis, and\r\nsmall colonies of half-savage people are settled on dry spots amongst\r\nthese swamps engaged in collecting the juice or the leaves of this\r\ntree. The stems are punctured and the juice runs into small vessels\r\nmade of cane. It is collected daily, poured into jars and carried in\r\nsmall canoes to the distillery where it is fermented and distilled.\r\n\r\nThe distilleries are constructed in a very primitive manner, and are\r\nworked by Chinese or Chinese half-breeds.\r\n\r\nThe produce is called Vino de Nipa, and is retailed in the native\r\nstalls and restaurants.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are doubled and sewn with rattan strips upon a small piece\r\nof bamboo, they are taken to market upon a platform laid across the\r\ngunwales of two canoes. This arrangement is called bangcas mancornadas,\r\ncanoes yoked together. The nipa is sold by the thousand, and serves to\r\nthatch the native houses anywhere, except in certain parts of Manila\r\nand other towns where its use is forbidden on account of the great\r\ndanger of its taking fire.\r\n\r\nFrom circumstances that have come under my own observation, I believe\r\nit to be a fact that when trade in nipa thatch is dull, the canoe-men\r\nset fire to the native houses in the suburbs of Manila to make a\r\nmarket. I have noticed more than once that houses have commenced to\r\nburn from the upper part of the thatched roof where they could not\r\nhave caught fire accidentally. The Province of Pampanga extends to\r\nthe westward, as far as the crests of the Zambales mountains, and the\r\nCordillera of Mabanga is included within its boundaries. There is but\r\nlittle cultivated land beyond the town of Porac to the westward. Here\r\nthe Pampangos trade with the Negritos, who inhabit the Zambales range,\r\ngetting from them jungle produce in exchange for rice, tobacco, sugar,\r\nand other articles. Occasionally the Negritos steal cattle from\r\nthe Pampangos or at times murder one of them if a good opportunity\r\npresents itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPampangos as Hunters.\r\n\r\nThe natives of this part of the province are good wood-men and hunters.\r\n\r\nIn addition to taking game by nets and ambuscade, some of them hunt\r\nthe deer on ponies which are trained to run at full speed after the\r\ngame, up or down hill, and to get near enough for the rider to throw\r\nor use his lance.\r\n\r\nBeing at Porac in 1879 with the late Major Deare, 74th Highlanders\r\n(now 2nd Batt. Highland Light Infantry), an enthusiastic sportsman,\r\nwe saw two men who had practised this sport for years, and were told\r\nthat their arms, ribs, legs and collar-bones had been broken over and\r\nover again. We saw them gallop down a rocky and precipitous descent\r\nafter a deer at full speed.\r\n\r\nWe could only wonder that they were alive if that was a sample of\r\ntheir hunting. Their saddles were fitted with strong martingales and\r\ncruppers and with triple girths so that they could not shift. The\r\nsaddles themselves were of the usual native pattern, like miniature\r\nMexicans. The men were light weights.\r\n\r\nN.B.--If any reader of this contemplates travelling in the\r\nPhilippines, let him take a saddle with him. It should be as small\r\nas he could comfortably use, and light. The ponies are from twelve\r\nto thirteen hands high, but are remarkably strong and clever. I know\r\nfrom experience that a good one will carry fourteen stone over rough\r\nground with safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTulisanes.\r\n\r\nPampanga has produced some notable bandits or Tulisanes who have given\r\nthe Spaniards much trouble. Of late years there has been a diminution\r\nin the number of crimes of violence, due in a great measure to the\r\nestablishment of the Guardia Civil by General Gandara in 1867.\r\n\r\nI once built a nipa house on the banks of the Rio Grande, near\r\nMacabebe, and resided there for several months, carrying on some\r\nworks. I was new to the country and ignorant of the customs of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThere were no other Europeans in the vicinity, except the priests.\r\n\r\nI took care to treat all my native neighbours with strict justice,\r\nneither infringing their rights, nor allowing them to impose on me.\r\n\r\nThere came to stay with me Mr. A. B. Whyte, then an employe, now a\r\npartner in one of the leading British firms in Manila, who frequently\r\nhad ten thousand dollars in gold in his safe, and similar sums were\r\nremitted to him from Manila at different times for the purchase\r\nof sugar.\r\n\r\nOne day we received a visit from an officer of the Civil Guard who came\r\nto warn us that we were in danger of an attack, that his post was too\r\nfar off for him to protect us, and that the locality bore a very bad\r\nname for crimes of violence. We thanked him for his visit and warning,\r\nentertained him to lunch, and informed him that we intended to remain,\r\nafter which he returned to his post at Apalit. On making inquiry we\r\nfound that some of our immediate neighbours were well-known bandits,\r\nbut were thought to have retired from business. However, they never\r\nattacked us, and probably prevented any other Tulisanes from doing so\r\nlest they should get the blame. But had I encroached on their land or\r\ntreated them contemptuously, or had I allowed them to impose upon me,\r\nI do not doubt we should have been attacked and to say the least we\r\nmight have found ourselves in a tight place.\r\n\r\nA nipa house is no place to defend, for it can be burnt in a few\r\nminutes in the dry season, and a spear can be pushed through the sides,\r\nor up through the floor with ease.\r\n\r\nIn cases like this one cannot entirely depend upon the assistance\r\nof native servants, for they have sometimes joined with criminals to\r\nrob or murder their master.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious custom amongst bandits to invite an outsider to\r\njoin them in a particular enterprise, and it is considered mean and as\r\ndenoting a want of courage to refuse, even when a servant is invited\r\nto help rob or kill his master. Moreover, there is much danger in\r\nrefusing to join the bandits, for it will give dire offence to them and\r\nperhaps have fatal consequences. This invitation is called a Convite\r\n[see Chap. V.].\r\n\r\nThe hereditary taint of piracy in the Malay blood, and the low\r\nmoral standard prevailing in the Archipelago, as well as fear of the\r\nconsequences of a refusal, render it more difficult than a stranger\r\ncan realise for a native servant to resist such a temptation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPampanga Women.\r\n\r\nThe women in Pampanga are smart in appearance, clever in business,\r\nand good at a bargain, whether buying or selling. The men are well\r\naware of this and when selling their produce or buying a sugar-mill,\r\nthey like to have the assistance of their wives, who are always the\r\nhardest customers to deal with.\r\n\r\nThey are excellent sempstresses and good at embroidery. In some\r\nvillages they make very durable silk handkerchiefs with coloured\r\nborders of blue, red or purple. Straw hats, mats, salacots, cigar\r\nand cigarette cases are also made by them.\r\n\r\nTheir houses are kept clean, and the larger ones are well-suited for\r\nentertainments, as the sala and caida are very spacious, and have\r\npolished floors of narra, or some other hard close-grained wood very\r\npleasant to dance on.\r\n\r\nA ball at a big Pampanga house is a sight that will be\r\nremembered. Capitan Joaquin Arnedo Cruz of Sulipan, on the Rio Grande,\r\na wealthy native sugar-planter, used to assemble in his fine house the\r\nprincipal people of the neighbourhood to meet royal or distinguished\r\nguests. One of his daughters is married to a distinguished lawyer,\r\nmy friend Don Felipe Buencamino, author of the remarkable State\r\npaper addressed to the United States Senate, and published in the\r\nCongressional Record of January 9th, 1900, pp. 752-53-54. Capitan\r\nJoaquin possessed a magnificent porcelain table-service of two hundred\r\npieces, specially made and marked with his monogram, sent him by a\r\nprince who had enjoyed his hospitality.\r\n\r\nHe gave a ball for the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia, who afterwards\r\ndeclared that the room presented one of the most brilliant sights he\r\nhad ever seen.\r\n\r\nThis from a son of an Emperor might seem an exaggeration, but brilliant\r\nis the only word that can describe the effect produced on the spectator\r\nby the bright costumes and sparkling jewellery of the women.\r\n\r\nTheir dress seems to exercise a fascination upon Europeans which the\r\ncostume of any other eastern country fails to do.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Paul de la Gironiere, in his charming book, 'Vingt Ans aux\r\nPhilippines,' says, about the Mestiza dress: \"Nothing so charming,\r\nso coquet, so provocative as this costume which excites to the highest\r\npoint the admiration of all strangers.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that the women are well aware of this, and that on\r\nno account would they make a change. I will add my opinion that they\r\nare quite right, and may they ever stick to the saya, the baro, and\r\nthe tapis under the Stars and Stripes, may they ever be as natural,\r\nas handsome and as prosperous as when the writer dwelt amongst them\r\non the banks of the Rio Grande under the paternal rule of Alcalde\r\nMayor Don Jose Feced y Temprado.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nZambales (3).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Zambales are a small and unimportant tribe of the Malay race, with\r\nsome admixture of Negrito blood. They inhabit part of the province of\r\nZambales from the River Naja down to South Felipe, a coast village\r\nin 15 deg. N. latitude, and in their mountains there roam a good many\r\nNegritos. The Zambales are subjugated and converted to Christianity,\r\nbut some still maintain a partial independence amongst the mountains,\r\npaying, however, the \"Reconocimentio de Vassallaje.\" At the time of\r\nthe conquest, these people were famous head-hunters, and otherwise\r\nmanifested a bloodthirsty disposition. They lived in villages of\r\nthirty to forty families, quite independent of each other, and their\r\nchiefs possessed but little influence. When one of a family died the\r\nsurviving male relatives put on a black head-cloth or turban, which\r\nthey durst not remove until one of them had killed some one else so\r\nas to satisfy the death vengeance. A murder could be atoned for by a\r\npayment in gold or in goods, or a slave or Negrito might be delivered\r\nup to be sacrificed to the manes of the departed. It was customary\r\namongst them to take with them to their feasts the heads or skulls\r\nthey possessed. The heads were placed on poles and ceremonial dances\r\nwere performed around them. They also emulated the Vikings by making\r\ndrinking cups out of their enemies' skulls.\r\n\r\nTheir religion was similar to that of the Tagals. Their principal god\r\nwas called Malayari, but he had under him two deputy gods, Acasi and\r\nManglobag, and a large number of inferior gods. Their chief priest\r\nwas called Bayoc, and exercised great influence amongst them. They\r\ncelebrated baptism with the blood of a pig. Amongst them, as in\r\nBorneo and with many tribes of Malays who are not Mahometans, the\r\npig is considered as the most acceptable sacrifice to the gods. For\r\nparticulars about this I refer the reader to 'Life in the Forests of\r\nthe Far East,' by Spenser St. John.\r\n\r\nNow, at last, they have been brought into the Christian fold,\r\nthough, perhaps, amongst the pine-clad mountains, heathen customs\r\nmaintain their hold upon the wild hillmen. These latter trade with\r\ntheir Christian and partly-civilised brethren, bringing them jungle\r\nproduce, tobacco, and the small bezoar stones, so highly prized\r\nby the Chinese, in return for articles they require. The Zambales\r\nraise some rice and a little sugar. Their trade is inconsiderable,\r\ntheir exports being limited to Sapan wood, jungle produce, timber,\r\nfire-wood, and charcoal, all of which is shipped to Manila, where it\r\nfinds a ready sale. The total population of this province was 94,551\r\nin 1876, but only a portion of these were Zambales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPangasinanes (4).\r\n\r\nThe Pangasinanes inhabit the north-western part of the province of\r\nPangasinan, and the northern part of the province of Zambales from\r\nthe River Naja, which runs into the Bay of Bazol, round Cape Bolinao\r\nto Sual, including the Island of Cabarruyan and Santiago. But the\r\nsouthern and eastern part of their province is partly inhabited by\r\nPampangos and Ilocanos.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some Pangasinanes scattered about the\r\nnorthern part of Nueva Ecija amongst Tagals and Ilocanos, and there\r\nare a few as colonists in Benguet.\r\n\r\nIn former times the Pangasinanes occupied a wider extent of\r\ncountry. When Juan Salcedo arrived he found them occupying the southern\r\npart of La Union; but they have been and are still being pushed back\r\nby the more hard working and energetic Ilocanos.\r\n\r\nAs the limits of their province do not correspond to the ethnographical\r\nboundaries, it is not easy to estimate their numbers. I think there\r\nmay be about 300,000 of them.\r\n\r\nThe Pangasinanes were subjugated by the Spaniards in 1572, and in\r\n1576 they were all Christians. Their manners and customs are similar\r\nto those of the Pampangos and Tagals, but they have a rougher and\r\nmore uncouth appearance. Their chief occupation is cultivating rice,\r\nand whenever this is the case the people are poor and little advanced\r\nin civilisation. It is the lowest kind of agriculture any people\r\ncan follow. The first sign of prosperity in an eastern people is\r\ngiven when they begin to import rice, as it shows that they have\r\na more remunerative occupation to follow than cultivating it for\r\nthemselves. Thus the Cagayanes who grow tobacco, the Pampangos who\r\ngrow sugar, and the Vicols of Albay and neighbouring islands who grow\r\nhemp, all import rice.\r\n\r\nMr. J. W. Jamieson, the Acting British Consul at Sumao, in a report on\r\nthe trade of Yunnan, issued the 7th of December, 1898, says: \"Apart\r\nfrom minerals, the province possesses a few other resources and the\r\ninhabitants are lazy and unenterprising to a degree. So long as they\r\ncan grow enough rice to feed themselves and procure enough cotton to\r\nmake the few articles of clothing necessary in this equable climate,\r\nthey are content.\"\r\n\r\nI am glad to find this confirmation of my views in this\r\nmatter. Mr. Jamieson's remarks apply to all the rice-growers I\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nThe rice is raised in the delta of the Agno and about that\r\nriver. Formerly, the Pangasinanes not only sent rice to Manila,\r\nbut exported it to China, Siam, and Annan.\r\n\r\nFor this trade they built their own vessels at Lingayen, and in the\r\nflourishing period, some twenty-five years ago, their shipwrights used\r\nto turn out eight or ten schooners in a year, vessels able to carry\r\n300 to 400 tons dead weight. Since the introduction of steamers into\r\nthe coasting trade, the construction of sailing vessels has greatly\r\ndiminished. Still, they turn out two or three a year.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the province they make sugar, but it will not compare\r\nin quality with that made in Pampanga. It has a smaller grain and a\r\npaler colour, but less sweetening power. The average of thirty samples,\r\ntaken as the sugar was ladled out of the tacho, was--\r\n\r\n\r\n            Crystallizable sugar        70.40 per cent.\r\n            Uncrystallizable            13.00\r\n            Ash                          1.97\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is drained in pilones, or earthenware moulds; but, unlike the\r\nPampanga custom, the moulds are not delivered with the sugar, but\r\nthe leaf is wrapped in the dried sheaths of the palm, tied about\r\nwith split rattan. Most of the sugar is sent by sea to Manila and\r\nexported to China for direct consumption in one of the provinces\r\nwhere it finds a ready sale.\r\n\r\nIndigo was formerly cultivated here and exported, and at one time\r\na good deal of Sapan wood was also exported, but the trade in these\r\narticles has almost ceased.\r\n\r\nAmongst the industries of Pangasinan may be mentioned the manufacture\r\nof hats, hundreds of thousands of which were made at Calasiao from\r\ngrass or nito, and sent to Boston or New York. There are also at\r\nCalasiao, and in some other towns, blacksmiths who forge excellent\r\nbolos or wood-knives from the iron-bands taken off bales of cotton\r\ncloth or sacking.\r\n\r\nCarromatas, the two-wheeled vehicles of the country, are constructed\r\nin Lingayen and Dagupan, and are said to be very well made.\r\n\r\nI may mention here that the ponies raised in these provinces are\r\ninferior to the Ilocanos or even the Albay breed.\r\n\r\nThe sands of the River Agno near Rosales, and of the streams coming\r\ndown from Mount Lagsig, are washed for gold, principally by women\r\nwho obtain but a meagre return.\r\n\r\nThe civilisation of the Pangasinanes is only skin-deep, and one of\r\ntheir characteristics is a decided propensity to remontar, that is,\r\nto abandon their towns or villages and take to the mountains, out of\r\nreach of all authority. There are some great land-owners in Pangasinan;\r\none of them, Don Rafael Sison, owns an estate that stretches from\r\nCalasiao and Santa Barbara to Urdaneta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIlocanos (5).\r\n\r\nThis hard-working and industrious race occupies the northern and\r\nwestern shores of Luzon, from Point Lacatacay on the 121st meridian,\r\neast from Greenwich, to San Fabian, on the Gulf of Lingayen. This\r\nincludes the three provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, and La\r\nUnion. The Ilocanos have also pushed into the north-eastern part of\r\nPangasinan, where they occupy seven towns, and they inhabit the town\r\nof Alcala in the province of Cagayan, several villages in Benguet,\r\nparts of the towns of Capas and O'Donnell in the provinces of Tarlac,\r\nand some towns in Zambales and Nueva Ecija. They are all civilised\r\nand have been Christians for three centuries. Amongst them dwell many\r\nconverted Tinguianes and Igorrotes, who speak the Ilocan dialect.\r\n\r\nBlumentritt attributes the energy and activity of the Ilocanos to an\r\nadmixture, even though it be small, of these brave and hardy races. In\r\ndress and appearance they are similar to the Tagals, and like them\r\ncarry the indispensable bolo. They cultivate tobacco, cotton, rice,\r\nmaize, indigo, sugar-cane, and a little cacao and coffee. They also\r\ngrow the pita (Agave Americana), which gives the fibre for the nipis\r\ntextiles, ajonjoli (Sesamum indicum, L.), from which they extract oil,\r\nwhich is used in medicine and for the hair, and they even grow some\r\nwheat. They extract a black resin from the Antong (Canarum Pimela),\r\nwhich is used as incense or for making torches; another resin from\r\nthe Bangad, which is used as a varnish, another from the Cajel (Citrus\r\nAurantium), and many others used either in medicine, for torches, for\r\nvarnishing, or for paying the seams of wooden vessels. They get gum\r\nfrom the Balete (Ficus Urostigma), and from the Lucban, or orange tree\r\n(Citrus decumana, L.), oil from the Palomaria (Calophyllum inophyllum,\r\nL.), and from a large number of other trees, some only known by the\r\nnative name, and the use of which is uncertain. They obtain dyes\r\nfrom many trees growing wild in the forests, amongst others from the\r\nTabungao (Jatropha Curcas, L.), the Lomboy (Eugenia Lambolana, Lam.),\r\nthe sibucao (Coesalpinia Sappan, L.). Their cultivation of indigo is\r\ndeclining, partly because the demand has diminished in consequence of\r\nthe introduction of chemical substitutes, and also because the Chinese,\r\ninto whose hands the whole produce of these provinces found its way,\r\nadulterated it so abominably as to discredit it altogether. Yet so\r\ngreat is the facility of Ilocan territory for growing indigo, that\r\nGregorio Sy Quia of Vigan exhibited in Madrid in 1887 no less than\r\nseventy-five different kinds of indigo, and seventy-five different\r\nseeds corresponding to the samples. At the same exhibition, no less\r\nthan twenty-four different kinds of rice were exhibited from Ilocos,\r\nand this by no means exhausts the list. Every kind has a distinctive\r\nname. The textile industry flourishes amongst these industrious\r\npeople. The Local Committee of Namagpacan, in the province of La\r\nUnion, sent to Madrid for the above-mentioned exhibition, no less\r\nthan 145 different textiles, whilst other towns sent looms and other\r\nimplements. Amongst the articles woven are quilts, cotton blankets\r\n(the celebrated Mantos de Ilocos), napkins and towels, and a great\r\nvariety of material for coats, trousers, women's dresses and other\r\nuses. Guingon (called by sailors dungaree), a blue stuff for clothing,\r\ncosts from $0.50 to $0.31, 2s. 8d. per vara (2 feet 9 inches),\r\na mixture of cotton and silk, for men's wear, $1.25 per vara, silk\r\nhandkerchiefs $0.25 each.\r\n\r\nThe Ilocans also make nets for fish, and for deer and pigs; baskets\r\nof all sorts, salacots or hats.\r\n\r\nThey grow two kinds of cotton for textiles, the white and the\r\nCoyote. Another kind, a tree cotton from the Boboy (Eriodendron\r\nanfractuosum, D.C.), is only used for stuffing pillows. They extract\r\noil from the seeds of all three kinds.\r\n\r\nLike the other civilized natives they live principally on rice and\r\nfish, which they capture in large quantities. Blumentritt mentions\r\ntwo kinds, the \"Ipon\" and the \"Dolon,\" which they salt or pickle.\r\n\r\nThey have fine cattle, which they sell to the Igorrotes. It will\r\nbe noted that the Tinguianes, on the other hand, sell cattle to\r\nthe Ilocanos. The ponies of Ilocos are highly valued in Manila,\r\nwhere there is a great demand for them. They are smaller than the\r\nponies of other provinces, but are very hardy and spirited, and\r\ngo at a great pace. Tulisanes formerly infested these provinces\r\nand found a ready refuge in the mountains, when pursued by the\r\ncuadrilleros, or village constables, who were only armed with bolos,\r\nlances, and a few old muskets. But the creation of the Civil Guard,\r\nformed of picked officers and men, who were armed with Remingtons and\r\nrevolvers, and whose orders were, \"Do not hesitate to shoot,\" made this\r\nbusiness very dangerous, and the three provinces suffer little from\r\nbrigandage. When Juan Salcedo conquered the Ilocos, he found a caste\r\nof nobles amongst them who possessed all the riches of the country,\r\nand treated the cailanes, or serfs, with great rigour. Their tyranny\r\ncaused several bloody rebellions, and although at present matters in\r\nthis respect have improved, there is still room for complaint that\r\nthe people who do the work do not get a fair remuneration for it,\r\nthe rich man always endeavouring to keep the poor man in permanent\r\nindebtedness. In consequence of this, the Ilocanos are ever ready to\r\nemigrate, and besides the places I have mentioned, there are thousands\r\nof them in Manila and other parts of the islands. They easily obtain\r\nemployment either as servants, cultivators, or labourers, for they are\r\nsuperior in stamina to most of the civilised races, and in industry\r\nsuperior to them all.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that there is a great future before this hardy,\r\nenterprising, and industrious people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIbanags or Cagayanes (6).\r\n\r\nThe Ibanags inhabit the Babuyanes and Batanes Islands and the northern\r\ncoast of Luzon, from Point Lacaytacay to Punta Escarpada, and all\r\nthe country comprised between the Rio Grande and the summits of the\r\nSierra Madre as far south as Balasig.\r\n\r\nThey also hold the left bank of the river from the sea, right up to the\r\nconfluence of the River Magat for an average width of some five miles.\r\n\r\nThey are said to be the finest race and the most valiant men in the\r\nislands, and to have manfully resisted the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nHowever, they were conquered and converted to Christianity. From the\r\nyear 1781 they have been subjected to the worst form of slavery, the\r\nforced cultivation of tobacco. The detestable abuses brought into this\r\nsystem by the unblushing rascality of the agents of the treasury,\r\nbecame, finally, so glaring, and the condition of the Ibanags so\r\ndreadful, that, in 1882, the Governor-General, Moriones (see Chapter\r\n\"Spanish Government\"), forced the hand of Canovas and the royal family,\r\nwho desired to sell the monopoly, and this horrible slavery ceased,\r\nhaving lasted over a century, going from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nSince that date the condition of the Ibanags has greatly improved; they\r\nhave continued the cultivation of tobacco, and private enterprise has\r\ndone much to introduce the finest seed and to improve the cultivation\r\nand preparatory operations. The \"Compania Tabacalera de Filipinas,\"\r\na Franco-Catalan enterprise, has established the Haciendas of San\r\nAntonio, San Rafael, and Santa Isabel, in the district of Isabela.\r\n\r\nThey have built large warehouses in Tumauini and have agents in all\r\nthe principal towns.\r\n\r\nOn the river they have a stern-wheel steamer, the Antonio Lopez,\r\nand a number of steel-lighters for carrying down tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe tobacco is ready for transport in December and January. It is sent\r\ndown the river to Aparri, from whence it is shipped to Manila. In a\r\nnormal dry season (February to August), the river is navigable for\r\nsteamers of two feet draught up to Alcala, the trade of which town\r\nis not important; but that of Tuguegarao is so, and up to that point\r\nthe current is not strong.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Ibanags the distinction of noble and plebeian has been\r\nas strongly marked as amongst the Tagals, Pampangos, and Ilocanos,\r\nand the intense cupidity of the nobles, or rather usurers, which name\r\nbetter describes them, has led to many bloody outbreaks on the part\r\nof the oppressed and enslaved debtors.\r\n\r\nThe government has steadily encouraged the Ilocanos and others to\r\nsettle in Cagayan and plant tobacco, giving them free passages and\r\nadvances of money in the days of the monopoly.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the discontent of the Ibanags has led them\r\nto migrate to other provinces when possible, for the authorities\r\nprevented them from doing so by force when they could. They especially\r\nendeavoured to get to Manila, and I remember many years ago the\r\narrival of a starving and ragged band, who had tramped all the way\r\nfrom Isabela to Manila to escape from their cruel task-masters.\r\n\r\nHowever, things are better with them now, and I hope means will be\r\nfound under the Stars and Stripes to introduce a better system of\r\nfinance, and to curb the greed of the usurer, either by legislation\r\nor by competition on a fair and humane basis. The Ibanag language is\r\nspreading greatly amongst the hill-tribes around them as a commercial\r\nlanguage, just as Ilocano is spreading on the West Coast.\r\n\r\nUnder American influence an immense development of the provinces\r\nof Cagayan and Isabela may be expected in the near future, and the\r\nIbanags will doubtless benefit by this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nIgorrotes (7).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an important, and to me, the most interesting of the\r\nindependent or partly subdued races of the Philippines. They are a\r\nfine, hardy, industrious, and warlike race, well worth a great and\r\npatient effort to bring them within the pale of Christianity, and\r\nto advance the civilisation they have already attained. They are of\r\na dark bronze colour, with straight black and abundant hair, large\r\ndark eyes set rather obliquely as amongst Chinese. Their faces are\r\nbroad with high cheek-bones, the nose aquiline and the head large. The\r\nfeatures in general have a Mongolian cast, and a certain nasal twang\r\nin their speech resembles that of the Southern Chinese. The men have\r\ncapacious chests, showing good lung-power, their muscles well developed\r\nindicating great strength and ability to resist fatigue. The women\r\nhave also well-marked figures and rounded limbs. The fashions vary\r\nwith different tribes, but it is common to find both sexes wearing\r\ntheir hair cut in a fringe over the forehead, but reaching down to\r\nthe eyebrows, long enough at the sides to cover the ears, left long\r\nat the back of the head, where it is gathered up into a knot.\r\n\r\nThe Igorrotes of Lepanto wear beards, some of them are as thick\r\nas a Spaniard's, but the tribes farther South pull out, not only\r\ntheir beards, but all the hair on their bodies, except that of the\r\nhead. Their dress varies from a mere apron (Bahaque) when at work in\r\nthe fields, to an ornamental jacket very smartly cut and elaborate\r\nsword-belt when at war or on any full-dress occasion. These jackets are\r\nvery handsome and have stripes of blue, crimson and white. They wear\r\na variety of head-dresses, turban, Salacot or a kind of cocked-hat\r\nand feathers. Both men and women wear cloaks or plaids of bright\r\ncolours made of cotton. Although the word Igorrote has come to be\r\nalmost a generic name for the heathen Highlanders of North Luzon,\r\nit is here limited to those who dwell on the Western part of the\r\nCordillera Central, comprising the whole of the districts of Benguet\r\nand Lepanto, part of Bontoc and parts of the Provinces of La Union\r\nand Ilocos Sur. The sub-tribes Buriks and Busaos are included.\r\n\r\nTattooing is very general amongst them. In some districts you can\r\nhardly find a man or woman who has not a figure of the sun tattooed in\r\nblue on the back of the hand, for in Central Benguet they worship the\r\nsun. Some of them tattoo the breast and arms in patterns of straight\r\nand curved lines pricked in with a needle in indigo blue. The Busao\r\nIgorrotes, who live in the North of Lepanto, tattoo flowers on their\r\narms, and in war-dress wear a cylindrical shako made of wood or plaited\r\nrattan, and large copper pendants in their ears. These people do not\r\nuse the Talibon, and prefer the spear. The Burik Igorrotes tattoo\r\nthe body in a curious manner, giving them the appearance of wearing\r\na coat of mail. But this custom is probably now becoming obsolete,\r\nfor at least those of the Igorrotes who live near the Christian\r\nnatives are gradually adopting their dress and customs.\r\n\r\nWhite is the colour of mourning, as amongst the Moros of Mindanao and\r\nSulu. Both sexes are fond of personal ornaments, such as ear-rings,\r\ncollars, arm-rings, bangles, leg-rings and belts. Collars of\r\ncrocodiles' teeth are highly esteemed. In the long list of their\r\nmanufactures I shall enumerate their ornaments. Their arms are the\r\ntalibon, a short double-edged sword; the gayang, a javelin or assegai;\r\nand the aligua, a light axe, having a spike at the back opposite to\r\nthe cutting edge. After throwing their javelins, they rush on with\r\ntheir drawn swords, holding their shield, called a calata, on the\r\nleft arm. This is made of light wood and is long and narrow. With the\r\nexception of the shape of the shield their equipment is much like\r\nthat of the Roman Legionaries twenty centuries since. The aligua\r\nappears to be used, not as a fighting weapon, but to decapitate\r\ntheir fallen enemies and as a means of carrying the head home on a\r\nspike. Great rejoicings, with feasts and dances, were held after a\r\nsuccessful skirmish, and large quantities of liquor consumed. But the\r\nconstant pressure of the Spanish authority has in a great measure\r\nstopped these petty wars. They make a kind of beer called Basi by\r\nfermenting cane-juice, and another liquor, something like the chicha\r\nof the Peruvian Coast Indians, from rice. This latter is called\r\nbundang. They are great smokers, and make their own pipes of various\r\nmaterials. They appear not to have universally adopted the Malay\r\ncustom of chewing buyo. There is a settlement of Christian Igorrotes\r\non the coast of Ilocos Sur, close to the boundary of La Union,\r\nwhich has been established many years. But in general the Igorrotes\r\nhave steadily refused to embrace Christianity, and evidently do not\r\nwant to go to the same heaven as the Spaniards. The behaviour of the\r\ntroops led against them in 1881 by General Primo de Rivera doubtless\r\nconfirmed them in this repugnance. The expedition did not do much in\r\nthe way of fighting, Remingtons and mountain-guns failed to subdue\r\nthe bold mountaineers armed only with javelin and sword. The Spanish\r\nofficers and men, however, are reported to have abominably mishandled\r\nthe Igorrote women. For this ravishing foray the late King Alfonso\r\nXII. bestowed the title of Vizconde de la Union upon Primo de Rivera,\r\nand showered promotions and crosses upon his staff.\r\n\r\nThe Igorrotes live in villages with a population of three or four\r\nhundred souls. There is a chief to each, but the villages are\r\nnot organised into states, each being independent. The chief is\r\nsupposed to be chosen from the families called Mainguel, who have\r\ndistinguished themselves in war. As a matter of fact, the richest\r\nman usually becomes chief. The wealthy families vie with each other\r\nin the grand feasts which they give to all comers. The noble and\r\nthe illustrious guests are personally invited to these feasts, but\r\nthe common people assemble at beat of drum. The chief presides at the\r\nmeeting of the Bacuanes or nobles in whom are vested the village lands,\r\nand who direct its affairs.\r\n\r\nThe common people are in a kind of bondage to the nobles, and\r\ncultivate their lands for them. In Lepanto they are called cailianes\r\nas in Ilocos. Their houses are square, and similar to those of\r\nthe other natives in the outlying districts, being raised on posts\r\nabove the ground-level. A framework of bamboos is supported on four\r\ntrunks of trees, the roof is thatched with cogon (elephant grass)\r\nand the sides are closed in by canes, bamboos or pine planks. Each\r\nhouse stands in an enclosure of its own, strongly fenced with rough\r\nstones or posts. They are far inferior to the Christian natives\r\nin the arrangement of their houses. Instead of having a separate\r\nkitchen on a pantalan or raised platform, the fire is made in the\r\ncentre of the house, and the smoke finds its way out through a hole\r\nin the roof. The rafters and inside of the thatch is blackened by\r\nthe soot. They make no windows to their houses and only a small door,\r\nthe ladder to which is drawn up when they retire to rest. They are not\r\nclean in their persons, and neglect to wash their clothes, or clean\r\nthe interiors of their houses. They thus compare very unfavourably\r\nwith the Tagals as regards cleanliness, although, as we shall see,\r\nin some other respects they are greatly above them. Each village has\r\nits Town Hall, which they call the Balta-oa. This is where the Town\r\nCouncil assembles to settle the affairs of the community, to hear\r\nrequests for divorces, and to administer the law to offenders. Public\r\nfestivities also take place here.\r\n\r\nThey are monogamous, and have the highest respect for the holiness\r\nof the marriage tie. It is not absolutely indissoluble, but can be\r\ndissolved by the village council on serious grounds; but apparently\r\ndivorce is systematically discouraged, and the sacredness of marriage\r\nis upheld. In former times adulteresses were punished by beheading,\r\nbut more lenient views now prevail, and a good whipping is considered\r\nsufficient to meet the case. Generally death only dissolves the tie,\r\nand even then only partially, as re-marriage is difficult; for it is\r\nnot proper for the widow to marry again without the consent of her\r\nlate husband's family, which may not easily be obtained, and if she\r\ncontracts new ties, the children of her first marriage are removed from\r\nher control. On the other hand, Igorrote respectability requires that\r\na widower should entirely neglect his toilet and commune silently with\r\nhis grief for several years before taking to himself a new wife. Like\r\nmost heathen, they show the greatest respect and affection for their\r\nparents, and cherish them to their life's end.\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast with the license accorded to young girls by the\r\nTagals and Visayas, the Igorrotes carefully guard the chastity of their\r\ndaughters, and do not allow them to go about without a chaperon. The\r\nfather even often accompanies them on their excursions. When they\r\narrive at the age of puberty, the boys and girls are separated.\r\n\r\nIn each village there are two special buildings not too near each\r\nother. In one of these the girls sleep under the watchful guard of\r\na duenna, who looks after their morals, and in the other the youths\r\nunder the care of an elder. The youth caught violating the sanctity of\r\nthe damsels' dormitory, or the maiden who is detected in an intrigue,\r\nor shows signs of maternity, may expect a severe correction. They do\r\nnot seem to raise as many difficulties about the marriage of their\r\ndaughters as the Tagals do, and they do not make it a matter of a\r\nmercenary bargain. When a youth takes a fancy to a marriageable maiden\r\nof his own degree, he applies through his parents to the father of the\r\ngirl, and if he and his daughter look with favour on the proposal,\r\nthe young man is admitted to cohabit with the damsel. But if within\r\na certain period the girl does not show signs of succession, the\r\nwould-be bridegroom is sent about his business. On the other hand,\r\nif pregnancy is announced, the wedding takes place with all possible\r\nceremony, including an invocation of the Anitos or ancestral gods,\r\nfeasts and dances, which last eight or nine days, but the young couple\r\nare excused from attendance. The Igorrotes, in fact, openly recognise\r\na custom which is practised to a great extent in the agricultural\r\ndistricts of England and Scotland, with this difference, that the\r\nChristian youth in the latter countries often evades the marriage,\r\nwhile the heathen Igorrote carries out his engagement. I think,\r\non the whole, the heathen comes out best.\r\n\r\nAlthough so desirous of offspring, they like to have them come one\r\nat a time, and they consider it to be an evil omen when one of their\r\nwomen brings forth twins. In such a case the last born is handed over\r\nto whoever desires to adopt it. This is held to avert the omen and\r\nstraighten things out again.\r\n\r\nOf late years the establishment of forts with the Tagal or Visayas\r\ngarrisons in the Igorrote territory, and closer contact with Christians\r\ngenerally, have tended to demoralise the heathen, and, above all,\r\nto lower somewhat their lofty ideal of chastity.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Igorrotes of Lepanto, and those farthest removed from\r\nSpanish influence, when a man of position dies, a notification is\r\nsent to all his blood-relations, even though they reside at a great\r\ndistance, and the corpse is not buried until they have all arrived\r\nand have each taken the dead man's hand in theirs, inquiring of him\r\ntenderly why he has abandoned his family. All this time a great feast\r\nis going on outside the house, vast quantities of rice and meat are\r\nprovided and consumed, and an unlimited allowance of beer drunk by\r\nthe guests. The expense is often out of all proportion to the means\r\nof the family and perhaps involves them in debt for years.\r\n\r\nIn the Igorrote territory under Spanish influence this extravagance\r\nand delay of burial is discouraged. Some of the Igorrotes dry their\r\ndead over a fire in a similar way to the Tinguianes. The dead are\r\nburied in a sitting posture, after the manner of the Peruvian Indians,\r\nbut enclosed in coffins, which are placed in any small cave or cleft\r\nin the rocks, enlarged by hand if necessary. The Igorrotes believe\r\nin a Supreme Being, the creator and preserver; he is called Apo in\r\nBenguet, and Lu-ma-oig in Lepanto. The wife of Apo is called Bangan,\r\nthe daughter Bugan and the son Ubban. There are two inferior gods,\r\nCabigat and Suyan, these deities hold intercourse with mankind\r\nthrough the Anitos or ancestral spirits, some good, some evil,\r\nwho reward or chastise mankind in this life. They represent these\r\nspirits by roughly-carved idols of wood. Some of these idols are\r\nmale and others female. Occasionally the carving is of an obscene\r\nnature, and similar to some clay images I have seen taken from tombs\r\nin Peru. They practise family prayer, and the object of it is to\r\nsolicit the favour of the Anitos. Sometimes the will of the Anitos\r\nis declared through an old priestess called an Asitera, who receives\r\na fee for her pains. The ancestral spirits are more worshipped than\r\nthe gods. Poultry, swine, and dogs, may not be slaughtered except in\r\na sacrificial manner. There is a priest in every village called the\r\nManbunung who first consecrates the animal to the Anitos, and then\r\nkills it and returns it to the owner, reserving, however, the best\r\npiece for himself. In company with his first-born son he takes the\r\nlead at prayer-meetings, or on special occasions, such as illness,\r\nmarriage, the commencing some important work, or averting some evil\r\nomen. This man makes some pretence at healing the sick, but rather\r\nwith charms and incantations than by administering medicine. There\r\nis a sacred tree near each village, which is regarded as the seat of\r\nthe Anitos. In the shade of this is a sacrificial stone. Sometimes\r\nnear a house may been seen a small bench for the Anitos to repose on,\r\nand a dish of rice or other food for their refreshment. The Igorrotes\r\nbelieve that there are two places where the souls of the dead travel\r\nto. One is an agreeable residence provided with everything necessary\r\nto happiness, and is for the spirits of those who have died a natural\r\ndeath. But if they have been evil-doers, such as robbers or murderers,\r\nand have escaped due punishment on earth, they are punished here by\r\nthe other souls before being allowed to enjoy the advantages of the\r\nplace. But the souls of brave warriors killed in battle, and of women\r\nwho have died in child-birth, arrive at a much more desirable place,\r\na real heaven, and reside amongst the gods.\r\n\r\nThe Igorrotes of Cabugalan in Lepanto regard eels as the embodiment\r\nof their ancestors; they will not catch them or do them any harm,\r\nbut feed them when opportunity offers. The Asiteras assist at feasts\r\nand make invocations and propose toasts which are drunk by the men\r\npresent. The private or family feasts are called Bumaguil, being\r\nheld in the giver's house or courtyard, but public entertainments or\r\nfeasts of the whole village are called Regnas, and are held in or in\r\nfront of the Balta-oa or Town Hall. They are preceded and followed\r\nby songs and dances. The songs are inharmonious and monotonous. The\r\ndances vary with the localities. In one dance bowing to the beer-mugs\r\nis a feature. As amongst other Malay races, ordeals are in fashion\r\nto decide disputes. One consists in a priest or chief scratching the\r\nscalps of the disputants with a small iron fork. Whoever loses most\r\nblood during this operation has lost his case. The Igorrotes work\r\nhard at their agriculture, and their rice-farming is excellent. They\r\nplough the valleys with the aid of buffaloes and terrace the hillsides,\r\nwhich they cultivate by hand. They burn down the pine-forests to clear\r\nthe hills. They irrigate where possible, carrying the canals over any\r\nravine by means of rude aqueducts. They grow considerable quantities\r\nof tobacco, [28] which is, however, of inferior quality. This they\r\nsell to the civilised natives, and it is exported. I suppose it goes\r\nto Hamburg to make German Havana cigars, just as conger eels go to\r\nParis to make fillets of soles. They cultivate sweet potatoes, also\r\nthe ordinary potatoes, which grow well, and although small, are much\r\nprized in Manila, and meet with a ready sale. The Igorrotes of Lepanto\r\neagerly seek new seeds to plant. It is strange that an agricultural\r\npeople like this should have little or no idea of breeding cattle, but\r\ninstead of doing so, they purchase from the Ilocanos and others cattle,\r\nhorses, and pigs for consumption, paying good prices for them. They\r\neven buy dogs to eat. I have been assured by Mr. Ernest Heald, formerly\r\nBritish Vice-Consul at Sual, that he has often seen Igorrotes returning\r\nto the hills from Dagupan, leading strings of dogs, which they had\r\npurchased for food at prices varying from twenty-five to fifty cents,\r\nand that the dogs seemed to have an instinctive idea what they were\r\nbeing taken away for. The cooking of the Igorrotes is abominable,\r\nespecially their way of cooking meat. It would not obtain the approval\r\nof Brillat Savarin. They seem to have no objection to eating it putrid,\r\nand their robust constitutions apparently prevent their suffering\r\nfrom ptomaine poisoning. The most remarkable characteristic of the\r\nIgorrotes is their skill as smiths, miners, and metallurgists. Their\r\nforges are not usually in their villages, but are hidden away in the\r\nforest; they use piston-blowers instead of bellows, and charcoal as\r\nfuel. Their lance-heads, swords, and other weapons are well shaped\r\nand of excellent quality. They worked the copper ores of Mancayen in\r\nLepanto very successfully. From official documents it appears that\r\nfrom 1840 to 1855 they sold on an average each year about nineteen\r\ntons of copper, either in ingots or manufactured. Then a Spanish\r\nCompany took up the work and ignominiously failed. Gold mining and\r\nwashing was formerly a monopoly of the nobles, and the washing is\r\nso still to some extent. For centuries, and long before the Spanish\r\nconquest, the Igorrotes have brought down gold to trade with the coast\r\nnatives. Such particulars as are known to me about Igorrote mining,\r\nsmelting, and gold-washing, will be found under the headings Gold,\r\nCopper, Iron, in Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\nI have added to this account of them a list of such of their\r\nmanufactures as I have seen or could learn of, and in most instances\r\nI have given the Igorrote name. The Igorrotes have several dialects,\r\nso that the names of the various articles may vary according to the\r\nlocality. Herewith a list of the dialects and the places where each\r\nis spoken, taken from Spanish official sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dialect.

In fifteen villages of that\r\n                                    Cordillera.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the Principales or head-men and others under Spanish influence\r\nspeak and write Ilocano, which they find necessary for their trade\r\nwith that people. More than twenty years ago there were seven schools\r\nin Lepanto regularly attended by five hundred and sixty-two children,\r\nof whom one hundred and ten could then read and write Spanish. No\r\ndoubt by this time these schools have considerably increased.\r\n\r\nI am much impressed by the great industry of these people and with the\r\ngreat skill they show in everything they undertake. It is therefore\r\ndisappointing to read in Foreman's book 'The Philippine Islands,'\r\np. 213: \"Like all the races of the Philippines, they are indolent to\r\nthe greatest degree.\" Foreman goes on to say, Polygamy seems to be\r\npermitted, murders are common, their huts are built bee-hive fashion,\r\nthey keep a Dr. and Cr. account of heads with the Negritos. All this\r\nis probably in consequence of accepting idle stories as facts, and\r\nis nothing less than a libel on the Igorrotes. A people who believe\r\nin a Supreme Being, Creator of heaven and earth, in the immortality\r\nof the soul, in an upper and lower heaven, in punishment after\r\ndeath, if it has been evaded in life, who are strict monogamists,\r\nand who have a high belief in the sacredness of the marriage tie;\r\na people who guard the chastity of their daughters as carefully as\r\nthe British or the Americans; a people physically strong, brave,\r\nskilful, and industrious, have nothing in common with the wretches\r\nForeman described under their name. These people live in the fairest\r\nand healthiest parts of Luzon, no fevers lurk amongst those pine-clad\r\nmountains, no sultry heats sap the vital powers. What an opportunity\r\nfor a grand missionary enterprise! What a noble material to work on,\r\nevery condition seems favourable. The very fact of their rejection of\r\nthe form of Christianity presented to them, and their distrust of the\r\nSpaniards, may influence them in favour of some simpler doctrine. I\r\nshall feel well repaid for my labour in describing these people,\r\nif the truthful picture I have attempted to present of them should\r\ninterest those who have the means and the will to inaugurate a new era,\r\nto help them along the Path. A perusal of what the old chroniclers say\r\nabout them convinces me that they have done much themselves to improve\r\ntheir moral condition, and that many detestable customs, at all events\r\nattributed to them, have long since been relegated to oblivion.\r\n\r\nI now give a list of the Missions in the Igorrote and Tinguian\r\nterritory that existed in 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Missions in Tinguian and Igorrote Territory.\r\n\r\n    1892.\r\n\r\n    Province.

They are now merged in the Pangasinanes,\r\nand have lost all distinctive customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbacas (12).\r\n\r\nA small tribe living about Caranglan in the South Caraballo. They were\r\nformerly fierce and warlike, but have been pacified and converted\r\nto Christianity. They had a separate language which has died out,\r\nand their customs are now those of the Christian natives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nItalones (13).\r\n\r\nThese people live in the south-west corner of Nueva Vizcaya, about\r\nthe head-waters of the River Magat. They are numerous, and occupy\r\nmany towns and villages, amongst them Bayombong, Dupax, Bambang,\r\nand Aritas. They were formerly warlike head-hunters, and are said to\r\nhave devoured the hearts and brains of their slain enemies in order\r\nto inherit their courage and wisdom. This is a Chinese idea, and is\r\neven now practised in Canton, where pieces of the heart and liver of\r\na particularly hardened and desperate criminal are retailed by the\r\nexecutioner at a high price for the above purpose. They wear their\r\nhair long like the Ilongotes. Their weapons were the lance, shield,\r\nor wood-knife, and in their customs and religion they resembled the\r\nIgorrotes. They were said to ornament the hilts of their swords with\r\nthe teeth of their slain enemies. All these detestable customs have\r\nnow disappeared; they have been converted to Christianity, and now are\r\npeaceful agriculturists and hunters. Game and fish abound; a telegraph\r\nline runs through their territory with a station at Bayombong. This\r\nis part of the line from Manila to Aparri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIbilaos (14).\r\n\r\nThese savages inhabit the hilly country about the sources of the River\r\nCasepuan, which, according to D'Almonte's map, is a tributary of the\r\nRiver Casiguran, which runs into the Bay of Baler; but, according\r\nto Olleros, is a tributary of the Rio Grande de Cagayan. However\r\nthis may be, their habitat is on the borders of Nueva Ecija and\r\nNueva Vizcaya. Some of these people have been subjugated, but the\r\nothers live a nomadic life in the mountain forests, and resemble the\r\nNegritos. Their pleasure is to lie in wait and shoot the passers-by\r\nwith their arrows. Like the Italones they are said to ornament\r\ntheir weapons with the teeth of the slain, and, like them, wear\r\ntheir hair long. The independent Ibilaos live by the chase, and on\r\njungle produce, and do no cultivation. They are small of stature and\r\nweak. It is possible that they are a hybrid Negrito Malay race. Their\r\nbloodthirsty propensities make them a curse to their neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIlongotes (15).\r\n\r\nThe Ilongotes inhabit the rocky fastnesses of the range of mountains\r\non the east coast, called the Caraballo de Baler, the whole length\r\nof the Distrito del Principe, the north-east corner of Nueva Vizcaya\r\nand a strip of the southern part of Isabela.\r\n\r\nTheir neighbours on the east are the Negritos, who live along the\r\nsea-shore. These people are also their neighbours on the north,\r\nwhere they inhabit the mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the west they have the Ifugaos in the northerly part of their\r\nboundary, and civilised Indians of mixed races in the southern\r\npart. Their nearest neighbours to the south are some scattered Tagals.\r\n\r\nBlumentritt describes them from a photograph lent him by\r\nDr. A. B. Meyer, as having eyes long and deeply sunk, upper lip and\r\nchin hairy, the hair long plaited in a tail, and often reaching the\r\nhips. A Spanish authority describes them as similar to the other\r\nhillmen, but wearing long hair, and dirty and disagreeable in their\r\naspect\r\n\r\nTheir dress is as primitive as that of the other savage races,\r\nthe adult men wearing a band of beaten bark round the waist, the\r\nwomen wearing a tapis, and the children going quite naked. They wear\r\nrings or spirals of brass wire on their arms, necklaces, and other\r\nornaments. But when the men have occasion to go into the Christian\r\nvillages, they wear shirts and trousers. I have myself seen instances\r\nof this custom amongst the Tagbanuas in Palawan.\r\n\r\nThey are clever smiths and know how to temper their weapons. Their\r\nlances have different shaped heads, and the shafts are made of Palma\r\nBrava. Their swords are well-made and ornamented, and are carried in\r\na wooden scabbard from a belt of webbing. This appears to be their\r\nfavourite weapon. They never go unarmed, even for a few paces, and\r\nthey sleep with their weapons beside them. Their shields are of light\r\nwood, carved, and painted red.\r\n\r\nTheir domestic life is not unlike that of the Christian natives,\r\nfor they are not polygamists; they, however, are more careless and\r\ndirty. They purchase their wife from her parents. They subsist by\r\nhunting and fishing, and by cultivating rice, maize, sweet potatoes,\r\nand other vegetables. They grow tobacco, which they exchange for\r\nother goods with the Christian natives. They catch the wild carabaos\r\nin traps. They are ineradicably addicted to head-hunting, and wage\r\na continual war with all their neighbours, but if an interval of\r\npeace occurs, they fight one family or clan against another, for they\r\nmust have heads. The marriage ceremony cannot be completed till the\r\nbridegroom has presented the bride with some of these grisly trophies;\r\nheads of Christians for choice.\r\n\r\nThey signify war by placing arrows in the path and sprinkling blood\r\nupon it. Treaties of peace, or rather truces, are sometimes ratified by\r\nhuman sacrifices, and the ceremony of blood-brothership is practised.\r\n\r\nThey have few religious practices, although they believe in a Supreme\r\nBeing, and in the ancestor-worship common to the country. The relatives\r\nassemble to celebrate a birth by a feast. On the fifth day a name\r\nis given to the infant. They take care of the sick and endeavour to\r\ncure them with herbs, to which they ascribe medicinal virtues. If the\r\npatient dies, the relatives devour everything in the house in order to\r\nmitigate their grief, and they bury the corpse within twenty-four hours\r\nof death, placing some provisions upon the grave. From a statement\r\nin a Spanish official publication, the Ilongote dialect is spoken\r\nin two towns and twenty-two rancherias of Nueva Vizcaya, and in four\r\nrancherias in the district of Principe. This shows that at least on\r\ntheir western border they are now somewhat held in check. But the\r\npoor Negritos still have to suffer their incursions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMayoyaos and Silipanes (16).\r\n\r\nThese people are very numerous, and inhabit the north-west corner\r\nof Nueva Vizcaya, and the south-west corner of Isabela, between the\r\nCordillera Central and the River Magat. For neighbours, they have on\r\nthe east the Ifugaos, those deadly lasso-throwers; on the west, the\r\nIgorrotes are separated from them by the Cordillera; to the north\r\nthey have the Gaddanes, and the Itetapanes, and to the south the\r\nItalones. In appearance, dress, arms and ornaments, they resemble the\r\nIgorrotes of Lepanto. The Ifugao language is spoken at the missions\r\nof Quiangan and Silipan, and in a large number of hamlets of these\r\npeople. They were pacified and converted to Christianity about half\r\na century ago, and are gradually improving in civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIfugaos (17).\r\n\r\nThe Ifugaos, who bear a strong resemblance to the Japanese, inhabit\r\na territory in central Nueva Vizcaya, and in the south of Isabela,\r\nmostly between the River Magat and the Rio Grande, but they have\r\na great many hamlets on the left bank of the Magat. They cultivate\r\nrice, camote, and other crops, but prefer to live by robbery whenever\r\npossible. They are persistent head-hunters, frequently at war with\r\nthe neighbouring tribes, or amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nOne notable peculiarity must be mentioned. Besides the lance, knife,\r\nand bow and arrows, they use the lasso, which they throw with great\r\ndexterity. Lurking near a trail, they cast the fatal coil over some\r\nunwary traveller, and promptly decapitate him, to add his skull to\r\ntheir collection, and decorate their hut.\r\n\r\nIt is their custom to wear as many rings in their ears as they have\r\ntaken heads.\r\n\r\nMajor Galvez, after a skirmish with these people, found the corpse\r\nof one of their warriors who wore thirty-two death-rings in his ears.\r\n\r\nTheir religion is said to be after the style of the Igorrotes, and\r\nsome other hill-tribes of Luzon. Their chief god Cabunian had two\r\nsons, Sumabit and Cabigat, and two daughters, Buingan and Daunguen,\r\nwho married amongst themselves, and from them the human race is\r\ndescended. Ancestor-worship is also practised. The Spaniards built\r\nand garrisoned a chain of forts in the Ifugao territory to keep them\r\nin order, and of late years their murderous incursions have been\r\nkept in check. It would require an enquiry on the spot to say whether\r\nthere is any prospect of this tribe becoming civilised, and converted\r\nto Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGaddanes (18).\r\n\r\nThe Gaddanes occupy the north-east quarter of Saltan and Bondoc,\r\nand their territory stretches over into Isabela in a south-easterly\r\ndirection to the River Magat, thus bordering on the five-mile strip\r\nof Ibanag territory on the left bank of the Rio Grande. The upper\r\npart of the Rio Chico runs through their Saltan territory, and the\r\nRiver Libug through their Isabela territory.\r\n\r\nIn appearance they are darker than any other of the hillmen of\r\nLuzon. They are not as well built as the Igorrotes. They have round\r\neyes, and large, flat noses. They are very dirty. Their houses are\r\nbuilt on lofty piles, and the ladder is drawn up at night, or in war\r\ntime. They are partly converted to Christianity, and are of a milder\r\ndisposition than their neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nItetapanes (19).\r\n\r\nThese people live in Bontoc, almost the centre of Northern Luzon. On\r\nthe west they have the Busaos Igorrotes, on the east the Gaddanes,\r\nto the north-west they have the Guinanes, and to the south the\r\nMayoyaos. They are more like the Gaddanes than any other neighbours,\r\nespecially in the eyes and hair, yet in other respects they are\r\nsomething like the Negritos in appearance, and much more so in their\r\ndispositions and customs, for it has not been possible to civilise\r\nthem. Their arms are the same as the Busaos, and, like them, they wear\r\na cylindrical shako, which they dye a brilliant red. They appear to\r\nbe a hopeless race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuinanes (20).\r\n\r\nThese terrible neighbours of the peaceful Tinguianes inhabit both\r\nslopes of the Cordillera Central in Abra and Bontoc. They do not pass\r\nto the west of the River Abra, or its affluent, the Pusulguan.\r\n\r\nOn the south the Guinanes have the warlike Busaos, who are well able to\r\ndefend themselves, and to retaliate on their aggressors. Consequently,\r\nthe Tinguianes are the principal victims; in fact, some years back,\r\nthey had no peace, and are not now free from danger.\r\n\r\nThe fame and respect enjoyed by a successful head-hunter is the great\r\nincentive to them to persevere in their sanguinary forays, which they\r\nconduct with the greatest cunning.\r\n\r\nThe return of the head-hunters to their village with their ghastly\r\ntrophies is celebrated by prolonged and frantic orgies--feasting\r\nand drinking, singing war-songs, music and dancing. In fact, their\r\nrejoicings only differ in degree and intensity from those customary\r\nin Christian nations to celebrate the slaughter of their enemies.\r\n\r\nSo fond are the Guinanes of getting heads, that when not at war with\r\nother tribes they fight amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nThey are much like the Igorrotes, and, like them, are settled in towns\r\nand villages. They practise agriculture, and are excellent smiths,\r\nand forge specially good knives, which are much esteemed by the Busaos,\r\nand find a ready sale amongst them.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of their manners and customs, or of their numbers,\r\nsince few travellers care to run the risk of having their skulls\r\nadded to the collection of some connoisseur.\r\n\r\nI cannot suggest any use this tribe could be to the United States,\r\nfor I do not think the most enthusiastic or devoted missionary would\r\nhanker after being appointed to convert them, and even if such an\r\none could be found, the probability of his success would be very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nCalauas, or Itaves (21).\r\n\r\nA small tribe, living in a strip of country stretching across the\r\ngreat loop formed by the Rio Chico de Cagayan just before it enters\r\nthe Rio Grande. They are peaceful and industrious cultivators,\r\nand grow rice and excellent tobacco. In former days, when the State\r\nmonopoly was in force, they used to smuggle this, and were attacked,\r\nand their plantations laid waste in consequence. But now they are\r\nable to trade freely, and must have become prosperous. Very little\r\nis known about them. The word Calauas is also spelt Calaguas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCamuangas and Bayabonanes (22).\r\n\r\nThese people live in the southern part of the province of Cagayan,\r\nsay about 17 deg. 30' north latitude. On the north they have the Calauas,\r\nor Calaguas, and on the south the Dadayags. D'Almonte's map shows no\r\nhamlets in their territory, and the nearest visita is Gamuasan. Nothing\r\nis known about them, and Blumentritt considers it not improbable that\r\nthey are a branch of the Dadayags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDadayags (23).\r\n\r\nA small tribe living in the north-west comer of Isabela, not far from\r\nthe left bank of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNabayuganes (24).\r\n\r\nThese people, who have a language of their own, live in two\r\nlong valleys extending from the Cordillera Central towards the\r\neast. According to D'Almonte's map, these parallel valleys lead down\r\nto the town of Malaneg, and in each of them there is a river. That\r\nin the northern valley is called the River Nabbuangan, and that in\r\nthe southern valley the River Nabbuanguan. They join before reaching\r\nMalaneg, forming the River Nagalat, a tributary of the Rio Chico\r\nde Cagayan. Nothing is known of their religion or nature. On the\r\nnorth-east of the Nabayuganes live the Aripas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAripas (25).\r\n\r\nThis tribe inhabits the hills to the west of the junction of the Rio\r\nGrande and Rio Chico of Cagayan. They have the Apayaos on the west,\r\nthe Ibanags on the east, the Calingas on the north, and the Ilanes\r\non the south. They are peaceful, and partly converted to Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalingas (26).\r\n\r\nThese people inhabit the mountains to the north of the Aripas. On\r\ntheir north and east they have the Ibanags, and on the west the\r\nApayaos. They are supposed to have a good deal of Chinese blood in\r\ntheir veins. They are now peaceful, like the Aripas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTinguianes (27).\r\n\r\nThe Tinguianes inhabit the western half of the province of Abra, and\r\ntheir villages are thickly scattered about on the eastern slopes of\r\nthe Ilocos mountains, and on the banks of the River Abra. They have\r\nalso pushed their way to the extreme north-east corner of Abra, and\r\nthey extend southwards and westwards along the coast as far as Punta\r\nDarigayos. Santiago is a Christian Tinguian town, and was founded\r\nin 1736.\r\n\r\nThe Tinguianes are of a peaceful disposition, and are gradually\r\nbecoming civilised and converted to Christianity. In fact, of late\r\nyears, the advance of the Spaniards has been considerable. It is only\r\nin the more remote parts of their territory that some of them retain\r\ntheir independence, and their ancient laws, beliefs and customs. The\r\nconstant intercourse they have with the Ilocanos has resulted in\r\nspreading that dialect amongst them, whilst their own language is\r\ndying out.\r\n\r\nIn appearance the Tinguianes differ considerably from the other\r\nmountain tribes of Luzon, being taller, and of a much lighter\r\ncolour. Their noses are not flattened like those of the Malays, but\r\nare aquiline, and remind one of the features of the Cholos of the\r\nPeruvian coast. They are a cleanly people; the men wear turbans,\r\njacket and trousers; the women belonging to their nobility have\r\ntheir garments beautifully embroidered. They wear arm-sheaths, and\r\nsometimes leg-sheaths, made of plaited fibre, and ornamented with\r\nbeads, or with coloured stones, brought from the Batanes islands,\r\nwhich they purchase in Ilocos. They also wear necklaces of these\r\nstones, copper or silver ear-rings, and other trinkets.\r\n\r\nSpanish writers consider these people to have a strong admixture of\r\nChinese blood, and suppose it may be from a remnant of the pirates\r\nunder Li-ma-hon, who were defeated by Juan Salcedo in 1574. The learned\r\nBlumentritt, however, dissents from this opinion, which he considers to\r\nbe a modern invention, and gives Salcedo credit for doing his work very\r\nthoroughly, and not letting many of the pirates escape. He says that,\r\nalthough in dress and appearance the Tinguianes are very similar to\r\nthe fishermen of the province of Fo-Kien, there are no Chinese words\r\nto be found in their dialect, and that consequently the intermixture\r\nof Chinese can only have been small. However this may be, the coast of\r\nFo-Kien, which is opposite Formosa, is only about 500 miles from the\r\nPort of Vigan, the currents are favourable for the southerly voyage,\r\nand sailing craft can cross in either monsoon. Consequently, either\r\nas traders, fugitives, or castaways, Fo-Kien sailors or fishermen\r\ncould easily have arrived on the coast.\r\n\r\nThe Tinguianes assiduously cultivate their land, and irrigate their\r\nrice-fields with some skill. They breed horses and cattle, which\r\nthey sell in the markets of Ilocos, as well as jungle produce, wax,\r\nskins and gold-dust. They raft timber down the Abra River and make\r\nfor sale various articles of wood, such as bateas, ladles and spoons,\r\nalso they make mats and baskets.\r\n\r\nTheir marriages are conducted in a similar manner to those of other\r\ntribes, the ceremony, whether Christian or heathen, being followed by\r\nthe usual feasts and dancing, and music in the intervals of eating and\r\ndrinking. Their instruments are drums, flutes and guitars. As usual,\r\nroast pig is the principal dish, the animal being roasted whole on\r\na spit of cane. When the feast is over the newly-married couple are\r\nconducted to their house by the principal chief or elder. A large mat\r\nbeing spread on the ground they lie down on it keeping at a distance\r\nof several feet from each other. A boy of six or eight years of age\r\nthen lies down between them, and the elders retire leaving the trio\r\ntogether. The bride and bridegroom are forbidden to indulge in any\r\ncaresses, nor even to speak to each other till the following day. The\r\nhealthy life led by the women enables them to recover very rapidly\r\nafter child-birth. In fact, they return to their usual avocations\r\ndirectly after the ceremony of purification, which consists of washing\r\nthe newly-born infant in running water. Divorce among the heathen is\r\nmerely a matter of paying a fine of some thirty dollars, in money or\r\nin kind, to the village chief or elder, or to the Goberna-doreillo,\r\nif the village is under Spanish rule. Divorce is not allowed amongst\r\nthose who are converted, and this must be a great hindrance to their\r\nacceptance of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThey take little care of the sick, and when hope is given up the\r\npatient is left alone to die. The Peruvian Indians have a similar\r\ncustom. Amongst the Serranos, when a sick person does not soon show\r\nsigns of recovery, a family meeting is called, and a fixed sum is\r\nvoted for his cure, say twelve or twenty reals. When this amount has\r\nbeen spent, the patient is removed from his couch and laid upon a\r\nhide on the ground outside the house. A child is posted to fan him\r\nand keep off the flies, and only water is given him till he dies.\r\n\r\nThe Tinguianes formerly buried their dead in pits dug under their\r\nhouses, after subjecting the corpses to a baking or drying process,\r\nand on certain days in the year food was placed near the tombs for the\r\nsouls of the dead to partake of. Those who are converted have of course\r\nto bury their dead in the cemetery, and to pay a fee to the priest.\r\n\r\nThey share the idea that seems to prevail amongst all Malays, that the\r\nsoul is absent from the body during sleep, and that consequently it\r\nis dangerous and wicked to awake anybody suddenly. The most dreadful\r\nthing that can happen to anybody, therefore, is to die whilst sleeping,\r\nleaving his soul wandering about. Their most desperate curse is to\r\nwish that this may happen to an adversary. This seems to reach a higher\r\nlevel of cursing than the oaths of the Tagals which I have previously\r\nmentioned. The usual respect for ancestors is shown, and any weapons\r\nor ornaments which have belonged to them are carefully preserved as\r\nvalued heirlooms. The names of an ancestor must, however, on no account\r\nbe pronounced by his descendants, so that if any necessity arises to\r\nanswer a question which involves mentioning the name of one, a friend\r\nnot related to the person enquired about must be called in to answer.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de la Gironiere visited these people, and describes them\r\nas men of good stature, slightly bronzed, with straight hair,\r\nregular profiles, and aquiline noses. The women truly beautiful and\r\ngraceful. They appeared to him to resemble the people of the South\r\nof France, except for their costume and language. The men wore a\r\nbelt and a sort of turban made from the bark of the fig-tree. Their\r\narms consisted of a long lance, a small axe, called aligua, and a\r\nshield. The women wore a belt and a narrow apron which came down to\r\ntheir knees, their heads being ornamented with pearls, and grains of\r\ncoral and gold were fixed amongst their hair. The upper parts of their\r\nhands were painted blue, and they wore plaited sheaths ornamented\r\nwith beads on their fore-arms; these sheaths strongly compressed the\r\nfore-arm, being put on when the women were young, and they prevented\r\nthe development of the fore-arm, whilst causing the wrists and hands\r\nto swell. This is a beauty amongst the Tinguianes as the little foot\r\nis amongst the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThey occupied seventeen villages, and each family had two habitations,\r\none on the ground for use in the day, and one fixed on piles or on\r\nthe summits of lofty trees, as much as sixty or eighty feet from the\r\nground, where they sleep, to protect themselves from the nocturnal\r\nattacks of the Guinanes, their mortal and sanguinary enemies. From\r\nthese lofty dwellings they threw down stones upon assailants. In\r\nthe middle of each village there is a large shed which serves for\r\nmeetings and public ceremonies. He further states that after an attack\r\nof the Guinanes had been repulsed from Laganguilan-y-Madalay by the\r\nTinguianes he went to an assembly at that village and witnessed a\r\nceremony in honour of the victory. The heads of the slain enemies were\r\nexhibited to the crowd, and various speeches were made. The skulls\r\nwere then split open and the brains removed and given to some young\r\ngirls, who worked them up with their hands in a quantity of basi or\r\nnative beer. The compound was then served in cups to the chiefs, who\r\npartook of it with every appearance of enjoyment, and was afterwards\r\nhanded round to all the warriors in due order. M. de la Gironiere and\r\nhis Tagal servant also partook of this refreshment out of politeness\r\nto their hosts. The ceremony was followed by a dance and a smoking\r\nconcert, during which copious libations of basi were consumed.\r\n\r\nM. de la Gironiere has omitted to mention how his hosts, after this\r\ndrunken orgy, managed to regain their elevated sleeping quarters,\r\nsixty or eighty feet from the ground. One would think that the Tinguian\r\ncoroner would have been busy the next morning. He, however, does tell\r\nus that, being unable to sleep, he got up in the night and looked\r\nabout him, finding a well or pit, which he descended. At different\r\nlevels in this shaft were short galleries or niches, and in each of\r\nthese was a dried or mummified corpse. This shaft was sunk inside\r\nthe house where he slept.\r\n\r\nHe learnt from the Tinguianes that they believed in the existence\r\nof the soul, that it leaves the body after death, but remains in\r\nthe family. Also that they venerated any strange object, such as a\r\nrock or tree which resembled some animal. They would make a hut over\r\nor near it, and celebrate a feast, at which they sacrificed pigs;\r\nthey afterwards danced and drunk basi, then burnt down the hut and\r\nretired. They had, he says, only one wife, but might have several\r\nconcubines, who, however, did not inhabit the conjugal domicile, but\r\neach had a hut of her own. The riches of a Tinguian was demonstrated\r\nby the number of porcelain vases he possessed. According to M. de la\r\nGironiere, the Tinguianes mummified their dead by subjecting them to a\r\nlong drying process. The body, propped up on a stool, was surrounded\r\nby braziers with charcoal or wood embers, and the moisture which\r\nexuded from it was wiped off by the women with cotton. When the body\r\nwas well dried up it was kept above ground for fifteen days and then\r\ncommitted to the tomb. The neighbours and friends kept up the wake\r\nand pronounced eulogies on the defunct until they had consumed all\r\nthe eatables and liquor in the house, when they took their departure.\r\n\r\nThese people must have very greatly increased in numbers, as the\r\nSpanish authority has extended its protection to them, checking the\r\nincursions of the Guinanes and other savages. It has been stated that\r\nin former years the Tinguianes were much sought after as recruits for\r\nthe garrison of Manila. They do not appear to be a warlike race, yet so\r\nfine a body of men ought to be able to supply a battalion of infantry\r\nfor the native army which the United States will have to raise, for\r\nnobody can suppose that 25,000 young Americans can be permanently kept\r\nin garrison in the Archipelago. But this I discuss in another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdangs (28).\r\n\r\nAccording to D'Almonte's map in the latitude of Pasuquin, Province\r\nof Ilocos Notre, the Cordillera del Norte bends to the eastward and\r\nthrows out a spur to the north-west, forming a Y, and enclosing a\r\nconsiderable valley, through which runs a river called the Bate,\r\nBucarog, or Arimit, which falls into the Bay of Bangui. This is the\r\nhabitat of the Adangs, a small tribe, yet a nation, for their language\r\nhas no resemblance to that of any of their neighbours. Their customs\r\nare nearer those of the Apayaos than any other. They are civilised and\r\nhave been Christians for generations. Their chief town is Adan or Adam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApayaos (29).\r\n\r\nThis race was formerly very warlike, but is now more civilized, and\r\nmany even converted to Christianity. They inhabit the mountainous\r\nregion round about the River Apayao, on the east of the Cordillera\r\ndel Norte and extend down towards the plains of the Rio Chico.\r\n\r\nThey pay some attention to agriculture, and besides growing vegetables\r\nand maize for their own use, they raise tobacco and cacao which\r\nthey trade away to the Ilocanos in exchange for such articles as\r\nthey require.\r\n\r\nTheir houses compare favourably with those of the other\r\nhill-tribes. They are raised to a considerable height, being square\r\nin form with heavy hardwood posts at the corners. The floor is made of\r\ncedar planks, the roof is thatched with cogon or reeds, and the walls\r\nand partitions are of plaited palm leaves. A fire-place is arranged in\r\none corner. They ornament the walls with remarkable taste, hanging up\r\nthe ornaments and arms of their ancestors, which they greatly prize\r\nand will not part with for any price.\r\n\r\nThey also highly value Chinese and Japanese pottery or porcelain.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that the worship of ancestors is with them piously\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThey used to be head-hunters and made the death of any of their\r\nchief men an excuse to lie in ambush and massacre any inoffensive\r\npassers-by for the purpose of taking the heads to place round the\r\ncorpse and afterwards bury them with it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the steady pressure of the Spanish authority, during long\r\nterms of years, has nearly eradicated this detestable custom, and\r\nif practised at all, it is only in the remoter fastnesses of the\r\nmountains, where they cannot yet be controlled.\r\n\r\nThe Apayaos living in the plains are mostly reduced to obedience,\r\nand many pay the poll-tax.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there is a prospect of these people being civilised\r\nand becoming useful cultivators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalanganes and Irayas (30-31).\r\n\r\nThe Irayas live in scattered hamlets on the summits of the Sierra\r\nMadre, and on its western slopes right down to the Rio Grande. Their\r\nterritory extends for about twenty geographical miles on each side of\r\nthe 17th parallel. Amongst them live many Negritos who have renounced\r\ntheir nomadic life, and have adopted the manners and customs of their\r\nhosts. The tattooing of the Irayas and Negritos is similar. The Irayas\r\nare a Malay tribe amongst whom are found individuals of a Mongolian\r\ntype, others are hybrid Negrito Malays.\r\n\r\nThey do a little slovenly agriculture, using buffaloes for\r\nploughing. They catch an abundance of fish from the four considerable\r\nstreams running through their territory. They consume a large quantity\r\nof fish with their rice, and salt and sell the surplus to their\r\nneighbours. They are characteristically light-hearted and hospitable,\r\nand readily receive remontados and other strangers. Their religion is\r\nthe usual Anito worship. They build wretched houses, and are very dirty\r\nin their habits, throwing their refuse down in front of the house.\r\n\r\nThe Catalanganes take their name from the River Catalangan which runs\r\ninto the Rio Grande near Ilagan. They are a branch of the Irayas,\r\nbut show a more strongly marked Mongolian type.\r\n\r\nThey are cleaner than the Irayas, and more industrious, and provident,\r\nstoring up provisions against a bad harvest.\r\n\r\nTheir fields are much better kept than those of the Irayas, and they\r\nemploy their spare time in felling trees and hewing them into canoes,\r\nwhich find a ready sale at Ilagan.\r\n\r\nThey dress much like the Christian Malays, but are tattooed in patterns\r\nof Chinese or Japanese origin.\r\n\r\nTheir laws prescribe severe penalties for theft and other\r\ncrimes. Their weapons are bows and arrows, and they are said to be\r\nvery cowardly. Their choice of weapons confirms this statement.\r\n\r\nThey differ much from the Irayas in character, for they are\r\ninhospitable, avaricious and greedy, and of a gloomy disposition. On\r\nthe other hand, they keep their houses cleaner.\r\n\r\nThey have temples for worship, and some roughly-made\r\nmonuments. According to Semper, they have two pairs of gods which they\r\nspecially worship in June: Tschichenan, with his wife Bebenaugan,\r\nand Sialo with his wife Binalinga. The usual ancestor-worship also\r\nprevails, and they show great respect for the Anitos according to\r\nseniority, providing special shelters and little benches near their\r\nhouses for their convenience.\r\n\r\nBoth Irayas and Catalanganes have Gobernadorcillos appointed by the\r\nSpanish Military Governor of Isabela. They pay the poll-tax, called\r\nby the Spaniards \"Acknowledgment of Vassalage,\" but are otherwise\r\nindependent and administer their own laws and customs. They are quite\r\npeaceful, and will doubtless in time advance in civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nCatubanganes (32).\r\n\r\nA tribe of savages inhabiting the mountains of Guinayangan in\r\nTayabas, from whence they raid the Christian villages and drive off\r\ncattle. Nothing is known about their origin or habits; they have some\r\nwandering Negritos as neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVicols (33).\r\n\r\nThe Vicols inhabit the southern half of the province of Camarines\r\nNorte, the whole of Camarines Sur and Albay, the islands of\r\nCatanduanes, Burias, and Ticao, and the northern shores of\r\nMasbate. They are civilised, and have been Christians for centuries.\r\n\r\nThey speak a dialect of their own, which, according to Jagor,\r\nis midway between Tagal and Visay, which dialect is spoken in its\r\ngreatest purity by the inhabitants of the Isarog volcano and its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, and that thence towards the west the dialect\r\nbecomes more and more like the Tagal, and towards the east like the\r\nVisay until by degrees, before reaching the ethnographical boundary,\r\nit merges into those kindred languages.\r\n\r\nIn manners and customs they appear to be half-bred between these two\r\nraces, yet, according to F. Blumentritt, they preceded the Tagals,\r\nand were in fact the first Malays to arrive in Luzon. They show signs\r\nof intermixture with Polynesian or Papuan stock.\r\n\r\nThey are physically inferior to the Tagals, nor do they possess the\r\nproud warlike spirit of the dwellers in north Luzon. They are less\r\ncleanly, and live in poorer houses.\r\n\r\nThe men dress like the Tagals, but the women wear the patadion instead\r\nof a saya, and a shirt of guinara.\r\n\r\nBlumentritt says the men carry the Malay kris instead of the bolo, but\r\nI did not see a kris carried by any one when I visited the province.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the regulations enforced at that time by the Guardia Civil\r\nwere against carrying such a weapon. The bolo, on the other hand,\r\nis a necessary tool.\r\n\r\nI visited the province of Camarines Sur, going from Manila to Pasacao\r\nby sea, and from there travelled by road to an affluent of the River\r\nVicol, and then by canoe on a moonlit night to Nueva Caceres, the\r\ncapital of the province.\r\n\r\nHere I met a remarkable man, the late Bishop Gainza, and was much\r\nimpressed by his keen intellect and great knowledge of the country.\r\n\r\nHe was said to be a man of great ambition, and I can quite believe\r\nit. Originally a Dominican monk, it was intended that he should have\r\nbeen made Archbishop of Manila, but, somehow, Father Pedro Paya, at\r\nthat time Procurator of the Order in Madrid, got himself nominated\r\ninstead, and Gainza had to content himself with the bishopric of\r\nNueva Caceres.\r\n\r\nHe was a model of self-denial, living most frugally on a small part of\r\nhis revenue, contributing a thousand dollars a year to the funds of\r\nthe Holy Father, and spending the remainder in building or repairing\r\nchurches and schools in his diocese, or in assisting undertakings he\r\nthought likely to benefit the province.\r\n\r\nAmongst other works, I remember that he had tried to cut a canal from\r\nthe River Vicol to the Bay of Ragay. He had excavated a portion of\r\nit, but either on his death, or from the difficulties raised by the\r\nPublic Works Department, the work was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscan friars, who held the benefices in that province,\r\nopposed him, and annoyed him in every possible way.\r\n\r\nThe present bishop, Father Arsenio Ocampo, formerly an Augustinian\r\nmonk, is a clever and enlightened man, with whom I had dealings when\r\nhe was Procurator-General of his Order.\r\n\r\nI have made this digression from my subject, because so much has\r\nbeen said against the clergy of the Philippines, that I feel impelled\r\nto bring before my readers this instance of a bishop who constantly\r\nendeavoured to promote the interests of his province.\r\n\r\nNueva Caceres possessed several schools, a hospital, a lepers'\r\nhospital, and a training-college for school-mistresses had just been\r\nestablished by Bishop Gainza's initiative.\r\n\r\nThe shops were mostly in the hands of Chinese, who did a flourishing\r\ntrade in Manchester goods, patadoins, and coloured handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nThere were several Spanish and Mestizo merchants who dealt in hemp\r\nand rice.\r\n\r\nFrom Nueva Caceres I travelled by a good road to Iriga, a town near\r\nthe volcano of that name, passing close to the Isarog on my way. From\r\nIriga I visited the country round about, and Lake Bula.\r\n\r\nSome years after I went from Manila by sea to Tabaco, on the Pacific\r\ncoast of Albay, getting a fine night view of the Mayon volcano (8272\r\nfeet) in violent eruption.\r\n\r\nFrom Tabaco I drove to Tivi and visited the celebrated boiling-well\r\nand hot-springs at that place, much frequented by the natives, and\r\nsometimes by Europeans, for the cure of rheumatism and other diseases.\r\n\r\nNow that the Stars and Stripes float over the Philippines it is to\r\nbe hoped that a regular sanatorium will be erected at this beautiful\r\nand health-restoring spot, the advantages of which might attract\r\nsufferers from all the Far East.\r\n\r\nOn these journeys I had a good opportunity of studying the people. The\r\nchief exports are Abaca (Manila hemp), and rice. In Camarines Sur\r\nthe principal crop is rice, whilst in Albay the hemp predominates,\r\nand they import rice.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of rice, which I have briefly described when writing\r\nof the Tagals, is not an occupation calculated to improve the minds\r\nor bodies of those engaged in it, and I have noticed that wherever\r\nthis is the staple crop the peasantry are in a distinctly lower\r\ncondition than where cane is planted and sugar manufactured. Their\r\nlives are passed in alternate periods of exhausting labour and of utter\r\nidleness, there is nothing to strive for, nothing to learn, nothing\r\nto improve. The same customs go on from generation to generation,\r\nthe same rude implements are used, and the husbandman paid for his\r\nlabour in kind lives destitute of comfort in the present, and without\r\nhope for the future.\r\n\r\nNor can the cultivation and preparation of hemp be considered as a\r\nmuch more improving occupation.\r\n\r\nLittle care, indeed, is required by the Musa textilis after the\r\nfirst planting, and the cleaning of the fibre is a simple matter,\r\nbut very laborious.\r\n\r\nSeveral Spaniards are settled in these provinces, also a few agents\r\nof British houses in Manila, and some Chinese and Mestizos. They\r\nusually complain bitterly of the difficulty they experience in getting\r\nhemp delivered to them owing to the laziness and unpunctuality of\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding this, most of them live in affluence and some\r\nhave amassed fortunes by Vicol labour. There is, in fact, a good deal\r\nof money in Albay, Daraga, and other towns in the hemp districts, and\r\nthey are the happy hunting-ground of the Jew pedlar who there finds\r\na good market for yellow diamonds and off-colour gems unsaleable in\r\nLondon or Paris. Houndsditch and Broadway will do well to note.\r\n\r\nThe peasantry, however, either from improvidence or aversion to steady\r\nlabour, seem to be rather worse off than the Tagals and Pampangos,\r\nmore especially those amongst them who cultivate paddy.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the large amount of hemp exported from Manila and Cebu\r\nis cleaned by hand.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to employ machinery, but the inherent\r\nconditions of the industry are unfavourable to success in this line.\r\n\r\nThe plants are grown principally on the eastern slopes of the volcanic\r\nmountains of Southern Luzon, and the adjacent islands where the soil\r\nis soft and friable and roads are unknown.\r\n\r\nThe heavy stems of the plants cannot profitably be conveyed to fixed\r\nworks for treatment, and no machine has yet been devised light enough\r\nto be carried up to the lates or plantations and able to compete with\r\nhand labour. In a recent report to the British North Borneo Company,\r\nMr. W. C. Cowie mentions his hopes that Thompson's Fibre Company\r\nare about to send out a trial decorticator, with engine and boiler\r\nto drive it, to the River Padas, in that company's territories, for\r\ncleaning the fibre of the numerous plants of the Musa textilis growing\r\nin that region. It will be interesting to learn the result. Possibly\r\nthe conditions of transport by rail or river are more favourable than\r\nin the Philippines, and in that case a measure of success is quite\r\npossible. But few errors are more expensive than to unwarrantably\r\nassume that machinery must necessarily be cheaper than hand labour.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, as regards the Philippines here is a nice little problem. If\r\nthe mechanics of Massachusetts and Connecticut cannot solve it,\r\nI do not know who can.\r\n\r\nThe Vicol labourers proceed to the lates in couples, carrying their\r\nsimple and efficient apparatus, all of which, except the knife,\r\nthey make themselves.\r\n\r\nOne man cuts down the plant, removes the outer covering, and separates\r\nthe layers forming the stem, dividing them into strips about one and\r\na half inches wide, and spreading them out to air.\r\n\r\nThe other man standing at his bench, takes a strip and places the\r\nmiddle of it across the convex block and under the knife, which is\r\nheld up by the spring of a sapling overhead. Then, placing one foot\r\non a treadle hanging from the handle of the knife, he firmly presses\r\nthe latter down on the block. It should be explained that the knife\r\nis not sharp enough to cut the fibres. Firmly grasping the strip\r\nin both hands, and throwing his body backwards, he steadily draws\r\nthe strip towards him till all the fibre has passed the knife; then,\r\nremoving his foot from the treadle, the knife is lifted from the block\r\nby the spring, leaving the pulp and waste behind it. Sweeping this\r\noff, he reverses the half-cleaned strip, and twisting the cleaned\r\nfibre round one hand and wrist, and grasping it also with the other,\r\nhe draws the part he formerly held, under the knife, pressing the\r\ntreadle with the foot as before, and thus completes the cleaning of\r\none strip. The fibre is often six feet long, and only requires drying\r\nin the sun to be marketable.\r\n\r\nA man is able to clean about twenty-five pounds of hemp per day,\r\nand receives one half of it for his labour.\r\n\r\nHe usually sells his share to his employer for a trifle under the\r\nmarket price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in Luzon.\r\n\r\n    Mestizos or half-breeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Legaspi founded the city of Manila, in 1571, he found that Chinese\r\njunks frequented the port, and carried on a trade with Tondo and the\r\nother native towns.\r\n\r\nThree years later, the Chinese pirate, Li-ma-hon, made an attack on\r\nthe new city with a force of 2000 men in ninety-five small vessels,\r\nbut was repulsed.\r\n\r\nIn 1603, the Chinese in Manila, under Eng-cang, rose against the\r\nSpaniards, and entrenched themselves in the suburbs. The Spaniards\r\nfailed in the first assault with heavy loss, but ultimately the Chinese\r\nwere defeated, and 23,000 were massacred, the few remaining being made\r\ngalley-slaves. In 1639, another insurrection of the Chinese occurred\r\nand again some 23,000 were massacred.\r\n\r\nIn 1662, in consequence of the Chinese pirate Cong-seng demanding\r\ntribute from the governor of the Philippines, a decree was made that\r\nall Chinese must leave. The Chinese, however, refused, and entrenched\r\nthemselves in the Parian, or market-place, outside the walls. They were\r\nattacked, and many thousands were killed. A body of 2000 endeavoured\r\nto march north, but were massacred by the Pampangos.\r\n\r\nIn 1762, when Manila was taken by the forces of the Honourable East\r\nIndia Company, the Chinese eagerly joined in the plundering. It having\r\nbeen rumoured that the Chinese intended to join the British forces,\r\nDon Simon de Anda condemned them all to death, and most of them were\r\nhung, their property passing to their executioners.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, there occurred the fifth and last massacre of the\r\nChinese. The mob of Manila took advantage of the abject cowardice of\r\nthe acting-governor, General Folgueras, and of other authorities,\r\nand for hours vented their spite on the unhappy Chinamen, showing\r\nthem no mercy, and carrying off their goods.\r\n\r\nSince that time no general massacre has taken place, but such is the\r\ndislike of the natives to the Chinese, that these latter would have\r\nbeen quickly exterminated if the Spanish Government had failed at\r\nany time to protect them.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are mostly herded together in Manila, and in some of\r\nthe larger towns. Some few venture to keep stores in the villages,\r\nand others travel about at the risk of their lives in the sugar,\r\nhemp and tobacco districts, as purchasers and collectors of produce.\r\n\r\nI consider that they should not be allowed to do this, for the\r\ninvariable result of their interference is to reduce the quality of\r\neverything they handle. Their trade is based upon false weights and\r\nmeasures, and upon adulteration, or insufficient preparation of the\r\nproduce. They are very patient with the natives, and this gives them\r\na very great advantage over a European, even if the latter is used\r\nto Eastern ways. An American would probably have less patience than\r\nany European in negotiating a purchase of produce from an up-country\r\nnative; the waste of time would exasperate him. I feel sure that most\r\nof those who know the Philippines will agree with me as to the evil\r\nresults of the operations of the Chinese produce-brokers. Adulterated\r\nsugar, half-rotten hemp, half-cured tobacco, badly-prepared\r\nindigo--that is what the Chinaman brings in. He spoils every article\r\nhe trades in, and discredits it in the world's markets.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese nowhere cultivate the soil, except the gardens and\r\nmarket-gardens around Manila, and a few of the large towns.\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, not due to their unwillingness to do so, but because\r\nthey dare not; the natives are too jealous of them, and their lives\r\nwould not be safe away from the towns.\r\n\r\nTheir genius is commercial, and they are at home in shop, bazaar, or\r\noffice. I think that the Chinese agriculturist does not leave his home\r\nfor the Philippines. Most of those in the islands come from Amoy, and\r\nthe district round that port. Some few are from Macao; they seem to be\r\nall townsmen, not countrymen. Each shopkeeper has several assistants,\r\nranging in age from boys of ten or twelve upwards. On arrival, they are\r\nplaced in a sort of school--a very practical one--to learn Spanish;\r\nfor instance, numbers and coins, with such terms as Muy barato--very\r\ncheap. As a Chinaman cannot pronounce the letter R, but substitutes L,\r\nthis becomes Muy balato. Thus, also, the Roo-Kiu Islands become the\r\nLoo-Chew Islands, in Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe Chinaman is an excellent shop-keeper or pedlar, and some years\r\nago, the British importers of Manchester goods made it a practice\r\nto give credit for goods supplied to the Chinese; the banks also\r\nextended some facilities to them. In consequence, however, of heavy\r\nlosses to several British firms, this custom has been abandoned,\r\nor considerably restricted.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are good barbers, cooks and gardeners. As breeders of\r\nfish they are unrivalled. Besides this they compete successfully\r\nwith the Tagal in the following trades: blacksmiths, boiler-makers,\r\nstokers, engine-drivers, ship and house carpenters, boat-builders,\r\ncabinet-makers and varnishers, iron and brass-founders, shoe-makers,\r\ntin-smiths. These artisans are very industrious, and labour constantly\r\nat their trades. Their great feast is at the Chinese New Year, which\r\noccurs in February, when they take about a week's holiday, and regale\r\nthemselves on roast pig, and other delicacies, making also presents\r\nof sweets, fruits, and Jocchiu hams, to their patrons and customers.\r\n\r\nThere are Chinese apothecaries in Manila, but they are mostly resorted\r\nto by their own countrymen, and their awful concoctions are nasty\r\nbeyond belief. They deal largely in aphrodisiacs.\r\n\r\nSome Chinese doctors practise in Manila, and are said to make wonderful\r\ncures, even on patients given up by the orthodox medicos. They feel\r\nthe pulse at the temporal artery, or else above the bridge of the nose.\r\n\r\nThey used to suffer a good deal from the jealousy of the Spanish\r\npractitioners, and were persecuted for practising without a\r\nqualification.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of Chinese coolies are employed in Manila handling coal,\r\nloading and unloading ships and lighters, pressing hemp, drying sugar,\r\nand in other work too hard and too constant for the natives.\r\n\r\nThe number of Chinese in Luzon has been variously estimated at from\r\n30,000 to 60,000 men, and two or three hundred women. The anonymous\r\nauthor of 'Filipinas--Problema Fundamental' (Madrid, 1891), gives\r\nthe number of Chinese in the whole Archipelago as 125,000, and he\r\nevidently had access to good information. The fact is nobody knows,\r\nand in all probability the Spanish authorities had an interest in\r\nunderstating the number.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese were organised quite separately from the natives. Wherever\r\ntheir numbers were considerable, they had their own tribunal, with\r\na Gobernadorcillo and Principales, the former called the Capitan-China.\r\n\r\nIn Manila, this Capitan was a man of importance, or else the nominee of\r\nsuch a person. Certain governors-general received, nay, even extorted,\r\nlarge sums from the Capitan-China. Weyler is said to have been one of\r\nthese offenders, but Jovellar caused the Capitan-China to be turned out\r\nof Malacanan for offering him a present. No one who knew them would\r\never believe that Moriones or Despujols would condescend to accept\r\npresents from the Chinamen. One favourite trick of the more corrupt\r\ngovernors-general was to have some very obnoxious law made in Spain;\r\nfor instance, obliging the Chinese to become cabezas-de-barangay, or\r\nresponsible tax-collectors of their own countrymen, and then extort\r\na ransom for not putting the law in force. Weyler was said to have\r\nreceived $80,000 from the Chinese on this account, but some of this\r\nwould have to go to Madrid.\r\n\r\nAt another time it was proposed that the Chinese should be obliged to\r\nkeep their accounts in Spanish on books having every leaf stamped, and\r\nthat every firm should employ a trained accountant who had passed an\r\nexamination in book-keeping, and obtained a diploma as a commercial\r\nexpert. What it cost the Celestials to avoid this infliction I do\r\nnot know.\r\n\r\nAmidst all this extortion from the Spaniard, and notwithstanding the\r\never-present hatred of the native, the Manila Chinaman is a sleek\r\nand prosperous-looking person, and seems cheerful and contented. If\r\nhe becomes wealthy he may very likely become a Christian, less,\r\nperhaps, from any conviction or faith, but from motives of interest,\r\nand to facilitate his marriage to a native woman, or half-caste. He\r\ninvariably selects an influential god-father, and dutifully takes him\r\ncomplimentary presents on his feast-day, wife's feast-day, etc. Baptism\r\nused to cost him a substantial fee, but it brought him business, for\r\nthe priests were good customers to him. Now, however, with freedom\r\nof religion, with civil marriage and the withdrawal of the friars,\r\nhe may be able to marry without the trouble of changing his religion.\r\n\r\nWhether Christian or heathen, he usually keeps a few sticks of incense\r\nburning before an image at the back of his shop, and contributes to\r\nany subscription the priest may be raising.\r\n\r\nI look upon the Chinaman as a necessity in the Philippines, but\r\nconsider that he must be governed by exceptional legislation, and not\r\nbe allowed to enter indiscriminately, nor to engage, as a matter of\r\ncourse, in every calling.\r\n\r\nIf attempts are to be made to settle them on the land, great care must\r\nbe shown in selecting the localities, and great precautions taken\r\nto prevent fighting between the Chinese and the natives. However,\r\nthere should be plenty of room for tens of thousands of agricultural\r\nlabourers in Palawan and Mindanao; but I consider women to be\r\nessential to the success of such colonies. The family is the base of\r\nany permanent settlement, and it ought to be made a condition that\r\na considerable number of women should come over with the men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMestizos, or Half-Breeds.\r\n\r\nFrom the intercourse of Spanish and other Europeans with\r\nthe native women, there has sprung a race called Mestizo, or\r\nMestizo-Espanol. Similarly, the Chinese, by their alliance with native\r\nwomen, have produced the Mestizo-Chino, or Sangley.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to say how many there are of these people, for\r\nopinions differ widely. The anonymous author of a pamphlet called\r\n'Filipinas' (Madrid, 1891), gives the number of Spanish Mestizos in\r\nthe Archipelago, in 1890, as 75,000, whilst he estimates the number\r\nof Chinese Mestizos at no less than half a million. The Spanish\r\nMestizos vary much in appearance, character and education, according\r\nto whether they have come under the influence of their father or\r\ntheir mother. Many of them are people of considerable property, and\r\nhave been educated in Spain, Germany or England, or at the university\r\nin Manila. Others have relapsed into the ordinary native life. As a\r\nclass they are possessed of much influence. Both in Manila and in the\r\ncountry towns they own large houses, and much landed property. Their\r\nsuperior intelligence and education enables them to prosper in business\r\nor in professions. Some of them are doctors of medicine, or lawyers. A\r\nvery few have studied engineering. Again, a fair number are priests,\r\nand of these, some are men of great learning.\r\n\r\nThe Mestizos are the capitalists, which is to say the usurers of the\r\ncountry. They have not personally participated much in the revolts\r\nagainst the Spaniards, nor yet in the fighting against the Americans,\r\nthough they may have given small sums to assist the movement. They will\r\nbe there, though, when offices are to be distributed, and will make\r\nhard masters, more oppressive, in fact, than any European or American.\r\n\r\nThis is what M. Andre, Belgian Consul-General, says of them: \"This\r\nclass is composed entirely of usurers and pawnees. All the pawn-shops\r\nand gambling-houses belong to the principal Mestizo families. There\r\nis not one family free from that stigma. In the plantations belonging\r\nto the rich families of Mestizos or Indians, the workmen are treated\r\nvery inhumanly.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Spanish Mestizos are very unpopular\r\namongst the natives, and that an uncomfortable time would await them\r\nshould the islands become independent. They are perfectly aware of\r\nthis, and in their hearts long for the protection of one of the Great\r\nPowers. At the same time, they are anxious to get the lion's share\r\nof the loaves and fishes.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Mestizos differ both in appearance and character from\r\nthe Spanish Mestizos, owning less land, and being more addicted\r\nto commercial pursuits, for which both sexes show a remarkable\r\naptitude. It is customary for the daughters, even of wealthy\r\nfamilies, to trade on their own account from an early age. A case\r\nwas mentioned to me where five dollars was given to a young girl to\r\nbegin trading. With this she purchased a pilon of sugar, and sending\r\nout some of her father's servants to the woods, collected a large\r\nquantity of guavas. She then caused the cook to make the material\r\ninto guava jelly, which she packed in tins or jars collected for the\r\npurpose. Then another servant took the jelly out for sale, and disposed\r\nof it all. The capital was soon doubled, and invested in sayas and\r\nhandkerchiefs bought at wholesale prices, which were then hawked round\r\nby a servant. Some years afterwards, I made the acquaintance of this\r\nyoung lady, and found that she was then dealing in diamond and pearl\r\njewellery, and had a large iron safe in which she kept her stock,\r\nwhich was then worth several thousand dollars, all made by her trading.\r\n\r\nChinese Mestizos are owners of cascos and lorchas for loading or\r\nunloading vessels, also of farderias, or establishments for mixing\r\nand drying sugar.\r\n\r\nIn Manila, the Sangleyes, as they are called by the Spaniards\r\nand natives, have a gobernadorcillo and tribunal of their own. In\r\nSanta Cruz they are very numerous, and amongst them are to be found\r\njewellers, silversmiths, watch-makers, or rather repairers, sculptors,\r\ngilders and painters, besides one or two dentists of good renown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE VISAYAS AND PALAWAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE VISAYAS ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n    Area and population--Panay--Negros--Cebu--Bohol--Leyte--Samar.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis name is given to the group of six considerable islands\r\nlying between Luzon and Mindanao, and also to the race inhabiting\r\nthem. Beginning at the west, these islands are Panay, Negros, Cebu,\r\nBohol, Leyte, and Samar. There are also a number of smaller islands.\r\n\r\nMany of the larger as well as the smaller islands are thickly\r\npopulated, and an extensive emigration takes place to the great and\r\nfertile island of Mindanao, where any amount of rich land waits the\r\ncoming of the husbandmen. I can find no later records of population\r\nthan the census of 1877. This may seem strange to an American,\r\nbut to those who know the ignorance and ineptitude of the Spanish\r\nadministration, it will seem a matter of course. Such data of the\r\npopulation as the Government Offices possess, are mostly due to the\r\npriests and the archbishop.\r\n\r\nSince 1877 there has undoubtedly been a great increase of population\r\namongst the Visayas, and in 1887 the population of Panay was considered\r\nto be more than a million.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas Islands contain fewer heathen than any other part of the\r\nPhilippines. In Panay there are a few Negritos and Mundos; in Negros\r\nsome Negritos and Carolanos. The illustration opposite p. 207 is a\r\nfull-length photograph of Tek Taita, a Negrito from this island. In\r\nCebu a few Mundos live around the peak of Danao. In Bohol, Leyte,\r\nand Samar there are no heathen savages.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the heathen in these islands would have died out\r\nbefore now but that they are reinforced continually by remontados,\r\nor fugitives from justice, also by people whose inclination for a\r\nsavage life, or whose love of rapine renders the humdrum life of\r\ntheir village insupportable to them.\r\n\r\nThe following Table gives the area of each of the six larger islands,\r\nand the population in 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Area in square miles.\r\n                                Population according to Census of 1877.\r\n                                                Capitals.\r\n\r\nPanay\r\n  (divided into       4,898     777,777 [29]    Capiz.\r\n  three provinces--                             Antique.\r\n  Capiz, Antique,                               Ilo-ilo.\r\n  Ilo-ilo)\r\nNegros                3,592     204,669         Bacolod.\r\nCebu                  2,285     403,296         Cebu.\r\nBohol                 1,226     226,546         Tagbilaran.\r\nLeyte                 3,706     220,515         Tacloban.\r\nSamar                 5,182     178,890         Catbalogan.\r\n                              ---------\r\n                              2,011,693\r\n\r\n\r\nPanay.--This island is approximately an equilateral triangle, with\r\nthe western edge nearly north and south, having one apex pointing\r\nsouth. A chain of mountains extends in a curved line from the northern\r\nto the southern point, enclosing an irregular strip of land which\r\nforms the province of Antique. The rivers in this part of the island\r\nare naturally short and unimportant. The northern part of the island\r\nis the province of Capiz, the principal river is the Panay, which,\r\nrising in the centre of the island, runs in a northerly direction for\r\nover thirty miles, entering the sea at the Bay of Sapian. The eastern\r\nand southern part of the island is the province of Ilo-ilo. The\r\nprincipal river is the Talana, which, rising quite near the source\r\nof the River Panay, runs in a southerly and south-easterly direction\r\ninto the channel between Negros and Panay to the north of the island of\r\nGuimaras. There are many spurs to the principal range of mountains, but\r\nbetween them is a considerable extent of land under cultivation. The\r\nprovince of Ilo-ilo is one of the richest and most densely-populated in\r\nthe Philippines. It now contains at least half a million inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIlo-ilo is open to foreign commerce, and vice-consuls of many nations\r\nreside there. Yet the port has neither wharves, cranes, moorings or\r\nlights. The coasting steamers drawing up to 13 feet enter a muddy\r\ncreek and discharge their cargo on the banks as best they can, whilst\r\nthe ocean-going ships lie out in the bay and receive their cargoes\r\nof sugar and other produce from lighters, upon each of which pilotage\r\nused to be charged for the benefit of an unnecessary number of pilots,\r\nand of the captain of the port, who received a share of the pilotage\r\nand strenuously resisted a reform of this abuse.\r\n\r\nUnder American protection, Ilo-ilo may be expected to become a\r\nflourishing port, provided with every convenience for discharging,\r\nloading, and repairing ships, as becomes the importance of its\r\ntrade. The town of Ilo-ilo contained many large buildings, some\r\nof them owned by British subjects. During the fighting last year,\r\nhowever, several buildings were burnt.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spanish rule the streets were entirely uncared for, being\r\na series of mud-holes in the rainy season, and thick with dust and\r\ngarbage in the dry season.\r\n\r\nThe town and port together are notorious examples of all the worst\r\ncharacteristics of Spanish rule.\r\n\r\nThe principal towns of this wealthy province are Pototan, Santa\r\nBarbara, Janiuay, and Cabatuan, each of which has more than 20,000\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe industries and productions of this and the other islands are\r\ntreated of under Visayas when describing the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNegros.--A long island of irregular shape, lying between Panay and\r\nCebu. Its axis is nearly north and south, and a chain of mountains\r\nruns up it, but nearer to the east than to the west coast.\r\n\r\nA little to the north of the centre of this chain, the celebrated\r\nvolcano Canlaon raises its peak over 8300 feet. It is frequently in\r\nactive eruption, and can be perceived at an immense distance when the\r\natmosphere is clear. I have seen it and its long plume of vapour from\r\na steamer when passing the north of the island.\r\n\r\nIn the Sierra de Dumaguete, a range occupying the centre of the\r\nsouthern promontory of the island, and about the centre of the range,\r\nthere is the volcano of Bacon, about which little is known.\r\n\r\nCebu is a long and narrow island something in the shape of an\r\nalligator, looked at from above, with the snout pointing to the\r\nsouthward and westward. It is opposite to Negros, and separated\r\nfrom that island by the Strait of Tanon. It is, in fact, a range of\r\nmountains rising out of the sea, and is very narrow, being nowhere\r\nmore than 22 miles wide. There being a large population of Visayas,\r\nand the mountains not being very high, the wandering heathen have to\r\na great extent been weeded out, and only a remnant of wretched Mundos\r\nremain about the crests of the cordillera.\r\n\r\nThe capital city, Cebu, was the first in the Archipelago to possess\r\na municipality, and was, in fact, until 1571, the capital of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nIt possesses some fine buildings; is the seat of a bishop, and formerly\r\nof the Governor-General of Visayas. It is open to foreign commerce,\r\nand vice-consuls of the principal nations reside there.\r\n\r\nThere can be no rivers in an island of this configuration, for the\r\nwater runs away as from the roof of a house. The crops and industries\r\nhave been spoken of under the head of Visayas.\r\n\r\nThere are considerable beds of lignite near Compostela, and various\r\nefforts have been made to work them, so far, I fear, without much\r\nsuccess. Remarkable shells, and some pearls are obtained round about\r\nCebu and the adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nBohol lies off the southern half of the eastern coast of Cebu, and\r\nis only half the size of that island, but it has more than half the\r\npopulation. It is hilly, and the towns and villages are situated\r\non the coast. Only the southern and eastern coast is visited by\r\ncoasting vessels, the navigation to the north and west being impeded\r\nby a labyrinth of coral reefs. The soil of this island is not rich,\r\nand the more enterprising of the natives emigrate to Mindanao.\r\n\r\nLeyte is an island of very irregular shape--something like a hide\r\npegged out on the ground--and lies between the northern half of Cebu\r\nand the southern part of Samar, from which it is only separated by a\r\nvery narrow passage called the Janabatas Channel, and the Strait of\r\nSan Juanico. The southern extremity of Leyte approaches the northern\r\npromontory of Mindanao, and forms the Straits of Surigao, the second\r\nentrance from the Pacific to the seas of the Archipelago. The island is\r\nmountainous, and has two lakes, one called Bito is at the narrowest\r\npart, and one called Jaro, near the town of that name. There are\r\nseveral good ports. The exports, which go to Manila, are hemp and\r\nsulphur of great purity.\r\n\r\nSamar.--This is the largest of the Visayas, and yet has fewest\r\ninhabitants. It lies to the eastward of all the other islands,\r\nand consequently its east coast, like that of Luzon and Mindanao,\r\nis exposed to the full fury of the north-east monsoon, and to the\r\nravages of the heavy rollers of the Pacific that burst without warning\r\non its rocky coast.\r\n\r\nIts chief port, Catbalogan, is situated on the western coast, and\r\nis well-sheltered. From the coast many lofty peaks are visible,\r\nbut the interior of this island is little known. The exports are\r\nhemp and cocoa-nut oil. The northern point of Samar approaches\r\nthe southern extremity of Luzon, and forms the historic Strait of\r\nSan Bernardino, one of the entrances to the Philippine Archipelago\r\nfrom the Pacific. It was by this Strait that the annual galleon from\r\nAcapulco entered, and here also the British privateers lay in wait\r\nfor their silver-laden prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nThe Visayas Race.\r\n\r\n    Appearance--Dress--Look upon Tagals as foreigners--Favourable\r\n    opinion of Tomas de Comyn--Old Christians--Constant wars with the\r\n    Moro pirates and Sea Dayaks--Secret heathen rites--Accusation of\r\n    indolence unfounded--Exports of hemp and sugar--Ilo-ilo sugar--Cebu\r\n    sugar--Textiles--A promising race.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most numerous and, after the Tagals, the most important race in\r\nthe Philippines is the Visaya, formerly called Pintados, or painted\r\nmen, from the blue painting or tattooing which was prevalent at the\r\ntime of the conquest. They form the mass of the inhabitants of the\r\nislands called Visayas and of some others.\r\n\r\nThey occupy the south coast of Masbate, the islands of Romblon,\r\nBohol, Sibuyan, Samar, and Leyte, Tablas, Panay, Negros, and Cebu,\r\nall the lesser islands of the Visayas group and the greater part of\r\nthe coast of the great island of Mindanao. In that island the Caragas,\r\na very warlike branch of the Visayas, occupy the coast of the old\r\nkingdom of Caraga on the east from Punta Cauit to Punta San Agustin.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of the Visayas distinguished by a darker colour and\r\nby a curliness of the hair, suggesting some Negrito mixture, occupies\r\nthe Calamiancs and Cuyos Islands, and the northern coasts of Paragua\r\nor Palawan as far as Bahia Honda.\r\n\r\nIn appearance the Visayas differ somewhat from the Tagals, having\r\na greater resemblance to the Malays of Borneo and Malacca. The men\r\nwear their hair longer than the Tagals, and the women wear a patadion\r\ninstead of a saya and tapis.\r\n\r\nThe patadion is a piece of cloth a yard wide and over two yards long,\r\nthe ends of which are sewn together. The wearer steps into it and wraps\r\nit round the figure from the waist downward, doubling it over in front\r\ninto a wide fold, and tucking it in securely at the waist. The saya is\r\na made skirt tied at the waist with a tape, and the tapis is a breadth\r\nof dark cloth, silk or satin, doubled round the waist over the saya.\r\n\r\nIn disposition they are less sociable and hospitable than the Tagals,\r\nand less clean in their persons and clothing. They have a language of\r\ntheir own, and there are several dialects of it. The basis of their\r\nfood is rice, with which they often mix maize. They flavour their\r\nfood with red pepper to a greater extent than the Tagals. They are\r\nexpert fishermen, and consume large quantities of fish. In smoking\r\nand chewing betel they resemble the other races of the islands. They\r\nare great gamblers, and take delight in cock-fighting. They are fond\r\nof hunting, and kill numbers of wild pig and deer. They cut the flesh\r\nof the latter into thin strips and dry it in the sun, after which it\r\nwill keep a long time. It is useful to take as provision on a journey,\r\nbut it requires good teeth to get through it.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas build a number of canoes, paraos, barotos, and vintas, and\r\nare very confident on the water, putting to sea in their ill-found and\r\nbadly-equipped craft with great assurance, and do not come to grief\r\nas often as might be expected. Their houses are similarly constructed\r\nto those of the other inhabitants of the littoral.\r\n\r\nAncient writers accused the Visaya women of great sensuality and\r\nunbounded immorality, and gave details of some very curious customs,\r\nwhich are unsuitable for general publication. However, the customs I\r\nrefer to have been long obsolete among the Visayas, although still\r\nexisting amongst some of the wilder tribes in Borneo. The Visaya\r\nwomen are very prolific, many having borne a dozen children, but\r\ninfant mortality is high, and they rear but few of them. The men\r\nare less sober than the Tagals--they manufacture and consume large\r\nquantities of strong drink. They are not fond of the Tagals, and a\r\nVisaya regiment would not hesitate to fire upon them if ordered. In\r\nfact the two tribes look upon each other as foreigners. When discovered\r\nby the Spaniards, they were to a great extent civilised and organised\r\nin a feudal system. Tomas de Comyn formed a very favourable opinion of\r\nthem--he writes, both men and women are well-mannered and of a good\r\ndisposition, of better condition and nobler behaviour than those of\r\nthe Island of Luzon and others adjacent.\r\n\r\nThey had learnt much from Arab and Bornean adventurers, especially\r\nfrom the former, whose superior physique, learning, and sanctity, as\r\ncoming from the country of the Prophet, made them acceptable suitors\r\nfor the hands of the daughters of the Rajas or petty kings. They had\r\nbrought with them the doctrines of Islam, which had begun to make\r\nsome converts before the Spanish discovery. The old Visaya religion\r\nwas not unlike that of the Tagals, they called their idols Dinatas\r\ninstead of Anitos--their marriage customs were not very different\r\nfrom those of the Tagals.\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of the Visayas were converted to Christianity at, or\r\nsoon after, the Spanish conquest. They have thus been Christians for\r\nover three centuries, and in constant war with the Mahometan pirates\r\nof Mindanao and Sulu, and with the Sea Dayaks of Borneo. However, in\r\nsome localities they still show a strong hankering after witchcraft,\r\nand practise secret heathen rites, notwithstanding the vigilance of\r\nthe parish priests.\r\n\r\nA friar of the order of Recollets who had held a benefice in Bohol,\r\nassured me that they have a secret heathen organisation, although\r\nevery member is a professing Christian, taking the Sacrament on the\r\ngreat feasts of the Church. They hold a secret triennial meeting of\r\ntheir adherents, who come over from other islands to be present. The\r\nmeeting is held in some lonely valley, or on some desert island,\r\nwhere their vessels can lie concealed, always far from any church or\r\npriest. All the Recollet could tell me about the ceremonies was that\r\nthe sacrifice of pigs formed an important part of it\r\n\r\nThe Visayas are no less credulous than the Tagals, for in Samar,\r\nduring my recollection, there have been several disturbances caused by\r\nfanatics who went about in rags, and by prayers, incoherent speeches,\r\nand self-mortification acquired a great reputation for sanctity. The\r\npoor ignorant people, deluded by these impostors, who gave themselves\r\nout to be gods, and as such, impervious to bullets, and immortal,\r\nabandoned their homes and followed these false gods wherever they went,\r\nlistening to their wild promises, and expecting great miracles. They\r\nsoon came into collision with the Guardia Civil; and on one occasion,\r\narmed only with clubs and knives, they made a determined charge on a\r\nsmall party of this corps under the command of a native officer. The\r\nGuardia Civil formed across the road and poured several steady volleys\r\ninto the advancing crowd, breaking them up and dispersing them with\r\nheavy loss and killing the false god. The native officer received\r\nthe laurel-wreathed cross of San Fernando as a reward for his services.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas are taxed with great indolence, yet they are almost the\r\nonly working people in districts which export a great quantity of\r\nproduce. Leyte and Samar produce a good many bales of excellent\r\nhemp, and it should be remembered that every bale represents at\r\nleast twelve days' hard work of one man in cleaning the fibre only,\r\nwithout counting the cultivation, conveyance to the port, pressing,\r\nbaling, and shipping.\r\n\r\nIn Negros and Panay the sugar estates are much larger than in Luzon,\r\nand mostly belong to Spaniards or mestizos. They are not worked by\r\naparceria as in Luzon, but the labourers are paid by the day. Great\r\ntroubles often occur as bands of labourers present themselves\r\non the plantations and offer to work, but demand an advance of\r\npay. Sometimes, after receiving it, they work a few days and then\r\ndepart without notice, leaving the planter in great difficulty and\r\nwithout redress. Strict laws against vagrants are urgently required\r\nin Visayas. On the other hand the planter is more free to introduce\r\nimprovements and alterations than when working by aparceria when he has\r\nto consult the inquilino or cultivator about any change. The cane-mills\r\nare much larger than in Luzon, and are mostly worked by steam engines.\r\n\r\nThe sugar is handled differently from the custom of Pampanga. Pilones\r\nare not used, and no manipulation in farderias is required to\r\nprepare it for export. The cane-juice is carefully clarified and\r\nskimmed, then boiled in open pans to a much higher point than when\r\nmaking pilon-sugar, and to get it to this point without burning or\r\nover-heating much care and experience is required.\r\n\r\nFrom the teache it is ladled into large wooden trays, always in\r\nthin layers, and is there beaten up with heavy spatulas until it\r\nbecomes, on cooling, a pale yellow amorphous mass. It is packed in\r\nmat-bags, and is then ready for shipment. It travels well and loses\r\nbut little during a Voyage to San Francisco or New York. None of it\r\ngoes to England, which is now entirely supplied by the vile beet sugar\r\n\"made in Germany,\" except for a few hundred tons of Demerara crystals\r\nimported for use by connoisseurs to sweeten their coffee.\r\n\r\nIlo-ilo sugar is shipped under three marks, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3. An\r\nassortment or cargo of this sugar should consist of 1-8th No. 1,\r\n2-8ths No. 2, 5-8ths No. 3.\r\n\r\nA representative analysis of Ilo-ilo sugar is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             No. 1.    No. 2.    No. 3.\r\n\r\n                             Per Cent. Per Cent. Per Cent.\r\n        Crystallizable sugar  86.60     84.50     81.20\r\n        Glucose                5.40      5.50      6.56\r\n        Mineral matter (ash)   1.50      2.56      3.72\r\n        Sand                  trace       .24      1.28\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Cebu the properties are small and are mostly in the hands of\r\nVisayas. There are, perhaps, five or six steam-mills, but most of the\r\ncane is ground in cattle-mills. They follow the practice of negroes\r\nin making sugars direct for export, but the produce is of a lower\r\nquality. An analysis of the Cebu sugar is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Cebu Superior.    Cebu Current.\r\n\r\n                            Per Cent.

Besides what they shipped to Manila in 1897, they exported\r\ndirectly to the United States, Great Britain, or other countries,\r\nthe following: Ilo-ilo, 127,744 tons of sugar; 51,300 piculs of Sapan\r\nwood; Cebu, 15,444 tons of sugar; 80,271 bales of hemp; 46,414 piculs\r\nof Copra. And it must be remembered that the Visayas cultivate most\r\nof the rice, maize, and other food-stuffs which they consume, and\r\nalso make their own instruments of agriculture. Besides this, Ilo-ilo\r\nexported to other parts of the Philippines a million dollars' worth of\r\ntextiles of cotton, silk, and other fibres, made by the Visayas women\r\nin hand-looms. The women in Antique make the finest pina, a beautiful\r\ntransparent texture of the utmost delicacy, woven from the fibres of\r\nthe leaves of a non-fruiting pine (ananas). When doing the finest work\r\nthey have to keep their doors and windows closed, for the least draught\r\nwould break or disarrange the delicate filaments. The export from other\r\nports in Visayas of textiles of cotton and silk is considerable, and,\r\nin addition to what they sell, the Visayas women weave most of the\r\nmaterial for their own clothing and for that of the men.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas also export mat-bags for sugar, which are called bayones;\r\nmats for sleeping on, called petates or esteras; pillows stuffed\r\nwith cotton, hides, mother-of-pearl shell, Balate (Beche de Mer),\r\nedible bird's-nests, gutta-percha, gum-dammar, wax, rattans, coffee\r\n(of indifferent quality), and leaf tobacco. Both the island of Panay\r\nand the coasts of Negros are dotted over with cane plantations.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas extract oil from cocoa-nuts and forge excellent weapons\r\nfrom scrap iron. The bands from bales of Manchester goods are much\r\nesteemed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIf we take all these points into consideration, the Visayas may not\r\nappear so deplorably indolent as they have been said to be. When\r\nwriting of the other races, I have pointed out that the indolence\r\nimputed to them rather goes beyond what is warranted by the facts.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that there are degrees in the civilisation of\r\nthe Visayas, and as amongst the Tagals and other races, considerable\r\ndifferences will be found to exist between the dwellers in the towns\r\nand those in the outlying hamlets, whilst the Remontados may be\r\nconsidered to have relapsed into savagery.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas do a certain amount of trade with the heathen hill-men\r\nof their islands, and as will be pointed out when describing these\r\ntribes, it is hard to say whether the Christian Visayas or the\r\nMahometan Malays rob these poor savages more shamefully.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas are a promising race, and I feel sure that when they have\r\na good government that will not extort too heavy taxes from them,\r\nnor allow the native and half-caste usurers to eat them up, their\r\nagriculture and industries will surprisingly increase.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Visayas that the American Government must look to provide\r\na militia that will now hold in check, and ultimately subjugate,\r\nthe piratical Moros of Mindanao and Paragua. The fighting qualities\r\nof this race, developed by centuries of combat with their Mahometan\r\naggressors in defence of hearths and homes, will be found quite\r\nsufficient if they are well armed and led to make an end of the Moro\r\npower within a very few years.\r\n\r\nThat this aspiration is one well worthy of the countrymen of Decatur,\r\nwill, I think, be admitted by all who have read my description of\r\nthe Moros under the heading of Mindanao.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nThe Island of Palawan, or Paragua.\r\n\r\n    The Tagbanuas--Tandulanos--Manguianes--Negritos--Moros of southern\r\n    Palawan--Tagbanua alphabet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Palawan, or, as it is called by the Spaniards,\r\nLa Paragua, is situated between the parallels 8 deg. 25' and 11 deg. 30'\r\nN. lat. The capital, Puerto Princesa, was founded in 1872, and is\r\nsituated on the east coast in lat. 9 deg. 45', being 354 miles from Manila,\r\n210 miles from North Borneo, and 510 miles from Singapore. Palawan is\r\nabout 250 miles long, and from 10 to 25 wide, with an area of about\r\n5833 square miles, the third in size of the Philippine Islands. There\r\nare several good ports in the northern part, which is much broken up,\r\nand its coasts studded with numerous islets, forming secure anchorages.\r\n\r\nOff the western coast is a large submarine bank, with many coral\r\nreefs and islets. The navigation on this coast is very dangerous,\r\nand can only be done in daylight.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Puerto Princesa is an excellent one, and sufficiently\r\nlarge for all requirements.\r\n\r\nLimestone and other sedimentary formations predominate. No volcanic\r\nrocks are known to exist. It is conjectured that the island has been\r\nformed by an upheaval, and it bears little resemblance geologically\r\nto any of the other Philippines. Plastic clays suitable for making\r\nbricks, tiles, and pottery, abound.\r\n\r\nNothing is known about the mineralogy, except that rock-crystal is\r\nfound, a magnificent specimen of great purity and value was sent from\r\nthe island to the Madrid Exhibition of 1887.\r\n\r\nA chain of mountains, with peaks of varying elevation up to 6500 feet,\r\nruns lengthways of the island, much nearer to the western coast than\r\nto the eastern. The descent from the summits to the eastern coast\r\nis, therefore, gradual, and on the western coast it is abrupt. Mount\r\nStaveley, Mount Beaufort (3740 feet), Pico Pulgar (4330 feet), and\r\nthe Peaks of Anepalian, are in the central part of the island.\r\n\r\nThe following record is taken from the observations made by Captain\r\nCanga-Arguelles, a former governor, during his residence of three\r\nyears in Puerto Princesa.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Month.

The force of the monsoon is much spent when it arrives\r\non the coast of Paragua, and the typhoons only touch the northern\r\nextremity of the island.\r\n\r\nVolcanic phenomena are unknown, and there is no record of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nFrom the lay of the island there is always one coast with calm water,\r\nwhichever way the monsoon is blowing.\r\n\r\nThe troops and civil population of Puerto Princesa suffer to some\r\nextent from intermittent fevers; but the reports of the military,\r\nnaval, and civil infirmaries, state that the disease is not very\r\nsevere, and that it yields to treatment, and this assertion is\r\nconfirmed by the reports of the French travellers, Drs. Montano and\r\nRey and M. Alfred Marche.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of the island has been colonised from the other\r\nPhilippines, and the Christian inhabitants number about 10,000\r\ndistributed amongst several small villages. The southern coasts are\r\noccupied by Mahometan Malays, who number about 6000, and the rest\r\nof this large island, except Puerta Princesa, is only populated by\r\nsavages, the principal tribes being the--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tagbuanas, estimated to number          6,000\r\n        Tandulanos, estimated to number         1,500\r\n        Negritos, estimated to number             500\r\n        Manguianes, estimated to number         4,000\r\n                                              --------\r\n                                               12,000\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gives a grand total of 28,000 inhabitants, or 5.6 to the\r\nsquare mile. In the island of Luzon, in which extensive districts\r\nare uncultivated and unexplored, the mean density of the population\r\nin 1875, was 76.5 per square mile, and in the provinces of Batangan\r\nand Pasgasinan, which are, perhaps, the best cultivated, the density\r\nwas 272 inhabitants to the square mile.\r\n\r\nThe fauna has been studied to some extent, a French collector having\r\nresided for a considerable period on the island. It comprises monkeys,\r\npigs, civets, porcupines, flying squirrels, pheasants, and a small\r\nleopard, this latter not found in any other of the Philippines,\r\nand showing a connection with Borneo.\r\n\r\nThe island is covered with dense forests, which have been little\r\nexplored.\r\n\r\nThe Inspeccion de Montes (Department of Woods and Forests) gives a\r\nlist of 104 different kinds of forest-trees known to be growing there,\r\nand states that ebony abounds there more than in any other province\r\nof the Philippines. According to Wallace, the camphor-tree is found\r\nin the island.\r\n\r\nAmongst the timbers mentioned in the Woods and Forests lists are\r\nebony, camagon, teak, cedar, dungon, banaba, guijo, molave, and\r\nmany others of value. The forest or jungle-produce will comprise:\r\ncharcoal, firewood, bamboos, rattans, nipa (attap), orchids, wax,\r\ngums, resins, and camphor. Edible birds'-nests are found in various\r\nlocalities. Fish is abundant in the waters, and balate (Beche de mer)\r\nis collected on the shores and reefs.\r\n\r\nPuerto Princesa is visited by a mail steamer from Manila once in\r\ntwenty-eight days. A garrison of two companies of infantry was kept\r\nthere, and several small gun-boats were stationed there, which went\r\nperiodically round the island. Piracy was completely suppressed,\r\nand the Mahometan Malays were kept in good order by the Spanish forces.\r\n\r\nThe dense primeval forests which have existed for ages, untouched\r\nby the hand of man, undevastated by typhoons, volcanic eruptions, or\r\nearthquakes, must necessarily have produced an enormous quantity of\r\ndecayed vegetable matter, rich in humus, and such a soil on a limestone\r\nsubsoil, mixed with the detritus washed down from the mountains, may\r\nreasonably be expected to be of the highest fertility, and, perhaps,\r\nto be equal to the richest lands of the earth, most specially for\r\nthe cultivation of tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe varied climates to be found from the sea-level to the tops of the\r\nmountains should allow the cultivation of maize, rice, sugar-cane,\r\ncotton, cacao, coffee, and hemp, each in the zone most favourable\r\nto its growth and fruitfulness. The exemption from typhoons enjoyed\r\nby this region is most important as regards the cultivation of\r\nthe aborescent species, and the cocoa-nut palm would prove highly\r\nremunerative on land not suited for other crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTagbanuas.\r\n\r\nThe Tagbanuas are said to be the most numerous of the inhabitants of\r\nPalawan. I understand that this word comes from Taga, an inhabitant,\r\nand banua, country, and therefore means an original inhabitant of\r\nthe country, as opposed to later arrivals.\r\n\r\nThey inhabit the district between Inagahuan, on the east coast,\r\nand Ulugan and Apurahuan, on the west coast. Their numbers in 1888\r\nwere estimated at 6000. In 1890 I spent ten days amongst these\r\npeople, and employed a number of them as porters to carry my tent,\r\nprovisions, and equipment, when travelling on foot through the\r\nforests to report on the value of a concession in the neighbourhood\r\nof Yuahit and Inagahuan. I therefore describe them from personal\r\nknowledge. They are of a yellowish colour, and generally similar to\r\nthe Mahometan Malays of Mindanao. Those who have settled down and\r\ncultivated land have a robust and healthy appearance; but those who\r\nare nomadic, mostly suffered from skin diseases, and some were quite\r\nemaciated. Their Maestro de Campo, the recognised head of their tribe,\r\nlived near Inagahuan, and I visited him at his house, and found him\r\nquite communicative through an interpreter.\r\n\r\nMaestro de Campo is an obsolete military rank in Spain, and a\r\ncommission granting this title and an official staff, is sometimes\r\nconferred by the Governor-General of the Philippines, or even by\r\nthe King of Spain, upon the chiefs of heathen tribes, who have\r\nsupported the Spanish forces against the pirates of Sulu, Mindanao,\r\nor Palawan. Sometimes a small pension accompanies the title.\r\n\r\nI also learnt much about the Tagbanuas from a solitary missionary,\r\na member of the Order of Recollets, Fray Lorenzo Zapater, who had\r\nresided more than two years amongst them, and had built a primitive\r\nsort of church at Inagahuan.\r\n\r\nThey are sociable and pacific; their only weapons are the cerbatana,\r\nor blow-pipe, with poisoned darts, and bows and arrows, for the knives\r\nthey carry are tools and not weapons. They do not make war amongst\r\nthemselves, but formerly fought sometimes to defend their possessions\r\nagainst the piratical Mahometans, who inhabit the southern part of the\r\nisland. These heartless robbers, for centuries made annual raids upon\r\nthem, carrying off the paddy they had stored for their subsistence,\r\nand everything portable worth taking. They seized the boys for slaves,\r\nto cultivate their lands, and the girls for concubines, killing the\r\nadults who dared to resist them. However, since the establishment of\r\na naval station and the penal colony at Puerto Princesa in 1872, the\r\ncoast has been patrolled by the Spanish gun-boats and the piratical\r\nincursions have come to an end. The nomadic Tagbanuas, both men and\r\nwomen, were quite naked, except for a cloth (tapa-rabo) which the men\r\nwore, whilst the women wore a girdle, from which hung strips of bark or\r\nskin reaching nearly to the knees. Round their necks they wore strings\r\nof coloured beads, a turquoise blue seemed to be the favourite kind,\r\nand on their arms and ankles, bangles made of brass wire. Coming out\r\nof the forest into a clearing where there were two small huts built in\r\nthe usual manner, and another constructed in the fork of a large tree,\r\nI found a group of these people threshing paddy. Amongst them were two\r\nyoung women with figures of striking symmetry, who, on being called by\r\nthe interpreter, approached my party without the slightest timidity or\r\nembarrassment, although wearing only the fringed girdle. I learnt that\r\nthey had both been baptized but on asking the taller girl her name,\r\ninstead of answering me, she turned to her companion and said to her,\r\n\"What is my name?\" to which the other answered, \"Ursula.\" I then asked\r\nthe shorter girl her name, and she also, instead of answering me, asked\r\nthe other girl, \"What is my name?\" to which the taller one answered,\r\n\"Margarita.\" These names had recently been given them instead of their\r\nheathen names, and I could not be sure whether they had forgotten\r\ntheir new names or whether, as is the case in several tribes, they must\r\nnever pronounce their own names nor the names of their ancestors. They\r\nthankfully accepted a cigarette each, which they immediately lighted.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday, these girls came to Mass at the Inagahuan\r\nChurch, completely dressed like Tagal women, and although they passed\r\nin front of me, I did not recognize them until I was told, for they\r\nlooked much shorter.\r\n\r\nWhen the missionary accompanied me to visit any of these people,\r\nI observed that as we approached a house the people were hurriedly\r\nputting on their clothes to receive us, but they were evidently more\r\nat ease in the garb of Adam before the fall.\r\n\r\nThe Tagbanuas have no strong religious convictions, and can be easily\r\npersuaded to allow their children to be baptised. The population of\r\nInagahuan and Abortan at the time of my visit was, according to the\r\nmissionary, 1080, of whom 616 were baptised. But from this number\r\nmany had been taken away by their half-caste or Chinese creditors\r\nto Lanugan, a visita of Trinitian, to collect wax and almaciga--the\r\nforests near Inagahuan and Yuahit being entirely exhausted. The\r\nheathen Tagbanuas believe in future rewards and punishment, and call\r\nthe infernal regions basaud. They believe in a Great Spirit, the\r\ncreator and preserver, who presides over all the important acts of\r\nlife. They call him Maguindose, and make offerings to him of rice and\r\nfish. Polygamy is allowed amongst them, but from what I saw is not\r\nmuch practised. When a Tagbanua proposes marriage to the object of\r\nhis affections, he leaves at the door of her hut the fresh trunk of\r\na banana plant. If she delays answering till the trunk has withered,\r\nhe understands this as a negative, and the damsel is spared the pain\r\nof verbally refusing; but if she approves of his suit, she sends him\r\nher answer in good time.\r\n\r\nThe lover then conveys to the house of the bride's parents, where\r\nall her relations are assembled, large baskets of boiled rice. He\r\ntakes a morsel of this and places it in the mouth of the girl, she\r\nthen does the same to him, and by this symbolic act they assume the\r\nresponsibilities of matrimony. This particular ceremony is common to\r\nmany Philippine tribes. The remainder of the cooked rice furnishes\r\nthe basis of the marriage feast.\r\n\r\nThey are said to cruelly punish adultery; on the other hand, divorce\r\nis easily obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen one of their number is very ill, they get up a concert (?) of\r\ngongs and drums with the hope of curing him, and during the performance\r\nnobody must approach the patient's couch. I could not learn whether\r\nthe music was intended to cheer up the sick person, or to frighten\r\naway the evil spirit, which they look upon as the cause of his malady;\r\nbut I incline to the latter belief, because the so-called music is\r\ncalculated to frighten away any living thing.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the patient does not improve, he is then consulted as\r\nto where he would like to be buried, and about other details of the\r\nceremony and funeral feast. This reminds me that I have read of a\r\nScotchwoman consulting her dying husband as to whether the scones\r\nto be made for his funeral should be square or round. Such, however,\r\nis the custom of the Tagbanuas.\r\n\r\nImmediately after death the relatives place by the corpse the weapons\r\nand effects belonging to the deceased and sprinkle ashes on the floor\r\nall around--then they retire and leave the dead alone for a time. Later\r\non, they return and carefully examine the ashes to see whether the\r\nsoul of the defunct, when abandoning the body, left any foot-marks.\r\n\r\nThen, forming a circle round the dead, they chant a dirge in honour\r\nof the departed, after which they commit his body to the earth in the\r\nmidst of his cleared land, unless he has selected some other spot,\r\nburying with him his arms and utensils, not forgetting the wood-knife\r\nand a liberal ration of cooked rice and condiments for his journey\r\nto the other world. They then abandon both hut and land and never\r\nreturn to it. They bury small children in jars called basinganis.\r\n\r\nI was much interested in these people, and felt a great pity for\r\nthem. All energy and determination seemed to have been crushed out\r\nof them by centuries of oppression from their predatory neighbours,\r\nand when at last the Spanish gun-boats delivered them from these\r\nperiodical attacks, they were held in what was practically slavery by\r\ntheir half-caste or Chinese creditors. The respectability of a Tagbanua\r\nis measured by the weight of gongs he possesses, just as the importance\r\nof a Malay pirate-chief depends on the weight of brass-guns he owns.\r\n\r\nThe half-castes, or Chinese, will supply them with a brass-gong worth,\r\nsay $5, for which they charge them thirty dollars to account. This must\r\nbe paid in almaciga (gum-dammar) at $5 per picul. Consequently the poor\r\nsavage has to supply six piculs of almaciga. Now this gum was worth $12\r\nper picul in Singapore, and the freight was trifling. Consequently the\r\nsavage pays the greedy half-caste, or avaricious Chinaman, $72 worth\r\nof gum (less expenses) for a $5 gong, and these rascally usurers take\r\ncare that the savage never gets out of their debt as long as he lives,\r\nand makes his sons take over his debt when he dies. These terms are\r\nconsidered very moderate indeed; when I come to speak of Mindanao\r\nI shall quote some much more striking trade figures. Many of the\r\ntraders there would think it very bad business to get only $72 for\r\ngoods costing $5.\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of being allowed to till their land, these people\r\nare hurried off to the most distant and least accessible forests to\r\ndig for almaciga. This gum is found in crevices in the earth amongst\r\nthe roots of secular trees. I was assured that deposits had been found\r\nof 25 piculs in one place--more than a ton and a half, but such finds\r\nare rare, as the gum is now scarce. The savage has to hide or guard his\r\ntreasure when found, and he or his family must transport it on their\r\nbacks for twenty, thirty, or forty miles, as the case may be, making\r\nrepeated journeys to deliver it to their creditor. I think this hard\r\nwork, and want of good food, explains the emaciation I noticed amongst\r\nthese people. Some few of them were not in debt. Near Inagahuan, I\r\nfound a man named Amasa who had a small cane-field, and was at work\r\nsqueezing the cane with a great lever-press, which reminded me of\r\nthe wine-presses in Teneriffe. The lever was made of the trunk of a\r\ntree; the fulcrum was a growing tree, whilst the pressing block was a\r\ntree-stump hollowed at the top. The juice was boiled to a thick syrup,\r\nand found a ready sale in the neighbourhood. Amasa was the biggest\r\nand strongest man I saw amongst the Tagbanuas, and stood five feet\r\nnine inches high. He possessed a comfortable house and clothes,\r\nyet he accompanied me on one of my journeys as a porter, but the\r\nexposure at night was too much for him, and he had an attack of fever\r\nwhen he returned. Near Amasa lived a Christian woman named Ignacia,\r\na widow. She had lived ten years in one place, and had an abundant\r\nsupply of paddy stored in huge baskets in her house. She also had a\r\nplantation of cacao trees, many of them in full bearing. They were\r\nrather neglected, but had grown remarkably. I bought some of her\r\nproduce for my own use.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find that the Tagbanuas could read and write;\r\none day I observed a messenger hand to one of them a strip of bark\r\nwith some figures scratched on it, which the latter proceeded to\r\nread, and on inquiring from the missionary, I learnt that they had\r\nan alphabet of sixteen or seventeen letters. I obtained a copy of\r\nthis from the Padre Zapater, and it will be found on page 319. They\r\ndo not use a pen, but scratch the letters with the point of a knife,\r\nor with a nail, or thorn.\r\n\r\nThe Tagbanuas are very fond of music and dancing. On the evening of\r\nmy arrival at Yuahit, a collection of about a dozen huts with forty\r\ninhabitants, they gave an open-air performance in my honour. My party\r\nconsisted of a boat's-crew of eight Tagal sailors of the Navy, two\r\nservants, an interpreter, and two companions. The orchestra consisted\r\nof four brass gongs of varying sizes, and a tom-tom. Torches were stuck\r\nin the ground to illuminate the scene, and the whole of the inhabitants\r\nof the hamlet turned out and watched the proceedings with greatest\r\ninterest. The dances were performed by men, women, and children,\r\none at a time, and were perfectly modest and graceful. The women were\r\ndressed in shirts and bright-coloured patadions, and were adorned with\r\nsilver rings, brass bangles, and armlets, some had strings of beads\r\nround their necks. The best dance was performed by a young woman,\r\nholding in each hand a piece of a branch of the bread-fruit tree,\r\nwhich they call Rima, with two of the large handsome leaves. These\r\nshe waved about very gracefully in harmony with her movements. The\r\nspectators behaved very well, and were careful not to crowd round me. I\r\nrewarded the dancers with beads and handkerchiefs, and the musicians\r\nwith cigars. This dancing seemed to me a very innocent amusement,\r\nbut I was sorry to find that the missionary took a different view. He\r\nassociated the dances with heathen rites and forbade them, confiscating\r\nthe dearly-bought gongs of his converts, as he said they were used\r\nto call up evil spirits. However, I observed that he had hung up the\r\nlargest gong to serve as a church-bell, after having sprinkled it with\r\nholy water. I remembered having read how the Moravian missionaries\r\nin Greenland put a stop to the dancing which formerly enlivened the\r\nlong dark winter of that desolate region, and I asked myself why the\r\nChristian missionary, whether teaching in the icy gloom of the Arctic\r\ncircle, or in brilliant sunshine on a palm-fringed strand, must forbid\r\nhis converts to indulge in such a healthful and harmless recreation,\r\nin both cases almost the sole possible amusement. I could see no reason\r\nwhy the heathen should have all the fun. The labours of the missionary\r\nwere, however, very much to the benefit of the Tagbanuas, as inducing\r\nthem to settle down, build houses, and raise crops for their support.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish gun-boats had stopped the inroads of Moros by sea, and\r\ndetachments of native troops along the coast stopped the raiding by\r\nland. For twenty years the Tagbanuas had suffered little, and for\r\nseveral years absolutely nothing from the Moros, yet they apparently\r\ncould not realise their security, and were afraid to accumulate\r\nanything lest it should be taken from them. To the ravages of the\r\npirate, there has succeeded the extortion of the usurer, and John\r\nChinaman waxes fat whilst the wretched Tagbanua starves.\r\n\r\nWhilst travelling through the jungle I found some natives cutting\r\ncanes, and my interpreter pointed out to me an emaciated couple, and\r\nassured me that during the famine of the previous season, these poor\r\nwretches had killed and eaten their own child to save their lives. What\r\na state of things in a country where maize will grow up and give edible\r\ngrain in forty-two days from the date of planting it! I trust that the\r\nchange of government may result in some benefit to these poor people,\r\nand that a Governor or Protector of Aborigines may be appointed with\r\nabsolute power who will check the abuses of the half-caste and Chinese\r\nusurers, and give the poor down-trodden Tagbanuas, at one time I firmly\r\nbelieve a comparatively civilised people, a chance to live and thrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTandulanos.\r\n\r\nThe Tandulanos are physically similar to the Negritos, but less\r\nrobust. They inhabit the shores of Palawan, being scattered along\r\nthe western coast between the Bay of Malampaya and Caruray. They\r\nare more savage than the other races of the island, but they fulfil\r\ntheir engagements with rigorous exactness. They make rough canoes,\r\nand subsist principally on fish and shell-fish, and they do no\r\ncultivation. They are very skilful in the use of the harpoon which\r\nthey employ for fishing. If they can obtain iron, they use it for\r\ntheir harpoon-points, otherwise they point them with the spike from\r\nthe tail of a skate.\r\n\r\nThey use a most active poison on their harpoons and darts, so much so,\r\nthat it is said to produce almost instantaneous death.\r\n\r\nThis poison is unknown to the other tribes. They refuse to sell their\r\ncerbatanas, or blow-pipes, from which they shoot their darts.\r\n\r\nThey are said to intermarry indiscriminately, without regard to\r\nkinship. Their number was computed at 1500 in the year 1888, and they\r\nare probably not much more numerous now.\r\n\r\nThese people are, like the Negritos, whom they resemble, a hopeless\r\nrace, not capable of advancing in civilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManguianes and Negritos of Palawan.\r\n\r\nThese people have been described under the heading Aetas or Negritos,\r\nin Part I. The first-named inhabit the interior of that part of the\r\nisland occupied by the Moros who jealously prevent them from holding\r\nany intercourse with strangers.\r\n\r\nMoros of Southern Palawan.--These people do not differ in any essential\r\nparticular from the Moros of Mindanao. They look back with regret on\r\nthe good old days before the advent of the steam gun-boats, and the\r\nestablishment of the fortified posts along their shores when they\r\ncould make their annual raids and massacre, plunder, and enslave,\r\nthe wretched Tagbanuas without interference. They will doubtless take\r\nfull advantage of any negligence of the United States authorities to\r\nkeep up the gun-boat flotilla, and to maintain the military posts.\r\n\r\nThey now live by agriculture, all the labour being performed by\r\nslaves, and by trading with the savages of the mountains, vying with\r\nthe Christians in usurious rapacity.\r\n\r\nJohn Chinaman in Palawan is just the same as his brother in Mindanao--a\r\nremorseless usurer, and a skilful manipulator of false weights and\r\nmeasures, but no worse in the treatment of the unhappy aboriginal\r\nthan the Christian native or half-caste.\r\n\r\nPuerto Princesa, the capital, had a population at the time of my\r\nvisit in 1890 of about 1500, of which number 1200 were males and 300\r\nfemales. About half the males were soldiers and sailors, one-fourth\r\nconvicts, and the remainder civilians. Most of the women had been\r\ndeported from Manila as undesirable characters in that decorous\r\ncity. Notwithstanding their unsavoury antecedents, they found new\r\nhusbands or protectors in Puerto Princesa the moment they landed. Such\r\nwas the competition for these very soiled doves, that most of them\r\nhad made their new arrangements before leaving the jetty alongside\r\nwhich the steamer they arrived in lay.\r\n\r\nThere was some little cultivation round about the capital, but as\r\nusual trading with the aborigines for gum, rattans, balate, green\r\nsnail-shells, and other jungle produce was the most entrancing pursuit.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the town was a Government Sugar Plantation,\r\nwhich I visited. If sugar planting could flourish anywhere, it surely\r\nshould have done so here, for the land cost nothing, the convicts\r\ndid all the unskilled labour and the machinery was paid for by the\r\nGovernment. Yet the blighting influence of the official mind succeeded\r\neven here in causing the place to be run at a loss. The sugar badly\r\nprepared was shipped to Manila to be sold at a reduced price, and\r\nsugar for the troops and general use was imported from other parts.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the island, during the later period of Spanish rule,\r\nhas usually been a naval officer, and as the communications are\r\nprincipally by sea, and any punitive operations have to be performed\r\nby the gun-boat flotilla, this would seem to be a precedent the United\r\nStates might follow with advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTagbanua Alphabet.\r\n\r\nCommunicated to F. H. Sawyer by Fray Lorenzo Zapater, Missionary at\r\nInagahuan, Palawan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tagbanua Alphabet.]\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B.--The Roman letters are to be pronounced as in Spanish and the\r\nTagbanua correspondingly, Ah, bay, say, day, aye or ee, o or oo, pay,\r\nku, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes by the Padre Zapater.\r\n\r\n(Translation.)\r\n\r\n1. The consonants in the Tagbanua alphabet are eleven and sometimes\r\ntwelve, but the vowels are three, since the ia and the oa which\r\nare vowels, are compound letters, although strictly they may be\r\nconsidered as vowels, but the ia and the ua are written the same,\r\nas has been said.\r\n\r\n2. In reading the Tagbanua alphabet, you begin from the bottom upwards.\r\n\r\n3. To write the consonants with their vowels, for example, ba, be,\r\nbi, bo, bu, you put a dash at the right or left. If on the right,\r\nit means be, bi, and if on the left of the consonant bo, bu.\r\n\r\nN.B.--Father Zapater's note 3 is somewhat obscure, or rather badly\r\nexpressed. It perhaps ought to have been said that a dash right and\r\nleft means ba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nMINDANAO, INCLUDING BASILAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nBRIEF GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\n    Configuration--Mountains--Rivers--Lakes--Division into\r\n    districts--Administration--Productions--Basilan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMindanao is of a very irregular shape, which it is not easy to\r\ndescribe. It has some resemblance to a winged skate, with a long tail,\r\none of the Raiidae, which is common in Manila Bay. The head of the skate\r\nis turned to the east; the peninsula of Surigao forms the northern\r\nwing, and Punta Panguian the tip of the southern wing, out of which,\r\nhowever, a great piece has been bitten, corresponding to the Gulf of\r\nDavao. The body is represented by the main part of the island, and\r\nthe tail commences at the isthmus of Tucuran and stretches westward\r\nfor a degree of longitude. This straight part is the old kingdom of\r\nSibuguey. On the north of it, however, a huge excrescence appears; this\r\nis the peninsula of Dapitan, and on the south, opposite to it, there is\r\na similar projection, which is cut in two by the Gulf of Dumanquilas.\r\n\r\nMt. Silingan represents the spike or hook usually found on the tails of\r\nthese fish, and from here the tail bends southward and westward through\r\nan arc of 60 deg. This part represents the peninsula of Zamboanga, and\r\nthe town of that name is situated at the tip of the tail. A continuous\r\nchain of mountains down the centre of the tail represents the vertebrae.\r\n\r\nBeginning on the east, we find a long stretch of coast from Surigao to\r\nCape San Agustin with only one or two anchorages for small vessels. The\r\nrest of the coast is exposed to the full force of the Pacific Ocean,\r\nand from November to April is quite open to the N.E. monsoon. It is\r\nalso subject to tidal waves or rollers just as are the coasts of Peru\r\nand Chili. A destructive bore enters the river mouths and inlets,\r\nand heavy seas get up off all the headlands. In the channels between\r\nSurigao and the islands off the northern coasts, rapid currents\r\nare formed and overfalls render navigation dangerous for country\r\nvessels. In fact, during the strength of the N.E. monsoon the east\r\ncoast, from Placer to the Bay of Mayo, is hemmed in with surf, and\r\nwithout a single port. Behind point Taucanan, however, is found Port\r\nBalete and Port Pujada. This latter is the best port in the island,\r\nbeing well sheltered from the N. and N.E. The country about it is well\r\nwatered, and produces timber trees of great size and fine quality. The\r\nwaters contain plenty of fish, and turtle, also some mother-of-pearl\r\nshells. The forests give the best kinds of almaciga, and wax.\r\n\r\nThe hill-men are partly independent but pacific, and the Visaya\r\npopulation is considerable in the district of Mati.\r\n\r\nIn general, the east coast is rocky, and very foul in many\r\nplaces. The land is fertile and well-wooded. Gold is found in the\r\nCordillera, and on its eastern slopes all the way from Surigao to\r\nPunta Tagobong. One of the northern towns is called Placer on this\r\naccount. The inaccessibility of the east coast during the strength\r\nof the N.E. monsoon has retarded the civilisation of Surigao which\r\nwas settled in the early years of the conquest. The Caraga-Visaya,\r\nwho inhabit a considerable district on this coast, are old Christians\r\nand have always been ready to fight for their faith.\r\n\r\nPractically parallel to this coast is a chain of mountains which\r\nbegins at Surigao and extends down to Punta San Agustin with hardly\r\na break. I shall call this the eastern Cordillera. In this chain,\r\nnear the northern end, lies Lake Mainit (Hot Lake), having steep sides\r\nwith twenty fathoms close to the edge, and two hundred fathoms in the\r\nmiddle. This cavity has, no doubt, been formed by volcanic action,\r\nlike the lake of Taal. On the slopes of the mountains around it are\r\nmany thermal springs which run into the lake, and in rainy weather the\r\nsummits are always shrouded in vapour by the evaporation of the rain.\r\n\r\nThe lake is subject to tremendous floods. Dr. Montano, who visited\r\nit in December, 1880, speaks of a rise of twelve fathoms. He also\r\nsays that a ground-swell gets up in this sheltered lake; this must\r\nbe from some modified volcanic action still going on. As usual in\r\nPhilippine crater-lakes, this is a great breeding-place for alligators.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Cordillera being so near the coast, there are of course\r\nno navigable rivers running into the Pacific, but the streams become\r\nimpassable torrents during the heavy rains which begin in June, and\r\nprevent communication by land for many days or even weeks at a stretch.\r\n\r\nApproximately parallel to the Eastern Cordillera, and at about\r\nfifty geographical miles distance, there stands another range which\r\nI shall call the Central Cordillera. A line drawn from Punta Diuata\r\nto the middle of the Gulf of Sarangani, nearly due north and south,\r\nintersects Mt. Sinalagao, Mt. Panamoyan, the active volcano, Mt. Apo\r\nand Mt. Matutuan, which appear to be the loftiest peaks of the range.\r\n\r\nFrom Mt. Panamoyan in about 7 deg. 50' N. Lat. a spur strikes eastwards at\r\nright angles to the range, reaching half-way across the valley. This\r\nspur then turns to the south parallel to the range for some twenty\r\nmiles, and from the middle of the east and west part, another spur\r\nturns south for about 20 miles, thus forming a letter E with the\r\npoints looking south.\r\n\r\nIn the wide valley between the Eastern and Central Cordilleras, and\r\ntaking the drainage of the whole watershed is the River Agusan. Rising\r\nabout the 7th parallel on the slopes of Mt. Tagoppo, this river runs\r\na very sinuous course in a general northerly direction, but inclining\r\nslightly to the west, receiving innumerable tributaries on either\r\nside. At about 8 deg. 15' N. Lat. the Agusan expands or overflows, forming\r\na series of shallow lakes, choked up with driftwood and vegetation,\r\nand varying in extent with the rainfall.\r\n\r\nContinually gathering volume, it runs into the Bay of Butuan about 9 deg.\r\nN. Lat.\r\n\r\nAt Moncayo, in 7 deg. 45' N. Lat., the Agusan is one hundred yards wide,\r\nand is navigable for canoes even much higher up.\r\n\r\nThe spur previously spoken of as striking east and south from\r\nMt. Panamoyan, forms two small watersheds. The western one gives rise\r\nto the River Libaganon, and the eastern to the River Salug. Both these\r\nrivers run in a southerly direction, and unite to form the River Tagum,\r\nwhich runs for a short distance S.E. and falls into the head of the\r\nGulf of Davao.\r\n\r\nA little way south of Mt. Panamoyan some mountain streams dash down\r\nthe sides of the Cordillera and running through a gap unite to form\r\nthe River Davao which flows in a south-easterly direction till it\r\nreaches the plain, when it changes its course and runs east into the\r\nGulf of Davao. From Point Sipaca, in 9 deg. N. Lat., a range of mountains\r\nstretches in a southerly direction for about sixty miles. Amongst\r\nthese are Mt. Sipaca, Mt. Saorag, and Mt. Quimanquil. With the\r\nCentral Cordillera this range forms a watershed, and the torrents\r\non the steep sides of Sinalagao and Quimanquil dash down and take\r\na southerly direction to form the headwaters of the River Pulangui\r\nand ultimately become the Rio Grande. In 7 deg. 50' N. Lat. two important\r\naffluents join, the River Sauaga and the River Malupati, a few miles\r\nlower the Calibatojan and the Kaya-Kaya bring their tribute, and the\r\nunited flood with rapid current casts itself headlong into the deep\r\nCanon of Locosocan and runs in this for over four miles to Salagalpon,\r\nwhere another cataract occurs. The river continues for miles a rushing\r\ntorrent amongst huge boulders, at the bottom of this cleft, so narrow\r\nin places, where the rocks jut out and nearly meet overhead, that it\r\nseems like a tunnel. In 7 deg. 46' N. Lat. there is a small volcano close\r\nto the left bank which, whenever it rains, becomes active and gives\r\noff stifling fumes of sulphur. At Mantanil, in 7 deg. 40' N., the river\r\ncan be navigated on bamboo rafts, handled by skilled Manobo pilots,\r\nbut not without much risk; for some distance down there are two buchis,\r\nor sinks, where the water runs down into subterraneous passages through\r\nthe river-bed, forming dangerous whirlpools. There are also several\r\nrapids which require great dexterity to pass safely. The banks are\r\nstill high; but, on approaching the confluence of the Kulaman river,\r\non the left bank, the gorge is much lower, and on arriving at Ilang\r\nthe country opens out.\r\n\r\nSouth of the confluence of the River Molita, vintas can navigate\r\nthe river, and a little lower down, at the confluence of the River\r\nSimuni, is the place reached by the gunboat Taal in 1863 on a 6-foot\r\ndraught. The river now runs in a southerly and westerly direction,\r\nwith dozens of bends till about 6 deg. 45' N. Lat., when, on reaching\r\nLake Liguasan (really a Pinag) a shallow and weedy expanse of water,\r\nit turns to the west, and then north-west. At Tumbao it bifurcates,\r\nand enters the Bay of Illana by two mouths forming a long narrow\r\ndelta of deep and rich alluvial soil.\r\n\r\nFrom Tumbao to Tamontaca is the most beautiful and fertile part of\r\nthis river. On both banks grow cocoa-palms, areca-palms, banana and\r\ncacao-trees, coffee-bushes, and hemp plants in abundance, and amongst\r\nthem are groups of native houses forming a continuous village,\r\nof which the placid river, here fifty yards wide, forms the main\r\nstreet. These houses are mostly occupied by friendly Moros.\r\n\r\nNearly parallel to the Sipaca-Soarag-Quimanquil range a second\r\nrange stretches irregularly in a north and south line, ending at the\r\ncoast near Cagayan. Amongst these mountains is Mt Quitanglag. From\r\nPt. Sulanan the western extremity of the Bay of Macajalar, a third\r\nrange stretches south, then south-east, then south again for some\r\nthirty miles. Between this range and the Bay of Iligan there is\r\na fourth range of hills. These four ranges form three valleys or\r\nwatersheds, each of which has its river, with a general course from\r\nsouth to north, all three running into the Bay of Macajalar.\r\n\r\nThe most easterly is the River of Tagoloan which has fourteen\r\ntributaries, the next is the River Cagayan with only three, then the\r\nRiver Capay with seven tributaries, all on the left bank.\r\n\r\nProceeding westward we come to the great and deep Lake of Lanao,\r\ndescribed under the heading Moros, but which has never been surveyed,\r\nand then to the Gulf of Panguil, which, on the map, looks like a\r\nforearm and clenched fist, which nearly cuts Mindanao in two. The\r\nisthmus is only fourteen miles across in a straight line.\r\n\r\nThis was formerly a regular pirates' track, over which they hauled\r\ntheir vessels, but it was till lately guarded by a chain of forts\r\nconnected by a military road called the Trocha of Tucuran.\r\n\r\nTwo rivers running in a general direction from west to east and having\r\nbetween them a dozen tributaries, run into the Gulf of Panguil. The\r\nmost northerly of the two is the Mipangi and the other is the Lintogo.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the peninsula of Sibuguey which I have likened\r\nto the tail of the skate. Around Lake Lanao there is an irregular\r\nloop of hills, and from the western end of this starts a cordillera\r\nwhich stretches right down the centre of the peninsula of Sibuguey\r\nand Zamboanga. A line drawn from Punta Sicayati (in the Dapitan\r\nexcrescence) to the eastern shore of the Gulf of Dumanquilas will\r\nintersect a range of mountains which cross the Cordillera of Sibuguey\r\nnearly at right angles and with equal arms north and south. But the end\r\nof the northern arm bifurcates and throws out two ranges N.E. and N.W.\r\n\r\nIn the watershed thus formed three rivers take their rise, and have\r\na general course from south to north but bearing a little to the\r\nwestward. The easternmost of these is called the Dapitan, and runs\r\ninto the bay of the same name. The next is the Dipolog, which runs\r\ninto the sea west of Punta Sicayab; and the last is the Lubungan,\r\nrunning in about two leagues more to the west.\r\n\r\nThe other rivers in the peninsula are so unimportant that I do not\r\nenumerate them. Like those on the east coast they become raging\r\ntorrents in the rainy season.\r\n\r\nOn the northern and southern coasts, which are more protected than the\r\neastern, sheltered anchorages are to be found here and there, but no\r\nsuch fine natural harbours exist as abound in Southern Luzon. There is,\r\nhowever, less need for them, as it is very rare that the typhoons,\r\nwhich are so destructive in Luzon and the Visayas, cause damage in\r\nMindanao, except at its northern and eastern corner. But for service\r\non these coasts, vessels of a light draught of water are the most\r\nuseful, as they can more easily find sheltered anchorage.\r\n\r\nMindanao is not nearly so unhealthy as is commonly supposed. Zamboanga\r\nand neighbourhood, Davao, Surigao, Talisay, and several other\r\nplaces, are really quite healthy for Europeans, if they take care\r\nof themselves.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are frequent. They would sometimes be destructive, but\r\nthere is so little in the way of buildings to destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDivisions for Administrative Purposes.\r\n\r\nZamboanga is the chief military station and the residence of the\r\ncommandant-general of the island.\r\n\r\nMindanao is divided into five districts:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1st. District chief town Zamboanga (capital of the island).\r\n    2nd. District chief town Misamis (includes Lake Lanao).\r\n    3rd. District chief town Surigao (includes the whole kingdom\r\n         of Caraga, also the valley of the Agusan).\r\n    4th. District chief town Davao (shores of the bay and peninsula\r\n         of San Agustin).\r\n    5th. District chief town Cotta-bato (valley of the Rio Grande\r\n         and ancient Sultanate of Buhayen).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe island of Basilan forms a sixth district under the\r\ncommandant-general of Mindanao.\r\n\r\nEach of these districts was under a politico-military governor and\r\nother officials, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    1st District, Major, Naval Lieutenant, Captain of Port.\r\n    2nd District, Lieut.-Colonel.\r\n    3rd District, Lieut.-Colonel.\r\n    4th District, Major.\r\n    5th District, Lieut.-Colonel.\r\n    6th District, Naval Lieutenant, Naval Station.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides these politico-military governors there were the following\r\nofficers in charge of military districts:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mumungan in 2nd district (Fort Weyler and vicinity to look after\r\n    the Moros of Lake Lanao) Major.\r\n    Dapitan in 2nd district (To look after the Moros of Sindangan\r\n    Bay) Major.\r\n    Bislig in 3rd district (To look after the Mandayas and Manobos)\r\n    Captain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo attend to the administration of justice there was a third-class\r\njudge in each district. From their decisions there was an appeal to\r\nthe Audiencia at Cebu, and from there to the Supreme Court, Madrid.\r\n\r\nIn Zamboanga where there is (or was) a custom-house, there resided a\r\nTreasury delegate of the second class. In each of the other districts\r\nthere is one of the fourth class.\r\n\r\nThe southern naval division has its headquarters at Isabela de Basilan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProductions of Mindanao.\r\n\r\nThe climate and soil of Mindanao are suitable for growing almost\r\nany tropical crop to great advantage: hemp, sugar cane, tobacco,\r\ncoffee, cacao, rice, indigo, sesame, maize, sweet potatoes, pepper,\r\nall flourish. But the island is very backward; it is only recently\r\nthat the savage races have been settled in the reducciones. The\r\npopulation is very sparse, and natives are more addicted to washing\r\nthe sands for gold or seeking jungle-produce than disposed to apply\r\nthemselves to agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe exports have hitherto been very small. About some of the northern\r\nports a good beginning has been made in cultivating and preparing hemp,\r\nand several Spaniards have laid out plantations there.\r\n\r\nThere is a small export of coffee and cacao, and the circumstance\r\nthat the greater part of the island is free from typhoons renders it\r\nexceptionally favourable for planting these valuable products, or for\r\ngrowing unlimited quantities of cocoa-nut for making copra. For the\r\nsame reason the timber in Mindanao is larger than in the best districts\r\nof Luzon, and some of the trees are truly magnificent. Mindanao,\r\nwith its inhabitants busily engaged in murdering their neighbours\r\nand enslaving their children, can, of course, never prosper; but if\r\nsuch outrages are repressed, and peace assured, the population will\r\nrapidly increase and agriculture will prosper.\r\n\r\nAmongst the forest produce gutta-percha took a leading place,\r\nbut this product came through the hands of the Chinese traders,\r\nwho, as their custom is, adulterated it to such an extent that its\r\nvalue became greatly depreciated in European and American markets,\r\nand the trade fell off. Some lignite is found in Mindanao, but I have\r\nno confidence in the value of Philippine coal-fields. They have been\r\ntoo much broken up by volcanic action. I have very little doubt that\r\npetroleum will be found in Mindanao when it is explored. It has been\r\nreported in Mindoro and Cebu.\r\n\r\nThe early explorers of the Archipelago state that the natives wore\r\nlittle clothes, but abundance of gold ornaments. Now they wear more\r\nclothes but little gold. It is surprising how quickly the heathen\r\nbecome impoverished whenever they have Christian neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasilan.\r\n\r\nThe sixth district of Mindanao is formed of the Basilan group of some\r\nforty islands lying opposite to Zamboanga, having a total area of\r\n170,000 acres. The only important one of the group is Basilan Island,\r\nwhich has an irregular outline, an oval with two projections opposite\r\neach other, east and west, the latter resembles a turtle's head and\r\nthe former a turtle's tail, so that the shape of the island on the\r\nmap is that of a turtle with his head to the west. The total length\r\nfrom the point of the beak to the tip of the tail is about thirty-two\r\ngeographical miles, and the width across the body about twenty-one\r\nmiles. The port of Isabela is sheltered by the Island of Malamaui,\r\non which there is a Moro rancheria called Lucbalan, and a Christian\r\nvisita, Sta. Barbara. The capital, Isabela, is situated about the\r\ncentre of the channel, and to the east of the mouth of the Pasahan\r\n(now called Isabela) River.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the town, which is situated on a stony slope at a\r\nshort distance, the fort is placed at an elevation of about sixty\r\nfeet above the sea. It commands both entrances of the channel.\r\n\r\nThere is a barrack near the fort, a prison, military infirmary, school,\r\ntown hall. The naval station consists of store-houses and workshops,\r\nmarine-barracks, hospital, and magazine.\r\n\r\nThere is a church, and missionaries' residence. The island is hilly but\r\nfertile in places. Some twenty to thirty acres are under cultivation\r\nnear Isabela, and the Moros who form the principal population make\r\ntheir slaves work on the lands about their hamlets. There are no\r\nmanufactures worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nThe Christian population is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         Inhabitants.\r\n\r\n        Town of Isabela                       921\r\n        Hamlet of San Pedro de Guihanan       130\r\n        Hamlet of Santa Barbara                50\r\n        Reduccion of Panigayan                 25\r\n        Reduccion of Tabuc                     12\r\n        Scattered Christians                   12\r\n        Members of the Naval Station           86 variable.\r\n        Garrison of the Fort                   40    ,,\r\n                                            ------\r\n                                             1276\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moro population is distributed in about fifty villages or\r\nhamlets. They can turn out about 4400 fighting-men, and are considered\r\nvaliant and hardy.\r\n\r\nThe Moros of Basilan, according to Father Foradada, have not the\r\nsanguinary instincts of those of Lake Lanao or of Jolo, and any\r\noutrages they commit are, he thinks, due to the instigations of the\r\nMoros of Jolo, who unfortunately keep up a communication with them\r\nand corrupt them.\r\n\r\nAmongst the most influential Dattos of Basilan is Pedro Cuevas,\r\na Tagal. He was formerly a convict, but escaped, and, by force of\r\ncharacter and desperate courage, he became a leading man amongst\r\nthe Moros. Having rendered some services to Spain, he received a\r\npardon, and now has extensive plantations, a sugar-mill, and herds\r\nof cattle. He is, in fact, about the richest and most influential\r\nman in the island, and has become reconciled to the Church, and was\r\nmuch trusted both by the military and naval authorities and by the\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nThe map of the island is from a report of Father Cavalleria who went\r\nby sea right round it in 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBES OF MINDANAO.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisayas (1) [Old Christians].\r\n\r\nIn another part of the book I have given a description of the Visayas\r\nin their own islands, and have spoken of their enterprise and industry\r\nas manifested in the extent of their exports of sugar and hemp,\r\nand in their manufacture of textiles of the most varied kind.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas of Mindanao have been modified by their environment both\r\nfor good and evil. Thus they are bolder and more warlike than their\r\nbrethren at home, having had for centuries to defend themselves\r\nagainst bloodthirsty Moros. The Visayas of Caraga are especially\r\nvaliant and self-reliant, and they needed to be so, for the Spaniards,\r\nwhenever hard pressed by English, Dutch or Portuguese, had a way of\r\nrecalling their garrisons, and leaving their dependents to shift for\r\nthemselves. The Visaya of Mindanao, therefore, though not a soldier,\r\nis a fighting-man, and their towns possess a rudimentary defensive\r\norganisation called the somaten. This, I believe is a Catalan word,\r\nand indicates a body of armed townsmen called together by the church\r\nbell to defend the place against attack. This service is compulsory\r\nand unpaid.\r\n\r\nThe arms have been supplied by the Spanish Government, and have\r\ngenerally been of obsolete pattern. I have seen in Culion flint-lock\r\nmuskets in the hands of the guards. Latterly, however, Remington\r\nrifles have been supplied, and they are very serviceable and quite\r\nsuitable for these levies.\r\n\r\nThe Visayas have been the assistants of the missionaries, and from\r\nthem come most of the school-masters and mistresses who instruct the\r\nchildren of the recently-converted natives.\r\n\r\nTheir language is fast extending, and their numbers are increasing,\r\nboth naturally, and by a considerable voluntary immigration from the\r\nsouthern Visayas Islands.\r\n\r\nTo the inhabitants of these small islands, fertile Mindanao, with its\r\nbroad lands, free to all, is what the United States were a generation\r\nago to the cotters of Cork or Kerry--a land of promise.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a demoralising tendency at work amongst the\r\nVisayas. The profits of bartering with the hill-men are so great, that\r\nthey are tempted away from their agriculture, and from their looms,\r\nto take up this lucrative trade, in competition with the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe Visaya has one great advantage over the Chinaman; he has the\r\ncourage to go up into the hills, and find his customers in their\r\nhaunts. This the Celestial could not do, but has to remain at his\r\nstore on the coast and await the hill-men.\r\n\r\nBoth traders cheat the hill-tribes most abominably.\r\n\r\nDr. Montano mentions a case which happened in Butuan in December, 1879.\r\n\r\nA Visaya went into the interior taking with him some threads of\r\ndifferent colours which he had purchased for seventy-five cents, and\r\nreturned with jungle produce worth ten dollars. This he invested in\r\nbeads, brass-wire, and other articles of trade, and returned to the\r\nwoods. In a month he came back, bringing produce to the value of 100\r\ndollars, and 400 dollars to his credit with the natives.\r\n\r\nThe tribes of Mindanao pay their debts with scrupulous exactness. If\r\nthey die before paying, their sons assume the debt, and unless they\r\nare killed or taken as slaves by other races, the money is sure to\r\nbe paid. Consequently, this rapacious usurer had sold them goods\r\ncosting 10 dollars, 75 cents, for 510 dollars, of which 110 dollars\r\nin cash, and 400 dollars credit. It is satisfactory to learn that\r\nthe commandant at Butuan made him disgorge, and freed the hill-men\r\nfrom their heavy debt.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the Visaya is a necessary man in Mindanao, and the\r\nimmigration should be encouraged. All the Visaya towns bordering on\r\nthe Moros should have their somatenes armed, exercised, and supplied\r\nwith ammunition. Amongst Visayas are to be found plenty of men well\r\nsuited to command these bands. As they are fighting the Moros for\r\nlife and property, they may be trusted to stand up to them manfully.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows a party of Visayas militia belonging to the\r\ntown of Baganga, in Caraga, under a native officer of gigantic stature,\r\nLieutenant Don Prudencio Garcia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMamanuas (2).\r\n\r\nA hybrid race between Negritos and Malays.\r\n\r\nThey are not numerous, and live in the northern promontory of\r\nSurigao, from near the River Agusan to the east coast, south of Lake\r\nMainit. They are, indeed, miserable wretches, wandering in the hills\r\nand forest without any fixed habitation, their only property a lance,\r\na bolo, and some starveling curs.\r\n\r\nSometimes they plant a few sweet potatoes, and at certain times\r\nin the year they get wild honey; at other times they hunt the\r\nwild pig. They lay up no provisions, and wander about naked and\r\nhungry. They are difficult to convert, having no good qualities to\r\nwork upon. They promise anything, but never perform, being able to\r\ngive as a reason--some evil omen, for instance--that, on coming out\r\nin the morning, they have heard the cry of the turtle-dove (limbucun)\r\non the left hand.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these difficulties, the zeal of the missionaries\r\nhas not been wasted, and several reducciones of Mamanuas have been\r\nfounded, and are progressing to some extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManobos (3).\r\n\r\nThe Manobos are a warlike heathen race, widely extended in\r\nMindanao. The great River Agusan, taking its rise in the district\r\nof Davao, in 7 deg. N. latitude, falls into the Bay of Butuan about\r\n9 deg. N. latitude. Its general course is parallel to the eastern\r\nCordillera, from which it receives numerous tributaries. At almost\r\n8 deg. 15' N. latitude it expands, and forms four considerable lakes of\r\nno great depth, and varying in extent according to the season. They\r\nare partly covered by aquatic plants. These lakes are called Linao,\r\nDagun, Dinagat and Cadocun; they are quite near each other. The Manobos\r\ninhabit this spacious valley from Moncado, in 7 deg. 45', to about 8 deg. 45'\r\nN. latitude on the right bank, where they come in contact with the\r\nMamanuas and Mandayas; but on the left bank they extend nearly to the\r\nsea, and up to the eastern slopes of the Central Cordillera. They even\r\nextend over the Cordillera to the head waters of the Rio Grande. They\r\noccupy the left bank of the Pulangui, and their southern frontier on\r\nthe Rio Grande is at 7 deg. 30' N. latitude, where one of their chiefs,\r\ncalled the Datto Capitan Manobo, lives. The river is navigable for\r\nvintas up to here, and, in 1863, the gunboat Taal, drawing six feet,\r\nsteamed to within five miles of this point, say up to the River\r\nSimuni. They extend up the Pulangui to about 8 deg. 15' N. latitude. In\r\nappearance they have a Mongolian cast of feature. Their faces are\r\nlonger than amongst the Mandayas; their noses are not flattened,\r\nbut straight, and projecting, and slightly curved at the lower\r\nend. Their general aspect is robust; their stature is about 5 feet 7\r\ninches. Their usual dress consists of short drawers reaching to the\r\nknee, and a sort of singlet, or short shirt.\r\n\r\nThey live in clans under a bagani, or head-murderer (see Mandayas for\r\nexplanation), who is usually accompanied by his brothers-in-law. They\r\nare polygamists; still, the first wife is the head, and all the others\r\nmust obey her. Each wife has her own house, just as the late Brigham\r\nYoung's harem had at Salt Lake City. But they are satisfied with fewer\r\nthan that prophet, there being none amongst their dattos who have\r\nnineteen wives. They are slaveholders, as the children taken in war\r\nbecome slaves, and all the work of cultivation is done by the women,\r\nchildren and slaves.\r\n\r\nTheir houses are built on piles, as are also their granaries. They\r\ncultivate on a considerable scale, and raise quantities of rice, maize,\r\nsweet potatoes and tobacco, not only to supply their own wants, but\r\nto sell in boat-loads to the Visayas. Their arms are lances, shields,\r\nswords and daggers, and, in some parts, bows and arrows. They are\r\nsaid to be expert archers where they use the bow. They raise numbers\r\nof horses for riding.\r\n\r\nIn valour, and in disposition to come to close quarters in fighting,\r\nthey resemble the Igorrotes of Luzon. They stand up squarely to the\r\nMoros, which few other races have the pluck to do. Like the Igorrotes,\r\ntheir religion consists in ancestor-worship, but they call their\r\nidols Dinatas instead of Anitos. They are much impressed by thunder,\r\nwhich they call the voice of the lightning, and a rainbow fills them\r\nwith awe. Like the Tagals, and some races in British India, they\r\nconsider the crocodile a sacred animal, and respectfully address it as\r\ngrandfather. They also, like the old heathen Tagals, consider rocks,\r\ncaves, or balete trees, as residences of spirits. They celebrate a\r\nfeast in honour of the Dinatas after the harvest, and make sacrifices\r\nof swine.\r\n\r\nTag-Busan is their god of war, and it is usual amongst them to go on\r\nthe war-path after the harvest is secured; the bagani, as high priest\r\nof this god, carries his talisman hung round his neck.\r\n\r\nThey make ambuscades, and attack neighbours or enemies in the\r\nmost treacherous manner, either by setting fire to their houses and\r\nmurdering them as they attempt to escape from the flames, or they cut\r\nthrough the piles supporting the houses, covering themselves with their\r\nshields interlocked whilst doing so, and spearing the occupants when\r\nthe house falls. When an enemy has been felled, the bagani, taking\r\na consecrated sword, never used in fighting, cuts open the chest,\r\nand immerses the talisman of the god in the blood; then, tearing\r\nout the heart or liver, he eats a piece. The Sacopes are not allowed\r\nthis privilege, which belongs only to the chief, as the high priest\r\nof the god of war. The children of the slain are taken as slaves,\r\nand the young women for concubines. One of the prisoners is kept to\r\nbe sacrificed in some cruel manner to Tag-Busan on the return of the\r\nexpedition as a thank-offering.\r\n\r\nThe death of a relative requires to be atoned for by the murder of\r\nany innocent person passing by, the avenger concealing himself near\r\na path, and killing the first stranger who comes.\r\n\r\nThe Manobos are very smart in handling canoes or rafts on their\r\nrivers, which are very dangerous to navigate, and have many rapids and\r\nwhirlpools; the Pulangui even precipitates itself into a chasm, and\r\nruns underground for a league and a half. However, the terrible picture\r\nI have drawn of their habits is becoming year by year a thing of the\r\npast to thousands of Manobos, although still kept up in places. The\r\nintrepidity of the Jesuit missionaries is proof against every danger\r\nand every privation, has carried them up the River Agusan, on which,\r\nat short distances apart, they have established towns or villages, and\r\nhave brought many thousands of Manobos within the Christian communion.\r\n\r\nFather Urios, one of these missionaries, baptized 5200 heathen in one\r\nyear, and now no less than twenty Christian towns or villages stand\r\non the banks of the River Agusan and its tributaries, populated by\r\nperhaps fifteen thousand Manobos, formerly heathens, who have given\r\nup their detestable practices and their murderous slave-raids to\r\noccupy themselves in cultivating the soil, whilst their children of\r\nboth sexes are receiving instruction from Visaya school-masters and\r\nmistresses. There is always a tendency to remontar amongst them, and\r\nsometimes nearly all the inhabitants of a village take to the woods\r\nand hills. Yet, secure from attack, the number of converts steadily\r\nincreases. The Baganis have become gobernadorcillos, and their chief\r\nvassals tenientes, jueces de paz, and cuadrilleros. Some of the old\r\nBaganis who were well off were so anxious not to be behind the Visayas,\r\nthat they sent to Manila for hats, black cloth coats and trousers,\r\nand patent leather shoes, to wear on the great feasts of the Church,\r\nand on the occasion of the annual village festival.\r\n\r\nThis is a long way from human sacrifices to the Tag-Busan, and\r\nceremonial cannibal rites, which these men formerly practised. I look\r\non this warlike and vigorous race as capable of becoming valuable\r\ncitizens, but they will require careful handling for some years to\r\ncome. They must not be rushed, for, if alarmed by innovations, they\r\nmay take to the woods en masse, and the labour of years will have\r\nbeen wasted.\r\n\r\nI look to this tribe, when trained to use fire-arms, and stiffened\r\nwith a few Americans, to destroy the power of the pirate races--the\r\nmurderous, slave-hunting Moros, with whom it is useless to make\r\ntreaties, who cannot be converted till the power of their dattos is\r\nbroken, and who must be sternly put down by force unless the nascent\r\ncivilisation of Mindanao is to be thrown back for a century.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of June, 1892, a Bagani of the Manobos performed\r\nthe paghuaga, or human sacrifice, on a hill opposite Veruela, on the\r\nRiver Agusan. The victim was a Christian girl whom he had bought for\r\nthe purpose from some slave-raiders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandayas (4).\r\n\r\nThe Mandayas live on the Eastern Cordillera of Mindanao which\r\nruns parallel to the coast, and their territory extends from the\r\n7th to the 9th parallel. They occupy the country down to the River\r\nSalug. They are remarkable for their light colour, some having quite\r\nfair complexions. Their faces are wide, the cheek-bones being very\r\nprominent; yet their appearance is not unpleasing, for they have\r\nlarge dark eyes shaded by long eye-lashes.\r\n\r\nThey are much respected by other tribes as an ancient and aristocratic\r\nrace, and the war-like Manobos eagerly seek, by fair means or foul,\r\nto obtain Mandaya women for wives.\r\n\r\nThey usually shave off their beards, and also their eyebrows, wearing\r\ntheir hair long, tied in a knot at the back.\r\n\r\nThey are powerfully built, and of good stature. The men wear short\r\ndrawers, and on grand occasions don an embroidered jacket. Both men\r\nand women wear large ear-ornaments. The women are clad in a bodice\r\nand patadion with ornaments of shells, beads, or small bells. The\r\nmen are of a bold and warlike disposition, ready to fight against\r\nother villages of their tribe when not at war with the Manobos, the\r\nGuiangas, or the Manguangas, their neighbours. They have a language\r\nof their own which has a great affinity to the Visaya.\r\n\r\nTheir houses, four or five forming a village, are built on lofty piles\r\nthirty or forty, or even fifty feet above the ground. The floor is\r\nof thick planks and has a parapet all round pierced with loop-holes\r\nfor defence. Above this parapet the house is open all round up to\r\nthe eaves, but this space can be closed in by hanging shutters in bad\r\nweather. The construction of dwellings at such a height must involve\r\nan enormous amount of labour. Each group of houses forming a village\r\nis usually surrounded by a strong palisade of sharp-pointed posts,\r\nand further defended by pits lined with sharp stakes, which are\r\nlightly covered over with twigs and leaves.\r\n\r\nSeveral families live in one house, after the custom of the Dayaks of\r\nBorneo, to provide a garrison for defence. An ample supply of arms is\r\nkept in the house, bows and arrows, spears, swords and knives. They\r\nare liable to be attacked in the night, either by the Manobos,\r\nthe Moros, or by the sacopes of some neighbouring datto, who shoot\r\nflaming arrows covered with resin into the roof to set it on fire,\r\nor covering themselves with their shields from the arrows of the\r\ndefenders, make a determined attempt to cut down the piles so that the\r\nhouse will fall. The attacking party is most often victorious, and the\r\ndefenders, driven out by fire, or bruised and entangled amongst the\r\nfallen timbers, are easily killed, the women and children, with the\r\nother booty, being carried off by the assailants. Under this reign\r\nof terror the population is diminishing. These people not only kill\r\nfor booty, but also for the honour and glory of it. Each warrior is\r\nanxious to become a bagani, and to be allowed to wear the honourable\r\ninsignia of that rank. The dress of a bagani indicates approximately\r\nthe number of murders he has committed. A scarlet head-cloth shows\r\nthat he has killed from five to ten men; a red shirt, in addition,\r\nfrom ten to twenty, whilst a complete suit of red shows that he has\r\nmurdered more than twenty persons, and is a much-desired and very\r\nhonourable distinction, a sort of D.S.O. or K.C.B. amongst them.\r\n\r\nAll the dattos are baganis; they could hardly possess enough prestige\r\nto govern their sacopes without this title.\r\n\r\nThe Mandayas are superstitious, and much attached to their own\r\nbeliefs, and on this account it is difficult to convert them to\r\nChristianity. The devotion of the Jesuits, however, has not been in\r\nvain, and several pueblos on the east coast round about Bislig, Caraga,\r\nand Cateel-Baganga are now inhabited by Christian Mandayas, some of\r\nwhom have intermarried with the Visayas, or \"old Christians.\" These\r\nMandayas are now safe from attack. They give their attention to\r\ncultivation, and are increasing in numbers and rising in the scale\r\nof civilisation.\r\n\r\nAncestral-worship is their religion, and their Dinatas, or wooden\r\nidols, are stained red with the sap of the narra tree. They have\r\npriestesses whom they call Bailanes, and they are said to occasionally\r\nmake human sacrifices.\r\n\r\nAs amongst other tribes in Mindanao, the Limbucun, or turtle-dove,\r\nis a sacred bird, and rice and fruit is placed for its use on a small\r\nraised platform, and it is never molested.\r\n\r\nThey are organised in a strict feudal system, the headman or datto of\r\neach village is in fact the only free man of his clan. The others are\r\nSacopes--that is, followers or vassals who, as well as the datto,\r\npossess slaves. A Mandaya datto can seldom raise more than fifty\r\nspears; sometimes two or three federate, but expeditions on a large\r\nscale cannot be undertaken, for it would be impossible to feed several\r\nhundred men in their country, such is the poverty of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSometimes a small group of Mandaya dattos recognises as suzerain\r\nsome neighbouring datto of the piratical Moros, who always tries to\r\nkeep them isolated and to prevent any intercourse or trade with the\r\nChristians, unless through themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Mandayas have canoes and bamboo rafts on the streams and rivers\r\nrunning through their territory. They catch a good many fish.\r\n\r\nTheir agriculture is on a very reduced scale, and is limited to small\r\nplantations of rice and sweet potatoes near their villages; they\r\nkeep poultry. They do not dare to travel far from their houses for\r\nfear they might be seized for slaves, or even sold to be sacrificed\r\non the death of a datto. Sometimes when a man has been condemned to\r\ndeath for some crime his datto sells him to some person requiring a\r\nvictim for the death-vengeance, if he is assured that it is intended\r\nto kill him. The datto thus combines the execution of justice with\r\na due regard to his own profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManguangas (5).\r\n\r\nAccording to Blumentritt, this tribe lives in the Cordillera Sagat,\r\nand extends as far as the Great Lake Boayan or Magindanao, and an\r\nold estimate gives their number as 80,000. On his map he shows, the\r\nLake and River Boayan in dotted lines, the latter is made to fall\r\ninto the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nOn two modern maps of Mindanao which I have, one by Jesuits and the\r\nother from Don Jose Nieto Aguilar's book on this Island, neither\r\nthe river nor the lake appear; but, in their stead, a lofty range\r\nof mountains is shown. In each of these maps the Manguanga territory\r\noccupies an entirely different location.\r\n\r\nAs the Jesuits have three reducciones or villages amongst this\r\ntribe, I accept their map as constructed according to the latest\r\ninformation. They show in their earlier maps the Manguanga territory\r\nat the head of the Bay of Davao, its southern frontier being some\r\ntwelve miles from the sea, and about the head-waters of the River\r\nSalug and the River Agusan.\r\n\r\nThe reducciones are called Gandia, Pilar, and Compostela. In the\r\ngeneral Report of the Jesuit Missions of 1896, the mission station of\r\nJativa is stated to consist of six reducciones of Manobos, Mandayas\r\nand Manguangas, with a total population of 1389.\r\n\r\nIn the general report of the following year the Manguangas and other\r\ntribes are not specifically mentioned, and the total population of\r\nthe mission station of Jativa is given as 1458.\r\n\r\nIn a later ethnographical map of Mindanao the Manguanga territory\r\nappears still more circumscribed, being limited to a strip of land\r\nbetween the Rivers Julep and Nabo, affluents of the River Agusan;\r\nNieto's map, however, shows them extending over the Eastern Cordillera\r\ntowards Linguit, which is situated on the coast in about 7 deg. 50'\r\nN. latitude.\r\n\r\nDr. Montano, who went up the Rio Salug in 1880, passing through the\r\nManguanga territory, says he found the banks deserted.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this once numerous tribe has been reduced\r\nto a mere remnant, part settled in the before-mentioned reducciones,\r\nand part still wandering in mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonteses or Buquidnones (6).\r\n\r\nThe Spanish word Montes, means hill-man. Buquid, in Tagal, means\r\narable land; and Taga-buquid, a countryman. The Tagal equivalent of\r\nhill-man is Taga-bundoc, which corresponds to the jungle-wallah of\r\nBritish India. The word Buquidnones may mean cultivators, and their\r\nextensive plantations fully justify this designation. It is therefore\r\nrather a vague expression, but still designates a particular tribe\r\nin Mindanao, whose numbers were estimated to amount to 13,000 ten\r\nyears ago, and who have probably largely increased since then.\r\n\r\nThey occupy the valleys through which the Rivers of Cagayan and\r\nTagoloan run, and the hills between them and on both sides.\r\n\r\nThey hold the country of the head-waters of the Pulangui, and the right\r\nbank, as far south as the Manobos extend on the left bank, say to 7 deg.\r\n30' N. latitude. In the north they extend right up into the peninsula\r\nbetween the Bay of Macajalar and the Bay of Lunao, occupying the lofty\r\nmountains of Sabrac, Sinalagao, Quimanquil, and the sacred Balatucan,\r\nwhence the souls of the dead jump from earth to heaven.\r\n\r\nFather Clotet, from whose letters to his superiors I have taken these\r\nparticulars, considers them to be divided into three large groups.\r\n\r\nThe first consists of those living in the hills and valleys of the\r\nrivers Tagoloan, Cagayan, and Iponam; the second, of those bordering\r\non the Manobos of the Agusan between Gingoog and Nasipit, and the\r\nthird of those who live on the right bank of the Pulangui and on some\r\nof its affluents.\r\n\r\nThey bear some resemblance to their neighbours the Manobos, being of\r\ngood stature, well-built, even handsome, and are of an affable and\r\nfriendly disposition; some of them are so smart and well-bred as to\r\nbe not in the least inferior to the most civilised of the Visayas,\r\nand to judge by their free and open address, and the absence of all\r\naffectation when settling their business with the old Christians,\r\nnobody would take them for heathens.\r\n\r\nFather Urios said that, from the extent of their intelligence, they\r\nwere fit to be kings of the Manobos, so much superior were they\r\nto these.\r\n\r\nIn their dress they show a far greater idea of decorum and modesty\r\nthan any other race in Mindanao, both men and women. The latter wear a\r\nwhite shirt, which is held in at the waist by a long skirt, reaching\r\nto the ankles. Over this they wear a very short and tight jacket,\r\nto the edges of which they sew strips of cloth of many colours in a\r\npleasing tracery, the short wide sleeves being trimmed in the same way.\r\n\r\nThey show great taste in choosing the colours and designs with which\r\nthey ornament their dresses. On the left side at the waist they hang\r\nsome bead ornaments, small bells, and bunches of scented herbs. On\r\ntheir legs they wear many loose rings of brass, copper, or silver,\r\nwhich rattle when they walk. Their manner of dressing their hair\r\nis singular, and characteristic. They take the bulk of the hair,\r\nand without plaiting it they twist and knot it in a high and large\r\ncoil. All round the head fall curls cut to one length, but on the\r\nforehead there is a fringe coming down almost to the eye-brows. They\r\nsecure the coil with a handsome and showy comb, well made of metal,\r\nor precious metals, according to the means of the wearer. Many of them\r\nare loaded with bracelets from the wrists to near the elbows, either of\r\nmetal, of tortoise-shell, or mother-of-pearl. In their ears they wear\r\nlarge ornaments called balaring, made of a plug of soft wood, having\r\non each end a circular plate of brass, copper, silver, or of engraved\r\ngold, one larger than the other. The hole of the ear is greatly\r\nstretched to allow the smaller plate to pass through; the plug then\r\nremains in the hole, and is covered at each end by the plates. They\r\nwear also necklaces, sometimes of great value. These manufactures\r\nseem to be very similar to those of the Igorrotes, which have been\r\ndetailed at length in the description of that interesting people.\r\n\r\nFather Clotet mentioned a curious necklace worn by one of these women,\r\nformed of ancient silver coins, diminishing in size from the centre to\r\nthe extremities. In the middle was a silver dollar of Charles III. He\r\nconsidered this to be worth thirty dollars, which was quite a capital\r\nto a Montes in a small hamlet.\r\n\r\nEven when pressed by necessity they will not sell these ornaments, and\r\nthey consequently pass from father to son for many generations. They\r\nwear rings of brass, silver or gold, not only on their fingers,\r\nbut also on their toes.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the men on ordinary occasions is quite simple, but on\r\ngrand occasions they wear long trousers of European cloth, jackets of\r\nthe same stuff, and fine beaver hats. Their shirts of fine linen are\r\nnot worn outside the trousers as amongst the Tagals, only the front\r\nbeing shown, which is often beautifully embroidered. Those amongst\r\nthem who, although heathens, have a frequent intercourse with the\r\nChristians, have their hair cut short and take great care of it; but\r\nthose living amongst the hills let it grow long, and, rolling it into a\r\nknot, tie it up in a kerchief like the charros of Aragon. Some of them\r\npaint their teeth black, and file them into points. The wealthy men and\r\nwomen cover their teeth with thin gold plates, like the chiefs amongst\r\nthe Igorrotes, but unlike them they take them off to eat. It would\r\nseem to be indecent to show one's teeth to any person of superior rank.\r\n\r\nThey believe in a future life, and are polytheists. They worship\r\nthe gods of the cardinal points: the god of the north is called\r\nDomalongdong; he of the south, Ongli; of the east, Tagolambong;\r\nof the west, Magbabaya.\r\n\r\nThis last god, Magbabaya, which means Almighty, has, however, two other\r\ngods of equal rank: Ibabasag and Ipamahandi. The first is invoked for\r\nthe safe delivery of pregnant women; the second takes care of the\r\nhorses and cattle, and as there is hardly a Buquidnon who does not\r\npossess some of these animals to assist him in his labour, Ipamahandi\r\nis constantly called upon to help them when any accident happens.\r\n\r\nTagum-Banua, the god of the fields, is prayed to for a good harvest,\r\nand a feast called the Caliga, corresponding to our harvest festival,\r\nis held in his honour. The Tao-sa-sulup, or men of the woods,\r\ncorrespond to the Tic-Balan of the old heathen Tagals, and inhabit\r\nthe trunks of secular trees, especially the Balete, or rocky crags\r\nor caves, intervening in the affairs of mortals to favour them or\r\nupset them. Consequently they make sacrifices to these spirits to\r\npropitiate them and gain their favour.\r\n\r\nTigbas is a much respected god, looked upon with special reverence\r\nas having come down from heaven. He is represented by stone idols\r\non stone pedestals, only possessed by the principal dattos, who keep\r\nthem amongst the heir-looms of their ancestors, and only allow their\r\nnear relations or intimate friends to see them.\r\n\r\nTalian is a small idol in the figure of a monkey squatting, usually\r\nmade from the root of the willow. This they carry about with them,\r\nhanging from a cord round its neck. When on a journey, if they fear\r\nan ambush, they hold out the cord with the little idol on it like a\r\nplumb-line, and let it spin. When it comes to rest, its face is turned\r\nin the direction where the enemy is concealed. They then carefully\r\navoid that direction, if they have been following it, by turning off\r\nand taking another path. If one of them is ill, they submerge the idol\r\nin a cup of water which he immediately drinks. Otherwise, by simply\r\ntouching the suffering part, they find relief, and even a radical cure.\r\n\r\nThe Busao, an evil spirit, must be kept in good humour, and to this\r\nend they offer to it meat and drink, and sing and dance in its honour,\r\npraying to it to deliver them from any calamity they fear.\r\n\r\nThe elders are charged with the duty of offering fruits and of\r\nsacrificing the pigs and fowls to the deities. It will be seen what a\r\nstrong religious bias prevails amongst these people, who are convinced\r\nthat all the affairs of life are in the hands of Divine Providence,\r\nand of the necessity of prayer and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMarriages amongst them are arranged by the parents or by the head\r\nchief of their tribe, the Masalicampo (Maestro de Campo). A house\r\nis prepared for the young couple, and an abundant feast is made\r\nready, including an ample supply of a fermented drink called pangasi,\r\nwhich is preserved in large jars. When the guests have assembled, and\r\neverything is ready, the bride and bridegroom exchange a few words, and\r\neach receives from their respective fathers a small morsel of cooked\r\nrice. This they hold out for a short time on the palms of their hands,\r\nand then each places the morsel in the mouth of the other, and this\r\naction solemnises the marriage. The Tagbanuas have the same custom.\r\n\r\nImmediately an animated conversation bursts out amongst the guests,\r\nand a profuse and carefully-cooked feast is served.\r\n\r\nTo the feast succeeds a prolonged drinking bout, the guests sucking\r\nup the liquor through straws or canes from the jars which contain\r\nit. Amongst the Monteses it is not considered good form to return\r\nhome from a wedding ostentatiously sober.\r\n\r\nPolygamy is allowed, but little practised, only the dattos having\r\ntwo or perhaps three wives.\r\n\r\nFather Barrado, who was a missionary amongst them, remarked on the\r\nrepugnance these people have to pass through the territory of some\r\nother datto, and Dr. Montano, who crossed Mindanao from Davao to\r\nButuan, confirms this very fully as regards Mandayas and Manobos. In\r\norder that they may do this in safety, the principal dattos have a\r\nlarge and highly-ornamented lance called a quiap. In return for a\r\nsmall fee they lend this to any of their Sacopes who desire to pass\r\nthrough another datto's territory as a passport, or safe conduct. When\r\ncarrying this lance, far from being molested, travellers are treated\r\nwith consideration and deference, even in time of war.\r\n\r\nThe principal dattos show their grandeur by having enormous jars,\r\nin which they preserve their heir-looms or rare and curious objects,\r\nor use for holding provisions. Gongs also are much esteemed amongst\r\nthem. But their most precious possessions are certain wooden-boxes\r\nor trunks with copper coins nailed all over them in patterns, in\r\nwhich they keep their clothes and arms. In this they resemble the\r\nrajahs and sultans of the Malays. They use swords and lances, bolos,\r\nand sometimes the Malay kris with inscriptions and marks in Arabic,\r\nthese last are got from the Moros. Some of their arms are beautifully\r\nmade with carved handles of hard wood, and inlaid with silver,\r\nhaving sheaths of polished wood. Some of them have coats of mail,\r\nmade of brass plates and wires, ornamented with silver. These appear\r\nto be of great antiquity, and it is not known where they came from\r\noriginally. Others have quilted jackets such as Cortes found amongst\r\nthe Mexicans. Notwithstanding their amiable characteristics, they make\r\nforays like the Manobos, and attack other tribes, killing the adults,\r\nand carrying off the children as slaves and the girls as concubines.\r\n\r\nThey use the pneumatic tinder-box like the Igorrotes. They are fond\r\nof smoking, and raise large crops of excellent tobacco, selling their\r\nsurplus in Cagayan de Misamis. They prefer to smoke their tobacco\r\nin pipes, which they make themselves. They also chew buyo. On their\r\nvoyages they carry pouches to contain their belongings, and a curious\r\ncrescent-shaped box made of brass plate, which they tie on in front.\r\n\r\nAlthough able to make long journeys on foot, they usually ride, and\r\nare excellent horsemen, riding up and down the steepest paths. Their\r\nhorses are adorned with one or two necklaces of sleigh-bells, so that\r\nthey can be heard approaching from a distance.\r\n\r\nThey have no calendar, but know from the appearance of certain\r\nconstellations in the heavens, to which they give names of their own,\r\nthat the rainy season is approaching, and they then set to work busily\r\nto prepare their land for sowing or planting.\r\n\r\nThey use the plough, and make extensive plantations of maize,\r\nwhich is their principal article of food, and also of rice, they\r\nsell the surplus to the inhabitants of the coast towns, for articles\r\nthey require, especially salt. They make small stone hand-mills for\r\ngrinding maize, and what is much more curious, they have invented\r\nand manufactured cotton gins, having two wooden rollers geared\r\ntogether, worked by a crank on the upper one. These gins work with\r\ngreat regularity.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 they were much interested in planting and preparing Abaca,\r\nand Gingoog, one of their outlets, exported no less than 11,000 piculs,\r\nor the equivalent of 5500 bales in twelve months. They also take down\r\nto the coast-towns quantities of wax and resin. Their labour ought\r\nto make them wealthy, but here again we find the rascally Chinaman,\r\nwho, intoxicating them with some vile spirits, deceives them in the\r\nprice, cheats them in the weight, and sends them back sick and ill\r\nfrom their unaccustomed libations, with some wretched rubbish in\r\nexchange for their valuable produce. By this means their industry is\r\nchecked, and those who take down goods return in worse plight than\r\nthey went. Any decent Government would prohibit the demoralisation\r\nof this interesting people, but the Chinaman well understands how to\r\ndeal with the local Spanish authorities, and even subscribes largely\r\nto the church, for he likes to have two strings to his bow.\r\n\r\nThe musical instruments of the Monteses are clarinets, flutes,\r\nguitars of three strings, and a small drum.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the harvest, from the first peep of day to sunrise,\r\nbefore beginning to work, they sing or chant certain songs, the men\r\nand women taking alternate verses.\r\n\r\nThey have courts of justice to punish robbery and other offences. Their\r\nlaws are traditional, passing from father to son, and occasionally\r\naltered at the discretion of the principal datto, to whom they appeal\r\nif they have been gravely offended. The principal datto having taken\r\nhis seat, his head is bound round with the pinditon, or head-cloth,\r\nwith three points, and he takes the quiap (already mentioned) in his\r\nhand. He then invites two inferior dattos, who take seats one on each\r\nside of him. The prisoner is then led forward by a guard, who sticks\r\ntheir lances in the earth near the seats of the tribunal. The case\r\nis argued on both sides, the court deliberates and gives judgment and\r\nsentence, which is executed upon the spot, fine, corporal-punishment,\r\nor death. This is quite an ideal criminal court, and worthy of all\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nAmongst them it is considered as a want of education and good manners\r\nto mention their own names, and if a stranger asks, \"What is your\r\nname?\" the person interrogated does not answer, but some one else\r\nreplies, \"His name is so-and-so.\" This actually happened to me amongst\r\nthe Tagbanuas of Paragua, when I visited them. (See Tagbanuas.)\r\n\r\nThey believe in omens, and have many curious customs, too long to\r\nrelate, but I shall mention one.\r\n\r\nIf a stranger enters a house to visit those who inhabit it, and during\r\nthe conversation a fowl should fly and pass before him, the people of\r\nthe house instantly kill it, and cooking it as quickly as possible,\r\nthey eat it in company with the visitor to allay his fright, and cause\r\nhis soul to return to his body, for it might have left him when he\r\nwas startled.\r\n\r\nThe houses in their villages are large and well-built, sometimes the\r\nwalls are of thick planks of hard wood tied together with rattan,\r\nfor they use no nails. The houses in the country are smaller, and\r\nlow in the roof, but always so high from the ground that the longest\r\nlance will not reach the floor.\r\n\r\nGreat respect is shown to the dead. They are usually buried in their\r\nfields with lance, sword, and bolo laid beside them. They make a\r\nmound of earth over the grave, fixing several stakes like St Andrew's\r\ncrosses, and protecting the whole with the bark of a tree fastened over\r\nthe stakes. From a high post hangs a bag of rice, that the soul of the\r\ndefunct may sustain itself on the long journey to Mount Bolotucan,\r\nthe highest peak of the whole region. The soul having arrived on\r\nthis peak, gives one great jump, and reaches heaven, at a higher or\r\nlower level, according to the greater or lesser probity of its life\r\non earth. Wherever it lands, there it remains to all eternity. The\r\nrelations make great lamentations at the death, and loose their hair\r\nwhich they do not roll up for a greater or lesser period, according\r\nto the love they bore the dead.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to be able again to state that the bravery, the wisdom,\r\nand the faith and charity of the Jesuits exercised amongst this race\r\nhas had a rich reward. During the four years which concluded in 1889,\r\nno less than 6600 heathen Monteses renounced their superstitions, their\r\npolygamy, and their slave-hunting murdering raids, and, accepting\r\nthe doctrines of our Saviour, were baptized into the Christian\r\nfaith. Besides the older coast towns, mostly occupied by Visayas,\r\ntwenty-four Christian villages extend from the Bay of Macajalar far\r\ninto the Montese country, now giving the hand to the military garrisons\r\non the Rio Grande amongst those irreclaimable pirates the Moros.\r\n\r\nThe Cross was triumphing over the Crescent in Mindanao quite as much,\r\nnay, much more, by the voices of the missionaries as by the Spanish\r\nbayonets. It will be an outrage on Christianity, a blot on their\r\nrenown, if through ignorance or folly, the United States should so act\r\nas to put a stop to this holy and civilising work, and so give occasion\r\nfor some future author to write another \"Century of Dishonour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAtas or Ata-as (7).\r\n\r\nThese people occupy a considerable territory from the River Libaganon,\r\nwhich falls into the Gulf of Davao round the northern slopes of Mount\r\nApo, about the head-waters of the rivers running into Lakes Liguan\r\nand Buluan. To the north they have the Tagavauas and the Manobos;\r\nto the south the Vilanes, and on the east the Guiangas, Bagobos and\r\nCalaganes. The swampy country on the west separates them from the\r\nMoros of Lake Liguan. From the extent of their territory the Atas\r\nare probably very numerous.\r\n\r\nThey appear to be a hybrid Malayo-Negrito race, but have advanced\r\nconsiderably in social organisation. They go decently dressed, the men\r\nwearing short drawers and a shirt of Chinese pattern, and the women a\r\npatadion and an embroidered bodice--with strings of beads round the\r\nneck for ornament. They weave stuffs similar to those made by the\r\nneighbouring tribes. They are said to be of a determined character,\r\nand to stand up to the Moros in defence of their families and property.\r\n\r\nThey also attack other tribes and commit atrocious murders, not\r\nsparing women and children.\r\n\r\nA missionary passing near their territory on the River Libaganon in\r\nNovember 1892, found several households in great grief on account of\r\nunprovoked murders committed by the Atas.\r\n\r\nAs the Atas live remote from the sea-coast and have no navigable rivers\r\nrunning through their territory, the missionaries have not yet been\r\nable to make much impression on them, but they are working their way\r\nup the Davao River, and the reduction of Belen established in 1891\r\nis quite on the borders of the Atas territory. Murders, slave-raids,\r\nand human sacrifices, are still the ordinary events of Atas life.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows two determined-looking Atas warriors with spear\r\nand shield, two women and two young girls, all carefully dressed and\r\nwearing their ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuiangas (8).\r\n\r\nThe Guiangas live on the slopes of Mount Apo, to the North of the\r\nBagobos, whom they much resemble in manners and customs. In view of\r\nthe small territory they occupy, they cannot be numerous.\r\n\r\nThey have a rather effeminate air, the men wearing their hair long;\r\nbut notwithstanding this, they are quite robust, of remarkable agility,\r\nand very adroit in the use of arms.\r\n\r\nMontano gives the average height of the man as 5 feet 41/2 inches,\r\nand measured some up to 5 feet 71/2 inches. The men wear short drawers\r\nand huge ear ornaments. Their weapons are the bow and spear. They\r\nare organised on the same feudal system as the other tribes being\r\ngoverned by their dattos. Their houses, as usual, are built on high\r\npiles. They are tolerably industrious, and occasionally work for the\r\nVisayas on their plantations. They possess horses, cattle, and poultry,\r\nand make the usual plantations of rice, camote, and maize.\r\n\r\nAs regards their religion, Tighiama is the Creator, and Manama the\r\ngovernor of the world. Todlay, the god of love, is husband of the\r\nVirgin Todlibun, and the women celebrate certain rites in his honour.\r\n\r\nDewata is the protector of the house, and he is said to love blood. It\r\nis therefore incumbent on the head of every household to avenge any\r\ninsult in the blood of the offender.\r\n\r\nAs amongst other tribes, the death of a datto, or of one of his\r\nwives, requires a human sacrifice in number proportionate to the\r\nrank of the defunct. The victims are usually taken from amongst the\r\nslaves of the datto, but in some cases they are purchased by public\r\nsubscription. Being securely fastened to trees so that they cannot\r\nmove, the largest subscriber inflicts a stab--politely avoiding\r\ngiving a mortal wound, then the others follow in accordance with\r\nthe importance of their subscription. The cries of the victim, thus\r\ngradually done to death, are drowned by the vociferations of his\r\nexecutioners. These sacrifices are still carried on in the remoter\r\ndistricts, but the missionaries are beginning to convert the Guiangas\r\nnearest the coast, and have established several reducciones in Guianga\r\nterritory, such as Garellano, Oran, Guernica, Oyanguren. In the parish\r\nof Davao and its missions, there were at the end of 1896 nearly\r\n12,000 Christians, and the missionaries were actively at work and\r\nwere meeting with success. If they are re-established, and supported,\r\nin a few years' time human sacrifices will only be a dread tradition\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows a group of Guiangas, both men and women,\r\nthe latter wearing many ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBagobos (9).\r\n\r\nThis small tribe occupies the southern and eastern slopes of the\r\nApo volcano, reaching down to the coast of the Bay of Davao, between\r\nthe River Taumo on the north, and the River Digos on the south. They\r\nalso have an outlying settlement at Piapi--now called Vera--on the\r\nEnsenada de Casilaran. The lower part of their territory is swampy,\r\nand the inhabitants of this district suffer from fever and ague, and\r\npresent a sickly appearance. They resemble the Manobos in disposition\r\nand in customs, and their weapons are the same. Their dress consists of\r\nshort drawers and a jacket. The women wear a shirt and patadion. They\r\nare moderate in eating, and cleanly in their persons. Dr. Montano\r\ngreatly praises the beauty of their country, especially about the\r\nbanks of the Rio Matina.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the Bagobos is that they are horse-Indians,\r\neverybody--men, women and children--rides in their country.\r\n\r\nThey breed these horses, which are small, but endowed with remarkable\r\nendurance, and their saddles, although rude, are scientifically\r\nconstructed, like miniature McClellans. They ride with very short\r\nstirrups, and the men are always seen spear in hand when mounted. They\r\ncarefully preserve by tradition the genealogy of their horses, and\r\ngive their favourite animals a ration of 41/2 lbs. of paddy per day,\r\nas well as grass.\r\n\r\nThe basis of their food is rice and sweet potatoes, which they\r\ncultivate, using the buffalo and plough, and getting the manual labour\r\ndone by their slaves.\r\n\r\nThey plant coffee, cacao, and bananas, but having assured their\r\nsubsistence, they love to wander off into the woods to seek for\r\njungle-produce, such as wax, honey, almaciga, and the coarse cinnamon\r\nof the country, all of which finds a ready sale on the coast.\r\n\r\nThey are said to strictly perform all their engagements.\r\n\r\nThey cultivate abaca, and from the filament of this plant their women\r\nweave the tissues called dagmays, which they polish by rubbing them\r\nwith shells till they take a lustre like silk. They dye these stuffs\r\nin a primitive manner, but with satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe men are tolerable smiths, and forge their weapons from old\r\niron, which they obtain in barter. They make bits (for horses),\r\nand bracelets, and collars of brass. Amongst them gold is said to be\r\ndearer than in Paris, although the sands about Malalag, just south\r\nof their territory, yield gold.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits have made many converts amongst them, and they were, till\r\nthe Spanish-American war, under the spiritual care of the veteran\r\nmissionary, Father Urios, and his assistants. In October, 1894, 400\r\nBagobos were baptized. I am unable to give the numbers of the Bagobos,\r\neven approximately, but, from the small territory they occupy, they\r\ncannot be numerous.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows the celebrated Datto Manib, one of the principal\r\nbaganis (head-murderers) of the Bagobos, of the Apo, accompanied by\r\nhis lance-bearers, one of whom holds the quiap. Behind him are some\r\nof his wives and children, and other followers. But not even the hard\r\nheart of this blood-stained wretch could withstand the persuasion of\r\nthe Jesuits, and in 1894 he was baptized, and commenced to build the\r\ntown of Santillana for himself and followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBES OF MINDANAO--CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalaganes (10).\r\n\r\nA small tribe living on the south-eastern slopes of Mount Apo, about\r\nthe head-waters of the River Digos, which runs into the Gulf of Davao,\r\na little north of the Ensenada de Casilaran.\r\n\r\nThey are reported to be of good stature, and of a dark colour, to\r\nunderstand the language of the Vilanes, but to speak their own tongue,\r\nwhich is similar to the Manobo. They are industrious cultivators of\r\nthe soil, and store provisions for their use, never suffering from\r\nfamine, but rather assisting others less careful. Their country is\r\nvery broken, consisting of deep valleys, divided from each other by\r\nlofty crests. These valleys are full of people, so that the tribe\r\nmust be numerous.\r\n\r\nFather Urios visited them in January of 1894, and was well treated. The\r\nreducciones of Aviles and Melitta have been recently formed amongst\r\nthem, and their conversion was proceeding till the war began. Their\r\nterritory forms part of the parish and missions of Davao.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTagacaolos (11).\r\n\r\nThe Tagacaolos live in the district of Davao, on the west coast of the\r\ngulf from Malalao as far south as Lais. There are also some living on\r\nthe peninsula of San Agustin, between Cuabo and Macambol. Physically,\r\nthey are inferior to the neighbouring tribes, not so much in stature\r\nas in muscular development. They are timid, and those who are\r\nstill heathen select places for their hamlets that cannot easily\r\nbe surprised, such as rocks, or crags without forest round them,\r\nalthough this obliges them to carry water from a great distance.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of them have been converted, and settled in\r\nhamlets near the coast, but the mass of them are still heathen.\r\n\r\nTheir faces are long, the nose thin, and the extremity of it slightly\r\ncurved.\r\n\r\nThey are the victims of the Bagobos and Guiangas, who attack them for\r\nthe purpose of carrying them off into slavery. They themselves prey\r\non the Vilanes, who are less capable of defence, and make slaves of\r\nthem. They also fight amongst themselves. They make human sacrifices\r\nto their god Mandarangan, who lives in the crater of the Apo volcano,\r\nto avert his wrath, and when any noise is heard from the volcano,\r\nthey consider that he is demanding a victim.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, more than 300 Tagacaolos had been baptized, and were\r\nliving in a civilised manner in the town of Malalag, now called Las\r\nMercedes. The conversion of this tribe was being actively carried on\r\nby the assistants of the veteran missionary, Father Urios, who resided\r\nin Davao until the Spanish-American war. Las Mercedes was improving,\r\nand promised to become a town of some importance.\r\n\r\nA detachment of infantry was stationed there.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the missionaries extended beyond the reducciones, and\r\nhad some effect amongst the heathen in discouraging human sacrifices\r\nand tribal wars. It may be expected that, before long, these dreadful\r\nrites will be put an end to, if the missionaries are enabled to return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDulanganes (12).\r\n\r\nThe Dulanganes hold a territory about twenty miles square to the south\r\nof the Tirurayes, which extends from the crests of the mountains to\r\nthe coast. On the east they have the Vilanes. I have not been able\r\nto learn anything whatever about this people, nor, so far as I know,\r\nare there any reducciones in their territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTirurayes (13).\r\n\r\nThe Tirurayes occupy the hills to the south of the delta of the Rio\r\nGrande, the coast being occupied by Moros.\r\n\r\nThey are reported to be of low type, physically, and to hold the\r\nchastity of their wives and daughters as of no account.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of the Moros probably accounts for this looseness of\r\nmorals. The missionaries have been working amongst them for years,\r\nand in 1891 they had baptized 109. However, the converts were not\r\nsettled in towns, but wandered about the hills as they liked. Since\r\nthen, more of them have been baptized, and were settled in Tamontaca,\r\nand several reducciones have been founded in their territory. In\r\nTamontaca, during 1896, between heathen and Moros, there were 152\r\nconversions and baptisms during the year, besides 197 baptisms of\r\ninfants born of Christian parents. The Tagacaolos used to apply\r\nto the missionaries for everything they required--medicine for the\r\nsick, Spanish red wine for women after child-birth, or boards to make\r\ncoffins. So the missionaries not only had to bury them for nothing,\r\nbut had to find them the coffin into the bargain.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Tirurayes declined to cut timber for the\r\nchapels at their reducciones, or to haul it to place, or to do any\r\nkind of work unless paid for it. Their zeal does not lead them to do\r\nanything for the Church as a free offering. They find it very hard to\r\nbreak themselves of their nomadic customs, and are particularly apt to\r\nremontar. However, they treated the missionaries with great respect,\r\nand these could go anywhere amongst them without danger.\r\n\r\nSince the war, the missionaries have abandoned Tamontaca, and the\r\nwhole neighbourhood is in disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTagabelies (14).\r\n\r\nThe Tagabelies inhabit the hilly country between Lake Buluan and\r\nthe Gulf of Sarangani, to the west of the volcanoes Magolo and\r\nMaluturin. They are reported to be very ferocious, and have not been\r\nvisited by the missionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamales (15).\r\n\r\nThese people inhabit the islands of Samal and Talicud, in the Gulf\r\nof Davao, and are not to be confounded with the Moros Samales of\r\nTawi-tawi and Jolo.\r\n\r\nThe Samales surpass both the Moros and Nisayas in muscular development\r\nand stature.\r\n\r\nTheir feet and hands are large; they have high and projecting\r\ncheek-bones, and a stiff beard standing out round the face gives it,\r\naccording to Montano, something of a cat-like appearance. Both sexes\r\ndress like the Moros.\r\n\r\nThey are less ferocious than their neighbours, and do not, like them,\r\ngo about armed.\r\n\r\nThey do not commit any aggressions, and are industrious. In character,\r\nthey are superior to the Moros, and are not like them--cunning and\r\ndeceitful.\r\n\r\nThey have been on good terms with the Spaniards for a long time,\r\nbut until quite lately they were very obstinate, and could not be\r\npersuaded to be baptized.\r\n\r\nThey cultivate the usual crops, fish, and make salt. The women weave\r\ndagmays.\r\n\r\nThey used to have slaves, whom they purchased from the Moros or\r\nManobos, and treated them well.\r\n\r\nFormerly, they enclosed their dead in wooden coffins, made in two\r\nparts, the shallower part serving as a lid. Each piece was hollowed\r\nout of a solid log. They placed the coffins on a rude platform in a\r\ncave or niche in the rocks, or else built a thatched roof over it to\r\nkeep off the rain.\r\n\r\nThey placed near the coffin buyo and bonga for chewing, and vases\r\ncontaining rice and maize. Each year after the harvest they went to\r\nvisit the dead, and renewed the offerings.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of their former religion, but they worshipped the\r\nserpent, and believed in the immortality of the soul, and in a place\r\nof punishment by fire, which they called Quilut.\r\n\r\nThe patience and zeal of the missionaries has, however, been richly\r\nrewarded, and in June, 1894, a number of Samales were baptized,\r\nincluding most of their dattos. By the autumn of that year there was\r\nnot a heathen left in the islands, and the Samales are now settled in\r\nseven villages--San Jose, San Ramon, Alcira, Tarifa, Carmona, Cervera,\r\nand Pena Plata. This last was the residence of the missionary, who\r\nwas accompanied by a lay brother. The population at the beginning of\r\n1897 was 1625.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVilanes (16).\r\n\r\nThese people, the prey of every warlike tribe, and even of the\r\nTagacaolos, live on the summit of the mountains of Buhian, to the\r\neast and west of the lake of that name.\r\n\r\nSome of them extend as far south as the eastern shore of the Gulf of\r\nSarangani, and they people the two islands of Sarangani and Balut.\r\n\r\nThey are short and thickset, with little agility.\r\n\r\nMontano describes them as having flat, broad noses, underhung jaws,\r\nand receding foreheads, giving them an appearance of stupidity.\r\n\r\nFather Urios, however, writing about the Vilanes of Sarangani and\r\nBalut, gives a more favourable description of them. He says they\r\nare docile and industrious, and more active and intelligent than the\r\nMoros Sanguiles, who live on these same islands.\r\n\r\nHe thought them easy to convert, for they have no religious system of\r\ntheir own; but they believe in God, and in the immortality of the soul.\r\n\r\nAlthough living so near the Moros, they have not adopted any of their\r\nreligious ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Sarangani Vilanes dress like the Bagobos, and handle the lance\r\nand the bow, and are good shots in hunting game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSubanos (17).\r\n\r\nThe word Subanos means dwellers by the rivers, from suba--a river.\r\n\r\nThis numerous tribe inhabits the western peninsula of Mindanao from\r\nMisamis to Zamboanga, except the coasts which are mostly occupied by\r\nVisayas or Moros.\r\n\r\nThey are of a darker colour and inferior in physique to the Mandayas\r\nand Monteses.\r\n\r\nLike other races in Mindanao the Subanos are organised under dattos\r\nor baganis in a feudal system. It is said that he who has killed one\r\nenemy may wear a red head-cloth, whilst other tribes only concede\r\nthis distinction to a warrior who has killed five.\r\n\r\nIn religion, they are polytheists, and worship the following deities\r\namongst others:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Tagma-sa-dugat, or Lord of the Sea.\r\n        Tagma-sa-yuta, or Lord of the Earth.\r\n        Tagma-sa-manga bugund, or Lord of the Woods.\r\n        Tagma-sa-manga Suba, or Lord of the Rivers.\r\n        Tagma-sa-Saquit, or Lord Protector of the sick.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut they are said not to possess wooden idols like the Manobos,\r\nMandayas and Monteses. They raise rough altars of sticks, on which\r\nthey lay out offerings to their deities. They call these altars\r\nPaga-paga. The offerings consist of rice, chickens, eggs, buyo and\r\ntobacco, also a large jar of pangasi, a beer brewed from rice. When\r\nmaking their offerings, they sing, dance, and pray round the altar\r\nto the sound of the sucaran, a rough kind of cymbal or gong. Amongst\r\nthe Subanos only the dattos or rich men have more than one wife. The\r\nmarriage ceremonies are very elaborate, and conclude with two great\r\nfeasts or drinking bouts, one in the house of the bride's father,\r\nthe other in the house of the bridegroom. Divorce can be obtained if\r\nthe couple cannot agree, or if either quarrels with the father- or\r\nmother-in-law. It is not readily conceded, and the case is sometimes\r\nargued for days before the council of elders of the village. Children\r\nare only given names when four or five years old. The Subanos have\r\nno money in circulation, and any trading is effected by barter.\r\n\r\nThey bury their dead the day after their decease, wrapping the body\r\nin a mat. The grave is dug about a yard deep, and near the house. The\r\nBalian or priest accompanies the bearers, and sprinkles water on\r\nthe house and ground as he goes. Women do not accompany the funeral\r\nparty. The body is laid on a bed of leaves, resting on a framework of\r\nsticks or canes at the bottom of the grave. The sides are protected\r\nin the same way, and over it another framework is constructed,\r\ncarrying an earthen jar containing food and clothing. The weapons\r\nof the defunct are laid over him, and the grave is filled in with\r\nearth, great care being taken not to let a particle of it touch the\r\nbody. Sacrifices are made to the god Diuata; these constitute the\r\nfuneral feast, which is consumed in silence. When it is concluded,\r\nthe dishes and pots which contained it are turned upside down.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day another feast is held, when they talk and dance,\r\nintoxicating themselves with copious libations of pangasi. The priest\r\nthen goes through a ceremony the purport of which is to hand over the\r\nsoul of the defunct to Diuata-sa-langit, the god of heaven. He begs\r\nthe soul to go away with the god, and to trouble them no more. They\r\nthen renew the dancing and drinking, and thus conclude the period\r\nof mourning.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the Subanos are similarly constructed to those of the\r\nManobos, Monteses, and other tribes, but are not always raised so\r\nhigh from the ground, and are more roughly built. Their food is\r\nsimilar to that of the other heathen tribes. The men wear their\r\nhair long, but coiled up on the head, and covered with a kerchief\r\nworn like a turban. They dress in a tight jacket and trousers,\r\neither white, blue, or red. Sometimes they wear a sash. The men do\r\nnot wear ear-ornaments of any kind. The women wear large combs made\r\nby themselves from bamboos, but no head-covering. Their ornaments\r\nare ear-rings, strings of beads round the neck, and many bangles\r\nor bracelets of brass or silver. They are clothed in a short shirt,\r\neither of homespun or Manchester cotton, and a skirt worn tight round\r\nthe body, and reaching below the knees.\r\n\r\nThe weapons of the Subanos are the lance, which they call talanan,\r\na round shield they call taming, a scimitar they call campilan,\r\nthe Malay kris they call caliz, the machete or pes.\r\n\r\nTheir agriculture and industries are very primitive, and on a small\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThey have scarcely any other musical instrument than brass gongs\r\ncalled Agum, which are played as dance music to their two dances,\r\nthe Saldiringan and the Sinigay. In the first of these dances the men\r\nstand up in a row, opposite a row of women. All hold a palm-branch\r\nin each hand with which to beat time. They jump up and down with eyes\r\nfixed on the ground.\r\n\r\nFor the Sinigay, however, the partners touch each other's hands,\r\nbut only with the points of the fingers. The Subano, equivalent to\r\nour Mrs. Grundy, would feel shocked to see gentlemen dancing with\r\ntheir arms round their partners' waists.\r\n\r\nThe principal feast is called Birclog, and it lasts eight days. A large\r\nshed is built, the priests offer prayers to the before-mentioned gods,\r\nand sacrifice swine and poultry. The pigs are strangled by a rope\r\nheld or jerked by all the priests, and are placed on the altar one\r\nat a time. Above the carcass is placed a live cock, which they kill\r\nby wounding it through the mouth and letting it bleed to death. They\r\nalso offer tobacco, rice, and pangasi.\r\n\r\nThe offerings are taken away to be cut up and cooked. They are then\r\nserved, and the pangasi goes round, the priests being always served\r\nfirst and getting the best of everything, as seems to be the case\r\nall the world over.\r\n\r\nWhen the first lot of people have been fed, they vacate the shed,\r\nwhich is instantly filled by a fresh lot. Sometimes in one of these\r\nfeasts they consume twenty pigs and forty ten-gallon jars of the\r\nstrong rice-beer. When intoxicated, their conduct, according to Father\r\nSanchez, S.J., is apt to overstep the bounds of propriety, but in this\r\nthey are very much like more civilised people in the same condition.\r\n\r\nThe only vessels possessed by the Subanos are some canoes, or dug-outs,\r\non the rivers. These are sometimes of great length, and are called\r\nby them Sacayan. They propel them with great skill, using a long\r\ndouble-ended paddle which they use standing up, and alternately on\r\neither side. Like many other races of the Far East, they consider\r\na lunar eclipse as the precursor of great calamities, and make\r\na deafening noise to frighten away the serpent or dragon which is\r\nswallowing the moon. They consider the turtle-dove, or limocon, as an\r\nomen-bird, and will halt or perhaps return if they hear its cry when\r\nstarting on a journey. Also if they hear any one sneeze whilst going\r\ndown the ladder of the house, they return, and remain within doors.\r\n\r\nSome of the Subanos bear Moro titles, such as Timuay, which is\r\nequivalent to third class judge. Father Vilaclara, S.J., a bold and\r\nenterprising missionary, visited, in 1890, the house of a Subano\r\nnamed Audos, who had recently succeeded his father as Timuay of the\r\nSindangan River.\r\n\r\nHe counted twenty-nine persons, great and small, in the house,\r\nbut this did not include the whole family, as several were absent\r\nat their occupations. The house was built on piles, according to the\r\nuniversal custom, and the floor could not be reached from the ground\r\nby the longest lance. It measured eighteen yards long by ten yards\r\nwide, and formed one vast apartment, there being no partitions of\r\nany kind. The floor was made of strips of bamboo, and on this account\r\nit must be out of reach, for as the inhabitants sleep on grass mats\r\nlaid on the floor, they could easily be speared in the night through\r\nthe interstices of the canes.\r\n\r\nFive married couples and their children occupied this apartment,\r\neach having its own part of the floor, its own store of rice, its own\r\npigs and poultry. Each family cooked and ate independently, but all\r\nshowed the greatest respect to the aged grandparents, and consulted\r\nthem about their affairs. Father Vilaclara appears to have ultimately\r\nconverted the whole family, beginning with the boys, whom he took under\r\nhis charge, dressed and fed them, and taught them to speak Visaya.\r\n\r\nGold-washing and gold-mining is practised by the Subanos between\r\nDapitan and Misamis, where there is a vast extension of gold-bearing\r\nsand and earth. Near Pigtao auriferous iron pyrites occurs. The native\r\nname for this ore is Inga.\r\n\r\nHorses are very abundant in the district of Misamis, and in common\r\nuse for riding and as pack carriers.\r\n\r\nThe Subanos have the reputation of being war-like, yet until\r\nlately they were entirely dominated by the Moros wherever they came\r\nin contact. Since 1893 the Spaniards have isolated them from the\r\nIlanao Moros by establishing a chain of forts, and making a Trocha,\r\nor military road, across the narrow neck of land from Tucuran on the\r\nBahia Illana to Balatacan on Bahia Panquil. The width of the isthmus\r\nhere is about sixteen miles, and the forts are called Alfonso XIII,\r\nInfanta Isabel, Sta. Paz, and Sta. Eulalia, and Maria Cristina.\r\n\r\nThe Subanos appear to be much more refractory to civilisation and\r\nChristianity than the Monteses, the Manobos or the Mandayas. This no\r\ndoubt comes from the strong influence that vile nests of pirates and\r\nslave-traders around Lake Lanao has for centuries exercised over them,\r\nbut in time the Trocha, if kept as it should be, in the interests of\r\ncivilisation, will destroy that.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit missionaries were actively at work round about the Bay of\r\nDapitan in the extreme north of the Subano territory, and to some\r\nextent round about Zamboanga in the extreme south, until the war\r\nbetween Spain and America broke out.\r\n\r\nIn the Dapitan district there were at the end of 1896 nearly 15,000\r\nChristians residing in the towns and villages under the spiritual,\r\nand temporal guidance of the Jesuits. During that year 208 heathen\r\nwere baptized in the Dapitan district, but only 21 in the Zamboanga\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to assume that in the Dapitan district alone there are\r\n10,000 Christian Subanos.\r\n\r\nThe number of heathen Subanos, amongst whom there are a few\r\nsemi-Mahometans, may be about 90,000. From these figures it is quite\r\nevident that the missionary enterprise should be extended, but in\r\norder to do this the insolence of the Moros must be chastised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nThe Moros, or Mahometan Malays (18 to 23).\r\n\r\n\r\nThese terrible pirates who have for centuries laid waste the coasts\r\nof the Philippines and the adjacent islands, with fire and sword,\r\ncarrying off tens of thousands of Christians or heathen into slavery,\r\nhave only within the last few years had their power definitely broken\r\nby the naval and military forces of Spain and by the labours of the\r\nJesuit missionaries, amongst the heathen tribes of the island.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely half a century since they annually attacked the\r\nVisayas Islands and even Southern Luzon, and they have been, up to\r\nquite lately, the great obstacle to the civilisation of the Southern\r\nPhilippines. In Culion, Cuyos and other islands the churches are built\r\nwithin a stone fort, in which the population took refuge when the\r\nMoros appeared. The old Spanish sailing men-of-war could not cope with\r\nthese sea rovers, who in their light prahus, salisipanes, or vintas,\r\nkept in shallow water or amongst reefs where these vessels could not\r\nreach them. Of course, if the pirates were surprised when crossing\r\nopen water, they ran great risks, since their artillery was always very\r\ndeficient, but they sailed in great numbers, and if it fell calm they\r\nwould cluster round a solitary man-of-war and take her by boarding.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, a special force was raised in the Philippines to\r\nprotect the coasts against these pests. It was called \"La Marina\r\nSutil,\" or the Light Navy. This force consisted of large flat-bottomed\r\nlaunches propelled by oars and sails. They were half-decked forward,\r\nand carried a long brass gun, on a slide, and some swivels on the\r\nquarters. These boats were coppered and fitted with a cabin at the\r\nafter part. They carried forty or fifty men, all natives, and squadrons\r\nof them were stationed at the principal southern ports from whence they\r\npatrolled the coasts. Most of the officers were natives or mestizos;\r\nsome of them survive to this day. These vessels rendered good service,\r\nand to some extent checked the incursions of the pirates, but they\r\nhad not the speed to follow up the fast-rowing vintas of the Moros,\r\nwhich could always escape from them unless caught in narrow waters. In\r\n1824, D. Alonso Morgado was appointed Captain of the Marina Sutil,\r\nand severely chastised the Moros.\r\n\r\nSome of these rowing gun-boats are still to be seen rotting on the\r\nbeach at the southern naval stations. But the introduction of steam\r\ngun-boats in 1860 gradually did away with the Marina Sutil, and sounded\r\nthe knell of piracy in the Philippines. The Moros received terrible\r\nchastisement at the hands of these steam gun-boats, one of which,\r\nwith a crew of only forty men, has been known to destroy a whole\r\nfleet of pirates, and now their power on the sea has become only a\r\ndread tradition of the past.\r\n\r\nEven with all the advantages of steam propulsion, their suppression\r\nhas been a matter of the utmost difficulty, for the Moros are not only\r\npossessed of the greatest personal valour, but are extremely skilful in\r\ntaking advantage of every circumstance that can favour their defence.\r\n\r\nTheir towns are mostly built in the water, like the City of Brunei,\r\nthe houses having bamboo bridges to connect them with the shore,\r\nwhich can be removed when desirable. They select a site well protected\r\nby reefs or islands, or only to be approached by long and tortuous\r\nchannels through mangrove swamps enfiladed by guns cunningly concealed\r\nfrom view; a very death-trap to an attack by boats.\r\n\r\nOn rising ground and flanking their settlements they built their\r\nCottas or forts. The walls of these strongholds are a double stockade\r\nof great trunks of trees, the space between them being filled with\r\nrock, stones, or earth rammed in. Some of these walls are 24 feet\r\nthick and as much as 30 feet high, defended by brass and iron guns,\r\nand by numerous lantacas. Such places can stand a deal of battering,\r\nand are not easily taken by assault, for the Moros mount the ramparts\r\nand make a brave defence, firing grape from their guns and lantacas,\r\nand as the assailants approach, hurling their spears on them to a\r\nsurprising distance, with accurate aim, and manfully standing up to\r\nthem in the breaches.\r\n\r\nShould the assault slacken they never fail to rush out, helmet on\r\nhead, clad in coats of mail, and with sword and buckler engage the\r\nfoe in a desperate hand-to-hand struggle where quarter is neither\r\nasked nor given.\r\n\r\nThe annals of Moro-Spanish war include many well-contested combats,\r\nwhere, to use the language of Froissart, \"many heavy blows were\r\ngiven and received,\" where the most desperate exertions of Spain's\r\nbravest officers, backed up by their war-like and hardy troops, not\r\nseldom failed to carry the forts held by the indomitable and fanatic\r\nMoros. Such Homeric combats were those between that dreaded Sultan\r\nof Mindanao, Cachit Corralat and Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera,\r\nand Captain Atienzas' bold attack on the hosts of the confederated\r\nMoros of Lake Lanao. Nor were the Spanish missionaries less active\r\nthan the soldiers on the field of battle, or in the most desperate\r\nassaults. Crucifix in hand, Father San Agustin and Father Ducos\r\ncalmly walked through many a hail of bullets and many a flight of\r\nspears leading and encouraging their half-savage converts in their\r\nresistance to these cruel oppressors.\r\n\r\nNot to be out-done by either soldier or priest, Captain Malcampo, of\r\nthe Spanish Navy, drove his vessel, the Constancia, right up to the\r\nCotta of Pangalungan till her bowsprit touched the ramparts, then,\r\nsword in hand, leading a company of boarders, and using the bowsprit\r\nas a bridge, he carried the fort by assault, and put the garrison to\r\nthe sword.\r\n\r\nThe thirsty soil of Mindanao has drunk freely of Spanish blood,\r\nand Pampango, Tagal, and Visaya have all worthily borne their part\r\nin this long drawn-out crusade of the Cross against the Crescent.\r\n\r\nBut not alone the Moro sword and spear has delayed for so long the\r\nconquest of Mindanao. Deadly fevers lurk in the lowlands, the swamps\r\nand the creeks of that rich and fertile island.\r\n\r\nThe Moros appear impervious to the malaria. At all events they live\r\nand thrive in, or in close proximity to, mangrove swamp and flooded\r\njungle. The Tagal or the Visaya is not immune, and some even resist\r\nan attack of the terrible perniciosa less than a white man. I shall\r\nnever in my life forget the awful sights I witnessed in 1887 and\r\n1892 when some native regiments returned to Manila from the war in\r\nMindanao. Any one who saw Shafter's army disembark on their return\r\nfrom Cuba will understand me. Those who could march were mere walking\r\ncorpses, but the shrunken forms, the livid tint and the glassy eyes\r\nof those who could not stand (and there were hundreds of them),\r\nbrought the horrors of mismanaged war to the onlooker like one of\r\nVereschagin's realistic masterpieces.\r\n\r\nBut as the slaughter of the Dervishes at Omdurman teaches, not even the\r\nmost dauntless bravery can prevail against modern weapons in the hands\r\nof tolerably disciplined troops. The quick-firing gun, the howitzer\r\nwith shrapnell shell, the machine-gun and the magazine-rifle must\r\ninevitably bring about the subjugation of every lowland population not\r\nsupplied with these dread engines of civilisation, and only the hardy\r\ndwellers in Nature's loftiest fastnesses, the Himalayas or the Andes,\r\nmay hope to retain their independence in the future.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking instance of the irony of fate that, just as modern\r\nweapons have turned the scale in favour of the Spaniards in this\r\nlong struggle, and brought the Moros within measurable distance of\r\nsubjection, when only one more blow required to be struck, Spain's\r\nOriental Empire should suddenly vanish in the smoke of Dewey's guns,\r\nand her flag disappear for ever from battlements where (except for\r\nthe short interval of British occupation, 1762-3) it has proudly waved\r\nthrough storm and sunshine for three hundred and twenty-eight years.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, is the case, and it now falls to the United States to\r\ncomplete the task of centuries, to stretch out a protecting hand over\r\nthe Christian natives of Mindanao, and to suppress the last remains of\r\na slave-raiding system, as ruthless, as sanguinary and as devastating\r\nas the annals of the world can show.\r\n\r\nThe Moros of Mindanao are divided into five groups or tribes; Illanos,\r\nSanguiles, Lutangas, Calibuganes, and Yacanes.\r\n\r\n(18) The Moros Illanos, who are the most important and the most\r\ndangerous community, are described fully later on. They inhabit the\r\ncountry between the Bay of Iligan and Illana Bay, also round Lake\r\nLanao, the Rio Grande and Lake Liguan.\r\n\r\n(19) The Moros Sanguiles live on the south coast from the Bay of\r\nSarangani to the River Kulut.\r\n\r\n(20) The Moros Lutangas occupy the Island of Olutanga and parts of\r\nthe adjacent coasts, all round the Bay of Dumanguilas and Maligay,\r\nand the eastern coast of the Bay of Sibuguay.\r\n\r\n(21) The Moros Calibuganes occupy the western coast of the Bay of\r\nSibuguay, they are also dotted along the outer coast of the Peninsula\r\nas far as the Bay of Sindangan. They communicate by land across\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\n(22) The Moros Yacanes occupy the western part of the Island of\r\nBasilan, and the islands of the Tapul group.\r\n\r\n(23) The Moros Samales are not inhabitants of Mindanao, but occupy\r\nand dominate the Islands of Jolo, Tawi-tawi and most of the smaller\r\nislands of those groups.\r\n\r\nPhysically, the Moro is a man built for the fatigues of war, whether\r\nby sea or land.\r\n\r\nHis sinewy frame combines strength and agility, and the immense\r\ndevelopment of the thorax gives him marvellous powers of endurance\r\nat the oar or on the march.\r\n\r\nTrained to arms from his earliest youth, he excels in the management of\r\nthe lance, the buckler and the sword. These weapons are his inseparable\r\ncompanions: the typical Moro is never unarmed. He fights equally\r\nwell on foot, on horseback, in his fleet war canoe, or in the water,\r\nfor he swims like a fish and dives like a penguin.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely indifferent to bloodshed or suffering, he will take the life\r\nof a slave or a stranger merely to try the keenness of a new weapon. He\r\nwill set one of his sons, a mere boy, to kill some defenceless man,\r\nmerely to get his hand in at slaughter. [30] If for any reason he\r\nbecomes disgusted with his luck, or tired of life, he will shave\r\noff his eyebrows, dress himself entirely in red, and taking the oath\r\nbefore his Pandit, run amok in some Christian settlement, killing man,\r\nwoman and child, till he is shot down by the enraged townsmen.\r\n\r\nWanton destruction is his delight. After plundering and burning some\r\nsea-coast town in Visayas or Luzon, they would take the trouble to\r\ncut down the fruit trees, destroy the crops and everything else that\r\nthey could not carry away.\r\n\r\nYet, as they made annual raids, it would have appeared to be good\r\npolicy to leave the dwellings, the fruit trees, and the crops,\r\nin order to tempt the natives to re-occupy the town and accumulate\r\nmaterial for subsequent plundering.\r\n\r\nCommonly, very ignorant of his own religion, he is none the less\r\na fanatic in its defence, and nourishes a traditional and fervent\r\nhatred against the Christian, whether European or native.\r\n\r\nLooking upon work as a disgrace, his scheme of life is simple; it\r\nconsists in making slaves of less war-like men, to work for him,\r\nand taking their best looking girls for his concubines. His victims\r\nfor centuries, when not engaged on a piratical cruise, have been the\r\nhill-tribes of the island, the Subanos, the Tagacaolos, the Vilanes,\r\nthe Manguangas and others.\r\n\r\nOriginally immigrants from Borneo, from Celehes or Ternate, with some\r\nArab admixture, the Moros have for centuries filled their harems\r\nwith the women of the hill-tribes, and with Tagal and Visayas and\r\neven Spanish women, taken in their piratical excursions. They are\r\nnow a very mixed race, but retain all their war-like characteristics.\r\n\r\nCut off from the sea by the Spanish Naval forces, they turned\r\nwith greater energy than ever to the plundering and enslaving\r\nof their neighbours, the hill-men. These poor creatures, living\r\nin small groups, could offer but little resistance, and fell an\r\neasy prey. But now the devoted labours of the Jesuit missionaries\r\nbegan to bear fruit. They converted the hill-men, and gathered them\r\ntogether in larger communities, better able to protect themselves,\r\nand although the Moros sometimes burnt whole towns and slew all who\r\nresisted, carrying off the women and children into slavery, yet,\r\non the other hand, it often happened that, getting notice of their\r\napproach, the Jesuits assembled the fighting men of several towns,\r\nand, being provided with a few fire-arms by the Government, they fell\r\nupon the Moros and utterly routed them, driving them back to their\r\nown territory with great loss. Of late years the Moros have found\r\ntheir slave-raids involve more danger than they care to face, and\r\neven the powerful confederation of Lake Lanao was, till the Spanish\r\nAmerican war, hemmed in by chains of forts and by Christian towns.\r\n\r\nBut they have by no means entirely renounced their slave-raiding,\r\nand in order to give a specific instance of their behaviour in recent\r\nyears, I will mention that on the 31st. of December, 1893, a party\r\nof 370 of them, under the Datto Ali, son to Datto Nua, accompanied\r\nby seven other Dattos, all well armed, and forty of them carrying\r\nmuskets or rifles, and plenty of ammunition, made an unprovoked and\r\ntreacherous attack on Lepanto, a Christian village in the Montes\r\ncountry, near the confluence of the Kulaman River with the Pulangui,\r\nbetween the Locosocan and Salagalpon cataracts. This is the extreme\r\nsouthern settlement of the Jesuits, and the nearest missionary resided\r\nat Linabo, whilst the nearest garrison was at Bugcaon, some four\r\nleagues distant.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, not being provided with fire-arms, sought safety\r\nin flight, but the Moros captured fourteen of them. They profaned\r\nthe church, hacked to pieces the image of Our Saviour, and cut up\r\na painting of Our Lady of the Rosary, smashed the altar, and with\r\nthe debris, lighted a bonfire in the middle of the church, which,\r\nstrange to say, however, did not take fire.\r\n\r\nThey stole the cattle and horses, looted the village, and marched\r\noff with their spoil and the fourteen captives.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, they reached the ford on the River Mulita, five of\r\nthe Christians refused to proceed into slavery. These were the Datto\r\nMausalaya, another man named Masumbalan, and three women. They were\r\nall put to death by the Moros and barbarously mutilated. The flesh\r\nwas cut from their bones, and it is said that the Moros consumed some\r\nof it, and so terrified the other captives that they marched forward\r\ninto life-long slavery.\r\n\r\nHad the converts in Lepanto been supplied with a few fire-arms,\r\nthis disaster would not have happened.\r\n\r\nThe Mindanao Moros commonly wear a bright coloured handkerchief as a\r\nhead-cloth or turban, a split shirt of Chinese pattern, wide trousers,\r\nand gaudy sashes.\r\n\r\nThe young men shave their heads, but after marriage they let their\r\nhair grow long.\r\n\r\nThe dattos, mandarines, and pandits usually cultivate a moustache,\r\nothers pluck out all the hair on the face. The poorer women commonly\r\ndress in white and wear a jacket and a skirt coming down well below\r\nthe knee. The richer ones wear silks of the brightest colours.\r\n\r\nA white turban or head-cloth is a sign of mourning.\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows a group of Moros of the East coast. They are\r\nunarmed, unlike those of Lake Lanao.\r\n\r\nThe Moro noble takes great pride in his long descent, and in the\r\ndistinction gained in war by his ancestors. During the long hours of\r\ntheir friendly meetings called Bicharas, they relate to each other\r\ntales of their ancestors' heroism.\r\n\r\nTheir feudal system has been more or less copied by Subanos, Manobos,\r\nMonteses and other hill-races. The datto or mandarin is the feudal\r\nchief amongst all these, but the Moros have gone a step further,\r\nand have instituted rajahs and sultans, although with only a shadowy\r\nauthority; for every important matter must come before the council\r\nof dattos for approval.\r\n\r\nThey use titles similar to those of the Malays of Borneo and\r\nJohore. Tuang, the head-man of a village; Cuano, a Justice of the\r\nPeace; Lamudia, Nacuda and Timuay, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class judges;\r\nGangalia, a constable; Baguadato, a principal, or Cabeza; Maradiadina,\r\neldest son of a principal. A datto is known by the richness of his\r\napparel and by using gold buttons, and especially by always carrying\r\na handkerchief in his hand. He is usually followed by a slave carrying\r\nhis siri-box.\r\n\r\nLike the Malays, they call the heir of a rajah the Rajah-muda; the\r\nnephew of a sultan uses the epithet Paduca; the son of a sultan calls\r\nhimself Majarasin, the pure or mighty.\r\n\r\nOrang-Kaya, corresponds to a magnate; Cachil, to a prince of the\r\nblood. The war-minister of a sultan is called the Datto Realao.\r\n\r\nA principal priest is called a Sarif or sheriff; and an ordinary\r\npriest a Pandita, or learned man.\r\n\r\nThe learning of these worthies is of the most rudimentary description,\r\nand consists in being able to read the Koran in Arabic, and to recite\r\ncertain prayers which they often do not understand.\r\n\r\nThey have some wretched sheds for places of worship which they call\r\nLanga. During the fast of Sanibayang, which lasts for seven days,\r\nthey are supposed to abstain from all nourishment. However, at\r\nmidnight, when they think their god may be napping, they indulge in\r\na hurried meal on the quiet. At the end of their week of abstinence\r\nthey undergo a purification by bathing, and indemnify themselves for\r\ntheir fasts by several sumptuous banquets. They are forbidden to eat\r\nswine's flesh, or drink spirituous liquors, but they are not at all\r\nstrict in their religion, and the savoury smell of roast pork has\r\nbeen known to overcome their scruples.\r\n\r\nThey are very fond of smoking tobacco, and of chewing buyo; some\r\nindulge in opium smoking.\r\n\r\nTheir amusements are gambling, cock-fighting, and combats of\r\nbuffaloes. Their slave-girls perform various libidinous dances to\r\nthe sound of the agun, or brass gong, and the calintangang, a kind\r\nof harmonium of strips of metal struck by a small drum-stick.\r\n\r\nThe dance called the Paujalay is usually performed at a marriage of\r\nany importance, and the young dancers, clad in diaphanous garments,\r\nstrive to present their charms in the most alluring postures, for\r\nthe entertainment of the dattos and their guests.\r\n\r\nThey have also a war-dance called the Moro-moro, which is performed by\r\ntheir most skilful and agile swordsmen, buckler on arm and campilan\r\nin hand to the sound of martial music. It simulates a combat, and\r\nthe dancers spring sideways, backwards or forwards, and cut, thrust,\r\nguard, or feint with surprising dexterity.\r\n\r\nThe Moros are polygamists in general, although the influence of the\r\nChristian women taken as captives and sometimes married to their\r\ncaptors, has, in many cases, succeeded in preventing their husbands\r\nfrom taking a second wife. The cleverness and aptitude for business\r\nof Christian Visayas, and Tagal women captives, has sometimes raised\r\nthem to the highest position in rank and wealth amongst the Moros;\r\nand few of them would have returned to their former homes, even if\r\nan occasion had offered. The custom of seizing girls for slaves and\r\nconcubines which has prevailed amongst the Moros for centuries, has\r\nof course had the effect of encouraging sensuality, and the morals\r\nof Moro society may be compared to those of a rabbit-warren.\r\n\r\nThe Moros do not always treat their slaves with cruelty, they rather\r\nstrive to attach them to their new home by giving them a female\r\ncaptive or a slave-girl they have tired of, as a wife, assisting them\r\nto build a house, and making their lot as easy as is compatible with\r\ngetting some work out of them.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest allurement to one of these slaves is when\r\nhis master takes him with him on a slave-raid, and gives him the\r\nopportunity of securing some plunder, and perhaps a slave for himself.\r\n\r\nOnce let him arrive at this stage, and his master need have no fear\r\nof his absconding.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards have for years refused to send back any slaves who\r\nclaim their protection, yet it has been remarked by Dr. Montano, and\r\nby missionaries and Spanish military officers, that slaves have been\r\nemployed fishing or tilling the ground near the Spanish outposts,\r\nand only rarely would one step within the lines to obtain his liberty.\r\n\r\nIf caught running away from their masters, the dattos, they are\r\nsometimes put to death, or mutilated in a most cruel manner.\r\n\r\nThe famous Datto Utto, of the Rio Grande, is said to have stripped\r\na runaway slave naked and to have tied him to a tree, leaving him to\r\nbe stung to death by the mosquitos or devoured piecemeal by ants.\r\n\r\nThis same Datto Utto, towards the end of 1889, made himself so\r\nobjectionable to the Datto Abdul, one of his neighbours, that the\r\nlatter determined to place himself and his people under Spanish\r\nprotection. His village consisted of eighty houses and was situated\r\non the banks of Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nDatto Abdul gave proofs of engineering skill, for he constructed\r\neighty rafts of bamboos, and placing a house upon each with all its\r\nbelongings, inhabitants and cattle, he floated his whole village\r\nfifteen miles down the river and landed at Tumbao, establishing\r\nhimself under the protection of the fort.\r\n\r\nThe Datto Ayunan, who resides in the same neighbourhood, also came\r\nover to the Spaniards, and learned to understand and speak Spanish very\r\nfairly. He had at least three thousand followers, and in the fighting\r\non the Rio Grande in 1886-87 he took the field, supported the Spanish\r\nforces against the other dattos, and rendered important services.\r\n\r\nSeveral other dattos and chiefs have submitted to the Spaniards;\r\nfor instance, the Sultan of Bolinson, who has settled at Lintago,\r\nnear the barracks of Maria Christina. In the district of Davao more\r\nthan five thousand Moros are living peacefully under Spanish rule.\r\n\r\nThe famous Datto Utto, who gave so much trouble, lost followers and\r\nprestige, and now where the Moro King of Tamontaca held his court and\r\nreigned in power and splendour on the Rio Grande, a Jesuit Orphan\r\nAsylum, and Industrial School flourished [till the war caused it\r\nto be abandoned], bringing up hundreds of children of both sexes,\r\nmostly liberated slaves of the Moros, to honest handicrafts or\r\nagricultural labour.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Moros, the administration of justice is in the hands\r\nof the dattos or of their nominees. Offences are punished by death,\r\ncorporal chastisement, or by fines.\r\n\r\nHowever, the customs of the country admit of an offended person taking\r\nthe law into his own hand. Thus he who surprises his wife in the act\r\nof adultery may cut off one of her ears, shave her head, and degrade\r\nher to be the slave of his concubines.\r\n\r\nIf he catches the co-respondent he may kill him (if he can).\r\n\r\nA calumny not justified, is fined 15 dollars; a slight wound costs the\r\naggressor 5 dollars; a serious wound, 15 dollars, and the weapon that\r\ndid the mischief; a murder can be atoned by giving three to six slaves.\r\n\r\nAdultery incurs a fine of 60 dollars, and two slaves; or death,\r\nif the fine is not paid.\r\n\r\nHe who insults a datto is condemned to death, unless he can pay 15\r\ntaels of gold, but he becomes a slave for life. The datto acting as\r\njudge takes as his fee one-eighth of the fine he imposes.\r\n\r\nA slave is considered to be worth from 15 to 30 dollars according to\r\nhis or her capabilities or appearance.\r\n\r\nThe dattos impose an annual tax on all their subjects whether Moros\r\nor heathen. It is called the Pagdatto, and consists of a piece of\r\ncloth called a Jabol, a bolo, and twenty gantas of paddy (equal to 10\r\ngantas of rice) from each married couple. A ganta equals two-thirds\r\nof a gallon, so that the tax in rice would only be 6.6 gallons,\r\na little over 3/4 bushel.\r\n\r\nTheir language is a degraded Arabic with words from Malay, Chinese,\r\nVisaya, Tagal, and some idioms of the hill-tribes.\r\n\r\nVery few of them can read or write.\r\n\r\nTheir year is divided into 13 lunar months, and the days of the week\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                Monday.     Sapto.\r\n                Tuesday.    Ahat.\r\n                Wednesday.  Isnin.\r\n                Thursday.   Sarasa.\r\n                Friday.     Araboja.\r\n                Saturday.   Cammis.\r\n                Sunday.     Diammat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir era is the Hejira, like other Mahometans.\r\n\r\nTheir marriage customs are peculiar. When one of them takes a fancy\r\nto a damsel, he sends his friend, of the highest rank, to the house of\r\nthe girl's father, to solicit her hand. The father consults the girl,\r\nand if she is favourable he makes answer that the young man may come\r\nfor her. The would-be bridegroom then proceeds to the mosque and calls\r\nthe Imam, who goes through a form of prayers with him, after which they\r\nproceed in company to the maiden's house, followed by a slave bearing\r\npresents, and from the street call out for leave to enter. The father\r\nappears at a window and invites them in, but when about to enter, the\r\nmale relations of the damsel simulate an attack on the visitor, which\r\nhe beats off, and throws them the presents he has brought with him.\r\n\r\nHe then enters with the Imam and finds the lady of his desires\r\nreclining upon cushions, and presents his respects to her. The priest\r\nthen causes her to rise and, taking hold of her head he twirls her\r\nround twice to the right, then taking the hand of the man he places\r\nit on the forehead of the girl, who immediately covers her face. The\r\npriest then retires, leaving them alone. The bridegroom attempts\r\nto kiss and embrace the bride, who defends herself with tooth and\r\nnail. She shrieks and runs, and the bridegroom chases her round and\r\nround the room.\r\n\r\nPresently the father appears, and assures the bridegroom that he\r\nmay take for granted the virginity of his daughter. The bridegroom\r\nthen leaves the house to make preparations for the wedding-feast,\r\nwhich begins that night, and finishes on the third night, when the\r\nbride takes off all the garments she has worn as a maid and dresses in\r\nhandsome robes provided by the bridegroom. At the end of the feast, the\r\nemissary who first solicited her hand for his friend conducts her to\r\nthe house of the bridegroom, accompanied by the guests singing verses\r\nallusive to the occasion, and cracking jokes more or less indecent.\r\n\r\nContrary to the custom in other countries, it is easier to get\r\ndivorced than to get married, for this is the privilege of the man,\r\nwho can repudiate his wife at any time.\r\n\r\nThey celebrate the baptism of their children, and the circumcision of\r\ntheir boys, with feasts and entertainments. They fire off cannon and\r\nlantacas on the death of a datto, and with all sorts of instruments\r\nmake a hideous discord in front of the house of death.\r\n\r\nProfessional wailers are employed, and the pandits go through many\r\ndays of long-winded prayer, for which they receive most ample fees.\r\n\r\nThey have regular cemeteries, and, after the burial, place on the\r\ngrave the head of a cock with a hot cinder on the top of it. I am\r\nquite unable to explain what meaning is attached to this custom, but\r\nthey are soaked in all sorts of superstitions, and thoroughly believe\r\nin amulets or talismen, as do the Tagals in their Anting-Anting.\r\n\r\nOwing to the multitude of slaves they possess, they make considerable\r\nplantations of rice, maize, coffee, and cacao. They sell the surplus\r\nof this produce to Chinamen or Visayas settled in the coast towns, as\r\nalso wax, gum, resin, jungle-produce, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl\r\nshell, balate and cinnamon. It is estimated that they sell produce to\r\nthe value of a million dollars a year. They also employ their slaves\r\nin washing the sands for gold, and, according to Nieto, in mining\r\nfor silver and other metal.\r\n\r\nI have not seen this latter statement confirmed by any other author.\r\n\r\nTheir industries are the forging of swords, cris, and lance-heads,\r\ncasting and boring their lantacas.\r\n\r\nTo bore these long guns they sink them in a pit, ramming in the\r\nearth so as to keep the piece in a truly vertical position. They\r\nthen bore by hand, two or four men walking round and turning the bit\r\nwith cross-bars. Some of these lantacas are worthy to be considered\r\nperfect works of art, and are highly decorated. I have seen several\r\ndouble-barrelled. (See Illustration.)\r\n\r\nThe Moro women employ their slaves in spinning and weaving. They make\r\nexcellent stuffs of cotton and of abaca, dyeing them various colours\r\nwith extracts of the woods grown in the country.\r\n\r\nTheir houses are large and spacious, and they live in a patriarchal\r\nmanner, master and mistress, concubines, children, and slaves with\r\ntheir children, all jumbled together. They possess plenty of horses,\r\ncattle, buffaloes, goats and poultry.\r\n\r\nThey use Spanish or Mexican silver coins, but most of their\r\ntransactions are by barter.\r\n\r\nTo wind up this description of the Moros of Mindanao, it must be\r\nsaid of them that they are always ready to fight for the liberty of\r\nenslaving other people, and that nothing but force can restrain them\r\nfrom doing so. That they will not work themselves, and that as long\r\nas their sultans, dattos, and pandits have a hold on them, they will\r\nkeep no engagements, respect no treaties, and continue to be in the\r\nfuture, as they have always been in the past, a terror and a curse\r\nto all their neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE IN MINDANAO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTagabauas (24).\r\n\r\nThese people live in the very centre of Mindanao on the high peaks of\r\nthe cordillera. If a straight line be drawn on the map from Nasipit,\r\non the Bay of Butuan, to Glan, on the Gulf of Sarangani, it will\r\nintersect their habitat which may extend from about 7 deg. 30' to 8 deg.\r\nN. lat. I can learn nothing about their manners and customs. They\r\nare reputed to be ferocious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in Mindanao.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in Mindanao are almost entirely settled in the coast\r\ntowns, and are occupied in trade. They do not engage in agriculture,\r\nbut keep stores and sell to the civilised natives and to the hill-men.\r\n\r\nThey understand that they need protection, and are equally ready to\r\nmake a present to the judge, to subscribe for a gilded altar for the\r\nchurch, or to render service to the governor, in order to be on good\r\nterms with the court, the priest, and the military.\r\n\r\nVery few Chinese women come over, therefore the men have native\r\nwives or concubines, and are begetting Chinese half-castes on an\r\nextensive scale.\r\n\r\nThey are not averse to a little slave-dealing, and will casually buy\r\na boy or girl from slave-hunters, or will order such a slave as they\r\nrequire from the slave-hunters, who then proceed to execute the order,\r\nwhich probably involves the sacrifice of several lives.\r\n\r\nThus they will order a smart boy, or a pretty girl, of fifteen or\r\nsixteen, and so forth.\r\n\r\nFather Barrado, writing from Cotta-Bato, June 3rd, 1890, relates\r\nthat a boy of eight years of age was purchased by a Chinaman for\r\nthirty dollars.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his master had brought him to the house, he fastened the\r\ndoor, and being assisted by four other Chinamen, tied the boy's hands\r\nand feet, and gagged him.\r\n\r\nThe four assistants then laid him out at full length on the ground,\r\nface downwards, and held him firmly, whilst his master took a red-hot\r\nmarking-iron from the fire, and branded him on both thighs, just as\r\nif he was marking a horse or a cow.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the boy escaped from the house, and found refuge with Father\r\nBarrado, who took charge of him, and administered a severe reprimand\r\nto the brutal Chinaman.\r\n\r\nThe Chinamen abominably cheat all those who are unable to protect\r\nthemselves. Their business is based upon false weights and measures,\r\nand on adulteration. In the end, they spoil every business they enter\r\nupon, just as they have done the tea trade in their own country,\r\nand the tobacco and indigo trade in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThey require to be closely looked after, and should be made to pay\r\nspecial taxes, which they can well afford.\r\n\r\nSome of the Chinese become converts, not that their mean and sordid\r\nsouls are in any degree susceptible to the influence of the Christian\r\nreligion, but in order to obtain material advantages.\r\n\r\nThey hope to be favoured in business, and to be able to get a Christian\r\nwife, which otherwise might not be easy; for although a Visayas woman\r\ndoes not disdain a Chinaman, she would not care to marry a heathen.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the Chinaman most likely remains a heathen at heart,\r\nand if he returns to China he becomes a renegade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL CONDITION OF MINDANAO, 1899.\r\n\r\n    Relapse into savagery--Moros the great danger--Visayas\r\n    the mainstay--Confederation of Lake Lanao--Recall of\r\n    the Missionaries--Murder and pillage in Davao--Eastern\r\n    Mindanao--Western Mindanao--The three courses--Orphanage\r\n    of Tamontaca--Fugitive slaves--Polygamy an impediment to\r\n    conversion--Labours of the Jesuits--American Roman Catholics\r\n    should send them help.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the island is most lamentable. Nothing could\r\nbe more dreadful; robbery, outrage and murder are rampant. Every evil\r\npassion is let loose, and the labour of years has been lost. Mindanao,\r\nwhich promised so well, has relapsed into savagery, as the direct\r\nconsequence of the Spanish-American war, and the cession of the\r\nArchipelago to the United States.\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that Spain, far from drawing any profit from\r\nMindanao, has, on the contrary, expended annually considerable sums,\r\nderived from the revenues of Luzon and Visayas, in maintaining a\r\nsquadron of gunboats to police the seas, and keep down piracy, in\r\nbuilding and garrisoning forts to suppress the slave-trade, and in\r\nassisting the missionaries to attract the heathen, by providing them\r\nwith seeds, implements of husbandry, and with clothing, also in giving\r\nthem fire-arms and ammunition to protect themselves from the Moros.\r\n\r\nAnnuities were paid to friendly Moro dattos as rewards for services\r\nrendered, or as compensation for the cession of some of their rights.\r\n\r\nThe Moros have always been the great danger to the peace of the island,\r\nas the Visayas have always been the mainstay of Spanish authority.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the war with America, the Moros would have been,\r\nby this time, completely subdued.\r\n\r\nEven as it was, half the island was practically free from danger\r\nfrom them. If you draw a line on the map from Cagayan de Misamis to\r\nthe head of the Bay of Sarangani, it will roughly divide the island\r\ninto halves. The Moros who lived to the eastward of this line were\r\npacific, and some thousands of them had been baptized, and had given\r\nup polygamy and slave-trading.\r\n\r\nHad they risen in arms--which was not at all likely--they could have\r\nbeen put down by the Visayas militia under the local authorities.\r\n\r\nTo the west of this line, until quite lately, the Spanish garrisons\r\ndotted along the banks of the Rio Grande from Polloc and Cotta-bato to\r\nPiquit and Pinto, dominated the Moro dattos of that region, and nearly\r\njoined hands with the forts and garrisons on the rivers running into\r\nthe Bay of Macajalar.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining seat of the Moro power was the country around Lake\r\nLanao, where the dattos had formed the Illana confederation to resist\r\nthe advances of the Christians.\r\n\r\nThis lake has never been surveyed, and no two maps agree on its size,\r\nshape or position. It is, however, known to be very different from\r\nthe other large lakes in Mindanao, which are shallow, whilst this,\r\non the contrary, is deep; in some places, three or four fathoms will\r\nbe found close in shore. At Lugud and Tugana the banks are steep.\r\n\r\nThere are five or six islands in it; the largest is called Nuza. It\r\nis high and flat-topped, situated near the middle of the lake, and\r\non it are five hundred houses.\r\n\r\nThe length of the lake may be about 14 miles, and its greatest breadth\r\nabout the same.\r\n\r\nThere is a road all round it, reported to be in good condition for\r\nvehicles, except at Taraca, where the ground is soft. This road may be\r\nabout fifty miles long, and is said to have houses on both sides of it\r\nnearly all the way. The accompanying sketch, from D. Jose Nietos' map,\r\nshows forty-three towns clustered round the lake, but in reality it is\r\nonly one vast town, and the names are those of districts or parishes,\r\neach under the rule of a datto. The Sultan lives at Taraca.\r\n\r\nThe land about the lake is very fertile, and is cultivated by the\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nThe produce is of excellent quality, and the Moros not only supply\r\nthemselves, but export annually about 1000 tons of rice, and 900 tons\r\nof coffee.\r\n\r\nThe River Agus, which drains the lake, is not navigable.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has a great body of water, the impetuosity of the current,\r\nrushing amongst rocks, forms dangerous rapids.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the lake must be considerably above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe approaches to the northern end of the lake on both sides of the\r\nriver were defended by many cottas, or forts. Most of those were\r\ntaken and destroyed by the Spanish forces in 1894-96, but they are\r\nnow probably being rebuilt.\r\n\r\nHalf-way between the lake and the Bay of Iligan stands Fort Weyler,\r\nwhich had a strong garrison of infantry, cavalry, artillery and\r\nengineers, and was impregnable to any Moro attack. To the south of\r\nthe lake, on the shores of Illana Bay, stand Forts Corcuera and Baras,\r\nwhilst to the westward, between Illana Bay and Panguil Bay, lie four\r\nforts across the narrow isthmus called Alfonso XIII., Infanta Isabel,\r\nSantas Paz, and Eulalia and Maria Cristina.\r\n\r\nThese, with the trocha, or military road of Tucuran, cut off the\r\nIllano Moros from communication with their brethren of Sibuguey,\r\nor with their former victims, the Subanos.\r\n\r\nFurther to the northward, Fort Almonte kept watch over the quondam\r\npirates of the Liangan River.\r\n\r\nThese forts and posts were garrisoned by nearly 3000 regular troops,\r\nall natives, except the artillery (see List of Posts in Mindanao,\r\np. 386), and in addition a field force of several thousand men,\r\nalso of the regular army, was encamped at Ulama, Pantar, and other\r\nplaces to the north of the lake, and three small steam-vessels had\r\nbeen transported overland in sections, and launched upon the lake.\r\n\r\nThus everything was ready for the final blow, for the Moros were\r\ncompletely hemmed in by Spanish garrisons or Jesuit reducciones;\r\nbut the breaking out of the Tagal insurrection, in 1896, obliged\r\nGeneral Blanco to withdraw, not only the field army, but to reduce\r\nthe garrisons in order to hold Manila and Cavite until the Peninsular\r\ntroops could arrive.\r\n\r\nLater on, the war between the United States and Spain, and the\r\nimmediate destruction of the Spanish naval forces by the American\r\nsquadron, caused the Spanish authorities to sink the flotilla in\r\nthe lake, to abandon all the posts on the north coast of Mindanao,\r\nthe trocha of Tucuran, and all the forts on the Rio Grande,\r\nand to concentrate their whole force at Zamboanga, leaving the\r\nrecently-converted heathen and the missionaries to defend themselves\r\nagainst the Moros as best they could.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries of the district of Cotta-bato have taken refuge in\r\nZamboanga, fearing to fall into the hands of the Moros, who would exact\r\na heavy ransom for their delivery. As for the hundreds of liberated\r\nslave children, both girls and boys, who were gathered together under\r\nthe protection of the missionaries at the asylum of Tamontaca, they\r\nare doubtless once more in the hands of the cruel Moros of Lake Lanao;\r\nsome, perhaps, have been sold by these wretches to the heathen tribes\r\nfor twenty or thirty dollars each, to be offered up as sacrifices to\r\nTag-busan, the god of war of the Manobos, or to Dewata, the sanguinary\r\nhouse-god of the Guiangas.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries of the north of Mindanao were recalled by the Father\r\nSuperior to Manila; but in some of the towns the native converts\r\nand Visayas have detained them by force, and keep a watch on them to\r\nprevent their escape. They treat them well, and allow them to exercise\r\ntheir ministry.\r\n\r\nAs there are no Moros in that part of the island, the missionaries\r\nare not in danger, for they are much beloved by their converts,\r\nwhose only desire is to keep them amongst them.\r\n\r\nThe district of Davao has been, like other localities, the scene of\r\nmurder and pillage since the withdrawal of the Spanish authorities. At\r\nmidnight of February 6th, the bad characters and outlaws of the chief\r\ntown, under the leadership of Domingo Fernandez, a native of Zamboanga,\r\nand formerly interpreter and writer in the office of the Governor\r\nof Davao, rose in arms, and attacked the house of Don Bonifacio\r\nQuidato, sub-lieutenant of the local militia. They cut his throat,\r\nand bayoneted his wife as she lay in her bed. They then attacked all\r\nthe well-to-do people of the place, committing many barbarous acts,\r\nand plundering their houses.\r\n\r\nMost of the Spanish residents escaped from the town in a lorcha, and,\r\nafter a terrible voyage of sixteen days, suffering from hunger, and\r\nundergoing many severe privations, arrived in Zamboanga more dead\r\nthan alive. The veteran missionary, Father Urios, and three other\r\nSpaniards, could not escape, and remained in the power of the bandits.\r\n\r\nThis is only one instance of what is going on all over the island. In\r\nthe words of one who knows the country well, Mindanao has become a\r\nseething hell, and is in a condition more dreadful than ever before\r\nin historic times.\r\n\r\nBut amongst these various tribes, Christian or heathen, there is said\r\nto be one subject, and one only, upon which they all agree. They have\r\ncombined to resist by force the American invasion. If it is attempted\r\nto conquer them by force of arms, it will be a difficult, a tedious,\r\nand a costly operation--a campaign far more sickly than that now\r\nproceeding in the arable lands around Manila, where the ground is hard,\r\nthe country very level, and where field-guns can be taken anywhere\r\nduring the dry season. It is my belief that, if skilfully handled,\r\nhalf the island--the eastern half--could be pacified without war,\r\nalthough, no doubt, gangs of bandits would have to be destroyed;\r\nbut this could be done by the Visayas and the converts, organised as\r\na militia, and paid whilst on active service.\r\n\r\nBut this pacification requires the assistance of the missionaries. They\r\nare not likely to give that assistance unless terms are made with them,\r\nand one of those terms will surely be that they shall be allowed to\r\ncontinue their beneficent work unhindered and unvexed.\r\n\r\nSo the United States Government is confronted with a dilemma. Either\r\nthey must shoot down the new Christians, to introduce and enforce\r\nfreedom of worship which the converts do not want, and cannot\r\nunderstand, or they must negotiate with the Jesuits for them to use\r\ntheir influence to pacify the island, and thus subject themselves\r\nto the abuse and the outcry such a proceeding will bring upon them\r\nfrom the divines and missionaries of Protestant sects, and from their\r\npolitical opponents.\r\n\r\nAs for the western half of the island, a part may be pacified with the\r\nhelp of the missionaries, but military operations on a considerable\r\nscale will be required there sooner or later against the Moros of\r\nLake Lanao.\r\n\r\nThis would be a holy war, a war of humanity, and I would say to\r\nthe Americans: Look back on the deeds of your forefathers, on the\r\ndays when your infant navy covered itself with imperishable glory,\r\nwhen it curbed the insolence of the Bashaw of Tripoli, the Bey of\r\nTunis, and the Dey of Algiers, teaching all Europe how to deal with\r\nMediterranean pirates. Inspire yourselves with the Spirit of Decatur\r\nand his hero-comrades whose gallant deeds at Tripoli earned Nelson's\r\npraise as being \"the most bold and daring act of the age,\" and do not\r\nhesitate to break up this last community of ex-pirates and murderous\r\nslave-hunters.\r\n\r\nThe Moros of Lake Lanao could be simultaneously attacked from north and\r\nsouth. In 1894, the Spaniards attacked by the north, and transported\r\nall their artillery and stores and their small steamers built in\r\nsections, by paths on the eastern side of the River Agus. Some of\r\nthe Moros remained neutral in that campaign. Such were the Dattos of\r\nLumbayangin and Guimba. Their cottas were spared. The distance in a\r\nstraight line from the mouth of the Agus near Iligan to the lake is\r\nfifteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe path winds a good deal, and the country is hilly, wooded on the\r\nheights, and intersected by streams. There is a path on the west\r\nbank of the Agus, the country there is more open, and a large part\r\nof it is under cultivation. A good outfit of mountain-guns would be\r\nrequired on this northern expedition.\r\n\r\nThe other attack could be made from the south, the forces landing at\r\nFort Baras, or at Lalabuan. From either of these places there is what\r\nin the Philippines is called a road to Ganasi at the southern end of\r\nthe lake. The distance in a straight line is about twenty miles. The\r\ntwo roads join at about half way, just before coming to the cotta of\r\nKurandangan in the Sultanate of Pualas.\r\n\r\nThis road is reported to have no steep gradients, no boggy parts,\r\nand no unfordable streams. The country is fairly open, as there is\r\nno thick forest, but only scrub and cogon, or elephant grass. From\r\na description given by a Tagal who traversed this road, it appears\r\nto be practicable for field artillery. The combined attack, north and\r\nsouth, could be supported by an advance from the eastward of irregular\r\nforces of the Monteses from the reducciones of the Tagoloan, Sawaga\r\nand Malupati Rivers, if they were supplied with arms and ammunition\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that we have here the usual three courses; the fourth,\r\nto do nothing, and allow Moro and Christian to fight it out, would\r\nbe unworthy of the United States, or of any civilized government.\r\n\r\n1. Put a stop to slave-hunting and murdering by a military expedition\r\nagainst the Moro Dattos.\r\n\r\n2. Maintain garrisons to keep the peace and protect the missionaries\r\nand their converts and trust to their efforts to gradually convert\r\nthe Moros.\r\n\r\n3. Arm all the Christian towns round about the Moros and organise\r\nthe men as local militia, so that they can protect themselves against\r\nMoro aggression.\r\n\r\nAll these courses are expensive, the second less expensive than the\r\nfirst, the third less expensive than the second.\r\n\r\nHowever, if either the second or third course is adopted, it is very\r\nprobable that before long the first course would become imperative,\r\nfor the Moros are faithless and treacherous in the extreme, and no\r\ntreaty unsupported by bayonets has the least chance of being respected.\r\n\r\nTo adopt the second or third course, then, only amounts to putting\r\noff the evil day.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries can be of the greatest service in pacifiying the Moros\r\nwhenever the power of the dattos is broken and when slavery can be put\r\nan end to. The object of the expedition I have spoken of should not be\r\nto exterminate the Moros, but merely to break the power of the dattos\r\nand pandits, and to free their followers and slaves from their yoke.\r\n\r\nIt is generally taken for granted that a Moro cannot be converted,\r\nbut this is not the case in Mindanao. Father Jaoquin Sancho, S.J.,\r\ninforms me that when the political power of the dattos has been\r\ndestroyed, their followers have been found ready to listen to the\r\nteachings of the missionaries and beginning by sending their children\r\nto school, then perhaps sanctioning the marriage of their daughters\r\nwith Christians, they have finally cast in their lot with the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, not in scores, nor hundreds, but by thousands. He says\r\nthat his colleagues baptized in one year after 1892, in the district\r\nof Davao alone, more than three thousand Mahometan Moros. He adds that\r\ntheir religious receptivity is much greater than that of the heathen\r\ntribes, that once baptized they remain fervent Christians, whilst\r\nthe Mandayas, Manobos, Monteses and other heathen are only too apt,\r\nwith or without reason, to slip away to the forests and mountains and\r\nresume their nomadic life, their heathen orgies, and human sacrifices.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the success of the missionaries on the\r\nRio Grande and of their industrial and agricultural orphanage at\r\nTamontacca, where they were bringing up hundreds of children of both\r\nsexes, mostly liberated slaves of the Moros, to be useful members\r\nof society. This noble institution occupied the very spot where the\r\nformer Moro Sultan of Tamontacca held his court.\r\n\r\nTwo or three more institutions like this, established at points a few\r\nmiles distant from Lake Lanao, and protected from aggression on the\r\npart of the Moro, would gradually undermine the power of the Dattos\r\nby affording an asylum to all fugitive slaves attempting to escape\r\nfrom cruelties of their masters.\r\n\r\nFor years past the Spaniards have protected all slaves who have fled\r\nto them from their masters. The Datto Utto applied to General Weyler\r\nto restore to him forty-eight slaves who had taken refuge at a Spanish\r\nfort on the Rio Grande, but Weyler refused, reminding the datto that\r\nhe had signed an engagement to keep no slaves, but only free labourers,\r\nwho had the right to fix their residence where they pleased.\r\n\r\nI assume that no slaves who seek the shelter of the Stars and Stripes\r\nwill ever be sent back again into bondage.\r\n\r\nAs a guide to the strength of the expedition which will sooner or\r\nlater have to be sent against the Moros of Lake Lanao, I may say that\r\nthe total war strength of the Moros of Mindanao was estimated in 1894\r\nat 19,000 fighting-men, 35 guns, 1896 Lantacas and 2167 muskets or\r\nrifles. (See list, p. 387).\r\n\r\nThey have probably since then obtained a large supply of rifles and\r\nammunition. This traffic in arms should be at once stopped.\r\n\r\nSwords and spears they have in abundance.\r\n\r\nBut of these 19,000 men many have submitted to the Spanish rule,\r\nor have become allies of the Spaniards, like the Datto Ayunan, the\r\nDatto Abdul, the Sultan of Bolinson and many others.\r\n\r\nProbably 10,000 men would be the very utmost that the Moros of Lake\r\nLanao could bring on the field, and only a part of these would have\r\nfire-arms, which they could have little skill in handling.\r\n\r\nThey would on no account give battle in the open, but would fight\r\nin the bush, and desperately defend their cottas. They would not\r\nconcentrate their forces, for want of transport for their food supply;\r\nbesides, the nature of the country would prevent this.\r\n\r\nThey could not stop a flotilla from being launched on the lake and\r\nfrom capturing the islands as a base of operations.\r\n\r\nThe flotilla would be operating on inside lines of communication. It\r\ncould threaten one side of the lake, and in less than two hours be\r\nlanding troops on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nIn fact, with a moderate force, their subjugation would not be so\r\ndifficult as has often been supposed.\r\n\r\nIt should be made clear to the Sacopes and to the slaves that\r\nthe war is waged against the Sultans and Dattos, that the people\r\nwould have their lives and property and the free exercise of their\r\nreligion guaranteed to them, and that the adults should be exempt\r\nfrom taxation and conscription for the rest of their lives or for\r\na term of years. Then the resistance would soon slacken, and the\r\nsultans and dattos might be captured. Those who would not conform to\r\nthe new condition of things might be allowed to emigrate to Borneo or\r\nelsewhere, but their subjects and slaves should by no means be allowed\r\nto go with them, for they will soon become useful agriculturists and\r\ngood Christians, and Mindanao cannot spare them.\r\n\r\nThe question of slavery, more especially of slave-concubines,\r\nwill require delicate handling, but by adopting a conciliatory but\r\nfirm policy, this curse may gradually be got rid of without causing\r\ndisturbance or bloodshed. Cranks and faddists should not be allowed\r\nto handle this question, but it should be placed in the hands of some\r\none well versed in human nature, and a true friend of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe wise policy of the British authorities in Zanzibar and Pemba is\r\nwell worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\nAs happens in Africa, the greatest impediment to the conversion of\r\nthe heathen polygamist is the obligation to renounce all his wives\r\nbut one. This is a sore trial, more especially when they have paid\r\na good price for them, or if they are good cooks.\r\n\r\nFather Urios having persuaded a Manobo, who wished to be baptized,\r\nto do this, the man said to him: \"Of my two wives I have decided to\r\nkeep the elder, but I make a great sacrifice in separating from the\r\nother, for I had so much trouble to obtain her. Her father would only\r\ngive her to me in exchange for fifteen slaves. As I did not possess\r\nthem, I was obliged to take the field against the timid tribes in an\r\nunknown country, and to capture these fifteen slaves. I was obliged\r\nto fight often, and to kill more than thirty men.\"\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents a scene from the labours of Father Gisbert\r\namongst the Bagobos. He is exhorting a blood-stained old datto and\r\nhis wives and followers to abandon their human sacrifices, exhibiting\r\nto them the image of the crucified Redeemer, whose followers he urges\r\nthem to become.\r\n\r\nAs regards the maintenance of the missions, I do not for one moment\r\ndoubt that the liberality of the Roman Catholics of the United States\r\nis quite equal to the needs of the pioneers of civilisation, who have\r\nlaboured with such remarkable success.\r\n\r\nAltogether the Jesuits administered the spiritual, and some of the\r\ntemporal affairs of 200,000 Christians in Mindanao.\r\n\r\nThey educated the young, taught them handicrafts, attended to the\r\nsick, consoled the afflicted, reconciled those at variance, explored\r\nthe country, encouraged agriculture, built churches, laid out roads,\r\nand assisted the Administration. Finally, when bands of slave-hunting,\r\nmurdering Moros swept down like wolves on their flocks, they placed\r\nthemselves at the head of their ill-armed parishioners and led them\r\ninto battle against a ferocious enemy who gives no quarter, with\r\nthe calmness of men who, long before, had devoted their lives to the\r\nMaster's cause, to whom nothing in this world is of any consequence\r\nexcept the advancement of the Faith and the performance of duty.\r\n\r\nThey received very meagre monetary assistance from the Spanish\r\nGovernment, and had to depend greatly upon the pious offerings of\r\nthe devout in Barcelona and in Madrid. It is to be feared that these\r\nsubscriptions will now fall off as Spain has lost the islands; if so,\r\nit is all the more incumbent upon the Roman Catholics of America to\r\nfind the means of continuing the good work.\r\n\r\nI feel sure that this will be so--Christian charity will not fail,\r\nand the missions will be maintained.\r\n\r\nFor their devotion and zeal, I beg to offer the Jesuit missionaries\r\nmy profound respect and my earnest wishes for their welfare under\r\nthe Stars and Stripes.\r\n\r\nTo my mind, they realise very closely the ideal of what a Christian\r\nmissionary should be. Although a Protestant born and bred, I see in\r\nthat no reason to close my eyes to their obvious merit, nor to seek to\r\nbe-little the great good they have done in Mindanao. Far from doing so,\r\nI wish to state my conviction that the easiest, the best, and the most\r\nhumane way of pacifying Mindanao is by utilising the powerful influence\r\nof the Jesuit missionaries with their flocks, and this before it is\r\ntoo late, before the populations have had time to completely forget\r\nthe Christian teaching, and to entirely relapse into barbarism.\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Posts in Mindanao Garrisoned by Detachments of the Native\r\nArmy with Spanish Officers in 1894.\r\n\r\n                                 Field Officers.\r\n                                         Officers.\r\n                                                 Men.\r\n1st District.\r\n\r\n    San Ramon                    ..        1      12 Infantry.\r\n    Santa Maria                  ..        1      34 Infantry.\r\n    Margos-sa-tubig              ..        2      60 Infantry.\r\n\r\n2nd District.\r\n    Fort Weyler, Mumungan         1        7     321 Infantry.\r\n    Fort Weyler, Mumungan        ..        1      18 Artillery.\r\n    Fort Weyler, Mumungan        ..        2     112 Engineers.\r\n    Fort Weyler, Mumungan        ..        1      30 Cavalry.\r\n    Fort Weyler, Mumungan        ..        3     158 Disciplinary Battn.\r\n    Iligan                       ..        1      30 Tercio\r\n    Civil.\r\n    Almonte                      ..        2      58 Infantry.\r\n    Almonte                      ..       ..       8 Artillery.\r\n    Almonte                      ..        1      20 Disciplinary Battn.\r\n    Tangok, Alfonso XIII.        ..        1      20 Infantry.\r\n    Balatacan, Infanta Isabel    ..        1      20 Infantry.\r\n    Trocha de Tucuran, Sta.

War against Mindanao and Jolo, parts of which are\r\noccupied. Disputes between the missionaries and the military\r\nofficers who desire to enrich themselves by enslaving the natives,\r\nwhich the former stoutly oppose, desiring to convert them, and grant\r\nthem exemption from taxes according to the \"Leyes de Indias.\" They\r\nconsidered the cupidity of the soldiers as the chief obstacle to\r\nthe conversion of the heathen. The Crown decided in favour of the\r\nnatives, but they did not derive all the benefits they were entitled\r\nto, as the humane laws were not respected by the governors.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans arrived in Manila.\r\n\r\n1580. Expedition sent by Gonzalo Ronquillo to Borneo to assist\r\nKing Sirela.\r\n\r\n1581. Expedition sent by the same to Cagayan to expel a Japanese\r\ncorsair who had established himself there.

In the silence of the night, when\r\nthe Spaniards were asleep, the galley-slaves arose and killed them\r\nall except a Franciscan friar and a secretary. Dasmarinias built the\r\ncastle of Santiago, and fortified Manila with stone walls, cast a\r\nlarge number of guns, and established the college of Sta. Potenciana.\r\n\r\n1596. The galleon which left Manila for Acapulco with rich\r\nmerchandise, was obliged to enter a Japanese port by stress of weather,\r\nand was seized by the Japanese authorities.

Destructive earthquake in Manila and neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n1600. Great sea combat between four Spanish ships, commanded by\r\nJudge Morga, and two Dutch pirates. One of the Dutchmen was taken,\r\nbut the other escaped.\r\n\r\nAnother destructive earthquake on January 7th, and one less violent,\r\nbut long, in November.\r\n\r\n1603. Conspiracy of Eng-Cang and the Chinese against the\r\nSpaniards. The Chinese entrench themselves near Manila; Luis Perez\r\nDasmarinias marches against them with 130 Spaniards. They were all\r\nkilled and decapitated by the Chinese, who then besieged Manila, and\r\nattempted to take it by assault. Being repulsed by the Spaniards,\r\nall of whom, including the friars, took up arms, they retired to\r\ntheir entrenchments. They were ultimately defeated, and 23,000 of\r\nthem were massacred. Only 100 were left alive, and these were sent\r\nto the galleys as slaves.\r\n\r\n1606. The Recollets arrive in Manila.\r\n\r\nFourth expedition against the Molucas. Pedro de Acuna, having received\r\na reinforcement of 800 men--Mexicans and Peruvians--attacked and took\r\nTernate, Tidore, Marotoy and Herrao, with all their artillery and\r\nprovisions.

Long series of strong earthquakes, which began in March with\r\nviolent shocks, and lasted for sixty days.\r\n\r\n1648. Great earthquakes in Manila.\r\n\r\n1653. Great devastations by the Moros of Mindanao, which were\r\nseverely punished.\r\n\r\nRebellion in Pampanga and Pangasinan against being forced to cut\r\ntimber gratuitously for the navy.

Destructive earthquake in South Luzon and Mindoro.\r\n\r\n1683. Great earthquake in Manila.\r\n\r\n1689. Archbishop Pardo having died, was succeeded by P. Camacho,\r\nand now great disorders arose from his insisting on making the diocesan\r\nvisit, which the friars refused to receive, and would only be visited\r\nby their own Provincial. Again Judge Sierra required the Augustinians\r\nand Dominicans to present the titles of the estates they possessed\r\nin virtue of a special commission he had brought from Madrid, which\r\nthey refused to obey, and the end of the dispute was that Sierra was\r\nsent back to Mexico, and another commissioner, a friend of the friars,\r\nwas appointed, to whom they unofficially exhibited the titles.\r\n\r\n1716. Destructive eruption of the Taal volcano, and violent\r\nearthquake in Manila.\r\n\r\n1717. Fernando Bustillo Bustamente became governor, and\r\nre-established garrisons in Zamboanga and Paragua. He caused various\r\npersons who had embezzled the funds of the colony to restore them,\r\nimprisoning a corrupt judge. He was assassinated by the criminals he\r\nhad punished, and nothing came of the inquiry into his death.\r\n\r\n1735. Earthquake in Baler, and tidal wave.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the audacity of the Moro pirates was incredible. They\r\nravaged the Visayas and southern Luzon, and carried away the\r\ninhabitants by thousands for slaves. The natives began to desert the\r\ncoast, and take to the interior. Pedro Manuel de Arandia, obeying\r\nrepeated orders, decreed the expulsion of the Chinese.\r\n\r\n1744. Another rising in Bohol, due to the tyranny of a Jesuit priest\r\nnamed Morales. The chief of this rising was a native named Dagohoy,\r\nwho put the Jesuit to death, and maintained the independence of\r\nBohol, paying no tribute for thirty-five years. When the Jesuits\r\nwere expelled from the Philippines, Recollets were sent to Bohol,\r\nand the natives submitted on receiving a free pardon.\r\n\r\n1749. Eruption of the Taal volcano, and earthquake in Manila. The\r\neruption lasted for twenty days.\r\n\r\n1754. Violent eruption of the Taal volcano, which began on 15th\r\nMay, and lasted till the end of November. This was accompanied\r\nby earthquakes, an inundation, terrifying electrical discharges,\r\nand destructive storms. The ashes darkened the country for miles\r\nround, even as far as Manila. When the eruption ceased, the stench\r\nwas dreadful, and the sea and lake threw up quantities of dead fish\r\nand alligators. A malignant fever burst out, which carried off vast\r\nnumbers of the population round about the volcano.\r\n\r\n1762. A British squadron, with troops from India, arrived in the\r\nbay 22nd September, and landed the forces near the powder-magazine of\r\nS. Antonio Abad. On the 24th, the city was bombarded. The Spaniards\r\nsent out 2000 Pampangos to attack the British, but they were repulsed\r\nwith great slaughter, and ran away to their own country.\r\n\r\nThe civil population of Manila were decidedly in favour of resisting\r\nto the last drop of the soldiers' blood; but the soldiers were not at\r\nall anxious for this. Confusion arose in the city, and whilst\r\nrecriminations were in progress, the British took the city by assault,\r\nmeeting only a half-hearted resistance.\r\n\r\nThe natives immediately began plundering, and were turned out of the\r\ncity by General Draper. The Chinese also joined in the robbery, and a\r\nfew were hanged in consequence. The city was pillaged. The British\r\nregiments are said to have behaved well, but the sepoys ravished the\r\nwomen, and killed many natives.\r\n\r\nCavite was about to be surrendered, but as soon as the native troops\r\nthere knew what was going on, they began at once to plunder the town\r\nand arsenal.\r\n\r\n1763. A British expedition sailing in small craft took possession\r\nof Malolos on January 19th, 1763. The Augustin and Franciscan friars\r\ntook arms to defend Bulacan, where two of them were killed in action.\r\n\r\nIt was said that the Chinese were conspiring to exterminate the\r\nSpaniards. Simon de Anda, the chief of the war-party amongst the\r\nSpaniards, issued an order that all the Chinese in the Philippines\r\nshould be hanged, and this order was in a great measure carried\r\nout. This was the fourth time the Spaniards and natives exterminated\r\nthe Chinese in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nPeace having been made in Europe, the British evacuated Manila\r\nin March, 1774.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy their vanity, and account for the easy victory\r\nof the British, the Spaniards made various accusations of treachery\r\nagainst a brave Frenchman named Falles, and a Mexican, Santiago de\r\nOrendain. Both those men gallantly led columns of Pampangos against\r\nthe British lines in the sortie before mentioned. Although the\r\nPampangos, full of presumption, boldly advanced against the British\r\nand sepoys, they were no match for disciplined troops led by British\r\nofficers, and were hurled back at the point of the bayonet. The\r\ninevitable defeat and rout was made a pretext for the infamous charges\r\nagainst their leaders. It may be asked, Was there no Spaniard brave\r\nenough to lead the sorties, that a Frenchman and a Mexican were\r\nobliged to take command?\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards in this campaign showed themselves more at home in\r\nmaking proclamations, accusations, and intriguing against each other,\r\nthan in fighting. However, the friars are exempt from this reproach,\r\nfor Augustinians, Dominicans and Franciscans, fought and died, and\r\nshamed the soldiers.\r\n\r\nNo less than ten Augustinians fell on the field of battle, nineteen\r\nwere made prisoners, and twelve were banished. The British are said\r\nby the Augustinians to have sacked and destroyed fifteen of their\r\nconventos, or priests' houses, six houses of their haciendas, and to\r\nhave sold everything belonging to them in Manila. The Augustinians\r\ngave their church bells to be cast into cannon for the defence of\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\nSpaniards and natives, however, showed great unanimity and enthusiasm\r\nin massacring or hanging the unwarlike Chinamen, and in pillaging their\r\ngoods. Nearly all the Chinese in the islands, except those in the parts\r\nheld by the British, were killed.\r\n\r\nDuring the Anglo-Spanish war there were revolts of the natives in\r\nPangasinan and in Ilocos, then a very large province (it is now divided\r\ninto four), but both these risings were suppressed. The same happened\r\nwith a revolt in Cagayan. Disturbances also occurred in many other\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nSimon de Anda became Governor-General, and carried out the expulsion of\r\nthe Jesuits from the Philippines. Great troubles again occurred between\r\nthe Archbishop and the friars over the diocesan visit.\r\n\r\n1766. 20th July, violent eruption of the Mayon volcano.\r\n\r\n23rd October, terrible typhoon in Albay, causing enormous destruction\r\nof life and property.\r\n\r\n1777. Jose Basco y Vargas, a naval officer, came out as\r\nGovernor-General, and found the country overrun with banditti. He made\r\na war of extermination against them, and then initiated a vigorous\r\ncampaign against the Moros. He repaired the forts, built numbers of\r\nwar vessels, and cut up the pirates in many encounters. Basco governed\r\nfor nearly eleven years.\r\n\r\n1784. During the government of Felix Marquina, a naval officer, the\r\nCompania de Filipinas was founded to commence a trade between Spain and\r\nthe Philippines. Marquina was succeeded by Rafael Maria de Aguilar,\r\nan army officer, who organized the land and naval forces, and made\r\nfierce war on the Moros. He governed the islands for fourteen years.\r\n\r\n1787. Violent and destructive earthquake in Panay.\r\n\r\n1796. Disastrous earthquake in Manila.\r\n\r\n1800. Destructive eruption of the Mayon volcano.\r\n\r\n1807. Rebellion in Ilocos.\r\n\r\nWhen the parish priest of Betal, an Augustinian, was preaching to his\r\nflock, exhorting them to obedience to their sovereign, a woman stood\r\nup in the church and spoke against him, saying that they should not\r\nbelieve him, that his remarks were all humbug, that with the pretence\r\nof God, the Gospel, and the King, the priest merely deceived them, so\r\nthat the Spaniards might skin them and suck their blood, for the\r\npriests were Spaniards like the rest. However, the townsmen declared\r\nfor the King, and took the field under the leadership of the priest.\r\n\r\n1809. The first English commercial house established in Manila.\r\n\r\n1811. Rebellion in Ilocos to change the religion, nominating a\r\nnew god called Lungao. The leaders of this rebellion entered into\r\nnegotiations with the Igorrotes and other wild tribes to exterminate\r\nthe Spaniards, but the conspiracy was discovered and frustrated.\r\n\r\n1814. Rebellion in Ilocos and other provinces.\r\n\r\nPrisoners released in some towns in Ilocos. This rebellion was in\r\nconsequence of General Gandaras proclaiming the equality of races,\r\nwhich the Indians interpreted by refusing to pay taxes.\r\n\r\n1st February, violent earthquake in south Luzon and destructive\r\neruption of the Mayon volcano. Astonishing electrical discharges.\r\n\r\nA discharge of ashes caused five hours' absolute darkness, through\r\nwhich fell showers of red hot stones which completely burnt the towns\r\nof Camalig, Cagsana, and Budiao with half of the towns of Albay and\r\nGuinchatau, and part of Bulusan.\r\n\r\nThe darkness caused by the black ashes reached over the whole of Luzon,\r\nand even to the coast of China. So loud was the thunder that it was\r\nheard in distant parts of the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nGreat epidemic of cholera in Manila.\r\n\r\n1820. Massacre of French, English, and Americans in Manila by the\r\nnatives who plundered their dwellings, after which they proceeded with\r\nthe fifth massacre of the Chinese. They asserted that the Europeans had\r\npoisoned the wells and produced the cholera. The massacre was due to\r\nthe villainous behaviour of a Philippine Spaniard named Varela, who was\r\nAlcalde of Tondo, equivalent to Governor of Manila, and to the criminal\r\nweakness and cowardice of Folgueras the acting governor-general, who\r\nabstained from interference until the foreigners had been killed,\r\nand only sent out troops when forced by the remonstrances of the\r\nfriars and other Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop and the friars behaved nobly, for they marched out in\r\nprocession to the streets of Binondo, and did their best to stop the\r\nmassacre, whilst Folgueras, only attentive to his own safety, remained\r\nwith the fortifications.\r\n\r\n1822. Juan Antonio Martinez took over the government in\r\nOctober. Folgueras having reported unfavourably of the officers of\r\nthe Philippine army, Martinez brought with him a number of officers\r\nof the Peninsular army to replace those who were inefficient.\r\n\r\nThis caused a mutiny of the Spanish officers of the native army, and\r\nthey murdered Folgueras in his bed. He thus expiated his cowardice in\r\n1820. The mutiny was, however, suppressed, and Novales and twenty\r\nsergeants were shot. Novales' followers had proclaimed him Emperor of\r\nthe Philippines. The constitution was abolished by Martinez, without\r\ncausing any rising.\r\n\r\n1824. Destructive earthquake in Manila.\r\n\r\nAlonzo Morgado appointed by Martinez to be captain of the Marina Sutil,\r\ncommenced an unrelenting persecution of the piratical Moros, causing\r\nthem enormous losses.\r\n\r\n1828. Another military insurrection, headed by two brothers,\r\nofficers in the Philippine army.\r\n\r\nFrom this date Peninsular troops were permanently maintained in Manila,\r\nwhich had never been done before.\r\n\r\n1829. Father Bernardo Lago, an indefatigable missionary of the\r\nAugustinian Order, with his assistants baptised in the provinces of\r\nAbra and Benguet more than 5300 heathen Tinguianes and Igorrotes,\r\nand settled them in towns.\r\n\r\n1834. Foreign vessels allowed to enter Manila by paying double dues.\r\n\r\n1836-7. Great disturbances amongst the natives in consequence of\r\nthe ex-claustration of the friars in Spain. The natives divided into\r\ntwo parties. One wished to turn out the friars and all Spaniards,\r\nthe others to turn out all Spaniards except the friars, who were to\r\nremain and take charge of the government.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances were ultimately smoothed over.\r\n\r\n1841. Marcelino de Oraa being Governor-General, a sanguinary\r\ninsurrection burst out in Tayabas, under the leadership of a native,\r\nApolinario de la Cruz. He murdered the Alcalde of the province, and\r\npersuaded his fanatical adherents that he would make the earth open\r\nand swallow up the Spanish forces when they attacked.\r\n\r\nHis following was composed of 3000 men, women, and children. They were\r\nattacked by four hundred soldiers and as many cuadrilleros and\r\ncoast-guards, and suffered a crushing defeat, and a third of them were\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nApolinario de la Cruz was apprehended, and immediately put to death.\r\n\r\nApolinario called himself the \"King of the Tagals,\" and told his\r\nfollowers that a Tagal virgin would come down from Heaven to wed him,\r\nthat with a handful of rice he could maintain all who followed him,\r\nand that the Spanish bullets could not hurt them, and many other\r\nabsurd things. His followers declared that he had signified his\r\nintention, in case of being victorious, to tie all the friars and other\r\nSpaniards to trees, and to have them shot by the women with arrows.\r\n\r\nThere lay in garrison at Manila at this time a regiment composed of\r\nTagals of Tayabas, and they also mutinied, and were shot down by\r\nthe other troops.\r\n\r\n1844. Royal order prohibiting the admission of foreigners to the\r\ninterior of the country.\r\n\r\nNarciso de Claveria became Governor-General, and organised a police\r\nforce called the Public Safety for Manila, and similar corps for the\r\nprovinces. Up to this time the Alcaldes Mayores of provinces had been\r\nallowed to trade, and, in fact, were almost the only traders in their\r\nprovinces, buying up the whole crop. This forced trade is quite a\r\nMalay custom, and is practised in Borneo and the Malay States under\r\nthe name of Serra-dagang.\r\n\r\nThe Alcaldes Mayores used to pay the crown one third, or half, or all\r\ntheir salary for this privilege, and took in return all they could\r\nsqueeze out of their provinces without causing an insurrection, or\r\nwithout causing the friars to complain of them to the Government, for\r\nthe parish priests were ever the protectors of the natives against the\r\ncivil authority. This privilege of trading was now abolished as being\r\nunworthy of the position of governor of a province.\r\n\r\n1851. Expedition by the Governor-General Antonio de Urbiztondo\r\nagainst Jolo. The force consisted of four regiments, with artillery,\r\nand a battalion of the inhabitants of Cebu, under the command of a\r\nRecollet friar, Father Ibanez. These latter behaved in the bravest\r\nmanner, in fact they had to; for their wives, at the instance of the\r\npriest, had sworn never to receive them again if they turned their\r\nbacks on the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe undaunted Father Ibanez led them to the assault, and lost his life\r\nin the moment of victory. Eight cottas (forts), with their artillery\r\nand ammunition, were captured by this expedition, and a great number\r\nof Moros were killed.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Jolo pirates abated their insolent attacks. Claveria\r\nmade an expedition against the piratical Moros and seized their island\r\nof Balanguingin, killing 400 Moros, and taking 300 prisoners, also\r\nrescuing 200 captives. He also captured 120 guns and lantacas, and\r\n150 piratical vessels. This exemplary chastisement tranquillised the\r\nMoros for some time.\r\n\r\n1853. 13th June. Loud subterranean noises in Albay and eruption of\r\nthe Mayon volcano. Fall of ashes and red-hot stones which rolled down\r\nthe mountain and killed thirty-three people.\r\n\r\n1854. Insurrection in Nueva Ecija under Cuesta, a Spanish mestizo\r\neducated in Spain, where Queen Isabela had taken notice of him.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in Manila with the appointment of Commandant of Carabineros\r\nin Nueva Ecija, and immediately began to plot. The Augustine friars\r\nharangued his followers and persuaded them to disperse, and Cuesta was\r\ncaptured and executed, with several other conspirators; others were\r\nbanished to distant islands.\r\n\r\nIn this year Manuel Crespo became Governor-General, and a military\r\nofficer, named Zapatero, endeavoured to strangle him in his own office.\r\n\r\n1855. Strong shocks of earthquake in all Luzon. Eruption of the\r\nMayon volcano.\r\n\r\n1856. In the latter part of this year a submarine volcanic explosion\r\ntook place at the Didica shoal, eight miles north-east of the island\r\nof Camiguin in the Babuyanes, to the north of Luzon. It remains an\r\nactive volcano, and has raised a cone nearly to the height of the\r\nvolcano of Camiguin, which is 2414 feet high.\r\n\r\n1857. The old decrees against foreigners renewed.\r\n\r\nFernando de Norzagaray became governor-general, and found the country\r\nover-run by bandits, against whom he employed severe measures. He\r\ngreatly improved Manila.\r\n\r\nThe French in Cochin-China, finding more resistance than they expected,\r\nappealed to Norzagaray for help. He lent them money, ships, and about\r\na thousand native troops, who behaved with great bravery during the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n1860. Ramon Maria Solano succeeded to the Government.\r\n\r\nIn this year two steam sloops and nine steam gunboats were added to\r\nthe naval forces, and now the Moros could only put to sea running\r\ngreat risks of destruction.\r\n\r\nThese nine gunboats were the greatest blessings the Philippines\r\nhad received for many years.\r\n\r\n1861. Jose de Lemery y Ibarrola, Governor-General. Mendez-Nunez,\r\nwith the steam sloops and gunboats, inflicted terrible chastisement\r\non the piratical Moros.\r\n\r\n1862. Rafael de Echague y Bermingham became Governor-General.\r\n\r\nSecond visitation of cholera in the islands, but not so severe\r\nas in 1820.\r\n\r\n1863. Terrible earthquake in Manila and the surrounding country,\r\ncausing thousands of victims, destroying the cathedral, the palace\r\nof the governor-general, the custom houses, the principal churches\r\n(except St. Augustine), the public and private buildings, in fact,\r\nreducing the city to a ruin.\r\n\r\nAt this time the steam gunboats continually hostilised the Moros of\r\nJolo, and caused them great losses.\r\n\r\n1865. Juan de Lara y Irigoyen became Governor-General, and\r\ntook measures to subdue the bandits, who were committing great\r\ndepredations and murders. Hostilities continued in Jolo, as the Moros\r\nhad recommenced their piratical cruises.\r\n\r\n1866. Frequent earthquakes in Manila and Benguet.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Treasury was in the greatest difficulty, and could\r\nnot meet the current payments. A large quantity of tobacco was sold\r\nto meet the difficulty.\r\n\r\n1867. Jose de la Gandara y Navarro became Governor-General. To him\r\nis due the credit of creating that excellent institution the Guardia\r\nCivil, which has extirpated the banditti who infested the islands\r\nfor so many years.\r\n\r\nAn expedition was sent against the Igorrotes, but without effecting\r\nanything of consequence.\r\n\r\n1868. June 4th. Intense earthquake in the island of Leyte.\r\n\r\n1869. Carlos Maria de la Torre became Governor-General, and was not\r\nashamed to publish a proclamation offering the bandits a free pardon if\r\nthey presented themselves within three months. Hundreds and thousands\r\nof men now joined the bandits for three months murder and pillage, with\r\na free pardon at the end of it. This idiotic and cowardly proclamation\r\nwas most prejudicial to the interests of the country. Finally a special\r\ncorps, called La Torre's Guides, was organised to pursue the bandits.\r\n\r\n1871. Rafael Izquierdo y Guttierez became Governor-General, and\r\nraised the excellent corps called La Veterana to act as the police\r\nof the capital.\r\n\r\nDecember 8th, eruption of the Mayon volcano, and discharge of ashes\r\nand lava. Two persons smothered, and one burnt.\r\n\r\n16th February. Commencement of the series of earthquakes which\r\npreceded the frightful volcanic eruption in the island of Camiguin\r\non 30th April. Full details of this terrible event are preserved. A\r\nvolcanic outburst took place on the above date at 344 metres from\r\nthe town of Cabarman, and near the sea. Great volumes of inflammable\r\ngases were ejected from deep cracks in the neighbouring hills,\r\nwhich presently took fire, and soared in flames of incredible height,\r\nsetting fire to the forests. The wretched inhabitants who had remained\r\nin their houses found themselves surrounded by smoke, steam, water,\r\nashes, and red hot stones, whilst their island seemed on fire, and they\r\nhad sent away all their seaworthy craft with the women and children.\r\n\r\nAt first the volcanic vent was only two metres high, but it continually\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAfter the eruption, the earthquakes decreased, and on 7th May entirely\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThe volcano gradually raised itself by the material thrown out to a\r\nheight of 418 metres.\r\n\r\n1872. Military revolt in Cavite, in which the native clergy were\r\nmixed up. A secret society had been working at this plot for several\r\nyears, and was very widely extended. It inundated the towns of the\r\nArchipelago with calumnious and libellous leaflets in the native\r\nlanguages. The conspiracy coincided with the return of the Jesuits in\r\naccordance with a Royal Order, and their substitution for the Recollets\r\nmissionaries in many parishes in Mindanao. In turn, the Recollets,\r\nremoved from Mindanao, were given benefices in Luzon which, for one\r\nhundred years, had been in the hands of the native clergy, who were,\r\nin consequence, very dissatisfied, and great hatred was aroused\r\nagainst the Recollets. The mutiny was suppressed by the Spaniards\r\nand the Visayas troops, who bayoneted the Tagals without mercy,\r\neven when they had laid down their arms.\r\n\r\nBesides many who were shot for complicity in this revolt, three native\r\npriests--D. Mariano Gomez, D. Jacinto Zamora, and D. Jose Burgos--were\r\ngarrotted in Bagumbayan on the 28th February. Much discussion arose\r\nabout the guilt or innocence of these men, and it is a matter on which\r\nfriars and native clergy are never likely to agree.\r\n\r\nLater on, a rising took place in Zamboanga penal establishment, but\r\nthis was put down by the warlike inhabitants of that town, who are\r\nalways ready to take up arms in their own defence, and are very loyal\r\nto Spain.\r\n\r\nLoud subterranean noises in Albay. Eruption of the Mayon volcano, which\r\nlasted for four days.\r\n\r\n1873. Juan de Alaminos y Vivar became governor-general.\r\n\r\nThe ports of Legaspi, Tacloban and Leyte, were opened to foreign\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nNovember 14, 1873, violent earthquake in Manila. Eruption of the\r\nMayon volcano, from 15th June to 23rd July.\r\n\r\n1874. Manuel Blanco Valderrama, being acting governor-general,\r\nfighting took place in Balabac, where the Spanish garrison was\r\nsurprised by the Moros. Jose Malcampo y Monge, a rear-admiral, took\r\nover the government of the islands, and, during his administration,\r\nthe news of the proclamation of Alfonso XII, as King of Spain was\r\nreceived, and gave great satisfaction in Manila, which had never\r\ntaken to the Republican Government in Spain.\r\n\r\nMalcampo led a strong expedition, consisting of 9000 men, against the\r\nMoros, and took Jolo by assault, after bombarding the Cottas by the\r\nships' guns. At the end of his time, the regiment of Peninsular\r\nArtillery had become demoralised, and its discipline very lax. Finally,\r\nthe soldiers refused to obey their officers, and broke out of barracks.\r\n\r\nTwo of them were shot dead by the officer of the guard at the\r\nbarrack-gate, Captain Brull, but the affair was hushed up, and\r\nno one was punished. Discipline was quite lost.\r\n\r\n1877. Great devastation by locusts in province of Batangas. Domingo\r\nMoriones y Murillo arrived, and took over the government on 28th\r\nFebruary. His first act was to shoot a number of the Spanish mutineers,\r\nput others in prison, and send back fifty to Spain in the same vessel\r\nwith Malcampo. This incident is related in greater detail in Chapter\r\nIII. The Treasury was in the greatest poverty, and the poor natives of\r\nCagayan obliged to cultivate tobacco and deliver it to the government\r\nofficials, had not been paid for it for two or three years, and were\r\nactually starving. Moriones did what he could for them, and strongly\r\ninsisted on the abolition of the \"estanco.\"\r\n\r\nTo this worthy governor, Manila and the Philippines owe much. He\r\ninsisted on the legacy of Carriedo being employed for the object\r\nit was left for, instead of remaining in the hands of corrupt\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nHe also made good regulations against rogues and vagabonds.\r\n\r\n1879. Nov. 8th. Violent typhoon passed over Manila, doing much\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nJuly 1st. Commencement of earthquakes in Surigao (Mindanao), which\r\nlasted over two months.\r\n\r\n1880. Fernando Primo de Rivera became Governor-General, 15th April.\r\n\r\nOn July 14th, a violent earthquake took place, doing enormous damage\r\nin the city of Manila and the central provinces of Luzon. The seismic\r\ndisturbance lasted till the 25th July. The inhabitants of Manila were\r\npanic-stricken, and took refuge in the native nipa houses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Primo de Rivera made an expedition against the Igorrotes, and\r\nthe vile treatment the soldiers meted out to the Igorrote women has\r\ndelayed for years the conversion of those tribes.\r\n\r\n1881. Eruption of the Mayon volcano, which began on July 6th,\r\nand lasted till the middle of 1882.\r\n\r\nAt times there were loud subterranean noises, after which the flow of\r\nlava usually increased.\r\n\r\n1882. Dreadful epidemic of cholera which, in less than three months,\r\ncarried off 30,000 victims in the city and province of Manila. In the\r\nheight of the epidemic the deaths reached a thousand a day. The victims\r\nwere mostly natives, but many Spaniards died of the disease. Only\r\none Englishman died, and this was from his own imprudence. A typhoon\r\npassed over Manila on October 20th, and caused great damage on shore\r\nand afloat. Twelve large ships and a steamer were driven on shore,\r\nor very seriously damaged.\r\n\r\nOn November 5th, another typhoon, not quite so violent as the first,\r\ntook place. After this, the cholera almost entirely stopped. On\r\nDecember 31st, another typhoon occurred.\r\n\r\n1883. Joaquin Jovellar y Soler, captain-general in the army, and\r\nthe pacificator of Cuba, assumed the government 7th April, and was\r\nreceived with great show of satisfaction by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nThe old tribute of the natives was replaced by the tax on the\r\nCedulas-personales.\r\n\r\nDuring his time there were threats of insurrection, and additional\r\nPeninsular troops were sent out. He resigned from ill-health\r\n1st April, 1885.\r\n\r\nOctober 28th. Typhoon passed over Manila.\r\n\r\n1885. Emilio Terrero y Perinat assumed the government of the islands\r\non April 4th.\r\n\r\nHe conducted successful expeditions against the Moros of Mindanao\r\nand Jolo.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, during the great heat, the River Pasig was covered\r\nwith green scum from the lake.
