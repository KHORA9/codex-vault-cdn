With these\r\ngreat “primary” authorities may perhaps be ranked the face and voice\r\nof modern Germany, rich in evidence of Frederick’s work, which have\r\ndoubtless influenced my opinions more than I am aware of. Among\r\n“secondary” authorities I owe most to the opulent treasure-house of\r\nCarlyle’s _Frederick the Great_ and to the more systematic narrative\r\nof Professor Koser. His _Friedrich der Grosse als Kronprinz_, which\r\nlargely inspired the work of Lavisse translated under the title _The\r\nYouth of Frederick the Great_, forms my chief source for much of\r\nFrederick’s early life, as does the last volume of the _König Friedrich\r\nder Grosse_ (1903), for the domestic labours after 1763. Mr. Herbert\r\nTuttle’s judicious _History of Prussia_ gave me much assistance down to\r\nthe outbreak of the Seven Years’ War, and I have often referred to Mr.\r\nLodge’s _Modern Europe_ and Mr. Henderson’s _Short History of Germany_.\r\n\r\nAt critical points in the record of the years 1712 to 1786 I was\r\ninfluenced successively by the _Mémoires de la Margravine de Baireuth_,\r\nthe trenchant _Frédéric II et Marie-Thérèse_ of the Duc de Broglie,\r\nthe _Politische Staatsschriften_, Schäfer’s _Der Siebenjährige Krieg_,\r\nvon Arneth’s _Oesterreichische Geschichte_, and Sorel’s _The Eastern\r\nQuestion in the Eighteenth Century_. Many of the battles in Saxony,\r\nBrandenburg, Bohemia, and Silesia form the subject of monographs which\r\nit was interesting to study on the field, sometimes with the aid of\r\ncollections of maps and plans preserved in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible without a false pretence of erudition to name\r\nmore than a small portion of the books to which some reference must be\r\nmade in writing of the rise of Prussia. Students will recognise the\r\ndebt that I owe to such well-known works as those of Ranke, Droysen,\r\nPhilippson, Förster, Seeley, Isaacsohn, Oncken, Vitzthum, Archenholtz,\r\nand many more, as well as to the _Essays_ of Macaulay and Lord Mahon.\r\nMy account of the early history of Brandenburg is in part based on my\r\npaper of April, 1901, in the _Transactions_ of the Royal Historical\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nI offer my grateful thanks to Mr. G. H. Putnam and to Mr. H. W. C.\r\nDavis for their counsel, to Mr. G. H. M. Gray for minute scrutiny\r\nof the proof-sheets, and to Messrs. Ernest and Harold Temperley, my\r\nindulgent comrades in Silesia. To the latter this book owes much at\r\nevery stage.\r\n\r\n            W. F. R.\r\n\r\n  KING’S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE,\r\n      Jan. 9th, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n  INTRODUCTION                                                         1\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n       THE RISE OF PRUSSIA                                             3\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n       FREDERICK AS CROWN PRINCE, 1712–1740                           24\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n       THE PROBLEM OF 1740                                            56\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n       THE SILESIAN ADVENTURE, 1740–1742                              83\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n       THE SECOND STRUGGLE FOR SILESIA, 1742–1745                    128\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n       THE TEN YEARS’ PEACE, 1746–1756                               155\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII\r\n       THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR TO THE BATTLE OF LEUTHEN                 189\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII\r\n       THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR (CONTINUED).

In the heart of imperial Vienna\r\nis seated the colossal figure of Maria Theresa, the Victoria of an age\r\nwhen a Pompadour could sway the fate of nations. Her effigy presents\r\nher as the mother of her people, displaying rather than obscuring the\r\nscholars, statesmen, and warriors who cluster round her feet, sharing\r\nharmoniously the glory which neither Queen nor people could have won\r\nwithout the other’s aid.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin the superb monument of the Great Frederick is instinct with\r\na different spirit. Raised high above the throng, the King seems to\r\ngaze with his inscrutable mask-face at the astounding works of his\r\nsuccessors. At the base of his lofty pedestal are stationed generals\r\nand civilians of renown, numerous enough almost to confute the Cassius\r\nwho should infer of Frederick’s Prussia that there was in it but\r\none only man. The statue none the less suggests the truth. Between\r\nmonarch and people there was ever a great gulf fixed. Through all\r\nhis life—in his counsels, in his despair, in his triumph, and in his\r\ndeath—Frederick, almost beyond parallel in the record of human history,\r\nwas alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF PRUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first task of the student of Frederick’s life-story is to rid\r\nhimself of the idea that the solitary King was either wholly original\r\nor wholly free. To seize Silesia, to quarter Poland, to rival Austria,\r\nto humble France, each was no doubt a feat which no Prussian ruler\r\nbefore him had dared to attempt. Yet in each of these, as will\r\npresently be shown, the hand of the living was at once nerved and\r\nguided by the dead. From his House Frederick inherited his might,\r\nto his House he turned for inspiration in the use of it, and to it\r\nhe dedicated his conquests. He who would appreciate Frederick must\r\nfirst survey the road trodden for three centuries before him by the\r\nHohenzollerns from whom he sprang.\r\n\r\n“Why should I serve the Hohenzollerns?” Bismarck is said to have\r\nexclaimed. “My family is as good as theirs.” It was the complaint\r\nof the yeoman against his fellow who has saved money and bought the\r\nlordship of the manor.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the state now called Prussia is chiefly the record\r\nof a thrifty family—the Hohenzollerns. Since the year 1415, when\r\nthe overlordship of the sandy tract lying between the middle Elbe\r\nand lower Oder and stretching across their banks was conferred upon\r\nhim by the Emperor for cash down, Frederick of Hohenzollern and his\r\ndescendants had remained lords of Brandenburg. From Nuremberg, where\r\nFrederick had been Burggrave, they had brought with them the vital\r\nenergy and business ability of successful townsmen. So poor was their\r\nnew estate that for many generations relaxation would have meant ruin.\r\nThere was therefore no temptation to depart from that policy of adding\r\nfield to field which is the natural law of the industrious countryman.\r\nWhether from native superiority or from greater need, the Hohenzollerns\r\nwere usually a little wiser than their neighbours. With the aid of a\r\nfamily statute of 1473, which made primogeniture the rule of succession\r\nfor Brandenburg, they avoided the consequences of that custom of equal\r\ninheritance which has been the bane of Germany. By careful watching of\r\nopportunities, by windfalls, by purchase, and by covenants for mutual\r\nsuccession on failure of heirs made with neighbours whose lines died\r\nout, the domain of the rulers of Brandenburg was in two centuries\r\nincreased fourfold. When the Thirty Years’ War broke out and the modern\r\nhistory of Prussia began, the head of the Hohenzollern family, who had\r\nlong since become one of the seven Electors of the Empire, held sway\r\nover an area almost as great as that of Ireland.\r\n\r\nOf the territories by which the original Mark of Brandenburg had been\r\naugmented, two were of special importance. In 1525 East Prussia had\r\nbeen acquired. This province, which throughout this book will be\r\ncalled by its German name of Ost-Preussen, was richer by far than the\r\nMark, the kernel of the Hohenzollern possessions. It had an important\r\ncity, Königsberg, for its capital and a coast-line on the Baltic. It\r\nconstituted the domain of the old Order of Teutonic Knights, permanent\r\ncrusaders whose task had been to spread the faith and civilisation of\r\ntheir fatherland among the heathen Slavs. But the Baltic lands had\r\nall submitted to the Cross, and the Knights became in their turn the\r\nobjects of a religious mission. Early in the sixteenth century, the\r\ndoctrines of the Reformation penetrated the minds of their High Master,\r\nAlbert of Hohenzollern. He turned for counsel to Luther himself. In a\r\ncelibate Order which had no more heathen to convert, the husband of the\r\nnun Catherine Bora could see only a standing defiance of the laws of\r\nnature and of God. By his advice Ost-Preussen was “secularised,” that\r\nis, taken from the service of religion to form a Hohenzollern estate,\r\nand in time (1618), though still submissive to the suzerainty of\r\nPoland, it was added to the main body of the Electoral dominions. The\r\nHohenzollerns thus became distinguished from the mass of German princes\r\nby ruling territories to which the Empire had never possessed any\r\nclaim. Ost-Preussen was to them on a small scale what England became in\r\n1688 to the House of Orange, or in 1714 to the House of Hanover. Their\r\npolicy acquired a new breadth and a new weight. Hitherto provincial, it\r\nbecame more and more cosmopolitan, and commerce with the Baltic lands\r\nand England began to hint to the lord of Pillau and Memel that his\r\nfuture lay upon the water.\r\n\r\nA makeweight to Ost-Preussen, which would prevent the centre of gravity\r\nof the Hohenzollern lands from shifting eastwards, was found in 1609,\r\nwhen the family inherited Cleves, Mark, and Ravensberg in Western\r\nGermany. This acquisition, made on the very eve of the Thirty Years’\r\nWar, was accompanied in 1613 by the conversion of the Elector, John\r\nSigismund, from the Lutheranism which his grandfather, Joachim II.,\r\nhad established in 1539 to the sterner and more militant creed of\r\nCalvin. This meant that at the very moment when all Germany was taking\r\nup arms for the greatest religious war of modern times, the court and\r\npeople of Brandenburg were hopelessly at variance with one another. A\r\nCalvinist prince ruled a Lutheran people, and the new Elector, George\r\nWilliam (1619–1640), “of Christ-mild memory” but the weakest of his\r\nline, proved to be a puppet in the hands of Schwarzenburg, his Romanist\r\nprime-minister. Under such guidance did Brandenburg, ill-knit and\r\nill-armed, become the battle-ground between Swede and Hapsburg in their\r\nstruggle for faith and empire.\r\n\r\nWhat Brandenburg suffered in the terrible decade 1630–1640, between\r\nthe landing of Gustavus Adolphus in Germany and the accession of the\r\nGreat Elector, can never be fully calculated. The State was rudderless,\r\ndefenceless, and poor; the combatants on both sides brigands, whom\r\nyears of license had habituated to every kind of cruelty. What passed\r\ncould be described by no more patently truthful eye-witness than\r\nAndreas Rittner, the cheery burgomaster of Tangermünde, a little town\r\non the Elbe with a royal history of its own. In his pages may be traced\r\nthe swift descent of the afflicted people through every depth of\r\nmisery down to despair or even annihilation. The invaders—it mattered\r\nlittle whether Swedes or Imperialists—exacted in endless sequence\r\ncontributions, lodging, forage, and loot, drove off the cattle, broke\r\nup the coffins of the dead, laid waste the land, and hunted down the\r\ninhabitants. The mischief was only increased by the feeble efforts of\r\nthe home government to call out and support a militia. The maddened\r\npeasants turned guerilla. Food failed, for who could sow or reap?\r\nMen fed on carrion, even, it was whispered, on human flesh, and soon\r\npestilence seized on persecutors and persecuted alike.\r\n\r\nAnarchy and degradation brought forth torture. The name of the Swedish\r\nDrink attests the cruelty of the degenerate deliverers of Germany.\r\n“They laid men awhile upon the fire,” writes Rittner,\r\n\r\n    “baked them in ovens, flung them into wells, hung them up by\r\n    the feet, fastened thumb-screws upon them, drove sharp spikes\r\n    under their nails, bound round their heads so tight that\r\n    their eyes started out, gagged them and sealed their mouths.\r\n    Matrons and virgins were oft-times put to shame. Husbands must\r\n    often leave their wives and wives their husbands, parents\r\n    their children and children their parents, even on the bed of\r\n    sickness, for they were powerless to save them from abuse, and\r\n    sometimes when they came back they found nought of them save\r\n    some few bones, for all else had the dogs mangled and eaten up.”\r\n\r\nNot less graphic is the story told in stone in some of the tormented\r\ncities. Round the giant church, spared by the Swedes to uphold the\r\nLutheran faith of which it was then the temple and by the Imperialists\r\nfor the sake of the Roman faith which they hoped to establish anew\r\nwithin its walls, there may be seen the tombs of many generations\r\nof citizens. Those of the sixteenth century are covered with quaint\r\nadornment and graven with artistic skill. Then, as war sweeps over\r\nthe land, the series is broken, to be resumed after many decades\r\nwith a rude clumsiness which shows that wealth and art had fled from\r\nBrandenburg together.\r\n\r\nThough it would be rash to assume that any single part of the Mark may\r\nbe regarded as typical of the whole, there seems to be no reason to\r\ncall in question the dictum of Frederick the Great, that his ancestors\r\nneeded a century to repair the damage of the Thirty Years’ War. This\r\ngreat task was confided to a youth of twenty years, an only son, yet no\r\nfavourite of his father, the Elector George William, whom he succeeded\r\nin 1640. Frederick William, known to history as the Great Elector,\r\nwas the great-grandfather of Frederick the Great. By common consent\r\nhe is reputed the founder of the glory of the House of Hohenzollern\r\nin modern times. He found Brandenburg prostrate and threatened with\r\ndissolution. It is from the low-water mark of these earliest years,\r\nwhen he with reason bewailed difficulties greater than those of David\r\nor Solomon, that the progress of his State is to be measured and his\r\nown achievement thereby understood.\r\n\r\nHe found his exchequer empty, his palace half-ruined, the court seeking\r\nsafety and even sustenance at far-off Königsberg, the Austrian papist,\r\nSchwarzenburg, supreme in the state, the Mark trampled underfoot by\r\nalien hosts. How should an open country like his, the highroad between\r\nSweden and Austria, be delivered from the endless war? Even if, by\r\nmiracle, a peace could be devised, which Calvinists and Lutherans\r\ncould both accept, what prospect, nay what possibility existed that\r\nterritories so ill-compacted as his could be welded into a single,\r\nsolid state? All the needful bonds of union seemed to be lacking. What\r\ncommon tie of blood, of faith, of speech was there strong enough to\r\nbind together Cleves and Brandenburg and Ost-Preussen, units gathered\r\nby the chance of recent history into one hand but dissevered by\r\nhundreds of miles of alien soil and by chasms of sentiment still harder\r\nto bridge over? The constituent parts of Frederick William’s domain\r\nwere in 1640 dissimilar in race, in history, and in interest. They had\r\nno desire for closer relations; they had not even a uniform calendar;\r\ntheir only common political aim seemed to be to flout the Elector, who\r\nwas the bugbear of them all.\r\n\r\nEven were he to make himself master of the centre, dangers clustered\r\nthick on either wing, while behind the Polish problems of the East and\r\nthe Netherlandish problems of the West a seer might have discerned the\r\ndouble peril that encompasses modern Germany. Peter the Great and his\r\nRussia lay yet in the womb of time, but Richelieu and his France were\r\nin the full flood of successful ambition. Thus the organiser of a\r\nNorth German power must work while his horizon was already darkening.\r\nIn grasping the lands which formed his birthright the Great Elector was\r\ndefying, though as yet he knew it not, two of the greatest forces of\r\nmodern times. Hohenzollern rule on the Niemen was to become a challenge\r\nto Russia and to the Slavic advance, while the Hohenzollern lord of\r\nCleves must ultimately reckon with the belief of Frenchmen that the\r\nRhine is the boundary designed by nature for their state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK THE GREAT.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PAINTING BY CHRISTIAN WOLFFGANG.]\r\n\r\nDuring the first critical years of his rule, however, the plans of\r\nthe Great Elector were of the humblest. Striving for existence rather\r\nthan for empire, he was not too proud to beg for help in every likely\r\nquarter. Among our own State-papers are to be seen his letters suing\r\nfor petty favours which Charles I., so long as diplomacy would serve,\r\nwas very willing to grant. The King of England marked the small esteem\r\nin which he held the untried and obscure Elector by pressing upon him\r\nthe hand of his niece, a princess of the fugitive and bankrupt House of\r\nthe Palatinate. Frederick William’s relations with Poland, the suzerain\r\nof whom he held Ost-Preussen, show yet more clearly how slight was his\r\npower at his accession. When the Lutherans of Königsberg threatened\r\nriot because a Calvinist was chosen to preach the funeral sermon of\r\nGeorge William, the Elector did not blush to solicit the Papist King,\r\nWladislaus IV., to admonish these unruly Protestants. To this end he\r\nbade his minister at Warsaw “make humble request to His Majesty\r\nthat His Majesty would in friendly—cousinly fashion let it please\r\nhim to send a letter to our chief Councillors (but as if His Majesty\r\nhad been informed of this from other quarters and not from us) and\r\nthereby to order them to reprove and repress this folly of the unquiet\r\ntheologians.... It will perhaps be best if you solicit this work only\r\nafter the departure of the Diet.” The request was made and granted, and\r\nthe minister instructs the Elector how he may palm off the document as\r\na mandate approved by the Diet behind whose backs it had been obtained.\r\n\r\nWhere charity was to be looked for, Frederick William was not too proud\r\nto beg. But of all powers the least likely to be charitable was Sweden,\r\nwhose armies had for nearly ten years been fighting solely for material\r\ncompensation. To Sweden therefore the Elector offered money and was\r\nallowed to purchase that deliverance from the war which was essential\r\nto all his plans (1641). He could now begin the task of his life—to\r\nreduce all his provinces into dependence upon himself and to render\r\nBrandenburg, augmented and centralised, a formidable military power.\r\n\r\nDuring forty-eight years (1640–1688) he pursued the old Hohenzollern\r\npolicy of family aggrandisement. His success has earned him the title\r\nof the Great Elector, and the place of the first hero of the Prussian\r\nstate. Yet he is remarkable chiefly for his commercial instinct,\r\nimbibed perhaps during his education among the Dutch, the neighbours to\r\nwhom he always looked for example and alliance. On occasion he could\r\ndisplay the soldierly instinct of his race, but in time of peace he was\r\nhardly a heroic figure. With domestic virtues specially to be praised\r\nin a monarch of that time he combined a weakness for strong drink which\r\ndamaged his health and temper. He took pride in being abreast of the\r\ntimes, reverenced London and Amsterdam, and was ready to haggle with\r\nforeigners for preferential rates. He wrote a good commercial hand,\r\nplanted cabbages in his garden, and hammered out verses which with a\r\nlittle doctoring might have graced the poet’s corner of a provincial\r\nnewspaper. He was a thrifty householder, save when he deemed it\r\nnecessary to keep up his position by building a massive palace or\r\ngiving a pompous feast. A convinced Protestant, he welcomed serviceable\r\nHuguenots to his capital with more good-will than serviceable papists.\r\nIt is not impossible to believe that as a German patriot he took\r\nfavours from the Emperor with more inward pleasure than from Louis XIV.\r\nIn what Dr. Prothero terms “the ocean of recognised mendacity which\r\nwe call diplomacy” he floundered without either repugnance or great\r\nsuccess. He spent his life in unifying his dominions and made a will\r\nwhich if carried into effect would have dismembered them at his death.\r\nThat a man of this stamp is designated Great suggests that he was not\r\nonly diligent but that he was also fortunate in the conditions under\r\nwhich he lived and worked.\r\n\r\nIn his early years he owed much to the weakness and insignificance\r\nwhich have already been described. What rival state was thrown into the\r\nshade if Brandenburg was allowed to grow? Thus, at the close of the\r\nThirty Years’ War, the Hohenzollern line received indulgent treatment.\r\nTheir claim to Pomerania was admitted for the eastern half of the\r\nduchy. The western half was indispensable to Sweden, but the rights of\r\nthe Elector were bought up at the price of more valuable ecclesiastical\r\nlands scattered between the Mark and his possessions in the West. The\r\nbishoprics of Halberstadt and Minden and the reversion of the rich\r\narchbishopric of Magdeburg were given to Brandenburg, whose part in\r\nthe war had been contemptible, by the great Peace of Westphalia, the\r\nfundamental pact of modern Europe. Yet its sacredness was so little\r\nappreciated by the Elector that a few years later he would have renewed\r\nthe war, had not outraged Germany held him in.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Westphalia had bestowed upon Brandenburg and other\r\nGerman states a gift of more value than many bishoprics—the gift of\r\nindependence. In outward show Frederick William was still a vassal of\r\nthe Emperor. He continued to be one of the seven Electors who chose\r\nthe head of the Holy Roman Empire and honoured him with lowly homage.\r\nIn virtue of his hereditary office of Grand Chamberlain it was the\r\nduty of the Elector of Brandenburg, prescribed by the Golden Bull of\r\n1356, to appear at solemn courts “on horseback, having in his hands a\r\nsilver basin with water, and a beautiful towel, and descending from his\r\nhorse, to present the water to the Emperor or King of the Romans to\r\nwash his hands.” As a German prince, moreover, he had still to look\r\nto the Emperor for investiture, leadership, and advice. But his right\r\nto determine the creed of his subjects, which the Peace of Westphalia\r\nconfirmed, and the right to choose allies outside the Empire, which it\r\nexpressly granted, were inconsistent with real vassalage. The gift of\r\nthese admitted Brandenburg to a place in the commonwealth of nations.\r\nThe Elector had become undisputed master in his own house. Soon his\r\nhorizon expanded far beyond the bounds of Germany. Europe, nay more,\r\nas his colonial ventures were to prove, the wide world lay open to the\r\nHohenzollern. Both at home and abroad he could strike with a freer\r\nhand. But his power, though irresistible in Brandenburg, was made\r\nrespectable in Europe only by years of toil. Hence the home policy of\r\nthe Great Elector was as straightforward as his foreign policy was\r\ntortuous. To beat down all competing authority, to establish an armed\r\nautocracy, to develop to the utmost all the resources of the State—such\r\nwas the plan which the Great Elector designed, which his son and\r\ngrandson perfected, and the fruits of which Frederick the Great enjoyed.\r\n\r\nBy steady pressure, by force, and at times by fraud, the Great Elector\r\nguarded the future of the Hohenzollern power against the danger\r\nof obstructive provincial parliaments. To make the men of Cleves,\r\nBrandenburg, and Ost-Preussen feel themselves brethren was indeed\r\nbeyond his power. But he ruthlessly suppressed the institutions which\r\nsymbolised their mutual independence of each other and of himself.\r\nCarlyle, the great panegyrist of _coups d’état_, thus describes one\r\nexample of\r\n\r\n    “his measures, soft but strong, and ever stronger to the\r\n    needful pitch, with mutinous spirits. One Bürgermeister of\r\n    Königsberg, after much stroking on the back, was at length\r\n    seized in open Hall, by Electoral writ,—soldiers having first\r\n    gently barricaded the principal streets, and brought cannon to\r\n    bear upon them. This Bürgermeister, seized in such brief way,\r\n    lay prisoner for life; refusing to ask his liberty, though it\r\n    was thought he might have had it on asking.”\r\n\r\nThe Great Elector’s chief legacy was, however, the Prussian army. The\r\nruler of mere patches of the great northern plain, “a country by nature\r\nthe least defensible of all countries,” he girdled it laboriously with\r\na wall of men. In an age when France alone possessed a large standing\r\narmy, this obscure German prince raised his force from a few garrisons\r\nto a host some twenty-seven thousand strong, well drilled and well\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nThe lord of Brandenburg now became a _condottiere_ of ever-increasing\r\nreputation. His regiments brought security to his dominions and gold\r\nto his exchequer. In every European struggle their aid was welcome.\r\nOn the frozen lagoons by the Baltic and on the shores of Torbay,\r\non the torrid plain of Warsaw, and in the vine-clad valley of the\r\nRhine—everywhere the men of the Mark approved themselves good soldiers\r\nand punctual allies. In 1660 the Great Elector netted his profit from\r\nthe Northern war by receiving Ost-Preussen free from Polish suzerainty.\r\nThe heroic moment of the whole reign came, however, in 1675, when all\r\nthe threads of the Elector’s policy—ambition, vengeance against the\r\nSwedes, military creation, domestic organisation—guided him to the\r\nstricken field of Fehrbellin. While playing his part in the West as a\r\nmember of the coalition against France, he learned that the Swedes,\r\nhis hated neighbours in Pomerania, had been hurled upon his domains by\r\ntheir patron Louis XIV. He straightway turned his back upon the Rhine\r\nand stalked silently across Germany to rescue his helpless people. His\r\ntroops had been beaten by Turenne and exhausted by the long struggle\r\nwith rain and mud. Yet he dared to overrule his generals and to strike\r\nstraight at superior forces trained in the school of Gustavus and\r\nposted with a river in their rear.\r\n\r\nThe bold move succeeded. In a hand-to-hand struggle, amid bogs and\r\ndunes, Brandenburg was saved by its chief. At the crisis of the fight\r\nhe put himself at the head of a wavering squadron, and with one wild\r\ncharge shattered the Swedes and their prestige together. The result of\r\nFehrbellin was that Brandenburg took rank as the first military power\r\nof Northern Europe and that the land had rest for many years.\r\n\r\nFehrbellin forms a conspicuous landmark on the road to Hohenzollern\r\ngreatness, but it is separated by no great interval of time from\r\na double demonstration of the insignificance of Brandenburg when\r\nconfronted with states of the first order. The Emperor flatly refused\r\nto admit the claim of the Elector to portions of Silesia. The King of\r\nFrance dashed from his lips the cup of triumph over the Swedes. In\r\nan age when rivers were of even greater value than at present, the\r\ngreat waterway of Brandenburg was the Oder. Ere she could draw full\r\nprofit from the Oder, Stettin, with its splendid harbourage and strong\r\nstrategic position, must be wrested from alien hands. At Fehrbellin\r\nhope sprang up that the time was come. With all the tenacity of his\r\nnature the Great Elector clung to the task. In 1677 Stettin fell, after\r\nenduring one of the most desolating bombardments in history. Before the\r\nclose of 1678 the Swedes were driven from all Western Pomerania. They\r\ndescended upon Ost-Preussen, but Frederick William set at naught the\r\nwinter cold and his own infirmity, hurried from Cleves to the Vistula,\r\nput his troops on sledges, and dashed at the enemy across the frozen\r\nsea (January, 1679). The triumph of the Elector was complete, but at\r\nthe Peace of S. Germain (1679) he was compelled to surrender all his\r\nconquests at the behest of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nIn spite of some failures, however, Frederick William by dogged\r\nperseverance accomplished enough to justify his reputation as the\r\nfounder of the Prussian State. He is still a force in Germany.\r\nFrederick the Great and all the later Hohenzollerns of renown have paid\r\nhomage to his memory. William II. embittered the downfall of Bismarck\r\nby applauding a drama which represented the Great Elector deposing\r\nSchwarzenburg, the hated counsellor of his father. Throughout Prussia\r\nthe imperious features of the little hero of Fehrbellin are as familiar\r\nto the people as his deeds.\r\n\r\nWith the death of the Great Elector in 1688 the age of iron gave way\r\nto the age of tinsel. Frederick, who ruled in his father’s place for a\r\nquarter of a century (1688–1713), was a prince who prized culture above\r\ncharacter and strove to imitate in his provincial court the splendours\r\nof Versailles. From time to time, though less often than in other royal\r\nlines, the business instinct of the Hohenzollerns fails, and of such a\r\nlapse Frederick is an example. Despising the domestic labours of the\r\nGreat Elector, he was captivated by those ceremonious shadows which\r\nthe German nation is always wont to pursue. Frail, even maimed, since\r\nchildhood, he developed a passion for pageants, robes, and titles. He\r\ncould not endure the promotion of his equals to rank higher than his\r\nown. If the Dutch Statthalter rose to be William III. of England and\r\nthe Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be Elector George of Hanover, might\r\nnot he himself, as master of the best troops in Germany, also claim\r\nto rise? When in 1696 he was about to visit William of Orange at the\r\nHague he declared that he could not consent to sit upon an ordinary\r\nseat while an armchair was placed for the King. The interview therefore\r\nwas accomplished standing, and when William returned the visit he found\r\narmchairs of equal dignity set for the Elector and for himself.\r\n\r\nSeldom has a ruler’s weakness done better service to his State.\r\nBrandenburg was shielded by its poverty from the ordinary fate of\r\nGerman states whose rulers tried to copy the profusion of the kings of\r\nFrance. Frederick, moreover, had not the force of will to break with\r\nall the traditions of the Great Elector. He continued to take part\r\nin every struggle as an auxiliary, but in none as a principal. His\r\ncountry thus enjoyed the glories of war without its penalties. It was\r\nunder the command of Prince Eugene, Austria’s greatest general, that\r\nBrandenburgers helped to overthrow the French before Turin (1706). And\r\nsince a large army is the most splendid trapping of monarchy, Frederick\r\nmade his army very large. He inherited 27,000 men, he bequeathed nearly\r\n50,000 to his son.\r\n\r\nThe climax of his reign was reached in 1701, when he prevailed upon\r\nthe Emperor to make him King of Prussia. In a double sense it may be\r\nsaid with truth that he owed his crown to his weakness. It is generally\r\nbelieved that the chief motive which prompted him to sue for it was\r\nvanity. For months he could think and speak of nothing else. When at\r\nlast the imperial license came, the enraptured Elector quitted Berlin\r\nin midwinter and spent twelve days in moving with a pompous train to\r\nKönigsberg. There, with every detail of ceremony that his imagination\r\ncould suggest, he placed the crown upon his head. It is doubtful\r\nwhether a more sober ruler would have prized a throne as he did, and\r\ndoubtful too whether the Emperor would have consented to the elevation\r\nof a prince less obviously feeble. But Frederick had carried on without\r\nreserve the old Hohenzollern tradition of standing well with the head\r\nof the German world. He had even given back to Austria the territory\r\nof Schwiebus, which the Emperor had assigned to the Great Elector in\r\nsettlement of whatever claim the Hohenzollerns possessed to portions\r\nof Silesia. Now he was prepared to uphold the Hapsburg cause in the War\r\nof the Spanish Succession. What harm could there be, the Emperor may\r\nwell have asked himself, in promoting a vassal so devoted as this?\r\n\r\nForty years later, Austria had bitter cause to rue the error of her\r\nchief. From the very first the crown aggrandised the Hohenzollern\r\ndynasty. It consecrated their ambition, enlarged their horizon, and\r\ngave them, as the Lord’s anointed, a new claim upon the devotion of\r\ntheir subjects. The Order of the Black Eagle, which for two centuries\r\nhas been the coveted prize of service to their state, signalised the\r\ncoronation of Frederick I.\r\n\r\nThe Great Elector and the first king of Prussia have this in\r\ncommon—that whatever may be thought of their achievements it is\r\ndifficult to mistake the men themselves. Of the second king, Frederick\r\nWilliam I. (1713–1740), the father of Frederick the Great, the exact\r\nopposite is true. His life-work, the establishment of the royal power\r\n“like a rock of bronze,” is patent to all. He himself, on the other\r\nhand, was a mystery to his own children. His most gifted admirer,\r\nCarlyle, sets out to paint a prophet and ends by portraying something\r\nvery like a madman. His theory of his own sovereign office was as\r\nmystical as his practice of ruling was simple. He regarded himself,\r\nit has been said, as the servant of an imaginary master—the King of\r\nPrussia—under whose eye he lived and worked. Baser princes looked on\r\ntheir royalty as a privilege to be enjoyed. To Frederick William\r\nit was a duty calling for endless toil. He struggled to check every\r\ndetail of government with his own hand, as though Prussia were a single\r\nmanor and he the squire. A French critic (Lavisse) thus portrays him\r\nwrestling with his ever-multiplying tasks:\r\n\r\n    “Have we not too many officials,” the King enquires. “Could\r\n    not several places be merged into one? We must see if some of\r\n    the officials cannot be put down. Why is not the beer so good\r\n    everywhere as at Potsdam? In order to have wool we must have\r\n    sheep. Now in Prussia there are nearly as many wolves as sheep.\r\n    Quick, let me have a minute upon the destruction of wolves.\r\n    How comes it that the salt tax has brought in less money this\r\n    year than last from the district of Halberstadt? The number of\r\n    officials has not diminished, has it? They must have eaten as\r\n    much salt as last year. There must therefore be fraud or waste\r\n    somewhere. The Superintendent of the Salt Department must be\r\n    warned to manage matters better than he has done of late. Can\r\n    it be that my subjects buy salt in Hanover or Poland? Every\r\n    importer of salt must be hanged.”\r\n\r\nHis violence was and still is notorious. He flung plates at his\r\nchildren, caned his son in public, cudgelled the inhabitants of his\r\ncapital, and flung the judges down-stairs. He forced his queen, the\r\nsister of the English King, to drink to the downfall of England. He\r\nvilified everything French, and insulted the British Ambassador so\r\nseriously that he conceived himself bound to leave Berlin. Yet he kept\r\nPrussia at peace steadily enough to earn for himself the reputation of\r\na mere bully whom the Emperor could lead by the nose.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the contradictions of his character, however, the broad\r\nprinciples of his reign are clear. Having stripped the state of the\r\nveneer of luxury with which Frederick I. had disguised its poverty,\r\nhe took up and developed further the ideals of the Great Elector. He\r\nmade the royal power absolute in the state, and increased the army\r\ntill a population of about two and a half million souls supported\r\nthe unheard-of number of 83,000 men under arms. These were drilled\r\nto such a pitch of perfection that Macaulay could say that, placed\r\nbeside them, the household regiments of Versailles and St. James’s\r\nwould have appeared an awkward squad. Yet this mighty force was used\r\nfor little save to secure the frontiers of Prussia and the rights of\r\nall German Protestants. In territory the “Sergeant King” gained only\r\nfrom the wreck of Sweden part of the prize which the Great Elector\r\nhad grudgingly relinquished at the behest of Louis XIV.—the mouth of\r\nthe Oder and with it the islands of Usedom and Wollin, and Western\r\nPomerania as far as the river Peene (1720).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUSSIA\r\n\r\nAfter the Congress of Vienna, 1815]\r\n\r\nIn the home department, on the other hand, Frederick William I. made\r\na conspicuous advance from the point reached by his grandfather. He\r\nshowed the same military zeal, the same practical insight, the same\r\ndetermination to set to rights with his own hand whatever in his\r\ndominion was governed amiss, the same contempt for higher education,\r\nthe same benevolence towards the persecuted of other lands who might be\r\nmade useful to Prussia. But he showed also a power of grasping and of\r\nsimplifying the whole system of administration such as few rulers\r\nhave ever possessed. His great Edict of 1723 removed friction from the\r\nworking of the Prussian state. Thanks to this, his son Frederick found\r\nthe organisation described in the sixth chapter of this book—a machine\r\nof government answering to every touch of the royal hand. He found at\r\nthe same time a firm tradition in favour of thrift, diligence, and\r\nactivity in the steersman of the state. We have traced the growth of\r\nPrussia to 1740; let us now turn to the story of the prince who in that\r\nyear linked her fortunes with his own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFREDERICK AS CROWN PRINCE, 1712–1740\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat manner of man was the first-born son of Frederick William,\r\nknown to history as Frederick the Great, and what were the causes\r\nthat made him such as he was? To answer either question is a task of\r\nuncommon difficulty. Even to those who were regarded as his intimates\r\nFrederick remained an enigma all his life. In his early trials he\r\nacquired, as Carlyle happily expresses it, “the art of wearing among\r\nhis fellow-creatures a polite cloak-of-darkness,” and became what he\r\nin great measure still remains, “a man politely impregnable to the\r\nintrusion of human curiosity.” And if it passes our wit adequately\r\nto describe his personality, how shall we determine and distinguish\r\nthe factors which created it? No adding together of influences\r\nwill suffice. Such enquiries lead us far beyond the bounds of mere\r\narithmetic. Of Frederick’s nature, as of every man’s, a greater share\r\nwas built up in ages which have left no record than in the generations\r\nwhose history we can trace. If therefore we next endeavour to indicate\r\nthe influences of his parentage and his surroundings, let us avoid the\r\ndelusion that these alone made him what he was. In Frederick’s case,\r\ntoo, it is perhaps equally needful to beware of the converse error. His\r\npersonality, like his policy, was not untouched by ordinary influences.\r\nParents, tutors, friends, nation, home, even religion—each bestowed\r\nsomething upon one who might on a too hasty scrutiny be pronounced a\r\nfreak of nature—the ugly duckling of the Hohenzollern brood.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s birth, on January 24, 1712, remedied the anxieties of a\r\nline which had gained too much from the extinction of allied lines not\r\nto be keenly sensitive to its own lack of heirs. His father, Frederick\r\nWilliam, gave vent to rude transports of joy at the arrival of a male\r\nheir. Frederick I., the royal grandfather, who had himself a third time\r\nplunged into wedlock in the hope of safeguarding the succession to\r\nthe new Prussian crown, seized the opportunity to astonish Berlin by\r\nthe pomp of the infant’s christening. The Prussian nation, living in\r\ntranquillity under the Hohenzollerns, shared in their rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThe infant prince represented many noble lines, and, it might almost\r\nbe said, two separate civilisations. Frederick William was a kind of\r\nPrussian Squire Western. His wife, Sophia Dorothea, was a princess of\r\nthe rising House of Hanover, a lady soon to be nicknamed Olympia from\r\nher majestic bearing as queen. Through her and through his grandmother,\r\na clever daughter of Sophia of Hanover, a thin strain of Stuart blood\r\nflowed in Frederick’s veins. His great-grandmother, the wife of the\r\nGreat Elector, was a daughter of the House of Orange, born at the\r\nmoment of its triumph over Spain. A generation farther back the\r\nHohenzollerns had married into the House of the Palatinate, which in\r\n1618 threw for the Bohemian crown and lost. But the virtues of every\r\nProtestant House in Europe could not compensate for the infirm health\r\nwhich had assailed both the father and the son of the Great Elector,\r\nand which there seemed reason to fear had descended to the offspring of\r\nhis grandson Frederick William. Two older sons had died in infancy, a\r\ndaughter, Wilhelmina, though she grew up and married, was never robust,\r\nand Frederick himself seems in his childhood to have been often ailing.\r\n\r\nThe home circle of this delicate prince was surely the strangest in the\r\nworld. The royal family of Prussia in the reign of Frederick William\r\nI. was hardly a family and hardly royal. The monarch seemed to regard\r\nhis sceptre chiefly as a superior kind of cudgel. As Prussian King, and\r\ntherefore _ex officio_ the father of his people, he could treat them\r\nas children, could order them to be anything or to build anything or\r\nto pay anything, with even less risk of resistance than an Elector of\r\nBrandenburg might have had to fear. He was, it is true, on a footing\r\nof equality with foreign kings in negotiating for a treaty or a\r\nprovince or a bride. But apart from his acceptance of the perquisites\r\nof royalty, his life was one long protest against all that the world\r\nassociated with the name of king. Intolerant of state and ceremony, he\r\nagonised his chamberlains by his behaviour. His recreations were such\r\nas befitted a bargeman on the Havel or an overgrown loafer kidnapped to\r\nserve in the King of Prussia’s giant grenadiers. In that snuff-taking\r\nage, a king whose hobby was to smoke pipes in a kind of glorified\r\ntavern-circle known as the Tobacco Parliament earned the reputation\r\nthat would fall in our own day to a king who should chew and spit.\r\n\r\nFrederick William drank himself to death before he was fifty-two.\r\nThough an artist, if not a scholar, he drove Wolf, the philosopher,\r\nfrom his dominions and made Gundling President of the Academy of\r\nLetters because he amused the Tobacco Parliament when in his cups. As a\r\nsportsman he slew wild swine by the thousand and forced his subjects to\r\nbuy their carcasses at a fixed price. He ordered his officials to spend\r\nonly six thousand thalers on the entertainment of Peter the Great, but\r\nto give out that it cost him thirty or forty thousand. His mixture of\r\nfervent piety and immorality suggests that he was hardly sane, and his\r\nforeign policy does not discountenance the suggestion. In some of his\r\nofficials he placed complete confidence, even when proofs that they\r\nwere bribing his envoys abroad to send home false news were in his\r\nhands. He rushed upon others with his cudgel, first breaking their\r\nheads and then cashiering them. What he was to his children may be\r\ninferred from the fact that his daughter became his bitter satirist and\r\nhis son his bitter foe.\r\n\r\nSuch was the father who directed Frederick’s education. His talent for\r\ndetail was always at the service of the state. It could be devoted to\r\nno worthier object than the training of the future king. At the age of\r\nnine years, therefore, Frederick found every hour of the day assigned\r\nto some part of the scheme of education by which the crowned Podsnap\r\ndesigned to make him such another as himself.\r\n\r\nFor all its minuteness, the scheme failed in its main object. It\r\nfailed because Frederick William was not the sole factor in moulding\r\nand inspiring his son. In the royal household were two trembling\r\nconspirators against the tyrant—his wife and his daughter. Sophia\r\nDorothea and Wilhelmina formed with Frederick a trio who sighed after\r\nthe genteel. Loathing the pipe-clayed Teutonism in which their lord\r\ndelighted, they longed for newer fashions and society more polite, for\r\nthe wit and gallantry of the French court, and for the splendour of\r\ntheir own opulent kinsfolk at Saint James’s. Their lines had fallen in\r\nfar less pleasant places. In Berlin, a quiet country town with dull\r\nsurroundings and a trying climate, they had at least palaces, parties,\r\nand scandal. In Wusterhausen, to this day a lonely village, they were\r\nin exile; and Wusterhausen was the favourite residence of the King. The\r\nEurope in which they lived, it must be remembered, was a Europe which\r\nbelieved with all its heart that whatever Louis XIV. might have been\r\nin politics, he was beyond doubt the Apollo of culture. German princes\r\nprided themselves on speaking French, on dressing _à la française_,\r\non building palaces that might be named in the same breath with\r\nVersailles. Frederick’s mother spoke French so well that a Huguenot\r\nrefugee paid her the supreme compliment of enquiring whether she\r\nunderstood German. His sister’s memoirs, like his own, are French in\r\nlanguage and in inspiration. What sympathy, we may wonder, could there\r\nbe between these ladies and a boor who hated everything French, whether\r\nlanguage, literature, art, cookery, or dress, and whose ideal of life\r\nwas to sleep on straw in a barn, wash at daybreak in a tub, don a plain\r\nuniform, inspect farms, account-books, and soldiers, gorge himself with\r\nrude German dishes in the middle of the day, snore under a tree in the\r\nafternoon, and devote the evening to tobacco, buffoonery, and strong\r\ndrink?\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that, when the King’s scheme of discipline\r\noutraged his son instead of moulding him, mother and sister were\r\nat hand with ready sympathy. The wayward boy never forgot their\r\nkindness, nor the indulgence of the tutors who connived at a more\r\nhumane education than Frederick William had commanded them to inflict.\r\nCordially as the King detested French culture, he did not venture to\r\nexclude it from a leading part in the education of his son. A French\r\nlady, Madame de Roucoulle, was entrusted with the oversight of his\r\nearliest years. Madame de Camas, whom he called Mamma, was the wife of\r\na Frenchman. His tutor, Duhan, was a Huguenot. French was at that time\r\nthe universal language of the polite and learned world. Frederick, who\r\nnever learned English and was forbidden to learn Latin, therefore drew\r\nall his mental supplies from French originals or French translations.\r\n\r\nGerman he never spoke or wrote with ease. To him it stood for whatever\r\nwas dull in his education,—for windy sermons every Sunday, lessons\r\nof nearly two hours a day in the Christian religion, books full of\r\ndismal pedantry, the speech of boors and of his father. Thus he early\r\nacquired from France ideas which he proclaimed throughout his life.\r\nThat literary creation is the highest achievement of man, and that next\r\nto creation stand patronage and culture; that religion is superstition;\r\nthat the enlightened man is he who views with calm not only the rubs of\r\nfortune but also the frailties of mankind—such were the abiding traces\r\nof Frederick’s education. The King, as may readily be believed, did not\r\nfail to remark something of this and to loathe it. He leaped to the\r\nconclusion that a boy who preferred French to German, and flute-playing\r\nto parades, was a monster who would ruin Prussia. It never occurred to\r\nhim that his own scheme could be imperfect, and life became one long\r\ncollision between father and son.\r\n\r\nYet Frederick’s most irritating delinquencies—his delight in soft\r\nliving and secret dissipation, his distaste for the uniform and duty\r\nof a soldier, his contempt for Germans and their tongue—may fairly\r\nbe ascribed in great part to mere youthful squeamishness and to the\r\ntyranny of the King. Had Frederick William been wise enough to trust\r\nto the future and to the past, to reflect that in the long line of\r\nHohenzollerns none had been traitor to his House, that a lad who could\r\nthink for himself would be more easily influenced than coerced, that\r\nat the worst he himself was not twenty-four years older than his son\r\nand might train the state to survive Frederick II. as after the Great\r\nElector it had survived Frederick I.—had he in short been either a\r\nsympathetic father or a man of real penetration, then history might\r\nhave heard nothing of either the new Junius Brutus or the Ogre of\r\nPotsdam, and the million victims of Frederick’s wars might have been\r\nspared.\r\n\r\nUnhappily for his son and for the world, Frederick William was neither\r\nsensible nor sympathetic. His aversion to an heir who refused to\r\nresemble himself was doubled when the heir became the advocate of a\r\nmatrimonial policy which he came to regard with loathing. From the hour\r\nof Frederick’s birth the dearest wish of the Hanoverian House, and of\r\nSophia Dorothea most of all, had been to unite more closely the royal\r\nlines of England and Prussia. At length a double marriage was proposed.\r\nThe Prince of Wales was to marry Wilhelmina, and Frederick his cousin\r\nAmelia, daughter of George II. In 1730, however, England and Prussia\r\nwere estranged, yet Frederick William knew that his household had not\r\ngiven up their darling project. Flouted as a father and as a statesman,\r\nhe treated his son so ill as to lend colour to the suspicion that he\r\nwished him dead. Not content with impounding his books, forbidding him\r\nthe flute, compelling him to see his mother only by stealth, the tyrant\r\nactually rained blows upon him in public, even in the camp of the\r\nSaxon King. “Had I been so treated by my father,” he is said to have\r\nexclaimed, “I would have blown my brains out, but this fellow has no\r\nhonour.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Frederick William, the youth whom he thus outraged\r\nwas Crown Prince of Prussia, and as such by no means lacked friends.\r\nTo England, to Austria, and to his father’s ministers he was an\r\nimportant pawn in the game of politics. Some of the younger officers\r\nlent him countenance in the hope of favours to come. But the dearest\r\nfriend of his life, Lieutenant von Katte, loved him for himself rather\r\nthan for what he might be able to bestow. To Katte the prince confided\r\nhis fixed purpose to flee from a tyranny that was past endurance.\r\nTogether they planned to make use of the opportunity of escape which\r\nmight arise when Frederick should approach the French frontier in the\r\ncourse of a forthcoming tour with his father among the German courts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCESS SOPHIA DOROTHEA, DAUGHTER OF KING GEORGE THE\r\nFIRST.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PAINTING BY HIRSEMAN.]\r\n\r\nOn August 4, 1730, the attempt was made. The confederates tried to\r\nsteal from the royal camp at dawn and to ride into France. Such a\r\nflight was not without precedent in Hohenzollern history. Frederick’s\r\ngrandfather, sharing the general belief that his stepmother had\r\npoisoned his brother and meant to poison himself, had first sought\r\nshelter at Cassel with his aunt and at a later date had quitted the\r\nGreat Elector’s court altogether. But for the heir to a crown to flee\r\nbeyond the bounds of Germany was a still graver step. The youth of\r\neighteen had hardly calculated the probable consequences of success.\r\nWhere was Frederick William’s heir to find a safe asylum? Louis XV. was\r\nnot likely to be to him what Louis XIV. had been to the Old Pretender.\r\nGeorge of England would hardly expose Hanover to the vengeance of\r\nthe King of Prussia. His envoy had in fact refused to countenance\r\nthe scheme. Nor would the Emperor care to sacrifice the Prussian\r\nalliance to mere sentiment. Even if Frederick should succeed in finding\r\na refuge for himself, he would none the less have left two dear\r\nhostages at the mercy of the King. “Your mother would have got into the\r\ngreatest misery,” declared Frederick William a year later. “Your sister\r\nI would have cast for life into a place where she would never have seen\r\nsun and moon again.”\r\n\r\nThanks, however, to the vigilance of Colonel von Rochow, his keeper,\r\nand to the panic of his page, Frederick did not even mount the horse\r\nthat was to have borne him out of Germany. His abortive attempt\r\ninaugurated one of the strangest tragedies in history. From the very\r\nfact that he was the guest of other princes Frederick William could not\r\nact in haste. The scheme was betrayed to him at Mannheim on August 6th,\r\nand he ordered von Rochow to deliver his son to him at his own town of\r\nWesel, alive or dead. In this mood they continued the tour of pleasure,\r\nsailing down the Rhine and visiting the potentates upon its shores. At\r\nlast, on the evening of the 12th, they reached Wesel. Frederick William\r\nat once interrogated his son, who lied and protested his submission.\r\nThe King replied by despatching him to Spandau under the care of a\r\ngeneral, who was enjoined to frustrate any attempt at rescue by killing\r\nhis prisoner.\r\n\r\nSpandau is the fortress near Berlin where to-day the Prussian sentries\r\nguard some millions of the treasure wrung from France. It was not\r\ndeemed safe enough to keep the Prince of Prussia. “He is very cunning,”\r\nwrote the King, “and will have a hundred inventions for making his\r\nescape.” A stronger gaol was sought for. In a sombre plain east of\r\nthe capital lies Cüstrin, whose grim fortress marks the spot where\r\nthe sluggish Wartha gliding down from Poland silently joins the Oder.\r\nThere, on September 4th, Frederick was imprisoned. On the way he had\r\nfaced a tribunal of soldiers and lawyers with a jaunty confidence which\r\nshowed that though he might cower before the King he had not forgotten\r\nthat he was still Crown Prince of Prussia. It was rumoured that he\r\nhad poked fun at Grumbkow, his father’s most trusted counsellor. For\r\nhimself he asked no favours, but avowed his responsibility for all that\r\nKatte had done amiss.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, on September 16th, the commission examined him\r\nagain. In the meantime he had begun to understand the nature of a\r\ngaol. His father, who lived in such a state of frenzy that he ordered\r\nthat the tongue which spoke of this affair should be cut out, had\r\nnot scrupled to condemn him to solitary confinement, a penalty often\r\ndestructive of health and not seldom of reason. He was clad in brown\r\nprison dress, fed on the humblest fare, and deprived of light at seven\r\no’clock in the evening. Thus prepared, he was subjected to a merciless\r\ninquisition. After more than one hundred and eighty questions of fact,\r\ncame two which the King had commanded the interrogators to add. “Do\r\nyou wish that your life should be granted to you or not?” “I submit\r\nto the King’s mercy,” answered Frederick, adding in pencil, when the\r\nreport was laid before him, “and to his will.” “Since by violating\r\nyour honour,” ran the last question of all, “you have made yourself\r\nincapable of succeeding to the throne, will you renounce the succession\r\nby an abdication that shall be confirmed by the whole Roman Empire—to\r\nsave your life?” “My life is not over-dear to me,” replied the Prince,\r\n“but Your Majesty would surely not be so ungracious to me”—and he added\r\na prayer for pardon. The King tore up the petition and applied his\r\ngenius for detail to a code of rules for the torment of his heir. No\r\none was to speak to the prisoner. Three times a day the door of his\r\nroom might be opened, but within four minutes it must be made fast\r\nagain. Mute attendants were to set before Frederick food which they\r\nhad cut in pieces, since the royal command deprived him of knife and\r\nfork. For Katte Frederick William had ordered the rack, but on the\r\nrepresentations of Grumbkow the order was cancelled. For his son he\r\ndiscovered a torture which Grumbkow himself was to apply. “He must be\r\ntold,” decreed the King, “that no one thinks of him any more; that my\r\nwife will not hear his name; that his sister Wilhelmina has fallen\r\nunder my displeasure, that she is shut up in Berlin, and will very soon\r\nbe sent into the country.”\r\n\r\nThe problem before Frederick William, whose wrath increased as he\r\nexperienced the difficulty of laying to his son’s account any definite\r\ncrime, was to crush his heir without imperilling Prussia. On October\r\n11th Frederick declared to the commission that he was ready to renounce\r\nthe succession. On October 16th the King avowed in writing his desire\r\nto make his second son his heir. But to do this while Frederick\r\nlived was dangerous, and on what charge could he be put to death?\r\nAssassination, though it might rectify the succession to Philip of\r\nSpain or Peter of Russia, was to a Hohenzollern simply impossible. And\r\nFrederick William was not entirely sovereign over his son. It was true\r\nthat a Prussian subject had no longer any right of appeal from the\r\ndecrees of the Prussian King. But the Prussian King was also Elector\r\nof Brandenburg, and therefore a vassal of the Emperor. The heir to\r\nthe Electorate of Brandenburg was equally a prince of the Empire and\r\nas such could appeal unto Cæsar. Moreover, no proof could be found\r\nthat Frederick was a traitor. He had neither acted nor tried to act in\r\ncollusion with any foreign Power. His father suspected that England was\r\nat the bottom of the plot, but no evidence of this could be found. By\r\nno severity could his son be brought to confess more than a design to\r\nrun away. Foreign sovereigns protested against violence which degraded\r\nthe royal caste.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see with what hope the baffled King insisted on a\r\nquibble which might make out his son to be technically a criminal.\r\nFrederick, by no choice of his own, was a colonel in the Prussian army.\r\nOn October 25th a military court met at the King’s bidding to try him\r\nand his accomplices for desertion.\r\n\r\nThe court consisted of fifteen officers, three from each of five\r\ngrades. The members of each grade, after deliberating apart,\r\nhanded their votes to a president, the aged Lieutenant-Colonel von\r\nSchulenburg, who summed up their verdicts and added a sixth vote of\r\nhis own. With regard to the Crown Prince, all were unanimous. Declaring\r\nthemselves incompetent to pronounce upon affairs of state and of the\r\nroyal family, they commended the exalted penitent to His Majesty’s\r\nsupreme and paternal mercy. Katte was condemned by three grades to\r\ndeath, by two to lifelong imprisonment. Von Schulenburg voted for\r\nthe latter, which by military law carried the day, since it was less\r\nsevere. The King denounced their criminal leniency and clamoured for\r\n“justice,” but von Schulenburg stood firm, appealing to a Higher Power.\r\nThereupon Frederick William decreed “that Katte, although in conformity\r\nwith the laws he has deserved to be torn with red-hot pincers and\r\nhanged for the crime of high-treason which he has committed, be removed\r\nfrom life to eternity by the sword, out of consideration for his\r\nfamily. In informing Katte of this sentence, the Council will tell him\r\nthat it grieves His Majesty, but that it is better that he should die\r\nthan that justice should entirely leave the world.”\r\n\r\nUnder a sentence which no consensus of civilised opinion, no\r\nhigh-placed appeal, no murmur of disaffection could reduce, the doomed\r\nman journeyed slowly to Cüstrin. Frederick, who believed that all\r\nwould go well with himself and his friend, was cheerful still. At five\r\no’clock on the morning of November 6th he was awakened by two officers\r\nwho told him that Katte was that morning to be put to death and that\r\nhe must witness it. “What are these ill tidings that you bring me?”\r\nhe is said to have exclaimed. “Lord Jesus! rather take my life.”\r\nBefore his judges he had steadfastly declared that Katte’s guilt lay\r\nat his door. Now for two terrible hours he wailed, wrung his hands,\r\nburst into tears, sent to his friend to beg forgiveness, prayed for a\r\nrespite while a courier should lay at the King’s feet whatever he might\r\ndesire from his son—renunciation of the succession, consent to lifelong\r\nimprisonment, nay, his own life if Katte’s might be spared. His\r\nhonourable clamour moves the heart of posterity, but it could vary no\r\nline upon the parchment on which the King had set down even the numbers\r\nof the soldiers who were to attend the execution. Seven o’clock struck,\r\nand the dismal procession filed into the courtyard which stretched from\r\nthe fortress-wall to the Oder. As the King had commanded, Frederick was\r\nled to the window of his cell. He saw his friend, who had received the\r\ncommunion, standing calm and brave amid the soldiers and awaiting with\r\nbared head the recital of the sentence of death. The prince kissed his\r\nhand to him and cried aloud for his forgiveness. Katte laid his finger\r\nupon his lips, bowed respectfully, and answered that there was nothing\r\nto forgive. He then bade his comrades farewell, knelt to receive the\r\nchaplain’s blessing, and with prayer upon his lips submitted to the\r\nfatal stroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PAINTING BY CUNNINGHAM.]\r\n\r\nFrederick had fainted. It was the duty of the chaplain to pass straight\r\nfrom the dead offender to the living, and to exhort him to repent.\r\nBut nature made this royal order of none effect. The prince, when he\r\ncame to, could only stare dumbly at the gloomy pall which draped\r\nthe body of his friend. At two o’clock some citizens brought a coffin\r\nand bore away the corpse, but Frederick could not withdraw his gaze\r\nfrom the place of execution. All that day he took no food. At night he\r\npassed from delirium into a second swoon—then fell to raving anew. When\r\nmorning broke he declared that Katte was standing before him. But the\r\nvery violence of his emotion made the reaction swift. On the same day\r\nhe told the doctor that he was well and asked him for a certain powder.\r\nNext day, after much talk with the chaplain on matters of religion, he\r\nlearned from him that Katte’s fate was not to be his own. Nine days\r\nlater he made peace with Grumbkow, who came at the head of yet another\r\nCommission to exact an oath of strict obedience to the King, and to\r\nopen the prison doors a little wider. Before Christmas he was reported\r\nto be “as merry as a lark.”\r\n\r\nThe conduct of father and son during this crisis is peculiarly worthy\r\nof attention because each was his own counsellor, and because Frederick\r\nnever again lay under a scrutiny so searching. In the summer of 1730\r\nthe King reaped all that he had sown during his son’s boyhood. He found\r\nin his heir a youth whom he distrusted and despised but could not get\r\nrid of. He therefore began the task anew and inaugurated a second\r\neducation sterner than the first. He had slain his son’s friend, not,\r\nas he professed, “that justice should not entirely leave the world,”\r\nbut that he might, in spite of past failures, fashion an heir after\r\nhis own heart. The loyal father of the dead man found consolation in\r\nviewing his loss as a sacrifice to this design. That this, which he\r\nbelieved to be indispensable to the welfare of Prussia, was the leading\r\nmotive of the King’s policy, grew clearer as his outbursts of wrath\r\nagainst his son became less frequent and less fierce. It inspired\r\nFrederick also with a leading motive—to beguile his father into\r\nbelieving that he had his way.\r\n\r\nHis first education made him a rebel; his second, a hypocrite. Katte’s\r\ndeath had taught him once and for all that life would be tolerable only\r\nif he gained his father’s confidence. To this end he applied every art\r\nwhich a fertile brain could devise and an unscrupulous actor could\r\npractise. He exhausted the language of contrition for the past. He\r\npromised full amendment for the future. He sent letters, as many as his\r\nfather would consent to receive, and the burden of all was that he was\r\nindeed a new man, a second Frederick William, adoring the things that\r\nhe had burned and burning those that he had adored. The new Frederick\r\nis interested in tall soldiers, his father’s hobby, and longs to put\r\non the uniform which he had been wont to call his winding-sheet. He\r\nrelishes theology and after argument abandons what his father calls\r\n“the damned heresy” of predestination. He professes to find pleasure\r\nin the work of the estates committee and informs his father with\r\necstasy that the rent of some royal domains can be raised. He tries to\r\npropitiate the King of Prussia as Philip of Spain tried to propitiate\r\nthe English people, by pretending to a taste for beer. Even his opinion\r\nof his own family has swiftly changed. He now pretends to realise that\r\nhis mother is a mischievous intriguer; to be content that his sister\r\nshall abjure the throne of England and marry an obscure Hohenzollern\r\nof Baireuth; to desire that his father may live to see his children’s\r\nchildren grow up around him. Finally he receives at the hands of\r\nFrederick William a regiment and a wife and withdraws into the marshy\r\nsolitudes of Brandenburg to make the best of both.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of Frederick’s biographer to mark from Frederick’s\r\npoint of view the stages of this second education. The first period\r\nlasted rather more than two and a half years, from November, 1730,\r\nto June, 1733, and therefore roughly corresponds with the period of\r\nresidence at an English university which is usually enjoyed at the age\r\nat which the Crown Prince had then arrived. This course began and ended\r\nwith a crime. Katte was done to death for a military offence which a\r\ntribunal representing the most sternly disciplined army in the world\r\nhad declared not to be death-worthy—though their commander-in-chief\r\nand king demanded another verdict. A fortnight later, that is, on\r\nNovember 20, 1730, Frederick was admitted as a humble participant in\r\nthe proceedings of the local Chamber of War and Domains—to assist in\r\nduties which he privately styled the work of brigands. He was to study\r\nagriculture under the Director, Hille, and in general to survey the\r\nfoundations of the Prussian State.\r\n\r\nHe was still a close prisoner living at Cüstrin under the heavy cloud\r\nof the King’s displeasure. At Christmas he fell ill and his father\r\nwrote on the margin of a report which told him of it: “If there were\r\nany good in him he would die, but I am certain that he will not die,\r\nfor weeds never disappear.” He was forbidden all books save bible,\r\nhymn-book, and Arndt’s _True Christianity_, a work of devotion dear\r\nto humble believers in many lands. Geometry and fortifications were\r\nclassed as “amusement” and forbidden, along with cards, music, dancing,\r\nsummer-clothing, and meals outside the house. Again, as in the early\r\ndays of August, Frederick William entrusted him to the care of three\r\nnobles. These were to refuse to converse with him on any subject\r\nsave “the Word of God, the constitution of the land, manufactures,\r\npolice, agriculture, accounts, leases, and lawsuits.” Such a scheme\r\nof education, aimed at compounding a king out of a recluse and an\r\nattorney, it is hardly necessary to discuss. We hardly know whether\r\nto think the King a simpleton for imagining that he would be obeyed,\r\nor a fool for continuing to issue minute directions if he knew that\r\nhe would not. What is certain is that Frederick’s household revelled\r\nin forbidden gifts, diverted itself as best it could, and pressed\r\nunceasingly for further freedom. One pleasure, as Frederick William\r\nknew in his heart, sweetened his son’s captivity,—in exile he was at\r\nleast safe from the sight of his father.\r\n\r\nThe first dawn of forgiveness took place on August 15, 1731, the King’s\r\nforty-third birthday. Then Frederick received his father in his shabby\r\nlodging, kissed his feet, listened to his reproaches, confessed once\r\nmore that it was he who had led Katte astray, and finally received\r\nthe royal embrace before all the people. Soon came permission to\r\nengage in the practical study of agriculture, attended by an increase\r\nof liberty and even of amusement. The King still imposed restrictions\r\nupon Frederick’s reading and ordered him to sing hymns. He was never\r\nto be alone or to speak privately to anybody, especially to any girl\r\nor woman. Within a fortnight of his father’s visit he had begun his\r\ncourtship of the young wife of Colonel von Wreech.\r\n\r\nThe remaining months of the year 1731 brought Frederick great pleasure\r\nand a heavy blow. He grew in favour with his father, who in November\r\nsummoned him to appear for a short time at Berlin and at last promised\r\nto restore to him his rank in the army. But at the same time he lost\r\nhis sister. Wilhelmina was forced by her father into an unhappy\r\nmarriage with the Margrave of Baireuth, a humble cousin whose title to\r\nthe favour of his bride was that by accepting him she propitiated her\r\nfather and freed herself from a still less bearable suitor. Elated by\r\nthe progress of his own fortunes, Frederick seems for the moment to\r\nhave been insensible to her trouble and to his own loss. By the King’s\r\norder he paid his sister a visit. But he treated her coldly when they\r\nmet, broke off the conversation abruptly, and walked into the room\r\nto which her husband had courteously withdrawn. “He scanned him for\r\nsome time from head to foot,” writes Wilhelmina, “and after addressing\r\nto him a few words of cold politeness he withdrew.... I could not\r\nrecognise that dear brother who had cost me so many tears and for whom\r\nI had sacrificed myself.” Frederick’s standard of behaviour towards his\r\nsocial inferiors was however revealed by other incidents at this time.\r\nHis tutor, Hille, was a man of the middle classes. In his official\r\nposition he received reports from a Landrat, or Sheriff, who was of\r\nnoble birth. A reference by Hille to these reports drew from the Crown\r\nPrince the remark that it was singular that a nobleman should render\r\naccount to a man of the middle class. Next year he wrote to Grumbkow\r\nthat his daughter was “without charms and without ancestors.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIZABETH CHRISTINA OF BRUNSWICK.\r\n\r\nFROM AN OLD PRINT.]\r\n\r\nIn 1732 Frederick experienced another pleasure and a far severer\r\nblow. He was allowed to leave Cüstrin, but he left it under sentence\r\nof marriage. This had been decreed in consequence of a curious chain\r\nof events. Frederick’s preceptors had remarked that he scorned\r\nadministrative detail but displayed a taste for high politics. This was\r\nevident in his suggestions for the disposal of his hand. Now he would\r\nmarry, if he must marry at all, Anne of Russia; now the Archduchess\r\nMaria Theresa, renouncing his succession in Prussia. This suggestion\r\nwas reported by Grumbkow to the Emperor’s great minister, Eugene.\r\nThe old diplomat scented danger in such large ideas and urged that\r\nthe Crown Prince of Prussia should be bound to the car of Austria.\r\nHe might be encouraged to borrow money from the Emperor, and married\r\nto Elizabeth of Brunswick-Bevern, a niece of the Empress. Frederick\r\nWilliam, still hot against England, with whose Court his queen\r\ncontinued to intrigue, cheerfully assented to the match.\r\n\r\nIn a honeyed letter of February 4, 1732, the King broke the news to\r\nhis son. “She is a creature who fears God,” he wrote, “and that is\r\neverything.” The bridegroom elect thought otherwise. He wrote to\r\nGrumbkow that he hated severe virtue, and rather than marry a fanatic,\r\nalways grimacing and looking shocked, he would prefer the worst\r\ncharacter in Berlin. “When all is said and done he cried, there will be\r\none more unhappy princess in the world.” “I shall put her away as soon\r\nas I am master,” he twice declared. “Am I of the wood out of which they\r\ncarve good husbands?” “I love the fair sex, my love is very inconstant;\r\nI am for enjoyment, afterwards I despise it. I will keep my word, I\r\nwill marry, but that is enough; _Bonjour, Madame, et bon chemin_.”\r\n\r\nFrederick’s marriage, by which he brought to an end the sternest period\r\nof his second education, was a crime, but the bridegroom was not\r\nguiltless. All his outcry was made in secret. To the King, in whose\r\nhands his fate lay, he showed himself all submission. Frederick William\r\nhad in his own young days received the names of three princesses from\r\nwhom his father desired him to choose a bride. He protested with\r\nsuccess against such compulsion and his marriage with Sophia Dorothea\r\nwas something of a love-match. Here was an argument to which he could\r\nhardly shut his ears. His son preferred to purchase greater liberty\r\nfor himself by condemning to a life of misery an innocent creature who\r\nhad never harmed him. At the same time, by making a happy home-life\r\nimpossible, he shut out what was perhaps the last chance that he might\r\nbecome in any sense of the words a good man.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, his submission brought him freedom. On March\r\n10, 1732, he went through the formal ceremony of betrothal. Some of\r\nthe guests remarked that his eyes were filled with tears and that he\r\nturned abruptly from his betrothed to a lady who was supposed to be\r\nthe mistress of his heart. But a year’s respite was granted him. While\r\nAustrian statesmen schemed to turn the timid, ignorant Elizabeth of\r\nBrunswick-Bevern into a woman of the world, who might make her husband\r\na Hapsburg partisan, Frederick was learning his work as colonel not far\r\nfrom the field of Fehrbellin. It was drudgery, but it was not Cüstrin.\r\nAfter a year of it he wrote: “I have just drilled, I drill, I shall\r\ndrill. That is all the news. But it is delightful to indulge in a few\r\nmoments’ breathing-space, and I would rather drill here from dawn to\r\ndusk than live as a rich man at Berlin.”\r\n\r\nJune 12, 1733, was Frederick’s wedding-day. The Austrian diplomats, who\r\nhad made the match, went far towards flinging away their advantage. At\r\nthe last moment they dared to suggest that Frederick William should\r\naccommodate the Emperor by entering into a new combination which\r\nassigned an English bride to his son. The King was furious at the\r\nslight, and the marriage was only another step towards the alienation\r\nof the Hapsburgs and the Hohenzollerns.\r\n\r\nAfter his marriage Frederick’s father still dictated his movements and\r\nkept him short of money. But the period of dragooning was over, and\r\nit becomes important to enquire what Frederick William had achieved\r\nby this stage of the second education begun with crime and carried on\r\nwith cruelty. One answer to this question must be mentioned because it\r\nis supported by the authority of Carlyle. He holds that the execution\r\nof Katte was just, that the imprisonment of Frederick was salutary,\r\nthat the King was a father yearning to reconcile his son with God and\r\nwith himself, and that he was not only just and affectionate but also\r\nsuccessful. An opinion more widely held is that the execution and\r\nimprisonment were unjust but politic, that reasons of state excused\r\nthem, that their righteousness was proved by their success, and that by\r\nthem Prussia gained a hero who made her great among the nations of the\r\nearth as none but he was able.\r\n\r\nOn reflection we may think it strange that results so great should\r\nhave been achieved by a scheme of education so stupid. The King owed\r\nthe best features of his plan to suggestions from outside. He had\r\ncondemned his son to tedious, nay, dangerous idleness: it was Wolden\r\nwho obtained for him a grudging permission to work. He had set him to\r\nlearn agriculture by attending board meetings: it was Hille who urged\r\nthat he should be allowed to see how farming was carried on. The united\r\nefforts of Hille and Wolden could not convince him that the heir to the\r\nthrone needed any books save books of devotion. These faults, though\r\nsignificant, were errors of detail. But the King’s whole plan is open\r\nto graver objections. It is in fact based on three of the commonest\r\nyet most fatal errors with regard to education. That boys are dough or\r\nputty to be placed in a mould and beaten till they take the exact shape\r\nof it, that a youth who is destined for a given career will succeed\r\nbest by trying to make himself a facsimile of some one else who has\r\nbeen successful in it, and that it is good to limit training to the\r\nacquisition of professional aptitude—these are errors which Frederick\r\nWilliam held in common with pedants and doctrinaires of every era.\r\n\r\nFrom Frederick’s birth onwards he had laboured to give him his own\r\ncharacteristics, even his own vices, in the hope that as his son’s\r\nconduct grew like his own, so also would his policy. This was still\r\nthe aim of all his measures. But the second education is distinguished\r\nfrom the first by the ghastly object-lesson with which it opens and\r\nby its appearance of success. The death of Katte affords the measure\r\nof Frederick William’s powers as a teacher. It imperilled the health,\r\neven the reason of his pupil, but assuredly it was not forgotten. Are\r\nwe then to infer that the King’s system atoned for its faults by its\r\ntriumph? That Frederick was bullied into love for his father seems\r\nincredible. It is true that in public he spoke little ill of him,\r\neither before his death, when it would have been dangerous to himself,\r\nor after it, when it would have been detrimental to the office which\r\nhe had inherited. But neither his motto nor his conduct after 1730\r\nbetokened love. “Far from love, far from the thunderbolt,” are not\r\nwords of affection, nor is it filial piety to cozen, to flatter, and\r\nto shun. He addressed the King as “most all-gracious Father,” while\r\nhe secretly petitioned the foes of Prussia for funds wherewith to play\r\nupon his weakness for tall recruits. It was like a foretaste of death,\r\nhe said, when a hussar appeared to command his presence at Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt may at once be granted that in conduct Frederick was transformed.\r\nBefore his disgrace he had been a trifler, after it he worked hard till\r\nthe day of his death. What is doubtful is that this result could not\r\nhave been obtained at a less cost. There is no evidence that the King\r\nhad ever tried the normal method of giving his son a fitting task and\r\na reasonable independence in performing it. Frederick, moreover, was\r\nnearing the age at which many triflers develop a new spirit. During his\r\nyear of exile his health improved. He became stouter in body and firmer\r\nin gait, so that at first even Wilhelmina did not recognise him. This\r\nchange at least was not designed by the father who wished him dead, yet\r\nto this may be ascribed much of his novel energy.\r\n\r\nIt is still less certain that his character had gained from the second\r\neducation. Many of the striking traits of old reappear. Frederick is\r\nstill before all else brilliant—a gay and versatile young man with\r\nelastic spirits and a passion for music, society, and intellectual\r\nconversation. Despite his father’s hatred of all things French,\r\nFrederick still looked on Paris as the Mecca of civilisation. His\r\nliterary ambitions were more pronounced than ever. At Cüstrin he had\r\ngone back to verses—verses always Gallic, copious, and bad. A Prussian\r\npatriot lamented that while he knew not whether his ancestors had won\r\nMagdeburg at cards or in some other way, he had Aristotle’s rules of\r\ncomposition by heart. Yet, for all his perseverance, Lord Mahon speaks\r\nwith justice of “his two kinds of prose, the rhymed and unrhymed.”\r\nIn the darkest hours of his struggle against all Europe, he sat down\r\nto rhyme in French. “He does not really know the Germans at all,”\r\ncomplained his tutors. Though sometimes brutal, he prided himself on\r\nhis ceremonious politeness—a German version of Louis XIV. All through\r\nhis career he was wont at times to put on the great monarch. “Hush,\r\ngentlemen,” once exclaimed Voltaire when his royal host thus suddenly\r\nstiffened, “the King of Prussia has just come in.” His morals were no\r\nbetter after confronting death than before. “The flesh is weak,” he\r\nwrites to his mother, “but I do not believe that Cato was Cato when he\r\nwas young.” It was said that the motive of his amours was vainglory\r\nrather than the satisfaction of vicious desires. No one, wrote harsh\r\ncritics, could rely upon his word, and few if any could tell of a\r\ndisinterested act that he had done.\r\n\r\nYet in some respects Frederick had gained. His talent for diplomacy\r\ngrew with the need for it. His father’s schooling had this effect—that\r\nhe learned to outwit his father. The closing years of Frederick\r\nWilliam’s life were cheered by the mirage of a good son and a\r\ngood husband, which of all Frederick’s fabrications was perhaps\r\nthe cleverest. Progress in diplomacy was attended by increase of\r\nself-control. Frederick learned in a hard school to disguise his true\r\nemotions and to feign what he did not feel. Hence arises a difficulty\r\nwhich Carlyle constantly encounters as he strives to approach his hero\r\nwith paternal sympathy and to penetrate into his inner man. He is\r\nforced to speak of Frederick’s “polished panoply,” and to describe him\r\nas “outwardly a radiant but metallic object to mankind.”\r\n\r\nThe King’s handiwork may be discerned in the increasing poverty of\r\naffection that his son displayed. Frederick William had killed his\r\nfriend, proscribed his associates, banished his sister, placed his\r\nmother under a cloud, and forced upon him a wife whom he despised.\r\nIt is not surprising that Frederick’s heart, never of the tenderest,\r\ngrew harder year by year. He turned to the friendship of men, always\r\ndifficult for kings to win, and doubly difficult for an autocrat who\r\nwas not prone to self-sacrifice. It was remarked of him in later\r\nlife that he softened only in illness, and that the sure sign of his\r\nrecovery was renewed harshness towards those about him. His intimates\r\nwere chiefly devotees of art and letters, among whom Voltaire was\r\nchief. But the very name of Voltaire, whom Frederick first adored and\r\nthen expelled, hints at the transient nature of these ties. As his\r\nsister, his mother, and Madame de Camas were one by one removed by\r\ndeath, he became bankrupt of affection, and his old age was consoled\r\nonly by the fidelity of his servants and of his dogs.\r\n\r\nSuch was Frederick at his marriage, but his very defects contributed\r\nfor a time to his social success. An accomplished man, with great\r\nflashing eyes and flexible, resonant voice, “musical even in cursing,”\r\nhe had a genuine relish for the circle of which he was the centre. His\r\nschooling had given him skill in seeming what he pleased, and whatever\r\naffection he possessed was given to his friends. At Rheinsberg, where\r\nhe built himself a house and lived from 1736 till 1740, he was gay,\r\nhospitable, and refined, living in apparent amity with his wife and\r\nfitting himself by study and by administration to fill the throne in\r\nhis turn.\r\n\r\nThe year after Frederick’s marriage, the year 1734, was of high\r\nimportance in his career. The war of the Polish Succession had\r\nbroken out between France and the Empire, and Prussia fulfilled her\r\nobligations by sending an auxiliary force of ten thousand men to serve\r\non the Rhine under Eugene. In this campaign, which proved inglorious,\r\nFrederick played the part of an eager novice, dogging the footsteps\r\nof the aged hero and copying even his curt manner. There he laid to\r\nheart several fruitful facts—that the great commander never accepted\r\npraise to his face, that the enemy feared him more than they feared\r\nhis army, and that other German troops cut a sorry figure beside the\r\nmen of Prussia. And—though his father had ordered him to keep out of\r\nharm’s way—he proved by his calm while cannon-balls were splintering\r\ntrees around him that the traditional courage of the Hohenzollerns had\r\ndescended to him.\r\n\r\nNext year (1735) he begged to go to the war again, but the King,\r\nwho had been near death from dropsy, put him off with a journey to\r\nOst-Preussen. This was the first of those official tours of inspection\r\nwhich later became one of the chief occupations of Frederick’s years\r\nof peace. In 1736 he began a far more agreeable pursuit. It was then\r\nthat he established himself at Rheinsberg, and, that, to quote his own\r\ntestimony, he began to live.\r\n\r\nTo live, in Frederick’s vocabulary, meant to read. He plunged into\r\nbooks, comparing, annotating, analysing, and learned by four days’\r\ntrial the lesson of the zealous freshman—that man needs more than two\r\nhours’ sleep a day. To the remonstrances of the doctors he replied that\r\nhe would rather suffer in body than in mind. Books were supplemented\r\nby conversation, the society of ladies, music, theatricals, literary\r\neffort of every kind. His _Anti-Machiavel_, a treatise on the duty of\r\nprinces, attracted the attention of Europe, and men of liberal mind\r\nawaited with impatience the moment at which he would be able to put his\r\nvirtuous maxims into practice. Meanwhile he revelled in intercourse\r\nwith philosophers and learned men. Frederick styled his house “the\r\ntemple of friendship,” and his guests rejoiced to find that the palace\r\nof a Crown Prince could be Liberty Hall.\r\n\r\nYet the hand of Frederick William was not entirely invisible. Thrice\r\nevery Sunday must the master of the house tear himself from philosophy\r\nto go to church, and he was also compelled to read the sermons which\r\nhis father’s favourite chaplains had composed. His own select preacher\r\nwas Voltaire, with whom and with his intimates he “reasoned high Of\r\nprovidence, fore-knowledge, will and fate, Passion and apathy and\r\nglory and shame.” From history he learned much for every department of\r\nlife; from philosophy chiefly contempt for religion and a deep-rooted\r\nfatalism which sustained him at many moments of disaster. He speaks of\r\n\r\n    “this Necessity, which orders all things, directs our\r\n    intercourse and determines our fate.” “I know too well that we\r\n    cannot escape from the inexorable laws of fate ... and that it\r\n    would be folly to desire to oppose what is Necessity and was so\r\n    arranged from all eternity. I admit that consolation drawn from\r\n    the impossibility of avoiding an evil is not very well fitted\r\n    to make the evil lighter, but still there is something calming\r\n    in the thought that the bitter which we must taste is not the\r\n    result of our fault, but pertains to the design and arrangement\r\n    of Providence.”\r\n\r\nIn such discussions passed many hours of the halcyon period, 1736–1740.\r\nOf perhaps higher value was the insight into the possibilities of human\r\nprovidence which Frederick gained during his visits to Ost-Preussen.\r\nThere he saw how the hand of his father had turned a wilderness into\r\nthe most blooming of his provinces, so that a land which the King had\r\nfound swept bare of men by the plague now contained half a million\r\nprosperous inhabitants. When at last (May 31, 1740) he took the place\r\nof the father whose last hours his presence had consoled, it was with\r\na conviction that if his foreign policy had been contemptible, he had\r\nshown himself heroic at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VOLTAIRE.\r\n\r\nFROM THE STATUE BY HOUDON AT THE COMÉDIE FRANÇAIS.]\r\n\r\nThe time had come when the domestic organisation of Prussia was to\r\nacquire a new significance in Europe. At Rheinsberg, while protesting\r\nthat he desired nothing more in life than to be left in peace with\r\nhis books and his friends, Frederick had been steadily pursuing the\r\nstudy of politics. In 1738 he had set down on paper “Considerations”\r\nwhich pointed to the need of a new champion to defend the liberties\r\nof Europe against the stealthy and menacing expansion of France. It\r\nremained to be seen whether Prussian foreign policy would in future be\r\ninfluenced by her singular constitution. To appreciate the meaning and\r\nthe value of Frederick’s innovations in both systems we must portray\r\nthe situation that he found on his accession. This demands in the first\r\nplace a brief scrutiny of Europe as it was at Frederick William’s death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF 1740\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his instructions for the education of his successor, Frederick\r\nprescribed a thorough course of European history from the time of the\r\nEmperor Charles V. (1519–1556) to his own reign. This had been the\r\nfavourite study of his own youth, so that at his accession he realised\r\nto the full that modern Europe owed little of its political contour\r\nto chance, but much to the aspirations and struggles of the several\r\nstates during the last two centuries. For modern Europe was no older\r\nthan Charles V. Right through the Middle Ages the Christian world\r\nmaintained that supreme authority, like truth, ought to be one, and\r\nthat every Christian should look up to the Emperor in matters temporal\r\nas he looked up to the Pope in matters spiritual. On the secular side,\r\nhowever, this theory had crumbled beneath its own weight. Even a\r\nCharlemagne could not really rule the world. As the various races of\r\nmankind who lived in England, France, Spain, and Scandinavia gradually\r\ncame under the sway of a few national rulers, the Emperor dwindled\r\ninto a dignified president of German princes. His lordship of the\r\nworld survived only in distracting claims to rule more widely and more\r\nexclusively than his attenuated power could warrant. Two sharp shocks\r\nheralded modern times. First Columbus bestowed upon his masters, the\r\nKings of Spain, a new world which had never heard of Pope and Emperor\r\nand which the Emperor at least did not pretend to sway. Then Luther,\r\nwrestling blindly with the papacy, shattered the central pillar of\r\nthe mediæval world, and modern history, the biography of a group of\r\nindependent states, began.\r\n\r\nThese states, however, did not enjoy unchallenged independence. Each\r\nhad to work out its own religious settlement, and—if it embraced\r\nthe Reformation—had to repel, with whatever help it could find, the\r\nrescue-work of the Pope and his allies. To the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, through the careers of Charles V., Elizabeth, William of\r\nOrange, Henry of Navarre, Romanist and Protestant States always\r\ntended to fall apart into two hostile camps. Even in Frederick’s time\r\nreligious affinity always counted for something. He had laid history\r\nto heart and, as we shall see, profited in his dealings with England\r\nby the old cry of “Church in danger.” On his lips the cry was a mere\r\nruse. The day of crusades was over. In the sixteenth century Spain,\r\nAustria, and Italy rejected the Reformation; England established its\r\nown Church; France came to terms with the Huguenots. At the great Peace\r\nof Westphalia Germany established parity between the warring creeds, a\r\nboon tardily won by thirty years of desolation. Thenceforward affairs\r\nof state came first in every land. Louis XIV.’s revocation of the\r\nEdict of Nantes in 1685 proved that religious aggression was to be\r\nfeared only as the sequel of undue political preponderance. From the\r\nbirth of modern states down to our own time, the bugbear of the nations\r\nhas been world-rule and their watchword equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe first prince who threatened to restore in fact if not in form the\r\nworld-rule which had broken down in the Middle Ages was Charles V.,\r\nthe scion and pattern of the House of Hapsburg, whose career is the\r\nnarrative of European politics from 1519 to 1556. France, which he\r\nthreatened most, took the lead against him, began the long duel between\r\nBourbon and Hapsburg, and thus guarded the liberties of Europe till the\r\nclose of the Thirty Years’ War (1648). Then Louis XIV. threatened to\r\nmake France in her turn mistress of the world. The equilibrium which\r\nhe, as absolute ruler of the foremost State of Europe, seemed to have\r\noverthrown, was painfully re-established at Utrecht (1713). A new and\r\ngreater Thirty Years’ War was thus brought to an end. It left the\r\nStates weary and timid, dreading France as a century earlier they had\r\ndreaded Spain, clinging to peace lest the whole fabric of Europe should\r\ncollapse and with it the gains which they had made or hoped to make\r\nshould vanish. France, conscious of weakness in spite of the glories of\r\nLouis XIV., turned to diplomacy and won Lorraine. England, ridden on a\r\nloose rein by Walpole, followed her natural bent towards the sea. For\r\nAustria and the Hapsburg Charles VI., the great problem was to keep\r\nwhat had already been heaped together. Only Spain was not afraid to\r\nbreak the peace, and in the long run she gained parts of Italy by her\r\nboldness.\r\n\r\nMost of the territorial profits made by European Powers during the\r\nyears 1713–1740 were made at the expense of Charles VI., either as head\r\nof the Hapsburgs or as Emperor. As it became certain that he would\r\nhave no son, he grew more and more reckless in sacrificing the welfare\r\nof the Empire to that of his House. The future of his heir was indeed\r\nprecarious. For there was not and never had been an Austria in the same\r\nsense in which there was an England, a France, or a Spain; that is, a\r\nwell-knit nation, preferring ruin to dismemberment. “Austria” meant\r\nthe dominions of the elder branch of the House of Hapsburg just as\r\n“Prussia” under Frederick I. meant the dominions of the elder branch of\r\nthe House of Hohenzollern. In the case of the Hapsburg agglomeration,\r\nhowever, the subjects were too many, too miscellaneous, and too\r\nrich for the work of a Frederick William to be possible. Germans,\r\nHungarians, and Italians were only the chief among a motley crowd of\r\nraces which had come under the sceptre of Charles VI.’s ancestors and\r\nwhich he strained every nerve to hand down to his daughter undispersed.\r\n\r\nThe method which Charles selected was to proclaim that his dominions\r\nwere one and indivisible, and descended to a female heir if no male\r\nwere forthcoming. This he did by the famous Pragmatic Sanction, a\r\ndocument which for fifteen years, from 1725 to 1740, was the pivot\r\nof European politics. From State after State Charles purchased a\r\nguarantee of the Pragmatic Sanction, which amounted to an undertaking\r\nto recognise his daughter, Maria Theresa, as heir to the Hapsburg\r\ndominions. For this he yielded to Spain broad lands in Italy, for\r\nthis he sacrificed commercial prospects to the sea-powers England and\r\nHolland, for this he consented that Lorraine should pass from Germany\r\nto France, for this he followed Russia into a Turkish war which cost\r\nhim great tracts on either side the Danube. For this, too, he committed\r\nwhat was perhaps the most dangerous of all his blunders. He played fast\r\nand loose with a time-honoured ally, and estranged the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nEver since the Peace of Westphalia had given them freedom to make\r\nalliances where they would, the policy of the Hohenzollerns had been to\r\nmaintain a good understanding with Austria. It might, indeed, happen,\r\nas after 1679, when Louis XIV. hired them, that some other course\r\nbecame so advantageous that for the moment they adopted it. In general\r\nhowever, the Emperor had most to give. To him the German princes still\r\nlooked for investiture, for arbitration, and for promotion, and if a\r\nState desired to exercise its troops, who was so likely as the lord\r\nof the long Hapsburg frontiers to be at war? King Frederick William\r\nmight reasonably hope that the Power which had given his father the\r\ncrown, which had led Prussians to victory before Turin, and which had\r\npermitted him to keep conquests in Swedish Pomerania (1720), would\r\nreward his devoted service by favouring his pretensions to inheritance\r\non the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThough a forceful squire, as a statesman the King lacked imagination.\r\nHe was master of the finest soldiers in Europe, yet he dared not\r\nvindicate his claims to Jülich-Berg without the help of the Emperor,\r\nand he could not understand that the Emperor might be reluctant to help\r\nthe master of the finest soldiers in Europe. Such was, however, the\r\ntruth. The rise of the Hohenzollerns had long been watched at Vienna\r\nwith not unnatural jealousy. Even against the Turk Prussians were but\r\nsparingly enlisted. The gift of the crown had been hotly opposed and\r\nbitterly regretted. When Frederick William cried, “The Emperor will\r\nhave to spurn me from him with his feet: I am his unto death, faithful\r\nto the last drop of my blood,” it was already a Hapsburg maxim that a\r\nnew Vandal kingdom must not arise on the shores of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nThe statesmen at Vienna valued the Prussian alliance enough to employ\r\nGrumbkow and the Austrian ministers at Berlin to hoodwink Frederick\r\nWilliam. As we have seen, they lavished pocket-money and sacrificed\r\na bride in the hope of securing ascendancy over his son. But they\r\nblundered greatly when to please England and thereby to further the\r\nPragmatic Sanction, they bade the King break off a marriage which all\r\nthe world knew was fixed for the very next day, and they blundered\r\nstill more when to please France and Holland with the same end in view\r\nthey withdrew the promise of supporting him in Jülich-Berg. In 1732\r\nFrederick William, for the only time in his life, met Charles VI. face\r\nto face and the truth with regard to the relations between Hapsburg\r\nand Hohenzollern began to dawn upon him. All his life he had been the\r\nvassal of an Emperor whom he had imagined as a German overlord, heir to\r\nthe dignity of the Cæsars, who when the time was ripe would look with\r\npaternal complacency upon the Prussian claims. The vision faded and\r\nrevealed a rival monarch, pompous, contemptuous, and shifty. The shock\r\nof disillusionment was terrible, but before his death he saw clearly.\r\nOnce, it is said, he pointed to Frederick with the words, “There stands\r\none who will avenge me.” It is certain that with failing breath he\r\nwarned his son against the policy of Vienna.\r\n\r\nThus, even supposing that Frederick’s view of politics had been no\r\nwider than his father’s, that he had come to the throne resolved merely\r\nto keep up a great army and to win Jülich-Berg, he would none the less\r\nhave possessed remarkable freedom of action. In foreign politics he was\r\nfettered by only one great treaty, that of Berlin (December, 1728), by\r\nwhich Prussia undertook to maintain the Pragmatic Sanction. But it was\r\npossible to contend that this agreement, which was made in secret to\r\nsecure the Emperor’s assistance in Jülich-Berg, became void in 1739,\r\nwhen Austria entered into conflicting engagements with France.\r\n\r\nCircumstances, too, were favourable to Frederick’s liberty. The\r\nvery existence of the Pragmatic Sanction, a violent remedy against\r\ndissolution, was a guarantee that Austria would be harmless for years\r\nto come. If Charles VI. and his heir were loath to uphold Prussia on\r\nthe Rhine, they would be very unlikely to risk their own existence by\r\ntaking up arms against her. In other quarters Prussia had little to\r\nfear. Hanover, the parvenu electorate which lay like a broad barrier\r\nacross the direct road from Berlin to the West, had become a dependency\r\nof England in 1714, and therefore was not dangerous. Whatever might be\r\nthe wishes of George II., it was certain that Walpole would not spend\r\nblood and treasure to maintain the House of Pfalz-Sulzbach, Prussia’s\r\nrival in Jülich-Berg, at Düsseldorf. The Dutch, it is true, felt\r\nthemselves menaced by a Prussian garrison in Cleves, but their course\r\nhad by this time become that of a mere cock-boat in the wake of Great\r\nBritain. France alone remained to be considered, and France, with a\r\nfrontier fifty leagues from Berg, was guided by a Walpole of her own,\r\nCardinal Fleury, now nearing the close of his eighty-seventh year. If\r\nthen Frederick elected to make Prussia more considerable among the\r\nPowers of the West by pressing his claims to Berg he could fling his\r\nsword into the scales of justice without great fear that a stronger\r\nhand would turn the balance against him.\r\n\r\nAdventure in the Rhine countries had much to commend it to the young\r\nKing. His House undoubtedly possessed some title to Berg, and it had\r\nbeen the secular policy of the Hohenzollerns to forego no claim without\r\narguing to the death. The busy and fertile Rhineland was a gold-mine\r\nin comparison with the sterile Mark. Frederick, as an enthusiast for\r\nthe higher civilisation of the West, might well feel drawn towards\r\na duchy which lay more than half-way along the direct line from his\r\ncapital to Paris. And, greatest merit of all in the eyes of a dynasty\r\nof merchants, Berg was eminently salable. The Rhenish duchies were like\r\ngood accommodation-lands in the midst of thriving farms. Many rulers\r\nwould always be glad of them and their price would therefore be high.\r\n\r\nBut the arguments against staking all on Berg were also strong. A\r\nstatesman trained between the Elbe and the Oder could hardly be unaware\r\nthat Prussia’s heritage in the West was a mere windfall and that by\r\ninterest as by situation she belonged to the system of the North. Her\r\nnatural outlook was towards the Baltic, which formed the only free road\r\nbetween her centre and her eastern wing. It was by foregoing lands\r\non the Baltic that she had gained rich bishoprics to the westward in\r\n1648. Baltic Powers, Poland, Russia, and above all Sweden, had steadily\r\ninfluenced her politics since the advent of the Great Elector. History\r\nand geography alike seemed to beckon young Frederick to the sea. Let us\r\ntherefore cast a glance at those among his neighbours whom he had to\r\ntake account of, whatever plan he might devise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK WILLIAM THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PAINTING BY F. W. WEIDEMAN.]\r\n\r\nJust as the traditional enemy of the Bourbon was the Hapsburg, so the\r\ntraditional enemy of the Hohenzollern was the Vasa. This gifted House\r\nhad ruled in Sweden since 1520 and had chosen for their country a path\r\nwhich it was not strong enough to follow to the end. They had striven\r\nto turn the Baltic into a Swedish lake by conquering all its coasts.\r\nSuccess seemed nearest when in 1630 Gustavus landed in Germany, and at\r\nthe point of the sword compelled his kinsman of Brandenburg to favour\r\nhis adventure. The result of these bold steps was for Sweden a swift\r\nblaze of glory; for Brandenburg a decade of misery inflicted in great\r\npart by Swedish hands. In 1648 the great treaty compensated the Swedes\r\nfor their work by driving the Great Elector from the mouth of the Oder.\r\nTheir ambition to be masters of the Baltic shores, however, remained,\r\nand the Great Elector suffered much at their hands before the Peace of\r\nOliva (1660) confirmed his sovereignty over Ost-Preussen. What happened\r\nat Fehrbellin and after it has been already told. The meteoric career\r\nof Charles XII. (1697–1718), who began by humbling Prussia, but ended\r\nby losing Stettin to her, is no part of our story, except in so far\r\nas it interested and influenced young Frederick. It suffices that in\r\n1740 Sweden was factious and impotent, and that her aged King still\r\nheld that part of Pomerania which Prussia did not possess. To acquire\r\nWestern Pomerania was therefore a possible object for Frederick’s\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nThe central mass of the Hohenzollern dominions touched along almost\r\nthe whole of its eastern frontier a Power whose decline was even\r\nmore visible than that of Sweden. The Polish Republic, which almost\r\nencircled Ost-Preussen, formed perhaps the strangest spectacle that\r\nEurope has ever seen. A vaster country than any of the Western Powers,\r\nPoland remained in the Middle Ages. Her constitution, indeed, seemed\r\nto have no other end than to make progress impossible. There were\r\nonly two classes, nobles and serfs, the free and the unfree. But where\r\nevery freeman was noble, many nobles were poor. These served for hire,\r\nand were distinguished, it is said, from men of lower birth by the\r\nprivilege of being flogged upon a Turkey carpet. The direction of this\r\nvast country rested with a few thousand feudal chiefs who elected a\r\nnominal King from within their own body or outside it. They made the\r\nlaws themselves, but a single dissentient voice could wreck the work\r\nof a whole Diet, as the annual session of Parliament was termed, and\r\nof late years this right had commonly been exercised. What trade there\r\nwas, was left to the despised class of German burghers. The fighting\r\nforce grew every year more feeble. While Austria could boast a Eugene\r\nand Russia a Peter, while the parade-ground at Potsdam was trodden\r\nby ever-growing masses of men who handled modern weapons with the\r\nprecision given by daily practice, the Poles were blindly trusting in\r\nfeudal levies generalled by a puppet King.\r\n\r\nAt Frederick’s accession, however, Poland still possessed two elements\r\nof strength besides her vast bulk and the knightly courage of her\r\nsons. These were the Saxon connexion and the port of Danzig. Two years\r\nearlier, at the price of war with France (1733–1738) and loss of lands\r\nin Italy, Charles VI. had secured the Polish crown for the son of the\r\nlate King, Augustus III., the Elector of Saxony. The Emperor made this\r\nsacrifice to win support for the Pragmatic Sanction and to propitiate\r\nRussia, who looked upon Poland as her own if the French candidate were\r\nexpelled. And, as the road from Dresden to Warsaw passed through the\r\nHapsburg province of Silesia, Augustus had good reason to be faithful\r\nto the daughter of Charles VI.\r\n\r\nPoland none the less promised much to a king of Prussia who could wait.\r\nHer artificial connexion with Saxony, established by foreign Powers\r\nagainst the will of a majority of the Poles, could only weaken the\r\nfrail bonds which bound the State together. Poland, all the world had\r\nlong known, would one day fall in pieces, and who should hinder Prussia\r\nfrom gathering some of them? For the moment, however, Augustus could\r\ndefend his new dominions. A king of Prussia in a fever to act at once\r\ncould not assail Poland without laying bare his flank to Saxony and to\r\nher Imperial ally.\r\n\r\nBut could Prussia in 1740 afford to wait? If Augustus’s dream were to\r\nbe fulfilled would not she be in jeopardy? The Elector hoped that the\r\nEmperor would cede to him a part of Lower Silesia, so that Prussia\r\nmight be for ever divided and hemmed in by a Saxon-Polish State. Had we\r\nno other guide than the map, we might be tempted to guess that it was\r\nto avert this peril that Frederick seized Silesia. If it were true it\r\nwere a grievous fault. Augustus, who was no statesman, might dream of\r\na hereditary crown, but a firm Saxony-Poland was in fact impossible.\r\nDresden and Warsaw were centuries apart. Out of two such halves no\r\nstrong whole could be compounded. The one was German, the other Slav;\r\nthe one industrial, the other primitive; the one Lutheran, the other\r\npartly Romanist and partly Orthodox. Compounds so discordant could\r\nhave found no abiding unity in a monarchy based on the treason of their\r\ncommon head against the constitution of each. Nor could such a State\r\nhave barred for a decade the path of the Muscovite Colossus which Peter\r\nhad already roused and which Catherine and Alexander were soon to\r\nreinspire.\r\n\r\nIn weighing Frederick’s wisdom we must not forget that the share of\r\nPoland which he might expect that Prussia was destined to acquire,\r\nand which did, in fact, fall to her during his own lifetime, would\r\nchange Ost-Preussen from an isolated province into a strong limb of a\r\nwell-knit State. It gave her the lower waters of a third great arterial\r\nriver—the Vistula. But it came to her in 1774 shorn of its chief glory,\r\nthe old portal of the Vistula and strong tower of Poland, the matchless\r\ntown of Danzig. Frederick had seen that fair city, a hearth of German\r\nculture among the Slavs, with its giant Marienkirche towering over\r\na mass of battlements and gates and churches of stately civic halls\r\nand mansions hardly less stately, the whole forming a Venice of the\r\nNorth beside which his capital was but a market town. He must have\r\ntaken note of the foundation of all this grandeur, great warehouses\r\non busy wharves, canals crowded with masts and hulls from many lands.\r\nAnd he cannot have been blind to the fact that within a few miles of\r\nthis prize lay Ost-Preussen, and that, since Augustus had surrendered\r\nCurland, within a few miles of Ost-Preussen lay Russia. Seldom has a\r\nking had clearer warning to look before he leaped.\r\n\r\nThus, without departing from the policy of the men who had made Prussia\r\nwhat she was, the young King had his choice between adventure on the\r\nRhine or across the Peene and a policy of expectant watchfulness on\r\nthe Vistula. But if he were capable of building upon the foundations\r\nof his forefathers the loftiest structure that they would bear, then a\r\nstill more glorious conquest might be his. Lord of Stettin and of the\r\nports of Ost-Preussen, he might claim a share in what all the nations\r\ncoveted, the empire of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most grotesque facts in history that the Emperor\r\nWilliam II., when he cried, “Our future lies upon the water,” should\r\nhave been uttering as prophecy what ought to have been commonplace for\r\na century and a half. Even in 1740 the truth that the New World offered\r\na fairer career than the Old was not hidden from statesmen less astute\r\nthan Frederick. Since the Armada foundered in 1588, the nations of\r\nEurope had been realising it one by one. Spain and Portugal, the first\r\nin the field, still held a vast heritage across the ocean, but their\r\nmonopoly was not as unchallenged as of old. First the Dutch, who as\r\nsubjects of Spain had monopolised that carrying-trade which seemed to\r\nbe beneath the dignity of an Iberian gentleman, enriched themselves so\r\nrapidly that they were able to throw off the yoke of Philip II. and to\r\nestablish a colonial and commercial empire of their own. Then England,\r\ntardily comprehending the changing conditions of life, grappled with\r\ntheir little republic in a long and doubtful struggle. Finally weight\r\ntold, and after the Revolution of 1688 England under her Dutch\r\nKing led the way and Holland followed in a campaign against a rival\r\ndangerous to both. For France had been guided by Colbert into the path\r\nof greatness beyond the seas, and it was by grasping at Spain and the\r\nIndies that Louis XIV. aroused the keenest apprehensions that he might\r\nbecome dictator of the world. Only at the cost of two mighty wars had\r\nthe danger from France been averted for a generation. By the Peace of\r\nUtrecht (1713) the Sea Powers gained security for themselves and for\r\ntheir commerce, but the prize of North America still remained to be\r\nfought for between France and England.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the eighteenth century other competitors put to\r\nsea. Under Peter the Great, the new land Power, Russia, struggled to\r\nbecome maritime, though her horizon, as yet, hardly extended beyond\r\nEuropean waters. But in 1722 the Emperor Charles VI. made his port\r\nof Ostend the headquarters of a new Imperial East India Company,\r\nand England, France, and Holland joined in an outcry against German\r\ncompetition. Nine years later they were appeased. The Hapsburg\r\nsacrificed the future of his House to its past. To purchase guarantees\r\nof the Pragmatic Sanction he withdrew his support from the Company,\r\nwhich none the less was able to maintain itself for more than sixty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIf then the tide had set so strongly towards distant continents that\r\neven conservative ill-knit Austria was swept along with it, we may well\r\nask, what of Prussia? The history of our own time makes the question\r\nmore pertinent. North Germany has shown beyond dispute not only that\r\nshe can now build ships, a fact which proves little or nothing as to\r\nher powers in the past, but also that she can fill them with brave\r\nand skilful seamen, whose character only many generations of worthy\r\nforefathers could create. These forefathers were the Prussians of\r\nFrederick’s day, poor, fearless, and docile, living on the borders of\r\nthe Baltic, speeding and welcoming its fleets at Memel, at Pillau,\r\nat Colberg, and above all at Stettin. Why, it may be wondered, was\r\nFrederick blind to the signs of the times? Why did not he at the very\r\noutset of his reign hasten to employ the power of the Crown, which\r\nFrederick William had raised so high, to equip a Prussian Baltic\r\nCompany, a Prussian West Africa Company, even a Prussian East India\r\nCompany?\r\n\r\nNever was the political situation more favourable to such an enterprise\r\nthan when Frederick grasped the reins. No neighbour could enforce a\r\nveto upon Prussian maritime enterprise. Poland was in the last stage of\r\nimpotence and decay. Russia, who might form a good customer, was not\r\nyet equipped for conquest. Austria could not afford to offend a German\r\nally. Sweden had lost her sting and her province of Pomerania was a\r\nhostage at Frederick’s mercy. The Sea Powers would view the enterprise\r\naskance, but they too had given hostages to Prussia. If England played\r\nfoul, the master of eighty thousand men could overrun Hanover in a\r\nfortnight and the Dutch would think twice ere they provoked the lord\r\nof Cleves. Of all Powers Denmark, the surly janitor of the Baltic,\r\nwas perhaps the best able to injure Prussian commerce with impunity,\r\nbut the heir of the Great Elector might be trusted to find a way with\r\nDenmark. Thus Europe seemed to invite Prussia to follow the destiny\r\nwhich nature prescribed, and which led to wealth. Firmly governed,\r\narmed to the teeth, learned, Protestant, and rich, she might have\r\npursued her old opportunist policy on the mainland with full confidence\r\nthat the future would bring her wider boundaries and yet greater\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier generation and with smaller means the Great Elector had\r\nperceived that the true path for Prussia lay across the seas. Balked of\r\nStettin, he strove to make Pillau and Memel his London and Amsterdam.\r\nHis little Armada of ten frigates attacked the Spaniards with success.\r\nIn a humble way there began to be Brandenburgish West Indies, and in\r\n1683 Fort Great-Fredericksburgh was built upon the Brandenburgish\r\nGold Coast. But the Great Elector’s son and grandson lacked either\r\nhis firm hand or his imagination. While Frederick I. was squabbling\r\nwith the Dutch about armchairs, the Dutch were driving his subjects\r\nfrom West Africa. Frederick William, the apostle of domestic economy,\r\nwas impatient of flunkeys, universities, and colonies, the several\r\nextravagances of his father and of his grandfather. Would Frederick II.\r\nprove himself more enlightened?\r\n\r\nWe see with amazement that he did not. A prince who was accounted\r\nclever, who had spent the first decade of manhood in pondering on high\r\npolitics, who revered the memory of the Great Elector, and followed\r\nthe fortunes of England with keen interest—how could such an one ignore\r\nwhat the movement of the times and the course of after events seem\r\nto point out so clearly? Among his first acts was the establishment\r\nof a new department of manufactures. He commanded the head of it to\r\ntake measures for improving the condition of existing industries, for\r\nintroducing new ones, and for bringing in foreign capital and foreign\r\nhands. Why did he not at the same time establish a department of\r\nmarine? Why did he wait till East Frisia fell to Prussia before making\r\neven a half-hearted effort to win profit from the sea?\r\n\r\nA partial explanation may lie in the fact that Frederick lacked the\r\ninspiration drawn from travel. The stupid fears of Frederick William\r\nthat his son would become too Frenchified in his life or too Austrian\r\nin his politics had closed to Frederick the doors of the best school\r\nof his time. Who knows how much profit the Great Elector brought to\r\nhis State from his education in Holland, or Peter the Great from his\r\njourneys in the West? Save at Danzig, Frederick had hardly seen with\r\nhis own eyes the dignity which commerce might create. Save for two\r\nstolen days in Strasburg in the first months of his reign, a secret\r\nvisit to Holland in 1755, and a meeting with the Emperor in Moravia in\r\n1770, he was fated never to gain fresh knowledge of what would now be\r\nforeign lands except at the head of his army.\r\n\r\nAgain, Frederick’s political economy was unfavourable to Prussian\r\ncommerce. At Cüstrin he learned from Hille that the only trade by which\r\na country can profit is that which adds to its stock of gold and\r\nsilver. His father had carried this idea to its logical conclusion. He\r\nhad seized the precious metals and locked them up. Like a timid farmer\r\nwho thinks that the bank will break, he had hidden in his cellars\r\nthe hoard which represented the economies of a lifetime. Frederick\r\ntherefore found a treasure of more than twenty-six million marks, at a\r\ntime when the weekly wage of a common soldier hardly exceeded one.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that a policy of hoarding could be wise only when war\r\nwas in sight. In time of war that Government would be happiest which\r\nhad most coined money with which to pay its troops. But in time of\r\npeace not even Frederick William could take a breed from barren metal\r\nby keeping it locked up. Profit could be drawn from it in either of two\r\nways. The coined metal might be spent to advantage, so that the State\r\nbought something, such as a school, or a farm, or a flock of sheep,\r\nwhich would in the future be worth more than the sum laid out. Or it\r\nmight be lent to citizens who would pay for the use of it and establish\r\nwith its aid some business which might be taxed. By locking up the\r\nsurplus funds of the country, however, the King stifled commerce at the\r\nbirth. Frederick did not detect the fallacy, and Germany waited till\r\nthe nineteenth century for her commercial rise.\r\n\r\nThough nimble-witted and fond of philosophy, the King was hardly\r\nprofound. His lector, the Swiss de Catt, tells a significant story of\r\nhis first discussion with a singular stranger on a Dutch vessel, whom\r\nhe did not suspect to be the lord of Prussia. Frederick, he says,\r\n\r\n    “tried to prove that creation was impossible. At this last\r\n    point I stood out in opposition. ‘But how can one create\r\n    something out of nothing?’ said he. ‘That is not the question,’\r\n    answered I, ‘the question is, whether such a Being as God can\r\n    or cannot give existence to what has yet none?’ He seemed\r\n    embarrassed and added, ‘But the Universe is eternal.’ ‘You are\r\n    in a circle,’ said I, ‘how will you get out of it?’ ‘I skip\r\n    over it,’ said he, laughing; and then began to speak of other\r\n    things.”\r\n\r\nHe wrote incessantly on history and politics, always with the clearness\r\nand sprightliness that seem inseparable from the French tongue which\r\nhe employed, and always with the confidence of a journalist and of a\r\nking. Of his ancestor Joachim I. he says: “He received the surname of\r\nNestor in the same way as Louis XIII. that of ‘the Just’; that is, for\r\nno reason that any one can discover”—and this is a very fair example of\r\nhis style. Sense, lucidity, concise statement, even wit, distinguish\r\nhis writings. He made so many confident generalisations on political\r\naffairs that some have almost of necessity proved correct. But of deep\r\ninsight, still less of great constructive power, there is little trace.\r\n\r\nIn freedom from illusions, however, Frederick surpassed some rival\r\nstatesmen. This was abundantly illustrated at the very outset of his\r\nreign. He saw, as Charles VI. could not, that the claim of the Emperor\r\nto be lord of the world rested on no firm basis. Early in 1737 he had\r\nwritten: “If the Emperor dies to-day or to-morrow, what revolutions\r\nwill come to pass! Every one will wish to share his estate, and we\r\nshall see as many factions as there are sovereigns.” The discovery,\r\nindeed, was by no means new. More than a century earlier Gustavus\r\nAdolphus had told the Germans that their constitution was rotten.\r\nBut Frederick informs the Emperor pointedly that he is only first\r\namong his peers. He was equally clear-sighted in the choice of means\r\nto spread his views. William the Silent had perceived a fact dark to\r\nmany statesmen since his time—that the public opinion of Europe is\r\nworth much and that it may be courted through the Press. Frederick had\r\nalready composed the earliest of his many pamphlets, which he intended\r\nto publish anonymously as the work of an Englishman, to rouse the Sea\r\nPowers against France.\r\n\r\nMore significant than all else was the fact that he viewed his own\r\nstrength with clearer eyes than his father’s. Frederick William had\r\nnever been able to convince himself that Prussia was a strong State:\r\nFrederick wears no blinkers and with his accession the day of half\r\nmeasures is over. Two years before this he had written to Grumbkow\r\nwords which express his real opinion of the old policy of his House.\r\nThe affair of Berg, which he as Crown Prince earnestly hoped would\r\nenable him to win fame on the battle-field, had then entered upon a\r\nphase adverse to Prussian expectations. Austria had been prevailed on\r\nto join with France and the Sea Powers in claiming that it should be\r\nreferred to the arbitration of a congress, and Frederick William,\r\nthough disgusted, had decided to give way. Of this decision Grumbkow\r\napproved, writing, “I am persuaded that a King of Prussia, like a King\r\nof Sardinia, will always have more need of the fox’s hide than of the\r\nlion’s.” Frederick replies (March, 1738):\r\n\r\n    “I confess that I perceive in the answer a conflict between\r\n    greatness and humiliation to which I can never agree. The\r\n    answer is like the declaration of a man who has no stomach\r\n    for fighting and yet wishes to seem as if he had. There were\r\n    only two solutions, either to reply with noble pride, with\r\n    no evasions in the shape of petty negotiations whose real\r\n    value will soon be recognised, or to bow ourselves under the\r\n    degrading yoke that they wish to lay upon us. I am no subtle\r\n    politician to couple together a set of contradictory threats\r\n    and submissions, I am young, I would perhaps follow the\r\n    impetuosity of my nature; under no circumstances would I do\r\n    anything by halves.”\r\n\r\nClose observers held that a change of king would be followed by a\r\nchange of policy and that Frederick was likely to attempt great things.\r\nWhat these would be no one, with the possible exception of the young\r\nKing himself, had the least idea. What in the opinion of the present\r\nwriter they should have been is sufficiently indicated above. What they\r\nwere, will be shown in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nAt first, for all his determination to lose no time, the results of\r\nhis accession seemed but small. No human being could maintain that he\r\nwas swayed by his affections. Though Duhan, Keith, and Katte’s father\r\nreceived some measure of compensation for their sufferings, Frederick’s\r\nbehaviour towards those concerned in his early struggles emboldened\r\nthe wits to say that his memory was excellent as far back as 1730.\r\nHis Rheinsberg friends expected to share the spoils of office. They\r\nwere disappointed in a way that has reminded Macaulay of the treatment\r\nof Falstaff by Henry V. Frederick was as masterful as his father.\r\nThe aged Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, who had created the Prussian army,\r\nand the aged General von Schulenburg, who had risked all rather than\r\ncondemn Katte to death, were humiliated by royal reprimands. Grumbkow,\r\nwith whom he had corresponded for more than eight years in terms of\r\naffectionate intimacy, might have caused him a moment’s embarrassment,\r\nbut he had just died—“for me the greatest conceivable gain,” the\r\nKing assured his sister. He broke up his father’s useless and costly\r\nregiment of giant grenadiers, a measure which Frederick William had\r\nhimself advised, but he increased the effective strength of the army by\r\nnearly ten thousand men. At the same time he sounded, more clearly even\r\nthan his ancestor George William, the note of religious toleration for\r\nwhich Brandenburg had been honourably distinguished in the time of her\r\ngreatest peril. “In this country,” he instructed his officials, “every\r\none shall get to heaven in his own way.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF GLATZ IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nFROM AN OLD PRINT.]\r\n\r\nThe crowned philosopher always recognised the difference between the\r\nthings which were Cæsar’s and the things which were God’s. The scion\r\nof a Calvinist House, he began his reign by authorising the Lutherans\r\nto restore their ritual, which had been arbitrarily simplified by his\r\nfather. He was soon to court the favour of Breslau by supplying her\r\nwith Protestant preachers, and of Glatz by bestowing vestments upon\r\na statue of the Virgin. When Romanist Europe expelled the Jesuits,\r\nhe seized the opportunity of picking up well-trained teachers cheap.\r\nSome of his papist subjects had a fancy for buying handkerchiefs which\r\nbore the effigies of saints. Frederick, eager to encourage the linen\r\nmanufacture, bade his officials find out which saints were the most\r\npopular and adjust the supply to the demand.\r\n\r\nA story cited by Carlyle illuminates Frederick’s views upon the\r\nrelations between Church and State. He was questioning the monks of\r\nCleve, to whom the old dukes had assigned an income from the royal\r\nforest-dues for masses to be said on their behalf. “‘You still say\r\nthose masses then?’ ‘Certainly, your Majesty.’ ‘And what good does\r\nanybody get out of them?’ ‘Your Majesty, those old sovereigns are to\r\nobtain heavenly mercy by them, to be delivered out of purgatory by\r\nthem.’ ‘Purgatory? It is a sore thing for the Forests, all this while!\r\nAnd they are not yet out, those poor souls, after so many hundred years\r\nof praying?’ Monks have a fatal apprehension, No. ‘When will they be\r\nout, and the thing complete?’ Monks cannot say. ‘Send me a courier\r\nwhenever it _is_ complete!’ sneers the King,” and leaves them to\r\nfinish the _Te Deum_ which they had begun to greet his arrival.\r\n\r\nLastly, the forms with which Frederick took up the kingship showed that\r\nthe fears of his father and the hopes of enlightened men were alike\r\nwithout foundation. It became clear that the philosopher-king, though\r\nhe relieved famine and tempted learned foreigners to Berlin, would not\r\nrevert to the ill-timed pageantry of his grandfather. Nor—though he\r\nfreed the press and restricted to a few cases the use of torture—would\r\nhe anticipate the glory of some Hohenzollern who is still unborn by\r\nfostering a spirit of individual liberty among his people. Impatient\r\nof coronation, which he classed among the “useless and frivolous\r\nceremonies which ignorance and superstition have established,” he\r\nreceived the homage of his subjects by proxy everywhere save in\r\nOst-Preussen, Brandenburg, and Cleve. At Königsberg he paid homage to\r\nthe memory of liberties which his ancestors had crushed, and which he\r\nhad no intention of animating anew. The ceremony at Berlin was made\r\nmemorable by one of his rare displays of feeling. When he appeared on\r\nthe balcony of the Castle and looked down upon the surging crowd in\r\nthe square below, he was so affected that he remained standing many\r\nminutes, silent and buried in thought. Then, recovering himself, he\r\nbowed to the multitude, and rode off to attend a military review.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUROPE 1740\r\n\r\n_G. P. Putnam’s Sons. London, & New York._]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, on his journey to Wesel, his Rhenish capital, that\r\nhe reveals most clearly how the Crown Prince has changed into the\r\nKing. Wilhelmina had found him of late so careless, even so uncivil,\r\na correspondent that the news of his coming to Baireuth prostrated\r\nher with joy. He seemed to her so altered in countenance and developed\r\nin form that, just as after his imprisonment at Cüstrin, she hardly\r\nrecognised him. But a less welcome change was only too perceptible.\r\nWilhelmina found her brother’s caresses forced, his conversation\r\ntrivial, their sister, the Margravine of Ansbach, more favoured than\r\nherself. The remainder of the journey proved that Frederick at least\r\nremained true to the French. At Frankfort he disguised himself for a\r\nflying visit to Strasburg. There his little party put up at an inn,\r\nsent the landlord to invite officers to their table, and visited the\r\ntheatre. The mask was penetrated by a runaway Prussian whose tall\r\nbrother had been kidnapped for the army and who recognised the son of\r\nhis former King. The greatest pleasure of all came last. At Wesel,\r\nbesides dealing with the affair of Herstal, which will be described in\r\nthe next chapter, Frederick for the first time paid homage in person to\r\nVoltaire.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October Wilhelmina visited Berlin, but her brother\r\nwelcomed her coldly. She found abundant proofs that he had become\r\ninscrutable. She describes in her _Memoirs_ how the Queen Mother had\r\nshut herself up, equally astonished and mortified at her complete\r\nexclusion from affairs of State. “Some complained of the little care\r\nhe had to reward those who had been attached to him as prince royal;\r\nothers, of his avarice, which they said surpassed that of the late\r\nKing; others of his passions; others again of his suspicions, of his\r\nmistrust, of his pride, and of his dissimulation.” This criticism\r\nfrom an unwonted quarter may possibly be explained away. It has been\r\nsuggested that the King’s treatment of his sister at Baireuth was due\r\nto the same policy of repelling every possible claimant to influence\r\nhis policy, which may be held to excuse the snubs inflicted upon Dessau\r\nand Schulenburg and the dignified exile of Frederick’s mother and wife.\r\nHis conduct at Rheinsberg, whither Wilhelmina followed him, does not\r\nadmit of the same excuse.\r\n\r\n    “The little spare time that he had,” she complains, “was spent\r\n    in the company of wits or men of letters. Such were Voltaire,\r\n    Maupertuis, Algarotti, and Jordan. I saw the King but seldom.\r\n    I had no ground for being satisfied with our interviews. The\r\n    greater part of them was spent either in embarrassed words of\r\n    politeness or in outrageous witticisms on the bad state of the\r\n    Margrave’s finances; indeed he often ridiculed him and the\r\n    princes of the empire, which I felt very much.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SILESIAN ADVENTURE, 1740–1742\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of Frederick in 1740, trivial as some of them are,\r\nreveal him as a statesman, just as the events of 1730 revealed him as a\r\nman. They therefore possess an interest such as hardly any other part\r\nof his reign can claim. For a few months he is free to choose his own\r\npath in life, guided only by instinct and education. Thus an element\r\nof free-will is present which is to some extent lacking in two notable\r\ncrises of his fortunes—the tragedy of 1730 and the miracle of 1757.\r\nThis year sums up, as it were, the eight and twenty which had gone to\r\nmake Frederick what he was: it shapes his course in the six and forty\r\nthat were to follow.\r\n\r\nIn the story of Prussia, 1740 inevitably suggests comparison with 1640,\r\nwhen the Great Elector likewise stood at the parting of the ways.\r\nThen and for years afterwards the choice had lain between existence\r\nand ruin; now it was between increase by natural growth and perhaps\r\nspeedier increase by speculation. For a century Prussia had seldom\r\ndeparted from a policy of thrift and autocracy at home and opportunism\r\nabroad. Would she now abandon it? Frederick’s early measures showed\r\nthat he intended no sweeping changes in domestic politics. We may\r\ntherefore postpone an examination of the system which he there\r\npursued. For us he is at present only the lord of ninety thousand of\r\nthe best-drilled troops in the world, entangled in no alliances and\r\nhampered by no fears. What choice would be for him the wisest?\r\n\r\nCalm reflection on the situation of Europe in 1740 seems to show that\r\nFrederick’s strength was to sit still. Signs were abundant that the\r\npeace which had prevailed almost from his birth could not endure much\r\nlonger. Apart from the problem of Austria, grave questions had arisen\r\nwhich not even a Walpole and a Fleury could settle otherwise than by\r\nthe sword. France and England, it was felt, would soon resume the duel\r\nwhich the Peace of Utrecht had but interrupted, and would struggle for\r\nprimacy in America and in the world. Spain and England were already at\r\nwar, and Europe knew that the Bourbon Kings of Spain and France, who\r\nwere uncle and nephew, were joined in close alliance. To strike at King\r\nGeorge without crossing the sea France must aim at Hanover, and the\r\nsword of Frederick, the neighbour of Hanover, would be bid for by both\r\nsides. According to the convenient theory then current, a prince could\r\nhire out an army without committing his State to war, so that Frederick\r\nstood to gain much,—money, military glory, experience for his men,\r\nperhaps even territory for his House,—while he need stake nothing save\r\nthat which he had long desired to hazard,—his own life and the lives\r\nof his soldiers.\r\n\r\nA Hohenzollern was the last man in the world to undervalue what he\r\nmight wish to sell. Frederick strove to persuade Europe that in\r\nhim a new and greater Gustavus had appeared. He increased his army\r\nostentatiously and bade his representative at Versailles speak of his\r\nactive and impetuous way of thinking.\r\n\r\n    “You can say,” he continues, “that it is to be feared that this\r\n    increase kindles a fire which may set all Europe in a blaze;\r\n    that it is the way of youth to be adventurous, and that the\r\n    alluring visions of heroic fame may disturb and have disturbed\r\n    the peace of countless nations in the world.”\r\n\r\nThe prospect of acquisitions in the Rhineland seemed first to engage\r\nhis thoughts. In hopes of winning Berg he not only made overtures\r\nto France, but even invited the help of Russia. The fruit of these\r\nnegotiations was small. Their significance, however, is great, since\r\nthey showed that Frederick intended to choose his allies without regard\r\nto the tradition of his House in favour of Austria, and also that he\r\nwould not shrink from favouring Muscovite development by employing\r\nCossacks in Western Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that he bargained in this spirit with foreign\r\nPowers, Frederick compelled his brother Germans to mark the change of\r\naccent which he was introducing into the old language of his House.\r\nBrandenburg had taken up the informal protectorate of the German\r\nProtestants when the Saxon Elector by becoming Romanist (1697) resigned\r\nit. Frederick William devised a safe but effective method of checking\r\nRomanist aggression. If any German prince persecuted Protestants, the\r\nKing of Prussia used forthwith to apply similar oppression to his own\r\npapist subjects. Thus, without stirring from Berlin, he stayed the hand\r\nof persecutors in the distant valleys of the Neckar and the Salzach.\r\nHis son soon proved himself ready to go to greater lengths.\r\n\r\nClaims and counter-claims as to territory had arisen between one\r\nof the great Romanist princes, the Archbishop of Mainz, and the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse-Cassel, the heir of one of the earliest champions\r\nof the Reformation. The former relied on his own troops and on those\r\nof neighbouring bishops, while he also possessed the support of the\r\nEmperor, whose right to judge the case had been challenged by his\r\nopponent. The Landgrave appealed to the King of Prussia and to other\r\nprinces of the Empire. Frederick’s reply was immediate, emphatic,\r\nand successful. “In case of need,” he wrote to his brother-Elector\r\nof Mainz, “we should not know how to refrain from affording to the\r\naforementioned His Dilection the Lord Landgrave William the necessary\r\nprotection and help against unlawful force and disturbance.” At these\r\nwords the hostile coalition—Elector, bishops, and Emperor—melted away.\r\nThe young King, it was apparent, had entered the field of German\r\npolitics with _éclat_.\r\n\r\nEqually peremptory and equally successful was Frederick’s verdict for\r\nhis own claims in a dispute with the Bishop of Liège with regard\r\nto Herstal, a tiny barony lying on the Meuse to the westward of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle. The inhabitants had resisted the officers of his\r\nfather, who would gladly have sold Herstal to Liège, and the Bishop,\r\nwho wished to buy but could not come to terms, had egged them on.\r\nFrederick, scorning the advice of his ministers, resolved to use his\r\nstrength as a giant. From Wesel he sent the following ultimatum to the\r\nBishop:\r\n\r\n    “Cousin! Knowing all the attacks that you have made upon my\r\n    unquestionable rights over my free barony of Herstal, and how\r\n    the seditious men of Herstal have been supported for some\r\n    years in their detestable disobedience to me, I have ordered\r\n    my privy-councillor Rambonnet to visit you on my behalf,\r\n    to demand from you in my name a sincere and categorical\r\n    explanation within the space of two days, whether you wish to\r\n    protect the mutineers of Herstal in their abominable disorder\r\n    and disobedience. In case you refuse, or delay that just reply\r\n    which I demand of right, you will render yourself solely\r\n    responsible before all the world for the consequences which\r\n    your refusal will inevitably bring after it. I am, etc.”\r\n\r\n“This is strong, this is lively,” cried the ambassadors at Berlin when\r\nthey read it; “it is the language of Louis XIV.; it is a beginning\r\nwhich shows what we must expect some day from this prince.” Their\r\nprophecy was to be fulfilled sooner than they anticipated. In the\r\nmeantime the new diplomacy won another triumph. The Bishop made no\r\nreply to the ultimatum and in a week’s time the Prussians, sowing\r\napologies broadcast over Europe, seized his county of Hoorn. The\r\napologies concluded with the assertion: “His Majesty will never put\r\nfrom him a just and reasonable arrangement with the said prince, as\r\nthe sole end which his justice and moderation have in view in this\r\naffair, these two invariable principles being the pole-star of all\r\nhis actions.” The “just and reasonable arrangement” proved to be the\r\npayment of two hundred thousand thalers to the King.\r\n\r\nFrederick could therefore congratulate himself that within five months\r\nof his accession he had taught both Prussia and Europe that he was\r\nstronger than his father. It was clear that he was resolved not to\r\nbe hoodwinked by man or woman. He had rejected the advice of his\r\ncautious ministers with the pleasantry that when they spoke of war they\r\nresembled an Iroquois talking of astronomy. The event had gone far\r\ntowards silencing the taunt of Europe that “the Prussians never shoot,”\r\nand towards establishing the truth of Frederick’s well-known simile,\r\n“The Emperor is an old phantom of an idol and has no longer any nerves.”\r\n\r\nA king of Prussia with such a spirit as Frederick had already shown\r\nwas not likely to rest long upon his oars. But it was chance that\r\ndetermined the course that he was next to steer. The Herstal treaty,\r\nwhich confirmed his second diplomatic victory, was signed on October\r\n20th. Six days later a swift courier brought to Rheinsberg the news\r\nthat on that same day the Emperor, Charles VI., had died. Frederick lay\r\nill of fever. He defied his doctors, took quinine, and was well. He\r\nsent for his cautious minister Podewils and for the dauntless soldier\r\nSchwerin, and wrote to Voltaire:\r\n\r\n    “The least expected event in the world forbids me this time\r\n    to open my soul to yours as is my wont.... I believe that in\r\n    June it will be powder, soldiers and trenches rather than\r\n    actresses, ballets and theatres.... This is the moment of the\r\n    entire transformation of the old system of politics: the stone\r\n    is loosed which Nebuchadnezzar beheld when it rolled upon the\r\n    image of four metals and destroyed it.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later he expressed himself with still greater confidence: “I\r\nam not going to Berlin, a trifle like the Emperor’s death does not\r\ndemand great commotions. All was foreseen, all was thought out in\r\nadvance. So it is only a question of carrying out designs which I have\r\nlong had in my mind.”\r\n\r\nThese designs were, in brief, so to use the political situation created\r\nby the death of Charles VI. as to add to Prussia the whole, or at\r\nleast the north-western part, of the Hapsburg province of Silesia—the\r\nfertile basin of the upper Oder. In conception and in execution the\r\nidea was Frederick’s own. It is the pediment of his fame as a hero of\r\nhis nation. All the world knows that the capture of Silesia converted\r\nFrederick the Second into Frederick the Great. It is therefore\r\nimperative that at this point, with judgment unclouded by the smoke of\r\nbattle and the incense of victory, we should address ourselves to the\r\ndouble enquiry, Was it necessary? and Was it right? postponing but not\r\nevading the further question, Was it wise?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RATHHAUS IN BRESLAU.\r\n\r\nFROM A STEEL ENGRAVING.]\r\n\r\nThe plea that Silesia was necessary to Prussia, that the existence of\r\nPrussia could only be prolonged or her people safeguarded or fed if\r\nSilesia were hers, may be dismissed at once. Necessity is the usual\r\npillar of a claim to extend the area of dominion over lands lately\r\nrescued from barbarism. The Law of Nations declares that, when under\r\nsuch conditions two civilised states desire the same territory, one may\r\nfurther its claim by showing that without this addition the territory\r\nwhich it already has would be rendered worthless. But what might give a\r\ngood title to Fashoda would be absurd if applied to Breslau. Frederick\r\nhad himself investigated the subject nine years before when studying\r\nunder Hille at Cüstrin. He then concluded that Silesia did Prussia\r\ncommercial injury by exporting to her goods at lower rates than the\r\nmerchants of Brandenburg could afford to take. This state of things, he\r\nand Hille thought, demanded a protective tariff. It could not by any\r\nstretch of imagination dictate or justify the annexation of a province.\r\nNor from a military point of view was there imperative necessity for\r\nacquiring Silesia. It was no doubt desirable for Prussia that she\r\nshould avert future danger by thrusting a wedge between Saxony and\r\nPoland, and that more than one-fifth of the road from Vienna to Berlin,\r\nby way of Breslau, should be in Prussian hands. But no Prussian could\r\nmaintain in 1740 that if Glogau and Breslau remained Austrian his state\r\nwould be imperilled in the same sense as the German Empire would have\r\nbeen imperilled if Metz and Strasburg had remained French in 1871, or\r\nas the British Empire would be imperilled to-day if Pretoria and\r\nJohannesburg were still in hostile hands. The plea of hereditary right,\r\nnot that of necessity, was put forward by Frederick as the basis of his\r\nclaims. In 1740 the latter would have seemed equally absurd in law and\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\nThe second question, Was it right for Prussia to attempt to acquire\r\nSilesia for her own profit? may seem to have little claim to discussion\r\nby Frederick’s biographers, because considerations of right and wrong\r\ncounted for little with Frederick himself. There seems to be no\r\nevidence that Frederick either in his public or private life practised\r\nthe stale hypocrisies of truth and morality. What it seemed to him\r\nprofitable to do, that he did; what it seemed to him profitable to say,\r\nthat he said. “If there is anything to be gained by being honest, let\r\nus be honest; if it is necessary to deceive, let us deceive,” are his\r\nown words. In the case of Silesia, his avowal to Podewils, who urged\r\nthat some legal claim could be furbished up, is sufficiently explicit.\r\nOn November 7th the King writes: “The question of right (_droit_) is\r\nthe affair of the ministers; it is your affair; it is time to work at\r\nit in secret, for the orders to the troops are given.” Two days later\r\nhe received the news of the death of the Empress of Russia, which was\r\nworth more to him than a thousand title-deeds. Russia had no clear\r\nrule of succession, and usually fell into anarchy at the demise of the\r\nCrown. Frederick could therefore strike southward with confidence that\r\nhis flank was safe.\r\n\r\nThe question, Was it right? has, however, a deeper historical interest\r\nthan that involved in the biography of a king of Prussia. Frederick’s\r\nindifference to all right renders it unnecessary to reflect in his\r\ncase upon the spectacle of a good man cheerfully doing evil in the\r\nservice of the State—of Sir Henry Wotton setting out with a jest “to\r\nlie abroad,” or of Cavour exclaiming, “If we did for ourselves what we\r\ndo for Italy, what scoundrels we should be!” But it is to be borne in\r\nmind that in 1740 it was impossible to lay down with certainty the duty\r\nof a state towards its neighbours. The standard of right and wrong for\r\nstates in their dealings with one another was not yet fixed. Nearly a\r\nquarter of a century later it was possible for Frederick to write, “The\r\njurisprudence of sovereigns is commonly the right of the stronger.” But\r\nMaria Theresa was taught that sovereigns must rule their peoples as\r\nbranches of one Christian family.\r\n\r\nHitherto the old idea that a state was the property—the estate—of the\r\nking had not lost all its influence. Even in England, which was already\r\nthe leader of the world in politics, the dynasty elected by the nation\r\nhad great weight in determining foreign policy. Without the knowledge\r\nof any Englishman, William III. had committed England to the partition\r\nof Spain, and in defiance of most Englishmen George II. was soon to\r\ncommit her to the defence of the Pragmatic Sanction. But if England\r\nwas not yet wholly free from the ancient notion, much more did Austria\r\nand Prussia, bundles of Hapsburg and Hohenzollern lands, resemble the\r\nestates of their rulers.\r\n\r\nFrom this two consequences followed, vital in that day, almost\r\nincomprehensible in ours. It was, in the first place, a maxim\r\nuniversally accepted among the rulers of the Continent that the\r\ninhabitants of a province had little or no share in choosing their\r\noverlord. They might possess rights, even the right not to be divided\r\nbetween several lords, but they could be sold or exchanged or given\r\naway by one overlord to another without their own desire or even\r\nconsent. This maxim was accepted to the full by both Hapsburgs and\r\nHohenzollerns, whose fortunes had been made by the union of family\r\nestates, and who never hesitated to barter those estates to advance\r\ntheir own fortunes. Thus the fact that a province would be happier\r\nunder an overlord who professed the same religion with itself would,\r\naccording to the ideas prevalent in 1740, afford no good reason for\r\nchange. Religious oppression by a ruler, it was universally admitted,\r\nentitled other rulers to interfere. But religious differences between\r\nruler and ruled gave no such right.\r\n\r\nIn so far, then, as States still resembled estates, the relations\r\nbetween them varied according to the personal character of their\r\nkings and princes. The nation ruled by an honourable king observed\r\nits engagement strictly, at whatever inconvenience to itself. If a\r\nState evaded its engagements the king’s honour was held to have been\r\ntarnished. Unfortunately for Europe, this theory had been shaken, if\r\nnot shattered, by the reign of Louis XIV. The Apollo of France, the\r\ncynosure of the Christian world, the king who was the very fount of\r\nhonour and in person the very pattern of chivalry, had in his dealings\r\nwith the Dutch and the Germans shown himself a kinsman of Machiavelli\r\nand of Bismarck. His conspicuous severance of political from personal\r\nmorality shook the faith of the world, and in the corrupt generation\r\nwhich followed Louis XIV. and nurtured Frederick even the standard of\r\npersonal morality sank low.\r\n\r\nAt the death of Charles VI., therefore, men were perplexed about\r\nthe source of law as between State and State. It seemed no longer\r\nsufficient to trust in princes, and yet what new code could be set up?\r\nFrederick’s attack upon Silesia struck a deadly blow at the remnant of\r\nthe old system. His whole career was to influence the new profoundly.\r\n\r\nIn answer to our two first questions it would therefore appear that the\r\nattack upon Silesia was not dictated to Frederick by hard necessity,\r\nand that, tried by the old standard of honour between princes, it was\r\nclearly wrong. The third question—Was it wise?—is of a different order,\r\nfor it is far from certain that the wisdom or folly of Frederick’s\r\nact has been sufficiently tested by time. A safe step towards the\r\ntruth, indeed, is to examine the international situation and calculate\r\nFrederick’s chances of success, as a statesman would compute them\r\nfrom the facts which lay before him in 1740. First of all, however,\r\nwe must account for the fact that Frederick, who was only the third\r\nHohenzollern to wear a crown, found himself in a position to assail the\r\ndynasty which had held for centuries the foremost place in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe House of Hapsburg, perhaps to a greater extent than any other of\r\nthe ruling families in Europe, lay under the spell of its own past.\r\nThis was due in part to its native pride and sluggish blood, in part\r\nto its long association with the oldest and most dignified institution\r\nof the Christian world—the Holy Roman Empire. From 1438 onwards the\r\ndescendants of Rudolf of Hapsburg had been chosen in unbroken sequence\r\nto fill the office which entitled its possessor to style himself Lord\r\nof the World. The radiance of old Rome had gilded Vienna for so long a\r\ntime that it seemed to have transfigured the race that reigned there.\r\nThus the Hapsburgs grew proud with a pride which no other House could\r\nrival, and no Hapsburg was prouder than Charles VI., the Anglo-Austrian\r\ncandidate in the War of the Spanish Succession. His pride was fatal,\r\nfor it banished him from the world of fact. He could never comprehend\r\nhow Europe could leave off fighting to make him King of Spain, nor\r\nhow the King of Prussia, who served him with towel and basin as Grand\r\nChamberlain of the Empire, could cherish aims and aspirations which\r\nconflicted with his own. Pompous ceremonies and parchments made up\r\nso large a part of his own life that he came to believe that they\r\nexpressed realities. Hence he made the cardinal error of his life. He\r\ncommitted the future of his House to the Pragmatic Sanction. Domestic\r\neconomy was beneath his notice. While Frederick William was crying\r\nout because his son’s tutors permitted an item “for the housemaids\r\nat Wusterhausen,” to appear in the accounts, dishonest stewards were\r\ndebiting the Emperor with twelve buckets of the best wine for the\r\nEmperor’s bath and two casks of old Tokay for Her Majesty’s parrots.\r\nWhen Charles VI. died the treasury was almost empty; the army seemed\r\nto have passed away with Prince Eugene; the ministers were blunderers\r\nof seventy and the sovereign a woman of twenty-three.\r\n\r\nMaria Theresa had, however, much in her favour. Though untried in\r\naffairs of State, it was certain that her birth, her beauty, her piety,\r\nher courage, her wifely devotion, and her unfailing goodness of heart\r\nwould win the affection of her subjects. And the realm of the Hapsburgs\r\nneeded only loyalty to be strong. Its broad and smiling provinces could\r\nfurnish inexhaustible supplies of men and food, and the rank and file\r\nhad proved their courage in a hundred wars. Besides, after all the\r\ntrouble and sacrifices of Charles VI., in what quarter could immediate\r\ndanger arise? The rulers of Bavaria, Saxony, Spain, and Sardinia had\r\neach a claim to some part of his inheritance, but they could each and\r\nall be confuted or bought off. A miscellaneous empire like that of the\r\nHapsburgs could never be wholly free from such disputes. What might\r\nwell give confidence for the future was the fact that France, so long\r\nthe moving spirit of Europe and the implacable foe of Austria, had in\r\n1738 given to the Pragmatic Sanction the most ample guarantee that\r\nthe wit of man could devise. What her king had then undertaken, her\r\nall-powerful minister had lately confirmed. In January, Fleury had\r\nwritten to the Emperor:\r\n\r\n    “The King will observe with the most exact and inviolable\r\n    fidelity the engagements which he has made with you, and if\r\n    I may speak of myself after a name so worthy, I venture to\r\n    flatter myself that my pacific intentions are well enough known\r\n    for it to be supposed that I am very far from thinking of\r\n    setting Europe on fire.”\r\n\r\nBoth King and Cardinal were sincere, and the best proofs of their\r\nsincerity were the signs of coming strife between them and England.\r\nIt was clearly to the interest of France that they should keep their\r\npledge.\r\n\r\nIf she had nothing to fear from France, Maria Theresa had everything\r\nto hope from Prussia. It is hardly necessary to say that Frederick\r\nWilliam, the devoted vassal of the Emperor, had been among the first to\r\nguarantee the Pragmatic Sanction. His son, so Austrian statesmen might\r\nargue, had to thank the Emperor for protection when he lay in prison,\r\nfor secret supplies of money, for experience in the field, above all\r\nfor admission by way of marriage to the outer circle of the Imperial\r\nfamily itself. Now he expressed himself in terms which convinced the\r\nconsort of the Queen, Francis of Lorraine, that his attitude towards\r\nthe young couple was that of a father. Francis even flattered himself\r\nwith expectations of Prussian support in his candidature for the office\r\nof Emperor. Although the Austrian resident at Berlin wrote towards the\r\nend of October, 1740, that the gossips spoke of dangerous designs upon\r\na portion of Silesia, and although, on November 19th, Maria Theresa\r\ngave utterance to a fear that the price of Prussian protection would\r\nbe a slice of her hereditary dominions, still no one at Vienna had the\r\nleast suspicion of the blow that Frederick was preparing.\r\n\r\nWhat was hidden from the victims was hidden also from Europe and\r\nfrom Berlin. Till the end of November, the only clear fact was that\r\nPrussia was arming fast. Envoys besieged Podewils and the King, and\r\neven Voltaire journeyed to Rheinsberg in the hope of piercing the\r\nveil. All their efforts were vain. The conviction that Silesia was\r\nin danger gathered strength, but no one could be sure that Frederick\r\nwould move at all, or that if he moved it would not be towards the\r\nRhine. He astutely feinted in the direction of Berg by strengthening\r\nthe garrisons in Cleves and repairing the roads to the West. At the\r\nsame time he toiled hard to baffle official curiosity at home and\r\nabroad and to feel the pulses of the Powers, especially that of France.\r\nWilhelmina, who saw her brother revelling in the social pleasures of\r\nRheinsberg, had no idea of what was in the wind.\r\n\r\nAt last, when secrecy was no longer profitable, the King’s design was\r\nallowed to appear. On November 29th, the English ambassador wrote from\r\nBerlin that the project of invading Silesia was as good as avowed.\r\nFrederick had yet to meet and to brave the Marquis di Botta, who came\r\nfrom Vienna on a special mission to the Prussian Court and encountered\r\nthe stream of troops flowing towards Silesia. At their meeting the King\r\ndropped the mask of friendship. “I am resolved,” he said in effect,\r\n“to safeguard my rights over parts of Silesia by occupying it. Yield\r\nit to me and I will support the throne of Maria Theresa and procure\r\nthe imperial crown for her husband.” “Impossible for us,” urged the\r\nAustrian, “and for you, criminal in the eyes of all Europe.” Argument\r\nwas plainly futile, and both fell to threats. “The Prussian troops make\r\na handsomer show than the Austrian,” said Botta, “but ours have smelt\r\npowder.” “The Prussian troops will prove themselves as brave as they\r\nare handsome,” replied the King. Three days later, on December 12th,\r\nhe attended a masquerade in the apartments of the Queen, questioned\r\nthe French ambassador with regard to the disposition of Fleury, and\r\nafterwards supped in public. To the last moment the routine of pleasure\r\nwas performed.\r\n\r\nNext morning Frederick set out for Silesia. He had first to shake\r\noff two lads of fourteen and ten, his brothers Henry and Ferdinand,\r\nthe youngest colonels in his army, who seized the skirts of his coat\r\nand begged him to take them to the war. A day’s drive brought him to\r\nFrankfurt-on-Oder, and between Frankfurt and the frontier of Silesia\r\nwas encamped an army of 19,000 men with seventy-four guns. The heart\r\nof the despot not yet twenty-nine years old beat high with lust of\r\nadventure and with confidence of success. On the evening of December\r\n16th, he wrote to Podewils from Silesian soil:\r\n\r\n    “I have crossed the Rubicon with waving banners and resounding\r\n    music; my troops are full of good-will, the officers ambitious\r\n    and our generals consumed with greed for fame; all will go as\r\n    we wish and I have reason to promise myself all possible good\r\n    from this undertaking.... I will either perish or have honour\r\n    from it.”\r\n\r\nFrederick’s next step was to issue to the world a document, of which\r\none thousand copies had been printed in deepest secrecy exactly a month\r\nbefore. This was designed to reassure the people of Silesia as to\r\nthe intentions of the King of Prussia. It was dated December 1st and\r\ngave out that a general war was threatening, in which Silesia, “our\r\nsafeguard and outwork,” would be involved and the security of Prussia\r\nthreatened. To avert this peril the King saw himself compelled to\r\ndespatch troops to Silesia.\r\n\r\n    “This is by no means intended to injure Her Majesty of Hungary,\r\n    with whom and with the worshipful House of Austria we rather\r\n    most eagerly desire to maintain the strictest friendship and\r\n    to promote their true interest and maintenance according to\r\n    the example of our glorious forefathers in our realm and\r\n    electorate. That such is our sole intention in this affair,\r\n    time will show clearly enough, for we are actually in course of\r\n    explanation and agreement with Her Majesty.”\r\n\r\nCommentary on this profession, if not sufficiently supplied by\r\nFrederick’s interviews with Botta, was afforded two days after his\r\nentry into Silesia. Then for the first time a Prussian representative,\r\nBorcke, informed the rulers of Austria of his master’s proceedings.\r\nShamefaced and without hope of success, he began the unwelcome task\r\nby offering to the Archduke Francis his master’s guarantee for the\r\nHapsburg lands in Germany, a place in the Prussian alliance with\r\nEngland, Holland, and Russia, his vote at the Imperial election, and\r\na loan of two million florins. Then he named the price—the cession of\r\nall Silesia. “Rather the Turks before Vienna,” cried the Archduke,\r\n“rather the Netherlands to France, rather any concession to Bavaria and\r\nSaxony.” And when he grew calmer and spoke of negotiation, the door\r\nopened and Maria Theresa asked whether her husband was there.\r\n\r\nNext day the subject was broached anew by a more Olympian\r\nplenipotentiary, Oberhofmarschall Gotter, who had arrived after\r\nBorcke’s message was made known. He found Vienna stirred to its depths\r\nand the English ambassador declaring that if such a thing were done\r\nFrederick would be excommunicated from the society of Governments. None\r\nthe less he took the high tone and strove to intimidate the pliable\r\nArchduke.\r\n\r\n    “‘I bear,’ he said, ‘in one hand safety for the House of\r\n    Austria and in the other, for Your Highness, the Imperial\r\n    crown. The treasures of the King my master are at the service\r\n    of the Queen, and he brings her the succour of his allies,\r\n    England, Holland and Russia. As a return for these offers and\r\n    as compensation for the peril which he incurs by them, he asks\r\n    for all Silesia, and will take no less. The King’s resolve is\r\n    immovable. He has the will and the power to possess himself\r\n    of Silesia, and if it be not offered to him with a good grace\r\n    these same troops and treasures will be given to Saxony and\r\n    Bavaria, who are asking for them.’”\r\n\r\nGotter’s words seem to strike the keynote of the Silesian adventure.\r\nHis silence as to legal claim throws into strange relief the\r\npreposterous character of the moral claim which he advances. Saxony and\r\nBavaria had made no overtures to Frederick, and Frederick, as soon\r\nbecame apparent, was willing to accept much less than the whole of\r\nSilesia. The spirit of Maria Theresa breathed in the calm and dignified\r\nreply of the Archduke. Her high-minded confidence in Providence, her\r\nallies, her people, and herself blunted all the weapons of Prussia—the\r\nthreats and cajolings addressed to the sovereign and the three hundred\r\nthousand thalers offered to the ministers. Austria declared that\r\nthe invasion must cease or she would not even negotiate. Thereupon\r\nGotter and Borcke joined their voices to the loud and unceasing chorus\r\nof remonstrance with which Prussia and Europe assailed the ears of\r\nFrederick in vain.\r\n\r\nThe young King’s firmness may be ascribed in part to an overweening\r\nconfidence in his own talents and in part to the favourable progress of\r\nhis enterprise. He knew himself to be a cleverer man than his father\r\nand he had boundless faith in prompt and decided action. His success\r\nin the affairs of Mainz and Herstal could not but have augmented his\r\nself-esteem. The sight of the well-found and eager army which a word\r\nfrom him had assembled filled him with a sense of omnipotence. He\r\ndeclared that it must not be said that the King of Prussia marched with\r\na tutor at his elbow. The minister of France, who admitted his great\r\npower of becoming what he wished, smiled maliciously at what he wished\r\nto become.\r\n\r\n    “Fully convinced of his superiority in every department, he\r\n    already thinks himself a clever statesman and a great general.\r\n    Alert and masterful, he always decides upon the spot and\r\n    according to his own fancy. His generals will never be anything\r\n    but adjutants, his councillors anything but clerks, his\r\n    finance-ministers anything but tax-gatherers, his allies among\r\n    the German princes anything but his slaves.”\r\n\r\nFrederick’s whole career is a vindication of this estimate.\r\n\r\nAlready, both in Silesia and in Europe, good progress had been made.\r\nNo Austrian armies disputed Frederick’s advance, for Charles VI’s\r\ngrandiose projects had denuded his home provinces of troops. The\r\nnatural defences of Silesia, too, were all on the wrong side. Mountains\r\nformidable though by no means impassable screened it from loyal Bohemia\r\nand loyal Moravia, and thus blocked the direct paths to Vienna. Only\r\na few hills and streams barred an attack from the side of Saxony and\r\nno natural obstacle intervened between Breslau and Berlin. The strong\r\nportal looking towards Prussia was Glogau, which closed the Oder, the\r\ngreat natural highway of Silesia. Breslau, the capital, a city which\r\nFrederick could praise as the finest in Germany, was too big to be a\r\nfortress by nature and too independent to be made one by art. In the\r\nmain Protestant, and therefore ill-disposed towards Austrian rule,\r\nit stood firmly upon its right to provide for its own defence and\r\nrefused to receive a garrison. Glogau was therefore the only formidable\r\nfortress in Lower Silesia, the half of Silesia where Protestant feeling\r\nwas strongest and which was most exposed to the Prussian invasion. The\r\nsouth-eastern half, Upper Silesia, contained two other strong places\r\nof high importance—Brieg, which commanded the upper Oder, and Neisse,\r\nwhich secured the backdoor of the province towards Austria. But Glogau,\r\nBrieg, and Neisse were all ill-supplied and undermanned. Without a\r\nfield army to use them as bases and supports they could not oppose a\r\nserious obstacle to the army of the King.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOARD OF FINANCES AT NEISSE.\r\n\r\nFROM A STEEL ENGRAVING.]\r\n\r\nFrederick’s worst foe, indeed, was the weather, which tested the\r\nendurance of the Prussians and found it great. Torrents of rain fell\r\nfrom the eighteenth of December to the twentieth.\r\n\r\n    “Waters all out,” says Carlyle of the latter day, “bridges\r\n    down, the country one wild lake of eddying mud. Up to the knee\r\n    for many miles together; up to the middle for long spaces;\r\n    sometimes even up to the chin or deeper, where your bridge was\r\n    washed away. The Prussians marched through it, as if they had\r\n    been slate or iron.... Ten hours some of them were out, their\r\n    march being twenty or twenty-five miles; ten to fifteen was the\r\n    average distance come.”\r\n\r\nTheir unshaken discipline was the trophy of Frederick William and the\r\nbest omen for the adventure of his son. On December 22d he knocked at\r\nthe door of Silesia and was not dismayed at finding it shut. Wallis,\r\nthe Governor of the province, had thrown himself into Glogau, had\r\nworked manfully to make it defensible, and now stood firm. Without\r\nsiege-guns Frederick could hardly hope to take the place, and for a\r\nfew days his own command was brought to a standstill. He summoned the\r\nreserve under the younger Prince of Anhalt-Dessau to join him at\r\nGlogau and used the delay to organise a system by which Silesia should\r\nfeed his troops for the future, but should feed them with the minimum\r\nof inconvenience and waste. Meanwhile the enterprise continued to be\r\nfortunate. On December 27th Schwerin and the right wing surprised\r\nLiegnitz, an industrial town within sight of the western wall of\r\nmountains, and on the same day the Young Dessauer brought the reserve\r\nto Glogau and set Frederick free. “Thou wilt shortly see Silesia ranked\r\nin the list of our provinces,” wrote the King. “Religion and our brave\r\nsoldiers will do the rest.”\r\n\r\nIn Silesia and in Europe alike the philosopher-king counted much on\r\nreligion. He cheerfully accepted the rôle of Protestant hero assigned\r\nhim by the people, first of Berlin, then of Silesia, and finally of\r\nEngland. Never was this rôle more serviceable than in his dealings with\r\nBreslau. Leaving the Young Dessauer to blockade Glogau, he pressed on\r\nto the capital and, aided by the frost, accomplished the journey of\r\nseventy miles in three days. Much display of friendship and a little\r\nsharp practice sufficed to win the city, and Frederick, gracious and\r\ndebonair, entered it in great state. Thus in three weeks from his\r\ndeparture from Berlin the King destroyed the Austrian civil government\r\nof Silesia. Half the province lay almost passive in his grasp, and he\r\nhad secured a base for the conquest of the other half.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the month of January, 1741, was spent in pressing\r\nhome the advantage already won. The smaller towns, Ohlau, which would\r\nbe useful as a base till Brieg could be acquired, Ottmachau, and\r\nNamslau, capitulated one by one. It was true that the activity of the\r\nyoung Austrian general, Browne, produced an ever-increasing disposition\r\nto resist, and that Glatz, hedged in by hills, defied the besiegers.\r\nBut the area under Prussian control was steadily increased. Brieg was\r\nmasked as Glogau had been, and Neisse, after a futile bombardment of\r\nfour days, was treated in the same way. Schwerin was set free to drive\r\nBrowne through the mountains into Moravia and to lead the army into\r\nwinter quarters. On the 29th of January, Frederick returned to Berlin\r\nand plunged with zest into the whirlpool of diplomacy which had been\r\nstirred to its depths by his adventure.\r\n\r\nGreat as was his trust in resolute action and in accomplished facts,\r\nhe could not disguise from himself the truth that on one side his\r\ncalculations had broken down. Austria, inspired by a Queen whose high\r\nsoul it was not in Frederick’s power to measure, was not one whit\r\nnearer to compliance with his demands. Russia, as he foresaw, was\r\nlikely to do little to help her, but the action of the Western Powers\r\nwas less easy to calculate. Frederick felt sure of one thing above all\r\nelse—that under no circumstances would France and England be on the\r\nsame side. He therefore devoted himself to the task of winning the\r\nalliance of one and the neutrality of the other.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s simultaneous courtship of two Powers whose latent enmity\r\nto each other was beginning to reappear throws valuable light on his\r\ndiplomatic methods and upon his regard for the truth.\r\n\r\n    “A veracious man he was, at all points,” says Frederick’s\r\n    greatest biographer; “not even conscious of his veracity; but\r\n    had it in the blood of him; and never looked upon ‘mendacity’\r\n    but from a very great height indeed. He does not, except where\r\n    suitable, at least he never should, express his whole meaning,\r\n    but you will never find him expressing what is not his meaning.\r\n    Reticence, not dissimulation.... Facts are a kind of divine\r\n    thing to Frederick; much more so than to common men; this is\r\n    essentially what Religion I have found in Frederick.”\r\n\r\nBy his verdict that Frederick was a “veracious” man and his seizure of\r\nSilesia a righteous act, Carlyle robs the story of his life of half its\r\nvalue. The plain meaning of the facts which he adduces seems to be that\r\nhe was an astute man, careless of truth and right. Hence we may enquire\r\nwith keen interest, How far can such means lead to lasting success?\r\nIn deference to a great name, however, two of Frederick’s letters may\r\nbe placed side by side. It will then be unnecessary to recur to this\r\nungracious topic. From this time forward it will be assumed that the\r\nreader has formed his own opinion of Frederick’s truthfulness.\r\n\r\nSo soon as he realised that his negotiation with Austria might break\r\ndown, Frederick turned to France. On January 5, 1741, he wrote to\r\nFleury from Breslau:\r\n\r\n    “My dear Cardinal, I am deeply impressed by all the assurances\r\n    of friendship which you give me and I will always reply to them\r\n    with the same sincerity. It depends only upon you, by favouring\r\n    the justice of my title to Silesia, to make eternal the bonds\r\n    which will unite us. If I did not make you a sharer in my plans\r\n    at first it was through forgetfulness rather than for any other\r\n    reason. It is not everyone who is as unfettered amid his work\r\n    as yourself, and to Cardinal Fleury alone is it granted to\r\n    think of and to provide for everything.”\r\n\r\nAnd in sending the letter he added:\r\n\r\n    “I ask nothing better than a close union with His Most\r\n    Christian Majesty, whose interests will always be dear to me,\r\n    and I flatter myself that he will have no less regard for mine.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time he was making proposals for a close union with the\r\nnatural enemy of France. In the same month, January, 1741, he addressed\r\nthe following sentences to George II.:\r\n\r\n    “My Brother! I am delighted to see that I have not deceived\r\n    myself in placing confidence in Your Majesty.\r\n\r\n    “As I have had no alliance with anyone I have not been able\r\n    to open my mind to anyone; but as I see Your Majesty’s good\r\n    intentions I regard you as already my ally, from whom I ought\r\n    in future to have nothing secret or concealed. Far from\r\n    desiring to disturb Europe, I demand only that heed be paid\r\n    to the justice of my uncontestable rights. I place unbounded\r\n    confidence in Your Majesty’s friendship and in the common\r\n    interests of Protestant princes, which require that those\r\n    oppressed for their religion should be succoured. The tyranny\r\n    under which the Silesians have groaned is frightful, and the\r\n    barbarity of the Catholics towards them inexpressible. If the\r\n    Protestants lose me they have no other resort.\r\n\r\n    “If Your Majesty desires to attach to yourself a faithful ally\r\n    of inviolable constancy, this is the time: our interests, our\r\n    religion, our blood is the same, and it would be sad to see\r\n    ourselves acting against each other: it would be still more\r\n    grievous to oblige me to concur in the great plans of France,\r\n    which I intend to do only if I am compelled.”\r\n\r\nThe question of alliances was still unsettled on February 19th, when\r\nFrederick again left Berlin for the scene of war. Prussia might be\r\ndoomed to act alone; her safety lay in her own right hand. New armies\r\nwere set on foot, but a skirmish at Baumgarten, in which he narrowly\r\nescaped capture, proved to Frederick that the Austrians were moving\r\nand that his own troops were not all that could be desired. Nor was\r\nthe Prussian strategy above criticism. The Old Dessauer, the father of\r\nthe army, held up his hands in horror at the dispositions of Schwerin.\r\nWeak detachments were cantoned everywhere and the mountain-passes not\r\nsecured, although Neisse, Brieg, and Glogau were still Austrian, and\r\nthe Prussians would be at the mercy of an army entering Silesia from\r\nthe Bohemian side.\r\n\r\nBut soon the King’s spirits, which had been depressed by the danger\r\nof a European coalition against him, were raised and the military\r\nsituation greatly improved by a brilliant feat of the Young Dessauer.\r\nGlogau, Frederick had been pleased to decree, must be taken. At\r\nmidnight on March 8th-9th, therefore, a combined assault was made with\r\nthat perfect organisation and cool courage which already distinguished\r\nthe Prussian infantry. In an hour the work was done, at a speed\r\nwhich made the loss on each side the merest trifle. Frederick could\r\ncongratulate his lieutenant on “the prettiest military stroke that has\r\nbeen done in this century,” and himself on the acquisition of an open\r\nhighroad to Breslau. The capital now became a safe central storehouse\r\nfor the Prussians, and its value as a base of operations was greatly\r\nenhanced by the gain of control over the Oder. So far as Glogau itself\r\nwas concerned, it may be convenient to remark that the work had never\r\nto be done a second time. In a wall near the northern portal may be\r\nseen a stone inscribed F. R. 1741—a token of Prussian sovereignty which\r\nfrom that day to this has suffered no erasure.\r\n\r\nThe next task was to secure Neisse, the Glogau of Upper Silesia. The\r\nproblem was complicated by the fact that the Austrians had succeeded\r\nin flinging a thousand men into the fortress, and that a relieving\r\narmy under Marshal Neipperg was known to be on its way from Vienna.\r\nFrederick therefore determined to turn the blockade into an active\r\nsiege, while one covering army was established to the westward., and\r\nSchwerin received orders to concentrate another to the south-east. The\r\ndetachments were being called in for this purpose when the King had to\r\nacknowledge a surprise which led to the first pitched battle of the\r\nwar and which might have ruined his whole enterprise. While Schwerin\r\nwas carefully shutting the south-eastern gate of Silesia in Neipperg’s\r\nface, the marshal passed him on his right and, by a creditable march\r\nover roads supposed to be impracticable, arrived at Neisse on April\r\n5th. The advantage of this bold move was soon apparent. Frederick and\r\nSchwerin, who had been within an ace of capture, were also marching\r\nnorthwards, but they were separated from their friends by the river\r\nNeisse and by a superior force of the enemy. Neipperg was strong in\r\ncavalry and longed to follow up his advantage by crushing the Prussians\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\nFrederick was saved, however, by Neipperg’s ignorance of the strength\r\nand position of his foes. With a force of less than sixteen thousand\r\nmen, the marshal’s plain duty was to use his temporary superiority\r\nin numbers by meeting the enemy in the field and striving to destroy\r\nhim. Failing in this, he might make for Ohlau and the magazine. But\r\nafter crossing the Neisse, he lost touch with Frederick’s force\r\nand believed himself to be between hostile armies on the north and\r\nsouth-east. Snow and rain hampered his movements and chilled his men.\r\nHe therefore abandoned the initiative, and on April 9th sat down within\r\nsight of friendly Brieg to await events. He was right in supposing\r\nthat a Prussian force lay to the south-east of him. It was the army\r\nof Frederick and Schwerin, which had received reinforcements from\r\nall sides. It was three times as strong as he believed it could be,\r\nand it was within five miles of his camp. He was wrong, however, in\r\nsupposing that a stronger force lay to the north in Ohlau. Ohlau was\r\nweak and Frederick was hastening thither to save his heavy artillery\r\nand magazine. Neipperg lay right across his path and a battle was\r\ninevitable. It would soon be proved whether the Prussian troops were\r\nindeed as brave as they were handsome, or whether Europe was right in\r\nthinking that Prussia would pay dear for the presumption of her King.\r\n\r\nFrederick realised the importance of the crisis. For two days, it is\r\nsaid, he could neither eat nor sleep. On April 8th he wrote to his\r\nbrother and heir, Prince Augustus William, bidding him farewell if the\r\nnext day should be his last. In that event he commended to his care\r\nfour of his friends, “those whom in life I have loved the most,” as\r\nwell as two of his servants. The next day, however, proved tempestuous\r\nand the Prussian attack was postponed till April 10th. Then the morning\r\nsun shone out upon a plain hardened by frost and covered to a depth of\r\ntwo feet with snow. The Prussian baggage was packed at five o’clock,\r\nand by nine the whole force had silently taken rank. An hour later,\r\nthe march northward began, the army pressing slowly through the snow\r\ntowards Ohlau, and feeling for the enemy who lay across their path. At\r\nlast the vanguard surprised an Austrian outpost, captured twenty men,\r\nand learned that Neipperg lay encamped in and about Mollwitz, a village\r\nless than two miles ahead.\r\n\r\nHow twenty-two thousand men could have approached so close to the\r\nenemy unperceived, it is hard to understand. Neipperg, it is true,\r\ndid not expect to be attacked. There was some screen of woods between\r\nthe Prussians and Mollwitz, and the country-folk were Protestants who\r\nvolunteered information only to the Prussians. But the day was clear\r\nand the scene as flat as the parade-ground at Potsdam; the Austrians\r\nwere particularly well supplied with scouts and their general’s\r\navowed plan was to shape his course according to the movements of his\r\nopponents. None the less it was in fact not till after ten o’clock\r\nthat he received the alarm, and by that time the Prussians were\r\nmethodically ranking themselves for battle. Had the same opportunity\r\ncome to Frederick later in life, he would, as he himself declares, have\r\nflung troops upon Mollwitz and the neighbouring villages and put the\r\nAustrians to flight before they could form. But in this first fight\r\nevery traditional precaution was carefully observed, “the faithful\r\napprentice-hand,” says Carlyle, “still rigorous to the rules of the old\r\nshop.”\r\n\r\nWhile Neipperg was bustling and hurrying to collect his army from three\r\nvillages and to draw it up in front of Mollwitz, the Prussians were\r\nmanœuvring into place as though they were on parade. Two long lines\r\nwere formed across the plain. These were three hundred paces apart, so\r\nthat if the front were pierced, which was hardly supposed possible, the\r\nrear could fire their flintlocks without massacring their comrades.\r\nHeavy guns to the front, cavalry on the wings, were the orders, and,\r\nas the enemy were superior in cavalry, Frederick copied an expedient\r\nof the great Gustavus by placing two regiments of grenadiers between\r\nthe squadrons of horse on either wing. At length all was ready, and at\r\nmidday the Prussian cannonade began, galling the Austrian cavalry and\r\nas yet unanswerable by the Austrian guns.\r\n\r\nNeipperg had ordered the cavalry to wait till a general advance could\r\nbe made. But the left wing, refusing to be shot down like dogs,\r\nsuddenly defied their officers and dashed at the Prussian right. They\r\nlost all formation, but they found a foe unschooled in their tactics.\r\nFirst pistol-shot, then a stroke with a sabre as sharp as a razor right\r\nat the head of the enemy’s horse, finally, as horse and man went down,\r\na thrust from the rear at the rider—such an attack was beyond the\r\nexperience of the Prussian cavalry, and they could not stand against\r\nit. As often as Austrian horse met Prussian on the day of Mollwitz they\r\ngained an easy victory. They captured some of the guns, plundered the\r\nbaggage, tore several gaps in the line, and drove the King himself in\r\nheadlong flight from his first battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF MOLWITZ, APRIL 10, 1741.]\r\n\r\nFor some time Frederick was driven helplessly here and there amid his\r\nruined cavalry in a fight which was unlike anything that he had ever\r\nseen and which he was impotent to control. His generals begged him to\r\nquit the field. To his inexperienced eye all seemed lost, and at last\r\nSchwerin confirmed his fears. “There is still hope,” said this tried\r\ncaptain to his sovereign, “but in case of the worst it would be well\r\nif your Majesty in person would bring troops from Ohlau and Strehlen.”\r\nBewildered and despairing, the King turned his back on the wreck of\r\nall his hopes and fled far to the south-east. Distancing many of his\r\nattendants in a swift ride of more than thirty miles, he arrived at\r\nOppeln on the Oder, only to be repulsed by the unexpected fire of a\r\nparty of Austrian hussars who had seized the town and who captured some\r\nof his worse-mounted companions. To this check, for he then doubled\r\nback towards his army, he owed the fact that at the close of a ride of\r\nnearly fifty miles he received the news of victory without delay.\r\n\r\nWhen Frederick left the field it was about four o’clock. The havoc in\r\nthe Prussian ranks had been wrought by unsupported charges of horse.\r\nSchwerin could still count upon his infantry, which in the midst of\r\nthe whirlwind had stood firm as a rock and by sheer steadiness and\r\nspeed of firing had tumbled masses of cavalry into ruin. His first act\r\nwas to send to the Young Dessauer, who commanded the second line, an\r\nexhortation to do his duty and to keep his men from firing volleys into\r\nthe backs of their comrades. The Young Dessauer, who hated Schwerin,\r\nreplied that he needed no judge save the King and that he would do his\r\nduty without any reminders.\r\n\r\nAfter this exchange of courtesies, Schwerin braced himself to the\r\ntask of retrieving the day. He assured his infantry that the King was\r\nwell, that no battle could be won or lost by cavalry alone, and that\r\nhe placed his trust in them. He then ordered his right wing forward\r\nagainst the Austrian infantry. These were raw levies and gave signs of\r\nunsteadiness before the Prussians came within range. Range, in days\r\nof weak powder and clumsy muskets, was some forty-five paces, and the\r\nsight of the enemy bearing down upon them, shoulder to shoulder, was\r\ntoo much for undisciplined men to face. Neipperg drew supports from\r\nhis right, but even his victorious cavalry soon refused to face the\r\nfire which was poured in by men perfectly trained and furnished with\r\nthe iron ramrods invented by the Old Dessauer. The Austrian infantry,\r\nwhich was able at the best to fire less than half as fast as the enemy,\r\nhid trembling one behind another and tried to endure a torment to which\r\nthey could not reply. As the sun was sinking Schwerin pressed his\r\nadvantage home. With sounding music and waving banners, in irresistible\r\nadvance, the Prussian left swept down upon the weakened Austrian right.\r\nNeipperg saw that the battle was lost. He retreated first behind\r\nMollwitz then, seeing that his men would not stand, round the Prussian\r\nleft and eventually to Neisse.\r\n\r\nExcept that his magazine was saved and that he was soon able to capture\r\nBrieg, Frederick derived little immediate military advantage from what\r\nhe describes as “one of the rudest battles fought within the memory of\r\nman.” The chief profit of Neipperg’s march had evaporated before the\r\nbattle, at the moment when Frederick and Schwerin became superior in\r\nnumbers. In spite of Mollwitz the Austrian army remained on Silesian\r\nsoil, and it was better placed near Neisse than near Brieg. In killed\r\nand wounded each side had lost about 4500 men, nearly one-fourth of the\r\ncombatants engaged. And in spite of Frederick’s hoarded millions and\r\nwell-filled regiments, it was clear that, if the contest were to remain\r\na duel between himself and Maria Theresa alone, the size and natural\r\nwealth of Austria must tell in the long run. After Mollwitz, Frederick\r\nwould still have been glad to accept Lower Silesia as the price of his\r\nalliance with Austria and a contribution to her exchequer.\r\n\r\nPrussia’s greatest gain from Mollwitz was increase of prestige. Though\r\nher cavalry did not regain their nerve for many a day, her infantry,\r\nthe backbone of the army, had proved that it was indeed as brave as it\r\nwas handsome. Frederick never alluded to his own departure from the\r\nfield. In later life he accustomed himself to inaugurate the Prussian\r\nmilitary year by celebrating the anniversary of the triumph which he\r\nhad not seen. Every fifth of April the Guards were twice ordered to\r\nthe charge and dismissed with the words, “Thus did your forefathers at\r\nMollwitz.” The traditional Austrian contempt for Prussia had received\r\nits first signal rebuke. The story survives among the villagers of\r\nMollwitz that when the call to arms disturbed one of Neipperg’s\r\nofficers at dinner he called to the landlord to keep the dishes hot.\r\n“We will come back soon,” he promised, “but we have to go and dust the\r\nPrussians’ jackets for them.”\r\n\r\nVictory in the field reconciled Prussian opinion to Frederick’s\r\nSilesian adventure, but this was a small gain in comparison with its\r\neffect on opinion in Europe, especially in France. At the Court of\r\nLouis XV. the party opposed to Fleury and to peace had been gathering\r\nstrength day by day. Hot-headed men and women, blind to the true\r\ninterests of their country, could see in Austria only the hereditary\r\nenemy from whom lands and laurels were to be won. Chief among them was\r\nMarshal Belleisle, a man who conceived great schemes and advocated them\r\nwith eloquence and charm. His plan was that France should ally herself\r\nwith Prussia, procure the Imperial crown for Charles Albert of Bavaria,\r\nand, in spite of all her pledges to support the Pragmatic Sanction,\r\nendow both the Bavarian and Saxon claimants with Austrian lands. Having\r\nthus humbled Austria and made the fortunes of Austria’s rivals, France\r\nmight gain the Netherlands and Luxemburg for herself and dictate to a\r\ndivided Germany for ever.\r\n\r\nBefore Mollwitz, Belleisle had progressed with this policy so far as to\r\nbe entrusted with a mission to the Diet which assembled at Frankfort\r\nto elect an Emperor. Frederick’s victory encouraged all the enemies of\r\nthe Hapsburgs and thus lightened the task of Belleisle. In May, 1741,\r\nCharles Albert accepted the rôle marked out for him, and early next\r\nmonth the King of Prussia, despairing of an alliance with England, came\r\nto terms with France. By a treaty signed at Breslau in the deepest\r\nsecrecy, he agreed to renounce his claims to Jülich-Berg, and undertook\r\nto vote for Charles Albert at the Diet. France in return guaranteed\r\nhim in the possession of Lower Silesia, and undertook to safeguard\r\nPrussia by sending an army to support Charles Albert within two months\r\nand by stirring up Sweden to make war on Russia. The coalition against\r\nAustria gathered strength as it proceeded, and with the exception of\r\nthe English and the Dutch no nation hesitated to desert the Pragmatic\r\nSanction.\r\n\r\nThe idea with which Frederick began the Silesian adventure was\r\nat length realised. He had, as he anticipated, stirred up general\r\nconfusion, amid which the strong man who knew his own mind could hardly\r\nfail to carry off some spoils. To France, as the moving spirit, he\r\nwas all gratitude and devotion. But his real design henceforward was\r\nto leave his confederates to subdue Austria, while he himself devoted\r\nall his powers to grasping what Prussia could hope to retain. What he\r\ngained from Belleisle’s work was made manifest in the summer and autumn\r\nof 1741. While the Bavarians and French were advancing in triumph down\r\nthe Danube towards Vienna, the Austrians could take no thought for\r\nSilesia. Frederick, therefore, had leisure to train his cavalry and\r\nconsolidate his conquest. He treacherously destroyed the municipal\r\nindependence of Breslau, which he had bound himself to preserve, but\r\ndid little actual fighting. Neisse, protected by Neipperg’s army,\r\nseemed still too strong to be attacked.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the extreme peril of Maria Theresa’s throne forced the\r\nQueen to make trial of desperate remedies. By throwing herself upon\r\nthe generosity of the Hungarians, the traditional rebels against her\r\nHouse, she more than doubled the force at her disposal. Her endeavour\r\nto purchase France was futile, but a hint from Frederick was now\r\nenough to inaugurate negotiations with Prussia. Early in October\r\nthese issued in the famous convention of Klein Schnellendorf. In deep\r\nsecrecy, for Fleury had written that the King of Prussia was false in\r\neverything, even in his caresses, and the French ambassador kept a\r\nwatchful eye upon his movements, Frederick met Neipperg at a castle\r\nin the neighbourhood of Neisse. Each was accompanied by one companion,\r\nwhile the English ambassador, Lord Hyndford, who had arranged the\r\ninterview, acted as clerk and witness. There Frederick, who had just\r\nwritten to Belleisle a letter full of encouragement, sold his allies\r\nfor his own profit. It was agreed that after a sham siege of Neisse\r\nthe Austrians should evacuate Silesia, and that Prussia should become\r\nneutral in fact though not in show. To Neipperg, whose army would now\r\nbe free to act against the French in Bohemia, Frederick gave wise\r\ncounsel for the campaign. “Unite all your troops, then strike home\r\nbefore they can strike you.” If the Austrians should succeed, Frederick\r\nmight join them; if not, he would be compelled to look to himself. To\r\ndeceive the French, the English ambassador was to report him as deaf to\r\nall propositions. If any word of the convention got abroad, the King\r\ndeclared he would deny all and regard all as void.\r\n\r\nThis conspiracy against Frederick’s allies was punctiliously carried\r\ninto effect so long as it was profitable to Prussia. For fifteen days\r\nNeisse submitted to a bombardment and two hundred cannon-shot were\r\nfired off by either side. After seven days Neipperg’s army made off,\r\nattended by a Prussian corps in seeming pursuit, and at the time\r\nappointed the strong fortress was surrendered. On the very same day\r\nthe King accepted a treaty for the partition of Austria. The Prussians\r\nthen, as arranged, went into winter quarters in Upper Silesia,\r\nwhich Austria was eventually to retain, and from time to time sham\r\nskirmishes took place to hoodwink the French.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of November the King left Neisse for Berlin, pausing\r\non his way to view the scenes of all his triumphs. At Brieg and Glogau\r\nhe inspected the fortifications, but at Breslau he drove in state to\r\nthe grand old Rathaus and received the homage of Lower Silesia, the\r\nprovince secretly ceded to him at Klein Schnellendorf. The ceremony\r\nwas immediately followed by the reorganisation of the Government in\r\nChurch and State. The province was simply made Prussian, with absolute\r\nreligious equality, heavy but not harsh taxation, and a regular system\r\nof conscription.\r\n\r\nAt Klein Schnellendorf Frederick had hinted that if the Austrians were\r\nnot successful in Bohemia they could not expect him to do more than\r\nstand neutral. The event soon showed what he meant. Before the end of\r\nNovember Prague was stormed in brilliant fashion by the Bavarians,\r\nFrench, and Saxons. Frederick’s allies had succeeded where he expected\r\nthem to fail. He at once proclaimed his intention of standing by the\r\nwinning side. “My fingers itch for brilliant and useful action on\r\nbehalf of my dear Elector,” he wrote to Belleisle. He broke all the\r\nprovisions of the convention of Klein Schnellendorf and derided the\r\nsuggestion that such a pact could ever have existed. “Should I be\r\nso foolish as to patch up a peace with enemies who hate me in their\r\nhearts, and in whose neighbourhood I could enjoy no safety?” the King\r\ndemanded. “The true principles of the policy of my House demand a\r\nclose alliance with France.” Such was the substance of the argument\r\nwhich Frederick addressed to Fleury.\r\n\r\nLord Hyndford, however, had witnessed all that passed at Klein\r\nSchnellendorf, and would not allow England to be duped by lies.\r\nFrederick therefore told him frankly that he intended to set the\r\nconvention at defiance. The allies, he showed, had 150,000 men\r\nagainst Austria’s 70,000 and could do with her what they would. If\r\nshe published the convention she would only expose her own folly,\r\nand perhaps she would not be believed. Then, besides treating Upper\r\nSilesia as his own and laying hands on the adjoining county of Glatz,\r\nhe ordered the conquest of Moravia. Ere the year was out Schwerin was\r\nin Olmütz, the chief town of the North, and it seemed as though the\r\nallies would filch yet another province from the Queen. “Alas!” wrote\r\nthe philosopher-king on one occasion to Voltaire, “trickery, bad faith\r\nand double-dealing are the leading feature of most of the men who are\r\nat the head of the nations and who ought to set them an example.”\r\n\r\nNever was the fortitude of Maria Theresa more needed or more\r\nillustrious than in these winter months. The earlier gleams of\r\nlight—Vienna spared and Frederick bought off—only made yet more\r\nblack the clouds which now gathered over her throne. Her father had\r\nflattered himself that he bequeathed to her the support of united\r\nEurope. Within a year of his death the greater part of Europe was\r\nleagued to despoil her. France, Spain, Bavaria, Prussia, Saxony, the\r\nElector Palatine, the Elector of Cologne formed the coalition, and\r\nthe accession of Sardinia was the prelude to a severe struggle on the\r\nside of Italy. The loss of Bohemia almost without a blow made the\r\nQueen well-nigh forgetful of Silesia until the perfidy of Frederick\r\nopened the former wound anew. At the same time a revolution at St.\r\nPetersburg extinguished for the time being the Austrian influence in\r\nRussia and thereby increased the King’s security. Then came the attack\r\nupon Moravia, and before the end of January, 1742, the Imperial crown\r\npassed from the Hapsburg family by the election of the head of a rival\r\nHouse—Charles Albert of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nAmid all these disasters, however, the courage of the young Queen,\r\nrooted as it was in her belief that right must triumph, remained\r\nunshaken. She organised new armies and inspired them with her own\r\nspirit. Before the resurgent might of Austria the new-made Emperor sank\r\ninto impotence. Within a month of his election the Queen recovered her\r\ncities on the Danube and overran the hereditary lands of the Bavarian.\r\n_Et Cæsar et nihil_ laughed the wags. What would his allies, France,\r\nPrussia, and Saxony, do to relieve him?\r\n\r\nThe position of affairs may be simply stated. Two Austrian armies\r\nwere in the field, one conquering Bavaria, the other protecting it\r\nagainst an attack from the side of Bohemia, where the allies were\r\nstill masters of Prague. If this second army were driven back by\r\na superior force, the first would be recalled to support it. Thus\r\nBavaria and Bohemia, the actual and the pretended inheritance of\r\nCharles Albert, would be freed from the Austrians together. At the\r\nsame time the French in Bohemia would be relieved from the fear of\r\nbeing outnumbered and attacked, and the Saxons would have the simplest\r\nmarch possible—straight into Bohemia by the natural highroad of the\r\nElbe. Every military consideration thus summoned Frederick to join in\r\nclearing the kingdom of Austrian troops. But this plan promised no\r\nspecial advantage for the King of Prussia and it opened no market in\r\nwhich he might barter his allies. With infinite labour he therefore\r\nsecured the adoption of another, in which these defects were remedied.\r\nThis was that he should lead the Saxon army into Moravia to assist the\r\nPrussians in conquering the province, and in thus creating a diversion\r\nwhich, he maintained, would aid the Emperor as well as any other.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons reluctantly left their country with no force, save the\r\nFrench, to guard its frontier against the Austrian army of Bohemia.\r\nFrederick was therefore secure against treason on his flank and could\r\nagain stir the waters of politics in full confidence that his House\r\nwould gain some profit. Moravia might become to Silesia what Silesia\r\nhad now become to Brandenburg—a dependency and an outwork. Or if this\r\nwas too much to hope for, he as conqueror of Moravia might at least\r\ndictate to Vienna the surrender of a Silesia augmented by cuttings from\r\nthe Bohemian kingdom, of which Frederick regarded the Emperor or the\r\nQueen as lawful sovereign exactly according to his convenience at the\r\nmoment. At the worst Moravia might pass to the Saxon House, which was\r\na weaker and therefore a safer neighbour than the Hapsburg.\r\n\r\nAll these calculations were falsified by events. The invasion of\r\nMoravia was a far more difficult task than the invasion of Silesia.\r\nInstead of a level and fertile country inhabited in part by Protestant\r\nwell-wishers, Frederick found a rugged desert whose people hated the\r\nPrussians and did them every mischief in their power. He devastated the\r\nland by way of penalty, and dragged the grumbling Saxons through clouds\r\nof guerillas to Brünn, the capital, where he induced them to join him\r\nin a siege. As leader of a composite army, however, he was no longer\r\nserved with the prompt and unquestioning obedience which the unmixed\r\nPrussian forces had displayed.\r\n\r\nBrünn made a stout resistance and Prince Charles was deputed to march\r\nto its relief. At this point the heroism of the Queen seemed to be\r\nrewarded by a sudden change of fortune. Frederick tried once more to\r\nsacrifice his allies to his own profit, but in vain. England, now\r\nguided by Carteret in place of Walpole, was actively supporting Maria\r\nTheresa. Sardinia deserted the coalition against her. At Vienna, men\r\nregained a confidence which was heightened by the news from the North.\r\nPrince Charles feinted against the French in Bohemia and Frederick\r\ndismissed the Saxons to help them. This was but the first step towards\r\nthe abandonment of the whole venture. After a toilsome retreat and\r\ncountless skirmishes, the exhausted Prussians crossed safely into\r\nBohemia before the end of April and again the negotiators were set to\r\nwork. Once more they failed and the Prussians found themselves between\r\nPrague and the army of Prince Charles, which was now making thither\r\nfrom Moravia.\r\n\r\nA conflict was inevitable. It took place at Chotusitz, near the Elbe,\r\nwithin three marches of Prague, on May 17, 1742. This battle is\r\nremarkable not only because seven thousand men fell in three hours, but\r\nalso because it is the first victory actually won by Frederick himself.\r\nHis imperious temper had cost him the services of Schwerin, the hero\r\nof Mollwitz, while the Old Dessauer had been rebuked for disobedience\r\nand sent to the rear. But the Prussian infantry were as steady as at\r\nMollwitz, the cavalry, who suffered terribly, much better, and the\r\nKing proved that he could seize the moment for decisive action on the\r\nfield as well as in the cabinet. Four thousand Prussians fell, but\r\ncasualties, captures, and desertion reduced Prince Charles’s force of\r\nthirty thousand by one-half.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Chotusitz assisted Frederick once more to abandon his\r\nallies. It added force to the diplomacy of England, whose policy\r\nwas to help Austria a great deal against the French, but not at all\r\nagainst the Prussians. While the English ambassadors were urging the\r\nQueen to submit to the loss of Silesia, the Austrian troops pressed\r\nthe French hard in Bohemia and thus forced Frederick to hurry on a\r\npeace. Within four weeks of Chotusitz, victor and vanquished had come\r\nto terms. Frederick withdrew from the war and received all Silesia\r\nexcept a fringe on the south-west, as well as the county of Glatz in\r\nfull sovereignty for ever. On July 28th these terms were embodied in\r\nthe Treaty of Berlin, which closed the First Silesian War. In twenty\r\nmonths, at a cost of two pitched battles, Frederick had added to\r\nPrussia sixteen thousand square miles of fertile land and a million and\r\na quarter of inhabitants—a greater prize than any that his ancestors\r\nhad won. He was not yet thirty-one years of age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND STRUGGLE FOR SILESIA, 1742–1745\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter following Frederick’s career through many phases in a dozen\r\nyears, we observe him with interest as he quits the whirlpool of\r\nforeign adventure for the calm of government at home. We may well\r\nenquire how far three crowded and strenuous campaigns have transformed\r\nour hero. It is impossible that the deeds done at Breslau, Mollwitz,\r\nKlein Schnellendorf, Olmütz, and Chotusitz and the strenuous toil of\r\ntwenty months in departments new to him should have left no mark upon\r\nhimself. The story outlined in the foregoing chapter suggests that he\r\nmoved from place to place and from task to task with great speed and\r\nthat his life, perhaps even his throne, were more than once in danger.\r\nBut it can convey no adequate idea of the inundation of ambassadors,\r\ngenerals, messengers, officials, and busybodies which daily surged\r\nin upon the King. Frederick, it must be remembered, was his own\r\ncommander-in-chief and his own prime minister at a time when, as he\r\nhimself confessed in later years, he had not the least knowledge of\r\nwar, when, owing to his father’s jealous absolutism, he had had the\r\nbriefest possible experience of diplomacy, and when his powers both in\r\nwar and in diplomacy were taxed by the problems of a newly-won province\r\nwhich must be conciliated at all costs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARADE GROUND AT POTSDAM.]\r\n\r\nThe strain was indeed severe. Under it Frederick became more\r\nstatesmanlike but not more humane. After a course of the waters at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, he diverted himself as of old with literature and\r\nthe society of wits. But he made no effort to improve his domestic\r\nlife. His queen had retired to Schönhausen, a modest country-house in\r\nthe dreary plain which lies on the north side of Berlin—a dwelling so\r\nremote that the swift expansion of recent years has not yet brought\r\nit within the city. The King’s thoughts ran already upon a bachelor\r\nestablishment at Potsdam, the Sans Souci of later years, where he\r\nmight escape from the society of his relations to enjoy that of his\r\nfriends. For his subjects he attempted to provide few benefits beyond\r\na codification of the law—little enough for one who had held out hope\r\nof a revolution in the art of kingship. It is true that he built the\r\ngreat Opera House at Berlin, that he lavished money upon actors and\r\nmusicians, and that he endowed an Academy of Sciences. But he made\r\nFrench the only vehicle of learned and literary thought; and though\r\nBerlin might shine in Europe, the Prussian people gained little benefit\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nThe King even enjoyed for a time the society of Voltaire, at that time\r\nthe King of Letters. The transaction is characteristic of the age.\r\nThe brilliant Frenchman, having quarrelled with his peers at home,\r\nobtained from Louis XV. an informal commission to pry into the secrets\r\nof Prussia. Before leaving France, he vented his spleen in a parcel of\r\nepigrams upon Louis and his subjects, which he sent in all secrecy to\r\nhis affectionate admirer, Frederick. The latter, thinking to close the\r\ndoors of France to his guest and so to cage him at Berlin, published\r\nthem all at Paris. Both betrayals failed. As a diplomat Voltaire\r\nextracted only banter from his patron and disciple, while Frederick\r\nfound that Louis XV. was indeed what Voltaire had termed him—“the most\r\nstupid of kings,” for the epigrams did not sting him.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s wider experience of life, it is clear, had rather hardened\r\nhis heart than softened it. As a king he had developed, faster\r\ndoubtless than in time of peace, along the lines with which we are\r\nalready familiar. He was still conspicuously energetic, imperious, and\r\nmercantile. His energy is the more striking by contrast with the habit\r\nof his contemporaries. Philip of Spain was sluggishly obeying his wife.\r\nLouis of France, whom Frederick termed a good man whose only fault was\r\nthat he was King, was toying with mistresses, patronising sieges, and\r\npointing out the faults in a policy which he was too indolent to cheek.\r\nAugustus of Saxony was sacrificing his armies lest he should be late\r\nfor the opera. The Czarina Elizabeth has been described as “bobbing\r\nabout in that unlovely whirlpool of intrigues, amours, devotions, and\r\nstrong liquor, which her history is.” In a word, the princes of Europe\r\nstill in great part looked on their office as an inheritance to be\r\nenjoyed. Meanwhile, the King of Prussia was rising at dawn, reviewing\r\ntroops, inspecting fortresses, drafting and conning despatches,\r\nsuperintending his players, and constituting himself a judge of appeal\r\nfor all his kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhether judge, general, or stage-manager, he was always the King of\r\nPrussia, and his naturally imperious temper mounted higher day by day.\r\nHis stern treatment of the Old Dessauer and the alienation of Schwerin\r\nhave already been mentioned. In time of peace his ministers met with no\r\ngreater forbearance. They were treated at best as clerks, and often as\r\ndogs. The faithful Podewils, who had just rendered priceless services\r\nto his master in the negotiations with Austria, presumed to suggest\r\nthat the King should remain for a time in Silesia. “Attend to your own\r\naffairs, Sir,” was the reply, “and do not presume to dictate whether I\r\nought or ought not to go. Negotiate as I order you, and do not be the\r\nweak tool of English and Austrian impudence.” With the same imperious\r\nbrutality Frederick wrote to the honourable nobleman who represented\r\nhim at Vienna. “Do not forget, Sir, with what master you have to do,\r\nand if you take heed of nothing else, take heed for your head.”\r\n\r\nAs with his dependents, so with states weaker than his own, Frederick\r\nalways played the dictator. To grace his new opera he had engaged the\r\nfamous dancer Barberina, who was then at Venice. Her English lover\r\npersuaded her to break the contract and remain there and the Doge and\r\nSenate professed themselves powerless to interfere. Frederick therefore\r\nseized a Venetian ambassador in Berlin and held him as a hostage, until\r\nthe Venetians in their turn violated justice by sending Barberina a\r\nprisoner to Berlin.\r\n\r\nWith an imperiousness equal to that of his father Frederick combined\r\nthe traditional Hohenzollern willingness to buy and sell. He failed\r\nto buy Silesia, but he succeeded in buying Glatz. The county of Glatz\r\nbelonged to Bohemia, and in 1741 Frederick recognised Charles Albert\r\nas King of Bohemia. From him he purchased territory which the Bavarian\r\nhad never possessed and which he could never hope to possess without\r\nforeign aid. The Prussians conquered the country and in 1742 Maria\r\nTheresa offered to cede it. Thereupon the King accepted from Austria\r\nwhat he had declared to belong to Bavaria and announced that he was no\r\nlonger bound to pay the purchase money agreed upon.\r\n\r\nFrederick seems to be still in all essentials the man whose development\r\nwe have traced from his birth to his accession. He is tougher, as it\r\nwere, in mind and body alike. He has thrown off the feeble health of\r\nhis earlier years and the lust for mere adventure which possessed him\r\nin the twenties. But experience has only added to his trust in himself,\r\nto his belief that “negotiations without arms are music without\r\ninstruments,” that war determines disputes, and that bravery and\r\nleadership determine war. His faith in prompt and decided action was\r\nnever more conspicuous than in 1744, when on the death of its prince\r\nwithout lineal heirs, he seized Eastern Frisia. Hanover also had claims\r\nto the land, but nothing could withstand the speed with which the\r\nPrussians made this miniature Silesia their own and thus acquired in\r\nEmden an outlet on the North Sea.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s schemes are, indeed, so daring, and his acts so swift and\r\ndecisive, that many have believed—as he himself seems to have believed\r\nat the time—that he was gifted with almost superhuman insight and rose\r\nsuperior to human weakness. It may, therefore, be well to cite the\r\nwords in which Professor Koser of Bonn, the greatest living authority\r\nupon the subject, has set down his impression of the King as he was at\r\nthe end of the First Silesian War.\r\n\r\n    “To us he seems neither superhuman nor inhuman, a man not ready\r\n    made and complete, but still in process of growth. The cold\r\n    ‘satanic’ calculator shows himself more than once a sanguine\r\n    man, a man of impulse. Sometimes insolent and sometimes almost\r\n    faint-hearted, he lets his bearing be easily decided by the\r\n    impressions of the moment. In his haste and heat and lack of\r\n    experience he makes plenty of mistakes, not only in war, but\r\n    also in politics. He does not look far into the future, and\r\n    sometimes, however near to his heart lies his good repute, he\r\n    takes no thought for it in time to come. And as he himself\r\n    later admits, he owes a great part of his successes to fortune\r\n    and to chance. In one word, we grant plenty of what the King,\r\n    grown more mature, has described as the ‘giddiness’ of his\r\n    younger years.”\r\n\r\nWhen Frederick, pleading that in shipwreck each must save himself,\r\nforsook his allies in the summer of 1742, he did so with certain\r\ndefinite intentions. He wished to give Prussia time to digest Silesia,\r\nand Europe time to accustom herself to Prussia. “The only question\r\nnow,” he wrote to Podewils, “is to accustom the cabinets of Europe to\r\nsee us in the position which this war has given us, and I believe that\r\nmuch moderation and much good temper towards all our neighbours will\r\nlead to that result.” The words breathe peace, but peace only so long\r\nas it was both safe and profitable for Prussia. “The safety of our new\r\npossessions,” he had just pointed out, “rests on a large and efficient\r\narmy, a full treasury, powerful fortresses and showy alliances which\r\neasily impose upon the world.” For a time, it is clear, the King\r\nintended to revert to the old policy of drilling men and saving money.\r\nBut it seems equally clear that if all went well the question which\r\nFrederick propounded in 1740 would in due course present itself again.\r\n“When one has an advantage is he to use it or not?” Is it reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the conqueror of Silesia would in future answer No?\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, while the Prussian system of government was\r\nbeing established in Silesia, Frederick scanned every rise and fall of\r\nthe political barometer. What he saw made him at first congratulate\r\nhimself on having forsaken a losing cause before it was too late. Early\r\nin September, 1742, the Saxons quitted the war empty-handed, and it\r\nwas evident that France repented of her share in it. Before the end\r\nof the year her troops had been driven out of almost all Bohemia, and\r\nin January, 1743, the death of Fleury deprived her of what unity in\r\npolicy and administration she still possessed. Worse than all else, the\r\nSea Powers now entered vigorously into the war. George II. was anxious\r\nto protect Hanover; Carteret and the English people longed to strike a\r\nblow at their natural enemy, France; and the importunity of England at\r\nlength induced the Dutch to move.\r\n\r\nFrederick, though he had arranged affairs in Russia to his liking, had,\r\ntherefore, every reason to fear lest Austria should grow strong enough\r\nto turn against himself. He was annoyed beyond measure by the news of\r\nKing George’s lucky victory over the French at Dettingen on June 27,\r\n1743. “The devil fly away with my uncle,” he wrote to Podewils. He\r\ndeclared that he would never hear the name of France again. “Noailles\r\nis beaten, and by whom? By people who do not understand how to draw up\r\na line of battle, and who, in fact, did not draw one up.” Frederick’s\r\ndisgust was only increased by the fact that his military criticism was\r\nwell founded. Owing to George’s want of skill, Noailles had caught\r\nhis army in a trap, from which it escaped only by calm courage and\r\ndesperate fighting hand to hand. “I have tolerably well foreseen\r\neverything that has passed in Europe hitherto,” wrote the King of\r\nPrussia, “but for this blow I was not prepared.”\r\n\r\nDettingen and the fear of worse to follow impelled Frederick to take up\r\narms anew. Early in September, 1743, he visited Wilhelmina at Baireuth\r\nand endeavoured in vain to organise a league of German princes to\r\nrescue the Emperor. The Austrian diplomats were more successful. In\r\nthe same month, by a treaty made at Worms, they secured the definite\r\nalliance of England and Sardinia. Frederick noticed with some alarm\r\nthat the Treaty of Berlin, which gave him Silesia, was not treated at\r\nWorms as indispensable to the future of Germany. In December a compact\r\nmore distinctly menacing to Prussia, should she again interfere in the\r\nwar, was concluded between Austria and Saxony.\r\n\r\nEarly in the new year (1744), therefore, Frederick turned unabashed\r\nto France. He offered to join her in a war which both parties should\r\npledge themselves to continue until Bohemia should have been wrested\r\nfrom the Queen. The Emperor was to receive the greater part of the\r\nkingdom, but Prussia, as in 1742, claimed the four Bohemian circles\r\neast of the Elbe and also that fringe of Silesia which the Treaty of\r\nBerlin had left in Austrian hands. Early in June all was arranged. By\r\nthe so-called Union of Frankfort some share in the undertaking was\r\npromised by the Elector Palatine and the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. But\r\nthe substantial allies were, as in the earlier war, France, Prussia,\r\nand Bavaria. The general plan agreed upon was that France should\r\ncripple the Sea Powers by attacking the Netherlands and Hanover. If the\r\nresult was to bring an Austrian army into Alsace, Frederick promised\r\nin his turn to cripple Austria by flinging eighty thousand men into\r\nBohemia. In that case the French undertook to make another campaign in\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nThe motives which inspired Frederick to take action are so clear that\r\nthere is no need to seek them in the solemn accusation against Austria\r\nwhich he gave to the world in August. He deemed it expedient to take up\r\nthe attitude of a German patriot, who, after exhausting the resources\r\nof negotiation, was driven to repel by force the conspiracy of the\r\nQueen of Hungary against the constitution of the Empire.\r\n\r\n    “The race of those Germans of old, who for so many centuries\r\n    defended their fatherland and their liberties against all the\r\n    majesty of the Roman Empire, still survives, and will make\r\n    the same defence to-day against those who dare to conspire\r\n    against them.... In one word, the King asks for nothing and\r\n    with him there is no question whatever of personal interests.\r\n    His Majesty has recourse to arms only to restore liberty to the\r\n    Empire, the sceptre to the Emperor and peace to Europe.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the Prussian account of the origin of the Second Silesian War.\r\n\r\nFrederick again resorted to the method of simultaneous parley and\r\nstroke which had served so well when he seized Silesia. On the same day\r\n(August 7, 1744) that his ambassador at Vienna announced his crusade\r\nto rescue the Emperor, he himself astonished the Saxons by showing\r\nthem the Emperor’s order to permit the passage of Prussian troops. It\r\nis characteristic of the tangled politics of the time that Prussia and\r\nSaxony remained technically at peace with each other while Frederick,\r\nas the Emperor’s servant, led sixty thousand men up the Elbe into\r\nBohemia and Augustus, as the ally of the Queen of Hungary, sent twenty\r\nthousand men to act against him. For the moment Frederick profited\r\nby his speed. At the beginning of September he lay before Prague and\r\njoined forces with twenty thousand men whom Schwerin had brought from\r\nSilesia. Eighty thousand Prussians were thus assembled in the heart of\r\nBohemia, and on September 16th they took the capital.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of success was, however, delusive. Far from being\r\npanic-stricken by Frederick’s sudden spring, the scrupulous Queen\r\nrejoiced to see him break the treaty which gave him a title to Silesia.\r\nFrom every point of the compass she summoned forces to defend Bohemia.\r\nThe army of Alsace recrossed the Rhine with great skill and marched\r\neastwards. They were undisturbed by the French, among whom Frederick’s\r\ntreacheries were passing into a proverb:—_se battre pour le roi de\r\nPrusse_, to fight without reward. Clouds of irregular horse issued from\r\nHungary. The Saxons were marching southwards. The people of Bohemia\r\nshowed themselves hostile to the Prussians and assisted an Austrian\r\narmy to maintain itself in the kingdom. What course, we may ask, was\r\nthe wisest for a commander surrounded by so many dangers?\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Prague Frederick lay in the centre of Bohemia,\r\na kingdom walled in by a quadrilateral of mountains. He held the\r\nnorth-eastern gates which led into Silesia. The south-western led into\r\nBavaria, and through them the army of Alsace was soon to enter. But at\r\nthe head of nearly 80,000 men the King was vastly stronger than any\r\nsingle force that could be brought against him and his communications\r\nwith Prussia were safe. There was therefore much to be said for a\r\nsimple defensive policy. North-eastern Bohemia was the prize that\r\nFrederick hoped to gain by the war, and this he could have held like\r\na second Silesia. Such a desertion of his allies would, however, have\r\nshocked public opinion, particularly in France, and Frederick admits\r\nthat he shrank from it on that account.\r\n\r\nThe next best course, if some offensive movement must be made, would\r\nhave been first to crush the army of Bohemia and then to hold the\r\nsouth-western gate against the army of Alsace. This course was advised\r\nby Schwerin and favoured by the King. But the fatal influence of\r\nBelleisle proved stronger than the promptings of common-sense. France\r\nwas avenged for the treacheries of Klein Schnellendorf and Berlin when\r\nFrederick allowed himself to be persuaded to strike due south, in the\r\nhope of conquering Bohemia, opening communications with Bavaria, and\r\ncowing Vienna.\r\n\r\nAt first the plan prospered. Several towns were captured for the\r\nEmperor, and by October 4, 1744, the Prussians had almost reached\r\nthe frontier of Austria proper. Then they began to realise that they\r\nwere the dupes of a mirage. The armies of Bohemia and of Alsace had\r\nunited in their rear and lay between them and Prague. They found\r\nthemselves isolated, ill fed, and worse informed. Swarms of light horse\r\nenveloped them, cutting off convoys, scouts, and messengers. Schwerin\r\nopened a line of retreat, but their recent conquests were lost with\r\nthe garrisons which held them. The Austrians had found a soldier,\r\nField-marshal Traun, and at his hands Frederick received painful\r\nlessons in the art of war. The King had already begun to negotiate.\r\nHe thirsted for French co-operation and a pitched battle, but could\r\nobtain neither boon. Traun, who was now superior in numbers, had no\r\nneed to fight. He occupied unassailable positions to the north of\r\nFrederick’s force and left hunger, disease, and irregulars to do their\r\nwork upon the enemy. Thus harassed, the Prussian rank and file deserted\r\nby thousands, and many offered their services to Traun. Schwerin again\r\ntook umbrage and withdrew from the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK THE SECOND, KING OF PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PAINTING BY F. BOCK.]\r\n\r\nStep by step the reluctant King was driven towards Silesia. Before\r\nthe end of November it was plain that his whole enterprise must be\r\nabandoned. It was mid-December before the last detachments of some\r\n40,000 men, the remnant of his 80,000, straggled across the mountains\r\nto the friendly walls of Glatz. Thanks to the determination of Maria\r\nTheresa, a postscript had yet to be added to the history of the\r\ncampaign. In the spirit of her own Hungarians, who scorned to provide\r\na commissariat because their forefathers had journeyed from Asia to\r\nthe Land of the Five Rivers without one, the Queen dictated a winter\r\nassault upon Silesia. The Old Dessauer, whom Frederick had left in\r\ncommand, at length succeeded in clearing the province of anything like\r\nan Austrian army, but it was not till February that the Prussians were\r\nable to go into winter quarters. Thus a campaign which had begun\r\nwith the conquest of Bohemia came to an end to the sound of _Te Deums_\r\nsung at Berlin for the deliverance of Silesia. Europe began to suspect\r\nthat the sword of Traun had pricked the Prussian bubble.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety with which Frederick awaited the spring of 1745, when he\r\nmust expect to have to fight in earnest for Silesia, was rendered more\r\nintense by a sudden change in the attitude of his allies. He had joined\r\nin the struggle with the expectation that Austria would be attacked by\r\nthe French and hampered both by the war in Italy and by the forces of\r\nthe Emperor. On January 20th, however, Charles Albert died, and the\r\nyouth who succeeded him was soon beaten to his knees. By the Treaty\r\nof Füssen, in April, Austria and Bavaria agreed to ignore the past;\r\nand the latter for the first time guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction\r\nand promised to vote for the husband of Maria Theresa at the imperial\r\nelection. The effect of this treaty upon Frederick’s position will\r\nbe appreciated when it is borne in mind that the road from France to\r\nAustria passed through Bavaria, while the Austrian Netherlands, which\r\nFrance coveted, lay at her very door. Thus it was easy to suspect that\r\nin the coming campaign Prussia would receive little effective help\r\nfrom France. Suspicion passed into certainty when Louis XV. elected to\r\naccompany his army in person.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1745 might therefore be expected to fall into two\r\nseparate halves. In the Netherlands, France would be pitted against the\r\nSea Powers and an Austrian contingent, while in Silesia Austria would\r\nmake a great effort against Prussia. At the same time the secondary\r\nstruggle of Austria with Spain and France would go on in Italy, while\r\nFrench and Austrian corps would guard the Rhine. It is evident at a\r\nglance that the withdrawal of the French and Bavarians must greatly\r\nimprove the prospects of Austria with regard to Silesia. And when (May,\r\n1745) she was joined by Saxony, whose help all parties desired, in an\r\nundertaking to make no peace until Frederick should resign Silesia and\r\nGlatz to the one and part of his hereditary dominions to the other,\r\nthe Queen might well be sanguine. Much of her advantage was, however,\r\nthrown away by an error common to Hapsburg rulers, who are wont to\r\nbelieve that no family is so fitted as their own for command. The\r\ninvasion of Silesia was entrusted to Prince Charles of Lorraine, the\r\nnominal leader of the army in the previous year, while Traun, the real\r\nauthor of the Austrian success, was sent to watch the Imperial election\r\nat Frankfort. The consequence was that the Austrians did not move till\r\nMay, and that they were worse generalled than the Prussians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Frederick had been assiduous in preparing for war and in\r\nnegotiating to avoid it. He was ready to put 80,000 foot and 30,000\r\nhorse into the field: but he had sued in vain for the alliance of\r\nSaxony and the aid of England and of Russia. The King, who in 1740\r\nhad offered millions to Maria Theresa and planned a partition of her\r\ndominions, must in 1745 implore Louis XV. for a subsidy to avert the\r\npartition of his own. But the danger to Prussia, though real, was not\r\nyet as overwhelming as her enemies believed. “Excellent bearskin to\r\nbe slit into straps,” chuckles Frederick’s admirer, “only the bear is\r\nstill on his feet.”\r\n\r\nThe King could still count upon two mighty allies,—upon his army,\r\nwhose spirit had been restored by the successes of the Old Dessauer in\r\nthe defence of Silesia, and upon himself. Both grew year by year more\r\nvaluable. At this crisis, as events were soon to prove, Frederick’s\r\nspirit was worthy of the Queen herself. “I have made it a point of\r\nhonour,” he wrote to Podewils on April 27, 1745, “to contribute more\r\nthan any other to the aggrandisement of my House. I have played a\r\nleading part among the crowned heads of Europe. These are so many\r\npersonal engagements which I have taken and which I am resolved to\r\nfulfil even at the cost of my fortune and my life.” Since the middle of\r\nMarch he had been making ready in Silesia, and in April he sent home\r\ndirections for carrying on the government if Berlin should be in danger.\r\n\r\nNext month he learned that his French allies, who were bent on\r\ncapturing Tournay, had gained a great victory at Fontenoy (11th May,\r\n1745). He received the news with mixed feelings. He had been striving\r\nto find words which might force into the mind of Louis XV. the truth\r\nthat victories in the Netherlands would do nothing for the common cause\r\nin Germany. “We beg the King of France,” he wrote, “not to imagine that\r\nany efforts of his in Flanders can procure the least relief for the\r\nKing of Prussia. If the Spaniards land in the Canary Islands, if the\r\nKing of France takes Tournay, or if Thamas Kuli-Chan besieges Babylon\r\nit is all one,” since such feats could not influence the war in Bohemia\r\nand Moravia. Yet it was not disheartening to know that Dettingen had\r\nbeen avenged and that other foes of Austria could more than hold their\r\nown. With renewed hope, Frederick bent all his energies to the task of\r\nholding Silesia.\r\n\r\nThe King had learned much from Traun, and he was no longer compelled to\r\nconsult the interests of his allies. He therefore avoided the mistakes\r\nof the former year. In 1745 his clear gaze penetrated the heart of the\r\nproblem which he had to solve, and he followed the right course with\r\nthe coolest daring. Silesia, he knew, was divided from the country of\r\nthe enemy by a mountain rampart more than three hundred miles in length\r\nand pierced by many roads. Veiled by clouds of light horse, Prince\r\nCharles might choose any of these roads without betraying his choice\r\nto the army of defence. What Neipperg had accomplished when he entered\r\nSilesia in 1741 might be repeated by Prince Charles on a greater scale,\r\nand with less favour from fortune the Prussians might this time be\r\ncrushed in detail. Frederick therefore drove sentiment from his breast,\r\nabandoned south-eastern Silesia to the Hungarians, and concentrated\r\nall his force in the neighbourhood of Neisse, a stronghold which the\r\nPrussians had made impregnable. His design was to admit the invaders\r\nto Silesia in the hope of catching them at a disadvantage and of\r\ndestroying their enterprise at a blow.\r\n\r\nThe result was that, when the allies came, they came in the highest\r\nspirits. Their progress had been as fortunate as they could have hoped.\r\nFirst, as usual, troops of wild riders poured into Silesia from the\r\nsouth-east. They enjoyed the success which Frederick’s plan assured to\r\nthem, and treason among his soldiers gave them Cosel, a fortress on the\r\nupper Oder. Then Prince Charles moved northward from Königgrätz into\r\nthe mountains and 30,000 Saxons joined him on the way. On June 3, 1745,\r\nthe combined army marched proudly down into the plain. Breslau lay\r\nlittle more than two days’ march to the north-east of them.\r\n\r\nThe fixed idea of Prince Charles was that Frederick would behave in\r\n1745 as he had behaved in 1744; that is to say, that he would retreat.\r\nThis delusion had been carefully fostered by the King. Discovering\r\nthat one of the spies whom he kept in the Austrian camp was in fact\r\nselling Prussian secrets to the enemy, Frederick cleverly hinted to\r\nhim that he was afraid of being cut off from Breslau. The spy informed\r\nPrince Charles, who readily gave credit to information which confirmed\r\nhis previous belief. Frederick then ordered some repairs on the roads\r\nleading to the capital and supplied further proof of his intention,\r\nif any were needed, by leaving the passes unguarded. Prince Charles\r\ntherefore emerged from the mountains in entire ignorance of the fact\r\nthat he was to be attacked by a force of 70,000 men. The invaders\r\nencamped upon a plain some five miles broad and as flat as the field of\r\nMollwitz, with the little town of Hohenfriedberg on the edge of the\r\nmountains to their rear, and Striegau, a place of greater size, on\r\nthe hills before them. The Saxon vanguard, which had already been in\r\ncontact with the enemy, was instructed to seize Striegau next morning,\r\nif the Prussians still ventured to hold it. “There can be no God in\r\nheaven,” said Prince Charles, “if we do not win this battle.”\r\n\r\nFrederick’s camp lay almost at right angles to the line of the allies\r\nbetween Hohenfriedberg and Striegau. That night (June 3–4, 1745) the\r\nPrussians stole silently from their stations, crossed a stream which\r\nseparated them from the enemy, and ranged themselves before him in\r\nline of battle. At dawn they began a general attack as furious as it\r\nwas unexpected. The Saxons, always unfortunate in war, were the first\r\nto suffer, and their dogged resistance only increased their loss. The\r\nAustrian infantry stood firm, but their cavalry could no longer face\r\nthe Prussians. Thus the Austrian centre and right wing, though favoured\r\nby the ground, could gain no advantage sufficient to compensate for the\r\ndisasters of the Saxons on the left. Hohenfriedberg was a soldiers’\r\nbattle, and the decisive stroke was an irresponsible charge of the\r\nBaireuth dragoons, who dashed at the enemy through a dangerous gap in\r\nthe Prussian line. The shock carried all before it. More than sixty\r\nstandards were captured by this regiment alone. By eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning the Austrians were in retreat towards the mountains and the\r\ninvasion of Silesia was at an end.\r\n\r\nThe allied army fled so quickly, writes the historian of the\r\nEvangelical church at Hohenfriedberg, that little damage was done in\r\nthe place, and the inhabitants were soon able to bear what succour they\r\ncould to the wounded, who lay in thousands on the plain below. In about\r\nfour hours’ fighting the victors had lost more than 4000 men killed\r\nor wounded, and the vanquished about 10,000. These figures do not,\r\nhowever, represent one tithe of the advantage which Frederick gained\r\nat Hohenfriedberg. He had reduced the allied army by some 25,000 men,\r\nof whom 7000 were prisoners and many more deserters. Every German army\r\nat that time included thousands of professional soldiers who fought\r\nfor either side indifferently and preferred the victors’ pay to their\r\npursuit. Thousands more fought against their will, and the retreat\r\nthrough mountains gave them an opportunity to slip away. For a month\r\nthe Prussians hung in the rear of the allies and drove them as far as\r\nKöniggrätz. Instead of his defensive attitude in Silesia, Frederick\r\nnow took up a defensive-offensive in Bohemia, a plan which was as\r\ncreditable to his strategy as the battle had been to his tactics. Above\r\nall other advantages he had gained this at Hohenfriedberg—that he could\r\nhenceforth trust his cavalry. Worthless at Mollwitz, respectable at\r\nChotusitz, at Hohenfriedberg they proved themselves superb. The panel\r\nwhich commemorates the victory in the Prussian Hall of Fame portrays\r\nthe dragoons swooping down upon the white-clad infantry of Austria.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of Frederick the Warrior on this bloody fourth of June\r\nrevealed interesting glimpses of Frederick the man. In his first\r\ntransports of delight he hugged the French ambassador and astonished\r\nhim by owning gratitude to God. “So decisive a defeat,” he informed his\r\nmother, “has not been since Blenheim.” He believed that the Queen would\r\nnow come to terms, and wrote to Podewils that it must have softened the\r\nheart of Pharaoh. His delight found vent in music, and he composed his\r\n_March of Hohenfriedberg_. But soon the statesman reappeared. None of\r\nthese ebullitions clouded his insight into the situation of affairs. He\r\nsaw clearly that his aims of the year before were still impracticable,\r\nthat what he needed was peace, and that his victory must have brought\r\npeace nearer by discouraging the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is true that now, as so often before, Frederick underrated the\r\nfirmness of the Queen. He was further disappointed by the unyielding\r\nattitude of Augustus, who possessed a dangerous patron in the Czarina.\r\nBut England, the paymaster of the coalition, had no stomach for a war\r\nof vengeance against Prussia. To her the Austrian alliance was merely\r\nan investment. It would be profitable only if it produced hard fighting\r\nagainst her real foes, the French. Fontenoy, where the Sea Powers had\r\nbeen left to do their own fighting, shook her faith in her Hapsburg\r\nally, and the conduct of the Eastern campaign showed that the Queen’s\r\nthoughts centred on the recovery of the province which England had\r\ninduced her to give up. At this juncture England herself was attacked.\r\nThe invasion of the Pretender compelled her to recall her troops from\r\nthe Continent and favoured the convention which was concluded at\r\nHanover towards the end of August. By the Convention of Hanover, signed\r\non the 26th August, 1745, Frederick a third time deserted the French.\r\nHe promised to vote for Francis at the Imperial election on condition\r\nthat Silesia should be guaranteed to him by all Europe, while George\r\nII. undertook to induce Austria to renew the Treaty of Berlin within\r\nsix weeks.\r\n\r\nThe good offices of England, which as usual consisted in pressing the\r\nQueen to buy off her enemies, were entirely useless. At the end of\r\nAugust Austria and Saxony drew closer together, and on September 13th\r\nthe House of Hapsburg regained its old prestige by the election of\r\nFrancis as Emperor. Soon afterwards Frederick perceived that he had\r\nexhausted the supplies of north-eastern Bohemia and began to retire\r\ntowards Silesia. By the end of September he had crossed the Elbe and\r\nencamped with 18,000 men at the foot of the mountains near the village\r\nof Soor. There something like his own manœuvre of Hohenfriedberg was\r\npractised upon him by Prince Charles with an army almost double the\r\nsize of Frederick’s. Under cover of darkness the Austrians took up\r\npositions commanding the Prussian camp. Only the King’s swift grasp of\r\nthe situation and the wonderful skill and speed of his troops averted\r\na great disaster. In a five hours’ fight the Austrians were driven\r\noff, leaving more than 4000 men on the field and more than 3000 in\r\nthe enemy’s hands. The number of Prussian casualties exceeded 3000—a\r\nheavy price to pay for bad scouting. Frederick was, moreover, put to\r\ngreat inconvenience by the sack of his camp and the capture of his\r\nsecretary, the silent, assiduous Eichel.\r\n\r\nAt Soor, Frederick gained a safe retreat to Silesia and a lesson to be\r\ncareful in the future. But victory made him inattentive to the lesson.\r\nThe behaviour of his men had been beyond all praise. They formed\r\nunder fire; the cavalry charged up-hill and routed the enemy, and the\r\ninfantry, though unsupported, attacked superior numbers and captured\r\nbatteries. The King, not unnaturally, began to believe that there was\r\nnothing which he and his soldiers could not accomplish. The result,\r\nin a future as yet far distant, was great glory mingled with great\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months the Prussian rank and file gathered fresh\r\nlaurels. Once more Frederick believed that he had tamed the Queen and\r\nonce more he found himself mistaken. As in every previous year of the\r\nSilesian wars, Maria Theresa ordered an attack upon her enemy in the\r\nwinter. This of 1745 was threefold and the goal was not Breslau but\r\nBerlin. Prince Charles’s army was to march from Bohemia into Saxony\r\nand to join with the Saxons in a march to Frankfurt-on-Oder, while\r\n10,000 men detached by Traun crossed Germany and seized Berlin. Enough\r\nof this elaborate plan was blabbed to the Swedish ambassador by the\r\nSaxon Premier, Count Brühl, to put Frederick upon his guard. His own\r\narmy had gone into winter quarters. A force under the Old Dessauer,\r\nwhich had been stationed for some time at Halle in readiness to spring\r\nat the throat of Saxony, was likewise laid up for the winter. Podewils\r\nand the Old Dessauer refused to credit a scheme at once so grandiose\r\nand so dangerous to the Saxons, who in case of failure would be left at\r\nthe mercy of Prussia. The King, however, overruled them, rushed into\r\nSilesia, collected 35,000 men, marched for some days parallel with\r\nthe unsuspecting Prince Charles, and on November 23, 1745, crushed\r\nhis Saxon vanguard at Hennersdorf. At this blow the whole enterprise\r\ncollapsed. The Austrians retired into Bohemia, followed by Augustus and\r\nCount Brühl, who stubbornly rejected the Prussian overtures for peace.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Old Dessauer, who had captured Leipzig, was making for\r\nDresden under urgent orders to attack the Saxon force wherever he might\r\nfind it. Four armies were at this time converging upon the capital. The\r\nSaxons under Count Rutowski, with whom were the Austrian contingent\r\nfrom the West, formed a force of 35,000 men and lay to the westward of\r\nthe Elbe and of the city. The Old Dessauer, having secured Meissen, had\r\nprovided a bridge across the river by which Frederick marching from the\r\nEast could join him in case of need. But Prince Charles with 46,000 men\r\nwas advancing towards Dresden from the side of Bohemia, and Frederick\r\nfeverishly urged his veteran lieutenant to strike a speedy blow. If the\r\nallies were to join forces the war might be prolonged and it seemed\r\nlikely that Russia would attack Prussia in the spring.\r\n\r\nPrince Charles was in fact only five miles distant when, on December\r\n15th, the Old Dessauer came upon Rutowski strongly posted at\r\nKesselsdorf. “Heavenly Father,” prayed the old man in the hearing\r\nof his devoted soldiers, “graciously aid me this day: but if Thou\r\nshouldest not be so disposed, at least lend not Thy aid to those\r\nscoundrels the enemy, but passively await the issue.” The task of the\r\ninfantry was even harder than that of capturing the batteries at Soor.\r\nTwice they were repulsed with a loss of nearly 1500 men out of 3600.\r\nBut the usual impetuosity of armies not perfectly trained came to\r\ntheir aid. The Saxons in the intoxication of victory charged from the\r\nentrenchments, only to be routed by the Prussian horse. This proved\r\nthe turning-point in a battle which cost Rutowski 3000 men killed and\r\nwounded and twice as many taken prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians lost some 4600 men, but they gained peace. Prince Charles\r\nfled once more into Bohemia and Dresden made no resistance. In the hour\r\nof triumph Frederick’s bearing was admirable. All through the winter\r\ncampaign he had showered insults upon the Old Dessauer, a prince born\r\nthe year after Fehrbellin and hero of well-nigh half a hundred battles\r\nand sieges. “My field-marshal is the only person who either cannot or\r\nwill not understand my plain commands.” “You go as slowly as though you\r\nwere determined to deprive me of my advantage.” Such were the royal\r\nwords which had goaded the old man into attempting the impossible\r\nat Kesselsdorf, where he exposed himself recklessly and received\r\nthree balls through his clothing. Now he enjoyed as ample amends as\r\nFrederick’s conception of the royal dignity permitted him to bestow.\r\nOn the day after the battle the King sprang from his horse at sight of\r\nhim, advanced to meet him with doffed hat, embraced him, and accepted\r\nhis guidance over the field.\r\n\r\nAt Dresden Frederick stayed eight days and showed himself anxious to\r\nplease. He entered the city, it is true, as a conqueror, in a carriage\r\ndrawn by eight horses, and he exacted a million thalers from the land.\r\nBut he visited and honoured the children of Augustus, played a leading\r\npart in the society of the place, attended church and opera on Sunday,\r\nand in general acted with the utmost moderation.\r\n\r\nIn the existing political situation, such conduct was no less politic\r\nthan humane. In spite of his triumph over the Saxons, Frederick’s\r\nposition was far from secure. Augustus was only a recent recruit in the\r\nphalanx of kings arrayed against Prussia. Russia, his patron, had yet\r\nto be reckoned with. The army of Prince Charles was unbroken. Southern\r\nSilesia was flooded with Hungarians. Traun might yet leave the Rhine\r\nand revive the painful memories of 1744. In face of all these dangers\r\nFrederick had no reserves. His treasury was empty and the anger of the\r\nFrench at the Convention of Hanover forbade him to expect assistance\r\nfrom them. These considerations made him willing to name a low price\r\nfor peace. Even when fleeing from Traun in 1744 he had demanded a part\r\nof Bohemia. Now after four victories he stipulated only that Austria\r\nshould renew the Treaty of Berlin. Maria Theresa was thus confronted\r\nwith the painful choice between abandoning, at least for the present,\r\nall hope of recovering Silesia and resigning the help of the Sea\r\nPowers, on which her hope of retaining Italy depended. The Saxon\r\nalliance had broken down, a negotiation with France was unsuccessful,\r\nand the Queen wisely consented to accept Frederick’s terms. At Dresden\r\non Christmas Day, 1745, treaties were signed which restored peace to a\r\ngreat part of Germany and closed the Second Silesian War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE TEN YEARS’ PEACE, 1746–1756\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Silesian wars, episodes in the eight years of general turmoil\r\nproduced by the Austrian Succession question, had now been brought by\r\nFrederick to a fortunate end. The Hapsburgs once more possessed the\r\nImperial crown, but the Hohenzollerns were masters of Silesia and their\r\ndays of vassalage were over.\r\n\r\nThe course of history has shown that by gaining Silesia Prussia enabled\r\nherself to become in time the principal German state. From this time\r\nonward, the Teutonic elements in the Hapsburg realm became more and\r\nmore outweighed by the rest, until in 1866 Austria, as a Power whose\r\npolitical centre was Buda-Pest, was finally expelled from Germany. In\r\n1745, it is true, the full significance of the transfer of Silesia was\r\nfelt rather than understood. But it was felt strongly enough to prevent\r\nFrederick from deluding himself with the vain belief that Austria would\r\nbe easily reconciled to her loss, or that she regarded the Peace of\r\nDresden as more sacred than the Peace of Berlin. The Queen, it was\r\nsaid, could not behold a Silesian without tears. Her spirit was so\r\nhigh that she is believed to have thought seriously of becoming her own\r\ncommander-in-chief, and her resources grew greater with every year of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s task of holding what he had so lightly seized in 1740\r\ntherefore grew no less difficult as time went on. He had good reason\r\nfor remaining constant to the principle which he professed at Dresden:\r\n“I would not henceforth attack a cat, except to defend myself.” His\r\npolicy, as he wrote in his Testament of 1752, was to maintain peace\r\nas long as might be possible without lowering the dignity of Prussia.\r\n“We have drawn upon ourselves the envy of Europe by the acquisition\r\nof Silesia,” he confessed. “It has put all our neighbours on the\r\nalert; there is none who does not distrust us.” The ink of the Treaty\r\nof Dresden was hardly dry ere new plans were mooted to blot it out.\r\nThe attitude of Russia towards the victor was menacing, that of\r\nPoland defiant, and it was easy to see that Austria and Saxony had an\r\nunderstanding with the Northern Powers which boded him no good.\r\n\r\nFrederick was, however, no longer a novice in diplomacy and he knew\r\nhis own mind. Evading all efforts to tempt him back into the whirlpool\r\nof war, he watched its successive phases till the Peace of 1748. He\r\nsaw the Queen turn her energies to Italy, while the Sea Powers, who\r\ncould not maintain themselves in the Netherlands without her aid, hired\r\ntroops in the only market open to them and brought 35,000 Russians\r\nto the Rhine. But the value of this new factor in the politics of\r\nWestern Europe had not been tested when the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nwas patched up. Then the exhausted combatants entered upon the task of\r\nreconstruction, in which Frederick had more than two years’ start of\r\nthem. To him the peace brought a guarantee by all Europe of the treaty\r\nby which he held Silesia.\r\n\r\nImperfect as it was, for it settled no great question, the Peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle gave pause to the armed strife of Europe for eight\r\nyears. Prussia therefore enjoyed a full decade of rest before 1756,\r\nwhen the third and greatest of her struggles for Silesia began. She\r\ndared not put off her harness, but she stood at ease. After the peace\r\nher army still numbered 135,000 men. But the crowned commander-in-chief\r\nhad now a leisure unattainable in time of war. His excuse for deserting\r\nhis ally at Dresden was that he wished to enjoy life and to labour for\r\nthe good of his subjects. Now his opportunity had come. It would be\r\nstrange if a reign of less than six years had destroyed the ideal which\r\nFrederick championed in his early treatise on kingcraft. Prussia and\r\nEurope might well expect that he would be, like the great-grandfather\r\nof whom he wrote the words, “as great in peace as in the bosom of\r\nvictory,” and that he would apply his untrammelled power to remedy\r\nwhatever defects his enlightened insight might still discover in the\r\nPrussian State. Frederick the Warrior had cleared the way for Frederick\r\nthe Reformer. Ought not Prussian history in the fifties to be a story\r\nof regeneration?\r\n\r\nThe King himself, however, practically omits the record of this\r\ndecade from his history of the reign. He assigns as the reason that\r\n“political intrigues which lead to nothing deserve no more notice than\r\nteasing in society, and the particulars of the internal administration\r\ndo not afford sufficient material for history.” His great English\r\nadmirer holds that this routine work in itself was eminent, that\r\n“one day these things will deserve to be studied to the bottom;\r\nand to be set forth, by writing hands that are competent, for the\r\ninstruction and example of Workers,” but that “of Frederick’s success\r\nin his Law-Reforms, in his Husbandries, Commerces and Furtherances,\r\nconspicuously great as it was, there is no possibility of making\r\ncareless readers cognisant at this day.” Carlyle then explains that\r\nthe visit of Voltaire to Frederick and their quarrel is one of the few\r\nthings perfectly knowable in this period and the only thing which the\r\npopulations care to hear.\r\n\r\nThe following chapter of this book is written in the belief that\r\nreaders of the story of Frederick may well demand, above all else,\r\nwhether he is justly termed “The Great,” and if so, in virtue of what\r\nachievements? Unless we are willing to answer that the title is his of\r\nright because he seized Silesia and held it against great odds, these\r\nquestions compel us to enquire into his home administration. We know\r\nwell that the ruler is strong only because he wields the collective\r\nstrength of his nation, and that his chief task is to render the\r\nnation stronger and to improve the machinery by which its strength is\r\ncollected and exerted. A great ruler is one who, when the difficulties\r\nwhich he had to contend with are taken into account, is perceived to\r\nhave accomplished much more in the performance of this task than could\r\nbe expected from an ordinary man. If we find that Frederick improved\r\nthe lot of his subjects in a remarkable degree, or that he invented\r\nbeneficial institutions, or devised a system by which the future of\r\ngovernment in Prussia was assured and progress made easy, then we shall\r\nhave to concede to him a right to the title of Great other than that\r\nwhich conquest may confer.\r\n\r\nIt is of high importance to ascertain at the outset of the enquiry how\r\nfar Frederick was free to act as he pleased and to what extent he was\r\nfettered by constitutional or social ties. His whole manner of life,\r\nindeed, was such as to suggest the most complete freedom. From the\r\nmoment of his father’s death he was master of his people and of his\r\npolicy as few European potentates have ever been. Autocracy as well as\r\ndiligence is stamped upon even the externals of his everyday existence.\r\nThough his stature was not quite five feet seven inches, his ablutions,\r\nwhen performed at all, slight and few, and his dress of the shabbiest,\r\nno one ever suggested that his presence lacked kingliness. He usually\r\nwore an old grey hat of soft felt, a faded blue uniform smeared with\r\nthe snuff in which he indulged immoderately, and boots which through\r\nneglect were of a reddish colour. But his bearing, stern and caressing\r\nby turns, his clarion voice, and his glance which, as a contemporary\r\nowned, nothing could resist, made him the cynosure of whatever company\r\nhe was in. The absence of the customary trappings of royalty rendered\r\nthe King of Prussia less formidable to the poor, whom he patronised,\r\nwhile it marked his contempt for the official and middle classes, whom\r\nhe sometimes allowed to kiss the skirts of his dirty coat.\r\n\r\nFrederick, it need hardly be said, was fully conscious of his own\r\nsuperiority to his subjects in birth, address, and talent. During\r\nhis incognito visit to Strasburg in 1740, Marshal Broglie remarked\r\nthe contrast between Frederick and Algarotti on the one hand and the\r\nawkward Germans of the party on the other. The vivacity of the King’s\r\ncircle was almost all imported from abroad. Many years later the\r\nFrench philosopher d’Alembert stated that Frederick himself was the\r\nonly man in Prussia with whom it was possible to hold conversation\r\nas the word was understood in France. The man who by right of birth\r\nwas absolute ruler of Prussia had some reason to believe that he was\r\nalso the greatest poet, historian, philosopher, critic, administrator,\r\nlegislator, statesman, captain, and general in his dominions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANS-SOUCI. CARYTID FRONT.]\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no more conclusive proof of his wisdom than that\r\nhis consciousness of this unique endowment did not cause his home\r\npolicy to become tyrannical and his foreign policy grandiose. From\r\nthe second fault he was saved by his keen eye for realities, which\r\ntaught him that, as he confessed, Prussia was playing a part among\r\nthe Great Powers without being in fact the equal of the rest. That he\r\nnever became a tyrant, was probably due in part to natural humanity\r\nand in part to the philosophy which was his pride. He was often harsh\r\ntowards his subjects, but he proclaimed that his duty was to make them\r\nhappy and he never shed their blood. His threats to execute his\r\nministers were mere insults. But philosophy did not check one evil to\r\nwhich he was inclined by nature and impelled by situation. Nothing\r\nshort of human sympathy could have mitigated his contempt for the\r\npopulace, which gathered strength with years. “My dear Sulzer,” he\r\nreplied to an educational theorist who urged that men were naturally\r\ninclined to good, “you do not know that curséd race as I do.” “It is\r\nmore probable,” he held, “that we sprang from evil spirits, if such\r\nthings could exist, than from a Being whose nature is good.” As he rode\r\nthrough the streets of his capital on one famous occasion, he came\r\nupon a group of the discontented staring at a seditious cartoon. “Hang\r\nit lower down,” was his scornful order, “so that they need not strain\r\ntheir necks to see it.”\r\n\r\nTo the service of those whom he termed the rabble, none the less,\r\nFrederick devoted a great share of a life of incessant labour. Every\r\nday, Sunday and week-day alike, was parcelled out so as to contain\r\nthe greatest possible amount of work. “It is not necessary that I\r\nshould live,” wrote the King, “but it is necessary that I should act.”\r\nHe toiled for the State and for himself, and, with the exception of\r\nregular visits to his mother and Madame de Camas, he admitted few\r\nsocial claims upon his time. His Queen never even saw his favourite\r\nhome, Sans Souci, which he built in the park at Potsdam in 1747. She\r\nknew so little of his affairs that she gave a party at Schönhausen\r\nwhile he was lying _in extremis_. The consideration which he denied\r\nto her he did not give to others whose title to it was less strong.\r\nAs he grew older, he curtailed even the short time that he had been\r\nwont to spend in his capital, and divided the bulk of the year between\r\nseclusion at Potsdam and the inspection of his provinces.\r\n\r\nHis habit was to rise at dawn or earlier. The first three or four hours\r\nof the morning were allotted to toilet, correspondence, a desultory\r\nbreakfast of strong coffee and fruit, preceded by a deep draught of\r\ncold water flavoured with fennel leaves, and flute-playing as an\r\naccompaniment to meditation on business. Then came one or two hours\r\nof rapid work with his secretaries, followed by parade, audiences,\r\nand perhaps a little exercise. Punctually at noon Frederick sat down\r\nto dinner, which was always the chief social event of the day and in\r\nlater life became his only solid meal. He supervised his kitchen like a\r\ndepartment of State. He considered and often amended the bill of fare,\r\nwhich contained the names of the cooks responsible for every dish.\r\nAfter dinner he marked with a cross the courses which had merited his\r\napproval. He inspected his household accounts with minute care and\r\nproved himself a master of domestic economy. The result was a dinner\r\nthat Voltaire considered fairly good for a country in which there was\r\nno game, no decent meat, and no spring chickens.\r\n\r\nTwo hours, sometimes even four, were spent at table. Occasionally the\r\ntime was devoted to the discussion of important business with high\r\nofficials, but in general Frederick used it to refresh himself after\r\nhis six or seven hours of toil. He ate freely, preferring highly spiced\r\ndishes, drank claret mixed with water, and talked incessantly. He was\r\na skilful and agreeable host, putting his guests instantly at their\r\nease, and, by Voltaire’s account, calling forth wit in others. After\r\ndismissing the company he returned to his flute, and then put the\r\nfinal touches to the morning’s business. After this he drank coffee\r\nand passed some two hours in seclusion. During this period he nerved\r\nhimself for fresh grappling with affairs by plunging into literature.\r\nIn the year 1749 he produced no less than forty works. About six\r\no’clock he was ready to receive his lector or to converse with artists\r\nand learned men. At seven began a small concert, in which Frederick\r\nhimself used often to perform. Supper followed, but was brief, unless\r\nthe conversation was of unusual interest. Otherwise the King went\r\nto bed at about nine o’clock and slept five or six hours. In later\r\nlife he gave up suppers, but continued to invite a few friends for\r\nconversation. He then allowed himself rather more sleep. In his last\r\nyears he lost the power to play his flute and with it, apparently, the\r\ndesire to hear music.\r\n\r\nThe sketch which has been given of Frederick’s daily life suggests that\r\nwhatever his power might be, it was not subjected to the interference\r\nof others. At Potsdam there was no place for the ordinary influences\r\nwhich were brought to bear upon Kings. Frederick would not endure the\r\npresence of any woman, and, strictly speaking, he had no courtiers.\r\nHis intimates were not politicians, but wits and men of letters, for\r\nthe most part of foreign birth. Even those who accused him of hideous\r\nvices admitted that he never suffered his accomplices to have the\r\nsmallest influence over him. Eichel and the two other secretaries who\r\nworked with the King every day were slaves rather than counsellors.\r\nThey lived in such seclusion that, according to the French ambassador,\r\nEichel was never seen by any human being. During Frederick’s last\r\nillness, he forced their successors to attend him at four o’clock\r\nin the morning, so that the few weeks that might yet remain to him\r\nshould be serviceable to the State. One of them fell to the ground\r\nin a fit, but the King merely summoned another, and went on with the\r\nbusiness. Through their hands passed Frederick’s correspondence with\r\nhis ministers, whom he rarely saw. “In his orders of two lines,”\r\ngrumbled a subordinate, “he announced no reasons.” He was of course\r\nobliged to listen to the ambassadors of foreign Powers. As though to\r\navenge himself for this, he tolerated no suggestions from his own. He\r\ndesired spies rather than advisers, and often chose men of inferior\r\nintelligence to fill high diplomatic posts. On every hand we find\r\ntokens that Frederick looked to his own breast alone for inspiration in\r\nthe exercise of his power.\r\n\r\nTo realise how unfettered was the authority that Frederick wielded we\r\nmust consider the peculiar structure of the society over which he ruled\r\nand of the machinery by which he ruled it. Frederick’s Prussia was a\r\nstate which just a century of strong monarchical rule had manufactured\r\nout of a number of Hohenzollern fiefs. Its basis still remained feudal.\r\nThere were few social classes, and strong barriers separated class\r\nfrom class. The career open to a Prussian was strictly limited by his\r\nbirth. Between town and country the law reared a dividing wall, unseen\r\nbut impassable. Townsmen alone were allowed to become manufacturers,\r\nmerchants, and civil servants. They paid a special tax, the “Excise,”\r\nlevied on the articles which they consumed. They had magistrates of\r\ntheir own choosing, a relic of the municipal independence which the\r\nGreat Elector had broken down.\r\n\r\nTo the countryfolk, on the other hand, the King looked for his army.\r\nThey were divided into two great classes; the nobles, who alone might\r\nbecome officers, and the peasants, who were still serfs tied to the\r\nestates of their lords. The nobles enjoyed exemption from ordinary\r\ntaxes and paid only a small feudal rent to the Crown. Upon the\r\nshoulders of the peasants fell the heavy burden of the “Contribution,”\r\na direct payment in money. Neither they nor the nobles might become\r\ncraftsmen or engage in commerce. The barrier which separated the two\r\nclasses of countryfolk was as firm as that which separated both from\r\nthe dwellers in towns. New patents of nobility were rarely granted by\r\nthe King, but all the children of a noble were nobles. Even the soil\r\nwas divided into noble-lands and peasant-lands, and neither class might\r\nacquire the portion of the other.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that this system of rigid class division was unlikely\r\nto ensure to every Prussian the career for which he was best fitted. In\r\nFrederick’s eyes, however, it possessed two supreme merits, and for the\r\nsake of these he was willing to make it eternal. It provided a gigantic\r\narmy and it contained no germ of opposition to the Crown.\r\n\r\nPrussia under Frederick was practically one vast camp. Every\r\nsocial class had a military function to perform. The King was\r\ncommander-in-chief and paymaster-general. The nobles formed the corps\r\nof officers. Some of the peasants were called on to bear arms while the\r\nrest laboured in the fields to produce the necessary supplies of food.\r\nThe burghers, who have been styled the commissariat department of the\r\narmy, armed and clothed the troops, and helped to provide funds with\r\nwhich to hire the foreigners of whom half the army was composed.\r\n\r\nIt was possible to entrust to foreigners so great a share in Prussian\r\nwars because the framework of the army was of iron. The native half of\r\neach regiment was drawn from a particular locality. It consisted of\r\npeasants led by the lords whom they had been accustomed from infancy\r\nto obey. The regiment was ruled in a fashion almost patriarchal by a\r\ncommander who gave it his own name. Under this system _esprit de corps_\r\nbecame a passion, and none knew better than Frederick how to turn it to\r\ngood account. To the army “Prussia” was a name which within the memory\r\nof their fathers had been arbitrarily assigned to the dominions of the\r\nelder branch of the House of Hohenzollern. Where national patriotism\r\nwas in its infancy, local patriotism was all the more intense, and it\r\nwas by playing upon this that Frederick, the Father of all his lands,\r\ncalled forth many marvellous feats of arms.\r\n\r\nBut the King, though he fostered profitable sentiment, was far too\r\nwary to trust to it over much. He had other expedients for attracting\r\nnobles to the colours and for keeping the ranks full. He withdrew his\r\nroyal favour from those of noble birth who were so unpatriotic as\r\neither to avoid his service or to leave it in a few years. The social\r\narrangements which have been outlined above were yet more powerful in\r\nsecuring a supply of officers. The nobles were numerous, poor, and\r\nbrave. They must find some career, and what other lay open to them?\r\nWhen Frederick’s father began to impress cadets, many parents even\r\ntried to prove that they were not of noble birth. But with them, as\r\nwith many other classes of the discontented, firm government in the\r\nlong run brought cheerful obedience. “The King’s bread is the best,”\r\nbecame their maxim. Frederick marked his appreciation of their worth by\r\nrarely giving commissions to men of lower rank. It was not the least\r\nof his gains that he thus acquired military authority over the most\r\ninfluential class in his dominions.\r\n\r\nHe made sure of the common man by stern discipline. Although the\r\nPrussian members of each regiment were bound together by social and\r\nlocal bonds, by no means all of them were willing to fight for the\r\nKing. They were conscripts, not volunteers, and they were released only\r\nwhen they became unfit to serve. Not a few deserted to the enemy under\r\nstress of war. The foreigners who were their comrades under arms were\r\na varied host. Some were mercenaries, some deserters from the enemy,\r\nsome keen fighting men who were glad to serve in the finest army in the\r\nworld. Many had been kidnapped or pressed or tempted into the Prussian\r\nservice by false promises or admitted when their own countries were too\r\nhot to hold them. Frederick’s directions to Prussian commanders for\r\nthe march are based on the assumption that many of the men will desire\r\nto run away. When in time of war some of the peasants volunteered, the\r\nastonished King asked what finer deed the Romans of old had performed.\r\n\r\nHis standing remedy against disintegration was “to make the discipline\r\nso stern and the punishments so severe that the men would learn to fear\r\ntheir own superiors more than the enemy.”\r\n\r\n    “The punishments were barbarous,” writes Professor Martin\r\n    Philippson. “Thrashing was customary. Imprisonment, sharpened\r\n    by all kinds of chastisement and torment, was not rare. The\r\n    most terrible of all was running the gauntlet, in which the\r\n    offender was stripped to the waist and forced to run from\r\n    twenty to thirty times through a living lane of hundreds of\r\n    soldiers armed with rods, while the officers looked to it that\r\n    every man laid on lustily. Hundreds of wretched men gave up the\r\n    ghost under these tortures.”\r\n\r\nYet of the rank and file it may be said with more confidence than of\r\nany other section of Frederick’s subjects that they loved the King.\r\n\r\nEnough, perhaps, has been said to suggest that where classes were so\r\nsharply divided there was little likelihood of any national resistance\r\nto the Crown and that the Prussian military system gave Frederick a\r\npeculiar authority over two great sections of his people. A further\r\nsource of power consisted in his enormous wealth. In every province\r\nthe Crown possessed vast domains amounting in all to nearly one-third\r\nof the soil of Prussia. The result was that Frederick was lord of\r\ninnumerable peasants and by far the greatest capitalist in his\r\ndominions. To him the nobles looked for help in time of dearth, while\r\nthe townsmen expected him to bear the initial loss of new industrial\r\nenterprises. His domestic policy was directed towards the maintenance\r\nof this position. For him the notion of taxes fructifying in the\r\npockets of the people had no charm. His ideal was that of subjects\r\npaying the greatest possible amount of taxes to be administered by the\r\nhead of the State. Under his father’s rule the limit of profitable\r\ntaxation had already been reached, but Frederick was able to make\r\nthe collectors stricter than before. Though no spot in the Mark or\r\nPomerania or Magdeburg was more than twenty miles from a border, the\r\nfrontiers of his straggling dominions were watched with a vigilance\r\nwhich became proverbial. An Italian priest, whom he begged to smuggle\r\nhim through the gate of heaven under his cassock, professed that he\r\nwould be charmed to do so, provided that the search for contraband were\r\nnot so keen as in Prussia. Liberty of commerce and remission of taxes\r\nwere not among the ideals of a King who claimed to direct all the\r\neconomic activities of his people.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian clergy had less power than the moneyed interest, and less\r\ndesire than the landed interest, to oppose or influence the will of the\r\nKing. His absolutism was favoured by the fact that in his dominions\r\nseveral jealous churches existed side by side, and that he alone could\r\nbe the umpire in their disputes. His own point of view was perfectly\r\nclear. He valued pastors because they taught their people to obey their\r\nsuperiors and not to rob and murder, as, in the King’s opinion, they\r\nwould do if unrestrained. If the pastors accomplished this duty with\r\nreasonable success they might, without fear of his displeasure use any\r\nritual or proclaim any doctrine of which their congregations approved.\r\n\r\nFrederick regarded the Protestant teaching as far more useful than\r\nthe Romanist, but was determined to protect each in the enjoyment\r\nof its rights and privileges. He professed himself willing to build\r\nmosques for Turks and heathen if they would people the land. He was\r\nthe official head of the Lutheran Church, whose clergy then, as\r\nalways, preached the divine right of Kings. The King for his part\r\nusually jeered at their faith only in private. At times, however, he\r\nallowed his contempt for their observances to appear. When several\r\ncongregations appealed to him to condemn a new hymn-book he despatched\r\na refusal, and added with his own hand, “Everyone is free to sing ‘Now\r\nall the woods are resting’ and more of such stupid nonsense.” In the\r\nsame spirit he answered the clergy of Potsdam who begged him not to\r\nblock out the light from their church, “Blessed are they which have not\r\nseen and yet have believed.”\r\n\r\nFrederick’s relations with his many papist subjects ran all the\r\nsmoother because the contemporary Popes were as a rule too much\r\nengrossed by troubles within their own flock to engage in unnecessary\r\naggressions. His treatment of the papists in his hereditary dominions\r\nwas always carried out in the spirit of his answer to the monks of\r\nCleves. Though hardly meritorious in the eyes of the Holy Father, it\r\nwas too upright to give reasonable cause of offence. Near the royal\r\npalace in Berlin rose the Hedwigs-Kirche, a temple modelled on the\r\nPantheon at Rome and built by the heretic King for the use of Romanists.\r\n\r\nIn the conquered provinces, however, a more difficult problem\r\nconfronted him. The Romanists, who formed the bulk of the population\r\nof Upper Silesia and were powerful even in Breslau, could not be\r\nexpected to accept with pleasure the head of an alien church as their\r\nsupreme lord. The Prussian confiscation of one-half the net revenues\r\nof the conventual houses and at a later date the disgrace of Cardinal\r\nSchaffgotsch were measures dictated by needs of State, but not on\r\nthat account less unwelcome to the Church. The papists of Silesia,\r\nparticularly the clergy and the Jesuits, long continued to hope for the\r\nrestoration of Hapsburg rule.\r\n\r\nEven in Silesia, however, Frederick’s policy of impartial firmness\r\ndisarmed his religious opponents in the end. While his neighbours\r\nwere expelling the Jesuits from their dominions and confiscating the\r\nestates of the Church, his doors stood open to the fugitives and the\r\noriginal settlement of the relations between Church and State remained\r\nunvaried. It must not be forgotten, too, that the King of Prussia was\r\nthe patron and paymaster of a vast number of ecclesiastics of all\r\ncreeds. This fact finds illustration in one of the practical jokes\r\nwhich he played upon his needy friend Pöllnitz. Although he had already\r\nchanged his religion in hope of a lucrative marriage, Frederick tempted\r\nhim by hinting that a rich canonry in Silesia was vacant. Next day, as\r\nhe expected, Pöllnitz came to tell him that he had again recanted and\r\nwas now eligible for the post. The King replied that the appointment\r\nwas already made, but that he had still a place of Rabbi to dispose\r\nof—“Turn Jew and you shall have it.” With the same cynicism he exhorted\r\nand often compelled the clergy to practise apostolic poverty. “We\r\nfree them from the cares of this world,” he wrote to Voltaire after\r\na sweeping measure of confiscation, “so that they may labour without\r\ndistraction to win the Heavenly Jerusalem which is their true home.”\r\nIt is not surprising if Carlyle is justified in stating that under\r\nFrederick “the reverend men feel themselves to be a body of Spiritual\r\nSergeants, Corporals and Captains, to whom obedience is the rule and\r\ndiscontent a thing not to be indulged in by any means.”\r\n\r\nIf, then, it is vain to look either to any class of society or to the\r\nmilitary or ecclesiastical organisations for a possible check upon\r\nFrederick’s absolutism, the remainder of our quest must be confined\r\nwithin two fields—the Judiciary and the Executive. It is idle to\r\nimagine parliaments in Frederick’s Prussia. His ancestors had freed\r\nthemselves from the privileged assemblies which grew up in the several\r\nprovinces under the feudal system. To this day his successors upon the\r\nPrussian throne reject the claims of their subjects to what William II.\r\nstigmatised as “the freedom to govern themselves badly according to\r\ntheir own desires.” Nor was the absence of parliament atoned for by the\r\ninfluence of public opinion. Society at Berlin occasionally ventured to\r\nmark its disapproval of the King’s action. It was, however, a narrow\r\ncaste, which lacked even the wit to temper despotism by epigram. The\r\nKing, though he endowed his capital with many handsome buildings, took\r\nlittle pains to conciliate its inhabitants by living in their midst,\r\nand on occasion did not scruple to play upon their stupidity. “In 1767,\r\nthe King found the public at Berlin inclined to tattle on the chance\r\nof another war. To turn their attention he immediately composed and\r\nsent to the newspapers a full account of a wonderful hail-storm stated,\r\nthough without the smallest foundation in fact, to have taken place\r\nin Potsdam on the 27th of February in that year. Not only did this\r\nimaginary narrative engross for some time, as he desired, the public\r\nconversation, but it gave rise to some grave philosophical treatises on\r\nthe supposed phenomenon.” (Mahon.)\r\n\r\nMany despotisms have, however, been tempered by the judicial system\r\nof the nation or by the established machinery of administration. We,\r\ntherefore, turn finally to the judges and civil officers of Prussia\r\nfor some check upon Frederick’s power. But we find that in the\r\ndepartment of law he was as absolute as in any other. His subjects were\r\nno longer entitled to carry their suits to the Imperial courts, and\r\nthe King at once supplied the deficiency, and kept his judges under\r\nby making himself in person an accessible and swift tribunal of final\r\nappeal (1744).\r\n\r\nIn this connexion the case of Miller Arnold is of world-wide celebrity.\r\nA miller living near the Polish border was condemned by his lord to\r\nbe evicted for persistent non-payment of rent. He appealed to the\r\nchief court of the province for restitution, alleging that another\r\nnoble, who afterwards bought the mill, had deprived him of water by\r\nrestoring a fish-pond higher up the stream. When the court decided\r\nagainst him, he availed himself of the privilege of petition which\r\nFrederick accorded to all his subjects. The King deputed one of his\r\ncolonels to investigate the matter in company with a member of the\r\nprovincial court. The colonel reported in favour of Arnold, but his\r\ncolleague upheld the previous decision. The King, convinced that his\r\ncolonel was in the right and that a poor man was being robbed of his\r\nlivelihood by a legal quibble, ordered the provincial court to make a\r\nfresh enquiry. This second investigation only served to confirm their\r\nprevious view of the case, though an expert in drainage was of opinion\r\nthat the fish-pond really restricted the flow of water to the mill.\r\nThey declined to alter their verdict and Frederick ordered the judges\r\nat Berlin to revise it.\r\n\r\nThe judges obeyed and revised the depositions with great care. Once\r\nmore sentence was pronounced against Arnold. Thereupon the King\r\ndetermined to make an example of those who in his name oppressed the\r\npoor under form of law. He summoned before him the Chancellor and\r\nthe three judges at whose door he supposed the guilt to lie. To the\r\nChancellor he addressed six words only: “March, thy place is filled\r\nalready.” The three judges were first rated like malefactors and then\r\nflung into the common gaol.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to recite all the items of the King’s vengeance.\r\nHis hand fell as heavily upon the provincial court as upon the judges\r\nat Berlin. When the Minister of Justice refused to pronounce sentence\r\nagainst them, Frederick himself condemned them to loss of office, a\r\nyear’s imprisonment, and the payment of all that Arnold had lost. Thus\r\nthe miller triumphed, though he had in truth suffered no loss of water\r\npower. Not till the succeeding reign was his knavery exposed and the\r\nroyal decree reversed.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings, which took place in the later years of the reign,\r\nserve to show that Frederick was strong enough to trample the law\r\nand its ministers underfoot. In general, however, he proved himself\r\npractical, impartial, and firm in all that pertained to the judicial\r\nsystem. The story that a miller of Potsdam refused to sell his\r\nwind-mill to the King and answered his threats with a reference to\r\nthe courts, has been destroyed by modern criticism. “The laws must\r\nspeak and the sovereign be silent,” was, however, one of his maxims.\r\nThe distrust of lawyers which caused him to prefer the verdict of one\r\ncolonel to that of many judges did much to inspire the sweeping changes\r\nfor which the years following the Peace of Dresden are illustrious.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s law-reforms were in great part achieved by the aged\r\njurist Cocceji, who, with the King’s support, triumphed over all\r\nthe interested opposition of lawyers and of his rivals. In the\r\ncourse of the years 1747 and 1748, he abolished superfluous courts,\r\nraised the fees for litigation, quickened the procedure, established\r\nsatisfactory tests for judges and advocates, reduced the numbers of\r\nthese functionaries, and did away at one stroke with the whole class\r\nof solicitors. The violence of these reforms is a fresh proof of the\r\nKing’s omnipotence. He might by a stroke of the pen have given binding\r\nforce to the _Codex Fridericianus_, a famous code of law which Cocceji\r\ndrew up on principles of his own choosing.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that in Prussia the judges were forced to be “lions under\r\nthe throne.” The civil service gave less proof of courage and was\r\nequally impotent to oppose the will of the King. Its structure might\r\nhave been designed for the very purpose of preventing any official save\r\nthe King from enjoying any substantial power or prominence. The lower\r\nagents, who could not be dangerous, had no colleagues, but all the\r\nhigher functions were performed by boards. The villages were governed\r\nby the bailiffs of their lords, and thus a vast number of petty local\r\nofficers were directly responsible to the representative of the Crown.\r\nAbove the bailiffs stood the Sheriff (_Landrat_), who was nominated by\r\nthe local nobles, but appointed by the King and acted as his factotum.\r\nOne young _Landrat_ strove to convince Frederick that there were\r\nlocusts in his country by sending him some live specimens in a box.\r\nThey escaped in the palace, and the angry King straightway altered the\r\nconditions of the office, decreeing that in future no one should be\r\neligible who was under thirty-five years of age.\r\n\r\nIn the towns royal commissioners were charged with the collection of\r\nthe “Excise” and with duties of general supervision. But at the next\r\nstage collegiate administration begins. _Landrat_ and commissioner\r\nalike were responsible to the Provincial Chamber for War and Domains—a\r\nbody such as that on which Frederick had served while a prisoner at\r\nCüstrin. The individual members of the Chamber served the Crown as\r\ninspectors in their province and as special commissioners to carry out\r\nthe public works which the King constantly initiated. The Chamber as\r\na whole reviewed the work of the lower officials and reported to the\r\nGeneral Directory, a clumsy corporation of ministers, which in its turn\r\nreported to the King. It is hardly necessary to observe that Frederick\r\nconceded to no person or body in this hierarchy the right to stand\r\nbetween himself and any business with which he chose to interfere. He,\r\nlike his father, often preferred the evidence of his own eyes and of\r\nhis soldiers to the statements of his civil servants.\r\n\r\nThe General Directory had been created by Frederick William in 1723.\r\n\r\n    “We wish,” he frankly stated, “that any odium, however\r\n    undeserved, should fall not on us ... but on the\r\n    _General-Ober-Finanz-Kriegs-und-Domänen-Directorium_ [General\r\n    Supreme Financial War and Domains Directory] or on one or other\r\n    of the members of the same, unless it shall prove possible to\r\n    make the public change its bad opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe members were instructed to give such a turn to the business that\r\nthis aim might be realised, “because,” as the King expressed it, “we\r\nwish to be frugal as regards the love and affection of our subjects and\r\nof the friendship of our neighbours.”\r\n\r\nThe new body, as its name implies, was primarily concerned with\r\nfinance, which lay at the root of all Prussian government. It was\r\ncalled into being at the moment when Frederick William amalgamated\r\ntwo machines for collecting and expending revenue. It presided over\r\nthe administration of the old feudal revenue which came from the\r\nDomains and over that of the new national revenue which came from the\r\nContribution and Excise,—taxes imposed for the support of the apparatus\r\nof war. Foreign affairs and justice, each of which formed the charge\r\nof two or three other ministers, lay outside the sphere of the General\r\nDirectory.\r\n\r\nThis consisted of four departments, each of which supervised the\r\ngeneral administration on one great section of the soil of Prussia.\r\nThe North-east, the Centre, the West, and the districts lying between\r\nthe Centre and the West formed four distinct spheres of government,\r\neach of which was the special charge of a chief minister and several\r\nassistants. To these sectional departments, however, were assigned\r\nvarious minor charges extending over the whole kingdom. Thus the\r\nsecond department, which governed the Electoral Mark and Magdeburg,\r\nat one time also fulfilled the functions of commissary-general for\r\nall Prussia. It had in addition oversight over questions of salt,\r\nmillstones, cards, and stamps, in whatever locality they might arise.\r\nIf the chief of the department had four or five assistants a certain\r\nspecialisation was possible, but he was obliged to reckon with the\r\ncontingency that one or more of them might be commissioned to spend\r\npart of their time in another department.\r\n\r\nThe General Directory, as Frederick found it, contained four\r\ndepartments, but five chief ministers. The fifth, whose functions were\r\nthe general supervision of justice and of finance, was in Frederick\r\nWilliam’s conception a royal spy upon his colleagues. If they were\r\nidle, deceitful, or inharmonious, it was his duty to report the facts\r\nto the King, “that His Majesty may get no short measure anywhere and\r\nmay not be tricked.”\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that this machine of government, however cumbrous,\r\nwas admirably designed to serve a despotic king. An army of clerks and\r\ninspectors was always at his disposal. If he desired to know what was\r\npassing in the furthest corner of his dominions, a curt note of enquiry\r\nto the General Directory sufficed to set the machine in motion. The\r\nDirectory met five times a week, with no vacations. At its bidding,\r\ncommissioners were appointed by the Provincial Chamber to ascertain the\r\nfacts. In due course the Chamber received, digested, and annotated\r\ntheir report, and supplied the necessary information to the Directory.\r\nThere, in the department which presided over the province in question,\r\nthe papers were again sifted and abstracted.\r\n\r\nThe Directory could not often be hoodwinked by its subordinates, for\r\nFrederick William had furnished it with an army of local spies. Check\r\nafter check was applied. When the member of the department before whom\r\nthe affair was brought had satisfied himself, he procured the assent\r\nof his colleagues. The department procured the assent of the Directory\r\nas a whole. The Directory then reported to the confidential servants\r\nof the King. Eventually the most concise and accurate information\r\nobtainable, together with a table of arguments for and against a given\r\ncourse of action, was laid before the King by Eichel and his colleagues\r\nin the Cabinet. Frederick had only to glance at the paper and scrawl\r\na few words upon it in the morning and in the afternoon to sign a\r\nroyal order embodying his decision. Then General Directory, Provincial\r\nChamber, Sheriff, and Bailiff set to work in turn to procure the\r\nexecution of his commands.\r\n\r\nIt was objected that little Prussia had thirteen or fourteen ministers\r\nwhen France required no more than five. But the multiplication of high\r\nofficials had this advantage—that it prevented them from leaving the\r\nreal conduct of affairs in the hands of obscure subordinates. Not only\r\nmust every State paper be signed by one or more ministers, but every\r\nsignature implied actual knowledge of its contents. The system, too,\r\nprevented the rise of any single man or board that could challenge\r\ncomparison with the King by reason of its ascendancy in any great\r\nfunction of government. Even Cocceji appeared to the people merely as a\r\nroyal commissioner appointed to accomplish a definite mission.\r\n\r\nCorruption on any great scale was impossible. The public accounts\r\npassed under so many eyes that the King of Prussia could never, like\r\nCharles VI., be deprived of three-fourths of his revenue before it\r\nreached the exchequer. It was useless to bribe Frederick’s ministers\r\nto betray him, for they had not the power. They were there to give him\r\ninformation and to obey his behests. He seldom asked them for advice.\r\n“Good counsel does not come from a great number,” was his maxim.\r\nNewton, he maintained, could not have discovered the law of gravitation\r\nif he had been collaborating with Leibnitz and Descartes. As Minerva\r\nsprang armed from the head of Jupiter, so must a policy spring from the\r\nhead of the prince.\r\n\r\nFrederick, therefore, admitted no man or body of men as his colleague,\r\nin the work of government. The officers of the Directory, Justice,\r\nand Foreign Affairs were not allowed to form a conclave which might\r\nmeddle with questions of general welfare. As a body they were wont to\r\nappear before the King only once a year. As individuals they seldom\r\ncommunicated with him save in writing. The ministers of Foreign Affairs\r\nhad not even the privilege of writing about all of the important\r\nmatters which fell within the scope of their department. Their master\r\nkept the conduct of weighty negotiations within his own Cabinet and\r\ncorresponded with his ambassadors direct. Eichel was his sole familiar.\r\nSecrecy, which the King termed the soul of public business, was thus\r\npreserved inviolable. “To pry into my secrets,” he boasted, “they must\r\nfirst corrupt me.”\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to marshal the disadvantages to the State which\r\nthe Prussian system of administration involved. At this stage it\r\nis sufficient to note that it placed absolute power in Frederick’s\r\nhands and that he regarded it as a monument of the highest wisdom.\r\n“If you depart from the principles and the system that our father has\r\nintroduced,” ran his warning to his brother and heir, “you will be the\r\nfirst to suffer by it.”\r\n\r\nThe ten years of peace were therefore not devoted to structural\r\nreform. In the first year of his reign Frederick had created a fifth\r\ndepartment of the General Directory. To it he entrusted first the trade\r\nand manufactures of the whole kingdom and later the posts and the\r\nsettlement of immigrants from other lands. In 1746 he established in\r\nlike manner a sixth department, that of Military Affairs. These changes\r\nmerely developed the system of Frederick William a little further.\r\nBy a new departure, however, the Government of Silesia was made\r\nindependent of the General Directory. For reasons which the King never\r\nstated, Münchow became the only minister for the province, and he was\r\nresponsible to Frederick alone. With this addition the whole framework\r\nof government was stereotyped by an ordinance of 1748.\r\n\r\nThe years 1746–1756 are notable for Frederick’s use of his machine\r\nrather than for the changes which he made in it. He now displayed\r\nin action the principles of domestic policy which were the fruit of\r\nhis early training and the guide of his later years. His ideal is as\r\nsimple to understand as it was difficult to realise in practice. He\r\nallowed his subjects to think as they pleased on condition that they\r\nacted as he pleased. Neither in home nor in foreign policy did the King\r\nrecognise any bounds to the assistance that he might demand from the\r\ndwellers within his dominions.\r\n\r\nThe main object of his foreign policy was to extend the borders of\r\nPrussia to the utmost limit consistent with the safety of the State.\r\nHis home policy was to bring within those borders the greatest possible\r\nnumber of men, to prevent them from falling below a certain moderate\r\nlevel of righteousness, comfort, and knowledge, to organise a huge\r\narmy, to collect a vast revenue, and to enable Prussia as far as\r\npossible to supply all the needs of every one of her people. Other\r\nstates were useful to her because they supplied recruits to her army,\r\nteachers for her artisans, and gold and silver in exchange for her\r\nsurplus manufactures. The gold and silver were drawn into the treasury\r\nby taxation and used to build villages, to establish new manufactures,\r\nto hire more soldiers, and to fill Frederick’s war-chest. Then, by\r\nwar or a display of force which made war superfluous, a new province\r\nwould be joined to Prussia and the routine of development, taxation,\r\narmament, and acquisition could begin anew.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Frederick regarded any single part of this\r\nprogramme as weightier than the rest. In spite of all his economies\r\nand accumulations he was no miser, cherishing money for its own sake.\r\nHe hoarded treasure so that his army might be sure of pay in time of\r\nwar and his subjects sure of help in case of devastating calamity.\r\nOn the same principle he maintained and added to the huge Government\r\ngranaries, which bought in years of plenty and sold, at high but not\r\nexorbitant prices, in years of dearth. Frederick did not refuse to\r\nmake some profit from the institution, but his main object was to\r\nconfer upon the State the inestimable boon of freedom from famine.\r\nThe establishment of public warehouses for wool, silk, and cotton was\r\nsimilarly designed to guard against glut and shortage. It was merely a\r\nnew adaptation of the policy of the Staple, which England had discarded\r\nat the end of the Middle Ages. But it secured a market to the Prussian\r\nproducer and an unfailing source of supply to the Prussian manufacturer\r\nand placed the whole traffic in raw materials under the supervision and\r\ncontrol of the State.\r\n\r\nFrederick is as little open to the charge of megalomania as to that of\r\navarice. He was singularly free from foibles. He frankly admits that\r\nthe adventure of 1740 was partly inspired by the desire to make himself\r\na name. But before the Peace of Dresden his lust of mere conquest seems\r\nto have been extinguished. Thenceforward his armaments and acquisitions\r\nwere strictly regulated by reasons of State, and in his conception of\r\nstatecraft domestic policy stood on a par with foreign. He likened\r\nthe Finances, Foreign Policy, and the Army to three steeds harnessed\r\nabreast to the car of State, and himself to the charioteer who directed\r\nthem and urged them on.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s most striking innovations in the department of home affairs\r\nwere made during his later years. It will therefore be necessary in\r\na subsequent chapter to give further illustrations of the working of\r\nhis principles and to calculate the results which he accomplished.\r\nAll through his reign, however, the process of internal improvement\r\nand interference was carried on in conformity with these ideas.\r\nAgriculture, as the basis of all, had the first claim upon the King’s\r\nattention, and he made unceasing efforts to render every acre of the\r\nland productive and to provide it with a cultivator. If in the course\r\nof his innumerable journeys he observed a waste place that seemed\r\ncapable of improvement he would commend it to the Provincial Chamber\r\nas a site for a certain number of new villages of a given size. If\r\nthe suggestion proved feasible it was carried out at the expense of\r\nthe State, which reaped its profit in course of time from the new\r\ntaxpayers, producers, and recruits, who were thus included in the\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe most signal of these victories in time of peace was the reclaiming\r\nof huge swamps lying along the Oder below Frankfurt, In July, 1747,\r\nthe King appointed commissioners, including the famous mathematician\r\nEuler, and placed troops at their disposal. The task demanded not only\r\ndams and drainage works, but also in parts excavation of a new bed for\r\nthe great river. It was urged forward by Frederick with all speed. He\r\noften inspected the works and exacted a report of their progress week\r\nby week. Boats were commandeered by force from the reluctant villagers.\r\nSome of those whose fishing rights were done away conjured the King,\r\n“falling at his feet,” so ran their petition, “most submissively in\r\ndeepest woe and dejection as a most terrified band fearing the fatal\r\nstroke,” that he would lay to heart the ruin which his measures would\r\ninevitably bring upon them. The King drily answered that they might let\r\nhim know when they had suffered any actual harm and compensated them\r\nwith reclaimed land.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1753 Frederick was able to make arrangements to people the\r\nnew province which he had thus conquered from the domain of Chaos. The\r\nlandowners, who had shared in the general opposition to the enterprise,\r\nwere compelled to resign to the State their claim to a large percentage\r\nof the reclaimed land and to provide a prescribed number of peasants\r\nfor the remainder. Born Prussians were as a rule declared ineligible,\r\nfor here was an opportunity of tempting valuable fresh blood into the\r\nState. Freedom from military service to the third generation, exemption\r\nfrom taxes for some years, and at first actual assistance were the\r\nterms offered to many immigrants. The result was that Frederick secured\r\nan influx of new subjects from far and wide. The Rhineland, Würtemburg,\r\nMecklenburg, Swedish Pomerania, Saxony, Bohemia, Poland, and the\r\nmountains of Austria—all sent contingents. He laid out more than\r\n500,000 thalers in all and secured a rental of 20,000. More than 250\r\nvillages were created. Thanks in great part to this policy of internal\r\ncolonisation, the numbers of the people steadily rose. At his accession\r\nFrederick had ruled over rather more than 2,200,000 people. Thirteen\r\nyears later the number in the old provinces had become more than\r\none-sixth greater, while East Frisia added 90,000 souls and Silesia\r\nsome 1,200,000 more. In 1756 the total exceeded 4,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe decade which followed the Peace of Dresden, though uneventful in\r\ncomparison with the periods of seven years which it divides, was thus\r\nby no means barren. For Frederick it was indeed a period of manifold\r\nactivity. It was signalised by the establishment of Sans Souci and by\r\nthe memorable visit of Voltaire. For three years (1750–1753) the King\r\nenjoyed the constant exchange of homage with the cynosure of the world\r\nof letters, who described his new home, Potsdam, as “Sparta and Athens\r\njoined in one, nothing but reviewing and poetry day by day.” Each of\r\nthe two friends revered the genius and despised the character of the\r\nother. The sequel was a desperate quarrel, and the flight and arrest of\r\nVoltaire. When he was suffered to pass beyond the reach of Frederick’s\r\nsceptre he strove to avenge himself with the pen which had lavished\r\nexquisite flattery upon the King for many years and which was often to\r\nresume the old style in the future.\r\n\r\nLiterary effort and witty company were, however, only the King’s solace\r\nin a life of labour. Day by day he scanned the political horizon,\r\nresolved to take no action which would not serve the State, and to\r\nshrink from nothing if Prussian interests were threatened. Day by\r\nday, too, he urged forward the labours of peace and the preparations\r\nfor war. While Silesia was being gradually assimilated and the old\r\nPrussia developed, Frederick was making use of his new possession, East\r\nFrisia, in a tardy and only moderately successful endeavour to further\r\ncommerce overseas. Commerce in Frederick’s opinion ranked far below\r\nagriculture and manufactures in value to a state with ideals such as\r\nthose which he had chosen for Prussia. He therefore devoted far more of\r\nhis energy to the task of forwarding Prussian industry, which he argued\r\ngave employment to a thousand times as many men, brought more gold and\r\nsilver into the country, and remained more amenable to State control.\r\nAt the same time he was steadily accumulating treasure and perfecting\r\nhis military force. In the fateful year 1756 he had upwards of\r\n14,000,000 thalers stored up for war. The standing army then numbered\r\nmore than 150,000 men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR TO THE BATTLE OF LEUTHEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the world knows that in 1756 the King of Prussia embarked upon a\r\nstruggle in comparison with which his previous wars might almost be\r\ncalled sham-fights. This was the Third Silesian War, commonly known\r\nas the Seven Years’ War, which Macaulay’s lurid prose depicts as\r\nsetting almost the whole globe on fire. The true cause of Austria’s new\r\nstruggle, not merely to regain Silesia, but also to curb the dangerous\r\npower of Prussia, will be patent to all who have followed the story\r\nof Frederick’s life. It was the memory of past wrong quickened by\r\napprehensions of worse to come. Maria Theresa could not believe that\r\nHeaven would suffer her despoiler to go unchastised, and she watched\r\nthe political horizon for signs that the day of vengeance upon him was\r\nat hand. At the same time all the neighbours of Prussia perceived with\r\nthat instinct which is the surest guide of states that the system to\r\nwhich they belonged was jeopardised by an intruding Power whose conduct\r\nhad been such as to justify a crusade against her.\r\n\r\nIn that age of unstable alliances and easy wars it was certain that\r\na conviction shared by so many states would sooner or later lead\r\nto action. It was equally certain that, while Frederick was king,\r\nPrussia would strike back. Hence we may regard with some indifference\r\nnice balancings of moral judgment upon the great fact of 1756, when\r\nFrederick suddenly made war upon Austria and treated Saxony with almost\r\ngreater violence. It seems idle to maintain that because Austria had\r\nyielded up Silesia by treaty she was debarred for ever from retaliating\r\nupon Frederick in the fashion which he had set. Who would apply such a\r\nrule to the problems of the present? If it be lawful, in our own day,\r\nfor France to hope to recover Alsace and Lorraine, or for Spain to hope\r\nto recover Gibraltar, it is not easy to understand why, in 1756, Maria\r\nTheresa might not lawfully hope to reverse the verdict of 1742 and\r\n1745. And if she and her neighbours contemplated something more than a\r\nrecovery of lands actually lost, if they sought to reduce the King of\r\nPrussia to the harmless level of a Margrave of Brandenburg, who can be\r\nindignant or even surprised? A new coalition against Frederick would be\r\nmerely the Austrian answer to his own riddle, “If I have an advantage,\r\nam I to use it or not?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE OF MARIA THERESA IN THE VIENNA\r\nHOFFBURG.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCED BY PERMISSION OF A. F. CZIHAKS NACHFLG, VIENNA.]\r\n\r\nBut if, as seems undeniable, Austria and her neighbours had good\r\ngrounds for hoping to attack Prussia, and if, as Frederick had reason\r\nto believe, the danger was becoming imminent in 1756, what could be\r\nmore futile than the statement that none the less he was not justified\r\nin striking the first blow? It is true that for reasons of current\r\npolitics the Austrian Chancellor, Kaunitz, schemed with success to\r\nshape events so as to make Prussia seem the aggressor, and that he\r\nthus established the conditions under which Austria could claim the\r\nfulfilment of a treaty of defensive alliance. At a distance of a\r\ncentury and a half, however, such subtleties can be appraised at\r\ntheir true value. Though in 1756 war emerges from as dense a cloud of\r\ndiplomacy as ever befogged the path of European history, our generation\r\nmay regard the Third Silesian War as the natural result of the original\r\naggression of Frederick and of the abiding interests of other Powers.\r\n\r\nThose interests, however, demand a brief explanation, for they\r\ndetermined the time and the form of a war which at some time and in\r\nsome form was inevitable from the very moment at which Austria and\r\nPrussia laid down their arms at Dresden. In an age when the true course\r\nof states was steered by kings and statesmen of whom some were lazy,\r\nsome self-seeking, some timid, some honestly mistaken in their designs,\r\nit was not to be expected that many should, like Prussia, make straight\r\nfor a definite goal. Since the Peace of Utrecht, Europe had lived in an\r\natmosphere of general uncertainty. Nations formed countless short-lived\r\ncomradeships for the pursuit of objects often transient. It was almost\r\nimpossible to forecast who, if war broke out, would be ranged on one\r\nside or the other, and hardly less difficult to forecast the side upon\r\nwhich those who had entered the war as allies of one of the combatants\r\nwould be found at the end of it. What might, however, be anticipated\r\nwith confidence was that few Powers would neglect the chance of profit\r\nwhich war afforded. Walpole’s famous boast, “There are fifty thousand\r\nmen slain in Europe this year and not one Englishman,” was called forth\r\nby his triumph in keeping clear of the War of the Polish Succession,\r\nwhich was not too remote to embroil every other Great Power.\r\n\r\nWhile there was then a tendency for every Power to share in every\r\nwar as an auxiliary if not as a principal, two alliances had become\r\ntraditional. Ever since the undue predominance of France first\r\nimperilled the liberties of Europe, England had steadily supported\r\nAustria against her. And so soon as the Great Elector showed that\r\nPrussia might be a serviceable ally, France strove to employ her with a\r\nview to the humiliation of Austria. Though only occasionally successful\r\nin engaging Prussia, she continued to regard her as a natural ally.\r\nThus each of the maritime and commercial rivals of the West had its\r\n_liaison_ with one of the German Land Powers of the East.\r\n\r\nMore to be reckoned on than these connexions were, however, three\r\ngreat antipathies which the course of history had revealed. The clash\r\nof interest between Austria and Prussia seemed destined to distract\r\nGermany until one or other proved supreme, and, so long as Maria\r\nTheresa confronted Frederick, it would be made harsher by a duel\r\nbetween the sovereigns. Russia, while Elizabeth ruled, would go with\r\nAustria. The giant State whose westward path had been marked out by\r\nPeter the Great already discerned in Prussia the athlete braced to\r\ndispute the way. Ost-Preussen was always a tempting bait, and long ere\r\nthis an ambassador at Frederick’s Court reported that the King feared\r\nRussia more than his God. None the less Frederick had permitted his\r\nsharp tongue to goad the luxurious Czarina into a fury which surpassed\r\nthat of the Queen whom he had robbed of Silesia. In April, 1756, the\r\nAustrian ambassador at St. Petersburg was informed that Russia was\r\nready to co-operate in an immediate attack upon Prussia by sending\r\n80,000 men, and that she would not lay down her arms until Maria\r\nTheresa had recovered Silesia and Glatz.\r\n\r\nThe jealousy of the rival states in Germany and the wrath of the\r\ndespot who swayed the policy of Russia would count for much in the\r\ncoming war. Weightier still was the struggle between France and\r\nEngland for the primacy in three continents and on the seas. This\r\ngreat national duel had been begun by William III. and brilliantly\r\ncontinued by Marlborough. During the pacific rule of Walpole, when\r\nthe two countries were nominally in alliance, England was gaining\r\nstrength and taking up a position in America and India which her\r\nrival could not witness unmoved. The close league formed by France\r\nwith Spain, the monopolist of the New World, rendered lasting peace\r\nwith England impossible and even Walpole was forced into war. This\r\nwar, known as the War of Jenkins’ Ear, began with an attack on the\r\nSpaniards in 1739, and developed into a world-wide struggle with the\r\nFrench in which Dettingen and Fontenoy were incidents. The settlement\r\nat Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, which put an end to it, was obviously a\r\nmere breathing-space. In the early fifties hostilities broke out anew\r\nbetween the English and French in India and North America, and it could\r\nhardly be doubted that Europe would soon catch fire.\r\n\r\nIn 1756, therefore, war between France and England had already begun,\r\nand war between Frederick and his two Imperial neighbours was imminent.\r\nThe custom of Europe and the precedent of the former struggle made it\r\nin the highest degree unlikely that these wars would be kept apart.\r\nWhat would be the connexion between them? The answer was determined by\r\nthree accidents. The King of England happened to be Elector of Hanover,\r\nthe ruling spirit at Vienna happened to be Kaunitz, and the mistress of\r\nLouis XV. happened to be Madame de Pompadour.\r\n\r\nHanover, argued George II., will certainly be attacked by the French.\r\nIt must be defended at all costs. The only possible defenders are\r\nAustria, Russia, and Prussia. Austria, the old patron of Hanover, would\r\nbe preferable. But the Queen has grievances against England and is\r\nbent on attacking Prussia. Alliance with her would therefore expose\r\nHanover to the Prussians as well as to the French, and must therefore\r\nbe regarded as out of the question. Russia and Prussia remained to be\r\nconsidered. Russia actually made a convention to hire out troops for\r\nthe defence of Hanover. But Russia, the King found, also desired to\r\nattack Prussia, and was therefore as ineligible an ally as Austria.\r\nOnly the Prussian alliance remained possible. In January, 1756, by the\r\nConvention of Westminster, it was secured.\r\n\r\nThe Convention of Westminster, by which Frederick bound himself to\r\ndefend Hanover against attack, helped on the far more difficult task of\r\nKaunitz. This was no less than to reverse the secular policy of France\r\nand Austria and to bring Bourbon and Hapsburg into alliance. Kaunitz\r\nbased his calculations on the assumption that France might help Austria\r\nto recover Silesia, but that England never would. This view of the\r\npolitical situation was urged for seven years with great ability by\r\na statesman in whom the Queen reposed a confidence greater than that\r\nwith which our own Elizabeth honoured Burleigh, and who treated her in\r\nreturn with a haughtiness such as Essex would never have dared to show.\r\nKaunitz, whose life was spent in the endeavour to exalt the power of\r\nhis mistress, forced her to shut her windows to humour his prejudice\r\nagainst fresh air, and stalked out of her Council when she interrupted\r\nhim with a question. At another meeting, it is said, she remonstrated\r\nwith him on his riotous living. He replied that he had come there to\r\ndiscuss her affairs, not his own.\r\n\r\nBut the great, it is said, are known to the great, and Maria Theresa’s\r\nconfidence in Kaunitz seemed to be justified when his visionary\r\nscheme proved feasible. It was easy to form a league to despoil\r\nPrussia. Kaunitz tempted Russia with parts of Poland, Poland with an\r\nindemnity in Ost-Preussen, Saxony with Magdeburg, Sweden with Prussian\r\nPomerania, the princes of the Empire with the favours which the Emperor\r\nalone could bestow. But it required great powers of imagination to\r\nconceive that France might quit the beaten track of history, which was\r\nat the same time plainly the path of self-interest, in order to assist\r\nher hereditary foe in a great land-war at a time when she needed all\r\nher strength to meet England upon the seas.\r\n\r\nKaunitz had not only the strength to see this vision, but also the\r\nfortune to realise it in fact. The circumstance that favoured him the\r\nmost was that the Pompadour was now at the height of her influence in\r\nFrance. The mistress of Louis XV. furthered the plan of Kaunitz for\r\nselfish reasons, but in the expectation that its result would be the\r\nexact reverse of what it was. She desired to keep the peace in Europe\r\nin order that she might continue to live quietly at Versailles. The\r\nMinister of Marine, moreover, was her friend; the minister who might\r\nprofit by a land-war was her enemy. She therefore favoured a covenant\r\nof neutrality with Austria in the hope that the two wars would thus be\r\nkept apart.\r\n\r\nThe Convention of Westminster, however, made it impossible that the\r\naffair should rest here. The fact that Prussia had bound herself to\r\nresist a French invasion of Hanover frustrated all Frederick’s efforts\r\nto propitiate the Pompadour and to throw dust in the eyes of the French.\r\n\r\n    “If the ministry of France will consider it well,” wrote\r\n    Frederick on January 24th, “... it should find nothing to say\r\n    in reason if I undertake such a convention, by which, moreover,\r\n    I flatter myself that I render an essential service to France,\r\n    seeing that I shall certainly arrest 50,000 Russians by it, and\r\n    shall hold in check another 50,000 Austrians at least, who but\r\n    for that would all have acted against France.”\r\n\r\nHe further endeavoured to discount his alliance with George II. by\r\nturning a sympathetic ear to the French plans for assisting the Young\r\nPretender, and by advising her to strike in Ireland and on the south\r\ncoast of England at the same time. It was beyond his art, however, to\r\ndisguise what he had done, and Kaunitz knew how to profit by it.\r\n\r\nThe labours of the diplomatists were immense, but at last they were\r\nsuccessful. On May 1, 1756, by the Treaty of Versailles, both France\r\nand Austria undertook for the future to defend the European possessions\r\nof the other with 24,000 men. In the war with England, Austria was\r\nto remain neutral, but if in the course of it any province of France\r\nin Europe were to be attacked by any ally or auxiliary of England,\r\nAustria promised by a secret article to provide the stipulated\r\nassistance and France offered a similar guarantee. This might be\r\ninterpreted as binding Austria to join in the war if the French were\r\nmasters of Hanover and the Prussians marched against them. It thus\r\ndeprived the Convention of Westminster of half its value, and at the\r\nsame time threatened to connect the war against England, which France\r\nhad begun brilliantly at Minorca, with the war against Prussia, for\r\nwhich Elizabeth was clamouring. Negotiations for a still closer union\r\nbetween Austria and France were pressed on, and Kaunitz hoped that in\r\n1757 all would be ready.\r\n\r\nToo much was, however, in the wind for Frederick’s keen scent to be\r\nentirely baffled. Austria, indeed, sincerely desired peace for the\r\npresent. The published articles of the Treaty of Versailles were\r\ninnocent. The English ministry disingenuously tried to lull the\r\nprotector of Hanover into false security by assurances that they\r\ncould answer for Russia. But the King of Prussia had his own sources\r\nof information as well as the most perfect faith in the malevolence\r\nof his fellow-men. For three years and a half one Menzel, a clerk in\r\nthe Saxon Foreign Office, had been furnishing him with copies of the\r\nsecret state-papers of Augustus. The whole truth about the negotiations\r\nagainst Prussia was not known at Dresden, but enough reached Frederick\r\nfrom this source to impress upon him the desirability of anticipating\r\nhis foes. So early as June 23, 1756, he sent to General Lehwaldt,\r\nin Königsberg, three sets of instructions, military, economic, and\r\nsecret, for dealing with the anticipated Russian invasion, and even for\r\nnegotiations with a view to peace.\r\n\r\n    “You know already,” wrote the King, “how I have allied myself\r\n    with England, and that thereupon the Austrian court, from\r\n    hatred of my successful convention with England, took the\r\n    course of allying itself with France. It is true that Russia\r\n    has concluded a subsidy-treaty with England, but I have every\r\n    reason to believe that it will be broken by Russia and that\r\n    she has joined the Austrian party and concerted with her a\r\n    threatening plan. But all this would not have caused me to\r\n    move if it had not been brought to my notice through many\r\n    channels and also by the march of Russian and Austrian troops\r\n    that this concert is directed against myself.”\r\n\r\nFrederick probably told the truth to his commander-in-chief in\r\nOst-Preussen. On the same day Sir Andrew Mitchell, the shrewd and\r\nhonest Scotchman who then represented England at the court of Prussia,\r\nhad an audience with the King. He reported that, notwithstanding the\r\ngreat number of enemies, the King seemed in no wise disconcerted, and\r\nhad already given orders everywhere. “In a fortnight’s time he will\r\nbe ready to act. His troops, as I am informed, are complete, and the\r\nartillery in excellent order.”\r\n\r\nOn the eve of war, then, Frederick’s sword was as sharp as of old\r\nand his courage as high. He soon showed that his pen had not lost\r\nits cunning. At the end of June he indicted his enemy before the\r\njudgment-seat of England. Austria regarded her new connexions, so\r\nstated his clever memoir, as the triumvirate of Augustus, Antony, and\r\nLepidus. The three courts, like the three Romans of old, had sacrificed\r\ntheir friends to each other.\r\n\r\n    “The Empress abandoned England and Holland to the resentment\r\n    of France, and the court of Versailles sacrificed Prussia to\r\n    the ambition of the Empress. The latter proposes to imitate\r\n    the conduct of Augustus, who used the power of his colleagues\r\n    to aggrandise himself and then overthrew them one by one. The\r\n    court of Vienna has three designs towards which her present\r\n    steps are tending—to establish her despotism in the Empire,\r\n    to ruin the Protestant cause, and to reconquer Silesia. She\r\n    regards the King of Prussia as the great obstacle to her vast\r\n    designs.”\r\n\r\nThus Frederick claimed to be the champion of the balance of power and\r\nof Protestantism, and proposed to solicit not only Denmark and Holland,\r\nbut even the Turk and the Empire for aid. His appeal to England\r\nconcluded with the assurance that Prussia was not cast down. “Three\r\nthings can restore the equilibrium of Europe—a close and intimate\r\nconnexion between our two courts, earnest efforts to form new alliances\r\nand to foil the schemes of the enemy, and boldness to face the greatest\r\ndangers.”\r\n\r\nA paper of this kind, brilliant, concise, astute, and even eloquent, is\r\nworth many thousand lines of the rhymed platitudes by which the author\r\nset greater store. We might expect to hear that it was followed at\r\nonce by a spring at the throat of the enemy. It is true that Kaunitz,\r\nwho was not yet ready for war, and who wished that if war must come\r\nFrederick should be the aggressor, held the Russians back. But he was\r\npressing forward warlike preparations in Bohemia and Moravia, and\r\nFrederick was not likely to ignore the advantage of striking swiftly\r\nand of waging war outside his own borders. The military men, when they\r\nsaw the evidence in the King’s hands, were all for action. “Schwerin,”\r\nsays Carlyle, “much a Cincinnatus since we last saw him, has laid down\r\nhis plough again, a fervid ‘little Marlborough’ of seventy-two.” He\r\nurged the immediate seizure of Saxony, as a base of operations against\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\nCooler heads, indeed, counselled Frederick to have patience. On behalf\r\nof England, a Power always singularly dispassionate when the interests\r\nof a German ally were at stake, Mitchell urged that many chances of\r\nwar and politics might swiftly change the face of affairs, and that\r\nto attack Austria would give unnecessary provocation to France. The\r\nfaithful Podewils ventured to spend a summer afternoon at Potsdam in\r\nlabouring to turn the King from his purpose. In his letter of July 22,\r\n1756, to Eichel, he speaks of the “respectful freedom” with which he\r\nbegged the King not to drive France and Russia to do what they had no\r\ndesire to do that year if Austria were not attacked. Let him rather\r\nuse the ten months’ grace before the next campaign in securing allies\r\nwithin and without the Empire, in trying to reconcile France and\r\nEngland, and in preparing an imposing defence.\r\n\r\n“But all this,” says the poor man, “was completely rejected as arising\r\nfrom far too great timidity, and at last I was dismissed coldly enough\r\nwith the words, ‘_Adieu, Monsieur de la timide politique_.’” His\r\nconcluding phrases, however, have in them so much of prophecy that they\r\nmay be cited here.\r\n\r\n    “That it was not doubtful that progress and success might at\r\n    first be brilliant, but that the complication of enemies, at\r\n    a time when the King was isolated and deprived of all foreign\r\n    help, which had never happened to him yet, at least in regard\r\n    to the diversions which had been made in his favour in the two\r\n    preceding wars, would, perhaps, make him remember one day what\r\n    I took the respectful liberty of representing to him for _the\r\n    last time_.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the literal rendering of the French into which Podewils, who\r\nwrites the bulk of his letter in a jargon of German, French, and Latin,\r\nforces his tortuous German thoughts.\r\n\r\nFrederick, indeed, seems already to have passed the stage at which he\r\ncould be influenced by argument. An agile rather than a deep thinker,\r\nhe reached at times a point at which calculation became agony and the\r\nonly remedy was action. Now, as in his earlier adventure, “pressed with\r\nmany doubts, he wakes the drumming guns that have no doubts.” That a\r\nmere Prussian minister should combat his plans seemed to him little\r\nshort of _lèse-majesté_. Nor could he be moved by those who were not so\r\ntightly bound to the car of Prussia. Mitchell followed Podewils with\r\narguments, and Valori, the French ambassador, followed Mitchell with\r\nthreats. Frederick’s answer was a series of blunt questions pressed\r\nhome twice over at Vienna—Have you a treaty with Russia against me? Why\r\nare you arming? Will you solemnly declare that you do not intend to\r\nattack me this year or next? The final answer was received on August\r\n25, 1756. Next day the Prussians invaded Saxony.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years’ War had begun. Needless to say, every movement of the\r\nPrussians had been planned out long before. The army was under orders\r\nwhich enforced the most perfect mobility. A hundred supernumeraries\r\nhad been added to every regiment. On the 13th to 15th August Frederick\r\nissued directions that the secret of their destination was to be\r\nstrictly kept from the troops. They were to take with them provisions\r\nfor nine days, every cavalryman carrying three days’ supply of hay, and\r\nevery infantryman three days’ supply of bread, while bread for six days\r\nwas placed in the single baggage-cart allowed to each company. None of\r\nthis reserve of food was, however, to be broken into save in the utmost\r\nneed, and no officer of any rank whatever might have table utensils of\r\nnobler metal than tin.\r\n\r\nA word would set all in swift motion, but the machine had to be\r\narrested until it should be known that the Prussian ultimatum was\r\nrejected. Klinggräffen, Frederick’s ambassador at Vienna, caused some\r\ndelay by asking for instructions. On the 24th the King wrote to General\r\nWinterfeldt, the most impatient advocate of war: “The cursed courier is\r\nnot yet here, so I have been compelled to stop the regiments till the\r\n28th. Klinggräffen deserves to be made a porter by way of punishment.\r\nSuch stupid tricks are unpardonable and the prolonged uncertainty is\r\nunbearable.” On the 26th, however, after hearing from Vienna, the King\r\nwas able to set all in motion anew.\r\n\r\n    “The answer,” he wrote to his brother, the Prince of Prussia,\r\n    “is impertinent, high, and contemptuous, and as for the\r\n    assurances that I asked of them, not a word, so that the sword\r\n    alone can cut this Gordian knot.... At present, we must think\r\n    only of making war in such a fashion as to deprive our enemies\r\n    of the desire to break the peace too soon.”\r\n\r\nWhile one royal messenger was bearing this message from Potsdam to\r\nBerlin, others were on their way to Vienna, to Dresden, and to\r\nevery division of the Prussian army. Klinggräffen was instructed to\r\nreturn a third time to the charge, with the final offer that if the\r\nEmpress-Queen would declare definitely that she would not attack\r\nFrederick that year or the next, the troops now moving should be\r\nrecalled. More profit was, however, expected from the message to the\r\nSaxon Court. King Augustus, or Count Brühl, was to be informed, “with\r\nevery expression of my affection and of your respect that good breeding\r\ncan supply,” that Frederick was compelled by the Court of Vienna to\r\nenter Saxony with his army in order to pass into Bohemia.\r\n\r\n    “The estates of the King of Saxony,” continued the royal\r\n    missive, “will be spared as far as present circumstances allow.\r\n    My troops will behave there with perfect order and discipline,\r\n    but I am obliged to take precautions so as not to fall again\r\n    into the position in which the Saxon Court placed me during the\r\n    years 1744 and 1745.... I desire nothing more ardently than to\r\n    behold the happy moment of peace, so that I may prove to this\r\n    Prince the full extent of my friendship, and place him once\r\n    more in the tranquil possession of all his estates, against\r\n    which I have never had any hostile design.”\r\n\r\nThis declaration was addressed to a ruler who had made no engagements\r\nhostile to Frederick, and who now offered to observe perfect neutrality\r\nand to allow his troops to pass. A commentary upon it is supplied\r\nby a document which was probably drawn up several days earlier, and\r\nwhich was soon to be put in force. By this “instruction” for the\r\nadministration of Saxony during the war, “in order that His Majesty\r\nmay not leave a highly dangerous enemy in his rear,” the Prussian\r\nminister von Borcke is directed to suspend the native administration\r\nof the land and to substitute a Prussian Directory of War. The Saxon\r\nroyal revenue, it is said, amounts to about six million thalers, but\r\nFrederick “will be contented with five million, so that the inhabitants\r\nmay be solaced thereby.” In other respects the order and temperance\r\nwhich distinguished the Prussian Government were to be applied to the\r\nsubjects of Augustus. Such was Frederick’s plan for the future of\r\nSaxony, a would-be neutral, during the war.\r\n\r\nThe problem which the King set himself was to cripple Austria before\r\nRussia or France could come to her assistance. Austria had assembled\r\nforces in Moravia and in Bohemia. If Frederick attacked the former\r\nthe Bohemian army might cut off his retreat. He therefore directed\r\nSchwerin to guard Silesia while he himself converted Saxony into a base\r\nfor the invasion of Bohemia. From the Saxons he expected little or no\r\nopposition. He therefore proposed to march in three columns upon Pirna,\r\na fortress situated at the point at which the Elbe bursts through the\r\nmountain-wall of Bohemia to enter the fertile plains of Saxony. Then,\r\nwith a granary and a highway behind him, he would follow the river into\r\nBohemia as far as Melnik, less than twenty miles north of Prague, where\r\nit ceases to be navigable. He would thus at the very least have gained\r\na commanding position on the further side of the mountains.\r\n\r\n    “As he does not think that the Austrians will soon be ready to\r\n    attack him,” wrote Mitchell on August 27th, “he imagines they\r\n    will throw in a strong garrison into Prague, that [_sic_] as\r\n    the winter approaches, he can have good quarters in Bohemia,\r\n    which will disorder the finances at Vienna and perhaps render\r\n    that court more reasonable.”\r\n\r\nTo the ambassador of England Frederick made light of his enterprise and\r\ninsisted that it would permit him, if necessary, to defend Hanover. But\r\nit is difficult not to surmise that he looked for a great campaign. The\r\ncapture of Prague, the rout of the army of Bohemia, and the seizure of\r\nits magazines—all this would be a fitting sequel to the coercion of\r\nSaxony. It was not too grave a task for the main host of Prussia.\r\n\r\nEven the lesser scheme failed, however, because Augustus, though a\r\nweakling, was a man of honour. His army was less than twenty thousand\r\nstrong, but it sufficed to hold Pirna and to block the highway of the\r\nElbe. On September 9, 1756, Frederick entered Dresden, but Augustus\r\nhad fled to the army and lay safe in the impregnable rock-fortress of\r\nKönigstein. While the invader was rifling his archives for proofs of\r\na great conspiracy against Prussia, he offered to observe the most\r\nbenevolent neutrality and begged for an exact statement of what more\r\ncould be expected from him. He received the answer on September 14th\r\nfrom the lips of Frederick’s favourite, Winterfeldt. It was nothing\r\nless than that he should join Prussia in attacking Maria Theresa.\r\n\r\n“How can I turn my arms against a Princess who has given me no cause\r\nfor complaint, and to whom, in virtue of an old defensive alliance of\r\nwhich Your Majesty is aware, I ought to furnish 6000 auxiliaries, only\r\nthat it is doubtful whether the present war is a case of aggression?”\r\nSuch was the old King’s reply to the Prussian tempter, and he coupled\r\nwith it renewed assurances of neutrality. Frederick reiterated his\r\ndemands and expressed regret that he could not extend complaisance\r\nfurther. By no effort of diplomacy could he shake the honourable\r\nfirmness of Augustus, and it was therefore necessary to gain the\r\nhighroad into Bohemia by force.\r\n\r\nFrederick had surrounded Pirna, but he did not venture to assault it,\r\nthough Napoleon declared at first sight that there were nine points of\r\nattack. It was clear, however, that hunger must soon force the Saxons\r\nto move and that their only hope lay in succour from the Austrians.\r\nBrowne, the Irishman who had proved himself to be one of the Queen’s\r\nbest generals, therefore led an army northward to the foot of the\r\nmountains and was confronted by Frederick in person at Lobositz. On\r\nOctober 1, 1756, a fierce fight of seven hours proved indecisive.\r\nEarly in the day the King sent twenty squadrons of horse to meet\r\ndisaster at the hands of the Austrian gunners, and later the Prussian\r\ninfantry showed that they were still the men of Mollwitz and of Soor.\r\nThe Prussians kept the field of battle, but of nearly 6400 killed and\r\nwounded more than half were theirs.\r\n\r\nThe relief of Pirna was checked but not frustrated. Lobositz is,\r\nhowever, chiefly memorable as the day on which the Austrians first\r\nencountered the Prussians at their best and were not beaten. It is no\r\nmore than Frederick’s due to remark that the troops whom he had now\r\nto face were men who had learned what his father’s army had to teach.\r\nThey had adopted the Old Dessauer’s iron ramrod, and the swiftness of\r\ntheir fire was no longer less than the half of their opponents’. Their\r\nartillery, thanks to the labours of Prince Lichtenstein, was always\r\ngood and not seldom superior to the Prussian.\r\n\r\nIn little more than a fortnight after Lobositz the campaign of 1756 was\r\nat an end. On October 11th, Browne reached Schandau, on the right bank\r\nof the Elbe, where he expected the starving Saxons to join him. They\r\nwere not ready, and after waiting two days he was compelled to retreat.\r\nThe failure of the relieving expedition sealed the fate of Augustus’s\r\narmy. On October 17th, the rank and file laid down their arms—only to\r\nbe compelled, in defiance of the terms of surrender, to take them up\r\nagain as soldiers of the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nAugustus, however, did not suffer martyrdom in vain. He lost his army\r\nand his Electorate, but his “ovine obstinacy” ruined the attack upon\r\nthe Queen. In the hour of triumph Frederick wrote to Schwerin: “As for\r\nour stay in Bohemia, it is impossible for either of us to establish\r\na sure footing there this year, for we have entered the province too\r\nlate. We must confine ourselves to covering Silesia and Saxony.” Both\r\nPrussians and Austrians tacitly agreed to postpone the decisive blow\r\ntill the new campaign.\r\n\r\nTo balance the gain and loss which Frederick owed to his preference\r\nof his own plan to the “timid policy” of Podewils we must take into\r\naccount wider considerations of war and politics. By treating Saxony\r\nin Hohenzollern fashion, without scruple and without riot, the King\r\nundoubtedly gained some advantages. He found in the archives at Dresden\r\nthe material for yet another manifesto to Europe. He tested and\r\ninspired his army, which only knew that under his leadership it had won\r\na battle, captured an army, and conquered a state. He even increased\r\nits numbers by forcing the vanquished Saxons into the ranks. Above all,\r\nhe won security for the western flank of Silesia and a safe base from\r\nwhich to attack Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBut all this was purchased at a great price in material and moral\r\nstrength. Prussia was still a Power which had to ask herself whether\r\nshe could bear a second or a third campaign. To raise new taxes was\r\ndifficult if not impossible. Frederick, it might almost be said, paid\r\nfor the war out of his own pocket with the help of his allies and of\r\nthe enemy. Already he showed some signs of being pressed for money.\r\nIn the middle of September he made secret arrangements for borrowing\r\n300,000 thalers from a house of business in Berlin. Soon the Saxon\r\nofficials were told that their pay must fall into arrear and Frederick\r\nobserves with some brutality that Augustus, who had retired to his\r\nsecond capital at Warsaw, could support his queen and her household\r\nin Saxony from the French and Austrian subsidies. He thus denied to\r\nthe victim that courtesy for his family which he had ostentatiously\r\npromised from the first.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether 14,000 pressed men, even though some of\r\nthem might otherwise have found their way to the enemy, compensated\r\nPrussia for the loyal veterans who fell at Lobositz. Throughout the war\r\nFrederick found no servants less reliable than the Saxons whom he had\r\nimpressed and no foes more bitter than their countrymen who escaped.\r\nAs for Saxony itself, it is true that if war must come, which Podewils\r\nregarded as dubious, Prussia derived much strength from her possession\r\nof it. But Frederick’s treatment of Saxony removed all possibility\r\nof escaping not only from a war, but from war upon the scale that he\r\nprofessed to expect. The spectacle of the suffering King inflamed\r\nall his enemies. As an exile in Warsaw Augustus was a more valuable\r\nally to Austria than he could have been in Dresden. He made it absurd\r\nfor Frederick to pose as the defender of German princes against the\r\nHapsburg. In January, 1757, a majority of those princes, assembled in\r\nDiet at Ratisbon, solemnly commissioned the Hapsburg to marshal their\r\ncorporate might against the Prussian aggressor.\r\n\r\nFrederick had treated the defensive alliance between the two Empresses\r\nas a conspiracy against himself. Early in February it became such;\r\nsave that what he might once have termed a conspiracy now wore the\r\naspect of a crusade. All the North was summoned to unite with Austria\r\nin curbing Prussia for ever, and Russia bound herself to keep 80,000\r\nmen in the field until the lost provinces had been regained. Frederick\r\nhad even performed what Kaunitz and the Pompadour could not completely\r\naccomplish. France now gave in her whole-hearted adhesion to the league\r\nfor the recovery of Silesia and Glatz. She pledged herself to pay\r\nAustria a heavy annual subsidy, to place 105,000 French troops in the\r\nfield, and to enlist 10,000 Germans. The history of the negotiations,\r\nwhich were prolonged till May 1, 1757, shows how real were the\r\ndifficulties to be overcome before Bourbon and Hapsburg could unite.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1757, when the new campaign began, Frederick thus stood face\r\nto face with what it is hardly an exaggeration to term a world in\r\narms. He, and no other, had brought Prussia to this pass. A coalition\r\nunprecedented in history was the result of the aggressions of 1740 and\r\n1756. All the world believed that the hour of reckoning had struck\r\nand that the Third Silesian War would bring the punishment from which\r\nchance had delivered the King who made the First.\r\n\r\nTo the biographer of Frederick, 1757 is welcome, for Frederick now\r\nbegins to be a hero. Had a chance bullet at Lobositz struck him down,\r\nthe world would have known only a king who promised to bring in a new\r\nera of government, but who owed to his father’s work and methods the\r\nchief part of whatever success he achieved. For creative power he\r\nwould have taken rank below the Great Elector and Frederick William,\r\nfor military renown below the Old Dessauer and Schwerin; for the\r\naggrandisement of his House, who knows? for who can calculate what\r\nhavoc the Coalition of 1757 would have wrought with his dominions?\r\nThe Frederick who had bequeathed to Prussia several volumes of prose\r\nand verse in French and the memory of sixteen years’ tenure of Silesia\r\nwould hardly be known to fame as Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nIn 1757, however, he takes his stand for the existence of Prussia.\r\nAt the moment that the military balance turns against him the moral\r\nbalance turns in his favour. Courage, energy, resource, determination,\r\nall displayed through a score of lifetimes, if sensations rather than\r\nmoments make up life,—Frederick is the embodiment of these things\r\nduring the next six years. At first it is his daring that seems to\r\neclipse all else. If Frederick feared not God, neither did he regard\r\nman. Far from being dazzled by the array of sceptres marshalled against\r\nhim, he determined to strike before his foes could form.\r\n\r\nWith the first breath of spring he despatched three royal princes and\r\nthe Duke of Bevern against four several points in Bohemia. “If those\r\nfalse attacks have so far succeeded as to cover the King of Prussia’s\r\nreal intention,” writes Mitchell on April 18th, “I may venture to say\r\nthat His Prussian Majesty is upon the point of executing one of the\r\nboldest and one of the greatest designs that ever was attempted by\r\nman.” Just at this juncture a plot against his life was discovered. “I\r\nthink upon the whole His Prussian Majesty has had a very narrow escape,\r\nwhich however seems to have made no impression at all upon him, nor to\r\nhave created in him the least diffidence whatever of anybody.” Such is\r\nhis Scotch friend’s account of the King at the outset of the chequered\r\ncampaign to which he owes the immensity of his fame.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s courage was not foolhardiness, for the very reason that he\r\nwas one, and his enemies were many. Every coalition must encounter the\r\ndifficulty of concerting a plan of campaign acceptable to all and the\r\nstill greater difficulty of securing honest and punctual co-operation.\r\nThe coalition against Frederick had the advantage that several of its\r\nmembers could serve the common cause by following the course most\r\nprofitable to themselves. The Russians might be expected to overrun\r\nOst-Preussen and the Swedes to attack Prussian Pomerania with the\r\nbest will in the world, while the Austrians had every incentive to be\r\nvigorous in the conquest of Silesia. But France consented to help to\r\nmake Silesia and Glatz Austrian chiefly in order that she might secure\r\nAustrian help nearer to her own borders. The motley forces of the\r\nEmpire had little interest in the quarrel, and the activity of Russia\r\ndepended upon a czarina whose health was bad. Speed and secrecy were\r\nalike unattainable by a machine which could be set in motion only after\r\ndebate between the Board of War at Vienna, the corrupt and factious\r\nCourt at St. Petersburg, and the inharmonious ministers of France.\r\nOnce set in motion, however, the gigantic machine seemed irresistible.\r\nKaunitz could launch battalions against Prussia from every point of the\r\ncompass. Although a new English minister, William Pitt, seemed disposed\r\nto stand by Frederick, it might well be thought incredible that\r\nPrussia could escape destruction at the hands of such a multitude.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s plain course was to make use of the speed and secrecy for\r\nwhich the Prussian movements were famous. The Queen was massing troops\r\nin Bohemia. She had determined to raise 150,000 men, but with sisterly\r\npartiality she halved their effectiveness by appointing Prince Charles\r\nto the command. This appointment favoured the plan which Mitchell\r\nadmired so highly. Frederick was devising a new form of the manœuvre by\r\nwhich he decoyed the Austrians to Hohenfriedberg. He was so successful\r\nthat everyone on the Austrian side believed that his one object was to\r\nmaintain himself in Saxony. To them the four sham-invasions of Bohemia\r\nseemed to be designed to conceal the King’s defensive operations and\r\nto paralyse their own attack. The illusion was strengthened because at\r\nthe same time they learned that Torgau and Dresden were being fortified\r\nin all haste and that barricades were rising on the roads from Bohemia\r\ninto Saxony. The last thing that they could suspect was that Frederick\r\nwas on the eve of attacking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEOPOLD, COUNT VON DAUN.\r\n\r\nFROM A COPPER PRINT.]\r\n\r\nThe result was that the movement planned for the previous autumn was\r\nnow carried out in the face of 133,000 Austrians. Frederick’s three\r\ncolumns issued from Saxony, Schwerin came from Silesia, and before the\r\nend of April 117,000 Prussians were encamped in Bohemia. In the face\r\nof such a force the astonished Austrians abandoned the magazines which\r\nthey had stored for the conquest of Saxony and fell back on Prague.\r\nHaving occupied a strong position to the east of the city, Prince\r\nCharles awaited the arrival of Field-Marshal Daun, who was advancing\r\nfrom the south.\r\n\r\nNow the Prussians were to learn that a royal command has drawbacks.\r\nFrederick was burning to attack the enemy. He had staked the success\r\nof the campaign on the chance of a pitched battle, and the timid\r\ntactics of Prince Charles filled him with impatience. At his back\r\nwas the finest army in the world. He was opposed by cavalry who had\r\nnever beaten their Prussian opponents since Mollwitz, by infantry\r\nwho had never beaten them at all, and by a general whom he despised.\r\nPreferring, as usual, the boldest course, he crossed to the eastern\r\nside of the river Moldau, which runs through Prague, and signalled to\r\nSchwerin to join him.\r\n\r\nPrince Charles did not venture to oppose a movement by which the\r\nenemy’s force was made almost equal in number to his own. Such\r\ninertness could be justified only if he believed either that he was\r\nvery weak or that his situation was impregnable and that Daun’s\r\narrival would make him sure of victory. His position indeed was strong\r\nenough to have given pause to a general less impatient than the King\r\nof Prussia. All Frederick’s royal authority had to be exerted before\r\nSchwerin would consent that 64,000 men, of whom the half had been\r\nmarching since midnight, should attack a strongly fortified position\r\nheld by 60,000 of the enemy. But the vanguard of Daun’s 30,000 was\r\nwithin ten miles of the capital and Frederick had his way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF PRAGUE, MAY 6, 1757.]\r\n\r\nHis forlorn hope at Prague on May 6, 1757, was to cost more blood than\r\nhad been spilled on any field in Europe for nearly fifty years. The\r\nPrussians began by marching with great skill round the Austrian right.\r\nBrowne, however, suggested an effective counter-manœuvre, so that when\r\nSchwerin assailed the flank at ten o’clock he did so under unsuspected\r\ndisadvantages of ground. “The cavalry began the encounter, and after\r\nseveral fruitless attacks Zieten with the reserve overthrew the\r\nAustrian cavalry. In the pursuit, however, his troops came upon one of\r\nthe enemy’s camps and drank so deep that they were of no more use that\r\nday.” Such is the statement of Schäfer, the Prussian historian of the\r\nwar. At the same time the infantry of the first line pressed forward,\r\nbut found that the way to the enemy lay through the treacherous slime\r\nof fishponds coated with green, which Frederick in his haste had taken\r\nto be meadow-land. They struggled across unharmed, but the well-served\r\nAustrian batteries began to destroy them at a range of 400 paces. Then\r\ntheir onslaught was shattered by the Austrian grenadiers, and Schwerin,\r\nas he seized the colours to rally his men, was slain by a blast of\r\ngrape-shot. The Austrian grenadiers began a triumphant counter-charge,\r\nbut they were unsupported, for their army had now no leader. Browne had\r\nfallen early in the charge, and Prince Charles collapsed in wrestling\r\nwith problems too great for his powers. The Prussian second line was\r\ntherefore able to repair the disaster of the first, and, after a\r\nterrible struggle at close quarters, they stormed the heights and\r\nwon the battle. Many of the Austrians fled southwards across the river\r\nSazawa, but the greater number took refuge behind the walls of Prague.\r\n\r\nIn the battle itself Frederick played the part of a brave and skilful\r\nleader. His first impression was that he had gained a decisive victory.\r\nIn the evening he wrote to his mother:\r\n\r\n    “My brothers and I are well. The Austrians are in danger of\r\n    losing the whole campaign and I find myself free with 150,000\r\n    men, and that we are masters of a kingdom which must provide\r\n    us with troops and money. The Austrians are scattered like\r\n    chaff before the wind. I am going to send part of my troops to\r\n    compliment _Messieurs les Français_ and to pursue the Austrians\r\n    with the rest.”\r\n\r\nHe informed Wilhelmina that about 5000 men had been killed and wounded.\r\nTo his ally, George II., he sent word that the battle had been “as\r\ndecisive as possible,” and to his Scotch friend, Field-Marshal Keith,\r\nthat he believed that the capture of Prague would finish the war.\r\nFuller knowledge showed that these ideas were ill-conceived. The King’s\r\nimpatience had caused an attack across treacherous ground with weary\r\nmen. The pursuit therefore failed, and the Austrian casualties did\r\nnot greatly exceed the Prussian. Frederick himself later computed his\r\nloss at 18,000 men, “without counting Marshal Schwerin, who alone was\r\nworth above 10,000.” The most moderate estimate states it at 12,500.\r\nThe Austrians lost some 13,000, including prisoners, but nearly 11,000\r\nmore fled across the Sazawa, and the Prussians made an unwonted haul\r\nof baggage and artillery. One of the musketeers wrote home that 186,000\r\nPrussians had beaten 295,000 Austrians and captured 200 guns. The army\r\nand the people were jubilant, but the price was great. “Schwerin’s\r\ndeath,” said the King, long after, “withered the laurels of victory,\r\nwhich was bought with too much precious blood. On this day fell the\r\npillars of the Prussian infantry ... and a bloody and terrible war gave\r\nno time to rear them anew.”\r\n\r\nThe success of the campaign now hung on the fate of Prague. If the\r\ncapital and its defenders fell into his hands without delay, the King\r\nmight still execute the remainder of his daring scheme. He might sweep\r\naway Daun, enter Moravia, and dictate peace at Vienna. Thence he might\r\nlead his army to the western scene of war, to crush the forces of the\r\nEmpire, and drive the French across the Rhine. A strong reinforcement,\r\nhe believed, would enable Lehwaldt to grapple with the Russians, whose\r\nsoldierly qualities he had not yet learned to appreciate. The moral\r\neffect of his victory was felt by all Europe. Frederick became the hero\r\nof the English nation. At Vienna depression reigned, and Kaunitz grew\r\nloud in his appeals to France and Russia. Roving bands of Prussians\r\nspread terror through the Empire by pretending to be the vanguard of\r\nthe King, and demanding contributions from the magistrates of hostile\r\ntowns with threats of stern measures if their demands were not complied\r\nwith. Austria could not protect her German allies, and Louis XV. feared\r\nthat she might now desert him as Prussia had deserted him in 1742 and\r\n1745. If Prague fell the coalition would be shaken if not destroyed.\r\n\r\nBut however great the profit to be gained by the fall of Prague,\r\nFrederick realised that he could not hope to carry by storm a city\r\nwhich Browne had previously undertaken to hold with 8000 men and which\r\nnow contained a garrison of 44,000. He therefore detached the Duke of\r\nBevern with a force of 17,500 to observe Daun in the south, while he\r\nhimself set to work to reduce Prague by starvation. In the hope of\r\ndestroying the magazines he maintained a severe bombardment, which\r\nput the inhabitants to great suffering but brought little military\r\nadvantage. He even brought a notorious burglar out of gaol to break\r\ninto the city and procure information. Prince Charles, who had plenty\r\nof meal though little meat, did not risk his army in a sally _en\r\nmasse_, but with the approval of his Government simply waited for Daun\r\nto set him free. This was an afflicting policy for the impatient King.\r\nOn May 24th, Frederick hoped “at present more than ever that all this\r\nrace of Austrian princes and beggars will be obliged to lay down their\r\narms.” On May 29th, he informed Wilhelmina that a week ought to see the\r\nend, but before the week was over he began to admit the possibility of\r\nfailure. On June 11th he wrote to Lehwaldt that it might be three or\r\nfour weeks before he would be free to move. Next day, after hearing\r\nfrom Bevern that Daun could no longer be kept at bay, he sounded the\r\nknell of the whole enterprise:\r\n\r\n    “Who loses time in war,” runs Frederick’s broken German,\r\n    “cannot make it good again. Had you pressed forward at once\r\n    towards Czaslau, Daun would have retreated further ... and I\r\n    wager that if one flies at his throat he will do it. To get\r\n    together 10 battalions now is impossible, but perhaps I will\r\n    come myself to make an end of the matter, so that what has been\r\n    gained by bravery be not lost by hesitation.... Daun must be\r\n    driven into Moravia be he weak or strong, else we do not win\r\n    Prague and cannot resist the other enemies who come on, and the\r\n    whole campaign, however well begun, is lost.”\r\n\r\nThe cause of this note to Bevern was that with less than 10,000 men he\r\nhad at last fallen back before the enemy. Daun, whose caution was to\r\nearn him the nickname “_Fabius Cunctator_,” had assembled an army some\r\n54,000 strong and was advancing under strict orders to venture a battle\r\nfor the relief of Prague. Frederick felt that the crisis called for his\r\nown presence. For the issue he had no fear. In order to risk nothing\r\nduring his absence, he took with him only some 14,000 men, so that by\r\nstrict count of heads he would attack against odds of more than five to\r\nthree. But if Schwerin were worth 10,000 men, the King may well have\r\nbelieved that his own value was far greater. On June 16th he wrote to\r\nhis representative in London that he had joined Bevern,\r\n\r\n    “in order to march straight on Field-Marshal Daun, to fight\r\n    him, and to drive him altogether out of Bohemia into Moravia. I\r\n    flatter myself that in a few days I shall be able to give you\r\n    good news of our success; and when this expedition is happily\r\n    over, I believe that the town of Prague will fall of its own\r\n    accord, and that then with hands more free, I shall be able to\r\n    send a detachment against the French.”\r\n\r\nThe King’s confidence was in great part warranted by what he had\r\nalready seen in the present war. It seemed that only a Browne would\r\ndare to attack Prussian troops led by their King. Had not Prince\r\nCharles been overruled by his generals, he would have abandoned Prague\r\nto avoid a battle. Daun had retreated before Bevern till he became\r\noverwhelmingly superior in force, and he advanced only when his Queen\r\npromised him gratitude for a victory and her continued favour if he\r\nwere beaten. The most that could be expected from such commanders as\r\nthese was that they would stand on the defensive in a strong position.\r\n\r\nThis very fact made the tactics of the Prussians doubly formidable.\r\nDrilled to the last degree of perfection, they could change their\r\nformation with a speed which their enemies admired but could not rival.\r\nFrederick could therefore veil his movement till the last moment.\r\nHaving chosen the enemy’s most vulnerable wing, he could strengthen the\r\nwing opposed to it without fear that the enemy would either accomplish\r\nthe countermove in time or attack the section which he had weakened.\r\nIt was therefore of little consequence that the Austrians greatly\r\noutnumbered the Prussians in the part of the field where no fighting\r\nwas likely to take place. The battle was gained because the Prussians\r\nswiftly overcame all that nature and art could oppose to them at the\r\nspot selected by the King for contact. The doomed wing would be broken,\r\nthe centre laid bare, and then the cautious Austrian would make off,\r\nrejoicing that it was not dishonourable to be beaten by the King of\r\nPrussia, and that the attack demanded so much preliminary marching that\r\nthe weary victors were not often terrible in pursuit.\r\n\r\nSuch were the tactics attempted in the battle of June 18, 1757, when\r\nFrederick attacked Daun in his camp overlooking the highroad between\r\nVienna and Prague, within sight of the town of Kolin. The country\r\nundulates sufficiently to make it impossible for the King to have\r\nascertained every detail of the problem with which he was confronted.\r\nBut from many points, and with especial clearness from an isolated\r\nheight across the highway, he could see that the Austrian right wing\r\nheld the crest of a gentle slope south of the road and parallel with\r\nit, and that it was at the further extremity of this wing that the\r\nground seemed most favourable to the attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF KOLIN, JUNE 18, 1757.]\r\n\r\nThe morning of the stifling summer’s day was spent in marching along\r\nthe line of the highroad towards Kolin, and it was after midday that\r\nthe Prussian left turned upon the enemy. Zieten, the terrible hussar,\r\nput to flight the Austrian horse, but an oak-wood gave them shelter\r\nbehind which to rally, and meanwhile Daun made all haste to move up\r\nsupports to his right. But though the Austrians fought doggedly and\r\npoured in a deadly artillery fire, the matchless Prussian infantry\r\npressed on. They captured point after point of Daun’s position until\r\nthe moment came at which, although their cavalry had turned tail, they\r\nneeded only reinforcements to crush his right. It was the duty of\r\nPrince Maurice, the son of the Old Dessauer, to bring help from the\r\ncentre. The moment was critical. The Austrian musketeers, seven times\r\ncharged by the Prussians, had shot away their last cartridge. “Four\r\nfresh battalions,” wrote the King four days after, “and the battle was\r\nwon.” Daun had already begun to withdraw his heavy guns and to issue\r\norders for retreat. But by a fatal misunderstanding, due, it is hinted,\r\nto the impatience of the King in giving orders, Maurice was attacking\r\nthe enemy more than half a mile further down the line. Still nearer to\r\nthe Prussian right General Manstein defied orders and dashed at the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians were therefore involved in a frontal attack, and their\r\ninferiority in numbers at once began to tell against them. Yet still,\r\nthough Frederick had only the reserves of cavalry in hand and these,\r\neven when he put himself at their head, refused to pass through\r\nthe fire to aid them, the dauntless Prussian left achieved fresh\r\ntriumphs. When the deadly wrestle reached its fourth hour they still\r\nmaintained their hold upon the heights. Daun hurled his light Saxon\r\ncavalry upon them, but with a heroism worthy of Mollwitz field they\r\nformed into groups and drove back the foe. But at this moment the\r\nCount de Thiennes, colonel of a regiment of young dragoons from the\r\nNetherlands, begged for leave to attack. He won a grudging assent,\r\nat first refused, “but,” said Daun, “you won’t do much good with your\r\nbeardless boys.” “You will see,” answered Thiennes and galloped back\r\nto his regiment. “Boys,” he cried, after repeating the field-marshal’s\r\ntaunt, “show that though you are beardless you can bite.” Uniting with\r\nthe Saxons, the “boys” swept the enemy’s horse from the field, then\r\nflung themselves on the grim square of tattered heroes, broke it, and\r\ndrove it from the heights. This was the prelude to a general flight of\r\nthe exhausted remnants of the Prussian infantry. Almost beside himself\r\nwith rage and disappointment, Frederick collected some forty men and\r\nled them against the foe. But even the King could not persuade them to\r\nsuicide. One by one they slunk away till at last his adjutant put the\r\nquestion, “Will your Majesty take the battery alone?” Frederick once\r\nmore gazed at the enemy through his glass, then rode to Bevern on the\r\nright and ordered retreat.\r\n\r\nOf 31,000 Prussians little more than 17,000 were left. As at Prague,\r\nit was the infantry whose loss was the greatest. Of 18,000, more than\r\ntwo-thirds were killed or captured. It was true that they had inflicted\r\nupon the enemy a loss of more than 8000 men, and that Daun, “like a\r\ngood Christian who would not suffer the sun to go down on his wrath,”\r\ndid nothing by way of pursuit. But Frederick saw at a glance that the\r\nconquest of Bohemia was now beyond his strength. On June 20, 1757,\r\nthe very day on which Prince Charles had announced that he would be\r\ncompelled to surrender, the besiegers quitted Prague.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s plan was to retreat slowly through north-eastern Bohemia\r\ninto Saxony, exhausting the country as he went. “My heart is torn in\r\npieces,” he wrote to Prince Maurice two days after the battle, “but I\r\nam not cast down and will try on the first opportunity to wipe out this\r\ndisgrace.” Perhaps because, in his own phrase, “a certain Hungarian\r\nrabble has taken kennel on the highways,” his letter to his sister\r\nmakes light of Kolin. “I attacked Daun on the 18th. In spite of all\r\nour efforts, we found the country so difficult that I believed myself\r\nbound to abandon the enterprise in order not to lose my army.” For the\r\ninformation of Berlin, Eichel magnified the gentle slopes which are\r\nall that the battle-field can show into “a steep mountain, cut by many\r\nravines and defiles at its base.” But to London the King sent a franker\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n    “After winning eight battles in succession, we have for the\r\n    first time been beaten, and that because the enemy had three\r\n    posts on a tolerably high hill fortified by strong batteries\r\n    one behind another. After taking two of them, the attacking\r\n    battalions and their supports had suffered so much that they\r\n    were too few to force the third post, and so the battle ended\r\n    for lack of combatants.”\r\n\r\nThe transports of the Queen and the exaggerated caution with which Daun\r\nand Prince Charles neglected to follow up their advantage attested\r\nthe truth of Frederick’s assurance that his situation was by no means\r\ndesperate.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day however, it altered for the worse. Disaster in the\r\nfield was followed by affliction in the home. Within a fortnight\r\nof Kolin, Frederick suddenly learned that his mother was no more.\r\nThe crushing news was blurted out by a letter from his wife, whose\r\nthoughtless use of a red seal in place of a black one frustrated the\r\nkindly machinery which Podewils and Eichel had devised for preparing\r\nthe mind of the King. He had just written to Wilhelmina a letter full\r\nof confidence.\r\n\r\n    “You have nothing to fear on my account, dear sister, men are\r\n    always in the hands of what is called destiny.... Germany is\r\n    passing through a terrible crisis. I am obliged to stand alone\r\n    in defending her liberties and her faith. If I fall, there will\r\n    be an end of them. But I have good hope. However great may be\r\n    the number of my enemies, I trust in the goodness of my cause,\r\n    in the admirable courage of my troops and in the goodwill which\r\n    exists from the marshals down to the humblest soldier.”\r\n\r\nThen the blow fell and for two days, even at such a crisis, the flow of\r\npolitical correspondence is checked. His grief finds utterance in an\r\nagonised note to his sister Amelia.\r\n\r\n    “All kinds of misfortune are overwhelming me at once.... I am\r\n    more dead than alive.... Perhaps Heaven has taken away our dear\r\n    Mother that she may not see the misfortunes of our House.”\r\n    “Yesterday and the day before,” writes Eichel on July 3d, “His\r\n    Majesty’s grief has been very great and violent, but today\r\n    it is somewhat lessened, because his Majesty has taken into\r\n    consideration his duty to his state, his army and his faithful\r\n    subjects at the present crisis, and the necessary orders have\r\n    somewhat relieved his depression, though there is no lack of\r\n    gloomy moments and intervals.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day the King began to pour out his soul to Mitchell, who\r\nowns himself “most sensibly affected to see him indulging his grief and\r\ngiving way to the warmest filial affections.”\r\n\r\nCalamity was, however, as impotent as success to teach Frederick good\r\nfaith towards his allies. Mitchell had reported on June 30, 1757, that\r\n“he renewed to me on this occasion his firm resolution to hearken to no\r\nterms of peace without His Majesty’s privity and approbation.” On July\r\n9th he describes a further interview in which “His Prussian Majesty\r\nsaid that, as he resolved to continue firmly united with His Majesty,\r\nit would be for their mutual interests to think of terms of peace,\r\nhonourable and safe for both, and to concert together what terms they\r\nwould adopt, if a favourable opportunity occurred to propose them.”\r\nYet between these assurances of fidelity to England Frederick accepted\r\nwith enthusiasm an offer made by Wilhelmina to send an envoy to procure\r\npeace with France by bribing the Pompadour.\r\n\r\n    “I will willingly charge myself with his expenses,” he writes\r\n    on July 7th. “He may offer the favourite anything up to 500,000\r\n    crowns for peace, and he may raise his offers far higher if at\r\n    the same time they would promise to procure us some advantages.\r\n    You see all the nicety of which I have need in this affair and\r\n    how little I must be seen in it. If England should have the\r\n    least wind of it all would be lost.”\r\n\r\nJob’s tidings continued to pour in upon the King. In the sunshine of\r\nKolin the crop sown by Kaunitz was ripening fast. Before July was half\r\nover Frederick learned that the French had seized East Frisia and were\r\nstriking east, that the Swedes were sending 17,000 men into Pomerania,\r\nand that the Russians were likely to destroy Lehwaldt in Ost-Preussen.\r\nThus all his northern frontier was on fire and the army of the Empire\r\nwas about to join the Austrians in kindling new conflagrations in the\r\nsouth. Bohemia, of course, must soon be abandoned, and how would it be\r\npossible to hold Saxony, Silesia, or even Brandenburg against such a\r\nhost of foes? Men said that in Voltaire the King of Prussia had lost\r\nhis pen and in Schwerin his sword.\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of the month the situation altered still further\r\nfor the worse. While Frederick lay motionless at Leitmeritz on the\r\nElbe, intent on devouring Bohemia till the last moment, but keeping\r\nopen his retreat into Saxony, his eldest brother, Augustus William,\r\nwas out-manœuvred by the Austrians further east. Prince Charles, with\r\ninferior numbers, seized one of his posts, outpaced him to Zittau,\r\nburnt the magazine there, and finally compelled him to flee far into\r\nSaxony. Nothing remained but for the indignant King to rescue the heir\r\nto the throne, who had thus opened to the enemy the Lusatian door into\r\nboth Saxony and Silesia. On his way Frederick paused to garrison\r\nPirna, and there, on July 27, 1757, he received what Mitchell terms “a\r\ndraught of comfort to one who has not had a single drop since the 18th\r\nJune.”\r\n\r\nSo serious was the crisis that the King had sent orders to Berlin that\r\nat the first news of further disaster in Lusatia the archives and\r\ntreasure should be removed to Cüstrin. That very day he had written\r\na plain account of the situation to convince his ally of England how\r\ndesperate was his plight. “If I except Spain, Denmark, Holland, and the\r\nKing of Sardinia, I have all Europe against me. Even so, I fear not for\r\nthe places where I can set armies against them, but for those where he\r\nwho comes will find no one to oppose him.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the King’s mood when his friend, the ambassador of England,\r\nlaid before him with delight the contents of as considerate a despatch\r\nas was ever penned in Whitehall. Sympathy for Kolin, approval of the\r\nnew plan of campaign, “entire reliance upon the King of Prussia’s great\r\nmilitary abilities,” a cheerful review of the forces still at his\r\ndisposal—all this might be expected from the ministers of George II.\r\nBut what followed might well have heaped coals of fire upon Frederick’s\r\nhead. His ally, little suspecting the overtures to the Pompadour,\r\npersisted in treating him as a man of honour.\r\n\r\n    “The hint his Prussian Majesty threw out to you, of an\r\n    inclination to peace, is agreeable to the language that Prince\r\n    has held from the very beginning of the present troubles in\r\n    Germany.... The King will at all times be glad to contribute\r\n    to a general pacification, whenever equitable conditions can\r\n    be had for himself, the King of Prussia, and their allies ...\r\n    the King being determined to take no steps in an affair of this\r\n    consequence without his Prussian Majesty’s concurrence and\r\n    approbation.”\r\n\r\nThen follow solid offers of co-operation with ships and above all with\r\ngold, the latter “only meant as the convenient and proper contingent of\r\nEngland to her allies.”\r\n\r\nFrederick, by Mitchell’s account, received the message\r\n\r\n    “with a flow of gratitude not to be described. After a short\r\n    pause, he said, ‘I am deeply sensible of the King’s and your\r\n    nation’s generosity, but I do not wish to be a burden to my\r\n    allies; I would have you delay answering this letter till\r\n    affairs are ended in Lusatia; if I succeed, I will then consult\r\n    with you upon the different points suggested in the letter\r\n    and give my opinion freely upon them. If I am beat, there\r\n    will be no occasion to answer it at all; it will be out of\r\n    your power to save me, and I would not willingly abuse the\r\n    generosity of my allies by drawing them into unnecessary and\r\n    expensive engagements that can answer no valuable purpose.’ I\r\n    was pleased, but not surprised,” the report continues, “with\r\n    the noble dignity of this answer, for I have seen the King of\r\n    Prussia great in prosperity but greater still in adversity.”\r\n\r\nThere was, however, little of dignity or greatness in the King’s\r\ntreatment of his unlucky brother and heir, whom he met on the road\r\nto Bautzen two days later. It was in the early hours of the morning,\r\naccording to the narrative of an eye-witness, the son of one of the\r\nchief delinquents, that Augustus William saw the King and beside him\r\nWinterfeldt and Goltz, two of his own generals, for whom he had waited\r\na full hour in vain. Each of the royal brothers rode at the head of\r\nhis staff, and in Frederick’s train were Prince Henry and Ferdinand\r\nof Brunswick. At a distance of about three hundred paces the King\r\nstopped. Augustus William did the like, and he and his party doffed\r\nhats. The King’s party bowed to them, but Frederick turned his horse\r\nround, dismounted, and lay down upon the ground as though awaiting his\r\nvanguard. He made Winterfeldt and Goltz sit by him. All his officers\r\ndismounted, as did the Prince and his party. Soon Goltz crossed over\r\nto the Prince and said a few words to him, whereupon the Prince called\r\nhis officers together and requested him to repeat the King’s message in\r\ntheir presence. This he did in the following words:\r\n\r\n    “His Majesty bids me tell Your Royal Highness that he has\r\n    cause to be very dissatisfied with you. You deserve that a\r\n    court-martial should be held over you, and then you and all the\r\n    generals with you would lose your heads. But His Majesty is not\r\n    willing to carry the matter so far, because in the General he\r\n    would not forget the Brother.”\r\n\r\nAugustus William made answer like a brave man, exculpating his\r\ngenerals, and requesting a strict enquiry into his own conduct. But\r\nthe King replied only by putting himself at the head of his vanguard,\r\nwhich had now come up, and riding on with his staff past the Prince,\r\nalways keeping from three to four hundred paces away from him. At\r\nBautzen he encamped, but still kept at a distance from the fugitives,\r\nlest, suggests Eichel, their fear should contaminate his own officers.\r\nAugustus William, treated like a leper, applied for permission to go\r\nto Dresden. “The Prince may go where he will,” said Frederick to the\r\nlieutenant who bore the letter. He went to Berlin and died of a broken\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIf anything could palliate brutality to the merely unfortunate it would\r\nhave been the situation in which Frederick was placed by his brother’s\r\nblunder. Despite all his efforts, the Austrians remained masters of\r\nthe pass into Lusatia. With French, Swedes, Russians, and Imperialists\r\nall pressing on, it became imperative to dispose of the Austrians by\r\na second Hohenfriedberg. But Prince Charles was not to be tempted\r\nfrom the strong position which Daun had chosen with his wonted skill.\r\nAfter three impatient weeks Frederick decided that the peril from the\r\nFrench was too acute to permit of further delay in trying to force\r\nthe Austrians to give battle. Early in August he received the news of\r\nCumberland’s downfall at Hastenbeck. Hanover lay at the mercy of the\r\nFrench under Richelieu, and when on August 25, 1757, the King turned\r\nhis face towards the west, Soubise with a second French force and the\r\narmy of the Empire was already at Erfurt. Frederick was determined\r\nto maintain his hold on Saxony. Bevern, he decided, must watch the\r\nAustrians, distance and fortune must account for the Russians and\r\nSwedes, while he himself undertook a march of two hundred miles to\r\nmuster 20,000 men and lead them against Soubise.\r\n\r\nIt seemed at first as though the King did wrong to trust in fortune.\r\nOn August 30, 1757, the army of Ost-Preussen was vanquished by the\r\nRussians at Gross-Jägersdorf. Frederick, however, kept on his way. In\r\nthe middle of September he reached the scene of action, only to suffer\r\nfrom the caution of Soubise a month of the same torture that Prince\r\nCharles had inflicted in Lusatia. Then he was suddenly called upon to\r\nhurry a hundred miles towards the north-east to drive the Austrians\r\nfrom his capital. In his absence Prince Charles had moved eastwards\r\ninto Silesia and his rearguard of light cavalry, 15,000 strong, seized\r\na favourable moment for a foray on Berlin. They exacted a ransom of\r\n200,000 thalers from the town, and then made off by forced marches.\r\nFrederick, who feared an invasion in force, was greatly relieved at\r\nthe news, which reached him on October 18th. Next day, despairing of\r\nbringing the French to book, he informed Prince Maurice that it was\r\ntime to think of chasing the Austrians from Silesia, but on the 23rd he\r\nsent him word that Soubise was after all leaving the hills and marching\r\nstraight for Leipzig.\r\n\r\n“Here very much is altered in a day,” he added with his own hand. It\r\nwas in fact the turning-point of the most marvellous and chequered\r\nyear of Frederick’s life. Full of hope, he ordered a concentration\r\nbetween his own command and those of Ferdinand, Keith, and Maurice.\r\nThe sum-total was not great, but the quality and temper of the troops\r\nwere incomparable. They were face to face with Frenchmen, of old the\r\nscorners of the German race, which they were wont to conquer by their\r\narms and to corrupt by their example. Now these invaders were laden\r\nwith the spoils of Thuringia. Insolent and infatuated, they were too\r\nproud to see among themselves defects which were patent to Prussian\r\neyes. It was little wonder that Frederick’s veterans shared the\r\nardour of their King. “The spirit of the soldiers was remarkable,”\r\nnoted Mitchell when they came to Leipzig. “They did not complain of\r\nfatigue, notwithstanding of the long marches, but desired to be led out\r\nimmediately, and murmured on being ordered to quarters.”\r\n\r\nThree days later their desire was gratified. On the last day of\r\nOctober, 1757, Frederick was at Weissenfels on the Saale, checked for\r\nthe moment because the enemy burned the bridge in his face and held\r\nthe line of the river against him. His road from Leipzig had led him\r\nacross the dismal plain where Charles XII. held for a moment the fate\r\nof Europe in his hand, past the granite slab which marks the spot where\r\na greater King of Sweden fell at the head of his men. The region is\r\nmemorable in history, but the deed which would have been most notable\r\nof all was averted. At Weissenfels, tradition says, Frederick owed his\r\nlife to the chivalry of a French officer who forbade an artilleryman to\r\npick him off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK VIEWING THE BURNING BRIDGE AT WEISSENFELS.\r\n\r\nFROM A RELIEF ON HIS STATUE AT WEISSENFELS.]\r\n\r\nThe French and Imperialists gave up the line of the Saale, joined\r\nforces, and took up a strong position in the undulating country to the\r\nwest. On November 3rd, Frederick crossed the river and expected that\r\nnext day the intolerable tension would be at an end. When, however,\r\nhe came to reconnoitre the enemy’s position in force he found that to\r\nattack it against odds of two to one would be to invite a second Kolin.\r\nTo the exultation of the allies, he drew back under a heavy cannonade\r\nand encamped with his left wing resting on Rossbach. On November 5th,\r\nEichel, who was lodged at a safe distance, sent word of this fiasco to\r\nthe Government, which had taken refuge in Magdeburg. “The whole war,”\r\nwrote this most submissive of Frederick’s slaves, “is of no avail. May\r\nYour Excellency soon make a good peace.” He added a postscript: “At the\r\nmoment of closing this, about 2 o’clock in the afternoon, we hear a\r\nvery loud cannon-fire and, as it seems, musketry also.” Frederick was\r\nbeing delivered from his troubles by a game of hide-and-seek.\r\n\r\nThe King’s object in encamping near Rossbach was to turn the allies’\r\nposition, or, failing this, to hang upon their rear when hunger\r\nshould compel them to retreat. By the enemy, however, the movement\r\nwas attributed to fear. Hot-headed Frenchmen, full of the martial\r\ntraditions of their race, urged Soubise to crush a foe whose stroke\r\nthey had yet to learn lest his little army should escape them. Vengeful\r\nSaxon voices joined with theirs, while shivering Imperialists, who\r\nfor five days had subsisted on what food they could pick up among the\r\npeasants, clamoured for the break-up of the camp. Soubise at last gave\r\nway and planned a second Soor, to be done this time in broad daylight.\r\nScreened by the low hills, the allies were to march round Frederick’s\r\nleft and to take him in flank and rear. Believing themselves to be four\r\ntimes as strong as the King, they feared only lest he should flee to\r\nMerseburg in time.\r\n\r\nAfter a march of some three hours the allies reached a point due south\r\nof Rossbach. With a salutary access of caution, the French proposed to\r\nencamp there, right on Frederick’s flank. But this proposal was angrily\r\nresisted by the Imperialists and Saxons, and at the critical moment\r\nthe news came that the Prussians were retreating. It was evident that\r\nthey could delay no longer without permitting Frederick to escape. If,\r\nhowever, they hastened round the eastern end of the long, low ridge\r\nwhich hid his army from view, they might still take it in flank as it\r\nfled along the road to Merseburg. With this plan in mind, Soubise and\r\nhis colleagues cast prudence to the winds. From the first they had\r\nomitted to name a place of retreat or a formation to be adopted in case\r\nthey should be attacked. Now their army hurried along pell-mell, with\r\nthree generals at the head of the cavalry, the infantry straggling\r\nafter as best they might, the French reserves pressing between the\r\nmarching columns and the artillery, and the whole flank exposed on the\r\nleft, where the low ridge still screened the enemy from their sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF ROSSBACH, NOVEMBER 5, 1757.]\r\n\r\nBehind that ridge Frederick was ranking his men for battle. He, too,\r\nhad believed his opponents to be in retreat and received with coarse\r\ntaunts and disbelief the report of a lieutenant that they were trying\r\nto outflank him. The sight of their infantry, however, convinced\r\nhim that they meant even more than a reconnoissance. At a glance he\r\nsaw his opportunity. “In less than two minutes,” writes an onlooker,\r\n“all the tents lay on the ground, as though someone had pulled a\r\nstring behind the scenes, and the army was in full march.” At first,\r\nby great luck, the heads of the Prussian columns pointed north-east\r\ntowards Merseburg, and thus the allies were deluded into the belief\r\nthat they were in retreat. Then, hidden by the ridge, they moved east\r\nand finally south-east, converging towards the enemy. In the waning\r\nNovember afternoon they formed line and waited unseen, cannon massed on\r\nthe right, Prince Henry with the infantry in the centre, on the extreme\r\nleft Seydlitz, the prince of dragoons, smoking his short clay pipe till\r\nthe King should order the charge.\r\n\r\nLittle more than an hour after the Prussians struck their tents they\r\nwere dashing at the open flank of the allies, and ere another hour had\r\npassed Frederick’s western frontier was saved. The so-called battle of\r\nRossbach would be better named the drove of Reichartswerben. But for\r\nthe slaughter inevitable when the best troops in the world swooped down\r\nupon a mob, the encounter would have been a pure farce. First Seydlitz\r\nby repeated charges drove the cavalry of the allies off the field.\r\nThen, to the accompaniment of a heavy cannonade, Prince Henry led the\r\ninfantry down the slope and poured swift volleys into the medley out of\r\nwhich Soubise was vainly struggling to form a line of battle. Some of\r\nthe French, Swiss, and West-German troops showed fight, the rest fled.\r\nFinally Seydlitz fell upon their rear and the butchery was checked only\r\nby darkness. At the cost of about five hundred men Frederick destroyed\r\nan army of nearly fifty thousand and made himself the hero of the\r\nTeutonic race. He jeered at the vanquished enemy in blasphemous French\r\nverses and set to work to reap the fruits of victory.\r\n\r\nEverywhere save in Silesia the aspect of affairs was changing in his\r\nfavour. A report that Elizabeth was dying caused the Russians to\r\nwithdraw from Ost-Preussen just when their victory had placed it at\r\ntheir mercy. Lehwaldt was therefore set free to undertake the defence\r\nof Pomerania against the Swedes. England, inspired by Pitt, was proving\r\nherself a worthy ally against France. A new army was formed for the\r\ndefence of Hanover. The command was offered to Prince Ferdinand, and\r\nBritish soldiers were to serve under him. For the present year at\r\nleast, the North and West might be accounted safe. But from the Eastern\r\ntheatre of war the news was bad. Prince Charles had followed Bevern\r\ninto Silesia and now stood between him and Schweidnitz. Not a moment\r\nwas to be lost if the King would save this important fortress.\r\n\r\nOnce more, however, Prussian speed was equal to all demands. Two days\r\nafter Rossbach Frederick was already on his way. “I will leave you\r\nas strong a corps as I can on this side,” he writes to Keith, “and\r\nmarch unceasingly for Silesia. A toilsome year for me!” In good heart\r\nafter Rossbach, he strongly approved of Bevern’s resolve to attack\r\nthe Austrians. “For God’s sake have no fear of a weak enemy,” he\r\nwrote, “but trust to your own insight and experience.” But the days of\r\nSchwerin and the Old Dessauer were over. Except Henry and Ferdinand,\r\nFrederick had now no general from whom he could expect victories like\r\nhis own. While he strode swiftly through Saxony Silesia was lost. On\r\nNovember 18, 1757, at Königsbrück, he learned that Schweidnitz had\r\nfallen without a blow. The confused reproaches and threats which he\r\npoured out upon Bevern and his generals were futile, for on the 22nd\r\nPrince Charles drove the Prussians from Breslau across the Oder, and\r\nwithin the week the capital was Austrian once more.\r\n\r\nBefore the news of Breslau reached him Frederick had declared to Bevern\r\nthat he was firmly resolved to attack the enemy, but that it must be\r\nwith their united forces, “else I am too weak and not much over 12,000\r\nstrong.” Next day, November 24th, at Naumburg on the Queiss the report\r\nreached him that Bevern had gained a victory. He therefore planned to\r\ncatch Prince Charles in a net at Neumarkt by marching from Liegnitz\r\nto meet Bevern sallying forth from Breslau. He even hinted that Keith\r\nmight surprise Prague, and wrote to Ferdinand: “With good fortune I\r\nflatter myself that I shall finish this business in a fortnight.” “The\r\nAlmighty shows us one great mercy after another,” wrote Eichel. Next\r\nday they learned part of the truth, though rumour multiplied fourfold\r\nthe Austrian loss of 6000. “Defend Breslau to the last man—on peril of\r\nyour head,” was the sum of Frederick’s orders to his brother-in-law,\r\naccompanied by much military counsel and a promise of speedy aid. But\r\nsoon the news came that Bevern was a prisoner, that his army had fled\r\nto Glogau, worst of all, that Breslau had capitulated without firing\r\na shot. Thousands of the garrison voluntered to serve Maria Theresa.\r\nIt is said that one battalion quitted the capital in a strength of\r\nnine officers and four men. After sixteen years Silesia seemed to be\r\nwelcoming home its Queen.\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight Frederick’s army had struggled along bad roads at\r\nthe astonishing rate of nearly sixteen miles a day. They drew rein\r\nat Parchwitz, within two marches of Breslau. There on November 28th\r\nthe King composed a short testament. “I will be buried at Sans Souci\r\nwithout pomp or ceremony—and by night,” was his decree. “... If the\r\nbattle be won, my brother must none the less send a messenger to France\r\nwith full powers to negotiate for peace.” The words show how completely\r\nhe identified himself with Prussia amid circumstances so gloomy that\r\nEichel forbore, ever after, to mention the document lest he should\r\nrecall them to the mind of the King. Yet on the same day Frederick\r\nwrote one of his most characteristic letters to Wilhelmina, who had\r\nexpressed her fear that the army vanquished at Rossbach would afflict\r\nGermany anew. “This is now our task,” ran his reply:\r\n\r\n    “to put the Austrians to flight and to recover all that we have\r\n    lost; and it is no trifle. However, I am undertaking it at the\r\n    risk of what may follow. Neither Soubise nor the Imperialists\r\n    will come back this year: as for the future, we must hope for\r\n    peace, for indeed it seems as though our enemies had determined\r\n    to destroy the human race.... I beg you to await the issue in\r\n    these parts with patience; neither our anxiety nor our care\r\n    make any difference to it, and nothing will happen except\r\n    what pleases His Sacred Majesty Chance.... If I reach winter\r\n    quarters, I shall have the honour of sending you a prodigious\r\n    quantity of verse of every kind.”\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Frederick’s fatalism did not abate his energy, nor\r\nagainst such odds did his courage degenerate into rashness. He gave\r\nthe command of Bevern’s ruined army to Zieten, who had defeated the\r\nenemy’s right in the battle of Breslau, and bade him bring men and guns\r\nfrom Glogau. Then he and his weary 14,000 waited four full days at\r\nParchwitz, with Prince Charles’s victorious army to their front, the\r\ngarrison of Liegnitz on their flank, and Austrian slowness letting slip\r\nthe opportunity to attack.\r\n\r\nOn December 2nd, Zieten arrived at Parchwitz, having rallied some\r\n18,000 men. Frederick had now an army about 32,000 strong, well\r\nfurnished with cavalry and artillery. His plan had from the first been\r\nas clear as the task before him. He was resolved to perish rather than\r\nabandon Silesia. The Austrians held the province by means of an army\r\nand two strong places, Breslau and Schweidnitz. He must therefore\r\nfirst beat the army and then capture the strong places. The advent of\r\nDecember forbade long manœuvring in the hope of catching Prince Charles\r\nat a disadvantage. To save Silesia this year and Prussia next, he must\r\nlead his army straight to the enemy. The problem that he expected to\r\nfind resembled the problem of Prague and of Kolin—to destroy an army\r\nnot inferior in numbers posted in ground of its own choosing. Prince\r\nCharles, he believed, had his back to Breslau and his front protected\r\nby a stream of some size. “He is in an advantageous camp,” wrote Eichel\r\non December 1st, “well furnished with artillery; he lives on our\r\nmagazines, and the possession of Breslau gives him liberty to retire in\r\nany case across the Oder, from which God preserve us!” The ejaculation\r\nreminds us that if the Austrian force remained in being, Frederick\r\nwould be foiled.\r\n\r\nThe King was determined to venture all upon a battle. That he\r\nappreciated the odds against him is not entirely clear. Writing to his\r\nbrother Henry on November 30th, he declares himself hopeful of pitting\r\n36,000 men against the 39,000 at which he estimates the Austrian force.\r\nNext day he alters the former number to 39,000, and Eichel states that\r\n\r\n    “According to many letters from his officers which we have\r\n    intercepted, the enemy has lost more than 24,000 men, as well\r\n    as 8000 at the siege of Schweidnitz; he has suffered much from\r\n    sickness; half of his cavalry is ruined; yet notwithstanding\r\n    all this he must be equal if not superior in numbers to\r\n    ourselves.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Prussian tradition represents the King as declaring\r\non December 3rd that, contrary to all the rules of war, he would attack\r\nPrince Charles’s army wherever he found it, though it was nearly\r\nthrice as strong as his own. But whatever be the truth,—whether or\r\nno he would have done what he had declined to do on the day before\r\nRossbach, whether or no he knew or guessed the truth that Prince\r\nCharles had 80,000 men,—Frederick spared no effort to fill every\r\nsoldier with his own spirit. Rest and food and drink, the story of\r\nRossbach to chase away the memory of Breslau, all these were showered\r\nupon an army which since adversity had purged it of its foreign\r\nelements responded with eager loyalty to the touch of the Prussian King.\r\n\r\nStripping off his cherished French manners, he was for a brief space\r\nthe Father of his people. The news flew round the army that the King\r\nhad bandied rough pleasantries with his grenadiers, that veterans had\r\ncalled him “Thou” and “Fritz,” that he had told the Pomeranians that\r\nwithout them he would not dare to give battle. The effect was magical,\r\nand the rank and file caught the glow which warmed the breasts of their\r\nsuperiors. For Frederick had done what he had perhaps never yet deigned\r\nto do, save when he quitted his capital in 1740 to grasp Silesia. He\r\nhad called his officers together and appealed in impassioned phrases\r\nto their honour, their loyalty, and their patriotism. “Gentlemen,” he\r\ncried, “the enemy stand in their entrenchments armed to the teeth.\r\nWe must attack them there, and conquer, or remain every one of us\r\non the field. If any of you is unwilling, he may have his discharge\r\nat once and go home.” Then he paused. The devoted men were silent,\r\nmany in tears, only one major cried out: “High time for such wretched\r\nscoundrels to be off.” Frederick smiled and declared that he was sure\r\nof their faithful service and of victory. He then denounced stern\r\nthreats against the man or regiment who should fail in the hour of\r\nbattle. “Farewell, gentlemen,” were his concluding words; “soon we beat\r\nthe enemy or we see one another no more.” More than twenty years later\r\nthe rough soldiers wept like children as they told the tale, and those\r\nwho heard it could not keep back their tears.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, December 4, 1757, King and army set out for Breslau. From\r\nParchwitz to the walls of the city the distance is some thirty-two\r\nmiles as the crow flies. The road runs through Neumarkt, about\r\ntwenty-three miles from Breslau, and Lissa, a little more than\r\nnine. That evening Neumarkt was in Prussian hands, and besides the\r\nlittle town 80,000 Austrian rations of bread, welcome in themselves,\r\nbut far more welcome for the news which they conveyed. “The fox,”\r\ncried Frederick, “has crept out of his hole, now I will punish his\r\npresumption.”\r\n\r\nOn December 2nd, the day of Zieten’s junction with the King, the\r\nAustrians had indeed determined to attack. The reason for this fatal\r\ndecision was by no means over-confidence born of success. Prince\r\nCharles was very far from despising the adversary who had defeated him\r\non four stricken fields. With almost nervous anxiety, in spite of his\r\n80,000 men, he sought to be informed of every movement in Frederick’s\r\ncamp at Parchwitz. It is true that Austrian policy would be best served\r\nif the Queen were to regain Silesia without the armies of her allies.\r\nIt is false that she ordered the army of Silesia to give battle at\r\nany cost. Before and after the fight Prince Charles stated expressly\r\nthat his generals were unanimous in favour of marching on Neumarkt.\r\nThe object was to save Liegnitz from Frederick and to prevent him from\r\nmaking his position too strong.\r\n\r\nBoth combatants, therefore, made for Neumarkt on the same day, and the\r\nforward movement of the Austrians was only quickened when they learned\r\nthat the Prussians had chased their vanguard from the town. On the\r\nnight of December 4th the armies lay within a few miles of each other.\r\nThe Prussians were exulting in the news that Prince Charles had crossed\r\nthe two streams which rendered his old position so formidable that\r\nFrederick had enrolled 800 volunteers for the first attack.\r\n\r\nWith an army tuned to the highest pitch and a King who knew every\r\nrood of the ground on the road to Breslau, the Prussians advanced to\r\ngive battle. Before five o’clock on the dismal morning of December 5,\r\n1757, they were on the march, Frederick in the van, and only a single\r\nbattalion left in Neumarkt with the baggage. The exact position of the\r\nAustrians was not known to them as they hastened through the broken\r\ncountry east of Neumarkt towards the champaign west of Leuthen. If the\r\nenemy had placed this champaign at their back, the attack would still\r\nbe hampered by the ground.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians had espied watch-fires on a height to the south of the\r\ngreat road a few miles east of Neumarkt—a height from which in daylight\r\nboth the towers of Neumarkt and the farms and cottages of Leuthen may\r\nbe seen. Was this an Austrian wing? To their delight it proved to be\r\nonly a vanguard. Three regiments of Saxon light horse, heroes of Kolin,\r\nhad been placed there with two of Imperial hussars to collect the wreck\r\nof the Neumarkt garrison and to watch the road to Breslau. They clung\r\ntoo closely to their task and were crushed by the Prussian vanguard.\r\nEleven officers and 540 men were taken prisoner, many fell, and the\r\nrest fled wildly to alarm the Austrian right. Frederick could with\r\ndifficulty check the mad pursuit of his hussars, who drew bridle almost\r\nwithin cannon-shot of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe King’s spirits rose yet higher when he learned from the prisoners\r\nthat Prince Charles had left most of his heavy guns in Breslau. He\r\nindulged his advancing columns with the sight of the captured troopers\r\nfiling past them to Neumarkt and again condescended to repartee. “Why\r\ndid you forsake me?” he asked a Frenchman who had previously deserted\r\nfrom the Prussian army. “Indeed, your Majesty,” the man replied, “our\r\nposition is too hopeless.” “Well,” said the King, “let us strike one\r\nmore blow to-day, and if I am beaten we will both desert to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF LEUTHEN, DECEMBER 5, 1757.]\r\n\r\nAs the gathering daylight revealed Prince Charles’s army Frederick’s\r\nconfidence was more than ever justified. The Austrian position, chosen\r\nperhaps to cover three routes to Breslau, was far too extensive. Their\r\nline, which stretched from Nippern due south across the highroad, then\r\non behind Leuthen village as far as Sagschütz and the pine-clad hill\r\nbeyond, was not less than five miles long and unprotected for the\r\nmost part by the ground. Only the right wing, where the Italian Luchesi\r\nwas in command, was defended in front and flank by hills and woods and\r\nmarshes. These made it practically impossible for the Prussians to\r\nattack at any point between Nippern and the highroad, and if they fell\r\nupon the centre Luchesi might advance through the wood and take them in\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nPrince Charles, who knew something of Frederick’s methods, would have\r\ndone well to strengthen his left. But on the day of Leuthen, Fortune\r\nseemed resolved to favour the side which trusted most to her help. By\r\ndesign or by accident, Frederick’s movements were such as to convince\r\nLuchesi that the Prussians were about to hurl all their strength upon\r\nhim. While the King reconnoitred, the heads of his columns remained\r\npointing in the direction of their line of march and thus seemed to\r\nthreaten the Austrian right. In each of the great battles of this year,\r\nat Prague, at Kolin, and in a sense also at Rossbach, it was the right\r\nwing of the allies upon which the Prussians fell. Now when he saw\r\nFrederick diligently inspecting his own quarter of the field Luchesi\r\ninsisted on being reinforced. His clamour prevailed and, at the moment\r\nwhen Frederick began the movement towards Leuthen and Sagschütz, Daun\r\nwas galloping with cavalry from the centre and left towards Nippern,\r\nthe point most distant from the danger.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian army this day surpassed itself in the swift precision of\r\nits movements. No sooner was the King’s plan formed than Maurice and\r\nZieten were ranking the eager veterans for their mysterious march due\r\nsouth—parallel with the Austrian line of battle and in part hidden from\r\nits view by the undulations of the ground. Frederick rode along the\r\nridge between the armies and exulted as he marked the mistake of Daun.\r\nFor some two miles he might, for all the Austrians knew, be in retreat.\r\nThen as the ground sinks into a plain he drew nearer to the enemy’s\r\nleft and hurled all his strength upon it.\r\n\r\nFrederick and his 32,000 men had only some four hours of daylight in\r\nwhich to overthrow a host nearly 80,000 strong. Despite the tension the\r\nPrussian machine worked perfectly. The complicated attack in oblique\r\norder was accomplished as never before or after, and an invincible\r\nassault began. By steady valour, not by desperate onrush, the infantry\r\ncleared the height near Sagschütz and in perhaps fifteen minutes they\r\ntook the battery which crowned it. The Austrians and Bavarians made\r\nfurious efforts to regain what the flight of their comrades from\r\nWürtemburg had sacrificed. Nothing, however, could now withstand\r\nthe disciplined onset of the Prussians, who swept before them the\r\nshattered regiments and the breathless supports who hurried to their\r\naid. Hindered by ditches, the Prussian cavalry had as yet been able to\r\ngive little help, but the irresistible advance of the infantry brought\r\nthem at length to better ground and Zieten completed the ruin of the\r\nAustrian left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHARGE OF THE WALLOON DRAGOONS AT KOLIN.\r\n\r\nFROM A RELIEF ON THE MONUMENT OF VICTORY NEAR KŘEČHOŘ, UNVEILED 1898.]\r\n\r\nIn numbers, however, Prince Charles was still superior to his\r\nassailants. He might fairly ascribe the disaster on his left to the\r\nblunder by which the Würtembergers, mere auxiliaries, were entrusted\r\nwith the key of the position. Out of his unbroken centre and right\r\nhe formed a new line of battle of which Leuthen village was the key.\r\nLeuthen, with a wall of men and a hasty breastwork in front of it, with\r\nits courtyards and churchyard packed with men, and behind it men in\r\nthick masses with cannon, might surely be held until Luchesi and his\r\ncavalry could come to the rescue on the right.\r\n\r\nThe advanced guard was soon driven off by the terrible fire of the\r\nPrussians, whose heavy guns now and throughout the battle tore\r\nfrightful gaps in the crowded ranks of the enemy. But the village\r\nproved a formidable obstacle to their progress. House after house had\r\nto be stormed, and the churchyard was most difficult of all. At last\r\nthe Prussians carried Leuthen. Then, however, they were exposed to the\r\nbatteries behind and for perhaps an hour a furious conflict raged on\r\nsomething like equal terms. Frederick sent his left wing into action,\r\nbut still the Austrians stood firm. But again, when already three of\r\nthe four hours of daylight were spent, Luchesi proved to be the evil\r\ngenius of his side. Coming up with his cavalry, he took the Prussian\r\ninfantry in flank, only to be himself outflanked, crushed, and killed\r\nby a concealed reserve of Prussian cavalry. The panic produced by this\r\nsudden onslaught spread to the infantry, and the Prussians pressed\r\nhome their advantage with a bayonet charge. At last the Austrians were\r\nbeaten. They flung away their muskets, forsook their guns, and fled\r\nwildly towards Breslau. A regiment which strove to cover their flight\r\nwas reduced to one officer and eight men.\r\n\r\nAs at Rossbach, darkness robbed the victors of the full fruit of their\r\nsuccess. The Prussian loss of one man in five proved that Leuthen was\r\nno easy triumph. But they struck down 10,000 men and captured 12,000,\r\nthey put to flight an army nearly three times as great as their own,\r\nand they won Silesia and undying fame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR (_continued_)\r\n\r\nLEUTHEN TO MAXEN (DECEMBER, 1757, TO DECEMBER, 1759.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat profit would Leuthen bring to Prussia? was Frederick’s first\r\nthought after the glorious fifth of December, and may well be ours. He\r\nhimself was worn and ill. In the excitement of victory he had closed\r\nthe long day of Leuthen with a jest. Pressing on to the castle of\r\nLissa, he found it full of Austrian officers. “Bonjour, Messieurs,”\r\ncried the King, suddenly appearing out of the darkness, “can you find\r\nroom for me?” But reaction and depression followed the strain of 1757.\r\n“If the year upon which I am entering,” he wrote on his birthday\r\n(January 24, 1758), “is to be as cruel as that which is at an end, I\r\nhope it will be my last.”\r\n\r\nEvery kind of anxiety, public and private alike, pressed at the same\r\ntime upon the hero of Rossbach and Leuthen. His brother, Augustus\r\nWilliam, for whom a chance bullet might at any moment clear the throne,\r\nhad not yet succumbed under the burden of disgrace, and wearied\r\nFrederick with complaints and acid congratulations. His brother-in-law,\r\nFerdinand of Brunswick, was stricken with fever, and the King’s mind\r\nwas full of vague fears which he confessed but could not account for.\r\nUpon his sister, Wilhelmina, who had more need of it, he lavished\r\nsympathy and encouragement in a flood of tender messages.\r\n\r\n    “I am delighted that you are having some music and a little\r\n    dissipation,” he writes, early in the new year; “believe me,\r\n    dear Sister, there is nothing in life that can console us but a\r\n    little philosophy and the fine arts.... I swear to give thanks\r\n    to Heaven on the day when I can descend from the tight-rope on\r\n    which I am forced to dance.”\r\n\r\nIf we must choose a simile from the circus to describe Frederick\r\nduring this war, he might be likened to an acrobat juggling with five\r\nbomb-shells at once. Of three, the Swedes, the Russians, and the\r\nImperialists, he had not yet felt the full weight, and with a supreme\r\neffort he had flung the French and the Austrians high into the air.\r\nWhat would be his task in 1758?\r\n\r\nWhile he harvested the fruits of Leuthen without pause Frederick\r\npermitted himself to hope that his victory would bring peace. After the\r\nfall of Breslau on December 19, 1757, he estimated the Austrian losses\r\nand found them overwhelming. He even gave out that at a sacrifice of\r\nless than 4000 Prussians killed and wounded, he had reduced the enemy’s\r\nforce by 47,707 men. He was still gathering in prisoners and deserters\r\nevery day. Before the year was out he could assure Prince Henry that,\r\naccording to sound opinion, Prince Charles’s army consisted of no more\r\nthan 13,000 foot and 9000 horse. “If this does not lead to peace,”\r\nwrites Frederick on December 21st, “no success in war will ever pave\r\nthe way thither.” A week later he is still hopeful, “but even if one\r\nwere sure of it, we must none the less labour to make our position\r\nformidable, since force is the only argument that one can use with\r\nthese dogs of Kings and Emperors.” Leuthen indeed gave Maria Theresa\r\nanother opportunity to prove her constancy and courage. Frederick\r\nmade overtures to her for peace, but she refused to engage in any\r\nnegotiation apart from her allies. Early in January, 1758, the King\r\nbecame aware that Austria whatever it might cost her, was determined on\r\nanother campaign.\r\n\r\nGradually the prospect grew clearer. Almost beyond the hopes of the\r\nQueen her alliance with France survived the double shock of Rossbach\r\nand Leuthen. At the beginning of February Louis promised to send 24,000\r\nmen into Bohemia. Since his encounter with Soubise, Frederick regarded\r\nthe French as brigands rather than warriors, but their onset compelled\r\nhim to place a sturdy watch-dog in the West. This part was played\r\nby Ferdinand of Brunswick, who drove them across the Rhine before\r\nMarch was over. Another foe, the Swedes, were even less considerable.\r\nFrederick jeered at them as “cautious people who run away eighty miles\r\nso as not to be taken,” and assured his sister, the Queen of Sweden, of\r\nhis willingness to grant them peace. So long as France was willing to\r\npay subsidies, however, the Swedes were willing to provide 30,000 men.\r\nThey still occupied their “bastion,” Pomerania, in force, and therefore\r\nLehwaldt must still act as the Ferdinand of the North. The King himself\r\nproposed to astonish Europe by his dealings with the Austrians and\r\nImperialists. From his ally he might look for the same assistance as in\r\nthe previous year. He laboured in vain to persuade the Sea Powers that\r\nthe Protestant cause and their own interests demanded that they should\r\nattack France with their own troops. But in April Pitt undertook to\r\nfurnish an annual subsidy of £670,000, and for four years the money was\r\npunctually paid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map for the SILESIAN AND SEVEN YEARS WARS\r\n\r\n_G. P. Putnam’s Sons, London & New York._]\r\n\r\nWith Silesia at his back, the French and Swedes held in check, and\r\nEngland in close alliance, Frederick’s prospects for the campaign\r\nof 1758 might seem almost brilliant. He had some 206,000 men under\r\narms. Ready money was not plentiful, but Frederick procured it in\r\na thoroughly Prussian fashion—unscrupulous but practical. His own\r\nsubjects he spared so far as possible. At times indeed he treated even\r\nthem in the manner of his father. In January, 1758, the merchants\r\nof Breslau answered “Impossible” to a royal demand that they should\r\nadvance 300,000 thalers to the Jews who had charge of the coinage.\r\nFrederick’s minister reported the fact, adding that the Jews enjoyed\r\nno credit in the mercantile world. The King’s annotation, scrawled in\r\nGerman on the back of the report, is still treasured in the archives\r\npf the General Staff at Berlin, It runs as follows: “I will cook\r\nsomething for the President if he don’t get the money out of those\r\nmerchants at once without arguing.”\r\n\r\nIn general, however, with the exception of a few loans, no new demands\r\nwere made upon the ill-lined purses of the Prussians. Indirectly,\r\nof course, they felt the burden of the war. The coin with which the\r\nState supplied them was debased and therefore purchased less goods.\r\nThe pensions of those who had served the King in the past, but could\r\nserve him no longer, were left unpaid or paid only in paper. But\r\nthe chief granary of the Prussian army was, whenever possible, the\r\nterritory of the enemy. The second great source of supplies consisted\r\nin those countries which the fortune of war had placed in their hands.\r\n“Mark well the contributions of Mecklenburg,” was Frederick’s order\r\nto General Dohna. “Take hostages, and threaten the Duke’s bailiffs\r\nwith fire and plundering to make them pay promptly.” But by far the\r\nheaviest burden fell upon the Saxons. Besides systematically draining\r\nthem of cash, Frederick resorted to what he termed “reprisals” at their\r\nexpense whenever “the allies of the King of Poland” pillaged any of\r\nhis dominions. Men who were thus made scapegoats for the sins of half\r\nEurope betrayed with seasonable treachery the allegiance which the King\r\nof Prussia had compelled them to swear against their will.\r\n\r\nIn 1758, however, Frederick allowed the notorious disaffection of the\r\nSaxons to fetter him no more than the armies of France and Sweden. He\r\nhad a great plan of campaign, and he began to execute it with a speed\r\nand secrecy which no one in the world could equal. On March 15th he\r\nleft Breslau. Within five weeks he had captured Schweidnitz, the sole\r\nfortress in Silesia which remained Austrian, and was making for Moravia\r\nin order to besiege Olmütz. The Austrians, he argued, must relieve it\r\nand might be vanquished in a battle in which he would have choice of\r\nground. Olmütz could then be taken and Vienna threatened. This would\r\ncompel the enemy to concentrate in defence of the capital. Prince Henry\r\nwould thus be free to swoop down from Dresden upon Bohemia and to erase\r\nthe traces of Kolin.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s idea was brilliant, and for a time success waited upon\r\nhis arms. Daun, who, to the great profit of the Austrians, had\r\nreplaced Prince Charles in the chief command, continued to fortify\r\nBohemia against the attack which he expected from the East. On May 3rd\r\nFrederick reached Olmütz. Consternation reigned at Vienna, but for\r\neight weeks the cautious Daun did not venture to disturb the siege.\r\nTill the last day of June all went well. Then came what the King\r\nfrankly terms a terrible _contretemps_. At Domstädtl a convoy of some\r\n4000 waggons from Neisse was destroyed by General Laudon, who made\r\nhimself a great name by a victory which cost Zieten’s command at least\r\n2400 men. The Prussians were thus deprived of the supplies which were\r\nindispensable to their success.\r\n\r\nFrederick recognised at once that the siege must be abandoned, and with\r\nit his whole enterprise. He admitted that he had lost the superiority\r\nover the Austrians which he had gained in 1757. Threatening to\r\nimprison and cashier officers who should make faces or say that all\r\nwas lost, he slipped cleverly past Daun’s left into Bohemia, and for a\r\nmonth remained there at his ease. Then he sped swiftly northward. On\r\nAugust 22, 1758, he was at Cüstrin dictating a fresh testament on the\r\neve of the encounter with a new and gigantic foe.\r\n\r\nIn estimating Frederick’s prospects for the campaign of 1758, no\r\naccount has yet been taken of Russia. The action of the Muscovite\r\nforces was proverbially uncertain and of necessity slow. It was\r\npossible that they would not influence the main struggle at all, or\r\nthat Frederick’s plan of aggression in the South would be accomplished\r\nbefore they had time to become formidable. Since the New Year, however,\r\nstorm-clouds had been massing to the north-eastward. It is fortunately\r\nno part of our task to peer behind them into the dark secrets of the\r\nRussian court. Suffice it to say that Elizabeth still lived, and\r\nthat so long as she remained on the throne peace with Prussia was\r\nimpossible. Her armies might be ill-found and her ministers corrupt,\r\nbut it would be strange if the mistress of Russia proved too weak to\r\nwound Frederick in his ill-guarded flank beyond the Oder.\r\n\r\nFermor received the chief command of an army 34,000 strong. In January,\r\n1758, he overran Ost-Preussen and forced the inhabitants to swear\r\nfealty to the Czarina. In February Königsberg was illuminated in honour\r\nof Russian royalty. Frederick avenged the first offence by reprisals\r\nupon the Saxons, the second by withdrawing his favour for ever from\r\nthe polluted province. His power of self-restraint is attested by\r\nthe fact that he attempted nothing by way of rescue. He calculated\r\ndispassionately that Fermor’s advance would at best be slow, that a\r\nbroad expanse of barren Polish territory separated the invader from\r\nthe rest of the Prussian dominions, and that offensive action in the\r\nSouth was more likely to be profitable than defensive in the North.\r\nKönigsberg had been a Russian city for more than three months when\r\nFrederick dashed into Moravia.\r\n\r\nThe danger, however, grew greater throughout the summer months. The\r\nMuscovite tide rolled slowly across Poland into Frederick’s dominions\r\neast of the Oder. Europe now had an opportunity of learning something\r\nof the nature of the society which Peter the Great had brought within\r\nher pale. In the Russian army, as in the nation, the highest classes\r\nwere men of honour when not too sorely tried, but the lowest were\r\nfilthy savages, who made the country a desert and tortured and burned\r\nmen and women alike. What the rank and file might be, Frederick had yet\r\nto learn. But that his trusted field-marshal, Keith, gave him timely\r\nwarning, he might well have been pardoned for his belief that Fermor’s\r\nunseasoned horde would not face the heroes of Leuthen led by himself,\r\nthe foremost captain in the world.\r\n\r\nAs the King sped towards his old prison, Cüstrin, the trembling\r\npeasants came in crowds to kiss the hem of his coat. He found the\r\nfortress unharmed, but the defenceless town reduced to ashes by\r\nFermor’s bombs. The Russians, more than 40,000 strong, lay on the\r\neastern side of the Oder, having an open road to Poland, but all others\r\nbarred by swamps and rivers. Before Frederick’s arrival, Dohna, with\r\nperhaps a third of their numbers, the waters of the Oder, and the walls\r\nof Cüstrin had been the only defences of Berlin. Now, however, the\r\nPrussians were some 36,000 strong and as much superior to their foes in\r\nmobility as were Drake and Hawkins to the Spanish Armada. Fermor was\r\nshort of supplies. He could not go forward and had hundreds of miles of\r\ndesert at his rear. Was the time at the King’s disposal so scanty that\r\nhe could not starve, harry, and crush the enemy without the sacrifice\r\nof more than a few hundred Prussian lives?\r\n\r\nFrederick was, however, in no mood for a war of strategy. He had\r\npublished his fixed resolve to conquer or die. He was impatient to\r\nreturn to Silesia, where he had left 40,000 men under Charles of\r\nBrandenburg-Schwedt. He was still more impatient to annihilate the\r\nbloody vagabonds, who, he wrote, were burning villages every day and\r\ncommitting horrors which made Nature groan. In the spirit of Leuthen,\r\nthough perhaps without like need, he resolved to attack Fermor without\r\nan hour’s delay. Knowing every inch of the dismal country-side, he\r\nswiftly planned a massacre that should avenge the past and safeguard\r\nthe future. The Russians had abandoned the siege of Cüstrin and taken\r\nup a position so sheltered by the Oder and its tributary, the Mietzel,\r\nthat Fermor believed it to be unassailable. Frederick crossed the Oder\r\nsome miles below Cüstrin, marched right round their camp, and prepared\r\nto hurl them into the waters in which they trusted for defence.\r\n\r\nThe plan seems a sound one only on the supposition that Keith’s opinion\r\nwas ill-founded and that the Russians would not show fight. They had\r\nmuch in their favour. They were a national army, roused to enthusiasm\r\nby the benedictions of a mob of orthodox popes. They outnumbered the\r\nenemy and were far better furnished with cannon. In cavalry, it is\r\ntrue, Frederick had a great advantage, but this was discounted by the\r\nRussian formation in dense masses, which cavalry could hardly hope\r\nto pierce. Above all, the King provided his opponents with the best\r\npossible argument against running away when he left them no road by\r\nwhich to run. With no alternative save drowning or suffocation, the\r\nRussians chose to die where they stood, but to sell their lives dear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF ZORNDORF, AUGUST 25, 1758.]\r\n\r\nThese conditions made the battle fought near Zorndorf on August\r\n25, 1758, one of the bloodiest of the whole war. It was in great\r\npart a desperate hand-to-hand struggle, kept up with mutual fury\r\nuntil the Russians were cut to pieces. According to the Prussian\r\nhistories, Seydlitz, the matchless dragoon, refused point-blank to\r\nobey Frederick’s order to advance on the Russian guns. When and where\r\nneeded, he replied, he would be at hand with his men. “After the\r\nbattle,” came the King’s message, “you will answer for it with your\r\nhead.” “After the battle,” answered the imperturbable general,\r\n“my head will be at the service of the King.” He justified his\r\ninsubordination by twice charging at the enemy on his own initiative.\r\nHe thereby saved the day, and, instead of being cashiered, was embraced\r\nby his delighted master. But when the issue had once been decided by\r\nsheer rage maintained for ten hours, some of the Prussian infantry\r\nshowed themselves equally insubordinate and less successful. It seems\r\nnot the least strange feature of this chaotic death-grapple that in an\r\nattack upon an army strongly posted the cavalry should have formed the\r\nchief factor in Frederick’s success.\r\n\r\nSuccess, though much qualified, Frederick might indeed fairly claim.\r\nFermor, it is true, bivouacked on the field, fought again, though\r\nlanguidly, next day, sent off bulletins of victory, and retired\r\nunmolested a week later. His troops had endured the Prussian whirlwind\r\nwith a steadfastness beyond all praise. But of the 30,000 killed and\r\nwounded nearly two-thirds were his, and Frederick had achieved, though\r\nat a great cost, his prime object of securing his dominions on the\r\neastern side.\r\n\r\nAgainst a new foe the King had displayed once more those qualities\r\nwhich readers of his history have by this time learned to regard as\r\ncharacteristic of him. He had been brave, secret, and masterful, swift\r\nto plan and to carry out, tireless in body and teeming in brain. He\r\nhad at the same time proved himself exacting, overbearing, and rash,\r\nadroit at supplying the need of the moment rather than far-sighted and\r\nsagacious in providing for the future. Though he accepted victory and\r\ndefeat like a philosopher, there was too much of the despot, both in\r\nwhat he exacted from his troops and in what he expected from his foes.\r\nIn this, though in this alone, it seemed as though the common infirmity\r\nof the overpowerful had at last assailed a Hohenzollern, and that\r\nFrederick had lost something of his power of seeing facts as they are.\r\nAll the torrents of Prussian blood wasted at Prague, at Kolin, and at\r\nZorndorf had not swept away his belief that Prussians led by himself\r\ncould carry out any order that he chose to give.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly these virtues and foibles of the King that shape the\r\nstory of the remaining months of the campaign. While he was on the\r\nbanks of the Oder the Austrians and Imperialists had begun the\r\nreconquest of Saxony and Silesia. Frederick by speed and cleverness\r\nsaved both, but his conceit doomed nearly nine thousand of his army to\r\nwounds, captivity, or death.\r\n\r\nFirst, by wonderful marches, he snatched Dresden from the jaws of\r\nDaun. The cautious general took up a strong position, which barred\r\nFrederick’s road to Silesia, where the Austrians were besieging Neisse.\r\nHaving failed to tempt him to battle, Frederick next stole round his\r\narmy, but Daun retorted with a similar manœuvre and encamped near\r\nHochkirch with some 65,000 men. On October 10th, Frederick with less\r\nthan half the number actually insisted upon occupying an untenable\r\nposition hard by. His generals, among whom were the Young Dessauer,\r\nSeydlitz, and Zieten, remonstrated with him in vain. Next day Keith\r\narrived and spoke his mind quite frankly: “If the Austrians leave us\r\nquiet in a position like this, they deserve to be hanged.” “It is to\r\nbe hoped that they fear us more than the gallows,” rejoined the King,\r\nand planned a flank attack on Daun, who, he believed, was about to\r\nretreat into Bohemia. The result was that before daybreak, on October\r\n14, 1758, the Prussian camp was surprised. Five generals, Keith among\r\nthem, perished. Frederick’s obstinate foolhardiness cost him more than\r\none-fourth of his army, with more than a hundred guns and much material\r\nof war. Kolin, Domstädtl, and Hochkirch, three victories over the\r\nKing of Prussia within sixteen months, formed a splendid chaplet for\r\na general whose forte was caution. The Pope was said to have rewarded\r\nDaun with a consecrated hat and sword.\r\n\r\n“It may be safely reckoned,” so the King informed the Berlin public a\r\nweek later, “that our loss does not exceed 3000 men.... These disasters\r\nare sometimes inevitable in the great game of chance which we call\r\nwar.” The hour of disaster had again proved Frederick superior to the\r\nshrewdest blows of Fate. At the moment when the Austrians, creeping\r\nthrough the darkness, began to butcher his men in their tents, he\r\nproved himself once more a hero. Disdaining to order a retreat, he\r\nextricated his army from its terrible position and formed a new line\r\nonly half a league to the rear. Daun, who had lost more than 6000 men,\r\nentrenched himself on the field, and was soon plying his old trade of\r\ncircumspectly hanging upon the skirts of the foe. Within ten days of\r\nthe battle Frederick robbed him of the fruits of victory by marching\r\nround him once more. He flung himself between Daun and the besiegers of\r\nNeisse, and Silesia was saved.\r\n\r\nDaun’s counterstroke was, as was almost inevitable, an invasion of\r\nSaxony while Frederick’s back was turned. He alarmed Dresden, but was\r\nonce more frustrated by Prussian speed. Frederick hurried back in time\r\nto save both Saxony and its capital. In mid-December he went into\r\nwinter quarters at Breslau, master of dominions as broad as when he had\r\nquitted the city nine months before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF HOCHKIRCH, OCTOBER 14, 1758.]\r\n\r\nIn those months he had, however, lost much that cannot be marked upon\r\nthe map. Faithful officers by hundreds, trained soldiers by thousands,\r\nhard-wrung thalers by millions had been sacrificed, and nothing but\r\nglory and a respite had been gained. No lands outside Ost-Preussen\r\nwere as yet conquered by foreign kings, but many had been wasted by\r\nforeign armies, and some, at the dictate of urgent need, by their\r\nown defenders. These losses weighed upon Frederick, whose task it\r\nwas to gather men and money for next year. But as a man he had cause\r\nfor more poignant grief, for Death had knocked hard at the door of\r\nhis own household. The loss of his heir, Augustus William, once his\r\nfather’s favourite, now the victim of Frederick’s cruelty, probably\r\nafflicted him only because Prince Henry avenged it by refusing to see\r\nhim except on business. But the death of Wilhelmina, who died on the\r\neve of Hochkirch, was the most crushing calamity of his life. “Great\r\nGod, my Sister of Baireuth!” scrawled the afflicted King as postscript\r\nto a brief despatch in cipher to his brother Henry. The message is\r\nmore pregnant than much fine writing. “The death of Her Highness the\r\nMargravine of Baireuth embarrasses me with regard to His Majesty the\r\nKing more than all war matters,” wrote the faithful Eichel from Dresden\r\non the day after Frederick received the news, “since I can judge how\r\nhighly afflicting and crushing it must be to him. Councillor Coeper\r\nwrites to me yesterday that although every care was taken to prepare\r\nHis Majesty gradually for sad tidings it has none the less made an\r\nindescribably great impression upon him, and he does not believe that\r\ndeeper woe is possible.” “If my head had within it a lake of tears it\r\nwould not be enough for my grief,” sighed the King to another mourner,\r\nKeith’s brother, when the hard fighting and marching came to an end.\r\n\r\nAfter three campaigns the war had now, at the close of the year 1758,\r\nreached what may be called a chronic state. Thrice had Frederick\r\nlunged at the heart of his enemies and each time they had parried the\r\nthrust. At Vienna alone could the coalition receive a mortal wound. St.\r\nPetersburg, Stockholm, and Paris were equally out of reach, and the\r\nStates of the Empire might be squeezed and harried for ever without\r\nterminating the war. If the Prussians failed to dictate peace at\r\nVienna, their one hope must be that they might defend themselves until\r\nsome of the hostile Powers should change their minds. Their opponents,\r\ntoo, felt the strain of prolonged and unprofitable war. It was true\r\nthat they had not to strain themselves like the nation whose very\r\nexistence was at stake, but neither Russia nor Austria nor France knew\r\nthe secret of Prussian thrift. The time might come when even Elizabeth\r\nand the Pompadour would confess that the game was no longer worth the\r\ncandle. The French, in particular, were not all blind to the fact that\r\nthey were losing their Empire to England in order to gratify the spite\r\nof the King’s mistress against the King of Prussia. Would they hold to\r\nthe Austrian alliance even for another year?\r\n\r\nThe event falsified the hopes of Frederick. With some relaxation of\r\nintimacy, the Austro-French league was renewed, and the King perceived\r\nthat he must henceforward hold Prussia like a huge beleaguered\r\nfortress. Five Powers were still encamped upon his frontiers and\r\nready to break in upon him. Like all resolute garrisons, therefore,\r\nthe Prussians had recourse to sallies, and some of these met with\r\nmuch success. By sudden forays Henry and Ferdinand destroyed the\r\nmagazines that were being formed by the Austrians and Imperialists and\r\nso retarded the invasion of Prussia, which could not proceed without\r\nthem. Mere partisan inroads like these were, however, insufficient\r\nto prevent Daun from taking up a strong position at Mark-Lissa, with\r\nBohemia at his back and Saxony and Silesia open on either hand. There\r\nhe menaced Frederick while the Russian host once more drew near to the\r\nOder, overthrowing as it came a Prussian force which had been sent into\r\nPoland to destroy its magazines and pen it in the swamps of the Vistula.\r\n\r\nThe story of this Polish campaign throws much light on the strength\r\nand weakness of the Prussian army. Rightly neglecting the lesser danger\r\nin order to make adequate head against the greater, the King had sent\r\nagainst the Russians the force which usually defended the North against\r\nthe Swedes. The rank and file were good, but without leadership they\r\ncould accomplish nothing. “Your Polish campaign deserves to be printed\r\nas an eternal example of what every intelligent officer must avoid.\r\nYou have done every silly thing which can be done in war and nothing\r\nwhatever that an intelligent man can approve. I tremble to open my\r\nletters.” Such were the concluding words of a long indictment which\r\nFrederick addressed to their commander, General Wobersnow.\r\n\r\nNothing but the royal presence, it seemed, could save the situation.\r\nThe King himself was not yet free to leave Daun. He therefore invented\r\na deputy-king, and despatched General Wedell to Poland “with the powers\r\nof a Dictator in Roman times.” Twelve curt instructions were drafted\r\nfor his guidance. He was “(4) to forbid lamentation and depreciatory\r\ntalk among the officers on pain of dismissal. (5) To disgrace also\r\nthose who cry out on every occasion that the enemy is too strong. (6)\r\nFirst to check the enemy by occupying a good position. (7) Then to\r\nattack in my own fashion.” From the King’s own lips Wedell received the\r\norder to fight the Russians whenever he should find them, and officers\r\nand men alike were commanded to obey him as though he were indeed the\r\nKing. But Frederick was never sanguine that these attempts to win a\r\nRussian Leuthen by proxy would succeed. His instructions were followed\r\nto the letter, and within four days he was condoling with the Dictator\r\nupon the disaster of Kay (July 23, 1759), where the Prussians lost more\r\nthan 8000 men killed and wounded. Nothing could now hold back Soltykoff\r\nand his Russians from the Oder, and across the Oder lay Frederick’s\r\nhelpless capital.\r\n\r\nBut worse was yet in store. The Russians, for all their numbers and\r\ntheir greed, were ill-fed, irresolute, and slow. They dreaded the\r\nvictor of Zorndorf and they were determined not to be the catspaw\r\nof their allies. If only they could be kept at a distance from the\r\nAustrians they might starve before they could agree upon the next step\r\nin advance. From Kay to Mark-Lissa is some ninety miles as the crow\r\nflies, and the Oder and Frederick’s army lay between. To strengthen\r\nthe barrier the King was prepared even to leave Saxony almost without\r\ndefence. He summoned Henry to observe Daun while he himself made “cruel\r\nand terrible marches” through the burning sand towards Wedell in the\r\nNorth. So severe was the strain that he passed six of the torrid nights\r\nwithout sleep. But he was racing a fleet adversary—Laudon, the hero of\r\nDomstädtl and probably the best partisan soldier in the world. Knowing\r\nthat he had served ten years in the Russian army, Daun now detached him\r\nwith 36,000 men to allay Soltykoff’s suspicions of the Austrians and to\r\nspeed his coming. Frederick disturbed the march, but started too late\r\nto stop it altogether. When Laudon found the Russians at Frankfurt he\r\nwas still master of nearly 20,000 men.\r\n\r\nThis reinforcement vastly increased the effectiveness of Soltykoff’s\r\narmy as a fighting force. The Russians were well furnished with guns,\r\nand their infantry had proved its toughness at Zorndorf. But their\r\ncavalry was bad and Laudon added to it some 6000 men, well-mounted and\r\nwell-trained. None the less he was received with extreme discourtesy.\r\nThe Russians abused him because he brought no supplies. They refused\r\nto cross the Oder unless Daun’s whole army should appear. Until fresh\r\norders from St. Petersburg produced some change of tone, Laudon felt\r\ncertain that they were on the eve of retreat. Then came the news that\r\nthe King of Prussia was upon them and the voice of discord was hushed.\r\n\r\nFrederick had set himself a harder task than the destruction of Fermor\r\non the banks of the Oder in 1758. Only overwhelming necessity made him\r\ngive battle. He suspected that an Austrian detachment was threatening\r\nhis capital. “I believe that Hadik means Berlin,” he wrote, “and I\r\nam obliged to make haste here to parry his blow in time. A lost soul\r\nin purgatory is not in a more wretched situation than I am.” In mere\r\nnumbers, it is true, the disparity between the combatants was not much\r\ngreater than at Zorndorf. Frederick had now nearly 50,000 men against\r\na composite force of about 68,000, but of the enemy nearly one-quarter\r\nwere light horse, who in the shock of battle counted for next to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nIn quality and in position, however, his army was worse off than\r\nbefore, while the enemy was much better. In the previous year he had\r\nled seasoned troops whose ranks had been purged by incessant marches\r\nunder a scorching sun to join the army of Dohna, which was at least\r\nunbeaten and unwearied. Their meeting had provoked one of Frederick’s\r\nbest-remembered sayings: “Your men have made themselves wonderfully\r\nsmart; mine look like grass-devils, but they can bite.” Now, however, a\r\ngreat part of his command consisted of troops mishandled by Wobersnow\r\nand decimated by the Russians at Kay. It was unlikely that they would\r\nfight like the victors of Leuthen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF KUNERSDORF, AUGUST 12, 1759.]\r\n\r\nNor was Frederick favoured by the ground. The most casual glance at\r\nthe two fields is sufficient to show that Kunersdorf, the scene of the\r\nbloody drama of August 12, 1759, presented difficulties such as the\r\nassailant at Zorndorf never had to overcome. The allies were again\r\nencamped on the right bank of the Oder, and were now separated by the\r\nbroad river from the town of Frankfurt. To march round their position\r\nwas far more arduous than at Zorndorf. Their left wing was shielded\r\nby impassable morasses, and the right by forest. Behind them lay a\r\nfortress commanding a well-bridged river, before them a tangled mass\r\nof sand-hills, woods, and lakes which seemed to have been designed by\r\nnature to impede an attacking force and which was now made still more\r\nformidable by art. This position, even if the 16,000 irregulars be\r\nignored, was held by some 40,000 Russians, now veterans in western\r\nwarfare, aided by 13,000 of the flower of the Austrian army under a\r\ncaptain worthy to cross swords with Frederick himself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the King had still Seydlitz, but such men as\r\nWedell could ill supply the place of Schwerin, the Old Dessauer, and\r\nKeith. Some of his troops were men who had fled before the Russians\r\nevery year, at Gross-Jägersdorf, at Zorndorf, and at Kay, and whom he\r\ncould not even trust. Owing to the difficulties of the ground and the\r\nKing’s impatience, most of the Prussians went into action suffering\r\nunder privations that would have well-nigh killed ordinary men. They\r\nlacked food and drink. After two nights without sleep they must drag\r\nthemselves and their accoutrements through a manœuvre of nine hours’\r\nduration, now tugging cannon through pine-woods, now clambering over\r\nsand-hills under the broiling August sun. Then at noon they were\r\nordered to attack an enemy more numerous than themselves who was\r\nresting quietly behind entrenchments in ground of his own choosing.\r\n\r\nThat they accomplished what they did proves that the Prussians were\r\nheroes. Frederick’s design was, as at Zorndorf, to cross the Oder below\r\nthe Russian camp, to march round it, and then to strike. But the barren\r\nwaste east of Frankfurt was to him unfamiliar country. At Leuthen and\r\nat Zorndorf he had profited greatly by his knowledge of the field. But\r\nat Kunersdorf he knew neither the difficulties of the ground nor the\r\nextent to which, in one most important particular, those difficulties\r\nhad been surmounted by the enemy. When he scanned their position from\r\nthe north-east before completing his plan of attack, he could discern\r\nLaudon’s force encamped in a seemingly isolated peninsula in the\r\ngreat marsh which protected the left. He was informed that Laudon and\r\nSoltykoff could communicate only by a roundabout way. Not till the\r\nissue of the day was dubious did he learn that a new causeway connected\r\nthe Austrians with the main body of the enemy, and the error proved\r\nfatal. Twice in his life Frederick paid dear for imperfect information,\r\nbut the price of the blunder at Prague was a trifle by the side of the\r\nprice paid here.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the fray was such as to make the end a doubly crushing\r\nblow to the King. After long and toilsome preparations it seemed as\r\nthough victory was assured. When the Prussian van went into action\r\nthey advanced like fresh men and turned the Russians out of their\r\nentrenchments at the point of the bayonet. A second onslaught, better\r\nsupported, took the enemy in flank and by two o’clock the Russian left\r\nwas beaten, with a loss of seventy guns. Frederick sent off a courier\r\nto carry the tidings of victory to Berlin. The third attack, however,\r\nmade on difficult ground in the face of cannon at 800 yards and\r\nmusketeers at fifty, did not succeed until the Prussian infantry had\r\nbeen decimated and its strength almost spent. At this point Frederick’s\r\ngenerals cried “Enough”; but the King, as at Hochkirch, preferred his\r\nown opinion. Once more the Prussians stormed forward and for the\r\nfourth time they annihilated the Russian line. If one knoll more, the\r\nSpitzberg, and the battery upon it were taken, the victory, it seemed,\r\nwould be complete.\r\n\r\nBut at this crisis Laudon intervened to save the battery and the day.\r\nHis grenadiers climbed the knoll when the Prussians were still 150\r\npaces from the top, and drove them back with a volley of case-shot.\r\nFrederick ordered up his artillery, but the heavy guns stuck fast in\r\nthe sand and light field-pieces were of no avail. In the agony of the\r\nmoment the King lost his head and ordered the cavalry to storm the\r\nSpitzberg. As at Zorndorf, Seydlitz declined to sacrifice his troops\r\nto a blunder, but this time Frederick was deaf to the voice of reason.\r\nHe repeated the order and was obeyed. Seydlitz was wounded and his\r\nsuperb squadrons shattered, without the smallest gain. A crushing\r\ncountercharge headed by Laudon completed the ruin of the Prussian\r\nhorse, and thenceforward the allies were the attacking side.\r\n\r\nFrederick, almost beside himself, continued to demand victory from his\r\nmen, and the infantry, though it could not go forward, held its ground\r\nagainst the Russians. Laudon, however, contrived the _coup de grâce_.\r\nAt about five o’clock he suddenly hurled a fresh Austrian host upon\r\nthe heroes who had been fifteen hours under arms. The overthrow was\r\ncomplete. Frederick, who sought death in vain, was borne from the field\r\nby a party of his own hussars. Amid the chaos he wrote a terse note in\r\nFrench to inform his capital that the game was up. “My coat is riddled\r\nwith balls; two horses were killed under me; it is my misfortune to be\r\nstill alive. Our loss is great; not 3000 men out of 48,000 are with\r\nme. At this moment all are in flight and I am no longer master of my\r\ntroops.”\r\n\r\nThe King’s first thought was that he himself was crushed and that\r\ntherefore Prussia was ruined. There was indeed good reason for his\r\ndespair. Even if Soltykoff should allow him to recross the Oder and to\r\nrally the remnants of his army he dared not hope to save Berlin. He had\r\nfought at Kunersdorf in the belief that an Austrian force under Hadik\r\nwas advancing towards his capital from the south. If he now attacked\r\nHadik he must expose his rear to the victors of Kunersdorf; if he stood\r\nfirm against them, Hadik would take him in flank. “Only a miracle could\r\nsave us,” wrote the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of his country seemed inevitable and Frederick was\r\nresolved not to witness it. For years he had carried poison. Before\r\nusing it he spent two days in arranging his affairs. On the plea of\r\na severe illness, he entrusted the army to General Finck and gave\r\ndirections that it should swear allegiance to the son of Augustus\r\nWilliam. He advised the well-to-do citizens of Berlin to fly to\r\nHamburg, the Government to make Magdeburg their asylum, and Schmettau,\r\nthe commandant at Dresden, to surrender on good terms if he saw no\r\nmeans of succour when attacked.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s life-drama, it seemed, was played out, but the curtain did\r\nnot fall. The allies, who had bought victory dear, made no move, and\r\non the fourth day after the battle the King was himself again. “All my\r\ntroops have done wonders,” had been his words when he gave up hope. Now\r\nhe sent a new version to the same correspondent, Finckenstein. “The\r\nvictory was ours, when suddenly my wretched infantry lost courage.\r\nThe silly fear of being carried off to Siberia turned their head and\r\nthere was no stopping them.” His loss at Kunersdorf amounted to at\r\nleast 18,500 men, but he found himself master of an army 20,000 strong.\r\nThey were, he said, not to be compared with the worst troops of former\r\nyears, but he prepared to sacrifice them and himself for the defence of\r\nthe capital, and awaited Soltykoff on the river Spree.\r\n\r\nA letter to Prince Henry written on August 16, 1759, shows the temper\r\nof the Prussian Leonidas.\r\n\r\n    “The moment that I sent you word of our mishap everything\r\n    seemed desperate. Do not think that the danger is not still\r\n    very great, but be assured that until my eyes are closed I\r\n    will sustain the State, as is my duty. A case that I had in my\r\n    pocket was smashed by a shot, but saved my leg. We are all in\r\n    tatters; there is hardly anyone who has not had two or three\r\n    balls through his clothes or his hat. But we would cheerfully\r\n    sacrifice our wardrobe, if that were all.”\r\n\r\nDespite these signs of reviving courage, Frederick felt with tenfold\r\nintensity what he expressed years afterwards when he said that after\r\nKunersdorf the enemy had only to give him the finishing stroke. Yet\r\nit is highly characteristic of him that already his thoughts ran upon\r\nanother battle. To carry on defensive warfare, he argued, the support\r\nof a fortress was indispensable. But he had only Cüstrin and Spandau to\r\nchoose from, and to sit down near either would be to sacrifice Berlin.\r\nDesperate evils, he held, needed desperate remedies, and he would court\r\nFortune sword in hand. Eight days after Kunersdorf he hoped soon to\r\nhave 33,000 men in his camp, but he protested that he feared them more\r\nthan the enemy. “I count on the firmness and honesty of Pitt, and it is\r\non him alone that we can at this juncture base some hope.”\r\n\r\nFrederick expected day by day the catastrophe of Prussia. Yet the only\r\ndirect result of Kunersdorf was that for a time he lost a great part of\r\nSaxony. Early in September Dresden was wrested from him by the motley\r\narmy of the Empire, which was accounted the most despicable member of\r\nthe coalition. Schmettau had acted too mechanically in following the\r\nKing’s counsels of despair. But the Swedes, though their opponents\r\nhad withdrawn, failed to strike south. The French, who had set out\r\nin earnest to conquer Hanover, were routed at Minden by Ferdinand of\r\nBrunswick on August 1, 1759. They were driven headlong through the\r\nnarrow gorge at the spot where the Weser cleaves the bulwark of hills\r\nwhich guards the northern plain, and thus before the day of Kunersdorf\r\nFrederick knew that he had nothing to fear on the western side. But\r\nhow, it may well be wondered, could Daun and Soltykoff, with 120,000\r\nmen at their disposal and only half the number against them, neglect\r\nto follow up their victory? The sequel even suggests that Frederick’s\r\ndesperate measures beyond the Oder had been superfluous. Prussia was\r\nfar weaker than before, yet she did not fall. The King was crippled,\r\nAustrians and Russians were now massed into one unbroken force, triumph\r\nat Dresden followed triumph at Kunersdorf, yet they accomplished\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nTheir opponents, it is true, were tacticians of the first rank. Prince\r\nHenry, by wonderful marches, evaded Daun, and Frederick, returning\r\nto the Oder, frustrated all Soltykoff’s efforts to gain Silesia.\r\nIt was, moreover, beyond the power of Daun to furnish the Russians\r\nwith supplies, and if their ally did not supply them they refused\r\npoint-blank to proceed. But the chief cause of Prussia’s salvation\r\nwas that victory, though it united the armies of her enemies, could\r\nnot unite their interests. Russians and Austrians remained as before\r\nseparate armies with divergent interests to consult. At no time did\r\nFrederick draw greater profit than after Kunersdorf from the fact that\r\nPrussia was one and her opponents many.\r\n\r\nSoon Berlin breathed freely and even Breslau felt safe. Before\r\nOctober was at an end Soltykoff was marching home, while Daun was\r\nstruggling to save Dresden at least from Prince Henry’s reconquest of\r\nSaxony. The _Te Deums_ ceased at Vienna and dejection reigned there.\r\nDaun’s sluggishness in aggressive action extinguished the renown\r\ndue to his triumphs of defence. His wife dared not show herself in\r\npublic. At court the story ran that she opened a package addressed\r\nto the Field-marshal, and discovered that some wag had mocked his\r\nsluggishness by sending him a night-cap.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, however, it would have been well for Prussia if her\r\nKing’s activity had been less superhuman. Flushed with the triumph\r\nof his strategy and confident of the devotion of Pitt, he had the\r\naudacity to demand that compensation for Prussia should be the basis\r\nof negotiation for peace. During the greater part of October, 1759,\r\nhe was tormented by gout and fever. He spent his enforced leisure in\r\nwriting an essay on Charles XII., the Madman of the North, a warrior\r\nwho would have prized the bloody afternoon of Kunersdorf far more than\r\nthe strategy which drove Soltykoff empty-handed from Silesia. Then,\r\nwhen the Russian peril had vanished, Frederick set out in a litter for\r\nSaxony. “I am very weak, but although still a cripple, I will do all\r\nthat my feebleness allows me to attempt,” he wrote on November 4th. His\r\nheart beat high with the hope of repeating the miracles of 1757, and of\r\nregaining, by a new Leuthen, all that had been lost during the summer,\r\nand peace.\r\n\r\n“I make them carry me like the relics of a saint,” wrote the King after\r\nthe first day’s journey. Though sleepless and crippled, he concocted\r\ndaily bulletins to Prince Henry in the spirit of a schoolboy. Since it\r\nhad been noised abroad that Daun had received the papal benediction\r\nhe had more than ever been the butt of Frederick’s jests. Now, to\r\ncreate “a favourable impression on the mind of the blessed creature and\r\nhis council,” he bids his brother announce his little escort as 4000\r\nstrong, and sends a list of the regiments of which it may be said to\r\nconsist. “Daun and his Austrians shall not perceive that I have the\r\ngout,” he boasted.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, on November 14th, he took over the command. Pleased\r\nthat Daun paid him the compliment of retreating, he ordered Finck\r\nto pursue. All the general’s objections were overruled, and he took\r\nrefuge in wooden obedience to the letter of the King’s orders. “In a\r\nfew days,” Frederick wrote on the 17th, “we shall reap the fruit of\r\nthis disposition.” In four the royal prophecy was fulfilled, but the\r\nharvester was Daun. Finck’s command, some 15,000 strong, with seventy\r\nguns, was entangled in the hills south of Dresden. Believing themselves\r\nto be surrounded by thrice their number, the Prussians laid down their\r\narms at Maxen (November 21, 1759).\r\n\r\nThe blow was more crushing than Kunersdorf, for the whisper now sped\r\nthrough the world that the Prussians were turning cowards. Eichel\r\nconfessed that his heart was so full of bitterness and chagrin that\r\nit was quite out of his power that day to write anything in cipher.\r\nThe King, who had boasted to Voltaire that he would despatch his next\r\nletter from Dresden, complained bitterly that ill-luck pursued him all\r\nhis days. He strove to atone for his over-confidence by exertion, and\r\nfor many weeks kept the field, defying the stern winter. He thereby\r\naverted an Austrian reconquest of Saxony, but the gates of Dresden\r\nnever opened to him again. The Prussian cause and the Prussian King,\r\nthought the world, were failing together. “If you saw me, you would\r\nscarcely know me again,” Frederick wrote to Voltaire. “I am old,\r\nbroken, grayheaded, wrinkled. I am losing my teeth and my gaiety.”\r\nYet this dejected veteran alone kept together the Prussian army. That\r\narmy was the sole bulwark of the State. If Frederick had in truth lost\r\nhealth, skill, and fortune, what hope was left to Prussia?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE SEVEN YEARS’ WAR (1760–1763)\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the spring of 1760, when the weary Frederick braced himself\r\nto grapple anew with a task which four campaigns seemed only to\r\nhave increased, and the moment when a sudden stroke of fortune was\r\nto give him rest, there intervenes a gap of time as great as that\r\nwhich separates his first plunge into the war from his overthrow at\r\nKunersdorf. If we are compelled to be content with a swift review of\r\nthese final phases of the struggle, we must by no means lose from sight\r\nthe tenacity and adroitness of the hero upon whom every campaign laid\r\na heavier burden than the last, and to whom every year seemed endless.\r\nAfter Kunersdorf and Maxen, we, who know that Frederick and Prussia did\r\nnot perish, may be impatient to have done with their long agony. But\r\nFrederick himself enjoyed no such comfortable prescience. Hopes he had\r\nindeed in plenty. Denmark might join him, the Tartars might rise, the\r\nTurks, he was constantly assured, were on the very verge of attacking\r\nAustria. Now the French, now the Russians, he believed, were about to\r\ndesert the coalition against him. The event testified to his courage\r\nrather than to his insight. Time brought only fresh disappointments and\r\nprospects ever more black, but the King neither flinched nor paused.\r\nUnder the bludgeonings of chance his head was bloody but unbowed. “It\r\nwas not the army,” said Napoleon, “that defended Prussia, seven years\r\nthrough, against the three greatest Powers of Europe, it was Frederick\r\nthe Great.”\r\n\r\nTill near its close the campaign of 1760 seemed to be merely the\r\nnatural sequel to that of 1759. In spite of all the chances of high\r\npolitics, the same combatants took the field on either side. France,\r\nbeaten by land and sea, had tempted England with the offer of a\r\nseparate peace. But Pitt displayed anew the loyalty to his ally which\r\nwas the consolation of Frederick’s darkest hours. The English minister\r\nrecognised that his country’s triumphs over France off Lagos, in\r\nthe bay of Quiberon, and before the walls of Quebec in the glorious\r\ncampaign of 1759, had been due to the Prussian alliance almost as\r\ndirectly as the victory of Minden. He braved the taunt that he was more\r\nPrussian than the King of Prussia and inflexibly refused to desert him\r\nin his hour of misfortune. The Russians, on the other hand, consented\r\nto serve Maria Theresa anew, but at a high price. Ost-Preussen, which\r\nthey had conquered, was to be theirs for ever. Thus the Hapsburg,\r\nthough guardian and head of Germany, was compelled to promise that if\r\nPrussia were crushed the Muscovite should advance to the Vistula.\r\n\r\nThe labours of the diplomatists, from which Frederick looked for great\r\ngains, had done nothing to change the military situation in his favour.\r\nThe campaign of 1760 saw once more Ferdinand confronting the French in\r\nthe West, the Swedes paralysed by their own incompetence in Pomerania,\r\nDaun striving to reconquer Saxony, Laudon striving to reconquer\r\nSilesia, and the Russians, as usual, advancing towards the Oder. But,\r\nwhereas in 1759 Frederick’s own presence had more than once caused\r\ndisaster to his armies, in 1760 he became again the hero of the strife.\r\nHe was always most formidable when the odds against him were heavy, and\r\nin 1760 none could doubt that the Prussians were at an overwhelming\r\ndisadvantage. Even the King regarded the campaign as a gambler’s last\r\nthrow. Failing extraordinary good fortune, he predicted the collapse of\r\nPrussia before the autumn.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the war the enemy began a campaign on Prussian\r\nsoil. Laudon invaded Silesia, and the King’s friend, Fouqué, believing\r\nhimself too weak to hold Landshut, fell back on Breslau. The Silesians\r\nprotested that they were being abandoned to the mercy of the enemy and\r\nFrederick complained that his generals did more mischief to him than\r\nto the enemy. Under-estimating Laudon’s talent for war, he ordered\r\nFouqué to recover Landshut at once, and promised to come to the rescue\r\nin person as soon as he had beaten the enemy in Saxony. Fouqué obeyed,\r\nbut in Laudon he had an opponent far more active than Daun. His force\r\nof less than 11,000 men was soon in as hopeless a plight as that of\r\nFinck at Maxen. He, too, avenged the insults of the King by following\r\nhis orders to the letter, for the more considerate counter-orders\r\nwhich Frederick despatched never reached him. On June 23, 1760, near\r\nLandshut, the Prussians maintained a hopeless struggle for seven hours.\r\nIt is believed that the killed and wounded numbered more than 5000\r\nmen. It is certain that only some 1500 cavalry, perhaps one-seventh of\r\nFouqué’s whole force, succeeded in cutting their way through the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt Landshut the Prussian regiments regained by their valour the repute\r\nwhich they had lost at Maxen, where they laid down their arms without\r\na blow. But the fruits of Laudon’s victory were great. Silesia now lay\r\ndefenceless before the Austrians, and only Prince Henry’s weak force\r\nscreened it from the advancing Russians. Frederick, though balked of\r\na battle, was compelled to leave his work in Saxony undone and to\r\ntransfer the bulk of the Prussian army to the eastern theatre of war.\r\nHis going was a proof of weakness, but the manner of it paid a signal\r\ntribute to his fame. None dared to stand in his way. The Austrians\r\nunder Lacy were so determined to be on the safe side that they left\r\nDresden bare, and Frederick was tempted by the opportunity of a\r\nbrilliant triumph to turn aside.\r\n\r\nHe hoped to take the Saxon capital in two or three days, but the\r\ndefenders were stout-hearted beyond his calculation. After he had\r\nwasted more than a fortnight before the walls, the news that Glatz\r\nhad fallen and that Breslau was in danger compelled him to resume\r\nthe dreary tramp towards Silesia. His prestige and his position had\r\nsuffered alike, and his mood was more dejected than ever. Philosophy,\r\nhe professed, was his only consolation. Since nothing worse could\r\nhappen to him than what he looked for, he could have no occasion for\r\ndisappointment. He was determined to hold fast to duty during the brief\r\nspace that might still separate him from the abyss. It was no great\r\nmatter, he told Finckenstein, whether they were crushed a month sooner\r\nor a month later. The death of his old servant, Podewils, affected him\r\nlittle, for it seemed but a small item in the general ruin of the State.\r\n\r\nThus began the month of August, 1760, in which Frederick and his army\r\ndispelled by their own valiant deeds some of the darkest clouds that\r\nhung over Prussia. They were escorted into Silesia, where Soltykoff’s\r\nRussians and Laudon’s Austrians awaited them, by the armies of Daun and\r\nLacy, which marched, said the King, like the vanguard and rear-guard\r\nof their own force. Thanks to the stout-heartedness of the Prussian\r\ngeneral Tauentzien, Laudon had summoned Breslau in vain. Now, however,\r\nhe effected a junction with Daun, and the united Austrian forces\r\noutnumbered Frederick by three to one.\r\n\r\nAt no moment of his long career, not even when he galloped from the\r\nfield of Mollwitz nor when he gathered round him the wreckage after\r\nKunersdorf, had the King’s plight seemed so desperate as now. He\r\nhimself upon whom all depended was in the depths of dejection. He had\r\nwith him only some 30,000 men, and Kay, Kunersdorf, Maxen, Landshut,\r\nDresden formed an unbroken series of disasters. Against him were some\r\n90,000 Austrians, commanded by Daun, to whom his royal mistress had\r\nsent the most unequivocal instructions to fight, and by Laudon, to\r\nwhom military instinct no less clearly dictated battle. They barred\r\nFrederick’s path both to Breslau and to Schweidnitz, and brought his\r\nforce to the verge of starvation. Across the Oder the Russians were\r\nmasters of the land, waiting only for the tidings of victory to pour\r\na new host over bridges which they had already built. To retreat was\r\nto abandon Silesia, to stand still was to be starved or crushed,\r\nto attack was beyond the imagination even of a Frederick. Prussian\r\nofficers talked of a new and greater Maxen, and the British ambassador,\r\nMitchell, burned his papers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF LIEGNITZ, AUGUST 15, 1760.]\r\n\r\nAt last Frederick moved. Having learned from a drunken deserter that\r\nDaun was planning a surprise, he resolved to march towards the Oder,\r\npreferring the neighbourhood of the Russians on the right bank to a\r\nsituation which had plainly become untenable. On the evening of August\r\n14, 1760, the Prussians stole away from their camp and occupied a\r\nstrong position to the north-east of Liegnitz. On the western side,\r\nwhere Daun’s attack might be looked for, the ground was admirable for\r\ndefence. Behind the stream of the Schwarzwasser rises a steep and\r\nsudden bank, shaped like a natural bastion. This was manned by the\r\nright wing, encamped on a champaign so level that it forms the Liegnitz\r\ndrill-ground to this day. Further north-east a gentle slope descended\r\nfrom the lines of the Prussian left to the little village of Panten and\r\nso to the river Katzbach. There through the moonlit night the men\r\nlay under arms, forbidden to cheer themselves with song, but filled\r\nwith an expectancy that banished sleep. The King, who shared all their\r\nprivations, wrapped himself in his cloak and snatched a brief rest by a\r\nwatch-fire after satisfying himself that all was ordered aright.\r\n\r\nTill dawn the stillness was unbroken. Then in a moment blazed up one of\r\nthe shortest and most brilliant fights of the whole war. A breathless\r\nmessenger cried that the enemy—Laudon—was attacking in force on the\r\nextreme left. Frederick hurried off to oppose him. Had the attack been\r\nmade fifteen minutes earlier, he declared, the issue would have been\r\nfar different. But the Prussians profited much by their stealthy change\r\nof camp. Laudon’s march was a part of Daun’s concerted attack upon\r\nthe position that they had quitted seven hours before. The result of\r\ntheir movement was that Daun hardly reached them, while Laudon, who\r\nexpected to surprise their baggage, was himself surprised. Marching\r\nwithout a vanguard, he found himself committed to an uphill fight\r\nwithout support from Daun. None the less he attacked with such swing\r\nand dash that the Prussian left was well-nigh cut in two, It was saved\r\nby the infantry, who first valiantly held Panten and then set it on\r\nfire. This checked the Austrian advance and enabled the Prussians to\r\nmake good use of their position. About an hour and a half after the\r\nfirst onset Laudon retired across the Katzbach unpursued. The Prussians\r\nclaimed to have killed or wounded 6000 men and captured 4000—a total\r\nloss thrice as great as their own. They had thus annihilated nearly\r\none-third of Laudon’s force, and—what was even more important—they had\r\nrent the net that was closing round them. Daun had appeared in sight\r\nof the Prussians only to learn of Laudon’s disaster and to retire.\r\nHenceforward it was beyond the power of the Empress to induce her\r\nfavoured field-marshal to attack.\r\n\r\nThe moral gain was perhaps the greatest of all the advantages that\r\nFrederick derived from Liegnitz. “A second edition of Rossbach,” as\r\nhe called the battle, was the best proof that Prussian valour and\r\nleadership and luck had none of them vanished from the earth. The King,\r\nwho had his coat torn by one ball and his horse wounded by another,\r\nascribed the victory to the favour of fortune and the bravery of his\r\nmen. No other judge, whether Prussian, Austrian, or Russian, could fail\r\nto ascribe a great share in it to the King. The value of this renewal\r\nof prestige was apparent almost every day that the war had yet to\r\nrun. However huge the masses of Austrians and Russians might be, they\r\nwere usually content to watch Frederick at a respectful distance. The\r\ninitiative was thus often abandoned to the weaker side and the value of\r\nFrederick’s army enhanced threefold.\r\n\r\nYet nothing could demonstrate more clearly than their movements after\r\nLiegnitz how weak the Prussians were. Frederick’s departure from the\r\nfield of victory was in truth a flight, but a flight which covered the\r\nfugitives with glory. Young Lieutenant Archenholtz, who was among the\r\nvictors, tells the astounding tale of how\r\n\r\n    “this army, spent with bloody toil and girt by mighty hosts,\r\n    must press on without rest and without delay, and yet must\r\n    bear with it every gun and man that had been taken and all the\r\n    wounded as well. These last were packed into meal-wagons and\r\n    bread-wagons, into carriages and carts, no matter whose they\r\n    might be. Even the King gave up his. King and generals gave up\r\n    their led horses to carry the wounded who could ride. The empty\r\n    meal-wagons were broken up and their horses harnessed to the\r\n    captured guns. Every horseman and driver must take with him one\r\n    of the enemy’s muskets. Nothing was left behind, not a single\r\n    wounded man, Prussian or Austrian, and at nine o’clock, four\r\n    hours after the end of the battle, the army with its enormous\r\n    load was in full march.”\r\n\r\nTwelve good miles were covered that day under the August sun. Frederick\r\nwas still between two armies, each larger than his own. Neither\r\nRussians nor Austrians, however, dared attack him and he joined Prince\r\nHenry at Breslau without another stroke of sword.\r\n\r\nOf his brother Henry, Frederick said at a later date, “There is but\r\none of us that never made a mistake in war.” But the King continually\r\nrejected his counsel, though the event proved it to have been wise,\r\nand his relations with the Prince often became strained. A brilliant\r\nstrategist, Henry wished to husband Prussian powder and Prussian blood\r\nby manœuvring more and fighting less. The victor of Leuthen, on the\r\nother hand, was ready to take great risks if he believed that his\r\nsuccess would be fatal to the chief army either of the Russians or of\r\nthe Austrians. “If you engage in small affairs only,” he maintained,\r\n“you will always remain mediocre, but if you engage in ten great\r\nundertakings and are lucky in no more than two you make your name\r\nimmortal.”\r\n\r\nFrederick’s habitual inclination to throw for high stakes was increased\r\nby the events of September and October, 1760. His task was to guard\r\nthe Silesian fortresses against Daun, but while he—like the court of\r\nVienna—yearned for a decisive action Berlin fell into the hands of\r\n40,000 Russians and Austrians. The raiders occupied the city for four\r\ndays and exacted a contribution of two million thalers, but the rumour\r\nof the King’s approach sufficed to drive them off. Winter was drawing\r\nnigh and the Russians vanished as was their wont. There was thus less\r\nneed to fear for Silesia, but the enemy still held Saxony, and Saxony\r\nwas to Frederick a recruiting-ground, a treasure-house, and a home.\r\nWith added reasons for a battle, but with little assurance of success,\r\nhe therefore transferred thither the seat of war.\r\n\r\n    “The close of my days is poisoned,” he wrote, “and the evening\r\n    of my life as hideous as its morning. Never will I endure the\r\n    moment that must force me to make a dishonourable peace. No\r\n    persuasion, no eloquence can bring me to sign my shame. Either\r\n    I will bury myself under the ruins of my fatherland, or if this\r\n    consolation seem too sweet to the Misfortune that pursues me, I\r\n    will myself put an end to my woes.... After having sacrificed\r\n    my youth to my Father, and my ripe years to my fatherland, I\r\n    think I have acquired the right to dispose of my old age as\r\n    I please.... And so I will finish this campaign, resolved to\r\n    hazard all and to try the most desperate measures, to conquer\r\n    or to find a glorious end.”\r\n\r\nWe who have seen Frederick resign his crown after Kunersdorf are free\r\nto believe that he would have taken his life after a new Kolin. His\r\nwords are in any event highly significant of the view which he took\r\nof the limits of his duty to the State, whose course he had steered\r\naccording to his own will for twenty years. Five days after they were\r\nwritten, on November 3, 1760, he did in truth hazard all, and try the\r\nmost desperate measures. Daun, who had followed him into Saxony, was\r\nencamped near Torgau in a position reputed impregnable. He had 50,000\r\nmen with an enormous park of artillery, and whatever his shortcomings\r\nin attack, none could impugn his talent for defence. Yet Frederick,\r\nwith 44,000 men, determined to attack, and to attack by one of the most\r\ndifficult operations in war, a simultaneous onslaught on opposite sides\r\nof the enemy’s position. The King himself proposed to lead half the\r\narmy through the forest, right round the Austrian camp, so as to assail\r\nit from the north. The other half was to attack from the south under\r\nZieten, the bravest of hussars but the youngest of generals, who had\r\ncommanded a wing at Liegnitz, but had never handled an army, and who\r\ndid not know the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly surprising, with such a plan as this, that Torgau, like\r\nmany battles, was fought not as was designed but as best it might\r\nbe. The history of the day proved beyond dispute that Frederick had\r\nventured much. The weather, their own errors, and the enemy’s guns\r\nruined the Prussian simultaneous attack. The King’s contingent fought\r\na desperate battle. Few of his attendants escaped without a wound. His\r\nown life was saved as if by miracle. Three horses were killed under\r\nhim. A spent ball struck him senseless, but his pelisse saved him from\r\nserious hurt. He rallied both himself and his men, but when evening\r\ncame the Austrians had the advantage. Daun felt that he might safely\r\nleave the field to dress a wound and send news of victory to Vienna.\r\n\r\nThen, in the last hour of the fight, something like a simultaneous\r\nattack was carried out and it succeeded. After long indecision, Zieten\r\nstormed the southern heights with desperate courage and the confused\r\nstruggle was taken up a third time by the King’s forces on the north.\r\nBy eight o’clock, thirteen hours after the Prussians had left camp,\r\nthe Austrian resistance was at an end. Ere midnight Daun was fleeing\r\nacross the Elbe, while Frederick, seated on the altar-step of a village\r\nchurch, scribbled a note to Finckenstein, promising to send details of\r\nthe victory next day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF TORGAU, NOVEMBER 3, 1760.]\r\n\r\nBefore dawn, he was once more among his troops riding through the\r\nlines and embracing Zieten. At Torgau he had frustrated the Austrian\r\nreconquest of Saxony and reduced their forces by some 16,000 men.\r\nBut when his own loss came to be counted he strictly forbade his\r\nadjutants to reveal the sum. Torgau was the bloodiest battle of the\r\nwar and the Prussians had suffered most. Their casualties exceeded by\r\nnearly one thousand those of the beaten side.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Liegnitz and Torgau the campaign of 1760 seemed to have\r\nchanged Frederick’s situation but little. Dresden was still beyond\r\nhis reach, but he was able to spend a pleasant winter at Leipzig,\r\nsurrounded by books and men of letters. Diplomacy, as before, promised\r\nmuch and performed little, but drilling and recruiting went on without\r\npause. Although the quality of the Prussian army could not but\r\ndeteriorate, the numbers were astonishingly maintained. Commissions\r\nwere given to mere lads, freebooters were welcomed, and the lands of\r\nthe lesser German princes were scoured for men, till in the spring\r\nof 1761 a hundred thousand soldiers were ready to take the field. To\r\nfurnish the necessary funds no new taxes were laid upon the Prussians,\r\nbut Frederick issued great quantities of base coin and Saxony, where\r\nthe Austrians might otherwise have found support, was harried to the\r\nverge of devastation.\r\n\r\nIt was believed at Vienna that Frederick would resort to his plan of\r\nthe preceding year by pitting himself against the army which covered\r\nDresden. The Empress therefore implored Daun once more to take command.\r\nHe consented, but only on the astounding condition that he should not\r\nbe expected to make conquests. Then the King of Prussia transferred\r\nhimself to Silesia, which became the principal scene of the events of\r\n1761, perhaps the dreariest of all campaigns.\r\n\r\nFor the third year in succession it was beyond the power of the\r\nPrussians to prevent the armies of the Empress and Czarina from\r\njoining hands in Silesia. The King would have risked a battle against\r\neither, but battle was not vouchsafed him. Yet in face of an enemy\r\nwho outnumbered his 55,000 men by more than two to one he had still\r\na weapon at his disposal and it proved effectual. The bold offensive\r\nof his earlier campaigns had perforce given place to defensive action\r\nonly. Although Ferdinand still gloriously held his own against\r\nthe French, Frederick knew that he himself was too weak to meet\r\nthe combined Austrian and Russian army in the field. He therefore\r\nentrenched himself and defied the allies either to destroy him where he\r\nstood or to make lasting conquests while his army remained undestroyed.\r\n\r\nFor five weeks, till near the end of September, he thus inhabited the\r\nfamous camp of Bunzelwitz, resting upon Schweidnitz, the key of Lower\r\nSilesia. Then, deeming the danger past, he moved southward to seek\r\nfresh supplies. His absence woke the foe to life and the campaign\r\nclosed with disaster. On October 1, 1761, Laudon astonished Europe by\r\nstorming Schweidnitz. A second reverse followed. Before the year was\r\nout the Russians were masters of Colberg, the Baltic gate of Prussian\r\nPomerania. For the first time, therefore, the armies of the enemy could\r\nwinter on Prussian soil. A huge crescent of foes, French, Imperialists,\r\nAustrians, Russians, Swedes, was at last enfolding Prussia. When\r\nspring came would they not surely stifle her?\r\n\r\nFrederick, moping through the winter at Breslau, declared once more\r\nthat Fortune alone could save him. He likened himself to a fiddler from\r\nwhose instrument men tore away the strings one by one till all were\r\ngone and still demanded music. Once more he declared that philosophy\r\nalone could console him in his “pilgrimage through this hell called the\r\nworld.” “I save myself,” he wrote, “by viewing the world as though from\r\na distant planet. Then everything seems infinitely small, and I pity\r\nmy enemies for giving themselves so much trouble about such a trifle.”\r\nYet he never ceased to recruit, to drill, and to make plans for the\r\nglorious offensive campaign that he hoped to engage in with the aid of\r\nthe Tartars and the Turks.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1761, he professed indifference to the course of events in\r\nEngland, though two months earlier his champion Pitt had given place\r\nto men who preferred the Austrian alliance to the Prussian, and who\r\ndesired that separate peace with France which Pitt had rejected in\r\n1758. The treaty then made between England and Prussia forbade either\r\nto make peace without the other till April 11th of the following year.\r\nIn 1759, 1760, and 1761 this compact had been renewed. Now, however,\r\nNewcastle and Bute began to clamour for what Pitt had ventured only\r\nto suggest—that Frederick should purchase peace by some concession\r\nconformable to the course of the Continental war. The Prussian envoys\r\nin London dared to advise their sovereign to comply. He answered that\r\nthey were in nowise permitted to give him such foolish and impertinent\r\ncounsel. “Your father,” he wrote to one of them, though the charge was\r\nbaseless, “took bribes from France and England; has he bequeathed the\r\nhabit to you?”\r\n\r\nFrederick’s inflexible resolve to make no concession was by no means\r\nthe same as a resolve to make no bargain. He often played with the\r\nfancy that Saxony or a part of it might be left in his hands at the\r\npeace. For this he would gladly surrender any or all of his outlying\r\nprovinces. But he would rather forfeit the English subsidy and\r\njeopardise the very existence of the Prussian State than sue for the\r\npeace which Kaunitz was more than willing to conclude on terms of\r\nmoderate profit for the allies. Two weighty reasons of policy increased\r\nhis determination. The labours of the winter once again filled the\r\nranks and the war-chest of Prussia. And Fortune, of whom the King said\r\nthat she alone could extricate him, now gave with one hand more than\r\nshe took away with the other. At the moment when England left him,\r\nRussia ranged herself at his side.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this marvellous revolution was the accident that the\r\nCzarina died early in January, 1762, and that her nephew and successor,\r\nPeter III., was a worshipper of the King of Prussia. Elizabeth had\r\nlived in debauchery and left upwards of 15,000 dresses to bear witness\r\nto her luxurious tastes. It is possible that her chief motive in\r\nattacking Frederick was a desire to chastise the man who had spoken\r\nill of her. But there can be no doubt that her policy was suited to the\r\ninterests of the State. It was argued at a later date that her alliance\r\nwith the Queen had cost Russia countless lives and sixty millions of\r\nmoney. But in 1762 it had already procured Ost-Preussen and part of\r\nPomerania, and there seemed to be good hope that Prussia, the only\r\nPower which could prevent a vast extension of Russian influence in\r\nPoland, would be permanently crippled. If the allies dared not attack\r\nthe King of Prussia, they were at least in a fair way to exhaust his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, however, the rash young Holsteiner who now wielded the\r\nsceptre of his great namesake, Peter, flung away all that his troops\r\nhad purchased with their blood in five campaigns—at Gross-Jägersdorf,\r\nZorndorf, Kay, Kunersdorf, and Colberg. In the first hours of his\r\nreign he ordered his army to take no step in advance. Before January\r\nwas over, Frederick knew that peace with Russia was assured. The\r\nCzar’s one desire seemed to be to gratify his brother of Prussia. He\r\ncraved investiture with the order of the Black Eagle, and declared\r\nthat he would stand by while Turks and Tartars attacked the Austrian\r\ndominions. He resigned the Russian conquests without indemnity,\r\nundertook to promote peace with Sweden, and even offered Frederick his\r\nalliance. Influenced by his withdrawal, the Swedes came to terms of\r\ntheir own accord and concluded the Peace of Hamburg (May 22, 1762),\r\nwhich re-established the conditions of 1720. Frederick could therefore\r\nface the remnants of the coalition without anxiety for his rear. From\r\nOst-Preussen he now drew 15,000 men. By undertaking to assist Peter in\r\nhis schemes for winning back the lands which the House of Holstein had\r\nlost to Denmark forty years before, he secured the immediate help of\r\n20,000 Russians.\r\n\r\nThe situation was so completely transformed since the days when\r\nFrederick lay motionless at Bunzelwitz that in 1762 he determined\r\nonce more to take the aggressive. His first aim must be the recovery\r\nof Schweidnitz. This could only be accomplished by inducing Daun to\r\ngive battle, for his army, which had encamped near the fortress, was\r\nnow playing the part that had fallen to the Prussians in the previous\r\nyear. While the manœuvres were pursuing their tedious course the news\r\narrived that Peter III. had been deposed. His wife, the German princess\r\nCatherine II., who was thus placed in power, at once recalled the\r\n20,000 Russians from Silesia. Frederick, however, calculating on the\r\ninfluence which their presence would exercise upon the mind of Daun,\r\npersuaded their commander to conceal the order and to remain a few days\r\nlonger as a spectator of the war. Then on July 21, 1762, the Prussians\r\nsurprised Daun’s right wing and gained a clever victory at Burkersdorf.\r\nAt a sacrifice of some 1600 men they reduced the enemy’s force by\r\nnearly 10,000, and the retreat of the Austrians enabled them to begin\r\nthe siege of Schweidnitz.\r\n\r\nThenceforward it was plain that the dragging war would lead to no\r\ndecisive issue. Frederick was so sure of his cause that he had\r\nalready sent a commissioner to examine the civil needs of Pomerania.\r\nBut he could only undertake formidable aggressive movements if the\r\nTurks and Tartars rose, and once again they disappointed his hopes.\r\nInstead of new combatants joining in the fray the old ones were\r\nquitting it. Bute was eager to take the step which Pitt had scorned to\r\ntake in 1760. Before the year was out France and England signed the\r\npreliminaries which were embodied in the Peace of Paris in February,\r\n1763. Immediately after Burkersdorf, the Russians withdrew and it was\r\nnot to be expected that the Austrians and Imperialists could accomplish\r\nby themselves a task which had baffled the unbroken coalition. Daun,\r\nindeed, attempted to avenge Burkersdorf by a counter-surprise. He\r\nfailed and in October, 1762, Schweidnitz fell. Before the month was\r\nover Prince Henry, who was conducting the campaign in Saxony, gained\r\na great victory over the Imperialist army at Freiberg. The campaign\r\nclosed with an armistice between Frederick and the Austrians and a\r\nseries of Prussian forays against the hostile princes of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAt last the Queen realised that she had failed. She promptly determined\r\nnot to prolong a struggle which could only add to the misery of\r\nmankind. So vast a legacy of hate had, however, been left by the war\r\nthat it was difficult to find a single Power whose good offices both\r\nsides could accept with a view to peace. The Queen therefore brought\r\nherself to approach “the wicked man” direct and sent an envoy to\r\nthe King of Prussia. For nearly seven weeks negotiations went on at\r\nHubertusburg, a castle of the unfortunate Saxon monarch. Frederick\r\nshowed himself pliant in matters of etiquette and unbending where any\r\npractical advantage was at stake. He was willing to gratify Hapsburg\r\npride by sending his envoy more than half-way to meet the envoy of the\r\nQueen, by allowing her name to precede his in the documents, and by\r\npromising to further the election of her son Joseph as Emperor. But\r\nhe insisted on the restoration of Glatz by the Austrians, and on the\r\npayment by the Saxons of his grinding taxes up to the very eve of peace.\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 1763, the Peace of Hubertusburg was signed. After seven\r\ncampaigns and an incalculable loss of blood and treasure, Austria and\r\nPrussia agreed to return to their situation before the outbreak of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFREDERICK AND PRUSSIA AFTER THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe monarch who had borne the burden of seven campaigns—a burden of\r\nwhich his ten great battles formed but a trifling fraction—might well\r\nhave been pardoned for appropriating to himself some share in the\r\nrepose which his labours had won for Prussia. Even if it is difficult\r\nto couple the thought of Frederick with that of repose, it might at\r\nleast be expected that after a triumph of defence hardly surpassed in\r\nhuman history he would delight his army by praising their achievements\r\nand his people by accepting their plaudits. Relaxation for himself\r\nand courtesy towards others were, however, equally distasteful to the\r\nKing. He slunk into his capital by back streets and thus frustrated\r\nthe preparations of the citizens to express their loyalty and joy. Yet\r\nin the darkest moments of the war he had been devising plans for the\r\nimprovement of Prussia and he hardly waited for the peace to be signed\r\nbefore plunging into a rapid career of reform. After Kunersdorf, while\r\nhis despair was gradually giving place to hope and hope to confidence,\r\nhe was not too absorbed in strategy to lay to heart the defects which\r\nhe observed in the schooling of the peasants near the Spree. The weeks\r\nwhich passed while his envoy at Hubertusburg was harvesting the fruits\r\nof the war were spent by Frederick in planning reforms for the army\r\nwhich had proved its matchless quality through all the seven campaigns.\r\n\r\nHis first desire was to get rid of those helpers whose services he had\r\naccepted only because of pressing need. Twenty-one free battalions had\r\nbeen raised and had proved immensely serviceable. Now the King bade\r\ntwo-thirds of them go their ways without reward. His learned friend and\r\nservant, Colonel Guichard, upon whom in consequence of a dispute about\r\nthe battle of Pharsalia he had inflicted the name Quintus Icilius,\r\nappealed to him to repay to his officers part at least of the money\r\nwhich they had spent from their own pockets in enlisting their men.\r\n“Thy officers have stolen like ravens,” replied the King; “they shall\r\nnot have a farthing.” Still more ungenerous was his treatment of a\r\nsection of his army whose only fault was their lack of noble birth.\r\nDuring the long war many students and schoolboys of the citizen class\r\nentered the army as volunteers and received commissions. In the hour of\r\ntriumph they were ruthlessly sacrificed to Frederick’s principle that\r\nhis officers, save perhaps among the garrison regiments, must belong to\r\nthe caste of nobles. Prussians who had served him in his extremity must\r\nsubmit to be cashiered, while foreigners of rank were enlisted to atone\r\nfor the dearth of natives whose pedigrees satisfied his requirements.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the army as a whole was wounded by harsh criticism\r\nand harsh reforms. This, like much of Frederick’s conduct, may be\r\nascribed to the contempt for mankind which experience only increased,\r\nand to the almost inevitable effect upon himself of the unbridled\r\nabsolutism described in the sixth chapter of this book. “Dogs, would\r\nye live for ever?” he shrieked at his men in the crisis of one of his\r\nfights. He was forced to confess that, as his strength became less and\r\nthe number of his subjects greater, he could not hope to look into all\r\naffairs of government with his own eyes. Yet he shrank more and more\r\nfrom creating an official or a system in anywise independent of his own\r\nimmediate control. In 1763 he therefore appointed inspectors of cavalry\r\nand of infantry in every province and endowed them with wide powers of\r\nsupervision of the officers and all that they did. This measure, it\r\nneed hardly be said, roused the utmost bitterness among the regimental\r\nstaff, which had hitherto enjoyed a great measure of independence on\r\nthe sole condition that the King was satisfied with the results of\r\nits work. It was the more distasteful for the very reason which made\r\nit acceptable to Frederick—that the new inspectors were appointed at\r\nthe royal pleasure without regard to seniority. The chief officer of\r\na regiment, who had been wont to rule it like a patriarch, was now\r\nsubjected to the control of a rival, perhaps his junior, who did not\r\nresign his own command and could favour it as he pleased.\r\n\r\nThe captains, too, suffered in pocket from another unpopular reform.\r\nThey had hitherto received from the treasury the full wages of every\r\nman on the muster-roll of their company. In time of peace, however,\r\nthe native-born soldiers spent nine or ten months of the year on\r\nfurlough without pay. Each captain defrayed the cost of recruiting\r\nforeigners for his company out of what he received and pocketed the\r\nbalance. Now, at the moment when war ceased, Frederick cut off this\r\nsource of income. By retaining regiments of special merit on the old\r\nfooting he insulted the rest, and by graduating according to his\r\nopinion of the regiment’s efficiency the trifling allowances paid by\r\nway of compensation he cast a slur upon the professional honour of\r\nofficers and men alike. The King paid his officers ten thalers a month\r\nand their pensions depended entirely upon his caprice. Many captains\r\nwere thenceforward unable to resist the temptation to falsify the\r\nmuster-rolls so as to receive pay for soldiers who did not exist.\r\n\r\nThe King’s despotic power, however, enabled him to make light of\r\nmilitary discontent in time of peace. He resolved to keep up an army\r\nof 150,000 men, to drill it as it had never been drilled before, to\r\neducate the officers, to review all the troops every year, to build new\r\nfortresses, and to establish stores of money and munitions sufficient\r\nto enable Prussia to enter at a moment’s notice upon a war of eight\r\ncampaigns. It is a highly significant fact that in Frederick’s secret\r\nestimates for the future struggle the annual contribution of Prussia\r\nwas set down at 4,700,000 thalers and the sum to be extorted from\r\nSaxony at 5,000,000. The balance of the 12,000,000 thalers, which\r\nwas the price of a campaign, must come from the royal accumulations.\r\nFrederick’s own expenses were only 220,000 thalers a year. At the\r\nclose of his reign, when the total revenue of the State was not quite\r\n22,000,000 thalers, the treasure amounted to more than 51,000,000, a\r\nsum fully five times as great as that which he had inherited from his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nFrederick was compelled by his past to stand to arms all his life\r\nthrough. With advancing years he became more lonely and more subject\r\nto disease. In 1765 he lost his sister, the Margravine of Schwedt,\r\nand next year the aged Madame de Camas, whom he always called Mamma.\r\nHis old friends died one by one and the French wits had vanished. His\r\nbrothers, Henry and Ferdinand, were often estranged from him by his\r\nbitter words. Yet to the end of his life he prided himself on his\r\ncheerfulness between the attacks of gout and he permitted no disease to\r\ninterrupt his labours. These were devoted first, as we have seen, to\r\nmaking the land secure from attack by means of the army, and also to\r\nguarding it from famine by methods which may next be considered. Close\r\non the heels of these essential duties came tasks of fresh development\r\nand reform, the acquisition of West-Preussen in 1772, and new\r\nendeavours to uphold Prussian prestige against the House of Hapsburg.\r\n\r\nIt is of course impossible to calculate exactly the damage which a\r\ncountry suffers in time of war. Moral gains and losses count in the\r\nlong run for more than material, and no statistics even of material\r\nlosses are truly satisfactory. As between one Prussian province and\r\nanother, however, a rough comparison may be made by means of the growth\r\nor decline of the population. Silesia and the lands east of the Oder\r\nhad naturally suffered most, since, in addition to their quota of\r\nsoldiers slain, they had long endured the presence of invading armies.\r\nIn Silesia the numbers fell by 50,000, about one in twenty-three, but\r\nfurther north, in the districts in which the Russians had encamped, the\r\nproportion was nearly five times as heavy. Frederick’s own estimate was\r\nthat one-ninth of his subjects had perished.\r\n\r\nThe loss of property had undoubtedly been very great. The conscience\r\nof the age forbade massacre, but was lenient towards pillage and\r\ndevastation. But the King surpassed himself by what Carlyle terms “the\r\ninstantaneous practical alacrity with which he set about repairing that\r\nimmense miscellany of ruin.” So far as the material losses sustained\r\nby individual Prussians could be ascertained, they were set down by\r\nthe careful hands of royal commissioners and mitigated by royal gifts.\r\nThe King had at his disposal depreciated coin to the amount of nearly\r\n30,000,000 thalers, the sum which had been accumulated to pay for the\r\neighth and ninth campaigns. This more than sufficed for the needs of\r\nthe army and the repayment of the trifling loans, less than five and a\r\nhalf million thalers in all, that Frederick had contracted during the\r\nwar. With the residue and with the surplus revenues of the State the\r\nKing set to work to prevent a single one of his subjects from falling\r\ninto absolute ruin. His doles were graduated not by any standard of\r\nabstract justice, but by the rule that the minimum amount of help\r\nshould be given that would serve the purpose of the State. Many towns\r\nhad paid ransoms to the enemy to avoid being sacked. That of Berlin,\r\ntwo million thalers, was repaid out of the treasury, but Halle received\r\nless than one-sixth of what it claimed, and in the majority of cases\r\nthe burghers were left to bear the loss themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the country districts, however, there was less power of recuperation\r\nthan among the comparatively wealthy towns. According to Frederick’s\r\nopinion, it was therefore necessary that the State should make it\r\npossible for nobles and peasants alike to resume their normal duties.\r\nThe spare horses from the army, to the number of 35,000, and many\r\nrations for man and beast from the magazines were at once distributed\r\nto the most needy. Officials allotted to the peasants wood to rebuild\r\ntheir houses and sums of money to assist the work. Their rents were\r\nremitted for a time, and oxen, cows, sheep, meal, and seed-corn were\r\nsupplied to them free of charge. The State reaped its reward in the\r\nrents and taxes which speedily flowed into the royal coffers, as well\r\nas in the rapid growth of population.\r\n\r\nWhile the King was thus doling out relief to a great part of his\r\nsubjects, he indulged in a singular extravagance which has been the\r\nsubject of much criticism and conjecture. Though he inequitably threw\r\nupon the people the expense of restoring the coinage, though his\r\nsubjects were sending him sheaves of petitions for aid, though he\r\nwas of all monarchs the least addicted to pomp, none the less, three\r\nmonths after peace had been signed he began to build a third palace at\r\nPotsdam. The astonished Prussians believed that the cost was 22,000,000\r\nthalers. If no more than one-tenth of this was actually expended, the\r\nKing lavished on a superfluity more than one-third of the sum that he\r\nassigned to the restoration of the land.\r\n\r\nThose who insist that he did nothing without a motive of State may find\r\nit in his desire to convince foreign Powers that it was dangerous to\r\nattack a nation which could afford luxuries while its enemies were deep\r\nin debt. Other conjectures are possible. Frederick loved to indulge\r\nthe hope that the Sciences, which had visited Greece and Italy, France\r\nand England, in turn, might settle for a while in Prussia, and the\r\nnew palace, like the salary paid to Voltaire, might be regarded as a\r\nsacrifice at their altar. The claims of the new Prussian industries,\r\nespecially the manufacture of silk, which was largely used in adorning\r\nthe interior, may have induced the King to provide an artificial market\r\nin this way. Frederick’s Versailles, however, remains to this day both\r\na monument to his absolutism and an enigma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW PALACE AT POTSDAM.]\r\n\r\nAbsolutism and diligence are still the hall-marks of all his measures.\r\nThe military reforms, the work of restoration, and the attention paid\r\nto the arts taxed him but lightly when compared with his labours for\r\nthe development of the agriculture, manufactures, commerce, and finance\r\nof his dominions. No sooner was the war at an end and the work of\r\nrestoration set on foot than Frederick began to pour forth a flood of\r\nedicts for the regulation and advance of every department of national\r\nlife, and to engage in incessant labours of inspection to see that\r\nthey were carried out.\r\n\r\nIn promoting agriculture he was guided by principles with which we\r\nare already familiar. His prime rule was still to increase the number\r\nof tillers of the soil and to make them safe against starvation.\r\nHe therefore continued to bring in colonists from far and near, to\r\ndrain marshes, to reclaim wastes, and to build new habitations. It is\r\ncomputed that at the close of his reign one-fifth or one-sixth of his\r\nsubjects were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. Besides a\r\nknowledge of husbandry and handicraft which in many cases surpassed\r\nthat of the Prussians, the aliens brought with them substantial\r\nadditions to the material wealth of the land. The official inventory of\r\ntheir belongings, though incomplete, shows that 6392 horses, 7875 head\r\nof cattle, 20,548 sheep, 3227 pigs, and upwards of 2,000,000 thalers in\r\nmoney were thus added to the capital of the nation.\r\n\r\nTo provide for the accommodation of the recruits to his army of\r\nagriculture, the King applied every art of government to bring new\r\nland under cultivation and to increase the fertility of the old. The\r\nsuperior enlightenment of Prussia was attested by the curt refusal\r\nof Brunswick and Hanover to co-operate in works of drainage. No site\r\nfor a farmstead was to be left vacant and in the forests—so ran the\r\ndecree—“no place where a tree can stand, unplanted.” The sterile\r\nnature of the soil challenged the unwearied industry of the King. Many\r\ncenturies before blotting-paper came to be known, Brandenburg was\r\nnicknamed “the sand-box of the Holy Roman Empire.” Thousands of acres\r\nhad to be set with bushes to prevent its surface from being blown over\r\nthe neighbouring fields.\r\n\r\n    “I confess,” wrote Frederick to Voltaire, “that with the\r\n    exception of Libya few states can boast that they equal us in\r\n    the matter of sand. Yet we are bringing 76,000 acres under\r\n    cultivation this year as pasture. This pasture feeds 7,000\r\n    cows, whose dung will manure and improve the land, and the\r\n    crops will be of more value.”\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of the royal philosopher writing to Voltaire about\r\nmanure and walking almost daily from Sans Souci to his turnip-field\r\nis a visible proof of Frederick’s devotion to this branch of his\r\nstewardship. He was wont to speak with authority as the leading\r\nagriculturist of the realm. Here, as elsewhere, his breadth of view\r\noften enabled him to discern the best product or practice in other\r\nlands, and his command of resources to transport it to his own. Having\r\nonce attained his object by teaching his subjects to produce an article\r\nat home, he imperatively forbade them to import it from abroad. The\r\nfull reward of his policy would be reaped when Prussia began to supply\r\nit to other countries in exchange for gold and silver.\r\n\r\nA single instance of the minuteness and imperiousness with which the\r\nKing applied this policy to agriculture may be cited from Professor\r\nKoser’s history of the reign. The Berlin egg-market was still dependent\r\non foreign supply. In 1780 a royal hen-census showed that there were\r\n324,175 hens in the Electoral Mark and that 36,300 more were required\r\nto meet the demand for eggs. “What will it matter,” asked the King,\r\n“if every peasant keep ten or twelve more hens? Their food does not\r\ncost much; they can pick up most of it in the straw and dung of the\r\nfarmyard.” Prohibition of the import of foreign eggs followed. This\r\ncaused the market price to rise and the ministers expressed the fear\r\nthat the supply would not be sufficient. The King rejoined:\r\n\r\n    “It is all the fault of the farmers and peasants for not\r\n    setting about it. I have laboured forty years to introduce\r\n    things of this kind. If the ministers want to eat eggs, let\r\n    them take more trouble with the Chambers to carry it through.\r\n    The prohibition of foreign eggs remains as before.”\r\n\r\nOnly a six months’ interval was allowed later to give the new\r\nestablishments time to develop.\r\n\r\nAll through his reign Frederick set his face firmly against any attempt\r\nto bridge over the gulf which divided the country from the town. The\r\ntobacco and sugar with which the peasant solaced himself, the clothes\r\nhe wore, the plough and hoe which served him to till the fields were\r\nall made more costly in order that the towns might thrive. The vast\r\nmajority of handicrafts might be practised only within their walls. On\r\nthe other hand, the King’s ordinances against artisans who meddled with\r\nfarming were so severe that they could not be strictly carried out. He\r\nalso tried many measures with a view to conferring upon the peasant a\r\nsecure position on the soil. He was successful in preventing the nobles\r\nfrom buying up the holdings of the class below them. He established\r\nsome three hundred new villages by breaking up outlying farms. But\r\nin other directions even his autocratic power failed to overcome the\r\npassive resistance of the rural population.\r\n\r\nIn theory, Frederick was a champion of human freedom. He condemned\r\nslavery in strong terms and viewed askance the legal position of the\r\nPrussian countryfolk whom their lords regarded as so many head of\r\nlabour. But he dared not shake the pillars of his army and of his\r\ntreasury by giving the peasant leave to quit the soil. He desired\r\nto retain serfdom, but only in its mildest form. He set his heart\r\non making every serf a hereditary tenant at a money rent. This was,\r\nhowever, repugnant both to the nobles, who feared that they would not\r\nbe able to secure labourers for hire, and to the peasants, who feared\r\nthat they would in future be obliged to bear the loss when their cattle\r\ndied and to pay their arrears of taxation themselves. The proposed\r\nreform, as well as an attempt to assign limits to the labour that the\r\nlords might lawfully exact, had therefore to be given up.\r\n\r\nA change of still more unquestionable benefit, of which England\r\nhad enjoyed the fruits for fully two centuries, likewise proved\r\nimpracticable in Prussia, even on the domains of the Crown. Each\r\nholder, whether noble or peasant, had a number of scattered strips of\r\nland in huge fields which were unenclosed and were ploughed and sown\r\nin common by the labour of the whole village. The abuses of such a\r\nsystem were manifold. It stereotyped the succession of crops, checked\r\nindividual enterprise, prevented the high cultivation which depended on\r\nthe aid of walls or hedges, and exposed the strips of the industrious\r\nto the spreading tares of his slothful neighbour. Frederick, once more\r\nguided by his loftier outlook on affairs, ordered commissioners to\r\nremedy this unprofitable system by a rearrangement of all the holdings.\r\nPeasants, bailiffs, ministers, all protested in vain, but Frederick\r\nin his turn commanded in vain. All that he could accomplish in his\r\nlifetime was the severance of noble from peasant land. He was compelled\r\nto content himself with abolishing practical slavery as distinguished\r\nfrom serfdom, with codifying the services due from the peasants, and\r\nwith other minor reforms.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been its effect in the long run, however, there\r\ncan be little doubt that it was Frederick’s deeds rather than his\r\nlaws which conferred the greatest immediate benefit upon Prussian\r\nagriculture. His subjects were assured, as were those of no other great\r\nmonarch in Europe, that there would be a market for their produce in\r\nyears of plenty, relief of their necessities in years of dearth, and\r\nsuccour from the State where fire or flood or pest would otherwise have\r\nruined them. This sense of security against starvation, though now so\r\ncommon that it is difficult to appreciate it, was then so rare that\r\nthousands of freemen left their native lands for the despotism and\r\nsterile soil of Prussia.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of industry Frederick was less hampered than in that of\r\nagriculture by the inertia of his people. He found Prussia making few\r\ncommodities save the simplest and exporting only three,—wool, linen,\r\nand wood. Before he died his minister, Hertzberg, could boast that\r\nevery conceivable manufacture found a home in his dominions.\r\n\r\nThe record of the steps by which the transformation was effected is\r\nsimply a further series of illustrations of the autocracy and diligence\r\nof the King. He strove with might and main to reanimate and develop\r\nthe old industries and to establish new ones. This involved incessant\r\ncontrivance and inspection on his part, the free use of subsidies by\r\nthe State, and the constant imposition of vexatious restrictions upon\r\nevery form of trade.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous examples of Frederick’s methods is the\r\ndevelopment of the porcelain industry of Berlin. During the Prussian\r\noccupation of Saxony the secret of the far-famed Dresden ware was\r\nextorted from the employees of Augustus. The King spared no effort to\r\nmake the most of his prize. He bought up the manufactory at Berlin,\r\nforbade all purchase of rival goods from abroad, installed porcelain\r\nat his own table in place of the gold and silver associated with royal\r\nstate, used porcelain snuffboxes, and bestowed samples of the finest\r\nproducts when convention prescribed a regal gift. To promote the\r\nwelfare of Prussia, Jews who wished to marry were compelled to purchase\r\na service of porcelain and to dispose of it abroad.\r\n\r\nWith the same unflinching resolution the King pursued his design of\r\nmaking Berlin a great industrial centre, of establishing manufactures\r\nin all his towns, and of forcing Prussia to provide for all her own\r\nneeds and for many of the needs of foreign lands. Every industry, silk\r\nand satin, cloth and linen, shipbuilding and mining, alike received the\r\nroyal stimulus and was compelled to submit to the royal interference.\r\nFrederick’s success varied, for in some cases it was more apparent\r\nthan in others that precepts, prohibitions, and subsidies could not\r\nmake good deficiencies of climate, skill, and enterprise. While the\r\nproduction of porcelain was firmly established, that of tobacco by\r\nno means fulfilled the expectations of the King. He commissioned a\r\nPrussian chemist to find out a sauce which would make the home-grown\r\nleaf at least comparable with the Virginian. The experiment, which\r\noccupied more than two and a half years, was furthered by all the\r\nresources of Government. No less than 1180 samples were tested. The\r\nreport of the General Tobacco Administration, however, stated that only\r\n34 of these were in any way better for the treatment, and that these\r\n34, “notwithstanding they made a brave show to outward seeming,” were\r\ntoo unsavoury even to be mixed with the products of Virginia.\r\n\r\nTwice a year the King with the aid of his ministers was wont to\r\ntake stock of his kingdom, and to measure the progress of all his\r\nschemes. In the interval he travelled through his provinces and issued\r\ninstructions for the amendment of all that he found amiss. “Schweidnitz\r\nand Neisse are still very short of tiled roofs, N. B., someone will\r\nhave to look to it” is one of fourteen points that he noted down in\r\nthe course of a visit to Silesia. No detail was too trifling for his\r\nattention. At the time when a paper manufactory was determined on,\r\ndoubt was expressed whether sufficient raw material in the shape of\r\nfine rags would be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n    “The ill custom prevails among us,” rejoined the King, “that\r\n    both in town and country the servant-girls make the best rags\r\n    into tinder to light the fire. We must try to break people of\r\n    it, and therefore the rag-collectors must be provided with\r\n    touch-wood, which is just as good as tinder for lighting a\r\n    fire, to give to the girls in exchange for rags.”\r\n\r\nA king who took upon his own shoulders so vast a share as did Frederick\r\nin regulating the agriculture and industry of his subjects could not\r\navoid concerning himself also with their foreign trade. The general\r\nprinciples of commercial policy which he followed were simple. He was\r\ndetermined to see that Prussian subjects sold as much as possible to\r\nforeigners and bought as little as possible from them in return. The\r\nlatter part of his task could be, and was, accomplished by prohibiting\r\nthe importation of certain commodities, such as salt, porcelain,\r\nand steel, and by appointing a host of customs-officers to make the\r\nprohibition effective. But to sell to foreigners goods which were\r\nproduced in Prussia chiefly because the King willed that his subjects\r\nshould forego the convenience of buying them from foreigners was a feat\r\nwhich taxed Frederick’s statecraft to the utmost.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that Prussian commerce did not thrive. Thanks\r\nto the strenuous efforts of King and ministers, who imported foreign\r\nartisans, endowed them with implements and homes, compelled natives to\r\nlearn crafts, bought sheep in Spain, forbade the export of raw material\r\nor the import of finished goods, forced the monasteries to support\r\nunprofitable industries, vetoed profitable industries that threatened\r\nin any way to prejudice their favourites, in short, exhausted the arts\r\nof government to foster production,—thanks to all this the Silesian\r\nexport of cloth and linen rose to between five and six million thalers\r\na year.\r\n\r\nThis result was not achieved by domestic interference only. The King\r\ndid not shrink from tariff wars with Austria and Saxony, nor from\r\nmuch toil to procure commercial treaties. It often appeared, however,\r\nthat there were spheres in which statecraft, even when practised by a\r\nFrederick, could accomplish little.\r\n\r\n    “When at that time a new republic arose across the ocean,”\r\n    writes Professor Koser, “King Frederick made haste to enter\r\n    into commercial relations with it, in order to exchange\r\n    cloth, woollen stuffs, and linen, iron goods and porcelain,\r\n    for rice, indigo, and Virginian tobacco. The ‘most favoured\r\n    nation’ treaty of 10 September, 1785, between Prussia and the\r\n    United States of America fulfilled, it is true, few of the\r\n    expectations which both parties formed of it, for the English,\r\n    who from a seafaring and capitalist point of view were more\r\n    competent, long continued to be the commercial intermediaries\r\n    between those renegade colonies and the Old World.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of his efforts the King endeavoured at different times to\r\nsupplant Hamburg, to ruin Danzig, and to make Silesia an impenetrable\r\nbarrier between Polish wool-growers and their customers in Saxony.\r\nIt was a peculiar feature of Prussia that her straggling frontiers\r\nwere crossed by many roads and rivers which connected foreign states.\r\nThe Hohenzollern laboured to turn this fact to account and to favour\r\nPrussian merchants by hampering foreigners with enormous tolls. The\r\nresult was that commerce was compelled to avoid the borders of his\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nFrederick was indefatigable in inciting his subjects to take up new\r\nenterprises as well as in striving to procure for them advantages\r\nabroad. As a rule, however, the commercial companies which he formed\r\neither decayed or relapsed into the position of State undertakings. It\r\nmay be surmised that what might have been possible to the Frederick\r\nand the Prussia of 1740 had been rendered well-nigh impossible by the\r\nchanges in both which a generation of militarism had produced. The\r\nsystem of despotic command and automatic obedience was fatal to the\r\ngrowth of a class of self-reliant merchants, and the King complained\r\nbitterly that neither individuals nor corporations would act with\r\nenlightened patriotism in developing the commerce of Prussia. Able\r\nadvisers of the Crown, indeed, did something to atone for this lack\r\nof initiative. Thanks to the talent of Hagen, the Bank, which was\r\nestablished in 1765, survived its early perils and became serviceable\r\nto Prussian trade. The Marine Commercial Company also outlived many of\r\nFrederick’s semi-official creations.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps in the sphere of taxation that Frederick’s unflinching\r\nautocracy is most remarkably displayed. He claimed not only to\r\nregulate the consumption of his people according to his own standard\r\nof propriety, but also to select agents to enforce his rules without\r\nthe smallest consideration for their feelings. Frederick wished to\r\nmake existence easier for the poor, especially for the soldier. He\r\ntherefore abolished the tax on grain, but subjected meat, beer, and\r\nwine to progressive imposts. Every Prussian was forced to buy from the\r\nState a fixed quantity of inferior salt at a price equal to four times\r\nits cost of production. The King’s delight in coffee did not make him\r\nblind to the fact that the State would gain more profit if his subjects\r\nwere forced to abandon it in favour of Prussian beer. Accordingly in\r\n1781 coffee became, like salt and tobacco, a monopoly of State and a\r\ntax of 250 per cent. upon its value was imposed. Frederick strove to\r\nrefute the remonstrances of the Pomeranian gentry with the words: “His\r\nMajesty’s high person was reared in youth on beer-soup, therefore the\r\npeople in that part can equally well be reared on beer-soup; it is\r\nmuch more wholesome than coffee.” The people, however, seem to have\r\nmitigated the inconvenience to which they were put by their King in\r\npart by brewing decoctions of herbs, but chiefly by smuggling. It has\r\nbeen estimated that no less than two-thirds of the coffee which they\r\nused was contraband. It boded ill for the State when to knock one of\r\nthe King’s spies on the head excited none of the odium of murder.\r\n\r\nThe measure which most of all estranged the hearts of the Prussians\r\nfrom their King dates, however, from the year 1766, when Frederick\r\nresolved to introduce the French system of farming out the indirect\r\ntaxes, or Regie. Not the system alone, but also the chief agents who\r\ncarried it into effect, were brought from France. The lessee-in-chief,\r\nde Launay, exercised great influence over the King, who accepted his\r\nopinion as to the possibilities of taxation in preference to that of\r\nhis Prussian commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe people, as was natural, detested an innovation which both wounded\r\ntheir Teutonic sensibilities and raised the price of food. De Launay\r\nand his assistants were caricatured as marching behind beasts laden\r\nwith rackets, foils, and fiddles, to avenge the shame of Rossbach on\r\nthe inhabitants of Berlin. Patriots might well chafe at the thought\r\nthat a new and foreign department was introduced into the General\r\nDirectory itself, and that whereas a Prussian minister was paid only\r\n4000 thalers a year, each of the four chief Frenchmen received 15,000.\r\nLess than ten per cent. of the 2000 tax-gatherers were foreigners, but\r\nthe Germans were insulted at being deemed fit for the lower grades\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nTheir murmurs, however, were powerless to alter the purpose of the\r\nKing. The innovation, indeed, was not recommended by conspicuous\r\nsuccess. Though it simplified the fiscal administration, a large\r\nproportion of the returns was still swallowed up by expenses of\r\ncollection. On a review of the twenty years, 1766–1786, the proceeds\r\nof the Regie seem to have been in no wise augmented by de Launay’s\r\nhated invasion. Yet Frederick adhered to his plan, kept the taxes high,\r\nadministered the funds of the State in secret, and crowned all by\r\nbringing coffee under the control of the French. To his fiscal measures\r\nmore than to all else was it due that the State which he had exalted\r\ndrew a deep breath of relief when he died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFREDERICK AND EUROPE, 1763–1786\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief significance of the Peace of Hubertusburg for Prussia was not\r\nexpressed in any of its clauses. The signature of the treaty implied\r\nthat Europe renounced the endeavour to deprive her of the rank among\r\nthe Great Powers which she had arrogated to herself in 1740. Their\r\nsurvival of the great ordeal conferred a new consequence upon Frederick\r\nand his State. “Frederick himself,” Mr. James Sime happily says,\r\n“acquired both in Germany and in Europe the indefinable influence which\r\nsprings from the recognition of great gifts that have been proved by\r\ngreat deeds.” The brief sketch of his domestic labours that has been\r\ngiven in Chapter X. suggests that he was not lacking in the energy\r\nwhich was needed to maintain this influence and to derive full profit\r\nfrom it. The history of his dealings with foreign Powers during the\r\nlatter half of his reign is the story of how this was done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PAINTING BY LISTARD.]\r\n\r\nFrom the moment at which he signed the treaty down to the day of his\r\ndeath, Frederick felt that Austria was still his enemy. Joseph II.,\r\nthe eldest son of the Queen, who was unanimously elected Emperor in\r\n1765, had learned politics from the King of Prussia. He desired nothing\r\nso much as to restore the immemorial pre-eminence of his House by a\r\nsudden blow at its upstart rival. Frederick, who had spies everywhere,\r\nwas soon acquainted with the ambitions of the restless youth. For\r\nthe present he could place some reliance on the pacific influence of\r\nthe Queen and more on the emptiness of the Austrian treasury, but he\r\nwas none the less compelled to make it his foremost task to thwart\r\nsuccessive Hapsburg schemes of aggrandisement.\r\n\r\nHis security was the greater, however, because the Peace of Paris\r\nof 1763 reconciled France and England as little as the Peace of\r\nHubertusburg reconciled Austria and Prussia. Frederick, it is true,\r\nwas still treated with coldness by the French, who clung to their\r\nalliance with the Queen, and he was resolved never again to trust an\r\nEnglish ministry. With a rare access of spite, indeed, he condemned the\r\ncharger which he had named after Lord Bute to be yoked with a mule and\r\nto perform humiliating duties in his sight. But though neither of the\r\nGreat Powers of the West was his ally, their latent hostility was still\r\ntoo incurable to permit them to unite against him.\r\n\r\nOn the remaining Great Power, therefore, the well-being of Prussia\r\ndepended. The Seven Years’ War of the future, which Frederick was\r\nalways labouring to avert by means of elaborate armaments, was\r\nimprobable if Russia stood neutral and impossible if she became his\r\nally. From 1763 onwards the Russian alliance was the prize for which\r\nhe strove. He had to surmount the obstacle that as sovereign of\r\nOst-Preussen he was the natural enemy of the Russian designs upon\r\nPoland. But Austria, on the other hand, besides being interested in\r\nPoland, was the natural enemy of the Russian designs upon the Turk.\r\nFrederick might reasonably hope that by humouring Russia to the extreme\r\nlimit which the interests of his State permitted, he might establish\r\na good understanding with her to the prejudice of the more formidable\r\nempire in the south.\r\n\r\nCatherine, whose throne was far from secure, seemed at first resolved\r\nto shun a new connexion with the ally of her murdered husband. Early in\r\nOctober, 1763, however, her neighbour, Augustus, died, and the stress\r\nof the election to the throne of Poland compelled her to seek the aid\r\nof some foreign Power. France, Austria, and finally the Russian faction\r\nin Poland all disappointed her, and she feared a hostile combination\r\nbetween Prussia and the Turk. On April 11, 1764, therefore, Frederick’s\r\ndesire was gratified. He bound himself to aid Catherine in upholding\r\nthe existing constitutional anarchy in Poland and in Sweden, and\r\nreceived in return the coveted Russian guarantee for Silesia. Then, by\r\nmeans of force and corruption, Stanislaus Poniatowski was installed as\r\nKing of Poland (September 7, 1764). “God said, let it be light, and it\r\nwas light,” was Frederick’s congratulation to Catherine. “You speak and\r\nthe world is silent before you.”\r\n\r\nIn accommodating himself without undue humility to the flighty humours\r\nof his imperious ally, and in appropriating for Prussia most of\r\nthe benefits of the compact, Frederick showed that experience had\r\ntaught him much. The state of Polish and Turkish affairs gave to the\r\nEastern Question of that day two storm-centres which threatened wide\r\nand immediate disturbance. Frederick, who was deep in his labours of\r\nrestoration and reform at home, desired above all to keep the peace.\r\nThis imposed upon him tasks of the utmost delicacy. He had to prevent\r\nthe formation of a Northern league which Russia desired, to cow Austria\r\nby means of the Russian alliance, to follow with the closest attention\r\nthe turbulent course of politics in Poland, to keep Austria from\r\nacquiring influence there, to check the military ardour of the Turk,\r\nand to hinder a _rapprochement_ between Austria and Russia. During more\r\nthan four years (April, 1764-October, 1768), he was able to stave off\r\nwar, and when at last France induced the Turks to attack Russia, he\r\nfound himself liable only to pay an annual subsidy of less than half a\r\nmillion thalers. In 1769 the alliance was prolonged till 1780.\r\n\r\nThe war between Russia and the Turks seemed to Frederick a pitiable\r\ndisplay of incompetence. “To form a correct idea of this war,” he\r\nwrote, “you must figure a set of purblind people who, by constantly\r\nbeating a set of altogether blind, end by gaining over them a complete\r\nmastery.” But the triumph of Russia, however achieved, threatened to\r\nkindle the general conflagration which he dreaded. It was clear that if\r\nleft to herself she would make conquests, and Austria was on the alert\r\nfor compensation. The Hapsburg claims might possibly be satisfied at\r\nthe expense of the Turk, but this resource was of no avail to furnish\r\nthe compensation which Prussia herself would not forego. Frederick cast\r\nlonging glances towards West-Preussen, but could not bring himself to\r\nbelieve that Russia would consent to an acquisition which would add\r\nimmensely to the power of a rival state. He therefore feared that the\r\nknot would yield only to the sword.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis the King twice met Joseph II. face to face. At Neisse,\r\nin August, 1769, little save a personal introduction was effected.\r\nFrederick professed to be charmed with the beautiful soul and noble\r\nambitions of the young Emperor, while Joseph reported to his mother\r\nthat the King talked admirably, but betrayed the knave in every word he\r\nspoke. At the second meeting, which took place in Moravia in September,\r\n1770, Frederick spared no effort to captivate Joseph and Kaunitz. He\r\ndonned the Austrian uniform of white, though he smilingly confessed\r\nthat his mania for snuff made him too dirty to wear it. He extolled\r\nthe Imperial grenadiers as worthy to guard the person of the God of\r\nWar. He made Laudon sit beside him, saying in graceful allusion to\r\nHochkirch and Kunersdorf, that he would rather have General Laudon at\r\nhis side than be obliged to face him. After sacrificing to the vanity\r\nof the Chancellor by listening for an hour to a monologue on political\r\naffairs, he won his heart by posing as a grateful convert to his views.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WENZEL ANTON, PRINCE VON KAUNITZ.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PAINTING BY STEINER.]\r\n\r\nThe result was that Frederick was able to offer Catherine the joint\r\nmediation of Austria and Prussia to end the war. The offer was not\r\naccepted, but it proved that the two foes were not irreconcilable.\r\nThe mere hint that Austria might compete for the Prussian alliance was\r\nenough to raise its value at St. Petersburg. It became clear, too,\r\nthat only the fear of Prussia was preventing Austria from interfering\r\non behalf of the Turk. Urged on by his brother Henry, who had just\r\nreturned from the Russian capital, Frederick determined early in 1771\r\nto take the risk of offending Russia and provoking Austria to war, in\r\norder to net his profit from this advantageous situation ere it changed.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1770 Austria had drifted, half involuntarily, into\r\nan occupation of Zips, a portion of the territory of Poland which was\r\nalmost surrounded by her own, and of some of the adjacent districts.\r\nFrederick now seized upon this, though the Queen was willing to draw\r\nback, as an excuse for pressing upon Russia a plan which he had\r\npromulgated under an alias at an early stage in the war. On February 1,\r\n1769, he had suggested to his ambassador at St. Petersburg\r\n\r\n    “that Russia should offer to the Court of Vienna Lemberg and\r\n    the surrounding country in return for support against the\r\n    Turks; that she should give us Polish Preussen with Ermland\r\n    and the protectorate over Danzig; and that she should herself\r\n    incorporate a suitable part of Poland by way of indemnity for\r\n    the expenses of the war.”\r\n\r\nThe plan of dismembering Poland because the Turks were defeated\r\nwas, as Frederick knew full well, distasteful to both of the Powers\r\nwhose complicity he desired. Russia was strongly opposed to any\r\naggrandisement of Prussia to the eastward. Austria, besides being\r\naverse to the aggrandisement of her rival in any quarter, preferred\r\nany lands to the Polish and any method to that of naked force. Yet the\r\nKing, while professing that he was an old man whose brain was worn out,\r\nsecured the co-operation of Russia within a year (15th January, 1772),\r\nand of Austria less than eight months later.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of his diplomacy was enhanced by the fact that he would\r\nhave been completely foiled if Austria had consented to join Russia\r\nin dismembering the Turk. As it was, he was permitted to enjoy the\r\nspectacle of the Queen struggling with her conscience and upbraiding\r\nherself, her Chancellor, and her son. She complained that they had\r\naimed at two incompatible objects at once, “to act in the Prussian\r\nfashion and at the same time to preserve the semblance of honesty.” The\r\nprospective additions to her domains were to her odious, since they\r\nwere “bought at the price of honour, at the price of the glory of the\r\nmonarchy, at the price of the good faith and religion, which are our\r\npeculiar possession.” “She is always weeping, but always annexing,”\r\nsneered the triumphant King.\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 1772, Austria signed the Treaty of Partition. By agreeing\r\nupon their demands the three Powers had accomplished the hardest part\r\nof their enterprise. The strength of Poland had been wasted by the\r\nanarchy which Russia and Prussia had studiously conserved. Since 1768,\r\nRomanists and Dissidents had been engaged in a bloody and desolating\r\nwar in which Russia, the protector of the Greek Church, played the\r\ndecisive part. No party among the Poles still retained sufficient\r\nenergy to oppose in arms the claims to Polish provinces which, in order\r\nto save appearances, were formulated by the Powers. Frederick even\r\nput forward a double title to Pomerellen, alleging that it had been\r\nwrongfully alienated by the Margrave of Brandenburg in 1311, and that\r\nif he as suzerain consented to overlook this irregularity, he would\r\nstill be entitled to the province as heir, since 1637, to the elder\r\nbranch of the House of Pomerania. He claimed Great Poland as heir of\r\nthe Emperor Sigismund, who had pawned it to the Teutonic Order, from\r\nwhich the Poles had wrested it by force. The remainder of his share was\r\ndue to him as compensation for the loss of the revenues of these two\r\nprovinces for so many centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Polish statesmen had no difficulty in refuting such nonsense as\r\nthis. But King Stanislaus was convinced that true patriotism dictated\r\nobedience in order to save what remained. France and England were too\r\nintent on their own affairs to interfere by force. Hence a mixture\r\nof persuasion, bribery, and the presence of 30,000 soldiers was\r\nsufficient to procure the unanimous acquiescence of the Diet after\r\nsix months’ negotiation (September 30, 1773). The Austrian ambassador\r\nwas astonished at the trifling sums for which the nobles sold their\r\nvotes. His Saxon colleague lamented that they shamelessly laid upon the\r\ngaming-tables the foreign gold with which they had just been bribed.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s share of the spoil amounted to more than sixteen thousand\r\nsquare miles, and in 1774 he was able quietly to filch two hundred\r\nadditional villages from Poland. Long before the Diet consented to the\r\ncession he had inaugurated Prussian rule. In June, 1772, he made a\r\ntriumphal entry into his new province. He gave out to all and sundry\r\nthat no one could envy his good fortune, for as he came he had seen\r\nnothing but sand, pines, heath, and Jews. “It is a very good and very\r\nprofitable acquisition,” he wrote to Prince Henry, “both for the\r\npolitical situation of the State and for its finances.” Men said that\r\nwithout Danzig, which along with Thorn remained Polish, West-Preussen\r\nwas but a trunk without a head, but the King was full of schemes for\r\npartitioning the trade of Danzig among his own ports. Voltaire, finding\r\nhim deaf to his exhortations to free the Greeks, lamented that the\r\nharbour of Danzig lay nearer his heart than the Piræus.\r\n\r\nSoon the poverty-stricken land echoed to the untiring march of\r\nHohenzollern progress. The contempt which the King openly expressed\r\nfor “this perfectly imbecile set with names ending in ki” was apparent\r\nin all his dealings with the privileged classes. His treatment of\r\nprivate estates as well as of provinces seemed to warrant the Poles\r\nwho added the word _Rapuit_ to the _Suum Cuique_ which they saw\r\ninscribed beneath the Prussian eagle. The local officials were simply\r\ndismissed from office, and their lands appropriated at the cost of a\r\ntrifling compensation. Though Frederick bound himself to respect the\r\nexisting rights and property of the Roman Catholics, the bishops\r\nand abbots likewise lost their lands, but in their case an allowance\r\namounting to nearly half of their previous incomes was conceded. Upon\r\nthe nobles a tax of one-quarter of their net revenues was imposed, but\r\nProtestants were entitled to a discount of twenty per cent. In the hope\r\nof cleansing West-Preussen of its Polish inhabitants, the King went so\r\nfar as to favour the purchase of noble lands by German peasants. Strict\r\nwatch was kept on the frontier for Polish immigrants who might try to\r\nenter the country.\r\n\r\nThe common people, however, could not but gain from the introduction of\r\nthat policy of developing all the resources of the land which formed\r\nthe Hohenzollern ideal of domestic government. Slavery was abolished\r\nand serfdom regulated. New waterways were dug. Colonists were brought\r\nin by thousands. Prussian soldiers scoured the country in search of\r\ngipsies, tramps, and begging Jews. Toleration, justice, and education\r\nwere established where all three had been far to seek. The peasants and\r\ntownsmen were subjected to the Prussian system of taxation, which laid\r\nupon their shoulders a burden heavy indeed, but steady and not beyond\r\ntheir strength. Soon the royal revenue from West-Preussen amounted to\r\nmore than two million thalers a year.\r\n\r\nBut for a timely revival of energy in her royal House, it is not\r\nimpossible that Sweden, like Poland, would have been the poorer for the\r\nRusso-Prussian alliance. In 1769 Catherine and Frederick had pledged\r\nthemselves to maintain anarchy in Stockholm as well as in Warsaw.\r\nShould the existing constitution be modified, Russia would take up\r\narms and Frederick’s contribution to the war was to be the invasion of\r\nSwedish Pomerania. It is easy to imagine that with Russia and Prussia\r\nin cordial agreement and France and England embroiled or apathetic,\r\na war with Sweden might have resulted in the annexation of Finland\r\nand the remainder of Pomerania by the allies. In 1772, however, young\r\nGustavus III., the son of Frederick’s sister Ulrica, delivered Sweden\r\nfrom the trammels of her constitution by an unlooked-for _coup d’état_.\r\nRussia, which was still hampered by the Turkish war, was unable to wage\r\nwar against the revolution, and Frederick, who for once was taken by\r\nsurprise, grudgingly accepted the apologies of his nephew.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Frederick’s life was dedicated to the defence of the\r\nposition that he had already attained. He was determined to do nothing\r\nthat could prejudice his cause in a future struggle with Austria. He\r\ntherefore looked on while Russia and Austria despoiled the Turk in\r\n1774, while England and her Colonies fell to blows in the next year,\r\nand while France joined in the fray in 1778. His private opinion,\r\nindeed, was that the country which could commit its destinies to a Bute\r\ncould hardly fail to be in the wrong. He blamed the English both for\r\npolitical and military folly—for beginning a terrible civil war with no\r\nsettled plans or adequate preparations, for underestimating the enemy’s\r\nforce, for dividing her own and for trampling upon the rights of\r\nneutrals. But he avoided with the most scrupulous care any action that\r\ncould give offence to either combatant, and declared to his ministers\r\nthat he intended to await the issue quietly and to throw in his lot\r\nwith the side which fortune favoured.\r\n\r\nIn the very year in which France allied herself with the Colonies\r\nagainst England (1778) Frederick’s long-expected struggle with Austria\r\ncame to pass. Joseph II., whose restless desire to imitate the\r\nachievements of the King of Prussia was not satisfied by his gains\r\nfrom Poland and the Turk, thought that the moment had arrived for\r\nacquiring a portion of Bavaria, the great geographical obstacle to the\r\nconsolidation of the Hapsburg lands. At the close of the year 1777 the\r\nElector of Bavaria died, and his lands passed by right to the aged and\r\nchildless Elector Palatine. Austria, however, furbished up a claim to a\r\nconsiderable portion of eastern Bavaria, and on January 14, 1778, the\r\nElector was half bribed, half frightened into acquiescence. Two days\r\nlater 10,000 Austrian troops occupied the ceded districts. Joseph’s\r\ntriumph seemed to be assured.\r\n\r\nFrederick, however, had still to be reckoned with. Though his health\r\nwas indifferent and his desire was all for peace, he took up the\r\nchallenge without an hour’s delay. Determined, as he said, “once for\r\nall to humble Austrian ambition,” he assumed his ancient pose as\r\nchampion of the German princes against an Emperor who was trampling\r\nupon their constitutional rights. “I know very well,” he owned to\r\nPrince Henry, “that it is only our own interest which makes it our\r\nduty to act at this moment, but we must be very careful not to say\r\nso.” Few volunteers, however, declared themselves on his side. The\r\nElector’s cousin and heir, Duke Charles of Zweibrücken, became a pawn\r\nin Frederick’s hands, and the Elector of Saxony, who had claims on the\r\nestate of the dead prince, promised 21,000 men. But his only other\r\nally was Bavarian public opinion, which was shocked at the idea of\r\npartition. The Bavarians, according to the current jest, left off their\r\npious invocation of “Jesu, Mary, Joseph,” and cried to “Jesu, Mary,\r\nFrederick” to deliver them.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian statesmen were willing enough to negotiate, but they clung\r\nto the gains which they had made. Their preparations for war were not\r\ncomplete, but they did not believe that Prussia meant to fight. Both\r\nsides, indeed, hoped more from negotiation than from battle. It became\r\nevident, too, that Frederick was no longer the general whose delight\r\nwas in swift and resolute movements. Not till April 6, 1778, did he\r\nmarch from Berlin, and then he drew rein in southern Silesia, and spent\r\nthree months more in fruitless haggling. At last, on July 3rd, he made\r\na declaration of war, and two days later completed his march across the\r\nmountains into Bohemia. Even then the Queen brought herself to beg for\r\npeace, so that, although hostilities continued, August was half gone\r\nbefore the diplomatists finally dispersed.\r\n\r\nThe War of the Bavarian Succession formally began, however, when\r\nFrederick set out for Bohemia, on July 3, 1778. He was attacking with\r\ntwo armies, each about 80,000 strong. Earlier in the year he had hoped\r\nthat the main Austrian force would assemble in Moravia. In that case\r\nhis plan was to lead his own army from Silesia against it, to win a\r\ngreat victory, and thus to compel the enemy to call back their troops\r\nfrom Bohemia. This would make it easy for Prince Henry with a combined\r\nhost of Prussians and Saxons to advance on Prague while the King made\r\nprogress in Moravia. The two armies, if all continued to go well, would\r\nthen press forward towards the Danube.\r\n\r\nThe plan was spoiled, however, because the Austrians were bold enough\r\nto choose north-eastern Bohemia for their place of concentration.\r\nThere they were indeed further from Vienna, but they secured greater\r\npossibilities of offensive action. If Frederick invaded Moravia they\r\ncould overrun Silesia behind his back or fall upon Prince Henry and\r\nSaxony in overwhelming force. The King, therefore, reluctantly turned\r\naside into Bohemia by way of Nachod in order to engage the enemy’s\r\nattention until his brother, marching from Dresden, should have\r\nestablished himself firmly in the north.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Bohemia, Frederick found the Austrians some 250,000\r\nstrong. Joseph and Lacy with the bulk of the troops confronted him in\r\na position on the Elbe nearly fifty miles in length and as strong as\r\nwater, earthworks, and cannon could make it. Judging it impregnable,\r\nFrederick waited impatiently for his brother to get the better of\r\nLaudon, who was guarding the northern gate into Bohemia. The army\r\nchafed at the enforced inaction, but the King still hoped by sending\r\nrepeated detachments to Moravia to compel the enemy to meet him there\r\nin the field.\r\n\r\nPrince Henry, after hesitating for some time between different routes,\r\nperformed his task to perfection. Early in August he led his army\r\nover the mountains to the east of the Elbe by ways hitherto reputed\r\nimpassable. Laudon was at his wits’ end. He fell back upon the line\r\nof the Iser, but on August 14th, Joseph himself admitted that he was\r\ntoo weak to hold it. If Laudon were driven off, the great position on\r\nthe Elbe would be untenable, but Prince Henry lacked the hardihood to\r\nventure the decisive move. Dissensions between the royal brothers and\r\nthe failure of their efforts to effect a junction justified the policy\r\nof their opponents, who, Frederick sneered, seemed to be turned into\r\nstone. Soon the movements of the Prussians were dictated largely by\r\nhunger and the conflict earned its nickname of the Potato War. Heavy\r\nrains completed their discomfiture. By the middle of October the\r\nexultant Austrians had seen the last of the invaders.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1778 cost the combatants some 20,000 men and 29,000,000\r\nthalers in money. Frederick had shown himself captious and irresolute.\r\nHis brother declared that he was more on his guard against the\r\ntreachery of the King than against the enterprises of the enemy. The\r\narmy had become dejected, ill-disciplined, and disaffected. Frederick,\r\nthough he prepared to invade Moravia in the spring, spent the winter\r\nin working his hardest for peace. France and Russia lent their aid. In\r\nMarch, 1779, a congress of the four Powers met at Teschen, and on May\r\n13th peace was signed.\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Teschen was in some degree a triumph for Frederick. The\r\nchief points for which he had taken up arms were secured at no great\r\ncost. The Austrian acquisitions were limited to the Quarter of the Inn,\r\na strip of territory bounded on the west by that river, while Bavaria\r\nwas obliged to pay 4,000,000 thalers in settlement of the Saxon claims.\r\nPrussia seemed thus to have maintained the rights of two great German\r\nprinces from motives of pure patriotism. Her military prestige, on\r\nthe other hand, had suffered. She had not derived prompt support from\r\nher intimacy with Russia and she had failed to disturb the connexion\r\nbetween Austria and France. No less than four royal marriages now\r\nlinked the Bourbons to their secular foes the Hapsburgs. By accepting\r\nthe guarantee of France and Russia to a treaty in which the Peace of\r\nWestphalia was once more confirmed, Prussia had moreover paved the way\r\nfor unwelcome foreign intrusions into German affairs.\r\n\r\nFrederick saw good reason to fear that the danger from Austria would be\r\nrenewed so soon as Joseph should be emancipated from the restraining\r\ninfluence of the aged Queen. For the time being, however, he was\r\nfree to resume his round of toil, to mourn the loss of Voltaire, to\r\ncorrespond with the philosopher d’Alembert, and to pursue reforms\r\nin law and education. The Prussian judges were now empowered to\r\ninterrogate the parties to suits and compelled to hear what they had\r\nto say. A codification of the law and a Book of Rights which should\r\nstereotype the existing feudal system of society in Prussia were set\r\non foot. And at the moment when Romanist sovereigns drove out the\r\nJesuits, Frederick welcomed the fugitives as harmless individuals, who\r\ncould help to supply one of the most pressing needs of the State by\r\ninstructing the common people.\r\n\r\nThe lack of qualified elementary teachers in Frederick’s dominions\r\nwas attested by the fact that in 1763 an edict of educational reform\r\nin Silesia permitted them to continue such employments as tailoring,\r\nbut forbade them to eke out their incomes by peddling, by selling\r\nbeer or brandy, or by fiddling in public-houses. A counsel of despair\r\nhad been to set the worn-out sergeants to keep school. Out of 3443\r\nof them, however, only 79 were reported by the military officials as\r\npossibly fit to serve, and investigation by the civil authorities still\r\nfurther reduced the number. Under such conditions as these the influx\r\nof members of an order which had long been famous for its schools was\r\nregarded by the King as a boon to Prussia. To grant them an asylum\r\ngratified his real love of toleration, without in his opinion involving\r\nthe smallest peril to the allegiance of his subjects.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, however, Frederick was unpleasantly reminded of\r\nhis insecurity. In the summer of 1780, Austria secured a portion of\r\nthe Bavarian inheritance which it was beyond his power to take away.\r\nIn spite of all his diplomacy, the mighty sees of Cologne and Münster\r\nfell into Hapsburg hands. At this moment of triumph, Maria Theresa died\r\n(November 29, 1780). “She has done honour to her throne and to her\r\nsex,” wrote the King to d’Alembert. “I have made war against her, but\r\nI have never been her enemy.”\r\n\r\nThough Frederick regarded his great antagonist as bigoted and\r\nhypocritical, he mourned her sincerely, for her death removed the most\r\npotent check upon her son. Joseph seemed to have inherited his mother’s\r\nenergy, without her reverence for existing institutions. He now plunged\r\ninto a medley of hasty and sweeping reforms, treating the inhabitants\r\nof his miscellaneous provinces as cavalierly as though he were a\r\nFrederick and they submissive Prussians. The King could afford to look\r\non while Joseph and Kaunitz embroiled themselves with the landowners,\r\nthe Hungarians, and the Church. It was not long, however, before their\r\nforeign policy compelled him to active interference.\r\n\r\nSince 1780 the Russian alliance had failed him. He valued it as a\r\nmeans of preserving peace, but the policy which now prevailed at St.\r\nPetersburg looked towards war. Frederick, who was strangely blind to\r\nthis, declared in response to the blandishments of the Czarina that\r\nthe time was not ripe to seize more of Poland (1779). He proposed the\r\nadmission of the Turk into the league at the moment when Catherine was\r\ndreaming of a new crusade. In Joseph, on the other hand, the Czarina\r\nfound a willing partner in a policy of adventure. From the time when\r\nhe visited her in the summer of 1780, the alliance between Russia\r\nand Prussia was practically dead. Frederick sacrificed to it in May,\r\n1781, by joining the Armed Neutrality which Russia had organised in\r\norder to check the high-handed treatment of neutral vessels by Great\r\nBritain. But in the same month Catherine and Joseph made a defensive\r\nalliance for eight years. Frederick rightly divined that the ambitious\r\nCzarina had won the Emperor’s countenance to the scheme of a revival by\r\nRussia of the old Eastern Empire. Her eldest grandson was destined to\r\nbe Czar of all the Russias. Her second was named after the founder of\r\nConstantinople and suckled by six Greek nurses. The third, sneered the\r\nKing, when another was expected, would presumably become Great Mogul.\r\n\r\nBut though Frederick regarded Catherine as pretentious, saying that if\r\nshe were corresponding with God the Father she would claim at least\r\nequal rank, none knew better than he the value of her alliance. In 1762\r\nRussia had turned the scale, and had she been favourable to the plan,\r\nJoseph’s bold throw for Bavaria might have been successful. It was no\r\nlight matter for Frederick that in his old age his State was threatened\r\nby an Emperor whose thoughts were still running on Silesia and who had\r\nsucceeded in seducing his sole ally. France and England were beyond\r\nthe range of his overtures, and when the Russian armies moved in\r\n1783 Europe believed that the Turk was about to be finally expelled.\r\nFrederick, it seemed, was doomed to perilous isolation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNTER DEN LINDEN IN 1780.\r\n\r\nFROM AN ETCHING BY ROSENTAG.]\r\n\r\nOne force indeed remained—a force difficult to marshal, but as Charles\r\nV. had found, formidable when marshalled—which Frederick might hope\r\nto rally to his side. The tilted balance of Europe might still be\r\nredressed in Germany. By his conduct in the affair of the Bavarian\r\nSuccession Frederick had proved that it was not impossible for Germans\r\nto trust him, and since that time Austria by fresh aggressions had\r\nalienated from herself the general body of Romanist opinion among\r\nthem. It appeared that the Empire which was a corporation for the\r\npreservation of rights had acquired in Joseph a head who set at naught\r\nall rights save those of Austria. The inevitable result was that the\r\nprinces began to think of uniting in self-defence.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the year 1784, Frederick devoted himself to\r\nthe task of organising a confederacy of German States to defend the\r\nexisting constitution. This was a far more arduous undertaking than\r\nany negotiation with a single Great Power. It was always difficult to\r\ninduce a number of naturally jealous neighbours to combine. In 1784\r\nthe difficulty was increased threefold. The danger from Austria was\r\ngeneral and prospective, rather than specific and imminent. It might\r\nbe averted, indeed, by maintaining an equality of strength between\r\nPrussia and Austria, but the princes would beware of embarking upon a\r\ncourse which might make Prussia the stronger of the two. Frederick,\r\nmoreover, was compelled to entrust a great share in the negotiations to\r\nhis ministers. His chief agent, Hertzberg, had dared to form political\r\nideas of his own. In the hope that a _rapprochement_ with Austria would\r\nlead to further gains in Poland, he quietly obstructed the measures of\r\nthe aged King.\r\n\r\nThe inactivity of the Prussian ministers might have delayed the\r\nconfederation indefinitely had not all Germany been shocked by the\r\nsudden revival of the Emperor’s designs upon Bavaria. Again, just as\r\nseven years earlier, Austria corrupted the Elector Palatine without\r\nthe privity of his heir and again her acquisition of the Electorate\r\nwas paraded before the world as an accomplished fact. In the first\r\ndays of January, 1785, Rumianzow, the Russian agent at the German\r\nDiet, suddenly presented to the Duke of Zweibrücken a joint demand of\r\nAustria and Russia for his acceptance of a bargain to which the Elector\r\nPalatine had already consented. The substance of this was that Bavaria\r\nwas assigned to the Emperor in return for the Austrian Netherlands, the\r\ntitle of King, and handsome rewards in money.\r\n\r\n“I, who am already more than half beyond this world,” complained\r\nFrederick to his brother, “am forced to double my wisdom and activity,\r\nand continually keep in my head the detestable plans that this curséd\r\nJoseph begets afresh with every fresh day. I am condemned to enjoy no\r\nrest before my bones are covered with a little earth.” His energy,\r\nnone the less, was as great as the crisis demanded. Austria was always\r\nhampered in time of war because the distant Netherlands were hers\r\nas much as because the adjacent Bavaria was not. The exchange was\r\ntherefore most alluring, but the opposition of Prussia to the scheme\r\nwas so stout as to evoke disclaimers from all the parties to it.\r\nCatherine protested that she would countenance no violation of the\r\nPeace of Teschen. Louis XVI., whom Frederick believed to have been\r\nbribed by the offer of Luxemburg, stated in answer to his protests\r\nthat the Emperor renounced the scheme. Before the end of February,\r\n1785, the danger was past.\r\n\r\nTo guard against its recurrence Frederick none the less completed the\r\n_Fürstenbund_ or League of Princes. On July 23, Prussia, Saxony, and\r\nHanover entered into an alliance, with the object of safeguarding the\r\nlands and rights of every member of the Empire. By separate articles\r\nthe three Electors bound themselves to act together in Imperial\r\nbusiness. The accession of the Archbishop of Mainz, who as president\r\nof the Electoral College had a casting vote, both gave the League a\r\nmajority at the election of the Emperor, and prevented it from being\r\nregarded as a mere clique of Protestants. Frederick’s triumph was\r\ncomplete when, in spite of the diplomatic opposition of the Emperor, a\r\nhost of German princes accepted the result of his work. The rulers of\r\nZweibrücken, Hesse-Cassel, Gotha, Weimar, Brunswick, Ansbach, Baden,\r\nAnhalt, Mecklenburg, and Osnabrück formed with the four protagonists a\r\ngreat body of organised German conservatism led by the King of Prussia.\r\nFrederick in his old age had improvised with marvellous success a\r\ntemporary insurance against the greatest danger that visibly threatened\r\nhis State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFREDERICK’S DEATH AND GREATNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe League of 1785 was Frederick’s last contribution to the politics of\r\nEurope. He felt that his days were numbered, but answered the summons\r\nof Death only by quickening the step with which he had long traversed\r\nthe routine of daily duty. In his last months he remained true to\r\nhis long-cherished ideal of life and still proved himself diligent,\r\nimperious, stoical, and even gay.\r\n\r\nThe fatal shock to his health, which was already shaken by gout and\r\ndyspepsia, seems to have been given at a review in Silesia on August\r\n24, 1785. After the manœuvres of the previous year he had written\r\nto the Infantry Inspector-General of the province that he was more\r\ndissatisfied with his troops than ever before. “Were I to make\r\nshoemakers or tailors into generals, the regiments could not be worse,”\r\ndeclared the King by way of prelude to more particular strictures. He\r\nthreatened court-martial in the following year to whomsoever should not\r\nthen fulfil his duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH-MASK OF FREDERICK THE GREAT.\r\n\r\nFROM THE ORIGINAL IN THE HOHENZOLLERN MUSEUM, BERLIN.]\r\n\r\nWhen the time arrived for the visit of 1785 to Silesia, no symptoms of\r\ndisorder could keep the King from his post. As he made his usual\r\ntour of inspection, thousands of the country-folk flocked in to see him\r\npass and to utter their gratitude for his subsidies. So he arrived at\r\nthe review of August 22nd-25th, which was held in the plain that lies\r\nsouth of Breslau, and which military Europe regarded as one of the\r\ngreatest tactical displays of the year.\r\n\r\nOn the third morning of the four, Frederick insisted on teaching his\r\nmen their duty by sitting his horse for six hours in a deluge of rain\r\nwithout the shelter of a cloak. In spite of the inevitable chill, he\r\nthen presided at dinner, at which the Duke of York, Lafayette, and\r\nCornwallis were among the guests. Fever and ague followed, but he shook\r\nthem off in a night and completed the review, the progress through\r\nSilesia, the journey to Potsdam, and the inspection of artillery at\r\nBerlin. On September 10th, he left his capital for the last time.\r\n\r\nAt Potsdam, on the eve of the Grand Review, the blow fell. Within a\r\nmonth of his indiscretion in Silesia he was seized in the night with\r\na fit of apoplexy (September 18–19, 1785). Gout, asthma, dropsy, and\r\nerysipelas set in, and after days of torment he was compelled to spend\r\nhis nights in fighting for breath in an armchair. Yet no disease could\r\nbreak his spirit. “There is traceable,” says Carlyle with fine insight,\r\n“only a complete superiority to Fear and Hope.”\r\n\r\nPartly, perhaps, because Austrian troops might menace the frontiers if\r\nhis weakness were known, but doubtless in part out of fortitude and\r\npride, he concealed his illness so far as possible from his subjects\r\nand from his friends. He performed the labours of the Cabinet with\r\nunclouded brain and with a growing fever of energy. His mind was full\r\nof plans for establishing new villages upon the districts reclaimed\r\nfrom the sand, for providing technical instruction in agriculture, and\r\nfor arranging the coming manœuvres in Silesia. He continued to read\r\nhistory day by day, and to converse cheerfully with his friends. Once\r\nhe enquired of the Duke of Courland whether he needed a good watchman,\r\nmaintaining that his sleeplessness at nights qualified him to fill the\r\npost. After seven months of suffering he entertained Mirabeau with\r\nlively conversation, though his state was so pitiable as to render the\r\ninterview painful to his favoured guest.\r\n\r\nVery early on the morning of April 17, 1786, he left the palace\r\nin Potsdam town, where he had passed the winter, and made a long,\r\ncircuitous journey to his favourite abode, Sans Souci. But the change\r\nwas powerless to bring relief. Some days he was too weak to converse as\r\nusual with his guests. On June 30th, however, he shocked his doctor by\r\ntaking a copious dinner of strong soup full of spices, beef steeped in\r\nbrandy, maize and cheese flavoured with, garlic, and a whole plateful\r\nof pungent eel-pie. Four days later he actually quitted his chair for a\r\nshort gallop on horseback, but the exertion left him prostrate.\r\n\r\nAgain he rallied, and until the middle of August disease and his\r\ninflexible determination to accomplish the daily routine struggled\r\nfor the mastery. On August 10th, he sent a tender little note to his\r\nwidowed sister Charlotte of Brunswick. “The old,” wrote the dying\r\nKing, “must give place to the young, that each generation may find\r\nroom clear for it: and life, if we examine strictly what its course\r\nis, consists in seeing one’s fellow-creatures die and be born.” By an\r\nalmost pathetic chance his last letter, written on August 14th, was to\r\nde Launay, demanding more minute accounts of the hated excise.\r\n\r\nFrederick, like his ancestors, died at his post. The Great Elector,\r\nwhose only fear was that dropsy might unfit him to govern, held a\r\nPrivy Council within two days of the end. Frederick William amid all\r\nhis torments spent his last days in private conference with his heir.\r\nFrederick, an older man than either, began work at five o’clock on\r\nthe morning of Tuesday, August 15th. He made the arrangements for a\r\nreview at Potsdam and dictated despatches of weight with all his wonted\r\nclearness. On Wednesday he failed, struggling in vain to give his\r\nweeping general the parole. All that day he lay in his chair dying,\r\nattended by valets, ministers, and physicians. In the evening he slept,\r\nand when eleven o’clock struck he enquired the time and declared that\r\nhe would rise at four. Towards midnight he asked for his favourite dog\r\nand bade them cover it with a quilt. Then for more than two hours his\r\nfaithful valet Strützky knelt by his chair to keep him upright, passing\r\nboth his arms around the half-unconscious King. At twenty minutes past\r\ntwo in the morning of August 17th, Frederick passed quietly away.\r\n\r\nHertzberg closed his eyes and led his nephew and successor, Frederick\r\nWilliam, to the corpse. The King had willed to be buried on the terrace\r\nof Sans Souci, but he could now command no longer. Throughout one day,\r\nAugust 18th, he lay in state at Potsdam. In the evening his coffin was\r\nborne to a vault in the garish church of the Potsdam garrison, where it\r\nrests by the side of his father’s.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s fame, as was inevitable in the case of one who died on\r\nthe eve of the French Revolution, has fluctuated with the current of\r\nsubsequent events. The world that he quitted paid to his memory the\r\nhomage due to one who had been for a generation the foremost among\r\nits princes. Among his poorer subjects traces of a warmer feeling may\r\nbe discerned. The legend of the Prussian soldier who boasted all his\r\nlife that Frederick had answered his challenge with the words, “Dog,\r\nhold thy peace,” is doubtless symbolic of the attitude of many of the\r\nrank and file. It would be idle to imagine that multitudes of humble\r\nserfs did not bewail the loss of the Father whose charity succoured\r\nthem in time of need and whose equity they could always invoke against\r\noppression. It would be no less idle to imagine that among his veteran\r\nservants no hearts beat in unison with the heart of General Lentulus,\r\nwho craved the honour of following his great chief as rear-guard, since\r\nZieten, who died earlier in the year, had secured the place of pride in\r\nthe van.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFINS OF FREDERICK THE GREAT (RIGHT) AND FREDERICK\r\nWILLIAM I. (LEFT) IN THE GARRISON CHURCH AT POTSDAM.]\r\n\r\nBerlin, however, rejoiced that Frederick was no more. The cry of the\r\nhour was, Back to Frederick William I! Led by a silly King (1786–1797)\r\nPrussia plunged into a Teutonic reaction. Good-humour, pomp,\r\naggressive orthodoxy, the use of the German speech, and a grandiose\r\nforeign policy marked the royal condemnation of Frederick’s practices.\r\nPrussia was tempted by profits in Poland and in Germany to regard the\r\nconvulsions of France with narrow selfishness. On the field of Jena,\r\ntwenty years after Frederick’s death, she paid the price of all her\r\nerrors (1806). Next year her Russian ally agreed with Napoleon that she\r\nshould lose half her land, forego the right to arm, and submit for the\r\nfuture to be hemmed in by four hostile States.\r\n\r\nPrussia was rescued from this plight by forces which found no place\r\nin Frederick’s system. Great ministers now gained ascendancy over\r\nthe King. The nation flung off the fetters of feudalism, all classes\r\njoined in the War of Liberation, and the final triumph in 1813–1815 was\r\ninspired by the spirit not of autocracy but of German nationality. The\r\nmemory of Frederick faded into that of a ruler of that old despotic\r\ntype which the sovereigns, in defiance of the claims of their people,\r\nwere striving to restore.\r\n\r\nIt was the spirit of nationality, however, that in the long run revived\r\nFrederick’s renown. The German people cried out for an organisation\r\nthat should be closer and more virile than the federation into which\r\nthey had been formed after the overthrow of Napoleon. In 1848–49, while\r\nAustria was paralysed by revolt, they turned hopefully to Prussia for\r\nleadership, but the reigning King refused to accept an Imperial crown\r\nat the hands of the mob. From that time onwards, however, the theory\r\ngained wide credence that it was the destiny of Prussia to unite and\r\nto regenerate Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1866 she worked her will with Austria, and when in 1871 the\r\nImperial crown was handed to her over the body of prostrate France, the\r\nHohenzollern legend grew. Results so glorious, men thought, could have\r\nbeen achieved only because a long series of national heroes had worked\r\ntowards a common goal. The Hohenzollerns, and Frederick chief among\r\nthem, were extolled by a thousand pens as the pioneers of a solid and\r\ntriumphant Germany. A generation which salutes by the title of “Great”\r\nthe Emperor whom Bismarck was wont to hoodwink and cajole is logically\r\ncompelled to regard Frederick as superhuman.\r\n\r\nThe student who reviews the life-work of Frederick without either the\r\nsympathy or the bias of German patriotism may return a calmer answer to\r\nthe question,—Is Frederick rightly termed “The Great”? Having followed\r\nthe main steps in his long career, we may at its close sift out and set\r\ndown those qualities and achievements, if such exist, which entitle\r\nhim not merely to a place among the great, but to a place in that\r\nsmall circle of the world’s heroes whose memory is so illustrious that\r\ngreatness is always coupled with their names.\r\n\r\nAs a thinker, Frederick falls very far short of greatness. Though he\r\nstruggled all his life with the problem of the World and its Maker,\r\nhe convinced himself only that nature furnished irresistible proof of\r\nan intelligent Creator, but that the idea of an act of creation was\r\nabsurd. In no department of thought was his range of vision long, but\r\nhe saw with wonderful clearness so far as his sight could penetrate.\r\nThe very fact that all objects within his ken seemed so distinct\r\nprevented him from realising that great forces might lie beyond.\r\nThus the method of progress which he followed was that of devising\r\ningenious improvements in a world that was settled and known. Though he\r\nwitnessed the American Revolution and died within three years of the\r\ngreat explosion in France, he seems to have had no suspicion that the\r\nframework of the world might change.\r\n\r\nThis lack of sympathy with the deeper currents of human progress\r\nreveals itself by many signs in almost all the phases of Frederick’s\r\nactivity. In the art of war, indeed, he had witnessed too great an\r\nadvance during his own career not to suppose that further advance was\r\npossible. He had himself given the infantry a mobility then unrivalled.\r\nHe had introduced horse-artillery, and created the finest cavalry in\r\nthe world. In his old age he turned to account the lessons of wars\r\nin both hemispheres, by raising his artillery to the importance of\r\na separate arm and experimenting with the straggling tactics of the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nLiterature and learning, however, he regarded with a less open\r\nmind. While Voltaire lived, he viewed him as the sole surviving man\r\nof letters. He treated the work of young Goethe, his own fervent\r\nadmirer, with contempt and showed himself no less blind to the latent\r\npossibilities of natural science and mathematics. What he saw clearly\r\nwas that these studies claimed much devotion, but sometimes failed to\r\nproduce practical results. “Is it not true,” he demanded of d’Alembert,\r\n“that electricity and all the miracles that it reveals have only\r\nserved to excite our curiosity? Is it not true that the forces of\r\nattraction and gravitation have only astonished our imagination? Is it\r\nnot true that all the operations of chemistry are in the same case?”\r\nEuler himself had failed to make the fountains at Sans Souci play\r\nsuccessfully, and the King jeered at geometricians as the very type\r\nof the pig-headed. In the campaign of 1778 an officer who trusted his\r\ntheodolite in preference to his eye was bidden to go to the devil with\r\nhis trigonometry.\r\n\r\nNone of Frederick’s opinions or whims can be termed unimportant, for\r\nhis power was so unfettered that he could embody any of them in acts\r\nof State. The building of the New Palace furnishes a hint of how\r\ngreat might have been the consequences had he given rein to a single\r\nenthusiasm in the sphere of art. But with this reservation it is in the\r\ndomain of statecraft, especially in his system of foreign policy, his\r\neconomic doctrine, and his theory of the organisation of the State,\r\nthat we must seek the true measure of his mind.\r\n\r\nIn his conception of the political world and of Prussia’s place in it,\r\nacuteness and lack of profundity are again apparent. The acuteness is\r\nindeed impaired because of the existence of two political factors,\r\nhonesty and women, that Frederick never understood. The former, it\r\nis true, was so rare that his ignorance of its nature hampered him\r\nbut little, save when Augustus frustrated all his plans in 1756, and\r\nwhen in the later stages of the Seven Years’ War Louis XV. fulfilled\r\nhis unprofitable engagements with the Queen. But during Frederick’s\r\nlifetime women played an unusually prominent part in Europe, and his\r\nmisjudgment of them was a serious political defect. Prussia suffered\r\nseverely for his belief that Maria Theresa was pliable, Elizabeth\r\nof Russia incapable, the Pompadour insignificant, and Catherine II.\r\nshallow.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, Frederick was as gifted a tactician in politics\r\nas in war, and in both he knew how to profit by experience. Compared\r\nwith his handling of France in his early years, his handling of\r\nRussia from 1762 to 1779 shows an advance as marked as that of his\r\nguardianship between Mollwitz and Leuthen. The circumstances of the age\r\nfavoured a policy of opportunism for Prussia. Dexterity, not depth, was\r\nprofitable, and Frederick therefore earned handsome rewards—Silesia,\r\nEast Frisia, and West-Preussen.\r\n\r\nThe pillars of his system, none the less, were built of crumbling\r\nstone. The triumphs of his successors have to this day shored up some\r\namong them—that profit ranks before promises in affairs of State, that\r\nmorals are to be reserved for manifestoes, and that the rectitude of\r\nan act is determined by its success. Some, on the other hand, were\r\nswiftly demolished by the course of subsequent events. That Austria\r\nwas Prussia’s most dangerous foe, that the German princes were her\r\nleast desirable allies, and that lasting concord with Russia was\r\nexpedient, may be regarded as mistakes, natural enough but damaging to\r\nFrederick’s reputation for profound statesmanship.\r\n\r\nHis economic errors have been discussed in earlier chapters of this\r\nbook. Where an original thinker would have reflected and enquired,\r\nFrederick plunged into ill-judged action. While he claimed for Prussia\r\na place among the Great Powers, he was bent on administering her\r\nresources as despotically as though she were a farm and he the steward.\r\nHis thrift and industry palliated but could not cure the evils which\r\nflowed from this confusion. The birth of individual enterprise was\r\nretarded, while by the concentration of its attention upon petty cash\r\nthe hereditary tendency of the Prussian Government to be sordid was\r\nintensified. The King, though admirably acquainted with the details\r\nof the production of material wealth, was insensible to the vastly\r\ngreater value of goods which cannot be seen or handled. How, it may\r\nbe wondered, could his Government foster honour, initiative, or\r\nindependence—qualities which in the long run are the fundamentals even\r\nof material success?\r\n\r\nIn foreign policy Frederick was successful, and in economic practice\r\nhis failure was qualified. But his lack of true insight into the\r\nfunctions of government was fraught with terrible consequences for\r\nPrussia. Judged by the standard of the age, it is true, Frederick’s\r\nadministration was a pattern to the world. The State, as the fashion\r\nthen was, interfered everywhere and with irresistible strength. Its\r\nmachinery, though cumbrous, ran smooth and true, and the actual\r\nexpense was small. “If Prussia perishes,” wrote Mirabeau, “the art of\r\ngovernment will return to its infancy.”\r\n\r\nFrom the same pen, however, came a verdict, damning, indeed, yet\r\nunshaken by appeal to reason or to the event. “If ever a foolish\r\nprince ascends this throne we shall see the formidable giant suddenly\r\ncollapse, and Prussia will fall like Sweden.” Frederick secured his own\r\ntriumph by making it impossible to succeed him.\r\n\r\nAgainst this department of his statecraft a double indictment must be\r\nbrought. He was not profound enough to see that the machine which he\r\nlaboured to render indissoluble was such that only an unbroken series\r\nof monarchs as gifted as he could guide it. Nor was he wise enough,\r\nthough he knew that the next steersman of the State would be a fool, to\r\nalter the machine so as to give it some power of self-direction.\r\n\r\nThe folly of tacitly assuming that successors like himself would be\r\nforthcoming was shared by Frederick with many of the great autocrats\r\nof history. Men abhor the thought of a vacuum created by their own\r\ndisappearance. The self-abnegation of a Washington is as much rarer as\r\nit is wiser than the augmented industry of an aged Louis XIV. Yet the\r\nsketch that has been given in this book of the all-embracing activity\r\nof the King, who nominated even the sergeants and corporals in an army\r\nof 200,000 men, and allowed no branch of his civil hierarchy the least\r\nreal independence, suffices to show how improbable it was that an\r\nordinary prince could put himself in Frederick’s place, and how fatal\r\nit would be to the Government if he did not.\r\n\r\nFrederick himself stated clearly the ruin that would ensue if a King\r\nof Prussia relaxed his grip on the finances, embarked upon schemes\r\nof premature aggression, or paused to enjoy his kingship. His nephew\r\nand heir, to look no further into the future, was a man whom he knew\r\nto be likely to commit all these faults. The remedy was to call into\r\nexistence a body outside the throne and to entrust to its keeping some\r\nshare in the power which had grown too great for the monarchy to wield.\r\nIn the bureaucracy Frederick possessed a body of loyal and upright\r\nmen who were not connected with any dangerous caste. Yet so far from\r\ntraining them for partial independence, he continued to treat them,\r\nfrom the General Directory downwards, like schoolboys who deserved\r\nto be flogged. His standing recipe was to keep them between fear and\r\nhope. In 1780, to cite only one instance from many, he wrote to the\r\nChamber for West-Preussen: “Ye are arch-rogues not worth the bread\r\nthat is given you, and all deserve to be turned out. Just wait till I\r\ncome to Preussen!” It is not surprising that men of birth and capacity\r\nhesitated to serve in the administration during Frederick’s lifetime\r\nand that narrow-minded pedantry soon became its distinguishing feature\r\nafter he died. The King bequeathed an impossible task to posterity and\r\nthe catastrophe of the Prussian State at Jena was the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK THE SECOND, KING OF PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PAINTING BY CHODOWIECKI.]\r\n\r\nAs a thinker, then, even in politics and administration, Frederick\r\nfalls very far short of greatness. His powers were, in reality,\r\nthose of a man of action. The versatility with which he entered into\r\nevery department of government in turn is no more astounding than\r\nthe clearness with which he perceived the immediate obstacles to be\r\novercome in each, the courage with which he faced them, and the force,\r\nswift, steady, and irresistible, by which he triumphed. The wonderful\r\nenergy which prompted him to bear on his own shoulders all the burden\r\nof the State in war and peace, and to put forth all his strength at\r\nevery blow, was yet more marvellous because it was susceptible of\r\ncontrol. Frederick, as we have seen, ceased from the labours of the\r\nSeven Years’ War, only to undertake the reconstruction of the economic\r\nlife of a great kingdom. By mere overflow of force he finished his\r\n_History of the War_ early in the year after that in which peace\r\nwas made. Yet, with all his energy, he was able to realise that not\r\nseldom force needs the help of time. He was gratified when some of his\r\nenterprises began to repay him after twenty years, and he declined to\r\naggrandise Prussia beyond the limit which his statesmanlike instinct\r\ntaught him that her strength would warrant.\r\n\r\nAmong Frederick’s powers, then, energy alone is truly great, but his\r\nenergy was such that to him few achievements were impossible. If we\r\nturn from his powers to his performance, we find his name associated\r\nwith three great phenomena of history. Under his guidance Prussia rose\r\nat one step from the third to the highest grade among the Powers.\r\nHe was, moreover, the pattern of the monarchs of his time, the type\r\nof the benevolent despots of the later eighteenth century. Finally,\r\nin the great series of events by which Germany has become a united\r\nmilitary Empire his life-work fills a conspicuous place. How far, we\r\nmay enquire, should his work in any of these three fields compel the\r\nadmiration of succeeding ages?\r\n\r\nThat part of the Hohenzollern legend which portrays Frederick as the\r\nconscious or semi-conscious architect of the modern German Empire finds\r\nlittle support in the record of his life. Sometimes, it is true, he\r\nused the language of Teutonic patriotism and posed as the indignant\r\ndefender of German liberties against the Hapsburg. But he posed with\r\nequal indignation as the protector of Polish or Swedish “liberties”\r\nagainst a reforming king or as the champion of Protestantism against\r\nPowers who might be represented as its foes. The whole course of his\r\nlife witnessed to his preference for French civilisation over German,\r\nand to his indifference as to the race of his subjects and assistants,\r\nif only they were serviceable to the State. His point of view was\r\ninvariably and exclusively Prussian. It would never have occurred to\r\nhim to refuse to barter his Rhenish provinces for parts of Bohemia or\r\nPoland because the former were inhabited by Germans and the latter by\r\nSlavs. He was far from being shocked at the suggestion that he might\r\none day partition the Empire with the Hapsburgs. He struggled for\r\nequality with Austria, never dreaming of the time when his descendants\r\nshould expel her from Germany and assume the Imperial crown. Thus,\r\nthough his work was a step towards their triumph, it was unconscious.\r\nHe must be judged by viewing his achievements in relation to his own\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s influence upon his contemporaries was enormous, and in\r\nmany respects it cannot be overpraised. He found what has been styled\r\n“Sultan and harem economy” prevalent among his peers, together with\r\na tendency to regard the income of the State as the pocket-money of\r\nthe ruler. For this he substituted in Europe a great measure of his\r\nown ideal of royal duty. Fearing nothing and hoping little from any\r\nfuture state, he was yet too proud to flinch from an atom of the\r\nlifelong penance that he believed was prescribed for kings by some law\r\nof nature. Duty to his House and duty to his State were to him the\r\nsame, and they dictated a life of incessant labour for his subjects’\r\ngood, and forbade the appropriation of more than a living wage. Other\r\nsovereigns followed the Prussian mode, and “benevolent despotism” came\r\nto be regarded as the panacea for the ills of Europe. Though it hardly\r\nsurvived the storm of the Revolution, it was instrumental in removing\r\nmany abuses and in promoting during several decades the comfort of\r\nthe common people. Thanks in great part to Frederick, irresponsible\r\nmonarchy became impossible for ever.\r\n\r\nFrederick’s fame, none the less, finds its most solid basis in the\r\nachievement to which all else in his life was subordinate,—the\r\nsuccessful aggrandisement of Prussia. Though it may be true that\r\nanother and a better way lay open to him, that the path which he\r\nmarked out led straight to Jena, that he owed much of his success to\r\nfortune, and that his work was rescued by forces which he had not\r\nprized, in spite of all it is to him that Prussia owes her place among\r\nthe nations. By his single will he shaped the course of history. His\r\nrule completed the fusion of provinces into a State, his victories\r\ngave it prestige, and the success of his work of aggrandisement was\r\ngreat enough to consecrate the very arts by which it was accomplished.\r\nTwo decades after his death a king of Prussia entered his tomb by\r\nnight, seeking inspiration to confront Napoleon. The architects of\r\nmodern Germany declare that all that they have built rests upon the\r\nfoundations that he laid. As long as the German Empire flourishes and\r\nthe world is swayed by the principles of its founders, so long will the\r\nfame of Frederick the Great remain secure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Agriculture, Prussian, 309 _ff._\r\n\r\n  Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen), 129;\r\n    Peace

distinctly\r\nindicated, and its picturesque and noteworthy periods and episodes are\r\npresented for the reader in their philosophical relation to each other\r\nas well as to universal history.\r\n\r\nIt is the plan of the writers of the different volumes to enter into\r\nthe real life of the peoples, and to bring them before the reader as\r\nthey actually lived, labored, and struggled—as they studied and wrote,\r\nand as they amused themselves. In carrying out this plan, the myths,\r\nwith which the history of all lands begins, will not be overlooked,\r\nthough these will be carefully distinguished from the actual history,\r\nso far as the labors of the accepted historical authorities have\r\nresulted in definite conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the different volumes have been planned to cover\r\nconnecting and, as far as possible, consecutive epochs or periods, so\r\nthat the set when completed will present in a comprehensive narrative\r\nthe chief events in the great STORY OF THE NATIONS; but it is, of\r\ncourse, not always practicable to issue the several volumes in their\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\n  Nos. 1–61, each                            $1.50\r\n  Half leather                                1.75\r\n  Nos. 62 and following Nos., each (by mail,  1.50\r\n                                         net  1.35\r\n  Half leather (by mail, $1.75)          net  1.60\r\n\r\n_For list of volumes see next page._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GREECE.
