The authenticity of the facts contained in the\r\nvarious articles is as absolute as the utmost care could make it. The\r\ndata have been procured from the best known authorities, and the\r\nsketches, when completed, have been subjected to the most searching\r\nexamination for verification and correction. That no errors will be\r\ndiscovered in this production, is too much to hope for; but we do\r\nmost certainly trust, that if any such errors there be, neither in\r\nnumber nor by their nature, will they be found to be sufficiently\r\nimportant to detract from that character for reliability, which it\r\nhas been our constant aim and endeavor to impart to this history.\r\n\r\nIn this new work the design has been, to make clear the development\r\nof ideas and institutions from epoch to epoch; the social and\r\neconomic conditions of the people have been preserved in the\r\nnarrative, and much attention has been paid to describing the civil\r\ncharacteristics of the several towns and cities, both in the conduct\r\nof their local affairs and also in relation to each other and the\r\ncounty at large.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that considerable prejudice exists among a\r\ngreat body of the people toward county histories in general, for the\r\nreason that some such compilations in the past, have been composed of\r\nfact and fiction so intermingled, as to render it a difficult matter\r\nto know what was true and what was false. It has been our object in\r\nthis work to hew straight to the line, satisfied to simply furnish\r\nsuch information as we were able to gather concerning each important\r\nmatter or interesting event; and where the desired materials were\r\nlacking, we have not attempted to supply that lack, by filling in the\r\nvacant niches with products of the imagination. We have not striven\r\nfor effect, but our object is merely to give an authentic account of\r\nfacts recent and remote, so disposed in a proper and orderly manner,\r\nas to enable our readers to clearly understand the history of their\r\ncounty from its origin down to the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is the limitation attached to all works devoted to general\r\nhistory, that from their very character only a superficial knowledge\r\nof the men and their times can be derived from them, while on the\r\nother hand, that which they lack is supplied by local histories of\r\nthis nature, whose great value in adding to the fund of human\r\nknowledge cannot be overestimated; for they are the only mediums\r\nthrough which we can get the whole story of the economy of life,\r\npracticed by those men and women in every county in our broad land,\r\nwhich eventually resulted in transforming a wilderness into a garden,\r\nand from a weak and needy folk, creating a rich and mighty nation. It\r\nhas long been recognized by every scholar, that the knowledge of such\r\nhumble elements is absolutely essential, in order that the mind may\r\nintelligently grasp the potent factors which go to make up history.\r\nHence, our correct understanding of the advancement and growth of a\r\npeople varies in just such proportion as the narrative of their daily\r\nlives is full or incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe history of our own county cannot be studied too often; for it is\r\none of great interest, and the record revealed is a proud one. There\r\nis no section of the country possessing more of historic interest,\r\nnor does one exist, as closely identified with those crucial events\r\nconnected with the formative period of the Republic. In this county\r\nwas held the last cantonment of the Revolutionary army, here\r\nWashington passed a large portion of his time, and within our borders\r\nhe rendered his greatest service to our country.\r\n\r\nAt the time the army went into winter quarters at Little Britain in\r\n1782, although peace was not declared until the following year, yet\r\nit was well understood that the long war was over and the States were\r\nat last independent of Great Britain. The knowledge of this fact\r\nnaturally inclined the minds of men to a consideration of the form of\r\ngovernment to be adopted for the infant commonwealth, and nowhere did\r\nthe matter receive more attention than in that encampment, and from\r\nthose soldiers whose deeds in arms had made the happy consummation\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe leisure entailed from the long relief from active duty which\r\nensued after going into camp, afforded ample opportunity for both the\r\nofficers and men of the army to discuss this question in all its\r\nbearings. It must be borne in mind that republics were not much in\r\nfavor at that period, while the incompetent and discreditable manner\r\nin which Congress had conducted the national affairs for years, had\r\ncreated profound distrust and widespread discontent. Under the\r\ncircumstances it is not so surprising that, believing nothing but\r\nchaos and ruin would be the lot of the country should the form of\r\ngovernment then in force be continued, the army should have finally\r\ndeclared for a limited monarchy, and desired Washington as king.\r\n\r\nThe deputation of Colonel Nicola to present the subject to Washington\r\ndoes not require repetition here, nor the details of the manner in\r\nwhich that great man resolutely put aside all feelings of personal\r\nambition, and so sternly repressed the movement for all time, that\r\nour present form of free government became an assured fact. These\r\nevents are merely mentioned to bring vividly to the mind the\r\nrecollection of the important connection our county sustained toward\r\nthat great drama, and also to bring clearly home the fact, that even\r\nthough the sun of liberty rose first from the green at Lexington or\r\nthe bridge at Concord, the gestation of the Republic occurred on the\r\nbanks of the Hudson in the old county of Orange.\r\n\r\nSome criticism of this work has been occasioned through the inclusion\r\ntherein of biographical sketches; but we are certain that upon calm\r\nreflection it will be seen that such objections rest upon no\r\nsubstantial foundation. The narratives of the lives of men and their\r\nacts constitute all there is of history. If it be true that all that\r\nour county shows in the way of growth and development, is entirely\r\ndue to the men and women who originally peopled this region, and\r\nworthily performed those parts allotted to them in the general scheme\r\nof life, during their existence here, it is equally true that their\r\nsuccessors who still abide with us, took up the burden where it fell\r\nfrom the hands of the fathers, and most signally continued the work,\r\nand carried it forward to success. If the works themselves are\r\ndeserving of commendation, surely the workers and finishers thereof\r\nare entitled to the honor of some mention.\r\n\r\nIn sending forth this volume, we trust that in addition to its value\r\nas a depository of accurate information and useful knowledge, it will\r\nalso prove an effective instrument in creating a more active public\r\nsentiment regarding historical subjects, and especially foster an\r\ninterest in the annals of our own county.\r\n\r\nThe editor would be wanting in gratitude did he fail to acknowledge\r\nhis obligations to the well-known writer, the late Mr. Edward M.\r\nRuttenber. The whole historical field comprising that period prior to\r\nthe Revolutionary era, has been so carefully gleaned over by that\r\nindefatigable and accurate historiographer, that there remains little\r\nor nothing that is new, to reward any subsequent investigator into\r\nthe history of that era, and therefore all who include that epoch in\r\nany sketch, must perforce draw largely from the store of valuable\r\nmaterials gathered by him. The editor also desires to return his\r\nsincere thanks to our numerous contributors, for their cheerful\r\nassistance, and especially for the painstaking care exhibited by them\r\nin the preparation of those articles which appear herein, and whose\r\nexcellence constitutes the chief merit of this work.\r\n\r\nThat the efforts of myself and associates have fallen short of the\r\nhigh standard we had set up for ourselves at the inception of our\r\nlabors, we are well aware; but we do at least claim, that we have in\r\nsome material degree, contributed in this volume to the \"rescuing\r\nfrom oblivion and preserving the services which others have performed\r\nfor God and country and fellow men.\" If the public by its verdict\r\nallows this claim to stand, our reward will be ample and we shall\r\nrest well content.\r\n\r\n Russel Headley.\r\n\r\n Dated, July 14, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Part I\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I-X\r\n The County of Orange\r\n\r\n CHAPTER XI.\r\n The Town of Blooming Grove . . . . . .

It was also one of those\r\nformed by a general act of organization in 1788, when it included the\r\npresent county of Rockland, and was described as extending from the\r\nlimits of East and West Jersey on the west side of the Hudson River\r\nalong the river to Murderer's Creek, or the bounds of Ulster County,\r\nand westward into the woods as far as Delaware River--that is, all\r\nthat part of the state south of an easterly and westerly line from\r\nthe mouth of Murderer's Creek to the Delaware River or northerly line\r\nof Pennsylvania. In 1797 Rockland county was set off from it, and\r\nfive towns from Ulster were added. Its boundaries were definitely\r\nfixed by an act of the New York legislature adopted April 3rd, 1801.\r\nThe previous act of April 5th, 1797, provided that five towns, then a\r\npart of the County of Ulster, should be annexed to the county of\r\nOrange, and that the courts should hold their sessions alternately at\r\nNewburgh and Goshen. Two days afterward another act was passed\r\ndefining the boundary lines of the towns composing the newly\r\nconstructed county, and naming them as follows: Blooming Grove,\r\nChesekook, Deer Park, Goshen, Minisink, Montgomery, New Windsor,\r\nNewburgh, Wallkill and Warwick. There were subsequent changes, and\r\nthe following is a list of the present towns, with the years of their\r\nerection, and the territories from which they were taken:\r\n\r\nBlooming Grove, 1799, taken from Cornwall; Cornwall, 1788, as New\r\nCornwall, and changed to Cornwall in 1797; Chester, 1845, taken from\r\nGoshen, Warwick, Monroe and Blooming Grove; Crawford, 1823, taken\r\nfrom Montgomery; Deer Park, 1798, as a part of Ulster County and\r\ntaken from Mamakating; Goshen, 1788; Hamptonburgh, 1830, taken from\r\nWallkill, Goshen, Montgomery, Blooming Grove and New Windsor; Monroe,\r\n1799, taken from Cornwall, original name Chesekook, changed to\r\nSouthfield in 1802, and to Monroe in 1808, and divided in 1890 into\r\nWoodbury and Tuxedo; Montgomery, 1788; Mount Hope, 1825, taken from\r\nWallkill, Deer Park and Minisink, original name Calhoun; Newburgh,\r\n1788; New Windsor, 1788; Wallkill, 1788; Minisink, 1788.\r\n\r\nThere are three cities in Orange County, Newburgh in the town of\r\nNewburgh; Middletown, in the town of Wallkill, and Port Jervis, in\r\nthe town of Deer Park. Newburgh was chartered as a city in 1865,\r\nMiddletown in 1888, and Port Jervis in 1907.\r\n\r\nThe irregular county thus constituted is bounded on the northwest and\r\nnorth by Sullivan and Ulster Counties, on the east and southeast by\r\nthe Hudson River and Rockland County, on the southwest and west by\r\nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania and Sullivan County. It has nearly half a\r\nmillion square miles.\r\n\r\nThe towns along the northwestern and northern border are Deer Park,\r\nMount Hope, Wallkill, Crawford, Montgomery and Newburgh.\r\n\r\nAlong the Hudson are Newburgh, New Windsor, Cornwall and Highlands.\r\n\r\nNext to Rockland County are Highlands, Woodbury and Tuxedo.\r\n\r\nOn the New Jersey line are the point of Tuxedo, Warwick, Minisink,\r\nGreenville, and a section of Deer Park.\r\n\r\nThe most western town is Deer Park which lies along New Jersey, the\r\nDelaware River and Pennsylvania on the southwest and Sullivan County\r\non the north.\r\n\r\nIn the interior are the towns of Wawayanda, Goshen, Hamptonburgh,\r\nBlooming Grove, Chester and Monroe.\r\n\r\nThe post offices of the county as distributed in the several towns\r\nare named as follows:\r\n\r\nBlooming Grove: Salisbury's Mills, Washingtonville, Blooming Grove,\r\nOxford Depot, Craigsville.\r\n\r\nChester: Chester, Greycourt, Sugar Loaf.\r\n\r\nCornwall: Cornwall, Cornwall-on-Hudson, Cornwall Landing, Idlewild,\r\nMountainville, Orrs Mills, Meadowbrook, Firthcliffe.\r\n\r\nCrawford: Bullville, Pine Bush, Thompson Ridge.\r\n\r\nDeer Park: Cuddebackville, Godeffroy, Huguenot, Port Jervis, Rio,\r\nSparrowbush.\r\n\r\nGoshen: Goshen.\r\n\r\nGreenville: Greenville.\r\n\r\nHamptonburgh: Campbell Hall, Burnside.\r\n\r\nHighlands: Highland Falls, Fort Montgomery, West Point.\r\n\r\nMiddletown: Middletown.\r\n\r\nMinisink: Minisink, Johnson, Westtown, Unionville.\r\n\r\nMonroe: Monroe, Turner.\r\n\r\nMontgomery: Walden, Montgomery, Maybrook.\r\n\r\nMount Hope: Otisville, Guymard.\r\n\r\nNewburgh: Newburgh, Middle Hope, Liptondale. Cedarcliff, Cronomer\r\nValley, Savilton, Orange Lake, Roseton.\r\n\r\nNew Windsor: Little Britain, Rocklet, Vail's Gate, Moodna.\r\n\r\nTuxedo: Arden, Southfields, Tuxedo Park.\r\n\r\nWallkill: Middletown, Circleville, Stony Ford, Howells, Crystalrun,\r\nFair Oaks.\r\n\r\nWarwick: Edenville, Warwick, Florida, Pine Island, New Milford,\r\nWisner Lake, Bellvale, Greenwood Lake, Amity.\r\n\r\nWawayanda: New Hampton, Ridgebury, Slate Hill, South Centreville.\r\n\r\nWoodbury: Woodbury Falls, Highland Mills, Central Valley.\r\n\r\nTo go back and particularize more fully: In 1686 the town of Orange\r\nwas organized, and soon afterward adjoining patents were attached to\r\nit for jurisdiction and assessment. In 1719 the northern settlements\r\nwere separated into the precinct of Orange, with Tappan as its\r\ncenter, and the precinct of Haverstraw, with \"the Christian patented\r\nlands of Haverstraw\" as its center. In 1714 the precinct of Goshen\r\nwas organized, and included the entire county except the Orangetown\r\nand Haverstraw districts. In 1764 it was divided by a straight line,\r\nall the lands west of the line constituting the precinct of Goshen\r\nand all the lands east, the precinct of New Cornwall. The four\r\nprecincts named were the political divisions of the county until\r\nafter the Revolution. In 1788 the towns of Warwick and Minisink were\r\nerected from Goshen, and in 1791 the towns of Clarkstown and Ramapo\r\nwere erected from Haverstraw. In 1797 the name of the town of New\r\nCornwall was changed to Cornwall.\r\n\r\nIn the southern towns of the County of Ulster, afterward transferred\r\nto Orange, changes were made in 1709. The precincts of Highlands and\r\nShawangunk were attached to New Paltz, and the present Orange County\r\ntowns of Montgomery, Crawford and Wallkill were then embraced within\r\nits limits. These divisions continued until 1743, when they were\r\nchanged to three precincts--Wallkill, Shawangunk and Highlands. There\r\nwas also the precinct of Mamakating west of the precincts of Wallkill\r\nand Shawangunk, the northern part of which was made a part of Deer\r\nPark in 1798 by the law annexing the Ulster County towns. In 1762 the\r\nprecinct of Highlands was divided into the precincts of Newburgh and\r\nNew Windsor, and in 1772 the precinct of Newburgh was divided so as\r\nto form another precinct on the north, named New Marlborough. The\r\nsame law divided the precinct of Wallkill so that its northern\r\nsection became the precinct of Hanover. In 1782 the name of this\r\nprecinct was changed to Montgomery by permission of the Provincial\r\nConvention of the State. By the general act of 1788 the Ulster County\r\nprecincts which have been named were erected into the towns of\r\nNewburgh, New Windsor, New Marlborough, Shawangunk and Montgomery.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1797, after much opposition to plans for changing\r\nthe boundaries of Orange and Ulster Counties, two bills were agreed\r\nupon by a Convention of Delegates from the several towns interested,\r\nand these were presented to the Legislature and passed. One of them\r\nset off from Orange the present County of Rockland, and the other\r\nannexed to Orange County the towns of New Windsor, Newburgh,\r\nWallkill, Montgomery and Deer Park, then the southern section of the\r\ncounty of Ulster.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 a general law dividing the State into counties fixed the\r\nthen somewhat undefined boundaries of Orange, and another law adopted\r\nthe same year fixed the boundaries of its towns as they now are, with\r\nthe exception of Woodbury and Tuxedo, into which Monroe was separated\r\nin 1890.\r\n\r\nThe first Board of Supervisors of the present county, which met in\r\nGoshen in 1798, was composed as follows: John Vail, Goshen; Francis\r\nCrawford, New Windsor; Reuben Tooker, Newburgh; Anselem Helme,\r\nCornwall; Jacob Post, Warwick; Nathan Arnont, Minisink; James Finch,\r\nDeer Park; David Gallatin, Montgomery; Andrew McCord, Wallkill.\r\n\r\nSince that time the three towns of Greenville, Wawayanda and\r\nHighlands have been erected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington's Headquarters, Newburgh]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER II.\r\n EARLY INDIAN CHARACTER AND CONDUCT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the surprises experienced by Columbus and the explorers who\r\nsailed up and down the coast of North America soon after his great\r\ndiscovery, were the characteristics of the newly-found race of native\r\nIndians. Their tribal differences were comparatively slight, and\r\nalthough uncivilized, many of them exhibited traits which indicated a\r\nremote ancestry above savagery, and caused speculation which has not\r\nyet ceased.\r\n\r\nHendrick Hudson, from whom the magnificent Hudson River takes its\r\nname, has given us in his journal the first information about the\r\ntribes at its mouth and along its shores. Sailing from Amsterdam in\r\nthe ship _Half-Moon_ in 1609, he first landed near Portland, [fn] Me.,\r\non July 19th. Thence he sailed south to Chesapeake Bay, thence north\r\nto Delaware Bay, and thence to Sandy Hook, anchoring, probably off\r\nConey Island, September 3d. Here and on the New Jersey coast Indians\r\ncame to the ship in canoes, and bartered green corn and dried currants\r\nfor knives, beads and articles of clothing. He wrote that they behaved\r\nwell, but when he sent out a boat on the 6th to explore the Narrows,\r\nhis men were attacked by twenty-six natives in two canoes, who killed\r\none of his crew with an arrow and wounded two others. On September\r\n11th he sailed through the Narrows and found a good protected harbor.\r\nHere his ship was again visited by many natives, who brought Indian\r\ncorn, tobacco and oysters for barter, and displayed copper pipes,\r\ncopper ornaments, and earthen pots for cooking.\r\n\r\n  [fn] To avoid circumlocution present names will be generally used to\r\n  indicate localities.\r\n\r\nHudson started on his voyage up the river September 12th, and began\r\nhis return September 22d. His ship stopped near the present city of\r\nHudson, but he proceeded much farther in a small boat--as far, it is\r\nsupposed, as Albany. About 25 miles below Albany an aged chief\r\nentertained him hospitably, and the Indians offered in barter tobacco\r\nand beaver skins. Here the Indians of the Hudson, and probably of all\r\nNorth America, first tested the white man's liquor. Hudson gave them\r\nsome to see how they would act under its influence. Only one drank\r\nenough to become intoxicated, and when he fell down in a stupor the\r\nothers were alarmed, but after he became sober the next day their\r\nalarm ceased, and they manifested a friendly spirit. This was on the\r\neast side of the river. Below the Highlands on the west side the\r\nnatives were of a different disposition, and shot arrows at the crew\r\nfrom points of land. For this they were punished by Hudson's men, who\r\nreturned their fire and killed about a dozen of them. Hudson's\r\njournal says that above the Highlands \"they found a very loving\r\npeople and very old men, and were well used.\" One of his anchoring\r\nplaces had been the bay at Newburgh, and here he wrote prophetically:\r\n\"This is a very pleasant place to build a town on,\" and the handsome\r\nand prosperous City of Newburgh shows that he judged well. At this\r\npoint many more Indians boarded the ship, and did a brisk business in\r\nexchanging skins for knives and ornamental trifles.\r\n\r\nAt several anchorages the Indians brought green corn to Hudson's\r\nship, and it was one of the agreeable surprises of the crew at their\r\nmeals. Corn was generally cultivated by the Hudson River tribes, and\r\ngrew luxuriantly. Ruttenber says it was long supposed to be native,\r\nbut investigation shows it was transplanted from a foreign shore. It\r\nis certain that the early explorers knew nothing of it until it was\r\nbrought to them by the Indians, and that it had been cultivated by\r\nthe latter from immemorial times.\r\n\r\nHudson wrote that some of the Indians whom he met along the river\r\nwore mantles of feathers and good furs, and that women came to the\r\nship with hemp, having red copper tobacco pipes and copper neck\r\nornaments. Verrazano, who sailed along the North American coast 33\r\nyears after Hudson's expedition, said the Indians were dressed out in\r\nfeathers of birds of various colors. He mentioned \"two kings\" who\r\ncame aboard his ship in Narragansett Bay as \"more beautiful in\r\nstature than can possibly be described,\" and characterized them as\r\ntypes of their race. One wore a deerskin around his body artificially\r\nwrought in damask colors. His hair was tied back in knots, and around\r\nhis neck was a chain with stones of different colors. The natives who\r\naccompanied the chiefs were of middle stature, broad across the\r\nbreast, strong in the arms and well formed. A little later Roger\r\nWilliams was welcomed as a friend by an old chief, Canonnieus, and\r\nhis nephew, and he described the Indians who accompanied them as of\r\nlarger size than the whites, with tawny complexions, sharp faces,\r\nblack hair, and mild, pleasant expressions. The women were graceful\r\nand beautiful, with fine countenances, and of modest appearance and\r\nmanner. They wore no clothing, except ornamental deer skins, like\r\nthose of the men, but some had rich lynx skins on their arms, and\r\nvarious ornaments on their heads composed of braids of hair which\r\nhung upon their breasts. These Indians were generous in their\r\ndisposition, \"giving away whatever they had.\"\r\n\r\nLater the Indians were classed from language into two general\r\ndivisions--the Algonquins and the Iroquois--terms given them by the\r\nJesuit missionaries. The Iroquois occupied central and western New\r\nYork, including the Mohawk River, the headwaters of the Delaware, the\r\nGreat Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. The Algonquins included all\r\nthe Indians of Eastern New York, Eastern Canada, New England, New\r\nJersey, Eastern Pennsylvania, and Eastern Virginia. Several tribes in\r\nthe west Hudson River counties constituted the Lenni-Lenape nation,\r\nwhich held its council fires on the site of Philadelphia. Some of\r\ntheir names were Waoranecks, Haverstroos, Minisinks and\r\nWaranawonkongs. When Hudson came the Lenapes were the head of the\r\nAlgonquin nations, but wars with the Iroquois and the whites so\r\nweakened them that they became the subjects of the Iroquois\r\nconfederacy for eighty years previous to 1755. Then they rebelled,\r\nallied themselves with other tribes, became the head of the western\r\nnations and successfully contested nearly all the territory west of\r\nthe Mississippi. During the period of their subservience they were\r\nknown as the Delawares. The Mohawks were the most eastern nation of\r\nthe Iroquois, and were called Maquas by the Dutch, and a branch on\r\nthe Delaware, Minquas. The Iroquois, first known as the Five Nations,\r\nlater received the Tuscaroras of North Carolina, who removed to New\r\nYork, and with the Cherokees and other southern Indians became the\r\nsixth nation of that great Indian confederacy, to which they also\r\nwere related by language.\r\n\r\nBoth the Algonquin and Iroquois confederacies were divided into\r\ntribes and sub-tribes of families, each with a head who was the\r\nfather or founder. These combined for mutual defense and the heads\r\nelected one of their number chief sachem, regarding themselves as a\r\nnation to make laws, negotiate treaties, and engage in wars, the wars\r\nbeing mostly between the Algonquins and Iroquois.\r\n\r\nThe Esopus Indians occupied parts of Orange and Ulster Counties, and\r\ntheir war dances were held on the Dans Kamer, a high promontory\r\nnorth of Newburgh. Their rule extended to other families east and\r\nwest of the Hudson, but their territory cannot be clearly defined.\r\n\r\nRegarding Indian character, there have been presented by our\r\nhistorians some contrasting but not wholly irreconcilable views.\r\nE. M. Ruttenber, in his valuable contribution to the History of\r\nUlster County, edited by Hon. A. T. Clearwater, says:\r\n\r\n\"When they were discovered the race had wrought out unaided a\r\ndevelopment far in advance of any of the old barbaric races of\r\nEurope. They were still in the age of stone, but entering upon the\r\nage of iron. Their implements were mainly of stone and flint and\r\nbone, yet they had learned the art of making copper pipes and\r\nornaments. This would rank their civilization about with that of the\r\nGermans in the days of Tacitus (about the year 200 A.D.). They had,\r\nunaided by the civilization of Europe, made great progress. They had\r\nlearned to weave cloth out of wild hemp and other grasses, and to\r\nextract dyes from vegetable substances; how to make earthen pots and\r\nkettles; how to make large water casks from the bark of trees, as\r\nwell as the lightest and fleetest canoes; had passed from the cave\r\nto the dwelling house; had established the family relation and\r\ndemocratic forms of government; their wives were the most faithful,\r\ntheir young women the most brilliant in paint and garments and robes\r\nof furs; they carved figures on stone, and wrote the story of their\r\nlives in hieroglyphics, of which some of the finest specimens in\r\nAmerica are preserved in the senate house in Kingston; and most\r\nremarkable of all, and that which carries back their chronology to a\r\nperiod that cannot be defined, they had developed spoken languages\r\nthat were rich in grammatical forms, differing radically from any of\r\nthe ancient and modern languages of the old hemisphere, languages\r\nwhich were surely ingenious, and of which it was said by the most\r\nexpert philologists of Europe that they were among 'the most\r\nexpressive languages, dead or living.' . . . They were savages or\r\nbarbarians, as you may please to call them, men who wrote their\r\nvengeance in many scenes of blood, the recital of which around the\r\nfiresides of the pioneers became more terrifying by repetition;\r\nnevertheless they were representatives of a race whose civilization,\r\nthough it was 1200 years behind our own, had no faults greater than\r\nwere found in the races from which we boast our lineage.\"\r\n\r\nIn Samuel Eager's \"History of Orange County,\" published in 1846-7,\r\nare found statements presenting a different conception of Indian\r\nqualities. It says:\r\n\r\n\"The Indian character in this State is well known, and we have no\r\nreason to believe that the character of the Indians of Orange was\r\nmaterially different. If you know one you know the general character\r\nof those who compose his wigwam, and knowing this you know that of\r\nhis tribe. They are all alike--dirty, slothful and indolent,\r\ntrustworthy and confiding in their friendships, while fierce and\r\nrevengeful under other circumstances. Their good will and enmity are\r\nalike easily purchased. All have the war dance before starting upon\r\nand after returning from the warpath, and bury the dead standing,\r\nwith their instruments. Their known rule of warfare is an\r\nindiscriminate massacre of men, women and children, and they are\r\ncruel to their captives, whom they usually slay with the tomahawk or\r\nburn up at the stake. They believe in a future state of rewards and\r\npunishments, and sacrifice to a Good Spirit--an unknown god. We have\r\nthe testimony of Hendrick Hudson that the Indians above the Highlands\r\nwere kind and friendly to him and his crew, and the more so the\r\nfurther they proceeded up the river. This, we presume, related to\r\nthose on both sides of the river, though below the Highlands they\r\nwere of a more hostile character. We have understood, as coming from\r\nthe early settlers, who first located in Westchester and Dutchess and\r\nafterwards removed here, as many of them did, that the impression was\r\nvery general that the Indians on that side of the river were less\r\nhostile and more friendly to the white settlers than those on the\r\nwest; and this was given as a reason for settling there, which\r\naccounts in some measure for the earlier settlement of that side of\r\nthe river. We infer, from the absence of written accounts of\r\nanything very peculiar or different in the habits and customs of the\r\nIndians of the county from others in the State, and from the poverty\r\nof tradition in this respect that there were no such peculiar\r\ndifferences, but they were similar and identical with those of the\r\nheathen Indians at Onondaga and Buffalo before modified and changed\r\nby white association.\"\r\n\r\nThese somewhat contradictory views of the Indian race seem to be\r\na little too sweeping on both sides, they being neither so good nor\r\nso bad as represented. The native Indians have been both kind and\r\ncruel to one another and the whites. Their instincts are not unlike\r\nthose of civilized peoples, but there are less control and restraint\r\nin savagery than civilization. Their tribal differences of conduct\r\ntowards the whites depended less upon natural disposition than\r\nleadership and provocations. Vindictiveness towards real or fancied\r\nenemies seems to have prevailed everywhere among the North American\r\ntribes, and this was undoubtedly increased towards the whites by the\r\nlatter's aggressions and by the former's indulgence in the\r\nintoxicants furnished them by their white neighbors. But cruelty is\r\ningrained in the barbarian character almost everywhere, and often is\r\nmanifested in communities called civilized. The tortures of the\r\nmiddle ages in the name of religion were as painful as those\r\ninflicted in the eighteenth century by our Indians, and both seem\r\nalmost impossible to the philanthropist of to-day. Not until minds\r\nhave been softened by such teachings as those of the Founder of\r\nChristianity, and extremes of bigotry have given place to tolerance\r\nand charity, is the natural disposition of the average man to give\r\npain to antagonists dissipated.\r\n\r\nThere has been no more intellectual nation among the aborigines of\r\nAmerica than the Senecas of Western New York--the most original and\r\ndetermined of the confederated Iroquois--but its warriors were cruel\r\nlike the others, and their squaws often assisted the men in torturing\r\ntheir captives. When Boyd and Parker were captured in the Genesee\r\nValley in the Sullivan campaign of 1779, Brant, the famous half-breed\r\nchief, assured them that they would not be injured, yet left them in\r\nthe hands of Little Beard, another chief, to do with as he would, and\r\nthe prolonged tortures to which he and his savage companions\r\nsubjected them were horrible. After they had been stripped and tied\r\nto trees, and tomahawks were thrown so as to just graze their heads,\r\nParker was unintentionally hit so that his head was severed from his\r\nbody, but Boyd was made to suffer lingering miseries. His ears were\r\ncut off, his mouth enlarged with knives and his severed nose thrust\r\ninto it, pieces of flesh were cut from his shoulders and other parts\r\nof his body, an incision was made in his abdomen and an intestine\r\nfastened to the tree, when he was scourged to make him move around\r\nit, and finally as he neared death, was decapitated, and his head\r\nraised on a pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John G. Borden]\r\n\r\nSimilar tortures were not uncommon among both the Iroquois and\r\nAlgonquins when they made captives of the whites.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Lenni-Lenape of the Hudson River's western lands,\r\nthere is in Eager's history an account by a Delaware Indian of the\r\nreception and welcome by the Indians of the first Europeans who came\r\nto their country--on York Island--which is here condensed.\r\n\r\nSome Indians out fishing at a place where the sea widens saw\r\nsomething remarkably large floating on the water at a great distance,\r\nwhich caused much wondering speculation among them. The sight caused\r\ngreat excitement, and as it approached news was sent to scattered\r\nchiefs. They fancied that it was a great house in which the Mannitto\r\n(Great Spirit) was coming to visit them. Meat for sacrifices and\r\nvictuals were prepared. Conjurers were set to work, and runners were\r\nsent out. The latter soon reported that it was a great house full of\r\nhuman beings. When it came near it stopped, and a canoe came from it\r\ncontaining men, one elegantly dressed in red. This man saluted them\r\nwith a friendly countenance, and, lost in admiration, the Indians\r\nreturned his salute. They saw that he glittered with gold lace and\r\nhad a white skin. He poured something from a gourd into a cup, drank\r\nfrom it, filled it again, and handed it to a chief. It is passed\r\naround, and the chiefs smell of it, but do not drink. At last a\r\nresolute chief jumps up and harangues the others, saying that they\r\nought to drink, as the Mannitto had done, and he would dare to drink,\r\nalthough it might kill him, as it was better that one man should be\r\ndestroyed than that a whole nation should die. Then he drank, soon\r\nbegan to stagger, and finally fell to the ground. He fell asleep, and\r\nhis companions thinking that he was dead, began to bemoan his fate.\r\nBut he awoke, and declared that he had never before felt so happy as\r\nwhen he drank from the white man's cup. He asked for more, which was\r\ngiven him, and the whole assembly imitated him and became\r\nintoxicated. After they became sober they were given presents of\r\nbeads, axes, hoes and stockings. Then the Dutch made them understand\r\nthat they would not stay, but would come again in a year, bring more\r\npresents, and would then want a little land. They returned the next\r\nseason, began cultivating the grounds and kept bargaining for more\r\nland until the Indians began to believe that they would soon want all\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe scenes thus described by the Delaware Indian were probably soon\r\nafter the voyage of discovery by Hendrick Hudson.\r\n\r\nThe Esopus Indians, according to early records, represented four\r\nsub-tribes--the Amangaricken, Kettyspowy, Mahon and Katatawis. In\r\n1677 their chief deeded a large tract of land lying along the Hudson\r\nin Ulster and Orange Counties and extending back to the Rochester\r\nhills, to the English Government. The tract cannot be clearly\r\ndefined. Previous negotiations and fighting led to this transfer. In\r\n1663 Wildwijk (Kingston), where an infant colony had been started,\r\nwas set on fire, and the colonists were attacked and murdered in\r\ntheir homes with axes, tomahawks and guns. They finally rallied and\r\ndrove the Indians away, but not until twenty-five of them had been\r\nkilled and forty-five made prisoners. The New Village, as it was\r\ncalled, was annihilated, and of the Old Village twelve houses were\r\nburned. When Peter Stuyvesant heard of the calamity he sent a company\r\nof soldiers from New Amsterdam to assist the settlers. They were\r\ncommanded by Captain Martin Kregier, arrived at Wildwijk July 4, and\r\na few days afterward Kregier had a conference with five Mohawk and\r\nMohican chiefs who came from Fort Orange. He induced them to release\r\nsome of their captives, but his negotiations with the Warranawonkongs\r\nwere less successful. They were the proprietors of lands in the\r\nvicinity of Newburgh, and for some distance above and below the\r\nLenni-Lenape confederacy. They would not agree to terms of peace\r\nunless the Dutch would pay for the land called the Groot Plat or\r\nGreat Plot and add presents within ten days. Kregier would not agree\r\nto this, and on July 25th followed them to their castle. They\r\nabandoned it, and fled to the Shawangunk Mountains, taking their\r\ncaptives with them. They were followed, and again retreated. Kregier\r\nburned their palisaded castle, cut down their cornfields and\r\ndestroyed about a hundred pits full of corn and beans which were a\r\npart of the harvest of the previous year. Then Kregier returned to\r\nWildwijk and guarded the settlers while they harvested their grain.\r\nHe resumed offensive operations in September, sending out about fifty\r\nmen to reduce a new castle which the Indians were building \"about\r\nfour hours beyond the one burned.\" The Indians were surprised, but\r\nfought fiercely as they retreated, killing and wounding three of the\r\nDutch soldiers. Thirteen Indians were taken prisoners and\r\ntwenty-three Dutch captives released. The Indians fled to the\r\nmountains, the uncompleted fort was destroyed, and the soldiers\r\ncarried away much spoil. Another force was sent to the same place\r\nOctober 1st, when the Indians retreated southward, and the Dutch\r\ncompleted the work of destruction, including crops and wigwams around\r\nthe fort. Later the Indians solicited peace and an armistice was\r\ngranted. They had suffered severely, and felt crushed, and their\r\nallies, the Waoranecks, were also subdued, although their territory\r\nhad not been invaded. \"The embers of their forest worship, which had\r\nfor ages been lighted on the Dans Kamer, were extinguished forever.\"\r\nIn the following May of 1664 they sought and executed a treaty with\r\nthe Dutch at Fort Amsterdam, whereby the lands claimed and conquered\r\nby the Dutch were to remain the property of the conquerors, and the\r\nIndians were not to approach the Dutch settlements with arms. The\r\nratification of the treaty was celebrated, and thus was closed the\r\nstruggle of the Indians for the possession of their lands on the\r\nwestern slope of the Hudson from the Catskills to the ocean. The\r\nMinsis remained in the western part of Orange and some adjoining\r\nterritory, and in 1692 and 1694 were strengthened by additions of\r\nlarge colonies of Shawanoes. For nearly a hundred years after the\r\ntreaty there was but little trouble between the Indians and the\r\nsettlers of Orange County.\r\n\r\nThe incursions during the French and Indian and the Revolutionary\r\nWars properly belong to the military chapter of this history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER III.\r\n FIRST SETTLEMENTS AND SETTLERS.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition, supported by some evidence, that the first\r\nsettlement of Orange County was in the old Minisink territory along\r\nthe Delaware River. Although the supposed settlement was mostly in\r\nPennsylvania, the reported excavations, roads and other work of the\r\nsettlers were mostly in Orange County. The story of the tradition,\r\nand evidence that it has a basis of fact, are given in a letter by\r\nSamuel Preston, Esq., dated Stockport, June 6, 1828, which is\r\npublished in Samuel W. Eager's county history of 1846-7, and\r\nreproduced in Charles E. Stickney's history of the Minisink region of\r\n1867. Eager says the letter \"will throw light upon the point of early\r\nsettlement in the Minisink country,\" and Stickney assumes that its\r\nsecond-hand statements are substantially true. But Ruttenber and\r\nClark's more complete history of the county, published in 1881,\r\ndiscredits them. The essential parts of Preston's letter are here\r\ncondensed.\r\n\r\nHe was deputed by John Lukens, surveyor general, to go into\r\nNorthampton County on his first surveying tour, and received from\r\nhim, by way of instruction, a narrative respecting the settlements of\r\nMinisink on the Delaware above the Kittany and Blue Mountain. This\r\nstated that John Lukens and Nicholas Scull--the latter a famous\r\nsurveyor, and the former his apprentice--were sent to the Minisink\r\nregion in 1730 for the government of Philadelphia; that the Minisink\r\nflats were then all settled by Hollanders; that they found there a\r\ngrove of apple trees much larger than any near Philadelphia, and that\r\nthey came to the conclusion that the first settlement of Hollanders\r\nin Minisink was many years older than William Penn's charter. Samuel\r\nDepuis, who was living there, told them that there was a good road to\r\nEsopus, near Kingston, about a hundred miles from the Mine holes,\r\nwhich was called the Mine road. Preston was charged by Lukens to\r\nlearn more particulars about this Mine road, and obtained some from\r\nNicholas Depuis, son of Samuel, who was living in great affluence in\r\na spacious stone house. He had known the Mine road well, and before a\r\nboat channel was opened to Foul Rift, used to drive on it several\r\ntimes every winter with loads of wheat and cider to buy salt and\r\nother necessaries, as did also his neighbors. He repeated stories\r\nwithout dates that he had heard from older people. They said that in\r\nsome former age a company of miners came there from Holland; that\r\nthey worked two mines, and were very rich; that they built the Mine\r\nroad with great labor, and hauled their ore over it; that they bought\r\nthe improvements of the native Indians, the most of whom moved to the\r\nSusquehanna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Colonel Ellison House, New Windsor]\r\n\r\nIn 1789 Preston began to build a house in the Minisink and obtained\r\nmore evidence from Gen. James Clinton, the father of Gov. Dewitt\r\nClinton, and Christopher Tappan, Recorder of Ulster County, who came\r\nthere on a surveying expedition. They both knew the Mine holes and the\r\nMine road, and were of the opinion that they were worked while New\r\nYork belonged to Holland, which was previous to 1664. Preston did not\r\nlearn what kind of ore the mines produced, but concluded that it was\r\nsilver. He went to the Paaquarry Mine holes, and found the mouths caved\r\nfull and overgrown with bushes, but giving evidence of a great deal\r\nof labor done there in some former time.\r\n\r\nRuttenber and Clark's history, as stated, discredit the tradition\r\nregarding the early settlement of the Minisink by Hollanders, as\r\naccepted by Clinton, Tappan, Depuis, Preston and others. It\r\nrepresents the Mine road to be simply an enlargement of an old Indian\r\ntrail, and the mines to have been of copper and located in what is\r\nnow the town of Warren, Sussex County, N. J. It says that the Dutch at\r\nEsopus during the war of 1660-63 had little knowledge of the country,\r\neven east of the Shawangunk, and that if the Minisink was penetrated\r\nat a much earlier period it was by way of the Delaware River. The\r\nhistorian discusses the subject further, and concludes that the first\r\nsettler of the Minisink was William Tietsort, a blacksmith from\r\nSchenectady, who barely escaped the slaughter at that place in 1689,\r\nand went to the Minisink country from Esopus, by invitation of\r\nfriendly Indians, and purchased lands of them in October, 1689.\r\n\"There is little doubt that he was the first settler on the western\r\nborder,\" says the history.\r\n\r\nBut Stickney, after recapitulating the traditions and evidence of the\r\nearly settlement of the region, says: \"Here generations lived the\r\nfleeting span of life in blissful ignorance of any outer or happier\r\nworld beside, and were alike unknown outside the boundaries of their\r\nown domain until some wanderer chanced to come across their\r\nsettlement, and went on his way, thereafter to remember with\r\ngratitude and envy the affluence and comfort that marked their rough\r\nbut happy homes.\"\r\n\r\nIf Tietsort was the first white settler of the Minisink, Arent\r\nSchuyler was probably the second, as he settled there in 1697, having\r\nbeen granted a patent of 1,000 acres of its lands by Governor\r\nFletcher. The governor had sent him there three years before to\r\nascertain whether the French in Canada had been trying to bribe the\r\nIndians to engage in a war of extermination against the New Yorkers\r\nfrom their fastnesses in the Shawangunk Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe earliest land transfers and titles were so thoroughly\r\ninvestigated by Ruttenber and Clark that we cannot do better,\r\nperhaps, than condense mostly from their history.\r\n\r\nWarranawonkong chiefs transferred to Governor Stuyvesant the Groot\r\nPlat or Great Plot, as it was called, in which Kingston is now\r\nsituated. These lands are said to be the first for which Europeans\r\nreceived a title from the Indians, and are somewhat indefinitely\r\ndescribed in the treaty with them of 1665 to which reference has been\r\nmade. They were conquered by Captain Kreiger in 1663, and embraced\r\nthree townships in southwestern Ulster. Chronology next takes us to\r\nthe extreme south of Orange County. Here Balthazar De Hart and his\r\nbrother Jacob, purchased of the Indians \"the Christian patent lands\r\nof Haverstraw.\" They were on the south side of the Highlands and\r\nextended from the Hudson westward to the mountains. On the\r\npresumption that they were included in the boundaries of New Jersey,\r\nthe Harts soon transferred them to Nicholas Depues and Peter Jacobs\r\nMarius, and purchased another tract north of them in 1671, which was\r\nbounded by the Hudson River on the east and the mountains on\r\nthe south. This became the property of Jacobs. They also purchased a\r\ntract north of the previous purchase, and including a part of it,\r\nwhich was called Abequerenoy, and passed from them to Hendrick Ryker.\r\n\r\nOn the north a Huguenot, Louis Du Bois, with some friends who had\r\nbeen driven from France by religious persecution, located first at\r\nEsopus in 1660; and in September, 1667, after purchase from the\r\nIndians, twelve of them became patentees of a tract of 36,000 acres\r\nlying north of the Redonte Creek, as the Warranawonkong was then\r\ncalled. The patent was obtained from Governor Andros in the names of\r\nLouis Du Bois, Christian Doyan, Abraham Hasbroucq, Andre Le Febvre,\r\nJean Hasbroucq, Pierre Doyan, Louis Beviere, Anthony Crespel, Abraham\r\nDu Bois, Hayne Frere, Isaac Du Bois and Simon Le Febvre, \"their heirs\r\nand others.\" Nine families immediately settled on the land and\r\nfounded New Paltz.\r\n\r\nBetween Haverstraw and New Paltz Patrick Mac Gregorie, David\r\nFosbruck, his brother-in-law, and twenty-five others, who were mostly\r\nScotch Presbyterians, occupied lands at the mouth of the Waoraneck,\r\nand Mac Gregorie purchased for them 4,000 acres on both sides of\r\nMurderer's Creek, on which they settled. Mac Gregorie built his cabin\r\non Plum Point, then called Conwanham's Hill, and the cabins of his\r\nassociates were in the vicinity, and on the south side of the creek\r\nDavid Toshuck, the brother-in-law, who subscribed himself \"Laird of\r\nMinivard,\" established a trading post. \"Within the bounds of the\r\npresent county of Orange this was the first European settlement,\"\r\nsays the historian, but the precise date is not given. Stickney\r\nthinks the year was 1684, but it was probably a little earlier, as\r\nabout that time Mac Gregorie entered into the military service of the\r\nState without perfecting his patent, mistakenly trusting Governor\r\nDongan to protect his interests, who, in 1684, obtained from three\r\nIndian owners their title to a tract extending from New Paltz along\r\nthe Hudson to Murderer's Kill, thence westward to the foot of the\r\nhigh hills, and thence southwesterly along the hills and the river\r\nPeakadasank to a pond; and the same year added by deed from several\r\nIndians another large tract of the land called Haverstraw. These\r\nlands included a part of those which the Indians had previously sold\r\nto Mac Gregorie, and others which they had sold to Stephanus Van\r\nCortlandt. The latter had preserved his deed, and succeeded in\r\nobtaining a patent attaching them to his manor across the river.\r\nMac Gregorie was killed in the Leslie revolution of 1691. Governor\r\nDongan sold his two purchases to John Evans in 1694, and the latter\r\nthen proceeded to dispossess Mac Gregorie's widow and her family of\r\ntheir home, when he granted only leases to them and the other Scotch\r\nsettlers. After some years, however, the Mac Gregorie heirs, in\r\nconsideration of their original claim, obtained a patent of the Plum\r\nPoint farm and a mountain tract.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and largest settlement was made adjoining \"the Christian\r\npatented lands of Haverstraw\" by emigrants from Holland, mostly of\r\nthe Reformed Dutch Church. They were granted a township patent in\r\nMarch, 1686, under the name of the town of Orange. There were sixteen\r\ntrustees of this grant, which began at the mouth of the Tappan Creek,\r\nextended north to Greenbush, and thence easterly and southerly back\r\nto Tappan Creek. The center of the township was Tappan, where a\r\nchurch was organized. The trustees of the grant were Claessen Cuyper,\r\nDaniel De Clercke, Peter Harnich, Gerritt Stenmetts, John De Kries,\r\nSr., John De Kries, Jr., Claes Maunde, John Stratemaker, Staaes De\r\nGroot, Aream Lammatees, Lamont Ariannius, Huybert Gerryts, Johannes\r\nGerryts, Ede Van Vorst, Cornelius Lammerts.\r\n\r\nA vast tract of land immediately west of Haverstraw was conveyed to\r\nDaniel Honan and Michael Hawdon, January 25, 1696. Adjoining this on\r\nthe south were certain tracts containing 2,000 acres which were\r\ngranted to Samuel Bayard. The Indian deed for this and other\r\npurchases was covered by Lucas Tenhoven and embraced 100,000 acres,\r\nfor which no patent was issued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V. V. Headley]\r\n\r\nBetween the Haverstraw lands and the township of Orange was the rocky\r\nbluff known as Verdrietig Hook, including Rockland Lake, which became\r\nthe subject of controversy between the John Hutchins Company and\r\nJarvis Marshal & Company, both parties having obtained deeds, but\r\nthat of the latter proved to be of prior date (Sept. 27, 1694). A\r\nfew years later, in 1708, a patent was issued to Lancaster Syrus,\r\nRobert Walters and Hendrick Ten Eyck, covering the vacant river\r\npoint described as beginning at the south bounds of Haverstraw,\r\nextending west to Welch's island, thence southerly to the lower end\r\nof the island, thence east to the creek running from the pond of\r\nVerdrietig Hook, and thence north to the place of beginning, \"except\r\nthe grant of Honan & Hawdon.\"\r\n\r\nRuttenber and Clark's history states that the indicated foregoing\r\npatents covered the entire district from the New Jersey line to New\r\nPaltz and west to the line of the Shawangunk Mountains.\r\n\r\nHere is the proper place for some statements made by David Barclay\r\nin his paper on Balmville read before the Newburgh Historical\r\nSociety in 1899. He said that Captain John Evans in 1694 obtained\r\nfrom Colonel Fletcher, then Governor of New York, a patent for a\r\ntract of land on the west shore of the Hudson, extending from Stony\r\nPoint to the south line of New Paltz, and westward to the Shawangunk\r\nMountains, including two-thirds of Orange County and parts of Ulster\r\nand Rockland Counties, and estimated to contain 650,000 acres. The\r\nonly settlement thereon at that time was that of Major Gregorie's\r\nheirs and followers at Murderer's Creek in the present towns of\r\nCornwall and New Windsor. The patent was afterward annulled by an\r\nact of the assembly, which was confirmed, and the title reverted to\r\nthe crown. Included in these lands must have been those unjustly\r\ntransferred to Evans in 1694 by Governor Dongan \"under the title of\r\nthe lordship of the manor of Fletcherdom.\" Ruttenber says that the\r\nEvans patents, with others, were for a long time a disturbing\r\nelement, and were entirely undefined except in general terms.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the 17th century there was active competition in\r\nthe extinguishment {_sic_} of the Indian titles and obtaining patents, and\r\nseveral patents were granted. Three of them, to associations, were\r\nissued at the following dates: Chesekook, December 30, 1702;\r\nWawayanda, March 5, 1703; Minisink, August 28, 1704.\r\n\r\nThe Chesekook patent was included in a purchase from five Indian\r\nproprietors to Dr. John Bridges, Henry Ten Eyck, Derick Vandenburgh,\r\nJohn Cholwell, Christopher Dean, Lancaster Syms and John Merritt.\r\nThe Wawayanda patent was a purchase from twelve Indians by the same\r\nparties, and five more, namely, Daniel Honan, Philip Rokeby,\r\nBenjamin Aske, Peter Mathews and Cornelius Christianse. The\r\nMinisink patent was to Mathew Ling, Ebenezer Wilson, Philip French,\r\nDerick Vandenburgh, Stephen De Lancey, Philip Rokeby, John Corbett,\r\nDaniel Honan, Caleb Cooper, William Sharpass, Robert Milward, Thomas\r\nWearham, Lancaster Syms, John Pearson, Benjamin Aske, Petrus Bayard,\r\nJohn Cholwell, Peter Fanconier, Henry Swift, Hendrick Ten Eyck,\r\nJarvis Marshall, Ann Bridges, George Clark.\r\n\r\nThis last purchase was of parts of Orange and Ulster Counties,\r\nbeginning in Ulster at Hunting House, on the northeast of Basha's\r\nland, running thence north to the Fishkill River, thence southerly\r\nto the south end of Great Minisink Island, thence south to the land\r\ngranted John Bridges & Company (Wawayanda), and along that patent\r\nnorthward and along the patent of John Evans to the place of\r\nbeginning. There is no record that the purchasers received a deed\r\nfrom the Indians, and it was reported, probably correctly, that when\r\nDepuis obtained the Minisink lands from the Indians, he got them\r\ndrunk and never paid them the money agreed upon--treatment which\r\nthey resented for a long time afterward in hostility to the white\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nThe Chesekook patent was bounded north by the patent line of Evans,\r\nwest by Highland Hills, south by Honan and Hawdon's patent, and east\r\nby \"the lands of the bounds of Haverstraw and the Hudson.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wawayanda patent was bounded eastward by \"the high hills of the\r\nHighlands\" and the Evans patent, north by the division line of the\r\ncounties of Orange and Ulster, westward by \"the high hills eastward\r\nof Minisink\" and south by the division line of New York and New\r\nJersey.\r\n\r\nThe boundary lines of the three patents were defined in such general\r\nterms that for a long time they caused trouble as to titles, and in\r\nthe final adjustment the territory claimed by the Wawayanda\r\npatentees was cut off, while on the west a tract called the Minisink\r\nangle, embracing 130,000 acres, was formed.\r\n\r\nThe English government began investigating the patents of such\r\nimmense tracts in 1698, and the next year caused the Evans patent\r\nto be annulled, after which the territory covered by it was conveyed\r\nin small tracts issued at different times up to 1775.

The\r\nWawayanda patent caused much trouble, and was unoccupied by settlers\r\nuntil 1712, when the surviving shareholders--Christopher Denne,\r\nDaniel Cromeline and Benjamin Aske--determined to make settlements\r\nthereon, and to facilitate their ends were made justices of the\r\npeace. Parties were sent out by each of them, and these began the\r\nsettlements of Goshen, Warwick and Chester, where houses were soon\r\ncompleted and occupied. The agent who preceded Denne into the\r\nwilderness was his adopted daughter, Sarah Wells, then only 16 years\r\nold, who was accompanied only by friendly Indian guides. She married\r\nWilliam Bull, the builder of Cromeline's house, and lived to the\r\ngreat age of 102 years and 15 days.\r\n\r\nSoon after the settlement thus started in 1712 John Everett and\r\nSamuel Clowes, of Jamaica, L. I., took charge of the patent, and\r\nproved to be enterprising and efficient agents. Recorded sales to\r\nsettlers and others prior to 1721, as well as to Everett and Clowes,\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Philip Rokeby sold his undivided twelfth part to Daniel\r\nCromeline, John Merritt, and Elias Boudinot, June 10th, 1704.\r\nMerritt sold his third to Cromeline in 1705. Boudinot sold his third\r\nto George McNish, who sold to Clowes, Feb. 5th, 1714, for 150 pounds.\r\n\r\n2. Cornelius Christianse sold to Derrick Vandenburgh, Sept. 8th,\r\n1704, all his twelfth part. Vandenburgh sold to Elias Boudinot, and\r\nthe latter sold one-sixth of same to Everett and Clowes, July 20th,\r\n1714, for 66L 13S. Boudinot's heirs subsequently sold five-sixths to\r\nEverett and Clowes for 41L 13S 4D. This tract embraced New Milford,\r\nin the present town of Warwick.\r\n\r\n3. Hendrick Ten Eyck sold his twelfth part to Daniel Cromeline, Dec.\r\n8th, 1704. Cromeline, who also owned two-thirds of the Rokeby share,\r\nsold to Everett and Clowes, Jan. 1st, 1714, the sixth part of his\r\ninterest for 83L 6S, excepting two tracts, one of which contained\r\nthree thousand seven hundred and six acres. This tract was\r\nprincipally in the present town of Chester, and embraced the site\r\non which he had made settlement and erected a stone dwelling, and to\r\nwhich he had given the name of \"Gray Court.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Governor George Clinton's Birthplace, New Windsor]\r\n\r\n4. Ann Bridges sold to John Van Horne, merchant, of New York, July\r\n4th, 1705, all the equal undivided twelfth part held by her husband,\r\nDr. John Bridges for the sum of 250 pounds. Van Horne was also the\r\npurchaser of a part or the whole of another share and sold to Everett\r\nand Clowes one-sixth part of one-sixth of one-thirteenth part for\r\n58L 6S 8D. Amity was in Bridges's parcel.\r\n\r\n5. Daniel Honan sold to John Merritt, 1705, all his twelfth part.\r\nMargery Merritt widow, and John Merritt, son, sold to Adrian\r\nHoaglandt one-half and to Anthony Rutgers one-half. Rutgers sold to\r\nEverett and Clowes one-twelfth of his half, and Anna, widow of\r\nHoaglandt, sold to the same parties one-twelfth, the latter, April\r\n12, 1714, for 75 pounds.\r\n\r\n6. Derrick Vandenburgh died holding his original share, and his wife,\r\nRymerich and his son Henry, his heirs, sold the same to Elias\r\nBoudinot, Aug. 8, 1707. Boudinot sold his entire share to Clowes,\r\nOct. 27th, 1713, for 355 pounds. This parcel embraced what is called\r\nin the old deeds the \"Florida tract;\" the name \"Florida\" is still\r\nretained.\r\n\r\n7. John Cholwell sold his twelfth part to Adrian Hoaglandt, Oct. 5th,\r\n1706 for 350 pounds. Anna Hoaglandt, his widow, sold to Everett and\r\nClowes one-sixth of the share, and the remainder descended to\r\nChristopher Banker and Elizabeth his wife, James Renant and Bertilje,\r\nhis wife, Petrus Rutgers and Helena his wife, her heirs.\r\n\r\n8. John Merritt held his share at the time of his death, and his\r\nheirs, Margery Meritt, widow, and John Merritt, eldest son, sold\r\none-half to Adrian Hoaglandt. John (then a resident of New London)\r\nsold to John Everett, Feb. 25th, 1714, the remaining half for 120\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n9. Benjamin Aske sold to Everett and Clowes, July 20th, 1714,\r\none-sixth of his thirteenth part for 50 pounds. He subsequently sold\r\na portion to Lawrence Decker, Feb 28th, 1719, another to Thomas\r\nBlain, May 20th, 1721; and another to Thomas DeKay, Dec. 8th 1724.\r\nIn all cases the land conveyed is described as part of his farm,\r\ncalled Warwick and in all cases the parties to whom the deeds were\r\nmade were described as residents of the county and upon the land\r\nconveyed.\r\n\r\n10. Lancaster Symes sold to Everett and Clowes, July 20th, 1714,\r\none-sixth of his thirteenth part for 50 pounds.\r\n\r\n11. Peter Matthews, then living in Albany, sold all his thirteenth\r\npart to Clowes Feb. 11th, 1713, for 200 pounds.\r\n\r\n12. Christopher Denne sold, July 20th, 1714, to Clowes and Everett\r\none-sixth of his share for 50 pounds. He also sold to Robert Brown\r\nthree hundred and ten acres Sept. 3rd, 1721. Elizabeth Denne sold to\r\nWilliam Mapes, Joseph Allison, John Yelverton, Ebenezer Holley,\r\nJoseph Sears, John Green, and John Worley, the Mapes deed bearing\r\ndate March 1st, 1729. The remainder of her interest in the patent\r\npassed by her will to Sarah Jones, spinster, of New York, and\r\nVincent Matthews. Sarah Jones afterwards married Thomas Brown.\r\n\r\n13. Dr. Samuel Staat's thirteenth part descended to his children,\r\nGerturv wife of Andries Codymus; Sarah, wife of Isaac Gouverneur;\r\nCatalyria wife of Stevanus Van Cortlandt; Anna, wife of Philip\r\nSchuyler; Johanna White, widow; and Tryntie Staats, who sold to\r\nClowes and Everett one-sixth of said part for 50 pounds, Sept. 2,\r\n1720.\r\n\r\nBy these conveyances Everett and Clowes came into possession of lands\r\nequaling four of the thirteen parts, and, as required by the terms of\r\ntheir deeds, laid out the township of Goshen in 1714, dividing it\r\ninto farms and opening roads, and assigned 200 acres of land for the\r\nsupport of a minister.\r\n\r\nSome of the first settlers--those of 1714--were: Michael Dunning\r\nJohannes Wesner, Solomon Carpenter, Abraham Finch, Samuel Seeley and\r\nJohn Holley.\r\n\r\nThe most prolonged and bitter contest of titles was between settlers\r\nof Orange County, mostly in the original Minisink region, and\r\nsettlers of Northern New Jersey. This was continued for sixty-seven\r\nyears with occasional border frays. The dispute had reference to the\r\nboundary line between New York and New Jersey. King Charles II of\r\nEngland in March, 1663, gave to his brother, the Duke of York,\r\na patent of all lands \"from the west side of the Connecticut River\r\nto the east side of Delaware Bay.\" The following year in June the\r\nDuke of York granted release of all the territory now known as New\r\nJersey to Lord Berkley and Sir George Carteret. The northern line as\r\ndescribed in this grant extended from \"the northward most branch\" of\r\nthe Delaware River, \"which is in latitude 41 degrees 40 minutes and\r\ncrosseth over thence in a straight line to the latitude 41 degrees\r\non Hudson's River.\" Sir Carteret took the east half of the province\r\nand Lord Berkley the west half. In 1673 the Dutch reconquered New\r\nYork from the English, but on February 9, 1674, in a treaty of peace\r\nbetween the two nations, it was restored to England. Sir Carteret\r\nimmediately took the precaution to have a new patent made out, which\r\ndefined the boundaries in about the same general terms as before.\r\nThen came controversies as to which should be called \"the\r\nnorthward most branch\" of the Delaware. The point of 41 degrees on\r\nthe Hudson was agreed to, but the New Yorkers insisted that the line\r\nshould touch the Delaware at the southern extremity of Big Minisink\r\nisland, and the Jerseymen {_sic_} that the point should be a little\r\nsouth of the present Cochecton. This difference made the disputed\r\ntriangular territory several miles wide at the west end. Under the\r\nNew Jersey government the land was parceled out in tracts to various\r\npersons, and when these came to take possession the men who had\r\nsettled upon them long before, resolutely maintained their claims. In\r\nthe border war that resulted numbers of the Minisink people were\r\ncaptured and confined in New Jersey prisons. The first series of\r\nengagements resulted from efforts to obtain possession of the lands\r\nof a Mr. Swartwout, who was a major in the militia of Orange County.\r\nOne day the Jerseymen {_sic_} surprised him and put his family and\r\nhousehold goods out doors. He went to Goshen for help, and a\r\nformidable company returning back with him, they in turn put the New\r\nJersey occupants and their goods out of the house, and restored it to\r\nthe major.\r\n\r\nThen a spy was employed to watch the Jerseymen, and through the\r\ninformation which he continually furnished, their future operations\r\nwere generally frustrated. About 1740 the \"Jersey lines\" made\r\nanother attempt upon the major and his possessions, but they were\r\nanticipated and driven or frightened back, no one, however, being\r\nkilled. In 1753 a Jersey raid was made to get possession of the\r\nlands of Thomas De Key, colonel of the Orange County militia and a\r\njustice of the peace. He tried to negotiate with them, and induce\r\nthem to wait until the boundary question was determined, but they\r\nrefused, and he then barricaded himself in his house, and threatened\r\nto shoot the first man who tried to enter, and they finally retired\r\nvowing that they would bring a larger force. The last important raid\r\nwas in 1765, on a Sunday, when the Jerseymen came in considerable\r\nforce resolved to capture Major and Captain Westbrook. They\r\nsurrounded the church where the Westbrooks were worshiping, and when\r\nthe service was over there was a fight, amid the screams and sobs of\r\nwomen, with fists and feet, in which the Jerseymen, being the more\r\nnumerous, conquered and captured the Westbrooks. They were confined\r\nin the Jersey colony prison awhile, and then released.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 hostilities were suspended, and commissioners were appointed\r\nto run a boundary line, and soon afterward the territory was\r\nsurveyed, and about equally divided between the claimants, and peace\r\nthenceforth was established between the two sections.\r\n\r\nIn 1683, when the county was organized, it did not contain more than\r\ntwenty families. In 1698 a first census was ordered by Governor\r\nBellmont, and it showed the population to consist of 20 men, 31\r\nwomen, 140 children and 19 Negro slaves. In 1860 the population had\r\nincreased to 63,812; in 1880, it was 88,220; in 1900, 103,850; and\r\naccording to the last census of 1905, our population was 108,267.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IV.\r\n TOPOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrange County is unsurpassed by any other in the Empire State in\r\nvariety of surface features and picturesque beauty of scenery. It has\r\nmountain ranges and extended ridges, streams with wide and narrow\r\nvalleys, and is dotted with lakes and ponds. Along the mountain lines\r\nare a few lofty peaks, and there are many isolated hills and rocky\r\nprecipices. Parts of its boundaries are the Hudson River on the\r\nnortheast, the Delaware and Mongaup Rivers on the west, and the\r\nShawangunk Kill on the northwest. Near the center the Wallkill winds\r\nalong its rich valley into Ulster County, and thence into the Hudson.\r\nIts principal tributary on the northwest is Rutgers Creek--which also\r\nhas several tributaries--and others are Monhagen Creek, Mechanicstown\r\nCreek and Shawangunk Kill. On the southwest it gathers in the waters\r\nof Warwick Creek--which is swollen by smaller streams in its\r\ncourse--and also Quaker, Rio Grande, and Tin Brook Creeks. The Otter\r\nKill flows easterly from Chester into the Hudson. The Neversink flows\r\nfrom Sullivan County through the town of Deer Park, and becomes a\r\ntributary of the Hudson. The course of the Ramapo is southerly from\r\nRound Pond in Monroe to Rockland County, and it is fed by several\r\nother ponds. Other streams, large and small, are numerous.\r\n\r\nThe central portion of the county consists of rolling uplands broken\r\nby deep valleys. The most prominent of the mountain ranges are the\r\nHighlands along its eastern border. Their loftiest peak, Butter Hill,\r\nis 1,524 feet high, precipitous on the river side, and sloping on the\r\nnorth. Another name given to it is Storm King, because clouds\r\noccasionally gather there from different directions and concentrate\r\nin storms of rain and lightning. Cro'-nest {_sic_} adjoins it on the\r\nsouth, and is 1,418 feet above the Hudson. Bare Mountain is next,\r\nwith a height of 1,350 feet. Mount Independence, with Fort Putnam on\r\nits summit, is the background of the West Point plateau. Other well\r\nknown hills are in this broken range, where Arnold, the traitor,\r\nconferred with Andre, the spy, and is more intimately identified with\r\nthe military history of the country than any other mountain region.\r\nIt has been written of Butter Hill and Cro'-nest that \"they have a\r\ncharm which might induce a man to live in their shadow for no other\r\npurpose than to have them always before him, day and night, to study\r\ntheir ever-changing beauty.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gate of the Highlands]\r\n\r\nThe Shawangunk Mountains are a spur of the Alleghenies stretching\r\nnortheast across the western angle of the county. They are less\r\nbroken than the Highlands, and not so high as the Catskills, but of\r\nthe same general formation. The western side is precipitous, but the\r\neastern is sloping, and some of its lands are very fertile, producing\r\nsweet grasses from which much of the famous Orange County butter has\r\nbeen made. The peaks rise from 1,400 to 1,800 feet above tide water.\r\nThis range was the original dividing line between the Wawayanda and\r\nChesekook patents.\r\n\r\nThe Schunnemunk range is on the dividing line of the towns of Monroe\r\nand Blooming Grove and a part of that of Blooming Grove and Cornwall.\r\nAn accepted descriptive phrase for the range is, \"the high hills west\r\nof the Highlands.\" North of it, in New Windsor and Newburgh, is\r\nMuchattoes hill, west of it Woodcock hill, and southwest of the\r\nlatter are Round, Mosquito, Rainer's and Peddler's hills; also Torn\r\nRocks, which rise in two rocky peaks 200 feet high. To the southwest,\r\nin the town of Warwick, are the Bellvale Mountains, and south of\r\nthese the Sterling Mountains. Several other mountainous elevations\r\nin Warwick and Woodbury punctuate this part of the county and also\r\nthe border country on the west. The feet of Pochuck Mountain are in\r\nthe Drowned Lands, and northerly in Warwick are Mounts Adam and Eve,\r\nwith Adam looking down from his superior height upon the longer Eve.\r\nEasterly, in Chester, is Sugar Loaf Mountain, and west of this is\r\nMount Lookout, the principal elevation of Goshen. With the further\r\nmention of Mount William and Point Peter, looking down upon Port\r\nJervis, let us clip the long list of Orange County elevations.\r\n\r\nValleys connect mountains and hills. That of the Delaware River,\r\nalong the border of Deer Park, is narrow and irregular, being much\r\nbroken by tributaries and mountains. The most of the cultivated\r\nlands of Deer Park are along the Neversink valley. The valley of the\r\nWallkill is wide, fertile and beautiful its bottom lands are among\r\nthe best in the State, and its farmers are prosperous and thrifty.\r\nWide flats, gradual slopes and steep declivities give variety of soil\r\nand scenery to the Otterkill valley, and much of its scenery is\r\ncharming. The same may be said of its tributary, Cromeline Creek.\r\nSugar Loaf valley extends from Sugar Loaf Mountain to the village of\r\nWarwick, taking in Wickham Pond in its course, and extending into\r\nNew Jersey. Smith's Clove, extending from Highland Mills to the\r\nRamapo valley, should be mentioned because it was the birthplace of\r\nChief Justice William Smith, his brother, John Hett Smith, and the\r\nnotorious Tories, Claudius Smith and his two sons.\r\n\r\nOne cannot travel far in Orange County in most directions without\r\ncoming upon a lake or a pond, and there are dozens of them in the\r\nsoutheastern section. These feed its many streams, and when Eager\r\nwrote his history he said there was not one town in the county that\r\nhad not water power to some extent. Beginning in the northern part of\r\nthe Highlands in Cornwall the lake-and-pond system extends through\r\nthe towns of Highland and Monroe to Greenwood Lake, thence west and\r\nnorth to Big Meadow Pond in the Highlands. Greenwood Lake, in\r\nWarwick, is the largest body of water in the county. It is about nine\r\nmiles long and one wide, is partly in New Jersey, and is a feeder for\r\nthe Morris Canal. Sutherland's Pond, half a mile long, southeast from\r\nCro'-nest Mountain, has an outlet which runs into Murderer's Creek.\r\nBig Meadow Pond, in Highlands, covers about 300 acres, and its outlet\r\npours over the rocks of Buttermilk Falls. The waters of Round Pond\r\nflow into Long Pond under a natural bridge about 80 feet wide, but\r\nthe stream is lost sight of until it emerges on the other side. This\r\nis similar to the outlet of Washington Lake in New Windsor, which\r\nemerges at Trout-hole and there becomes a fall of forty feet.\r\nSterling Lake, at the beginning of the Warwick series, covers about\r\nsixty acres, and in 1751 iron works were established at its outlet.\r\nRound Pond, in Wawayanda, is in shape what its name implies, has no\r\nvisible outlet, its water is clear, pure and deep, and it is about a\r\nmile in circumference. Thompson's Pond, in the northwestern part of\r\nWarwick, covers about 100 acres, feeds Quaker's Creek, and this\r\noutlet furnishes power for mills. Orange Lake, in Newburgh, covers\r\nabout 100 acres. But all the lakes and ponds of Orange are too many\r\nto be named. They are almost as interesting a feature of the county\r\nas its streams.\r\n\r\nOrange County is richer in alluviums than any other in the State,\r\nas they cover about 40,000 acres. The \"Drowned Lands,\" as they were\r\nformerly called, include about forty square miles, and are partly in\r\nNew Jersey, but mostly in New York, extending in Orange from Cheeunk\r\nOutlet in Goshen through Wawayanda and Minisink to the New Jersey\r\nline, and covering about 17,000 acres. They contain a number of\r\nfertile islands, and thousands of acres of the waste lands have been\r\nrecovered by means of an artificial outlet, which, at first a mere\r\nditch, has been deepened and widened by the flowing water until the\r\nprincipal flow is through it. These recovered lands are rich and\r\nproductive. They are belted by the Wallkill and three creeks, and the\r\nWallkill's course through them is long because so crooked. The Gray\r\nCourt meadows extend from near Craigville in Blooming Grove into the\r\nnorthern part of Chester, and embrace about 500 acres, which are\r\nnearly all under cultivation and very productive. They are drained by\r\nCromeline Creek. The Black Meadows, in Chester and Warwick, are about\r\n1,000 acres in extent, and Black Meadow Creek flows through them.\r\nLong Swamp, in Warwick, also contains about 1,000 acres, and is\r\ndrained into New Jersey. Great Pine Swamp extends northward from\r\nHowells on the Erie railroad seven miles in the town of Wallkill, and\r\nembraces many oases and cultivated farms. There are several other\r\nscattered areas of swamp lands. In the marl and peat beds in several\r\nlocalities many bones of the extinct mastodon have been found,\r\nincluding two complete skeletons. One of the latter was taken from a\r\nbed near Coldenham in 1845, and weighed 1,995 pounds, and the other\r\nfrom a bed in the town of Mt. Hope, and weighed 1,700 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the county has been changed somewhat by its\r\nrailroads, of which there are 250 miles, not including double\r\ntrackage or trolley roads. The following places in towns extending\r\nacross the county have each direct railroad communication north,\r\neast, south and west: Port Jervis, Middletown, Campbell Hall, Goshen,\r\nChester and Newburgh. The wagon roads are numerous, generally good,\r\nand are charming arteries for carriages and automobiles.\r\n\r\nThe geology of Orange County is as varied as its topography. Along\r\nthe eastern feet of the Shawangunk Mountains are Heidelberg\r\nlimestones, gray and Medina sandstones, shales and grits, and the\r\nmountain rocks are mostly sandstones, shales and grits. The grits\r\nextend along the top of the range through the county and are from 60\r\nto 150 feet thick. Heidelberg limestone extends from the Mamakating\r\nvalley to the Delaware River. Grit and red rocks are on the west side\r\nof Greenwood Lake, and grit of various colors extends from Round Hill\r\nto Woodcock Mountain, and is also found in the southwest base of the\r\nSchunnemunk range and in Pine Hill. Grawacke is the rock on the\r\nsoutheast side of the Bellvale range in Warwick, and is found in the\r\ntown of Blooming Grove in the Schunnemunk range. The Hudson River\r\ngroup occupies a large part of the surface of the county, and\r\nconsists of slates, shales, grits, limestones, breccias and\r\nconglomerates. It extends from the Hudson River through Warwick to\r\nthe Jersey line, and from the Hudson at Cornwall Landing to four\r\nmiles above Newburgh. It is stratified with grawacke and grawacke\r\nslate. It forms the surface rock of the most of Goshen and Blooming\r\nGrove, and parts of Cornwall, New Windsor, Newburgh, Montgomery,\r\nHamptonburgh, Crawford, Wallkill, Mt. Hope and Minisink. Dark Utica\r\nslate is found on the banks of the Hudson near Newburgh. Trenton\r\nlimestone appears in Hamptonburgh near Mount Lookout, and this\r\nmountain is composed of Black River limestone, which is also found on\r\nBig Island in the Drowned Lands and in Minisink. There is a bed of\r\nblue limestone about a mile wide extending from the Hudson at\r\nHampton southeasterly through Newburgh into New Windsor. It is also\r\nfound in the towns of Cornwall, Blooming Grove, Warwick, Monroe and\r\nGoshen. Oolitic limestone is on Big Island, near New Milford, and on\r\nPochunck Neck.\r\n\r\nSlate rocks of the Taconic system are above Newburgh, and its\r\nlimestone between the Highlands and Grove Pond Mountain. Its white\r\nlimestone appears in Warwick, where it is in narrow ridges separated\r\nby other rocks. It is also found along the shore of the Drowned Lands\r\nat Amity, and near Fort Montgomery in the Highlands, from which it\r\nmay be traced by way of Little Pond across the Ramapo. In some\r\nlocalities it is so white as to be translucent. Many different\r\nminerals are found in it.\r\n\r\nThe primary rocks of the county consist of gneiss, hornblende,\r\ngranite, sienite, limestone, serpentine, angite and trappeau. They\r\nextend over parts of several towns, and several mountains and hills\r\nare composed of them. Granite is found at the foot of Butter Hill,\r\nsienite at Butter Hill and on the east side of Bare Mountain at West\r\nPoint, gneiss along the Highlands, mica and slate north of Fort\r\nMontgomery, angite rock between West Point and Round Pond and at\r\nseveral points in Monroe, greenstone trap at Tuxedo Pond, granular\r\nlimestone at Cro'-nest and Butter Hill. Quartz rock and hornblende\r\nare all along the Highlands and in Monroe and Warwick. Crystalline\r\nserpentine is in the white limestone in Warwick, serpolite at Amity,\r\nyellow garnet at Edenville, soapstone in Monroe. Large sheets of\r\nmica are found southwest of the Forshee iron mine in Monroe, and in\r\nthis mine, which embraces an entire hill, are red garnet, brown\r\ntremoline, carbonate of copper, serpentine, cocolite and umber. In\r\nthe O'Neil mine, half a mile northeast of the Forshee mine, are\r\ncrystallized magnetic ore, magnetic and copper pyrites, carbonate of\r\ncopper, serpentine, amianthus, asbestos, brown and rhombic spars,\r\nangite, cocolite, feldspar and mica.\r\n\r\nThere are beds of arsenical and titanium ores in Warwick and a bed of\r\nhemolite ore near Canterbury village. Magnetic oxide of iron abounds\r\nin the primitive rocks of the Highlands, and at West Point is\r\nassociated with hornblende. Beds of lead have been opened at\r\nEdenville and in the towns of Mt. Hope and Deer Park, and zinc and\r\ncopper ores have been found in small quantities. The Sterling iron\r\nbed in Monroe, which was opened in 1781, extends over about thirty\r\nacres, and has produced so strong an ore that it has been much used\r\nin the manufacture of cannon. There are a number of other iron mines.\r\nSearches for the traditional silver, gold, lead and tin mines have\r\nbeen without satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nMany evidences of glacial action in Orange County include masses of\r\nboulders scattered in places throughout the county. These are mostly\r\nof granite and gneiss, and there is occasionally one of grawacke. The\r\neastern slope of the Shawangunk Mountains gives evidence of the\r\npassage there of an enormous glacier, which ground the rocks into the\r\nrich soil that has been cultivated there for 200 years. Some of the\r\ncounty's drift deposits are valuable for casting, brick and pottery\r\nmaking, lithographic stones and glass.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the semicircular plateau from the Highlands of the Hudson\r\nto the Dans Kamer is mostly a mixture of gravel, sand and clay, which\r\nform a warm and fertile loam. That of the wide Wallkill valley is\r\nalluvium mixed with clay, sand and gravel and is easily worked and\r\nrichly productive. So is the soil brought down from the hills in the\r\ntown of Deer Park. The lands on the islands of the Drowned Lands are\r\namong the richest in the county. The alluvium of the Otterkill is a\r\nsandy and gravelly loam. In other sections of the county there is an\r\nalternating variety of soils, rich, medium and poor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thos. W. Bradley]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER V.\r\n EARLY GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nUntil after the conquest of New York by the English in 1664 Holland\r\nmethods of government, with a local government for each town,\r\nprevailed. The next year the English introduced courts and sheriffs.\r\nIn 1682 Thomas Dongan was appointed governor, with directions to\r\norganize a council of not more than ten \"eminent inhabitants,\" and\r\nissue writs for the election by freeholders of a general assembly,\r\nthe members of which should consult with the governor and his\r\ncouncil as to what laws were necessary for the good government of\r\nthe province. The first meeting of the first general assembly was in\r\nNew York in 1683, and it passed fourteen acts, which were assented to\r\nby the governor and his council. One of them established twelve\r\ncounties, as follows: New York, Kings, Queens, Suffolk, Richmond,\r\nWestchester, Albany, Ulster, Dutchess, Orange, Duke's and Cornwall.\r\n\r\nExcept Orange, to be in the care of New York, and Ulster, to be in\r\nthe care of Dutchess, the counties were to be entitled to\r\nrepresentation in future general assemblies. Another act established\r\ntown courts to be held for the trial of minor cases each month;\r\ncounty courts and courts of sessions, to be held quarterly or\r\nhalf-yearly; a general court of oyer and terminer, with original\r\nand appellate power, to be held twice a year in each county; and a\r\ncourt of chancery, or supreme court, composed of the governor and\r\nhis council, for which the governor was empowered to deputize a\r\nchancellor to act in his place.\r\n\r\nThis was the system of administering justice eight years. Then, in\r\n1691, Courts of Justices of Peace were organized in each town, and\r\nCourts of Common Pleas for each county. In 1701 an act was passed\r\nrequiring justices of the peace in each county to meet once a year\r\nat a Court of Sessions, to examine and allow necessary charges\r\nagainst the county and its towns.\r\n\r\nThere were supervisors, assessors and collectors in each town from\r\nthe first, and in 1691 the freeholders of each town were empowered to\r\nchoose three surveyors to lay out and look after highways and fences,\r\nand also to ordain laws and rules for the improvement of village,\r\npasturage and other lands.\r\n\r\nSuch were the laws which directed the early administration of\r\ngovernment in Orange County.\r\n\r\nFor many years previous to 1701 Orange County shared in serious\r\ncorruptions and frauds which were prevalent in the province. The\r\nAssembly which convened in 1698 was so turbulent and brought so much\r\nconfusion into its councils that Governor Bellomont, who succeeded\r\nGovernor Fletcher that year, dissolved it and ordered a new election,\r\ntaking care that the untrustworthy sheriffs of his predecessor were\r\nretired from the management. Protests were made to the King, but\r\nwithout avail. The Governor had been clothed with power to correct\r\nabuses, to veto any law, and \"to adjourn, prorogue and dissolve the\r\nAssembly.\" The new Assembly, which consisted of seven Englishmen and\r\nfourteen Dutchmen, instituted some important reforms. It nullified\r\ngrants to large tracts of lands, regulated election methods, and\r\nprovided punishments for frauds. Unfortunately Governor Bellomont\r\ndied in 1701, before some of his plans could be carried into effect,\r\nand Lord Cornbury was appointed as his successor, and acquired the\r\ndistinction of being \"the worst of all the Governors under the\r\nEnglish crown.\" He was notoriously ill-mannered, dishonest,\r\nrapacious, and openly vicious. The Assembly refused grants of money\r\nwhich he asked for, and asserted the rights of the people, declaring\r\nthat they could not \"be justly divested of their property without\r\ntheir consent.\" Thus began in New York the preliminary struggle which\r\nbrought on the Revolution, ending in the establishment of the\r\nRepublic, in which the representatives of Orange earnestly assisted.\r\n\r\nThe first sessions of the Court of Common Pleas and of justices of\r\nthe peace as a Board of Supervisors were held in Orangetown in April,\r\n1703. The court justices were William Merritt and John Merritt. The\r\nsupervisors were William and John Merritt, Cornelius Cypher, Tunis\r\nVan Ronton, Thomas Burroughs and Michael Hawdon. The sheriff was John\r\nPerry, the clerk was William Haddleston, and the constable was\r\nConradt Hanson. Orange and Ulster County people were then required to\r\ndo their surrogate business in New York. This was continued until\r\n1751, when the Court of Common Pleas of the county was empowered to\r\ntake proof of wills and grant letters of administration. The Court of\r\nCommon Pleas was an institution of the county until 1847, when the\r\nCounty Court was substituted. The Supreme Court began holding\r\nsessions in Orange in 1704, and was succeeded by Circuit Courts\r\nestablished under the Constitution of 1821, as these were by the\r\njudicial system of 1846, consisting of a Supreme Court, Circuit\r\nCourt, and Court of Oyer and Terminer. Surrogate's Courts were not\r\nestablished until 1854. In 1727 the original county was divided into\r\ntwo court districts, and the sessions were held alternately in\r\nOrangetown and Goshen, the former being the shire town. Not until\r\n1798 was Goshen made the shire town, when the sessions alternated\r\nbetween Goshen and Newburgh, an arrangement which still continues.\r\n\r\nThe first public buildings for the original county were constructed\r\nat Orangetown in 1703. In 1740 a building of wood and stone for\r\ncourt house and jail was erected in Goshen, at a cost of 100 pounds,\r\nand was torn down about 1776. a new stone court-house having been\r\nerected in 1773 to take its place, at a cost of 1,400 pounds. The old\r\nOrange court-house had been replaced by a new structure in 1704, and\r\nsome years afterward was destroyed by fire. The Goshen building came\r\ninto the present county when it was reorganized under the Act of\r\n1775. It was two stories high, with a court-room on the second floor,\r\nand on the first a sheriff's office and dwelling, and a dungeon for\r\nprisoners. During the Revolution Tories and war prisoners were\r\nconfined in it, one of them being John Hett Smith, arrested for\r\ncomplicity in Arnold's treason, and who managed to escape. A third\r\nstory was added to this building about 1800, and on the new floor\r\nwere a main jail room, a dungeon with one grated window which could\r\nbe completely darkened, and three other rooms for the county clerk,\r\nsurrogate and jailer respectively. Above were a cupola and bell.\r\nCourt-houses were erected in Goshen and Newburgh in 1842, by\r\nauthority of an act of the Legislature, the Newburgh building at a\r\ncost of $17,000 and the Goshen building at a cost of $13,000. The\r\nlatter structure has been completely remodeled lately, and is now a\r\nfine, up-to-date building. The county clerk's office in Goshen--a\r\none-story brick building--was constructed in 1851. and the building\r\nthere for the surrogate and supervisors in 1874, at a cost of $7,400.\r\n\r\nThe county house for the poor, four miles south of Goshen, was built\r\nin 1830 at a cost of $11,000 for the building and $1,000 for 128\r\nacres of land. The building has since been improved and is now 50 by\r\n100 feet and 3-1/2 stories high. In 1848 a building for the insane\r\nwas added, which is 30 by 50 feet, and in 1865 a separate building\r\nfor colored people was erected. In 1875 another building for the\r\nchronic insane was erected, the cost of which was $20,000, and its\r\ndimensions 80 by 40 feet and 4-1/2 stories high. The farm has been\r\nincreased to 263 acres, 200 of which are tillable, and has been\r\nprovided with the requisite outbuildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VI.\r\n EARLY MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the section of Orange County taken from Ulster the first two\r\ncompanies of militia were organized before 1738. The regiment to\r\nwhich they were attached consisted of nine companies, located as\r\nfollows: Kingston 3, Marbletown 1, Wallkill 1, Hurley 1, Rochester 1,\r\nNew Paltz 1, Highlands 1.\r\n\r\nThe regimental officers were: Colonel, A. Gaasbeck Chambers;\r\nlieutenant-colonel, Wessel Ten Broeck; major, Coenradt F. Elmendorf;\r\nquartermaster, Cornelius Elmendorf.\r\n\r\nThe following lists give the names of the officers and privates in\r\nthe territory which is now a part of Orange County:\r\n\r\nFoot Company of the Highlands.\r\n\r\nOfficers: Captain, Thomas Ellison; ensign, John Young; sergeants,\r\nDavid Davids, Moses Gariston, P.

Kingston\r\nwas included in the northern one, and the southern was embraced in\r\nthe precincts of Highlands, Wallkill and Shawangunk. These regiments\r\ntook part in the French and Indian War.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1773, the officers of the Southern Regiment were:\r\nColonel, Thomas Ellison; lieutenant-colonel, Charles Clinton; major,\r\nCadwallader Colden, Jr.; adjutant, Johannes Jansen.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 the New York Provincial Congress passed a law for organizing\r\nmilitia which provided that counties, cities and precincts should be\r\ndivided, so that a company might be formed in each district to\r\nconsist of about 85 men, including officers, between the ages of 16\r\nand 50 years; that these should be formed into regiments of from five\r\nto ten companies each; that the regiments should be classed in six\r\nbrigades, under a brigadier-general and brigade major, and the\r\nentire force should be commanded by a major-general.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Brigade when formed consisted of five Orange County\r\nregiments, the colonels of which were William Allison of Goshen,\r\nJesse Woodhull of Cornwall, John Hathorn of Warwick, A. Hawkes Hay of\r\nOrangetown, and Abraham Lent of Haverstraw. The four Ulster County\r\nregiments were commanded by Johannes Hardenberg of Kingston, James\r\nClinton of New Windsor, Lee Pawling of Marbletown, and Jonathan\r\nHasbrouck of Newburgh.\r\n\r\nColonel Allison's regimental district consisted of Goshen and the\r\nwestern part of Orange County.

They were home\r\nguards. In case of alarm, invasion or insurrection, the companies\r\nwere instructed to march and oppose the enemy, and immediately send\r\nan express to the commander of the regiment or brigade, who was to\r\ncontrol their movements.\r\n\r\nUnder a law passed by the Continental Congress in May, 1775, three\r\ncompanies of minute men were raised in the southern district of\r\nUlster, with the following officers:\r\n\r\nNewburgh Minute Company: Uriah Drake, captain; Jacob Lawrence and\r\nWilliam Ervin, lieutenants; Thomas Dunn, ensign.\r\n\r\nNew Windsor Minute Company: Samuel Logan, captain; John Robinson,\r\nensign; David Mandeville and John Scofield, sergeants.\r\n\r\nHanover Minute Company: Peter Hill, captain; James Latta and\r\nNathaniel Hill, lieutenants; William Goodyear, ensign.\r\n\r\nThese companies and one organized in Marlborough formed a regiment\r\nwhich was officered as follows:\r\n\r\nThomas Palmer, colonel; Thomas Johnston, Jr., lieutenant-colonel;\r\nArthur Parks, first major; Samuel Logan, second major; Isaac Belknap,\r\nquartermaster.\r\n\r\nAnother regiment was formed from two companies organized in Goshen\r\nand Cornwall, with the following officers:\r\n\r\nCornwall Minute Company: Thomas Moffat, captain; Seth Marvin and\r\nJames Little, lieutenants; Nathan Strong, ensign, who was succeeded\r\nby William Bradley.\r\n\r\nGoshen Minute Company: Moses Hetfield, captain; Cole Gale and Daniel\r\nEverett, lieutenants. Later James Butler and William Barker were\r\nchosen lieutenants and William Carpenter ensign.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the regiment were:\r\n\r\nIsaac Nicoll, colonel; Gilbert Cooper, lieutenant-colonel; Henry V.\r\nVerbeyck, first major; Hezekiah Howell, Jr., second major; Ebenezer\r\nWoodhull, adjutant; Nehemiah Carpenter, quartermaster.\r\n\r\nBoth of these regiments of minute men were on duty in the Highlands\r\nin 1775-6; but the system did not work satisfactorily, and in June,\r\n1776, Congress repealed the law.\r\n\r\nThree drafts were made in 1776 to reinforce the army--in June, July\r\nand September. Under the first draft Orange County sent three\r\ncompanies and Ulster four to the vicinity of New York City, as a part\r\nof General John Morin Scott's Brigade. The second draft took\r\none-fourth of the militia under Colonels Nicoll and Pauling,\r\nconstituting a brigade under General George Clinton. By the third\r\nsixty-two men were drawn from Colonel Hasbrouck's Regiment, and were\r\na part of 600 men which reinforced the garrisons at Forts Clinton and\r\nMontgomery.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1776, companies of rangers were organized for the protection\r\nof the frontiers, and three of them were raised in Ulster County,\r\nunder Captains Isaac Belknap of Newburgh, Jacob De Witt of Deer Park,\r\nand Elias Hasbrouck of Kingston.\r\n\r\nOf the four \"Continental\" Regiments organized in 1775 to serve six\r\nmonths, the one commanded by Colonel James Clinton was largely\r\ncomposed of Orange and Ulster County men. Orange furnished two\r\ncompanies--Captain Daniel Denton's of Goshen and Captain John\r\nNicholson's of New Windsor. The four regiments were in the expedition\r\nto Canada in 1775.\r\n\r\nUnder a call by Congress of January 8, 1776, for troops to reinforce\r\nthe army in Canada, New York furnished one battalion. A second call\r\nwas made on January 19, under which New York was required to furnish\r\nfour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samuel Brandt]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VII.\r\n FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French and Indian War was the result of rivalry between France\r\nand England for the possession of disputed territories in North\r\nAmerica, and the Indians along the Delaware and other frontiers\r\nbecame allies of the French because they believed they had been\r\ncheated by the English and Dutch colonists, and were stimulated to\r\nhostility against them by French agents.\r\n\r\nIn 1754 England directed her colonies to oppose with arms the\r\nencroachments of the French, although the two nations were then at\r\npeace, and obedience to this command from the crown brought on the\r\ncruel war of 1755. In February of that year New York voted 40,000\r\npounds sterling to defray war expenses, and ordered a levy of 800 men\r\nto co-operate with troops of other colonies in the impending\r\nstruggle. The law also declared that slaves were liable to military\r\nduty, and if over 14 years of age they were forbidden to be found\r\nmore than a mile from their master's residence without his\r\ncertificate of permission, and \"if one of them were so found any\r\nwhite person might kill him without being liable to prosecution.\"\r\n\r\nAlong the Delaware River the Indians had been complaining that the\r\nwhites appropriated lands which they had not bought, and by getting\r\nthem drunk had defrauded them of the purchase money for their lands\r\nand their furs. These complaints led the Pennsylvania proprietaries\r\nto call a council, with the head chiefs of the Six Nations as\r\narbitrators, and by bribing these chiefs with presents they obtained\r\nfrom them a decision which obliged the Delawares, then wards of the\r\nSenecas, to give up their lands and move to Wyoming. Soon whites\r\nfollowed them and bought in fraudulent ways their Wyoming lands. This\r\nangered the Senecas, and they drove away their chief who had aided\r\nthe whites, and bade the Delawares defend their homes. The eastern\r\nand western chiefs met at Allegheny, rehearsed their grievances, and\r\nresolved on vengeance. The bloody scenes that followed have seldom\r\nbeen surpassed in barbarous cruelty and cunning, and the ravages of\r\nthe Minsis were mostly confined to the western frontiers of Orange\r\nand Ulster Counties within the limits of the original Minisink\r\npatent.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of the Minisink observed that the Indians there,\r\nincluding squads who had been friendly, had suddenly disappeared, and\r\nthe few that remained said they had gone west to join hostile tribes.\r\nForeseeing trouble, some of the settlers sent their wives and\r\nchildren to places of comparative safety, and a well-settled region\r\non the west side of the Wallkill, eight by fifteen miles in extent,\r\nwas abandoned, some of the residents moving to the east side and\r\nothers far away. Before they moved seven men and one woman had been\r\nkilled by the Indians. In 1756, pending negotiations for peace, four\r\nmen and two women were killed in the Minisink. Three of the men went\r\ninto the harvest field with their guns and laid them down, when\r\nconcealed Indians seized them, shot the men dead and scalped them.\r\nAt Fort Westfall, which the Indians tried to capture by surprise,\r\nthere was a fight in which several Indians and seven soldiers were\r\nkilled. A large party of Indians attacked the upper fort at\r\nNeversink, which was well garrisoned, but the fort took fire from a\r\nburning barn near it, and its inmates had to leave. Only one of them\r\nescaped the Indian bullets and tomahawks, and among the killed was\r\nthe wife of the captain, who was absent. Only a colored woman, hidden\r\nfrom view by the smoke, escaped. The captain returned a day or two\r\nafterwards, and took an oath of vengeance by the grave of his wife.\r\nA man named Owen was killed by strolling Indians in Asa Dolsen's\r\nmeadow in the northwestern part of present Wawayanda, and Dolsen\r\nimmediately moved to Goshen. David Cooley lived near him, and his\r\nwife was shot dead as she was walking from her house to an outdoor\r\noven. In 1758, on the New Jersey frontier, one day, when Nicholas\r\nCole was absent from home, thirteen Indians rushed in, tomahawked\r\nand scalped his two daughters and a son-in-law, and carried off his\r\nwife and a young son. When Cole returned the Indians were followed\r\nand frightened, and allowed the wife and boy to escape. In June of\r\nthe same year a sergeant and several men went from Wawarsing\r\nblock-house to Minisink, and not returning, a large party went in\r\nsearch of them and found seven killed and scalped, and three wounded,\r\nand that a woman and four children had been carried off. About this\r\ntime a house containing seventeen persons was beset by Indians and\r\nall of them were killed. They carried off a little son of Mr.\r\nWestfall in Minisink, and he never saw his father again, but when\r\nthe latter died, he came back with an interpreter after his\r\ninheritance. The persuasions and pecuniary offers of his mother\r\ncould not induce him to abandon his life in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1758 that Governor Hardy caused a series of block-houses\r\nto be erected along the western frontier, which were a protection\r\nfor the whites and a restraint to the Indians. In the latter part of\r\nthat year negotiations with the head chief of the Delawares,\r\nTeedyusking, stopped hostilities for a time. The Minsis were paid for\r\ntheir lands in the Minisink, and the titles of the proprietaries\r\nwere referred to the Government for adjustment. But subsequently\r\n\"the Indian allies of the French\" held the frontier in terror until\r\nafter the fall of Montreal and Quebec, when all of French Canada was\r\ntransferred to British authority.\r\n\r\nIn an address before the Newburgh Historical Society in 1885, E. M.\r\nRuttenber said:\r\n\r\n\"In common with its associate regiments in Orange and Ulster,\r\nColonel Ellison's Regiment had no little service in the French and\r\nIndian War of 1756, on the western frontier of the county, where the\r\nMinsis were scattering firebrands and death in their rebellion\r\nagainst the domination of the Six Nations, and for the recovery of\r\nthe lands in the Minisink patent, of which they had been defrauded,\r\nand in 1757 marched to Fort Edward to aid Sir William Johnston. How\r\ngreat was the service performed or by whom personally we may never\r\nknow. The depredations of the Minsis were terrible; the settlements\r\nwest of the Wallkill were perpetually harassed, and many of them\r\nbroken up; men were killed in the fields and in their houses; women\r\nand children became the victims of the scalping knife.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Ellison wrote in 1757:\r\n\r\n\"It is but too well known by the late numerous murders committed on\r\nour borders that the County of Ulster and the north end of Orange\r\nhave become the only frontier part of the province left unguarded and\r\nexposed to the cruel incursions of the Indian enemy, and the\r\ninhabitants of these parts have been obliged to perform very hard\r\nmilitary duty for these two years past, in ranging the woods and\r\nguarding the frontiers, these two counties keeping out almost\r\nconstantly from fifty to one hundred men--sometimes by false\r\ndetachments of the militia, and at other times by voluntary\r\nsubscriptions--nay, often two hundred men, which has been an\r\ninsupportable burden on the people, and yet all the militia of\r\nthese parts are ordered to march to Fort Edward, while the officers\r\nhad no orders to guard the frontier.\"\r\n\r\nMention may be made here of a famous character of the Minisink.\r\nwhose unequaled career of revenge against Indians began during the\r\nFrench and Indian War. His name was Thomas Quick. His father was\r\nkind and hospitable to the Indians, and was shot dead while at work\r\nin his field by some of them whom he had entertained. Thomas, who was\r\nnear him, and was then almost a youth, managed to escape. Over his\r\nfather's grave he took an oath to avenge his death, and afterward to\r\nkill Indians became the passion of his life. It was said that he shot\r\neighty-seven of them, the last one being the chief murderer of his\r\nfather. He went by the name of \"the Indian slayer.\" He was\r\nmarvelously alert and cunning, escaped all of the many efforts of\r\nIndians to kill him, and finally died of old age. A monument has been\r\nerected to his memory in Milford, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER VIII.\r\n WAR OF THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting period of our national history was its\r\nbeginnings in protests against oppressive demands and acts by the\r\nmother country, followed by a revolutionary resort to arms, and in\r\nthese beginnings Orange County took a conspicuous part.\r\n\r\nThe non-importation resolutions adopted by the Continental Congress\r\nin 1774 drew the line of issue between Great Britain and her North\r\nAmerican colonies, which started the war for independence. Perhaps\r\ntheir most significant feature was a call for the organization of\r\ncommittees of safety in every city, county, precinct and town. In the\r\noriginal County of Orange the people had held a convention in Goshen,\r\nwhich sent a delegate, Henry Wisner, to Congress, who voted for and\r\nsigned the non-importation resolutions; and in the towns of Newburgh,\r\nNew Windsor, Hanover, Wallkill and Goshen an opposition pamphlet\r\nwhich had been scattered broadcast was publicly burned and the\r\ndesired committees of safety promptly selected. On April 29, 1774,\r\nthe committee in New York drew up a pledge and sent it to all the\r\ncounties and towns for signatures. The pledge was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Persuaded that the salvation of the rights and liberties of America\r\ndepend, under God, on the firm union of its inhabitants in a\r\nvigorous prosecution of the measures necessary for its safety; and\r\nconvinced of the necessity of preventing anarchy and confusion which\r\nattend the dissolution of the powers of government, we, the freemen,\r\nfreeholders and inhabitants of ____ do, in the most solemn manner,\r\nresolve never to become slaves; and do associate, under all the ties\r\nof religion, honor, and love of our country, to adopt and endeavor to\r\ncarry into execution whatever measures are recommended by the\r\nContinental Congress, or resolved upon by our Provincial Convention,\r\nfor the purpose of preserving our Constitution, and opposing the\r\nexecution of the several arbitrary acts of the British Parliament,\r\nuntil a reconciliation between Great Britain and America, on\r\nconstitutional principles (which we most ardently desire) can be\r\nobtained; and that we will in all things follow the advice of our\r\nGeneral Committee respecting the purposes aforesaid, the preservation\r\nof peace and good order, and the safety of individuals and property.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indian Fort Built Between 1761 and 1765, Port Jervis]\r\n\r\nWhen the signed pledges were returned to the Provincial Convention in\r\nNew York it invested the committees of safety with power to appoint\r\nassessors and collectors, and these, with the committees, were\r\ndirected to assess, raise and collect the quotas required for the\r\nsupport of the home government, and empowered to enforce collection\r\nfrom defaulters by \"distress upon their goods and chattels.\" They\r\nmight also arrest persons inimical to the measures which had been or\r\nmight be taken. These powers were afterward enlarged by Congress, and\r\nthe committees empowered to suppress the enemies of the revolutionary\r\ngovernment. Legislative duties devolved upon the Provincial\r\nConvention until 1777, when the first Constitution of New York was\r\nadopted, and meanwhile the committees of safety attended to the\r\nexecution of its laws. Methods differed somewhat in different\r\ncounties. In Orange the precincts chose committees, and these\r\nconstituted the county committee. A signature to the pledge\r\nformulated by Congress was regarded as evidence of loyalty to the\r\nrevolutionary cause.\r\n\r\nIn the precinct lists of the Orange County signers of the pledge the\r\nsignatures in Goshen embraced the present towns of Goshen, Chester,\r\nWarwick, Wawayanda, Greenville, and a part of Blooming Grove; in\r\nMamakating those of Mt. Hope and Deer Park; Cornwall and Highlands\r\nwere included in Cornwall; in Monroe parts of Blooming Grove and the\r\npresent county of Rockland; in Newburgh, New Windsor and Wallkill\r\nwith Newburgh.

James Clinton, Capt. James McClaughry, John Nicoll,\r\nJohn Nicholson, Nathan Smith, Robert Boyd, Jr., Samuel Brewster,\r\nSamuel Sly, Samuel Logan. In May, 1776, the committee became: Samuel\r\nBrewster, chairman; Robert Boyd, Jr., Nathan Smith, Hugh Humphrey,\r\nGeorge Denniston, John Nicholl, Col. James McClaughry, Samuel Arthur.\r\n\r\nIn the precinct of Mamakating, John Young, chairman of committee,\r\ncertified that the pledge was signed by all the freeholders and\r\ninhabitants of the precinct, June 26, 1775.\r\n\r\nIn the precinct of Goshen the committee appointed September 14, 1775,\r\nconsisted in part of Isaac Nicoll, Benjamin Gale, Moses Hetfield,\r\nDaniel Everett, James Little, Joshua Davis, with Daniel Everett as\r\nChairman. Later the names of John Hathorn, John Jackson, Henry\r\nWisner, John Minthornes and Nathaniel Ketchum were chairman at\r\ndifferent times.\r\n\r\nIn the Cornwall precinct, 1775, the committee consisted of Hezekiah\r\nHowell, Archibald Little, Elihu Marvin, Nathaniel Satterly, Nathaniel\r\nStrong, Jonathan Brooks, Stephen Gilbert, Zachariah Du Bois, with\r\nThomas Moffat as chairman.\r\n\r\nIn the precinct of Hanover no names of pledge-signers were reported,\r\nbut the committee, appointed May 8, 1775, consisted of Dr. Charles\r\nClinton, chairman; Alexander Trimble, Arthur Parks, William Jackson,\r\nHenry Smith, Jacob Newkirk, James Latta, Philip Mole, John Wilkin,\r\nJames McBride, James Milliken, Samuel Barkley.\r\n\r\nIn the precinct of Wallkill there was no return of pledge-signers,\r\nbut the committee, Jan. 30, 1775, consisted of Abimael Youngs,\r\nchairman; James Wilkins, Hezekiah Gale, Moses Phillips, Henry Wisner,\r\nJr.\r\n\r\nThe county committee of Orange in 1776 had Elihu Marvin, of Cornwall,\r\nfor chairman, and David Pye was deputy chairman for Haverstraw and\r\nOrangetown. Robert Boyd, of New Windsor, was chairman for Ulster\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nThe Committees of Safety and Observation began immediately to gather\r\narms, and later to arrest inimical or suspected persons and bring\r\nthem to trial.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the inhabitants of Orange and Ulster Counties\r\nwere loyal, earnest and active for the cause of Independence. In the\r\nearly years of the war the militia was efficient in guarding the\r\nfrontiers, constructing Highland forts and placing obstructions to\r\nnavigation in the Hudson River; and two of the companies took part\r\nin the expedition to Canada of 1775. In 1776 one-fourth of the\r\nmilitia of the two counties was \"drawn out for the defense of the\r\nState\" and stationed along the Highlands. They consisted of two\r\nregiments from Orange commanded by Colonel Isaac Nicoll, and one\r\nfrom Ulster commanded by Colonel Levi Paulding. In December, after\r\nthe British had captured New York, a more general requisition was\r\nmade, and men were obliged to leave their families and stock\r\nunprovided for, which caused great disaffection for a time; but\r\nafter General Washington's victory at Trenton they were permitted to\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 George and James Clinton were in command on the west side of\r\nthe Hudson, and General Putnam on the east side. Burgoyne, with an\r\narmy of 3,000 men, marching down from Canada, had reached Saratoga,\r\nand Howe, with another army, was marching to capture Philadelphia,\r\nwhen, about September 20, 3,000 British and Hessian soldiers arrived\r\nin New York and joined the army of Sir Henry Clinton. Thus reinforced\r\nClinton soon started to force his way up the Hudson, and on October\r\n6, approached Forts Montgomery and Clinton, defended by some 400 of\r\nColonel Du Bois's Regiment and Lamb's Artillery, and about 200\r\nmilitia, mostly from Orange and Ulster Counties. They made a gallant\r\ndefense, but finally overwhelmed by superior numbers, were obliged to\r\nretreat, leaving behind them 300 in killed, wounded and prisoners. In\r\nGovernor Clinton's report to General Washington of the fight at Fort\r\nMontgomery he said that Sir Henry Clinton commanded in person; that\r\nthe enemy was repeatedly driven back by grape shot from a field-piece\r\nand the well-directed fire of musketry during their approach; that\r\nthe militia retreated to the fort, when a demand to surrender was\r\nrefused; and that the enemy's superior numbers finally forced the\r\nworks on all sides. If expected reinforcements had reached the fort\r\nit was believed that the enemy would have been defeated. Many\r\nmilitiamen were in the mountains, but their communications had been\r\ncut off. There were not more than 600 men in both the forts, while\r\nthe attacking army numbered 3,000. Governor Clinton escaped across\r\nthe Hudson, and many of his men were bayoneted after the works were\r\ntaken. DuBois's Continental Regiment and Lamb's Artillery bore the\r\nbrunt of the fight. The following other regiments were represented in\r\nsmall numbers; Colonel Allison's from Goshen, commanded by himself;\r\nColonel James Clinton's from New Windsor, commanded by Lieutenant\r\nColonel James McClaughry; Colonel Harbourg's from Newburgh, commanded\r\nby Colonel Masten; Colonel Jesse Woodhull's from Cornwall, commanded\r\nby Colonel Dubois.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Clinton's ships moved on up the Hudson, and Putnam's and\r\nClinton's troops followed. The British Commander caused Kingston to\r\nbe burned, and here, receiving the news of Burgoyne's surrender,\r\nturned back. His army tarried a few days in the Highlands to\r\ncomplete the destruction of the forts, and then sailed to New York,\r\nand the militia returned home.\r\n\r\nThe Indians on the western frontier of Orange and beyond were still\r\nnursing grievances against the colonists, and were easily won over to\r\nthe British side by diplomatic agents. Their depredations began again\r\nin 1777, when the family of a Mr. Sprague in the northern part of the\r\nMinisink was attacked and some of them taken prisoners. Next they\r\nkilled some of the family of a Mr. Brooks, and took the rest\r\nprisoners. In 1778 the upper Minisink was invaded by about 100\r\nIndians, under the famous warrior chief, Brandt, and on Oct. 13 they\r\nattacked two dwellings, killed three persons and destroyed much grain\r\nand stock. The settlers repaired to the forts of Gumaer's and\r\nDe Witt's, and the Indians after following and firing a few times at\r\nthem from a distance, went away.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Safety for Minisink in 1778 consisted of Benjamin\r\nDepuy, Philip Swartwout and Ezekiel Gumaer, and they ordered the\r\nerection of five forts, three in the upper neighborhood, and two in\r\nthe lower. These could not accommodate all of the fifty families in\r\nwhat is now Deer Park, and many women and children were sent to the\r\nolder settlements. Scouting parties were sent out under command of\r\nCaptain Bezaliel Tyler, and persons suspected of aiding the Indians\r\nwere imprisoned or banished. Small companies of nine months militia\r\nwere obtained to garrison the forts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Webb Horton]\r\n\r\nThe massacre of Wyoming in July, and the horrible cruelties practiced\r\nupon some of the prisoners, had caused grave apprehensions, and these\r\nwere increased by the coming of Brandt and his Indians in October.\r\nCount Pulaski and his cavalry legion were sent to Minisink, and\r\nremained there during the winter of 1778-9, and Colonel Van\r\nCortlandt's Regiment was sent to Wawarsing. In the spring Count\r\nPulaski and his legion were ordered to South Carolina, and on July\r\n19 Brandt, aware of the poorly defended Minisink, came with\r\nsixty-five Indian warriors and twenty-seven Tories disguised as\r\nIndians, to the lower section, now Deer Park, south of the Neversink\r\nand while the settlers were asleep set fire to several dwellings.\r\nSome of the inmates were killed as they were fleeing and others were\r\ntaken prisoners. The cattle were driven off, and much booty carried\r\nto Brandt's headquarters, Grassy Brook, on the Delaware. When news of\r\nthe murderous raid was received by the militia, a council was held by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Tusten of Colonel Allison's Goshen Regiment,\r\nColonel John Hathorn of the Warwick Regiment, and Captain Meeker of\r\nthe New Jersey militia, and contrary to Tusten's advice, it was\r\ndecided to march against the Indians with such numbers of men as\r\ncould be quickly brought together. Meanwhile Brandt's force had been\r\nincreased to about 300 Indians, and 200 Tories painted to resemble\r\nIndians. The small band of militiamen, commanded by Colonel Hathorn,\r\nmarched to the hills overlooking the Delaware near the mouth of the\r\nLackawaxen, and then discovered Brandt and his warriors\r\nthree-fourths of a mile away. Colonel Hathorn prepared to attack\r\nthem, but Brandt outmaneuvered him, and cut off fifty of his men,\r\nleaving only ninety in the fight that followed. Brandt got in their\r\nrear, and hemmed them in on a rocky slope, with the advantages of\r\nposition and more than five times as many men. When their ammunition\r\nwas exhausted they formed in a hollow square to fight with clubbed\r\nmuskets, but the square was soon broken and the men sought safety in\r\nflight. Tusten was killed by the Indians while dressing wounds of his\r\nmen behind a rock, as were also seventeen wounded men with him.\r\nOthers were shot or drowned in trying to swim across the Delaware.\r\nOnly about thirty survived.\r\n\r\nIn Colonel Hathorn's report of the fight to Governor Clinton he says\r\nthat \"the enemy repeatedly advanced to from forty to one hundred\r\nyards distance and was as repeatedly repulsed\"; that his men\r\n\"defended the ground nearly three hours and a half and during the\r\nwhole time one blaze without intermission was kept up on both sides.\"\r\nThis was at the last stand on the slope. Hathorn's men had been\r\nfiring for five hours, when, ammunition being almost exhausted, he\r\nordered that no one fire \"without having his object sure.\" Soon they\r\nwere forced to retreat down the hill towards the river, and\r\nscattered, every man for himself. Colonel Hathorn further says:\r\n\r\n\"The Indians were under the command of Brandt, who was either killed\r\nor wounded in the action. They burnt Major Decker's house, barn and\r\nmill, James Van Vlock's house and barn, Daniel Vanoker's barn (here\r\nwere two Indians killed from a little fort around the house, which\r\nwas saved). Esquire Cuykindall's house and barn, Simon Westfall's\r\nhouse and barn, the church, Peter Cuykindall's house and barn;\r\nMartinus Decker's fort, house, barn and saw-mills, and Nehemiah\r\nPatterson's saw-mill; killed and scalped, Jeremiah Vanoker, Daniel\r\nCole, Ephriam Ferguson and one Tavern, and took with them several\r\nprisoners, mostly children, with a great number of horses, cattle\r\nand valuable plunder. Some of the cattle we rescued and returned to\r\nthe owners.\"\r\n\r\nA list of the names of the killed has been preserved, and is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nKilled in Minisink Fight.\r\n\r\n Col.

Benjamin Dunning.\r\n Ensign Ephraim Middaugh.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that Joseph Brandt secretly visited the Minisink\r\nsome time before his second invasion, and was cared for by a Tory,\r\nand thus became well informed of the condition of the region. Brandt\r\nwas supposed to be a half-breed, with a German father, but later he\r\nwas believed to be a pure Mohawk Indian. He was educated at Dartmouth\r\nCollege, and at the commencement of the Revolution received a British\r\nappointment as Colonel of the Six Nations. He was a Free Mason, but\r\nneither this nor a good education tamed his savage nature. Dr. Wilson\r\nsaid of him: \"He was more cunning than the fox and fiercer than the\r\ntiger.\"\r\n\r\nDetachments from Woodhull's, Allison's and Hathorn's Regiments were\r\nsent to guard the frontier, but Sullivan's expedition up the\r\nSusquehanna and to the Genesee Valley drew the attention of Brandt,\r\nand he and his Indians did not return.\r\n\r\nThe jails at Goshen and Kingston were filled with prisoners, but the\r\nlocal Tories continued to be troublesome, and some of them joined the\r\nBritish Army, while others made predatory excursions from retreats in\r\nthe lower Highlands, covered by the British works at Stony Point and\r\nFort Lee, and became a terror to the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe residents of this portion of the country and on down the Ramapo\r\nValley were mostly Tories, and in this defile in that region known as\r\nthe \"Clove,\" the Tory Moody intercepted an express from Washington to\r\nCongress regarding an interview about the land and naval forces of\r\nFrance. This messenger was intended by Washington to be captured,\r\nand the news thus obtained caused the withdrawal of a portion of the\r\nforces under Cornwallis, rendering easier the capture of the latter\r\nat Yorktown. Claudius Smith and his sons, who had their headquarters\r\nin the Clove, were the boldest and most successful of its Tories.\r\nSmith was a large, powerful and shrewd man and while he committed\r\nmany crimes and did many hazardous things, yet for a long time\r\nmanaged to escape capture. In October, 1778, Governor Clinton,\r\nenraged at Smith's depredations, offered a reward for his arrest and\r\nthat of his two sons, Richard and James. Alarmed by this, Smith fled\r\nto Long Island, was recognized there, and seized in the night in bed.\r\nHe was tried for one of his crimes at Goshen in January, 1779, and\r\nexecuted on the 22nd of the same month. Five of his associates were\r\nexecuted with him--Matthew Dolson, John Ryan, Thomas Delamar, John\r\nGordon and Amy Angor. Retribution followed soon on all Smith's band.\r\nHis son William was shot in the mountains, and his son James was\r\nprobably executed in Goshen soon after his father, with James\r\nFlewelling and William Cole. Silas Gardner, however, who was tried\r\nand sentenced as a Tory, was pardoned, but the rest were slain or\r\ndriven from the country. Claudius Smith commenced his depredations in\r\nthe interest of the British in 1776, and first appeared on the\r\npublic records, charged with stealing, in 1777. He was confined in\r\nthe Kingston jail, and transferred from there to the Goshen jail,\r\nfrom which he escaped. He was said to be the friend of the poor,\r\ngiving liberally to them of what he stole from the rich. Many\r\nexciting stories were told of his doings.\r\n\r\nOne of the most brilliant exploits of the war was the night assault\r\non Stony Point, twelve miles below West Point, and now a State\r\nreservation in Rockland County. This was on July 16-17, 1779. It had\r\nbeen occupied by British troops since Clinton's expedition up the\r\nHudson in 1777, and was regarded as almost impregnable. \"Mad\" Anthony\r\nWayne headed the enterprise, and it was carried out in substantial\r\naccordance with a general plan which had been suggested by General\r\nWashington. The fort was garrisoned by 700 men, who had fifteen\r\npieces of artillery on the heights. Their surprise was complete, and\r\nthe capture quickly accomplished. The American loss was 15 killed and\r\n83 wounded; that of the British 63 killed, 61 wounded and 575 made\r\nprisoners, only one of the garrison managing to escape. The works\r\nwere destroyed and the place evacuated. In July, 1779, the British\r\nreoccupied it, and began to build defenses, but were soon withdrawn\r\nbecause of the coming of the French fleet, and the Americans took\r\npossession and began restoring the fortifications.\r\n\r\nArnold's treason was discovered Sept. 23d, 1780, and Stony Point was\r\nincluded in the fortifications which he intended to betray. His\r\ntreason, his conference with Major Andre below Stony Point, Andre's\r\nstay at Hett Smith's house, his capture at Tarrytown and brief\r\nconfinement at West Point, Arnold's flight and Andre's trial and\r\nexecution, are too familiar to the readers of American history to\r\nrequire recapitulation here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Devon]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n THE WAR OF 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding other ostensible causes, it was really necessary to\r\ncomplete the independence of the United States, only partly effected\r\nby the War of the Revolution, that the War of 1812 should be begun\r\nand fought out. Great Britain claimed the right to search American\r\nships, impress American seamen into her service, and make prizes of\r\nall American vessels going to or from France or her allies which did\r\nnot clear from or touch English ports. France issued retaliatory\r\ndecrees which were more damaging to America than England. They\r\ndeclared that its vessels which had touched English ports or\r\nsubmitted to be searched by an English ship should be the property\r\nof France, and that English goods, wherever found, should be subject\r\nto confiscation. Thus endangered by the policy of both nations,\r\nCongress in 1809 declared an embargo prohibiting American vessels\r\nfrom sailing from foreign ports, and foreign ships from carrying away\r\nAmerican cargoes--a law which virtually suspended our commerce and\r\nexposed our merchants to the risks of bankruptcy. England gave notice\r\nto the President that her claims before stated would be adhered to,\r\nand Congress, seeing no other means of redress, formally declared war\r\non June 18, 1812.\r\n\r\nOrange County citizens had given expression to their views on the\r\nembargo act in March, 1800. A Republican county convention held at\r\nGoshen selected General Hathorn as its chairman, and a committee on\r\nresolutions was appointed consisting of Jonathan Fisk, Colonel John\r\nNicholson, General Reuben Hopkins and Judge Nathan White. The\r\nresolutions reported and adopted asserted that the American embargo\r\nwas \"a wise and patriotic measure, imperiously demanded by the exposed\r\ncondition of our seamen, shipping and trade to the audacious outrages\r\nof foreign powers.\" In the Federal party's county convention, held\r\nlater, Daniel Niven was chairman, and its committee on resolutions\r\nconsisted of John Barber, Alexander R. Thompson, Alanson Austin, John\r\nBradner, J. N. Phillips, John Morrison, John Duer, Samuel Saver, James\r\nStorey, Solomon Sleight, John Decker and Samuel B. Stickney. The\r\nresolutions protested against the enforcement of the embargo, as\r\n\"unjust, illegal and oppressive, subversive of the rights and\r\ndangerous to the liberties of the people.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the war came the views of many of the Federalists had\r\nchanged, and they sustained the Government.\r\n\r\nThe first call for troops was made April 21, 1812, when the militia\r\nwas arranged in two divisions and eight brigades, and the brigades\r\nwere divided into twenty regiments. The second brigade of the first\r\ndivision, embracing the militia of Orange and Ulster, under Brigadier\r\nGeneral Hopkins of Goshen, was organized as the Fourth Regiment, and\r\nits Commander was Lieutenant Colonel Andrew J. Hardenburgh of\r\nShawangunk. In 1813 and 1814, Lieutenant Colonel Isaac Belknap took\r\nthe place of Lieutenant Colonel Hardenburgh. The cavalry and\r\nartillery were similarly organized.\r\n\r\nThe second call was made in July, 1813, and the third in July, 1814,\r\nwhen the places of rendezvous were Newburgh and New Windsor, and from\r\nthese the men were moved on sloops to New York and assigned to the\r\nneighboring fortifications. They embarked Aug. 28, and returned Dec.\r\n4, having been absent only a little more than three months.\r\n\r\nAmong the uniformed companies at that time were the following: Orange\r\nHussars of Montgomery, Captain William Trimble (succeeded by Captain\r\nMilliken); Captain Van Orsdal's and Captain Dorcas's companies of\r\ninfantry of Montgomery; Captain Kerr's company of artillery of New\r\nWindsor; Captain Butterworth's company of artillery of Newburgh;\r\nCaptain Westcott's company of cavalry of Goshen; Captain Acker's\r\ncompany of cavalry of Newburgh and Marlborough; Captain Denniston and\r\nCaptain Birdsall's companies of infantry of Newburgh.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Captain Westcott was afterwards appointed Major of\r\nthe first regiment of cavalry, when Charles Lindsay was made captain\r\nof his company; Joseph H. Jackson, first lieutenant; Daniel McNeal,\r\nsecond lieutenant, and Stephen P. Rockefellow, cornet, all being\r\nresidents of Montgomery except Major Westcott.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signing of the Wawayanda Patent]\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1812, Captain Denniston of the \"Republican Blues\"\r\nenlisted about fifty volunteers to serve one year or during the war,\r\nand they elected Jonathan Gidney captain. They formed part of a\r\ndetached regiment of riflemen of which Captain Denniston became\r\nmajor and afterwards colonel.\r\n\r\nA part of a company from Wallkill was included in Colonel\r\nHardenburgh's Ulster regiment, which went to Plattsburgh and thence\r\nto Fort Hamilton, near the Canada line, for guard duty.\r\n\r\nThe following roll of a detached company in Colonel Michael Smith's\r\nregiment of infantry, mustered in in September, 1814, embraces men\r\nfrom both Orange and Ulster Counties:\r\n\r\nRoll of Detached Company.\r\n\r\n Dunning, John, Captain.

Robert Ludlow was\r\non the \"Constitution\" when she captured the \"Java,\" and Augustus C.\r\nLudlow as a lieutenant distinguished himself as a hero in the action\r\nof the \"Chesapeake\" with the \"Shannon.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the British captured Washington in 1814, a public meeting was\r\nheld in Goshen, August 30, to consider the propriety of repairing the\r\nfortifications at West Point or erecting new ones for public defense.\r\nGeneral James W. Wilson was chairman of the meeting, and a committee\r\nto devise and report plans was composed of John Duer, Jonathan Fisk,\r\nWilliam Ross, John W. Wilkin, George D. Wickham, James Finch, Jr.,\r\nand Nathan H. White. They reported at an adjourned meeting, and\r\nrecommended the following committee of defense, which was appointed:\r\n\r\nFor Minisink, John Bradner, Nathan Arnot; Deer Park, John Finch, Jr.,\r\nJoseph Baird; Wallkill, Henry B. Wisner, Benjamin Woodward; Goshen,\r\nJohn Duer, Freegift Tuthill; Warwick, Dr. Samuel S. Seward, Jeffrey\r\nWisner; Monroe, James D. Secor, Benjamin Cunningham; Cornwall,\r\nWilliam A. Clark, Joseph Chandler, Jr.; Blooming Grove, Col. Selah\r\nStrong, Jeremiah Horton; Montgomery, John Blake, Jr., Johannes\r\nMiller; Newburgh, John D. Lawson, Jacob Powell; New Windsor, Joseph\r\nMorton, David Hill.\r\n\r\nThis Committee of Defense met September 7, and made Selah Strong its\r\nchairman and John Duer its secretary. It passed resolutions in\r\nharmony with those of the public meeting, and appointed the chairman,\r\nthe secretary, William A. Clark, Joseph Morell and Johannes Miller a\r\ncommittee to tender the services of citizens in repairing the West\r\nPoint fortifications. At another meeting, September 17, the committee\r\ninstructed the town committees immediately to collect subscriptions\r\nof money and labor, and report them to the General Committee, and\r\nalso inquire into and report the quantity of arms and ammunition\r\nwhich the respective towns might need.\r\n\r\nOctober 25 it was reported from the Secretary of War that he would\r\nsend a skillful engineer to West Point \"to superintend the works and\r\npoint out the sites most eligible for defense.\"\r\n\r\nLittle was done, however, at West Point, but military companies of\r\nexempts were organized in several towns.\r\n\r\nThe glad news of the treaty of peace, concluded in December, 1814,\r\nwas celebrated in every town of the county with great enthusiasm, and\r\nincluded illuminations, cannon firing, speeches, toasts, and\r\nthanksgiving services in the churches.\r\n\r\nPeace with other nations continued from the close of the War of 1812\r\nuntil the war with Mexico, 1846-8. For this war New York City\r\nregiments drew a number of volunteers from Orange, but only one\r\ncompany was recruited in the county, and this was in Goshen, and it\r\nbecame Co. K of the 10th Regiment U. S. Infantry. Its captain was\r\nAlexander Wilkin and its lieutenant, Francis M. Cummins. Captain\r\nWilkin resigned in April, 1848, and Lieutenant Cummins was promoted\r\nto the captaincy. The regiment with this company was attached to the\r\nArmy of the Rio Grande under General Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n THE CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic services of the people of Orange County in the\r\nfour-years' Civil War of 1861-5 were as praiseworthy as those of\r\ntheir ancestors in the two wars with Great Britain, which founded the\r\nRepublic upon a lasting basis of unparalleled prosperity and\r\nprogress. It was as necessary for the continuance of that prosperity,\r\nand as a lesson of our republican experiment to the world, to defeat\r\nthe efforts of the slave-holding States to rend the Union in twain,\r\nas it had been to compel the kingly power across the ocean to let us\r\nestablish it. This Orange County was quick to perceive and act upon.\r\n\r\nIts Co. B, Third Regiment of Infantry, was the first company\r\nrecruited and ready for muster in the State. Recruiting for it was\r\ncommenced in Newburgh immediately after the passage by the\r\nLegislature, April 16, 1861, of an act to authorize the equipment of\r\nvolunteer militia for the public safety, the movement being started\r\nby Hon. Stephen W. Fullerton, Member of Assembly, and placed in\r\ncharge of James A. Ramney. There were seventy-seven men enrolled when\r\nthe company was mustered in for two years, May 14, 1861--less than\r\none month from the day the first man enlisted, and it had then been\r\nready several days for mustering in.\r\n\r\nThe following regiments and companies were recruited in Orange for\r\nthe Civil War, and there were many other enlistments from the county\r\nin other regiments and in the Navy:\r\n\r\nInfantry: Third Regiment, Co. B, 1861; 18th, Co. D and Co. H, in\r\npart, 1861; 36th, Co. B, 1861; 56th, Cos. A, B, D and E, 1861; 63d\r\nRegiment, 1864; 70th, Co. F, 1861; 87th, Co. C, 1861; 98th, Co. C,\r\n1864; 124th Regiment, 1,047 men in 1862 and one company in 1864;\r\n168th, 335 men, 1862; 176th, 272 men, 1862.\r\n\r\nMounted Rifles: First Regiment, Co. C, 1861.\r\n\r\nCavalry: Second Regiment, Co. B, 1861; 15th, Co. I, 146 men, 1864.\r\n\r\nArtillery: Fifteenth Regiment, Co. M, 82 men, 1864; 7th, 70 men,\r\n1864; 7th Independent Battery, 1861.\r\n\r\nMilitia: Nineteenth and 71st, 517 men, 1861-62.\r\n\r\nThe following are the aggregates by towns of the men furnished and\r\naccepted in the county:\r\n\r\n     April, 1861, to July, 1862.\r\n\r\n Towns.

It\r\nwas in many fights, including those of Big Bethel, Fort Wagner,\r\nBermuda Hundred, Petersburg, Fort Gilmer, Chapin's Farm, Fort Fisher\r\nand Wilmington. Its first captain, Stephen W. Fullerton, appointed\r\nApril 20, 1861, died in Newburgh, September 11, 1861, and was\r\nsucceeded by Ervine A. Jones, first lieutenant, September 25, 1861,\r\nwho was dismissed August 16, 1862. Alexander Mann, second and then\r\nfirst lieutenant, was promoted to captain, June 10, 1861, and\r\ndischarged August 31, 1864. Jeremiah D. Mabie, who was promoted from\r\nfirst sergeant to second lieutenant, and then to first lieutenant of\r\nCo. B, was made captain of Co. F, June 15, 1863, and discharged\r\nSeptember 18, 1864. James H. Reeve was advanced from fourth sergeant\r\nto first sergeant and then to second lieutenant of Co. B, was made\r\ncaptain of Co. I, October 3, 1864, lost a leg at Fort Fisher, and was\r\ndischarged June 26, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe Eighteenth Regiment was recruited in several counties in\r\nresponse to the call of President Lincoln for 75,000 volunteers. It\r\nwas mustered in for two years May 17, 1861, and mustered out May 28,\r\n1863. Co. D was recruited from Orange County and organized at\r\nMiddletown, with John C. McGinnis, captain, George Barry, first\r\nlieutenant and Roswell M. Sayre, second lieutenant. The commissions\r\nof these officers date back into April. The enlistments were so many\r\nthat thirty men of the company were separated to form a part of Co.\r\nH. The regiment supported a battery in the first battle of Bull Run,\r\nbut was not brought into action. It was stationed and remained near\r\nAlexandria the most of the time until McClellan's Army went to the\r\nPeninsula, and took part there in the seven days' fighting. Afterward\r\nit did guard duty at various points until it was mustered out.\r\n\r\nThe following promotions of Orange County men in the 18th Regiment\r\nare on record, the dates being those of rank, some of which preceded\r\ndates of commission:\r\n\r\nThomas S. Lane, 2d Lieut., Nov. 6, 1861; 1st Lieut., Nov. 10, 1862;\r\nmustered out with regiment.\r\n\r\nW. E. Carmichael, 2d Lieut., May 7, 1861; 1st Lieut., Dec. 2, 1861;\r\nresigned May 16, 1862.\r\n\r\nRobert A. Malone, 2d Lieut., Nov. 11, 1861; Capt., Sept. 8, 1862;\r\nmustered out with regiment.\r\n\r\nRoswell M. Sayre, 2d Lieut., April 30, 1861; 1st Lieut., Dec. 21,\r\n1862; Capt., June 26, 1862; mustered out with regiment.\r\n\r\nJohn S. King, 1st Lieut., June 26, 1862; mustered out with regiment.\r\n\r\nGeorge Barry, 1st Lieut., April 30, 1861; killed at Gaines Mills, June\r\n27, 1862.\r\n\r\nJohn C. McGinnis, Capt., April 30, 1861; Major, Dec. 2, 1861; Lieut.\r\nCol., Oct. 14, 1862; mustered out with regiment.\r\n\r\nThe 36th Regiment was organized in New York, and its Co. B was\r\nrecruited in Orange County by John Raney of Newburgh, captain of Co.\r\nF, 19th Militia, assisted by Timothy Donoghue of the same company.\r\nThe enlistments were for two years. Between May 13 and June 17, 1861,\r\nthey enlisted seventy-seven men. The regiment arrived in Washington,\r\nJuly 14, 1861, and remained in camp until March, 1862. It was\r\nbrigaded under General Couch, and attached to General Buell's\r\nDivision, afterward commanded by General Keyes. It went with General\r\nMcClellan's Army to the Peninsula and was in the fights at Seven\r\nPines, Gaines Mills and Malvern Hill. Afterward it saw much active\r\nand perilous service in Virginia and Maryland. At Fredericksburg it\r\nwas in General Deven's Brigade, which was the first of the left\r\ngrand division to cross the Rappahannock, December 11, 1862, and\r\ncovered the retreat of the army, December 15, Co. B being detailed to\r\ncollect stragglers under the enemy's fire. May 3, Co. B, at Marye's\r\nHeights, captured a battery from a Mississippi brigade, and was the\r\nfirst to raise the colors on the heights. The regiment was a part of\r\nSedgwick's Corps in the attack on Salem Heights. The last active\r\nservice of the regiment and Co. B was in Hooker's campaign. The\r\nofficers of the company were:\r\n\r\nJohn A. Raney, Capt., June 15, 1861; Major, Dec. 21, 1861; resigned\r\nOct. 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nTimothy Donoghue, 1st Lieut., June 15, 1861; Capt., Nov. 12, 1861;\r\nmustered out with regiment, July 15, 1863.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Lewis, 2d Lieut., June 15, 1864; 1st Lieut., Dec. 2, 1861;\r\nmustered out with regiment.\r\n\r\nCharles B. Lewis, 1st Sergt., Oct. 1, 1861; 2d Lieut., Nov. 12, 1861;\r\n1st Lieut, Aug. 20, 1862; mustered out with regiment.\r\n\r\n  FIFTY-SIXTH REGIMENT.\r\n\r\nThe 56th Regiment was formed of companies from Orange, Ulster,\r\nSullivan and Delaware Counties, Companies A, B, D and E being\r\nrecruited from Orange, as were also the 7th Battery and Co. C of\r\nMounted Rifles, afterward detached. It was a three-years' regiment,\r\nbut was continued by re-enlistment, and although the companies were\r\nall mustered in between July 31st and December 10th, 1861, the\r\nregiment was not mustered out until October 17th, 1865. Its services\r\nin the army were varied and creditable throughout, and at times\r\nbrilliant, and deserved the detailed record of its movements,\r\nhardships, perils and achievements in the history by John C. Fisk\r\nand William H. D. Blake, members of the regiment, which was published\r\nin 1906. It is this well-written history herein epitomized.\r\n\r\nThe 56th Regiment, first known as the Tenth Legion, was organized in\r\nJuly, 1861, by Charles H. Van Wyck, with headquarters at Newburgh. It\r\nconsisted of ten companies of infantry, one of sharpshooters, two of\r\nartillery and two of cavalry, when it went away, but in Washington\r\nthe four latter companies were detached and placed in the artillery\r\ndivision and cavalry corps. Its camp of rendezvous and instruction\r\nuntil November 6th was on a sandy plateau by the Hudson River, near\r\nNew Windsor. In Washington it was made a part of the Provisional\r\nBrigade, including also the 52nd and 104th Pennsylvania, the 11th\r\nMaine and the 100th New York Regiments. The 56th New York was\r\ncommanded by Colonel Charles H. Van Wyck until he was brevetted a\r\nBrigadier General. Companies A, B and E were recruited in Newburgh\r\nby Recruiting Officers Thomas S. Marvel, Charles T. Thayer and\r\nWilliam J. Williams, respectively; Co. C of mounted rifles in\r\nMontgomery by Frederick Decker, and Co. D in Warwick by John J.\r\nWheeler.\r\n\r\nThe instructing officer at the New Windsor camp was Charles A. Van\r\nHorne Ellis, of the 71st New York Militia, and he proved to be an\r\nefficient drill-master in regimental and company movements and the\r\nmanual of arms, in which officers and men made rapid progress and\r\nbecame expert before leaving for the seat of war. When the regiment\r\nreached New York General Stuart L. Woodford presented to it a white\r\nsilk banner in behalf of a patriotic society called \"The Sons of\r\nOrange and Sullivan,\" and this was carried through the whole war. On\r\narriving in Washington in November the regiment was sent to Kalorama\r\nHeights, near Georgetown, and tented there about two weeks. The\r\nweather was severe, and many of the men contracted colds, pneumonia\r\nand rheumatism from unaccustomed exposures, which also proved fatal\r\nto some of them. Afterward they camped a few weeks by Rock Creek, in\r\nthe suburbs of Georgetown, and in January, 1862, went into the\r\nCarver barracks on Meridian Hill. The brigade, under General Naglee,\r\nhad then become one of the best-drilled in the army, and President\r\nLincoln and family and General Scott and daughter repeatedly came to\r\nMeridian Hill to witness its parade. It was in the grand review of\r\n140,000 men under General McClellan which preceded the movement to\r\nthe Peninsula, and on March 26th crossed the Long Bridge in Casey's\r\ndivision of four brigades, which marched thence to Alexandria, where\r\non April 1st they started down the Potomac on the steamer\r\n\"Constitution\" for the Peninsula, reached Hampton Roads in the\r\nevening of April 2nd, and proceeded to Newport News April 3d. On\r\nthis last trip the men had their first experience under fire, but the\r\nshells which the rebels shot at them from Sewell's Point fell short.\r\n\r\nAt Newport News they went into camp on a large plantation, waited for\r\nthe rest of the army a few days, and marched with it to Yorktown.\r\nHere the men on picket line were almost constantly under fire, and\r\nall were kept in a fever of excitement by the roar of cannon and\r\ncracks of rifles along the whole line from river to river, day and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe first real baptism of fire experienced by the 56th was on April\r\n16th, when a large force of the enemy came out and fell on the left\r\nof the division near Lee's Mills. The rebels were repulsed, and the\r\nofficers commended the men of the regiment for their courage and\r\nsteadiness under fire. May 5th they had more fighting experience\r\nafter a swift march of the day before to the front of Fort McGruder\r\nin the suburbs of Williamsburgh. Here they took part in a charge on\r\ntheir enemies with fixed bayonets, which caused the latter to flee in\r\nconfusion leaving many dead and wounded and about 600 prisoners. They\r\nremained in line of battle all night, standing in deep mud, and\r\ndrenched by a drizzling rain. When, the next afternoon, they were\r\neach given three biscuits of hardtack it was the first food they had\r\neaten in two days, and ended the first experience of intense gnawing\r\nhunger with the most of them. May 9th they followed the retreating\r\nrebels over roads deep with mud, exchanging shots with them day after\r\nday, sleeping on the ground at night, wading streams waist-deep\r\nsometimes, with little to eat, and much of the time only what they\r\ncould jayhawk. May 19th they drove the enemy across the Chickahominy\r\nat a point opposite Richmond, and as all the bridges had been\r\ndestroyed, waded the next day across the Oozy river without much\r\nopposition, and waited for the rest of the corps, which followed in\r\nthree days, and crossed the river on a bridge which had meanwhile\r\nbeen constructed for them. During the next three days the regiment\r\nwas kept on the move making reconnaissances and scouting, and\r\nscouted to within four miles of the city of Richmond.\r\n\r\nMay 28th the 56th found itself assigned with Casey's division to a\r\nposition on the right of the Williamsburgh turnpike, remained on\r\npicket till sometime after the attack of the 31st and captured a\r\nnumber of the enemy's skirmishers. Later, when the two lines of\r\nbattle were formed, it was placed to support Spratt's battery, but\r\nthe battery's captain relieved it and left the division lying on the\r\nground exposed to the plunging fire of the enemy's artillery, which\r\nkilled the men \"at a fearful rate.\" They then formed in the edge of\r\nthe woods, and there fought two hours, and Colonel Van Wyck was\r\nwounded in the leg by a piece of shell. The division that day opposed\r\na force of 30,000, and held the line. Three times the enemy charged\r\nto within reach of their bayonets, and each time was driven back. The\r\ndivision made one of the most bloody and obstinate fights of the war,\r\nand lost nearly half of its men, but, it was believed, saved the army\r\nof the Potomac from great disaster.\r\n\r\nThen to Malvern Hill. On July 1 the division, after a tedious march,\r\nlay down on the hill near a large house, and there all day witnessed\r\nthe cannonading of 160 Union guns, expecting every moment to be\r\nordered to assist in the frequent fierce assaults made by the Army of\r\nVirginia in three divisions, \"only to be torn in pieces and hurled\r\nback again to the cover of the woods by the awful storm of shot and\r\nshell and volleys of the infantry supports.\" But the brigade was not\r\nmoved from its reserved position until late in the afternoon, when it\r\nwas sent to the southern slope of the hill, and on the 2nd acted as\r\nrear guard of the whole retreating army, being in charge of the\r\nartillery and wagon trains. The enemy's advance attacked it at\r\nCarter's Hill, but was repulsed. The next day breastworks were thrown\r\nup, and the army rested. On July 7th the men were cheered by a visit\r\nand praise from President Lincoln. It was thought that the army would\r\nmove forward and capture Richmond, but General McClellan received\r\norders to withdraw by way of Aquia Creek and attack Richmond from the\r\nRappahannock. The Chickahominy was crossed October 16 in weather so\r\nhot that large numbers of the officers and men dropped by the wayside\r\nexhausted, and that night when the regiment bivouacked not more than\r\n100 men stacked arms, and hardly an officer except the mounted ones\r\nwas with them. Key's corps, including the 56th Regiment, was left at\r\nYorktown to cover the embarkation. The Peninsula campaign was ended.\r\n\r\nGeneral Naglee's brigade remained in and about Yorktown for sometime,\r\ndoing picket duty and demolishing earthworks. On December 11 it went\r\non a raid into Gloucester, Kings and Queens Counties, and brought\r\nback horses, mules, cattle, sheep and fowls. The brigade marched all\r\nnight closely followed by the enemy, the 56th doing excellent service\r\nas the rear guard. On December 29th the brigade embarked on steamer\r\nfor Morehead City, N. C., and went from there to Newbern, near which\r\nit remained two weeks. On January 8, 1863, orders were read informing\r\nthe men of the 56th that their regiment had been attached to the 18th\r\nCorps, 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, with General Naglee as division\r\ncommander, and Colonel Davis of the 104th Pa. as the brigade\r\ncommander. General Naglee, on taking leave, issued an order naming\r\nthe important events in the history of the brigade in which it acted\r\na conspicuous part, and which should be inscribed upon the regimental\r\nbanners. The 56th was included in all of them.\r\n\r\nGeneral Naglee also characterized the work and behavior of the\r\nbrigade in each of the events.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the preparations to attack Charleston the brigade\r\nwent to St. Helena Island and waited there until about April 1st.\r\nThence to woods near the shore of Edisto Harbor, where monitors and\r\ngunboats lay at anchor, and covered its landing by shelling the\r\nwoods. After landing it followed the retreating enemy, and some of\r\nthe men were wounded. While in camp here it was several times\r\nattacked in night forays and some of its picket men captured. Here\r\nthe 56th was temporarily brigaded with that of General Howell in\r\nGeneral Terry's division, under General Gilmore of the Tenth Corps.\r\nOn July 16th, this division, 4,000 strong, was attacked by a\r\nsuperior force of Georgia troops, but with the aid of the gunboats\r\nthey were driven off with a loss of 200 prisoners. Soon afterward the\r\ndivision went to Folly Island, and here, while the bombardment of\r\nForts Wagner and Gregg was in progress, the men were engaged in\r\narduous duties and got but little rest. August 16 they sailed to\r\nBeaufort, S. C., and went into camp, with the regiment sadly reduced\r\nin numbers and many sick. They remained there till September 3, 1864,\r\nwith the exception of an expedition to John's Island in July.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1864, the regiment veteranized,{_sic_} the most of the\r\nmen re-enlisting, and was mustered in as a veteran regiment February\r\n29. In March it went north on a furlough and returned May 18,\r\ncommanded by Colonel Tyler. During its stay at Beaufort about 400 new\r\nmen had been recruited for it by officers sent north. The regiment\r\nwent from Beaufort to John's Island, near Charleston, July 1st, and\r\nhere became a part of J. P. Hatch's division. On July 4th it had the\r\nmost trying march of the year on account of the extreme heat and the\r\nsoft sand. Many of the men were sun-struck, and some of them died.\r\nThe march was continued the next morning to within seven miles of\r\nCharleston, when, hearing that rebel cavalry were in their rear, they\r\nwere ordered back. The next day they started again for the front, and\r\nhad to do some fighting. July 9th they were attacked by the rebels in\r\nforce in a dense fog. A surprise was intended, but the rebels were\r\nmet with volleys of grape and canister, and were twice repulsed. On\r\nJuly 10th, the regiment went back to Beaufort, and the St. John's\r\nexpedition passed into history. It was regarded as the most exciting\r\nand perilous scouting expedition the regiment was ever engaged in,\r\nbut its object was accomplished. It remained at Beaufort until\r\nSeptember 3, when it moved over to Morris Island and assisted in the\r\nsiege of Charleston. Here the men could see every shot from their\r\nbatteries that struck Fort Sumter, and the firing was kept up night\r\nand day. The heat was extreme, the whole island was covered with\r\nshifting sand, which filled eyes, ears and hair, the heavy fogs at\r\nnight were like a drenching rain, and all the while they were under\r\nthe fire of the rebel forts and batteries, shells from which burst\r\nover their heads; but they had the compensation of seeing their own\r\nshells burst in the city of Charleston.\r\n\r\nMany of the men became afflicted with scurvy, and the effective force\r\nof the regiment was reduced to 600 men, one-half of whom were\r\ndetailed each day and night for field duty. Otherwise their duties\r\nwere severe, and in October the nights became very cold, and, being\r\nwithout fuel, caused them much suffering. They remained there until\r\nNovember 27, when they were taken to Boyd's Point, and the next\r\nmorning were marched by General Potter toward Honey Hill, where they\r\nwere surprised by a concealed rebel battery, and there was a bloody\r\nfight in which the 56th lost fifty men in killed and wounded, and the\r\ndivision 746, and they were obliged to fall back. On December 3d the\r\nbrigade, after a lively skirmish, returned to its old camp, and three\r\ndays later went up Broad River to Deveaux Neck, near which it had\r\nmany of its men killed and wounded in a severe fight. The next day it\r\nwas attacked by a large force, and there was a bloody fight in which\r\neach man fired sixty rounds and the rebels were repulsed, but\r\nresisted stubbornly and retired slowly. In this battle the 56th\r\nencountered the 5th Georgia Regiment, drove it from its position,\r\ncaptured its colors, and lost twenty-four men in killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe camp was thirty-six miles north of Savannah and seventy from\r\nCharleston. December 23d the news came that General Sherman had\r\noccupied Savannah. On the 29th Colonel Tyler was put in command of\r\nthree regiments, including the 56th, and they advanced to ascertain\r\nthe strength of the enemy. They encountered his picket line which\r\nresisted but fell back, and killed and wounded seventeen of Tyler's\r\nmen. The camp was undisturbed until January 7th, when a rifled gun\r\nbegan shelling them and kept it up for a week, night and day. This\r\nwas not restful, but the camp was so sandy that not more than half\r\nthe percussion shells burst, and not a man was injured by them.\r\nJanuary 15th it was discovered that the rebels had left, and our men\r\npushed on and took possession of Fort Coosawhatchie. Here the rations\r\nwere greatly improved by foraging expeditions. On the 17th they were\r\nvisited by Generals Sherman and Howard. On the 29th the 56th remained\r\nat the fort while the rest of the brigade left to relieve General\r\nSherman's forces at Poctaligo. The 56th did not join it until\r\nFebruary 16, and afterward the brigade made a slow march to Ashley\r\nRiver, across which lay Charleston, arriving there February 28. The\r\ncity had been evacuated after the cotton warehouses, quartermasters'\r\nstores, bridges, vessels, etc., had been burnt by order of General\r\nHardie. March 1st the division started to pursue him, and if possible\r\nprevent him from joining General Johnston's army. It marched several\r\ndays without finding any rebels, then was ordered to return and was\r\nback in Charleston on the 9th. This expedition, composed of General\r\nPotter's entire division, had marched ninety miles. It went on March\r\n11th to the village of Mt. Pleasant, near Charleston, and remained\r\nthere until April 2nd, when it went to Georgetown. Major Eliphas\r\nSmith being in command of companies A, B, C, D and E of the 56th. A\r\nand B remained in Georgetown as a part of the garrison. C was sent as\r\nguard of a transport up the Santee River, and E and D were attached\r\nto the 157th regiment, and went with it on the \"Kingsville\r\nexpedition.\" Kingsville was about 135 miles from Georgetown, and the\r\nrebels had run in there from points on Sherman's march as many as 25\r\nlocomotives and 200 cars, with large quantities of stores and\r\nammunition. After a troublesome march, with some hard fighting, the\r\nexpedition reached Kingsville April 10. On the 9th companies B and D\r\nof the 56th had gallantly charged a rebel battery, in the face of a\r\nfusillade, and captured it, but with a loss in killed and wounded of\r\nfifteen men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G. W. Kern]\r\n\r\nThe next day news was received of the fall of Petersburgh and the\r\nsurrender of General Lee's army. In General Potter's order announcing\r\nit he returned \"special thanks to Lieutenant-Colonel Carmichael of\r\nthe 157th New York and detachment of the 56th New York for the\r\nskillful and gallant manner in which they carried the enemy's battery\r\nand drove him in confusion from the field.\"\r\n\r\nThe locomotives and cars at Kingsville were destroyed, and the\r\nexpedition marched back happy to their old camp at Mt. Pleasant. The\r\nfightings and severe hardships were ended at last.\r\n\r\nApril 14 the men witnessed the raising of the Union flag at Fort\r\nSumter on the 4th anniversary of its surrender. Soon the regiment was\r\nunited again at Summerville, and remained near there until the men\r\nwere paid up. It started homeward October 6th, and was disbanded and\r\nmustered out on Hart's Island, New York Harbor, November 10th, but a\r\nnumber of the men whose terms had expired had been discharged on July\r\n5th.\r\n\r\nDuring its last campaign in South Carolina the distances the regiment\r\nhad traversed were about as follows: Beaufort to Morris Island,\r\nseventy miles; to Coosawatchie by way of Honey Hill and Deveaux Neck,\r\nninety miles; to Charleston, seventy miles; to Santee River and\r\nreturn, eighty miles; Kingsville raid, 390 miles; to Newberry by way\r\nof Orangeburg and Columbia, 166 miles; to Chester, forty-five miles;\r\nto Charleston by way of Winsboro, Columbia and Florence, 205\r\nmiles--all during the regiment's last year of service.\r\n\r\nThe regiment arrived in New York City October 20, 1865, was quartered\r\nin the Battery barracks until November 9, was paid up and discharged\r\nNovember 10.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last there were 2,176 men and boys enlisted and\r\nassigned to the 56th regiment.\r\n\r\nThe incomplete record shows the names of forty-one killed in battle,\r\ntwenty-three died of wounds; 216 died of disease; 170 wounded and\r\nrecovered; 415 discharged for disability and wounds; sixty-seven\r\ntransferred to other commands; five captured and paroled.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a list of the engagements in which the regiment took\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     Engagements of the Fifty-sixth.\r\n\r\n  1.

V. is condensed from the history of the regiment\r\nprepared by Colonel Charles H. Weygant and published in 1877.\r\n\r\nThe 124th was distinctively an Orange County regiment, as all its\r\ncompanies were recruited in the county under President Lincoln's call\r\nof July 1, 1862, for 300,000 three years' men. The day after this\r\ncall was issued Governor Morgan made an appeal to the people of New\r\nYork urging them to respond promptly to the President's wish and the\r\ncountry's needs. The State was immediately divided into military\r\ndistricts and a committee of prominent citizens was appointed for\r\neach, to superintend the work of enlistment and recommend suitable\r\npersons for the officers of the regiments to be raised. Orange and\r\nSullivan Counties constituted one of these districts, and its\r\nmilitary committee was composed as follows:\r\n\r\nHon. Robert Denniston, Blooming Grove; Hon. Andrew S. Murray, Goshen;\r\nHugh S. Bull, Montgomery; Albert Post, Newburgh; James M. Barrett,\r\nCornwall; Alexander Moore, Washingtonville; Morgan Shint, Monroe.\r\n\r\nA little later the following were added to the committee: E. A.\r\nBrewster and William Fullerton, Newburgh; C. H. Winfield, Thomas\r\nEdsall and Silas Horton, Goshen; James Cromwell and William Avery,\r\nCornwall; C. C. McQuoid, Halstead Sweet, John G. Walkin and John\r\nCummings, Wallkill; Charles J. St. John, John Conkling, Orville J.\r\nBrown and C. M. Lawrence, Port Jervis; C. B. Newkirk, Monroe; A. S.\r\nDodge, Mount Hope; Dorastus Brown, Greenville; A. F. Schofield,\r\nMontgomery; A. G. Owen, Blooming Grove; John Cowdrey and Thomas\r\nWelling, Warwick.\r\n\r\nThe committee recommended A. Van Home Ellis, of New Windsor, then a\r\ncaptain in the service, for colonel of the regiment which it was\r\nproposed to raise in Orange, and to have general charge of the\r\nrecruiting. The gloomy conditions at the seat of war made enlistments\r\nslow throughout the State. Colonel Ellis, after his selection by the\r\ncommittee at its first meeting on June 11th, had gone to work\r\nimmediately, and opened recruiting offices in every town, yet only\r\neight men in all were enlisted in the county during the month. Then,\r\nwhen it was seen that the national capital was again in danger of\r\ncapture, public meetings were held, private bounties were offered,\r\nmoney for the support of the families of volunteers were raised, and\r\nthere was a general revival of patriotic enthusiasm. Although up to\r\nAugust 8th not more than a score of volunteers had reported at\r\nColonel Ellis's headquarters, fifteen days later the regiment was\r\nfully organized and ready to march to the front.\r\n\r\nThe regimental officers then were: A. Van Horne Ellis, colonel; F.\r\nM. Cummins, lieutenant colonel; James Cromwell, major; John H.\r\nThompson, surgeon; T. Scott Bradner, chaplain; Augustus Denniston,\r\nquartermaster; De Peyster Arden, adjutant; Edward Marshall,\r\nassistant surgeon; R. V. K. Montfort, 2nd assistant surgeon.\r\n\r\nThese field officers had all served honorably in the Union army, and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Cummins had been a commissioned officer in the\r\nMexican War.\r\n\r\nThe members of the regiment's band were: Drum Major, ____ Hart;\r\nbuglers, Wm. B. Wood, Moses P. Ross; fifes, John G. Buckley, Charles\r\nWhitehead, Arthur Haigh, Geo. W. Dimick, Henry C. Payne; drums,\r\nRobert L. Travis, A. J. Millspaugh, Geo. W. Canfield, John N. Cole,\r\nR. D. Stephens, Charles W. Bodle, Henry U. Cannon, Wm. Hamilton,\r\nHenry Hoofman, C. Van Gordon, Jehue Price, J. M. Merritt, W.\r\nJohnston, James McElroy, Samuel W. Weeden.\r\n\r\nThe captains of the several companies were: A. Charles H. Weygant;\r\nB. Henry S. Murray: C. Wm. Silliman; D. James W. Benedict: E. Wm. A.\r\nMcBirney; F. Ira S. Bush; G. Isaac Nicoll; H. David Crist; I. Leander\r\nClark; K. Wm. A. Jackson.\r\n\r\nDelay in obtaining guns postponed the mustering in of the regiment\r\nuntil September 5th, and the next day it broke camp at Goshen and\r\nstarted for Washington. Meanwhile it had been presented by Charles H.\r\nWinfield, in behalf of the ladies of Orange, with a stand of colors.\r\nIts fine appearance in New York inspired a paragraph of praise from\r\nthe Tribune, which said that the most influential families of Orange\r\nCounty were represented in its ranks, and that it contained \"the very\r\ncream of the regimental district.\"\r\n\r\nThree days afterward they were in Washington, and the first night\r\nthere slept on the ground and stone block in front of the Capitol.\r\nThe next day they marched to Camp Chase on Arlington Heights, and two\r\nor three days later moved to a spot which they christened Camp Ellis.\r\nHere they were attached to Platt's brigade of Whipple's division of\r\nHeintzleman's corps. The other regiments in the brigade were the\r\n122nd Pa. (a nine months regiment), the 86th N. Y., and the 1st Ohio\r\nbattery. The 124th and 86th regiments remained together during the\r\nwar. The latter and the Ohio battery were already veterans.\r\n\r\nThe 124th broke camp again September 25th, went to Miners' Hill, and\r\nhere the men became experienced in picket duties. Tents were struck\r\nOctober 16th, and the next day they started in a drizzling rain with\r\ntheir division to join the main army on the Maryland side of the\r\nPotomac in the vicinity of Harper's Ferry. A freight train carried\r\nthem in great discomfort from Washington to Knoxville, eight miles\r\nfrom Harper's Ferry, and they became a part of the Army of the\r\nPotomac. October 25th they again received marching orders, and were\r\nin motion from supper time till midnight, when they bivouacked near\r\nBerlin, where a pontoon bridge was being laid. Across this they went\r\nwith the entire army of 100,000 men, and were afterward halted in a\r\nmuddy cornfield near Lovettsville, where they had to stay all night\r\nin rain, a cold wind and mud, and had their first realization of the\r\nsufferings of army life. The next morning thirty of the men were\r\nunfit for duty. Short marches were continued, with stops of two or\r\nthree days, they being in the advance with the rest of Whipple\r\ndivision a part of the time, and then they looked from a peak of the\r\nBlue Ridge upon some white tents of the enemy. The object of the\r\nmovement had been to cut off a force of his infantry, but it was too\r\nlate and the division was ordered to retrace its steps.\r\n\r\nAt Orleans they learned that McClellan had been succeeded by\r\nBurnside as commander of the Army of the Potomac. November 11th they\r\nmarched to Waterloo, and here some of the men of Co. B, commanded by\r\nLieutenant W. E. Weygant, were part of a detail which had a fight\r\nwith the enemy's pickets and captured two prisoners. November 16th\r\nthey marched to Warrenton and here became a part of General Hooker's\r\ngrand division. There were now daily marches, some of the time\r\nthrough heavy rains and in deep mud. November 23rd, four miles from\r\nFredericksburg, they went into camp for the first time since leaving\r\nMiner's Hill. The army waited in that vicinity for the pontoon\r\ntrains, which did not arrive until December 10. Then, in pushing a\r\npontoon bridge across the Rappahannock, many of the builders were\r\nkilled by Mississippi sharpshooters. To stop this 120 cannon were\r\nplaced on Stafford Heights overlooking Fredericksburg, and began\r\nfiring shells into the city and among the sharpshooters. When the\r\nfiring ceased two bridges spanned the river, and Union troops hurried\r\nacross and soon drove the enemy out of Fredericksburg. But the great\r\nbattle was yet to come, when the Confederates forced Burnside's army\r\nto withdraw to Falmouth after losing 13,000 men. Platt's brigade\r\nformed the extreme right of the line, and the 124th was one of the\r\nlast regiments to recross the bridges. The next morning about half of\r\nthe men answered to the surgeon's call, and nearly a hundred were\r\nplaced on the sick list. General Platt resigned about Christmas time,\r\nand there was a period of drilling and picket duty by brigades.\r\nJanuary 5th the corps was reviewed by General Burnside. January 10th\r\nnew Enfield rifles came and were substituted for the old Belgians.\r\nThen, after three or four orders to march had been countermanded, a\r\nstart was made through pelting rain and sleet and deepening mud. The\r\nrain and sleet froze as it fell, and the men were chilled, and\r\nexperienced two nights of great suffering. General Burnside abandoned\r\nthe attempt to advance. On January 26th General Hooker superseded\r\nhim. The division moved a little way, and cut down trees and\r\nconstructed log cabins. During February the weather was severe, but\r\nthe log cabins, which had fire places, though smoky at times, made\r\nthem tolerably comfortable. February 25th the 124th drove off a body\r\nof Confederate cavalry which made a dash on their picket line. There\r\nwas a monotonous interval, enlivened April 7th by a grand review\r\nbefore President Lincoln and Generals Hooker and Sickles. The\r\ndivision and brigade were then attached to General Sickles's corps.\r\nOrders to march came April 28th, and the entire army was soon in\r\nmotion, and the next day halted in sight of the enemy's pickets\r\nacross the Rappahannock. The 124th crossed the river on a pontoon\r\nbridge with an army of 65,000 men, thirteen miles from Fredericksburg.\r\nThen came the disastrous battle of Chancellorsville, during which the\r\n124th got into the thickest of the fight, had a fierce encounter with\r\nIverson's brigade, and \"not a man faltered,\" although raked by a\r\ndeadly fire in which many men and a number of officers fell. Once they\r\nmade a charge and retook works from which one of our batteries had\r\nbeen driven. The battle ended with the day, and Hooker was whipped.\r\nThe Third corps lost in killed and wounded 4,000 men. It captured\r\nseven battle flags and over 1,000 prisoners. The losses of the 124th\r\nwere fifty-five killed, 150 wounded and six missing. Colonel Ellis, in\r\nhis official report said: \"Our men fought like tigers, cheering\r\nloudly, but falling fast, the officers without exception standing up\r\nto their duty and encouraging their commands.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Chancellorsville the 122nd Pa., having completed its nine\r\nmonths of service, returned home, and the brigade collapsed to\r\nbetween 500 and 600 men of the 86th and 124th. Colonel Ellis was now\r\nin command of the brigade, and it was selected as one of three\r\nbrigades of picked regiments to accompany a large body of cavalry on\r\na secret expedition. They Started May 6th through a thunderstorm to\r\nBeverly's Ford, where they crossed the Rappahannock. There had been a\r\nclash of cavalry, and Colonel Ellis's regiments were the first in the\r\nfield. Batteries on both sides opened fire, and there were charges\r\nand counter charges, in which bullets flew thick. A body of rebels got\r\nin the rear of the 124th, but they were repulsed after a hot contest\r\nin which Co.'s A, F and D lost two killed and twenty wounded. The\r\ntroops were ordered to recross the river.\r\n\r\nThe 124th did such splendid service at Chancellorsville that it was\r\ntransferred to the roll of \"first class, tried and to be trusted,\r\nveteran battalions,\" although only six weeks before it had been\r\nclassed among the \"untried recruits.\" June 9th it was part of an\r\nexpedition of these veteran regiments which recrossed the\r\nRappahannock, did some more fighting, under General Buford, and\r\ncaptured some of the enemy's pickets. General Pleasanton accompanied\r\nGeneral Buford and ordered an advance in force, but he found the\r\nenemy reinforced and the troops were withdrawn after a loss of about\r\n800 on each side. The 124th and 86th were commended as \"reliable\r\nregiments\" in the day's doings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soldier's Memorial, Goshen]\r\n\r\nAbout this time the old Whipple division ceased to exist in\r\nconsequence of the losses at Chancellorsville and mustering-out of\r\nseveral regiments. Berdan's sharpshooters and the 124th and 86th\r\nwere assigned to General J. H. H. Ward's brigade of General D. B.\r\nBirney's division.\r\n\r\nOn June 14th they started on one of their longest and severest\r\nmarches northward, and on June 25th crossed the Potomac at Edward's\r\nFerry near Ball's Bluff. Just before it was ordered Milner Brown was\r\nassigned to the command of the regiment. They proceeded through\r\nFredericksburg to Emmetsburg, and here on June 30th the 124th had\r\nbut 264 rifles in line, so great had been the losses in battle and\r\nfrom disease. They were informed that General Hooker had been\r\nsucceeded by General Meade. The Confederates had invaded Pennsylvania\r\nand a great battle was anticipated. A forced march was made to\r\nGettysburg through such intense heat that many were prostrated, and\r\nwhen the regiment reached the high ground south of Gettysburg not\r\nmore than 100 men and five or six officers appeared in the regimental\r\nline, but the next morning it was 240 strong. It was placed in the\r\nright center of the brigade, and in that decisive battle of the war\r\ndistinguished itself by its steadiness and daring. For forty minutes\r\nWard's and De Trobriand's brigades of about 3,000 men held their\r\nground against Longstreet's entire corps. By a mere chance the whole\r\nregiment escaped capture. General Ward harangued its men on the\r\nbattlefield, and said the heroic resistance they had made \"was beyond\r\nanything he had ever dared to hope for.\" Its active part in the\r\ngreat three days' battle was finished on the second day, as it was\r\nnot called upon to participate in the fighting of the third day,\r\nwhich brought defeat to Lee's army. The 124th had lost thirty-three\r\nkilled, including Colonel Ellis, Major James Cromwell and Captain\r\nIsaac Nicoll, and fifty-nine wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel\r\nCummins. A number of the severely wounded remained in the hands of\r\nthe enemy several days. The regiment was now reduced to 150 men with\r\nmuskets and nine commissioned officers. Some had been sent to the\r\ncorps hospital. They were now temporarily commanded by Captain\r\nCharles A. Weygant of Co. A.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of Lee began, but he was too swift for Meade, and escaped\r\nacross the Potomac. After various movements on both sides of the\r\nPotomac, which was crossed July 17th, the 124th bivouacked at\r\nManassas Gap July 22nd, in sight of the place of its first skirmish.\r\nThen the regiment had 700 rank and file, a full field staff and\r\ntwenty-five line officers. Now, although about thirty convalescents\r\nhad returned, it had less than 200 men in all. The corps, commanded\r\nby Major General French had been strengthened since Gettysburg by\r\nabout 8,000 new troops. General Ward still commanded the division.\r\n\r\nThere were some undecisive {_sic_} movements and skirmishing in which the\r\n124th participated. Lieutenant Colonel Cummins, having recovered,\r\nreturned and took command of the regiment July 28th. It was soon\r\nestablished in camp near Sulphur Springs and remained there six\r\nweeks. September 10th, in consequence of the backward movement of\r\nLee's army, General Meade pushed a heavy cavalry force across the\r\nRapidan, and soon the entire army was transferred to the region\r\nbetween the Rapidan and Rappahannock. The 124th broke camp September\r\n15th, and next encamped near Culpepper. October 2nd Lieutenant\r\nColonel Cummins was given a leave of absence for five days, and left\r\nCaptain Weygant in command. There were some uncertain movements, one\r\nof which followed a retrograde movement of Lee, October 19th, but he\r\nwas found to be out of reach and General Meade gave up the pursuit\r\nuntil twenty miles of railroad could be re-built. Next came the fight\r\nat Kelly's Ford of November 7th, in which the 124th supported the\r\n10th Massachusetts Battery, and the Confederates were defeated.\r\nWard's division took possession of the ford and captured over 500\r\nprisoners. The Union loss was only about fifty. Sedgwick's right wing\r\nattacked works on the bank of the Rappahannock, carried them by\r\na brilliant _coup de main,_ and captured 1,500 prisoners, his loss\r\nbeing about 300. In the march next day toward Beverly Station, with\r\nWard's division in front, the 124th was deployed as flankers and was\r\nunder fire for some time. There was no more fighting until November\r\n27th, when the fight at Locust Grove took place, followed by that\r\nat Mine Run. The 124th took part in both, and lost one killed, eight\r\nwounded and three captured. December 1st Meade ordered a retrograde\r\nmovement, and the regiment settled down to a long stay at Brandy\r\nStation and Culpepper. March 17 General Birney sent an order to\r\nColonel Cummins stating that to equalize the brigades the 124th would\r\nbe transferred to the Third Brigade. This was so displeasing that\r\nfourteen officers of the regiment petitioned General Birney to allow\r\nthem to remain under Brigadier General Ward. Major General Birney\r\nreplied that \"the request of the officers of this gallant regiment\r\nwould be fully considered,\" and he would try to grant it. This was\r\ndone, and the 124th remained in Ward's Brigade. Meanwhile it had\r\nreceived considerable additions in volunteers from Orange County,\r\nalthough not half as many as had been mustered out and transferred to\r\nthe veteran reserve corps in consequence of physical disability.\r\n\r\nEarly in March U. S. Grant had been made Lieutenant General and\r\ninvested by the President with the chief command of all the armies\r\nof the United States. In the latter part of March and the month of\r\nApril he caused a radical reorganization of the Army of the Potomac,\r\nand the \"Old Third\" became a part of the Second Corps.\r\n\r\nAn advance was ordered May 3d, and that night Birney's division\r\nstruck tents and began its march. Two days afterward the memorable\r\nBattle of the Wilderness was begun. Ward's command in this battle\r\nconsisted of eight infantry regiments, including the 124th and the\r\nSecond U. S. Sharpshooters, constituting one of the largest brigades\r\nin the army. The leading officers of the 124th were now Colonel\r\nCummins, Lieutenant-Colonel Weygant and Acting Major H. S. Murray.\r\nThe brigade and regiment did their allotted share in the two-days'\r\nbattle, but the regiment was less exposed than at Chancellorsville\r\nand Gettysburg, and came out with a loss of three killed and\r\nfifty-seven wounded, Colonel Cummins being among the wounded.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Spottsylvania Court House came a week later. On the 9th\r\nthe 124th N. Y. and 20th Ind. Regiments were thrown out as\r\nskirmishers for General Birney's division as it marched forward.\r\nNear Po River a Confederate battery opened on them, but fired too\r\nhigh, and soon had to flee. In the battle the next day for a while\r\nthe 124th supported a battery on the extreme right of Hancock's line,\r\nand then marched with the division towards the left, where it was\r\nsoon engaged, and assisted in an unsuccessful charge on the rebel\r\nline. It was in General Hancock's famous charge of May 12th. Birney's\r\ndivision was in four lines, with Ward's Brigade in front, the 124th\r\ncomposing the right center of the first line, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nWeygant in command. When the clash came there were hand-to-hand\r\nencounters so fierce and desperate as to defy description. There was\r\nan \"unparalleled struggle of eighteen hours' duration.\" Hancock's men\r\ncaptured the enemy's works, and he finally abandoned his efforts to\r\nretake them. The 124th had been so actively engaged or under fire so\r\nmuch that the men writing home as late as May 18th spoke of the\r\nbattle as having been raging since May 4th. Its losses were fifteen\r\nkilled, fifty-two wounded and two captured. Colonel Weygant was one\r\nof the wounded. After the battle the regiment was so small that it\r\nwas found necessary to consolidate it into five and then into three\r\ncompanies, and the 124th and 86th acted together, first under\r\nLieutenant Colonel Lansing and then Major Stafford, both of the 86th.\r\nThis union lasted until they settled down in front of Petersburg.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of May 20th the movement of the army from\r\nSpottsylvania Court House began in earnest. The 124th was in various\r\nmovements, and on June 1st seven of its men on picket duty were\r\ncaptured. In the bloody battle of Cold Harbor, June 3d, Birney's\r\ncommand was in reserve, and the men of the 124th were lookers-on.\r\n\r\nOffensive operations were suspended for a time, and General Grant\r\ndecided to transfer his army to the James River. On the evening of\r\nJune 12th, after a march of fifty-five miles, Hancock's corps reached\r\nWilcox Landing and was transferred to waiting steamboats. On June\r\n15th the advance of the rest of the army was resumed, Birney's\r\ncommand leading the column down the Prince George Court House road\r\ntowards Petersburg. The brigade encamped in a grove of pines on City\r\nPoint. There were only about 100 men left in the 124th. Between May\r\n18th and June 22nd it lost three killed, twenty-four wounded and\r\neight captured. Every third day from the 4th to the 24th of July the\r\nremnant was on the picket line. There were no engagements, but some\r\nskirmishing.\r\n\r\nGeneral Birney had been assigned to the command of the Tenth Corps,\r\nand the veterans of the \"Old Third\" were consolidated into one\r\ndivision under General Mott, and General De Trobriand became\r\ncommander of the brigade, which included the 124th, now commanded by\r\nLieutenant Colonel Weygant. When offensive operations were resumed on\r\nthe last day of September, the regiment could muster sixteen officers\r\nand 230 fighting men, and two months later had been reinforced so\r\nthat it numbered nineteen officers and 362 enlisted men, a few of\r\nwhom were raw recruits. It had some active and hazardous work during\r\nthe fall, before the army settled down in winter quarters. October\r\n26 Hancock's command moved to the Weldon road, and the next day\r\nDe Trobriand's brigade marched with Mott's division to Hatcher's Run,\r\nwhere General Eagan was having a skirmish, and preparing to force the\r\npassage of the stream. This was done, and presently De Trobriand's\r\nbrigade was ordered to the front to relieve the brigade on the left\r\nof Eagan's line. In the afternoon the enemy advanced in force, and\r\nthere was some furious fighting, in which the 124th brought to a halt\r\na flanking force of dismounted cavalry with a battery of rifled guns\r\nand sent them into the edge of a neighboring wood. The battle\r\ncontinued, and a bullet struck Colonel Weygant in the side, so that\r\nhe had to leave the field. Finally the Confederates fled. This was\r\ncalled the Battle of Boydton road. Three of the 124th were killed,\r\nfourteen wounded and six captured including two of the wounded. The\r\nregiment also took part in the raid of a week, beginning November\r\n6th, to destroy the Weldon railroad, when its loss was only one\r\nkilled and one wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Richard Wisner]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter the Union lines tightened around Richmond, but\r\napart from preparations for the spring campaign not much was done on\r\neither side. In February however, De Trobriand's brigade was in a\r\nshort fight at Hatcher's Run, across which the Union line was\r\npermanently extended.\r\n\r\nConfederate leaders did not allow Grant to open the spring campaign,\r\nand on March 26th attacked his lines, east of Petersburg, but were\r\nrepulsed. The previous day the 124th was in an engagement with 500\r\nConfederates, and in a gallant charge captured six officers and 164\r\nmen. Private George W. Tompkins shot the Confederate Commander,\r\nColonel Troy, and carried off the battle flag of his regiment which\r\nhe bore. Not a man of the 124th was injured. Private Tompkins was\r\ngiven a medal of honor from the Secretary of War, the thanks of\r\nCongress and a brevet commission.\r\n\r\nThe storming of Petersburg began April 2nd with all the artillery.\r\nThat night the 124th and two other regiments were ordered to advance,\r\nand got into a fight in which several men were seriously wounded. The\r\nobject of this move was to delay the return of some of Lee's troops,\r\nand was successful. The grand assault on the Confederate lines was\r\nmade at the appointed time, and a part of De Trobriand's brigade led\r\nby the 124th moved at double-quick over one of the main roads leading\r\ninto Petersburg, the Confederates fleeing before them, but wheeling\r\nand firing as they ran. Lee was quick to see the inevitable result of\r\nthe assault, and ordered the evacuation of Richmond. During April 3d\r\nthe 124th, which had the advance of the Second Corps, marched twenty\r\nmiles, and gathered in 200 dismounted Confederate cavalrymen. On the\r\n6th it came up with Lee's rear guard, and in the fighting of the\r\nmarch along Sailor's Creek up to this date the regiment lost four\r\nkilled, seventeen wounded and one missing. The pursuit was resumed on\r\nthe 7th, and on the 9th came the great surrender of Lee to Grant,\r\nwhen our \"men shouted until they could shout no longer.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the momentous event at Appomattox the 124th encamped at\r\nBurkesville Junction. In the night the men were awakened and\r\nhorrified by the news that President Lincoln and Secretary Seward\r\nhad been assassinated. On May 1st Meade's army took up its line of\r\nmarch for Washington, and came in sight of it about the middle of\r\nMay. On June 5th, after participating in the grand review of the\r\nwhole Union army, the 124th received its last marching orders. It\r\nreached home June 13th, and received a wonderful welcome from\r\nassembled thousands at Newburgh.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh Daily Union published the truth when it said the next\r\nday that it \"had made as noble a record as any regiment in the\r\nfield.\" It praised Colonels Ellis, Cummins and Weygant, and said of\r\nthe regiment: \"Slowly they filed past; and now the people's\r\nenthusiasm burst out over all bounds. Our scanty police and watch\r\nforce were swallowed up and overwhelmed, and the eager multitudes\r\nseemed as if they would throw themselves upon the soldiers. On they\r\nmarched with steady and resistless step, their paces and uniforms\r\ntelling of the fearful scenes they had passed through. Their battle\r\nflag, as it was borne aloft, awakened intense emotion; hardly a\r\nstrip of its frayed and bullet-torn silk was left; yet it was more\r\nprecious to the men and to the people than if it were made of cloth\r\nof gold.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Taylor made the address of welcome, in which he said: \"You are\r\nthe life-guards of the nation, and we look upon you with something of\r\nthe same reverence which we feel toward the fathers of our country.\r\nAnd we cherish the memory of those who fought, bled and died, and of\r\nthose who survived the carnage of Fredericksburg, of Chancellorsville,\r\nof Beverly's Ford, of Gettysburg, of the Wilderness, of Spottsylvania,\r\nof Boydton Road, of Sailor's Creek and the many battlefields around\r\nRichmond.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the official record of the commissioned officers of\r\nthe 124th, in which the date of commission is followed by the date of\r\nrank:\r\n\r\n     _REGIMENTAL AND COMPANY OFFICERS._\r\n\r\n     Colonels.\r\n\r\nA.

Y., was recruited in Newburgh,\r\nmostly from Co. L, 19th Regiment, N. G. S. N. Y., between May 20 and\r\n31, 1861, by Captain A. Van Horne Ellis. Governor Morgan refused to\r\npermit the company to leave the State, and thereupon Captain Ellis\r\ntook it to New York on his own responsibility. It was furnished with\r\ntransportation to Washington, was accepted through the influence of\r\nSecretary Seward, and mustered in for three months. It was stationed\r\nat the Washington Navy Yard, sent to Chapel Point and Point Tobacco,\r\nJune 28, returned, and on July 16 was brigaded with Rhode Island and\r\nNew Hampshire regiments under Colonel Burnside. It went to the Bull\r\nRun battlefield dragging two twelve-pound boat howitzers on July 4th,\r\nand returned with them. Soon it went back, arriving on the Bull Run\r\nbattlefield July 21st, and in the battle fired 232 shots of shrapnel\r\nand canister. It drew out of the conflict by order at 3 P. M. with\r\nthe loss of one killed and two wounded, and returned to Washington.\r\nIt was soon back in Newburgh, where it was mustered out July 30th.\r\nThe officers during this service were:\r\n\r\nA.

Travis, second sergeant; John McMeekin, third sergeant;\r\nJames B. Montgomery, fourth sergeant; Thomas Riley, fifth sergeant;\r\nRobert Acheson, David M. De Witt, Wm. M. Verplanck and Edward J. Hall,\r\ncorporals.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ellis afterward became colonel of the 124th, and several\r\nother members of the company became captains and lieutenants in the\r\n124th, 56th and other regiments.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1862, the 19th regiment of militia, commanded by Colonel Wm.\r\nR. Brown, was ordered to Washington, and after recruiting its ranks,\r\nwhich had been depleted by volunteer enlistments, left Newburgh June\r\n4. Arriving in Baltimore, it was ordered to Stuart Hill, and remained\r\nthere until July 2nd, when two of its companies were ordered to Fort\r\nMcHenrv and the rest of the regiment to Fort Marshall. On July 14\r\nfour companies were ordered to Fort Delaware, and remained there\r\nuntil August 10th, when they were sent to Havre de Grace to guard the\r\nrailroad between there and Baltimore. The whole regiment went back to\r\nNewburgh the last of August, and was mustered out of the U. S.\r\nservice September 6.\r\n\r\nOfficers during this expedition were: William J. Brown, colonel;\r\nJames Low, lieutenant colonel; David Jagger, major; George Weller,\r\nquartermaster; William J. Hathaway, adjutant.\r\n\r\nIn August Colonel Brown twice offered the services of the regiment\r\nfor nine months, but the offers were refused by Governor Morgan. He\r\noffered them again September 17, when they were accepted. Recruiting\r\nfor it was complicated by the efforts of Colonel Isaac Wood to raise\r\nan authorized regiment of three years' men in the county at the same\r\ntime, but he stopped after enlisting 272 men, who were consolidated\r\nwith the 176th N. Y. V. and mustered in November 20th.\r\n\r\nColonel Brown continued to enroll volunteers until February 2nd, when\r\nhis regiment, known as the 168th, left Newburgh with 750 men, and\r\nNew York City eleven days later with 835 men. It went to Yorktown,\r\nand remained there on garrison duty during nearly its whole term of\r\nservice. Once a detachment of 140 men under Captain Daniel Torbush\r\nwas sent with detachments from other regiments up York and Mattapony\r\nRivers, and the Torbush detachment was placed to guard the Richmond\r\nroad. Here it was attacked by a force of Confederate cavalry, and\r\nrepulsed them, killing fourteen, and losing one killed, five wounded\r\nand two captured. September 16th the regiment was sent to Bridgeport,\r\nAla., and remained there on guard duty until October 14th, when it\r\nwent back to Newburgh, and was mustered out October 31st. During its\r\nnine months of service it lost one killed, eighteen died, thirteen\r\ncaptured and 184 deserters. Its commissioned officers were:\r\n\r\n Colonel: William R. Brown.\r\n Lieutenant-Colonels: James Low, James C. Rennison.\r\n Majors: George Waller (dismissed), James C. Rennison, Daniel\r\n   Torbush.\r\n Adjutant: Wm. R. Hathway.\r\n Quartermasters: James H. Anderson, George C. Spencer.\r\n Surgeon: Jacob M. Leighton.\r\n Assistant Surgeon: Edward B. Root.\r\n Chaplain: R. Howard Wallace.\r\n Captains: Wm. H. Terwilliger, Daniel Torbush, James H. Anderson,\r\n   Isaac Jenkinson, Bennett Gilbert, George McCleary, Samuel Hunter,\r\n   John D. Wood, James C. Rennison, Myron A. Tappan, Marshal Van\r\n   Zile.\r\n First Lieutenants: Nathan Hubbard, Oliver Taylor, Jacob K. R.\r\n   Oakley, Archibald Ferguson, James H. Searles, Lawrence Brennan,\r\n   James T. Chase, De Witt C. Wilkin, Wm. D. Dickey, Marshal Van\r\n   Tile, George R. Brainsted.\r\n Second Lieutenants: Thomas P. Terwilliger, Isaac N. Morehouse, James\r\n   H. Anderson, Geo. C. Marvin, Andrew J. Gilbert, Samuel C. Wilson,\r\n   Paul Terwilliger, Geo. W. Hennion, Daniel Low, Jr., Geo. R.\r\n   Brainsted, Bartley Brown, Lester Genung.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. N. Weed]\r\n\r\nThe 176th regiment, with which Colonel Wood's 272 recruits were\r\nconsolidated, was sent to the Department of the Gulf as a part of the\r\nNineteenth Corps, and was in the Red River campaign in 1864, in\r\nGeneral Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign the same year, and in\r\nGeorgia and North Carolina in the early months of 1865. In the Red\r\nRiver campaign it did some fighting and lost many men in killed,\r\nwounded and prisoners. Of its Orange County officers, T. Henry\r\nEdsall was adjutant, Sprague K. Wood rose from sergeant to captain,\r\nand Joseph Goodsell from second lieutenant to captain.\r\n\r\nThe company of cavalry recruited in the fall of 1861 by Morris I.\r\nMcCormal as a part of Colonel Van Wyck's \"Tenth Legion,\" when it was\r\ndetached from this regiment was mustered in as Co. C, First Mounted\r\nRifles, and had ninety-five men. The company served three years.\r\nOfficers were: Morris I. McCormal, captain; Charles F. Allen, first\r\nlieutenant; Arthur Hagen, second lieutenant; Ardice Robbins, orderly\r\nsergeant; C. R. Smith, quartermaster sergeant. Captain McCormal\r\nresigned in 1862, but re-entered the service in the Fifteenth\r\nCavalry in 1863. Quartermaster Smith and Sergeants James Eaton,\r\nFrank Mills and Fred Penney were promoted to lieutenants.\r\n\r\nOrange County was represented in the Seventh, afterward Second,\r\nregiment of Cavalry, its volunteers being mostly in Co. B, under\r\nCaptain Charles E. Morton of New Windsor. Alanson Randall, U. S. A.,\r\na native of Newburgh, was colonel of the regiment from November,\r\n1864, to the muster out, June 5, 1865. The regiment was also known as\r\nthe Harris Light Cavalry.\r\n\r\nRecruits were obtained in Orange County for the Fifteenth Cavalry in\r\nthe winter of 1863-4 by Captain Morris I. McCormal of Middletown, and\r\nLieutenant Charles H. Lyon of Newburgh.\r\n\r\nThe Fifteenth Heavy Artillery's Co. M was mostly recruited in Orange\r\nCounty in the winter of 1863-4. The regiment was mustered in at Fort\r\nLyon, Va., February 3, 1864, remained there until March 27th, when\r\nit went to Beverly Station and was assigned to duty in the Artillery\r\nReserve of the Army of the Potomac, and did creditable service in\r\nseveral bloody battles. When Co. M was organized its officers were:\r\nWm. D. Dickey of Newburgh, captain; Alfred Newbatt and Julius\r\nNiebergall, first lieutenants; John Ritchie and Robert B. Keeler,\r\nsecond lieutenants. August 15th Captain Dickey was placed in command\r\nof the Third Battalion and Lieutenant Ritchie took command of the\r\ncompany, leading it through the engagements in the struggle for the\r\nWeldon railroad, in one of which it lost in killed and wounded a\r\nthird of its men. For the regiment's good work here and in a\r\nprevious fight at Haines' Tavern it was complimented in the general\r\norders of Meade. Co. M was mustered out in July, 1865. It lost during\r\nits year of service three officers and ninety-five privates. The\r\npromotions were: Captain Dickey to major, Second Lieutenants Keeler\r\nand Ritchie to first lieutenants, and Sergeants Joseph M. Dickey and\r\nRiemann to second lieutenants.\r\n\r\nThis Seventeenth Independent Battery was recruited in Orange to be a\r\npart of Colonel Van Wyck's \"Tenth Legion\" or 56th Regiment. It\r\narrived in Washington November 11, 1861, and was organized as an\r\nindependent battery January 10, 1862. It was first assigned to\r\nCasey's, afterwards Peek's division. It also served in the Seventh\r\nCorps, then in the Second division of the Eighteenth Corps, at\r\nBermuda Hundred a short time in the Tenth Corps, and when mustered\r\nout formed a part of the artillery brigade of the Twenty-fourth\r\nCorps. It was in the siege of Yorktown, the battles of Williamsburg,\r\nSavage's Station, Fair Oaks, Malvern Hill, the siege of Suffolk, and\r\nwas in action at Petersburg, Dutch Gap, Fort Harrison, Hatcher's Run\r\nand Port Walthal. It was in the investment of Petersburg and\r\nRichmond. It suffered most severely at Fair Oaks. Its record was good\r\nthroughout. Its commissioned officers were:\r\n\r\n Captain: Peter C. Regan.\r\n First Lieutenants: Eugene Scheibner, Abram Kniffin, Martin V.\r\n   McIntyre, John S. Bennett.\r\n Second Lieutenants: Abram Kniffin, Charles S. Harvell, Abram Smith,\r\n   Wm. H. Lee, Edward Kelly, John B. Brosen, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe First Regiment of Engineers, known as Serrell's, had in its\r\nranks, it was said, 300 or 400 men from Orange County. Its\r\ndetachments were mustered in between September 10, 1861, and February\r\n12, 1862. The regiment retained its organization until June 30, 1865,\r\nwhen it was mustered out, but there were various changes in its\r\ncomposition. It was an important regiment in the engineering part of\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nCompany C of the 98th N. Y. S. V., was mostly recruited in Newburgh\r\nin the winter of 1863-4 by Captain James H. Anderson and Lieutenant\r\nJ. K. R. Oakley, who had been in the 168th Regiment. They went to\r\nRiker's Island in February, 1864, and here consolidation requirements\r\ncaused Co. C to consist of ninety-five Orange County men under\r\nCaptain Anderson and Lieutenants Oakley and Sneed, and twenty-four\r\nwere assigned to Co. I under Captain E. M. Allen. The record of the\r\nregiment was one of the best. It fought at Drury's Bluff, Cold Harbor\r\nand Petersburg. At Drury's Bluff it saved General Buller's army from\r\na flank attack: at Cold Harbor it lost in killed and wounded 100 men;\r\nat Petersburg it charged the outer line of the enemy's works and was\r\nalmost constantly under fire. Its colors were the first to be planted\r\nat Fort Harrison on September 29, 1864, and it was the first regiment\r\nto enter Richmond after the evacuation. After the surrender of Lee\r\nit was on post and garrison duty in several places, and was mustered\r\nout at Richmond August 31, 1865. Of the men who went out with Captain\r\nAnderson, thirteen were killed or died of wounds, twenty-three\r\nwounded, and five died of disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jas. D.

Sears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the older towns of Orange County, lying somewhat\r\nnorthwest of the geographical center. The towns of Hamptonburgh and\r\nNew Windsor are on the north, Cornwall on the east, Monroe and\r\nWoodbury on the south and Goshen and Chester on the west. It covers\r\nan area of 21,759 acres.\r\n\r\nThe title to all the territory of this town conveyed by the various\r\noriginal patents, upon which rests the deed of every property-holder\r\nto-day has been carefully preserved. The names and dates of the first\r\nsettlers are also pretty fully recorded.\r\n\r\nThe oldest grant of land seems to be the Mompesson Patent, which is\r\ndated March 4, 1709, and confirmed May 31, 1712. This covered 1,000\r\nacres. The next grant in order of time is that known as the Rip Van\r\nDam patent, which is dated March 23, 1907 {_sic_} and covered some\r\n3,000 acres. This was granted to Rip Van Dam, Adolph Phillips, David\r\nProvost, Jr., Lancaster Symes and Thomas Jones, each having an equal\r\nshare in the tract. This is described as \"beginning at a station\r\nbearing west 24 degrees north, and 85 chains from the wigwam of the\r\nIndian Maringamus,\" which was on the southwest bank of Murderer's\r\nCreek just across the railroad track from the Catholic Church of St.\r\nMary. The present village of Salisbury Mills is on the east end of\r\nthis patent so far as the village lies in the town. In the northeast\r\ncorner of the town on the old county line is the 1,000 acre tract of\r\nRoger Van Dam which is dated June 30, 1720, although a portion of\r\nthis tract extends over into the present town of New Windsor. The\r\nnext patent was granted to Ann Hoagland, May 24, 1723, and it\r\ncontained 2,000 acres in the western part of the town. In the\r\nsoutheastern part of the town, adjoining the Rip Van Dam patent, and\r\nwest of the Schunnemunk Mountains was the 2,000 acre grant of Edward\r\nBlagg and Johannes Hey, dated March 28, 1726. This valley has been\r\nknown ever since as Blagg's Clove. West of this was the irregular\r\ntract of 2,440 acres granted to Nathaniel Hazzard January 11, 1727.\r\nThis was south of Washingtonville. Still further west was the Joseph\r\nSackett 2,000-acre tract, to which 222 acres were afterward added on\r\nthe south. This patent was dated July 7, 1736, and the tract adjoins\r\nthe present village of Oxford. Sackett got another grant of 149 acres\r\nSeptember 1, 1737, on the west.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 1723 a patent covering 2,600 acres was granted to\r\nRichard Gerard and William Bull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Benjamin C. Sears.]\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe surface of this town is varied by the long range of Schunnemunk\r\nMountains, forming the eastern boundary, with its level ridges\r\nreaching to the height of about 1,600 feet, and the beautiful\r\nfoothills of Woodcock, Round Hill, Mosquito, Raynor and Peddler. The\r\nlast two have deposits of magnetic iron ore, which mixed with the\r\nores from other parts of the county was used in making the Parott\r\nguns during the War of the Rebellion. The cultivated land is also\r\nbroken and rolling, some upon quite high hills, whose sides were not\r\ncultivated, and are covered with luxuriant blue grass pastures, and\r\nalong the streams and the lower lands are beautiful natural meadows,\r\nwhich bring their annual tribute of hay into the barns, and add very\r\nmuch to the beauty of the scenery.\r\n\r\nThe Greycourt or Cromeline Creek runs from Walton Lake by the base of\r\nGoose Pond Mountain, through the Greycourt meadows and the\r\npicturesque falls at Craigville, through Farmingdale and Hulsetown,\r\nand is joined near the Hamptonburgh line by the Otterkill; near\r\nWashingtonville by the Tappan or Schunnemunk Creek, flowing from\r\nSattterly's Mills; also by the Silver stream draining a portion of\r\nBlagg's Clove, and furnishing at the old Coleman Mills, the excellent\r\nwater supply of Washingtonville. The united stream is called\r\nMurdner's or Murderer's Creek, to which N. P. Willis gave the more\r\npoetical name of \"Moodna,\" where it entered the Hudson near Idlewild.\r\nThese streams have along their bank beautiful natural meadows dotted\r\nwith fine old trees, and the hill-tops are covered in places with\r\nsugar maple and chestnut trees, making in the early spring time a\r\nbeautiful picture of varied green, and in the autumn a glorious\r\nvariety of colors, which, together with the fine apple orchards\r\ncrowning the hillsides, justifies the name of Blooming Grove.\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLERS.\r\n\r\nVincent Mathews seems to have been the first settler according to the\r\nrecord. He bought the Rip Van Dam Patent, August 22, 1721, and built\r\na grist mill at the place since known as Salisbury. He named this\r\nestate \"Mathewsfield.\" Thomas Goldsmith came next, about ten years\r\nlater, and he took the Mompesson Patent. He built a house on the\r\nnorth bank of the Otterkill, now known as the \"Walnut Grove Farm,\"\r\nnear the present Washingtonville. Edward Blagg also settled upon\r\nthis tract, known as \"Blagg's Clove\" about this time. Mathews sold\r\nhis mill to John J. Carpenter, which was turned into a powder mill\r\nunder a State contract in 1776, when under the kindling fires of\r\npatriotism the demand for powder became very active.\r\n\r\nIn 1753 Jesse Woodhull settled in Blagg's Clove, although he seems to\r\nhave purchased the Richard Van Dam Patent upon which the Moffatt\r\nfamily afterward settled. Mr. Mathews, the original settler, was an\r\nattorney, and took an active part in the early history of the town.\r\nHe sold 1,500 of his acres to Louis Du Bois, of New Paltz, who built\r\na tavern upon it which was kept by Zachariah Du Bois in Revolutionary\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1764 the territory of this town was a part of the Goshen\r\nprecinct. From that time to 1799 it formed a part of the town of\r\nCornwall. The other prominent settlers of the town are believed to be\r\nincluded in the following list:\r\n\r\nJohn Brewster, Edward, Francis, Isaac, Jesse and Nathan Brewster,\r\nDaniel Brewster, George Duryea, Richard Goldsmith, Benjamin Gregory,\r\nJohn Hudson, Henry Hudson, William Hudson, Archibald Little, Timothy,\r\nJames and Solomon Little; James Mapes, and his sons Wines, Jesse,\r\nRobert, James, Barney, David, William and Thomas; Elihu Marvin, a\r\nmember of the Committee of Safety in 1775, also judge of the county\r\nin 1778; Seth, Nathan, James, Jesse and John Marvin; Samuel Moffatt;\r\nJames and Fletcher Mathews, sons of Vincent Mathews, who was a\r\ncolonel in the Revolution and a leading citizen; Thomas Moffatt,\r\nmember of the Committee of Safety from 1778 to 1794; Josiah, Samuel,\r\nJacob, Stephen and Peter Reeder; Israel, Thaddeus, John, Jesse,\r\nJosiah and Samuel Seely; Bezaliel Seeley; Selah Strong, the first\r\nsupervisor of the town; Major Samuel and Captain Nathan Strong;\r\nNathaniel Satterly, member of Committee of Safety in 1775, and\r\nproprietor of Satterly's Mills in 1765; John and Selah Satterly;\r\nJames, Nathaniel and John Sayer; Nathaniel Strong, member of\r\nCommittee of Safety, who was shot at his door by Claudius Smith,\r\nOctober 6, 1778; Captain Jesse Woodhull, delegate to the first\r\nProvincial Convention, and member of the State Convention that\r\nrevised the federal constitution in 1778; Abner Woodhull, George and\r\nBenjamin Whittaker; Silas, Reuben and Birdseye Young; Stephen\r\nMathews, Gilbert, Zachariah and John Du Bois; Hezekiah, Isaiah,\r\nStephen, Isaac, Paul, Zepheniah, Charles, Aaron, Silas and Jeremiah\r\nHowell; Benjamin and Thomas Goldsmith; David Coleman, Caleb, Joab,\r\nAsahel, Micah, Silas, Richard and Jeremiah Coleman; Thomas, John,\r\nFrancis and Richard Drake; Nathaniel Coleman; Daniel Curtis; John\r\nChandler; Henry and Oliver Davenport.\r\n\r\nAmong other family names recorded are those of Carpenter, Moffatt,\r\nOwens, Gregg and Wooley. It is said of the Woodhull family that its\r\nancestry is distinctly traced to the individual who came to England\r\nfrom Normandy with William the Conqueror in 1066.\r\n\r\nCIVIL ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe town of Blooming Grove was organized March 23, 1799, the\r\nterritory being taken from the more ancient Cornwall township. The\r\nname Blooming Grove had long been in use for this part of Cornwall,\r\nbeing the name of the old village which was given to distinguish it\r\nfrom Hunting Grove, a locality then in New Windsor.\r\n\r\nThe first town meeting was held at the house of John Chandler, the\r\nfirst Tuesday of April, 1799. Selah Strong was then elected\r\nsupervisor and Daniel Brewster town clerk. Two hundred dollars were\r\nraised for the support of the poor that year, and a $10 bounty was\r\nvoted for each wolf killed within the town. Mr. Brewster served as\r\ntown clerk for thirty-seven years without intermission. There was\r\nlittle personal politics in those times, and public office was\r\nprobably regarded as a public trust.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1830, a part of the town was taken off in the formation of\r\nHamptonburgh. In March, 1845, another small portion was set off to\r\nthe town of Chester.\r\n\r\nCharles W. Hull has been town clerk since 1874, and has just been\r\nreelected, so that his term will be nearly as long as John\r\nBrewster's.\r\n\r\nThe house of John Brewster, at which the town meetings were held,\r\n1765 to 1799, was kept as a hotel and was said to be the homestead of\r\nthe Cooper family, upon which is now situated the Blooming Grove\r\nstation and post-office.\r\n\r\nWhen the present town of Blooming Grove was formed, the principal\r\ncenter was at Blooming Grove, where the old church was erected, 1759.\r\nThe first town meeting was held in the spring of 1759, at the house\r\nof John Chandler, who kept a general country store here several years\r\nprevious to this, also at Edenville, near Warwick, taking in wheat\r\nand other grain which was carted to New Windsor, ground at the old\r\nmill on Quassaic Creek, and shipped to the West Indies and exchanged\r\nfor sugar, molasses and other products of the tropics, which were\r\nbrought back to Orange County by the Hudson River to New Windsor,\r\nand exchanged again for grain and other farm products. John Chandler\r\npurchased in 1793 a small farm, upon which his great-grandson, B. C.\r\nSears, now resides. He was president of the Newburgh and New Windsor\r\nTurnpike Co., and of the Blooming Grove and Greycourt Turnpike Co.,\r\nbuilt by his son-in-law, Hector Craig. He was an elder in the\r\nBlooming Grove Church and a large land owner in this part of the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe village of Blooming Grove then consisted of the old church and\r\nthe old Blooming Grove academy, built about 1810, to which many of\r\nthe students came from the neighboring towns, boarding with the\r\nneighbors about. A part of it was used as a district school until\r\n1857, when the present building was built upon the old academy site.\r\nA blacksmith-shop, kept later by Pierson Genung, a drug store, a\r\ncooper shop, the old toll-gate, the country store, and the hotel kept\r\nby Benjamin Thompson, where were held the town meetings, general\r\ntrainings, etc., and the public were entertained, were on this the\r\nmain thoroughfare from Warwick to New Windsor and later Newburgh.\r\nThis property was conveyed to Samuel Moffatt, Jr., merchant, by the\r\nexecutors of Rev. Benoni Bradner, and by him to Seth Marvin in 1810,\r\nwho built a store-house on a lot purchased of Charles Howell, 1810.\r\nBlooming Grove now consists only of the old church, the parsonage and\r\nthe schoolhouse, and half a mile away the station, store and\r\npost-office, kept by C. C. Gerow, and the creamery owned by the\r\nSheffield, Slawson, Decker Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles R. Bull.]\r\n\r\nVARIOUS RESIDENTS\r\n\r\nIn 1810, Samuel Moffatt, Jr., having sold his place in Blooming\r\nGrove, moved to a new settlement at Washingtonville, building the old\r\ncorner store, now owned by George A. Owen. Across the highway Moses\r\nEly, the father of the late Dr. Ely, of Newburgh, had a tannery, and\r\nJohn Jaques, then a young man, opened here a shoe-shop. The old\r\ncorner store, built in the woods almost, there being only two other\r\ndwellings, (a log house owned by James Giles and the private school\r\nof Jane Sweezey), was carried on by Samuel Moffatt and his son David,\r\neither alone or as members of the firm, from 1812 to 1832; then John\r\nS. Bull, 1832-1839; Walter Halsey and Apollis Halsey, 1839-1850; and\r\nthe Warners and Williams Howell, 1850 to 1890, and George A. Owen,\r\n1890, to this date. This store has always been, and is still, a\r\nprominent landmark in Washingtonville. In 1813, Jedediah Breed came\r\nto Washingtonville from Dutchess County, and built a harness shop\r\nadjoining the dwelling house now owned by his grandson, George A.\r\nOwen, and which has been occupied as a harness shop for nearly 100\r\nyears. Here Henry F. Breed kept the Blooming Grove post-office for\r\nforty years, nearly continuously; after his death the post-office was\r\nremoved to the building of Alexander Moore, where, in 1872, the name\r\nwas changed from Blooming Grove to Washingtonville.\r\n\r\nAlexander Moore and his brother-in-law, Albert G. Owen, the father of\r\nGeorge A. Owen, carried on a furniture and paint business here from\r\n1830 to 1850, Moore being the postmaster and Owen, supervisor and\r\njustice for many years, and a member of the Assembly, 1849-1850. This\r\nvillage soon grew to be important, and is now one of the finest\r\nvillages of its size in Orange County, having a beautiful shaded\r\navenue of maples and many handsome residences. There are the\r\nPresbyterian and Methodist churches, Catholic Church of St. Mary, and\r\nthe beautiful Moffatt Library, given to the village by David H.\r\nMoffatt, of Denver, and erected under the careful supervision of\r\nJohn Newton Moffatt, having a fine collection of books and a\r\nbeautiful hall which is the convenient center for much social\r\nenjoyment; the large feed mill, originally built by David H. Moffatt,\r\nthe father of David H., and now carried on by the Thomas Fulton Co.,\r\ntogether with a large coal and lumber business; a similar\r\nestablishment carried on by Hector Moffatt & Son, and the very large\r\nwine vaults of the Brotherhood Wine Co., successors to the James\r\nbrothers' vineyard established in 1838. The Bordens also have here a\r\nlarge creamery, and there is also the Farmers' Creamery, now operated\r\nby the Mutual Milk and Cream Co., making this the most important\r\nstation upon the Newburgh Branch of the Erie Railroad. It is\r\nsurrounded by beautiful homes and thrifty farms. Within the\r\ncorporation line are the home and farm of William H. Hallock, who\r\nowns several of the old ancestral homes throughout the town, which he\r\nhas improved, and still runs with great business ability; also the\r\nancestral homes of the Brooks family, descendants of Fletcher\r\nMathews, one of the original settlers, and also the old Nicoll\r\nhomestead, now occupied by Charles Nicoll.\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Washingtonville is the old Joseph Moffatt homestead, now\r\nheld by his grandsons, C. R. Shons and S. L. Moffatt, who have\r\nbeautiful orchards, which, with that of Jesse Hulse, crown the\r\nbeautiful hilltop and have made \"Blooming Grove apples\" famous both\r\nat home and abroad; also the Walnut Grove farm, upon which the first\r\nGoldsmiths settled, and made famous by Alden Goldsmith and his sons,\r\nJames and John A., now in the hands of the widow of John A. and her\r\nhusband, Mr. O. B. Stillman; also the home of the late Captain Thomas\r\nN. Hulse, so long and so favorably known years ago to all travelers\r\nupon the Hudson River, now the home of his niece, Mrs. James A.\r\nKnapp, daughter of Benjamin Moffatt. Two and a half miles east of the\r\nvillage of Washingtonville is the village of Salisbury Mills, the\r\noldest settlement of the town, where, on the falls of Murderer's\r\nCreek, Vincent Mathews built his mill, which later was owned by\r\nCaptain Richard Caldwell, by Peter Van Allen, by Isaac Oakly, and is\r\nnow the Arlington paper mills, owned and operated on a very large\r\nscale by Henry Ramsdell. Here in 1803 came John Caldwell, and with\r\nhim his three sons, John, Andrew J. and Richard. Richard, then a\r\nmere lad, had been at the head of a company in the Emmet Rebellion,\r\nand through the clemency of Lord Cornwallis his sentence of death was\r\ncommuted to banishment for himself and his father's family. He came\r\nto Salisbury with his father, and in 1808 married a daughter of John\r\nChandler. He had the mill and a store at Salisbury. When the war with\r\nEngland in 1812 became a certainty, Richard Caldwell raised the 25th\r\nCo. Infantry of soldiers, was elected their captain, and led them\r\ntoward Canada, crossing Lake Champlain in open boats, in a severe\r\nstorm. He divided his extra clothing with his soldiers, and\r\ncontracted a severe cold, resulting in pneumonia, and he died\r\nDecember 11, 1812, and is buried at Champlain, near Plattsburgh. His\r\nname is perpetuated by the beautiful monument erected in Salisbury\r\nMills by his nephew, Richard Caldwell, to his memory and the memory\r\nof those who perished with him in that ill-advised and ill-equipped\r\nexpedition; also to the memory of Captain Isaac Nicoll and those who\r\ndied with him, in the War of the Rebellion. Captain Richard Caldwell\r\nleft two children, John R. Caldwell, long well known as a prominent\r\ncitizen of New Windsor, and Mary, the wife of Marcus Sears, M.D. The\r\nold house erected by John Caldwell in 1803 is still standing, long\r\nknown as the home of Andrew J. Caldwell and his son, Richard\r\nCaldwell, both of whom stood firm for righteousness and temperance.\r\nIn a part of the same grounds was the home of a sister, Mrs.\r\nChambers, now occupied by the widow of Richard Caldwell, and from\r\nwhich still emanates a powerful influence for good to the whole\r\nvillage. Also the old home of the oldest son, John Caldwell, who was\r\na merchant in New York, and on retiring came to live with his kindred\r\nin Salisbury, was the first president of the Orange County\r\nAgricultural Society, and was much interested in keeping silk worms\r\nand actually produced silk from the mulberry trees growing on his\r\ngrounds in Salisbury.\r\n\r\nNear the village stands a part of the old stone house, the home of\r\nMajor Du Bois, who was a prominent man in the War of the Revolution,\r\nas major in Colonel Woodhull's regiment, who was a prisoner for ten\r\nmonths in the hands of the British, and who lost his extensive lands\r\nby the depreciation of the Colonial money and his enforced absence\r\nfrom home; also the beautiful home of the family of Hon. Robert\r\nDenniston. The ancestor of the Denniston family was Alexander\r\nDenniston, the brother-in-law of Charles Clinton, who with many of\r\nhis friends and neighbors, all being Scotch Presbyterians, and tired\r\nof the exactions and demands of the crown, emigrated from the town of\r\nEdgeworth, county of Longford, Ireland, in the early summer of 1729.\r\nAfter a long, tedious voyage of nearly five months, they landed on\r\nCape Cod; thence two years later they came to Little Britain. A\r\nfamily legend is, that these pioneers stood upon a hilltop about two\r\nmiles northeast of Washingtonville and called the land in sight to\r\nthe north, Little Britain, and there they settled. Alexander had six\r\nsons, James, George, Alexander, William, John, Charles, and four\r\ndaughters. They were all stern patriots devoted to their country. The\r\nfather was a member of Colonel Ellison's New Windsor regiment in\r\n1738, and on frontier service in 1755. The six sons were all members\r\nof the Third Ulster County regiment, which was called out many times\r\nduring the dark days of the Revolution. Two were members of the\r\nCommittee of Safety and one served in the line during the whole war.\r\nOf these sons James was the only one that settled in the town of\r\nBlooming Grove, the others settling elsewhere, New Windsor, Cornwall,\r\netc. He purchased, in 1790, the farm one mile east of Washingtonville,\r\nwhich still remains in the family. He had three sons, James,\r\nAlexander, Abraham, and two daughters. He died in 1805, leaving the\r\nhomestead to his son James. The latter had one son, Robert, and four\r\ndaughters. Dying in 1825, the homestead was inherited by his son\r\nRobert. The latter served as an officer of the militia, was justice of\r\nthe peace in his native town, judge of the Court of Common Pleas in\r\nOrange County, was elected member of the New York State Assembly in\r\n1835, and again in 1839 and 1840, and was State senator from 1841-1847\r\nand State comptroller in 1860 and 1861. He was very active and\r\nenergetic in his endeavors to maintain the Union during the War of the\r\nRebellion, and was chairman of the military commission in the Orange\r\nand Sullivan Counties district. He had five sons, William Scott, James\r\nOtis, Robert, Henry Martyn, Augustus, and six daughters. These sons,\r\nlike their ancestors, were all interested in the war for the\r\npreservation of the Union, and served either in the army or navy.\r\nWilliam Scott was a surgeon in the volunteer army and died of fever,\r\nJuly, 1862. James Otis was first lieutenant and captain, Company G,\r\n124th N. Y. State Volunteers, July 2, 1862, to September 3, 1863,\r\nwhen, on account of wounds, he was mustered out. He afterwards studied\r\ntheology and retired from active church work in 1905. Augustus was\r\nfirst lieutenant and quartermaster in the same regiment from July 15,\r\n1862, to February 3, 1863, resigning on account of physical debility.\r\nHenry Martyn entered the pay corps of the U. S. Navy in September,\r\n1861, and after serving over forty years, on reaching the age of\r\nsixty-two years was placed on the retired list with the rank of rear\r\nadmiral. Robert served as his assistant from March, 1863, to October,\r\n1863, resigning on account of ill health, and died August, 1864.\r\nAugustus was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1874-1875, and\r\npresident of Orange County Agricultural Society, 1879, to date; also\r\npresident of Highland National Bank, and resides on the old homestead,\r\nwhich he owns.\r\n\r\nWest of Blooming Grove about two miles is located the village of\r\nCraigville, upon the falls of the Greycourt Creek, which formerly\r\nallowed three dams, all now gone, the combined power of which,\r\ntogether with the fact that the stream may be replenished from Walton\r\nLake, or Long Pond, will at some future date be of value, as it was\r\nin the past. On the upper fall was located in the early days a forge,\r\nand some of the old slag is still in evidence. In later years a\r\nsaw-mill and grist-mill were erected by Hector Craig, used afterward\r\nas the first manufactory of Hornby's Oats--H. O. The machinery has\r\nbeen removed since to Buffalo. The second fall was utilized by James\r\nCraig and his son, Hector Craig, for a paper mill in 1790.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Hector Craig, Barrett Ames, a son-in-law of\r\nHector Craig, who had been a cotton merchant in Mobile, and his\r\nson-in-law, E. Peet, erected here a cotton factory, which was\r\noperated successfully for a number of years, but after the death of\r\nMr. Ames, the property passed into other hands, and the cotton\r\nfactory was burned down. Later the high dam was swept away and\r\nnothing remains but the ruins and the old house, which was once\r\nsurrounded by beautiful gardens and was the scene of much social life\r\nwhen the home of Hector Craig, Barrett Ames and Irving Van Wart, who\r\nwas a son-in-law of Mr. Ames. At this home Washington Irving, an\r\nuncle of Irving Van Wart, made one of his last visits, if not his\r\nlast visit, far away from Sunnyside. To this old home came James\r\nCraig, in 1790, from Paisley, Scotland, bringing with him his family.\r\nHis son, Hector Craig, born in Scotland, 1775, married a daughter of\r\nJohn Chandler, 1796. He was a member of Congress, 1823-1825 and\r\n1829-1830. He was a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson, is said to\r\nhave cast the first vote in Congress for Andrew Jackson for\r\nPresident, and was by him appointed surveyor of the port in 1830, and\r\nU. S. commissioner of bankruptcy in 1832. Hector Craig carried on the\r\npaper mill during his life, and also for a time the manufacture of\r\nhemp from the Chester meadows, which had been drained by act of\r\nLegislature in 1790. The old storehouse built by him is still carried\r\non by Edwin Duryea, and the old hotel is still standing, a part of\r\nthe Hornby property. The third fall, much lower, turned the mill of\r\nUncle Silas Seaman and his son, Valentine Seaman, but is now out of\r\nuse, and the property of H. S. Ramsdell. Just beyond the terminus of\r\nthe Blooming Grove and Greycourt turnpike is the old Greycourt\r\nCemetery, the burial place of many respected citizens of this and\r\nadjoining towns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Abimal Youngs House, Oxford Depot, Built 1733]\r\n\r\nTwo miles south of Craigville is situated Oxford Depot, on the Erie\r\nRailroad, with a general country store, kept formerly by Peter B.\r\nTaylor, but for many years the store and post-office have been in\r\ncharge of S. C. Van Vliet, who has also served the town as\r\nsupervisor, justice, etc. Here is also a creamery run by the\r\nAlexander Campbell Co. The old settlement of Satterly's Mills and the\r\nadjacent Campbell Tillotson property are now the beautiful country\r\nresidence of William Crawford, a well-known New York merchant, who is\r\ndoing much to improve that part of the town. Near Oxford Depot is the\r\nbeautiful home of Judge Charles R. Bull, supervisor from 1899 to\r\n1903, and associate judge of County Court, and a lineal descendant of\r\nSarah Wells. The old-time homes of the Seelys and Marvins and the\r\nFletcher Woodhull families, for a long time famous for their\r\nwell-tilled farms, and in the old times well finished fat cattle,\r\nhave passed from their hands, with the single exception of that of\r\nCourtland Marvin, still in the hands of his grand-daughter, Fannie\r\nMarvin, regent of Blooming Grove Chapter, D. A. R., and\r\ngranddaughter of Fannie Woodhull Marvin, mentioned by Eager in his\r\nsketch of Claudius Smith as being used by her mother, wife of Captain\r\nWoodhull, in saving the family silver. The stone house built under\r\nthe supervision of William S. Woodhull is still the property of the\r\nwidow of his son, Jesse Woodhull, who was a daughter of Marcus Sears\r\nand Mary Caldwell. And the Youngs homesteads are still held by their\r\ndescendants, Joseph W. Young, Mrs. Durland and the family of William\r\nB. Hunter. The Bulls in the southern part of the town near Monroe,\r\nstill dwell upon the old homestead. John Brewster, the town clerk of\r\nCornwall, 1765-1799, lived near Blooming Grove, and a part of his old\r\nhomestead remains in the hands of his descendants, Thomas C. and\r\nWalter H. Brewster, who have both been supervisors of the town, and\r\nwhose beautiful homes are beside the Tappan on Satterly's Creek, and\r\nnear the ancestral home of Selah E. Strong, supervisor of Blooming\r\nGrove, 1875-1882, and sheriff of Orange County, 1888-1889-1890, and\r\nis now the home of his widow and their son, Sherwood Strong. This\r\nfine, old home was built by his grandfather, Selah Strong, the first\r\nsupervisor of the new town of Blooming Grove, having been justice of\r\nthe peace for the town of Cornwall for ten years. His father, Major\r\nNathaniel Strong, came to this farm with the Howells and Woodhulls\r\nfrom Long Island, and married Hannah, daughter of Major Nathaniel\r\nWoodhull. He was a prominent citizen, a major in the Continental\r\nArmy, and was murdered in his home on his farm, by the notorious\r\nClaudius Smith, October 6, 1778. This homestead adjoins that of the\r\nStrong family, now occupied by Charles F. Bull, from which came:\r\nMajor Samuel Strong and Captain Nathan Strong, who was at Valley\r\nForge with the Continental Army. The descendants of Samuel Strong now\r\nlive in Blooming Grove on the Benjamin Strong farm, near the\r\nBlooming Grove church, and Charles Strong in Blagg's Clove. This\r\nhomestead adjoins that of Colonel Jesse Woodhull, who settled here on\r\n500 acres of land in 1753, aged eighteen years, a part of which still\r\nremains in the family of N. D. Woodhull. The Woodhull family were\r\ndescendants from Richard Woodhull, born in North Hampton, England,\r\n1620. Zealous for English liberty during the Protectorate, he sought\r\nfreedom here. His grandson, Nathaniel, married into the Smith family,\r\nwho were large proprietors of St. George's Manor, L. I. His daughter,\r\nHannah, married Major Nathaniel Strong. His son, General Nathaniel\r\nWoodhull, remained upon the old homestead at Mastic, Long Island, and\r\ntook an active part in opposing British oppression, and was killed by\r\na British officer, September 2, 1776, tradition says because he would\r\nnot say, \"God save the King.\" Jesse settled in Blagg's Clove, and his\r\nson Richard married Hannah, daughter of Judge William Smith, of Long\r\nIsland, and was the father of William Smith and Nathaniel Du Bois.\r\nWilliam Smith was the father of William Henry Howell and Jesse\r\nWoodhull, and Nathaniel was the father of Richard and Francis\r\nMandeville and grandfather of Nathaniel D. Woodhull, well known in\r\nOrange County as a leader of the New York milk business. Adjoining\r\nthe Woodhull tract is the old Howell homestead to which Hezekiah\r\nHowell came from Long Island about 1730, and tradition says that as\r\nthey came over Schunnemunk Mountain they were obliged to stand by\r\ntheir horses to prevent the wild turkeys from eating up their oats.\r\nHe with Sylvanus White and others took up the patent of 2,000 acres\r\ncalled Blagg's Clove, and he married a daughter of Job Sayre in 1735.\r\nHis son, Hezekiah 2d, was born here, 1741, and married Juliana,\r\ndaughter of Nathaniel Woodhull, of Mastic, L. I. His son, Charles\r\nHowell, was born in 1752, married a daughter of Major Nathaniel\r\nStrong, and after her death, Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Board,\r\nand, settled near the Blooming Grove church, upon a farm of 150\r\nacres, which still remains in the hands of the family of his son,\r\nEdmund S. Howell. He served in the Independent Corps under General\r\nGeorge Clinton in building Fort Putnam, and was on guard after the\r\nburning of Kingston. Hezekiah Howell was the first supervisor of the\r\nold town of Cornwall, and was sheriff of Orange County during the\r\nRevolution. His son, Hezekiah 3d, married Frances, daughter of Major\r\nTuthill, of Orange County. His grandson, Nathaniel W., graduated from\r\nWilliams in the year 1853, was supervisor of Blooming Grove, 1871 and\r\n1872, and a member of Assembly, 1863-1864. He has lived upon the old\r\nHowell homestead, and also inherited his father's farm, and has just\r\nconveyed the whole Howell tract of 700 acres to C. T. Purdy, who is\r\nas closely connected with Sheriff Howell as Nathaniel W. Sylvanus\r\nWhite, Jr., was born on Long Island, Southampton, and was son of\r\nSylvanus and Phoebe Howell. They came with the Howells and Woodhulls\r\nand Strongs and Moffatts, to Blagg's Clove, and settled upon 300\r\nacres of land. His daughter married Anselm Helme, and the family\r\nstill retain the old Helme homestead, near Coleman's Mills. His son,\r\nNathan H. White, was born in 1770, entered Columbia College at the\r\nage of eighteen, and graduated in 1781 in the same class as John\r\nRandolph of Roanoke. He taught a classical school in Montgomery for\r\nsix years, and was principal of the Newburgh Academy two years.\r\nReturning to the old home in 1802, he married Frances, daughter of\r\nHezekiah and Juliana Woodhull Howell and added 200 acres to the old\r\nhomestead. He was elected first judge of Orange County, and was the\r\nfriend and associate of Judges Kent, Van Ness, Platt and others; in\r\n1806 was commissioned by Governor Morgan Lewis, captain of an Orange\r\nCounty Company of Militia. His son, Albert S. White, went to Indiana\r\nabout 1825, was a member of Congress from Indiana two terms, and\r\nU. S. Senator contemporary with Clay, Calhoun and Webster. One\r\ndaughter married Harvey Denniston, and after his death, John Nicoll,\r\nof Washingtonville, and the old White homestead is still held by her\r\nson, Charles Nicoll; and from this union of the Woodhulls with the\r\nStrongs and the Howells and from the Woodhull family came the\r\nnumerous descendants who, together with the Seelys, Tuthills and\r\nMoffatts, Hulses, Hudsons, Duryeas, etc., have combined to make the\r\nold town well known, both at home and in very many distant States,\r\nas one after another has left his ancestral acres to seek a home, if\r\nnot a fortune, in other parts of our native land. Those who remained\r\nat home have kept the ancestral acres up to the standard of\r\nproductiveness set by their fathers, have been the supporters of the\r\nold church and of the schools, and have erected beautiful homes.\r\n\r\nInstead of the droves of fatted cattle which slowly wended their way\r\nthrough the Ramapo Valley to the Christmas market in the city, and\r\nthe county butter, now the Erie Railroad carries its daily freight of\r\nmilk, and the accustomed leisure, the good old-fashioned all-day\r\nvisits, and early teas, have given way to the daily rush to the\r\ntrains, or creameries, and the more elaborate, though no more\r\nenjoyable festal occasions, with formal invitations and great\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nWho shall succeed these old families who have so loyally supported\r\nthe Church, the State and the School? Shall their fine residences,\r\nwhich now crown the hilltops, with their beautiful views, and the\r\nvalleys with their peaceful streams, attract the residents of the\r\nnearby cities, as the neighboring town of Monroe is doing? Or will\r\nthese homes pass into the hands of those who have to labor for their\r\ndaily bread, day by day, and neither the one nor the other caring for\r\nthe traditions of the past, caring not for the old churches, the old\r\nburial grounds, nor anything of the past.\r\n\r\nThis question comes home to many of us, as we see the changes going\r\non about us, and we cannot answer.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES AND PASTORS.\r\n\r\nThe first house of worship was erected in Blooming Grove, 1759. The\r\nold church stood until 1823, when the present building was erected.\r\nThe first pastor was Rev. Enos Ayres, who stood first on the roll of\r\nthe first class graduated at Princeton College. He died in 1762 and\r\nwas buried in the old burial ground, a part of which, including his\r\ngrave and the graves of Rev. Samuel Parkhurst and Rev. Benoni\r\nBradner, was covered by the new church building. In 1764 he was\r\nsucceeded by Rev. Abner Reeve, father of the celebrated Judge Reeve,\r\nwho founded the law school at Litchfield, Conn. Rev. Abner Reeve\r\nresigned about 1786. In 1786, Rev. Samuel Parkhurst came as a supply\r\nand soon died here, and his grave is also under the present church.\r\nThen followed, in 1770, Rev. Anasiah Lewis, Rev. Case, Rev. Green\r\nand Rev. Silas Constant, as stated supplies for a time. Rev. Benoni\r\nBradner filled the pulpit from 1786 until 1892, dying in 1804. He was\r\nburied here, his stone still standing erect under the church. After\r\nhis retirement Rev. Joel T. Benedict preached a few months, Rev. Noah\r\nCrane, 1803 to 1811. He was succeeded by Rev. William Rafferty, who\r\nmarried a daughter of John Chandler and resigned in 1815, to become\r\npresident of St. John's College, Annapolis, Maryland. Returning on a\r\nvisit in 1830, he died here, and is buried in the old Chandler family\r\nburial ground on the old homestead now occupied by B. C. Sears.\r\nAugust 7, 1816, Rev. Luther Halsey was installed as pastor. The\r\nchurch was admitted under the care of the Presbytery, with the\r\nreservation of its form of government, and remained in the\r\nPresbytery of Hudson until 1833, but has always been in fact\r\nCongregational. Rev. Luther Halsey served the church with great\r\nacceptance. Great revivals blessed his ministry, at one time nearly\r\none hundred being added to the church. The present church building\r\nwas erected under his ministry, and frequently filled. He resigned\r\nin 1824 to accept a professorship in Nassau Hall; later became\r\nprofessor of theology in Allegheny, in Auburn, and in Union\r\nSeminaries. He died in Pittsburgh on November 2, 1880, aged\r\neighty-seven years. He was succeeded at Blooming Grove by James\r\nArbuckle, then pastor of the Eighth Presbyterian Church of\r\nPhiladelphia, who was pastor of the church until his death, July,\r\n1847. In 1847, Rev. Ebenezer Mason, son of the celebrated John M.\r\nMason, D.D., of New York City, became pastor, who died here the next\r\nyear. After his death the pulpit was supplied until April, 1851, when\r\nRev. Austin Craig was called, and served this church for fourteen\r\nyears, when he resigned to accept the presidency of Antioch College,\r\nOhio, and later was president of the Biblical School at\r\nStanfordville, Dutchess County, N. Y., where he died, but is still\r\nheld in loving remembrance by many of the congregation and in the\r\ntown. He was succeeded in April, 1866, by Rev. Warren Hathaway, D.D.,\r\nwho still occupies the pulpit. Although he has had frequent calls to\r\nwhat seems to have been more attractive fields of labor, he still\r\nremains loyal to his old congregation and they to him. Both Eager and\r\nRuttenber, to whom we are indebted for part of the facts herein\r\nstated, excuse a lengthy report of this old church, because of its\r\nbeing one of the landmarks of the town, and it still stands for\r\nrighteousness, temperance, and charity toward all those laboring for\r\nthe good of their fellowmen, but the congregation is greatly changed.\r\nIn the place of the Marvins, and Seelys, Moffatts and Roes, who came\r\nin large loads containing the whole families, come very few of those\r\nstill left of the Woodhulls and Marvins. Although the Tuthills and\r\nthe Shons, who represent the old Moffatt family, the Hulses and\r\nHudsons, Gerows and Sears, and Howells and Brewsters, still\r\ncontribute their quotas toward the congregation, there are many\r\nvacant pews, and very many who trooped up the long aisles, and\r\nlistened attentively to the instructive and eloquent sermons, and\r\nvisited upon the old door stones, are seen there no more. In place of\r\nthe tall form of David H. Moffatt, Jr., who used to lead the choir in\r\nthe old gallery, stands the handsome pipe organ erected to his\r\nfather's memory by David H. Moffatt, of Denver. And the church has a\r\nfund in memory of David Wright, given by his daughter Susan Wright.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, an effort was made to start an Episcopal church in\r\nWashingtonville, but met with no success. August 21, 1851, under the\r\nleadership of Rev. Henry Belden, a Congregational church was\r\norganized, and a building erected, which was afterward sold to the\r\nMethodist congregation, incorporated 1855. The First Presbyterian\r\nChurch of Washingtonville was organized 1841. Connected with the\r\nHudson Presbytery under the charge of Rev. Henry Belden the church\r\ngrew to a membership of 121, when Rev. Henry Belden was succeeded by\r\nRev. Phineas Robinson. A church building was erected in 1847, and\r\nRev. Luther Halsey was called to succeed him and occupied the pulpit\r\nuntil October, 1856. Rev. Daniel Higbee served the church from\r\nAugust, 1858, until his death, October, 1867. He was succeeded by\r\nJohn Griswold, who served until April, 1871, when he was succeeded by\r\nRev. James B. Beaumont, 1871 to 1881, George W. Morrill from 1882 to\r\n1884, when an effort to unite the congregations of the First and\r\nSecond Churches was made, but failed. In 1886, Rev. Joseph Greenleaf\r\nwas called, and died in 1888. William M. Yeoman was pastor from 1898\r\nto October, 1902. John A. McCallum, installed 1903, resigned June 20,\r\n1907, leaving the church without a pastor at this date. Their church\r\nproperty has been increased by a new parsonage, 1872, and a handsome\r\nchapel and Sunday schoolroom, to the memory of Mary Scott Denniston,\r\nthe widow of Hon. Robert Denniston, erected by her children.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Dr. Luther Halsey, having a matter of difference with the\r\nNew School Assembly, did not feel he could any longer remain under\r\nits care, and many of his congregation joining with him, they formed\r\nthe Old School Presbyterian Church of Washingtonville. The church was\r\norganized in 1857, a house of worship built in 1858, and a parsonage\r\nadded in 1871. Dr. Luther Halsey occupied the pulpit until April,\r\n1862, when Rev. Arthur Harlow was called and ordained and installed,\r\nSeptember, 1863; resigned in October, 1871, and died June 19, 1883.\r\nIn 1872, B. G. Benedict became stated supply until 1875, when on\r\naccount of ill health he resigned and was succeeded by Rev. N. M.\r\nSherwood, who served the church ten years, resigning in 1885 in\r\norder that his occupying the pulpit might not embarrass the effort\r\nto unite the two Presbyterian churches. This effort failing, Rev.\r\nEugene L. Mapes was called, April, 1886; installed 1887, and resigned\r\na year later, having received a call to the Presbyterian church of\r\nCarlisle, Pa. The church was then supplied for some time, and then\r\nsold its property, and divided the proceeds between the Foreign and\r\nHome Mission Boards of the Presbyterian Church, part of the\r\ncongregation giving to the First Presbyterian Church and part to the\r\nold Blooming Grove Church, and part to Bethlehem and Little Britain.\r\n\r\n_The Blooming Grove Methodist Episcopal Church_ was incorporated\r\nDecember 3, 1855. This is now the _Washingtonville Methodist Church._\r\nIt was for a long time on the circuit of Monroe, Oxford, Craigville\r\nand Highland Mills, but now is associated with the church at\r\nSalisbury Mills, has a fine church property, kept in very good\r\nrepair, and has recently installed electric lights in connection with\r\nother improvements.\r\n\r\n_The Catholic Church of St. Mary_ is near Washingtonville on the\r\nState road, the first building erected in 1872, has been of late much\r\nenlarged and beautified under the direction and by the effort of Rev.\r\nFather Tetrau, and now has a fine property consisting of the enlarged\r\nchurch and rectory.\r\n\r\n_The Methodist Church of Salisbury Mills_ was incorporated in 1854,\r\nwas connected with the New Windsor circuit until 1898, when it was\r\nconnected with Washingtonville. It has a convenient and finely\r\nlocated building.\r\n\r\nIn Salisbury, largely through the efforts of Richard Caldwell and his\r\nwife, Sarah Beattie Caldwell, the Hope Chapel, connected with the\r\n_Bethlehem Presbyterian Congregation,_ was built, and has been an\r\nactive organization ever since, and its Sunday school, supported by\r\nits founders, is large and active, and Sunday evening and other\r\nservices well attended.\r\n\r\n_The Satterly Town Methodist Church_ was organized in 1855, a house\r\nbuilt and services held for some time, but its supporters,\r\nwithdrawing or moving from the neighborhood, the building was\r\nremoved. Also about 1850 a church was erected at Craigville, for the\r\nuse of that village and neighborhood, which soon passed into the\r\nhands of the Methodist organization, and was on the circuit with\r\nWashingtonville for many years, but service has for a long time been\r\ndiscontinued, though the building still stands in fair repair and is\r\nbeautifully situated. Still another Methodist church was built about\r\none mile south of Oxford Depot and used for the purpose of worship,\r\nbut now has been turned to secular use; also near this was the\r\nFriends meeting house, now used as a dwelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF CHESTER.\r\n\r\nBy Frank Durland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChester is one of the interior towns of Orange County, situated on\r\nthe main line Erie Railroad, which together with the Newburgh branch,\r\nLehigh and Hudson and Orange County Railroads, make up the chief\r\ncommercial outlets to the ports on the Hudson and Delaware Rivers.\r\n\r\nIt consists of over sixteen thousand acres of fine farming land and\r\nis a noted dairy and stock farming section of the Empire State.\r\nConsiderable enterprise has been shown in recent years in the\r\nculture of onions, celery and lettuce on the Greycourt meadows, which\r\nare among the most fertile of all the alluvial deposits of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe title of most of the land of the township is from the famous\r\nWawayanda patent, which covered the land deeded by the twelve native\r\nIndian proprietors, who signed a deed, March 5, 1703, for all the\r\nland from the high hills of the Hudson to the Shawangunk Mountains\r\nand the Jersey line. The highest points of vantage in Chester\r\ntownship, from which magnificent views may be obtained of the whole\r\nWawayanda country, are Sugar Loaf Mountain, 1,220 feet elevation, and\r\nGoose Pond Mountain, 826 feet above the sea level. From these\r\npinnacles may be seen the Catskills, which are much higher and\r\nfurther removed than the Shawangunk range of mountains.\r\n\r\nThe elevation in Chester village at Durland Square is 485 feet, and\r\non the ridge back of the Presbyterian Church, extending toward\r\nCraigville, may be obtained extended views of a large portion of\r\nOrange County, spread out in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe H. W. Wood hills at East Chester, the T. S. Durland ridge at\r\nGreycourt, and the Guy Miller gravel hill, each have a magnificent\r\noutlook over a large scope of the country from Schunnemunk to\r\nShawangunk. In the valleys between these ridges are the old highways\r\nfollowing in some instances, Indian trails. It is but natural that\r\nalong these roads the present village should have grown up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frank Durland]\r\n\r\nThe road from Newburgh through Chester to Trenton and Morristown,\r\nN. J., is often spoken of in the Clinton papers and in more recent\r\nyears it has been known as the King's Highway. It has been a noted\r\nroad since Colonial days, having often been used by General\r\nWashington during the Revolutionary War. It is the natural avenue for\r\nintercourse between Newburgh and New Jersey. Crossing this road at\r\nDurland's Square is the old Albany and New York stage road, which\r\nenters the town of Chester at the Goshen line and to the metropolis\r\ncontinues its course southward near Greycourt. Leaving this old stage\r\nroad at Nanowitt Park, which has been recently donated to the town of\r\nChester by Rev. E. T. Sanford, pastor of the North Baptist Church of\r\nNew York City, is the old Indian trail, which became a popular road\r\nduring the Colonial days and leads to Greenwood Lake and to the\r\nancient Sterling Iron Works. This road was traveled by Peter\r\nTownsend, one of the owners of the Sterling Iron Works, who lived in\r\nChester during the Revolution, and whose descendants continued to\r\nreside here for many years.\r\n\r\nThere is also the new State road, No. 600, following quite closely\r\nthe old Albany and New York road, excepting the course from Monroe\r\nto Chester is changed from the east to the west side of the Erie\r\nRailroad. The famous Glenmere Lake, formerly known as Thompson's\r\nPond, is partly in the town of Chester, and is noted for its pickerel\r\nand bass fishing. Its area is about 400 acres.\r\n\r\nThe streams of the town are known as the Otter Kill, which flows\r\nthrough West Chester and is joined at Lincolndale by the Cromeline\r\nCreek, which was known in Colonial days as the \"River.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cromeline has its sources of supply near the northern headwaters\r\nof Greenwood Lake in the watershed known as \"Dutch Hollow;\" also from\r\nthe outlet of Walton Lake, known in Colonial days as the \"Little\r\nLong Pond\" to distinguish it from Greenwood Lake, which in the early\r\nperiod of our history was known as Long Pond. Along the Cromeline\r\nCreek are the fertile meadows formerly known as the Great Beaver\r\nmeadows.\r\n\r\nSince the erection of the Cromeline house in the year 1716, which\r\nstood on the south side of the road opposite the present home of\r\nW. R. Conklin, the meadows have been known as the Greycourt meadows,\r\nfrom the fact that this Cromeline house was known as the Greycourt\r\nInn. This name was also given to the cemetery, near this old inn, and when\r\nthe Erie Railroad was built in 1841, this name was applied to the\r\njunction of the Erie Railroad with the Newburgh branch and the\r\nWarwick Valley, first called East and West Junction, afterwards\r\nChesterville, and finally the euphonious name of Greycourt was\r\ndecided upon as the name appropriate for the station adjoining these\r\nfamous Greycourt meadows.\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL AND REVOLUTIONARY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of August, 1775, the Provincial Congress of New York\r\npassed a law under which the militia of the Revolution was organized.\r\n\r\nThe several companies so formed were directed to be joined into\r\nregiments to consist of not less than five nor more than ten\r\ncompanies. When the organization was perfected, the companies of\r\nOrange formed the Fourth Brigade under Brigadier General George\r\nClinton. This brigade was composed of four companies of Ulster and\r\nfive of Orange County, commanded respectively by Colonel Allison,\r\nwhose regimental district included Goshen, of which Chester was then\r\na part, and the western part of the county. There were Colonel\r\nHathorn, whose district embraced Warwick and the settlements; Colonel\r\nWoodhull, the district which is now Monroe and Blooming Grove;\r\nColonel Hasbrouck's district, embracing Newburgh and vicinity;\r\nColonel Clinton's of New Windsor, Montgomery and Wallkill.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the war our people (located, as they were,\r\nnot far removed from the Hudson) were almost constantly under arms\r\nor engaged in the construction of the forts of the Highlands, or\r\npreparing the obstructions to navigation through these Highlands.\r\n\r\nThe contract for the making of the last chain drawn across the\r\nHudson at West Point, on April 30, 1778, was awarded at the home of\r\nMr. Peter Townsend, who resided at this time in the old homestead\r\nopposite the Presbyterian Church, in Chester village, by Secretary\r\nof War, Mr. Pickering. Mr. Townsend, of the firm of Townsend & Noble,\r\nat this time was one of the owners of the Sterling furnace, where the\r\nchain was made.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1776 to 1779 our troops were very active and were\r\nkept informed by the aid of cannon firing by day and beacon fires by\r\nnight. From December, 1776, to April, 1778, our militia was called\r\nout no less than twelve times and spent 292 days in the field.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the County Delegates called to meet at the Yelverton\r\nInn (still standing in Chester), on September 17, 1774, Henry Wisner\r\nwas elected and sent as a delegate to the Continental Congress at\r\nPhiladelphia, \"to protest against the unjust taxation.\" On December\r\n9, 1776, General Clinton was ordered to co-operate with Generals\r\nLee and Gates to harass the enemy, who had then entered northern\r\nNew Jersey. The resolution read as follows: \"That all the militia of\r\nOrange and Ulster Counties be forthwith ordered to march properly\r\narmed and accoutered with four days' provision to Chester, Orange\r\nCounty, N. Y.\"\r\n\r\nThis fixes the date of the encampment of these troops on the hill\r\nwhere the present new modern school-house is being erected, as being\r\nabout the latter part of December, 1776, or January, 1777. The\r\nencampment probably consisted of part of the four regiments, under\r\nColonels Allison, Hathorn, Woodhull and Clinton. An order was issued\r\non January 4, 1777, dismissing part of these troops, leaving about\r\n300 men in the above camp for the winter.\r\n\r\nOne of the first engagements in which our Chester patriots took part,\r\noccurred at Suffern, October 3, 1777, when Major Thomas Moffatt\r\nordered Captain Wood and twenty men to cover the pass through the\r\nmountains at this point, where they intercepted a band of Tories,\r\nwith the result of one robber killed and three wounded.\r\n\r\nOur company was engaged under Colonel Allison later on at Forts\r\nMontgomery and Clinton. While these events were transpiring on the\r\nHudson, the western frontier was harassed by the incursions of the\r\nIndians and Tories under the leadership of the educated half-breed\r\nBrant, together with Butler the Tory. Our troops becoming alarmed by\r\nthe fugitives' accounts of the massacres and burnings taking place on\r\nthe frontier, Colonel Hathorn, together with Lieutenant Colonel\r\nTusten, of Colonel Allison's Goshen Regiment, and with such numbers\r\nof the commands as could be brought together in so brief a time,\r\nproceeded at once to Minisink, on July 22, 1779, to take part in that\r\nbloody battle on this date. Several of our Chester Company were\r\namong the brave troops.\r\n\r\nSUBSEQUENT HISTORICAL INCIDENTS.\r\n\r\nAfter the Revolutionary War and until 1845, the village of Chester\r\nwas a part of the township of Goshen, and had become quite an\r\nimportant trading center, being at the junction of the two leading\r\nState roads. Up to the time of the building of the Warwick Valley\r\nroad, in 1863, now the Lehigh and Hudson, the pig iron from Wawayanda\r\nLake forge was carted to Chester for shipment on the Erie, the butter\r\nand other farm produce from the Vernon Valley, extending as far as\r\nNewton, N. J., was also brought to this point for shipment. It was\r\nbut natural that the trial to decide the boundaries of the Chesekook\r\nand Wawayanda Indian patents should have been held at this place. In\r\nthe year 1785, in the barn connected with the Yelverton Inn, erected\r\nin the year 1765, still standing, in good state of preservation, and\r\nowned by Joseph Durland, some of the older inhabitants and pioneers\r\nof Orange County met with the nation's most famous lawyers,\r\nAlexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. The Wawayanda patentees were\r\nfortunate in securing these men during this trial, and many\r\nhistorical facts were brought out, through the witnesses sworn at\r\nthis trial. In their testimony concerning what they knew about the\r\nearly settlement of the country and the relations of the whites to\r\nthe native Indians, the evidence was set forth. The burden of the\r\ntestimony seemed to prove that Schunnemunk was not considered by the\r\npioneers as the high hills of the Hudson. On this trial, Judge Elihu\r\nMarvin stated \"that he was born in 1719 and moved in what is now\r\nknown as the town of Chester in 1742. Whenever he visited Haverstraw\r\nand returned as far as the Ramapo River, it was always called beyond\r\nthe High Hills of the Hudson.\"\r\n\r\nHugh Dobbin, aged seventy-six, stated \"that he lived near Sugar Loaf\r\nMountain since 1738.\"\r\n\r\nDeliverance Conkling, who lived near Wickham's Pond, stated \"that he\r\nwas 71 years old, and has known personally Lancaster Symes, one of\r\nthe Wawayanda patentees, and the pond at Goose Pond Mountain used to\r\nbe called Cromeline Pond, and abounded in wild geese.\"\r\n\r\nSamuel Gale was born in 1737, and testified \"that the Chesekooks\r\nline had always been disputed.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Thompson was born in 1723, was chain bearer for Colonel\r\nClinton and usually stopped, when surveying the Chesekook patent,\r\nat Perry's near Wickham's Pond. He had talked with the Indians and\r\nremained at times in their wigwams.\r\n\r\nEbenezer Holly, born 1698, stated that he knew Captain Symes,\r\nCaptain Aske, Christopher Denn and Daniel Cromeline. In dispute with\r\nthe Indians, Governor Burnet had decided that the Indians must move\r\noff the land; among the Indians who still claimed land were Rondout,\r\nHons and Romer. He stated that Cromeline made his first improvement\r\nat Greycourt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. Headden]\r\n\r\nJohn Kinner, a Chester resident, held land in this disputed tract\r\nunder Mr. Wisner, Dr. Baird and Mr. Scott.\r\n\r\nJames Board, aged sixty-five, born in England in 1720, came to this\r\ncountry with his father, Cornelius, and brother, David, in 1730;\r\nsent by Alexander, Lord Sterling, to discover copper mines;\r\ndiscovered iron ore deposits at Sterling, built there a forge in\r\n1735, and in the year of 1740 removed to Ringwood. The mountains west\r\ntoward Warwick were called by that name. The Sugar Loaf Mountain was\r\ncalled by that name as long as he remembered.\r\n\r\nSoon after the forge was going it was sold by Cornelius Board & Sons\r\nto Coldon & Ward.\r\n\r\nDuring this trial Burr and Hamilton were guests at the old Yelverton\r\nInn. The court adjourned to meet again at Chester, in Yelverton barn,\r\nin October, 1785, at which session it was decided that Chesekook\r\npatent should comprise all the land east of Goose Pond Mountain and\r\nthe great Beaver Meadows, to the western line of Evans patent and the\r\nHudson River.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, living in and about West\r\nChester, were Joseph Durland, born in 1762, Benjamin Dunning, Daniel\r\nDenton, James Roe and Michael Renton. On the Florida road lived\r\nThaddeus Seely and Major Holbert. At Chester lived Asa Vail opposite\r\nthe second academy, Edmund Seely, Seth Satterly and Dr. Townsend\r\nSeely. Peter Townsend lived opposite the Presbyterian church. Isaac\r\nand William Townsend on the C. B. Wood ridge, Elmer Cooper and Dr.\r\nDodd, Aaron Cox, the hatter, and Stephen Cooper, born in 1788; David\r\nG. Drake, born in 1760. The old Samuel Satterly house stood on the\r\nbrow of the hill, nearly opposite the joining of Old New York road,\r\nnear the new State road; from this point at the bridge, which was\r\ncalled in these early days the \"Purgatory Bridge,\" the most popular\r\namusement was running races. The course lay from this bridge to the\r\noak tree, which is still standing near H. W. Wood's residence. On\r\nspecial days, July 4, and in the autumn, the people from miles around\r\nfairly lined the short course in numbers from three to four hundred\r\npeople. In fact, nearly double the number of our whole population at\r\nthat period. Purses were usually made up at such times at the course,\r\nand great horses contested. Among them were Webber's \"Kentucky Whip,\"\r\na great running sire from Kentucky; Tom Thumb and Saltrum. The\r\nvisitation of such noted running stock to Chester was the beginning\r\nof an improvement in the racing stock of this section. This\r\ndevelopment found its climax in the birth of Hambletonian, the\r\nprogenitor of the American trotter.\r\n\r\nWhen the old \"Hero of Chester\" died in 1876, he was buried on the\r\nhill on the W. M. Rysdyck place. Since that time a granite shaft\r\ncosting $3,000, has been erected, to mark the resting place of this\r\nnotable sire.\r\n\r\nAbout 100 years ago Isaac Kinner and Daniel Cooley lived on the\r\nwestern foothills of the Goose Pond Mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the Craigville road lived Dr. John Boulton, Birdseye Young,\r\nAlbert Seely, Samuel Denton, Hezekiah Moffatt and Jesse Carpenter.\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF A CENTURY.\r\n\r\nAbout 1721, we find John Yelverton, of New Windsor, in this section.\r\nThe deed recorded, 1765, by his grandson and executor, Abijah\r\nYelverton, who kept the Yelverton Inn, in old Chester village,\r\nconveys three parcels of land in 1721 in Goshen to John Yelverton,\r\nin trust \"for a parsonage, minister's house and burying place; also\r\nto build a meeting house thereon or a public edifice for the worship\r\nof God in the way and manner of those of the Presbyterian\r\npersuasion,\" signed by twenty-four land owners in the different parts\r\nof the Wawayanda patent. This has reference to the Goshen\r\nPresbyterian church. During this period Chester, with the rest of this\r\npart of the county, was included in the precinct of Goshen.\r\n\r\nRichard Edsall's survey, made in 1741, mentions William Seely and\r\nRulof Swartwout as living in this neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe township of Chester is well arranged for the transaction of\r\npublic business, and is the practical outcome of the ambitions of a\r\nprogressive century. In 1845 from the towns of Goshen, Warwick,\r\nBlooming Grove and Monroe, the township was organized with James\r\nGray as its first supervisor, 1845.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. B. Wood]\r\n\r\nThe first deed that we find made mention of was John Beers as owning\r\n120 acres of the Cromeline patent; he sold the same June 16, 1751, to\r\nJohn Ensign, who in turn sold 42-3/4 acres of the tract, on May 19,\r\n1755, to John Yelverton, gentleman, for the sum of 97L. and 4S.\r\ncurrent money. Upon this land the village of Chester is located.\r\n\r\nMany familiar names of the families living in our township to-day are\r\nfound on the assessment rolls of dist. No. 4, town of Goshen, of\r\nSeptember, 1775, signed by Nathaniel Roe.\r\n\r\nThis district may be described as running from Greycourt to\r\nSatterlytown, Sugar Loaf to Summerville, to Fort Hill, with no less\r\nthan 119 land owners with an assessed valuation of 370L. 8S. 17D.\r\n\r\nAbijah Yelverton, in the year of 1783, gave an acre of ground for\r\nchurch purposes. The year 1797 saw the beginning of the first meeting\r\nhouse. In 1708 the first minister began his labors in the\r\nPresbyterian church at $75 per annum, \"with the privilege of teaching\r\nto piece out his support.\" This meeting house stood on the high\r\nground in the rear of the residence of Dr. S. G. Carpenter, in the\r\nold village of Chester. It was commodious for the time, with square\r\npews, but was used without being heated. The next church was built\r\nin 1829, and was located about the center of the present cemetery at\r\nEast Chester.\r\n\r\nOur earliest district school-house stood opposite the Dr. Edmonston\r\nhome in the old village. It was erected during the latter part of\r\n1700. Another was located on the Goshen road near Dr. A. T. Sanden's\r\nresidence. Long before the noise of railroads disturbed the quiet of\r\nour hamlet, the mails were brought by the old stage coach.\r\n\r\nChester was favorably situated for the exchange of mails, the Goshen\r\nstage running through here to meet the Newburgh and New York stage\r\nline at Southfield and the Warwick stage line, using our road to\r\nconnect with the same line at Washingtonville.\r\n\r\nThe first post-office was established in Chester in 1794. Joseph\r\nWickham being the first postmaster located at West Chester, then and\r\nnow a part of Chester village, afterward it was moved to the old\r\nvillage and in 1842 was removed to the building opposite the present\r\nErie Railroad tower at Chester Station. The idea of offering fresh\r\nmilk from the country to the distant consumer in the city originated\r\nwith a road contractor named Selleck who interested some of our\r\nleading farmers in the project and succeeded in getting a supply\r\nsent by the Erie in the spring of 1842. It was shipped in the blue\r\npyramid churns of that day. The first shipment were about six cans\r\nper day and freight charges were by weight, twenty cents per hundred\r\npounds. The price paid the producer was two cents per quart, placed\r\non the cars at Chester. The farmers soon finding that there was more\r\nmoney to be made from milk at two cents per quart than butter at\r\nfifteen cents per pound, began sending milk to Selleck. Thus the\r\nmilk business of the county was born, and in spite of the many\r\ndifficulties, this business has alone been the means of building four\r\nrailroads in Orange County and returned to it over $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 mention is made of a saw-mill on the trout brook, on the\r\nSterling road. These mills are now known as Bull's Mills. A\r\ngrist-mill was then operated on the opposite side of the stream. The\r\nold flouring mill at West Chester was established soon after the\r\nsettlement was made. As late as the year 1820, an old mill stood upon\r\nthe ground just above the present Chester mills. During these times\r\nthey used two run of stone and never were compelled to shut down for\r\nlack of water.\r\n\r\nChester's first library was incorporated November 17, 1779, with\r\nseven trustees, and was verified before Judge Wickham and recorded\r\nthe same year. Abijah Yelverton was the first librarian.\r\n\r\nThe war of 1861 occasioned a great demand for onions and our onion\r\nculture on the black meadows began about that time. Our average\r\nyearly production has been about 60,000 bushels. During revolutionary\r\ntimes a part of these meadows were cultivated for raising hemp;\r\nlater on, potatoes and corn.\r\n\r\nINCORPORATION.\r\n\r\nThe movement for both our present water supply and for the\r\nincorporation of the village first took effective shape in the year\r\n1891, when a few public-spirited citizens of the village subscribed\r\nto a fund to be expended in a survey to determine whether the water\r\nof Little Long Pond, now known as \"Walton Lake,\" could be brought to\r\nthe village under such pressure as would make it available for fire\r\nprotection. The preliminary survey was made under the direction of\r\nJoseph Board and George M. Roe. The facts were convincing that this\r\nwas a most favorable project for a water supply. First, the\r\norganization of a private company was proposed, and from this\r\ndeveloped the incorporation of our village, the citizens realizing\r\nthat if we were to have a water supply it must be owned by the\r\nvillage. Accordingly this was done with the happy result that has\r\nmade us the envy of our neighboring villages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joseph Board]\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 1892, Mr. Joseph Board was appointed as resident\r\nsuperintendent in the construction of the water works, and when the\r\nwater was turned on, in exactly a year, October 17, 1893, the\r\ninhabitants of our village had the satisfaction of knowing that each\r\nlength of pipe so laid had been under the inspection of our\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\nThe village of Chester was incorporated June 23, 1892. having a\r\npopulation of 1,400; 125 voters favored the incorporation and only\r\nthe small number of thirteen opposed the proposition. At the first\r\ncaucus, held July 12, 1892, were nominated W. A. Lawrence as\r\npresident; Joseph Durland, George M. Roe and Thad. S. Durland,\r\ntrustees. At the first election, held July 20, 1892, the above\r\ncitizens were elected to their respective offices. The village board\r\nwas organized on the same date, naming Joseph Board as village clerk.\r\n\r\nThe board of water commissioners was organized August 15, 1892, with\r\nMessrs. W. A. Lawrence, Joseph Durland, George M. Roe and T. S.\r\nDurland as commissioners, and Joseph Board, clerk. A taxpayers'\r\nmeeting was called September 2, 1892, to vote on the question of\r\nassessment for water-works, with the following results: Sixty-eight\r\nin favor, against seven. Contract was executed at a total cost of\r\n$53,000 at their final completion.\r\n\r\nThis water supply for the village of Chester is one of the best in\r\nthe State. The source is Walton Lake, formerly known as Little Long\r\nPond, a beautiful sheet of spring water, covering an area of 127\r\nacres, with a storage capacity of 3-1/2 feet, each foot of water\r\ngiving a supply of over 40,000,000 gallons. This supply is a gravity\r\nsystem. From this lake, at an elevation of 250 feet above the level\r\nof Main street, at Chester Station, giving a working pressure of 80\r\nto 90 pounds, there was laid for water-mains, 8,197 feet of 12-in.\r\npipe, 6,978 feet of 19-in. pipe, 14,820 feet of 8-in. pipe, 5,748\r\nfeet of 6-in. pipe, 6,312 feet of 4-in. pipe.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of Walton Lake water, both the Walton Hose\r\nCompany and Hook and Ladder Company have been organized.\r\n\r\nAfter the incorporation the present municipal brick building was\r\nerected at a cost of $5,000. In this building rooms for village\r\nofficers and parlors used by the fire department are located. In\r\nconnection with our fire department, there is an annual inspection at\r\nwhich time the Chester military band of twenty-five members, under\r\nthe leadership of George W. Ball, adds greatly to the village life.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1905, the Orange and Rockland Electric Company was\r\norganized, with R. W. Smith as president, and G. M. Roe as\r\nvice-president; Zael Paddleford, secretary; Frank Durland, treasurer.\r\nThis company was organized and stock subscribed for by the citizens\r\nof Chester and Monroe.\r\n\r\nThe streets of the village, which were formerly lighted by kerosene,\r\nare now illuminated by electric current, generated by this company.\r\nOur Telford streets were laid in the year 1901, at a cost of $17,000.\r\nA distance of two and one-quarter miles were constructed through the\r\nmain streets of the village.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\n_The Presbyterian Church of Chester,_ while it had been ministering\r\nto the spiritual needs of the community for more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury, effected its legal organization December 26, 1826, with\r\nDavid Roe, Henry Seely, James Holbert, Elnathan Satterly, Joseph\r\nSherwood and Townsend Seely as trustees.\r\n\r\nThe present house of worship, being the third erected by this\r\ncongregation, was dedicated January 4, 1854. The present chapel was\r\nadded in the year 1884. The church was remodeled and memorial windows\r\nadded in the year 1898. In the year 1898 the church celebrated the\r\ncentennial of its existence with impressive services and the\r\npublication of an interesting history of its century of church life.\r\n\r\nThe commodious parsonage adjoining the church was erected in 1895 at\r\na cost of about $8,000.\r\n\r\n_Methodist Episcopal Church, Sugar Loaf._--Rev. Isaac Condee was the\r\nfirst Methodist preacher to visit Sugar Loaf, which he did in the\r\nyear 1803 or 1804, and first preached in the home of John D. Conklin.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1804 he organized the first class and appointed John\r\nD. Conklin, leader. It is the mother of all the Methodist churches\r\nwithin a radius of ten or twelve miles.\r\n\r\nThe certificate of incorporation was executed on August 6, 1809. The\r\ntrustees then chosen were Henry Wisner, Jr., Joseph Beach, Andrew\r\nCunningham, Benjamin Wells, Richard Wisner, Horace Ketchem, Elijah\r\nStevens, John D. Conklin and Benjamin Horton.\r\n\r\nA subscription was taken and the first church was built in year 1810.\r\nTen years later, in the year 1820, the Sunday school was established.\r\nThe parsonage was erected in the year 1832. The second church, the\r\npresent building, was built in 1852, and at three separate times it\r\nhas undergone repairs. Rev. J. B. Wakeley, D.D., preached the sermon\r\nat the dedication of the church in the year 1852, and following the\r\nextensive repairs to the church, made in 1872, Bishop Cyrus D. Foss\r\npreached the dedication sermon. The church celebrated the centennial\r\nof its existence in the fall of 1904, at which time many of the\r\nformer pastors were present to participate in the services, when\r\nBishop Foss was again present.\r\n\r\nA long list of worthy men have served this church as pastors. Rev.\r\nP. N. Chase, Ph.D., is at present in charge; M. D. Stevens,\r\nsuperintendent of the Sunday school; Miss Alice Turfler, president of\r\nthe Epworth league.\r\n\r\n_The Methodist Episcopal Church of Chester_ was organized in the year\r\n1837, and for some time used the academy for worship; afterwards used\r\nthe \"Ball Room\" of Yelverton Inn. In the year 1852 the present\r\nproperty was purchased and the church, edifice erected in charge of\r\nthe following trustees:\r\n\r\nC. B. Wood, W. L. Foster, Daniel Conklin, S. R. Banker, John T.\r\nJohnson, William Masterson, G. B. McCabe.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the church was enlarged and in 1878 the present parsonage was\r\npurchased. In the year 1879 the sum of $3,000 was expended in\r\nbeautifying the church building.\r\n\r\n_St. Paul's Episcopal Church._--The organization of St. Paul's\r\nEpiscopal Mission was effected on May 25, 1897, at which time Samuel\r\nWilkins and James A. Parkin were elected trustees. Services were held\r\nin various places until the summer of 1898, when land was purchased\r\nand the present church edifice on Main street was erected. The church\r\nwas dedicated by Archdeacon William R. Thomas, D.D., on August 6,\r\n1898. The church was consecrated by Bishop Henry Cadman Potter on\r\nJuly 25, 1899. Prior to this, the usual organization of the\r\nEpiscopal Church was effected. Mr. Samuel Wilkin and R. W.\r\nChamberlain, wardens, were elected. J. A. Parkin, E. T. Jackson and\r\nW. F. Depew, vestrymen. Articles of incorporation were filed on\r\nFebruary 27, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman, Rev. J. Holmes McGuinness, D.D., at this time was\r\nelected.\r\n\r\n_St. John's African Union Chapel._--This church was organized on June\r\n22, 1904, under the auspices of the African Union First Colored\r\nMethodist Protestant Church in America and Canada, with five members\r\nand Rev. Edward Nicholas as pastor. The church and Sunday School has\r\nat present a total membership of eighty-eight.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. Nicholas was assigned to this field of labor by the\r\nninetieth annual conference of the above named denomination, held at\r\nthe mother church in Wilmington, Delaware County, May 18, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the place have done much to encourage this well\r\nbegun work.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nChester Lodge No. 363, Knights of Pythias, was organized in the year\r\n1894, and the lodge charter is dated July 25 of that year. The lodge\r\nwas started with a membership of twenty-one, which has increased to\r\nforty Knights. The lodge conventions are held every Thursday evening\r\nat Castle Hall, in the Wilkin building. The sums paid to members in\r\nsick benefits since the organization amount to $1,000.\r\n\r\nStandard Lodge No. 711, F. & A. M., was instituted July 27, 1871, and\r\ncontinued to meet in this place, where many of its members resided\r\nuntil a few years ago, when a majority decided to change its place of\r\nmeeting to Monroe.\r\n\r\nThe Chester National Bank was organized in the year 1845 as a State\r\nbank, and became a national bank on June 6, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe bank occupies the up-to-date quarters in its new building,\r\nerected in 1896, on Main street. The building is of brick, with\r\nQuincy granite facing, built at a cost of $10,000, its fire and\r\nburglar-proof vault containing 100 safe-deposit boxes, at an added\r\ncost of $8,000.\r\n\r\nChester free library, organized through the effort of Chester Library\r\nand Social Club, was chartered by the University of the State of New\r\nYork, December 19, 1901. The original trustees were Hiram Tuthill,\r\npresident; Charles W. Kerner, secretary and treasurer; Joseph Board,\r\nJoseph Durland and Roswell W. Chamberlain, trustees. Mrs. Abbie\r\nMasters is librarian. The library owns about 800 volumes, and in 1907\r\ncirculated 3,543 books. It is supported by voluntary contributions\r\nand entertainments. The reading room, which is well supplied with\r\nperiodicals and the library, are open to the public on Tuesday,\r\nThursday and Saturday evening's and Saturday afternoons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joseph Durland]\r\n\r\nThe Young Men's Christian Association was organized March 1, 1907,\r\nwith 110 members. The members occupy the rooms in the Lawrence\r\nbuilding. The society started in a very flourishing condition.\r\n\r\nThere have been various organizations from time to time in Chester\r\nto advance its interests. The Board of Trade was organized October 1,\r\n1900, with Frank Durland, president; W. A. Lawrence, vice-president;\r\nCharles W. Kerner, secretary; Hiram Tuthill, treasurer. Directors,\r\nJoseph Board, William Osborne, George Vail, G. M. Roe.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade represents the spirit that has effected\r\nco-operation in many ways for advancing the interests of the town.\r\nAmong them are the incorporation of our village and the securing of\r\nthe water supply from Walton Lake, and the Telford streets. At\r\npresent the officers are looking forward to the development of the\r\nsuburban idea on the beautiful site that our village affords, and\r\nwill welcome desirable manufacturing interests.\r\n\r\nFrom a small beginning in the year 1874, the manufacture of\r\nNeufchatel and square cream cheese has grown until at the present\r\ntime the Lawrence & Son's cheese factory is using over 300 cans or\r\n12,000 quarts of milk daily, employing a daily average of twenty-five\r\nmen. This factory, consuming such a large amount of milk, together\r\nwith Borden's large receiving station, with a receiving average of\r\n100 cans daily, proves the high productiveness of the land in this\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nThe Sugar Milk factory is located adjoining this cheese plant for the\r\nmanufacture of milk sugar.\r\n\r\nThis sugar is made from the whey, a by-product delivered by the\r\ncheese factory.\r\n\r\nMILITARY.\r\n\r\nThe military record of Chester is a worthy one. Quite a number of\r\nChester residents made up a company during the Revolutionary War,\r\nunder Colonel Allison, and were attached to the Goshen regiment.\r\n\r\nIn the second war with England there was a representation of hardy\r\nmen of this town to endure the hardships of the war. Some of them\r\nsurvived until the year 1880.\r\n\r\nDuring the general training days that followed the second war with\r\nEngland, Captain John Yelverton, whose sword is still prized as a\r\nrelic of those days of patriotic zeal, led the men of the town to\r\nDurland's Square, where the volunteer militia were inspected.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War nearly 200 men represented this town in\r\ndefending the Union. Many of them suffered upon the battlefield. A\r\nfew citizens from the young men of the town enlisted in the Spanish\r\nAmerican War.\r\n\r\nSUGAR LOAF.\r\n\r\nSugar Loaf is one of the oldest communities of Orange County and as\r\na trading center was established shortly after the settlement of\r\nGoshen.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the villages of Chester township to which we may look\r\nwith interest in these early times. It was named by these pioneer\r\nsettlers from the cone-like mountain which towers above the quiet\r\nvillage to an elevation of 1,226 feet above sea level. The mountain,\r\nwhich consists mostly of greywacke slate, resembles in appearance, as\r\nviewed from the village, a loaf of sugar, such as was used in the\r\nhomes of the early settlers before the day of granulated sugar as an\r\narticle of commerce. This sublime eminence, the highest in the\r\ncounty, affords from its summit one of the most commanding views in\r\nthe county. This view is best secured by entering the field near\r\nGeorge H. Mapes's place on the road to Sugar Loaf Valley and walking,\r\nas it were, from the tail to the head of the lion-like mountain, for\r\nthis is the shape of the mountain as viewed from Chester depot.\r\n\r\nN. P. Willis, the American poet and literary genius, who loved old\r\nOrange County's hills from Butler Hill on the Hudson, which he\r\nrenamed Storm King, to Adam and Eve in the drowned lands, speaks of\r\nSugar Loaf Mountain when viewed from the Chester Hills as being like\r\na crouching lion ready to spring upon its prey.\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of inhabitants includes Hugh Dobbin, who lived\r\nnear Sugar Loaf Mountain in 1738. Mr. Perry lived near the pond,\r\nwhich bore his name and later was called Wickham Pond. This was\r\nprior to the middle of the eighteenth century, when Clinton, the\r\nsurveyor, marked the Chesekook claim line, which extended from the\r\nbase of Goose Pond Mountain to Bellevale and thence to the Jersey\r\nline.\r\n\r\nStephen W. Perry, who lived in the Sugar Loaf Valley a century ago,\r\nwas probably related to the Perry with whom the surveyors stopped in\r\nthose Colonial days when the Indians still lived in the mountains and\r\nthe surveyors were accustomed to use the Indian wigwams for shelter\r\nduring their journey, blazing the trees on the Chesekook line\r\nthrough the trackless forest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fred B. Seely]\r\n\r\nNathaniel Knapp lived for a time on the Levi Geer place, and a\r\nheadstone with the date 1804, the initials N. K., aged sixty-four\r\nyears, marks the place of his burial. For some sentimental reason he\r\nwas buried under a great oak on the farm upon which Hugh Dobbin\r\nprobably lived in the year 1738. According to tradition the old log\r\nhouse of this early pioneer was at the curve of the road near the\r\nentrance to the meadow. Among other men that have been prominent\r\nabout Sugar Loaf were Henry Wisner, Horace Ketchum, Squire James\r\nHallock, Jesse H. Knapp, Vincent Wood, who lived on the Asa Dolson\r\nfarm, and John Holbert, born 1773, who lived on the farm now\r\noccupied by his grandson, Samuel Holbert.\r\n\r\nThe Knapp family came from Connecticut, and settled on three\r\ndifferent farms. Some of the family emigrated later through a\r\ntrackless forest to the Butternut Creek in Otsego County.\r\n\r\nThe Nicholas Demerest family, of Chester, descended from James\r\nDemerest's family, who came from Bergen County, New Jersey, and\r\nsettled on the ridge near Sugar Loaf, occupying a farm of five\r\nhundred acres. John Bigger is mentioned by John Wood, the assessor,\r\nin 1775, as a taxpayer, together with David Rumsey, Samuel Wickham,\r\nJacobus Bertholf and Barnabas Horton.\r\n\r\nIn Sugar Loaf Valley, east of the mountain, John King settled soon\r\nafter his marriage in 1784, upon a farm of two hundred acres. Among\r\nhis neighbors were Cornelius Board and George Davis. Thomas\r\nFitzgerald lived near the line of the town of Warwick. More recently\r\nin the community life of Sugar Loaf the following men may be\r\nmentioned: Joseph Cooper, Crinis Laroe, David Dyer, Lewis Rhodes,\r\nJesse Wood, John D. Conklin, John Bertholf, Silas Rose, David W.\r\nStevens, Charles Fitzgerald and Elisha Stevens.\r\n\r\nMiss Martha Odell, of Chester, now ninety-four years of age,\r\nremembers the visits of \"Frank Forrester\" and his companion, \"Tom\r\nDraw,\" passing through the village and over the hills to the valley\r\nand beyond for game and fish.\r\n\r\nThe school of Sugar Loaf village in the past century has educated\r\nmany bright boys and girls. The old school-house stood on the road\r\nthat leads from the village to the northwest. The house was on the\r\nwesterly side of the road. Reeder Feagles and Lieutenant Wood were\r\namong the teachers in the early part of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe fact that men with patriotic zeal have been identified with\r\nSugar Loaf may be summarized by the statement that in the home of\r\nMrs. H. C. Baker are mementos of her husband's service in the Civil\r\nWar, Jesse H. Knapp, who was an officer in the second war with\r\nEngland, and Caleb Knapp, who served in the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Safety during the Revolutionary War included other\r\npatriots like Jacobus and Gillion Bertholf, David Rumsey, father of\r\nRoyal Rumsey, and Captain Henry Wisner. Jacob, John and Josiah\r\nFeagles were patriotic citizens of this section during these times.\r\n\r\nThe interesting story is told of Hugh Dobbin, the pioneer of Sugar\r\nLoaf, that during the Revolution he was exempt from service, but\r\npointed with pride to the fact that in 1757, in the struggle with\r\nthe French and Indians, he assisted the Government by pasturing one\r\nhundred and fifteen horses belonging to Captain John Wisner's\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nWe cannot turn from the story of this section without alluding to\r\nthe loss of one of its interesting objects, now only a tradition. Mr.\r\nThomas Burt, of Warwick, at the age of eighty-seven, remembers the\r\ntime when on the side of Sugar Loaf Mountain there was an eminence\r\nupon which was the profile of a man with broad shoulders, narrow neck\r\nand enlarged head with hat on. This was called the \"Old Giant,\" and\r\nnear it was a fissure in the rock called the \"Giant's Cellar.\"\r\nTradition says that Claudius Smith, after his depredations through\r\nthe county, hid in this cleft of the rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George E. Brink.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF CORNWALL.\r\n\r\nBy E. M. V. McClean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first view of Cornwall is not attractive. Two rugged hills rise\r\nbefore us, their sides not even clothed with virgin soil, for the\r\nloose soil sends down sand and boulders to the street below. They are\r\nseparated by a rocky ravine, at the bottom of which runs a brook,\r\nscarcely visible in summer's drought, but fed in the spring by the\r\nmelting snow from the hills, becomes a torrent that sweeps away\r\nbridges and roads that form its banks. A narrow highway has been cut\r\nat the base of each hill, but merges into one road just where the\r\nstream is spanned by a pretty stone bridge.\r\n\r\nThe landing itself is simply a business place without any pretense of\r\nbeauty. Nathan Clark's store stands as it did in 1824. Some small\r\nhouses shelter a few families, storehouses line the docks. Taft,\r\nHowell & Company's mill has only the attractiveness of utility if we\r\nexcept the emerald velvet robe of Ampelopsis, which almost covers the\r\nentire front. The West Shore depot is a more modern structure and\r\npast this the black rails sweep north and south.\r\n\r\nWe will take the right hand road past the post-office, presided over\r\nby Miss Young, and ascend a rather steep hill. After we leave the\r\nlittle bridge we are shut out from the sight of civilization. At our\r\nright rises an almost perpendicular hill darkly clothed in fir, pine\r\nand hemlock. On the left is a substantial hand rail protecting us\r\nfrom the rocky gorge below. It is cool and dark here and we will stay\r\nlong enough to review a little of Cornwall's early history.\r\n\r\nAs the _Half Moon_ anchored in the broad bay south of Newburgh, the\r\nswift canoes of the Indians shot out from the shore to investigate\r\nwhat kind of a bird their white winged visitors might be. They were\r\nof the tribe Warwaronecks, afterwards known as the Murderer's Kill\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1685, Governor Dongan purchased the tract claimed by\r\nthis tribe, extending from Murderer's Creek to Stony Point, the river\r\nforming the eastern boundary. A year previous to this a Scotchman\r\nnamed McGregorie had brought his own and several families to settle\r\nhere. A document is extant in which Margaret McGregorie states:\r\n\r\n\"They were not only the first Christians that had settled thereon but\r\nalso peaceably and quietly and enjoyed their land during the term of\r\ntheir natural lives.\"\r\n\r\nMcGregorie was placed in command of the militia and marched with his\r\nmen to fight the Indians. Before he left he was assured by Governor\r\nDongan the patent for his land should be issued. It never was. He was\r\nkilled in 1691 and during the trouble with the Leisler government and\r\nthat of Governor Fletcher his property was sold to Captain Evans.\r\nAfter a great deal of trouble in getting back to his family, who held\r\nit until 1727, it was sold to Thomas Ellison.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of the names of any of his family after his death\r\nexcept his and that of his wife's brother Tosusk, the Laird of\r\nMinnevard. The boundaries of this tract were very indefinite until in\r\n1799 when Monroe and Blooming Grove were erected into separate towns.\r\nButtermilk Falls still formed part of our territory, but the mountain\r\nmade business intercourse so very inconvenient that in 1872 a\r\npetition was granted by the Legislature severing this connection,\r\nthe new village taking the name of Highland Falls.\r\n\r\nFREIGHTING.\r\n\r\nThere were still many hundred acres and those were divided into large\r\nfarms where cattle, horses and small stock were raised in great\r\nquantities. Orange County milk and butter had become famous and\r\nCornwall contributed her full share. Not only the products of our\r\nown neighborhood but those of the other counties reached New York by\r\nthe way of Cornwall landing. A friend recently gone from us, Miss\r\nMaria Conser, who was a child at that time, gives the following\r\ngraphic description: \"How we children liked to stop on our way to the\r\nold schoolhouse to watch the loaded wagons drawn by three mules\r\nabreast lumbering over the rough roads. We were frightened when we\r\nmet the droves of cattle. The tossing of their wild horns sent us\r\nscrambling upon the stone wall until they had passed. Hours would\r\nelapse while tubs of butter, forests of hoop-poles, cows, calves,\r\nsheep and lambs were placed on board of the night boat. The\r\npassengers went to their berths but alas, for their hope of rest; the\r\nlowing of cattle, the bleating of lambs and the noise of the crew\r\nforbade sleep. About midnight a lull would come; the boat gliding\r\nthrough the softly murmuring water made sleep possible.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles Ketcham.]\r\n\r\nIn 1805 Isaac Tobias constructed a dock at New Windsor where he built\r\nthe sloop _Hector_ and sailed it from the landing. A few years later\r\nCaptain Nathaniel Ketchum ran the _Revenge_ between here and the\r\ncity. In 1828 the _Experiment,_ the first steamboat that sailed from\r\nthe landing, was built by Silas Corwin of New Windsor and commanded\r\nby Captain Isaac Vanduzer. She had four smokestacks and was but\r\nlittle more speedy than the sloops. After a few years she was sold to\r\nWeeks & Griffin who in turn disposed of her to Bertholf & Co. She was\r\nfinally converted into a barge. Two others, the _Wave_ and _General\r\nJackson,_ were put on, and in 1855 Captain Joseph Ketchum and Henry\r\nM. Clark purchased the _Orange County_ and ran her between here and\r\nNew York. The building of the Erie Railroad to Piermont sent a large\r\npart of the freight by that route and we have never recovered our\r\nlost prestige. But just about this time a new industry sprang up\r\nwhich partially made up for the freight that had been carried\r\nelsewhere. The land was found to be especially adapted to the\r\nraising of small fruits--the Hudson River Antwerp raspberries and\r\nstrawberries being the most successful, and thousands were shipped\r\nevery night during the fruit season. This too fell off when it was\r\ndiscovered that we had a home market for all we could raise. This\r\nwas due to the personality of one man, N. P. Willis.\r\n\r\nIDLEWILD.\r\n\r\nThose who visit Idlewild today and note the miles of gravel walk\r\nsweeping where the vista that opens is most beautiful: the rare trees\r\nbrought from many lands--the acres of lawn, smooth as velvet--the\r\nprofusion of flowers that meets one at every turn--the luxurious\r\nmansion crowned to its eaves with blossoms and vines, can hardly\r\nrealize the wild grandeur of the scene that appealed to the poet soul\r\nof N. P. Willis, and drew from the owner, Mr. Daniel Ward, the\r\nquestion, \"What do you want with such an idle wild?\"\r\n\r\nAn unbroken woodland lying about the bank of the river, whose\r\nromantic beauty was as yet unappreciated; bisected by a dark ravine\r\nat the bottom of which ran a brook only revealed by the music of its\r\nwaters and thrown into spray by huge boulders obstructing its course.\r\nPines, hemlocks and forest trees centuries old sprang towards the\r\nsunlight but at their base grew impenetrable underbrush.\r\n\r\nThe name has become a household word not only among our own people,\r\nbut in the lands beyond the sea, and thousands of readers followed\r\nwith delight every step that was taken to change the scene from\r\nbarbarism to civilization. \"A letter from Idlewild\" was published\r\nevery week in the _Home Journal_ of which Willis and George P.\r\nMorris were editors.\r\n\r\nWhile still a boy in college the publication of his Scriptural poems\r\nattracted much attention. These were followed by \"Pencilings by the\r\nWay,\" a brilliant record of a trip through Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 he was sent to Cornwall by his physician in hopes of\r\nprolonging his life. He was threatened with consumption and had\r\nalready been warned by the danger signal of several hemorrhages. The\r\nmedicine prescribed was rest, nourishment and every hour possible\r\nspent out of doors. He boarded with a gentle Quaker lady, Mrs.\r\nSoutherland, over whose home the dove of Peace was brooding. Slowly\r\nbut sometimes almost imperceptibly came returning strength, but to\r\nmake it permanent he must remain here and so came the purchase of a\r\nhome. The Civil War brought financial reverses, for a majority of his\r\nsubscribers were in The South, but he turned again to work in order\r\nto recoup some of his losses, but his health again broke down and he\r\ndied on his 60th birthday, 1867, in the home he loved so well.\r\n\r\nMr. Willis was twice married--first to a sweet-faced English girl,\r\nwho only lived for a few years. His second wife was Miss Cornelia\r\nGrinnell, daughter of one of our merchant princes. She sold the\r\nestate, which passed into the hands of Judge George, a gentleman of\r\nculture and refined taste, who carried out many of the improvements\r\nplanned by his predecessor. He sold it to the late Mr. Courtney, who\r\nwas then President of the West Shore Railroad. After Mr. Courtney's\r\ndeath it passed into the hands of Mr. Charles Curie, the present\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Willis's \"letters from an invalid,\" he described the beautiful\r\nwalks and drives in the neighborhood where he spent his days and the\r\ndescription brought summer visitors seeking for board. Every room was\r\noccupied and hundreds went away for lack of accommodation. The next\r\nseason saw new houses built and others were enlarged, and there\r\nseemed no limit to our prosperity. A paper published here in 1874\r\ncontained the advertisements of twenty-five houses that were public\r\nboarding-houses, besides all that were accommodated in private\r\nfamilies. Many who came as visitors purchased building sites and\r\nerected summer homes. One of these was Mr. Harvey, of Brooklyn, who\r\nbuilt Homeland, adjoining Idlewild. Mr. E. A. Mattheissen secured the\r\nnext site where Mattheissen Park is now. Mr. Solomon, of New York,\r\nchose Land's End for his beautiful home. Mr. Bellows's residence was\r\non Bayview Avenue. Mr. James Stillman and his mother each have a\r\nsummer cottage here.\r\n\r\nBOARDING-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nAmong all the houses opened for guests the Mountain House stood\r\nfirst, from the fact of its position twelve hundred feet above\r\ntide-water in the heart of pine woods, where the visitors found\r\nhealth as well as recreation. The building itself was also\r\nattractive. In the early sixties Dr. Champlin, who had been traveling\r\nin the East, saw some marvelous cures performed on consumptive\r\npatients by the use of kourmis.\r\n\r\nProperty on the mountain was at this time nearly all held by two\r\nfamilies--John Losee Wood and Christian Vought; so when the doctor\r\nerected two houses as a sanitarium, no one objected. The architecture\r\nwas oriental--windows and doors were surmounted by round arches, and\r\nthe second story was built over the broad piazza which surrounded it\r\non three sides. A number of goats were installed in what is now the\r\nChalet across the road, and two physicians, Doctors Pellatier and\r\nBoyd, had charge of the houses, but the enterprise was a failure and\r\nit became a boarding-house, numbering among its patrons some of the\r\nmost exclusive families of New York and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMany of the wealthier guests who saw that there was a possibility of\r\nforming a colony similar to that of Tuxedo, joined in a syndicate to\r\npurchase land, to lay out roads and develop its resources. Later it\r\nwas found desirable to have a place of meeting for themselves, and\r\nthe clubhouse was built. It was incorporated under the title of the\r\nDeer Hill Company in 1890. Besides being able to accommodate many\r\nguests cottages were built in the grounds and the Mountain House\r\nfound its days of prosperity gone. Mr. J. W. Meagher surrendered his\r\nlease and fire destroyed two-thirds of the building, when it passed\r\ninto the hands of Mr. James Stillman. One of the next houses in\r\npoint of numbers was Mr. James G. Roe's. It has sheltered three\r\nhundred guests. The Elmer, had nearly two hundred; the Smith was\r\nalmost the length of a city block. The Wiley House had ninety feet of\r\nbroad piazzas. Grand View, owned by Mrs. Alott, is the only one at\r\npresent that is still in the business. There were many others, and\r\nnearly every private family was willing to accommodate city guests.\r\nRecently the club has surrendered its charter, and it has passed into\r\nprivate hands.\r\n\r\nROUND TOP.\r\n\r\nWhile we are in the mountain we will stand for a few minutes on\r\nRound Top, the home of the late Miss Hussey. Near us is a small\r\nchalet, consisting of three rooms with a cedar rail portico in front.\r\nHere for sixty years a woman, refined, cultured, and of marked\r\nliterary ability, dwelt alone. There came a break in her seclusion,\r\nwhen in 1861 she entered the army as a nurse, where she remained\r\nuntil the close of the war. She was a fine raconteur, and many a\r\nstory of those days entertained her visitors, and she had many, for\r\nshe and her romantic home attracted nearly everyone who came to\r\nCornwall. She kept a visitors' book, and there were 5,000 names in it\r\nbefore mine. In 1876 she, with two other ladies, Miss McClean and\r\nMiss Hayes, edited the first newspaper printed in the town, but it\r\nwas not a success after the first year, when she abandoned it. She\r\nreceived a pension from the Government, and died about four years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nE. P. ROE.\r\n\r\nAs we have been dealing with personal history, a modest residence\r\nwith large grounds suggests another name, that of E. P. Roe, the\r\nnovelist. His childhood was passed in Moodna and the home and\r\nsurrounding scenery in the background of the picture drawn in\r\n\"Nature's Serial Story.\" He studied in Williams College and then\r\nentered a theological seminary, but in 1862 resigned to become\r\nchaplain in the Harris Light Cavalry. He participated in several\r\nengagements, but on being appointed Hospital Chaplain, was granted a\r\nfurlough, came home and was married to Miss Sands, who accompanied\r\nhim back to the seat of war. He retained his position until the close\r\nof hostilities, when he took charge of the Presbyterian Church at\r\nHighland Falls. He visited Chicago after the fire, and that suggested\r\nthe plot of \"Barriers Burned Away.\" The success of this was\r\nphenomenal, several editions following in quick succession. Feeling\r\nhe could reach a larger congregation by his pen than by his voice,\r\nhe resigned his charge and came to Cornwall. His mornings were spent\r\nin his garden, where his success in fruit raising equaled that in\r\nliterary work. The afternoons in his study resulted in volume after\r\nvolume being given to the public in quick succession. His books sold\r\nwell and his royalties were large, but through the misfortunes of\r\nothers he became financially embarrassed and sold the royalties of\r\nhis then published novels for $30,000. He still found ready sale for\r\nall he produced, which soon enabled him to liquidate his obligation,\r\nand the \"children of his fancy were his own again.\" But the strain\r\ntold on him, and in 1887 he went to Santa Barbara for rest and\r\nrecuperation. There he wrote \"The Earth Trembled,\" a story of the\r\nCharleston earthquake. He returned in 1887 and began his last work,\r\n\"Miss Lou,\" which was never finished. In August, 1888, he was\r\nreading aloud in his library, when he was seized with sharp pains in\r\nhis heart. Two physicians were summoned, but failed to give relief\r\nand half an hour after his first attack, E. P. Roe was no more. After\r\nhis death several gentlemen, among others Mr. Thomas Taft, Mr.\r\nValentine and the Rev. Lyman Abbott, consulted as to what shape a\r\npermanent memorial to him would take. A Roe Memorial Park was decided\r\nupon, the location being near his home on the side of Round Top,\r\nbounded by the Boulevard. It consists of a little more than two acres\r\nand is heavily wooded. None of the trees have been disturbed, only\r\nthe underbrush cleared up and paths made through the grounds. At the\r\ntop is a large boulder and on top of this was placed a bronze tablet,\r\non which was engraved two branches of chestnuts with their foliage\r\nand burrs, some open. Above this is inscribed: \"In Memory of Edward\r\nPayson Roe,\" and under this, \"Near to Nature's Heart.\" The tablet was\r\nunveiled on May 30, 1894, with very impressive ceremonies and was\r\npresented to the village.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL DUNCAN.\r\n\r\nAnother name very dear to Cornwall, but one almost forgotten by the\r\npresent generation, was that of Colonel James Duncan. He was born at\r\nCold Springs, but his parents moved here when he was a small boy, and\r\nsettled on a farm a little out of the village. He graduated from West\r\nPoint in 1835, and was appointed Lieutenant of the Fourth Cavalry. In\r\n1838 he perfected an arm of the service called \"The flying\r\nartillery,\" and this first brought him into notice. During the\r\nMexican War he rose from the rank of Lieutenant to that of Colonel.\r\nHe received the appointment of Inspector General of the United States\r\nArmy, and during one of his visitations at Mobile he contracted the\r\nyellow fever and died there in 1849. His body was brought on and\r\nburied near his home, but some years later it was removed to the\r\ncemetery at West Point.\r\n\r\nCANTERBURY.\r\n\r\nThat part of the town known as Canterbury was probably the first\r\nportion settled. Old records give names of path masters who resided\r\nhere previous to the Revolutionary War, but seemed to have left no\r\ndescendants. As far back as 1820 we have the name of John Chadeayne,\r\none of whose sons, Mr. Henry F. Chadeayne, was the father of our\r\npresent supervisor. The early physicians all located in that end of\r\nthe town. Dr. Tobias was the first one of which we have any record.\r\nDr. Clinton came next, and then Dr. Elisha Hedges, dying a young man\r\nin 1824. The house where he lived was occupied until recently by his\r\ndaughter. His successors were Dr. Heaton and his son-in-law, Dr.\r\nGough, and they cared for all the sick in the radius of many miles.\r\nBut as the population increased there was found work for others, and\r\nDr. Beattie came to us and died among us in his eightieth year. Dr.\r\nThomas Heaton also lies in one of our cemeteries, one of the most\r\nbeloved and trusted of doctors. He was a grandson of the first one\r\nof that name. Dr. Hotchkiss represented homeopathy, and at his death\r\nwas succeeded by Dr. Bergen, to be followed by Dr. Chandler of that\r\ncult. Beside the latter we have Drs. Winter and Bowdish, of the\r\nupper village, and Drs. Shirk and Bayard, of the lower one, at\r\npresent with us.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\n_Presbyterian._--The earliest record of religious worship came from\r\nBethlehem, which was at first the name of the church, and then\r\nextended to the neighborhood. It was Presbyterian in form and\r\nministered to by the Rev. Mr. Challoner, who had charge also in\r\nCornwall, New Windsor and Blooming Grove. The building was erected in\r\n1730. In point of seniority it was the third oldest congregation west\r\nof the Hudson and north of the Highlands. The second incumbent was\r\nthe Rev. Enos Ayres, who was followed by Mr. Close in 1764. He\r\nremained for forty years, and was chaplain during the Revolutionary\r\nWar to soldiers stationed in the vicinity. The Rev. Artemus Dean was\r\ninstalled in 1813 and served for twenty-nine years. During his\r\npastorate the church that had stood for ninety-six years was torn\r\ndown and replaced by the present edifice. In 1872 the Rev. Mr.\r\nAtwater was appointed. In 1827 the Rev. James Thorn, of Canterbury,\r\ngathered some members of other churches together and, obtaining\r\nletters of dismissal from their several organizations, formed them\r\ninto a congregation. A small church was erected, and in 1828 he was\r\ninstalled by the Presbytery of the North River as pastor for New\r\nWindsor and Canterbury. He was succeeded in 1835 by Jonathan\r\nSilliman, who remained pastor for twenty-six years. The Rev. Messrs.\r\nBaker, Eddy and Clarke succeeded each other for short terms, but in\r\n1872 the Rev. Lyman Abbott took charge. He labored faithfully for\r\nmany years, and only severed his connection when the call came from\r\nPlymouth Church, Brooklyn. His place was filled by Mr. Egbert, who\r\nproved to be a thoroughly live man, leaving the impress of his\r\npersonality not only on his church but the whole neighborhood. A call\r\nto a larger field took him away, and his mantle fell on the Rev. Mr.\r\nBeattie, who had been taught in that Sunday School. He too gave up\r\nand was succeeded by Rev. Mr. Allen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Orr.]\r\n\r\n_Cornwall-on-Hudson Presbyterian Church._--As early as 1855 some\r\nfamilies residing in what is now known as Cornwall-on-Hudson, felt\r\nthe need of a church at this place. They held their first meeting in\r\nthe school-room of Alfred C. Roe, in the building now occupied by the\r\nGold Cure, and \"depending on divine aid resolved to erect a house of\r\nWorship,\" and one year later the present building was dedicated.\r\nThere were only seventeen members and eight of them belonged to the\r\nRoe family. Their names were Peter Roe, Mrs. Susan Roe, Alfred C.\r\nRoe, Mrs. Caroline Roe, James G. Roe and wife, Mrs. Roe Caldwell,\r\nMilton Wiley and wife, Mrs. Mary Jackson, Miss Amanda Adams, Mrs.\r\nMary A. Clark, Mrs. Rachael Bruen, Phebe Greegs, Mary Johnson,\r\nAngeline Clark, and John P. Roe. In 1899 there were four survivors,\r\nbut Mrs. Sarah Wiley died that year, Mr. Milton Wiley following three\r\nyears later. In 1906 Mrs. Mary Jackson passed away, but was able to\r\nbe present part of the time in the church at the celebration of its\r\nfiftieth anniversary. Her sister, Miss Amanda Adams, still survives.\r\n\r\nThe first elders chosen were Milton Wiley and James G. Roe, James O.\r\nAdams was elected later. The first stated supply was the Rev. Dr.\r\nDeyo, who was succeeded by the Rev. Joseph Robinson, who died in\r\n1858. Dr. Ledoux followed, who resigned when Mr. Teal was appointed.\r\nHe was called to a larger field and the Rev. George P. Noble came. In\r\n1891 he dissolved his connection with the church and Mr. Hugh\r\nFrasier, the present incumbent, was installed.\r\n\r\nThe next church in point of age is the plain Quaker meeting house in\r\nCanterbury. Previous to its erection, service was held in the house\r\noccupied by David Sands, who was a noted Friend preacher, but as the\r\ncongregation grew it was found a place of worship was needed. About\r\n1790 the present edifice was built and Catherine Sands, a girl of\r\ntwelve years old, carried the nails for the workmen from New Windsor\r\non horseback.\r\n\r\nA division in doctrine caused a separation in the society in 1827.\r\nThe part retaining the buildings was called the orthodox and the\r\nseceders Hicksites, from a member called Elias Hicks, who had\r\npromulgated the new belief. These held meetings in private houses for\r\nsome months, when a brick building was erected in the rear of what is\r\nnow John Chatfield's stable. Both Mr. Beach and Mr. Ruttenber mention\r\na coincidence in the two buildings. The first marriage in the first\r\nhouse was Catherine Sands to Squire Ring, and the first one in the\r\nnew building was that of her son, Robert Ring, nearly forty years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n_Methodist._--The early Methodists held their meetings in a\r\nschool-house, which stood for many years at the Corners, but in 1830\r\nerected the present building on a knoll in Canterbury. It has been\r\nalmost rebuilt and modernized, and now is a very handsome church. The\r\nfirst pastor was the Rev. Phineas Rice, who had charge in New\r\nWindsor, and what is now Vails Gate, Salisbury and Mountainville. In\r\n1863 it became self-supporting, and was detached from the other\r\nmissions, and the Rev. J. H. Gregory was appointed by the Conference.\r\nIt has always since had a resident pastor and the present incumbent,\r\nRev. Angelo Ostrander is justly popular and has been returned by the\r\nunanimous request of the congregation three successive terms.\r\n\r\n_Episcopal._--Previous to 1858 there was no separate organization of\r\nthe Episcopal Church in Cornwall. Those who could do so drove to New\r\nWindsor, and those who were unable, joined in the worship with other\r\nreligious bodies. Many of the strangers coming here at that time were\r\nof that faith, and in conjunction with some of the residents took the\r\nnecessary steps for the incorporation of a parish. On July 17th,\r\n1858, a meeting was held and officers were elected to serve until the\r\nfollowing Easter. Alonzo Alvord and William Bayard were chosen\r\nwardens, and N. P. Willis, Thos. Cummings, Daniel Birdsall, James\r\nCrissey, Nicholas Chatfield, Jr., Francis Barton, Chas. H. Mead and\r\nJohn Chatfield were elected vestrymen. A lot was purchased and a\r\ncontract for the building made with Messrs. Shaw & Sons, of Newburgh,\r\nand on May 10th, 1829, the corner-stone was laid by the Right Rev.\r\nDr. Potter. By the 20th of November of the same year it was opened\r\nfor divine service. Until 1864, the services were conducted by the\r\nresident minister at New Windsor, but in November of that year the\r\nRev. John Webster was installed, who was succeeded in January, 1866,\r\nby the Rev. W. G. French. In 1869. the tower and spire was completed,\r\none of our wealthy residents who was a vestryman, Mr. Sherwood,\r\ncontributing $2,000. The ladies' auxiliary, an organization that has\r\nshown the greatest success in collecting funds for church purposes,\r\ncontributed the clock. Mr. Snowden was the next minister, who died in\r\noffice. The Rev, Mr. Huntington succeeded him, and was succeeded by\r\nMr. Cleveling, who gave place to Dr. Page, who has charge at present.\r\n\r\n_The Catholic._--Previous to 1857 the members of the Catholic Church\r\nmet for service in the home of Mrs. McQuade, in Canterbury, and at\r\nthe corners in what was then known as the Weaver house. Three\r\ngentlemen, John Diffendale, Daniel O. Callahan and John McClean\r\nstarted a building fund, each contributing one hundred dollars. The\r\nnext on the list was a non-Catholic, Mr. Henry F. Chadeayne with\r\nfifty dollars. Mr. Stephen Gillis gave 50,000 bricks from his yard.\r\nBut a few weeks elapsed before there was money enough to justify\r\ntheir purpose of building a church, and a lot was purchased at the\r\ntop of River avenue, which commanded a magnificent view of mountains\r\nand river. The building was erected by Messrs. Little Brothers & Co.,\r\nof Newburgh, and would seat about 150. About twenty families\r\nrepresented the entire congregation. But only a few years elapsed\r\nwhen it was found wholly inadequate to accommodate the resident\r\npopulation, and the summer visitors would have filled one three times\r\nas large. It was supplied from St. Patrick's, Newburgh, a priest\r\ndriving down on Sunday morning, and returning after service. After\r\nA. E. Mattheissen and the Harvey and Sherwood families settled here,\r\nsteps were taken to build a larger edifice. The present lot was\r\npurchased for $1,000 and nearly $2,000 more was in the savings bank,\r\nwhen an application was made for a resident clergyman, and in 1870\r\nFather Ambrose Keogh was sent by the Archbishop of New York. His\r\nhealth was very delicate, and at first it seemed a task beyond his\r\nstrength to attempt to erect a church, but the present fine building\r\nis a monument of his perseverance and energy. The corner-stone was\r\nlaid in 1871 by Bishop McQuade, of Rochester, and the following year\r\nservices were held in the basement. A handsome rectory was built and\r\nfurnished at the same time. It was connected with a mission at\r\nWashingtonville. After five years' service Father Keogh was\r\ntransferred to Tuckahoe, and was succeeded by Father Mackin. There\r\nwas a mortgage of $13,000 on the property and Cornwall prosperity had\r\nbegun to wane, and the churches were among the first to feel it.\r\nMeeting the annual interest and current expenses were nearly all\r\nthat was attempted at that time, with the exception of the purchase\r\nof a cemetery for $2,000. At the end of five years Father Ward\r\nsucceeded to the pastorate, and immediately took steps to complete\r\nthe upper part. This he did, at a cost of about $8,000, without\r\nincreasing the mortgage. He was succeeded by Father Gordon, who paid\r\n$8,000 of the debt during the five years of his incumbency. His\r\npromotion to a large city parish was followed by the Rev. Phillip\r\nAhearn, who was in turn succeeded by the Rev. James Curry. A heating\r\nplant, electric light and village water were installed at this time\r\ninto both church and rectory. Two handsome side altars were built\r\nwith three costly statues. In 1901 he was appointed to St. James'\r\nParish, New York, and was succeeded by the Rev. James S. Fenton.\r\nUnder his management the remainder of the mortgage has been paid and\r\nplans drawn for a parochial school to be erected on the grounds in\r\nthe rear of the church. A large Sunday school has always been an\r\nimportant part of the work. In 1907 Father Fenton went abroad for his\r\nhealth, and the Rev. Father Brosan has charge.\r\n\r\nFIRE PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1830 means were taken for fire protection in Canterbury,\r\nand each man who contributed $2.50 could become a member. The names\r\nof the first trustees were Nathan Westcott, Elias Hand, W. T. Cocks,\r\nGeo. Marriott and John M Gough. Soon others joined it, and it was\r\ncreated a body corporate under the name of the Canterbury Fire\r\nCompany. A hand engine was purchased at an expense of $125. About\r\n1836 a second-hand suction engine was purchased in New York, but as\r\nthe population increased they realized how important it would be to\r\ncheck any serious conflagration, so in October, 1869, a meeting of\r\nproperty owners was held, which made arrangements for purchasing a\r\nlot and engine house. A committee was appointed who finally bought\r\nthe premises where Hunter & McClean had their market for $2,000. A\r\nnew engine was bought and called Highland Engine No. 1. During 1905 a\r\nvery tasteful brick building costing $5,000 was erected. There were\r\nsixty members in good standing and many applications for membership\r\nwhen a vacancy occurs. The same year, 1869, that the engine was\r\npurchased in Canterbury, a similar project was started at the\r\nCorners, and a subscription paper was sent out, but failed to get\r\nany definite pledges, each person approached being unwilling to be\r\nthe first to sign. A public meeting was called, and thirty-five\r\nyoung men responded, each promising to give five dollars. In a few\r\ndays nearly $700 was secured, and Messrs. Titus, Wiley and John\r\nMcClean went to New York to see what could be obtained for their\r\nmoney. Steamers had been introduced into the New York and Brooklyn\r\ndistricts, so they found an article that suited them in Engine\r\nGoodwill 4 of Brooklyn and it was bought and shipped on the _Orange\r\nCounty_ for Cornwall. They had no house, but procured the use of\r\nCarswell's barn. A company had been organized with Wm. J. Quigley,\r\nforeman, John K. Oliver, assistant and John McClean, Jr., secretary.\r\nA charter was procured in 1870, March 30th, in which A. E.\r\nMattheissen, Stephen Gillis, Hamilton Salmon, David Clark, Jas.\r\nHitchcock and E. H. Champlin, constituting themselves a body\r\ncorporate, under the name of the Storm King Engine No. 2. Another\r\nsubscription was solicited, which met with such a generous response\r\nthat a lot was purchased and a two-story building erected on Duncan\r\navenue. The dues of members supplemented by entertainments, furnished\r\ntheir rooms and met their expenses, but in 1900 they surrendered\r\ntheir charter to the village corporation and were henceforth a public\r\ncharge. A lot was bought on Main street and a handsome building\r\ncosting $6,000 was erected. They have a reception room, pool room,\r\nand public meeting room, and a large space down stairs for their\r\nengine house. Their charter allows only sixty members, and there are\r\nalways candidates waiting for any vacancy. A company was organized at\r\nthe Landing and some hundred feet of hose purchased, but it soon\r\ndisbanded. Last year a hose company was formed on the heights for\r\nfire protection.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nPublic schools were established soon after the Revolutionary War, and\r\neach village had its schoolhouse and teacher, for at least the winter\r\nmonths, and as the instruction was confined to the three R's several\r\nprivate schools were started, but were only moderately successful.\r\nThe earliest of these was that of Madame Rutkai, the sister of the\r\nfamous Hungarian, Louis Kossuth. Mr. Alfred Roe taught one in\r\nCanterbury for a time and in the spring of 1853 purchased the Fowler\r\nGriggs property, where he conducted a boarding and day school for\r\nyoung men. It was very successful, but in 1863 he gave it up,\r\nentered the ministry and joined the army as the chaplain of the\r\nEighty-third Volunteers. In 1877 he again came to Cornwall and opened\r\na school for young ladies, following the Harvard standard, but the\r\npatronage did not warrant its continuance and it was closed in the\r\nthird year. Dr. Ledoux succeeded in founding a permanent institution.\r\nWhile he was pastor of the Presbyterian Church, he was taken very\r\nsick with typhoid fever, and at times was delirious, and then spoke\r\nonly French, it being his native language. Mr. McCreery, the New York\r\nmerchant, who was boarding in the neighborhood, was looking for a\r\nschool for his sons, and after the Doctor's recovery arranged with\r\nhim to receive his boys into his family. He soon had as many as he\r\ncould teach, resigned his living, purchased a tract of land on the\r\nHeights, and began a most successful career. He sold out to Mr. Cobb,\r\nwho after a few years sold in turn to the present proprietor, Rev.\r\nCharles Stone.\r\n\r\nDown to 1869 our public school was taught just long enough every year\r\nto obtain the public money, and then some one would continue it as a\r\nprivate enterprise for three or four months. But in that year, some\r\nof our summer residents, including E. A. Mattheissen, Chas. Bellows,\r\nMr. Solomon, Stephen C. Gillis, James Dunn, Mr. Hitchcock, James\r\nCouser, John McKibben and Dr. Vail, formed a board of education. A\r\nlot was purchased from Mr. Hitchcock near the Corners, and a\r\nsubstantial building erected. The school was opened on May 24th,\r\n1869, with Mr. Williamson as principal, Miss McClean and Miss Frances\r\nMarvel as assistants. There were then about 80 pupils. In 1896 it was\r\nfound an addition was needed and a large building was erected across\r\nthe front at a cost of $8,000. There are fourteen teachers in the\r\nbuilding now, and one in the annex on the Heights, and the census of\r\nthis year shows 500 children of school age. The training school under\r\nMr. Aldrich, turns out wonderful work for boys and girls, and the\r\nsewing class in charge of Miss Murray, which has only been\r\nestablished a year, shows how little hands can be trained. The\r\npresent board of education consists of Mr. Townsend D. Wood,\r\npresident; Mr. P. Bevins, J. J. Hall, Louis Velton, Carlos H.\r\nStone, George Mailler, Jas. H. Ward, John Noe, and Harris Cox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas Taft.]\r\n\r\nVILLAGE OF CORNWALL-ON-HUDSON.\r\n\r\nThe village of Cornwall-on-Hudson was incorporated in March, 1885,\r\nthe first officers being: Thos. Taft, president; trustees: Wm.\r\nFogarty, Charles W. Clark and Oren Cobb; treasurer, H. N. Clark;\r\ncollector, Charles E. Cocks, and clerk, Daniel E. Pope.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 an excise board was elected, that refused to grant licenses,\r\nand since then the town has remained dry. Two reservoirs were built\r\non the mountain, and the pure spring water carried through the town.\r\nThe outlay was $67,000, but at present the water rents defray all\r\nexpenses for interest. In 1906 a proposition was made to unite the\r\ntwo villages of Canterbury and Cornwall, but was defeated. The\r\npresent board of trustees are: John Clarkson, president; Louis\r\nVelton, Charles Smith, Norman Chatfield and Ralph Quackenbush; clerk,\r\nJames H. Ward; collector, John Noe.\r\n\r\nCANTERBURY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nA small building on one of the side roads was used for many years,\r\nafter it was evident the days of its usefulness as a schoolhouse was\r\nover. In 1905 the people voted to raise $30,000 for a new\r\nschoolhouse. A lot on Willow avenue was purchased, and a building,\r\ncomplete in all modern appliances has been the result. There are\r\ntwelve teachers under a most efficient principal, Mr. Woodworth.\r\nBoth this and the one at the Corners, are high schools under the\r\nregents.\r\n\r\nVILLAGE IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThe Village Improvement Society was organized in 1900, when a public\r\nmeeting was called in Mattheissen Hall. Dr. Harrison was chairman,\r\nand introduced the Rev. Lyman Abbott, who explained the object of the\r\nassociation, which was that each one should pledge themselves to take\r\ncare of their premises, and use their influence to abate anything\r\nthat would detract from the beauty and order of the village. Nearly\r\neveryone present agreed to become a member. The following day a\r\nmeeting was held and officers elected. Mrs. Lyman Abbott was chosen\r\npresident; Mrs. Seaman, first vice-president; Mrs. Hunter, second\r\nvice-president; Mrs. Furey, secretary; Miss Laura Currie,\r\ncorresponding secretary, and Mrs. Dr. Harrison, treasurer. A handsome\r\nloving cup was purchased to be given to the person who, in the\r\nestimation of the judges, should show the best kept garden for the\r\nyear. Anyone who should win it three years in succession would own\r\nit. Mrs. John Noe held it the first year, Mrs. Milton Couser the\r\nsecond, but the three following seasons it was held by Mrs. John Noe,\r\nwho then became its permanent possessor. Almost the first work done\r\nby the society was offering ten cents a hundred for the nests of the\r\ntent worm. Seventy-two thousand were brought in by the school\r\nchildren, with the result that while the neighboring villages lost\r\nhundreds of trees the place was free from the pests. Trash cans were\r\nplaced in different parts of the village, and thirteen hundred\r\nposters were removed from trees, fences and telegraph poles.\r\n\r\nMany friends have made generous donations; among others Mr. Weeks\r\nwho, during the past four years, has offered $50 each year as\r\ndoor-yard prizes. A boys' horticultural club has been formed, land\r\nrented and a portion assigned to each boy who owns all he raises.\r\nThe two most successful receive prizes. Enough money has been\r\nsubscribed to meet the expenses of this work for five years. The\r\nsecond year of the organization, it lost by death the efficient\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. Dr. Harrison, and last summer the loved president,\r\nMrs. Lyman Abbott, died beyond the ocean and sleeps in a little\r\nGerman graveyard. The present officers are: Mrs. Ernest Abbott,\r\npresident; Miss Cocks, vice-president; Mrs. Seaman, second\r\nvice-president; Mrs. Fleming, secretary; Miss Josephine Youngs,\r\ntreasurer, and Miss E. M. V. McClean, corresponding secretary.\r\n\r\nPAPERS.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Mr. John Lee, author of stories of the Hudson, started the\r\nCornwall _Mirror,_ but he died within the year. He was succeeded by Mr.\r\nSnelling, who changed the name to the Cornwall _Reflector._ Mr. Pendell\r\nsucceeded him as editor, when the title was changed to Cornwall\r\n_Local,_ the name which it retained when it passed into the hands of\r\nthe present proprietor, Mr. Goodenough. Three or four efforts have\r\nbeen made to run a second village paper, but they have all proved a\r\nfailure. Mr. Morehouse started the _Courier,_ which passed into the\r\nhands of Creswell McLaughlin but it came to grief. It was\r\nresuscitated in 1905, but only lived a year.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the mountain water into the village, it was\r\nhoped that with the fine freighting facilities, manufacturers might\r\nbe induced to settle here, but such has not been the case. Several\r\napplications have been received from outsiders, but when negotiations\r\nreached a certain point, they have been quietly withdrawn, and it has\r\nbeen surmised that some of the wealthier neighbors object to the\r\nclass such work would bring among them. The stream known as\r\nMurderer's Creek, and later on as the Moodna, at one time had several\r\nfactories along its banks. The late John Orr's flour mill is still in\r\nbusiness, and about a mile from Canterbury is a settlement known as\r\nFirthcliff. In 1869 Mr. Broadhead had a large woolen mill there which\r\nafter a few years, passed into the hands of an English carpet\r\ncompany. These brought many of their skilled employees with them, and\r\nthey in turn induced friends and neighbors to come out, so that one\r\ncorner of the town is an English village. The home works are in\r\nEngland, but the proprietors frequently cross the Atlantic to visit\r\ntheir factory here. Still farther down the stream are the mills of\r\nJohn Orr, at a railroad station that bears his name. A piano factory,\r\nowned by John E. Ryder has disappeared, and as the brook nears the\r\nHudson, it passes through a valley which was once filled with homes\r\nof the work people employed in the Valley Forge paper mill, owned by\r\nCarson & Ide, and the Leonard linen mill. The latter stopped during\r\nthe war, but the former under different owners produced some\r\nmaterial, until a freshet tore away bridge, dam and race and forced\r\nthe stream into another channel that left the building practically\r\nwithout water.\r\n\r\nVOLUNTEERS.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruttenber gives a list of 172 volunteers who went from here\r\nduring the Civil War, but he has omitted three names, Frederick Lamb,\r\nWm. Couser and George Chatfield. Emslie Post contains the names of\r\nsome of the surviving on its roster, and on Memorial Day they\r\ndecorate eighty graves of comrades who have passed over to the great\r\nmajority. But there are others who sleep on Southern battlefields,\r\nand still others who passed from the weary anguish of the hospitals\r\nto the \"low green tent, whose curtain never outward swings.\" Captain\r\nThomas Taft is probably the youngest surviving veteran; and among the\r\nrevered names of those \"who came not back\" stand Captain Silliman,\r\nMajor Cromwell and William Emslie, who died in Andersonville. Through\r\nthe efforts of Mr. Charles Curie, of Idlewild, a soldiers' monument\r\nhas been erected in the village.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK MILITARY ACADEMY.\r\n\r\nOne of the institutions of Cornwall is the New York Military Academy.\r\nIn the '70s it was a large boarding house, capable of accommodating\r\ntwo hundred guests. The grounds cover a large plateau, skirting a\r\nravine, and was called Glen Ridge. It was owned by Mr. James G. Roe,\r\nbrother of the novelist, who when the boarding business failed in\r\nCornwall, sold to Colonel Wright, who opened a boys' school. He was\r\nsucceeded by Mr. Jones, who has enlarged the already capacious\r\nbuildings. There are always over 100 young men and boys in the\r\ninstitution, and a large corps of capable teachers. The discipline\r\nis secured more by rewards than punishments. The pupils, when\r\nvisiting the village, are always quiet and gentlemanly. Officers from\r\nWest Point train them in military tactics, and it is marvelous what a\r\nproficiency they attain in a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF CRAWFORD.\r\n\r\nBy J. Erskine Ward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis triangular township, some eighteen or twenty miles west of the\r\nHudson River, is in the northwest corner of Orange County, bordering\r\nupon the counties of Sullivan and Ulster. It carries a point of\r\nOrange County land well up into old Ulster County and contains the\r\nnorthernmost soil of the county.\r\n\r\nIt is bounded on the north by Sullivan and Ulster, on the east by\r\nUlster and the town of Montgomery, south by Montgomery and Wallkill,\r\nand on the west by the town of Wallkill and Sullivan County.\r\n\r\nThe area of the town, as given in the last report of the Orange\r\nSupervisors, is 24,769 acres. Upon this land the Crawford assessors\r\nfor 1906 placed a valuation of $664,531, and returned personal\r\nproperty of its residents to the value of $15,300. The total tax\r\nraised in the town that year was $8,617.89. This amount was made up\r\nas follows: General fund, $2,668.14; poor fund, $600; town audits,\r\n$2,287.12; roads and bridges, $400; railroad purposes, $2,107.50;\r\ntemporary relief, $250; sworn off taxes, $185.45; treasurer's\r\ncredits, $115.33.\r\n\r\nThe name Crawford came from a numerous and respectable family of\r\nIrish descent who were among the first settlers of the locality. The\r\nland was a part of the original John Evans patent referred to in\r\nother parts of this work. When this great tract was set aside the\r\nterritory of this section was disposed of in many smaller grants to\r\nPhilip Schuyler and others. Among the many other tracts mentioned in\r\nthe Crawford titles were the 8,000-acre tract which now includes the\r\nvillage of Pine Bush, and the 10,000-acre tract next on the south.\r\nThe following separate patents were included in the Crawford\r\ntownship; Thomas Ellison and Lawrence Roome, November 12, 1750;\r\nFrederick Morris and Samuel Heath, January 24, 1736; Jacobus Bruyn\r\nand Henry Wileman, April 25, 1722; Philip Schuyler and others, 8,000\r\nacres, July 7, 1720; part of the patent to Jeremiah Schuyler and\r\nothers, January 22, 1719; part of Thomas Noxon's patent February 21,\r\n1737.\r\n\r\nNATURAL FEATURES OF THE TOWN.\r\n\r\nThe general altitude of the town is somewhat higher than that of\r\nMontgomery. The general surface is a hilly upland broken by high\r\nridges, which extend northeast and southwest. It is in fact separated\r\nfrom Montgomery by one of these elevated ridges known as the\r\nCollaburgh and Comfort Hills, which at times rise 200 feet above the\r\nvalley. While the land is somewhat more difficult to cultivate\r\nbecause of the stony hills and undulating surface, the soil is very\r\nstrong and productive, yielding fine crops of grass, grain and fruits\r\nand responding well to tillage. These slopes and elevations have been\r\nfound particularly well adapted to the growth of fruit of a superior\r\nquality. The proximity of the mountain range is said to have a\r\nfavorable influence upon the general rainfall of the region. Showers\r\nare frequent in summer and the effects of drought are less severe than\r\nin other sections not so favored.\r\n\r\nThe Shawangunk Kill or river is the principal stream, and it forms\r\nthe western boundary of the town between it and Sullivan County, and\r\nafterward it also separates the town from Ulster County until the\r\nnorthern limit of the town is reached. This is a rapid flowing stream\r\nand affords much valuable water power at different points, which has\r\nbeen utilized to some extent in a variety of ways. The early settlers\r\nwere quick to see the value and importance of these privileges, and\r\nthey began to make use of them in their primitive manner at once.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous tributaries to the Shawangunk in the town is the\r\nPaughcaughnaughsinque. The name is of Indian origin. There are in\r\nfact two of these subsidiary streams, the Big and the Little\r\nPaughcaughnaughsinque. They flow northward and afford additional\r\nwater power at different points.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern portion of the town is a more important stream known\r\nnow as the Dwaarskill. This, too, has enjoyed a great variety of\r\northographic nomenclature, such as \"Dwaaskill,\" \"Dwarf'skill,\" etc.\r\nOf course the original was bestowed by the Indians, and, it is said,\r\nwas given in honor of a Chief of a small tribe which dwelt upon its\r\nbanks. One of the old settlers in that region is credited with having\r\nseen this Indian Chief, who was called \"Dwaase,\" and who had his\r\nwigwam near the old turnpike gate No. 3. Others claim, however, that\r\nthe name is clearly Low or Holland Dutch, and signifies perverse or\r\ncontrary because it flows north. The stream begins somewhere near the\r\ncenter of the town of Wallkill, not far from the Crawford Railway\r\njunction, flows through the valley parallel to that of the\r\nShawangunk Kill, and finally leaves the town at the northeast corner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Joel Whitten]\r\n\r\nThis town also has its share of swamps, of which the historian\r\nRuttenber says Orange County has over 40,000 acres. One of these\r\nswamps is northwest of the Sinsabaugh neighborhood, and another is\r\nsouthwest of Searsburgh.\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENT AND SETTLERS.\r\n\r\nThis being among the newer towns of the county, the specific details\r\nof its settlement are so blended with the early history of the old\r\nWallkill precinct and that of the town of Montgomery, from which\r\nCrawford was set off, that it is quite impossible to separate them\r\nfor this place.\r\n\r\nThe Weller settlement was partly upon this territory. Johannes\r\nSnyder started a small settlement in the vicinity of Searsville,\r\nwhere he bought a large tract of land on both sides of the\r\nDwaarskill. He built a primitive log mill there at once, and this is\r\ndown in the records of 1768 as Snyder's Mill. He seems to have been\r\na man of means and influence, as he also built a log church soon\r\nafter settling there, which was known as Snyder's Church. This\r\nSnyder family was Dutch and made the first settlement here in 1740,\r\nif not earlier. All the services in this little church was in the\r\nDutch language, and it is recorded that the church was worn out or\r\noutgrown even before the Revolution.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about the same time Robert Milliken built a saw mill on\r\nthe Shawangunk Kill. This is referred to as Milliken's mill in the\r\nrecords of 1768, and this is the earliest mention of a saw mill on\r\nthat stream in the records. Other mills were built there, however,\r\nin later years. First was the old flour mill of Pat. Boice, next\r\nbelow the Milliken mill was the Sear's grist mill, then Abraham\r\nBruyn's flour mill, and finally Cornelius Slott's saw and grist mill\r\ncombined. The latter was continued by Arthur Slott after the death of\r\nhis father, and he soon built a small collection of houses there for\r\nhis employees. This Slott ancestry were among the oldest settlers in\r\nthe State. The family came from Holland in 1670, as the family\r\nrecord shows. They located first at Hackensack, N. J., and after a\r\nfew years there they removed to Rockland County, and soon after that\r\nthey came to Montgomery and settled on the Tinn Brook at a point\r\nafterward known as Slott Tow. Cornelius Slott engaged in farming. In\r\n1777, while serving as an orderly sergeant with his military company,\r\nin the active defense of Fort Montgomery, he was taken prisoner and\r\nconfined in the old Sugar House, New York, by the British forces for\r\nten months. In 1785, on regaining his liberty, he sold his farm and\r\nlived in New York for the next five years. Then he bought the mill\r\nsite in Pine Bush and erected his saw mill just below the mouth of\r\nthe Paughcaughnaughsinque stream. The next year he also built a\r\ngrist mill. There was no public road leading to his mill at the time,\r\nbut he soon secured one from Hopewell.\r\n\r\nA small early settlement near Graham's Church was made by Abraham\r\nDickerson, an Irishman, John Robinson and Philip Decker. Philip\r\nDecker's ancestors came from Holland. When sixteen years old he\r\ndrove a team from Ward's Bridge to Valley Forge with a load of corn\r\nfor Washington's army. Dickerson built a saw mill on a small stream\r\nnear there which was operated successfully for a time and then fell\r\ninto decay. The portion of the Wallkill valley in this town was the\r\nsite of the earliest settlement. These old pioneers consisted of\r\nGermans, Hollanders and Huguenots. Many of them came from the older\r\nsettlements in Ulster County, and others were directly from their\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\nRobert Jordan came here from Ireland in 1771. About 1784 he settled\r\nat Bullville in this town. His brother John seems to have settled\r\nthere in 1767, having arrived in this country some years ahead of\r\nRobert. Among his neighbors there about that time or a few years\r\nlater, were Joseph Elder, James Barclay, Samuel Barclay, John Martin\r\nand Daniel Bull. Thomas Turner was also a land owner in the Bullville\r\nsettlement to the extent of 300 acres.\r\n\r\nIn the Searsville neighborhood William Snider was among the pioneers.\r\nHe purchased a large tract of land there upon which he lived many\r\nyears before the Revolution. He seems to have been a man of some\r\nwealth, for at the outbreak of hostilities with Great Britain he\r\nburied a considerable sum of money in a secret place upon his\r\nproperty, the location of which was known only to a faithful Negro\r\nslave. After the war this Negro was awarded by his master with his\r\npersonal freedom because of his loyalty and faithfulness.\r\n\r\nAn old apple orchard planted before the Revolution near Bullville,\r\ndied out long years since. Nathan Johnson was the village shoemaker,\r\ngoing around from house to house with his kit of tools strapped upon\r\nhis back. This occupation was then known as \"whipping the cat\" for\r\nsome reason not very clear at this time. Johnson was an old\r\nshoemaker who had been employed making army shoes during the war. It\r\nwas the custom at that period for those cobblers to go about at\r\nstated periods and do the family cobbling and shoe-making for the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWilliam Jordan, son of Robert, became colonel of the Shawangunk\r\nregiment of militia, and he lived under every President of the United\r\nStates until his death, having voted the Democratic ticket for 66\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Sears is mentioned in the records as a remarkable man in\r\nmany respects among the settlers in that region. Coupled with rare\r\nnative talent he had a most remarkable memory of details. Nothing\r\never escaped him when once his mind grasped it. All his accounts were\r\naccurately kept in his mind. But his education is said to have been\r\nvery limited. He served as constable in the town of Montgomery during\r\nhis early life, where he had five brothers from whom there has been a\r\nlong line of descendants. He also served as sheriff of Orange County\r\nfor a time. And the small hamlet of Searsburgh, near the center of\r\nthe town, on the Dwaarskill stream, was named for him. He established\r\na flour and saw mill there at an early date.\r\n\r\nJoseph Elder was of Irish descent and came into this region some\r\nyears before the Revolution. He lived upon a very stony farm, and it\r\nis recorded of him that being a man of giant frame, robust and\r\nvigorous, he would gather up these stones in a leathern apron girded\r\nabout his loins and carry them to the place where they were used for\r\nfence walls, instead of carting them in a wagon. Though also scantily\r\neducated, he served some years as magistrate of his town with much\r\nsatisfaction, being a man of strong common sense and good judgment.\r\nHe seems also to have been a pioneer pedestrian, the original\r\nWeston, apparently; for it is recorded that on a certain occasion,\r\nmissing his sloop at Newburgh, which was already out of sight above\r\nthe Danskammer Point, running with a fair wind, on the Hudson, on its\r\nway to Albany, young Elder started off at a rattling pace, with his\r\nmusket and knapsack, to join his military company at the Capital in\r\ntime or be denounced as a traitor. It is said he beat the sloop by\r\nseveral hours, though the precise time made is not given.\r\n\r\nDr. Joseph Whalen, another well known Irish pioneer, was among the\r\nearly physicians practicing his profession in this region. He came at\r\nthe close of the war, settled in this town for a few years, and\r\nafterward practiced in Montgomery for over fifty years. It is worthy\r\nof note in this connection that in those days no doctor ever expected\r\nto collect for his services from his patient in person. The doctor's\r\nclaim was always presented to the executor or administrator, as the\r\ncase might he, after the patient's death. There were obvious reasons\r\nfor this custom then, as there often are even in these later times,\r\nbut the reader must be left to draw his own conclusions. This noted\r\ndoctor had a most extensive practice, and he was also a famous\r\nhorseman and equestrian, owning much fine horseflesh. He even rivaled\r\nthe celebrated Count Pulaski, the Polish general in the Revolution,\r\nwho would throw his hat before him on the road while under full speed\r\non his horse and so far dismount as to take it up. Dr. Whalen could\r\ntake a glass of liquid in his hand, mount his horse, ride away a\r\nquarter of a mile and return without spilling a drop.\r\n\r\nDaniel Bull was another prominent settler of this region. He came\r\nsome years before the Revolution and settled upon an extensive tract\r\nof newly cleared land which was rough and stony and had been owned by\r\nhis father, Thomas Bull, who lived in the old stone house in\r\nHamptonburgh. This land was then valued at $2.50 per acre. In 1780 he\r\nmarried Miss Miller at Goshen, where the bride and groom were\r\nsnowbound for two weeks of their honeymoon. They had thirteen\r\nchildren and the family became one of the most prominent and numerous\r\nin the town. Mr. Bull was a most successful farmer, and he reclaimed\r\na vast acreage of wild land and brought it under good and profitable\r\ntillage. He amassed wealth and became a valued citizen, being long\r\nregarded as a patriarch of the town. In 1821, the record shows, that\r\nfifty-two grandchildren had been born of this parentage, making a\r\nfamily total of seventy-six. All were then alive except two who died\r\nin infancy, and on a certain day in June of that year seventy-four\r\nmembers of this noted family were gathered in the family homestead\r\nnear Bullville for a grand reunion. The farm is now owned by\r\nTheodore Roberson.\r\n\r\nThe Crawford family, after which the town was named, were descendants\r\nof John Crawford, who settled in New Windsor in 1737. The names of\r\nJohn, William, James and Samuel are found upon the old military roll\r\nof 1738 for the Wallkill. Robert I. Crawford was a prominent citizen\r\nhere early in the last century, and he lived near the old Hopewell\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe Thompson brothers, Alexander, Andrew, and Robert, came from\r\nIreland about 1770. They bought 500 acres of land on what became\r\nafterward known as Thompson's Ridge, and divided the plot equally\r\namong themselves. One of these farms then included the site of the\r\nHopewell church, and all this property has been kept in the Thompson\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nDavid Rainey was another ante-revolutionary settler in this locality,\r\nand he established what was afterward known as the \"brick-house\r\nfarm,\" near Pine Bush. He erected the first brick house between\r\nNewburgh and Ellenville. Although only a boy during the Revolution,\r\nhe served for a short time in the Continental Army under Clinton.\r\nThe ancestor of Jacob Whitten was also among the pioneers there.\r\n\r\nAmong the early physicians of the town were Dr. Crosby, who lived\r\nnear the Hopewell church and practiced during the early part of the\r\nlast century; Dr. Charles Winfield, who lived near Pine Bush; Dr.\r\nHunter, of Searsville, who later served as school inspector for that\r\ntime; Dr. Griffith, also of Pine Bush, who died in 1855, and Dr.\r\nDurkee, who lived a mile south of Pine Bush.\r\n\r\nTOWN ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe town of Crawford was formed from the town of Montgomery, March 4,\r\n1823. That older town covered such a large extent of territory that\r\nit was found inconvenient and expensive to conduct the public\r\nbusiness to advantage. A convenient and practicable arrangement of\r\nboundary lines for a division of the town was found possible whereby\r\nthere might be a central point convenient of access for the citizens\r\nof each town. The name Crawford was given in honor of that pioneer\r\nfamily, as before stated, many of its descendants having become so\r\nclosely identified with the local interests of the region.\r\n\r\nThe first town meeting was held at the house of Edward Schoonmaker,\r\nApril 1, 1823. William W. Crawford was then chosen the first\r\nsupervisor; Oliver Mills, town clerk, and a full list of officials\r\nwas selected. Every man was authorized to act as his own pound-master,\r\nand every farm was regarded as a pound. A bounty of $25 was voted for\r\nevery wolf killed in the town, which shows that these hungry animals\r\nwere still roaming through the forests at that time. At a special\r\nmeeting held later in the month, $460 was voted to be raised for the\r\nsupport of the poor for that year. There were then thirty-nine road\r\ndistricts in that little town, and each district had its accredited\r\nroad-master. But the records are not clear as to the character or\r\nextent of the road work done in that early period. Of course every\r\nmale citizen was required to appear for service upon the road at such\r\ntime or times as the master of his district would designate, and put\r\nin such number of days' work as his property possessions called for\r\nunder the prevailing provisions of the State road laws. The\r\nroad-master was the boss, and if he said the roadway must be highly\r\nrounded in the center, a plow was run deeply along each side of the\r\ntrack and the loose mud or dirt was scraped up into the road with\r\nhoes or shovels. Then the wagon wheels would throw out this mud\r\nduring the rest of the year when it was not frozen, where the workers\r\nof the succeeding year would find it again, waiting to be scraped\r\nback into the roadway. This was the old process of road repair for\r\ntwo hundred years, and there seems to have been general satisfaction\r\nwith the curious method as far as the records disclose. In fact, the\r\npublic highways were not regarded of great importance in those days\r\nin spite of the fact that they were the leading if not the only\r\narteries of transportation throughout the country before the advent\r\nof railways and cheap water-line shipment. These observations are\r\nmade in this connection because of the recent dawn of a new era in\r\nroads and road work, when the great importance of public roads and\r\ntheir proper repair and maintenance has at last been more nearly\r\nrecognized. Very soon these antiquated methods will be among the\r\ncurious events in history.\r\n\r\nWhen the Middletown and Crawford Railway was projected through this\r\ntown the sum of $80,000 was raised by the town authorities in aid of\r\nits construction. This was in July, 1868. The interest upon this\r\ndebt has been paid annually since that time, but in 1880 no part of\r\nthis principal sum had yet been paid. This was a severe tax upon the\r\ntown which bore rather heavily upon the farmers especially, a class\r\nthat rarely escapes the lion's share of these burdens of modern\r\ncivilization. But the railway has been of great value to every\r\nresident as a developing factor of that entire region and none now\r\nregrets its cost.\r\n\r\nVILLAGES OF THE TOWN.\r\n\r\n_Hopewell._--This village is in the western portion of the town, not\r\nfar from the Shawangunk River. The name was taken from the old\r\nHopewell church, which was an offshoot from the Goodwill Presbyterian\r\ncongregation at Montgomery, where the Congregational section had been\r\nsqueezed out, as it were. They were thus in need of hope at the time,\r\nand thus the name \"Hopewell\" was suggested by some of the more\r\nthoughtful members, and it was very promptly adopted for the church\r\nname, as it afterward was also for the little village which gathered\r\nabout it. It does not appear that any important business or\r\nmercantile trade was ever conducted there, however. It is merely a\r\nfertile farm section where the residents have gathered to make their\r\nhomes. The postal facilities for these people are at Thompson's\r\nRidge, a station on the Crawford branch of the Erie Railway.\r\n\r\n_Bullville._--This is in the southwestern portion of the town near\r\nthe Wallkill line. It was named in honor of Thomas Bull, who lived\r\nthere many years and engaged in various business enterprises, and in\r\nfact founded the place. While the name of the hamlet is not\r\nespecially felicitous, nor even euphonious, the location is\r\nattractive and pleasing, it being upon high ground with a fine view\r\nof the surrounding landscape. A fine commodious Methodist church was\r\nbuilt there many years ago and there is a most attractive cluster of\r\nfine dwellings. In 1880 a hotel was conducted by Silas Dickerson and\r\na general store by Charles Roe. There were also a creamery, two\r\nblacksmith shops, a flour and feed store, a coal yard and even a\r\ndistillery. The place is seven miles west of Montgomery village.\r\n\r\n_Searsville._--This was formerly known as Searsburgh. It is another\r\nsmall village, near the center of the town, on the Dwaarskill. It was\r\nnamed for, and practically founded by, Benjamin Sears, already\r\nmentioned at some length. He built the mills there at an early date,\r\nand his more distant neighbors soon gathered about him and built\r\ntheir homes there. It was formerly a trading point of some\r\nimportance, but the advent of the railway brought other neighboring\r\nhamlets into greater prominence and left this place somewhat\r\nisolated. But in 1880 there were a hotel, two blacksmith and wagon\r\nshops, a grist mill and a saw mill still in operation. There is also\r\na post-office. The location being central, the town meetings were\r\nusually held there in past years, and the general official business\r\nwas transacted there.\r\n\r\n_Thompson's Ridge._--A short distance west of Searsville, on the\r\nCrawford Branch Railway, is this hamlet, as before stated. In former\r\nyears it was mainly composed of the Thompson family, for which it was\r\noriginally named. Daniel Thompson, the railway superintendent, lived\r\nnear there. The station is quite an important one both for its\r\npassenger business and the large shipments of milk which are made\r\nfrom it. A small store, the post-office, and the various railway\r\nstructures make up the business part of the hamlet. It is in the\r\nmidst of the finest farming section of Orange County, the farms of\r\nthe Thompson family and others in that neighborhood being the most\r\nproductive in the county.\r\n\r\n_Collaburg._--This is in the southern section of the town, and the\r\nname is now printed \"Collabar\" on the modern map of the county. The\r\nlocality is somewhat thickly settled. It was formerly an important\r\npoint on the Newburgh and Cochecton turnpike, with a hotel and many\r\nother buildings of a varied character. But the new railway did not\r\ntouch the place and travel was soon diverted to other points, which\r\nstopped all further development there.\r\n\r\n_Pine Bush._--This is located near the Shawangunk River, in the\r\nnorthern part of the town, near the Ulster County line, and it is a\r\nthriving business village, the most important in the town. It is the\r\nnorthern terminus of the Crawford Branch Railway, and its post-office\r\nserves a large section of country on both sides of the river in that\r\nregion. The village site is generally level and attractive, upon the\r\nhigh bank of the stream at that point, and the land environment\r\ncomprises a most fertile farming section. The old grist mill there\r\nbelongs to the Revolutionary period, and the Shawangunk Mountains\r\nrise in rugged, frowning peaks which overlook the valley and form a\r\nbackground of rare beauty. The heights of the Hudson River are seen\r\nin the distant horizon toward the east and north, and there is a rare\r\ncombination of upland, valley, mountain and stream, forest slopes and\r\nwell tilled farms which charms the beholder and forms a most\r\nattractive and beautiful landscape. Summer visitors are attracted\r\nhere in large numbers, and they find much to admire and enjoy.\r\n\r\nAmong the early tradesmen here was James Thompson, who opened a store\r\nin 1824. He was succeeded by Hezekiah Watkins, Tarbosch & Weller,\r\nLouis Wisner, Elijah Smith and George Oakley. Dr. Ewan came in 1830,\r\nand built a hotel and also conducted a drug store. Abraham Mould\r\nbegan a tannery plant in 1825, but after a few years he was killed by\r\nJames Mitchell in a violent personal quarrel, for which Mitchell was\r\nfinally acquitted on the ground of self defense.\r\n\r\nThe old Ellenville and Newburgh plank road--a wicked production of a\r\nbenighted period--passed through Pine Bush. This, however, marked the\r\nbeginning of the modern growth of the place. There were then only\r\nthree or four dwelling houses. In 1880 there were in addition to the\r\nvarious railway structures, two hotels, several stores, many shops of\r\nvarious kinds, a restaurant, grist mill and saw mill, meat market,\r\nphotograph gallery, livery stable, distillery, marble works, and a\r\ngreat variety of other business enterprises. The post-office was\r\noriginally known as Crawford, and Arthur Slott was probably the\r\nfirst postmaster. The name of the village was bestowed on account of\r\nthe dense growth of pine trees which formerly covered that entire\r\ntract of land. The opening of the railway was of course a great\r\nevent for Pine Bush and had much to do with its subsequent\r\ndevelopment and progress. Mr. A. R. Taylor, a leading business man,\r\ncame from Ulsterville in 1848 and proved a most progressive citizen,\r\nopening many new stores and taking an active part in all village\r\nimprovements. He was a civil engineer and was credited with having\r\ndriven the first stake in Chicago during an engagement in the west\r\nmany years ago, which if true is a well merited distinction.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF THE TOWN.\r\n\r\nOliver Mills, Alexander Thompson and Hieromous Weller were the first\r\nschool commissioners chosen at the formation of the town. From 1843\r\nto 1856 the public schools were under the control of town\r\nsuperintendents chosen at each annual election. There were ten school\r\ndistricts in 1823, and 655 children between the ages of five and\r\nfifteen in the town, small portions of the towns of Wallkill and\r\nMontgomery being then included in this enumeration. The amount of\r\npublic money received was $264.44. Among the early school teachers of\r\nthis town were John Hardcastle, William Brown, Mr. Reed and Mr.\r\nCrosby. And they are said to have been firm believers in the free\r\nuse of the rod in the inculcation of a thorough knowledge of the\r\nthree \"Rs\" and the maintenance of proper discipline.\r\n\r\nTHE CRAWFORD CHURCHES.\r\n\r\nThe first effort to build a church in Hopewell was made in 1779 by\r\nthe Presbyterian association. But they succeeded only in completing\r\nthe exterior of the building and very little was done toward\r\nfinishing the inside of the structure. And yet for the next three\r\nyears those devoted Christian people were content to worship in this\r\nunfinished building with all its discomforts. They went to church\r\nfaithfully and regularly. In 1792 they united in a corporate body and\r\nselected a full board of trustees, as follows: William Cross, Robert\r\nMilliken, Jonathan Crawford, Daniel Bull, Andrew Thompson, Nathan\r\nCrawford, Abraham Caldwell, Robert Thompson and Robert McCreery. Soon\r\nafter this they finished their church and called the Rev. Jonathan\r\nFreeman as their pastor, who was installed August 28, 1793. This may\r\nbe regarded therefore as the date of the organization of this church,\r\nwhich began with twenty-one members. Mr. Freeman multiplied this\r\nnumber by five during the next five years and then resigned for\r\nanother field of labor. The next five years this little pulpit\r\nremained vacant. Rev. Isaac Van Doren took up the work there in 1803\r\nand labored most successfully for 21 years, adding some 152 members\r\nto the little flock of worshipers during that period. Then, after\r\nfurther changes in the pastorate, a new and more commodious church\r\nbuilding was built of stone on another site, which was completed in\r\n1832. Rev. John H. Leggett was then the pastor for the next\r\ntwenty-three years, when he went to Middletown. His ministerial work\r\nin this Hopewell church is highly spoken of in the records, he being\r\na powerful preacher and a man of great activity and influence.\r\n\r\nWhat was known as _Graham's Church,_ associated Reformed, was\r\nestablished by Robert Graham in 1799. A house of worship was erected\r\nat once and it was opened for use in August of the same year. Mr.\r\nGraham died a few weeks later, but he devised 100 acres of land to\r\nthis church organization for its pastor. This church was merely a\r\nbranch of the older organization at Neeleytown until 1802, when it\r\nbecame independent, with Samuel Gillespie and Andrew Thompson as\r\nelders. There were then only 28 regular members, and the Rev. John\r\nMcJimsey still served both this and the Neeleytown church. He left in\r\n1809 but returned ten years later and remained until his death in\r\n1854. Robert Graham, the founder of this church, was a staunch\r\nScotch-Irish Presbyterian, and he left a lasting impress for good\r\nupon this people.\r\n\r\n_The Crawford Methodist Church_ is located at Bullville and it was\r\nincorporated April 20, 1859. The trustees named were Jacob M.\r\nShorter, Robert Hill and Herman S. Shorter. The original church\r\nstructure was completed in the summer of 1861 at a cost of $8,000,\r\nwhich was donated by Mrs. Mary Shorter. Rev. John Wardle was the\r\nfirst pastor, being assigned there in response to a request of Mrs.\r\nShorter.\r\n\r\n_The Methodist Church of Pine Bush_ was incorporated November 28,\r\n1870. with the following trustees: William B. Barnes, John Walker,\r\nSamuel Armstrong, William H. Cowley and Francis M. Bodine. But there\r\nhad been religious services there many years before this, especially\r\nin the school house. The old Reformed Church over the river at\r\nShawangunk, in Ulster County, had many members in the Pine Bush\r\nvillage, and there was preaching in the little school house nearly\r\nevery Sunday, either by the pastor of that church or by the Methodist\r\npreacher from Bullville. But the Methodist people were not satisfied\r\nwith this arrangement and they finally built a church for themselves,\r\ncompleting it in the spring of 1871 at a total cost of $8,000, of\r\nwhich only half had been paid. But the balance was pledged at the\r\ndedication ceremonies held on the night of April 24, 1871. This\r\nbuilding was repaired and improved some ten years later.\r\n\r\nHISTORIC POINTS OF INTEREST.\r\n\r\nNear the site of the old Slott grist mill on the bank of the river is\r\nan old log hut which is said to date back to the ante-Revolutionary\r\nperiod. During that war this hut was on the Van Amburg property, and\r\nthat family was somewhat closely connected with the noted Anneke\r\nJans, who once owned the ground now covered by the vast estates of\r\nTrinity Church in New York City, in which her myriad heirs, scattered\r\nall over America to-day, still claim an equitable share, and justly\r\nso, perhaps. In this old log structure once lived a stalwart female\r\nmember of the Van Amburg family, and the story is that during the\r\nRevolution a big reward was offered by the British officers for her\r\ncapture. \"Shanks Ben,\" a noted Ulster County Tory, like Claudius\r\nSmith of Orange County, being attracted by this rich reward, planned\r\nher capture. He concealed himself in one of the farm haystacks where\r\nhe knew she would come to feed her cattle at a certain time. But when\r\nhe saw the huge old-fashioned hay-fork in her hand, he concluded that\r\ndiscretion was the better part of valor, and was in fact glad to\r\nescape with his own life, fearing she might chance to puncture his\r\nbrave anatomy in reaching for the required hay-fodder. If this\r\nsomewhat noted woman was ever captured by the redcoats the records\r\nfail to disclose it.\r\n\r\nAside from the pursuit of farming and lumbering, this town has never\r\nbeen able to boast of any very important industries. Nearly every\r\ncitizen was engaged in the cultivation of the soil during its early\r\nhistory at least. As already noted, the town was famed for its\r\nproduction of the choicest grade of Orange County butter. In later\r\nyears, under the changed condition of transportation facilities, the\r\nmanufactured products of the dairy were almost entirely discontinued\r\nand gave way to the natural product of milk, which was shipped to the\r\nNew York markets in large quantities.\r\n\r\nThe growth of apples, peaches and other fruits, for which the land is\r\nso well adapted, has meanwhile increased in extent and importance,\r\nand many of the Crawford orchards that were properly cultivated and\r\ncared for have become sources of large profit to their owners.\r\n\r\nWhile many of the more ancient grist and saw mills of the town have\r\nnow disappeared, some have been greatly improved and modernized and\r\nnew ones have been built.\r\n\r\nMILITARY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nOn this topic little can be said with reference to the early history\r\nof this separate section, as the town came into existence some time\r\nafter the close of the wars with foreign nations. All such data is\r\nhopelessly buried in the ancient annals of Wallkill and Montgomery\r\nso far as the Crawford chronicler is concerned. There were doubtless\r\npatriots of this section who served in the Continental army of\r\nWashington, and others who went out in the military company during\r\nthe second outbreak in 1812. But the records contain no separate\r\nlists of these and this roll of honor cannot therefore be presented\r\nhere. Philip Decker, David Rainey and Joseph Elder, the only names\r\nwe can positively identify as being residents of what is now the town\r\nof Crawford, who served in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nBut in the War of the Rebellion the record is more complete. While,\r\nlike most other towns in nearly every county in the northern States,\r\nthere were misguided men in Crawford, partisans, politicians and\r\nabject followers of that class, servile men with little principle and\r\nless brains, who opposed the war on political principle, or through\r\nignorance of the situation, without regard to the safety of the\r\nAmerican Union of States, the great majority of the citizens, here as\r\nelsewhere, were loyal Union men. And when the first secession gun\r\nbelched forth on Fort Sumter the old spirit of patriotism which had\r\nanimated their ancestors was fired anew. The town furnished 188 men\r\nfor the Union army and navy under the various calls of President\r\nLincoln and the draft. Sixty-nine men went forward at once under\r\nCaptain Samuel Hunter, who organized a company of volunteers in the\r\ntown known as Co. H, which was attached to the 124th Regiment. The\r\nsum of $525 was raised by subscription in 1862 for bounties paid to\r\n21 volunteers who enlisted in the 168th Regiment, and $50 was raised\r\nfor a like purpose in connection with the regiment first named. In\r\n1863 $3,000 was raised and $27,610 the following year. Then, under\r\nthe last call, $16,500 was added to these cash contributions from\r\nthis town, making the total sum $47,685. On the final settlement with\r\nthe State after the war, $11,700 of this amount was returned to the\r\ntown for excess of years and bounties. A tax of $30,000 was\r\nauthorized in January, 1865, but as is seen above only a portion of\r\nthis amount was required.\r\n\r\nThe record contains a detailed list of the men furnished by the town\r\nfrom which it appears that ten enlisted in the 56th Regiment in 1861,\r\none in the 18th, five in the 19th, and twelve in other regiments\r\nduring the first year. Then in 1862, twenty-one went out in the\r\n124th, and thirty in the 168th. Twenty-nine enlisted in various other\r\norganizations in 1863 and 1864, and twenty-nine others were drafted\r\ninto the service, most of whom furnished substitutes.\r\n\r\nAs showing who were among the leading farmers in this town in the\r\nearly part of the 19th century, it will be of interest perhaps to\r\nquote a few items from an old list of agricultural premiums awarded\r\nat the county fairs held in that period. In 1820 Daniel Bull was\r\nawarded $20, for the best farm of 100 acres in the town. He also had\r\nthe second best fat oxen. The next year Henry Bull got $10 for the\r\nsecond best farm, and Daniel Bull $15 for the best working oxen. In\r\n1822 Henry Bull had the best three acres of winter wheat, for which\r\nhe was awarded a prize of $10. Moses Crawford then received a like\r\naward for 2,051 pounds of butter from twenty cows. In 1823 Moses\r\nCrawford received a four-dollar prize for the third best piece of\r\ndressed woolen cloth, also various other prizes for white flannel,\r\nlinen, etc. William Gillespie then had a fine exhibit of sewing-silk,\r\nfor which he received a prize. These items are taken at random from\r\nan old record which, strangely enough, does not contain the first\r\nawards in many cases.\r\n\r\nThe population of Crawford, according to the national census of 1880,\r\nwas 1,951, which was a decrease from that of 1870 of seventy-three.\r\n\r\nThe Pine Bush Library Association was organized November 10, 1899, at\r\na meeting held in Wallace Hall for the purpose of considering the\r\npracticability of establishing a public library in the village. H. J.\r\nMcKinney, Mrs. Joel Whitten, J. E. Ward, Mrs. J. L. Acheson, D. T.\r\nBowen, Miss Emma B. Shaper, S. K. Seybolt and Mrs. Nelson Van Keuren\r\nwere chosen trustees. H. J. McKinney was elected president, retaining\r\nthe office until his death, September 24, 1907. While ably\r\ndischarging the duties of the position, he was a liberal contributor\r\nto the support of the library. He supervised the construction of the\r\nbuilding it now occupies.\r\n\r\nThe library was incorporated December 21, 1899, receiving from the\r\nState University a provisional charter. December 1, 1904, a permanent\r\ncharter was granted.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of\r\nPine Bush the library was kept in the rooms of that organization\r\nwithout cost to the association, until the summer of 1907, when it\r\nwas removed to its present home. This was remodeled from a building\r\npresented to the Library Association by H. P. Taylor, a resident of\r\nthe village, and is a substantial edifice with an attractive\r\ninterior, admirably arranged for library purposes.\r\n\r\nThe library, which is free, now numbers more than 2,000 well selected\r\nbooks. The funds for its support are derived from the membership\r\ndues, contributions, lectures or entertainments, and the State\r\nappropriation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTOWN OF DEER PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION, AREA AND TITLE.\r\n\r\nThis town is located in the extreme western angle of Orange County.\r\nIn outline the territory forms nearly a perfect triangle. It is one\r\nof the larger towns in the county, having an area of 37,020 acres,\r\naccording to the latest tax tables of the Orange supervisors, being\r\nexceeded only in extent by the town of Warwick. It is also next to\r\nthe largest in population, having 11,562 inhabitants, according to\r\nthe State census of 1905. It is also a most important town in\r\nseveral other respects, as will be seen from the comprehensive\r\noutline presented in the succeeding pages.\r\n\r\nIt contains the point of land where three States intersect--New York,\r\nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania. This precise point is known as the\r\n\"Tri-States Rock.\" This solid rock is at the extreme point of the\r\ntongue of land lying at the mouth of the Neversink River and between\r\nthat stream and the Delaware River. A copper bolt has been sunk in\r\nthis rock to mark the spot which has been agreed upon by the\r\nauthorities of these States. By standing over this bolt one is\r\ntherefore in three different States at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the full legal import of this strategic point of\r\nvantage has been well understood by certain classes, or made use of\r\nin critical emergencies, is not definitely known. It is, however, one\r\nof the show places of Port Jervis, and visitors may easily find it by\r\na short walk through Laurel Grove Cemetery.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the town assessors reported a total value of taxable property\r\nof $2,431,680, upon which a tax of $37,374.27 was levied. These\r\namounts have been increased to $2,509,003, and $41,378.65\r\nrespectively, the valuation of the two banks not included, $379,706,\r\non which their tax is levied.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the small tracts known as the Arent Schuyler\r\npatent, the Tietsort 400 acre patent, and the Cuddeback patent, the\r\ntitle to all the land of Deer Park comes from the Minisink patent.\r\nThis name was originally spelled \"Minnisink.\" The tribal Indian\r\noccupants were first known as the Minquas, and subsequently as the\r\nMinsis, from which the present name seems to have been evolved.\r\n\r\nCaptain Arent Schuyler visited this region in 1694, during that\r\nturbulent period of war with the savages, in order to determine how\r\nfar the influence of the French had effected the aborigines.\r\n\r\nThe town is bounded on the north by Sullivan County, on the southeast\r\nby Mount Hope and Cornwall, {_sic_} and on the southwest by New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and the County of Sullivan.\r\n\r\nNATURAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe topographical features of Deer Park are peculiarly marked. There\r\nis the broad valley of the Neversink on the east, reaching from\r\nnortheast to southwest. This soil is exceptionally fertile, and here\r\nit was that the early settlers began to build their cabins and blaze\r\ntheir way into the thick forests.\r\n\r\nA short, distance from the Neversink stream the old Delaware & Hudson\r\nCanal was constructed and operated for many years, the line being\r\nnearly parallel to the river. This great coal artery from the mines\r\nto the Hudson was, however, abandoned in 1898 after seventy years of\r\nsuccessful operation, and the new Ellenville & Kingston Railway took\r\nits place.\r\n\r\nThe Neversink stream has no important tributaries from the east. On\r\nthe west the Old Dam Kill comes into the main stream at Huguenot.\r\nThis drains a large portion of the central territory and gives some\r\nvaluable water power. Basha's Kill is the largest branch entering\r\nfrom the east near Cuddebackville.\r\n\r\nThe Delaware River separates the town from Pennsylvania on the\r\nsouthwest, and the Mongaup branch of the Delaware divides the town\r\nfrom Sullivan County. Tributaries of this Mongaup stream drain the\r\nhigher central portions of the town. Still other tributaries of the\r\nDelaware flow through the Honesdale region.\r\n\r\nThe general surface of the town is a mountainous upland broken by\r\nmany small streams which often flow through rocky ravines. There are\r\nsteep declivities along the Delaware, Mount William and Point Peter\r\nbeing the most attractive features near Port Jervis. Along Basha's\r\nKill the bottoms are known as the Mamakating valley. Those along the\r\nNeversink constitute the Suckapack valley, until the junction with\r\nBasha's Kill is reached, when it is called the Neversink valley\r\nproper, although also known as the Peenpack. This valley extends to\r\nthe mouth of the Neversink at Carpenter's Point. If space permitted\r\nit would be interesting to trace the origin and significance of these\r\nquaint names.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. H. Gariss]\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\nIn 1689 the old town of Schenectady in New York State was captured by\r\nthe Indians after a bloody fight. Among the residents there who fled\r\nfrom the place was one William Tietsort (now written Titsworth), who\r\ncame to the land of Esopus first, but soon afterward went to this\r\nMinisink region and settled in these forests. After a residence there\r\nof some years he sought the right to purchase a tract of land there.\r\nThis was in 1698, and he succeeded in obtaining the land. His title\r\nto this tract, though in dispute for a time, was finally confirmed,\r\nand it was excepted from the Minisink patent. This tract was\r\nafterward sold to John Decker, and the location is thought to have\r\nbeen near Port Jervis. Thus the honor of being the first settler\r\nseems to belong to this William Tietsort.\r\n\r\nOther pioneer settlers came into the Peenpack valley and also in\r\nMamakating Hollow. Most of these old pioneers seem to have taken such\r\nlands as suited their fancy with very little regard to who the owner\r\nmight be. Many of these came in from the famous Esopus region, and\r\nthese were mostly of that thrifty Dutch stock which made that\r\nancient region so famous and important in the formative period of the\r\nState and national history. Nearly all settled along the streams\r\nwhere the advantages of fertile soil and level land seemed most\r\nattractive and important.\r\n\r\nIn 1697 Arent Schuyler received his patent, which covered a large\r\ntract in the Minisink country called by the natives Sankheheneck,\r\notherwise Mayhawaem, also another tract called \"Warinsayskmeck,\r\nupon the river Mennessincks before an island called Menagnock, which\r\nwas near the Maghaghkemek tract and contained 1,000 acres and no\r\nmore.\" About the same time another grant of land containing 1200\r\nacres was given to Jacob Codebeck, Thomas Swartwout, Anthony\r\nSwartwout, Bernardus Swartwout, Jan Tys, Peter Gimar and David\r\nJamison.\r\n\r\nBoth these patents were in the Peenpack valley, and they were so\r\nimperfectly described in the titles that it was impossible to fix\r\ntheir precise location or boundaries. They were therefore regarded as\r\n\"floating\" patents or tracts, and the grantees were inclined to take\r\npossession of most any unappropriated lands in that valley and settle\r\nwhere they saw fit. This led to much difficulty in the succeeding\r\nyears, and when it became necessary to divide this Minisink patent\r\nthe commissioners found no end of trouble.\r\n\r\nThe patentees Codebeck and Gimar were French and came here after a\r\nbrief sojourn in Maryland. They married into the Swartwout family,\r\nwhich was a sturdy, vigorous stock, well able to cope with the\r\nwarlike natives and ferocious wild animals and dense forests as\r\npioneers.\r\n\r\nThe seven joint owners of this patent are said to have come into this\r\nregion in 1690, although there is no authentic record of any white\r\npeople there until 1694. The land covered by this patent laid along\r\nthe Neversink River and Basha's Kill. Mamakating Hollow was then the\r\nnearest settlement, some twenty-five or thirty miles north.\r\n\r\nIn those days the settlement of a new country was indeed a herculean\r\ntask with the meager facilities then existing. And this was\r\npreeminently true of this town, which was still slumbering in a\r\ndense primeval forest. Plows and all other implements were of the\r\ncrudest description. What little grain was grown by these ancient\r\nfarmers had to be cut with a knife or rude sickle, and then the grain\r\nwas separated from the straw by the tramp of horses upon the\r\nthreshing floor. It was afterward winnowed from the chaff by\r\nhand-fans made of willow rods. This was the universal practice in\r\nthis region down to 1760. The first fanning mill was brought in here\r\njust previous to this by Peter Gumaer. The wagons were made almost\r\nentirely of wood and the harness of flax and tow. During the long\r\nwinter evenings while the men were making these things the women\r\nwere spinning and reeling yarn. Not the yarn of the idle gossiper,\r\nas now, but the fiber and fabric of utility which went into their\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nThe old Esopus region was some fifty or sixty miles north and the\r\nroads were left to the vagaries of Dame Nature. But these pioneers\r\nhad to cart their corn and other produce there for sale. Wheat was\r\nthe staple crop, and Jacob Codebeck of this town was the first to\r\nattempt grinding it in a small mill. One of these millstones, about\r\ntwo feet in diameter and three inches thick, is still in the Gumaer\r\ncellar near where the old mill stood. This was afterward followed by\r\ntwo other grist mills on the \"Old Dam Brook.\" Then came the De Witt\r\nmill in 1770, on the Neversink River near Cuddebackville, and others\r\nin later years. These ancient mills had no devices for bolting the\r\nflour as now; thus after the grinding process, the whole had to be\r\nsifted by hand in order to secure the fine flour for bread-making and\r\nother culinary uses.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest saw mills was erected in this town soon after\r\n1760.\r\n\r\nIt should be said in this connection that there is some traditionary\r\n{_sic_}evidence of a still earlier settlement in this Minisink region\r\nwhich takes the date back even to 1650. Most of these claims, however,\r\nseem based upon certain letters written by Samuel Preston of\r\nStockport, Penn., in 1828. In these letters he gave the recollections\r\nof John Lukens, Surveyor General of Pennsylvania, as to this very\r\nancient settlement. His memory extended back to 1730. On this rather\r\nhazy authority it is claimed that the first settlement was prior to\r\n1664, when the region was still in the possession of the Dutch, and\r\nthat the settlement was abandoned at the English conquest. But there\r\nare no existing documents to substantiate any such claim, and the\r\nentire weight of evidence seems to clearly disprove it.\r\n\r\nThe records show that in 1714 the only freeholders in Maghaghkemek\r\nwere Thomas Swartwout, Harmon Barentsen, Jacob Cuddeback, Peter\r\nGumaer and Jacobus Swartwout. To these were added, fourteen years\r\nlater, the names of John Van Vliet, Jr., Samuel Swartwout and\r\nBernardus Swartwout, Jr. This would show a very small increase in 38\r\nyears, assuming that the settlement began in 1690.\r\n\r\nThis town became important also because of the long dispute over the\r\nboundary line between the States of New York and New Jersey. The\r\nvariance of this line over which the conflict arose was in this\r\ntownship. The owners of the Minisink and the 1,200 acre patents were\r\nmuch disturbed for years by the New Jersey State authorities, who\r\nclaimed the line ran considerably farther north of the Delaware River\r\nthan the Deer Park people had established it. The New Jersey people\r\nclaimed a large portion of this 1,200 acre patent through which they\r\ninsisted the line ran, they procured a colony title to this disputed\r\nportion of that patent. The precise location of the line being vague\r\nand uncertain, no action at law could be maintained by either side,\r\nbut a bitter struggle ensued and lasted for many years. The trouble\r\nseems to have arisen over the meaning of the phrase \"the northernmost\r\nbranch of the Delaware River,\" which was the language used in the\r\ndescription of title. There was a big triangular gore of land in\r\ndispute. This conflict lasted nearly seventy-five years, and then it\r\nwas finally settled by an equitable division of the land in question.\r\n\r\nAmong the residents on this disputed land was Major Swartwout, and\r\nthe Jersey claimants planned to oust him from the property by force.\r\nHe was prepared for such an attack, but in spite of all his loaded\r\nguns it seems that about 1730 the Jerseyites routed him from the\r\nhouse and threw out all his goods. But with the assistance of friends\r\nin Goshen the major was reinstated, and he afterward successfully\r\nrepelled another attack made about ten years later. He was, however,\r\ncaptured and imprisoned, together with Johannes Westbrook, another\r\nresident of the battleground, some time between 1764 and 1767, by a\r\nstrong force of Jersey men who surrounded his church on the Sabbath,\r\nand seized the two men at the close of the service, after a fierce\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nSoon after this a new line was agreed upon and the fight ended by the\r\npassage of a royal edict at the Court of St. James in September,\r\n1773. Commissioners of the two States afterward ran the line in\r\naccordance with that agreement.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, one hundred years later, commissioners representing the two\r\nStates made a resurvey with the assistance of the United States\r\nCoast Survey officials, which finally settled the great controversy\r\nfor all time.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, an old assessment roll of district No. 3, which was the\r\nsouthern portion of Deer Park, comprising the present territory of\r\nPort Jervis and vicinity, contained forty-eight names of property\r\nholders. The largest of these was Johannes Decker, who was assessed\r\nfor 17 pounds 8 shillings and 7 pence. Next in order was Anthony\r\nVan Etten, John Wells, Abraham Van Auken and Johannes Decker, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe De Witt family of this town were descendants of Tjerck Clausson\r\nDe Witt, who came from Holland and settled in Wiltwyck, now Kingston,\r\nat a very early date. It was a very prominent family here and many of\r\nits members achieved distinction.\r\n\r\nAmong other prominent settlers in this region were Peter Gumaer, Jan\r\nTyse, Bernardus Swartwout, Jacob Cuddeback, Anthony Swartwout, David\r\nJameson, and Hermanns Van Inwegen.\r\n\r\nThe very earliest physician in this region was Doctor Chattle, and he\r\nsettled near Carpenter's Point and practiced there until his death,\r\nmany years later. He came in at the opening of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nCIVIL ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nJust when the civil organization of Deer Park was formed is not\r\ndefinitely known. The Legislative act of October 18, 1701, provided\r\nthat the \"people of Maghachemeck, the Great and Little Minisink,\r\nshould vote in the County of Ulster.\" This would imply that they were\r\noutside of that county. This territory covered what is since known as\r\nCuddebackville and vicinity. Eight years later the boundary between\r\nthe counties was more definitely fixed by the Legislature. Soon after\r\nthis the territory went under the name of Maghachemeck, remaining\r\nunder this jaw-breaking title until 1743, when the precinct of\r\nMamakating was erected, which was at least a slight improvement upon\r\nthe old name.\r\n\r\nThis continued until 1798 when the town of Deer Park was organized.\r\nThe first Mamakating precinct meeting was held at the house of Samuel\r\nSwartwout. This territory then included \"all the land to the\r\nsouthward of the town of Rochester as far as the County of Ulster\r\nextends, and to the westward to the precincts of Wallkill and\r\nShawangunk.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the name Minisink was applied to the territory above named, it\r\nhas been contended by some writers that there was in addition a\r\nprecinct of Minisink, and there are documents which seem, to\r\nestablish this fact even as early as 1739. But this precinct seems\r\nto have been erected along the Delaware River below what afterward\r\nbecame Carpenter's Point.\r\n\r\nThe territory now in Deer Park south of the old county line\r\ncomprising Port Jervis and vicinity was a part of the town of\r\nMinisink from 1789 to 1825.\r\n\r\nThe first supervisor of the Mamakating precinct elected in April,\r\n1774, was Benjamin Dupuy. The first supervisor of Deer Park elected\r\nin April, 1798, was James Finch, and he remained in that office by\r\nsuccessive elections until 1810, when Peter E. Gumaer succeeded him.\r\nBut Mr. Finch was again selected to serve the town in that capacity\r\non three different occasions.\r\n\r\nThe earliest assessment roll of the town now preserved in the town\r\nclerk's office, which was the first roll of Deer Park after the\r\ndivision of the territory, is that of 1825. This shows a total\r\nvaluation of $114,820, and there were fifteen persons on the list\r\nfor over $2,000, the highest being Peter E. Gumaer at $6,230.\r\n\r\nCENTERS.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Port Jervis the centers of population in the\r\ntown are small and unimportant. Among them may be mentioned\r\nWestbrookville on the line of the old canal, northeast of\r\nCuddebackville; Port Orange, a short distance south on the canal\r\nline; Cuddebackville, in the northeastern part of the town, named in\r\nhonor of the pioneer settler, Jacob Cuddeback; Rose Point, a station\r\non the Monticello Railway; Port Clinton, still further down the\r\nvalley; Gumaers, also on the old canal line, and Huguenot, between\r\nthis and Port Jervis. Near this point are valuable mineral springs,\r\ndiscovered in 1860. In 1880 a pipe line for the transmission of\r\npetroleum oil to tide water was constructed through this section,\r\nwith stationary engines and a power plant for forcing this oil to\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nCarpenter's Point is a very old locality, named for an early settler,\r\nwho established a ferry across the Delaware River there at a very\r\nearly period. It is near Port Jervis on the south and the famous\r\n\"Tri-States rock\" is located here at the extreme point. This rock\r\nmarks the junction of the States of New York, New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania. There are several stores, an old grist mill, and many\r\ndwellings. A bridge here spans the Neversink River which was built in\r\n1868.\r\n\r\nSparrowbush is another hamlet and post-office on the old canal line.\r\nBushkill is in the western part of the town, and Quarryhill is a\r\nlocal mining district still farther west. Shin Hollow is a\r\nneighborhood on the slope of the Shawangunk Mountain where the Erie\r\nRailway crosses the town line into Mount Hope. Paradise is a small\r\nhamlet on the Sullivan border northeast of Cuddebackville, and\r\nHonesville and Bolton are other small hamlets born of the canal\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nCEMETERIES.\r\n\r\nThe Gumaer graveyard is believed to be the oldest burial place in the\r\ntown. Some of the old stones have inscriptions which show that\r\nburials were made there very early in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe old Maghachemeck graveyard is in the southern section of the\r\ntown at Port Jervis. Previous to 1907 this ground was much neglected,\r\nand its condition was anything but creditable to the citizens of that\r\ngrowing village. Interments were made there long prior to the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. J. J. Mills.]\r\n\r\nThe Laurel Grove cemetery is situated in the extreme southeastern\r\npart of Port Jervis. This was established in 1856 by John Conklin,\r\nwho owned the site, and it is the modern cemetery now in use. It\r\ncontains many fine monuments and the lots and drives are well kept.\r\nThe name Laurel Grove was most appropriately bestowed because of the\r\nthick natural growth of the American laurel on the ground. In 1857\r\nthe Weeping Willow cemetery was begun in Port Jervis. This is St.\r\nJohn's burial ground next the Reformed church. Among other cemeteries\r\nare that of the Reformed church, started in 1833, the Catholic\r\ncemetery, also in Port Jervis, and the Rural Valley cemetery in\r\nCuddebackville, opened in 1867. In the early eighties the Weeping\r\nWillow cemetery was purchased by the village of Port Jervis and\r\nconverted into a site for a school building, the bodies being removed\r\nto other cemeteries.\r\n\r\nMILITARY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the French war of 1775 there were only about\r\nthirty families within the present limits of Deer Park township. It\r\nwas then divided into upper and lower neighborhoods. In the upper or\r\nnorthern part, near the old county line, three small forts were\r\nbuilt; one on the Neversink, another at the house of Peter Gumaer,\r\nand the third near the home of Peter Swartwout. There were also three\r\nforts in the lower neighborhood on the south.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, however, that most of the Indian occupants of this\r\nregion had left before the opening of this French war. But they\r\nreturned in force when the Revolution began and attacked some of the\r\nearly settlers in 1777. These attacks soon became more frequent and\r\nalarming, and the Committee of Safety was obliged to resort to very\r\nvigilant methods in repelling the ferocious savages. Three other\r\nforts were built in the Peenpack section, and these were manned by\r\nsoldiers known as the nine-months' men. Many of the women and\r\nchildren were sent out of the town to more safe quarters. About this\r\ntime there were some fifty families in the town and they moved into\r\nthe forts for protection. But the settlement was attacked by a force\r\nof Indians and Tories about that time and afterward, and many were\r\nkilled in the conflicts. Many of the houses and barns were burned and\r\nmuch of the crops were destroyed during these Indian raids.\r\n\r\nMany stirring incidents of those days are recorded, but much of this\r\nrecord is merely traditional and lacks authentic documentary evidence\r\nin its support.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war the people were practically in a destitute\r\ncondition, and it took them a long time, with the very meager\r\nfacilities at hand, to reinstate themselves. Even the Continental\r\npaper currency had greatly depreciated in value, and it was necessary\r\nto build mills to make material for rebuilding their homes and barns.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Revolution Major John Decker was one of the\r\nmost prominent citizens in the Minisink valley, and it is said that\r\none of the objects of these Indian raids was to secure the scalp of\r\nMajor Decker. They succeeded in burning his house to the ground and\r\ndestroyed all his property during his absence from home at night,\r\ndriving out his family to sleep on the banks of the Neversink River,\r\nbut they didn't get the Major's scalp, though he was wounded while\r\nriding his horse homeward, and barely escaped with his life by hiding\r\nin a cave.\r\n\r\nThe Brandt raid of what was known as the lower neighborhood occurred\r\nin July, 1779. News of the atrocities perpetrated by the Mohawk chief\r\nand his savage followers was conveyed to Goshen, where a pursuing\r\nforce of militia was organized by Colonels Tusten and Hathorn. They\r\novertook Brandt at the ford of the Delaware at Lackawaxen, Pa., and\r\nin the sanguinary struggle which took place on the heights above\r\nLackawaxen on the New York side of the river, the Indians were\r\ncompletely victorious. The force under Hathorn and Tusten was almost\r\nannihilated, but few escaping to tell the tale of the disaster. Of\r\nthese men were Captain Abraham Cuddeback of Deer Park, and Daniel\r\nMeyers of Minisink, who is said to have killed more Indians than any\r\nother man during the engagement.\r\n\r\nThe town took its full patriotic share in the struggle to save the\r\nUnion of States. Dr. John Conklin presided at the first meeting of\r\ncitizens, April 18, 1861, and prompt measures were adopted. Nearly\r\n$1,000 was raised, and there were many donations for the soldiers and\r\ntheir families. The Ladies' Aid Society was formed with Mrs. H. H.\r\nFarnum as president, in September, 1862, and this association of\r\npatriotic women forwarded supplies to the front amounting to $843.63.\r\nUnder the call of President Lincoln for 500,000 men in 1864 a tax of\r\n$48,600 was raised by the town to pay bounties for soldiers of $300\r\neach. An additional tax of $155,300 was afterwards raised for a like\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe Deer Park roll of honor in that war numbers 428. Of these some\r\nforty-five lost their lives in the service of their country.\r\n\r\nIn the Spanish-American war of 1898 eighty-two volunteers for\r\nservice in Cuba were recruited in Port Jervis by Captain Benham and\r\nothers under the auspices of Lafayette Post, G. A. R., of the city of\r\nNew York. Of these, forty-four were attached to Company I of the\r\nSecond U. S. Infantry; thirty-five to the 42d U. S. Infantry, and the\r\nremainder entered the Artillery and Cavalry arms of the service. The\r\nrecruits for this war came mainly from Port Jervis, but a few came\r\nfrom surrounding districts.\r\n\r\nBONDED DEBT.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of May 4, 1868, the town of Deer Park was bonded for\r\nthe sum of $200,000 to aid in the construction of the Monticello and\r\nPort Jervis Railroad. These bonds drew 7% and ran thirty years to\r\ntheir maturity. In 1898 they were refunded at 4% and provision made\r\nfor the gradual payment of the principal. There is now (1908)\r\noutstanding in these bonds $161,000.\r\n\r\nTHE MONTICELLO R. R.\r\n\r\nThe Monticello and Port Jervis Railroad Company was incorporated\r\nSept. 3, 1868. It ran between Port Jervis and Monticello and opened\r\nfor traffic January 3, 1871. It was sold in foreclosure July 8, 1875,\r\nand subsequently reorganized as the Port Jervis and Monticello\r\nRailroad Co. Its history has been a checkered one. It is now operated\r\nby the Ontario & Western Railroad as a part of its system.\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF PORT JERVIS.\r\n\r\nPort Jervis had its beginning in 1826 when the building of the\r\nD. & H. Canal became a certainty. It was named in honor of John B.\r\nJervis, of Rome, N. Y.. a distinguished civil engineer, who\r\nsuperintended the construction of the canal. As late as 1846 a\r\nwriter thus describes Port Jervis:\r\n\r\n\"It is a small village on the canal where it first approaches the\r\nDelaware. It is just above Carpenter's Point (Tri-States) and the\r\njunction of the Neversink and Delaware Rivers. It owes its population\r\nand its importance to its position about midway between Honesdale,\r\nPa., and Kingston, N. Y., the two terminals of the D. & H. Canal.\r\nThere are five stores in the village; three taverns in spacious\r\nbuildings; one three-story grist mill, built by Dr. Ball, of\r\nBrooklyn, N. Y., being a stone building with five run of stone in it;\r\nthree churches, a Dutch Reformed, Baptist, and Methodist, and one\r\nlarge school house. Coal and lumber are sold in considerable\r\nquantities. A mail route from Kingston, N. Y., to Milford, Pa., and\r\nthence to Philadelphia, passes through the village.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the population of the village was small, and Port Jervis\r\nwas equaled if not exceeded in importance by the neighboring hamlet\r\nof Carpenter's Point, where the post-office was located and courts\r\nwere held.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Erie Railroad to Port Jervis, January 1, 1848,\r\ngave a wonderful impetus to its growth. The directors of the company\r\ncelebrated the event by an official trip over the road from Piermont\r\non the Hudson River, its eastern terminus, to Port Jervis, where the\r\nentire population of the surrounding country were gathered to\r\ncelebrate their arrival. Cannon boomed and flags and bunting floated\r\nfrom every house top. A banquet was served at the hotel of Samuel\r\nTruex on the southwestern corner of Pike and Main streets, during\r\nwhich the president of the road, Benjamin Loder, made an address\r\ncongratulating all concerned in the successful completion of the\r\ngreat enterprise as far as Port Jervis. The subsequent growth of the\r\nplace was rapid. Its position as the headquarters of the Delaware\r\ndivision of the road and the terminus of its eastern division and the\r\nlocation here of extensive machine and car shops gave it a large\r\nrailroad population, which has been and still is the principal\r\ncontributing element to its prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the village was incorporated and the first charter election\r\nwas held in August following. The total village expenses for the\r\nfirst year was $1,350. Samuel Fowler was the first president.\r\n\r\nPort Jervis became a city by an act of the Legislature of the date of\r\nJune 26, 1907, and at the first election under the city charter, held\r\nin the ensuing November, the following city officials were elected:\r\nMayor, Dr. H. B. Swartwout; aldermen, Joseph Johnson (at large),\r\nF. N. Mason, Andrew Hensel, A. F. Brown. P. C. Rutan, C. F. Van\r\nInwegen, Thomas Mulhearn, James Howell and James I. Delaney. The\r\nfirst five named are republicans, the others democrats. The following\r\nappointments were made by the Common Council: City clerk, A. P.\r\nAltemeier; city engineer, Irving Righter; commissioner of charters,\r\nJohn M. Snook; superintendent of streets and sewers, Theodore\r\nLudlum; chief of police, William Wilkin. Supervisors from the four\r\nwards were elected as follows: First Ward, S. S. Garriss, dem.;\r\nSecond Ward, Henry Farnum, rep.; Third Ward, J. J. Toth, rep.;\r\nFourth Ward, J. P. Gillen, dem.\r\n\r\nThe population of Port Jervis in 1907, according to the census of the\r\nState excise department, taken in that year for the purpose of\r\nfurnishing a basis upon which to adjust license rates, was 10,035.\r\nBut as the census was not intended to be exhaustive and practically\r\nstopped when the 10,000 limit was reached, leaving certain sections\r\nuncounted, it is fair to presume that the actual population was\r\nconsiderably in excess of the figure named.\r\n\r\nThe assessed valuation of the city of Port Jervis for the year 1907\r\nwas $2,000,000; for the town of Deer Park about $500,000.\r\n\r\nThe city has eighty-two industrial establishments including the car\r\nand machine shops of the Erie Railroad, employing over 1,000\r\noperatives. The principal manufactured commodities are saws,\r\nglassware, silk, gloves and mittens, shirt and ladies' collars. These\r\nindustries give employment to many skilled operatives who receive\r\ngood wages. The city has three hardware stores and two iron\r\nfoundries.\r\n\r\nAmong the important industries of Port Jervis is the Deer Park\r\nBrewery Co., located on Reservoir avenue. The company was organized\r\nin 1902 with George F. Ott, of Philadelphia, as president. The plant\r\nof the insolvent Deer Park Brewery Co. was purchased and greatly\r\nimproved and enlarged.\r\n\r\nSTREET RAILROAD.\r\n\r\nThe Port Jervis Electric Street Railway Company was organized in\r\n1895 with Hon. W. C. Richardson, of Goshen, as the first president.\r\nThe work of construction began November 15, 1897, and the road went\r\ninto operation January 15, 1898. The road is now known as the Port\r\nJervis Electric Railroad Co. It has about 4 1/3 miles of track and\r\nruns three cars.\r\n\r\nBANKS.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of the two banking establishments of this place, the\r\nNational Bank of Port Jervis, was organized under the State law as\r\nthe Bank of Port Jervis, in March, 1853. Business was opened in the\r\nDelaware House. The original capital was $120,000, afterwards\r\nincreased to $130,000. Its first president was Thomas King, who\r\nserved until his death in 1857, when he was succeeded by H. H.\r\nFarnum, who served until his death in 1879. The late Charles St.\r\nJohn succeeded him and the late Francis Marvin became president in\r\n1892 on the death of Mr. St. John. The present incumbent of the\r\noffice is W. L. Cuddeback.\r\n\r\nThe heavy defalcation of the assistant cashier led to a\r\nreorganization of the institution in 1899 with Dr. W. L. Cuddeback\r\nas president. The last annual report, December 5, 1907, showed\r\ndeposits amounting to $550,738.04. The present dividend rate is 7-1/2\r\nper cent, per annum.\r\n\r\nThe First National Bank was organized in 1870 with a capital of\r\n$100,000. Jacob Hornbeck was the first president. The late Martin\r\nC. Everett succeeded him. The present head of this prosperous\r\ninstitution is Chas. F. Van Inwegen. Its last report, on December 3,\r\n1907, showed total deposits of $1,001,621.46. The stock pays 16 per\r\ncent. dividends to stockholders.\r\n\r\nThe Port Jervis Savings Bank, organized under the State law, began\r\nbusiness in March, 1870, with Eli Van Inwegen as president. It\r\ndiscontinued business in the later seventies.\r\n\r\nTHE POST-OFFICE.\r\n\r\nThe post-office was removed from Carpenter's Point to Port Jervis in\r\n1829, and John Slauson was the postmaster. He was succeeded by Dr.\r\nJohn Conklin in 1833, followed by Dr. Charles Hardenburgh in 1845,\r\nwho was soon displaced by Thomas J. Lyon. Then came Dr. Conklin again\r\nin 1849, Francis Marvin in 1851, Thomas J. Lyon again in 1853, James\r\nVan Fleet in 1855, George Brodhead in 1857, Augustus E. Goodale in\r\n1861, Charles St. John, Jr., in 1879, Benjamin Ryall in 1885,\r\nStephen St. John in 1889; George A. Elston in 1893; S. D. Boyce in\r\n1897. Mr. Boyce still (in 1908) continues in office.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Port Jervis fire department was long regarded among the best in\r\nthe State outside the large cities, and few destructive fires were\r\never allowed to gain much headway. The introduction of the\r\nwater-works system gave ample hydrant pressure to cope with any\r\nconflagration, and the old hand engines were long since abandoned.\r\nThere are seven different fire companies with a force of considerably\r\nover 200 effective fire fighters. The equipment included a steamer\r\nand hook and ladder apparatus. P. C. Rutan is chief engineer of the\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nPORT JERVIS FREE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 was organized the Port Jervis Free Library, with W. L.\r\nCuddeback, W. H. Nearpass, Maria B. Van Etten, Minnie C. Brox\r\nand E. H. Gordon, trustees. This board has continued in charge of the\r\nlibrary until the present time except that, in 1896, Mrs. Brox\r\nresigned and was succeeded by Mrs. M. I. Coonrod. In 1901 a gift of\r\n$20,000 was received from Mr. Carnegie for the construction of a\r\nlibrary building, which was subsequently increased to $30,000, and\r\nwith this fund a large, handsome, commodious building was constructed\r\non Pike street hill on a site given by Peter E. Farnum. The building\r\nis constructed of light colored pressed brick with native blue stone\r\ntrimmings. It will house 40,000 volumes. The number at present on\r\nthe shelves is 15,000; added during the year 1907 by purchase, 1,062;\r\nthe number lent for home use during the current year, 33,706. It is\r\nrich in encyclopedias and valuable works of reference, including the\r\nCongressional Record and Globe, and reports of the departments of the\r\nFederal and State governments. The valuable collection of books and\r\ndocuments of the Minisink Valley Historical Society is also housed in\r\nthis building, a separate room on the second floor having been set\r\napart for the accommodation thereof. This building contains two\r\nspacious, well equipped reading rooms, in which may be found all the\r\nleading reviews, magazines, and weekly periodicals, with complete\r\nfiles of many of them handsomely bound and ranged about the walls for\r\nconvenient reference.\r\n\r\nThe present librarian is Miss Elizabeth G. Thorne; assistants, Miss\r\nCharlotte Nearpass and Miss Anna G. Wells.\r\n\r\nSEWERS.\r\n\r\nPort Jervis has an excellent system of public sewers, established in\r\n1891 at a cost of about $85,000, for which the bonds of the village\r\nwere issued. The original sewer commissioners were Francis Marvin,\r\nL. E. Carr, George Schoonover, W. A. Drake, M. D. Graham, with Ed.\r\nWhitner, clerk. Its establishment has resulted in a lowering of the\r\ndeath rate and a notable diminution in zymotic diseases within the\r\ncity limits.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\nPort Jervis has eight churches, which in the order of their\r\nestablishment are as follows: _The Reformed Church of Deer Park,_\r\nfounded August 23, 1737, under the name of the _Reformed Dutch\r\nChurch_ of Mahackemech; _Drew Methodist Episcopal Church_ and the\r\n_Baptist Church,_ both founded in 1838; _First Presbyterian,_\r\nincorporated July 15, 1851; _Grace Episcopal Church,_ incorporated\r\nSeptember 3, 1853; the _Church of the Immaculate Conception,_\r\nincorporated January 10, 1860; _German Lutheran Protestant,_ Port\r\nJervis, incorporated January 1, 1861; the _Second Reformed Church,_\r\nwhose house of worship on West Main street (in Germantown), was\r\ndedicated November 29, 1896, with Rev. David T. Harris as pastor;\r\nthe _Church of Sacred Heart_ (in Germantown), whose handsome church\r\nedifice of brick was dedicated in November, 1899, with Rev. B. J.\r\nDuffy, ordained in Rome, as first pastor.\r\n\r\nThe colored people also have a church organization known as the\r\n_Wickham A. U. M. P. Church,_ in honor of the late Dr. D. T. Wickham,\r\nthe principal contributor to their church building.\r\n\r\nST. MARY'S HOME.\r\n\r\nA religious, educational and charitable institution of great merit\r\nand usefulness is St. Mary's Home, founded in 1871 by the late Rev.\r\nFather Nelan, its object being to provide a home for orphan children\r\nand to train and instruct them for a useful place in society. For\r\nover twenty years this institution has been in charge of Sister\r\nTheophelia, a woman whose motherly instincts and marked\r\nadministrative abilities peculiarly fit her for this highly\r\nimportant work.\r\n\r\nMINISINK VALLEY HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nAn event of great importance to the residents of this town was the\r\norganization of the Minisink Valley Historical Society in 1888. Among\r\nthe active promoters of this undertaking were Rev. Dr. S. W.\r\nMills, Francis Marvin, Dr. John Conkling, O. P. Howell, Dr. Sol Van\r\nEtten, C. E. and W. L. Cuddeback, W. H. Nearpass and C. F. Van\r\nInwegen. Its collection of relics and manuscripts is large and of\r\ngreat value to the genealogist and historian. Its library numbers\r\nmore than 1,500 volumes of books and pamphlets. Its manuscripts\r\nexceed 1,000 in number. With the facilities offered by its new home\r\nin the Carnegie Library building and protection and safety provided\r\nby its fireproof vaults, it will in time become the repository of\r\nall valuable documents and manuscripts in this vicinity.\r\n\r\nOLD BURYING GROUND RESTORED.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1907 a notable work was accomplished by the\r\nMachackemech Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, of\r\nwhich Mrs. Charles F. Van Inwegen is the president, in clearing and\r\nbeautifying the grounds of the old historic Machackcmech cemetery on\r\nEast Main street next to the Catholic cemetery. Through long neglect\r\nthe cemetery had fallen into a condition of utter decay and ruin. The\r\nground was covered with a dense growth of weeds, briars and\r\nunderbrush, and the memorial stones, some of them dating back to a\r\nperiod anterior to the Revolution, were for the most part so weather\r\nbeaten and moss-grown that their inscription was difficult to\r\ndecipher, in some cases were totally illegible. All this has been\r\nchanged, and now this hallowed ground \"Where the rude forefathers of\r\nthe hamlet sleep\" has been restored to order and beauty and no longer\r\noffends by its wild and neglected appearance.\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS MONUMENT.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous ornament to the public square of the city (Orange\r\nSquare) is the soldiers' monument, erected in 1886 through the\r\nliberality and public spirit of Diana Farnum, widow of H. H. Farnum,\r\nwhose gift of $10,000 defrayed the cost thereof. It commemorates the\r\nvalor and patriotism of the soldiers from Deer Park who took part in\r\nthe great struggle for the preservation of the Union in 1861-5. It\r\nwas unveiled to the public on July 4, 1886, in the presence of a\r\nvast multitude of spectators. L. F. Carr, Esq., of Port Jervis, and\r\nGeneral Stewart L. Woodford, of Brooklyn, N. Y. were the orators of\r\nthe occasion. The ceremonies were in charge of Carroll Post,\r\nG. A. R., of Port Jervis.\r\n\r\nFLOODS IN PORT JERVIS.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Port Jervis near the confluence of the Delaware and\r\nNeversink Rivers exposes its low-lying parts to occasional overflows\r\nof these streams in times of heavy rainfall and more especially\r\nduring the break-up of ice at the end of the winter season.\r\n\r\nThe channel of the Delaware at this place is shallow and obstructed\r\nby rapids and islands against which descending masses of ice become\r\nlodged, damming back the water and producing what is known as an\r\nice-gorge. Such an event occurred in the latter part of February,\r\n1875, when the channel of the river for several miles in extent was\r\nfilled with a gigantic accumulation of broken ice. For several weeks\r\nthe village was threatened with inundation and various unsuccessful\r\nexpedients were resorted to to start the ice moving. The excitement\r\nculminated on March 17, when the \"gorge\" gave way, carrying with it\r\nthe iron railroad bridge across the Delaware above Sparrowbush, which\r\nin descending the stream on top of the moving ice, struck and swept\r\naway the Barrett suspension bridge at Port Jervis. For a short time\r\njust before the break-up of the \"gorge\" the lower part of the village\r\nas far as the Erie tracks was flooded with water.\r\n\r\nOn October 10, 1903, a ten-inch rainfall in forty hours caused both\r\nrivers to overflow their banks, submerging the low-lying parts of the\r\ntown. Barrett bridge across the Delaware was again carried away, and\r\nfive persons who were on it at the time lost their lives.\r\n\r\nOn March 8, 1904, a flood caused by an ice gorge destroyed the iron\r\nrailroad bridge across the Delaware at this place and the suspension\r\nbridge across the Neversink. The lower section, of the village was\r\nsubmerged to a depth of three feet and the portion across the Erie\r\ntracks to a depth of from seven to ten feet.\r\n\r\nThis succession of disasters emphasized the necessity for protective\r\nmeasures of some kind, and the matter was taken in hand by the\r\nvillage Board of Trade, as a result of whose deliberations a bill\r\nwas presented and passed at the ensuing session of the Legislature,\r\nappropriating the sum of $35,000 for diking the Delaware at Port\r\nJervis. This money was used to excellent purpose and a substantial\r\ndike was built under the direction of the State engineer, extending\r\nfrom the upper part of Germantown to Barrett bridge. To afford the\r\nneeded protection, however, this work should be extended down the\r\nriver bank to Laurel Grove cemetery. Bills for the necessary\r\nappropriation have been introduced at the successive sessions of the\r\nLegislature, but for various reasons have failed to pass. A more\r\nfortunate issue is expected from the one introduced by Senator\r\nTaylor at the present session. Another State appropriation of\r\n$10,000 was spent in strengthening and clearing the channel of the\r\nClove Brook at Tri-States and a pumping station has been established\r\nat the foot of Wagner Place, by means of which accumulated surface\r\nwater is drained off in times of flood. An effort is also being made\r\nthrough Representative Thos. W. Bradley to secure the aid of the\r\nFederal government in clearing and deepening the channel of the\r\nDelaware and removing obstructions from Storm Island, about a mile\r\nbelow the city.\r\n\r\nCANAL ABANDONED.\r\n\r\nThe canal of the Delaware & Hudson Company was abandoned in 1878.\r\nSamuel D. Coykendall, of Kingston, purchased the right of way, and\r\nsold it to the Pennsylvania Coal Company, by whom a coal carrying\r\nroad from the anthracite field to tide water along the old canal\r\nroute was projected. The enterprise was defeated by the purchase by\r\nthe Erie Railroad Company of the stock of the Pennsylvania Coal\r\nCompany, which carried with it ownership and control of the old\r\nright of way and blocked threatened competition in the carriage of\r\ncoal to tide water.\r\n\r\nERIE CHANGES.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1890 the Erie removed its passenger station from\r\nthe foot of Pike street to the Brown building in Jersey avenue,\r\nnear its junction with Fowler street. This building was remodeled and\r\nenlarged and made over into one of the finest depots along the line\r\nof the Erie road. It was destroyed by fire on Christmas night of the\r\nsame year and the present handsome structure erected on its site.\r\n\r\nOn Easter Sunday, 1905, the company transferred the headquarters of\r\nthe principal Delaware division official from Port Jervis to\r\nSusquehanna. This involved the removal of thirty officials and\r\nassistants, including the superintendent, train master, division\r\nengineer, division plumber, and division carpenter.\r\n\r\nGOOD ROADS.\r\n\r\nThis section will benefit by the good roads movement lately adopted\r\nby the State, and Port Jervis may naturally expect considerable\r\nincrease of trade and perhaps of population from the three State\r\nroads now in process of construction which converge in this city. One\r\nof these begins in Middletown, passes through Wawayanda and\r\nGreenville and comes out upon the road leading from Tappentown to\r\nTri-States. Another starts from Middletown and passes through\r\nOtisville and Cuddebackville, taking at the last named place the old\r\nroad pronounced by the State inspector to be one of the finest in the\r\nState. A third leads from the Sullivan County line at Rio on the west\r\nto Port Jervis.\r\n\r\nCITY IMPROVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe year just passed has witnessed the organization of a City\r\nImprovement Association composed of ladies, the object of which is\r\nsufficiently indicated by its name. It has an active corps of\r\nofficers and members animated by a praiseworthy spirit of civic\r\npride. Mrs. Maria B. Van Etten is the president.\r\n\r\nPLACES OF SPECIAL NOTE.\r\n\r\nTri-States Rock, situated at the confluence of the Delaware and\r\nNeversink Rivers, at which the boundary lines of three States--New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania and New Jersey--intersect, is one of the show\r\nplaces of the town. The rock is at the extreme point of the narrow\r\ntongue of land lying between the two rivers and at the mouth of the\r\nNeversink. The geological formation is rocky and will stand the wear\r\nof the floods for centuries to come as it has for centuries past. A\r\nsmall monument now marks the spot.\r\n\r\nThe site of the old Dutch church on the Van Inwegen land directly\r\nopposite the old Machackemech cemetery on Main street is suggestive\r\nof historic memories. Here assembled for worship in the old log\r\n\"meeting house\" of 1743 the pioneer families of this section. The\r\nhouse was burned by Brandt and his savages in the historic raid of\r\nJuly, 1779.\r\n\r\nThe Van Etten schoolhouse, from which the teacher, Jeremiah Van\r\nAuken, was taken out and cruelly murdered in the same raid, was\r\nlocated on the old Levi Van Etten farm, afterwards owned by Mark\r\nVan Etten, on the east side of the Neversink River about one-fourth\r\nof a mile north of Black Rock cut on the Erie.\r\n\r\nThe forts mentioned in the early annals gather about themselves most\r\nof the traditions of Indian attack. In the upper neighborhood there\r\nwas one at the house of Jacob Rutsen De Witt. This was near\r\nCuddebackville, on the west side of the Neversink. Another fort was\r\nat the Gumaer place, now the Godeffroy estate. The old stone\r\nbuilding is still standing and in excellent preservation.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts of incidents occurring during the old French War, it\r\nis stated that on one occasion the Indians lay in ambush \"to take the\r\nlower fort at Mr. Westfall's.\" This was probably the old stone house\r\nat Germantown. A local writer says: \"The present structure, rebuilt\r\nin 1793, occupied the site of a fort or blockhouse built anterior to\r\nthe Revolution and occupied as a dwelling and trading post by a\r\nfamily of the name of Haynes, who carried on a thriving trade with\r\nthe Indians for many years.\" Captain Westfall, who married one of Mr.\r\nHaynes's daughters, lived in the house during the Brandt invasion of\r\n1779. He was away on a scouting expedition at the time, and a trusty\r\nNegro buried the valuables and assisted the escape of the captain's\r\nwife to the high hills of the Jersey shore near Carpenter's point.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Brandt's expedition first attacked \"the fort at\r\nMajor Decker's.\" This was on the old George Cuddeback place on the\r\neast side of the Neversink River, about three miles from Port Jervis.\r\nAnother fort was near the residence of the late James D. Swartwout.\r\nStill another is mentioned by Peter E. Gumaer \"at the house of Peter\r\nCoykendall, in the present village of Port Jervis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF GOSHEN.\r\n\r\nBy George F. Gregg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthwest, sixty miles by rail from New York City, sixteen miles in\r\nan air line west from the Hudson River, lies Goshen, the county seat\r\nof Orange County, located in the geographical center of that civic\r\nsub-division. The town derives its name from the Goshen of Biblical\r\nmemory. Almost two centuries ago the first of the settlers came. The\r\nnative beauty of the place appealed to the calm and dauntless spirits\r\nof these men, who had plunged boldly into a benighted and unknown\r\ncountry. They stood upon the wooded hills and looked with glad eyes\r\nupon the fertile, fruitful valley. All around about them lay the land\r\nof their desire, and they called it Goshen, the \"promised land\" of\r\nthe Scriptures.\r\n\r\nThe town, which was first known by this name in 1714, was originally\r\nmuch larger than at present. Its boundaries were defined by law in\r\n1788. A part of Hamptonburgh was taken from it in 1830, and a part of\r\nChester in 1845. Other changes of boundaries were made at different\r\ntimes, as recited elsewhere in this article. It has a population\r\nto-day in town and village slightly in excess of 5,000.\r\n\r\nThe section is known for the great fertility of its soil. It is in\r\nthe heart of a noted dairying country, and as long ago as\r\nRevolutionary days Goshen butter was widely famed. Butter making has\r\npractically ceased now, but the milk production is large. The town\r\nis also noted for the onions and celery raised on its black dirt\r\nmeadows, as well as for the grass crops grown on its fertile farms.\r\n\r\nThe village is located on the main line of the Erie Railroad, and has\r\ndirect connection with New England cities by way of the N. Y.,\r\nN. H. & H. R. R. It is also the terminus of the Montgomery & Erie,\r\nthe Goshen & Deckertown, and the Lehigh & New England Railroads.\r\nIt is handsomely laid out with broad, well-kept and well-shaded\r\nstreets of smooth macadam. It has three public school buildings, and\r\nGarr Institute, a parochial school, conducted under the direction of\r\nSt. John's Church. It has six churches: The First Presbyterian,\r\norganized in 1720; St. James' Episcopal, dating back to 1796;\r\nSt. John the Evangelist, Roman Catholic, founded in 1820; the\r\nMethodist Episcopal, organized in 1847; the A. U. M. P. Church, and\r\nOlivet Chapel, a Presbyterian colored mission. It has two national\r\nbanks and a savings bank, two newspapers, gas and electric lighting\r\ncompanies, a waterworks system, and first-class hotels and clubs. Its\r\nfire department is made up of three volunteer companies, Cataract\r\nEngine and Hose, organized in 1843; Dikeman Hose, organized in 1872,\r\nand Minisink Hook and Ladder, organized in 1906, upon the disbanding\r\nof Elliott H. and L., which was organized in 1871. Leading to the\r\nvillage from almost every direction are improved roads, maintained\r\nunder State supervision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George F. Gregg.]\r\n\r\nNo mention of the town, past or present, would be complete, without\r\nreference to the trotting-horse industry. It began in 1803, when\r\nImp. Messenger, acknowledged head of the trotting family, stood at\r\nGoshen Down through all the years trotting horses were bred and\r\nraised there, and even in this day and generation the horse\r\ninterests are chief among the interests of the town. In the center of\r\nthe village is located the finest half-mile track in the country and\r\nmany famous horses are trained there.\r\n\r\nEvery foot of its ground is historic. In the far-gone years red men\r\nroamed its landscape and predatory beasts lurked in the shadows of\r\nits primeval timber lands. It was one of the early settlements made\r\non that vast tract to which Governor Nicolls referred when he wrote\r\nin 1664: \"The lands which I intend shall be first planted are those\r\nupon the west bank of Hudson's River.\" Shortly after the first\r\nsettlement a bounty was placed on wolves and the Governor recommended\r\nits payment to the House of Lords. Chapter 302 of the laws of 1715,\r\nwas an act for the destroying of wolves in this section. This act\r\nexpired July 21, 1717, and on October 29, 1742, the General Assembly\r\nfound it necessary to pass a law placing a bounty of a shilling and\r\nsixpence on \"wolves, whelps and panthers.\"\r\n\r\nNoah Webster, of dictionary renown, taught the first academy in\r\nGoshen. Dewitt Clinton attended school there, and William H. Seward\r\nstudied law in the office of Judge Duer. The first newspaper of the\r\ncounty, _The Goshen Repository,_ was published at Goshen in 1788, by\r\nDavid Mandeville.\r\n\r\nIn the article which follows, the writer has endeavored to furnish a\r\nconcise history in limited space. As nearly as possible, events are\r\nset down in chronological order. Much of interest concerning the town\r\nthat is based only upon tradition is left out and the space devoted\r\nto historical facts that can be authenticated and verified by\r\nrecords, maps, parchments and the writings of earlier and wiser men.\r\n\r\nThe County of Orange dates its existence by legal enactment from\r\nOctober 1, 1691, in the third year of the reign of King William and\r\nQueen Mary, and in the administration of Henry Sloughter, Esq.,\r\nGovernor. The First Assembly convened the 9th of April that year. On\r\nOctober 1 it passed an act, Chapter 17, entitled \"An Act to divide\r\nthe province and dependencies into shires and counties.\" Section VII\r\nof this act provided: \"The County of Orange to begin from the limits\r\nor bounds of East and West Jersey, on the west side of Hudson's\r\nRiver, along the said river to the Murderer's Creek, or bounds of the\r\nCounty of Ulster; and westward into the woods as far as the Delaware\r\nRiver.\"\r\n\r\nChapter 94, which became a law October 18, 1701, added to the lands\r\nembraced in the county those of \"Magachemeck and Great and Little\r\nMinisinck.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 12, 1709, during the administration of Richard\r\nIngoldsby, Esq., Lieutenant-Governor, the Eighth Assembly passed an\r\nact, Chapter, 202, \"to determine, settle and ascertain the bounds and\r\nlimits of the County of Orange.\" This act repealed the clause added\r\nby Chapter 94, and fixed the bounds as follows: \"That the County of\r\nOrange shall extend from the limits and confines of the Province of\r\nNew Jersey on the west side of Hudson's River, along the said river\r\nto the line of the County of Ulster, and westward so far as the\r\nDelaware River.\"\r\n\r\nThe county derives its name from the Prince of Orange, who married\r\nMary, and came to the throne in 1689, under the name of King William.\r\n\r\nGoshen is a part of the tract known as the Wawayanda Patent, acquired\r\nof the red men by John Bridges & Company, on March 5, 1703, and\r\nconfirmed by royal decree of Queen Anne. Twelve Indian sachems\r\nconveyed the land. They were Rapingonick, Wawastawa, Moghopuck,\r\nComelawaw, Nanawitt, Arawinack, Rombout, Claus, Chouckhass,\r\nChingapaw, Oshasquememus and Quilapaw. The patent was granted April\r\n29. There were twelve patentees, namely, John Bridges, LL.D.,\r\nHendrick Tenyck, Derrick Vanderburgh, John Chotwell, Christopher\r\nDenn, Lancaster Syms, Daniel Herran, Philip Rockeby, John Meredith,\r\nBenjamin Aske, Peter Matthews, and Christian Christianse. The grant\r\nwas supposed to contain 60,000 acres, but surveys later showed that\r\nit contained nearly 160,000. These twelve patentees held the land in\r\ncommon until 1706, when it was divided into twelve parts. Only eight\r\nof the original shareholders retained their interests at that time,\r\nBridges having died in 1704, and others having transferred their\r\nholdings.\r\n\r\nThe tract was unoccupied until 1712, when Christopher Denn made\r\nsettlement upon it, to be followed shortly by Benjamin Aske; Daniel\r\nCromline, who became a shareholder in 1704; Christian Snedeker, of\r\nLong Island; Samuel Staats, who came into record as a thirteenth\r\nshareholder in 1713; and John Everett and Samuel Clowes, who in 1714,\r\nacquired a tract equal to four of the thirteen shares. The township\r\nof Goshen came that year, and the precinct of Goshen, comprising the\r\noutlying settlements came later, and remained until 1788 when the\r\ntownship was expanded to take its place.\r\n\r\nIn 1712, Christopher Denn, a carpenter by trade and resident of New\r\nYork City, paid a visit to the patent and determined to make a\r\nsettlement upon it. He and his wife, Elizabeth, were childless, but\r\nhad adopted an orphan girl, Sarah Wells.\r\n\r\nDenn selected a spot along the Otterkill, as it is now known, about\r\ntwo miles or more from the present village. He returned to New York,\r\nequipped an expedition, which he sent up the Hudson River in charge\r\nof his adopted daughter, accompanied by two white men and some\r\nIndians whom he had taken to New York when returning from his first\r\nvisit. A raft was used for the voyage and a landing safely made near\r\nCornwall. The journey to the spot selected by Denn was through a\r\ntrackless forest, but was made without mishap and a rough cabin was\r\nbuilt. After the starting of the expedition Denn was remorseful\r\nbecause he sent the girl into unknown dangers, and within a short\r\ntime he started for the new settlement, with his wife. The journey\r\nwas made on horseback. They arrived safely and took up permanent\r\nresidence there.\r\n\r\nIt appears from an old map that Denn's share of the patent was a\r\ntriangular tract, containing about 2,000 acres. The presence of this\r\nfamily soon brought other settlers and the woodman's axe resounded\r\nfar and near. The merciless push of immigration began and the native\r\nred men were driven further into the wilderness. In the course of a\r\nfew years Sarah Wells became the wife of William Bull, of\r\nWolverhampton, England, who came to this country and was employed by\r\nDaniel Cromline in 1716 to build the masonry of a dwelling, later\r\nknown to fame for nearly a century as the Greycourt House. History\r\nrecords this as the first marriage within the limits of the town of\r\nGoshen.\r\n\r\nThe lands in the vicinity of the present village were settled to\r\nsome extent soon after Denn's arrival. There were on record deeds\r\nshowing the conveyance of lots in the village in 1714. On July 10,\r\n1721, a deed in trust was made to John Yelverton by John Everett,\r\nJohn Carpenter, John Gale, William Ludlum, Nathaniel Higby, John\r\nCarpenter, Jr., G. McNish, James Sandys, Thomas Watson, Hope Rodes,\r\nJohn Holly, James Jackson, Isaac Finch, Solomon Carpenter, John\r\nBeers, Michael Dunning, Samuel Seely, John Nichols, William Jackson,\r\nAlexander Moore, John Knapp, Samuel Webb, John Alsop and Richard\r\nHalsted, setting forth that a conveyance had been \"lately\" made to\r\nJohn Everett and Samuel Clowes, giving them one-sixth part of all the\r\nlands for the purpose of laying out a township, establishing a church\r\nand settling a minister.\r\n\r\nThe Goshen Presbyterian Church was organized in 1720, and Rev. John\r\nBradner, to whom more extended reference is made later in this\r\narticle, became its pastor in 1721. Two hundred acres of land were\r\ndeeded to him on April 17, 1722, and recorded at the request of his\r\nwidow on April 8, 1742. In 1724 the erection of a house of worship\r\nwas begun on the spot where now stands the court house. The first\r\ncourt was convened in Goshen in 1727, and on December 16, of that\r\nyear an act was passed providing for the building of a court house\r\nand jail, which were erected and completed in 1740, on the site of\r\nthe present Orange Hotel. On October 24, 1754, the General Assembly\r\nappropriated 100 pounds for an addition to it, and in 1775 it was\r\ndemolished and a new one built at a point where now stands the\r\ncounty clerk's office. The arms of King George III were placed upon\r\nits front, but were torn down by indignant citizens.\r\n\r\nA schoolhouse was built in 1801 on the church plot, the same spot\r\nwhere the public school building on Greenwich street now stands. Here\r\nNoah Webster taught for a time before he published his first\r\ndictionary in 1806.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jno. Pleovert]\r\n\r\nGoshen, after its original settlement, soon became the most important\r\nand populous district of the county, and a census taken in 1738\r\nshowed a total of 319 males above the age of ten. These were\r\nstirring times for the people and most of the affairs were of a\r\nwarlike nature. There was frequent trouble with the Indians. The\r\nfrontier was only four miles away. Block houses were built at\r\nDolsontown and Scotchtown, and tradition has it that a block house\r\nonce stood back of the present race course on the property known\r\nto-day as the Parkway Farm. In those days the settlers west of the\r\nWallkill made Goshen their rendezvous when Indian raids were feared.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of George II, when Hon. George Clinton was Governor, the\r\nGeneral Assembly passed an act to enable the inhabitants of Goshen in\r\nthe County of Orange to elect two additional constables. This act\r\nexplained that the inhabitants of the Precinct of Goshen had liberty\r\nto elect only one constable and as the precinct had considerably\r\nincreased in numbers of inhabitants and settlements, it was\r\nnecessary that an increased number be elected. The act was passed\r\nDecember 17, 1743, and provided that one of the constables \"be\r\nelected and chosen from and out of such of the inhabitants as have\r\nhabitations in the south part of Goshen, commonly called Wawayanda,\r\nand the other from and out of such of the inhabitants as have\r\nhabitations northward near the meeting house, commonly called the\r\nWater-Side Meeting House.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 21, 1744, the General Assembly passed an act to\r\nauthorize justices of the peace in the counties of Dutchess and\r\nOrange to \"direct so many constables and overseers of the highways to\r\nbe chosen, in the several precincts as to them shall seem meet.\" On\r\nthe same day an act was passed for the relief of the poor in the\r\ncounties of Orange and Suffolk.\r\n\r\n     Covenant Chain Treaty.\r\n\r\nDuring these years the settlers had as allies two tribes of Indians,\r\nsometimes known as the Cashigton Indians, whose principal lodges were\r\nlocated near where now stands the village of Cochecton in Sullivan\r\nCounty, They formed a part of the Lenni Lenape, or Delaware\r\nConfederacy, once powerful, but at that time reduced in numbers. From\r\ntime immemorial Western Orange had been their hunting ground, but\r\nlate in the year 1744 they showed signs of distrust and retired to\r\ntheir lodges on the upper Delaware. The colonists were loath to lose\r\nthese faithful allies, for their withdrawal left the outlying\r\nsettlements on the frontiers exposed to attack of hostile savages,\r\nincited to rapine and murder by the French.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Colonial Government was called to this matter\r\nand Colonel DeKay was ordered to take a party and visit the Indians\r\nin the hope that friendly relations might be restored and the red men\r\ninduced to return to their old hunting grounds. As a result of this\r\nvisit the Indian Treaty of Orange County was enacted and the ceremony\r\nof the Covenant Chain performed at Goshen. Colonel Thomas De Kay took\r\nwith him, upon this expedition, Major Swartwout, Ensign Coleman, Adam\r\nWeisner, who acted as interpreter, Benjamin Thompson, and two\r\nMinisink Indians as guides. The pilgrimage was made in the depth of\r\nwinter. The Indians were found and agreed to come back, claiming that\r\nthey left because they were afraid of the people of Orange County,\r\nwho were always under arms. When it was explained that this was by\r\norder of the Governor and for protection against the French and their\r\nallies, the Indians rejoiced. They explained that they were of two\r\ntribes, using for totems the signs of Minsi, or Wolf, and Uralachtgo,\r\nor Turkey, and that their sachem had recently died. They were about\r\nto choose a new sachem to govern all, and they promised that when he\r\nhad been chosen they would send representatives to make a treaty.\r\nNew Year's Day was fixed upon as the date.\r\n\r\nOn January 3, 1745, two days late, the Wolves and Turkeys, a dozen of\r\nthe head men in all, led by the new sachem, came into the village of\r\nGoshen and marched in savage bravery up its main street. Just where\r\nthe ceremony took place is unknown, but the old manuscript record\r\nsays that the weather was severe, and it is probable that the meeting\r\nwas held in the rude court house. The Indians by their spokesman\r\nexplained that they had brought a Belt of Wampum that friendship and\r\nbrotherhood might be restored. They asked that some one be appointed\r\nto enact with them the ceremony of the Covenant Chain.\r\n\r\nColonel De Kay informed them that the Governor alone had power to make\r\nsuch an appointment and that as there was not time to communicate\r\nwith him, it would be best for the Indians to select a man. They\r\nchose the colonel and he was then chained to them for an hour or more\r\nas a token of their being united again in the bonds of friendship.\r\nSpeeches were made by the Indians and they solemnly pledged\r\nthemselves to be true \"as long as the sun and moon endured,\" and\r\npromised to send in runners at once if they learned of any plots\r\nagainst the English. They also agreed to join in fighting the enemy\r\nand asked that aid be given them in case of attack by the French.\r\nThis was freely promised and while the Colonel was still chained to\r\nthe Indians they gave him the Belt of Wampum to be sent to the\r\nGovernor. The Indians, according to the record, \"again rejoiced with\r\nthree huzzahs and departed very much pleased.\" The Belt of Wampum, so\r\nstates the books of the Lords of Trade and Plantations in London, was\r\ntaken to the Colonial Council in New York by Colonel DeKay a\r\nfortnight later and delivered to the Council, which in turn sent it\r\nto the Governor, who recommended that one be given in return to the\r\nIndians. This was the only occasion on record when the ceremony of\r\nthe Covenant Chain was enacted in Orange County.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Edward Wells.]\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1748, an act was passed by the General Assembly\r\nproviding that \"for the time to come, all elections of representatives\r\nof the County of Orange to serve in the present or any future General\r\nAssembly shall begin and be first opened at the court house in Orange\r\nTown, or at the court house or some other convenient place in the town\r\nof Goshen.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time settlers who had dealings with the sheriff began to\r\nfind considerable fault with the manner in which mileage charges\r\nwere computed. On April 8, 1748, an act was passed providing that for\r\nall writs and process papers served on inhabitants on the north side\r\nof the mountain range called the Highlands, mileage should be\r\ncomputed by the sheriff from the court house in Goshen, and for all\r\npapers served on the south side from the court house in Orange Town.\r\nThe preamble to this act fully explained the situation. It stated:\r\n\"Whereas the County of Orange is very extensive in length, and by\r\nreason of a ridge of mountains across the same, and for the better\r\naccommodation of inhabitants, it was found necessary to have two\r\ncourt houses, the one at Goshen on the north, and the other at\r\nOrange Town on the south thereof; yet by the sheriff having his\r\nresidence sometimes at the one and sometimes at the other extreme of\r\nthe said county, the computation of his fees for mileage in the\r\nservice of writs hath hitherto been made from the place of the\r\nsheriff's abode, which has been found to be very inconvenient and\r\nburdensome to the parties concerned.\"\r\n\r\n    Military Matters.\r\n\r\nWhen the French and Indian War began in 1756 the men of Goshen were\r\ncontinually under arms. The old Journal of the Assembly relates the\r\nservices of Captain George De Kay as express between Goshen and\r\nMinisink. It mentions as his guards Peter Carter, David Benjamin,\r\nPhilip Reid and Francis Armstrong. It tells also of the payment of\r\nnearly 100 pounds to Colonel Vincent Mathews for furnishing guides to\r\nregulars posted at Goshen from October, 1757, to February, 1758, and\r\nrefers to the work of Colonels Clinton and De Kay in laying out block\r\nhouses for the settlers' defense. Mention is also made of the payment\r\nof 56 pounds to Samuel Gale for provisions furnished troops on the\r\nfrontiers near Goshen; and of reimbursing Colonel Benj. Tusten,\r\nCaptain Daniel Case and Captain J. Bull for money advanced in\r\nbuilding block houses Nos. 1 and 2 on the western frontier in\r\nJanuary, 1757.\r\n\r\nIn 1763, Lieutenant-Governor Cadwallader Colden appealed to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for troops to relieve the militia on the borders of\r\nOrange and Ulster which were infested by the enemy. At this time the\r\ntown of Goshen extended from the Hudson to New Jersey. In 1764 a bill\r\nwas passed dividing the precinct of Goshen into two precincts, to be\r\ncalled Goshen and Cornwall. After this division Cornwall embraced the\r\npresent towns of Cornwall, Monroe and Blooming Grove, while Goshen\r\nincluded the present town of Warwick.\r\n\r\nDuring the years prior to the Revolution when the colonists were\r\ngrowing desperate under the exactions of King George, patriotism and\r\nvalor were manifested to a marked degree in Goshen. On June 8, 1775,\r\nover 360 men signed the Revolutionary pledge at Goshen and the name\r\nof Henry Wisner headed the list. The Reverend Nathan Ker, an ardent\r\npatriot, and the fourth pastor of the Goshen Presbyterian Church, who\r\ncame to Goshen in the fall of 1766, and remained until his death,\r\nDecember 14, 1804, on one occasion is said to have dismissed his\r\ncongregation in the midst of a Sunday service to prepare food for a\r\ntroop of horse that had halted on the way to Philadelphia. Once\r\nGeneral George Washington, riding eastward on the Florida road\r\ntowards his headquarters at Newburgh, stopped with his staff to chat\r\nawhile with the children at the old school house near the stone\r\nquarry.\r\n\r\nNOTABLE EARLY RESIDENTS.\r\n\r\nMany of the old families of Goshen to-day are descendants of the\r\npatriots who fought in the colonial service and whose names appear on\r\nthe roster of the Goshen regiment at the battles of Long Island and\r\nWhite Plains, at the struggle in the Highlands, and the capture of\r\nFort Montgomery, as well as in the memorable slaughter of Minisink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frederick W. Duvard]\r\n\r\nThe highway between Goshen and Florida, over which Washington rode,\r\nis a historic thoroughfare and in Revolutionary days was lined with\r\nthe homes of famous men. Goshen was then the stronghold of the Whigs.\r\nIn a stone house nearly opposite the present Sayer homestead, lived\r\nMoses Hatfield, a captain, afterwards a major, in the Goshen\r\nregiment, who was taken prisoner at a night assault on what is now\r\nRandall's Island, on September 23, 1776, and was kept a captive until\r\n1778.\r\n\r\nA little further along the way lived Henry Wisner, the elder. He and\r\nhis son of the same name were makers of powder for the Continental\r\nArmy at Phillipsburg, between the highway as it now stands and the\r\ngrist mill near by. Traces of the old raceway and mill can still be\r\nseen. Another on the opposite side of the stream, and one at\r\nCraigville, operated in conjunction with John Carpenter, were also\r\nerected by Henry Wisner. The Sons of the Revolution arranged some\r\nyears ago to mark the site of the Phillipsburg powder mill by an\r\nhistorical tablet.\r\n\r\nHenry Wisner stood foremost among those who advocated the\r\nindependence of the colonies. He represented Orange County in the\r\nContinental Congress which declared that \"these States are, and of\r\nright ought to be, free.\" His son Gabriel, hardly past his majority,\r\nwas slain in the slaughter of Minisink. On the 16th of August, 1774,\r\nHenry Wisner was chosen as one of the delegates to represent Orange\r\nCounty in the Continental Congress held in Philadelphia in September\r\nof that year. The election was by the committee of the county held at\r\nthe house of Stephen Slot and the purpose was for the delegate to\r\nattend at Philadelphia \"to consult on proper measures to be taken for\r\nprocuring the redress of our grievances.\"\r\n\r\nA question was raised as to the regularity of this election and a\r\nmeeting of the inhabitants of the precincts of Goshen and Cornwall\r\nwas held at Chester on September 3, 1774, at which Henry Wisner was\r\nchosen to go to Philadelphia \"in order to meet the rest of the\r\ndelegates and consult on proper measures to be taken with respect to\r\nthe claims made by the British Parliament of taxing America in all\r\ncases whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam Wickham was a prominent citizen of Goshen, and his attitude\r\nwas one of extreme loyalty to the crown. With other adherents of the\r\nking he attempted to set aside the election of Wisner. The\r\ncorrespondence, which still exists, shows that political feeling was\r\nvery bitter. The scheme came to naught and Wisner took his seat. In\r\nApril, 1776, he was elected by a convention held at New York City, as\r\na delegate to the Second Continental Congress in which he took part,\r\nleaving it for the purpose of manufacturing powder for Washington's\r\ntattered army.\r\n\r\nMr. Wisner's signature may still be found in the list at Carpenter's\r\nHall in Philadelphia. He continued in Congress until the memorable\r\n2nd of July, 1776, when the \"Resolution of Independency\" {_sic_} was\r\npassed. He was heartily in favor of the measure and remained for the\r\npurpose of casting his vote for its final passage, had the Provincial\r\nCongress of New York given such instructions to its delegates.\r\nTradition affirms that he actually did vote for the \"independency\"\r\nthat day. He was not present to sign the Declaration. He had proposed\r\nin Congress \"a method for the manufacture of saltpeter and gunpowder\"\r\nwhich had been approved, and in agreement with which he was requested\r\nor appointed to build works and prepare powder for the \"Army of the\r\nNorth.\" To do this he left Philadelphia on the third of July and\r\napplied himself to the making of powder. For three years, and until\r\nhis mill was burned and his fortune exhausted, he continued to supply\r\npowder to the American forts and thus beyond any man in the\r\nContinental Congress of 1776 contributed to his country's triumph.\r\n\r\nOn the square at St. James' Place in the village of Goshen stands a\r\nmonument of native Pochuck granite erected to the memory of Henry\r\nWisner by his great granddaughter, Mrs. Frances Wisner Murray, widow\r\nof Ambrose Spencer Murray, of Goshen. The monument was dedicated on\r\nJuly 22, 1897, by Dr. John H. Thompson, who presided and Harrison W.\r\nNenny, Esq., who made the dedicatory address.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the residence of Henry Wisner, and separated from it by\r\nwhat is now known as Steward's lane, was the home of John Steward,\r\nan ardent patriot. He was one of two brothers, John and Walter\r\nStewart, or Steward, the name having been spelled both ways, who came\r\nfrom Ireland to New England about 1740. Walter settled in Rhode\r\nIsland, where he started a snuff-mill and became the father of\r\nGilbert Stuart, the noted portrait painter, whose unfinished picture\r\nof Washington is the likeness that the world knows best to-day.\r\nGilbert after reaching manhood, wrote his name Stuart, because by\r\nreason of the fact that his ancestry was by tradition connected with\r\nthe Jacobite cause, he had a great admiration for \"Bonny Prince\r\nCharlie.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. R. Varcoe, D.D.S.]\r\n\r\nThe tradition was that, at the time of one of the early Jacobite\r\nrisings, a nurse in charge of two young children appeared in Belfast,\r\nIreland. They came from Scotland and the woman immediately on\r\narriving fell ill of small-pox and died refusing to tell anything\r\nabout the children except that their names were John and Walter\r\nStewart, and that they were the sons of a man of rank who would soon\r\ncome for them. She had with her no money but some fine jewels, no one\r\never came to claim the children, but as it is recorded in history\r\nthat some Jacobite families are known to have been exterminated in\r\ntheir bloody and unfortunate battles, this may have been the fate of\r\nthe relatives of these boys, too young to tell anything about\r\nthemselves. They were brought up by a man, appointed their guardian.\r\nHe treated them harshly and as soon as grown they left him and came\r\nto try their fortune in a new land. John first acquired some property\r\nin Boston, which he left in his will to his son Nathan, but soon came\r\nto Goshen and settled there, buying in 1744 eighty acres of land,\r\n\"and the houses thereon\" from William Jayne. From this it appears\r\nthat the Steward house may have been erected previous to 1744, but\r\n\"houses thereon\" may have been a mere legal term, and the house was\r\nprobably built by John Steward. It is certain, however, that it has\r\nbeen standing since 1744. He bought more land, about 120 acres in\r\nall, at a later date. To farming John Steward joined the occupation\r\nof blacksmith, erecting a little to the left of his house a forge,\r\nwhich was in operation as early as 1758, the family having still in\r\ntheir possession, a deed of sale bearing that date of a slave named\r\nTite, warranted to be a good blacksmith. Later at this forge, John\r\nSteward II, during the Revolutionary war made sabers and bayonets for\r\nthe Continental Army.\r\n\r\nJohn Steward I, married Elizabeth Bradner, the daughter of Rev. John\r\nBradner, first settled clergyman in Goshen. As John Bradner was the\r\nfather of nine children, viz., Calvin, John, Benoni, Gilbert,\r\nSusanna, Mary, Sarah, Christian and Elizabeth, and to him many\r\nfamilies in Orange County trace their descent, the following may be\r\nthought worthy of record. When a young divinity student in Edinburgh,\r\nScotland, John Bradner was employed by a gentleman called Colvill, a\r\nHuguenot refugee, as a tutor to his sons. His daughter Christiana\r\nshared her brothers' studies and she and the tutor fell in love with\r\neach other, but Colvill thought the tutor no match for his daughter,\r\nand told her if she married him he would never speak to her again.\r\nShe put love before duty and having married John Bradner they sailed\r\nfor America. The voyage occupied six months. Violent storms in which\r\nthe ship nearly foundered were encountered. These Mrs. Bradner\r\nthought were sent by Heaven to punish her for her disregard of her\r\nfather's wishes. Rev. John Bradner received the degree M.A. from\r\nthe University of Edinburgh, February 23rd, 1712, was licensed to\r\npreach March, 1714, ordained May 6, 1715, pastor of Cold Spring\r\nPresbyterian Church, Cape May, N. J., before being called to the\r\nchurch in Goshen, 1721. He died 1732. His widow died 1759. She was\r\nwell educated in the classics and assisted in preparing her son, Rev.\r\nBenoni, for Princeton College. He graduated 1755, was settled in\r\nJamaica, L. I., 1760, and two years after was called to Church Nine\r\nPartners, Dutchess County. There is now in the possession of Mrs.\r\nM. H. C. Gardner, of Middletown, a piece of a quilt brought from\r\nScotland by Mrs. John Bradner. The colors of the design, birds,\r\nfruit and flowers, are as bright as though it was new. John\r\nSteward I had eight children and their mother used to relate with\r\npride that never once during their infancy or childhood was she\r\nobliged by reason of the illness of one of them to strike a light\r\nduring the night. John Steward I died in 1770, of a fever then\r\nepidemic. In his will he left to his widow, as long as she remained\r\nhis widow, the use of the best room and the \"salon\" room. The small\r\nadjoining room, now a store closet, was her prayer closet, where she\r\nused to retire to pray, as was the good custom of those times.\r\n\r\nHer eldest son, John Steward II, although holding no commission in\r\nthe Continental Army was an ardent patriot, mention being made in\r\n_Rivington's New York Gazette,_ the Tory organ, that \"rebellion in\r\nOrange County was continually fomented by those two firebrands,\r\nSquire Steward and Old Wisner,\" the latter being Henry Wisner, member\r\nof the Continental Congress and John Steward's friend and neighbor.\r\n\r\nJohn Steward II, who was thirty years younger than Henry Wisner, was\r\na justice of the peace, and a number of Hessian prisoners passing\r\nsouthward through Goshen, probably after the battle of Saratoga,\r\nwere quartered over night at his house. The common soldiers slept in\r\nthe barn, but the officers, of whom there were several, were\r\naccommodated in the house and on leaving the next morning told Mrs.\r\nSteward that the coffee made by her black cook was the best they had\r\ntasted since leaving Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Alfred Neafie.]\r\n\r\nIn a house that stood about 100 feet east of the present residence of\r\nCampbell Steward, Esq., lived General Reuben Hopkins, whose son,\r\nHanibal, married Elizabeth Steward, daughter of John Steward II.\r\nGeneral Hopkins's portrait and his appointment as attorney-at-law\r\ndated 1771 and signed by Lord Dunmore, now hang on the walls of the\r\nSteward house, which contains other objects of interest, among which\r\nmay be mentioned an original broadside of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence addressed to John Steward, Esq., his commission as\r\nMajor No. 1 of the regiment of militia in the County of Orange,\r\nsigned by Geo. Clinton in 1798, and a bag of old counterfeit silver\r\nSpanish dollars. A band of counterfeiters was arrested in Orange\r\nCounty about the time of the Revolution and they were tried at\r\nGoshen, their judges, among whom was Judge Steward, keeping some of\r\nthe coins as curiosities. In the house can also be seen a small stone\r\nhammer presented to the wife of John Steward I, as a token of\r\nfriendship by a member of a band of Indians who, at the time Steward\r\nsettled in Goshen, and for some years after, lived in a hickory grove\r\nat the rear of his house. His family always made a point of\r\nmaintaining friendly relations with their savage neighbors, and were\r\nnever troubled by them, although once during the French and Indian\r\nWar on an alarm being given that Indians on the war path were\r\napproaching Goshen, the family fled to the cedar swamp. It is said\r\nthat on leaving they looked back for what they feared might be a\r\nlast look at their house, but the alarm proved a false one. Goshen\r\nwas spared an Indian massacre and they returned to find their house\r\nstill standing. The main body of the house, with some minor\r\nalterations, is the same to-day as it was in those old Indian days,\r\nits cedar shingles, oak beams and large stone chimneys seeming still\r\nsound and strong. The house being too small for modern requirements,\r\ntwo wings have been added at different times and the chimney tops\r\nrebuilt, but care has been taken to preserve as far as possible every\r\nantique feature of the house in its original condition.\r\n\r\nDuring Revolutionary days the inhabitants of Orange County were\r\nterrorized by the depredations of Claudius Smith, a notorious outlaw,\r\nand his gang of ruffians, who were known as cowboys. Smith was\r\nindicted on three charges, one of which was the murder of Major\r\nStrong. Rewards were offered by Governor Clinton, and Smith was taken\r\ncaptive at Smithtown, L. I., by Major Brush. He was given into the\r\ncustody of Colonel Isaac Nichol, sheriff of Orange County, and on\r\nJanuary 22, 1779, was publicly executed at the west corner of church\r\npark in Goshen, with two other criminals, De La Alar, a burglar, and\r\nGordon, a horse thief. On the gallows near the same spot forty years\r\nlater two others were publicly put to death for murder.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF MINISINK.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1779, occurred the battle of Minisink, in which the\r\nGoshen regiment, under Colonel Tusten, met almost complete\r\nannihilation at the hands of nearly 500 Indians and Tories under\r\nJoseph Brant, the half-breed chieftain, who was known as\r\nThayendanegea, the Scourge, and held a colonel's commission from\r\nGeorge III. The Goshen regiment marched against Brant's forces to\r\navenge a raid made by Brant upon the settlers near Minisink on the\r\n20th of the month. They were joined by a small reinforcement, under\r\nColonel Hathorn, of the Warwick regiment, and the latter assumed\r\ncommand. While marching along the west bank of the Delaware at nine\r\no'clock on the morning of July 22, the Indians were discovered about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile away and Colonel Hathorn hastened his\r\ncommand in pursuit. Brant, taking advantage of intervening woods and\r\nhills made a detour which enabled him to gain the rear of the\r\nattacking party, and in the battle which followed the savages\r\ncompletely routed the small force that opposed them. The colonists\r\nhad little ammunition and this was soon exhausted. A part of them\r\nfled, and more were killed in flight than in battle. Colonel Tusten,\r\nwho was a skillful surgeon, dressed the wounds of his men, and refused\r\nto abandon them, staying on the field until he fell. Of the eighty\r\nmen in the engagement, 44 were killed outright and others died later\r\nof their wounds.\r\n\r\nColonel Benjamin Tusten, who was a physician and surgeon by\r\nprofession, came originally from Southold, L. I., in 1746, at the age\r\nof three years. His parents located on the banks of the Otterkill on\r\nthe patent granted to Elizabeth Denn. His father, Benjamin Tusten,\r\nwas appointed one of the judges of the courts of the county and also\r\na colonel in the Orange County regiment of militia. The son,\r\nBenjamin, was sent to an academy at Jamaica, L. I., and at the age of\r\nnineteen returned to Goshen and studied medicine with Doctor Thomas\r\nWiskham. He afterwards studied in Newark, N. J., and New York City,\r\nreturning in 1769 to practice medicine in Goshen, where two other\r\nphysicians, Doctor John Gale and Doctor Pierson, had already located.\r\nHe was very successful and was widely known as a surgeon. He married\r\nMiss Brown, by whom he had two sons and three daughters. In 1777 he\r\nwas appointed lieutenant colonel of the Goshen regiment of militia\r\nunder General Allison, and in 1778 was appointed surrogate of Orange\r\nCounty, which office he held when he lost his life at Minisink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alexander C. Sutherland]\r\n\r\nCaptain John Wood, of Colonel Tusten's regiment, was captured in the\r\nbattle of Minisink, his life being spared by Brant, who in the thick\r\nof the battle, thought he saw Wood give a masonic sign. Wood was\r\ntaken captive and transported to Canada. He left a journal of events\r\nfollowing the battle which throws considerable light on the life and\r\ncharacter of Brant.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1822, by the influence of Dr. David R. Arnell of Goshen,\r\na monument was erected in the village to the memory of the men who\r\nfell at Minisink. It was set up over the bones of the patriots which\r\nhad been gathered from the battlefield forty-three years after the\r\nmassacre. On July 22, 1862. a more pretentious monument was dedicated\r\nand unveiled, provision for the cost of the same having been made in\r\nthe will of Dr. Merritt H. Cash, of Minisink.\r\n\r\nGoshen village was originally laid out in four lots of eighty acres\r\neach. Its original boundaries are not definitely known, as a\r\ndisastrous fire in 1843 destroyed the town clerk's office, burning up\r\nthe map of the town and village lots, together with deeds dating from\r\n1714. After these records had been destroyed a new charter was\r\ngranted on April 18, 1843, fixing the boundaries of the village,\r\nwhich remained under this charter until 1878, when it was abandoned\r\nand the village reorganized under the general act. Goshen was\r\nincorporated a town on March 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nAt one time Orange County embraced nearly all the southern part of\r\nNew York, bordering on the Hudson River. Courts were then held at\r\nOrange Town, now in Rockland County. In 1827 they were removed to\r\nGoshen. In 1839 the board of supervisors made application to the\r\nLegislature to erect a new court house at Goshen. There was\r\nconsiderable opposition from the southern end of the county, which\r\nwas anxious to secure increased judicial conveniences. As a result,\r\nthe Legislature effected a compromise, making Goshen and Newburgh\r\njoint capitals, and in April, 1841, passed an act authorizing the\r\nbuilding of a court house and jail at Goshen and a court house and\r\ncells at Newburgh.\r\n\r\nIN THE CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1862, President Lincoln issued a call for 300,000\r\nvolunteers, and Governor Morgan appointed a military committee for\r\nOrange County. Hon. Ambrose S. Murray was the Goshen member. As a\r\nresult of this call the 124th Regiment, afterwards famed as the\r\n\"Orange Blossoms\" was organized. During the period of organization it\r\nwas encamped at Goshen, where Murray avenue is now located.\r\nEnlistments came rapidly and by August 23 it was ready for the field.\r\n\r\nThe military committee recommended A. Van Home Ellis, of New Windsor,\r\nfor colonel of the regiment and he accepted the commission. Henry S.\r\nMurray was made captain of Co. B, which was composed of Goshen men.\r\nOn August 26, 1862, the regiment was presented with a stand of\r\ncolors by the women of Orange County. Hon. Charles H. Winfield made\r\nthe presentation speech. Afterwards, on behalf of the women of\r\nWawayanda, Miss Charlotte E. Coulter presented the regiment with a\r\npair of embroidered silk guidons.\r\n\r\nOn-Friday, September 5, the regiment was mustered in and on the\r\nfollowing day departed for the front. It fought in many engagements\r\nfrom Manassas Gap to Lee's surrender at Appomattox, and was disbanded\r\nat Washington's headquarters in Newburgh, June 16, 1865, leaving a\r\nrecord of 208 service dead and 609 casualties in action.\r\n\r\nWhen the Civil War was at its height and drafts were necessary to\r\nsupply the depleted ranks of the Union Army, one interesting\r\nincident took place at Goshen. The provost marshal general had\r\nordered a draft for the Eleventh District, comprising the counties of\r\nOrange and Sullivan, calling for 1,932 men, with 50% added, making a\r\ntotal of 2,898. This draft was to begin at Goshen on Wednesday\r\nmorning, October 7, 1863. Trouble was feared by certain of the\r\nleading citizens, and they asked that troops be sent to the village\r\nto prevent rioting. Accordingly on Tuesday evening, October 6, the\r\nFifth Wisconsin Volunteers, under Colonel Allen, arrived in town. The\r\nregiment, which originally numbered 1,300, had been reduced by hard\r\nservice to 450 men. They made their camp on the elevation which is\r\nnow Prospect avenue, and during the night, trained their cannon to\r\ncover the points where crowds would gather in case of rioting. The\r\ndrawing began on Wednesday and lasted until Saturday and there was no\r\nserious disorder. The names were drawn from the wheel by Gabriel\r\nColeman, an aged blind man of the village. Orange County's quota was\r\n2,131, and Sullivan's 767. Goshen furnished 62, of whom three were\r\ncolored men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D. Jackson Steward]\r\n\r\nA table of military statistics compiled just before the close of the\r\nwar showed that Goshen had furnished men as follows at the\r\nGovernment's call: 30 men in 1861; 113 men in 1862; 104 men in 1863;\r\n51 men in 1864.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, September 5, 1907, there was dedicated at Goshen a\r\nmonument to the service dead of the 124th Regiment. The monument,\r\nwhich weighs nineteen tons, is a bronze figure, \"The Standard\r\nBearer,\" designed by Theo. Alice Ruggles Kitson, a noted sculptress.\r\nThe figure, eighteen feet in height, stands upon a pedestal of Stony\r\nCreek granite, fourteen feet high. The monument was presented to the\r\npeople of Orange County by Hon. Thomas W. Bradley, of Walden, N. Y.,\r\nMember of Congress from the Twentieth New York District, in memory of\r\nhis comrades who died in the service of their country. Mr. Bradley\r\nenlisted as a private in the \"Orange Blossoms,\" was promoted to\r\ncaptain, and brevetted major for meritorious service, and was awarded\r\nthe Congressional Medal of Honor for gallantry at Chancellorsville,\r\nMay 3, 1863, when he volunteered in response to a call, and alone,\r\nin the face of a heavy fire of musketry and canister, went across the\r\nfield of battle and procured ammunition for his comrades.\r\n\r\nThe presentation was made by Colonel Charles H. Weygant, who\r\ncommanded the regiment after the commander, Colonel F. M. Cummins,\r\nfell wounded. It was accepted for the people by Mr. John J. E.\r\nHarrison, chairman of the board of supervisors, a veteran of Co. B,\r\n56th Regiment, U. S. V., who was wounded at Devon's Neck, S. C.,\r\nDecember 7, 1864, and who rendered before and after that time valiant\r\nservice in the Union's cause. It was accepted also by Captain Robert\r\nB. Hock, who was the village president, and was then serving his\r\neighteenth consecutive term in that office. He also had been a\r\nsoldier with a long and honorable record. He enlisted in the regular\r\narmy as a bugler, some years before the war, and was assigned to the\r\nTenth U. S. Infantry, and sent to Fort Snelling, Minn. He took part\r\nin many expeditions against the Mormons, under General Albert Sidney\r\nJohnson, afterwards the confederate general killed at Shiloh. Mr.\r\nHock was later sent to the scene of the Mount Meadow massacre and\r\nfought in the battle of Ash Hollow under General Hardy. In 1860 he\r\nwas a pony express rider when Denver was only a tented village. After\r\nFort Sumter was fired on, his old commander General Tracy, asked him\r\nto drill recruits at Staten Island. He did this and later performed\r\nthe same service at Washington. In 1861 he was commissioned\r\nlieutenant of Co. E, 12th New York Cavalry, and in 1863 was made\r\ncaptain of Co. F. He was on the Burnside expedition, at Ball's Bluff\r\nand in the second battle of Bull Run. On April 17, 1864, he was taken\r\nprisoner at Plymouth, N. C., and confined for three weeks in\r\nAndersonville, four months at Macon, one month at Savannah, and one\r\nmonth at Charleston. With six brother officers he escaped from prison\r\nat Columbia, S. C, and was tracked by bloodhounds. All the others\r\nwere recaptured, but he, after suffering terribly by privation and\r\nexposure, reached the Union lines and was cared for by the Third\r\nTennessee, until able to report to General Dix in New York. In 1865\r\nin a skirmish with General Bragg's troops his horse was shot from\r\nunder him, and he was caught by Bragg's men and sent to Danville, Va.\r\nHe made a break for liberty and escaped to the brush, rejoining the\r\nUnion forces just before Lee's surrender. At Bentonville, in a\r\ncavalry charge, his horse was killed and he was thrown among the\r\nrebel infantry and captured. The same night he escaped, covering\r\nhimself with dead leaves, and reporting at his company headquarters\r\nin the morning. His comrade in rebel prisons, Lieutenant A. Cooper,\r\ndedicated a book of his experiences to Captain Hock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles E. Stickney.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF GREENVILLE.\r\n\r\nBy Charles E. Stickney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of acres of land in the town assessed in 1865, was 18,287,\r\nat a valuation of $385,600. Personal property $49,850. The number of\r\nacres assessed in 1907 is 17,829 at a valuation of $269,485. Personal\r\nproperty, $19,850. A loss in 42 years of 458 acres of land, $116,115\r\nin assessed valuation of real estate, and of $30,000 assessed\r\npersonal property. The town expenses (town audits) were $619.37,\r\nbesides $807 for roads and bridges.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the town had a population of 1,218. Ten years later it had a\r\npopulation of 1,147; while in 1905 it had only 672 inhabitants,\r\na loss of nearly half compared with its first-named census.\r\n\r\nThe name was undoubtedly suggested by the beautiful green summer\r\nverdure the eastern part of the town exhibits, lying to the sun on\r\nthe eastern declivity of Shawangunk mountain.\r\n\r\nIts boundaries are: Beginning at the corner of the town of Wawayanda\r\nline with that of Mount Hope, thence almost due west along the Mount\r\nHope line to that of the town of Deer Park; thence along the Deer\r\nPark town line southwest to the New Jersey State line; thence\r\neasterly along the said State line to the corner of the Minisink\r\ntown line; thence northeasterly along the Minisink town line to a\r\npoint on Castle High Hill near South Centerville; thence\r\nnorthwesterly along the town of Wawayanda town line to a corner;\r\nthence northeasterly by north along the said line to the place of\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe first town meeting was held at the house of Jonathan Wood, in\r\nBushville, March 28th, 1854. Bushville then was a village of some\r\nimportance, but since the near advent of railroads its trade has gone\r\nto other places.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe oldest village in the town is no doubt the settlement at Smith's\r\nCorners. It was situated on the road which leads along the eastern\r\nslope of the Shawangunk mountain from Coleville, N. J., to Otisville,\r\nand in early times was a place of some business. Elijah Smith was\r\nits founder about the close of the Revolution. Joseph Smith, justice\r\nof the peace (see Minisink civil list), in 1813 was a noted man in\r\nhis day. After the Goshen and Minisink turnpike road was built, and\r\nlater when (about 1820) a mail route was established through there,\r\nthe post-office was located at a store which stood where the village\r\nof Greenville now is. The post-office was named Minisink, because\r\nthere was somewhere in the State a post-office already known as\r\nGreenville, and this was the nearest post-office to the real\r\nMinisink west of the mountain. Two churches, a store and a hotel are\r\nlocated there. The village of Smith's Corner has this year of 1907\r\nbeen made convenient to travel on account of the new macadam road\r\njust built throughout it from Slate Hill to Carpenter's Point.\r\n\r\nLake Maretange, upon which one of the great land patents (Evans)\r\ncornered in Colonial days, is now known as Binnewater Pond. It covers\r\nabout twenty acres of land, and is now so filled with aquatic\r\ngrowths and mud that it has less than half of its original extent. It\r\nwas once reported to be of great depth. It in early times was famous\r\nfor its excellent fishing. Its original name was undoubtedly an\r\nIndian one. The name Binnewater is a corruption of the German\r\nBeninwasser (Inland water). Boudinot creek is its outlet.\r\n\r\nThe great swamps which once stretched north and east of Smith's\r\nCorners were known to early records as \"Pakadasink Swamp.\" They have\r\nbeen largely cleared, drained, and are coming rapidly under\r\ncultivation. The Shawangunk Kill whose Indian name was the same as\r\nthat of the swamp, \"Pakadasink\" or \"Peakadasink,\" originates from\r\nsprings in the swamps, and flows northward along the base of the\r\nShawangunk mountain toward Ulster County.\r\n\r\nRutger's creek originates in the watershed south of Greenville\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLERS.\r\n\r\nJonathan Wood, justice of the peace as early as 1796, and Timothy\r\nWood (see civil list) resided in Bushville in this town.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Eaton (see civil list) is a descendant of Robert, who came to\r\nthe town, shortly after the Revolution. Robert had sons, John,\r\nWilliam, Robert, and Samuel. There was also an Alexander in the town\r\nof about the same generation as Robert's sons, who had a son Thomas.\r\nJohn, the eldest son of Robert, had two sons, Gabriel and Daniel H.\r\nThe latter during the later years of his life, owned the former David\r\nMoore farm now owned by William Creeden, in Wawayanda, where he died.\r\nGabriel, during the later years of his life retired from active life\r\nto Unionville, where he owned property and where he died. There seems\r\nto have been a James Eaton in the town contemporary with Robert.\r\nTheir farms constituted what was called Eatontown.\r\n\r\nCharles Durland of Long Island settled near Bushville in this town\r\nprior to 1800, and it is probable that Moses came into the town soon\r\nafter he did. Moses lived and died in the town, but Charles bought\r\nland, about a mile and a half south of Ridgeberry, where he made a\r\npermanent settlement and died there. Thomas T., Steward T., Daniel\r\nand Addison were sons of Charles. Steward T. and Daniel became\r\nresidents of Greenville (see civil list). Garret, John and George A.\r\nDurland, descendants of Moses, also resided in Greenville. George A.\r\nand Steward T. were justices of the peace for many terms in the town\r\n(see civil list). Addison settled near Westtown where he died.\r\nThomas T. Durland succeeded to the old homestead near Ridgeberry, and\r\nlater in life bought the former Phineas Howell farm near Slate Hill,\r\nwhere he died. His widow (whose father, George Jackson, in his\r\nlifetime owned the farms now owned by William Ralston, of the lower\r\nroad) and son George, and daughters Alice L. and Etta H., now reside\r\non the Slate Hill homestead; while a son, Charles, resides in\r\nMiddletown and a daughter, Elizabeth Van Orden, lives in Pompton\r\nLakes.\r\n\r\nJohn, Joseph and Hiram Manning were early settlers in the town.\r\nJoseph's children were Joseph, Jr., John, Isaac, Richard, Walter,\r\nBenjamin, Mrs. Isaac Finch, Mrs. E. Hurlbut, Mrs. John Ferguson.\r\nHiram Manning at one time owned the grist, saw and cider mills at\r\nMillsburg. His son, John R. Manning, resides in Gardnersville in\r\nWawayanda, and the latter's son, Hiram, Jr., is in business in\r\nJohnsons.\r\n\r\nAbraham Elston was a very early settler in the town and many of his\r\ndescendants are still in it.\r\n\r\nHarvey H., Alfred, W. L. and W. W. Clark (see civil list) were\r\ndescendants of the David Clark mentioned in a sketch of the family in\r\nthe town of Minisink.\r\n\r\nUnder an old school law teachers were formerly licensed by town\r\nsuperintendents which prevailed up to 1856. Geo. A. Durland held the\r\noffice of superintendent for some time. Samuel S. Graham was elected\r\nto the position in 1856, but the law was repealed that year and he\r\nwas never sworn into office.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\n_The Baptist Church of Greenville_ was incorporated January 27th,\r\n1816, and was supplied by the pastors of Brookfield church until July\r\n31st, 1822, when the church was dedicated as a separate one. It was\r\nconstituted by thirty-one members. Elder Zelotes Grenell preached the\r\nsermon, August 3d. That year twenty-three more members were set off\r\nfrom the Brookfield church to it. Elder Henry Ball was pastor for\r\neleven years. Elder D. Bennet supplied it from Unionville for four\r\nyears. W. H. Jurton, D. Benett, C. Brinkerhoff and Joseph Haughwout\r\nsupplied it to 1848. Rev. Stephen Case became pastor of it in May,\r\n1848, and continued there to his death in 1895. It was said of him\r\nthat he married and buried probably more Orange and Sussex County\r\npeople than any other minister has. He was a son of John and Mary\r\n(Mead) Case. The father is alleged to have come from New England,\r\nwhile his mother was a daughter of Ebenezer Mead of near Waterloo\r\nMills in Minisink. John and Mary (Mead) Case had four sons, Joseph\r\nM., E. Inman, John B. and Stephen.\r\n\r\nJoseph M. was justice of the peace from 1850 to 1874 in Minisink and\r\nheld other offices (see civil list). The Case homestead was on the\r\nridge west of Westtown where John died in 1844 and Rev. Ralph Bull\r\npreached the funeral sermon. His wife died in 1847. Joseph M. was\r\nunmarried. E. Inman died in 1888. He had five sons and one daughter,\r\nJohn, Jr., Joseph, Ira L., Jefferson, Anson and Amelia. Ira L.,\r\nbecame a resident of Middletown and was elected school commissioner\r\nof the second district of Orange County for a term. John B. studied\r\nfor the ministry and became a clergyman of much influence. He died in\r\n1886. He had seven children: John B., Jr., Stephen J., Joseph M.,\r\nTisdale, Joshua I., Sarah and Flora.\r\n\r\nStephen, son of John, after his primary studies were over, attended\r\nand graduated at Madison University in 1840. He began preaching the\r\nnext year, and supplied the pulpit of the Orange Baptist Church six\r\nmonths. Then he preached for three years in what was called the\r\nBroadway Baptist Church, which we incline to think was located near\r\nWykertown in Wantage township, N. J., probably the one built by Job\r\nCosad. In May, 1848, he became pastor of the Mount Salem and\r\nGreenville churches. He was then about thirty years old, and he\r\nlabored there for over sixty years until his death. He was survived\r\nby three sons: John E., Joshua, Jr. and Joseph M. Joshua, Jr., is a\r\nfamous auctioneer residing in Unionville.\r\n\r\n_The Methodist Church of Greenville_ was incorporated December 23rd,\r\n1850. There had been preaching for about twenty years before that by\r\nministers of the M. E. denomination. The church edifice was built\r\nbefore the church was incorporated. Rev. Henry Litts, who died a few\r\nyears ago in Deckertown, was pastor there for some time, succeeding\r\nRevs. Andrews, Grace and Rusling.\r\n\r\nBesides the cemeteries connected with the churches, there are a\r\nnumber of family burial places in the town; notably those of the\r\nManning, Seybolt, Seeley, Courtright, Vanbuskirk, Mulock, Remey and\r\nJenks families.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War the town issued in August, 1864, bonds for\r\n$25,159; they were all paid by February 11th, 1871.\r\n\r\nIts officials have from the formation of the town proved worthy men.\r\nIt has been universally Democratic by a small majority.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Reeves Quick, justice of the peace from 1868 to 1873, was\r\na tall pleasant man, a descendant of the Quick family of\r\nPennsylvania. He was well posted on the history of the famous Tom\r\nQuick, who was a member of the same family. The traditions which Mr.\r\nQuick, of Greenville, had instilled into his mind from accounts\r\nhanded down to him by his grandfather, no doubt truthful, were not\r\naltogether complimentary to the old Indian hunter. His grandfather\r\nsaid (told by Nathaniel R. himself), that Tom, when hard pressed for\r\nsomething to eat, would come to his house and stay till the good\r\nhousewife would absolutely refuse to cook for him any longer, and his\r\ngrandfather would inform Tom that he must either go to work or leave.\r\nThat, he said, always started him, for if there was anything in this\r\nworld that Tom hated it was to work. Then he would shoulder his gun\r\nand tramp off in the forest for two or three months before he\r\nventured to show himself again at the house. In truth, his\r\ngrandfather did not put much dependence on the stories told by Tom\r\nof his adventures, because he thought Tom was merely whiling the time\r\naway with something to wheedle him with, in fact, a sort of \"stand\r\noff\" for lodging.\r\n\r\nThe old Goshen and Minisink turnpike road of the last century,\r\ncrossing Shawangunk Mountain just west of Greenville village, was\r\nchanged by the State to a macadam road constructed or, nearly so, in\r\n1907. It takes a new route across the mountain and has greatly\r\nreduced the grade. The Goshen end of the road to Dolsentown was\r\ncompleted a few years ago, and the one from Dolsentown through\r\nWawayanda and Minisink to the State line about two years ago. The new\r\nroad through Greenville connects with the Wawayanda line at Slate\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nOf the Tory element in the town during the Revolution, it is\r\ntraditionally remembered that Brant is said to have, after his first\r\nraid in 1778, contemplated a more extensive one. For that purpose he\r\ncame to Greenville secretly to get information of the surroundings.\r\nHe hid himself in the Pakadasink swamp below Smith's Corners, and\r\nexplored the vicinity by night. Certain Tories of the neighborhood\r\nwere suspected at the time of furnishing food to some tramp in the\r\nswamp, and one of them was caught returning from the swamp where he\r\nhad been to take a portion of a sheep which he had killed, as it was\r\nlater found out. Excitement ran high at once and a party visited his\r\npremises and found that he had slaughtered a sheep and had taken a\r\npart of it to the swamp to feed a hidden Tory as was supposed. A\r\ncommittee improvised a fife and drum corps, wrapped the bloody\r\nsheepskin about him, and marched him at the point of a bayonet on\r\nfoot to Goshen followed by the music of the fife and drum.\r\n\r\nThis was on a broiling hot day in summer, and, as may well be\r\nsupposed, that march of sixteen miles, bothered as he was by the\r\nflies and the jokes of the people they met, made the victim very\r\nuncomfortable. Later when Brant swooped down on Minisink in 1779, he\r\ndid not cross the mountain into the Greenville neighborhood as the\r\nsettlers then thought he intended to do at first. Then they\r\nascertained the kind of a tramp that the Tory had been furnishing\r\nwith mutton in Pakadasink swamp, and rejoiced to think that their\r\nprompt action in treating their Tory neighbor to that arrest probably\r\nsaved their homes from the invasion planned.\r\n\r\nBefore the days of railroads the people who lived in these\r\nneighborhoods generally went to Newburgh, and if they desired to go\r\nto New York took from thence passage on a sailing vessel for that\r\nplace. Sometimes the passage occupied three or four days between\r\nthose two cities, dependent on the weather. In windy weather the\r\nsloops often had to anchor under some protecting high shore, and in\r\ndark nights they generally anchored until daylight. A disaster which\r\nmade a great sensation throughout the county and elsewhere, happened\r\nNovember 24th, 1824, to a sloop of this kind, near Pollopel's Island,\r\nin lower Newburgh bay. The sloop _Neptune_ was on its way up the\r\nriver under command of its first deck hand, John Decker, the captain\r\n(Halstead) having been left in New York sick. About twenty tons of\r\nplaster were in its hold and about twenty more tons piled on deck,\r\ntogether with eight or ten tons of other goods. There was a strong\r\nwind prevailing and the boat was coming up near the island with a\r\ndouble reef in the mainsail and all precautions taken for safety,\r\nwhen there came a sudden blast of wind which caused the sloop to dip\r\nand the plaster on deck to shift its weight. This shifting of the\r\ndeck plaster caused the sloop to dip so violently that the water came\r\npouring into the scuttle of the forecastle, and into the cabin where\r\nsome ten or twelve women and a number of children were gathered.\r\nBesides the crew about twenty-six male passengers were on the deck.\r\nInstead of righting, the boat went right down without further\r\nwarning. All in the cabin were drowned. It was about noon, and\r\nseveral boats that saw the sloop go down hurried to the scene, and\r\nwere so successful as to rescue seventeen of the passengers.\r\n\r\nJoshua Mulock, of Minisink (now Greenville) was one of the men on\r\ndeck, and he said that when he first heard the women and children\r\nscream in the cabin, he tried to break a grating in the deck to let\r\nthem out and the boat went down so quick that it carried a part of\r\nhis vest with it which caught fast. That held him and he went down\r\nunder the boat. Luckily his vest tore loose, and he floated out from\r\nunder the boat and came to the surface, where he was rescued. Jesse\r\nGreen from present Greenville, and a man named Carey from present\r\nWawayanda neighborhood, were also saved. Among those drowned were\r\nJohn Greenleaf, George Evertson, Matilda Helms and William Kelly and\r\nchild from Minisink. The next year the bodies of Matilda Helms and\r\nMr. Greenleaf were found among others at Cold Spring some distance\r\ndown the river. They were buried by the coroner of Putnam County. The\r\nsloop was afterwards raised by its owners.\r\n\r\nNext to the battle of Minisink this disaster furnished the greatest\r\nsensation of those early times. Mr. Mulock was a great humorist. On\r\none occasion, a Mr. and Mrs. Lee, of Greenville, made Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMulock an evening visit. When the visitors were seated in their wagon\r\nready to start for home, one of them said to their host and hostess,\r\n\"Now you must come and see us as soon as you can.\" \"We'll promise to\r\ndo so, sure!\" said Mr. Mulock.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Lee had arrived home, and she was in the house with\r\na lighted candle looking at the clock and wondering how they came to\r\nstay until after midnight, and he was returning from the stables\r\nwhere he had placed the horse, they were surprised to hear a wagon\r\ndriving up to the door. How much greater was their surprise when they\r\nboth went to the gate to see who it was, and saw there Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMulock. \"You told us,\" said the former, \"that we must come and see\r\nyou as soon as we could, and here we are.\" Then after a laugh at Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Lee's apparent discomfiture, they went home, and told the\r\njoke round about to their friends. We give it to illustrate the\r\njollity of those times.\r\n\r\nFrom the years 1836 to 1854 the post office regulations for the\r\nthree towns, under the name of Minisink, were a mail delivery\r\nTuesdays and Fridays of each week. The mail was carried by a\r\ncontractor, who left Goshen on those days in the morning in a one\r\nhorse sulky or gig which easily carried the driver and mail bags. He\r\ncame across the Wallkill at Pellet's Island to Ridgeberry; thence to\r\nWesttown, Unionville, Minisink (Greenville) and back through\r\nBushville, South Centerville, Brookfield, Slate Hill, Denton and to\r\nGoshen. The trip was made in one day. Sometimes the carrier would\r\nhave a young woman on the seat with him which invariably made him\r\nlate and caused lots of grumbling among the people waiting for the\r\nmail. Few letters were received, and the only newspapers taken\r\ngenerally were the Goshen Democrat and Independent Republican, of\r\nGoshen. Not a daily paper then found its way in this region except\r\nat intervals. The rates of postage were, up to 1845, for a letter of\r\na single sheet, not exceeding thirty miles, six cents; over thirty\r\nand not exceeding eighty miles, ten cents; over eighty and not over\r\n150, twelve and one-half cents; over 150 and not over 400 miles,\r\neighteen and three-quarter cents; over 400 miles, twenty-five cents.\r\nIf the letter had two sheets of paper it was charged double, and if\r\nthree sheets, triple rates; for each newspaper carried not over 100\r\nmiles, one cent; to any office in the State where printed, one cent;\r\notherwise over 100 miles, one and a half cents. Pamphlets 100 miles,\r\none and a half cents a sheet; over 100 miles, two and a half cents a\r\nsheet; if not published periodically, four and six cents a sheet, as\r\nto distance. Everything else was paid at letter postage at a quarter\r\nounce rate. The letters then were sent without envelopes, folded so\r\nas to conceal the writing, and sealed with wax usually. The postage\r\nwas collected on delivery. In 1854 the rates were reduced\r\nconsiderably, but all other features retained. In 1855, the writer,\r\nthen a boy, was left temporarily in charge of the post-office at\r\nSlate Hill, which then paid the postmaster, a storekeeper, about $10\r\na year percentage. He then kept a store and the keeper of the office\r\nwas considered a help to the store trade. A woman came in and asked\r\nif there was a letter for her. There was. She asked how much postage\r\nwas due on it. There was eighteen cents. Then she asked to look at\r\nit. The verdant young man handed it to her. She opened it, glanced\r\nover the contents, then handed it back, saying, \"I won't take it.\r\nThere's nothing in it worth the money.\" The postmaster when informed\r\nof the incident later, said, \"Boy, next time don't you hand out the\r\nletter till they hand over the money.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the postage was reduced and a little later envelopes came in\r\nfashion. The Middletown, Unionville and Watergap Railroad was\r\ncompleted from Middletown to Unionville, June 2nd, 1868. That changed\r\nmail arrangements throughout the three towns. Slate Hill, Johnsons,\r\nWesttown and Unionville got a daily mail. Waterloo Mills, Denton and\r\nBushville were abandoned, and Ridgeberry and South Centerville were\r\nsupplied from Slate Hill. The railroad is now known as the New York,\r\nSusquehanna & Western, under control of the Erie. The increase in\r\nthe amount of mail matter handled has been wonderful, and the offices\r\nwhich once had their mail matter carried on a two-wheel sulky twice a\r\nweek easily, would now require a team of horses and a big wagon to\r\nmove it every day.\r\n\r\nThe 4th and 5th days of January, 1835, were remarkably cold days and\r\nthat winter was a terribly severe one. We have no thermometer records\r\nfor our three towns of those days, but in New York City it was 5\r\ndegrees, in Newark 13 and Elizabethtown 18 degrees below zero for\r\nboth days. In 1857 the 23rd of January was a remarkably cold day, the\r\nthermometer standing at 23 below in the early morning, 17 at noon,\r\nand 12 at night, when it began to snow and a deep snow came.\r\n\r\nOrange County gave 3,541 votes for Van Buren and 2,242 for Harrison\r\nfor President in 1836.\r\n\r\nThe local option law in our three towns has resulted in a continual\r\nno-license majority for about twenty-five years in Wawayanda;\r\noccasional no-license in Greenville and Minisink. The result of the\r\nelection in 1907 gave no-license a majority in Minisink.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times elections were held in the spring for local\r\nofficers, and in the fall for county, State and national officers.\r\nAll the officers in the State are now elected in November on one day.\r\nIn 1837, the States held election: Maine, 2nd Monday of September;\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, 1st\r\nMonday in August; Delaware, 1st Tuesday of October; Louisiana, 1st\r\nMonday of July; Tennessee and North Carolina, 1st Thursday in August;\r\nVermont, 1st Tuesday in September; Georgia and Maryland, 1st Monday\r\nin October; New York, 1st Monday in November; Massachusetts, 2nd\r\nMonday in November; New Hampshire, 2nd Tuesday in March; Virginia and\r\nConnecticut in April; Rhode Island in August; South Carolina, 2nd\r\nMonday in October.\r\n\r\nDuring the first early years of our history, where farmers kept large\r\ndairies, they made butter, which was the mainstay of their farming.\r\nThey used a tread-wheel about twelve feet in diameter set at a steep\r\nincline, on one side of which a horse or bull climbed to furnish the\r\npower for churning. Similar dairies used sheep or calves. About 1834\r\nto 1840 (tradition) George F. Reeve, of near Middletown, invented an\r\nendless chain-power on which a good-sized dog would furnish as much\r\npower as an animal twice as large.\r\n\r\nLights for many years were furnished of dip tallow candles. These\r\nwere made by melting a wash boiler full of tallow, into which six\r\ncandle-wicks hung on a stick were dipped and hung on a rack to cool.\r\nEnough sticks were used so that by the time the last one was dipped\r\nthe first one was cool enough to dip again, and so the process was\r\ncontinued until the candles had accumulated enough tallow to be of\r\nthe right size. Whenever the tallow in the boiler began to get low\r\nhot water was added to make the tallow float to the top of the\r\nboiler. When beeves were killed in the fall the good housewives were\r\ncareful to dip candles for a whole year's supply. About 1852\r\ncamphene began to be used for lights, and in some instances alcohol\r\nand some other dangerous compounds. About 1860 the use of kerosene\r\ncame into family and public lighting, and is still the great\r\nilluminant.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 a real estate ownership of one hundred pounds value was a\r\nnecessary qualification for a voter who desired to vote for a\r\nGovernor, Senator and Assemblyman, while only twenty pounds worth of\r\nreal estate was requisite in order to qualify a person to vote for a\r\nrepresentative in Congress. For town officials and resolutions all\r\nmale citizens were allowed to vote, and this was generally done at\r\ntown meetings viva voce, or by division to the right and left. A\r\nGovernor then held office three years and had to be a real estate\r\nowner. Senators held office four years and had to be owners of one\r\nhundred pounds worth of real estate. Judges were appointed by the\r\nGovernor and council and held office during good behavior, but were\r\ndisqualified when sixty years old. They could be removed by the\r\nGovernor when requested by a two-thirds vote of the legislature.\r\nClergymen were then excluded from holding office, and from the\r\nlegislature. In 1821 a new State constitution was framed and the\r\nproperty qualifications removed. Ballots were then introduced\r\ngenerally in town elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF HAMPTONBURGH.\r\n\r\nBy Margaret Crawford Jackson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 1703, in the reign of Queen Anne, the Wawayanda patent\r\nwas signed. The grantors were twelve Indians named Rapingonick,\r\nWawastawa, Moghopuck, Comelawaw, Manawitt, Ariwimack, Rumbout,\r\nClauss, Chonckhass, Chingapaw, Oshaquemonus and Quiliapaw, and among\r\nthe twelve patentees was Christofer Denn. He was a Frenchman and a\r\ncarpenter, then living on the eastern shore of Staten Island with his\r\nwife, Elizabeth, and a young girl sixteen years of age, Sarah Wells,\r\nwho had been taken by them as an infant and brought up as their own,\r\nalthough she did not receive their name, nor at their deaths did they\r\nmention her in their wills, probably because she had received one\r\nhundred acres after her marriage.\r\n\r\nChristofer Denn, as his name is spelled by Mr. Eager in his history,\r\nor \"Denne,\" as spelled by Mr. Ruttenber, the latter says, was a\r\nresident of New York in 1701, and one of the signers of the\r\n\"Protestant Petition\" to William III, in that year. In 1702 his name\r\nappears appended to the congratulatory address to Lord Cornbury as\r\none \"of the chiefest inhabitants of the City and County on New York.\"\r\nAnd in 1705 he was one of the signers of a petition by the merchants\r\nof that city. He was still a resident of New York in 1722-1723, and\r\nit was in that city his wife Elizabeth died. It should be noticed\r\nthat it is said Denn was a resident of the county of New York, even\r\nwhen not living in the city.\r\n\r\nSARAH WELLS.\r\n\r\nAround Sarah Wells much of the history of Hamptonburgh is woven. She\r\nwas born in New Jersey, opposite Staten Island, April 6, 1694, and\r\ndied April 21, 1796, aged 102 years, leaving 355 living descendants.\r\nHer husband was William Bull, an Englishman from Wolverhampton. The\r\nfamily left there for Dublin in February, 1689. At Wolverhampton the\r\nchurch register shows the records of the family back to 900 A. D. The\r\nlate claim is that William Bull, son of John Bull, and grandson of\r\nJosias Bull, of Kingshurst Hall, who emigrated in 1715, settling at\r\nHamptonburgh, Orange County, New York, is identical with the husband\r\nof Sarah Wells. But whether Kingshurst Hall is in Wolverhampton we\r\ncannot say at this moment. However, the coat-of-arms belonging to the\r\nBulls of Kingshurst Hall has been engraved and virtually accepted by\r\nMr. Ebenezer Bull, of Hamptonburgh, as that of his ancestors.\r\n\r\nChristofer Denn's share of 2,000 acres in the Wawayanda patent having\r\nbeen set apart, he visited the location and made friends with the\r\nIndians living there. The claim was surveyed by Peter Berian and lay\r\ntouching the northeasterly bounds of the town lots of the village of\r\nGoshen. Its bounds run thus: \"Beginning at a stake and stones about\r\neast of and ten chains from the dwelling-house of General Abraham\r\nVail in East Division; thence northwesterly along the northeasterly\r\nbounds of the Goshen town lots, and until it meets with a line\r\nsupposed to divide the old counties of Ulster and Orange; thence east\r\nalong the same to a stake and stones known to be standing near the\r\ntop of the highland, or mountain above Charles Heard's in\r\nHamptonburgh; thence on a course about thirty-six degrees west to the\r\nplace of beginning.\"\r\n\r\nSome difficulty arose later in running the survey of other lines\r\nwhich interfered with Denn's claim.\r\n\r\nTo settle it a grant was made after his death in the name of his\r\nwife, Elizabeth \"Denne,\" of 1,140 acres, December 12, 1734. Although\r\nthe patent had been signed there was a condition that unless a\r\nsettlement was made on the Wawayanda patent by the end of May, 1712,\r\nthe title was to lapse. Add to this that six hundred acres were to be\r\ngiven to the first settler and we may find a sufficient motive for\r\nChristofer Denn to become the needed pioneer.\r\n\r\nHis affairs were embarrassed at the time, and this change from the\r\ncity to the wilderness probably offered a much needed retreat for a\r\ntime at least. He took with him on his return to the city after his\r\ninspection of the land, three young Indians, sons of those whom he\r\nhad visited and of the tribe which had parted with their land to the\r\npatentees. They had befriended the surveyors while running out the\r\npatent and had kindly volunteered their services to help him remove\r\nfrom the city to the patent. All accounts say that three young\r\nIndians went with him to the city and helped to direct the party.\r\n\r\nIt was Sarah Wells, this slender, dark-eyed little girl of sixteen,\r\nwhom Denn chose to go forth alone with the men to conquer the\r\nwilderness. When he told her, she was sick with terror at the\r\nthought that in the latter part of her journey her only companions\r\nwould be the carpenters and half-naked savages, who might attack her\r\nat any moment.\r\n\r\nThe carpenters sent to build the log house, of whom there were two,\r\nknew nothing of the country, and had treachery been intended the\r\nwhites must have been defenseless.\r\n\r\nDenn, being in straitened circumstances at the time, the other\r\npatentees came to his assistance and supplied the sloop and crew and\r\ncows and horses to assist in the settlement which, according to\r\nEager, was to hold the Wawayanda Patent.\r\n\r\nThe present family believe him to have been correct in regard to\r\ntheir history, for he was a descendant on his mother's side. He gives\r\na full and romantic account of this journey, from which we can only\r\ngive extracts.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"As this portion of our narrative was derived from Sarah in\r\nafter life, we purpose to place an inventory of the various articles\r\nof outfit before the reader, that he may judge of its nature, extent\r\nand value, which are as follows: Two pack horses with bells on, two\r\nmilk cows with bells, two dogs, two Irish Brahmas, one spade, two\r\npails, two beds and bedding, one small and one large kettle, wood\r\ntrenchers and bowls, candlesticks and candles, a pair of trammels, a\r\nfrying pan, small tin plates for saucers, coffee pot with coffee,\r\nteapot, chocolate, tin canister with tea, silver teaspoons and sugar\r\ntongs, small china teacups and saucers, bundle of cloths, saddlebags,\r\npillow saddles, knives and forks, some potatoes, wallets, medical\r\ncordials in vials, refined sugar in small pieces, brown sugar in\r\nrolls, flour, biscuit, ham in small sacks, some trinkets, ribbons and\r\nsmall knives for the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nThere may have been other articles not enumerated. As Denn bade Sarah\r\ngood-bye in a subdued voice and tones of affectionate regard, he\r\nsaid: \"Sarah, you have been kind and dutiful to us thus far, and your\r\npresent conduct confirms us in your kindness. The duty you have to\r\nperform is new and may be fatiguing, but must if possible be\r\naccomplished now or the season may be lost. The workmen will take\r\ncare of you while on the boat and afterwards, while the Indians, of\r\nwhose friendship I have no doubt, will guide you through the woods\r\nto the place selected for our dwelling. This work is very important\r\nand what you do for Madam Denn and me is also done for the benefit of\r\nthe company.\" He ended thus: \"God save and bless you, Sarah.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Bull.]\r\n\r\nThe Indians faithfully performed their part and the one who was given\r\nespecial charge over Sarah's horse (after the party landed on the\r\nbanks of the Hudson near Cornwall), although half-naked, as were the\r\nother two, watched carefully her comfort. Their eyes were piercing,\r\ntheir voices harsh and grating, yet Sarah's attendant showed a\r\ndeference; and gentle anxiety to please that many white men of to-day\r\nmight envy.\r\n\r\nSarah mounted on the second horse, sat upon beds and bedding with\r\nmany small articles around her and managed her horse with great\r\ndifficulty. The Indian marched close by her side, helped her on and\r\noff her horse, and pointed out many things in the woods calculated\r\nto interest her attention and draw her out in conversation. Not\r\ninfrequently he plucked an early flower as it sprang up by the\r\nwayside, and calling her attention to it, tasted its leaves and then\r\npresented it for acceptance.\r\n\r\nThey arrived on the bank of the stream, now the Otterkill, opposite\r\nthe spot which Christofer Denn had selected as the place of his\r\nresidence. Thus the journey in full twenty miles of pathless forest,\r\nwith occasional thick underwood, was performed in a single day.\r\n\r\nThey built a fire beneath a tree whose branches guarded them from\r\ndampness. They put boughs of trees upon forked sticks driven into the\r\nground and laid the beds there to escape the snakes, and the\r\ncarpenters lay down and slept well till morning, but Sarah dreamed\r\nand slept fitfully, while the Indians threw themselves on the ground\r\nwith their feet to the fire and slept all night. Whenever Sarah\r\nroused herself to look about, \"her Indian\" made signs to her that all\r\nwas well and he was guarding her. The next day the carpenters built a\r\nwigwam of split logs resting on end against a frame of poles 16 by 18\r\nfeet with a ditch about it to carry off rain. It had a slanting roof\r\nwith a hole three feet square in the peak for the escape of smoke,\r\nthe fireplace being below it.\r\n\r\nThe goods were first unpacked and plates set on the table for supper\r\nthe second evening of their arrival, when one of the Indians saw two\r\npeople at a distance, and going to reconnoiter, found Madam Denn and\r\nher husband. They had been so overcome by the parting from Sarah and\r\nthe enormity of their conduct in sending her on such a perilous\r\nadventure, that they had followed her on horseback up through New\r\nJersey as fast as they could, and arrived in time for the first meal\r\nin the new wigwam. On seeing them at the door she fainted at their\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nIt is only just to say that the friendship thus begun between Sarah\r\nand the Indians continued to the end.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians were most hostile to others in the neighborhood the\r\nfamily could always give a safe refuge to the many who sought a\r\nshelter under their roof when night came.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BULL.\r\n\r\nIn 1716 William Bull entered on the scene. Born in Wolverhampton,\r\nEngland, February, 1689, his youth was, however, passed in Dublin,\r\nwhere his father moved when he was small.\r\n\r\nHe was apprenticed to learn the trade of a mason and stone cutter.\r\nWhen his apprenticeship ended he and a young friend took the\r\ncontract to build a large arch for a bridge being constructed near\r\nDublin. Tradition says: One Saturday night the work was nearly done\r\nand the arch finished but for the keystone. He begged the men to\r\nremain and put it in place, so completing the work, but they refused.\r\nOn going down to see it on the next morning he found it fallen and\r\nhis fortunes with it. It had carried with it his all and\r\nimprisonment for debt--as far as he knew it might be for life--stared\r\nhim in the face.\r\n\r\nThere was a ship lying at the dock which he knew was sailing that day\r\nfor New York. He searched his pockets and discovered five guineas\r\nwith which and a few books he boarded the vessel. The captain on\r\nbeing asked if that much money would take him to America, answered it\r\nwould. On reaching New York the captain told him the money had\r\nbrought him, but had not paid his full passage and he must be sold\r\nfor the balance. Bull was highly indignant and refused to leave the\r\nship. He replied that he would return to Ireland and face his debts.\r\nDaniel Cromline, who also had a share in the Wawayanda patent, heard\r\nthat an Irish ship was in dock, and hoping to procure some workmen\r\nhad it proclaimed on board the ship. Bull felt that Providence and\r\nstrangers would help him, and on telling his story to Mr. Cromline\r\nthe money was advanced and they traveled together as far as\r\nGreycourt. Here he did the mason work on the old stone Greycourt\r\nhouse in 1716.\r\n\r\nThis was long a public inn on the way from the Hudson to New Jersey,\r\nand was a famous resort for the people around.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bull lived in the Cromline family, whose patent was not far\r\nfrom that part of the Wawayanda patent on which Mr. Denn had settled.\r\nThey were in fact neighboring families, and so William Bull met\r\nSarah Wells. They loved each other and were married in 1718.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony took place in the new double log house of Christofer\r\nDenn, and as Bull was an Episcopalian and desired to be married by\r\nthe rites of his church they did not know how to proceed. There was\r\nno church nor a clergyman who could proclaim the banns three weeks,\r\nbut courts of justice had been established and a magistrate was in\r\nthe neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThey decided that circumstances alter cases and summoned their\r\nguests. All being assembled the magistrate carrying the prayer book\r\nproceeded first to the front door and proclaimed the banns to the\r\ntrees of the forest, then through the hall to the back door where he\r\nproclaimed it to the cattle and the outbuildings. He made\r\nproclamation then once more from the front door to the wilderness at\r\nlarge and then performed the marriage ceremony. The wedding dress was\r\nof homespun linen delicately embroidered by the bride, and is now in\r\nthe possession of one of her descendants, who has exhibited it at the\r\nfamily picnic held each year on the last Wednesday in August in the\r\ngrove at Campbell Hall.\r\n\r\nLater Sarah Wells Bull asked for and received the promised reward of\r\n100 acres from Christofer Denn for having gone alone at his bidding\r\nto settle his claim and save his title.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bull and Richard Gerard received a grant joining Denn's of\r\n2,600 acres, August 10, 1723.\r\n\r\nOn the 100 acres given to Sarah, Bull built a barn of hand-sawed\r\nplanks. These were of ash, rived, and the shingles of split pine and\r\nput on each with two pegs. This barn is still in use and never has\r\nbeen painted. Afterwards he built the stone house in 1727 on his own\r\nland near by, and it is still occupied by the family and probably\r\nwill stand for generations to come. It is built on a rock, with a\r\nspring in the cellar, and before the house was quite finished in\r\nSeptember, 1727, an earthquake which was felt for 1,500 miles,\r\ncracked the east side of the house and the crack can still be seen.\r\nThe lightning struck it in 1767-8, but only slight damage was done to\r\nits thick stone walls. The house has two stories of eleven feet each,\r\nwith basement and a good-sized garret. It is a truly fine house for\r\nthose times. Mr. Bull called his place Hamptonburgh, from\r\nWolverhampton where he was born. There were eight children born to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFEATURES AND SETTLERS.\r\n\r\n Stephen Jayne.\r\n Daniel Jayne.\r\n Joseph Hildreth.\r\n Adam Miller.\r\n Isaac Tobias.\r\n David Bloomfield.\r\n Gilbert Roberts.\r\n Lawrence Ferguson.\r\n Daniel Harrison.\r\n Daniel Miller.\r\n Joseph Gold.\r\n Henry Davenport.\r\n Israel Osmun.\r\n Ezekiel Osmun.\r\n Henry Hall.\r\n William Cooper.\r\n Samuel Lows.\r\n Jacob Lows.\r\n\r\nHamptonburgh township as it now stands was set apart in 1830 from the\r\ntowns bounding it. It is in the form of an irregular hexagon, its\r\nnorthern extremity a point and Montgomery bounding it on the\r\nnortheast and northwest, with the Wallkill river running between\r\nWallkill township on the west and Montgomery on the northwest, while\r\nGoshen is on the southwest, Blooming Grove the southeast and New\r\nWindsor on the east.\r\n\r\nThe Otterkill circles through the town adding picturesqueness to the\r\nfields it waters, while high ridges and fertile valleys vary the\r\nscene. The Goshen and Montgomery State road runs northeast through\r\nthe western part of the town and the Little Britain State road joins\r\nit at Clark's Crossing. Mr. Clark's farm, once the Denniston Bull\r\nfarm, is now in the hands of the New York and New Jersey Railroad,\r\nand the road is being constructed. It is claimed that this will put\r\nCampbell Hall within one hour of New York City, instead of the three\r\ndays' journey by sloop and horseback which Sarah Wells had to\r\nundergo.\r\n\r\nAt Campbell Hall Junction four railroads center, the Ontario and\r\nWestern, the Central New England, the Wallkill Valley Division of the\r\nN. Y. C. & H. R. and the Erie, while the Lehigh and New England runs\r\nthrough the eastern part of the town from north to south, with\r\nstations at Hamptonburgh, Girard and Burnside, thus making this\r\nsmall town of more than proportionate interest in the county.\r\n\r\nThere are six rural schools and one church now in the town. This is\r\nthe Presbyterian church at Campbell Hall, where also are the stores\r\nof Alexander Brothers and C. B. Howell, a meat market, a creamery and\r\na blacksmith's shop, and the surrounding houses with neat lawns make\r\nan attractive hamlet.\r\n\r\nThe two-room schoolhouse stands in a grove of oaks on a hill\r\noverlooking the Otterkill where the old church stood before it was\r\nmoved to Hamptonburgh proper. Now that building stands empty and only\r\nthe graveyard tells the old story. The name Campbell Hall came from a\r\nColonel Campbell who lived there. His house was back of what is now\r\nthe Bertholf house. \"Col. Campbell was a Scotchman, the father of\r\nMrs. Margaret Eustace, who was the mother of Gen. Eustace of the\r\nRevolutionary army of France, both of whom, we believe, died in the\r\nvicinity of Newburgh thirty or thirty-five years since.\" (Eager in\r\n1846-7.) In speaking of Mrs. Eustace he notes her dignity of manner\r\nwhen she resided at Campbell Hall; also of her husband, Doctor\r\nEustace, who was from the South, he says there was a secret not fully\r\nunderstood which embittered the last years of her life and her\r\nfather's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bull House, Hamptonburgh, Erected 1722.]\r\n\r\nCampbell Hall owes much to Mrs. Matilda Booth Gouge. Her husband,\r\nMr. George Gouge, conducted a large creamery business there for\r\nyears, and on his death he left his widow more than comfortably\r\nprovided for. There were no children and Mrs. Gouge did many kind\r\nthings for her neighbors before her death. She gave the ground on\r\nwhich the church was built and a large house for a parsonage close to\r\nthe church. She also educated a colored man for the ministry. On her\r\ndeath she willed her large residence with its furniture for a more\r\ncomfortable home for the pastor and her farm of 100 acres to the\r\nchurch with $5,000 in bonds. Most of the buildings in the village are\r\nbuilt on land purchased from her. Her birthplace was near and is now\r\nowned by Mr. C. B. Howell.\r\n\r\nBurnside has a sawmill, a store and a Borden's creamery. Post offices\r\nare in each place and the R. F. D. comes out from Montgomery. This\r\ncloses the helpful public activities of the town, but fine hotels,\r\nwith bars, make an addition not to be omitted. It is impossible to\r\nfollow closely all the different family fortunes of those who make\r\nthe records of to-day; our allotted space is too small.\r\n\r\nThere are two of the original grants on which the descendants of the\r\npatentees are still living. These are the Richard Gerard and William\r\nBull grants.\r\n\r\nThe one of 2,600 acres was dated August 10, 1723, on which, by a\r\nmistake of calculation, the carpenters erected the first wigwam in\r\n1712, followed by the William Bull stone house.\r\n\r\nThe second grant lay partly in Wallkill, partly in Hamptonburgh,\r\ndivided unevenly by the Wallkill River, William Bull, Esq., the\r\ngreat-great-grandson of the first one of the name here, lives upon\r\nthe western portion, and the stone house known as Hill-Hold on the\r\neastern part, belongs to the descendants of the third son of William\r\nBull--Thomas Bull, Robert McLeod Jackson and Margaret Eleanor Jackson\r\nand their mother, Margaret Crawford Jackson, wife of Robert McDowell\r\nJackson, son of William Wickham Jackson.\r\n\r\nThe stones in the house were cut in the fields by the builder, Thomas\r\nBull, as he had time for the work between planting and reaping. It\r\nwas years before he was ready to build. Paneling was brought from\r\nEngland for the east and west sides of the two large first-floor\r\nrooms. Also solid mahogany balls for the newels and mahogany\r\nbalusters. The walls are two feet thick, with open fireplaces\r\nthroughout the house and massive chimney stacks on the east and west.\r\nThis house also stands on a rock, is in good repair and has a\r\nbeautiful situation on a hill.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago Mr. Charles Backman bought the road house by Stony\r\nFord bridge, known as the Sutton House, with race track, and began to\r\nimprove Orange County's fine trotting stock. Little by little he\r\nbought the adjoining farm land until he owned 640 acres and remade\r\nthe mile of road from Stony Ford to La Grange into as fine a highway\r\nas are the best State roads to-day.\r\n\r\nHis house was visited by many noted people, among them General Grant\r\nwhen President, and General Benjamin F. Tracy, now ex-Secretary of\r\nthe Navy. Mr. J. Howard Force now owns the place. General Tracy owned\r\nfor a few years a farm in Goosetown or LaGrange, which he named\r\nMarshland and greatly improved. This also was a stock farm for fine\r\nhorses; it is now in other hands. Mr. Backman bought part of the\r\nValentine Hill farm originally belonging to Andrew Wilson, who was a\r\nprivate in Colonel James McClaughrey's regiment of Little Britain. In\r\nOctober, 1777, he was one of the hundred men sent out from Fort\r\nMontgomery to intercept the British, who were 5,000 strong and\r\ncommanded by Sir Henry Clinton in person.\r\n\r\nHere is a dispatch from Governor Clinton, dated October 7, 1777, the\r\nday after the fort was taken: \"We received intelligence that the\r\nenemy were advancing on the west side of the mountain with design to\r\nattack us in the rear. Upon this ordered out Colonels Bruyer and\r\nMcClaughrey with upwards of 100 men towards Doodletown with a brass\r\nfield piece, with a detachment of sixty men on every advantageous\r\npost on the road to the furnace. They were not long out before they\r\nwere attacked by the enemy with their whole force; our people behaved\r\nwith spirit and must have made great slaughter of the enemy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George W. Carpenter.]\r\n\r\nAndrew Wilson was here taken prisoner and when an English soldier\r\nordered him to take off his silver shoe buckles he refused and was\r\nknocked down by the butt of a musket and his buckles taken. He lay\r\non the sugar hulk for two years and believed he was treated with\r\ngreater indignity than others because of his refusal.\r\n\r\nAfter his release he lived on the farm mentioned on the east bank of\r\nthe Wallkill. His son James died first, he himself in 1804. He left\r\ntwo sons and a daughter. John lived and died in Goshen. His son,\r\nAndrew, raised two companies in 1812, the first he turned over to his\r\nintimate friend, Burnett of Little Britain, that they might not be\r\nseparated; the second gave him a commission as lieutenant in the\r\nregular army. Afterwards he became captain and was in charge at\r\nGovernor's Island. He married a daughter of William Bull, of\r\nWallkill, Milinda Ann, and made a home in Goshen. He was sent to the\r\nLegislature from there in 1819. He was prominent in the temperance\r\nmovement, also the Bible society and the church life of Hamptonburgh.\r\n\r\nThe first pastor settled at Hamptonburgh was the Rev. James R.\r\nJohnson, formerly of Goshen. The tide of prosperity in the town was\r\nexpected to set to the east, about the new church, but the hopes were\r\nnot fulfilled, and little by little Campbell Hall became the\r\nestablished center. The Rev. Slater C. Hepburn was called after Mr.\r\nJohnson and was installed July 2, 1850, and died in Campbell Hall\r\nafter serving his people forty-five years.\r\n\r\nAble B. Watkins was an early settler near the Denns and had a family\r\nof ten children.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 Silas Pierson came from Long Island and took possession of\r\nwhat long was known as the old shingle house on the Pierson farm,\r\na mile northeast of Hamptonburgh church. This house was burned this\r\nspring of 1907, April 13th. The eastern half was built of squared\r\nlogs up to the eaves.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of July, 1760, James De Laney, Esq., his Majesty's\r\nlieutenant-governor and commander-in-chief in and over the province\r\nof New York and the territories depending thereon, signed a\r\ncommission appointing Silas Pierson to be captain of the company of\r\nmilitia foot lately commanded by John Bull, Esq. This was near the\r\nclose of the French and Indian War, when England had determined to\r\ndestroy the power of France in America. The militia was liable to be\r\ncalled out at any time to defend the settlements against the attacks\r\nof the Indians and to avenge their wrongs.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 Silas Pierson was captain in Jesse Woodhull's regiment; later\r\nhe was captain of a light horse company in the Revolution. Silas\r\nPierson and Silas Pierson, Jr., were among the many signers of the\r\npledge in the Cornwall precincts, in which they declared that they\r\nwould never become slaves and would aid the Continental Congress in\r\nopposing the arbitrary acts of the British Parliament. Joshua\r\nPierson, grandfather of George Pierson, Sr., was a private in Col.\r\nJesse Woodhull's regiment in 1777 at the age of sixteen, and went\r\nwith the regiment under the command of Major Zachariah Du Bois to\r\nassist in the defense of Fort Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe family of Mr. William Henry Pierson still resides on the old\r\nfarm. His wife was Miss Elizabeth Bull of the \"stone house.\" His\r\ndaughter Lucile married Harry Bull, of Wallkill, who, like his\r\nfather, is justice of the peace. It thus appears that in a large\r\ndegree the history of Hamptonburgh township is the history of the\r\nBulls, for marriage has linked the family with so many other\r\nwell-known names.\r\n\r\nWe would like to give a list of the men who have served as\r\nsupervisors and also as elders of the church. Indeed our story could\r\nwell lengthen itself into a small volume were all to be told which\r\nis of interest in our little town. We have tried to keep a class of\r\nfacts which hold more than a passing and local interest.\r\n\r\nWe have drawn for our material upon such published records as have\r\nbeen within our reach, and have consulted with persons who have\r\nknowledge of such points as may have been in dispute.\r\n\r\nLet us hope we have wronged no one in anything said or left unsaid,\r\nand have disseminated no more false facts than are unavoidable with\r\nthe most conscientious historians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF HIGHLANDS.\r\n\r\nBy Captain Theodore Faurot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the younger towns of Orange County, only those of\r\nTuxedo and Woodbury having been born later. It is, in fact, only\r\nabout thirty-five years old. But for scenic beauty and native charm\r\nit easily outranks every other town in this county, if not all\r\nothers on the Hudson River. The fame of the Hudson River Highlands\r\nis worldwide, and it is in this little town that the culmination of\r\nthis native grandeur and picturesque beauty is reached. No one who\r\nhas ever sailed up or down the Hudson, and who has not, will spend a\r\nmoment wondering why this township was thus named.\r\n\r\nThe general shape or contour of the town, laterally, may be roughly\r\nclassed as triangular. But the topographical surface is far more\r\ndifficult to classify. It has the most extended river frontage of any\r\ntown in the country, it being some nine or ten miles, beginning at\r\nCro' Nest, in the town of Cornwall on the north, and reaching below\r\nFort Montgomery, to the Rockland County line.\r\n\r\nIt is bounded on the north by the town of Cornwall, on the east by\r\nthe Hudson River, on the south by Rockland county and the town of\r\nWoodbury, and on the west by Woodbury.\r\n\r\nThe area of this young town, as now estimated by the Orange\r\nsupervisors, is 15,514 acres. In 1879 it was placed at 9,324-1/2\r\nacres. This fractional total would seem to indicate that a very\r\ncareful survey had been made previous to that time. But nobody has\r\nbeen quite able to explain just how this unique engineering feat was\r\naccomplished. Looking at the town from the river, the task presents\r\nmany features of serious import, even to the mountain engineer.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing was valued at $330,600 by the assessors of 1879. But\r\nof course there was nothing allowed for sentiment or native grandeur\r\nin that cold, business estimate. Perhaps such things really had no\r\ncash value at that time, if indeed they have now. The tax of the town\r\nthat year amounted to $2,896.67. In 1906 the total value of this real\r\nestate was placed at $857,112. Upon this amount a tax of $8,610.67\r\nwas levied. This was made up as follows: $3,474.20, general fund;\r\n$4,423.37, town audits; $250.02, sworn off taxes; and $0.33,\r\ntreasurer's credits.\r\n\r\nTITLE TO THE LANDS.\r\n\r\nConcerning these, previous to the Revolution, little is definitely\r\nknown. The lands around the Point, from which West Point takes its\r\nname, and to the north and west thereof, were originally granted by\r\nthe British Crown to Captain John Evans. In 1723 these lands, having\r\nbeen re-assumed by the Crown, the larger portion was granted to\r\nCharles Congreve upon condition that he, or his heirs and assigns,\r\nshould settle there and cultivate at least three acres out of every\r\nfifty acres of land conveyed to him in the grant. The inference is,\r\ntherefore, that the first buildings at West Point were erected about\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nThis Congreve tract comprised some 1,463 acres, which included the\r\nnorthern portion of the Point. But the records do not give the names\r\nof these early white settlers. In March, 1747, another portion of\r\nthis John Evans tract, covering 332 acres, was granted to John Moore,\r\non the same conditions contained in the first grant to Congreve. This\r\ntract adjoined the southwest corner of the Congreve Patent. John\r\nMoore afterward purchased the Congreve tract and thus became the\r\nowner of 1,790 acres in the vicinity of the Point. This he\r\nsubsequently devised to his son, Stephen Moore, a merchant of\r\nCaswell, N. C. Then after a forty-year tenure of this land by the\r\nMoore family it was finally sold to the United States Government,\r\npursuant to an act of Congress passed July 5, 1790. The deed of\r\ntransfer was executed by Moore, December 10, of the same year. The\r\nprice paid was $11,085. The necessity of this purchase was urged upon\r\nCongress by Alexander Hamilton, as Secretary of the Treasury, and\r\nalso by Henry Knox, who was then Secretary of War, who finally\r\nconducted the negotiations for the purchase for the Government.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Evans obtained his original grant on petition, March,\r\n1694, from Governor Dongan, who had purchased the land from the\r\nEsopus Indians. It was described as extending \"from Murderer's Creek\r\nback,\" This stream finds the Hudson at Cornwall. Captain Gee, of the\r\nancient sloop Federal, who brought stores to West Point between 1790\r\nand 1810, seems to have owned a dwelling house near the Point about\r\nthat time, when it was known as Gee's Point.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the Congreve Patent on the south was one of the six tracts\r\noriginally granted to Gabriel and William Ludlow, October 18, 1731,\r\nunder the conditions of settlement already named. This tract seems to\r\nhave passed to many successive owners, as follows:\r\n\r\nRichard Williams, of Cornwall; Robert Armstrong, of Sussex County,\r\nN. J.; Benjamin Rose, December 1, 1785; John Dunlap, of Ulster\r\nCounty, September 6, 1788; and Thomas North, of Cornwall, November\r\n22, 1704. North also purchased an adjoining tract on the south from\r\nIsaiah Smith, June 3, 1790, and he held the whole tract for nearly\r\nthirty years. Then it passed to Oliver Gridley, of Bergen County,\r\nN. J., December 28, 1819. who deeded the same to the United States,\r\nMay 13, 1824, in accordance with the act of Congress, approved March\r\n10, of that year.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the purchase of the Congreve and Moore grants by the\r\nGovernment, Hugh McClellan, a Revolutionary soldier, occupied a small\r\nhouse on the property. In recognition of his patriotic services in\r\nthat war he was permitted to remain and cultivate his garden by\r\nSecretary of War John Knox. The old soldier spent the rest of his\r\nlife there, leaving a wife and a daughter on the premises. They\r\nfinally claimed the domicile by right of undisputed possession under\r\nthe laws of the State. But they were finally dispossessed by the\r\nNational Government in 1830, in an action for ejectment. {_sic_}\r\n\r\nIn addition to the patents already named the following list of\r\ngrants, covering other parts of this town of Highlands, are found on\r\nthe record: Gabriel and William Ludlow, 991 acres, October 13, 1731;\r\nAlexander Phoenix, 1,000 acres, July 13, 1750; Thomas Moore and Lewis\r\nPintard, 1,100 acres, December 27, 1762; Samuel Staats, 400 acres,\r\nJune 5, 1712; Thomas Ellison, 770 acres, November 12, 1750; Richard\r\nBradley, 800 acres, July 30, 1743; Gabriel and William Ludlow, 407\r\nacres, October 18, 1731; Vincent and David Matthews, 1,000 acres,\r\nNovember 26, 1761; Gabriel and William Ludlow, 1,437 acres, October\r\n18, 1731; Bradley children, 4,290 acres, October 30, 1749; Vincent\r\nand David Matthews, 800 acres, November 26, 1768; William and Edward\r\nWilkin, 1,305 acres, April 15, 1768; John Osborne, 1,850 acres, March\r\n14, 1775; Thomas Moore and Lewis Pintard 2,900 acres, December 23,\r\n1762; Smith and Wilkin 100 acres, April 15, 1768; Moore and Osborne,\r\n150 acres, March 14, 1775; Smith and Wilkin, 190 acres, April 15,\r\n1768; John Nelson, 550 acres, October 4, 1752; Henry Townsend, 2,000\r\nacres; Thomas Smith, 250 acres, June 14, 1750; the Hassenclever &\r\nCo.'s tract, 1,000 acres, 1705.\r\n\r\nCaptain Horace M. Reeve, of the general staff of the United States\r\nArmy, in his history of West Point during the Revolution, says:\r\n\"Until the American troops began to cut timber for military purposes,\r\nand to crown the surrounding hills with forts and redoubts, West\r\nPoint and the neighboring Highlands were little else than a\r\nwilderness of rugged hills and virgin forests, presenting about the\r\nsame appearance as first greeted Hendrik Hudson when, in 1609, he\r\nsailed up the river which now bears his name.\"\r\n\r\nHudson anchored near West Point September 14, 1609, and he was\r\nprobably the first European that ever saw that section.\r\n\r\nContinuing, Captain Reeve says: \"Although this tract of country could\r\nnever lend itself kindly to the agriculturist, yet before the advent\r\nof the American soldier there were several houses standing at or near\r\nWest Point, which were subsequently used for purposes very foreign\r\nto the peaceful intentions of their builders. Two of these became\r\nnoted. One was 'Moore's House' at West Point, used by Washington as\r\nhis headquarters during the whole, or a part, of the time he was\r\nstationed at West Point--from July 21, 1779, until November 28. The\r\nother was the 'Robinson House,' and was situated on the eastern shore\r\nof the Hudson, about two miles below West Point. It was used as a\r\nmilitary hospital and afterward as the headquarters of several\r\nsuccessive general officers, among whom was Benedict Arnold, who was\r\nin this house when apprised of Andre's capture. It was from this\r\nhouse that Arnold made his escape.\"\r\n\r\nThe Moore house stood in Washington Valley, near the river, a short\r\ndistance from the northeast corner of the present cemetery. It was\r\nbuilt prior to 1749, and was a pretentious structure for that period,\r\nbeing known as \"Moore's Folly.\"\r\n\r\nEvery foot of land in these Highlands has its memories of the\r\nRevolutionary War, and this town contains the culminating features of\r\nnative grandeur not only, but also the vital strategic point on the\r\nfamous river which figured so conspicuously in the war for\r\nindependence, and will continue to fill so many important pages of\r\nour national history for all time to come.\r\n\r\nThese great hills of grandeur and beauty extend along the entire\r\nriver front from Stony Point on the south to old Storm King on the\r\nnorth. Scientists tell us that these vast mountains of primitive rock\r\nare composed of granite, gneiss and syenite, with veins of trap. But\r\nregarding the formation of these towering masses of rock both\r\ngeologists and laymen have only speculated and guessed for more than\r\na century, as their descendants and successors will continue to do\r\nfor ages to come, and leave the maze of mystery as dark and deep as\r\never. We can only wonder and admire, while scientists wrestle with\r\nthe mighty problem of creation here presented.\r\n\r\nJust now, as the writer is gathering these data for this connected\r\nrecord, he finds that the great mystery concerning the formation of\r\nthis particular region has become even more obscure than ever through\r\nthe developments of the vast engineering project now under way off\r\nStorm King Mountain. In the effort to find a solid rock bottom\r\nbeneath the Hudson at this gate of the Highlands, through which to\r\nconstruct the great aqueduct which is to convey the Catskill Mountain\r\nwater to New York City, the engineers have bored the river bottom to\r\na depth of 700 feet, and are still baffled. Geologists predicted that\r\nthis rock would be found at least at 500 feet. But now they are all\r\nat sea and frankly admit that their supposed knowledge as to the bed\r\nof the Hudson at this point was totally wrong. Some expected that\r\nrock would be reached even at 100 feet. But now the engineers say\r\nthey may have to go down 4,000 feet before they can find proper rock\r\nthrough which to build their aqueduct which is to carry 800,000,000\r\ngallons of water daily at a pressure of 200 feet per square inch.\r\n{_sic_}  The old bed of the river is evidently covered with the\r\ndrift and silt of ages. And who will say when and how this vast body\r\nof water broke through these adamantine hills, or by what Cyclopean\r\nprocess of upheaval they were formed?\r\n\r\nThere are several small streams that flow into the Hudson at\r\ndifferent points in this town; one just south of Cro' Nest, others at\r\nHighland Falls and Fort Montgomery. The pretty cataract, called\r\n\"Buttermilk Falls,\" from its characteristic resemblance to that\r\nacidulous fluid, as it tumbles over the rocky shelves in fantastic\r\nglee in its haste to reach the river, is admired by every tourist.\r\nThere are also other streams which become tributaries of Popolopen's\r\nCreek, which finds the Hudson at Fort Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe town also contains many inland ponds or small lakes, such as Bog\r\nMeadow Pond, Round Pond, Long Pond, Cranberry Pond, Mine Pond,\r\nPopolopen Lake and Highland Lake. Strangely enough, many of these\r\nponds have been left without more appropriate names. This Highland\r\nLake, just south of Fort Montgomery, is about 150 feet above the\r\nHudson, and about half a mile long by one-eighth of a mile wide, and\r\nis fed by its own springs. \"Blood Lake\" and \"Hessian Lake\" are some\r\nof its more ancient appellations, bestowed, according to\r\nRevolutionary tradition, because of a company of Hessians who were\r\nslain there when Sir Henry Clinton captured Fort Montgomery.\r\n\r\nIt is now proposed by the New York authorities to locate a new State\r\nPrison in the vicinity of this lake, which is northwest of Iona\r\nIsland in the Hudson. Most of the region in that immediate section is\r\na wild rocky forest, and sparsely populated. Half a mile or more west\r\nof the river, however, there is a comparatively level plateau, some\r\n200 acres in extent, from which a fine view of both reaches of the\r\nHudson is obtained. This is included in the site which has been\r\nselected for the prison. Part of it, however, extends over into\r\nRockland County.\r\n\r\nThis property, which consists of some 500 acres, was purchased by the\r\nState for this prison site, in December, 1907, at a cost of $75,000.\r\nIt is about six miles below Highland Falls, and it includes Highland\r\nLake and its entire watershed. Whether the name of this new prison\r\nwill be selected from the classic nomenclature which prevails in that\r\nlocality, such as \"Doodletown,\" or \"Popolopen,\" remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Doodletown Bight,\" is the classic name handed down from the\r\nColonial period, which is here applied to a small bay in the Hudson\r\nwhere small water craft find a safe and pleasant harbor. The new\r\nState road which is to run from the New Jersey line to Albany, will\r\npass through the eastern side of this new prison tract. Bear\r\nMountain, on the west, has an inexhaustible supply of granite well\r\nsuited for building purposes.\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, the ancient records are almost devoid of names of\r\nearly settlers in this immediate region, and the presumption is that\r\nthese settlers were comparatively few. Major Boynton, in his history\r\nof West point says: \"The interval between the granting of the patents\r\nand the transfer of the titles, down to the period at which the\r\nAmerican Revolution commenced, are blanks in historical literature.\r\nNo traditions even of early settlers are extant, and the\r\nprobabilities are that, beyond a settlement made to secure a site or\r\ngrant, West Point, being in a region of stratified rocks, heavily\r\ncovered with drift deposits, and without a suitable soil for\r\ncultivation, remained a mere woodland tract, possessing no higher\r\nvalue than attaches to similar adjoining points in the Highlands\r\nwhich have remained unsettled and uncultivated to this day.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems well settled, however, that John Moore, the patentee, really\r\nlocated upon his purchase about 1725. This homestead stood in what\r\nhas since been known as Washington Valley, from the fact that\r\nWashington once occupied the same dwelling for a time. The original\r\nhouse, and even the second one, which replaced it, have long since\r\ndisappeared, but the remains of the old cellar were visible for many\r\nyears afterward. This, then, may be regarded as the first point of\r\nsettlement in the town of Highlands. The Moore descendants, though\r\ninclined toward loyalism, at the outbreak of the war, could not have\r\nbeen outspoken or turbulent in their opposition to the American\r\ncause, as their lands were not confiscated. They, however, soon fled\r\nto Nova Scotia, but afterward returned to the State of North\r\nCarolina, where some of them became prominent, one being elected\r\nGovernor of the State; and Stephen Moore sold the West Point\r\nreservation to the Government, as already stated. A daughter of John\r\nMoore married Hugh McClellan about the time the war broke out.\r\nAlthough not in the army, as a soldier, McClellan seems to have\r\nfought bravely against the invaders on his own hook, as it were, for\r\nthe records contain many instances of his personal prowess. He was\r\nemployed in hauling stone for the erection of Fort Putnam, and on one\r\noccasion he crossed the river alone and brought powder for the\r\nContinental Army at West Point at the risk of his life or capture.\r\n\r\nJames Denton, who came from Newburgh, seems to have settled at the\r\nPoint some time afterward. He had married into the McClellan family\r\nand became active in pressing the claim against the Government for\r\nthe title to the old homestead there by reason of possession. These\r\ndescendants also claimed certain rights which came from the Moore\r\nfamily direct and were not reserved in the deed to the Government,\r\nalthough antedating that transaction, as they contended. Then, too,\r\nit may be added in their behalf, the suit for ejectment was\r\nterminated by a compromise, the widow of McClellan being paid a\r\ncertain sum to surrender her claim.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Highland Falls Cornelius Swim seems to have been\r\nthe pioneer settler. This family originally came from England about\r\n1686 and settled on the east side of the Hudson opposite West Point,\r\nforming part of a colony there. They were offered an extensive tract\r\nof land there at that time for ten cents an acre. But not being\r\npossessed even of this modest amount of money, they were afterward\r\nobliged to leave when a more fortunate immigrant took the tract at\r\nfifteen cents per acre. The Swims, Faurots and Roses came to\r\nHighlands in 1725. Cornelius Swim had six sons and six daughters,\r\nmost of whom settled in the vicinity. He was finally killed by a\r\nBritish scout for refusing to tell where certain army supplies were\r\nhidden.\r\n\r\nCornelius Gee was another ante-Revolutionary settler at West Point,\r\nwho came from the Colony opposite. He afterward established a ferry\r\nfrom West Point, then known as \"Gee's Point,\" to Constitution Island\r\nopposite, being associated with Jacob Nelson in the enterprise. This\r\nwas called \"Nelson's Ferry.\" Nelson also lived in the colony on the\r\neast shore of the river opposite the Point and he had seven children.\r\nOnly one of these, however, seems to have settled on the west side of\r\nthe river. This ancient ferry is frequently mentioned in the\r\nRevolutionary annals; and Nelson's Point opposite Fort Arnold,\r\nafterward Fort Clinton, was regarded as a most important strategic\r\npoint by Washington, which he carefully guarded.\r\n\r\nTradition has a pleasant little Highland \"tea story\" connected with\r\nthis Gee family which may as well be perpetuated here. \"Aunt Sally\r\nGee\" was the happy possessor of half-a-pound of this most delectable\r\nand very scarce beverage that caused so much trouble between the\r\nmother country and her dependent Colonies on this side of the\r\nAtlantic, at the outbreak of hostilities. It is said that while the\r\nflames that were destroying Fort Montgomery illuminated this entire\r\nregion, announcing the triumph of the British forces, \"Aunt Sally\",\r\ngiving up all as lost, resolved upon having a final cup of tea to\r\nassuage her grief before fleeing for her life. Grabbing the old\r\nteapot from the shelf, she tossed the entire, half-pound of tea into\r\nit in her haste, determined that none should be left for the\r\nredcoats. But the decoction proved all too strong and bitter even for\r\nher tea-stained palate.\r\n\r\nAn early pioneer in the West Grove section was John Kronkhite, who\r\ncame, about the opening of the war, from Westchester County, N. Y.\r\nSome of his descendants are still in that region. Moses Clark was\r\nanother early settler there, whose name appears in the Cornwall\r\nrecords between 1765 and 1775, which would indicate that he arrived\r\nsome years before the war. Tobias Weygant is also mentioned as an\r\nearly West Grove settler. Among other early settlers in the town were\r\nThomas and Joseph Collins, William Cooper, who lived near Fort\r\nMontgomery, Thomas Cooper, Isaac Garrison, who lived in the Middle\r\nHighlands section, Jonas Garrison, William Horton, Zaccheus Horton,\r\nMaurice Havens, David June, who lived near the Rockland county line,\r\nD. Lancaster, John Parker, Israel Rose, Samuel Rockwell, S. Sheldon,\r\nBirdseye Young and James Stout. Isaac Faurot was also an ancient\r\nresident in the Highland Falls section, who was a deckhand on the\r\nfirst steamboat \"Cleremont\" that went up the Hudson under Captain\r\nWiswell in 1807. Captain Faurot, a descendant, is still a resident of\r\nHighland Falls.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE TOWN.\r\n\r\nLike several other of the younger towns in Orange county, Highlands\r\nwas the offspring of convenience and expediency. Its formation became\r\nin fact almost a matter of public necessity owing to the peculiar\r\nconditions prevailing. The old town of Cornwall consisted of a\r\nthickly settled region north of the mountains, and the widely\r\nseparated localities of Highland Falls and Fort Montgomery far to the\r\nsouth. Communication between these two ends of the township was in\r\nthose days very slow and inconvenient. The transaction of official\r\nbusiness of the town was very expensive and almost impracticable.\r\nBoats had to be chartered to carry voters to the town meetings. Thus\r\nthe division of the town, which was authorized by the county\r\nsupervisors in 1872, met with little opposition.\r\n\r\nThe first town meeting of the new town was held at the house of\r\nCharles Engleskircher, March 4, 1873. William Avery was then chosen\r\nthe first Supervisor, and a full list of town officials was selected.\r\nAvery was succeeded by Jeremiah Drew in 1874, who continued in the\r\noffice several years. John A. Cook held the office one term and was\r\nfollowed by Hon. Louis F. Goodsell, who was supervisor eighteen\r\nyears. Jacob L. Hicks was elected in 1905 and was succeeded by John\r\nF. Pierce in the closely contested election of 1907.\r\n\r\nVILLAGES OF THE TOWN.\r\n\r\nOf these, West Point, if it can be called a village, is the more\r\nimportant. A post-office was established here at an early period of\r\nthe nation's history. Major Roger Alden was the postmaster for some\r\nyears, and was followed by Mr. Hoh. In 1835 Prof. Claudius Berard\r\nsucceeded to the office and held it until his death in 1848. His\r\nwidow was then appointed and remained in office until 1870 when she\r\nwas succeeded by A. B. Berard, who was still there in 1880.\r\n\r\nThe place is composed almost entirely of the great Military School\r\nof the nation in all its varied departments and imposing structures.\r\nAside from this there is very little business, except that arising\r\nfrom the extensive improvements now in progress by the government.\r\nThe noted old West Point hotel is still standing, and in operation,\r\nalthough even this is soon to be demolished under the plans for the\r\nmodern reconstruction of the post, which are being carried out on a\r\nvast scale and at great expense.\r\n\r\nThe importance of West Point during the Revolutionary period is too\r\nwell understood by every student of our national history to need any\r\nfurther emphasis or exemplification in this connection. It is visited\r\nby thousands from every land annually as the great show-place of the\r\nnation and river. And the rare native charm of its location enshrines\r\nit as the beauty spot of America.\r\n\r\nBusy Highland Falls, adjoining West Point on the south, was\r\nincorporated in 1907. It is located on the Big Meadow Brook which\r\ntumbles over the rocks into the Hudson at this point in a most\r\nattractive cataract, which gave the village its name. It was first\r\nknown as \"Buttermilk Falls,\" under which name the post-office was\r\nestablished there July 14, 1849. Cornelius Nelson was the first\r\npostmaster, but President Buchanan removed him and appointed Timothy\r\nO'Leary in his place. He was reinstated, however, at the close of\r\nBuchanan's term, and held the office in all about thirty years.\r\nJoseph F. Stephens, the present postmaster was appointed in 1901.\r\nAlthough still invested with much historic charm because of its 200\r\nyears' existence, the village now presents a pleasing modern aspect.\r\nThere are many business houses, stores and shops. There are two\r\nnational banks, both organized in 1907. A library and reading room,\r\nand a village improvement society. A weekly newspaper was established\r\nin 1891. South of the village overlooking the Hudson are some\r\ncharming private residences including those of John Bigelow, Major\r\nGeneral Roe, ex-Senator Goodsell and J. Pierpont Morgan. The place is\r\na favored summer region because of its picturesque natural\r\nenvironment. The most imposing structure in the village is\r\nLadycliff Academy conducted by the Franciscan Sisters. This property\r\nwas originally Cozzen's and later Cranston's Hotel, and was purchased\r\nand opened for its present purpose in 1900. Extensive additions and\r\nimprovements have since been made. The enclosed grounds cover an area\r\nof twenty-two acres. There is an average attendance of one hundred\r\nand ninety pupils, and the regular courses give the education\r\nacquired in advanced high schools.\r\n\r\nThe old Revolutionary Fort Montgomery, which stood on Popolopen's\r\nCreek, where the stream empties into the Hudson, is perpetuated by a\r\nsmall hamlet with the same name. It makes no boast of its business\r\nimportance and points only to its patriotic history. It is, however,\r\nthe shipping point of large quantities of iron ore from the Forest of\r\nDean Mines some six miles west of this point.\r\n\r\nWest Grove is a pretty hamlet in the mountain section northwest of\r\nHighland Falls. It was settled at an early date and the environment\r\nis among some of the attractive lakes and ponds of the town.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS AND CHURCHES.\r\n\r\nFor the school records pertaining to this specific region between\r\n1813 and 1856, the reader is referred to the parent town of Cornwall.\r\nThere are three common school districts in the present town, in\r\naddition to the Post school at West Point which is maintained for the\r\nchildren of the soldiers and officers of the post. District No. 2\r\ncomprises the Highland Falls and Fort Montgomery schools. George\r\nW. Flood, school commissioner for the eastern district of Orange\r\nCounty, is a resident of Highland Falls.\r\n\r\nThe First Presbyterian Society was incorporated October 12, 1830,\r\nwith William Howe, of Buttermilk Falls, Samuel Spencer of West Point\r\nand Peter Meeks of West Grove as trustees. It was decided to erect\r\ntwo churches for the better convenience of the separate settlements,\r\none near Buttermilk Falls, and the other in the Fort Montgomery\r\nsection. These churches were open to other denominations under\r\ncertain regulations. In 1850 the society was reorganized under the\r\nname of \"The First Presbyterian Church of the Highlands.\" The\r\nfollowing trustees were then chosen: David Parry, Cornelius Nelson,\r\nCharles P. Smith, Alexander Mearns, and John M. Hall. The Rev. E. P.\r\nRoe, the famous novelist, who then lived on his fruit farm in\r\nCornwall, was the pastor of this church for several years, being\r\nsucceeded by Rev. Mr. Williams.\r\n\r\n_The First Methodist Church at Fort Montgomery_ was incorporated\r\nJanuary 11, 1831, with the following trustees: Thomas Potter,\r\nEbenezer Bull, Michael Jaquish, Hiram Tyler and Silas Rockwell. A\r\ncomfortable house of worship was built soon afterward.\r\n\r\n_The First Methodist Church_ at Buttermilk Falls began its career\r\nMarch 4, 1845, with Andrew Swim, David Parry, James Thackara,\r\nCharles P. Smith and Wright Dusenbury as trustees. But for some\r\nreason the society disbanded soon afterward and the members united\r\nwith other churches.\r\n\r\nThe present Methodist Church at the Falls came into existence some\r\nyears later, and it continues in a flourishing condition.\r\n\r\n_The Church of the Holy Innocents_ (Episcopal), at Highland Falls,\r\nwas incorporated September 13, 1850, Robert W. Weir and Thomas Webb\r\nbeing chosen wardens, and Dennis M. Mahar, W. H. C. Bartlett, A. E.\r\nChurch, Francis Rider, R. S. Agnew, Thomas Corris, B. R. Alden and\r\nR. S. Smith, vestrymen. The church building, which was erected\r\nlargely through the liberality of Prof. Weir of the Military Academy,\r\nwas completed in July, 1847, being constructed of the native granite.\r\n\r\n_The Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart_ was erected opposite the\r\nold Cozzens Hotel, at the Falls, in 1875, at a cost of $19,000. Rev.\r\nT. J. Early became the first settled pastor.\r\n\r\n\"MOLLY PITCHER.\"\r\n\r\nThe oft-told story of this stout, freckle-faced young Irish patriot\r\nof the Revolution is so closely identified with the ancient history\r\nof this locality, where she lived and died, that its omission here,\r\neven in this modern history, would be noted with regret.\r\n\r\nAt the capture of Fort Clinton by the British in October, 1777,\r\n\"Molly\" was \"in at the finish.\" When the enemy scaled the parapet,\r\nher husband, an artilleryman, dropped his portfire and fled. But\r\nMolly caught it up and discharged the last gun fired. Nine months\r\nlater, at the Monmouth battle, while she was devotedly bringing\r\nwater to her husband, who was serving a gun, he fell dead at her feet\r\nfrom a British shot. Although the officer in command ordered the\r\npiece withdrawn, Molly dropped her water-bucket, seized the rammer,\r\nand vowed she would fill her husband's place at the gun and thus\r\navenge his death. Next morning, covered with dirt and blood, she was\r\npresented to Washington by General Greene, and was appointed a\r\nsergeant and placed upon the half-pay list for life. She became a\r\nuniversal favorite with the army and usually appeared in artillery\r\ndress, with a cocked hat. She was afterward provided for at the\r\nPoint by the Government authorities and died in that vicinity about\r\nthe age of thirty-three.\r\n\r\nWEST POINT MILITARY ACADEMY.\r\n\r\nColonel Henry Knox, who was appointed chief of artillery by\r\nWashington in November, 1775, was the first to propose the\r\nestablishment of a military academy, of the Woolwich type, in this\r\ncountry. In a letter to his wife, dated September 5, 1776, he said:\r\n\"We must have a standing army. The militia get sick, or think\r\nthemselves so, and run home.\" Later in the same month, in a letter\r\nto Adams, he wrote: \"Military academies must be instituted at any\r\nexpense. We are fighting against a people well acquainted with the\r\ntheory and practice of war, and brave by discipline and habit.\"\r\n\r\nHere was the germ of the Military Academy of this nation. In the\r\nfollowing October a committee was appointed to \"prepare and bring in\r\na plan of a military academy at the army.\" The Post of West Point\r\nreceived its first garrison January 20, 1778, and work on Fort\r\nClinton was begun at once. There seems no room for doubt that in the\r\nvery midst of the Revolutionary War, at least as early as 1780, and\r\npossibly two years before, an engineer school was in operation at\r\nWest Point. There were also a laboratory and library, which was the\r\nparent of the present Academy Library, the oldest Government library\r\nin the United States. It is clear that military instruction of some\r\nsort had then begun. Early in 1783, when the success of the American\r\nRevolution was apparent, the necessity for this permanent school of\r\nmilitary education was still recognized. General Washington and his\r\nofficers were agreed upon the importance of some such school, and\r\nWest Point was generally regarded as the \"key to the United States.\"\r\nIn 1783 the necessity of retaining West Point for this purpose was\r\nurged upon Congress. General Knox, Secretary of War in 1790, again\r\nadvocated the scheme in his report, which was approved by Washington.\r\nBut it was not until March 16, 1802, that the organic act for the\r\nestablishment of the United States Military Academy was finally\r\npassed. This authorized the President to organize and establish a\r\ncorps of engineers at West Point which should constitute a Military\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nThus in 1802 ten Cadets of engineers were stationed at West Point\r\nwith their officers, which constituted the Military Academy there\r\nuntil 1812. This force was increased from time to time, and the sum\r\nof $25,000 was finally appropriated for the erection of suitable\r\nbuildings, and the provision of the library, apparatus and necessary\r\ninstruments for the use of the school.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this, however, while Washington, Randolph, Knox and\r\nHamilton strongly favored the West Point Academy plan, Jefferson\r\ndoubted the constitutionality of the scheme. But Washington was\r\ninclined to take the risk, and at his recommendation the West Point\r\nSchool was practically started in 1794, it being then held in the old\r\nprovost prison building, which was burned in April, 1796. The school\r\nseems to have begun in earnest, however, in February of that year.\r\nThe fire, which had destroyed all the books and apparatus, was\r\nthought to have been of incendiary origin, induced perhaps by\r\nopposition to the school. In the following May a parapet for the\r\npractice of field pieces, and some of the early wooden fortifications\r\nwere constructed.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1799, the superintendency of this academy, which\r\nhowever had not yet been legally established, was offered by\r\nPresident Adams to Count Rumford, the founder of the Royal Military\r\nAcademy of Munich. But nothing came of this ill-advised proposition.\r\nFor nearly 25 years Washington had labored to establish a National\r\nMilitary Academy, which he considered of primary importance.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 1801, Major Williams, a grand-nephew of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, took charge of the school as superintendent. Cadet John\r\nLillie, writing of his life there from 1801 to 1805, said: \"All\r\norder and regulation, either moral or religious, gave way to\r\nidleness, dissipation and irreligion. No control over the conduct of\r\nthe officers and cadets was exercised.\"\r\n\r\nAs already stated the academy was legally instituted March 16, 1802,\r\nand the school went into full operation on the 4th of the following\r\nJuly. But its ancient history really dates from 1776. The act of 1812\r\nestablished its present form, the main features of which have been\r\npractically adhered to to this day. Washington is still regarded as\r\nits founder, while Knox first proposed and strongly advocated a\r\nmilitary school of this very type, and Hamilton outlined the\r\nwell-considered plan of military education that was finally adopted\r\nand has been pursued ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF MINISINK.\r\n\r\nBy Charles E. Stickney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDERIVATION OF THE NAME.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the name Minisink is undoubtedly from the Delaware\r\nvalley, which was the \"Minisink\" country of its Indian owners. They\r\nhad a large village and castle on the Jersey side of the Delaware\r\nRiver, opposite a large island in the river, both that and the\r\nvillage being known to them and to the early white settlers by the\r\nname \"Minisink.\" They were a sub-division of the Lenni-Lenape tribe\r\nthat somehow became known later by the name of Delaware, from an\r\nEnglish lord, who visited the mouth of the river about five minutes\r\nonce, and left his unmerited name to the river and its valley as well\r\nas to the tribe of Indians about it. In truth a most foolish freak\r\nupon the part of the white people, who had far more deserving names\r\nto give, if they wished to observe and reward more daring explorers.\r\nFoolish, too, because the Indian names were just as beautiful, even\r\nmore so than that of the old lord.\r\n\r\nThis sub-division of the Lenni-Lenape Indians was called the Minsi\r\n(wolf), and they were easily recognized from other tribes by the\r\nwhite people. In 1663 when Wiltwyck (now Esopus or Rondout) was\r\nattacked, its white settlers declared that they saw the Munsey\r\n(Minsi) Indians among their assailants.\r\n\r\nIn front of their village on the river flats south of the island lay\r\ntheir great national cemetery covering acres of ground, where many\r\ngenerations of their nation lay entombed. Some of them were buried so\r\nclose to the river that the sweep of its current often washed away\r\nthe dirt and exposed their bones as the writer saw them. The early\r\nwhite people in the valley, all German, at first assumed that the\r\nname Minsi, pronounced by them \"munsey,\" was derived from the fact\r\nthat the water had at some time been drained by the Water Gap from\r\nthe lands in the valley and that the name was derived from \"the water\r\nis gone.\" We have never found any corroboration of that theory. The\r\nvillage was the source of the name, but what is meant in the\r\nLenni-Lenape language we probably shall never know. From their\r\nvillage the white settlers applied it to the whole valley.\r\n\r\nWilliam Tietsort, whom they induced to settle among them near present\r\nPort Jervis, and do their blacksmithing, in 1690, found the name\r\nthere. Arent Schuyler, who has left on record his diary of the visit\r\nhe made there to find whether the French spies had been there from\r\nCanada, said of it: \"1694 ye 6th, Tuesday, I continued my journey to\r\nMaghackemeck (Indian name for the neighborhood of the junction of the\r\nNeversink with the Delaware) and from thence to within half-a-day's\r\njourney of the Minisink.\" A half-day's journey would about represent\r\nthe distance to the village and castle of the tribe mentioned, and\r\nwhere he was bound.\r\n\r\nThe Indians who occupied the territory in these three towns were one\r\nof the three divisions of the Lenni-Lenapes. On the first map of the\r\ncountry made they were called Maquas, which was later corrected to\r\nMunseys and by the English to Minsies. The name of their\r\nheadquarters, Minisink, has come down to us from all the various\r\nlanguages spoken by white settlers as Minisink. That corroborates it\r\nas an original Indian word. Every clan or sub-division of the tribes\r\nused an accent of their own, so that they were easily distinguished,\r\nbut the difference was not so radical but that the whole Lenni-Lenape\r\npeople could understand each other. Therefore the name Minisink was a\r\nname known over a vast region before the white people came here. Its\r\nmeaning is a mystery which all linguists can guess at with some\r\nprobability of nearness.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION AND BOUNDARIES.\r\n\r\nJune 23rd, 1664, this region belonged to Holland, at least that\r\ncountry claimed it; but Charles, then King of England, deeded that\r\nday, to his brother, James, Duke of York, a tract \"to the northward\r\nas far as the northernmost branch of the Delaware River in 41\r\ndegrees and 40 minutes north latitude, thence in a straight line to\r\nHudson's River, to be called 'Nova Cesaria' or New Jersey.\" England\r\nsent over a fleet and captured the whole country in this vicinity a\r\nlittle later the same year, and that made the Duke's patent valid.\r\n\r\nThe region under consideration was then a dreary forest, but land\r\nspeculators soon began to deal in tracts of it, and New York Province\r\nclaimed that the line, 41.40 latitude north to the northernmost\r\nbranch of the Delaware River, ran from its beginning on Hudson's\r\nRiver to the mouth of the Lehigh River (which they asserted was the\r\nbranch of the Delaware referred to in the deed) where is now Easton,\r\nPa.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the owners of New Jersey claimed that the branch\r\nreferred to in the deed was a tributary of the Delaware River at what\r\nis now Cochecton, N. Y. It will be seen that this disputed territory\r\nwas of great extent, the apex of the triangle on the Hudson River\r\nwidening out to a base of near 50 miles from present Easton to\r\npresent Cochecton. In this triangle was comprised nearly all of what\r\nwe now call Sussex County, N. J., and, according to the New Jersey\r\nclaim, taking in the present city of Port Jervis and about all of the\r\npresent towns of Greenville and Minisink. The great dispute as to the\r\nownership of this triangle lasted for a hundred years and its tales\r\nof warfare and contests in courts are of great interest, but not\r\naltogether pertinent to our subject. The start upon Hudson's River is\r\nthus mentioned in N. J. Archives, Vol. I, page 531, in 1685-6:\r\n\"Gawen Lawrie of New Jersey, Governor Dongan of New York and others\"\r\nfixed at a point nigh Colonel William Merrit's house (see mention in\r\nfirst census of Orange County) on the west side of the Hudson River\r\nand \"marked with a penknife on a beech tree standing by a small run.\"\r\nHow different surveyors could locate the degree of latitude from\r\nthence to such widely different points was explained in old documents\r\nto be the fault of the crude quadrants then used.\r\n\r\nIn 1704 Queen Anne of England granted 23 persons a patent (deed), for\r\na tract of land which was named \"Minisink,\" because it embraced the\r\nland in Minisink along the Delaware River down as far as Big Minisink\r\nisland, and as far north as Peenpack (a nickname for the Gumaer\r\nsettlement on the Neversink). March 20th, 1765, Alexander Colden, of\r\nNew York, said of this patent, Vol. III, p. 988, Documentary History\r\nof New York: \"It contains not less than 250,000 acres, under the very\r\nsmall Quit-rent of nine pounds current money of this Province.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wawayanda patent had been granted the previous year (1703) to 12\r\nmen and the Minisink patent lapped upon it, hence we may well\r\nconclude that the quarrel between the Provinces of New York, New\r\nJersey, the owners of the Minisink patent and those of the Wawayanda\r\npatent made a very mixed question of title. There does not appear to\r\nhave been any severe contests in the three towns of which we write\r\nbetween individual land owners, except those of the large patents. In\r\n1767 the Provinces of New York and New Jersey appointed commissioners\r\nto run out a compromise line settled upon to run from the apex of the\r\ntriangle on Hudson River to the present station at Tri-states, which\r\nwas done and that line has since remained as the boundary between the\r\ntwo States. Titles derived from the Minisink patent south of that\r\nline were void, but the titles of landholders in the three towns were\r\nall derived from the New York patentees, hence there followed no\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution there were few changes in county matters, but\r\nMarch 7th, 1788, the legislature of the State enacted that\r\nsubdivisions of counties should be called towns instead of precincts.\r\nBy that act Orange County was divided into the towns of Haverstraw,\r\nOrangetown, Goshen, New Cornwall, Warwick and Minisink. The southern\r\nboundary of the latter was the State line of New York and New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe town of Minisink under that formation was bounded on the east by\r\nthe Wallkill River, northeast and north by the town of Wallkill and\r\nthe Ulster County line around on the northwest to the Delaware River,\r\nand the State line.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 the town of Deer Park was created and it cut off from\r\nMinisink its over-mountain lands, which had belonged to old\r\nMinisink and thus cut off the base whence the name had been derived.\r\nSince then the town has held to the name, a reminder of its old\r\nassociations and of being once the home of a part of the Minsi Indian\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 the town of Calhoun was formed principally from Deer Park and\r\nWallkill, and formed part of the boundary of Minisink on the north.\r\nIn 1833 the name of Calhoun was changed to Mount Hope.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 the town of Wawayanda was erected from the northeastern\r\nportion of Minisink, and took the place of Wallkill in the boundary\r\nof the former.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the town of Greenville was taken from the westerly portion of\r\nMinisink, and fixed the boundaries of the latter as they now are.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL.\r\n\r\nThe line between the States previously referred to on a westerly\r\ncourse has set-offs to avoid great obstacles in some places, but\r\nwhere it bounds Minisink it is a straight line. It crosses the\r\nWallkill a short distance south of Unionville.\r\n\r\nMillsburg, is a small village, named from the large mills once\r\nlocated on Bodinot's Creek at that place. Extensive saw-mills,\r\ngrist, cider, and plaster mills, were for a long time kept there by\r\nJohn Racine, and did a very large business for years after his death.\r\nThey are now gone. Down stream a short distance were other grist and\r\nsaw mills, of which one, a grist mill, is still in existence and\r\nmanaged by Frank Mead. A little farther down the stream were once\r\nvery large woolen carding and fulling mills, where cloth was made of\r\nthe finest quality. These are now in ruins.\r\n\r\nBoudinot's Creek has gone by various names, such as Indegot and\r\nBandegot, but antiquarians have now settled upon the derivation of\r\nthe name from Elias Boudinot, and the probabilities are that they are\r\nright. Elias was a merchant in New York City, and speculated in the\r\nlands out in the wilderness, as many others were doing in those\r\ntimes. The records show that he bought, June 10th, 1704, of Philip\r\nRokeby, one-third of his share in the Wawayanda patent; also, August\r\n8th, 1707, a twelfth part of the patent. He soon sold out his\r\ninterests in the patent and so far as we have been able to find,\r\nnever saw the creek in question, and he certainly never made a\r\nsettlement in this county.\r\n\r\nRutger's Creek was undoubtedly named from the circumstance of Anthony\r\nRutger's buying of the widow and son of John Merrit, one-half of the\r\none-twelfth of the Wawayanda patent allotted to Daniel Honan, who had\r\nin 1705 sold it to Merrit.\r\n\r\nThe creek in question rises in the town of Greenville and flows\r\neastward near Unionville, where it takes a northeasterly course\r\nthrough Waterloo Mills, Westtown, Johnson's, and then southerly\r\nthrough Gardnersville to the Wallkill. Its Indian name is not known.\r\n\r\nTunkamoose Creek, a small tributary of the Wallkill near Unionville,\r\nhas what is claimed to be an Indian name, but we cannot verify it.\r\n\r\nThe Wallkill is said by Haines to have drawn its name from some\r\nfamilies of Walloons who settled by it, and it has also had various\r\nother derivations alleged. Its Indian name is well known. In the very\r\nearly surveys about Franklin Furnace, N. J., in 1712-15, the\r\nsurveyors have written the name plainly, Twischsawkin. That this name\r\nwas not of a mere local application is shown by the fact that on a\r\nmap accompanying Smith's History of New Jersey, made and published in\r\nLondon, Charing Cross, by Wilham Faden, December 1st, 1777, from\r\nsurveys made in 1769 by the commissioners who ran the State line, the\r\nname Twischsawkin is applied to the stream. On that map there is not\r\na settlement marked from Goshen to Mackhackemeck in this county. In\r\nSussex County the settlement of the Walling brothers, where Joseph\r\nWalling kept an inn, now Hamburg, N. J., is marked \"Wallins.\" They\r\nwere located there somewhere about 1725-1730, and a brother settled\r\nin this town of Minisink at about the same time, by the river. We\r\ntake him to have been the first settler in the town, and mention is\r\nmade of him later. The true derivation of the name Wallkill is due to\r\ntheir settlements. The name \"Wallins\" was known far and wide to the\r\nstragglers who first came into the neighborhood and the river that\r\nran by their locations, first called by visitors, Wallinskill, about\r\n1750 got abbreviated to \"Wallkill.\" The Walloons spoken of by Haines\r\nwere undoubtedly \"Wallins.\" The Indian name Twischsawkin has been\r\ninterpreted to mean \"abundance of wild plums.\" A land abounding in\r\nsnakes comes nearer its true meaning in our study of the Minsi\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nUnionville village, assumed to be derived from the union of good\r\nfeelings following the settlement of the line between the States of\r\nNew York and New Jersey, is near that line, and is believed to have\r\nbeen settled about 1738. It now has three stores, two hotels, coal\r\nand feed stores, a system of waterworks owned by a private company,\r\nthree churches, and other places of business. It was incorporated as\r\na village in 1871, September 26th. Isaac Swift was the first\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nWesttown, a village so named because it was situated at the western\r\nlimit of the settlements when Goshen was headquarters of civilization\r\nin the county, has three stores, two churches, one hotel.\r\n\r\nJohnsons, so-named after William Johnson who gave the land for the\r\nMiddletown, Unionville & Water Gap Railroad when it passed through\r\nthe town where the depot is now located, has three good stores, two\r\nfeed and coal stores, one hotel, and Borden's large milk and cream\r\nplant, and is a place of considerable business.\r\n\r\nGardnersville, on Rutger's Creek, about two and a half miles\r\nsoutheast of Johnsons, is mostly in the town of Wawayanda, and\r\nderived its name from the Gardner family who once owned extensive\r\ngrist, saw and cider mills there. It is now mainly known from the\r\nfeed mills of John R. Manning, at present its principal industry. In\r\nthe early settlement of the country there was a defensive place near,\r\nknown as Fort Gardner. Its location is not precisely known. In some\r\nrecords it is spoken of as being southward from where Westtown now\r\nis. It was most probably at Gardnersville. An old stone building on\r\nthe late Lain farm is the \"Fort Gardner,\" says one tradition.\r\n\r\nWaterloo Mills (derivation of name unknown) since the decline of the\r\nmilling industry has nothing now to show of its former important\r\ngrist mills but the ruins.\r\n\r\nFIRST SETTLEMENT AND POPULATION.\r\n\r\nOf the first settler in the present territory of this county, Patrick\r\nMac Gregorie, whose brother-in-law, David Toshuck, is spoken of in\r\nRuttenber & Clark's History of Orange County (p. 13) as having\r\n\"closed his earthly career in the bosom of his family at Plum Point,\"\r\nwe desire to mention. In New Jersey Archives, Vol. I, p. 460, it\r\nsays: \"David Toshuck, of Moneyweard, partner with James, Earl of\r\nPerth, Captain Patrick Mac Gregorie, all sharers in Proprieties,\" were\r\nso mentioned in 1864. In a note on Vol. IX, p. 337, mention is made\r\nof the will of Edward Antill proven in New York, April 7th, 1725,\r\nwherein he gives his wife all his interest in a \"certain\r\nproprietorship formerly purchased of David Toshuck, laird of\r\nMinnevarre.\" On p. 338 it is stated that \"Edward Antill, Jr., came\r\ninto the possession of the laird of Minnevarre's broad acres at\r\nRaritan landing in Middlesex County where he spent the most of his\r\nlife.\" Donald Macquirrish, of Murderer's Creek, is mentioned with\r\nDavid Toshuck, of Minnevarre, Scotland, in a deed dated March 13th,\r\n1687. From all which we have doubts as to the death of the aforesaid\r\nDavid Toshuck at Plum Point.\r\n\r\nGovernor Dongan bought, October 25, 1684, of three Indians, one of\r\nwhom was Joghem or Keghgekapowell, for ninety pounds and eleven\r\nshillings in goods, all the land from the mouth of Murderer's Creek\r\non the Hudson, to a \"water pond upon the said hills called\r\nMeretange.\" The latter is the present Binnewater pond in Greenville.\r\nThis purchase embraced about thirty by forty miles of the territory\r\nof Orange precinct, and a part of the lands in three towns. It lapped\r\non other grants also. September 12, 1694, he sold it to Captain John\r\nEvans. In the latter sale went a house on Plum Point, which Captain\r\nMac Gregorie had built there on his land by advice of that very\r\nGovernor, who also sold the land without any scruple.\r\n\r\nLord Bellomont, in reviewing the transaction afterwards in writing\r\nJanuary 2, 1701, to the Lords of Trade, said:\r\n\r\n\"Capt. Evans's great grant of 40 miles one way and 30 another, has\r\nbut one house on it, or rather a hut, where a poor man lives, built\r\nby Patrick Mac Gregorie, a Scotchman, who was killed at the time of\r\nthe Revolution here, and his widow compelled to sell her house and\r\nland to Capt. Evans for 30 or 35 pounds.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing was not only a concise history of the first settlement\r\nin this county, but it was in reality the first census, and shows\r\nthat then, 1701, there was not a single person in the limits of our\r\nthree towns as a permanent settler. It may be said in apparent\r\ncontradiction that a census taken by Bellomont in 1698 showed this\r\ncounty to have in it 29 men, 31 women, 140 children and 19 Negroes.\r\nThey were all located along the Hudson River, in what is now Rockland\r\nCounty. Yet there was at that time a blacksmith, William Tietsort\r\n(Titsworth), in Minisink, near where Port Jervis now stands, who had\r\nsettled there in 1698 at the request of the Indians to work at his\r\ntrade for them. In 1703, the county had 268 people in it; in 1712,\r\n439. The Gumaer patent was settled on in the Neversink valley by this\r\ntime, but there is no record of any settler in our three towns at\r\nthat time. In 1723 the census showed 1,097 white and 147 colored\r\npeople in the county. The owners of the big patents used great\r\ninducements to get settlers to locate on their land, and it is\r\nprobable that some were in our territory but not of record. In 1737\r\nthere were 2,840; and in 1746, 3,268 people in the county.\r\n\r\nInman Walling was a settler, probably 1725-1730, by the Wallkill,\r\neast of present Westtown, and John Whitaker died in 1742 near where\r\nUnionville now is, and had been a resident there, no one knows how\r\nlong. His will on record in the surrogate's office in Goshen, liber\r\nA. page 221, mentions his wife Eve, sons Richard, Peter and John,\r\nand daughters Jean and Elizabeth. Their descendants are yet\r\nresidents of the town and of Sussex County adjoining. Those two\r\nfamilies were probably the first permanent ones in this town of\r\nMinisink. There were others in the limits of what is now Wawayanda\r\nat or about the same time.\r\n\r\nThere were two Smith families early in the precinct of Minisink. One\r\nof them, Benjamin, settled near the present Slate Hill village, and\r\nthe other on the farm now owned by J. Cadigan near Johnsons, where he\r\nkept an inn, the place being known as Smith's Village for at least\r\nseventy-five years.\r\n\r\nOther settlers came in rapidly. William Stenard in 1749; Captain John\r\nWisner from Warwick in 1776; George Kimber in 1750; Caleb Clark in\r\n1800; William Lane in 1760. In an assessment roll made for Goshen\r\nprecinct in 1775 Godfrey Lutes, Peter Middagh, Daniel Rosencrans,\r\nInman Walling, Peter Walling, Increase Mather, John Whitaker, Jr.,\r\nand Ebenezer Beers were shown to reside in this town besides the\r\nother first settlers mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe census of the county in 1756 showed it to have a population of\r\n4,446 whites and 430 slaves. In 1771 there were 9,430 whites and 662\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nThe Horton family were early residents of this territory, but we have\r\nno positive data of their first advent. October 20, 1764, a line run\r\nto divide the county into two precincts was described as \"beginning\r\nnear the new dwelling house of John Manno, and thence on a course\r\nwhich will leave the house of Barnabus Horton, Jr., ten chains to the\r\nwestward.\" His house we do not think was in this town. A Barnabus\r\nHorton in 1813 lived near what is now South Centerville in Wawayanda.\r\nGabriel Horton, justice of the peace, 1839-1843, lived about a mile\r\nand a half west of present Slate Hill in Wawayanda. William Horton in\r\nthis town was a holder of important local offices, and his son\r\nCharles W. Horton, former supervisor, is now one of the leading\r\ncitizens, as is also his neighbor, Reeves Horton.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, ten years after the town of Calhoun (Mount Hope) had been\r\nset off, the remainder of the territory in old Minisink had 4,439\r\ninhabitants, and the present limits of this town about 1,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the town of Wawayanda was taken off, and in 1853 the town of\r\nGreenville. In 1855, by the first census after their elimination,\r\nthis town had a population of 1,295.\r\n\r\nSince then its limits have remained unchanged. In 1860 its population\r\nwas 1,266; in 1865, 1,209, a decrease owing to the civil war; in\r\n1880, 1,360, including the incorporated village of Unionville, which\r\nhad 316; in 1905, the last census taken, 1,354, including\r\nUnionville--a gain in 50 years of 59, which may be mainly said to be\r\nin Unionville.\r\n\r\nThe first incorporated company to do business in the town was the\r\nGoshen and Westtown Turnpike Company, chartered June 1, 1812,\r\nconsisting of Reuben Hopkins, Freegift Tuthill, Benjamin Strong,\r\nStephen Jackson, James Carpenter, D. M. Westcott, \"and such other\r\npersons as they shall associate with them.\" The purpose was to build\r\na turnpike road from the State line to Rutger's Kill near the mill of\r\nJones & Vancleft (at Gardnersville). Thence it ran to Pellet's round\r\nhill and the Goshen and Minisink turnpike.\r\n\r\nThe Middletown, Unionville & Watergap Railroad Company was\r\nincorporated and completed ready for business by June 10, 1868, from\r\nUnionville to Middletown. Later it was leased to the Oswego Midland\r\nRailway, and still later its 13.30 miles of track were leased by the\r\nNew York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad Company, by which it is now\r\noperated, under Erie Railroad supervision.\r\n\r\nMILITARY.\r\n\r\nThere appear to have been no conflicts with the Indian owners of the\r\nterritory of the three towns under consideration, and its white\r\nsettlers, previous to the Minisink war, or as some historians call\r\nit, \"The French and Indian War\" of 1754-1758. We call it the Minisink\r\nwar, because the Minsi tribe, at the outset of the war between France\r\nand England, which led to the great struggle between Canada for\r\nFrance and the colonies of our country for England, got permission to\r\ntake up the hatchet against the settlers in Pennsylvania Minisink\r\nfrom their (the Minsis') masters, the Six Nations, to avenge their\r\nwrongs in that region. The wrongs were alleged to be that the\r\nproprietors of Pennsylvania had cheated the Indian owners of the\r\nlands there, and there is now no doubt that the allegation was true.\r\nThere was no redress to be had for an Indian wrong in those years.\r\nTeedyuscung and the leaders of the Indians issued imperative orders\r\nthat the war should be confined to Pennsylvania and they were pretty\r\ngenerally obeyed. Occasional straggling parties of them, however, in\r\nsmall numbers, disobeyed orders in order to avenge some injury to\r\nsome person or clan, and passed through east of Shawangunk Mountains\r\non marauding expeditions. They were vagrant Indians who had no\r\nstanding as warriors in their tribe and they perpetrated wanton\r\nmurders without the knowledge or sanction of their leaders. Of this\r\nclass no doubt were the ones who surprised a man named Owens at work\r\nin Dolsen's meadow, in what was then Dolsentown, now in Wawayanda,\r\nnear Middletown, in 1756, and shot him. David Cooley, who is believed\r\nthen to have had a settlement at what is now the Charles O.\r\nCarpenter farm near Pine Hill cemetery, about a mile south of where\r\nDolsen was located, alarmed at the murder of Owens, moved his family\r\nto Goshen. The next spring he moved back. That summer a party of\r\nIndians, in passing by his place, shot a woman of his household who\r\nat the time was passing from the outdoor oven to the house.\r\n\r\nA company of militia had been organized in 1738 in the county called\r\nthe \"Company of the Wallakill (Willinskill)\"; but none of the 144\r\nnames of its members appear to belong to our territory, except it may\r\nbe those of John Monell, Lieutenant William Borland, Benjamin Haines,\r\nJames Monell, Johannis Crane and James Davis. John Bayard was its\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the widow Walling in 1758 was mentioned in the\r\nPhiladelphia _Gazette_ and in New York papers in that year and made\r\na profound impression throughout the colonies.\r\n\r\nIn the Revolutionary War, Colonel Allison's Goshen regiment contained\r\nsome names belonging to this territory. The officers of its Wawayanda\r\ncompany were: Captain, William Blair; lieutenants, Thomas Wisner and\r\nThomas Sayre, Jr.; ensign, Richard Johnson; of the Drowned Lands\r\ncompany--captain, Samuel Jones; lieutenants, Peter Gale and Jacob\r\nDunning; ensign, Samuel Webb; of the Pochuck company--captain,\r\nEbenezer Owen; lieutenants, Increase Holley and John Bronson; ensign,\r\nDavid Rogers; of Minisink company--captain, Moses Courtright;\r\nlieutenants, John Van Tile and Johannes Decker; ensign, Ephraim\r\nMiddaugh. The latter lived in the township of Wantage in 1764, where\r\nhe was commissioned as an ensign of Captain Kirkendal's company by\r\nGovernor William Franklin. The late S. M. Stoddard of that township\r\nhad and exhibited to the writer the last named commission. Middaugh\r\nwent with General Hathorn to the battle of Minisink, where he was\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThe town of Minisink was bonded in 1869, for $75,000 to aid in\r\nextending the New York Midland Railroad from Unionville farther\r\nsouth. This has not been paid in full yet. The sum of $3,280 was\r\nordered to be raised by tax on the town of Minisink by the board of\r\nsupervisors on the 22nd of November, 1907, to pay principal and\r\ninterest on those bonds.\r\n\r\nThe first town meeting after the town of Minisink was organized, took\r\nplace at the house of John Van Tuyl, April 1, 1789. Its territory\r\nthen covered the three towns, and that house supposed to be the old\r\nstone house now in Greenville, on the former Jonathan Van Tuyl farm,\r\nlater the Hallock house, was a convenient place for the gathering.\r\n\r\nAugust 11, 1864, the present town was bonded for $25,000 to pay\r\nbounties for volunteers in the Civil War. It was paid off, principal\r\nand interest, in eight equal installments as they fell due.\r\n\r\nHulet Clark bought land in Minisink in 1828 in the present town of\r\nMinisink, where he died March 31, 1857. His son, William Harvey\r\nClark, early gave evidence of the good judgment and business ability\r\nwhich his future life carried out. He married Emily Robertson of\r\nWawayanda and they lived on the old homestead near Westtown, where he\r\ndied in 1907. His son, Robert H. Clark, is the present supervisor of\r\nthis town, resides on the old homestead, and is establishing a\r\nbusiness reputation as popular and able as that which distinguished\r\nhis father and which will make his name long remembered in local\r\nannals.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1799, the Legislature of the State passed an act for the\r\ngradual abolition of slavery. All slaves were to become free at a\r\ncertain age. As an instance of its working, there was Frank Bounty,\r\na colored man, for whom Joseph Davis of Wawayanda had traded a pair\r\nof oxen when Frank was a young man. When the time arrived at which\r\nthe law gave Frank his liberty he was called up by Mr. Davis and told\r\nthat he was then a free man. Frank asked him if he could not stay on\r\nwith him, but Mr. Davis said he could not, for the reason that people\r\nwould then say that he was being coerced. Mr. Davis gave him some\r\nmoney and told him he must go and do for himself, and Frank told the\r\nWriter that was one of the saddest days of his life.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis also gave him the use of a house and lot in Brookfield or\r\nSlate Hill which he might, and did, enjoy for life by paying the\r\ntaxes on it. It was the last house on the west side of the street in\r\nthe west end of the village at that time. There he raised a large\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nNot all Negroes were so lucky. Some of them were old and worn out and\r\ntheir masters were glad to get rid of caring for them.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of the town in all its farming communities, the\r\nfarmers raised sheep, and made a double use of them. The rams were\r\nused to churn with on the big wheel and on endless chain churning\r\nmachines then used, and the wool sheared from all the sheep was\r\ncarded, sometimes by hand, at other times in factories, and woven or\r\nspun into stockings, mittens, and cloth, to furnish wearing apparel.\r\nUp to 1850, butter was the chief product of the dairies in the town.\r\nThen selling milk came into general practice, and making butter,\r\nmilling flour for home use, and traveling on horseback went out of\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nThe farmers universally kept sheep, raised the wool to make the\r\nclothes for the members of the family, and at the same time used the\r\nlarge sheep to churn with upon a tread or sweep power. Up to 1850\r\nbutter and hogs were the chief products. It is less than 200 years\r\nsince the first squatters settled in the limits of the three towns of\r\nwhich we write. The first customs to pass away were their friendly\r\nassociations with the few Indians who clung to their old hunting\r\ngrounds with death-like tenacity. Then the hostilities engendered by\r\nthe helplessness of the Indians and the consequent overbearing\r\nattitude of the settlers passed by, leaving a trail of traditions and\r\nsavage memories. Then followed the old logging, stone picking,\r\nmowing, husking and quilting bees or frolics in which whiskey was\r\nused as a general beverage. Then came the passing of the use of\r\nwhiskey for the universal medicine and social welcome. Next passed\r\nthe days when women carded the wool and spun and wove it, and knit\r\neverywhere, knit, knit, knit. Next passed the days when the young\r\nladies worked samplers, and helped in the harvest and hay fields,\r\nand grew up vigorous, stout and healthy. Next passed the fishing with\r\nfikes {_sic_} and racks and the hunting for wolves and foxes. Now have\r\narrived the days when fish and game are about extinct.\r\n\r\nNow are the days when the farmers sell their milk and buy their\r\nbutter; when they sell little else than milk and have become a great\r\ngeneration of buyers; when social visits are about unknown; when the\r\nold time good-natured sports and merriment are frowned upon; when men\r\nno longer meet on the streets and argue politics, but bury themselves\r\nin a newspaper on the trains or in any resting place and read, read,\r\nread; when women no longer knit and spin; when the girls no longer\r\nwill do outdoor work and dreadfully dislike to do indoor work; when,\r\ninstead of the big boys and girls going to school a few months in the\r\nwinter season, they all go away to boarding school. In noting these\r\nand other changes which have taken place in the towns as the years\r\nhave fled, it is noticeable that the people generally live better,\r\neven luxuriously, compared with former years, but are their public\r\nand domestic relations happier?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF MONROE.\r\n\r\nBy M. N. Kane.\r\n\r\nThe territory comprising the present town of Monroe is part of the\r\nChesekook Patent granted by Queen Anne, March 25, 1707. The\r\nChesekook tract was surveyed by Charles Clinton, father of George\r\nand James Clinton, and grandfather of Dewitt Clinton. His field book,\r\nthe original of which is in the possession of Hon. MacGrane Cox, of\r\nSouthfield, N. Y. (Mr. Fred J. Knight, Civil Engineer, of Monroe,\r\nN. Y., having a copy), contains much information and many interesting\r\nincidents of the early history of this section.\r\n\r\nThe town was set off from the precinct of Goshen in 1764 and named\r\nChesekook. This name continued until 1801, when it was changed to\r\nSouthfield. On April 6th, 1808, it took the present name Monroe, in\r\nhonor of James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, the town (like ancient Gaul), was divided into three parts\r\nby the erection of the three towns of Monroe, Highland and\r\nSouthfield, which division was the same as the present towns of\r\nMonroe, Woodbury and Tuxedo, except that the then town of Monroe\r\nembraced a small portion of the present town of Woodbury.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the three towns were dissolved and the whole original\r\nterritory restored to the town of Monroe. In 1889 it again underwent\r\nthe Gaelic operation resulting in the creation of the present towns\r\nof Monroe, Woodbury and Tuxedo. Monroe contains an area of 11,500\r\nacres, Woodbury 23,000 acres and Tuxedo 50,000 acres.\r\n\r\nThe history of this town was written by Rev. Daniel Niles Freeland,\r\nwho was the beloved and scholarly pastor of the Presbyterian Church\r\nfrom 1847 to 1881, and his volume of two hundred and fifty pages,\r\nentitled \"Chronicles of Monroe in the Olden Times,\" is a history of\r\nthe town up to 1898.\r\n\r\nLAKES AND MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nMonroe has in recent years, because of its rugged beauties, its\r\nbeautiful lakes and mountain scenery, its high altitude, pure water\r\nand healthfulness, and its proximity to the Metropolitan district,\r\nbecome a favorite resort for the people of New York and nearby\r\ncities, and has made very rapid growth. It is the lake region of the\r\ncounty and located on the crest of the mountain divide, the village\r\nbeing the highest station except Otisville on the Erie Railroad\r\nbetween Jersey City and Port Jervis. There are four beautiful natural\r\nlakes, located from one to three miles from the village, namely,\r\nMombasha, having an area of 340 acres and an elevation of 860 feet,\r\nfrom which Monroe village gets it water supply; Walton Lake, having\r\nan area of 125 acres and an elevation of 720 feet, from which Chester\r\nobtains its water supply; Round Island Lake, ninety acres in area and\r\n660 feet elevation, upon the eastern bluff of which Mr. W. M.\r\nHaight's beautiful Cedar Cliff Inn is located, and Cromwell Lake with\r\nan area of fifty-three acres and an elevation of 740 feet. There are\r\na number of smaller lakes which add to the beauty of this region.\r\nAmong them should be mentioned, the Mountain Lake recently built to\r\nthe east of the village, with an area of twenty acres and an\r\nelevation of 550 feet, and Lake Winape, a most charming mountain lake\r\nnear Mombasha Lake, with an area of eleven acres and an elevation of\r\n760 feet, just completed by Mr. George R. Conklin. The construction\r\nof other lakes is contemplated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. N. Kane.]\r\n\r\nThe village of Monroe is in the pass on the mountain crest, the\r\nwaters from the northern part of the village flowing northeast into\r\nthe Hudson near Newburgh, and from the southern part of the village\r\nflowing southeast through the Ramapo, which rises in Round Island\r\nLake, into the Passaic River.\r\n\r\nEager, in his early history of Orange County, with prophetic vision,\r\nsaw the beauties of this section. He wrote as follows: \"These are the\r\nGrampian hills of Orange. While this elevated range is severed by\r\nmany deep glens and valleys, the Alpine heights hold within their\r\nrocky crests, ponds and lakes of pure water, which glitter like\r\ndiamonds in the noontide sun. Rude and forbidding as this region of\r\nhills and rocks and mountain crags may at first sight appear to the\r\neye of a superficial observer, yet, to the true lover of nature in\r\nthe exhibition of her noblest works, and to the practical mind of the\r\nreally utilitarian, for a thousand purposes, the whole is well\r\narranged and unsurpassed by anything of the kind in the county. Here\r\nare found without stint or measure, granite, mica or isinglass stone,\r\nand every quality of iron ore, with other minerals, treasures of\r\npresent and future wealth to the nation. As early as 1778, during the\r\nwar of the Revolution, the great chain passed across the Hudson at\r\nWest Point, was made from the mineral of this region. In this\r\nrespect as regards quality and quantity, the county of Orange stands\r\nunrivaled by any other in the State.\r\n\r\n\"The time will come when these hills, mountains, deep glens and\r\nsparkling lakes, shall be the descriptive themes of some native bard,\r\nwho like Scott or Burns, caught up in spirit and wrapped in poetic\r\nfire, will harmoniously weave them, one and all, into the thrilling\r\nlays of the lowland and mountain muse. The time will come, when these\r\nelevated heights of dreary aspect, these hills overhung and darkened\r\nwith vines and forest trees, and these lakes of picturesque beauty,\r\nunknown to the common mind, decorated with the wildest garniture of\r\nnature, and visited by the wing of the wild bird, shall be associated\r\nin the minds of our children's children with all that is pastoral,\r\npleasing and heroic. True, Monroe cannot be made equal in\r\nagricultural beauty to other more charming localities, and wave with\r\na golden harvest; for though her hills and mountains may be denuded\r\nof their vegetable ornaments, they cannot be leveled down nor driven\r\nover by the plough-share; yet the time will come, when every nook and\r\ncorner throughout the broad and variegated mass shall hold a\r\nfreeman's cottage, teeming with life and highland cheer, whose\r\ntenants, honest and hardy, will sleep amidst the thunders which rock\r\nthem to rest, and the lightnings that play around and gleam up their\r\nmountain dwellings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Freeland in writing of its mountains says: \"As the\r\nmountains were round about Jerusalem,\" so are the mountains round\r\nabout Monroe. On the east are the Highlands, like the mountains of\r\nMoab, seen whenever its citizens look toward sunrise. Ten miles of\r\nrock ridges, with many a peak, defend them on that side. Only one or\r\ntwo passes give access in that direction--one over Bull Hill, the\r\nother up to the Stockbridge Hotel. Either of these could easily be\r\ndefended against an enemy. On the south are Forshee Hill and the\r\nSouthfield Mountains. On the west, the Bellvale Mountains and\r\nSugar Loaf, standing like a sentinel, overlooking the valley below.\r\nSchunnemunk guards the northwest. It has a bastion on the eastern\r\ncorner. High Point is a weather signal-tower to the observing. When\r\nit wears its night-cap late in the morning, it indicates falling\r\nweather; when the cap is early doffed, it betokens a serene day. The\r\nblack rocks loom up from the mountain-top, and from their summit a\r\nwonderful scene presents itself. The eye sweeps the entire horizon,\r\ntaking in the Catskills, Butter Hill, the Fishkill Hills, Bull and\r\nPine Hills, Mount Bashan, Sugar Loaf, Bellvale and Goose Pond\r\nMountains, with lakes, farms, mines, mills and villages galore. The\r\nDevil's Racecourse lies on the northern slope of old Schunnemunk, but\r\nthe visitor needs none of his counsel or company, for he who climbs\r\nthese steeps can find sweeter communion nearer to the heart of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\"One other landmark is Bald Hill, very dear to us because at its foot\r\nwe first hung the crane. Here we toiled and studied, and here the\r\nsunshine lingers in our memory longest and our children fell asleep.\r\nIt is the Acropolis of the village.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in writing of its valleys he says: \"Soils of great fertility\r\nwere laid down here; yes, brought from distant hills to furnish slope\r\nand meadow. Here are alluvions of great depth and good grain lands;\r\nbut the town is best adapted to grazing. The grasses, like those of\r\nthe Blue Grass region of Kentucky, contain just those elements which\r\nyield fattening and milk-producing qualities. Had the mountains of\r\nMonroe been only a mass of rock, like some parts of Scotland, they\r\nmight have been abandoned to the heather and become great solitary\r\nsheep-walks; or if they had been only picturesque vales and quiet\r\nnooks, there would have been a temptation to some lord of the manor\r\nto make it his park and country-seat. Heaven had a better destiny in\r\nstore for it, hence mingled rocks and soils so as to invite the plow,\r\nscooped out the water courses to attract the loom and forge, hid away\r\nsuch materials as would bring hither the herd-man and artisan, the\r\nabhorrence of lordly pretension and elegant leisure. Monroe, from its\r\nvery physical constitution, was predestined to be the home of honest\r\ntoil and frugal industry. In the vicinity of what was to be the\r\ngreatest city of the New World, and on the route of its best\r\napproaches from west to north, wealth and prosperity ought to be its\r\nsure reward, and doubtless will when the wisdom of men is able to\r\nmaster the situation.\"\r\n\r\nMONROE VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nBut the growth and development of Monroe depends not alone upon its\r\npicturesque mountains, beautiful valleys and charming lakes, which\r\nattract so many city people, who are fast dotting the available lake\r\nand mountain sites with charming villas and country homes, beautiful\r\ninns, hotels and boarding houses, for the village itself is becoming\r\none of the most progressive and bustling of modern towns. Its growth\r\nduring the past five years being much more rapid than any other\r\nvillage of the county.\r\n\r\nMonroe village, incorporated in 1894, with a population of 781, now\r\nhas about 1,200. The incorporation was due in a large degree to a\r\ndisastrous fire occurring in November, 1892, which showed the\r\nnecessity of fire protection.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 1894, a vote on the question of incorporation was taken,\r\nresulting in favor of incorporation 111 for, and 45 against. On\r\nAugust 21, 1894, an election for officers was held. Henry Mapes was\r\nelected president; George R. Conklin, Gilbert Carpenter and Henry\r\nMorehouse, trustees, and J. Lester Gregory, treasurer. On August\r\n28th the Board organized as a board of water commissioners with\r\nGilbert Carpenter, president. At the election held November 10, 1894,\r\nto vote for waterworks, there were fifty-eight for and fifteen\r\nagainst the proposition. The board of water commissioners took the\r\nnecessary steps to acquire water for the village, and the village of\r\nMonroe is largely indebted to this first board of water commissioners\r\nfor its splendid water plant which is contributing so largely to its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe village purchased from the Sterling Iron & Railway Company the\r\nright to raise the dam and store additional water at Mombasha Lake.\r\nThis lake affords one of the purest and finest water supplies to be\r\nfound in the State. About one mile of 14 inch pipe and two miles of\r\n10 inch pipe bring the water to the center of the village with a head\r\nof about 250 feet, and distribution is made with 8, 6 and 4 inch\r\npipes. The water was turned on October 10, 1895. No fire has since\r\nextended beyond the building in which it originated. The cost of the\r\nworks was about $46,000, which is probably about two-thirds of what\r\nit would cost at present, owing to the increased cost of labor and\r\nmaterial. The works are now not only self-sustaining but are\r\nproducing a comfortable surplus, and it is estimated that in not many\r\nyears the plant will pay for itself and will then produce sufficient\r\nrevenue to light and keep in repair the village streets--a splendid\r\nexample of municipal ownership of public utilities.\r\n\r\nThe town of Monroe has no bonded indebtedness and the village none\r\nother than its water bonds, except that Union Free School District\r\nNo. 1, which includes the village, has issued $4,375, on account of\r\nthe purchase of a seven acre school site on a commanding height\r\noverlooking the village.\r\n\r\nThe Warwick, Monroe and Chester Building and Loan Association has\r\nbeen a potent factor in Monroe's development. It was organized in\r\nApril, 1890.\r\n\r\nStandard Lodge No. 711 F. & A. M., instituted at Chester, N. Y.,\r\nJune 30, 1871, was, with consent of the Grand Lodge, moved to Monroe\r\nin 1884, and has a membership of 180.\r\n\r\nThe Monroe National Bank, U. S. No. 7,563, although in its infancy,\r\nis a flourishing institution. It was chartered by the Treasury\r\nDepartment January 18th, 1905 and it was opened for business, March\r\n1st, 1905.\r\n\r\nMonroe has a very excellent fire department. The Mombasha Hose\r\nCompany was organized July 24th, 1895, and the Mombasha Fire Company,\r\nApril 5th, 1898.\r\n\r\nThe Orange and Rockland Electric Light and Power Company, which\r\nfurnishes light and power to the villages and communities in the\r\neastern end of the county, is located at Monroe and is now erecting\r\na very large plant. The Newbury Foundry Company is also located here.\r\n\r\nMonroe has a fine telephone system, an athletic association, and is\r\nnow putting down cement walks in the village, and it is confidently\r\npredicted that it will be the leading center of the eastern end of\r\nthe county within a short period.\r\n\r\nA Methodist society existed in the neighborhood of Monroe prior to\r\n1839, the M. E. Church at Oxford (near Quaker Hill) having been built\r\nsome time before, but in the year above mentioned Matthew B. Sweezy\r\ndeeded to the Trustees of the recently organized M. E. Church of\r\nMonroe the land upon which the church now stands. In the following\r\nyear, 1840, the church was built. The first board of trustees was the\r\nfollowing: Stephen Post, Isaac Compton, Jeremiah Knight, Thomas D.\r\nTannery, John King, Samuel Smith and Peter Ball. Others who served\r\nthe church in its early history as trustees were Jonathan Mapes,\r\nJohn S. Gregory, Matthew B. Sweezy, Solomon W. Esray, Townsend Mapes,\r\nJob Mapes, William Hudson, George K. Smith, William Johnston, Martin\r\nKonnight, Daniel Secord, Nathan Strong and Walter Roberts. John S.\r\nGregory was elected trustee in 1843 and served in this capacity until\r\nhis death in 1905, a period of sixty-two years.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Bancroft is said to have been the first minister. Others\r\nwho followed him were the Rev. William Van Duzen, Rev. A. C. Fields,\r\nRev. Mr. Newmans, Rev. J. H. Hawkshurst, Rev. Mr. Blake, Rev. Mr.\r\nCroft, Rev. N. Messiter, Rev. D. D. Gillespie.\r\n\r\nMatthew B. Sweezy was chorister for a time. There was no organ in the\r\nearly days of the church, but the congregation was frequently led in\r\nsinging by the violin and the violoncello, though there were some who\r\nobjected to the use of so ungodly a thing as the \"fiddle.\"\r\n\r\nAt first the Monroe church was a part of the circuit under the charge\r\nof a pastor and his assistants. This circuit in the early days\r\ncomprised, besides Monroe, the churches at Highland Mills,\r\nWashingtonville, Craigville and Turner. Finally, Monroe and Turner\r\ncomprised the charge, and this relationship was dissolved in 1895.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 it was voted to enlarge and repair the church, and the\r\npastor, Rev. David McCartney, and Mr. H. H. Lawrence, were appointed\r\na committee to solicit subscriptions for this purpose. Their efforts\r\nwere successful and the church was remodeled, and stands to-day\r\npractically the same as they left it.\r\n\r\nThe church has reason to hold the memory of Mr. James Smith, Mrs.\r\nJames Smith and Sara Smith, their daughter, in lasting remembrance,\r\nas they respectively left substantial legacies to the trustees of the\r\nchurch, to the Ladies' Aid Society, and to the Sunday school, said\r\nlegacies to be held in trust for their use.\r\n\r\nThe church has a Sunday school and Epworth league. The\r\nsuperintendents of the Sunday school during the last twenty-five\r\nyears or more have been Franklin Bull and Orville Eichenberg, the\r\nlatter having held the position for the last nineteen years.\r\n\r\nThe first available records of the schools of the town of Monroe are\r\ndated January 7, 1819. These are receipts given by the trustees of\r\nseveral of the school districts for State moneys received from the\r\ncommissioners of common schools. These moneys were for the benefit of\r\ntheir respective districts and were in all cases small, the\r\napportionments ranging from eight to twenty-five dollars. At this\r\ntime the town's educational interests were in the hands of three\r\ncommissioners of common schools. The incumbents of these offices in\r\nthe town of Monroe in 1819 were Israel Green, Lewis H. Roe and George\r\nWilks.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the office of town superintendent was instituted, thus doing\r\naway with the board of three commissioners of common schools. The\r\nduties of this officer were probably the same as those exercised by\r\nthe board which he had taken the place of. The first person to hold\r\nthis new town office was Joseph R. Andrews, who had been a member of\r\nthe last board of commissioners of common schools. The office of town\r\nsuperintendent ceased to exist in 1857, when the office of school\r\ncommissioner was created. The new official assumed the powers of\r\nlicensing teachers, altering school district boundaries, etc., while\r\nthe care of the school moneys from the State was given to the\r\nsupervisor of the town. The office of town superintendent was held\r\nfor a short time by Morgan Shuit, and afterward for a period of\r\nabout ten years by Archibald Campbell, whose term was concluded in\r\n1857, when the office was abolished.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, as they did in subsequent years, the commissioners reported\r\nthe text-books in use. This list varied little for many years and was\r\ngiven in the following order: Webster's Spelling Book, Murray's\r\nGrammar, Johnson's Dictionary, Scott's Lessons, English Reader,\r\nAmerican Selections, American Reader, Columbian Orator, Daball's and\r\nDilworth's Arithmetic. Later on a new and inexperienced board of\r\ncommissioners enumerates the above list with one exception, and\r\nconcludes with the information, \"all of which are American\r\nselections.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of common schools in 1819 rearranged the boundaries\r\nof the school districts of the town, and recorded these boundaries\r\nsomewhat definitely. The number at that time was thirteen, but since\r\nthat date the number has been changed many times and their boundaries\r\nhave frequently been altered.\r\n\r\nOf the schools of the former town of Monroe four have become union\r\nschools, having high school departments, viz: Central Valley, in\r\nFebruary, 1895; Monroe, in December, 1896; Turner, in May, 1902, and\r\nTuxedo, in December, 1902.\r\n\r\nDistrict No. 1 is the district that includes the village of Monroe.\r\nThough it contains practically the territory of District No. 1, as\r\nrecorded in 1819, its boundaries have been materially changed. The\r\nRev. D. N. Freeland says, in his history of the town of Monroe, that\r\nthe first mention of a school in this neighborhood is of one held in\r\nthe Presbyterian church building at Seamanville. After that a log\r\nschool-house was built just west of the church. The old stone\r\nschool-house on the road to Mombasha followed, and this in turn gave\r\nway to another built a few rods further south. In 1857 a two-story\r\nbuilding near the Presbyterian church was constructed and this was\r\nmade to answer the purpose until 1884, when the building now in use\r\n(1907) was erected at a cost of $10,000. This building has now become\r\ntoo small and the people of the district have purchased, during the\r\npast year, a new site just north of the Episcopal chapel, containing\r\nnearly seven acres, at a cost of $5,000. They have also appropriated\r\nthe sum of $40,000 for the erection of a suitable building, the\r\nfoundations of which are at this time completed.\r\n\r\nOf the persons serving the district in an official relation the\r\nfollowing have rendered the longest continuous service; Henry Mapes,\r\nas clerk, thirty-four years; George R. Conklin, trustee, twenty\r\nyears; A. B. Hulse, trustee, fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe school of District No. 1 was admitted as a member of the\r\nUniversity of the State of New York December 17, 1896, having been\r\ncreated a union school the preceding year. The following are the\r\nnames of the trustees appearing upon the certificate of admission as\r\npetitioners: Eugene McGarrah, George R. Conklin, L. H. Marvin,\r\nSolomon Fairchild.\r\n\r\nThe present board of education is: Fletcher B. Brooks, Solomon\r\nFairchild, Millard Mapes, Frank F. Griffin, and Clarence S. Knight.\r\nIn addition to the usual work of a board of education, this board has\r\nthe additional responsibility of building a modern school-house.\r\n\r\nTURNER VILLAGE.\r\n\r\nMany changes have to be recorded in the thriving village of Turner,\r\nin the eastern part of the town of Monroe. By common consent the name\r\nhas been changed from \"Turners\" to \"Turner,\" and this seems to be a\r\nmost reasonable change.\r\n\r\nNo longer do the trains of the Erie Railroad Company sweep\r\nmajestically into the depot, there to stand impatiently while its\r\nhungry passengers regale themselves in that famous restaurant founded\r\nby Peter Turner. The now common, every-day dining-car attached to\r\nnearly every train, has crowded out that famous business. The large\r\nbrick building was destroyed by fire and the restaurant moved to the\r\nwooden building on the opposite side of the track. This property is\r\nnow owned by the Ramapo Mountain Realty Company, but is fast falling\r\ninto decay. One end alone is used as a depot. Below the hill stands\r\nthe famous grist mill which receives its power from the village pond\r\nnear by. Across the street from the mill stands the old hotel of\r\nstage coach days, now renovated into a modern hotel, known as\r\n\"Silver Fox Inn.\" This property and the farm connected therewith are\r\nowned by the Ramapo Mountain Realty Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geo. R. Conklin]\r\n\r\nThe old smithy, where Cortland Rumsey's hammer caused the anvil to\r\nring, has long since become a business house. The village blacksmith,\r\nJ. B. Hallock, has built a modern shop near by and causes the same\r\nold anvils to ring as hearty and strong as ever.\r\n\r\nThe little old stone school-house where our fathers learned their\r\n\"three R's,\" is now a dwelling and a magnificent school-house stands\r\non a hill overlooking the entire village. There, four learned\r\ninstructors hold forth, where a few short years ago one was\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nThe few rambling houses that constituted the little village of a few\r\nyears ago have given way to modern dwellings and business places,\r\nconstituting a thriving village of some eight hundred people, all\r\nbusy and prosperous.\r\n\r\nSurrounding the village on every hillside stand the beautiful summer\r\nhomes of some wealthy New Yorkers. Among these are the homes of W. R.\r\nBarr, \"Stony Wolde\"; Mrs. John Brower, \"Blythlea\"; and the homes of\r\nE. H. Harriman, Ward Brower, Farrand Brower, Max Jagerhuber, Orrin\r\nS. Wood and William L. Strout. Where once our farmers tilled the soil\r\nbeautiful lawns appear. To the east, where once hunters and trappers\r\nalone journeyed, on the highest peak of the Ramapo Mountains, rises\r\nthe mansion of E. H. Harriman. Inch by inch and foot by foot this\r\ngreat stone structure rises into view above the trees that surround\r\nit. A railway has been hewn out of the side of the mountain and a\r\ncable railroad operates cars that hoist workmen and materials to the\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nThe village maintains two churches--a Methodist Episcopal and a\r\nCatholic. Both have excellent sanctuaries and congregations of\r\nearnest, sincere, right-living people. They have done yeoman work in\r\ntheir territory and their influence has been widespread. Connected\r\nwith the Methodist Church is a Sunday school and Epworth league.\r\n\r\nThe famous old store of Thomas Earl has been torn down and the\r\nvillage now has five stores. The old \"Bombeetel\" house still stands\r\nat the cross-roads in the center of the village and now contains the\r\nvillage market run by J. R. Brooks.\r\n\r\nTime has indeed dealt kindly with Turner. The latest item to be\r\naccredited her is electricity. Nightly the village streets are\r\nbrilliantly lighted and business goes on as busily as by daylight.\r\nThe magic current is introduced to the houses and brings light and\r\ncheerfulness to the homes.\r\n\r\nThe old village of Centerville would scarcely recognize the village\r\nof Turner, which is but the village of Centerville under a new name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: David A. Morrison.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\nBy David A. Morrison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis important town is in the northern part of Orange County,\r\nbordering upon Ulster. It lies between the towns of Newburgh on the\r\neast, and Crawford on the west. Each of these towns has a large\r\ntongue of land that extends much further toward the north than the\r\nterritory of Montgomery, the northern bounds of which form nearly a\r\nstraight line. On the south are the towns of New Windsor,\r\nHamptonburgh and Wallkill, from which it is separated by rather\r\nirregular rectangular lines. The area of the town as shown by the\r\nlast Supervisors' report, is 30,578 acres. The assessed valuation of\r\nproperty taxable in the town and found by the Assessors in 1906\r\naggregated $2,094,640. The total taxes for that year amounted to\r\n$23,953.01.\r\n\r\nTITLES.\r\n\r\nThe territory of Montgomery is a part of the original John Evans\r\nPatent, which seems to have been set aside subsequently for various\r\nreasons. In 1714 it was in the precinct of Shawangunk, in Ulster\r\nCounty, where it remained until 1743. when it became part of the\r\nWallkill precinct. At that time it embraced the following patents:\r\n\r\n Cadwallader Colden, April 9, 1719                   2,000 acres\r\n John Johnson, Jr., February 3, 1720                 1,000   \"\r\n Thomas Brazier, March 17, 1720                      2,000   \"\r\n Henry Wileman, June 30, 1712                        3,000   \"\r\n David Gallatian, June 4, 1719                       1,000   \"\r\n Edward Gatehouse, January, 1719                     1,000   \"\r\n James Alexander, April 9, 1719                      2,000   \"\r\n Archibald Kennedy, April 9, 1719                    2,000   \"\r\n James Smith, December 15, 1722                      2,000   \"\r\n Patrick McKnight, April 9, 1719                     2,000   \"\r\n Thomas Noxon, May 28, 1720                          2,000   \"\r\n Francis Harrison & Co., July 7, 1720                5,000   \"\r\n Jeremiah Schuyler & Co., January 22, 1719          10,000   \"\r\n Phillip Schuyler and others, July 20, 1720          8,000   \"\r\n Jacobus Bruyn and Henry Wileman, April 25, 1722     2,500   \"\r\n Frederick Morris and Samuel Heath, January 24, 1736.\r\n Thomas Ellison and Lawrence Roome, Nov. 12, 1750\r\n Cadwallader Colden, Jr. and David Colden, June 20, 1761--720 A.\r\n\r\nIn 1772 Wallkill Precinct was divided and the eastern part named the\r\nprecinct of Hanover. In 1782 this name was changed to the precinct\r\nof Montgomery, which was erected as the town of Montgomery in 1788.\r\nTen years afterwards it was, with other towns, taken from Ulster\r\nCounty and annexed to Orange County. In 1823 the town of Montgomery\r\nwas divided and the western part containing about 25,000 acres\r\nconstituted and named the town of Crawford. In 1830 the southern\r\npart of Montgomery was detached to form (in part) the town of\r\nHamptonburgh. The last alteration in its boundaries was made in 1842,\r\nwhen four farms containing nearly 600 acres were taken from the town\r\nof New Windsor and annexed to Montgomery.\r\n\r\nNATURAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe fertile valley of the Wallkill, which extends through the town on\r\na northeasterly course, dividing it nearly into equal parts, is a\r\ndistinguishing characteristic. For nearly a third of the way, where\r\nthe stream enters Ulster County, it flows very nearly north in a\r\nstraight line. Then it deflects toward the southwest to the village\r\nof Montgomery, when there is a sharp bend, which afterward turns\r\nnearly at right angles toward the east and finally leaves the town in\r\nnearly a straight course again, forming a part of the eastern\r\nboundary of the town and dividing it from Hamptonburgh. The most\r\nimportant tributary of the Wallkill is the Tinn Brook, which begins\r\nin the town of New Windsor, pursues a sinuous career, and finally\r\ntumbles into the Wallkill near the village of Walden. The Beaver Dam\r\nstream rises in the southeastern part of the town and flows nearly\r\nsouth into the Otterkill, in the town of Hamptonburgh. The source of\r\nthis stream is a large spring of great depth. McKnight's Kill also\r\nrises in the southeasterly part of the town, and flows southerly into\r\nthe Otterkill near Burnside. The Muddy Kill rises in the western\r\npart of the town, drains that section in a sluggish way, and ends\r\nnear the village of Montgomery. The surface of the town is\r\ndiversified with hills, rolling and meadow land. Comfort's Hills on\r\nthe west rise from 600 to 800 feet above tide and are much the\r\nhighest elevation. For adaptation to varied agriculture the town is\r\nnot excelled by any other town in the county. The uplands are warm,\r\nfertile, and comparatively easy to cultivate. The meadows generally\r\nproduce large crops of grass, and afford excellent pasturage.\r\nNumerous springs and small streams furnish an abundant supply of pure\r\nwater. Dairying is the predominant agricultural industry.\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENTS.\r\n\r\nOn the east bank of the Wallkill, on the old Rogers farm, there was\r\nan old Indian settlement. The red men had made a goodly clearing in\r\nthe forest here and, tradition says, had planted fruit trees, and\r\nwhen the white man first set foot in this region he found full-grown\r\nbearing apple trees on this ancient clearing. An Indian settlement\r\nwas found on the flat above the bridge over the Wallkill, near the\r\nold Miller stone house. Another had its wigwams on the old\r\nChristoffel (or Stuffell) Moul (Mould) farm about two miles north of\r\nMontgomery on the main highway afterwards known as the stage road\r\nfrom Goshen to Albany. These left for more remote regions in 1775.\r\n\r\nNear the present village of Walden the settlement of Henry Wileman\r\nwas made. His patent contained 3,000 acres, and he settled upon it\r\nvery soon after its purchase in 1712. What was known as the Harrison\r\nPatent was granted May 25, 1721. This was given to the following\r\npersons: Francis Harrison, Allan Jarrat, Adolphus Phillips, George\r\nClarke, Johanes Lansing, Henry Wileman, Jacobus Bruyn and William\r\nSharpas. This entire tract was surveyed and a large village laid out,\r\nand deeds were given to all actual settlers. Among these the\r\nfollowing were named: Hans Newkirk, Hendrick Newkirk, Matthias\r\nSlimmer, Peter Kysler, ____ Kraus, ____ Brandos. These ancient\r\nsettlers upon this land were Palatines, and after a few years they\r\nerected a small log church within the village, the site of which is\r\nstill fairly indicated by the old graveyard on the east side of the\r\nGoshen road, a short distance south of Montgomery. This old village\r\nwas known as Germantown.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile farther south on this patent Johannes Miller, a German,\r\nmade a settlement in 1727. The next year he built a stone house where\r\nMr. Elmer Miller afterwards lived. His grandson, Johannes Miller, was\r\na leading citizen of the town in later years--a progressive man,\r\nprominent in promoting several important public enterprises, and\r\nespecially active in the construction of the Newburgh and Cochecton\r\nTurnpike Road. His services towards establishing and maintaining the\r\nMontgomery Academy have always been held in grateful remembrance.\r\n\r\nThe 5,000-acre tract granted to Schuyler & Co., was first settled by\r\nJeronimous Weller & Co., in 1721. Another grant of 10,000 acres was\r\nsettled by a company consisting of Johannes Mingus, his son\r\nJeronimous, Mattias Miltzbagh, and others whose names are not\r\ndefinitely known. It was agreed by this company that a tract of 100\r\nacres would be granted to each family that would locate permanently\r\nupon it. Mingus built a mill, around which the old village of Ward's\r\nBridge soon clustered. But Mingus lost his life in this mill by\r\naccident soon afterward, which resulted in considerable dispute over\r\nthe property.\r\n\r\nThe Wallkill or Goodwill settlement is supposed to date from 1724-25.\r\nJohn Mackneel and Adam Graham were among the first settlers. When\r\nthey came into the Precinct is not definitely known. The former owned\r\na part of what is now known as the Downs farm; the latter settled on\r\nwhat is now the Parsonage farm. In 1727 Archibald, James and Robert\r\nHunter purchased 200 acres of land, on which a house had then been\r\nbuilt, from James Alexander, the patentee; this purchase included the\r\nHenry Suydam farm. In 1731 James Munnel settled on, or near, the\r\nCharles Miller farm, now owned by Mr. William Y. Dennison. Alexander\r\nKidd settled on what is still known as the Kidd Homestead, about\r\n2-1/2 miles north of the Church in 1736. Benjamin Haines came into\r\nthe neighborhood in 1739, and the Rev. Joseph Houston was installed\r\npastor of the Goodwill Church in 1740. Other early settlers were\r\nJames Barkley, on the James W. Bowne farm; the Rev. Joseph Moffat,\r\n1758; John Blake who bought 475 acres of land in 1761, part of which\r\nis owned and occupied by his great grandson, Mr. John P. M. Blake,\r\nand whose son, John Blake, Jr., was in after years, a prominent man,\r\nbeing supervisor sixteen years, and a member of assembly several\r\nterms, sheriff and congressman; Samuel Miller, who came from Canada\r\nprevious to 1764; Peter Hill in 1767; Captain Hendrichs Van Keuren\r\nin 1768; Colonel John Nicholson; John Morrison; Gideon Pelton, and\r\nTunis Van Arsdale, whose blacksmith shop is mentioned in the early\r\nrecords of the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert Young.]\r\n\r\nAdjoining the Goodwill settlement on the east, Cadwallader Colden had\r\nbeen granted a patent for 2,000 acres and was settled in 1728 where\r\nMr. George W. Pimm now resides. The locality was named Coldenham in\r\nhis honor. He was one of the most prominent of the early settlers,\r\nbeing surveyor-general of the Province, lieutenant-governor and\r\nseveral limes acting governor. As a man he was esteemed for his\r\ngreat learning, benevolence and strict honesty. As a public officer\r\nhe was distinguished for his unblemished integrity. Several buildings\r\nwere erected in that vicinity by members of the Colden family, some\r\nof which are still standing.\r\n\r\nThe Neelytown section adjoins the Goodwill neighborhood on the south,\r\nand was so called from a large and influential family which appears\r\nto have been active in bringing in the early settlers, but whose name\r\nhas entirely disappeared from the community, it was settled before\r\n1726. In that year the names of John Neely and Thomas Neely appear as\r\nactual settlers. At that time Charles Booth who purchased 1,000 acres\r\nof land had built his first house near where Mr. William Conning\r\nlived in later years--his two sons, Charles and George Booth, were\r\nwith him. A defective list of freeholders made in 1728 contains the\r\nname of Alexander Neely. William and Robert Neely were witnesses to a\r\nwill in 1731, and the name of John Neely, Jr., is seen in an old\r\nrecord. William Eager with his sons, William and Thomas, came to\r\nNeelytown in 1741. He built a log house where the residence of Mr.\r\nSamuel W. Eager now stands. His second house was of stone and was\r\nsituated a short distance south of the first and built before the\r\nRevolution. His descendants are very numerous and are widely\r\nscattered. Samuel W. Eager, Orange County's first historian, was one\r\nof them. Other early settlers in this section were James McCobb, who\r\nlocated at a very early date on the Sherwood farm, now \"Nestledown\";\r\nWilliam Jackson, James Jackson, James Houston, William Young, Captain\r\nAlexander Trimble, 1764; Patrick Barber, 1764; Captain James McBride\r\nand Rev. Robert Annan, 1765.\r\n\r\nA settlement across the Wallkill opposite the present village of\r\nMontgomery, was made by Henry Crist, Stevanus Crist, Mathias\r\nMillspaugh and others. This land was then considered the best in the\r\ntown. These Germans were a vigorous and hearty people, and they went\r\nto work boldly to cultivate the land and establish comfortable homes,\r\nwith a determination to succeed. They soon began to extend their\r\nfarms to the Comfort Hills slopes, and into the section now embraced\r\nin the town of Crawford. Their success attracted many representatives\r\nof the sturdy Scotch-Irish race, who joined them soon afterward.\r\nAmong the more progressive pioneer settlers was Henry Crist, from\r\nwhom descended many active men and women who became leading and\r\ninfluential citizens of the town. Jacob Crist is said to have been\r\ndrowned in the Hudson River on his return from New Amsterdam with his\r\nwedding outfit. Henry Crist, the early immigrant, built near the foot\r\nof the hill east of the old Dutch church. His son, Jacob, planted his\r\nhome on the hill opposite Montgomery village near the mill.\r\n\r\nAmong other early settlers were David Bookstaver, Jacob Bookstaver,\r\nFrederick Sinsabaugh, and Johannes Youngblood who bought an 800 acre\r\ntract. It is recorded of these pioneer German settlers that they were\r\neven unable to build so much as a log cabin at first, and were\r\nobliged to make excavations in the hillside in which to pass the\r\nwinter. This they did in the gravelly hill east of the old Brick\r\nchurch. In these primitive dugouts they waited patiently for the\r\nsnowdrifts to melt away in the springtime, when they might renew\r\ntheir labors and provide more comfortable shelter for their families.\r\n\r\nJohannes Miller came to America in 1700, lived in Ulster County for\r\na time, and about 1727 settled upon a portion of the Harrison patent.\r\nFrederick Shafer, a tanner by trade, was also among these old\r\nsettlers, and soon established a tannery, which was afterward\r\nimproved by his son Daniel.\r\n\r\nCharles Booth purchased 1,000 acres of land in Neelytown, and this\r\ntract remained in the Booth family for a long series of years\r\nafterward. This family came into the town from Long Island, and\r\nGeorge Booth became a leading citizen and was so regarded all through\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nMILITARY NOTES.\r\n\r\nIn 1738 a company of militia of the Wallkill was organized under\r\nCaptain John Byard, and formed part of a regiment of which A.\r\nGaasbeck Chambers was Colonel and Wessel Ten Broeck Lieutenant-Colonel,\r\nto protect the early settlers against the incursions of the Indians.\r\nAmong those whose names were enrolled in this company the following are\r\nknown to have been residents of what is now the town of Montgomery:\r\nJohn Newkirk, sergeant; James Gillespie, Thomas Gillespie, Alexander\r\nMilligan, Alexander Kidd, Archibald Hunter, James Hunter, John Mingus,\r\nStephanus Crist, James Munell, John Munell, George Munell, John McNeill,\r\nJohn McNeill, Jr., Robert Hunter, Richard Gatehouse, Joseph Sutter,\r\nPhilip Milsbaugh, Cronimus Mingus, Stoffel Moul, Johannes Crans,\r\nMatthias Meltzbagh, Hendrix Newkirk, Hendrick Crist, Benjamin Hains,\r\nJohn Neely, Jr., Frederick Sanzabah.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 the regiment was divided into two regiments. The first\r\nembraced Kingston and the northern part of the county; the second\r\nembraced the Precincts of Highlands, Wallkill and Shawangunk, and in\r\nthis form took part in the French and Indian War. The roster of\r\nofficers in the second regiment included the names of the following\r\npersons who then resided in what is now the town of Montgomery: Jacob\r\nNewkirk, Captain; Cadwallader C. Colden, Captain; David Gallatin,\r\nCaptain; Matthew Rea, Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe militia of the Revolution was organized by an act of the\r\nProvincial Convention passed August 22, 1775. Ulster County was\r\ndivided into four regimental districts. The second district comprised\r\nthe precincts of New Windsor, Hanover and Wallkill. At first there\r\nwere twelve companies in the regiment, of which Hanover furnished\r\nfive, commanded by Captain Matthew Felter, William Jackson,\r\nJames Milliken, John J. Graham and John Gillespie. In 1777 the\r\nnumber of companies was reduced to nine, four of which were in\r\nHanover, under Captains Felter, Milliken, Hendrik Van Keuren and\r\nJames McBride.\r\n\r\nAn eminent historian said of the second regiment of Ulster County\r\nmilitia that \"it gave, perhaps, more fighting men than were drawn\r\nfrom other similar organizations,\" and that \"no other regiment of\r\nmilitia was more active from the beginning until the end of the war.\"\r\nThere was fight in it from start to finish. \"As a rule circumstances\r\nwould not admit of the calling out of an entire company from its beat\r\nat one time; some must remain at home; but portions of this regiment\r\nwere in almost constant motion, some going, others returning.\" From\r\nDecember, 1876, to April 12, 1778, less than 16 months, the militia\r\nof Hanover and adjoining precincts were called out twelve times and\r\nspent 202 days in the field.\r\n\r\nAlthough the records of churches and traditions give glimpses of\r\ncontroversies, the inhabitants of Hanover precinct acted with great\r\nunanimity and showed an intense patriotic spirit during the War for\r\nIndependence. The pledge of association, dated May 8, 1775, in which\r\nthey pledged their \"support to the Continental Congress in resisting\r\nthe oppressive acts of the British Parliament,\" and in the most\r\nsolemn manner resolved \"never to become slaves,\" was signed first by\r\nDr. Charles Clinton and received 342 signatures.\r\n\r\nThe history of the men of Montgomery in the Revolution, who they\r\nwere, and what they did, if it could be written, would be a story of\r\ntoils, privation and exposure of great interest to the present\r\ngeneration. In few sections of the State did the burden of the war\r\nbear more heavily than in the valleys of the Wallkill and the Hudson,\r\nand in no portion was it borne with more unflinching determination.\r\nBut this history cannot be written. The names of many of these men\r\nand their deeds have sunk into oblivion. A few of those preserved by\r\nhistory and tradition, together with the places where they lived, are\r\nmentioned. To locate the places definitely the names of the owners at\r\nthe present (1908), are given.\r\n\r\nArthur Parks lived at Ward's Bridge (now Montgomery), on what was\r\nafterwards known as the L'Hommedieu farm, now occupied by Mr. H. H.\r\nHallett. He was a member of the Committee of Safety in 1775 and 1776,\r\nfirst Lieutenant in Captain William Jackson's company of militia,\r\nMajor of a battalion of minute men in 1776, member of the first\r\nProvincial Convention, member of the convention that framed our first\r\nState Constitution and of the convention that amended it, and State\r\nSenator for eleven years.\r\n\r\nJacob Newkirk was captain under Colonel Thomas Ellison in the French\r\nand Indian War, member of the Committee of Safety, Major, and\r\nafterwards Lieutenant-Colonel of the second regiment Ulster County\r\nmilitia, and commanded the regiment during the years that Colonel\r\nJames McClaughry was a prisoner and was recovering from his wounds\r\nreceived at the capture of Fort Montgomery.\r\n\r\nHenry Smith was also a member of the Committee of Safety for the\r\nprecinct and was first Lieutenant in Captain Matthew Felter's\r\ncompany; he lived nearly two miles north of Montgomery on the farm\r\nnow owned and occupied by his descendant, Mr. James Smith.\r\n\r\nHugh Lindsay was a private in Colonel John Lamb's Artillery, and was\r\ntaken prisoner at the capture of Fort Montgomery; he lived at Ward's\r\nBridge and afterwards built and lived in the house on Bridge street\r\nnow owned by the estate of the late Jonathan M. Morrison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. T. Lodge.]\r\n\r\nAlexander Trimble was quarter-master of the Second Ulster Regiment in\r\nthe War of the Revolution, and also a member of the Committee of\r\nSafety; he lived about two miles south of Goodwill Church on the farm\r\nnow owned and occupied by Mr. George Van Alst.\r\n\r\nJohannes Moul (Mould), who lived about two miles north of Montgomery,\r\nwhere his great-great-grandson, Mr. John D. Mould, now lives, was a\r\nsergeant in the French and Indian War, and with his son, Johannes\r\nMoul, Jr., and his brother, Christopher Moul, were privates in\r\nColonel McClaughry's Regiment in the Revolution. These three patriots\r\nalso evinced their patriotism by loaning money to the Government when\r\nit was urgently needed to equip the army for the capture of\r\nCornwallis.\r\n\r\nJames Milliken, a member of the Committee of Safety, lived on the\r\neast side of the Wallkill, where Mr. Harvey N. Smith now resides, was\r\ncaptain of one of the Hanover companies, and was killed at Fort\r\nMontgomery.\r\n\r\nHendricus Van Keuren was a veteran of the French and Indian War, who\r\nserved throughout the Revolution as Captain, and according to family\r\ntradition, gratuitously lived on what is known as the Downs farm,\r\nbetween Montgomery and Goodwill church.\r\n\r\nJohn Nicholson was Colonel of the Third N. Y. Regiment of the\r\nContinental Line, which was brigaded under General Richard\r\nMontgomery, and took part in the assault on Quebec when the brave\r\nMontgomery was killed. The privations and exposures of that\r\ncampaign were so great that with impaired health he returned to his\r\nfarm, near Maybrook, which is now divided, and owned by Mr. John\r\nWiley and Mr. William H. Jewell.\r\n\r\nHamilton Morrison enlisted as soon as he was old enough, and served\r\nfirst as a private and then as a sergeant in Captain James McBride's\r\ncompany, Second Ulster County Militia. He lived about a mile south of\r\nGoodwill Church on what is known as the Morrison Homestead, now owned\r\nand occupied by his grandsons, Mr. George H. Morrison and Mr. John\r\nG. Morrison.\r\n\r\nTunis Van Arsdale lived on the adjoining farm (now a part of the\r\nhomestead), and was a blacksmith. His shop was the rendezvous of the\r\npatriots in that vicinity. He was also a private in Captain Van\r\nKeuren's company and saved his life at Fort Montgomery by slipping\r\nbetween the legs of a British soldier who was holding an American\r\nbayoneted against the wall of the fort, and escaped in the darkness.\r\n\r\nJohn Van Arsdale, who lived with his elder brother, Tunis, enlisted\r\nin the Continental Army at the beginning of the war, and served\r\nfaithfully until its close. He suffered intensely from cold and\r\nhardship in the Canada expedition, was severely wounded and taken\r\nprisoner at Fort Montgomery, languished many weary months in the\r\n\"old sugar house\" and in the foul hold of the \"Jersey prison ship,\"\r\nwas finally exchanged, and then braved the perils of Indian warfare\r\nin several campaigns. On November 25, 1783, he witnessed the\r\nevacuation of New York City by the British, which was the final\r\ntriumph of the cause for which he and others had fought and suffered\r\nseven long years, and was present when the advancing Americans,\r\nfollowing closely upon the retiring British, reached the Battery to\r\nperform the last formality in repossessing the city, which was to\r\nunfurl the American flag over Fort George, but found the royal\r\nensign still floating as usual over the Fort. The British had nailed\r\ntheir colors to the staff and taken away the halyards. In this\r\ndilemma John Van Arsdale ascended the flag-staff, partly by ladder,\r\nbut mainly by shinning, tore down the British flag and rove the new\r\nhalyards by which the Star Spangled Banner was quickly run up while\r\nthe assembled thousands cheered, and the artillery boomed forth a\r\nnational salute. While other localities may boast of those who\r\nstruck the first blow for American freedom, Montgomery may justly\r\nclaim for one of her sons the glory of removing the last vestige of\r\nBritish authority from this country.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE TOWN.\r\n\r\nThe town was originally organized under the name of Hanover Precinct\r\nin 1772. The present territory of Crawford was then included, the\r\nwhole having been taken from the old Wallkill Precinct. In 1782 the\r\nname was changed to Montgomery Precinct, and seven years later it was\r\nfinally changed to the town of Montgomery. This title was bestowed in\r\nhonor of General Montgomery, who was killed in the assault upon\r\nQuebec in 1775. Major Colden was the supervisor of the old Wallkill\r\nprecinct in 1768-69.\r\n\r\nThe record of the first town meeting, now on file in the town clerk's\r\noffice, is of April 5, 1803. Reuben Neely was then chosen supervisor,\r\nand Arthur Parks, town clerk. There were fifty-five overseers of\r\nhighways in the town that year. But the laborers were few, the system\r\nof road-working was sadly defective, as in fact it remained for\r\nnearly a hundred years afterwards, and the results were primitive and\r\nunsatisfactory, although, of course, far less was required of a\r\npublic road in those days than is now demanded, and the people\r\naccepted the situation without complaint, so far as the record shows.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of supervisors of the town to 1908: David\r\nGalatian, 1798; John Blake, 1799; Reuben Neely, 1800 to 1810; John\r\nBlake, Jr., to 1826; Samuel W. Eager, to 1833; Nathaniel P. Hill,\r\n1834; Edward Blake, to 1839; James Galatian, to 1841; William Blake,\r\nto 1844; William Graham, to 1846; Stephen Rapalje, 1847; Joshua G.\r\nHallock, to 1849; Lindley M. Ferris, 1850; Johannes M. Hunter, to\r\n1852; Stephen Rapalje, to 1863; Marcus K. Hill, 1864; Stephen\r\nRapalje, to 1873; Daniel M. Wade, to 1875; Marcus K. Hill, to 1877;\r\nCharles J. Van Alst, to 1879; Robert Young, to 1886; Andrew K. Wade,\r\nto 1889; Robert Young, 1890; Irving H. Loughran, to 1900; William H.\r\nDidsburg, to 1905; Hector W. Millspaugh, to 1907; William G. Decker,\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nVILLAGES.\r\n\r\nThe old village of Montgomery is on the bank of the Wallkill in the\r\nsouthern part of the town. It was here that Henry Crist, Stephen\r\nCrist and Matthias Millspaugh settled at an early date, on the west\r\nbank of the river. Johannes Mingus built a grist-mill there, which\r\nwas afterwards sold to James Ward with 200 acres of land, upon which\r\nthe village was built. Mr. Ward built a rude bridge across the\r\nWallkill in order that his customers might reach his mill. This was\r\nreally the first road bridge of any kind known in that vicinity for\r\nyears afterward. In fact, the place took its name from this important\r\nstructure, as well as the post-office itself, it being known as\r\nWard's Bridge for many years.\r\n\r\nJames Clinton and William Crist, having obtained an interest in the\r\nKennedy patent, upon which the village stands, laid out \"a small town\r\ncalled Montgomery town,\" which gave the village that name. Among\r\nother early settlers there were John McFaugh, David Crist, John\r\nMcKinstry, Matthew Hunter, Samuel Smith, Arthur Parks and Oolis\r\nShulp. James Ward, the pioneer, lived in a log cabin.\r\n\r\nThe village was incorporated by a special act dated February 17,\r\n1810. Hugh Lindsey was the first president. The first village tax\r\naggregated $60. Two years later $100 was raised to build a market\r\nhouse, and in 1814, $200 was appropriated for a fire engine. But it\r\nwas not until seven years later that four professional firemen were\r\nappointed. In 1880 this village tax had increased to over $1,200.\r\n\r\nThe location of Montgomery on a placid stretch of the Wallkill, with\r\nits slightly elevated banks, affording a fine natural drainage, is\r\npeculiarly healthful, and there are many attractive and commodious\r\nprivate residences. Among the leading manufacturing industries is the\r\nworsted mills of William Crabtree & Sons. The people of Montgomery\r\nare noted for their hospitality and public spirit. The place is\r\nsurrounded by fine State roads, and ranks as one of the important\r\nhistoric villages of Orange County.\r\n\r\nWalden is the most thriving and important village. It is on the\r\nWallkill River at the high falls, by which indefinite name it was\r\nknown for years. The settlement began many years before the\r\nRevolution. Of course, the first structure was the inevitable\r\ngrist-mill, as in nearly every instance in this region. James Kidd\r\nbuilt a mill at the foot of the falls on the east side of the stream,\r\nthough the precise date is not definitely known. In any event, the\r\nrecords show that in 1768 this old mill had already fallen into the\r\npossession of Johannes Decker. In 1789 it belonged to Cadwallader\r\nColden, Jr. The plant was afterward converted into a cotton factory.\r\n\r\nMr. Walden, the founder of this village, is said to have struggled\r\nmanfully under adverse influences and suffered defeat at the end in\r\nhis old age, causing him to retire ultimately from the scene of his\r\nlabors. Leaving the refinements of city life to establish\r\nmanufacturing interests in this sparsely settled region, and without\r\nadequate protection, he spent his fortune and his active energies\r\nhere practically without reward. There being no railways, raw\r\nmaterial had to be drawn in sleighs in winter to these factories.\r\n\r\nMr. Walden was a prosperous New York merchant. While summering in the\r\nHighlands, he extended his drive with Mrs. Walden many miles further,\r\nand came upon this charming valley of the Wallkill, through which a\r\nbroad stream flowed. They saw the old mill at the very foot of the\r\ncataract, and a tiny cottage in a grove of locusts further down the\r\nstream. The old merchant perceived the wonderful possibilities of\r\nthis picturesque spot, and he lost no time in developing the place.\r\nHe purchased large tracts of land covering the region, closed up his\r\nextensive city business and moved here. The place grew very slowly in\r\nthe earlier years, even after its incorporation in 1855. Down to 1868\r\nthe population of the village did not exceed 600 souls. Of course,\r\nthe manufacturing interests had not been fully developed at that\r\ntime. The people were still largely employed in trades and farm work.\r\nThe New York Knife Company began business in 1856 by purchasing the\r\ncloth mills of Scofield, Capron & Gowdy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edward Whitehead.]\r\n\r\nThere are two fine iron bridges over the Wallkill at this point, many\r\nhandsome private residences on the heights on either side of the\r\nriver, several busy factories, churches, schools, newspapers,\r\nnumerous stores and shops of every kind, and there is a general\r\naspect of thrill and progress all through the pretty village. Most of\r\nthis growth is modern; nearly all the more substantial structures are\r\nless than forty years old. The act of incorporation was passed April\r\n9, 1855, and the first village meeting was held the following week.\r\nAugustus F. Scofield was the first president, and continued six\r\nyears. Previous to the incorporation of the village the fire company\r\nhad been in existence some time. This organization was known as \"The\r\nWalden Fire Incorporation,\" and it constituted the Fire Department of\r\nthe village for years afterwards. In 1865 Daniel Torbush was the\r\nchief engineer, and in 1880, when the company was known as\r\n\"Enterprise No. 1,\" the chief engineer was Granville Crist.\r\n\r\nA new comer in Walden in 1859 says there were then only three\r\nprominent business houses, those of Marcus K. Hill, Ebenezer Knapp,\r\nand Joseph Millspaugh. It seemed to him then that about nine-tenths\r\nof the inhabitants there were named either Millspaugh or Kidd.\r\nAugustus F. Scofield was then the leading citizen of wealth and\r\ninfluence, having a large shawl factory. The hotels were the Eagle\r\nand the St. Nicholas, as they are at present. Scofield Hall was used\r\nfor public assemblies and such eminent lecturers as John G. Saxe,\r\nRev. Edward K. Beecher, Park Benjamin and Fanny Fern appeared there.\r\nThe much loved village parson was old \"Dominie\" Schoonmaker, who\r\nlabored there faithfully for many years. The industries of Walden\r\nwere then confined to the shawl factory, the satinette factory of\r\nGiles Andrews, and the knife factory. James Todd was widely known as\r\n\"the model farmer of Orange County.\" George Weller was a prominent\r\nresident greatly devoted to all the village interests, and his home\r\nwas regarded as a scene of unbounded hospitality and good cheer.\r\n\r\nThe first introduction of gas in Walden many years ago was not a\r\nfinancial success, and the company abandoned the project. A public\r\nwater system was introduced in 1892. Previous to that time water for\r\nfires had to be taken through long hose from the Wallkill and Tinn\r\nBrook streams. The electric fire alarm system was installed about\r\nfifteen years ago. The newspaper known as the _Walden Herald_ was\r\nestablished about 1869, and the _Walden Citizen_ is in its twentieth\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nNear the line of Newburgh, in the northeastern part of the town, is\r\nthe old hamlet of St. Andrews, which was left behind in the later\r\ndevelopment of Walden with its great water-power facilities. It was\r\nnamed for the ancient Episcopal church there, which is now located at\r\nWalden.\r\n\r\nMaybrook is an important railway junction, in the extreme southeast\r\ncorner of the town. The population, which numbers about four hundred,\r\nis composed principally of railroad employees.\r\n\r\nColdenham is near the New Windsor boundary, but in the southeastern\r\npart of the town. The title came from the Colden family and the\r\nhamlet was the home of the Lieutenant Governor and acting Chief\r\nMagistrate of the New York Colony.\r\n\r\nAllard's Corners on the northwest border, and Scott's Corners, east\r\nof Montgomery village, are other small hamlets of minor importance.\r\n\r\nBANKS.\r\n\r\nLe Fevre and De Garmo were the first bankers, beginning business in\r\nWalden in 1870. They continued but a short time, and in 1873 the\r\nExchange Bank was organized with George W. Stoddard in active charge.\r\nThis was merged into the Walden National Bank in 1877 and was\r\nsucceeded in 1897 by the National Bank of Walden, the name of the\r\npresent institution. The Walden Savings Bank, the oldest and largest\r\nfinancial institution in the town, began business June 1, 1872, with\r\nthe following officers: Seth M. Capron, president; Thomas W. Bradley,\r\nvice-president; and Peter LeFevre, secretary and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe Montgomery National Bank began business November 1, 1905, with\r\nthe following officers: William H. Senior, president; John A.\r\nCrabtree, vice-president; E. I. Emerson, cashier. Directors: William\r\nEager, John J. Vanderoef, John A. Crabtree, Clunks D. Wait, J.\r\nHarvey Harris, Dr. E. Ross Elliott, William F. Lodge, Harvey Tuttle,\r\nWilliam H. Senior, Walter R. Comfort, Fred W. Tower.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nNearly all the soil of this town is well adapted to successful\r\nagriculture in its varied forms. While much of the land has been\r\ndevoted to meadows and grass, fine crops of grain were grown, wheat\r\nespecially, in the earlier years of the settlement. Fruit is also\r\ngrown to a considerable extent in some localities with profit.\r\nOrchards were planted in the town nearly a hundred years ago by\r\nRobert Griffith, John Miller, Andrew Graham, Hamilton Morrison and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe bonding of the town in aid of the Wallkill Valley and other\r\nrailway construction had a depressing effect upon the people and\r\ntheir property for a time, and there was much opposition to the\r\nscheme, among the farmers especially. But the advantages of the\r\nrailways became apparent in a few years, and probably no one would\r\nnow care to abolish the present traffic facilities afforded or longer\r\nregrets the cost.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Wallkill Valley Railway to Montgomery, in 1866 was\r\na most important event for the town and county.\r\n\r\nThe Walden Woolen Factory was established in 1823 by Jesse Scofield\r\nand Dr. Coburn. It was at first known as the \"Franklin Company.\"\r\nThere were frequent changes in the firm and management in the\r\nsucceeding years. But for over fifty years this old plant was the\r\nmost important business feature of Walden, and it had much to do with\r\nits early growth and development. The buildings were of stone and of\r\nthe most durable character, and the water-power ample.\r\n\r\nThe New York Knife Company has long been regarded among the largest\r\ncutlery plants in the United States. It was organized in 1852 and\r\noperated at Matteawan, Dutchess County, until 1856, when it was moved\r\nto Walden to the building formerly used as a cotton factory. Table\r\nand pocket cutlery of every kind and quality are made in this\r\nestablishment, which has achieved world-wide fame in the hardware\r\ntrade, domestic and foreign. Thomas W. Bradley was long the leading\r\nspirit of the concern, being the active superintendent as well as the\r\npresident of the company. He served with valor and distinction in the\r\nCivil War, and became prominent in the military affairs of the State\r\nafterwards. He also served in the State Assembly in 1875-76, and at\r\npresent represents this district in Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Walden Condensed Milk Company was organized in 1864 with a\r\nproposed capital of $50,000. But it was reorganized three years later\r\nunder the name of the Highland Condensed Milk Company. The\r\nenterprise was finally abandoned soon afterward and the buildings\r\nwere used by the Walden Soap Works. The Walden Brickyard began\r\noperations in 1868 with James Gowdy at its head. The Walden Knife\r\nCompany was established in 1870 with W. E. Gowdy as president. It is\r\nentirely devoted to pocket cutlery. In 1891 Mr. Edward Whitehead\r\nbecame its president, since which time the industry has forged\r\nrapidly ahead, with the annual payroll exceeding a quarter of a\r\nmillion dollars. The Schrade Cutlery Company was organized in 1904.\r\nIt is under the direct management of George Schrade and his brother,\r\nJ. Louis Schrade. The Rider-Ericsson Engine Company, manufacturers of\r\nhot air pumping engines, is also a very important industry, giving\r\nemployment to 125 men. The Wooster Manufacturing Company, makers of\r\npants and overalls, conducts an extensive and increasing business.\r\nThe firm of William Crabtree & Sons, manufacturers of worsted yarns\r\nwith plants in Montgomery village and Newburgh, conducts an\r\nimportant industry. This was established in 1880 by William Crabtree\r\nand Arthur Patchett, both now deceased. Two hundred persons are given\r\nemployment by this progressive firm.\r\n\r\nThe New York Condensed Milk Company established a very extensive\r\nbranch of its business just north of Walden in 1880, at an initial\r\ncost of $200,000, and the buildings and entire plant have been\r\ngreatly enlarged and improved since that time. It was intended to\r\nreceive the milk from 5,000 cows at the outset. John G. Borden, who\r\nbecame one of the most prominent and progressive men in that region\r\nin after years, was the first president of this important plant.\r\nSince his death the great enterprise, with its model farms, has been\r\ncarried on most successfully by his daughters, and it is still one of\r\nthe great show places of this region of the State. The farms, though\r\nmainly in Ulster County, are highly cultivated and operated under the\r\nmost modern methods.\r\n\r\nHISTORIC HOMES.\r\n\r\nThe Colden house, on the Montgomery and Newburgh State road, at\r\nColdenham, was built in 1765 by Cadwallader Colden, Jr. His father,\r\nDr. Cadwallader Colden settled in Coldenham in 1728 on his patent of\r\n3,000 acres of land--he was the surveyor general of the province for\r\neleven years, lieutenant governor for thirteen years and acting\r\ngovernor in 1761, 1763, 1769 and 1774. He gave to Cadwallader, Jr.,\r\non his marriage, five hundred acres of land, including the site on\r\nwhich this house stands. The land was all in woods, and Cadwallader,\r\nJr., began at once to clear part of it for farming purposes; with his\r\nown hands he felled the first tree, and up-rooted the first stub.\r\nAfter a few years the first dwelling he erected gave place to this\r\npermanent stone structure, then, one of the finest dwellings of the\r\nperiod. In it he lived a useful life, esteemed by all who knew him,\r\nand in it he died mourned as a public benefactor. Some years ago an\r\naddition to the house was built in the rear, and more recently a\r\nmansard roof and other improvements were added. The date of the\r\nerection of the building, and the names of its builders, are cut on a\r\nstone in the upper front center. Its historical associations, past\r\nand present, cover a period of one hundred and seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nThe Thomas Colden mansion was built by Cadwallader Colden, Jr., for\r\none of his sons. It is situated about a mile north of Coldenham, at\r\nColden Hill, near what was the Newburgh and Ellenville plank road.\r\nIt is a frame building with hipped-roof and is kept in excellent\r\ncondition. After the death of Thomas Colden it was occupied by\r\nCadwallader C. Colden, and more recently by Messrs. John and Joseph\r\nKelly.\r\n\r\nThe Haines house is situated about a mile east of the Goodwill\r\nChurch, and a short distance south of the highway known as the\r\nHadden road. It was built by Benjamin Haines who came into the\r\nprecinct in 1739. The year in which the house was erected is not\r\nknown, but it is probably the oldest house in the town. During recent\r\nyears it has been occupied only for short intervals, and the walls\r\nare crumbling. This house is known as the Old Hadden house, having\r\nbeen in the possession of successive generations of that family for\r\nmore than one hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe Hill Brick house situated about three miles east of Montgomery on\r\nthe State road was built by Nathaniel Hill in 1774 and occupied by\r\nhis son, Peter, who was a soldier in the War of the Revolution. At\r\nhis death the ownership and occupancy of the homestead passed to his\r\nson, Nathaniel P. Hill, who was a prominent man--was sheriff, member\r\nof congress, and filled other important positions. One of his sons,\r\nNathaniel P., had also attained prominence as U. S. senator from\r\nColorado.\r\n\r\nThe Van Keuren Stone house, now generally known as the Downs House,\r\nabout a mile west of Goodwill church, on the road to Montgomery, was\r\nbuilt in part by Hendricus Van Keuren in 1768, and in part by a\r\nprevious owner probably John McNeal. The house is in excellent\r\ncondition and is, perhaps, the oldest unchanged occupied house in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe Beemer house, situated on the old Stage road from Goshen to\r\nAlbany, nearly three miles north of Montgomery and about two miles\r\nwest of Walden, was built by Adam Beemer in 1770. It is a framed\r\nbuilding and has been recovered and repaired, but otherwise not\r\nmaterially changed. It is now in fair condition.\r\n\r\nThe Hans Youngblood house is situated on the road leading from the\r\nSearsville road north to the former site of Graham's church on the\r\nPine Bush road. Tradition says it was built before the French and\r\nIndian War. It was used for a German school in 1761, and is not\r\noccupied at present.\r\n\r\nThe Kidd house in the extreme southeasterly part of Walden was\r\nprobably built in part by Alexander Kidd, who settled there in 1736.\r\nThe year it was built is not known. Alexander Kidd was among the\r\nfirst elders of Goodwill Church. His descendants are numerous.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nOne of the ancient landmarks is the Montgomery High School, formerly\r\nknown as the Montgomery Academy. This noted school is as old as our\r\nNational Government. It had its inception in 1787, the year that the\r\nNational Constitution was framed. It was the fourth oldest academy in\r\nthe State, having been incorporated in 1791. Before 1787 the\r\ninhabitants of the village and surrounding country felt the need of a\r\nschool of a high grade, and during that year erected a school\r\nbuilding on lots reserved in part for school purposes, when the\r\nvillage was first surveyed and laid out. In the autumn of 1787\r\nteachers were employed and the school opened for pupils. During 1790\r\nsteps were taken to incorporate the institution and place it under\r\nthe care of the regents of the State University, as appears from the\r\nfollowing application and petition:\r\n\r\n\"To the Regents of the University of the State of New York: Be it\r\nknown that a certain tract of land pleasantly situated in the town of\r\nMontgomery, in the county of Ulster, in the center of a populous,\r\nfertile and wealthy country, hath lately been purchased, and a large\r\nand convenient building of two stories high erected and completed\r\nthereon, for the use of a public academy for the instruction of youth\r\nin the learned languages and other branches of useful knowledge,\r\nthat the expense of the undertaking hath been defrayed by the free\r\nand liberal benefactions of individuals, of whom the subscribers\r\nconstitute more than one-half with respect to the contributions\r\nraised and collected to found said academy, and that a gentleman of\r\nliberal education, of very competent abilities and irreproachable\r\nmoral character has been procured, with a tutor, to teach in said\r\nacademy.\r\n\r\n\"The subscribers, pursuant to an act of the Legislature of the State\r\nof New York entitled an act to institute a university within this\r\nState, and for other purposes, passed April 13, 1787, respectfully\r\nmake the application to the regents of said University requiring\r\nthat the said academy may be incorporated agreeably to the said law,\r\nand be subject to the visitation of the said regents, and they do\r\nhereby nominate Arthur Parks, Matthew Hunter, Benjamin Sears, Henry\r\nVan Keuren, Solomon Slight, Joseph Barber, James Clinton, Moses\r\nFreleigh, Daniel Bull, James Hunter, Peter Hill, David Galatian,\r\nJohannes Miller, Severyn T.

The school prospered and\r\ngreater accommodations became necessary. In 1823 the main part of the\r\npresent brick building was erected at a cost of about $5,400. Nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of the cost was paid by State moneys; the remaining third\r\nwas raised by subscription through the activity and persistence of\r\nJohannes Miller.\r\n\r\nThe academy continued to prosper until the free school system was\r\nadopted, when it began to decline. In 1881 it was transferred by the\r\ntrustees to the Board of Education of the Montgomery Union Free\r\nSchool, of which it is now (1908) the academical department. The\r\nfollowing is a list of principals of the academy since it was\r\nincorporated: Rev. Alexander Miller, Nathaniel Howell, Nathan H.\r\nWhite, Reuben Neely, James King, Prof. Stansbury, William H. Weller,\r\nRev. John McJimsay, Prof. Wilson, Jacob C. Tooker, twenty years,\r\nSilas S. Harmon, seven years, Rev Samuel B. Bell, D. D., Joseph M.\r\nWilkins, three years, Robert Simpson, Daniel K. Bull, Prof. Lasher,\r\nProf. Graham, Prof. Gunnison, Theron Little, Prof. Stevens, Prof.\r\nBeardsley, Prof. Cone, Benjamin C. Nevins, Prof. Demarest, Prof.\r\nRouse. This famous academy reached the zenith of its prosperity\r\nunder Professors Tooker and Harmon.\r\n\r\nThe town is divided into thirteen school districts and parts of\r\ndistricts; of these, twelve have school-houses in the town. These\r\ndistrict schools will compare favorably with those of any other town.\r\nIt appears from trustees' reports for 1907 that the whole number of\r\nchildren of school age (between five and eighteen), residing in the\r\ntown that year was 1,337; of these 1,299 attended school. The average\r\ndaily attendance of these children was 850. The number of teachers\r\nemployed at the same time was thirty-four. The total cost of\r\nsustaining these schools was $25,330; of this sum $17,892 was raised\r\nby district tax. The value of school-houses and sites was $42,450.\r\nTwo of the districts (Montgomery and Walden), are union free school\r\ndistricts. The former was established in 1881 and now (1908), employs\r\nsix teachers. The first principal was Reuben Fraser. The present\r\nboard of education is: Dr. E. Ross Elliott, William Eager, William H.\r\nSenior, John A. Crabtree and William S. Hanlon. The latter was\r\norganized in 1859 and now employs eighteen teachers. The Board of\r\nEducation in 1908 is: Sanford Abrams, Henry E. Williams. Frank\r\nBenedict, Benjamin S. French, Harry Hollingsworth, Dewitt C.\r\nDominick. There is one parochial school in the town.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\nThere are many ancient churches in this town. It was a sturdy\r\nChristian people that first settled in this region. After building\r\ntheir grist mills and providing themselves and families with\r\nlog-cabins, or other rude shelter from the storm and cold of the\r\nsevere winters which then prevailed, their next thought was for the\r\nchurch, where they might enjoy religious worship, hear the Scripture\r\nexpounded and meet together in praise and song.\r\n\r\nThe oldest and best known of these churches in those early days was\r\nthe _Good Will Presbyterian Church._ This was established by the\r\nScotch-Irish settlers who came into the region in 1724. The earliest\r\nrecords of this old church seem to have been lost. But the\r\norganization was represented in the Synod of Philadelphia in 1729 by\r\nJohn McNeal as commissioner. This date has, therefore, been taken for\r\nthe establishment of the church, although it was doubtless in\r\nexistence there some years earlier. The settlers of the region being\r\nlong known as \"the people of Wallkill,\" this church went under the\r\nname of the Wallkill Church, though incorporated under the name first\r\nmentioned. The first church structure is believed to have been\r\nerected in 1735, although there was some rude building set apart for\r\nreligious worship some years before this. The building was improved\r\nand enlarged from time to time, some $8,000 having been expended upon\r\nit in this way in 1871. During the one hundred and seventy-nine years\r\nof its existence it has had but nine pastors: Rev. Joseph Houston,\r\nJohn Moffatt, Andrew King, Robert W. Condit, William Blain, David M.\r\nMaclise, D.D., James M. Dixon, D.D., David F. Bonner, D.D., and the\r\npresent pastor, Rev. John H. Thompson, who has served the church for\r\nseventeen years.\r\n\r\n_The Reformed Church of Montgomery_ was founded mainly by the German\r\nelement in 1732. As the population increased divisions arose in this\r\nchurch and several other churches were formed from it. The first\r\nhouse of worship was a log structure built in 1732. And it is said\r\nthat the entrance of this old church was by means of a ladder placed\r\non the outside. All these early records were kept in the Dutch\r\nlanguage, and the services were also conducted in Dutch for the first\r\nfifty years. Then for a time each alternate Sunday the English\r\nlanguage was used. Rev. John Michael Kern seems to have been the\r\nfirst settled pastor. He came in 1772 and resigned in 1776. Rev.\r\nG. W. Mancius, of the old parent _Kingston Dutch Church,_ had been\r\nacting as a supply previous to that date, until his death in 1762.\r\nThree different church buildings have occupied the site since the old\r\nblock house was taken down in 1760. The first was a frame structure\r\nerected immediately thereafter. The church contained sixty-eight\r\npews, forty-six of which were occupied at a rental of 96L 8S. Pews\r\nfor the elders and deacons were on the right and left of the\r\nold-fashioned pulpit. Among the names of the pew-holders are found\r\nthose of Rockefeller, Youngblood, Mould, Decker, Weller, Robinson,\r\netc., ancestors of many well-known families. The modern name of the\r\nchurch for years has been \"the Brick Church of Montgomery.\" The\r\npresent pastor is Peter Crispell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of Pews of the Old Dutch Church at Montgomery,\r\nerected in 1760.]\r\n\r\n_The St. Andrew's Church_ at Walden, before alluded to, is another\r\nancient religious society. This people passed through a troublous\r\n{_sic_} existence during the Revolution, and the parish was left\r\nvacant for some years until 1790. Finally, after emerging from a\r\nheavy debt, a new church was erected in the village of Walden in 1827.\r\nThen after many changes in rectors, another new church was decided\r\nupon in 1870. This with the parsonage cost $18,000, and in 1880 the\r\nchurch was finally consecrated free from debt.\r\n\r\n_The Reformed Presbyterian Church of Coldenham_ was organized in\r\n1795, and a house of worship built four years later. This was\r\nreplaced by a new structure in 1838. Dr. Alexander McLeod was the\r\npastor from 1800 to 1812. The present pastor, Rev. Thomas Patton,\r\nwas installed in 1893.\r\n\r\n_The Reformed Dutch Church of Berea,_ which came as a secession from\r\nthe _Goodwill Church,_ got its first pastor in 1823, Rev. James Ten\r\nEyck, the congregation having been incorporated two years before.\r\nWhen the first little church was built it was surrounded by a forest,\r\nthe timber for the building being cut from the site itself.\r\n\r\n_The First Reformed Church of Walden_ was incorporated in 1870,\r\nalthough the society was formed forty years before, and the church\r\nbuilding was completed in 1838 at a cost of $12,000. Some $5,000 more\r\nwas afterward spent upon the parsonage. Rev. M. V. Schoonmaker was\r\nthe minister from 1849 to 1888. The present minister, Rev. W. W.\r\nSchomp, was installed in 1897.\r\n\r\n_The First Presbyterian Church of Montgomery_ was incorporated in\r\n1832 and Rev. James O. Stokes was the first pastor. There were many\r\nchanges in this pastorate in the succeeding years, and the debt piled\r\nup gradually until it reached $2,300 in 1848, a parsonage having been\r\nbuilt meanwhile. This debt was, however, fully met that year under\r\nthe pastorate of Rev. E. R. Fairchild, whose health soon failed,\r\nhowever. Rev. J. C. Forsyth was installed in 1875 and he continued in\r\nthat field for many years.\r\n\r\n_The Methodist Church of Montgomery,_ was organized in 1829 with Rev.\r\nB. Howe and J. W. Lefever as priests. The \"table expenses\" of Mr.\r\nHowe were $100 and those of Lefever $50, which was in addition to the\r\ndisciplinary allowance. A small church was built that year and a\r\nparsonage four years later.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 an Episcopal mission was established in Montgomery.\r\n\r\n_The Walden Methodist Church_ was incorporated in 1850. Previous to\r\nthat the \"classes\" there were under the pastoral care of the\r\nMontgomery preachers. In fact, it was not until 1866 that the Walden\r\nChurch became an independent charge. Then a parsonage was built and\r\nthe church building was enlarged and improved in 1870 at a cost of\r\n$6,000. In 1893 it was removed to the east side of the church lot and\r\nremodeled.\r\n\r\n_The Church of the Holy Name_ in the village of Montgomery was\r\nincorporated in 1870. Rev. Hugh S. O'Hare was the pastor.\r\n\r\nThe inception of the _Church of the Most Precious Blood_ in Walden\r\nwas in 1887. Services were held in Lustig's and later in Condon's\r\nhall. The church was dedicated by Bishop Farley July 5, 1896. The\r\nofficiating priests have been Rev. C. A. Meredith, Rev. P. Morris and\r\nRev. F. C. Lenes.\r\n\r\nAmong the recent church organizations of the town is the _People's\r\nBaptist Church_ at Maybrook, erected in 1906. No settled pastor.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the old cities of the dead date back to 1725. The Wallkill\r\nValley Cemetery Association was organized in 1865 and the first\r\nburial made May 1, 1867. This cemetery commands general admiration in\r\nthe beauty and grandeur of its location. It comprises forty-one acres\r\nand the interments exceed 2,000. In 1905 Colonel Thomas Bradley\r\nerected here a bronze statue, \"The Volunteer,\" memorial to Company H,\r\n124th Regiment. Other burial places are Goodwill, St. Mary's,\r\nRiverside, Berea, Brick Church and Coldenham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wickham T. Shaw.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF MOUNT HOPE.\r\n\r\nBy Wickham T. Shaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION, AREA, ETC.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the smaller towns of Orange County and it is located\r\nin the acute angle of the western boundary line of the county formed\r\nby the indentation of Sullivan County. The territory of the town is\r\ndiamond-shaped. The Shawangunk stream, which flows through the town\r\nlengthwise toward the northeast, leaves it in the apex of the angle\r\nand then forms the boundary line separating Orange from Sullivan, as\r\nwell as the northwestern bounds of the towns of Wallkill and\r\nCrawford.\r\n\r\nIt is bounded on the north by Sullivan County and a very small part\r\nof the town of Wallkill, east by that town, south by the towns of\r\nWawayanda and Greenville, and west by the town of Deer Park.\r\n\r\nThe area of the town is now placed at 16,104 acres. The assessed\r\nvaluation of all the real and personal property, as reported by the\r\nassessors in 1906, was $632,075, upon which the tax levy for that\r\nyear was $3,903.36. In 1880 this land was valued at $673,470, and the\r\nannual tax was $5,157.79. But it would be manifestly unfair to assume\r\nthat the land is less valuable now than it was twenty-five years ago.\r\nThe average town assessor in the State of New York, under the\r\nprevailing political conditions and customs, is largely a creature of\r\ncircumstance, with strange vagaries in judgment, if indeed he is\r\ncalled upon to exercise any judgment at all under the official\r\nlimitations of his position. Then, too, standards of value have\r\ngreatly changed during that time.\r\n\r\nThis Mount Hope territory lies wholly north of the old county line\r\nwhich originally divided Orange from Ulster County.\r\n\r\nNATURAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe Shawangunk mountain range in the western border of the town is\r\nthe most important topographical feature. This northern spur of the\r\nAlleghenies is known as the Blue Mountains in New Jersey and the\r\nKittatiny Mountains in the State of Pennsylvania. Beginning in the\r\ncentral part of Ulster County the general trend of the range is\r\ntoward the southwest for some 250 miles. There are few isolated\r\npeaks, and the greatest altitude reached is about 1,800 feet above\r\ntide. The more notable elevations of this range are Sam's Point, near\r\nEllenville, Sky Top and Eagle's Cliff at Lake Mohonk, all of which\r\nare in Ulster County. The Indian word Shawangunk, which has been used\r\nto designate this range since the settlement of the region,\r\nsignifies \"great wall\" in the aboriginal vernacular, which in fact\r\nseems especially appropriate as a descriptive title.\r\n\r\nThe eastern slopes of these mountains are uniform and well adapted to\r\ncultivation, even to their summits, in most instances. But on the\r\nwestern side they are broken and precipitous. The approach from the\r\neast has been fitly described by an old writer in the following\r\nlanguage: \"The eye rests upon fields of grain and grass, upturned\r\nfurrows, the verdure of waving trees and the homes of thrifty\r\nhospitality, spread out from valley to crest, over the south and the\r\nfar north, in unwearying {_sic_} panoramic beauty--a patchwork of\r\ngold and green, of brown and gray, of white and red.\"\r\n\r\nThe Shawangunk River is another dominating feature in this Mount Hope\r\ntownship. Rising in the adjoining town of Greenville on the south,\r\nthis stream enters the Mount Hope territory near the middle of the\r\nsouthern boundary line and flows northeasterly through the central\r\nportion of the town, leaving the north boundary line at the apex of\r\nSullivan County, as before stated.\r\n\r\nThe Little Shawangunk rises at Shawangunk Lake, on the eastern border\r\nof the town, flows northward along the line some four or five miles,\r\nthen crosses over into the town of Wallkill, anon reentering Mount\r\nHope in the northeast corner, and finally unites with the parent\r\nstream in the western bounds of Wallkill. There are several small\r\ntributaries which enter the Shawangunk from the west and drain the\r\nmountain slopes effectually.\r\n\r\nThis territory also presents many geological features of interest\r\nwhich have attracted considerable attention in past years. Here, as\r\nelsewhere in this mountain range, rich mineral deposits have been\r\nfound. Lead, copper and zinc ores were discovered many years ago, and\r\nnumerous mining companies have been formed in the town.\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nThis being one of the newer towns of the County, having been taken\r\nfrom the towns of Wallkill and Deer Park in 1825, the details\r\npertaining to its early settlement are of course embodied in the\r\nhistory of those towns and cannot well be treated separately in this\r\nplace at much length.\r\n\r\nAmong the early pioneers in this section was John Finch, who settled\r\nin what was afterward known as Finchville. The records show he was\r\nthere in 1733 at least. He came from Horseneck, Conn., settling first\r\nat Goshen, where it was said in after years he was the first adult\r\nperson to receive burial in the Goshen churchyard.\r\n\r\nJasper Writer came from Germany, and after spending a few years in\r\nPhiladelphia he removed to this section and settled on what was\r\nafterward known as the Writer farm. This was probably before 1763, as\r\nhe was over a hundred years old when he died in 1842.\r\n\r\nAshbel Cadwell was another early settler here, and his grandson,\r\nHarvey R. Cadwell, in later years became a prominent citizen of\r\nOtisville.\r\n\r\nThe Green family was also among the early settlers here. Israel\r\nGreen, the pioneer, started at Middletown, and he had many children,\r\nsome of whom lived in the Otisville section. Daniel Green, his\r\nbrother, settled near Finchville. William Shaw must also be numbered\r\nwith the well known Mount Hope pioneers, and he settled near Howells\r\nsome years before the Revolution and left many worthy descendants in\r\nthat region.\r\n\r\nStephen St. John was another enterprising and public spirited citizen\r\nof that little village. James Finch served in the militia during the\r\nRevolution for more than three months, and also in the French and\r\nIndian war in 1755 and 1756. In his youthful days he served as valet\r\nto General Abercrombie at Fort Stanwix.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Woodward, already mentioned, came into the section in 1773\r\nfrom Stonington, Conn. He served several sessions in the Legislature,\r\nwas a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1821, and was state\r\nsenator from 1827 to 1830. His son Charles also represented his town\r\nin the Legislature in 1863 and 1864.\r\n\r\nJoshua Corwin was another Mount Hope pioneer who came there sometime\r\nbefore the Revolution, coming from Southold, L. I. He had eight\r\nchildren, who settled on an extensive tract of land in that region.\r\n\r\nJacob Wiggins came very soon after the Revolution and settled two\r\nmiles south of Otisville.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE TOWN.\r\n\r\nThe act of incorporation of Mount Hope was passed in 1825, as before\r\nstated. But the new town was then named \"Calhoun\" in honor of the\r\ndistinguished South Carolina Senator, John C. Calhoun, whose\r\npatriotic course as secretary of war during the contest with Great\r\nBritain in 1812 won him great favor with the people of this entire\r\nregion. But they soon regretted this action and the honor conferred\r\nbecause of Calhoun's course and policy during the nullification\r\ndiscussions of 1831 and 1832. There was a violent revulsion of public\r\nopinion and everybody wanted to drop this now unpopular name of the\r\ntown without ceremony, thus showing their open disapproval of the new\r\npolicy of the Southern statesman. A public meeting was held, the old\r\nname was dropped with a heavy thud and the present title of \"Mount\r\nHope\" was unanimously adopted with much enthusiasm. In response to a\r\npopular petition sent to the Legislature in 1833 a law was passed\r\nMarch 14 of that year discarding the old name and ratifying the new\r\none. The plan of thus honoring a political favorite of the hour,\r\nhowever distinguished and popular he might be, had proved a dangerous\r\nexperiment even in those eight short years, and the people were now\r\nresolved to adopt some title for their town which could not be\r\naffected by the sands of time or the progress of human events.\r\n\r\nWhile all the earlier records of this town were destroyed by fire in\r\n1848, the account of the first town meeting, which was held at the\r\nhouse of Joseph Conklin, April 5, 1825, is happily preserved in the\r\nbooks of Deer Park. Joseph Chattle and Richard Penny were the\r\npresiding justices of the peace. One hundred and fifty dollars were\r\nraised for the support of the poor for the ensuing year and $35 for\r\nthe maintenance of bridges. Joseph Chattle was chosen the first\r\nsupervisor and Joseph Conklin town clerk. While many of the principal\r\nofficers were chosen by ballot, all the minor town officials were\r\nselected by the primitive method of raising of hands. Four constables\r\nwere chosen, six fire masters, four fence viewers and forty-one\r\nhighway masters. Just what the duties of the latter were can only be\r\nconjectured, as very little attention was paid to the public roads of\r\nthat period or their repair, and fortunately so, perhaps, because of\r\nthe primitive and defective methods in vogue. The official list of\r\nthe town included also three assessors, two overseers of the poor,\r\nthree commissioners of highways, three school commissioners and three\r\nschool inspectors.\r\n\r\nThe first town meeting after the fire was in 1849. At that time the\r\nrather extravagant civil list of the town had been somewhat reduced\r\nin number. One hundred dollars were then raised for repairs to roads\r\nand bridges.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in passing that in 1906 the sum raised for\r\nthe maintenance of public roads alone in the town under the money\r\nsystem of road work was $2,743.33. Of this amount $933.12 was\r\nreceived from the State and $260 from the poll tax.\r\n\r\nLITTLE SHAWANGUNK KILL.\r\n\r\nHeretofore it has been said that the little Shawangunk Kill, in this\r\ntown, was of such little importance that historians declined to\r\nmention it, yet this stream, lying practically all in the town, was\r\nat one time the scene of five thriving saw-mills in operation, but\r\nwhich have since disappeared. Yet the city of Middletown in 1890 saw\r\na basis of great water works in this stream, and just from the line\r\nat the headwaters of this kill in the town of Wallkill, erected a\r\nreservoir which was known as Highland Lake, containing about\r\n500,000,000 gallons of water. On April 22, 1901, just below Highland\r\nLake and in the town of Mount Hope, the city of Middletown decided to\r\nerect another lake, and the contract was let to Charles Sundstrom of\r\nthe city of Middletown, who, by the erection of what was known as\r\nShawangunk, Greenleaf and Steward dams, impounded a large quantity of\r\nwater, which was to form a part of the Middletown system.\r\n\r\nThis work was at the cost of something like $57,000, and was\r\nconnected with Monhagen Lake by a twenty-inch conduit, and also a\r\ntwenty-four-inch conduit was extended in a westerly direction to a\r\npoint in the Shawangunk Kill, above Mount Hope, from which it was\r\nintended to take water at high times, and conduct it to what was\r\ncalled Shawangunk reservoir.\r\n\r\nThis reservoir when full contains over 434,000,000 gallons of water,\r\nand has an acreage of about 102 acres, on what was formerly known as\r\nthe Greenleaf farm. It will be observed that Highland Lake had been\r\nerected some fourteen years, but since Shawangunk Lake was erected,\r\nlitigation sprang up from the mill owners on the big Shawangunk Kill,\r\nas far north as Pine Bush, and all the farmers on the line of the\r\nlittle Shawangunk Kill were brought into proceedings for\r\ncondemnation, and the payment of damages for the taking of this\r\nwater, and this litigation, which continued some two or three years,\r\nwas finally settled in the year 1907, when all water rights to both\r\nkills were finally determined, but the city of Middletown had paid in\r\nexpenses and damages something like $25,000.\r\n\r\nVILLAGES.\r\n\r\nThe village of Mount Hope is in the southwestern part of the town.\r\nThis name was bestowed long before the formation of the town itself,\r\nwhich was evidently named after the old village. The site of the\r\nhamlet is a commanding elevation, and there is a charming view of the\r\nsurrounding landscape on all sides far and near.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Woodward and Dr. Benjamin Newkirk are credited with the\r\nestablishment of the place in May, 1807. On the eighth day of that\r\nmonth, after the \"raising bee\" was over, James Finch, the old\r\nsettler, called the assembly to order and made a very enthusiastic\r\nspeech, during which he christened the place \"Mount Hope\" with proper\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nOtisville was settled in 1816 by Isaac Otis, a merchant from New\r\nYork, and named for him. There were but three houses on the upper\r\nstreet, and probably but little more than a dozen buildings comprised\r\nthe entire village when the Erie Railroad was opened on November 3,\r\n1846.\r\n\r\nThe officials of the road who arrived on the first train dined at the\r\nhotel of Ambrose W. Green, who for many years was one of the leading\r\ncitizens of Otisville. At this time, 1846, Dr. Avery Cook lived and\r\nhad his office near where the depot stands. Galen Otis owned the only\r\nstore which stood where he later built a large square house. Ezra\r\nColeman lived and had his wagon-making shop where Dr. Writer now\r\nlives. Samuel K. Wheat was the harness-maker, and lived where later\r\nJudson Van Duzer lived. Stanford Harding was the blacksmith, and\r\nSquire Baker had a cooper shop. Harvey R. Cadwell, a member of\r\nAssembly in 1862, owned the farm on the north, and Smith Loomis,\r\nfather of Supervisor Charles Loomis, owned the farm on the western\r\nboundary of the village.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Garrett H. Tymeson.]\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse in 1840 was nearly a mile south of the village on the\r\nplains, the present site of the cemetery. A church was also there.\r\nThis same year Algernon Sidney Dodge, son of Benjamin Dodge, of Mount\r\nHope, came to Otisville and leased the store of Galen Otis. Alsop\r\nWoodward Dodge, son of Algernon Sidney Dodge, now resides in\r\nMiddletown, and from him we learned some of the facts contained here.\r\n\r\nAmbrose Woodward Green, mentioned above, was born in the town of\r\nGreenville in 1813. His father was Charles S. Green, and his\r\ngrandfather was Daniel Green, a soldier of the Revolution from Orange\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nAmbrose W. Green settled in Otisville in 1835, and for a time carried\r\non the tailoring business, which he discontinued, and built the\r\nWashington Hotel, now the Greenleaf Hotel, conducting it for some\r\ntime in connection with other business.\r\n\r\nBefore the Erie came to Otisville, Mr. Green owned a market wagon\r\nroute to Newburgh, going twice a week by way of Bloomingburg. While\r\nOtisville remained the western terminal of the Erie, Mr. Green also\r\nowned a stage line to Forestburgh, Sullivan County, connecting with\r\nlines into Pennsylvania for Honesdale and other western points. He\r\nwas interested in building the Otisville and Wurtsboro turnpike. Mr.\r\nGreen sold the Washington Hotel and about 1850 built the hotel near\r\nthe railroad track. While conducting this hotel, he was engaged in\r\nthe lumber and coal business. From 1863 to 1870 he was extensively\r\ninterested in the lead mining operations on Shawangunk Mountain. The\r\ndecline in the value of lead after our Civil War caused the mines to\r\nbe discontinued, and Mr. Green later sold his hotel and removed to a\r\nfarm a couple of miles north of Otisville, where he died in July,\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Erie boomed Otisville for the next few years. A\r\nMethodist and a Presbyterian church were built and a little later a\r\nCatholic church. Several stores and many dwellings were erected.\r\nMarket wagons came here twice a week with farmers' produce for\r\nshipment to New York. Previous to the building of the Midland\r\nRailroad hundreds of teams throughout the winter, while the Delaware\r\nand Hudson Canal was closed, came to Otisville from Sullivan and\r\nwestern Ulster Counties, with leather from the tanneries, and\r\nreturned with the green hides for tanning. For many years, until the\r\nintroduction of refrigerator cars, Otisville was the western terminal\r\nof the milk train.\r\n\r\nGeorge Strickland and Joel D. Northrup, residents of Otisville, were\r\nthe conductors--the latter for many years. The Orange County Express\r\nfor several years went no further west than Otisville. The gravel and\r\nconstruction train for this section, with nearly a hundred employees,\r\nhad its headquarters at Otisville. Until coal was used as the fuel\r\nfor the engines of the Erie, Otisville for many years was the\r\nprincipal point where the thousands of cords of wood were received\r\nwhich the Erie consumed yearly. This wood was all sawed by hand, and\r\nmany men were employed. Many citizens of Otisville found various\r\nkinds of employment with the Erie during these years, and much of the\r\nprosperity of the village came from the dollars left here by the\r\nmonthly pay-car of the Erie.\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS SANATORIUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nTo the historian of the future the name Otisville will be associated\r\nwith one of the great sanitary advances made in this country, namely,\r\nthe establishment, by a municipality, of a tuberculosis sanatorium\r\noutside the political limits of that municipality.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of such a sanatorium was first suggested in 1889.\r\nAt that time, however, not even a medical sentiment was ripe for\r\nsuch a movement. In the succeeding fifteen years, little progress was\r\nmade toward a realization of these plans, and it was not until Dr.\r\nThomas Darlington became commissioner of health that any tangible\r\nresults were achieved. He proved an aggressive and resourceful\r\nchampion. With political, corporate, and private interests leagued\r\ntogether to prevent the city from acquiring a site, it was largely\r\nowing to the indefatigable labors of Dr. Darlington that the most\r\ndetermined opposition to the plan was overcome.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully examining many sites, it was finally determined to\r\nestablish the sanatorium at Otisville, a little village lying in the\r\nShawangunk Mountains, and about seventy-five miles from New York\r\nCity. As a southern exposure was desired, the grounds, covering an\r\narea of over 1,400 acres, were selected on the southeastern slope of\r\none of the most picturesque and most favorably situated mountains of\r\nthe entire range. The grounds have an altitude varying from about\r\n800 feet to 1,500 feet above sea level. The sanatorium property\r\nconsists of what were formerly thirteen separate farms, which were\r\npurchased at different times during the years 1905 and 1906, the\r\nhealth department first taking possession for the city of New York on\r\nDecember 1, 1905.\r\n\r\nTo avoid delay in establishing the institution on a working basis, it\r\nwas deemed best to renovate and remodel the buildings on the\r\nproperty, and use them until such time as the needs of the sanatorium\r\nwould require the erection of new ones. By July, 1906, the\r\ninstitution was ready to receive its first patients, and a year after\r\nthat date had accommodations for about 100.\r\n\r\nSince the sanatorium is designed for the treatment of those ill with\r\ntuberculosis in the early stages of the disease, there is only a\r\nsmall building for hospital accommodations. The rest of the\r\nbuildings, in which the patients practically live outdoors, are\r\nportable houses and shacks. All the frills and ruffles so universally\r\nconnected with the construction of public buildings have been\r\nomitted; everything has been subordinated to that which is best for\r\nthe patients.\r\n\r\nThere are six portable houses, which are set on posts and can be\r\ntaken apart and transferred to any location desired. The houses all\r\nmeasure ten by sixty feet, and are divided into five rooms. The\r\ncenter room, heated on cold days, is used as a bathing and dressing\r\nroom, as well as a sitting room in inclement weather. Those on\r\neither side are used as bed rooms. Each room has four windows, two of\r\nwhich are always open and so arranged as to avoid all draughts. Each\r\nroom contains one bed. The two rooms on either end are entirely open\r\non the three sides, a fine screen only enclosing to keep out insects,\r\netc. Heavy canvas curtains are folded in a roll outside, and can be\r\ndropped in stormy weather. These end rooms each accommodates two\r\npatients, thus making a capacity of six to each house.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1906 a one-story and a two-story shack were\r\nerected for the additional accommodation of patients; and during 1907\r\ntwo single-story shacks and one small house were built.\r\n\r\nThe shacks are built in the form of the letter T. The stem of the T\r\nconsists of a room containing the washstands, lockers for each\r\npatient, and toilets and baths. In front of this is a sitting room,\r\nand opening from either side of this are the sleeping rooms. The\r\nlatter are practically only verandas, being open in front and on the\r\nside, while for protection against storms and severe winds there is a\r\nsimilar provision to that used on the portable houses; that is, the\r\ncurtains ordinarily rolled up are lowered, shutting off the verandas\r\nfrom the outside. A single-story shack accommodates twelve patients,\r\nsix on each veranda. The two-story shack accommodates just double\r\nthat number, being exactly alike in its two stories.\r\n\r\nA feature of considerable importance in an institution of this kind\r\nis the manner in which the different patients are segregated. As\r\nnearly as possible patients in the same physical condition as well as\r\nthose who are apt to be congenial are assigned to the same quarters.\r\n\r\nEvery patient is closely observed for about ten days after admission.\r\nThe amount and frequency of rest, exercise and work is determined at\r\nall times by the condition of the patients. They are assigned to work\r\naccording to their strength and capabilities. All dining-room duties,\r\nsuch as waiting on the table, washing dishes, and preparing\r\nvegetables, are performed by selected patients who show but slight\r\nlesions, negative sputum, and have no cough. Many of the patients are\r\nable to do farm work, and this keeps them out in the air and relieves\r\ntheir ennui.\r\n\r\nIn a large institution of this kind the problem of sewage disposal is\r\nnot an easy matter. But by the aid of expert sanitary engineers this\r\nhas been satisfactorily overcome. Thousands of feet of pipe have been\r\nlaid, and an up-to-date disposal plant has been erected. The effluent\r\nfrom this plant will have been so purified as to be practically\r\nindistinguishable from pure water.\r\n\r\nAn abundance of pure water has also been provided, and is supplied at\r\na high pressure to all the buildings. Fire plugs are scattered about\r\nthe sanatorium grounds, and a fire-fighting system has been\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nThe sanatorium has its own dairy, for the patients are encouraged to\r\ndrink considerable milk. The cow barn and the milk handling rooms in\r\nconnection with this, are immaculately clean, and this condition is\r\nreflected by the milk, which is of the highest possible purity.\r\n\r\nThe one fact which stands out prominently at the sanatorium is the\r\nbroad foundation on which the whole work has been planned. The work\r\nis being directed with admirable foresight, and will yield immense\r\nreturns in the fight against tuberculosis in New York City. The\r\nsanatorium was established in order to provide a place for treating\r\nthese consumptives of New York who are unable to pay, the large army\r\nwho until now have had merely the clinics and dispensaries, but for\r\nwhom country treatment is most desirable. The city maintains the\r\npatients absolutely free, the only condition being that the disease\r\nis not too far advanced.\r\n\r\nThe present capacity of the institution, about 150, is only a small\r\nfraction of what it will be five or ten years hence. Yet even these\r\nsmall numbers are an immense potential for good when they return to\r\nthe city cured or improved, for they carry with them habits of\r\ncleanliness and personal hygiene and a knowledge of the value of\r\nfresh air, which are of incalculable value not only to them, but to\r\nall with whom they come in contact.\r\n\r\nThe present officers of the institution are: Dr. Thomas Darlington,\r\ncommissioner of health; Dr. Hermann M. Biggs, general medical\r\nofficer; Dr. Irving D. Williams, superintendent; Dr. Edward J.\r\nMcSweenv, resident physician, and Dr. Frank P. Hauser, assistant\r\nresident physician.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS, HAMLETS, MINES.\r\n\r\n_Erie & Jersey Railroad._--In the year 1904 a corporation was\r\norganized, known as the Erie and Jersey Railroad Company, which\r\nostensibly was an independent line, to be built from a point on the\r\nErie railroad west of Guymard, on a circuitous route, to the north of\r\nthe present Erie railroad, to Turner. It was well understood that\r\nthis road was a part of the Erie system, and was to be a double-track\r\nroad, the projectors of which alleged that it would be used for\r\nfreight, but as it shortened the route of the road and was a much\r\neasier grade, when completed, undoubtedly would be used by many fast\r\nexpress trains.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation laws of this State were not elastic enough to permit\r\nof taking property along the line of this route through the courts,\r\nand the greater part of the right of way had to be bought by the\r\ncompany, and fabulous prices were paid for its right of way, which\r\nwas 130 feet wide. About eleven miles of this road is in the town of\r\nMount Hope.\r\n\r\n_The Erie & Jersey Railroad Tunnel._--On August 10, 1905, Bennett &\r\nTalbott, contractors, of Greensburg, Pa., contracted with the Erie &\r\nJersey Railroad Company to build twelve miles of railroad, eleven\r\nmiles of grading, which would require about 1,500,000 cubic yards of\r\nexcavation, and about 15,000 yards of concrete masonry, and one mile,\r\nthree hundred and three feet of tunnel through the Shawangunk\r\nMountains, between Guymard and Howells, N. Y. The road was to be\r\ncompleted within a period of two years. Work was commenced on\r\nSeptember 4, 1905, by sinking a shaft at the center of the tunnel to\r\na depth of 117 feet. Owing to a delay in getting the right of way,\r\nhowever, they were compelled to sink another shaft at the east\r\nportal of the tunnel to expedite the work, beginning on or about\r\nOctober 1, 1905. The west portal of the tunnel was begun on or about\r\nNovember 15 of the same year. The completion of the work was delayed\r\nsomewhat on account of the suspension of work April, 1907. The\r\nexcavation of the tunnel will now be completed on or about the first\r\nof March, 1908, while the arching will be finished some time in July,\r\n1908. The excavation of solid rock required for this work was 180,000\r\ncubic yards. The timber required to support the roof was 1,700,000\r\nfeet, while the amount of concrete sidewall was 8,000 cubic yards.\r\nThe number of brick required was 8,000,000. The machinery used in the\r\nconstruction of this tunnel was two improved Style A Marion\r\nsteam-shovels, known as the \"45-ton.\" Alpha Portland cement was used\r\nfor the masonry. Francis Lee Stuart was chief engineer of this work.\r\n\r\n_Finchville._--This hamlet is in the southwestern part of the town at\r\nthe eastern base of the Shawangunk Mountains. It was founded by\r\nJames Finch, the old settler, in whose honor the name was bestowed.\r\nBut the precise date of this settlement is not accurately disclosed\r\nby the records. It was to this place that many terror-stricken women\r\nand children fled for refuge from the Mamakating Valley during the\r\nIndian troubles there.\r\n\r\n_New Vernon._--This is a small hamlet in the northern border of the\r\ntown. In fact, part of it is in Sullivan County. It was named thus to\r\ndistinguish it from Vernon in New Jersey. It had one church and some\r\ntwenty dwellings in 1860, and has shown no very material increase in\r\nrecent years.\r\n\r\n_Guymard,_ in the western part of the town of Mount Hope, was the\r\nculmination of the plan of the Gumaer brothers to have a railroad\r\nstation nearer Gumaer's, which was on the Delaware & Hudson Canal.\r\nAfter the strenuous times of 1857, labor could be obtained at\r\nsixty-five cents per day, and the Gumaer brothers decided to build a\r\nroad from the canal to the Erie railroad, and then the station was\r\nnamed Guymard.\r\n\r\nAbout 1862 they concluded to extend the new road to the old turnpike\r\non top of the mountain. While constructing that part of the road,\r\nlead was discovered. As a result of this discovery, many mines were\r\nprospected on the Shawangunk Mountain and were operated more or less\r\nfrom 1863 to 1870. Among these was the mine of the Guymard Lead &\r\nZinc Co., from which several carloads of lead were shipped weekly.\r\nAfter the close of the Civil War the price of lead declined, and\r\nconsidering the crude mining methods and the cost involved,\r\neventually the mines were abandoned.\r\n\r\nOf the Gumaer brothers, Peter and Jackson are now living at Guymard.\r\nChauncey Gumaer, son of Peter, having had nearly twenty-five years'\r\nmining experience in Colorado and the West, has returned and is now\r\nworking the old mine at Guymard. With the improved methods of mining,\r\nhe believes his new venture will prove successful.\r\n\r\nAn incident of considerable local historical interest occurred here\r\nin the spring of 1863. The mine at Guymard was being worked by its\r\nowners, when one day one George H. Servoss, an Englishman, arrived\r\nand claimed that he owned the mine and all the mineral rights in this\r\nsection through a grant by Queen Anne of England. He erected a small\r\nbuilding on the grounds and his miners began operations. The rightful\r\nowners were wild with excitement and the news was soon communicated\r\nto others interested in mining in this section at that time. A day\r\nwas appointed, when between 100 and 200 men assembled and tumbled\r\nServoss's building over into the gully below the railroad track and\r\ndrove him and his miners from the mine. This was probably the last\r\nattempt of a subject of Great Britain to claim territory or granted\r\nrights in the United States which had been so definitely decided\r\nnearly a hundred years before by the ancestors of some who took part\r\nin driving this Englishman from his false claim.\r\n\r\nA singular incident in connection was this: Ambrose W. Green, who\r\nkept a hotel at Otisville, and was much interested in mining, was one\r\nof the men who assembled and helped to drive Servoss from his claim\r\nat Guymard. Servoss came to Otisville that night and with some of his\r\nminers stopped at Mr. Green's hotel. Being convinced that Yankee\r\nblood still predominated in this section, Servoss gave up his claim.\r\nWhile stopping with Mr. Green he began prospecting and on June 13,\r\n1863, leased the mineral right of Thomas Hawk of his farm situated\r\nless than a mile above Otisville. Ambrose W. Green witnessed the\r\ndocument and Servoss formed what was known as the Otisville Copper\r\nMining Company, which he worked for some time. Servoss died in New\r\nYork City on December 10, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers' Library was incorporated in October, 1807, just a\r\ncentury ago. Its first meeting was held at the home of Benjamin\r\nWoodward. The original trustees were Benjamin B. Newkirk, Benjamin\r\nWoodward, William Mulock, James Finch, Jr., Peter E. Gumaer, Daniel\r\nGreen, William Shaw, Jr., Stephen Farnum and Peleg Pelton. The\r\nlibrary was established at once and it is said to have contained a\r\nvaluable collection of historical works which were doubtless the only\r\navailable books for such use at that early period of library\r\nliterature. This old library was maintained there some thirty years,\r\nwhich certainly speaks well for the people of that region at that\r\ntime. The educational influences of this old library upon the young\r\npeople of that section during that period are said to have been most\r\nwholesome and of incalculable value.\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF HISTORIC INTEREST.\r\n\r\nOf course the Shawangunk Mountain range is always interesting to the\r\ngeologist and historian. The pass through these mountains at\r\nOtisville is well worth visiting. It was the only break the Erie\r\nengineers could find when they laid out the railway, and they went\r\nover ten miles north of Port Jervis to utilize it.\r\n\r\nThe old Finch homestead at Finchville has long been an object of\r\ninterest, although the old house itself was burned many years ago. It\r\nwas here that the militia halted on their way to the fatal Minisink\r\nbattlefield and took a hurried meal. Resuming their march over the\r\nmountains, it is said very few of the soldiers survived the terrible\r\nencounter and lived to recross those hills and again enjoy Mr.\r\nFinch's hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe huge bones of a noted mastodon, which awakened much popular\r\ninterest at the time, were found deeply embedded in the soil on the\r\nold Allison farm, a short distance from Otisville, nearly fifty years\r\nago. This remarkable find took the imagination back to the primitive\r\nera when these mammoth creatures roamed at will over this western\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIES.\r\n\r\nOf course the primary and paramount interest of the people in this\r\ntown from its early settlement even to the present day, has been\r\nagriculture. The cultivation of the land attracted the settlers\r\nthither and the raising of crops, together with lumbering, were the\r\nleading pursuits in which the residents engaged for over a hundred\r\nyears. The sunny mountain slopes and the alluvial bottoms along the\r\nrivers were well adapted to plant growth, and the farmer obtained\r\ngood results from his labor. Nearly all the ordinary crops to which\r\nthe latitude and climate were suited could be grown with profit. The\r\ntown had its full share in the production of the famous \"Orange\r\nCounty butter,\" which was made in large quantities for a time. But\r\nfor many years past, with the ample railway facilities afforded for\r\nprompt shipment, nearly all the milk produced has been shipped to\r\nNew York direct and the butter-making branch of the dairy interest\r\nhas been almost entirely discontinued. In fact, many of the farmers\r\nhave been buying butter elsewhere for their own use, finding it more\r\nprofitable to sell their milk, which of course has been produced to\r\na far larger extent than ever before.\r\n\r\nMILITARY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThis town east of the mountain range was long regarded as a place of\r\nrefuge for those fleeing from the frequent Indian attacks in the\r\nMamakating Valley. Historic records contain many thrilling and\r\npathetic incidents of this nature, and they are presented in much\r\ngraphic detail, although doubtless based largely upon traditionary\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nAs to the history of Mount Hope during the Revolution, there is none,\r\napart from the annals embraced in the records of the parent towns of\r\nDeer Park and Wallkill, from which Mount Hope was taken forty-five\r\nyears after the settlement of that little dispute with a tyrannical\r\nnation over certain questions regarding human rights and personal\r\nliberty. Concerning the roll of honor, belonging to this territory in\r\nthat war for independence the reader is referred to the records of\r\nDeer Park and Wallkill, found on other pages of this work.\r\n\r\nIn the War of 1812 the Wallkill Regiment was ordered out in full\r\nforce, while the 128th Regiment of Sullivan was drafted into the\r\nservice. This organization then included many men from this Mount\r\nHope section. Those who served in that secondary struggle from here,\r\nmentioned in the records, are Joseph Stanton, Amzi Mapes, John\r\nMulock, Zebulon Giffen, Frederick A. Seybolt, Richard Penny and\r\nCaptain William Mulock.\r\n\r\nDuring the war of the rebellion the town was of course an integral\r\nfactor of the county, and it bore an honored share in that memorable\r\nstruggle. The population being small the number who enlisted in the\r\nservice of the government was not very large. Under the various\r\ncalls of President Lincoln in 1862-1863-1864 some 330 men went forth\r\nfrom this town to serve their country. In addition to this,\r\nfifty-eight were drafted into the service.\r\n\r\nAt a special town meeting held August 9, 1864, and ratified on the\r\ntwentieth of the same month, a tax of $37,000 was ordered for the\r\npayment of bounties at the rate of $800 per man. In February, 1865,\r\nanother tax of $10,000 was authorized for a similar purpose. The\r\ntown was afterward reimbursed by the Government for bounties paid to\r\nthe amount of $11,400. In addition to this, voluntary subscriptions\r\nand contributions amounting to $913 were sent forward at different\r\ntimes. Of the Mount Hope soldiers four were reported killed in\r\naction. The record also contains the names of forty-one other men who\r\nenlisted during 1863 and 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF NEWBURGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY PATENTS.\r\n\r\nWhile Newburgh is the most important and impressive place in Orange\r\nCounty, Newburgh Town, outside of the city, has its facts and points\r\nof interest.\r\n\r\nAfter the annulment, in 1669, of the patent purchased of the Indians\r\nby Governor Dongan, and conveyed by him to Captain John Evans in 1684\r\nin which patent was included the territory of the Newburgh precinct,\r\nthe entire district was conveyed, between 1703 and 1705, in small\r\npatents, ten of which were in the Newburgh precinct, and a list of\r\nwhich is given in the chapter on Newburgh city.\r\n\r\nAll patents were conditioned upon a payment of quit-rent, sometimes\r\nin money, sometimes in wheat or other commodity.\r\n\r\nThe Palatine settlement, including a portion of the present city of\r\nNewburgh and a portion of the town, is elsewhere considered. So are\r\nthe changes and troubles that followed the coming of the new Dutch\r\nand English settlers, resulting in a decision of the council which\r\npractically terminated \"The Palatine Parish by Quassaick.\" Ruttenber\r\nsays that when this decision was rendered the original members of the\r\nparish had long previously removed from it or been laid away in the\r\nquiet church-yard, and adds: \"As a people they were earnest, good men\r\nand women. Wherever their neighbors of subsequent migrations are met,\r\ntheir record compares favorably with that of immigrants from any\r\nother country. No citizens of more substantial worth are found under\r\nthe flag of this, their native land, than their descendants; no\r\nbraver men were in the armies of the Revolution than Herkimer and\r\nMuhlenberg. Had they done nothing in the parish but made clearings in\r\nits forests and planted fields they would be entitled to grateful\r\nremembrance. They did more; they gave to it its first church and its\r\nfirst government; and in all subsequent history their descendants\r\nhave had a part.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the other patents: The Baird patent included the settlement of\r\nBelknap's Ridge, later classed at Coldenham. It was issued to\r\nAlexander Baird, Abraham Van Vleque and Hermans Johnson, and was sold\r\nto Governor William Burnet. The Kipp patent included the district\r\neast, north and west of Orange Lake, and adjoined the Baird patent on\r\nthe south. It was issued to Jacobus Kipp, John Conger, Philip\r\nCortlandt, David Prevost, Oliver Schuyler and John Schuyler. It was\r\ndivided into six parts, and these were subdivided into farms. About\r\n1791 a company of Friends from Westchester County settled on the\r\npatent. They were Daniel, Zephaniah and Bazak Birdsall, John Sutton\r\nand John Thorne. The first purchasers on the Bradley patent are\r\nsupposed to have been Johannes Snyder and John Crowell. The Wallace\r\npatent, issued to James Wallace alone, was afterwards purchased by\r\nJohn Penny, who sold 200 acres of it to Robert Ross, and settled,\r\nwith his seven sons, upon the remainder. The Bradley patent was to\r\nSarah, Catherine, George, Elizabeth and Mary Bradley, and was taken\r\nin their name by their father, Richard Bradley, who thus secured six\r\ntracts, of which that in Newburgh was one. The Harrison patent was to\r\nFrancis Harrison, Mary Fatham, Thomas Brazier, James Graham and John\r\nHaskell. It included the present district of Middlehope, and its\r\nsettlers were influential in the control of the town during its early\r\nhistory. The Spratt patent was in two parcels, 1,000 acres in\r\nNewburgh and 2,000 acres in Ulster. It was issued to Andrew Marschalk\r\nand John Spratt, the latter taking the Newburgh tract. This was\r\npurchased in 1760 by Joseph Gidney, and took the name of Gidneytown.\r\nThe Gulch patent was to Melichor Gulch and his wife and children of\r\nthe original company of Palatines. The Johnson or Jansen patent\r\nadjoined the Gulch patent, and was the first occupied land in the\r\nnorthwestern part of the town.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of these patents resulted in dividing the old precinct\r\nof the Highlands in 1762 into the precincts of Newburgh and New\r\nWindsor, the former embracing the towns of Marlborough and Plattekill\r\nin Ulster County with the present town and city of Newburgh, and the\r\nlatter covering substantially the same territory as now.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT BEGINNINGS.\r\n\r\nThe next April, 1763, Newburgh's first town meeting was held at the\r\nhouse of Jonathan Hasbrouck, now known as Washington's Headquarters,\r\nand these officers were chosen: Jonathan Hasbrouck, supervisor;\r\nSamuel Sands, clerk; Richard Harper, John Winfield and Samuel Wyatt,\r\nassessors; Daniel Gedney and Benjamin Woolsey, poor masters; Jonathan\r\nMcCrary, John Wandel, Burras Holmes, Isaac Fowler, Muphrey Merritt\r\nand Thomas Woolsey, path masters; Nathan Purdy and Isaac Fowler,\r\nfence viewers and appraisers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: N. Barns]\r\n\r\nTen years later Marlborough and Plattekill settlements were set off\r\nas New Marlborough, and left Newburgh with almost the same territory\r\nas that of the present town and city. The first supervisor of this\r\nreduced town was John Flewwelling and the first clerk was Samuel\r\nSands.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the present town embraces 26,882 acres in the\r\nextreme northeast portion of the county. The soil along the river\r\nfront for a distance of five miles is warm, productive and well\r\ncultivated. The rock formations are largely slate and lime. In 1875\r\nits population was 3,538, and the census of 1905 places it at 4,885\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the incorporation of the city of Newburgh, April 25,\r\n1865, the town of Newburgh was invested with the government of its\r\nown officers. The following supervisors have been elected:\r\n\r\nNathaniel Barns, 1866; C. Gilbert Fowler, 1867; Nathaniel Barns,\r\n1868 to 1870; W. A. Pressler, 1871; John W. Bushfield, 1872 to 1877;\r\nHenry P. Clauson, 1878 to 1880; W. A. Pressler, 1881 to 1885; Oliver\r\nLozier, 1886; John W. Bushfield, 1887; Oliver Lozier, 1888 to 1801;\r\nWilliam H. Post, 1892 to 1899; Henry P. Clauson, 1900 to 1906; Fred\r\nS. McDowell, 1907 and 1908.\r\n\r\nEARLY PATRIOTISM.\r\n\r\nBut little need be added to what has elsewhere been sketched\r\nregarding Newburgh's part in the war for independence. Its people\r\nwere prompt in patriotic response to the non-importation resolutions\r\nof the Continental Congress. It was one of the five precincts to\r\npublicly burn the pamphlet assailing those resolutions, entitled,\r\n\"Free Thoughts on the Resolves of Congress,\" and on June 27, 1775,\r\nat a public meeting, appointed a Committee of Safety: Wolvert Acker,\r\nJonathan Hasbrouck, Thomas Palmer, John Belknap, Joseph Coleman,\r\nMoses Higby, Samuel Sands, Stephen Case, Isaac Belknap, Benjamin\r\nBirdsall, John Robinson and others. When the pledge to support the\r\nacts of the Continental and Provincial Congress was ready 174 names\r\nwere voluntarily signed to it and twenty-one of the fifty-four men\r\nwho refused to sign afterward made affidavit that they also would\r\nabide by the measures of Congress and pay their quota of all\r\nexpenses. Some of the thirty-three Tories who stood out were\r\nimprisoned and some were executed. The Newburgh patriots as promptly\r\nreorganized the militia of the precinct. They furnished two companies\r\nfor a new regiment in September, and in December helped to\r\nconstitute a regiment of minute men, and provided its colonel in the\r\nperson of Thomas Palmer. They also, in 1776, organized as rangers or\r\nscouts to prevent attacks from hostile Indians. Throughout the war\r\nthe citizens of Newburgh were conspicuous as volunteers in the\r\nregular army and as local militiamen in the cause of the Revolution,\r\nand were subjected to much inconvenience and many privations in\r\nconsequence of the presence of other troops, as elsewhere stated.\r\nMany of them were killed and many more taken prisoners in the defense\r\nof the Highland forts, after which the poor taxes were increased from\r\n50L to 800L and special donations were collected for those who had\r\nbeen deprived of their husbands or parents.\r\n\r\nThe history of Washington's doings and sayings in and near Newburgh\r\nis so familiar that they need not be repeated here.\r\n\r\nEARLY ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Benevolent Society of the County of Orange was formed in January,\r\n1805, with the following officers: Hugh Walsh, president; Gen. John\r\nSkey Eustace, vice-president; John McAuley, treasurer; William\r\nGardner, Secretary.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch of Newburgh village and city mention has been made of\r\nthe charter provision for a Glebe fair. This fair is believed to have\r\nbeen held occasionally as late as 1805, as there has been found in an\r\nold newspaper notice of one to be held in October of that year, with\r\nan offer of $125 as a premium to the jockey riding the best horse on\r\nthe course of Benjamin Case, $50 to another jockey riding the best\r\nhorse on the following day, and $25 to the jockey riding the best\r\nfilly on the third day.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh Bible Society was organized September 9, 1818, at a\r\nmeeting held in the Presbyterian Church of Newburgh village, after a\r\ndiscourse by Rev. James R. Wilson. The first article of the\r\nconstitution declared that its \"sole object shall be to encourage a\r\nwider circulation of the Scriptures, without note or comment.\" The\r\nfollowing officers were elected: Jonas Story, president; Isaac\r\nBelknap and Joseph Clark, vice-presidents; Rev. John Johnston,\r\ncorresponding secretary; Charles Miller, recording secretary;\r\nBenjamin J. Lewis, treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 the Newburgh Society for Aiding Missions was formed. The\r\nreport said: \"Its design is to be auxiliary to the cause of missions\r\nin general; its funds, at the disposal of a board of managers, are to\r\nbe appropriated from time to time to such societies or other\r\nmissionary objects as may seem to have the most pressing claim to\r\nassistance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh Sabbath School Society was organized in 1816, and the\r\nfollowing officers are found recorded, as chosen in 1823, sixteen\r\nyears afterward: Superintendents, Mrs. Agnes Van Vleeck, Mrs. Mary\r\nG. Belknap, Mrs. Harriet M. Bate, Miss Joanna Schultz; secretary,\r\nMiss Louisa Lewis; treasurer, Miss Jane Carpenter. The secretary, in\r\nher report, stated that the school then consisted of more than 300\r\nscholars, the average attendance being 200, and that there were\r\nthirty-two classes instructed by forty-six teachers and assistants.\r\nShe stated that the number of verses committed to memory during the\r\nyear was 21,440 and of divine songs 8,684.\r\n\r\nEager reports a meeting of the Orange County Medical Society in\r\nNewburgh in October, 1823, which invited the members of the Newburgh\r\nLyceum to attend. Medical and scientific essays were read by Drs.\r\nJohn M. Gough, Francis L. Beattie and Arnell, other essays by George\r\nW. Benedict and Rev. James R. Wilson, and \"the merits of each\r\nunderwent an able discussion.\"\r\n\r\nLOCALITIES.\r\n\r\nJust outside the legal boundary line north of the city of Newburgh is\r\nthe fashionable suburb of Balmville, named after a large Balm of\r\nGilead tree, which is estimated to be one hundred and fifty or more\r\nyears old, and nearly twenty-five feet in circumference. The\r\npopulation is large and wealthy, inhabiting charming country seats.\r\nContinuing northward about two miles is the village of Middlehope,\r\nformerly known as Middletown. It is the center of a prosperous fruit\r\nsection where many varieties of fruit originated with men foremost in\r\npomology. North of this settlement is Cedar Hill Cemetery. The\r\ngrounds are from the design of August Hepp, and are under the control\r\nof the Cedar Hill Cemetery Association, which was organized in 1870,\r\nmainly through efforts of Enoch Carter. Roseton, four miles north of\r\nNewburgh, on the banks of the Hudson, was named after John C. Rose,\r\nwho established extensive brick yards here in 1883. Brick yards have\r\nmultiplied in this section, and destroyed the natural attractions of\r\na once pretty cove. The Dans Kammer, a promontory just beyond, marks\r\nthe northern extremity of Newburgh Bay. Hampton, now known as Cedar\r\nCliff Post-office, is a landing on the Hudson, adjoining the Ulster\r\nCounty boundary line. Savilton, formerly Rossville, is a small\r\ndistrict eight miles northwest of Newburgh city, named from\r\nAlexander Ross. Gardnertown is a small settlement four miles\r\nnorthwest of the city, and was named from the old and numerous family\r\nof Gardners who settled there.\r\n\r\nOrange Lake, now a noted summer resort, was called by the early\r\nsettlers Dutch Bennin Water, and later Machen's Pond, from Captain\r\nMachen, an engineer employed by Congress in 1777 in erecting\r\nfortifications in the Highlands and stretching the huge obstructing\r\nchain across the Hudson. It was also called Big Pond as distinct from\r\nLittle Pond in New Windsor. The lake covers about four hundred acres\r\nand is kept well fed by creeks and large springs. Numerous cottages\r\ndot its shores, and an amusement park is conducted under the\r\nmanagement of the Orange County Traction Company. Extensive\r\nimprovements were made in 1907, including the erection of a large\r\ntheatre and other buildings.\r\n\r\nQuassaick Creek is a fine stream entering the Hudson between Newburgh\r\ncity and New Windsor, and is formed by the united waters of Orange\r\nLake outlet and Fostertown and Gidney's Creeks. It has supplied many\r\nmills and factories with power.\r\n\r\nKing's Hill is a high boundary elevation in the northwest part of the\r\ntown affording an extensive view in all directions. Bacon Hill is\r\nanother, north from King's Hill, at the edge of the town. Limestone\r\nHill is a ridge running north and south two miles northwest of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nFostertown Creek, one of the tributaries of Quassaick Creek, is a\r\nsmall stream which rises in Ulster County and drains a narrow valley\r\nseveral miles in extent. Bushfield Creek also rises in Ulster and is\r\none of the streams which feed Orange Lake.\r\n\r\nEARLY INCIDENTS.\r\n\r\nAmong the \"remarkable incidents\" of early times mentioned by Eager,\r\nare the following: In 1803 the formation of a Druid society,\r\ncomposed, it was said, wholly of deists, whose proceedings were\r\nsecret. In January, 1805, a son of Warren Scott, 14 years old, was\r\ntorn in pieces by wolves in the west part of the town while feeding\r\nhis father's sheep. The wolves at this time also came down and killed\r\nsheep near the village of Newburgh. In 1816 the owners of the\r\nNewburgh ferry first used a horse boat, and on August 13th of that\r\nyear the boat _Jason Rogers_ crossed the river with two horses\r\nattached to a coach and a wagon, seventeen chaises and horses,\r\nanother horse and fifty passengers. In 1817 government officers\r\ninspected ninety tons of cannon made by Mr. Townsend on Chamber's\r\nCreek, and all proved good. They were the first manufactured in the\r\nState, and were of sterling ore from the town of Monroe. November 24,\r\n1824, the schooner _Neptune,_ on the way from New York to Newburgh,\r\nwas upset and sunk, and the most of her fifty or more passengers were\r\ndrowned. She had forty or fifty tons of plaster on board, and the\r\nheavy wind shifted it, which caused the accident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aymar Van Buren.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nCITY OF NEWBURGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewburgh, the chief city of Orange County, with a population of\r\nnearly 27,000, is also the largest commercial city on the Hudson\r\nbetween New York and Albany. It is located on the side hill of a bay,\r\n57 miles from the river's mouth, has a deep and spacious harbor, with\r\ngood docks, and its scenic views and contiguous territory are\r\npeculiarly attractive. The inviting bay and river are in front, and\r\nthe mountains southward and westward have been characterized as\r\n\"Nature's arm thrown lovingly about us.\" In the landward distance\r\nmountains are visible in several directions from the upper town, and\r\nadjacent are fruit and dairy farms on undulating fields, with a\r\nten-mile plain known as \"Highland Terrace.\" A recent local pamphlet\r\nsays of the City of Newburgh: \"As a home-city there is little to be\r\ndesired. It is metropolitan and suburban. It has broad thoroughfares,\r\ngood streets, and provision is now perfected for having $100,000\r\nexpended annually in new pavements. There are numerous breathing\r\nspots. One of the most magnificent views obtainable anywhere in the\r\nHudson Valley is from Downing Park, where from the observatory the\r\ncity appears to be almost beneath your feet. The Hudson River\r\npresents an unobstructed view for miles, and a half dozen ranges of\r\nmountains appear to view. The Catskills at the north, Fishkill and\r\nthe Beacons on the east, Storm King and Crow Nest on the south,\r\nSchunnemunk at the southwest, and the Shawangunk range far to the\r\nwest. At the north end of the city is LeRoy Place, one of the\r\ncoziest and most inviting of the city's little parks. It is\r\nespecially referred to as a resting place for those who find it\r\nconvenient to take a walk to the famed 'Balm of Gilead' tree, one of\r\nthe oldest monarchs of its class to be found for many miles around.\"\r\n\r\nThe near suburban villages tributary to the city have a population of\r\nnearly 50,000, as follows: Fishkill and Matteawan, 1 mile, 13,016;\r\nCornwall, 1 mile, 4,258; Marlborough, 6 miles 3,478; Milton 10 miles,\r\n1,500; Walden, 10 miles, 5,939; Highland Falls, 10 miles, 4,519;\r\nCold Spring, 8 miles, 2,067; New Hamburgh, 10 miles, 500;\r\nWashingtonville, 10 miles, 1,118; New Windsor, 3 miles, 2,392;\r\nNewburgh Town, 3 miles, 4,246. The little hamlets in the vicinity\r\nprobably have a population of 3,000 more.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIEST DAYS.\r\n\r\nThe territory embraced in the town and city was a part of the lands\r\npurchased from the Indians by Governor Dongan in 1864, [_sic_] and\r\nconveyed by him to Captain John Evans in 1694. The conveying patent\r\nwas annulled in 1699, and the district was afterward conveyed in\r\nsmall tracts at different periods, of which ten were included in the\r\nprecinct of Newburgh as it was constituted in 1762. These were: No.\r\n1, German patent, 2,190 acres, issued December 18, 1719; No. 2,\r\nAlexander Baird & Co., 6,000 acres, February 28, 1719; No. 3,\r\nJacobus Kip & Co., 7000 acres, October 17, 1720; No. 4, Ricard\r\nBradley and William Jamison, 1,800 acres, May 17, 1729; No. 5,\r\nJames Wallace, 2,000 acres, January 25, 1732; No. 6, Bradley\r\nchildren, 817 acres, March 26, 1739; No. 7, Francis Harrison & Co.,\r\n5,600 acres, July 10, 1714; No. 8, John Spratt & Co., 1,000 acres,\r\nApril 12, 1728; No. 9, Melchior Gulch 300 acres, October 8, 1719; No.\r\n10, Peter Johnson, 300 acres, October 8, 1719.\r\n\r\nThe original settlement was in 1709 by a party of Germans from the\r\nPalatinate--a strip of German territory along the middle Rhine. In\r\n1708 Louis XIV gave warning to the people of the Palatinate that it\r\nwas to be devastated in order to cripple the enemies of France, and\r\nthis caused a company of twelve families and two bachelors--fifty-three\r\npersons in all--to flee to London. Here Queen Anne interested herself\r\nin their welfare, and sent them to New York, with a guaranty of 9 pence\r\neach for twelve months, and of a grant of land on which to settle.\r\nFrom New York they were moved in the spring to \"Quassaick Creek and\r\nThau-hammer.\" Of the heads of families there were seven husbandmen, a\r\nminister, a stocking maker, a smith, a carpenter and a cloth weaver.\r\nOne of the bachelors was a clerk and the other a husbandman. They were\r\nProtestants and of \"good character.\" as certified by officials in the\r\nvillages where they had lived. Their promised land patent was not\r\nissued until 1719, when it granted to each of the different families\r\nfrom 100 to 300 acres, with 500 acres set apart for the support of the\r\nminister. The settlement was generally called \"The German Patent,\" but\r\nits official title was \"The Glebe.\" The lands for each family extended\r\nfrom the Hudson River west one mile. No. 1 was bounded on the south by\r\nQuassaick Creek, and covered the present site of Newburgh.\r\n\r\nThe immigrants erected a church, cultivated portions of their lands\r\nand maintained their settlement several years. Then sales were made\r\nto newcomers, and there were changes in ownership and population.\r\nAfter twenty or thirty years the later Dutch and English comers were\r\nlargely in the majority, and in 1747 elected trustees of the Glebe,\r\nclosed the church to the Lutheran minister, and in 1752 obtained from\r\nthe governor and council a new charter whereby the revenues might be\r\napplied to the support of a minister of the Church of England, with\r\nthe title of \"Palatine Parish of Quassaick\" changed to \"The Parish of\r\nNewburgh.\" At this time there were forty-three real estate lease\r\nholders in the settlement. Ruttenber characterizes as prominent among\r\nthem the following: Alexander Colden, son of Lieutenant-Governor\r\nColden; Duncan Alexander, brother of William Alexander, the Lord\r\nSterling of the Revolution; James Denton, son of Daniel Denton, the\r\nfirst historian of New York; Jonathan Hasbrouck, from the Huguenot\r\nsettlement of New Paltz. Colden, Denton and Hasbrouck erected grist\r\nmills, and in 1743 Colden obtained a charter for the Newburgh ferry.\r\n\"The names of Hasbrouck and Colden have never been absent from the\r\nlist of inhabitants since 1750,\" says Ruttenber.\r\n\r\nThe trustees elected in 1747 were Alexander Colden and Richard\r\nAlbertson. When the first service was held after the Church of\r\nEngland was substituted, the Lutheran minister and his flock made\r\npublic protest at the door, and afterward went away and had service\r\nin a private house. Tradition says that the Lutherans attempted a\r\nforcible entry, and there was a fight in which the church door was\r\ntorn from its hinges and one Lutheran was killed. This was after the\r\nelection of trustees in 1847, and previous to the receipt of the new\r\ncharter.\r\n\r\nThe new trustees, Colden and Albertson, established a public landing,\r\nstarted agricultural fairs, took temporal charge of the church,\r\nerected a parsonage, a residence and school-house combined for the\r\nschoolmaster, and did much other work which contributed to the growth\r\nof the settlement.\r\n\r\nIn 1762 Newburgh was set off from the precinct of the Highlands and\r\nmade a precinct by itself. In 1767 a petition was granted for\r\nlicenses for more taverns, as being necessary \"to accommodate the\r\ncountry people, travelers and passengers.\" In 1769 a petition asking\r\nfor a charter of lands for the Newburgh mission, signed by\r\nmissionary, vestrymen and wardens, was granted. In 1770 another\r\npetition to the governor for \"a royal charter of incorporation of\r\nSt. George's Church\" was granted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Schoonmaker]\r\n\r\nThe old patent of the Highlands, after serving its purpose 50 years,\r\nhad given way in 1762 to the precincts of Newburgh and New Windsor,\r\nthe latter being constituted nearly as now, and the former embracing\r\nthe towns of Marlborough and Plattekill in Ulster County as well as\r\nthe present town and city of Newburgh.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 the Glebe hamlet comprised about a score of houses, and three\r\nboats owned in town made trips between it and New York.\r\n\r\nTROUBLE AND REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nPassing to the events just preceding the War of the Revolution, when\r\nthe bold and significant non-importation agreement was adopted by the\r\nContinental Congress, and a pledge of association in its support was\r\nopened in every town and precinct, supervised by committees, Wolvert\r\nAcker was chairman of the committee for the precinct of Newburgh.\r\nWhen the signing was finished he made return of 195 signatures and\r\nnames of thirty-nine who had refused to sign. The names of the\r\nsigners follow:\r\n\r\n_Non-Importation Pledge Signers of 1776._\r\n\r\n Richard Albertson       Caleb Chase\r\n Stephen Albertson       Daniel Denton\r\n William Albertson       Daniel Denton, Jr.\r\n Joseph Albertson        Nehemiah Denton\r\n Daniel Aldridge         Samuel Denton\r\n Isaac Brown, M.D.       Nathaniel Denton\r\n Isaac Brown, Jr.        Peter Donelly\r\n Joseph Brown            Benj.

A tavern built in this year of\r\n1776 by Adolph De Grove, on the southwest corner of Water and Third\r\nstreets became Lafayette's headquarters.\r\n\r\nWhen the war became a certainty the control of Hudson River\r\nnavigation became important, and to this end Forts Montgomery,\r\nClinton and Constitution were built. Two out of every five of the\r\nmale population became militiamen, were almost constantly in service,\r\nand levies _en masse_ were frequent. In 1779 Washington established\r\nhis headquarters at New Windsor in the William Ellison house, and\r\nhere they remained until the movement which resulted in the siege of\r\nYorktown in 1781. After its surrender his army returned to the\r\nHighlands, and Washington then made the Hasbrouck house in Newburgh\r\nhis headquarters, retaining them as such until August, 1783.\r\n\r\nBefore the beginning of hostilities in the Revolution two companies\r\nwere organized in Newburgh for a regiment formed in the southern\r\ndistrict of Ulster County, of which Jonathan Hasbrouck, of Newburgh,\r\nwas colonel, and Arthur Smith and Samuel Clark captains of the\r\ncompanies. In the next December a regiment of minute men was\r\norganized, of which Thomas Palmer, of Newburgh, was the colonel. In\r\nthe summer of 1776 a convention directed the general committee to\r\norganize three companies (201 men) of rangers to guard against and\r\nfight Indians. Of one of these Isaac Belknap, of Newburgh, was\r\ncaptain. At this time the aged and those who ordinarily would be\r\nregarded as exempts were pressed into the service. In 1778 the people\r\nwere asked to form companies to repel invasions and suppress\r\ninsurrections, and a company of this kind was formed, with Samuel\r\nEdmonds as captain. Figures show that the militia of Newburgh was not\r\nsleeping during the Revolution, for in 1776 they were called out on\r\nalarms twenty-seven days, and between that time and April, 1788,\r\n305 days. Newburgh was made a general rendezvous for troops, and\r\nfrequently the soldiers were billeted on the inhabitants. Although\r\nthe precinct escaped direct devastation, many of the men were killed\r\nor taken prisoners in defense of the Highland forts.\r\n\r\nWhen the British sailed up the river in 1777, and burnt Kingston,\r\nafter capturing the Highland forts, the Newburgh women hid their\r\nvaluables in the woods, nearly all the men having gone to the defense\r\nof the forts.\r\n\r\nWhile Washington's headquarters were at New Windsor his main army was\r\nin and near the Hudson River forts, and in 1782, after the surrender\r\nof Yorktown, was again encamped along the Hudson, numbering about\r\n8,000 men. Washington at Newburgh, meanwhile, during the progress of\r\npeace negotiations, kept careful watch of Sir Henry Clinton's\r\nmovements. Many interesting stories have been told about Washington\r\nduring his long stay at New Windsor and Newburgh. At Newburgh he\r\nbattled with discontent, and even mutiny, in the army, and here he\r\nproclaimed the cessation of hostilities. This was on April 19, 1783,\r\neight years after the beginning of the war, when general rejoicing\r\nfollowed. The first battalion marched southward June 5th, and the\r\nlast June 23d. On July 12th Washington went up the Hudson to Albany,\r\nwhere he was joined by Governor Clinton and a small party. On August\r\n17th he issued the last general orders from army headquarters,\r\nannouncing his intention to depart and meet Congress at Princeton,\r\nand left West Point the next day. July 4, 1850, the ancient house\r\nthat had been his headquarters in Newburgh was dedicated as a\r\nmonument of the events of the war. General Winfield Scott was present\r\nto raise the flag, and Judge Monell made an address. The building is\r\nowned by the State and controlled by trustees appointed by the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the war the Newburgh people were almost\r\npoverty-stricken. Their Continental money was almost worthless; they\r\nlacked means for the cultivation of their lands, and business was at\r\na standstill. In 1785 they petitioned the Legislature for relief,\r\ngiving as reasons the supplies they had provided for the war, their\r\nmany losses caused by the war, their large personal service, and the\r\ndepreciation of the paper currency, all of which rendered it\r\nimpossible for them to cultivate their farms or pay their just debts,\r\nwhile many families were reduced to want for the necessities of life.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, the vigorous population recuperated, was increased by\r\nnewcomers, and the period of prolonged prosperity began in earnest.\r\nFrom the position of the lowest in 1780 the precinct passed to the\r\nfourth in 1790, with a population of 2,365, and in a quarter of a\r\ncentury to the first rank in population.\r\n\r\nLATER EARLY DAYS.\r\n\r\nThe charter of 1752 of the Glebe was complied with down to 1793. From\r\n1793 to 1815 there was only a temporary church organization, and no\r\nregular minister. Then a legislative enactment was obtained dividing\r\nthe income from the Glebe between the Newburgh Academy and such other\r\nschools as existed or might exist in the territory. It is remarkable\r\nthat the early academy instituted by the Glebe served the community\r\neducationally for nearly a century.\r\n\r\nThe \"old town,\" situated on a plot opened by Cadwallader Colden\r\nbefore 1730, was located between present Front street and Broadway,\r\nand named Newburgh. This was extended by Benjamin Smith in 1782, who\r\nlaid out streets and lots from a part of his farm lying east of\r\nMontgomery street and between First and South streets. After the\r\ndisbandment of the army in 1783 Newburgh's population increased\r\nsomewhat rapidly by the settlement there of some of the soldiers of\r\nthe dissolved army and of families who had fled from New York City\r\nwhen it was captured by the British. But up to 1790 it was a\r\ndisjointed settlement, the three township plots of which it was\r\ncomposed having no connection except through Liberty street and a few\r\ncross-lot roads. None of the lateral streets intersected each other,\r\nand in 1790 other highway commissioners formally connected them. The\r\ngeneral legislative act of 1788 changed the name \"precinct\" to\r\n\"town.\"\r\n\r\nNewburgh quickly became the first shipping point of importance on the\r\nwest bank of the Hudson north of New York, because of its fine\r\nharbor, and of being the natural outlet for the trade of a vast\r\nsection of country previous to the advent of the canals and\r\nrailroads. South of the Highlands the Palisades and other mountain\r\nranges were a barrier to easy access to the river. Therefore in the\r\nearly days transportation became the most important business of\r\nNewburgh. The lumber business was especially heavy, and large\r\nquantities of ship timber, planks and staves were forwarded to New\r\nYork. Shipbuilding was also carried on, and Newburgh ships entered\r\ninto the Liverpool and West Indies trade. Ruttenber mentions many\r\nmills that were erected in Newburgh and vicinity after the war, and\r\nsays: \"Besides mills and hamlets there were many well-cultivated\r\nfarms, and substantial dwellings which had supplanted rude log\r\ncabins.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samuel Grimes]\r\n\r\nThe early millers and boatmen of Newburgh kept goods of various kinds\r\nto sell to the farmers. The first regular store was opened by\r\nBenjamin and David Birdsall, and the second, immediately after the\r\nRevolution, by John McAuley. Hugh Walsh opened a store about the\r\nsame time. The other principal merchants up to 1801 were Wm. Seymour,\r\nLeonard Carpenter, John Anderson, Cooper & Son, George Gardner, James\r\nHamilton, James Burns, Robert Gourley, Robert Gardiner, George\r\nMonell, Robert W. Jones, Denniston & Abercrombie, Wm. W. Sackett,\r\nAlexander Falls, John Shaw and John Brown. A considerable number of\r\nthese were connected with the forwarding business, among them John\r\nAnderson, John Anderson, Jr., Hugh Walsh, Benjamin Case, Jr., Jacob\r\nand Thomas Powell, Jacob and Leonard Carpenter and George Gardner.\r\nTrade on the river was conducted by sloops until 1830, when the first\r\nsteamer, the _Baltimore,_ was purchased and started on regular trips\r\nby Christopher Reeve.\r\n\r\nBefore the war Great Britain would not allow the colonists to engage\r\nin much manufacturing, requiring them to import or supply themselves\r\nby domestic substitutes. Therefore, there was much spinning and\r\nweaving by wives and daughters, and making soap from refuse fats, and\r\ndipping for candles, while the farmer made his own sleds and carts\r\nand generally constructed his own dwelling and outhouses. These\r\npractices were continued to some extent long after the war for\r\neconomical reasons.\r\n\r\nSome of the first men to start things in Newburgh are here named:\r\n\r\nJohn Haines, hat manufacturer, 1795; Richard and Joseph Albertson,\r\nshoe making, before the Revolution; Cooper, tailor, at the close of\r\nthe war; Joseph Reeves, watchmaker, 1798, took up whip-making in\r\n1804, and was followed in watch-making by George Gorden and Ebenezer\r\nAyres; Hugh Spier, cabinet-maker and undertaker, 1798; Selah Reeve,\r\nearthenware manufacturer, 1799; James Patterson, tin plate worker and\r\ncoppersmith, 1797; Mrs. DeGrove, baking, 1791, and succeeded by John\r\nand Joseph Hoffman; Peter Bannen, soap and candle making, 1804,\r\npreceded by Abel Belknap; Matthew DuBois, tobacconist, 1799; James\r\nRenwick distiller, 1790; John Cooper, father of the famous Peter\r\nCooper, ale brewer, 1794; Benjamin Roe, saddle and harness maker,\r\nbefore 1800; Phineas Howell, tanner, before 1800; Sylvester Roe,\r\npainting and glazing, 1804; Henry B. Carpenter, iron and brass\r\nfoundry, 1821; Richard B. Phillips, brush manufacturer, 1831,\r\npreceded by Daniel Berrian; Henry B. Ames, fancy and family soaps,\r\n1852; stock company, with Hiram Bennett, president, cotton goods\r\nmanufactory, 1844; George Gardner, Jason Rogers, William Seymour,\r\nRichard Hill, earliest ship builders, and Walter Burling, Daniel\r\nBailey, Wm. Holmes, Samuel Wright, earliest ship carpenters; Drs.\r\nIsaac Brown and Robert Morrison, regular physicians in 1776; Phineas\r\nBowman, first lawyer, settled in Newburgh at close of Revolution, and\r\nhis contemporary lawyers were Thomas Cooper, Solomon Slight and\r\nJonathan Fisk; Lucius Carey; first newspaper, Newburgh _Packet,_\r\n1775, bought by David Denniston, and name changed to _Mirror;_ E. W.\r\nGray, first daily, _News,_ 1856; Hezekiah Watkins, schoolmaster,\r\n1752; John Nathan, teacher during Revolution and founder of\r\n\"Hutchin's Family Almanac\"; Rev. Jonathan Freeman and Sylvanus\r\nHaight, private school, 1801.\r\n\r\nWhen the second war with England came, Newburgh was paying nearly\r\none-fourth of the taxes of the county. Again she was prominent in\r\nzeal for the national cause. A convention was held in which it was\r\nresolved to resist \"the attacks of domestic enemies and the insolent\r\naggressions of foreign powers.\" Local military companies were ordered\r\non duty at Staten Island, and later Newburgh was made temporarily the\r\nrendezvous for grenadiers, light infantry and riflemen of the 34th\r\nBrigade. Its citizens celebrated Perry's victory on Lake Erie with\r\nenthusiasm. The embargo act detained Newburgh vessels, among others,\r\nin foreign ports, and Newburgh merchantmen were captured and confined\r\nin Dartmour prison.\r\n\r\nColden's first dock was built in 1730. Isaac Belknap sailed a sloop\r\nfrom Newburgh before the Revolution which made trips to the West\r\nIndies. William Harding, Richard Buckingham and Lewis Clark also\r\nsailed sloops before the war, and later conveyed troops on them for\r\nthe Revolutionists. As early as 1798 there were four lines of sloops\r\nfrom Newburgh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arthur Young.]\r\n\r\nIn the thirties Newburgh's river and land trade was very large. The\r\nstreets were frequently blocked for hours with farmers' loaded\r\nwagons. The completion of the Erie canal diverted the most of this\r\ntrade, and later the Delaware and Hudson canal cut off another source\r\nof wealth. Then the construction of the Erie Railroad from Goshen to\r\nPiermont, and its subsequent extension in other directions, finished\r\nthe old transportation business of Newburgh, and it has taken many\r\nyears to bring about the present prosperity, with railroads extending\r\nfrom many directions, large and varied manufactures, superior public\r\ninstitutions and other conditions to correspond.\r\n\r\nAFTER INCORPORATION.\r\n\r\nThe village of Newburgh was incorporated March 25, 1800, by an Act of\r\nthe Legislature, and in May seven trustees, three assessors, three\r\nfire wardens, a collector and a treasurer, were elected. John\r\nAnderson was chosen president of the board of trustees. In 1801, the\r\nNewburgh and Colchester turnpike was incorporated, with a capital of\r\n$125,000. \"Both measures,\" says Ruttenber, \"were largely instrumental\r\nin influencing the prosperity of the village.\" The latter, by\r\nopening a new route of travel westward, brought a trade which in the\r\nmain had previously reached the Hudson by way of New Windsor, as up\r\nto that time nearly all the wagon roads led to this place. The\r\nturnpike so reversed conditions, by giving to the western part of\r\nOrange County and Sullivan County a better and shorter route of\r\ntravel, that Newburgh came up and New Windsor went down, and the\r\nmerchants of the latter place moved their stocks of goods to\r\nNewburgh. Other turnpikes followed, and the village grew rapidly.\r\nFrom the close of the Revolutionary War to 1825 its population\r\nincreased 1,100 in each decade, and its commerce was proportionately\r\nextended. Connecting turnpikes stretched to Canandaigua Lake, and\r\nwere traversed by lines of stages, and a steamer on Cayuga Lake\r\nfacilitated travel. Subsequently connections with Buffalo permitted\r\na trip of sixty-five hours between that place and New York, and this\r\nwas advertised as \"the shortest and most expeditious route from the\r\nHudson River to the western country.\"\r\n\r\nINTERESTING PUBLIC EVENTS.\r\n\r\nThe city of Newburgh was incorporated in 1865. Of its patriotic\r\ncelebrations two were of surpassing enthusiasm and interest. These\r\nwere the Centennial celebration of 1876 and the Centennial\r\ncelebrating the close of the Revolutionary War, of October 18, 1883.\r\nIn the former there was a great nocturnal parade, and the noise and\r\ncommotion were unprecedented in Newburgh from cannon firing, engine\r\nwhistling, fireworks, band playing, songs and shouts. At Washington's\r\nheadquarters the procession paused awhile and sang, \"My Country 'tis\r\nof Thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebration of 1883 was less noisy, but more imposing. The\r\nmemorial monument or \"Tower of Victory,\" at Washington's\r\nheadquarters, had been completed at a cost of $67,000, and the event\r\nwas of national and State as well as local significance. Congress had\r\nappropriated $25,000, the State Legislature $15,000, the Common\r\nCouncil of Newburgh $7,500, and the citizens of Newburgh had\r\nsubscribed $5,000. Many thousands of people came from far and near on\r\nrailroads, steamboats and wagons. The river front was lined with\r\nsteamers. The procession of the military, firemen, and societies was\r\nthree miles long, and included quite forty brass bands and a score of\r\ndrum corps. It was headed by a company of New York City police, and\r\nwithin it rode Peter Ward, mayor of Newburgh; Joel T. Headley,\r\npresident of the Washington Headquarters Commission; Thomas Bayard,\r\npresident of the day; William M. Evarts, orator, and William Bruce,\r\npoet. The inscription on the monument gives the sufficient reason for\r\nthe parade and accompanying ceremonies:\r\n\r\n\"This monument was erected under the authority of the Congress of the\r\nUnited States and the State of New York, in commemoration of the\r\ndisbandment under proclamation of the Continental Congress of October\r\n18, 1783, of the armies by whose patriotic and military virtue our\r\nnational independence and sovereignty were established.\"\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy celebration was the unveiling of the statute of\r\nGeneral George Clinton, October 6, 1896. The exercises consisted of a\r\nmilitary and civic parade. The presentation address was delivered by\r\nRev. William K. Hall, D.D. and Mayor Odell, in behalf of the city,\r\nmade the address of acceptance. The statue stands in Clinton Gore, at\r\nthe junction of Water and Colden Streets. It shows General Clinton\r\nresting on his sword, which he holds in his right hand. It was\r\nmodeled by the late eminent sculptor, Henry K. Brown, and his nephew,\r\nMr. Bush-Brown, had the statue cast and the pedestal carved. The cost\r\nto the people of Newburgh was only $3,000, raised by subscriptions\r\nundertaken by the local Historical Society, and finished by Mayor\r\nOdell. Upon the granite pedestal is this inscription:\r\n\r\n    GEORGE CLINTON\r\n _Member of Continental Congress, 1775-1777. Brigadier-General\r\n Continental Army, 1777. Governor of the State of New York,\r\n 1777-1795, 1801-1804. Vice-President of the United States,\r\n 1804-1812. Cara Patria Carioe Libertas._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George T. Barnes.]\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh Municipal Centennial was fittingly observed May, 1900.\r\nThe parade, in which about twenty-eight hundred persons took part,\r\nmarched through the city's principal thoroughfares, after which the\r\npeople assembled at Washington's Headquarters, and Mayor Wilson\r\ncalled the gathering to order. The Rev. W. K. Hall, D.D., eloquently\r\nreviewed the events of a century in this village and city.\r\nBenediction was pronounced by Rev. Father Salley.\r\n\r\nAnother event of unusual interest was the visit of Lafayette, in\r\n1824, to Newburgh, the place of his headquarters in the Revolution.\r\nHe was given a great reception, Francis Crawford, President of the\r\nvillage, presented him to the corporation in a brief address, and he\r\nwas afterwards received with Masonic honors by Hiram Lodge,\r\nF. & A. M., where he replied eloquently to an address by Rev. Dr.\r\nJohn Brown. He was banqueted at the Crawford Hotel, with about 100\r\ncitizens at the table.\r\n\r\nNewburgh's growth has been steady and healthy in recent years, in\r\nconsequence of civic enterprise and better knowledge of the\r\nadvantages and attractions of her location. Her compact buildings,\r\nmostly of brick, her charming suburbs, with fine country seats, the\r\ngood and delightful roads extending into the country for carriage\r\ndrives and automobiles, her excellent harbor and easy access to the\r\nMetropolis by rail and steamer, her good schools and churches and her\r\nbusy manufactories, are enticements which are drawing many new\r\nresidents. Apart from its population it is the center of trade for\r\nmany thousands of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\nThe following is a partial list of leading industries:\r\n\r\nNewburgh Bleachery, bleachers and finishers of fine cotton fabrics;\r\nSweet, Orr & Co., overalls and working-men's garments; Coldwell Lawn\r\nMower Co.; Coldwell-Wilcox Co., iron founders and machinists; T. S.\r\nMarvel & Co., iron shipbuilding and engineering works; Newburgh Steam\r\nBoiler Works; Fabrikoid Company, imitation leathers; Newburgh Ice\r\nMachine and Engine Co.; Newburgh Lumber Co.; Newburgh Planing Mill\r\nCo.; Belknap & McCann, soap; Lackey Manufacturing Co., lace curtains;\r\nHarrison & Gore Silk Co.; Hudson River Woolen Mills; Staples &\r\nHanford, wire goods; Newburgh Reed Co., reed chairs; Stroock Plush\r\nCo.; Stroock Felt Co.; Little Falls Paper Co.; Granite City Soap Co.;\r\nNewburgh Steam Mills, cotton goods; John Turl's Sons, iron works;\r\nCleveland & Whitehill, overalls; Ferry, Weber & Co., hats; Abendroth\r\n& Root, spiral pipe, etc., automobiles; Muchattoes Lake Ice Co.;\r\nHigginson Manufacturing Co., cement; Newburgh Light, Heat & Power\r\nCo.; Pennsylvania Coal Co.\r\n\r\nOf the industries which have been listed, some should be more fully\r\nnoticed. The Newburgh Ice Machine and Engine Company was known at the\r\ntime of its establishment, in 1824, as the Newburgh Steam Engine\r\nWorks. The present company was organized in 1890 with a capital of\r\n$500,000 to manufacture Whitehill-Corliss engines and ice-making and\r\nrefrigerating machines. Extensive shops were completed that year, to\r\nwhich additions have recently been made. Mr. Edgar Penney is\r\nvice-president and general manager.\r\n\r\nThe Muchattoes Lake Ice Company's business was started in the winter\r\nof 1859-1860 by James R. Dickson, and was bought in 1863 by Benjamin\r\nB. Odell, when he organized the company named. The officers are:\r\nB. B. Odell, president; B. B. Odell, Jr., secretary and treasurer;\r\nH. B. Odell, superintendent.\r\n\r\nSweet, Orr & Co. are the pioneers and most extensive manufacturers\r\nin the country of overalls and other working-men's garments. In 1876\r\ntheir weekly product was about a thousand dozen pairs at their\r\nWappinger's Falls factory, where they kept 250 employees busy.\r\nSeeking increased quarters they started another factory in Newburgh\r\nin 1880. The factory has a frontage of 150 feet on Broadway and 275\r\nfeet on Concord street. In 1882 they opened a factory in Chicago, and\r\nin 1900 another at Joliet, Ill. Sixty traveling salesmen cover the\r\nentire United States with their product. Mr. Clayton E. Sweet, head\r\nof this concern, resides in Newburgh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wesley Wait]\r\n\r\nTo Captain Thomas S. Marvel is due the success of the immense\r\nshipyard of the T. S. Marvel Shipbuilding Company. Soon after the\r\nfailure of Ward, Stanton & Co., Captain Marvel, who had been their\r\nsuperintendent, began business on his own account. The shipyard has\r\nbeen enlarged from time to time, and building after building erected\r\nfor their business. Over 200 men are employed in the building and\r\nrepairing of iron and wooden steamboats and other water craft. Among\r\ntheir notable products are the steamers _Homer Ramsdell,_ _Hendrick\r\nHudson,_ numerous ferryboats, and fire-boats for the New York Fire\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nThe Higginson Manufacturing Company have a very extensive plant for\r\nthe production of plaster, gypsum, etc., with steamers and barges to\r\ntransport it to New York and other points. The business was begun by\r\nWilliam R. Brown in 1868. Mr. Henry C. Higginson has been proprietor\r\nof the plant for many years.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh Bleachery is owned and managed by Joseph Chadwick &\r\nSons. It is one of the largest and best equipped manufactories of its\r\nkind. The Chadwicks in 1871 purchased the present site, and combined\r\nwith it a factory which they owned in Rutherford, N. J.,\r\nconcentrating their whole business in the Newburgh establishment.\r\nThey employ about 300 hands in bleaching and finishing various kinds\r\nof cotton goods.\r\n\r\nThe Fabrikoid Company's industry was moved to Newburgh in 1902. The\r\nplant covers about fifteen acres, and consists of twenty-eight\r\nbuildings. The product is chiefly an imitation leather and the\r\nmanufactory has a capacity of over 6,000 yards a day. Mr. John\r\nAspinwall is president, and Mr. George H. May, secretary and\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nColdwell Lawn Mower Company, manufacturers of hand, horse and motor\r\nlawn mowers, is the largest concern in the world devoted exclusively\r\nto the production of these machines. The firm is composed of William\r\nH. Coldwell, president and general manager; E. C. Ross, treasurer;\r\nH. T. Coldwell, assistant treasurer, and A. W. Mapes, secretary. Mr.\r\nThomas Coldwell, the parent of this industry, organized the company\r\nin 1891, and the plant was built on the most modern principles.\r\nTheir annual output, shipped to all parts of the globe, exceeds one\r\nhundred thousand mowers, which is over one-fifth of the entire\r\nproduction in the country.\r\n\r\nH. Powell Ramsdell, of Newburgh, is the proprietor of the Arlington\r\nPaper Mill at Salisbury's Mills, eight miles southwest of the city on\r\nMurderer's Creek and the Newburgh branch of the Erie. The mill is the\r\nprincipal industrial element of the hamlet. It is picturesquely\r\nsituated on the edge of a rocky gorge. The oldest part of the mill\r\nwas built about 1840, by Isaac K. Oakley. It forms but a small part\r\nof the present plant, the main building of which is 480 feet long and\r\nfrom one to three stories high, with capacity for the employment of\r\n150 hands, and the production of over 24,000 pounds of paper daily.\r\nIt is a progressive institution and up to date in its machinery and\r\nother equipment. There are several detached buildings in addition to\r\na connected series of brick and stone buildings, and twenty or more\r\ncottages for the families of the employees. The Arlington Mill\r\nmanufactures the best grades of book paper and French folios, white\r\nand colored. These go to the great publishing houses of New York and\r\nother American cities, and some of them to England and even to\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nEXTENSIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nWashington Heights, formerly the homestead of Captain Henry\r\nRobinson--a tract of nearly 100 acres in the southern part of the\r\ncity--was made a valuable addition to the resident portion of the\r\ncity by its purchase from the heirs, division into streets and lots\r\nand their improvements started twenty years ago. The part of the\r\nplateau east of Lander street, about forty acres, was purchased by\r\nHenry T. McConn, and he arranged with Colonel Charles H. Weygant for\r\nits development. The macadam streets are broad and straight, the\r\nhouses must set twelve feet back from the sidewalk, which is lined\r\nwith shade trees. A little later, in October, 1887, William D. and\r\nJoseph M. Dickey purchased the part of the Robinson farm west of\r\nLander street, forty-two acres, and there inaugurated similar\r\nimprovements. Many lots have been sold and houses erected on both\r\nplots.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh Street Railway Company obtained a franchise early in\r\n1886 to build a surface road from a point near the western end of the\r\ncity to the Union depot, and then another to extend the line from the\r\ncorner of Water and Third streets along Water street to near the\r\nnortherly line of the city. On December 23d, of the same year, the\r\nroad was formally opened between West Newburgh and the Union depot.\r\nLater the road was extended to Orange Lake, and the name was changed\r\nto the Orange County Traction Company. In 1906 it was purchased by\r\nEx-Governor Odell, and desirable improvements in equipment were made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. C. Barnes]\r\n\r\nOn recommendation of Mayor Odell, in his annual message of 1887, the\r\npeople voted $30,000 for the purchase of additional lands to the\r\nformer Smith estate, owned by the city, to be improved and laid out\r\ninto the beautiful and sightly Downing Park, in honor of Andrew J.\r\nDowning.\r\n\r\nOf buildings for public use the Newburgh Academy of Music is\r\nconspicuous. It was projected in 1886 by J. P. Andrews and E. S.\r\nTurner, and the construction was commenced in the spring of 1887.\r\nIt has a frontage on Broadway of 85 feet and a depth of 140 feet. The\r\nauditorium is 80 feet long by 45 feet deep, 40 feet high, and will\r\nseat 1,300 people. The stage is 80 by 35 feet, and there are 12\r\ndressing rooms, 2 balconies and 4 boxes. In all its appointments it\r\nis thoroughly modern.\r\n\r\nOf school buildings two deserve particular notice. The Free Academy\r\nwas erected in 1885-1886, and cost $67,000. The material is brick\r\nwith stone trimmings. It is 112 by 68 feet, and three stories high,\r\nwith basement. It has an assembly room 88 by 64 feet, which will seat\r\n700 persons, and 12 class rooms each 31 by 23 feet. There are 21\r\nrooms in all. Without and within it is a good specimen of school\r\narchitecture. Another is the Grammar School building, erected in 1891\r\nat a cost of $30,000. This is 74 by 76 feet, with eight class rooms\r\n28 by 23 feet each, and each containing desks for 40 pupils. The\r\nassembly room is in the third story.\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy building is that of the Y. M. C. A., constructed\r\nin 1882-1883, and costing $24,000. It is 31 by 77 feet, three stories\r\nhigh, and has a seating capacity in its assembly room for 300\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIn 1896-1897 a handsome Government building was erected. Congress\r\nhaving appropriated $100,000 for this purpose, and this has since\r\nbeen the home of the post-office, the business of which has already\r\nalmost outgrown it.\r\n\r\nThe water with which Newburgh is supplied is drawn from Washington\r\nLake, three and a third miles from the Hudson and 276 feet above it.\r\nThe lake is fed by internal springs and an artificial channel with\r\nSilver stream. Chemical analysis has shown that this water is so pure\r\nthat it needs no filtering, and it is agreeably palatable, without\r\nany mineral flavors. It has been healthy Newburgh's drinking water\r\nfor more than fifty years. The lake's area is about 140 acres, and it\r\nhas a storage capacity of 300,000,000 gallons. Newburgh is now so\r\nthoroughly piped that the water is universally accessible to its\r\ncitizens, and is an invaluable protection against fire as well as\r\npromoter of cleanliness, health and happiness.\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AND EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nNewburgh has been remarkably free from crime, which is in part due to\r\nthe character of its citizens and in part to its uniformly excellent\r\npolice force, which now consists of one marshal, two sergeants, two\r\nroundsmen and fifteen patrolmen.\r\n\r\nThe Volunteer Fire Department of Newburgh is one of the oldest in the\r\nState, and also one of the most efficient. Therefore there have been\r\nfew very damaging fires, and the insurance rates are low. From its\r\norganization, over a hundred years ago, until now, it has had on its\r\nrecords of membership some of the leading business and professional\r\nmen in the community, and they have promptly responded to the call\r\nfor service when their service was required.\r\n\r\nThe department was started, by authority of an act of Legislature, in\r\nthe spring of 1797. This was three years before the village was\r\nincorporated, and the five trustees which the act required to be\r\nelected annually for controlling managers were the first form of\r\ngovernment in the village. Their power was transferred to the village\r\ntrustees by the incorporating act. There were at first a suction\r\nengine and a bucket brigade to keep it supplied with water. In 1805\r\na company of \"bagmen\" was formed, whose duty it was to take charge of\r\ngoods. The first engine house was erected about the same time, and a\r\nrecord of the two engine companies of 1806 furnishes the following\r\nnames:\r\n\r\nNo. 1--William I. Smith, Enoch E. Tilton, Walter Burling, Henry\r\nTudor, Ward M. Gazlay, Gilbert N. Clement, Minard Harris, John\r\nCarskaden, Caleb Sutton, George E. Hulse, John Coleman, John\r\nHoagland, William Adee, Andrew Preston, Nicholas Wright, John\r\nForsyth, Walter Case.\r\n\r\nNo. 2--John Harris, Jonathan Fisk, John Anderson, Jr., Leonard\r\nCarpenter, Selah Reeve, James Hamilton, Samuel I. Gregory, William\r\nGardiner, Nathaniel Burling, Solomon Sleight, Jonathan Carter, Hiram\r\nWeller, Samuel Wright, Hugh Spier, Thomas Powell, Cornelius De Witt,\r\nJoseph Hoffman. Cadwallader Roe, Daniel Niven, Jr., Benoni H. Howell,\r\nSylvanus Jessup, Joseph Reeve, John Richardson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Dales.]\r\n\r\nThe interesting history of the department from its interesting\r\nbeginnings cannot be followed here. Coming down to the present time\r\nits heads consist of a chief engineer and two assistant engineers,\r\nthe foreman and assistant foreman of the various companies, and the\r\ntrustees of the Fire Department fund. The names of the companies are:\r\nHighland Steamer Co. No. 3, Washington Steamer Co. No. 4, Brewster\r\nHook and Ladder Co. No. 1, Ringgold Hose Co. No. 1, Columbian Hose\r\nCo. No. 2, C. M. Leonard Steamer Co. No. 2, Chapman Steamer Co. No.\r\n1, Lawson Hose Co. No. 5, Washington Heights Chemical Engine Co. No.\r\n3.\r\n\r\nThe city is divided into five fire districts, and thirty-two alarm\r\nboxes connect with the engine houses.\r\n\r\nNewburgh is essentially progressive and modern in its educational\r\nsystem, now made free, from the primary to the end of the academic\r\ncourse. Its Board of Education consists of nine members. It has seven\r\npublic school buildings and one public library building. Other\r\nofficers besides the board, are its president, vice-president, clerk,\r\nwho is also superintendent, librarian, counsel and attendance\r\nofficer. There are also three Glebe trustees and three Glebe\r\nauditors. The courses of study are similar to those in other city\r\nschools, and the graduate from the Free Academy may be prepared to\r\nenter one of the leading colleges, while the Manual Training School\r\nis a physical safeguard as well as a means for harmonious muscular\r\ndevelopment. For reading helps apart from text-books the good library\r\nof nearly 35,000 volumes is an opening into general literature.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the Glebe trustees and auditors referred to dates back\r\nto ancient conditions which have been mentioned. The act to amend the\r\ncharter of the Glebe passed by the Legislature in 1803, directed that\r\n$200 should be paid annually to the trustees of the academy, and that\r\nthe remainder of the money from the Glebe income should be paid to\r\nthe other schools on the Glebe lands, as the inhabitants should\r\ndirect. It was applied to the juvenile school which was established\r\nin the old Lutheran church in 1803, the last teacher of which was\r\nJohn L. Lyon, who taught from 1843 to 1845, when the school was\r\nremoved to the academy. In 1849, after the Clinton street school\r\nbuilding was erected and became officially known as the Glebe school,\r\nit received the revenues of the Glebe above the sum required by law\r\nto be paid to the academy. The High school was incorporated in 1829,\r\nand opened the next year. The number of pupils registered in this\r\n1851-1852 was 348, and the number in the Glebe school about 120.\r\nDuring the first year of the new order of things, provided for in the\r\nact of 1852, the number of pupils was doubled.\r\n\r\nBesides the present public schools there are several parish and\r\nprivate schools, the former being under the care of the Roman\r\nCatholic Church. Of these St. Mary's Academy, founded in 1883, has\r\nbecome very prominent and useful.\r\n\r\nThe library, with its 35,000 volumes, is free to the people of\r\nNewburgh, and the building includes a teachers' reading room supplied\r\nwith books adapted to the professional needs of the teachers, and may\r\nalso be used by citizens and strangers for study and literary work.\r\nThe library was started in 1852, and is among the oldest of the free\r\ncirculating libraries. Previous to 1850 there were but four in the\r\nState, ten in the New England States, six besides these in the\r\nUnited States, and none in Great Britain, and but one of the\r\nlibraries then organized has as many books or as large a circulation\r\nas the Newburgh library. In September, 1852, the Board of Education\r\nresolved that all the school libraries in the village should be\r\nconsolidated and placed together in the academy room, then ready to\r\nreceive them, and William N. Reid, first principal of the academy\r\nunder the new system, was appointed librarian. There were 924 volumes\r\nfrom the high school, 737 from the Glebe and 418 from the academy. In\r\n1862 the books of the Mechanics' Library Association were transferred\r\nto the Board of Education, which added 2,801 volumes to the library.\r\nOther donations and the purchases have brought the library to its\r\npresent valuable condition in the number and quality of its books.\r\nThe fine building which now contains them was completed in 1877.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\nOf Newburgh's churches the oldest is the _First Presbyterian,_ whose\r\nlegal existence began a few months after the close of the\r\nRevolutionary War, although its informal existence had started a\r\nscore of years before, and been kept up in an irregular and feeble\r\nway. The formal organization as a Presbyterian society under the laws\r\nof the Slate took place July 12, 1884, with these trustees: Adolph\r\nDegrove, Daniel Hudson, Thomas Palmer, Joseph Coleman, Isaac Belknap.\r\nThe first stated supply was Rev. John Close, who served from 1785 to\r\n1796. His successor was Rev. Isaac Lewis, who continued until 1800\r\nand was followed by Rev. John Freeman, and Mr. Freeman by Rev.\r\nEleazer Burnet. Then came the long and very successful pastorate of\r\nRev. John Johnston, which lasted from July 5, 1807, until his death,\r\nAugust 23, 1855. Nearly a thousand members were added to the church\r\nroll during his ministry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas Coldwell.]\r\n\r\nThe congregation of the _First Associate Reformed Church_ was formed\r\nin 1798, and the society was legally incorporated February 7, 1803.\r\nThe first pastor, Rev. Robert Kerr, was installed April 6, 1799. The\r\nfirst trustees were: Derick Amerman, Hugh Walsh, Daniel Niven, Robert\r\nGourley, Robert Boyd, John Brown, Isaac Belknap, Jr., John Coulter\r\nand Robert W. Jones. The ruling elders were John Currie, Samuel\r\nBelknap, Hugh Speir and John Shaw.\r\n\r\n_The First Reformed Presbyterian Church_ was planted in Newburgh\r\nby several families of the Covenanter faith in 1793, who held\r\nservices in their homes on Sundays, and, with others, organized a\r\nCovenanter society in 1802. This became a branch of the Coldenham\r\ncongregation, and the connection was continued until 1824, when it\r\nseparated, and James Clark, Samuel Wright and John Lawson were\r\nchosen elders and John Crawford, deacon.\r\n\r\n_Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church_ was organized in 1808, when Rev.\r\nSamuel Fowler became the first pastor.\r\n\r\n_St. George's Episcopal Church_ has been elsewhere referred to in the\r\nearly history of Newburgh. The parish was reincorporated, after a\r\nlong period of adversity, in 1805, and the minister who more than any\r\none else built it up afterward in the early years of the nineteenth\r\ncentury was Rev. John Brown. He became its regular rector in the fall\r\nof 1815.\r\n\r\n_The African M. E. Church_ was organized in 1827, by Rev. George\r\nMatthews.\r\n\r\nA Baptist Church was organized in 1821, and after a feeble existence,\r\nending in dissolution in 1828, was formally reorganized in December,\r\n1834.\r\n\r\nOf the later churches the organizations were as follows:\r\n\r\n_American Reformed Church,_ September 24, 1835; _St. Patrick's Roman\r\nCatholic Church,_ 1838; _Union Church,_ July 13, 1837; _Shiloh\r\nBaptist Church,_ 1848; _St. John's M. E. Church,_ May 23, 1852;\r\n_Westminstcr Reformed Presbyterian Church,_ November 12, 1854;\r\n_Calvary Presbyterian Church,_ September 1, 1856; _First United\r\nPresbyterian Church,_ December 6, 1859; _Congregation Beth Jacob,_\r\nabout 1860; _St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal Church,_ May, 1860;\r\n_Grace M. E. Church,_ April 25, 1868; _Church of our Father_\r\n(Unitarian), 1855; _St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church,_ May 19, 1875;\r\n_Church of the Corner Stone_ (Reformed Episcopal), December 2, 1873;\r\n_German Evangelical Lutheran Church,_ spring of 1876; _Church of the\r\nGood Shepard_ (Episcopal), June, 1871; _First Congregational Church,_\r\nJanuary 3, 1889.\r\n\r\nOTHER HELPFUL ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nA Young Men's Christian Association of Newburgh was organized\r\nSeptember 17, 1858, and the next week officers were elected. The time\r\nof organization was less than six years after the Y. M. C. A.\r\nmovement started. The association dissolved about 1861, and after the\r\nlapse of seven years the present association was organized. It did\r\nnot have a vigorous existence for several years, and was reorganized\r\nin January, 1879. A few months later General Secretary J. T. Browne\r\ncame to Newburgh and put new life into it, and it has been prosperous\r\nand progressive since. Its president, E. S. Tanner, was largely\r\ninstrumental in raising the money for the new building, first\r\noccupied in 1883, and costing $17,000.\r\n\r\nAt a public meeting held April 24, 1888, after an address by the\r\nnational secretary, Miss Nettie Dunn, Newburgh's Young Women's\r\nChristian Association was organized, and 105 members enrolled. The\r\nelected officers were: President, Mrs. Susan McMasters;\r\nvice-presidents, Mrs. Isaac Garrison, Miss Mary E. Gouldy and Mrs.\r\nCharles S. Jenkins; recording secretary, Miss Augusta Lester;\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. M. C. Belknap. The association has been prosperous\r\nand useful.\r\n\r\nSt. Luke's Home and Hospital was incorporated in 1876. Its object is\r\nto provide for the care and medical treatment of the sick and\r\ndisabled, and also a home for aged women. It has a training school\r\nfor nurses, established in 1893, and a medical board of nearly a\r\nscore of physicians and specialists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Valentine Kohl.]\r\n\r\nThere are two institutions under the care of Alms House\r\nCommissioners--the City and Town Home and Children's Home. The\r\nformer is on a farm in the southwestern corner of the city, and the\r\nlatter is a building in High Street. These are city benefactions,\r\nwell managed and helpful to the aged and orphaned.\r\n\r\nAn office and employment bureau was organized in 1875, and\r\nreorganized in 1886. It is primarily an organization to help the poor\r\nto help themselves. Members pay $5 annually and agree to abstain from\r\nindiscriminate alms giving. The society is otherwise supported by\r\nvoluntary contributions.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Young Women's Christian\r\nTemperance Union labor to teach the boys and younger men the\r\nprinciples of temperance and morality, and have restrained and\r\nreformed many of them.\r\n\r\nThere are two military companies in Newburgh--the Fifth Separate and\r\nTenth Separate Companies, originating in the Seventeenth Battalion,\r\nwhich was organized in 1878. Lieutenant Colonel E. D. Hayt,\r\ncommanding. January 11, 1882, Companies B, C and D were mustered out\r\nand Company A, Captain James T. Chase, continued as Fifth Separate\r\nCompany, and Company E, Captain James M. Dickey, continued as Tenth\r\nSeparate Company.\r\n\r\nThe Lodges of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows are Acme No. 469;\r\nBismarck No. 420; Highland No. 65 and Mount Olive Encampment No. 65.\r\n\r\nThe Elks have Lodge No. 247, B. P. O. E.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Army of the Republic is represented in Newburgh by Ellis\r\nPost No. 52. and Fullerton Post No. 589. The Sons of Veterans have\r\nA. S. Cassedy Post No. 18.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Pythias have Storm King Lodge No. 11, Olive Branch\r\nLodge No. 133, Endowment Rank Section No. 206 and Charles T. Goodrich\r\nDivision No. 25, Uniform Rank.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Honor have Hudson River Lodge No. 1218.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Order of Foresters has Court Newburgh No. 7256 and Court\r\nPride of the Hudson No. 7718.\r\n\r\nThe Improved Order of Red Men has Muchattoes Tribe No. 54, and Orange\r\nCouncil No. 50, Degree of Pocahontas.\r\n\r\nOf temperance societies there are Orange Council No. 186, Royal\r\nTemplars of Temperance, Prohibition Alliance; Junior Prohibition\r\nClub, St. George's Company No. 62, Knights of Temperance, St. Paul's\r\nCompany No. 62. Mission Lodge No. 639 I. O. of G. T., Newburgh Lodge\r\nNo. 282 I. O. of G. T., and Victory Lodge I. O. of G. T.\r\n\r\nAmong the many other societies are United Friends, Sons of St.\r\nGeorge, Ancient Order of Hibernians, Royal Arcanum, Order of United\r\nAmerican Mechanics, Sexennial League, Knights and Ladies of the\r\nGolden Star, Knights of Honor, Orange Men, several Catholic\r\nsocieties, labor and trade unions, Newburgh Bible Society,\r\nHistorical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands, Society for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals, Society for Instruction in First\r\nAid to the Injured, and Horse Thief Detecting Society.\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\nNewburgh has solid financial institutions. Highland Bank was\r\nchartered April 26, 1834, with a capital of $200,000. In January,\r\n1865, the capital was increased to $350,000, and the following April\r\nwas reorganized as a National Bank with a capital of $450,000, which\r\nwas reduced to $300,000 in 1888. The first president was Gilbert O.\r\nFowler.\r\n\r\nQuassaick National Bank was organized March 31, 1852, and began\r\nbusiness with a capital of $130,000. The first president was E. W.\r\nFarrington, and the first cashier Jonathan N. Weed. In June of the\r\nyear of organization the capital stock was increased to $200,000, and\r\nin June of 1853 to $300,000. In 1895 Mr. Weed was chosen president.\r\n\r\nThe National Bank of Newburgh is the successor of the Bank of\r\nNewburgh, incorporated March 22, 1811. The capital of the first bank\r\nwas $120,000. The first president was Isaac Belknap, Jr., and the\r\nfirst cashier was John S. Hunn. In February, 1820, a branch bank was\r\nopened at Ithaca and continued till 1830, when its charter expired.\r\nThe Bank of Newburgh was then reorganized under the Safety Fund law\r\nwith a capital of $140,000. In 1851 it was again reorganized under\r\nthe general banking law with a capital of $200,000, which was\r\nincreased the next year to $300,000. July 3, 1864, the bank divided\r\nits capital and 60 per cent, profits among its stockholders, and\r\nclosed business, and two days afterward the National Bank of Newburgh\r\nmore than took its place in the business community, with the large\r\ncapital of $800,000, the stock of which was promptly taken. June 3,\r\n1890, the stockholders voted to reduce the capital to $400,000, and\r\nthe additional $400,000 with 40 per cent profits was divided among\r\nthem. The bank has continued to prosper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jos. H. Wetler]\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh Savings Hank was chartered April 13, 1852, and was\r\nopened January 1, 1853. Its present building was completed in 1868,\r\nand cost $115,527. It has been a helpful institution to the people of\r\nNewburgh and vicinity. Its first president was Robert L. Case.\r\nJoseph Chadwick is now its president.\r\n\r\nThe Columbus Trust Company began to do business March 1, 1893, at No.\r\n82 Broadway, with a capital stock of $100,000 divided among 144\r\nshareholders. Semi-annual dividends of 3 per cent, have been\r\nregularly paid since 1895. In 1901 the directors decided to purchase\r\nNo. 78 Broadway for a banking house. The building was remodeled, and\r\nApril 20, 1902, the company moved to its present quarters. This\r\ncompany has prospered beyond the reasonable expectations of its\r\nfriends. The statement of December 31, 1893, showed $117,249.17 on\r\ndeposit, and $20,238.36 surplus and undivided profits. June 29, 1907,\r\ndeposits amounted to $2,941,587.13 and surplus and undivided profits\r\nto $121,527.26. The total number of accounts is 5,300. The present\r\nofficers are: Joseph Van Cleft, president; David A. Morrison, first\r\nvice-president; Charles K. Bull, second vice-president; Henry M.\r\nLeonard, treasurer; Barclay Van Cleft, secretary; Walter C. Anthony,\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade was organized February 22, 1882, Mayor A. S.\r\nCassedy presiding at the meeting. Daniel S. Waring was chosen\r\npresident and the other officers were: vice-presidents, William B.\r\nBrockaw and John Schoonmaker; treasurer, Jonathan N. Weed. This\r\norganization helped in many ways to advance the city's interests. It\r\nwas succeeded by the Business Men's Association, organized October\r\n16, 1900, with the following officers: Samuel V. Schoonmaker,\r\npresident; James Chadwick, W. C. Belknap, Hiram B. Odell,\r\nvice-presidents; John F. Tucker, secretary: H. A. Bartlett,\r\ntreasurer. It was incorporated March 30, 1904. Among the larger\r\nplants it has secured for Newburgh may be mentioned (1901) the\r\nAbendroth & Root Co., of Brooklyn manufacturers of spiral pipe,\r\nautomobiles, etc.; (1901-1902) the Fabrikoid Co., formerly doing\r\nbusiness in New Jersey, which purchased the property known as Haigh\r\nMills at West Newburgh. Their products are shipped to all parts of\r\nthe world; (1903) William C. Gregg Co., of Minneapolis, Minn.,\r\nmanufacturers of sugar plantation machinery. William Johnston McKay\r\nwas chosen president of the association in 1907. This organization is\r\nin charge of Newburgh's portion of the Ter-Centenary celebration of\r\nthe discovery of the Hudson River, and has already arranged for\r\nspecial exercises, September 25, 26 and 27, 1909.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION AVENUES.\r\n\r\nThe transportation facilities of Newburgh are almost unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nIn front is its fine harbor, bay and river, with steamship lines up\r\nand down and across. These lines are a restraint upon the tendencies\r\nof the railroads towards high freight rates. The river trade is large\r\nand within a few miles of Newburgh are about fifteen village ports\r\nwhich are more or less tributary to it. The local traffic of the\r\nHudson is mostly by lines of steamers, some of which carry both\r\nfreight and passengers and others only passengers. Sloops and\r\nschooners, which long ago did nearly all the carrying trade, still do\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe Central Hudson Steamboat Company has two night lines of steamers\r\nto New York, which carry passengers and freight. Boats of this line\r\nleave Newburgh and New York in the evening and afford charming water\r\ntrips to residents and others. The company also provides the\r\nNewburgh, Albany and Troy line, the steamers of which leave Newburgh\r\nfor the upward trips every morning, except Sundays, and arrive from\r\nAlbany in the evening. The captains of the boats on the Newburgh and\r\nNew York lines are Zach Roosa, William Meakim, Weston L. Dennis and\r\nE. N. Gage. Those on the Newburgh, Albany & Troy line are Fred L.\r\nSimpson and Egbert Van Wagner.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh and Fishkill ferry, for which a line of steamers was\r\nstarted in 1835, continues business, its steamers leaving Newburgh\r\nabout every half hour between 5.45 a. m. and 10.45 p. m.\r\nH. Stockbridge Ramsdell is the agent.\r\n\r\nNewburgh and Haverstraw Steamboat Company has the steamer _Emeline,_\r\nCaptain D. C. Woolsey, which starts for Haverstraw and intermediate\r\nlandings each mid-afternoon and Haverstraw for Newburgh in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nNewburgh and Poughkeepsie line's steamer _Hudson Taylor,_ Captain\r\nGeorge Walker, leaves Newburgh for Poughkeepsie every morning.\r\n\r\nWappinger's Falls and Newburgh line's steamer _Messenger_ leaves\r\nNewburgh forenoons and early evenings.\r\n\r\nThe West Shore Railroad, which extends north and west to Albany and\r\nBuffalo and south to New York, connects at Newburgh with the line and\r\nthe New York and the New England systems, and at Buffalo with the\r\nGrand Trunk and the Lake Shore Railroads. Over thirty trains a day\r\narrive and depart on this road. It has facilities for transporting\r\ncars across the river.\r\n\r\nOne Erie Railroad branch extends to a junction with the main line at\r\nGreycourt, eighteen miles distant, and affords a direct route to the\r\nPennsylvania coal fields and across the southern tier of New York\r\ncounties to the west. Another Erie branch connects with the main line\r\nat Newburgh Junction, fifteen miles distant, and passes through a\r\nnumber of Orange County villages. About twenty passenger trains a day\r\narrive and depart over these branches.\r\n\r\nThe New York Central's Hudson River line of railroad across the river\r\nfrom Newburgh is reached by the ferry, the boats of which make close\r\nconnection with all through passenger trains.\r\n\r\nThe Lehigh and Hudson River Railway extends from a junction with the\r\nNewburgh branch and the Erie's main line at Greycourt to Belvedere.\r\nThe Newburgh branch is operated as a part of the system controlled by\r\nthe Central Railroad of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThere is also the line of the Orange County Traction Company,\r\nextending to Walden.\r\n\r\nNewburgh is the principal gateway for the coal traffic between\r\nPennsylvania fields and the New England States, which consume six\r\nmillion tons of coal annually. The loaded cars on reaching the river\r\nfront are quickly ferried across to Fishkill on the transfer boat,\r\nand the roads coming to Fishkill distribute them. Much coal is also\r\nshipped from Newburgh by water to all parts of the northern country,\r\nand to the ports of Long Island and the New England coast.\r\n\r\nCEMETERIES.\r\n\r\nNewburgh has six cemeteries--the Newburgh, or Old Town, St. George's,\r\nSt. Patrick's, the Hebrew, and in the suburbs, Woodlawn and Cedar\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh has many old headstones, and is in the block where stood\r\nthe church of the old Palatine settlers.\r\n\r\nSt. George's is under the care of St. George's Protestant Episcopal\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick's is for the remains of the Roman Catholic dead and the\r\nHebrew for the Jewish dead.\r\n\r\nWoodlawn Cemetery is controlled by the Newburgh Woodlawn Cemetery\r\nAssociation, which was incorporated October 22, 1870. It is in the\r\ntown of New Windsor, a mile from the city, and is reached by a\r\ndelightful avenue. It is an ideal location for a cemetery, with\r\nextended river and mountain views. Quassaick avenue, leading from the\r\ncity to Woodlawn, is lined with elegant country residences in the\r\nmidst of spacious grounds studded with fine trees and beautified in\r\nthe warm season with wide lawns and varieties of beautiful flowers.\r\nThe cemetery grounds contain fifty acres, laid out with excellent\r\nartistic taste and skill, and carefully looked after and kept in\r\norder by the superintendent, MacLeod Rogers, who has occupied the\r\nposition from the beginning. Some of its features are a row of fine\r\ncedars along the northern boundary, a dense grove on the western\r\nside, scattered ancient oaks, also maples, pines, elms and other\r\nkinds of trees, varieties of shrubs and flowers, and a natural\r\nstream. There are several imposing monuments and many fine designs\r\nin sculptured marble and granite.\r\n\r\nCedar Hill Cemetery is about five miles north of the center of the\r\ncity, and contains 100 acres in the midst of a picturesque landscape.\r\nIt has about three miles of driveways through its park-like grounds,\r\nthere is a stream of spring water which supplies a little lake of two\r\nand one-half acres, and there are many handsome monuments. The Cedar\r\nHill Cemetery Association was organized in 1870.\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\nRegarding enlistments from Newburgh and the money raised for the\r\nCivil War, the recapitulation in Ruttenber and Clark's History is\r\nhere quoted:\r\n\r\n\"1. Company B. 3d Regiment, recruited in March and April, 1861. 2.\r\nCompany B, 36th Regiment, recruited in May and June. 1861. 3. Company\r\nI, 71st Regiment Militia, recruited principally from Company I, 19th\r\nRegiment. 4. Companies A and B., and parts of C, D and G, 56th\r\nRegiment, recruited between July and October, 1861. 5. Seventh\r\nIndependent Battery, in part, recruited with 56th Regiment. 6.\r\nCompanies D, E, F, I and L, 19th Regiment Militia; miscellaneous\r\nenlistments prior to July, 1862, 111. Under the calls of July and\r\nAugust, 1862, 470 men were required from the town, and 501 furnished,\r\n217 of whom were enrolled in the 124th and 106 in the 168th\r\nRegiments. The call of July, 1863 required 443 men, of whom ninety\r\nwere furnished; but it was merged in the calls of October 1863, and\r\nof February, March and July, 1864, requiring 756; number furnished,\r\n827, of whom seventy-one were not credited. The total of enlistments,\r\nincluding re-enlistments, was 2,250; the total of men required,\r\n1,226. The public subscriptions and loans of the town, including at\r\nthat time the village, for the promotion of enlistments and for\r\nbounties were: 1861, by individual subscriptions, $7,385; bonds of\r\nthe village, $5,000; 1862, individual subscriptions, $17,512; 1864,\r\ntown bonds, $175,100; total, $204,997. In addition to this sum the\r\ntown expended for special relief--1863-1864--$1,075.50; expended by\r\naid society, and in contributions to the Christian Commission,\r\n$12,387.31; raising the total to $218,459.81, and the further sum of\r\n$321,320 (partly estimated) for special income and internal revenue\r\ntaxes to January 1, 1865--a grand total of $539.779.81.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James J. Leonard.]\r\n\r\nPOST-OFFICE.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh post-office was the first to be established in this part\r\nof the State, and passed the centennial of its organization in\r\nDecember, 1895. Prior to that date letters and other articles which\r\nnow go by mail were carried by post riders, who delivered and\r\ndeposited letters at appointed stations. The first post-carrier\r\nstation in this district is supposed to have been what was known as\r\n\"the glass house\" in the ancient village of New Windsor, where\r\nletters were addressed as early as 1755. One of the early stations\r\nwas the tavern of Michael Wiegand on present Liberty street, and the\r\nregular accounting post-office of 1895 was its successor. At that\r\ntime, we are told, the Newburgh office included in its deliveries\r\nMarlborough, Montgomery, Plattekill, New Windsor and other nearby\r\nsettlements, and received mails by carriers on the established post\r\nroads, the main trunk lines being the old King's Highway, now Liberty\r\nstreet, the old road from Kingston to Goshen, running through\r\nMontgomery, from which a cross mail was carried through Coldenham to\r\nNewburgh, and there was a main cross mail running east through\r\nFishkill into New England and to Boston, which intersected a cross\r\nline on the east side of the river extending from New York to Albany.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh post-office had various locations in town until 1897,\r\nwhen it was moved into its permanent home in the new Government\r\nbuilding, then just completed. The equipment here was modern and\r\ncomplete and the space sufficient, but the rapid growth of the city's\r\nindustrial business and other changing conditions have been such that\r\nthe building is already too small for the increased and increasing\r\npost-office business. Note the changes in five years. On March 1,\r\n1900, there were connected with the office eight clerks, thirteen\r\nletter carriers and one substitute carrier, and in 1905 there were\r\nthirteen clerks, two substitute clerks, sixteen carriers, four\r\nsubstitute carriers, and four rural delivery carriers. The receipts\r\nof the office for the year ending March 31, 1901, were $52,263.12,\r\nand for the year ending March 31, 1906, they were $73,232.79, an\r\nincrease of $20,969.37. or 40.12 per cent.\r\n\r\nA list of postmasters from the beginning until now, with the dates of\r\ntheir appointment, follows:\r\n\r\nEbenezer Foote, appointed January 1, 1796; Harry Caldwell, October 1,\r\n1797; Daniel Birdsall, October 1, 1802; Chester Clark, July 1, 1810;\r\nAaron Belknap, March 26, 1812; Tooker Wygant, November 26, 1830;\r\nA.

A. Gorse.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF NEW WINDSOR.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. C. A. Gorse.\r\n\r\nLess than three centuries ago, to be accurate in 1609, Hendrick\r\nHudson sailed up the beautiful river to which he gave his name, and\r\nanchored in the broad bay above the Highlands to trade with the\r\naboriginal inhabitants, who then inhabited the primeval forests which\r\nlined its banks.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that he and some portion of his crew were the first\r\nmen who set foot upon the virgin soil of New Windsor, but it was not\r\nuntil more than half a century later, in 1685, that a company of\r\nScotch and Irish emigrants to the number of twenty-five families,\r\nwith their servants, under the leadership of Colonel Patrick\r\nMcGregorie, accompanied by his sons-in-law, David Foshack and\r\nCaptain Evens, settled upon the extreme eastern extremity of the\r\ntown, now known as Plum Point, an elevation of 118 feet above the\r\nriver and consisting of eighty acres at the mouth of the Moodna\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nHere they erected a commodious cabin and established a trading post;\r\nthis is the earliest recorded settlement in the county. Colonel\r\nMcGregorie was appointed muster general of the militia of the\r\nprovince and after his death, in 1691, in an endeavor to suppress an\r\ninsurrection by the Leister party, his sons-in-law and their families\r\ncontinued to reside here until 1789. The patent which the Colonel\r\nobtained to the land passed into the possession of his son, Patrick\r\nMcGregorie, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe town is wedge-shaped, its sharp edge of about five miles in\r\nextent resting upon the river. There is but a small extent of\r\ncomparatively level land along the river bank upon which the village\r\nof New Windsor stands, back of which there rises a steep bluff with a\r\nsurface of sand and gravel, and a substratum of clay, which is used\r\nin the manufacture of an excellent quality of brick, which at the\r\npresent time is the principal industry of the place. The township is\r\nbounded on the north by the city and town of Newburgh, from which it\r\nis separated by Quassaick Creek, an outlet of Washington Lake,\r\nformerly known as Little Pond, also a portion of the town of\r\nMontgomery; on the west by the towns of Montgomery and Hamptonburgh;\r\non the south by Blooming Grove and Cornwall. From the latter town it\r\nis separated by Moodna Creek, near its mouth. On the east it is\r\nbounded by the Hudson River.\r\n\r\nThe soil is of a sandy and gravelly nature, interspersed in some\r\nportions by rocks and large stones, of a diversified surface, being\r\nrolling and hilly. After leaving the river the surface gradually\r\nascends for a distance of two or three miles, interspersed with\r\ngentle elevations which have been utilized by retired business men\r\nof New York for sightly country residences, most of which command a\r\nmagnificent view of the noble Hudson, and the picturesque Highlands\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\nOn the northern edge of the town rises Snake Hill, or more recently\r\ncalled Muchattoes Hill, an elevation of 600 feet above the river. It\r\nlies north and south and is almost perpendicular on its eastern\r\nextremity, but slopes gradually on the west, from which the surface\r\nis again rolling and adapted to agricultural purposes. At the\r\ndistance of about five miles from the river the town is crossed north\r\nand south by two ridges, rising in amphitheatre form, from whose\r\nsummit is obtained a most elegant view of the surrounding country.\r\nThe Highlands on the south, the Fishkill Mountains on the east, the\r\nShawangunk Mountains on the north, and the Sugar Loaf and Schunnemunk\r\nMountains on the west.\r\n\r\nPATENTS.\r\n\r\nThe earliest recorded patent was issued to Patrick McGregorie in\r\n1685. Others were as follows: 1,000 acres to William Chambers and\r\nWilliam Southerland, September 2, 1709; 4,000 acres (in part) to\r\nCharles Huddy and Phillip Brooks, February 20, 1709; this included\r\nsubsequently a portion granted to Mary Ingoldsby and her daughter,\r\nMary Pinkhorn, August 12, 1720; 4,000 acres to John Haskell of the\r\ndates of April 9, 1719, and April 24, 1721; 800 acres to Vincent\r\nMatthews, June 17, 1720; 1,000 acres to John Johnson, February 3,\r\n1720; 1184 acres to James Henderson, February 12, 1722; 1,000 acres\r\nto Vincent Price (in part), July 21, 1721; 2,000 acres to Andrew\r\nJohnson, July 19, 1719; 1,000 acres to Louis Morris, July 21, 1721;\r\n2,000 acres to Patrick Hume, November 29, 1721; 3,292 acres to\r\nCornelius Low & Co. (mainly), March 20, 1720; 1,000 acres to Richard\r\nVan Dam (in part), June 30, 1720; 2,000 acres to Phineas Mcintosh\r\n(mainly) April 9, 1719, and some portions of the patent granted to\r\nCadwallader Colden, April 9, 1719, some portions of which and the Low\r\n& McIntosh patents were cut off in 1830, when the town of\r\nHamptonburgh was created.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of October, 1734, Dr. John Nicoll, of New York, purchased\r\nof John Waldron, Cornelius Van Horn and James Livingston 7,500 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber and Southerland patents were divided November 7, 1723,\r\ninto three equal parts. Chambers occupying the northern part,\r\nMatthews the central Part and Southerland the southern part, on the\r\ndeath of the latter in 1738, his portion passed to his two sons,\r\nWilliam and John. On the death of William, without issue, John\r\ninherited and also obtained, in 1753, the water front from the\r\nvillage of New Windsor to Quassaick Creek. He sold this to Nathaniel\r\nSmith, of Kingston in 1738, together with a portion of the Ingoldsby\r\npatent, purchased by his father in 1726; also a portion of the\r\nGerman patent purchased by himself in 1742. Smith sold a portion to\r\nRobert Boyd, Jr., and another to George Clinton upon which the latter\r\nerected a house in 1769, and resided here until elected Governor in\r\n1777, when he removed to Poughkeepsie. From him was purchased what is\r\nknown as the Walsh farm on the Quassaick Creek, recently in the\r\npossession of his grandson, E. J. Dewitt Walsh. On this portion of\r\nthe tract was Admiral William Chambers; Associate Judge John\r\nChambers, 1751; Governor George Clinton, 1776; Captain Charles\r\nLudlow, U. S. N. The central portion held by Matthews was purchased\r\nby John Aslop, 1724, whose son John Aslop, Jr., was prominent in the\r\nRevolution, and grandfather of Governor John Aslop King, in 1749. He\r\nalso sold that portion on which the village of New Windsor stands to\r\nthe company called the \"Proprietors\" of New Windsor, September 9,\r\n1749. Their names were Vincent Matthews, Ebenezer Seely, Michael\r\nJackson, Joseph Sackett, David Marvin, Evan Jones and Brant Schuyler.\r\n\r\nThe Southerlands tract came into the possession of Thomas Ellison in\r\nMay, 1723, who erected a stone mansion on the bluff overlooking the\r\nriver; also a storehouse and dock on the river, and conducted a\r\nprosperous business for over a century. His mansion was the\r\nheadquarters of General Washington from 1779; until he moved to the\r\nHasbrouck House in Newburgh.\r\n\r\nHe also purchased the Vincent Matthews patent, adjoining, at Vail's\r\nGate, in May, 1724, upon which his son, Thomas Ellison, Jr., erected\r\nin 1754 the stone mansion and a mill, which subsequently came into\r\nthe possession of his son John, and is now known as General Knox\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nThe fourth patent was on the Ingoldsby patent in 1726, by John Gate,\r\nwho sold to Thomas Ellison in 1736. He sold a portion to James\r\nEdmonston in 1727, upon which the latter erected a stone house in\r\n1754, just west of Vail's Gate, which figured conspicuously in the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nDr. John Nicoll came into possession of a considerable tract, from\r\none Peter Post in 1738, which extended from New Windsor village to\r\nthe base of Snake Hill; his great-grandson now resides upon a portion\r\nof it on the river road.\r\n\r\nDavid Mandeville purchased the Mary Ingoldsby patent May 1st, 1728,\r\nand sold to Samuel and Nathaniel Hazard who erected a mill which is\r\nstill standing.\r\n\r\nA patent was granted to Colonel John Haskell in 1719 of 2,000 acres\r\nand another 2,000 acres in 1721 upon which he settled in 1726. He\r\nerected a log cabin on what was known as the Dusenberry farm, upon\r\nwhich the army erected the Temple when encamped there. Other early\r\nsettlers upon this tract were: Even Jones, Samuel Brewster, Elizabeth\r\nStollard, Andrew Crawford and Neil McArthur.\r\n\r\nThe first settler upon the McIntosh patent was John Davis, July 5th,\r\n1726; others about this time were Robert Boyd and the Dill families.\r\nThrough his wife, Sarah McIntosh, Nathan Smith came into possession\r\nof a considerable portion of this tract and erected thereon a grist\r\nmill, a fulling mill and a store.\r\n\r\nThe first settler upon the Andrew Johnson patent upon which Little\r\nBritain now stands was John Humphrey, 1724; Peter Mullinder, 1729;\r\nalso Mary McClaughry, John Read, Robert Burnett, in the same year;\r\nCharles Clinton, Alexander Denniston, John Young, Andrew McDowell,\r\n1731.\r\n\r\nThe Mailler family were here prior to 1730, who sold to Robert\r\nCarscadden. Among others who settled here with the Clintons were the\r\nArmstrongs, Beatty, Barkly, Brooks, Denniston, Davis, Dunlap, Frazer,\r\nGordon, Gray, Hamilton, Little, Mitchell, McDowell, McClaughry,\r\nOliver, Nicholson, Thompson, Wilson and Young, whose descendants are\r\nnumerous in the county.\r\n\r\nThe Low and Co.'s patent of 3,292 acres was granted to Peter Low,\r\nGarret Schuyler and John Schuyler and was divided among them. The\r\nthird portion of John Schuyler passed by will to his nephews, Brant\r\nand Samuel Schuyler. Brant Schuyler eventually becoming sole\r\npossessor.

Beatty, the son of a sister of Charles Clinton, became a\r\ndistinguished clergyman, some of whose descendants still reside at\r\nSalisbury Mills in this county.\r\n\r\nJames Gambell and John Humphrey purchased of the Hume patent 300\r\nacres, April 6, 1730, and divided it equally between them. Gambell\r\nsold to Patrick Byrne, March 12, 1744, and Humphrey sold to Patrick\r\nMcClaughry, February 22, 1769. The remaining portion of this patent\r\nwas sold by James Ludlow, a nephew of the patentee, to James Neely,\r\nHenry M. Neely, William Young and Patrick McClaughry. William Young\r\nsold to Samuel Sly 233 acres, and Gambell and Humphrey sold their\r\nportion to William Tilford and Samuel Falls.\r\n\r\nCadwallader Colden became the owner of the John Johnson patent of\r\n2,000 acres at the date of its issue. A portion of the Belknap family\r\nsettled upon it in 1750.\r\n\r\nThe Van Dam patent of 5,000 acres passed into the possession of\r\nJessie Woodhull in 1753, also a portion to Peter Gallatin, John\r\nMoffat and the Walling Brothers. This tract is now included in the\r\npresent town of Blooming Grove.\r\n\r\nThe small Henderson patent early passed into the possession of John\r\nWandel and David Edmonston.\r\n\r\nThe Lewis Morris patent of 1,000 acres was owned by Alexander\r\nDenniston, Francis Crawford, Thomas Cook and William Denniston in\r\n1786, purchased from earlier settlers.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned under the head of patents, many of the\r\nearly settlers. The earliest were those of Colonel McGregorie at Plum\r\nPoint in 1685, and the Reverend Richard Charlton, sent out by the\r\nLondon Missionary Society in 1732, for the parish of New Windsor,\r\nwhich was connected with the Church of England. Among the names of\r\nthe owners of the village were: Ebenezer Seeley, Brant Schuyler,\r\nHenry Case, Vincent Matthews, Michael Jackson, Daniel Everet, Even\r\nJones, Hezekiah Howell, Joseph Sackett, Jr., James Tuthill, John\r\nSackett, Jr., Colonel Charles Clinton, 1731; Dr. John Nicoll, 1734;\r\nWilliam Ellison, 1732; John Ellison, Captain Jas. Jackson, William\r\nJackson, Thomas Ellison, Isaac Shultz, Messrs. Logan, Bryam,\r\nHalstead, Denniston and others. At Little Britain, John Humphrey,\r\n1724; Peter Mulliner, 1729, who gave it the name from Windsor Castle\r\nin England; Robert Burnett, John Reid, 1729; Charles Clinton, John\r\nand James McClaughry, Alexander Denniston and John Young in 1731.\r\nAmong those who came from Ireland were James Edmonston, 1720; the\r\nClintons, Alsop, Chambers, Lawrence, Haskins, etc., 1731, who settled\r\nin the eastern portion of the town, while the Coldens, Matthews,\r\nWileman, Mcintosh, Bulls, settled in the more western portion.\r\n\r\nNOTED RESIDENTS.\r\n\r\nThe most noted residents of this town were those of the Clinton\r\nfamily. Charles Clinton, the father of James and George, was a native\r\nof Langford, Ireland, of Scotch-English descent. He sailed with a\r\ncompany of relatives and friends in 1729, to escape persecution.\r\nHaving espoused the cause of the Stewarts at the accession of the\r\nHouse of Hanover in 1689, he settled at Little Britain in 1731. He\r\nwas a highly educated man and gave his sons a good education. He was\r\na surveyor and a judge of the court of common pleas and fought in the\r\nFrench and Indian Wars, 1759 to 1763, was public spirited, had five\r\nsons and two daughters, lived to the ripe old age of eighty-three and\r\ndied at home, November 19th, 1773.\r\n\r\nOne son and a daughter died at sea. Two of his oldest sons, Alexander\r\nand Charles, were physicians. James and George figured conspicuously\r\nin the early history of the Empire State. James, born in 1756,\r\npreferred the army to politics. He served with his father in the\r\ntaking of Fort Frontenac in Canada, also in the invasion by the\r\nIndians of Orange and Ulster Counties, rose to major-general in the\r\nwar of the Revolution, was in charge of the northern department, led\r\nan expedition against the Iroquois, cut a road from the Mohawk to\r\nLake Otsego, dammed the outlet of the lake and floated the boats over\r\nthe upper Susquehanna to reach the lower country with his command,\r\nwas at the siege of Yorktown, member of the assembly, ratified the\r\nConstitution of the United Slates, and was a member of the convention\r\nof 1804 to amend the State Constitution; died at his home December\r\n12th, 1812, 75 years of age; was buried in the family burying ground\r\nby the side of his father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rev. Charles Gorse.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Clinton, while a very young man, sailed in a privateer in the\r\nFrench War, was with his father and brother at the siege of Fort\r\nFrontenac, studied law under Judge William Smith, was clerk of Ulster\r\nCounty in 1759, member of the assembly in 1780, elected to the\r\nContinental Congress in 1775, Brigadier-General in 1776, first\r\nGovernor of New York in 1777; commanded a brigade at the defense of\r\nNew York City in 1776. He was in command of the forts in the\r\nHighlands which he nobly defended with 600 raw militia against 5,000\r\nveteran British troops, and was overwhelmed and obliged to surrender\r\nin 1777; was Governor of the State for eighteen years, administering\r\nits trying duties with conspicuous ability; was president of the\r\nconvention which met at Poughkeepsie in 1788; Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States in 1804; died soon after his re-election in 1808; has\r\nbeen designated as the father of the State. On the beautiful monument\r\nin the old Dutch Churchyard in Kingston, N. Y., is the following:\r\n\"To the memory of George Clinton, born in the State of New York, 26th\r\nday of July, 1738, died at the City of Washington the 20th of April,\r\n1812, in the 73rd year of his age. Soldier and Statesman of the\r\nRevolution, eminent in council, distinguished in war, he filled with\r\nunexampled usefulness, purity and ability, among other high offices\r\nthose of Governor of his native State, and Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States. While he lived, his virtue, wisdom and valor were the\r\npride, the ornament and security of his country, and when he died he\r\nleft an illustrious instance and example of a well-spent life, worthy\r\nof all imitation.\"\r\n\r\nDeWitt Clinton, a son of James, was born March 2nd, 1769, the exact\r\nplace, being in dispute, some authorities claim at Fort DeWitt in\r\nDeer Park, while his mother was there on a visit; others claim at the\r\nhome of his father, either at Little Britain or while he was residing\r\nin the village of New Windsor. Perhaps it doesn't matter so much\r\nwhere a man is born as what he may make of himself by strenuous\r\nefforts, as was the case with the illustrious Lincoln and the subject\r\nof this sketch. After graduation at Columbia College in 1786, he\r\nstudied law with Samuel Jones; was admitted to the bar in 1789;\r\nbecame soon after secretary to the Governor, his uncle, and became\r\ndevoted to politics; subsequently filled with great ability the\r\nfollowing honorable positions: Member of the Assembly, State Senator,\r\nmember of the council of appointment, United States Senator, Mayor of\r\nthe City of New York, many times member of the council board,\r\nGovernor of the State for two terms, candidate for President of the\r\nUnited States, being defeated by Madison, and was invited by Mr.\r\nAdams to serve as minister to England, and was the author of\r\ntwenty-six acts which became incorporated in the laws of the State\r\nand nation. The following panegyric was given by William H. Seward,\r\nthe political successor to the Clintons in New York State, in 1871.\r\n\r\n\"Only next after Alexander Hamilton, DeWitt Clinton was the wisest\r\nstatesman, the greatest public benefactor, that in all her history\r\nthe State of New York has produced.\" This was from the man who ten\r\nyears after sat in his chair and persevered in carrying out his\r\npolicies which established for New York the political leadership of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nAlexander Denniston came over with Charles Clinton and settled at\r\nLittle Britain in 1731.\r\n\r\nRobert Burnett came from Scotland in 1725, and purchased 200 acres at\r\nLittle Britain in 1729.\r\n\r\nColonel James McClaughry, born in Philadelphia, when nine years old\r\nwas brought by his uncle, John McClaughry, to Little Britain, all the\r\nway behind his uncle on horseback. He married Kate, a sister of\r\nGovernor Clinton, received a colonel's commission at the commencement\r\nof the war, commanded a regiment at Fort Montgomery, 1777, where he\r\nwas taken prisoner and sent to a hospital in New York, where he would\r\nhave perished but for the extra care and comforts provided by his\r\ngood wife, who ministered also to many others there. He returned to\r\nhis farm at the close of the war and lived until 1790, dying at the\r\nage of 69.\r\n\r\nMartin Dubois, a neighbor of Robert Burnett and General James\r\nClinton, was an assistant quarter-master during the war.\r\n\r\nCadwallader Colden, Jr., of Coldenham, who married Betsy, a daughter\r\nof Thomas Ellison, of New Windsor, was a son of Cadwallader Colden,\r\nSr. He was lieutenant-governor of the State from 1760 to 1770. He was\r\narrested as a Tory in June, 1776, by the council of safety of the\r\ntowns of New Windsor and Newburgh, and after due trial was confined\r\nin jail at Kingston, where he remained, for over a year, after which\r\nhe was liberated on parole. The town of Coldenham is named after his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nREVOLUTIONARY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThis town is rich in Revolutionary lore. A portion of the troops of\r\nColonel James Clinton were organized here in 1775. A battery of\r\nfourteen guns were mounted at Plum Point in 1776. The militia were\r\nrallied here in 1777, after the fall of the Highland forts and during\r\nthe winter of 1779, 1780, 1781, 1782 and 1783, nine brigades under\r\ncommand of General Heath, were encamped at the foot of the ridge just\r\nwest of Snake Hill and just south of the square at Little Britain.\r\n\r\nWashington concentrated his forces here in 1779 and made his\r\nheadquarters at the William Ellison house at New Windsor village, and\r\nremained there until 1782, when he removed to the Hasbrouck House in\r\nNewburgh and remained there until the army was disbanded in 1783.\r\nOther generals of the army were quartered at John Ellison's. Here\r\nwere Generals Knox and Greene, while Gates and St. Claire were at the\r\nEdmonston House, Wayne at Newburgh and Baron Stuben at Fishkill,\r\nLafayette at William Ellison's at the foot of Forge Hill. Other\r\ngenerals were quartered at the old Stone Hotel just west of\r\nEdmonston's. When Washington brought his army from New Jersey in\r\n1779, he probably marched over the road from Goshen or Chester to New\r\nWindsor now known as the Vail's Gate-Chester State road, but which at\r\nthat time must have been in a very rough and primitive condition, for\r\na hill just west of Vail's Gate derives its name of Pork Hill from\r\nthe fact that one of the commissary wagons loaded with salt pork was\r\noverturned on this hill, a conspicuous example how names will stick\r\nto places as well as to individuals. When Colonel Morgan marched\r\nthrough New Windsor with his three thousand riflemen to join\r\nWashington at Boston, a man preceded him who represented himself as\r\nColonel Morgan to Mr. John Ellison, but when the Colonel himself\r\narrived soon afterwards, the impostor was detected and was given over\r\nto his men for punishment, who gave him an effectual coat of tar and\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nAt the camp grounds between Vail's Gate and Little Britain, the\r\nwriter has traced the foundations of many of the huts in which the\r\narmy was encamped from 1779 to 1782. The foundations were of stone,\r\nsurmounted by hewn logs. A level meadow in front of the barracks was\r\ncleared for this purpose and utilized as a parade ground, but was of\r\nso marshy a character that for marching and drilling it required\r\npaving with flat stones, many of which are still in evidence. This\r\nmust have been a labor of infinite difficulty and shows of what\r\nsturdy material these men were made. At the lower border of this\r\nparade ground was also constructed a causeway to the ridge opposite,\r\nupon which was erected a temple or public building, near which were\r\nalso the barracks for some of the minor officers, a hospital, bakery,\r\nand a little further east the burying ground. To commemorate the site\r\nof this temple the Newburgh Revolutionary Monument Association has\r\nerected a rough stone monument on the farm of the late William L.\r\nMcGill, now owned and occupied by his married daughter, Mrs. Richard\r\nSmith. It commands an uninterrupted view of the Hudson Highlands and\r\nthe majestic river rolling between, offering exceptional advantages\r\nfor watching the approach of any vessel on the river or of any\r\nconsiderable body of men from that direction.\r\n\r\nNOTED BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\nAt Plum Point, formerly a portion of the Nicholl estate, still stands\r\nthe stately mansion of the late Phillips Verplank. On the river side\r\nis the earthwork for the protection of the Chevaux-de-frise, one of\r\nfive obstructions placed in the river at various points to prevent\r\nthe ascent of the British fleet, but which proved ineffectual, as the\r\nships of the enemy broke them all, and ascended the river to\r\nKingston, which it burned.\r\n\r\nSome portion of this boom and chain are now to be seen at\r\nWashington's Headquarters at Newburgh. A Scotchman by the name of\r\nMcEvers, also located here, built a log cabin or tenement long prior\r\nto the Revolution; the excavation for the cellar, as well as the\r\nembankment, are still plainly visible.\r\n\r\nThe point is approached by a natural causeway from the river road,\r\nupon the opposite side of which stands the old-fashioned homestead of\r\nDr. Nicoll, who purchased 500 acres of Peter Post and settled here in\r\n1730.\r\n\r\nOn the bluff just south of the village of New Windsor stood the stone\r\nhouse erected and occupied by William Ellison and also by Washington\r\nas his headquarters from 1779 to 1782. This is now replaced by a\r\nmodern Queen Anne building the residence of his grandson, Thomas\r\nEllison.\r\n\r\nMartha Washington is said to have visited the General while here.\r\nHis estrangement from Hamilton also occurred here in 1781.\r\n\r\nThe Brewster House, known as Lafayette's headquarters, is situated\r\njust across the Moodna at the foot of Forge Hill.\r\n\r\nThe steep hill which ascends from this point to Vail's Gate derives\r\nits name from this circumstance. The iron used in its construction\r\nwas transported on the backs of mules or horses from the forests of\r\nDean Mines in Monroe. As you ascend Forge Hill just at its top you\r\ncome to the most noted Revolutionary building now in existence in the\r\ntown, known as General Knox's headquarters. It was built for Mr. John\r\nEllison in 1735, and was in the possession of the Morton family for a\r\nnumber of years, who endeavored to change the name of the place to\r\nMortonville, and for a time the post-office was known by this name,\r\nbut on the death of the major it reverted back to the old name of\r\nVail's Gate, from the toll gate stationed here, kept by the Vail\r\nfamily, father and son, for many years; this gate was still in\r\nexistence in 1872.\r\n\r\nGenerals Knox and Greene, Colonels Riddle and Wadsworih were\r\nquartered here in 1779 to 1781 and General Rochambeau was also a\r\nvisitor here to Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Edmonston building near the short cut crossing on the Erie at\r\nVail's Gate, was built by James Edmonston in 1755. During the\r\nencampment of the Continental Army in this vicinity, it was made the\r\nheadquarters of Generals Gates and St. Claire, and some of the other\r\nofficers; also the hospital and military stores were kept here. When\r\nWashington arrived here with his army, he consulted with Edmonston as\r\nto the best place to locate his camp and was conducted over a bridle\r\npath by his son William to the Square which became their camp.\r\n\r\nAt the Square, so-called from being surrounded by four roads, is the\r\nFalls' House, occupied by the Widow Falls in 1777, when it was the\r\nrallying point for the scattered militia by General Clinton after the\r\nfall of the Highland forts. It is a wooden structure just opposite\r\nthe Silver Stream school-house, now occupied by Mr. Charles Merritt.\r\nIt was while General Clinton was here that the incident of the silver\r\nball occurred. Major Daniel Taylor had been sent with dispatches\r\nconcealed in a small silver ball by Sir Henry Clinton for Burgoyne.\r\nHe was captured October 10th, 1777. After he had been conducted to\r\nthe presence of General George Clinton, instead of Sir Henry, as he\r\nsupposed, he swallowed the ball. Dr. Moses Higby, who was in the\r\nneighborhood, administered an emetic and it was soon disgorged. It\r\ncontained the following on very thin paper:\r\n\r\n    Fort Montgomery, Oct. 8th. 1777.\r\n\r\n \"_Nous y, voici_, and nothing now between us but Gates. I sincerely\r\nhope this little success of ours will facilitate your operations. In\r\nanswer to your letter of September 28th by C. C., I shall only say,\r\nI cannot presume to order or even advise, for obvious reasons. I\r\nheartily wish you success.\r\n\r\n     \"Faithfully, yours,\r\n\r\n           \"H. Clinton.\"\r\n\r\nTaylor was tried, condemned and executed as a spy.\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nIt was upon what was then known as the Dusenberry farm, formerly a\r\nportion of the General Haskins' estate, an English officer who\r\nsettled 4,000 acres, during the old French War, that this building\r\nwas erected under the supervision of General Heath, for the use of\r\nthe army and for Masonic meetings.\r\n\r\nIt was here that General Lafayette was made a Mason by the American\r\nUnion League, which accompanied the army. It was built of hewn logs,\r\n80 X 40 ft., with a barrack roof, first known as the Temple of\r\nVirtues, but on account of a carousal of the officers after the\r\ndeparture of Washington, on the night of its dedication, it was\r\nafterwards known simply as the temple.\r\n\r\nIt was also used for public services on the Sabbath. At the close of\r\nthe war, a proclamation by Congress of the cessation of hostilities\r\nwas read from its door and a celebration on a grand scale was held.\r\nHere also was held the meeting to consider the Newburgh letters,\r\nwritten by a Major Armstrong, to determine, \"whether the army should\r\nrise superior to the grievances under which it had long suffered, and\r\nprecipitate a separation between the military and civil powers.\" It\r\nwas a vital crisis in the history of the republic, and a tragic\r\nending prevented by an address of Washington to the officers at this\r\ntime, which is a lasting monument to his unselfish patriotism,\r\nprofound wisdom, superior ability and marked discretion. The Society\r\nof the Cincinnati was founded here in 1783. \"To perpetuate among the\r\nofficers of the army and their descendants, the memory of their\r\ntoils, trials, friendships and triumphs, for succeeding ages.\" The\r\nfollowing were among the signers: Lieutenant Robert Burnett,\r\nBrigadier James Clinton, Lieutenant Alexander Clinton, Lieutenant\r\nDaniel Denniston, Lieutenant George J. Denniston, Captain James\r\nGregg, Captain Jonathan Lawrence, Major Samuel Logan, Ensign Joseph\r\nMorrell, Lieutenant William Stranahan, Lieutenant William Scudder,\r\nmany of whose descendants are residents of the county.\r\n\r\nOn the northern side of the monument spoken of as marking the site of\r\nthe temple, is the following inscription: \"Erected by the Newburgh\r\nRevolutionary Monument Association, 1891. E. M. Ruttenber, president;\r\nJames M. Dickey, vice-president; A. A. McLean, treasurer; Russell\r\nHeadley, secretary.\"\r\n\r\nOn the western face is the following: \"_Omnia reliquit servere\r\nrempublicam._ On this site the Society of the Cincinnati was born May\r\n10th, 1783, at the last cantonment occupied by the American Army, and\r\nit still lives to perpetuate the memories of the Revolution.\r\nCommittee of the New York State Society of the Cincinnati, Fourth of\r\nJuly, 1802. T. M L. Christy, chairman, William Simm Keese, John\r\nShayler.\"\r\n\r\nOn the southern face: \"On this ground was erected the temple or\r\npublic building by the army of the Revolution, 1782-1783--the\r\nbirthplace of the republic. This tablet is inscribed by the Masonic\r\nFraternity of Newburgh, and its Masonic confreres under whose\r\ndirection and plans the temple was constructed, and in which\r\ncommunications of the fraternity were held, 1783.\"\r\n\r\nThe Clinton homestead was situated about two miles north of\r\nWashingtonville, on the road to Little Britain.\r\n\r\nVILLAGES.\r\n\r\nNew Windsor, in its early history, was the scene of great commercial\r\nactivity and the outlet by the river for the produce of the country\r\nfor miles around and promised to be the site of a flourishing town,\r\nbut the limited extent of land between the river and the high bluff,\r\nof about 120 feet in length, but a short distance from the river,\r\nprecluded the possibility of building any large towns between. This\r\nhigh bluff is composed of clay which is utilized in the manufacture\r\nof a fine quality of brick. Mr. William Lahey, who has two\r\nbrick yards, is the leading manufacturer. Mr. Hugh Davidson and the\r\nlate Mr. Walsh each owned one. The remains of several docks on the\r\nriver front are still in evidence of its former business activity. A\r\nferry to Fishkill was maintained for a number of years and until\r\nNewburgh sprang up and superseded it in commercial life it was a\r\nflourishing town. At the present time there are some thirty houses,\r\nstores and saloons, scattered along the river bank, occupied by about\r\ntwo hundred inhabitants. The first glass factory in this country was\r\nalso built here.\r\n\r\nMoodna, formerly called Orangeville, situated at the mouth of the\r\nMoodna Creek, is a small hamlet of perhaps thirty houses. There are\r\nalso two factories at this place, a paper mill, formerly that of\r\nTownsend, now owned by the Hemmingway Paper Co., and a cotton mill\r\nowned by Mr. John Broadhead, of Firthcliffe, which is now closed.\r\nPlum Point, of Revolutionary fame, juts out into the river just north\r\nof the village and is frequently visited by tourists.\r\n\r\nVail's Gate, four and a half miles from Newburgh, contains about\r\nthirty-five houses, a Methodist Episcopal church, three hotels, and a\r\ngeneral store, where Mr. Thomas Gushing has a new building.\r\n\r\nThe General Knox headquarters, the Edmonston house, and the old hotel\r\nbuildings of stone are the most noted Revolutionary relics. The\r\npopulation is probably about four hundred.\r\n\r\nLittle Britain, made famous as the home of the Clintons, extends from\r\nthe Square to the Little Britain creamery. At the Square are a dozen\r\nhouses, most prominent among which is the Alexander Falls house. Here\r\nGeneral Washington was a frequent visitor during the encampment of\r\nthe army just south.\r\n\r\nRocklet, a small hamlet in the extreme western part of town, has a\r\nstore and post-office, kept by Mr. Frank Mulliner.\r\n\r\nThe Ontario and Western railroad intersects the township for a\r\ndistance of seven miles and is taxed for $85,000; Erie, six miles,\r\nassessed for $42,000; West Shore, five miles, assessed for $22,000.\r\n\r\nThe schools are--District No. 1, New Windsor; No. 2, Moodna; No. 3,\r\nVail's Gate; No. 4, Mount Arie; No. 5, Silver Stream; No. 6, Little\r\nBritain; No. 7, Alexander Neighborhood; No. 8, Rocklet.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\n_St. Thomas._--By the will of Thomas Ettson, Jr., fifty-six acres of\r\nland and the sum of six thousand pounds, English money, was\r\nbequeathed to his brother, William, and nephew Thomas, to be held in\r\ntrust for the maintenance of a Glebe and minister under the\r\njurisdiction of the Protestant Episcopal Church at New Windsor, the\r\ninterest of said lands and sum to be paid yearly to the minister when\r\nin active service; when there was no service the interest therefrom\r\nwas to be added to the principal. When a religious organization\r\nshould be effected, the said lands and sum were to be conveyed to it.\r\nSuch an organization was established, April 18, 1818, under the title\r\nof St. Thomas' Church, and the Rev. John Brown, then a resident of\r\nNew Windsor, also serving St. George's Church at Newburgh, became its\r\nrector and continued so up to 1847.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, the old church having been destroyed by fire, a new one was\r\nstarted in 1847, and the present church completed in 1849. The old\r\nrectory having been burned, a new one was built in 1849. The value of\r\nthe church property is estimated at $13,000. Among the prominent\r\nmembers who have been here for a good many years are, Messrs. Aymar\r\nVan Buren, J. Abner Harper, John Harper, F. W. Senff, R. D. Jeffreys,\r\nW. C. Gregg, the Misses Morton, Mrs. Leonard F. Nicol and others.\r\n\r\n_New Windsor Presbyterian._--This church was organized in 1794. It\r\nwas associated with Newburgh or Bethlehem churches. From 1828 to 1834\r\nthe Rev. J. H. Thomas, of the Canterbury Presbyterian Church, served\r\nalso this church, and from 1834 to 1835 he served this church\r\nexclusively. The first building was used by the Continentals as a\r\nhospital. This was subsequently destroyed by fire and the present\r\nstructure was erected in 1807.\r\n\r\n_M. E. Church at Vail's Gate._--This church celebrated the centennial\r\nof its existence in the fall of 1806. the present building having\r\nbeen erected in 1706, and is the oldest church edifice. Its society\r\noriginated from a union class started by John Ellison in 1789, and\r\nwas conducted in one of his tenements for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\n_Little Britain M. E. Church_ was erected in 1853 and occupied in\r\n1854, and has been associated with other churches mostly during its\r\nexistence. Services were held here up to 1885, since which it has\r\nremained closed.\r\n\r\n_Little Britain Presbyterian Church_ was organized in 1760 as\r\nAssociated Reformed by Scotch and Irish emigrants. The first edifice\r\nwas erected in 1765, and rebuilt in 1826. Its first pastor, Robert\r\nAnnan, was installed in 1768, and served until 1783. Rev. Thomas J.\r\nSmith was his successor in 1791, who served until 1812, when Rev.\r\nJames Schringeour, a Scotchman, was installed, and served until his\r\ndeath in 1825.\r\n\r\nCEMETERIES.\r\n\r\nThe two principal cemeteries in this town are \"Calvary,\" at the\r\njunction of Quassaic avenue and the Walsh road, established within\r\nthe last decade by the Catholics, and \"Woodlawn,\" a half mile further\r\nwest, which contains about thirty acres and has been in existence\r\nabout twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient burying ground connected with the Presbyterian church\r\nat the village of New Windsor, are the graves of James Williams and\r\nwife, Abigale Brewster; John Yelverton, one of the original settlers,\r\nwho died in 1767 at the age of 74; Joseph Morrell, one of the heroes\r\nof the Revolution. Other early settlers whose names are recorded on\r\ntombstones are the Moores, Walshes, Logans, Brewsters and others. In\r\nconnection with the M. E. Church at Vail's Gate is also another old\r\nburial ground. Here are the Mortons, the Stills, the Vails and many\r\nothers of the forefathers of the hamlet who \"rest from their labors\r\nand their works do follow them.\"\r\n\r\nJames Clinton, the father of DeWitt Clinton, was buried in the\r\nfamily burying ground on the Clinton estate. When the patriotic\r\ncitizens of Newburgh thought to remove his remains to Woodlawn and\r\nerect a monument to his memory, all that could be found was the\r\ncoffin plate. The following epitaph to the memory of his father was\r\nwritten by his son, DeWitt: \"He had filled with fidelity and honor\r\nseveral distinguished civil offices, was an officer of the\r\nRevolutionary War, and the war preceding, and at the close of the\r\nformer was a major general in the army of the United States. He was a\r\ngood man and a sincere patriot, performing in a most exemplary manner\r\nall the duties of life, and he died as he lived, without fear and\r\nwithout reproach.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF TUXEDO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis triangular township is in the southeast corner of Orange County.\r\nIt is bounded on the north by the towns of Monroe and Woodbury, on\r\nthe east and south by Rockland County and on the west by the town of\r\nWarwick. Its area as given in the latest supervisors' report is\r\n27,839 acres, and the assessed valuation of real estate is placed at\r\n$2,510,500. The title to the soil is derived from the Chesekook\r\npatent.\r\n\r\nThe general topographical features are invested with peculiar charm.\r\nThe towering mountain crags and scattered bits of valley, the\r\nwildwood and forests primeval, are dimpled with beautiful lakes and\r\nthreaded with purling streams. The Ramapo, which is made up wholly by\r\nthe surplus waters of these lakes, has its head in Round Island Pond\r\nand flows thence southerly, through the valley which bears its name,\r\ninto Rockland County.\r\n\r\nThe name Tuxedo is, undoubtedly, the corruption of one or more Indian\r\nwords. In the language of the Algonquins, who occupied this region,\r\nit is found that to or tough mean \"a place.\" A frequent habit of the\r\nIndians was to name a place after the chief whose tribe occupied it,\r\nand there was a sachem named P'tauk-seet, \"the bear,\" who, in the\r\nseventeenth century, ruled over a tract of country including the\r\npresent town of Tuxedo. Uniting his name with tough, the Algonquin\r\nfor place, we should infer the original spelling to have been\r\nP'tauk-seet-tough, and its meaning \"Place of Bears.\" The earliest\r\nmention of the name occurs in Sargeant's survey of 1754 where\r\nreference is made to Tuxedo Pond. In Chesekook's patent of 1769 it is\r\nwritten Potuckett. Erskine, in his survey of 1778-1779, writes it\r\nTuxedo and Toxedo. In Eager's and Ruttenber's histories written\r\nrespectively in 1847 and 1875 the name is corrupted to Duck Cedar,\r\nwith the explanation that its margin is over-thrown with cedars and\r\nthat it is a favorite haunt of wild ducks.\r\n\r\nThe first description of this region is written by the Marquis de\r\nChastellux, a French officer who came to America with Lafayette, and\r\nwho, on December 19, 1780, following the Continental road through\r\nthe gorge south of the lake, then called \"The Clove,\" presently came\r\nin view of Tuxedo. He mentions that at Ringwood he stopped to ask his\r\nway, and that at Erskine's house they gave him full information about\r\nthe roads and wood-paths, and also \"a glass of Madeira, in accordance\r\nwith a custom of the country, which will not allow you to leave a\r\nhouse without taking something.\" Having been thus refreshed, he says:\r\n\"I got on horseback and penetrated afresh into the woods, mounting\r\nand descending precipitous hills until I found myself at the edge of\r\na lake so secluded that it is hardly visible from the surrounding\r\nthicket. Its banks are so steep that if a deer made a false step on\r\nthe top he would infallibly roll into the lake. This lake, which is\r\nnot marked upon the charts, and is called Duck Sider, is about three\r\nmiles long and two miles wide (sic!), and is in the wildest and most\r\ndeserted country I have yet passed through. My poetic imagination was\r\nenjoying the solitude, when, at a distance, I perceived in an open\r\nspot, a quadruped, which a nearer observation showed to be not the\r\nelk or caribou, for which I at first mistook him, but a horse grazing\r\npeaceably in a field belonging to a new settlement.\"\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nFollowing the grant of the Chesekook patent in 1702 there was no\r\nsettlement in this territory for many years. The families who came\r\nwere mostly of English ancestry and moved from Long Island and the\r\nEastern States. The Smiths are supposed to have explored this region\r\nas early as 1727. The first settlement in the vicinity of Tuxedo Lake\r\nwas made at the northern extremity of this body of water. Prior to\r\n1765, a woodcutter named Hasenclever enclosed a ten-acre tract lying\r\nequally on both sides of the outlet. On a survey made in 1778 is\r\nshown his enclosure and the dam built by him, and also the position\r\nof the house, situated fifty yards northeasterly from the dam, and\r\nbuilt by a man named Howard, who was probably \"the original settler.\"\r\nDuring the Revolution, when the iron works on the Ramapo were liable\r\nto interruption by the British, Hasenclever's dam was raised several\r\nfeet, and the overflow turned southwest to supply the Ringwood\r\nfurnaces in New Jersey. During this period, Tuxedo Lake was the\r\nresort of a band of cowboys who at times found shelter among some\r\nrocks which they named after their leader, \"Claudius Smith's Cave.\"\r\n(See general history.)\r\n\r\nVicent Helms was chosen constable in 1775. Phineas and Brewster Helms\r\nare also mentioned in the records of the old Town of Cornwall of\r\nwhich this locality was then a part. The hamlet Helmsburgh indicates\r\nthe place where the families of that name lived before the\r\nRevolution. Moses Cunningham was a member of the first board of\r\nassessors of the town of Monroe erected in 1709. He lived at\r\nGreenwood Iron Works. Richard Wilkes, school commissioner in 1709,\r\nalso lived here. Adam Belcher, school commissioner in 1800, lived at\r\nSouthfields.\r\n\r\nThe survey and construction of the Continental road was performed by\r\nthe military engineers of the Continental Army in 1778. It entered\r\nthe park at the present south gate and followed the east lake shore\r\nat a somewhat lower level than the present road. From the Hoffman\r\ncorner it continued up to the east slope of the Alexander place to\r\nthe top of Tower Hill, where it crossed to the Coster place, thence\r\nto the Griswold place, which it crossed to the end of what is now the\r\nWee Wah Lake and left the park near the present north gate where it\r\njoined the main turnpike road of the Ramapo valley. There was also a\r\nwood road from the present east gate to the Continental road at the\r\nHoffman corner.\r\n\r\nCHANGING CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\nUp to 1864 the territory now embraced in the town of Tuxedo belonged\r\nto the town of Monroe. In the fall of 1883 a petition was sent to the\r\nboard of supervisors requesting that the town be divided into three\r\ntowns. The request was granted and the new towns were named\r\nrespectively Monroe, Southfield and Highland. Monroe held its town\r\nmeeting March 22, 1864, electing Chauncey B. Knight, supervisor.\r\nSouthfield did likewise, electing Josiah Patterson, supervisor, while\r\nHighland chose its old favorite Morgan Smith. This piece of political\r\nsurgery did not prove satisfactory, and in 1865 the Legislature\r\noverruled the action of the board of supervisors and restored to its\r\ncitizens the old town of Monroe.\r\n\r\nAgain in December of 1889 the board of supervisors were prevailed\r\nupon to effect a triple division of the town. The reason advanced for\r\nthis re-division was that the town was too large and its interests too\r\ndiverse for harmonious government. It was resolved that the division\r\nshould be made on the old lines, but that the names Tuxedo and\r\nWoodbury should be substituted for Southfield and Highland. This was\r\nduly passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. The lines\r\nwere run so as to give Monroe 12,101 acres, Tuxedo 27,839 acres and\r\nWoodbury 23,839 acres. However, the boundary line between Monroe and\r\nTuxedo had not been clearly determined or marked by monuments. When\r\nthe Heine Club desired to build a road from Mombasha to Southfield,\r\nit became a practical question how much of this road must be paid for\r\nby each town. Hence the question as to the dividing line. The men who\r\nwere with the 1863 surveyor said: \"It crossed Mombasha Pond, but they\r\ndid not know where.\" A survey was then made by F. J. Knight, who\r\nestablished a true line, demonstrating that the line of 1863 had been\r\na trial or random line. This decision placed Mombasha in the\r\nterritory of Monroe.\r\n\r\nIn January 1890, J. Spencer Ford represented the town of Tuxedo in\r\nthe board of supervisors; in 1894, Paul Tuckerman was elected\r\nsupervisor; Mahlon J. Brooks filled the office in 1896 and 1897, and\r\nCharles S. Patterson, the present incumbent, has served continuously\r\nsince 1898. Daniel F. Clark, the veteran bookkeeper, has held the\r\noffice of town clerk since 1890. Gillmore O. Bush, the present\r\npostmaster and captain of the park police, held the office of town\r\ncollector in 1890 and from 1894 to 1899. The assessors for 1907 are\r\nM. J. Brooks, Joseph W. Conklin and Benjamin Moffatt. The highway\r\ncommissioners are George Griswold, Benjamin Moffatt and William\r\nViner. District schools are located at Arden, Southfields, Eagle\r\nValley, Scott Mines, and in Tuxedo Village are the primary and union\r\nfree schools. Of the latter institutions, Mr. James Cronon has been\r\nthe efficient clerk of the board since 1891. A private preparatory\r\nschool is conducted within the limits of the park.\r\n\r\nEpiscopal churches are located at Arden and Tuxedo, Methodist\r\nEpiscopal churches at Southfields, Tuxedo and Scott Mines. The Roman\r\nCatholic church is in Tuxedo village.\r\n\r\nThe main line of the Erie Railroad parallels the Ramapo river through\r\nthe entire length of the town, and was opened in September, 1841. In\r\nthis valley are the hamlets that took part in the iron industry of a\r\ncentury ago. Augusta was the seat of the \"Augusta Works\" founded at\r\nthe close of the Revolution, 1783-1784, by Solomon Townsend of New\r\nYork, to make bar iron and anchors. It was an important enterprise\r\nbut not permanently successful. In later years the works came into\r\nthe ownership of P. Lorillard, who allowed them to remain idle.\r\nThirteen thousand acres of land were attached to the works.\r\nSouthfield was the name of the locality of the \"Southfield\" and\r\n\"Monroe\" works. These enterprises were established about 1805 to make\r\npig iron. The early proprietors were William and Peter Townsend.\r\nStirling Furnace, of which the Southfield plant became an important\r\nbranch, was in operation a century and a half ago. (See Warwick). The\r\nSterling Iron & Railway Company filed their annual report with the\r\ncounty clerk January 17, 1865. They purchased mines, manufactories and\r\nother property in southern Orange. Greenwood Iron Works was\r\nestablished in 1811 by the Messrs. Cunningham to make pig-iron. Mr.\r\nP. P. Parrott became the subsequent owner. The Parrott Iron Company\r\nwas formed by a certificate verified June 23, 1880. It engaged in\r\nmining and selling of iron ore and the manufacture of pig iron and\r\nsteel. The capital stock was stated as $500,000. The trustees named\r\nwere Peter P., Edward M., and R. D. A. Parrott. The locality is now\r\nknown as Arden, and is the headquarters of the Arden Dairy Farms, of\r\nwhich Mr. William A. McClellan is manager. A short distance\r\nnortheast, bordering Echo Lake, is the home of Mr. E. H. Harriman,\r\nwho owns vast tracts of land throughout this region. Helmsburgh is a\r\nrural mountain locality west of Southfields. Eagle Valley is a\r\nstation on the Erie Railroad, in the extreme southern angle of the\r\ntown, near the New Jersey line.\r\n\r\nTUXEDO PARK.\r\n\r\nThe tract of land containing this park consists of 7,000 acres, and\r\ncame into the possession of the Lorillard family in 1812. Shafts were\r\nsunk in various places in an attempt to find iron ore, but the\r\nproperty was otherwise undeveloped until the advent of the Erie\r\nRailroad in 1841. The locomotives burned wood in those days, and an\r\narrangement was made to supply the railroad with fuel. The hills and\r\nvalleys were covered with large forest trees, all of which were\r\nsacrificed, excepting a few along the Continental road. The station\r\nhere was for years known as the \"Wood Pile.\"\r\n\r\nAbout 1860 Tuxedo Lake was stocked with black bass, and from that\r\ntime the fishing was carefully preserved for the Lorillard family and\r\ntheir friends. Up to 1885 no better bass fishing could be found\r\nanywhere than that afforded by this beautiful lake. This suggested to\r\nMr. P. Lorillard (deceased, 1901), the idea of establishing here a\r\nshooting and fishing club. He bought out the other members of the\r\nfamily, and acquired a clear title to the whole tract. Five thousand\r\nacres were enclosed in a wire fence eight feet high. Deer were bought\r\nand turned loose. English pheasant eggs were procured in large\r\nquantities and several pheasant hatcheries were located. A fine trout\r\nhatchery was also built.\r\n\r\nHaving made a start on the preserve, Mr. Lorillard proceeded to\r\norganize the club. He gave a dinner to his sporting friends at the\r\nUnion Club, New York, and his idea met with an enthusiastic\r\nreception. Twenty gentlemen were appointed a board of governors.\r\nInvitations to join the club were sent out, and temporary\r\nheadquarters secured in New York.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the clubhouse were laid, and about 1,800 men were\r\nemployed in road-making. Before the new work was begun there was but\r\nthe Continental road through the park. The first park road\r\nconstructed was the Station road. The construction of the road around\r\nthe lake was then undertaken. As the work progressed Mr. Lorillard\r\ndecided, instead of a mere game preserve, to lay out a residential\r\npark. This plan involved enormous expense. Many roads were required\r\nto develop the building sites. A complete sewer and water system was\r\nconstructed. A village for shops and employees and a large livery\r\nstable were built. An office in the village for the transaction of\r\nthe park business was opened. At the same time Mr. Lorillard formed a\r\nstock company called the Tuxedo Park Association, to which he turned\r\nover all the lands and other assets of the park. The officers chosen\r\nwere: Mr. P. Lorillard, president; P. Lorillard, Jr., vice-president;\r\nGeorge D. Findley, treasurer, and William Kent, secretary. This\r\ncompany leased the clubhouse and grounds to the members for\r\ntwenty-one years, and guaranteed the new club against loss for the\r\nfirst ten years of its existence and subsequently during the term of\r\nthe lease. Fourteen houses were built and advertised for sale or\r\nrent. Twelve were located on Tower Hill and two across the dam at the\r\nfoot of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe first sale of park property to a resident was made in February,\r\n1886, when Dr. Morris H. Henry, Mr. Lorillard's personal physician,\r\npurchased Lot No. 101 on the map of Tuxedo Park. This was followed\r\nin March, the same year, by the purchase of Lot No. 120 by Allen T.\r\nRice, the editor of the _North American Review,_ and the same year\r\nLot No. 121 was sold to William Waldorf Astor, Lot No. 123 to\r\nPierre Lorillard and Lot. No. 103 to Travis C. Van Buren, all of\r\nwhich persons are now deceased, the land having in every instance\r\npassed into other hands.\r\n\r\nThat same year, Francis D. Carley, James L. Breese, Josephine Lee\r\nPrice, James Brown Potter, Margaret S. E. Cameron and Mary L. Barbey\r\nalso purchased land in the order named. Of these Mrs. Price, Mrs.\r\nBarbey and Mr. Potter still hold interests in the real estate.\r\n\r\nThe first person actually to take up his residence at Tuxedo with his\r\nfamily was Mr. Grenville Kane, who leased the cottage he subsequently\r\npurchased and is now the oldest resident of the park proper. Mrs.\r\nPrice and William Kent, in the order named, being the next arrivals.\r\n\r\nThus the park as a place of residence became an accomplished fact,\r\nthrough the indomitable pluck and energy of Mr. Lorillard. Each year\r\nhas shown a steady and substantial gain in residents. The present\r\nofficers of the association are: P. Lorillard, president; George\r\nGriswold, vice-president; George D. Findley, treasurer; and William\r\nKent, secretary.\r\n\r\nAs an organization the Tuxedo Club is very strong. The club book of\r\n1908 shows a membership of 374, of which seventy-seven were resident\r\nmembers. Among them are found the family names of those not only\r\nprominent in business and financial circles, but also who have been\r\nidentified with the society of the State since the earliest periods.\r\nThe club is self-supporting, has renewed its lease with the Tuxedo\r\nPark Association for a term of years, and bids fair to become a great\r\ncenter of social life.\r\n\r\nTUXEDO VALLEY.\r\n\r\nSo comprehensive was the scope of the original plan of development,\r\nthat a whole village was created at the time of the founding, near\r\nthe entrance gate, containing stores, cottages, and subsequently a\r\ntown hall, schoolhouses, churches, library, and a $30,000 hospital\r\nnow in course of construction.\r\n\r\nThe Tuxedo Stores Company was organized March, 1894. Each resident of\r\nthe park was invited to subscribe to the stock, and the company began\r\nbusiness April 1, 1894.\r\n\r\nThe Tuxedo electric light plant was organized in 1899, and is owned\r\nand controlled by the residents of Tuxedo.\r\n\r\n_St. Mary's-in-Tuxedo._--In 1887 Mr. Henry T. Barbey obtained from\r\nthe association a grant of land, on which he erected the first church\r\nbuilding at Tuxedo, since which time it has been greatly enlarged by\r\nadditions from time to time including a large parish house--until it\r\nhad grown into the present beautiful church edifice. It was\r\nconsecrated October 14, 1888, and the Rev. Mr. Colston placed in\r\ncharge. The present rector is the Rev. William Fitzsimon.\r\n\r\n_Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel._--The cornerstone of this church\r\nwas laid June, 1895. The edifice cost $7,000. Rev. James Quinn was\r\nthe first pastor. In July, 1899, the church and rectory were\r\ncompletely destroyed by fire. A year later it was rebuilt, and on\r\nSeptember 23, 1900, was solemnly dedicated by the Most Rev.\r\nArchbishop Corrigan.\r\n\r\nThe Tuxedo police force was organized May 1, 1886. John Pederson was\r\ncaptain until 1891, when he was succeeded by Gillmore O. Bush. The\r\nresidential part of the park is patrolled regularly day and night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William B. Royce]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF WALLKILL.\r\n\r\nBy William B. Royce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Wallkill is the second largest town in the county of\r\nOrange, and, exclusive of the area in the city of Middletown,\r\ncontains 38,030 acres, as shown by the equalization table of the\r\nboard of supervisors for the year 1906. This area would be\r\nconsiderably increased if an accurate estimate could be obtained of\r\nthe amount of land not included in farm and lot descriptions and\r\nbeing used for church, cemetery, school and road purposes.\r\n\r\nThe town is bounded northerly by Crawford and Montgomery, easterly by\r\nHamptonburgh, southerly by Goshen and Wawayanda, and westerly by\r\nMount Hope and the Shawangunk Kill, which separates it, for about\r\nhalf the distance, on its westerly border, from the town of\r\nMamakating, Sullivan County. The Wallkill River forms part of its\r\neasterly boundary, dividing it from the town of Hamptonburgh. This\r\nstream also passes through the southeast corner of the town, and is\r\nthe only large stream flowing within its borders. Both the Wallkill\r\nand Shawangunk Kill flow in a northerly direction and find their way\r\ninto the Hudson River at Rondout. The other streams in the town of\r\nWallkill are small; the principal ones being Monhagen Creek, flowing\r\nthrough the city of Middletown; the Bullhack, rising near Circleville\r\nand emptying into the Wallkill near Phillipsburgh; and the Mayunk,\r\nflowing through the easterly portion of the town and emptying into\r\nthe Wallkill in the town of Montgomery. Notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthere are no important streams, the town is well watered by small\r\nstreams and springs, so that there is never danger to agriculture\r\nfrom this source.\r\n\r\nThe topography of the town of Wallkill is very irregular, varying in\r\nelevation from 335 feet above sea level in the easterly portion of\r\nthe town along the Wallkill to 1,035 feet in the westerly, about\r\nthree miles west of the city of Middletown and about half a mile\r\nnorth of the old Mount Hope turnpike. All the principal ridges and\r\nvalleys of the town run in a northerly and southerly direction.\r\n\r\nEARLY CHANGES AND GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe precinct of Wallkill, of which the present town is the legal\r\nsuccessor, was erected December 17, 1743, by an act of the Colonial\r\nLegislature. The three towns of Crawford, Montgomery and Wallkill,\r\nand portions of Mount Hope and Hamptonburgh, were embraced in the\r\narea of this precinct. In 1772 the precinct of Hanover was erected,\r\nor set off, from the precinct of Wallkill, and included the towns of\r\nCrawford and Montgomery and a portion of Hamptonburgh, and, while it\r\nwas generally supposed that Wallkill became a new precinct, legally\r\nHanover was set off from the old precinct, and the statute directed\r\nthat the rest of the territory \"should remain\" the precinct of\r\nWallkill. It is also a fact that the town records of the precinct of\r\nWallkill were left with, and became a part of, the records of\r\nHanover, and, from the date of the separation, the precinct of\r\nWallkill opened a new record, which is still preserved. Up to the\r\ntime of the erection of the precinct of Hanover, the town or precinct\r\nmeetings were held for the whole precinct, including all territory\r\noriginally forming the precinct of Wallkill.\r\n\r\nThe first town meeting in the precinct of Wallkill, after the\r\ndivision, was held at the house of Samuel Watkins, April 7, 1772, and\r\nthe following is the record of the officers chosen:\r\n\r\nWilliam Dunn, clerk and supervisor; Benjamin Booth, James Wilkins,\r\nElijah Reeve, commissioners for regulating and laying out public\r\nhighways; Stephen Harlow, William Watkins, David Moore, commissioners\r\nfor laying out the money raised by act of Assembly on the highways;\r\nDavid Crawford, Moses Phillips, assessors; John McGarrah, John\r\nPatterson, constables and collectors; Abel Wells, George Booth,\r\npoor-masters; Jonathan Smith, Esq., Isaiah Vail, John Ketchum,\r\nBenjamin Vail, Jr., fence viewers and damage appraisers. Fences were\r\nto be four and one-half feet high, staked and ridered; five rails\r\nhigh or otherwise equivalent as the fence viewers shall judge.\r\n\r\nMany items of interest could be gleaned from these old records, one\r\nof the principal being the fact that many of the persons in Wallkill\r\nto-day, occupying prominent social, business and official positions,\r\nare the direct descendants of these sturdy pioneers of earlier days.\r\n\r\nThe construction and care of the roads then, as now, seemed to be one\r\nof the principal subjects in which the people were interested. In\r\norder to demonstrate this, and at the same time preserve the names of\r\nmany of those who then assumed the long-enduring business of road\r\nbuilding in Wallkill, we make the following quotations from the\r\nrecords:\r\n\r\n\"Precinct to be divided in three districts, viz: The east side of the\r\nWallkill, one; the west side, two, to be divided by the new northwest\r\nline.\"\r\n\r\n\"Samuel Watkins, from the Widow McBride's corner to Thomas Simeril's,\r\nand thence along the road to Campbell's bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"William Bodle, from Esquire Smith's to the Minisink road, and from\r\nthe schoolhouse on the road to Hezekiah Gale's; from thence to John\r\nMcGarrah's, and thence to the schoolhouse; to work also on David\r\nCrawford's road to the bridge one day.\"\r\n\r\n\"John Hill, from Esquire Smith's road along the Minisink road to the\r\nmiddle of Connor's bridge; also a piece of road leading from the\r\nMinisink road to Orange County.\"\r\n\r\n\"James Rogers, Jr., from the precinct line to the Widow McCord's\r\nnorth gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain William Faulkner, from his own house to Thomas Simeril's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Henry Savage, from the Widow McCord's north gate to Arzuble\r\nMcCurdy's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daniel Tears, from the precinct line to John McHenry's house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Edward Campbell, from the John McHenry's to Arzuble McCurdy's, and\r\nPeter McLaughlin, from the corner of Edward McNeal's lot to Phillips\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tilton Eastman, from Connor's bridge to the Pine Swamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stacy Beakes, from Minisink road to Dunning's road that leads to\r\nPine Swamp.\"\r\n\r\n\"George Smith, from the middle of the white-oak bridge to the top of\r\nthe round hill beyond Corey's.\"\r\n\r\n\"John Ketchum, from the top of round hill to the west end of the\r\nprecinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abraham Taylor and John Daily, Jr., from the white-oak bridge by\r\nElijah Reeve's to the precinct line.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was raised by direct taxation for the following purposes:\"\r\n\r\n                 \"L.

Presumably many of our taxpayers would\r\nprefer the olden days so far as taxes are concerned.\r\n\r\nSOME EARLY HISTORY.\r\n\r\nVery little is known of the aboriginal days of the town of Wallkill.\r\nWhile various tribes of Indians occupied different parts of Orange\r\nCounty, from the names of certain of the streams in the town of\r\nWallkill, it is evident that they made their home, at least part of\r\nthe time, in this town. However, outside of tradition and a few\r\nindividual cases of contact with them, which had very little, if any,\r\ninfluence on the future history of the town, nothing reliable is\r\nknown that would be of interest at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of the patenting of lands, now included within\r\nthe town of Wallkill, was some time before the year 1724, and seems\r\nto have been embraced in two patents, one known as the Minisink\r\nAngle, and the other a part of what is known as the John Evans\r\npatent. The latter tract was subsequently re-patented at dates\r\ncommencing December 14, 1724, and ending May 13, 1761. The actual\r\nsettlement of the town did not occur until about the close of the\r\nperiod mentioned, and therefore, Wallkill was not settled as early as\r\na number of the other towns in the county.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to refer to the assessment roll of the town of\r\nWallkill of to-day to find many property owners whose names are the\r\nsame as those of their ancestors who subdued the wilderness and made\r\nWallkill one of the most attractive and wealthy towns in the county.\r\nWhen we mention such names as Bull, Harlow, Borland, Wisner, Houston,\r\nCarpenter, Reeve, Mills, Green, Wickham, Connor, Mapes and Horton,\r\ntaken from the assessment rolls of to-day, we could almost imagine we\r\nwere reading a roll call of the names of the sturdy pioneers who\r\nsubdued the wilderness and caused the valleys of this town to blossom\r\nas the rose.\r\n\r\nPrevious histories of this town and the numerous writings of other\r\npersons have made all these facts so familiar that it would seem\r\nidle to burden these pages with any repetition of the history of the\r\nearly settlement of the town and its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samuel Wickham Mills, D.D.]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of settlement, during the entire Colonial period to the\r\nRevolutionary War, there was little of moment that happened here. The\r\nsettlements gradually progressed in different directions, but, as\r\nbefore stated, not as rapidly as in some other towns. During the\r\nRevolutionary War, a number of its citizens were with the army at\r\nvarious times, but the town, by its location, was far removed from\r\nthe din and strife of participation in any events of the struggle;\r\nno battles occurred within its limits, and it is not known that any\r\norganized bodies of the British or their allies ever set foot within\r\nits borders. From the close of the Revolutionary War until 1803,\r\nthere was a steady growth in population, so that the assessment roll\r\nfor that year contained 462 names of those who were assessed for\r\neither real or personal property, or both.\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 1799, the State Legislature passed an act for the\r\ngradual abolition of slavery, and a number of citizens recorded a\r\nformal act of freeing Negroes held by them. The first one of these\r\nseems to have been made in 1800, and is in the following form:\r\n\r\n\"I do hereby certify that I have manumitted and set free my Negro\r\nslave, Otis, as fully and amply as I am authorized by the act of the\r\nLegislature entitled, 'An act for the gradual abolition of slavery,'\r\npassed the 29th day of March, 1799.\"\r\n\r\n\"Given under my hand and seal this 1st day of November, 1800.\"\r\n\r\n                       \"Tabetha Borland.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar acts of manumission were entered by Jonathan Smith, Stephen\r\nSmith, Henry G. Wisner, John Wilkin, William Phillips and Israel\r\nWickham, and it is a fact that the descendants of these people,\r\nbearing in many cases the identical names, were the strongest\r\nopponents of slavery, and the most loyal supporters of the government\r\nduring the Civil War.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1828, the temperance question began to agitate the people\r\nof the town of Wallkill, possibly more thoroughly than it is doing in\r\nthe present day, for the reason that, in 1824, there were just three\r\ntimes as many taverns (as they were called in that day) within the\r\nlimits of the town as there are hotels at present (1908). Many of the\r\nquestions involved in the temperance agitation of that time are the\r\nchief object of argument at present, and we have only to quote a\r\nresolution passed at a meeting of the town of Wallkill, held in that\r\nyear, to show this fact conclusively:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, pauperism has increased in the town of Wallkill to an\r\nalarming extent; and whereas intemperance is one of the greatest\r\nprogressing causes, inasmuch as more than three-fourths of the\r\npaupers emanate directly or indirectly from that source, and whereas\r\ntippling-houses, dram-shops, and groceries have a direct tendency to\r\nincrease the evils; therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, (as the sense of this town meeting), That the board of\r\nexcise be requested to refuse granting licenses to those persons\r\nwhose principal object is to retail intoxicating liquors and not\r\nhaving suitable accommodations for public entertainment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, that the foregoing be entered on the records of said town\r\nand published in two newspapers printed in Goshen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dated Wallkill, this 1st day of April, 1828.\"\r\n\r\nThe town of Wallkill continued to grow steadily, without any change\r\nin territorial boundaries, until 1848, when the village of Middletown\r\nwas incorporated within its limits, but, outside of certain local\r\nmatters, such as schools, streets, police, and a few other minor\r\nmatters, the village continued to form a part of the town until the\r\nerection of the city of Middletown, in 1889. All the town officers\r\nwere elected to represent the village and town in all things,\r\nexcepting the purely local matters, applicable especially to the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nIN THE CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, in 1861, the fires of patriotism\r\nseemed to burn as brightly in the town of Wallkill and village of\r\nMiddletown as in any corresponding section of the country. Meetings\r\nwere called, resolutions adopted, and steps immediately taken to form\r\na company for the defense of the Union. Aid societies were\r\nestablished by the women, supplies sent forward to suffering\r\nsoldiers, and everything was done that love and patriotism could\r\nsuggest for the care of those in the army and for the preservation of\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nAs near as can be estimated, Wallkill and Middletown combined sent to\r\nthe front some 787 soldiers. Liberal bounties were paid to those who\r\nwent, either as volunteers or substitutes, and the best of care was\r\ntaken of the families of the absent soldiers. When we take into\r\nconsideration the fact that, at the beginning of the war, the\r\npopulation of the town of Wallkill and village of Middletown,\r\ncombined, was less than 7,000, it will be seen that more than, 10\r\nper cent. of the entire population proved its loyalty by going to the\r\nfront, and the percentage who went and never returned was far\r\ngreater than the proportion, in comparison to population. That\r\nWallkill proved its loyalty by devotion and blood, this record most\r\namply proves.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1879, the citizens of Wallkill and Middletown erected to\r\nthe memory of the soldiers of Wallkill, a most graceful and\r\nimpressive monument. It was first located at the junction of North\r\nand Orchard streets, but subsequently removed to Thrall Park, on the\r\ncorner of Wickham avenue and Grove street, which is a much better\r\nlocation than the original. Mrs. Thrall, who generously donated and\r\nbequeathed the money for the erection of Thrall Library and Thrall\r\nHospital, also gave the city the land for Thrall Park, which is\r\nsituated north of and adjoining the hospital.\r\n\r\nHAMLETS.\r\n\r\nThe present town of Wallkill contains no incorporated village, and\r\nonly four hamlets, which might be dignified by the name of village,\r\nas follows: Circleville, Howells, Scotchtown and Mechanicstown. The\r\nrest of the town is entirely devoted to agriculture, and, since the\r\nerection of the city of Middletown, has not shown any increase in\r\npopulation. Its farms are largely occupied by the owners, in many\r\ncases heirs and descendants of original and colonial possessors, and\r\nit possibly shows a less number of farms under rental than do many\r\nother towns in the county.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\nThere are three churches and one chapel at present in the town of\r\nWallkill. A Congregational church is located at Howells, and was\r\nincorporated under its present name on July 6, 1847. This church had\r\nexisted for many years previous to this, under other names, and at\r\ndifferent locations.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian church at Scotchtown was organized some time before\r\n1798, but the precise date seems to be unknown. The first official\r\nrecord that a church was regularly organized seems to be in the\r\nminutes of the Presbytery of Hudson, when, on April 19, 1798, Jacob\r\nMills and George Houston appeared as commissioners from the\r\nPresbyterian church in the town of Wallkill and requested that said\r\nchurch be taken under the care of the Presbytery, and that supplies\r\nmight be appointed them. This request was granted and the services of\r\nthe church continued, under supplies, until June 30, 1803, when Rev.\r\nMethuselah Baldwin became pastor. Previous, however, to the\r\nappearance of the commissioners before the Presbytery, a meeting had\r\nbeen held, on December 24, 1795, at the house of George Houston,\r\napparently for the organization of a church, and at this meeting it\r\nwas resolved that a subscription be opened for building a\r\nmeeting-house at the corner of the roads above the house of George\r\nHouston, and that the new congregation should be under the care of\r\nthe General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. This church was\r\nerected, enclosed and painted in 1797, and thus remained, without\r\nplastering, pews, pulpit or stoves, until 1806, when it was finished,\r\nat a cost of $515. This building was used for about fifty-seven\r\nyears, when it was succeeded by the present church edifice. The\r\nchurch was, for many years, a leading one in the Presbytery of\r\nHudson, and is still doing active work.\r\n\r\n_The Circleville Presbyterian Church_ was organized on January 4,\r\n1842, and became a part of the Presbytery of Hudson. Its house of\r\nworship was erected in 1842, and a large part of the expense of such\r\nerection seems to have been contributed by donations in the way of\r\nlabor, timber, lumber and mason work. The land, consisting of five\r\nacres, was donated by Samuel Bull, who, in addition to his gift of\r\nland, contributed much in labor, material and money, and to him the\r\ncommunity is largely indebted for benefits derived from this church\r\nthrough its past years and at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe chapel previously referred to was erected near Rockville through\r\nthe liberality of Robert A. Harrat and his neighbors in the immediate\r\nvicinity, and is used for Sunday-schools and special church services\r\nby clergymen from any denomination who desire to preach within its\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS.\r\n\r\nWallkill has excellent railroad facilities. The Erie runs through\r\nfrom Howells Depot, passing out at its southern border. The Ontario\r\n& Western comes in at the northwesterly end of the town, running\r\nthence in a general southeasterly direction to the city of\r\nMiddletown, thence easterly through the town of Wallkill, passing out\r\ninto the town of Hamptonburgh near Stony Ford. The Middletown &\r\nCrawford branch diverges from the Ontario & Western Railroad about\r\ntwo miles north of Middletown, passes through the town in a\r\nnortheasterly direction to the town of Crawford near Bullville and\r\nruns thence to Pine Bush. The Susquehanna & Western Railroad passes\r\ninto the town from the southerly border of the city of Middletown and\r\nruns in a southwesterly direction in the town of Wawayanda. In\r\naddition to the above, the Erie & Jersey Railroad Company is now\r\nbuilding a low-grade road which enters the town near Howells and runs\r\nin a general easterly direction through the town, passing about one\r\nmile north of the city of Middletown, thence leaving the town and\r\npassing into the town of Hamptonburgh in the vicinity of Stony Ford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Theo. D. Mills, M. D.]\r\n\r\nThere is also a trolley line owned by the Wallkill Transit Company,\r\nwhich is operated in the city of Middletown and extends from the\r\ncity, through the town of Wallkill, to the town of Goshen, and thence\r\nto the village of Goshen.\r\n\r\nAn example of the enterprise of the town of Wallkill was manifested\r\nwhen the question of raising money for the construction of the New\r\nYork & Oswego Midland Railroad came up in 1867. Its citizens, under\r\nthe wise leadership and guided by the excellent judgment of Senator\r\nHenry R. Low, Captain James N. Pronk, Elisha P. Wheeler, William J.\r\nGroo, and others, was induced to bond the town for the sum of three\r\nhundred thousand dollars and subscribe to the stock of the new road\r\nfor that amount. The bonds were issued for a period of twenty years,\r\nwith interest at the rate of seven per cent, per annum, payable\r\nsemi-annually, with a provision that after ten years an annual\r\nsinking fund of five per cent, of the total issue of bonds should be\r\nraised. Within a few years the New York & Oswego Midland Railroad\r\nCompany went into the hands of a receiver, and its stock became\r\ncomparatively worthless. The three-hundred thousand dollars of stock\r\nowned by the town was sold for $15,000. When the bonds matured in\r\n1888, William B. Royce, the sole railroad commissioner, had\r\naccumulated from the sinking fund, sale of stock, interest and other\r\nsources, the sum of $180,000, with which bonds to that amount were\r\npaid. To provide for the payment of the balance of said bonds,\r\namounting to $120,000, the railroad commissioner issued, under\r\nauthority of law, bonds to that amount, payable in installments, the\r\nlast of said bonds maturing on April 1, 1907, with interest payable\r\nsemi-annually, at the rate of three and one-half per cent, per annum.\r\nAs provided by the bonds, the last installment of principal and\r\ninterest was paid April 1, 1907, the town and city of Middletown\r\nhaving paid the whole of said principal sum by direct tax, excepting\r\nthe $15,000 for which the stock was sold. The New York, Ontario &\r\nWestern Railway Company was organized and took over the property of\r\nthe old New York & Oswego Midland Railroad Company. As a result of\r\nthe construction of this road, to which the town of Wallkill and\r\ncity of Middletown have contributed so largely, the railroad shops\r\nwere located at Middletown, which brought a very large influx to the\r\npopulation of the town and city, and added largely to their taxable\r\nvalue. It also resulted in building the road from Middletown to\r\nCornwall, and the extension of what was known as the Middletown,\r\nUnionville and Water Gap Railroad through to New York under the\r\noriginal name of the New Jersey Midland Railroad, which subsequently\r\nbecame the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad, thus giving\r\nMiddletown three direct lines of railroad to New York City, and\r\nmaking northern and western communications, which largely added to\r\nits transportation facilities.\r\n\r\nHIGHWAYS.\r\n\r\nThe highways of the town of Wallkill are in fair condition, and are\r\nmaintained under the money system. The town has a portion of three\r\nState roads; one branching off from the Middletown-Bloomingburg plank\r\nroad, about three miles north of Middletown, and running in a general\r\nnortherly direction to the town line of Crawford and thence to the\r\nvillage of Pine Bush. Another road starts from the southern corporate\r\nlimits of the city of Middletown and runs in a southerly direction to\r\nthe town line of Wawayanda, and thence to the village of Goshen. This\r\nroad branches off in a southwesterly direction in the town of\r\nWawayanda and extends to Unionville, and by another branch is being\r\nextended to Port Jervis. Another State road, known as the\r\nMiddletown-Cuddebackville road, starts from the northwesterly line of\r\nthe city of Middletown and runs through the town to the line of the\r\ntown of Mount Hope, thence through Mount Hope and Deer Park to\r\nCuddebackville. Under existing laws the State roads are in the first\r\ninstance maintained under direction of and at the expense of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. D. Mills]\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe town of Wallkill has seventeen school districts, in which are\r\nmaintained the usual form of district schools under the State law.\r\nThese are being gradually improved under the efficient system of\r\nState supervision, but are not yet at the standard to which they\r\nshould be raised.\r\n\r\nMIDDLETOWN.\r\n\r\nThe precise time when the first settlement was made in this village\r\nis uncertain, though it is believed to have been shortly after the\r\nerection of the town. John Green purchased some land of Delancey, a\r\npatentee under the crown of Great Britain, and that purchase included\r\nland in the southern part of the village and the ground where the\r\nFirst Congregational church now stands. Mr. Green donated the lot for\r\nthe purpose of having a house of worship erected. When the citizens\r\nassembled to put up the frame of the old Congregational church, it\r\nwas concluded that the locality should have a name. \"What shall it\r\nbe? There is Dolsontown on the south, Goshen on the east, Scotchtown\r\non the north, and a locality not defined, on the west, called\r\nShawangunk. We will call it Middletown, it being the center.\" In\r\n1829, the name of the village was changed to South Middletown to\r\nprevent confusion in the transmission of mail matter, there being\r\nanother place styled \"Middletown\" north of Newburgh, but in 1849 the\r\nprefix of \"South\" was left off.\r\n\r\nThe Minisink road which passes through the city of Middletown is\r\nmentioned by a Mr. Clinton, a surveyor employed by the owner of lot\r\nNo. 35 of the Minisink Angle, as early as 1742, and the second store\r\nin Middletown was started by Isaiah Vail at a place called Monhagen,\r\nopposite the white oak bridge on the old Minisink road, near the\r\nwesterly limits of the present city of Middletown. The first store in\r\nMiddletown was kept by Abel Woodhull, previous to the place being\r\ncalled Middletown.\r\n\r\nThe western portion of Middletown was included in lot No. 36 in the\r\nMinisink Angle, owned by Delancey, and as he espoused the Royalist\r\ncause his land, except what was sold to Mr. Green before the\r\nRevolution, was confiscated by the State of New York. Three\r\nappraisers were appointed by the State to put a value on the land,\r\ntwo of whom were Israel Wickham and Henry Wisner. It is stated that\r\nan earnest debate occurred on the subject of valuation, whether to\r\ncall it six shillings or a dollar per acre. Mr. Wickham insisted that\r\nit would never be worth a dollar, so it was put down at six shillings\r\nan acre. The land confiscated takes in the western portion of the\r\nvillage and present city, and includes the real estate formerly owned\r\nby John B. Hanford, Henry Little and George Houston. Part of this\r\nland could not now be bought for $10,000 an acre.\r\n\r\nThe New York & Erie Railroad seems to have been built on the\r\ninstallment plan in the county of Orange; first to Monroe, then to\r\nChester, then to Goshen, and finally by large contributions from the\r\npeople of Middletown, it was extended to that place. The building of\r\nthis road seemed to give an impetus to the business of the village\r\nand induced manufacturers to locate there, which soon made it one of\r\nthe most flourishing villages in southern New York.\r\n\r\nThe actual incorporation of the village did not occur until April 7,\r\n1848, when the preliminary proceedings in regard to the incorporation\r\nwere approved by Judge D. W. Bates. The first president of the\r\nvillage was Stacey Beakes, and associated with him as trustees were\r\nCoe Dill, William Hoyt, Israel Hoyt, Israel O. Beattie and Daniel C.\r\nDusenberry. John B. Friend was clerk. Of the above named trustees,\r\nDaniel C. Dusenberry is still living (1908).\r\n\r\nThe growth of Middletown has always been gradual, and it has never\r\nbeen what might be called a \"boom town.\" In 1807 the population was\r\nforty-five; in 1838 it had increased to 433; in 1848, at the time of\r\nits incorporation, it had increased to 1,360; and in 1857, to 2,190.\r\nAt the time of its incorporation as a city, in 1888, its population\r\nhad increased to 11,977, and at the close of 1907 it was about\r\n16,000.\r\n\r\nThe post-office in the village of Middletown was first established on\r\nthe 22nd of October, 1816. Stacey Beakes was appointed the first\r\npostmaster and held the office for about ten years. The first\r\nquarter's receipts in 1817, as rendered by the postmaster, were\r\n$0.69; in 1826, the receipts had risen to $16.12 a quarter; and in\r\n1854, to $257.79. The annual receipts of the Middletown post-office\r\nare now upwards of $50,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles H. Smith.]\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Middletown were always ambitious for its growth, and\r\nin all that was done, the future as well as the present, interests of\r\nthe village were carefully looked after. Manufacturers were induced\r\nto locate there, and the village, and afterward the city, has always\r\nbeen recognized as a manufacturing center for this part of the State.\r\nSome of the largest manufactories in the old village of Middletown\r\nwere the Monhagen Saw Works, Eagle File Works, Matthews Brothers'\r\nCarpet Bag Factory, Draper's Hat Factory, Babcock's Hat Works, and a\r\nlarge tannery, which was afterward merged in the leather manufactory\r\nof Howell-Hinchman Company. As before mentioned, the New York,\r\nOntario & Western Railway Company located its shops here, and from\r\nthat time, the village and city have had a steady growth.\r\n\r\nCHURCHES.\r\n\r\nMiddletown as a village and city has always been well supplied with\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nThe first, the _Congregational Church,_ was organized June 10, 1785,\r\nand incorporated August 12, 1786, and so far as organization and\r\nincorporation are concerned, it is the oldest church in Middletown.\r\n\r\n_The first Presbyterian Church_ of Middletown, as such, was organized\r\nMarch 31, 1828.\r\n\r\n_The Methodist Episcopal Church_ of Middletown effected a legal\r\norganization on July 11, 1838.\r\n\r\n_Grace Episcopal Church_ was incorporated on February 18, 1845.\r\n\r\n_The First Baptist Church_ filed its certificate of incorporation\r\nOctober 28, 1849.\r\n\r\n_The Second Presbyterian Church_ (now Westminster church) was\r\nincorporated December 5, 1854.\r\n\r\n_The Primitive Baptist Church_ of Middletown was incorporated May\r\n29, 1871.\r\n\r\n_The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church_ was incorporated\r\nNovember 20, 1861.\r\n\r\n_St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church_ was established in 1866.\r\n\r\n_Calvary Baptist Church_ was incorporated in 1902.\r\n\r\n_North Congregational Church_ was incorporated in 1890.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church_ (Universalist) was incorporated in 1897.\r\n\r\n_St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church_ (German) was incorporated\r\nin 1897.\r\n\r\n_Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church_ was incorporated in 1875.\r\n\r\n_Faith Mission_ was incorporated in 1889.\r\n\r\n_The Christian Science Church_ was incorporated in 1903.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that the churches of Middletown\r\naverage one to every 1,000 people of the present population.\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe school system of Middletown was originated by the holding of a\r\nmeeting April 6, 1813, to take steps to comply with the statute of\r\n1812, for the organization of the common school system of the State.\r\nThe first commissioners elected were William Hurtin, Jacob Dunning\r\nand Benjamin Woodward. In 1844 a system of supervision by town\r\nsuperintendents was inaugurated. Previous to that several citizens\r\nwere selected who decided upon the qualifications of the teacher.\r\nJohn G. Wilkin, afterward county judge of Orange County, was the\r\nfirst town superintendent of Wallkill, which included the village of\r\nMiddletown. About the year 1856 a law was passed providing for the\r\nelection of superintendents for assembly districts, thus doing away\r\nwith the town system, and this system has ever since been continued.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, 1841, a meeting was held to initiate the\r\nwork of founding Wallkill Academy. It was started as a private\r\nenterprise, stock to the amount of $3,656.75 was subscribed by 115\r\nstockholders, the shares being $5.00 each. Application was made to\r\nthe Legislature for an act of incorporation, which was passed in May,\r\n1841. The building was completed in October, 1842, and soon\r\nthereafter school sessions were opened, the first teacher being Rev.\r\nPhineas Robinson, who remained in charge for two years. For a number\r\nof years Wallkill Academy was continued under the plan of its first\r\nincorporation, but subsequently passed over to the village of\r\nMiddletown as a part of its school system. The school system of the\r\nvillage of Middletown was always well managed and excellent results\r\nwere attained. This system was afterward merged in the city school\r\nsystem upon the incorporation of the city of Middletown in 1888.\r\n\r\nThe management is now under a board of education consisting of nine\r\nmembers, with superintendent of schools. There are now eight schools\r\nin the educational system of Middletown. The high school was erected\r\non the site formerly occupied by the Wallkill Academy, and is a very\r\nimposing building with all modern facilities and conveniences. It\r\nemploys thirteen teachers in the academic department, and eight in\r\nthe grammar grades. The seven primary schools are located in various\r\nparts of the city, so as to accommodate the pupils, but upon\r\ngraduation in the primary grades all of the pupils are promoted to\r\nthe high school in its various grades.\r\n\r\nThe free public library of Middletown, known as the Thrall Library\r\nBuilding, is architecturally an ornament to the city, and is fitted\r\nup in the most modern style for library purposes. The lot was\r\nformerly used as a location for the village school. Mrs. S.\r\nMaretta Thrall left a legacy of $30,000 to the city, with which the\r\nlibrary was built. Mrs. Thrall, by her liberality, provided\r\nMiddletown with a library of which its citizens are justly proud,\r\nand erected for herself a monument in our city and in the hearts of\r\nits people which will be as enduring as time. The library at present\r\ncontains 10,500 volumes. The legacy bequeathed by Mrs. Thrall was to\r\nbe used exclusively for the building, and was so used.\r\n\r\nCHARITABLE AND BENEVOLENT ORGANIZATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1880, the matter of establishing a Children's Home for\r\nOrange County was brought up in the board of supervisors. A\r\ncommittee, consisting of the Hon. William H. Clark, Selah E. Strong\r\nand William B. Royce, was appointed to take the matter under\r\nconsideration and report. After a careful investigation and\r\nexamination of a large number of properties, the committee reported\r\nthat in its judgment the property known as the Israel O. Beattie\r\nproperty in the village of Middletown was better adapted for the\r\npurpose than any other property that had been brought to the notice\r\nof the committee. The property, at the time, was owned by the Mutual\r\nLife Insurance Company of the city of New York, and after\r\nnegotiations, a price was fixed by the company at $8,000. The price\r\nwas approved by the board and the committee was ordered to purchase\r\nthe property, which was subsequently done. The sum of $2,000 was\r\nappropriated for the use of the committee in making such necessary\r\nrepairs and changes as might be deemed necessary to fit the property\r\nfor immediate use. The committee, having completed its duties,\r\nreported to the board on the 21st of November, 1881, that its work\r\nwas completed and that there had been expended $9,910.05, leaving a\r\nbalance of $89.95 in the hands of the committee.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the making of this report, the property had been turned\r\nover to the county superintendent of the poor, and it was formally\r\nopened on February 7, 1881. On the first day of January, 1882,\r\nforty-four children were being cared for in the home. This number has\r\nfluctuated during the intervening years, sometimes the number of\r\nchildren being as low as sixteen, and at other times approximating\r\nthe original number reported.\r\n\r\nThe Orange County Home for Aged Women is located at No. 27 South\r\nstreet, in the city of Middletown, and like the Children's Home, is\r\nnot limited to the city of Middletown with regard to the territory\r\nfrom which its inmates are received. It was incorporated in 1884, the\r\nidea emanating from the fertile brain of Dr. Julia E. Bradner. The\r\nhome now has become a well-known institution, not only in the city of\r\nMiddletown, but in the county of Orange.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to realize that Thrall Hospital, so much an integral\r\npart of the civic life of Middletown to-day, was not dreamed of a\r\nquarter of a century since. It is not an easy matter to make plain to\r\nthe lay mind just what is behind the bald statistic, \"One\r\ntyphoid--discharged.\" Statistics may number the bandages and weigh\r\nout the drugs, but they never take reckoning of the anxieties, the\r\nheartaches, that broad utilitarianism which under the name of the\r\nMiddletown Hospital Association began its beneficent work.\r\n\r\nIt was twenty years ago last November (1907) that Dr. Julia E.\r\nBradner called together, at her residence, a few of the women of\r\nMiddletown to discuss the project of having a hospital in their own\r\nhome town.\r\n\r\nAt the first informal meeting in November, 1887, nine women, led on\r\nby the indomitable spirit of Dr. Julia E. Bradner, voted to have a\r\ncharter legally drawn and to meet again at her home, on Orchard\r\nstreet, on the 22nd of November.\r\n\r\nThe charter was presented at this second meeting and signed before\r\nNotary Henry W. Wiggins by the following women: Julia E. Bradner,\r\npresident; Ella S. Hanford, first vice-president; Lutie M. Clemson,\r\nsecond vice-president; Clara S. Finn, treasurer; Harriet L. Clark,\r\nsecretary; Sarah Orr Sliter, Jennie E. Prior, Frances W. Wilcox,\r\nFlorence Horton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles A. Evans.]\r\n\r\nThe organization effected on this November day and incorporated\r\nDecember 6, of the same year, was named \"The Middletown Hospital\r\nAssociation,\" its object \"to build and maintain a hospital in the\r\nvillage of Middletown.\"\r\n\r\nThe day of the second meeting was big in history, for not only was\r\nthe matter of the charter settled, but an advisory board of\r\nphysicians was elected, consisting of William E. Eager, M.D.;\r\nWilliam H. Dorrance, M.D.; Selden H. Talcott, M.D.; Burke Pillsbury,\r\nM.D.; and Ira S. Bradner, M.D.--all of whom have passed away.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1891, seeing the need and the opportunity to supply\r\nthat need, Mrs. S. Maretta Thrall gave to the association the lot on\r\nthe south side of what is now Thrall Park. Plans were made for a\r\nbuilding to cost over $13,000, but their execution would have been\r\nput off indefinitely had not Mrs. Thrall come forward with a gift of\r\nmoney sufficient to cover the cost of the planned building, making,\r\nwith the estimated value of the lot, a total gift of over $16,000.\r\nWork on the foundation was begun immediately.\r\n\r\nThe association, which in various ways, during the four years which\r\nelapsed after the foundation was laid, had raised $5,000, now used\r\nthat amount to furnish and equip the building in a practical and\r\nup-to-date manner. On the tenth day of May, one year after the gift\r\nof the lot, the hospital, having a capacity of twenty-six beds, was\r\nthrown open for the reception of patients.\r\n\r\nMIDDLETOWN STATE HOMEOPATHIC HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nNearly forty years ago, or, to be exact, in 1869, several of the\r\ncitizens of what was then the village of Middletown decided that a\r\nhospital for the insane was needed in this vicinity. Funds were\r\ncollected and a farm was purchased on the western border of the\r\nvillage for a site for an asylum, as such institutions were then\r\ncalled. Dr. George F. Foote endeavored to raise money by subscription\r\nfor a private asylum. To this end $75,000 were subscribed, the amount\r\nexpended for a site and to build part of the institution, all of\r\nwhich was finally accepted by the commonwealth as a free-will\r\noffering from a comparatively few generous subscribers.\r\n\r\nThe first appropriation by the State for the institution was made in\r\n1870. The original board of trustees numbered twenty-one, appointed\r\nby the Governor. The first superintendent, Dr. Foote, having\r\nresigned, Dr. Henry R. Stiles was appointed in his stead. He served\r\nuntil February 9, 1877, and then resigned. He was succeeded by the\r\nlate Selden H. Talcott, who served until his death in 1902, when the\r\npresent incumbent, Dr. Maurice C. Ashley, was appointed to succeed\r\nhim, and is now in charge of the institution.\r\n\r\nAmong the early trustees, who were residents of Orange County, may be\r\nrecalled the well-known names of Daniel Thompson, John G. Wilin,\r\nMoses D. Stivers, James G. Graham, Henry R. Low, Elisha P. Wheeler,\r\nDr. Joshua A. Draper, James B. Hulse, James H. Norton, Nathaniel W.\r\nVail, and Uzal T. Hayes.\r\n\r\nThe hospital was incorporated in 1869, opened for the reception of\r\npatients on the 20th of April, 1874, and the first patient was\r\nadmitted May 7, 1874.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the present magnitude of this great public\r\ncharity, it seems fitting that a few figures should go on record\r\nwhere they will be permanently preserved.\r\n\r\nThe farm and grounds comprise nearly 300 acres, on which there are\r\nthirty buildings; the value of the real and personal property is over\r\n$1,500,000; the present annual expenses for all purposes, excepting\r\nthe new building, are about $245,000, of which nearly $60,000 are\r\nreceived from private and reimbursing patients; about $110,000 is\r\nrequired for salaries and wages. Since the opening of the\r\ninstitution, over 7,000 patients have been received and treated. Of\r\nthis number 2,600 have been discharged recovered and returned to\r\ntheir homes and to society, and 900 others have been sufficiently\r\nrestored or improved to enable them to return to their families. The\r\nnumber of patients under treatment at the present time is 1,350.\r\n\r\nThe present normal capacity of the hospital for patients is 1,222.\r\nBuildings are now under construction for about 550 more patients and\r\nthe necessary employees, making a total capacity for 1,850 patients\r\nand 450 employees.\r\n\r\nThe hospital district comprises Orange, Sullivan, Ulster and Rockland\r\nCounties, but those desiring homeopathic treatment are received from\r\nany part of the State.\r\n\r\nDuring all the years, the hospital has been conducted upon\r\nhomeopathic principles, following strictly the practice and\r\nprinciples of homeopathy in the selection of medicines and treatment\r\nof patients. This is a compliance with the law under which the\r\nhospital was first incorporated, and the results, in all respects,\r\nwould seem to warrant the continuance of the present form of\r\ntreatment and management.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the law, a training school for nurses and\r\nattendants has been established and maintained for some years with\r\nthe most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nA few years since all the asylums were placed under State control,\r\nand a board of local managers with modified duties took the place of\r\nthe old boards of trustees.\r\n\r\nThe board of managers of the asylum, as at present constituted,\r\nconsists of William H. Rogers of Middletown, N. Y., president; Ira L.\r\nCase, of Middletown, N. Y., secretary; Newbold Morris, of New York\r\nCity, N. Y., Miss Alice Larkin, New York City; Mrs. Harriet A.\r\nDillingham, New York City; George B. Adams, Middletown, N. Y.; and\r\nJames B. Carson, Middletown, N. Y. The attorney for the hospital is\r\nWilliam B. Royce, of Middletown, N. Y.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThe city of Middletown is located on the Erie, the New York, Ontario\r\n& Western and the Susquehanna & Western railroads, about sixty-seven\r\nmiles from New York City, and is the legal successor of the village\r\nof Middletown, in the county of Orange. The city was incorporated by\r\nan act of the Legislature of the State of New York, known as Chapter\r\n535 of the Laws of 1888, and John E. Iseman became its first mayor.\r\nThe city, as now incorporated, contains 2,330-1/2 acres.\r\n\r\nThe city is divided into four wards. The general city officers are:\r\nA Mayor, Robert Lawrence, now holding the office; president of the\r\ncommon council, two aldermen from each ward, city clerk and\r\ncollector, city treasurer, corporation counsel, city engineer and\r\nsurveyor, superintendent of streets, recorder, two justices of the\r\npeace, and three assessors. Each ward also elects one supervisor, the\r\nduties of whose office are the same as those of town supervisors.\r\n\r\nMiddletown has a most excellent and efficient fire department, of\r\nwhich Charles Higham is chief. The force, as now organized, consists\r\nof one hook and ladder company, truck drawn by horses; five hose\r\ncompanies, two of them having chemical wagons drawn by horses; one\r\nengine company, new steamer drawn by horses. The city has a complete\r\nsystem of electric fire alarms, with forty-two boxes in service.\r\n\r\nMiddletown has about forty-seven regularly organized charitable,\r\nbenevolent, fraternal and social organizations and clubs, exclusive\r\nof labor-organizations, societies and organizations connected with\r\nits railroads. Of the latter there are nine, and of the labor\r\norganizations, twenty.\r\n\r\nA fine State armory is located here, which is the headquarters of the\r\nFirst Battalion, First Regiment, N. G. N. Y., A. E. Mclntyre, Major,\r\ncommanding. This armory is also the home of Company I (24th Separate\r\nCompany), First Regiment, N. G. N. Y., of which Abraham L. Decker is\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nThere are two Grand Army Posts in Middletown, viz: General Lyon Post,\r\nNo. 266; Captain William A. Jackson Post, No. 301.\r\n\r\nMiddletown has a very efficient Business Men's Association, which was\r\nincorporated November 20, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe banking interests of Middletown are represented by the following\r\nbanks: First National Bank, capital $100,000; Merchants' National\r\nBank, capital $100,000; Orange County Trust Company, capital\r\n$100,000; and the Middletown Savings Bank. These institutions are all\r\nin a healthy and prosperous condition and have, in the aggregate,\r\ndeposits amounting to about the sum of $8,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere are, in addition to the above, thirty-five incorporated\r\ncompanies in Middletown, representing manufacturing, mercantile,\r\nmechanical and financial enterprises. The largest employers of labor\r\nare the Borden's Condensed Milk Company, the New York, Ontario &\r\nWestern Railway Company shops, Howell-Hinchman Company, and the\r\nUnion Hat Company.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery grounds of the Hillside Cemetery Corporation, formerly\r\nHillside Cemetery Association, are located in the southwest part of\r\nthe city. The cemetery had many natural advantages from contour of\r\nthe land, virgin forests and running streams. To these have been\r\nadded about twelve miles of macadamized roads and drives, with\r\ngracefully curving paths and winding walks. A great deal of shrubbery\r\nand many flowering plants have been set out and in the summer the\r\nscene is a most lovely one. Surely Hillside Cemetery is a beautiful\r\nresting place for the dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Samuel C. Howell.]\r\n\r\nMiddletown has a most complete water system supplied by three\r\nreservoirs, located in the towns of Wallkill and Mount Hope, and\r\nnamed respectively, Monhagen, Highland and Shawangunk. All water for\r\ndomestic use is thoroughly filtered before being conveyed to the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe city has several miles of well paved streets, and is lighted by\r\nboth gas and electricity.\r\n\r\nThe telephone system consists of two companies. The Orange County\r\nTelephone Company has about 1,600 telephones in use, and also does\r\nthe long-distance business in the city for the Hudson River Telephone\r\nCompany. The Middletown Telephone Company has about a score of\r\nsubscribers in the city. It also has connection with several outside\r\nindependent companies.\r\n\r\nWith its location, financial ability, numerous business enterprises,\r\nits many social, benevolent, charitable and religious associations\r\nand institutions, its splendid school system, and with the\r\nenterprise, energy and business ability of its citizens, the\r\nMiddletown of to-day is only a beginning of the greater Middletown\r\nwhich will occupy this central part of Orange County in the years to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the history of the town of Wallkill were an easy task, and\r\nso saying is to speak in the highest praise of the town. Its course\r\nhas been peaceful, quiet, serene; its politics have never been\r\ninfected by scandal and corruption; the red glare of warfare--aboriginal\r\nor otherwise--has not shone athwart its pages; it has been a history\r\nin which the husbandman has dominated the scene and has been the\r\ncentral actor. Agriculture has been the mainstay of a people pious and\r\nGod-fearing, the descendants of those sturdy New England and Long\r\nIsland ancestors, who built the meeting-house and the school as soon\r\nas ever the settlement was made.\r\n\r\nWe dwellers in the Wallkill of to-day have every reason to be\r\nthankful that our history has been what it has; if it has lacked\r\nromance or excitement, it has likewise abounded in a peace that has\r\nmeant prosperity.\r\n\r\nOf late years the flood of immigration has sent its waves to our\r\nthresh-olds, and we find in our villages, on our farms, and toiling\r\nalong our railroads the children of Italy, of Hungary, of Austria, of\r\nRussia and the more remote East. What the picture will be a century\r\nhence, what sort of an amalgamation will have taken place, we cannot\r\nforesee. Certain it is that, if he is to remain with us, we must\r\neducate the alien, teach him our ways, prepare him for citizenship,\r\nand do all we can for him morally and intellectually, and that will\r\nsurely involve amalgamation. At any rate, this is a force that is\r\nbound to change our town's history, in the next hundred years, from\r\nanything that has gone before it. We should face the problem--meet it\r\nwith those most forcible of weapons, Education and Law.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, acting the role of prophet is not difficult. Wallkill's\r\nlines have been cast in pleasant places and will probably so continue\r\nto be cast. We anticipate nothing marvelous, look forward to naught\r\nphenomenal, expect no revolutions. Our townspeople will pursue the\r\neven tenor of their way on their pleasant farms and in their quiet\r\nvillages; they will know neither the bleak necessities of poverty nor\r\nthe anxieties of extreme wealth; all will be medium, which is the\r\nhappiest state of all. We are content with that. Our Wallkill is well\r\nbeloved; we would not trade it for anything different or more\r\nbrilliant; we would have it as it has been, not meaning stagnation,\r\nof course, yet not longing for the \"boom\" which newer and less firmly\r\nestablished and less well-grounded communities are forever invoking.\r\n\r\nWallkill, in many ways, realizes one's ideal of a rural\r\ntownship--well governed, knowing neither financial extreme, and with\r\na people contented, and at peace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ferdinand V. Sanford]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF WARWICK.\r\n\r\nBy Ferdinand V. Sanford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe derivation of Warwick, according to Mr. Thomas Kemp, mayor of\r\nWarwick, England, who has written a \"History of Warwick and Its\r\nPeople,\" is from the Saxon \"Wara\" which in that tongue signifies\r\ninhabitants, and \"wic\"--a town or castle, or hamlet, a bank or crook\r\nof a river. So that Warawic, or Warwick, signifies no more than the\r\ninhabitants of the town or castle upon the bank of the river. Other\r\nSaxon forms of the name found are Werhica, Wyrengewyk, Woerincwic,\r\nand Weringwic.\r\n\r\nThe history of our Warwick from the earliest times has been written\r\nby Eager and Ruttenber in their publications--that of the last-named\r\nwriter coming down to the year 1880.\r\n\r\nEARLY SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe present sketch is intended rather to supplement these earlier\r\naccounts than to re-write all of the past history, by recording\r\nprincipally the events which have occurred since 1880.\r\n\r\nThe town or township of Warwick was erected from the precinct of\r\nGoshen in 1788, and derived its name from the plantation of Benjamin\r\nAske, one of the original grantees of the Wawayanda patent. Upon the\r\nsub-division of the patent among twelve patentees, Aske's share was\r\na tract nearly in the form of a parallelogram, which extended from\r\nWickham's or Clark's Lake, on the northeast, to the farm now owned by\r\nTownsend W. Sanford, on the southwest, with an average width of a\r\nmile, and containing 2,200 acres of land. Aske named this tract,\r\n\"Warwick,\" from which fact it is supposed that he came from\r\nWarwickshire, England. The date of the Wawayanda patent is March 5,\r\n1702-1703, which was the peculiar style of writing year date a\r\ncouple of centuries ago. The document is signed by the twelve\r\nchiefs, all making their mark in the presence of witnesses, one of\r\nthem Chuckhass, the chief who lived in this town and for whom Chuck's\r\nHill is named. This patent embraced at that time practically all of\r\nOrange County as it existed in 1703.\r\n\r\nBy deed dated February 28, 1719, Aske sold to Lawrence Decker,\r\nyeoman, for 50 pounds, 100 acres, in the deed described as \"being\r\npart of the 2,200 acres of land, called Warwick,\" showing that\r\nprevious to that date Aske had bestowed the name of Warwick upon his\r\ntract. Later deeds to Thomas Blaine and Thomas DeKay contain similar\r\nrecitals.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers of Warwick were principally English families who came\r\nhither from Long Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Among them we\r\nfind the names of Armstrong, Baird, Benedict, Blaine, Bradner, Burt,\r\nDeKay, Decker, Demarest, Ketchum, Knapp, McCambley, Post, Roe, Sayer,\r\nSly, Sanford, Welling, Wheeler, Wisner, Wood and Van Duzer. Most of\r\nthese settlers have left descendants who still live in the town or\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution there were a few Tories near Warwick, but the\r\nmajority of the people were loyal to the country of their adoption,\r\nand many of them enlisted for service.\r\n\r\nJohn Hathorn, colonel of the Warwick and Florida regiment, Captains\r\nCharles Beardsley, John Minthorn, Henry Wisner, Jr., Abram Dolson,\r\nJr., John Norman, Henry Townsend, Nathaniel Elmer, John Saver;\r\nLieutenants Richard Welling, Samuel Lobdell, Nathaniel Ketchum,\r\nGeorge Vance, Peter Bartholf, Matthew Dolson, John Hopper, John\r\nDeBow, Anthony Finn, John Popino, Jr., Richard Bailey, John Kennedy,\r\nJohn Wood, and many others rendered valuable services during the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nWhile New York City was in the hands of the British, the most\r\ntraveled road between the Hudson River and the Delaware ran through\r\nWarwick. It is said that Washington passed through Warwick twice\r\nduring the war, and was entertained by Colonel Hathorn at the Pierson\r\nE. Sanford stone house near the village, on one of these occasions,\r\nat least.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the Revolution there were not more than thirty\r\nhouses in the village. In 1765 Daniel Burt built the shingle house,\r\nnow owned by Mrs. Sallie A. F. Servin, the oldest house in the\r\nvillage. In 1766 Francis Baird built the stone house now owned by\r\nWilliam B. Sayer, which was at one time used as a tavern, and in\r\nsome of the old maps Warwick is called \"Baird's Tavern.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James W. Knapp.]\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nThe town of Warwick is the largest in area of any of the towns of the\r\ncounty, containing 61,763 acres, or nearly double that of any of the\r\nothers, and being a little more than one-eighth of the area of the\r\nwhole county. Its assessed valuation of real and personal property in\r\n1906, was $2,863,010. The taxes levied upon that valuation for last\r\nyear were $22,745.12. Population according to State census of 1905\r\nwas 6,691.\r\n\r\nWithin the last generation the town has greatly improved its public\r\nhighways and bridges. With the advent of the bicycle, automobile and\r\nother motor vehicles, the demand for better road facilities has been\r\nfelt, and this demand has been and is now being supplied. Under the\r\nState law providing for the construction and improvement of the\r\nhighways at the joint expense of the State and county, the sum of\r\n$15,387.40 has been expended by the county, and the additional sum of\r\n$1,602.60 by the State, up to the year 1905, for acquisition of\r\nrights of way, engineering and cost of construction of 4.67 miles of\r\nroad from Florida to Warwick, known as Road No. 93, so that under the\r\ngood roads law (Chap. 115, Laws 1898) we have nearly five miles of\r\nfinished work done. Plans have also been approved by the county and\r\nits share of the cost appropriated for the building of 6.92 miles of\r\nroad from Warwick to Greenwood Lake at a total estimated cost of\r\n$54,250, which will undoubtedly be built as soon as the Legislature\r\nmakes appropriation for the State's share of the cost.\r\n\r\nSince 1883 the town has constructed several new iron bridges, viz: on\r\nthe east arm of Greenwood Lake, at Main, South, Lake, Elm and Bank\r\nstreets in the village of Warwick; also at Florida, Kimball's Point,\r\nGarners' Island across the Pochuck Creek, one between the towns of\r\nGoshen and Warwick, and one between the towns of Minisink and\r\nWarwick; also at Bellvale and New Milford, these substantial\r\nstructures replacing the old wooden bridges of the past. An elevated\r\nbridge across the tracks of the Lehigh and Hudson River Railway\r\nCompany was constructed to avoid the grade crossing at Stone Bridge\r\nat the joint expense of the railway company and the town, costing\r\nnearly $8,000, of which the town's share was one-quarter of the whole\r\ncost, made a most desirable improvement in this part of the town.\r\n\r\nThe town constructed a new road along the east side of Greenwood\r\nLake in 1889, the land being donated by Alexander Brandon, trustee,\r\nand others, to the town, and the latter building the same at a cost\r\nof over $7,000. This improvement opens up a large tract of land for\r\nbuilding purposes, the road extending to State line of New York and\r\nNew Jersey.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, by a vote of the taxpayers, a change was made in the manner\r\nof working the highways from the labor to the money system. Under the\r\nold system something over 5,000 days would be assessed for labor, but\r\na considerable portion would never be worked and in consequence our\r\nhighways would suffer. Under the present method the sum of $5,593 was\r\nexpended by the town in 1906, in cash upon our highways, and the\r\nadditional sum of $2,000 State aid, with uniformly better results\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nThe total mileage of public roads is nearly 200 in the town, and the\r\nsum of $25 per mile was expended upon every mile in that year and\r\nadditional sums of $10 per mile upon those roads more frequently\r\ntraveled.\r\n\r\nThis amount was for all the road districts outside of the\r\nincorporated village of Warwick, which is a separate road district\r\nmaintained by the corporation. The valuation for 1907 was $1 of tax\r\nfor every $300 of assessed value.\r\n\r\nTown boards of health have been maintained since 1881 and consist of\r\nthe supervisor, town clerk, justices of the peace, a citizen member\r\nand a physician, known as the health officer. Rules and regulations\r\ngoverning the proper observance of health are published each year by\r\nthis official body, and prompt action taken in case of any outbreak\r\nof disease, and measures instituted to control and prevent the spread\r\nof the same. As a result of the labors of these organizations and\r\nthose in the incorporated villages of our towns, the public health\r\nhas been safeguarded, and no serious epidemics have been experienced.\r\n\r\nThe town has seventeen separate school districts, where the common\r\nschool is maintained, and two union free schools at Florida and\r\nWarwick, under the supervision of the Regents of the University at\r\nAlbany. In these latter schools our young people are graduated,\r\nprepared for the different walks of life, and many entering colleges\r\nto prosecute their studies further for the learned professions. Under\r\nthe present State law education is compulsory, between the ages of\r\neight and sixteen, and parents, guardians and employers detaining the\r\nchild between those ages are liable to fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nUnder the compulsory education law our town appoints annually for\r\neach of the school districts an officer known as the truant officer,\r\nwhose duty it is to look after the interests of those who will not\r\nlook after their own, and compel all children within the school age\r\nto be in attendance upon the public school during the required\r\nperiod. The State apportionment of school funds for 1907 for the town\r\nwas $4,300.\r\n\r\nThe town has six election or polling places, known as Districts Nos.\r\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. No. 1 includes the voters in the Amity and Pine\r\nIsland district; No. 2, those in Florida and vicinity; Nos. 3, 4 and\r\n5, the village of Warwick, Bellvale and New Milford; No. 6. Greenwood\r\nLake and Sterling. The total vote polled for Governor in the town in\r\n1900 was 1,218.\r\n\r\nThe principal farm products are dairying, onions, peaches, apples,\r\nhay and potatoes. Milk is condensed at several places in the town.\r\nThe mineral products are iron, granite, mica, white and blue\r\nlimestone. The white limestone is very valuable for fluxing purposes\r\nand in the manufacture of Portland cement. Large deposits of the same\r\nare found in the western part of the town, running from near Florida\r\nto the Vernon Valley. The blue limestone is valuable for building\r\npurposes and is found very generally in different parts of the town.\r\nClay beds also exist at Florida and at Durland's, from which brick\r\nhave been manufactured.\r\n\r\nThe present bonded debt of the town (1907) is $4,950, bearing 4 per\r\ncent. interest, which is very small considering the amounts expended\r\nin the construction of the new iron bridges in the town during the\r\nlast thirty years--nearly twenty--and the cost of new road\r\nconstruction and for damages to the town roads and bridges caused by\r\nthe great flood of 1903, when one bridge was completely destroyed,\r\nand nine were damaged, besides the damages to many of the public\r\nroads, and other small bridges.\r\n\r\nVILLAGES AND HAMLETS.\r\n\r\n                        _Warwick_\r\n\r\nThe village of Warwick was known as early as 1719, but was not\r\nsettled until about 1764. It is the largest village in the town and\r\nthe only one incorporated. Its area is 395 acres, and its population\r\n(1905) was 1,767. It was incorporated under a special act of the\r\nLegislature in 1867, and re-incorporated under the general village\r\nlaw in 1901. Built on rolling land in the valley west of the Warwick\r\nMountains, it is an ideal spot for country homes. The land is well\r\ndrained, the Wawayanda Creek flowing through the center of the town\r\nin a southeasterly direction. The mean elevation of the valley is\r\n550 feet, and the nearby mountains rise to a height of 1,200 to 1,400\r\nfeet. The varied pastoral scenes of wood, stream and meadow, with\r\nhere and there a lake, and the tall peaks of the Catskills in the\r\ndistance greeting the eye from these heights, are said by travelers\r\nto equal, if not surpass, anything else of the kind in all the wide\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFine roads, affording delightful drives, extend from Warwick, in\r\nevery direction, some among the neatly kept farms in the valley and\r\nothers through winding ways among the hills. With such an unrivaled\r\nenvironment, Warwick has grown famous for its own peculiar beauties.\r\nOne cannot say that our village is quaint or old-fashioned, with\r\nswinging gates, grassy lanes, and moss-covered roofs; rather, it has\r\nan air of smartness, blended with polished repose. It is a pretty\r\npark with velvety lawns, showing to vast advantage groups of\r\nflowering shrubs, unmarred by fences, and with the houses well apart,\r\ngiving an air of freedom from cramped conditions.\r\n\r\nNot only the fine mansions that have been built by prosperous country\r\nmerchants, professional men and city folk, but also the modest homes\r\nof the village mechanics and artisans, all show the same individual\r\npublic spirit, not to be outdone in keeping things spruced up and\r\nfreshly painted. Here and there are old homesteads where son has\r\nsucceeded father for generations, yet the old homes look well and\r\nbecoming in their new and airy clothes. The advent of broad avenues\r\nand flag walks have forever effaced the winding trails, and with them\r\nmuch of the sweet Indian legendary has been obliterated. For all\r\nthese rolling hills were once covered with chestnut, birch, maple and\r\npine trees. There is something pathetic in the passing of the red man,\r\nthe type of years gone by, as the impress of civilization\r\nunrelentingly, step by step, has crowded upon his tepee and forced\r\nhim westward.\r\n\r\nYet the maples, as planted by our fathers, forming bowers over\r\nstreets, are more beautiful than the pine tree. We have no \"Unter den\r\nLinden,\" but we might claim an \"Unter den Maples.\"\r\n\r\nWarwick has been called the Queen Village, also a Village of Homes.\r\nIf she is not truly the former, she is easily and far away a village\r\nof homes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Moore Sanford.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1830 Henry William Herbert, an English gentleman and\r\nwriter, better known as Frank Forester, visited the village and\r\nstopped at the old inn, known as Tom Ward's, now and then called the\r\nWawayanda House. Forester has celebrated us in his famous book of\r\nsporting tales and adventures called \"Warwick Woodlands,\" in which\r\nhe tells many a quaint tale of the doings of himself and mine host\r\nWard, (whom he cleverly calls Draw by simply inverting the letters of\r\nthe name), and of many other sportsmen of that early day.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever paid our vale and village a higher tribute than\r\nForester, when he said:\r\n\r\n\"In all the river counties of New York there is none to my mind which\r\npresents such a combination of all natural beauties, pastoral, rural,\r\nsylvan and at times almost sublime, as old Orange, nor any part of it\r\nto me so picturesque, or so much endeared by early recollections, as\r\nthe fair vale of Warwick. . . . Throughout its length and breadth, it\r\nis one of the most fertile and beautiful, and the most Arcadian\r\nregions of the United States; poverty in its lower and more squalid\r\naspects, if not in any real or tangible shape, is unknown within its\r\nprecincts; its farmers, the genuine old solid yeoman of the land, the\r\nbackbone and bulwark of the country, rich as their teeming pastures,\r\nhospitable as their warm hearts and ever open doors, stanch and firm\r\nas the everlasting hills among which in truly pleasant places their\r\nlines have fallen, would be the pride of any nation, kingdom or\r\nrepublic; its women are among the fairest daughters of a country\r\nwhere beauty is the rule rather than the exception. . . . Sweet vale\r\nof Warwick, sweet Warwick, loveliest village of the vale, it may be\r\nI shall never see you more, for the silver cord is loosened, the\r\ngolden bowl is broken, which most attached me to your quiet and\r\nsequestered shades. . . . May blessings be about you, beautiful\r\nWarwick; may your fields be as green, your waters as bright, the\r\ncattle upon your hundred hills as fruitful, as in the days of old.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the village voted the sum of $600 to lay the sidewalks over\r\nthe Main street bridge. In 1886 the sum of $4,200 was voted by the\r\ntax-payers to buy the lot and build the brick building occupied by\r\nExcelsior Hose Company. In 1889 an application was made to the\r\ntrustees for the organization of the Goodwill Hook and Ladder\r\nCompany. In 1891 a truck was bought for said ladder company at a cost\r\nof $600. The system for working the village streets was changed in\r\nthis year to the money system. In 1895 a number of the citizens\r\ncontributed the sum of $433.03 for the purchase of a sprinkling cart,\r\na proposition previously submitted to the taxpayers for the purchase\r\nof the same having been defeated at a special election. In 1896,\r\nRaymond Hose Company No. 2, to look after the interests of the\r\nvillage in the west end, was organized by consent of the trustees.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, the sum of $500 was voted for the purpose of a fire alarm.\r\nIn this year the first and only franchise ever granted by the village\r\nwas given to Sharp & Chapman for a term of fifty years, for an\r\nelectric light plant.\r\n\r\nThese parties having failed to carry out their agreement, the village\r\nthe next year granted a franchise for the same purpose to the Warwick\r\nValley Light and Power Company, of the same duration.\r\n\r\nSince 1898 the village has been lighted with electric light at a cost\r\nof about $2,000 per year, the present plant consisting of\r\nninety-seven incandescent electric lights and six 2,000 candle power\r\narc lamps.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the taxpayers voted the sum of $1,600 for the purchase of a\r\nlot and the building of a hose house for the Raymond Hose Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 a proposition to reincorporate the village under the general\r\nvillage law was carried. A special election held the same year to\r\nvote upon the proposition of paving our streets with Telford pavement\r\nand asking for the sum of $10,000 for that purpose, was defeated by\r\nonly three votes.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the heirs of the late George W. Sanford donated the sum of\r\n$1,250 to the village for the purpose of a drinking fountain, which\r\nhas been erected and is placed at Fountain Square, corner of Main and\r\nEast Main streets.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1906, Warwick, England, celebrated the two thousand years of\r\nher past history in a great historical pageant upon the grounds of\r\nWarwick Castle. Invitations were issued to all the Warwicks of the\r\nworld--fourteen in all--to be present and participate in these\r\nfestivities. Our board appointed its president, Ferdinand V. Sanford,\r\nas its representative, who attended the celebration, and delivered in\r\nperson the following resolutions of greeting and congratulation:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Henry A. Benedict.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonorable Thomas Kemp,\r\n\r\n    Mayor of the Corporation of Warwick, England\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nAccept congratulations and greetings from your daughter and namesake\r\nacross the sea, on the occasion of your great historical pageant,\r\nwherein somewhat of your ancient and honorable past is reproduced,\r\nnot merely in centuries, but in millenniums of time.\r\n\r\nAs Americans we are proud of our English ancestry, and of that mighty\r\nnation, on whose empire the sun never sets, whose history is the\r\nhistory of everything that makes for progress, a higher civilization\r\nand the enlightenment and uplifting of mankind.\r\n\r\nMay God continue to bless England and America, the leading Christian\r\nnations of the earth, whose history teaches the world of the\r\ntranscendent value of the life, liberty and happiness of man.\r\n\r\nDone at Warwick, New York, United States of America, on the\r\ntwenty-sixth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and\r\nsix.\r\n\r\n     The Village of Warwick.\r\n\r\n             By\r\n\r\n (Seal.)     Ferdinand V. Sanford, President,\r\n             Charles Wutke,\r\n             George H. Strong,\r\n                                   Trustees\r\n  F. C. Cary,\r\n    Clerk of the Corporation.\r\n\r\nTo which the mayor replied officially as follows:\r\n\r\nBorough of Warwick, to-wit:\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the mayor, aldermen and councilors of the said\r\nborough in Council assembled, on the 13th day of July, 1906,\r\n\r\nIt was resolved: That the congratulatory address from the corporation\r\nof the village of Warwick, in the State of New York, United States of\r\nAmerica, presented to the mayor on the occasion of the recent\r\nHistorical Pageant, be entered on the minutes of the Council, and\r\nthat a cordial vote of thanks for their sympathetic greetings be\r\naccorded to the sister municipality with an earnest hope for its\r\ncontinued prosperity.\r\n\r\nAnd that a copy of the resolution be sealed and transmitted to the\r\npresident of the corporation.\r\n\r\n                 Thomas Kemp,\r\n                         Mayor,\r\n\r\n                 Brabazon Campbell,\r\n                         Town Clerk.           (Seal.)\r\n\r\nDuring the present year (1907) the village has been the recipient of\r\na fine town clock, presented by Mr. Pierson E. Sanford. The clock is\r\nstationed in the tower of the Methodist church on Main street.\r\n\r\nAt a special election held this year the sum of $4,200 was voted to\r\npurchase the building and lots formerly owned by John A. Dator and\r\nothers, on Main street and Wheeler avenue. It is the purpose of the\r\ntrustees to change the building, and adapt it for village purposes,\r\nsuch as a village hall, office for records, maps and files, and the\r\nrooms of Goodwill Hook and Ladder Company.\r\n\r\n                       _New Milford._\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of New Milford lies southwest of Warwick, and forms a part\r\nof the boundary line between New York and New Jersey. It was formerly\r\ncalled Jockey Hollow. It comprises an area of a little more than\r\n2,000 acres of the most fertile and well watered land in Warwick\r\nValley. When the Wawayanda patent was deeded by the Indians to twelve\r\nwhite men in 1702, the twelfth part deed to Cornelius Christiance\r\nincluded what is now known as New Milford. Cornelius Christiance sold\r\nhis share to Derrick Vanderburgh in 1704, and the latter sold to\r\nEverett & Glows, land speculators, in 1714, for a little more than\r\n$500. In 1724, the land was purchased by Thomas DeKay and Benjamin\r\nAske. Settlers now began to come and they were quick to take\r\nadvantage of the superior water facilities. The land was intersected\r\nby Wawayanda Creek, and flowing into this stream were four rushing\r\nmountain streams, all capable of furnishing fine water power, the\r\nlargest of which was the Doublekill, so named because it is the\r\noutlet of Double Pond, or Wawayanda Lake. But not until about the\r\nyear 1770 were any mills operated, excepting a saw mill and the\r\nforge on Wawayanda Creek on the farm recently owned by the Edward L.\r\nDavis heirs. During the year 1780, we find among the settlers the\r\nDeKays, the Davises, the Demarests, the Lazears, and Wood. The first\r\nexcise money was paid into the treasury from the New Milford tavern\r\nin 1790 by Cornelius Lazear. A grist mill was built that year on the\r\nwest side of the Doublekill, on the farm known as the Kiernan farm,\r\nand much further up the stream than the present mill. This mill was\r\noperated many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 John Lazear built a grist mill on the site of the present\r\nmill. In connection with the mill he had a factory for manufacturing\r\naxe and shovel handles. Between the years 1805 and 1825 New Milford\r\nwas an exceedingly busy place. The original and only town at the time\r\nwas where the post-office is at present.\r\n\r\nThere were six mills on the Doublekill, and four on the stream\r\ncovered by the arch bridge, near the post-office, known as Green Mine\r\nBrook. On the Doublekill there were the grist mill, or axe handle\r\nfactory, and tannery owned by S. W. Clason, now owned by E. M.\r\nBahrmann; further down the stream a feed mill, a saw mill and a\r\nfulling or wool-carding mill. Then on the Green Mine stream there\r\nwere a clover seed mill, plaster mill, cider mill with distillery,\r\nand about where William T. Vandervort's barn is located there was a\r\nlarge saw mill run by David Demarest. A very good schoolhouse was\r\nsituated just west of the present Methodist church. A post-office was\r\nestablished in 1815--the first postmaster was Merritt Coleman. The\r\nturnpike running between New York and Port Jervis left the main road\r\nnear the present home of Darius Fancher, crossed the E. L. Davis\r\nfarm, continued northward over a bridge which was east of the present\r\nsite of Borden's creamery, and up the hill to the road which now\r\npasses west of the house known as Peachblow. This was the main road\r\nto the northwest. Mr. E. L. Davis built a fulling and carding mill\r\nnear the bridge and operated that as well as a saw mill.\r\n\r\nFurther down on Wawayanda Creek there were a saw mill, cider mill and\r\ndistillery owned by John Ryerson. The \"covered bridge\" was built\r\nabout 1830. In 1835, a boarding school for young ladies was opened in\r\nthe house now occupied by John Lines. The principal, Charles G.\r\nWinfield, was a man of profound learning. Here the best people of\r\nWarwick and vicinity sent their daughters to be educated. It was a\r\nclassical school of the highest order. The Methodist church was\r\nopened in 1838. In 1861, When there was a call for volunteers. New\r\nMilford, with a population of only 150 persons, responded with\r\ntwenty-eight men.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of the dairy business in Orange County, less\r\nattention was paid to milling interests. In 1866, a factory for\r\ncondensing milk was built where the Kiernan fulling and carding mill\r\nstood. This was abandoned after the railroad was built in 1879. In\r\n1898 a fire swept away the business portion of New Milford, and it\r\nhas not been entirely rebuilt.\r\n\r\nAt present the town is regaining some of the business prosperity it\r\nenjoyed one hundred years ago. There are two grist mills and a saw\r\nmill, and one of the largest creameries for bottling and condensing\r\nmilk in the county, owned by Borden's Milk Company, where 4,500\r\ngallons of milk are received and shipped daily. There are several\r\nold cemeteries scattered throughout New Milford, where one may read\r\nthe names of those who lived when the \"years were young.\"\r\n\r\n                          _Pine Island._\r\n\r\nPine Island is a village lying two miles northwest of Amity at the\r\nterminus of the Goshen and Deckertown railroad, leased by the Erie.\r\nIt has a public school, a hotel, a store and post-office.\r\n\r\n                     _Greenwood Lake and Sterling._\r\n\r\nThe Chesekook's patent, confirmed by letters patent of Queen Anne,\r\nwhich embraced this district, was granted March 25, 1707, by\r\nManngomack and other Indians, whose names are unpronounceable, and\r\nwho signed by their marks, representatives of the sub-tribes of the\r\nMinsis, whose totem was the wolf, a branch of the Lenni-Lenapes,\r\nwhose totem was the turkey, a branch of the great Algonkin or\r\nAlgonquin tribe, or nation, which held sway over them.\r\n\r\nThis deed was dated December 30, 1702, and recorded in the Orange\r\nCounty clerk's office, June 1, 1736. The original patent, bearing\r\nQueen Anne's seal, is in the possession of the Sterling Iron and\r\nRailway Company. Sterling and Greenwood Lake are now embraced in the\r\nsixth election district of the town of Warwick.\r\n\r\nCharles Clinton surveyed this patent for the owners in common,\r\nbeginning April 1, 1735, and ending December 13, 1749. He mentions in\r\nhis field book, as early as 1745, that iron works were in operation\r\nat Sterling, but to what extent is not stated. The old furnace at\r\nSterling, now in ruins, is said to have been built in 1751, and from\r\nit was drawn the iron from which the great chain was made to cross\r\nthe Hudson River in Revolutionary days from West Point to\r\nConstitution Island. This chain was built by Abel Noble & Co., Peter\r\nTownsend signing the contract for said firm for its construction\r\nFebruary 2, 1778, to be finished by April 1, 1778. This chain was\r\ndrawn across the river April 30, 1778. A bronze tablet commemorating\r\nthe building of Sterling furnace was unveiled at the foot of the\r\nfurnace on June 23, 1906. Iron mining is still in active operation,\r\na shaft extending diagonally under Sterling Lake a distance of over\r\n2,000 feet, but the ore is all shipped to other furnaces. The iron\r\nindustry created a need for charcoal, and from Revolutionary times\r\nuntil about 1865 cutting wood and burning charcoal was an industry\r\nextending all over this section, and through the mountains of\r\nGreenwood Lake and Sterling is a network of wood roads and many\r\nfoundations where formerly stood the dwellings of collieries.\r\nSterling Mountain rises about 600 feet above the surface of Greenwood\r\nLake, which is about nine miles long and 700 feet elevation above sea\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frank A. Campbell]\r\n\r\nThe map of this section made by Robert Erskine for General Washington\r\ngives it the name of Long pond. About midway on the west side and\r\nabout 300 feet from the shore of Greenwood Lake stands an old furnace\r\non the furnace brook, which was built about seventy-five years ago\r\nby William Noble of Bellvale. The furnace was a failure from the\r\nstart, as the stream of water furnished insufficient power for the\r\nblast. About 1845 Wanaque Creek, at the outlet of Greenwood Lake, was\r\ncrossed by a dam, which raised the lake about eight feet, resulting\r\nin the overflow of about a mile of low land at both the north and\r\nsouth ends of the lake, forming a reservoir for the use of the Morris\r\nand Essex Canal, nine miles long and a mile wide. The New York and\r\nGreenwood Lake railroad reached here in 1876. The terminal station at\r\nthe line between New York and New Jersey on the east shore, called\r\nthen \"State Line\" (now Sterling Forest), was accessible by boats\r\nonly, there being no public road until 1889, when one was built by\r\nthe town of Warwick, the contract being taken by Conrad Diehl of\r\nGoshen. The steamboat _Montclair,_ capable of carrying 400 passengers\r\nor more, was built and launched in 1876, to accommodate travelers\r\nfrom the railroad. Smaller boats had been previously built, first the\r\n_Pioneer,_ a sail boat, then the _Sylph,_ then the _Montclair,_ and\r\nlater the _Anita,_ and at present several small steamers and\r\nnaphtha launches without number are in use.\r\n\r\nPrior to the completion of the railroad visitors reached here by\r\nstage from Monks on the south or from Monroe on the north. Religious\r\nservices were held in a log schoolhouse one mile north of Greenwood\r\nLake prior to 1850, when under the pastorate of Rev. J. H.\r\nHaunhurst, the first Methodist church of Greenwood Lake was built,\r\nwhere services were regularly held until 1898, when the settlement\r\nconcentrating about two miles farther south, it was deemed expedient\r\nto build a new Methodist Episcopal church on land donated for the\r\npurpose by M. V. Wilson, opposite the new schoolhouse, which for the\r\nsame reason was built about two and one-quarter miles south of its\r\nformer site, and now has an attendance of sixty-three pupils. The\r\nschool at Sterling mines has about the same number of pupils,\r\nchildren of the miners, religious services being held in the\r\nschoolhouse under Methodist supervision.\r\n\r\nThe new Methodist Episcopal church of Greenwood Lake was built under\r\nthe supervision of Pastor Cranston, and now in 1907 Rev. J. H.\r\nCalyer is pastor. For fifty-seven years the church has never been\r\nwithout a pastor in charge of regular services.\r\n\r\nIn about the year 1880 a summer school of Christian philosophy, under\r\nthe supervision of William O. McDowell, was begun in a fine\r\nauditorium erected for the purpose at Warwick Woodlands on the west\r\nshore of the lake, and, for the accommodation of visitors, an\r\nencampment hotel in connection with the Greenwood Lake Association\r\nclubhouse was under the supervision of Lyndon Y. Jenness. Dr. Charles\r\nH. Deems, Dr. Lyman Abbott and many other speakers on religious,\r\nsocial and philosophical themes, spoke to the assembled multitudes.\r\nThis club house for a time was Greenwood Lake's center of interest,\r\nbut for lack of support financially it was finally abandoned to the\r\nuses and amusements of excursionists. In 1906 the dilapidated\r\nbuilding was demolished.\r\n\r\nAbout 1880 a movement took form to inaugurate a church on what was\r\nknown as the lime rocks, and under the management of Rev. Mr.\r\nBradford, of Montclair, assisted by local friends, a tent was erected\r\nhere where services from time to time were held. Now a stone church\r\noccupying this most picturesque spot is under construction and the\r\nsupervision of E. G. Lewis, of New York City, representing the\r\nEpiscopal church.\r\n\r\nCivilization's onward march is taking strong form here, and over the\r\nold Indian camping grounds, where numberless arrow heads, spear\r\npoints, stone axes and beautifully ornamented fragments of pottery\r\nbear testimony to the race that has departed, leaving only here and\r\nthere a name that claims relationship, stand to-day spacious hotels,\r\ntowering churches, palatial homes, and the last society formed for\r\ntheir protection is the Pioneer Fire Company of Greenwood Lake, which\r\nwas formed May 3, 1907.\r\n\r\n                        _Little York._\r\n\r\nThe hamlet of Little York is about a mile east from Pine Island, in\r\nthe town of Warwick. The first settler, Conrad Luft, came from Russia\r\nand settled there in 1886. About five years later Henry Lust, another\r\nRussian, came and located. Then followed in 1897 Peter Miller, Conrad\r\nSchmick, and August Youngmann. The next year eight more families came\r\nfrom Russia, buying land and building homes. Their industry is\r\nonion raising, for which the black meadow land which they cultivate\r\nis admirably adapted. They are Russians, but speak the German\r\nlanguage and are Lutherans in religion. They are very industrious and\r\nthrifty, and nearly all have their homes and the land all paid for.\r\nIn 1907 there were twenty-four houses, and one church, the\r\nEvangelical Lutheran, of which Rev. Gerhard Rademacher is the rector.\r\nThere are about 200 in population, 100 communicant members of said\r\nchurch, and thirty-three voters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The William Wisner House, Wisner, Erected, 1770.]\r\n\r\nA parochial school is maintained in connection with the church and\r\nhas thirty-nine children in attendance. The church was built in 1898,\r\nfinished in 1901, and incorporated in 1904. Rev. George Kaestner\r\nserved the church until 1904. It was under his ministry that the\r\nchurch was begun and completed. He was followed by the present\r\npastor, Rev. Gerhard Rademacher, during whose ministry the parsonage\r\nwas built and the cemetery of three acres acquired.\r\n\r\nOther Russians are expected the present year to come and settle here.\r\n\r\n                            _Amity._\r\n\r\nAmity is the western portion of the town of Warwick, extending about\r\nthree miles in radius from the Presbyterian church, the only house of\r\nworship in the village.\r\n\r\nThe church was organized by a committee of the Presbytery of Hudson\r\non September 15, 1809, but the first building had been erected and\r\ndedicated thirteen years previous, August 1, 1796. The building\r\nstands on a lovely eminence 500 feet above sea level and commands a\r\nsplendid view in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe two conical mountains, Adam and Eve, some four miles distant,\r\nstand to the northeast and are about 800 feet above the level of the\r\nsea. These granite mountains are rough and rocky, and are covered\r\nwith impenetrable brush and bramble.\r\n\r\nThe chief occupation of the people is extensive farming. Peach\r\ngrowing, however, became a popular and profitable industry about\r\n1885, and continued for twenty years, during which time all the\r\nprincipal farmers turned their best land into orchards, from which\r\nthey shipped thousands of baskets of delicious fruit to New York\r\nCity and other towns, where there was great demand and high prices.\r\n\r\nIt was not uncommon for a successful orchardist to realize from\r\n$5,000 to $10,000 for his crop in a single season. The land soon\r\nbecame exhausted, however, the San Jose scale attacked and killed the\r\ntrees, and the business declined as rapidly as it had sprung up.\r\nAbout the present date (1907) a new find in the land is receiving\r\nmuch attention--limestone in unlimited quantity in most of the farms.\r\nProspectors are finding zinc and other valuable minerals, which\r\nindicate wealth for those who still possess the soil.\r\n\r\n                            _Bellvale._\r\n\r\nBellvale village, known in Colonial times as Wawayanda, is situated\r\non the lower rapids of Longhouse Creek, which here enters the meadows\r\nand flows a mile and one-half to Stone Bridge station, where it\r\nenters the Wawayanda, which has its source in Clark's Lake, and then\r\nloses its name when merged in the smaller stream. Longhouse Creek has\r\nits source in a swamp in New Jersey a short distance east from\r\nWawayanda Lake. It has a large watershed at an elevation above tide\r\nwater of about 1,100 feet, and in its descent of six or seven miles\r\nruns through several fine storage basins and down numerous rapids and\r\nfalls. For a distance of 500 feet options were taken on some of the\r\nstorage basins by the Ramapo Water Company during its active days,\r\nwith a view to conducting the water into the headquarters of the\r\nRamapo River.\r\n\r\nThis stream is well adapted for the generation of water power for\r\nelectrical or manufacturing purposes, and we learn from colonial\r\nhistory, was utilized by Lawrence Scrauley in 1745 to operate a forge\r\nof tilt-hammer for a plating and slitting mill. This was the only\r\nmill of this kind in the State of New York, and in 1750 was not in\r\noperation. Under the Crown we were not allowed to advance the\r\nmanufacturing stage of iron beyond the pig and bar iron stages. It\r\nseems Scrauley took his chances in this secluded portion of the\r\nvalley to furnish more convenient sizes of iron to meet the wants of\r\nthe blacksmiths and builders of that day, and thus avoid paying\r\ntribute to the manufacturers of the mother country. The ruins of the\r\nhearth where the ore was melted, the raceway, and the pit for the\r\nwheel that operated the tilt-hammer, are still visible, as well as\r\nthe mudsill of the foundation of the dam.\r\n\r\nDuring the War of 1812, a Mr. Peck had an establishment upon the\r\nstream, near the home of William M. Mann, where he manufactured\r\nbridle-bits, stirrups, buckles and saddle trees for our cavalry. As\r\nwell as agricultural implements generally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William C. Eager.]\r\n\r\nThe old forge site and the lands along the rapids up to the line of\r\nthe Chesekook patent were bought by Daniel Burt in 1760, and soon\r\nafter he built a flouring mill and a saw mill, both of which were\r\nwashed away by the breaking away of the dam during a very unusually\r\nheavy shower of rain. The present flouring mill is situated near the\r\nsite of the earlier one. A saw mill was built in 1812, by John\r\nBradner and Brower Robinson, and rebuilt by Thomas Burt, who operated\r\nit and a turning shop for about twenty years. The dam has been washed\r\naway and the mill is in ruins. A wool carding factory was built by\r\nNathaniel Jones about 1810. and subsequently enlarged for the\r\nmanufacture of broadcloths by Joseph Brooks, but is not now in\r\noperation. James, the son of Daniel Burt, about 1812 settled three of\r\nhis sons at Bellvale in the milling and mercantile business. They\r\nestablished shops for a blacksmith, carpenter, wagon-maker, cooper,\r\ntailor, shoemaker and the manufacture of red earthen pottery.\r\nBenjamin Bradner had a tannery before 1812 where the ruins of the old\r\nsaw mill are situated. The vats were located where is now the old\r\nraceway, and the bark was ground in a circular curb upon the flat\r\nrock back of the saw mill rolling a heavy mill-stone over the bark,\r\nas at one time apples were reduced to pumice by cider makers.\r\n\r\nAbout 1808 the Bellvale and Monroe turnpike was built to make a\r\nshorter route to the markets along the Ramapo for the produce of the\r\nfarmers of Warwick. It was nine miles long and shortened the distance\r\npreviously traveled by about one-half.\r\n\r\nThe road was maintained above fifty years and the charter then\r\nsurrendered to the State, and the road divided into districts--a fund\r\non hand of about $500 was spent in putting the road in order before\r\nthe charter was surrendered. The stockholders never received any\r\nmoney for their investment. The massive stone bridge over the channel\r\nat Bellvale was built in 1832, to take the place of the old wooden\r\none then unsafe for travel. Recently the old bridge site, as well as\r\nnearly all the land along the Longhouse Creek for four or five miles,\r\nhas passed into the hands of one owner, also all the mills and about\r\n3,000 acres of land lying along the stream. The probable development\r\nof the water power for electrical purposes and an early completion of\r\nthe State road from Pine Island to Tuxedo promises a brighter future.\r\nTradition accounts for the name of the stream from the long house\r\nthat stood on its bank near the residence of the late C. R. Cline.\r\nThe Indians that settled there built their houses end to end and, as\r\ntheir families became more numerous, a long house was built instead\r\nof the isolated circular wigwams of many tribes. That there was an\r\nIndian settlement at this place is highly probable from the nearby\r\nstreams for fishing, swamp and mountain for hunting, and the fertile\r\nprairie-like land for their crops of corn and tobacco. In the part\r\nwhere the land has been cultivated plenty of flint arrow heads and\r\nlarge chips of flint with sharp edges have been found. The flint\r\nchips were used by the squaws in cultivating corn and tobacco.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, in digging a cellar for an addition to the house, the\r\nskeleton of an Indian of immense size was found, if the writer\r\nmistakes not, in a sitting posture. This may have been only one of a\r\ngreat many buried there and might have been their chief.\r\n\r\nOut of a population of only about 330, at the time of the Civil War,\r\nforty-two were enrolled from Bellvale and the immediate vicinity. In\r\n1907 the population of the place is estimated at about 300.\r\n\r\n                            _Edenville._\r\n\r\nEdenville, known in the early annals of local history as Postville,\r\nin honor of Colonel Jacobus Post, one of its pioneer settlers, enjoys\r\na picturesque location three miles west of Warwick, with which place\r\nit is closely connected in its postal facilities and commercial\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nDoubtless its early progenitors, because of the establishment of this\r\nlittle hamlet within a radius of great agricultural fertility,\r\npredicted its growth to be vastly greater than its actual development\r\nproved, but as one by one the railroads on either side were\r\nestablished Edenville was left to its primitive means of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nNearly north of the village of about one hundred inhabitants are\r\nlocated the isolated peaks of Mts. Adam and Eve, interest in the\r\nmineral deposits of which has increased with time. In the decades\r\npast, specimens of granite, syenite, granular quartz, hornblende,\r\narsenical iron, and white limestone were gathered by the seeker of\r\nmineralogical specimens. Later the quarrying of granite was\r\nundertaken by the Orange County Granite Company and the Empire State\r\nGranite Company. The quality of the granite found within the mountain\r\nconfines is of a high order, but the difficulty of transportation\r\nforbids an extensive output.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. E. Sanford]\r\n\r\nThe oldest home of Postville, known as the \"Shingle House,\" was built\r\nin 1734, and remained an object of much interest to visitors of the\r\nvillage until destroyed by fire in the winter of 1907.\r\n\r\nThis was the home of Col. Jacobus Post and is said to have been a\r\nhaven for travelers on their early tours across the Netherland\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Edenville Methodist Church was organized on September 11th, 1822.\r\n\r\nThe school district known as Purling Brook district was organized in\r\n1813.\r\n\r\n                      _Florida._\r\n\r\nProbably no village of our county presents so great a contrast in its\r\nlocal interests of to-day as compared with the early incentives of\r\nits development, as does Florida, or Floridus, land of the red\r\nflowers, situated six miles south of Goshen, six miles north of\r\nWarwick, which points are connected by a recently constructed State\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nIn records relating to the early settlement of the village in the\r\nlatter part of the eighteenth century we find the names of Seward,\r\nArmstrong, Wisner, Carr, Poppino, Randall, Thompson and Roe as\r\nactively identified with its early interests.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the heart of a prolific agricultural section, recently\r\ndeveloped to its full extent, political and scholastic ambition\r\nactuated the impulses of many of its earlier settlers, still to the\r\nsteadfast, sterling qualities of those engaged in agricultural\r\npursuits must be attributed its constant development.\r\n\r\nDuring the governorship of George Clinton, 1777-1795, Florida was\r\nrepresented in the Legislature, and was prominent in the\r\nRevolutionary struggle. Later, in the political arena, we recall the\r\ncareer of William H. Seward, elected as state senator in 1831,\r\nGovernor in 1838, United States Senator in 1849, and appointed\r\nSecretary of State in 1861.\r\n\r\nFlorida to-day shows marked changes in its church history. The\r\nMethodist Church was established in 1868. As early as 1742 a\r\nPresbyterian Church was organized. In 1837 the church edifice was\r\nconsumed by fire. The present structure was erected in June, 1838. In\r\n1839 a second Presbyterian Church was founded, but in 1878, the two\r\nchurches were united. Two flourishing church organizations of the\r\nCatholic faith exist, St. Edwards and the St. Joseph's Polish\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\nEducational matters early claimed the attention of the settlers of\r\nFlorida, Samuel S. Seward, De Witt C. Jayne, Robert Armstrong and\r\nJonas Seely serving respectively as school commissioners from 1813 to\r\n1843. Judge Samuel S. Seward founded the S. S. Seward Institute in\r\n1848 as a classical school, endowing it with the sum of $20,000. This\r\nschool was held in the old Randolph hotel. After Judge Seward's\r\ndeath, a young ladies' seminary was established, opposite the\r\noriginal school building, and for years Florida was noted for its\r\nsuperior boarding school.\r\n\r\nWith the improved common school advantages of later years came the\r\ndesire of the citizens to widen the influence of the school as\r\noriginally designed, and accordingly a new edifice was erected\r\nbearing the name of S. S. Seward Institute, receiving the benefit of\r\nthe reserve fund, and also the State appropriation for high schools,\r\nthus fulfilling in a greater sense the beneficent plans of the\r\noriginal founder.\r\n\r\nA prominent factor in agricultural development has been the influx of\r\nmany Poles and Germans of thrifty type, whose business, at first\r\nconfined to onion and celery growth, is gradually reaching out to\r\nother industries and professions. Under their management largely the\r\nvalue of the black dirt land during the past thirty years has\r\nincreased from $10 to $200 per acre.\r\n\r\nWithin the last year brick making has been revived. In July, 1905,\r\nthe Florida Civic Improvement Club was organized.\r\n\r\nA sketch of Florida would hardly be complete, without mention of\r\nGlenmere, a beautiful sheet of water, furnishing the village water\r\nsupply, located one mile east of the village.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of its early christening as Thompson's Pond, its clear\r\nwaters have furnished pleasure to the boatman and fisherman.\r\n\r\n                            CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n_The Reformed Church of Warwick_ was organized by a committee of the\r\nClassis of Paramus in 1804, and was duly incorporated on March 18,\r\n1807, under the corporate name and title of \"The Consistory of the\r\nReformed Protestant Dutch Church and Congregation of Warwick.\" It was\r\nthe successor of the Presbyterian Church and occupies the same site\r\nof the earlier society. In 1904 it celebrated its centennial.\r\n\r\nDuring Mr. Crispell's ministry the present stone church was built and\r\nfurnished at a cost of about $40,000. The new edifice was begun in\r\n1889, and dedicated June 26, 1890.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stott Mills.]\r\n\r\n_Union African Methodist Episcopal Church._--This organization was\r\nbegun in the winter of 1906. The church was incorporated under the\r\nabove name on March 12, 1906. Rev. Joseph Stiles was the first\r\npastor. During the year that Rev. Stiles had charge a new church was\r\nbuilt on McEwan street at a cost of something like $2,000.\r\n\r\n_The Roman Catholic Church of St. Stephen._--In Shea's history we\r\nread, Father Steinmeyer, S. J., better known as Father Farmer,\r\ncrossed over from his New Jersey missions into Orange County and\r\nbaptized seven near Warwick. After his death, other priests may have\r\nvisited the neighborhood, but there is no record of the fact.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Father Ward was appointed resident pastor at Goshen, with,\r\ncharge of all Orange County, except the strip along the Hudson. The\r\nbuilding formerly occupied by the Methodist church in Church street\r\nwas purchased by the denomination, but was not taken possession of\r\nuntil 1867.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1887, the Presbyterian church at Florida was purchased.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1887, the cemetery ground was purchased at Warwick for $350,\r\nabout an acre and a half.\r\n\r\nFather Minogue erected the present church on South street in the year\r\n1903, at a cost of $16,000.\r\n\r\n_The Calvary Baptist Church of Warwick._--This church was formed on\r\nthe 4th of January, 1866. Very soon after its organization, measures\r\nwere taken to erect a house of worship. A lot was purchased on West\r\nstreet, in the village of Warwick, in 1867, and the edifice was\r\ndedicated August 26, 1868. The parsonage was built the following\r\nyear--1869. Total expenditure about $20,000. In 1902 the house of\r\nworship was remodeled and a large addition made to the eastern side\r\nfor the use of the Sunday school. Total expenditure, including new\r\nseats and pipe organ, about $10,000. Society incorporated February,\r\n1872.\r\n\r\n_The Methodist Episcopal Church of Warwick._--The list of pastors\r\nsince 1880 is as follows: William Colden, 1880-1882; Cyrus W.\r\nMcPherson, 1883-1884; E. S. Bishop, 1885-1887; Philip M. Waters,\r\n1888-1889; Arthur Thompson, 1800-1894; Frank Heale, 1895-1896; Edwin\r\nH. Carr, 1897-1899; Elmer E. Count, 1900-1902; David McCartney,\r\n1903-1904; J. C. Codington, 1905-1906; E. Stirling Potter, 1907.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, $5,500 was expended on improving church and parsonage. In\r\n1906, $7,250 additional was expended, increasing the value of the\r\nproperty to nearly $13,000. The present membership is 240, an\r\nincrease of 102.\r\n\r\n_The Old School Baptist Church in Warwick._--The principal historical\r\nevents since 1880, when a history of the church was published in\r\nRuttenber's history of the county, are as follows: Elder James\r\nBenedict resigned his charge on June 29, 1786, instead of 1777, as\r\nstated in the published history. A centennial celebration of the\r\norganization of the church was held on October 5, 1865. Elder\r\nLebbeus Lathrop preached the first sermon in the meeting house still\r\nstanding on May 19, 1811. The burying ground belonging to the church\r\nand still in use was started in 1795, and lies nearly opposite the\r\nformer burying ground, on the road from Warwick to Bellvale.\r\n\r\n_Christ Church (Episcopal)._--The first attempt to start an Episcopal\r\nchurch in Warwick was in 1804, but the plan was not consummated. In\r\n1854 another effort was made, and services were held in the former\r\nMethodist Episcopal church until 1859, under the Rev. W. H. Carter,\r\nwhen again the project was abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the Rev. George Zabriskie Gray, then in deacon's orders, held\r\nservices in Warwick for about six months, when he was called to\r\nanother charge.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Rev. N. F. Ludlum was called, and a certificate of\r\nincorporation of the parish was executed under the name of Christ\r\nChurch, Warwick, N. Y. In 1865 a building committee was appointed,\r\ncomposed of Grinnell Burt, John Cowdrey and J. Mason McJimsey. The\r\nbuilding was opened for divine worship the ensuing year, 1866.\r\n\r\n_The Y. M. C. A. of Warwick._--This organization was begun in 1879,\r\nincorporated in 1885, and in 1907 owns a building and lot on Main\r\nstreet, with a new gymnasium, costing about $6,000, entirely free of\r\ndebt. It also owns a library of over 1,200 volumes, part donated and\r\npart purchased by the association. The library is registered at\r\nAlbany, and is the only free public library in the village.\r\n\r\n                          BURIAL PLACES.\r\n\r\nFor over a century the tract of land lying to the north of the\r\nReformed church was used as a burying ground. The deeds of conveyance\r\nto the then trustees of the Presbyterian church, the predecessor of\r\nthe Reformed church--Francis Baird, John Simson and George Nance,\r\ndated January 11, and April 23, 1793--recite that in still earlier\r\nconveyances from William Wickham and John Morin Scott, one of which\r\nwas dated March 14, 1770, to William Wisner, of forty-five acres of\r\nland, \"one acre thereof was excepted and reserved there-out for a\r\nburial ground for the use and benefit of the Presbyterian Church of\r\nWarwick.\" In 1889, at the time when the new stone church was built,\r\nthere had been no interments here for perhaps twenty years, and\r\naccordingly a consent was obtained from at least three-fourths of the\r\ncongregations of the Presbyterian and Reformed Dutch Churches for the\r\nremoval of all the remains interred therein, as required by law. The\r\nReformed Church purchased a lot in the Warwick Cemetery and received\r\ndeed from the latter, dated June 15, 1889, to which lot the remains\r\nof all those interred in the church burying ground were removed, and\r\nalso the headstones marking the graves. There are 116 of these\r\nstones; doubtless there were many buried there without any stones to\r\nmark them, and there were other burials there which were afterwards\r\nremoved to family lots in the Warwick Cemetery when the latter was\r\ndedicated in 1867. The oldest stone is one erected to the memory of\r\nAnna, the wife of William Eagles, who departed this life July 8,\r\n1771. There are interred there Revolutionary soldiers, members of\r\nconsistory and many prominent citizens. To William Culver, a donor to\r\nthe church, was erected by the church a monument, bearing this\r\ninscription: \"Sacred to the memory of William Culver, who departed\r\nthis life, at South Hampton, Long Island, October 27, 1822, aged 37\r\nyears, in hope of a blessed immortality.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William B. Sayer]\r\n\r\nThe last interment of which there is a gravestone is that of Daniel\r\nSinsabaugh, who died November 19, 1869, aged thirty-eight years. It\r\nis believed that there were later interments than this, but if so\r\nthere are no stones marking the graves.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Jacob Gaul, a colored man, the sexton of the church\r\nfor over twenty years, was one of the last burials in the old church\r\ngraveyard.\r\n\r\nThe Old School Baptist burying ground, situated at the corner of\r\nGalloway road and Lake street, was first used for burial purposes in\r\nabout 1774, when the meeting house was built there.\r\n\r\nThis plot of land was given to the Baptist Church by Elder James\r\nBenedict, by deed dated September 12, 1791. The trustees of the said\r\nchurch at that time were James Burt, John Morris Foght and John\r\nSutton; consideration mentioned in deed, forty shillings current\r\nmoney; contains seventy-nine perches of land.\r\n\r\nElder James Benedict died September 9, 1792, aged seventy-two years,\r\nsix months, eighteen days, and was buried in this plot of ground, but\r\nno stone marks the spot. This plot was used as a burial ground until\r\n1795.\r\n\r\n                              SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe Warwick Institute continued as an academy until October 1, 1868,\r\nwhen the entire property was transferred to the board of education of\r\nUnion Free School District No. 12. The district at that time\r\nconsisted of the school districts Nos. 11 and 12. Since 1880 two\r\nother districts have been annexed, Nos. 10 and 23.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the board of education built a new brick school house, in the\r\nplace of the old wooden structure and upon the same site, at a total\r\ncost of $23,000. Again in 1901, another brick building was built, at\r\na cost of about $16,000, to take care of the increased demands for\r\nmore school facilities. The latter building was erected upon a new\r\nsite and is called the High School.\r\n\r\nAccording to the last census (1906) there are 512 children of school\r\nage in the district; the actual number enrolled is 450.\r\n\r\n                   MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n_Lehigh & Hudson River Railway Company._--This company was first\r\norganized under the name of the Warwick Valley Railroad Company,\r\nApril 20, 1859, for the purpose of building a road from the village\r\nof Warwick to the line of the New York & Erie Railroad, at or near\r\nthe village of Chester.\r\n\r\nMay, 1879, steps were taken to extend this road to McAfee, Sussex\r\nCounty, and in December, 1880, the Lehigh & Hudson River Railway\r\nCompany was formed for the purpose of extending it to Belvedere,\r\nN. J., on the Delaware River, and connecting with the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad at that point. The line was built and the road opened for\r\nbusiness through to Belvedere in August, 1882.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 an extension was built from a point near Greycourt, N. Y., to\r\nMaybrook, N. Y., connecting at that place with the Poughkeepsie\r\nBridge Road. Arrangements were made to use the tracks of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad to Phillipsburgh, N. J. A bridge was built\r\nacross the Delaware River at that point to Easton, making a\r\ncontinuous line from Easton. Pa., to Maybrook, N. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George W. Sanford]\r\n\r\n_The First National Bank of Warwick._--This bank was organized at a\r\nmeeting of citizens held in January, 1864, at the Warwick Valley\r\nHouse. After a canvass for subscriptions to its stock, which was to\r\nbe $75,000, on January 21, 1864, its articles of association were\r\nadopted. On January 28, the first board of directors was chosen. On\r\nJanuary 29, John L. Welling was chosen president, and on February 6,\r\nJohn Cowdrey was chosen vice-president. On March 11 it was voted to\r\nincrease its capital stock by $25,000, making it $100,000 as it\r\nstands to-day. At the same date Grinnell Burt was sent to Washington\r\nto have this bank made a depository for the internal revenue of this\r\nCongressional District. The bank commenced business April 1, 1864.\r\n\r\n_The Warwick Savings Bank_ was the first one incorporated under the\r\ngeneral law of 1875. It commenced business January 3, 1876. James H.\r\nHolly has been president since January 7, 1879. Thomas Burt has\r\nserved as secretary and treasurer from the organization to the\r\npresent time, and has had the general care and management. There has\r\nbeen a steady increase in deposits year by year, and there is now\r\n(July 1, 1907) on deposit $1,264,636.24 belonging to 3,483\r\ndepositors, and a surplus of $40,683.97.\r\n\r\n_The Warwick Cemetery Association_ was incorporated in 1865. The land\r\npurchased, graded, surveyed and plotted in 1866, was dedicated July\r\n2, 1867, Leonard Cox delivering an appropriate poetical address, and\r\nRev. Cyrus G. Van Derveer the oration on that occasion. The\r\ntwenty-seven acres of ground have a pleasing elevated contour, which\r\nwere plotted by Mr. B. F. Hatheway, of Stamford, Conn.\r\n\r\nThe lands cost about $7,000 and improvements about $5,000. The funds\r\nwere provided by citizens' notes of $100 and $200, which were\r\ncanceled by deeds for lots to the makers of notes. The purchase of a\r\ncottage, building a vault and entrance gates and bringing in the\r\npublic water for fountains were accomplished in the few following\r\nyears and the Association was free from debt, and in 1881 had $2,000\r\ninvested. In 1907 its investments in bonds and mortgages and\r\nGovernment bonds are over $30,000.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Sanford was president from its organization until his\r\ndeath in 1900--for thirty-five years. He was succeeded by Sidney H.\r\nSanford and the latter by Nicholas L. Furman.\r\n\r\nNearly all lot enclosures have been removed, graves leveled and a\r\nfine sward maintained and treated as a lawn, without expense to the\r\nlot owners. Its picturesque appearance, fine monuments and well kept\r\ngrounds command the admiration of its visitors.\r\n\r\n_Water-Works._--The village was first supplied with water in 1872.\r\nThe brook running north through the Thomas Welling and P. E. Sanford\r\nfarms to the Wawayanda creek furnishes the supply, and is called\r\nMistucky. This name is an Indian one, from an Indian village located\r\nnear the reservoirs, originally called Miskoutucky, signifying red\r\nhills or plains.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 preparations were made for the building of a dam of 131 feet\r\nacross this brook, which when completed made a reservoir of 1 90/100\r\nacres on the Welling farm and 1 50/100 acres on the Sanford farm,\r\nboth of which pieces of land were acquired by the village. Upon the\r\ncompletion of the work and the introduction of water in the village,\r\na celebration took place in honor of the event in January, 1872.\r\n\r\nThis reservoir is situated one and a half miles south from the\r\ncenter of the village and covers over three acres of land, with a\r\ncapacity of eight million gallons of water. The works were\r\nconstructed at a cost of $25,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the village had outgrown the old supply and steps were taken\r\nto increase the same. Accordingly a second reservoir was constructed\r\nabout a quarter of a mile to the south of the first dam, with a\r\ncapacity of thirty million gallons.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 the sum of $23,000 was appropriated for the enlargement of\r\nwater mains and the construction of new ones.\r\n\r\n_Fire Department._--The fire department consists of two hose\r\ncompanies--Excelsior No. 1 and Raymond Hose Company, and the Goodwill\r\nHook and Ladder Company. The fire council consists of the chief\r\nengineer and two warders elected from each of the companies.\r\nInspection day is held each year in the month of September, at which\r\ntime the rooms and apparatus of the various companies are inspected\r\nby the president and trustees of the village, and a parade of the\r\nwhole department takes place.\r\n\r\n_Grand Army of the Republic._--A post of the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic was organized at Warwick on November 16, 1885, with\r\nthirty-three charter members. James W. Mullery was commander, and the\r\npost was named for Michael Mullery, a brother of the commander, who\r\nserved in a New Jersey regiment. The number of the post is 575.\r\n\r\nSome years after its organization the name was changed to John J.\r\nWheeler Post, in honor of Colonel John J. Wheeler, a native of the\r\ntown of Warwick, who served with honor and distinction in the 56th\r\nNew York Regiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wm. B. Sayer House, Warwick, Erected, 1766]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. TOWN OF WAWAYANDA.\r\n\r\nBy Charles E. Stickney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Wawayanda is a corruption of the general salutation between\r\nwhite settlers and Indians in pioneer times. This we take to be\r\nillustrated by the example given in Gabriel Thomas' \"East and West\r\nJersey,\" published in 1698. He evidently was familiar with the Indian\r\nlanguage and lived in Philadelphia where he was a frequent\r\nparticipant in the conversations when a white man and an Indian met.\r\nHe reports it as follows: \"When meeting, the white man would say in\r\nthe Indian language 'Hitah takoman?' (Whence comest thou?) The Indian\r\nwould reply, 'Andagowa a nee weekin' (over yonder). Then the white\r\nman, 'Tony andagowa a kee weekin?' (Where yonder?) The broad Indian\r\naccent coupled with the recurrence of the words 'over yonder' was\r\nvery probably the true derivation of the word 'Wawayanda.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is not much doubt that the town of Wawayanda was formed out of\r\nMinisink for political reasons. In 1849 the board of supervisors in\r\nOrange County was Whig by a considerable majority. The town of\r\nMinisink was and had been considered Democratic for a long time.\r\nNevertheless that year Daniel Fullerton, a Whig, was elected\r\nSupervisor of Minisink. By taking off the northern part of Minisink\r\nthe Whigs hoped to be able to elect the officials in the new town\r\nuniversally. Dr. D. C. Hallock made a survey for it. The signers of\r\nthe petition were mostly Whigs. November 27th, Mr. Fullerton made the\r\nmotion in the board of supervisors for the division of the town and\r\nthe creation of the new town to be called Wawayanda. The motion\r\ncarried by a strict party vote of ten Whigs for, to five Democrats\r\nagainst it. The name was selected from the old Wawayanda patent, with\r\nout any particular reference to its meaning. The town has ever since\r\nbeen mostly Democratic in its elections. At the first election in the\r\nspring of 1850, $200 was ordered raised for roads and bridges.\r\n\r\nThe population of the town in 1855, the first census taken after it\r\nwas formed, showed it to contain 2,069 inhabitants. Ten years later\r\nit had 1,906, a decrease of 163. In 1905, the last census taken, it\r\nhad 1,574, a decrease since the first census of 1855 (fifty years) of\r\n495. There were only 34 aliens in the last census.\r\n\r\nThe assessment of this town in 1865 was 19,677 acres, valued at\r\n$706,250. and in 1906, forty-one years later, its assessment was\r\n20,175 acres, valued at $695,060, and in 1907 it was the same. The\r\ntown expenses in 1907 were $1,067.88, besides $2,250 for highways and\r\n$400 for bridges.\r\n\r\n                   THE DROWNED LAND WAR.\r\n\r\nA feature of the towns of Minisink and Wawayanda is the Drowned\r\nLands. These comprise the valley of the Wallkill, or, as named by the\r\nIndians, the \"Twischsawkin,\" extending from Hamburg, N. J., to Denton\r\nin this State. The westerly part of that valley is the part of it in\r\nthe territory of which we write. When the Wallings, who, so far as we\r\ncan ascertain were the first permanent settlers at the head and on\r\nthe west shore of these drowned lands, located here, they found them\r\ncovered with water the greater part of each year, and of little value\r\nexcept for grazing purposes, and for the wood upon them. Their total\r\nacreage was about 40,000 acres, of which 10,000 acres were in New\r\nJersey. From the high grounds of the west shore to the river the\r\ndistance will average about half a mile. The great Cedar Swamp on the\r\neastern shore of the lands comprised about 15,000 acres. It was\r\ncovered with water more or less the year round, and, when the ice was\r\nstrong enough in winter, farmers drove for many miles to it to get a\r\nsupply of rails and wood. In spring floods the water was often from\r\neight to twenty feet deep over the entire drowned lands. They were\r\nthe homes of innumerable flocks of wild geese and ducks, and the\r\nflocks were often composed of thousands of members. They raised\r\ntheir young by thousands in the great swamps. Fish were also very\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 the farmers who owned lands along this vast morass, as well\r\nas the rich speculators who had bought, for a trifle, huge tracts of\r\nit, agitated the plan for a drainage. They got up petitions and\r\nappealed to the legislature for help so persistently, that, in 1807,\r\nthat body passed an act authorizing money to be raised to drain the\r\ndrowned lands. The act empowered five commissioners to be elected\r\nannually in Goshen. They were to assess property owners along the\r\ndrowned lands for expenses.\r\n\r\nA large ditch was dug by them from Turtle Bay (a wide and deep place\r\nin the river opposite the present farm of Reeves B. Wickham and the\r\nformer Van Bomel farm), to the junction of Rutger's Creek with the\r\nWallkill, a distance of about two miles in a direct line up stream.\r\nThe intention was for this ditch to carry the river's water mainly,\r\nespecially at high tides. Other work was done, so that in nineteen\r\nyears it is estimated that $40,000 had been expended. Little good\r\nresulted from it, for the ditches rapidly filled with mud. The ruins\r\nof this ditch are easily traced at this time.\r\n\r\nGabriel N. Phillips was then the owner of the great woolen factory\r\nand an immense dam at what is now called New Hampton, but which was\r\nthen called Phillipses'.\r\n\r\n                      MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Railroad, completed through New Hampton in 1835, caused that\r\nvillage to become a business place. Many farmers who then brought\r\ntheir produce to Goshen for shipment, changed to New Hampton and some\r\nlarge business houses started up. The large manufactories which soon\r\nstarted in Middletown and the completion of railroads from Sussex\r\nCounty, N. J., to New York, drew off trade and New Hampton is to-day\r\nof less importance than it was in former days.\r\n\r\nDenton, named from the family that founded it, has been subject to\r\nmuch the same influences as New Hampton. It is about three-quarters\r\nof a mile southwest of the latter place. Once there were drug stores,\r\nhotels and a vigorous church there. Under the local option law there\r\nhave been no licenses for hotels issued in Wawayanda for the past\r\ntwenty-five years. The business of Denton has, like other villages,\r\ndrifted away from it.\r\n\r\nCenterville, now called South Centerville, was named from its central\r\nlocation in the old town of Minisink. Its trade has, much like that\r\nof other villages in proximity to Middletown, very much lessened of\r\nlate years.\r\n\r\nSlate Hill is one of the very early settled places in this town. It\r\nwas before the days of post-offices called Brookfield. Some say that\r\nthis name was adapted from the circumstance of a brook winding around\r\nthe village.\r\n\r\nRidgeberry, named from the high ridge east of it, famous for berries,\r\nwas an early settled place and once had two hotels, two stores, two\r\nchurches and was quite a business place. Owing to the same causes\r\nwhich have taken away the trade of many other villages, Ridgeberry\r\nhas now only one good store.\r\n\r\nThe Old School Baptist Church at Slate Hill deserves more than a\r\npassing notice. Built over 100 years ago it stands there to-day as it\r\nwas built, but its congregation has nearly melted away. We give it a\r\nmore extended notice elsewhere. The Methodists have a chapel in the\r\nvillage and conduct services weekly. The Presbyterians have purchased\r\na site for a church in the village and it is only a question of time\r\nwhen an edifice will be built upon it. Millsburg on Boudinot's Creek,\r\nand Gardnersville on Rutger's Creek, are shorn to a great extent of\r\ntheir former glory. The Manning Company has feed and saw mills at the\r\nlatter place, while in the former place the mills of Frank Mead are\r\nits distinguishing features.\r\n\r\nThe first town meeting held in the town after its organization was at\r\nthe hotel of D. C. Hallock in Brookfield-Slate Hill in the spring of\r\n1850. This was in the building now occupied by Kinney Skinner as a\r\nstore. The other hotel, then kept in the place, was on the opposite\r\ncorner now owned by Dr. F. D. Myers as a private dwelling. That hotel\r\nwas then kept by William Bell. There was then no fence in the space\r\nbetween the hotels and the square was often the scene of lively\r\nscraps in the good old days.\r\n\r\nAn Indian, Keghgekapowell, one of the granters of the Evans patent\r\nunder Governor Dongan, was commonly called by the whites \"Jo-Gee.\"\r\nAfter signing away his rights to the lands under that patent he moved\r\nto the foot of the hill, about a mile and a half west of what is now\r\nBrookfield-Slate Hill, and resided there for some years. The hill in\r\nthe rear of his wigwam became known as \"Jo-Gee\" from that\r\ncircumstance. A spring by his wigwam furnished him water, and an\r\napple tree which he is said to have set there, bore fruit for several\r\ngenerations after his departure. The fruit was of a peculiar variety\r\nand excellent. He is reported to have been a good old man and kept up\r\nhis friendship for the whites until a party of his tribe came on a\r\nvisit and coaxed him to go away with them, which was the last seen of\r\nhim in this town.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of pot and pearl ashes was an important industry in\r\nthe early history of the town. Benjamin Smith was engaged in it\r\nduring and after the Revolution.\r\n\r\nTanneries were once of much importance in the industries of the town.\r\nThere were at least two in Greenville at one time, one in Minisink,\r\nand a large one for those times, in Brookfield-Slate Hill, in the\r\neighteenth century. The one in Slate Hill was where Elijah Cock now\r\nhas his Creamery and where Samuel Hornbeck resides. The last\r\nproprietor of it was Holloway W. Stephens. He was a justice of the\r\npeace in 1851.\r\n\r\nIn those early days it took a full year to tan a cow skin, an art now\r\nperformed in a few days.\r\n\r\nThere is not a tannery in existence in this locality now.\r\n\r\nBesides tanning, previously mentioned, two other important industries\r\nhave passed out of existence in these towns--milling and distilling.\r\nWhen the white settlers first invaded this country they did as the\r\nIndians did, pounded their corn and grain into flour by means of\r\nwooden mortars and stone pestles which the Indians taught them to\r\nuse; but in a short time grist mills were erected and a little later\r\nmilling grew to be a great part of the work of part of the\r\npopulation. Large mills were at one time in Gardnersville,\r\nDolsontown, Waterloo Mills, Unionville, Brookfield, and Millsburg.\r\nOld millers remembered were: The Gardners, Christian Schultz, Peter\r\nKimber, John Racine, James C. and Adirondam Austin. The course of\r\ntrade has now caused all the flour to be purchased of western\r\nmillers, and the old mills are now closed or simply used to grind\r\ncow and horse feed. Frank Mead's, at Millsburg, is now the only\r\nflouring mill in the town. In those first days whiskey was a common\r\nbeverage in almost every family, and when visitors came it was\r\nconsidered a breach of hospitality to neglect to set out a glass of\r\nit for the guests. It sold then, as we find from old account books,\r\nat about seventy-five cents a gallon. Distilleries abounded\r\neverywhere. But there came a time when taxes were laid heavily on\r\ndistillers, and the price of liquor was put up by the action of the\r\ntaxes. In consequence the distilleries dropped out one by one, until\r\nnow only one remains in Wawayanda, near Centreville; and one in\r\nMinisink, near Johnson's.\r\n\r\n                     WAWAYANDA CHURCHES.\r\n\r\nThe Baptist church of Brookfield (now Slate Hill) executed a\r\ncertificate of organization at the house of Lebbeu Lathrop, which,\r\nwe have been informed, was then in the village, December 15, 1791.\r\nIsaac Finch, John Fenton and Benjamin Smith were the trustees.\r\nPrevious to that date several members had, in July, 1783, stated to\r\nthe Warwick church, in an application, that they lived west of the\r\nWallkill and desired to be set off as a separate church. August 28,\r\n1783, Elder Benedict, of Warwick, with two brethren named Sillshee,\r\ncame west of the Wallkill, baptized seven members, and constituted\r\nthe church. A brother named Clark was ordained the next day to preach\r\nfor the new church. The meetings of the congregation were held at\r\nprivate houses and in barns to suit convenience until 1792.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1791. John Hallock, whose lands extended from his\r\nresidence, a mile south of Ridgeberry, across the flats and to\r\nBrookfield, deeded a lot to the church for its use. In 1792 the new\r\nmeeting house was erected on the lot. In those days the difference\r\nbetween the meaning of church (an organization for religious worship)\r\nand the building used for meeting purposes was clearly defined, and\r\nthe edifice was called a meeting house invariably. The building at\r\nfirst was without a steeple and just as it stands to this day,\r\nexcept it now has a steeple. The steeple was added to it in 1828. The\r\nchurch interior is to-day just as it was first built and should be\r\npreserved as an excellent specimen of old-time architecture.\r\n\r\nA Congregational church was organized in Ridgeberry in 1792, which\r\nheld until 1817, when it was changed to Presbyterian. The regular\r\norganization of the church dates from November 27, 1805, when a\r\ncertificate of it was filed at the house of Jonathan Bailey in\r\nRidgeberry.\r\n\r\nThe next oldest church organization to Ridgeberry was the\r\nPresbyterian as Centerville. This was incorporated April 5, 1827. The\r\nchurch edifice was built and dedicated in 1829.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian church of Denton was organized and dedicated in\r\n1839.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist Episcopal church, at what is now called South\r\nCenterville, was incorporated September 8, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTOWN OF WOODBURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe town of Woodbury is located in the southeast section of Orange\r\nCounty. Bounded on the north by the towns of Blooming Grove and\r\nCornwall, on the east by the town of Highland, on the south by\r\nRockland County and the town of Tuxedo, while the town of Monroe\r\nforms its western boundary. It has an area of 23,839 acres, and the\r\ntitle to the soil is mainly derived through the Chesekook patent. The\r\nassessed valuation of real estate in the town in 1907 was $802,371.\r\n\r\n_Topography._--A striking feature of the town is the continuous\r\nvalley extending from the northern to the southern boundary which\r\ndivides the town into nearly equal parts, and which has been made the\r\nline of the Newburgh short-cut branch of the Erie railroad, and of\r\nthe new State road. Through this valley flows Woodbury Creek\r\nnorthward, uniting in the town of Cornwall with Moodna Creek. Not far\r\nsouth of the sources of Woodbury Creek are the headwaters of the\r\nRamapo, which flows southward through the town of Tuxedo. The summit\r\nbetween these two valleys is low, and the rivulets of the two streams\r\nflowing in opposite directions are found very near to each other. The\r\neastern portion of the town is drained by Popolopen Creek in the town\r\nof Highlands. Numerous ponds of surpassing beauty are within the town\r\nlimits, of which Cromwell, Forest and Cranberry Lakes are the\r\nlargest.\r\n\r\nThe Schunnemunk Mountains, appropriately described as the \"high hills\r\nto the west of the Highlands,\" extend along the northwestern boundary\r\nof the town and are divided longitudinally by the boundary line of\r\nBlooming Grove and Woodbury. This was the original dividing line\r\nbetween the Wawayanda and Chesekook patents, and also one of the\r\nmonuments in the line of the Evans patent. This range has an\r\nelevation of from 1,300 to 1,600 feet. Eastward across the valley\r\nfilling out to a section of the southeast border of the county and\r\nforming a portion of the Highlands, is a battlement of mountainous\r\nelevations, including Pine Hill, Black Cap, Cranberry Hill,\r\nStockbridge, Stevens, Goshen, Letter-rock and Black Mountains.\r\n\r\n                EARLY SETTLEMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe southeastern portion of Orange County was settled mostly from the\r\nEastern States and Long Island. The families were generally of\r\nEnglish ancestry. All accounts of Revolutionary times indicate a\r\npopulation of considerable numbers in this territory. The Chesekook\r\npatent was granted in 1702, and there was no settlement for some\r\nyears following that date. The Smiths were in this region as early as\r\n1727, and the name Smith's Clove near the present village of Highland\r\nMills appears in the town records of Cornwall of 1765. The records of\r\nCornwall having been preserved, the following names are taken from\r\nthem as having belonged to what is now the territory of Woodbury.\r\nSolomon Cromwell and Jonathan Hallock were among the earliest\r\nsettlers. John Earle in 1765 was a chosen fence-viewer for Woodbury\r\nClove. He lived near Highland Mills. His sons were Peter, John and\r\nSolomon. Isaac and John Lamoreux are both mentioned in Cornwall\r\nrecords before the Revolution. Thomas Smith was overseer of highways\r\nin 1765. William Thorn was a justice of the peace in 1770 and lived\r\nat Highland Mills. Captain Austin Smith was chosen assessor in 1775.\r\nNicholas Townsend came from Long Island previous to the Revolution.\r\nTobias Weygant was a town officer of Monroe at the first town meeting\r\nin 1799. Jonathan Taylor, one of the first school commissioners,\r\nlived near Highland Mills, and Linus Rider lived on the \"Ridge\" west\r\nof the same hamlet. Patrick Ford lived near Woodbury Falls. His son,\r\nDavid Ford, was the father of ten children, of whom Charles T. was\r\nthe eldest. Further reference to the early settlement of this\r\nlocality is made in the historical sketch of the old town of Monroe.\r\n\r\n                    ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1863 a movement was set on foot to divide the town of\r\nMonroe into three towns. A petition was sent to the board of\r\nsupervisors, which was granted at its usual meeting. The names of the\r\nnew towns were respectively Monroe, Highland and Southfield. Monroe\r\nheld its town meeting March 22, 1864, electing Chauncey B. Knight,\r\nsupervisor. Highland did likewise, choosing its old favorite, Morgan\r\nShuit. The town of Southfield organized in the same manner, elected\r\nJosiah Patterson, supervisor. This triple division was at length\r\ndisapproved, and in 1865 the Legislature was asked to overrule the\r\naction of the board and reorganize the old town of Monroe. This\r\nmovement was successful.\r\n\r\nDecember 19, 1889, the board of supervisors, upon representation of\r\nthe diverse interests of different parts of the town, resolved to\r\nredivide the same into three parts. The three new towns erected were\r\nnamed respectively, Monroe, Woodbury and Tuxedo. The lines were run\r\nso as to give Monroe 12,101 acres, Woodbury 23,839 acres and Tuxedo\r\n27,839 acres. It was further resolved that the division of the town\r\nshould be made on the old lines, but that the names Woodbury and\r\nTuxedo should be substituted for Highland and Southfield. The reason\r\nadvanced for this re-division was that the town was too large and its\r\ninterests too diverse for harmonious government. In January, 1890,\r\nJohn A. Patterson represented the newly created town of Woodbury in\r\nthe board of supervisors. James Seaman was the second supervisor from\r\nthis town, Alexander Thompson the third, and William E. Ferguson, who\r\nwas elected November, 1907, the fourth. The town hall is located at\r\nHighland Mills, where the present town clerk, B. S. Pembleton,\r\nresides. The assessors in 1907 are Charles Jones and William Wilson,\r\nof Highland Mills, and Richard Bullwinkle, of Central Valley. The\r\nhighway commissioners are E. C. Cunningham, of Central Valley, N. B.\r\nHunter, of Highland Mills, and John H. Hunter, of Woodbury Falls. The\r\njustices of the peace are W. M. Gildersleeve and John Rodgers, of\r\nCentral Valley, Amos W. Sutherland, of Highland Mills, and Charles E.\r\nHand, of Mountainville. The town is divided into four school\r\ndistricts, of which the Free School at Central Valley is the most\r\nimportant. A new school building is in course of construction at\r\nHighland Mills at a cost of $18,000. Places of worship include the\r\nFriends' churches at Woodbury Falls and Highland Mills, a Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church at Highland Mills and another of the same\r\ndenomination at Central Valley. A Roman Catholic church is now being\r\nerected midway between Central Valley and Highland Mills. The Society\r\nof Friends had a meeting house in Cornwall, built before 1788, and\r\nit was the only meeting house or church in that town until 1825. The\r\nmeeting house at Smith's Clove was built in 1799. After the\r\nseparation of the society in 1828, a meeting house one and a half\r\nmiles easterly of Highland Mills was built. The first Methodist\r\nEpiscopal church in the old town of Monroe was organized and duly\r\nincorporated May 2, 1829, and a church edifice soon afterward erected\r\nat Highland Mills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles T. Ford.]\r\n\r\n                       VILLAGES.\r\n\r\nCentral Valley, a noted summer resort, is the most thriving and\r\npopulous village in the town, on the Newburgh branch of the Erie\r\nrailroad. A post-office was established here December 27, 1871.\r\nAlfred Cooper was appointed postmaster and held the position many\r\nyears. Mr. J. M. Barnes received the appointment of postmaster in\r\n1885 and again in 1892. Henry T. Ford, the present incumbent,\r\nreceived the appointment July 15, 1899. Among the leading industries\r\nof the village is the Bamboo fishing Rod factory of which Reuben\r\nLeonard is superintendent. This was established by the late Hiram L.\r\nLeonard, who came to Central Valley in 1881. The Leonard rods are\r\nshipped to all parts of the world where fly-fishing is pursued. The\r\ncarriage factory of R. F. Weygant's Sons is another important\r\nindustry. It was established in 1867 by Robert F. Weygant, who died\r\nSeptember 3, 1902. He was a descendant of Michael Weigand of the\r\nRhine Palatinate, who settled at Newburgh in 1709. The sons, Frank E.\r\nand Fred, conduct the Central Valley establishment, and William M.\r\noperates the blacksmith shop and garage at Tuxedo. The flour and\r\ngrain warehouse of J. M. Barnes had an extensive trade. Mr. Barnes\r\nlocated in Central Valley in 1876, engaging in the mercantile\r\nbusiness with Alfred Cooper. In this village is located the office of\r\nthe superintendent of the Good Roads Construction Company, Mr.\r\nCharles T. Ford, who in his sixty-third year is one of the most\r\nactive citizens in the county. Many miles of good roads in Orange\r\nCounty are evidence of the splendid work accomplished under his\r\ndirection. Here also is a branch of the Arden Farms Dairy Company.\r\nBoth these enterprises are the product of Mr. E. H. Harriman, who\r\nowns extensive farms throughout this section. Mr. Isaac L. Noxon\r\nerected many of the beautiful homes and other substantial structures\r\nin and adjoining the village. He also conducted for a time a\r\nclassical boarding school. Here also was the home of the Cornell\r\nInstitute, a high-class boarding and day school of which Mr. David\r\nCornell was principal. In the fall of 1885 Tomas Estrada Palma\r\nestablished the Palma Institute over which he presided. It was a\r\nschool for boys in which they were prepared for college, English,\r\nFrench and Spanish being taught. Mr. Palma was a Cuban and in 1868\r\njoined the Revolutionists. After fighting nine years he was captured\r\nand taken to Spain, where he spent a year in prison. His first visit\r\nto Central Valley was in 1879, making his home here with Mr. David\r\nCornell. \"Falkirk,\" an institution designed and built for the special\r\ncare of patients suffering from nervous diseases, was founded by Dr.\r\nJames Francis Ferguson in 1889. Its elevated location, a mile and a\r\nhalf from the village, and the beautiful surroundings, contribute to\r\nmake an ideal home for such patients. Following the death of Dr.\r\nFerguson in 1904, the sanitarium was conducted for two years by Dr.\r\nHenry A. Ferguson and William E. Ferguson, when it was purchased by\r\nDr. Carlos F. MacDonald, who has associated with him Dr. Clarence J.\r\nSlocum as resident physician. Among the New Yorkers who occupy their\r\nhomes here during the entire year may be mentioned Mr. Edward\r\nCornell, Mr. W. E. Ferguson, Mr. Davidson, Mr. Theboldt and Mr.\r\nBullwinkle.\r\n\r\nHighland Mills is situated about a mile north of Central Valley, and\r\nis the home of the descendants of some of the earliest settlers in\r\nthis region, notably the Cromwells, Townsends and Hallocks. The place\r\ngrew up around the mills established at this point. The Townsend\r\ntannery and the Townsend flour mill were in operation many years ago.\r\nThe place was formerly known as Orange and a post-office was\r\nestablished here under that name in 1828. Mr. Vail was the first\r\npostmaster. He was succeeded by Peter Lent in 1844, and a few years\r\nlater Morgan Shuit received the appointment. It was about this time\r\nthat Mr. Shuit began taking an active interest in local politics in\r\nwhich he soon became a leader. For thirty-one years he was\r\nsupervisor of the town, and for a like period justice of the peace.\r\nFrom 1879-1880 and 1880-1881 he was a member of the State\r\nLegislature; retiring from a mercantile career in 1864, he purchased\r\nlarge tracts of farm land, and followed this vocation to the time of\r\nhis death in 1884. Among the business enterprises of the village is\r\nthe fishing line factory; the high-class livery of Tannery & Hull,\r\nwhose stables contain forty head of horses; the fish rod factory of\r\nEdward Paine, and the firms of Jarnes & Terry and Harding & Eames,\r\nbuilding contractors. The leading mercantile establishments are\r\nthose of George Cromwell, B. S. Pembleton and Albert Fitch. The\r\npresent postmaster is Henry Hallock. The only hotel in the village is\r\nconducted by George Lamoreux. Hill Crest, a fashionable summer hotel,\r\nis a mile and a half west of the village. It has accommodations for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty guests. The Cromwell Lake House, bordering on\r\nthis beautiful sheet of water, accommodates one hundred and fifty\r\nguests, and is conducted by Oliver Cromwell. The water supply for the\r\nvillages of Highland Mills and Central Valley is obtained from\r\nCromwell Lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James F. Ferguson, M.D.]\r\n\r\nWoodbury Falls is a hamlet in the north part of the town, taking its\r\nname from the falls in Woodbury Creek. It was formerly the seat of a\r\nfurnace. A post-office was established here August 11, 1874, and\r\nLewis A. Van Cleft was the first postmaster. James Seaman is the\r\npresent incumbent.\r\n\r\nThe specific details of the settlement of this region are blended\r\nwith the histories of the towns of Cornwall and Monroe, to which the\r\nreader is referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE BENCH AND BAR.\r\n\r\nBy William Vanamee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the unveiling in Goshen, September 5th, 1907, of the monument in\r\nmemory of the gallant soldiers of the 124th Regiment, erected by that\r\nmodern exemplar of medieval knighthood, that truest of men, of\r\ngentlemen and of heroes, Thomas W. Bradley, it was mentioned by one\r\nof the speakers that just forty-five years before, upon that very\r\nspot, as the regiment was about to start for the front, the stand of\r\ncolors destined to be carried by it through many a battle, was\r\npresented to it in behalf of the Daughters of Orange by Charles H.\r\nWinfield.\r\n\r\nHis noble, inspiring speech upon that occasion was fitly responded to\r\nin behalf of the regiment by David F. Gedney, then Mr. Winfield's\r\nonly rival at the Goshen bar and his acknowledged equal. The highest\r\npraise that can be bestowed upon either is that each feared for the\r\nsuccess of his cause when opposed by the other. Indeed they were\r\nnearly always opposed, for what timid, anxious client, learning that\r\nhis adversary had engaged the services of one, ever failed to suggest\r\nto his local attorney the importance of averting prospective defeat\r\nby the employment of the other. This remark of course applies chiefly\r\nto litigations arising in the Western end of the county, in which the\r\ntrials were usually held at Goshen, for in Newburgh, Stephen W.\r\nFullerton, who was admitted to the bar in 1844, just one year before\r\nMr. Gedney was admitted and two years before Mr. Winfield, had from\r\nthe first successfully challenged their supremacy in the county at\r\nlarge. Well might he do so, for while he was not the equal of\r\nWinfield in magnetism and force or of Gedney in scholarship and\r\nstyle, yet he excelled them both in acuteness, in industry and in\r\nmastery of the rules of evidence. This, then, was the great\r\ntriumvirate that forty years ago reigned supreme throughout the\r\ncounty of Orange in the affection of their associates, in the\r\nadmiration of juries and in the plaudits of the multitude--Winfield,\r\nGedney, Fullerton. All three possessed genius of an uncommon order\r\nand no court, however insensible to the graces of oratory, could\r\nwholly restrain its flights or direct its course. When the vexatious\r\ndetails of the testimony were over--for in those days the testimony\r\nwas regarded by the public as a tedious formality preparatory to the\r\ngreat event of the trial, the summing up--and when it was understood\r\nthat the addresses to the jury were to begin, the courtroom was\r\nquickly filled by people from all parts of the county, eager for the\r\nintellectual treat that was sure to follow. Winfield was wont to\r\nbegin his closing argument somewhat slowly and even laboriously. This\r\nwas due partly to the habit of his mind, which required the stimulus\r\nof exercise to quicken it to its highest exertions, but partly also\r\nto rhetorical design, by which he sought to make his subsequent\r\noutbursts of impassioned eloquence seem wholly unstudied, spontaneous\r\nand irrepressible. Indeed, they usually were. As the thought of his\r\nclient's wrongs surged in upon him, as he dwelt upon his client's\r\nright to protection or relief, or contemplated the disaster involved\r\nin defeat, his words could scarcely keep pace with the torrent of\r\nimpetuous, sincere and deep emotion on which they were upborne. He\r\nalways struck the human note which the case presented. To him a trial\r\ndid not involve a mere application of legal principles to an\r\nascertained state of facts, but to him every case, however dry,\r\nbarren or abstract, was a human drama. He saw, with the eye of\r\nimagination and the insight of genius, those forces of hate and\r\nrevenge, of greed and falsehood, of cunning and cruelty, of devotion\r\nand affection, of honor and truth, which in one form or another,\r\nsurcharge every trial, and project their palpitating figures upon the\r\nmost intensely vital, vibrant stage for which the scenes were ever\r\nset--the conscious court-room, the austere judge, the impassioned\r\nadvocates, the enthralled spectators; human life or liberty, human\r\nhappiness or despair, human rights or relations, hanging in the\r\nbalance upon a jury's nod. All this Winfield saw. In every trial the\r\npanorama of human life unfolded itself to his inspired vision. He\r\ntook the broken, confused fragments of human testimony and subjecting\r\nthem to the kaleidoscope of his own fervent, symmetrizing, mirroring\r\nimagination, they were transformed into pictures of beauty or shapes\r\nof evil, as he willed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Vanamee]\r\n\r\nIt can easily be imagined that his power over juries was well nigh\r\nirresistible. If David F. Gedney, who was so often pitted against\r\nhim, had sought to counteract his influence by the exercise of\r\nsimilar gifts, he might well have despaired of success. But happily\r\nfor himself and for the delight of juries and the bar, no advocates\r\nwere ever more unlike each other in method of argument, in point of\r\nattack, in form of expression, in appeal to the sentiments, than\r\nWinfield and Gedney. Winfield filled the eye; Gedney charmed the ear.\r\nWinfield visited upon wrong or duplicity the bludgeon blows of\r\ninvective. Gedney pierced it with the envenomed shaft of sarcasm.\r\nWinfield sought to break the armor of his adversary with the broad\r\naxe of denunciation. Gedney penetrated it with the slender arrow of\r\nwit and the fatal spear of ridicule. To Winfield language was a\r\nnecessary vehicle of thought, a familiar medium of expression. To\r\nGedney language was a divine instrument, over the responsive chords\r\nof which his master touch swept with unerring taste and classic\r\ngrace, evoking notes of exquisite harmony and images of surpassing\r\nbeauty. The words that flowed unbidden from his enchrismed lips were\r\nmusic indeed. His sentences, chaste and polished as though chiseled\r\nin the very laboratory of thought, were but the unconscious\r\nreflection of a mind steeped in the literature of every age and\r\ntongue. Even Winfield often found to his dismay that those weapons of\r\nsolid argument which would have defied all the onslaughts of the\r\ngladiator, were powerless before the arts of the magician. Not indeed\r\nthat Gedney elevated style above matter or sacrificed strength to\r\nbeauty. But in him style and matter were so delicately balanced,\r\nbeauty and strength so discreetly blended, that each borrowed from\r\nthe other and none was poorer for the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe personal characteristics of the two men were also different.\r\nWinfield loved the approbation and applause of his fellows and\r\naspired to political honors. Gedney looked out upon the world with\r\nphilosophic calm, undisturbed by its clamors and untempted by its\r\nbaubles. The only offices which he held were strictly in the line of\r\nhis profession--district attorney and county judge--while Winfield\r\nacquired a conspicuous position in Congress at a time of intense\r\npublic interest and excitement. Winfield bore defeat with impatience,\r\nGedney with equanimity. Winfield, who especially could not endure the\r\nthought of defeat by a younger adversary, often treated him with\r\nunnecessary severity; always, however, taking care to express his\r\nregret afterwards that the heat and zeal of conflict had carried him\r\ntoo far. Gedney, on the other hand, never suffered to arise the\r\noccasion for apology or regret. He disdained to use his unrivaled\r\npowers of sarcasm and ridicule at the expense of a weaker adversary,\r\nand throughout the entire course of a trial, he was scrupulous not to\r\nsay one word which might in any degree wound the sensibilities of a\r\nyounger member of the bar. Moreover, he always look pains to speak a\r\nword of encouragement and praise to the younger lawyers whenever\r\ntheir maiden efforts justified interest or respect.\r\n\r\nGedney's happiest hours were passed at his own fireside, while\r\nWinfield loved to mingle freely with his fellow men. But Winfield's\r\nchildren had died, one by one, in childhood, and it is pathetic to\r\nrecall that he sank to his long sleep while addressing little\r\nchildren on a peaceful Sunday afternoon in June, just sixty-six years\r\nafter his eyes had opened not far away on a world in which he was\r\ndestined to reap many cruel sorrows, some substantial rewards, and\r\nall the mocking, delusive delights of a transient fame.\r\n\r\nHis friend, Judge Gedney, followed him only a month later as he sat\r\nupon the porch of his home in Goshen. As together they had journeyed\r\nthrough life, sharing its burdens and its conflicts, so in death they\r\nwere not long separated, and in the manner of their summons they were\r\nalike blessed, for to neither did it come upon a bed of lingering\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nTheir lifelong friend, Judge Stephen W. Fullerton, was not so\r\nfortunate. Surviving his old associates fourteen years, he lived to\r\nsee the world march past him and to realize the bitter truth that\r\nit takes but little interest in a lawyer, however prominent, popular\r\nor useful he may have been, after his activities and usefulness have\r\nceased. And yet Judge Fullerton possessed some traits of character\r\nwhich should have ensured him, above all his fellows, from the sharp\r\ntooth of either ingratitude or neglect. He actually gave away three\r\nfortunes. His generosity knew no bounds. An appeal to his sympathies\r\nwas never made in vain. A claim put forward in the name of friendship\r\nwas to him sacred and admitted of no hesitation. Every consideration\r\nof selfishness or even of prudence went down before the spectacle of\r\na friend in need. It was inevitable that a nature so generous and so\r\nconfiding should often be imposed upon by unworthy claims, but to\r\nthese he never referred with bitterness or even regret. A few dear\r\nfriends, including especially Judge Hirsch berg and Walter C. Anthony,\r\nwere true and faithful to the last, and it must be a satisfaction to\r\nthem to know that their loyal, undeviating attachment cheered and\r\nconsoled the last hours of a lawyer who once shared with Winfield and\r\nGedney undisputed preeminence at the bar of Orange County.\r\n\r\nFor never were tender, affectionate and generous traits of\r\ncharacter--often assumed to be inconsistent with the coldness and\r\nsternness of the law--joined to a more severe, patient, thorough,\r\ncomprehensive training in the law than in the case of Judge\r\nFullerton. To him the law was a science and the practice of it an\r\nart demanding the sleepless pursuit and worship of its votaries. To\r\nthe principles of such a science and the rules of such an art, having\r\nfor their object the most exalted end of all organized society, the\r\nestablishment of truth and the maintenance of justice, he was willing\r\nto consecrate the noblest energies of his mind and heart. To him no\r\nlabor was too hard, no sacrifice too great to deter him from\r\nmastering the minutest details of a complicated case or from\r\nascertaining and applying the principles by which it should be\r\ngoverned. When he came to court to present it every form in which\r\ndifficulty might be apprehended or obstacles interposed had been\r\nanticipated and provided for. He always tried the case on both sides\r\nbefore he went to court, and his opponents never raised many of the\r\npoints which he, in his anxious survey, had most dreaded. His\r\nthorough knowledge of the rules of evidence enabled him to introduce\r\ntestimony upon some minor issue in the case which was afterwards used\r\nwith telling effect upon the main issue. In his addresses to the jury\r\nhe discarded every appeal to mere sentiment and sought to impress\r\nonly their reason and their judgment. His analysis of the evidence\r\nwas so close and perfect, his presentation of it so clear and\r\nconvincing that the jury were led to think that his was the view they\r\nhad taken of it all the time it was being given. Gathering up the\r\ndifferent threads of narrative in the case he wove them together in a\r\nstrand of pitiless, impervious, cohesive logic that not all the\r\nfrantic efforts of his adversary could avail to unwind. Such was the\r\nman who, like Gedney, had also been county judge and district\r\nattorney of the county, to whom Mr. Marsh, as the spokesman of the\r\nOrange County bar, paid fitting tribute at the Newburgh court house\r\nin June, 1902--Luther R. Marsh who at the time of his own death in\r\n1903, constituted the last lingering tie between the present and the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nNo history of Orange County is complete that fails to chronicle the\r\ntwelve years' residence of Luther R. Marsh, who imparted luster to\r\nevery scene in which he mingled, dignity to every spot in which he\r\nlingered. He spent in Middletown the closing years of a life which\r\nhad been marked by the most intense ardor and activity in his\r\nprofession, and, though he had retired from active practice when he\r\nsettled in Orange County, he was drawn into court after that upon two\r\noccasions in litigations arising in the county. The intimate friend\r\nall his life of Orange County's ablest sons, from the Hoffmans to the\r\nFullertons, he became the friend, the companion, the idol of a new\r\ngeneration of its lawyers when he came to Middletown in 1889, being\r\nthen nearly eighty years of age. For though he lived to be ninety, he\r\nnever became old, worn or feeble in spirit. In a public speech\r\ndelivered a few months before his death, he declared that to be the\r\nhappiest period of his life. In his daily walk and conversation he\r\nexemplified the philosophy of Rabbi Ben Ezra, as expressed by\r\nBrowning:\r\n\r\n                 \"Grow old along with me!\r\n                     The best is yet to be,\r\n           The last of life, for which the first was made;\r\n                   Our times are in His hand\r\n                   Who saith 'A whole I planned,\r\n                  Youth shows but half;' trust God; see all,\r\n                        Nor be afraid!\"\r\n\r\nNor was he afraid. His daring vision sought to pierce the secrets of\r\nthe hereafter. For a long time before his death he was deeply\r\ninterested in spiritual phenomena and in the investigation of those\r\nmanifestations of persistent personal energy after death, the\r\nauthenticity of which constitutes the only proof we can ever obtain\r\nof the doctrine of immortality. Trained to estimate the weight and\r\nvalue of evidence, engaged during his entire professional career in\r\nconvincing arguments as to its proper construction and effect, he\r\naccepted as sufficient and satisfactory the evidence adduced to him\r\nof communications and impressions still conveyed, as the church even\r\nnow maintains they were of old, from those who have passed on to the\r\nspirit world.\r\n\r\nBut, though during his later years he clearly saw how trivial were\r\nthe ordinary ambitions and pursuits of men; though his thoughts\r\nbecame more and more centered upon things spiritual and eternal, yet\r\nhe never lost his interest in the sterling values and, above all, in\r\nthe beautiful friendships of life. Childhood, youth and manhood held\r\neach its claim upon his tender regard, his ready understanding, his\r\nnever-failing sympathy. To him more than to any man I ever knew do\r\nGoldsmith's immortal lines apply:\r\n\r\n       \"E'en children followed, with endearing wile,\r\n        And plucked his gown, to share the good man's smile.\r\n        His ready smile a parent's warmth exprest;\r\n        Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distrest;\r\n        To them his heart, his love, his griefs, were given,\r\n        But all his serious thoughts had rest in Heaven:\r\n        As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,\r\n        Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm.\r\n        Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,\r\n        Eternal sunshine settles on its head.\"\r\n\r\nLuther R. Marsh was unquestionably the most original, brilliant,\r\nfascinating, prolific, versatile genius that ever dwelt in Orange\r\nCounty during the years in which in him it \"entertained an angel\r\nunawares.\" He mingled on equal terms with the greatest men of his\r\ngeneration. He was a partner of Daniel Webster. Among my most\r\ncherished possessions is the tin sign which Mr. Marsh had framed and\r\nhanging for many years in his study, bearing in his own handwriting\r\nthe inscription:\r\n\r\n                       \"Luther R. Marsh.\r\n\r\n\"In 1845, on Mr. Webster's retirement from business to return to the\r\nSenate of the United States, I took this sign off from our office\r\ndoor, 44 Wall Street, New York, where it had been during our\r\npartnership.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Webster was dying in 1852, Henry J. Raymond, the gifted editor\r\nof the New York Times, wrote:\r\n\r\n\"My Dear Marsh:--We hear from Marshfield that Mr. Webster cannot live\r\nthrough the day. I want from you, if it is possible, for to-morrow\r\nmorning, an article--of what kind you know a good deal better than I\r\ncan tell you. . . . No man in this city certainly can do it so well.\r\nNine o'clock this evening, or even ten, will be early enough to have\r\nit here.\r\n\r\n               \"Yours as ever,\r\n                   H. J. Raymond.\"\r\n\r\nThe article, occupying over four columns, was there on time. Mr.\r\nMarsh, that afternoon, upon a moment's notice, at a single stroke,\r\nthrew off an estimate of Webster's genius and achievements that never\r\nwas excelled later, even in the glowing, studied periods of Everett,\r\nWinthrop, and Curtis.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1869, Henry J. Raymond died, Mr. Marsh was invited to become\r\nhis successor, but he declined the honor fearing that the position,\r\nthough congenial to his tastes, would be too exacting in its demands.\r\nWhen we consider that at this time Mr. Marsh was besieged by clients\r\nand immersed in cases; when we consider, too, that a busy lawyer is\r\nthe last one to whom a publisher would naturally turn (for there is\r\nno class of men in whom the truly literary instinct combined with the\r\ngift of literary expression is so rare as among successful lawyers),\r\nthis recognition of the unique literary distinction which Mr. Marsh\r\nhad attained, even while engaged in the fiercest legal contests with\r\nsuch hard-headed lawyers as David Dudley Field, John Van Buren,\r\nCharles O'Conor, James T. Brady, John K. Porter and Judge Comstock is\r\nmost impressive and conclusive. But in his forensic contests the\r\nlawyer dominated the _litterateur._ Any opponent who thought that\r\nbecause of Mr. Marsh's finished, faultless, elegant literary style he\r\nwould escape hard blows and sturdy onslaughts soon learned his\r\nmistake. He was, at about the time he received this offer from the\r\n_Times,_ in the very zenith of his powers and his fame. Mr. Hunt, then\r\nthe superintendent of public schools in Massachusetts, thus wrote in\r\n1873, of a trial he had just attended, in which Mr. Marsh was opposed\r\nto Joseph H. Choate:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John C. R. Dayton]\r\n\r\n\"I shall never forget the spectacle of that trial; from the opening\r\nto the close, it was the most perfect thing I ever saw. Having\r\nentered upon the study of law in the late William Pitt Fessenden's\r\noffice; having seen many able lawyers conduct cases in court--Fessenden\r\nand Evans in Maine, Rufus Choate and other great lawyers in Boston,\r\nand, in the South, Yancey and others--allow me to say that I never saw\r\nanything to be compared with the ease, dignity and power with which Mr.\r\nMarsh managed everything.\"\r\n\r\nBut his splendid gifts and varied powers could not be restricted in\r\ntheir exercise to the energies of the law and the graces of\r\nliterature. Equally fitted to shine in society or among scholars, in\r\npulpit or press, on the rostrum or in the forum; always _facile\r\nprinceps_ as poet or preacher, essayist or journalist, publicist or\r\nphilanthropist, advocate or orator, his un-approached range and\r\nversatility mark him indisputably as the Admirable Crichton of his\r\nland and age.\r\n\r\nDuring the period covered by Mr. Marsh's impressive eulogy upon the\r\ncharacter and attainments of his friend Stephen W. Fullerton, the\r\nOrange County bar was enriched by the weight, the influence and the\r\nlearning of a group of lawyers whose temperament disinclined them to\r\nthe fierce excitements, the rude conflicts, the temporary triumphs of\r\nthe forum. Foremost among them was Eugene A. Brewster, who, though he\r\npersonally argued his cases with great ability and success before the\r\nappellate courts, where reason and reserve count for more than fervor\r\nand fluency, was unskilled in the art of swaying a jury against its\r\nwill or snatching a verdict against the evidence. Mr. Brewster's warm\r\nadmiration for his great preceptor, Judge John W. Brown, may have\r\nunconsciously influenced his bearing, but his moral and intellectual\r\nequipment was entirely his own. This embraced a deep sense of the\r\nresponsibility resting upon every lawyer to sustain the honor and\r\ndignity of an ancient and honorable profession. He scrupulously\r\nmaintained throughout a busy and active career the high ideals with\r\nwhich he started out. His aim was to ascertain the truth, not to\r\ncircumvent it; to apply the law, not to evade it; to draw from the\r\nfountains of justice, not to pollute them. He enjoyed the respect of\r\nthe courts, of his brethren and of the public because of his\r\ncharacter as well as his ability, his virtues as well as his talents.\r\nHis whole life was a steady influence working for honesty in the\r\nmoral fibre of the community; a persistent power making for\r\nrighteousness; a never-failing light guiding to the path of safety\r\nand of honor. In him were incarnated those conserving principles,\r\nthose formative influences, those stimulating ideals, those ennobling\r\ntraditions which impart dignity to human life, strength to human\r\ncharacter, stability to human society.\r\n\r\nDavid A. Scott was another eminent member of the same group. As\r\nsurrogate of the county for two terms his administration was\r\ndistinguished by an unusual display of those qualities of breadth,\r\nwisdom, patience, knowledge of human nature and capacity for affairs\r\nso peculiarly requisite in a probate judge exercising jurisdiction\r\nover the saddest controversies, disclosures and scenes ever presented\r\nfor adjudication--contested wills, disputed claims, angry\r\naccountings, recrimination between brother and sister, calumniation\r\nof the dead, sordid passions and petty avarice disrupting old\r\nfriendships and family ties. In calming these dissensions whenever\r\npossible and in deciding them whenever necessary Judge Scott\r\nmanifested that happy blending of tact, temper, common sense, sound\r\njudgment, practical sagacity and professional learning so essential\r\nin the office of surrogate. I say judge because the title surrogate\r\nis a most unfortunate one. The office is known in other commonwealths\r\nas that of probate judge. People are so influenced by mere names that\r\nif such were the title here the claims of an able surrogate to public\r\nrespect would be more fully understood. When it is considered that\r\nonce in every generation the entire wealth of the county, including\r\nvast fortunes amassed elsewhere by those who die residing in it, is\r\nadministered upon in this court and that nearly all the intricate and\r\nperplexing questions involved in its distribution are passed upon by\r\nthe surrogate, it will readily be seen that the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of this office are among the most important,\r\nextensive and onerous that can devolve upon judicial officers.\r\n\r\nIt is now nearly fifty years since David A. Scott entered upon the\r\nduties of this office. There are those who still remember the dignity\r\nand grace with which he discharged them. It is forty years since he\r\nlaid them down. One year after the close of his second official term\r\nand one year after Judge Michael H. Hirschberg had been admitted to\r\nthe bar, they entered into a partnership under the name of Scott &\r\nHirschberg, which continued until Mr. Scott's death. What this long,\r\nclose association meant to the younger member of the firm he alone\r\nfully knows. Surely he would be the last to repel the suggestion that\r\nit doubtless profoundly influenced a character still sensitive and\r\nimpressionable when the intimacy began. Indeed he himself bore\r\naffectionate testimony to this impress when, in the court\r\nproceedings, held to honor his dead friend's memory, he said: \"For\r\nmore than twenty-one years we have labored together side by side in\r\nthe perfect intimacy and union of the partnership relation, and\r\nrealizing how very much I am indebted to his precepts, his example\r\nand his support; with only sweet and grateful memories of that\r\nconnection now remaining, wholly unalloyed by even the momentary\r\nshadow of doubt or distrust, and un-vexed by even an occasional\r\nsuggestion of discord or dissension--indeed one long and unbroken\r\nperiod of harmonious intercourse, of joint and cheerful endeavor, and\r\nof undisturbed confidence and esteem, I deem it a duty no less than a\r\nprivilege to add my humble meed of praise to the chorus of eulogy\r\nwhich I am sure will greet his memory to-day.\"\r\n\r\nIn closing his tribute Judge Hirschberg said, with the heartfelt\r\nconcurrence of the entire bar:\r\n\r\n\"And so passed away forever an honorable lawyer, a faithful friend, a\r\nloving father, an estimable citizen, a good man. We will all miss his\r\nfamiliar form, his friendly greeting, and his kindly presence. Let\r\nhis virtues be commemorated in the records of the court. Let the\r\nsweet and wholesome fragrance of his memory remain, to inspire\r\nlawyers, living and to come, to emulate his upright deeds, and to con\r\nthe lasting lessons of his pure and simple life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now as we pause in the contemplation of this fine and beautiful\r\ncharacter there rises before the mind another figure associated with\r\nthe days of Winfield and Gedney in Goshen; of Fullerton, Brewster and\r\nScott in Newburgh--the figure of James G. Graham. It is difficult to\r\nclassify him in either group to which reference has been made. A\r\nconstitution naturally delicate led him to shrink from the strife and\r\nturmoil of sharply contested trials and to prefer the seclusion of\r\nhis office and his library. Yet no lawyer of the period under\r\nconsideration approached him in the kind of oratory adapted to\r\npublic and ceremonious occasions. Indeed James G. Graham stands in a\r\ngroup or class alone. None but himself could be his counterpart, for\r\nhe was compacted of every creature's best. In serenity he was equal\r\nto Scott, in strength to Winfield. In counsel he was as wise as\r\nBrewster, in speech as gifted as Gedney. While in vigor of expression\r\nhe may be compared to Winfield and in felicity of style to Gedney,\r\nyet he excelled them both in a certain tender grace, a poetic touch,\r\na romantic spell, an iridescent play of fancy and sentiment which\r\nwere the spontaneous reflection of an ardent, imaginative, spiritual\r\ntemperament, united to and controlled by exquisite literary taste.\r\n\r\nHe never received, either in life or in death, the public recognition\r\ndue to his splendid gifts and exalted character. He was ever generous\r\nin his own praise of substantial worth. His tributes to his departed\r\nbrethren were marked by peculiar elevation of thought and tenderness\r\nof sentiment. A work professing to be history, seeking to readjust\r\nthe balances in which the superficial judgment of contemporaries is\r\ncorrected by the tardy recognition of posterity, should not fail to\r\nregister the star of James G. Graham in that brilliant constellation\r\nfrom which Marsh and Winfield, Gedney and Fullerton, Brewster and\r\nScott shed undying refulgence upon the traditions and memories of the\r\nOrange County bar. Let a garland of affectionate, reverent homage\r\nentwine the memory of one who never failed himself to lay a chaplet\r\nof rosemary upon the grave of friendship.\r\n\r\nTo this period also belongs Abram S. Cassedy. Admitted to practice\r\njust fifty years ago, his rise from the time that he settled in\r\nNewburgh was so rapid that he came into professional relations with\r\nthe members of both groups which have been considered, though they\r\nwere all admitted to the bar several years before. Indeed he belonged\r\nto both groups. He was emphatically what is meant by the expression\r\n\"an all-'round lawyer.\" He could work patiently and assiduously in\r\nhis office drawing contracts and giving counsel and then proceed to\r\nthe courtroom to try his cases. His knowledge of the law commanded\r\nthe respect of the courts, while his earnestness and sincerity\r\nproduced a favorable impression upon juries. He was essentially a\r\nman of affairs, equally at home in the bank directors' meeting, the\r\ncommon council, the mayor's office and the board of education. He was\r\ncorporation counsel of his city and district attorney of the county.\r\nHe was the executor of large estates and the trustee of great\r\ninterests, one of the most important of his transactions being his\r\nsale of the West Shore Railroad for the sum of $22,000,000, and his\r\ndistribution of the fund. In all the positions that he occupied and\r\nall the capacities that he filled he was animated by the very highest\r\nideals of professional honor and personal probity. In many ways the\r\ninfluence of his life and the force of his example have been more\r\npersistent and abiding in Newburgh than in the case of lawyers whose\r\nfame has been exclusively in the courts. His interesting and\r\nstainless career affords a striking illustration of the results which\r\nmay be accomplished by an acute and active mind concentrated upon one\r\nleading object and directed in its energies by a simple, sincere,\r\nstraightforward, undeviating devotion to the noblest standards of\r\npublic duty and private honor.\r\n\r\nLooming large and masterful in the second group of lawyers, the\r\nfriend and associate of Winfield, Gedney and Fullerton, who always\r\nvalued highly his legal opinions and who frequently were influenced\r\nby them, though he distrusted his own ability to cope with them in\r\ncourt, comes the figure of John G. Wilkin. Twice elected county\r\njudge, the first time in 1851 and the second time in 1883, the\r\ninterval between these elections was marked by the presence and the\r\npower of his persistent, aggressive, dominating, yet at the same time\r\nwinning, gracious, picturesque personality. Born to command, the\r\nexciting times in which he lived, covering the most painful period of\r\nour national history, tended to develop his natural powers of\r\nleadership. He had a talent for friendship. His absolute devotion to\r\nhis friends in times of adversity and defeat confirmed a leadership\r\nwhich, however, was constantly challenged by those who, because they\r\ncould not control him, sought to crush him. He tasted many a time the\r\nbitter truth of Joubert's epigram that a man who by the same act\r\ncreates a friend and an enemy plays a losing game, because revenge is\r\na stronger principle than gratitude. But Judge Wilkin never knew\r\nthat he had lost. He never accepted defeat. Like his old friend\r\nHalstead Sweet, who always began the day after election to prepare\r\nfor the next election, the hour of Judge Wilkin's defeat was the most\r\ndangerous one for his enemies. In the case of such a character,\r\ndeeply implanted with the love of power for its own sake as well as\r\nfor its rewards, it was inevitable that it should pass through many\r\nperiods of storm and trial. But if Judge Wilkin perforce bent to the\r\nstorm he never quailed before it. The deepest trial of his life was\r\none that he never foresaw. This was the failure in 1884 of the\r\nMiddletown National Bank of which he was the attorney and nominally\r\nthe vice-president. This failure, which was precipitated by the\r\nunsuspected acts of the president in giving up to a grain shipper who\r\nhad acquired a hypnotic control over his mind, two hundred thousand\r\ndollars' worth of bills of lading without the payment of the drafts\r\nto which the bills of lading were attached, came to Judge Wilkin with\r\nall the force of a cruel and crushing accident. The spirit which no\r\nopposition could daunt recoiled for a moment under the stab of\r\ntreachery. But only for a moment. Quickly recovering himself--though\r\ndeeply pained and humiliated that such a disaster should come to an\r\ninstitution with which he was connected and especially to friends who\r\nmight have been influenced by his name--the strength, the courage,\r\nthe manliness of his royal character were never more strikingly\r\nexemplified, were never shown to greater advantage than at this very\r\ntime. He never flinched from any obligation which this or any other\r\nrelation, business, political, social or professional entailed upon\r\nhim. His devotion to his clients, his determination to relieve them\r\nfrom the consequences of their own folly or imprudence was absolute\r\nand fearless, never taking any note of whether they could have\r\navoided the plight they were in. If they were in trouble through no\r\nfault of their own, of course anybody would be glad to help them. But\r\nif they were in trouble through their own fault the very addition to\r\ntheir troubles which this reflection caused them only created a\r\ndouble claim upon Judge Wilkin's sympathies and energy. This is the\r\nspirit of the true lawyer, who, when appealed to in distress, has no\r\nmore right to arrogate to himself the functions of court and jury and\r\ndecree that his client must take his punishment than a physician has\r\nto refuse to cure a disease which his patient has incurred through a\r\nviolation of the laws of health or morality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Fullerton]\r\n\r\nJudge Wilkin's interest in the young men who grew up about him never\r\ndeserted him. He welcomed their advances, he reciprocated their\r\nesteem, he enjoyed their companionship. His reminiscences of the\r\nolder bar were lively and entertaining, his sense of humor keen, his\r\nexultation in life and all its activities throbbing and intense. He\r\nwas not ready to go when the summons came and he made no hypocritical\r\npretense of resignation to it. His was a life so full of promise and\r\nperformance, passion and power, persuasiveness and preeminence that\r\nwell may we exclaim with the poet:\r\n\r\n               \"But what rich life--what energy and glow!\r\n                Cordial to friend and chivalrous to foe!\r\n                Concede all foibles harshness would reprove,\r\n                And what choice attributes remain to love.\"\r\n\r\nIf James N. Pronk had given the thought and attention to his own\r\ninterests that he gave to the interests of the public and to the\r\ndevelopment of his city he would have died wealthy and famous. In his\r\nearly manhood when, as the only lawyer in Middletown, except Judge\r\nWilkin, he acquired a large practice, he quickly accumulated a\r\nfortune sufficient to enable him to build and wholly pay for what\r\nstill remains the finest store and office block in Middletown. He had\r\nnothing to do then, in order to a successful life, but to take his\r\nease and accept such work as he might enjoy. But this was not his\r\nnature. He simply could not take his ease. He was possessed by the\r\ndesire to originate and carry forward every public enterprise that\r\nmight benefit the town. He lived plainly and simply, had no personal\r\nindulgences, spent nothing upon himself, denied himself every\r\npleasure in order that he might give himself wholly to the service of\r\nthe public. Every pleasure indeed except that of friends and books.\r\nHe loved the society of congenial spirits and he dwelt much among\r\nbooks. But he was not selfish even in this. Instead of putting the\r\nbooks he bought into his own library he put them into a public\r\nlibrary. He established the Lyceum, the fine circulating library of\r\nwhich gave to Middletown its first literary impetus. In connection\r\nwith this he organized debates in which the ablest men of the\r\ncommunity discussed every moral, social and political question of the\r\nday. These debates brought out the native talent and debating powers\r\nof many men who otherwise might have been silent, notable among them\r\nIsrael O. Beattie, whose wide information, keen reasoning and\r\nsparkling wit are well remembered by those who know how naturally his\r\ndistinguished son, Judge John J. Beattie, comes by these qualities.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Mr. Pronk brought to the platform of the Lyceum the\r\nforemost intellects of his time--Henry Ward Beecher, Wendell\r\nPhillips, Horace Greeley, Edward H. Chapin, Theodore L. Cuyler and\r\nmany others. I well remember when, a few years ago at Mohonk, Judge\r\nBeattie and I introduced ourselves to Dr. Cuyler and mentioned\r\nMiddletown, he at once exclaimed: \"How's my old friend Pronk?\" though\r\nthey had not met for forty years and he had not heard of his death.\r\n\r\nThe great mistake of Mr. Pronk's life was when he mortgaged his fine\r\nbuilding, on the income of which he might easily have lived, in order\r\nto establish what became the passion and the idol of his life,\r\nHillside Cemetery. But was it a mistake? Is it not success, after\r\nall, to live in lasting institutions? This cemetery is to-day the\r\nmost beautiful resting place of the dead in Orange County. Over this\r\nsacred spot where he himself was laid, broods ever the sentiment\r\ninscribed over the tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral of Sir Christopher\r\nWren, its architect--\"If you would behold his monument look about\r\n you.\" (_Si monumentum quaeris circumspice._)\r\n\r\nYounger than any of the lawyers thus far considered, but entering\r\nupon his professional life while theirs was still active, and dying\r\nprematurely before the close of those careers with which his own was\r\nstrictly contemporaneous, was William F. O'Neill. Perhaps no career\r\nwas ever more of a surprise to the public and to the profession than\r\nthat of Mr. O'Neill. From Winfield, Gedney and Fullerton with their\r\ndistinguished lineage, family influence, county connections, social\r\nposition, superior education, wide culture, courtly address and\r\nimposing presence much was expected and expectation was always\r\nsatisfied. But here was a young man, who coming from Monticello to\r\nstudy law in Middletown with Judge Groo and entering upon his career\r\nwithout any of these advantages, boldly flung himself into the courts\r\nto try conclusions with the ablest of Orange County's advocates and\r\nbegan at once to captivate juries and to win his cases. Small in\r\nstature, unimpressive in appearance, deficient in culture, unformed\r\nin style, averse to application, trying his cases with very\r\ninadequate preparation, the lawyers were puzzled at first to know the\r\nsecret of his immediate and enormous success at the bar. It lay, as\r\nthey soon learned, in his faculty of making the jury think that he\r\nalways happened to be on the right side. It was like the case of the\r\njuror who was descanting enthusiastically upon the magnificent,\r\nunrivaled powers of Brougham as an advocate. \"But,\" said a bystander,\r\n\"I see that you always give the verdict to Scarlett.\" \"Scarlett, O\r\nyes,\" said the juror. \"Well, you see Scarlett is always on the right\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\nMr. O'Neill was a natural verdict getter. He never went over the\r\nheads of the jury. He talked with them on their own plane of thought,\r\nsentiment and experience. Juries liked him personally. They felt\r\ninterested in his success. I remember a trial in which he obtained a\r\nverdict of $2,000 against the village of Port Jervis for a woman who\r\nhad fallen upon a defective sidewalk, but who did not appear to have\r\nbeen much injured. After the verdict, one of the jurors, Coe Goble,\r\nof Greenville, asked me what I thought of the verdict, to which I\r\nreplied that they probably gave as much as the evidence justified,\r\nsince she did not seem to be hurt much. \"Well,\" said Goble, \"it was\r\nthis way--we thought the woman ought to have $1,000 and we thought\r\nBilly ought to have $1,000.\"\r\n\r\nThis familiar, affectionate reference to him as \"Billy\" indicates his\r\nplace as a popular idol. Indeed the boyishness of his appearance and\r\nstature seemed to help him. People who saw him for the first time and\r\nwho had not expected much from him, went out of the courtroom saying,\r\n\"Did you see how little Billy O'Neill laid him out?\"\r\n\r\nMr. O'Neill made negligence cases a specialty, and he became known\r\nfar and wide as a negligence lawyer. Those who deprecate the rise of\r\nthe negligence lawyer and the increase in negligence cases during the\r\nlast forty years fail to make sufficient allowance for those changed\r\nconditions in the business of the world under which its various\r\ncurrents of capital and industry converge in one swollen stream of\r\ncorporate enterprise and control. This tends, on the one hand, to\r\nencourage professional alertness in protecting the individual from\r\ncorporate greed or neglect and, on the other hand, to create extreme\r\ndevotion to corporate interests seeking the aid of professional skill\r\nand judgment. While the zeal of attorneys in behalf of corporations\r\nis rarely condemned it is somewhat the fashion to deprecate the\r\nnegligence lawyer who takes the case of a client against a\r\ncorporation upon a contingent fee. As the client is usually destitute\r\nit is difficult to see how his case is to be presented at all unless\r\nthe attorney takes his chances upon success. As courts and juries\r\nmust determine that the claim is a worthy one before it can succeed,\r\nthe whole criterion seems to resolve itself into the position that\r\nworthy causes and clients should be deprived of a hearing. This\r\nfeeling can be well understood on the part of corporations constantly\r\ncompelled to pay damages on account of their carelessness, but the\r\nexpression of it comes with poor grace from lawyers who receive large\r\nretainers and liberal fees from wealthy clients. It is at least as\r\nfair to a client to wait for compensation until the work is done as\r\nit is to insist on a retainer before any work at all is done. It is\r\nnoticeable that the criticism upon the contingent fee at the\r\nconclusion of the case comes usually from the lawyer who expects a\r\nlarge fee at the beginning of the case.\r\n\r\nIt is simple truth and justice to say that human life and limb are\r\nsafer to-day in Orange County because that sturdy fighter and\r\ndangerous opponent, William F. O'Neill, caring not whether his\r\nclient was poor or rich, never allowed a case of negligence, once\r\nbrought to his attention, to pass unchallenged and un-presented to a\r\ncourt of justice. And if his example and his influence have\r\nencouraged others, as indeed they have, in the same path of\r\nprofessional honor and public duty, then he, too, has not lived in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Mr. O'Neill was coincident with the rise of a new\r\ngeneration of advocates who were confronted at first with a supremacy\r\nin the older bar which never could have been ousted by superior\r\ntalent. It yielded at last to the only rivals it could not resist,\r\ndecay and death, even as now the lawyers I am about to name will soon\r\nsurrender to a still later generation their coveted place and\r\nprominence in the courts. I say about to name because, notwithstanding\r\nthe considerations which suggest the omission of any reference to\r\nthe living, it seems to be inartistic and it ought to be unnecessary\r\nto break off a narrative in the middle because some of its characters\r\nare still living. Caution and delicacy may indeed discourage, if not\r\nwholly forbid such un-stinted praise as may be properly bestowed upon\r\na finished, rounded career, far removed from possible marring by some\r\nlate and regrettable error. But, on the other hand, the opinion of\r\nhis contemporaries by one who has freely mingled with them and\r\nfrequently been pitted against them ought to be accurate, and, if\r\naccurate, then interesting and valuable. How we would all enjoy now\r\nWinfield's own characterization of Samuel J. Wilkin and William F.\r\nSharpe, his partner; of Benjamin F. Duryea and Joseph W. Gott, the\r\nsenior; of David F. Gedney and Stephen W. Fullerton. There are\r\nhistories of our own times and this is one of them. Let me proceed\r\nthen, diffidently, indeed, but still unflinchingly, to perform the\r\ntask assigned to me before the subjects and the generation chiefly\r\ninterested in them have all alike passed away; appealing to the\r\njudgment of those still able to decide, upon the candor, fairness and\r\nimpartiality of the estimates. Indeed, if we wait until all\r\ncontemporaries have passed away, who is left to determine whether the\r\nestimates are just?\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Groo is older than the lawyers who came to the bar in the\r\nlate sixties, but he falls naturally in this group, because he came\r\nto Orange County in 1866, when he at once took a foremost place among\r\nits trial lawyers, his reputation having preceded him. He had already\r\nbecome leader of the bar of Sullivan County, where in 1856 he was\r\nelected its district attorney. This leadership was, in itself,\r\nevidence of great ability, for he had to win his spurs against such\r\nintellectual giants as General Niven, Judge Bush, Senator Low and\r\nJames L. Stewart. It is not strange, then, that in him Winfield,\r\nGedney and Fullerton found a match for all their powers and an equal\r\nin all the arts and accomplishment of the advocate. His perfect\r\nself-possession, his readiness in retort, his firm grasp of the\r\npoints in controversy, his unfailing memory enabling him to marshal\r\nthe testimony with crushing effect, his severe logic, his scathing\r\nenunciation, his intrepid spirit, and, above all, his moral\r\nearnestness combined to make him a dreaded and formidable adversary.\r\n\r\nJudge Groo (for he acquired the title through his election as special\r\ncounty judge of Orange County in the year 1868) has carried this\r\nquality of moral earnestness, which so largely contributed to his\r\nsuccess at the bar, into all the interests and relations of life. He\r\nearly espoused the cause of temperance and has long been one of the\r\nmost prominent members of the prohibition party, which at different\r\ntimes has bestowed upon him its complimentary but unsubstantial\r\nnomination for governor and judge of the Court of Appeals. He has\r\nalways insisted that the absolute prohibition of the sale of liquors\r\nin the State of New York is not only a righteous and necessary\r\nreform, but an entirely feasible one. The remarkable strength of this\r\nmovement in the South, followed as it has been by recent prohibitory\r\nlegislation in several of the States, is one of the cheering rewards\r\nfor unselfish, life-long devotion to principle which he is permitted\r\nto enjoy in his declining years. There is no doubt whatever that his\r\nsacrifices in behalf of this cause seriously interfered with his\r\nlater eminence at the bar, for such eminence, even when once\r\nachieved, can be maintained only by sedulous, un-relaxed devotion; by\r\nsteady, unqualified, undivided allegiance to that most exacting of\r\nall masters--the law.\r\n\r\nThis consecration to higher duties and nobler aims than those\r\ninvolved in mere professional success does not, however, constitute\r\nthe sole reason why Judge Groo ceased to be a familiar and prominent\r\nfigure in the courts of Orange County. This was due primarily to the\r\nremoval of his office to New York, where he continued to win many\r\nnotable legal triumphs until failing health compelled him to retire\r\nfrom active practice. His dignified and honorable repose is divided\r\nbetween his home in Middletown and his summer retreat in his native\r\ncounty of Sullivan at Grooville, so named in honor of one of his\r\nRevolutionary ancestors.\r\n\r\nThough Lewis E. Carr has transferred his professional activities to\r\na wider field, yet he acquired and developed in Orange County those\r\ntranscendent qualities as a trial lawyer which have since, in nearly\r\nevery county of the State, excited the astonishment of the bar and\r\nthe admiration of the courts. From the very first he produced a\r\nprofound impression upon Winfield, Gedney and Fullerton, with whom he\r\nengaged in vigorous, courageous contest at a time when it was\r\ndifficult, indeed, to stand up against their powerful and almost\r\nirresistible influence. But it was when he came to be associated with\r\nthem in some most important trials that they were even more impressed\r\nwith his knowledge of fundamental principles, his wisdom in\r\nconsultation, his mature and unerring judgment. Judge Gedney once\r\nremarked in a public tribute to Mr. Carr in his early life that it\r\nwas possible to gain a far more accurate measurement of a lawyer's\r\nreal ability through association with him than in opposition to him.\r\nHe added that it was after enjoying such opportunities to become\r\nacquainted with Mr. Carr that he was the better able to express\r\nadmiration of his surpassing talents as well as confidence in his\r\nbrilliant future. Mr. Carr has since then enjoyed many honors and\r\nsome supreme triumphs, but it is doubtful that any encomium has ever\r\ngiven him deeper pleasure than this now amply verified prediction by\r\nso competent an authority.\r\n\r\nNothing more surely attests the eminence which Mr. Carr has attained\r\nin the State than the recognition of it by the Assembly of the State\r\nof New York in inviting him to pronounce in its chamber the eulogy\r\nupon its beloved speaker, S. Frederick Nixon, upon the memorial\r\noccasion dignified by the attendance of the Governor, the Senate and\r\nthe judges of the Court of Appeals. In that august presence Mr. Carr,\r\ndefending the prerogatives of the State, said:\r\n\r\n\"However much we take pride in the nation's greatness and power we\r\ncannot shut our eyes to the fact that in some way, not easy to\r\nunderstand, the Federal Government of which we constitute no mean\r\npart, has been steadily encroaching upon the province of the State,\r\nand year by year the waves of its rising power are biting away some\r\npart of the shore on which our feet should rest. . . . Preservation\r\nof the rights of the State, as the framers of the Constitution\r\nintended and provided, is as essential to the safety, security and\r\nperpetuity of the sisterhood of States as the armies that carry and\r\ndefend the flag and the navies that patrol the sea and protect our\r\nharbors against the dangers of attack. Our State is an empire in and\r\nof itself. Dominion over it and control of its priceless interests\r\nare all our own, save to the narrow extent they were expressly\r\nyielded to give needed strength and requisite power for the\r\nprotection of the whole.\"\r\n\r\nThis extract gives some idea of the force and clearness which\r\ncharacterize all Mr. Carr's public utterances, but no extract can\r\ngive any conception of his extraordinary powers as an advocate. The\r\nassembly indeed had already enjoyed an unusual opportunity to\r\nwitness their display, for Mr. Carr was easily the most conspicuous\r\nand imposing figure in a public trial of great importance conducted\r\nbefore it, in which he made the principal and prevailing argument.\r\nBut it is perhaps in the appellate courts that Mr. Carr's abilities\r\nfind their most congenial field of exercise. There his ready command\r\nof all the resources of a trained, vigorous and richly stored\r\nintellect enables him to discuss every proposition propounded by the\r\ncourt, or advanced by his opponent, with a breadth of reasoning, a\r\nfertility of illustration, an array of authority which never fail to\r\narouse admiration and delight. Indeed in every argument or trial in\r\nwhich he engages he organizes from the outset an intellectual duel.\r\nOne who is not prepared to cope with him on equal terms, or with a\r\ncause so strong that it overcomes the intellectual handicap, will\r\nfind it prudent not to enter the lists with him.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Carr resided in Port Jervis before going to Albany, where he\r\nis the general counsel for the Delaware and Hudson Company and where\r\nhe is called as senior counsel into many important cases not at all\r\nconnected with railroad litigation, such was his devotion to his\r\nprofession that it was only in exciting political campaigns that he\r\ncould yield himself to the demands of the platform. But in Albany so\r\ninsistent and repeated have been the demands upon him that he has\r\nbeen compelled to yield more frequently, until now his reputation is\r\nfirmly established as a platform speaker of rare attractiveness. A\r\nfair example of his after-dinner oratory may be found, in fit company\r\nand enduring form, in the book entitled \"Modern Eloquence,\" edited by\r\nSpeaker Thomas B. Reed; it being a response, at the banquet of the\r\nState Bar Association, in which, with a fine blending of humor and\r\nseriousness, he commends that recent revival of an ancient custom\r\nwhich has done so much already to revive and promote the dignity of\r\nthe bench--the wearing by judges of the robe of office.\r\n\r\nThe Orange County Bar has contributed to the bar of the State many\r\ngifted sons of whom it has been, indeed, proud--Ogden Hoffman,\r\nWilliam H. Seward, William Fullerton and others--but it has never\r\ncontributed one of whose character, ability and fame it is more\r\njustly and universally proud than it is of the character, ability and\r\nfame of Lewis E. Carr.\r\n\r\nHenry Bacon is now, indisputably, the leader of the Orange County\r\nBar. His career has been marked by a singleness of devotion to his\r\nprofession rarely equaled. It was interrupted at one time by his\r\nservice for five years in the House of Representatives, in the\r\ndebates of which he bore an honorable part, impressing himself most\r\nfavorably upon the leaders of his own party and those of the\r\nopposition. But his heart was all the time in the law, which he\r\nkeenly enjoys as a science and reveres as a master. Returning to\r\nGoshen at the expiration of his congressional service he threw\r\nhimself with renewed ardor into the practice of his profession to\r\nwhich he has since applied himself with undeviating purpose,\r\npersistence and power. The position of leadership now held by him is\r\nthe natural, inevitable and only consistent result of high endeavor\r\nand unfaltering purpose united to intellectual gifts and legal\r\nqualifications of a superior order. Mr. Bacon has the legal instinct.\r\nHe is not content until he has penetrated to the heart of the\r\nmystery. He revels in a perplexing and complicated case. He loves to\r\nunravel its intricacies and explore its mazes.\r\n\r\nMr. Bacon has in the past twenty years tried more cases than any\r\nlawyer in the county. He is retained in nearly every important trial.\r\nHis manifest knowledge of every principle of the law involved in the\r\ncase always commands the respect of the court and of the bar. In\r\npresenting his views to the jury he relies upon logic rather than\r\neloquence, upon consecutive force of argument rather than the arts of\r\npersuasion. In the celebrated case of Magar vs. Hammond his opening\r\naddress to the jury upon the second trial was a masterpiece of\r\nclear, coherent, cumulative and convincing statement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. H. L. Secor]\r\n\r\nMr. Bacon is never more interested than when he is confronted with\r\nsome grave question of constitutional construction. His attack upon\r\nthe constitutionality of the drainage law, which was declared\r\ninvalid by the Court of Appeals upon the arguments advanced by him,\r\nand in which he was opposed by the eminent advocate John G. Milburn,\r\nwill be long remembered.\r\n\r\nAll lawyers are true to their clients, but Mr. Bacon's inflexibility\r\nin the assertion or defense of his client's rights is uncompromising\r\nto the last degree. It has even been said that, in his zeal and\r\nardor, he is willing to trample upon all the ties of private\r\nfriendship and all the claims of personal courtesy. But no client was\r\never heard to complain of this and, after all, the fact remains that\r\nno lawyer can serve his clients with absolute fidelity without, at\r\ntimes, wounding his neighbors and his friends. An honest lawyer can\r\nknow no one but his client and him crucified. His standard of\r\nmorality and manners, of duty and decorum is expressed in the\r\nsentiment, \"Stop pursuing my client and I have no further quarrel\r\nwith you.\" Mr. Bacon typifies this spirit and embodies this principle\r\nin his professional life more strikingly than any lawyer who has ever\r\npracticed at the bar of Orange County.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Mr. Bacon's social gifts and graces are in the\r\nhighest degree winning and attractive. One would never suspect, in\r\nthe velvet palm that greets him at his threshold, the iron hand that\r\ncrushed him but the day before in court. One would never recognize in\r\nthe beaming, graceful host the hard-headed lawyer who, with stern,\r\nunflinching purpose, will destroy him to-morrow. United in marriage\r\nto the brilliant and accomplished daughter of one of America's\r\npurest and noblest statesmen, Samuel J. Randall, his home is a center\r\nof charming, courtly and gracious hospitality dispensed with lavish,\r\nrefined and unaffected generosity. Mr. Bacon is the only lawyer in\r\nOrange County who has ever both recognized and fulfilled his social\r\nduty to his brethren of the bar by throwing open his home to them in\r\nreceptions intended to bring the judges and the lawyers together in\r\nsocial relations. In olden days and in other counties this custom\r\nonce prevailed. Possibly it is because Orange County labors under the\r\nmisfortune of being a half-shire county--a calamity to any bar for\r\nthe reason, besides many others, that it effectually destroys the\r\npossibility of having a suitable court house--that a spirit of\r\ncomradeship among its lawyers has never grown up. It is noticeable\r\nthat in counties where the legal interests converge in one central\r\ncounty seat the brotherly spirit is more active. But, however that\r\nmay be, Mr. Bacon is entitled to the grateful acknowledgment of his\r\nefforts to suspend the asperities of professional conflict in the\r\nsolvent of social converse. In this, as in every other respect, his\r\nleadership of the bar is supreme.\r\n\r\nWalter C. Anthony preceded Mr. Bacon a few months in their student\r\nlife with Judge Gedney at Goshen. No one has painted so perfect and\r\nbeautiful a picture as he of those halcyon days in that country law\r\noffice. In his memorial tribute he said:\r\n\r\n\"But of all the delightful hours spent with Judge Gedney I recall,\r\nwith most pleasure, our afternoon talks at the office. As the day was\r\nwearing late and he began to make preparations to leave, he usually\r\nseemed to want to draw me into conversation. Frequently it took the\r\nform of an examination as to those branches of the law which I was\r\nthen reading upon. Occasionally he would draw me into the discussion\r\nof some legal question, in which he would maintain an opinion opposed\r\nto that which I expressed, and in which after combating me, with all\r\nhis ingenuity and acuteness and frequently discomfiting me, he would\r\nin the end explain the whole question and point out the errors of\r\neither side of the argument. At times some event of the day's work\r\nwould be used as a foundation for an explanation of the legal\r\nquestions involved. In whatever way the conversation was begun his\r\nevident purpose was that it should be profitable to me in connection\r\nwith the studies I was pursuing; and when that end had been\r\naccomplished our conversation would wander on 'at its own sweet\r\nwill,' touching on many and varied themes which all developed new\r\nbeauties and suggestiveness beneath the light of his varied learning\r\nand fertile fancy. Is it to be wondered at that I recall them with a\r\nchastened delight? Judge Gedney was then in the very prime of his\r\nremarkable powers. His mind was a storehouse of varied and\r\ninteresting knowledge, and his conversational and descriptive skill\r\nwere not only very great, but quite unique.\r\n\r\n\"I shall always regard it as one of the most fortunate circumstances\r\nof my life that 1 was brought into such intimate association with\r\nDavid F. Gedney. And as my life passes on into the 'sere and yellow\r\nleaf and I sit among the lengthening shadows of its afternoon looking\r\nback upon the friends and friendships of my youth, I shall very, very\r\noften recall Judge Gedney--the slender, erect figure; the strongly\r\nmarked face; the scant but expressive gesture; the wonderfully\r\nmelodious and well modulated voice; the words so deftly chosen from\r\na vocabulary surpassingly rich and full, that they always reminded me\r\nof the sentence in holy writ: 'words fitly spoken are like apples of\r\ngold in pictures of silver;' and above all I shall recall his kind\r\nand generous deeds, the fit exponents of a loving, loyal heart; and,\r\nthus recalling him, I shall often in the future exclaim--as I have\r\nalready in the past--in no empty phrase and with no exaggeration of\r\nspeech:\r\n\r\n          \"'Oh for the touch of a vanished hand\r\n           And the sound of a voice that is still!'\"\r\n\r\nThis extract is made not solely to embellish the portrait of Judge\r\nGedney, the man--though I indeed left it unfinished intending thus to\r\ninvoke Mr. Anthony's aid in completing it--but also to illustrate Mr.\r\nAnthony's own cast of mind, character and literary style. Mr. Anthony\r\nis by nature and inclination, a scholar and a recluse. If he were\r\nrich he would shut up his office and browse in his library; but not\r\nselfishly, for no one has been more generous than he in responding to\r\ndemands for public and literary addresses. I heard him once, before\r\nthe Chautauqua Assembly, give a purely extemporaneous lecture upon\r\nwit and humor which for range of reading, wealth of information,\r\ncritical analysis and brilliant characterization has never been\r\nsurpassed by our most famous lecturers; and yet it was delivered with\r\na modesty, sweetness and simplicity which seemed to deprecate the\r\nsuggestion that it was anything out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nHis memory of Judge Gedney unconsciously reveals how deep was the\r\nimpression made in youth upon a mind singularly susceptible to the\r\ncharms and graces of literature and upon a nature no less susceptible\r\nto the beauties and joys of friendship. As in the case of all such\r\nnatures, the books must be choice and the friends fit but few. Not,\r\nindeed, that Mr. Anthony is deficient in the elements of personal\r\npopularity. His election twice to the office of district attorney of\r\nthe county, the duties of which he most ably discharged, attests his\r\npopular strength. But it is undeniable that his predilection for the\r\nsociety of the great and wise of every age, to be found in his\r\nwell-filled library, has tended more and more to withdraw him from\r\nthe society of the shallow, the superficial, the frivolous. He stands\r\nto-day a lonely but alluring figure, on whose heights those who\r\nchoose to follow may find in him the charming companion, the\r\naccomplished scholar, the earnest inquirer, the inspiring instructor.\r\n\r\nLet no captious reader take cynical exception to the note of honest\r\npraise sounded in these memoirs. Let it be remembered that, out of\r\nhundreds of lawyers, only a few of those entitled to admiration and\r\npraise have been selected for extended mention. While personal\r\nmemoirs should be accurate they need not be exhaustive. In those rare\r\ninstances in which conspicuous talent has yielded to temptation and,\r\nin weakness or dishonor, forfeited public respect, it has seemed to\r\nbe the truest kindness to pass over it in silence. Indeed, as one\r\nsurveys the procession down half a century of those who have become\r\nnotable in the law he is profoundly impressed that not by infirm,\r\ninvertebrate character have they gained their prominence but only by\r\nfirm resolution, high endeavor, moral purpose and intellectual power.\r\nOne is led to wonder not that there should be so few entitled to\r\npraise, but that there should be so many. Impartial criticism will\r\ndemand of the contemporary chronicler not that his praise be stinted,\r\nbut only that it be discriminating.\r\n\r\nIndeed only the most un-stinted, unqualified praise would be either\r\njust or appropriate in summoning from that stately procession of\r\ngreat and honored lawyers the lofty, imposing figure of Judge John J.\r\nBeattie, who for eighteen years--1889 to 1907--presided over the\r\nCounty Court of Orange County, having been elected for three\r\nsuccessive terms. His dignity of presence, weight of character and\r\nwealth of learning amply sustained the traditions of a bench once\r\noccupied by Gedney and Fullerton. Many of Judge Beattie's decisions\r\nhave been in cases of far-reaching public importance--notably the\r\ncase involving the construction of the eight-hour law in which Judge\r\nBeattie decided that the provision prohibiting a contractor from\r\nallowing his men to work over eight hours a day on a public\r\nimprovement was unconstitutional and void. The Appellate Division\r\nreversed but the Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Beattie in an\r\nopinion sustaining every position which Judge Beattie had taken in\r\nhis opinion.\r\n\r\nJudge Beattie is grounded in the principles of the law. In all that\r\nhe does he is thorough, going to the very bottom of the case whether\r\nas to the law or the facts. This quality was strikingly brought out\r\nin the case tried by him for eight days before Judge Maddox involving\r\nthe liability of a railroad company for the damage resulting from the\r\nexplosion of a locomotive boiler. There was absolutely nothing about\r\na boiler that Judge Beattie did not understand. One would have\r\nsupposed that he had been brought up in boiler works and had then run\r\nan engine on the road. He succeeded in dividing the jury and Judge\r\nMaddox said after the trial that he had never seen a finer display of\r\nsheer intellectuality than Judge Beattie's management of the defense.\r\n\r\nHe is an omnivorous reader and his marvelous memory retains all that\r\nhe ever read. His conversation is an intellectual feast, for he pours\r\nout a never-failing stream of literary anecdote, historic incident\r\nand choice passages from the classics of every age, all ready to gush\r\nforth from his well-stored memory as the conversation glances from\r\none subject to another.\r\n\r\nJudge Beattie carries into his retirement from the County Court the\r\ngratitude and respect of the bar and of the public for the fine\r\nexample of judicial dignity and learning which he has given for\r\neighteen years--an example which may well be followed not only by all\r\nwho succeed him in the County Court, but by all who administer in the\r\nsame court houses and from the same bench the wider jurisdiction of\r\nthe Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nHaving considered several leaders of the bar who came into practice\r\nin the late sixties, but who, like their predecessors, Winfield,\r\nGedney and Fullerton, were never invited to the bench of the Supreme\r\nCourt, we come now naturally to that group of their early associates\r\nwho have achieved judicial honors, those honors which have always\r\nheld a glittering fascination for the bar whether in the wearing or\r\nthe recounting of them. There never have been enough judgeships to go\r\naround and the long tenure now established wholly excludes rotation\r\namong the leaders of the bar in respect to judicial position. Hence\r\nthe prospect that any member of the bar, however able, will ever\r\nattain judicial honors is so remote and dependent upon so many\r\nunforeseen conditions that when they do descend and repose upon the\r\nmodest brow of some highly favored but always unenvied brother, the\r\ncircumstances combining to produce such a fortuitous selection\r\npossess all the charm of romance and all the fascination of a fairy\r\ntale. While it is true that many unforeseen conditions must always\r\nunite in determining the destination of this coveted prize, there\r\nstill seems to be one inexorable condition to which all Orange County\r\naspirants must conform. They must not reside in the interior of the\r\ncounty. They must practice in the old, historic city of Newburgh--a\r\ncity which has always taken a deep, honorable, patriotic pride in its\r\nRevolutionary associations and in the land they represent, but which\r\nhas no more pride in, no more sense of connection with, Orange County\r\nas a whole than West Point has. Its bar has always been distinguished\r\nfor great ability and high character.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the State of New York, the wide jurisdiction of\r\nwhich extends from Long Island to the St. Lawrence and the Lakes, was\r\nnever more fortunate than in the acquisition to its bench from the\r\nNewburgh bar of the two Browns, father and son--John W. Brown and\r\nCharles F. Brown--the elder having ascended the bench in 1850 and the\r\nyounger in 1883.\r\n\r\nIt is Charles F. Brown who belongs to the period we are now\r\nconsidering. Graduated from Yale College in 1866, admitted to\r\npractice in 1868, elected district attorney in 1874 and county judge\r\nin 1877, he resigned in 1882 the position of county judge to assume\r\nthe duties of supreme court judge.\r\n\r\nMr. Winfield had always ardently desired a position upon the bench of\r\nthe Supreme Court. It was one of the bitterest disappointments of his\r\nlife that he so narrowly missed this object of his ambition in 1875,\r\nwhen Judge Dykman was elected. In that year the widespread revolt\r\namong the bar and public against the re-election of that most\r\nunpopular official, Judge Tappen, who had received the regular\r\ndemocratic nomination, made it evident that any independent\r\ndemocratic candidate who should receive the endorsement of the\r\nrepublican convention would be elected. Mr. Winfield's hopes of\r\nreceiving this endorsement rose high and were on the point of being\r\nrealized when an unexpected influence intervened to dash them.\r\nGeneral Benjamin F. Tracy, who had a longstanding personal feud with\r\nWilliam Fullerton, the brother of Stephen W. Fullerton, suddenly came\r\nto the conclusion that he did not want upon the bench an intimate\r\nfriend of the Fullertons. He therefore threw his influence in favor\r\nof Jackson O. Dykman, then a prominent democratic lawyer of\r\nWestchester County, who thus received the nomination. His election by\r\na large democratic and republican vote confirmed the prediction that\r\nsuch a coalition would easily accomplish the defeat of Judge Tappen.\r\nOrange County, notwithstanding that it shared Mr. Winfield's\r\ndisappointment, followed his generous lead in supporting Judge\r\nDykman and gave him a majority of 10,000. No one labored for Mr.\r\nWinfield's nomination at this time more earnestly than Charles F.\r\nBrown himself.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Mr. Winfield's hopes of obtaining a nomination revived, but\r\nCharles F. Brown, who cherished the natural and honorable ambition to\r\nemulate his father's noble example and distinguished career as a\r\njurist, felt that he ought not to stand aside again. He of course\r\nsecured the delegate from his own assembly district without\r\nopposition. Overcoming the opposition offered by Mr. Winfield's\r\nfriends in the second assembly district, he secured its delegate\r\nalso. By thus presenting a united front Orange County was able to\r\nsuccessfully assert its claims in the judicial convention and to\r\nsecure for Judge Brown the nomination that was followed by his\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nNo one was more gratified by Judge Brown's election than Mr. Winfield\r\nhimself, especially as it involved the defeat of General Tracy, the\r\nvery man who, seven years before, had snatched from him the same\r\nprize when almost within his grasp. When General Tracy, of Kings\r\nCounty, was nominated by the republican convention against Judge\r\nBrown, of Orange County, he confidently expected to defeat Judge\r\nBrown, whose greatness was then unknown to the district at large,\r\nthrough the promised support of many large Brooklyn interests. But\r\nall his calculations were confounded by a wholly unexpected event.\r\nThis was the cataclysm in which Grover Cleveland, with whom Judge\r\nBrown was running, carried the State by the enormous, unprecedented\r\nmajority of 200,000.\r\n\r\nThus was Orange County enabled to contribute to the bench of the\r\nSupreme Court a jurist who, in the fourteen years of his incumbency,\r\nmade a profound, a lasting impression upon the jurisprudence not only\r\nof his State but of his country.\r\n\r\nAfter serving for six years with great acceptance in the trial and\r\nspecial terms, he was, upon the formation of the second division of\r\nthe Court of Appeals, promoted to its bench. His services during the\r\nfour years' existence of that court were of the highest value, his\r\nluminous opinions being still quoted and followed in every State in\r\nthe Union. Some of the litigations which came before him were in the\r\nhighest degree difficult and complicated; one of the most important\r\nbeing the case involving the construction of the Tilden will, in\r\nwhich the opinion of Judge Brown, declaring the trusts invalid, was\r\nadopted by the court. His opinions rendered in this court constitute\r\nan imperishable monument to his learning and ability.\r\n\r\nJudge Brown's manner upon the bench, at trial and special term, was a\r\nhappy mingling of simplicity and dignity. His most noticeable\r\npersonal trait was his entire lack of self-consciousness. He never\r\nthought about himself or about the impression which he might be\r\nmaking upon the bar or the public. His mind was wholly upon the case\r\nand upon the principles involved in it. He was considerate of the\r\nfeelings of counsel and rarely rebuked them for imperfect\r\npresentation of their views. When they wandered from the point he\r\nthought about the case and when they came back to the case he\r\nfollowed them again. It is simply the truth of history to say that\r\nthe members of the bar, not only of Orange County but of the entire\r\nState, do not expect to see in this generation a nearer approach to\r\nthe ideal judge than they were permitted to behold during the\r\nfourteen years of Judge Brown's incumbency.\r\n\r\nThere was one marked characteristic of Judge Brown while upon the\r\nbench which deserves more than a passing mention. After a case was\r\nsubmitted to him and while it was still under consideration he was\r\nnever afraid to enter upon a discussion of the principles involved\r\nin it, with either of the counsel he might happen to meet, if he felt\r\nthat such a discussion might prove profitable. In this respect he\r\ndiffered from some of his colleagues who were perfectly aghast at the\r\nthought of counsel conversing with them upon any phase of a pending\r\ncase in the absence of opposing counsel. This of course was due to\r\ntheir high sense of the importance of preserving not only real\r\nimpartiality but the strictest appearance of impartiality. But there\r\nwas something in Judge Brown's character which did not need the\r\nprotection of such a rule; something in the very atmosphere which he\r\nthrew out; something in the impression which he gave of being simply\r\na thinking, working, impersonal, intellectual machine, which left no\r\nroom for misunderstanding on the part of any lawyer thus admitted to\r\na share in his deliberations and which left his judicial independence\r\nand impartiality absolutely untouched. This capacity at once\r\nconstitutes the highest test and the consummate type of the strictly\r\njudicial temperament. To this test Judge Brown easily responded and\r\nof this type he was the perfect embodiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O. P. Howell]\r\n\r\nNo one can be accused of sycophancy in awarding to a judge long since\r\nretired from the bench his merited meed of praise and gratitude for\r\ndistinguished public services. Nor even in the case of judges still\r\noccupying the bench can such a charge fairly lie when the faithful\r\nhistorian surveying and reviewing, from the serene heights of\r\nretirement and rejection, the stirring scenes in which once he bore\r\nan active part, is now as indifferent to, as independent of, the\r\nopinions of judges as they are of his. It would indeed be far more\r\nentertaining if there could be contributed to this volume the\r\nopinions which the judges hold of each other, thrown into literary\r\nform instead of merely being promulgated from the bench or\r\ndisseminated by the press. When, upon the occasion of Queen\r\nVictoria's jubilee, the judges met in London to prepare an address to\r\nHer Majesty, the proposed draught submitted to them began with the\r\nwords, \"Conscious as we are of our shortcomings,\" whereupon Lord\r\nBowen gravely suggested, as an amendment, \"Conscious as we are of\r\n_each other's_ shortcomings.\" Human nature is very much the same\r\nhere and in England; very much the same, in its manifestations, among\r\njudges and among lawyers.\r\n\r\nJudge William D. Dickey ascended the bench in 1896, one year before\r\nJudge Brown's retirement from it. The second judicial district, of\r\nwhich Orange County then formed a part, was for many years democratic\r\nand it was not unusual for the republican conventions to endorse the\r\ndemocratic nominations. But in 1895 there seemed to be such a fair\r\nprospect for success that the republicans put forward a full ticket\r\nof judicial nominees, including Judge Dickey, who was elected, though\r\none of his associates upon the ticket, Hugo Hirsch, of Brooklyn, was\r\ndefeated by Judge Martin J. Keogh, whose court ought to be attended\r\nevery year by visiting delegations of judges from all parts of the\r\nState as a training school and object lesson, illustrating how a busy\r\njudge may at all times, in all circumstances and under all\r\nprovocations still be the model, faultless, consummate gentleman.\r\n\r\nAlthough Judge Dickey removed from Newburgh to Brooklyn soon after\r\nhis election and is counted as a judge of the second judicial\r\ndistrict, while Orange County is now a part of the ninth judicial\r\ndistrict, still Orange County is where he was born; where his\r\nprofessional life was passed; where he rose to prominence and power,\r\nand where he lived when he was elevated to the bench. He exhibited\r\neven in boyhood the qualities which have marked his public career,\r\nhis patriotic ardor inspiring him to enlist in the Union Army when\r\nonly seventeen years of age; his promotion being so rapid that before\r\nhe was twenty years old he had been brevetted colonel in recognition\r\nof conspicuous gallantry.\r\n\r\nAdmitted to practice soon after the close of the Civil War he threw\r\nhimself with characteristic energy not merely into the legal contests\r\nwhich arose in his city, but into all the public and political\r\ncontroversies of the day. Ardent in his affections and implacable\r\nin his hatreds, loyal to his friends and relentless to his enemies,\r\nhe soon acquired an extensive influence and attracted to himself a\r\ndevoted following, both personal and political.\r\n\r\nThe public spirit and civic pride shown by Judge Dickey in promoting\r\nevery enterprise tending to beautify or benefit his native city was\r\ngenerally recognized and his election to the constitutional\r\nconvention of 1893 was a distinct turning point in his career. His\r\nability, vigilance, authority, force of character and readiness in\r\ndebate, soon gave him a dominant influence in the deliberations of\r\nthat highly intellectual body--an influence aided by his commanding\r\npresence and resonant voice, advantages not without value in that\r\nmost difficult of all auditoriums, the assembly chamber in the\r\nCapitol at Albany. Among the many far-reaching reforms which he\r\nproposed or advocated in the convention he undoubtedly looks back\r\nwith special satisfaction upon the provision incorporated, with his\r\nactive support, in the new constitution prohibiting any legislative\r\nlimitation upon the amount of recovery for death occasioned by\r\nnegligence, since he has had abundant occasion in his experience upon\r\nthe bench to verify his convictions of the justice, necessity and\r\npublic policy of this amendment.\r\n\r\nJudge Dickey displays upon the bench the same sterling qualities\r\nwhich marked his active professional career. Among them none is more\r\npronounced than his remembrance of and kindness to old and valued\r\nfriends. The exercise by a judge of the patronage necessarily\r\npertaining to his office has always been a trying question for him.\r\nBut since one lawyer has no natural, superior claim over any other\r\nlawyer upon the fruits of patronage, there seems to be no reason why\r\na judge should not be permitted to gratify his feelings of friendship\r\nand esteem in the appointment of referees whom he knows to be not\r\nonly estimable but entirely capable. No one questioned this\r\nsentiment or principle of conduct when Judge Brown appointed his old\r\nfriend and partner, Mr. Cassedy referee to sell the West Shore\r\nrailroad, or when he appointed his old friend, William Harvey Clark,\r\nof Minisink, receiver of the Port Jervis and Monticello railroad;\r\nMr. Clark, by the way, proving to be so capable a receiver that he\r\nnot only paid its debts but surprised the stockholders by handing\r\nover to them a large amount of money.\r\n\r\nBut in the distribution of patronage Judge Dickey has not only been\r\nloyal to the claims of private friendship; he has nobly used it in\r\nthe recognition of the debt which the public owes to distinguished\r\npublic services and sacrifices. I know one able lawyer whose physical\r\ninfirmities disqualify him from active practice at the bar, but whose\r\neye is still as clear, whose judgment as alert as when, from the\r\nheights of Gettysburg, he directed the Federal forces on the first\r\nday of the battle and saved the fortunes of the day till they could\r\nbe turned and redeemed upon the morrow. In appointing this old hero\r\nto important service in various public condemnation proceedings, in\r\nwhich his sound judgment and wide experience have been utilized to\r\nthe public benefit. Judge Dickey has entitled himself to the\r\ngratitude of all who believe that conspicuous worth and patriotic\r\nservice should not be forgotten and neglected by judges any more than\r\nby governors or presidents. And personal gratitude is no less due to\r\nJudge Dickey from all those whose appointment by him to positions of\r\ntrust and responsibility has enabled them to justify his own unerring\r\njudgment as to their fitness and capacity.\r\n\r\nIt was in the autumn of 1902 that Judge Dickey was called upon to\r\npass through the first deep sorrow of his life in the loss of his\r\nonly son, Frank R. Dickey, cut off in his young manhood at the very\r\nbeginning of his promising career at the bar. Born and educated in\r\nNewburgh he had followed his father to Brooklyn, where he established\r\nhimself in practice and where he soon won a large and growing\r\nclientage. His solid abilities; his pure, lofty character; his open,\r\nsincere nature; his refined, engaging manners; his gentle, amiable\r\ndisposition united to create a personality of singular charm and\r\ninterest. Troops of new friends, attracted to him by the graces of a\r\nsweet and beautiful character, joined with those who had always known\r\nand loved him in heartfelt sorrow over the untimely grave of Frank R.\r\nDickey.\r\n\r\nJudge Dickey's wide experience in affairs, with his knowledge of\r\nhuman nature, its secret springs and devious ways, enables him to\r\narrive at decisions always prompt and usually just. His influence\r\nupon the bench has always been powerfully exerted in support of the\r\ndomestic virtues and social purity. Gambling, which is fast becoming\r\none of the most threatening of our national dangers, as it is already\r\none of the most degrading and corrupting of our social vices, whether\r\npracticed by men in policy shops, or by women at bridge parties,\r\nfinds in him, whenever it comes within his judicial purview, neither\r\ncountenance nor toleration.\r\n\r\nThere is one trait of Judge Dickey upon the bench which calls for\r\nspecial mention. When, in an action which has been tried and decided\r\nby him, without a jury, the attorneys come before him for settlement\r\nof the case upon appeal, he does not seek to emasculate the appeal,\r\nas some judges in their weakness and vanity do, by striking out the\r\nexceptions designed to bring up sharply for review the points of\r\ndifference between him and the defeated counsel. He always gives the\r\nunsuccessful and dissatisfied litigant a fair opportunity to review\r\nevery issuable ruling and to get a reversal if he can. He is not\r\nhyper-sensitive upon the subject of being sustained by the appellate\r\ncourts. Indeed, his mental attitude toward them is doubtless\r\nreflected in the remark once made by the famous judge, Lord Young,\r\nwhen he was told that one of his decisions had been affirmed upon\r\nappeal by the House of Lords, \"Well, I may have been right,\r\nnotwithstanding,\" said Lord Young.\r\n\r\nAs Judge Dickey has never been assigned to the Appellate Division and\r\nmuch prefers the close contact with the bar and with vital human\r\ninterests which is enjoyed by judges constantly engaged in trial\r\nterm and special term, he has never felt called upon to accompany his\r\ndecisions with opinions of any length. When he does write, his\r\nopinions are clear, terse and sententious. Indeed there is very\r\nlittle satisfaction for a judge at special term in writing elaborate\r\nopinions, only to find them arrested and archived in that mere\r\nvestibule of fame, that hall of unmerited but predestined and\r\npathetic oblivion known as the Miscellaneous Reports.\r\n\r\nBut the waters of a cruel, though often kindly, oblivion can never\r\nwholly submerge the fine superstructure of judicial fame reared by\r\nJudge Michael H. Hirschberg upon a foundation of singularly\r\nexclusive, concentrated, severe, professional, intellectual and\r\nliterary training. Born and reared in Newburgh, but coming to\r\npractice at the bar without those intermediate college advantages\r\nenjoyed by his life-long friend and associate, Judge Brown, whom he\r\nsucceeded upon the bench, he has, nevertheless, strikingly verified\r\nthe saying of Carlyle that, after all, books are the best university.\r\nDuring all the years of his professional activity in Orange County\r\nhe sedulously, patiently wrought out, cultivated and perfected a\r\ncrisp, nervous, virile, epigrammatic, yet withal, polished,\r\nmellifluous, ornate and opulent English style which constituted an\r\nadmirable discipline and equipment for the very field of juristic\r\nservice in which he was later destined to engage.\r\n\r\nElected in 1890 to a seat upon the bench, he was, after a brief\r\nperiod of service at trial and special terms, assigned to the\r\nAppellate Division, and later, upon the retirement of Judge Goodrich,\r\nhe was appointed the presiding justice of the court. This was the\r\nopportunity for which his slumbering, but not unready, accomplishments\r\nlong had waited. Then ensued the disclosure to his judicial\r\nassociates and to the bar of the State of those attainments as a\r\nwriter and as a jurist, which had long been known to the bench and\r\nbar of his county and his district. While comparisons are often more\r\ndangerous than odious his career almost inevitably reminds one of\r\nthat literary lawyer, known then chiefly for his writing of \"The Blue\r\nand the Grey,\" who was summoned by his friend, Governor Cornell, from\r\nhis scholarly seclusion at Ithaca to take a seat upon the bench of\r\nthe Court of Appeals; and who thereupon enriched the literature of\r\nthe law with a body of opinions, unrivaled for English style and\r\njudicial learning, which have entranced and instructed two\r\ngenerations of lawyers. Equally true is it of Judge Hirschberg that\r\nalready has he permanently enriched the Reports of the Appellate\r\nDivision with a series of opinions which, for lucidity of statement,\r\nforce of reasoning, felicity of style, and perfect command of the\r\nliterary implements adapted to the expression of exact distinctions\r\nor delicate discriminations, stand unrivaled in the pages of these\r\nimposing volumes, which will long perpetuate his fame as a judicial\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nOne characteristic of Judge Hirschberg during his brief service in\r\nholding trial terms should be mentioned, because no ponderous tomes\r\ncan reveal character. Contemporary history must transfix for\r\nposterity the personal traits and manners of a judge. When Judge\r\nHirschberg was elected even his intimate friends supposed, from long\r\nfamiliarity with his extraordinary quickness of mental action, his\r\nscintillations of repartee in social life and his swift rejoinder at\r\nthe bar, that he would show some impatience with the slowness,\r\ndullness and density due to imperfect preparation or inherent\r\nineptitude, which every judge is called upon, more or less\r\nfrequently, to endure; that he would find it difficult to restrain\r\nthe bubbling of wit and sarcasm at the expense of ignorance or\r\nincapacity. But on the contrary, he proved to be the most gentle,\r\nindulgent and long-suffering of judges. The wearisome lawyers might\r\ndrone on, he made no effort to take the trial of the case out of\r\ntheir hands and try it himself, he could try it better than they, but\r\nhe felt it his duty to let them try it in their own way. No one could\r\ntell what he was thinking of them or their methods. He might be a\r\nmaelstrom of seething disgust or amusement within; but he wore the\r\nimpassive, inscrutable, uncommunicative exterior of a sphinx. Under\r\nthe responsibility of his great office he unconsciously developed and\r\nen-grafted that quality which Judge Jenks in his impressive eulogy\r\nupon Judge Wilmot M. Smith declared to be almost the greatest\r\nattribute of a judge--infinite patience.\r\n\r\nAnd since the entire bar of Orange County regarded with peculiar\r\naffection the character of Judge Smith and now holds in deepest\r\nveneration his sacred memory, it is not amiss to incorporate in this\r\nrecord that expression of its feelings by Judge Hirschberg himself,\r\nwhich sheds a reflected light upon his own standards of duty and with\r\nwhich this attempt to limn his portrait for succeeding generations\r\nmay fitly close:\r\n\r\n\"Judge Smith was truly an ideal jurist, profound as a lawyer,\r\nestimable as a citizen, lovable as a man. The mortal part of each\r\nlife ends necessarily in nothing but an insignificant contribution to\r\nan immense volume of pathetic dust, but the spiritual sense is\r\nsatisfied when, as in this instance, the ashes are sanctified with\r\nthe memory of a noble life devoted to duty and glorified with the\r\nlove of God, of justice and of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, having sought to project upon the canvas a faithful\r\nportraiture of the judges who were drawn into the public service from\r\nthe Orange County bar, within the period embraced in these personal\r\nrecollections, it is convenient and fitting at this time to briefly\r\noutline the conditions of practice which prevailed in Orange County\r\nat the time they came to the bar--Judge Dickey in 1866 and Judges\r\nBrown and Hirschberg in 1868--when Winfield, Gedney and Fullerton\r\nwere at the zenith of their powers and their reputation. It is a\r\ngreat mistake to assume that the older members of the bar were\r\nsatisfied with these conditions. On the contrary, they bitterly\r\nchafed under them. The number of judges was wholly inadequate to the\r\nneeds of the district, as will readily be seen when it is considered\r\nthat twenty-five judges are now required to serve the same territory\r\nthen covered by only four judges upon whom devolved all the motions,\r\ntrials and appeals arising and heard within it. The ever-increasing\r\nvolume of business created by the rapid growth of Brooklyn made it\r\nimpossible for the judges to hold a trial term--then called the\r\n\"circuit term\"--longer than five days. The judges were indeed upon a\r\ncircuit, for they were always under assignment to open court in some\r\nother county on the following Monday. Every Thursday afternoon or\r\nFriday morning the judge marked off the calendar every case which\r\ncould not be tried in time to enable him to leave on Friday afternoon\r\nin order to hold his Saturday special term. This arbitrary,\r\ninexorable limitation of time, which was equivalent to shutting out\r\nmany cases that had been carefully prepared, was most cruel to the\r\nyounger members of the bar whose sole chance of either emolument or\r\ndistinction lay in getting their cases tried; while to say that these\r\nconditions were satisfactory to the older members of the bar of that\r\nperiod would violate the truth of history. They always unduly and\r\noften indecently accelerated the trial of important cases in which\r\nadvocates like Winfield and Gedney were spurred to an undignified\r\ncelerity which was not merely distasteful but detestable to them.\r\nBoth Winfield and Gedney were tenacious of dignity, deliberation and\r\ndecorum in the administration of justice. They disliked extremely to\r\nbe told. \"Go on with the case, gentlemen,\" or to be asked, \"What are\r\nyou waiting for?\" They could not share the glee manifested by the\r\njudge when he succeeded in having three juries \"out\" at one time, and\r\nboasted to the justices of Sessions at his side how he was\r\n\"expediting the business.\" They, too, wanted the business advanced,\r\nbut they wanted it done with due regard to the traditions and the\r\nusages of the bar. Winfield was especially the distinct\r\nrepresentative in this county of the old Websterian school of\r\nadvocates. He believed earnestly in the maintenance of all that form\r\nand dignity, of all those ancient usages and proprieties which once\r\nuniformly marked the relations to each other of the bench and bar.\r\nWhen in 1874 I met him in Albany to argue my first case in the Court\r\nof Appeals, then presided over by that most urbane jurist, Judge\r\nSanford E. Church, Mr. Winfield carefully attired himself on the\r\nmorning of the argument in a full-dress black suit with its broad\r\nexpanse of shirt front, now used only for evening wear, but regarded\r\nat that time as a suitable uniform for appearance before the highest\r\ncourt in the State; just as, at a slightly earlier period, Webster\r\nand Pinckney appeared before the Supreme Court at Washington in blue\r\ncoat and brass buttons, with buff waistcoat. How different from the\r\npresent when able lawyers in short sack coats of gray, looking like\r\ncommercial travelers, hasten from the Albany station to the two\r\no'clock sessions of the court without stopping to even remove the\r\ndust of travel before launching into their keen and brilliant\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nWhen Judge Joseph F. Barnard, of Poughkeepsie, upon the transfer of\r\njudge Lott to the Court of Appeals in 1869, became the presiding\r\njudge of the old general term, he became also the presiding genius,\r\nthe dominating, all-pervading spirit of the second judicial district.\r\nHe was opposed to any increase in the number of judges. With his\r\ninsatiable voracity for work and his preternatural velocity of\r\nthought, enabling him to accomplish as much alone as the other three\r\njudges combined, he thought that four judges ought to be fully able\r\nto keep up with all the business of the district; as indeed they were\r\nif the administration of justice, involving the most profound issues\r\nof human life and society, had been merely a matter of getting the\r\nbusiness out of the way, as on a wharf, to make room for the next\r\ncargo.\r\n\r\nThe judges, fresh from their several circuit terms, met in the\r\ngeneral term and proceeded to hear appeals from the decisions made by\r\nthemselves at special and trial term. It was, indeed, an impressive,\r\ninspiring and solemn spectacle to see Judge Tappen and Judge Gilbert\r\ngravely considering whether they would reverse Judge Barnard; and in\r\nthe next case Judge Tappen and Judge Barnard sitting upon Judge\r\nGilbert. Of course the tacit challenge, \"You reverse me, I'll\r\nreverse you,\" pervaded all the proceedings. Nothing else could be\r\nexpected of human nature. It has never been pretended that the State\r\nsupplies lawyers with any superior, exclusive brand of human nature\r\nwhen it gives them their diploma, and judges are simply lawyers upon\r\nthe bench. That an appellate system should ever have been devised so\r\nexquisitely adapted to defeat its object and destroy respect for its\r\noperations was not, of course, the fault of the judges of the second\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nWhen the general term sat in Poughkeepsie, as it did every May, to\r\naccommodate Judge Barnard, the business was disposed of even more\r\nrapidly than in Brooklyn, Judge Barnard greeting with delight any\r\nlawyers who would appear at eight o'clock in the morning, both ready\r\nto argue their appeal in advance of the regular session. The judges\r\nconstantly interrupted the attorneys to assure them that they could\r\nnot possibly remember what they said but that they would read their\r\nbriefs. It was of course true that no human mind could retain or even\r\ngrasp the arguments discharged at the court as from a catapult by\r\nattorneys gasping for breath in the mad race against time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wm. O. Piorshalf]\r\n\r\nSome amelioration of the intolerable conditions under which circuit\r\nterms were held in Newburgh and Goshen was effected through the\r\nelection in 1870 of Judge Calvin E. Pratt, whose conservatism,\r\naffability and dignity won for him universal respect. This\r\nimprovement was extended by the election in 1880 of Judge Edgar M.\r\nCullen, whose high sense of absolute fairness to all suitors alike\r\nled him to devote as much time and thought to a case involving a\r\ntrifling amount as to one involving large interests; though even he\r\nwas merciless in his infliction of night sessions upon the attorneys\r\nduring the hot June term at Goshen, a course to which he felt\r\nimpelled because of his inability to remain longer than one week and\r\nhis desire to crowd as much work as possible into that wholly\r\ninadequate time.\r\n\r\nThe comfort and convenience of the Orange County bar and the\r\ninterests of litigants were served to a still greater degree by the\r\nelection in 1882 of Judge Charles F. Brown. Though he could not\r\nextend the trial terms beyond two weeks, on account of his\r\nassignments to other counties, still he held a special term every\r\nSaturday at Newburgh where, by consent of counsel, many cases were\r\ntried that otherwise would have been tried before a jury, thus\r\naffording great relief to the overtaxed calendars of the trial terms.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to the present there has been a steady reaction\r\nagainst feverishness and ferment as a suitable atmosphere for\r\njudicial proceedings and a gradual return to calm, neutral,\r\ndeliberate, dignified, decorous methods of judicial procedure, until\r\nfinally, for the first time in the history of the county, a\r\nfour-weeks' term of court was held in February, 1907; this being one\r\nof the first fruits of the formation of the ninth judicial district,\r\nconsisting of the river counties alone--a change which was opposed by\r\nsome Orange County lawyers but which is now generally recognized as,\r\nin the highest degree, conducive to the convenience and interests\r\nof the bar and of the public, though it does involve some additional\r\nburdens upon jurors.\r\n\r\nForty years ago the familiar excuse made by judges for dispatching\r\nbusiness with unseemly haste was their solicitude for the time and\r\nconvenience of the jurors. Indeed there never was a judge more\r\npopular than Judge Barnard among jurors, witnesses, spectators and\r\nthe public. They admired the celerity of his movements and they were\r\nvastly entertained by his caustic remarks to counsel. But his remarks\r\nabout counsel and witnesses during the progress of the trial were far\r\nmore entertaining and racy than any the public was permitted to hear.\r\nThe favored persons privileged to hear these were his associates upon\r\nthe bench of the old Oyer and Terminer, since abolished and now\r\nmerged in the Supreme Court. They were drawn from the justices of the\r\npeace of the county and with the presiding judge constituted the\r\ncriminal branch of the court. Squire George A. Durland, of the town\r\nof Greenville, who sat in this capacity next to Judge Barnard at many\r\nterms of court, never tired of telling about the trenchant, scathing,\r\nwitty commentary kept up by the judge upon every incident of the\r\ntrial, the counsel engaged in it and the witnesses sworn upon it.\r\n\r\nDuring Judge Barnard's entire tenure of office the plea of not taking\r\nup the time of the jurors was invoked to override every other\r\nconsideration. Not even death itself was superior to it or sacred\r\nfrom it. When Mr. Winfield died on the tenth of June, 1888, and court\r\nconvened at Goshen on Monday, the eighteenth of June, Judge Cullen\r\nsuspended the regular business of the court at four o'clock to allow\r\na suitable tribute to his memory, including several addresses in\r\naddition to the resolutions. But when Judge Gedney died, a month\r\nlater, there was no opportunity to take formal action upon his death\r\nat a trial term until the regular November term. Accordingly, when\r\ncourt convened at Newburgh the twelfth of November an informal\r\nrequest was made to Judge Barnard for an opportunity to pursue the\r\nsame course in respect to Judge Gedney's memory that had been adopted\r\nat Goshen in respect to Mr. Winfield. Judge Barnard promptly and\r\nfirmly refused to allow the time of the jurors to be taken up in this\r\nway, adding: \"Why, he's been dead some time, hasn't he?\" So it became\r\nnecessary to change the plan and to offer simply a motion \"that a\r\ncommittee be appointed to present at a meeting of the bar of Orange\r\nCounty to be hereafter called suitable resolutions.\" That there\r\nshould be further delay in honoring the memory of this great lawyer\r\nand brilliant advocate, after there had already been a necessary\r\ndelay of four months, is not a reproach that rests upon the bar of\r\nOrange County. As the motion occupied only two minutes it was\r\npromptly granted and the committee purposed to present the\r\nresolutions at the following term of court to be held at Goshen in\r\nJanuary, 1889, which was expected to be presided over by Judge Brown.\r\nBut when Judge Brown was transferred to the Court of Appeals he\r\nbecame disqualified from holding the term and Judge Barnard\r\nunexpectedly took his place. Admonished by previous experience no\r\nattempt was made to present the resolutions at that time or to apply\r\nfor permission to make addresses in honor of Judge John G. Wilkin,\r\nwho, also, had meantime died. So the tributes of the Orange County\r\nbar to Judge Gedney, Judge Wilkin and Surrogate Henry A. Wadsworth,\r\nwhose death also had occurred, were massed together at a meeting of\r\nthe bar presided over by Judge Brown on Saturday, the second day of\r\nFebruary, 1889, seven months after the death of Judge Gedney, without\r\nthose customary adjuncts to the dignity of the occasion--the crowded\r\ncourt room; the attendance of litigants, jurors and witnesses from\r\nall parts of the county; the solemn pause in the business of the\r\ncourt; the impressive silence; the strained, eager attention of old\r\nfriends in the audience to the last tributes of respect for one they\r\nloved; all of which were not only appropriate but, indeed, imperative\r\nin honoring one who had so often held that very court room silent,\r\ncaptive, enthralled by the spell of his genius.\r\n\r\nIf Judge Gedney's brethren had felt, in the first instance, that a\r\ntribute to his memory at a mere meeting of the bar would be\r\nappropriate and adequate, it would not have been delayed seven\r\nmonths, as such a meeting could have been called at any time after\r\nhis death. That it was not so called shows the strength of a\r\nsentiment which was ruthlessly trampled upon by judicial contempt not\r\nmerely for all the traditions of the bar but for all the sacredness\r\nof love and death.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the bar always recognized with gratitude the earnest\r\ndesire on the part of Judge Barnard to transact all the business that\r\nhe could and to accommodate the bar as much as possible. It was this\r\ndisposition that led to his constant signing of _ex parte_ orders\r\nwithout looking at them, trusting to the honor of the bar not to\r\nimpose upon him and, also, to a motion by the other side to vacate\r\nany improvident order. The lawyers, through long custom, so came to\r\nprefer this system that they resented any departure from it by new\r\njudges who could not take this view of their duties. When Judge\r\nBrown's transfer to the second division of the Court of Appeals led\r\nto the Newburgh special terms being taken by Judges Cullen and\r\nBartlett, the bar practically boycotted them in favor of Judge\r\nBarnard's Saturday term at Poughkeepsie, merely because both Judge\r\nCullen and Judge Bartlett manifested a very decided preference to\r\nknow what they were signing. Gradually, however, the lawyers learned\r\nthat this course was not intended as a reflection upon the bar, but as\r\na help to it, in preventing any such mistake or oversight as might\r\nlead afterwards to serious consequences. Of this I once witnessed a\r\nstriking illustration. An attorney desired an order to examine a\r\nparty before trial in a case in which the examination of his\r\nadversary was absolutely essential to his success in the litigation.\r\nJudge Bartlett sent the affidavit back to him three times for\r\ncorrection and the order was finally sustained in the Court of\r\nAppeals because of the sufficiency of the affidavit. All this\r\ninvolved to Judge Bartlett conscientious labor and minute examination\r\nwhich he might well have shirked and which judges generally consider\r\ncounsel have no right to expect of them or to impose upon them.\r\n\r\nJudge Barnard was the most conspicuous of all the judges in his\r\nanxiety to save the lawyers the trouble of travel in order to\r\ntransact their business. He instructed the Orange County attorneys to\r\nmail to him an order designating a referee of their own choice, to\r\ncompute the amount due in foreclosure cases, with the report of the\r\nreferee signed by him in anticipation of his appointment, together\r\nwith the judgment of foreclosure; whereupon he signed at the same\r\ntime both the order of reference and the judgment of foreclosure,\r\npromptly mailing them back, although it was physically impossible\r\nthat the referee should have acted in the interval between his\r\nappointment and the judgment. This practice, which is now regarded as\r\nirregular and which even the most accommodating judges now\r\ndiscountenance, resulted in no harm, for it rested upon the most\r\nimplicit good faith on the part of the attorneys, while the\r\nconfidence of the judge was never, in a single instance, abused. An\r\nincident strongly illustrating this trait of Judge Barnard also grew\r\nindirectly out of Judge Brown's transfer to the Court of Appeals.\r\nJudgments of foreclosure in cases in Sullivan County had usually been\r\ntaken before Judge Brown at Newburgh because, though in another\r\njudicial district, Orange County is an adjoining county and this is\r\npermitted by the code. But soon after judge Brown left Newburgh an\r\nattorney, overlooking the fact that Dutchess County does not adjoin\r\nSullivan, sent the papers in a Sullivan County foreclosure case to\r\nJudge Barnard to be signed by him on Saturday at Poughkeepsie. His\r\neagle eye at once noticed that the action was in Sullivan County and\r\nthat he had no jurisdiction to act in the case in Dutchess County.\r\nAny other judge would have returned the papers, calling attention to\r\nthe difficulty. But did this satisfy Judge Barnard? Not at all. This\r\nwould not have advanced the business. This would not have \"helped out\r\nthe boys.\" So he struck out the word \"Poughkeepsie\" in the order and\r\njudgment and in his own handwriting substituted the word \"Newburgh,\"\r\nthus making himself, by a legal fiction, sit in an adjoining county\r\nfor five minutes, for the purposes of that case, though he was\r\nactually in Poughkeepsie all that day, and though he never held a\r\nSaturday special term in Newburgh in all his life. Judge Cullen and\r\nJudge Bartlett would have felt that they were inviting impeachment by\r\nsuch an act, and yet Judge Barnard was moved solely by the desire to\r\nfacilitate the business of the attorneys in every possible way. To\r\nhim an irregularity meant nothing unless it meant also a wrong. But\r\nthose days have passed and have been succeeded by better days, in\r\nwhich it is recognized by the courts and the lawyers alike that they\r\nshould co-operate in making even their routine practice so regular as\r\nto exclude any possibility of error.\r\n\r\nThere will be no sigh in this retrospect over the better days of long\r\nago, no wail about the \"good old times.\" The better days are now and\r\nthe good times have come at last. The new generation of lawyers now\r\nentering upon their active career has reason for gratification that\r\nthe facilities for the orderly, deliberate, tranquil trial and\r\nhearing of their causes, with the prospect that even and exact\r\njustice will be rendered in them, are greater to-day than at any\r\nprevious period in the history of the county. There never was so good\r\nan opportunity for a young, ambitious, able advocate to win fame at\r\nthe bar of Orange County as there is to-day. While the subjects of\r\nlitigation and the conditions of business have somewhat changed in\r\nthe last fifty years, human nature has never changed. Juries respond\r\nto-day as readily as then to the touch of a master spirit. When\r\njurors ask nowadays why they do not hear such speeches at court as\r\ntheir fathers have told them about the answer generally given is that\r\njudges frown upon anything like display and hold the lawyers down to\r\nbusiness. The business of an advocate is to make a good speech and no\r\njudge ever was able to stop a good speech. Let no young lawyer seek\r\nindolent refuge in the pretext that the judges will not give him a\r\nchance. Let him not, with difficulty, fold his restless pinions lest\r\nthey be arrested in their soaring flight by judicial insensibility.\r\nNo, the reason that forensic eloquence has so lamentably declined in\r\nOrange County lies not in the hostility of judges, but in the\r\nabsorption of lawyers themselves in the merely material, sordid\r\naspects of life, to the exclusion of any interest in those liberal\r\narts and erudite pursuits which alone can anoint the hesitating lips\r\nwith the honey of eloquent discourse. The field is clear for another\r\nWinfield or Gedney.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion to say that the influence of the bar has\r\ndeclined--that the legal profession, as a body, does not enjoy the\r\nsame measure of public respect which was paid to it in the early days\r\nof the republic, or exercise now that ascendancy over public opinion\r\nwhich once it exerted so powerfully and so naturally. It is true,\r\nindeed, that coincidently with the stealthy, sinister growth in the\r\nNorthern States of the modern machine methods of party management the\r\nlawyer has been gradually and inevitably displaced as a leader of\r\npublic opinion. It is only in the South that the influence of the\r\nlawyer among the masses is still unshaken because there the appeal of\r\ncandidates is still made directly to the people who, through their\r\nprimaries and in other republican ways familiar to the fathers and\r\nfounders of the nation, express their preference and give effect to\r\ntheir choice.\r\n\r\nBut it is significant that, even in the North, whenever the people at\r\nlarge resolve to destroy long-standing abuses or odious machines, as,\r\nat stated intervals, they always proceed to do, they turn\r\ninstinctively, as of old, to the plain, simple, honest, busy,\r\npracticing lawyer. Among the lawyers elected to the high office of\r\ngovernor of our State the three governors whose homely, direct,\r\nstraightforward methods have most captivated the imagination and\r\nimpressed the conscience of the passing generation are Tilden,\r\nCleveland and Hughes, who simply brought to their duties the habits,\r\nthe instincts, the training and the ideals of the old-fashioned\r\ncountry lawyer, whose first aim is always to protect the interests\r\ncommitted to his charge without any thought as to the effect of his\r\ncourse upon his own interests, popularity or future. This training,\r\nthis tradition, this character of the true lawyer still happily\r\nsurvives all changes in political methods or party management and\r\nstill constitutes the highest security the people have for the\r\nfaithful administration of their laws, wholly un-swerved by selfish,\r\nulterior or sinister purposes.\r\n\r\nAt the time, now forty years ago, to which my memory of the Orange\r\nCounty bar runs back, these honorable traditions were wholly\r\nmaintained by a bar, the members of which still enjoyed a high place\r\nin the public esteem and exercised a profound influence upon public\r\nopinion, based upon the dignity and importance of their profession as\r\nwell as upon their personal talents and character. The relations\r\nbetween the lawyers and the farmers were particularly close,\r\nconfidential and agreeable. The soil was still largely occupied by\r\nmen of character, education and intelligence who freely sought the\r\ncounsel and society of their friends among the lawyers at whose\r\noffices and homes they were as cordially welcomed on a social or\r\npolitical call as upon a professional visit. The reason that the sons\r\nand successors of the lawyers of that day have, to some extent, lost\r\ntouch with the interests of the soil is that the farmers of that day\r\nwere not able to persuade their sons to become their successors. The\r\nsaddest change that has overtaken Orange County in the last forty\r\nyears is not in the character of its professional men, but in the\r\ncharacter of its farming population.\r\n\r\nIdentified with the period included in the personal recollections\r\nhere but partially preserved are several groups of fathers and sons\r\nwho may for convenience be considered together; especially as a\r\nsufficiently consecutive view of the period has now been presented to\r\nadmit, henceforth, of greater latitude in respect to time and order.\r\n\r\nJoseph W. Gott, senior, died in 1869 after twenty-seven years\r\ncontinuous practice in Goshen, where he established the enviable\r\nreputation throughout the county of being one of the most honorable\r\nand high-minded men, as well as one of the most able and successful\r\nlawyers, known to his generation. His premature and deeply regretted\r\ndeath occurred before his only son could be admitted to practice.\r\n\r\nJoseph W. Gott, Jr., was admitted in 1875 and since then, like his\r\nfather, has practiced continuously in Goshen. No higher praise can be\r\nbestowed upon him than to say, that while he has, by his own vigorous\r\nintellect and independent character, won for himself prominence at\r\nthe bar, he has never lost sight of the high ideals which animated\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nThe general confidence in his supreme honor and integrity which he\r\nhas always enjoyed corresponds most touchingly to the confidence and\r\nrespect always inspired by his honored father. With him is now\r\nassociated in practice his own son, Percy Van Duzer Gott. These two\r\nare mentioned first in the group of fathers and sons because they are\r\nthe only lawyers in Orange County, thus associated, who constitute\r\nand represent four generations of Orange County lawyers. For in them\r\nflows not only the blood of the elder Gott, but the blood of the Van\r\nDuzers and the Gedneys.\r\n\r\nIsaac R. Van Duzer, who married in 1826 the older sister of Judge\r\nGedney--their daughter, Charlotte, being married to Joseph W. Gott in\r\n1847--was, undoubtedly, the most brilliant advocate, with the single\r\nexception of Ogden Hoffman, who ever addressed an Orange County jury.\r\nAll the accounts of contemporaries and all the traditions of the bar\r\nunite in this verdict. Often have I heard Judge Wilkin, who as a boy\r\nheard him in Goshen, expatiate upon his transcendent powers. He died\r\nprematurely in his fortieth year, but the opinion entertained by his\r\ngeneration was that, had he lived, his name would have gone down to\r\nhistory with the foremost orators of his age. Of their distinguished\r\nancestry at the bar of Orange County the Gotts may well be proud; for\r\nthe junior member in the present firm is now the fourth in a line of\r\nlawyers whose practice and residence at Goshen have extended over a\r\nperiod of eighty-five years--from 1823 to the present time.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Brown was admitted to practice in 1822, just one year before\r\nMr. Van Duzer, to whom he was related, Judge Brown having married a\r\nReeve, which was the family name of Mr. Van Duzer's mother. It is\r\nremarkable that if the practice of Judge Brown and of his own son,\r\nCharles F. Brown, had not been interrupted by extended terms of\r\njudicial service in the life of each--sixteen years in the life of\r\nthe elder Brown and fourteen years in the life of the younger--the\r\ncontinuous practice of the two Browns would now cover a period of\r\neighty-six years. As it is, their contributions in two generations to\r\nthe jurisprudence of the State, at the bar and on the bench, cover a\r\nlonger period than that embraced in the careers of any father and son\r\nassociated with the legal annals of Orange County. I say still\r\nassociated because, although Judge Charles F. Brown is now one of the\r\ntwo or three acknowledged leaders of the bar of the State, with his\r\noffice in New York City, where his practice is largely in the\r\nAppellate Courts, he still retains his residence in Orange County and\r\na nominal connection with the firm established in Newburgh by his\r\nformer partner, Mr. Cassedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stph. Fullerton]\r\n\r\nHis own career has already been sufficiently treated in its\r\nappropriate place in this commentary. It only remains to add that his\r\nlife-long veneration for his father's memory and his consistent\r\nemulation of his father's example supply an element of interest to\r\nhis career and of filial tenderness to his character not appreciated\r\nby the thousands of his admirers, among the judges and lawyers of the\r\ncountry, who know him only through the cold medium of his published\r\njudicial opinions.\r\n\r\nJudge John W. Brown was undoubtedly a great man. Serving two terms in\r\nCongress from 1833 to 1837; a prominent member of the Constitutional\r\nConvention of 1846; elected in 1849 to the Supreme Court and again in\r\n1857, his life was one of unceasing activity, influence and power.\r\nHis greatness as a judge may be inferred from the remarkable\r\ncircumstance that no decision made by him was ever reversed by the\r\nCourt of Appeals, of which court he was himself a member, under the\r\nsystem then prevailing, during the last years of his successive terms\r\nas a judge of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that one who was born to the heritage of such a\r\nname should have sought to add, as indeed he has added, to its luster\r\nin a succeeding generation.\r\n\r\nIt was while Charles F. Brown was district attorney of Orange County\r\nthat John W. Lyon became an official of the county through his\r\nappointment to the office of assistant district attorney. The career\r\nof the Lyons, father and son, now covers a practice of sixty-one\r\nyears in Port Jervis, the longest period of continuous practice at\r\nthe bar carried over from father to son, in Orange County.\r\n\r\nThomas J. Lyon, or, as his friends affectionately preferred to call\r\nhim, Tom Lyon, was a man of great native talent and marked\r\noriginality. Beginning life as a Methodist preacher, but coming to\r\nprefer the more extended opportunities for usefulness afforded by the\r\nlaw, his fame in the fifties soon spread from the Delaware to the\r\nHudson. Throwing himself with ardor into the exciting political\r\ncontests which marked this period, he was in constant demand as a\r\ncampaign speaker and his political services were recognized by a\r\nlucrative appointment under the administration of President Franklin\r\nPierce. Twice elected to the Assembly and once a candidate of his\r\nparty for the Senate, his abilities always received the cordial\r\nrecognition of the public with whom he kept constantly on good terms.\r\nThe announcement that he was to speak at a political gathering was\r\nalways sure to attract a large attendance of adherents of the\r\nopposite party for they knew they would be entertained by his sallies\r\nthough they might not be seduced by his arguments.\r\n\r\nHis control over juries was due to a mingling of magnetism and humor.\r\nHe could touch the chord of sentiment and the response was immediate.\r\nHe could cover his opponent with ridicule and the result was\r\ncontagious and convulsive laughter. No weapon is more powerful at any\r\ntime than gentle banter and no one knew better how to employ its\r\narts to the discomfiture of an adversary than Thomas J. Lyon.\r\n\r\nHis son, John W., inherits his ability and much of his originality.\r\nHe, too, has always taken a deep interest in politics and he has been\r\nheard on the platform in every campaign since 1872.\r\n\r\nHe was the pioneer of the bar in that branch of the practice which\r\nhas since assumed such proportions, railway litigation. He was the\r\nfirst to carry to the Court of Appeals many important questions,\r\nrelating to the liability of the master for injury to the employee,\r\nwhich were settled by that court in favor of the positions contended\r\nfor by him.\r\n\r\nA most interesting feature in the genealogy of the profession is the\r\nfact that the daughter of John W. Lyon, Frances D. Lyon, is also a\r\nlawyer duly admitted to practice, having supplemented her studies in\r\nher father's office by a course at the Cornell Law School from which\r\nshe graduated with honor, subsequently passing her examinations\r\nbefore the State Board. She is now engaged in practice with her\r\nfather, to whom her aid is invaluable in the office, while she has\r\nalso shown marked ability in her appearances at court.\r\n\r\nThus we have in the Lyons the only family in Orange County, except\r\nthe Gott family, in which there have been three successive\r\ngenerations of lawyers bearing the same name.\r\n\r\nEugene A. Brewster and George R. Brewster cover a period of sixty\r\nyears' continuous practice, the elder Brewster having been admitted\r\nin 1848. The judgment of his associates, placing Eugene A. Brewster\r\nin the front rank of the lawyers of his time, has already been\r\nexpressed. Upon his death his son, George R., succeeded to his\r\npractice in the same office to which for so many years the friends of\r\nhis father were accustomed to bend their steps and where they never\r\nreceived any but the most wise and judicious counsel. George R.\r\nBrewster inherits the sound judgment and conservative instincts of\r\nhis father and well maintains the dignity and responsibilities of his\r\nhonorable name and lineage. His public spirit and devotion to every\r\nworthy cause are among the most conspicuous of his traits of\r\ncharacter. Possessed of ample means and under no spur of necessity he\r\ngives freely to the public all the time he can spare from a practice\r\nwhich has been attended with great success, one of the most notable\r\nof his recent legal victories having been gained in restraining the\r\nbuilding of a railroad across his client's property.\r\n\r\nHis sense of civic duty has been strikingly exemplified in the\r\nconscientious performance of his duties as supervisor, though his\r\nacceptance of the office involved great inconvenience and sacrifice.\r\nHis labors in behalf of St. Luke's Hospital have been of inestimable\r\nvalue to that noble benefaction.\r\n\r\nIn a community as conservative as Newburgh, where one minister is\r\nstill acceptably serving his congregation for the fifty-second year\r\nand another for the thirty-fifth, it counts for something, and very\r\nproperly so, that a man should be the son and successor of an\r\nhonored, respected father. When Mr. Brewster died his son was made a\r\ndirector of the Newburgh Bank in his father's place and when Abram S.\r\nCassedy died the same course was taken in the Quassaick Bank in\r\nrespect to his son, William F. Cassedy.\r\n\r\nThe Cassedys, father and son, cover a period of fifty-one years'\r\ncontinuous practice, the elder Cassedy having been admitted in 1857.\r\nThe high place gained by him in the esteem of the bar and in the\r\nconfidence of the public has already been set forth at length. This\r\nconfidence has been transferred to his son, William F. Cassedy, to a\r\ndegree almost unprecedented in the career of a young practitioner but\r\nin every sense justified by his high character and brilliant talents.\r\nMr. Cassedy has during the last few years managed and represented\r\nestates of as great magnitude as the estates represented by all the\r\nother lawyers of Orange County combined. He has a special talent for\r\nthis important branch of the practice, but, like his father, can drop\r\nhis papers and go to court with his case well prepared for trial. The\r\nability with which he uniformly presents it to a jury is well\r\nreinforced by the same winning manner and pleasing personality which\r\nhas endeared him to so many friends.\r\n\r\nWhen Judge Charles F. Brown was in 1883 elevated to the bench of the\r\nSupreme Court, the firm of Cassedy & Brown, of which Abram S. Cassedy\r\nwas then the senior member, was, of course, dissolved. When Judge\r\nBrown retired from the bench in 1897, Mr. Cassedy having meantime\r\ndied, the names became transposed, the firm of Brown & Cassedy then\r\nformed, and still continuing, being composed of Judge Brown and\r\nWilliam F. Cassedy. That this association of his name with that of\r\nhis old partner's son should be pleasing to Judge Brown is a\r\ndistinguished mark of that great jurist's confidence, esteem and\r\naffection which indeed, are shared by all, bar and public alike, who\r\ncome to know the pure and lofty character of William F. Cassedy.\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Royce who with his son, Herbert B. Royce, is engaged in\r\npractice in Middletown, was admitted forty years ago, but being\r\npersuaded, while in the full tide of active practice, to accept the\r\nposition of president of the First National Bank in 1875, his career\r\nas a lawyer was interrupted for seventeen years. Resigning this\r\nposition, however, at the end of this period, he soon recovered his\r\nscattered practice and upon the admission to the bar of his son the\r\nfirm of William B. and Herbert B. Royce was formed. This continued\r\nuntil the autumn of 1906 when, John C. R. Taylor, having been elected\r\nto the Senate, the firm of Taylor, Royce & Royce was formed.\r\n\r\nMr. Royce has greater capacity for public business than any lawyer\r\nwho ever practiced at the bar in Orange County. His mind grasps\r\nreadily, his tastes run naturally to, every phase and variety of\r\ntown, county and municipal relations, improvements and enterprises,\r\nwith all the important questions involved in them in respect to the\r\nproper distribution of public burdens. He is an authority upon\r\ncorporation law in respect both to the organization and management of\r\ncorporations. His power of clear statement, in respect to any\r\ninvolved or intricate situation, is very great.\r\n\r\nThere is one characteristic of Mr. Royce which is fully appreciated\r\nonly by those who have been in a position to see its frequent\r\neffective exercise. He loves to settle disputes among neighbors and\r\nlitigants. He has genuine talent for making each party see how it\r\nwould benefit him to make some concession and even greater tact in\r\npointing out how certain concessions necessary to the settlement will\r\nstill leave the pride and dignity of the parties uncompromised. He\r\nabsolutely has never failed in bringing about an agreement which he\r\nstarted out to compass. Sometimes, indeed, the perverseness of the\r\nparties has seemed to make the difficulties insuperable, but this\r\nhas only spurred him on to renewed exertions. Those who know how\r\nunprofitable and unwise for both parties is any litigation which can\r\npossibly be avoided and, especially, any litigation representing only\r\nan honest difference of opinion, will realize the indebtedness of the\r\npublic to Mr. Royce for those unselfish exertions and that salutary\r\ninfluence which, throughout his entire professional career, have been\r\nsteadily, consistently and successfully directed to the promotion of\r\npeace and the soothing of angry controversy.\r\n\r\nHis son, Herbert B. Royce, who enjoyed the advantages of both the\r\nclassical and law course at Cornell University, was launched from the\r\nfirst into the activities of a busy office. Having been elected\r\nspecial county judge he has enjoyed an opportunity, in presiding over\r\nthe trial terms of the County Court, to impress his abilities upon\r\nthe bar and the public to a degree and in a manner never before\r\nenjoyed by a special county judge in the entire history of the\r\ncounty. Before Judge Beattie's time the county judges were never very\r\nconsiderate to the special county judges. They regarded them as\r\nofficers provided merely for the convenience of the bar in signing\r\norders and they affected to think that there might be some serious\r\nquestion of jurisdiction involved in their trying and sentencing\r\ncriminals, even Judge Hirschberg and Judge Beattie were never\r\ninvited, as special county judges, to hold a term of court, but the\r\njudges, when they could not act themselves, always brought in a\r\ncounty judge of a neighboring county. Judge Beattie acted more\r\ngenerously to his official coadjutor and when it became necessary for\r\nhim to surrender two terms of court. Judge Royce was requested to\r\nhold them. This service was performed by him with such marked ability\r\nand so greatly to the satisfaction of the entire bar and the public,\r\nthat Judge Seeger, who succeeded Judge Beattie in 1907, and who was\r\ndisqualified from sitting in any cases in which he, as district\r\nattorney, had procured the indictments, again summoned Judge Royce\r\nto the bench, when again he was enabled to give a public\r\ndemonstration of his judicial fitness and capacity and to prove that\r\nit will never be necessary to call in a judge from a neighboring\r\ncounty as long as Judge Royce remains special county judge.\r\n\r\nFinn & Finn is the name of the firm of which Daniel Finn was the\r\nsenior member until it was ruthlessly dissolved by the untimely hand\r\nof death, which overtook him without warning in the very midst of an\r\nunusually active and prosperous career. Admitted to the bar in 1870\r\nhe began and, for thirty-five years continued his practice in\r\nMiddletown, becoming one of the most respected and influential of its\r\ncitizens as well as one of the ablest and most trusted of its bar. He\r\nwas especially versed in the law of wills. Nothing appealed more\r\nstrongly to his interest than the ambiguous provisions of a will and\r\nthe difficult questions raised as to their proper construction. His\r\nopinions upon these were often submitted to the court with the result\r\nthat his judgment was invariably sustained.\r\n\r\nHe was the most imperturbable of men. Nothing agitated or even\r\nruffled him. He could lay down his pen to engage in an interview with\r\nsome irascible client and, after it was over, calmly resume work upon\r\nhis thoughtful brief at the very point at which it had been\r\ninterrupted. This faculty, the result of training as well as of\r\ntemperament, enabled him to accomplish a great deal of work. The day\r\nwas never spoiled for him by some untoward incident, unpleasant\r\nletter or peevish client. Each day marked distinct progress in some\r\nappointed task.\r\n\r\nMr. Finn, who drew the will of Mrs. Thrall, was deeply interested in\r\nthe noble institutions founded by her--the hospital and the library\r\nin addition to the park--and it was largely through his influence\r\nthat her thoughts were directed to these beneficent objects. It was\r\nalso through his careful prevision that her testamentary wishes in\r\nrespect to an additional endowment for the hospital were not defeated\r\nby statutory precautions. Mr. Finn foresaw that she might die within\r\nthe two months set apart, arbitrarily and without respect to\r\ntestamentary capacity, by the inscrutable wisdom of the legislature\r\nas the fluctuating hiatus, that may or may not turn out to be the\r\nvitiated period, within which testamentary benevolence must be\r\nsuspended; within which all tardy attempts of the passing soul to\r\nmake its peace with God or restitution to mankind must be overruled\r\nand nullified in favor of worthless or distant relatives; but still\r\nwithin the last day of which the cunning physician seeking to cheat\r\ndeath of its prey and rapacity of its spoils, might so galvanize into\r\nconvulsive life the dissolving frame, might so fan into flickering\r\nflame the vital spark that, in the race between greedy kindred and\r\nmelting charity, rapacity will lose by a single hour. In the case of\r\nMrs. Thrall there was no such dramatic suspense. She died twenty days\r\nafter the execution of her will; so that the bequests in her will and\r\ncodicil of twenty thousand dollars to Thrall Hospital, already\r\nfounded by her, were declared void. But Mr. Flinn also advised her to\r\ngive to her executors, Isaac R. Clements and Nathan M. Hallock,\r\nindividually, absolutely and outright all legacies which might for\r\nany reason be declared void or ineffectual, and this provision was\r\nincorporated in her codicil. After this provision had withstood in\r\nthe courts the attacks of relatives who claimed that it represented a\r\nsecret trust, equally as abhorrent to legislative solicitude for\r\nrelatives as a direct charitable bequest, Mr. Clements and Mr.\r\nHallock, in honorable recognition of Mrs. Thrall's wishes, as\r\nexpressed in her defeated bequests, but under no legal compulsion so\r\nto do, turned over to Thrall Hospital the twenty thousand dollars\r\nwhich came to them absolutely under this alternative provision. Thus\r\nwere Mr. Finn's wisdom and foresight, not only in respect to his\r\nclient's provision for the hospital but in respect to her bequest to\r\nthe city of Middletown for its library, amply justified by the event.\r\nThe bequest of $30,000, for the library was sustained by the courts.\r\nThese noble foundations--the library and the hospital--constitute an\r\nenduring monument to the generosity of S. Maretta Thrall but are no\r\nless a monument to the learning, skill and prescience of Daniel Finn.\r\nThe people of Middletown, though they have always recognized his\r\nvirtues and his abilities, but imperfectly understand the full\r\nmeasure and extent of their indebtedness to his guiding hand and\r\npublic spirit. It is simple justice to his memory that the incidents\r\nof his professional career bearing upon the public welfare should be\r\nembraced in any work professing to be history.\r\n\r\nMr. Finn's intense affection for and loyalty to his _alma mater,_\r\nHamilton College, was a very pronounced and interesting trait of his\r\ncharacter. His only son, Frank H. Finn, also graduated from this\r\nclassic institution of learning which numbers among its alumni that\r\nmost intellectual of all living American statesmen, Elihu Root.\r\n\r\nFrank H. Finn, upon being admitted to practice, entered into\r\npartnership with his father under the firm name of Finn &\r\nFinn--the name under which, notwithstanding his father's death, he\r\nand his present partner, Arthur H. Payne, himself also a graduate of\r\nHamilton College, conduct their business. Every writ and process\r\nissued by the present firm runs in the name of Finn & Finn, thus\r\nperpetuating the potent influence, the fine example and the gentle\r\nmemory of one of the purest and ablest of Orange County lawyers. It\r\nis unusual among lawyers to preserve the name, in a firm, of a\r\ndeceased partner. The only instance I recall is that of James C.\r\nCarter, whose surviving partner, Lewis Cass Ledyard, has always, with\r\na tenderness and delicacy of sentiment so in consonance with his own\r\nnoble nature and chivalric character, kept Mr. Carter's name at the\r\nhead of his firm, through all ensuing changes. The filial reverence\r\nshown by Frank H. Finn for his father's memory, his unwillingness to\r\nlet his father's name disappear at once beneath the cold waters of\r\nswift forgetfulness, illuminates his own strong and sterling\r\ncharacter. Called upon suddenly to assume charge of many intricate\r\nand involved cases pending in the office at the time of his father's\r\ndeath he accepted and discharged the painful responsibility with a\r\ndignity, firmness, manliness, courage and ability which commanded the\r\nadmiration and won the affection of the community. Though he owes\r\nmuch indeed to his noble father, he has given abundant evidence of\r\nhis capacity to stand alone. He and his brilliant partner, Mr. Payne,\r\nwill bring no reproach upon the honored name still in their pious\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nHenry W. Wiggins came to the bar two years later than Daniel Finn.\r\nThe business established by him in Middletown in 1872 is now carried\r\non by the firm of Henry W. & Russell Wiggins, father and son.\r\n\r\nHenry W. Wiggins is especially distinguished for his knowledge of the\r\nlaw of real estate, but his practice has always covered a wide range.\r\nI well remember an important litigation between mill owners in which\r\nMr. Wiggins established the right of the upper owner to substitute a\r\nturbine for an overshot wheel and to take water at a lower depth,\r\nprovided he did not use a greater quantity of water than before. His\r\nsuccess was the more notable and gratifying because he was opposed by\r\nboth Mr. Brewster and Mr. Winfield. But it has been in litigations\r\ninvolving the liability of the city of Middletown for damages that\r\nMr. Wiggins has won many of his most conspicuous triumphs. He was, at\r\nintervals, its corporation counsel for many years, his son Russell\r\nnow holding the position. It is safe to say that no city was ever\r\nmore ably served and carefully protected than the city of Middletown\r\nwas by Mr. Wiggins. No expensive condemnation proceeding in his\r\ncharge ever proved ineffective because of some flaw or oversight. No\r\nsuit for damages defended by him ever terminated in an extreme or\r\nexcessive verdict. His caution, vigilance and conscientiousness\r\ncombined with his sturdy independence in always standing his ground,\r\nin always adhering inflexibly to any position once, after due\r\nconsideration, taken by him, have been of incalculable service to his\r\nclientage and have resulted in saving to the city of Middletown alone\r\nmany thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles G. Dill.]\r\n\r\nRussell Wiggins also has enjoyed marked success in defending the\r\ninterests of the city. His recent victory in a case involving the\r\nvalidity of the provision in the charter of the city of Middletown\r\nmaking notice to the common council of snow or ice upon a sidewalk\r\nprerequisite to an action for injuries sustained in consequence of\r\nit, has attracted wide attention. Mr. Wiggins was overruled by the\r\nspecial term and by the appellate division which held that this\r\nprovision exceeded the powers of the legislature and was, therefore,\r\nunconstitutional. But Mr. Wiggins succeeded in convincing the Court\r\nof Appeals, which, in an opinion embodying the arguments advanced by\r\nhim, sustained the validity of this provision of the charter, with\r\nthe result that all actions of this class are practically done away\r\nwith, it is not surprising that all the cities of the State have been\r\nso impressed with the importance of Mr. Wiggins' victory that they\r\nare now trying to secure a similar provision in their own charters.\r\nIt seems, indeed, somewhat hard that a total stranger, alighting from\r\na train on a dark night, should be compelled to proceed at his peril\r\nalong a city street, under conditions which physically exclude his\r\neither having or giving notice, but Mr. Wiggins ingeniously persuaded\r\nthe Court of Appeals to say that this is a question for the\r\nlegislature and not for the courts, thus establishing a new\r\nprecedent, if not a new principle, in constitutional construction, in\r\na case sure to become a leading one; sure to be cited for many years\r\nto come, in the courts of the entire country. In thus linking his\r\nname at the very outset of his career, to a leading authority, Mr.\r\nWiggins has set for himself a hard task. He must now live up to his\r\nown reputation--which there is abundant reason to believe he is\r\nentirely able to do.\r\n\r\nCornelius E. Cuddeback, admitted to the bar in 1873, immediately\r\nestablished in Port Jervis the business now carried on under the\r\nfirm name of C. E. & S. M. Cuddeback, his son Samuel M. having become\r\nassociated with him.\r\n\r\nMr. Cuddeback early became prominent in all the interests of the\r\ncommunity, social, business, legal and public--a position which he\r\nmaintains by virtue of his unquestioned integrity, great ability and\r\nenormous industry. He was largely instrumental in straightening out\r\nthe affairs of the Port Jervis & Monticello Railroad Company, and he\r\nhas for many years been the attorney for the town of Deer Park and\r\nthe village (now the city) of Port Jervis. He has also been the\r\nattorney for many public service corporations. His defense of the\r\nBarrett Bridge Company in a test case tried at Goshen in June, 1905,\r\nto determine the liability of the company for the deaths occasioned\r\nby the sweeping away of the bridge over the Delaware River in a\r\nfreshet, furnishes a fine example of his characteristics as a lawyer.\r\nThe defense was prepared with a thoroughness, exhaustiveness and\r\ncomprehensiveness and conducted with a verve, vigor and vivacity\r\nwhich carried everything before it, sweeping away the case of the\r\nplaintiff as ruthlessly as the freshet swept away the bridge; leaving\r\nlittle for the jury to do but to register the fact that the defense\r\nhad been completely successful.\r\n\r\nMr. Cuddeback finds in his son a lawyer well qualified to assume the\r\nburdens of his practice when he shall be prepared to lay them down.\r\n\r\nAll the living lawyers thus far considered, except the sons and\r\ndaughter, will very soon be passing from the scene. The pages that\r\nbear this imprint will scarcely be flung from the press before the\r\nlawyers whose now familiar names they carry forward to a generation\r\nthat knows them not, will drop away, one by one, from their\r\naccustomed places. So true is this, so strong is the author's sense\r\nthat only, by slight anticipation, do these pages commemorate the\r\ndeparted, that nothing has been set down here which could not be\r\ntruthfully and becomingly said if they had gone before who yet, for a\r\nlittle, linger. This, indeed, suggests the chief reason why the\r\npresent record, to be of any value, should include the living; for\r\nlong before this publication is superseded by a rival or a successor\r\nthe figures it portrays will have passed from action to remembrance.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this thought it is proper to point out that the\r\nsketches and estimates now published bear this further resemblance to\r\nveracious and posthumous biography--they have not been edited by the\r\nsubjects. The system adopted in some modern compilations of\r\npermitting prominent men to write their own biographies, or of\r\nprocuring from them the data for less sympathetic treatment, has not\r\nbeen followed here. Indeed, with a single accidental and\r\ninsignificant exception, not one lawyer has any knowledge of the\r\nscope or purpose of this undertaking or has furnished any information\r\navailable for use in it. He who carelessly takes up this volume to\r\nread about others will be covered with modest confusion to find\r\nhimself included in it. This is an attempt not to let a man speak for\r\nhimself, but to collect and crystallize in definite forms of\r\nexpression the floating particles of contemporary judgment upon his\r\ncharacter. It is for this reason, besides others, that so few\r\nspecific dates and irrelevant facts are given. They have not been\r\nasked for. They are not needed. They do not fit with the scheme of\r\nthis work, which aims, perhaps presumptuously, but still\r\nconsistently, to be a gallery of portraits, not a table of\r\nstatistics. Of what possible interest is it to know the number of a\r\nlawyer's children, or the building in which his office is located?\r\nCharacter and achievement are the things that count.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient at this point to return to the consideration of\r\nthe leading advocates now at the bar of the county. No one recognizes\r\nmore than advocates themselves their frequent indebtedness to the\r\ngreat lawyers who, undisturbed by absorbing, distracting and\r\nexhausting trials, apply to life's complex and varying conditions the\r\nimmutable principles of the common law. It implies no disparagement\r\nof Winfield and Gedney to assume that the one often leaned upon the\r\njudgment of his partner, William F. Sharpe, and that the other often\r\nsought the wise counsel of his esteemed relative, Joseph W. Gott. At\r\nthe same time it cannot be doubted that public interest has always\r\ncentered upon the trial lawyer, for the obvious reason that the open\r\nfield, the public challenge, the combat of intellectual athletes, the\r\npalm of victory appeal strongly to the imagination and dramatic\r\nsense. There need, therefore, be no apology for making prominent in a\r\npopular work those who engage the larger share of merely popular\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThere is no man at the bar of Orange County, or indeed anywhere, for\r\nwhom the term colorless would be so inept as it would be for Judge\r\nAlbert H. F. Seeger. He radiates color. He is the incarnation of\r\nsunshine. He is the forerunner of gladness, sounding a proclamation\r\nof hope and good cheer wherever he goes. No one would suppose that he\r\never had a care or sorrow. Yet he must have had his share. He\r\nperforms more perfectly than any man I ever knew that mission which\r\nRobert Louis Stevenson glorifies when he says:\r\n\r\n\"There is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy. A\r\nhappy man or woman is a better thing to find than a five-pound note.\r\nHe or she is a radiating focus of good will; and their entrance into\r\na room is as though another candle had been lighted. We need not care\r\nwhether they could prove the forty-seventh proposition; they do a\r\nbetter thing than that, they practically demonstrate the great\r\ntheorem of the livableness of life.\"\r\n\r\nBut Judge Seeger can also prove the forty-seventh proposition. He can\r\nusually prove anything he sets out to prove, as lawyers opposed to\r\nhim have often found to their dismay. And even when the law and the\r\nfacts are all against him and you have him thoroughly beaten,\r\naccording, to all the rules of the game, there will still be three to\r\nsix jurors who strangely refuse to believe that anything but\r\ninfallible argument could emanate from a personality so radiant. Not\r\nthat his propositions always need the support of his personality,\r\nupon which, indeed, he never consciously presumes. He always builds\r\nup a strong, solid, telling, convincing argument, delivered with\r\nunaffected earnestness and artless sincerity.\r\n\r\nAnd his sincerity really is artless. While he is personally the most\r\npopular man in Orange County and while such preeminence can only be\r\nattained by the use of popular arts, yet in his case they are\r\nentirely legitimate and unstudied. He really does feel kindness when\r\nhe seems to. He really is interested in the things which interest\r\nothers. He really does love their babies, their dogs, their\r\nhorses--anything, in fact, but their automobiles. His bubbling\r\nspirits and effervescent mirth, his ready wit and sparkling sally,\r\nthe ring of his laughter and the spell of his bonhomie are all the\r\ngenuine expression of a rich, ardent and impressionable nature.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that such a man would be a time-server. Far from\r\nit. There is not a trace of the demagogue in his composition. Much as\r\nhe would naturally desire to retain his remarkable popularity he\r\nwould fling it all away, if necessary, in the performance of his duty\r\nor in the defense of law and order. He showed this unmistakably when\r\nas district attorney he boldly held at bay the lawless mob, at a\r\npersonal risk which his official duties did not call upon him to\r\nincur. Knowing then that he would soon be a candidate for a higher\r\noffice he cared not whether he made friends or enemies, whether he\r\nlost votes or gained them; he simply saw his duty and went straight\r\nfor it. As it was, the very forces he antagonized respected him. When\r\nthis genial friend, this blithe companion became transformed into the\r\nstern, unyielding, inexorable officer of the law the very mob he awed\r\nretired to worship him, and when the time came it voted for him.\r\n\r\nThis mingling in Judge Seeger's character of the sterner and softer\r\nelements, of courage and tenderness, manliness and simplicity,\r\nfirmness and forgiveness, has inspired in the people of Orange County\r\na respect and affection such as rarely attends upon a public man. His\r\nelection to the office of county judge was inevitable whether the\r\n\"organization\" had been friendly or not. If it constitutes high\r\nqualifications for this responsible position to possess a character\r\nnoble and sincere, a disposition just and fair, a judgment sound and\r\ntrue, a mind well trained and informed, a knowledge of the law wide\r\nand various, a knowledge of human nature keen and close, a sense of\r\npublic duty deep and earnest, then is the county of Orange indeed\r\nfortunate that a judge as respected as John J. Beattie should be\r\nfollowed by a successor so worthy as Albert H. F. Seeger.\r\n\r\nFrom painting to stenography; from stenography to the law; from the\r\nlaw to the recovery of a judgment for eight hundred thousand dollars\r\nin 1906--that is the condensed history of Thomas Watts. As the\r\npainting was, not of pictures but, of houses, it will readily be seen\r\nthat he is the most consummate embodiment of that familiar phrase,\r\nthe self-made man, that the Orange County bar possesses. After\r\nworking all day painting, often walking back several miles to his\r\nhome, he spent his evenings studying stenography. After acquiring\r\nthis art and while pursuing its practice as a court stenographer he\r\nstudied law assiduously, following carefully also the course of every\r\ncase that came under his notice in court and drawing out the able\r\njudges and lawyers whom he met in conversation that was not less\r\ninstructive than edifying.\r\n\r\nBorn in England, about the same time that Judge Seeger was born in\r\nGermany, and brought to this country at an early age by his parents,\r\nas Judge Seeger was also, the career of both men is a striking\r\nillustration of what may be accomplished in this land of opportunity,\r\nwithout the social influence of generations of local ancestry, by\r\nsheer pluck, perseverance, energy and ability.\r\n\r\nMr. Watts is a very nucleus of abounding and super-abounding energy.\r\nHe generates energy by a process of spontaneous mental combustion.\r\nHis mental activity is more continuous and intense than any I have\r\never known. His mind never goes fallow, but seems to be constantly\r\nfructified by the floating pollen in the business, legal or\r\nintellectual atmosphere surrounding him. It is of course inevitable\r\nthat, with such a temperament, he should repeatedly cross the path of\r\npeople who would like to have him keep out of their way. But Mr.\r\nWatts is so constituted that where other people are there would he be\r\nalso; and he is always willing to keep out of their way by letting\r\nthem step aside.\r\n\r\nYet, despite all his initiative, aggressiveness and combativeness\r\nwith respect to those who can meet him upon equal terms, he is\r\ntenderness and generosity itself to the weak, the helpless and the\r\ndependent. He has been known to pour out his bounty for years upon\r\nthose who appealed to his sympathy or invoked his aid. He has, in a\r\nmarked degree, the English love of fair play and is as ready to\r\nacknowledge a mistake as he is to resent an injury. Often brusque and\r\nimpulsive in his manner when no offense is intended, and quick to\r\nregret when it is, he is always surprised to find that others are not\r\nso ready to forget as he is to forgive.\r\n\r\nThe fighting qualities of Mr. Watts are never shown to better\r\nadvantage than when he is asserting the rights of the poor and weak\r\nagainst all the resources of corporate or individual wealth. He never\r\ntires. His tenacity cannot be shaken. No reversal of the first\r\njudgment dismays him. He enters upon the second or third trial with\r\nas much vigor and vim as upon the first. In one case he more than\r\ndoubled upon the second trial the verdict obtained upon the first\r\ntrial. Indeed he has led in the securing of large verdicts, having\r\nobtained the largest verdict in a death case ever rendered in the\r\ncounty and the largest verdict, with one exception, ever rendered for\r\npersonal injuries.\r\n\r\nThe judgment for eight hundred thousand dollars to which reference\r\nhas been made was obtained by Mr. Watts in an action brought by him\r\nfor a contractor against a railroad company for extra work in the\r\nbuilding of a branch, disputed by the company. Mr. Watts examined and\r\ncross-examined all the witnesses and, with the aid of his office\r\nforce, prepared the final argument. He was opposed by the finest\r\nlegal talent in the State and the case was tried before that learned,\r\neminent and profoundly respected judge, the Honorable Alton B.\r\nParker, sitting as referee. The case involved many intricate\r\nquestions of which Mr. Watts exhibited entire mastery. His management\r\nof this case marks the zenith of his ability and reputation as a\r\ntrial lawyer. A lawyer who, before such a tribunal, wins such a case,\r\ninvolving such large interests and attended with results of such\r\nmagnitude, for the judgment was not only obtained but settled, has\r\nestablished his place, beyond all question, in the very front rank of\r\nthe trial lawyers of the State.\r\n\r\nMr. Watts excels in cross-examination. In a case brought by him for\r\ninjuries resulting from the explosion of a locomotive boiler, the\r\njudge hesitated at the close of his case about letting it proceed,\r\nbut finally ruled that the railroad company should go on with its\r\nproof, reserving the questions that troubled him. Mr. Watts thereupon\r\ntook the defendant's witnesses in hand and on cross-examination he\r\nso completely established the liability of the company out of the\r\nmouths of its own witnesses that all thought, not merely of non-suit,\r\nbut of defense even was abandoned and the company was thrown into a\r\npanic. It made an offer in the recess and when the court convened\r\nagain to resume the case it was announced as settled.\r\n\r\nMr. Watts' addresses to the jury are marked by pith, point and\r\npiquancy. He emphasizes the salient features of the case and lets all\r\nminor or subordinate issues take care of themselves. His sturdy\r\ndefense of his client's rights, his strong individuality and his\r\nintellectual force combine to make him a formidable opponent.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no lawyer at the bar of Orange County ever received a more\r\nemphatic, pronounced, unmistakable tribute of personal regard than\r\nJohn C. R. Taylor, of Middletown, received at the election of 1906,\r\nwhen, in a district opposed to him politically, he ran over four\r\nthousand ahead of his ticket and was elected Senator by a majority of\r\nover twelve hundred. The good opinion of him thus expressed by his\r\nfellow citizens has been confirmed by his broad, patriotic,\r\nstatesmanlike course at Albany, which has attracted the attention and\r\ncommended him to the approbation, of the entire State, without\r\nrespect to party lines. The purity of his character, the singleness\r\nof his motives, the soundness of his judgment and the independence of\r\nhis action carried him in a single session to a position of weight\r\nand influence usually acquired only after several terms of\r\nlegislative service. Senator Taylor is one of those public servants\r\nwho believe that the State is a great business corporation of which\r\nthe Governor is president and each Senator a trustee. Under this\r\nconviction he refuses to consider either party advantage or private\r\ninterests but seeks to ascertain solely what is best for the welfare\r\nof the people and the cause of good government. Whether he can\r\nrepeat his phenomenal success at the polls under less favorable\r\nconditions is of course uncertain. But whether he does or not he has\r\nset an example of clean, straightforward, high-minded methods in\r\npolitics and legislation which will long be remembered in his\r\ndistrict. He has set a standard of political morals which will have\r\nto be satisfied by any successor who hopes to retain the mandate of a\r\nnow aroused, vigilant, exacting and independent public conscience.\r\n\r\nSenator Taylor's success at the bar was almost as immediate as his\r\nlater success in the Senate. Early in his practice he went to\r\nKingston to try a case against one of the leaders of the famous\r\nUlster County bar and obtained a verdict of $10,000 in an action\r\nagainst the town of Shawangunk for damages resulting from a defective\r\nbridge, a verdict which was subsequently paid after passing the\r\nordeal of all the courts. Judge Clearwater who presided over the\r\ntrial and whose qualifications as a critic will be conceded, since he\r\nhas himself made both the bar and bench illustrious, told me that he\r\nhad never seen a case more ably tried and presented than this case\r\nwas by Mr. Taylor.\r\n\r\nSenator Taylor has the courage of the true lawyer. When a few years\r\nago he was engaged to defend a client accused of a shocking offense,\r\npeople went to him and said, \"Why, you will be ruined if you defend\r\nthat man.\" He simply replied, \"He is my client and I shall stand by\r\nhim to the end.\" Senator Taylor not only was not \"ruined\" but he\r\ncompletely reversed public sentiment which had been misled from the\r\nstart, and established his client's entire innocence of the charge\r\nagainst him in a crushing cross-examination of the first witness\r\nwhich demonstrated its complete falsity.\r\n\r\nSenator Taylor's professional ideals are as high as his political\r\nideals. He is an honorable foe, a straight lawyer, a cultured\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nMichael N. Kane, of Warwick, the most beautiful village in the\r\ncounty, if not in the State, also received at the election of 1906 a\r\nvote for the office of supreme court judge which strikingly attested\r\nthe admiration and regard in which he is held by his fellow citizens\r\nin the county and district. He ran several thousand ahead of his\r\nticket but this was not sufficient to overcome the adverse majority\r\ncaused by the creation of the new ninth judicial district out of the\r\nriver counties. Mr. Kane has securely established his reputation as a\r\ntrial lawyer of conspicuous ability and success. He is frequently\r\nemployed as counsel in important cases and has never failed to\r\nsatisfy the expectations of both attorney and client. His preparation\r\nof cases for trial is complete and masterly.\r\n\r\nIn the appellate courts his arguments are marked by a learning,\r\nlucidity and power which always command attention and usually assent.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of character and fineness of moral fibre which have\r\ncontributed so largely to his professional success are displaced in\r\nall his relations to his professional brethren, in which he is the\r\npattern and exemplar of uniform courtesy, consideration and\r\nindulgence. While never imperiling the interests of a client to\r\naccommodate a professional brother he is always able to find a way to\r\naccommodate him without injuring his client. He never takes refuge in\r\nthe transparent pretext that his client will not consent, which is\r\nthe customary formula used to cover, though it does not conceal,\r\nprofessional churlishness. In the very cases in which Mr. Kane has\r\nbeen most generous to his opponents he has had the most complete\r\nultimate success; thus furnishing to his brethren of the bar an\r\nobject lesson from which they may learn that courtesy to each other\r\nis entirely consistent with perfect loyalty to their client.\r\n\r\nMr. Kane's public spirit has always been a noticeable phase of his\r\ncharacter. His pride in and devotion to the interests of Warwick have\r\nendeared him to his community which not only respects him as a lawyer\r\nbut esteems him as a neighbor and honors him as a citizen.\r\n\r\nFerdinand V. Sanford is another citizen of Warwick whose abilities\r\nentitle him to rank among the trial lawyers of the county. Fluent in\r\nspeech, cultivated in manner and refined in character, his personal\r\ncharm imparts weight to his opinion and impulsion to his utterances.\r\nHe, too, is deeply interested in his beautiful village, the citizens\r\nof which have bestowed upon him many marks of their favor and\r\nconfidence. His prominence in its affairs led to a most interesting\r\nexperience in the summer of 1906 when he represented his village at\r\nthe brilliant and imposing pageant held In old Warwick in England at\r\nwhich he upheld the reputation abroad of American oratory in a most\r\ngraceful, felicitous and eloquent address.\r\n\r\nDarwin W. Esmond, of Newburgh, prepares his cases for trial more\r\nthoroughly than any lawyer I ever knew. His trial brief is\r\ncomprehensive, elaborate, and minute, even containing instructions in\r\nreference to the cross-examination of the witnesses expected to be\r\ncalled by his opponent. Every case likely to be cited by his opponent\r\nis discussed and distinguished. Every pitfall into which his opponent\r\nmight seek to draw him is pointed out and provided against. If he\r\nshould die the day before a case is set down for trial and it should\r\nbe thought best, notwithstanding, to go on with the trial, any\r\nexperienced trial lawyer could, on a moment's notice, take his brief\r\nand try the case without consulting an authority, seeing a witness,\r\nor even talking with the client. He would find his opening to the\r\njury outlined for him, the statements of the witnesses arranged in\r\nthe order in which they should be adduced, the authorities bearing\r\nupon a motion for non-suit carefully analyzed and, finally, the\r\npoints to be dwelt upon in the submission to the jury clearly\r\nemphasized.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that such painstaking industry implies the most\r\nconscientious devotion on the part of Mr. Esmond to his client's\r\ncause--a devotion as earnest and intense when the amount involved is\r\nsmall as when it is large. His theory is that a small case is just as\r\nimportant to a poor man as a large case is to a rich one and that the\r\nmeasure of duty, of fidelity and of devotion should be the same in\r\neach.\r\n\r\nBut mere industry is of little avail in the law unless directed by\r\nability. It is a valuable supplement to ability, never a substitute\r\nfor it. Mr. Esmond has all the qualifications of an able trial\r\nlawyer. I once saw him in Kingston pitted against one of the leaders\r\nof the Ulster County bar overturn by the sheer force of his ability\r\nand address, all the prejudices first formed against his client, the\r\ndefendant, in the mind of both court and jury, in a case in which the\r\nplaintiff, an old man, was seeking the restoration of property turned\r\nover by him to his son. I heard Judge Chester say that in the\r\nbeginning of the trial he thought the plaintiff was right but that as\r\nthe case proceeded his mind changed. This result was due solely to\r\nthe splendid defense made by Mr. Esmond in a case which from the\r\nstart was full of elements of danger and defeat.\r\n\r\nMr. Esmond has always taken a prominent part in the literary life of\r\nthe community and in the discussion of public topics. His services to\r\nthe Chautauqua society have been most valuable, while his own\r\naddresses upon a large variety of topics have been a distinct\r\ncontribution to the literature of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate indeed for Mr. Esmond at this time that he has all\r\nthese resources to fall back upon; else might he have been wholly\r\ncrushed by the cruel sorrow that came to him and his devoted wile in\r\nthe recent loss of their only child, Paul Warner Esmond, one of the\r\nmost precocious, promising and brilliant boys who ever lived. His\r\npoems, dealing with the problems of life and death, are as mature,\r\nreflective and suggestive as though written by a man of fifty. That\r\nsuch a child of genius should be snatched away when the angel of\r\ndeath leaves untouched so many circles from which one could be better\r\nspared, is a mystery that has never ceased to perplex mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. A. Brewster]\r\n\r\nHoward Thornton, of Newburgh, _bel-esprit,_ _bon-vivant_ and\r\nraconteur, the favorite of society and the delight of dinner tables,\r\nis not one whit less a good lawyer because he can smooth away the\r\ndifficulties of a hostess in entertaining her guests as easily as he\r\ncan glide over the difficulties of his client's case in court. The\r\nbest lawyers have always shone in society, from Hamilton to Choate,\r\nand Mr. Thornton's social gifts have never interfered with his\r\ndevotion to his profession. Every morning, year in and year out, the\r\nearly riser can see Mr. Thornton at seven o'clock wending his way to\r\nhis office where by ten o'clock he has already accomplished a day's\r\nwork and is ready to talk with his clients.\r\n\r\nMr. Thornton has always found his chief pleasure in some abstruse\r\nquestion arising out of the law of wills or of real estate. He has\r\nbeen drawn into some very important litigations involving the\r\nconstruction of the transfer tax law and his contentions have been\r\nuniformly sustained by the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nMr. Thornton's service in the Assembly, of which he was for three\r\nyears a member, showed his capacity for public affairs. He was\r\nchairman of the judiciary committee and took high rank in legislation\r\nand politics. But his tastes incline him to the more arduous and less\r\ndevious duties of his profession in which he has gained the\r\nreputation of an honorable, talented and brilliant lawyer.\r\n\r\nRussel Headley, of Newburgh, is the son of the eminent historian Joel\r\nT. Headley from whom, doubtless, he inherits those literary gifts\r\nwhich account in part for the direction of his energies into the\r\nfield of legal authorship. But this is not the only reason. It is but\r\njustice to him that it should be known that Mr. Headley was\r\ninterrupted in the very midst of a brilliant career at the bar by the\r\ncoming on of that most disqualifying of all infirmities for an\r\nadvocate--deafness. This naturally had the effect of turning Mr.\r\nHeadley to the labors of authorship for which his inherited tastes\r\nand acquired accomplishments so well fitted him. His works upon\r\nassignments, witnesses and criminal justice are well known to and\r\nwidely read by the profession.\r\n\r\nMr. Headley filled the position of district attorney of Orange County\r\nfor two terms. He especially distinguished himself at this time by\r\nhis abilities as a trial lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Headley accepted in 1902 and still holds a position in the legal\r\ndivision of the State Excise Department at Albany. His research, his\r\nfaculty for writing sound, able, exhaustive opinions and his\r\nknowledge of the law of pleadings make him a most valuable member of\r\nthe legal staff of that very important branch of the public service,\r\nin which questions are constantly arising which could scarcely be\r\nexpected to come within the purview of an arm of the service devoted\r\nto the enforcement of a single law. In this work Mr. Headley is able\r\nto reconcile himself to the surrender of those more spectacular\r\ntriumphs of the court room in which his activities and his ambition\r\nonce found a more congenial field.\r\n\r\nCornelius L. Waring, of Newburgh, is an authority in the law of\r\nmunicipal corporations. He was for many years the attorney for the\r\ncity, the interests of which he always most zealously and\r\nsuccessfully protected. He has a large general practice including\r\namong his clients some wealthy business corporations.\r\n\r\nMr. Waring has had wide experience in the trial of cases. His manner\r\nin court is marked by dignity, determination and persistence. He\r\nnever yields a point on his own side and he never fails to seize upon\r\nthe weak point in the case of his adversary. His arguments are terse,\r\ndirect and forceful, always commanding ready and respectful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nElmer E. Roosa, of the Newburgh bar, who was associated with Judge\r\nHirschberg at the time he ascended the bench, succeeded in large part\r\nto the prestige of an office which had been established for nearly\r\nthirty years. The confidence always reposed in him by Judge\r\nHirschberg is shared by a large body of devoted clients who find in\r\nhim a safe, discreet and honorable counselor.\r\n\r\nEdward J. Collins, of Newburgh, who is associated in practice with\r\nJudge Seeger, possesses in a high degree that dignity of bearing and\r\nof character which well supports professional attainments of a\r\nsuperior order. He has been honored by his fellow citizens by\r\nrepeated marks of their confidence. He was for some years president\r\nof the common council of the city of Newburgh, a position which\r\nbrought into prominence his fine qualities of mind and character.\r\n\r\nHenry R. Lydecker, of Newburgh, has the most amiable disposition of\r\nany lawyer at the bar. If he were more self-assertive his abilities\r\nwould be more widely appreciated. He showed marked ability in his\r\nservice four successive winters in the attorney general's office at\r\nAlbany in the work of reviewing for constitutional and other\r\nobjections, the bills sent by the Legislature to the Governor. This\r\nappointment was made each year and would not have been repeatedly\r\nconferred unless the discharge of his important duties had proved to\r\nbe able and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMr. Lydecker has recently received, at the instance of Presiding\r\nJustice Hirschberg, an appointment upon the clerical force of the\r\nAppellate Division--another evidence of the high opinion entertained\r\nof him by governors, attorneys general and judges alike.\r\n\r\nJ. Renwick Thompson, Jr., of Newburgh, is still permitted to write\r\n\"junior\" to a noble and conspicuous senior, who now for more than\r\nfifty years has ministered over one of the most important churches\r\nand congregations in Newburgh. Mr. Thompson's character and standing\r\nwholly contradict the adage about \"ministers' sons.\" In his keeping\r\nall the traditions of an honorable lineage are safe, while a large\r\nand increasing clientage can testify that in his hands are equally\r\nsafe all the interests committed to him.\r\n\r\nElwood C. Smith, who has an office in Turner as well as in Newburgh,\r\nhas advanced rapidly in reputation and standing. His agreeable\r\nmanners and attractive personality always create a favorable\r\nimpression sure to be confirmed by future acquaintance with his\r\ncharacter and abilities. He enjoys the respect of the community and\r\nthe confidence of a very considerable clientage.\r\n\r\nN. Deyo Belknap, of Newburgh. has shown great talent in all his\r\nappearances in court and is a rising aspirant for professional\r\nhonors. In an action brought by him for the construction of a will he\r\nexhibited all the qualities of a mature and experienced practitioner.\r\nHis success at the bar has been immediate and pronounced.\r\n\r\nR. H. Barnett, of Newburgh. has made a specialty of negligence\r\nactions. Like his great exemplar, John M. Gardner, he never concedes\r\nthat he is beaten. He always renews the argument to the court, after\r\nbeing non-suited, so undauntedly that the court often reverses itself\r\nand lets the case go to the jury, before which Mr. Barnett meets with\r\nunvarying success. A jury always admires pluck and pertinacity and\r\nthese qualities Mr. Barnett possesses in a marked degree.\r\n\r\nGraham Witschief, of Newburgh, would attract attention in any\r\nassembly for the intellectual cast of his features, which clearly\r\nbetoken unusual talent. This impression is at once confirmed when he\r\naddresses the court. He so excels in the power of lucid statement\r\nthat by the time he has informed the court of the nature of the\r\ncontroversy he has already produced the effect of an argument. This\r\nfaculty of seizing upon the crucial, controlling points of the case,\r\nof applying the philosophical rather than the historical method, is\r\none of the rarest among lawyers, who usually narrate the facts in the\r\norder in which they occurred, leaving the court to pick out the\r\nessential, determining elements from a mass of more or less related\r\nmatter. This gift Mr. Witschief possesses to a degree so unusual that\r\nit constitutes a large factor in the success which he has so rapidly\r\nattained. He is a rising advocate, taking his place easily among the\r\nleaders of the Orange County bar.\r\n\r\nBenjamin McClung, of Newburgh, obtained, early in his practice, a\r\nforemost position at the bar of the county. One of his first and most\r\nnotable victories, which attracted wide attention at the time, was\r\nwon in a proceeding instituted by him in 1892 to require the registry\r\nboard of the town of Highlands to strike from the register the names\r\nof over a hundred soldiers quartered at West Point, who claimed the\r\nright to vote in the village of Highland Falls, adjoining the\r\nGovernment reservation. Mr. McClung took the position that the West\r\nPoint reservation is not a part of the territory of the State of New\r\nYork; that upon the cession of the territory by the State the general\r\ngovernment became invested with exclusive jurisdiction over it and\r\nthat persons resident within it are not entitled to vote. Mr.\r\nMcClung, notwithstanding the limited time at his disposal, upon the\r\nvery eve of an exciting election, made a most exhaustive and\r\nconvincing argument, collating all the authorities and relying\r\nchiefly upon the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Fort\r\nLeavenworth Railroad Company vs. Lowe, which involved the character\r\nof Government property at Fort Leavenworth. Though he was opposed by\r\nsuch eminent counsel as Judge Hirschberg, Walter C. Anthony and\r\nHoward Thornton, his argument was sustained by the court and the law\r\nupon the subject was finally established in this State.\r\n\r\nHis stubborn defense a few years ago of an unpopular client will be\r\nlong remembered. So strong was the public sentiment against his\r\nclient and so thoroughly had the court room been surcharged with this\r\nsentiment that it was impossible for Mr. McClung to prevent his\r\nclient's conviction of the offense of receiving stolen property,\r\nknowing it to be stolen. But, nothing daunted, Mr. McClung procured a\r\nstay of the sentence, reversed the conviction on appeal, and on the\r\nsecond trial cleared his client triumphantly, the court saying that\r\nthe proof for the prosecution did not make the slightest progress\r\ntoward fastening guilt upon the defendant. This case affords a\r\nstriking illustration of the dangers that often surround innocent men\r\nin the artificially superheated atmosphere of a court room created by\r\nan excited and credulous public opinion eager for a victim. Had it\r\nnot been for Mr. McClung's steadfast, stalwart and fearless exertions\r\nin this case, in the face of much hostile criticism, an absolutely\r\ninnocent man, as subsequently ascertained by the court, would have\r\nbeen consigned to the ignominy of a term in State prison. Mr.\r\nMcClung's action in thus stemming the tide of adverse, powerful and\r\nmalignant influences bent upon crushing and ruining his client cannot\r\nbe overestimated. It attests his place at the Orange County bar not\r\nmerely for intellectual ability but for that moral courage which\r\nconstitutes the very highest attribute, the noblest equipment of the\r\nadvocate.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. McClung's manly, independent and intrepid character is\r\nunderstood and admired by the public was strikingly shown in the fall\r\nof 1907 by his election to the office of mayor of the city of\r\nNewburgh by a majority of over five hundred votes, overcoming an\r\nadverse majority of about five hundred usually cast in that city\r\nagainst the candidate of his party. The people evidently believed\r\nthat Mr. McClung is imbued with the idea that a municipal corporation\r\nis, in its last analysis, simply a business corporation in which each\r\ntaxpayer is a stockholder, the aldermen its directors and the mayor\r\nits business manager.\r\n\r\nMr. McClung has already shown that this confidence in his character\r\nand aims is well founded. He may be relied upon to give the people a\r\npurely business administration unfettered by political obligations\r\nand uninfluenced by the desire to build up a personal machine or to\r\nreward a band of hungry parasites.\r\n\r\nHenry Kohl, of Newburgh, now the partner of Mr. McClung, is also a\r\nfighter. His tastes and his sympathies incline him to espouse the\r\nweaker cause, and he is often assigned by the court to defend those\r\nwho are unable to employ counsel. I remember a notable case in which\r\nhe was thus assigned arising out of the killing of a motorman by the\r\nalleged criminal negligence of another motorman in causing a\r\ncollision. The indictment was for manslaughter and the trolley\r\ncompany refused to give any assistance to the accused motorman, who\r\nlanguished several months in the county jail while his case was being\r\ntossed back and forth between the supreme and county courts. Mr. Kohl\r\ntook hold of the case and so stoutly convinced several jurors that\r\nthe fault was that of the company in not providing the motorman with\r\nproper appliances that a disagreement was secured and the motorman\r\ndischarged on his own recognizance. This illustrates the quality of\r\nMr. Kohl's work--earnest, strong, enthusiastic, courageous, loyal.\r\nNothing dismays him. The more able and astute his opponent, the\r\nbetter he is satisfied, since it proportionately increases his credit\r\nin beating him, as he always expects to do, and frequently does.\r\n\r\nMr. Kohl is a verdict getter. His recent success in getting a verdict\r\nfor $9,000 in a negligence case was a gratifying one, while he also\r\nrecently secured a favorable settlement in a case against the city\r\ngrowing out of the fall of a tree in a high wind, causing the death\r\nof a young lady. The lawyers who start in to try a case against\r\nHenry Kohl know that in him they will find an opponent equipped at\r\nevery point and with every art to sway a jury and to save his client.\r\nHe has forged his way ahead until now he is in the front rank of\r\nOrange County's trial lawyers.\r\n\r\nJ. Bradley Scott, of Newburgh, is the son of that noble lawyer. David\r\nA. Scott, whose precious legacy of an honorable name is guarded well\r\nby the son, who came to the bar several years after his father's\r\ndeath. He has developed far more fondness for the trial of cases than\r\nhis father had and has already achieved a distinct standing as a\r\ntrial lawyer. His recent success before the appellate courts, in the\r\ncase involving the right of a soda water establishment to refuse to\r\nfurnish soda water upon request to a colored person, has attracted\r\ngreat attention. The case involves grave questions and far-reaching\r\nconsequences. Mr. Scott's broad, powerful and convincing argument in\r\nit shows that he inherits not only the good name but also the fine\r\nintellectual, discriminating qualities of his distinguished father.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Decker, of Middletown, is the dean of its trial lawyers. He\r\nis the one first asked upon every public occasion to voice its\r\nspirit, or its purpose, filling in this respect the part so often\r\ntaken by Mr. Winfield, who was, by the way, until his death, always\r\none of Mr. Decker's warmest friends and admirers.\r\n\r\nPossessed of a highly sensitive, responsive nature, a poetic,\r\nimaginative temperament, an exquisitely nervous organization, his\r\nfibre is almost too fine for the buffetings and shocks of the court\r\nroom. While his brilliant mind, his legal attainments and his\r\noratorical powers have always been exhibited in the court room to\r\ngreat advantage and with marked success, yet he has often declined\r\nconflicts in which, if he had entered upon them, not he, but his\r\nopponent, would have had occasion to regret it. Mr. Decker has always\r\nplaced a far more modest estimate upon his own abilities than he\r\nshould have done, and a far lower estimate than that of the public,\r\nby which he is unreservedly admired and respected.\r\n\r\nMr. Decker's gifts as a public speaker, his scholarly tastes and his\r\nliterary attainments are never shown to greater advantage than upon\r\nthe lecture platform, from which he has often instructed and\r\ndelighted a cultured audience. His recent series of brilliant\r\nlectures upon Edgar Allan Poe will be long remembered.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Decker's admission to the bar in 1870 he formed a\r\npartnership, under the name of McQuoid & Decker, with Henry M.\r\nMcQuoid, who died a few years later. Mr. McQuoid's portrait hangs in\r\nMr. Decker's office, but there is little else to remind us now of one\r\nwho once occupied a large place in the interest and attention of the\r\npublic. Mr. McQuoid was distinguished for bold, dashing, sparkling\r\nqualities as a trial lawyer. Soon after Judge Groo moved from\r\nMonticello to Middletown in 1866 he and Mr. McQuoid were opposed to\r\neach other in a trial in which Mr. McQuoid disputed all of Judge\r\nGroo's legal propositions with the prefatory remark, \"That may be\r\ngood law in Sullivan County but it won't go in Orange County.\" After\r\nJudge Groo had stood this as long as he thought he ought to, he\r\nremarked, \"I want you to understand that there are just as good\r\nlawyers in Sullivan County as in Orange County.\" \"Oh, yes,\" said\r\nMcQuoid, \"I know that, but they all stay there.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Groo himself enjoyed the sally and was himself very quick at a\r\nretort. Once upon a trial in Goshen in which he was opposed by Judge\r\nGeorge W. Greene, who at one time occupied a prominent place at the\r\nOrange County bar, subsequently living in New York, where he died,\r\nJudge Greene asked the jurors the usual question, whether any of them\r\nhad ever done any business with Judge Groo, saying that if so he\r\nwould excuse them, whereupon Judge Groo said. \"Are there any\r\ngentlemen in the box who have ever done any business with Judge\r\nGreene; if so I would like to have them remain.\"\r\n\r\nMr. McQuoid had a wonderful memory. He could entertain his friends by\r\nthe hour repeating passages from famous orations or works of poetry.\r\nHis memory treasured even a fugitive poem read once in a newspaper.\r\nI recall an instance of this. One day when I was driving back with\r\nhim in a buggy from Circleville, where we had tried a case against\r\neach other it was the local custom for the lawyers to drive out\r\ntogether for their justice's court trials, he repeated to me a poem\r\nhe had seen in a newspaper written by Prime, the well known Eastern\r\ntraveler, in memory of a young girl, Claude Brownrigg, who had died\r\nsoon after he had told her of his travels in Palestine, as they\r\nwalked the beach one night in the moonlight. I told Mr. McQuoid I\r\nwould like a copy of it. So as soon as he got back to Middletown he\r\nwrote it off for me. I have preserved it these thirty years and more.\r\nHere are some of the lines:\r\n\r\n               \"All this I wished as on the beach\r\n                Beside the sea I walked,\r\n                And to a young and white-robed girl,\r\n                As thus I wished I talked.\r\n                Talked of far travel, wanderings long,\r\n                And scenes in many lands,\r\n                And all the while the golden path\r\n                Led eastward from the sands.\r\n\r\n               \"And she has crossed the shining path,\r\n                The path where moonbeams quiver,\r\n                And she is in Jerusalem,\r\n                Forever, yes, forever.\"\r\n\r\nThat lines like these should be repeated by him in coming back from a\r\ncommonplace suit in justice's court shows how thirty-five years ago\r\nlawyers thought and talked of something besides law and politics,\r\nmoney and stock markets.\r\n\r\nThe name of the McQuoids should not be permitted to fade from the\r\nmemory of the passing generation. His brother, Charles C. McQuoid,\r\nwho died in 1866, attained even greater prominence at the bar. He\r\nenjoyed great personal popularity and his premature death at the age\r\nof thirty-six from typhoid fever, contracted at the home of a client,\r\nwhose will he had been asked to draw, removed from the bar one of its\r\nmost conspicuous figures. His popularity is shown by his success in\r\ndefeating judge Gedney for district attorney by a narrow majority in\r\n1859. He served as district attorney until 1862. Being succeeded by\r\nAbram S. Cassedy, who in 1865 was succeeded by J. Hallock Drake,\r\nanother brilliant member of the Orange County bar who practiced in\r\nNewburgh for some years but who subsequently settled in New York.\r\n\r\nCharles G. Dill, now the Nestor of the Middletown bar, studied law\r\nwith Charles C. McQuoid, whose memory he holds in deep veneration.\r\nMr. Dill at one time enjoyed the largest practice in Middletown. It\r\nis only lately that he has relaxed his devotion to business, now\r\nspending several months each year in Florida, where he has extensive\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nMr. Dill is the very soul of honor and integrity in all the relations\r\nof life. The kindness of his heart is often obscured by the\r\nbrusqueness of his manner which sometimes gives strangers a wholly\r\nerroneous impression of a disposition singularly generous, open and\r\nbuoyant. He is the precise opposite of the type represented by the\r\ntraditional cow that gives a good pail of milk and then kicks it\r\nover. Mr. Dill kicks over the pail first and then proceeds to fill it\r\nwith the milk of human kindness. He generally explains at the\r\nbeginning how impossible it is for him to do anything for you and\r\nends by doing more for you than you asked or expected.\r\n\r\nMr. Dill's miscellaneous library is the best in Orange County. He is\r\na born, inveterate, irreclaimable bibliophile. A week that passes by\r\nwithout his buying some old, rare or scarce volume is to him a\r\nfailure. The question of price is never considered. If he wants it he\r\ngets it and that is all there is of it. He has built several\r\nadditions to his home to accommodate his treasures, but they\r\nconstantly overtax its capacity. They overflow and regurgitate in a\r\nconfusion that drives to despair the order fiend and the dust hunter.\r\n\r\nRosslyn M. Cox, who was for many years the partner of Mr. Dill and\r\nwho recently has entered into partnership with Mr. Watts, is one of\r\nthe most successful lawyers in Middletown. He is an expert in\r\naccountings before the surrogate and before the bankruptcy courts,\r\nbut he is equally at home in a trial or in an argument before the\r\ncourt. The esteem in which he is held is shown by his nomination in\r\n1906 for the office of county judge.\r\n\r\nAssociated with Mr. Cox is Elmer N. Oakes, whose abilities in the\r\npreparation of a case for trial are unique and remarkable. He is a\r\nnatural mechanic, understanding with ease the most difficult\r\nadjustments, functions and forms of complicated machinery. The\r\nknowledge displayed by him in respect to the construction and\r\noperation of a locomotive boiler was an important element in the\r\nsuccess of several actions growing out of an explosion.\r\n\r\nAfter preparing the case for trial Mr. Oakes is entirely competent to\r\ntry it. He has often examined and cross examined the witnesses but\r\ndistrusts his own powers when it comes to summing up the case to the\r\njury. When his modesty shall be replaced by greater assurance he will\r\nbe better known for his really solid attainments and fine abilities.\r\n\r\nAbram F. Servin will probably never overcome his timidity at the\r\nsound of his own voice in the presence of a jury, though he can\r\nfurnish enough law to other lawyers to keep them busy expounding it\r\nto the courts. He has argued and won cases in the Court of Appeals\r\nbut his chief victories are carried off by other lawyers who argue\r\nfrom the learned and exhaustive briefs prepared by him. He is an\r\nexpert in the preparation of a brief for the appellate courts. He\r\ncan take the printed record of a case of which he never heard and\r\nconstruct from it a perfectly convincing brief upon either side.\r\n\r\nAllen W. Corwin, who occupies the position of recorder of Middletown,\r\nhas displayed in the performance of his duties firmness tempered by\r\nforbearance, judgment informed by conscience, justice controlled by\r\nwisdom. His broad and humane policy in dealing with minor offenses,\r\nunited to his stern and rigid enforcement of the law in serious\r\ncases, largely accounts for the almost entire freedom of Middletown\r\nfrom crimes of pillage and violence.\r\n\r\nRecorder William H. Hyndman, of Newburgh, has also succeeded during\r\nthe last few years in greatly reducing the number of crimes committed\r\nin and about a city which was at one time infested by bold and\r\ndesperate criminals. A river town is always subject to greater\r\ndanger, through its opportunities for access and escape, but Recorder\r\nHyndman has earned the gratitude of the public for an administration\r\nof the criminal law which has resulted in a marked improvement of the\r\nconditions once prevalent in his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nOf course the discouragement of crime rests largely in the vigilance\r\nof the district attorney of the county. Thomas C. Rogers, of\r\nMiddletown, the son of William H. Rogers, who himself could easily\r\nhave attained eminence at the bar if he had so chosen, was elected to\r\nthis office in 1906. He has already shown that in his hands the wise,\r\nfaithful and efficient enforcement of the criminal law may be\r\nconfidently depended upon. His previous administration for three\r\nyears of the office of assistant district attorney was distinguished\r\nfor unusual ability. He is amply qualified to uphold the traditions\r\nof an office always ably filled by such men as Fullerton and Carr,\r\nBrown and Hirschberg, Anthony and Headley, Powelson and Seeger.\r\n\r\nJ. D. Wilson, Jr., of Newburgh, who received the appointment as\r\nassistant district attorney, to serve with Mr. Rogers, is well\r\nqualified to sustain the burdens of the position, which are\r\nnecessarily very considerable when it is considered that he is\r\nexpected to exercise special vigilance in the entire eastern part of\r\nthe county, including Newburgh itself.\r\n\r\nWickham T. Shaw was one of the most alert assistant district\r\nattorneys that Orange County ever had. He served in that capacity\r\nunder Judge Fullerton from 1868 to 1871, trying many of the cases.\r\nHis career at the bar of Middletown has afforded many opportunities\r\nfor the display of his knowledge of the criminal law, gained in that\r\nassociation with one of the foremost lawyers of his time.\r\n\r\nAbram V. N. Powelson never satisfied the expectations of his friends\r\nuntil he came to the office of district attorney in 1897, a position\r\nwhich he filled for seven years. They always knew that he had ability\r\nand they always regretted that his retention of the office of justice\r\nof the peace, for many years, prevented that recognition of his\r\nabilities to which they were entitled. But the opportunity to show\r\nhis solid worth both as a lawyer and as a law officer came with his\r\nentrance into a wider field of county administration in which he\r\nacquitted himself with credit and distinction.\r\n\r\nJohn F. Bradner, of Middletown, was also at one time closely\r\nconnected with the administration of the criminal law, having been\r\nthe recorder of Middletown for many years; a position in which he\r\npresided with great dignity over many important and exciting trials.\r\nMr. Bradner is an advocate who enters upon a trial with all the\r\nardor and enthusiasm born of absolute conviction in the justice of\r\nhis cause, and he never fails to make a strong impression upon a\r\njury.\r\n\r\nJohn L. Wiggins, of Middletown, son-in-law of Judge Groo and brother\r\nof Willis H. Wiggins, an eminent member of the Ohio judiciary, is\r\ndistinguished for the earnestness, energy and enthusiasm with which\r\nhe espouses every cause committed to him. He is original and\r\nresourceful. In an action brought once against his client for a\r\nviolation of the law in respect of adulterated milk, Mr. Wiggins\r\ngravely argued to the jury that in his judgment the law was\r\nunconstitutional. As the facts were clearly against his client, the\r\njudge did not take the trouble to interrupt him, but was astonished\r\nwhen the jury rendered a verdict in favor of Mr. Wiggins' client,\r\nbased wholly upon the constitutional argument.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mr. O'Neill, encouraged by Mr. Wiggins' tactics, entered\r\nupon the same line of defense, but Judge Gaynor admonished by the\r\nmiscarriage of the day before, promptly suppressed it, and Mr.\r\nO'Neill's client was convicted.\r\n\r\nAlton J. Vail, of Middletown, is a lawyer whose modesty often\r\nconceals his merits, which, however, are well known to his clients.\r\nMr. Vail has for many years transacted the business of the Middletown\r\nSavings Bank. He is an authority upon titles and upon all questions\r\ninvolving the law of real estate, his opinion upon these and kindred\r\nquestions having frequently been sustained by the courts. Wide\r\nexperience, sound judgment, conservative instincts, elevated\r\ncharacter, absolute probity and intense loyalty in friendship unite\r\nin Alton J. Vail, the able lawyer, the honorable man, the upright\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nA. C. N. Thompson, of Middletown, who is in partnership with Mr.\r\nDill, has abundant inspiration in his name. He is the son of John A.\r\nThompson, once a prominent lawyer of Monticello who, on account of\r\nhis admiration for one of the greatest lawyers of his day named him\r\nafter Archibald C. Niven.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson has already shown one quality conspicuous in his\r\ndistinguished godfather--that of capacity for hard work. His energy\r\nand self-denial in preparing himself for the bar while engaged in the\r\nexacting duties of another calling, give promise of abundant success\r\nin the career now opening before him.\r\n\r\nCharles T. Vail, who entered upon a career of high promise at the\r\nbar was cut down upon its threshold. No lawyer in Middletown ever had\r\nthe faculty of winning friends as easily as he. His sunny\r\ndisposition, affectionate nature and engaging manners won for him a\r\nhost of admirers, adherents and clients. Undimmed affection in many\r\nhearts still sheds a tear over the untimely grave of Charlie Vail.\r\n\r\nDewitt Van Zandt, of the Middletown bar, was the son of that gifted\r\ndivine, Dr. Van Zandt, so long the beloved pastor of the brick church\r\nat Montgomery. Coming to Middletown fresh from college, his sparkling\r\nwit and ready repartee endeared him to a large circle of admiring\r\nfriends. But soon he was overtaken by broken health, which paralyzed\r\nhis energies and crumbled his ambitions. Through all the experiences\r\nof a life that failed to fulfill its early promise, he maintained the\r\ninstincts, the manners and the bearing of the true gentleman. He\r\nnever lost the sweetness, serenity and gentleness of his disposition,\r\nor the high standard of personal honor inherited from his revered\r\nfather. Fond meditation still tenderly dwells upon the fadeless\r\nmemory of DeWitt Van Zandt.\r\n\r\nJohn G. Mills, of the Goshen bar, removed to Washington, where he\r\ndied in April, 1883. While necessity chained him to the law\r\ninclination led him along the flowery paths of literature, his\r\ntalents and accomplishments brought him into relations with the great\r\nand the gifted, one of his dearest friends being Robert G. Ingersoll,\r\nwho pronounced the oration at his funeral. Mr. Ingersoll said:\r\n\r\n\"My friends: Again we are face to face with the great mystery that\r\nshrouds the world. We question, but there is no reply. Out on the\r\nwide waste seas there drifts no spar. Over the desert of death the\r\nsphinx gazes forever, but never speaks.\r\n\r\n\"In the very May of life another heart has ceased to beat. Night has\r\nfallen upon noon. But he lived, he loved, he was loved. Wife and\r\nchildren pressed their kisses on his lips. This is enough. The\r\nlongest life contains no more. This fills the vase of joy.\r\n\r\n\"He who lies here, clothed with the perfect peace of death, was a\r\nkind and loving husband, a good father, a generous neighbor, an\r\nhonest man,--and these words build a monument of glory above the\r\nhumblest grave. He was always a child, sincere and frank, as full of\r\nhope as spring. He divided all time into to-day and to-morrow.\r\nTo-morrow was without a cloud and of to-morrow he borrowed sunshine\r\nfor to-day. He was my friend. He will remain so. The living oft\r\nbecome estranged; the dead are true. . . .\r\n\r\n\"With him immortality was the eternal consequences of his own acts.\r\nHe believed that every pure thought, every disinterested deed,\r\nhastens the harvest of universal good. This is a religion that\r\nenriches poverty; that enables us to bear the sorrows of the saddest\r\nlife; that peoples even solitude with happy millions yet to live,--a\r\nreligion born not of selfishness and fear, but of love, of gratitude\r\nand hope,--a religion that digs wells to slake the thirst of others,\r\nand gladly bears the burdens of the unborn.\r\n\r\n\"But in the presence of death how beliefs and dogmas wither and\r\ndecay! How loving words and deeds burst into blossom! Pluck from the\r\ntree of any life these flowers, and there remain but the barren\r\nthorns of bigotry and creed.\r\n\r\n\"All wish for happiness beyond this life. All hope to meet again the\r\nloved and lost. In every heart there grows this sacred flower.\r\nImmortality is a word that Hope through all the ages has been\r\nwhispering to Love. The miracle of thought we cannot comprehend. The\r\nmystery of life and death we cannot comprehend. This chaos called the\r\nworld has never been explained. The golden bridge of life from gloom\r\nemerges and on shadow rests. Beyond this we do not know. Fate is\r\nspeechless, destiny is dumb, and the secret of the future has never\r\nyet been told. We love; we wait; we hope. The more we love, the more\r\nwe fear. Upon the tenderest heart the deepest shadows fall. All\r\npaths, whether filled with thorns or flowers, end here. Here success\r\nand failure are the same. The rag of wretchedness and the purple robe\r\nof power all difference and distinction lose in the democracy of\r\ndeath. Character survives; goodness lives; love is immortal.\"\r\n\r\nHarrison W. Nanny, of Goshen, had a pathetic career. Possessed of\r\nunusual talent and capacity he was handicapped in the practice of his\r\nprofession by an accident which paralyzed his energies, embittered\r\nhis solitary life and pressed to his rebellious lips the chalice of\r\nmocking irony.\r\n\r\nBut while he was not resigned he was courageous. Some of the work\r\nwhich he performed in suffering and illness is marked by a high\r\ndegree of intellectual power. Only his misfortunes prevented his\r\nattaining prominence at the bar.\r\n\r\nNo one has a deeper affection for the memory of Mr. Nanny than his\r\nold friend and partner, Charles L. Mead, who now lives in retirement\r\nfrom the activities of his profession at his home in Middletown. Mr.\r\nMead has the unprecedented record of having served three terms in\r\nsuccession as county treasurer--a striking proof of his influence,\r\nhis popularity and his qualifications for public office. During his\r\nentire period of service not one of his political acts was ever\r\nquestioned and he surrendered the office crowned with the respect and\r\nconfidence of the public.\r\n\r\nBradford R. Champion, of the Goshen bar, was a contemporary of\r\nWinfield and Gedney. While his talents were not brilliant or showy he\r\nstill possessed those solid, sterling qualities of mind and heart\r\nwhich impart strength and vigor to individual character; which\r\ninspire confidence in the community at large; which uphold the very\r\nstructure of society; which confer blessings upon every relation in\r\nlife and which bring peace and honor, repose and happiness to their\r\npossessor.\r\n\r\nThe recent death of William H. Wyker removed one who, while not\r\nprominent in the trial courts, possessed many endearing traits of\r\ncharacter and occupied a large place in the social and civil life of\r\nGoshen. He was also in great favor and request as a speaker in\r\npolitical campaigns. He could have taken his place among the trial\r\nlawyers of the county, had he so chosen, but, he, too, suffered under\r\nthe disadvantage of having accepted the office of justice of the\r\npeace--that abyss in which talent has so often found its unmarked\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nThe late Benjamin F. Low, of the Middletown bar, was one of the most\r\ngenial spirits ever drawn into social relations with his fellow-men.\r\nHe fairly oozed companionship and good fellowship. He was also a good\r\nlawyer, coming from a family of which Senator Henry A. Low, his\r\nbrother, was the most able and conspicuous member.\r\n\r\nHe had some notable successes at the bar. In the case of Josie Teets\r\nagainst the city of Middletown he obtained a verdict for considerably\r\nmore than he would have got if it had not been for the mistake of his\r\nopponent in the cross-examination of the plaintiff's physician. Dr.\r\nWilliam H. Dorrance, who, on the direct, had testified to only\r\nmoderate injuries to his patient as the result of her being thrown\r\nover the dashboard on account of an obstruction in the street. But he\r\nbecame nettled by the cross-examination and when he was finally\r\nasked: \"Now, doctor, tell me just what is the matter with this young\r\nlady,\" he replied: \"Why, Mr. O'Neill, there is not one organ or\r\nfunction of that woman's body that works healthfully or naturally.\"\r\n\r\nThis brought up the verdict from $1,000, all that Mr. Low expected to\r\nget, to $3,000. It was a lesson to all who heard it as to the danger\r\nof giving a hostile witness too good an opening. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe woman is still living in vigorous health.\r\n\r\nLouis S. Sterrit, of Newburgh, who died in April, 1907, left a void\r\nin the hearts of a large and intimate circle. He enjoyed an extensive\r\nclientage and the confidence of the entire community. He was the\r\nattorney of that old, strong and conservative institution, the\r\nNewburgh Savings Bank, and of many other institutions and societies.\r\nHis dignified presence, his affable manners, his substantial worth,\r\nhis sincerely religious character, his mental poise combined to\r\nproduce an impression upon the community which the corrosion of time\r\nwill, with difficulty, efface.\r\n\r\nMr. Sterrit was eminently public-spirited. In 1904 he erected at the\r\nentrance of Woodlawn Cemetery, New Windsor, two very fine gates. He\r\nalso placed in the Union Presbyterian church of Newburgh a tablet in\r\nmemory of the late Rev. Alexander B. Jack, one of its pastors.\r\n\r\nHis generosity was unbounded. No client, however poor or humble,\r\never failed of help or counsel because he lacked a fee.\r\n\r\nThe death in 1906 of Lewis W. Y. McCroskery, of the Newburgh bar,\r\ncreated a general feeling of sorrow and a distinct sense of personal\r\nloss. He had filled many offices which brought him into individual\r\nrelations with the entire community, and it is safe to assert that he\r\nhad not a single enemy. His appointment as postmaster by President\r\nCleveland was filled with credit to himself and usefulness to the\r\npublic service. His professional career was interrupted by this\r\nservice, but when he resumed his practice at the expiration of his\r\nterm his clients gathered about him again, for they and the bar alike\r\nalways appreciated deeply his amiable disposition, his spotless\r\ncharacter, his solid ability.\r\n\r\nJoseph M. Leeper, of the Newburgh bar, also passed away in 1906. A\r\nveteran of the Civil War his health did not permit him to engage in\r\nactive practice, but he took an honorable pride in his membership of\r\na profession which he never did one act to discredit.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Mr. Leeper suggests the name of one who should not be\r\nsuffered to fall into oblivion, for it was one of the strongest\r\npassions of his own life to perpetuate the memory of the leaders of\r\nthe Orange County bar, by which he was especially deputed to prepare\r\nand publish the memorial to Mr. Winfield. No one will dissent from a\r\npassing tribute to the generous instincts and throbbing heart of\r\nJohn K. Goldsmith.\r\n\r\nHenry W. Chadeayne, elected in 1906 supervisor of the town of\r\nCornwall, but practicing in Newburgh, stands out as one of the few\r\nmen who always says what he thinks. You can always tell where to find\r\nhim, and that is just where he says he is. You do not have to go to\r\nany one else to learn where he stands. Just ask him and you will\r\nknow. He has no patience with trimmers and time-servers. He always\r\ntakes the most straight road possible to any given end.\r\n\r\nThis rugged intellectual honesty constitutes a positive force and a\r\nsterling asset. The public service and the legal profession have no\r\npurer representative than Henry W. Chadeayne.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of the Newburgh bar who have risen rapidly to\r\nprominence is James G. Graham, the son of the gifted lawyer already\r\nreferred to, whose full name he bears. Mr. Graham, after four years'\r\nexperience in public affairs at Albany, in the executive chamber,\r\naccepted the office of deputy attorney-general, which he held two\r\nyears. This position, which has always been a most exacting one,\r\ninvolving the trial and argument of cases of great magnitude, was\r\nfilled by Mr. Graham with marked ability and to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of the public. It was during his incumbency of this\r\nposition that Mr. Graham was chiefly instrumental in bringing about\r\nthe creation of the new ninth judicial district--a service for which\r\nthe Orange County bar can never be sufficiently grateful to him. It\r\nis to his untiring and influential exertions that we are chiefly\r\nindebted for the creation of a natural, homogeneous judicial\r\ndistrict, free from the blight and incubus of Kings County--a\r\ndistrict in which the accession to the bench of Judges Mills,\r\nTompkins and Morschauser insures the preservation of those standards\r\nof judicial dignity, decorum, deliberation and, above all,\r\nconsideration for the rights and feelings of the bar, which have been\r\nso nobly maintained by their distinguished colleague, Judge Keogh.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh bar has many members of varying degrees of prominence\r\nand experience, including the venerable Jesse F. Shafer, who was born\r\nin 1828; Samuel E. Dimmick, who comes from a family of able lawyers;\r\nSeward U. Round, who worthily bears the famous name bestowed upon him\r\nat the time his father was principal of the Seward Institute at\r\nFlorida; Caleb H. Baumes, who is idolized by his brethren of the Odd\r\nFellows; Peter Cantline, aggressive, ambitious and rising, destined\r\nto take his place among the foremost members of the Orange County\r\nbar; James M. H. Wallace, earnest, forcible, unflinching,\r\nindefatigable and intellectual; Charles W. U. Sneed, modest,\r\ninteresting and well informed; David C. Scott, patient, devoted and\r\nindustrious; Leroy Dickerson, engaging and efficient; John B. Corwin,\r\nthe fit successor of Louis S. Sterrit as attorney for the Newburgh\r\nSavings Bank and, like him, retiring and reserved until the occasion\r\ncalls for action, when he is eloquent, convincing and powerful; Frank\r\nW. Tompkins, popular and respected; George W. May, refined and\r\ngentlemanly; Martin G. Mould, courteous and affable; W. J. Wygant,\r\nunassuming and competent; Reeve Ketcham, faithful and energetic;\r\nReuben H. Hilton, U. S. Collector of the Port of Newburgh; Russell S.\r\nCoutant, accomplished and scholarly; Nehemiah Fowler, solid and\r\ndignified; A. D. and A. W. Lent, father and son, educated, amiable\r\nand conscientious.\r\n\r\nThe Walden bar is adorned by the ardent, impulsive, enthusiastic,\r\nbrilliant A. S. Embler; by the earnest, thoughtful, learned Irving H.\r\nLoughran; by the bustling, energetic, ambitious Anson J. Fowler, and\r\nby the fine natural abilities of Caleb B. Birch, Jr.\r\n\r\nJoseph M. Wilkin, of the Montgomery bar, bears an honored name--that\r\nof his father, who for several years occupied a prominent position at\r\nthe bar of Tennessee, returning to Orange County at the opening of\r\nthe war on account of his pronounced Union sentiments. He was the\r\nbrother of Judge John G. Wilkin, already referred to, and the two had\r\nmany traits of character in common derived from their sterling\r\nancestry. It is not strange that the younger Joseph M. Wilkin should\r\nexhibit in his present administration of the duties of special\r\nsurrogate the qualities which have always distinguished the members\r\nof his famous and honorable family.\r\n\r\nThe bar of Montgomery is also strengthened by the high character and\r\nunquestioned capacity of William L. Dickerson. But Montgomery has\r\nceased to be the center of legal interest which it was in the days\r\nwhen Edward Van Orsdall organized a suit there at least once a week\r\nand where he and that once well known member of the Goshen bar,\r\nGeorge W. Millspaugh, frequently tried out the issues before a jury\r\npacked to beat one or the other.\r\n\r\nThe Middletown bar includes, among its well known members, Henry T.\r\nCrist, whose personal popularity led to his election as coroner;\r\nRussell M. Vernon, who has acquired a large practice in the\r\nSurrogate's Court; Howard M. Starr, who is performing the duties of\r\njustice of the peace; John Bright, whose alertness, readiness and\r\ngeneral information predestines him to an active career; Jeremiah E.\r\nBarnes, who served most acceptably for several years as the recorder\r\nof the city of Middletown; and Charles C. Elston, who has manfully\r\novercome many difficulties in establishing and maintaining his\r\nposition at the bar.\r\n\r\nThe Goshen bar includes among its honored members Charles W. Coleman,\r\nwho notwithstanding that he is a martyr to ill health and is\r\ncompelled to spend the winters in Florida, retains the confidence and\r\nbusiness of a host of personal friends; also William D. Mills, who\r\nhas learning enough to equip a dozen lawyers for successful practice.\r\n\r\nLouis Bedell, of the Goshen bar, secured at Albany in the Assembly a\r\nmore powerful personal influence than any member from his district\r\never enjoyed, with the exception of his former partner, George W.\r\nGreene. This was, of course, partly due to the wisdom of the\r\nelectors in keeping him there. But Mr. Bedell's many qualifications\r\nfor success in public life accounted in a large degree for the extent\r\nof his influence. A lawyer is always needed in either the Assembly or\r\nthe Senate and no amount of good fellowship or general intelligence\r\ncan make up for the lack of legal training and experience.\r\n\r\nJoseph Merritt, of Goshen, whose diffidence prevents his coming into\r\nprominence before the public is, however, unable to conceal from his\r\nprofessional brethren his very superior legal attainments. He is a\r\nlawyer of the very first rank. His opinion is respected and followed\r\nin many instances in which the court is unaware that it is he who has\r\nguided it to a correct conclusion.\r\n\r\nPhilip A. Rorty, of the Goshen bar, has gone rapidly to the front.\r\nThe wide experience gained by him in the extensive business\r\nestablished by the firm of Bacon & Merritt, in which he is a partner,\r\nhas been used by him to great advantage. He is entrusted with the\r\npreparation of important cases, in the trial of which also he takes a\r\nconsiderable and highly creditable part. He is an expert in railroad\r\nlaw and in the law of negligence.\r\n\r\nT. Floyd Halstead, of Goshen, is the son of one of the most\r\nwarmhearted, noble, honorable men who ever lived--the late John R.\r\nHalstead of Unionville. If he will but emulate in private and\r\nprofessional life the virtues of his most estimable father he will be\r\nsure to continue and confirm the success which has already in a large\r\nmeasure attended upon him.\r\n\r\nJ. V. D. Benedict, of Warwick, represented his district in the\r\nAssembly in the year 1877. His suavity of manner and moderation of\r\nspeech are the sincere reflection of a kind, generous and\r\naffectionate nature.\r\n\r\nHis interest in various pursuits has interfered with the singleness\r\nof his devotion to the law, but his opinion upon difficult questions\r\nhas often been sought and followed with the most satisfactory results\r\nto himself and to his clients.\r\n\r\nClifford S. Beattie, of Warwick, who is associated in business with\r\nhis father, Judge Beattie, settled in his old home after a most valuable\r\nand enlightening experience as one of the legal staff of the\r\nMetropolitan Railway system in New York. He possesses an\r\nindividuality, an independence and a strength of character which\r\nprevent his being overshadowed by the great reputation of his father.\r\nBut if he did not have these qualities he would not be a Beattie.\r\n\r\nLewis J. Stage, of Warwick, who is associated in business with Mr.\r\nKane, under the name of Kane & Stage, had the good sense to\r\nvoluntarily resign the office of justice of the peace--that grave of\r\nprofessional ambition; that rock upon which so many a professional\r\ncareer has foundered. Since then he has made strides in reputation\r\nand influence.\r\n\r\nMr. Stage has always taken an active part in the educational,\r\nphilanthropic, historical and religious interests of the community.\r\nHis sincerity in this is manifest and unquestioned. He is free from\r\nall forms of cant and pretense, sham and affectation.\r\n\r\nJohn Miller, of Cornwall-on-Hudson, whose memory goes back to the\r\ndays of McKissock, is a veritable encyclopedia of the law; a\r\nstorehouse of principles and authorities; a reservoir of unlimited\r\ncapacity; a fountain of perennial flow. If he had been as able to\r\napply, discriminate and assimilate as he has been to accumulate\r\nstores of knowledge his abilities would undoubtedly have been more\r\nwidely recognized.\r\n\r\nThomas S. Hulse, of Westtown, has long enjoyed the advantage of being\r\nthe only lawyer in town. He is often consulted upon the\r\ncontroversies arising in it and his influence is always for peace\r\nrather than strife, for settlement rather than litigation. His solid\r\nworth of character commands for him universal and unchallenged\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nFrank R. Gump, of Highland Falls, signalized his entrance into\r\npractice at the Orange County Bar by bringing the unusual action of a\r\nman against a woman for her breach of promise in refusing to marry\r\nhim. He has been the attorney for some most important interests\r\ninvolved in actions brought to determine priority of water rights.\r\nThe ability shown by him in the management of these cases and\r\nespecially in the examination and cross-examination of the witnesses\r\nin several trials has given him a recognized position at the bar of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\nFrank Lybolt, of Port Jervis, who filled most competently a term of\r\noffice as special county judge, has tried some cases in the Supreme\r\nCourt with an intelligence, earnestness and spirit which attracted\r\nthe attention of his professional brethren.\r\n\r\nWilton Bennet, of Port Jervis, has given special attention to the\r\ntrial of criminal cases in which his zeal, earnestness, boldness and\r\neloquence have given to him many professional victories and to his\r\nclients many occasions for profound and lasting gratitude.\r\n\r\nWilliam P. Gregg, of the Port Jervis bar, has, by his straightforward\r\nand manly character, impressed himself most favorably upon the\r\ncommunity, this ability as a lawyer received deserved recognition in\r\nJanuary, 1907, when he was appointed the tax appraiser of Orange\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nHenry B. Fullerton, of Port Jervis, greatly resembles in character\r\nand ability his relative, Daniel Fullerton, who, though he did not\r\nattain the eminence of his brothers, William and Stephen W.\r\nFullerton, possessed more original gifts and natural eloquence than\r\neither of them.\r\n\r\nThe Port Jervis bar is also enriched by the fine character and\r\nsterling abilities of Alfred Marvin and R. Edward Schofield.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Parshall, of Port Jervis, who was at one time associated\r\nwith Mr. Carr in the protection of the interests of the Erie Railroad\r\nCompany, has won the respect of the community and of his professional\r\nbrethren by the high-minded, honorable, sincere and manly course\r\nwhich he has always pursued in every walk of life, private, public\r\nand professional.\r\n\r\nHis splendid vote in the autumn of 1907 for the office of surrogate\r\nattests the popular esteem in which he is held.\r\n\r\nJohn B. Swezey, his successful competitor, entered upon the duties of\r\nthe office of surrogate in January, 1908.\r\n\r\nHe was for many years the attorney for the Middletown State Hospital\r\nand he has occupied many other positions of responsibility, the\r\nduties of which he has always discharged with fidelity and ability.\r\nHis service as special surrogate brought the bar of the county into\r\nclose acquaintance with his superior judicial qualifications and\r\nprepared it to expect his elevation to still higher judicial station.\r\n\r\nOrange County has always been fortunate in its surrogates and the\r\nfriends of Judge Swezey confidently expect him to maintain unsullied\r\nthe traditions and the standards set by such predecessors as Scott\r\nand Coleman, Wadsworth and Howell.\r\n\r\nObadiah P. Howell retired from the office of surrogate on the first\r\nof January, 1908, after an incumbency of twelve years, with the\r\nprofound respect of the bar and of the public for both his character\r\nand his attainments. Judge Howell possesses an evenly balanced, well\r\npoised character which admirably fitted him for the duties of this\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nHis abilities as a lawyer were also brought into constant requisition\r\nduring his terms of office on account of the many new questions which\r\narose under the operation of the transfer tax statutes. These\r\nquestions were disposed of by him with rigid impartiality, zealous\r\nregard for every interest represented, and deep anxiety to arrive at\r\na just and sound conclusion. His careful discrimination in applying\r\nthe principles of law involved has resulted in a body of decisions\r\nwhich command the respect of both the bar and the judiciary.\r\n\r\nJudge Howell was always most conservative. Such was his veneration\r\nfor the last wishes of a dying testator that if he ever felt it his\r\nduty to set aside a will, the fact is not generally known. He gave no\r\nencouragement to those frivolous and often merely speculative or\r\nintimidating contests which have done so much to bring probate\r\nadministration into reproach in many jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nJudge Howell always exhibited one characteristic which commands\r\nspecial commendation. He never tolerated the merely perfunctory\r\nperformance of their duties by guardians appointed to represent the\r\ninterests of minors or incompetents. He exacted the most careful\r\ninvestigation of their rights to the end that they should be fully\r\nprotected and he so exercised his authority in making appointments as\r\nto insure this result. His administration will go down to history as\r\none of the purest and ablest in the annals of the county.\r\n\r\nRoswell C. Coleman, who preceded Judge Howell in the office of\r\nsurrogate, occupying it for twelve years (1883-1895), entered upon\r\nhis duties with peculiar qualifications for their successful\r\ndischarge. His professional bent had always been in the direction of\r\npractice in the Surrogate's Court and of interest in all the\r\nquestions arising in the construction of wills. Moreover he began his\r\npractice with the senior Joseph W. Gott, an association from which he\r\ncould not fail to derive benefit as well as pleasure.\r\n\r\nHis eminently judicial temperament was early recognized by the judges\r\nand by his associates with the result that, in the days when\r\nreferences were far more common than they are now, owing to the\r\ninadequacy of the judicial force and the necessity for auxiliary\r\nrequisitions upon the profession, Mr. Coleman was constantly\r\ndesignated by the court and by consent of counsel to serve in\r\nimportant references. His absolute fairness, his love of justice, his\r\nfreedom from influence and his unerring judgment made him the\r\nfavorite referee in the county during that entire period of\r\nimperfect judicial service which was supplemented in him by an\r\nability fully equal to that of the judge appointing him. I remember\r\nan occasion when judge Barnard, in announcing the selection of Mr.\r\nColeman as referee, remarked to the attorney, \"Don't let him get\r\nafter you with his gun,\" referring to his well-known experience in\r\n1875 as a member of the first American rifle team that ever went\r\nabroad, Mr. Coleman returning with several prizes for his skillful\r\nmarksmanship.\r\n\r\nMr. Coleman's tenure of the office of surrogate was distinguished for\r\nthe display of those high judicial qualities with which the entire\r\nbar had become acquainted in his frequent exercise of them as\r\nreferee. Indeed, so great was the respect in which they were held\r\nthat in many contests involving large interests, the parties\r\nacquiesced in his decision as final, the defeated party taking no\r\nappeal. This was notably the case in the matter of the will of John\r\nS. Sammons, in which all his property was given to a church upon the\r\ncondition that it should care perpetually for his tomb. The church\r\ntook no appeal from the decision of Surrogate Coleman refusing to\r\nadmit the will to probate. The opinion of the surrogate is a masterly\r\nreview of the law of insane delusions as affecting testamentary\r\ncapacity, pointing out that a will may often be upheld notwithstanding\r\nthe presence of insane delusions when those delusions do not tend to\r\nproduce the will. But in this case the will was rejected because the\r\ndelusion under which the testator labored did govern him in the\r\ndisposition of his property, he having formed the delusion that his\r\nbody was to be preserved to the end of time and having given his\r\nproperty to the church to secure the protection of his tomb from\r\ndisturbance. The opinion contains a very subtle, acute and interesting\r\ndiscussion of other delusions cherished by the testator which would\r\nnot in themselves have invalidated the will, but which are considered\r\nas bearing upon the liability of the testator to form a delusion by\r\nwhich he was controlled in the disposition of his property.\r\n\r\nAlthough the case attracted great attention, the opinion of the\r\nsurrogate never was reported. For this reason it is especially\r\nappropriate that a partial report of it should be preserved in this\r\nall too perishable record. The case constitutes, also, one of the\r\nnotable legal victories of Henry W. Wiggins, who appeared for the\r\ncontestants.\r\n\r\nMr. Coleman since his retirement from the bench has been honored with\r\nmany marks of continued confidence in his judicial qualifications.\r\nNo lawyer now living commands greater respect for the simplicity of\r\nhis life, the purity of his character, the force of his example, the\r\nvigor of his manhood, the solidity of his attainments and the\r\ngenuineness of his learning than does Roswell C. Coleman.\r\n\r\nHenry A. Wadsworth, who preceded Mr. Coleman in twelve years'\r\nincumbency of the office of surrogate, brought to its duties a large\r\nfund of practical knowledge, common sense and capacity for affairs.\r\nHis legal attainments were ample and he was deeply anxious in every\r\ncase to arrive at a sound and just decision. His place in the\r\naffections of the bar was accurately as well as touchingly set forth\r\nin the memorial address of Judge Hirschberg, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"The sweetness and gentleness of his nature, his genial and frank\r\nspirit, the generous impulses of his heart, and the broad and\r\nengaging charity of his views are known best to the favored few who\r\nrejoiced in his intimate companionship. His hand was open as the day\r\nto melting charity. His dealings were ever plain, straightforward and\r\ndirect. He despised all shams and affectations. To his friends he was\r\nthe very soul of unselfish loyalty, and to the party which honored\r\nboth him and itself in his elevation, and in whose counsels he was\r\never a trusted leader, he rendered always a manly and unfaltering\r\nallegiance. A loving husband, an affectionate and indulgent father, a\r\nwise, honest and safe adviser, an unstained lawyer, an incorruptible\r\njudge, and a loyal friend are buried in his grave. And if amid the\r\ngood of his great nature there was mingled any blemish or alloy of\r\nhuman fault or folly, let us to whom his name is now but a sweet and\r\ntender memory:\r\n\r\n          \"'No further seek his merits to disclose\r\n           Nor draw his frailties from their dread abode,\r\n           (There they alike in trembling hope repose)\r\n           The bosom of his Father and his God.'\"\r\n\r\nGilbert O. Hulse, who preceded Mr. Wadsworth in the office of\r\nsurrogate, still survives at the age of eighty-four to relate his\r\nreminiscences of the bench and bar of a previous generation. Before\r\ncoming to this office in 1868 he had enjoyed a large professional\r\nexperience which fully qualified him for his duties. He was engaged\r\nin many notable cases, in one of which, attracting great attention at\r\nthe time, he established a lost will many years after it had been\r\nwrongfully destroyed and secured the property till then denied to its\r\nrightful owners, his clients. Much of his professional life has been\r\npassed in the city of New York but he retains his residence in Orange\r\nCounty, in which he was born in 1824, and with which his ancestors\r\nhad been identified since 1775.\r\n\r\nThe early part of the last century was marked by the rise in Orange\r\nCounty of an able and progressive bar, whose courage and public\r\nspirit contributed to keep alive the fires of exalted patriotism.\r\nJonathan Fisk, who removed to Newburgh in 1800, became one of the\r\nmost influential citizens of the county, being elected twice to\r\ncongress and being appointed twice United States attorney for the\r\nSouthern District of New York.\r\n\r\nHenry G. Wisner, who was admitted in 1802, settled in Goshen in 1810,\r\nwhere for thirty years he stood forth as its most prominent citizen,\r\nits most active philanthropist and one of its foremost lawyers.\r\n\r\nWalter Case, who also was admitted in 1802, settled in Newburgh,\r\nserving in Congress and becoming the surrogate of the county in 1823\r\nfor a term of four years. His scholarly tastes and literary gifts\r\nstill find inherited expression through the cultured mind of his\r\ndescendant, Walter Case Anthony.\r\n\r\nDavid W. Bate and Thomas McKissock, who were associated under the\r\nname of Bate & McKissock, were strong and able men, exercising a wide\r\nand potent influence. Judge Bate was elected county judge in 1847.\r\nJudge McKissock was appointed supreme court judge to serve for a few\r\nmonths and was elected to Congress in 1849.\r\n\r\nWilliam C. Hasbrouck, who studied with Mr. Wisner, was admitted in\r\n1826 and began his practice in Newburgh. where he resided until his\r\ndeath. He was speaker of the Assembly in 1847 and attracted attention\r\nand admiration abroad as well as at home by a courtly presence and\r\ncharming address, united to robust manhood and sturdy principles. He\r\nenjoyed the personal friendship of many prominent men of every shade\r\nof opinion, including Sam Houston, Andrew Jackson and William H.\r\nSeward. He died in 1870.\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. Duryea filled a large place in the life of the county.\r\nAdmitted in 1839, he became surrogate in 1847 and county judge in\r\n1855. His opinion upon any state of facts submitted to him was\r\nregarded by his associates of the bar as conclusive upon the\r\nquestions of law involved. His son, Henry C. Duryea, whose career was\r\nmarred by precarious health, survived him until 1906.\r\n\r\nOf all the able lawyers who have kept bright the fame of the Goshen\r\nbar, perhaps no one ever exhibited greater force of character or made\r\na deeper impression upon his fellow citizens than Samuel J. Wilkin,\r\nwho was admitted to the bar in 1815 and who practiced in Goshen from\r\nthat time until his death in 1866. He served with distinction in\r\nCongress and in the Senate of the State. His fiery eloquence,\r\ncommanding presence and lofty character live in traditions that will\r\nlong preserve his name from indifference or his memory from neglect.\r\nHis daughter Sara became the wife of ex-Surrogate Roswell C. Coleman.\r\nHis father, General James W. Wilkin, was also a distinguished man,\r\nserving in the Senate, Assembly and Congress, and coming within one\r\nvote of being elected to the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nOliver Young rose to conspicuous influence and weight in Port Jervis\r\nsoon after his removal there in 1849. He lived during the period of\r\npolitical unrest which soon afterwards set in, and he was the\r\nforemost champion of anti-slavery principles in the county at a time\r\nwhen his sentiments were highly unpopular. He survived to see the\r\nonce decried abolitionists acclaimed by the arbitrament of war and\r\nthe verdict of history the most advanced statesmen of their century.\r\nHe died in 1871.\r\n\r\nThis brings our narrative to the point of time from which the direct\r\nconnection of the Orange County bar with the events of that stirring\r\nperiod and with the subsequent history of the county has been traced.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that, in the sixty years preceding the\r\npublication of Eager's History of Orange County in 1847, no less than\r\none hundred and seventy-five lawyers were admitted to practice in\r\nOrange County, their names appearing in the appendix to that volume;\r\nand that, in the sixty years now elapsed since its publication, fully\r\nas many more have been added to the number, it will readily be seen\r\nhow impossible it is to undertake, in one department of a general\r\ncounty history, a sketch of many, among the living and the dead,\r\nwhose estimable career it would be a pleasure to follow and depict.\r\nThe purpose of this review and the treatment of its themes are\r\nentirely different from the plan and method adopted in Ruttenber's\r\nHistory of Orange County published in 1881, to which the reader is\r\nreferred for such dates as may not be accessible here in respect to\r\nsome of the lawyers who nourished before that time; while to Eager's\r\nhistory is referred the reader who may seek simply the names of those\r\nwho were admitted to practice before 1847.\r\n\r\nThe bar of Orange County has also contributed to wider fields of\r\nactivity many who have reflected high honor upon the place of their\r\nprofessional nativity. One of these was Benjamin F. Dunning, who,\r\nwhen he was in practice in Goshen in 1853, was invited by the leader\r\nof the New York bar, Charles O'Conor, to become associated with him.\r\nThat veteran of the Orange County clerk's office, Charles G. Elliot,\r\nwho has seen three generations of lawyers come upon the scene, told\r\nme that he was in the clerk's office when Mr. Dunning received the\r\nletter from Mr. O'Conor containing this proposition and saw him show\r\nit to Nathan Westcott, then a leading lawyer of the county and once\r\nits district attorney, whose brilliant career was interrupted by\r\nparalysis resulting from a fall from a wagon. Mr. Westcott handed the\r\nletter back to Mr. Dunning with the remark that Mr. Dunning would\r\nnever live to receive a higher honor than this evidence of Mr.\r\nO'Conor's admiration and confidence. This confidence was abundantly\r\njustified in the long years of Mr. Dunning's association with Mr.\r\nO'Conor, which continued until Mr. O'Conor retired from practice.\r\n\r\nWilliam Fullerton also was invited by Charles O'Conor to New York,\r\nwhere he soon established a reputation as the most superb\r\ncross-examiner of his generation and as an advocate of remarkable\r\ngifts. He retained until his death his residence in Newburgh, where\r\nhe had originally been associated in practice with James W. Fowler,\r\nwhose honorable service as the surrogate of Orange County from 1851\r\nto 1855 is still remembered.\r\n\r\nJohn Duer, after several years of practice in Goshen, went in 1820\r\nto New York, where he became a justice of the Superior Court and the\r\nauthor of several Valuable textbooks. His fame is preserved in his\r\nwritings, though these give no conception of the effect of his noble\r\npresence and impassioned oratory.\r\n\r\nOf course, the reputation which towers above that of any man ever\r\nborn in Orange County is that of William H. Seward, who studied law\r\nin Goshen with John Duer and Ogden Hoffman. This is not because he\r\nwas a greater lawyer than either of his preceptors but because his\r\ncareer as a United States senator in the period of excitement before\r\nthe Civil War, his valuable services as Secretary of State in the\r\ncrisis of our national life and his farseeing statesmanship in\r\nacquiring the territory of Alaska, have written his name large upon\r\nthe roll of everlasting fame.\r\n\r\nOgden Hoffman, indeed, excelled him in all the attributes of a great\r\nlawyer. Admitted to the bar in 1818 and elected district attorney of\r\nOrange County in 1823, his transcendent abilities soon drew him to\r\nNew York, where he transfixed the wondering gaze of its brilliant\r\nbar, which welcomed into its firmament this star of first magnitude.\r\nBenjamin D. Silliman, one of its leaders, in an address made in 1889,\r\nthus refers to him: \"the fascinating Ogden Hoffman, the Erskine of\r\nour bar, at which he became powerful and eminent and captivated all\r\nby his art and his wonderful eloquence; his voice was music from the\r\nnote of a lute to the blast of a bugle.\" Luther R. Marsh, when\r\nopposed to him once upon a trial, sought to forestall the dreaded\r\neffect of the speech in which Hoffman was to follow by describing him\r\nas one who \"could rise upon the heaving exigencies of the moment, and\r\nat whose bidding instant creations and mighty embodying of thought\r\nand argument, sublime conceptions, glowing analogies and living\r\nimagery burst as by miracle from the deep of mind in overshadowing\r\nforms of majesty and power.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Clinton and his nephew, DeWitt Clinton, are claimed by Ulster\r\nCounty, because New Windsor, the town in which they were born was, at\r\nthe time, a part of Ulster County, it not having been set off to\r\nOrange County until 1799. But their fame has passed beyond the\r\ntrivial rivalries of county pride. It belongs to the State and to the\r\nNation. George Clinton died in 1812, vice-president of the United\r\nStates. DeWitt Clinton died in 1828, governor of the State of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nIn our own time, too. Orange County has contributed to the bar of the\r\nState many distinguished ornaments. The brilliant career of Lewis E.\r\nCarr, once its district attorney, but now a member of the Albany bar,\r\nhas already been outlined.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. McElroy is a member of the Orange County bar, now\r\nrepresenting it at Albany, of which the bar is particularly proud. In\r\nthe intervals of his official duties in the Transfer Tax Bureau he\r\nprepared a work upon the transfer tax law which affords abundant\r\nevidence of his industry, research and learning.\r\n\r\nMr. McElroy's service as special surrogate of the county at the time\r\nthat he resided in Warwick, was distinguished for some opinions which\r\nshowed his marked qualifications for judicial station. He wrote an\r\nopinion in a case involving the question whether the statute of\r\nlimitations runs in favor of an administrator, in which the doctrine\r\nmaintained by him was not generally accepted by the courts; but later\r\nthe courts adopted and enforced the view which he, at one time, was\r\nalmost alone in asserting.\r\n\r\nMr. McElroy is assured of a warm welcome from his brethren of the\r\nOrange County bar when he is ready to exchange the weary, dreary,\r\ndepressing treadmill of department officialism for the pleasant,\r\nrefreshing, verdured paths of general practice.\r\n\r\nJohn B. Kerr, of the Newburgh bar, is another lawyer of whom Orange\r\nCounty is indeed proud, though he has now been separated for some\r\nyears from its personal associations and activities, having accepted\r\nthe position of general counsel for the New York, Ontario & Western\r\nRailroad Company. In this responsible position he finds unusual\r\nopportunity to exercise and develop those qualities of sound\r\njudgment, rare foresight, steady poise and intellectual grasp in\r\nwhich he so excels and of which his early career at the bar gave\r\nabundant promise.\r\n\r\nThomas P. Fowler, whose home is in Warwick, and who was at one time a\r\nmember of the firm led by his distinguished father-in-law, Benjamin\r\nF. Dunning, has acquired a position in the railroad and financial\r\nworld which reconciles him to his withdrawal from the activities of\r\nhis profession. The masterly ability shown by him in making the New\r\nYork, Ontario & Western Railroad Company one of the most important\r\nand valuable railroad properties of the country has given him\r\nnational prominence and reputation.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Gardner, formerly of the Newburgh bar, settled in New York,\r\nwhere his chief reputation has been gained in actions against\r\ncorporations. He is a recognized authority in the law of negligence,\r\nhaving won many important cases and having edited for some years a\r\nseries of reports specially devoted to cases of negligence. Mr.\r\nGardner was born in Warwick, to which lovely spot he frequently\r\nreturns. His career in Newburgh was distinguished by the same\r\nqualities which have commanded success in a broader field. His fine\r\npresence, unfailing resources, entire self-possession, tireless\r\nenergy, dauntless courage and impressive delivery combine to make him\r\none of the most formidable trial lawyers of the State.\r\n\r\nAmos Van Etten, who began his practice in Port Jervis, removed to\r\nKingston, where he very soon established his title to recognition as\r\none of the leaders of the Ulster County bar, a position which he now\r\nholds by general acknowledgment of both the bar and the public.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Etten, as the attorney for the New York Central Railroad, and\r\nof other public service corporations, has been compelled to give his\r\nchief attention to railroad and negligence law, though he commands\r\nalso a wide general practice. His success has been emphatic,\r\npronounced and permanent.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Stoddard, formerly of the Middletown bar, has become a\r\nprominent member of the Buffalo bar. He is original, independent and\r\nentertaining in his addresses to juries, while his conversation is\r\nfull of wit, sally and anecdote.\r\n\r\nOne day there came to his office on old client whose wife had just\r\nleft him to take up her abode with another man. His client was in\r\ndeep dejection and wanted comfort. This is the way \"Stod\"--as he was\r\nfamiliarly called by his friends--gave it to him. He said: \"Cheer up,\r\nJohn, brace up; why, there are a dozen men in Middletown who would be\r\nglad to be in your shoes to-day.\"\r\n\r\nReferring once to the wife of a friend, who was known to be a\r\ntermagant, he said: \"She's the most even-tempered woman I ever\r\nknew--always mad.\"\r\n\r\nThis faculty of bold, rapid characterization has always prevented him\r\nfrom being dull either in his speeches or in social life. He is\r\nnothing if not interesting. His rare qualities of mind and heart\r\nendeared him to a large Orange County circle, which still\r\naffectionately remembers him.\r\n\r\nWilliam S. Bennett, formerly of the Port Jervis bar, removed to New\r\nYork, where his career has been one of uninterrupted prosperity and\r\npromotion. He is now representing his district in Congress, where he\r\nhas already achieved distinction in that most difficult of all places\r\nin which to compel immediate recognition.\r\n\r\nHis abilities have been so conspicuous and the esteem of his\r\ncolleagues has been so unmistakably manifested that the attention of\r\nthe entire country has been fixed upon this still cherished son of\r\nOrange County.\r\n\r\nNot only has Orange County sent forth many lawyers whose names have\r\nbecome famous throughout the world, but Orange County is the Mecca to\r\nwhich many of the country's ablest lawyers repair to spend their\r\ndeclining years, attracted by its beauty and invigorated by its\r\natmosphere. Benjamin F. Tracy, once secretary of the navy and long\r\none of the leading advocates of the bar of Brooklyn and New York, now\r\nspends much of his time upon his beloved farm near Goshen. General\r\nHenry L. Burnett, prominent in Ohio and New York, whose life of high\r\nadventure and brilliant achievement possesses all the interest of\r\nromance, also finds upon his Goshen estate the leisure in which to\r\ncharm a choice circle of friends old and new with reminiscences of\r\nthe famous men with whom he has been associated on equal terms and of\r\nthe stirring scenes in which he has so honorably and conspicuously\r\nmingled.\r\n\r\nOrange County, which has in days gone by attracted to itself the\r\nsensitive poet, Nathaniel P. Willis, the scholarly historian, Joel T.\r\nHeadley, the gifted lawyer, Luther R. Marsh, and the still vigorous\r\npublicist, John Bigelow, will never cease to have a charm for the\r\nretired veteran of letters and the law. It should never cease to\r\ninterest also the active and alert practitioner who, on its rugged\r\nhills and in its peaceful valleys and by its murmuring streams and\r\nfrom its bracing atmosphere can draw vitality, inspiration and\r\ndelight--strength for the duties of each succeeding hour as he seeks\r\nto emulate the lofty virtues and resplendent talents of those whose\r\neyes, like his, once wandered with rapture over its entrancing\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\n                NOTE BY THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\nThe Editor deeply regrets that since the modesty of the author has\r\nforbidden any reference to himself this review of the period in which\r\nMr. Vanamee himself has borne so honorable and conspicuous a part\r\ncontains no description of his own brilliant career as an advocate.\r\nBut though it is thus unavoidable that his signal talents and\r\naccomplishments should not be specifically portrayed in these pages,\r\nstill the intelligent reader will not fail to perceive in these\r\ngraphic estimates of his contemporaries an unconscious reflection of\r\nhis own commanding character, lofty ideals and acknowledged\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE COUNTY OF ORANGE.\r\n\r\nBy John T. Howell, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early history of Orange County is intimately connected with the\r\nphysicians who practiced there, and had they undertaken the task, it\r\nis logical to assume that no citizens could have narrated the history\r\nof their day and locality better than they. Unfortunately the duties\r\nand hardships then attendant upon the practice of medicine so limited\r\noutside literary work as to have left even the annals of medicine\r\nbare of many important facts which it would seem ought to have been\r\nrecorded. It is stated that at one time Dr. David R. Arnell expressed\r\nhis intention to write a history of Orange County, but he failed to\r\ncarry out this undertaking which he was so well qualified to perform.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier periods of the county's existence medical education\r\nbegan to feel the impulse of independence and the wider knowledge\r\nresulting therefrom, developed a higher standard of practice.\r\n\r\nThis advancement was undoubtedly favored by the self-dependence\r\nbrought out in practice through widely separated settlements, and\r\nOrange County early established a reputation for skillful physicians.\r\nThe renowned traits and ability of many of these physicians remain\r\nonly in tradition, but the anecdotes told of some of them show that\r\nthey were men of more than ordinary attainments. Among those\r\nphysicians best known in the early history of the county are Dr.\r\nCadwallader Colden, who, besides being a medical author of note, was\r\nhonored with the title of Lieutenant-Colonial Governor; Dr. Moses\r\nHigby, who is remembered by his successful use of an emetic in the\r\ncase of a British spy, and Dr. Benjamin Tusten for his heroism at the\r\nbattle of Minisink. Other physicians have no doubt rendered equally\r\nmeritorious services in less conspicuous ways, but being unrecorded\r\nremain uncredited in history.\r\n\r\nSome interesting statistics have been collected by Dr. W. L.\r\nCuddeback regarding the average length of stay of about ninety\r\nphysicians who settled in Port Jervis and vicinity. Of these,\r\nsixty-five per cent, removed or died within five years; eighty per\r\ncent, before ten years; eighty-five per cent, before fifteen years,\r\nand ninety per cent, before the end of twenty years of practice\r\nthere. The reasons for this well known lack of permanency and short\r\nlongevity of physicians are best understood by those who really know\r\nthe peculiar trials, dangers and discouragements of the daily life of\r\na doctor. The character developed by the experiences of thirty or\r\nforty years of medical practice is logically one worthy of admiration\r\nand emulation and this is proven by the appreciative and unshaken\r\nposition uniformly held by the old family physician \"Our doctor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John T. Howell, M.D.]\r\n\r\nA perusal of the older records reveal many interesting customs and\r\npractices of the physicians of those days. Travel was generally on\r\nhorseback and the distances were often so great that meal hour or\r\nnightfall compelled the weary doctor to accept the proffered\r\nhospitality of his patients. Saddle bags were made to hold a\r\nveritable armamentum and the doctor must tarry long enough to put up\r\nhis own prescriptions. Bloodletting, blistering and emetics were\r\nremedies often employed and were, perhaps, as potent for good as some\r\nother extreme measures which were later substituted with greater\r\nconfidence and found after all to have but a limited field of\r\nusefulness. The average physician has but little time for public\r\naffairs, but a number of the Orange County doctors have held public\r\noffices both in the County and as representatives in the State and\r\nNational legislatures. In times of war, too, our doctors names are\r\nfound enrolled in the military lists and their records there have\r\nbeen most creditable. Other physicians seem to have found time for\r\nliterary pursuits; but these efforts have been mostly along medical\r\nlines. The patriotic gift of the Minisink Monument by one of their\r\nnumber is a matter of great pride and satisfaction to the physicians\r\nof this county.\r\n\r\nThe records of the _Orange County Medical Society,_ although\r\nabbreviated, present the local history of medicine more fully than it\r\nis to be found elsewhere. Even here we may search in vain for data\r\nwhich the busy physicians who have acted as secretaries have failed\r\nto record. However, extending as they do over nearly the whole of the\r\nlast century we can find many facts of interest, especially in the\r\nearlier years of its existence. No county society was formed until\r\nafter the passage of an act of the Legislature, April 4, 1806. This\r\nlaw, under which the Orange County and twelve other county societies\r\nwere soon incorporated, permitted each licensed physician in the\r\ncounty to become a charter member and each society to elect a\r\nrepresentative to the State society, which was to be composed of such\r\ndelegates. The county society had the right to examine both\r\nphysicians desiring to practice in the county and students of\r\nmedicine who applied for licenses.\r\n\r\nUpon the first pages of the minutes is found a concise report of the\r\norganization of the Medical Society of the County of Orange, with the\r\nnames of the founders and officers elected. It reads in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Agreeable to a law of the State of New York, passed the fourth day\r\nof April, 1806, entitled 'An Act to incorporate Medical Societies for\r\nthe purpose of regulating the practice of Physic and Surgery in this\r\nState,' the physicians and surgeons of Orange County met at the\r\nCourt House in Goshen on Tuesday, the first day of July, 1806.\r\n\r\n\"Drs. Jonathan Swezy, Chairman (pro tem), Thomas Wickham, Clerk (pro\r\ntem), Elijah Randall, William Elmer, William Elliott, Samuel S.\r\nSeward, Benjamin S. Hoyt, Nathaniel Elmer, Elisha Du Bois, Charles\r\nFowler, David R. Arnell, Samuel Warner, William McCoppin, Aaron M.\r\nSmith, William Gourley, Elihu Hedges, Eleazer Gedney, Ethan Watson,\r\nCornelius Roosa, James Bradner, Henry I. Hornbeck and Elijah Welch\r\nwere present and produced their several licenses to practice physic.\r\nThe Society then proceeded to organize and elect officers when the\r\nfollowing gentlemen were elected for the ensuing year: Dr. Jonathan\r\nSwezy, President; Dr. Samuel S. Seward, Vice-President; Dr. Nathaniel\r\nElmer, Secretary; and Dr. Thomas Wickham, Treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"Drs. Anthony Davis, Joseph Houston, Joseph Whelan and Jonathan\r\nHedges were, upon examination, licensed to practice physic and\r\nsurgery in this State and admitted members to this Society. Dr. David\r\nR. Arnell was elected delegate to the Medical Society of the State of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n\"Drs. Anthony Davis, Elisha Du Bois, Charles Fowler, Joseph Whelan and\r\nCornelius Davis were appointed censors.\"\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the earlier meetings were admirably kept and are still\r\nin an excellent state of preservation.\r\n\r\nThe autographs of the founders and other members who signed the\r\nby-laws form an interesting and valuable collection. The by-laws were\r\ncarefully drawn and consisted of twenty-six articles. Meetings were\r\nheld semi-annually or quarterly, and, as indicated by the titles, the\r\npapers read and discussed were of a high order. Notwithstanding such\r\nevidences of proficiency I find that these physicians were very\r\npoorly paid. In a rate list adopted by the society in 1807, the\r\ncharge for a visit of less than one mile was but twenty-five cents,\r\nwith a corresponding low charge for medicines furnished, and, the\r\nlargest fee asked for any operation was one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nDr. Arnell, who may be called the father of the Orange County Medical\r\nSociety, was elected president of the society eight times and was a\r\ncharter member of the State Society. In 1818 he presented a library\r\nto the society. It contained fifty volumes, which, with five of the\r\nbest medical periodicals, were circulated among the members\r\nthroughout the county. This collection formed a nucleus for\r\nsubsequent additions and a valuable and useful library was maintained\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the membership of the society numbered sixty, of whom\r\ntwenty-five attended the annual meeting.\r\n\r\nAmong notable resolutions passed was one in 1830 endorsing the\r\nAmerican Temperance Society and the tenets of temperance in general;\r\nin 1832 the formation of health boards in each town; and in 1839 a\r\nresolution recommending a change in the method of examining and\r\nlicensing students of medicine, the whole to be placed in the hands\r\nof the Regents, was forwarded to the State Medical Society. Such\r\nefforts were highly creditable and progressive, as is shown by the\r\nfact that the law providing for the last named recommendation was\r\nnot passed until 1893.\r\n\r\nAn important amendment to the by-laws adopted at a meeting in 1840\r\nmarks the beginning of a prolonged and troublesome epoch of\r\ncontroversy over medical ethics, especially in regard to sectarian\r\nforms of practice, including homeopathy, then being introduced in\r\nthis vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe status of practice among the members of the society having always\r\nbeen regular (_i. e.,_ belonging to the general school of scientific\r\nmedicine and not restricted by any sect or pathy), much criticism was\r\naroused by the attempt of some of the local physicians to practice\r\naccording to Hahnemann's Laws of \"Like cures like.\" \"Medicinal\r\npotency increased by dilution,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAn application for membership to the society from a physician who\r\npracticed that system was promptly rejected at the next meeting and\r\nmuch discussion ensued. The subject was frequently referred to in the\r\nminutes of the meetings for a number of subsequent years, and in 1851\r\nseveral members were expelled from the society for practicing\r\nhomeopathy. Rules forbidding members to consult with homeopathic\r\nphysicians were passed, and in 1856 there was prepared and printed\r\nfor public information a system of popular ethics, explaining fully\r\nthe position of the society regarding the whole subject of ethics.\r\nFeeling ran high over the matter for a long time, as is shown by the\r\nlengthy discussions and resolutions devoted to the subject in the\r\nminutes, year after year. Gradually, as it became evident that there\r\nwas an increasing abandonment of sectarian practice, a reaction came;\r\nbut it was not until 1883 that this society, following the lead of\r\nthe State Society, adopted a new code which permitted, under\r\nreasonable restrictions, consultations between regular and sectarian\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\nDr. Merritt H. Cash, by his will in 1861, left a legacy to the State\r\nSociety of five hundred dollars which is known as \"The Merritt H.\r\nCash Fund.\" The fund now amounts to seven hundred and fifty dollars\r\nand the interest is devoted to a prize essay written by members of\r\nthe county medical societies throughout the State. Dr. Cash also\r\nleft four thousand dollars for the monument erected at Goshen in\r\nhonor of those who fell at the battle of Minisink. The society was,\r\nof course, much interested in this event and was accorded a prominent\r\nplace at the unveiling of the monument July 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nFour members represented this society and served as surgeons with\r\ncredit and distinction during the Civil War: Dr. R. V. K. Montfort\r\nand Dr. J. H. Thompson in the 124th, Dr. Solomon Van Etten in the\r\n56th, and Dr. Theodore Cooper (assistant surgeon) in the 156th\r\nregiment of volunteers.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 the society received a special invitation to attend the\r\ncelebration of the centennial of the battle of Minisink. This\r\ninvitation was in recognition of the county's obligation to the\r\ndonor, Dr. Merritt H. Cash, and for the patriotic and heroic services\r\nrendered by Dr. Benjamin Tusten at the battle of Minisink, July 22,\r\n1779, where his life was sacrificed in the actual performance of his\r\nprofessional duties.\r\n\r\nThe last quarter of the century is notable in the history of the\r\nsociety for a renewal of interest and increased literary work. This\r\nwas the developmental era of antiseptic and aseptic surgery, and the\r\nrecords, as shown by the papers read and the cases reported, were\r\ncreditable to the progressive spirit and practice of the members of\r\nthe society.\r\n\r\nA resolution to the effect that all members of the society, in good\r\nstanding for thirty years, be constituted honorary members was\r\nadopted in June, 1887. This honor was accordingly bestowed upon Dr.\r\nBartow Wright, whose membership dated from 1834, and upon Dr. Harvey\r\nEverett, who joined the society in 1839. The former died in 1890 and\r\nthe latter April 8, 1899, having been a member of the society for\r\nsixty years.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 revised by-laws were adopted, one of which admitted to\r\nmembership any licensed physician who declared his full abnegation of\r\nsectarian principles and practice. This invitation was an expression\r\nof a principle and belief which it is hoped will in the near future\r\nrally all physicians to a broad standard of practice, and the recent\r\nlaw enacted, which provides but one board of examiners to grant State\r\nlicenses to physicians of all schools, is another hopeful sign of\r\nmedical unity.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, at the breaking out of the war with Spain, Dr. James R.\r\nWood, a member of this society, volunteered and accompanied the\r\n101st Regiment to Cuba. There he afterwards died in the performance\r\nof his duties, which were those of endeavoring to render sanitary the\r\nalmost impossible conditions at Guanajay.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1901, the Orange County Medical Association was\r\norganized, about which time a successful effort was made to complete\r\nthe organization of associations in those counties where they had not\r\nbeen formed when the State Association split off from the State\r\nSociety, because of the code question in 1882. The two sets of\r\norganizations had not been long maintained, however, when a\r\ncomparison of their ethical standards revealed the fact that twenty\r\nyears had so modified opinions as to have practically removed the\r\ndifferences. The associations, however, had the advantage of the\r\nrecognition of the American Medical Association, which had never been\r\naccorded the societies since their adoption of the new code of\r\nethics. In order to avail themselves of membership in the national\r\nassociation many of the members of the societies joined the\r\nassociations, too, and the barriers between the two organizations\r\neventually became completely broken down.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the amalgamated county societies was held at\r\nNewburgh, January 25, 1906, the combined membership being\r\nseventy-nine.\r\n\r\nThe society had three hundred and thirty-eight members and\r\nforty-eight honorary members during one hundred years. Of these\r\nsixty-two were elected to the office of president one or more times,\r\ntwenty-three to the office of secretary, and twenty-three to the\r\noffice of treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe centennial celebration of the society was held at Goshen, Monday,\r\nJuly 2, 1906. The first part of the exercises consisting of addresses\r\nand an historical sketch--were conducted in the board of supervisors\r\nroom in the County Building, which stands on the same ground once\r\noccupied by the old Court House, in which the society was organized,\r\nJuly 1, 1806. A collation, followed by short speeches, was afterwards\r\nheld in Music Hall, which had been decorated for the occasion with\r\nflags and bunting. Eighty-five members and guests were present.\r\n\r\n(A list of the officers and members of this society will be found in\r\nthe chronological table.)\r\n\r\nThe second medical society formed in the county was the _Homeopathic\r\nMedical Society of Orange County._\r\n\r\nThis society was organized November 12, 1851, at the time when\r\nconsiderable local interest had been awakened in this system of\r\npractice and the controversy heretofore mentioned was going on\r\nbetween the new and old schools. The first meeting was held in\r\nNewburgh when by-laws were adopted and the following officers\r\nelected:\r\n\r\nDrs. A. Gerald Hull, president; Dewitt C. Jayne, vice-president;\r\nIra T. Bradner, secretary and treasurer; and W. A. M. Culbert,\r\ncorresponding secretary. A committee was also appointed to prepare an\r\naddress to the public in answer to that on ethics published by the\r\nOrange County Medical Society.\r\n\r\nQuarterly meetings were held during the first year, but no records of\r\nsubsequent meetings are again found until January 11, 1870. The\r\nmeetings were at first resumed semi-annually, but after three years,\r\nmore interest seems to have been taken and the society met every\r\nthree months. From time to time papers were read by members of the\r\nsociety bearing upon important topics and the society continued\r\nactive for a number of years. After 1888 the meetings were held but\r\ntwice a year, and interest waned until 1891, when they were\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\n(A list of the officers and members of this society will be found in\r\nthe chronological table.)\r\n\r\n_The Tri-States Medical Society._--This society was organized in\r\nSeptember, 1871, by a number of physicians living in Port Jervis and\r\nthe adjacent counties of the three States, New York, Pennsylvania and\r\nNew Jersey, which join near there. Drs. Solomon Van Etten, Isaac S.\r\nHunt, O. A. Carroll and P. G. McCabe represented Orange County in the\r\nformation of the society.\r\n\r\nQuarterly meetings were held and fifty physicians became members\r\nduring the first ten years. The society flourished for about eighteen\r\nyears but was finally discontinued, probably because of a renewed\r\ninterest in the county societies. Several Orange County physicians\r\nserved as officers of the society.\r\n\r\n(A list of the officers and members of this society residing in\r\nOrange County will be found in the chronological table.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. L. Cuddeback. M.D.]\r\n\r\n_The Newburgh Bay Medical Society._--This society was organized\r\nSeptember 10, 1895. The first meeting was held at the Palatine\r\nHotel, Newburgh.\r\n\r\nThere were present Drs. A. E. Adams, John Deyo, A. V. Jova, C. E.\r\nTownsend and J. T. Howell. Dr. Adams was elected temporary chairman\r\nand Dr. Townsend, secretary. Committees were appointed to secure\r\nadditional members and draft a constitution and by-laws, after which\r\nthe meeting adjourned until October 8th next. At that meeting there\r\nwere present, besides the above mentioned, Drs. E. H. Borst, W. L.\r\nCarr, E. F. Brooks, W. S. Gleason, R. V. K. Monfort, G. Garlzman and\r\nM. C. Stone.\r\n\r\nThe society was named and by-laws adopted. The object of the\r\nsociety was declared to be the banding together of congenial\r\nphysicians residing in Newburgh and vicinity for the purpose of study\r\nand discussion of medical and surgical topics and scientific subjects\r\nrelative thereto, and the promotion of social intercourse among its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe society was incorporated November 8, 1897, and at that time had\r\ntwenty-nine members. Since then interest in the society has been\r\nfully maintained, as is evidenced by the unusual record of individual\r\nwork and attendance on the part of the members. The present\r\nmembership numbers forty-two, of whom twenty-six are residents of\r\nthis county. The meetings are held bi-monthly and are usually at\r\nNewburgh.\r\n\r\n(A list of the officers and members of this society will be found in\r\nthe chronological table.)\r\n\r\n_The Orange County Medical Association_ was organized February 12,\r\n1901, in Middletown, by Drs. M. C. Connor, W. E. Douglas, A. W.\r\nPreston. C. I. Redfield, William Evans, E. A. Nugent, L. G. Distlar\r\nand F. D. Myers. The following officers were elected: Drs. M. C.\r\nConnor, president; F. W. Dennis, vice-president; Charles I. Redfield,\r\nsecretary and treasurer. A committee on by-laws was appointed and the\r\nmeeting adjourned until March 12, 1901, to perfect the organization.\r\nAt the adjourned meeting the appointment of committees was completed\r\nand the membership found to be sixteen, including those already\r\nbelonging to the New York State Association. The additional members\r\nnot mentioned above were: Drs. E. F. Brooks, J. B. Hulett, W. L.\r\nPurdy, R. A. Taylor, C. E. Townsend, H. E. Wise, and E. D. Woodhull.\r\nMeetings were held monthly in the different larger places of the\r\ncounty and much interest was maintained by securing the uniform\r\npresence of some recognized authority on a special subject for each\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 1905, the New York State Medical Association and\r\nMedical Society were amalgamated and the formal union of the\r\ncorresponding county organizations took place, as heretofore stated,\r\nat Newburgh, January 25, 1906. The association at that time had\r\nthirty-seven members, a number of whom belonged also to the county\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n(A list of the officers and members of this association will be found\r\nin the chronological table.)\r\n\r\n_Homeopathic Medical Society of Dutchess, Orange and Ulster\r\nCounties._--The above-named society was formed in response to a\r\nsuggestion of the Dutchess County Homeopathic Society. The first\r\nmeeting was held in Poughkeepsie, but the society was not regularly\r\norganized until a meeting held at Newburgh June 24, 1902. Since that\r\ntime the members have met regularly at Newburgh in the months of May\r\nand October each year, and much interest has been manifested. The\r\npresent number of members is twenty-four, eighteen of whom reside in\r\nOrange County. Dr. William E. Reed, of Washingtonville, is now\r\npresident, and Dr. F. A. Jacobson, of Newburgh, secretary and\r\ntreasurer of the society.\r\n\r\n(A list of the officers and members of this society residing in\r\nOrange County will be found in the chronological table.)\r\n\r\n                MIDDLETOWN STATE HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nDuring the past thirty-seven years several hospitals have been built\r\nand conducted in the different larger places of the county. First\r\namong these was the Middletown State Hospital (homeopathic) for the\r\ncare and treatment of the insane, which was incorporated in 1869.\r\nFunds were collected by Dr. George F. Foote, and a farm purchased\r\nnear Middletown as a site for the present hospital. About\r\nseventy-five thousand dollars was raised by private subscription, a\r\npart of which was used in hospital construction. The following year,\r\n1870, the first appropriation was made by the State and the main\r\nbuilding was opened for the reception of patients in the spring of\r\n1874, with Dr. Foote as superintendent. After a brief service Dr.\r\nFoote resigned and Dr. Henry R. Stiles was appointed superintendent,\r\nwhich position he held until 1877, when he resigned, and Dr. Selden\r\nH. Talcott was appointed to fill the vacancy. Dr. Talcott served for\r\ntwenty-five years until his death, June 15, 1902, and under his\r\nmanagement the institution developed nearly to its present\r\nproportions. The present superintendent, Dr. Maurice L. Ashley, was\r\nappointed his successor.\r\n\r\nThe farm and grounds comprise nearly three hundred acres, on which\r\nthere are thirty buildings, the value of the real and personal\r\nproperty being over $1,500,000. The present annual expenses for all\r\npurposes are about $245,000. Since the opening of the institution the\r\nreports show seven thousand patients received and treated. Of this\r\nnumber two thousand six hundred have been discharged recovered, and\r\nnine hundred improved. The number of patients under treatment at\r\npresent is one thousand three hundred. Buildings planned and under\r\nconstruction will increase the accommodations to a capacity of one\r\nthousand eight hundred and fifty patients and four hundred and fifty\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\nThe medical staff consists of nine members: Maurice C. Ashley, M.D.,\r\nmedical superintendent; Robert C. Woodman, M.D., first assistant\r\nphysician; George F. Brewster, M.D., second assistant physician; Roy\r\nE. Mitchell, M.D., third assistant physician; Arthur S. Moore, M.D.,\r\njunior assistant physician; Clara Barrus, M.D., woman assistant\r\nphysician, and their interns.\r\n\r\n                  ST. LUKE'S HOSPITAL, NEWBURGH.\r\n\r\nThis institution was founded as a \"Home for the aged, the indigent,\r\nand the infirm and a Hospital for the sick and disabled.\" The\r\nhospital work for a number of years was of secondary importance, but\r\nduring the latter half of its existence that has been the principal\r\nwork of the institution, until now both the name and the work of the\r\nHome are discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe society was organized July 21, 1874, by representative members of\r\nthe Protestant Episcopal parishes of Newburgh and New Windsor, which\r\ninfluence has until recently predominated in the management, although\r\nthe work has been wholly non-sectarian in character. A constitution was\r\nadopted November 4, 1874, and the institution became incorporated.\r\nJanuary 5, 1876. The corporation originally leased different places\r\nuntil the present reservoir site on Carpenter avenue was purchased.\r\nOn March 23, 1886, the property on Liberty street was secured, where\r\nvarious buildings were erected and changes made from time to time.\r\nRecently, March 29, 1907, the seminary building and large grounds on\r\nDubois street have been secured, where the fine elevation and\r\nsurroundings will better accommodate the increasing needs of the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nDuring the past fiscal year there were treated seven hundred and\r\nseventy-four patients. There are forty-eight beds. A training school\r\nfor nurses was established in 1893, which now numbers twenty.\r\n\r\nThe society is a membership corporation and by a change in the\r\nconstitution adopted November 22, 1906, has become non-sectarian in\r\nits management. It derives its income from the charges paid by\r\npatients, from voluntary contributions and from the interest received\r\nfrom an endowment fund of $47,415.21. Among the pioneer workers was\r\nDr. Smith Ely, whose interest and zeal had much to do with\r\nestablishing the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe present staff consists of four consulting and eleven attending\r\nmembers:\r\n\r\nConsulting Staff--Robert Abbe, M.D., surgeon; Stephen D. Harrison,\r\nM.D., physician; Henry D. Nicoll, M.D., gynecologist; Henry L.\r\nWinter, M.D., neurologist.\r\n\r\nAttending Staff--John T Howell, M.D., and Charles E. Townsend, M.D.,\r\nsurgeons; William J. Carr, M.D., and E. C. Thompson, M.D., assistant\r\nsurgeons; Andrew V. Jova, M.D., and W. Stanton Gleason. M.D.,\r\nphysicians; John Deyo, M.D., and William H. Snyder, M.D., assistant\r\nphysicians; Alpheus E. Adams, M.D., ophthalmologist and otologist;\r\nLouis R. Pierce, M.D., obstetrician; A. Judson Benedict, M.D.,\r\nrhinologist and laryngologist.\r\n\r\n                   THE PORT JERVIS HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nThis hospital was established January 1, 1887, by Dr. J. H. Hunt as a\r\nmemorial to his father, Dr. J. S. Hunt. It accommodated twenty\r\npatients and was located on the corner of Ball and Sussex streets.\r\n\r\nOn March 8, 1892, the hospital was purchased by Drs. W. L. Cuddeback\r\nand H. B. Swartwout, who enlarged and remodeled it, providing\r\nadditional private rooms, the use of which was extended to outside\r\nphysicians. The hospital was again sold on September 1, 1895, the\r\npurchasers beings several physicians living in Port Jervis and\r\nvicinity, who formed a corporation for that purpose. The hospital,\r\nbesides doing general work, has always especially provided for the\r\ncare of the injured employees of the Erie Railroad Company.\r\n\r\nA training school for nurses was established in 1896, which now\r\nnumbers five nurses. The number of beds in the present hospital is\r\ntwenty-five. The number of patients treated during the fiscal year\r\nending 1907 was one hundred and thirty-four. The present attending\r\nstaff consists of Drs. Cuddeback and Swartwout.\r\n\r\n                 THRALL HOSPITAL, MIDDLETOWN.\r\n\r\nThis institution was organized largely through the efforts of Dr.\r\nJulia E. Bradner and eight other ladies representing different\r\nchurches, who raised a fund of over five thousand dollars toward the\r\nproject. Mrs. S. Maretta Thrall subsequently came to their assistance\r\nand donated not only the grounds but the building, thus placing the\r\nhospital upon a firm basis in the early days of its history. The fund\r\nalready collected was used for furnishing and equipment.\r\n\r\nThe hospital was opened May 10, 1892. A training school for nurses\r\nwas established in 1894, which now numbers ten. The number of beds in\r\nthe hospital, including those in private rooms, is thirty-five. The\r\nnumber of patients treated during the fiscal year ending 1907 was\r\nfour hundred and fifty-five. The present staff has six consulting and\r\nnine attending members:\r\n\r\nConsulting Staff---Dr. M. C. Ashley, neurologist; Dr. Francis Walk,\r\nDr. J. I. Lent, ophthalmologists; Dr. W. E. Douglas, Dr. E. L.\r\nFancher, Dr. C. W. Dennis, physicians.\r\n\r\nVisiting Staff--Dr. T. D. Mills, Dr. J. B. Hulett, Dr. W. L. Purdy,\r\nsurgeons; Dr. Julia E. Bradner, Dr. J. L. Hammer, Dr. D. B.\r\nHardenburgh, Dr. M. A. Stivers, Dr. C. I. Redfield. Dr. E. M.\r\nSchultz, physicians.\r\n\r\n                   THE DR. MacDONALD HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe Dr. MacDonald House at Central Valley, formerly known as\r\n\"Falkirk,\" was founded by Dr. James Francis Ferguson in 1889.\r\n\r\nThis institution was designed and built for the special care of\r\npatients suffering from nervous diseases. Originally it accommodated\r\nbut fifteen patients, but it was enlarged by the construction of\r\nanother large cottage called the \"Stanleigh,\" and now can care for\r\ntwice that number. Its beautiful location and surroundings contribute\r\nto make it an ideal home for such patients.\r\n\r\nFollowing the death of Dr. Ferguson, in 1904, the sanitarium was\r\nconducted for two years by Dr. Henry A. Ferguson and William E.\r\nFerguson, when it was purchased by its present proprietor and\r\nphysician in charge, Dr. Carlos F. MacDonald, who has associated with\r\nhim Dr. Clarence J. Slocum as a resident physician.\r\n\r\n                        INTERPINES.\r\n\r\nThis sanitarium is located at Goshen and was established in June,\r\n1890, by Dr. F. W. Seward. It then had fourteen beds for patients,\r\nbut in 1897 the capacity of the institution was increased by\r\ncommodious additions, to fifty-six patients. The institution affords\r\nall the advantages of a modern home for invalids especially for the\r\ntreatment of disorders of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nIt is conducted by Dr. Seward and his son, Dr. F. W Seward, Jr., who\r\nhas been associated with his father for the past eight years.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe limitations of space allotted this article not allowing the\r\npresentation of biographies, I have collected and arranged the\r\nfollowing data relating to the physicians who have settled in Orange\r\nCounty and practiced there since 1728.\r\n\r\nThe dates include the period of practice in this county, terminating\r\neither by removal or death. The residences designated generally\r\nrefer to villages or larger places, but sometimes only the townships\r\nare known. The last column contains the names of the medical college\r\nor society granting the diploma or license, memberships and offices\r\nin county medical societies and positions or connections with local\r\nhospitals, etc. In all cases every endeavor has been made to obtain\r\nthe full data, and careful verification made of all information\r\nreceived. In a number of cases it has been impossible to determine\r\nthe dates, and even the residences of some of the practitioners could\r\nnot be ascertained. In other cases the source of their diploma or\r\nlicense cannot be found in any of the records. Special mention has\r\nbeen made in a comparatively few instances where physicians are known\r\nto have held distinguished positions or have been otherwise honored,\r\nbut omissions should not be construed to indicate inferiority of the\r\nstanding of those worthy physicians who labored on in dignified\r\nsilence, although conscious of many a triumph in the art of life\r\nsaving.\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to those physicians and other interested\r\nfriends who have furnished information and data and especially to Dr.\r\nL. R. Pierce who assisted in the compilation of this table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. W. Many]\r\n\r\n  A CHRONOLOGICAL LIST OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE PRACTICED IN ORANGE\r\n    COUNTY.

Dolph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the State of New York, including all those\r\nportions which were settled in the seventeenth century or in the early\r\npart of the eighteenth, have this common feature in their educational\r\nhistory. They all show three periods of development, separate and\r\ndistinct from each other, and these periods are characterized,\r\nlargely, by the initiative under which the schools were organized and\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe first of these periods, which we may call the colonial period,\r\nreaches from the first settlement of the country down to the time of\r\nthe Revolutionary War. During this time, about seventy-five years,\r\nwhatever schools there were in Orange County, were organized and\r\nsupported entirely by the settlers in the different neighborhoods,\r\nfor the instruction of their own children.\r\n\r\nThere were no large villages in Orange County at that time. The\r\ncommunities were purely agricultural, with small hamlets scattered\r\nhere and there, such as are found in agricultural districts to-day,\r\nand the educational advantages were very limited. This period\r\nculminated in the struggle for independence, during which even these\r\nlimited advantages were almost entirely swept away.\r\n\r\nDuring the war of the Revolution, the settled portions of the State\r\nwere overrun by armed bands again and again. The valley of the Hudson\r\nwas harried by the contending armies, back and forth for years, and,\r\neven where there were no armies, the virulence of the feeling which\r\nexisted between the patriots and the Tories, was such that there was\r\nlittle more safety for life and property in those localities than\r\nthere was at the very seat of war.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the schools were generally closed and the\r\ngeneration which grew up during the Revolution was largely without\r\nregular instruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John M. Dolph.]\r\n\r\nToward the end of the war, when actual hostilities had largely\r\nceased, there was a great awakening throughout the State to the\r\nnecessity for more and better schools than had ever existed\r\nheretofore. Mingling with those who had enjoyed better educational\r\nadvantages, in the camp and on the field, had taught the pioneers the\r\nvalue of education, and they determined to make it possible for their\r\nchildren to become better equipped, educationally, than they had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nPrivate academies, for classical training, were established in the\r\nsmall towns and villages and a new period, which we may call the\r\nperiod of the private schools, began.\r\n\r\nIn response to this sentiment in favor of higher education, the\r\nLegislature passed the University law in 1784, establishing the\r\nUniversity of the State of New York and giving the authority and the\r\naid of the State to the academies which had already been established\r\nand encouraging the establishment of others. The object of this\r\nmovement by the Legislature, as defined in the act establishing the\r\nUniversity, was \"to encourage and promote education in advance of the\r\ncommon, elementary branches.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a characteristic feature of the thought and feeling of this\r\nperiod that the State should give its aid and authority to private\r\ninstitutions for secondary instruction long years before it\r\nrecognized in any way, its duty to the common school and elementary\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nSoon the private academies became so numerous that the opportunity\r\nfor higher education reached to every part of the State. These\r\nschools did a grand work. For three-quarters of a century they opened\r\nup opportunities for the ambitious boys and girls whose parents were\r\nable to pay for their tuition.\r\n\r\nThen, a new idea appeared in educational matters--the idea that the\r\nchild of the poor man has as much right to the opportunity for\r\neducation as the child of the rich, and that it is the duty of the\r\nState to provide this opportunity for rich and poor alike. So the\r\nperiod of the free schools followed that of the private academies.\r\n\r\n                      THE COLONIAL PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe first settlements in what is now Orange County were made not far\r\nfrom the same time in both the eastern and western extremities. The\r\ncounty then included what is now Rockland County, and was bounded on\r\nthe north by the line separating the counties of Orange and Ulster.\r\nThis line ran from the mouth of Murderer's Creek (now Moodna)\r\n\"westward into the woods as far as the Delaware River.\" These\r\nsettlements were made previous to 1700, but the time is not\r\nabsolutely certain with respect to either of them.\r\n\r\nIn the western part of the county, in what is now the town of\r\nDeerpark, the first settlers were Dutch and Huguenot families, who\r\ncame from Kingston and New Paltz. In the eastern part the settlers\r\ncame up the Hudson River and consisted almost entirely of English\r\nspeaking people from New York and the Long Island towns. In fact, so\r\nclose was the association with New York, that for some years the New\r\nYork reports included Orange and our county had no independent county\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn 1693, according to the report of Governor Fletcher, made by\r\nMatthew Clarkson, secretary of the province, there were in \"Orange\r\nCounty not above twenty families, for the present under the care of\r\nNew York.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1698 there were reported to Governor Bellomont about thirty\r\nfamilies and 140 children in Orange.\r\n\r\nThese children were scattered over a wide district, in pioneer homes,\r\nwhere luxuries were unknown and where even the necessaries of life\r\nwere difficult of attainment. There were no schools for their\r\ninstruction at this time, nor for a number of years afterward, but it\r\nis evident that many of them at least did secure the elements of an\r\neducation, either from their parents or from some other source, for\r\nwe find them later, in the Dutch and Huguenot settlements at any\r\nrate, as the men of affairs, prominent in the church and in the\r\ncommunity, able to read and write and to transact business in a\r\nbusiness-like manner.\r\n\r\nBy 1723 a second generation had grown up and new settlers had come\r\ninto the county. In that year 543 children are reported. By this time\r\nthe pioneers had overcome the greater difficulties of the early\r\nsettlement. Their farms yielded abundant supplies and there was\r\nopportunity to make provision for the instruction of their children.\r\nThat this opportunity was made use of and that some provision was\r\nmade, in most parts of the settlements, for the instruction of the\r\nboys and girls, there is little reason to doubt.\r\n\r\nThe young people of this generation learned \"to read and write and\r\ncast accounts,\" at any rate. There were few, if any, schoolhouses,\r\nand tradition has it that the teachers, like the tailors and the\r\nshoemakers, went about from house to house, giving instruction in the\r\nthree R's.\r\n\r\nAt this time no text-books had been published in America and books of\r\nall kinds were very scarce in the frontier settlements, so that the\r\nfew books attainable were quite generally provided by the teacher as\r\nthe tools of his profession. The hornbook was used for teaching\r\nbeginners. This was a flat piece of wood with a handle. On the flat\r\npart of this there was fastened a piece of horn, scraped thin to make\r\nit transparent. A strip of paper on which the lesson was written or\r\nprinted, was placed between the horn and the wood. These lessons,\r\nprotected by the horn, would last a long time and could be used by\r\nmany different pupils. The hornbook was used for teaching the\r\nletters, some of the combinations of vowels and consonants and either\r\nthe Lord's Prayer or some other verses of easy reading. A copy of the\r\nBible was often the only printed book in the school and was used as a\r\nreading book.\r\n\r\nThe material for the instruction in arithmetic, in language and the\r\nmore difficult words in spelling were contained in the teacher's\r\nnote-book, which he had carefully prepared, under the direction of\r\nsome other teacher, similarly equipped. These note-books contained\r\nthe rules and tables in arithmetic, many problems, lists of words for\r\nspelling and selections for memorizing. In fact, the teacher's\r\nnote-book was his tool-chest, and its size and completeness were his\r\nrecommendations. The possession of a Bible, a psalm book, a copy of\r\nDillingham's arithmetic or some other English work, and a few books\r\nof general literature were sufficient to mark the pioneer pedagogue\r\nas a man of great distinction in his profession.\r\n\r\nOn the hornbook the letters of the alphabet were usually followed by\r\nthe character &, to which were added the Latin words _per se_ and the\r\nEnglish word _and,_ making _& per se and._ Many of the teachers knew\r\nno Latin and condensed this into \"Ampersand,\" and this word has come\r\ndown to us meaningless, except as we know its origin.\r\n\r\nWhen the pupils had learned to use the quill pen, which the teacher\r\nfashioned for them with his penknife, they were provided with a few\r\nsheets of paper, bound together in strong covers, and they proceeded\r\nto make, more or less carefully, a note-book like the teacher's. Some\r\nof these note-books, still preserved, show the character of the work\r\ndone in these early schools. Besides the matters enumerated above\r\nsome have riddles and anecdotes, evidently intended as practice in\r\nlanguage. One which I have seen, written by a young lady, has the\r\nfollowing exercise for punctuation:\r\n\r\n    \"There is a lad in this land\r\n    Hath twenty nails upon each hand\r\n    Five and twenty on hands and feet\r\n    And this is true without deceit.\"\r\n\r\nMuch attention was paid to penmanship, and the copies prepared by the\r\nteacher were often as perfect as the engraved copies of the modern\r\ncopy-book. These copies were kept by the pupil and practiced with\r\npainstaking care. A reproduction of a copy written by Joseph Dolph,\r\nwith a quill pen of his own make is given to show the skill in\r\nlettering with which some of these old schoolmasters prepared their\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copy Book]\r\n\r\nIt would be of great interest if we could know more of these pioneers\r\nof the teacher's profession and their work. But there are few records\r\nof them left. They were generally men, in the early days always men,\r\nand probably few of them possessed much learning beyond the rudiments\r\nwhich they taught.\r\n\r\nThere was no opportunity for higher studies and the few young men who\r\ndesired to enter college had to find a tutor, usually a clergyman,\r\nwho could give him instruction in the preparatory studies.\r\n\r\nWhen the first schoolhouse in Orange County was built I do not know.\r\nIt is possible that there was a building used for this purpose on the\r\nQuassaick, now Newburgh, during the occupancy of the Palatinate\r\ncolony, previous to 1730. It is certain that a building for school\r\npurposes was erected there soon after 1752, although it is not\r\npossible to determine when this school was opened. There is reason to\r\nsuppose that a teacher was installed soon after the transfer of the\r\nGlebe lands to Alexander Colden and Richard Atherton \"as trustees\r\nthereof, for the sole use and behoof of a minister of the Church of\r\nEngland, as by law established, and a school-master, to have the care\r\nof souls and the instruction of the children of the neighboring\r\ninhabitants.\" This transfer was made in 1752.\r\n\r\nThe land known as the Glebe was part of a grant of 2190 acres on the\r\nwest side of the Hudson River, \"beginning on the north side of\r\nQuassaic Creek and extending up the Hudson 219 chains and into the\r\nwoods 100 chains,\" made for the benefit of a colony of Lutheran,\r\nrefugees from the Palatinate of the Rhine. They had crossed over to\r\nEngland and Queen Anne directed that this grant be made for them.\r\nFrom this tract 500 acres were set apart, \"according to the queen's\r\npleasure,\" for the support of their minister and 100 acres for the\r\nschoolmaster's lot. Although the Queens interest had been manifested\r\nin 1708, the patent was not issued until 1719, and then the land soon\r\npassed into other hands.\r\n\r\nAfter the transfer of the Glebe lands in 1752 as mentioned above, a\r\nhouse was built for the schoolmaster, \"with a school-room in the\r\nrear.\" Little is known of this school. Ruttenber, in his history of\r\nOrange County, gives the names of some of the teachers who were in\r\ncharge of it at different times before the Revolution, as follows:\r\nLewis Donveur, in 1768; Joseph Penney, in 1769; Thomas Gregory, in\r\n1773. In 1774 John Nathan Hutchinson became the teacher and continued\r\nin the school until shortly before his death, which occurred in 1782.\r\n\r\nThere were other schools in various parts of the county, previous to\r\nthe Revolution. One James Carpenter, a teacher at or near Goshen, is\r\nmentioned in certain records in 1762.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Deerpark, as it is now constituted, there were at\r\nleast two school buildings which were erected before the war. One of\r\nthese was located about a mile from the boundary of the city of Port\r\nJervis. on the east side of the Neversink River, and the other where\r\nthe village of Cuddebackville now stands. In this latter building\r\nThomas Kyte taught for some time. In 1775 he married Lea Keator and\r\nremoved from the valley to the town of Wantage, Sussex County, New\r\nJersey, where he became a prosperous farmer and where some of his\r\ndescendants still remain. In 1776 Thomas White, an Englishman, was\r\nemployed as teacher in the same district. He came, with his wife\r\nElizabeth, and lived at the home of Ezechiel Gumaer near the\r\nNeversink River. The school was also conducted in one of the rooms of\r\nthe Gumaer house. Later, when the house was reconstructed as a fort,\r\nfor the better protection of the people of the neighborhood, and\r\nseveral families had gathered there, the school was continued in the\r\nfort. Mr. White remained throughout the entire period of the war, and\r\nthe children who were so fortunate as to be his pupils, enjoyed\r\nadvantages which very few could have at that time. He was a man of\r\nsome literary attainments, small in stature, but quick and active in\r\nbody and mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Peter E. Gumaer (1770 to 1869) who was one of his pupils, says of\r\nhim, in his history of Deerpark: \"I conclude that Mr. White had been\r\ntaught in one of the best of the common schools of England, and in a\r\nvery perfect manner so far as he had progressed. He was a very\r\neloquent reader and could perform the same with an air suitable to\r\nthe nature of the subject on which the reading treated. I have always\r\nconsidered him as the equal of the best readers I have ever heard.\"\r\n\r\nCommenting on the advantages which Mr. White gave his pupils and the\r\nvalue of his services to the community, Mr. Gumaer says, \"This man's\r\nservices have been a greater benefit to the third generation of the\r\ndescendants of this neighborhood than those of any other individual,\r\nin consequence of which he ought to be held in remembrance by our\r\ndescendants and be incorporated in our history, as the first\r\nimportant originator of education among us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. White spent his old age on a farm in the town of Wallkill and is\r\nburied in the churchyard of the Presbyterian church at Otisville. In\r\nhis will he left a sum of money from the proceeds of which there\r\nshould be paid $10 each year, to the minister of each of four\r\ndifferent churches, for preaching a special sermon, to be known as\r\nThe White Sermon. The four churches benefited are the Dutch\r\nReformed church of Port Jervis, the Congregational church of\r\nMiddletown, and the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches of Goshen.\r\n\r\nThe school on the east side of the Neversink River, near Port Jervis,\r\nwas in session at the time of Brant's raid on Tuesday, July 20, 1779.\r\nThe Indians and Tories under Thayandanega, or, as the whites called\r\nhim, Joseph Brant, came down the Delaware valley and separated into\r\ntwo divisions. One party followed the river and the other crossed the\r\npoint of land between the two rivers, keeping near the base of the\r\nmountain and crossed the Neversink near the old Indian burying\r\nground. The object of the raid, as stated by Brant in his report to\r\nthe commanding officer, was to secure booty, especially beef cattle.\r\nBut it would appear from the method of attack that there was another\r\nobject, that of capturing or killing Major Decker.\r\n\r\nThe attack was made simultaneously upon the home of Major Decker and\r\nupon the farms four miles down the river across the State line, in\r\nNew Jersey. The men of the Major's family were away attending a\r\nfuneral and the house, although it was surrounded by a stockade, was\r\neasily taken and burned. It is probable that the most of the men were\r\nattending the funeral when the attack was made. This funeral, or at\r\nleast the burial, was held at the meeting house of the Dutch Reformed\r\nchurch, which stood on East Main street, near the culvert over which\r\nthe Erie Railroad crossed that street. This also was burned later in\r\nthe same raid. One of these bands came upon the school house with the\r\nschool in session. The teacher, Jeremiah Van Auken, grandson of James\r\nVan Auken, who was the first magistrate of the Minisink region, was\r\nkilled and scalped and the children scattered. According to the\r\ndeposition of Mehary Owen, one of the Tories who accompanied Brant on\r\nthis raid, that chieftain had issued strict orders that no women nor\r\nchildren should be injured. This deposition was taken by Henry\r\nWisner, Esq., at Goshen, and, while there is little dependence to be\r\nput upon the word of such a renegade, there is no proof that any of\r\nthe children were harmed.\r\n\r\nThe story so often told and sometimes discredited, that Brant himself\r\ncame upon the party that had killed Van Auken, and put paint upon the\r\nclothing of the children to protect them, is too well authenticated\r\nto be rejected. It is more than tradition.\r\n\r\nThere are persons still living who have heard the story told by those\r\nwho were there, on that day. Among others, Margaret Decker, daughter\r\nof Major Johannes Decker, horn in 1770, was there at school that day.\r\nShe afterward married Benjamin Carpenter and left many descendants.\r\nShe told the story many times to children and grandchildren,\r\nsubstantially as it has been told by the people of the valley since\r\n1779. Several of these grandchildren are still living and agree in\r\nall the main points of the story as she told it to them. This is only\r\none of many cases where the story is a family tradition.\r\n\r\nPeter E. Gumaer was a lad nine years old, at the time this occurred.\r\nHe was a neighbor and playfellow of those children in the other\r\ndistrict who were in school that day. He grew up with them and knew\r\nthem intimately all their lives, for he outlived them all, dying\r\nbeyond the middle of his ninety-ninth year. In his account of Brant's\r\nraid, given with slight alterations in Eager's History of Orange\r\nCounty, he tells the story substantially as it is told by the\r\ndescendants of these children. The addition of a brush and the color\r\nof the paint are touches not found in the original story.\r\n\r\nThis sketch of the schools in colonial times is fragmentary and\r\nunsatisfactory, but, there is so little that has been preserved\r\nconcerning them, that no account can be other than fragmentary.\r\n\r\n               THE PERIOD OF THE PRIVATE ACADEMIES.\r\n\r\nThe movement for the establishment of schools of higher grade began\r\nwith the people themselves. They knew what they wanted and proceeded\r\nto obtain it in the most direct way. The method was much the same all\r\nover the State. The farmers and other well-to-do people of a\r\nconsiderable section subscribed the money necessary to put up a\r\nbuilding and to provide the furniture and equipment needed. Then,\r\nwhen the building was ready for occupancy, it was leased to some\r\nteacher, whose compensation was the fees for tuition, paid by the\r\nstudents who attended. More than 300 of these institutions were\r\nestablished in the State.\r\n\r\nIn this movement for improved schools, the county of Orange was one\r\nof the first in the State to act. There were two other schools of\r\nthis type which were incorporated before The Farmers' Hall Academy in\r\nGoshen, but the incorporation was not until several years after these\r\nschools had been in operation. The Clinton Academy at Easthampton and\r\nthe Erasmus Hall Academy in Brooklyn, were both chartered by the\r\nBoard of Regents in 1787, while the Goshen school was not chartered\r\nuntil April first, 1790.\r\n\r\nThe building for the Farmers' Hall was erected in 1773 and the school\r\nwas maintained as a school for instruction in academic subjects\r\nduring the Revolution, with some interruptions.\r\n\r\nTo this school, in 1781, there came a man who was to do more for the\r\ncause of education in this county than any who had preceded him. Noah\r\nWebster had graduated from Yale in 1778 and had begun the study of\r\nlaw at Hartford. The invasion of New York from the north, by\r\nBurgoyne, called for the services of every able bodied man, and young\r\nWebster marched to the valley of the Mohawk, as a private in his\r\nfather's company of Connecticut militia. After the campaign was over,\r\nhe returned to the study of law and was admitted to the bar in\r\nHartford in 1781. Instead of waiting at Hartford for a practice, he\r\ndecided to enter the profession of teaching and probably came to\r\nGoshen in the fall of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe following letter of introduction, written by Henry Wisner, Esq.,\r\na magistrate of Goshen, would seem to indicate that Mr. Webster was\r\nnot a new comer in Goshen at that time and he had probably completed\r\nhis first year in the school when it was written:\r\n\r\n                                    Goshen, N. Y., August 26th, 1782.\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nThe bearer, Mr. Noah Webster, has taught a grammar school for some\r\ntime past, in this place, much to the satisfaction of his employers.\r\n\r\nHe is now doing some business in the literary way, which, in the\r\nopinion of good judges, will be of great service to posterity. He,\r\nbeing a stranger in New Jersey, may stand in need of the assistance\r\nof some gentlemen with whom you are acquainted. He is a young\r\ngentleman whose moral as well as political character is such as will\r\nrender him worthy of your notice.\r\n\r\nAny favor which you may do him will be serving the public and\r\naccepted as a favor done your friend and very humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                        Henry Wisner.\r\n\r\n  His Excellency, Governor Livingston.\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding year, Prof. Webster had prepared the manuscript\r\nof the first part of his \"Grammatical Institute of the English\r\nLanguage,\" the first text-book for the use of schools published in\r\nthis country. This first part was the Webster Speller, not only the\r\nfirst school book published in this country, but also the most\r\npopular one.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster's object in leaving Goshen at this time, was to show\r\nthese manuscripts to people acquainted with the educational situation\r\nthroughout the country and to get their opinions on the probable\r\ndemand for the work.\r\n\r\nHe visited Philadelphia and met a number of the members of Congress,\r\namong whom was James Madison, afterward president of the United\r\nStates. Mr. Madison was himself, a thorough linguist and deeply\r\ninterested in the subject of schools. He also showed much interest in\r\nMr. Webster and his proposed work. From Philadelphia, Mr. Webster\r\nwent to Princeton and showed his work to the Rev. S. S. Smith, then a\r\nprofessor and afterward president of Princeton College. Everywhere\r\nthe project was enthusiastically received and the young author\r\nreturned to Goshen, greatly encouraged to complete his series of\r\ntexts and to publish it.\r\n\r\nAs we have already stated, no text books had been published in\r\nAmerica. Moreover, at this time a widespread awakening to the\r\nimportance of education was manifest throughout the country and the\r\ndemand for books suitable for the instruction of the children, both\r\nin the elementary schools and in the academies was great.\r\nAccordingly, Prof. Webster returned to Goshen, continued his work\r\nthere another year, during which he revised and completed his\r\nmanuscripts, and in 1783, returned to Hartford and began their\r\npublication. The Grammatical Institution of the English Language was\r\npublished in three volumes. The first was the speller, the second the\r\ngrammar, and the third, the reader.\r\n\r\nThey seem poor and printed with wretched type, when compared with the\r\nworkmanship of modern text-books, but these little volumes, produced\r\nby an Orange County teacher, while teaching in its earliest academy,\r\nwere most enthusiastically received and the demand for them taxed the\r\ncapacity of the publishers to the fullest extent.\r\n\r\nThe speller, the first part published, was an immediate success. In\r\nfifty years, about twenty-five million copies were sold, and for a\r\npart of this time the sales exceeded a million copies a year. The\r\nroyalty on this book was one cent a copy, and, for many years this\r\nroyalty yielded the author a very comfortable income. The other parts\r\nof the work never had so large a demand as the speller, but the\r\nreception accorded them and the demand for them which followed,\r\ninduced the young author to devote his entire time to authorship, so\r\nthat his two years in the Farmers' Hall Academy, at Goshen, comprised\r\nhis entire work as a teacher.\r\n\r\nWhat other teachers conducted this school before the date of its\r\nincorporation under the university law, is not definitely known. The\r\ncharter was issued April 1st \"in the fourteenth year of American\r\nindependence,\" or 1790. The school, however, had been in operation at\r\nleast sixteen years, before this date, and ten years before the\r\nuniversity law was passed.\r\n\r\nThe first principal of the school, after its incorporation was\r\nBenjamin Carpenter, who remained only one year, and then removed to\r\nthe Minisink valley where he established a ferry over the Delaware\r\nand gave his name to the village of Carpenter's Point. A Mr. Minor\r\nsucceeded him and he in turn, was followed by John K. Joline, who was\r\nsaid to have been a soldier of fortune, and, as such, had visited the\r\nSpanish Main and several of the Central and South American States. He\r\nwas not a young man at the time of assuming the principal-ship and\r\ntradition tells many stories of his eccentricities. He had charge of\r\nthe school for several years and when he retired from the\r\nprincipal-ship, he remained in Goshen, living at one of the hotels\r\nuntil the time of his death. By a benevolent fiction he was supposed\r\nto deliver a course of lectures each year. The tickets were purchased\r\nby those who had been his pupils and by others who were benevolently\r\ninclined, and the proceeds were generally sufficient to defray his\r\nexpenses, but few of the lectures were delivered, and these to very\r\nsmall audiences. Occasionally he would fill an engagement to teach\r\nfor a few weeks, away from his beloved Goshen, but he could not be\r\npersuaded to stay away long. He taught at different times, in the\r\nMinisink valley, in what is now the town of Deerpark, but for short\r\nperiods only. He was erratic, leaving without notice, and returning\r\nwhen he pleased, and always going back to Goshen when he had earned\r\nmoney enough to relieve his present necessities.\r\n\r\nThere he would sit in his chair, on the porch of the hotel, always\r\nready to tell of the many and varied experiences of his life to any\r\nwho cared to listen.\r\n\r\nOne day he did not respond to the call of the gong which announced\r\nthat dinner was ready, and they found him, sitting in his chair,\r\ndead. He had died without a struggle and unnoticed, sitting in his\r\naccustomed place.\r\n\r\nSome time previous to 1820, the Female Academy was established and\r\nbecame a part of the institution, controlled by the same board of\r\ntrustees as the Farmer's Hall. William Ewen was the first principal\r\nin this department. Among the many teachers who had charge of this\r\nschool during the earlier half of the nineteenth century were:\r\nNathan Stark, Horace Sweezy, Victor M. Watkins, Rev. B. Y. Morse,\r\nDavid E. Fowler, Stephen D. Bross and Nathaniel Webb.\r\n\r\nThe last mentioned, Nathaniel Webb, became principal of both\r\ndepartments about 1833. Mr. Webb's influence, not only in this\r\nschool, but also in the educational interests of the entire county,\r\nwas such that he is worth of more than a cursory notice in any\r\naccount of educational matters in this county.\r\n\r\nHe was a graduate of Union College and had caught some of the\r\nenthusiasm of Dr. Nott in the cause of education. He had prepared for\r\nthe ministry, but, on the completion of his studies at Union, he\r\nfound his health so impaired that he had to give up work and spend\r\nsome time in the South, recovering his lost vitality. He never\r\nbecame robust, but enjoyed a fair degree of health and was an\r\nindefatigable worker.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the principal-ship of Farmers' Hall, Mr. Webb\r\nestablished a boarding school for young ladies at Goshen, which had,\r\nfor many years, a wide reputation and patronage. It was noted for its\r\nthoroughness, its high moral tone, and for the real culture of its\r\ngraduates. This school, which was later known as the Goshen Female\r\nSeminary, under the efficient management of Professor Webb, became\r\none of the best schools of its kind in the State, and sent out many\r\ncultured women into the homes and schools of this section.\r\n\r\nIn connection with his school work, Mr. Webb was also one of the\r\nproprietors and editorial writers of the _Democrat and Whig,_ a local\r\npaper published in Goshen, and continued his connection with that\r\npaper until the time of his death, which occurred in 1855. As an\r\neditorial writer for a political paper, he was so fair and impartial\r\nthat he frequently became the trusted friend and adviser of both\r\nsides of a political controversy and his judgment had great weight\r\non all political questions. As a teacher, as a man of affairs in both\r\nthe social and political world, as a Christian gentleman, interested\r\nin every good work in the community in which he lived and as an\r\nexemplar of true living and Christian manhood, he was a worthy\r\nexample of what the teacher should be in any community.\r\n\r\nVarious other teachers as principals and instructors carried on the\r\nwork of this school until well on in the second half of the\r\nnineteenth century, when, like most of the other private academies,\r\nit was replaced by the public school.\r\n\r\nWhatever the facts may be concerning the priority of the\r\nestablishment of Clinton Academy and the Farmers' Hall, there seems\r\nto be no doubt that the Montgomery Academy, another Orange County\r\ninstitution, incorporated in 1792, was the fourth of these schools in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThe progressive character of the people of our county is shown by\r\nthis fact, that two of the first four academies of the State should\r\nhave been founded by them. The subscription list for the Montgomery\r\nAcademy is dated in 1787 and was probably circulated and signed at\r\nthat time. The village of Montgomery was only a small hamlet in a\r\nfarming community. The people were, not wealthy, but they were in\r\nearnest in their determination to secure for their children the\r\nadvantages of a good school.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and seventy-seven names appear on the list, almost all of\r\nthem heads of families, residing within eight or ten miles of the\r\nvillage. The amounts were small individually, but the sum obtained\r\nwas sufficient for the modest beginning which they were to make. The\r\ntrustees appointed by the subscribers, to take charge of the\r\nundertaking, were thirteen in number and were generally the most\r\nprominent and intelligent men of the section.\r\n\r\nThe story of how these farmers helped themselves to what they wanted\r\nin school accommodations is told by both Eager and Ruttenber in\r\ntheir histories of Orange County. This story illustrates so well the\r\nmethod of the founding of these schools in rural communities\r\nthroughout the State that I quote from Ruttenber the story, entire:\r\n\r\n\"The trustees purchased a frame, already put up, several miles\r\ndistant, as they could get it for some small sum, made a frolic to\r\nwhich the farmers came with their teams and carted it down to the\r\nvillage. This was but the work of a day, in these patriotic and\r\nfreewill times. So, at very little expense, the building was entirely\r\nput up and finished.\r\n\r\n\"The teacher they wished to employ (the Rev. Alexander Miller, of New\r\nJersey), was married, had a family and a horse and could not come\r\nunless the family and the horse could be accommodated. So, the\r\ntrustees redoubled their exertions, built a kitchen adjoining the\r\nacademy, put up a stable and permitted the Reverend Mr. Miller to\r\nlive on the ground floor. They tendered him 80 pounds for the first\r\nyear, and, after that, all he could make. This offer was accepted and\r\nthe Reverend Mr. Miller became the first principal of the new\r\ninstitution. The tuition fees paid by the pupils varied from 2 L. to\r\n5 L. a year, according to the subjects studied.\" The pound in New\r\nYork currency was $2.50.\r\n\r\nThe old building was used about twenty years and was then replaced by\r\na substantial brick building, in which the old academy maintained its\r\nexistence for many years, after most of the private schools had been\r\nabsorbed by the public school system. In 1891, after more than a\r\nhundred years of existence as a private school, it became the\r\nacademic department of the Montgomery public schools.\r\n\r\nThe Newburgh Academy was projected by the Reverend Mr. Spierin,\r\npastor of the Episcopal church. After some delay a building was\r\nerected and a school opened \"for the instruction of youth in the\r\nGreek and Latin languages and in other branches of literature.\" The\r\npeculiar relation of this school to the Church of England and its\r\ncontrol by the trustees of the Glebe, seem to have been a source of\r\ntrouble. In 1804, a public meeting of the inhabitants of the\r\noriginal patent was held and nine trustees were elected \"to take\r\ncharge of the school in the academy.\" The new trustees evidently did\r\ntake charge, for the school was incorporated under the University of\r\nthe State of New York in 1806 as \"The Newburgh Academy.\" This school\r\nhad a long and successful career. Many of its teachers were men of\r\nlearning and ability and the school enjoyed a reputation second to\r\nnone in this section of the State. It is impossible to give its full\r\nhistory or to name all of its teachers. Mr. Ruttenber mentions Samuel\r\nNicholson as principal in 1799, James Larrimore in 1802 and a long\r\nline of successors. The academy continued its work as a private\r\nschool until the special act establishing the free schools of\r\nNewburgh was passed in 1852, when it became a part of the public\r\nschool system of the village.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Academy, of Florida, had its inception in a meeting of\r\nthe inhabitants of that village held on February 14th, 1809. The\r\nmeeting was enthusiastic and decided to erect a school building and\r\nestablish a school \"for the instruction of the young.\"\r\n\r\nA two-story brick building was erected, but it was not conducted as a\r\nprivate academy long. When, in response to the law of 1812, the towns\r\nwere divided into school districts, in 1813, the building became the\r\nschool house of District No. 15, of the town of Warwick.\r\n\r\nSamuel S. Seward was one of the first movers for the establishment of\r\nthis school and was a member of its first board of trustees. His son,\r\nWilliam H. Seward, afterward governor of the State of New York,\r\nUnited States Senator and Secretary of State under President Lincoln,\r\nwas one of its early pupils.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward was never satisfied with the fate of the Washington\r\nAcademy and later gave a site and erected a building for a private\r\nschool which was known as the S. S. Seward Institute.\r\n\r\nHe left $20,000 in his will for a permanent endowment of this school.\r\nFor nearly half a century it was maintained as a high class boarding\r\nschool. The endowment and the active interest of the Seward family\r\nkept it in operation long after most of the schools of its kind had\r\nbeen closed by the competition of the public school. But in 1891, it\r\nwas turned over to the board of education of the village of Florida\r\nand it has, since that time, been the academic department of the\r\nFlorida public schools.\r\n\r\nThe Wallkill Academy, Middletown, like a number of other places along\r\nthe line of the Erie Railroad, owes its initial development to that\r\nroad. In 1840 it was a small village. The people were alive to the\r\ninterests of their children, however, and in 1841, they organized a\r\ncompany with 115 stockholders, for the purpose of establishing an\r\nacademy to provide the children of the village with better\r\nopportunities for education than could be had in the district school.\r\nThe result of this movement was the building of a school house and\r\nthe establishment of the Wallkill Academy.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Phineas Robinson was the first teacher, and the school\r\ntook high rank as a classical or grammar school from the first.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by Patrick McGregor, who was principal for five\r\nyears. Henry Freeman was in charge for a like period, and the\r\nReverend P. Teller Babbitt was in charge for a year and half. Then D.\r\nKerr Bull became principal and continued in charge of the academy\r\nuntil it became a part of the public school system of the village of\r\nMiddletown, at its organization under special act of the legislature\r\nin 1867.\r\n\r\nThe Chester Academy was chartered by the regents of the university on\r\nFebruary 27th, 1844. The first principal was William Bross, who was\r\nassisted by his brother, Stephen D. Bross, mentioned above as one of\r\nthe principals of Farmers' Hall Academy at Goshen.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bross prepared for college at Milford, Pa., and graduated\r\nfrom Williams College in 1838. He taught in several places before\r\ngoing to Chester, and, in 1848, he went to Chicago and engaged in\r\nnewspaper work. For a number of years, he was president of the\r\nChicago Tribune Company and he was lieutenant-governor of the State\r\nof Illinois from 1865 to 1869.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Phineas Robinson, who was the first principal of\r\nWallkill Academy at Middletown, was in charge of this school for\r\neight years, and Edward Orton, who was later a professor in the Ohio\r\nState University, was principal for six years. Like the others, the\r\nChester Academy became, later, a part of the public school system,\r\nand the old academy building was used for public school purposes\r\nuntil it was burned in 1905. A new building has been erected to take\r\nits place and has been in use since September, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe Warwick Institute was organized in 1852. The building was erected\r\nin the spring of 1853 and the school opened the same year. D. F.\r\nDrew was engaged as principal but left during the first year, and was\r\nsucceeded by William A. Carter. The institute and its property were\r\nturned over to the board of education in 1868, that board agreeing to\r\nforever maintain a school for instruction in the higher studies.\r\n\r\nThe West Point Military Academy--This school, while in the county,\r\nis not of it. It is the United States government school for training\r\nofficers for the command of its armies.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy is located on a government reservation at West\r\nPoint, one of the most picturesque and beautiful spots on the Hudson.\r\nThe establishment of such a school was recommended by Washington in\r\nhis last message to Congress and it is known that even from the time\r\nof the Revolution, West Point had been looked upon by him as a most\r\nsuitable place for its location.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of Washington was acted upon and some provision\r\nmade for the instruction of cadets, but it was not until after the\r\nwar of 1812 had shown the necessity for such training, that the\r\nmilitary academy was fully established.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to the present it has grown in importance and\r\nefficiency. Many millions of dollars have been spent in utilizing the\r\nnatural advantages of the reservation and in providing the equipment\r\nneeded. The reservation contains nearly two hundred buildings of\r\nvarious kinds, and its attractiveness on account of its natural\r\nscenery, its buildings and its well-kept lawns, make it a popular\r\nplace for tourists.\r\n\r\nThe academies which I have mentioned, with the exception of the\r\nmilitary academy, which is brought in here simply because of its\r\nlocation, were of a semi-public character. While not maintained by\r\ntaxation, they were organized by popular movements and existed only\r\nfor the benefit of the people.\r\n\r\nThere have been many other schools in the county, which were entirely\r\nprivate in character. Many of these have been important factors in\r\nthe progress of education in our county, and have done much to uphold\r\na high standard of school work, but we shall be able to mention only\r\nthose which now exist and which hold charter relations with the\r\neducational system of the State.\r\n\r\n             THE PERIOD OF THE FREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThere had been elementary schools in most of the scattered\r\ncommunities of the county before the Revolution, as we have seen, and\r\nthey continued after that war, increasing in numbers and in\r\nefficiency. The academies provided better teachers for those schools,\r\nand they also stimulated the children in them to prepare themselves\r\nfor the higher studies of the academies. They were public schools\r\nalso, but they were entirely dependent upon local initiative and\r\nsupported entirely by the people of the neighborhoods in which they\r\nwere maintained. The State had shown its interest in secondary\r\neducation by the establishment of the university, in 1784, by\r\nchartering the academies and by grants of money in aid of these\r\nschools, but it was not until 1795 that it showed any interest in the\r\ncommon schools.\r\n\r\nIn that year, acting on the recommendation of Governor Clinton, the\r\nlegislature appropriated the sum of 20,000 L. ($50,000) a year, for\r\nthe succeeding five years, \"for the encouragement of the common\r\nschools.\"\r\n\r\nThe act provided, also, for the election of two commissioners of\r\nschools, in each town, of the counties of the State, to supervise the\r\nschools of the town and to make arrangements for the proper\r\ndistribution of this grant. The chaotic condition of the schools,\r\nwith no system of records and accounts, and, in some instances, the\r\nlocal pride and resentment, occasioned by this State interference in\r\nwhat was considered an entirely local institution, rendered the just\r\napportionment of this fund difficult, and, after three years it was\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 the State began the accumulation of a fund, the interest of\r\nwhich should be used to aid the public schools. This fund, to which\r\nadditions are made from year to year, now amounts to considerably\r\nover $4,000,000, and the United States deposit fund, an overflow of\r\nthe treasury of the United States, distributed to the States in\r\n1836-7, which has been reserved for school purposes, amounts to a\r\nlike sum. By the laws of 1812, the State definitely assumed control\r\nof the public schools. During the succeeding year, 1813, under the\r\nprovisions of this act, the townships, in all the counties of the\r\nState, were divided into school districts and public schools were\r\nestablished, supported partly by State aid and the balance made up by\r\na rate bill, an amount assessed upon the parents of the children\r\nattending, proportioned upon the number of days they were in\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nThe districts, as formed in Orange County, in 1813, have not greatly\r\nchanged since that date. The rate bill was continued as the method of\r\nschool support until the passage of the Free School Act, in 1853,\r\nand, in many places it was continued until 1867 when it was finally\r\nabolished and the schools, supported entirely by public funds, became\r\nfree to the children of rich and poor alike.\r\n\r\nThe supervision of the public schools by township commissioners,\r\nunder the law of 1795, and abandoned in most of the towns in 1798,\r\nwas restored by the law of 1812, and thereafter, until 1844, what\r\nsupervision of the schools there was, in the various towns, was\r\nvested in three commissioners and three inspectors. In 1844, the\r\nsupervision of the schools was vested in a town superintendent of\r\nschools and so continued until the office of school commissioner in\r\nthe assembly districts, was created in 1856. Since that time, the\r\nwork of inspection and supervision has been performed by these\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of the two assembly districts of Orange County,\r\nsince 1856, have been in the first assembly district, George K.\r\nSmith, David A. Morrison, Charles N. Gedney, Jonathan Silliman,\r\nJames M. Monell, Charles Rivenburg and George W. Flood. In the second\r\nassembly district, George N. Green, Harvey H. Clark, John J. Barr,\r\nBenjamin F. Hill, John W. Slauson, Asa Morehouse, Oliver N.\r\nGoldsmith, William H. Shaw, Ira L. Case, Willard M. Clark, William P.\r\nKaufmann.\r\n\r\nSince the operation of the free school act began, the educational\r\nprogress of the county has been continuous. The enrollment has\r\nincreased with the population. The average daily attendance has\r\nincreased more rapidly than the enrollment, and the efficiency of the\r\nschools, as indicated by the number of the institutions which are\r\ndoing academic or high school work together with the number of pupils\r\nof high school grade, shows the most marked advancement. The number\r\nof such schools in our county has increased from half a dozen to\r\ntwenty-two and the percentage of high school pupils to the enrollment\r\nhas increased from less than one per cent, to about eight per cent.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate more clearly this progress of the schools. I have\r\nprepared a table showing the population, enrollment, average\r\nattendance and high school pupils for each decade of the free\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n      Table Showing Progress of the Schools by Decades.\r\n\r\n                       1860     1870   1880   1890   1900    1906\r\n Population           63,812   80,002 88,220 97,859 103,859 108,267\r\n Enrollment           12,750   18,210 19,615 17,955  18,302  18,193\r\n Average attendance   No data   8,300 10,262 10,963  12,868  13,617\r\n In high schools      No data     129    298    320     843   1,369\r\n\r\n   The schools doing high school work in 1906 were the following:\r\n\r\n                                       Principal.

At that time, sixteen teachers\r\nwere employed and about 500 pupils were enrolled. By 1865, when\r\nNewburgh became a city, and had a population of 13,905, the average\r\nattendance had increased to nearly 1,200, and thirty-one teachers\r\nwere employed. Since that time, the growth in population has been\r\ngradual and the schools have more than kept pace with that growth.\r\n\r\nNew buildings have been erected from time to time to provide room for\r\nthe constantly increasing enrollment, until there are now seven\r\nbuildings with sittings for more than 4,000 pupils. These buildings\r\nare all fully equipped with the modern improvements and all the\r\nappliances needed for the most efficient school work.\r\n\r\nThere are 109 teachers employed and the enrollment for 1906 was\r\n4,230.\r\n\r\nThe city is doing more in the line of manual training than is done in\r\nany other part of the county. A five years' course is given the boys\r\nwho reach the higher grammar grades and the girls, from the third to\r\nthe sixth year, are taught to sew.\r\n\r\nThe following superintendents have had charge of the schools of the\r\ncity since 1852:\r\n\r\n    Nathaniel Jones         1852-57\r\n    Hugh Banks              1857-59\r\n    Dr. R.

K. Montfort   1887-1900\r\n    James M. Crane          1900\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Middletown Schools--The school system of the city of Middletown\r\nwas organized under a special act of the legislature passed in 1867.\r\nAt that time, about 500 pupils were enrolled in all the schools. The\r\nschools have grown with the growth of the city, making necessary the\r\nerection of new buildings at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\nThere are now eight school buildings, all built of brick, well\r\ndistributed for the convenience of the pupils attending and\r\nexcellently adapted to the needs of the city. The new high school\r\nbuilding is the finest and most costly school building in the county.\r\nSixty-two teachers were employed in 1906, and the number of pupils\r\nenrolled was 2,557.\r\n\r\nThe following named gentlemen have been the superintendents of the\r\nschools since their organization:\r\n\r\n    A. V. N. Powelson    1867-69\r\n    A. H. Farnham        1869-70\r\n    Hiram Warren         1870-74\r\n    Henry R. Sanford     1874-85\r\n    George T. Church     1885-86\r\n    A. B. Wilbur         1886-91\r\n    James F. Tuthill     1891\r\n\r\nThe Middletown schools have a reputation for excellent work and the\r\nschool rooms, especially those in the new high school, are models of\r\nconvenience and furnishing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Port Jervis Schools--The village of Port Jervis came into being\r\nsoon after the completion of the Delaware and Hudson Canal and took\r\nits name from that of the engineer in charge of that work.\r\n\r\nIt was only a small hamlet, however, until the building of the Erie\r\nRailroad, near the middle of the last century. In 1850, there were\r\nonly 270 children of school age in the district. The coming of the\r\nrailroad caused a rapid increase in population and by 1853, the date\r\nof the free school act, the number had increased to 562. It was not\r\nuntil 1862 that the district was organized under the general law as\r\nUnion Free School District Number One of the town of Deerpark. By\r\n1866, the number of children of school age had increased to 1,816.\r\n\r\nThe high school was organized in 1863, with David Beatty as teacher.\r\nThis school was admitted under the Regents in 1867. There are\r\nforty-nine teachers employed and an enrollment of over 2,000 pupils.\r\n\r\nThere are six buildings used for school purposes, three of them\r\nsubstantial brick buildings, constructed within the past few years.\r\nA very noticeable feature of the schools in Port Jervis is the large\r\nenrollment in proportion to the population. More than 20 per cent, of\r\nthe entire population was registered in the public schools, and more\r\nthan one-ninth of this registration was in the high school in 1906.\r\n\r\nThe superintendents of the schools, in Port Jervis. since their\r\norganization in 1862, have been:\r\n\r\n    K. W. Manning          1862-63\r\n    David Beatty           1863-65\r\n    Isaac M. Wellington    1865-69\r\n    Edward A. Kingsley     1869-70\r\n    A. B. Wilbur           1870-83\r\n    F. W. Best             1883-84\r\n    J. M. Dolph            1884\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the courtesy of School Commissioners George W. Flood, of the First\r\nAssembly District and William P. Kaufmann of the Second, and of the\r\nSuperintendents of schools in Newburgh and Middletown, I am permitted\r\nto present the principal facts of the school reports for the year\r\n1907.\r\n\r\n                Abstract of School Reports for 1907.\r\n\r\n                 School Number Children of Entire  Average Expendi-\r\n              Buildings  of    School Age  Enroll- Attend- tures\r\n                        Teach- in  Dis-     ment    ance   for All\r\n                         ers   trict                       School\r\n                                                           Purposes\r\n Newburgh City        7  110     5,773     4,257   3,291  $101,577.97\r\n Middletown City      8   64     2,648     2,440   1,962    65,457.29\r\n Blooming Grove Town 10   16       463       503     299     8,188.70\r\n Cornwall             7   26     1,014       971     704    23,541.76\r\n Crawford            11   13       276       305     230     4,983.17\r\n Hamptonburgh         6    7       249       230     145     3,368.36\r\n Highland             3   19       843       730     593    17,666.24\r\n Monroe               5   14       491       515     360    10,653.14\r\n Montgomery          13   34     1,337     1,394     852    24,593.10\r\n Newburgh            13   19       753       724     447    12,228.41\r\n New Windsor          8   11       421       352     189     4,911.79\r\n Chester              5   14       461       461     365    19,549.67\r\n Deerpark            14   60     2,358     2,369   1,754    45,553.98\r\n Goshen              11   20       701       691     463    14,847.64\r\n Greenville           7    7       148       173      79     2,717.39\r\n Minisink             8   10       262       335     185     5,181.39\r\n Mount Hope           5    6       250       250     120     2,952.37\r\n Tuxedo               6   16       618       615     416    17,140.34\r\n Wallkill            18   18       498       511     300     7,175.70\r\n Wawayanda           10   10       276       299     171     4,204.28\r\n Norwich             18   36     1,336     1,374     950    28,387.84\r\n Woodbury             5    9       314       300     221     6,618.42\r\n                   ____  ____   ______    ______  ______   __________\r\n                    198  530    21,490    19,707  14,086  $431,499.39\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rev. Francis Washburn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCHES OF ORANGE COUNTY.\r\n\r\nBy Rev. Francis Washburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prevailing religion of Orange County is still nominally\r\nChristian, differentiated in forms of worship and principles of\r\nfaith. As yet few representatives of other religions have formed any\r\nsettlement within its boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe organized religious bodies are numerous and strong, exercising\r\nstill against many adverse agencies a controlling influence over the\r\nlives of the people. Those first established in the county in the\r\nColonial epoch still maintain the predominance they then secured.\r\nAlthough the confessions of faith of some of them have been modified\r\nsomewhat, yet they all with a few minor exceptions hold to the creeds\r\nApostolic and Nicene. With more general diffusion of education\r\namongst the people has come to prevail a more genial and less\r\ndogmatic form of enunciating the great truths of the Gospel of\r\nChrist. The churches or associations of religious people are becoming\r\nmore conservative of all that is good and wholesome for human beings\r\nboth here and hereafter.\r\n\r\nFaith in the parental love of God the Father, and brotherly love of\r\nChrist are being taught by the Church of Christ as the mother of the\r\nworld's children and the bride of Christ, whose spirit is more and\r\nmore the atmosphere of a heavenly home for us all. The ministry of\r\nthe church is coming to be a ministry over us everywhere in all\r\nplaces and at all times. She is extending her work of sponsorship\r\ninto every sphere of human activity. And the time seems to be\r\nrapidly approaching when she will guard us all from the cradle to the\r\ngrave from every agency of ill that would deprive us of the love and\r\napprobation of God.\r\n\r\nThe different religious bodies bearing the name of Christian are all\r\nseeking the good of humankind, animated by the same spirit which\r\nactuated the Christ when He went to Golgotha and when He ascended at\r\nOlivet. They are agreed in their aim and are united in their\r\nsympathy. They work in agreement and will not contend with each\r\nother. Christian charity to-day is prevailing to the elimination of\r\ndenominational pride.\r\n\r\nThe Christians of Orange County are becoming assimilated to the\r\nspirit of those on whom the Holy Ghost fell in the day of Pentecost.\r\nFor years since the earliest settlement of this country they have\r\nbeen known as Presbyterians, Lutherans, Reformed Dutch,\r\nEpiscopalians, Roman Catholics, Baptists, Methodists, Quakers, etc.,\r\nand are still connected with organizations bearing these names, but\r\nthey are coming to bear in their membership the same characteristic\r\ndevotion to humanity and God.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be to-day what our ancestors were who came from Europe.\r\nThey were unaware of a vast deal we know. Their knowledge of the\r\nworld and its peoples was infinitely little, ours is infinitely\r\nlarge. They came and settled here amid dense forests and interpreted\r\nGod's word by and through their limited experience, but God's word to\r\nthem was a sealed book; they could not interpret it at all. They came\r\nfrom different countries of Western Europe, and brought with them\r\ntheir theories religious and secular. The Dutch came to the mouth of\r\na great stream that ran north, and settled on an island, and called\r\ntheir settlement New Amsterdam. Some of them sailed up this great\r\nriver, now known as the Hudson, and established homes in the\r\nneighborhood of the present city of Kingston, at the confluence of\r\ntwo streams, known to us as the Wallkill and Rondout. Their\r\nexpression of the Christian religion exists in their descendants\r\nto-day as the Reformed, known to me in my boyhood as the Dutch\r\nReformed. The churches of this denomination in Orange County owe\r\ntheir origin to the missionary zeal of Rev. Petrus Vas and the Rev.\r\nGeorge W. Marcius, pastors of the church at Kingston. The _Montgomery\r\nReformed Church_ was first organized as the _German Reformed Church\r\nof the Wallkill_ in 1782. The _Warwick Church_ was organized October\r\n24, 1694, at Orangetown. In 1764 its congregation united with the\r\nPresbyterians, and remained thus united until 1803, when the\r\ncongregation determined that as the deed of the property was to the\r\nPresbyterians it should continue to be held by them as trustees,\r\nwhile the Reformed Dutch Consistory should control the spiritual\r\ninterests. At the present time there are ten churches of this type in\r\nthe county, as follows:\r\n\r\n Location.         Pastor.           Membership.\r\n\r\n Newburgh          A. T. Brook       308\r\n Walden            W. W. Schomp      420\r\n Montgomery        Peter Crispell    312\r\n Port Jervis, 1st  Willard Conger    418\r\n Port Jervis, 2nd  J. B.

Whitney      70\r\n Unionville        Vacant             20\r\n                                  ______\r\n                   Total           2,223\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds if not thousands of people living in this county\r\nto-day, who do not understand why there are so many Christian\r\nsocieties bearing different names and worshiping apart. There are\r\nalmost as many, in all probability who are ignorant of the doctrines\r\nwherein they differ from other Christian bodies.\r\n\r\nThe last generation arriving at adult age has heard so infrequently\r\ndoctrinal and controversial preaching as to know not why they are of\r\none denomination rather than another. On this line the men who\r\nestablished Presbyterian bodies in this county, away back in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, were well informed.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the Presbyterians of the various schools are\r\nequally beyond the knowledge of the great majority. I am not going to\r\nattempt to enlighten myself or my readers by any research of old\r\npamphlets, etc., of the Presbyterian denomination. Life is too short\r\nand the matter too immaterial to the issue in which we are\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nIn 1752, says Ruttenber, the Associate Presbytery of Scotland sent\r\nthe Rev. John Culbertson to America, who organized in the Wallkill\r\nvalley a praying society in 1753, which eventually became the\r\n_Reformed Presbyterian Church_ at Coldenham.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 or 1817 a praying society established in Newburgh became the\r\nfirst _Presbyterian Church_ there.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 the _Associated Reformed Church_ of Little Britain and\r\nNeelytown began their corporate existence.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the _Graham Church_ of Crawford, organized in 1800, united\r\nwith the church at Hamptonburgh.\r\n\r\nThe first _Associate Reformed Church_ of Newburgh was organized in\r\n1797, and the _Union Associate Reformed_ in 1837.\r\n\r\nThe _Presbyterian Church_ at Goshen was the first of this\r\ndenomination established in Orange County. Its first edifice stood at\r\nthe site now occupied by the Court House.\r\n\r\nThe second _Presbyterian Church_ was that at Goodwill. It was\r\noriginally established for the use of immigrants principally from\r\nCounty Londonderry, Ireland. Its first pastor was Rev. John Houston.\r\nOut of this organization rose not less than five others, namely:\r\nNeelytown, Hamptonburgh, Hopewell, Graham, Berea and Montgomery. Its\r\nfirst house of worship is said to have been erected in 1735.\r\n\r\nThe third _Presbyterian Church of Cornwall_ at Bethlehem, was\r\norganized in 1730. From it sprang into existence the first\r\n_Presbyterian Church_ of Newburgh, and the first of New Windsor (now\r\ndefunct).\r\n\r\nThe following statement was prepared by the Rev. Charles O.

In the\r\nlatter half of the eighteenth century some of them who had come to\r\nOrange County, organized as a church society in Coldenham, and called\r\nas pastor, Rev. Dr. Alexander McLeod, who afterward became famous as\r\na preacher in New York City. For five years, from 1812, Rev. James\r\nMulligan was pastor, and he was followed by the eloquent J. R.\r\nWilliams, who delivered the famous address at Goshen when the bones\r\nof the patriots who fell in the battle of Minisink were buried. The\r\npresent pastor is Rev. Thomas Patton.\r\n\r\nA society of Reformed Presbyterians was formed in Newburgh in 1802,\r\nand services were held for a time at the residence of James Clarke.\r\nThis was a part of the Coldenham congregation until 1824, when it was\r\norganized as a separate society and called for its first pastor Rev.\r\nJ. R. Johnston, who afterward joined the _Presbyterian Church._ The\r\npresent pastor, Rev. J. W. V. Carlisle, is the successor of his\r\nfather, who died in 1887.\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1854, a second Reformed Presbyterian society was\r\norganized in Newburgh, which is known as the _Westminster Church._ It\r\nhas had but one pastor, Rev. J. R. Thompson, whose ministrations in\r\nDecember, 1907, had extended through the long period of fifty-two\r\nyears. He has said of his church: \"The motto of Harvard College is\r\n'Pro Christo et Ecclesia'; but that of Reformed Presbyterians is,\r\n'Pro Christo et Ecclesia et Patria.' Their aim is to Christianize the\r\nNational government as well as the church.\"\r\n\r\n_The Protestant Episcopal Church._ This branch of the Church\r\nCatholic now represented in Orange County is shown by the following\r\nstatistical report. A brief general history of the Protestant\r\nEpiscopal Church may be appreciated. Prior and up to the war of\r\nIndependence, there were several places in the county where worship\r\nwas maintained by the Church of England Society, for the propagation\r\nof the gospel in foreign parts, namely, at Newburgh on the Glebe,\r\ngranted to them by King George; at St. David's in the vicinity of the\r\npresent village of Washingtonville, and at St. Andrews west of\r\nNewburgh some twelve miles.\r\n\r\nThe success of the colonists in the above war took these and other\r\nchurches from the jurisdiction of the Church of England. To meet the\r\nnew situation measures were immediately taken by the ordained clergy\r\nof the colonies, who had accepted the results of the Revolutionary\r\nWar for the restoration of the government and worship of that church.\r\nThe church in the United States was without a head, that is to say\r\nwithout a Bishop. Those who constituted it could not continue without\r\nsuch. All English Bishops were so sworn to the Crown of England that\r\nthey were unable to act in an independent state such as this. No\r\npriest could be elevated to the office of Bishop in England without\r\nsubscribing to the following article, _i. e._ That the King's Majesty\r\nunder God is the only Supreme Governor of this realm and of all other\r\nof His Highness's dominions and countries as well as in all\r\nspiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes as temporal. In the\r\nAmerican church no ordination or confirmations could take place. In\r\n1780 a conference of the clergy and laity assembled at the call of\r\nthe Rev. Dr. William Smith, president of Washington College. The\r\npurpose was to unite the separated parts into a body corporate. A\r\nsecond conference was called in 1783. There were present at this\r\neighteen clergymen.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolutionary War closed there were in Connecticut forty\r\nEpiscopal congregations, fourteen clergymen and forty thousand\r\nmembers, ten of the fourteen met at Woodbury in Litchfield County,\r\nand chose two men either of whom they thought would be suitable for\r\nthe office of Bishop, namely, the Rev. Dr. Jeremiah Leaming, and\r\nSamuel Seabury. Dr. Seabury accepted, went to England and laid before\r\nthe Bishop his credentials submitting to him the fact which in the\r\njudgment of the Connecticut people made the appointment of an\r\nAmerican Bishop an immediate necessity. In case of failure in England\r\nhe was to go to Scotland and endeavor to secure consecration of the\r\nnon-juring Bishops. To these Bishops Seabury was finally compelled to\r\nresort for consecration. In a private chapel of a modest house in\r\nAberdine he was consecrated by Robert Kilgour, Arthur Petrie and John\r\nSkinner. He came home to America the first Bishop of the church here.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1784, at a meeting held in New Brunswick, N. Y., by the\r\nmanagers of the society for the relief of the widows and orphans of\r\nclergymen the general condition of the church came up for discussion,\r\nthe result of which was a call for a conference of churchmen from all\r\nthe States to be held in October. It met. There were present\r\ndelegates from Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia and Connecticut. A call was issued summoning the\r\nchurches in the several States to send delegates to a constitutional\r\nconvention. This was held in Philadelphia on St. Michael's Day in\r\n1785, with the following result: A constitution for the church.\r\nHaving made it they proceeded to consider the Episcopate; they drew\r\nup an address to the Archbishop and Bishops of England. Upon the\r\nreceipt of the answer they met in October, 1786, for its\r\nconsideration. In reply they informed the English Bishops that the\r\nNicene and Apostles' Creeds were retained and that in fact the\r\nEnglish prayer book was kept intact. They then called the roll of\r\nStates present to ascertain if any had chosen men for Bishops. New\r\nYork delegates presented the name of Dr. Provoost. Pennsylvania\r\npresented the name of White. Maryland had already chosen Dr. Smith.\r\nWhite and Provoost went to England and were consecrated in Lambeth\r\nChapel, February 4, 1786. On their return to this country they were\r\nmet by the Bishop of Connecticut and with him consulted on terms of\r\nunion. The result of their deliberation was the adoption of\r\nresolutions which it was thought would harmonize both sides. In these\r\nresolutions they recognized the validity of Seabury's consecration\r\nand that together with Provoost and White they had all the power\r\nwhich belongs to the Episcopal office limited only by such canons or\r\nlaws as the entire church of the United States might fix. They then\r\nadjourned to meet again in Connecticut in convention of the whole\r\nchurch. When the constitution was altered, the Bishops became a\r\nseparate house, the other house was to be composed of representatives,\r\nlay and clerical (not Bishops). They also revised the English prayer\r\nbook to make it harmonize with the government of these States. These\r\nthings being satisfactorily adjusted the organization of the\r\nProtestant Episcopal church of the United States of North America\r\nbecame an established fact.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant Episcopal churches of this section, with those of\r\nother sections of New York State, first came under the superintendence\r\nof Bishop Samuel Provoost, Rector of _Trinity Parish_ in the city of\r\nNew York; at which time, _St. Andrews Parish,_ Walden, then in Ulster\r\nCounty and _St. George's,_ Newburgh, were the only ones surviving the\r\nravages of the Revolutionary period. These churches with _St. David's_\r\nhad been organized under an act of incorporation granted by King\r\nGeorge the Third, dated July 23, 1770, at which time the Rev. John\r\nSayre was in charge of missionary work at Newburgh and parts adjacent.\r\n\r\nThere do not appear to have been any Episcopal duties performed in\r\neither Ulster or Orange Counties until 1700, from the time of the\r\nsuperintendency of Bishop Provoost when Rev. George H. Spierin\r\nbecame the minister and schoolmaster of St. George's Glebe School and\r\nChurch in Newburgh and the rector of _St. Andrews,_ Walden. There is\r\nno record of any visitations of the parishes by Provoost.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 when Rev. Frederick Van Horn was rector of _St. Andrew's,_ it\r\nand _St. George's_ were members of the Diocesan convention. Bishop\r\nMoore was then in charge of the diocese. During his Episcopate _St.\r\nJames' Church,_ Goshen, was received into union with the convention,\r\n1808, and _Christ's Church,_ Warwick, 1804. Although there are no\r\nrecords of any Episcopal visitations in this section of the State\r\nthere probably were such. February, 1816, Bishop Moore died, and was\r\nsucceeded by Bishop John Henry Hobart, who became the third Bishop of\r\nNew York. _Trinity Church,_ from which the bishops were selected down\r\nto the time of Bishop Horatio Potter, furnished not only the Bishops\r\nbut the financial means for the maintenance of church work throughout\r\nthe whole country. The Episcopal Church in the United States, when\r\nDr. Hobart assumed Episcopal jurisdiction, was apparently dying. He\r\nrevived hope in the hearts of its adherents. With him the church\r\nbegan to live and grow. He established a Churchman's magazine in New\r\nYork, provided for a learned clergy by establishing a college at\r\nGeneva, did much for the endowment of the college in New York and was\r\nalso the real founder of the Theological Seminary there. It was while\r\nhe was bishop that the Rev. John Brown became rector of _St. George's\r\nParish,_ Newburgh (1816) and _St. Thomas',_ New Windsor, 1818.\r\n\r\nThe original diocese of New York is now divided into five. The names\r\nof successful Bishops of New York from Hobart's time to this are\r\nRight Rev. Treadwell Onderdonk, who was consecrated in 1830; Bishop\r\nWainwright, Bishop Horatio Potter, Bishop Henry C. Potter and Bishop\r\nGreer. In 1838 the diocese of western New York was created. _Grace\r\nChurch,_ Middletown, was organized under Onderdonk's Episcopate.\r\nDuring which also the Rev. Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright was consecrated\r\nto perform the Episcopal duties in the diocese provisionally. Bishop\r\nWainwright died on the feast of St. Matthew, Thursday, September\r\n21st, 1854, in the sixty-third year of his age. Dr. Horatio Potter\r\nbecame Bishop, November 22, 1854, and served provisionally until the\r\ndeath of Bishop Onderdonk in 1861, and wholly from that time until\r\nthe twelfth day of September, 1883, when he withdrew, having\r\nfaithfully served the church as Bishop of New York for twenty-nine\r\nyears. His Episcopate was the most successful and satisfactory from\r\nthe beginning; Hobart's was brilliant, but his was masterful and\r\ncomplete. He was a great man, master of himself and others. He ruled\r\nwith ease and equity the variant elements that composed the ministry\r\nand membership of the church. With clear perception of character he\r\nindulged idiosyncrasies in men whom he saw were sincere and earnest.\r\nA perfect gentleman, a true Christian, a sound churchman, unobtrusive\r\nand inoffensive. He handed the administration of the church to his\r\nsuccessor affluent and strong, socially, spiritually, intellectually\r\nand financially. He was succeeded by his nephew, the Right Rev. Henry\r\nC. Potter. When he resigned his diocese there were in Orange County\r\nthe following flourishing parishes: _St. George's,_ Newburgh; _St.\r\nPauls,_ Newburgh; _St. John's,_ Canterbury; _St. James',_ Goshen;\r\n_Grace Church,_ Middletown; _St. Andrew's_ Walden; _St. John's,_\r\nArden; _St. George's Mission,_ Newburgh; _Grace Church,_ Monroe.\r\nUnder the present administration of his successor the growth of the\r\nchurch in this county has been continuous since 1904, being greatly\r\naided by the Right Rev. David Hummel Greer, D.D., L.L.D., Bishop\r\ncoadjutor. Orange County is united for missionary work with Sullivan\r\nCounty and Ulster County under the Rev. W. R. Thomas, D.D., Rector of\r\nHighland Falls, Arch-Deacon.\r\n\r\n              THE PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n_Grace Church,_ Monroe. Minister in charge, J. H.

George W. Grinton, secretary of the New York Conference,\r\nreports that there are at present thirty-six churches of this\r\ndenomination in Orange County, with a total membership of 5,900.\r\nDetailed reference to each appears in the various town histories of\r\nthis publication.\r\n\r\nMethodism began its existence on this continent and in this county,\r\ncontemporaneously with the Republic of the United States, John\r\nWesley, the founder of it, began his zealous propaganda in England,\r\namong the un-churched masses, in the year 1739, the year that\r\nWhitefield began his second tour of America. Independent of any\r\neffort of his, the first society of Methodists was formed in the city\r\nof New York by some of the German Palatines from Ireland. At the\r\nconference held by Wesley, at London, in 1770, two letters were\r\nreceived from New York reporting a society there of about one hundred\r\nmembers and a chapel.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 Wesley appointed Cooke superintendent of the Methodist\r\nsocieties in the United States, giving the following reasons for\r\ndoing so--\"that as the Revolution had separated the United States\r\nfrom the mother country and the Episcopal establishment was utterly\r\nabolished in the States it became his duty as providently at the head\r\nof the Methodist societies to obey their demand and furnish them the\r\nmeans of Grace. Recognized as their founder by the American\r\nMethodists; required by them to provide for their new necessities,\r\nand unable to induce the English prelates to do so, he ordained Cooke\r\nthat he might go to America and ordain preachers.\" Cooke arrived in\r\nAmerica and \"ordained\" Francis Ashbury first, as a presbyter and\r\nfinally as a superintendent. Says Stevens, the Methodist historian:\r\n\"The Colonial English Church being dissolved by the Revolution, its\r\nfragments were yet floating as had been the Methodist societies amid\r\nthe stirring tide of events. When Ashbury began his superintendency\r\nthere was small membership and but a few itinerant preachers. When he\r\ndied there were seven hundred itinerants, 2,000 local preachers and\r\n240,000 lay members.\"\r\n\r\nThe first services held in this country by a Methodist itinerant,\r\nMr. Cooper, was held in the house of Colonel Daniel McCauley at\r\nWarwick in 1706. The second at that of Mrs. A. Smith, a sister of the\r\ncolonel, situated at Middlehope. Mr. Cooper also visited John Woolsey\r\nnear Milton. Six weeks later, accompanied by a Mr. John McCloskey,\r\nJohn Cooper passed through the same section, going as far north as\r\nNew Paltz, holding services at the homes of Hendrick Deyo and\r\nAndries Du Bois.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 Ezekiel Cooper visited the town of Newburgh and held\r\nreligious services at Samuel Fowler's in Middlehope, where he\r\nestablished a preaching station which remained such until 1813.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 the Methodist Conference established the Flanders circuit,\r\nwhich embraced a portion of this county, and put James O. Cooper in\r\ncharge, with Jesse Lee, Orin Hutchins and John Lee as assistants.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 the circuit of Newburgh was created, with James D. Cromwell\r\nas presiding elder, and Nathaniel B. Mills and Andrew Humphrey as\r\npreachers. The following classes composed the circuit:\r\n\r\nSamuel Fowler, Middlehope; Munson Wards, Fostertown; Jacob Daytons,\r\nLattingtown; Mr. Schultz, Dolsentown; Mr. Warwick, Warwick; Luff\r\nSmith, Marlborough; Daniel Stephens, in the Clove; Richard Garrison,\r\nin the Clove; Elnathan Foster, Newburgh; Daniel Holmes, Middlehope;\r\nSamuel Wyatts, Keytown; Winslow Allison, Pochunk; John Ellisons, New\r\nWindsor; Daniel Ostrander, Plattekill; Samuel Ketcham, Sugar Loaf.\r\n\r\nThe first class to be organized (1807) as a church was the one at\r\nVail's Gate under the name of the _Union M. E. Church of New\r\nWindsor._ In 1819 the Newburgh circuit was divided and another\r\ncircuit created, including the societies at Bethel, Bloomingburgh,\r\nMiddletown, Montgomery, Walden, Burlingham, Sam's Point and Walker\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Sugar Loaf circuit came into existence. This embraced Sugar\r\nLoaf, Florida, Ellenville, Bellevale, Chester. Monroe, Oxford,\r\nSatterlytown, Washingtonville, Blagg's Corner, Highland Mills, Little\r\nLong Pond and Greenwood Lake.\r\n\r\n                  THE BAPTIST CHURCHES.\r\n\r\nThe Baptist denomination, we are informed by Dr. A. R Fuller of the\r\n_First Baptist Church,_ Newburgh, N. Y., has at the present time,\r\nMarch, 1907, eleven churches. One in Cornwall, Unionville, Port\r\nJervis, Warwick, Walden, Maybrook, two in Middletown and three in\r\nNewburgh. It has church property valued at $162,500.\r\n\r\nThe first minister of this persuasion to preach its tenets in the\r\ncounty was Mr. Halstead, pastor of a society at Fishkill, Dutchess\r\nCounty. April 24, 1790, a society was organized in Newburgh. In 1806\r\nanother society erected a place of worship at Luptondale, and\r\nestablished a burying ground.\r\n\r\nThe Baptist congregation at Warwick originated with the settlers from\r\nConnecticut. These organized what has since been known as the Old\r\nSchool Baptist Body. The first place of worship was erected on what\r\nis now the junction of the road leading from the village of Warwick,\r\nand the road leading from the Welling schoolhouse to Bellevale. In\r\n1809 and 1810 the society bought land in Warwick, and erected the\r\nbuilding which it now occupies.\r\n\r\n                      THE LUTHERAN CHURCHES.\r\n\r\nThe Lutheran churches are _St. Peters,_ Port Jervis, and _St.\r\nPaul's,_ Newburgh. This society was founded by the immigrants from\r\nthe Palatine, who were sent here in the reign of Queen Anne.\r\n\r\n                      THE UNITARIAN CHURCH.\r\n\r\nA Unitarian church, named the _Church of Our Father,_ was organized\r\nat Fishkill-on-the-Hudson in 1847, at a private residence. The first\r\nmeetings were held at the De Witt homestead, and afterward in the\r\npublic hall of the village. The congregation included men and women\r\nof culture, public spirit and unquestioned high character. It was\r\nministered to by such men of repute for ability and piety as Revs.\r\nWilliam H. Channing, Edward Turner, F. A. Farley and H. W. Bellows\r\namong others. Occasional services were held at Low Point,\r\nChanningville and other points in the neighborhood of Fishkill for\r\neight years. About 1855, in consequence of the increasing attendance\r\nfrom Newburgh, the church was reorganized in that city, where\r\nservices were held in the court house and the Universalist church,\r\nand there was preaching by some of the ablest ministers of the\r\ndenomination. There were so many accessions to the church that in\r\n1869 a committee was chosen to consider the subject of building a\r\nhouse of worship. This consisted of William W. Carson, John Heron,\r\nGeorge Lamey, Benjamin Dumville, George H. Southard, J. N. Dichey,\r\nGeorge W. Peters and William Stocker. Warren Delano was afterwards\r\nadded, and made chairman. The deliberations and resulting efforts\r\nbrought about the erection of the present building at a cost of\r\n$16,000, and it was consecrated in 1870. The first pastor was Rev.\r\nF. W. Holland, and the present pastor is Rev. Alson H. Robinson.\r\n\r\n                 THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH IN ORANGE.\r\n\r\nThe first Catholic missions in Orange County seem to have been\r\nestablished in 1817 and 1818. The Rev. Dr. French came in 1817, and\r\nthe Rev. Father Langdill arrived about a year later.\r\n\r\nThe first Catholic church, _St. Patrick's,_ was organized at Newburgh\r\nin 1826, and the parochial school in connection with that church was\r\nstarted soon afterward.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Roman Catholicism in this State during the\r\ncolonial period is fraught with much interest. The history of these\r\ninitial efforts covers the incidents of the French and Indian wars,\r\nbeginning in 1687 and terminating in the French domination of Canada.\r\nEven as far back as 1608, the work was begun among some of the\r\nnorthern Indian tribes. But the conversion of the Six Nations met\r\nwith little success until after the accession of James II to the\r\nEnglish throne. He instructed the province governors to aid the\r\nFrench missionaries and grant them every facility in the prosecution\r\nof their work.\r\n\r\nBut these privileges were also used to advance their national cause\r\namong the Iroquois, and the King was compelled to modify his zeal for\r\nthe propagation of the Catholic faith, which he professed.\r\n\r\nThis policy of the English government was entirely changed, however,\r\non the accession of William and Mary. Trade with the Indians had been\r\nseriously affected by the influence of these French priests, and the\r\nalliance between the English and the Iroquois was greatly weakened in\r\nconsequence. Even the toleration of Catholicism was now forbidden;\r\nnot from any hostility to the faith in itself, but for political\r\nreasons which affected the nation and its interests. Severe measures\r\nof repression were adopted. Catholic priests who came into the\r\nprovinces voluntarily were subject to the death penalty.\r\n\r\nThis practically was the state of affairs until after the breaking\r\nout of the Revolutionary War. Then, by the terms of the first State\r\nconstitution, freedom of opinion was permitted to all who subscribed\r\nto the oath of allegiance. When Ireland was appealed to for aid in\r\nthe war, and the subsequent assistance of Catholic France was asked,\r\nthe prejudices of the people were materially affected. This made it\r\npossible to engraft upon the federal constitution of 1787 the full\r\nand complete equality of all religious faiths. This of course opened\r\nthe door to Catholicism, and yet the church authorities seem to have\r\nmade little effort to extend their faith until after the Irish\r\nrebellion of 1798. Then the Catholic immigrants began to arrive in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe first priest stationed in New York City was the Rev. Charles\r\nWhalen, an Irish Franciscan, who had been a chaplain in the French\r\nfleet. He settled here after the war, and his brother, Dr. Joseph\r\nWhalen, purchased a plot of land from the Schuyler patent in\r\nMontgomery in April, 1788. The Rev. Luke Concanen was the first\r\nBishop of New York, but he died before entering upon his duties. The\r\nRev. John Conelly, his successor, was consecrated in 1814. And the\r\nfirst thing he did was to establish missions in the Hudson River\r\nvalley. He is said to have sought \"to prevent the children of\r\nCatholics conforming to the persuasions of their neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nORANGE COUNTY AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\nBy David A. Morrison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success and well-being of the American farmer is always a matter\r\nof vital concern to the entire country. The agricultural interest of\r\nany country, any State, or any county, being the fundamental\r\ncondition upon which all other branches of human effort are based and\r\nmust depend, is therefore of paramount concern to all classes.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Orange in 1899 the figures of the national census\r\nshow there were 13,584 acres devoted to corn, which yielded 589,730\r\nbushels of this cereal that year. Two thousand eight hundred and\r\nforty-four acres were sown to wheat and 42,430 bushels were gathered.\r\nThe acreage of rye was 4,453, and the total yield was 79,980 bushels.\r\nOats were grown upon 5,156 acres and the product was 126,540 bushels.\r\nOne thousand three hundred and eighty-three acres were in buckwheat,\r\nand the pancake crop that year was 23,640 bushels.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in the rural population of Orange County homes is\r\nsmaller than most other counties of the State, and the depreciation\r\nof farm lands is not so apparent. In fact the general property\r\nvaluation of the county seems to be increasing something like two and\r\none-half million dollars per year, being rated at $43,804,861.40 for\r\n1907.\r\n\r\nThe population of the county, according to the State enumeration of\r\n1905, was 107,267. This was an increase over the report of the\r\nnational census for 1900 of 3,408. Of this number, 41,014 lived in\r\nthe cities of Newburgh and Middletown. In 1880 the county ranked\r\neleventh in the State for population, ninth in the value of its\r\nfarms, and third in the value of its farm buildings. It was second in\r\nthe yield of hay, second also in corn, and third in wheat and\r\npotatoes. In the dairy department it stood right at the head, being\r\nfirst in cows and also in the average yield per cow. Even in its\r\nproduction of wool the county had fourth place.\r\n\r\nSamuel W. Eager, the early and conscientious historian of Orange\r\nCounty, speaking of the agricultural aspect of the county in 1847,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The soil is above medium character for all agricultural purposes,\r\nand while the agriculture of the county is above mediocrity, the soil\r\nmay be considered worn out and exhausted, as respects growing large\r\nor profitable crops of wheat, without manuring too expensively. That\r\narticle must be purchased of the western farmer, who yet drives his\r\nploughshare through a strong and virgin soil. That this crop must be\r\nabandoned for the present, and the land employed to raise grass, or\r\nother grains, is a dictate of common sense, and we trust our farmers\r\nare wise enough to see it, and not struggle in an unequal contest\r\nagainst the easy culture and large crops of the West.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this advice was doubtless justified, statistics show it was not\r\nfollowed. The wheat crop of 1874 was greater than that of 1840, and\r\nthe yield per acre was better under the improved culture. No attempt\r\nis made to compete with the vast wheat fields of the far West in the\r\nproduction of this great staple grain, which in fact is only grown to\r\na very limited extent in this county to-day.\r\n\r\nSmall fruits, peaches, apples and other orchard fruits are\r\nextensively grown in some parts of the county, especially in the\r\nupper river section, about Newburgh and Cornwall. The peach industry\r\nbegan in the Newburgh district about 1880, and in the Pine Island\r\nsection about 1895, and for a time some fine crops were gathered when\r\nthe winters were not too severe. But of late the orchards are less\r\npromising because of the devastations of the San Jose scale, which,\r\ntogether with the severe winters, make peach growing a precarious\r\nbusiness in this section. The leaf curl and peach yellows are other\r\ndiscouraging features, and it takes an intelligent and industrious\r\ngrower to succeed in the business. He must spray and spray, and also\r\ndig the borers from the base of the tree trunks diligently.\r\n\r\nAmong the largest peach growers in the Warwick, New Milford and Pine\r\nIsland districts are E. G. Stiebeling, 6,000 trees; J. B. Rhodes,\r\n4,000; J. R. Feagles, 4,000; Harvey Vail, 6,000; E. D. Waterbury,\r\n3,000; J. C. Drew, 2,000; G. W. Hyatt, 6,000; W. S. Layton, 4,000;\r\nHenry Demorest, 4,000; Barry Walch, 3,000; Henry Patton, 2,000;\r\nThomas Willing, 2,000; H. F. Wheeler, 2,000; Knapp & Husted, 1,500;\r\nGeorge Benedict, 1,000; J. E. Sanford, 2,000. Florida District: J. O.\r\nGable, 3,000; H. D. Jessup, 3,000; Charles Jessup, 3,000; John\r\nHouston, 2,000; E. Lovett, 2,000. Chester District: E. N. Demorest,\r\n2,000. The largest fruit growers in the Middlehope section are E. D.\r\nBarns, Nathaniel Barns, Nat. C. Barns, John W. Bingham, W. J. Fowler,\r\nV. J. Kohl and many others. Barnyard manure, muriate of potash and\r\nground bone are the fertilizers used. It is found by these growers\r\nthat the peach can only be grown upon high, dry land with profit.\r\nThe flavor of the fruit produced here is like that of the lower\r\nUlster and northern Orange section, of high quality, and it brings\r\nthe best price.\r\n\r\nRed raspberries and strawberries were very successfully grown in\r\ndifferent parts of the county some years ago, especially about\r\nCornwall and Newburgh, and the northern river section. And both these\r\npopular fruits are still produced to a large extent. Among these\r\nsmall fruit enthusiasts there were the late Rev. E. P. Roe and N. P.\r\nWillis, of Cornwall. North of Newburgh was the home of Andrew J.\r\nDowning and Charles Downing, his brother, whose standard work on\r\n\"The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America\" has been the recognized\r\nauthority upon nomenclature and description of fruits in America,\r\never since it was written.\r\n\r\n             THE ORANGE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nThis society is one of the oldest and best known organizations in the\r\ncounty. It had its beginning at a meeting of citizens called pursuant\r\nto law by Lebbeus L. Vail, county clerk, to organize a county\r\nagricultural society, and held in the Old Stone Court House at\r\nGoshen, September 11, 1841. Of the persons who attended that meeting\r\nthe names of the following have been rescued from oblivion: John\r\nCaldwell, Jesse Bull, Nicholas Dederer, Blooming Grove; William\r\nSayer, Cornwall; Alexander Thompson, Crawford; Aaron Van Duzer,\r\nCharles Monell, John Wilson, Hezekiah H. Strong, Phineas Rumsey,\r\nJames W. Carpenter, Goshen; Hamilton Morrison, Samuel Wait, Jr.,\r\nJohn Wait, Gideon Pelton, John A. Smith, Montgomery; Frederic J.\r\nBetts, Charles Downing, Henry Robinson, Newburgh; Leonard Lee, John\r\nR. Caldwell, New Windsor; William Hurtin, Israel H. Wickham,\r\nWallkill; Jeffrey Wisner, Warwick.\r\n\r\nAt that meeting a constitution and by-laws were adopted, and at the\r\nadjourned meeting, held at the same place, October 13, 1841, the\r\norganization of the society was completed by the election of the\r\nfollowing officers: President, John Caldwell, Blooming Grove;\r\nVice-presidents, Captain Henry Robinson, Newburgh; John R. Caldwell,\r\nNew Windsor; William Sayer, Cornwall; Jeffrey Wisner, Warwick;\r\nLewis H. Roe, Monroe; Hulet Clark, Minisink; James D. Bull,\r\nHamptonburgh; Richard Sears, Goshen; Gideon Pelton, Montgomery; David\r\nC. Bull, Crawford; William Hurtin, Wallkill; William S. Little,\r\nMount Hope; Thomas Van Etten, Deer Park. Recording secretary, John\r\nWilson, Goshen. Corresponding secretary, Joseph W. Gott, Goshen.\r\nTreasurer, Charles Monell, Goshen. Executive committee, Frederic J.\r\nRetts, Samuel Wait, Jr., Leonard Lee, Phineas Rumsey, Alexander\r\nThompson, Charles Dill, Thomas W. Bradner.\r\n\r\nOf the officers then elected not one survives. So long has been the\r\ntime that has passed, and so many and so great the changes that have\r\ntaken place since its organization, that the management of the\r\nsociety is now in the hands of men, few of whom knew any of its\r\nfounders. Although they were prominent men, well-known in their day\r\nand generation, even their names are not familiar to a majority of\r\nits members to-day.\r\n\r\nThe first fair was held at Goshen, November 17, 1841; and although it\r\nwas very late in the season, and there had been but little time for\r\npreparation, it gave such general satisfaction that the success of\r\nthe society was assured. The cattle, sheep and swine were shown on\r\nthe grounds adjacent to the Presbyterian church; the horses were\r\nexhibited on Main street, and the other exhibits in the Old court\r\nhouse. Ninety-seven premiums were awarded amounting to $210, besides\r\ntwenty-one agricultural periodicals.\r\n\r\nThe second fair was held at Goshen, October 12, 1842. The premiums\r\noffered amounted to $333, exclusive of thirty-five agricultural books\r\nand papers, distributed as follows: Farms, $45; cattle, $113; horses,\r\n$38; sheep, $31; swine, $8; butter, $44; agricultural products, $54.\r\nThe county newspapers of that time said \"The exhibition was in the\r\nhighest degree creditable to the agricultural interests of the\r\ncounty. The people assembled in thousands to witness the exhibition,\r\nand thronged the streets in numbers equaled on but few occasions\r\nbefore. The exhibition of domestic manufactures graced the interior\r\nof the new court house.\"\r\n\r\nThe third fair was held October 4, 1843. Five thousand persons were\r\nestimated to have been in attendance. One hundred and thirteen\r\npremiums were awarded amounting to $325, besides twenty-eight\r\npublications. The following extract from the annual report of the\r\npresident, Hon. Frederic J. Retts, is a reminder of changed\r\nconditions: \"About thirty samples of butter were exhibited, and the\r\ncommittee of judges announced that twenty-six of the specimens they\r\nbelieved could not be beat in the world. In superlatives there is no\r\ncomparative degree, and it is difficult to say, therefore, who stands\r\nfirst in such a category. Our wives and our daughters are our\r\ndairy-women, and while they so ably sustain the agricultural\r\nreputation of the county, Old Orange need have no fears for her rank\r\nas a farming county.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1846 the society for the first time held its fair on two days. In\r\nthat year the first plowing match took place and was an interesting\r\nfeature of the exhibition. Each competitor was required to plow\r\none-fourth of an acre in seventy-five minutes, including two rests of\r\nfive minutes each.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting in 1847, mainly through the efforts of the\r\nNewburgh members, the constitution of the society was so amended that\r\nthe annual fair was thereafter to be held at Goshen every alternate\r\nyear and the rest of the time at other places.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 it was held at Newburgh. The mechanical display was made on\r\nthe porch of the court house, the grain and vegetables in the main\r\nhall, the fruit and domestic manufactures in the court room and\r\nwithin the railing, the horses were shown on Liberty street, and the\r\ncattle on a lot west of it. The plowing match took place on the farm\r\nof Captain Robinson. County Judge A. M. Sherman was one of the\r\ncompetitors--he held his own plow, performed his work in the shortest\r\ntime, and received one of the premiums.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the fair was held at Montgomery. The articles were exhibited\r\nunder a tent, the cattle were loose in an adjoining field, the horses\r\nwere shown on Union street; $95 were awarded in premiums on cattle,\r\n$57 on horses, $60 on sheep and swine, $14 on butter and $27 on\r\nplowing.\r\n\r\nAt Middletown in 1852, the fair grounds were located in the eastern\r\npart of the village and were known as the Ogden Track. At the\r\nsuggestion of Colonel Israel H. Wickham (then president), the society\r\nhad purchased a large tent, in which all articles were exhibited.\r\nNearly all the cattle were tied to posts, and the horses for the\r\nfirst time were exhibited on a track.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth fair was held at Chester.\r\n\r\nThe second fair held at Newburgh, October 8 and 9, 1856, was a great\r\nsuccess. The society's tent was erected on grounds attached to\r\nWashington's Headquarters, north of which were posts with ties for\r\ncattle and pens for other animals, the adjacent lot on the south was\r\nused for loose cattle. Arrangements were made with the trustees of\r\nthe village, and with the owners of property on South William,\r\nLiberty and other streets, for the exclusive use of portions of these\r\nstreets for the exhibition of horses. The plowing match and a trial\r\nof plows took place a short distance south of Headquarters. Special\r\nattractions were for the first time provided--there was a parade of\r\nthe entire fire department of the village and a boat race under the\r\nauspices of the Newburgh Regatta Association.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the second fair at Montgomery was said to have been one of\r\nthe best then held in the county. One hundred and ninety-seven\r\npremiums were awarded.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the fair was again held at Middletown. The published accounts\r\nrepresent it to have been still more successful than it had been\r\neight years before.\r\n\r\nDuring these first twenty years of the society's existence it was\r\ncustomary for the executive committee to meet at an early day, fix a\r\ndate for the fair, prepare a premium list, select judges, and have\r\nall published gratuitously in the newspapers of the county. These\r\nearly fairs were generally satisfactory. The grounds not being\r\nenclosed, no admission fee was charged. Articles were exhibited in\r\npublic halls until 1850, and after that in a tent. The expenses were\r\nlight, the premiums few and payment was obtained from membership fees\r\nand the State appropriation, supplemented by private contributions\r\nprocured by personal importunity.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting in 1861 the executive committee was empowered\r\nto raise by stock subscription a sum of money sufficient to purchase\r\nor lease suitable grounds, and to erect buildings and fences\r\nthereon--the grounds to be in the vicinity of Goshen. The committee\r\nleased the grounds known as the Goshen Driving Park and issued\r\ncertificates of stock, in shares of $25 each, bearing interest at the\r\nrate of ten per cent, per annum. The number of shares was fixed at\r\n100, and no person was permitted to subscribe for more than one\r\nshare. All the stock was promptly taken, and the building\r\n(Agricultural Hall) occupied by the society from 1862 to 1874. During\r\nthis period the interests of the turf were predominant and not\r\nentirely regarded as creditable exhibitions of the products of the\r\nfarm, the workshop, or the home.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the society was reorganized and incorporated. Having failed\r\nto secure a renewal of the lease for the grounds, it was determined\r\nthat the fair building should be sold at auction, and on the 20th of\r\nDecember it was sold for $300. The proceeds of the sale were in part\r\napplied to the payment of debts, the balance was divided pro rata\r\namong the stockholders, who, as an element of the society, then\r\nceased to exist.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the society was therefore composed only of members. It was\r\nwithout grounds. It was out of funds and out of debt--having neither\r\nassets nor liabilities. Its exhibitions held many years at Goshen,\r\nthe residents of that village had tired of them, and the people in\r\nother sections of the county took but little interest in them.\r\nSeveral of its leading managers were so absorbed in horse trotting\r\nthat other departments had been neglected. The number of entries had\r\nbeen reduced to less than 400. The attendance of visitors was\r\ncomparatively small, and the membership had dwindled to about\r\nseventy.\r\n\r\nUnder these discouraging circumstances, such of the officers as\r\ncontinued to take an interest in the society accepted the invitation\r\nof citizens of Montgomery to hold the thirty-fourth fair in that\r\nvillage. The result fully vindicated the wisdom of their action. More\r\nthan 1,000 entries were made. Many new members were enrolled,\r\nprominent among whom was the Rev. L. L. Comfort, whose influence and\r\nexample did much to elevate it from the condition into which it had\r\nfallen. The fairs continued to be held at Montgomery for four years,\r\nduring which time the treasury was replenished and a surplus fund\r\nformed which in 1887 amounted to about $8,000.\r\n\r\nThe memorable fair in 1878, held at Washingtonville, was the\r\nbeginning of a new era. For the first time in twenty years no\r\ntrotting or racing was seen on the grounds. It was in all respects a\r\nlegitimate and successful exhibition, and was only excelled by that\r\nof the following year, held at the same place, when nearly 2,600\r\nentries were made, and 800 premiums, amounting to more than $1,500,\r\nawarded. During these two years the Orange County fair was raised to\r\nthe high plane that it has since occupied.\r\n\r\nAt Warwick in 1880 and 1881 the excellence of its exhibitions were\r\nfully maintained. The additions then made to the society's membership\r\nrolls, and to its council board, were of great value, and were\r\nlargely instrumental in securing the successes of subsequent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the fair was located at Middletown, where it remained three\r\nyears, exceeding in magnitude of display all former ones. The record\r\nof over 1,100 membership fees received, and of 379 entries of horses\r\nthe third year, have not since been broken.\r\n\r\nThe status of the society not being in harmony with the articles of\r\nassociation, at the annual meeting in 1884, new articles of\r\nassociation were adopted and signed, and a new certificate of\r\nincorporation and reorganization filed with the secretary of state\r\nand with the county clerk.\r\n\r\nThe next three fairs held at Newburgh witnessed such exhibitions of\r\nthe results of industry and skill as had never before been seen in\r\nthis county. The visit of Governor Hill in 1887, was the first time\r\nthe society bad been honored with the presence of the chief\r\nexecutive of the State on its fair grounds.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 and 1889 the fairs were held at Goshen. The number of entries\r\nwas fully up to the average of recent fairs, while the quality of the\r\nexhibits in several departments had never been better. At the first\r\nof these fairs the society was honored with an address by the Hon.\r\nNorman J. Coleman, United States Commissioner of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe semi-centennial fair at Port Jervis in 1890, and that of 1891,\r\nwere in all respects, very successful. In the latter year the whole\r\nnumber of entries was 5,120, nearly 700 more than at any former fair.\r\nIn the domestic department nearly 1,200 entries were made, evincing\r\nin many ways woman's inventive genius and patient industry. The\r\nexhibition of articles of historic interest has never been equaled in\r\nthis county.\r\n\r\nThe society's second visit to Warwick was in 1892 and 1893. The\r\npresence of Governor Flower, with the 5th and 10th Separate Companies\r\nof Newburgh as his military escort, was a noteworthy event.\r\n\r\nThe fairs of 1894, 1895 and 1896, held at Newburgh, are said to have\r\nbeen the greatest the Society has ever held. The number of entries in\r\ncertain classes will give some idea of its magnitude. Cattle, 272\r\nentries; horses, 116; poultry, 1,502; bench shows, 208; mechanical,\r\n238; grain and vegetables, 849; fruit, 1,144; flowers, 204; culinary,\r\n310; domestic 990; miscellaneous, 223. Total in all classes, 6,084.\r\nThe exhibition of school work not entered for competition was a\r\nrevelation to thousands of visitors of the work now being done by the\r\npupils of public, private and parochial schools.\r\n\r\nAfter the fair of 1896, the managers of the society being unable to\r\nobtain a satisfactory lease of the grounds for a term of years,\r\npurchased the Campbell Track Grounds at Middletown, April 16, 1897.\r\nThese grounds are well adapted to fair purposes, and when\r\ncontemplated improvements are made they will compare favorably, in\r\nconvenience and beauty, with any fair grounds in the State.\r\n\r\nThe last eleven fairs have been held on these grounds. They are\r\nevents of such recent occurrence that historic interest does not yet\r\nattach to them. It may, however, be well to say that these eleven\r\nexhibitions have been in magnitude and excellence highly creditable\r\nto the society.\r\n\r\nThe society occupies a prominent place in the front rank of the\r\nagricultural societies of the State. Organized to promote\r\nagriculture, horticulture, the mechanic and household arts, it has\r\nnot lost sight of these objects. During the sixty-eight years of its\r\nexistence, in times of prosperity and seasons of adversity, in peace\r\nand in war, it has never failed to hold its annual fair. It is a\r\nsociety whose reputation is unblemished, whose honor is bright, whose\r\nrecord is clean; a society that has not sacrificed right for\r\nexpediency nor won temporary success at the expense of principle; a\r\nsociety that has never repudiated its debts but has honorably\r\ndischarged all its obligations; a society that has always paid its\r\npremiums in full and never paid them pro rata; a society whose fair\r\ngrounds have not been noisy with the voices of fakirs, defiled with\r\nthe devices of gamblers nor desecrated by immoral shows, but have\r\nbeen consecrated to legitimate exhibitions; a society whose\r\nmanagement during the years that are gone has been such that no rival\r\nsociety (town or district) has ever been organized within the limits\r\nof the county, to sap the sources of its prosperity, limit the sphere\r\nof its operations, or lessen the extent of its influence--a fact\r\nwithout a parallel in the State.\r\n\r\n   Presidents, Secretaries and Treasurers of The Orange County\r\n          Agricultural Society from 1841 to 1908.\r\n\r\n     _Presidents._\r\n\r\n John Caldwell, Blooming Grove 1841\r\n Frederic J.

Reed suggested to the writer the\r\nadvisability of the farmers of the Wallkill valley uniting in an\r\neffort to secure the appointment of a Farmers' Institute, to be held\r\nunder the auspices of the New York State Department of Farmers'\r\nInstitutes. An hour later, in consultation with Nicholas J. Fowler,\r\nit was decided to invite representative agriculturists to meet at his\r\noffice on the evening of November 11, at which time a local society\r\nwould be formed. The result of this meeting was highly satisfactory.\r\nWilliam C. Weller was appointed chairman, William C. Hart, secretary,\r\nand Nicholas J. Fowler, treasurer, with committees on finance, music,\r\naddresses, etc. On November 25, at an adjourned meeting, the\r\nexecutive committee reported an enrollment of one hundred and\r\nsixty-eight members, with liberal responses in contributions to\r\ndefray expenses.\r\n\r\nThe Institute held at Scofield Hall, December 19, 20 and 21, proved\r\nsuccessful beyond the anticipation of its promoters and immediately\r\nsuggested the desirability of forming a permanent organization. The\r\nidea was greatly strengthened on February 10 at Coldenham, N. Y.,\r\nwhen Mr. George T. Powell, of Ghent, N. Y., gave a stirring address\r\non the importance of carrying forward the movement, which appealed\r\nstrongly to all. Thus started the movement which has resulted in the\r\npresent organization--an association that has done more to unfold the\r\nbeauty and charm of the Wallkill Valley and spread its fair name to\r\nremote localities than all efforts put forth by similar attempts in\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\n                      OBJECTS OF ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\nThe realization of the inestimable majesty; the unspeakable goodness\r\nof God as revealed in this marvelous valley, thus indirectly leading\r\nthe thought of humanity into the valleys and rivers of life eternal.\r\n\r\nThe attainment of knowledge which comes of well ordered discussion.\r\nIncreased skill in the methods of labor.\r\n\r\nThe mutual improvement of its members by disseminating reliable and\r\nvaluable information tending to promote the best interests of the\r\nWallkill valley.\r\n\r\nSuch advantages as may be derived through associated effort to\r\npromote a higher degree of excellence in farm, garden and\r\nagricultural affairs generally. The introduction and testing of\r\nflowers, shrubs, forest and ornamental trees.\r\n\r\nIt is the primary object of the Society to awaken interest in and\r\npromote the progress of that noblest of all human callings,\r\nagriculture, and it is the policy of the board of managers to\r\ninterest all in its annual outing--not only as an exhibition of the\r\nprosperity and progress of the farming section, of the growths of\r\nfield and orchard and garden, of intelligent competition in\r\nstock-breeding and dairy interests, but as a demonstration of the\r\npublic spirit, intelligence and prosperity of the entire productive\r\nand business community.\r\n\r\n                THE OUTING DAYS AND OLD HOME WEEK.\r\n\r\nAs the society grew and prospered it was decided to establish a\r\nsocial side to the many interests represented. Arrangements were made\r\nwith much enthusiasm on the part of its membership to hold beneath\r\nthe open sky an outing that would have a tendency to attract the\r\nfarming community with their guests and friends that might prove\r\nadvantageous to all.\r\n\r\nMEMORIAL DAYS--DATES AND LOCATIONS OF THE OUTINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n 1893--August 25, at Woodlawn Farm\r\n 1894--August 15, at Borden's Home Farm.\r\n 1895--August 21, at Woodlawn Farm.\r\n 1896--August 13, at Woodlawn Farm.\r\n 1897--August 26, at Woodlawn Farm, Walden.\r\n 1898--August 10, at Scofield's Grove, Walden.\r\n 1899--August 9, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving Park.\r\n 1900--August 8, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving Park.\r\n 1901--August 14, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving Park.\r\n 1902--August 13, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving Park.\r\n 1903--August 12 and 13, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving\r\n   Park.\r\n 1904--August 17 and 18, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving\r\n   Park.\r\n 1905--August 16 and 17, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving\r\n   Park.\r\n 1906--August 15, 16 and 17, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving\r\n   Park.\r\n 1907--August 14 and 15, at Gillespie's Grove and Walden Driving\r\n   Park.\r\n\r\nHighly artistic booklets have been issued since 1894, under the\r\nsupervision of William C.

There are twenty-two subordinate\r\nGranges with a total membership of 2,470 in the county, as reported\r\nby delegate John Y. Gerow at the last annual session of the State\r\nGrange, and all are in a most prosperous condition. A Pomona Grange,\r\nwhich is the link between the subordinate granges and the State\r\norganization, was formed at Washingtonville, April 18, 1903, with 118\r\nmembers. This has now about 600 members. Mr. Gerow was the chairman\r\nfor three years and was presented with a gold badge at his\r\nresignation. Albert Manning is now the master. Five of the\r\nsubordinate granges in the county own their halls, three own\r\nbuildings and conduct cooperative stores successfully.\r\n\r\nThe first Grange organized in the county was at Unionville, June 27,\r\n1901, with thirty-four charter members. It is known as the Minisink\r\nNo. 907. W. A. Lain was the first master. The membership has\r\nincreased to 168. Alva Case is the present master. The Monroe Grange\r\nwas the second in order of date, beginning December 12, 1901. It is\r\nNo. 911; there were only eighteen charter members, which was\r\nincreased lo 147. George S. Bull was the first master and James\r\nSeaman is now at the head. Grange No. 912 started at Washingtonville,\r\nwith John W. Gerow as master. This Grange now operates a general\r\nstore. Little Britain, Grange No. 913 was next started with twenty\r\nmembers, Charles E. Knapp being the first master. This has now 115\r\nmembers and William D. Moores is the present master. The Brookside\r\nGrange No. 936, began November 18, 1902, with a membership of\r\ntwenty-two, which has been increased to 173. Clarence O. Warford is\r\nthe present master. The Mountainville Grange, No. 946, was started\r\nDecember 12, 1902, with twenty-two members. C. E. Hand is now the\r\nmaster. The Warwick Grange, No. 948, was organized January 6, 1903\r\nwith twenty-nine members, which has since been increased to\r\nninety-six. C. M. Houston is the master, and a general feed, coal and\r\nfarmers' supply store is operated. The Hamptonburgh Grange, No. 950,\r\nbegan January 7, 1903, with thirty-nine members, which has been\r\nincreased to 115, with S. P. Watkins as master. The Stony Ford\r\nGrange, No. 951, was organized with twenty-one members, January 8,\r\n1903, Ebenezer Bull having been the master from the first, the\r\npresent membership being forty-five. The Goshen Grange, No. 975,\r\nbegan March 25, 1903, with nineteen members, which has been increased\r\nto 137. William Hughes is the master, and a general store is operated\r\nwith an extensive trade. The Cronomer Valley Grange, No. 982, built\r\na large meeting hall in 1907; Nat C. Barnes is the master. This\r\nGrange was organized, June 20, 1903, with twenty charter members.\r\nMr. Dewitt C. Osborn was the first master. There are now 151 members.\r\nGrange No. 916 was organized at Montgomery, February 11, 1902, with\r\nthirteen charter members. George Van Alst was the first master. The\r\npresent membership is 148, and Harry Tweddle is master. The following\r\nadditional Granges in the county were organized in the order\r\nindicated by the number of each:\r\n\r\n     Present Master\r\n  983 G. L. Sayer,       Middletown.\r\n  984 A. C.

T. Doty]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nJOURNALISM IN ORANGE COUNTY\r\n\r\nBy W. T. Doty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FIRST APPEARANCE.\r\n\r\nFrom the accessible records it seems that the \"art preservative\"\r\nentered Orange County by way of Goshen in 1788. It appeared next in\r\nNewburgh in 1895, {_sic_} at New Windsor in 1799, at Montgomery in\r\n1806, New Vernon in 1833, Slate Hill in 1834, Middletown, in 1840,\r\nPort Jervis in 1850, Warwick in 1845, Pine Bush in 1868, Walden in\r\n1869, Cornwall 1871, Monroe 1882, Cornwall-on-Hudson in 1888, Chester\r\n1888, Highland Falls 1891, Washingtonville 1899.\r\n\r\nAt first thought it appears more probable that Newburgh was the first\r\nport of entry, from the fact that the latter early felt the contact\r\nof the civilization advancing up the Hudson--practically the only\r\nhighway into the great unknown interior prior to, during and\r\nimmediately following the American Revolution; and also as, during\r\nthe Revolution, Samuel Louden followed the retreating footsteps of\r\nthe American forces from New York City to Fishkill, printing or\r\nissuing, at convenient times, the _New York Packet._ This was issued,\r\nit appears, at Fishkill. Why not in Newburgh, where so many great\r\nevents in connection with the Revolutionary period occurred?\r\n\r\nHowever, Goshen seems to have been a hamlet or village as early as\r\n1714, while Newburgh's first settlement was about 1719, and the\r\nrecords accord to the old county seat the honor of housing the first\r\nprinting office in Orange County.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 David Mandeville and David M. Wescott issued the _Goshen\r\nRepository._ That they were men of some literary ability is surmised\r\nfrom the fact that they were connected with the Goshen Academy--that\r\nancient and honorable seat of learning--an institution of which,\r\nalso, Goshen should feel a thrill of pride.\r\n\r\nThe office of the _Repository_ was, in 1793, near the court house.\r\nThe _Repository_ was sold to John G. and William Heurtin, in 1800,\r\nat which time its name was changed to the _Orange County Patriot._\r\nIn 1801 Gabriel Denton secured the interest of William Heurtin, and\r\nin 1803 Denton sold his interest to William A. Carpenter, and the\r\nname of the paper was changed to that of _The Friend of Truth._ The\r\nyear following it again changed owners and names, when Ward M. Gazlay\r\nbecame its publisher and it became the _Orange Eagle._ The next year\r\n(1805) the office was burned and Mr. Gazlay removed the remains to\r\nNewburgh, where the paper, in union with _The Recorder of the Times,_\r\nwhich Mr. Gazlay purchased, became the _Political Index,_ and this\r\nlived until 1829.\r\n\r\nAccording to the record the second journalistic venture in the county\r\nwas in 1795, when the _Newburgh Packet_ appeared, printed at Newburgh\r\nby Lucius Carey, and in 1797 it became _The Mirror_ under David\r\nDenniston. Denniston had purchased the paper of Carey (1797), in\r\nwhich year it was announced that the paper was printed by Philip Van\r\nHome. In 1798 Joseph W. Barber was the printer, and he advertised,\r\n\"also, Printing and Book Binding carried on by David Denniston.\" _The\r\nMirror_ was absorbed (1804) by the _Rights of Man,_ and the latter by\r\n_The Recorder of the Times_ in 1805.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 we hear of the _New Windsor Gazette,_ through the removal of\r\na paper of that name from New Windsor to Newburgh, by Jacob Schultz.\r\nHow long it had existed at New Windsor is now purely conjectural, but\r\nas most of the newspapers of that early period were sort of birds of\r\npassage, it is assumed that the year 1799 witnessed the _Gazette's_\r\nhatching at New Windsor and its fledgling flight to Newburgh, where\r\nit became the _Orange County Gazette._ It became _The Citizen_ when\r\nlater purchased by David Denniston.\r\n\r\nThe year 1799 also brought forth at Newburgh another publication,\r\n_The Rights of Man,_ with Dr. Elias Winfield as its sponsor, for whom\r\nit was \"printed by Benoni H. Howell.\" David Denniston purchased this\r\npaper and merged in it the _Orange County Gazette._ We learn that the\r\n_Mirror_ of 1797 was absorbed by _The Rights of Man_ in 1804, and\r\nthen the _Packet,_ the _Mirror,_ and the _Gazette_ disappear. The\r\n_Mirror_ and the _Citizen_ espoused the patriotic political works and\r\nprobably the religious doctrines of Thomas Paine, who wrote \"The\r\nCrisis,\" \"Common Sense,\" and \"The Rights of Man,\" while the _Gazette_\r\nadvocated opposite theories. The paper, _The Rights of Man,_ which\r\nabsorbed the _Mirror_ and the _Citizen,_ represented the Jeffersonian\r\nbranch of the Republican party, while the _Recorder of the Times,_\r\nclaiming to be Republican in politics, represented the Federalists\r\nand Burr, then a Federalist.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 appeared at Newburgh the _Recorder of the Times,_ by Dennis\r\nColes. Then at Goshen the same year, _The Friend of Truth,_ under the\r\nmanagement of Ward M. Gazlay, and in 1804 at Goshen the _Orange\r\nCounty Gazette,_ conducted by Gabriel Denton. It will be seen there\r\nwere, within five years, two _Orange County Gazettes_ in the\r\ncounty--one at Newburgh, one at Goshen. As the former metamorphosed\r\nitself into the _Public Index,_ the _Orange Telegraph,_ the\r\n_Newhurgh Telegraph_ and the _Newburgh Register,_ with short pauses\r\nbetween, it may be that it had thrown off the first epidermis and was\r\nemerging in new form when its Goshen namesake burst into the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nMontgomery was looming up from its settlement in 1721, or soon\r\nthereafter, and in 1810 it was large enough, or felt important\r\nenough, to become incorporated as a village. But as early as 1806 the\r\nprinter or publisher saw an \"aching void\" in the growing hamlet, to\r\npervade which the _Orange County Republican_ was called into\r\nexistence that year. It was \"published for the Proprietors by Cyrus\r\nBeach and Luther Pratt.\" Who the \"Proprietors\" were is not in\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of record right here that this Montgomery journalistic\r\nventure is the only one, up to that date, that lives to-day. Through\r\nmigration and other changes this _Orange County Republican_\r\nultimately became the _Independent Republican,_ with a permanent\r\nabiding place in Goshen.\r\n\r\nThat venerable editor and historian, Edward M. Ruttenber, says the\r\n_Orange County Republican_ was first published \"at Ward's Bridge,\"\r\nthe title of the first post-office in Montgomery, so called from the\r\nfact that it was located and kept at James Ward's gristmill, where\r\nhe had thrown a bridge across the Wallkill, constituting it one of\r\nthe most convenient locations for the delivery of mail matter.\r\n\r\nThe money to start the paper was advanced in equal shares by\r\ntwenty-four \"Patriotic citizens of this county, consisting chiefly of\r\nrespectable farmers and mostly inhabitants of the town of\r\nMontgomery.\" This excerpt is from a statement in the paper itself of\r\nthe issue of June 9, 1806. The paper \"admitted there was some honesty\r\namong Federalists,\" but was bitterly opposed to Dewitt Clinton.\r\nJanuary 18, 1812, Luther Pratt, the publisher then, changed its name\r\nto the _Independent Republican_ as more clearly indicating its\r\npolitical policy and views. It was not until 1822 that it was removed\r\nto Goshen, four years after James A. Cheevey became its proprietor.\r\nHe was a Frenchman and a practical printer.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 appeared another publication, the _Political Index,_ at\r\nNewburgh, by Ward M. Gazlay. The latter's _Orange Eagle_ plant at\r\nGoshen was burned in 1805, and he had removed the remnants to\r\nNewburgh, the Phoenix emerging from these ashes being the _Political\r\nIndex._ The _Index_ is credited with having, some years later,\r\n\"apparently consolidated the interests of the Republican party.\" It\r\ngave a \"hearty support to the administration of Jefferson and\r\nMadison, and to the war of 1812.\" It is further stated that \"its\r\npolitical articles were mainly from the pen of Jonathan Fisk, one of\r\nthe most able men of the period.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the _Index_ passed into the ownership of Charles M. Cushman,\r\nwho changed its name to the _Orange Telegraph,_ and later to the\r\n_Newburgh Telegraph._ In 1839 Mr. Cushman sold it to Henry H. Van\r\nDyck, who, in 1840, sold it to Elias Pitts, who, in 1850, disposed of\r\nit to Edward M. Ruttenber. The latter sold it in 1857 to Joseph\r\nLawson, repurchased it in 1859, resold it in 1861 to E. W. Gray, who\r\nsold it, in 1864, to George M. Warren, he to Isaac V. Montanye in the\r\nsame year; he to E. M. Ruttenber in 1865; he to A. A. Bensel in 1867;\r\nhe to J. J. McNally in 1869, who, in 1874, sold it to Dr. Cooper, of\r\nWarwick. In 1876 E. M. Ruttenber again became its owner, and changed\r\nits name to the _Newburgh Register._ February 24, 1908, the\r\npublication of the _Register_ was suspended.\r\n\r\nHere, then, appears the second paper to come down to us from that\r\nearly period, though only after many ups and down and with\r\nkaleidoscopic changes of titles and owners. Mr. Ruttenber assures us\r\nthat \"_The Telegraph,_ although Democratic at all times, opposed the\r\nAlbany Regency--a fact which led to its purchase by H. H. Van Dyck,\r\nor rather the purchase for him. Mr. Pitts, who had been sent to take\r\nMr. Van Dyck's place, very soon fell into the line of thought of his\r\nlocal supporters, and not only approved the Regency, but upheld the\r\n'Free Soil' banner of 1848 with marked ability. In the subsequent\r\nchanges and revolutions,\" adds Mr. Ruttenber, \"in politics it has\r\nmaintained the Democratic faith.\"\r\n\r\nAn ambitious effort appeared at Goshen in 1808 when Gabriel Denton\r\nlaunched the _Orange County Patriot and Spirit of Seventy-six._ In\r\nthis publication we recognize the third journalistic venture with\r\nsufficient tenacity of life to come down to our own day, though it,\r\ntoo, had to change its title and character somewhat ere it became the\r\npresent well-known _Goshen Democrat._\r\n\r\nFrom 1808 to 1820 there seems to be a hiatus. There does not appear\r\na single new journalistic venture in that time, although it was in\r\nthis period, in 1812-13, that the _Orange County Republican_ became\r\nthe _Independent Republican,_ and in 1822 was removed from Montgomery\r\nto Goshen. The war of 1812, impending, progressing and ending, with\r\nwar's all-demoralizing effects, may account for this cooling of the\r\njournalistic ardor for twelve long years.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the next new publication to appear in the\r\nfield--figuratively if not literally--was the _Orange Farmer,_ in\r\n1820, at Goshen. Its founders, Williams and Farrand, were graduates,\r\nMr. Ruttenber says, of the _Albany Plow-Boy_ publication. How long\r\nthe _Orange Farmer_ ploughed through the journalistic heather of\r\nOrange County is not now known, but we never hear of it again. Mr.\r\nRuttenber records that \"Samuel Williams, the associate of Mr.\r\nFarrand, died at Rondout, June 16, 1878, in his ninetieth year--the\r\noldest printer in the State, and for forty years a member of the\r\nBaptist denomination.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1822, John D. Spaulding began, at Newburgh, the publication\r\nof the _Newburgh Gazette._ This passed through many owners' hands,\r\nappearing in 1856, under the management of Eugene W. Gray as the\r\n_Daily News._ Later it passed a somewhat checkered career in\r\nalliances with the _Gazette,_ the _Telegraph,_ the _Daily Telegraph_\r\n(1864), _Daily Union,_ same year, the _Press_ (1866), and the\r\n_Register_ in 1876.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. R. Wilson began at Newburgh, in 1824, the publication of\r\na religious monthly of forty-eight pages, under the title of the\r\n_Evangelical Witness._ It was devoted to the exposition of the\r\ndoctrines of the Reformed Presbyterian church, and was continued four\r\nyears, to be succeeded (1828) by the _Christian Statesman,_ which\r\ngave up the ghost after one year's struggle in this cruel, cold\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAn anti-Jackson paper appeared in Newburgh during the campaign of\r\n1828. It was called _The Beacon._ Its editor was Judge William B.\r\nWright.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the _Orange Telegraph_ appeared at Newburgh. It was merely\r\nour old friend, the _Political Index,_ in a new guise, under the\r\ntutelage of Charles M. Cushman, who subsequently named it the\r\n_Newburgh Telegraph._\r\n\r\nA monthly quarterly appeared next in Newburgh in May, 1832, as\r\n_Tablets of Rural Economy._ John W. Knevels was the editor. The\r\npeople then, as too often now, had no use for rural or other economy,\r\nand the quarterly died after a few issues.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 appeared another publication--one that time has dealt with\r\nso kindly that we find it to-day brandishing, as of old, \"The sword\r\nof the Lord and of Gideon.\" The _Signs of the Times_ was started at\r\nGoshen in this year by Lebbeus L. Vail as an exponent or expounder of\r\nthe Old School Baptist theology. The first numbers were printed at\r\nthe office of the _Independent Republican._ Mr. Vail, though born a\r\nCongregationalist--his father, Isaiah Vail, being one of the founders\r\nof the present First Congregationalist church of Middletown--became\r\nan enthusiastic Old School Baptist through the influence of his wife,\r\nSally, daughter of Wilmot Moore, and her father's family. Like most\r\nneophytes, Mr. Vail became very earnest, and gave freely of his\r\npurse, his time, and his energies, and the _Signs of the Times_ soon\r\nbecame a recognized factor in Old School Baptist work. This\r\npublication was only one of the forms of his contributions to the\r\ncause, with no hope of material reward. Two years later Mr. Vail\r\nbecame county clerk. Recognizing in a young enthusiast in the Old\r\nSchool Baptist faith an Elijah in the cause and fit to wear the\r\nmantle, he was forced by civic duties to lay aside, he turned over to\r\nElder Gilbert Beebe the entire plant and good will of the _Signs of\r\nthe Times._ Mr. Beebe removed the office to New Vernon, then a\r\nsomewhat thriving hamlet with a well-appointed Old School Baptist\r\nchurch, with store, post-office, hotel, blacksmith shop, and the\r\naccessories of a live community. The place is on the Shawangunk Kill,\r\non the Orange and Sullivan County line, about four miles northwest of\r\nMiddletown. Mr. Beebe removed the plant again, this time to\r\nAlexandria, Va., whence he returned with it to New Vernon, and in\r\n1847 or 1848 removed it to Middletown, where it still oscillates, as\r\nof old, the sword of Gideon. Elder Beebe preached to congregations in\r\nMiddletown, Brookfield (Slate Hill), Bloomingburg, Van Burenville or\r\nWallkill, and New Vernon. He was an energetic, tireless worker, and\r\nbuilt up an immense circulation for the _Signs of the Times._ It\r\nbecame a power in Old School Baptist faith throughout the United\r\nStates, and was for years--and is yet--the leading publication in\r\nthis faith. In the sixties Elder Beebe reprinted sermons and Old\r\nSchool Baptist verses in book form, taken from files of the _Signs._\r\nTwo volumes were printed and they had great sale. The _Signs of the\r\nTimes,_ first published as a monthly, became a semi-monthly, which it\r\nis now, with thirty pages and covers. It is one of the remarkable and\r\nquaint publications in this country to-day. Its contents are a study\r\nfor the historian, whether of religious or secular subjects. Whatever\r\nits other merits, its very quaintness should preserve it from the\r\nvandalism of time, the sacrilege of events, and the blasphemy of\r\nenvironment. It stands as a monument to the enterprise, the religious\r\nfeelings, enthusiasm, aims and forces of a period and a propagandism\r\nthat seem slowly but surely fading into the twilight of the ages. It\r\nis now \"Published the first and fifteenth of each month by J. E.\r\nBeebe & Co., Middletown, N. Y.,\" with Elder F. A. Chick, Hopewell,\r\nN. J., and Elder H. C. Ker, Middletown, as editors.\r\n\r\nThe _Newburgh Daily Journal_ was started in 1833 or 1834 by John D.\r\nSpalding, which he continued until 1843, when he changed the name to\r\nthe _Highland Courier._ After his death, August 22, 1853, Mrs.\r\nSpalding, his widow, published it until 1855, when she sold it to\r\nWilliam E. Smiley. Edward Nixon became its proprietor in 1858, and\r\nRufus A. Reed in 1859, who changed its name to the _Highland\r\nChieftain._\r\n\r\nThe name was afterwards changed to the _Newburgh Daily Journal,_\r\nwhich it retains to the present day. On June 1, 1861, Cyrus B. Martin\r\nbecame the owner and its whole character at once radically changed\r\nfor the better. Mr. Martin was peculiarly fitted for editorial duties\r\nand under his able management the paper soon attained a large\r\ncirculation and eventually gained that high standing and wide sphere\r\nof influence, which under the wise control of his successors it has\r\never since retained.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin remained the owner of the _Journal_ until 1877, when he\r\nsold out to the Messrs. Samuel Ritchie, Lawrence C. Bodine and Frank\r\nS. Hull. Before the year was up, Mr. Bodine disposed of his interests\r\nto his partners, and those two gentlemen have managed the paper ever\r\nsince, although their interests are merged in the corporation known\r\nas the Newburgh Journal Company.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal_ is housed in a building owned by itself, a handsome,\r\nspacious structure, located on the corner of Smith and Third streets,\r\nwhere it maintains one of the most complete printing establishments\r\nand book bindery plants to be found in the county.\r\n\r\nThe _Republican Banner_ existed in Montgomery in 1833 or 1834. or in\r\nboth those years, with Calvin F. S. Thomas as its publisher, but that\r\nis all that seems to be known about it.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 a handsomely printed weekly appeared in the thriving locality\r\nof Brookfield or Slate Hill, known as the _Republican Sentinel,_ or\r\n\"the _Farmers' Protests Against Political Speculation and\r\nDictation.\"_\r\n\r\nThe writer has a few copies of the _Sentinel,_ which show it to have\r\nbeen a highly creditable publication, in its make-up, its\r\ntypographical appearance, and in its literary features. The issue for\r\nApril 12, 1834, was No. 6, of Vol. I, and it was \"Printed by Tho's\r\nP. Evans for the Publisher.\" May 17 the issue was No. 10, and\r\nannounced that \"The _Republican Sentinel_ is printed every Saturday\r\nby D. Yokum for the Proprietor.\" The issue for June 28 was No. 16,\r\nand contained the same announcement as to the printer, but in no\r\nissue does it appear who the editor or publisher was. The _Sentinel_\r\nwas a five-column folio, improving typographically with each issue,\r\nand printed from clean-faced brevier or possibly minion type. When it\r\nceased to exist no one now living seems to know.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, in Newburgh, Wallace T. Sweet issued the _National\r\nAdvertiser,_ which was merged into the _Newburgh Telegraph,_ though\r\nin what year is not stated.\r\n\r\nThe _Reformed Presbyterian_ appeared in Newburgh March 1, 1836, with\r\nRev. Moses Roney as editor. It was a monthly of thirty-two pages. In\r\n1849 he removed it to Pittsburgh, Pa.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 A. A. Bensel began the publication of Middletown's first\r\nrecorded newspaper venture. He called it the _Middletown Courier._\r\nIt was a weekly paper, democratic in politics. In April, 1846, he\r\nremoved the entire plant to Kingston, N. Y., where he started the\r\n_Ulster Democrat._\r\n\r\nIn 1845, in Newburgh, the Rev. David L. Proudfit began issuing the\r\n_Christian Instructor,_ a monthly of thirty-two pages. Two years\r\nlater he sold it to the Rev. J. B. Dales, who removed it to\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nSo far as records can be found the first publication to appear in\r\nWarwick was an Old School Baptist journal, the _Doctrinal Advocate\r\nand Monitor._ This was in 1845 or 1846, possibly earlier. It was\r\npublished and probably edited by Elder Jewett. In 1846 it was merged\r\nwith Elder Gilbert Beebe's _Signs of the Times._\r\n\r\nMiddletown was without a paper from April to July, in 1846. At the\r\nlatter date John S. Brown began there the publication of the\r\n_Orange County News._ It was neutral in politics, and Mr. Ruttenber\r\nsays it was hardly deserving the name of a newspaper. It died in\r\n1849, the material being purchased by Gilbert J. Beebe for his new\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frederick W. Wilson]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1848, Gilbert J. Beebe started in Middletown the\r\npublication of the _Banner of Liberty._ It was issued monthly as a\r\nconservative journal--opposing all the modern ideas of reform in\r\npolitics, in religion, in laws and in temperance. In 1856 it became\r\na weekly, and espoused the cause of the democratic party. In 1856\r\nMr. Beebe issued the _Campaign Banner_--a sort of auxiliary to the\r\n_Banner of Liberty._ Both were more or less pro-slavery in all their\r\nutterances; the particular limb of the democracy to which they clung\r\nbeing known as \"Hunkerism\" prior to the Civil War, as \"Copperheadish\"\r\nduring and after the Civil War. In ante-bellum days both papers\r\nattained a big circulation for those times--\"fully 27,000 copies,\"\r\nMr. Ruttenber says. _The Banner of Liberty_ was taken everywhere in\r\nthe South and Southwest, and below Mason and Dixon's line it was\r\nall-powerful. And even north of that line there were many who swore\r\nby the Great Horn Spoon and the _Banner of Liberty._ The income was\r\ngreat, and had Mr. Beebe been as astute a business man as he was\r\naggressive in polemics, he would have been numbered with the\r\nexclusive few of that day known as millionaires. But Gilbert Judson\r\nBeebe was a different type of man. Like his venerable father, he had\r\na principle--right or wrong, but right as he saw it--and pelf was\r\npowerless against his adamantine purposes.\r\n\r\nHis father, Elder Gilbert Beebe, was in position to \"roll in wealth.\"\r\nHe had a great income from his _Signs of the Times,_ and from his\r\nwritings and books; he had the machinery of his church to manipulate\r\nfor his own aggrandizement, if he so willed; he was almost an idol\r\nwherever the Old School Baptists had an abiding place in this\r\ncountry; but he disdained all sordid allurements, and, armed with his\r\nown peculiar interpretation of the Scriptures, he lived frugally and\r\npounded his theorems and theological dogmas for three and four\r\nstraight hours every Sunday in one of his pulpits, and during the\r\nfortnight in the columns of his _Signs._\r\n\r\nThe writer of this knew him well; set type a long time in his office\r\nin Orchard street, Middletown; fed his presses; helped get out one of\r\nhis book of songs and sermons, and always held the venerable\r\neditor-preacher in respect if not in absolute awe. Looking back at\r\nthose days from the year 1908, the writer understands better the\r\nmagnetism which gave Elder Beebe his great power among the people.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar personality was not lost in his children. In Gilbert\r\nJudson Beebe--who made the _Banner of Liberty_ the most powerful\r\npro-slavery journal for years in ante-bellum days--individuality,\r\naggressiveness, polemics, even the most violent dogmatism, were\r\nconstantly in evidence. Not only did he wield a most trenchant,\r\nbitter pen, ever dipped in the wormwood of invective and the gall of\r\nexpletives--he was an orator as well; and could work his hearers up\r\nto a pitch of frenzy or tears. The writer, yet in his teens, was\r\nemployed on the _Banner of Liberty_ as a \"compositor\" for a\r\nconsiderable time, and had much opportunity for learning the\r\ncharacteristics of the man.\r\n\r\nThe _Banner of Liberty_ lost much of its power when the Civil War\r\nboomed its terrors over the land. Its circulation fell off daily, but\r\nthe editor every week just as religiously sailed into the \"Lincoln\r\nhirelings\" with a venom that came near landing him in Fort Lafayette.\r\nThe writer was one of those \"hirelings,\" and, while \"sticking type\"\r\nin his office had many doubtless indiscreet arguments with the\r\naggressive editor on the issues of the day. Mr. Beebe seemed rather\r\npleased, not to say amused, at the temerity of the boy-printer, and\r\ngave him opportunity to expound his \"abolition heresies.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Civil War went on, the paper continually lost prestige, and\r\nwhen the venerable editor--broken-hearted in the lost cause--died in\r\n1872, the _Banner of Liberty_ became homeless. It was bought by the\r\nBenedict brothers, Thomas E. and Gilbert H., and was removed to\r\nEllenville. The writer's recollection is that it was later\r\ntransferred to Brooklyn, L. I., where it ceased to exist. On this\r\npoint, however, he may err; however, it did not long survive its\r\ntalented founder.\r\n\r\nGilbert J. Beebe also, in 1848, started another paper--the\r\n_Middletown Mercury._ This paper was less virulent than his _Banner\r\nof Liberty,_ and being devoted to local news, attained a considerable\r\ncirculation. In 1860 Mr. Beebe sold the _Mercury_ to James H. Norton,\r\nwho had been conducting the _Tri-States Union_ at Port Jervis. Mr.\r\nNorton associated with him in this purchase a young printer and ready\r\nwriter, Isaac F. Guiwits. The two were thoroughly practical men, and\r\nsoon made their personality and their good taste vividly apparent in\r\ntheir work. The _Mercury_ was enlarged, new type and machinery were\r\ninstalled, and it was not many months before the paper began to grow\r\nin circulation and in power. It got better and neater with each\r\nissue; its managers seemed to vie with each other in this work.\r\nWithin five years the _Middletown Mercury_ became famous for being\r\nthe handsomest newspaper in the United States. For those days, it was\r\na model of beauty. What is more, it became a leading newspaper; its\r\nlocal news was gotten up the best, much attention being paid to this\r\nfeature--practically an innovation in journalism, strange as this\r\nstatement may appear to newspaper men and readers to-day. Mr. Norton\r\nwas a democrat of the pro-slavery type, and his editorial utterances\r\nduring the war were often vitriolic, notwithstanding which the paper\r\nflourished, many paid-up republican subscribers contributing to its\r\nsuccess, admiring its journalistic features while cursing its\r\npolitics. In 1867 Isaac V. Montanye purchased an interest in the\r\npaper, and in 1868 became sole proprietor. In 1869 S. M. Boyd became\r\nits owner. In 1873 the _Middletown Mail_ was merged in the _Mercury,_\r\nwhen Dr. Joseph D. Friend and George H. Thompson became its editors\r\nand owners. Dr. Friend retired in 1874. In 1878 the _Weekly Argus_\r\nconsolidated with the _Mercury,_ which became the _Mercury and\r\nArgus._ In 1876 Cornelius Macardell and George H. Thompson became\r\nproprietors, with Mr. Thompson as editor, who continued thus until\r\nhis death in May, 1904. The _Mercury and Argus_ plant remains in the\r\nMacardell family, known as the Argus and Mercury Publishing Company,\r\nwith Cornelius Macardell, president; A. B. Macardell, vice-president\r\nand secretary; A. E. Nickinson, treasurer and general manager; A. B.\r\nMacardell, editor; Henry P. Powers and Horace A. MacGowan, city\r\neditors.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Thomas George began in Newburgh the publication of the\r\n_Newburgh Excelsior._ E. M. Ruttenber purchased this paper in May,\r\n1851, and merged it with his _Telegraph._\r\n\r\nIn January, 1850, appeared the first newspaper in Port Jervis, the\r\n_Port Jervis Express._ This journalistic venture deserves especial\r\nnotice from the fact that it was started by a colored man. P. H.\r\nMiller--the first publication of such distinction in Orange County,\r\nand possibly in the State. The _Express_ was well printed, and ably\r\nedited. But it died in October the same year.\r\n\r\nThe _Middletown Advertiser_ was started in Middletown in 1850 by\r\nG. J. Beebe. It was a monthly advertising sheet, and lived two years.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1850, Colonel Samuel Fowler--a leading citizen--started\r\nthe _Tri-States Union_ in Port Jervis. It was a democratic paper,\r\nwith John I. Mumford as editor. Lucius F. Barnes, a rising young\r\nlawyer of Milford, Pa., purchased the paper and edited it until\r\nAugust 10, 1854, when he sold it to James H. Norton. The latter sold\r\nthe paper in 1861, to G. W. Allen, of Honesdale, Pa., and Wallace W.\r\nFarnum, a deaf mute, of Port Jervis. The latter was a practical\r\nprinter, and remained in the office many years. It was under Allen\r\nand Farnum that the politics of the paper changed from democratic to\r\nrepublican. In 1862 Allen's interest in the paper was purchased by\r\nDaniel Holbrook, a recent graduate of Harvard College and fresh from\r\nthe position of principal of the school at the House of Refuge,\r\nRandall's Island, N. Y. Mr. Holbrook made it a lively republican\r\npaper, ably maintaining the Union cause during the Civil War then\r\nwaging. September 27, 1869, Mr. Holbrook sold the paper to Foster\r\n& Mitchell, of Chambersburg, Pa. In 1871 the paper was purchased by\r\nCharles St. John, Jr., William T. Doty, and Alfred E. Spooner. In\r\n1872 Mr. Spooner's interest was purchased by Erwin G. Fowler. All\r\nthrough this year the _Union_ was one of the foremost supporters of\r\nthe liberal republican movement that led to the nomination at\r\nCincinnati of the lamented Horace Greeley for President. Soon after\r\nGreeley's nomination the Union's proprietors issued _The\r\nWood-Chopper,_ a campaign paper which was full of fire and\r\nenthusiasm, but died with the ambitions of its martyred presidential\r\ncandidate. In January, 1873, Mr. Doty retired from the firm to take\r\ncharge of the _Gazette._ Mr. Fowler retired from the paper later in\r\nthe same year. In April, 1877, Fred R. Salmon, Mr. St. John's\r\nbrother-in-law, young and fresh from a commercial school, entered the\r\noffice as bookkeeper. He displayed aptitude and business qualities\r\nfrom the start--points Mr. St. John quickly recognized--and in 1884\r\nhe was made a member of the firm, which became St. John & Salmon, and\r\nthus remained until 1894, when the same members became the Tri-States\r\nPrinting Co. In May, 1895, the firm was incorporated as the\r\nTri-States Publishing Co., which it remains, though on October 1,\r\n1907, Mr. Salmon purchased Mr. St. John's interest and became sole\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the _Tri-States Union_ was changed from a weekly to\r\nsemi-weekly issue, but within a year or two was changed back to the\r\nweekly issue, which it continues. In 1871 it was changed from a folio\r\nto a quarto, which it remains.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1873, Mr. St. John started the _Port Jervis Daily Union._ It\r\nwas issued as a morning paper for a year or two, since which time it\r\nhas been an afternoon paper. It has been edited successively by Ed.\r\nH. Mott, E. A. Brown, Henry A. Van Fredenberg, E. G. Fowler, Fred R.\r\nSalmon, Charles O. Young, James Bennet, Charles A. Starr, Merritt C.\r\nSpeidel, and at present by W. T. Doty.\r\n\r\nOn November 26, 1851, John W. Hasbrouck issued at Middletown the\r\nfirst number of the weekly _Whig Press._ In March, 1868, Mr.\r\nHasbrouck sold the plant to Moses D. Stivers. In 1870 Albert\r\nKessinger bought a half interest in the paper, and the firm was\r\nStivers & Kessinger until August, 1872, when the junior member died.\r\nIn October, 1872, Mr. Stivers sold the plant to F. Stanhope Hill, who\r\nsold an interest to John W. Slauson, and the firm became Hill &\r\nSlauson. Mr. Hill sold his interest to Mr. Stivers July 1, 1873, and\r\nthe firm became Stivers & Slauson. In 1880 Mr. Stivers sold his\r\ninterest to Mr. Slauson, and Charles J. Boyd entered the firm under\r\nthe firm name of Slauson & Boyd. This continued until February, 1906,\r\nwhen the whole plant was sold to the Middletown Times Publishing Co.,\r\nand the familiar old _Press_ lost its identity in the _Times-Press._\r\nIt seemed lamentable to see this staunch old paper die. It was the\r\npet of that venerable and conscientious laborer in the literary\r\nfield, John W. Hasbrouck, and his estimable wife, Dr. Lydia Sayer\r\nHasbrouck. Both labored for years, literally side by side, in the\r\neditorial room and in the work-shop of the establishment, and they\r\nhad built up a fine property. Under its successive changes, in the\r\nhands of Messrs. Stivers, Slauson and Boyd the _Press_ had become one\r\nof the best country newspapers in the State. Its plant was very\r\nvaluable, with the most improved machinery, and the whole\r\nestablishment was shrewdly managed, the paper ably edited, and\r\nnothing but the menace of a distinguished rival could ever have\r\ninduced Messrs. Slauson and Boyd to consent to the disposal of so\r\nvaluable a plant.\r\n\r\nThe temperance agitation evidently struck Port Jervis heavily early\r\nin the fifties, for in June, 1852, J. L. Barlow and John Dow began\r\nthe publication of the _Mirror of Temperance._ This lived about\r\neighteen months.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 another temperance paper appeared in Port Jervis, when John\r\nWilliams issued _The Sentinel._ It died in 1855. Mr. Williams was a\r\npugnacious Englishman, and while his _Sentinel_ was still on guard,\r\nhe issued another temperance paper, in the fall of 1854, which he\r\ncalled _The Precursor of Temperance._\r\n\r\nWith the demise of the latter publication and the _Sentinel,_ in\r\n1855, the starting of temperance papers in Port Jervis ceased\r\nentirely. Whether this was due to the complete and perpetual\r\nreclamation of the place by the army of temperance agitators that\r\nswooped down upon it in the fifties, or to the belief that the\r\nwarfare was utterly hopeless, is not certain. Any way, the vanquished\r\n(or conquering?) John Williams shook the dust of the town from his\r\nheels and tarried long enough in Middletown to start the\r\n_Hardwareman's Newspaper,_ later the _Iron Age,_ in the office of the\r\n_Whig Press._\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the _Newburgh American_ was issued by R. P. L. Shafer. It had\r\na life of only three or four weeks.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, at the office of the _Whig Press_ in Middletown, John\r\nWilliams, who had wrestled with the liquor question in Port Jervis\r\nfor a few years, started out in a new line. He had Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHasbrouck print for him a trade journal--one of the earliest ventures\r\nof this kind in the country. He called it the _Hardwareman's\r\nNewspaper,_ and published it monthly. After three years its name was\r\nchanged to the _Iron Age,_ and it is published yet in New York by\r\nDavid Williams, son of its founder, and is one of the leading trade\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nA monthly of forty-eight pages was started in Newburgh in 1855 by\r\nR. B. Denton. It was called the _Literary Scrapbook._ Its life was\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nIf the temperance workers had abandoned the western end of the county\r\nas wholly reclaimed or as irreclaimable, they had an eye or two on\r\nthe eastern end of the district, and in March, 1856, Royal B.\r\nHancock, \"as agent for an association of gentlemen,\" started in\r\nNewburgh a temperance paper which he called the _Newburgh Times._ It\r\npassed into the hands of R. Bloomer & Son, who sold it to Alexander\r\nWilson, he to Charles Blanchard, and the latter, in 1867, turned it\r\ninto the _Newburgh Daily Democrat._ The latter failed in a few\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 in the Middletown _Whig Press_ office Mr. and Mrs. Hasbrouck\r\nbegan the publication of _The Sybil,_ a fortnightly quarto. It was\r\nedited by Mrs. Hasbrouck, and was a particularly bright, able,\r\nfearless publication. It was continued eight years.\r\n\r\nAn association of students in Domanski's school in Newburgh, in 1857\r\nstarted _The Acorn,_ a small but pretentious monthly of a literary\r\ncharacter. It lived about one year.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the winter of 1864 Eugene W. Gray began printing\r\nthe _Daily Union_ at Newburgh. It was really the _Daily Telegraph,_\r\nwhich had been suspended for a short time. In 1866 the title of both\r\nthe weekly and daily was changed to the _Press._ In 1869 the title of\r\n_Telegraph_ was restored, and in 1876 it became the _Register,_ which\r\ncontinued until February 24, 1908, when it suspended under financial\r\ndifficulties, and, as one paper expressed it, \"Too much\r\nanti-Bryanism.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary 27, 1866, Elder Leonard Cox, a practical printer, began\r\nprinting Warwick's second paper, which he called the _Warwick\r\nAdvertiser._ It was a five or six-column folio, neatly printed, well\r\nedited and newsy. To-day it is one of the best edited weekly\r\nnewspapers in the county. It is republican in politics--in fact, has\r\npractically always been so. January, 1869, Elder Cox sold the paper\r\nto John L. Servin, and moved to Virginia. April, 1874, it was\r\npurchased by Daniel F. Welling. He sold it to Stewart & Wilson\r\n(August 5, 1876), who sold it to Stewart & Demerest. The office was\r\nburned out January 24, 1879, after which it was published by Stewart\r\n& Co. Samuel J. Stewart was its editor until Hiram Tate came into\r\npossession of the property. Mr. Tate was a practical printer, and\r\nwas fresh from the office of Mr. and Mrs. John W. Hasbrouck's _Whig\r\nPress,_ and had good ideas of what a neat, live newspaper should\r\nbe--as generally had the graduates of Mr. and Mrs. Hasbrouck's school\r\nof practical journalism. It is still in Mr. Tate's possession.\r\n\r\nThough short-lived, a bright little specimen of ambitious young\r\njournalism appeared in Middletown in September, 1866. It was called\r\n_The Rising Sun,_ and was the first venture in this field by Stephen\r\nH. Sayer, a recent apprentice in the _Whig Press_ office. _The Rising\r\nSun_ was a literary effort--it might almost be claimed as one of the\r\nearliest of the amateur publications, except that its ambitious young\r\neditor had higher and more mature aims when, out of the environing\r\nnebulae he called into existence his little star of hope. It was a\r\nfour-column folio, printed from long primer and nonpareil type--the\r\ntwo tolerable extremes--and was listed at fifty cents a year. It was\r\nprinted in Coe Finch's job printing office at Franklin square in the\r\nthird floor of the building now occupied by the Middletown Savings\r\nBank. Mr. Sayer announced that \"_The Rising Sun_ is not a local\r\npaper, but will circulate throughout Maine, Kansas, Iowa, etc., with\r\nas much profit to subscribers there as in the State of New York.\" The\r\nwriter set type on the first issue of _The Rising Sun,_ and had a\r\nsort of god-fatherly interest in this promising luminary, and regrets\r\nthat one of the too common cataclysms in the journalistic empyrean\r\nover whelmed the bright little orb ere its rays had scintillated a\r\nsingle scintillation on either rock-ribbed Maine or bleeding Kansas.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Sayer was not extinguished, even if the light of his little\r\n_Rising Sun_ was dimmed forever. He was ambitious, and, what is more,\r\ndetermined. When he emerged from this celestial crash, he cast his\r\noptics over the universe, and discovered Montgomery, and forthwith\r\nhied him hither, and in April, 1868, issued the first number of the\r\n_Wallkill Valley Times,_ a seven or eight-column folio, of good\r\nappearance, newsy, and well edited. In 1869 he issued the _Dollar\r\nWeekly._ Both publications passed into the hands of Lester Winfield\r\nin 1871.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Mr. Sayer also started the _Walden Recorder,_ at Walden.\r\nChauncey B. Reed took it in 1870, and issued it as the _Walden\r\nRecorder-Herald._ Later he dropped the Recorder, and the paper has\r\nsince appeared as the Walden Herald.\r\n\r\nFrom these ventures Mr. Sayer went to Deckertown (now Sussex), N. J.,\r\nand started the _Sussex Independent,_ which has always been one of\r\nthe brightest newspapers in New Jersey. After retiring from the\r\n_Independent,_ Mr. Sayer joined the Texas colony of the seventies,\r\nand spent some years in the Lone Star State, farming, writing,\r\nediting, and making himself generally useful to the inhabitants of\r\nthe far-away empire of the southwest. He and his estimable family\r\nreturned to the north in the eighties, and he is now living in\r\nwell-earned retirement on the old farm, near New Vernon, surrounded\r\nby his amiable wife and remarkably bright children--the latter now\r\ngrown to maturity as useful and honored members of the community.\r\n\r\nOne of the marvels of success, for a few years, was Wood's _Household\r\nAdvocate,_ a monthly magazine, started in Newburgh by S. S. Wood in\r\n1867. Later the name was changed to _Household Magazine,_ and it\r\nattained a circulation of 60,000 copies. It died in 1874.\r\n\r\nLester Winfield started a paper at Galesville Mills, Ulster County,\r\nin May, 1864, which he removed to Pine Bush in September, 1868, under\r\nthe name of the _Pine Bush Weekly Casket._ The same month (September,\r\n1868), he continued the journey to Montgomery, and called the paper\r\nthe _Montgomery Republican._ Mr. Winfield succeeded in uniting his\r\n_Casket,_ his _Republican_ and Mr. Smith's _Standard_ into one\r\npublication, May 1, 1869, which he called the _Republican and\r\nStandard,_ which is continued to this day, as the _Montgomery\r\nStandard and Reporter._\r\n\r\nEarly in 1869 A. A. Bensel started at Newburgh the _Home, Farm and\r\nOrchard,_ an eight-page weekly. It was a bright, useful journal,\r\ndevoted to farm topics, and deserved the widest circulation, but it\r\ndied in the spring of 1876.\r\n\r\nApril 22, 1869, James H. Norton, of Middletown late of the _Mercury,_\r\nand William H. Nearpass, of Port Jervis, began the publication in\r\nPort Jervis of the first tri-weekly paper in this county. It was\r\ncalled The _Evening Gazette._ It was a five-column folio, printed\r\nfrom new bourgeois type. It was newsy, bright, chatty, and\r\nentertaining from the start. Within a few weeks The _Family Gazette_\r\nappeared from the same office, and was issued weekly. Within a year\r\nthe latter was enlarged and became the _Port Jervis Weekly Gazette._\r\nThe _Evening_ and the _Weekly Gazette_ soon attained big\r\ncirculations, and have since continued to reach a large class of\r\nreaders. Both were neutral in politics for years. Mr. Norton retired\r\nfrom the concern in 1871. Ed. H. Mott, of Honesdale, becoming\r\nassociated with Mr. Nearpass in the publishing and editing of the\r\npaper. October 1, 1872, George A. Clement, a young New York lawyer,\r\npurchased the establishment, and turned it into a Republican organ,\r\nsupporting General Grant in his second presidential campaign. July 1,\r\n1873, William T. Doty, of Port Jervis, and William R. Waller, of\r\nMonticello, leased the plant. Mr. Doty becoming editor and business\r\nmanager, and Mr. Waller taking charge of the mechanical department.\r\nIn 1874, Mr. Clement sold the plant to Jesse M. Connor, a Port Jervis\r\nmerchant, who, in turn, disposed of it to Hon. Charles St. John,\r\nex-congressman from this district. Soon afterward Mr. St. John sold\r\nthe plant to Ezra J. Horton, of Peekskill, and William T. Doty, and\r\nthe paper became democratic. In 1875 the co-partnership between Mr.\r\nHorton and Mr. Doty ended, Mr. Horton retiring, and in October, 1876,\r\nMr. St. John again became owner of the plant for two issues, when he\r\ndisposed of it to William H. Nearpass. The paper has since been\r\ndemocratic. W. T. Doty continued as editor for several years, being\r\nsucceeded by James J. Shier, of Middletown, and since his death, by\r\nMr. Nearpass as editor. Associated with Mr. Nearpass in the\r\nmanagement and ownership of the paper was Abram Shinier, A. M. May,\r\nJames J. Shier, and since the eighties the paper has been conducted\r\nby the Gazette Publishing Co., with W. H. Nearpass as president and\r\neditor, Evi Shinier as secretary and treasurer and business manager,\r\nwith Mark V. Richards as associate editor, and James Skellenger as\r\ncity editor. The tri-weekly edition was changed to an afternoon daily\r\nissue (except Sunday), and to an eight-column folio, January 17,\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1869, Isaac F. Guiwits started the first daily newspaper\r\nin Middletown. It was issued at four o'clock every afternoon, except\r\nSunday, and was printed at the office of the _Middletown Mercury,_\r\nthen located over what is now Hanford & Horton's news store on North\r\nstreet. It was a five-column folio, printed from brevier type, and\r\nwas a model of neatness, sprightliness, and paid much attention to\r\nlocal news. Mr. Guiwits was an elegant writer, brimful of wit--a\r\nthorough all-round printer and \"newspaper man,\" an apt pupil of the\r\nmaster journalistic mind, James H. Norton, and he made the _Daily\r\nMail_ a bright paper. But it didn't pay, as a daily, and April 28,\r\n1869, Mr. Guiwits issued the _Middletown Mail,_ a weekly publication\r\nof six columns (folio), this succeeding the _Daily Mail._\r\nSome months later Mr. Guiwits sold the _Mail_ plant to Evander B.\r\nWillis, a printer, stenographer, and reporter. A year or two later\r\nDr. Joseph D. Friend became the owner of the _Mail._ In 1873 he made\r\nan arrangement by which the _Mail_ was consolidated with the\r\n_Mercury,_ when Dr. Friend and George H. Thompson became the\r\nproprietors of the combined publication. The _Mail_ was a local\r\nnewspaper, with democratic tendencies, but it never cut much of a\r\nfigure in the newspaper life in the county, after it ceased to be a\r\ndaily, though Mr. Guiwits and Dr. Friend were both fine writers, and\r\nMr. Willis was popular. Dr. Friend, the genial, the easy-going, the\r\nfriend, has long since passed away, but his memory is ever green with\r\nthe few who yet linger--aye few--who associated with him in\r\njournalism in those early days. Mr. Guiwits went to Kansas City, and\r\nMr. Willis to California.\r\n\r\nThe second experiment of publishing a tri-weekly paper in Orange\r\nCounty began in the office of the _Orange County Press_ when Stivers &\r\nKessinger (Moses D. Stivers and Albert Kessinger), on May 24, 1870,\r\nissued the first number of the _Middletown Evening Press._ October\r\n26, 1872, the tri-weekly became a daily under the name of the\r\n_Middletown Daily Press,_ and continued until merged with the\r\n_Middletown Times_ in February, 1906, under the name of the\r\n_Middletown Times-Press._\r\n\r\nThe first journal to be issued at Cornwall, or Cornwall-on-the-Hudson\r\nwas called _The Cornwall Paper, a Local Record of Things New and\r\nOld._ It was published by P. P. Hazen, of Cornwall, in conjunction\r\nwith A. A. Bensel, of Newburgh, issue No. 1 appearing April 15, 1871.\r\nSo far as known no other issue of the paper ever appeared.\r\n\r\nMay 24, 1875, Miss S. J. A. Hussey started the _Cornwall Times,_\r\nwhich, lived six years.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Isaac V. Montanye started the _Middletown Argus,_ a weekly\r\npaper. It was merged with the _Mercury_ in 1876, and January 27,\r\n1876, the _Daily Argus_ came forth and still does valiant service.\r\nThe _Daily Argus_ was started by Cornelius Macardell, Sr., who had\r\nmoney as well as brains, and he made the _Argus_ and the _Mercury_\r\nlive democratic papers. George H. Thompson, who soon after leaving\r\ncollege became connected with the concern, and his ready pen and many\r\nother good newspaper qualities, soon won the attention of Mr.\r\nMacardell, who installed him as editor, which position he retained to\r\nhis death. The present editor is A. B. Macardell.\r\n\r\nAn association of printers in Newburgh in October, 1875, started the\r\n_Daily Penny Post,_ as a representative of labor and union interests.\r\nWhile the _Post_ was struggling for existence the _Daily Mail_ was\r\nstarted by a rival organization, in 1876. In June of the latter year\r\nthe _Post_ was discontinued, and having evidently accomplished its\r\npurpose, the _Mail_ merged, in 1877, with the _Register._\r\n\r\nIt was in 1876 that the _Newburgh Register_ came into existence,\r\nwith many vicissitudes and owners, as previously explained, but\r\nfinally emerging from the _Telegraph_ under the able management of\r\nthe lamented Edward M. Ruttenber. The _Register_ later passed into\r\nthe hands of Herbert P. Kimber & Co., who made of it a bright, newsy,\r\ndemocratic paper. Succeeding Mr. Kimber as editor were John A. Mason,\r\nFrancis Willard and A. L. Moffatt, the latter of whom fought the\r\nBryan element of the democratic party so vigorously that his\r\nretirement from the paper in 1907 was a matter of much rejoicing in\r\nthe ranks of the reigning element of the party in Orange County. The\r\nrecent editor of the _Register_ was John V. Tucker, whose utterances\r\nwere evidently more in harmony with the views of the democratic\r\ncounty committee. But the _Register_ suspended publication February\r\n24, 1908.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the _Cornwall Reflector_ was started by John Lee. Later H. H.\r\nSnelling became editor. The paper lived until the latter part of\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 James C. Merritt started the _Cornwall Mirror_ at Highland\r\nFalls. In 1895 it was merged with the _Cornwall Local._\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 1880, appeared in Port Jervis the first number of the\r\n_Sunday Morning Call._ It was a five-column quarto, neatly printed,\r\nably edited, and destined, as its first number indicated, to make a\r\nstir in local social, political and religious circles. It was\r\npublished by Erwin G. Fowler and A. L. Moffatt, with Mr. Fowler as\r\neditor. The latter was bright, witty, ready and fearless, and he\r\ngirded on his editorial armor and leaped into the arena of local\r\npolemics with an ardor and a fearlessness that, for a time, set the\r\ntown in a furor. He attacked the validity of the bond issue for the\r\nMonticello railroad, and came near having the bonds repudiated by the\r\npeople in accordance with court decisions in similar cases. His\r\niconoclasm aroused the frenzy of those most exposed to his vitriolic\r\nassaults, and they sought to muzzle his _Call,_ with the result that\r\nthe last issue of his fearless paper appeared in December of the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nApril 23, 1881, appeared in Middletown the _Liberal Sentinel,_ an\r\nindependent weekly quarto, with John W. and Mrs. Lydia Hasbrouck as\r\neditors. The paper was never profitable to them, but it enabled these\r\ntwo benevolent people to again take up, for a time, the battle for\r\nhuman rights--a struggle in which they had practically sacrificed the\r\nbloom of their youth and the fruition of years. Mr. Hasbrouck has\r\ngone to his reward, after a life of struggle, in his own quiet,\r\nunassuming way, with the adverse forces of environment for the\r\nbetterment of humanity. His noble, self-sacrificing companion through\r\nyears, yet lives, a martyr to conventionality, a lover of the good,\r\nthe pure, the true. May her declining days be as peaceful and as\r\nbeautiful as the summer flowers that shed their fragrance and their\r\nluster around her own beautiful habitation on Linden avenue's fair\r\nlawn.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of September, 1881, was issued at Port Jervis in the\r\noffice of the Tri-States Publishing Co., the first number of the\r\n_Orange County Farmer._ It was a six-column quarto, and, as its name\r\nindicates, was devoted to the interests of the farmer, dairyman, and\r\npomologist. The idea was one of the many conceptions of the fertile\r\nbrain of Charles St. John, Jr., then the head of the Tri-States\r\nPublishing Co., a former supervisor of the town of Deer Park, a son\r\nof former Congressman Hon. Charles St. John, a young man who, ere he\r\nwas out of his teens, was a leader in all the athletic sports of his\r\nnative village, Port Jervis, active, energetic in business, and\r\nbrimful of plans and ideas. He was one of the leaders in the county\r\nin the liberal republican movement that, in 1872, led to the\r\nnomination of Horace Greeley for President, and made the _Tri-States\r\nUnion_ and the campaign publication, _The Woodchopper,_ red-hot\r\nchampions of the Sage of Chappaqua. In starting the _Orange County\r\nFarmer_ Mr. St. John built far better than he knew, as subsequent\r\nevents proved. The first number was, editorially, the joint\r\nproduction of himself and his brother-in-law, Fred R. Salmon, then a\r\nbookkeeper in the office of the _Tri-States Union._ Mr. Salmon had\r\nbeen active in the business department, but developed talent in\r\nconnection with reportorial and editorial lines, and did some clever\r\nagricultural work for the first and for many succeeding issues of the\r\n_Farmer._ He was for some time known as managing editor of _The\r\nFarmer,_ though after the first issue Erwin G. Fowler, late of the\r\n_Sunday Call,_ and a former editor of the _Daily Union_ and of the\r\n_Middletown Press,_ and a lover of horticultural matters, became the\r\nactive editor of _The Farmer,_ with Mr. Salmon as the business\r\nmanager. Under this joint control, with more or less supervision of\r\nMr. St. John, _The Farmer_ rapidly grew in popularity, in\r\ncirculation, and in influence. In 1890 Mr. Fowler and John J. Dillon,\r\nthen connected with the office and now manager of the _Rural New\r\nYorker,_ purchased _The Husbandman,_ an agricultural paper at Elmira,\r\nand both retired from _The Farmer._ Mr. Fowler's successor was\r\nWilliam T. Doty, and Mr. Dillon's successor in the business\r\ndepartment was William F. Wade, now of the _Rural New Yorker._ In\r\n1894 Mr. Fowler was again on _The Farmer's_ editorial staff and\r\nremained until 1897, when declining health forced his retirement--and\r\nhis death in 1904 deprived the literary and agricultural world of one\r\nof its brightest workers, the social world of one of the most\r\namiable, lovable, benevolent members, and Orange County's musical set\r\nan able leader.\r\n\r\nMr. Fowler's successor on _The Farmer_ was Henry A. Van Fredenberg,\r\nfor years editor of the _Milling World_ and the _Lumber World,_ both\r\nof Buffalo. Mr. Van Fredenberg was born in Montague, N. J., was\r\neducated in the schools of Port Jervis, early became a school\r\nteacher, and had charge of the schools at Sussex (then Deckertown),\r\nN. J., when he entered the editorial harness on the _Sussex\r\nIndependent,_ and developed rare talent, which quickly secured his\r\nrecognition as a writer, a paragrapher, reporter, and editor. When\r\nhe was called to the editorial chair of the _Orange County Farmer_ he\r\nhad years of editorial experience, was a botanical scholar, a\r\nmarvelous linguist, a proficient mathematician, had a rare knowledge\r\nof chemistry, geology and pomology, and was a careful student in\r\ndairy and agricultural matters generally. That _The Farmer_ has\r\nprospered beyond all expectations under his wise and able editorial\r\nmanagement is not saying too much. Started as a county agricultural\r\npaper, it steadily grew out of its local bounds into State\r\nreputation, and then into national and now into international\r\nimportance, with a circulation now (March, 1908), quoted at 25,000,\r\nwith subscribers in almost every civilized country in the world,\r\nbesides going into every State in the Union. It is quoted everywhere,\r\nits editorial utterances and contributions are transferred to other\r\ntongues, and it is recognized as one of the leading dairy journals of\r\nthe world. This marvelous growth and influence outside its own county\r\nled its managers to change its title in 1897, when it became\r\n_The New York Farmer,_ as more expressive of its character and the\r\nscope of its work and operations. At this time (March, 1908), Mr.\r\nVan Fredenberg is still the editor, and _The Farmer_ is now a\r\nseven-column quarto, issued on Wednesday of each week.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 James J. McNally, the veteran newspaper man of Orange County,\r\nstarted at Monroe a weekly seven-column folio, the _Monroe Herald._\r\nIn 1888 he started at Goshen the _Goshen News,_ and printed both\r\npapers at Goshen until the spring of 1892, when he died, and both\r\npublications ceased.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 _The News_ was started in Middletown as a Sunday paper by\r\nthat veteran journalist, James H. Norton. Associated with him was\r\nCharles H. Conkling, a practical printer, and later W. T. Doty, whom\r\nMr. Norton induced to take a hand in the editorial work. _The News_\r\ntook an active interest in exploiting the farmer's interests during\r\nthe famous \"milk war\" which waged in that year, when milk was spilled\r\ncopiously in the Middletown streets and elsewhere, when encountered\r\nin surreptitious transfer to some unpopular dealer. _The News_ was\r\nan eight-column folio, nicely printed, and attained a considerable\r\ncirculation. Mr. Norton, and later Mr. Doty, retired from the\r\nconcern, and the material was sold to Mrs. Hasbrouck, later to\r\nLawyer Reid, who issued a few copies of _The Jeffersonian,_ then to\r\nIsaac V. Montanye, who issued a few numbers of a labor paper, and\r\nfinally the material was purchased by James J. McNally, to be merged\r\nwith the _Monroe Herald_ and the _Goshen News._\r\n\r\nIn 1885 St. John & Salmon issued at Port Jervis _The Farm Guide,_ a\r\nmonthly of eight, twelve and sixteen pages. It did not live long.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1885, George F. Ketchum started at Warwick the _Warwick\r\nValley Dispatch._ It was an eight-column folio at first, and was\r\nafterward enlarged to a nine-column folio which it is at present. In\r\n1889 a half interest in the paper was sold to I. W. Litchfield, Mr.\r\nKetchum retaining control of the editorial policy. In 1894 Mr.\r\nLitchfield engaged in other business, Mr. Ketchum taking over his\r\ninterest, which he still retains as sole controller of the paper and\r\nits policy. The _Dispatch_ has always been democratic in its politics,\r\nand for some years has been the leading--in fact, the main or\r\nonly--exponent of the aggressive democracy represented by the Bryan\r\nforces in that party. Mr. Ketchum has been for several years chairman\r\nof the democratic county committee, and that he has proven himself an\r\nable editor and sagacious, fearless leader is evidenced by the growth\r\nin popularity of his paper, and the endorsement in growing\r\naggressiveness of his course as leader of the democracy of the county\r\nand chairman of the county committee.\r\n\r\n_The Daily News_ was started in Newburgh as a penny daily, in 1885,\r\nby William H. Keefe, who had been for many years the city editor of\r\nthe _Newburgh Daily Journal._ The paper had its inception amid modest\r\nsurroundings, but what its founder lacked in material resources,\r\nhowever, he made up for in aggressiveness, enterprise and\r\nversatility. The vigorous style of the newcomer in the journalistic\r\nfield caught the public fancy at the very start, and the paper soon\r\nattained a large circulation and became a financial success.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Keefe died in February, 1901, and the business was carried\r\non by the Newburgh News Printing and Publishing Co., which had been\r\norganized several years prior to his death. Mr. F. W. Wilson is its\r\npresent able editor.\r\n\r\n_The News_ soon outgrew the meager mechanical facilities and\r\nrestricted surroundings amid which it first saw the light, and in\r\n1902 the plant was moved to its present home in the handsome building\r\nat 40 and 42 Grand street, which it purchased and remodeled for its\r\nown purpose. The installation of a still more modern and up-to-date\r\nequipment marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the\r\npaper, and successful as it had been up to that time, it has been\r\nstill more so since.\r\n\r\nThe _Newburgh Daily News_ of to-day is concededly one of the leading\r\nnewspapers of the Hudson River valley, not only in circulation, but\r\nalso in influence. It is splendidly equipped, and is not surpassed by\r\nany newspaper in a city of equal size anywhere. Its plant represents\r\na large investment of capital and it carries on its pay-roll upwards\r\nof fifty employees.\r\n\r\nThe handsome building, the modernly equipped plant, the large\r\ncirculation and volume of advertising all indicate that the _News_\r\nenjoys the support and large patronage of the community in which it\r\nis published and to which it is a distinct credit.\r\n\r\n_The Daily Evening Press_ was established in Newburgh in 1888, as a\r\ndemocratic organ, by James G. Dunphy. Mr. Dunphy was born in\r\nNewburgh, August 21, 1842, and learned his trade under the late E. M.\r\nRuttenber. For many years he conducted the _Press_ with an ability\r\nwhich brought success and secured it a great influence throughout the\r\ncounty. After a considerable period of prosperity, however, a blight\r\nseemed to fall upon the printing plant, and although for some time\r\nMr. Dunphy struggled bravely against ever-increasing obstacles, he\r\nwas finally obliged to give up the losing fight, and the _Press_\r\njoined the large company of other Orange County organs which had\r\nflourished for a season and then passed silently from the scene.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 St. John & Salmon started in Port Jervis a small quarto\r\ncalled _Sunbeams._ It was a semi-humorous publication, but the\r\nquality or quantity of its revelry failed somehow to attack the\r\nrisibles of a sufficient clientele of the American public, and its\r\nweary publishers concluded to let the prosaic citizens plod on in\r\ntheir own dull, flat, Boeotian way.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 N. E. Conkling & Co. started at Chester the _Orange County\r\nNews,_ a weekly, six-column folio, with N. E. Conkling as editor. It\r\nwas an independent paper, giving much attention to local news. At\r\ntimes the paper published editions for Unionville and Pine Bush. In\r\nFebruary, 1908, the plant was sold to J. B. Gregory, and removed to\r\nMonroe, where the latter started the _Ramapo Valley Gazette,_ March,\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1888, the _Cornwall Local_ appeared at Cornwall-on-Hudson,\r\nunder the management of H. A. Gates. In September, 1889, he disposed\r\nof the plant to C. P. Brate, of Albany, who installed his\r\nbrother-in-law, Thomas Pendall, a practical printer and bright\r\nwriter, as editor and publisher. In June, 1892, the _Local_ came\r\nunder the management of Lynn G. Goodenough, by whom it is still\r\nconducted. The paper was classed as independent politically until it\r\ncame into Mr. Goodenough's possession. In 1896 he made the _Local_ a\r\nrepublican paper, and as such it became a useful and influential\r\nmember of Orange County republican newspaperdom. Recently the name\r\nof the paper became the _Local-Press,_ as more significant of a\r\nnewspaper than the name _Local._ In 1895 Mr. Goodenough purchased Mr.\r\nMerritt's right, title and good will in the _Cornwall Mirror,_ and\r\nconsolidated that publication with the _Local._\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the _Walden Citizen_ came into existence. It is a six-column\r\nquarto, republican in politics, well edited by J. H. Reed, and is a\r\nnewsy and meritorious publication.\r\n\r\nA valuable monthly publication was begun in Port Jervis in 1888, when\r\n_Church Life_ was issued. It was printed under the auspices of the\r\nReformed church of that place. It usually appeared in eight pages,\r\nwith two and three broad columns to a page. Its work was largely that\r\nof gathering up local historical matters, and one of its most\r\nvaluable contributors was William H. Nearpass, whose penchant in that\r\ndirection enabled him to furnish much valuable historical\r\ninformation that otherwise might have been lost to all generations.\r\nAnother contributor was the Rev. S. W. Mills, D.D., for many years\r\npastor of the Reformed Church of Deer Park. The paper was issued for\r\nabout fifteen years, but why it was allowed to cease no one connected\r\nwith the church seems to know. It was printed at the _Gazette_\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe _Orange County Dairyman_ was started at Middletown in the office\r\nof the _Mercury and Argus,_ in December, 1888. The publishers were\r\nMacardell, Thompson and Barrett (Cornelius Macardell, Sr., George H.\r\nThompson, and Leon Barrett, the artist.) Its editor was W. C. Cairns,\r\nof Rockland, Sullivan County, better known as \"Rusticus.\" The\r\n_Dairyman_ was a five or six-column quarto. It never became\r\nprofitable, and went out of existence in January, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe only Sunday paper of the four or more started in this county that\r\nseemed to have vitality enough to come down to our day was the\r\n_Telegram_ of Newburgh. It was started in 1889 by Edward M.\r\nRuttenber, the venerable and learned printer, editor, author and\r\nhistorian, who lately passed to his great reward, mourned by all, and\r\nbeloved and revered by those who knew him best. The _Telegram_ is now\r\npublished by J. W. F. Ruttenber, son of its founder. Though started\r\nas a Sunday paper, it is now issued on Saturday, and is known as _The\r\nNewburgh Telegram._ It is ably conducted, as it always has been. A\r\nfree lance in principle, it is fearless in its assaults, and\r\nsometimes makes things very interesting for residents of the\r\nHillside city and its purlieus.\r\n\r\nOne of the publications that made a sensation at its starting, and\r\nduring its entire career was a subject of wide interest, was called\r\n_The Conglomerate._ It was started June 15, 1890, by patients in the\r\nState Homeopathic Hospital at Middletown. The first number was a\r\nfour-column folio, but it soon grew to a quarto, and its circulation\r\nincreased until, at its zenith, over 3,000 copies were issued. It\r\ncirculated in all parts of America, had subscribers in New Zealand,\r\nand in fact in nearly every country, and its articles were copied\r\neverywhere. _The Conglomerate_ stood for reform in lunacy matters,\r\nand for this reason, and because of its too outspoken policy against\r\nthe State's lunacy commission, the authorities caused its suspension.\r\nIt was gotten out entirely at the State Hospital, where a\r\nfully-equipped newspaper and job-printing office was established by\r\nthe patients under whose tutelage it was called into existence. Its\r\npages were full of bright things. Not only were its editorials able,\r\nbut its contributions were from brilliant minds, the names of whose\r\nwriters, for obvious reasons, are withheld. It ceased publication in\r\n1897, after a brilliant career, during which it was eagerly sought,\r\nread with avidity, and was a force for good throughout its whole\r\nbrief career.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of April 29, 1881, appeared in Middletown one of the\r\ncounty's--aye, one of the State's--marvels of journalistic success\r\nunder the title of the _Middletown Daily Times._ The first numbers\r\nwere issued from the Hasbrouck printing office in the Hasbrouck\r\nblock, corner of North and Depot streets, and was a seven-column\r\nfolio. While it announced that Lewis S. Stivers and John D. Stivers\r\nwere editors and proprietors, it was understood that ex-Congressman\r\nthe Hon. Moses Dunning Stivers, their father, stood sponsor for the\r\npublication, and this able writer and shrewd politician soon made his\r\npersonality evident in every issue of the _Times._ Rapidly did the\r\npaper gain in circulation, in influence, and in popular confidence.\r\nCongressman Stivers was a man of pronounced personality, had a way of\r\nwinning friends and retaining them, and with the recent expiration of\r\na successful term in Congress he was in position to build up a\r\npowerful country newspaper plant. And that is just what he did. In\r\nthis work he was most ably assisted by his two sons, whose names\r\nappeared at the head of the editorial columns. Lewis S. Stivers was a\r\npractical printer, a pressman, and a thorough, all-round mechanical\r\nexpert; young, with a love for the trade--credited by all printers as\r\nbeing not only practical but one of the most capable men in the\r\nState. His brother, John D. Stivers, had been his father's private\r\nsecretary all through his congressional career, had acquitted himself\r\nwith entire credit, and having been \"brought up\" in a printing\r\noffice, was well qualified to enter the editorial department of the\r\nestablishment. As a reporter, as one ready and quick to grasp the\r\nimportance of legitimate news, he proved his fitness for the position\r\nby keeping the _Times_ in the lead in its local and general news\r\ndepartments. It was under such auspicious conditions that _The\r\nMiddletown Daily News_ presented itself to the public every afternoon\r\nin the week, except Sunday, and its rapid growth in favor was the\r\nfulfillment of the auguries of those who best knew its esteemed\r\nsponsor and its managers. Within a short time the establishment was\r\nremoved to the first floor on the James and Henry street corner of\r\nthe Casino block. Here it remained until it was removed to its\r\npresent quarters at the corner of King and Center streets, in the\r\nhandsome four-story brick building of its own, and known as the Times\r\nbuilding or Stivers block. Here are fast presses, three Mergenthaler\r\nLinotype machines and all the necessary accouterments to enable the\r\nmanagement to issue one of the best daily newspapers in this country,\r\noutside of the larger cities. Its circulation is now daily\r\nconsiderably over 5,000 copies. The death of the Hon. M. D. Stivers\r\nand later of his son, Louis S. Stivers, removed two of the brightest\r\nmembers of the Orange County newspaperdom, and necessitated\r\nreorganization of the Times Publishing Co., which is now known as the\r\nStivers Printing Company, with John D. Stivers as president and Dr.\r\nM. A. Stivers as secretary and treasurer. On February 11, 1906, the\r\n_Middletown Daily Press_ merged with the _Times_ and the combination\r\nhas since issued as the _Middletown Times-Press._ The editorial\r\nwriter on the _Times_ and _Times-Press_ since November 1, 1905, has\r\nbeen A. W. Russell, whose bright, well-put comments are one of the\r\nfeatures that commend this widely-read journal.\r\n\r\nThe _News of Highlands_ was started at Highland Falls in 1891. It is\r\npublished on Saturdays by F. F. & A. G. Tripp, and is politically\r\nindependent or neutral.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1892, appeared in Port Jervis the _Port Jervis Morning\r\nIndex,_ the second attempt in that place to establish a morning\r\ndaily. It was started by Isaac V. Montanye, of Goshen, and Sherwood\r\nRightmyer, his nephew; was an eight-column folio, independent, or\r\nrather neutral, in politics, Mr. Montanye being a democrat and Mr.\r\nRightmyer a republican. The _Index_ was newsy, and well edited, but\r\nceased publication in August of the same year.\r\n\r\nMiddletown seems to have been the theatre of the sensational in\r\nOrange County journalism. The _Banner of Liberty,_ the _Whig Press_\r\n(whose editor was once caned in the streets for a bit of\r\nfacetiousness); the _Sybil,_ the _Mercury,_ the _Mail,_ the\r\n_Standard,_ the _News,_ the _Liberal Sentinel,_ the _Labor Advocate,_\r\nthe _Conglomerate_--each had its day of riotous jest or caustic\r\ninvective that set the town \"by the ears\" for a time.\r\n\r\nThe latest one to enter this field of humor, sarcasm and expletive\r\nwas _The Forum,_ the first number of which was issued February 28,\r\n1897, by W. T. Doty and H. W. Corey, and which, within a few weeks,\r\nexpanded into the _Middletown Sunday Forum._ The first few numbers\r\nwere printed in New York for the publishers by one of the \"patent\r\ninside\" concerns, and the warmth of its reception was such that its\r\nproprietors felt justified in putting in a plant of their own. The\r\noffice at first was in the business office of the Casino building,\r\nin the second floor, but was later transferred to the first floor of\r\nthe rear of the same building on Henry street. From the unique\r\n\"greeting\" in the first issue, the following excerpt is made as\r\ncharacteristic of the purposes, course and whole conduct of the\r\npublication:\r\n\r\n\"There are a number of reasons why we have concluded to publish _The\r\nForum._ First, we want to publish it. Second, there are a number of\r\npeople who don't want us to publish it. Third, there seems need of a\r\npublication in this city that will call a spade a spade. Fourth, we\r\ncan stop it when we want to. Being able to stop publishing it, if we\r\nwant to, encouraged us in the idea of starting.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was started, and with a pace that took the whole county by\r\nstorm. It was exultant, exuberant, jocular, sarcastic, hilarious, but\r\nnever whining, simpering, brawling or lachrymose. It had features\r\nsuch as no other paper in the county had, and all these peculiarities\r\nbrought it into wider and wider notoriety, and the editions printed\r\nalmost invariably fell short of supplying the demand. A leading\r\nfeature was the \"sermons\" of \"Pastor\" Corey. There was a vein of the\r\nkeenest irony in them, generally of more or less local application,\r\nand the demand for these lively satires extended to all classes of\r\ncitizens--those the severest hit as well as those who, from a safe\r\n\"coign of vantage,\" liked to watch the unique assaults. Another of\r\nits peculiar features was the holding up to ridicule of the driveling\r\n\"items\" and personals sent in by so many cross-roads correspondents\r\nof country papers, and which were generally the clever work of\r\n\"Deacon\" Peter F. Kaufman, a local real estate man who always looked\r\non the \"funny side\" of all events. The unfortunate and severe illness\r\nof Mr. Corey necessitated the abandonment of the \"sermons.\" The\r\nconcern was sold (December, 1897), to Frank L. Blanchard, of New\r\nYork, and later (1898) to W. T. Doty and Thomas Pendell, of Cornwall.\r\nThe latter two ran out a daily, _The Morning Forum,_ for some months,\r\nin 1898. Then Mr. Pendall purchased the outfit, and transferred it to\r\nMassena, N. Y. During the two or three years in which _The Forum_\r\nlived in Middletown it \"cut a wide swath,\" and kept the whole\r\nsurrounding country wondering \"what next?\" and, had it continued as\r\nit began, would have landed its proprietors--who were getting a pile\r\nof fun out of the proceeding--in the ranks of the multi-millionaires\r\nor in the penitentiary. A unique financial feature of the experiment\r\nwas the fact that the paper more than paid its own way from the very\r\nfirst issue.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1898, S. T. Morehouse started at Cornwall-on-Hudson the\r\n_Cornwall Courier._ This was conducted by various parties, including\r\nMr. Morehouse and his son, Claude, by the well-known writer Creswell\r\nMcLaughlin, Bernard Call, Clark J. Brown, Clayton Brown, and William\r\nClark, and in 1906, ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe _Orange County Record_ was started at Washingtonville, May 17,\r\n1899, by the Hon. Isaac V. Montanye (since deceased, December 26,\r\n1906) and his nephew, Montanye Rightmyer. Since the death of Mr.\r\nMontanye, Mr. Rightmyer is the editor and publisher. The paper is\r\ndevoted to local news.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1908, J. B. Gregory started at Monroe the _Ramapo Valley\r\nGazette._ The plant was that of the _Orange County News_ at Chester,\r\nthe paper started in 1888 by N. E. Conkling.\r\n\r\n                       MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned so-called \"regular publications,\"\r\nthere have been numerous amateur, church, society, labor,\r\nsemi-literary, and other more or less sporadic productions\r\nthroughout the county from the time of the introduction of printing\r\ninto the county at Goshen in 1788 to the present time.\r\n\r\nAn enterprise of importance that may be classed under this heading\r\nwas that of the Franklin Printing Company, starting in Middletown, in\r\n1879. At the head of the concern were James H. Norton, Isaac F.\r\nGuiwits, of Middletown and William H. Nearpass, of Port Jervis. A\r\nconsiderable building was erected on Mill street, Middletown, next to\r\nthe residence of Mr. Norton, and several presses and a finely\r\nequipped printing establishment was installed, to print \"patent\r\ninsides.\" A big business was there built up, and continued until the\r\npurchase and absorption of the plant by the New York Newspaper Union,\r\nand the transfer of the same to that city.\r\n\r\nFrom 1884 to 1886 the United States Official Postal Guide for New\r\nYork City was printed by W. H. Nearpass at the Port Jervis _Gazette_\r\noffice. Anthony M. May & Co. had the contract for this work.\r\n\r\nAbout 1886-7 lawyer T. A. Reid, of Middletown, amused himself for a\r\nfew months with a paper he called _The Jeffersonian._\r\n\r\nSoon after, the Rev. Charles M. Winchester, a Free Methodist, came to\r\nMiddletown, probably in 1879, he started a daily paper which he\r\ncalled _The Standard_ or _The Standard-Bearer._ It was published in\r\nthe interests of the temperance cause, and made a considerable\r\nexcitement during the eight or ten months of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe Pine Bush _Herald_ is a lateral production of the Walden\r\n_Herald,_ and dates from 1904, with George W. Jamison as editor.\r\n\r\n_Town Life_ was a weekly issued in Middletown from June, 1904, to\r\nJanuary, 1905, by Nelson W. Dix. It was a humorous publication with\r\nillustrations by the young publisher, who has a taste and a\r\nremarkable aptitude for drawing and cartoon work.\r\n\r\nThe _Orange County Magazine_ was started in Newburgh in 1906, and in\r\nthe same year the Goshen _Independent Republican_ issued a side\r\nedition called the _Chester Independent Republican,_ with George W.\r\nBall as editor.\r\n\r\nThe first number of the _St. Paul's Herald_ was issued in August,\r\n1892, and each month thereafter for about one year. It contained\r\neight pages, 9 by 12 inches to a page, and a cover. The _Herald_ was\r\nissued in the interest of St. Paul's M. E. Church, and Middletown\r\nMethodism. The editor and proprietor was Henry P. Powers, the present\r\nCity Editor of the Middletown _Argus,_ and it was printed at the\r\n_Times_ office.\r\n\r\n_The Worker's Advocate_ was started in Middletown about 1903, and\r\nconducted several years by W. H. McCarter, as an independent weekly\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n_The Church Helper_ was issued under auspices of Drew M. E. Church in\r\nPort Jervis, for about one year. The first number appeared in June,\r\n1889. It was a monthly, devoted almost exclusively to church and\r\ntemperance work.\r\n\r\n_The Parish Monthly_ has been issued since 1906 by sanction of the\r\nRev. John J. Morris, pastor of the Church of the Immaculate\r\nConception in Port Jervis. It is a two-column folio, printed by P. J.\r\nGaudy, Port Jervis, for the dissemination of local church news.\r\n\r\n_The Golden Rod_ is a monthly issued by Frederick Arthur Gates, M.A.,\r\npastor of the Ridgebury Presbyterian church, and printed at the\r\noffice of the Middletown _Times-Press._ The Associate Editor is Mary\r\nC. Clark, with a corps of correspondents. It contains 10 pages and a\r\ncover, with two columns to a page, and with a subscription price of\r\n25 cents a year. It has some local news and advertisements, but is\r\ndevoted mainly to church and temperance work. It was started in\r\nJanuary, 1907.\r\n\r\n                      AMATEUR PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe county has seen the birth and death of many amateur publications.\r\nThe first in the county, so far as now known, and believed to be one\r\nof the first in the whole country, was issued in Port Jervis in 1862.\r\nIt was called _The Tiger._ It was a diminutive production of four\r\nsmall pages, and was printed on one of the Adams Amateur presses, one\r\nof the first made, and the type, furnished by the same concern, was\r\nset by the energetic young publisher, William Henry Nearpass. _The\r\nTiger_ was issued semi-occasionally, to suit the whim or convenience\r\nof the publisher, for two or three years. Mr. Nearpass was then a\r\nclerk in the grocery and dry goods store of Charles St. John, at the\r\ncorner of Pike and West Main streets. Mr. Nearpass was then about\r\ntwenty-two years of age.\r\n\r\nNewburgh has had many of these amateur prints, beginning in 1875.\r\nAmong them may be mentioned the following: _Union Jack, American\r\nEagle, The Comet, The Index, The Collector, The Packet, The Laurel,\r\nThe Amateur Herald._\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Port Jervis had the _Amateur Guide,_ and in 1880 _The\r\nCricket._\r\n\r\n_Academy Miscellany_ was started by the Port Jervis high school\r\nstudents in March, 1889, and was discontinued in May, 1895. It was a\r\nmonthly publication, of eight pages, with two broad columns to a\r\npage, was devoted to school matters almost exclusively, and was a\r\nbright publication.\r\n\r\n_The Owl_ is a bright twenty-page monthly issued by the Middletown\r\nhigh school students, and printed at the office of the _Times-Press._\r\nIt has been issued for several years, and is a particularly\r\ncommendable school publication, both for the neatness with which it\r\nis gotten out, the literary character of its contents, and the\r\nbusiness-like character of the publication. The present editor is\r\nJames A. Rorty, the business manager, E. C. Faulkner.\r\n\r\nDuring 1897 _The Union School Journal_ was published by Merritt C.\r\nSpeidel, now of the Tri-States Publishing Co., Port Jervis, and Hugh\r\nM. Cox, now a practicing physician in New York City, who were the\r\neditors and managers. It had 12 pages of 10 by 12 inches, three\r\ncolumns to a page, and had a circulation of 500. The publication was\r\ndevoted to the interests of the schools and to matters of a general\r\neducational nature. The paper had the official sanction of the school\r\nauthorities, and many prominent Orange County writers contributed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n                 The Publications of the County.\r\n\r\n                         IN ANCIENT GOSHEN.\r\n\r\nThe _Goshen Repository_ was issued in 1788, by David Mandeville and\r\nDavid M. Westcott, at the Goshen Academy. The nature of the\r\npublication seems now unknown; nor is the size of the publication,\r\nor its character. In 1793 its office was near the court house. In\r\n1800 it was sold to John G. and William Heurtin, thus showing a life\r\nof twelve years--a much better showing than that made by many of its\r\nsuccessors there and elsewhere. Messrs. Heurtin changed its name to\r\nthe _Orange County Patriot,_ and in 1801 William Heurtin sold his\r\ninterest to William A. Carpenter, when the name was changed to _The\r\nFriend of Truth._ In 1804 it passed to the ownership of Ward M.\r\nGazlay or Gazley, and again its name was changed. This time it became\r\nthe _Orange Eagle._ A fire in 1805 in the office singed the _Eagle's_\r\nfeathers, but it was enabled to move about, and took its flight to\r\nNewburgh, where it became the _Political Index._\r\n\r\nTaking its name from an extinct Newburgh paper, Gabriel Denton, in\r\n1804, issued the _Orange County Gazette._ Edward M. Ruttenber traces\r\nits history to Elliott Hopkins in 1807, to Elliott Hopkins & Co. in\r\n1811, to Elliott Hopkins in 1812. to F. J. & A. D. Houghton in 1813,\r\nand to 1818, when it was \"printed and published for the proprietor.\"\r\nHow long after this it lasted is not known.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Gabriel Denton started the _Orange County Patriot and Spirit\r\nof Seventy-six._ It was doubtless a patriotic publication, probably a\r\njingo organ firing the American heart for another struggle with Great\r\nBritain, which came in 1812. In 1811 it was removed to Newburgh by\r\nLewis & Crowell, where it was published as a \"new series.\" T. B.\r\nCrowell became its publisher, and announced that its columns were\r\n\"open to all parties\" but were \"influenced by none.\" In 1822 Mr.\r\nCrowell moved the paper back to Goshen, and sold it to R. C. S.\r\nHendrie, who, February 22, 1834, sold it to F. T. Parson, who changed\r\nits name to the _Goshen Democrat._ In 1842 Charles Mead associated\r\nwith Mr. Parson. Nathaniel Webb secured Mr. Parson's interest, and\r\nthe firm became Mead & Webb, and later Charles Mead & Son, after the\r\ndeath of Mr. Webb. In 1843 R. C. S. Hendrie started the _True Whig,_\r\ntwo years later selling it to Charles Mead, who merged it with his\r\npaper under the title of _The Goshen Democrat and Whig._ Later the\r\nname _Whig_ was dropped, and the paper remains to this day the\r\n_Goshen Democrat._ The firm of Mead & Son came into existence January\r\n1, 1865, and continued until January 1, 1892, when the elder Mead\r\nsold his interest to Edwin L. Roys. William W. Mead and Edwin L.\r\nconducted the establishment under the firm name of Mead & Roys until\r\nSeptember 1, 1902, on which date they sold the concern to J. R.\r\nColburn, of Washington, D. C. Two months later (November 1, 1902),\r\nJohn F. Barringer, of Walden, bought the plant and, two months later\r\n(January 1, 1903), sold it to John B. Scott and George V. Gregg, who\r\nconducted the same under the firm name of Scott & Gregg, until\r\nSeptember 1, 1905. on which date Mr. Scott sold his interest to\r\nGeorge F. Gregg, who has since been its proprietor.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Williams & Farrand started the _Orange Farmer._ Mr. Ruttenber\r\nspeaks of this as the _Orange County Farmer,_ but as the copies now\r\nin existence bear the title _Orange Farmer,_ the writer is inclined\r\nto believe the word \"County\" is a slip of the usually very accurate\r\npen of Mr. Ruttenber. Its founders were graduates of the Albany\r\n_Plow-Boy,_ and aimed to make the _Farmer_ an agricultural\r\npublication. How long it lasted is not known. A well-preserved copy\r\nof this _Farmer_ is now in possession of Dr. James J. Mills, of Port\r\nJervis. It is volume IV, No. 195, dated November 17, 1823.\r\n\r\nAbout 1822 there moved into Goshen a lusty young pioneer, sixteen\r\nyears of age, under the patronymic of _The Independent Republican._\r\nThis stripling was born at Montgomery, May 6, 1806, and there\r\nchristened the _Orange County Republican._ Under the tutelage of\r\nLuther Pratt in 1812, in its sixth year, its name was changed to that\r\nof the _Independent Republican,_ and in 1818 James A. Cheevey became\r\nits sponsor, and removed it to Goshen about 1822. In 1832 the\r\n_Independent Republican_ plant was sold to Henry H. Van Dyck, who\r\nsold it in 1836 when he became State Senator, to Victor M. Drake,\r\nthen a young printer twenty-seven years of age, who had for some time\r\nbeen employed in the office, as apprentice and journeyman printer. In\r\n1841 Mr. Drake sold the establishment to Moses Swezey, who came to\r\nGoshen from Long Island in 1834 as a violinist and dancing master. He\r\nwas a fine penman, a good bookkeeper, and an excellent accountant,\r\nand became the head clerk for County Clerk Lebbeus L. Vail. As editor\r\nof the _Independent Republican_ he wielded a powerful and caustic\r\npen, and became a power in Orange County politics. He was the father\r\nof the present Surrogate, John B. Swezey.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Mr. Swezey sold the plant to Clark & Montanye. It continued,\r\nas it long had been, the local organ of the \"Hunker\" faction of the\r\nDemocracy. Late in the '50's Mr. Clark went to Iowa and started a\r\nRepublican paper. James J. McNally purchased the plant in 1853, and\r\nsold it to Isaac V. Montanye in 1857, only to repurchase it, selling\r\nit again in 1869 to Edward M. Ruttenber and H. P. Kimber. Mr.\r\nRuttenber retired, and in 1874 Mr. Kimber sold it to Thomas P.\r\nMcElrath, an ambitious New Yorker, who had some fond illusions which\r\nhe hoped to engraft into Orange County journalism. He made friends\r\nand foes fast and furious--particularly the foes--and in 1876 retired\r\nto New York, utterly disgusted with journalism in Orange County.\r\n\r\nThen Hon. I. V. Montanye and his son, Lucien, secured the paper. In\r\n1883 the former retired, and Frank Drake secured an interest in the\r\nconcern, under the firm name of Montanye & Drake. In March, 1892, Mr.\r\nDrake became sole owner, and remains such to-day (March, 1908).\r\n\r\nThe present proprietor of the _Independent Republican,_ Frank Drake,\r\nis a son of that veteran Orange County journalist, Victor M. Drake,\r\nand is a \"chip of the old block,\" a good newspaper man. He is making\r\nthe paper newsy, keen, merry and bright. He changed it from a weekly\r\nto a semi-weekly edition, issued on Tuesdays and Fridays. It is a\r\nfive-column quarto.\r\n\r\nThe _Independent Republican_ has not always had things its own way in\r\nGoshen Democratic politics. In 1843 Hector Vail, son of County Clerk\r\nLebbeus L. Vail, and T. W. Donovan started the _Democratic Standard_\r\nunder the firm name of Vail & Donovan. The _Standard_ represented the\r\n\"Barn-Burners\" or Free Soil element in the Democratic party, and in\r\nantagonism to the interests represented the \"Hunkers\" and the\r\n_Independent Republican._ In 1844 Mr. Donovan retired, and Hector\r\nVail changed its name to the _Goshen Clarion._ The Democratic\r\nfactional fight became stronger, and the _Clarion_ had such backers\r\nas Lebbeus L. Vail, Asa D. Jansen, James H. Jansen, John B. Booth of\r\nGoshen; Merritt H. Cash, Minisink, and Francis Tuthill of Chester. On\r\nthe death of Lebbeus Vail, the _Clarion,_ in 1879 was discontinued,\r\nthe subscription list going to the _Independent Republican_ and the\r\nmaterial to Milford, Pa., having been purchased by John M. Heller or\r\nJames J. McNally, or both, and where it became the _Pike County\r\nDemocrat_ and later the _Milford Herald._\r\n\r\nOne paper devoted exclusively to theological subjects had its origin\r\nin Goshen, and lives to-day to tell the tale. In 1832 the _Signs of\r\nthe Times_ was started, by Lebbeus L. Vail, a convert from\r\nCongregationalism to the Old School Baptist tenets. Between politics\r\nand theology Mr. Vail was kept pretty busy. He was a candidate for\r\ncounty clerk on the Democratic ticket, and in 1834 was elected. About\r\nthis time an earnest young expounder of Mr. Vail's new-grounded faith\r\nappeared on the scene. Mr. Vail could not very well run a religious\r\njournal and the county clerk's office at the same time, so he turned\r\nthe _Signs of the Times_ over, body and soul, to the youthful\r\npreacher, and Elder Gilbert Beebe took his prize in a wagon, and\r\nlanded it in New Vernon, near Middletown. Thence he moved it to\r\nAlexandria, Va., whence it came to Middletown, where it is domiciled\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nDuring the fight in the Democratic party between the \"Hard-Shell\"\r\nfaction, representing the pro-slavery element, and the \"Soft-Shell,\"\r\nrepresenting the Douglas, Squatter-Sovereignty, or Anti-Nebraska\r\nelement in the party, in 1854, the _Democratic Recorder_ was started\r\nby A. G. Tucker. The _Recorder_ had a short life, and the\r\nsubscription list and materials were purchased by James J. McNally\r\nand absorbed by his _Independent Republican._\r\n\r\nThe next and last paper to appear in Goshen was the _Goshen News,_ in\r\n1888, under James J. McNally, which, as already told, passed into\r\nthat ever-open haven of refuge, the portals of the _Independent\r\nRepublican,_ on the death of Mr. McNally, in 1892.\r\n\r\n                    NEWBURGH AND NEW WINDSOR.\r\n\r\nWhen New Windsor leaps into the arena of contest with a journal of\r\nuncertain antiquity, but clearly at the daybreak of journalistic\r\nchronology in Orange County, she has grounds for contesting the\r\nconcession that Newburgh was second, or Goshen even first, in the\r\nhonors due to pioneerism in the printing art.\r\n\r\nE. M. Ruttenber says: \"In 1799 Jacob Schultz removed to Newburgh the\r\n_New Windsor Gazette,_ the name of which he changed to _Orange County\r\nGazette._\" It is not in evidence when this New Windsor paper began\r\nand it may have been immediately or long prior to its removal to\r\nNewburgh.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Ruttenber says the first paper published in Newburgh was the\r\n_Newburgh Packet_ in 1795. The proprietor was Lucius Carey,\r\nson-in-law of Rev. John Close, Presbyterian minister at Newburgh and\r\nNew Windsor. Carey sold the paper to David Denniston in 1797, who\r\nchanged its name to _The Mirror,_ Philip Van Home (1797) and Joseph\r\nW. Barber (1798) appearing as proprietors.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 a pamphlet entitled, \"An Apology for the Bible,\" was printed\r\nin Newburgh, by David Denniston. It was written by R. Watson, D.D.,\r\nF.R.S. It is said it was creditably printed and bound.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Orange County Gazette_ emerged from the _New Windsor\r\nGazette_ in 1799, Newburgh had two printing shops where books as well\r\nas papers were printed, and the legend is that the _Gazette_ became\r\n_The Citizen,_ though Mr. Ruttenber questions this, as none of the\r\nissues are to be found. As Mr. Denniston was, about this time,\r\nconnected with the _American Citizen,_ of New York City, this fact\r\nmay have given rise to the belief that a local _Citizen_ had existed.\r\n\r\n_The Rights of Man_ was started in 1799 by Dr. Elias Winfield. Mr.\r\nDenniston also purchased this paper, evidently merging it with his\r\n_Orange County Gazette._\r\n\r\n_The Recorder of the Times_ was started by Dennis Cole, in 1803. _The\r\nMirror_ was absorbed by the _Rights of Man_ in 1804, and the latter\r\nby _The Times,_ in 1805. Ward M. Gazlay, this year, drove into town\r\nwith the remnants of his _Orange Eagle,_ whose office had been burned\r\nin Goshen, purchased the _Recorder of the Times,_ in 1806, and\r\nchanged the name to the _Political Index,_ and it lived until 1829,\r\nwhen it became the _Orange Telegraph_ and the _Newburgh Telegraph_\r\nunder Charles M. Cushman. Under many changes it lived to become,\r\nunder E. M. Ruttenber, in 1876, the _Newburgh Register._\r\n\r\nIn June, 1822, John D. Spaulding started the _Newburgh Gazette._\r\nThrough a succession of owners it came, in 1856, to Eugene W. Gray,\r\nwho, in connection with the _Gazette,_ began the publication of a\r\npolitical paper which he called the _Daily News._ In 1864 the name of\r\nthe _News_ was dropped and _Daily Telegraph_ substituted, and later\r\nin the same year it became the _Daily Union,_ in 1866 all the\r\nprevious titles were dropped and that of _The Press_ substituted, in\r\n1869 the title of _Telegraph_ restored, and in 1876 that of\r\n_Register._\r\n\r\nThe _Newburgh Journal,_ started in 1833-4 by John D. Spaulding,\r\nbecame the _Highland Courier_ in 1843, and in 1859, under Rufus A.\r\nReed, it became the _Highland Chieftain._ The establishment came into\r\nthe possession of Cyrus B. Martin, who resumed the name of _Newburgh\r\nJournal,_ and in 1863 began the publication of the _Daily Journal,_\r\nwhich is continued to-day by Ritchie & Hull.\r\n\r\n_The Beacon,_ an anti-Jackson paper, was commenced in 1828 by Judge\r\nWilliam B. Wright. Wallace & Sweet, in 1834, published the _National\r\nAdvertiser,_ and later merged it in the _Gazette._ In 1849 Thomas\r\nGeorge issued the _Newburgh Excelsior,_ which was purchased by E. M.\r\nRuttenber (May, 1851), who merged it in the _Telegraph._ For three or\r\nfour weeks in 1855 R. P. L. Shafer published the _Newburgh American._\r\n_The Newburgh Times,_ a temperance paper, was started in March, 1856,\r\nby Royal B. Hancock, \"as agent for an association of gentlemen.\"\r\nAfter passing into the ownership of R. Bloomer & Son, Alexander\r\nWilson and Charles Blanchard, it became, under the latter, the\r\n_Newburgh Daily Democrat,_ and lived thus only a few months.\r\n\r\nAn association of printers, in October, 1875, started the _Daily\r\nPenny Post,_ and in 1876 a rival association started the _Daily\r\nMail._ The _Post_ died in 1876, and in 1877 the _Mail_ was absorbed\r\nby the _Register._\r\n\r\nNewburgh's theological serial publications began in 1824, when the\r\nRev. J. R. Wilson started the _Evangelical Witness,_ a religious\r\nmonthly of forty-eight pages, devoted to the interests of the\r\nReformed Presbyterian church. In four years (1828), it was succeeded\r\nby the _Christian Statesman,_ which lived one year. Authorized by\r\nthe Synod of the same church, the Rev. Moses Roney, March 1, 1836,\r\nbegan the publication of the _Reformed Presbyterian,_ a monthly of\r\nthirty-two pages. In 1849 Mr. Roney removed the magazine to\r\nPittsburgh, Pa., where he died in 1854, and his widow continued its\r\npublication until succeeded by the Rev. Thomas Sproul. For one year\r\nthe _Family Visitor_ lived, a monthly quarto, conducted by the Rev.\r\nDavid L. Proudfit. Beginning in 1845 he published the _Christian\r\nInstructor,_ a thirty-two page monthly. Two years later the Rev.\r\nJ. B. Dales bought it and removed it to Philadelphia. The _Catholic\r\nLibrary Magazine_ was begun in 1856 by the Catholic Library\r\nAssociation, with John Ashhurst as editor. It was published monthly,\r\nand lived until August, 1860.\r\n\r\nNewburgh has been a fertile field for the production of newspapers\r\nand periodicals of all sorts, as seen above, the religious as well as\r\nthe secular press felt the popular pulse, and then passed away.\r\n\r\nThere were also literary ventures more or less pretentious, each\r\nbudding, blossoming and fading in a short season.\r\n\r\n_Tables of Rural Economy_ was issued in May, 1832, by John Knevels.\r\nIt was a monthly quarto and lived less than a year. The _Literary\r\nScrap-Book_ was a monthly of forty-eight pages, started in 1855 by\r\nR. B. Denton. Its life was short. In 1857 Domaski's School began the\r\npublication of _The Acorn,_ which lived until 1859. Some time\r\nafterward the title was rescued in a publication by the students of\r\nthe Newburgh Institute under charge of Mr. Siglar, and again it died.\r\n\r\nOne of the most profitable of all these literary ventures in Newburgh\r\nwas that of the _Household Advocate,_ by S. S. Wood, begun in 1867.\r\nIt was an eight-page monthly and soon secured a large circulation.\r\nMr. Wood later changed its name to the _Household Magazine._ It\r\nattained a circulation of 60,000, and the writer is one of the many\r\nwho read its pages with eagerness until it failed in 1874.\r\n\r\nAnother publication which the writer remembers reading with much\r\npleasure was _Home, Farm and Orchard,_ an eight-page weekly started\r\nin 1869 by A. A. Bensel. It lived until the spring of 1876.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of 1872 and 1873 Demorest & Burr issued the _Musical\r\nBulletin,_ a monthly quarto.\r\n\r\nIn amateur papers there were several. Among them: _The Union Jack,_\r\nby Master A. Ludlow Case (1865 to 1873); the _American Eagle,_ by\r\nFrank S. Hull, aged twelve years (1865); _The Comet,_ by Henri Gerard\r\n(1871); _The Index,_ by J. Walker F. Ruttenber (1871); _The\r\nCollector,_ by D. W. Jagger (1871); _The Packet,_ by W. H. Wood and\r\nD. W. Corwin (1872); _The Laurel,_ by a Milligan (1872); the _Amateur\r\nHerald,_ by T. R. Balf (1872).\r\n\r\n                            AT MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\nMontgomery seems to have come forth into the journalistic arena.\r\n\r\nThe _Orange County Republican_ was printed there from 1806 to 1818.\r\nIt was begun May 6, 1806, and was printed by Cyrus Beach and Luther\r\nPratt. This publication, as already shown in the Goshen notes, was\r\nremoved to Goshen and became the _Independent Republican._\r\n\r\nIn 1833-1834 the _Republican Banner_ was printed there by Calvin\r\nF. S. Thomas. In June, 1859, William H. Smith started the _Montgomery\r\nStandard._ The _Montgomery Republican_ was issued in September, 1868,\r\nby Lester Winfield, being a continuation of a publication he started\r\nat Galeville Mills, Ulster County, in May, 1864, and which he removed\r\nto Pine Bush and called the _Pine Bush Weekly Casket,_ in November,\r\n1867. May 1, 1869, the _Standard_ and the _Republican_ united their\r\nforces and became the _Republican and Standard,_ under Lester\r\nWinfield. In 1896 Lyman H. Taft started the _Reporter._ Later the\r\n_Reporter_ and the _Republican and Standard_ united, and became the\r\n_Montgomery Standard and Reporter,_ which it is now (March, 1908),\r\nwith Lyman H. Taft as editor and proprietor, and Charles M. Miller,\r\nassociate editor. It is a large nine-column folio, republican in\r\npolitics, with a decided tendency to be independent.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1868, Stephen H. Sayer started the _Wallkill Valley Times,_\r\na large seven-column folio. It was neatly printed, and the office\r\nwell-equipped, with a cylinder press--a rare acquisition in those\r\ndays. In 1869 Mr. Sayer issued the _Dollar Weekly._ In 1871 Lester\r\nWinfield purchased the _Times_ and the _Weekly_ outfit, and remained\r\nin Montgomery until his death a few years ago.\r\n\r\n                           AT SLATE HILL.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to a well-printed paper issued in\r\nSlate Hill or Brookfield, in 1834, the _Republican Sentinel._ The\r\nwriter has several well-preserved copies of this neat publication,\r\nbut when it passed out of existence is not now known. The name of the\r\neditor does not appear, nor of the publisher.\r\n\r\nSlate Hill in that day was a thriving settlement, and doubtless would\r\nhave continued to grow had not the Erie railroad come to Goshen in\r\n1842 and to Middletown two or three years later.\r\n\r\n                             IN MIDDLETOWN.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1840 that the first printing outfit landed in Middletown.\r\nIn that year A. A. Bensel started the _Middletown Courier,_ a\r\ndemocratic weekly, which he continued until April, 1846, when,\r\napparently scared by the entrance of the Erie railroad, he \"pulled up\r\nstakes\" and never stopped until his outfit was landed in Kingston,\r\nN. Y., where he started the _Ulster Democrat._\r\n\r\nThe _Orange County News_ was the second venture in Middletown. This\r\nwas started in July, 1846, by John S. Brown, and it lived until 1849.\r\nIt was neutral in politics and evidently in almost everything else,\r\nand, it is said, hardly deserved the name of a newspaper.\r\n\r\nAbout 1847 Elder Gilbert Beebe came into town with his Old School\r\nBaptist _Signs of the Times,_ which he removed from Alexandria, Va.,\r\nas already explained. This publication continues, changed somewhat in\r\nform but not in method or substance, and remains a monument to the\r\npeculiar tenets of the faithful band of adherents of a sturdy\r\ntheological doctrine. For many years it was printed in the \"meeting\r\nhouse\" on Orchard street, where the Denton residence now stands, and\r\ndirectly opposite the residence of Elder Beebe. A few years ago, and\r\nsome time after the death of Elder Beebe, the plant was removed to\r\nthe upper floor of the brick building at the west corner of East Main\r\nand Roberts streets, and the \"meeting-house,\" a plain brick\r\nstructure, stands on the corner of Roberts and Cottage streets. The\r\n_Signs_ is published by J. E. Beebe & Co., and is edited by Elder\r\nF. A. Chick, of Hopewell, N. J., and Elder H. C. Kerr, of Middletown.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Gilbert Judson Beebe started the _Banner of Liberty._ It was\r\nat first published monthly, eight pages with four columns to a page.\r\nAfter 1856 it became a weekly publication, the same size. It was a\r\nrank pro-slavery paper, and opposed and assaulted all lines of modern\r\nthought or suggestion of innovation or iconoclasm. This style of\r\npolemics met a hearty response in the South and Southwest, and the\r\npaper attained a circulation of 27,000 copies. For years it was\r\nprinted in the old frame structure then known as the Pinkus Building\r\non East Main street, next to the Holding House. When the Civil War\r\nbroke out its circulation and income were greatly cut down by the\r\ninterruption of mail communication between the North and the South,\r\nand the death of the talented but obdurate and intractable editor,\r\nafter the war, left nothing for the _Banner of Liberty_ to do but to\r\ngo somewhere and expire. It did. It went to Ellenville, and shortly\r\nwas heard of no more.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Mr. Beebe published a _Campaign Banner._\r\n\r\nGilbert J. Beebe also started in 1848, and in this case may fairly be\r\nsaid to have \"established\" the _Middletown Mercury_ which as\r\nelsewhere stated, became one of the brightest country newspapers in\r\nthe United States under James H. Norton and Isaac F. Guiwits.\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe printed another paper in his early and more ambitious days.\r\nFrom 1850 to 1852 he ran out an advertising monthly for gratuitous\r\ncirculation. It was called the _Middletown Advertiser._\r\n\r\nThe next paper to appear in Middletown was _The Whig Press._ It was\r\nstarted November 26, 1851, by John Whitbeck Hasbrouck, a young man\r\nfrom Ulster County. In 1866 he changed its name to the _Orange County\r\nPress._ This concern, always prosperous and influential, but which\r\nfinally merged with the _Times_ and became a part of the\r\n_Times-Press_ (February 1, 1906), had an eventful career, which is\r\nbest summed up in the following brevities taken from the last issue\r\nof the _Daily Press,_ February 28, 1906:\r\n\r\nEstablished November 26, 1851, by John W. Hasbrouck, and conducted by\r\nhim for about seventeen years.\r\n\r\nApril 9, 1868, purchased by Moses D. Stivers and conducted by him\r\nfor twenty months.\r\n\r\nDecember 3, 1869, firm of Stivers & Kessinger formed, the junior\r\nmember being Albert Kessinger, who died in the summer of 1872.\r\n\r\nMay 24, 1870, a tri-weekly edition was started, issued Tuesdays,\r\nThursdays and Saturdays.\r\n\r\nOctober 15, 1872, F. Stanhope Hill and John Whiting Slauson bought\r\nthe paper under the firm name of Hill & Slauson.\r\n\r\nOctober 26, 1872. this firm discontinued the tri-weekly known as the\r\n_Evening Press,_ and started in its place the _Middletown Daily\r\nPress,_ issued afternoons.\r\n\r\nJuly 1, 1873, M. D. Stivers bought Mr. Hill's interest, and the firm\r\nof Stivers & Slauson was formed and continued seven and one-half\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nDecember 14, 1880, Mr. Stivers sold his interest to Charles J. Boyd,\r\nand the firm of Slauson & Boyd was formed.\r\n\r\nJuly 24, 1883, Slauson & Boyd issued the first number of the _Orange\r\nCounty Semi-Weekly Press_--the first semi-weekly local paper in this\r\nsection, and a pronounced success from the start.\r\n\r\nAugust 1, 1883, M. D. Stivers again became part owner of the _Press,_\r\nand the firm became Stivers, Slauson & Boyd, continuing for about\r\nseven and one-half years.\r\n\r\nMarch 1, 1891, Mr. Stivers sold his interest to his partners, and the\r\nfirm of Slauson & Boyd for the second time came into existence.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1, 1906, merged into the _Times-Press,_ after an honored and\r\nprosperous record of more than fifty-four years.\r\n\r\nThe term of service with the _Press_ of each proprietor in round\r\nnumbers is: John W. Hasbrouck, seventeen years; Moses D. Stivers,\r\nnineteen years; John W. Slauson, thirty-three years; Charles J.\r\nBoyd, twenty-five years; Albert Kessinger, three years; F. Stanhope\r\nHill, one year.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to _The Hardwareman's Newspaper_\r\n(1855), _The Sybil_ (1856), _The Iron Age_ (1858), _The Rising Sun_\r\n(1866), _The Mail,_ daily and weekly (1869), _The Standard_ (1874?),\r\n_The Argus,_ weekly (1875), daily (1876), _The Liberal Sentinel_\r\n(1881), _The News_ (1883), _The Jeffersonian_ (1886?), _The Forum_\r\n(1897), and the _Worker's Advocate_ (1899?).\r\n\r\n                       THE PRESS IN PORT JERVIS.\r\n\r\nPrinting was introduced into Port Jervis by a colored man, P. H.\r\nMiller. Of his personality the writer is unable, at this day, to\r\nlearn a thing--whence he came or whither he departed. He began the\r\nprinting here of an independent Whig paper, which he called the _Port\r\nJervis Express,_ early in 1850. It was neatly printed, a five or\r\nsix-column folio, and reflected credit on its founder. It was printed\r\nin an office on West Main street, on the west side of the canal. That\r\nsection was then about all there was of Port Jervis, though the Erie\r\nhad arrived, and started a station near the Delaware River which it\r\ncalled Delaware. The people of \"the Port\" objected to this name, and\r\nfor a long time strife was keen between the residents and the Erie\r\ncompany over the name, the advocates of \"the Port\" finally winning.\r\n\r\nThe _Express_ saw the tail end of this fight, before its life of nine\r\nmonths drew to a close.\r\n\r\nIn November of the year (1850) when the Express passed away, the\r\n_Tri-States Union_ was started. Its founder was Col. Sam Fowler, a\r\nJersey-man who had acquired considerable land in the village, all\r\nwithin the boundaries of the present city. He was ambitious, had\r\nmoney, vim and a purpose. He built a palatial home on the banks of\r\nthe Neversink, erected the Fowler House, and was proceeding to make\r\nPort Jervis the booming town of the east, when financial disaster\r\novertook him, and, to the great loss of the town, he left it never to\r\nreturn, his vast interests involved in hopeless encumbrances.\r\n\r\nBut before he left he started the _Tri-States Union,_ and it lives\r\nto-day. It was a Democratic newspaper, with John I. Mumford editor.\r\n_The Union_ has had a number of owners, and had its ups and downs,\r\nbut it always managed to appear on schedule time, and in usual form,\r\nthough at times during the Civil War it was sorely pressed to\r\nimitate many of its exchanges--when it was almost impossible to buy,\r\nbeg or steal white paper--and appear in wrapping paper, or in \"any\r\nold thing.\" It is now a six-column quarto, with a large circulation,\r\nhas an afternoon edition of the _Port Jervis Daily Union,_\r\nseven-column folio, has two of the latest Mergenthaler Linotype\r\nmachines, and is of the concern that issues one of the leading\r\nagricultural papers of the country, _The New York Farmer._\r\n\r\nThe _Tri-States Union_ was first issued in a small building somewhere\r\nnear where the Hubbard Building now stands, opposite the Fowler House\r\nand the present Erie depot (1908). Later it was removed to the old\r\nframe building Nos. 55-57 Pike street, now the four-story brick\r\nstructure built by George Lea and occupied by Mason & Son, druggists.\r\nThe early 60's found it located on Pike street, over the Union store,\r\nin the second floor of the two-story frame structure at No. 100 Pike\r\nstreet now (March, 1908) occupied as the Central or Northrup's meat\r\nmarket. Thence it was removed by Foster & Mitchell (1870) to the\r\nCreegan Block, No. 76 Pike street, over what is now Laidley's drug\r\nstore. Next (1872) it was removed to the rear of St. John & Malven's,\r\nnow the Gordon Company foundry building, on Sussex street. In 1873\r\nit was removed to No. 81 Pike street, now Collin's news and\r\nconfectionery store, and in 1882 to its present location No. 112\r\nPike street, in the Farnum Block.\r\n\r\nPort Jervis has survived many severe temperance agitations. The most\r\nacute stage seems to have been in the extreme youth of the\r\nplace--when impressions ought to be most lasting and beneficial.\r\nBetween 1852 and 1855, it had three papers devoted to the cause of\r\ntemperance. The first was the _Mirror of Temperance_ started in June,\r\n1852, by J. L. Barlow and John Dow. This _Mirror_ reflected its\r\nsurroundings for about eighteen months, and then faded away. It was a\r\nhandsome paper, well printed and ably edited.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 an Englishman, John Williams, took up the fight where the\r\n_Mirror_ dropped it, and started _The Sentinel._ With the proverbial\r\npugnacity of a \"Johnny Bull,\" Mr. Williams thought he needed more\r\npaper weapons with which to fight the \"drink evil,\" and so, in the\r\nautumn of 1854 he issued a campaign paper which he called _The\r\nPrecursor of Temperance,_ and which died with the fall campaign. _The\r\nSentinel_ lived until 1855, in which year Mr. Williams went to\r\nMiddletown and in the _Whig Press_ office began issuing the\r\n_Hardwareman's Newspaper,_ the precursor of the _Iron Age,_ the\r\nleading organ to-day of the iron industry in this country, and which\r\nis now---or was recently--published by his son, David Williams, in\r\nNew York City.\r\n\r\nApril 22, 1869, James Henry Norton and William Henry Nearpass began\r\nthe publication of the _Evening Gazette._ It was a five-column folio,\r\nset in bourgeois type, was published tri-weekly, Tuesdays,\r\nThursdays and Saturdays. Soon afterward appeared the weekly edition,\r\n_The Family Gazette,_ afterward changed to _The Port Jervis Weekly\r\nGazette._ It was started on the third floor of the brick building\r\nthen just built by Cook & Burrell as an umbrella factory at No. 92\r\nPike street, now (March, 1908), occupied by Johnson & Stoll's\r\nfurniture store. Thence it moved to Westbrook's Hall, the third floor\r\nof the building now occupied by the J. W. Dalley Co., Nos. 66-68 Pike\r\nstreet; thence to its present quarters in the Mondon Building, 90\r\nPike street, corner of Pike and Ball streets. The tri-weekly became a\r\ndaily afternoon issue, January 17, 1881. It is now a well-equipped\r\noffice, has a Mergenthaler Linotype machine, and all the accessories\r\nof a good country newspaper.\r\n\r\nE. G. Fowler's _Morning Call_ appeared on Sunday morning, April 4,\r\n1880. It was printed in the Masterson Building, No. 10 Ball street.\r\nThe _Morning Index_ appeared in an upper floor of the Hornbeck\r\nBuilding, now the Swift Beef House on Jersey avenue. The _Sunbeams_\r\nand _Farm Guide_ were issued from _The Union_ office, and _Church\r\nLife_ and _Academy Miscellany_ from _The Gazette_ office. _The\r\nBulletin_ is the name of a two-column folio that is issued\r\noccasionally in political and exciting local campaigns, from the\r\npress of printer P. J. Gaudy, on Ball street. It doesn't appear very\r\noften, but when it does it makes a sensation.\r\n\r\n                           AT WARWICK.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful village of Warwick, the \"Queen Village\" of New York\r\nState, has two well-established, ably-edited, well-printed and\r\ninfluential weekly newspapers, reflecting with no exaggeration the\r\nsentiment and conditions of the Warwick valley--a land rich in\r\nnature's bounties, lavishly endowed with all the charms of rural\r\nromanticism and pastoral fervency.\r\n\r\nThe first paper published in Warwick, so far as present records are\r\nobtainable, was the _Doctrinal Advocate and Monitor._ It was probably\r\nstarted as early as 1845--possibly earlier--and was edited or\r\nconducted by Elder Jewett as an exponent of the Old School Baptist\r\ndoctrine. In 1846 this _Monitor_ was merged with Elder Gilbert\r\nBeebe's _Signs of the Times,_ and for a while the latter paper was\r\npublished under both titles.\r\n\r\nThe second paper started there was the _Warwick Advertiser,_ the\r\nfirst number of which made its appearance January 27, 1866. It was a\r\nwell-printed, neat, newsy, and bright paper from the first, and age\r\nnot only does not dim its luster, but seems to add to its\r\nsprightliness. Its first editor and proprietor was Leonard Cox, who\r\nwas an elder in the Old School Baptist church of Warwick for a few\r\nyears. It was independent, or rather neutral, in politics, but\r\ncatered to the religious and moral sentiment as well as the local\r\ninterests of the community, from its inception, and has never ceased\r\nto act as a propagandist theological, political, social and formal.\r\nWithin three years Elder Cox sold the plant to John L. Servin, a\r\nlocal lawyer and farmer, a man of high standing and education. In\r\n1873 Mr. Servin transferred the business to his associate editor,\r\nDaniel F. Welling, a practical printer, but took back the concern\r\nwithin the year and soon afterward sold the same to Samuel J.\r\nStewart and Joshua C. Wilson. A few years later Mr. Wilson sold his\r\ninterest to Dewitt C. Demorest, a workman in the office, who, after\r\na year or two, transferred his share back to Mr. Stewart, who\r\nremained sole proprietor until April 1, 1882, when the plant was\r\npurchased by its present owner and able editor, Hiram Tate. Under Mr.\r\nTate's management the _Advertiser_ became an advocate of the\r\npolitics of the republican party, of which it has since remained a\r\nstaunch and fearless supporter. The _Advertiser_ has been a factor of\r\nno little importance in the growth and general well-being of the\r\nvillage and Warwick valley. After a careful campaign of education on\r\nthat special subject, it was largely instrumental in bringing about\r\nthe now very popular and certainly sensible style of fenceless\r\ndooryards and lawns, so prevalent in Warwick as to excite the\r\nadmiration of all tasteful visitors, and one of the distinguishing\r\nfactors in earning for the place the well-merited title of the\r\n\"Queen Village.\" It was also largely through the efforts of the\r\n_Advertiser_ that a teacher in music and elocution has been added to\r\nthe Warwick schools. Other betterments in local affairs have been\r\nbrought about by this paper's efforts, and the _Advertiser_ is\r\ncertainly a paper of high tone and a credit to the Warwick valley.\r\n\r\nThe third newspaper to make its appearance in Warwick was the\r\n_Warwick Valley Dispatch,_ which has been a success from its start.\r\nIt was established in June, 1885, by George F. Ketchum, who has since\r\nbeen its fearless editor and publisher. The _Dispatch_ has prospered\r\nunder Mr. Ketchum's continuous and wise management of nearly\r\ntwenty-three years, and has been a potent factor in shaping the\r\nprogressive development of the village and town of Warwick. Its\r\ncolumns have been especially devoted to school improvement, the\r\n_Dispatch_ and its editor taking a leading part in the movement for\r\ntwo modern brick school houses--primary and high school--during the\r\ntwelve years that Mr. Ketchum served as a member of the Warwick board\r\nof education, he being president of the board when the high school\r\nwas built. It is generally acknowledged that the successful outcome\r\nof this agitation was largely due to the influence of the _Dispatch_\r\nand its editor. The paper has been a leader in all efforts to secure\r\nimprovements for the village and the valley, especially for increased\r\nwater supply, fine streets, and roads, and the development of Warwick\r\nas a summer resort. The paper also heartily advanced the formation of\r\nthe Warwick Valley Telephone Company, the Warwick Realty Company and\r\nthe Warwick Knife Company. Politically the Dispatch is democratic,\r\nand is recognized as the most influential exponent of democracy in\r\nthis section of the State. For a dozen years its editor has been\r\nchairman of the democratic county committee, during which time the\r\ninfluence of the Dispatch has been markedly shown in shaping the\r\npolicy of the party in Orange County, and in the favorable results\r\nachieved for its candidates at the polls, although the county has a\r\nnormal republican majority. The paper has gained a large local\r\ncirculation because of its newsy features, and is respected for its\r\nfairness and fearlessness in controversy. The Dispatch was started\r\nas a nine-column four-page newspaper, and was first printed in a\r\nsmall frame building on Main street, adjoining the Warwick Valley\r\nHotel. Since 1889 it has been comfortably housed in a brick structure\r\nknown as \"The Dispatch Building,\" which was erected on Main street by\r\nThomas Burd, and is equipped with modern presses and a Simplex\r\ntypesetting machine. Although Mr. Ketchum has always personally\r\ncontrolled the editorial policy of the Dispatch, Isaac W. Litchfield\r\nwas a partner with him in its business from 1889 to 1894, and much of\r\nthe reputation of the _Dispatch_ is due to his bright humor and\r\nfacile pen.\r\n\r\n                          CORNWALL PAPERS.\r\n\r\nCornwall, or rather Cornwall-on-Hudson, has had its full share of\r\njournalistic ups and downs. Through the courtesy of L. G. Goodenough,\r\neditor and proprietor of the _Local-Press_ of that place, the writer\r\nlearns that the first paper, probably, issued in that interesting old\r\ntown appeared April 15, 1871. It was called _The Cornwall Paper:_ \"A\r\nLocal Record of Things New and Old.\" It was published by P. P. Hazen,\r\nof Cornwall, in conjunction with A. A. Bensel, Ferry Building,\r\nNewburgh. It was stipulated, in the editorial announcement, that\r\nunless the necessary support in the way of subscriptions, etc., was\r\nreceived, the project would have to be abandoned. Mr. Goodenough has\r\na copy of Volume 1, No. 1, of _The Cornwall Paper,_ and as no other\r\nnumber seems to be in existence, it is assumed the requisite\r\n\"support\" never materialized, and that the paper practically \"died\r\naborning.\"\r\n\r\nTo a woman belongs the credit of having started the first regularly\r\nissued paper in this village. _The Cornwall Times_ appeared May 24,\r\n1875, with Miss S. J. A. Hussey, a highly educated woman, as editor\r\nand proprietor. The _Times_ was continued for at least six years, and\r\nwith credit to herself and to Cornwall. Miss Hussey died February 21,\r\n1898, aged seventy-nine years. Her declining days were passed\r\npractically as a recluse in a cabin on Round Top Mountain, which she\r\nowned, and where she seemed to be happiest, efforts of relatives to\r\npersuade her to live with them proving unavailing.\r\n\r\nThe _Cornwall Reflector_ was started about 1877 by John Lee, and\r\nlater was edited by H. H. Snelling, an elderly gentleman of ability\r\nand a forceful writer. He continued as editor for ten years, and\r\nuntil failing eyesight forced him to retire, and he went to a St.\r\nLouis home for the blind, where he died in the early nineties, after\r\nhaving become totally blind.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 appeared the _Cornwall Mirror._ It was published at Highland\r\nFalls by James C. Merritt, and was represented in Cornwall by various\r\npersons at different times.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1888, the _Cornwall Local_ appeared, under the management\r\nof H. A. Gates, and was an excellent paper. In September, 1889, he\r\ndisposed of the _Local_ plant to C. P. Brate, of Albany, who induced\r\nhis brother-in-law, Thomas Pendell, to become its editor and\r\npublisher. In June, 1892, the paper came under the present efficient\r\nmanagement of L. G. Goodenough. Mr. Pendell became connected with the\r\nNew York _Herald,_ later with the Middletown _Sunday Forum,_ which he\r\nremoved to Massena, N. Y., whence he went to Peekskill and then to\r\nPoughkeepsie. For the past fifteen years the _Local_ has been\r\nconducted by L. G. Goodenough, and is a particularly handsome, bright\r\nand ably-edited local journal. Practically the paper's former\r\npolitics was classed as \"independent.\" In 1896 Mr. Goodenough made it\r\ndistinctly and avowedly republican, and, as such, it has become an\r\ninfluential member of the county's republican press. In 1859 Mr.\r\nGoodenough purchased Mr. Merritt's _Cornwall Mirror,_ merging it with\r\nthe _Local._ Recently the name _Local-Press_ was adopted as more\r\nsignificant of a newspaper than the name _Local._ The _Local-Press_\r\nis an eight-page weekly, issued Thursdays at $1.50 a year, and with\r\nan average circulation for the year 1907 of 1,225 copies.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1898, S. T. Morehouse started a paper known as the\r\n_Cornwall Courier._ It was conducted by Mr. Morehouse, by his son\r\nClaude, by the well-known writer Creswell MacLaughlin, Bernard Call,\r\nClark J. Brown, Clayton Brown, and William Clark. It lived until\r\n1906.\r\n\r\n                              WALDEN NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\nWalden has two good, newsy weekly papers. So far as the writer can\r\nascertain the first paper started there was by Stephen H. Sayer, who,\r\nat Middletown, in 1866, started the _Rising Sun,_ and at Montgomery\r\nthe _Wallkill Valley Times_ (1868), and the _Dollar Weekly_ (1869).\r\nMr. Sayer started at Walden in 1869 the _Walden Recorder,_ but\r\nsuffered it to go down. In 1870 Chauncey B. Reed resumed its\r\npublication and called it the _Walden Recorder and Herald,_ but\r\nsubsequently dropped the _Recorder,_ and it has since appeared as the\r\n_Walden Herald._ It is now edited by Ward Winfield. It is a\r\nwell-printed seven-column folio, and devoted entirely to local and\r\ngeneral news.\r\n\r\nThe _Walden Citizen was_ established in 1887 by Jacob Sears, and had\r\nits first home over John Simpson's cigar store. The outfit consisted\r\nof a Washington hand press and a small quantity of type. After\r\nstruggling a year, the ownership passed into the hands of a Mr.\r\nScudder, and the plant was removed to the top floor of what is now\r\nthe Fowler building. Soon afterward Eugen Abel, a practical printer,\r\nand Prof. D. C. Dominick, principal of the high school, purchased the\r\nconcern, enlarged the paper and plant, and were getting the business\r\non a profitable basis when, in 1898, a fire swept everything away.\r\nThe paper was revived, however, and soon afterward Whitfield Gibbs\r\nbecame owner of the plant and speedily put the paper on solid footing\r\nand made it a leading republican paper. John Barringer succeeded Mr.\r\nGibbs, and since March, 1903, the Rev. J. H. Reid has been editor and\r\npublisher. The paper is republican in politics, and Mr. Reid makes it\r\na lively publication.\r\n\r\n                            MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that for two years (1884-1886) the _United\r\nStates Official Postal Guide_ for New York City was printed in Orange\r\nCounty. A. M. May & Co. had the contract and the printing was done by\r\nWilliam H. Nearpass at the _Port Jervis Gazette_ office.\r\n\r\nOf the papers at Pine Bush, Monroe, Washingtonville and Chester,\r\nmention has already been made.\r\n\r\nIn the number of publications Newburgh leads with about forty\r\npublications or changes from one to another; Middletown comes next\r\nwith 22, Port Jervis with 15, Goshen with 13, and Montgomery with 7.\r\n\r\nBloomingburg is in Sullivan County. So is New Vernon. But each is on\r\nthe south slope of the Shawangunk range and on the Shawangunk Kill,\r\nwhich divides the counties of Orange and Sullivan. In each place\r\nthere was once a paper that practically was an Orange County\r\nproduction, and depended to a greater or less extent on this county\r\nfor its support. The first was the _Signs of the Times_ in about\r\n1883. The other was the _Sullivan Whig_ at Bloomingburg, in 1846. The\r\nformer was Elder Beebe's Old School Baptist organ; the latter John W.\r\nHasbrouck found at Bloomingburg in 1846, where he began to learn the\r\nprinting trade.\r\n\r\n                           INCIDENTS.\r\n\r\nAs an auxiliary incident of Orange County journalism, it may not be\r\nentirely out of place to record some facts regarding journalism in\r\nPike County, Pa., opposite Port Jervis. In 1846 or 1847 James J.\r\nMcNally removed the material of the _Goshen Sentinel_ to Milford, in\r\nPike County, and started the _Pike County Democrat,_ July 14, 1849.\r\nIt was a seven-column folio. In 1852 he changed its name to the\r\n_Milford Herald._ Some time afterward John M. Heller purchased the\r\nplant, and put in charge John B. Adams and Harry Heller, the son of\r\nJ. M. Heller. It passed to several owners, and when O. H. Mott took\r\nit, in January 1, 1878, he for some unknown reason changed its name\r\nto the _Milford Dispatch,_ which it remains, and now, 1908, it is\r\nedited by Josiah F. Terwilliger.\r\n\r\nBut the first paper in Milford was _The Eagle of the North,_ in 1827,\r\nwith T. A. Wells, printer. In 1828 it became _The Northern Eagle and\r\nMilford Monitor,_ under Benjamin A. Bidwell. Somewhere between 1831\r\nand 1840 the paper disappeared. A second _Northern Eagle_ appeared\r\nFebruary 6, 1864, started by Dr. Edward Halliday. It was a red-hot\r\nrepublican journal, and, as might be inferred, had a small\r\nconstituency in that land of 991 democratic and only a few republican\r\nvoters, and it died January 1, 1866.\r\n\r\n                    MORE OR LESS PERSONAL.\r\n\r\nOrange County's pioneer journalists have been gathered to their\r\nfathers. Of the second generation there remains one--as if to link\r\nthe memories of the first with the fast-reclining activities of the\r\nthird generation of newspaper workers. And that one relic of the dead\r\npast is a woman, now in the sunset of life. Dr. Lydia Saver Hasbrouck\r\nis with us yet; a landmark in Orange County journalism--honored by\r\nthose who know her best, beloved by kindred, respected by all. The\r\ntwilight of her years is closing pleasantly at her beautiful home on\r\nLinden avenue, Middletown.\r\n\r\nOf the third generation but few remain of printers, reporters,\r\neditors, publishers. The frosts of many winters have silvered their\r\nheads, but the \"strength of years\" finds a few of them still\r\nstruggling with the insatiable demand of modern type-setting\r\nappliances for \"copy\" and the bustle and rush of daily newspaper\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is interesting to take a look at the individuals,\r\nthe characters--the men and women who have been on the scene of\r\naction, and who are there now. We have examined their work--the news\r\nand other papers and publications they have produced; we have scanned\r\nthem in the best light afforded, refracted and reflected, and to know\r\nsomewhat of those who, in their own and often crude way wrought these\r\npaper tablets of thought, let us again look over the field.\r\n\r\nMANDEVILLE AND WESTCOTT--The first names to appear--the first\r\ncharacters to attract our attention--are those of David Mandeville\r\nand David M. Westcott as publishers of the _Goshen Repository_\r\n(1788), \"at the Academy.\" What relations they had with the old\r\nGoshen Academy, or why the _Repository_ was started \"at the Academy\"\r\nis not apparent. Victor M. Drake wrote from his recollections that\r\nDavid M. Westcott \"was a practical printer and editor, who served a\r\nportion of his time in Benjamin Franklin's old printing office in\r\nPhiladelphia, though, of course, not under Franklin's mastership. He\r\nwas born in Cornwall of humble parentage, and in early life was\r\napprenticed to a farmer, and afterward learned the printer's trade.\r\nHis wife was the daughter of Coe Gale, one of the early settlers of\r\nGoshen, by whom he had five daughters and three sons, Mandeville,\r\nNathan, and William. Nathan was clerk of Orange County from 1844 to\r\n1855. David M. Prescott,\" continues Mr. Drake's recollections, \"was\r\nnot only a good practical printer, but a good merchant and farmer,\r\nan able editor, and a trustworthy public servant; he was county clerk\r\nin 1815 and 1821, member of assembly in 1828, state senator in\r\n1831-34, and filled many other stations of honor and trust. He acted\r\nas editor of the _Independent Republican_ for a long time after Mr.\r\nCheevey was struck down with paralysis. I have repeatedly called him\r\nfrom his labors on the farm to write editorials for the _Republican_,\"\r\nsays Mr. Drake, \"for such was the high state of party feeling that\r\nits public would trust no other man than 'little Dave Westcott' with\r\nthe responsibility of editing that paper in critical election times.\"\r\nSuch, then, was the character and standing of the first editor in\r\nOrange County. That he was a man whose character, whose personality,\r\nand whose extraordinary abilities stand clearly silhouetted against\r\nTime's somber background, is apparent to the reader and the student\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nCAREY, LUCIUS--The name of Lucius Carey appears next as the printer\r\nof the _Newburgh Packet_ in 1795. Beyond the announcement that he was\r\nthe son-in-law of the Rev. John Close, he cuts no illustrious figure.\r\n\r\nDENNISTON, DAVID--David Denniston appears on the scene in 1797 as\r\nthe purchaser of the _Packet_ from Carey, and as changing the name to\r\nthat of _The Mirror._ He was early in the field as a printer, having\r\na shop in Newburgh in 1796, when he got out a bound pamphlet or book\r\nfor the Rev. R. Watson, entitled \"An Apology for the Bible.\" Mr.\r\nRuttenber says he was of the New Windsor stock of Dennistons. Mr.\r\nDenniston was certainly a busy man, and a thinker. He died in\r\nNewburgh, December 13, 1803, of malignant fever, having up to that\r\ntime been connected, at different times, from 1796 or earlier, to\r\n1803, with the _American Citizen and Watch-Tower,_ of New York City,\r\nand _The Mirror, The Citizen,_ and the _Rights of Man,_ in Newburgh.\r\n\r\nSCHULTZ, JACOB--A local contemporary of Mr. Denniston was Jacob\r\nSchultz, also of New Windsor, where he was born April 23, 1776, and\r\nFebruary 14, 1799, married Anna, daughter of John Denniston, of that\r\ntown. He first appears in the journalistic field as editor and\r\nproprietor of the _New Windsor Gazette._ When this paper came into\r\nexistence is not known, though it was as early as, and probably some\r\ntime prior to, 1799, for in that year he moved the paper and plant to\r\nNewburgh. In 1818 he retired to a small farm in the town of New\r\nWindsor, where he erected a substantial stone house, and where, in\r\nrural pursuits and pleasures, he passed the remainder of his days,\r\nand was gathered to his fathers in 1859, aged eighty-three years.\r\n\r\nWINFIELD, DR. ELIAS--Next on the scene is Dr. Elias Winfield, who,\r\nin 1799, started the _Rights of Man,_ and later removed to Kingston,\r\nand was lost to subsequent Orange County history.\r\n\r\nHEURTIN, JOHN G. AND WILLIAM--John G. and William Heurtin are heard\r\nof in 1800 as purchasers of the _Goshen Repository,_ the name of\r\nwhich they changed to that of the _Orange County Patriot._ They seem\r\nto have retired from public view after 1803, when the _Patriot_\r\npassed into the hands of Gabriel Denton and William A. Carpenter, and\r\nbecame _The Friend of Truth._\r\n\r\nDENTON, GABRIEL--Gabriel Denton appears in 1801 as purchaser of the\r\ninterest of William Heurtin in the _Orange County Patriot._ In 1803\r\nMr. Denton sold his interest to William A. Carpenter. In 1804 Mr.\r\nDenton began the publication of the _Orange County Gazette_ at\r\nGoshen. In 1808 he started in Goshen the _Orange County Patriot and\r\nSpirit of Seventy-six._ Mr. Denton seems to have been industrious as\r\na founder of newspapers, but others must have reaped the reward, for\r\nhis last days were passed in the Orange County poorhouse.\r\n\r\nCOLES, DENNIS--The name of Dennis Coles appears in 1803 as starting\r\nthe _Recorder of the Times,_ in Newburgh.\r\n\r\nGAZLAY, WARD M--In 1804 Ward M. Gazlay appears on the scene for the\r\nfirst time. He was a native of Pennsylvania, and became engaged in\r\nthe printing business at Goshen as the purchaser of the _Friend of\r\nTruth,_ the successor of the _Repository_ and the _Patriot._ He\r\nchanged its name to that of the _Orange Eagle._ His office was\r\ndestroyed by fire in 1805, and with the remnants he drove into\r\nNewburgh, purchased the _Recorder of the Times,_ of Dennis Coles, and\r\nchanged its name to the _Political Index,_ under which name it\r\ncontinued until 1829. The _Recorder_ claimed to be Republican in\r\npolitics, but was generally regarded as representing the Federalists\r\nand Burrites. When Mr. Gazlay merged the _Times_ with his Goshen\r\npaper, and evolved therefrom, at Newburgh the _Political Index,_ the\r\ninterests of the Republican party were apparently consolidated. It\r\nsupported Jefferson and Madison, and the War of 1812. Jonathan Fisk\r\nwrote the editorials for the _Index,_ and with the inspiration of\r\nthis able man's articles, the _Index_ cared little for its only\r\ncontemporary, the _Orange County Patriot,_ a Federalist paper, and\r\nthe latter retired to Goshen, whence it came, to become the\r\n_Goshen Democrat._ He sold his _Index_ to Charles M. Cushman, in\r\n1829. Mr. Gazlay served as a magistrate in the village of Newburgh\r\nfor some years, and died there in April, 1836, aged fifty-four years.\r\nHis wife was Bridget, daughter of Jonathan and Bridget Carter, by\r\nwhom he had three sons.\r\n\r\nBEACH, CYRUS; PRATT, LUTHER--At Montgomery, May 6, 1806, appeared\r\nthe names of Cyrus Beach and Luther Pratt, as printers, or rather\r\npublishers, \"for the proprietors,\" of the _Orange County Republican._\r\nThe proprietors were twenty-four \"patriotic citizens of the county.\"\r\nPratt's name remained connected with the paper until 1818, when it\r\nbecame the _Independent Republican,_ with James A. Cheevey as its\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\nHENDRIE, R. C. S--The name of R. C. S. Hendrie appears in Goshen\r\nbetween 1822 and 1834, through coming into proprietorship of the\r\n_Patriot._ He sold it to F. T. Parsons, who changed its name to the\r\n_Goshen Democrat,_ February 22, 1834. In 1843 Mr. Hendrie started the\r\n_True Whig,_ and two years later sold it to Mead & Son, who united\r\nit with the _Democrat_ under the name of the _Democrat and Whig._\r\n\r\nCROWELL, T. B--T. B. Crowell appeared in 1812 as the publisher of\r\nthe _Patriot,_ and in 1822 as its proprietor. Then he passed from the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nVANDYCK, HENRY H.--In 1832 the name of Henry H. Vandyck appears, in\r\nconnection with the purchase of the _Independent Republican_ at\r\nGoshen. In 1836 he was elected to the State Senate. In October, 1839,\r\nhe became proprietor of the _Newburgh Telegraph._ His course in\r\nfavoring the building of the Erie Railroad--a terrible commercial\r\nblow to Newburgh--was so displeasing to the people of Newburgh that\r\nhe disposed of the paper to Elias Pitts, and left. He went to Albany,\r\nand became editor of the _Albany Atlas,_ and was later elected\r\nComptroller of the State. He was a Democrat of the Jackson school.\r\n\r\nVAIL, LEBBEUS L.--Lebbeus Lothrop Vail was born at Middletown, in\r\n1793. His father was Squire Izaiah Vail, a farmer and miller, and his\r\nmother, Azuba Horton. Mr. Vail, after engaging in various\r\noccupations, finally started at Goshen the _Signs of the Times_ in\r\n1832. In 1843 Vail and Denton started the _Democratic Standard,_\r\nwhich afterwards came into the possession of his son Hector, who\r\nchanged its name to the _Goshen Clarion._\r\n\r\nMr. Vail was a highly popular citizen, and was elected county clerk\r\nfor two terms by handsome majorities. He died in 1849, and was buried\r\nin Middletown, but the remains were afterwards transferred to Goshen.\r\nMr. Vail was married to Sally Moon, who lived until 1876.\r\n\r\nCUSHMAN, CHARLES M.--Charles M. Cushman in 1829 purchased Gazlay's\r\n_Political Index_ at Newburgh. He changed it to the _Orange\r\nTelegraph_ and later to the _Newburgh Telegraph._ Mr. Ruttenber says\r\nof him that he was a descendant of Robert Cushman, one of the\r\noriginal company of Pilgrims who sailed for the New World August 5,\r\n1620 (O. S.) He was born in Washington County, N. Y., March 20, 1802,\r\nserved as an apprentice in Rutland, Vt., and subsequently in Boston;\r\nand retired from printing in 1839. He was one of the founders of the\r\nNewburgh public libraries, and also helped to establish the Quassaic\r\nBank, and also the Newburgh Savings Bank. In 1853 he was chosen to\r\nrepresent the first assembly district of Orange County in the\r\nlegislature. In June, 1832, he married Mary, fourth daughter of\r\nCaptain John Birdsall. He died without issue at Rhinebeck, June 1,\r\n1859.\r\n\r\nSPALDING, JOHN D.--A contemporary of Mr. Cushman was John D. Spalding\r\nor Spaulding. He was born in Salem, Mass., January, 1800, and came to\r\nNewburgh in 1815 with his father, the Rev. Joshua Spaulding, of the\r\nPresbyterian Church. He served an apprenticeship as \"devil\" with Ward\r\nM. Gazlay, was subsequently connected with the _Newburgh Gazette_ and\r\nthe _Journal,_ for about thirty-eight years. He married Elizabeth L.,\r\ndaughter of Rev. John Johnston, D.D., of Newburgh, and died August\r\n22, 1853, in his fifty-fourth year. He was survived by several\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nPITTS, ELIAS--Elias Pitts practically succeeded Mr. Cushman in\r\nNewburgh journalism. He was born in Columbia County, N. Y., in 1810,\r\ngraduated at the Kinderhook Academy, served an apprenticeship in the\r\n_Kinderhook Sentinel,_ and became interested in the paper. Later he\r\nwas in the editorial department of the _Rochester Advertiser,_ and\r\nsucceeded Mr. VanDyck on the _Newburgh Telegraph_ in the winter of\r\n1840, which continued until 1850. He was next heard of at\r\nPoughkeepsie as editor of the _Poughkeepsie American._ Soon after\r\n1853 he received an appointment to a clerkship in the State\r\nDepartment at Washington, which continued until his death at\r\nWashington, July 21, 1854. His first wife was Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nJohn Jamieson, of Newburgh. His second wife was Margaret, daughter of\r\nJohn Whited.\r\n\r\nIt is practically at this point that we come to the parting of the\r\nways--the passing of the real pioneers in Orange County journalism.\r\nThe generation has come and gone, so far as activity is concerned,\r\nand we find coming on the stage new actors. They were, however,\r\nevidently of the same mould of character, infusing into their work\r\ntheir personality, and stamping on their productions the ineffable\r\nmarks of strong individuality.\r\n\r\n                 SECOND GENERATION JOURNALISTS.\r\n\r\nDRAKE, VICTOR M.--First and clearly foremost in the second generation\r\nof early journalists was Victor M. Drake. He was born at Milford,\r\nPa., March 20, 1813. His father was Rufus J., a son of Francis Drake,\r\nof Blooming Grove, Orange County, N. Y. From the seventeenth century\r\nthe family had lived in Orange County, in the towns of Goshen and\r\nChester. His great-grandfather, Joseph Drake, was said to be a\r\nlineal descendant of Sir Francis Drake, of England, who died in 1794.\r\nThe mother of V. M. Drake was Rhoda Pierson, a daughter of Rachel\r\nBull, whose mother was a sister of Mary DeWitt, the mother of DeWitt\r\nClinton. At the age of eleven years, Victor M. Drake entered the\r\noffice of the Goshen _Independent Republican,_ where he served as\r\napprentice, journeyman, editor and proprietor of the paper, and in\r\n1846 he became connected with the _New Jersey Herald,_ at Newton, as\r\nreporter, editor and proprietor, remaining there until 1871. Mr.\r\nDrake lived an abstemious, careful, circumspect life, and died in\r\nGoshen in 1894, and his remains repose in the cemetery at that place.\r\n\r\nFrank M. Drake, the present able and dignified editor and proprietor\r\nof the Goshen _Independent Republican,_ is a son of this venerable\r\nand respected journalist, who infused a high standard in local\r\njournalism, and left a name that should ever be revered in Orange\r\nCounty newspaper circles.\r\n\r\nBEEBE, ELDER GILBERT--Elder Gilbert Beebe, the editor of the\r\nold-school Baptist publication, the _Signs of the Times,_ of\r\nMiddletown, for nearly half a century, was the son of David Beebe and\r\nEunice Case. He was born at Norwich, Conn., November 25, 1800, and\r\ndied May 2, 1881 at his home in Middletown, N. Y. He was of the\r\nold-school Baptist faith and was licensed to preach in 1818. In 1823\r\nhe married at New York City, Miss Phoebe A. Cunningham, and the same\r\nyear he was ordained pastor of the Baptist Church at Ramapo, N. Y.\r\nAfter serving pastorates in this church and the Baptist Church at\r\nNew Vernon, he moved to Middletown, N. Y., in 1847, which place\r\nhenceforth became his home, where the remainder of his life was\r\npassed in editorial work on the _Signs,_ which he moved there in\r\n1848, and in expounding the Baptist faith as stated supply for\r\nseveral nearby churches.\r\n\r\nWhen Elder Gilbert Beebe became editor of the _Signs of the Times,_ a\r\nDavid had entered the theological field, armed with the slings of\r\nregeneration, the rocks of inspiration, and the strength of\r\ndevoutness--backed by a printing press and waiting shrines. He was a\r\nworker, and became a power in the land. When Elder Beebe passed away\r\nthe old-school Baptist creed lost its leader, and no one seems to\r\nhave risen to take his place; the stage of Orange County journalism\r\nlost one of its most picturesque figures, the field one of its unique\r\nlandmarks--a type of preacher and editor that has already passed,\r\nnever to return.\r\n\r\nMEAD, CHARLES--A contemporary of Victor M. Drake was Charles Mead,\r\nthough born six years later, November 19, 1819, at Newburgh. His\r\nfather was Xenophon Mead, and his mother was Abigail, daughter of\r\nMoses Burr, a relative of Aaron Burr. Charles Mead was educated\r\nunder the then well-known Goshen teacher, Nathaniel Webb. At the age\r\nof fifteen years he was apprenticed in the office of the _Orange\r\nCounty Patriot,_ under William B. Wright, who afterward became judge\r\nof the supreme court of New York State. He went to Carbondale, Pa.,\r\nin 1839, and remained one year as editor of the _Carbondale Journal._\r\nIn 1841-42 he was employed on _Graham's Magazine,_ in Philadelphia.\r\nMay 9, 1842, he married Caroline A., daughter of Daniel Worden, of\r\nGoshen, who died November 11, 1880. Shortly after his marriage he\r\npurchased the _Goshen Democrat_ of the heirs of Frederick T. Parsons.\r\nIn 1865 he associated with him his son, William B. Mead, and January\r\n1, 1892, sold his interest to Edwin L. Roys. His second wife was\r\nMiss Fannie Jackson, of Goshen. Mr. Mead lived a quiet, unobtrusive\r\nlife, and made his paper a handsomely printed, model conservative\r\nRepublican journal. He died April 22, 1893, and his remains repose in\r\nSt. John's cemetery, Goshen.\r\n\r\nMcNALLY, JAMES J.--One of the men who left their impress on the\r\nprinting art in Orange County, as well as in Sussex and Pike\r\nCounties, was the venerable James J. McNally. He learned the printing\r\ntrade in the office of the _Signs of the Times_ at New Vernon. Thence\r\nhe went to Newton, N. J., and worked on the _New Jersey Herald._ From\r\nthere he went to Milford, Pa., where, it is believed, he started the\r\n_Pike County Democrat,_ which became the _Milford Herald,_ now the\r\n_Dispatch._ In the spring of 1852 he went to Goshen and bought the\r\n_Independent Republican,_ which, seven years later, he sold to Isaac\r\nV. Montanye. In the spring of 1859 he again went to Newton, N. J.,\r\nthis time as the editor and proprietor of the _New Jersey Herald._\r\nThis paper he finally sold and returned to Goshen, and again became\r\nowner of the _Independent Republican._ In 1869 he sold the same to\r\nEdward M. Ruttenber. The same year he became owner of the _Newburgh\r\nTelegraph,_ daily and weekly, purchasing the same of A. A. Bensel. In\r\n1874 he sold it to Dr. Cooper, of Warwick. For a short time he\r\nconducted a grocery store in Middletown, then became connected with\r\nthe _Carmel Courier._ In 1882 he went to Monroe and started the\r\n_Monroe Herald._ In 1888 he started at Goshen the _Goshen News,_ and\r\nfor a time conducted both of these publications, printing them at\r\nGoshen. This he continued until the spring of 1892, when he died, and\r\nboth publications ceased. Mr. McNally was a good printer, a sharp,\r\nwitty writer, and an energetic worker. His son, William C. McNally,\r\nis the owner and editor of the Ellenville (Ulster County) _Press._\r\n\r\nRUTTENBER, EDWARD M.--Edward M. Ruttenber was born in Bennington, Vt.,\r\nJuly 17, 1824, entered the office of the _Vermont Gazette_ in 1837,\r\nas a \"printer's devil,\" came to Newburgh in 1838, as an apprentice\r\nto Charles M. Cushman, an old friend of his father, on the _Newburgh\r\nTelegraph._ Three years later he entered the office of the _Newburgh\r\nGazette,_ where he remained until 1845, when he became foreman of the\r\n_Telegraph,_ then owned by Elias Pitts. In May, 1850, he purchased\r\nthe _Newburgh Telegraph,_ and successfully conducted the same until\r\n1857. It was a weekly, printed on a hand-press. To Mr. Ruttenber\r\nbelongs the honor of bringing to Orange County the first steam-power\r\npress, on which the _Telegraph_ was printed in 1853. In 1851 the\r\n_Telegraph_ absorbed the _Newburgh Excelsior,_ and the _Gazette_ in\r\n1857. Early in 1857 Mr. Ruttenber and E. W. Gray began issuing the\r\n_Daily News_ from the office of the _Telegraph._ Mr. Ruttenber sold\r\nthe plant late in 1857, repurchased it in 1859, sold it in 1861,\r\nrepurchased it in 1866, and in 1867 sold it to A. A. Bensel. In 1869\r\nhe and James J. McNally became owners of the plant. In the autumn of\r\nthat year Mr. Ruttenber retired, to become part owner of the\r\n_Goshen Independent Republican,_ which in 1870, he sold to H. P.\r\nKimber. After leaving that paper he and a younger son started a job\r\nprinting office in Newburgh. From July, 1863, to January, 1865, when\r\nhe resigned, Mr. Ruttenber was engaged in the Bureau of Military\r\nRecords at Albany. Added to his other accomplishments Mr. Ruttenber\r\ndelved deeply and learnedly into historical lore, and became the\r\nfirst authority on Indian nomenclature and the author of four or five\r\nvaluable historical works. The first was a \"History of Newburgh\"\r\n(1859); the next was a work entitled \"Obstructions to Navigation of\r\nHudson's River\": next \"A History of the Flags of the Volunteer\r\nRegiments of the State of New York.\" A \"History of the Indian Tribes\r\nof Hudson's River\" followed, and is a work that is now in great\r\ndemand. In 1875 he began in serial form a \"History of Orange County.\"\r\nHis last work was \"Footprints of the Red Men,\" containing Indian\r\ngeographical names in the valleys of the Hudson, Mohawk and Delaware,\r\ntheir location and probable meaning. This was issued in 1906, and was\r\npublished under the auspices of the New York State Historical\r\nAssociation. In addition to his journalistic and historical work, Mr.\r\nRuttenber found time to work in local educational matters, and in\r\n1870 had served twelve years as a member of the Newburgh board of\r\neducation. In 1846 Mr. Ruttenber married Matilda A., daughter of Mark\r\nMcIntyre, of Newburgh, to whom two sons were born: Charles B., who\r\nbecame a musician of considerable repute, and Walker F., associated\r\nwith his father in the printing business, and editor and publisher of\r\nthe _Newburgh Telegram._ Edward M. Ruttenber died in December, 1907,\r\naged eighty-three years, deeply loved by his family and those who\r\nknew him best, and respected and honored by all. He was a man of\r\ngenial temperament, companionable, and the evening of life found him\r\namiable, courteous, warm-hearted, lovable. Orange County was greatly\r\nenriched by his coming, and impoverished by his going. His grave on\r\nthe banks of the historic Hudson, in the hillside city of his\r\nadoption, should ever be kept green.\r\n\r\nHASBROUCK, JOHN W.--John Whitbeck Hasbrouck, the son of Richard\r\nHasbrouck and Mary Johnson, was born at Woodstock, Ulster County,\r\nN. Y., November 20, 1821. In 1834 the parents of John W. Hasbrouck\r\nremoved from Woodstock to Kingston, where the subject of this sketch\r\ncompleted his education at the famous Kingston Academy, and began his\r\njournalistic career in 1845 with the _Kingston Journal._ In the\r\nspring of 1846 Mr. Hasbrouck purchased the _Sullivan Whig_ at\r\nBloomingburg, Sullivan County, but disposed of it in 1851, and the\r\nsame year went to Middletown, where he started the _Whig Press,_\r\nwhich later became the _Orange County Press,_ merging finally into\r\nthe _Times-Press_ in 1906. Mr. Hasbrouck retired both from his paper\r\nand active journalism in 1868, though his graceful pen was never\r\nentirely idle until stilled by the Great Destroyer in 1907.\r\n\r\nMr. Hasbrouck married Miss Lydia Sayer, M.D., of Warwick, N. Y.,\r\nJuly 27, 1856, who still survives him. He found in this cultured\r\nlady a true help meet, one with ready brain and brawn, and together,\r\nhand in hand, they traveled down life's pathway, with a harmony\r\nseldom paralleled, and the parting of the ways found them with\r\nsilvered heads and the harvest of autumn goldened by the rays of\r\nlife's declining sun.\r\n\r\nHASBROUCK, DR. LYDIA SAYER, was born December 20, 1827, in the town\r\nof Warwick, N. Y. She early determined to fit herself for a\r\nprofessional life, and graduated at the Hygiea Therapeutic College in\r\nNew York, with the degree of doctor of medicine. Mrs. Hasbrouck's\r\nlife-work has been chiefly that of an educator, lecturer and\r\nphysician, and her connection with Orange County journalism was of\r\nbrief duration. For eight years she was editor of her husband's\r\npaper, the _Sybil,_ a semi-monthly reform paper, and she started a\r\npaper called the _Liberal Sentinel._\r\n\r\nMONTANYE, ISAAC V.--Isaac V. Montanye was born May 3, 1825, on the\r\neastern slope of the Shawangunk Mountain near New Vernon, and died\r\nDecember 26, 1906, in the eighty-second year of his age. He entered\r\nthe office of the Goshen _Independent Republican_ in the early\r\nforties, as an apprentice under Victor M. Drake. In 1846 Mr. Montanye\r\nand John S. Clark purchased the _Independent_ of the late Moses B.\r\nSwezey, who had succeeded V. M. Drake. Later Mr. Montanye purchased\r\nMr. Clark's interest, and, in 1853, sold the paper to James J.\r\nMcNally, and in 1875 became, for the second time, the owner of the\r\n_Independent Republican._ A few years later he again sold the plant\r\nto James J. McNally. In 1876 he became owner of the plant for the\r\nthird time, having this time purchased it of T. P. McElrath. In 1883\r\nhe disposed of his interest to his son Lucien Montanye, and Frank\r\nDrake. He had been connected with the _State Journal_ in Madison,\r\nWis., the _Mercury_ at Middletown, the _Telegraph_ at Newburgh, the\r\n_Index_ at Port Jervis, and the _Record_ at Washingtonville. He\r\nstarted the latter two papers, and was connected with the _Record_\r\nwhen he died. Mr. Montanye installed the first cylinder press,\r\nturned by hand, in Orange County, which he set up in the office of\r\nthe _Independent Republican_ in 1850, replacing the old hand-press.\r\nHe also installed the first newspaper folding machine in the\r\n_Middletown Mercury._ In 1870 Mr. Montanye was elected member of\r\nassembly from the second district of Orange County, and later secured\r\nan appointment in the New York custom-house. In 1899 he resigned this\r\nposition, and, with his grandson, Montanye Rightmyer, established the\r\n_Orange County Record_ at Washingtonville.\r\n\r\nMARTIN, CYRUS B.--Cyrus B. Martin appeared in the field in 1861,\r\nwhen he became the purchaser of the _Highland Chieftain,_ and changed\r\nits name to the _Newburgh Daily Journal,_ which it retains to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin was born in Argyle, Washington County, N. Y., September 6,\r\n1830, and having early learned the printer's trade, was employed as a\r\ncompositor on the _Albany Journal,_ where he remained from 1850 to\r\n1855, when he became one of the editors of the _Chenango Telegraph,_\r\npublished at Norwich, N. Y. He continued on this paper until he\r\npurchased the present _Newburgh Daily Journal_ in 1861. Upon severing\r\nhis connection with the latter publication in 1877, he returned to\r\nNorwich, where various interests demanded his care and attention. He\r\nbecame president of that great industry known as the David Maydole\r\nHammer Company, and also president of the Chenango County Bank. He\r\ndeparted this life some years ago while still actively engaged in\r\nbusiness duties.\r\n\r\nRITCHIE, SAMUEL--Samuel Ritchie, who as editor and part proprietor\r\nof the _Newburgh Daily Journal,_ and president of the Newburgh\r\nJournal Company, has been connected with that paper for over\r\nthirty-one years, was born at Larne, Ireland, July 3, 1836. He was\r\nthe son of Robert L. and Sarah E. Ritchie, and came to Newburgh in\r\n1839, where, with the exception of one year, he has resided ever\r\nsince. He was for many years connected with the _Newburgh Daily\r\nJournal_ in a reportorial capacity and as city editor, and on March\r\n1, 1877, with Messrs. Hull and Rodine, he purchased that paper from\r\nCyrus B. Martin, and became its editor, remaining such to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMr. Ritchie has long been recognized as an able editorial writer, and\r\nbeing possessed of a keen wit, he wields a trenchant pen. His kindly\r\nnature, however, has ever rendered him cautious against wantonly\r\ninjuring the feelings of others, and now, in the evening of life, he\r\nreaps the reward of his upright conduct, in the regard and esteem of\r\nhis fellow-men.\r\n\r\nHULL, FRANK S--Frank S. Hull, for many years part proprietor of the\r\n_Newburgh Daily Journal,_ and at present the vice-president and\r\ntreasurer of the Newburgh Journal Company, was born in Newburgh, June\r\n6, 1853. He became while a boy highly interested in printing and\r\nsuccessfully carried on several amateur periodicals. Upon the\r\nretirement of Cyrus B. Martin, in 1877, from the management of the\r\n_Newburgh Daily Journal,_ he was one of the three gentlemen who\r\npurchased the former's interest, and has remained connected with that\r\npaper ever since.\r\n\r\nTUCKER, JOHN F.--John F. Tucker was born in Poughkeepsie, N. Y., on\r\nJuly 3, 1850, and after leaving school became connected with the\r\n_Poughkeepsie Eagle._ He left that paper in 1872 to take charge of\r\nthe Government printing office at West Point, where he remained for\r\ntwelve years, resigning in 1884 to become city editor of the\r\n_Newburgh Register._ With that paper he remained connected as city\r\neditor, part proprietor and sole editor, until its suspension in\r\nFebruary, 1908. Mr. Tucker has been one of the hardest workers among\r\nnewspaper men, and ever noted for the conscientious manner in which\r\nhe discharged the various duties allotted to him. For many years he\r\nhas been the secretary of the Newburgh Board of Trade, and to his\r\nefficiency in office, and active interest in every movement likely to\r\nbenefit his city, is due a great part of the success attained by the\r\nBoard of Trade.\r\n\r\n                   THIRD GENERATION JOURNALISTS.\r\n\r\nThe most recent of the old school of second generation journalists to\r\npass away was the Hon. Isaac V. Montanye, of the _Orange County\r\nRecord,_ at Washingtonville, who died December 6, 1906, and in\r\nDecember, 1907, Edward Ruttenber of Newburgh.\r\n\r\nThere now remains on the stage of life only Mrs. Hasbrouck of the\r\nsecond generation; and of the third generation, Gilbert Van Sciver,\r\nMiddletown; Isaac F. Guiwits, Kansas City; Samuel Ritchie, Newburgh;\r\nWilliam H. Nearpass, Port Jervis; William T. Doty, Port Jervis;\r\nEvander B. Willis, California. These are named in the order of their\r\nappearance in the journalistic field of Orange County, rather than\r\nwith reference to their ages.\r\n\r\nVAN SCIVER, GILBERT--Probably the oldest male printer in the county\r\nto-day is Gilbert Van Sciver, of Middletown. He has been almost\r\ncontinuously \"in the harness\" since 1852 until two years ago (1906),\r\nwhen the _Press_ and _Times_ of that city united. He became an\r\napprentice in the office of John W. Hasbrouck's _Whig Press_ in 1852,\r\nwhen the office was located in the building on North and Depot\r\nstreets, opposite the carpet-bag factory. In 1857 he went to New York\r\nand was there employed as a journeyman for eight years. In 1865 he\r\nreturned to Middletown, and was re-employed in the _Press_ office,\r\nand there remained until the paper lost its identity and merged with\r\nthe _Times._\r\n\r\nNORTON, JAMES H.--August 10, 1854, the name of James H. Norton first\r\nappeared in Orange County journalism. On that date Mr. Norton\r\npurchased the _Tri-States Union_ of Port Jervis, of Lucius F. Barnes,\r\nand there then entered Orange County a journalistic genius--a talent\r\nthat was destined to cut a most important figure in the newspaper\r\nlife of the county and far beyond its boundaries. James Henry Norton\r\nwas born at Goshen, Connecticut, in May, 1823, and after a common\r\nschool education in his native town, he was admitted to the bar\r\nbefore he was twenty-one years old, and was appointed District\r\nAttorney of Wayne County, Pa. He finally decided to abandon the law\r\nfor journalism, and purchased and edited the _Wayne County Herald_\r\nat Honesdale, and some years later sold the plant and went to\r\nBoonville, Oneida County, N. Y., where he started the _Boonville\r\nLedger_ in partnership with H. B. Beardsley. From Boonville he came\r\nto Port Jervis in 1854 and purchased the _Tri-States Union,_ which\r\nhe edited until 1861. In 1862 he removed to Middletown and purchased\r\nG. J. Beebe's _Middletown Mercury,_ which he and Isaac F. Guiwits\r\nmade the brightest country newspaper in the United States. In 1867\r\nhe disposed of his interest in the _Mercury_ to Isaac V. Montanye,\r\nand April 22, 1869, he and William H. Nearpass started the _Evening\r\nGazette,_ tri-weekly, at Port Jervis. A few years later, in company\r\nwith W. H. Nearpass and I. F. Guiwits, he organized a concern known\r\nas the Franklin Printing Company, for printing \"patent insides\" for\r\ncountry newspapers, and in 1882-3 started _The News_ at Middletown,\r\nwhich he sold to Charles Conkling. His later work was as\r\ncorrespondent for the _Sun, Herald_ and _Times._ In 1847 he married\r\nMiss Elizabeth Monson at Bethany, Pa. He died January 20, 1894, at\r\nhis home in Middletown, and his remains rest in Hillside Cemetery.\r\n\r\nGUIWITS, ISAAC F.--Shortly after Mr. Norton came to Orange County, he\r\ninduced a bright young printer from \"up State\" to join him in Port\r\nJervis as a journeyman, and Isaac F. Guiwits came, then a mere boy.\r\nBut he had talents, and Mr. Norton knew it. Young Guiwits accompanied\r\nMr. Norton to Middletown, and the two made the _Middletown Mercury_\r\nthe great country newspaper that it became in the '60's. In 1869 Mr.\r\nGuiwits started the first daily newspaper in Middletown, the _Daily\r\nMail._ Later he was connected with the Franklin Printing Company, and\r\nwhen that merged with the New York Newspaper Union, and became the\r\nUnion Printing Company, Mr. Guiwits still retained an interest and a\r\nposition, and he was sent to St. Louis and later to Kansas City to\r\nmanage a branch of the concern. His wife, who was a Miss Mackey, of\r\nMiddletown, died four years ago, since which time Mr. Guiwits's\r\nhealth has steadily declined. Three years ago he went to Los Angeles,\r\nCalifornia, where he died at the age of sixty-nine, March 25, 1908.\r\nMr. Guiwits was one of the most graceful writers that ever adorned\r\nthe Orange County press.\r\n\r\nFRIEND, DR. JOSEPH D.--One of the able editorial writers on the\r\nDemocratic papers in Middletown from about 1860 to his death in the\r\n'80's, was Dr. Joseph D. Friend. He was a regular medical\r\npractitioner, but preferred newspaper work, and many of the stirring\r\neditorials in the _Mercury,_ the _Mail_ and the _Argus_ were from his\r\ntrenchant pen. For a time he owned the _Mail,_ and when it was merged\r\nwith the _Mercury,_ he became a partner with George H. Thompson, from\r\nwhich he retired in 1874. Dr. Friend was a genial, whole-souled man,\r\nand the writer remembers him as one who gave him encouragement, kind\r\nwords, and good advice at a time when such were needed and did the\r\nmost good.\r\n\r\nNEARPASS, WILLIAM H.--William Henry Nearpass was born in Montague\r\ntownship, Sussex County, N. J., May 9, 1840, being the son of Michael\r\nNearpass and Charlotte E. Stewart. He removed with his parents to\r\nPort Jervis in 1856, and attended the schools there until he was\r\nnineteen, when he embarked in mercantile pursuits which he\r\nsuccessfully pursued until he retired from business to devote himself\r\nto journalism. With Evi Shinier he became the proprietor of the\r\n_Gazette,_ and has retained his interest in that successful\r\npublication ever since.\r\n\r\nMr. Nearpass has always been an active Democrat and very influential\r\nin his party's counsels, having held various village offices, and\r\nelected supervisor of the county nineteen times.\r\n\r\nMr. Nearpass has always enjoyed the highest esteem of his fellow\r\ncitizens, for his character has ever been above reproach, while every\r\npublic duty has been faithfully and ably discharged. During the many\r\nyears he has been the editor of the _Gazette,_ he has never used its\r\ncolumns for the gratification of private spite or the furtherance of\r\nselfish interests, but has always hewed close to the Golden Rule in\r\nall his walks of life; and now the afternoon of his career finds him\r\nwith a blameless life, a clear conscience, a love for his fellow\r\nmortals that no faults of others, injuries, assaults or\r\nmisconceptions have ever chilled.\r\n\r\nMr. Nearpass was twice married, his first wife being Miss Anna W.\r\nNewman, of Brooklyn, L. I., who died in 1879. On September 8, 1881,\r\nhe married Miss Josephine Westfall near Port Jervis.\r\n\r\nDOTY, WILLIAM T.--Mr. Doty was born at Crabtree's Corner, Sussex\r\nCounty, N. J., March 11, 1847. His parents were Jonathan Fisk Doty\r\nand Phoebe Jane Van Wert Doty. Mr. Doty is a descendant of Edward\r\nDoten or Doty, who came over in the Mayflower and settled at\r\nPlymouth, Mass., in 1620. His mother was one of the Van Wert or Van\r\nWart family, one of whom assisted in the capture of Major Andre. Mr.\r\nDoty received a good education in the public and best private schools\r\nof that day.\r\n\r\nMr. Doty's first connection with Orange County journalism was at the\r\nearly age of sixteen, when he became attached to the _Tri-States\r\nUnion_ at Port Jervis, in which latter city he is yet. He afterwards\r\nbecame connected with the _Middletown Mercury,_ the _Banner of\r\nLiberty,_ the _Whig Press,_ the _Signs of the Times,_ and in Col.\r\nFinch's job printing office on Franklin Square when in 1866 S. H.\r\nSayer's _Rising Sun_ flickered above the horizon a few times and\r\ndisappeared. The _Mercury_ and the _Banner of Liberty_ each had\r\noffices in the frame building (now a brick block) next to the\r\nHolding House, on East Main street. When Isaac F. Guiwits started his\r\n_Daily Mail_ in 1869, Mr. Doty set type on it. He was employed on the\r\n_Whig Press_ in 1866, when John W. and Mrs. Lydia Hasbrouck changed\r\nits name to the _Orange County Press._ He was also on the _Press,_\r\nthough not continuously, when, in 1868, it was purchased by Moses D.\r\nand Jesse Lewis Stivers. In the meantime he was employed for several\r\nmonths on the _Warwick Advertiser_ while it was yet conducted by\r\nElder Leonard Cox. It was not until April, 1869, that he returned to\r\nPort Jervis, this time to become foreman of the _Evening Gazette,_ at\r\nthe time James H. Norton and William H. Nearpass started that paper.\r\nExcept for short intervals in Port Jervis and a few months in\r\nWarwick, he was continuously employed in the various Middletown\r\noffices from 1865 to 1869. His personal recollections of the older\r\ninhabitants of that place, and particularly of the newspaper men and\r\nwomen--John W. and Dr. Lydia Sayer Hasbrouck, Elder Gilbert Beebe and\r\nhis sons, G. J. and Benton Beebe, James H. Norton, Isaac F. Guiwits,\r\nHon. Moses D. Stivers, Dr. Joseph D. Friend, Hon. Isaac V. Montanye,\r\nEvander B. Willis, Gilbert Van Sciver, Elder Cox of Warwick, Coe\r\nFinch, E. Malcolm Norton, \"Doxy,\" Charles Coleman and others, is\r\npleasant to recall after half a century's flight of changing years.\r\nLeaving the _Gazette,_ Mr. Doty was a compositor on the New York\r\n_Tribune_ soon after the present structure replaced the squatty old\r\nhome of the office on Printing House Square, and when the\r\ncomposing-room was in the wonderful \"Tall Tower\" overlooking City\r\nHall Park--which structure used to amuse the _Sun_ so much that it\r\nnever tired of being facetious over the Tribune's \"Tall Tower.\" He\r\nwas also a compositor on the _Times_ and the _World_ in those days.\r\nIn 1871 he, in company with Charles St. John, Jr., and Alfred E.\r\nSpooner, bought the _Tri-States Union,_ of Port Jervis, of Foster &\r\nMitchell. They made many changes in the _Union,_ and in politics they\r\nheartily supported Horace Greeley in his candidacy for the\r\nPresidency. They also issued as a campaign paper _The Woodchopper._\r\nIn 1873 he associated with William H. Waller, of Monticello, in\r\nleasing the _Gazette_ of George A. Clement. Some years later he again\r\nwent to New York City, this time as printer in charge of the issuing\r\nof a little Liberal or Free Thought paper called _Man,_ published at\r\n744 Broadway by Thaddeus B. Wakeman and Thoron C. Leland. Later he\r\nbecame reporter on the New York _Star,_ then the Tammany organ, and\r\nprinted at North William street just off of Chatham street (now Park\r\nRow). In the latter part of the '80's he was employed as editor of\r\nthe Port Jervis _Daily Union_ until 1888, when in obedience to a\r\ntelegraphic offer from Morris Koch, manager of William A. Clark's\r\n_Daily Miner,_ he was called to Butte City, Montana, to become\r\neditor of that paper in the interests of the Montana Democrats. He\r\nwent there in June of that year, and in the fall moved his family\r\nthere. In the fall of 1889 he went to the Pacific Coast, with the\r\nintention of going into business in Seattle. He was accompanied by\r\nhis son Vernon, and they spent some time in Portland, Salem, Tacoma,\r\nand Seattle, the lad attending school in this latter city.\r\nUnfortunately Seattle was then a city of tents, a great fire having,\r\nlate in that summer, devastated the whole lower and business section\r\nof the city. In the winter of 1890 Mr. Doty returned East with his\r\nfamily, and became editor of the Middletown _Daily Press_ under\r\nStivers, Slauson & Boyd. The following year he became editor of the\r\n_Orange County Farmer_ of Port Jervis, and remained in that position\r\nuntil 1897, when he returned to Middletown, and associated with\r\nHorace W. Corey in the publishing of the _Sunday Forum._ When that\r\npaper was sold to Thomas Pendell, Mr. Doty returned to Port Jervis as\r\neditor of the _Daily Union,_ which position he occupies at this time\r\n(March, 1908).\r\n\r\nWilliam T. Doty and Catharine Elizabeth, the daughter of Andrew W.\r\nDickert, of Youngsville, Warren County, Pa., were married October 6,\r\n1875. Three children bless that union: Gwendolen, the wife of John S.\r\nHatch, Jr., of near Scotchtown, this county; Vernon Dickert Doty,\r\ntrain dispatcher on the Panama R. R. at Colon; Louaine, wife of\r\nCharles A. Miller, of Midland Lake, near Middletown. A fourth child,\r\nWentworth Doty, died in Port Jervis, March 12, 1888, aged thirteen\r\nmonths. There are four grandchildren: Helen and Louaine Miller, and\r\nNaomi and Llewellyn Hatch. Mr. Doty's home is at Circleville, this\r\ncounty, where he has a \"little farm well tilled\" that affords him\r\nmore comfort and pleasure than all that the cities or town can offer.\r\nDuring his many years of residence in Port Jervis, and where his\r\nchildren were born, he was for twelve years a more or less active\r\nfireman and a member of Delaware Engine, and later, Hose Company No.\r\n2, which he joined in 1863, and of which he was foreman two years.\r\nLater he was first assistant chief engineer two years, acting as\r\nchief one year, after the removal of Leopold Fuerth, the chief, to\r\nHonesdale. He is a member of Port Jervis Lodge No. 328, F. A. M.,\r\nand Neversink Chapter 186, R. A. M., of which he joined the former in\r\n1871 and the latter in 1872. He is also a member of Delaware\r\nCommandery No. 44, Knights Templar, and of Mecca Temple A. A. O. N.\r\nM. S., of New York City; past grand of Utsayantha Lodge of Odd\r\nFellows and past chief patron of Deerpark Encampment, I. O. O. F.,\r\nand was the first chancellor commander of Mount William Lodge 105,\r\nK. of P.; is a member of Orange Chapter No. 33, O. E. S., and of\r\nPort Jervis Lodge No. 645, B. P. O. Elks.\r\n\r\nCOX, ELDER LEONARD--Elder Leonard Cox came to Warwick early in the\r\n'60's as an Old School Baptist preacher and started the _Warwick\r\nAdvertiser._ The _Advertiser_ not only lives, but after 42 years of\r\nuseful existence is to-day a monument to the preacher-editor's\r\njudgment, force of character and early craftsmanship. In 1868 or 1869\r\nMr. Cox returned to Virginia, where he is still living and editing,\r\nin connection with his son, the _Charlotte Gazette,_ at Charlotte\r\nCourt-House, Va., and still active at the age of ninety years. The\r\nwriter has very pleasant personal recollections of this venerable\r\nworker, having for a time been employed in his office in Warwick as a\r\njourneyman printer.\r\n\r\nSTIVERS, HON. MOSES D.--The name of Moses Dunning Stivers deserves\r\nan important niche in the county's journalistic gallery, for, after\r\nhe began to take part in newspaper work, he was an active, energetic,\r\nprogressive and leading factor. He was an able writer--incisive and\r\nwonderfully effective. He was well educated, ever affable and\r\ncourteous, a clean-cut gentleman. He first appeared in active\r\nconnection with journalism in March, 1868, when he purchased of John\r\nW. Hasbrouck the _Orange County Press_ in association with his\r\nbrother, Lieutenant Jesse L. Stivers. The latter was a practical\r\nprinter, had twice enlisted in the army in the Civil War, and died in\r\nNew York City, April 30, 1871, aged thirty years. Hon. M. D. Stivers\r\nwas with the _Press_ when the _Evening Press_ (tri-weekly) was\r\nstarted, and later when the tri-weekly became a daily edition. He was\r\ninstrumental in making it one of the leading country Republican\r\npapers of the State. Associated with him, at different times, in the\r\nbusiness and editorial departments of the Press, were John W.\r\nSlauson, Charles J. Boyd, Albert Kessinger, and F. Stanhope Hill. In\r\nDecember, 1880, Mr. Stivers sold his interest in the concern to John\r\nW. Slauson, and retired.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, in conjunction with his two sons, Lewis S. and John D.\r\nStivers, Mr. Stivers started the _Middletown Times._ From the first\r\nthis paper was a success, and the popularity it attained at its\r\ninception has never waned, but continued after the death of their\r\nfather in February, 1895. Moses D. Stivers was born near Bennerville,\r\nSussex County, N. J., December 30, 1828, and was the son of John\r\nStivers and Margaret Dunning, his wife. In 1845 the family purchased\r\nand removed to the Deacon Hallock farm at Ridgebury in this county.\r\nMr. Stivers attended both the public and private schools, finishing\r\nhis education at the Ridgebury Academy, after leaving which, for\r\nseveral years, he taught school winters and worked his fathers farm\r\nsummers.\r\n\r\nOn September 26, 1855, he married Mary Elizabeth Stewart, of\r\nWawayanda, and then for two years kept a store at Ridgebury, and in\r\n1859 engaged in the mercantile business in Middletown, first under\r\nthe firm name of Evans & Stivers, and then under that of Stivers &\r\nWallace. In 1864 Mr. Stivers was elected county clerk, and in 1868 he\r\nbecame connected with journalism by the purchase of the _Orange\r\nCounty Press._\r\n\r\nMr. Stivers held several political offices besides that of county\r\nclerk, being postmaster at Ridgebury under President Pierce, was\r\nappointed collector of internal revenue in 1868 for this district,\r\nand was elected to Congress. Mr. Stivers was also active in civic\r\naffairs, being a director of the Unionville and Water Gap Railroad,\r\na trustee of the Middletown Asylum for the Insane, and of the\r\nHillside Cemetery; also a trustee of the Middletown Savings Bank. He\r\nalso took a keen interest in firemanic affairs, and filled the\r\nhighest offices in the lodges of the Free Masons and Odd Fellows.\r\n\r\nMr. Stivers was a man of strong personality, indomitable will-power,\r\nand diplomatic and statesmanlike qualities, which made him a\r\ncommanding figure in Orange County politics and journalism.\r\n\r\nST. JOHN, CHARLES.--When he was in the work there was no more\r\nenthusiastic or energetic newspaper man in Orange County than Charles\r\nSt. John, Jr., the founder of the Port Jervis _Daily Union_ (1873),\r\nand the _New York Farmer_ (1881). He entered the journalistic field\r\nin 1871 in company with W. T. Doty and A. E. Spooner, when the three\r\npurchased the _Tri-States Union_ at Port Jervis. For years he was\r\nmore or less active in the work, and retained an interest in the\r\n_Union_ and the _Farmer,_ until October, 1907, when his partner and\r\nbrother-in-law, Fred R. Salmon, purchased his entire interest in the\r\ntwo papers. While Mr. St. John could write energetically and with\r\nmuch effect, it was as an organizer, solicitor and business hustler\r\nthat he shone brightest. Mr. St. John was a graduate of the famous\r\nold Mt. Retirement Seminary in Sussex County, N. J., near Deckertown,\r\nand of the Eastman Business College at Poughkeepsie. He was born in\r\nPort Jervis, August 30, 1849, a son of Hon. Charles St. John, of Port\r\nJervis, and Ellen S. Thompson, of near Marlboro, Ulster County. The\r\nSt. Johns were an old family, that early came from Connecticut to\r\nNew York State, and nearly a century ago Stephen St. John came to\r\nPort Jervis and purchased nearly all the land where Port Jervis now\r\nstands. In 1870 Charles St. John, Jr., married Miss Mary Salmon at\r\nHonesdale, Pa., a daughter of Conductor Charles M. Salmon and\r\nJeannette Russell.\r\n\r\nFOWLER, ERWIN GALLATIN.--Erwin Gallatin Fowler, who started the\r\n_Sunday Call_ in Port Jervis, and for several years edited the\r\n_Daily Union_ and the _Orange County Farmer,_ was born at Walden,\r\nN. Y., November 28, 1837, and died April 3, 1904. His parents were\r\nCharles Fowler and Millie Ann Lehman. He attended the schools at\r\nWalden, became a teacher, enlisted in the Duryea Zouaves, went to the\r\nfront in the Civil War and became first lieutenant. After the war he\r\nwas employed in Newburgh for a while, part of the time on the\r\n_Journal._ In 1870 he removed to Huguenot, and in 1872 became\r\nconnected with the _Port Jervis Union._ Later he started the _Sunday\r\nCall,_ and was called hence to Middletown to edit the _Daily Press._\r\nSeptember 8, 1881, he became editor of the _Orange County Farmer,_\r\njust started, and remained with this paper until he and John J.\r\nDillon bought the Elmira _Husbandman,_ going thence to the _Rural\r\nNew-Yorker_ and later to the _American Agriculturist._ The last work\r\nthat he did in the editorial line was as editor of the _Orange County\r\nFarmer,_ when fatal illness stilled forever his able pen. During the\r\nWorld's Fair at Chicago in 1893 he had charge of the New York\r\nhorticultural exhibit. Mr. Fowler, in addition to his editorial work,\r\ninterested himself considerably in musical matters, and was president\r\nof the Orange County Musical Union. As a writer Mr. Fowler was able,\r\nready, and facile. His homilies were not long-drawn-out, but were\r\nwonderfully effective, and his descriptive powers were fine. He had\r\nan extensive knowledge of agricultural matters, and when in charge of\r\nthe _Orange County Farmer_ put that paper on a high plane, and made\r\nit popular and its circulation grew to large proportions. Personally,\r\nMr. Fowler was genial, the soul of good-nature, philanthropic and\r\nbenevolent to the last degree. Mr. Fowler and Miss Fannie F. Dunning\r\nwere married March 19, 1862.\r\n\r\nMOTT, ED. H.--Though not directly connected with Orange County\r\njournalism, Ed. H. Mott, the well-known writer and correspondent of\r\nthe New York _Sun,_ was for a time, in 1871, editor of the _Gazette,_\r\nand after that the _Daily Union_ at Port Jervis. Mr. Mott was too\r\nrestless to be tied down to the drudgery of the daily grind on a\r\nnewspaper, and in time he found himself in the regular employ of the\r\nNew York _Sun,_ with a desk in that office, grinding out Pike County\r\ntale's and character delineations that brought him notoriety and\r\nshekels galore. He is at present located in Goshen, and yet writing\r\nfor the New York _Sun._ He also wrote a history of the Erie Railroad,\r\nwhich is valuable and a high-priced production. Mr. Mott is a gifted\r\nwriter. His witticisms, character sketches, and stories generally are\r\noriginal, unique, and clever.\r\n\r\nVAN FREDENBERG, HENRY ABSALOM--One of the ablest writers in the\r\nState to-day; one who has such command of words that they are as\r\nplaythings to a child; a remarkable linguist; mathematician,\r\nbotanist, chemist, geologist, and all-round naturalist, with\r\nabilities which his own modesty and lack of self-appreciation prevent\r\nhim from fully recognizing--is the genius who is doing editorial work\r\non an Orange County paper to-day. The writer of these lines has for\r\nmany years known the gentleman, worked side by side with him, tried\r\nto fathom the depth and height, the breadth and length of his\r\nmarvelous mentality. While it is a pleasure to make record of these\r\nfacts, it is done with hesitation for fear of misconception,\r\nmisconstruction, and misinterpretation. Henry Absalom Van Fredenberg\r\nwas born in the town of Montague, Sussex County, N. J., December 30,\r\n1849. His parents were the late Aaron Van Fredenberg and Marie De Witt\r\nVan Fredenberg. His parents, in 1850, moved from Montague, N. J., to\r\nSparrowbush, N. Y., where his youth was passed. He was educated in\r\nthe public schools and in Professor A. B. Wilbur's seminary in Port\r\nJervis, and at an early age became a school teacher. He taught in\r\nSparrowbush, Sanfordville, Mount Hope, Otisville, Slate Hill, and\r\nDeckertown (now Sussex), N. J. In Deckertown he became interested in\r\njournalism and edited the _Sussex Independent_ for several years. He\r\nedited the Port Jervis _Daily Union,_ the Washington (N. J.) _Star,_\r\nand the Mauch Chunk (Pa.) _Coal Gazette_ and _Daily Times_ in\r\nsuccession. In 1885 he went to Buffalo, N. Y., where he served as\r\neditor-in-chief of the _Lumber World, Milling World, The American\r\nTanner,_ the _Iron Industry Gazette,_ the _American Woodworker,_ and\r\nthe _Factory and Dealers' Supply World._ In that city he served as\r\nassociate editor of _The Magazine of Poetry,_ now merged with _Poet\r\nLore,_ of Boston, Mass. In 1898 he returned to Orange County, making\r\nhis home in Sparrowbush. Mr. Van Fredenberg succeeded the late Erwin\r\nG. Fowler as editor of the _Orange County Farmer_ in 1899 (now the\r\n_New York Farmer_), and is in that position at this date (March,\r\n1908), making the _New York Farmer_ an authority on all dairy\r\nmatters, and quoted extensively wherever dairy interests have an\r\nintelligent force.\r\n\r\nSTIVERS, LEWIS STEWART--Lewis Stewart Stivers was born in the town\r\nof Wawayanda, Orange County, April 20, 1859, the oldest son of Hon.\r\nMoses D. and Mary Elizabeth Stewart Stivers. After his parents\r\nremoved to Middletown he attended the public schools in that city and\r\nthe Wallkill Academy, and then entered Peekskill Military Academy,\r\nfrom which he graduated in 1876. On concluding his studies, he\r\nentered the office of the _Middletown Press,_ of which his father was\r\nthen editor and part owner and in 1891 he and his brother, John D.\r\nStivers, began the publication of the _Middletown Daily Times_ and\r\nthe _Orange County Times,_ the latter a semi-weekly issue. He was\r\nunited in marriage, in Middletown, with Miss Cora D. Mackey, daughter\r\nof John Mackey, who, for many years, was connected with the Orange\r\nCounty Foundry Company. Mr. Stivers died October 30, 1905, deeply\r\nlamented by everyone who knew him, for he was the soul of honor, the\r\nfriend of all; courteous, amiable, generous.\r\n\r\nSLAUSON, JOHN WHITING--Many bright minds have been engaged in the\r\nfield of Orange County journalism. It is not vaunting to say that one\r\nof the keenest of these was he who made his entrance into active\r\nnewspaper life October 15, 1872, by the purchase of the _Orange\r\nCounty Press_ of Stivers & Kessinger at Middletown, and under him the\r\n_Press,_ already influential and highly respected, became one of the\r\nleading Republican journals of the State. Mr. Slauson remained with\r\nthe _Press_ thirty-three years, associating in its management with F.\r\nStanhope Hill one year, the Hon. Moses D. Stivers seven years, and\r\nCharles J. Boyd twenty-five years, retiring from the printing\r\nbusiness in 1906. In all these years the _Press_ property became very\r\nvaluable, owning one of the finest locations in Middletown, and\r\nconducted in such a manner that it was a positive pleasure to be\r\nemployed therein. Mr. Slauson is a writer of ability, using the\r\nchoicest language in diction, structure in phrasing, and style\r\nenriched with the higher graces of composition. John Whiting Slauson\r\nwas born September 18, 1846, in the town of Greenville, this county.\r\nHis father was David Slauson, and his mother was Antoinette, daughter\r\nof John Whiting, a member of a prominent Connecticut family. Mr.\r\nSlauson attended the Westtown Academy and the Dolbear School for\r\nYoung Men in New York City, and at the age of twenty began teaching\r\nin the public schools of the county, and after filling an unexpired\r\nterm as school commissioner of the Second District of Orange County,\r\nhe purchased an interest in the _Press_ and thenceforth devoted\r\nhimself to journalism. In 1875 Mr. Slauson married Miss Olivia,\r\ndaughter of Horatio R. Wilcox, of Middletown. For over twenty-five\r\nyears Mr. Slauson has been a member of the New York State Press\r\nAssociation, was one of its vice-presidents in 1894, and is still an\r\nactive member of the Republican Editorial Association of this State.\r\n\r\nMr. Slauson's reputation for fair dealing and steady adherence to the\r\nprinciples of the Golden Rule in all relations of life, have earned\r\nfor him the merited esteem of his townsmen generally, and the highest\r\nregard of those who know him best--a pleasure falling to the writer\r\nmany years ago, and he cherishes the friendship thus formed as one of\r\nthe pleasantest incidents in his life.\r\n\r\nMACARDELL, CORNELIUS--An important factor in Orange County\r\njournalism entered when Cornelius Macardell came, and a distinct loss\r\nwhen he passed away. He founded the _Daily Argus_ in 1876 at\r\nMiddletown and in 1878 consolidated the _Argus_ and _Mercury._ In\r\n1896 he turned the control of the paper over to his son, Cornelius,\r\nand his official connection with journalism ceased from that date.\r\n\r\nCornelius Macardell was born at Darien, Georgia, October 24, 1837,\r\nthe son of Cornelius and Rebecca Campbell Macardell, and returned\r\nwith his family to New York in 1841. He was educated in the public\r\nschools of Brooklyn, and then, after a few years of reporting for the\r\ncity papers, became interested in a newspaper venture in New Orleans.\r\nIn 1861 he came North, entered Wall street, New York, and in 1866\r\nbecame a member of the Stock Exchange. A few years later he retired\r\nfrom the street and bought a farm near Mount Hope in Orange County.\r\nIn 1877 be again became active in Wall street, but he sold out his\r\nseat in the Stock Exchange a number of years ago. For years Mr.\r\nMacardell was interested in banking in Middletown, and was elected\r\npresident of the First National Bank in 1891. He was also interested\r\nin many ways with other business institutions in Middletown, and his\r\nbusiness life was full of activities. In 1860 Mr. Macardell married\r\nEsther, daughter of Oliver and Penelope Crawford, of near Middletown.\r\nMr. Macardell died April 9. 1904, lamented by everyone who knew the\r\ngenial, kindly old gentleman.\r\n\r\nTHOMPSON, GEORGE H.--An able journalist of the fourth generation in\r\nOrange County was George H. Thompson, whose work began on the\r\n_Middletown Mercury_ about 1873. He was educated at Williams College,\r\nhad a good style in writing, and was one of the brightest and most\r\nsatirical writers in the county. He also made a good editor and until\r\nhis death, a few years ago, kept the columns of the _Argus_ and the\r\n_Mercury_ alive with his bright sayings and well-rounded sentences.\r\nMr. Thompson was at one time president of the Board of Education of\r\nMiddletown, and for a short time was postmaster under President\r\nCleveland. His wife was a daughter of Colonel D. C. Dusenberry, but\r\nboth have passed away, leaving one daughter, Maysie Thompson.\r\n\r\nWINCHESTER, REV. CHARLES M.--About 1874 the Rev. Charles M.\r\nWinchester, who came to Middletown from one of the New England States\r\nto preach temperance and the Gospel according to the Free Christian\r\nChurch, started the _Standard,_ an afternoon paper, and forthwith\r\nengaged in newspaper work of the most lively character. To say that\r\naffairs grew hot in Middletown for a year or two, is to state facts\r\nvery moderately. Mr. Winchester was bubbling over with his ideas of\r\ntheology, temperance and morals, and his powers of invective seemed\r\nunlimited. He preached Sundays and through the week in tents and\r\nother places, and hurled his javelins of wit, of satire, of\r\ndenunciation, of imprecation, and execration orally from the pulpit,\r\nand daily through his paper. The _Standard_ was finally purchased by\r\nthe _Mercury_ people, and Mr. Winchester went to New York, where he\r\ndied a year or two ago.\r\n\r\nSALMON, FRED R.--Fred R. Salmon, the present business manager of the\r\n_New York Farmer_ and the Port Jervis _Daily Union_ and _Tri-States\r\nUnion_ plants, was born at Susquehanna, Pa., January 18, 1858. His\r\nparents were Charles M. and Jeannette Russell Salmon. The family\r\nremoved to Port Jervis and then to Honesdale, in both of which places\r\nMr. Salmon attended schools, graduating from the Honesdale High\r\nSchool. He entered the office of the Port Jervis _Union_ in April,\r\n1877, as bookkeeper for his brother-in-law, Charles St. John. In 1884\r\nhe entered into partnership with Mr. St. John under the firm name of\r\nSt. John & Salmon. In 1895 they organized the Tri-States Publishing\r\nCompany, as its sole owners. This concern continued until October 1,\r\n1907, when Mr. Salmon purchased Mr. St. John's interest, and became\r\nthe sole owner of the stock. October 6, 1889, Mr. Salmon married\r\nMiss Flora Dunning, daughter of Joseph and Clara Owen Dunning, of\r\nnear Middletown. For several years Mr. Salmon was secretary of the\r\nRepublican County Committee and prominent in the councils of his\r\nparty. He is now a member of the Civil Service Commission of the new\r\ncity of Port Jervis; is a member of the Board of Education; is\r\ntrustee of the First Presbyterian Church, and a trustee of the Port\r\nJervis Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nDRAKE, FRANK M.--The present editor of the Goshen _Independent\r\nRepublican_ is Frank Drake, who became connected therewith as part\r\nowner January 1, 1883, and sole owner in March, 1892. Mr. Drake is a\r\npractical printer, an able writer, and is a \"worthy son of a worthy\r\nsire.\" His father was Victor M. Drake, one of the Nestors of Orange\r\nCounty journalism, and the son is giving in the semi-weekly issues of\r\nhis _Independent Republican_ evidence that the \"journalistic\r\ninstincts\" of the father have descended to the son. He is a Democrat\r\nof the conservative type; is sprightly in his treatment of all\r\nsubjects, and deftly sprinkles a bit of attic salt in much of the\r\npalatable literary provender that he sets before his readers. Mr.\r\nDrake was born at Newton, N. J., in 1855, and after his school days\r\nhe entered the office of the _Independent Republican,_ after his\r\nparents removed to Goshen, and became an apprentice in 1874, at the\r\nage of nineteen years. He never found it necessary or advisable to\r\nmigrate, and it is fitting that he should find his life work in the\r\nvery office in which the genius of his gifted father for so many long\r\nyears was exercised for the public good. Mr. Drake is unmarried.\r\n\r\nKETCHUM, GEORGE F.--With the establishment at Warwick in 1885 of the\r\n_Warwick Valley Dispatch_ there entered the arena of Orange County\r\njournalism a champion who has proven his right to become a leader.\r\nGeorge F. Ketchum, who founded the _Dispatch,_ is the son of the late\r\nGeorge W. Ketchum and Elizabeth Strang Wright. George F. Ketchum has\r\nmade his _Dispatch_ the leading Democratic paper in the county, by\r\nreason of his unquestioned honesty of purpose, his fearless but\r\nalways fair and courteous advocacy of principles which he believed\r\nconducive to the public weal, his persistent, aggressive efforts, and\r\nhis fair treatment of all opponents. Mr. Ketchum has been for more\r\nthan a decade the chairman of the Democratic County Committee--a\r\nposition that he has not held through mere favoritism, but by reason\r\nof the force of character and the indomitable energy that has\r\ncharacterized his whole public career.\r\n\r\nBOYD, CHARLES J.--About 1880 Charles J. Boyd became interested in\r\nnewspaper work through partnership with John W. Slauson, under the\r\nthe name of Slauson & Boyd, as publishers of the _Middletown Press._\r\nMr. Boyd remained with the _Press_ until it was merged with the\r\n_Times_ in 1906, when he retired from the work, to engage in\r\ninsurance and real estate business. Mr. Boyd was a first-class\r\nnewspaper man in every particular. He wrote a good article, had neat\r\ndescriptive powers, good judgment, clear discernment and\r\ndiscrimination, and his work was ever in evidence on the Press. It\r\nwould seem that one so clever, so well endowed by nature for\r\nnewspaper work, should have remained in the field. Mr. Boyd was\r\nsupervisor of his ward for a number of years, and made one of the\r\nmost efficient members of the county legislature. He was also by\r\nappointment one of the Prison Commissioners of the State.\r\n\r\nSTIVERS, JOHN D.--In 1891 John D. Stivers entered actively into\r\njournalistic duties, though he had been connected therewith more or\r\nless all his life. In that year the _Middletown Times_ came into\r\nexistence, and he became its normal editor. Since the lamented death\r\nof his father, the Hon. Moses D. Stivers, in February, 1895, John D.\r\nStivers has been the real head and front of the establishment. Mr.\r\nStivers is a young man who deservedly stands well with his party and\r\nthe public. Through its well-written editorials, its daily supply of\r\nthe local and general news served in the most concise and acceptable\r\nmanner, the _Times_ is a power in politics and in general thought\r\nthat needs to be reckoned with by politicians and caterers to the\r\npublic in any form whatever. John Dunning Stivers was born August 30,\r\n1861, at Middletown, N. Y., the second son of the Hon. Moses D. and\r\nMary Elizabeth Stewart Stivers. He attended the public schools of\r\nMiddletown and Wallkill Academy, where the rudiments of his education\r\nwere obtained, and later Peekskill Military Academy, from which\r\ninstitution he was graduated in 1878, at the age of seventeen years.\r\nHe then began his journalistic career, entering the office of the\r\nMiddletown _Press_ as bookkeeper and later filling the position of\r\ncity editor. Resigning from the _Press,_ Mr. Stivers became private\r\nsecretary to his father, the Hon. Moses D. Stivers, during his term\r\nas Member of Congress from this district. Upon the latter's\r\nretirement from office, John D. Stivers returned to Middletown, and,\r\nwith his brother, Lewis S. Stivers, established the _Middletown\r\nTimes._ After the death of his father, he was elected to take the\r\nlatter's place as trustee of the Orange County Trust Company. Mr.\r\nStivers was appointed a member of the Board of Managers of the\r\nMiddletown State Hospital by Governor Morton, and was secretary of\r\nthe Board for several years, and until the reorganization of the\r\nasylum management throughout the State by Governor Odell.\r\n\r\nNICKINSON, ALBERT E.--Albert E. Nickinson, the present treasurer and\r\ngeneral business manager of the Middletown _Argus_ and _Mercury,_ was\r\nborn in Cincinnati, Ohio, July 8, 1863. He was a son of John\r\nNickinson and Elizabeth J. Phillips. Albert E. was educated in the\r\npublic schools of Indianapolis, Philadelphia, and Suffern, N. Y. He\r\nentered the employ of the _Argus_ and _Mercury_ in 1888, remained\r\nuntil 1901, and returned to the office upon its reorganization as a\r\nnew company in 1906. Mr. Nickinson is a good business man, and when\r\nnecessary can wield a descriptive pen. On November 28, 1889, Mr.\r\nNickinson and Miss Penelope Macardell were married.\r\n\r\nSPEIDEL, MERRITT C.--The present efficient associate business manager\r\nof the Port Jervis _Daily Union, Tri-States Union_ and _New York\r\nFarmer_ is Merritt C. Speidel. He was born May 19, 1879, in Port\r\nJervis, son of Martin and Hannah M. Patterson Speidel, members of\r\nwell-known Deerpark families. During his student days he frequently\r\nwrote for the local newspapers, and on October 25, 1897, he became\r\nemployed in the business department of the Tri-States Publishing\r\nCompany, and several months later became reporter for the Port Jervis\r\n_Daily Union,_ and then successively city editor, associate editor,\r\nand editor. January 1, 1904, he became associate business manager of\r\nthe Tri-States Publishing Co., and in January, 1908, became secretary\r\nand a director of the company. Mr. Speidel, though a young man, has\r\nbeen much identified with local public affairs and is now serving his\r\nseventh year as secretary of the Port Jervis Board of Trade; is one\r\nof the Health Commissioners; is president of the Deerpark\r\norganization of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle.\r\n\r\nPOWERS, HENRY P.--Henry P. Powers, city editor and desk man of the\r\nMiddletown _Daily Argus_ and semi-weekly _Mercury,_ was born at\r\nGroton, Tompkins County, N. Y., June 30, 1857, a son of Jacob B.\r\nPowers and Nancy G. Bouton. He early developed a love for the\r\nprinting trade and entered the office of the _Groton Journal,_ when a\r\nlad, as apprentice, serving there seven years, and about eighteen\r\nyears ago he came into Orange County and located at Middletown. For a\r\nyear and a half he was employed as city editor of the Middletown\r\n_Daily Press._ In January, 1903, he became reporter for and then\r\ncity editor of the _Daily Argus._ Mr. Powers is a thoroughly good\r\nnewspaper man; active, reliable, a ready writer, of good\r\ndiscrimination, and he is a valuable addition to Orange County\r\njournalism. Mr. Powers was twice married. His first wife died at\r\nGroton twenty-two years ago. His second wife was Miss Minnie L. Hill,\r\ndaughter of John W. Hill, of Middletown.\r\n\r\nGREGG, GEORGE F.--In January, 1903, George F. Gregg, in company with\r\nJohn B. Scott, became part owner of the _Goshen Democrat,_ and\r\nSeptember 1, 1905, he became sole owner of the same. To say that he\r\nhas made the _Democrat_ a bright, newsy, weekly paper is to express\r\nthe fact mildly but justly. He is a vigorous writer, with a fervor\r\nand animation that is born of the intensity of earnestness and zeal,\r\nand he is surely making the _Democrat_ read by friends and political\r\nfoes. In 1906 Mr. Gregg was elected supervisor of the town of Goshen,\r\nand again in 1907, and brings to this public office the same\r\nearnestness, push and capacity that characterizes his work as an\r\neditor. Mr. Gregg is yet a young man, and he is in a fair way to be\r\none of the leaders of thought and action in Orange County. George F.\r\nGregg was born at Walden, N. Y., April 30, 1875. His parents were\r\nEdgar M. Gregg, of Walden, and Rose L. Faron, of Corning, N. Y. His\r\neducation was at the public schools. He passed several years in\r\nChenango County, this State. For a short time he was connected with\r\nthe advertising department of the New York _Times._ He was also in\r\nthe Ordnance Department of the United States Navy, in the naval\r\nmagazine at Fort Lafayette. Mr. Gregg seemed to have an \"intuitive\r\nleaning\" to journalistic work, for in addition to his service on the\r\nNew York _Times,_ we find he was fifteen years in newspaper work,\r\nseveral of which were in the office of the \"now esteemed\r\ncontemporary,\" the _Independent Republican._ For two years he was\r\ncity editor of the _Middletown Argus,_ immediately prior to\r\npurchasing an interest in the _Goshen Democrat._ The good work he is\r\ndoing in the columns of that old paper, and the esteem in which he is\r\nheld by the people of Goshen, as shown by his being twice chosen as\r\nsupervisor of the town, is evidence that he has found his life's work\r\nand its field. Mr. Gregg and Miss Jane A. Brundage, of Newark, N. J.,\r\nwere married July 11, 1900.\r\n\r\nTAFT, LYMAN H.--One of the most thoroughly independent editors in the\r\ncounty is Lyman H. Taft, of the Montgomery _Standard-Reporter,_ who\r\nwas born December 5, 1865, at Oneida Valley, Madison County, N. Y.\r\nHis father was Thomas J. Taft, and his mother was Jane Baum, whose\r\nfather, Rev. John Baum, was a Methodist minister at Mendenville,\r\nN. Y. The parents went to the Pennsylvania oil country, when Lyman\r\nwas but three months old, and settled at Warren, Pa. He attended the\r\nWarren high school, leaving the same to enter the office of the\r\nWarren _Ledger_ (1877), where he served an apprenticeship of three\r\nyears, and then traveled over the country, working as a journeyman\r\nprinter, and visited forty States of the Union. September 1, 1888, he\r\narrived at Montgomery, purchased the _Recorder_ and in 1898 the\r\n_Standard,_ and consolidated the two papers under the title of the\r\n_Standard and Reporter._\r\n\r\nMacGOWAN, HORACE A.--Horace A. MacGowan, city editor of the\r\nMiddletown _Daily Argus,_ was born January 7, 1877, near Circleville,\r\nthis county, a son of John Nelson and Julia Woodruff MacGowan, and\r\nof Scotch ancestry. His parents removed to Middletown when Horace was\r\nbut four years of age, and he attended the schools until thirteen\r\nyears of age, when (July, 1891) he entered the employ of the\r\nMiddletown _Daily Press,_ where he remained fifteen years. When the\r\n_Press_ was merged with the _Times,_ Mr. MacGowan, February 1, 1906,\r\nbecame city editor of the Middletown _Daily Argus,_ which position he\r\nstill holds. Mr. MacGowan has time and again proven his capability as\r\na good writer and newspaper man by work of recognized merit. April\r\n23, 1903, he married Miss Elizabeth Tappan, daughter of Mrs.\r\nCatherine Tappan, of Middletown.\r\n\r\nMACARDELL, CORNELIUS, JR.--Cornelius Macardell was educated in the\r\npublic schools of Middletown, and entered the office of the _Argus_\r\nin 1891, becoming publisher of the _Argus_ and _Mercury_ in 1896, and\r\ncontinuing in that capacity until the formation of the corporation in\r\nMarch, 1906. He is president of the Argus and Mercury Company.\r\n\r\nRICHARDS, MARK V.--The city editor of the Port Jervis _Gazette_ since\r\n1905 is Mark V. Richards, an industrious, alert reporter, a\r\ndescriptive writer, and a conscientious, painstaking worker. Mr.\r\nRichards was born in Port Jervis, February 24, 1880, the son of David\r\nS. and Martha Isadore Bunting Richards. Mark V. Richards graduated\r\nfrom the Port Jervis High School, June 24, 1898. He began newspaper\r\nwork, January 2, 1897, as a paper carrier for the _Gazette._ In the\r\nyear and a half thus employed he was constantly picking up bits of\r\nnews for the _Gazette,_ often writing them out in such readable form\r\nthat he attracted the attention of Editors Nearpass and Bennet, with\r\nthe result that at the first opportunity he was engaged as reporter\r\nfor the _Gazette._ This work he began in September, 1898, and\r\ncontinued until 1905, when he became city editor. July 7, 1903, he\r\nmarried Miss Bertha E. Lobb, of Honesdale, Pa.\r\n\r\nSHIMER, EVI--The present business manager of the Port Jervis\r\n_Gazette_ is Evi Shimer. He has held that position since April 1,\r\n1886. Mr. Shimer was born December 8, 1860, on the old Shimer\r\nhomestead in Montague, Sussex County, N. J. His parents were Abram\r\nand Adaline Cuddeback Shimer. When Evi was about seven years of age,\r\nthe family moved to Port Jervis, where he attended the public\r\nschools. Later he graduated from the Binghamton Business College.\r\nAfter that he was ten years in the wholesale hardware business in\r\nNew York City. April 1, 1886, he returned to Port Jervis and became\r\nbusiness manager of the _Gazette_ establishment, which position he\r\nstill holds. Mr. Shimer was for four years one of the trustees of the\r\nvillage of Port Jervis. In November, 1888, Mr. Shimer and Miss Susan\r\nA. Donaldson were married.\r\n\r\nBROWN, MELVIN H.--The present city editor of the Middletown\r\n_Times-Press_ is Melvin Halstead Brown, an alert worker and ready\r\nwriter. He was born at Otisville, N. Y., December 25, 1867, a son of\r\nOrville and Emeline Ketcham Brown. Melvin H. attended the public\r\nschools at Paterson, N. J., and later in Middletown and the Wallkill\r\nAcademy. He learned the printer's trade in the _Argus_ office,\r\nbeginning at the age of fifteen years. When the Middletown _Times_\r\nwas started he became a compositor thereon, later foreman of the\r\ncomposing room, and twelve years ago became a reporter, which\r\nposition, and that of city editor, he has since filled. His wife was\r\nMiss Anaina, daughter of Alderman and Mrs. George Miller.\r\n\r\nRUSSELL, ALEXANDER W.--One of the ablest editorial writers on the\r\ncountry press of to-day is the young man who is on the staff of the\r\nMiddletown _Times-Press,_ Alexander W. Russell. He is alert to\r\nevents of local as well as of State, national and international\r\nimportance, and treats them in a most able manner, in language that\r\nis choice, pleasing and expressive. Mr. Russell was born at New\r\nBerlin, Chenango County, N. Y., April 14, 1865. His parents were\r\nEdward and Elinor Tillinghast Russell. He learned the trade of a\r\nprinter in the office of the Brookfield _Courier,_ at Brookfield,\r\nMadison County, N. Y. Later, he attended Hobart College at Geneva,\r\nN. Y., leaving there in 1886, to become city editor of the Oneida\r\n_Union,_ Oneida, N. Y., which position he filled for ten years, at\r\nthe end of which time he became city editor of the Brockton, Mass.,\r\n_Gazette,_ where he remained two years. Soon after this he came to\r\nMiddletown, N. Y., where he has since remained, and has been on the\r\n_Times-Press_ editorial staff since 1906.\r\n\r\nMACARDELL, ABRAM B.--Abram Bennet Macardell, the editor of the\r\n_Argus_ and _Mercury,_ and vice-president and secretary of the\r\nArgus and Mercury Publishing Company, was born at Mount Hope, this\r\ncounty, a son of Cornelius and Esther Crawford Macardell. In January,\r\n1886, the family removed to Middletown, and he was educated in the\r\npublic schools there and graduated from Wallkill Academy in 1897, a\r\nmember of the last class to graduate from that time-honored and\r\nhistoric institution, which, after that year, became the Middletown\r\nHigh School. He entered Hamilton College and graduated in 1901. In\r\nNovember, 1902, he entered the _Argus_ office and succeeded George H.\r\nThompson as editor at his death in May, 1904. He was active in the\r\nformation of the Argus and Mercury Company in March, 1906. Mr.\r\nMacardell is an easy, graceful writer, and, while \"young in the\r\nharness,\" is doing good editorial work.\r\n\r\nSTAGE, ALBERT L.--The present city editor of the Port Jervis _Daily\r\nUnion_ is Albert Louis Stage. He was born in the town of Lumberland,\r\nSullivan County, N. Y., June 8, 1876. His parents were Albert and\r\nCaroline Cowen Stage. He attended the public schools at Barryville,\r\nN. Y., and Equinunk, Pa., qualified himself for teaching, and for\r\nseveral years was thus engaged in the public schools at Blooming\r\nGrove, Greeley, Mast Hope, and Flagstone, Pa.

Kinney, spices, coffees, teas and\r\ngroceries, in Binghamton, N. Y. In March, 1905, he became city editor\r\nof the Port Jervis _Union,_ which position he has since most\r\nacceptably filled.\r\n\r\nSTIVERS, DR. MOSES A.--Moses Asby Stivers was born in Middletown,\r\nNovember 14, 1872, the youngest son of the Hon. Moses D. and Mary\r\nElizabeth Stewart Stivers. He graduated in the Middletown schools,\r\nand became bookkeeper in the Middletown _Times_ when it was first\r\nstarted. Later he entered the College of Physicians and Surgeons in\r\nNew York City in 1894. Dr. Stivers is a practicing physician in\r\nMiddletown, is connected with Thrall Hospital, and is now secretary\r\nand treasurer of the Stivers Printing Company, of which his brother,\r\nJohn D. Stivers, is president, printing the _Daily Times-Press._ He\r\nis a young man of superior mental qualities and ever amiable and\r\ncourteous.\r\n\r\n                        CALLED ELSEWHERE.\r\n\r\nAmong the newspaper men, aside from those already mentioned, who have\r\ncome and gone--some to their final reward, others to new or different\r\nfields of labor--who were more or less important actors on this stage\r\nof life's industry, were some who were peculiarly adapted to\r\njournalistic work and had rendered highly satisfactory service in\r\ntheir day. Among such were:\r\n\r\nHOLBROOK, DANIEL--Daniel Holbrook, who, in 1862, bought the\r\n_Tri-States Union_ in Port Jervis--a college graduate, a linguist,\r\nscholar, and able writer, a native of Boston. After less than a\r\ndecade of newspaper work, he sold the plant, and has since been\r\nengaged in the real estate and insurance business in Port Jervis, and\r\nis now justice of the peace and police justice in the city of Port\r\nJervis.\r\n\r\nSLAWSON, WILLIAM G.--William G. Slawson was, in the '70's, one of the\r\nliveliest reporters that ever labored in Middletown, and he kept the\r\ncolumns of the _Press_ teeming with his clever work. He has been for\r\nseveral years in other work, lately at Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nSHIER, JAMES J.--James J. Shier, a graduate of the Middletown\r\n_Mercury and Argus,_ was city editor there some time, and in the\r\n'80's went to Port Jervis and secured an interest in the _Gazette,_\r\nwhere he remained until he died, June 2, 1893.\r\n\r\nHELLER, BURRELL--An old Milford and Port Jervis printer and a good\r\nwriter and reporter was Burrell Heller, who died late in the '80's.\r\nHe was employed in various capacities on the Port Jervis papers,\r\nlatterly as reporter on the Port Jervis _Gazette._\r\n\r\nYOUNG, CHARLES O.--Charles O. Young, of Port Jervis, admitted to the\r\nbar as a lawyer in the '80's, son of the late Oliver Young (a\r\nprominent lawyer of Port Jervis), edited the Port Jervis _Daily\r\nUnion_ several years. He is a most accomplished writer, highly\r\neducated, a scholar, a linguist, and a man of high literary tastes.\r\nHe prefers literature to law, and the Port Jervis papers are\r\noccasionally favored with emanations from his gifted pen.\r\n\r\nWILLIS, EVANDER B.--Evander B. Willis appeared in Middletown early in\r\nthe '60's, and learned the printer's trade, later becoming an expert\r\nstenographer, then reporter and editor, and for a time conducted the\r\nMiddletown _Mail._ He was born at Unionville. Early in the '70's he\r\nwent to California and became court stenographer.\r\n\r\nBENNET, JAMES--One of the men who figured prominently in the\r\nwestern end of orange County newspaper circles for about a quarter of\r\na century was James Bennet, of Port Jervis. He was a good newspaper\r\nman and had a knack for seeing the droll side of events and for\r\nputting the same into print, and some of his \"yarns\" were extremely\r\nwitty. Mr. Bennet is the youngest son of James and Sarah Westfall\r\nBennet, and he was born at Carpenter's Point (now Tri-States, and a\r\npart of the Fourth Ward of the city of Port Jervis). James Bennet\r\ngraduated at the famous old Mount Retirement Seminary in Sussex\r\nCounty, N. J., near Deckertown (now Sussex), in 1863. He studied\r\nmedicine two years, and abandoned the same to go into the flour and\r\nfeed business in Port Jervis. In 1886 he accepted a position in the\r\nbusiness and editorial department of the Port Jervis _Gazette,_ and\r\nbecame associate editor. In 1889 he went with the _Union,_ remaining\r\nthere fifteen months, and then returned to his former position with\r\nthe _Gazette,_ where he remained until 1906, when he resigned to go\r\ninto the insurance business--the retreat of so many old newspaper\r\nmen. His wife was Alice Stiles, daughter of the late Edward A.\r\nStiles, for so many useful years the principal and proprietor of the\r\nMount Retirement Seminary.\r\n\r\nBARRET, LEON--One of the brightest cartoonists of the metropolis,\r\nLeon Barret, began his work in Orange County, having come to\r\nMiddletown in the '70's, where he conducted a book and stationery\r\nstore at the corner of James and King streets. He soon developed a\r\ntalent for drawing that attracted the notice of newspaper men, and\r\nMessrs. Macardell and Thompson found a place for him on the _Argus\r\nand Mercury,_ and eventually took him into partnership. His artistic\r\nability so rapidly improved, however, as to receive recognition from\r\nthe New York press, and severing his connection with the _Argus_ he\r\nwent to the metropolis, where a wider field was afforded for the\r\nexercise of his remarkable talents, and where he has won fame and\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, WALLACE B.--Wallace B. Wheat, for the past twenty-five or\r\nthirty years, has been connected with the Port Jervis _Gazette_ as\r\ntypesetter and reporter, and for many years has been the local\r\nrepresentative of the New York _World._\r\n\r\nBENNET, JAMES EDWARD--James Edward Bennet was the son of James\r\nBennet, and for four years was a reporter for and city editor of the\r\nPort Jervis _Gazette,_ and is now a practicing lawyer in New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nPINE, COL. CHARLES N.--Col. Charles N. Pine was an old Philadelphia\r\njournalist who, in the '90's, passed his last years on the Port\r\nJervis _Gazette,_ going there from Milford. He was brainy and\r\nbrilliant. He died in Port Jervis, October 26, 1894.\r\n\r\nBAILEY, WILLIAM P.--William F. Bailey through the '90's was one of\r\nthe most alert reporters that Middletown ever had. He was a graduate\r\nof the _Press_ office, and his work was always in the lead. He is now\r\nin the insurance business in New York City.\r\n\r\nGIBBS, WHITFIELD--Whitfield Gibbs was, for a short time, in Orange\r\nCounty journalism, having been the owner of the _Walden Citizen_ late\r\nin the '90's. Mr. Gibbs now resides at Hackettstown, N. J. He is an\r\nable writer, and a good newspaper man.\r\n\r\nCRANE, STEPHEN--Stephen Crane, the gifted author of \"The Red Badge\r\nof Courage\" and other tales, and magazine and newspaper articles,\r\nbegan his literary career in Port Jervis, and did reporting a short\r\ntime on the _Daily Union._ His father was a resident of that city,\r\npastor of Drew M. E. Church, and died in that city.\r\n\r\nCOREY, HORACE W.--Though connected with journalism only briefly and\r\nthrough his interest in the Middletown _Sunday Forum_ (1897-99),\r\nHorace W. Corey gave evidence of unique ability in that work which,\r\npursued, would have brought reward and fame. His \"sermons\" and other\r\nsatires were features that \"pointed morals\" where much needed.\r\n\r\nPENDELL, THOMAS--Thomas Pendell came into Orange County through\r\nCornwall (1889) and to Middletown in 1898-99 on the _Forum;_ later on\r\nthe _Argus,_ and again on the _Forum,_ which he removed to Massena,\r\nN. Y. He is a ready writer, a rapid worker, a practical printer, and\r\none of the best all-round newspaper men that have ever tarried in\r\nOrange County. He is now publishing a paper at Peekskill.\r\n\r\nBLANCHARD, FRANK L.--Frank L. Blanchard, of New York, was connected\r\nwith the Middletown _Forum_ from December, 1907, to March or April,\r\n1908. He is a good writer.\r\n\r\n                          IN THE HARNESS.\r\n\r\nConnected with the newspapers at the present time one finds an array\r\nof rising talent, the fourth generation of workers since journalism\r\ngained a foothold in Orange County.\r\n\r\nWILSON, FREDERICK WILLIAM--In Newburgh the Newburgh _Daily News_ has\r\nas editor Frederick William Wilson. To the energy and ability of\r\nFrederick W. Wilson, editor of the Newburgh _Daily News_ and\r\npresident and treasurer of the Newburgh News Printing and Publishing\r\nCo., is due in great measure the success that newspaper has achieved\r\nas a business proposition, and also its recognized standing among the\r\nleading newspapers of the State.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson's connection with the _News_ dates almost from its\r\ninception, when as a lad in his teens he entered the business office\r\nof the paper in its second year of publication as bookkeeper. The\r\nfounder of the _News,_ the late William H. Keefe, was not slow to\r\nrecognize the aptitude of the young man for the business, and in his\r\ntwentieth year he practically had the entire business management of\r\nthe then very modest _News_ establishment in his hands, Mr. Keefe\r\nconfining himself principally to the editorial conduct of the young\r\nand rapidly growing paper.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was born October 8, 1869, near Brighton, the renowned\r\nwatering-place in the south of England. His father, Henry Wilson, was\r\na surgeon in the British navy and saw service in the Crimean War. He\r\ndied when the subject of this biography was but ten years old. After\r\nhis death his widow, Sarah Jane Cleaver, daughter of a prominent\r\nwoolen goods manufacturer and former mayor of Northampton, came to\r\nNewburgh, where an older son, Dr. Henry Wilson, was established in\r\nthe practice of medicine. Other relatives lived in New York and the\r\nNew England States. She died here in 1894, leaving, besides the two\r\nsons mentioned, two daughters, Kathryn and Maude, both of whom are\r\nmarried and live in New York City.\r\n\r\nYoung Wilson evinced an early aptitude for literary work, and having\r\ncompleted his education, frequently contributed to the _News,_ which\r\nabout that time was started by its founder.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 a company was organized to conduct the _News._ Mr. Wilson was\r\none of the incorporators and directors, and at the meeting of the\r\nboard of directors was chosen secretary and treasurer. Mr. Keefe was\r\nelected president. On the latter's death, in 1901, Mr. Wilson\r\nsucceeded to the presidency of the company. He immediately set on\r\nfoot plans for the enlargement of the paper and the betterment of its\r\nmechanical equipment. One of these was the introduction of\r\ntypesetting machines. Next the large double brick building, Nos. 40\r\nand 42 Grand street, was purchased and remodeled into an up-to-date\r\nnewspaper and printing plant at an outlay for alterations alone\r\nexceeding $15,000. A perfecting press (the first in the city) was\r\ninstalled therein, and the building was equipped with every known\r\ncontrivance to facilitate the work of production of a modern\r\nnewspaper. The plant and equipment to-day represent an investment of\r\nover $100,000, and the home of the _News_ is regarded as one of the\r\nmost complete and handsome newspaper establishments in the State.\r\nSimultaneously with the removal of the _News_ to its new home (in the\r\nspring of 1902), Mr. Wilson changed the appearance of the paper by\r\ndiscarding the old-fashioned nine-column \"blanket\" sheet for the\r\nmodern seven-column folio form--an innovation at that time for small\r\ncity dailies, but now generally in vogue. The history of the paper\r\nunder his direction has been one of evolution, progress and marked\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBesides being a fluent and forceful writer, Mr. Wilson possesses rare\r\nbusiness tact and executive ability--a combination seldom found in\r\nnewspaper men.\r\n\r\nHe is a moving spirit in all that makes for the welfare and growth of\r\nNewburgh and is an earnest advocate both through his paper and\r\norally, of progress and enterprise in municipal matters. He is\r\nactively identified with the work of the Business Men's Association\r\nfor a \"greater Newburgh,\" and is the chairman of the committee which\r\nhas in hand the arrangements for Newburgh's part in the celebration\r\nof the tercentenary of the discovery of the Hudson River and the\r\ncentennial of the navigation of its waters by Robert Fulton's\r\nClermont, to be held in September, 1909.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson early displayed a liking for politics, his first\r\ninclination in that direction finding vent in the organization of a\r\njuvenile \"Tippecanoe Club,\" which participated in the local parades\r\nof the Harrison campaign of 1888. Later he took part in the\r\norganization of a club of young voters known as the Union League\r\nClub. The one hundred and fifty members unanimously elected him\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nHe has always been an admirer and earnest supporter of former\r\nGovernor Odell. He was a delegate to the State convention at Saratoga\r\nin 1900, when Mr. Odell was first nominated for the governorship, and\r\nagain in 1902, when he was renominated. He was also a delegate to the\r\nconvention of 1904, which nominated Higgins, and to that of 1906,\r\nwhen Governor Hughes was nominated. He has himself never desired or\r\nheld public office, but has been a factor in putting many of his\r\nfriends in elective and appointive positions of trust.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson enlisted in the Tenth Separate Company at the age of\r\neighteen and served six years. He volunteered to return to the ranks\r\nat the outbreak of the Spanish-American War and was offered a\r\ncommission, but the company was not ordered to the front.\r\n\r\nHe is active in social as well as business life, being a member of\r\nthe Powelton Club, City Club and Newburgh Wheelmen, the Old Orchard\r\nClub of Middletown, and the Press Club and Republican Club of New\r\nYork. He is a past exalted ruler of Newburgh Lodge of Elks; a member\r\nof Continental Lodge No. 287, F. and A. M.; Jerusalem Chapter No. 8,\r\nR. A. M.; Palestine Commandery No. 18, K. T.; New York Consistory,\r\nScottish Rite, 32nd deg; Mecca Temple, Nobles of the Mystic Shrine;\r\npresident of the Wilbur H. Weston Shriners' Association; president of\r\nthe Newburgh Automobile Club, and a member of the New York State and\r\nAmerican Automobile Associations.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson resides in a handsome residence owned by him at 268\r\nLiberty street, Newburgh.\r\n\r\nRUTTENBER, J. W. F.--The editor of the Newburgh _Telegram_ is\r\nJ. W. F. Ruttenber, who was born at Newburgh, N. Y., December 14,\r\n1857. After receiving a good education in the public schools of his\r\nnative city, he became associated in business for several years with\r\nhis father, E. M. Ruttenber. Subsequently he embarked in several\r\nnewspaper ventures, and finally started the Newburgh _Sunday\r\nTelegram_ in 1889. This is a non-partisan paper, and is especially\r\ndevoted to local events and local characters, in the discussion of\r\nwhich a full opportunity is afforded the editor for the exercise of\r\nthat wit and caustic humor, with which he is well equipped. The\r\n_Telegram_ was a success financially from the start and has now\r\ndeveloped into a very valuable newspaper plant.\r\n\r\nIn Middletown the _Times-Press_ has as editor John D. Stivers; as\r\neditorial writer Alexander W. Russell, and as city editor Melvin\r\nW. Brown. On the _Argus_ the editor is A. B. Macardell, ably assisted\r\nby Henry P. Powers and Horace A. MacGowan as city editors. The _Signs\r\nof the Times_ is published by Gilbert Beebe's Son, with Elders F. A.\r\nChick and H. C. Ker as editors.\r\n\r\nOn the Port Jervis _Union_ is Fred R. Salmon, business manager;\r\nMerritt C. Speidel, assistant and formerly city editor; W. T. Doty\r\nas editor, and Albert L. Stage, city editor. On the _Gazette_ is Evi\r\nShimer, business manager; William H. Nearpass, editor; Mark V.\r\nRichards, city editor, and James Skellinger, assistant. The _New York\r\nFarmer_ is edited by Henry A. Van Fredenberg.\r\n\r\nIn Goshen Frank Drake is editor and manager of the oldest newspaper\r\nin Orange County, the _Independent Republican;_ and George F. Gregg,\r\nthe editor and manager of the next oldest paper, the _Goshen\r\nDemocrat._\r\n\r\nAt Warwick the _Advertiser's_ business manager and editor is Hiram\r\nTate; while the _Valley Dispatch_ has George F. Ketchum as editor and\r\nbusiness manager.\r\n\r\nAt Montgomery the old _Standard and Reporter_ has Lyman Taft as\r\neditor and proprietor, with Charles H. Miller as associate editor.\r\n\r\nThe _Walden Herald's_ editor and proprietor is Ward Winfield; and the\r\n_Citizen_ has a clergyman editor and publisher in the Rev. J. H.\r\nReid.\r\n\r\nAt Cornwall-on-Hudson is the _Local-Press,_ with L. G. Goodenough\r\neditor and proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe _Pine Bush Herald's_ editor and proprietor is George W. Jamison,\r\na former school teacher and an educated man and good writer.\r\n\r\nMonroe has the _Ramapo Valley Gazette_ (started March, 1908), with\r\nJ. B. Gregory as publisher and proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe _Orange County Record_ at Washingtonville has Montanye Rightmyer\r\nas editor and manager.\r\n\r\n                     JUST A FEW REFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nInspecting the field of Orange County journalism one sees the Glebe\r\nstrewn with wrecks of ambitious effort, and sympathy goes out to the\r\ndisappointed strugglers, they of tattered aims and ambitions; of\r\nimmolated hopes and desires.\r\n\r\nLooking at the files and samples of the papers of to-day and the\r\nrelics of early journalism in Orange County, one's pride over\r\nprogress in certain lines is mixed with humiliation. The old papers\r\nwere printed with artistic ideals. The type was neat, the page was\r\npleasing to the eye, and the printer showed evidence of intelligence.\r\nWords were divided at the ends of lines with some idea of method and\r\nreason; the break-lines were made neat. The old-time compositor who\r\nwould have divided \"campaign\" on the \"p\" and run \"aign\" over, or\r\nworse yet, made a break-line of \"ed,\" \"ly,\" or a single or even two\r\nnumerals, would have been laughed out of the office by his\r\ncompanions. The writer will never forget an incident in his own very\r\nearly career at the \"case,\" when he divided \"Messrs,\" running the\r\n\"srs.\" over into the next line. It was a long time before he heard\r\nthe last of that break, and it was never repeated. To-day one sees\r\nall sorts of divisions--anywhere, everywhere; it matters not whether\r\nit is on the vowel or the syllable or between--it all goes. The\r\noutrage on neatness of a single numeral making a full break-line is\r\nno longer confined to the \"blacksmith\" who was aiming to gel a \"phat\r\nline,\" but is seen in the work turned out from the marvelous\r\nMergenthaler Linotype, the excuse being that it \"takes too much time\"\r\nto space and adjust the line neatly. This same excuse is given for a\r\nlot of other abominations--really intolerable and vexatious--that one\r\nsees in the machine-set newspaper. Really, if modern mechanical\r\nappliances are sweeping the \"art preservative\" back to the most crude\r\nand primitive specimens of workmanship, there is cause for deep\r\nregret. Neatness should go hand in hand with improved methods and\r\naids.\r\n\r\nThe old-time newspaper was not a hand-bill. It was a model of taste\r\nand neatness. The idea of the average editor, publisher and printer\r\ntoday seems to be how he can make his paper the most hideous to the\r\neye, and to the aesthetic senses. Big, black type for headlines, and\r\nglaring, sensational, spectacular, flaring \"big heads\" are the order\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nCompare these modern newspapers with almost any of those printed one\r\nhundred, fifty, forty, thirty years ago. The contrast is so markedly\r\nin favor of the papers printed under the old regime that one who\r\nreally loves the art is disgusted with modern printers and printing\r\nas applied to newspapers.\r\n\r\nThis criticism, it should be borne in mind, is made with reference to\r\nnewspapers, and not of \"job work.\" The man who is getting out\r\nbill-heads, letter-heads, etc., is constantly striving for neatness,\r\nand his work is a great advance over that done by his predecessors in\r\nthe \"job department.\" This is as it should be.\r\n\r\nThe modern job printer is an artist; the modern newspaper printer a\r\nbotch. The printer may blame the editor or publisher, but that does\r\nnot excuse his vile distortions and caricatures on the art. The\r\npublisher or editor may blame the \"popular demand\" for his efforts to\r\ncater to the sensational and hideous; but that does not help the\r\nmatter any, nor does it tend to elevate the art of newspaper\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nJournalism, indeed, seems to have fallen, or wandered, into dangerous\r\nor demoralizing ways. This, also, is laid at the door of \"popular\r\ndemand,\" etc. The old-time editor had a personality, and this he\r\ninfused into the columns of his paper. He was not always right, of\r\ncourse, but the general tendency of such journalism was to breed a\r\nspirit of independence, of character, of research. The consensus thus\r\nevolved by the masses was wholesome.\r\n\r\nTo-day the editor is a mere machine. His individuality is suppressed,\r\nand the effort is to keep him entirely under the thumb and rack-screw\r\nof the publisher, who manipulates the finances, the \"business\" end of\r\nthe concern. This publisher generally gets his \"cue\" from his banker,\r\nwho may be his backer, and, who, at any rate, sets the pace for\r\neditorials, news--and in fact the whole tone of the paper. In all\r\nthis there is concert. From some great business center the word goes\r\nout, and the newspapers catch up the echo. In this way the\r\nindividual, the great personality that once made the newspaper a\r\npower for good, is lost; instead, the press has become a mob--the\r\nmost dangerous mob that ever existed, for it comes in the guise of\r\ninstruction, of morals, of culture, of learning. Thus masquerading,\r\njournalism to-day is fast lapsing--or rather plunging--into a vortex\r\nthat is positively appalling in its aspects. How and when the remedy\r\nwill come is of grave concern. The mob may, in sheer desperation,\r\nrend itself, commit hari-kari; or it may go on until in frenzy, the\r\nlong-deluded and outraged populace shall rise and revolutionize\r\nnewspaperdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nFREEMASONRY.\r\n\r\nBy Charles H. Halstead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest authentic record of masonry in New York, or in fact in\r\nthe American colonies, is the deputation appointing Daniel Coxe, of\r\nNew Jersey, to be provincial grand master of New York, New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania, signed by the Duke of Norfolk, grand master of the\r\ngrand lodge of England, and dated \"this fifth day of June, 1730, and\r\nof Masonry 5730.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that date and until 1781 there were five different masonic\r\ndeputations granted to provincial grand masters for New York, by the\r\ngrand lodge of England.\r\n\r\nDuring this period there were two provincial grand lodges in the\r\nState of New York, organized at different periods by authority of\r\nrival grand lodges in England, which were termed the \"Moderns\" and\r\n\"Ancients.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1813 these two grand bodies united into what is now the \"United\r\nGrand Lodge of England.\"\r\n\r\nThe provincial grand lodge authorized by the Atholl warrant, dated\r\nSeptember 5, 1781, existed from December 5, 1782, to September 19,\r\n1783. when the British troops evacuated New York City, and as the\r\ngrand lodge was essentially a royalist institution, and a majority of\r\nits officers and members were connected with the evacuating army, the\r\nbrethren were in a quandary, the solution of which we find in the\r\nminutes of a grand lodge of emergency, held on the nineteenth of\r\nSeptember, 1783, when \"The propriety of leaving the grand warrant by\r\nwhich this lodge is established in the province of New York, being\r\nfully discussed, it was resolved, that the same should be left and\r\nremain in the care of such brethren as may hereafter be appointed to\r\nsucceed the present grand officers, the most of whom being under the\r\nnecessity of leaving New York upon the removal of his majesty's\r\ntroops.\"\r\n\r\nThis necessitated the election of a complete new set of officers,\r\nwhich was immediately done.\r\n\r\nThe lodges throughout the State, which had received charters from the\r\n\"Modern\" provincial grand lodge, in the interim between the\r\ndissolution of that body and the organization of the \"Ancient\"\r\nProvincial grand lodge had pursued an independent existence and\r\nnaturally under their existing conditions, were loath to surrender\r\ntheir warrants to the new body; therefore, it was a number of years\r\nbefore all the lodges were brought under the control of the new\r\ngrand lodge.\r\n\r\nThis provincial grand lodge, so far as existing records show, made no\r\nreturns to the parent grand body, and in all matters acted as an\r\nindependent grand lodge.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs caused some of the lodges to question the\r\nlegality of its proceedings, and the propriety of paying grand lodge\r\ndues.\r\n\r\nThis question was settled for all time on the sixth of June, 1787, by\r\nthe grand lodge adopting the report of a committee which reported:\r\n\"Your committee appointed at the last quarterly communication, in\r\nconsequence of certain resolutions of St. John's lodge, respecting\r\nthe warrant under which the grand lodge is established, report their\r\nopinion as follows, viz.: That the grand lodge of this State is\r\nestablished, according to ancient and universal usages of masonry,\r\nupon a constitution formed by the representatives of the regular\r\nlodges, convened under a legal warrant from the grand lodge of\r\nEngland, dated the fifth day of September, in the year of masonry\r\nfive thousand seven hundred and eighty-one, the most noble Prince\r\nJohn the Third, Duke of Atholl, being the then grand master, and your\r\ncommittee further beg leave to report that, in their opinion, nothing\r\nis necessary or essential in the future proceedings of the grand\r\nlodge upon the subject matter referred to them, but that a committee\r\nbe appointed to prepare a draft of the style of warrant to be\r\nhereafter granted by the grand lodge, conformable to the said\r\nconstitution. All of which is, nevertheless, most respectfully\r\nsubmitted to the wisdom of the most worshipful grand lodge.\" In this\r\nmanner the grand lodge declared itself an independent grand body,\r\nsupreme within its own jurisdiction. The date of transition of the\r\ngrand lodge from a provincial to an independent State masonic\r\norganization might be a subject of difference of opinion, but the\r\ngrand lodge, however, numbers its annual communications from the\r\nearlier date, viz., 1781, under the charter issued by the \"Ancients.\"\r\n\r\nThe grand lodge of the State of New York, under this charter,\r\nguarantees certain rights and privileges to 775 masonic lodges having\r\na membership (December 31, 1906), of 146,026 master masons.\r\n\r\nAt different times the grand lodge has been disrupted by internal\r\nstrife and schisms which continued several years, but since June,\r\n1858, peace and harmony have prevailed among the fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe severest trial that freemasonry has had to endure was the\r\nanti-masonic crusade that began in 1826, which assailed the\r\nfraternity throughout the land and resulted in many of the lodges\r\nhaving their charters forfeited.\r\n\r\nA political party was founded at the time on prejudice and hatred.\r\nPoliticians mounted the whirlwind, and rode into power on the storm.\r\nFanatics in the forum, at the bar and in the pulpit inflamed the\r\npassions of men and aroused the bitterest enmity against freemasonry.\r\nMen of the highest social and masonic standing were threatened with\r\npolitical ostracism; to be a mason was to be an object of suspicion\r\nand often of persecution; the lodge rooms were deserted, charters\r\nwere surrendered, and the craft became disheartened at the situation.\r\nSome members of the fraternity openly declared their withdrawal and\r\nwere known as \"seceding masons\" in the community. After ten years of\r\nbitter feeling and hatred against the society of Free and Accepted\r\nMasons, the storm of persecution began to subside; the calmer and\r\nbetter judgment of men prevailed; the craft took courage and masonic\r\nlodges again opened their doors and resumed labor. In 1840 there was\r\nnot a masonic lodge in Orange County.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the meager information given in the proceedings\r\nof grand lodge or in the minutes of subordinate lodges in the early\r\ndays that the brethren were imbued with the idea that the very\r\nexistence of the fraternity depended upon shrouding with great\r\nsecrecy their every act and surroundings, consequently very few\r\ndetails can be gathered concerning matters that would make history.\r\n\r\n_Steuben Lodge, No. 18._--The first mention of a masonic lodge in\r\nOrange County is found in the proceedings of grand lodge on the\r\nfourth of June, 1788, where we find this minute: \"A petition from\r\nF. A. Morris and nine others praying for a warrant to hold a lodge at\r\nNewburgh, under the name of Steuben. Granted.\"\r\n\r\nThe charter was issued to Ebenezer Foote, master; Francis Anderson\r\nMorris, senior warden, and Peter Nestell, junior warden, and was\r\ndated September 27, 1788. It was signed by Robert R. Livingston,\r\ngrand master; Richard Harrison, deputy grand master, and Jacob\r\nMorton, grand secretary. Baron de Steuben was an honorary member of\r\nthe lodge. The minutes embrace the period between the thirteenth of\r\nNovember, 1788, and the twenty-seventh of December, 1792. Doubtless\r\nthe charter was surrendered soon after 1800, as at the communication\r\nof grand lodge of that year report was made of the irregularities\r\nthat prevailed in Steuben lodge. This lodge is among the number whose\r\ncharter cannot be revived by resolution of grand lodge.\r\n\r\nThe charter and minute book of Steuben Lodge, No. 18, are in the\r\nkeeping of Hudson River Lodge, No. 607, as custodian.\r\n\r\n_St. John's Lodge, No. 21._--Subsequent to the disbandment of the\r\ntroops in the war of the Revolution the warrant of St. John's\r\nregimental lodge--the first military lodge warranted by New York or\r\nany provincial masonic power--was taken by some of its members to\r\nClark's Town, in the county of Orange, and here it remained until\r\ninterest was revived in masonry by some of its officers in 1784, who\r\ncame at that time under the jurisdiction of the grand lodge.\r\n\r\nLodge meetings were held under this warrant at Warwick as well as at\r\nClark's Town, when on the twenty-third of December, 1789, a petition\r\nsigned by John Smith, David Miller and Thomas Wing, was made to grand\r\nlodge stating that they were the presiding officers of a lodge now\r\nheld at Warwick, working under an old warrant and known by the name\r\nof St. John's Lodge, and formerly held at Clark's Town, and praying\r\nthat, as the warrant properly belonged to the brethren at Clark's\r\nTown, \"a new warrant be issued to them as officers of a lodge to be\r\nheld in the county of Orange, on the west side of the mountain, by\r\nthe name of St. John's Lodge.\" The petition was granted and the\r\nwarrant dated the twenty-sixth March, 1790. On December 4, 1793, the\r\nproxy of St. John's Lodge stated to grand lodge the low condition of\r\nthe funds and offered as a compromise for the amount due the grand\r\nlodge the sum of 10 pounds, which was accepted.\r\n\r\nThe lodge was represented by proxy in grand lodge as late as 1802,\r\nbut does not appear thereafter until June 4, 1819, when \"the\r\nnumerical designation of St. John's Lodge, No. 19, held at Warwick,\r\nwas changed to No. 18.\" On June 12, 1822, \"all lodges in arrears for\r\ndues for three years and upwards were summoned to show cause why\r\ntheir warrants should not be surrendered,\" and among the number was\r\nSt. John's, No. 18. The charter was declared forfeited on the eighth\r\nof June, 1832, by grand lodge.\r\n\r\n_Orange Lodge, No. 45._--At a meeting of grand lodge held on the\r\nsecond of March, 1796, petitions for warrants were read and among the\r\nnumber was one \"for a lodge to be held in the town of Goshen, by the\r\nname of Orange Lodge.\" The warrant was dated April 12, 1796.\r\n\r\nThe lodge was represented by proxy in the grand lodge at the\r\ncommunication of January 2, 1799, but thereafter we find no mention\r\nof it except in the \"list of lodges whose charters cannot be revived\r\nconformable to resolution of grand lodge adopted on the fourth of\r\nJune, 1819.\"\r\n\r\n_James' Lodge, No. 65._ On the 6th of September, 1797, a petition was\r\npresented to grand lodge \"From Adam I. Doll and others, to hold a\r\nlodge in the town of Middletown, county of Ulster, by the name of\r\nJames' Lodge, and the same was referred to the grand officers.\" At\r\nthat time Middletown was embraced in the county of Ulster. The\r\nwarrant was dated January 6th, 1798, No other information is\r\nobtainable concerning this lodge, but it appears as one of the\r\nlodges whose charters cannot be revived.\r\n\r\n_Montgomery Lodge, No. 71._ The minutes of grand lodge of December\r\n7th, 1796, read: \"The petition of Brother John Schmidt and sundry\r\nother brethren, for a warrant to erect and hold a lodge in the town\r\nof Montgomery, county of Ulster, with some accompanying papers, were\r\nthen severally read, and referred to the presiding officers of the\r\ngrand lodge, with powers to order a warrant to be issued if they find\r\nthe applicants deserving.\" The warrant was not issued, however, until\r\nthe 6th of June, 1798, when the dispensation was returned to grand\r\nlodge. The lodge was represented by proxy in grand lodge up to the\r\n4th of March, 1812. The warrant was doubtless forfeited some years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n_Olive Branch Lodge, No. 102._ At the communication of grand lodge,\r\nheld on the 7th of December, 1803, we find this minute: \"A similar\r\npetition from sundry brethren residing in the town of Minisink,\r\nOrange County, praying a warrant for a lodge to be held in said town,\r\nto be known by the name of Olive Branch Lodge, was read and referred\r\nto the grand officers.\" The lodge was located in the village of West\r\nTown, and its meetings were held on the upper floor of the academy\r\nbuilding. On December 4th, 1811, \"Olive Branch Lodge, No. 102, prayed\r\nthat the payment of their dues (to grand lodge) might be postponed\r\nuntil the next year on account of several losses sustained by the\r\nlodge the present year, which was granted.\" The lodge was reported as\r\nbeing in arrears for dues for two years and upwards in 1822. The\r\ncharter was declared forfeited, June 8, 1832.\r\n\r\n_Hiram Lodge, No. 131._ At the communication of grand lodge, held on\r\nthe 19th of February, 1806, \"A petition from sundry brethren to\r\nestablish a lodge at Newburgh, by the name of Hiram Lodge, was read\r\nand the prayer thereof granted.\" The first officers of the lodge\r\nnamed in the charter were Jonathan Fisk, master; Charles Baker,\r\nsenior warden; John R. Drake, junior warden.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lafayette was the guest of Hiram Lodge on the occasion of his\r\nvisit to Newburgh on the 14th of September, 1824.\r\n\r\nThe charter was surrendered to grand lodge in 1835.\r\n\r\nThe anti-masonic furor having subsided, the brethren sought to reopen\r\nthe lodge, and to that end presented a petition to grand lodge that\r\nthe charter might be restored to them, which was granted in June,\r\n1842, but the number of the lodge was changed to 92. The first\r\nofficers under the revived charter were Peter F. Hunn, master; Minard\r\nHarris, senior warden; James Belknap, junior warden. The last record\r\nof the lodge is dated June 16. 1845, and we infer that the charter\r\nwas soon thereafter surrendered to grand lodge. The charter of Hiram\r\nLodge is now in the keeping of Hudson River Lodge, No. 607, as\r\ncustodian.\r\n\r\n_Mount Moriah Lodge, No. 180._ A petition was presented to grand\r\nlodge to establish: \"A lodge in the town of Wallkill, its meetings to\r\nbe holden at the house of Thomas Everson or others in the said town\r\nof Wallkill.\" A charter was granted under date of December 9th, 1809.\r\nDoubtless the lodge was held for some years in private dwellings as\r\non the 2nd of December, 1812, at the communication of grand lodge: \"A\r\npetition from Mount Moriah Lodge, No. 189, held at Wallkill, Orange\r\nCounty, praying for a remission of dues in consideration of its\r\nhaving built a commodious lodge room, for the expenses of which it\r\nwas still in arrears, was presented and read, and the prayer of the\r\npetitioner refused.\" Doubtless the lodge at that time was held in the\r\nupper room of the school building in the village of Mount Hope, as at\r\na later date masonic emblems, carved in wood, were to be seen in the\r\nroom then used for school purposes.\r\n\r\nReturns were made to grand lodge as from Wallkill, and also, \"Return\r\nof Mount Moriah Lodge, No. 189, held at Mount Hope, Wallkill, county\r\nof Orange, and State of New York.\" The charter of this lodge was\r\ndeclared forfeited on the 4th of June, 1835.\r\n\r\n_Corner-Stone Lodge, No. 231._ At the communication of grand lodge,\r\nheld on the 2d of March, 1812, \"A petition for a warrant to hold a\r\nlodge in the town of Monroe, in the county of Orange, to be called\r\nCornerstone Lodge; recommended by Washington Lodge, No. 220, was read\r\nand granted.\" The warrant was dated May 26, 1814. This lodge is\r\namong the number in arrears for dues for two years and upwards on the\r\n24th of June, 1822. The charter was declared forfeited on the 24th of\r\nJune, 1832.\r\n\r\n_Jerusalem Temple Lodge, No. 247._ At the communication of grand\r\nlodge, held on the 6th of September, 1815: \"A petition from a number\r\nof the brethren to hold a lodge in the town of Cornwall, in the\r\ncounty of Orange, to be called Jerusalem Temple Lodge; recommended by\r\nHiram Lodge, No. 131, was read and granted.\"\r\n\r\nThe lodge was constituted at the house of Ebenezer Crissey, in the\r\nvillage of Canterbury on the 5th of October of the same year; James\r\nB. Reynolds, master of Hiram Lodge, No. 131, performed the ceremony.\r\nThe first officers named in the charter were Wyatt Carr, master;\r\nAbraham Mead, senior warden; Southerland Moore, junior warden. The\r\ncharter was declared forfeited June 8th, 1832.\r\n\r\n_Washington Lodge, No. 220._ This lodge was located at Blooming Grove.\r\nThe charter was dated June 10th, 1813. No record of its work is\r\nextant, but it was one of those lodges that went down in the\r\nanti-masonic period, and its charter was declared forfeited by grand\r\nlodge on the 5th of June, 1834.\r\n\r\n_Lawrence Lodge, No. 230._ On the 1st of December, 1812, the\r\nproceedings of grand lodge read: \"A petition for a warrant to hold a\r\nlodge at Ward's Bridge, in the county of Orange, to be called\r\nLawrence Lodge, recommended by Hiram Lodge, No. 131,\" was read and\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nWard's Bridge was afterwards known as Montgomery. The lodge was\r\ndoubtless named in honor of the gallant Captain James Lawrence, who,\r\nbeing mortally wounded in the engagement with the _Shannon,_ uttered:\r\n\"Don't give up the ship!\" which have become household words in this\r\ncountry. The lodge was reported as inoperative on the 4th of June,\r\n1819.\r\n\r\n_Hoffman Lodge, No. 300._ At the communication of grand lodge on the\r\n4th of March, 1818, the grand secretary stated that a warrant had\r\nbeen issued \"on the 3d of December, 1817, to John Kirby, Stacey\r\nBeecher and Isaac Otis, to hold a lodge at Wallkill, in the county of\r\nOrange, by the name of Hoffman Lodge, No. 300.\" The lodge held its\r\nmeetings in the house of Isaac Otis, at Mechanicstown, which at that\r\ntime was a more pretentious place than Middletown. The lodge was\r\nnamed in honor of Martin Hoffman who was grand master of the (city)\r\ngrand lodge during 1823, 1824 and 1825. He presented the lodge with a\r\ncopy of the Holy Bible which is still in use by Hoffman Lodge, No.\r\n412. The charter of this lodge was declared forfeited by grand lodge\r\non the 7th of June. 1833.\r\n\r\n_Union Lodge, No. 309._ The minutes of grand lodge under date of July\r\n9, 1828, read: \"A dispensation granted by the Rt. Worshipful Richard\r\nHatfield, late D. G. M., to hold a lodge in the town of Montgomery,\r\ncounty of Orange, by the name and style of Union Lodge, recommended\r\nby Hiram Lodge, No. 131, at Newburgh, was presented, whereupon the\r\ngrand secretary was ordered to issue a warrant appointing William\r\nWilliamson, the first master, Daniel Cozens, the first senior warden\r\nand Samuel Bookstaver, the first junior warden.\"\r\n\r\nIt is rather remarkable that in the midst of the anti-masonic\r\nexcitement a new masonic lodge should have been established in that\r\nlocality, but it did not long continue, as we note that the charter\r\nwas declared forfeited on the 4th of June, 1835.\r\n\r\n_Mount William Lodge, No. 762._ A charter was granted by grand lodge\r\non the 4th of June, 1875. to hold a lodge at Port Jervis, to be known\r\nas Mount William Lodge, No. 762. From the report of the district\r\ndeputy we find that the reason given for surrendering the charter was\r\nthat the numerous societies in that village was a hindrance to\r\nincreasing its membership. The warrant was surrendered to grand lodge\r\non the 20th of June, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe lodges above enumerated have all ceased to exist, and their\r\nrecords, with few exceptions, have been lost. In some instances the\r\ncharters have been given to lodges that have since been organized in\r\nthe same locality and they are prized for the association connected\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth masonic district, as now formed, embraces the counties\r\nof Orange and Rockland, and contains sixteen masonic lodges within\r\nits jurisdiction. The county of Orange has ten masonic lodges within\r\nits borders, and it is with these we now have to do.\r\n\r\n_Newburgh Lodge, No. 309._--This lodge is located at Newburgh. The\r\ncharter is dated June 11th, 1853, and was issued to John Gray,\r\nmaster; Andrew Lawson, senior warden, and Henry O. Heustis, junior\r\nwarden. The lodge held its communications in a building situated on\r\nthe southwest corner of Front and Third streets, known as Crawford's\r\nHall, from the 28th of July, 1853, at which date the hall was\r\ndedicated to masonic purposes. Here it continued until the 24th of\r\nJune, 1863, when it was moved to the new building erected on the\r\nnorthwest corner of Colden street and Western avenue--afterwards\r\nknown as Broadway. In this hall all the masonic bodies in Newburgh\r\nmet for the succeeding twenty-five years. These quarters becoming\r\ninadequate for the membership, a lease of the two upper floors in the\r\nnew Academy of Music, situated on the northwest corner of Broadway\r\nand Grand street, was secured. This hall was dedicated on the 11th of\r\nSeptember, 1888. The membership of Newburgh Lodge on the 1st of June,\r\n1907, was 370 master masons. The officers were Charles B.

Strudwik, secretary.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the grand chapter of Royal Arch Masons in the\r\nState of New York is so obscure that but little information\r\nconcerning its subordinates is obtainable.\r\n\r\nIt is a well established fact, however, that the Royal Arch degree\r\nwas conferred in the State of New York under lodge charters prior to\r\nthe formation of the grand chapter of New York in 1798. On the 14th\r\nof March, 1798, five chapters organized and established a deputy\r\ngrand chapter subordinate to the grand chapter of the Northern\r\nStates for the State of New York.\r\n\r\nCompanion DeWitt Clinton was elected deputy grand high priest. The\r\nprefix \"deputy\" was dropped in 1799, and thereafter they were\r\ndesignated \"grand chapters.\" At one period mark lodges were a\r\ndistinct organization yet subject to, and received authority from,\r\nthe grand chapter. The degree of mark master is now conferred in a\r\nchapter of Royal Arch Masons, and the charters of mark lodges in this\r\nState have been surrendered to the grand chapter. But two mark lodges\r\nare known to have been organized in the county of Orange.\r\n\r\n_Orange Mark Lodge, No. 57._--This lodge was located at Goshen. A\r\ncharter was granted on the 8th of February, 1809, to William Elliott,\r\nWilliam A. Thompson and Edward Ely.\r\n\r\n_Hiram Mark Lodge, No. 7._--This lodge was located at Newburgh. A\r\ncharter was granted on the 3d of February, 1813, to Sylvanus Jessup,\r\nJames Williams, and George Gordon.\r\n\r\n_Orange Chapter, No. 33._--This chapter of Royal Arch Masons was\r\nlocated at Minisink. A charter was granted on the 6th of February,\r\n1812, to Uriah Hulse, James D. Wadsworth and Malcomb Campbell.\r\n\r\n_Jerusalem Temple Chapter, No. 52._--At the annual convocation of\r\ngrand chapter, held on the 6th of February, 1817, a charter was\r\ngranted: \"To Comps. James Reynolds, William Ross and William P. Lott,\r\nto hold a chapter at Newburgh, county of Orange, by the name of\r\nJerusalem Temple Chapter, No. 52.\" The last written record of a\r\nconvocation is dated May 1st, 1828. The seal, record book and ledger\r\nof Jerusalem Temple Chapter are now in possession of Highland\r\nChapter, No. 52, Newburgh, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe charters of these organizations have either been surrendered or\r\nforfeited, as they are no longer in existence.\r\n\r\nThere are but three chapters of Royal Arch Masons at present located\r\nin Orange County.\r\n\r\n_Highland Chapter, No. 52._--This chapter is located at Newburgh. At\r\nthe annual convocation of grand chapter held on the 3d of February,\r\n1864, \"A warrant was granted to Comp. John P. Stanbrough, high\r\npriest; Comp. Joseph H. H. Chapman, king; Comp. George C. Pennell,\r\nscribe, and others, to hold a chapter at Newburgh, to be known as\r\nHighland Chapter, No. 52.\" In the application for a warrant the\r\nrequest was made that the old number affixed to Jerusalem Temple\r\nChapter, \"52,\" be assigned to the new chapter, and the request was\r\ngranted. The membership of Highland Chapter on the 1st of June, 1907,\r\nwas 340 Royal Arch Masons. The officers were James D. McGiffert, high\r\npriest; William  D. Traphagen, king; John T. Swann, scribe: Charles\r\nH. Halstead, secretary.\r\n\r\n_Neversink Chapter. No. 186._--This chapter is located at Port\r\nJervis. The officers named in the charter, dated February 8th, 1865,\r\nwere Philip Lee, high priest; Charles W. Douglas, king; Lewis L.\r\nAdams, scribe.

Finn, scribe; John A. Wallace, secretary.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the Templar Order in New York is involved in\r\ngreat obscurity; yet there were several bodies, having no authority\r\nwhatever, which were organized at an early date. The grand encampment\r\n(commandery) of New York was formed on the 22d of January, 1814, by\r\nthe sovereign grand consistory, which decreed the establishment of\r\nthe grand encampment of Sir Knights Templars and appendant orders for\r\nthe State of New York, and immediately proceeded to elect officers\r\nwho were all members of said consistory. In 1816 a warrant was\r\ngranted to Columbia Commandery in New York City; and a warrant on the\r\nsame day was issued to a new commandery in New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe numerous encampments of Knights Templar existing in the State at\r\nthat time were self-created bodies, governed by their own private\r\nlaws, acknowledging no superior authority, because, in fact, none\r\nheretofore existed.\r\n\r\nThe grand encampment of New York by its representatives assisted in\r\nforming the general grand encampment of the United States of America\r\non the 11th of December, 1820.\r\n\r\nThere are but three commanderies of Knights Templar in the county of\r\nOrange.\r\n\r\n_Hudson River Commandery, No. 35._--This commandery is located at\r\nNewburgh. The charter is dated September 27, 1865, and was issued to\r\nHugh McCutcheon, eminent commander; Lendon S. Straw, generalissimo;\r\nIsaac C. Chapman, captain general. The membership on the 1st of June,\r\n1907, was 295 sir knights. The officers were Samuel F. Brown,\r\neminent commander; Harry L. Barnum, generalissimo; Charles J. Stones,\r\ncaptain general; Sylvester W. Holdredge, recorder.\r\n\r\n_Delaware Commandery. No 44._--This commandery is located at Port\r\nJervis. The charter is dated October 6th, 1869, and was issued to\r\nCharles B. Gray, eminent commander; Joseph W. Weed, generalissimo;\r\nAbraham Kirkman, captain general. Charles T. Branch was the first\r\nrecorder. The membership on the 1st of June, 1907, was eighty-one\r\nsir knights. The officers were Theodore Mackrell, eminent commander;\r\nJohn Stoll, Jr., generalissimo; Harry J. Pippitt, captain general;\r\nLewis C. Seager, recorder.\r\n\r\n_Cyprus Commandery, No. 67._--This commandery is located at\r\nMiddletown. The charter is dated October 5th, 1904, and was issued to\r\nCharles Reeve Smith, eminent commander; Ira Lee Case, generalissimo;\r\nFrank Olin Tompkins, captain general. Isaac B. A. Taylor was the\r\nfirst recorder. The membership on the 1st of June, 1907, was 114 sir\r\nknights. The officers were Charles Chester Bogart, eminent commander;\r\nCharles Wesley Rodgers, generalissimo; Ames Everett Mclntyre,\r\ncaptain general; Isaac B. A. Taylor, recorder.\r\n\r\nCryptic Masonry has been recognized as a part of the American system\r\nof freemasonry in the State of New York since 1807, when a grand\r\ncouncil of Royal and Select Masters was duly organized.\r\n\r\nThis branch of freemasonry has never been popular with the craft in\r\nthis State, as the degrees, of which there are three, conferred in a\r\ncouncil, have not been made prerequisite to admission to a\r\ncommandery of Knights Templar, although several attempts have been\r\nmade to that end.\r\n\r\n_King Solomon Council, No. 31._--This council is at this date located\r\nat Poughkeepsie, N. Y. On the 10th of December, 1867, a council of\r\nRoyal and Select Masters was opened under dispensation at\r\nPoughkeepsie, N. Y., which was known as \"Union Council.\" The first\r\nofficers were E. H. Parker, T. I. M.; G. Fred Wiltsie, R. I. M.;\r\nA. B. Smith, P. C. W. At the annual assembly of the grand council,\r\nheld on the 4th of February, 1868, a warrant was issued, and the\r\nname changed to King Solomon Council, No. 31, and the jurisdiction\r\nextended to include the city of Newburgh, N. Y. King Solomon Council\r\nheld stated assemblies at Newburgh from the 18th of March, 1869, to\r\nthe 8th of December, 1879, when it was deemed for the interest of the\r\norganization that it be removed to Poughkeepsie, where it holds\r\nassemblies at the call of the thrice illustrious master.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite was introduced in the State of\r\nNew York in 1813, by the formation, in the city of New York, of a\r\nsupreme council for the northern jurisdiction. For some time previous\r\na lodge of perfection of this rite existed at Albany, N. Y.\r\n\r\n_Adouai Lodge of Perfection,_ located at Newburgh, N. Y., was granted\r\na charter in September, 1873. The lodge conferred the degrees from\r\nthe fourth to the fourteenth inclusive. In 1880 the lodge ceased to\r\nmeet, but the charter was not surrendered, being held in abeyance\r\nsubject to the action of the members in this locality.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the American Adoptive Rite, called the \"Order of the\r\nEastern Star,\" was created by Robert Morris, a distinguished\r\nFreemason. It sought to provide an organization that would be of\r\nbenefit to the wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of master masons\r\nby introducing signs, grips and pass-word that would be recognized by\r\nthe craft generally. For a time it was a popular institution, then\r\ncame a season of depression, until finally the degrees were rewritten\r\nand the ritual made less complex. While this order has not been\r\nrecognized in this State as a masonic body by the grand lodge, still\r\nit does receive recognition and support from a large number of the\r\ncraft who feel that it is a valuable adjunct to freemasonry.\r\n\r\nThe grand chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star was organized\r\nthirty-eight years ago. There are at this date over 350 subordinate\r\nchapters in the State, embracing a membership of over 26,000. There\r\nare five chapters in Orange County.\r\n\r\nOrange Chapter. No. 33, is located at Port Jervis; Queen Esther\r\nChapter, No. 163, is located at Middletown; Hawthorne Chapter, No.\r\n163, is located at Monroe; A. J. Moor Chapter, No. 398, is located at\r\nGoshen. At this date (June, 1907), these chapters are in a\r\nflourishing condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Guy Miller.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nHORSE BREEDING IN ORANGE COUNTY.\r\n\r\nBy Guy Miller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lay of the land in Orange County, hills and valleys, with the\r\nfarms divided in such a manner that each one has a proportion of high\r\nuplands, as well as low meadows, enables the breeder to tide over wet\r\nas well as dry seasons.\r\n\r\nIf the season is wet for the low meadows, the uplands make luxuriant\r\ngrowth, and in a season of drought the lowland pastures and meadows\r\ncan be depended upon for a good supply. The writer has farmed\r\nforty-two years at his home farm and there has never been a season\r\nwhen grass has really failed for animals at pasture or for hay\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nIn seeding land in Orange County, timothy, red-top and the clovers\r\nhave been the principal seeds used in the past. In time these run\r\nout, giving way to grasses that appear natural to this section, viz.,\r\nJune grass, white clover and Seneca grass. These varieties start\r\ngrowing early and continue late, thus making the pasturing season a\r\nlong one. Cut for hay, the quantity of the latter is not equal to\r\nthat first mentioned, yet the quality is considered far superior.\r\n\r\nOrange County being well watered in addition to its abundant supply\r\nof the best natural grasses, makes it an ideal horse-breeding\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nImported Messenger appears to have been the fountain-head of the\r\nhighest type of the American light harness horse.\r\n\r\nImp. Messenger was in service at Goshen in 1801. Jonas Seely, Sr., of\r\nOxford, had a large strong mare of great endurance known as Black\r\nJin, and this mare bred to Imp. Messenger produced Silver Tail.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, the son of Imp. Messenger, known as Hambletonian, made the\r\nseason in Goshen, yet on certain days of each week was taken to\r\nFlorida for service. Silver Tail was bred to Hambletonian and\r\nproduced One Eye, the latter a grand animal and fast trotter for her\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhen Imp. Belfounder was in service at Washingtonville, the season of\r\n1832, Josiah Jackson, of Oxford, owned One Eye, and bred her to that\r\nhorse, producing a mare that was a high-class trotter, and is known\r\nas the Charles Kent mare.\r\n\r\nThe Charles Kent mare had passed through the hands of several owners\r\nto Jonas Seely, of Sugar Loaf. On June 5, 1848, he bred her to\r\nAbdallah and on May 5, 1849, a bay colt with a small star and white\r\nhind ankles, was born.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of that year the Charles Kent mare and her foal were\r\npurchased by Wm. M. Rysdyk, a farmer of Chester.\r\n\r\nMr. Rysdyk was born on a farm between Florida and Goshen. He\r\nfrequently saw the son of Imp. Messenger (known later as Bishop's\r\nHambletonian), pass his home on trips between the above villages,\r\nand, although very young, was so impressed by the rare qualities of\r\nthe horse, that he chose his name for his own colt, now known as the\r\n\"great progenitor of trotters,\" Rysdyk's Hambletonian.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this colt was by Abdallah, a grandson of\r\nImp. Messenger. His grandam was by Bishop's Hambletonian, a son of\r\nImp. Messenger and his great grandam a daughter of Imp. Messenger.\r\nThe blood of this imported horse had given great results in the\r\nlocalities where he had been in service, and the same was true\r\nrelative to his descendants, particularly so in the case of his son,\r\nBishop's Hambletonian and his grandson, Abdallah.\r\n\r\nImp. Belfounder's individuality, his beautiful trotting action and\r\nstrong-inclination to stick to that gait, commanded the admiration of\r\nhorse lovers. His daughter, the Chas. Kent mare, produced\r\nHambletonian, a daughter of his son, King's Belfounder, produced the\r\nrace winning trotter Sir Walter, record 2.27, also by Abdallah.\r\nAnother daughter produced to Cassius M. Clay, Jr., Harry Clay,\r\nrecord 2.29. the greatest of the Clay family as a brood mare sire.\r\n\r\nRysdyk's Hambletonian carried three crosses of Imp. Messenger blood,\r\nconcentrated in the first four generations. It was this unparalleled\r\nwealth of Messenger blood, his rare temperament and individuality,\r\nand the fact that Mr. Rysdyk had driven him, the third time harnessed\r\nto a sulky, a mile in 2.48, on the Union Course, Long Island, the\r\nfall he was three years old, that gave his owner unbounded confidence\r\nin the colt's future. This, the breeding public must have shared, as\r\nat four years of age he served one hundred and one mares, producing\r\nseventy-eight colts at $25.00 each, thus earning for his owner\r\n$1,950.\r\n\r\nIn the late fall of that year two Virginia gentlemen, looking for a\r\nstock horse, visited Mr. Rysdyk's place, and after examining\r\nHambletonian, stood ready to buy him at $10,000, yet Mr. Rysdyk would\r\nnot sell.\r\n\r\nHow well this confidence in the horse's value was borne out in after\r\nyears, for as soon as Hambletonian's colts had become two and three\r\nyears old and were placed on exhibition at the fairs, their high\r\nquality, fine general characteristics, superb trotting action and\r\nbeing almost uniform in rich bay colors, won them nearly all the\r\nprizes.\r\n\r\n                  At the Orange County Fair, Fall of 1853.\r\n\r\n                         _In Show Class._\r\n\r\n First prize was awarded to Hambletonian by Abdallah.\r\n Second prize--Rattler.\r\n\r\n            At the Orange County Fair, September 21st, 22nd, 1858.\r\n\r\n                       _In Show Class for Aged Stallions._\r\n\r\n First prize was awarded to Edsall's Hambletonian (Alexander's\r\n   Abdallah) by Hambletonian                 J.

W. Hoyt. This performance shows the\r\nreal value of the colt records, they having no track education and\r\nno modern appliances such as boots, etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Hetzel, a farmer near Florida, related to the writer years\r\nlater, that he had no idea of competing in the speed class with his\r\ncolt Hambletonian 2nd (Volunteer), and so informed inquirers at\r\nGoshen, yet when it was confided to him that it had been said \"he\r\ndare not,\" \"his Dutch was aroused,\" he borrowed a skeleton wagon and\r\nharness and at his request the judges permitted him to start behind\r\nthe other entries. Mr. Hetzel made no attempt for the lead until\r\npassing the stand the second time when he gave his colt his head,\r\nsoon obtaining a commanding lead and finishing more than seven\r\nseconds ahead of his nearest competitor. Such an ovation as this\r\nchurch deacon and his colt received from an enthusiastic and admiring\r\nassemblage is seldom witnessed.\r\n\r\nMr. Hetzel sold his colt soon after to Sheriff Underhill, of\r\nBrooklyn, for $2,500. The writer sold his colt, the afternoon of his\r\nwinning performance at a handsome price. Lady Howard passed to\r\nGovernor Amsa Sprague, of Rhode Island. In fact, everyone of these\r\ncolts by Hambletonian was soon sold at good prices, yet none were\r\nfrom trotting-bred mares and but one (Alexander's Abdallah) from a\r\nfast trotting mare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hambletonian 10.]\r\n\r\nIt is particularly interesting to note the summary of the trotting\r\nstallions, as American Star and Harry Clay produced the dams of the\r\nrecord breakers of later years.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of Hambletonian's great worth (earning capacity), the\r\nwriter will mention an over-night visit at Mr. Rysdyk's home as early\r\nas 1865, the latter part of June. The next morning Mr. Rysdyk drove\r\nhome behind Lady McClellan to a farm that he had recently purchased\r\nfor the overflow of stock from his home farm. The new purchase was\r\nmade from an up-to-date painstaking man, and good buildings and\r\nfencings, also fertile fields were in evidence; brood mares and foals\r\nand young stock were distributed about in the pastures. Mr. Rysdyk's\r\nson, William, had already commenced the hay making of the season's\r\ncrop. Starting on the drive homeward Mr. Rysdyk inquired, \"How do you\r\nlike the Seely farm, my new purchase?\" The writer could only reply in\r\nlaudatory terms. \"Well,\" said Mr. Rysdyk, \"That farm cost me nearly\r\ntwenty-two thousand dollars and Hambletonian earned the purchase\r\nprice in three months.\" The record on file in the county clerk's\r\noffice in Goshen, gives the seller as Charles B. Seely to Wm. M.\r\nRysdyk. The deed calls for 218 98/100 acres, consideration $21,048,\r\ndated April 1, 1865. No world's records had been won by the get of\r\nHambletonian at this time.\r\n\r\nGeorge Wilkes, under the name of Robert Eillingham, started in his\r\nfirst race on Long Island, August 1, 1861. He made a record of 2.22\r\nat Providence in a race that he won October 18, 1868, making him the\r\nchampion trotting stallion of the world. Jay Gould reduced this\r\nworld's champion stallion record at Buffalo August 7, 1872, to\r\n2.21-1/2. Dexter began trotting May 4, 1864 and at Buffalo, N. Y.,\r\non August 14, 1867, became the world's champion by trotting to a\r\nrecord of 2.17-1/4. George Wilkes, Jay Gould and Dexter were sons of\r\nHambletonian, the last two from daughters of American Star.\r\n\r\nAdded to the marvelous performances of Hambletonian's immediate\r\nprogeny, those of his sons began to come forward. The daughter of\r\nEdsall's Hambletonian (Alexander's Abdallah) Goldsmith Maid, began\r\ntrotting September 7, 1865, at Goshen, N. Y., and at Mystic Park,\r\nBoston, September 2, 1874, reduced the world's record to 2.14.\r\n\r\nSt. Julian by Volunteer made a world's record of 2.11-1/4 at\r\nHartford, Conn.\r\n\r\nThese performers attracted great attention and made a demand for the\r\nproducts of the breeding farms at remunerative prices, stock being\r\npurchased and taken to almost every section of the United States.\r\n\r\nTherow Felter was keeping a summer resort at Greenwood Lake and bred\r\na brown mare to Hambletonian April 22, 1855, the product being George\r\nWilkes, who after his career on the turf, was placed in the stud in\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nCharles Backman established a breeding farm at Stony Ford about 1865.\r\nAt this time the blood of American Star and Cassius M. Clay, Jr.,\r\nparticularly that of his son, Harry Clay, was very popular and Mr.\r\nBackman stocked his farm with many mares by these great sires. He\r\nsold to the Hon. Chas. Stanford, of California, Electioneer, a son of\r\nHambletonian, whose dam was Green Mountain Maid, by Harry Clay; also\r\na small band of brood mares. George Wilkes and Electioneer became\r\ngreat sires and in considering the relative merits of the two\r\nfamilies, it is a debatable question which should be placed first.\r\nMr. Backman's farm, Stony Ford, in the matter of brood acres and\r\nsplendid equipment was unrivaled. The farm turned out race winning\r\nand record-breaking youngsters, splendid roadsters, horses celebrated\r\nas sires, also brood mares of a high order. Many of the first men of\r\nthe country, including General U. S. Grant, enjoyed Mr. Backman's\r\nhospitality. Stony Ford Stock Farm passed to the ownership of Mr. J.\r\nHoward Ford, who, with Austral (winner of the blue ribbon in Madison\r\nSquare Garden), a progenitor of beauty and extreme speed at the head\r\nof a band of choice brood mares, is breeding colts of rare quality.\r\n\r\nSamuel Hill, in this locality, followed by his son, Ed. Hill, bred\r\nhorses in fashionable lines of blood. Jonas Hawkins began breeding\r\nto Hambletonian when he bred the McKinstry mare May 16, 1853,\r\nproducing Shark, record 2.30-1/2, to saddle 2.27-3/4, a winner at\r\none, two and three miles on Long Island tracks. The McKinstry mare\r\nproduced by American Star, Clara, and on May 8, 1857, Mr. Hawkins\r\nbred Clara to Hambletonian, producing the renowned Dexter, record\r\n2.17-1/4. The breeding was continued by Mr. Hawkins's son, Jonathan,\r\nwho bred Dictator, a wonderful sire and several sisters, also\r\nKearsarge by Volunteer. This family is truly great judged by the\r\nrecognized test of greatness, extreme speed and race winning\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nAlden Goldsmith's Walnut Grove Farm near Washingtonville, became\r\nfamous as the home of Volunteer, a horse that attained great\r\nprominence in the stud. Mr. Goldsmith, with his sons, James and John,\r\nshowed rare judgment and skill in the selection and development of\r\ngreat turf performers and as professional drivers the sons were at\r\nthe very top. During the many years that Alden Goldsmith campaigned a\r\nstable of trotters on the Grand Circuit, his horses were the grandest\r\nin existence and his success was brilliant. In this vicinity were the\r\nBrooks, the Moffatts, the Hulses, the Hallocks, the Thompsons, who\r\nbred fine horses and profited thereby.\r\n\r\nThe Mills family of Bullville had been patrons of American Star and\r\nwhen the superiority of the Hambletonian American Star cross was made\r\nevident by the performances of Dexter, they were enabled to breed in\r\nthis fashionable line. Harrison Mills, from Hambletonian and his\r\nAmerican Star mare, Emma Mills, produced Independent and Sweepstakes.\r\nThe former a fine animal that sired speed. The latter a beautifully\r\nshaded bay, individually most perfect in action, really a grand\r\nhorse. Sweepstakes, considering his opportunities was an excellent\r\nsire. James M. Mills bred Chosroes, Imperial and Fisk's Hambletonian,\r\nall by Hambletonian, the latter from Lady Irwin by American Star.\r\nFisk's Hambletonian became quite noted as a sire in Michigan.\r\n\r\nAt Middletown, John E. Wood bred many fine horses, the most prominent\r\nbeing Knickerbocker, son of Hambletonian, and Lady Patchen by George\r\nM. Patchen. J. D. Willis, with Harry Clay, 2.29, at the height of his\r\nstud career, other fine stallions, and a band of choice brood mares,\r\nbred, developed and trained youngsters evidently with pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt Florida, Jefferson Post bred Middletown by Hambletonian from a\r\nmare whose sire, Vivian Grey, was a grandson of the great American\r\nEclipse. Nearby, Joseph Hetzel bred the great Volunteer and his two\r\nfull brothers. Nathaniel Roe, also of Florida, bred Florida, son of\r\nHambletonian and a daughter of Volunteer, a most excellent sire. Mr.\r\nRoe purchased in Kentucky colts, at least three, by famous sons of\r\nGeorge Wilkes, and kept them for service at his farm. William Roe, a\r\nson, inherited his father's estate and is following the paternal\r\nfootsteps in horse-breeding.\r\n\r\nAbout Warwick were the Wellings, the Sanfords, the Wisners, and just\r\nover the county line in New Jersey were the De Kays and Givens. All\r\nbreeders of fine horses. At Bellvale was W. H. Wisner, breeder of\r\nWoeful.\r\n\r\nThe Sayer families at Westtown, bred fine horses, Decater Sayer's\r\nfarm being the center of attraction when that grand individual and\r\nphenomenally gaited horse Harry Clay was broken to harness at four\r\nyears of age and was owned and kept for public service till sold, to\r\nHarry Dater and removed to Long Island, May 8, 1862.\r\n\r\nAt Monroe works, Mr. Peter Townsend, who with his brothers owned the\r\nvast Sterling tract with its two blast furnaces (where the great\r\nchain that spanned the Hudson River, during the war of the\r\nRevolution, was made at his grandfather's Sterling Iron Works), had\r\nnear his house a farm, \"The Old Fields,\" which was mainly used to\r\nbreed horses for the pleasure and use of his family. He first had a\r\ndaughter of American Eclipse, a daughter of Young Engineer (sire of\r\nthe dam of Gideon). From the latter he bred a pair by Abdallah, also\r\na pair by Hambletonian. Mr. Townsend purchased of Lieutenant General\r\nManry (while Professor of Tactics at West Point), Saline, a\r\nthoroughbred mare brought from the latter's home in Virginia, that,\r\nbred to Hambletonian, produced Jas. H. Coleman, quite a trotter for\r\nhis day; and Lord Sterling, that had the thoroughbred finish yet\r\nbeautiful trotting action; also Young Selene by Guy Miller, that by\r\nIron Duke produced Monroe, 2.27-1/2. A sister, Miss Monroe, was the\r\ndam of Fergus McGregor. Young Selene produced by Volunteer, St.\r\nPatrick, 2.14-1/2.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning shadows of Schunnemunk Mountains is \"Glen Lea,\"\r\nthe charming home of Mr. William Crawford. Here may be found Alto\r\nMcKinney, by that great sire of race horses of extreme speed,\r\nMcKinney, 2.11-1/4, dam Cresida, 2.18-1/4 at three years, by Palo\r\nAlto, 2.08-1/4, champion trotting stallion of 1901.\r\n\r\nAt Turner, Thos. Lewis bred Dandy, a daughter of Young Engineer, to\r\nHambletonian, producing Gideon, that sired the dam of the great\r\nperformer Nelson, also from Dandy and Iron Duke, Silver Duke,\r\n2.28-1/4.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Pierre Lorillard (the only American who has attained the\r\ndistinction of winning the classic event of the world, the English\r\nDerby, with a horse of his own breeding), was a patron of\r\nHambletonian--the youngsters being raised on one of his Tuxedo farms.\r\nR. F. Galloway near Turner was a breeder to Abdallah and\r\nHambletonian. Guy Wilkes cost him $500 at three years, at seven years\r\nhe dealt this horse to E. W. Teakle, receiving the famous Princess,\r\n2.30 and $3,500. Princess had been bred to Hambletonian and the next\r\nspring (1863), gave birth to Happy Medium, 2.32-1/2, that in February\r\nof 1871, was sold to Robert Steel of Philadelphia, Pa., for $25,000.\r\n\r\nNear Newburgh, Mr. Jas. Hasbrouck bred horses, and on his half-mile\r\ntrack, Judge Fullerton, Mountain Boy, Music and others received their\r\nharness education and acquired great speed. Mr. Aymar Van Buren,\r\nalways a horse lover, procured from Wm. M. Rysdyk, Molly, daughter of\r\nLong Island Black Hawk and Betsy by Imp. Belfounder, from\r\nHambletonian and Molly, Mr. Van Buren bred Effie Deans, 2.25-1/2 and\r\nLottie, 2.28, placing Molly in the great brood mare list. This was\r\nin the seventies and Mr. Van Buren is still breeding and finding\r\npleasure with his horses. Mr. J. A. P. Ramsdell is breeding The Arab,\r\nthat retains the beautiful type, great courage and endurance of his\r\ndesert ancestry.\r\n\r\nAt Goshen in the early days of trotting horses were J. S. Edsall,\r\nowner of the famous Alexander's Abdallah, also breeder of Fleetwing\r\n(dam of Stamboul. 2.07-1/2). John Minchen, later owned a stock farm\r\nat Stony Ford with Young Woeful and Tom Mare for stud service. This\r\nJohn Minchen farm was later purchased by General Benjamin F. Tracy\r\nand called Marshland stud. It was stocked with trotters impotent\r\nblood: Advertiser, 2.15, sire of the world's fastest yearling\r\ntrotter, Adbell, 2.23 and others; Lord of the Manor, by Mambrino King\r\n\"handsomest horse in the world,\" and Kiosk, a son of Kremlin,\r\nchampion trotting stallion of 1892. The brood mares were choice and\r\nit was a great loss to Orange County when General Tracy discontinued\r\nbreeding at this farm.\r\n\r\nMr. Geo. S. Wisner bred Samson and other most excellent horses at his\r\nfarm. Edmund Seely owned American Star, a horse that by his unique,\r\nopen, stride, great courage, quality of endurance that served him\r\nthrough great hardship to the end of his days, without blemish, made\r\nthe breeding on qualities of his progeny a wonderful contribution to\r\nour American trotters.\r\n\r\nParkway Farm, made one of the real beauty spots of Goshen by the late\r\nowner, Senator McCarty, takes the highest rank as a breeding\r\nestablishment, with the great Joe Patchen (the iron horse), sire of\r\nthe wonderful horse, Dan Patch and other performers. The form of Joe\r\nPatchen is such that his services are sought from every section in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. E. H. Harriman paid $41,000 for Stamboul to place at the\r\nhead of his Arden Farms Breeding establishment at Goshen, he became\r\nthe owner of a champion, whether on the turf or in the show ring.\r\nWhen Elsie S. by Stamboul (bred by Mr. Harriman) defeated Mr. Marcus\r\nDaly's Limerick in the $5,000 match race at Goshen, 1898, the joy of\r\nOrange County breeders was complete.\r\n\r\nMr. Harriman's patronage has had a wonderful influence in uplifting\r\nand popularizing the sport of competition of the light harness horse\r\nin Orange County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nDAIRYING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some seventy-five years past the most important crops produced on\r\nthe Orange County farm has been, and is to-day, milk. This alone\r\nexceeds the combined value of all else the farmer produces. All other\r\ncrops are gathered once a year only, but a new crop of milk is in\r\nevidence every day, Sundays and holidays included. Under existing\r\nconditions the producer has no difficulty in disposing of all he can\r\nmake at a market so close at hand that it can be delivered within an\r\nhour from the time it is drawn from the cow. Thus it is a continual\r\nsource of ready and regular revenue.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1842 the total, and for many years later a large majority,\r\nof the output was turned into butter right at the farmer's home. As a\r\nrule the farmer's wife personally attended to churning, working and\r\npacking the butter into the tub, all ready to be sent to market.\r\n\r\nOrange County butter was a trademark that achieved a wide reputation\r\nas denoting an article of superior quality, and the yellow bills\r\nissued by the Bank of Orange County were known far and wide as\r\n\"butter money.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Orange County farmer no longer makes such disposition of his\r\nmilk. To both himself and his wife, butter-making is a lost art.\r\nBesides he is no longer a farmer but a \"dairyman\"' or \"milk\r\nproducer,\" for his principal business is to supply the market with\r\nmilk, What farming he does is merely a side issue.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of these changed conditions dates back to 1842, when\r\nthe Erie railroad, then hardly out of its swaddling clothes, carried\r\nto New York the first consignment of milk that ever reached that city\r\nby way of a transportation line.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the city of New York contained, approximately, a population\r\nof 315,000 and used about 30,000 gallons (3,000 cans, forty quarts\r\neach), of milk daily. A large proportion of this was produced within\r\nthe city limits, very much (probably a large majority) of which was\r\nthe output of cows kept in stables connected with and fed on the\r\nrefuse of distilleries and breweries. Very aptly this was termed\r\n\"swill milk,\" for it was all that the name implies. The balance was\r\nbrought in by wagons from the surrounding farms.\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer of 1842 Philo Gregory, a milk producer at\r\nChester, N. Y., was induced to try the experiment of shipping milk to\r\nthe New York market. At this time the road was in operation as far\r\nwest as Goshen, with its eastern rail terminus at Piermont, on the\r\nHudson River, twenty-four miles from New York and forty-one miles\r\nfrom Chester. At this point all passengers and freight were\r\ntransferred and reached the city by boat. There were many doubting\r\nThomases who contended that it was impossible to carry milk this\r\ndistance and deliver it in good condition. But the experiment was a\r\nsuccess from the start, so much so that there was a continual call\r\nfor more dairies and a gradual increase in the number of shippers.\r\nOrange County milk soon gained as favorable a reputation in the New\r\nYork market as Orange County butter had previously achieved. More or\r\nless sour milk was in evidence from time to time, enough at least to\r\ngive excuse for the aforementioned doubters to exclaim: \"I told you\r\nso.\" Comparatively little trouble arose from this source, however,\r\nas nearly all shipments were in merchantable condition when received.\r\nIf otherwise this was not due to the distance hauled, but the lack of\r\nproper care.\r\n\r\nIn the first few shipments wooden churns were used, these being the\r\nmost convenient vessels at hand. But tin cans soon came into use.\r\nThese were of five sizes, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty and sixty\r\nquarts each. Although milk was shipped twice a day, morning and\r\nevening, it was not considered safe to send what was left over from\r\nany one milking. For this reason every shipper provided himself with\r\nall these sizes as a means of cleaning out as closely as possible.\r\nAt this time an ice house was an institution unknown to the farm. To\r\nthe milk producer of to-day an ice house is regarded as almost as\r\nmuch of a necessity as the milk can or the cow. But in 1842 and for\r\nsome years later, natural facilities for keeping milk from day to day\r\ncould be found on nearly every farm. Flowing springs, the temperature\r\nof which never rose above about fifty degrees, were then plentiful in\r\nOrange County, much more common than now. It was some time after Mr.\r\nGregory made his first shipment that farmers learned to use these\r\nsprings, and discontinue the morning shipment. It was later still\r\nwhen the majority ceased yarding their cows early in the afternoon\r\nand shipping this milking the same evening. Since these early days\r\nmuch has been learned about how to keep milk in good condition for a\r\nlong time. But even now the great possibilities in this direction are\r\nnot suspected by the average producer.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the road was operated as far west as Middletown, in 1846 to\r\nOtisville, and in 1848 to Port Jervis. The only portion of the\r\nterritory thus traversed that was well adapted to the production of\r\nmilk lay between Otisville and Greenwood (now Arden) a distance of\r\nthirty-one miles. The total amount of milk shipped in 1842 averaged\r\nabout forty-five; in 1843, 275 cans, and in 1844 some 420 cans daily.\r\n\r\nThe first regular milk train was run on the 3d day of May, 1847. It\r\nran morning and evening, leaving Otisville at 6.30 A. M. and 4.15\r\nP. M., scheduled to reach New York at 11.30 A. M. and 9.15 P. M.\r\nOtisville continued to be the western terminus for the run of the\r\nmilk train until 1868, when it was extended to Port Jervis. Not until\r\n1884 was any attempt made to develop any of the extensive and\r\nexcellent milk territory lying west of Port Jervis. All efforts in\r\nthe direction of securing increased supplies were centered on the\r\neastern (now New York) division. Here, by its branches and connecting\r\nlines, it made practically every can of milk produced in Orange\r\nCounty available to the New York market. Prior to twenty-five years\r\nago nearly every producer shipped his milk direct to the dealer.\r\nWhile these conditions prevailed the milk manifest at any station\r\nwhere a large amount of milk was loaded contained so many names of\r\nshippers and consignees that it resembled the poll list of an\r\nelection district. At these same stations now, although loading more\r\nmilk than formerly, it is unusual to find more than two or three\r\nshippers. While the list of consignees has not decreased to the same\r\nextent, still it is very short as compared with the former period.\r\nThe one time shippers are now patrons of the local creamery, from one\r\nto three of which may be found at every station.\r\n\r\nThe first butter and cheese factory, or creamery, started in the\r\nState of New York was located near what is now the Crystal Run\r\nStation of the Ontario and Western Railway. This was about 1856. It\r\nwas cooperative, owned and operated by the farmers of the\r\nneighborhood. The object was to lessen the labor at the household and\r\nalso make a more uniform quality of butter than was possible when\r\nchurned at each individual home. The cream was made into butter, the\r\nskimmed milk into cheese and the whey mixed with grain turned into\r\npork. Thus nothing was wasted and the venture proved successful.\r\nOther similar factories were started in different sections and\r\ninside of ten years Orange County was dotted over with such\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nGenerally they were operated as co-operative concerns, and quite as\r\ngenerally, due to lack of proper management, were unsuccessful. As a\r\nconsequence they were either abandoned or passed into the possession\r\nof private parties and were no longer used exclusively for\r\nmanufacturing. More money could be realized by shipping milk. Only\r\nsuch as could not be disposed of in this way was turned into butter\r\nand cheese.\r\n\r\nThis Crystal Run factory was the progenitor of the present day\r\nshipping stations from which the New York market now receives\r\napproximately ninety-eight per cent, of its milk supply and\r\npractically all its cream.\r\n\r\nPrior to the foundation of the New York milk exchange, in October,\r\n1887, the price paid for milk delivered at these factories, or\r\nshipping stations, was determined by the highest market price of\r\nbutter. Stockholders in the co-operative factory were paid whatever\r\nmight be earned, but when milk was purchased outright the producer\r\nreceived the price of one pound of butter for every twelve (or\r\n12-1/2 as might be agreed) quarts of milk delivered.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk exchange began to announce prices (which prevail until\r\notherwise announced) the stations accepted these as a basis and\r\nbought at a discount that ranged from ten to twenty cents per can of\r\nforty quarts. Later these discounts were lowered from time to time\r\nand now range from ten cents to nothing.\r\n\r\nNearly all of these stations are now operated by dealers who use them\r\nas a source of supply for their city trade, the balance conducted by\r\nparties who have no interest in the city business, but supply such\r\ndealers as do not care to operate a place in the country.\r\n\r\nIn the county of Orange are (including its three condenseries)\r\nseventy milk shipping stations, every township being represented by\r\nfrom one to twelve. Mount Hope has the one, Warwick the twelve.\r\n\r\nIn addition are two cheese and one butter and cheese factory, the\r\nlatter the celebrated Neufchatel cheese factory of William E.\r\nLawrence & Son, at Chester. In 1906 this establishment turned out\r\n7,000 pounds of butter, 600,000 pounds of Neufchatel and 273,000\r\npounds of square cream cheese.\r\n\r\nFrom January 1st to December 31st, 1907, the daily average output of\r\nmilk in the county approximated 9,400 cans of forty quarts each.\r\nThis was disposed of about as follows:\r\n\r\n Shipped to the New York market    6,000 cans, 40 quarts each.\r\n Consumed in the county            1,850  \"     \"    \"     \"\r\n Condensed                           750  \"     \"    \"     \"\r\n Turned into butter and cheese       400  \"     \"    \"     \"\r\n Skimmed or cream                    400  \"     \"    \"     \"\r\n                                  ______\r\n Daily average production          9,400 cans,  40 quarts each.\r\n\r\nFor milk shipped from 1842 to 1854 or 1855 producers received the\r\nfollowing prices:\r\n\r\n       Months.                      Cents per Quart.\r\n May, June, July and August                 2\r\n March, April, September and October        3\r\n November, December, January and February   4\r\n                                           __\r\n Yearly average                             3\r\n\r\nIn 1854 or 1855 the Milk Dealers' Union was organized for the avowed\r\npurpose of determining future prices. This body proposed to (and did)\r\nmeet on the tenth day of every month and \"make a price\" for the\r\npreceding month. Thus, the producer did not know how much he would\r\nreceive for his milk until ten days after it had been shipped,\r\ndistributed and consumed.\r\n\r\nThis was so palpably unjust and one-sided that producers were\r\nindignant and since then have formed many counter organizations and\r\ncombinations for the purpose of taking the price-making power out of\r\nthe hands of dealers. All these were failures.\r\n\r\nThe present system of fixing prices, in vogue since 1882, is more\r\nequitable. It is the producer's own fault that it is not the best\r\nthat could be devised. The Consolidated Milk Exchange, an\r\nincorporated stock company, announces prices in advance of delivery.\r\nThis is merely an offer to pay a specified price until otherwise\r\nannounced. This constitutes a legal price, inasmuch as no one is\r\nunder any obligation to deliver any milk, provided the offer is not\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nWith one added feature it would be a perfect way of satisfactorily\r\nsettling the matter of price, a problem that has for fifty years\r\npuzzled the brains of the wisest milk producers in Orange County.\r\nThat this feature is lacking, milk producers alone are responsible.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk exchange was incorporated and before organization was\r\ncompleted, producers were invited, urged and pleaded with, both by\r\ndealers and the more progressive, level-headed producers, to\r\nsubscribe for half of the capital stock and thus be entitled to equal\r\nrepresentation on the price committee. But this they refused. Had the\r\noffer been accepted producers would have a voice in deciding prices,\r\na conceded right which for fifty years they have been striving to\r\nsecure but voluntarily surrendered, when once within their grasp.\r\n\r\nOf all the movements for gaining control of prices, the action of\r\nMarch, 1883, was the most notable. Very few members of the numerous\r\nassociations organized for this purpose were willing to admit that\r\nsupply and demand had, or should have, any influence in determining\r\nthe market price of milk. Nevertheless, the keystone of every effort\r\nto advance prices was by curtailing the supply. This was to be\r\naccomplished by persuading producers to withdraw part or all of their\r\nshipments until dealers were brought to terms.\r\n\r\nBut it was difficult to find anybody willing to keep his milk home\r\nand thereby realize two cents a quart, while his neighbors continued\r\nto ship and were paid three cents. For this reason every scheme of\r\nthis kind was doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nEarly in March, 1883, the managers of the Milk Producers' Association\r\nof Orange County, reinforced by their brethren of Sussex County,\r\nN. J., notified the dealers that the market price of milk for that\r\nmonth would be three and one-half cents a quart. This brought about\r\na conference of the opposing forces. Dealers offered three cents for\r\nthe first and three and one-half cents for the last half of the\r\nmonth. Neither party would recede from its position and both resolved\r\nto fight it out on these lines.\r\n\r\nProducers proposed to withhold all shipments, commencing about the\r\n15th, until dealers were starved into submission. Experience had\r\nshown that something more powerful than moral suasion would be\r\nrequired to induce producers to discontinue shipping.\r\n\r\nHence the leaders in this movement determined to use force where\r\npersuasion failed. For this purpose a \"spilling committee\" was\r\nappointed for each station and instructed to be where it could do the\r\nmost good about the time a milk train was due. The orders were not to\r\nallow a can of milk to pass into the possession of the railway\r\ncompany. This was to be done peaceably, if possible--forcibly, if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nPursuant to these instructions, would-be shippers were halted on the\r\nhighway and ordered to take their milk back home. Some protested\r\nmildly, but finally obeyed orders. Some objected strongly and their\r\nmilk was poured into the street.\r\n\r\nBut there were still others who were determined to ship or fight.\r\nThey gave the \"spillers\" to understand that they would not tamely\r\nsubmit to highway robbery, that they intended to ship their milk, and\r\nthat an undertaker would be needed to care for any one who attempted\r\nto prevent it.\r\n\r\nMany drove to cross-roads between stations where by previous\r\narrangement the train would stop and load the milk. It was useless\r\nto appeal to local authorities for protection from the \"spillers,\" as\r\nthey were either afraid or too indifferent to take action.\r\n\r\nIt was reported that the Governor had been appealed to, and was about\r\nto issue orders to the sheriff of Orange County to quell the\r\nrebellion, but the blockade was voluntarily raised after a\r\nthree-days' struggle.\r\n\r\nShipments of dairy milk in Orange and Sussex Counties fell off about\r\ntwenty per cent., but creameries shipped more than usual, presumably\r\nenough to reduce the net falling off to about fifteen per cent.\r\nFortunately no blood was shed in this war, but much milk fell by the\r\nwayside. It was not a victory for producers, as bills were settled on\r\nthe terms originally offered by dealers, three cents for the first\r\nand three and one-half cents for the last half of March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS D.

He was of Scotch or\r\nScotch-Irish ancestry, and according to a tradition of the family he,\r\nor his father before him, sailed from Bally Castle, County Antrim, in\r\nthe north of Ireland. This was a shipping port in that early date,\r\nand is just across from Scotland. A recent writer has said: \"Francis\r\nBaird (never Beard) may have been Irish by nativity, but not by\r\nancestry. The Bairds of Avondale were an ancient and powerful Berg\r\nScots clan, and as long ago as the wild days of the struggles between\r\nRobert Bruce and John Baliol for the Scottish crown (1309), gave\r\nbrave account of themselves on the side of the Lord of Lome against\r\nthe finally victorious Bruce. The name, originally (Norman-French)\r\nBayard, was shortened into Baird by neighbors after the family passed\r\ninto Scotland from France at a very early date. Francis was an\r\noffshoot and clansman of this stock.\"\r\n\r\nHe built the stone house on Main street in 1766.\r\n\r\nMr. Baird was a man of intelligence and comparative wealth. He was a\r\nsigner of the non-importation pledge of 1775, and lived and died in\r\nWarwick in warm esteem.\r\n\r\nHe died in the latter part of 1799 or the first part of 1800, and\r\nleft a will disposing of his property.

Among the important\r\nplants he has equipped may be mentioned those of the Light, Heat and\r\nPower Companies of Newburgh and Poughkeepsie, the Chatham, Coxsackie\r\nand Rhinebeck electrical stations, and he now has the contract for\r\nheating the United States Government buildings at West Point, N. Y.\r\nMr. Barnes' success may be attributed to his close attention to\r\nbusiness and fulfilling his contracts to the letter. From a humble\r\nbeginning he has built up a business in the space of fifteen years,\r\nexceeding all others in his line in Orange County. His show rooms at\r\n107 Broadway will compare favorably with any in New York State. In\r\n1895 he married Miss Cory, of Rhode Island, and one daughter has been\r\nborn to them.\r\n\r\nJ.

Elder James Benedict came to Warwick in 1765 and made his home\r\nin a log house near Chonck's Hill--he had separated from the church\r\nin Ridgefield, Conn., because of unjust demands of the tithe-master\r\nand very soon after coming to Warwick lent his efforts toward\r\nestablishing the First Baptist Church. The first house built for\r\nworship was one over which he was pastor and stood at the fork of the\r\nroad nearly opposite the church burying ground--on an angle which\r\nstill continues to be church property. He left Warwick in the year\r\n1773, and moved to Wyoming, Pa., because of difficulty arising in the\r\nchurch through prejudice toward the Order of Free Masons, of which he\r\nwas a member and which connection saved the lives of himself and\r\nfamily at the fearful Wyoming massacre when a secret signal from\r\nBrandt brought mercy and safe escort to peaceful territory, he\r\nreturned to Warwick at once and died here, September 9, 1792, aged\r\nseventy-two years. He is buried beside his wife, Mary, near where the\r\nchurch stood. The stone house just east of Warwick village was built\r\nby his oldest son, James, in 1779, and has descended through\r\nsucceeding generations to the present owners--the children of Captain\r\nJas. W. Benedict.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. BENEDICT was born in the stone house about one mile from\r\nWarwick, Orange County, September 2, 1834.

He removed to Warwick in April, 1867, and\r\nremained there until his death, September 22, 1883. James attended the\r\ndistrict school and the Florida Institute. He assisted his father on\r\nthe farm during his younger days and has always made farming his\r\noccupation. He removed to Warwick in 1871. remaining there about nine\r\nyears, when he again took up his residence on the Wickham farm, where\r\nhe resided until his death, which occurred February 17, 1898. He was\r\na member of the Grange, a prosperous farmer and a good citizen. Mrs.\r\nBenedict has presented the International Sunshine Society with a plot\r\nof land on her farm near Wisner, on which the society will erect a\r\nbungalow costing about $2,000. The plot is beautifully located,\r\npresenting a fine view of the surrounding country. On it is a spring\r\nthat never freezes, supplying an abundance of pure water. The place\r\nis to be known as \"The James D. Benedict Sunshine Rest Home.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES H. BENEDICT was born on the Benedict homestead in the old stone\r\nhouse at Stone Bridge, February 13, 1854. and lived there with his\r\nfather thirty-five years.

Coming North when but a lad of thirteen, he\r\nentered one of the Brooklyn public schools, and later attended the\r\nWinchester Academy in Winchester Center, Conn., where he remained for\r\ntwo years. From the time when he left the academy until he entered a\r\nbusiness college, young Borden assisted his father in establishing\r\nthe condensed milk business, then in its infancy.\r\n\r\nThe call for volunteers in 1861 interrupted the business college\r\ncourse, and Mr. Borden, then but nineteen years of age, enlisted at\r\nPoughkeepsie, N. Y., under Colonel (the late General) John Henry\r\nKetcham, in the 150th N. Y. Volunteers, serving in his regiment for\r\ntwo years and a half, and attaining the rank of second lieutenant\r\nduring that time. Just before his regiment started for the front, the\r\nyoung patriot presented himself for baptism and membership in the\r\nArmenia, N. Y., Baptist Church, and in the years following gave every\r\nevidence of a consistent Christian life.\r\n\r\nHis service in the \"150th\" was terminated by a serious illness,\r\ncaused by the severe strain and exposure of army life, and Mr. Borden\r\nwas compelled to return to his home for rest and recuperation. When\r\nsufficiently recovered, he was transferred to the 47th N. Y.\r\nVolunteers, and remained with that regiment until the close of the\r\nwar. Returning to his home in Brewsters, N. Y., Mr. Borden became\r\nactively identified with the Borden Condensed Milk Co., and upon the\r\ndeath of his father, in 1874, succeeded him as its president.\r\n\r\nDuring his connection with the company, he made many valuable\r\nimprovements in the methods of manufacturing condensed milk, and\r\notherwise firmly established the reputation of the Borden Condensed\r\nMilk Co.\r\n\r\nRemoving in 1881 from Brewsters to Wallkill, N. Y., he purchased the\r\nproperty known as the \"John P. Andrews farm,\" comprising about two\r\nhundred acres, and by acquiring adjacent lands from time to time, the\r\n\"Borden Home Farm\" was made to cover an area of some fifteen hundred\r\nacres. Most, if not all, of this property was a part of an original\r\ngrant of land deeded by Queen Anne, in 1709, to \"her true and loving\r\nsubjects.\" Here Mr. Borden built a large condensery for the Borden\r\nCondensed Milk Co., continuing the management of the business until\r\n1884, when failing health compelled him to retire from an active\r\nbusiness life. From that time until his death, Mr. Borden gave his\r\nwhole attention to the improving and beautifying of his \"Home Farm,\"\r\ntrying, as he expressed it, to \"make two blades of grass grow where\r\nbut one grew before.\" With all the improvements made upon the farm,\r\nhe did not indulge in what is known as \"fancy farming,\" but aimed\r\nrather to make his improvements on a practical basis, furnishing\r\nobject lessons which any energetic farmer might easily put into\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nIn politics Mr. Borden was a staunch Republican, firmly believing in\r\nevery citizen taking an Active part in the politics of his town, and\r\nconscientiously performing his duty at the primaries and the polls.\r\n\r\nMr. Borden's patriotism increased with years, and he was one, if not\r\nthe first, of the pioneers who labored to impress upon the minds of\r\nthe children a strong love for country and \"the Stars and Stripes,\"\r\nand each Decoration Day he presented to every child in the public\r\nschools in his vicinity, a small American flag; continuing this\r\npractice until his death. Among Mr. Borden's characteristics, none\r\nwere stronger than his devotion to home and country. Courtesy and\r\ngentleness were also marked characteristics with him, and his hat was\r\nremoved as quickly for a little girl as for a lady. He was a true\r\ndisciple of the \"gospel of labor,\" and one of his unwritten mottoes\r\nwas, that \"what was worth doing at all was worth doing well,\" which\r\nrule was followed out in all his undertakings. He worked incessantly\r\nand was old before his time. Mr. Borden died in October, 1891, at\r\nOrmond, Fla., where, as well as in the North, he left an enviable and\r\nlasting record of practical Christian living. He lived but\r\nforty-seven years--a short life, but one so filled with work for God\r\nand humanity, that its value cannot be estimated by the number of\r\nyears alone.\r\n\r\nCHARLES CLAYTON BOURNE, brick manufacturer, was born in Brooklyn,\r\nN.

He married Miss Nancy E.\r\nMorrow and five children have been born to them.\r\n\r\nGRINNELL BURT was born in Bellvale, Orange County, N. Y., on November\r\n7, 1822. He was a grandson of James Burt, who for twenty years was a\r\nprominent legislator of the State. An orphan at fourteen, he was\r\nthrown on his own resources. With unusual ability for mechanical\r\nconstruction, and a mind that quickly grasped all opportunities for\r\ndeveloping the resources of the country, he became interested in\r\nrailroad projects. Meanwhile his love for the law prompted a course\r\nof reading and study which proved of great value when corporate\r\ninterests were committed to his charge.\r\n\r\nWith others he organized, in 1859, the Warwick Valley Railroad. The\r\ngrowing needs of the valley called for various extensions of the\r\nline. Mr. Burt's pluck and rare executive ability served his\r\nconstituents well. By the last consolidation the road was merged into\r\nand known as the Lehigh & Hudson River Railway Company. He was its\r\ncontinuous and only president forty-two years, dying in office. He\r\nwas identified with various projects for bridging the Hudson. His was\r\nthe vision to project the Orange County Railroad--\"the missing\r\nlink\"--between the West and Southwest and New England, via the\r\nPoughkeepsie Bridge. This dream of his old age he pushed through\r\nwith indomitable energy, enduring many anxious hours in its\r\nconsummation, but which to-day justifies all his sagacious commercial\r\nforesight. The record of this Warwick railroad, while under his care,\r\nwas that it never had a strike, never was in the hands of a receiver,\r\nnever defaulted in the payment of the interest on its bonds, and no\r\npassenger lost his life during Mr. Burt's long administration. He\r\nselected his subordinates with rare judgment. At his death the new\r\npresident retained to a man the entire corps that had served under\r\nMr. Burt. No better choice could be made.\r\n\r\nThe other roads he served for varying terms as director, reorganizer,\r\nsuperintendent or president, were the Pittsburgh & Western;\r\nCincinnati, Van Wert & Michigan (now the Cincinnati, Jackson &\r\nMackinaw); New Jersey Midland (now the New York, Susquehanna &\r\nWestern); Kanawha & Ohio; New York & Greenwood Lake; Middletown,\r\nUnionville & Water Gap, which he brought out of its chaotic condition\r\nand placed on a sound footing, and the Toledo & Ohio Central,\r\ngenerally conceded to be one of the most successful reorganizations\r\nof a bankrupt company ever effected.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Governor Tilden appointed him one of three commissioners to\r\nremove obstructions from the Delaware River. The commission served\r\nwithout pay, and after their work was thoroughly done a balance was\r\nreturned to the State treasury--a result so unusual in the\r\nexpenditure of public money that it excited no little comment.\r\n\r\nNo public work was ever dearer to Mr. Burt than the establishment of\r\nthe Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital. Serving as chairman of the\r\nbuilding committee he saved the State much money by his watchful\r\ncare. He was appointed by Governor Dix on the first board of trustees\r\nof this noble institution, and gave twenty-seven years of ungrudging\r\nservice; acting first as vice-president, he eventually became\r\npresident for the eleven successive years before his death. All this\r\nhe did amid the stress and strain of conflicting business cares in\r\nbehalf of suffering humanity.\r\n\r\nIn Warwick his name was coincident with its progress. He was one of\r\nthe agitators for incorporating it under a special charter; an\r\nincorporator of Warwick Institute, serving thirty-two consecutive\r\nyears on the board of education; one of the founders of Christ\r\nChurch; on the committee of three to bond the town to pay volunteers\r\nin the late rebellion; on the first board of trustees of the Warwick\r\nCemetery Association, active in building the reservoir and\r\nwater-works; on the first board of directors of the First National\r\nBank, where he served as vice-president for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe American Trossachs trip, which he inaugurated, was one of his\r\nmany-schemes to bring our valley's beauties into a wider recognition.\r\nThis excursion as planned by him would challenge comparison for\r\nvaried interest and charm with any one day's excursion taken in any\r\npart of the world. Mr. Burt also did much for the development of\r\nGreenwood Lake. The artistic station and his own stately home, both\r\nbuilt under his direction and out of our native McAfee limestone,\r\nare evidence that Grinnell Burt was a man of taste and culture as\r\nwell. If you would see his monument, look about you in the little\r\nvillage he so loyally loved and served.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 he married Miss Jane S. Van Duzer, daughter of Isaac Van\r\nDuzer, of Warwick, by whom he had one son and four daughters: Frank\r\nHoward, who died in infancy; Kate V. D., who married Charles\r\nCaldwell, of Newburgh; Lily, wife of Frederick Halstead, of Brooklyn;\r\nJane, who died in 1903, and Mary Herrick Burt, who resides in the old\r\nhomestead. Mrs. Burt died in 1870. In 1886 he married Miss Louise\r\nPierson, daughter of Samuel V. Pierson, of Middletown, N. Y. By this\r\nmarriage he had twin sons, Grinnell, Jr., and Howard Pierson. Mr.\r\nBurt died August 3, 1901.\r\n\r\nSurely a few words of tribute should be added in honor of this man\r\nwhose unfaltering honesty, ability and enthusiasm called to his side\r\nnoble helpers and the capital necessary to carry out these difficult\r\npublic works. Personally he was possessed of most genial social\r\ntraits--to see him in his home was to see him at his best. Here he\r\ndispensed the widest hospitality. He held high national ideals free\r\nfrom party lines. He was capable of long hours of unremitting\r\nphysical and mental toil. He did not waste his energy talking about\r\nthings he would like to do--he did them. He was acknowledged to be a\r\nwinning and witty public speaker, and, when occasion demanded, a\r\nformidable antagonist, as he was absolutely fearless and not to be\r\nshaken from his convictions; and yet being {?} so fair withal that\r\nhis warmest personal friends were among those with whom he differed\r\non many occasions. In every walk of life he was a man.\r\n\r\nWhen death came it seemed only a momentary interruption and to point\r\nback triumphantly to his long and honorable life of service.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BURT, of Warwick, was born January 5, 1821. Both of his\r\nparents died when he was about fifteen years of age. He then lived\r\nwith his uncle, Thomas M. Burt, in Albany, who sent him to an academy\r\nfor one year. The next year he was employed in the printing office of\r\nPacker and Van Benthuysen. The next three years, he was employed in\r\nfarming in central Ohio. In 1841 he returned to his native place,\r\nBellvale, and soon after bought his father's farm and sawmill, which\r\nhe operated until 1868, when he moved to his farm in Warwick, where\r\nhe now lives. In 1846, he married Hannah Sayer, and lived a married\r\nlife with her over fifty-four years. His surviving children are\r\nElizabeth, Lydia, Annie, and Mrs. Vernon B. Carroll.\r\n\r\nThe next seven years he was in the lumber and coal business in the\r\nfirm of Taylor, Burt and Pierson. In 1876 he organized the Warwick\r\nSavings Bank and has served as secretary and treasurer to the present\r\ntime. As secretary and treasurer of the Warwick Cemetery Association\r\nhe has had the care of its records and funds for twenty-six years. He\r\nwas one of the commissioners who introduced public water into the\r\nvillage. He has served as trustee in the district school, academy,\r\nand Union Free School for many years, and as executor and\r\nadministrator of estates and of trust funds.\r\n\r\nHe is independent in politics, has never held public office, has\r\nsupported free soil, anti-slavery, and republican candidates, as well\r\nas Grover Cleveland.\r\n\r\nFRANK V. BURTON--Among the many private residences which grace the\r\nbanks of the Hudson River at Balmville, none is more imposing in\r\nappearance than \"Woodbine,\" the beautiful summer home of Mr. Frank V.\r\nBurton, located on Big Hill on the river road. In 1850 Mr. Josiah H.\r\nBurton, who is now in his eighty-second year and father of the\r\npresent owner, purchased a tract of land of about one hundred acres\r\nand resided in a handsome home nearer the river than the present\r\nmansion is situated. The property was afterward purchased by his son,\r\nFrank V., who in 1895 constructed his present ideal residence. The\r\nbuilding is a three-story structure, 125 by 40 feet in dimensions and\r\nof Normandy style of architecture, with a covered piazza extending\r\nthe whole length of the east side. The residence is surrounded by\r\nspacious lawns, filled with the choicest flowers and ornamental\r\nshrubs, while the river view from the house is one of the most\r\nmagnificent to be found in the country, extending a distance of ten\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nGILLMORE O. BUSH, who has held various public offices in what is now\r\nthe town of Tuxedo, was born at Arden, Orange County, in 1863. After\r\nattending the district and parish schools he took a commercial course\r\nat the Paterson Business College. Mr. Bush then spent five years in\r\nConnecticut, and in 1886 came to Tuxedo Park and was appointed a\r\nmember of the newly organized police force. After serving four years\r\nas patrolman he was promoted to chief of the department, which\r\nposition he still retains. He has been deputy sheriff of the county\r\nof Orange since 1886. In 1899 Mr. Bush received the appointment of\r\npostmaster at Tuxedo Park and was reappointed in 1904. He has acted\r\nas assistant chief of the fire department since 1901. He is a charter\r\nmember of Lorillard Lodge, F. and A. M.\r\n\r\nMr. Bush is a son of James S. and Eliza J. (Minerly) Bush, old\r\nresidents of Orange County.\r\n\r\nHORACE G. BUSH, son of Peter B. and Harriet (Ford) Bush, was born in the\r\ntown of Monroe, Orange County, N. Y., March 13, 1863, on the farm\r\nwhere he has always resided. The Bush family have long been prominent\r\nin the affairs of Orange County and in 1905 Horace G. was elected a\r\nmember of the board of supervisors. Socially he is identified with\r\nthe Masonic fraternity. He married Mary F. Smith, and two sons, Peter\r\nand Horace S., have been born to them.\r\n\r\nThe early representatives of the Bush family emigrated from Holland.\r\nHenry, the great-grandfather of Horace G., was a native of Orange\r\nCounty. He was the father of five sons, of whom Peter H., by his\r\nmarriage to Abigail Smith, became the father of Peter B., referred to\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nCHARLES CALDWELL was born in the town of New Windsor, March 31, 1839,\r\nthe son of John R. and Ruth Nicoll Caldwell, and grandson of Richard\r\nCaldwell, the Irish patriot.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from Albert Roe's School of Surveying and Civil\r\nEngineering at Cornwall, Mr. Caldwell opened an office in Newburgh,\r\nand in 1863 was appointed corporation surveyor, and later was\r\nannually appointed city surveyor, holding the office for nearly forty\r\nyears. He was known to be a republican in politics, having no\r\ninfluence with democratic mayors or boards of aldermen.\r\n\r\nMr. Caldwell laid out all the streets of Newburgh opened since 1867,\r\nplanned and superintended the building of twenty miles of sewers,\r\nlaying the twenty-four-inch conduit from Washington Lake and building\r\nthe large stone arch bridge spanning Quassaick Creek.\r\n\r\nMr. Caldwell's reputation as an expert surveyor and engineer was well\r\nknown throughout the State, and his services in important and\r\ncomplicated surveys were always in demand, especially where suits\r\nwere brought before the court for decision.

His faithfulness and ability in the bank are\r\nattested by the facts that in 1890, at the age of twenty-five, he was\r\nmade its cashier, and later one of its directors, which office he\r\nstill holds to the satisfaction of business associates and bank\r\npatrons. The year that he was promoted to cashier he was also\r\nappointed clerk of the village and clerk of the water-works, and\r\nthese positions he has continuously retained.

His first employment was with John and William Rothery,\r\nwho operated a file shop in Matteawan, N. Y. He was later employed by\r\nH. W. Swift, who had a machine shop at Wiccapee, in the town of\r\nFishkill, and who was experimenting in the manufacture of lawn\r\nmowers fashioned after Budding's grass cutters manufactured in\r\nEngland. Mr. Coldwell, who was endowed with genius for invention,\r\nactually made the first lawn mower produced by Mr. Swift. He became\r\nassociated with Mr. George L. Chadborn, who was also in the employ of\r\nMr. Swift, and in 1868 Mr. Coldwell, with the assistance of Mr.\r\nChadborn, invented a new lawn mower, resulting in the formation of\r\nthe Chadborn & Coldwell Mfg. Co., at Newburgh, N. Y., with Mr.\r\nColdwell as president, which continued until 1891, when Mr. Coldwell\r\norganized the Coldwell Lawn Mower Co., mention of which appears\r\nelsewhere in this work. Suffice it to say that their daily output\r\napproximates seven hundred complete mowers for each working day in\r\nthe year and it is the largest plant in the world devoted to the\r\nmanufacture of these machines.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to note briefly the history of\r\nlawn mowers. There is some doubt who was the original inventor. An\r\nold document has been found in the United States Patent Office, dated\r\n1825, which shows that one James Ten Eyk, of Bridgewater, N. J.,\r\ninvented a mowing machine. It was simple, having a box like a wagon\r\nbox, with the forward end open, furnished with two shafts, one at the\r\nfront end, on which were placed the revolving cutters, and the other\r\nabove the center of the box on which were the driving wheels, and on\r\nwhich the box was hung. The driving shaft had on it two drive pulleys\r\ncorresponding with two smaller ones on the cutter shaft and the two\r\nwere connected by means of two rope belts. It was a revolving-cutter\r\nfield mower, and is the first revolving cutter of which any record\r\ncan be found, but the inventor did not claim that it was a lawn\r\nmower. The next authentic record of a revolving-cutter mower was one\r\ninvented by Edwin Budding, of Stroud, Gloucestershire, England.\r\nBudding was born near Stroud in 1796. He was evidently an inventor,\r\ndraftsman and mechanic of considerable ability. He invented the\r\nBudding wrench and various machines for use in the manufacture of\r\nwoolen cloth. He was superintendent for the late George Lister, a\r\nmanufacturer of Dursley, England. P. A. Lister (son of George), who\r\nsucceeded his father (and from whom many of these facts regarding\r\nBudding emanate), stated that there was no doubt but that Budding\r\ntook the idea of the lawn mower from a cloth clipping machine. He was\r\ngranted a patent for his new invention, dated October 25, 1830, and a\r\ncircular owned by Mr. Budding's daughter, dated 1830, shows that he\r\nsold three sizes of lawn mowers, manufactured by John Farrabee near\r\nStroud. These facts leave no doubt that to Budding belongs the credit\r\nof producing the first lawn mower.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1855 probably all lawn mowers used in America were of\r\nEnglish make. A few years prior to this Mr. H. W. Sargent, of\r\nFishkill, received a mower from England and sent it to Mr. Swift to\r\nbe repaired, and it was upon Mr. Sargent's suggestion that Mr. Swift\r\nbegan the manufacture of these machines. His circular, dated 1835,\r\nstates that he made four sizes ranging in price from $30 to $80. For\r\na number of years Mr. Swift had a monopoly of the lawn mower trade in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nAbout 1868 the Hills Lawn Mower Co. was started in Hartford, Conn.\r\nThey made the Archimedian Mower. It was the first machine made with\r\nonly two revolving cutter blades, and sold for $45. Other\r\nmanufacturers were Graham, Emlen & Passmore, of Philadelphia, who\r\nproduced the first side-wheel mower. In 1885 some patents on the best\r\nmowers expired and many small manufacturers sprang up in all parts of\r\nthe country, who have contented themselves by making the cheaper\r\ngrades. A few lawn mowers are made in Canada, Germany and France, but\r\nthe United States produces four-fifths of all lawn mowers made in the\r\nworld, and they are exported to every part of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe business established by Thomas Coldwell is now continued by his\r\ntwo sons, William H. and Harry T., both of whom were brought up in\r\nthe lawn mower business by their father. He is also survived by a\r\nwidow and daughter, the latter the wife of Mr. E. C. Ross, who is\r\nassociated with the Coldwell Brothers in the lawn mower industry.\r\n\r\nGALEN COLEMAN was born near Mount Hope, Orange County, N. Y.,\r\nDecember 31, 1859.

Soon afterward he\r\nmoved to Orange County, bought the Quackenbos farm near Neelytown,\r\nnow known as the Beaver Dam Farm, and proceeded to improve it so that\r\nit became one of the most attractive places in the state. The farm is\r\nrich and highly cultivated, the palatial home is surrounded by a fine\r\ngrove of hundreds of sugar maples.

Y.,\r\nAugust 29, 1826, the son of Peter and Maria Wilde Darlington. Through\r\nhis mother many lines of colonial ancestry met in him. A descendant\r\nof Deputy Governor Bishop, of Connecticut, who was secretary of that\r\ncolony from 1661 to 1665; of Daniel Rayneau, the first freeholder of\r\nthe Huguenot colony of New Rochelle; of Richard Wilde, Esq., of\r\nFlushing, N. Y.; and from Edward Griffin, of the Virginia colony, on\r\nhis father's side he was from the Darlingtons of Yorkshire, England,\r\nand Edinburgh, Scotland. His father, who was one of the first paper\r\nmanufacturers in this country, died January 21, 1851, but his mother\r\nlived to be over one hundred years of age, until August 20, 1900. He\r\nacquired his education in the local schools near at hand, graduating\r\nwith highest honors, and at seventeen, by his own choice, was\r\nprincipal of a school in a neighboring village. Resigning his school\r\nposition he went to New York City and studied law in the office of\r\nMr. Taggart, reciting at the same time in the evenings to private\r\ntutors in Latin and philosophy. He was of a very religious\r\ntemperament, being a constant attendant at church and having a\r\nSunday-school class, of which he was very fond.\r\n\r\nSoon after becoming an attorney and counselor-at-law he started in\r\nbusiness for himself, and achieved a most rapid success. The firm\r\nname was Darlington, Spring & Russell, and some most important cases\r\nwere entrusted to their care. When Mr. Spring died, Mr. Russell went\r\nto Cornell University as dean, and a new firm was formed of\r\nDarlington, Irving & Hoffman.\r\n\r\nHis interest in all games and amusements was great, being the\r\namateur editor of the chess column in a New York weekly paper for\r\nsome years.\r\n\r\nIn politics he was a strong abolitionist, and took an active part in\r\nthe anti-slavery movement. So pronounced was his position and so well\r\nknown, that on July 13, 1863, during the draft riots in New York\r\nCity, a mob broke into his law offices and smashed all the furniture.\r\nMr. Darlington afterward sued the municipality for the damage\r\nwrought, and was the first to recover in an action of this sort, the\r\ncase being referred to to-day as marking a new line of municipal\r\nresponsibility. As the mob was killing returned Union soldiers and\r\nhanging colored people to the lamp-posts, at his own expense he sent\r\ndown a whole colored family that had been pursued, to his country\r\nhome in Kingston, N. J., and kept them there some months until the\r\ndanger was over.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the renomination of General Grant for a second term as\r\nPresident, one of the general's friends offered Mr. Darlington the\r\nappointment of chief justice of the then territory of Colorado, but\r\nhe was most devoted and adhered to his friend of many years, Horace\r\nGreeley, who was the nominee of the liberal republican and democratic\r\nparties, and so the appointment was not made. He resolutely and\r\nconsistently declined to engage in politics, but blamed himself for\r\nover-leniency in the case of Guiteau, who afterward shot President\r\nGarfield. Having a criminal suit against Guiteau, he had him shut up\r\nin prison, but after being there some months Guiteau wrote a most\r\npitiful letter, saying that longer confinement meant his death, and\r\nMr. Darlington, thinking that he had been punished enough, signed a\r\npaper consenting to his discharge. It was only a month or two after\r\nhis release that he murdered President Garfield, and Mr. Darlington\r\nappeared against him as a witness at his trial.\r\n\r\nIn his religious life Mr. Darlington always attended the Presbyterian\r\nChurch, and was teacher of the Bible class in the Mulberry Street\r\nMission of the South Park Church in Newark, N. J., for years.\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1850, he married Hannah Anne Goodliffe, daughter of\r\nJames Yarrow Goodliffe, and the issue was eight children; two, Alfred\r\nErnest and Alice, deceased, and six, James, now Protestant Episcopal\r\nbishop of Harrisburg, Pa.; Thomas, J., now president of the board of\r\nhealth of New York City; Charles Francis, counselor-at-law; Gustavus\r\nC., a physician; Marion Goodliffe, and Mrs. Margaret Darlington-Wilde,\r\nliving. His death came suddenly, on the 18th day of May, 1903, and he\r\nwas buried from the same church in which he was married, the\r\nUniversity Place Presbyterian Church, University place and Eleventh\r\nstreet, New York City, from which his wife was also buried about two\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DARLINGTON, M.D., was born in Brooklyn, N. Y., September 24,\r\n1858; son of Thomas Darlington and Hannah A. (Goodliffe) Darlington.\r\nHis education began in the public schools of New York and Newark,\r\nN. J., followed by a three years' scientific and engineering course\r\nat the University of the City of New York. After his graduation, he\r\nentered the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, from which\r\nhe was graduated as M.D. in 1880. He engaged in the practice of\r\nmedicine at Newark, N. J., for two years, holding several hospital\r\nappointments. In 1882 he located at Kingsbridge, N. Y., and practiced\r\nthere until 1904, except for two years spent in Arizona, where he was\r\nsurgeon to several mining companies. He was appointed commissioner of\r\nhealth for the city of New York in 1904, and was reappointed for the\r\nsecond term in 1906. His administration has been thoroughly\r\nefficient and has demonstrated the wisdom of the selection of a\r\ntrained medical man as head of the department of health of a great\r\nmetropolis like New York, where the sanitary problems are necessarily\r\nvery complex, and their proper solution of vital importance. Dr.\r\nDarlington has been an extensive contributor to medical literature.\r\nHe is ex-president of the American Climatological Society, a member\r\nof the American Medical Association, the New York State Medical\r\nSociety, the New York County Medical Society, the Medico-Legal\r\nSociety, Association of the Alumni of the College of Physicians and\r\nSurgeons, American Public Health Association, Harlem Medical\r\nAssociation, New York Physicians' Mutual Aid Association, Medical\r\nSociety of the Borough of the Bronx, Medical Association of Greater\r\nNew York, Yonkers Practitioners' Society, Society of Medical\r\nJurisprudence and Academy of Medicine; and until his appointment as\r\nhealth commissioner of New York, he was visiting physician to several\r\nof the hospitals of the city and consulting physician to the French\r\nHospital.

Dunning,\r\nfor many years the law partner of Charles O'Conor, and his mother was\r\nRuth Seely, of Orange County, New York.\r\n\r\nFrom his father Mr. Dunning inherited a predilection for the law, and\r\ndoubtless his early association with his father's firm helped to\r\ndevelop in him his high ideals of professional ethics.\r\n\r\nHe was prepared for college in Dresden, Saxony, and was graduated\r\nfrom Princeton University in the class of 1877. He devoted himself\r\nwith more than usual assiduity to his studies, and was particularly\r\ninterested in the classics.

His relations with his\r\nprofessional brethren were always marked with great consideration,\r\nand while he jealously guarded the interests of his clients, an\r\nopposing attorney could never justly complain that Mr. Dunning had\r\nnot shown to him the courtesy demanded by the most exacting\r\nprofessional etiquette. While not ambitious for position or office\r\nwhich would bring him prominently before the public, he was greatly\r\ninterested in his professional work and desirous that it should be\r\nwell done. His relations with the various partners with whom he was\r\nassociated during his career have always been most cordial and\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 he married Clara Frost, of New Orleans, La., and the years\r\nthat followed were filled with domestic happiness. His wife and six\r\ndaughters who survive him mourn the loss of a kind and loving husband\r\nand a wise and affectionate father. His life is a continuous record\r\nof high ideals and work well done. He died in the prime of life,\r\nrespected by all who knew him, and loved by those who knew him best.\r\nIn this age of excitement and greed, such a life as his should be an\r\nexample and an inspiration.\r\n\r\nTHE DUNNING FAMILY--General Benj.

HEADLEY was born December 30, 1813, at Walton, Delaware\r\nCounty, N. Y., where his father was settled for many years as the\r\nPresbyterian clergyman. Mr. Headley early determined to make his\r\nfather's vocation his own, and after graduating from Union College,\r\nin 1839, he took a course in theology at the Auburn Theological\r\nSeminary.\r\n\r\nAfter being ordained he was settled over a church at Stockbridge,\r\nMass., and immediately entered with enthusiasm upon the discharge of\r\nthe numerous duties inseparably connected with the sacred office. He\r\nsoon found, however, that his constitution, already undermined by\r\nmany years of unceasing application and incessant study, was unable\r\nto stand the further strain imposed upon it, and he was reluctantly\r\ncompelled to relinquish his chosen profession, and in 1842 went to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nWhile abroad he occasionally contributed articles to the press and\r\nperiodicals, and the favorable manner in which they were received\r\nencouraged him to offer to the public his \"Letters from Italy.\" The\r\ngratifying reception at once accorded to this work first turned his\r\nmind seriously toward literary pursuits, and soon after his return\r\nfrom Europe he yielded to the solicitations of his friend Horace\r\nGreeley, and became the associate editor of the _New York Tribune._\r\nThe confining duties necessarily connected with the duties of an\r\neditor soon became irksome to him, and at the end of a year he\r\nsevered his connection with that paper and henceforth pursued the\r\npath of authorship. In 1846 \"Napoleon and His' Marshals\" appeared,\r\nand was followed at various periods by \"Washington and His Generals,\"\r\n\"History of the War of 1812,\" \"Life of Cromwell,\" \"Life of Havelock,\"\r\n\"Life of Scott and Jackson,\" \"Sacred Mountains,\" \"Sacred Scenes and\r\nCharacters,\" \"Sacred Heroes and Martyrs,\" \"Headley's Miscellanys,\"\r\n\"The Imperial Guard,\" \"Chaplains and Clergy of the Revolution,\" \"The\r\nGreat Rebellion,\" \"Grant and Sherman,\" \"Life of Farragut, and Our\r\nNaval Commanders,\" and \"History of the Great Riots,\" besides other\r\nworks of lesser note.\r\n\r\nMr. Headley's literary work suffered a few year's interruption when,\r\nin 1854, he was elected to the New York assembly from the First\r\nDistrict of Orange County, and the year following was chosen\r\nsecretary of the State of New York. Mr. Headley did not lay down his\r\nbusy pen until late in life, and the popular favor which was accorded\r\nhim at the outset of his career never entirely left him, and all his\r\nbooks were remunerative.\r\n\r\nMr. Headley's passionate love for nature in all her various moods led\r\nhim nearly forty years ago to seek those great solitudes which the\r\nAdirondacks had at that time kept concealed from all men save the\r\ntrapper or woodsman. He was so enamored of that Switzerland of\r\nAmerica that for over thirty years he made yearly pilgrimages for\r\nhealth and pleasure to that beautiful region. He was probably the\r\nfirst tourist to visit that section, and his descriptions of its\r\ncharms and health-giving powers soon induced large numbers to visit\r\nit, and thus led to its becoming the great fashionable resort it is\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nFor over thirty years Mr. Headley resided in Newburgh and vicinity,\r\nand always took an active interest in the historic scenes and acts\r\nwith which our locality abounds. The patriotic attempts of several of\r\nour citizens to secure the preservation of that venerated building,\r\nWashington's Headquarters, received his hearty support, and for many\r\nyears he was president of the trustees of the headquarters.\r\n\r\nBelieving in the importance of fixing in the minds of the people all\r\nthose events which are vitally connected with the fate of our\r\nrepublic, he early conceived the idea of celebrating in some public\r\nmanner those historic events which have made Newburgh famous in\r\nAmerican history. To him more than any other individual is due, not\r\nonly the inception, but also the successful carrying out of our\r\ncentennial celebration in 1883.\r\n\r\nMr. Headley passed the allotted span of life, dying at Newburgh,\r\nDecember 30, 1897, in his eighty-fourth year.\r\n\r\nJACOB L.

The homestead upon which this man settled has remained in\r\nthe possession of the family and is now owned and occupied by Floyd\r\nE. Myers, a brother of the doctor.\r\n\r\nGEN. ALFRED NEAFIE--Alfred Neafie was born in Walden, Orange County,\r\nN. Y., January 8, 1832, being the son of Cornelius Neafie, a member\r\nof one of the old Knickerbocker families, who came to New York in\r\n1637.\r\n\r\nCornelius Neafie built the first cotton mill in Orange County and the\r\nsecond in the State. As a boy Alfred Neafie, fond of hunting and\r\nfishing and of an adventurous turn of mind, it is not strange that he\r\nshould at the age of nineteen, start for the newly discovered gold\r\nfields of California.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1851 that he left in a sailing vessel, the _Grecian,_ for\r\nthe six months' voyage \"'round the Horn.\"\r\n\r\nHis first vote was cast in the canyons of the North Yuba in the\r\nSierra Nevada Mountains. During his successful career in California\r\nhe was a member of the celebrated Vigilance Committee and was one of\r\nthose who helped to apprehend the famous outlaw \"Yankee Sullivan,\"\r\nand was present at the trial and hanging of Juaquin Murat and\r\n\"Three-Fingered Jack.\"\r\n\r\nReturning home at the death of his father and starting in business in\r\nEllenville, N. Y., yet at the outbreak of the war Mr. Neafie put\r\naside personal interests and went to the front. He was offered the\r\ncaptaincy of the Walden Company of the 124th Regiment, but declined\r\nit, as he had already raised nearly two companies of what became the\r\n156th Infantry.\r\n\r\nHis military record is to be found in brief in the Historical\r\nRegister and Dictionary of the United States Army, Vol. 1, page 741,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Neafie, Alfred, N. Y., N. Y. Capt. 156th N. Y. Inf., 13th Sept.,\r\n1862; Lt.-Col., 9th Jan., 1864; Lt.-Col. Vols., 13th March, 1865, for\r\ngal. and meritorious services at Battle of Winchester and Fisher\r\nHill, Va., and Brig.-Gen. Vols., 13th March, 1865, for conspicuous\r\ngallantry at Winchester, Va., 19th Sept., 1864. Mustered out 23d\r\nOct., 1865.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the war Gen. Neafie was provost marshal of Alexandria, La.,\r\nand Baton Rouge.\r\n\r\nWhile at Savannah he held the offices of supervisor of trade,\r\ncollector of military taxes, relief commissioner and assisted in the\r\nrepatriation of the South, as by virtue of seniority of rank he was\r\nchief of staff of the department.\r\n\r\nA few of the brilliant and picturesque events of his military career\r\nwere:--\r\n\r\nAfter the capture at Washington, Ga., of the archives of the\r\nConfederacy, which included records of Generals Beauregard, Polk,\r\nJoseph E. Johnston and Albert Sidney Johnston, $300,000,000 of cotton\r\nbonds, $760,000 in gold and silver and thirty wagon loads of valuable\r\njewelry and personal articles, General Neafie, with two federal\r\nofficers and two treasury agents, inventoried and sent to their\r\nproper owners, scattered all through the Southern States, all private\r\nproperty, while all public property was turned over to the United\r\nStates Government. This was done in about two months.\r\n\r\nAs General Grover's chief of staff, General Neafie received Jefferson\r\nDavis when he was captured and delivered him to Lieutenant-Commander\r\n(now admiral, retired) Luce, in command of the double-ender _Pontiac,_\r\nin Savannah River.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, Jr., a most lovable boy about ten years old, was a\r\nguest in the house in Savannah where General Neafie lived, they drove\r\ntogether daily and a great affection sprang up between the two.\r\n\r\nHis early death of yellow fever in Memphis was a sorrowful event for\r\nall who knew him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Neafie with General Grover was present at the solemn and\r\nthrilling raising of the flag at Fort Sumter, four years to a day\r\nfrom the time it was lowered by Sergeant Hart.\r\n\r\nIt was taken from the sealed mail bag, where it had been placed by\r\nSergeant Hart, who now released it from its leathern prison, and once\r\nmore raised to its place of honor.\r\n\r\nWhen this was done it was seen that the flag was pierced by at least\r\nthirty shell fragments, and was ragged and torn; not a star had been\r\nshot away.\r\n\r\nWhen that fact was disclosed to the men who had been fighting four\r\nyears to keep the stars of our Union together, the emotion was too\r\ngreat for expression.\r\n\r\nBut from outside came the noisy welcome from the battered and\r\nindented ironclads and monitors, who had been circling around waiting\r\nto give tongue with their cannon throats.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the war, General Neafie has led a business life of\r\nwide and varied interests, with homes in Ellenville and Goshen, N. Y.\r\n\r\nMOSES F. NELSON, notary public, real estate and insurance broker of\r\nthe town of Highlands, Orange County, N. Y., was born at Highland\r\nFalls in 1867, and for the past seventeen years has been identified\r\nwith public affairs of his native place, serving as tax collector,\r\nclerk and member of the Board of Education and justice of the peace.\r\nHe is a son of the late Cornelius Nelson, who for thirty years was\r\npostmaster at Highland Falls and who was also engaged in the fire\r\ninsurance and real estate business, which was conducted under the\r\nfirm name of Cornelius Nelson & Son, and to which he succeeded.\r\n\r\nSocially Mr. Nelson is a member of the Knights of Pythias. He married\r\nMiss Mary Adolph in 1893; they have three daughters.\r\n\r\nTHE NICOLL FAMILY--Within the corporate limits of Washingtonville,\r\nN. Y., lies a farm of one hundred and forty-five acres which bears\r\nevidence of the supervision of an energetic and capable family. This\r\nplace is known as the Nicoll homestead, and was occupied for over a\r\nquarter of a century by John Nicoll, who died in 1874. As the name\r\nindicates he was of Scotch descent. The progenitor of this family in\r\nAmerica was Dr. John Nicoll, who emigrated to this country in 1711\r\nand settled in New York. He became one of the leading men of the\r\ncolony and acquired the ownership of a large amount of property,\r\nhaving among his possessions fourteen thousand, five hundred acres of\r\nland in the Minisink Patent. He died in 1743 at the age of\r\nsixty-four.\r\n\r\nJohn Nicoll was born in Hackensack, N. J., in 1799, and in early life\r\nwas engaged in the mercantile business in New York City, whence he\r\nremoved to Orange County in 1844. By his first marriage to Juliana\r\nThompson, one son, William, was born, who died at the age of\r\ntwenty-six. The second wife of Mr. Nicoll bore the maiden name of\r\nElizabeth H. White and was born in Blagg's Cove in 1808. She died in\r\n1855. To this union eight children were born, of whom Charles and\r\nElizabeth White (now the wife of Andrew S. Glover) reside in\r\nWashingtonville. Another son, Isaac, met death while leading his\r\ncompany in the battle of Gettysburg in 1863. On the soldiers'\r\nmonument at Salisbury Mills is this inscription: \"To the memory of\r\nCaptain Isaac Nicoll, Company G, 124th N. Y. S. V., and the men of\r\nBlooming Grove who fought in the war for the unity of the Republic,\r\n1861-1865.\"\r\n\r\nREV. STANISLAUS J. NOWAK, rector of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, Florida, N. Y. In the year 1893 our Polish neighbors at\r\nFlorida, N. Y., after mature deliberation and consultation, concluded\r\nto have their own church, and the necessary steps were taken to\r\nsecure the approval of the church authorities for their project.\r\nHaving demonstrated the feasibility of the idea, and the necessary\r\napproval having been obtained, Messrs. John and Anton Dulski, Joseph\r\nAndryszak, Joseph Wozniak, Ignatius Brink and John Majorowski were\r\nappointed as collectors, and succeeded so well that within two years\r\nover two thousand dollars were subscribed.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1895, Rev. Stanislaus J. Nowak was appointed and entered\r\non his work as rector of the new church. Father Nowak is a native of\r\nPosen--Germany-Poland--studied at Germany and at Rome and came to\r\nthis country at the express wish of Archbishop M. A. Corrigan, and\r\nfinished his theological studies and was ordained priest at the\r\nProvincial Seminary at Troy, N. Y., by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Tierney,\r\nof Hartford. After spending a short while at Shokan, Ulster County,\r\nFather Nowak was appointed as assistant to the Very Rev. Dean Sweeny,\r\nof St. Joseph's Church, Kingston, N. Y., and while there Father\r\nNowak received his appointment as rector of the Polish Church. Since\r\ncoming to Florida, N. Y., Father Nowak has been a successful as well\r\nas an indefatigable worker, and under his supervision the church was\r\nready for the dedication in November.\r\n\r\nWith all the pomp and ceremonial of the Catholic ritual, the new\r\nchurch of the Polish congregation at Florida was dedicated on Sunday,\r\nNovember 10, 1895, by Archbishop Corrigan, to the service of God\r\nunder the patronage of St. Joseph. The solemn high mass on that date\r\nwas celebrated by the Very Rev. E. M. Sweeny, of Kingston, N. Y.\r\n(with whom Father Nowak lived as assistant before coming to Florida).\r\nFather McCorry, of Goshen, acted as deacon, and Father Nowak as\r\nsub-deacon, and Father Connolly, the archbishop's secretary, acted as\r\nmaster of ceremonies.\r\n\r\nAfter the gospel had been chanted by the deacon, his grace, the\r\narchbishop ascended the steps of the altar and after a few very well\r\nchosen words of congratulation to the pastor and people on the happy\r\nculmination of their work in offering a church free of debt for the\r\npurposes of divine worship, preached an able and scholarly sermon on\r\nthe holiness of the church, and during his remarks he was listened to\r\nwith rapt attention, showing that his words had made a very deep\r\nimpression. The Polish sermon was preached by Rev. Dr. M. Barabasz,\r\nof Baltimore, Md.\r\n\r\nThe rectory was built the same year and occupied in December. St.\r\nJoseph's congregation owns its own cemetery, which was blessed in\r\nOctober, 1896, and is located at Union Corner.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1892, Father Nowak was transferred to New York City, where\r\nhe organized a new Polish congregation, and established St. Joseph's\r\nHome for the Polish Immigrants on Broad street.\r\n\r\nFather Michael Slupek was in charge of St. Joseph's Church at Florida\r\nfor nearly two years, and was succeeded by Rev. Joseph Kloss, who was\r\npastor of St. Joseph's until October, 1902. At that time Father Nowak\r\nreturned to St. Joseph's, and under his management the church is\r\nfreed from debt again.\r\n\r\nThe church will be enlarged this year, as it is too small for the\r\ncongregation. There are thirteen hundred Polish people in Florida and\r\nvicinity. The Poles of Florida are showing a desire and aptness to\r\ndevelop into a most industrious and desirable class of citizens.\r\n\r\nARTHUR E. O'CONNOR was born March 10, 1867, at Brooklyn, N. Y. He is\r\na son of John S. and Hanna (Marrett) O'Connor. To this union seven\r\nchildren, one son and six daughters, were born.

BENJAMIN B. ODELL--In reviewing the life of this venerable and\r\ndistinguished citizen of Newburgh, a few words regarding his ancestry\r\nwill not be amiss. The family is of French and English descent, but\r\nhas been represented in America for many generations. His\r\ngrandfather, William Odell, was born in New York City, and there for\r\nsome years he was proprietor of the Bull's Head Tavern. In 1835 he\r\nmoved to Orleans County, N.

He was a\r\nsuccessful farmer and financier.\r\n\r\nHe was an ardent republican in politics and rarely missed voting.\r\nWithout being an office seeker he was at one time the supervisor of\r\nthe town. Being an ardent patriot and unable in the early sixties to\r\nqualify as a soldier and go to the front, he aided by recruiting\r\nbetween fifty and sixty men for service under his country's flag.\r\n\r\nHe had a most equable disposition; kindly and charitable. He took a\r\ngreat interest in young men and loved to help them, and not a few in\r\nthe town owe much of success to the wise counsel and start in life he\r\ngave them.\r\n\r\nA quiet vein of humor was always ready to manifest itself when that\r\npart of his nature was appealed to. He was also noted for his\r\nhospitable traits, and many, far and near, will testify to sharing\r\nthe comforts and pleasantries of his attractive home.\r\n\r\nJAMES EVERETT SANFORD was born at Sandfordville, near Warwick,\r\nJanuary 21, 1859.

His parents were Ezra\r\nand Adaline (Terry) Sanford. He attended the district school in his\r\nlocality, after which he attended a private school at Poultney, Vt.,\r\nand college at Ann Arbor Mich. The subject of this sketch and his\r\nfather were identified at Sandfordville, Orange County, in the\r\ntanning business until 1880, when William M. continued the business\r\nfrom that period until his death, which occurred August 17, 1887. He\r\nwas reared on the Sanford homestead, about two miles from Warwick. He\r\nmarried Sarah Burt in October, 1856.

Y., which has been in the family since 1768, and was\r\npurchased by Daniel Sayer, his great-grandfather, of Henry Wisner,\r\nwho lived in the town of Goshen. He obtained his early education at\r\nthe Warwick Institute and has always been identified with farming. He\r\nalso operates a distillery on the farm, which was established in\r\n1812. He married Miss Annie Wagoner, of Glenburnie, Ontario, Canada,\r\nMarch 15, 1893. Three children were born to this union: Helen\r\nBennett, born December 18, 1893; Mary Eraser, born June 2, 1895, and\r\nBenjamin Wagoner, born December 9, 1896. In politics Mr. Sayer is\r\nindependent. He is a member of Warwick Lodge, No. 544, F. and A. M.,\r\nand the Warwick grange. The farm on which Mr. Sayer resides was the\r\nplace first settled on by the Warwick pioneers.\r\n\r\nGEORGE S. SAYER, for many years a leading business man and farmer of\r\nWesttown, N. Y., was born in 1812, and died in 1884. As a young man\r\nhe taught school a few years, and in 1836 went to Indiana, where he\r\nremained ten years. In 1852 he resumed farming, near Westtown, and in\r\n1872 built a store and home in the village. He married Emeline C.\r\nEvans and six children were born, Jonathan Sayer, now the postmaster\r\nat Westtown, being the second child. After finishing his schooling he\r\nassisted his father on the farm.\r\n\r\nHe married Miss Sarah Owen and two sons were born: George O., a\r\nlawyer in New York, and Robert E., who resides at Westtown. In 1902\r\nMr. Sayer was appointed postmaster, and the management of the farm,\r\npassed to his son, Robert E., who was born in 1876, and educated at\r\nthe schools of Hackettstown. He chose for his wife Miss Frances\r\nHorton.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BENJAMIN SAYER. The Sayer family is of English extraction and\r\nis mentioned as living at Poddington, England, in 1309. This is the\r\nline from which the Thomas Sayer descended, who came from\r\nBedfordshire, England, to Lynn, Mass., and from whom the Sayers in\r\nthis country are descended. He built the old Sayer single house in\r\n1648 at Southampton, Long Island, New York, said to be the oldest\r\nEnglish house standing in New York State.\r\n\r\nThe Sayers came to Orange County in 1750. William Benjamin Sayer, a\r\ndescendant of the above mentioned Sayers, now owns and occupies the\r\nstone house situated on Main street, Warwick, N. Y., which was built\r\nby Francis Baird in 1766. It was called the Stone Tavern and was used\r\nas one until 1830. The mechanics who built this house came from New\r\nYork City, and when completed it was considered the model house in\r\nthis section. The most of the timbers are hewed oak with wide pine\r\nplank floors. This house has been in the Sayer family since 1858.\r\nAmong the distinguished persons who stopped at the house are General\r\nGeorge Washington and wife, and the room on the northwest corner on\r\nthe second story is said to have been the room where they slept. Here\r\nare kept a number of old time relics to show to friends. The present\r\nowner, W. B. Sayer, was born in this room, March 14, 1866, and has\r\nalways lived in the house with his sister, Miss M. Eva Sayer.\r\n\r\nRev. James Manning, a Baptist minister, and his wife, from\r\nProvidence, R. I., took dinner here Sunday, September 12, 1779. He\r\nsaid in his diary: \"We had an elegant dinner and were treated very\r\nhospitably by Francis Baird.\"\r\n\r\nMarquis De Chastelliux, major-general in the French army serving\r\nunder Count Rochambeau, stayed all night here with his aides,\r\nDecember 6, 1781. He says: \"I lodged at Warwick, at a very good inn\r\nkept by Mr. Smith, who rented of Francis Baird, and had every reason\r\nto be content with this establishment.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Pelton, a prominent local historian and grandfather of our\r\nsurveyor of that name, when he first came here, in 1805, stayed his\r\nfirst night in Warwick in this house. A picture of this house will be\r\nfound in this volume.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHRADE CUTLERY COMPANY, of Walden, N. Y., is the youngest of the\r\nindustries that have made that village the Sheffield of America.\r\nEstablished in a modest way April 19, 1904, by George and J. Louis\r\nSchrade, its growth has been very rapid and the value of their\r\nproduct now exceeds $100,000 worth annually. The plant which the\r\ncompany erected is a substantial frame structure, thirty by\r\neighty-five feet, three stories in height, equipped with modern\r\nmachinery and up-to-date methods of manufacture, employing about one\r\nhundred hands. One hundred different styles of pen and pocket knives\r\nare produced and the goods find a ready market all over the United\r\nStates. The Schrade brothers are natives of Williamsport, Pa. George,\r\nthe president of the company, has resided in Walden since 1894, and\r\nis the inventor, patentee and for ten years the sole manufacturer of\r\nthe press button knife in connection with the Walden Knife Works. Mr.\r\nJ. Louis Schrade came to Walden in 1904. He had previously been\r\nengaged in the manufacture of self-playing pianos in New York,\r\nBoston, London and Paris. Both brothers are members of the Masonic\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN H. SCHARFF was born at Amsterdam, Holland, February 26,\r\n1834. He came to America with his father, and the family settled in\r\nNewark, N. J. He was graduated from Princeton College in 1853, and\r\nstudied law with Joseph P. Bradley (justice of supreme court).

Y.\r\nHis early education was acquired at the Wallkill Academy, where he\r\ngraduated in 1878. For two years he was engaged as traveling\r\nsalesman, and one year in the merchandise business in Goshen, N. Y.\r\nMr. Schoonmaker has not sought prominence in life, but has devoted\r\nhimself entirely to his business. In 1882 he associated himself with\r\nthe Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co., holding the position of\r\nbookkeeper for three years and assistant superintendent for seventeen\r\nyears. He has been identified with the Borden Condensed Milk Co.\r\nsince 1902, and for the past three years has held the position of\r\nsuperintendent. April 21, 1897, he married Miss Mary J. McNish, of\r\nMiddletown, N. Y. He is a member of Hoffman Lodge No. 412, F. and\r\nA. M., and served as foreman of Excelsior Hook and Ladder Company for\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nJOHN SCHOONMAKER, for nearly half a century the foremost dry goods\r\nmerchant in Orange County, was born in the town of Gardiner, Ulster\r\nCounty, N. Y., January 25, 1830, and died at his home in Newburgh,\r\nN. Y., January 1, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe Schoonmaker family is one of the oldest in this section of New\r\nYork State. The progenitor of the family in America was Hendrick\r\nJochemsen Schoonmaker, who came to America in 1654, in the military\r\nservice of the Dutch West India Company. The records show he loaned\r\nmoney to Governor Stuyvesant \"in time of need,\" and was active in the\r\nmilitary duties made necessary by the troublous times. His grandson,\r\nCaptain Frederick Schoonmaker, was one of the patriots and soldiers\r\nof the Revolution, who gave himself and his property to his country\r\nin its struggle for freedom from the British yoke.\r\n\r\nJohn A. Schoonmaker, father of the subject of this sketch, was a son\r\nof Major Abraham Schoonmaker of Revolutionary fame (Fourth Regiment,\r\nUlster County Militia). He married Rachel, eldest daughter of\r\nGustavis and Maria (Terwilliger) Sammons. Ten children were born to\r\nthem, of whom John was the tenth in order of birth. He was educated\r\nat Amenia Seminary, Dutchess County. He began work upon his father's\r\nfarm and continued until he was twenty-two, teaching school at\r\nGardiner for the last winter that he remained at home. In March,\r\n1852, with his brother Jacob, he opened a general store at\r\nTuttletown. Soon afterward his brother lost his life in the Henry\r\nClay disaster on the Hudson, and in a short time the Tuttletown store\r\nwas sold, Mr. Schoonmaker moving to Newburgh in the fall of 1853. His\r\nfirst employment was with Stephen Hayt, on Water street, for his\r\nboard. In three months he took a clerkship with Isaac Wood, Jr., for\r\nthree years, after which he had a position for a year with Mr.\r\nParmalee, and again returned to the store of Isaac Wood, Jr., where,\r\nunder Mr. Wood's guidance, he received and acquired experience that\r\nwas invaluable to him in later years.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Mr. Schoonmaker, with Samuel C. Mills and A. Y. Weiler,\r\npurchased the dry goods business of Colonel Wood, at the northeast\r\ncorner of Water and Third streets. They conducted business under the\r\nfirm name of Schoonmaker, Mills & Weiler. Half a dozen lines of boats\r\nbetween New York and Newburgh and market wagons from the surrounding\r\ncountry made Newburgh an active business center, where stores were\r\nopen as early as five o'clock in the morning and frequently as late\r\nas eleven o'clock at night. In 1878 the firm occupied its newly\r\ncompleted building at Nos. 94 and 96 Water street. This was\r\nconsidered a notable improvement and the firm even then had the\r\nlargest dry goods store in the city. Although at first only part of\r\nthe building was occupied, in a few years increased business made it\r\nnecessary to occupy the whole. Mr. Mills retired in 1885 and Mr.\r\nWeiler January 1, 1898. Mr. Schoonmaker's son, Samuel V., purchased\r\nMr. Weller's interest and the firm became John Schoonmaker & Son.\r\n\r\nNow the firm purchased the adjoining building on the north, still\r\nfurther increasing its capacity for business. Mr. Schoonmaker took\r\nan active interest in the affairs of the firm until his sudden\r\nillness in the latter part of 1902, and after a protracted period of\r\nhope and fear he died on January 1, 1904, at his home, 135 Grand\r\nstreet. He had thus been for many years the head of Newburgh's dry\r\ngoods trade. His business acquaintance was very extensive and few men\r\nenjoyed such a reputation for honor, integrity and probity, his\r\nfriends and acquaintances placing implicit confidence in him, which,\r\nthroughout his career, was never violated. He was a public spirited\r\ncitizen, always interested in the welfare and progress of Newburgh\r\nand contributed generously to projects which promised well for its\r\nadvancement, yet he never sought public office or cared to appear\r\nprominently in public. His increasing business prevented him from\r\nentering politics, although he was a member of the board of health\r\nfrom 1885 to 1888, in which he rendered conscientious service. He was\r\none of the organizers of the old Newburgh board of trade, and of its\r\nsuccessor, the Newburgh Business Men's Association, of which his son\r\nwas president. He earnestly aided by counsel and purse in the\r\nbuilding of the Palatine Hotel. For thirty-seven years he was a\r\ntrustee of the Newburgh Savings Bank and for a number of years its\r\nsecond vice-president. He was a member of the First Presbyterian\r\nChurch, in which he was active and efficient, serving for many terms\r\nas trustee and elder. He was also deeply interested in Bethel Mission\r\nand chapel, serving as superintendent of the chapel while health\r\npermitted. He was a member of the Holland Society of New York from\r\n1890 until the time of his death. He was married July 2, 1862, to\r\nMary A. Vail. The children of this marriage, Samuel V. Schoonmaker,\r\nMrs. W. Clement Scott and Miss Elizabeth M. Schoonmaker, are all\r\nresidents of Newburgh.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE D. SCHOONMAKER was born in the town of Crawford, in the\r\nCounty of Orange, on the 28th day of December, 1836. He was the only\r\nson of Levi Schoonmaker and Julia Ann, his wife. Levi was a son of\r\nEdward Schoonmaker and Leah Rose, his wife, both of the town of\r\nShawangunk, Ulster County, N. Y. Julia Ann was the daughter of Samuel\r\nButler and Sarah, his wife, both of the town of Goshen, Orange\r\nCounty, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch received a common school and academic\r\neducation, taught school in the counties of Chemung, Ulster and\r\nOrange for several years, was brought up a farmer, which occupation\r\nhe followed till January 1, 1868, when he was appointed by the then\r\nsurrogate, Honorable Gilbert O. Hulse, his brother-in-law, clerk of\r\nthe surrogate's court of the county of Orange, which position he has\r\noccupied ever since continuously, being appointed by the successive\r\nsurrogates to that office. He was stenographer to the surrogate's\r\ncourt from 1870 till the year 1903, and was also for several years\r\nassistant stenographer for the second judicial district of this\r\nstate, and also served as county court stenographer under County\r\nJudges Honorables Stephen W. Fullerton and Charles F. Brown, and also\r\nstenographer to the Dutchess County court under Honorables Henry M.\r\nTaylor and B. Platt Carpenter. In 1889 he was elected one of the\r\ntrustees of the village of Goshen, after a bitter and arduous\r\ncampaign, to which office he has been reelected for six terms of two\r\nyears each, without any opposition, and is now one of such trustees.\r\n\r\nHe has four children living, two having died in infancy: Anna\r\nFrances, wife of Thomas Mould, of the firm of Thompson & Mould;\r\nTheodore F., of Hartford, Conn., traveling salesman; Mary Adele, at\r\nhome, and Charles B., civil and construction engineer.\r\n\r\nANDREW SCHRIVER, residing on a farm near Chester, N.

At the time of his death, which occurred April 4,\r\n1907, he had occupied the same suite of offices in the Savings Bank\r\nBuilding for a period of thirty-five consecutive years.\r\n\r\nMr. Sterrit's practice was almost exclusively confined to equity and\r\nprobate work, in which he was an acknowledged expert. He conducted\r\nsome of the most important equity cases of recent years, and was\r\nemployed in the settlement of many large estates. His practice of his\r\nprofession was marked by untiring industry and strict integrity. He\r\nwas an eloquent speaker and a graceful writer, the productions of his\r\npen relating chiefly to local historical subjects, on which he was an\r\nacknowledged authority.\r\n\r\nMr. Sterrit was past master of Hudson River Lodge, F. & A.

This, in his life,\r\nserved to bring him his most cherished reward, and, in his death,\r\nwill prove his most enduring monument.\r\n\r\nDANIEL JACKSON STEWARD was the great-grandson of John Steward 1st,\r\nwho settled in Goshen in 1744, and the son of John Steward 3rd, who,\r\nborn in Goshen, subsequently moved to New York, where he was for\r\nforty years engaged in the business of a wholesale dry goods merchant,\r\nacquiring a fortune and distinguished by a reputation for unswerving\r\nintegrity and uprightness of character.\r\n\r\nDaniel Jackson Steward, the subject of this sketch, was the second\r\nson of John Steward 3rd, of Goshen, and was born in 1816. He was\r\ndescended, through his maternal ancestor, Isaac Townsend, of Oyster\r\nBay, L. I., from Capt.

He was never engaged\r\nin active business, but devoted the greater part of his life to\r\nscholarly pursuits. A fellow of the National Academy of Design, he\r\nwas himself an artist of merit, and delighted in his sketches and\r\npaintings, to depict the scenery characteristic of Orange County, in\r\nhis estimation, of unsurpassed beauty. Its graceful elms, giant oaks\r\nand chestnuts were his special study and admiration, and the reckless\r\ndestruction of the county's forests and groves, which during his\r\nlifetime he was obliged to witness, occasioned him the deepest regret\r\nfor economic and climatic reasons, even more than from the standpoint\r\nof the artist.\r\n\r\nMr. Steward was one of the incorporators and a patron of the\r\nMetropolitan Museum of Art, also of the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory, being first vice-president of the latter for many years. To\r\nthis museum he presented many fine fossils and Indian remains, some\r\nof which were found in Orange County, and also his collection of\r\nshells, he being a noted conchologist. This collection, though not\r\nthe largest, was said to contain rarer and more beautiful specimens\r\nthan any other private collection of shells in the world, and it can\r\nnow be seen intact in the museum.\r\n\r\nMr. Steward was widely interested in philanthropic and charitable\r\nenterprises. It may be mentioned that he was instrumental in sending\r\nto Japan in 1858, and personally supported there for five years, the\r\nfamous missionary, Dr. Verbeck, to whose influence with the emperor\r\nis largely attributed the awakening of Japan, hitherto closed to the\r\nworld, and its opening to western civilization.\r\n\r\nEDWIN F.

Y., is a lineal descendant of\r\nthe colonist, Robert Taft, who came from England to Massachusetts in\r\n1677. He is the oldest son of Daniel Taft, the sixth in line of\r\ndescent from the colonist Robert and his wife Emeline Smith,\r\ndescendant of a family of Pennsylvania Quakers who, escaping the\r\nmassacre at Wyoming, settled near Woodbury Falls in Orange County.\r\n\r\nCaptain Taft was born in the town of Cornwall, September 28, 1840;\r\nwas educated in the A. C. Roe Collegiate School at Cornwall, and at\r\nthe outbreak of the Civil War was engaged in the building business\r\nwith his father and brother-in-law, C. H. Mead. In response to\r\nLincoln's appeal for three hundred thousand additional volunteers, he\r\nenlisted as a private in Company C, 124th Regiment, New York\r\nVolunteers, and in recognition of ability, fortitude and bravery\r\ndisplayed in camp, on the march and in battle, was promoted from\r\ngrade to grade to the captaincy of his company.\r\n\r\nIn the desperate charge of the 124th at Devil's Den on the field of\r\nGettysburg, in which Colonel Ellis, Major Cromwell and so many of his\r\nbrave comrades were killed, he was disabled by wounds received at the\r\nmost advanced point readied, and was captured by the enemy. Four\r\nmonths later he had been exchanged and was again on duty with his\r\nregiment. With the exception of these and the battle of Boydton Road,\r\nhe was never absent from the 124th when it was under fire.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, the year after the close of the war, Captain Taft engaged in\r\nthe building business with his brother-in-law, Charles H.

The building operations of\r\nthe firm have extended from Northern New Hampshire to San Antonio,\r\nTexas.

Immediately on assuming office he put\r\nin operation a system of road improvement which in less than two\r\nyears gave to Cornwall the reputation of having the best streets of\r\nany village in the county. Under a changed administration the\r\ntaxpayers soon became dissatisfied, Captain Taft was petitioned to\r\nagain stand for president, and in 1891 was elected without\r\nopposition, serving until 1895.\r\n\r\nRealizing that the natural beauties of the Highlands of the Hudson\r\nwere at last awakening public interest, Captain Taft began several\r\nyears ago, as opportunity offered, the purchase of lands in the\r\nStorm King region, where he now owns several rather extensive tracts,\r\nwhich it is believed will at no distant day be so improved as to\r\nenhance the attractiveness of his native town.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1881 to Mary G., eldest daughter of Dr. James E.\r\nKnapp, of Marlborough, Ulster County, N.

It is\r\nwild and beautiful still, though the mills have been running there\r\nmore than a century, and the Erie trains through the valley for\r\nsixty-six years.\r\n\r\nNearly two hundred years, with their attendant changes, have passed\r\nover that region since Isaac Van Duser--the first white man to settle\r\nin the Ramapo Pass--came from Tappan and located with his family in\r\nthe \"Throat of the Cloff,\" as that narrow part of the valley was then\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nHe bought four hundred acres that John Van Blarcum had recently\r\npurchased of the Indians, and there built his homestead. East and\r\nwest rose the mountains densely wooded, and the narrow valley was\r\nfilled with the music of the little river. Here, he lived in the\r\nmidst of the forest, the Indians his only neighbors, and began his\r\nwork of opening up the Pass, which proved to be the natural entrance\r\nto the Orange County of to-day.\r\n\r\nHis son, Isaac, Jr., and his wife, were living there in 1724. Isaac,\r\nJr., afterward purchased the Van Gelder tract which joined the Van\r\nDuser land, and extended northward. When he came in possession of his\r\nfather's land, he became owner of the whole valley from the Romopock\r\nline below Ramapo to Stony Brook, north of Sloatsburg.\r\n\r\nHe was living there with a large family just at the time the present\r\nOrange County was being settled, principally by people from Southern\r\nOrange County--now Rockland. As the young settlers came up through\r\nthe Pass, Isaac Van Duser was able to supply each one with a wife\r\nuntil his ten daughters were all married. They were the maternal\r\nancestors of many old Orange County families.\r\n\r\nWieberch married Benjamin Demarest. Agnes married Samuel Sidman, to\r\nwhom Isaac Van Duzer deeded the original homestead--the Van Blarcum\r\ntract.

In 1772 he divided this land equally among\r\nthe three. The whole family appear to have been living on the patent\r\nduring the Revolution. Erskine's map, made for General Washington's\r\nuse, shows the location of Van Duzer's house at Cornwall. His son,\r\nIsaac, Jr., had sons, Isaac 3rd, Adolphus and Benjamin. Alexander Van\r\nDuser, of Gardiner, N. Y., is a descendant of Isaac 3rd, and Letitia\r\nMills. Adolphus moved to Sullivan County.

He\r\nwas at Fort Montgomery at different times, served at Haverstraw,\r\nRamapo and in the Jerseys, at New Windsor, Butter Hill, Nicolls Point\r\nand eight weeks at Fishkill. He was stationed at West Point\r\nimmediately after Arnold's treason was discovered. He was described\r\nby his neighbors as \"an ardent, zealous Whig.\" He married first\r\nJuliana Strong, who left one child, the wife of Jacob Mandeville.\r\nTheir daughter married first Nathaniel DuBois Woodhull, second Joseph\r\nYoung.\r\n\r\nCaptain Van Duzer married second Juliana Tusten, sister of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Tusten, who was killed at Minisink. In 1807 they\r\nmoved to Warwick, having purchased the farm where the fourth\r\ngeneration of their descendants now live.\r\n\r\nThey had sons Isaac, Benjamin Tusten, William, John and Selah and six\r\ndaughters, Elizabeth, Ann, Mary and Susan were the wives of Selah\r\nReeve, Nathan Wescott, Ebenezer Crissey and John Dolson,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nChristopher's son Isaac was prominent in business at Cornwall.\r\nAfterward located in Warwick, where his grand-daughter, Mary Burt,\r\nnow lives.

At this old homestead on April 25, 1907, was celebrated the\r\none hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Van Duzer family in\r\nWarwick.\r\n\r\nShadrack Van Duzer lived in Cornwall during the Revolution. His two\r\nsons, Isaac and Henry, served in Captain Van Duzer's company. Henry's\r\ngrandson, 'Squire Henry Van Duzer, of Cornwall, still lives on a part\r\nof the land bought by Isaac Van Duzer in 1748, and has the original\r\npatent in his possession.\r\n\r\nShadrack is supposed to be a descendant of Isaac of Ramapo, though\r\nno proof can as yet be found. On the other hand, several\r\ngrandchildren of his son Isaac, who married Martha Tusten and moved\r\nto Goshen, claim that Shadrack came from Holland when his son Isaac\r\nwas twelve years of age, that is, 1767. This may be true, as no\r\nrecord of him in Cornwall or elsewhere has been found prior to that\r\ndate, though I have searched for it during the past ten years and\r\nwill now leave the question to his descendants, who are very numerous\r\nin Orange County, to determine for themselves.\r\n\r\nIsaac Van Duzer, of Ramapo, was a grandson of Abraham Pietersen Van\r\nDeursen, the original ancestor of the Van Dusen and Van Duzer\r\nfamilies in America. We find him mentioned first in a Holland\r\ndocument complaining of the English, which says: \"They encroach\r\nwesterly below Cape Cod, on the Dutch limits, absorbing Rhode Island\r\nand Martin's Vineyard, howbeit possession had been taken thereof for\r\nthis Company in 1636 by Abraham Pietersen Van Deursen.\"\r\n\r\nHe was the miller of New Amsterdam in 1638, one of the \"Twelve Men\"\r\nin 1641, was afterward elected one of the \"Eight Men,\" and was also a\r\nBurgher. In 1664 he took the oath of Allegiance to England.\r\n\r\nHENRY VAN DUZER, justice of the peace of the town of Cornwall,\r\nresides on a farm near Cornwall Station.

WARING was born at Balmville, a suburb of Newburgh, in\r\n1852. He read law with Judge Hirschberg, and was admitted to the bar\r\nin 1873. Later he formed a partnership with ex-District Attorney\r\nRussel Headley, which continued until 1878, when Mr. Waring was\r\nelected recorder of the city of Newburgh. He was re-elected in 1882\r\nand again in 1886, retiring from office December 31, 1890. He served\r\nas corporation counsel of the city of Newburgh continuously from\r\n1892, resigning the office February, 1907.\r\n\r\nMr. Waring is a director and attorney for many of Orange County's\r\nleading corporations. He is a member of the City Club, Powelton Club\r\nand Republican Club of the city of New York. Mr. Waring is unmarried\r\nand resides at the Palatine Hotel.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SAYER WATKINS was born on the homestead farm in the town of\r\nHamptonburgh, August 3, 1820, and the date of his death was November\r\n7, 1884. He was an energetic farmer, and lived for his neighbors as\r\nwell as himself, winning their respect and esteem by his kindly and\r\nthoughtful interest in their welfare. He married Miss Emma Monell, of\r\nHamptonburgh, September 15, 1859, and their three children are all\r\nliving. Juliana B. was born July 12, 1860, and is the wife of B.\r\nSeward Carr, of Chicago; William Sayer, born November 7, 1866, lives\r\non the homestead; John Evans, born December 25, 1867, married Anna\r\nEliza Blake, March 9, 1905, and they have two daughters, Elizabeth,\r\nwho was born January 2, 1906, and Emma Adeline, born October 1, 1907.\r\nThe house on the homestead was burned in 1886, and rebuilt in 1887.\r\n\r\nJ. N. WEED was born in the hamlet of Gardnertown, town of Newburgh,\r\nNovember 20, 1825. He has always resided in the town, except when\r\naway at school. On April 1, 1833, the family moved from Orange Lake\r\nto North Newburgh on the west bank of the Hudson River, three and\r\none-half miles north of the village of Newburgh. It was found to be a\r\nbeautiful location, back from a fine sandy beach just far enough to\r\nescape the highest tides, with a bay extending seven or eight miles\r\nin front bounded by the mountains of the Highlands. April 1, 1833,\r\nwas one of the loveliest days imaginable and the house had been\r\nreached by a road coming down from a hill, five hundred feet high, in\r\nnumerous zig-zags. Such hills were new to the life of our subject, as\r\nalso was the river bay and the river craft and naturally made an\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nThis continued to be the home of Mr. Weed until May, 1845, when he\r\ncame to the village as a clerk of the Highland Bank. He left that\r\nbank, of which he was then teller, in January, 1852, having been\r\nappointed cashier of the Quassaick Bank, then organizing. Mr. Weed\r\nwas cashier of the latter bank during its entire history and of the\r\nQuassaick National Bank of Newburgh, into which it was converted May\r\n1, 1865, until February 4, 1895, when he was elected president and\r\nnow holds that position.\r\n\r\nThe principal business events of his life have been given heretofore\r\nin the local histories. There is, however, a side to the life of this\r\nman but little known, and we propose to say something about it.\r\n\r\nAs an amateur geologist he has thoroughly explored the territory\r\nabout Newburgh, a region rich in glacial and drift phenomena.\r\n\r\nScattered over its surface are huge blue sandstone boulders, some of\r\nextraordinary size and sure to attract the attention of even the\r\nun-observing. They are generally, but not always, scattered in\r\n_groups._\r\n\r\nAt the time of the publication of the Natural History of New York, in\r\n1843, these and other boulders were supposed to have been transported\r\nfrom their source to their present place in icebergs, the glacial\r\ntheory at that time being undreamed of. Now it can safely be declared\r\nestablished and readily explains many things involved in obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe glacial markings in the Hudson River valley are found from the\r\npresent surface of the water up to the mountain tops and afford an\r\nindex of some of the conditions existing on the earth at that time.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: a surface now polished must have been a surface when\r\nthe glacier did that work. There are glacial polishings very near\r\nNewburgh at the river surface and they also are found on the top of\r\nthe Palisades, a trap rock thrown up from below in a molten state at\r\nsome remote period of the earth's history. How long ago cannot be\r\ntold, but this can be confidently said, the catastrophe of the\r\nPalisades antedated their being polished by the ice of the Great\r\nGlacier. The polished slate rocks at the surface of the present river\r\nshow that the river valley then existed and that the Palisades were\r\nthen, also, a geological feature of the region, as the footprints of\r\nthe same artisan is left on both.\r\n\r\nOur subject was attracted by the size and numbers of these blue stone\r\nboulders about Newburgh, and persevered in an attempt to ascertain\r\nfrom whence they came until success finally crowned his efforts with\r\nthe sure conclusion that their source was the Marlborough Mountains,\r\nand that the explanation of their being found in groups was that they\r\ncame from the precipitous cliffs of the mountains from which they\r\nwere detached by the action of frost and gravity, and falling upon\r\nthe ice were slowly transported by it until the ice melted and\r\ndropped its burden at the places where now found. The same natural\r\nforces continuing to act, at long intervals the falls from the cliffs\r\nwould recur, the rocks take up their journey in the moving ice and\r\nfind their resting place where the ice melted, and the direction and\r\ndistance of these groups from the source would afford some clue to\r\nthe movements of the glacier itself.\r\n\r\nSome of these boulders are found as far south as Central Valley, and\r\nsome high up on the slopes of the Cornwall Highlands, as high even as\r\none thousand feet. Two professional geologists have gone over this\r\nground with Mr. Weed and confirmed his conclusions. The basement\r\nwalls of the Imperial Flats in South street and the stone wall built\r\nby B. Franklin Clark on the east side of the highway to Woodlawn\r\nCemetery are of big boulder origin. Specimens of other drift rocks\r\nhave been found near Newburgh and traced to their source as far north\r\nas fifty miles.\r\n\r\nA more interesting subject, however, to Mr. Weed, is the Aurora\r\nBorealis. In the cold winter of 1837, a chum of his brother was\r\nvisiting at the house and in the early part of the evening had\r\nstarted for home, but almost immediately came running back and in a\r\nterrified manner declared \"Granny Theall's barn is on fire!\" The\r\nentire household rushed to the door and confronted a scene that was\r\nindeed alarming. The landscape was covered with snow, the snow was\r\nas red as blood and the air filled with flames. The brother and his\r\nchum ran for half a mile toward Granny Theall's barn to find when it\r\ncame into view that it was not the barn but the world that was on\r\nfire, at least that was the impression of most of the persons who saw\r\nthis extraordinary display of the Aurora Borealis, the flames seemed\r\nso real and the danger so imminent. It made such an impression on Mr.\r\nWeed that ever since he has been a student and observer of the\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nDuring the sun spot maximum of 1868-1873 the Aurora occurred so\r\nfrequently that in May, 1871, he resolved to keep a close nightly\r\nwatch and record of his observations, and this he kept up for seven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn the first four months of observation forty-four Auroras were seen\r\nby Mr. Weed. The whole number of days on which Auroras were seen in\r\nthe whole United States other than Newburgh was sixty-eight, and the\r\nlargest number reported from any one place was twenty-five, from\r\nDuluth; followed by seventeen from Chicago, sixteen from Marquette,\r\nfifteen from Boston, fourteen from Grand Haven, fourteen from Oswego,\r\ntwelve from Davenport, ten from Buffalo, ten from Burlington, nine\r\nfrom Detroit, eight from Rochester, nine from St. Paul, seven from\r\nMount Washington, six from Cleveland, six from Milwaukee, six from\r\nToledo, three from Indianapolis, New London and Portland, Me., each,\r\ntwo from New York, and one each from Cape May, Cheyenne, Escanala,\r\nLeavenworth, San Francisco, St. Louis, Washington, D. C, and\r\nWilmington.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention is called to the number reported at New York, only\r\nsixty miles south of Newburgh, due in part no doubt to the artificial\r\nlights of the great city.\r\n\r\nOne hundred years ago auroras were regarded as most abundant near the\r\npoles, and as very rare in our latitude, but we now know that they\r\nare most brilliant and probably most numerous in the medial zones\r\nbetween the poles and the equator, that is in _the zones of the earth\r\nhaving the greatest diurnal range of temperature,_ say, in the\r\ntemperate zones on their polar sides.\r\n\r\nMr. Weed has been led by his observations to believe that the\r\nphenomenon is purely meteorological. In support of this view he has\r\nwitnessed many a time the aurora on the top of the clouds, and in one\r\ninstance on the top of a detached rain-cloud going southeast, the\r\nexistence of which was brought to his attention by the rain falling\r\nupon him. It was then noticed that the cloud was surmounted by a fine\r\ndisplay of auroral streamers physically connected with it and\r\ndirected toward the coronal point.\r\n\r\nThe three features, cloud, rain and streamers, kept on together to\r\nthe horizon, affording the best possible conditions for establishing\r\ntheir physical connection. In connection with this there occurred\r\nanother remarkable appearance and standing alone among his many cloud\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nWhen the auroral rain-cloud reached the mountains, on the area where\r\nthe rain fell the mountains were covered by an exceedingly brilliant\r\nwhite fog blanket, conforming to all the irregular forms of the\r\nslopes and passing when the cloud passed. During the same evening a\r\nlittle later heavy showers occurred, the clouds going in the same\r\ndirection, and in the inter-cloud spaces auroral streamers were\r\nabundant, but the openings were not large enough to determine their\r\nphysical connection with the clouds, but taken in connection with the\r\npreceding cloud there can hardly be a doubt but that the same\r\nrelation existed between the rain, cloud and streamers.\r\n\r\nOn two different occasions a gleam of lightning appeared in the\r\nmiddle of the dark segment north, half way between the horizon and\r\nthe crown of the segment, and in both cases, instantly, there rose\r\nfrom that identical spot a single fine auroral streamer. The apparent\r\nphysical connection in these two cases is supported by the fact that\r\nthe streamers usually have their origin in the arch of light\r\nsurmounting the dark segment; that they do not ordinarily appear\r\nsingly even there, and that in a long experience our observer does\r\nnot remember ever having seen a single lonely streamer originate in\r\nthe dark-segment. Quite frequently sheet lightning is seen in the\r\nsouth with an aurora in the north, and sometimes both are seen\r\ntogether in the north, but they never seemed physically connected,\r\nexcept in these two instances. The fact that both of these gleams had\r\nthe same position in the dark-segment, and were both instantly\r\nfollowed by the rare eruption of a single streamer would seem to\r\nremove the phenomenon from the possibility of having been a\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion during a great aurora which lasted the whole night\r\nand out into the full twilight of the morning, another observation\r\nwas made tending to show kinship of the aurora with meteorology.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us mention that the crowning glory of the aurora and its\r\nhighest point is regarded as the corona, a point just south of the\r\nzenith toward which all of the streamers converge when the aurora has\r\npassed further to the south. Several times the corona formed under\r\nthe clouds during the night of this great exhibition, a singular\r\nfeature of the phenomenon being the invisibility of the clouds except\r\nwhen illuminated by the light of the corona. The clouds were\r\ncirro-stratus going rapidly southeast. They were specially looked for\r\nat other times, but could not be seen. Does not this prove that the\r\nwhole of a first-class aurora was within the cloud-bearing regions of\r\nthe atmosphere? Its highest part was below the clouds, and therefore\r\nit was below the clouds in its entirety. It was a great aurora, as\r\nshown by the repeated formation of the corona. It was a great aurora\r\nalso because it continued through the entire night into the morning\r\ntwilight and it suggests a meteorological origin.\r\n\r\nAnother appearance occurring occasionally during an aurora is the\r\n\"Luminous White Cloud Band\" crossing the sky from east to west,\r\ncutting the horizon about east and some north of west, and when fully\r\nformed crossing the meridian near the coronal point. Our observer has\r\nseen this arch a number of times and regards it as one of the most\r\ninstructive features of the aurora. Some observers have doubted its\r\nconnection with the Aurora Borealis, but Mr. Weed does not share in\r\nthis doubt, he having, on April 13, 1871, witnessed its entire\r\nformation, and having seen the most convincing evidence of its\r\nconnection with the aurora. This is what he saw: At 10 P. M. a dark\r\nsegment north by east crowned with the ordinary auroral arc of light\r\nand with streamers above this; in other words, an Aurora Borealis.\r\nThen another segment of seventy degrees altitude of the most\r\nfascinating, bright, attractive luminosity, bounded by a perfectly\r\nsharp outline. The sky was cloudless throughout, and south of this\r\nline, of normal hue. The perfection of the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the normal and auroral sky was a most extraordinary thing,\r\nand it teaches this, that the aurora had a clearly defined and\r\ndefinite border on its advancing side. Then, in this cloudless sky,\r\nstreamers-like cloudlets began to form on the upper side of this line\r\nin the normal sky at both the east and west horizon, rapidly\r\nsucceeded by others until they met on or near the meridian completing\r\na white cloud band. The base of these cloud-streamers blended\r\ntogether on the curved line and were pointed above and directed\r\ntoward the coronal point of the aurora. After the band was completed\r\nit was noticed that it was moving south and this motion continued\r\nuntil it came to rest at the star Delta Leonis in the region of the\r\ncoronal point of the ordinary auroral exhibitions. As the cloud arch\r\nmoved south from its initial point it brightened into an intense\r\nluminosity, was much agitated internally, and showed a motion to the\r\nwest, as it always does, and, in dissolving, showed a wavelet\r\nstructure and cloud-like aspect.\r\n\r\nHalf of the journey of the band was made before the line separating\r\nthe base of the cloud-arch and the auroral sky was in the least\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThat this cloud arch formed on and moved with the luminous auroral\r\nsegment on its journey and rested at the coronal point proves it to\r\nbe auroral, and the formation of this luminous cloud in contact with\r\nthe aurora, in an otherwise cloudless sky, also proves the close\r\nrelationship of the aurora and clouds and here bring in actual\r\ncontact with cloud, that the aurora was in the cloud bearing region\r\nof the atmosphere, and again suggests a meteorological paternity for\r\nthe Aurora Borealis.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN WELCH, of Little York, Orange County, was born October 11,\r\n1832. His parents were Gabriel and Eliza Welch, and they had nine\r\nchildren, three of whom are living--Benjamin; Susan, wife of Martin\r\nV. B. Horton, of Warwick; and Mary, wife of Edsal Stage. Benjamin\r\nlearned the carpenter's trade when he was twenty years of age, and\r\nfollowed that occupation several years. He was connected with the\r\nBrown & Bailey Creameries of Amity and Edenville five years. On March\r\n1, 1871, he removed to Pleasant Valley and managed his father's farm\r\nuntil the death of the latter, when he became its owner. To this he\r\nadded by purchase the Rynear Stage farm of one hundred and twenty-six\r\nacres, which increases his lands to two hundred and sixty acres. He\r\nhas a large dairy, and is one of the extensive peach growers in\r\nOrange County.\r\n\r\nJuly 9, 1863, he married Miss Mary E. Davenport, of Warwick. Their\r\nthree children, all living, are George, born March 26, 1864; Olive,\r\nborn October 8, 1865, and Daniel, born January 22, 1867. George was\r\nmarried to Mary F. Feagles, of Pine Island, December 31, 1904. The\r\nfather was an Odd Fellow many years. His homestead farm has belonged\r\nto the family since 1844.\r\n\r\nALANSON Y. WELLER, president of the Newburgh Planing Mill Co., was\r\nborn in the town of Crawford, Orange County, N. Y., in 1837. He was\r\neducated at Montgomery Academy, and in 1857 became a clerk in the\r\nstore of the late A. K. Chandler, Newburgh, where he remained until\r\n1863, when the dry goods firm of Schoonmaker, Mills & Weller was\r\nformed. In 1886 Mr. Mills retired from the firm and the two remaining\r\nmembers continued the business until January 1, 1898, when the\r\npartnership was dissolved, Mr. Weller retiring from a mercantile\r\ncareer which had proved very successful. In 1899 Mr. Weller succeeded\r\nto the planing mill business of Thomas Shaw's Sons, which was\r\nestablished in 1837, and which is among the important industries of\r\nthe city. Mr. Weller is a director of the National Bank of Newburgh,\r\ntrustee of the Newburgh Savings Bank, and interested in many local\r\nenterprises. Much of his time has been occupied in managing the\r\nestate of his deceased brother, Joseph H. Weller.\r\n\r\nGEORGE S. WELLER, wholesale and retail coal dealer of Newburgh, was\r\nborn in that city July, 1871, and is a son of A. Y. Weller. He\r\ngraduated from the academy in 1888 and entered the employ of J. W.\r\nMatthews & Co., with whom he remained as shipping clerk until he\r\nstarted his present business in 1890. He is also president of the\r\nHighland Drug Co. Mr. Weller married Miss Constance, daughter of Rev.\r\nJ. A. Farrar.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH H. WELLER, a prominent merchant of New York City, was born in\r\nMontgomery, Orange County, in 1846, and died at his home in New York,\r\nNovember 14, 1886. At the age of fourteen he came to Newburgh to\r\nclerk in the dry goods firm of A. K. Chandler & Co. He went to New\r\nYork in 1868 to become salesman for the firm of Wentz, Hartley & Co.,\r\nafterward becoming a member of the firm of J. M. Wentz & Co. He\r\nremained a member of this firm until its dissolution. In 1879 he\r\nbecame member of the firm of Teffts, Griswold & Co., and three years\r\nlater of the new firm of Tefft, Weller & Co., wholesale dry goods\r\nmerchants of New York. In 1876 Mr. Weller married Miss Frances\r\nCronkright, of Elizabeth, N. J., whose death occurred five weeks\r\nprior to that of her husband. The loss of his beloved wife prostrated\r\nMr. Weller with grief and contributed largely to his death. Mr.\r\nWeller is buried in the family plot at Woodlawn Cemetery.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Weller left surviving four children, Lillian C. Weller,\r\nwho is now the wife of Ralph S. Tompkins, of Fishkill-on-Hudson,\r\nN. Y.; Edith M. Weller, who is the wife of Mr. Leonard M. Hills, of\r\nNew York City; Alfred E. Weller, who resides in Newburgh, N. Y.; and\r\nJoseph Francis Weller, who is a student at Yale University.\r\n\r\nThe New York Dry Goods Chronicle of November 20, 1886, paid the\r\nfollowing tribute to the memory of Mr. Weller:\r\n\r\n\"His sudden death has created a profound feeling of grief and sorrow,\r\nnot only throughout the dry goods trade in which he was so prominent,\r\nbut to all commercial circles in this great commercial city. Seldom\r\nhas a man so young been so universally mourned. He left his impress\r\non the trade and commerce of the metropolis. He did this by the force\r\nof his ability, his energy and affability. He was a superior man in\r\nbusiness and in the charm and gentleness of his manner. His judgment\r\nwas sound, his executive ability rare, his energy wonderful, and his\r\nmastery of details complete. He possessed to an eminent degree the\r\nqualities of a great merchant. He was ambitious but not at the\r\nexpense of others. He was helpful--never harmful. In his ascent to\r\nsuccess and distinction he never crowded others from the path but\r\nrather encouraged them with sympathy and cheer. His crowning glory\r\nwas his charity, his kindness. It shone in the family, in the social\r\ncircle, at the store and elsewhere that business duties called him.\r\n\r\n\"In the brief career of Joseph H. Weller there is the history of a\r\nbusy life. It was not length of days that gave him opportunity to\r\nrise, it was what he did and how he did it that gave him prominence.\r\nHe acted nobly and well his part.\"\r\n\r\nTHEODORE A. WELLER, retired merchant of Middletown, N. Y., was born\r\nin the town of Wallkill, Orange County. He was educated at the\r\ndistrict schools and Middletown Academy. His dry goods career in\r\nMiddletown began with a clerkship for the firm of Hayt & Adams. At\r\nthe end of six years he purchased Mr. Hayt's interest, and the firm\r\nof Adams & Weller was formed in 1876, which continued ten years. This\r\nwas succeeded by Weller, Demarest & Swayze, and in 1888 the\r\nwell-known store of Weller & Demarest was established, which\r\ncontinued until January, 1908, when Mr. Weller's health caused him to\r\nretire from active business.\r\n\r\nMr. Weller is prominently identified with the Masonic fraternity,\r\nincluding membership in Hoffman Lodge, Midland Chapter, Cypress\r\nCommandery and Mecca Temple of the Mystic Shrine.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN JOSEPH WELLES, an artist, for twenty-six years a resident of\r\nGreenwood Lake, has taken a deep interest in its legendary history.\r\nHis wife Annie Estelle is a daughter of the late Professor Henri\r\nAppy, of Rochester, N. Y. the distinguished violinist and teacher,\r\nwho at the age of twelve years graduated with the highest honors of\r\nany pupil from the Royal Conservatory of Amsterdam, Holland. He was\r\ngiven a laurel wreath decoration by William of Orange, grandfather of\r\nWilhelmena, the present Queen of Holland. Some years after the death\r\nof Jean Appy, who conducted the King's Orchestra, his son Henri Appy\r\nsucceeded to the position. He later came to America and played with\r\nJenny Lind in concerts at Castle Garden, and the piano owned and used\r\nby her is now in the Welles home at Greenwood Lake. Professor Appy\r\nmade many concert tours, conducted the orchestra at the old Niblo\r\nGarden in Newport, and taught at the Convent of the Sacred Heart. His\r\nwife was Annie Paine, a singer at Grace Church, N. Y. He later moved\r\nto Rochester, N. Y., to conduct the Philharmonic Society there. Two\r\nchildren survive him, Annie E. and Ernest Frederic, professor of\r\nmusic in the college at Xenia and Granville, the latter of Newark,\r\nOhio. He is a musician and teacher of marked ability and has\r\npurchased land and expects to reside permanently at Greenwood Lake.\r\nHenri Appy died in Rochester, N. Y., November 16, 1903, at the age of\r\nseventy-nine.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WELLING was born April 28, 1864, on the homestead farm at\r\nWarwick, N. Y., which has been in the family continuously for one\r\nhundred and fifty-four years. His early education was obtained at the\r\nWarwick High School and Polytechnic Institute at Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\nAfter his schooling he returned to Warwick and took the management of\r\nthe farm where he has since resided. He married Marie L. Van Duzer,\r\nof Warwick, May 17, 1893, daughter of James Harvey and Sarah (Taylor)\r\nVan Duzer. Their one son, Thomas, Jr., was born April 3, 1896. Mr.\r\nWelling is a director of the First National Bank, second\r\nvice-president of the Warwick Savings Bank and is a trustee of the\r\nWarwick Cemetery Association. He is identified with the Grange and\r\nattends the Dutch Reformed Church of Warwick. His father, Thomas\r\nWelling, was one of Warwick's representative men. He took an active\r\ninterest in matters pertaining to the town, was a director in the\r\nFirst National Bank and the Warwick Savings Bank and served as\r\npresident of the Warwick Valley Milk Association. He died November 9,\r\n1898.\r\n\r\nJAMES EDWARD WELLS was born at Dingmans, Pa., in 1834, and died\r\nsuddenly at his home in Goshen, May 6, 1907. He married Miss Francis\r\nE., daughter of William S. and Sarah T. (Wood) Conkling. He removed\r\nfrom the farm to the village of Goshen in 1901, and lived a retired\r\nlife until his death. For years he was a director and superintendent\r\nof grounds of the Orange County Agricultural Society, and was one of\r\nthe first members of the Goshen Grange. He was agent in New York and\r\nJersey City for the Orange County Farmers' Milk Company, a director\r\nof the Milk Exchange, and a partner in the firm of Wells & Stage,\r\nmilk commission merchants, with offices in New York. In religion he\r\nwas a Presbyterian and in politics a republican. In 1894 he was\r\nelected supervisor of Goshen, and was afterward re-elected twelve\r\ntimes, which shows the confidence which his townsmen reposed in him.\r\nHe was the descendant of William Wells, who emigrated to America in\r\n1635, whose father was the Rev. William Wells, rector of St. Peter's\r\nChurch at Norwich, England. His widow and two children survive him.\r\nThe son is William A. Wells, of the Goshen National Bank, and the\r\ndaughter Mrs. Cornelius Christie, of Watertown, N. Y. James Edward's\r\nfather, Alfred, was a native of Goshen, and his mother, Lydia W.\r\nNyce, was a Pennsylvanian.\r\n\r\nFREDERICK WILLIAM WENZEL, assistant postmaster, Newburgh, N. Y., is a\r\nson of George C. and Elizabeth A. Wenzel, and was born in Newburgh,\r\nSeptember 28, 1871. In 1890 he graduated with honors from the\r\nacademy; and in 1895 succeeded his father in the manufacture of plain\r\nand fancy boxes. He was appointed to his present position March 1,\r\n1900. Mr. Wenzel was master of Newburgh Lodge No. 309, F. and A. M.,\r\nin 1899 and 1900; a trustee of Highland Chapter No. 52, R. A. M.;\r\nmember of Ringgold Hose Company No. 1; a member of St. George's\r\nChurch, and the Alumni of Newburgh Free Academy.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL CHARLES H. WEYGANT, ex-mayor of Newburgh, N. Y., was born in\r\nCornwall, July 8, 1839, and educated at Ashland and Claverack\r\nCollegiate Institutes. In 1862 he was appointed senior captain of the\r\n124th Regiment, N. Y. S. V., commanding Company A. He took active\r\npart in every general engagement of the Army of the Potomac. At the\r\nBattle of Gettysburg his superior officers were killed, leaving the\r\nregiment in command of Captain Weygant. He was shortly after\r\ncommissioned major and July 2, 1863, was made lieutenant-colonel. In\r\n1870 Colonel Weygant was elected sheriff of Orange County, and from\r\n1878 to 1880 he served as mayor of the city of Newburgh. In 1886, in\r\ncompany with Henry T. McCoun, he purchased and developed the property\r\nnow known as Washington Heights, Newburgh. He is trustee of Trinity\r\nM. E. Church; ex-commander of Ellis Post, G. A.

Y., and is the father of six\r\nchildren, all of whom are living: William F. Wheeler, Jr., Charles\r\nV., Jesse I., Mary A., Roe W., and Ralph. The loss of his father at\r\nthe age of sixteen necessitated his leaving school at an early age\r\nand assuming the responsibilities of the farm, on which he now\r\nresides. Mr. Wheeler is an ardent republican. Five generations have\r\nlived upon the estate now owned by him, it having been in the name\r\nfor over one hundred years. The property, consisting of two hundred\r\nand eighty-five acres, is at present known as Peach Grove Farm. The\r\nhouse in which he and his family reside was built by Colonel William\r\nF.

In 1891 Mr. Whitehead was chosen president and\r\nthe success of the industry since that time has been rapid. It is\r\ninteresting to note that he is the only member of the original\r\ncompany now identified with this establishment, and his official\r\nconnection with the cutlery industry stretches over a longer period\r\nthan any other man connected with the business at the present time in\r\nthis Sheffield of America.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitehead also occupies a prominent position in social and\r\neducational circles. In 1893 he was chosen school trustee and in 1896\r\npresident of the board of education, which position he held until his\r\nresignation in 1905. He is a director in the National Bank of Walden\r\nand of the Walden Savings Bank.

Endowed by nature with nobility of character,\r\nwith an artistic love for beauty, educated in the school of life's\r\nactivities by hard study and with the polish of extensive travel his\r\nwas a versatile and attractive personality.\r\n\r\nA patriot, he ever listened to the calls of his fellows to serve them\r\nas a public-spirited Christian citizen. For many years he was the\r\npresident of his well-beloved Warwick village, which owes, in large\r\nmeasure, the present beauty of its homes, its churches, its Red Swan\r\nInn, as well as its increasing popularity as a resort, to Mr.\r\nWisner's interest and efforts. His favorite pastimes were shooting,\r\nsketching and driving.\r\n\r\nMr. Wisner married Martha, daughter of the late Thomas Welling and\r\nCaroline Van Duzer, in October, 1879, and he was survived by his\r\nwidow and his children, Mrs. Burton J.

The old Wisner homestead\r\nis located about one mile north of Bellvale, Orange County, and a\r\npicture of this historic house will be found on another page of this\r\nvolume. It was built before the Revolutionary War by William Wisner,\r\none of four sons of Captain John Wisner, Jr. William Wisner died in\r\nthis house in 1803, and his son, William Roe Wisner, who succeeded to\r\nthe ownership of the farm, and other property by inheritance, was\r\nborn in this house and lived there continuously until his death at\r\nthe age of eighty-seven years. Few men in Orange County were better\r\nknown and none were more highly respected than Mr. Wisner. He was\r\nprogressive and liberal-minded. His son, whose name heads this\r\nsketch, obtained his early education at the district school, two\r\nwinters at the private school of the learned John K. Joline in\r\nWarwick, and at Chester Academy, of which William Bross was\r\nprincipal. He organized and taught a class in physiology, of which\r\nour subject was a member. This was probably the first teaching of\r\nphysiology outside the medical profession.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1844 he entered the university at East Hampton,\r\nMass., where he remained until the fall of 1845, when he commenced\r\nlecturing on anatomy, physiology, hygiene and phrenology in the New\r\nEngland States. He went to Ohio in 1846, and for five years lectured\r\nin the west on his favorite subjects, introducing physiology in\r\nschools. His then new subjects, his quaint and original style of\r\npresenting them, together with his marvelous faculty of delineating\r\nhuman character, drew immense audiences, crowning his efforts with\r\ngreat success, financially and otherwise, as the press of the day\r\ngave evidence. Quitting the business he had served, or which had\r\nserved him so well, he engaged in other pursuits with varied success.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1875, he was united in marriage with Miss Sarah E. (Rowe)\r\nJackson, a graduate of Hahnemann Medical College, Chicago. In honor\r\nof her that college conferred on our subject the honorary degree of\r\nM.D. with two diplomas (having earned and received a diploma from the\r\n\"Old School\" while lecturing), he declined to practice the healing\r\nart. No children from this union.\r\n\r\nHe became interested in real estate in Iowa and Chicago.
